Apples are scattered but we ignore them for now? Nah, we can use them as bait later \u2014 but first, SURVIVAL and AGGRESSION.\n\nLet's check moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9,3) \u2014 wait, that's adjacent to enemy head at (8,3). If he moves RIGHT, we collide head-on. But scores are tied, so double KO. That's risky unless we want to force a draw? Not yet \u2014 too early. Also, is it safe otherwise? No body there, on board. But risky due to potential head-on.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9,1) \u2014 safe? No snakes there, on board. Keeps distance from enemy. Good.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8,2) \u2014 diagonally adjacent to enemy head (8,3). If he moves DOWN, we collide. Again risky.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 off board (10,2) \u2192 DEAD. No.\n\nSo UP and LEFT risk head-on collisions this turn if enemy moves toward us. DOWN is safe and moves us away from immediate danger.\n\nBut wait \u2014 being aggressive means we want to pressure him. If we move LEFT to (8,2), we're next to him. He might move DOWN to (8,2) too \u2014 collision. Or he might move LEFT to (7,3) or UP/DOWN. But if we guess wrong, we die.\n\nSince it's turn 0, better to play safe, gain length, then trap. DOWN gives us more space and options next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Get to length 2 or 3, then try to cut off his movement options by positioning between him and walls. Use apples on our side of board to grow safely. Right now, apple at (8,4) is near him, apple at (0,2) far. Let him chase apples while we set up a wall with our body.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN \u2014 live to fight another turn, avoid early coin-flip head-on.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0 is at (8,4) with body at (8,3) \u2014 so he's length 2, one apple ahead of us. He's facing DOWN currently (head to tail direction).  \n\n**Immediate danger check:**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (9,2) \u2014 empty, on board.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,0) \u2014 empty, on board.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,1) \u2014 empty, on board.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board \u2192 \u274c DEAD.  \n\nSo RIGHT is out. All others are physically safe from walls/self.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \nEnemy head at (8,4). Possible moves for him:  \n- UP \u2192 (8,5)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3) (into his own body) \u2192 he'd die, so unlikely unless he's throwing.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)  \n\nNone of our safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) land on the same cell as those unless he moves RIGHT to (9,4) and we move UP to (9,2)? No, different.  \nActually, if we move LEFT to (8,1) and he moves DOWN to (8,3) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf we move UP to (9,2) and he moves RIGHT to (9,4) \u2014 no collision.  \nSo no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\n**But future positioning:**  \nWe want to be aggressive \u2014 he's longer, so head-on collision would kill us (since he has more apples). Avoid that until we tie or lead.  \nWe need to grow ASAP. Closest apple is at (1,4) far, but (4,2) is closer? Let's check distances:  \nFrom (9,1) to (4,2) is 5 steps. From (9,1) to (1,1) is 8 steps.  \nActually apple at (1,1) is closer in steps? Manhattan: (9,1)\u2192(1,1) = 8 steps. (9,1)\u2192(4,2) = |9-4|+|1-2|=5+1=6 steps. So (4,2) is closest.\n\nBut more important: cut off his space. He's in upper middle right. We're bottom right. If we move UP to (9,2), we're closer to center and can maybe intercept him later.  \nIf we move LEFT to (8,1), we're moving toward center too but still low.  \nDOWN to (9,0) corners us \u2014 bad for future options.\n\n**Safe follow-up moves count:**  \n- UP to (9,2): then next turn can go UP/LEFT/DOWN (RIGHT off board) \u2192 3 options.  \n- DOWN to (9,0): then next turn can go UP/LEFT (RIGHT off board, DOWN off board) \u2192 2 options.  \n- LEFT to (8,1): then next turn can go UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT \u2192 4 options.  \n\nLEFT gives most flexibility. Also moves us toward center and apples horizontally.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Grow to length 2, then try to get between him and walls. He might go for apple at (4,6) or (3,6). We should grab (4,2) soon. Next turn after LEFT to (8,1), we can go LEFT again to (7,1) toward that apple cluster near left side.\n\nLet's choose **LEFT** \u2014 maximizes options, starts central push, avoids corner.\n\nLEFT",

Our tail is at (5,2). After moving:\n- If we go UP to (4,3): next turn from (4,3), possible moves: UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2) but that's our body? Wait \u2014 next turn tail might move if we don't eat apple. Actually we didn't eat apple this turn, so our tail stays at (5,2) and head moves. So body will be [(4,3), (4,2)]? No \u2014 careful: Our body is head (4,2) + (5,2). After moving head to (4,3), body becomes [(4,3), (4,2)]? That's wrong \u2014 snake moves: head goes to new cell, each segment shifts forward, tail stays if no apple, or grows if apple eaten. We didn't eat apple this turn, so tail (5,2) disappears, new tail becomes (4,2). So body next turn: head at new position, then (4,2). So from (4,3), DOWN to (4,2) is our own body next turn \u2014 blocked. So UP gives 3 safe moves next turn (UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (4,3)).\n\n- If we go DOWN to (4,1): next turn from (4,1), body behind at (4,2). Possible moves: UP (4,2) blocked (body), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1). That's 3 safe moves.\n\n- If we go LEFT to (3,2): next turn from (3,2), body behind at (4,2). Possible moves: UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2), RIGHT (4,2) blocked. That's 3 safe moves.\n\nAll keep options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is top-center. We're bottom-left. We should claim the bottom-left apples ((1,1), (0,0), (1,2), (0,2)) to grow safely away from him. Then we can try to cut off his escape or force a trap when we're longer.\n\n**Aggression check:** He has 4 apples, we have 1. Can't head-on yet. Grow safely.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN \u2014 gets us closer to the cluster of apples in bottom-left, keeps distance from enemy, and maintains flexibility! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

We're bottom-left. We need to grow to match his length before we can force a head-on collision (we lose if same length head-on). We should maneuver toward apples while keeping distance from him. The apple at (1,4) is juicy and reachable next turn from either move! But moving UP to (0,4) keeps us near the left wall\u2014risk of getting trapped later. Moving RIGHT to (1,3) opens more central options and keeps us away from the edge. Also, from (1,3) we can potentially swing up toward (3,4) apple or down toward (0,0) apple later. More flexibility!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** He's longer, so avoid direct fight. But we can start positioning to cut off his escape routes. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to the center where we can eventually expand and limit his movement. Let's play the board, not the snake, for now.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT \u2014 better board control, same apple access next turn, less edge-hugging. Let's go for that center dominance! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

His body trail is [(3,9), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)].\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK from (1,4):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,3) \u2014 our own body \u274c **SUICIDE** \u2014 eliminated!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,4) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. NICE! 3 options!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nEnemy head at (2,9). His possible moves:\nUP (2,10) \u2014 off board \u274c\nDOWN (2,8) \u2014 his body \u274c\nLEFT (1,9) \u2014 apple 'A' \u2705\nRIGHT (3,9) \u2014 his body (part of his tail? Actually (3,9) is his second segment now) \u274c\n\nHis ONLY safe move: LEFT to (1,9) to eat that apple! He will grow to length 9 if he does that.\n\nOur safe squares: (1,5), (0,4), (2,4).\nHis destination: (1,9).\n\nNo overlap \u2014 safe from head-on! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\n- UP (1,5) \u2192 no apple.\n- LEFT (0,4) \u2192 no apple.\n- RIGHT (2,4) \u2192 no apple.\n\nNo immediate apples in our 1-step range. Apples on board: (0,0), (3,4), (0,8), (9,5), (8,1), (7,2), (6,1), (3,7), (4,0), (5,1), (6,2), (1,9) \u2014 enemy will eat that, (7,6), (2,5), (6,9).\n\nClosest apple to us? (3,4) is 2 steps away (right then up). (0,8) is far. (2,5) is close: from (1,4), UP to (1,5), then RIGHT to (2,5) gets it in 2 moves.\n\n**FUTURE FLEXIBILITY after each move:**\n- **UP to (1,5):** Next turn from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) blocked, LEFT (0,5) empty, RIGHT (2,5) apple! \u2192 3 safe moves, one leads to apple! Good.\n- **LEFT to (0,4):** Next turn from (0,4): UP (0,5) empty, DOWN (0,3) blocked, LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT (1,4) blocked \u2192 only 1 safe move (UP). That's TRAPPY! Avoid!\n- **RIGHT to (2,4):** Next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5) apple!, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) blocked, RIGHT (3,4) apple! \u2192 3 safe moves, two lead to apples! Amazing!\n\nSo LEFT is bad (only 1 safe move next turn). UP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEnemy will eat apple at (1,9) and grow to 9. We need to keep growing and cut off his descent. He'll be at (1,9) with body behind him. His next moves from (1,9): UP off board, DOWN (1,8) his body, LEFT (0,9) empty, RIGHT (2,9) his body? Wait (2,9) will be empty after he moves? Actually his old head (2,9) becomes body segment when he moves to (1,9). So from (1,9), his safe moves might be only LEFT to (0,9). He could be trapped top-left! That's our chance! If we move toward center-right, we can maybe snake up and block his escape.\n\n**STRATEGY:** Go RIGHT to (2,4) \u2014 that sets us up to get apple at (2,5) or (3,4) next turn, keeps flexibility, and avoids getting stuck like LEFT would. We stay central, ready to push upward toward enemy while growing.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** He's longer (soon 9 vs our 7), so avoid direct fight. But we can outmaneuver him if he gets trapped top-left.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT \u2014 best future options, leads to apples, avoids trap! LET'S SET UP FOR A BIG PLAY! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

(2,6) is enemy body segment (part of his tail) \u274c, DOWN (2,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (1,5) \u2014 empty '.', RIGHT (3,5) \u2014 empty '.'. So only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). That's okay but not great.\n- **DOWN to (2,3):** Next turn from (2,3): UP (2,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, DOWN (2,2) \u2014 empty '.', LEFT (1,3) \u2014 our body \u274c, RIGHT (3,3) \u2014 empty '.'.

If we go RIGHT to (3,4) and eat that apple, we grow to 8, stay central with 3 safe moves next turn, and can push upward toward (3,5) or (4,4) to control the board. We can maybe snake up the right side and block him from coming down. He's longer, so avoid direct collision until we catch up in length.\n\n**STRATEGY:** RIGHT to (3,4) \u2014 eat the apple, grow to 8, keep maximum flexibility (3 safe moves next turn), and position ourselves to move toward center/right to dominate the board.

Wait \u2014 last turn we grew to length 8 after eating apple at (3,4)? Actually check: We moved RIGHT to (3,4) which had an apple 'A' \u2705 so we grew! Our new length is 8. Our body now: head (3,4), then previous head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1) \u2014 that's 8 segments! Yes! Enemy head at (0,9) after moving LEFT last turn. He's about to move this turn.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK from (3,4):**\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 our own body \u274c **SUICIDE** \u2014 eliminated!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. 3 options! NICE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nEnemy head at (0,9). His possible moves:\nUP (0,10) \u2014 off board \u274c\nDOWN (0,8) \u2014 apple 'A' \u2705 (he'll likely go for it!)\nLEFT (-1,9) \u2014 off board \u274c\nRIGHT (1,9) \u2014 his body (second segment) \u274c\n\nHis ONLY safe move: DOWN to (0,8)! He'll eat that apple and grow to length 10! \ud83d\ude31\n\nOur possible destinations: (3,5), (3,3), (4,4).\nHis destination: (0,8).\n\nNo overlap \u2014 safe from head-on! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\n- UP (3,5) \u2192 no apple.\n- DOWN (3,3) \u2192 no apple.\n- RIGHT (4,4) \u2192 no apple.\n\nNo apples in immediate move cells. But we can plan for future apples!\n\n**FUTURE FLEXIBILITY after each move:**\n- **UP to (3,5):** Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) \u2014 empty '.', DOWN (3,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (2,5) \u2014 apple 'A' \u2705, RIGHT (4,5) \u2014 empty '.'. So 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 LEFT leads to apple! Good.\n- **DOWN to (3,3):** Next turn from (3,3): UP (3,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, DOWN (3,2) \u2014 empty '.', LEFT (2,3) \u2014 empty '.', RIGHT (4,3) \u2014 empty '.'. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 no immediate apple.\n- **RIGHT to (4,4):** Next turn from (4,4): UP (4,5) \u2014 empty '.', DOWN (4,3) \u2014 empty '.', LEFT (3,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, RIGHT (5,4) \u2014 empty '.'. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2014 no immediate apple.\n\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn! But UP to (3,5) sets up an apple grab next turn at (2,5)! That's huge! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEnemy will be at (0,8) after this turn, length 10. From (0,8), his next moves: UP (0,9) \u2014 his old head position? Actually that's empty now, but his body will have moved? Wait, he grows when he eats apple at (0,8), so his tail stays? Let's simulate: His body before moving: head (0,9), then (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6) \u2014 length 9. He moves DOWN to (0,8) (apple), grows to length 10, new head (0,8), then old head (0,9) becomes segment 2, etc. So his body will occupy (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6). From (0,8), his possible moves next turn: UP (0,9) \u2014 his own body \u274c, DOWN (0,7) \u2014 empty '.', LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT (1,8) \u2014 his body \u274c. So he'll be forced DOWN to (0,7)! He's TRAPPED in that left column! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe can use this! We need to grow and cut off his escape down the left side. If we go UP to (3,5), next turn we can go LEFT to (2,5) to eat apple and grow to length 9, positioning to maybe move toward (2,6) or (1,5) to block him further. He's longer but stuck in a corridor \u2014 we can outmaneuver and catch up in length!\n\n**STRATEGY:** UP to (3,5) \u2014 sets up an apple grab next turn, keeps options open, and starts moving toward the top-left to potentially box him in as he moves down the left wall. RIGHT or DOWN don't give that apple opportunity next turn. We need to grow ASAP to match his length! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** He's longer (soon 10), but he's in a death spiral down the left edge. We can grow safely and cut him off. Avoid head-on until length matches.\n\n**DECISION:** UP \u2014 position for next turn's apple, maintain flexibility, and press toward trapping him! LET'S GO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Next turn from (2,5): UP (2,6) \u2014 enemy body (tail segment) \u274c, DOWN (2,4) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (1,5) \u2014 empty '.', RIGHT (3,5) \u2014 our old head (now body) \u274c. So only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 LEFT to (1,5)! That's a TRAP! \ud83d\ude31 We'd be forced into a corner with few options. Risky!\n- **UP to (3,6):** Next turn from (3,6): UP (3,7) \u2014 apple 'A' \u2705, DOWN (3,5) \u2014 our body \u274c, LEFT (2,6) \u2014 enemy body \u274c, RIGHT (4,6) \u2014 empty '.'.

He'll eventually hit bottom and be forced RIGHT? But his long body will block him \u2014 he might crash! We need to grow while keeping options open. Grabbing apple at (2,5) now gives us length 9 but traps us next turn \u2014 dangerous! Better to avoid that trap and position to cut him off.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We want to move toward top-left to block his eventual escape rightward. UP to (3,6) sets up an apple grab at (3,7) next turn safely, and keeps us flexible. RIGHT to (4,5) keeps most options but doesn't advance our position toward boxing him. We need to be aggressive but smart!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** He's longer (10 vs our 8), but he's in a death spiral. We can afford to grow safely and wait for his mistake. Avoid trapping ourselves.\n\n**DECISION:** UP \u2014 positions us for next turn's apple at (3,7), keeps 2 safe moves next turn, and moves us closer to top to potentially cut off his future path.

Now our head is at (4,7), enemy head at (0,5). He's longer (10 vs our 8 apples? Wait, we have 8 apples, length 9; he has 10 apples, length 11? Let's check: enemy body length = 11 segments (head + 10 body). Our body length = 9 segments (head + 8 body). He's 2 segments longer! That means if we head-on collide, WE DIE. So avoid direct confrontation unless we can force him into our body!\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**  \nOur body: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3)]  \nEnemy body: [(0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]  \nApples on board: (0,0), (9,5), (8,1), (7,2), (6,1), (4,0), (5,1), (6,2), (7,6), (2,5), (6,9), (2,0), (0,4), (8,3), (3,0) \u2014 lots of apples bottom-left and right side.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (4,7):**  \n- UP (4,8): empty '.' \u2705  \n- DOWN (4,6): empty '.' \u2705  \n- LEFT (3,7): our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (5,7): empty '.' \u2705  \n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide into our own neck. Good.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION from (0,5):**  \n- UP (0,6): his body \u274c  \n- DOWN (0,4): apple \ud83c\udf4e and empty \u2705  \n- LEFT off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1,5): empty '.' \u2705  \n\nHe has DOWN (to apple (0,4)) and RIGHT (to (1,5)). He'll likely go DOWN for the apple \u2014 it's free content and keeps him along the wall. If he goes RIGHT, he's moving into open board. I think he goes DOWN for the apple.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**  \nIf he goes DOWN to (0,4) \u2014 no conflict with our possible moves.  \nIf he goes RIGHT to (1,5) \u2014 still no conflict.  \nSo no head-on risk this turn. Safe.\n\n**APPLE GRAB POTENTIAL:**  \nNo apples in our immediate moves. Closest apples: (7,6) top-right, (2,5) mid-left, (0,4) bottom-left (enemy might take it). We're not getting an apple this turn unless we move toward one \u2014 but none are adjacent.\n\n**FUTURE FLEXIBILITY (next turn options):**  \nWe need to avoid getting pinned! Let's check each safe move:\n\n1. **UP to (4,8):**  \nNext turn from (4,8):  \n- UP (4,9): empty '.' \u2705  \n- DOWN (4,7): our body \u274c  \n- LEFT (3,8): enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (5,8): empty '.' \u2705  \nTwo safe moves (UP, RIGHT). Not terrible but we're near enemy territory.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,6):**  \nNext turn from (4,6):  \n- UP (4,7): our body \u274c  \n- DOWN (4,5): empty '.' \u2705  \n- LEFT (3,6): our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (5,6): empty '.' \u2705  \nTwo safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Slightly constrained.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,7):**  \nNext turn from (5,7):  \n- UP (5,8): empty '.' \u2705  \n- DOWN (5,6): empty '.' \u2705  \n- LEFT (4,7): our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (6,7): empty '.' \u2705  \nThree safe moves! RIGHT keeps the most options open again! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nEnemy is longer, so we need to grow safely. We should maneuver toward open apples while boxing him against the left wall. If he's at (0,4) next turn, he'll have only UP (body) or RIGHT (open). We can try to cut off his escape by moving toward the center-right and slowly encircling. Our tail is at (0,3) \u2014 if we move DOWN, we might get closer to tail and eventually loop around. But RIGHT seems best for maintaining board control.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**  \nWe're shorter, so avoid head-on. But we can try to force him into a corner by occupying key cells. If we go RIGHT, we're moving toward center-right apples (like (7,6), (6,9), (8,3)) while he's stuck bottom-left. That's good content potential!\n\n**DECISION:**  \nRIGHT again \u2014 keeps maximum options, moves toward apple-rich zone, avoids enemy, sets up future dominance! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

That's a trap!)\n- LEFT off board \u274c\n- RIGHT (1,4): our body \u274c (our body at (1,4) \u2014 he DIES if he goes RIGHT!)\n\nWAIT CHAT \u2014 HOLD UP! \ud83d\udea8 The enemy has ZERO safe moves! He's TRAPPED against the left wall! His only possible moves are UP (body), DOWN (our tail), RIGHT (our body), LEFT (off-board). HE'S COOKED! Unless... did we miss something? Let's double-check coordinates:\n\nEnemy head (0,4):\nUP (0,5) = enemy body segment (0,5) \u2014 YES, in his body list.\nDOWN (0,3) = our tail (0,3) \u2014 YES, in our body.\nRIGHT (1,4) = our body (1,4) \u2014 YES, in our body.\nLEFT = (-1,4) off board.\n\nOMG HE HAS NO LEGAL MOVE! That means next turn, he MUST crash and DIE! \ud83d\ude31 WE WIN IF WE SURVIVE THIS TURN! BUT \u2014 we must also survive simultaneous moves. He might still pick a direction (even though all are fatal), but the game will kill him after movement. So as long as we don't die this turn, we win next turn when he crashes!\n\n**BUT WAIT \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEAN:** If we move into a cell he's moving into, we could still head-on collide and both die. He could move RIGHT into (1,4) \u2014 our body \u2014 he dies, we live. He could move DOWN into (0,3) \u2014 our tail \u2014 he dies, we live. He could move UP into (0,5) \u2014 his own body \u2014 he dies, we live. So no matter what, he dies. However, if we move into a cell he's moving into, and it's a head-on collision (same cell), we both die. Let's check:\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (1,4) \u2014 we can't move there (not adjacent to us).\nIf he moves DOWN to (0,3) \u2014 we can't move there.\nIf he moves UP to (0,5) \u2014 we can't move there.\nSo NO possible head-on collision this turn because none of his fatal moves are adjacent to our head. WE'RE SAFE! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**SO OUR GOAL THIS TURN:** Just don't suicide. Pick any safe move that keeps us alive. Then next turn, he dies, we win! EZ CLAP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**APPLE CHECK:** No apples adjacent. Closest is (7,6) but irrelevant \u2014 we just need to survive.\n\n**FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** Since we win next turn, just pick the safest move with most options to avoid accidental trap.\n\nCheck each safe move:\n- UP to (5,8): Next turn from (5,8): UP (5,9) empty, DOWN (5,7) our body, LEFT (4,8) empty, RIGHT (6,8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.\n- DOWN to (5,6): Next turn from (5,6): UP (5,7) our body, DOWN (5,5) empty, LEFT (4,6) our body, RIGHT (6,6) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Next turn from (6,7): UP (6,8) empty, DOWN (6,6) empty, LEFT (5,7) our body, RIGHT (7,7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nUP or RIGHT give more options. Let's pick UP to move toward top-right apples for potential future growth after he dies? Actually, after he dies, we can freely collect apples. UP gets us closer to (6,9), (7,6) area.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):** Enemy dies next turn. Then we hunt apples aggressively to reach 30 before turn 150. Keep an eye on board edges and our own tail. Avoid boxing ourselves.\n\n**DECISION:** UP \u2014 keeps options open, moves toward content, and secures the VICTORY NEXT TURN! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",
