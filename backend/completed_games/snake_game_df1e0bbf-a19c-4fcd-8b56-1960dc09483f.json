LEFT blocked by body (immediate self-collision/backwards move). UP off the board.\n- Eliminating unsafe moves: Same as above; no enemy body adjacent, but potential future head-on risks if enemy moves toward us.\n- Evaluating safe moves for strategy: Both keep me alive, but priorities are increasing safe apple access while avoiding traps and preserving forward options.\n  - DOWN (to 3,8): Directly progresses toward the closest apple at (3,4) with a clear path down the open column (rows 9-4 are empty). From (3,8), multiple follow-up options emerge (DOWN, LEFT to 2,8, RIGHT to 4,8), keeping space open and centralizing for further apple hunts like (6,4). Avoids narrowing choices. Positions me mid-board vertically toward apples without immediate traps. Also distances from enemy snake at (7,7), reducing head-on collision risks if they target (8,8) or (6,4).\n  - RIGHT (to 4,9): Takes me eastward toward a potential path to (6,4), but from there (4,9), only 2 safe options (DOWN or RIGHT) remain, limiting flexibility early. Row 9 is constraining (can't go UP forever), and this might box me into sides sooner if not careful. Less directly toward apples compared to down.\n- Preferred move: DOWN prioritizes immediate apple access at (3,4) while expanding future move options (more from (3,8) than (4,9)). Aligns with keeping the board source open and avoiding enemy proximity risks. Enemy at (7,7) might target (6,4) or edges, so coursing down via the center maximizes safety and scoring.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After going DOWN to (3,8), continue south toward the apple at (3,4) if the path stays clear, likely reaching it in 1-2 more turns (via DOWN to 3,7 then 3,6/5/4). Post-eat, avoid retreating north if possible to prevent backtracking into body\u2014pivot right toward (6,4) for the next central apple, keeping distance from enemy at (7,7) who may compete for (6,4) or (8,8). Monitor for enemy moves that could block column 4-6 or force head-ons; prioritize vertical pivots in open areas to maintain options, aiming to grow length while circling back to score near columns 1 or 0 if needed. Keep apples at (1,3) and (0,0) as backup if paths diverge.\n\nDOWN",

UP invalid (off board or into own body). No immediate self-collisions or enemy body risks; enemy head at (7,8) is not adjacent, but simultaneous head-on possible if moving parallel (e.g., both right toward column 4 from row 8).\n- Eliminating unsafe moves: As above\u2014UP disallowed externally or internally. No enemy body at (3,7), (2,8), (4,8) now, but enemy may move his head away from his tail at (7,7) this turn.\n- Evaluating safe moves for strategy: All safe, but prioritize apple progress (closest: (3,4) via DOWN with clear column path) while maximizing follow-up options (DOWN leaving 3 directions open from (3,7): DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT; RIGHT leaving 2: DOWN, RIGHT; LEFT leaving 3: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Avoid closing off or risking head-ons\u2014enemy likely targeting (8,8) apple immediately via RIGHT from (7,8) to (8,8), eating next turn and growing, which could block central board; DOWN keeps vertical separation, distancing us. LEFT/RIGHT as viable backups if DOWN path clogs unexpectedly, positioning for pivots toward (6,4) or edges later.\n- Preferred move: DOWN aligns with last turn's rationale\u2014direct path south to (3,4) apple (4 turns away: (3,8)->(3,7)->(3,6)->(3,5)->(3,4), all confirmed open). Maintains central mobility, reduces enemy proximity risk (enemy moving right/west reduces shared row/column threats), and eats apple efficiently while preserving options to pivot left/right post-eat for (1,3)/(0,0) or (6,4) without self-trapping. LEFT/RIGHT detour paths lack immediate apple payoff and less central control.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After DOWN to (3,7), continue DOWN south to eat (3,4), taking 3 more turns if unblocked ([(3,7),(3,8)] body afterward restricts UP to (3,8); avoid using it). Post-eat at (3,4), use new segment length to pivot left to (2,4) or right to (4,4?) for space/opening toward (6,4) apple or other openings (1,3)/(0,0) edges if blocked. Watch enemy\u2014likely growing soon at (8,8), potentially closing column 7-8; keep distance, prefer vertical/central fluidity over edges. If column 3 blocks, shift laterally early via RIGHT/LEFT from (3,7)/(3,6) for backups. Prioritize apple over enemy tail-chasing; aim for 50 in 150 turns.\n\nDOWN",

Length 4 including head.\n\nValid moves (no immediate death: not off-board, not into own body, not into enemy body):\n- **UP**: To (1, 5) \u2013 invalid, directly into my own body (neck).\n- **DOWN**: To (1, 3) \u2013 valid and ideal; eats the apple there, gaining a point (my apples to 4), grows me to length 5, and moves toward left-cluster apples ((0, 1) and (0, 0)). Keeps vertical column open for follow-up. No walls, enemy bodies, or collision risks here. Opens paths left (x=0) or right (x=2) after eating.\n- **LEFT**: To (0, 4) \u2013 valid; explores the left column but ignores the closer apple at (1, 3). Less greedier for points; I'd have to loop back or zigzag to eat (1, 3). Safer, less trapped, but delays immediate growth.\n- **RIGHT**: To (2, 4) \u2013 valid; explores right but further from apples. Enemy snake #1 is centered (head at (7, 2)), so this doesn't trap me or risk collision yet. However, prioritizes middle ground over clear vertical apple lanes.\n\nEnemy snake #1 (length 4 including head) is at (7, 2) with body [(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)]. They can move UP (to 7, 3), DOWN (to 7, 1), LEFT (to 6, 2 \u2013 own body, invalid? Wait, (6, 2) is their neck, so yes invalid), or RIGHT (to 8, 2 \u2013 valid). Likely they'll explore right (toward (9, 6)) or down; no threat to my x=1 stripe. 3-3 apple tie; eating first keeps parity or leads.\n\nAmong safe moves, DOWN maximizes immediate growth, safety, and options (from (1, 3) post-eat: LEFT to (0, 3), DOWN to (1, 2), or RIGHT to (2, 3) all open). Mirrors last plan's priority on (1, 3).\n\n### Plan for Next Turns (to Future Self)\nPost-eat at (1, 3), prioritize LEFT to x=0 for the stacked apples at (0, 1) and (0, 0)\u2014downward path is clear with no blockers. This builds a 5-apple lead potential while staying in a wide lane. Ignore right apples until left is cleared; monitor enemy if they shift our way, but pivot to x=2 if needed to block or chase.\n\nDOWN",

From here, a series of six UP moves\u2014starting now and continuing adequately safely to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then (2,6)\u2014will reach it without detours. No obstacles (own body, enemy, or board edges) block this path initially: (2,1) and beyond are empty per the board state.\n\nRIGHT to (3,0) keeps viable paths open (RIGHT again to (4,0), or UP toward (3,6) then LEFT to (2,6)), but it's a slight inefficiency detour to the same apple (7 moves total via UP to (3,6) then LEFT). It doesn't advance directly toward the apple as quickly and reduces safety compared to the straight UP approach, which avoids potential traps or enemy interference longer.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe with multiple follow-up options each (UP keeps 3 directions available next; RIGHT keeps 2). However, prioritizing apple proximity and the last plan's momentum favors UP to start the direct sequence. Enemy at (7,3) poses no immediate head-on threat (e.g., unlikely to move RIGHT to (8,3) or DOWN to (7,2) to intersect soon), so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nShort long-term plan to future self: Execute the next 5 UP moves consecutively to reach and eat the apple at (2,6), gaining a growth segment and point. This keeps the snake compact and evasive while growing ahead. Upon eating it, pivot toward the next viable apple like (6,6) or (9,6) based on enemy position and board openness\u2014avoid cramped spaces like the left side and prioritize multi-option paths to stay flexible.\n\nUP",
