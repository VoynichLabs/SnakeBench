If I move directly towards the apple at (7, 1), I might get too close to the enemy snake and risk hitting it or getting blocked.\n\nA safer strategy could be to first move down towards the apple at (1, 7), as it's a bit further away from the enemy snake. Once I eat that apple, I can then move towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board, keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nTo summarize my strategy for this turn:\n1.
