We're LIVE on turn 0 and we're ready to dominate! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down.\n\n**MY POSITION & THE BOARD:**\n- I'm at **(8, 0)** with no body yet. Fresh start, baby! \ud83d\ude80\n- Enemy Snake #0 is at **(3, 4)**. We're relatively close horizontally but he's way up vertically.\n- Apples are scattered everywhere, but the closest ones to me are:\n  - **(6, 0)** - 2 steps left\n  - **(9, 5)** - 1 step up, 1 step right from my current position\n  - **(7, 5)** - 1 step up, 1 step left from my current position\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- **LEFT** to (7, 0): This is safe (no snake bodies here) and moves me toward the apple at (6, 0).\n- **RIGHT** to (9, 0): Safe! This puts me right next to the apple at (9, 5) - just gotta go up after.\n- **UP** to (8, 1): Safe! Opens up pathways to the apples at (7, 5) and (9, 5).\n- **DOWN** to (8, -1): DEAD! Off the board. \u274c\n\n**ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**\nChat, we need to think ahead. The enemy is at (3, 4) - he's hunting apples on the left side. I should claim the right side of the board! Here's the play:\n\n- If I go **RIGHT** to (9, 0), I'm immediately adjacent to the apple at (9, 5). I can chase that next turn and claim territory on the right edge.\n- If I go **LEFT** to (7, 0), I'm chasing the closer apple at (6, 0), but that's deep in the center-left where the enemy might be heading.\n- If I go **UP** to (8, 1), I'm splitting the difference but moving toward the center.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE: RIGHT!**\nWhy RIGHT? Because I'm cutting off the right side of the board from the enemy! By moving to (9, 0), I claim the right edge and set up to grab the apple at (9, 5). This boxes the enemy into the left/center section. Aggressive positioning wins games!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the right side \u2192 Go for (9, 5) apple \u2192 Force enemy into center-left \u2192 Trap him when I grow! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**FINAL CALL:** RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

Who's ready to box 'em in?! \ud83d\ude0f\n\nQuick scan (thinking aloud like the chat wants):\n- Our head: (3,4). Opponent head: (8,0). No bodies on either side \u2014 both of us are solo speed demons rn.\n- Immediate-death moves? None. All four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are on-board and free.\n- Head-on risk this turn? Extremely low \u2014 their head is far away at (8,0). They can go to (8,1), (7,0), or (9,0). No overlapping with our adjacent cells this step.\n\nEvaluate moves (safety, follow-ups, aggression):\n- UP -> (3,5): safe, 4 follow-up options, but increases distance to the enemy (from 9 \u2192 10). Not aggressive.\n- DOWN -> (3,3): safe, 4 follow-ups, decreases distance to enemy (9 \u2192 8). Also puts us one step from the apple at (3,2). Good for early growth to dominate.\n- LEFT -> (2,4): safe, 4 follow-ups, but actually increases distance to enemy (9 \u2192 10). Not ideal for aggression.\n- RIGHT -> (4,4): safe, 4 follow-ups, decreases distance to enemy (9 \u2192 8) \u2014 also reasonable.\n\nDecision: DOWN. Why?\n- It moves us closer to the opponent while keeping maximum escape options (4 open neighbors after the move).\n- It also puts us one move away from the apple at (3,2) so we can grow quickly and then start pressuring/boxing the enemy.\n- No head-on danger this turn; we should avoid a head-on unless we're already ahead. Right now we want the size advantage first, then force collisions.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 save this as \"last rationale\" next turn):\n- Move DOWN to (3,3), then either grab (3,2) apple next turn to grow.\n- After getting the apple, pivot right/up to head toward the opponent\u2019s half\u2014use size to cut off escape lanes.\n- Avoid risky head-on collisions until we have at least a +1 apple lead; then force the clash if they corner themselves.\n\nTime to make the move and start the box-in! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

I'm on the right edge.\n- Enemy Snake #0 is at **(3, 3)**. He's still chilling left-center.\n- Apples: I see (9, 5) above me - that's 5 steps up. (7, 5) is also reachable. But more importantly, there's an apple at **(1, 0)** and **(2, 0)** which are closer to the enemy. He's at (3, 3) - he might go for (3, 2) or (3, 4) apples first.\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- **UP** to (9, 1): SAFE! That's the move toward (9, 5) apple. Opens up the top-right.\n- **DOWN** to (9, -1): DEAD! Off the board. \u274c\n- **LEFT** to (8, 0): SAFE! This brings me toward the center apples. Opens up pathways to (8, 2), (7, 5), etc.\n- **RIGHT** to (10, 0): DEAD! Off the board. \u274c\n\n**ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**\nChat, we're already boxed in on the right edge - that's good for defense! Now we need to claim territory. The enemy is at (3, 3), so he's probably thinking about the apples at (3, 2) or (3, 4) or (1, 0) or (2, 0). Those are all closer to him.\n\nMy best play is **UP**! Why?\n1. Gets me closer to **(9, 5)** - a solid apple on the edge\n2. Maintains my position on the right side, cutting off the enemy from claiming the right edge\n3. Gives me options next turn to either go left toward (8, 5) or continue up toward (9, 5)\n4. If I go LEFT, I'm moving into the center where the enemy might be heading - we want to avoid that zone!\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE: UP!**\nI'm claiming the right side vertical!

Not aggressive.\n- LEFT -> (2,3): safe but sideways; doesn\u2019t cash in immediate growth or pressure.\n- RIGHT -> (4,3): moves toward the opponent\u2019s x but doesn\u2019t get growth and wastes tempo.\n- DOWN -> (3,2): grabs the apple this turn, grows to +1, and gives us the size edge to start boxing. Still plenty of escape options after eating.\n\nWhy DOWN?\n- Grabbing (3,2) early gives us the growth advantage we want.

Still on the right edge, perfect position.\n- **Enemy status:** Snake #0 at (3, 2) with 1 apple - they're moving toward those bottom-left apples like (3,0) or (1,0). Smart.\n- **My body:** Still just my head - no tail yet. Clean slate!\n- **Apple map:** I see (9, 5) above me, (8, 5) to my left-up, and (7, 5) further in. Right edge is MINE!\n\n**MOVES CHECK - ELIMINATING THE BAD ONES:**\n\n**UP to (9, 2):** \n- CHECKS OUT! Safe, clear path ahead.\n- Moves me toward (9, 5) apple - distance decreasing from 4 to 3 cells.\n- Keeps me on the right edge, boxing enemy out from this side.\n- Enemy is at (3, 2) - they're 6 cells away horizontally, no collision risk this turn.\n\n**DOWN to (9, 0):**\n- SAFE! I just came from there, but it's still open.\n- However, I'm retreating back to where I was - gives up ground I just claimed!\n- Moves me AWAY from apples - no strategic value.\n\n**LEFT to (8, 1):**\n- CHECKS OUT! Safe move.\n- Brings me closer to center, which is DANGEROUS territory.\n- Enemy is at (3, 2) - if they go RIGHT, they could head toward me.\n- This gives up my edge advantage - why move inward when I can claim the perimeter?\n\n**RIGHT to (10, 1):**\n- DEAD! Off the board. Game over. \u274c\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, I'm staying on that right edge! The enemy is playing the left/center - let them! By going UP to (9, 2), I:\n1. **Claim territory** on the right side\n2. **Close the gap** to (9, 5) apple - that's my next meal\n3. **Avoid the center chaos** where the enemy is roaming\n4. **Keep options open** - I can go LEFT from (9, 2) to reach (8, 5) or keep going UP\n\nIf I go DOWN, I'm literally backtracking like a coward! If I go LEFT, I'm walking into enemy territory while he's hungry and has an apple lead.\n\n**THE MOVE: UP!**\nStaying hungry on the edge! I'm coming for those right-side apples while the enemy fights for scraps in the middle. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep climbing toward (9, 5) \u2192 Grab that apple \u2192 Continue claiming the right edge \u2192 Wait for enemy to overextend \u2192 CRUSH HIM when he's vulnerable! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP!\n\nUP",

Lots of apples on the board but we prioritize pressuring the enemy via size.\n- Important: moving UP -> (3,3) is moving directly backwards into our body. That is an instant death. Not happening.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- UP -> (3,3): illegal \u2014 would bite our own neck. Dead.\n- LEFT -> (2,2): safe, keeps options open but skips a juicy apple and doesn\u2019t increase our immediate leverage.\n- DOWN -> (3,1): safe, can head toward (3,0) next turn to grab another apple, but it\u2019s slower to rack up score.\n- RIGHT -> (4,2): safe AND there's an apple at (4,2). Grabbing it this turn gives us a bigger size/score advantage (would be 2 vs their 0), which lets us start forcing head-on pressure later or use our body to cut lanes.\n\nTactical choice:\n- We want apples to force favorable head-ons and to box them in. RIGHT gets a point immediately, keeps multiple escape options, and increases our ability to be aggressive on future turns. Opponent is too far to threaten a head-on this turn.\n\nShort plan for next turns (save as last rationale next turn):\n- Eat (4,2) now (RIGHT) \u2192 go to 2 apples.\n- After growing, pivot slowly toward the opponent\u2019s half while avoiding tight corridors. Start cutting off their escape lanes and only force a head-on when we have a clear size/positional advantage.\n- Keep watching their moves: if they try to cluster to a side, clamp them against the wall and close the trap.\n\nRIGHT",

Body behind: (3,2),(3,3). Cannot move LEFT \u2014 that\u2019s straight into our neck. Instant death. Not happening.\n- Opponent head: (9,2), no body. They\u2019re 5 cells to our right on the same row and there\u2019s an apple at (8,2) tempting them to come left.\n- We\u2019re up 2\u20130. That gives us leverage to be aggressive and pressure for collisions later \u2014 but we don\u2019t want to suicide unless it\u2019s a guaranteed win scenario.\n\nConsider moves:\n- LEFT -> illegal (back into (3,2)). X out.\n- UP -> to (4,3). Safe, preserves options vertically, no immediate pressure gain.\n- DOWN -> to (4,1). Safe, keeps options and can chase apples below, but slower to close on the rival.\n- RIGHT -> to (5,2). Safe, moves us toward the opponent, keeps both vertical escape routes, and starts compressing the horizontal space between us and them.\n\nWhat the enemy is likely to do:\n- They\u2019ll probably head LEFT toward (8,2) to grab that apple. That gives us the chance to chase and compress from the left without risking an immediate head-on. If they try to rush us head-first, we\u2019re bigger \u2014 we can look to force a head-on or let them run into our body.\n\nChosen short-term move rationale:\n- We want to shrink the horizontal room the opponent has and prepare to box them against the right wall or a choke around x=7\u20139. RIGHT is the most aggressive safe move that keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) and sets up future lane cuts.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n- Keep pushing right while monitoring their leftward apple chase.\n- Avoid trapping ourselves against the wall prematurely \u2014 keep at least one vertical escape.\n- If they overcommit into our cutting shape and a head-on becomes likely, only force it when we see they\u2019ll collide with our body or when a simultaneous head collision benefits us (we\u2019re already up 2).\n- If they peel away, pivot vertically to cut off escape lanes and herd them into a wall trap.\n\nRIGHT",

Aggressive \u2014 closes horizontal gap, preserves UP/DOWN/RIGHT follow-ups, starts to compress space on the right side.\n\nRisk check:\n- Opponent is too far to collide with our chosen target cells this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n- We won\u2019t be moving into any occupied enemy cell. No suicidal overlap.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 put this in the replay as our rationale next move):\n- Keep pushing RIGHT to shrink the horizontal room between us and #1. Force them toward x=9 wall or into tighter lanes.\n- Maintain at least one vertical escape so we don\u2019t box ourselves in\u2014use UP/DOWN as needed.\n- If they overcommit and run into our body, we let them die. If a head-on becomes unavoidable and simultaneous death leads to our victory (we\u2019re +2), we can opt for that as a last-resort win condition.\n- Prioritize cutting their lateral space rather than chasing far apples. Grow only when it helps dominate the choke.\n\nWe\u2019re going in \u2014 let\u2019s pinch him! \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

They're winning the score game - NOT IDEAL! \ud83d\ude24\n- **Apple (9, 5):** It's RIGHT THERE! One move UP and I'm eating.

I'd be skipping the apple RIGHT in front of me! That's letting the enemy run away with the lead.\n- From (8, 4), I'm moving closer to enemy territory - they're at (6, 2) - more collision risk.\n- **BAD MOMENTUM!** Why avoid the free apple?\n\n**DOWN to (9, 3):**\n- SAFE: Just came from there, empty.\n- **RETREATING!** I'd be going AWAY from the apple I was chasing. Awful positioning.\n- From (9, 3), I'd have to go UP again next turn - wasting time.\n- **WORST OPTION!** Don't give up ground.\n\n**RIGHT to (10, 4):**\n- **DEAD!** Off the board.

From there, I need to assess the enemy's movement. They might try to box me in or cut off my right edge. I'll likely go LEFT to (8, 5) to keep expanding my territory and maintain options, avoiding getting trapped against the wall.

They can\u2019t reach us this turn for a head-on.\n\nMove-by-move thinking:\n- UP (6,3): keeps lots of options (L/R/U), good for flexibility and avoids committing. Neutral pressure.\n- DOWN (6,1): also safe, more distance from enemy \u2014 slower to apply pressure.\n- RIGHT (7,2): aggressive, closes horizontal gap toward the enemy and puts us in position to threaten (8,2) and compress their lateral options against x=9.

But we must not walk into our own neck or into a trap with no escape.\n- RIGHT mobilizes our plan to corral them to the right wall while keeping at least one vertical escape (UP/DOWN) available next turns. It\u2019s the high-aggression, high-reward play that matches our objective: box him in and force mistakes.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Push RIGHT to x=7 to shrink his safe corridor. From there, keep pressing toward x=8 to threaten the 8\u20139 column choke. Use UP/DOWN as safety lanes so we don\u2019t self-box. If he overcommits toward us or tries a reckless run for apples, cut him off and force the head-on \u2014 we\u2019re +2, so double KO = our W.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure and make him crash.

My tail is at (9, 5) right now. I'd be moving directly into myself. DEAD! \u274c\n- **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, this is an EASY CALL!

Instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (8,3) safe. Keeps max flexibility (L/R/U/D next turn).\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1) safe. Conservative, keeps options.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) has an apple. Safe now, aggressive, grows us to 4 apples and moves us onto the right wall to start corralling #1.\n\nEnemy check: Opponent head at (8,5) with body (9,5),(9,4). They cannot move RIGHT (that\u2019s their neck). Their immediate moves are UP (8,6), LEFT (7,5) or DOWN (8,4). They\u2019re 3 rows above us \u2014 no immediate head-on next turn. We\u2019re already ahead on apples (3\u21924 if we take RIGHT vs their 2). Trading heads later favors us.\n\nRisk/reward:\n- UP/DOWN = safe and flexible but misses the instant apple and the chance to start boxing them on the right wall.\n- RIGHT = eats (9,2), +1 apple, tightens the right-wall pressure. We will momentarily sacrifice a left option (can't go back into our body), but gain vertical mobility on the wall to climb and threaten a cut-off. That\u2019s exactly the aggressive play we want.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 stash this for the next rationale):\n- TAKE the apple at (9,2) now to go to 4 apples and lock the right column presence.\n- Then move UP along x=9 to line up with their y-range (y=4\u20136). Force them to choose between staying pinned on x=9 or coming out into our trap. If they overcommit, bait a head-on \u2014 we\u2019re ahead, so we can accept a collision in our favor. Always keep one vertical escape to avoid self-boxing.\n\nLET\u2019S PRESS THE ADVANTAGE \u2014 grab the apple and start the squeeze. RIGHT",

Now I'm length 4 with 3 apples.\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #0 head at (9, 2) with body [(8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)]. They're at 4 apples - still leading 4-3.\n- **Apple Alert:** I see apples at (6, 6), (3, 7), (1, 2), (0, 9), (5, 9), (6, 0), (8, 9), (4, 2), (9, 1), and many others. Let's focus on strategic positioning.\n- **Threat Assessment:** Enemy is at (9, 2) - they're moving left toward (8, 2) or possibly up/down. They're in the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n**MOVES CHECK - ELIMINATING THE BAD ONES:**\n\n**UP to (7, 6):**\n- **SAFE:** Empty cell (confirmed by board state).\n- **BUT...** This puts me directly above my own tail at (7, 5)! From (7, 6), if I go DOWN next turn, I'd be moving back into my tail which is now at (7, 5). That's risky.\n- **Strategic value:** Moves me toward apples at (6, 6) and (3, 7). But I need to be careful about future options.\n\n**DOWN to (7, 4):**\n- **SAFE:** Empty cell (confirmed by board state).\n- **BUT...** From (7, 4), I could go DOWN again to (7, 3), but I'm moving away from most apples and toward the bottom edge where there are fewer opportunities.\n- **Strategic value:** Limited. I'd be in the middle of nowhere with few apple options nearby.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 5):**\n- **SAFE:** Empty cell (confirmed by board state).\n- **BUT...** From (6, 5), I could go UP to (6, 6) where there's an apple! Or LEFT to (5, 5), or DOWN to (6, 4).\n- **Strategic value:** Excellent! Moving toward apple at (6, 6) and positioning for the center of the board. From (6, 5), I have three solid options.\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n- **SAFE:** Empty cell (confirmed by board state).\n- **BUT...** This is moving back toward my tail at (9, 5) and (9, 4). From (8, 5), if I go RIGHT again, I'd be moving into my tail (9, 5). That's dangerous.\n- **Strategic value:** Poor. I'm moving away from most apples and toward the right edge where my tail is.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nChat, I need to play this SMART! The enemy is at (9, 2) - they might go UP to (9, 3) or LEFT to (8, 2). If they go UP, they're moving toward me. If they go LEFT, they're staying away.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 5) is the MOVE!** Why?\n1. **CENTRAL POSITIONING!** (6, 5) is the sweet spot - I'm right next to apple at (6, 6) AND I can see the entire board!\n2. **MULTIPLE OPTIONS!** From (6, 5), I can go UP to (6, 6) for the apple, LEFT to (5, 5), or DOWN to (6, 4) - maximum flexibility!\n3. **BLOCKING THE CENTER!** By taking the center-left, I'm cutting off the enemy's path to the top-right and forcing them to go around.\n4. **AVOIDING DEAD ENDS!** Unlike UP or RIGHT which risk moving into my own tail, LEFT keeps my path clear for multiple turns.\n5. **APPLE CHASE!** I'm setting up to grab that apple at (6, 6) next turn if it's still there!\n\n**THE MOVE: LEFT!**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nAfter moving to (6, 5), I'll watch the enemy's move. If they go UP toward the center, I might need to prepare a head-on collision strategy. If they stay low, I'll grab the apple at (6, 6) and dominate the upper-middle of the board. The key is to stay mobile and keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

NOPE. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,2) is our neck \u2014 backwards into ourselves = death. NOPE. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (9,3) is safe. Keeps vertical pressure on the right wall and keeps us aggressive.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,1) is safe AND there\u2019s an apple at (9,1) \u2014 instant +1 apple. Sweet.\n\nEnemy threat check:\n- Opponent head at (7,5) with body at (8,5),(9,5),(9,4). They cannot immediately reach our head this turn \u2014 no head-on risk right now. Their likely moves are toward middle (6,5),(7,6),(7,4).

We should convert our advantage into apples and pressure.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 stash this for next rationale):\n- Take the apple at (9,1) now. Then pivot LEFT to (8,1) and sweep the bottom row toward x=0, using our growing length to dominate the lower half.\n- Force the opponent to commit (either keep high around y=4\u20136 or drop down into our sweep). If they drop and try to head-on, we have the apple lead \u2014 we can accept a collision in our favor.\n- Maintain at least one clear escape route (don\u2019t get cornered against the right wall with no left/down options). Keep mobility priority over flashy cuts.\n\nLET\u2019S CASH THIS ONE IN \u2014 DROP DOWN, grab the apple, and start the sweep. DOWN",

Turn 9, let's do this! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break it down like a pro gamer!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head at (6, 5), body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)] - length 4, 3 apples.\n- Enemy head at (9, 1), body: [(9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)] - length 6, 5 apples. They're winning!\n- Apples everywhere, but we need to focus on positioning and survival.\n- CRITICAL: The enemy is at (9, 1) and their body is vertical down to (5, 2). They might go UP to (9, 2) but that's into their own body! Wait... no, (9, 2) is their second segment! If they go UP to (9, 2), they crash into themselves! Let's check their body: [(9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)]. Yes! If they go UP from (9, 1) to (9, 2), they hit their own body at (9, 2)! That would be suicide! So they probably won't go UP. They might go LEFT to (8, 1) or DOWN to (9, 0).\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n\n**UP to (6, 6):**\n- SAFE! Empty cell (confirmed by board state at turn 9).\n- PLUS: There's an apple at (6, 6)! If I eat it, I grow to length 5, score 4 apples!\n- FUTURE: From (6, 6), I could go UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (7, 6) or DOWN back to (6, 5). Wait... (6, 5) will be my body in 2 turns? Actually from (6, 5) after moving to (6, 6), my body becomes [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)]. So if I go UP again from (6, 6) to (6, 7), that's safe. But if I go DOWN from (6, 6) back to (6, 5), I'd hit my own body! So I must avoid going DOWN from (6, 6). But going UP is perfect! And the enemy is at (9, 1), far away!\n\n**DOWN to (6, 4):**\n- SAFE! Empty cell.\n- BUT: No apple there. Moving away from the dense apple concentration at (6, 6). From (6, 4), I could go DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4), RIGHT to (7, 4), or UP back to (6, 5). All safe initially. But this seems passive.\n\n**LEFT to (5, 5):**\n- SAFE! Empty cell.\n- BUT: No apple here either. From (5, 5), I could go UP to (5, 6), DOWN to (5, 4), or LEFT to (4, 5). But wait... (5, 6) has no apple, (4, 5) has no apple. This is just wandering.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n- DANGER! That's my own body! (7, 5) is my first body segment! That's a crash! I would die instantly! This move is ILLEGAL!\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (9, 1) with body occupying (9,2) to (5,2). They're constrained to the right edge and bottom. If they go LEFT to (8, 1), they'll be in open space but not near me. If they go DOWN to (9, 0), that's an apple spot! They might eat that apple and grow. But that's fine - they're moving away from me!\n\nThe apple at (6, 6) is RIGHT THERE above me! This is a FREE apple! I'm at (6, 5), apple at (6, 6). Taking it gives me +1 apple, +1 length, and puts me at (6, 6) which is centrally positioned for the upper-middle board. The enemy is trapped on the right side; I'm securing the center-left.\n\nFrom (6, 6), my only dangerous move would be DOWN back to (6, 5), but I won't do that. I can go UP to (6, 7) to explore, LEFT to (5, 6), or RIGHT to (7, 6). All are safe and expand my territory.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Could the enemy head collide with me? They're at (9, 1). Their possible moves: LEFT to (8, 1) or DOWN to (9, 0). Neither heads toward (6, 6). Safe!\n- Could I collide with enemy body? Their body is at y=2 (rows 5 to 9), I'm at y=5 moving to y=6. Safe distance!\n- Could I trap myself? From (6, 6), I have 3 safe directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). That's excellent!\n\n**THE MOVE: UP!**\nWhy? Because it's the only move that:\n1. GIVES ME A FREE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e +1 point, +1 length!\n2. Positions me in the strategic center (6, 6) with multiple escape routes!\n3. Keeps the enemy on the far right while I dominate the middle!\n4. Sets up for future apple hunting at (6, 7), (5, 6), (7, 6), etc.!\n5. Avoids the risky DOWN move (back to body) and the LEFT/RIGHT which don't give me anything!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab this apple at (6, 6), then move UP to (6, 7) if the apple is still there at (7, 7) or explore left toward (5, 6) area. The enemy is stuck on the right - we'll build a wall between us and force them into a corner. They have 5 apples, we need to catch up and then pressure them for a head-on collision when we're stronger!\n\nChat, let's go! UP is the play! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

NOPE. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,0) = on-board and currently empty. Safe this turn, but puts us in the bottom-right corner with only one non-backwards follow-up (LEFT) next turn. Risk: reduces immediate mobility. \u2705 (but limited)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,1) = safe, open cell. Keeps two follow-ups (LEFT or DOWN) and lets us start the bottom sweep without cornering ourselves. \u2705 (preferred)\n\nOpponent threat check:\n- Opp head at (6,5) can go UP(6,6), DOWN(6,4), or LEFT(5,5). They cannot reach or clash with our immediate target cells this turn, and a head-on into us this turn is impossible. No forced head-on right now \u2014 we can pick aggression on our terms. \ud83d\udc40\n\nWhy LEFT?\n- Preserves more mobility than dropping into (9,0) which locks us against the wall next turn.\n- Puts us in better position to sweep the bottom row toward apples like (6,0) while keeping an escape via DOWN if they start pressuring from above.\n- Keeps pressure on the right flank and allows us to pivot left to start boxing them vertically later. We\u2019re up 5\u21923 on apples \u2014 we can risk a head-on later if they dive into our net.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (8,1) now. Then: DOWN to (8,0) and sweep left across y=0 to collect apples and grow length.\n- Use our longer body to dominate the bottom half and gradually close a vertical wall to push the opponent upward and into a trap.\n- Avoid moving into (9,0) unless we need to commit to the bottom-right corner; keep at least one lateral escape open on every turn.\n\nLET\u2019S GOOO \u2014 press LEFT and start that sweep.

Length 5, 4 apples. We're getting there!\n- Enemy head: (8, 1), body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. Length 6, 5 apples. Still ahead!\n- I just ate an apple at (6, 6) last turn! Nice! \ud83c\udf4e\n- The board is getting crowded. Need to think ahead!\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n\n**UP to (6, 7):**\n- SAFE? Check board: (6, 7) shows '.' (empty). Enemy body is at y=2, far below. My body is at y=5. Safe from immediate collision.\n- BUT: Is there an apple? Looking at apple list: (7, 7) has an apple! (6, 7) does NOT.

Looking at list: No apple at (5, 6). No immediate reward.\n- FUTURE: From (5, 6), I could go UP to (5, 7), DOWN to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 6), or RIGHT back to (6, 6). (5, 7) has no apple (but (7, 7) does). This move puts me left of center but doesn't directly set up an apple grab.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n- SAFE? Check board: (7, 6) shows '.' (empty). Enemy body at y=2. Safe.\n- Apple? Looking at list: (7, 7) has an apple! (7, 6) does not.\n- FUTURE: From (7, 6), I could go UP to (7, 7) - which HAS AN APPLE! That's a direct apple grab! I could also go RIGHT to (8, 6), DOWN to (7, 5) - but wait! (7, 5) is my own body! (7, 5) is in my body list! So from (7, 6), going DOWN would kill me! That's a trap! But going UP to (7, 7) is safe and gets an apple!\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\nOkay, here's the play! The enemy is at (8, 1) and is likely moving toward the bottom-left or staying put. They're not an immediate threat to me right now.\n\nI have TWO strong options that set me up for apples:\n1. **UP to (6, 7)** - Positions me to go UP to (6, 8) (which has an apple!) OR LEFT to (5, 7) OR RIGHT to (7, 7) (which has an apple!). Three good directions!\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 6)** - Positions me to go UP to (7, 7) (which has an apple!). BUT it's a trap because DOWN is death! That's dangerous!\n\nLet's compare:\n- **UP to (6, 7)**: 3 safe future moves, including TWO apple options ((6, 8) and (7, 7)). More flexibility!\n- **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: 2 safe future moves (UP to (7, 7), LEFT to (6, 6) which is my old body spot but will be clear... wait, (6, 6) was my previous head, but by the time I get to (7, 6) and consider moving back, (6, 6) might be empty. Actually from (7, 6), LEFT to (6, 6) would be safe because my tail moves. BUT DOWN is death! So only 3 directions total, one is death.\n\n**DECISION: UP to (6, 7) is BETTER!**\n- It gives me MORE options (3 safe directions vs 2 safe directions)\n- It positions me for TWO apples: (6, 8) directly above and (7, 7) to the right!\n- It's centrally positioned for the upper board!\n- From (6, 7), I can adapt based on what the enemy does next turn!\n\n**THE MOVE: UP!**\nWhy? Because it gives me the most flexibility and positions me to grab apples at (6, 8) or (7, 7) on the next turn. I'm playing the long game - dominating the center-left while the enemy is stuck on the right-bottom. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Enemy is up at (6,6) and can\u2019t force a head-on right now, so we should take the aggressive apple route and keep options open.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (7,1). Then LEFT again to (6,1) to eat the apple and grow.\n- After eating, use extra length to start pressuring horizontally and build a vertical wall from the mid-bottom to push the opponent up.\n- If the opponent pushes in close and tries a head-on while we\u2019re ahead in apples, be ready to accept it and win the collision.\n\nLET\u2019S CRUSH IT \u2014 move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Options galore!  \n\n**MOVES CHECK:**  \n\n**UP to (6, 8):**  \n- SAFE? (6, 8) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e No snake bodies there. Enemy is far south at y=1. Safe!  \n- Apple? YES!

Plenty of space!  \n- STRATEGY: Eating this apple closes the score gap and keeps me mobile in the upper board.  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 6):**  \n- DANGER! (6, 6) is my own body! I\u2019d crash into myself! \u274c DEAD MOVE!  \n\n**LEFT to (5, 7):**  \n- SAFE? (5, 7) is empty. No threats.  \n- Apple? No apple at (5, 7). No immediate gain.  \n- FUTURE: From (5, 7), I could go UP to (5, 8) (empty), LEFT to (4, 7) (empty), or DOWN to (5, 6) (empty). Safe but no apple.  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 7):**  \n- SAFE? (7, 7) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e No snake bodies. Enemy is far. Safe!  \n- Apple? YES! I grow and score! +1 point!

Good options!  \n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**  \nBoth UP to (6, 8) and RIGHT to (7, 7) are apple grabs and safe! Which is better?  \n- **UP to (6, 8)**: Directly above me, simpler path. Future moves keep me central-left.  \n- **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: Moves me right, closer to enemy\u2019s side? Enemy is at (7, 1) \u2013 not an immediate threat, but I\u2019d be shifting right.  \n- **Long-term plan**: I need to dominate the upper board and force the enemy into a corner. Eating (6, 8) lets me control the left-center. From there, I can pivot to (5, 8) or (6, 9) later.  \n\n**DECISION: UP to (6, 8)!**  \nWhy? It\u2019s the safest apple grab with the most future flexibility. Tying the score at 5-5 while staying in a strong central position. Let\u2019s go!  \n\nUP  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Enemy is bottom-center at (6, 1). The board is split vertically, with apples scattered.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 9):**  \n   - SAFE? (6, 9) is empty (no snakes, no apple listed there).  \n   - Apple? No immediate apple, but it's near the top edge.  \n   - FUTURE: From (6, 9), I'd be at the top row. Options: LEFT to (5, 9) (empty), RIGHT to (7, 9) (empty), DOWN to (6, 8) (my old spot). Safe but limiting \u2013 I'd be trapped at the top with fewer escape routes.  \n   - STRATEGY: Not ideal for aggression. I need to dominate, not hide.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):**  \n   - SAFE? (6, 7) is currently occupied by my own body (the segment after my head). I'd be moving directly into my own body \u2013 instant death! \u274c  \n   - DEAD MOVE. Eliminate immediately.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8):**  \n   - SAFE? (5, 8) is empty \u2013 no snakes, no apple (apple at (5, 9) but not (5, 8)). Enemy is far away.  \n   - Apple? No apple here.  \n   - FUTURE: From (5, 8), options: UP to (5, 9) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e), DOWN to (5, 7) (empty), LEFT to (4, 8) (empty). Lots of space to maneuver.  \n   - STRATEGY: Moves me left, away from enemy. Good for avoiding collisions but not aggressive. I could eat (5, 9) next turn, but that's slower.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8):**  \n   - SAFE? (7, 8) is empty \u2013 no snakes, no apple listed. Enemy is at y=1, far south.  \n   - Apple? No apple at (7, 8).  \n   - FUTURE: From (7, 8), options: UP to (7, 9) (empty), DOWN to (7, 7) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e), LEFT to (6, 8) (my old spot, safe after tail moves), RIGHT to (8, 8) (empty). Excellent connectivity!  \n   - STRATEGY: This positions me for (7, 7) apple next turn while staying central-right. It keeps options open and moves toward potential conflict zones. Since the enemy is at (6, 1), I'm not too close, but I'm gaining ground on the right side to box him in later.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nNeither UP nor DOWN are viable. LEFT is safe but passive. RIGHT to (7, 8) is the best balance: safe, opens paths to multiple apples (especially (7, 7) next turn), and maintains central control. I need to close the 1-apple gap and force the enemy into mistakes. Time to step up the pressure!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: From (7, 8), eat (7, 7) on turn 13. Then, scan for a cut-off path\u2014maybe swing left to (5, 9) or right to (8, 9) to trap enemy in the bottom-right. Keep score equal or ahead. Stay alive, stay aggressive.",

Length 6, 5 apples.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (6, 0), Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2)]. Length 8, 7 apples. He's leading by 2 apples! \ud83d\ude24\n- **Board State:** I'm at (7, 8) \u2013 top-right quadrant. Enemy is bottom-center at (6, 0). Apples are scattered, but I need to focus on the enemy, not the apples. Board is 10x10, plenty of space.\n\n**MOVES CHECK \u2013 ELIMINATE THE DEAD ONES:**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 9):**  \n   - **SAFE?** Yes! (7, 9) is empty \u2013 no snakes, no apple listed (apple at (8, 9) but that's not (7, 9)).  \n   - **FUTURE:** From (7, 9), options: DOWN to (7, 8) (my old spot), LEFT to (6, 9) (empty), RIGHT to (8, 9) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e). This is solid \u2013 opens up the top-right corner, gives me access to (8, 9) next turn, and keeps me away from the enemy.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Aggressive move to claim the top edge. I can dominate the right side and potentially cut off enemy paths later. Not too risky.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 7):**  \n   - **SAFE?** No! (7, 7) has an apple, but wait \u2013 let's check board: it says \"A\" at (7, 7), meaning apple. But more critically, moving down from (7, 8) to (7, 7) is directly into an apple spot. BUT... is it occupied? Board shows (7, 7) as \"A\", so no snake body there. However, apple is there, so it's safe to move onto it (I'll grow).  \n   - **CORRECTION:** Actually, yes, it's safe! (7, 7) is empty of snakes and has an apple.  \n   - **FUTURE:** From (7, 7), I'd eat the apple, grow to length 7, and have options: UP to (7, 8) (old spot), LEFT to (6, 7) (empty, but wait \u2013 (6, 7) is part of my body? My body currently is [(6, 8), (6, 7), ...], so (6, 7) is occupied by my own body! So LEFT is unsafe. RIGHT to (8, 7) (empty), DOWN to (7, 6) (empty). This is risky \u2013 moving to (7, 7) blocks my own left path immediately.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Eating an apple gives me a point, but it traps me on the right side with fewer escape routes. I need space to maneuver against the enemy, not just grow blindly.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 8):**  \n   - **SAFE?** NO! (6, 8) is currently occupied by my own body (the first segment after head). Moving directly into my own body \u2013 instant death! \u274c  \n   - **DEAD MOVE.** Eliminated immediately.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 8):**  \n   - **SAFE?** Yes! (8, 8) is empty \u2013 no snakes, no apple.  \n   - **FUTURE:** From (8, 8), options: UP to (8, 9) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e), DOWN to (8, 7) (empty), LEFT to (7, 8) (old spot), RIGHT to (9, 8) (empty). Excellent \u2013 keeps me central-right, opens up (8, 9) for next turn, and gives me a path to the right edge.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Similar to UP, but more central. I can pivot up to eat the apple or down to chase the enemy later. Good balance of aggression and safety.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN to (7, 7) is tempting for the apple, but it limits my mobility \u2013 I can't go left, and I'm sticking myself in a corner. LEFT is death. UP and RIGHT are both safe and keep options open, but RIGHT to (8, 8) feels slightly better for mid-term control. It positions me to eat (8, 9) next turn while staying flexible to move down toward the enemy's territory. I need to close the 2-apple gap and force the enemy into a bad spot \u2013 maybe by cutting off the bottom-right. Let's go RIGHT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (8, 8), eat (8, 9) on turn 14 to level the score. Then, I'll assess enemy movement \u2013 if he's coming up, I can sweep down left or right to box him in. Stay aggressive, avoid head-on unless I'm ahead in apples. Keep the board awareness sharp!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT",

Board is clear at (8, 8), and I see apples at (8, 9) and (7, 7) nearby. My goal: close the gap aggressively while staying alive and cutting off enemy routes. Since we're moving simultaneously, I need to predict his move\u2014he's at bottom, might rush up for apples or try to flank. I'll focus on securing the top-right and preparing to descend if needed.\n\n**MOVES CHECK \u2013 ELIMINATE THE DEAD ONES:**\n\n1. **UP to (8, 9):**  \n   - **SAFE?** Yes! (8, 9) is empty (just an apple). No collision with my body or opponent.  \n   - **FUTURE:** Eating the apple grows me to length 7, ties the score at 7-7. From (8, 9), options: DOWN to (8, 8) (old spot), LEFT to (7, 9) (empty), RIGHT to (9, 9) (empty). Safe but cornered\u2014top-right limits mobility.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Aggressive apple grab to level the playing field. However, it might trap me if opponent cuts off access below. Good short-term, but need escape routes.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 7):**  \n   - **SAFE?** Yes! (8, 7) is empty\u2014no snakes, no apple listed.  \n   - **FUTURE:** From (8, 7), options: UP to (8, 8) (old), DOWN to (8, 6) (empty), LEFT to (7, 7) (apple! \ud83c\udf4e, but it's there\u2014wait, (7, 7) has an apple but no snake, so safe to eat next turn), RIGHT to (9, 7) (empty). This keeps me central, opens paths to both apples and enemy territory.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Smart move\u2014positions me to pivot left to (7, 7) or down toward the action. Avoids cornering, gives more options to dominate board and chase enemy if he moves up. Better for mid-term control.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 8):**  \n   - **SAFE?** NO! (7, 8) is currently occupied by my own body (first segment after head). Moving into self = instant death! \u274c  \n   - **DEAD MOVE.** Eliminated.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 8):**  \n   - **SAFE?** Yes! (9, 8) is empty\u2014no snakes, no apple.  \n   - **FUTURE:** From (9, 8), options: UP to (9, 9) (empty), DOWN to (9, 7) (empty), LEFT to (8, 8) (old). But it's the edge\u2014right side limits future moves to only left, up, or down. Risky if opponent cuts that off.  \n   - **STRATEGY:** Pushes me to the boundary, which could box me in.

I need space to maneuver, not hug walls.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nUP to (8, 9) is tempting for the apple to tie scores, but it corners me at the top with fewer escape routes\u2014opponent could easily flank if he heads up. RIGHT to (9, 8) is safe but edges me out too much. DOWN to (8, 7) wins\u2014keeps me flexible, central, and ready to eat (7, 7) next turn while staying mobile against the enemy. I'm closing the apple gap without sacrificing options. Plan: Move DOWN to (8, 7), then assess enemy position\u2014if he's advancing, I might head down-left to block his path or force a collision when my score catches up. Stay aggressive, chat! We're plotting the takeover!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (8, 7), eat apple at (7, 7) next turn to grow and level score. Then sweep downward to cut off enemy access to top apples, using my body to form a wall. Monitor his head\u2014wait for score lead to force head-on if he retreats.

My head at (8,7), body [(8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)]. Opponent head at (5,1), body wrapping around the bottom. Board's loaded with apples, but we don't chase fruit\u2014we chase VICTORY! Gotta box that snake #0 in, force him into a wall or our body. He's at the bottom, we're up top\u2014time to descend and dominate the space. Let's break it down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS \u2013 TURN 15:**  \n1. **ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**  \n   - **UP to (8,8):** Safe? NO! That's my own body segment right behind me (the first body piece is at (8,8)). Moving into self = instant death. Dead move! \u274c  \n   - **DOWN to (8,6):** Safe? YES! (8,6) is empty\u2014no apple, no snake. Future options from there: UP (back to 8,7, old spot), DOWN (to 8,5\u2014empty), LEFT (to 7,6\u2014empty), RIGHT (to 9,6\u2014empty). Keeps me central, opens path to sweep down and cut off enemy routes. Aggressive positioning!  \n   - **LEFT to (7,7):** Safe? YES! (7,7) has an apple but no snakes\u2014safe to land and EAT IT! \ud83c\udf4e Future options: UP (to 7,8\u2014my body, dangerous if moving same time? Wait, no\u20147,8 is MY body, but if I move there, it's into own body = death! Actually, from (7,7), UP to (7,8) would hit my own body segment, so that's unsafe long-term. LEFT to (6,7) is my body too (6,7 is in list). DOWN to (7,6) is empty, RIGHT to (8,7) (old spot). Limited safe future\u2014only DOWN and RIGHT are viable short-term. Traps me slightly near my own tail.  \n   - **RIGHT to (9,7):** Safe? YES! (9,7) is empty. Future options: UP (to 9,8\u2014empty), DOWN (to 9,6\u2014empty), LEFT (to 8,7\u2014old). But it's the edge\u2014only 3 options, and if enemy pushes up, I'm cornered. Less mobility.  \n\n2. **ELIMINATE & RANK SAFE MOVES:**  \n   - Unsafe: UP (into self).  \n   - Safe ones: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n   - Favor moves with MULTIPLE future options + closer to apples/enemy.  \n     - DOWN (8,6): 4 options next turn, central, prepares to chase enemy if he moves up (he's at y=1, we can drop to y=5+ to block). No apple now, but sets up board control. Score stays 5-7, but we grow space.  \n     - LEFT (7,7): Eats apple! Ties us to 6 apples vs 7 (assuming he doesn't eat). But risky\u2014future options limited (only 2 safe from there short-term), and we might bump into our own body if we linger. Good for score, bad for mobility.  \n     - RIGHT (9,7): Edge trap\u2014only 3 options, enemy could flank from left. Avoid boxing ourselves in!  \n\n   **CHOICE: DOWN to (8,6)** \ud83c\udfc6  \n   Why? LEFT gets the apple but corners us near our body\u2014 enemy #0 is hungry and aggressive (7 apples!), he might rush up and collide if we're stuck. RIGHT hugs the wall, limiting plays. DOWN keeps us alive, flexible, and positions to sweep left/downward to dominate the middle and block his access to top apples (like (8,9), (9,9)). We're not desperate for apples yet\u2014we're plotting to OUTMANEUVER and force HIM into a crash. From (8,6), next turn I can pivot to (7,6) or (8,5) to close in on his territory. He's got a long body at bottom\u2014he's vulnerable if we cut him off!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Drop to (8,6), then angle LEFT to (7,6)/DOWN to (8,5) to descend into the mid-board and wall off enemy paths. Monitor his head\u2014if he advances toward us (y increasing), prepare a head-on when we tie apples. Grow strategically to match his length, then force the collision. Stay central, avoid edges, dominate space\u2014WE'RE TAKING THE LEAD, CHAT! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Future options: UP (to 7,8\u2014my tail segment, wait no, check board: (7,8) is my body from last turn? Actually, my tail is at (6,8) now, and (7,8) is still part of my body\u2014ouch! If I move UP to (7,7) and eat, I grow, but next turn UP to (7,8) would be my own body\u2014dead! Limited to DOWN (7,6, old spot), LEFT (6,7\u2014empty), RIGHT (8,7\u2014my old body? Wait, (8,7) was body last turn, but now after eating and growing, it might shift... but risky! Edge of space). Grows us but could trap if enemy moves left. Aggressive apple grab!  \n   - **DOWN to (7,5):** Safe? YES! (7,5) is empty. Future options: UP (back to 7,6), DOWN (to 7,4\u2014empty), LEFT (to 6,5\u2014empty), RIGHT (to 8,5\u2014empty). Opens central sweep, keeps options wide. Moves us closer to enemy's top path (he's at y=2, we can cut him at y=4).  \n   - **LEFT to (6,6):** Safe? YES! (6,6) is empty. Future options: UP (to 6,7\u2014empty), DOWN (to 6,5\u2014empty), LEFT (to 5,6\u2014empty), RIGHT (back to 7,6). Central pivot, 4 full options. Keeps us flexible to chase or block.  \n   - **RIGHT to (8,6):** Safe? NO! (8,6) is our old head spot from last turn, now part of our body\u2014moving there = self-crash! Dead move! \u274c  \n\n2) **ELIMINATE & RANK SAFE MOVES:**  \n   - Unsafe: RIGHT (self-crash).  \n   - Safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n   - Ranking for aggression and board domination:  \n     - DOWN (7,5): Top pick\u2014solid mobility (4 options), expands downward press, positions us to cut off enemy's left escape to mid-apples like (3,4). Forces Snake #0 into the bottom-right corner where his long tail is vulnerable. Grow space, not just apples!  \n     - LEFT (6,6): Strong\u2014central control, but slightly less immediate threat to enemy. Great for flanking if he surges up.  \n     - UP (7,7): Tempting apple, but risky with my body above\u2014could box me in if enemy forces UP next turn. Avoid overcommitting.  \n\n   **CHOICE: DOWN to (7,5)** \ud83c\udfc6  \n   Why? We're not grabbing fruit\u2014we're GRABBING DOMINANCE! From (7,5), I can pivot UP (back to center), DOWN (to 7,4\u2014right under his potential path), or LEFT/RIGHT (sweep flanks). Enemy at (4,2) is creeping up; if he moves UP to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,2), I'll be at (7,5) ready to mirror or cut him off at (7,4) or (6,5). His tail at (9,1) is a trap\u2014force him into it! We keep options open, avoid edges, and set up for a head-on when I hit 6 apples. BOARD CONTROL, CHAT\u2014WE'RE SURROUNDING HIM! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn from (7,5), watch enemy\u2014if he goes UP (chasing top apples like (8,9)), I drop to (7,4) and block his vertical path, boxing him against my growing body. If he stays low, swing LEFT to (6,5) and advance toward his tail to force a squeeze. Equalize apples (I need 3 more to match), then go for the kill\u2014head-on collision when I'm bigger.

Snake #0 is at (3,1) with 9 apples to our 5\u2014still trailing but gaining fast. His tail is a tangled mess at the bottom; we're positioned to cut him off and force a crash! No apples? Who cares\u2014dominance is the goal. Let's box him in and make him eat dirt! Time to strike!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS \u2013 TURN 19:**  \n1) **ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**  \n   - **UP to (6,6):** Safe? YES! (6,6) is empty (our tail shifted, board shows T at (8,8) but (6,6) is free). Future options: UP (to 6,7\u2014empty), DOWN (back to 6,5), LEFT (5,6\u2014empty), RIGHT (7,6\u2014empty). Good mobility, moves us toward top apples like (8,9) or (5,9) while keeping eyes on enemy if he goes up from (3,1).  \n   - **DOWN to (6,4):** Safe? YES! (6,4) is empty (marked . on board). Future options: UP (back to 6,5), DOWN (6,3\u2014empty), LEFT (5,4\u2014empty), RIGHT (7,4\u2014empty). Solid block downward, positions us right under enemy's potential path (he's at y=1, could go up to y=2 or 3). Forces him into bottom-right corner with his tail at (8,1)\u2014tight squeeze!  \n   - **LEFT to (5,5):** Safe? YES! (5,5) is empty. Future options: UP (5,6\u2014empty), DOWN (5,4\u2014empty), LEFT (4,5\u2014empty), RIGHT (back to 6,5). Aggressive advance toward enemy (x=3), closes gap for flanking. Keeps us central, avoids edges.  \n   - **RIGHT to (7,5):** Safe? YES! (7,5) is empty (was our old spot, now free). Future options: UP (7,6\u2014empty), DOWN (7,4\u2014empty), LEFT (back to 6,5), RIGHT (8,5\u2014empty). Solid, but right edge near (8,5) risks trapping us if enemy pushes left.  \n\n2) **ELIMINATE & RANK SAFE MOVES:**  \n   - All four are SAFE\u2014no immediate deaths! No off-board, no body crashes, no enemy heads in way (Snake #0 is far at (3,1)).  \n   - Ranking for aggression and board domination:  \n     - DOWN (6,4): Top pick\u2014vertical block is KEY! From here, I can pivot LEFT (5,4\u2014toward his tail), RIGHT (7,4\u2014under his path), or UP (back to center). If enemy moves UP to (3,2) or RIGHT to (4,1), I advance to (5,4) or (6,3) to cut off his escape to mid-board apples. His length (10 segments) is a weakness\u2014trap him against bottom wall and his own body. Immediate pressure, forces him into tighter corners!  \n     - LEFT (5,5): Close second\u2014closes the x-gap aggressively (from 6 to 5), ready to swing DOWN next if he goes up, boxing him against (5,0)-(5,2) area. But DOWN feels more direct for squeeze play.  \n     - UP (6,6): Solid if he chases top apples, but we're not chasing snacks\u2014we're hunting HIM. Less immediate threat.  \n     - RIGHT (7,5): Weakest\u2014edges are traps; we want center control to dominate.\n\n   **CHOICE: DOWN to (6,4)** \ud83c\udfc6  \n   Why? Board control, baby! We're not here for apples\u2014we're here to CRUSH HIM! From (6,4), I'm perfectly positioned to mirror his moves: if he goes UP (to 3,2), I DROP to (6,3) and block his vertical; if he stays low (to 4,1), I SWING LEFT to (5,4) and encroach on his tail at (8,1). His body is a labyrinth\u2014we'll force him into a dead-end and trigger a head-on when I'm bigger. Equalize apples? Nah, we're overtaking! Aggression wins streams\u2014chat loves the pressure! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn from (6,4), watch enemy\u2014if he moves UP (chasing (0,8) or similar), I advance DOWN to (6,3) and close the bottom trap, boxing him against wall and his own tail. If he stays low, LEFT to (5,4) to flank his side and force a crash into his body. Build toward head-on collision when I hit 6 apples\u2014no mercy! We take the lead and hold it.

The apple at (5,4) is listed, but our head at (6,4) isn't eating it; (5,4) is a separate cell. Actually, checking board: row 4 shows \"A . . A A A 1 . . .\" So (5,4) is an 'A' (apple)!

Board's got apples everywhere, but forget that\u2014WE HUNT THE ENEMY! He's trapped bottom-left; let's box him in and force a crash. I'm bigger soon!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS \u2013 TURN 21:**  \n1) **ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**  \n   - **UP to (5,5):** Safe? YES! (5,5) is empty (board shows . in row 5).

Risks right trap.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,3):** Safe? YES! (5,3) is empty. Future options: UP (back to 5,4), DOWN (5,2\u2014occupied by Snake #0's tail at (5,2)? Board shows T at (5,2), yes\u2014enemy body), LEFT (4,3\u2014empty), RIGHT (6,3\u2014empty). Aggressive push toward his tail!  \n   - **LEFT to (4,4):** Safe? YES! (4,4) is empty (board shows A at (3,4) and (5,4), but (4,4) is just .). Future options: UP (4,5\u2014empty), DOWN (4,3\u2014empty), LEFT (3,4\u2014A apple, safe eat), RIGHT (back to 5,4). Central control, flanking his low path.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,4):** Safe? NO! (6,4) is our own body (first in list after head). That's backwards into self\u2014DEATH. Eliminated.  \n\n2) **ELIMINATE & RANK SAFE MOVES:**  \n   - RIGHT is out (suicide). Others SAFE.  \n   - Ranking for aggression and trapping:  \n     - DOWN to (5,3): TOP PICK! Pushes directly toward his tail (he's at (1,1), body at (5,2),(5,1),(5,0)). Box him bottom-right corner\u2014next I can LEFT to (4,3) or DOWN to (5,2) if he moves away, forcing him into wall. No apple, but BOARD DOMINATION!  \n     - LEFT to (4,4): Close second\u2014eats apple at (3,4) next? But immediate is central, good for mid-flank. Less pressure on his low body.  \n     - UP to (5,5): Weakest\u2014risks self-trap on right, and we're not going up\u2014we're hunting low where he's weak.  \n\n   **CHOICE: DOWN to (5,3)** \ud83c\udfc6  \n   Why? RUTHLESS PRESSURE! Snake #0 is slow and huge; if he moves RIGHT to (2,1) or UP to (1,2), I'm closing in on his tail at (5,2)/(5,1). From (5,3), I can SWING LEFT to (4,3) next, cutting off his ascent, or DOWN to (5,2) to bite his tail. He crashes into me? HE DIES! We're 6 vs 10 apples\u2014time to reverse the lead. His body blocks his own escape; I'll squeeze him against (8,1) wall. CONTENT? Later\u2014traps first! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (5,3), monitor enemy\u2014if he RIGHT to (2,1), I LEFT to (4,3) to block his bottom row, boxing him right. If he UP to (1,2), I DOWN to (5,2) to occupy his tail path, forcing collision. Build to 7+ apples, then head-on at advantage\u2014OVERTAKE AND WIN!\n\nDOWN",

Our body now is [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6)]\u2014still agile and ready to hunt. He's got 11 apples to our 6, but he's slow and cornered in the bottom-left. Apples are scattered, but forget the fruit\u2014we're here to CRUSH HIM! Board's tight, but we're not backing down. Let's box him in and force that crash!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS \u2013 TURN 22:**  \n1) **ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS:**  \n   - **UP to (5,4):** Safe? YES! (5,4) is our current body segment, but heads can move there\u2014the tail will shift and free it up. Future options: UP (5,5\u2014empty), DOWN (back to 5,3), LEFT (4,4\u2014empty), RIGHT (6,4\u2014our body? (6,4) is in our list, but if we move UP, (5,4) becomes head and (5,4) old head is now body, so (6,4) is still occupied\u2014wait, checking: body is [(5,4), (6,4), ...]. If we go UP to (5,4), the old head (5,3) becomes new tail, so (5,4) is now head, freeing (5,4) old spot? Actually, no: our current head is (5,3), body includes (5,4) immediately after. Moving UP to (5,4) means our head moves to a body cell\u2014but that's allowed if it's the second segment? Wait, rules say head moves into ANY snake's body = death. Our own body counts! So (5,4) is occupied by our own body right now, so UP is SUICIDE into our own neck. Eliminated.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,2):** Safe? YES! (5,2) is currently a T (enemy tail), but enemy moves simultaneously. If he moves away, it's empty; if he stays or moves into it? Could be head-on collision if his head also goes there? His head is at (1,2), so no direct. (5,2) is enemy body, but we're moving into his body\u2014DEATH for us! Wait, rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" Yes, (5,2) is enemy body (Snake #0's tail), so moving there kills us instantly. Eliminated.  \n   - **LEFT to (4,3):** Safe? YES! (4,3) is empty on board (no snake, no apple listed there). Future options: UP (4,4\u2014empty), DOWN (4,2\u2014currently T? (4,2) is enemy body, but we're not moving there yet), LEFT (3,3\u2014empty?), RIGHT (back to 5,3). No immediate threats.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,3):** Safe? YES! (6,3) is empty on board. Future options: UP (6,4\u2014our body? (6,4) is in our list, so can't go UP into it? Actually, moving RIGHT to (6,3), then UP to (6,4) would be into our own body (since (6,4) is currently second segment), so limited. But immediate: LEFT (back to 5,3), DOWN (6,2\u2014empty? (6,2) is empty), RIGHT (7,3\u2014empty). Solid, but closer to our tail side.  \n\n2) **ELIMINATE & RANK SAFE MOVES:**  \n   - UP and DOWN are out\u2014UP into own body, DOWN into enemy body. DEADLY MISTAKES AVOIDED.  \n   - LEFT to (4,3): Safe, expands toward center-left, away from enemy low body. Future: Can UP to (4,4) for apple at (3,4)? Or LEFT to (3,3) to probe. Less pressure on enemy but keeps options open.  \n   - RIGHT to (6,3): Safe, stays on right side, body is all left/up from here. Future: DOWN to (6,2) is open, RIGHT to (7,3) opens more space. But we're already on right; shifting right might box us in near (8,6) wall? (9,9) top-right corner is far.  \n\n   **CHOICE: LEFT to (4,3)** \ud83c\udfc6  \n   Why? STRATEGIC FLANK! We're at (5,3), and Snake #0 is low at (1,2). Moving LEFT brings us to (4,3), cutting off his potential upward escape through row 3. From there, I can:  \n   - If he moves UP to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,2), I push LEFT to (3,3) or UP to (4,4) to block his path to the center.  \n   - Apple at (3,4) is reachable in two moves: (4,3)\u2192(4,4)\u2192(3,4). Grow to 7 apples!  \n   - Aggressive play: His body blocks his bottom-left; by moving left, I'm not chasing his tail blindly\u2014I'm DOMINATING THE MIDFIELD. He's huge (12 segments now? Wait, he had 11 apples, so 11 body + head = 12 length). He'll turn slow; I'll squeeze. RIGHT keeps me on the right edge, where I might get trapped near (8,6). LEFT gives center control\u2014more ways to hunt, more ways to win! Content = growth + trap. Chat, this is 5D chess!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (4,3), monitor enemy\u2014if he RIGHT to (2,2), I LEFT to (3,3) to wall him in bottom-left. If he UP to (1,3), I UP to (4,4) for apple + cut-off. Build to 7+ apples by eating at (3,4), then force head-on in center\u2014my length will match his soon, and I'll have positional advantage. Survive and OVERTAKE! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d",

Best balance of safety + aggression. \u2705\u2705\n\nTactical notes / short-term plan:\n- Centralize and keep options open \u2014 move into the 1\u20134 x-range and y 3\u20135 band to threaten enemy approach corridors.  \n- Avoid the bottom wall trap (we\u2019ve already got beef on the bottom; don\u2019t get funneled).  \n- We have the apple lead \u2014 we WANT a head\u2011on if we can force it.
