            "rationale": "Rationale: The closest apple is at (9, 1). However, moving directly DOWN is impossible as it would collide with the snake's body at (9, 2). The strategy is to path around the body to reach the apple at (9, 1). Moving LEFT to (8, 3) is the first step in a path (9,3) -> (8,3) -> (8,2) -> (8,1) -> (9,1) which safely avoids the growing body and leads to the apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue pathing towards the apple at (9,1) by moving DOWN to (8,2).\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
