LEFT keeps pressing toward the western apples but doesn’t make progress toward the nearest apple cluster beyond the one I just ate. DOWN heads toward open space but steers away from the apples. UP takes me closer to the cluster around (4,7) and (3,9), keeps multiple follow-up moves available, and stays well clear of Snake #0’s area. With no immediate threats nearby and a clear path northward, UP seems like the move that best balances safety and apple pursuit.\n\nPlan: Continue moving north into the upper half, then head west along the Y=7/8 band to sweep the remaining western apples while avoiding encroaching on Snake #0’s column.\n\nUP",

DOWN is legal but takes me away from the cluster of available apples near the top right and squeezes me against my own body segment around (3,6)–(3,4), which limits future maneuverability. LEFT keeps me near my current region but doesn’t make progress toward the remaining apples, and it risks dragging me into the cramped area I just left. UP to (2,8) is safe, keeps me near open space along the top edge, and positions me to reach the apples clustered at y=8–9 (especially (3,9)) while avoiding my own body. No opponent head is nearby, so head-on collision risk is minimal.\n\nPlan: Head up to row 8, then work my way over to (3,9) and continue sweeping eastward along the top to grab the nearby apples without letting my body box me in.\n\nUP",

The only remaining legal square is down into (7,5); I’m aware it’s currently part of their body, but they are completely boxed in and any shift of their segments still tends to leave rooms in front of them, so moving down is the only way to keep the fight alive and pry open the southern corridor.\n\nPlan: After sliding down to (7,5), I’ll keep an eye on Snake #0’s forced movements to see if I can swing west along row 5/4 once they commit, then work my way toward the lower-left apples if the corridor frees up.\n\nDOWN",
