It moves me closer to (1, 8) more efficiently\n2. The enemy head at (1, 7) is one space away vertically - if it moves UP to (1, 8), I won't collide on this turn at (3, 7)\n3. From (3, 7), I have clear paths to (1, 8) and other apples\n4. This keeps my options open while making progress toward a nearby apple\n\n**Long-term plan for next 5 turns:**\n- Turn 9: Move UP to (3, 7) - get closer to (1, 8)\n- Turn 10: Move LEFT to pursue (1, 8) if safe\n- Monitor enemy snake's position relative to apples\n- Target (1, 8) as priority, then (6, 7)\n- Stay aware that enemy is also competing for apples\n\nUP",

According to the rules: \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n\nSince I have 12 apples and the enemy has 10 apples, this guarantees me an immediate WIN. This is the optimal outcome - a guaranteed victory on this turn.\n\nThere's no reason to continue playing conservatively when I can secure the win right now. The collision is certain, and I have the higher apple count needed to win the tiebreaker.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** This move wins the game immediately via head-on collision with apple count tiebreaker (12 vs 10).\n\nUP",

After any enemy move the segment that was at (4,\u202f7) will occupy (5,\u202f7), so moving there would collide with an enemy body segment \u2192 death.\n\n- **Remaining safe options**: UP \u2192 (5,\u202f9) and RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f8).\n\n- **Proximity to apples** \u2013 Both moves bring the head one step closer to the nearest apple at (6,\u202f9).  \n  *UP* puts the head on the top row (y\u202f=\u202f9), limiting future upward movement and squeezing the snake against the edge.  \n  *RIGHT* moves the head to (6,\u202f8), staying inside the board, keeping the ability to move in all three remaining directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) and maintaining flexibility to chase other apples later.\n\n- **Collision risk with enemy** \u2013 The enemy\u2019s possible new head positions are (5,\u202f8), (5,\u202f6) or (6,\u202f7). Neither of those is (6,\u202f8), so moving RIGHT avoids any head\u2011on collision. Moving UP also avoids collision, but the resulting position on the edge reduces future options.\n\n- **Overall preference** \u2013 RIGHT gives us a safe, interior position, keeps multiple future directions open, and brings us directly adjacent to the reachable apple at (6,\u202f9) while staying clear of enemy movements.\n\n**Plan**  \nMove RIGHT to stay flexible, stay away from the top edge, and head toward the (6,\u202f9) apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nRIGHT",
