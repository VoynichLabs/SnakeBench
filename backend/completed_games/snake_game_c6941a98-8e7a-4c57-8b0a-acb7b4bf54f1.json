Let's set the tone early.\n\n**My head:** (4,3)  \n**Enemy head:** (0,2)  \nApples everywhere, but we ignore apples for now \u2014 we're hunting the enemy! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,2) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,3) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,3) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n\nAll moves safe right now. No body segments yet.\n\nNow, think about enemy movement. Enemy at (0,2) \u2014 likely will move right or up/down to avoid wall. If they go RIGHT \u2192 (1,2). Could they go UP to (0,3)? That\u2019s an apple, tempting. If they go UP, they\u2019ll be at (0,3) next turn.\n\nWe want to **cut off their space** and force them toward walls or into us when we have advantage. Right now equal score (0-0), so head-on collision kills both \u2014 avoid that unless we grow first.\n\nBut long-term: we need to **dominate center**, push them to edge. Our position (4,3) is strong central. Theirs (0,2) is west edge.\n\nIf we go RIGHT \u2192 (5,3), we move toward east side apples but also away from enemy. If we go LEFT \u2192 (3,3), closer to enemy but still safe distance. UP \u2192 (4,4) central but maybe too passive. DOWN \u2192 (4,2) puts us closer in y to enemy (they\u2019re at y=2).\n\nActually, enemy at y=2, we at y=3. If we go DOWN to (4,2), same y as them, x=4 vs x=0. Still far apart. But maybe we go DOWN then next turn move left to start boxing.\n\nBetter plan: **Start moving left to cut off the board** and pressure enemy early. Force them north or south into walls while we control center.\n\nSo LEFT to (3,3) feels aggressive but not reckless. Keeps options open: from (3,3) we can go up/down/left next turn.\n\n**Next turn plan:** If enemy moves toward center, we can intercept or avoid depending on length. If they stay west, we keep claiming center and middle-left.\n\nLet\u2019s go LEFT and start the squeeze! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

That means their body is now 2 segments long (head at (0,3), tail at (0,2)). We\u2019re still just a head at (3,3).  \n\nWe need to be careful \u2014 they\u2019re longer, so head-on collision kills us but not them (since they have more apples). We can\u2019t take that risk yet. Gotta grow first!  \n\nLet\u2019s check moves from (3,3):  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,4) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,2) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,3) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nAll safe for now.  \n\nBut think about enemy movement \u2014 they\u2019re at (0,3) with body at (0,2). They can\u2019t go DOWN into their own tail (that\u2019s backwards into body = death). So their options: UP to (0,4), LEFT off board (no), RIGHT to (1,3).  \n\nThey\u2019ll probably go RIGHT to (1,3) to stay on board and move toward center/apples.  \n\nIf they go RIGHT to (1,3), and we go LEFT to (2,3), we\u2019d be adjacent horizontally next turn \u2014 dangerous if they keep coming right. But we\u2019d have equal length then? Wait, they have 1 apple, we have 0, so they\u2019re longer. So if heads collide next turn, we die, they survive. So we must avoid being in front of their path when they\u2019re longer.  \n\nBetter to go UP or DOWN to gain space, maybe grab an apple quickly. Look at apples: (7,2), (7,1), (5,2) are somewhat close.  \n\nActually, (5,5) is central \u2014 but ignore apples? No, we need to grow to match length so we can fight. So maybe go RIGHT toward (4,3) then next turn toward (5,3) and up toward (5,5).  \n\nBut going RIGHT to (4,3) keeps distance from enemy moving right to (1,3). That\u2019s safe.  \n\nLet\u2019s think 2 steps:  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,3), enemy to (1,3), we\u2019re 3 apart. Next turn we could go UP to (4,4) toward apple at (7,4) or (5,5).  \n\nIf we go UP now to (3,4), enemy to (1,3), we\u2019re farther apart.  \n\nI like UP \u2014 puts us in a stronger central high ground, opens more options, avoids early confrontation while we\u2019re shorter.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGrow to match length ASAP, then start cutting off enemy\u2019s board space. They\u2019re stuck on left edge \u2014 we can slowly push right and control center, then trap them against wall.  \n\nUP",

That means head-on collision right now = we die, they survive. So we gotta play smart and grow first.\n\nOur head is at (3,4). Enemy head at (1,3) with body at (0,3). They can\u2019t go left (off board) or down (into tail at (0,2)? Wait, tail is at (0,3)? Actually their body list says [(0,3)] \u2014 that\u2019s one segment behind head at (1,3), so tail is at (0,3). So they can\u2019t go left (into own body) or down? Let\u2019s check: from (1,3), down to (1,2) \u2014 that\u2019s empty. So their safe moves: UP to (1,4), RIGHT to (2,3), DOWN to (1,2). They\u2019ll probably move toward center/apples.\n\nNow our options from (3,4):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nAll safe immediately. But we gotta think about where the enemy might go and avoid being in front of them while they\u2019re longer.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (2,3), and we go LEFT to (2,4), we\u2019d be adjacent vertically \u2014 not a collision this turn, but next turn if they go UP to (2,4) and we go DOWN to (2,3)? That\u2019s a possible head-on next turn \u2014 risky. If they go UP to (1,4), and we go UP to (3,5), safe distance.\n\nWe need to grow ASAP. Apples nearby: (5,5), (7,4), (5,2), (7,2), (7,1). Ignoring apples isn\u2019t smart \u2014 we need length to fight!\n\nLet\u2019s think two steps:  \nIf we go UP to (3,5), that\u2019s moving toward center/top.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (4,4), that\u2019s moving toward apple at (5,5) maybe next turn.  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,3), that\u2019s moving toward apple at (5,2).  \n\nBut also, we want to control space and not get trapped. Enemy is on left side \u2014 if we move right, we claim more board.\n\nActually, UP feels good \u2014 it opens more options, keeps distance from enemy likely moving right/up. Then next turn we can go right toward apples or keep maneuvering.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGrow to match length \u2014 target apple at (5,5) or (7,4). Keep enemy on our left, use right side of board to loop and trap them against wall. Once we\u2019re equal or longer, go for the cut-off!\n\nUP",

Wait, their body list is [(1,3)] \u2014 that's one segment behind head at (2,3), so tail at (1,3). So their snake is length 2.)\n\n**Enemy's possible moves from (2,3):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,4) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,2) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,3) \u274c into own body\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,3) \u2705 empty\n\nSo they can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.

But we must think about SIMULTANEOUS movement \u2014 where could their head end up relative to us?\n\n**Risk of head-on collision this turn?**  \nIf we go LEFT to (2,5) and they go UP to (2,4) \u2192 no collision (different cells).  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,4) and they go RIGHT to (3,3) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,4) and they go UP to (2,4) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf we go LEFT to (2,5) and they go RIGHT to (3,3) \u2192 no collision.  \nActually, no direct overlap possible this turn because we're 2 cells apart.\n\n**But NEXT TURN risk?**  \nWe need to avoid being adjacent in a way that lets them move into us while they're longer.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,5):\n- They go UP to (2,4) \u2192 we're adjacent vertically. Next turn if they go UP to (2,5) and we go DOWN to (2,4) \u2192 head-on and we die (they're longer). Risky.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,4):\n- They go RIGHT to (3,3) \u2192 adjacent vertically. Next turn if they go UP to (3,4) and we go DOWN to (3,3) \u2192 head-on, we die. Risky.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,6):\n- Puts us farther from them, safe distance. They'd need two moves to reach us.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,5):\n- Also puts us farther, opens path to right-side apples (apple at (5,5) is close!).\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nWe need an apple FAST to match length. Closest apples: (5,5) is 2 steps right/down? Actually from (3,5) to (5,5) is 2 right, 0 vertical? Wait (5,5) is x=5, y=5. We're at (3,5). So it's 2 steps RIGHT. Apple at (7,4) is farther. Apple at (5,2) is down.  \nGoing RIGHT now gets us closer to (5,5). Going UP gets us away from apples short-term but maybe safer.\n\nBut safety first \u2014 enemy is below us, moving likely UP/RIGHT. If we go RIGHT to (4,5), we're moving parallel but away from their possible UP path.  \nIf we go UP to (3,6), we're moving away from apples but maybe into open space.\n\nActually, let's be AGGRESSIVE for content \u2014 go for the apple! RIGHT puts us on path to (5,5) and also keeps multiple options open (UP/DOWN/RIGHT next turn).  \nEnemy likely won't be at (4,5) this turn.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (4,5) is safe now, progresses toward apple, keeps distance from enemy's likely moves.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nOnce we eat apple and match length, we can start boxing them in \u2014 they're on left side near wall, we can try to push them against boundary. Use right side to grow, then come back left to cut off their escape.\n\nRIGHT",

Length 2. Apples: 1.\n\nWE'RE TIED IN LENGTH! That means a head-on collision is a DOUBLE KO \u2014 but if we die together, score tie means DRAW. We want a WIN, not a draw. So we can be more aggressive now, but still smart.\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES from (4,3):**\n- UP \u2192 (4,4) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3) \u274c own body\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) \u2705 empty\n\nSo they can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**OUR POSSIBLE MOVES from (5,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) \u274c OUR OWN BODY (that's our neck! Going left is BACKWARDS into ourselves \u2014 DEATH!)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) \u2705 empty\n\nLEFT IS SUICIDE! So only UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**SIMULTANEOUS COLLISION RISK:**\nWe need to check where enemy could go that would cause:\n1. Head-on (same cell)\n2. They move into our future head (swap heads) \u2014 that's also head-on? Wait, simultaneous move: if we go to cell X and they go to cell Y, no collision unless X = Y.\nBut also, if they move into our current head's cell (5,5) while we leave it? That's impossible unless we stay still (we can't). So only worry about same destination.\n\nCheck each of our safe moves:\n\n- **UP to (5,6):** Could enemy reach (5,6)? From (4,3), no \u2014 too far. Safe from head-on.\n- **DOWN to (5,4):** Could enemy reach (5,4)? From (4,3), they'd need to go RIGHT to (5,3) then UP to (5,4) \u2014 two moves away. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6,5):** Could enemy reach (6,5)? No, too far.\n\nSo all three safe moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\n**BUT \u2014 adjacency risk next turn?** If we move somewhere adjacent to where they move, next turn we could face head-on with equal length. That's risky if we don't want draw.\n\nLook at enemy's likely moves: They might go UP to (4,4) toward center/apples. Or RIGHT to (5,3). DOWN to (4,2) is away from apples.\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS:** Closest apples to us: (6,7), (7,6), (5,7) etc. To enemy: (5,2), (7,2), (7,1) etc.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to box them in! They're near bottom-left. We should move to control the right side and top, then squeeze them against wall. Since we're equal length, we can threaten head-on to force them into bad spots.\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (5,6):** Gets us closer to apples at (6,7),(5,7). Puts us at y=6, enemy likely at y=3 or 4. Good distance.\n- **DOWN (5,4):** Puts us closer to enemy (they might be at (4,4) or (5,3)). Riskier \u2014 could get into adjacent clash next turn. But also closer to apple at (5,2)? That's far.\n- **RIGHT (6,5):** Moves us right, away from enemy, toward right-side apples (7,6),(8,6). Expands our space.\n\n**SAFETY OF FOLLOW-UP MOVES:**\nFrom (5,6): Can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Check: LEFT is (4,6) \u2014 empty. Good options.\nFrom (6,5): Can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? LEFT is (5,5) \u2014 will be empty (our tail at (4,5) stays, head moves). Actually our tail stays at (4,5) this turn, so (5,5) becomes empty. So LEFT is safe. Good options.\nFrom (5,4): Can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? LEFT is (4,4) \u2014 possible enemy there this turn? If enemy goes UP to (4,4), then next turn (4,4) has enemy body. So moving LEFT next turn could be dangerous. Riskier.\n\n**DECISION:** Want to avoid early draw, want to grow and control. UP gets us toward apples and keeps distance. RIGHT also good but maybe less direct toward apples? Actually UP is closer to several apples.\n\nLet's check apple (5,7) \u2014 from (5,6) we can go UP next turn to get it. That's growth!\n\n**FINAL PICK:** UP to (5,6) \u2014 safe, progresses toward apples, keeps options open, avoids premature clash.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** After moving UP, assess enemy position. If they moved UP to (4,4), we're at (5,6) \u2014 still safe distance. Then maybe go RIGHT to (6,6) or UP to (5,7) for apple. Start encircling from top-right.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- LEFT to (4,6): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n\nAll clear for immediate collision.\n\n**BUT \u2014 FUTURE POSITIONING & APPLE GRABS:**\nApple at (5,7) is RIGHT ABOVE US! If we go UP, we EAT IT, grow to length 3, and get score advantage! That's HUGE \u2014 with length 3 vs their length 2, a head-on collision next turn would KILL THEM and we survive! That changes the aggression calculus completely.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,6) or RIGHT to (6,6), we miss the apple, stay length 2, and they might grab (5,2) or another apple and tie or pass us.\n\n**POTENTIAL TRAPS?** Going UP to (5,7) eats apple, but then our body becomes [(5,6),(5,5)]. Next turn from (5,7) we'll have options: UP to (5,8) (apple there!), DOWN to (5,6) (our own body \u2014 would be unsafe unless tail moves), LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7) (apple!). Actually, after eating, our tail stays at (5,5) until we move again, so DOWN to (5,6) would be into our own body next turn \u2014 so DOWN would be blocked. But UP/LEFT/RIGHT likely open.\n\n**ENEMY LIKELY MOVES:** They might go DOWN to (5,2) for that apple, or UP to (5,4) toward center. If they go DOWN, distance increases. If they go UP, they're at (5,4) \u2014 we're at (5,7) \u2014 still safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** EAT THE APPLE NOW! Get length advantage, then use that to pressure them. With length 3 vs 2, we can threaten head-on collisions to force them into walls or themselves. We can start boxing them from above since they're in lower half.\n\n**MOVE CHOICE:**\n- UP: EAT APPLE, grow, gain score lead, safer aggression next turn.\n- LEFT/RIGHT: Miss apple, stay equal, less threatening.\n\nNO BRAINER CHAT! WE TAKE THE CONTENT AND THE POWER SPIKE! UP UP UP!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** After eating apple at (5,7), we'll be length 3. Check enemy position. If they're close, consider threatening head-on (since we win collision). If not, go for another apple (maybe (5,8) or (6,7)) to extend lead and control board.\n\nUP",

Apples: 1.\n\nHUGE! We have a 3 vs 2 length lead! That means if we go head-on collision, WE WIN AND THEY DIE! That's our weapon now! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK (OUR MOVES FROM (5,7)):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,8) \u2705 empty (apple at (5,8)! MORE CONTENT!)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6) \u274c OUR OWN BODY (that's our neck! INSTANT DEATH!)\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) \u2705 empty (apple at (6,7)!

Safe.\n- LEFT to (4,7): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n\nAll clear for immediate collision this turn.\n\n**BUT \u2014 STRATEGIC AGGRESSION TIME!** We have length advantage! We want to pressure them, cut off their space, and force a mistake or a losing head-on! Look at the board \u2014 they're at (6,3) in the lower middle. We're at (5,7) upper middle. We can start moving down to box them in from above! But first... APPLES! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe have TWO apples adjacent! (5,8) above and (6,7) to the right. Eating either grows us to length 4, extending our lead! Which one is better?\n\n**APPLE CHOICE:**\n- UP to (5,8): Puts us near top edge (y=8). Still plenty of space. Then next turn from (5,8) we could go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN (but DOWN back to (5,7) is safe after tail moves? Actually tail at (5,5) moves to (5,6) after we move, so (5,7) becomes empty next turn). Good options.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Puts us at (6,7), right next to another apple at (6,6)? Wait, board shows (6,6) is empty (just a dot). Actually (6,7) is an apple. Then from (6,7) we could go UP to (6,8) (empty), DOWN to (6,6) (empty), LEFT to (5,7) (our old head position, will be empty after tail moves), RIGHT to (7,7) (empty). Also good.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:** They might go for apples too. Closest apple to them is (5,2) or (7,4) etc. They're not near us yet. We have time to grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat an apple now to get to length 4, then start descending toward them to apply pressure with our longer body. With a 4 vs 2 advantage, we can be VERY aggressive \u2014 we can even trap them against a wall by threatening head-on collisions. They'll have to run, and we can herd them into a dead end!\n\nWhich move sets up better for cutting them off? If we go RIGHT to (6,7), we're more to their right side, maybe block them from moving rightward later. If we go UP to (5,8), we stay central but higher. I think RIGHT might be slightly better for starting a downward/leftward sweep to encircle them.\n\nBut also... LOOK AT THE BOARD CHAT! \ud83e\uddd0 There's an apple at (6,7) and another at (5,8). Both are good. But going RIGHT to (6,7) also moves us horizontally closer to them (x from 5 to 6, same x as enemy head at 6). That could set up a vertical chase.\n\nActually, let's think: Enemy at (6,3), us at (6,7) after moving right. That's same column, 4 spaces apart. Next turn we could go DOWN to (6,6) (empty), then (6,5), etc., directly toward them! That's a direct threat! They'll have to avoid moving up into us. That's PRESSURE!\n\nIf we go UP to (5,8), we're offset in x, less direct threat.\n\nI WANT TO APPLY PRESSURE NOW! We have the length advantage, let's use it! Go RIGHT, eat that apple, get to length 4, and next turn start moving down that same column to chase them! They'll have to flee left or right, and we can cut off the board!\n\nCHAT, ARE YOU WITH ME? \ud83d\ude24 LET'S GO RIGHT, EAT, AND START THE HUNT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

We're directly above them in column 6 vs 7, just 4 spaces away diagonally!\n\n- **DOWN to (6,5):** Moves us closer vertically (now 3 spaces away). Puts us in column 6, right beside their column 7. This is DIRECT PRESSURE! They'll feel us coming down! Next turn we could go to (6,4) or (5,5) to continue the chase. This path has NO apple right now, but it's aggressive!\n- **RIGHT to (7,6):** Moves us to same column as them (x=7) but we're way up at y=6, they're at y=2. That's 4 spaces vertical gap. Less immediate pressure. BUT there's an apple at (7,6)! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it grows us to length 5, making our lead HUGE (5 vs 3)! More length = more board control and more lethal head-on threat!\n\n**APPLE VS AGGRESSION TRADE-OFF:** Eating the apple at (7,6) is HUGE CONTENT! It grows us, extends our body, and strengthens our position. But it moves us horizontally aligned instead of vertically closing. However, with length 5, we become a massive wall they can't pass! We can then start descending next turn with even more dominance!\n\nGoing DOWN is pure chase, no growth. They might eat the apple at (7,1) and grow to length 4, closing the gap. We want to maintain our length advantage!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** EAT THE APPLE! Grow to length 5. Then next turn, from (7,6), we can move DOWN to (7,5) or LEFT to (6,6) (if clear) to continue pressuring them from above. With a 5-segment body, we can start cutting off the right side of the board. They're currently near the bottom-left; we can herd them into the corner! CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE GROWTH AND THEN THE SQUEEZE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- DOWN to (7,5): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Enemy can't reach. Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on. GOOD.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION!** We have length lead (5 vs 4)! We want to maintain dominance and possibly force a trap! Look at positions: We're directly above him in column 7. If we go DOWN to (7,5), we get closer, cutting off his upward escape! He's at (7,1), so we'd be 4 spaces above. But if we go DOWN, we miss apples. If we eat an apple, we grow to length 6, making our lead INSANE! But growing also extends our body, which could limit our mobility later. However, MORE LENGTH = MORE BOARD CONTROL AND MORE LETHAL HEAD-ON THREAT!\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (7,7):** Eat apple, grow to 6, move to top-middle. Puts us further from enemy but strengthens our lead. From there, we can come down later. Safe follow-ups? From (7,7): UP to (7,8) is apple? Actually (7,8) is empty? Board shows row 8, col 7 is '.'? Might be safe. LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN likely open. But we're moving away from the fight.\n- **RIGHT to (8,6):** Eat apple, grow to 6, move to right side. Puts us at (8,6), enemy at (7,1). We're still far but we dominate the right side. From there we can go DOWN/LEFT/UP to close in.\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** No apple, but we STEP DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE ENEMY! This is AGGRESSIVE! We're herding him into the bottom! He might feel trapped and make a mistake! Next turn from (7,5) we could go DOWN again to (7,4) (apple there!) or LEFT/RIGHT to cut off.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** CHAT, WE'RE HERE TO WIN, NOT JUST FARM! THE ENEMY IS WEAKER! WE NEED TO APPLY PRESSURE AND FORCE A CRASH! GOING DOWN GETS US CLOSER AND STARTS THE BOX-IN! If we go for an apple, we grow but give him space to maybe eat an apple too and catch up! WE CAN'T LET HIM BREATHE! Let's go DOWN and start the squeeze! Next turn, we can eat the apple at (7,4) and continue chasing!

WE'RE HUGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n**ENEMY STATUS:** Head at (5,1), body: [(6,1), (7,1), (7,2)] Length 4. Apples: 3.

Wait, that's an apple at (5,2) per the list! But is it safe for him? Board shows (5,2) as 'A'? Row 2, col 5 is 'A'? Actually row 2: \". . . . . A . T . .\" So (5,2) is 'A'!

(That's his neck!)\n\nSo enemy can go UP (apple), DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nWe need to see if any of our safe moves land where enemy could move simultaneously.\n- Our DOWN to (7,3): Enemy can't reach (7,3) in one move from (5,1). Safe.\n- Our LEFT to (6,4): Enemy can't reach (6,4). Safe.\n- Our RIGHT to (8,4): Enemy can't reach (8,4). Safe.\n\nNO IMMEDIATE HEAD-ON! GOOD! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION!** We have a BIG length lead (6 vs 4)! If he eats the apple at (5,2), he grows to 5, but we're still longer! We want to BOX HIM IN and force a crash! Look at his position \u2014 he's in the bottom-left corner! If we move LEFT to (6,4), we're getting closer to cut off his upward escape! From (6,4), next turn we could go DOWN to (6,3) or LEFT to (5,4) to tighten the noose! If we move RIGHT to (8,4), we're giving him space \u2014 NOT AGGRESSIVE! If we move DOWN to (7,3), we're moving away from him, but maybe setting up a future trap? Hmm...\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE KILL! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 MOVE LEFT TO (6,4)! This puts us directly above him and to the right, blocking his potential move to the right side! From there, we can pressure him downward toward the bottom wall! He's at (5,1) \u2014 if he goes UP to eat the apple, he's at (5,2) and grows, but then we can move to (6,3) or (5,4) to cut off his left/up options! With our length, we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision where WE WIN! Remember, if our heads collide, the longer snake survives! We're longer! So we want to threaten spaces he might want to go!\n\n**FUTURE SELF NOTE:** We're at (6,4) after this move. Next turn, look at enemy's new head position (likely (5,2) if he goes for apple). Then move to block his escape routes \u2014 maybe DOWN to (6,3) to cut off his path to the right, or LEFT to (5,4) to block above him. Keep the pressure and force him into a corner or into our body!

Also, from (6,3) we have options: LEFT to (5,3) to block him if he goes UP, or DOWN to (6,2) to challenge him directly! Moving LEFT to (5,4) is also good \u2014 it positions us above him to pressure downward. But DOWN feels more immediate pressure \u2014 we're taking a space that limits his rightward expansion and stays close!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're at (6,3) after this move.

If he's elsewhere, we can continue to cut off his space and herd him toward the bottom-left corner! Use our length to dominate the center and squeeze him! Keep the pressure \u2014 don't let him breathe or get to apples easily! We're the bigger snake, so force the issue! \ud83d\udea8\n\nDOWN",

NOW WE'RE ADJACENT! THIS IS IT CHAT! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (5,3):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,4) \u2705 Board shows '.' at (5,4)! SAFE!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2) \u274c ENEMY BODY! That's snake #0's body segment at (5,2)! DEATH!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3) \u274c ENEMY HEAD! That's where he is RIGHT NOW! But wait... simultaneous move! If we go LEFT and he stays, we collide heads and BOTH DIE! But if he moves away, it's empty? RISKY! Let's analyze enemy moves first!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) \u274c OUR OWN BODY! That's our neck! DEATH!\n\nSo UP is definitely safe. LEFT is risky depending on his move. DOWN and RIGHT are instant death! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,3):**\n- UP \u2192 (4,4) \u2705 Board shows 'A' at (4,4)! That's an apple! He might go for it!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2) \u274c HIS OWN BODY! That's his neck! DEATH!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3) \u2705 Board shows '.' at (3,3)! SAFE!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) \u274c OUR HEAD! That's us! If he goes RIGHT, he moves into our head's current cell \u2014 but we're moving simultaneously! If we stay, he dies. If we move LEFT into his cell, we both die. This is a MIND GAME! \ud83e\udde0\n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, or possibly RIGHT into us (suicide?).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nWe move simultaneously! Let's check each of our possible moves vs his possible moves.\n\nOur only safe move is UP to (5,4). Let's check:\n- We go UP to (5,4). He goes UP to (4,4) \u2192 no collision.\n- He goes LEFT to (3,3) \u2192 no collision.\n- He goes RIGHT to (5,3) \u2192 we're at (5,4), he's at (5,3) \u2192 no collision.\nSo UP is safe from head-on! \u2705\n\nWhat about LEFT to (4,3)? That's his current head cell.\n- We go LEFT to (4,3). He goes UP to (4,4) \u2192 we take his old spot, he moves away \u2192 no collision.\n- He goes LEFT to (3,3) \u2192 we take his old spot, he moves away \u2192 no collision.\n- He goes RIGHT to (5,3) \u2192 we both move into (4,3) and (5,3) respectively \u2192 no collision.\n- He STAYS? Snakes can't stay still, they must move. So he MUST move. So if he moves anywhere, (4,3) becomes empty, and we move into it. BUT WAIT \u2014 what if he moves RIGHT into (5,3) while we move LEFT into (4,3)? That's not a head-on. Head-on is when two heads move into the SAME cell. That would be if he moved LEFT into (3,3) and we moved LEFT into (4,3)? No, different cells. Actually, the only way for a head-on with us moving LEFT is if he moves RIGHT into (5,3) and we move LEFT into (4,3) \u2014 different cells. So moving LEFT into his current cell is safe from head-on IF he moves away. But what if he moves RIGHT into our current cell (5,3)? That's fine, we're not there anymore. So LEFT might be safe? BUT \u2014 moving LEFT into (4,3) is moving into a cell that is currently occupied by his head. The rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" That includes moving into a cell where another snake's head CURRENTLY is, because at the start of the turn, that's his head. But simultaneous move means we both move at the same time. If we both move, does that count as moving into his body? The rules say \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body\" \u2014 at the moment we move, his head is still there? Actually, simultaneous movement: we both leave our cells and enter new cells at the same time. So if we move into his starting cell, and he moves out of it, we are moving into a cell that becomes empty as he leaves. That is allowed \u2014 we are not colliding with his body because he is not there when we arrive. The collision only happens if two heads try to occupy the same new cell, or if we move into a cell that contains a snake body segment that does NOT move. Since his head moves, the cell (4,3) becomes empty. So moving LEFT into (4,3) is safe from collision with him, provided he doesn't also move into that same cell (which he can't, because he's leaving it). Wait, can he move into it? He starts at (4,3). He can't move into his own starting cell. So he cannot choose to stay. So (4,3) will be empty after he moves. Therefore, moving LEFT into (4,3) is SAFE! \ud83d\ude32\n\nBut is it safe from other dangers? (4,3) is within board bounds. No other snake body there (his head leaves). So LEFT is actually safe too! So we have TWO safe moves: UP and LEFT! DOWN and RIGHT are death.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION!** We have a length advantage! We want to force a head-on collision where we win! Enemy is at (4,3). If we move LEFT to (4,3), we are essentially taking his spot, forcing him to move away. That's aggressive \u2014 we're stepping on his toes! But does it set up a future head-on? Next turn, if we're at (4,3) and he's at (4,4), (3,3), or (5,3), we might be adjacent. If he's at (4,4) (if he goes UP), we're below him. If we move UP next turn, we could head-on collide at (4,4) \u2014 but that's only if he stays there. He might move. Hmm.\n\nIf we move UP to (5,4), we're above him if he goes LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3). If he goes UP to (4,4), we're diagonally adjacent. That's less aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're the bigger snake! We should try to get adjacent to his head and force a head-on next turn! Right now, if we move LEFT to (4,3), we are where he was. He will be at (4,4), (3,3), or (5,3). If he's at (4,4), next turn we could go UP to (4,4) for a head-on we win! If he's at (3,3), we could go LEFT to (3,3) for head-on! If he's at (5,3), we could go RIGHT to (5,3) for head-on! Moving LEFT sets up multiple head-on possibilities next turn! Moving UP to (5,4) puts us further away \u2014 less pressure.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (4,3) might make him feel trapped! He's near the left wall. We can herd him! CHAT, I THINK **LEFT TO (4,3)** IS THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY! WE TAKE HIS SPOT AND FORCE HIM TO FLEE! THEN NEXT TURN WE GO FOR THE KILL! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 what if he goes UP to (4,4) and eats the apple? He grows to length 6, tying us! Then a head-on next turn would be a tie (both die). That's bad! We want to force head-on while we're longer! So maybe we should move UP to (5,4) to block his access to the apple at (4,4)? Actually, from (5,4) we don't block (4,4). He can still go UP to (4,4) and eat it. Moving LEFT to (4,3) doesn't block (4,4) either. Hmm.\n\nIf he eats the apple, he ties our length. We lose our advantage. So we want to prevent that. How? By forcing him to move away from the apple! If we move LEFT to (4,3), he might go LEFT to (3,3) to avoid us, missing the apple. That's good! If we move UP to (5,4), he might still go UP to (4,4) for the apple. So LEFT is better to scare him away from the apple!\n\nLEFT IT IS! LET'S GO FOR THE THROAT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLEFT",
