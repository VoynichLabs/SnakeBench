Last turn's strategy emphasized continuing directly DOWN along x=1 to eat the nearby (1,1) apple, which remains the closest reachable apple without obstructions in that path (next step: DOWN to (1,2), position empty; turn after that: DOWN to (1,1) to eat).\n\nEvaluating all four possible moves:\n\n- UP: Impossible \u2013 head movement from (1,3) to (1,4) would crash directly into own body segment at (1,4), causing immediate death.\n\n- DOWN: Safe \u2013 moves to (1,2), an empty cell.

We just ate an apple at (1, 1) last turn, growing and tying the apple score at 3. Enemy snake (ID #0) head at (4, 7), body [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)], also at 3 apples.\n\nApples remaining: (9, 1) (far right on my row y=1, 7 steps away), (2, 8) (above me, but blocked), (3, 7) (near enemy head), (0, 7) (top-left), (1, 8) (directly above on x=1).\n\nBoard edges and bodies: y=1 row is mostly clear from x=2 to x=8. Enemy is on x=4, heads northward/downward. No immediate threats from enemy movement, as their head can't reach my adjacent cells in one turn.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\nFour directions:\n- UP: Impossible \u2013 (1, 2) is my own body (neck segment). Immediate death.\n- DOWN: Moves to (1, 0) \u2013 empty cell, but at board bottom edge (y=0), limiting future upward options and potentially trapping me low. No apple there; distant from targets. Could follow left/right along y=0, but worse mobility.\n- LEFT: Moves to (0, 1) \u2013 empty cell. Safe, with some mobility, but moves away from clustered apples and towards left edge. Could loop back, but deviates from efficient apple-grabbing paths.\n- RIGHT: Moves to (2, 1) \u2013 empty cell. Safe, positions me on a clear horizontal path along y=1 toward (9, 1). Keeps multiple follow-ups (right further or up/down at branches), opens options for nearby apples, and avoids edges. No collision risk with enemy head.\n\nEliminating UP as deadly. Among DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: RIGHT is best \u2013 it advances growth/score by targeting a reachable apple ((9, 1) via 7 more right moves), maintains high mobility (can zigzag or go up/down later), and avoids tight spots. DOWN and LEFT are safer but less optimal for apple access and long-term flexibility.\n\nNo head-on or other collision risks observed; enemy path appears separate.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\nContinue RIGHT along y=1 to fill the row toward (9, 1) for another easy eat (path: to (2,1) this turn, then (3,1), etc., up to (9,1) in ~7 turns). This keeps horizontal elongation for safety and maneuverability. After eating (9, 1), grow to 4 apples and consider: if enemy hasn't interfered, zig up to (9, 2) toward empty space or pivot left for (0, 7) at x=0 if y=7 becomes accessible. Monitor enemy head \u2013 if they creep down (e.g., to y=6 or lower), shift to zig toward top-left apples or bank apples to force a pursuit. Avoid vertical traps near body.\n\nRIGHT",

The (9, 1) is reachable along y=1 with clear horizontal path; no immediate obstacles on that row. Other apples are farther or potentially contested by enemy movement.\n\nBoard edges and bodies: y=1 row is open from x=3 to x=8 (with apple at x=9); my body blocks the line at x=1-2. Enemy is vertically aligned on x=4, heading down; their head at (3, 7) could move toward apples like (0, 7) or (2, 8), but no direct threat to my path yet. No collisions possible this turn based on positions.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\nFour directions:\n- UP: Moves to (2, 2) \u2013 empty cell. Provides mobility upwards, potentially toward (6, 2) on y=2 via horizontal movement (distance ~5 moves: UP then right 4). Avoids enemy vertically, keeps options open (can zigzag down/left later).

Limits upward mobility long-term, might trap low (jackpot if enemy pursues, but risky). Distant from apples; could shift strategy but deviates from clear path.\n- LEFT: Moves to (1, 1) \u2013 into my own body (neck segment).

Among UP, DOWN, RIGHT: RIGHT is best \u2013 efficient apple pursuit, maintains horizontal freedom, avoids edges. UP is viable but slightly indirect; DOWN is worst for long-term options and apple proximity. No head-on risks observed; enemy likely pursues apples near (3, 7).\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\nContinue RIGHT along y=1 toward (9, 1) to eat easily and tie/merge apple scores (currently trailing by 1). After eating, with grown body, assess: if enemy hasn't closed gap, pivot UP to (2, 2+) for (6, 2) or LEFT for (0, 7) if they move away; otherwise, bank apples by zigzagging vertically for safety (e.g., up/down on open x-rows) to outpace enemy elongation. Monitor enemy head \u2013 if they drop to y=6 or lower toward me, switch to vertical pursuit or box-awareness to avoid traps. Aim to hit 5 apples before enemy expands.\n\nRIGHT",

Monitor enemy movement\u2014if they descend at all toward y=1-6 (possible with RIGHT/UP patterns), prioritize vertical RETURNS to stay higher for safety/tools evasion. Keep body compaction in mind; avoid letting enemy snake elongate severely or box me into low y-rows. Aim to overtake to 5+ apples while forcing enemy to riskier paths.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake head at (2,8), body [(3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)] \u2013 longer (6 segments), heading vertically downward but has options toward nearby apples ((0,7), (1,8)) or even potential descent. Apples: (9,1) remains the closest clear target with a straight horizontal path along y=1 (x=5 to x=9 all empty based on board). Other options like (6,2) would require up and right, adding detours, while lower apples ((1,2)) are too far west. Enemy scores 5 apples vs. my 3; no direct threats to y=1 this turn, as enemy can't reach x=4-5 row suddenly from x=2 without horizontal movement.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\nSafe directions (UP, RIGHT, DOWN):\n- UP: To (4,2) \u2013 empty, opens space but deviates westbound toward (6,2) or (1,2), requiring zigzag backtracking and increasing distance to (9,1) without immediate payoff. Keeps some vertical options but risks enemy downward pursuit if they shift south.\n- DOWN: To (4,0) \u2013 bottom edge, all empty horizontally, but limits upward returns long-term, traps low without advancing apples, and edges out future flexibility worse than staying on y=1.\n- RIGHT: To (5,1) \u2013 empty, continues infallible path to (9,1) (4 more RIGHT moves: (6,1) to (9,1)). Maintains high horizontal mobility, direct apple pursuit to close score gap, avoids edges/enemy interference, and keeps UP/DOWN escape open. Mirrors last turn's rationale perfectly for efficiency.\n\nRIGHT remains optimal \u2013 prioritize the exposed apple first for quick tie/lead potential, as deviating now wastes the cleared path. Enemy ascending toward (1,8)/(0,7) or holding could let me capitalize undisturbed.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\nRight along y=1 to eat (9,1) on next move (grow to 5 segments total, reach 4 apples). Post-eat at (9,1), body extends tailward \u2013 immediately pivot UP to (9,2) (assuming empty; if not, check board) for vertical space, then LEFT to y=2 row and RIGHT toward (6,2) for 5th apple in 2-3 moves. Monitor enemy: if heading DOWN from (2,8), they might try cutting south near x=3-4; preempt by staying high for overhead evasion. If (9,1) is eaten instead, shift to (6,2) as next priority. Avoid right-edge traps post-growth; aim to control mid-board for sustained apple hunts while blocking enemy paths if possible.\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps horizontal options on y=2 if enemy approaches south, avoids backing into own body blocks on y=1, and opens paths to multiple apples like (6,2) or potentially (2,6) later without committing too far east.\n- RIGHT: To (6,1) \u2013 empty, continues clear path along y=1 toward (9,1) as per last strategy (now 3 moves to apple), but deviates toward (6,2) if followed by UP next turn. Solid, but slightly farther from quickest apple gain compared to UP, and sticks closer to edge after growth.\n- DOWN: To (5,0) \u2013 empty, moves to bottom row with full horizontal space, but increases distance to all nearby apples, limits upward mobility long-term without strong apple reasons, and makes future traps likelier if enemy descends south.\n\nUP is preferable \u2013 switches focus to closer (6,2) apple for faster score closure (eat in ~2 moves total), maintains branching options (LEFT/RIGHT/UP from (5,2)), and avoids prolonged low/y=1 commitment where enemy might eventually interfere if they head south. Prioritize vertical mobility and low-risk apple pursuit.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\nMove UP to (5,2); continue RIGHT next turn to (6,2) to eat apple, reaching 4 apples at (6,2). Post-eat, assess: prefer horizontal moves along y=2 (RIGHT to (7,2) or LEFT to (5,2)) for mid-board control; avoid descending back to y=1 unless enemy clears space. If (6,2) blocked or enemy eats it first, pivot toward (2,6) by going LEFT on y=2 then DOWN, or chase remaining apples like (9,1).

Apples remaining: (9,1) (nearby, easy via either RIGHT-DOWN or DOWN-RIGHT paths), (1,2), (2,6), (5,8), (9,4). Board open in mid-east y=2/y=1 corridors; enemy still clustered near (2,6)/(1,2) axes, no immediate threats to my position. Head-on risk low; enemy far west.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\nSafe directions: UP (8,3) empty, maintains y=3 space but adds distance to (9,1); DOWN (8,1) empty, equally viable for two-move path to (9,1) via (9,1) RIGHT, avoids clashing with planned path; RIGHT (9,2) empty, directly continues last turn's RIGHT momentum for two-move apple grab (RIGHT then DOWN), spares y-axis evasive options without closing access; no LEFT (into (7,2) own body). No off-board, self-collision, or enemy body risks.\n\nRIGHT best \u2013 stays true to established y=2 east strategy for efficient (9,1) approach, keeps all flanks open for future pivots (e.g., toward (9,4) or north if enemy surges south). DOWN is equally safe and direct but abandons the planned horizontal line.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turn\nWith RIGHT to (9,2) locked, head at (9,2), body [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]. Prioritize DOWN to (9,1) for apple #5 and growth \u2013 simple, direct, no hazards seen. Watch enemy: if RIGHT to (2,6) eating that apple, reclaim y=2 space defensively; if DOWN path blocked unexpectedly (unlikely), loop UP to (9,3) for (9,4) dive later or mid-board roam. Avoid early vertical detours; anticipate potential enemy pivot north post-south actions.\n\nRIGHT",

Ideal for rapid scoring while avoiding dead-ends.\n  - DOWN: To (1,0), empty, leads downward but away from clustered apples, limiting upward access and potentially dead-ending in row 0.\n  - LEFT: To (0,1), eats apple at (0,1) (apple #6), grows, but traps me in column 0 dead-end (only UP out to (0,2), then zigzags needed to escape, complicating path to column 1 apples).\n  - RIGHT: To (2,1), own body, invalid (immediate self-hit).\n\n- **Preferred Move Selection**: UP best advances progress \u2013 direct eat + prep for (1,3) next turn, maintains mobility (e.g., right/western options post-eat), avoids enemy-adjacent risks, and outperforms LEFT's dead-end detour for clustered targets. Aligns with safe apple hunting and open futures.\n\n**Short-Term Plan for Next 2-3 Turns: Eat the stacked apples at (1,2) then (1,3) successively. After (1,3), explore east toward (3,9) or further, or left via (0,anything), watching enemy head (now at 4/5,8 area) for encroaches into column 1. Adjust if enemy blocks column 1 descent or moves toward (3,9). Prioritize chained apples for score tiebreak (currently behind).**\n\nUP",

The (1,7) in column 1 is directly up (path clear to (1,5)/(1,6)/(1,7) with no snake blocks).\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation** (eliminating immediate deaths like off-board, own-body hit including backwards, or enemy body hit):\n  - UP: To (1,5), empty-clear (row5 col1 empty, not into body; board space above open toward (1,7) apple). Keeps column 1 chain active for eat #8, reducing 3-apple gap with enemy at 10 apples. Post-move multi-options (UP further, LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5)). Avoids projecting enemy head paths (e.g., if enemy at (7,9) moves down/right, they'd be distant top-right).\n  - DOWN: To (1,3), direct-self-hit (own body behind head, dies immediately as per rule on moving backwards or into own body). Invalid.\n  - LEFT: To (0,4), empty-clear (row4 col0 empty). Detours toward column 0 apples ((0,1)/(0,9)), but narrower path (column 0 has my body tail at (5,1)? Wait, tail at (5,1) col5, no; column 1 is my spine). Column 0 row1-dead-end risk if trapped, enemy might snake horizontally. Multi-options post (UP/DOWN/RIGHT from (0,4)), but less immediate eat progress than column 1 chain.\n  - RIGHT: To (2,4), empty-clear (row4 col2 empty). Explores mid-board toward (3,9)/(9,4) apples, keeping broad open space for options (UP/DOWN/LEFT from (2,4)). But delays column 1 eat, allowing enemy top-success potential to widen lead; safer if column 1 congests, but sub-optimal now.\n- **Preferred Move Selection**: UP prioritizes immediate apple access ((1,7) eat likely next 2-3 moves), aligning with prior chain-strategy to close apple gap. Superior to LEFT/RIGHT (both bypass eat; LEFT risks narrow traps). No head-on risk (enemy head far at (7,9)).\n\n**Short-Term Plan for Next 2-3 Turns: Stay on column 1 UP chain to (1,5) this turn, then (1,6)/(1,7) for eat #8. After eating (1,7), check respawns; if more in column 1, continue; else RIGHT to (2,7) toward (3,9) open mid-board or LEFT to (0,7) for (0,9) if enemy is top-locked. Track enemy head (likely downish from (7,9)) to avoid crossings; avoid over-longin column if tail blocks thwart retreats. Prioritize eats over space if gap narrows.**\n\nUP",
