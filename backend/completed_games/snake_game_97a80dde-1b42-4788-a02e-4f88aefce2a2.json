I successfully collected the apple that was at (5, 4) - my snake has grown and I now have 1 point.\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n- My head is at (5, 4) marked as \"0\"\n- My body segments are at (5, 5) and (6, 5) marked as \"T\"\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (2, 6) with no body segments yet\n- Remaining apples are at: (3, 0), (0, 4), (3, 8), (9, 2)\n\nNow I need to plan my next move carefully since my snake is longer:\n\nMovement options:\n- UP to (5, 5) - NO! This would hit my own body segment and kill me\n- DOWN to (5, 3) - Safe, moves toward the apple at (3, 0)\n- LEFT to (4, 4) - Safe, moves toward the apple at (0, 4) or (3, 0)\n- RIGHT to (6, 4) - Safe, but moves away from most apples\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 6) is still relatively close but not an immediate threat. They appear to be positioned between the apples at (0, 4) and (3, 8).\n\nLooking at apple distances:\n- (0, 4): 5 moves away (5 left)\n- (3, 0): 6 moves away (2 left, 4 down)\n- (3, 8): 6 moves away (2 left, 4 up)\n- (9, 2): 6 moves away (4 right, 2 down)\n\nI think moving LEFT toward (4, 4) gives me good positioning to go for either the (0, 4) or (3, 0) apple depending on where the enemy snake moves. This keeps my options open.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward one of the closer apples while monitoring the enemy snake's position. Avoid getting trapped in corners or against walls.\n\nLEFT"

But I'm already committed to the (3, 8) apple and it's the optimal move.\n\nThe choice is obvious - I should move UP to (3, 8) to collect the apple. This will give me a point and make my snake grow.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to plan my next move. From (3, 8), I'll have several options:\n- I could go for the apple at (4, 7) by moving RIGHT then DOWN\n- I could go for the apple at (1, 7) by moving LEFT twice\n- I could go for the apple at (7, 8) though that's further away\n\nThe apple at (4, 7) seems like the most logical next target since it's close and won't require me to navigate around my own body as much.\n\nThe enemy snake is still in the lower right area around (7, 2), so no immediate threat to my current path.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (3, 8), evaluate the best path to either (4, 7) or (1, 7). Likely move RIGHT to (4, 8) to set up an approach to the (4, 7) apple, but check for safety first.\n\nUP"

This would be moving into my own body, which would kill me. Not an option.\n\n**DOWN to (4, 6)** - This appears to be clear space. This could be a safe move.\n\n**LEFT to (3, 7)** - This would move me into my own body segment. Not an option.\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 7)** - This appears to be clear space and would move me toward the right side of the board.\n\nWait, let me double-check the board representation. Looking at the board state shown:\n- Row 7 shows: `. A . T 0 . . . . .`\n- My head (0) is at position (4, 7)\n- There's a T (my body) at (3, 7)\n- There's an A at (1, 7)\n\nSo from (4, 7), my safe options are:\n- **DOWN to (4, 6)** - Clear space\n- **RIGHT to (5, 7)** - Clear space\n\nThe apple at (1, 7) is to my left, but I can't move directly left due to my body. However, I could potentially navigate around to get it.\n\nLooking at the other apples:\n- (1, 7) - relatively close but requires maneuvering around my body\n- (7, 8) - upper right, accessible\n- (0, 5) - left side, might be challenging with my body positioning\n- (0, 2) - bottom left, far away\n\nI think moving RIGHT to (5, 7) would be a good choice as it:\n1. Keeps me safe\n2. Gives me flexibility to move toward multiple apples\n3. Moves me away from my long body segment that's occupying the left side\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving right, assess whether to continue toward the apple at (7, 8) or find a way to loop around for the apple at (1, 7). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position to avoid conflicts.\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake's head is at (8, 6) and their body doesn't extend to the top row. My own body doesn't occupy (7, 9) either.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should continue moving left along the top edge. This keeps me safe from collisions while positioning me to eventually access the apple cluster on the left side, particularly the apple at (1, 7). I can continue left to (6, 9), (5, 9), etc., and then when I'm ready, I can drop down toward the apples.\n\nThe enemy snake seems to be occupying the middle-right portion of the board, so staying on the top edge and moving left is the safest path while also being strategically sound for apple collection.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** Continue left along the top edge until I'm positioned above the apple at (1, 7), then consider dropping down to collect it.\n\nLEFT"
