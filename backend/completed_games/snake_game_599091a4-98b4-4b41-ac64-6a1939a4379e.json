A\nRow 8: . . . A . . . . . .\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A 1 .\nRow 6: A . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2: . . . . . 0 A . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n```\nHere, `1` represents your snake's head, `0` represents the enemy snake's head, and `A` represents apples.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Immediate Threats and Safe Moves\nYour snake is currently at (8, 7). The four possible moves are:\n1. **UP**: (8, 8)\n2. **DOWN**: (8, 6)\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 7)\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 7)\n\nWe need to check each move for immediate threats:\n- **UP (8, 8)**: Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy's head or your own body. Enemy head is at (5, 2), so no immediate threat. Also, no body to collide with.\n- **DOWN (8, 6)**: Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy's head or your own body. Enemy head is at (5, 2), so no immediate threat. Also, no body to collide with.\n- **LEFT (7, 7)**: Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy's head or your own body. Enemy head is at (5, 2), so no immediate threat. Also, no body to collide with.\n- **RIGHT (9, 7)**: Check if this cell is occupied by the enemy's head or your own body. Enemy head is at (5, 2), so no immediate threat. Also, no body to collide with.\n\nAll four moves are safe in terms of immediate threats.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Apple Proximity and Future Options\nNow, let's evaluate each move based on apple proximity and future options:\n\n1. **UP (8, 8)**:\n   - No apple is directly adjacent to (8, 8). The closest apple is (9, 9), which is two steps away diagonally (not directly adjacent).\n   - Moving up will leave you in a position where you can move down or left in the next turn, but not directly towards any apple.\n\n2. **DOWN (8, 6)**:\n   - There is an apple at (6, 2), which is not directly adjacent but is somewhat reachable. However, moving down will not immediately get you closer to any apple.\n   - The cell (8, 6) is adjacent to (8, 7) and (7, 6), but no apple is directly adjacent to (8, 6).\n\n3. **LEFT (7, 7)**:\n   - There is an apple at (7, 7), which is exactly where you are moving to! This is a direct hit on an apple.\n   - This move will immediately increase your score by 1 apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9, 7)**:\n   - No apple is directly adjacent to (9, 7). The closest apple is (9, 9), which is two steps away vertically.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Enemy Movement\nThe enemy snake is at (5, 2). It can move in any of the four directions:\n- **UP**: (5, 3)\n- **DOWN**: (5, 1)\n- **LEFT**: (4, 2)\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 2)\n\nThe apple at (6, 2) is a potential target for the enemy. If the enemy moves right to (6, 2), it will eat the apple and grow. This could be a risk if the enemy is aggressive.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy and Future Plans\n**Short-term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n- **Turn 1**: Eat the apple at (7, 7) by moving LEFT. This will grow the snake and increase your score.\n- **Turn 2**: After eating (7, 7), your snake will have a body segment at (7, 7). Now, move UP to (8, 8) to avoid the enemy's potential move to (6, 2) and explore new areas.\n- **Turn 3**: From (8, 8), move LEFT to (7, 8) to get closer to the apple at (9, 9) or (0, 6).\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe immediate and safest move that maximizes your score is to move LEFT to (7, 7) and eat the apple.\n\n---\n**LEFT**",
