RIGHT: Would go to (5, 9) - valid\n\nNow let's evaluate the safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):\n\nDOWN (4,8):\n- Doesn't hit any bodies (no bodies exist yet)\n- Doesn't go off board\n- Moves away from enemy (enemy is at (9,8))\n- Doesn't reach any apples immediately\n- Keeps good positioning for future moves\n\nLEFT (3,9):\n- Doesn't hit any bodies\n- Doesn't go off board\n- Moves away from enemy\n- Doesn't reach any apples\n- Keeps me at the top edge, which might limit future options\n\nRIGHT (5,9):\n- Doesn't hit any bodies\n- Doesn't go off board\n- Moves toward enemy (enemy is at (9,8))\n- Doesn't reach any apples\n- Could lead to potential conflict with enemy\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- I'm at the top edge, so moving DOWN gives me more space to maneuver\n- The closest apples are at (2,3) and (1,0) - moving DOWN starts heading toward these\n- Moving LEFT keeps me at the edge which could be limiting\n- Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy which could be risky\n\nBest move: DOWN - it's safe, moves me toward apples, and gives me more board space to work with.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n- Continue moving downward to get away from the top edge\n- Head toward the apples at (2,3) or (1,0)\n- Monitor enemy movement and avoid head-on collisions\n- Be prepared to adjust if enemy moves aggressively\n\nDOWN",

Wait, no: if you move LEFT to (8, 8), your body is now just the head at (8, 8) (since you're length 1). Wait, no: your snake is length 1, so moving LEFT to (8, 8) would make your new head at (8, 8), and your body is empty (since you're length 1). Wait, no: your snake is length 1, so moving LEFT to (8, 8) would make your new head at (8, 8), and your body is empty (since you're length 1). Wait, no: your snake is length 1, so moving LEFT to (8, 8) would make your new head at (8, 8), and your body is empty (since you're length 1).\n\n**Pros:**\n- Avoids immediate danger.\n- Keeps you away from the enemy's current position (4, 9).\n\n**Cons:**\n- No immediate apple collection.\n- Future moves from (8, 8) are limited in terms of apple proximity.\n\n#### **Option 2: DOWN (to (9, 7))**\n- New head position: (9, 7)\n- Check for apples: No apple at (9, 7).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - No other snake's body is at (9, 7) (enemy is at (4, 9)).\n  - No self-collision (only one segment).\n- Future options:\n  - From (9, 7), you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n  - Moving UP would go to (9, 8), which is your current position, but since you're moving to (9, 7), your body would be at (9, 8), so moving UP would be invalid (backwards into your own body). Wait, no: if you move DOWN to (9, 7), your body is now just the head at (9, 7) (since you're length 1).\n\n**Pros:**\n- Moving toward the apple at (9, 2) in a straight line.\n- More direct path to the apple at (9, 2) compared to moving LEFT.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Still no immediate apple collection.\n- Enemy is not directly in the way, but moving down could potentially lead to a dead-end if the apple at (9, 2) is not reachable in the long term.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Avoid immediate danger and explore the board to find the most accessible apples.\n- **Apple Prioritization:** The apple at (9, 2) is closest to your current position if you move DOWN. The apple at (6, 7) is reachable but requires more movement.\n- **Enemy Position:** The enemy is at (4, 9), which is not directly in your path if you move DOWN or LEFT.\n- **Future Moves:** If you move DOWN to (9, 7), you can continue moving DOWN to (9, 6), (9, 5), etc., eventually reaching (9, 2). If you move LEFT to (8, 8), you can explore other directions but may not be as efficient in reaching the apple at (9, 2).\n\n---\n\n### **Decision**\nGiven the immediate proximity of the apple at (9, 2) and the safety of moving DOWN, it is the best choice to move toward the apple efficiently.\n\n**DOWN**",

This is the most efficient next move to grow and secure a point.\n   - After collecting **(9,2)**, I\u2019ll pivot toward **(6,7)** or **(1,7)** (closer and higher-value targets). The apples at **(1,0)** and **(0,1)** are distant and can be revisited later if needed.\n   - The enemy (ID 0) is at **(1,2)** with body at **(1,3)**. They are moving toward **(1,7)** or **(6,7)** but are not blocking my path to **(9,2)**.\n\n2. **Enemy Positioning:**\n   - Enemy is at **(1,2)** with body at **(1,3)**. They are likely moving **UP** or **RIGHT** next. If they move toward **(1,7)**, they may block my path later, but not immediately.\n   - If they move toward **(6,7)**, I\u2019ll need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\n3. **Snake Growth and Traps:**\n   - After collecting **(9,2)**, my snake will grow to length 2. I must ensure the new tail doesn\u2019t block future movement.\n   - The enemy is also length 2, so collision risk increases if we cross paths.\n\n4. **Future Moves:**\n   - After reaching **(9,2)**, I\u2019ll need to decide whether to:\n     - Move **DOWN** to **(9,1)**, then **LEFT** to **(8,1)**, etc., to reach **(6,7)**.\n     - Or pivot toward **(1,7)** if it becomes more accessible.\n   - If the enemy starts moving toward **(9,2)**, I may need to adjust my path to avoid collision.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment:**\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to **(9,2)** is safe and collects the apple immediately.\n   - Moving **UP** to **(8,3)** is safe but doesn\u2019t help with apple collection.\n   - Moving **DOWN** to **(8,1)** is safe but doesn\u2019t help with apple collection.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to **(7,2)** is safe but doesn\u2019t help with apple collection.\n\n**Current Turn Analysis (Head at (8,2)):**\n- **Possible Moves:**\n  - **UP**: (8,2) \u2192 (8,3) (safe, no collision)\n  - **DOWN**: (8,2) \u2192 (8,1) (safe, no collision)\n  - **LEFT**: (8,2) \u2192 (7,2) (safe, no collision)\n  - **RIGHT**: (8,2) \u2192 (9,2) (safe, collects apple)\n\n- **Apples Nearby:**\n  - **(9,2)**: Directly reachable by moving **RIGHT**.\n  - **(6,7)**: Reachable but requires more complex maneuvering.\n  - **(1,0), (0,1)**: Too far for now.\n\n- **Enemy Position:**\n  - Enemy is at **(1,2)** (from last move info). They moved **DOWN** last turn, so they\u2019re likely at **(1,2)** now.\n  - No immediate collision risk.\n\n- **Best Move:**\n  - Moving **RIGHT** to **(9,2)** is the most efficient way to collect the apple immediately.\n  - This move maximizes growth and sets up future flexibility.\n\n---\n**RIGHT**",
