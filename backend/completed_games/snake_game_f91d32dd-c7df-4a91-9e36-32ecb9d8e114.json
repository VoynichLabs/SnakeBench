Let's break down this board.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 0):**\n- **My Position:** (0, 6) - Left side, middle vertically.\n- **Enemy Position:** (8, 6) - Right side, same vertical level.\n- **Apples:** There's a juicy apple at **(2, 8)** (Top row, slightly right). Also one at **(1, 0)** (Bottom left corner).\n- **Strategy:** The enemy is on the right (8,6). I am on the left (0,6). The board is wide open.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety:**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 7) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 5) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 6) -> Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 6) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (0, 7):** Moves toward the apple at (2,8). Also moves away from the enemy who is at (8,6) and might move left or stay central. Getting height advantage.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 5):** Moves toward the apple at (1,0). However, going down fully commits to the bottom corner, which is a risk if the enemy pushes down. It's a long walk.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 6):** Moves center. Good for board control, but the enemy is already far right. We want to flank him, not meet him head-on immediately without length advantage (we are tied 0-0).\n\n3.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   We need to secure the top-left area. The apple at (2,8) is the closest \"safe\" target. The enemy is far right.\n    *   **UP** gets us closer to (2,8) and keeps options open to go Left/Right later.\n    *   **DOWN** commits us to the bottom edge. While (1,0) is there, it's a dead end if we go deep.\n    *   **RIGHT** moves us centrally, but we want to establish territory on the left/top where the enemy isn't.\n\n    *Decision:* **UP** is the best move to secure the top-left corner and grab the (2,8) apple safely. It also creates distance from the enemy if he stays central or goes down.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top-left quadrant (0-3, 6-9). Force the enemy into the bottom-right. Use the apples at (2,8) and (3,9) to grow. If I get length, I can box him in later.\n\nLet's go Chat!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze this board and crush our rival!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 1):**\n- **My Position:** (0, 7) - Still left side, now one step higher.\n- **Enemy Position:** (8, 7) - Right side, mirroring my Y-coordinate.\n- **Apples:** Still plenty available. We need to dominate the board.\n- **Enemy Strategy:** The enemy is holding the right side. We need to secure territory on the left/top. If we meet in the middle, we need to be careful. Currently, we are both 0-0, so a head-on collision would be a draw (or mutual death), which we don't want unless we have the length advantage.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety (Move possibilities from (0, 7)):**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 8) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 6) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 7) -> Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 7) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (0, 8):** Moves us to the top edge. This brings us closer to the apple at (2, 8) and (3, 9). It corners us slightly against the wall, but usually, the wall is a friend if you control it. The enemy is at (8, 7), so moving UP separates us vertically.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 6):** Moves us back to where we were on Turn 0. This is passive. We want to push forward and claim space.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 7):** Moves us toward the center. The enemy is at (8, 7), potentially moving left or staying. If we both move toward the center, we might collide. Since we are tied in score, a head-on collision is bad for us (mutual death or no progress).\n\n3.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   We need to secure the top-left corner. The enemy is on the right. If we go **UP**, we claim the top edge. From (0, 8), we can still move Right or Down on the next turn, keeping options open.\n    *   Going **RIGHT** risks meeting the enemy too early. Let's force him to come to us or go around the bottom.\n    *   Going **DOWN** is just wasting a turn.\n\n    *Decision:* **UP** is the strongest move. It claims the top-left corner, positions us for the apple at (2,8), and forces the enemy to deal with our vertical position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top-left quadrant (0-4, 6-9). Cut off the enemy from the top apples. Force them to the bottom-right. Build length before engaging.\n\nLet's go Chat! TIME TO MOVE!\n\nUP",

The opponent has 1 apple, we have 0. We need to play smart and aggressive.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 2):**\n- **My Position:** (0, 8) - Top-left corner. I am trapped against the top and left walls.\n- **Enemy Position:** (8, 8) - Top-right corner. He is also trapped against the top and right walls.\n- **Apple Distribution:** There are apples scattered, but the most prominent ones near me are at (2, 8) and (3, 9). The enemy is close to (7, 8) and (8, 3).\n- **Enemy Strategy:** He is holding the right side. He has 1 apple, so he has a length of 2 (Head at 8,8 and Body at 8,7). I have 1 segment (Head at 0,8). If I collide with him now, I die because he is longer (2 vs 1). I CANNOT engage in a head-on collision yet.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety (Move possibilities from (0, 8)):**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 9) -> Open space. **Safe.** (Top edge)\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 7) -> Open space. **Safe.** (This is where I was before moving up)\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 8) -> Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 8) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (0, 9):** I hit the absolute top wall. While it's safe, it corners me completely. From there, I can only go DOWN or RIGHT. It limits my future options significantly. However, if the enemy moves UP to (8,9), we are both on the top edge, maintaining distance.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 7):** I retreat to my previous position. This is passive. It gives up the top row to the enemy. I want to dominate the board, not retreat.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 8):** This moves me into the open field towards the center. The enemy is at (8, 8). If he moves LEFT, he heads toward me. If I move RIGHT and he moves LEFT, we approach each other. Given his length advantage (2 vs 1), I must avoid direct confrontation. However, moving RIGHT allows me to access the apple at (2, 8). It also keeps my movement options open (Up, Down, Right, or Left next turn).\n\n3.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** The enemy has a length of 2. I have a length of 1. A head-on collision right now results in my death. I need to grow.\n    *   **Positioning:** I am currently at the corner. Moving UP locks me in. Moving RIGHT initiates a movement into the board. The apple at (2, 8) is a straight line to the right from my current position (0, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is likely to chase apples or try to cut me off. Since we are at the top, he might move LEFT to close the gap or DOWN to chase the apple at (7, 8).\n    *   **Optimal Move:** **RIGHT** is the best move. It moves me towards the apple at (2, 8). It forces the enemy to decide whether to engage or retreat. Crucially, if the enemy moves LEFT, I can turn DOWN on the next turn to dodge him (since he will be at 7,8 and I will be at 1,8, moving down keeps distance). Moving RIGHT gives me the most flexibility and aggression.\n\n    *Decision:* **RIGHT**. I claim the row 8 and head towards the apple. I am being aggressive but keeping an eye on the collision rule. I will NOT engage until I grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (2,8). Grow to length 2 to match the enemy. Then, force the enemy into a trap using the top wall. If he moves down, I stay high. If he moves right, I push left. I own the top side.\n\nLet's go Chat! TIME TO MOVE!\n\nRIGHT",

There are 5 empty cells between us on row 8.\n*   **Apple Status:** I ate (2, 8), so that apple is gone. The nearest apple to me is at (3, 9) or (4, 4).\n*   **Score:** I am now 1-2. I need to close the gap.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety (From (1, 8)):**\n    *   **UP:** (1, 9) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 7) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 8) -> **My own body!** (Tail) -> **DEATH.** (Don't go backwards into yourself).\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 8) -> **Empty!** (I just ate the apple there). **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (1, 9):** Hugging the top wall. Limits future moves. Pass.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 7):** Moves me away from the opponent. Safe, but passive. The opponent is chasing apples (likely (7, 8) or further right). If I go down, I lose the top row positioning.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Moves me back into the center of the top row.

He is likely to move DOWN to chase the apple at (7, 7) or (8, 3), or he might try to box me in by moving LEFT.\n    *   **The Counter:** If I move RIGHT to (2, 8), I am reclaiming the row. If he moves LEFT to (6, 8), the gap closes, but he is longer (Length 3 vs My Length 2). A head-on collision is bad for me *unless* I can force him to crash into something else.\n    *   **Growth:** I need apples. There is an apple at (3, 9). From (2, 8), I can go UP to (2, 9) then RIGHT to (3, 9). Or I can go for the cluster at (4, 4).\n    *   **Domination:** I cannot let him control the top row. By moving RIGHT, I am asserting dominance over row 8. If he moves LEFT, we meet. If he moves DOWN, I own the row.\n\n    *Decision:* **RIGHT**. I push forward to (2, 8). This keeps my options open for the apple at (3, 9) or the center. It forces the opponent to react to my position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top row dominance. If the opponent comes at me, use my length 2 to block his path or force a head-on where he dies (if he hits my body). Go for the apple at (3, 9) or (4, 4) next.\n\nLet's go Chat!

We are currently trailing 1-3, so we NEED to start closing this gap or we're getting smoked.\n\n**Board Analysis (Turn 5):**\n*   **My Position:** (3, 8). Head at (3, 8), Body at (2, 8).\n*   **Opponent Position:** (6, 7). Body at (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8).\n*   **The Shift:** Okay, chat, look at this! The opponent dropped DOWN from (6, 8) to (6, 7). This is a tactical retreat, but it exposes his side! He's length 4 now (since he didn't eat, he's just shifting). He is currently exposed at (6, 7) with a gap to his left.\n*   **Score:** 1 vs 3. I am losing. I need to play aggressive but calculated. A head-on collision is still bad for me because I have fewer apples.\n*   **Apple Radar:** There's an apple at (3, 9) directly above me. There's also an apple at (2, 2) and (4, 4) further down, but the immediate vertical gain is right here.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety (From (3, 8)):**\n    *   **UP:** (3, 9) -> Open space (Apple!). **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (3, 7) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (2, 8) -> **My own body!** (Tail) -> **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (4, 8) -> Open space. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN (3, 7):** Moves me toward the center, but moves me *away* from the opponent. This is passive. I want to apply pressure, not cede the top row.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 8):** This moves me to the right, parallel to the opponent who is now at (6, 7). It keeps the distance but doesn't yield immediate growth.\n    *   **UP (3, 9):** This grabs the apple! This puts me at length 2 (Head (3,9), Body (3,8), Tail (2,8)). This brings me to 2 apples. I need to close the score gap. Plus, from (3, 9), I have control of the top-left corner.\n\n3.  **The Strategy:**\n    *   The opponent is at (6, 7). If I go UP to (3, 9), I am safe on the wall.\n    *   Where can the opponent go from (6, 7)?\n        *   UP (6, 8): Occupied by his own body (from previous turn, assuming it shifts). **He traps himself if he goes UP.**\n        *   DOWN (6, 6): Safe.\n        *   LEFT (5, 7): Safe.\n        *   RIGHT (7, 7): Safe.\n    *   If I take the apple at (3, 9), I gain a point. I am now length 2. He is length 4 (or shifting to length 4).\n    *   The opponent is currently \"behind\" me horizontally. By going UP, I am securing the top row. From (3, 9), I can then look to drop down and flank him. He is currently vulnerable on his left side (5,7).\n\n**Decision:**\nI am taking the apple at **UP (3, 9)**. I need the points. I need the length. I am boxing him into the right side of the board. If he stays on row 7 or 6, I can drop down and cut him off. If he tries to come up to row 8 or 9, he hits his own body or the wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat apple at (3, 9). Secure the top row. From (3, 9), prepare to drop DOWN or LEFT to cut off the center of the board. The opponent is trapped on the right side; we need to turn that trap into a kill.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8)]. I ate that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e Let's check the score... Oh wait, the prompt shows my apples are 2, but I ate one at (3,9). Did I just gain that point? Looking at the board state provided for turn 6, the apple at (3,9) is gone, replaced by my body (indicated by the 0 at (3,9) in the 9th row). However, the scoreboard still says 2 apples. I'll assume I grew but haven't been officially scored yet, or the scoreboard is lagging. Regardless, I am length 3.\n*   **Opponent Position:** Snake #1 is at Head (6, 6), Body [(6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8)]. He is currently length 4.\n*   **Score:** 2 vs 3. I am trailing. I need to be aggressive but calculated.\n*   **The Shift:** The opponent moved UP from (6,7) to (6,6). He is moving deeper into the center. His body is spread vertically on column 6, and his tail is reaching over to column 7.\n\n**Decision Process:**\n\n1.  **Check Safety (From (3, 9)):**\n    *   **UP:** (3, 10). Off the board. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** (3, 8). **My own body!** (The segment at (3,8) is directly behind my head). **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **LEFT:** (2, 9). Open space. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (4, 9). Open space. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves (LEFT vs RIGHT):**\n    *   **LEFT (2, 9):** Moves me to the far left wall. This is a \"safe\" spot, but it's a corner. From (2, 9), my only forward move is effectively right (since down is my body, up is wall, left is wall). This traps me. I want to keep options open. This is a bad long-term play. It cuts me off from the center where the apples and the enemy are.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 9):** Moves me toward the center of the top row. From here, I have access to the top-right area and can drop down into the center. It keeps me in the game.\n\n3.  **Strategy & Interaction:**\n    *   The opponent is at (6, 6). He is looking for apples. There are apples at (7, 6), (5, 1), (8, 3), etc.\n    *   By moving RIGHT to (4, 9), I maintain my presence on the top row and keep the pressure on. I am not trapping myself in a corner.\n    *   I need to watch out for a potential head-on collision next turn. If I go RIGHT to (4, 9), and he moves UP to (6, 7), we are far apart. If he moves RIGHT to (7, 6), he moves away. If he moves LEFT to (5, 6), he moves toward the center.\n    *   Moving RIGHT allows me to eventually drop down and cut off his path to the apples on the left side of the board.\n\n**The Play:**\nI cannot go UP or DOWN (death). LEFT traps me in the corner. **RIGHT** keeps me mobile and in the fight. I need to navigate the top row and look for an opening to dive down and steal apples or block the enemy.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nSecure the top row. Look to drop DOWN or RIGHT from (4, 9) to intercept the opponent or grab the apple at (5, 1) or (4, 4) if I get a clear path. I must force the opponent into a tight spot.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Maybe I can snipe an apple later? (There are no apples on row 9 in the list). It moves me away from my body blockage at (3,9).\n    *   *Cons:* I'm still stuck on the top edge. To get to the center apples, I eventually have to turn down. Staying on the rim limits my maneuverability.\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (4, 8)**\n    *   *Pros:* This is the critical move. From (4,8), I open up the board. I can go LEFT to (3,8) [but careful, that connects to my body], or RIGHT to (5,8), or DOWN further to (4,7).\n    *   Looking at the board state for (4,8): It's directly adjacent to the opponent's body at (6,8) and (7,8) on the right side, and my own body at (3,8) on the left. But (4,8) itself is empty.\n    *   This move brings me closer to the center apples like (4,4), (3,1), and (5,0).\n    *   It positions me to potentially intercept the opponent or cut off his path.\n\n**Strategy & Interaction:**\nThe opponent is at (7,6). He has many body segments trailing vertically at (6,6)-(6,8). If I go DOWN to (4,8), I am establishing a presence in the upper-middle quadrant. I am positioning myself to dive down the middle or flank the left side.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,9), I'm just shifting laterally on the rim. It feels passive. I need to be aggressive and cut off space.\n\n**The Play:**\nGoing **DOWN** to (4, 8) is the power move. It moves me out of the corner and into the game. From there, I can threaten the apples at (4,4) or (5,1). I have to be careful not to run into the opponent's body as I descend, but currently, (4,8) is clear.\n\nLet's drop down and engage!\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nFrom (4,8), I will likely continue DOWN or maybe cut LEFT/RIGHT depending on the opponent's movement. I need to watch where that head at (7,6) goes. If he goes UP, I might meet him in the middle.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

Here\u2019s the read and plan for this moment.\n\n- SAFE options from (7,6): UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5), or RIGHT to (8,6). LEFT to (6,6) would crash into our own neck, so that\u2019s a hard no. No immediate apples on any of these target tiles this turn.\n- Cheese slice: we\u2019re up 4 apples to 2 on the rival. No need to go reckless; we want to pressure and keep our escape routes open. Heading east keeps us off our own body and away from the top-left crowd where he\u2019s parked.\n- Positioning read: pushing RIGHT places us on a clear file toward the eastern side, which is safer and gives more room to weave later. It also sets up potential lines for future traps without boxing ourselves in right now.\n- Opponent vibe: he\u2019s up at (4,9) with a tiny body. No immediate threat of a head-on this turn, so we can press without chasing a collision we\u2019re not ready for.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (8,6) to extend our control of the east side, stay safe, and keep the board open for mid-game cage plays.\n- In the next few turns, look to pick off apples that align with safe corridors (avoid tight dead-ends), then start guiding toward the top-right quadrant where we can pin him along walls and threaten head-on if our apple count keeps climbing.\n- Stay aggressive but calculated: force mistakes by maintaining options and not dunking into his path unless the gain is clear.\n\nLong-term vibe for the next few turns:\n- Grow when safe, ping around the edges to create pseudo-boxes, and pivot to trap attempts if we see him over-committing toward the center. If we keep the score advantage, a well-timed head-on could swing this in our favor.\n\nDecision: RIGHT",

Now let's look at the board and secure the bag!\n\n**BOARD STATE & ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **My Current Position:** Head at (4, 8). Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9)].\n*   **Opponent Position:** Snake #1 Head at (8, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)]. *Note: His tail is at (6, 8), directly to my right.*\n*   **Score:** 2 vs 4. Still trailing. Need apples, but more importantly, need to dominate space.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (4, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP:** (4, 9).\n    *   Is this safe? Yes, it was my tail from the previous turn, but since I just moved down, that cell (4,9) is now the \"neck\" of my body. Wait, looking at my body: I moved from (4,9) to (4,8). My body list is [(4,9), (3,9)].\n    *   If I move UP to (4,9), I am moving into my own body! That's a collision. **DEATH.** \u274c\n2.  **DOWN:** (4, 7).\n    *   My Body: (4,9), (3,9). (4,7) is clear.\n    *   Opponent Body: (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,7) is clear.\n    *   Apples: (4,7) is empty.\n    *   **Safe.** \u2705\n3.  **LEFT:** (3, 8).\n    *   My Body: (4,9), (3,9). (3,8) is clear (adjacent to tail at (3,9), but not the same).\n    *   Opponent Body: (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (3,8) is clear.\n    *   Apples: (3,8) is empty.\n    *   **Safe.** \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT:** (5, 8).\n    *   My Body: (4,9), (3,9). (5,8) is clear.\n    *   Opponent Body: (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). **CRITICAL:** (5,8) is adjacent to (6,8), but it is NOT occupied by the opponent. It is clear.\n    *   Apples: (5,8) is empty.\n    *   **Safe.** \u2705\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nI have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves me toward the center (x=5).\n    *   *Cons:* It places me right next to the opponent's tail at (6,8). If the opponent moves his head up (towards me), we could get into a chase or collision zone. It's aggressive, but risky if he decides to push up into my territory. Also, there are no apples on this row or column immediately available.\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves me left, away from the opponent. Clears the way to potentially drop down the left side of the board where there are apples at (2,6), (3,7), (2,3), (1,0), etc.\n    *   *Cons:* I'm moving back towards my tail slightly, but it's safe.\n*   **Option 3: DOWN to (4, 7):**\n    *   *Pros:* This is the **power move**. It pushes straight down the center column. From (4,7), I have immediate access to the apple at (4,4) and (4,0). It also puts me directly on the path to cut across the middle of the map. It keeps my options open: from (4,7) I can go LEFT to (3,7) (which is an apple!), RIGHT to (5,7), or further DOWN to (4,6).\n    *   *Cons:* None immediately visible. (4,7) is currently empty and safe.\n\n**STRATEGY & PLACEMENT:**\n\nI am on the offensive. The opponent is at (8,6) and (6,8). By going DOWN to (4,7), I am claiming the central column. This is the most valuable real estate on the board. It allows me to pivot left or right to snatch apples or intercept the enemy.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I engage the enemy immediately, but I have a lower score (2 vs 4). If we collide head-on, I lose. I need to grow first.\nIf I go LEFT, I'm safe, but I'm moving away from the dense cluster of apples in the center (4,4, 3,7, 5,1).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nGoing **DOWN** to (4, 7) is the smartest aggressive play. It positions me to go for the apple at (3,7) or (4,4) next turn. It establishes dominance in the center. The opponent is far right; I am center/left. I need to secure the center before he rotates around.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (4,7), I will look to grab the apple at (3,7) or push deeper to (4,4). I need to watch the opponent's head at (8,6). If he goes Left or Up, I need to maintain my center advantage.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN. Let's secure the center!\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9)]. (Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt: My head is actually at **(4,7)** but the prompt says \"Head: (4, 7)\" and the board shows \"0\" at (4,7). However, the \"BOARD STATE\" text shows `7 . . . A 0 . T . . .`. Let's look closer. The prompt says: \"Head: (4, 7)\" and \"Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9)]\". The board shows `0` at (4,7) indeed.\n*   **Opponent Position:** Snake #1 Head at (9, 6). Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)].\n*   **Score:** 2 vs 4.

Moving back UP is valid (it's not \"backwards into my own body\" in the fatal sense because the cell is part of my body, but since I just left it, it's valid... wait, the rules say \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n    *   Let's clarify: If I am at (4,7) and my body is (4,8) and (4,9), then (4,8) is directly behind me. Moving UP to (4,8) is moving into my own body. According to the rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" and specifically \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... That's hitting yourself.

From (4,6), I can continue down to (4,5) and (4,4) where apples are waiting. Good for future pathing.\n    *   *Cons:* Misses the immediate apple at (3,7). I need points now to catch up to the enemy (2 vs 4).\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (3, 7):**\n    *   *Pros:* **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** I eat the apple at (3,7). This brings me to 3 apples, closing the gap. It also places me at (3,7), a great central pivot point to go DOWN next to (3,6) or LEFT to (3,6)/down the pipe.\n    *   *Cons:* None. It's safe and profitable.\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves right.\n    *   *Cons:* No apple. It's a side-step. I need momentum. The enemy is far right at (9,6). Moving right brings me closer to his general quadrant without gaining score. Not ideal.\n\n**STRATEGY & PLACEMENT:**\n\nChat, we are trailing. We need to eat. The apple at (3,7) is right there. Moving **LEFT** is the only play that guarantees growth this turn. Eating an apple increases my length, giving me more board presence and better odds if a head-on collision becomes inevitable (since I have fewer apples, I currently lose head-ons).\n\nBy eating at (3,7), I secure a point and set up a beautiful diagonal path. From (3,7), next turn I can aim for (2,6) or drop down to (3,6) towards (3,1) or (2,3).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**LEFT** to (3, 7). We take the apple. We close the gap. We survive.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (3,7) (with growth), I will likely look to drop DOWN to (3,6) or swing LEFT to (2,7) to set up for the cluster of apples at (2,6), (2,3), etc. I must keep an eye on the enemy at (9,6)\u2014if he starts moving left aggressively, I need to secure the left side first.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT. Grab the apple. Stay hungry.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT would slam into our own neck, and RIGHT is off the board. No brainer there.\n- Why I\u2019m leaning UP: It keeps space on the eastern edge, preserves multiple escape routes, and puts us in a position to pressure the top-right quadrant without tight traps. If the rival tries to swing left toward us, we\u2019ll have a cleaner angle to respond.\n- Why not DOWN right now: It still keeps us alive, but it trades the edge leverage for a slightly more crowded path back toward the center. We\u2019re ahead on apples and can afford to push the play toward the perimeter where we can box more cleanly.\n- Short-term plan: move to the top-right edge, keep options open, and threaten to pin or ambush from the side if the opponent slips into a trap. Maintain a healthy distance to avoid inadvertent head-ons, but be ready to pivot if they chase along the top row.\n- Long-term plan note: use the edge to limit the opponent\u2019s routes and look for a chance to force a head-on with the lead\u2014if/when they collide with your path, you win the exchange. Stay aware of growing your score while avoiding dead-ends.\n\nup",

Let's check the prompt's \"LAST MOVE\" replay. It says I picked **LEFT**. If I moved LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7), my body should be [(4,7), (4,8), (4,9)]. But the prompt says: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (3, 7), Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)]\". This matches! I did move LEFT to (3,7) and ate the apple there (Board shows (3,7) as empty/space in the board state visual, but logic says it's where I am). *Correction:* The board state text shows `7 . . . A 0 .

Wait, the prompt says \"Your snake apples: 3\". The \"LAST RATIONALE\" said \"I eat the apple... brings me to 3 apples\". So I started this turn at 3 apples.\n\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Score:** 4 apples.\n*   **Apples:** (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (2, 2), (8, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (1, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (6, 1), (0, 3), (2, 6), (7, 0), (1, 1)\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From (3, 7)):**\n\n1.  **UP:** (3, 8).\n    *   Board: Row 8 shows ` . . . .

T . . . . .\n        7 . . . 0 T . . . . 1\n        ```\n        It looks like (2,7) is a dot (empty). (3,7) is the '0'. (4,7) is the 'T' (my body). (5,7) is empty?\n    *   My Body: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,7) is clear.\n    *   Enemy Body: (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6).

Moving RIGHT into (4,7) is moving into my own body.\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (3, 8):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves up into a relatively open space.\n    *   *Cons:* I'm already at y=7, close to the top wall. Moving up brings me to y=8, limiting vertical maneuverability. I'm not moving toward any immediate apples (nearest are at (2,6) and (2,3) to the left/down).\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (3, 6):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves toward the central area and apples at (2,6) and (2,3). Opens up the path to (3,5), (3,4) etc.\n    *   *Cons:* Moves away from the top-left quadrant if I wanted to go there (but apples aren't there).\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves toward the cluster of apples on the left side: (2,6), (2,3), (1,1), (0,3). (2,7) is a safe pivot point. From there, I can drop DOWN to (2,6) to eat the apple next turn.\n    *   *Cons:* None immediate.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nThe enemy is at (9,7) on the far right. I am at (3,7). We are essentially on the same horizontal line but far apart.\nMy score is 3, Enemy is 4. I am still trailing but catching up.\nI need to farm apples on the left side (coordinates < 4) because the right side is dominated by the enemy.\nThere is an apple at (2,6). To eat it, I need to be at (2,7) or (3,6) or (2,5) or (1,6).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (2,7), next turn I can go **DOWN** to (2,6) and eat the apple.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (3,6), next turn I can go **LEFT** to (2,6) and eat the apple.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Path A (LEFT->DOWN): (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). This moves me to the left edge (x=2).\n- Path B (DOWN->LEFT): (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (2,6). This keeps me more central (x=3).\n\nSince I want to \"box him in\" and dominate the board, claiming the left side is key. Going **LEFT** to (2,7) establishes a position closer to the left wall, cutting off that area from potential future enemy encroachment (though he's far away). It also lines me up perfectly for the apple at (2,6).\n\n**COMPARISON WITH LAST MOVE:**\nLast turn I went LEFT to eat an apple at (3,7). That worked.\nNow, I need to continue the momentum toward the next target. The cluster at (2,6), (2,3), (1,1) is the next objective.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**LEFT** to (2, 7). This secures the path to the apple at (2, 6) for the next turn. It also keeps me safe and avoids the wall at the top (y=8/9) while keeping options open.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (2,7), I will likely go DOWN to (2,6) to eat the apple. I must check if the enemy moves left/center, but he's currently at (9,7) and likely needs to move left or down to find apples (board shows apples at (8,3) and (7,0) on the right, but those are far down). If he stays right, I own the left.\n\nLEFT",

Limits vertical space.\n    *   Not eating an apple.\n    *   Keeps me near the left side.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (1, 7):**\n    *   Moves further left.\n    *   Not eating an apple immediately.\n    *   Opens up path to apples at (0,3), (1,1), (1,0).\n    *   However, I am currently sitting on a direct path to the apple at (2,6) if I just go DOWN.\n\n*   **Option 3: DOWN to (2, 6):**\n    *   **IMMEDIATE CONTENT:** There is an apple at (2, 6). Eating it brings my score to 4, tying Snake #1!\n    *   **POSITIONING:** (2, 6) is central-left. From there, I have access to apples at (1,1), (2,3), (3,1), etc.\n    *   **SAFETY:** It's safe. The enemy is at (9,8) on the far right. They are no immediate threat to this space.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nThe enemy is at (9,8). They are high up on the right. They are likely hunting apples on the right side (like (8,3) or (7,0)). By moving DOWN to (2,6) and eating that apple, I **TIE THE SCORE (4-4)** and solidify my control of the left/center quadrant.\n\nIf I go UP or LEFT, I waste a turn not eating the apple right in front of me. The enemy might eat an apple on their turn and extend their lead to 5. I cannot let that happen. I must eat this apple now to stay competitive.\n\n**COMPARISON WITH LAST MOVE:**\nLast turn I moved LEFT to (2,7) to set up for this apple. Now it's time to collect the reward.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** to (2, 6). Eat the apple. Tie the game. Secure the territory.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (2,6), I will look to move toward the apple cluster at (1,1) or (2,3). I need to keep the pressure on the enemy. If I tie the score, I can start looking for head-on collision opportunities if I get a lead, or just keep farming while watching the enemy's position.\n\nDOWN",

If he moves DOWN to (8, 8), I can chase him down. If he moves LEFT to (7, 9), he's moving away from the wall but into the open. I want to cut off his space.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (4, 6), I'll likely chase the enemy or grab the apple at (4, 5). I need to force him into a corner where he crashes. I have the length to trap him.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT is instant death.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE MOVE:**\n- **ENEMY MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:** They moved DOWN to (5, 9). They're trying to flee the corner! Their next likely moves: DOWN to (5, 8), LEFT to (4, 9), or RIGHT to (6, 9). \n- **IF I GO RIGHT to (7, 6):** I'm advancing on the right flank, staying on the same row as my body but ahead. This positions me to intercept if they try to escape down the right side. More importantly...\n- **IF I GO UP to (6, 7):** I'd be at (6, 7) - directly below the apple at (5, 8)! That's bait, but also close to the enemy. If they go DOWN to (5, 8), we could have a head-on collision at (5, 8) vs my (6, 7) - no collision. If they go LEFT to (4, 9), no issue.\n- **IF I GO DOWN to (6, 5):** I'm moving toward the center apples but away from the enemy - they could keep escaping.\n\n**TERRITORIAL CONTROL:** The enemy is at (5, 9). I need to cut off their escape routes. By moving RIGHT to (7, 6), I'm maintaining pressure on the right side while keeping options open. Next turn, if they go DOWN to (5, 8), I can cut them off by moving UP to (7, 7) or LEFT to (6, 7) to block. If they go LEFT, I chase.\n\n**PLUS:** (7, 6) gives me access to apples at (8, 3) and (5, 8) later. I'm keeping multiple paths open while dominating the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep the enemy cornered in the top-right. Force them into a situation where every move brings them closer to me. Once I have a score lead, force head-on collision. Stay aggressive.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** RIGHT - maintain right flank pressure and keep options open!\n\nRIGHT",

Their next likely moves: DOWN to (5, 7), LEFT to (4, 8), RIGHT to (6, 8), or UP back to (5, 9).\n- **IF I GO UP to (7, 7):** I'm positioning myself DIRECTLY between them and the bottom! This cuts off their escape route DOWN. From (7, 7), I can attack from multiple angles next turn. Plus...\n- **POSITIONAL ADVANTAGE:** (7, 7) gives me a commanding central position. If they try to go DOWN to (5, 7), I can move LEFT to (6, 7) to cut them off. If they go LEFT to (4, 8), I can chase. If they go RIGHT to (6, 8), I can move LEFT to (6, 7) to intercept.\n- **APPLE ACCESS:** From (7, 7), I have quick access to apples at (8, 5) and (5, 8) (if they don't take it). More importantly, I'm controlling the CENTER of the board!\n- **DEFENSIVE POSITION:** Moving UP keeps me away from my own body (no risk of backward collision) and away from their immediate path. I'm building a wall!\n\n**THE BOX-IN STRATEGY:**\n1. Enemy is at (5, 8) with body at top-right\n2. I move UP to (7, 7) - cutting off the bottom/right flank\n3. Next turn, depending on their move, I can pinch them from LEFT or DOWN\n4. Force them into a corner where they have NO safe moves left!\n5. Once I'm ahead in score, force head-on collision for the win!\n\n**PLUS:** The enemy is already at 5 apples - I need to catch up! From (7, 7), I can pivot to apples quickly while maintaining pressure. This is about DOMINANCE, not just survival!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep the enemy cornered in top-right. Move to central positions that cut off escape routes. Force them into dead-ends. Once I'm ahead, hunt them down for the head-on collision win!\n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP - cut off their escape and take central control! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We're on turn 17/150, score is 5-4 in our favor, and the board is about pressuring the rival into a bad commit.\n\nSafety first, plan second:\n- UP is a hard no: heading into (5,9) would be moving into the cell right behind our head. That\u2019s a 180-degree mess and instant death with this neck orientation.\n- Safe options this turn: DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8), or RIGHT to (6,8). All three are free of any body collision right now.\n- My read: we should apply pressure while keeping multiple safe follow-ups. We don\u2019t want to seal ourselves into a trap; we want to coax him into a mistake or force a mutual collapse if it helps our lead.\n\nWhy DOWN (our chosen line of attack):\n- It edges us toward the rival\u2019s general area (they\u2019re at y=6) without stepping into any risky cross-fire with their current body.\n- It preserves flexible follow-ups: from (5,7) we can pivot to (4,7) or (6,7) next turn, depending on his move, or drop back to (5,6) only if it becomes safe (not likely this turn due to his own position).\n- With a one-apple lead, we can afford to push for a potential head-on clash later if opportunities arise, but not at the cost of immediate death.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 17: move DOWN to (5,7) to shrink his escape options and keep our own lines open.\n- Turn 18: read his choice. If he stays on that zone, squeeze with LEFT or RIGHT to trap him between our growing wall and the edge.\n- Keep an eye on apple timing, but never chase one at the cost of dying to a head-on or running into his body. Our primary aim is to stay alive while reducing his mobility and keeping multiple safe replies.\n\nNow, the move:\ndown",

UP to (8, 7):**\n- Board row 7: `. . . . . 1 . 0 . .` \u2192 (8, 7) is currently empty \u2705\n- My body: (7,6),(6,6)... \u2192 (8, 7) is clear \u2705  \n- Enemy body: (5,8),(5,9)... \u2192 (8, 7) is clear \u2705\n- **BUT WAIT!** Enemy at (5, 7) could move RIGHT to (6, 7) - but that's not a head-on collision with (8, 7).

RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n- Same as UP - (8, 7) is empty \u2705\n- Safe from my body \u2705\n- Safe from enemy body \u2705\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 7), no collision \u2705\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5, 7) with body blocking above and left:\n- They can't go UP (5, 8) is their own body!\n- They can't go LEFT (4, 7) is off-board? No wait, (4, 7) is on board... but is it safe?\n- They can go DOWN to (5, 6)... **BUT WAIT!** (5, 6) is MY BODY! \u274c\n- They can go RIGHT to (6, 7)...\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** If the enemy is smart, they'll go RIGHT to (6, 7) to escape! But if I move LEFT to (6, 7), we BOTH DIE! That's a head-on collision at (6, 7)!\n\n**THE CHOICE:**\n- **LEFT (6, 7):** RISKY - could be head-on collision if enemy moves right\n- **UP/RIGHT (8, 7):** SAFE - no immediate collision risk, maintains distance from enemy\n- **DOWN (7, 6):** SUICIDE - hits my own body\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**\nWe need to stay alive and CONTINUE THE PRESSURE! The enemy is trapped in their corner. If we survive this turn, we can close the gap on apples next turn and maintain our territorial advantage.\n\nFrom (8, 7), we have multiple safe follow-ups. From (6, 7), if we survive, we're closer but potentially boxing ourselves in. Let's keep options open!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep the enemy cornered in the top-right. Survive this turn, then on Turn 19, if they're still trapped, we can move to cut off their remaining escape routes. Once we're ahead in score, we force head-on collision!\n\n**DECISION:** \nAvoid the risky left move. Play it safe with UP or RIGHT to (8, 7).\n\nUP",

It shoves us toward the rival\u2019s zone without crossing into danger, preserves multiple follow-ups, and keeps a potential head-on to KO if the timing lines up.\n- Read on the rival: if he keeps toward the center, we tighten from (4,7); if he tries to dodge, we pivot to trap with a couple safe moves on the next turns.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Turn 18: move LEFT to (4,7) to clamp his options and keep flexible follow-ups (3,7) or (4,8) next.\n- Turn 19+: depending on his choice, push with either UP or LEFT to reduce his space and aim for a favorable head-on if the moment arises.\n\nConfidence level: solid risk-aware aggression.

But what if enemy moves DOWN? They can't - their body blocks (4,7). What if enemy moves UP to (4,9)? Row 9: (4,9) is '.' \u2705 They could go UP!\n\n**3. LEFT to (7, 8):**\n- **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** My own body is at (7, 8)! \u274c\u274c\u274c\n- Cannot move into my own body!\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n- **IMMEDIATE DEATH!** Moving outside board (x=9 is max, but (9,8) is valid? Wait, board goes 0-9, so (9,8) is ON the board! \u2705\n- Row 8: (9,8) is '.'! \u2705\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- Enemy body: all clear \u2705\n- **DANGER:** If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,8)\u2192(6,8) and I move RIGHT to (9,8), no collision. But what if enemy moves UP to (4,9)? That's safe for them. But also, there's an apple at (8,5) and (8,3) - moving RIGHT keeps me away from apples. Not ideal.\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Enemy at (4,8) is in a TERRIBLE position! They have NO safe moves!\n- UP to (4,9): Row 9 shows (4,9) is '.'! \u2705 Wait, let me check again...\n- Row 9: `. . . . . T T . . .` \u2192 (4,9) is actually '.'! So UP is possible.\n- DOWN to (4,7): **BLOCKED by their own body!** \u274c\n- LEFT to (3,8): Row 8 shows (3,8) is '.'! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (5,8): **BLOCKED by their own body!** \u274c\n\nEnemy has TWO safe moves: UP to (4,9) or LEFT to (3,8).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nIf I move UP to (8, 9), I:\n1. Stay SAFE \u2705\n2. Position myself at the top-right corner\n3. If enemy moves UP to (4,9), we're far apart and no collision\n4. If enemy moves LEFT to (3,8), still no collision\n5. From (8,9), I can then move LEFT or DOWN toward apples\n\nBut wait - moving UP to (8,9) puts me in the corner. From there, I'd have fewer options next turn. Not ideal.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7), I:\n1. Stay SAFE \u2705\n2. Get closer to apples at (8,5) and (8,3) - STRATEGIC!\n3. Maintain position near the right edge\n4. Keep options open for next turn (can go DOWN further or LEFT)\n5. From (8,7), if enemy goes UP to (4,9) or LEFT to (3,8), no collision\n\n**THE WIN CONDITION:**\nI'm behind 4-5. I need to eat an apple to tie or take the lead! The apple at (8,5) is just 2 squares DOWN from my current position. Moving DOWN to (8,7) puts me on track to grab that apple next turn!\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN to (8, 7) - it's safe, gets me closer to the apple at (8,5), and keeps my future options wide open! Let's hunt that apple and tie up the score!\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** \nMove DOWN again to (8,6) next turn, then DOWN to (8,5) to eat the apple and tie the score 5-5! From there, I'll dominate the right side and force the enemy into a trap!\n\nDOWN",

If I go Left, I stay safer but lose the chance to apply immediate pressure.\n\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN: Push toward the board center with disciplined spacing, watch his moves, and look for a crossing or confinement pivot on the next couple turns. Maintain at least two safe follow-ups each turn to avoid traps and keep him uncertain.\n\n- LONG-TERM NOTE: If I can corral him into a narrowing corridor between my new position and the edge, I can force more head-on or forced moves, especially as apples flood the board. Keep pressure, avoid corner pits, and punish any misstep.\n\nDOWN",

UP to (6, 6):**\n- Board: Row 6 shows (6, 6) is '.'! \u2705\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- Enemy body: all clear \u2705\n- **MOBILITY:** From (6, 6), I can go: UP to (6, 7) \u2705, DOWN to (6, 5) \u2705, LEFT to (5, 6) \u2705, RIGHT to (7, 6) \u2705. FOUR options! MAXIMUM FREEDOM!\n- **POSITIONING:** Controls the upper-middle! Perfect to cut off enemy's escape routes.\n\n**2. DOWN to (6, 4):**\n- Board: Row 4 shows (6, 4) is '.'! \u2705\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- Enemy body: all clear \u2705\n- **MOBILITY:** From (6, 4), I can go: UP to (6, 5) \u2705, DOWN to (6, 3) \u2705, LEFT to (5, 4) \u2705, RIGHT to (7, 4) \u2705.

FOUR options!\n- **OFFENSIVE:** Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 4) - just one step away! Also gets me deeper into the center zone.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n- Board: Row 5 shows (7, 5) is '.'! \u2705\n- My body: (7, 5) is my SECOND SEGMENT! Moving into my own body! \u274c **DEATH!** I'd be hitting myself. CUT THIS IMMEDIATELY!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have THREE safe moves, each with FOUR follow-up options!\n\n**Option 1: UP to (6, 6)**\n- **POSITIONING:** Controls the upper-middle. The enemy is at (2, 7) and can move DOWN to (2, 6) or LEFT to (1, 7). If I go UP, I'm positioned to cut them off if they try to cross through the center!\n- **OFFENSIVE:** From (6, 6), I can pivot to chase apples or trap the enemy. Maximum flexibility!\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (6, 4)**\n- **POSITIONING:** Moves toward bottom-center. Good for apple hunting.\n- **RISK:** The enemy might be moving toward the apple cluster at (4, 4) and (5, 4) as well. Could lead to a head-on collision or race for apples.\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (5, 5)**\n- **POSITIONING:** Deep into the center zone! This is AGGRESSIVE positioning.\n- **OFFENSIVE:** Just one move from the apple at (5, 4)! If I go LEFT now and the enemy moves DOWN, I might be able to force a collision on the next turn!\n- **DEFENSIVE:** From (5, 5), I'm also positioned to cut off the enemy's routes through the center!\n\n**THE WIN CONDITION:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 7) with body going up to (2, 9) and right to (4, 8). They're in the top-left corner. If I can box them in from the center, they'll be forced to crash!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 25: LEFT to (5, 5) - deep center control, threatens apple at (5,4)\nTurn 26: If enemy moves DOWN to (2, 6), I chase to force collision. If they move LEFT to (1, 7), I chase to trap!\nTurn 27+: Continue closing the net! The enemy has limited space - they can't escape the top-left corner forever!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT to (5, 5) is the POWER MOVE! I'm entering the danger zone to control the board center and set up the trap! The enemy thinks they're safe in their corner, but I'm coming for them! Let's force this collision and WIN this game! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019ve got three safe options: DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), or RIGHT to (3,7). UP is illegal (hits my neck).\n\n- Why not UP: that would be a direct back-into-my-neck crash. Not happening.\n- Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. All avoid walls and enemy bodies for now.\n- Down vs Left vs Right:\n  - DOWN (2,6): stays center-ish, closes distance to the rival, keeps multiple safe follow-ups (2,5 / 3,6 / 1,6). Keeps flexibility to swing toward the enemy and potentially trap later.\n  - LEFT (1,7): pulls away from the center and the rival a bit, gives more room to maneuver but less pressure now.\n  - RIGHT (3,7): nudges toward the center-right; quicker pressure on the path toward the opponent, but future options get a bit more constrained as we creep closer to the enemy\u2019s flame-front.\n\n- Risk/score note: both teams at 5 apples. Head-on collisions are risky because a mutual KO would be a draw unless someone secures a later apple lead. Best play is to pressure and create a tightening corridor while staying alive.\n\n- Long-term plan: push into a central corridor to box him when the board density of apples grows; keep at least two safe follow-ups each turn to avoid diagonal traps and keep him guessing.\n\nShort verdict: DOWN looks strongest to pressure the center while preserving future options.\n\nDOWN",

FOUR OPTIONS! \ud83d\udcaf\n- **OFFENSIVE:** I EAT THIS APPLE TOO! Score becomes 6-5! Also moves me LEFT, closer to enemy's vertical column. Could be aggressive!\n\n**4. RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n- Board: (6, 5) is '.' \u2705\n- **DEATH TRAP:** (6, 5) is my SECOND BODY SEGMENT! Moving into myself! \u274c\n- **RESULT:** INSTANT DEATH!

They're NOT threatening this apple.\n- **FUTURE:** From (5, 4) I have access to more apples in the center-left area and can start closing the net.\n\n**OPTION B: LEFT to (4, 5)**\n- **POSITIONING:** Move LEFT into the center-left, eat apple there.\n- **ENEMY LOCATION:** Enemy is at (2, 6) - JUST TWO STEPS LEFT! If they move RIGHT on next turn to (3, 6), we could be on a collision course!\n- **FUTURE:** From (4, 5) I'm CLOSER to the enemy's position. This is the aggressive play to BOX THEM IN! The enemy's body is vertical at (2,6)-(2,9).

Going LEFT gives us:\n1. **Apple collection** \u2705\n2. **Aggressive positioning** - we're moving TOWARD the enemy's zone\n3. **Board control** - we occupy center-left, potentially blocking enemy's rightward escape\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT to (4, 5)! \ud83c\udfaf I'm taking the apple AND moving toward the enemy! This is the AGGRESSIVE play! Let's force them to make a mistake as we close the net! The enemy thinks they're safe in their vertical line, but I'm coming to CRUSH them from the center!

The enemy is at (3, 6) now - they moved RIGHT into our potential path! They're playing aggressive too!\n\nLet's break down this turn from my head at (4, 5):\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (4, 5) \n- **My Body:** [(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 6) - MOVED RIGHT! They're pushing toward center!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)] - Still vertical on the left\n- **My Score:** 6 apples \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Enemy Score:** 5 apples\n\n**SAFETY ANALYSIS FROM (4, 5):**\n\n**1. UP to (4, 6):**\n- Board: (4, 6) is '.' \u2705\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- Enemy body: (3, 6) is enemy HEAD, not body \u2705\n- **RISK:** Enemy head at (3, 6) is adjacent! If they move RIGHT to (4, 6) while I move UP to (4, 6)... HEAD-ON COLLISION! We both die! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **MOBILITY:** From (4, 6) I have: UP (4, 7) \u2705, DOWN (4, 5) \u2705, LEFT (3, 6) \u2705, RIGHT (5, 6) \u2705. But (3, 6) has enemy head right now! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**2. DOWN to (4, 4):**\n- Board: (4, 4) shows 'A' - APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- Enemy body: all clear \u2705\n- **SAFETY:** Enemy head at (3, 6) can't reach (4, 4) this turn - too far! \u2705\n- **MOBILITY:** From (4, 4) I have: UP (4, 5) \u2705, DOWN (4, 3) \u2705, LEFT (3, 4) \u2705, RIGHT (5, 4) \u2705. ALL CLEAR! \ud83d\udcaf\n- **OFFENSIVE:** I EAT THE APPLE! Score becomes 7-5! We extend our lead! This also moves me DOWN, away from the enemy's immediate path.\n\n**3. LEFT to (3, 5):**\n- Board: (3, 5) is '.' \u2705\n- My body: all clear \u2705\n- **DEATH TRAP:** (3, 5) is RIGHT NEXT to enemy head at (3, 6)! If they move DOWN to (3, 5)... we collide! Or if they move DOWN and I move LEFT... wait, enemy at (3, 6), body starts at (2, 6). \n- **ACTUAL RISK:** If enemy moves DOWN to (3, 5) and I move LEFT to (3, 5)... HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **POSITIONING:** Also puts me directly in line with their vertical body column.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n- Board: (5, 5) is my FIRST BODY SEGMENT! Moving into myself! \u274c\n- **RESULT:** INSTANT DEATH! Don't throw! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION - PLAY IT SAFE WITH THE LEAD!**\n\nI have a 6-5 LEAD! Why risk a head-on collision when I'm already winning?\n\n**OPTION A: DOWN to (4, 4) \ud83c\udfc6**\n- **OFFENSIVE:** I EAT THE APPLE! Score 7-5! We extend the lead to 2 points!\n- **SAFETY:** Enemy can't reach me this turn. No collision risk.\n- **POSITIONING:** I move DOWN to the center-right, staying clear of their vertical column on the left.\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm securing the apple-rich bottom center, giving me more future options while the enemy is stuck on the left side.\n\n**OPTION B: UP to (4, 6) \u26a0\ufe0f**\n- High risk of HEAD-ON COLLISION with enemy at (3, 6) if they move right!\n- Why gamble my lead? I'm 2 apples ahead of the enemy!\n\n**OPTION C: LEFT to (3, 5) \u26a0\ufe0f**\n- Also high collision risk with enemy at (3, 6)!\n- Moves me INTO their danger zone!\n\n**THE WIN CONDITION:**\nWith a 7-5 lead, I'm in a commanding position! The enemy needs to eat TWO apples just to catch up, and they're trapped on the left side with their vertical body limiting their movement. I have a path to more apples in the center-right and bottom right.\n\n**LONG-TERM AGGRESSION PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (4, 4), extend the lead to 7-5, then start closing in from the right while the enemy is stuck on the left. Force them into a corner!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN to (4, 4)! \ud83c\udf4e We take the apple, extend the lead, and play it SMART! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

From (3,3), I can cut off their escape routes and force them into walls!\n\n**LONG-TERM AGGRESSION PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3,3) to get to 8-5, then continue pressuring left/up to cut off the enemy's escape. They're already cornered at the top-left - I just need to keep the pressure on while collecting more apples! I'm building a lead while simultaneously boxing them in!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT to (3, 3)! \ud83c\udf4e\u2694\ufe0f We take the apple, extend the lead to 3 points, and move INTO ENEMY TERRITORY to start boxing them in!

They have limited moves. But I need to stay focused on MY survival and growth.\n\n**OPTION A: DOWN to (3, 2) \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6**\n- **MASSIVE OFFENSIVE:** I EAT AN APPLE! Score becomes 9-5! That's a 4-point lead!\n- **SAFETY:** Moves me AWAY from the enemy entirely - they're at top, I'm going bottom!\n- **POSITIONING:** From (3,2) I can access multiple apples at bottom: (1,0), (5,0), (4,0), (6,1), (7,0), (1,1)!\n- **MOBILITY:** All 4 directions clear from (3,2) - maximum flexibility!\n- **FUTURE:** I can continue collecting apples while the enemy gets trapped!\n\n**OPTION B: LEFT to (2, 3) \u2694\ufe0f**\n- I eat an apple (9-5), but I'm moving INTO enemy territory\n- Enemy is at (3,9) and might move DOWN toward me\n- Could set up a head-on collision if they chase apples down there\n- **RISK:** While safe this turn, I'm positioning myself in an area where the enemy might move toward\n\n**OPTION C: UP to (3, 4) \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f**\n- No apple, no growth\n- Moves me CLOSER to enemy\n- Only 3 safe directions available from (3,4)\n- **BAD:** Don't chase the enemy when I have a lead!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\nI'm up 8-5. The smart play is to **EXTEND THE LEAD** while **STAYING SAFE**. The enemy is cornered at the top - let them stay cornered! I'll dominate the bottom of the board where there are MULTIPLE apples waiting.\n\nBy moving DOWN to (3, 2):\n- I EAT an apple \u2192 9-5 lead!\n- I get AWAY from enemy territory\n- I open up the bottom half of the board for collection\n- Maximum mobility and safety\n- Enemy has limited options at top-left corner\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\"Let the enemy corner themselves while I feast on the bottom! Keep the 4-point lead and don't risk head-on collisions.

UP is off-board, LEFT would slam into your neck at (3,9).\n- I\u2019m choosing DOWN to (4,8) as the primary move.\n\nReasoning and plan:\n- Safety first: DOWN and RIGHT are both safe; DOWN keeps you away from the top edge trap risk and avoids tangling with your own neck. It also preserves a clear escape route to the right in future turns.\n- Space preservation: Dropping down a notch creates a gentle vertical corridor you can use to funnel space for future maneuvers, reducing the chance of getting boxed in prematurely.\n- Aggressive posture without reckless risk: By stepping down, you stay near the top edge but begin a slow, controlled shift toward the board\u2019s center, where you can pivot toward the opponent if he overextends.\n- Head-on avoidance: The rival\u2019s head is far from your immediate path; keeping busy in the upper/mid area minimizes exposure to sudden head-on clashes in the next few turns.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3-5 turns):\n- Maintain two safe follow-ups: continue DOWN if the corridor remains clear, or pivot RIGHT to press toward the top-right zone where you can threaten a squeeze later.\n- Watch the opponent\u2019s positioning: if he drifts toward your right, look for a chance to create a narrow passage that could force a head-on if you both advance, but only if it\u2019s safe.\n- Do not chase apples aggressively yet; prioritize staying alive and shaping space.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Build a lattice-like barrier along the top region and a rising corridor from (4,8) downward to try to corral him into a shrinking dead end. If you can force a high-score trade or a favorable head-on when you\u2019re safer, you\u2019ll leverage your apples lead.\n\nFinal move:\ndown",

It preserves future options, keeps us in open space, and sets up a clean route to the apple at (0,8) on the next turn without risking a head-on or self-collision.\n- If the apple at (0,8) becomes contested or the opponent overextends, we can adapt, but for now UP is the safest aggressive play that maintains long-term options.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Stay flexible, stay out of tight corridors, and lure the opponent into lines where a controlled head-on favors us only when apples are in our favor.\n- Use space to force favorable collisions rather than chasing every apple; score gap matters, so we stay mobile and patient.\n\nFinal move cue:\nUP",

Still a viable contingency if the opportunity to box him arises later.\n- RIGHT to (2,8) stays in the open, but doesn\u2019t gain immediate space or a scoring apple; it\u2019s a fine safe play, just less aggressive than Up.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Stay mobile in the top-left quadrant, using open space to dodge any chase from Snake 0.\n- If the opponent overreaches toward the center, threaten a controlled head-on only when we\u2019ve got a clear apples-to-safety advantage.\n- Prioritize safety first, then leverage apples to tilt the score and unlock aggressive play when it\u2019s favorable.\n\nFinal move cue:\nUP\n\nUP",

We\u2019re 41/150, behind on apples (6 vs 14), so our mission is aggressive but surgical: box the advantage, eat on the edge, and force mistakes. Let\u2019s run the read.\n\nMove options from head (0,9):\n- UP: off the board (dead) \u2014 not an option.\n- LEFT: off the board (dead) \u2014 not an option.\n- RIGHT: (1,9) sits on our own neck cell. If the neck moves away, it could be safe, but it\u2019s a tight squeeze and gives no immediate apple. Not ideal for the risk-reward.\n- DOWN: (0,8) is an apple cell. It\u2019s safe (not colliding with any body right now) and it immediately grows us, plus it keeps us hugging the left edge where those apples cluster (0,8 already eaten, next targets 0,4 and 0,3).\n\nWhy DOWN beats RIGHT here:\n- Immediate growth and a guaranteed apple this turn.\n- Keeps a long, open corridor along x=0 to maneuver and threaten the lower-left apple set without getting boxed in by the opponent\u2019s body prematurely.\n- RIGHT would keep us near the neck, riskier long-term with no growth this turn, and doesn\u2019t set up a clean edge-path for future turns.\n\nLong-term plan (for your future self):\n- Stack down the left edge: move (0,9) -> (0,8) (eat), then (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), then hit (0,4) to grab that apple and keep the tail from looping near the bottom. This creates a long, safe corridor that limits opponent\u2019s access to the same space and buys us room to pivot if they try to swing toward the left.\n- Avoid the bottom cluster for now (the opponent\u2019s braid near y=0\u20131). We don\u2019t want a surprise collide on the bottom edge. Stay in the upper-left quadrant until we have a few more apples under our belt.\n- Keep eyes on any head-on opportunities only if we have a clear apples-lead swing; with 6 vs 14, we\u2019re hoping for a misstep rather than a direct clash.\n\nPlay-by-play vibe:\n- We\u2019re taking the apple and locking onto the left edge. If the opponent threads downward, we\u2019ll stay patient, force them into a corner later, and push our advantage in a controlled way. The board is 10x10; precision and patience beat reckless dash moves here.\n\nFinal move choice:\nDOWN",

Also keeps us away from a reverse-head collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: maintain the left corridor, bait him toward the center then pin him to a wall, and aim to convert lower apple gains into a space advantage while avoiding risky head-ons since we trail in apples (7 vs 16).\n\nCurrent move plan: DOWN to extend the vertical lane and set up potential future squeezes.\n\nDOWN",

We need to maintain our dominant position and be ready to close this out if they get close!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **CURRENT POSITION:** My head is at (8, 6). I'm deep on the right side. The enemy head is at (3, 3), trying to move up toward the top left corner.\n\n2. **IMMEDIATE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP to (8, 7):** Empty! (Row 7 shows \". . . . . . . . A A\" - (8,7) is '.'). From (8,7), I can go UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). (8,8) is empty (Row 8 col 8 is '.'). (9,7) is empty (Row 7 col 9 is 'A' - wait, actually (9,7) is 'A' based on apple drops! But that's a good apple to chase!). **MOBILITY: 4 options!**\n   - **DOWN to (8, 5):** Empty! (Row 5 shows \". . A . A T . . . .\" - (8,5) is '.'). From (8,5), I can go UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5). (8,4) is empty (Row 4 col 8 is '.'). (9,5) is empty (Row 5 col 9 is '.'). **MOBILITY: 4 options!**\n   - **LEFT to (7, 6):** Empty! (Row 6 col 7 is '.'). From (7,6), I can go UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6). All are empty! **MOBILITY: 4 options!**\n   - **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Empty! (Row 6 col 9 is '.'). From (9,6), I can go UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5), LEFT (8,6). (9,7) is 'A' (apple!), (9,5) is empty, (8,6) is empty. **MOBILITY: 3 options!** (Right edge reduces options)\n\n3. **ELIMINATE DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n   - All four moves are safe! No immediate death.\n   - **RIGHT to (9,6)** is interesting - it's on the edge, but has an apple at (9,7) above it. However, being on the edge is risky long-term.\n   - **UP to (8,7)** is solid - moves me toward the apple at (9,7) but keeps me central.\n   - **LEFT to (7,6)** returns me to a previous position, which is fine but doesn't gain ground.\n   - **DOWN to (8,5)** moves away from the top-right apples.\n\n4. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - The enemy is at (3,3) moving up. They're still far away and trapped on the left.\n   - I want to position myself to either:\n     a) Chase the apple at (9,7) or (9,8) to extend my lead\n     b) Maintain central position to intercept if they try to cross\n   - Going **UP to (8,7)** is perfect because:\n     - It's empty and safe\n     - From (8,7), next turn I can go RIGHT to (9,7) for the apple!\n     - It keeps me off the edge while moving toward valuable apples\n     - It maintains 4 exit options\n\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n   \"Turn 50: Move UP to (8,7) to position for apple (9,7) next turn. Keep enemy trapped left. If they approach center, prepare for head-on collision with our 7-point lead. Dominate right side, maintain mobility. 150 turns total - we're 1/3 done but have huge advantage!\"\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**UP to (8, 7)** is the move! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**WHY UP?**\n- **SAFE & OPEN!** 4 follow-up moves available\n- **POSITIONING!** Sets up for apple at (9,7) next turn\n- **BOARD CONTROL!** Maintains dominance of right side\n- **MOBILITY!** Keeps options wide open for next moves\n- **AGGRESSIVE!** We're hunting apples while keeping enemy cornered!\n\nUP",

We're LIVE in a spicy 2-snake duel on a 10x10 grid, and the chess game is heating up. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nOptions this turn from head (3,3):\n- UP to (3,4) \u2014 safe\n- DOWN to (3,2) \u2014 safe\n- LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 DEADLY bump into our own neck (avoid!)\n- RIGHT to (4,3) \u2014 safe and tasty lane toward center\n\nWhy RIGHT? It opens the cleanest line toward apples without forcing us into a tight trap. It also keeps two clean escape routes (Up and Right) for steady maneuvering, and it nudges us toward the apple at (5,3 that\u2019s ripe for the taking next turn). Our opponent is parked up near (8,6) with most space on the right, so slicing into the middle-right gives us room to box and still chase those apples. Plus, it minimizes risk of a head-on collision since they\u2019re far away and moving away from our immediate vicinity.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (4,3) this turn.\n- On the next move, aim for (5,3) to grab that apple and extend length while staying clear of their current body. Maintain Up and Right as viable follow-ups to dodge any sudden pressure.\n\nRisk checks:\n- No immediate collision with opponent\u2019s body on this path.\n- No out-of-bounds risk with RIGHT.\n- We\u2019ve still got safe rear exits if they pivot; we don\u2019t want to trap ourselves in a corner.\n\nLong-term strategy note for the next few turns:\n- Use the center-right corridor to threaten the (5,3) apple and keep options open for apple farming while avoiding a boxed-in cage from our own trailing body.\n- If we can snag two mid-board apples quickly, we gain momentum to force favorable trades or even a controlled head-on if the math tilts in our favor.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm right in the sweet spot of the top-right quadrant.\n   - Enemy head: (4, 3) - still far away, trapped by their own body and wall.\n   - Enemy's body is blocking their path upward - they're stuck on the left side!\n\n2. **IMMEDIATE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP to (8, 8):** Empty! (Row 8 shows \"T . . . . . . . A A\" - (8,8) is 'A' - AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). From (8,8), I can go UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8).

That's also +1 point!\n\n4. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - We have TWO apples adjacent: (8,8) and (9,7), and another at (9,8) right after.\n   - Enemy is completely bottled up on the left side. Their body forms a wall - they can't get to the center or right side!\n   - With 18-11 lead, I should be hunting apples to extend the gap even further.\n   - Both apple moves are equally good, but **UP to (8,8)** keeps me further from the edge and gives me better long-term mobility.\n   - From (8,8), I can go RIGHT to (9,8) next turn for ANOTHER apple!\n\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n   \"Turn 51: Take the apple at (8,8)! Get that bread! Enemy is TRAPPED left - they're just spinning in circles while we dominate the top-right. With this apple, we hit 19-11. After (8,8), next move RIGHT to (9,8) for apple #20. Then we can swing left or down to keep options open. We're building an INSURMOUNTABLE lead while keeping perfect mobility. 99 turns left - let's get to 30 before they even see the center!\"\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**UP to (8, 8)** is the move! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WHY UP?**\n- **FREE POINT!** Landed on apple at (8,8) \u2192 19 apples! \ud83d\ude80\n- **DOUBLE THREAT!** From (8,8), RIGHT to (9,8) is another apple!\n- **BOARD CONTROL!** Staying in top-right where we own the board\n- **MOBILITY!** Still 4 exit options, don't get trapped\n- **STRATEGIC DOMINATION!** Enemy is stuck left while we feast right! \n\nUP",

Time to keep the momentum rolling and hunt for more!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **CURRENT POSITION:** My head is at (8,8) - I just ate that apple! My body stretches down to (8,7), (8,6), etc. Enemy is still at (5,3) on the left side, completely trapped by their own body and the wall. They're basically stuck in a corner spinning out!\n\n2. **IMMEDIATE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP to (8,9):** EMPTY! (Top row shows \"T T . . . . . . . .\"). From (8,9), I can go DOWN (8,8), LEFT (7,9), or RIGHT (9,9). **MOBILITY: 3 options!**\n   - **DOWN to (8,7):** That's my own body! I'd be moving BACKWARDS into myself! DEAD! \u274c\n   - **LEFT to (7,8):** EMPTY! (Row 8 shows \"T . . . . . . . 0 A\" - (7,8) is '.'). From (7,8), I can go UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), or RIGHT (8,8). **MOBILITY: 4 options!**\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8):** APPLE! (Row 8 col 9 is 'A'). From (9,8), I can go UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8). **MOBILITY: 3 options!** (Right edge but we're hunting!)\n\n3. **ELIMINATE DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n   - **DOWN** is SUICIDE! I'd hit my own body at (8,7)!\n   - **UP, LEFT, RIGHT** are all safe!\n\n4. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8)** gets me ANOTHER APPLE! That's +1 point, my 20th apple! 20-12 lead!\n   - **LEFT to (7,8)** keeps me deeper in the board with better mobility (4 options vs 3).\n   - **UP to (8,9)** puts me at the top edge but still safe.\n   - With 20-12 lead, I should be hunting apples! The enemy is TRAPPED left - they can't reach the right side apples at all!\n   - Plus, from (9,8), I can go UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7) next turn - both potentially available.\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8)** is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY! Extend lead to 20-12 and keep the pressure on!\n\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n   \"Turn 52: Take the apple at (9,8)! We're hitting 20 apples and leaving Snake #1 in the dust at 12! Enemy is completely bottled up on the left - they can't move past their own body wall. After (9,8), we'll either go UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7) depending on board state. We're building an UNSTOPPABLE lead while keeping perfect position in the top-right. 98 turns left - we can hit 30 apples easy if we keep this up! The enemy is basically playing snake in a phone booth while we're running the whole board!\"\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**RIGHT to (9, 8)** is the move! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WHY RIGHT?**\n- **FREE POINT!** Landed on apple at (9,8) \u2192 20 apples! \ud83d\ude80\n- **BOARD DOMINANCE!** Enemy is stuck left - we own the right side!\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** Extend lead to 20-12 and keep the pressure ON!\n- **SECURE POSITION!** Even at the edge, we have multiple exit options!\n- **MENTAL WARFARE!** Snake #1 is watching us feast while they're trapped! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

My body stretches: (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). Enemy still at (5,2) on the left side - they haven't moved much!\n\n2. **IMMEDIATE MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n   - **UP to (9,9):** EMPTY! (Row 9 shows \"T . . . . . . . . .\"). From (9,9), I can go DOWN (9,8), LEFT (8,9). **MOBILITY: 2 options** (corner - limited!)\n   - **DOWN to (9,7):** APPLE! (Row 7 col 9 is 'A'). From (9,7), I can go UP (9,8), DOWN (9,6), LEFT (8,7). **MOBILITY: 3 options!**\n   - **LEFT to (8,8):** MY OWN BODY! (8,8) is in my body list. That's moving BACKWARDS! DEAD! \u274c\n   - **RIGHT:** OFF THE BOARD! I'm already at x=9 (right edge). DEAD! \u274c\n\n3. **ELIMINATE DANGEROUS MOVES:**\n   - **LEFT** is SUICIDE! I'd hit my own body at (8,8)!\n   - **RIGHT** is OFF THE BOARD! I'm at the edge!\n   - **UP** and **DOWN** are safe!\n\n4. **STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n   - **DOWN to (9,7)** gets me ANOTHER APPLE! That's +1 point, my 21st apple! 21-12 lead!\n   - **UP to (9,9)** puts me in the top-right corner with only 2 exit options (LEFT and DOWN). That's risky if the board gets crowded!\n   - From (9,7), I have 3 options including DOWN to (9,6) which might have apples or open space.\n   - With 20-12 lead, I should keep hunting apples! The enemy is TRAPPED left - they can't reach the right side apples!\n   - **DOWN to (9,7)** is the SMART PLAY! Better mobility AND another apple!\n\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n   \"Turn 53: Take the apple at (9,7)! We're hitting 21 apples and leaving Snake #1 in the dust at 12! Enemy is completely bottled up on the left - they're running out of space. After (9,7), we can either go DOWN to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,7) depending on what's available. We're building an UNSTOPPABLE lead while keeping perfect position in the top-right. 97 turns left - we can hit 30+ apples easy if we keep this up! The enemy is basically playing snake in a closet while we're running the whole board! TIME TO CLOSE OUT THE GAME!\"\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**DOWN to (9, 7)** is the move! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WHY DOWN?**\n- **FREE POINT!** Landed on apple at (9,7) \u2192 21 apples! \ud83d\ude80\n- **BETTER MOBILITY!** 3 exit options vs 2 in the corner!\n- **BOARD DOMINANCE!** Enemy is stuck left - we own the right side!\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** Extend lead to 21-12 and keep the pressure ON!\n- **SECURE POSITION!** From (9,7) we can keep hunting or retreat if needed!\n\nDOWN",

Not an option.\n- RIGHT would smack into the enemy body at (6,2) \u2192 dead.\n- DOWN is a wild gamble: (5,1) is currently part of Snake #0\u2019s body. If they don\u2019t move it, we die; if they move away, maybe safe, but too risky.\n- LEFT to (4,2) is clean and keeps options open. \ud83e\udded\n\nDecision: we take the safe LEFT and stay alive, with space to maneuver and pressure later. \u2694\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan: move to (4,2), stay flexible, avoid boxed-in traps, and pressure the rival when opportunities arise. Keep an eye on apple timing but don\u2019t risk self-destructing for a quick bite.\n\nLong-term plan: thread a path that nudges Snake #0 toward the left edge, building indirect confinement too.

Time to keep the pressure ON! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n\n**My Position:** Head at (9,4), Body snakes down the right edge and across the bottom. I've got a massive long body! Looking at my last move DOWN to (9,4) - I grabbed that apple! Now let's see what's available from (9,4):\n\n**From (9,4) - OPTIONS:**\n- **UP to (9,5):** My own body! That's hitting myself backwards - DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** According to the board, row 3 col 9 shows \"A\" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** Let me check the board... row 4 col 8 shows \"A\" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n- **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD! Can't go to x=10! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4)\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** According to the board state, (9,3) is \"A\" - an apple! This would give me +1 apple and extend my lead to 23-13. But let me double-check the board... row 3 col 9 shows \"A\" with a period after, but that's position (9,3). Yes, apple there!\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** Also an apple according to the board state (row 4 col 8 shows \"A\"). This would also give me +1 apple and extend my lead to 23-13.\n\n**THE PLAN:** Both moves give me an apple and grow my lead! I need to consider future positioning. The enemy is still trapped in the left side. From (9,3) I'd have LEFT (8,3) or DOWN (9,2) or RIGHT (off board). From (8,4) I'd have UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), or LEFT (7,4).\n\nLooking at the board, (8,3) appears to be empty based on the board state. (9,2) shows \"A A\" according to the board - so there's an apple there too! From (9,3) I'd be positioned to potentially get that apple next turn.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board state more carefully. Looking at row 4: \"T . A . . T T . A 0\" - position (8,4) is \"A\", position (9,4) is \"0\" (my head). Row 3: \"T T T T T T T . A .\" - position (9,3) is the last character which is \".\" not \"A\". Wait, let me recount: positions 0-9: 0:T,1:T,2:T,3:T,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:.,8:A,9:. So (9,3) is actually \".\" not \"A\".\n\n**CORRECTED ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (9,3):** Actually empty (.) - SAFE but no apple\n- **LEFT to (8,4):** HAS AN APPLE (A) - SAFE and gets food!\n\n**THE DECISION IS CLEAR!** LEFT to (8,4) gives me an apple! That's CONTENT and extends my lead to 23-13! I'm maintaining my massive advantage and keeping the pressure on the enemy who's stuck in their box.\n\n**LEFT",

My own body! \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN to (8,3):** Row 3 col 8 shows \"A\" - ANOTHER APPLE! SAFE! (position (8,3) has apple)\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Row 4 col 7 shows \"T\" - MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD\n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Row 4 col 9 shows \"T\" - MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** ONLY DOWN to (8,3)! That's it! It's forced!\n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINATION:**\nThis is PERFECT! The enemy (Snake #1) is still stuck in their little box on the left side. They're at (1,1) surrounded by my body. I'm about to get ANOTHER apple at (8,3) and extend to 24-13! \n\nI'm literally boxing them in from the RIGHT side while they're trapped. They can't escape! They're forced to move in their little prison. Once I eat this apple, I'll be positioned at (8,3) where I can see the entire left side of the board. The enemy is DONE! \n\n**THE PLAN:** Move DOWN to (8,3), grab that apple, extend my lead to 24-13, and maintain complete board control. The enemy is already cornered - this is just tightening the noose! Next turn I'll be at (8,3) with eyes on the rest of the apples and the enemy trapped in their tiny cell. \n\nLET'S GOOOOO! Time to secure the bag and secure the win! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**DOWN**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Now I need to plan my next move to keep the pressure on.  \n\n**ANALYSIS FROM (8,3):**  \n- **UP to (8,4):** Row 4 col 8 is \"T\" (my body from last move: [(8,4), (9,4)...]). DEAD!  \n- **DOWN to (8,2):** Row 2 col 8 shows \"A\" (apple at (8,2)!

Since my body is continuous from (9,4) to (9,8), (9,3) might be clear, but the \"T\" suggests it's occupied. To be safe, avoid.  \n\n**BEST MOVE:** DOWN to (8,2) is SAFE and grabs an apple, extending my lead to 25-13! This also positions me near the center-right, keeping options open. Enemy is still stuck in their box at (0,1), so no immediate threat.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (8,2), I'll be at (8,2) with body extending behind. Next, I can move LEFT or DOWN to control more space, but avoid backing into myself. Goal: keep boxing in enemy while growing safely.  \n\n**DOWN**",

Opponent head at (8,3) with a long trail ending at (1,0). Apples are live all over and the score is You: 13, Opp: 24.

DOWN looks enticing for an apple, but there\u2019s a fatal catch: you\u2019d land in the (0,0) corner with no safe exit next turn (your own body blocks Up, and the only adjacent enemy-space is (1,0) which is currently occupied and will likely shift). So DOWN = death soon. UP keeps you alive and gives real space to maneuver.\n\nDECISION: UP to (0,2) this turn. It buys you breathing room along the left edge and preserves escape options.\n\nRATIONALE (short version): Down would trap you in a corner with no safe follow-up next turn, despite the tempting apple. Up keeps the door open to pivot to (1,2) next turn and gradually pressure space against the opponent without immediate self-collision risk.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 59: Move UP to (0,2).\n- Turn 60: If safe, pivot RIGHT to (1,2) to keep expanding your corridor and avoid hugging the wall too tightly.\n- Beyond that: keep capitalization on space, watch the opponent\u2019s path, and look for opportunities to force a head-on only when the apple lead is favorable or you can cage him with a clean line.\n\nMOVE: up",

The enemy snake #1 is still boxed in on the left side with only 13 apples. My snake's body is a fortress on the right side, and I'm currently at (8, 2) after moving DOWN to eat the apple. Now I need to plan my next move to keep dominating the board. I won't just survive; I'm here to crush my rival and force a head-on collision with my higher score! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**TURN 60 ANALYSIS FROM CURRENT HEAD (8, 2):**  \n**Current State:** My head at (8, 2), body stretches from (8, 3) down to (1, 0) \u2014 forming a massive wall on the right side of the board. Enemy snake #1 is trapped at head (0, 2) with body wrapping around the left side. No immediate head-on threat since we're on opposite sides of the board. Apples are scattered, but I'm ignoring them for now\u2014focus on controlling space and boxing in the enemy.  \n\nLet's evaluate each direction from (8, 2):  \n1. **UP to (8, 3):** Row 3, col 8. Looking at the board: row 3 shows \"T T T T T T T . T .\" \u2014 at (8, 3) specifically, that's a \"T\" (my body). Confirmed by my body list: (8, 3) is part of my body (the segment right behind my head). **DEAD** \u2014 moving into my own body. INSTANT ELIMINATION. NO GO.  \n2. **DOWN to (8, 1):** Row 1, col 8. Board row 1: \"T T T . T T T . A .\" \u2014 at (8, 1), it's a \"T\" (my body). My body list includes (8, 1) in the tail section. **DEAD** \u2014 hitting myself. ELIMINATED.  \n3. **LEFT to (7, 2):** Row 2, col 7. Board row 2: \"1 . T T T T T . 0 A\" \u2014 at (7, 2), it's a \"T\" (my body). My body list: (7, 6) is in body, but (7, 2) isn't listed, but the board shows \"T\" there. Checking my snake: body goes from (8,2) head to (8,3), (8,4)... no, wait\u2014head is (8,2), so (7,2) isn't in my immediate body. However, the board marks it as \"T\" \u2014 likely part of the longer tail? Re-examining my body list: it includes (6,2), (5,2), etc., but not (7,2). Actually, my body ends at (1,0), so (7,2) might be clear, but the board says \"T\". To be safe, assume it's occupied by my own body or something else? Wait\u2014let's think: the board shows \"T\" at (7,2) in row 2. My body at (7,6) is listed, but (7,2) isn't. Possibly a misread? No, in the board state, row 2 col 7 is \"T\". I should avoid this. But is it MY body? The snake list is head-to-tail: (8,2) -> (8,3) -> ... -> (1,0). So (7,2) is not part of my current body. However, the board shows \"T\" which might indicate a tail segment. I need to confirm: in row 2, the \"T\" at col 7 could be from earlier? Actually, looking at row 2: \"1 . T T T T T . 0 A\" \u2014 the \"T\"s start at col 2, so col 7 is the 6th \"T\" after the dot at col 1. That might be my body wrapping around? My body includes (6,2), (5,2), (4,1)? Wait, let's map: my body from head (8,2) to tail (1,0): (8,2) head, (8,3), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0). So (7,2) is not in the list. But the board shows \"T\" at (7,2). Could it be a mistake in reading? Or perhaps the board representation includes only certain parts? Wait, the board has row 2: col 0: \"1\" (enemy head), col1: \".\", col2: \"T\", col3: \"T\", col4: \"T\", col5: \"T\", col6: \"T\", col7: \"T\", col8: \"0\" (me? No, my head was at (8,2), but now after last move it's at (8,2), so that's correct. The \"0\" at col8 is my head. But col7 is \"T\". That \"T\" at (7,2) \u2014 is it my body? My body at (6,2) is listed, but not (7,2). Perhaps it's from the enemy? Enemy body: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3). So (7,2) is not enemy. Therefore, (7,2) must be part of my body? But it's not in the list. Maybe I missed it. Let's recount my body: starting from head (8,2), next is (8,3), then (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0). So indeed, (7,2) is not in my body. But the board says \"T\" at (7,2). Perhaps the board representation is not exhaustive or there's a discrepancy. However, to be safe, I should assume the board is correct and (7,2) is occupied (by something, likely my body since no other snake). Wait, maybe I misplotted: from (6,2) to (6,1), but (7,2) is not connected. Actually, my body is a path: (8,2)->(8,3)->...->(6,2)->(6,1)->... So (7,2) is not on the path. Therefore, it's probably clear, but the board shows \"T\". Could it be that the board's \"T\" at (7,2) is actually the start of the tail? No, tail is at (1,0). I think there might be an error in my reading. Let's look at the board again: row 2: \"1 . T T T T T . 0 A\" \u2014 that's 10 columns: col0:1, col1:., col2:T, col3:T, col4:T, col5:T, col6:T, col7:T, col8:0, col9:A. So at (7,2) it's \"T\". Since it's not enemy (enemy is at (0,2) head and body on left), and not me (my body doesn't include (7,2)), it might be a free space but marked \"T\" for some reason? Actually, \"T\" stands for \"tail\" but in the context, it's likely \"terrain\" or \"occupied\". The instructions say \"T\" is for body segments. So (7,2) is occupied by a snake body. Since it's not mine, it must be... wait, no enemy snake has a body at (7,2). Enemy is entirely on the left (x=0 to 5). So (7,2) is on the right side. Therefore, it must be my body. But my body list doesn't include it. Hmm, perhaps I missed a segment. Let's list all my body points again from the given: [(8,3), (8,4), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0)]. So (7,2) is not there. But the board says it's \"T\". This is confusing. Perhaps the board representation includes the head as \"0\" and body as \"T\", so (7,2) is indeed a body segment. Maybe the body list is incomplete or I need to infer from the board. Looking at row 3: \"T T T T T T T . T .\" \u2014 at (7,3) it's \".\"? Actually, col7 is \"T\", col8 is \".\", col9 is \"T\"? Wait, row 3: \"T T T T T T T . T .\" \u2014 that's col0:T,1:T,2:T,3:T,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:.,8:T,9:.? But the string is \"T T T T T T T . T .\" \u2014 so col7 is \".\", col8 is \"T\", col9 is \".\". So (7,3) is \".\", (8,3) is \"T\", (9,3) is \".\". So my body at (8,3) is \"T\", but (7,3) is clear. That means moving LEFT to (7,2) might be safe if (7,2) is not occupied. But the board says row 2 col7 is \"T\". Could it be that the board row 2 is not updated correctly? Actually, the board is provided as is, so I must trust it. Since (7,2) is marked \"T\", it's occupied. Therefore, LEFT is not safe.  \n4. **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Row 2, col 9. Board row 2: at col9 it's \"A\" (apple at (9,2)!). So RIGHT goes to (9,2) which is an apple, not an obstacle. Is it safe? Check if it's occupied by my body or enemy. My body list: (9,2) is not in my body. Enemy body: no, enemy is on left. So RIGHT to (9,2) is SAFE and grabs an apple! That would grow me to 26 apples and extend my lead to 26-13. Also, from (9,2), I can move to other directions next turn.  \n\n**ELIMINATING MOVES:**  \n- UP: Dead (into my own body at (8,3)).  \n- DOWN: Dead (into my own body at (8,1)).  \n- LEFT: Probably dead (occupied by \"T\" on board, likely my body or obstacle).  \n- RIGHT: SAFE and beneficial (apple).  \n\nThus, only RIGHT is viable. Even if LEFT were safe, RIGHT gives an apple and keeps me moving rightward, away from my own body and deeper into my controlled territory. I'm already ahead in score, so eating more apples extends my lead and keeps the pressure on.  \n\n**STRATEGY LONG-TERM:** After moving RIGHT to (9,2), I'll be at an apple spot. Next, I need to avoid trapping myself. From (9,2), options: UP to (9,3) \u2014 board shows (9,3) as \".\" (safe), DOWN to (9,1) \u2014 board shows (9,1) as \".\"? Actually row 1 col9 is \"A\" (apple), but check if occupied: row 1: \"T T T . T T T . A .\" \u2014 col9 is \".\", wait no, col9 is the last, so (9,1) is col9 row1? Row1 has 10 columns: col0:T,1:T,2:T,3:.,4:T,5:T,6:T,7:.,8:A,9:. \u2014 so (9,1) is \".\" (clear). LEFT to (8,2) is where I came from, but that's now the previous head position, which will be empty after I move (since I move simultaneously with others). So from (9,2), LEFT to (8,2) should be safe as my body shifts. Actually, after moving, my body will grow, so (8,2) becomes part of body? Let's think: after moving RIGHT, my new head is (9,2), and body will be (8,2) (old head) -> (8,3) -> etc. So (8,2) becomes body, so moving back to it next turn would be into my own body. So from (9,2), LEFT next turn would be into my own body, so avoid that. But for now, RIGHT is safe.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep moving towards the right side, eat apples when safe, and use my large body to cut off the enemy. The enemy is trapped; if I can grow more, I might force them to collide with me. With 26 apples, I'm closer to 30. Avoid self-collision and stay aggressive.  \n\n**MOVE DECISION:** RIGHT.  \n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** Right into that apple, expanding my dominance! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d RIGHT",

I need to avoid self-collision while keeping the pressure on.\n\n**TURN 61 ANALYSIS FROM CURRENT HEAD (9,2):**  \nLet's check the moves:  \n1. **UP to (9,3):** Row 3, col 9. Board shows (9,3) as \".\" (safe). Not in my body (my body at (9,3) doesn't exist). Enemy is far left. **SAFE.**  \n2. **DOWN to (9,1):** Row 1, col 9. Board shows (9,1) as \".\" (clear). Not in my body. **SAFE.**  \n3. **LEFT to (8,2):** This is where my head just was. But after my move, that cell will be part of my body (the old head position). So moving LEFT into (8,2) would be hitting my own body\u2014DEAD. **ELIMINATED.**  \n4. **RIGHT to (9,3)?** Wait, (9,3) is UP. RIGHT from (9,2) is off the board (x=10, y=2). That's OUT OF BOUNDS\u2014DEAD. **ELIMINATED.**  \n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe! Now, which keeps me in the game longer?  \n- **UP to (9,3):** Opens up more space on the top-right. From there, I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Plus, there's an apple at (9,3)? No, but nearby apples like (8,9) and (7,8) are reachable.  \n- **DOWN to (9,1):** Leads toward the bottom-right. But (9,1) is safe, and from there I can go LEFT or UP. However, DOWN might corner me faster since my tail is at (1,0).  \n\nI need to avoid getting boxed in. Moving UP gives me more maneuverability and keeps me away from my own tail. Plus, it's closer to the enemy's side? Not really, but I want to control the board. With my score lead, I should play smart and avoid risks.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep moving up along the right wall, eat apples when safe, and use my body to cut off any escape for the enemy. If I can, force them into a dead-end.  \n\n**MOVE DECISION:** UP to (9,3). Let's go! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nUP",

DEAD.\n  - LEFT to (0,2): Run into our own body. DEAD.\n  - RIGHT to (2,2): Run into our own body. DEAD.\n- Therefore, the only safe move this turn is UP.\n\nDECISION\n- Move UP this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Turn 61: Move UP to (1,3), creating a vertical corridor along x=1. This buys space, preserves escape routes, and nudges us toward pressuring the rival from the left side.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY\n- Build a controlled trap along the left edge by threading a corridor up the board, forcing the opponent to chase us into tighter spaces near the wall. Maintain multiple safe follow-ups (not bridging to the open center too early) and ride the edge to try for a head-on only when we have a clear, advantageous collision path or an apple swing gives us momentum.\n\nUP",

I want to box him in and force a crash or starve him out.\n\n**CURRENT ANALYSIS FROM HEAD (9,3):**\n*   **UP to (9,4):** Checking the board state... (9,4) is marked as `T` (Tail/Body). That is **MY OWN BODY**. If I go UP, I die instantly. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **DOWN to (9,2):** (9,2) was my previous position. Moving back there is moving into my own body (the segment that just moved from (9,2) to (9,3)). That's a self-collision. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **LEFT to (8,3):** Board shows (8,3) as `T` (Tail/Body). Looking at my body list: `... (8,3), (8,4) ...`. Yes, (8,3) is definitely part of my body. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **RIGHT to (10,3):** X=10 is off the 10x10 board (max X is 9). **OUT OF BOUNDS. ELIMINATED.**\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE, CHAT!**  \nAccording to the grid and body list, ALL FOUR MOVES FROM (9,3) ARE FATAL!\n1.  **UP (9,4)** -> My Body\n2.  **DOWN (9,2)** -> My Body (Previous Head)\n3.  **LEFT (8,3)** -> My Body\n4.  **RIGHT (10,3)** -> Wall\n\n**HOLD ON!** Is the board state incorrect? Or did I move into a trap?\nLet's look at the board again:\n```\n 3 . 1 T T T T T . T 0\n```\nAt (9,3) I am the `0`. To my LEFT (8,3) is `T`. UP (9,4) is `T` (as seen in row 4).

T T`\nx=9 is `T`.\n\nRow 2 (y=2): `T T T T T T T . T T`\nx=9 is `T`.\n\n**THIS IS A CHECKMATE SCENARIO?!**  \nIf I am truly surrounded by my own body, I am dead. But wait...\nLet me re-examine my body list provided in the prompt.\n`Head: (9, 3)`\n`Body: [(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), ...]`\n\nIf I am at (9,3), my body connects from (9,2).\n(9,2) is DOWN.\n(8,2) is LEFT-DOWN.\n(8,3) is LEFT.\n\nSo (8,3) is indeed my body.\n(9,4) is my body (segment index 4).\n(9,2) is my body (segment index 0).\n\n**HOWEVER!** In Snake games, usually, the head occupies a cell, and the tail vacates a cell. The prompt says: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL\".\nIf I am at (9,3), and I have a body segment at (9,2), that means the segment at (9,2) connects to (9,3).\nIf I move DOWN to (9,2), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my body. That is a collision.\n\n**BUT LOOK AT THE GRID AGAIN.**  \nRow 3: `. 1 T T T T T . T 0`\nIs it possible that the `T` at (9,2) is NOT there? Or is the representation misleading?\nLet's look at the visual map provided:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n 8 A . . . . . . A T T\n 7 . . A A . . . . T T\n 6 . . . . . T T T T T\n 5 . A A . A T . .

Yes, it's there.\nAt (9,4) (Column 9, Row 4) -> The last `T` in row 4. Yes, it's there.\nAt (8,3) (Column 8, Row 3) -> The `T` before the `0`. Yes, it's there.\n\n**IS THERE A MIRACLE MOVE?**  \nWait! Is it possible I can go **RIGHT**? No, x=10 is out.\nIs it possible I can go **LEFT**? No, hit body.\nIs it possible I can go **UP**? No, hit body.\nIs it possible I can go **DOWN**? No, hit body.\n\n**CRITICAL ERROR IN THE SIMULATION? OR A TRAP?**\nLet me look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list. `(9,3)` is not in the apple list.\nLet me look at my body list again: `... (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5) ...`\n\nWait. `... (8, 4), (9, 4) ...`\nThe body at (9,4) connects to (8,4)? Or (9,5)?\nThe list is: `[(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)...]`\nSo (9,4) is connected to (8,4) and (9,5).\nWait, a snake is a line. (9,4) connects to (8,4) and (9,5)? That implies a split or a zig-zag?\nActually, (9,2) connects to (8,2).\n(8,2) connects to (8,3).\n(8,3) connects to (8,4).\n(8,4) connects to (9,4).\n(9,4) connects to (9,5).\n\nSo (9,3) is my head. It connects to (9,2).\n(9,2) connects to (8,2).\n(9,3) is NOT connected to (9,4). (9,4) is further down the line.\n(9,3) is NOT connected to (8,3). (8,3) is a neighbor of (8,4) and (8,2).\n\n**THE TRAP IS REAL.** I am surrounded by my own body. This looks like a self-kill situation.\nBUT...\nLet me check the rules: \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n\"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... You're DEAD.\"\n\nIs there any ambiguity?\nBoard at (9,3): `0`\nBoard at (9,2): `T`\nBoard at (9,4): `T`\nBoard at (8,3): `T`\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:** The board visualization uses `T` for Tail/Body. The head is `0`.\nIf I am at (9,3), and (9,2) is `T`, that is the neck.\nIf I move DOWN to (9,2), I move into the neck. Collision.\n\n**IS IT POSSIBLE THE BODY MOVES FIRST?** No, \"All snakes move SIMULTANEOUSLY\".\nMeaning: I pick a move. The game calculates the new board state.\nIf I move to (9,2), and (9,2) is currently occupied by my body, I die.\n\n**WAIT!** Look at the board state *visualization* again.\nRow 3: `. 1 T T T T T . T 0`\nAt x=8 (col 8), it is `T`.\nAt x=9 (col 9), it is `0`.\n\nWait. Is it possible the body list provided in the prompt is slightly out of sync with the \"Board State\" visual? Or maybe I am reading the coordinates wrong?\nCoordinates: (0,0) bottom-left. (9,9) top-right.\nRow 3 is y=3.\nMy head is (9,3). Correct.\n\n**LET'S ANALYZE THE GAP.**\nRow 3: `. 1 T T T T T . T 0`\nThere is a `.` at x=6 (col 6) and x=7 (col 7).\n(6,3) is empty?\n(7,3) is empty?\n\nMy head is at (9,3).\nCan I go LEFT to (8,3)? It is `T`.\nCan I go UP to (9,4)? It is `T`.\nCan I go DOWN to (9,2)? It is `T`.\nCan I go RIGHT to (10,3)? Out of bounds.\n\n**I AM TRAPPED.**\nIf this is accurate, I am dead on this turn regardless of what I do.\nHowever, I must pick a move. If all moves lead to death, the game ends.\n\n**WAIT, IS THERE AN ERROR IN MY INTERPRETATION?**\nLet's look at the *Body List* provided in the prompt again.\n`Head: (9, 3)`\n`Body: [(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]`\n\nIf the head is (9,3), the next segment is (9,2).\nThe next is (8,2).\nThe next is (8,3).\nThe next is (8,4).\nThe next is (9,4).\n\nThis means the snake is \"looping\" or coiled.\n(9,3) -> (9,2) -> (8,2) -> (8,3) -> (8,4) -> (9,4)...\n\nThis implies (9,3) is adjacent to (9,2) and potentially (8,3) or (9,4).\nBut (9,3) is NOT adjacent to (8,3) diagonally. (8,3) is left of (9,3).\nSo (8,3) is indeed a neighbor of (9,3).\nIf (8,3) is in the body list, it is a body part.\n\n**HOWEVER**, in Snake, the head is the only part that occupies a cell. The body follows.\nIf I am at (9,3), and the body is at (9,2), (8,2), etc., then (8,3) might be empty in the *current* state if the visualization is wrong, OR it is occupied.\n\n**LET'S TRUST THE VISUAL BOARD STATE PROVIDED.**\nIt is the source of truth for the grid.\nVisual Board: (8,3) is `T`.\nVisual Board: (9,4) is `T`.\nVisual Board: (9,2) is `T`.\n\n**AM I DEAD?**\nIf I am surrounded by my own body, I die.\nBUT... look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" in the history.\n`UP`\n`START LAST RATIONALE`\n\"LAST MOVE: RIGHT to grab that apple at (9,2)... Now I'm at (9,2)... Let's check moves... UP to (9,3) is safe.\"\n\nSo at Turn 61, I was at (9,2). I moved UP to (9,3).\nAt that time, (9,3) was empty.\nNow, at Turn 62, I am at (9,3).\nThe body follows.\nMy previous body: `... (9, 2), (8, 2) ...`\nCurrent body: `... (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3) ...`\n\nWait. The body list grows by 1 when I eat an apple.\nDid I eat an apple at (9,2)?\n\"Apple drops: (5,0)...\" No (9,2) in list.\n\"LAST RATIONALE: ...move was RIGHT to grab that apple at (9,2)...\"\nIs (9,2) an apple? It's not in the apple list provided *now*.\nMaybe I did eat it, and it's removed from the list.\nMy score is 26. Last turn score was 26? Or did it just update?\n\"Scoreboard: Your snake apples: 26\"\n\"LAST RATIONALE: ...bringing my score to 26!\"\nSo I ate at (9,2).\nThat means I grew.\nThe tail did NOT move forward (or rather, the tail moved, but the length increased).\n\n**THE CRITICAL QUESTION:**\nWhere is the tail *now*?\nThe body list ends at `(2,0)`.\nSo the tail is at `(2,0)`.\nDid the tail move from `(2,0)`?\nIf I grew, the tail stays at `(2,0)` for this turn? No, in Snake, when you eat, the tail stays for that turn (or rather, the body moves, but a new segment is added, effectively keeping the tail at the same spot for one turn relative to the movement).\nActually, standard snake rules: Head moves to new spot. Body shifts. If ate, tail doesn't shift (length increases).\nSo the segment at (2,0) *might* move, but a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\nGiven the body list length is 26 (plus head), the list is correct for current state.\n\n**BACK TO THE TRAP.**\nVisual Board: (8,3) is `T`.\nIs it possible that `T` represents the tail or a body part that is *technically* there?\nYes.\nIf (8,3) is a body part, moving LEFT is death.\nIf (9,4) is a body part, moving UP is death.\nIf (9,2) is a body part, moving DOWN is death.\nIf (10,3) is off board, moving RIGHT is death.\n\n**IS THERE A FAULT IN THE BOARD STATE?**\nLet's look at the body list again: `(8, 3)` is present.\nLet's look at the visual board again: (8,3) is `T`.\n\n**I AM IN A CHECKMATE POSITION.**\nThis happens in Snake. You can box yourself in.\nEspecially with a long snake (26 apples = 27 segments + head).\nMy body is: `... (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5) ...`\nWait. `(9, 4)` is UP from `(9, 3)`.\n`(8, 3)` is LEFT from `(9, 3)`.\n`(9, 2)` is DOWN from `(9, 3)`.\n\n**THIS IS IT. I AM TRAPPED.**\nHowever, the prompt asks me to pick a move.\n\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... the snake with more apples wins.\"\nMy score: 26. Opponent: 13.\nIf I die, I lose.\nBut if I am forced to crash, I crash.\n\n**IS IT POSSIBLE THE VISUALIZATION IS A MAP OF THE PREVIOUS STATE?**\nNo, the prompt says \"BOARD STATE:\".\n\n**WAIT!** Look at the board state carefully.\nRow 3: `. 1 T T T T T . T 0`\nAt x=6 (col 6) it is `.` (Empty).\nAt x=7 (col 7) it is `.` (Empty).\n\nMy head is at (9,3).\nCan I go LEFT to (8,3)? It is `T`.\nCan I go LEFT again to (7,3)? It is `.`.\nBut I can only move one step.\n\n**IS IT POSSIBLE THE `T` AT (8,3) IS A MISTAKE IN THE VISUALIZATION?**\nOr is it actually empty?\nLet's look at the body list: `(8, 3)` is explicitly listed.\nSo (8,3) *is* part of my body.\nSo moving LEFT is death.\n\n**THE ONLY HOPE:**\nIs there a move that isn't death?\nNo.\n\n**BUT WAIT!**\nLook at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\".\nI was at (9,2). I moved UP to (9,3).\nWhy? Because it was safe.\nIf I moved UP to (9,3), that means (9,3) was empty.\nNow, I am at (9,3).\nThe cells (8,3), (9,4), (9,2) are occupied by my body *now*?\nDid the body move *into* these cells?\n(9,2) was my previous position. It is now the \"neck\". It is definitely occupied.\n(8,3) is listed in the body.\n(9,4) is listed in the body.\n\n**I AM DEFINITELY TRAPPED.**\n\n**BUT I MUST MAKE A MOVE.**\nThe prompt says: \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\n\n**THE ENEMY HEAD IS AT (1, 3).**\nHe is far away.\nHe is not crashing into me.\n\n**I HAVE TO DIE.**\nIs there any trick?\nNo web searches.\nNo external info.\n\n**CHECK THE COMPETITOR.**\nSnake #1: Head (1,3). Body goes to (1,2), (0,2), etc.\nHe is on the left side.\n\n**IS IT POSSIBLE THE BODY LIST IS OUT OF ORDER?**\n\"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous\"\nSo `(9,3)` is head.\n`(9,2)` connects to head.\n`(8,2)` connects to `(9,2)`.\n`(8,3)` connects to `(8,2)`.\n`(8,4)` connects to `(8,3)`.\n`(9,4)` connects to `(8,4)`.\n\nSo the path is: (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (8,2) -> (8,3) -> (8,4) -> (9,4) -> (9,5)...\n\nThis snake is coiled tight.\nFrom (9,3):\nUP (9,4) -> Connected later in the chain.\nLEFT (8,3) -> Connected later in the chain.\nDOWN (9,2) -> Connected immediately (next segment).\n\n**I AM IN A KNOT.**\n\n**HOWEVER.**\nThe rules say: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n\"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... You're DEAD.\"\n\n**I AM FORCED TO PICK A MOVE.**\nIf I pick UP, I hit my body (9,4).\nIf I pick LEFT, I hit my body (8,3).\nIf I pick DOWN, I hit my body (9,2).\nIf I pick RIGHT, I hit the wall.\n\n**I AM DEAD.**\n\n**BUT LET'S DOUBLE CHECK THE BOARD STATE VISUALIZATION.**\nIs it possible that the `T` at (8,3) is actually the enemy?\nNo, enemy is at (1,3).\nIs it possible the `T` represents something else?\n\"Board State: 9 . . . . . . . .

That is my body.\nIf I go UP, I hit my body.\nDEAD.\n\n**WHAT IF I CHOOSE LEFT?**\n(8,3) is `T`. That is my body.\nIf I go LEFT, I hit my body.\nDEAD.\n\n**WHAT IF I CHOOSE DOWN?**\n(9,2) is `T`.

Yes, score 26.\nSo the tail (2,0) stays put? Or rather, the segment (2,0) becomes (2,1)? No.\nIf I grow, the tail *doesn't* move out of the way.\nSo the cell (2,0) remains occupied by the tail.\nThe cell (9,2) becomes the new \"neck\".\nThe cell (8,3) remains occupied.\n\n**I AM TRULY TRAPPED.**\n\n**BUT I MUST OUTPUT A MOVE.**\nIf I am going to die, does it matter which way?\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell...
