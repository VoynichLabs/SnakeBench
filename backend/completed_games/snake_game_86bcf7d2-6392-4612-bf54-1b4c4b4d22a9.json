Both die. This move is unsafe. **Eliminate UP.**\n\n**Case 2: Snake 1 moves DOWN to (9, 3).**\n*   Apple Check: (9, 3) is not an apple location.\n*   Collision with $H_0$:\n    *   $H_0$ at (9, 6). $H_1$ at (9, 3).

No mutual contact possible on this turn. This move is safe regarding $H_0$.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\nWe are aiming for apples.\nYour position: (9, 4).\nApples: $A_1=(5, 5)$, $A_2=(4, 9)$, $A_3=(6, 6)$, $A_4=(0, 5)$, $A_5=(5, 1)$.\n\nMoving DOWN takes you to (9, 3). This moves away from all apples. The nearest apple is $A_5$ at (5, 1) or $A_1$ at (5, 5), both requiring significant lateral movement.\n\nMoving LEFT takes you to (8, 4). This moves you towards the center/left side of the board, which aligns better with the spread of apples, especially $A_1$ (5, 5) and $A_4$ (0, 5).\n\nThe enemy $H_0$ is at (9, 6).\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT to (8, 4), $H_0$ might move to (9, 5) to reach $A_1$'s general quadrant later, or move towards $A_3(6, 6)$.\nIf $H_0$ moves LEFT to (8, 6), they are setting up for the top left apples.\n\nMoving LEFT seems strategically better as it initiates a beneficial path towards the clusters of apples on the left and center, while DOWN is purely defensive/neutral relative to the apple locations.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is preferred over DOWN.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move LEFT towards the center of the board and the cluster of apples starting around (5, 5). Avoid the imminent collision risk identified with UP.\n\nLEFT",

It has no body segments.\nEnemy snake (ID 0) was at (9, 6). We assume the enemy chose a safe move and did not collide with us. The previous analysis showed that UP caused a potential head-on collision if the enemy moved DOWN to (9, 5). We chose LEFT to (8, 4).\n\nEnemy Head $H_0$ was at (9, 6). Possible safe moves for $H_0$: UP (9, 7), DOWN (9, 5), LEFT (8, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Enemy's Likely Move:**\nThe enemy at (9, 6) is relatively far from apples, except $A_3=(6, 6)$ which requires moving substantially left.\n\n1. If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (9, 5): They are near $A_1=(5, 5)$. This is a reasonable approach move.\n2. If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (8, 6): They are moving towards the center horizontally.\n3. If $H_0$ moves UP to (9, 7): They are moving away from most apples.\n\nSince this is turn 2, maximizing apple proximity is key. Moving LEFT to (8, 6) or DOWN to (9, 5) seem likely for the opponent.\n\n**Snake 1 Position:** $H_1 = (8, 4)$. No body.\n**Apples:** $A_1=(5, 5)$, $A_2=(4, 9)$, $A_3=(6, 6)$, $A_4=(0, 5)$, $A_5=(5, 1)$.\n\n**Possible Moves for Snake 1 (Current position (8, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP:** $(8, 5)$. Distance to $A_1(5, 5)$ is 3 steps (LEFT). Distance to $A_3(6, 6)$ is $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} \\approx 2.8$ (Diagonal).\n    *   Collision check against $H_0$:\n        *   If $H_0$ moved DOWN to (9, 5): Safe.\n        *   If $H_0$ moved LEFT to (8, 6): $H_0$ is adjacent, no collision.\n        *   If $H_0$ moved UP to (9, 7): Safe.\n    *   This move heads in the general direction of $A_1$ and $A_3$.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** $(8, 3)$. Moves away from all apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** $(7, 4)$. Moves towards the left side where $A_4=(0, 5)$ is, but further from $A_1, A_3$.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** $(9, 4)$. This is where the snake just came from. Reversing is only dangerous if the snake had length 1 or more (which it doesn't now), but strategically it moves away from the center mass of apples.\n\n**Analysis of UP (8, 5):**\n(8, 5) is ideally positioned between $A_1(5, 5)$ and $A_3(6, 6)$. If we can reach $A_1$ on the next move (by moving LEFT to (7, 5) or (5, 5)), that would be great.\n\nIf $H_1$ moves UP to (8, 5):\n*   If $H_0$ moved to (9, 5) or (8, 6), we are safe for this turn.\n*   If $H_0$ moved to (9, 7), we are safe.\n\nLet's assume the opponent makes a reasonable move, like LEFT to (8, 6) or DOWN to (9, 5). Both leave us safe if we move UP.\n\nMoving UP puts us on Y=5, a highly populated Y-coordinate line for apples ($A_1(5, 5), A_4(0, 5)$). This seems like the strongest directional move towards the nearest apples ($A_1$).\n\n**Comparing UP (8, 5) vs LEFT (7, 4):**\n*   UP targets $A_1(5, 5)$ and $A_3(6, 6)$.\n*   LEFT targets $A_4(0, 5)$.\n\n$A_1$ is Manhattan distance 3 away: $|8-5| + |5-5| = 3$.\n$A_4$ is Manhattan distance 8 away: $|8-0| + |5-5| = 8$.\n\nUP is clearly better positioned for immediate apple acquisition, especially $A_1$.\n\n**Safety Check for UP (8, 5) considering *all* potential enemy moves:**\n*   $H_0$ at (9, 6).\n*   Enemy potential next positions: (9, 7), (9, 5), (8, 6).\n*   If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (9, 5), it is adjacent to $H_1$ at (8, 5). No collision this turn.\n*   If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (8, 6), it is adjacent to $H_1$ at (8, 5). No collision this turn.\n*   If $H_0$ moves UP to (9, 7), it is far.\n\nSince we have no body, moving UP to (8, 5) is safe from self-collision and sets up the best approach vector for $A_1(5, 5)$.\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards the nearest apples, prioritizing $A_1(5, 5)$ or $A_3(6, 6)$. Maintain maximum separation from $H_0$ if possible while achieving apple goals. Next turn, if $H_0$ moved to (8, 6), we should be cautious about moving to (7, 5) or (7, 4) as they might be setting up parallel movements.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nFocus on Apple $A_1$ at (5, 5). Current position (8, 4). Move UP to (8, 5). Next turn, try LEFT (7, 5) to get closer to X=5. Monitor enemy $H_0$. If $H_0$ moves towards the $Y=5$ line, be prepared to change direction or prioritize safety.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**",

Safe from $H_1$. Moves away from apples.\n2.  **DOWN:** (8, 5). **Collision!** $H_1$ is at (8, 5). This move kills $H_0$. Since we are alive, this means $H_0$ cannot move DOWN.\n3.  **LEFT:** (7, 6). Safe from $H_1$. Moves towards $A_3(6, 6)$.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (9, 6). Safe from $H_1$. Moves away from apples.\n\nIf $H_0$ chooses DOWN, $H_0$ dies. If $H_0$ is rational, it won't choose DOWN. The likely beneficial moves for $H_0$ aiming for apples are LEFT (7, 6) towards $A_3$, or RIGHT (9, 6) to stay central. UP (8, 7) is passive.\n\nLet's analyze our options (from (8, 5)) based on these likely $H_0$ moves:\n\n**1. Move LEFT to (7, 5):**\n*   **Targets $A_1(5, 5)$.** Distance is now 2 (LEFT, LEFT). Excellent approach.\n*   **Collision Check:**\n    *   If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (7, 6): $H_0$ is adjacent, safe.\n    *   If $H_0$ moves RIGHT to (9, 6): Safe.\n    *   If $H_0$ moves UP to (8, 7): Safe.\n    *   If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (8, 5) (suicide): $H_1$ is not moving there, so safe for $H_1$.\n*   This move strongly positions us to eat $A_1$ next turn (if $H_0$ doesn't block or attack us).\n\n**2. Move DOWN to (8, 4):** (Reverse of prior move)\n*   **Targets $A_5(5, 1)$.** Further away from $A_1, A_3$.\n*   **Collision Check:** Since $H_0$ can move to (8, 6), it will not collide with (8, 4). Safe movement.\n\n**3. Move RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n*   **Targets nothing immediately nearby.**\n*   **Collision Check:** Safe against all predictable $H_0$ moves.\n\n**4. Move UP to (8, 6):**\n*   **Collision Check:** If $H_0$ stays at (8, 6) (Suicide if $H_0$ attempts to move BACKWARDS to (8, 7) or (9, 5) then somehow moves to (8, 6) - Wait, $H_0$ moves *simultaneously*. If $H_0$ is at (8, 6) and we move UP to (8, 6), this is a head-on collision. **DEAD.**\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT (7, 5) is the strongest move. It sets up an approach to $A_1(5, 5)$ in 2 steps and appears safe against all rational countermoves by $H_0$. If $H_0$ surprisingly moves DOWN to (8, 5), $H_0$ dies and we continue safely at (7, 5).\n\n**Long Term Plan Update:** Continue path towards $A_1(5, 5)$. If $H_0$ blocks future $(7, 5) \\to (6, 5)$ movement, re-evaluate towards $A_3(6, 6)$. Need to be wary of $H_0$ moving to (7, 6) as that places them adjacent to our target path (7, 5) $\\to$ (6, 5).\n\nIf $H_0$ moves to (7, 6), $H_1$ moves to (7, 5). Now $H_1=(7, 5), H_0=(7, 6)$. They are parallel and adjacent. $H_1$ can move LEFT to (6, 5) and eat $A_1$. $H_0$ must choose a move. If $H_0$ moves UP to (7, 7) or DOWN to (7, 5) (killing $H_0$), or RIGHT to (8, 6) (safe). If $H_0$ moves RIGHT to (8, 6), $H_1$ eats the apple. This path seems very promising.\nLEFT\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**",

(Note: The current turn 4 board lists $A$ at $(7, 4)$ and $H_0$ at $(6, 6)$ with body at $(7, 6)$, meaning $H_0$ ate $(7, 4)$ last turn and moved to $(6, 6)$ this turn, or the board states provided are inconsistent across turns, which happens frequently in these simulations.)\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I MUST use the board state and data provided for Turn 4, despite the last move rationale referencing *different* starting positions/apples for Turn 3.\n\n**Current State (Turn 4):**\nBoard Size 10x10.

(This implies I was aiming for $A_5(7, 4)$ which is now an apple slot, T=4 board state shows $A$ at (7, 4)).\n\n*If $H_1$ ate $(7, 4)$ last turn:* My score should be 1, not 0.\n*If my last move (LEFT) resulted in $H_1$ being at $(6, 4)$:* I did not eat an apple last turn, as $(6, 4)$ does not have an apple currently.\n\nLet's stick strictly to the provided current state for safe movement generation, ignoring the consistency error caused by the previous turn's rationale/move.\n\n**$H_1 = (6, 4)$ (Safe moves check - Snake $S_1$ is not growing, body list is empty)**\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Safe from $H_0(6, 6)$ (adjacent, not head-on). Safe from $B_0(7, 6)$. Not hitting $H_1$'s (empty) body. Target $A_1(5, 5)$ (distance 1 diagonally).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Board boundary safe. Safe from $H_0/B_0$.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Board boundary safe. Target $A_1(5, 5)$ (distance 1 diagonally).\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** **Potential Apple!** $A_5$ is at $(7, 4)$. Moving here grants a point and growth.\n\n**$H_0 = (6, 6)$, $B_0 = [(7, 6)]$ (Predicting $H_0$'s move from (6, 6))**\nPossible moves for $H_0$:\n*   UP (6, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (6, 5): This cell is adjacent to $H_1=(6, 4)$.\n*   LEFT (5, 6): Safe. Moves towards $A_1$.\n*   RIGHT (7, 6): **Collision!** $H_0$ hits its own body $B_0$ if it moves RIGHT. $H_0$ cannot move RIGHT.\n\nIf $H_0$ moves DOWN to (6, 5): $H_1$ moving RIGHT to (7, 4) is safe because $H_0$ is not moving to (7, 4) and $H_0$ is not moving to (6, 4). Collision check (Head-Head): $H_1(7, 4)$ vs $H_0(6, 5)$. No collision.\nIf $H_0$ moves DOWN to (6, 5): $H_1$ moving UP to (6, 5) would be a head-on collision (both die).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for $H_1(6, 4)$:**\n\n**1. RIGHT to (7, 4) [EAT APPLE]:**\n    *   If $H_0$ moves (6, 5) [DOWN]: Safe. $H_1$ eats apple. $H_1=(7, 4), H_0=(6, 5)$.\n    *   If $H_0$ moves (6, 7) [UP]: Safe. $H_1$ eats apple. $H_1=(7, 4), H_0=(6, 7)$.\n    *   If $H_0$ moves (5, 6) [LEFT]: Safe. $H_1$ eats apple. $H_1=(7, 4), H_0=(5, 6)$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT eats the nearest apple and results in a safe position against all predicted $H_0$ moves. Since $H_0$ cannot move into $H_1$'s new position $(7, 4)$ AND $H_0$ cannot move to $(6, 5)$ if $H_1$ moves there (which it couldn't anyway due to eating the apple), this is the best move.\n\n**2. UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (6, 5) [Head-Head Collision! $H_0$ moves to $H_1$'s destination]. **DEAD.** (Unless $H_0$ is irrational and chooses to die by moving DOWN to (6, 5) when it could move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (if not into body)). Actually, $H_0$ cannot move RIGHT (into body). So $H_0$ has UP, DOWN, LEFT options. If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (6, 5), we die. If $H_0$ moves UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6), we live, but $H_0$ advances towards $A_1(5, 5)$ or stays central. This move is risky due to potential $H_0$ move choice.\n\n**3. LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   $H_0$ can move DOWN to (6, 5) or UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6). All safe for $H_1$. This moves us one step closer to $A_1(5, 5)$ diagonally, compared to other safe initial moves. If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (5, 6), we are adjacent.\n\n**4. DOWN to (6, 3):**\n    *   Passive move, moves further away from all existing apples.\n\n**Final Choice:** RIGHT (7, 4) is superior as it secures an apple immediately and is safe regardless of $H_0$'s three rational choices (UP, DOWN, LEFT). If $H_0$ chooses DOWN to (6, 5), we successfully eat the apple at (7, 4) and score, ending up at $H_1=(7, 4)$ while $H_0=(6, 5)$. This gives us the lead in score (1-1).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Secure apples while maintaining safety from $H_0$. $H_1$ is now at $(7, 4)$ (assumed success). $H_0$ is likely at $(6, 5), (6, 7)$, or $(5, 6)$. Next target is $A_1(5, 5)$. If $H_0$ is at $(6, 5)$ or $(5, 6)$, we can approach $(5, 5)$ safely from $(6, 5)$ or $(7, 5)$.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

If $H_0$ moves DOWN to $(6, 4)$ and $H_1$ moves UP to $(7, 5)$, $H_0$ dies by running into $B_1$.\n\n**What if $H_0$ moved Left (5, 6) in T4?** (Instead of Down to (6, 5))\n$H_1=(7, 4), B_1=[(6, 4)]$. $H_0=(5, 6), B_0=[(7, 6)]$. (Assuming $H_0$ didn't eat, body list grows). $B_0 = [(6, 6), (7, 6)]$.\nNext target $A_1(5, 5)$.\n$H_1(7, 4)$ tries UP to $(7, 5)$:\n$H_0(5, 6)$ move options: UP(5, 7), DOWN(5, 5) [EAT], LEFT(4, 6), RIGHT(6, 6).\nIf $H_0$ moves DOWN to $(5, 5)$ [EATS Apple]. Score 2-2. $H_1$ at $(7, 5)$. Safe.\nIf $H_0$ moves RIGHT to $(6, 6)$. Safe. Score 2-1.\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to $(5, 7)$. Safe. Score 2-1.\nIf $H_0$ moves LEFT to $(4, 6)$. Safe. Score 2-1.\nNo guaranteed instant win if $H_0$ moved LEFT in T4.\n\n**Conclusion Reverting to Most Likely $H_0$ Move (DOWN to 6, 5):**\nThe analysis in T4 predicted $H_0$ moved DOWN to (6, 5) because it targeted $A_1(5, 5)$ area relatively well compared to UP or LEFT (which leaves $H_0$ too close to the wall or too far).\nIf $H_0$ is at $(6, 5)$: Moving UP to $(7, 5)$ causes the potential instantaneous win if $H_0$ chooses the self-destruct move DOWN to $(6, 4)$ (which is $B_1$). Since agents are generally rational, $H_0$ should avoid self-destruction. $H_0$ will likely choose UP (6, 6), LEFT (5, 5) [EAT], or RIGHT (7, 5) [Collision with $H_1$ if $H_1$ moves UP].\n\nSince $H_1$ moving UP to (7, 5) results in a guaranteed self-destruct move for $H_0$ if $H_0$ chooses DOWN to (6, 4), this is highly favorable. If $H_0$ avoids this path, $H_1$ is safely positioned closer to $A_1(5, 5)$ than if it moved passively.\n\nIf $H_0$ chooses RIGHT to (7, 5) $\\rightarrow$ Simultaneous death (Score tied 2-1, Draw). We must avoid this.\nIf $H_0$ chooses LEFT to (5, 5) [EATS] $\\rightarrow H_1$ survives at (7, 5). Score 2-2. $H_0$ grows.\nIf $H_0$ chooses UP to (6, 6) $\\rightarrow H_1$ survives at (7, 5). Score 2-1. $H_0$ moves away from $A_1$.\n\nThe move UP (7, 5) is favorable because it pressures $H_0$ into either letting us live while they eat an apple, or moving into a position where they die if they try to kill us by targeting our body. If $H_0$ moves to (7, 5) as well, we both die, which is the worst outcome (Draw). We must check if $H_0$ *must* move to (7, 5). No, $H_0$ has 3 other safe moves if it is at (6, 5) and needs to avoid $B_1(6, 4)$ and our new head $(7, 5)$.\n\nIf $H_0$ is at $(6, 5)$:\nMove Right to $(7, 5)$: Collision $\\rightarrow$ Draw.\nMove Left to $(5, 5)$: Eats Apple. $H_1$ at $(7, 5)$. Safe. (Score 2-2).\nMove Up to $(6, 6)$: Safe. $H_1$ at $(7, 5)$. Safe. (Score 2-1).\nMove Down to $(6, 4)$: Hits $B_1$. $H_0$ dies. $H_1$ wins! (Score 2-1).\n\nSince rational agents avoid death, $H_0$ will not move DOWN to (6, 4). $H_0$ will choose between UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. RIGHT causes a draw. LEFT allows $H_0$ to gain an apple/score lead. UP is passive but safe. If $H_0$ is prioritizing score, it moves LEFT. If $H_0$ is prioritizing safety, it moves UP.\n\nGiven that $H_0$ is ahead in score (1 vs 2 currently, wait, I ate two total, they have 1), $H_0$ definitely wants to eat (5, 5). If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (5, 5), we both live. This leads to a better position for $S_1$ than being passive.\n\nMove UP is the best available aggressive/safe move positioning us adjacent to $A_1$ if $H_0$ moves LEFT, or maintaining pressure if $H_0$ moves UP.\n\nLonger term plan: If $H_0$ eats $(5, 5)$, score becomes 2-2, and $H_0$ now has $H_0(5, 5)$ with a larger body targeting $A_3(0, 5)$. We should pivot towards $A_3$ or $A_4(5, 1)$ in the next turn if $H_0$ focuses on $A_3$. But for now, UP is the best placement.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

If $H_0$ had moved DOWN to $(6, 4)$, $H_0$ would have died hitting $B_1$.\nHowever, the actual board state provided at the start of this turn (Turn 6) shows:\n$H_1$ is at (7, 5), $B_1=[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$. (This implies $H_1$ *did* eat something on Turn 5, which contradicts the actual score update shown at the start of Turn 6: Score 1 vs 2).\n\n**Re-evaluating Turn 5 based on provided Turn 6 data:**\nT5 Start State (Deducing from T6 Data):\n$H_1$: (7, 4), $B_1$: [(6, 4)]. Apples: 1. (This means $H_1$ *did not* eat on T5, as body size is 2, 1 apple collected).\n$H_0$: (6, 5), $B_0$: [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. Apples: 2. (This implies $H_0$ *did* eat on T4, gaining 1 apple, body size 3. If $H_0$ ate on T4, its previous body would have been size 2 + 1 segment, total 3. If $H_0$ did not eat on T5, its tail segment should have dropped if it existed, but based on $B_0$, $H_0$ is large).\n\nThe score update in T6 ($S_1$: 1 apple, $S_0$: 2 apples) indicates:\n1. On T5, $H_1$ did NOT eat an apple.\n2. On T5, $H_0$ did NOT eat an apple.\n\nIf $H_1$ did not eat on T5, my move must have been safe, and the T4 rationale choice (UP) must have been safe relative to the previous position $H_1(7, 4)$.\nIf $H_1(7, 4)$ moved UP to $(7, 5)$, and didn't eat, the tail segment $(6, 4)$ remains. So $B_1=[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$. This matches the inferred $H_1$ state for T6 ($H_1(7, 5), B_1=[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$) except the provided $B_1$ shows $[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$. Wait, the provided size is 3 segments total. If size is 3, $H_1$ collected 2 apples total.\nT5 Rationale said: If $H_1$ ate (7, 4) last turn (T4), $S_1=2$.\n\n**CRITICAL DISCREPANCY:** The score update shown in the *previous* rationale (T5) stated $S_1=2$, but the score update shown *here* (T6) states $S_1=1$. I MUST rely on the state presented at the beginning of Turn 6.\n\n**Current State (Turn 6 Start):**\n$H_1$: (7, 5), $B_1$: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. (Length 3. Apples collected: 2, based on length 3 minus 1 starting cell).\n$H_0$: (6, 5), $B_0$: [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. (Length 3. Apples collected: 2, based on length 3 minus 1 starting cell).\nScores: $S_1=1, S_0=2$. **This implies my snake has collected 1 apple, and $H_0$ has collected 2.**\nIf $S_1=1$, length should be 2. If $H_1$ is length 3 (Head + 2 body), $S_1=2$.\n\n**Resolving Length vs Score:** I must prioritize the provided Head/Body definitions and the relative score difference ($S_0$ leads by 1).\nActual Length: $H_1$ length = 3 (1 apple collected if total length is $L$), $H_0$ length = 3.\nIf initial length is 1, $L = 1 + A$. $H_1$ length 3 -> $A_1=2$. $H_0$ length 3 -> $A_0=2$.\nThe provided scores $S_1=1, S_0=2$ contradict the body lengths shown, assuming standard starting length 1.\n\n**Assumption Override:** I will proceed based on the physical board state provided for Turn 6, and note that the target apple count is $S_0$ ahead by 1. I assume the move made on T5 (which was UP) was successful, and resulted in $H_1(7, 5), B_1=[(7, 4), (6, 4)]$ (Length 3). I must assume $S_1=2$ and $S_0=2$ for strategic parity, or follow the explicit score $S_1=1, S_0=2$. Given the uncertainty, I will target the nearest apples and self-preservation.\n\n**Target Apples:** $A_1(5, 1)$, $A_2(4, 9)$, $A_3(0, 5)$, $A_4(0, 4)$, $A_5(6, 0)$.\n$H_1(7, 5)$. Nearest: $A_1(5, 1)$ is far. $A_2(4, 9)$ is far. No immediate apple.\n\n**Enemy position:** $H_0(6, 5)$. $H_0$ is adjacent to $S_1$'s head cell (7, 5) via the horizontal axis.\n$B_1$: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]. $B_0$: [(7, 6), (7, 5)].\n\n**Safety Check for $H_1(7, 5)$:**\n1. **Move UP (7, 6):**\n   *   $H_0$ is at (6, 5). Move UP (7, 6) collides with $B_0$ segment (7, 6) if $H_0$ moved in T5 based on $H_0(6, 6), B_0=[(7, 6)]$ and it moved DOWN/LEFT/UP without eating.\n   *   Let's check $H_0$'s potential moves from (6, 5) given $B_0=[(7, 6), (7, 5)]$ (meaning $H_0$ must have stayed in place or moved in a way that retained (7, 5) and (7, 6) in its body, which is impossible for a single move unless it ate and then immediately lost a segment, or the body list is simply wrong again).\n   *   If we trust $H_0$'s current body is [(7, 6), (7, 5)], this structure suggests $H_0$ must have moved right into (6, 5) on the T5 move *and* eaten, thereby extending its tail to (7, 5) and retaining (7, 6). But $S_0$ did not increase if $S_0=2$ now. This state documentation is highly suspect, but we MUST calculate safety based on this configuration.\n\nAssuming $H_0$ moves from (6, 5) and does not eat (since $S_0$ isn't increasing):\n*   $H_0$ UP $\\rightarrow (6, 6)$. $H_1$ UP $\\rightarrow (7, 6)$. Safe.\n*   $H_0$ DOWN $\\rightarrow (6, 4)$. This cell is $B_1$ segment (6, 4). **$H_0$ dies! Instant Win for $S_1$.**\n*   $H_0$ LEFT $\\rightarrow (5, 5)$. Safe.\n*   $H_0$ RIGHT $\\rightarrow (7, 5)$. **Head-on collision with $H_1$ at (7, 5)! Simultaneous Death (Draw).**\n\nIf $H_0$ is rational, it avoids moving RIGHT (Draw) and DOWN (Death). $H_0$ chooses UP (6, 6) or LEFT (5, 5).\nIf $H_0$ moves LEFT to (5, 5), it aims for $A_1(5, 1)$ or positions towards $A_3(0, 5)$.\nIf $H_0$ moves UP to (6, 6), it stays central.\n\nMove UP (7, 6): If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (5, 5), we are now adjacent to each other vertically, which is good for defense, but we have no apples nearby. If $H_0$ moves UP to (6, 6), pressure is maintained.\n\n2. **Move DOWN (7, 4):**\n   *   This moves $H_1$ onto $B_1$ segment (7, 4). **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Cannot move DOWN.\n\n3. **Move LEFT (6, 5):**\n   *   This moves $H_1$ onto $H_0$ head at (6, 5). **Simultaneous Death (Draw).** Cannot move LEFT.\n\n4. **Move RIGHT (8, 5):**\n   *   Safe move, moves towards the boundary, away from $H_0$ and any imminent apples. Passive.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only UP (7, 6) and RIGHT (8, 5) are safe moves, assuming $H_0$ is rational and avoids self-termination (DOWN to 6, 4) or mutual destruction (RIGHT to 7, 5).\n\nIf we choose UP (7, 6): We position ourselves adjacent to $H_0$ if it stays put or moves UP. We aim to pressure $H_0$ into moving into the kill zone $(6, 4)$ next turn, or force it to give up the center.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT (8, 5): We retreat passively. $H_0$ will likely move LEFT to (5, 5) or UP to (6, 6), positioning itself well for future apples.\n\nSince $H_0$ has a guaranteed death move available (DOWN to (6, 4)), an aggressive move like UP applies maximum positional pressure, forcing $H_0$ to choose between yielding territory (UP/LEFT) or mutual destruction (RIGHT). UP seems the best option to maintain proximity to $H_0$ while staying safe from the immediate body segment (6, 4).\n\nStrategy Note: Continue to maintain pressure on $H_0$. The current board state strongly suggests $H_0$ has a fatal vulnerability if it aims for self-destruction prevention. We aim for the apple at (5, 1) next, or maintain central control.\n\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**",

It exploits the fact that $H_0$ still risks hitting $B_1$ at (7, 5) or (6, 4) if it tries moving towards $H_1$ or towards the center low area. This is aggressive control.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 6):** Passive retreat. Gives up central control. $H_0$ will likely respond by moving towards central apples or positionally advantageous spots.\n\nGiven the immediate vulnerability of $H_0$ to hitting $B_1$ cells, UP seems the most potent move to force an early win or force $H_0$ into a less favorable configuration. If $H_0$ moves to (6, 6) or (5, 5), we have achieved relative safety for the upcoming turn, while maintaining proximity to the action.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Exploit $H_0$'s potential structural weakness (adjacent to $B_1$ segments (7, 5) and (6, 4)). Try to force $H_0$ into a corner or force it to hit a segment. If $H_0$ avoids confrontation, we circle back towards the apples, prioritizing (4, 9) or (0, 5) next, depending on position. Given $H_1$ is currently high up at (7, 6), moving UP to (7, 7) maintains altitude for surveying the board.\n\nUP",

Body: [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. (Length 4)\n*   S0 Head: (6, 5). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. (Length 3)\n\n**My Move Choice for Turn 7: UP -> New Head (7, 7).

Possible moves: (5, 5), (7, 5), (6, 4), (6, 6).\nS1 Body segments potentially blocking/killing S0: (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4).\n\n1.  If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 4): Hits S1 body. S0 dies. S1 wins instantly. (This was the intended trap in my rationale).\n2.  If S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 5): Hits S1 body. S0 dies. S1 wins instantly.\n3.  If S0 moves UP to (6, 6): Safe relative to S1 body segments listed above IF S1's tail didn't grow. If S1 didn't eat, its tail (6, 4) remains, and (7, 5) is part of the body.\n4.  If S0 moves LEFT to (5, 5): Safe relative to S1 body segments listed above.\n\nSince the game did not end, $H_0$ must have chosen a move that survived. S0 must have moved to (6, 6) or (5, 5).\n\n**Case A: S0 moved UP to (6, 6).**\nS1 State: $H_1(7, 7)$, $B_1$: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\nS0 State: $H_0(6, 6)$, $B_0$: [(6, 5), (7, 6)]. (S0 only grows if it ate an apple, which it didn't, so tail shrinks). Wait, S0 had 2 apples (Score 2). Length 3 implies 2 previous apples. Tail should shrink by 1 cell *unless* the move resulted in an apple gain. No apples were at (6, 6) or (5, 5). So $B_0$ shrinks.\n$B_0$ previous: [(7, 6), (7, 5)]. New $B_0$: [(6, 5)]. (Length 2).\n\n**Case B: S0 moved LEFT to (5, 5).**\nS1 State: $H_1(7, 7)$, $B_1$: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\nS0 State: $H_0(5, 5)$, $B_0$: [(6, 5)]. (Length 2).\n\nThe board state provided in the prompt for Turn 8 seems to reflect the state *after* the previous move (Turn 7) was registered, but this board state implies $H_1$ is at (7, 6) and $H_0$ is at (5, 3). **This contradicts the history provided.**\n\n**Crucial Realization:** The input block structure is showing:\n1. Turn/Apples/Scores (Current state check)\n2. Snake data (Current state check)\n3. Board State (Current state check)\n4. Last Move Information (What I did last time, and *why* I did it).\n\nThe initial data block (Turn: 7 / 150) reflects the state *before* my move choice (UP) at Turn 7.\nThe \"Your last move information\" block describes my choice at Turn 7 (UP) and the Rationale based on the state *before* Turn 7.\n\nI must assume the initial state block provided for Turn 8 is the *actual* current state after turn 7 concluded, regardless of whether my rationale perfectly predicted the opponent's move (as I cannot know their move until my move is executed).\n\n**Current State (Start of Turn 8: Based on initial provided block):**\nTurn: 7 / 150 (This suggests Turn 8 is about to proceed)\nApples: (4, 9), (0, 5), (5, 1), (6, 0), (0, 4)\nS1 (Me): Head (7, 7). Body [(7, 6)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2)\nS0 (Enemy): Head (5, 3). Body [(5, 4), (5, 5)]. Apples: 2. (Length 3)\n\n**Error Check:** The initial state provided for Turn 8 (Head at (7, 7), Body [(7, 6)]) means my move UP at Turn 7 landed me at (7, 7) AND I must have eaten an apple at (6, 6) or (7, 6) or (7, 7) to have grown to length 2 from length 1 (assuming base length 1), OR the previous state description was significantly wrong.\n\nLet's trust the provided board state and snake data exactly as presented for Turn 8:\n$H_1 = (7, 7)$\n$B_1 = [(7, 6)]$\n$H_0 = (5, 3)$\n$B_0 = [(5, 4), (5, 5)]$\n\nMy previous move (Turn 7) was UP from $(7, 6)$ to $(7, 7)$. This was safe. If I ate an apple, my length would increase. Since my body is just $[(7, 6)]$, it means either:\na) I ate nothing, and my body shifted: Previous $H_1=(7, 6)$, $B_1'=[(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]$. If I moved UP to (7, 7) and ate nothing, new body would be $[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]$. This contradicts the provided list $[(7, 6)]$.\n\nb) The provided board state reflects the consequences of simultaneous movement in Turn 7, and I did gain length 1 (since Score is 1, but length is 2, suggesting 1 apple eaten on *this* move or before if base length is 1). If S1 started Turn 7 at (7, 6) with length 1 (i.e., [(7, 5)] tail), and moved UP to (7, 7) eating an apple, $H_1=(7, 7), B_1=[(7, 6), (7, 5)]$. This contradicts the provided $B_1=[(7, 6)]$.\n\n**Conclusion on State Integrity:** The state provided for the start of Turn 8 (H1=(7, 7), B1=[(7, 6)]) fundamentally contradicts the move stated in the rationale (UP from (7, 6)). I will disregard the Turn 7 Rationale/Moves and proceed based *only* on the currently listed state for Turn 8 initialization.\n\n**Current Setup (Turn 8):**\n$H_1 = (7, 7)$, $B_1 = [(7, 6)]$. Safe move locations: (6, 7), (8, 7), (7, 8), (7, 6) [Backwards].\n$H_0 = (5, 3)$, $B_0 = [(5, 4), (5, 5)]$.\n\n**Target Apples:** (4, 9) is closest to the top, but (0, 5) and (0, 4) are nearby corner apples. (5, 1) and (6, 0) are low down.\nA reachable apple seems to be (4, 9) or (0, 5). (7, 7) is positioned well to head towards (4, 9).\n\n**Safety Analysis for $H_1(7, 7)$:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (7, 8):** Safe from own body. Next target (4, 9) is 1 unit away.\n2.  **Move DOWN (7, 6):** Hits body $B_1$. Die. UNSAFE.\n3.  **Move LEFT (6, 7):** Safe from own body. Moves towards center top.\n4.  **Move RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe from own body. Moves towards edge.\n\n**Enemy Interaction (S0: H0(5, 3)):** S0 is far away and moving towards the bottom left corner area based on its position (5, 3) and body length 3. S0 is unlikely to interfere immediately unless it moves aggressively towards my high position.\n\nIf S0 moves UP (5, 4): Hits $B_0$. Die.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (6, 3): Safe.\nIf S0 moves DOWN (5, 2): Safe.\nIf S0 moves LEFT (4, 3): Safe.\n\nSince S0 is not an immediate threat, the priority shifts to positioning and apple acquisition. The closest high apple is (4, 9). Moving towards it seems sensible. (7, 7) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9) is a direct path.\n\n**Evaluating Moves towards (4, 9):**\nWe are at (7, 7). We need to move left (to 4) and up (to 9).\n\n*   **Option UP (7, 8):** Excellent move. Keeps us high, closer to the (4, 9) apple by one vertical step. S0 is unlikely to reach us.\n*   **Option LEFT (6, 7):** Puts us in position to move LEFT again next turn.\n\nIf we go UP (7, 8), next turn we can go LEFT to (6, 8) then (5, 8) toward the apple.\nIf we go LEFT (6, 7), next turn we can go UP to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 7) toward the apple.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good for positioning towards (4, 9). UP maintains the advantage of being high up, making it slightly harder for S0 to cut us off from the corner apples quickly if it decides to move up board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Target apple (4, 9). Move UP to (7, 8) to secure vertical position, then start moving horizontally towards X=4 utilizing the top boundary. Since S0 seems occupied low/center, we focus on securing the high apple uncontested.\n\nUP\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Target apple (4, 9). Move UP to (7, 8). Next turn, move towards X=4 (LEFT/RIGHT depending on ideal approach angle once at Y=9 or Y=8). Monitor S0's movement, but anticipate safety for several turns.\nUP",

Standard procedure is to trust the textual data defining snake coordinates over a possibly misdrawn visualization if ambiguity exists, but the visualization shows a snake structure that is completely different: Length 3 at (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6).\n\nLet's trust the textual definition provided for the snakes:\n$H_1 = (7, 7)$, $B_1 = [(7, 6)]$.

S0 cannot reach (7, 7) or its immediate neighbors in one move. S0's likely targets are (5, 1) or (6, 0).

Length 2. Score 1.\n$H_0 = (5, 1)$, $B_0 = [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]$. Length 4. Score 3. (S0 must have eaten an apple last turn, moving from (5, 3) to (5, 1), which implies it ate (5, 1) if it was there, or (5, 1) was the target).\nWait, the apples list for Turn 9 is: (4, 9), (0, 5), (6, 0), (0, 4), (3, 2). (5, 1) is **not** an apple. This suggests S0 ate an apple previously that is now missing, OR $H_0$ landed on an empty spot, and the board visualization is slightly delayed or misaligned regarding score/body update vs movement.\n\nLet's assume the coordinates given for Turn 9 are accurate for the start of the calculations for Move 9, regardless of how they were achieved in Move 8:\n$H_1 = (7, 9)$. Body segments are (7, 8). Tail is off-board or not listed if length is > 2. Since score is 1, length should be 2. $L_1 = 2$.\n$H_0 = (5, 1)$. Body segments are (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4). Length 4. Score 3.\n\n**Objective:** Target Apple (4, 9).\n\n**Analysis of $H_1(7, 9)$ Moves:**\n1.  **UP (7, 10):** Off board. **DANGEROUS/KILL.**\n2.  **DOWN (7, 8):** Hits my own body ($B_1$). **DANGEROUS/KILL.**\n3.  **LEFT (6, 9):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 9):** Safe. Moves toward edge.\n\nOnly MOVE LEFT (6, 9) is immediately safe among the four cardinal directions, as moving UP is illegal (off board) and moving DOWN is illegal (into self).\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT (6, 9):**\n*   My head moves to (6, 9). $B_1$ remains [(7, 8)]. No body collision.\n*   Check for collisions with $H_0(5, 1)$. $H_0$ moves this turn.\n\n**Enemy $H_0(5, 1)$ Move Analysis:**\nS0 is far away from me (7, 9). S0 must be aiming for an apple or running away.\nAvailable Apples for S0: (4, 9), (0, 5), (6, 0), (0, 4), (3, 2).\nS0 is at Y=1. Nearest apples are (6, 0) and (3, 2). (3, 2) is closer in Manhattan distance (2) than (6, 0) (4 moves).\n\nIf S0 moves towards (3, 2):\n*   S0 might move LEFT to (4, 1) or DOWN to (5, 0).\n*   If S0 moves LEFT to (4, 1), distance to (6, 9) is large.\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (5, 0), distance to (6, 9) is large.\n\nIt is highly unlikely S0 can reach (6, 9) in one move, or even in two moves that would intersect my path on Turn 10. Safety is high for moving LEFT.\n\n**Strategy Evaluation (LEFT to 6, 9):**\nMoving LEFT puts me one step closer to the highest priority apple (4, 9).\n$H_1$ moves to (6, 9). If S0 moves toward (3, 2) (e.g., DOWN to (5, 0) or LEFT to (4, 1)), I maintain positional advantage for the next turn to move again towards X=4.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 9):\nNext turn (T10), $H_1=(6, 9)$. Safe moves include (5, 9), (7, 9), (6, 8). (5, 9) targets (4, 9) optimally.\n\nIf I were somehow able to move toward (4, 9) faster than LEFT, that would be preferred, but UP/DOWN are blocked, and RIGHT moves away from the target X coordinate.\n\nLEFT is the only safe, forward-progressing move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nPrioritize securing apple (4, 9) immediately. Move LEFT to (6, 9). If successful, the next move will be toward (5, 9) or (7, 9) depending on S0's movements, aiming to land on (4, 9) on Turn 11 or 12 at the latest. Maintain distance from S0, which seems focused on the lower half of the board for now.\n\nLEFT",

If it ate an apple, its length should be 5.*\n\n**Reconciling State Discrepancy:**\nT9 Start: $H_1=(7, 9)$, $B_1=[(7, 8)]$. $H_0=(5, 1)$, $B_0=[(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]$.

Length 4.\nS0's state T10 Start: $H_0=(6, 1)$, $B_0=[(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$. Length 4.\nSince S0's body changed from $[(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]$ to $[(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$ AND its head moved from (5, 1) to (6, 1), this implies S0 **DID NOT** eat an apple last turn (T9). It simply moved RIGHT, and its tail segment (5, 4) was dropped. This confirms S0 is operating with length 4, matching score 3 (meaning it ate 3 apples total previously).\n\n**Current Positions (T10 Start):**\n$H_1 = (6, 9)$. $B_1 = [(7, 9)]$. $L_1 = 2$. Target Apple: (4, 9).\n$H_0 = (6, 1)$. $B_0 = [(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$. $L_0 = 4$.\n\n**Immediate Threats Check:**\n1.

Closer to target (4, 9).\n    * RIGHT (7, 9): Hits body segment $B_1=(7, 9)$. **KILL.**\nSafe moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\n2. Collision with Enemy ($H_0=(6, 1)$):\nSince movement is simultaneous, we must predict $H_0$'s move.\nApples nearest to S0 (6, 1): (6, 0) [1 away, Down], (3, 2) [3 away].\nS0 likely targets (6, 0).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 0): $H_0' = (6, 0)$. This move is necessary for S0 to score soon.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 9): I am safe from $H_0'=(6, 0)$.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 8): I am safe from $H_0'=(6, 0)$.\n\n**Strategic Choice Comparison (LEFT vs DOWN):**\nTarget Apple: (4, 9). Best path trajectory is decreasing X coordinate.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 9):** Moves one step closer to (4, 9). Allows (4, 9) to be reached in 2 more turns (T11).\n    *   $H_1'=(5, 9)$. $B_1'=[(6, 9)]$.\n    *   Next move can be LEFT to (4, 9) if S0 doesn't block or eat it first.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 8):** Moves away from the X target (4, 9). Safety does not improve significantly compared to LEFT, as both are safe from predicted S0 movement.\n    *   $H_1'=(6, 8)$. $B_1'=[(7, 9)]$.\n\nMoving LEFT is clearly superior as it maintains forward momentum towards the highest priority apple (4, 9).\n\n**Predicting S0's next move (T11):**\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 0) this turn (T10). $H_0'=(6, 0)$. $B_0'=[(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$. Length 4 (tail dropped).\nIf S0 eats (6, 0), $L_0$ becomes 5.\nIf S0 eats (6, 0), $H_0''$ on T11 will be moving from (6, 0). It might target (3, 2).\n\nBy moving to (5, 9), I prepare to strike (4, 9) on T11. I am currently 2 steps away (6, 9) -> (5, 9) -> (4, 9). If S0 is busy moving towards the bottom of the board, this is a perfect opportunity.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving towards (4, 9) using LEFT moves when possible, or UP/DOWN maneuvering to stay safe or stay on course. Avoid proximity collisions with S0, which seems focused low initially.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Prioritize reaching apple (4, 9). Move LEFT to (5, 9) this turn to close the gap. On T11, aim for (4, 9). Monitor S0's movements; if S0 clears the bottom apples rapidly, re-evaluate trajectory towards remaining apples (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 2).\n\nLEFT",

(This matches the rationale summary: S0 Score 3 at T10 start, now Score 4).\nIf S0 ate (6, 0) on T10, its movement was DOWN: $(6, 1) \\to (6, 0)$. Eating occurred.\nS0 state T11 Start (Based on Board + Score logic):\n$H_0=(6, 0)$. $L_0=5$. $B_0=[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]$ (assuming old tail (5, 3) remains and a new one appears, or the old tail (5, 3) shifts).\nThe symbol in the board for S0 segments is 'T' (Tail/Body). Let's re-examine the board segment locations for S0:\n(6, 0) Head 0.\nSegments at: (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3). If S0 ate, it should have length 5. The board visualization only clearly shows 4 body segments plus the head.\nThe visualization shows: '0' at (6, 0). Then segments T at (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3). Wait, $(3, 2)$ is an apple 'A'. $(3, 3)$ is perhaps an implied segment? No.\nLet's trust the explicit list provided for S0 in the header:\n**Snake #0 - Head: (6, 0), Body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)], Apples: 4**\nThis indicates $L_0 = 4$, meaning S0 did *not* grow on T10, despite its score increasing from 3 to 4. This suggests the scoring/length tracking is inconsistent, or S0 must have eaten something on a previous move that is not reflected in the body list length, OR the board visualization is showing the state *before* the tail segment was dropped (which contradicts score/length logic).\n\nGiven the score is 4, S0 must have length 5 at least. If its body list provided is accurate, it implies S0 *lost* 1 segment while gaining 1 apple, which is impossible unless it moved into a hazard it survived (not applicable here) or the list provided is slightly truncated/incorrect for the current state.\n\n**Crucial realization: The snake lengths should correspond to $Score+1$.**\nS1: Score 1 $\\implies L_1=2$. (Matches $H_1(5, 9), B_1(6, 9)$).\nS0: Score 4 $\\implies L_0=5$.\nThe provided list $H_0(6, 0), B_0[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$ has length 4.\n\n**Assumption for safety:** S0 *is* length 5, operating somewhere unseen, OR its functional length in determining self-collision is 4 based on the provided list, OR the game logic dictates only the listed segments matter for collision. Since standard rules apply, I must assume S0 is length 5, and its list is missing the 5th segment. Which cell would it be? If it ate $(6, 0)$ coming from $(6, 1)$, its previous tail (which was (5, 3) based on T10 state, *if* T10 state was correct) must have been dropped if it didn't eat. But it did eat.\n\nIf S0 ate (6, 0) coming from (6, 1), $B_0$ should have been initialized from $B_{T10} = [(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$.\nMove: $(6, 1) \\to (6, 0)$ [EAT].\nNew Body: $[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), \\text{NEW TAIL}]$.\nThe provided list $B_0=[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$ is missing the new tail segment. If we assume the new tail is implied to be $(5, 4)$ because S0 moved from $H_0=(6, 1)$ and its previous tail (T10) was $(5, 3)$, and $(5, 3)$ is now the 4th body piece, the new tail would be $(5, 4)$.\n**Hypothesized S0 State (L=5): $H_0=(6, 0), B_0=[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]$**\n\n---\n\n**My Moves (H1=(5, 9), B1=[(6, 9)]):**\nTarget: Apple (4, 9).\n\n1. **LEFT (4, 9):** Moves onto A(4, 9).\n    *   $H_1'=(4, 9)$. Grow! $L_1=3$.

(6, 1) is listed in $B_0$. **S0 dies if it moves UP.**\n*   DOWN (6, -1): Off board. **Suicide.**\n*   LEFT (5, 0): Safe move.\n*   RIGHT (7, 0): Safe move.\n\nIf S0 dies by moving UP (6, 1), I win immediately (assuming no other snakes).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0), I am safe at (4, 9).\n\nMoving LEFT to eat (4, 9) is the best aggressive move. It yields a point, increases length, and forces S0 into a difficult spot where moving UP leads to immediate death based on its provided body list $B_0=[(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]$.\n\nLet's verify if S0 could move UP and not die, maybe my list interpretation of S0 is wrong again.\nS0 Body list: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)].\nIf H0=(6, 0) moves UP to (6, 1), it collides with (6, 1). This means S0 MUST NOT move UP.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 0), then:\nH1' = (4, 9) [EAT]\nH0' = (5, 0)\nNo collision. I eat the apple. This is an excellent result.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 0), then:\nH1' = (4, 9) [EAT]\nH0' = (7, 0)\nNo collision. I eat the apple. This is an excellent result.\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN (impossible, off-board).\n\nConclusion: Moving LEFT targets the highest priority apple and puts pressure on S0 by eliminating its ability to move UP safely based on the provided body definition. This is the highest expected reward move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure Apple (4, 9). Then re-evaluate trajectory towards remaining apples: (0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 2), (9, 9). (0, 5) and (0, 4) are now significantly closer than (3, 2). Aiming towards the left edge seems next.\n\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**",

(Tail at (6, 9) has been dropped if I didn't eat last turn, but looking at the visual $9 . . . . 1 T T . . A$, it seems the move LEFT resulted in $H_1=(5, 9), B_1=[(6, 9)]$. This implies my length is 2, and my tail was dropped from (6, 9) - wait, my T10 move was LEFT from (6, 9) to (5, 9). $H_{T10}=(6, 9), B_{T10}=[(7, 9)]$. Move LEFT $\\to H_1=(5, 9), B_1=[(6, 9)]$. My length remains 2. This is consistent with the score of 2 despite the board showing A at (4, 9) being missed/not present yet, potentially because the visualization provided corresponds to the state *after* the move if the move was successful in capturing the apple *or* the apple list is correct and the visualization is slightly outdated regarding the apple positions derived from the initial input list for T12.)\n\nApples: A = {(0, 5), (0, 4), (3, 2), (9, 9), (9, 4)}. The apple at (4, 9) mentioned in the T11 Rationale is *not* in the T12 apple list, but the apple at (9, 9) is. I must prioritize the provided Apple list for T12.\n\nMy next target apple is (9, 9), followed by (9, 4). (0, 5)/(0, 4) are far away.\n\nEnemy Snake #0: Head: (6, 0), Body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]. Score: 4. Length: 5 (inferred).\nS0 segment locations: (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3). (Only 4 body segments listed, inconsistent with score 4 => length 5. As analyzed last turn, moving UP from (6, 0) into (6, 1) is a collision based on this list.)\n\n**Safety Check (My potential moves from H1=(5, 9), B1=[(6, 9)]):**\n\n1.  **UP (5, 10):** Off board. **Dead.**\n2.  **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe from self.

Target: None.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9):** **Collision!** Hits my body at (6, 9). **Dead.**\n\nOnly DOWN and LEFT are safe moves regarding self-collision.\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (S0 H0=(6, 0)):**\nS0 is trapped if it moves UP into (6, 1).\n*   If S0 moves UP (6, 1): S0 dies (hits its body segment at (6, 1) based on the list provided).\n*   If S0 moves DOWN (6, -1): Dead (off board).\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (5, 0): Safe.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT (7, 0): Safe.\n\nSince S0 has many options to survive by moving LEFT or RIGHT, I cannot rely on S0 dying unless I can force it.\n\n**Goal Selection:**\nThe nearest viable apple is (9, 9). My current position (5, 9) is reasonably placed to start moving towards the right edge. Moving left to (4, 9) takes me further away from (9, 9).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 8):** Maintains path towards the right side of the board, positioning me for future moves toward (9, 9) and (9, 4). S0 is likely to move sideways (5, 0 or 7, 0). This seems like a solid, non-committal safe move that keeps the long-term goal active.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 9):** Avoids the dead-end at (6, 9), but moves away from my primary target (9, 9). This is only useful if I intended to sweep the left side first, which seems inefficient right now.\n\nI will choose DOWN to move centrally and start moving towards the high-value apples on the right side, ensuring safety this turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure a path towards the right edge (9, 9) and (9, 4). Avoid the left edge cluster (0, 5), (0, 4) until the right side is cleared or S0 is eliminated/occupied elsewhere. Maintain maximum distance from S0's current location (6, 0) unless an immediate collision opportunity arises for S0.\n\nMy move will be DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Body segments appear at (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0).\nIf S0 was at (3, 0) last turn (as deduced in rationale) and moved UP to (3, 1), this is consistent.\n\n**Safety Check (My potential moves from H1=(6, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe from self.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe from self.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 8):** **Collision!** Hits my body at (5, 8). **Dead.** (Note: Moving backwards into the immediately preceding head position is fatal).\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe from self.\n\nSafe moves for me: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Prediction Check (S0 H0=(3, 1)):**\nS0's body segments are at (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0). Note: S0 gained an apple since the head is at Y=1 and 4 apples are collected, suggesting its tail has not retracted yet, or it ate an apple off-screen, but we must follow the given body coordinates.\n\nS0 possible moves from (3, 1):\n*   **UP (3, 2): Collision!** Hits apple (3, 2) and likely grows, but does it hit anything else? Safe from existing body.\n*   **DOWN (3, 0): Collision!** Hits S0's body at (3, 0). **Dead.**\n*   **LEFT (2, 1):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 1):** Safe.\n\nS0 must avoid DOWN. Best moves are likely UP or RIGHT, aiming to sweep the bottom/middle area. If S0 moves UP to (3, 2), it eats an apple, gains length, and focuses on the lower half of the board.\n\n**Goal Selection & Collision Avoidance:**\nMy goal is still (9, 9) or (9, 4). My current position (6, 8) is excellent for moving right.\n\n1.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Moves me closer to column 9. Since S0 is predicted to move UP, RIGHT, or LEFT (staying low/middle), moving right keeps us separated vertically (S0 max Y=2 or 3, me at Y=8). This maximizes progress towards the high X targets.\n2.  **UP (6, 9):** Good vertical progress, but moving right seems more crucial now given we just moved right one square, and high X apples are waiting.\n3.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Moves away from Y=9 apple.\n\nChoosing RIGHT (7, 8) is the most direct path towards the X=9 apples while maintaining significant separation from S0, which appears focused on the lower half of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving RIGHT towards (9, 9). If the path to (9, 9) becomes congested or if S0 starts climbing high, switch priority to (9, 4) or adapt. Do not move LEFT until the board is more open or necessary for survival.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nTurn: 15 / 150\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\nMy Snake (ID 1): Head: (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8)].

Let's re-check S0's movement structure.)\n\n*Last Turn Check (Turn 16):* S0 Head was (3, 2). Body was [(3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]. If S0 moved safely, its new head (2, 2) implies it moved LEFT from (3, 2).\nIf S0 moved LEFT: New Body: [(2, 2) Neck] -> [(3, 2) old head] -> [(3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)].\nThe provided state for Turn 17 shows: S0 Head: (2, 2), Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)].\nThis means S0 moved **LEFT** from (3, 2) to (2, 2). The tail (5, 0) was dropped, and the new head (2, 2) is the first element. The rest follow. This looks like a standard move where it did not eat an apple. The cell (3, 2) is now occupied by S0's neck.\n\nS0 potential moves from H0=(2, 2):\n1. UP (2, 3): Safe.\n2. DOWN (2, 1): Safe.\n3. LEFT (1, 2): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 2): **Collision!** Hits its own body segment at (3, 2). **Dead.**\n\nS0 Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. S0 is focused on the lower left area (Y<=3, X<=3). It poses no immediate threat to my position at (8, 8).\n\n**Goal Selection & Strategy:**\nMy primary goal is (9, 9) or (9, 4). I am at (8, 8). Moving RIGHT (to 9, 8) is the optimal choice to quickly reach these targets.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8):\nNext turn, I can move UP to (9, 9) and eat the first apple, or move DOWN to (9, 7) to prepare for (9, 4) if (9, 9) is occupied or risky.\n\nMoving UP (to 8, 9) delays reaching the X=9 boundary.\nMoving DOWN (to 8, 7) seems less direct towards the clustered apples.\n\nI confirm RIGHT is the best move for immediate progress toward the top-right apple (9, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nPush towards the right edge (X=9). Target (9, 9) first. If (9, 9) is unsafe or consumed, proceed to (9, 4). Continue maintaining distance from S0 in the lower left quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving left moves me towards the main cluster of apples on the left edge.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nStay alive by prioritizing safe moves. Move LEFT to (8, 9).

(Note: The body provided in the overview section seems to reflect the state *after* the previous move, which was calculated as LEFT. Let's verify based on last move info: Last move was LEFT from (9, 9) -> (8, 9). If the apple was eaten, the snake grew. The provided body in the setup: Head: (8, 9), Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. This means the snake moved from (9, 9) to (8, 9). Since the apple count is still 3, it seems the (9, 9) was eaten on move 19, but the board state input seems slightly inconsistent with the rationale provided for Turn 19, which stated the apple at (9, 9) was just eaten.\n\nLet's reconcile the state based on the provided input for Turn 20, which overrides previous assumptions if contradictory:\n*   **Current Head:** (8, 9).\n*   **Current Body:** [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. (Length 4, if we assume the head (8, 9) replaces the tail segment of length 3 from the previous turn + 1 new segment due to eating, or if the input simply describes the 4 segments present now).\n*   **Last move rationale**: Selected LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9). If an apple was present at (9, 9) (which was listed in the input for T19), and the move was safe, the snake should have grown. The score remained 3.\n\nLooking at the board state provided for Turn 20:\nBoard shows (9, 9) as '1 T'. This means S1's head was at (9, 9) at the start of Turn 19, and then (0, 9) is an apple 'A'.\nThe setup for Turn 20 shows:\nSnake ID 1: Head: (8, 9), Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. This implies the previous move *was* LEFT from (9, 9) to (8, 9), and the tail segment (7, 8) just dropped off, *or* the snake did not eat an apple last turn, despite the rationale suggesting one was eaten. Given the board state map confirms S1 is along the top edge: (8, 9) H, (9, 9) B, (9, 8) B, (8, 8) B. This structure suggests the length is 4.\n\nLet's proceed based on the *input state for Turn 20*:\nHead H1: (8, 9). Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. Neck (cell to avoid): (9, 9). Length: 4.\nApples A: (0, 5), (0, 4), (9, 4), (0, 9), (1, 9). (Wait, (0, 9) and (1, 9) are marked 'A' on the map, but (9, 9) is marked '1 T', suggesting an apple was there and was eaten, or it's just the new head position of snake 1). On the map: Row 9 shows A A . . . . . . 1 T. This means apples at (0, 9) and (1, 9), and S1 head at (8, 9) and tail segment at (9, 9). This confirms the snake body structure provided in the text: Head (8, 9), Body [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. The cell (9, 9) is occupied by the snake's body, matching the body list structure, not an apple.\n\n**Safe Moves Calculation for H1=(8, 9):**\nNeck for collision check: (9, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 10):** Off board. **Dead.**\n2.  **DOWN (8, 8):** Collision! Hits body segment at (8, 8). **Dead.**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 9):** Safe from self.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 9):** Collision! Hits body segment at (9, 9) (the neck). **Dead.** (Moving directly into the neck).\n\nOnly one safe move relative to self: **LEFT (7, 9)**.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 (S0) Analysis:**\nH0: (0, 3). Body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]. Length: 6.\n\nPotential target for S0: Apples at (0, 5), (0, 4). S0 is positioned well to approach these apples by moving UP.\n\nS0 Safe Moves (from H0=(0, 3)): Neck is (1, 2) (if S0 moved from (1, 2) previously, but we must check its actual body). Neck is the cell S0 came *from*. Since we don't know S0's last move, we check immediate self-collision on its current body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)].\n*   UP (0, 4): Safe. (Near apple A)\n*   DOWN (0, 2): Collision with body segment (0, 2). **Dead.**\n*   LEFT (X=-1): Off board. **Dead.**\n*   RIGHT (1, 3): Safe.\n\nS0 safe moves: UP (0, 4), RIGHT (1, 3).\n\n**Interaction Check (S1 moves LEFT to (7, 9)):**\nS1 move: (7, 9).\nS0 moves: (0, 4) OR (1, 3).\n\nNeither S0 predicted move lands on (7, 9).\nIf S0 moves UP to (0, 4), it eats an apple.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (1, 3), it moves towards the center.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe only move that keeps Snake 1 alive is LEFT. This move takes the snake towards the middle of the board along the top edge (7, 9). This is a mandatory move.\n\n**Goal Selection:**\nThe closest apples seem to be (0, 9) and (1, 9) (if they are truly apples, as marked 'A' on the map). My snake is at (8, 9). If (0, 9) and (1, 9) are apples, moving left gets me closer to them, but it's a long journey. (9, 4) is also reachable eventually.\n\nBy moving LEFT, I ensure survival on this turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nI am constrained to move LEFT (7, 9). From (7, 9), the options are usually LEFT (6, 9) or DOWN (7, 8), depending on enemy position and board constraints. S0 is moving down the left edge, probably aiming for apples there. I need to try and navigate towards the floating apple at (9, 4) or stay safe near the top edge until S0 moves away from the left side apples, allowing me to sweep them. For now, continue moving LEFT if safe, closing the gap on the top-left apples.\n\nLEFT\n\nP.S. Re-checking the map symbols for clarity:\n9 A A . . . . . . 1 T\n(0, 9) and (1, 9) are Apples (A). (8, 9) is S1 head (1), (9, 9) is S1 body segment (T). The body list [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)] confirms the snake position: (8, 9) H, (9, 9) B, (9, 8) B, (8, 8) B. This is length 4. Yes, the move LEFT from (8, 9) to (7, 9) is the only safe one.",

S0 is at (0, 5).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 8):** This moves S1 further away from all apples except potentially (6, 3) if S1 snakes down the board rapidly. It keeps S1 centered vertically. Since S0 is scoring heavily and dominating the lower left, moving away from the center-top area seems risky unless S0 is contained. S0 is not currently threatening the top edge. Moving DOWN might trap S1 near the bottom if S0 moves up.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 9):** This continues the movement along the top edge of the board, heading toward the apples at (0, 9) and (1, 9). This capitalizes on the high ground and initiates travel towards the available clusters of apples, aligning with the previous turn's general direction (though the move direction changed significantly due to the previous state).\n\nThe current focus should be moving towards the closest available apples. (0, 9) and (1, 9) are the closest grouping, significantly closer than (9, 4) or (8, 6). Moving LEFT (5, 9) is the best path toward these targets along the safe top edge.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=9 to reduce X coordinate towards 0, aiming for (1, 9) or (0, 9). If S0 does not interfere, we can assess moving down later, possibly around x=1 or x=0.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Prioritize LEFT moves to reach the upper left corner unless a clear opportunity to eat (8, 6) or (9, 4) emerges immediately while maintaining safe passage.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

New Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)].\n The provided current state shows: H:(4, 9), B:[(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. This means the body length is 5, and the tail (8,9) was *kept* OR an apple was eaten on the move LEFT.\n\n Checking last move choice: LEFT (4, 9).\n Since the resulting current state shows a body length of 5 (including the head), and the previous length was 4, an apple *must have been eaten* on Turn 23, resulting in a growth.\n If H=(5,9) moved LEFT to (4,9) and ate an apple, the new body should be [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)]. This matches the provided current body structure (if we include H:(4,9) as position 1, followed by 4 body segments).\n This implies Apple (0, 9) or (1, 9) was eaten. However, (0, 9) and (1, 9) are apples, and (4, 9) is the current head position. If the move LEFT from (5, 9) resulted in consuming an apple, the apple must have been at (4, 9).\n **There is no apple at (4, 9).

But the rationale chose LEFT, which was not toward an apple location.\n\n **I will proceed by analyzing moves based on the *current* state (Turn 24) and what the snake *should* do now, ignoring the implication that the previous move might have been flawed or that the resulting body state is inconsistent with the rationale provided.**\n\nCurrent State Analysis (T24):\nS1 Head H1: (4, 9).

S0 is currently positioned perfectly to reach (0, 9) by moving UP. If S0 moves UP, S1 needs to coordinate its move to either intercept the remaining apple at (1, 9) or continue moving left towards it safely.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 9):** This continues the path along the top edge ($y=9$). It brings S1 one step closer to (1, 9). If S0 moves UP to (0, 9), S0 gains a point and is now at (0, 9). S1 is at (2, 9). This looks like the best continuation of the previous strategy.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 8):** This moves S1 away from the immediate cluster of potential apples at $y=9$. This is less desirable unless the top path becomes blocked or immediately dangerous.\n\nSince the path LEFT offers immediate proximity to the remaining apple (1, 9) on the top row and keeps S1 away from S0's current vertical lane, LEFT is the preferred choice.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving LEFT along $y=9$ as long as possible to reach apple (1, 9). If (1, 9) is eaten/gone, re-evaluate based on remaining apples (6, 3), (8, 6), (9, 4) and S0's position. Maintain a safe distance from S0's vertical path ($x=0$).\n\nLEFT",

Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(0, 9))**\nS0 just ate A(0, 9) last turn (based on previous rationale suggesting S0 moved UP to (0, 9) and ate an apple). If S0 ate an apple, its body grows, and the tail does not disappear.\nS0 Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. Length 8. If it ate, its new body length is 9. The backward move target is (0, 8). Its previous head was (0, 8). If it ate, its body is now 9 cells long, and the tail is still at (1, 2) if it just grew, or the tail has moved relative to the assumed previous state.\n\n*Revisiting T25 state implication:* If S0 moved UP to (0, 9) and ate an apple, its previous head was (0, 8), body ended at (1, 2).\nOld S0: H(0, 8), B[(0, 7), ..., (1, 2)]. (8 segments)\nNew S0 if eaten: H(0, 9), B[(0, 8), (0, 7), ..., (1, 2), (cell before (1, 2))]. If it grew, the tail stays put. Its new body would be 9 segments long.\n\nLet's rely on the provided board representation for T26:\nBoard State (Y, X):\n(9, 0) T, (9, 1) A, (9, 2) 1, (9, 3) T, (9, 4) T, (9, 5) T, (9, 6) T, (9, 7) T\n(8, 0) T\n(7, 0) T\n(6, 0) T, (6, 8) A\n(5, 0) T\n(4, 0) T, (4, 9) A\n(3, 0) T, (3, 6) A\n(2, 0) T, (2, 1) T\n(0, 5) A\n\nS1 Head: (2, 9). Body: (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9). (5 segments = length 6). Wait, the board drawing contradicts the text body list provided in the rationale for T25, but the T26 text body list matches the T26 board drawing if we map Y/X:\nS1 Body list from Rationale (T25): [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 5 (4 body segments).\nCurrent S1 State (T26 based on initial text data): H:(2, 9), Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 6 (5 body segments).\nThis implies S1 moved LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9) last turn (T25), and did *not* eat, causing the tail (8, 9) from T24 to disappear, and the new head (2, 9) is linked to (3, 9). This confirms the standard movement where the tail segments shift forward unless an apple is eaten. S1 length is 6.\n\nS0 Head: (0, 9). Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. Length 8 (7 body segments).\nIf S0 ate (0, 9) on T25, its length increased to 9. The tail should still be (1, 2) and the segment before it is now (0, 2). The segment *added* would be (0, 9) itself, pushing its body one unit. This is confusing because the apple list has (1, 9) remaining, but the board shows A at (9, 1) [which is (1, 9) on a Y/X board if Y is row index], and A at (0, 9).\n\nLet's trust the *provided* S0 list and the board coordinates for T26 positions:\nApples: (9, 4)[Y=4, X=9], (1, 9)[Y=9, X=1], (8, 6)[Y=6, X=8], (6, 3)[Y=3, X=6], (5, 0)[Y=0, X=5].\nS0 Head: (0, 9) -> (X=0, Y=9). S0 Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)].\nThe board visualization shows S0 occupying X=0 columns from Y=2 to Y=9. This seems inconsistent with the coordinates if (X, Y) is standard Cartesian where Y increases going up.\nBoard X map: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nBoard Y=9 (top row): 9 0 A 1 T T T . . . .\nIf (0, 9) is head of S0, it's at the top left corner (X=0, Y=9). This matches the visualization better for S0 being the vertical column of Ts on the left edge.\n\nIf S0 is at H0=(0, 9), and previously moved UP to eat (0, 9) implying the apple list *before* the move was accurate: Apples: (9, 4), (0, 9), (1, 9), (8, 6), (6, 3). This means S0 ate A(0, 9) on T25.\nIf S0 grew, its new head is (0, 9). Its body segments are now 8 segments long + the new head cell (0, 9). The segment preceding (0, 8) must now be (0, 9), which is impossible. Growth means the new head location replaces the old head location (which moves into the body) and the tail is kept.\nOld H0: (0, 8). Old Tail: (1, 2).\nNew H0: (0, 9). New body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), ..., (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. Length 9. S0 must have moved UP onto the apple. The segment (0, 8) is now adjacent to (0, 9).\n\nWe have to assume S0's T26 state provided *is* the result of the move: H0=(0, 9), B=[(0, 8), (0, 7), ..., (1, 2)]. This implies S0 *did not* grow or its growth pattern differs, or the previous turn resulted in tail shedding despite eating. Given 8 apples collected, S0 likely *should* be longer. Since the provided body list only lists 7 body segments plus the head position (0, 9), total occupied cells = 8. If they had 8 apples, they should have 9 segments (Head + 8 body). This suggests S0 *shed its tail* on T25 even though it ate. This is often the case in implementations where growth is only +1 segment, regardless of the number accumulated, or the tail shed before growth was accounted for. We proceed with the provided geometry.\nS0 Backwards move target: (0, 8).\n\nS0 Potential moves (H0=(0, 9)):\n*   UP (0, 10): Off board $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   DOWN (0, 8): Hits own body segment (0, 8) $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   LEFT (-1, 9): Off board $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   RIGHT (1, 9): Hits Apple A(1, 9). Safe. (S0 eats apple)\n\nS0 Safe Moves: RIGHT ((1, 9) [Apple]).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 moves (D, L) vs S0 move (R))**\nS1 Safe Moves: D=(2, 8), L=(1, 9) [Apple]\nS0 Move: R=(1, 9) [Apple]\n\n**Case 1: S1 DOWN (2, 8) vs S0 RIGHT (1, 9)**\n*   No head-head collision. (2, 8) != (1, 9).\n*   No body collisions.\n$\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** (S0 eats apple)\n\n**Case 2: S1 LEFT (1, 9) vs S0 RIGHT (1, 9)**\n*   **HEAD-HEAD COLLISION!** Both attempt to move into (1, 9).\n$\\rightarrow$ **DEAD** (Both die)\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves for S1**\n\nThe move LEFT ((1, 9)) results in a shared death because S0 is also targeting (1, 9) to eat the apple there.\n\nThe only remaining safe move is DOWN to (2, 8).\n\n**5. Strategy Adjustment**\nS0 is moving in for the kill on A(1, 9). We cannot follow it there. Moving down to (2, 8) takes us off the top border, giving us space to maneuver and potentially approach apples (6, 3) or (8, 6) from a lower vantage point, while S0 consumes A(1, 9) and moves toward the right side of the board if it continues right.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (2, 8):\nS1: H(2, 8), B[(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 7.\nS0: H(1, 9) [eats apple], B now has 9 cells total, starting at (1, 9).\n\nThis move prioritizes survival over immediate apple consumption, as the only apple S1 could reach simultaneously resulted in mutual destruction.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move DOWN to (2, 8) to survive the collision at (1, 9). Since S0 is now heavily invested in the top edge (likely continuing right or around the top), we should start a downward trajectory to clear the board edge and aim for apples (6, 3) and (8, 6). (9, 4) is also available. We need to stay clear of X=0 where S0 dominates.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move DOWN to (2, 8) to survive the collision at (1, 9). Since S0 is now heavily invested in the top edge (likely continuing right or around the top), we should start a downward trajectory to clear the board edge and aim for apples (6, 3) and (8, 6). (9, 4) is also available. We need to stay clear of X=0 where S0 dominates.\n\nDOWN",

Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(1, 9))**\nS0 is currently positioned at the top right corner. S0 ate A(1, 9) on the last turn (T26) based on the rationale, and its body is now 10 segments long. Its previous head was (0, 9). The segment behind (1, 9) is (0, 9), which is occupied, meaning S0 must have advanced its tail as well if it grew to 10, OR the given body list for T27 reflects T26 state + growth and tail shedding logic that still leaves it at 10 cells.\nGiven H0=(1, 9) and B=[(0, 9), (0, 8), ..., (1, 2)], the cell behind H0=(1, 9) is (0, 9).\nS0 Potential moves from (1, 9):\n*   UP (1, 10): Off board $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   DOWN (1, 8): Hits own body segment (1, 2) if moving backward? No, the segment directly behind is (0, 9). (1, 8) is safe relative to its body map.\n*   LEFT (0, 9): Hits own body segment (0, 9) $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   RIGHT (2, 9): Safe position. Safe destination.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (1, 8) and (2, 9).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 moves vs S0 destinations)**\n\nWe need to check if any S1 move lands on a cell occupied by S0 *after* S0 moves, or if S0 moves onto a cell occupied by S1 *after* S1 moves.\n\nS1 Moves: D(2, 7), L(1, 8), R(3, 8)\nS0 Destinations: (1, 8), (2, 9)\n\n**Case 1: S1 DOWN (2, 7)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 8): No collision. (2, 7) != (1, 8) and (2, 7) is not in S0 body locations post-move. Safe.\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 9): Collision check: (2, 7) != (2, 9). Safe.\n\n$\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n**Case 2: S1 LEFT (1, 8)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 8): **HEAD-HEAD COLLISION!** (1, 8) = (1, 8). Both die. $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 9): No collision. (1, 8) != (2, 9). Safe.\n\nWe must assume the worst case where S0 chooses the move that kills us if possible. Since S0 can move to (1, 8) and collide with S1 moving to (1, 8), this path is dangerous if S0 prioritizes killing us. However, S0 might prioritize eating or self-preservation. Since S0 has no apples available by moving to (1, 8) or (2, 9), it must choose based on survival or positioning. Since both moves are survivable for S0, S1 must avoid (1, 8). $\\rightarrow$ **AVOID** L.\n\n**Case 3: S1 RIGHT (3, 8)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 8): No collision. (3, 8) != (1, 8). Safe.\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 9): No collision. (3, 8) != (2, 9). Safe.\n\n$\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Safe Moves: DOWN (2, 7) vs RIGHT (3, 8)**\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT keep the snake alive regardless of what S0 chooses (assuming S0 picks a safe move).\n\nWe look at proximity to apples.\nApples: (9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5).\nS1 is at (2, 8).\n\n*   Moving DOWN to (2, 7) moves us further away from the board center and top edge, perhaps setting up a path towards (5, 0), (5, 5), or (6, 3). It maintains connection to the left side (X=1, 2 columns) if we need to move left later.\n*   Moving RIGHT to (3, 8) moves us slightly further away from the center/bottom and closer to the right edge (X=9).\n\nS0 is currently highly concentrated in the top-left corner (X=0, 1). If S0 moves to (2, 9) (moving right parallel to the top border), it is consolidating position there. If S0 moves to (1, 8) (moving down), it is moving closer to the center vertically.\n\nSince S0 has 9 apples and we have 3, time pressure is low, but spatial positioning is key. Moving DOWN (2, 7) feels slightly better for creating a path towards the mid-board apples (6, 3), (5, 5), (8, 6) compared to drifting right towards the edge (3, 8). Our previous move (DOWN) was chosen to survive, and continuing on a path that seeks clear real estate seems prudent.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving downward/inward from the edge to secure clear paths toward the central apples, while keeping surveillance on S0's movements in the upper zone. (2, 7) maintains vertical progression away from the crowded top area.\n\nDOWN\n**Rationale Summary for T27:**\n1. Self moves analysis showed DOWN (2, 7), LEFT (1, 8), and RIGHT (3, 8) are safe from self-collision.\n2. Enemy snake S0, currently at (1, 9), can safely move to (1, 8) or (2, 9).\n3. Moving LEFT to (1, 8) risks a head-on collision if S0 chooses to move to (1, 8). This move is rejected.\n4. Both DOWN (2, 7) and RIGHT (3, 8) guarantee survival regardless of S0's safe choice.\n5. DOWN (2, 7) is chosen as it sets up a trajectory towards the denser cluster of available apples in the middle/bottom half of the board, moving away from the heavily populated top edge dominated by S0.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluation of Safe Moves: DOWN (2, 6) vs RIGHT (3, 7)**\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (2, 6) and RIGHT (3, 7).\n\nWe seek apples: (9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5). Our head is at (2, 7), just moved down from (2, 8). We are centralized vertically but far left horizontally.\n\n*   Moving DOWN to (2, 6): Continues the vertical progression downwards. This keeps us away from the top edge where S0 is heavily congested, and starts moving us toward the lower apples (5, 0).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (3, 7): Moves us horizontally toward the center, but maintains elevation towards the top where S0 is active.\n\nS0 is currently at (1, 8). If S0 moves to (2, 8) (RIGHT), it moves parallel to our previous path and starts expanding horizontally from the top-left corner. If S0 moves to (1, 7) (DOWN), it starts moving vertically down the left wall.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2, 6), we are safe from both possibilities for S0. We are maintaining a path towards the center apples (6, 3) and (5, 5). Given S0 has 9 apples and we only have 3, we need to secure safe paths toward the available fruit. Moving centrally and downwards feels like the best way to clear space from the top edge crowding.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving generally downwards and rightwards (towards larger X and smaller Y coordinates) to secure the available apples (6, 3), (5, 5), (8, 6), (9, 4) while maintaining a safe distance from the established heavy S0 presence in the top-left quadrant. DOWN (2, 6) supports this trajectory better than RIGHT (3, 7), which might invite closer interaction with S0's spread.\n\nDOWN\n---\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 27 / 150\n\nApples at: (9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5)\nSnake ID 1 Head: (2, 8).

S1 is now at (2, 7).\nThe previous choice (DOWN) led to a safe state where S0 also moved safely, resulting in S0 at (1, 8) and S1 at (2, 7).\n\nSafe Moves for T28: DOWN (2, 6), RIGHT (3, 7).\nDOWN maintains trajectory towards the bottom/center apples (5, 0), (6, 3).

Tail: (7, 9). (Note: The length increased by 1 from T28 because I successfully ate an apple on T28, which was implicit in the provided state description of T29: H=(2, 7) and B=[(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), ... (Aha! I need to check the T28 logic again. If I moved DOWN to (2, 6) in T28, I should have landed on an apple if one was at (2, 6). There was no apple at (2, 6) on T28. The provided state for T29 shows S1 length 8, meaning 3+5 apples. S0 has 9 apples. If the body list in T29 is accurate, I have grown. Let's trust the T29 provided state: H=(2, 7), B=[(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)]. This is only length 4, suggesting only 1 apple eaten in total? No, the problem states \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 3\". Since the game started with length 3, 3 apples means length $3+3=6$. The body list provided in the setup for T29 is: Head: (2, 6) $\\rightarrow$ WAIT, the setup for T29 states: Head: (2, 6), Body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)]. This is length 4.\nBut the *last move information* section refers to T28 where H=(2, 7) and the resulting move was DOWN.\n\n**Re-evaluating the State Based on Provided T29 Setup:**\nCurrent S1 State: H=(2, 6). Body: [(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)]. Length 4. Apples: 3. Tail: (2, 9).\nLast move was DOWN from (2, 7) to (2, 6). Since I had 3 apples before T28, length 6. If I moved DOWN to (2, 6) in T28, and there was no apple at (2, 6), my length should have decreased by 1 (due to non-eating move). Length 6 -> 5. Head (2, 7) -> (2, 6). Body should be [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)] (from previous state).\nIf length 4 is correct now, I must have lost segments somehow, or the body length tracking is inconsistent between turns, OR the T29 setup provided reflects the state *after* growing from T28 if (2, 6) *was* an apple.\n\nApples T28: (9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5). (2, 6) was NOT an apple.\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** I must use the current board state information provided for Turn 29 as the ground truth for my current position, regardless of the inconsistency in my tracking in the rationale for T28.\n\n**Current S1 State T29:** H=(2, 6). Body L=[(2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)]. Length 4. Tail: (2, 9).\n**Current S0 State T29:** H=(1, 7). Body L=[(1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)]. Length 10. Tail: (0, 3).\n\n**1. Analyze Self Moves (H1=(2, 6))**\nThe cell behind the head (previous head location) is (2, 7). The tail is (2, 9).\n\n*   UP (2, 7): Hits own body segment (2, 7) $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   DOWN (2, 5): Safe position.\n*   LEFT (1, 6): Safe position.\n*   RIGHT (3, 6): Safe position.\n\nSafe Moves for S1: DOWN ((2, 5)), LEFT ((1, 6)), RIGHT ((3, 6)).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(1, 7))**\nThe cell behind H0=(1, 7) is (1, 8).\nS0 Potential moves from (1, 7):\n*   UP (1, 8): Hits own body segment (1, 8) $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   DOWN (1, 6): Safe position relative to its body structure.\n*   LEFT (0, 7): Hits own body segment (0, 7) $\\rightarrow$ **DEAD**\n*   RIGHT (2, 7): Safe position.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (1, 6) and (2, 7).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 moves vs S0 destinations)**\n\nS1 Moves: D(2, 5), L(1, 6), R(3, 6)\nS0 Destinations: (1, 6), (2, 7)\n\n**Case 1: S1 DOWN (2, 5)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 6): No collision. Safe.\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 7): No collision. Safe.\n$\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n**Case 2: S1 LEFT (1, 6)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 6): **HEAD-HEAD COLLISION!** (1, 6) = (1, 6). Both die. $\\rightarrow$ **AVOID**\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 7): No collision. Safe.\n\n**Case 3: S1 RIGHT (3, 6)**\n*   If S0 moves to (1, 6): No collision. Safe.\n*   If S0 moves to (2, 7): No collision. Safe.\n$\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Safe Moves: DOWN (2, 5) vs RIGHT (3, 6)**\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (2, 5) and RIGHT (3, 6).\nCurrent Head is (2, 6). We are low on the board, having lost ground vertically in the transition from T28 to T29 based on the current setup state.\n\nApples: (9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5).\n\n*   Moving DOWN to (2, 5): Continues moving towards the bottom apple (5, 0) and (6, 3) without rushing into S0 conflict zones or promising apples immediately. It keeps us away from S0's current depth (H0=1, 7).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (3, 6): Moves us toward the center (5, 5) and closer to the apple at (8, 6).\n\nS0 is currently at (1, 7).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (1, 6), it gets closer to the bottom left corner.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (2, 7), it gains horizontal progress toward our location.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 6): We are 2 units away from S0 if S0 moves right to (2, 7). This seems aggressive.\nIf we move DOWN to (2, 5): We create maximal separation from S0's current location (1, 7) and potential moves (1, 6) or (2, 7). This maximizes safety immediately.\n\nGiven S0's established vertical dominance near the left edge, prioritizing separation downwards seems prudent before attempting to cut across the map towards the apples at Y=4/5/6. Following the vertical path downward preserves options and safety margin.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving generally downward (small Y values) until we reach the bottom edge (Y=0) or gain a commanding position relative to S0 that allows us to safely traverse horizontally towards high-value apples (8, 6) or (9, 4).\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN",

Given S0 is entrenched vertically on the left side, maintaining distance and heading toward the lower quadrant seems strategically sound for the immediate future, especially since we are quite short (length 4).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 6):** Moves us horizontally towards the apple at (8, 6) and (5, 5). If S0 moves right to (2, 7), we are then adjacent to S0, which might lead to traps on the next turn if S0 decides to press right or corner us.\n\nThe previous move rationale prioritized safety and distance from S0 after the perceived state inconsistency. Continuing DOWN creates maximum separation from S0's current column (X=1) and prepares to sweep across the lower half of the board where S0 seems less focused (S0 has a massive tail blocking the left edge Y=0 to Y=9).\n\nI will stick to the safety-first approach and continue downward trajectory toward the lower apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize surviving S0's flanking maneuvers by maintaining separation in the Y direction where possible until S1 can safely cross lanes or S0 moves into a risky position. Aim for apples (6, 3) or (5, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Evaluation of Safe Moves: DOWN (2, 3) vs RIGHT (3, 4)**\n\nBoth DOWN (2, 3) and RIGHT (3, 4) are safe moves against any immediate S0 reaction. Snake 0 is heavily invested on the left side (X=0, X=1).\n\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Moves us further away from S0 and closer to the large cluster of apples in the lower left quadrant, specifically (5, 0) and (6, 3). This also maximizes distance from S0's head (1, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Moves us toward apples (5, 5), (6, 3), and (9, 4). However, S0's body is somewhat blocking movement further right/up, and moving further away from the bulk of S0 seems safer given S0 is so long.\n\nThe move DOWN aligns with the previous rationale of moving away from the dense enemy block on the left edge and heading towards the lower apples. It maintains a good horizontal separation (X=2 vs X=1 for S0) while actively moving away from S0's current Y position (Y=5). If S0 moves to (2, 5) next turn, we are at (2, 3), still maintaining breathing room.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving downwards/towards the lower half of the board to avoid getting boxed in by the enemy snake dominating the left edge (X=0 and X=1). Target apples (5, 0) and (6, 3) next. Keep an eye on apple (5, 5) for later.\n\nDOWN",

However, moving right pushes us slightly closer to the concentration area that S0 occupies at X=0, 1, potentially reducing options later if S0 decides to expand horizontally.\n\nGiven S0 currently has its head at (1, 4), moving DOWN to (2, 2) creates maximum separation (1 cell horizontal gap, 2 cells vertical gap if S0 moves to (1, 3)). If S0 moves right to (2, 4), we are at (2, 2), still far away. DOWN seems slightly better for maintaining positional separation from the immediate threat area on the left.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving generally towards the lower half of the board (Y=0 to Y=4) to collect apples (5, 0) and (6, 3), while maintaining distance from Snake #0 which is locked down the left edge.\n\nDOWN",

It sets up to move towards apple (5, 0) next turn, potentially via (3, 1) or (4, 1) then (4, 0). If S0 plays aggressively to (2, 3), we are at (2, 1), maintaining a 2-cell gap.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 2):** Moves towards the center and apples (6, 3) and (5, 5). If S0 plays defensively to (1, 2), we move to (3, 2) creating a 2-cell gap too. If S0 plays to (2, 3), we are at (3, 2), still relatively separated.\n\nThe apple at (6, 3) seems slightly more accessible and valuable right now than the one at (5, 0), as it requires fewer moves to reach its general vicinity (right/up compared to down/right). Moving RIGHT positions us better relative to the center of the board.\n\nLet's check the follow-up if we move RIGHT to (3, 2).\nNext turn S1=(3, 2). Safe S1 moves are (3, 1), (4, 2), (3, 3).\nS0 will likely move to (1, 2) or (2, 3) to maintain pressure or defend.\nIf S0 moves to (1, 2) (down), S1 can move to (4, 2) targeting (6, 3).\nIf S0 moves to (2, 3) (right), S1 can move to (3, 3) which is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems slightly more favorable for capturing the nearby apples.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving generally rightwards/upwards towards the clustered apples at (6, 3) and (5, 5), while maintaining adequate separation from Snake #0, which is primarily on the left vertical track.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, I need to re-read the last move.\n 2 . 0 T 1 . . . . . .  <- This board state reflects the state AFTER S1 moved RIGHT to (3, 2) last turn.\n\nLet's verify the previous state and move:\nLast Turn (T33) State: H1=(2, 2), Body=[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)].\nLast Move Pick: RIGHT.\nNew Head location: (2+1, 2) = (3, 2).\nNew Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. (Tail (2, 6) should have been dropped if no apple was found, but the board representation seems slightly inconsistent with standard growth if the body list shows 4 segments for a score of 3. Let's re-examine the board state provided for T34.)\n\nBoard T34 state:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 2), Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. Apples: 3.\nThis means S1 lost one segment from its tail compared to the T33 body list [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]. Since no apple was eaten, the tail must have shrunk by 1, matching the current body list length of 3 (Head + 3 body segments = 4 total length if it had eaten 3 apples). Since it has 3 apples, its total length should be 3 (head) + 3 (body) = 4.\n\nIf S1 collected 3 apples, length = 3 + 3 = 6 segments total.\nThe listed body length is 3 segments: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. Total length = 4. This implies S1 collected 1 apple total (Length = 1 + Score).\nScore 3 -> Length 4. This confirms the provided snake body list implies a length of 4 segments total (1 head + 3 body). This must mean the score of 3 is how many apples were *eaten*, and the current length reflects the eating history dynamically. A snake starting at length 1 collects 3 apples, so its length should be $1+3=4$.\nHead (3, 2) + Body [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)] confirms length 4. This is consistent.\n\nEnemy S0: Head: (1, 2), Body: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]. Length 10. Score must be 9, which matches.\n\n---\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 34)**\nH1 = (3, 2). Body = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)].\nH0 = (1, 2). Body = [(1, 3), ..., (0, 8)].\n\nApples: A = {(9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5)}\n\n**1. Analyze Self Moves (H1=(3, 2))**\nBoard limits 0-9. Backward move is LEFT to (2, 2).\n*   UP (3, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (3, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (2, 2): Hits own body segment (2, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (4, 2): Safe.\nSafe S1 Destinations: (3, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(1, 2))**\nBackward move for S0 is RIGHT to (2, 2).\n*   UP (1, 3): Hits own body segment (1, 3). **DEAD**.\n*   DOWN (1, 1): Safe relative to S0 body.\n*   LEFT (0, 2): Safe relative to S0 body.\n*   RIGHT (2, 2): Safe relative to S0 body.\nSafe S0 Destinations: (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 2).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 move vs S0 destination)**\n\nS1 Moves: U(3, 3), D(3, 1), R(4, 2)\nS0 Destinations: (1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 2)\n\n*   **S1 UP (3, 3):**\n    *   S0 to (1, 1): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (0, 2): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (2, 2): Safe.\n    $\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n*   **S1 DOWN (3, 1):**\n    *   S0 to (1, 1): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (0, 2): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (2, 2): Safe.\n    $\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\n*   **S1 RIGHT (4, 2):**\n    *   S0 to (1, 1): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (0, 2): Safe.\n    *   S0 to (2, 2): Safe.\n    $\\rightarrow$ **SAFE** Move.\n\nAll three surviving moves for S1 are safe against all predictable safe moves for S0 this turn, as the heads are quite separated (X=3 vs X=1, Y=2 for both).\n\n**4. Evaluation of Safe Moves: (3, 3) vs (3, 1) vs (4, 2)**\nWe just moved RIGHT last turn to get to (3, 2). Continuing rightwards (4, 2) seems like a good overall direction given the apple distribution and S0's concentration on the left edge.\n\n*   **RIGHT (4, 2):** Moves directly towards the apples at (5, 5) and (6, 3). This seems like the intended continuation of the strategy from T33.\n    *   If S0 moves to (2, 2) (its backward move), we are at (4, 2) vs (2, 2). Still safe.\n    *   If S0 moves to (1, 1) (down), we keep approaching the center/right.\n\n*   **UP (3, 3):** Moves towards the center vertical line (X=3). A bit centralizing. Next move could be (4, 3) or (3, 4).\n*   **DOWN (3, 1):** Moves towards the bottom edge. Less useful for reaching the primary apple clusters which are mostly in the middle/top right quadrant relative to our current position.\n\nComparing RIGHT (4, 2) to UP (3, 3): (4, 2) gains horizontal distance towards the dense cluster of apples (5, 5) and (6, 3), and it maintains separation from S0 who is currently positioned on the left side (X=0, X=1).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue moving generally rightwards towards the cluster of apples (6, 3) and (5, 5). Since S0 is currently occupying the left column heavily, maintaining distance to the right seems safest and most productive.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Goal apples are at (5, 5), (6, 3), (8, 6), (9, 4).\nS0 is trapped on the left side, currently heading slightly down/left, but its options are very limited by its own long body. It is likely to try to move RIGHT to (2, 1) or DOWN to (1, 0) to expand area.\n\n*   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Moves directly towards (5, 5) and (6, 3). This continues the previous strategy of moving towards the right/middle cluster. Next move could be (6, 2) or (5, 3). This seems optimal for apple acquisition.\n*   **UP (4, 3):** Moves towards the center. If S0 moves to (2, 1), we are still far apart. Next move could be (5, 3) or (4, 4). This keeps options open both vertically and horizontally.\n*   **DOWN (4, 1):** Moves towards the bottom edge, near apple (5, 0). This is less efficient since (5, 0) is isolated and we are currently better positioned to reach the main cluster.\n\n(5, 2) seems slightly better than (4, 3) as it gains distance towards the most promising apples (5, 5) in the immediate area, and maintains good separation from S0.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving generally towards the apple cluster located around X=5 to X=8. Since S0 is pinned on the left, maximizing our distance to the right remains the safest and most productive path for the next few turns, aiming for (5, 5) or (6, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

If an apple was not eaten, the tail should have moved. The board state shows S1 length 4: H:(5,2), B:[(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)]. The provided body list [(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)] seems to match the state *before* the tail drop resulting from moving RIGHT from (4, 2) if no apple was eaten. Let's re-verify the board state vs the rationale provided for Turn 35, which resulted in the current Turn 36 state.)\n\n**Reconciling State for Turn 36:**\nLast Rationale (Turn 35) ended with the decision to move RIGHT from (4, 2) to (5, 2).\nIf the move RIGHT happened:\nH_new = (5, 2). Since no apple was eaten, the tail segment of the previous state is dropped.\nPrevious State H=(4, 2), B=[(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. The cell dropped was (2, 3).\nNew State should be: H=(5, 2), B=[(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n\nBoard State given for Turn 36:\nH: (5, 2)\nBody: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]\nApples: 3 (Score 3)\nThis board state implies that the move from Turn 35 *was not* RIGHT to (5, 2) AND that the snake did not grow. Given the board visually matches the snake body, I must assume the provided Board State snapshot for Turn 36 is accurate, regardless of the conflict derived from the previous rationale's final move description (\"RIGHT\").\n\nIf H=(5, 2) and B=[(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)], the length is 5, and the score must also be 4 (since length = starting length 1 + apples).\nSince the reported apples are 3, the current length should be $1 + 3 = 4$.\nThe provided body list has 4 segments: (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3). If the head is (5, 2), the length is $1+4=5$.\nIf Score = 3, Length must be 4. The body list must have 3 elements, e.g., [(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)].\n\nLet's rely strictly on the Head/Body/Score listed for Turn 36:\nH: (5, 2). B: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. Score: 3.\nThis implies the snake length is $1 + 3 = 4$. This means the body list provided must contain only 3 elements IF the score is 3.\nSince the body list has 4 elements, if the score is 3, this is contradictory unless the starting length was implicitly 2, which is unlikely.\n\n**Assumption based on Board Visual and Score:** The snake is 4 segments long (Score 3). The board visual shows the head at (5, 2) and 3 subsequent segments: (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2). The segment (2, 3) shown in the text body list appears to be a remnant error or visualization artifact, as the board map shows:\n(5, 2) H1\n(4, 2) T1\n(3, 2) T2\n(2, 2) T3 (Tail)\nThe segment (2, 3) is at Y=3, Snake 0 is near Y=1-9. Let's trust the visual map coordinates for the body segments: (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2). Length 4, Score 3.\n\n**Current State for Turn 36 (Adjusted based on visual confirmation/Score consistency):**\nHead: (5, 2)\nBody segments occupied: (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2). (Tail is (2, 2)).\nScore: 3.\n\nEnemy Head (S0): (2, 1). Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9)]. Length 10, Score 9.\n\nApples: A = {(9, 4), (8, 6), (6, 3), (5, 0), (5, 5)}.\n\n**1. Analyze Self Moves (H1=(5, 2))**\nSelf body cells: (5, 2) Head, (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2) Body.\nBackward move is LEFT to (4, 2) -> Hits own body (4, 2). **DEAD**.\n\n*   UP (5, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 2): Hits own body (4, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Safe.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (5, 3), (5, 1), (6, 2).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(2, 1))**\nS0 Body segments: (2, 1) Head, (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (0, 9). Tail is (0, 9).\nBackward move is UP to (2, 2) -> Hits potential future position OR body? (2, 2) is S1's current tail segment.\n\n*   UP (2, 2): Hitting S1's body segment (2, 2). **S0 DIES if it moves UP**.\n*   DOWN (2, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 1): Hits own body (1, 1). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (3, 1): Safe.\n\nSafe S0 Destinations: (2, 0), (3, 1).\nPotential Death Move for S0: UP (2, 2).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 move vs Safe S0 destination)**\nS1 Moves: U(5, 3), D(5, 1), R(6, 2)\nS0 Safe Dest: (2, 0), (3, 1)\nS0 Risky Dest: (2, 2)\n\nSince S1 is far to the right (X=5/6) and S0 is far to the left (X=2/3), self-interaction is safe for all S1 moves against S0's safe moves.\n\n**4. Collision Check vs S0 Risky Move (2, 2)**\nIf S0 moves UP to (2, 2), it collides with S1's body segment (2, 2). S0 dies. S1 lives.\nS1 Moves checking collision with (2, 2):\n*   (5, 3): Safe.\n*   (5, 1): Safe.\n*   (6, 2): Safe.\n\n**5. Evaluation of Safe Moves**\nWe want apples: (5, 5), (6, 3), (8, 6), (9, 4), (5, 0).\nCurrent position (5, 2).\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Moves towards (6, 3) and (5, 5). This is the most direct path towards the nearest apples (6, 3) and (5, 5) in the center/upper area. Following up: (7, 2) or (6, 3) (if apple is still there).\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Moves towards (5, 5). Next move could be (5, 4) or (6, 3). Also excellent.\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** Moves towards (5, 0). (5, 0) is isolated, and moving away from the main cluster at X=5/6/8/9 might be slightly slower overall than prioritizing the central group.\n\nComparing (6, 2) and (5, 3):\n(6, 2) immediately gains distance towards the X coordinate of (6, 3) and (9, 4).\n(5, 3) gains vertical separation while remaining in the X=5 line for potential apple (5, 5).\n\nSince (6, 3) is a prime target, moving towards X=6 seems marginally better than staying on X=5 for one more turn, especially since moving to (6, 2) opens up a diagonal approach to (6, 3) next turn if S0 moves to (2, 0).\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving towards the apple cluster on the right side (X=5 to X=9). Since S0 is severely constrained and likely to either crash or retreat towards the low-X edge, maximizing our aggressive pursuit of the remaining apples is key. RIGHT (6, 2) looks best positioned to reach (6, 3) or (5, 5) quickly.\n\nRIGHT\n***\nLong Term Plan Note: Prioritize reaching apples (6, 3) and (5, 5). Snake 0 is pinned on the left side and appears unable to threaten us unless we move far left. Continue moving right/upwards.\n***\nRIGHT",

Tail drops from (2, 2).\nNew State should be: H=(6, 2), B=[(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. Length 4. Score 3.\nThis matches the state provided for Turn 37 exactly!\n\nTarget apples are (6, 3) and (5, 5).\nH1 = (6, 2).\nBackward move is LEFT to (5, 2) -> Hits own body (5, 2). **DEAD**.\n\n*   UP (6, 3): **EATS APPLE (6, 3)**. Grows!\n*   DOWN (6, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (5, 2): Hits own body (5, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (7, 2): Safe.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (6, 3) [Apple], (6, 1), (7, 2).\n\n**6. Analyze Enemy Moves (H0=(3, 1))**\nS0 Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 8)]. Tail is (1, 8) if it didn't move last turn and didn't eat. Last turn (36 to 37), S0 went from (2, 1) to (3, 1) if it moved RIGHT to align with the final board state (assuming it survived).\nWe must infer S0's body based on the board state provided for Turn 37.\nS0 Head is (3, 1). Following the body segments provided: (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)... (1, 8). This confirms S0 moved RIGHT from (2, 1) to (3, 1) last turn, and did not eat, dropping its tail (which was previously (1, 9) based on the previous turn's body structure of length 10 for score 9).\nS0 Tail is (1, 8). (Body length 9 based on listed segments, score 9 implies length 10. Let's trust the listed body elements + head = 10 segments total). Tail is the last element shown: (1, 8).\n\nS0 Head H0=(3, 1). Body cells occupied: (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8).\n\nPossible S0 Moves from (3, 1):\n*   UP (3, 2): Safe. (S1 body segments are elsewhere).\n*   DOWN (3, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (2, 1): Hits own body (2, 1). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (4, 1): Safe.\n\nSafe S0 Destinations: (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1).\n\n**7. Check Collisions (S1 move vs S0 Destinations)**\nS1 Desired Move: UP (6, 3) - Eats Apple.\nS0 Safe against S1: (3, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1).\n\nNo direct intersection between S1 destinations and S0 destinations.\n\n**8. Collision Check vs S0 Body**\nIf S1 moves to (6, 3):\nS0 Body: (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8). (6, 3) is safe from S0 body.\n\n**9. Collision Check vs S1 Body Growth**\nIf S1 moves UP to (6, 3), it eats the apple and grows. Its new tail will replace (6, 2).\nNew S1 Body: (6, 3) H, (6, 2) B1, (5, 2) B2, (4, 2) B3. (Tail is (4, 2)).\n\nWe must check the path of S0 UP (3, 2).\nIf S0 moves UP to (3, 2), this cell is currently empty. It will not hit our *new* body at (6, 2) or (5, 2) or (4, 2).\n\nThis move (UP) immediately secures the apple at (6, 3) and increases our score to 4. It also maintains a safe position relative to S0, which is still far away. This is the clear best move.\n\nLong Term Plan Note: Goal is to eat (5, 5) next, or continue sweeping towards (8, 6) and (9, 4). S0 is currently trapped on the low-X positions. Maintain separation and focus on apples.\n***\nUP",

Collision Check vs S0 Risky Move (4, 2)**\nIf S0 moves UP to (4, 2), it collides with S1's body segment (4, 2). S0 dies. S1 lives.\nS1 Moves checking collision with (4, 2): Safe, as all S1 destinations are X=5, 6, or 7, and Y=3 or 4.\n\n**5. Evaluation of Safe Moves**\nWe are aiming for (5, 5), (8, 6), or (9, 4). We just moved toward the center area. S0 is currently trailing on X=4, Y=1.\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 3):** Moves one step closer to (5, 5). Safe from S0's known potential moves.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 3):** Moves away from immediate apples, but gets closer to the top right apples (8, 6), (9, 4).\n*   **UP (6, 4):** Moves towards (8, 6)/(9, 4). Safe.\n\nS0 presents a strong threat because if it moves UP (4, 2), it dies, and if it moves RIGHT (5, 1), it approaches the center. We should try to maintain separation or leverage our lead in body segments to scare it into hitting our body.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (5, 3):\nS0 might move RIGHT to (5, 1). Now S1 is at (5, 3) and S0 is at (5, 1). Separation maintained.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (4, 0). Separation maintained.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (6, 4):\nS0 might move RIGHT to (5, 1). Separation maintained.\n\nThe next closest apple is (5, 5). Moving to (5, 3) puts us 2 steps away horizontally and 2 steps away vertically from that apple. Moving to (7, 3) keeps us further away from (5, 5).\n\nLet's try LEFT towards (5, 5).\n\nLong Term Plan: Secure apple (5, 5) next, then assess the path towards (8, 6) and (9, 4). Avoid getting boxed between S0 and the bottom wall (Y=0). Since S0 is currently confined to small X values (1-4), moving slightly towards the center/right while closing distance to (5, 5) seems optimal. Movement LEFT to (5, 3) is 2 away from (5, 5).\n\nWait, (5, 5) is accessible via (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) OR (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5).\n\nIf move LEFT to (5, 3):\nNext turn options from (5, 3) looking at (5, 5):\n*   UP (5, 4) -> next turn EAT (5, 5) if safe.\n\nIf move UP to (6, 4):\nNext turn options from (6, 4) looking at (5, 5):\n*   LEFT (5, 4) -> next turn EAT (5, 5) if safe.\n\nBoth paths take 2 moves to reach (5, 5). Moving LEFT to (5, 3) is slightly more central to other apples ((8, 6), (9, 4) are far, (5, 0) is back down). Given the immediate proximity of (5, 5), LEFT seems slightly better positioned for the next step.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's assume the body list given in the current input is accurate for defining immediate self-collision proximity, and the tail is (4, 2)).\nPrevious state (Turn 38 End): Head at (6, 3). Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. Length 5, Score 4.\nIf the move was LEFT to (5, 3), the new body should be: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)]. The provided body is: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)]. This confirms the head is (5, 3) and the tail (4, 2) has *not* been retained, meaning the move to (5, 3) *did not* eat an apple.\n\nGiven Head (5, 3) and Body [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)], the cell behind the head is (6, 3).\n\nRecalculating safe moves based on Head (5, 3) and Body segments (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2):\n*   **UP (5, 4):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN (5, 2):** Hits body (5, 2). **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT (4, 3):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 3):** Hits body (6, 3). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (5, 4), (4, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Moves from (5, 1)**\nEnemy S0 Head: (5, 1). Body ends at (1, 6).\nPossible S0 Moves from (5, 1):\n*   UP (5, 2): Safe (S1 body at (5, 2) is not there--it's tail position if an apple wasn't eaten last turn, but currently body is (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)). **(5, 2) IS occupied by S1 body.** If S0 moves to (5, 2), S0 DIES by hitting S1 body.\n*   DOWN (5, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 1): Hits own body (4, 1). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 1): Safe.\n\nSafe S0 Destinations: (5, 0), (6, 1).\nPotential Death Move for S0: UP (5, 2).\n\n**3. Check Collisions (S1 move vs Safe S0 destination)**\nS1 Moves: U(5, 4), L(4, 3)\nS0 Safe Dest: (5, 0), (6, 1)\nNo intersections.\n\n**4. Collision Check vs S0 Risky Move (5, 2)**\nIf S0 moves UP to (5, 2), it collides with S1's body segment (5, 2). S0 dies.\n\n**5. Strategy Formulation**\nWe are targeting apple (5, 5) next, as it is the closest non-eaten apple (2 moves away diagonally if we move towards it).\nS1 Head (5, 3). Target (5, 5).\n\n*   **Move UP (5, 4):** Reaches (5, 4) -> Next turn can move to (5, 5) or (4, 4) or (6, 4). Moving to (5, 5) on the next turn eats the apple, assuming S0 doesn't block us or die first.\n*   **Move LEFT (4, 3):** Moves away from (5, 5).\n\nUP (5, 4) is the clear best path towards the nearest apple (5, 5).\n\n**Analyzing S0 reaction to S1 moving UP (5, 4):**\nS0 is at (5, 1).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (5, 0) (eats apple): S0 head is at (5, 0). Safe separation from S1 at (5, 4).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (6, 1): Safe separation from S1 at (5, 4).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (5, 4), S1 is 1 turn away from eating (5, 5). This is the optimal path.\n\nLong Term Plan: Move UP to (5, 4) to set up for eating apple (5, 5) on Turn 40. Monitor S0's proximity and movements, particularly if it gets boxed in by our body or the wall.\n\nMove UP.\nUP",

This is clearly the best move as it satisfies offense immediately without self-collision or immediate external collision risk. S0 is moving to the bottom edge where there is one apple (8, 0) left, but S0 is already significantly ahead (10 vs 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Eat apple (5, 5) immediately via move UP. On subsequent turns, aim for (8, 6) or (7, 6) after ensuring S0 doesn't become immediately threatening by trapping or cornering us. Since S0 is moving along the bottom/left, we have space in the center/top.\n\nMove UP ensures we gain length now, making future navigation slightly easier and increasing our score lead against all *other* potential future opponents (if any existed, though only S0 is shown).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This seems to be the direction that commits us toward the highest value remaining targets.\nMoving LEFT to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 5) keeps us more centralized but slightly further from the cluster.\n\nGiven the large gap in scores (10 vs 5), speed matters, but survival is paramount. Moving UP gets us closer to the high ground where S0 is unlikely to follow immediately, as S0 is still committed near the bottom of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move UP to (5, 6). This sets up a path towards the top edge (e.g., (5, 7) next turn) to reach the valuable corner apples (8, 6) and (7, 6). We must watch S0's path carefully, as it has many more potential moves than us in the open space.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Tail is (1, 6).\n*Note: Enemy 0's last move rationale indicated they moved from (7, 0) to (5, 0) somehow, but the board state/body list shows the enemy moved to (5, 0) and their body shifted, consuming an apple at (5, 0) in the previous turn, leading to the head at (5, 0) and body starting at (4, 0) on the current board look (which is Turn 42). Let's re-examine the board state provided:*\n\nBoard State Re-check for Turn 42:\nSnake 1 (Me, ID 1): Head (5, 6). Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Score 5.\n*Wait, my last move rationale indicated I ate an apple at (5, 5) on Turn 41. If I moved UP from (5, 5) to (5, 6) and ate nothing, my head would be (5, 6) and body would shift, the tail would be removed if I didn't eat.*\n*Let's trust the provided Board State over my self-correction if they conflict, as the provided board state dictates the current reality.*\n\n**Current Reality Check (Turn 42):**\nMy Head: (5, 6)\nMy Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2)] (Length 5, Score 5)\n*If the length is 5, it implies I did NOT eat last turn, or the tail was effectively removed in a way that didn't result in growth.*\n*If my head was (5, 5) last turn (T41 start), and I chose UP, my new head is (5, 6). Since my score is 5, my length should be 6 if the tail didn't drop, but the body list only shows 5 segments plus the head, totaling 6 body segments (Head + 5 Body = Length 6). Let's assume the provided body list *includes* the segments sequentially after the head.*\nMy Snake Length = 1 (Head) + 5 (Body list) = 6 segments. Score 5 means 5 apples eaten, length should be 1 + 5 = 6, provided the tail didn't drop due to missing an apple on T41. Since my score is 5, I must have grown on the 5th apple. On T41 I moved from (5, 5) to (5, 6). If (5, 5) was an apple, I should have grown. If I grew, my tail should have stayed put, increasing length to 7. Since the body list length is 5 (total 6 pieces), I did *not* eat on T41. The listed body [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2)] confirms this standard shifting behavior unless (5, 5) was the apple I thought I ate in the previous *rationale*.\n\n*Crucially, the board state provided for T42 must be the basis:*\nMy Head: (5, 6). Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Tail: (6, 2). Length 6. Score 5.\nEnemy 0 Head: (7, 0). Body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. Tail: (1, 4). Length 10. Score 10.\n*Note: The enemy state differs significantly from the preceding rationale's prediction. I must base my move on the CURRENT board state.*\n\n**1. Evaluate Self Moves from (5, 6)**\nForbidden self-collision targets: The cell the tail comes from, (5, 5), and all other body parts: (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2).\n*   **UP (5, 7):** Safe. (No apple here)\n*   **DOWN (5, 5):** Hits own body. **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT (4, 6):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 6):** Safe.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (5, 7), (4, 6), (6, 6).\n\n**2.

Its previous head was adjacent to (7, 0). Based on the body list, it looks like it moved RIGHT from (6, 0) to (7, 0) and ate the apple at (8, 0) previously, yet the apple (8, 0) is still listed. This confirms the board state overrides assumptions from previous turns. If S0 was at (6, 0) and moved RIGHT to (7, 0), the cell (7, 0) must have been empty/an apple.\nThe apple (8, 0) is still present. If S0 ate (8, 0) on T41, its length should be 11. Since length is 10, S0 did not eat on T41. S0 moved from (6, 0) or (7, -1) or (8, 0) or (7, 1).

Strategy Planning**\nApples remaining: A = {(9, 4), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 1)}. (Note: (8, 0) is now a target for S0).\nMy head is at (5, 6). The cluster of high-value apples is (8, 6) and (7, 6). S0 is at (7, 0) and is very likely to go for (8, 0).\n\n*   Moving **UP (5, 7)** positions me perfectly to continue climbing towards the (8, 6)/(7, 6) cluster. This keeps me moving away from or parallel to S0's likely path along the bottom/middle right.\n*   Moving **LEFT (4, 6)** moves me towards the center-left, away from the main targets.\n*   Moving **RIGHT (6, 6)** moves me adjacent to the main targets, but slightly slower than moving directly up to (5, 7) then (5, 8) or (6, 7).\n\nThe UP move (to 5, 7) maintains the highest rate of progress toward the highest density of remaining apples, all of which are in the upper half of the board. Since S0 is currently clearing the bottom, climbing is the best option.\n\nShort-Term Plan: Continue moving UPward toward (8, 6) and (7, 6). Watch S0 path carefully; if S0 tries to move horizontally across the upper half, adjust course.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Since S0 is currently far away and moving somewhat horizontally/downward based on potential moves, staying vertical seems optimal for resource acquisition.\n\n**Long Term Plan (Next few turns):** Focus on reaching the (8, 6)/(7, 6) cluster by continuing UP. If S0 starts moving significantly towards the top half, adjust to intercept or move to (9, 4) or (6, 1)/(0, 6) if necessary.\n\nUP",

Length 12, Tail (1, 5). Score 11. (S0 grew because it likely moved to an empty spot, but its score is 11, suggesting I failed to account for a previous eat or the initial state was tricky. For now, I use the provided score: S0 ate 11 apples, thus its length should be 12 if it ate last turn. If S0 moved from (8, 0) to (8, 1) and didn't eat, its length is 11 + 1 tail segment loss = 11. If it moved to (8, 1) and *did* eat an apple, its length would be 13. Since the board shows S0 at (8, 1) and its body list in the T43 setup suggested length 11 (10 body + 1 head), I must recalculate S0's move based on the board state provided for T44.)\n\n**Revisiting S0's move calculation BEFORE my move THIS turn (T44):**\nS0 at T43 Start: Head (8, 0), Body length 11 positions (Score 11). Tail was (1, 4).\nSafe moves for S0 from (8, 0) were (8, 1) or (9, 0).\nIf S0 moved to (8, 1) and *did not* eat: New body is [(7, 0), (6, 0), ..., (1, 4), (8, 0)]. Tail (1, 4) is removed, (8, 0) becomes new tail site. Length remains 11.\nIf S0 moved to (9, 0) and *did not* eat: New body is [(7, 0), (6, 0), ..., (1, 4), (8, 0)]. Tail (1, 4) removed. Length 11.\n\nThe current board state shows S0 head at (8, 1). This matches one of S0's likely safe moves. Since S0's score remains 11, it implies it did not eat this past turn.\nS0 Body T44 Start: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. (Length 11). Tail (1, 4) moves next, (8, 0) is now occupied by the segment formerly at (8, 1) if it was the tail, but S0's move was UP.\nIf S0 moved UP: The body list provided in T43 was: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)].

S0 is currently relatively high up.\nS0 likely wants to move UP towards (8, 2) or RIGHT towards (9, 1). It could also move DOWN towards (8, 0) if it feels safe.\n\nPotential S0 moves (T0):\n1.  **UP (8, 2):** Safe move, moves towards high apples.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 0):** Safe move, stays low.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 1):** Safe move, moves towards center.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 1):** Safe move, moves towards edge.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Check Collisions (S1 move vs T0)**\n\nS1 Body Collision Check: (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3).\n\n*   **S1 moves UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   T0 checks: (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 1). None overlap (5, 9).\n    *   **Collision Safety:** Appears safe from self-collision and S0 head collision.\n\n*   **S1 moves LEFT to (4, 8):**\n    *   T0 checks: (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 1). None overlap (4, 8).\n    *   **Collision Safety:** Appears safe.\n\n*   **S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   T0 checks: (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1), (9, 1). None overlap (6, 8).\n    *   **Collision Safety:** Appears safe.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Strategy & Apple Acquisition**\n\nI am at (5, 8). The nearest apples are (8, 6) and (7, 6). I am 3 or 2 steps away horizontally, and 2 steps away vertically, if I move optimally.\n\nPrevious move was UP to (5, 8).\nMove options:\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** Continues straight up, getting nearer the top boundary, but maintaining a path towards (8, 6)/(7, 6) in 2-3 more turns (e.g., R, R, D, D). This keeps options open.\n2.  **RIGHT (6, 8):** Immediately starts moving East toward the cluster. Next move could be (7, 8), then (8, 8), bringing me very close to (8, 6).\n3.  **LEFT (4, 8):** Moves away from the action.\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT:\nIf UP (5, 9): Next move likely RIGHT to (6, 9) or (6, 8) if (5, 9) feels too high.\nIf RIGHT (6, 8): Next move likely UP (6, 9) or RIGHT (7, 8).\n\nSince S0 is currently at (8, 1), it is far below the primary targets (8, 6) and (7, 6). I have a clear path there. Moving RIGHT (6, 8) is more aggressive towards the target cluster now that I am established at the Y=8 level.\n\nLet's see the path complexity:\nPath 1 (UP): (5, 8) -> (5, 9) -> (6, 9) [or (7, 9)] -> ...\nPath 2 (RIGHT): (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) [1 step closer to the target column X=8].\n\nPath 2 seems slightly more direct pathing towards the X coordinates of the desirable apples (X=7, X=8).\n\n**Long term plan:** Continue moving towards the (8, 6) / (7, 6) apple cluster by prioritizing RIGHT/UP movements until a target is reached or S0 moves aggressively towards them.\n\n**Prediction for next move by S0 (If S1 chooses RIGHT (6, 8)):** S0 will likely continue UP to (8, 2) or (8, 3) or move towards (9, 1). All seem safe relative to (6, 8).\n\nChoosing RIGHT to close the distance horizontally to the high-value apples.\n\nRIGHT",

(If my T43 body list ending at (6, 3) was correct, the T44 body should be [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]. The provided prompt body list for T45 Start seems to be missing the tail segment and/or reflecting a 1-segment shorter body than expected based on the T43 description, but I must use the state as presented for T45 Start for collision checking: **Head: (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4)]**. Length = 6 total segments. Tail is (5, 4)).\n\nForbidden Self-Targets (S1): (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4).\n\n**S0 Head: (7, 1)** (From move LEFT last turn, assuming S0 moved LEFT from (8, 1) to (7, 1) to avoid the main apple cluster area for a turn, though my assumption in the last rationale was RIGHT/UP).\n*Re-checking S0 move assumption.* In the previous rationale, I predicted S0 moves to (8, 2), (8, 0), (7, 1), or (9, 1). The board shows S0 Head at (7, 1). This implies S0 chose LEFT from (8, 1). I must proceed with (7, 1) as S0 Head.\n\n**S0 Body (S0):** [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]. (Length 11 body + 1 head = 12 segments total). Tail (1, 5).\nForbidden S0 Targets (S0): (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4). (Note: (8, 0) is now empty).\n\n**Apples A:** (9, 4), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 1), (0, 6).\n\n---\n**Step 1 & 2: Determine Safe Moves for S1 from (6, 8)**\n\n*   **UP (6, 9):** Safe from self.\n*   **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe from self.\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** Hits own body (5, 8). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe from self.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (6, 9), (6, 7), (7, 8).\n\n---\n**Step 3: Predict S0 Moves from (7, 1)**\nS0 is currently low down. It might move UP towards the center (7, 2) or try to get to the far side (9, 1) or even (9, 0). Given its low score relative to me (11 vs 5, but it's much longer), survival might still be key, but apples are near Y=6. Moving directly towards the apples seems reasonable if safe.\n\nPotential S0 moves (T0) from (7, 1):\n1.  **UP (7, 2):** Safe move, moves towards center/apples.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 0):** Safe move, moves low.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 1):** Hits an apple (6, 1)! If S0 eats (6, 1), it grows.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 1):** Safe move, moves towards edge.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to eat (6, 1), its new head is (6, 1).\n\n---\n**Step 4: Check Collisions (S1 move vs T0)**\n\n*   **S1 moves UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   T0 predictions: None overlap (6, 9). Safe from S0 head.\n\n*   **S1 moves DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   T0 predictions:\n        *   If S0 goes LEFT to (6, 1): No collision.\n        *   If S0 goes UP to (7, 2): No collision.\n    *   If S0 goes to (6, 1), S1 moves (6, 8) -> (6, 7). Still safe.\n\n*   **S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   T0 predictions: None overlap (7, 8). Safe from S0 head.\n\nAll three safe moves appear safe from immediate head collisions.\n\n---\n**Step 5: Strategy & Apple Acquisition**\n\nMy current position (6, 8) is excellent. I am now adjacent (only 1 unit away vertically) from both target apples (8, 6) and (7, 6).\n\nPath 1: UP (6, 9). Requires correcting course soon. Distance to targets: 2 units in X, 3 units in Y minimum.\nPath 2: DOWN (6, 7). Excellent step toward Y=6. Distance to targets: 1 or 2 units in X, 1 unit in Y minimum to hit (7, 6) or (8, 6) next turn if S0 cooperates by staying low.\nPath 3: RIGHT (7, 8). Excellent step toward X=7, X=8. Distance to targets: 1 unit in X, 2 units in Y minimum.\n\nComparing DOWN (6, 7) vs RIGHT (7, 8):\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7): Next move can be RIGHT to (7, 7), then UP/RIGHT toward the apples.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 8): Next move can be DOWN to (7, 7), then RIGHT/DOWN toward the apples.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT seem excellent for closing the gap towards (7, 6) and (8, 6).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7), I slightly overcommit to the vertical axis before securing horizontal progress.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 8), I make good horizontal progress while staying adjacent to my current high vertical position.\n\nLet's prioritize horizontal movement towards the target X coordinates (7 and 8). (7, 8) seems marginally better as it prepares a direct approach to (7, 6) faster than starting from X=6.\n\nWe must consider S0 eating apple (6, 1) via LEFT move to (6, 1). If S0 eats, it gains a segment, potentially growing its tail away from my current zone of interest. (Its tail would move from (1, 4) to (1, 5) then grow).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 8):\nT46 prediction options:\n*   S1 (7, 8) -> DOWN (7, 7). Reaches midfield elevation quickly.\n*   S1 (7, 8) -> RIGHT (8, 8). Prepares to dive for (8, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (6, 7):\nT46 prediction options:\n*   S1 (6, 7) -> RIGHT (7, 7). Same as above.\n*   S1 (6, 7) -> RIGHT (7, 7) -> RIGHT (8, 7) -> DOWN (8, 6) (Eating apple in 3 turns).\n\nBoth are very strong attacking lines. I will choose RIGHT (7, 8) as it immediately increases my X coordinate towards the target, and (7, 8) -> DOWN to (7, 7) is a powerful follow-up that puts me in a central location to choose between (7, 6) or (8, 6) on T47.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nMaintain progress towards the cluster of apples (8, 6) and (7, 6). Prioritize moves that reduce the Chebyshev distance to these targets while respecting safety constraints from S0 (who is currently far away at Y=0/1). Do not get trapped targeting the edge apple (0, 6) unless an opportunity arises or the main cluster vanishes.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Previous length was 12. New length is 13.\nIf S0 moved (7, 1) -> (6, 1) and ate:\nNew S0 Head: (6, 1).\nNew S0 Body: [(7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. (Tail shifts from (1, 3) to (1, 4) if it didn't grow).\n*Crucially, the board state provided in the setup seems to reflect the state *after* Turn 45's moves, not the state *before* Turn 46. I must use the board state provided for T46 setup.*\n\n**Board State for T46 Analysis (Setup):**\nS1 Head: (7, 8)\nS1 Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\nS0 Head: (6, 1)\nS0 Body: [(7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)] (Length 12, matching the provided list exactly).\n\n*Correction based on board state:* Snake 0 did **not** eat the apple at (6, 1) last turn, since its head is shown at (6, 1) but it has **12 apples** (meaning no growth this round resulted in 12 segments total, plus the head). If the board state reflects the end of T45, and S0's last move resulted in Head (6, 1), then it **MUST have eaten** the apple at (6, 1) if it moved there. However, the provided body list shows S0 length consistent with 12 points collected, which matches its previous count. If (6, 1) was an apple at T45 start:\nIf S0 moved (7, 1) -> (6, 1) (LEFT) and ate: It should have 13 apples and 13 segments.\nThe board state implies:\n1. S0 moved from (7, 1) to (6, 1) [Eating the apple A at (6, 1)]\n2. S1 moved from (6, 8) to (7, 8) [RIGHT]\n\nSince the apple list for T46 shows (6, 1) is **empty**, S0 *must* have eaten it. Therefore, S0 has 13 apples now, and its segment count must be 13 (Head + Body). The provided body list is 12 segments long, which conflicts with the logic that S0 ate an apple at (6, 1) if that was its destination.\n**I must strictly trust the provided board state lists over inferred segment counts unless a collision is imminent.** S0 has 12 segments listed in the body + head = 13 total segments if it ate (6, 1). Since the count is exactly 12 segments listed in the body + head, it implies S0 *did not* eat (6, 1) and perhaps moved elsewhere, OR the board representation is slightly off regarding the tail based on the previous turn's growth.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will prioritize safety against the *listed endpoints* for S0.\nS0 Head: (6, 1). Forbidden Self-Targets (S0): (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2). (Tail (1, 2) is the oldest segment that might move off).\n\n---\n**Step 1: Determine Safe Moves for S1 from (7, 8)**\n\n*   **UP (7, 9):** Safe from self.\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** Safe from self.\n*   **LEFT (6, 8):** Hits own body (6, 8). **DEAD**.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 8):** Safe from self.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (7, 9), (7, 7), (8, 8).\n\n---\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Moves from (6, 1)**\nS0 is low, score leader (though possibly 13 apples now), and its body spreads across the bottom. Apples remaining: (9, 4), (8, 6), (7, 6), (0, 6), (2, 2).\n\nPotential S0 moves (T0) from (6, 1):\n1.  **UP (6, 2):** Moves towards (2, 2). Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 0):** Hits own body (6, 0). **DEAD** (if body segments don't shift this turn, which they will). Its body includes (6, 0). S0 cannot move DOWN unless (6, 0) is the tail that shifts off. Since S0 has 12 body segments, (6, 0) is the 5th segment from the head, deep within the body. **S0 cannot move DOWN.**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 1):** Hits own body (5, 1). **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 1):** Hits own body (7, 1). **DEAD.**\n\n*Wait, this suggests S0 is completely trapped if it moves based on its current body configuration.* This is a huge advantage for S1. For S0 to survive, it must move UP, or its tail must shift off significantly, freeing up a space.\n\nIf S0 is trapped by its own body, it MUST move UP to (6, 2) to avoid dying, assuming the tail end segment moves off next turn. Let's re-examine the body shift assumption for S0:\nIf S0 length L=13 (12 body + head), the tail is the 13th segment. If the board shows 12 body segments, the total length is 13. The tail is the last element: (1, 2). This segment will advance to the position formerly occupied by the segment before it in the previous turn to maintain the length, or simply vacate its current spot if the move is non-eating.\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 2), the segment at (1, 2) will vacate its spot. (6, 0), (5, 1), (7, 1) remain occupied. S0 still cannot move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN if it stays put.\n\n**Conclusion on S0:** S0 is heavily constricted. Its only viable move that respects its current body layout is **UP to (6, 2)**, which is moving away from the main apple cluster it failed to reach last turn, but towards apple (2, 2).\n\n---\n**Step 3: Check Collisions (S1 move vs T0)**\nS1 Head (7, 8). S0 Head predicts (6, 2).\n\n*   **S1 moves UP to (7, 9):** Safe from S0 head (6, 2).\n*   **S1 moves DOWN to (7, 7):** Safe from S0 head (6, 2).\n*   **S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe from S0 head (6, 2).\n\nAll three safe options from S1 remain safe from S0 head collision based on the most likely S0 move (UP).\n\n---\n**Step 4: Strategy**\nS1 achieved its preferred move last turn (RIGHT to (7, 8) in the rationale, resulting in the actual position of (7, 8) this turn, if the initial state was (6, 8)).\nThe target apples are (8, 6) and (7, 6). We are at Y=8, need to move down to Y=7, then Y=6.\n\nPrevious move was RIGHT to (7, 8). Next logical step is DOWN to bring Y coordinate closer to 6.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** Excellent. This brings S1 to the exact horizontal line of the target apples, 1 unit away vertically. Upon reaching (7, 7), the next move can target (7, 6) or move sideways towards (8, 6).\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Moves further away from the Y=6 line.\n3.  **UP to (7, 9):** Wastes a turn moving away from the target cluster.\n\nMove DOWN to (7, 7) is the best aggressive move towards the high-value targets (7, 6) and (8, 6). Since S0 is likely forced into (6, 2), there is no immediate danger.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move DOWN to (7, 7). On T47, aim for RIGHT (8, 7) or DOWN (7, 6) depending on S0's subsequent move, but (7, 6) intersection is the priority path. We aim to secure one of these two apples before S0 can complete its potentially long journey from the bottom edge toward the center/top.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Targets apple (7, 6).\n*   **LEFT (6, 7):** Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe from self.\n\nSafe S1 Destinations: (7, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7).\n\n---\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Moves from (6, 2)**\nBased on the previous turn analysis, S0 was heavily constrained. The consensus best move was **UP to (6, 3)**, as moving sideways or down resulted in immediate self-collision with its dense lower-body structure near the edges. We assume S0 chose (6, 3) as it was the only non-suicidal move available that respects the body segment positions listed on T46.\n\nPredicted S0 Head (T47): (6, 3).\n\n---\n**Step 3: Check Collisions (S1 move vs T0)**\nS1 Head (7, 7). Predicted S0 Head moves to (6, 3).\n\n*   **S1 moves DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe from S0 head (6, 3). *This move eats Apple A at (7, 6).*\n*   **S1 moves LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe from S0 head (6, 3).\n*   **S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe from S0 head (6, 3).\n\nAll three safe options remain safe from immediate head collision.\n\n---\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nS1 currently has 5 apples, S0 has 12. We must prioritize eating.\nThe available apples are now: (9, 4), (8, 6), (0, 6), (2, 2).\n\nThe move **DOWN to (7, 6)** results in eating the apple at (7, 6). This is highly favorable as it increases our score immediately and positions us well relative to the neighbor (8, 6).\n\nIf we move to (7, 6):\nS1 Head becomes (7, 6). New Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)]. Length 7.\n\nS0, predicted at (6, 3), is moving towards the center/top, away from our nearest targets (8, 6) and (9, 4).\n\n**Evaluation of (7, 6) vs (8, 7):**\n*   (7, 6) eats an apple and puts us in danger of being enveloped if S0 targets (8, 6)/ (9, 6) path next, but it's high reward now.\n*   (8, 7) moves us closer to (9, 4) but ignores the immediate apple (7, 6).\n\nEating the apple is the strongest incentive here. We want to grow before S0 can secure a lead too far ahead.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure (7, 6) now. On the next turn (T48), if S0 moves towards the top center (e.g., (6, 4) or (5, 3)), S1 should aim RIGHT to (8, 6) to collect the second apple in that cluster, or move LEFT to (6, 6) to keep maneuvering space, depending on S0's exact position next turn. Immediate apple gain is prioritized.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body: [(6, 2), (6, 1), ...].\nPotential moves for S0:\n*   UP (5, 3): Safe from self.\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Hits own body segment (5, 1) or (5, 0) depending on exact interpretation, but critically blocked by the dense lower body structure. (6, 1) is segment 2. (5, 1) is segment 9. Moving to (5, 1) is hitting body. **DEAD**.\n*   LEFT (4, 2): Safe from self.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Hits own body (6, 2). **DEAD**.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (5, 3), (4, 2).\n\nSince S0 is near the bottom left quadrant and we are top middle, we prioritize apples near us.\n\n**Step 3: Check Collisions (S1 move vs Predicted S0 moves)**\n\nS1 Options: (7, 5), (6, 6), (8, 6).\nS0 Options: (5, 3), (4, 2).\n\nThere are no immediate head-to-head collision risks, as S0 is far away.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nWe have 7 apples, S0 has 12. We need to catch up. We have two immediate apple targets in our vicinity: (8, 6) and (9, 4).\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (8, 6):** Eats the apple A at (8, 6). S1 Score becomes 8. New head position is excellent for reaching (9, 4) next turn, or maneuvering towards (9, 8).\n2.  **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe, but does not secure an apple. Keeps options open towards (0, 6) or maneuvering along the top edge.\n3.  **Move DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe, but moves away from all currently visible apples.\n\nThe best move is clearly to eat the nearest apple at (8, 6). This increases our score/length, making us slightly safer, and positions us aggressively toward the other nearby apples.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8, 6):\nS1 Head becomes (8, 6). New Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)]. Length 8.\nS0, predicting (5, 3) or (4, 2), will move further into the central/bottom area.\n\nLong-term plan: This move capitalizes on the immediate apple availability after securing (7, 6) last turn. We aim to clear the top-right cluster of apples ((8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 8)) before S0 can significantly encroach on that area, as S0 seems trapped low initially but could break out.\n\nRIGHT seems optimal.\n\nRIGHT",

(Length 12, Tail (3, 1)).\n\nPotential moves for S0:\n*   UP (4, 3): Safe from self.\n*   DOWN (4, 1): Hits own body segment (4, 1). **DEAD**.\n*   LEFT (3, 2): Safe from self.\n*   RIGHT (5, 2): Hits own body (5, 2). **DEAD**.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (4, 3), (3, 2).\n\n**Step 3: Check Collisions (S1 move vs Predicted S0 moves)**\nS1 Options: (8, 7), (8, 5), (9, 6).\nS0 Options: (4, 3), (3, 2).\nSince S0 is far from S1, there are no immediate head-to-head collisions or self-kill collision risks this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nLast move was RIGHT to (8, 6), eating an apple (Score 8).\nRemaining Apples: A1=(9, 4), A2=(0, 6), A3=(2, 2), A4=(9, 8), A5=(2, 6).\n\nWe are currently at (8, 6) and have a cluster of apples in the top right corner: (9, 4) and (9, 8). We are in good position to sweep this area.\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (9, 6):** This is the most committed move toward the top right corner. There is no apple at (9, 6) currently. It places us adjacent to (9, 8) for the subsequent turn.\n2.  **Move UP to (8, 7):** Moves towards (9, 8), but slightly less direct than going right first, as we might want to sweep (9, 4) first.\n3.  **Move DOWN to (8, 5):** Moves towards (9, 4). This seems highly efficient as (9, 4) is the closest apple in that quadrant now.\n\nComparing DOWN (8, 5) vs RIGHT (9, 6):\nIf we go DOWN to (8, 5), next turn we can move RIGHT to (9, 5) then potentially UP/RIGHT to (9, 4) or (9, 8).\nIf we go RIGHT to (9, 6), next turn we can move UP to (9, 7) then RIGHT/UP to (9, 8).\n\nIf we move **DOWN (8, 5)**:\nT50: If S0 moves to (4, 3) or (3, 2). S1 moves towards (9, 4).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5) (Safe).\nIf S1 moves UP to (8, 6) (Backwards).\nIf S1 moves UP to (8, 6) is impossible as it's the previous head location (7, 6) is the body segment. (8, 6) is the current head. (8, 7) is already blocked this turn.\n\nLet's re-evaluate approach based on apple proximity:\n(9, 4) is 2 steps away (DOWN, RIGHT).\n(9, 8) is 3 steps away (RIGHT, UP, UP).\n\nMoving **DOWN to (8, 5)** sets up a clear path to (9, 4) by moving RIGHT next turn to (9, 5) and then RIGHT or UP.\nIf we move **DOWN to (8, 5)**:\nT50: If S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5). Now S1 is one step away from (9, 4).\nIf S1 moves **RIGHT to (9, 6)**:\nT50: If S1 moves UP to (9, 7). Now S1 is two steps away from (9, 8), and two steps away from (9, 4) (via (9, 5)).\n\nMoving toward (9, 4) seems marginally better prioritization since it is closer. **DOWN** achieves this goal while remaining entirely safe.\n\nLong Term Plan: Clear the top right apples (9, 4) and (9, 8), then assess the remaining apples at (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 2). Snake S0 is currently trapped in the lower left quadrant and poses very little threat unless it manages a significant breakout move. Focus on scoring.\n\nDOWN",

S0 last move was the move *before* T50, which led to board state (3, 2). Since my last move was DOWN to (8, 5), the board update has already happened for T50.\n\nS0 Body (Head to Tail, inferred from board): [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1)]. (Tail is (4, 1) or possibly (3, 1) if it grew previously and this list missed the tail update, but following the provided list structure and board: the segment behind (3, 2) is (4, 2)).\n\nForbidden Self-Targets (S0): (4, 2) [Backwards], (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1).\n\n*   **UP (3, 3):** Safe from self.\n*   **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe from self.\n*   **LEFT (2, 2):** Hits apple (A3 at (2, 2)).

This seems like the most direct, aggressive, and safe growth path. If we eat (9, 4), we will have 8 apples.\n2.  **Move DOWN to (8, 4):** This moves away from the cluster (9, 4), (9, 8) toward the center bottom, which feels counter-intuitive to the current positioning.\n3.  **Move LEFT to (7, 5):** Moves away from apples, toward the middle of the board.\n\nThe highest priority is collecting (9, 4). Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) positions us perfectly for that.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5):\nT51: S1 can move DOWN to (9, 4) to eat A1.

No.\n*   Does any S0 head land on S1 body? No S0 move intersects with S1 body.\n\nB) If S1 chooses **DOWN (9, 4)**:\n*   Does (9, 4) hit S0 body? No.\n*   Does any S0 head land on S1 body? No S0 move intersects with S1 body.\n\nBoth potential moves for S1 are safe concerning instant death via collision or boundary violation.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\n\nApples remaining: A1=(9, 4), A2=(0, 6), A3=(2, 2), A4=(9, 8), A5=(2, 6).\nS1 Score: 7. S0 Score: 13.\n\nThe previous move plan was to move RIGHT to (9, 5) in order to set up eating (9, 4) this turn (Turn 51). However, the last move chosen was RIGHT, leading to Head (9, 5).\n\nCurrent Head: (9, 5).\nLast Move Rationale Analysis: The logic in the previous turn correctly identified that moving RIGHT to (9, 5) was the best setup move. Now, we execute the follow-up.\n\nThe move **DOWN** to **(9, 4)** eats Apple A1. This grows the snake and brings the score to 8. This is the highest priority.\n\nIf we choose UP to (9, 6), we skip the apple (9, 4) and position ourselves to potentially pursue A4 (9, 8) later, but we leave A1 vulnerable (though S0 is nowhere near). S0 might eat A3 (2, 2) if it moves LEFT.\n\nEating the closest apple is the optimal greedy strategy here, as it's safe and yields immediate benefit.\n\nMove choice: DOWN (to (9, 4)).\n\nLong-Term Plan Note: Eat (9, 4) this turn. Next priority is (9, 8) or circling around to secure (2, 6) / (0, 6) if S0 shows interest in the top right. Since S0 is currently focused on the bottom left/center, securing the remaining top-right apple (9, 8) seems like the next best target after this guaranteed gain.\n\nDOWN",

No S0 move intersects with S1 body.\n\nBoth potential moves for S1 are safe concerning instant death via collision or boundary violation.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\n\nS1 Score: 8. (A1 at (9, 4) was eaten last turn).\nApples remaining: A2=(0, 6), A4=(9, 8), A5=(2, 6), A3=(2, 2) -> Wait, checking map/score:\nTurn 51: Apples at: (0, 6), (9, 8), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 8). S1 ate (9, 4).\nThe description of apples *after* my move (Turn 51 picking DOWN to (9, 4)) should be used for Turn 52 planning.\n\nThe apple list provided *at the start of Turn 52* is: (0, 6), (9, 8), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 8).\nThis implies that the apple at (9, 4) was already consumed by S1 on T51, but it's not listed as consumed in the main score summary (it should be 8 apples collected after the move). The score summary says S1 has 8 apples. This confirms the (9, 4) apple was eaten by S1 and S1 is now at length 9. The new apples list confirms the game state moved on, and (9, 4) is gone.\n\nS1 Priority Targets: (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 8), (9, 8).\n\n*   Move **DOWN (9, 3)**: Moves S1 down the edge. Keeps S1 close to the right edge, which might be useful for hunting (9, 8) later, but it moves away from the main cluster of apples (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5). Safe, but non-committal regarding apples.\n*   Move **LEFT (8, 4)**: Moves S1 inward, towards future paths to Y=6 or Y=8 apples. This seems strategically better for repositioning towards the remaining apples, especially those clustered around X=2.\n\nS0 is currently positioned near X=2, Y=3. S0 has paths $(2, 4), (1, 3), (3, 3)$. S0 seems focused on controlling the middle/left side or potentially climbing towards (2, 6) or (0, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 4), S1 is safely transitioning towards the center board area where future apples are located, while S0 is moving away from the right side entirely.\n\nBetween the two safe moves, LEFT (8, 4) seems better for general board presence and converging towards the bulk of remaining apples (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5). DOWN (9, 3) keeps S1 constrained to the edge longer.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move LEFT to (8, 4) to gain better central access. Next goal is to move towards the X=2/X=0 region to acquire the clustered apples (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5). We need to watch S0 closely as it controls much of that space currently.\n\nLEFT\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Score: 13.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Immediate Safety for S1 from Head (8, 4)**\nS1 Body (Head to Tail): [(8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8)]. (Tail is (6, 8), since S1 ate the apple at (9, 4) last turn and grew).\nThe position immediately behind the head (T52 position) is (9, 4).\nForbidden Self-Targets (S1): (9, 4) [Backwards], (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8).\n\n*   **UP (8, 5):** Hits own body segment. **DEAD**.\n*   **DOWN (8, 3):** Hits empty space. Safe from self.\n*   **LEFT (7, 4):** Hits empty space. Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 4):** Hits own body segment (backwards move). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe immediate destinations for S1: (8, 3), (7, 4). (Both are safe from self-collision and boundaries).\n\n*Self-Correction/Review of Previous Turn Rationale:*\nMy last move was LEFT, resulting in Head (8, 4). The rationale selected LEFT (8, 4) from head (9, 4) *before* the previous move calculation confirmed the resulting position.\nTurn 52 S1: Head (9, 4) -> Move LEFT -> New Head (8, 4).\nS1 body *after* T52 move (Length 9): [(8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8)].\nThe actual segment the head just left is (9, 4). This is correctly identified above as the backwards cell for T53 planning.\n\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Moves from Head (2, 4)**\nTurn 52 S0 moved from (2, 3) to (2, 4).\nBoard shows S0 head at (2, 4).\nS0 Body (Head to Tail, inferred from board): [(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]. (Length 15, tail seems to have grown longer, note that S0 has 13 apples, so length should be 14 + 1 = 15, or 13 + 1 = 14 if they started at length 1). S0 has 13 apples, so length is 14 positions if starting length 1, or 15 if starting length 2. Given the map length appears 14 positions long, let's assume length 14 (13 apples).\nThe position immediately behind the head (T52 position) is (2, 3).\nForbidden Self-Targets (S0): (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0). (Assuming tail piece shown at (5, 0) is correctly the tail).\n\n*   **UP (2, 5):** Safe from self.\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Hits own body segment (backwards move). **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT (1, 4):** Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe from self.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4).\n\n**Step 3: Check Collisions (S1 move vs S0 moves)**\n\nS1 Options: (8, 3), (7, 4).\nS0 Options: (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4).\n\nA) If S1 chooses **DOWN (8, 3)**:\n*   Does (8, 3) collide with any S0 destination? No.\n*   Does any S0 head land on S1 body [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8)]? No.\n\nB) If S1 chooses **LEFT (7, 4)**:\n*   Does (7, 4) collide with any S0 destination? No.\n*   Does any S0 head land on S1 body?\n    *   If S0 moves UP to (2, 5): No collision.\n    *   If S0 moves LEFT to (1, 4): No collision.\n    *   If S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 4): No collision.\n\nBoth S1 moves are safe from immediate collision and self-harm.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nRemaining Apples: (0, 6), (9, 8), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 8).\n\nS1 is currently at (8, 4).\nApples (2, 5), (2, 6), (0, 6) form a cluster on the left/middle board. (9, 8) and (2, 8) are outliers. S0 controls the area around X=1, 2 currently.\n\nA) Move **DOWN (8, 3)**: Moves S1 down the right side. This keeps S1 far from the main apple cluster. S0 might move UP to (2, 5) or (2, 6) region next turn. This feels too passive/detatched.\n\nB) Move **LEFT (7, 4)**: Moves S1 one step closer to the cluster of apples at X=2 and X=0.\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) could set up a convergence on (2, 5) or (2, 6) in 3-4 turns, assuming S0 doesn't block the path entirely.\n\nS0 at (2, 4) has options (2, 5) [Up, towards A(2, 5), A(2, 6)], (1, 4) [Left], (3, 4) [Right]. If S0 prioritizes apples, (2, 5) is likely, positioning it right on top of A(2, 5).\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 4), S1 is aggressively moving towards the apple concentration. If S0 moves UP to (2, 5), S0 captures A(2, 5) next turn, but S1 is closing the gap.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT, and S0 moves UP to (2, 5):\nT54: S1 @ (7, 4), S0 @ (2, 5) [S0 eats (2, 5), score 14].\nS1 can then move LEFT to (6, 4), continuing convergence. S0 is now slightly ahead in the race for the cluster.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN, and S0 moves UP to (2, 5):\nT54: S1 @ (8, 3), S0 @ (2, 5) [S0 eats (2, 5), score 14].\nS1 is now further away from the center action than necessary.\n\nLEFT seems like the necessary proactive move to engage the central apples contested by the numerically superior snake S0. We must try to keep pace.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Execute LEFT moves to gain better central board access, aiming to corner apples (0, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6). Maintain vigilance against S0's growth and potential for trapping. If S0 moves defensively or away from the cluster, S1 can aggressively seize the apple(s) in the next turn with a quicker path.\n\nLEFT",

(Note: (2, 5), (2, 6) were previously listed in general list but (2, 5) was just eaten by S0, (2, 6) is the next target for S0).\n\nS1 is at (7, 4). S0 is at (2, 5) and will likely eat A(2, 6) next turn if heading UP towards (2, 6). S0 controls the left/middle portion heavily.\nS1 has two immediate goals:\n1. Race for A(9, 8) in the top right corner OR\n2. Move towards the remaining scattered apples (0, 6) and (3, 1).\n\nS1 needs to move towards the closest remaining high-value area or try to cut S0 off.\n\nOption A: UP (7, 5). Continues vertical movement, possibly aiming for (9, 8) eventually, though this path is slow and leaves the center open.\nIf S1 moves UP to (7, 5), S0 likely moves UP to (2, 6) (eating it, score 15). S1 is now behind in the score race and still far from everything.\n\nOption B: DOWN (7, 3). Moves further away from A(9, 8) and the central apples. Seems too passive.\n\nOption C: LEFT (6, 4). This is aggressive movement towards the center/left border, aligning S1 to potentially intercept S0's path or move towards A(0, 6) or A(3, 1).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (6, 4), S0 likely takes (2, 6).\nT55: S1 @ (6, 4), S0 @ (2, 6) [S0 eats (2, 6), score 15].\nS1 can then move LEFT again to (5, 4), pursuing the left side of the board adjacent to S0's body extension, or move toward (3, 1). This aims to force S0 to make defensive moves or secure the far side apples.\n\nGiven S0 has eaten the (2, 5) apple and is positioned well to eat (2, 6) next, S1 needs to secure positional advantage elsewhere. A(9, 8) is currently isolated. Moving LEFT (6, 4) is the best way to bring S1 into the main action area or set up a quicker path to A(0, 6) or A(3, 1) in subsequent turns than moving straight up/down. It keeps S1's body stretched out horizontally, which is often safer than vertical stretching if S0 decides to approach from the side.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move aggressively towards the left/center of the board in order to intercept S0's path or gain access to A(0, 6) and A(3, 1). Prioritize positioning over immediately racing to the isolated A(9, 8) currently. Stick to LEFT moves if safe.\n\nLEFT",

S0 just ate A(2, 6) last turn (Turn 54 move was UP to (2, 6) which ate the apple there). S0 score is now 15, length 16.\nThe position immediately behind the head (T54 position) is (2, 5), which S0 just left.\nForbidden Self-Targets (S0): (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0).\n\n*   **UP (2, 7):** Safe from self.\n*   **DOWN (2, 5):** Hits own body segment (backwards move leads into cell S0 abandoned last turn, which is safe, but this is the direction S0 *just* came from, so it contains the segment before (2, 5) if S0 hasn't eaten yet. Wait, S0 ate the apple at (2, 6) last turn. The body list reflects the state *after* the move. S0 moved from (2, 5) to (2, 6) and grew. The segment *behind* (2, 6) is (2, 5). Moving to (2, 5) is moving backwards into the segment just vacated IF the tail didn't move. Since S0 ate, its tail didn't move, so (2, 5) is indeed the segment immediately preceding (2, 6) in the list, meaning moving DOWN to (2, 5) is hitting the tail segment that was just there. **DEAD** based on rule 4 (moving into body, which includes the point vacated by the head if the tail hasn't shrunk yet - which it hasn't since S0 just ate).\n*   **LEFT (1, 6):** Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 6):** Safe from self.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (2, 7), (1, 6), (3, 6).\n\n**Step 3: Check S1 move safety against S0 predictions**\nS1 Options: (6, 5), (6, 3), (5, 4).\nS0 Options: (2, 7), (1, 6), (3, 6).\n\nS1 Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)].\n\nA) S1 moves UP to (6, 5):\n    *   No collision with S0 body segments (they are all clustered on the bottom left).\n    *   No head-on collision possible due to distance.\n(6, 5) is safe.\n\nB) S1 moves DOWN to (6, 3):\n    *   No collision with S0 body segments.\n(6, 3) is safe.\n\nC) S1 moves LEFT to (5, 4):\n    *   No collision with S0 body segments.\n(5, 4) is safe.\n\nAll three moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nApples remaining: (0, 6), (9, 8), (2, 8), (3, 1), (4, 5).\n\nS1 is at (6, 4). S0 is at (2, 6) and is growing rapidly (15 apples). S0 is dominating the left/middle area. S1 must try to secure apples on the opposite side or cut S0 off from future growth.\n\nS1's previous move was LEFT to (6, 4). The rationale for moving towards the center/left side seems sound to challenge S0's control. Now that S1 is at (6, 4), the safest and most strategic move is likely to continue this pressure or aim for the closest viable apple.\n\n*   **Move UP (6, 5):** Next turn, potentially reach (6, 6) or (5, 5) aiming towards the top right (9, 8) or center (4, 5). This keeps S1 somewhat central.\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 3):** Moves away from the cluster of apples (0, 6), (4, 5), (3, 1) and isolates S1 further. Less competitive.\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 4):** Aggressively moves toward the left edge, aiming for A(0, 6) or A(3, 1). This path forces S0 to react defensively if S1 tries to cross the board, or allows S1 to sweep the remaining left/bottom apples.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (5, 4):\nT56: S1 @ (5, 4). S0 likely moves to (2, 7) or (1, 6) to continue expanding upwards/leftwards.\nIf S0 moves to (2, 7), S1 is closer to A(3, 1) and A(0, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (6, 5):\nT56: S1 @ (6, 5). S0 likely stays aggressive upwards. S1 is still relatively central but less committed to one side.\n\nGiven S0's strong position on the left quadrant, S1 should try to seize control of the remaining isolated apples (0, 6), (3, 1), (4, 5) before S0 can cut off movement paths. Moving LEFT (5, 4) positions S1 better to access (3, 1) and (0, 6) in the next couple of turns, while still maintaining some distance from S0's current body mass. Continuing the horizontal pressure established by the previous LEFT move seems best.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving aggressively towards the left/bottom side of the board to secure apples (3, 1) and (0, 6). Avoid unnecessary vertical movement that lengthens the path to these apples. Maintain distance from S0's expanding head path.\n\nLEFT",

S0 is at (2, 7) and is threatening A(2, 8).\n\n1.  **S1 moves UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   S0 might take A(2, 8).

S1 needs to acquire apples rapidly.\nTargeting A(4, 5) seems easier from (5, 5) or (4, 4) than from other spots.\n(5, 5) is 1 move away from A(4, 5) (Move LEFT to (4, 5)).\n(4, 4) is 1 move away from A(4, 5) (Move RIGHT to (5, 5), then UP, or move UP/LEFT diagonally).

S0 score 16.\n\nBoth (4, 4) and (5, 5) lead to eating A(4, 5) next turn.\n\nMoving Left (4, 4) positions S1 better for cutting off A(3, 1) or A(0, 6) subsequently, as it continues the pressure initiated by the previous move. Moving Up (5, 5) keeps S1 slightly more centralized, perhaps giving more flexibility around the center mass of S0's body if S0 expands aggressively rightward later, but S0 is currently very consolidated on the left side.\n\nGiven S0 is guaranteed to take A(2, 8) by going UP next turn, S1 should prioritize the next closest accessible apple, A(4, 5). Both (4, 4) and (5, 5) achieve this in T57. I will choose LEFT (4, 4) to keep progressing toward the lower-left apples (0, 6) and (3, 1) after securing (4, 5).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Secure A(4, 5) next turn. Then assess the positions of S0 and remaining apples ((0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1)) to decide whether to pursue the lower left cluster or cut across toward (9, 8). Continue to maintain defensive distance from S0's main mass.\n\nLEFT",

Score 8.\nS0 Head: (2, 7). S0 Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. Score 15.\nApples remaining: A(0, 6), A(9, 8), A(2, 8), A(3, 1), A(4, 5).\n\n**T56 Move Confirmation:** S1 moved LEFT to (5, 4) [Note: The problem description states the HEAD is (4, 4) for T57, meaning S1's move on T56 was LEFT from (5, 4) to (4, 4), or the head coordinates provided at the top are the *result* of T56 move].\n\nLet's reconcile the input:\nProvided Head for T57: (4, 4).\nLast Move Rationale stated S1 chose LEFT, moving from (5, 4) to (4, 4). This means S1's move on T56 resulted in the current head position (4, 4).\nIf S1 chose LEFT in the rationale, the position *after* the move would be (4, 4).\nHowever, the structure implies:\n1. Determine move for T56 based on T55 state. (Rationale determined LEFT was chosen).\n2. State reflects positions *after* T56 move.\n\nIf Head is (4, 4) for T57:\nThe previous head location must have been (5, 4) if the move was LEFT.\nIf the move was LEFT ((5, 4) -> (4, 4)), then S1 ate that apple it moved towards in T56, or the body reflects the new state after S1 ate something, or the body listed is outdated relative to the head position (4, 4).\n\nLet's assume the **START OF TURN 57** state is exactly as listed:\nS1 Head: (4, 4).\nStandard S1 Length: 9 (8 apples + 1 initial segment). Total segments = 8 (body) + 1 (head) = 9. If S1 collected 8 apples, length should be 9. The body list has 8 elements. Total segments = 9. This is consistent with Score 8.\n\nIf the head is (4, 4):\nS1 Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\nIf the head *just* moved to (4, 4), the segment previously at (4, 4) should be the segment now behind the head. Since (4, 4) is not in the body list, this implies S1 **ate an apple** on the move that resulted in Head=(4, 4). If S1 ate an apple, Score should be 9, not 8.\n\n**Crucial Interpretation Check:** The input format usually lists the state *before* the current move calculation. If the Rationale states 'LEFT' was picked, leading to (4,4), and the current score is 8, it suggests S1 moved to (4, 4) but *did not* eat an apple (perhaps A(4, 5) was not reachable, or S0 blocked it).\n\nLet's use the explicit current data provided at the top, regardless of the Rationale's description of the *last* move's outcome, as the top data defines the current board state for Turn 57 decisions.\n\n**T57 Initial Board State:**\nS1 Head: (4, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]. Length 9, Score 8.\nS0 Head: (2, 8). Body: [...] Length 16 (was 15 + eaten apple A(2, 8) implied by movement/score discrepancy), Score 16.\nApples: (0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1), (4, 5), (5, 6).\n\nIf S0 Head is (2, 8) and Score is 16 (15 points previously), S0 *must* have eaten A(2, 8) on T56.\nIf S1 Head is (4, 4) and Score is 8, S1 either did not eat an apple on T56, or the listed body length is slightly off/misleading regarding the tail growth. Since the length is 9 (8 body elements + head), 8 apples is correct. S1 did NOT eat an apple on T56.\n\n**S1 move on T56:** S1 must have moved from (5, 4) to (4, 4) without eating an apple. This means S0 must have been between (5, 4) and (4, 4) if collision occurred, or (4, 4) was empty. Given the safety calculus, LEFT to (4, 4) without eating confirms the T56 move was LEFT, but A(4, 5) was not reached/eaten.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Immediate Safety for S1 from Head (4, 4)**\nS1 Body (Excludes Self-Backwards target, which is (5, 4)): [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\nForbidden Self-Targets: (5, 4) [Backwards], (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6).\n\n*   **UP (4, 5):** Safe from self. (A(4, 5) is here!).\n*   **DOWN (4, 3):** Safe from self.\n*   **LEFT (3, 4):** Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 4):** Hits own body segment (backwards move is (5, 4) if body listed tail-to-head? No, head-to-tail: (5, 4) is immediately behind (4, 4)). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe possible moves for S1: (4, 5), (4, 3), (3, 4).\n\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Moves from Head (2, 8)**\nS0 Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. Length 17 (due to eating A(2, 8)).\nThe position immediately behind the head (T56 position) is (2, 7).\nForbidden Self-Targets (S0): (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0).\n\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Safe from self. (Edge of board).\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):** Hits own body segment (backwards move). **DEAD**.\n*   **LEFT (1, 8):** Safe from self.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Safe from self.\n\nS0 Safe Destinations: (2, 9), (1, 8), (3, 8).\n\n**Step 3: Check S1 move safety against S0 predictions (Head-to-Head Collisions)**\nS1 Options: (4, 5) [Apple], (4, 3), (3, 4).\nS0 Options: (2, 9), (1, 8), (3, 8).\nNo immediate collision possible due to distance.\n\n**Step 4: Strategy and Apple Acquisition**\nApples remaining: A(0, 6), A(9, 8), A(3, 1), A(4, 5), A(5, 6).\n\nS1 must target A(4, 5) immediately, as moving to (4, 5) is a safe, immediate move, and it's now adjacent to the head.\n\nIf S1 moves **UP to (4, 5)**: S1 eats the apple.\nT57 End State: S1 Head (4, 5). Score 9. Body grows.\nS0 moves to (2, 9), (1, 8), or (3, 8). S0 likely moves towards (2, 9) or (3, 8) to maintain centralization or edge control, or perhaps toward A(0, 6) vicinity if (1, 8) chosen.\n\nIf S1 moves:\n1. (3, 4) [LEFT]: Moving further away from A(4, 5). S0 might move to (3, 8) or (2, 9). S1 would have to move back up to (4, 5) next turn, conceding S0 the chance to react or move towards another target.\n2. (4, 3) [DOWN]: Moving towards A(3, 1), but passing through (3, 4) or (4, 2) territory. Less direct than UP.\n3. (4, 5) [UP]: Eats the apple. Direct and fulfills the previously calculated best immediate target.\n\nSince moving UP (4, 5) results in consuming an apple immediately, this is the highest priority move, assuming it remains safe from S0 (which it is).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nSecure A(4, 5) now. Length 10, Score 9. S0 is at (2, 8) and likely moves to (2, 9) or (3, 8).\nAfter T57, S1 will be at (4, 5).\nNext targets: A(5, 6) or A(0, 6) / A(3, 1).\nA(5, 6) is 1 step away (RIGHT to (5, 6)).\nIf S0 moves toward (1, 8) or (2, 9), A(0, 6) becomes contested/less accessible quickly.\nPost-apple move: S1 should aim RIGHT towards A(5, 6) next turn (T58).\n\nThe immediate move must be UP to secure the apple at (4, 5).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

S0 will be at one of {(2, 9), (1, 8), (3, 8)}. S1 should aim RIGHT toward (5, 6) next turn, unless S0's position severely restricts movement (e.g., if S0 moves to (3, 8) and S1 needs to move to (3, 5) to approach safely, or if A(0, 6) becomes critical). For now, focus on securing the immediate apple.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Your current state (Turn 60):\nHead: (5, 6)\nBody: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)] (Length 10, Apples 10. Wait, the last move rationale indicated S1 ate an apple and grew to length 11, but the current body list has length 10. I must follow the *current* state provided for Turn 60, which lists 10 body segments, meaning 11 total cells including the head. Let's re-verify the length from the T59 rationale: \"Score becomes 11.\" Length is Apple Count + 1 initial segment. Length should be 11. The provided body list for T60 has 9 segments, leading to a total length of 10. If the apple count is 10, the length must be 11. I will assume the body list provided is accurate for its components but that the length implied by the apple count (10 apples $\\implies$ length 11) is correct, meaning the head at (5, 6) plus 10 body segments. The provided T60 body list has 9 segments listed *after* the head coordinate, resulting in 10 total cells. This contradicts the T59 rationale where S1 ate (5, 6) and increased score to 11, implying length 11.\n\nLet's reconcile the T59 conclusion and T60 input:\nT59: S1 moved RIGHT to (5, 6), ate A(5, 6). Score became 11. Length should be 11.\nIf T59 resulted in Score 11, S1 should have $1 + 11 = 12$ cells total (1 head + 11 body).\nThe provided T60 state shows: Head (5, 6), 9 body segments listed. Total 10 cells. Apples 10.\n\n*Self-Correction based on Input Priority:* I must use the state given for Turn 60, even if the T59 rationale seems inconsistent with the resulting state's length/apple count.\n**Turn 60 State:** Head (5, 6). Body (9 segments). Score 10. Length 10.\nThis implies S1 *did not* eat an apple on T59, or the apple counter/body list is wrong. Given the prompt says \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 10,\" I proceed with Score 10, Length 10.\nThe T59 rationale must have predicted a move to (5, 6), but perhaps the game engine determined the move was blocked or the apple wasn't there, or the rationale itself was based on a bad assumption, resulting in the provided T60 state. The prompt shows the *result* of the move picked in the T59 rationale (which was RIGHT).\n\n**Re-evaluating T59 Move Result:**\nIf the move was RIGHT to (5, 6), and the resulting state shows Score 10 (no gain), it means S1 moved to (5, 6) but did not eat the apple A(5, 6). This is impossible if A(5, 6) was truly present on T59 and the move was legal.\n\nLet's assume the provided T60 state is the ground truth based on the previous turn's move (which was RIGHT).\nS1 Head: (5, 6).\nApples remaining: (0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0). (Note: A(5, 6) is missing, and A(0, 5) is present, which contradicts the T59 apple list, but matches the board visualization). I will rely solely on the provided Board state visualization and the head position (5, 6).\n\nBoard visualization analysis for T60:\nS1 Head at (5, 6).\nApples (A) at: (0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1), (4, 0). (Total 4, not 5 as listed). The listed apples are: (0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0).\nLet's trust the explicit Apple List: A: (0, 6), (9, 8), (3, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0).\n\nEnemy S0 Head: (0, 7).\n\n**Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (5, 6)**\nS1 Body Set (Self-collision avoidance): Head (5, 6). Tail segment is (8, 5). Body: \\{(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)\\}\n\n*   UP (5, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (5, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 6): Hits own body. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6): Safe.\n\nS1 Safe set: {(5, 7), (5, 5), (6, 6)}.\n\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Safe Moves from (0, 7)**\nS0 Body Set (excluding head): \\{(0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)\\}\n\n*   UP (0, 8): Hits own body (if (0, 8) is the segment directly behind (0, 7) - checking the board: (0, 8) is marked T, so this is a backward move check). Yes, (0, 8) is the segment behind (0, 7). **DEAD**.\n*   DOWN (0, 6): Apple A(0, 6) is here. Safe move otherwise.\n*   LEFT (-1, 7): Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (1, 7): Safe.\n\nS0 Safe set: {(0, 6), (1, 7)}.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate S1 Moves considering S0 predictions**\n\nAvailable Apples for S1 targeting: (9, 8), (3, 1), (0, 5), (4, 0). (A(0, 6) is targeted by S0).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 6)**: Safe. Moves away from the cluster of apples in the bottom left.\n*   **Move UP to (5, 7)**: Safe. Neutral move, sets up for a diagonal chase toward A(9, 8).\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 5)**: Safe. Keeps S1 central.\n\nS0 has two options: (0, 6) (eats apple) or (1, 7) (advances right).\n\n**Scenario 1: S1 moves R to (6, 6)**\nS1 @ (6, 6). S0 @ (0, 6) [Eats A(0, 6)] OR S0 @ (1, 7).\n\nIf S0 moves to (0, 6), it eats the apple and grows longer, increasing the threat level of its wall. If S0 moves to (1, 7), it advances towards S1's general area but doesn't eat an apple.\n\n**Scenario 2: S1 moves UP to (5, 7)**\nS1 @ (5, 7). S0 @ (0, 6) [Eats A(0, 6)] OR S0 @ (1, 7).\n\nThis move seems neutral regarding immediate gains, but slightly closer to the top apple A(9, 8).\n\n**Scenario 3: S1 moves DOWN to (5, 5)**\nS1 @ (5, 5). S0 @ (0, 6) [Eats A(0, 6)] OR S0 @ (1, 7).\n\nThis keeps S1 lower on the board, potentially positioning for A(3, 1) or A(4, 0) later, but S0 is currently closing in on the bottom left corner.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nS0 is positioned on the left side and can immediately claim A(0, 6) if it moves DOWN. S1 should try to prevent S0 from having a dominant path or should prioritize reaching a high-value apple. A(9, 8) is isolated and far. The remaining apples are scattered. S1 needs to maneuver towards the center/right away from S0's established wall on the left.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) distances S1 from S0's potentially expanding wall near the left edge (0,0 to 2,9). It allows S1 to start curving towards the top right or bottom right quadrants for the remaining apples.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6) and S0 moves to (1, 7):\nS1 is at (6, 6). S0 is at (1, 7). Next turn, S1 can move (6, 7) or (7, 6). S0 is likely moving towards the center.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6) and S0 moves to (0, 6) [Eating Apple]:\nS1 is at (6, 6). S0 is at (0, 6) and is now longer. S1 must maintain a strong position.\n\nGiven S0's restricted safe moves, it seems highly likely S0 will take A(0, 6) by moving DOWN to (0, 6) on T60. S1 should move away from that collision area and advance towards the center/right to claim space or the next closest apple (which is still somewhat distant). (6, 6) seems the most aggressive safe expansion move.\n\nLet's check for potential conflicts in T61 if S1 moves R=(6, 6) and S0 moves D=(0, 6).\nS1 @ (6, 6). Body tail ends at (8, 5).\nS0 @ (0, 6). Grown longer.\n\nS1 next moves from (6, 6): (7, 6), (6, 7), (5, 6) [backwards, dead].\nS0 next moves from (0, 6): (1, 6), (0, 7), (0, 5) [Apple].\n\nThis seems like a reasonable path to expand towards the middle of the board where S1 has more freedom than on the edges.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nPlan for T61: If S0 eats A(0, 6), S1 tries to move UP or RIGHT to claim space near the top or center, away from S0's expanding left boundary. If S0 moves to (1, 7), S1 should also consider moving toward the center top region (e.g., UP or R) to avoid being cut off.\n\nRIGHT",

I will rely on the **Board State Visualization** for apple locations, as the location of S0 is known relative to the board.\n\n**T61 Apples based on Board Visualization (A): (0, 6), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (9, 8).**\n\n**S1 Head (5, 6).

Wait, the movement direction for the tail is complex based on the input/output structure. The tail segment that just vacated its spot is the one S1 moves away from. If S1 moved RIGHT to (5, 6) on T60, the tail segment (8, 5) moved to (9, 5) assuming it was the tail, or it just moved off the board if S1 was Length 10 and ate nothing.\nSince S1 Score is 10, Length is 10 cells (1 head + 9 body segments).\n\nThe provided body list for T60 was: Head: (5, 6), Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)]. (9 segments). Last move was RIGHT.\n\nIf the move RIGHT resulted in the head moving from (4, 6) to (5, 6) (to maintain consistency with T59's configuration being near (4, 6) before T60), then the cell behind (5, 6) is (4, 6).\nLet's verify the T60 body list against the existing body segments listed *before* the T60 move. Since we don't have T59 state, we rely on the T60 state for current body hazards.\nS1 Head: (5, 6). Body segments: $B = \\{(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)\\}$.\nThe previous head position (which is now harmless to move into) is NOT specified, but the tail **must** be the one (8, 5) that appeared in the rationale/board layout inconsistency analysis if growth happened, or the last element of the current list if no growth happened.\n\nGiven: Head moves to (New H). Tail segment (Old T) is removed, unless an apple was eaten.\nThe previous move was RIGHT. If S1 was at (4, 6) on T59, and moved RIGHT, the new head is (5, 6).\nIf no apple was eaten (score 10), the tail (the last element of the T59 body list) should have been removed.\nThe T60 body list seems to be missing the T59 tail segment and does not include the segment vacated by the previous move.\n\nLet's assume the provided T60 body list **is complete and defines all collision points** for turn 61, and moving into the spot vacated by the previous move (the spot the head was on T60) is safe. The spot vacated by the tail is unknown but irrelevant for collision unless S1 is very long and wraps around. We only need to check the listed body segments $B$.\n\n*   UP (5, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (5, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 6): Hits body segment (4, 6). **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6): Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: {(5, 7), (5, 5), (6, 6)}.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Safe Moves from (0, 7)**\nS0 Head: (0, 7).

Sets up for (5, 8) or (6, 7) next turn. (9, 8) is 3 moves away.\n2.  **S1 moves DOWN to (5, 5)**: Moves centrally low. This is slightly closer to A(4, 0) and A(5, 0) than (5, 7) is, but S0 is reinforcing the left side, making the bottom left quadrant potentially more dangerous/crowded later.\n3.  **S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6)**: Pushing rightward, establishing control in the center-right region.\n\nS1 secured 10 apples, S0 secured 17. S0 is much longer (18 vs 10 cells). S1 needs to secure territory and try to eat apples quickly to catch up or survive.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6), it creates a strong central presence.\nS1 @ (6, 6). S0 @ (0, 6). S0 gained length.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (5, 7).\nS1 @ (5, 7). S0 @ (0, 6).\n\n(6, 6) feels slightly more aggressive in expanding horizontally toward open space rather than vertically into the already contested upper half. Expanding right keeps S1 away from the long S0 body running vertically down the left side (x=0 to x=2).\n\nLet's check potential collisions T62 if S1 moves R=(6, 6) and S0 moves D=(0, 6).\n\nS1 @ (6, 6). Safe moves next turn: (7, 6), (6, 7).\nS0 @ (0, 6). Safe moves next turn include (0, 5) which is now empty (if we disregard the listed apple list inconsistency and trust the board where (0, 5) is empty), or (1, 6). S0 likely moves to (1, 6) or up to (0, 7) (backwards).\n\nMoving RIGHT maintains maximum distance from S0's immediate expansion vector (DOWN/CENTER) and solidifies the middle ground.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Expand gradually right and up, aiming for A(9, 8) if S0 doesn't immediately secure the top right corner, or pivot down towards A(4, 0)/A(5, 0) once the center is secured. Avoid the left third of the board occupied by S0.\n\n**Final choice: RIGHT to (6, 6)**\n\nPlan Note: Move RIGHT to (6, 6) to establish presence in the center-right quadrant, away from S0's strong left-side presence. Assume S0 eats A(0, 6) and increases its length, reinforcing the left wall. Next turn, plan to move towards the upper central area ((6, 7) or (7, 6)) to open paths toward A(9, 8). Verify safety against any potential (1, 7) move by S0. If S0 moves to (1, 7), S1 at (6, 6) is still far enough away not to worry about immediate encroachment.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving back to (4, 6) is a collision.\n\n*   UP (5, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (5, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 6): Collision with $B_1$. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6): Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: {(5, 7), (5, 5), (6, 6)}.\n\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Move and check mutual collisions**\nS0 Head: (0, 7). S0 Body $B_0$ defined previously.\nS0's most likely move is DOWN to (0, 6) to eat A(0, 6). If S0 moves to (0, 6), it grows.\n\nWe must check if S0's predicted move (0, 6) collides with any of S1's potential next positions:\n*   If S1 moves UP to (5, 7): S0 moves to (0, 6). No collision.\n*   If S1 moves DOWN to (5, 5): S0 moves to (0, 6). No collision.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6): S0 moves to (0, 6). No collision.\n\nWe must also check for head-on collisions (S1 Head = S0 Head destination) or if S0 moves into S1's body.\nS0's other safe move was (1, 7).\n\nCase A: S0 moves D to (0, 6) (Most likely, eats apple)\nCase B: S0 moves R to (1, 7) (Less likely, leaves apple)\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options based on anticipated S0 growth (Case A: S0 moves to (0, 6))**\nS1 Goal: Secure apples (9, 8), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0). S0 controls the entire left edge.\n\n1.  **MOVE UP (5, 7)**: Moves toward A(9, 8). This is a 3-move path roughly (5,7)->(5,8)->(6,8)->(7,8)->(8,8)->(9,8) if S0 doesn't block. S0 is committed to the left side, so moving toward the upper right corner seems like a good priority.\n2.  **MOVE DOWN (5, 5)**: Moves towards A(4, 0) / A(5, 0). This is a 3-move path (5, 5) -> (5, 4) [body segment] -> collision if S1 grows. Wait, (5, 4) is S1's body. S1 cannot move (5, 5) -> (5, 4).\n    If S1 is at (5, 5), safe moves next turn are (5, 4) [Collision], (6, 5), (4, 5) [Collision]. Moving down quickly traps S1 near its own lower segments (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)... This risks confinement.\n3.  **MOVE RIGHT (6, 6)**: Continues broadening control across the middle. Keeps options open for pivoting up or down next turn. Slightly favors the central area over strict apple pursuit.\n\nComparing UP (5, 7) vs RIGHT (6, 6):\nMoving UP to (5, 7) immediately heads towards the nearest high-value apple A(9, 8). S0's growth on the left (0, 6) does not interfere with this path directly. This seems strategically superior to moving centrally (6, 6) which leaves A(9, 8) 4 turns away instead of 3. Because S0 is longer, denying S0 access to apples is paramount, and A(9, 8) is geographically furthest from S0.\n\nLet's confirm the path to A(9, 8) from (5, 7):\nT62: (5, 7)\nT63: Likely (5, 8) or (6, 7).\nT64: Continues progressing.\n\nIf S0 takes the apple at (0, 6), its length increases to 19, further cementing its dominance on the left flank. S1 needs to establish a path to the open right side.\n\nMOVE UP seems to be the best trajectory towards the most geographically isolated apple A(9, 8) while staying safe from S0's immediate expansion.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Prioritize movement towards A(9, 8) along the top edge (Y=7, Y=8, Y=9). If S0 tries to cut across the top (e.g., moving to (1, 7) next turn instead of eating), S1 can pivot towards the lower apples A(4, 0), A(5, 0). If S0 eats (0, 6), S1 continues upward trajectory.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My previous rationale indicated a move to (5, 6), but looking at the board state and current head position (7, 7), the *actual* previous move must have been UP from (7, 6).\nIf Head is (7, 7) now, and Body starts with (7, 6), the move was UP.\n\nLet's re-examine the previous move info provided, as it seems to conflict with my current state:\n**Your last move information:** ... **START LAST MOVE PICK** UP **END LAST MOVE PICK**\nThis suggests I chose UP last turn. If I chose UP, I moved from (7, 6) to (7, 7).\nMy body after *that* move (Turn 62) should have been:\nHead: (7, 7)\nBody: [(7, 6) -> was head, now new segment], [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]\nThe provided body list for Turn 63 is: Head: (7, 7), Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]. This confirms the head moved UP from (7, 6) last turn. The rationale provided for T62 used a head at (5, 6), suggesting the provided rationale might be from a *different* previous turn or based on an incorrect assumption about the board state at T62.\n\n**Strategy must be based on current state (Head @ (7, 7)) regardless of the provided rationale's specific starting point.**\n\n### Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (7, 7)\nHead: (7, 7). Previous segment: (7, 6).\nThe move immediately backwards is DOWN to (7, 6). Since (7, 6) is the segment directly behind the head, moving DOWN is an automatic collision (self-destruction).\n\nPossible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8)**: Safe board space. Not in $B_1$.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6)**: Collision with own body (self-kill). **DEAD**.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7)**: Safe board space. Not in $B_1$.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7)**: Safe board space. Not in $B_1$.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: {(7, 8), (6, 7), (8, 7)}.\n\n### Step 2: Predict S0 Move and check mutual collisions\nS0 Head: (0, 4). S0 Tail: (7, 1).\n\nS0 must be cautious as it is long (length 18) and its tail (7, 1) might move next, potentially clearing a path if it eats an apple. S0 has 18 apples; it is much larger.\n\nS0 Safe Moves from (0, 4):\nBoard boundaries: (0, 0) to (9, 9).\nS0 Body Set $B_0$: {(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1)}.\n\n*   UP (0, 5): In $B_0$. **DEAD**.\n*   DOWN (0, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (-1, 4): Off board. **DEAD**.\n*   RIGHT (1, 4): Safe.\n\nS0 Safe Moves: {(0, 3), (1, 4)}.\n\n**Prediction for S0:**\nS0 is on the far left edge, isolated from the apples except potentially A(3, 1) if it moves down aggressively.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (0, 3), it seems to be moving towards the lower apples A(3, 1), A(4, 0), A(5, 0), but it's a slow path.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it expands towards the center, potentially threatening my lower body structure later, but allows S0 to survive easily. Given its current pathing towards the left wall, moving (0, 3) seems slightly more aligned with keeping the body concentrated.\n\nLet's check collisions for S1's safe moves against S0's potential moves:\n\n**A. S0 moves DOWN to (0, 3)** (Maintaining wall hug)\n1. S1 UP (7, 8): No collision.\n2. S1 LEFT (6, 7): No collision.\n3. S1 RIGHT (8, 7): No collision.\n\n**B. S0 moves RIGHT to (1, 4)** (Expanding towards center)\n1. S1 UP (7, 8): No collision.\n2. S1 LEFT (6, 7): No collision.\n3. S1 RIGHT (8, 7): No collision.\n\nNo immediate mutual collision risk this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options based on Apple Location and Future Strategy\nMy head is at (7, 7). Available apples are far right/top right: (9, 8), (9, 9), and bottom: (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0).\n\nS0 is completely dominating the left side. I need to secure the right and top apples quickly before S0 tries to cut me off entirely or reaches 30 apples first (S0 has 18, I have 10).\n\nDesired path: Towards A(9, 8) or A(9, 9).\n\n1.  **MOVE UP (7, 8)**: Directly approaches A(9, 8) and A(9, 9).\n    Path to (9, 8): (7, 8) -> (7, 9) or (8, 8) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) or (9, 8). Excellent initial move towards the highest yielding corner.\n2.  **MOVE LEFT (6, 7)**: Moves somewhat centrally/horizontally. Stays away from the top apples, potentially allowing S0 to shift focus upwards if S0 decides to abandon the wall. Seems slow for the high-value apples.\n3.  **MOVE RIGHT (8, 7)**: Good progress towards (9, 8). (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8) or (9, 9). This is slightly better positioned than (7, 8) for moving towards (9, 8) in the next step, as it's already at X=8.\n\nComparing UP (7, 8) vs RIGHT (8, 7):\nIf I move UP to (7, 8): Next turn, I can move (8, 8) or (7, 9). (8, 8) is ideal for pursuing (9, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 7): Next turn, I can move (9, 7) (eating A(9, 8) might be possible with 2 moves) or (8, 8).\n\n(8, 7) seems slightly more direct toward (9, 8) which is currently the highest apple on the board that isn't A(9, 9) (which is adjacent to A(9, 8)).\n\nLet's analyze the path to A(9, 8) from (8, 7):\nT63: (8, 7)\nT64: Move RIGHT to (9, 7). If S0 moves slowly or centrally, I can eat A(9, 8) on T65 by moving UP to (9, 8) (assuming I don't move into S0's body if it expanded).\n\nLet's analyze the path to A(9, 8) from (7, 8):\nT63: (7, 8)\nT64: Move RIGHT to (8, 8).\nT65: Move RIGHT to (9, 8) or UP to (8, 9).\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP achieve similar proximity in 2 moves to the target area. However, UP (7, 8) moves me higher on the board generally, which is also good for securing A(9, 9). (8, 7) keeps me slightly lower but closer to the X coordinate of the target apple.\n\nGiven S0 is moving slowly or centrally downwards/sideways from its corner, grabbing the high corner apples first is crucial. UP is generally favored in these situations unless RIGHT provides an unambiguous shortcut. They seem roughly equivalent in speed to the key target (9, 8). I will prioritize vertical progress towards the topmost apples, especially A(9, 9). UP seems marginally safer as moving right might push me too close to the edge if I miscalculate the body clearance required for eating.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Priority is securing the top right apples (9, 8) and (9, 9). Followed by pathing towards the lower apples (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0). Avoid confrontation with S0 unless it offers an opportunity to eliminate a large snake structure. Stick to UP/RIGHT movement pattern initially.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Prioritize securing A(9, 8) and A(9, 9) by moving UP/RIGHT towards the upper right corner. If S0 shows any signs of moving across the top half of the board, immediately pivot down towards the bottom apples.\n\nI choose UP to start the ascent towards the top apples.\n\nUP",

S1 RIGHT (8, 7) -> Safe.\n\nNo immediate mutual collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options based on Apple Location\nMy goal is the top right apples: (9, 8) or (9, 9).\n\n1.  **MOVE UP (7, 8)**: Moves closer to the top edge.\n    *   If S0 moves (0, 2) or (1, 3), both keep S0 far away.\n    *   This continues the upward trajectory established last turn, targeting the high-value apples.\n2.  **MOVE RIGHT (8, 7)**: Moves directly towards X=9.\n    *   If S0 moves (0, 2) or (1, 3), both keep S0 far away.\n    *   This sets up (9, 7) next turn.\n3.  **MOVE LEFT (6, 7)**: Moves away from apples, centralizing. Not optimal.\n\nComparing UP (7, 8) and RIGHT (8, 7) again:\nUP (7, 8) sets up: (7, 9) or (8, 8) next turn.\nRIGHT (8, 7) sets up: (9, 7) or (8, 8) next turn.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 7), my next target cell (9, 7) is adjacent to A(9, 8). If S0 moves (1, 3), it's still far. If I move RIGHT, I position myself for an immediate attack on A(9, 8) on turn 65 by moving UP to (9, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 7). Wait, (8, 7) -> (9, 7) (RIGHT) or (8, 8) (UP).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (8, 7):\nT65 potential moves:\n1. RIGHT -> (9, 7). This traps me against the boundary if I go UP next, but gets me closer to A(9, 8).\n2. UP -> (8, 8). This looks like a much better setup for accessing both (9, 8) and (9, 9) quickly.\n\nIf I move UP (7, 8):\nT65 potential moves:\n1. RIGHT -> (8, 8). Same as above.\n2. UP -> (7, 9). Also very good, moving along the top edge.\n\nSince both UP and RIGHT lead to (8, 8) in the optimal sequence, I prefer UP, as it keeps me slightly more central on the Y-axis for potential turns towards the lower apples if S0 suddenly makes a move towards the top half of the board. Given S0's current position on the bottom-left, UP is slightly safer pathing for the top-right cluster.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue driving towards A(9, 8) and A(9, 9) using iterative UP and RIGHT moves. Monitor S0 closely; if S0 deviates significantly from the bottom/left, prepare to switch focus to the lower apples (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0). Remain mindful of the tail growth (my own tail is at (8, 4) and will move forward if I don't eat).\n\nUP",

Apples of interest: A(9, 8), A(9, 9).\n\n1.  **MOVE LEFT (6, 9)**: Moves parallel to the top edge, away from the most immediate apples (9, 8) and (9, 9).

Move RIGHT to secure the highest coordinate apple (9, 9) next turn.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 9) (Turn 65), and S0 makes any safe move:\n*   If S0 moves (0, 2): S1 can move RIGHT to (9, 9) next turn (Turn 66), eating A(9, 9).\n*   If S0 moves (1, 3): S1 can move RIGHT to (9, 9) next turn (Turn 66), eating A(9, 9).\n\nThe path seems clear and safe.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move RIGHT towards (9, 9). Immediately after securing (9, 9), pivot to (9, 8). Monitor S0 to ensure it doesn't try to cut across the middle of the board unexpectedly, although its current pathing keeps it very far away. Prioritize eating apples over aggressive cutting manoeuvres as long as the path is clear.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT (9, 9) - **This is an apple (A(9, 9))**.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (8, 8), RIGHT (9, 9 - Apple).\n\n### Step 2: Predict S0 Move and check mutual collisions\nS0 Head: (0, 1). Previous segment: (0, 2).\nS0 Body Set $B_0$: {(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)}.\nS0 Possible moves from (0, 1): UP (0, 2 - Self collision), RIGHT (1, 1).\nS0 Safe Move Set: $S0_{safe} = \\{(1, 1)\\}$. (It cannot move UP because (0, 2) is part of its body).\n\n**Collision Check with S1 Moves:**\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 8), (9, 9)\\}$.\nS0 will move to (1, 1).\n\n1. S1 DOWN (8, 8): Safe from S0.\n2. S1 RIGHT (9, 9): Safe from S0.\n\nNo mutual collisions are possible as S0 is far away in the bottom left and S1 is in the top right.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options based on Apple Location\nCurrent Head: (8, 9). Apples of interest: A(9, 9) (target), A(9, 8).\n\n1.  **MOVE RIGHT (9, 9)**: Eats A(9, 9). This secures the top-rightmost apple and increases length. My head will be at (9, 9). On the next turn, I can target A(9, 8) by moving DOWN to (9, 8). This looks like the optimal greedy move path.\n2.  **MOVE DOWN (8, 8)**: Moves away from the immediate apples (9, 9) and (9, 8). This is a non-greedy move and risks letting S0 gain ground or S1 missing the chance to secure the corner efficiently.\n\nThe plan laid out in the rationale for Turn 65 was to move RIGHT to (8, 9) so that on Turn 66, I could move RIGHT again to (9, 9) and eat the apple. I am now at (8, 9) and RIGHT leads to (9, 9), which is the apple.\n\nThis is clearly the best move. I eat A(9, 9). Score increases to 11. Length increases.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat A(9, 9) now. Next turn, plan to move DOWN to (9, 8) to eat the last apple in that corner. Then pivot inwards towards the remaining apples (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0). I must continue monitoring S0, which is currently moving towards the center-bottom area (1, 1).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**",

Since an apple was eaten, the tail did not shrink, resulting in a longer body list than implied by the structure of the last move rationale (which assumed no apple was eaten for body calculation purposes, but the resulting state shows it must have been eaten).\n\n**My current status (Turn 67):**\nHead: (9, 9).\nBody: Since I ate an apple, my length increased.\nPrevious body (Turn 66 start): [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)] (11 segments)\nIf I ate an apple, my new body should have 12 segments.\nNew Body (inferred from board position): [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)] - Wait, the body list provided for Turn 67 is:\nBody: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)] (11 segments).\nThis suggests the board state provided *is the state before eating* OR that the board shows the result *after* a move, but the body list provided *does not* reflect the growth from eating the apple at (9, 9) on Turn 66.\n\nLet's rely on the explicit state provided for Turn 67:\nHead: (9, 9). Apples: 11.\nBody: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)] (11 segments).\nThe tail is (5, 4). If the prior move (Right to (9, 9)) ate an apple, the tail should have stayed put, making the length 12. If it didn't eat, the tail (5, 4) should have moved out, making the length 10.\nThe board shows a snake of length 12 segments including the head at (9, 9) if we count from the board description (T's + 1):\n(9,9) H, (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4). This is 12 segments shown on the board if T means body segment.\n\nLet's assume the provided Head position (9, 9) and Apple count (11) are correct, and that because the previous move was greedy/apple-focused, the body list provided for T67 *must* reflect the structure *resulting* from eating that apple, even if segment count is off by one compared to my inference about the tail movement. The crucial point is that (9, 9) is my head, and I just ate.\n\n**Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (9, 9)**\nHead: (9, 9). Previous segment (if no apple eaten): (8, 9). If apple eaten, (8, 9) is the segment immediately behind the new head. In growth state, we check collision against the body excluding the intended tail position.\nBody Set $B_1$: {(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)}. (Length 11)\nTail (if no growth): (5, 4). If growth occurred, (5, 4) remains the tail.\n\nNeighbors of (9, 9):\n1. UP (9, 10) - Off board.\n2. DOWN (9, 8) - **Apple A(9, 8)**. Safe from body collision.\n3. LEFT (8, 9) - Self collision (part of $B_1$).\n4. RIGHT (10, 9) - Off board.\n\nSafe Moves (preliminary): DOWN (9, 8).\n\n**Step 2: Predict S0 Move and check mutual collisions**\nS0 Head: (1, 1). S0 Body Set $B_0$: Segments up through (4, 2). Tail is (5, 2) based on board/previous turn data, or potentially (4, 2) if it shrunk last turn based on (5, 2) being the tail on T66. Let's use the provided board state body for S0:\nBody: [(0, 1), (0, 2), ..., (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)]. Head (1, 1) is NOT safe moving to (0, 1) (previous head spot).\nS0 Neighbors of (1, 1):\n1. UP (1, 2) - Safe.\n2. DOWN (1, 0) - Safe (Board corner).\n3. LEFT (0, 1) - Self collision (part of $B_0$).\n4. RIGHT (2, 1) - Safe.\nS0 Safe Moves: $S0_{safe} = \\{(1, 2), (1, 0), (2, 1)\\}$. S0 is highly flexible.\n\n**Collision Check with S1 Move (DOWN to (9, 8) - Apple)**\nS1 Move: (9, 8).\nS0 moves to one of its safe spots. Since S0 is far away in the bottom left, this move is safe from S0 head collision, and S0 cannot move onto (9, 8) regardless.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options**\nThe only immediate safe move that targets an apple is **DOWN (9, 8)**.\nThis will result in eating the second apple in the top right corner, bringing my score to 12 and increasing my length again.\nThe resulting position (9, 8) allows me to pivot: I can move LEFT to (8, 8) next turn, or potentially DOWN to (9, 7) or (8, 7) if the board state allows. Moving LEFT seems like a good path to clear the top edge, or I can traverse down the right edge towards the remaining apples (8, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1).\n\nStrategy Note: Secure the remaining corner apple (9, 8). Then, move towards the remaining cluster of apples (8, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1). Snake #0 is currently relatively low and centralized, giving me space in the top right to maneuver.\n\n**Move Decision:** DOWN to eat A(9, 8).\n\nDOWN",

(5, 4), and the tail remains (5, 4).\n$B_1 = \\{(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)\\}$.

RIGHT (10, 8) - Off board.\n\nS1 Potential Moves: DOWN (9, 7), LEFT (8, 8).\n\n**Step 2: Check S0 Movement Prediction**\nS0 Head: (2, 1).\nS0 Neighbors of (2, 1):\n1. UP (2, 2) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n2. DOWN (2, 0) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (1, 1) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n4. RIGHT (3, 1) - **Apple A(3, 1)**.\n\nS0 Safe Moves: $S0_{safe} = \\{(2, 0), (3, 1)\\}$. S0 has two options, one leading to an apple.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate S1 Options against S0**\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (8, 8)**\nCollision check with S0 moves:\n1. If S0 moves to (2, 0): Safe.\n2. If S0 moves to (3, 1) (eats apple A(3, 1)): Safe.\n(8, 8) is far from S0, so no collision possible.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (9, 7)**\nCollision check with S0 moves:\n1. If S0 moves to (2, 0): Safe.\n2. If S0 moves to (3, 1) (eats apple A(3, 1)): Safe.\n\n**Step 4: Comparison**\nBoth moves are safe from immediate death and S0 collision. We compare apple proximity.\n\nRemaining Apples: (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 0). Note: If S0 moves to (3, 1), that apple is gone.\n\n*   **If we choose LEFT to (8, 8):**\n    *   If S0 moves to (3, 1) (Apple eaten by S0, Score 18 -> 19): We are positioned to move towards (8, 0) next turn by moving (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6) eventually, or pivot towards the bottom edge. (8, 8) keeps us high up.\n    *   If S0 moves to (2, 0) (Apple remains): We can aim for (3, 1) next turn if S0 doesn't block.\n\n*   **If we choose DOWN to (9, 7):**\n    *   This places us on the right edge, aiming downwards towards (8, 0). (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) ... This puts us on a path towards A(8, 0) relative to that edge.\n    *   If S0 moves to (3, 1): We secure a path along the right edge, while S0 gets an apple.\n\nS0 has a very tempting move: eating A(3, 1) by moving RIGHT to (3, 1). If S0 takes this, the remaining apples cluster is (4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 0). These are all on the bottom edge.\n\nSince S0 is likely to take (3, 1), we should position ourselves optimally to grab the remaining bottom apples or try to cut off S0 if possible. S0 is currently far down and looping in the corner.\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 8) seems slightly better positioned for the next move (8, 7) or (8, 6) which prepares a downward trajectory towards (8, 0), compared to (9, 7) which keeps us hugging the vertical wall slightly longer. (8, 8) allows a smoother diagonal approach to the bottom right corner resources.\n\nStrategy Note: Since S0 will likely eat A(3, 1) (moving RIGHT to (3, 1)), we focus on claiming the three remaining apples clustered on the bottom row: (4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 0). Moving LEFT to (8, 8) positions the head better for a series of moves down the right side/middle board towards (8, 0) without crossing S0's current area drastically.\n\nLEFT\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN (T69):** If we land safely at (8, 8), we plan to move LEFT or DOWN depending on S0's outcome. If S0 took (3, 1), we aim for (8, 7) next to start coming down toward (8, 0). If S0 moved to (2, 0), we aim for (3, 1) to claim that apple before S0 circles back. Given S0 behavior usually prioritizes apples, RIGHT to (3, 1) is the expectation. Therefore, plan to move (8, 7) next turn aiming for (8, 0).\n\nLEFT",

The head moved from (9, 8) to (8, 8).\n$B_1$ (Head to Tail): [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\nTail position (for backward collision check): (4, 5). (If we don't eat, the tail moves from (4, 4) to (3, 4)\u2014wait, the previous rationale stated the body ended with (5, 4) being the tail segment which absorbed the segment before it to grow to length 12. If the move was LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8), and NO apple was eaten, the tail (5, 4) is now gone, and the new tail is (4, 4)).\nLet's re-verify the body state from T68 rationale:\nBody length 12. Head (9, 8). Previous tail was (5, 4). Move LEFT means (5, 4) leaves, and the new tail is (4, 4).\nT68 move was LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8).\nNew Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]. The segment at (4, 4) moved to (4, 5). The segment at (5, 4) that was *before* the tail in the T67 state is now the tail candidate at (4, 4) if no apple was eaten.\n\nLooking at the provided current board state:\nS1 (Head at (8, 8)):\n9 . . . . . . . T T T\n8 T T T . . . . T 1 T  <-- (8, 8) is 1\n7 T . T . . . . T . .\n...\n4 T . T . T . . . . .  <-- (4, 4) exists in the body list from T68 rationale above, if the snake was growing.\n\nThe board state provided for T69 shows:\nMy Head (1) at (8, 8).\nNeighbors of (8, 8):\n1. UP (8, 9) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 7) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (7, 8) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n4. RIGHT (9, 8) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n\nWait, my analysis of the body configuration based on the T68 rationale appears to conflict with the explicitly provided board state for T69. I must trust the T69 board state provided:\nS1 Body segments visible near head: (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)...\nIf Head is (8, 8), it cannot move UP to (8, 9) if (8, 9) is occupied by its body. The board shows T at (8, 9).\nThe provided snake body list in the T69 prompt confirms this: Body: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\nHead H=(8, 8).\nH + UP -> (8, 9). (8, 9) is the 3rd segment of the body (T). $\\rightarrow$ **Fatal Collision if UP.**\nH + LEFT -> (7, 8). (7, 8) is the 5th segment of the body (T). $\\rightarrow$ **Fatal Collision if LEFT.**\nH + RIGHT -> (9, 8). (9, 8) is the 1st segment of the body (T). $\\rightarrow$ **Fatal Collision if RIGHT.**\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN to (8, 7). If the snake didn't eat an apple on Turn 68, the tail at (4, 4) would move to (3, 4) (or wherever the segment before it was if it grew). Since the body list is explicitly given, we check the tail location for backward collision if we move DOWN to (8, 7).\nTail is (4, 4). Moving DOWN to (8, 7) does not put me into the tail position.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: DOWN (8, 7).\n\n**Step 2: Check S0 Movement Prediction**\nS0 Head: (3, 1).\nApples remaining: (4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 0), (9, 1), (5, 3). Crucially, A(3, 1) is no longer listed in the T69 apple list, implying Snake #0 ate it on T68 (moving R from (2, 1) to (3, 1)).\nS0 Score: 19. This confirms S0 ate A(3, 1) last turn.\n\nS0 Neighbors of (3, 1):\n1. UP (3, 2) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n2. DOWN (3, 0) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (2, 1) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n4. RIGHT (4, 1) - Safe.\n\nS0 Safe Moves: $S0_{safe} = \\{(3, 0), (4, 1)\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate S1 Option (DOWN to (8, 7)) against S0**\nMove: DOWN to (8, 7).\nCollision check with S0 moves:\n1. If S0 moves to (3, 0): Safe. (8, 7) is far from (3, 0).\n2. If S0 moves to (4, 1): Safe. (8, 7) is far from (4, 1).\n\n**Step 4: Apple Proximity**\nWe are at (8, 8). We moved DOWN to (8, 7). (No apple eaten).\nRemaining apples: (4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 0), (9, 1), (5, 3).\n\nThe closest apple is A(8, 0) (distance 7).\nIf S0 moves to (4, 1), it is heading slightly towards the central cluster (5, 3), or potentially cutting off the bottom row later if it moves aggressively toward (8, 0). If S0 moves to (3, 0), it continues staying low.\n\nMoving (8, 7) places us directly on the path towards A(8, 0) (via (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)). This seems like the best path towards claiming the isolated apple on the right side, which is slightly less contested than the cluster at (4, 0), (5, 0).\n\nSince all other options led to immediate death, DOWN is the only choice.\n\nLong-term Plan: Continue heading down the right edge towards A(8, 0). If S0 does not block the bottom row path, we can collect (8, 0), then pivot towards (5, 0) and (4, 0). We must also monitor A(5, 3) which is somewhat isolated.\n\nDOWN",

Body $B_1$ (excluding head): [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)].\nTail position (if no apple eaten last turn): The body length is 12. If no apple was eaten on T69, the tail segment (4, 5) moves to fill the space previously occupied by (4, 4) which is not in $B_1$. Since the previous rationale confirmed DOWN was the only safe move, we assume no apple was eaten, and the effective tail for backward collision avoidance is the position before the move: (4, 5) moved to (4, 6), (4, 6) moved to (4, 5). Let's use the given body list for fatal collisions and check the tail movement rule. Since the body provided is 12 long, the movement means the true tail leaves its spot. The spot occupied by the tail $T_{old}$ after the move is the segment preceding the new tail $T_{new}$.\n$B_1$ (new): [(8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\nThe old tail position was (4, 5). If no apple was eaten, any move to (4, 5) is safe unless it is the position the segment *before* the old tail just vacated $T_{new}$. We must check safety against the existing body $B_1$.\n\nNeighbors of (8, 7):\n1. UP (8, 8) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 6) - Safe. (No body segment here).\n3. LEFT (7, 7) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n4. RIGHT (9, 7) - Safe. (No body segment or apple here).\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 6), (9, 7)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate S1 moves against S0 Prediction**\nEnemy Head $H_0 = (3, 0)$.\nS0 Body $B_0$ is long, spanning columns 0, 1, 2 extensively.\nThe move from T69 was DOWN to (3, 0). S0 did not eat an apple last turn, so its tail moved out of (3, 2) (if it was there) or (4, 0) area. Looking at the board, (3, 0) is the head of S0, and A(4, 0) and A(5, 0) are close.\n\nS0 Neighbors of (3, 0):\n1. UP (3, 1) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n2. DOWN (3, -1) - Off board. **S0 will not move DOWN.**\n3. LEFT (2, 0) - Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 0) - Apple location A(4, 0). This is a possibility if S0 is targeting this apple.\n\nS0 Safe Moves $S0_{safe}$ must be determined assuming S0 plays rationally to eat an apple or survive.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (2, 0): Safe move.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0) (eating A(4, 0)): Safe move, S0 grows.\nIf S0 moves UP to (3, 1): Fatal collision with $B_0$.\n\nIf S0 targets A(4, 0): $H_0' = (4, 0)$.\nIf S0 targets A(5, 0): S0 would need to move Right (4, 0), then Right again (5, 0).\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (2, 0): $H_0' = (2, 0)$.\n\nWe must ensure our move does not land on $H_0'$ NOR land on any cell S0 is currently blocking if S0 is forced into an unfavorable position. Since S0 has at least two rational options ((2, 0) or (4, 0)), we check both.\n\nCase A: S1 moves DOWN to (8, 6).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(4, 0)$: (8, 6) is safe.\nIf $H_0'=(2, 0)$: (8, 6) is safe.\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\nCase B: S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 7).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(4, 0)$: (9, 7) is safe.\nIf $H_0'=(2, 0)$: (9, 7) is safe.\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\n**Step 3: Apple Proximity and Strategy**\nWe are at (8, 7). We have two safe options: (8, 6) [DOWN] or (9, 7) [RIGHT].\n\nTarget Apples remaining: A(4, 0), A(5, 0), A(8, 0), A(9, 1), A(5, 3).\n\nOption DOWN to (8, 6): Moves us closer to A(8, 0) (distance 6). This continues the strategy from the previous turn of moving towards A(8, 0) along the right edge.\nOption RIGHT to (9, 7): Moves us towards A(9, 1) (distance 2). This is the closest apple.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 7):\n1. We eat A(9, 1) next turn if S0 doesn't interfere with the path to (9, 1) from (3, 0) or (4, 0).\n2. S0 is currently at (3, 0). If S0 moves to (4, 0), it controls the bottom row path along $y=0$. If S0 moves to (2, 0), it stays away from our right-side approach. Moving to (9, 7) seems faster towards an apple.\n\nLet's re-examine S0's options when targeting the bottom row apples (4, 0) and (5, 0).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0) (eating A(4, 0)), it leads A(5, 0). Then S1 has to contest (5, 0) or go for the middle/top apples. (S0 Score 20).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (2, 0), it stays far left.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 7):\nNext turn, H1=(9, 7). Target A(9, 1) is UP 2 steps away: (9, 8) [blocked by self body] or (9, 6) then (9, 5)... Wait, A(9, 1) is 2 steps down in y, but our head is at y=7.\nH1=(9, 7). A(9, 1) is 6 moves away (DOWN).\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 7) is generally moving along the boundary, which is usually safe, but it doesn't immediately put us on an apple path better than DOWN towards (8, 0).\n\nDistance to A(8, 0):\nFrom (8, 7): DOWN to (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0). 6 moves.\n\nDistance to A(9, 1):\nFrom (8, 7): RIGHT to (9, 7) [1 move]. Then DOWN to (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1) [6 moves]. Total 7 moves, assuming no blocks.\n\nThe move DOWN retains the vertical alignment towards A(8, 0) which was the established path, avoiding immediately cornering towards the upper right side where we have less room. Since there is no immediate threat or much closer apple by going RIGHT, continuing the path towards (8, 0) seems slightly safer for minimizing body constraints in the long run, as it keeps the right flank open.\n\nLet's stick to **DOWN** to (8, 6) to maintain the pursuit of A(8, 0).\n\nLong-term Plan: Continue moving DOWN towards A(8, 0). If S0 focuses hard on the bottom left apples A(4, 0), A(5, 0), this path isolates A(8, 0) for us. We must be mindful of S0 cutting us off below if they choose to move LEFT towards lower Y coordinates.\n\nDOWN",

If no apple was eaten, the cell (4, 5) is now safe.\n\nNeighbors of (8, 6):\n1. UP (8, 7) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 5) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (7, 6) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n4. RIGHT (9, 6) - Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 5), (9, 6)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate S1 moves against S0 Prediction**\nEnemy Head $H_0 = (4, 0)$. S0 ate A(4, 0) last turn, so its length increased, and its tail segment (3, 0) moved out of position.\nS0 Body $B_0$: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. Length 21. The old tail segment that moved was likely (3, 2) if S0 went (3, 0) -> (4, 0), meaning (3, 2) is now safe, or the segment before it. Based on the list provided in the last turn, the body was 20 long, ending in (2, 2). If S0 ate, the new tail is (2, 2) and whatever was before it moved up. The spot vacated by the tail *before* this move is now safe. We rely on checking against the provided list $B_0$.\n\nS0 Neighbors of (4, 0):\n1. UP (4, 1) - Safe.\n2. DOWN (4, -1) - Off board. **S0 will not move DOWN.**\n3. LEFT (3, 0) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n4. RIGHT (5, 0) - Apple location A(5, 0). This is S0's primary target.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 0) (eating A(5, 0)): $H_0' = (5, 0)$.\nIf S0 moves UP to (4, 1): $H_0' = (4, 1)$.\n\nCase A: S1 moves DOWN to (8, 5).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(5, 0)$: (8, 5) is safe (far away).\nIf $H_0'=(4, 1)$: (8, 5) is safe (far away).\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\nCase B: S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 6).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(5, 0)$: (9, 6) is safe (far away).\nIf $H_0'=(4, 1)$: (9, 6) is safe (far away).\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\n**Step 3: Apple Proximity and Strategy**\nWe are at (8, 6). Safe moves are (8, 5) [DOWN] or (9, 6) [RIGHT].\n\nTarget Apples remaining: A(5, 0), A(8, 0), A(9, 1), A(5, 3), A(0, 0).\n\nS0 is extremely focused on the bottom row (A(5, 0) is next). If S0 takes A(5, 0), it moves to (5, 0), and will likely turn upwards or continue right/left along the boundary.\n\nOption DOWN to (8, 5): Continues moving towards A(8, 0) (distance 5). This keeps us aligned on the right edge, away from S0's current concentration at the bottom left.\nOption RIGHT to (9, 6): Moves us towards potentially eating A(9, 1) faster (distance 4: to (9, 6) then (9, 5) ... (9, 1)).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 6):\nT+1 Head at (9, 6). Target A(9, 1) requires 5 more moves down.\nIf S0 moves to (5, 0), score 21. If S0 then proceeds to (6, 0), (7, 0), etc., they might surround the area.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 5):\nT+1 Head at (8, 5). Target A(8, 0) requires 5 more moves down. This path is very direct and keeps us away from the dense S0 region.\n\nSince S0 is highly likely to take A(5, 0) next and secure the bottom, our best strategy is to maintain a path towards the isolated A(8, 0) or A(9, 1). Both require a similar amount of linear movement from the current position if we choose RIGHT vs DOWN.\n\nThe crucial difference between (8, 5) and (9, 6) is which boundary we hug. Hugging the right wall (moving RIGHT) might lead to a quicker apple (if A(9, 1) is prioritized), but extending down the side (moving DOWN) keeps space open above us (y=7, 8, 9 are relatively open except for our body). Given the existing body structure hugging the right wall (x=9) might restrict future options more severely than moving slightly inwards towards x=8.\n\nI favor continuing the path towards A(8, 0) via DOWN, as this maintains a strategic distance from S0 and keeps our movement trajectory linear and predictable towards a known target.\n\nLong-term Plan: Continue moving DOWN towards A(8, 0) until we reach y=1 or y=0. Monitor S0 movements carefully to ensure we don't get cut off from the center or left side if we need to shift targets (like A(5, 3) or A(0, 0)).\n\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Self-Correction/Final Check on move:**\nH1=(8, 6).\nMove DOWN to (8, 5).\nS0 likely moves RIGHT to (5, 0), eating A(5, 0). H0=(5, 0).\nNo collision. Move seems safe and strategic continuation.\n\nDOWN",

This is S0's primary target.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (5, 0) (eating A(5, 0)): $H_0' = (5, 0)$.\nIf S0 moves UP to (4, 1): $H_0' = (4, 1)$.\n\nCase A: S1 moves DOWN to (8, 5).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(5, 0)$: (8, 5) is safe (far away).\nIf $H_0'=(4, 1)$: (8, 5) is safe (far away).\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\nCase B: S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 6).\nCollision check with potential $H_0'$:\nIf $H_0'=(5, 0)$: (9, 6) is safe (far away).\nIf $H_0'=(4, 1)$: (9, 6) is safe (far away).\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\n**Step 3: Apple Proximity and Strategy**\nWe are at (8, 6). Safe moves are (8, 5) [DOWN] or (9, 6) [RIGHT].\n\nTarget Apples remaining: A(5, 0), A(8, 0), A(9, 1), A(5, 3), A(0, 0).\n\nS0 is extremely likely to take A(5, 0) next and secure the bottom. If S0 takes (5, 0), its score becomes 22.\n\nIf we choose DOWN to (8, 5), we are aiming for A(8, 0). This requires 5 more steps down.\nIf we choose RIGHT to (9, 6), we are closer to A(9, 1), requiring 5 steps (e.g., (9,6)->(9,5)->(9,4)->(9,3)->(9,2)->(9,1)).\n\nBoth paths require roughly the same number of moves (5 moves) to reach the next closest apple on the boundary. Since the previous move was DOWN (moving into (8, 5) territory), following through with DOWN maintains consistency and keeps us slightly more central (x=8 vs x=9), potentially offering better escape routes if required later. If we hit A(8, 0) on T77, we are score 13, and S0 will likely be around y=3 or y=4 if they continued moving up from y=0.\n\nLong-term Plan: Continue moving DOWN towards A(8, 0) to lock in the next boundary apple while S0 is occupied near the bottom boundary. This ensures a steady collection rate away from the immediate conflict zone.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (8, 5)**\nHead $H_1 = (8, 5)$. New Body $B_1$ (after moving to (8, 5)): [(8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Tail (4, 6) vacated, (4, 5) is now safe.\n\nNeighbors of (8, 5):\n1. UP (8, 6) - Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 4) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (7, 5) - Safe.\n4. RIGHT (9, 5) - Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 4), (7, 5), (9, 5)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate S1 moves against S0 Prediction**\nWe assume S0 moved RIGHT to (5, 0) last turn, eating A(5, 0). $H_0 = (5, 0)$. Score 22.\nS0 Body $B_0$ (will shift its tail one segment further if it ate): Tail is now some segment before (2, 2) in the previous body list, or (2, 2) if it was the tail that moved out. We must predict S0's move from (5, 0).\n\nS0 Neighbors of (5, 0):\n1. UP (5, 1) - Safe based on existing map, but needs collision check with S1.\n2. DOWN (5, -1) - Off board.\n3. LEFT (4, 0) - Self collision ($B_0$).\n4. RIGHT (6, 0) - Safe, moving away from center mass.\n\nS0 Likely Moves: (5, 1) or (6, 0). S0 is likely continuing along the bottom edge of the board to collect A(8, 0) (which we are targeting) or moving up. A(8, 0) is currently reachable by S0 in 3 moves (5,0)->(6,0)->(7,0)->(8,0).\n\nCase A: S1 moves DOWN to (8, 4).\nIf $H_0'=(5, 1)$: (8, 4) is safe.\nIf $H_0'=(6, 0)$: (8, 4) is safe.\nNo collision. We are moving towards A(8, 0).\n\nCase B: S1 moves LEFT to (7, 5).\nIf $H_0'=(5, 1)$: (7, 5) is safe.\nIf $H_0'=(6, 0)$: (7, 5) is safe.\nNo collision. This move shifts us towards the center mass where A(5, 3) is located, but it moves us away from A(8, 0).\n\nCase C: S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5).\nIf $H_0'=(5, 1)$: (9, 5) is safe.\nIf $H_0'=(6, 0)$: (9, 5) is safe.\nNo collision. This aligns us towards A(9, 1) if we decide to pivot later.\n\n**Step 3: Apple Proximity and Strategy**\nCurrent Target: A(8, 0). Distance is 4 moves via DOWN path: (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0) (5 moves total).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 4), we are exactly on track.\nIf we move LEFT or RIGHT, we delay reaching A(8, 0) by at least 2 turns deviation compared to just taking the necessary right turn to get to (9, 5) and then moving down from there if we aim for A(9, 1).\n\nSince S0 is now at (5, 0), they are also moving towards A(8, 0) along the bottom edge if they choose (6, 0). If S0 moves to (6, 0), they are 3 moves behind us to A(8, 0). We must secure A(8, 0) before S0 does.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 4) is the most direct route to the next apple on our primary trajectory. This preserves the strategy developed last turn.\n\nLong-term Plan: Continue downward path towards A(8, 0). Once A(8, 0) is collected, re-evaluate: A(9, 1) is then 1 step away, or A(5, 3) becomes a primary target if S0 shifts its attention elsewhere. Given the board disparity (S0 has 21 apples, we have 12), focusing purely on collecting apples directly is paramount now.\n\nDOWN",

Last move was DOWN, moving from (8, 5) to (8, 4) in the previous turn's analysis (though the provided last move section states the move was DOWN from (8, 5) resulting in (8, 4) in that setup, the current state shows Head (8, 3) and the body indicates a move sequence ending at (8, 3)).\n\nLet's re-establish the current state based on Turn 74 information:\nHead $H_1 = (8, 3)$.\nBody $B_1$: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]. Length 13. Tail is (7, 6). It seems turn 73 resulted in the head moving to (8, 3) from (8, 4), and the new tail is (7, 6) if the old tail was (7, 7). Wait, the body list implies the tail is (7, 6). The snake gained length last turn, or the provided body list truncated the old tail cell. Given the previous analysis showed S1 at (8, 5) on T73, and the move chosen was DOWN, the head moved to (8, 4). If that move gained an apple, the length increased. If it didn't gain an apple, the tail moved from (4, 6) to (7, 6) which is impossible in one step.\n\nLet's assume the provided current state for Turn 74 reflects the result of the DOWN move from (8, 5) in Turn 73, and no apple was collected, meaning the tail (4, 6) moved out, leaving the current tail at (5, 6) or the body list provided is absolute.\n$H_1 = (8, 3)$.\n$B_1 = [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]$. Length 12. The tail is (7, 6). If this is Turn 74, and the snake didn't eat on T73, the previous tail (4, 6) should be gone, and the new tail should be (5, 6) if the previous body was indeed long before T73.\nIf S1 ate an apple on T73 (moving from (8, 5) to (8, 4)), the body would be: [(8, 4), (8, 5), ..., (4, 6)]. The new tail would be (4, 6).\nThe current board shows $H_1=(8, 3)$. The move was DOWN. This implies S1 moved from (8, 4) to (8, 3) on Turn 74 (if the board reflects state *before* the move), but the prompt says \"Turn: 74 / 150\" and then lists the current state and actions taken *up to* this decision point. The last move *was* DOWN. In the previous turn's analysis, S1 head was at (8, 5). Down to (8, 4). If an apple was eaten, length is 13. If not, length is 12, and tail moved.\n\nLet's trust the current displayed state for Turn 74: $H_1 = (8, 3)$. Body is listed. The tail is (7, 6). To get to (8, 3), the snake came from (8, 4) on the move just executed (Turn 73's chosen move).\nIf S1 moved DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4) (T73), and then moved DOWN from (8, 4) to (8, 3) (T74), there are missing turns or confusion.\n\nGiven the structure, we must assume:\n1. The current state (Head (8, 3), Body list, Apples 12) is the state *before* we choose the move for Turn 74.\n2. The \"LAST MOVE PICK\" refers to the move we made *last turn* (T73 choice), which led us from the state described in the rationale (H=(8, 5)) to the current state (H=(8, 3)). This is highly contradictory.\n\n**Re-evaluating based on Rationale Structure:** The rationale describes T73. The move chosen was DOWN. The rationale predicted targeting A(8, 0).\nIf H T73 start was (8, 5), DOWN move puts H at (8, 4). If an apple was eaten, L=13. If not, L=12, tail moves.\nThe current state for T74 shows H=(8, 3). This implies the snake moved (8, 5) -> (8, 4) [T73] -> (8, 3) [T74? Wait, we are choosing T74 move].\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** The information block under \"Turn: 74 / 150\" *is the state before my move for Turn 74*. The \"LAST MOVE INFO\" describes the move chosen *at Turn 73*.\n\nIf T73 move was DOWN from (8, 5): New head is (8, 4).\nIf S1 achieved H=(8, 3) by T74, they must have made two moves already, or the body list is dynamically updating based on an unstated T73 outcome.\nLet's stick to the explicit current state: $H_1 = (8, 3)$. The move chosen on T73 led to this position (or the previous position was (8, 4) and T73 was the move that got us there). The board display confirms T=(8, 3) is the head.\n\n**Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (8, 3)**\n$H_1 = (8, 3)$.\n$B_1$ (excluding head): [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)].\nTail is (7, 6). The cell previously occupied by the tail (which we assume is (7, 7) if no apple was eaten on T73, or (8, 3) if one was eaten and the body list is truncated) is now safe, but in multi-apple games, we usually assume the tail cell is vacated *unless* an apple was eaten. Since the body list is length 12, and the head is (8, 3), if no apple was eaten on T73, the tail (7, 6) is the one that will move out. The cell (7, 6) becomes safe *after* the T74 move is resolved.\n\nNeighbors of (8, 3):\n1. UP (8, 4): Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (7, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (9, 3): Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Consider Apples and Enemy Position**\nApples: A = {(8, 0), (9, 1), (5, 3), (0, 0), (3, 9)}.\n$H_0 = (7, 0)$. $B_0$ is long, its tail is near (2, 4) or (2, 5). S0 is moving along the edge towards A(8, 0).\n\nThe primary target remains A(8, 0). We need to move towards it.\nPath to (8, 0) from (8, 3): (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0). Requires 3 moves.\n\n**Step 3: Predict S0 Move and Collision Check**\nH0 is at (7, 0). S0 must be aiming for (8, 0).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0), it eats the apple and overtakes us if we are too slow.\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 1), it avoids (8, 0) this turn.\n\nIf S1 chooses DOWN (8, 2):\nIf S0 chooses RIGHT (8, 0): S0 eats A(8, 0) this turn (T74). S1 is 1 step away. We lose the apple. S0 length increases.\n\nIf S1 chooses LEFT (7, 3): Distance to A(8, 0) is now 4 moves (min). S0 clearly gets it.\n\nIf S1 chooses RIGHT (9, 3): Distance to A(8, 0) is now 5 moves (min). S0 clearly gets it.\n\nIf S0 is predicted to eat A(8, 0) this turn by moving RIGHT to (8, 0):\nWe must re-evaluate our long-term path. We have 12 apples, S0 has 21. We must try to steal apples or force S0 into danger.\n\nIf S0 eats A(8, 0) this turn (T74):\nNew $H_0'$ at (8, 0).\nS0 Length increases.\n\nWhat about other apples?\nA(5, 3) is mid-board. S1 is at (8, 3). S0 is at (7, 0).\nA(9, 1) is close to S1's right flank, but S1 is currently moving down.\n\nLet's see if we can pivot to A(5, 3).\n(8, 3) -> (7, 3) [LEFT] -> (6, 3) [LEFT] -> (5, 3) [LEFT]. Total 3 moves.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 3):\nIf S0 moves to (8, 0) [Eats A(8, 0)]: S0 is safe.\nIf S0 moves to (7, 1) [UP]: S0 is still targeting the bottom edge.\nS1 moving LEFT positions us such that we are now adjacent to S0's path line (if S0 moves up from (7, 0) to (7, 1)).\n\nIf we commit to the vertical line (DOWN -> (8, 2)): We confirm losing A(8, 0) this turn, but we are positioned best to acquire A(9, 1) next turn if we move (8, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1). This requires 2 turns assuming S0 ignores (9, 1).\n\nLet's compare movements assuming S0 grabs A(8, 0) by moving RIGHT (8, 0) on T74.\n\nOption A: DOWN to (8, 2). (T74)\nT75: S1 at (8, 2). S0 at (8, 0) [New L=23]. $H_0$ likely moves UP (8, 1) or RIGHT (9, 0).\nIf S0 moves (8, 1), S1 can move RIGHT to (9, 2), then UP to (9, 1) to get A(9, 1) on T76. Distance 2 moves.\n\nOption B: LEFT to (7, 3). (T74)\nT75: S1 at (7, 3). S0 at (8, 0) [New L=23]. S0 likely moves UP to (8, 1).\nS1 needs 2 moves to reach A(5, 3) ((7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3)). S0 needs 2 moves to reach A(5, 3) if it moves UP (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) - S0 is currently far. S1 is better positioned for A(5, 3) via LEFT movement.\n\nA(5, 3) is a mid-board apple, generally safer to target than edge apples that competing snakes are already engaging. Since A(8, 0) is likely lost based on the proximity of S0, pivoting to A(5, 3) seems strategically better than confirming a loss at A(8, 0) by moving DOWN, only to find S0 occupying it already.\n\nIf we move LEFT (7, 3): We threaten A(5, 3) while staying away from S0's current cluster around (7, 0).\nWe must check for collision with S0 on T74:\nS1 moves LEFT to (7, 3).\nS0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0). No collision.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 1) instead of RIGHT:\nS1 moves LEFT to (7, 3). No collision.\n\nPivoting to A(5, 3) using LEFT seems the most proactive move when A(8, 0) is almost certainly going to S0 this turn. We must maintain forward momentum towards an achievable goal.\n\n**Collision Check for LEFT (7, 3)**\n1. Off board: No.\n2. Self collision: (7, 3) is not in $B_1$. Safe.\n3. S0 collision: $H_0 = (7, 0)$. S0 options (8, 0 or 7, 1). (7, 3) is safe from both immediate predicted moves. If S0 moves to (7, 1), they are still far.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move towards A(5, 3) via LEFT moves to secure an apple and position ourselves centrally.\n\nMy last move selected was DOWN based on the previous rationale aiming to secure A(8, 0) which S0 was chasing from the left. Since the current state shows us significantly further from A(8, 0) than anticipated, we pivot.\n\nLEFT",

Last move was DOWN, moving from (8, 5) to (8, 4) in the previous turn's analysis (though the provided last move section states the move was DOWN from (8, 5) resulting in (8, 4) in that setup, the current state shows Head (8, 3) and the body indicates a move sequence ending at (8, 3)).\n\nLet's re-establish the current state based on Turn 74 information:\nHead $H_1 = (8, 3)$.\nBody $B_1$: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]. Length 13. Tail is (7, 6). If this is Turn 74, and the snake didn't eat on T73, the previous tail (4, 6) should be gone, and the new tail should be (5, 6) if the previous body was indeed long before T73.\nIf S1 ate an apple on T73 (moving from (8, 5) to (8, 4)), the body would be: [(8, 4), (8, 5), ..., (4, 6)]. The new tail would be (4, 6).\nThe current board shows $H_1=(8, 3)$. The move was DOWN. This implies S1 moved from (8, 4) to (8, 3) on Turn 74 (if the board reflects state *before* the move), but the prompt says \"Turn: 74 / 150\" and then lists the current state and actions taken *up to* this decision point. The last move *was* DOWN. In the previous turn's analysis, S1 head was at (8, 5). Down to (8, 4). If an apple was eaten, length is 13. If not, length is 12, and tail moves.\n\nLet's trust the current displayed state for Turn 74: $H_1 = (8, 3)$. Body is listed. The tail is (7, 6). To get to (8, 3), the snake came from (8, 4) on the move just executed (Turn 73's chosen move).\nIf S1 moved DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4) (T73), and then moved DOWN from (8, 4) to (8, 3) (T74), there are missing turns or confusion.\n\n**Crucial Assumption:** The information block under \"Turn: 74 / 150\" *is the state before my move for Turn 74*. The \"LAST MOVE INFO\" describes the move chosen *at Turn 73*.\n\nIf T73 move was DOWN from (8, 5): New head is (8, 4).\nIf S1 achieved H=(8, 3) by T74, they must have made two moves already, or the body list is dynamically updating based on an unstated T73 outcome.\nLet's stick to the explicit current state: $H_1 = (8, 3)$. The move chosen on T73 led to this position (or the previous position was (8, 4) and T73 was the move that got us there). The board display confirms T=(8, 3) is the head.\n\n**Step 1: Determine S1 Safe Moves from (8, 3)**\n$H_1 = (8, 3)$.\n$B_1$ (excluding head): [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)].\nTail is (7, 6). The cell previously occupied by the tail (which we assume is (7, 7) if no apple was eaten on T73, or (8, 3) if one was eaten and the body list is truncated) is now safe, but in multi-apple games, we usually assume the tail cell is vacated *unless* an apple was eaten. Since the body list is length 12, and the head is (8, 3), if no apple was eaten on T73, the tail (7, 6) is the one that will move out. The cell (7, 6) becomes safe *after* the T74 move is resolved.\n\nNeighbors of (8, 3):\n1. UP (8, 4): Self collision ($B_1$).\n2. DOWN (8, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (7, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (9, 3): Safe.\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(8, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Consider Apples and Enemy Position**\nApples: A = {(8, 0), (9, 1), (5, 3), (0, 0), (3, 9)}.\n$H_0 = (7, 0)$. $B_0$ is long, its tail is near (2, 4) or (2, 5). S0 is moving along the edge towards A(8, 0).\n\nThe primary target remains A(8, 0). We need to move towards it.\nPath to (8, 0) from (8, 3): (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0). Requires 3 moves.\n\n**Step 3: Predict S0 Move and Collision Check**\nH0 is at (7, 0). S0 must be aiming for (8, 0).\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0), it eats the apple and overtakes us if we are too slow.\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 1), it avoids (8, 0) this turn.\n\nIf S1 chooses DOWN (8, 2):\nIf S0 chooses RIGHT (8, 0): S0 eats A(8, 0) this turn (T74). S1 is 1 step away. We lose the apple. S0 length increases.\n\nIf S1 chooses LEFT (7, 3): Distance to A(8, 0) is now 4 moves (min). S0 clearly gets it.\n\nIf S1 chooses RIGHT (9, 3): Distance to A(8, 0) is now 5 moves (min). S0 clearly gets it.\n\nIf S0 is predicted to eat A(8, 0) this turn by moving RIGHT to (8, 0):\nWe must re-evaluate our long-term path. We have 12 apples, S0 has 21. We must try to steal apples or force S0 into danger.\n\nIf S0 eats A(8, 0) this turn (T74):\nNew $H_0'$ at (8, 0).\nS0 Length increases.\n\nWhat about other apples?\nA(5, 3) is mid-board. S1 is at (8, 3). S0 is at (7, 0).\nA(9, 1) is close to S1's right flank, but S1 is currently moving down.\n\nLet's see if we can pivot to A(5, 3).\n(8, 3) -> (7, 3) [LEFT] -> (6, 3) [LEFT] -> (5, 3) [LEFT]. Total 3 moves.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 3):\nIf S0 moves to (8, 0) [Eats A(8, 0)]: S0 is safe.\nIf S0 moves to (7, 1) [UP]: S0 is still targeting the bottom edge.\nS1 moving LEFT positions us such that we are now adjacent to S0's path line (if S0 moves up from (7, 0) to (7, 1)).\n\nIf we commit to the vertical line (DOWN -> (8, 2)): We confirm losing A(8, 0) this turn, but we are positioned best to acquire A(9, 1) next turn if we move (8, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1). This requires 2 turns assuming S0 ignores (9, 1).\n\nLet's compare movements assuming S0 grabs A(8, 0) by moving RIGHT (8, 0) on T74.\n\nOption A: DOWN to (8, 2). (T74)\nT75: S1 at (8, 2). S0 at (8, 0) [New L=23]. $H_0$ likely moves UP (8, 1) or RIGHT (9, 0).\nIf S0 moves (8, 1), S1 can move RIGHT to (9, 2), then UP to (9, 1) to get A(9, 1) on T76. Distance 2 moves.\n\nOption B: LEFT to (7, 3). (T74)\nT75: S1 at (7, 3). S0 at (8, 0) [New L=23]. S0 likely moves UP to (8, 1).\nS1 needs 2 moves to reach A(5, 3) ((7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3)). S0 needs 2 moves to reach A(5, 3) if it moves UP (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) - S0 is currently far. S1 is better positioned for A(5, 3) via LEFT movement.\n\nA(5, 3) is a mid-board apple, generally safer to target than edge apples that competing snakes are already engaging. Since A(8, 0) is likely lost based on the proximity of S0, pivoting to A(5, 3) seems strategically better than confirming a loss at A(8, 0) by moving DOWN, only to find S0 occupying it already.\n\nIf we move LEFT (7, 3): We threaten A(5, 3) while staying away from S0's current cluster around (7, 0).\nWe must check for collision with S0 on T74:\nS1 moves LEFT to (7, 3).\nS0 moves RIGHT to (8, 0). No collision.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 1) instead of RIGHT:\nS1 moves LEFT to (7, 3). No collision.\n\nPivoting to A(5, 3) using LEFT seems the most proactive move when A(8, 0) is almost certainly going to S0 this turn. We must maintain forward momentum towards an achievable goal.\n\nMy last move selected was DOWN based on the previous rationale aiming to secure A(8, 0) which S0 was chasing from the left. Since the current state shows us significantly further from A(8, 0) than anticipated, we pivot.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nTurn: 75 / 150. Head at (8, 3).\nMy previous move was LEFT, placing me at (7, 3) IF that was the move chosen. However, the input structure shows the rationale *for* Turn 74 ending with a LEFT pick, but the current state is $H_1=(8, 3)$. This means the provided \"LAST MOVE PICK\" (LEFT) was *discarded* or the state provided is immediately *before* the move for T75, preceded by a move T74 whose outcome resulted in H=(8, 3).\n\nGiven the discrepancy, I must assume the current state $H=(8, 3)$ is the starting point for deciding the T75 move, and the \"LAST MOVE PICK\" refers to the *last move choice selection* made previously, regardless of the resulting state listed above it. Since there is no explicit T74 move result listed, I rely on the current state $H=(8, 3)$. My last rationale determined LEFT was optimal to pivot towards A(5, 3). I will proceed with that strategy unless the new state implies termination or immediate danger.\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (8, 3): (8, 2) [DOWN], (7, 3) [LEFT], (9, 3) [RIGHT]. (Up (8, 4) is blocked by body).\n\nApples: A = {(9, 1), (5, 3), (0, 0), (3, 9), (4, 1)}. A(8, 0) is *gone* (Snake 0 must have eaten it, as H0 is at (8, 0) in the board display now, and S0 has 22 apples).\n\nS0 is at (8, 0). S0 just ate A(8, 0) and grew. S0's next likely move is UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0).\n\nGoal evaluation:\n1. A(5, 3): Distance 2 moves via LEFT, LEFT. ((7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3)).\n2. A(9, 1): Distance 2 moves via RIGHT, UP. ((9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1)). This is closer to S0's current location (+1, 0).\n3. A(3, 9): Far.\n4. A(0, 0), A(4, 1): Far or less advantageous.\n\nComparing LEFT (7, 3) vs RIGHT (9, 3).\n\nIf I choose LEFT (7, 3) aiming for A(5, 3):\n$H_1' = (7, 3)$.\nS0 Prediction: S0 moves UP (8, 1) to continue clearing the edge, or RIGHT (9, 0) to expand. If S0 moves (8, 1), (7, 3) is safe. If S0 moves (9, 0), (7, 3) is safe.\nThis sets up a potential apple grab in 2 turns.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (9, 3) aiming for A(9, 1):\n$H_1' = (9, 3)$.\nS0 Prediction: If S0 moves UP (8, 1), (9, 3) is safe. If S0 moves RIGHT (9, 0), this creates a potential collision threat or blockage on the right edge one turn later, but A(9, 1) is closer horizontally.\n\nThe path to A(5, 3) feels more secure as it leads into the center board, away from S0's immediate path expansion (which is currently vertical along X=7/8). A(9, 1) forces us closer to S0's domain edge.\n\nI stick with the plan derived in the previous rationale: pivot towards the accessible, centralized A(5, 3). This requires LEFT.\n\nCollision check for LEFT (7, 3):\n1. Self: Safe. Body cells are (8, 4) down to (7, 6). (7, 3) is clear.\n2. S0 collision: $H_0 = (8, 0)$. Safe moves for S0 are likely (8, 1) or (9, 0). (7, 3) is safe from both immediate moves.\n\nStrategy: Continue pursuit of A(5, 3) which is 2 moves away via LEFT.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move towards A(5, 3). If successful, re-evaluate A(3, 9) and A(4, 1) while watching S0's expansion into the center. If S0 attempts to block A(5, 3) route, pivot to A(9, 1).\n\nLEFT",

S1 has 12 apples.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Self-Safe Moves for S1 from (6, 3)**\nBody $B_1$: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 5), ..., (7, 8)].\nPredecessor (cell previously occupied by head, needed for backward collision check): (7, 3).\nNeighbors of (6, 3):\n1. UP (6, 4): Safe.\n2. DOWN (6, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (5, 3): This is A(5, 3)! If we move here, we eat the apple and grow. Safe from self-collision because (5, 3) is not in the body list [(7, 3), (8, 3), ...].\n4. RIGHT (7, 3): Blocked by body segment (7, 3). (Note: The segment list provided seems to have an error or reflects a very strange turn history if the head is (6, 3) but (7, 3) is occupied by a body part while the move before suggested a pivot towards (7, 3). Let's trust the board visualization: (6, 3) is followed by (7, 3). If the head moves to (7, 3), it collides with the next segment. The board visualization shows:\nRow 3: . . . . A 1 T T . (T at (7, 3), 1 at (6, 3))\nSo, (7, 3) is indeed occupied by $B_1$. Move RIGHT is blocked by the body.)\n\nS1 Safe Moves: $S1_{safe} = \\{(6, 4), (6, 2), (5, 3)\\}$.\n\nSince (5, 3) is an apple and SAFE, moving LEFT to eat it is the highest priority move.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Immediate Imminent Kills (T76 Simultaneous Move)**\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (5, 3) (eating A(5, 3)):\nNew $H_1' = (5, 3)$. Length increases by 1. $A_1$ becomes 13.\nThe cell (6, 3) is vacated (unless we grew, in which case the tail moves one segment further back).\n\nWe must check if $H_0$ moves into the space vacated by $H_1$, or if $H_0$ moves into $B_1$'s new configuration.\n$H_0 = (8, 1)$. $B_0$: long body along the boundaries.\n\nPossible $H_0$ moves: (7, 1) [RIGHT], (8, 2) [UP], (9, 1) [RIGHT, eating A(9, 1)], (8, 0) [DOWN, but S0 is already at (8, 0) in the board state provided for T76].\n***Wait, the board state shows H0 at (8, 1)***. The previous turn analysis showed $\\text{H0}=(8, 0)$ after eating A(8, 0).\nLet's re-examine the Board State for T76:\nRow 1: T T T T A . . . 0 A (S0 Head is at (8, 1), A at (9, 1))\nIf H0 is at (8, 1), the previous move (T75) must have been UP from (8, 0). If S0 was at (8, 0) after eating A(8, 0) on T74, then on T75 S0 moved up to (8, 1).\n\nIf $H_0 = (8, 1)$, safe moves for S0:\n1. UP (8, 2).\n2. DOWN (8, 0): Collides with $B_0$'s segment at (8, 0) IF S0 HASN'T GROWN since eating A(8, 0) on T74. Given S0's high score (22) and the fact that the board shows H0 at (8, 1) now, they likely ate another apple or their body list is highly complex/misrepresenting the tail movement. Assuming they grew on T74 and T75.\n3. RIGHT (9, 1): Eats A(9, 1)! This means S0 is about to eat an apple right next to S1's prime target A(5, 3).\n4. LEFT (7, 1): Safe.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (9, 1) (eats A(9, 1)): $H_0' = (9, 1)$.\nS1 moves LEFT to (5, 3). $H_1' = (5, 3)$.\nNo collision. We both score.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT, we secure A(5, 3). If S0 moves RIGHT, S0 secures A(9, 1). This results in a favorable exchange: we get 1 apple, S0 gets 1 apple. We are now at 13 apples vs S0 at 23. We need to catch up, so capturing any available apple is critical.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate other options if we don't take A(5, 3)**\nIf S1 moves UP to (6, 4): S0 might move to (9, 1) (A9, 1) or (8, 2). We let A(5, 3) remain for next turn, which is risky as S0 might pivot towards the center, or we might encounter S0's massive body.\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (6, 2): Same risk profile regarding A(5, 3).\n\nTaking the instantaneous apple at (5, 3) is the objectively best move as it is safe and increases our score immediately.\n\nLong-Term Plan (for turn 77): After eating A(5, 3), $H_1$ is at (5, 3). S0 is likely at (9, 1) or (8, 2). The remaining apples are A(0, 0), A(3, 9), A(4, 1). A(4, 1) is now closest for a 1-move follow-up (via DOWN from (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) is 3 moves, or (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) is 3 moves). S0 might start heading towards the center too. Plan: Prioritize A(4, 1) next, potentially moving DOWN or LEFT depending on S0's T76 move.\n\nFinal choice: LEFT to secure A(5, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Board size 10x10.\nCurrent Head $H_1 = (5, 3)$ (from eating A(5, 3) last turn).\nApples remaining: A = {(0, 0), (3, 9), (4, 1), (1, 9), (2, 2)}.\nS1 Apples: 13. S0 Apples: 23.\n\nS1 Body $B_1$: [(6, 3) was vacated, (7, 3) is now head's predecessor, (8, 3), ..., (7, 8)].\nThe body list provided in the prompt reflects state BEFORE T76 move completed, but based on the rationale, we assume $H_1$ is now at (5, 3) and the body has grown by one segment, pushing the tail further back if needed, or simply adding (6, 3) as the new segment right behind the head.\nLet's reconstruct the body for T77 based on the T76 move (LEFT from (6, 3) to (5, 3)) AND the assumption that the apple was eaten (score 13).\nPrevious head: (6, 3). Previous body: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)].\nNew Head: (5, 3).\nNew Body: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)]. (The tail did not move as we grew.)\nSelf-collision check (backwards move): The cell behind (5, 3) is (6, 3), which is the new first body segment. Moving LEFT to (4, 3)$ would require checking (6, 3). If we move to (4, 3), the next cell would still be (6, 3). If we move RIGHT to (6, 3), we hit ourselves.\n\nEnemy Head $H_0$: (8, 1). S0 likely ate A(9, 1) last turn, moving from (8, 1) to (9, 1). Let's check S0's potential move based on the board state shown (H0=(9, 1) in the board state provided for T77).\nIf $H_0$ is at (9, 1) (as per board state for T77), it means S0 moved RIGHT from (8, 1) and ate A(9, 1). S0 Apples = 24. The body of S0 must extend from (8, 1) backwards. The provided body for S0 stops at (2, 5). This confirms the body lengths are crucial but difficult to track precisely when only one turn's context is given. We must rely strongly on the current board visualization for safety checks.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Self-Safe Moves for S1 from (5, 3)**\n$H_1 = (5, 3)$.\nBody parts near head (from visualization, Row 3): (6, 3) is $B_1$, (7, 3) is $B_1$.\nNeighbors of (5, 3):\n1. UP (5, 4): Safe (Empty spot).\n2. DOWN (5, 2): Safe (Empty spot).\n3. LEFT (4, 3): Safe (Empty spot).\n4. RIGHT (6, 3): Blocked by body segment (6, 3).\n\nS1 Safe Moves (Self-check): $S1_{safe} = \\{(5, 4), (5, 2), (4, 3)\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Enemy Collisions (S0 moves from (9, 1))**\n$H_0 = (9, 1)$. S0 Body surrounds the top right corner and left edge.\nPossible moves for $H_0$:\n$H_0$ neighbors are (8, 1) [LEFT, occupied by $B_0$], (9, 0) [DOWN, occupied by $B_0$], (9, 2) [UP].\n\nThe path S0 took previously suggests they are trying to wrap around the board or stay on the periphery. If S0 moves UP to (9, 2):\nS1 moves:\n- (5, 4) UP: Safe from $H_0$.\n- (5, 2) DOWN: Safe from $H_0$.\n- (4, 3) LEFT: Safe from $H_0$.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (not possible, off board).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (9, 0): Blocked by $B_0$ at (9, 0) according to the board diagram (Row 0 shows T at (7,0), (8,0), (9,0) is empty based on the diagram structure, which seems slightly inconsistent with S0 body definition vs visual). Let's trust the visual: Row 1 has T at (8, 1) and A at (9, 1) in the diagram for T76, but the T77 diagram shows H0 at (9, 1) too, and T at (8, 1). This is highly confusing.\n\nLet's rely strictly on the T77 Board State provided at the start of this turn:\nS0 Head: (9, 1). S0 Body ends at (2, 5). Collision check for $H_0$.\nS0 Neighbors: (8, 1) is body, (9, 0) is body if S0 followed its path perfectly. (9, 2) is empty.\n\nWe calculate S0's safest move based on its visible body:\n$B_0$ segments near (9, 1) appear to include (8, 1) and (9, 0) (from Row 0 T).\nIf (9, 0) is occupied by $B_0$ (T in row 0), then S0 cannot move DOWN.\nIf (8, 1) is occupied by $B_0$, S0 cannot move LEFT.\nS0 is likely forced UP to (9, 2) or potentially RIGHT if the boundary is not treated as a solid wall for collisions (it is for S1, but S0 might be able to exit if it's the edge of the map, which it isn't (9, 1) -> (10, 1) is out).\n\nAssuming S0 moves UP to (9, 2) (most likely unconstrained move for S0).\nS1 (5, 3) is very far from (9, 2). No collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic Apple Pursuit**\nApples left: A(0, 0), A(3, 9), A(1, 9), A(2, 2), A(4, 1).\nThe immediate proximity is to A(4, 1) if we look at Manhattan distance from (5, 3).\nDistances from (5, 3):\nTo (4, 1): $1 + 2 = 3$ moves (e.g., L, D, D).\nTo (2, 2): $3 + 1 = 4$ moves (e.g., L, L, L, D).\nTo (0, 0): $5 + 3 = 8$ moves.\nTo (3, 9) or (1, 9): Far north.\n\nThe closest apple is A(4, 1). We should move towards it.\nMove towards A(4, 1) from (5, 3) requires reducing X by 1 and Y by 2.\n1. LEFT to (4, 3): Directly sets up for two DOWN moves. This is the most direct route towards the closest cluster of apples A(4, 1) and A(2, 2).\n\nLet's check the next potential S0 move. S0 is massive and near the edge. It might try to snake inwards from the top right. We want to secure the bottom-center area.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 2) means we are 2 steps away from A(4, 1) (L, D).\nMoving LEFT to (4, 3) means we are 1 step away from A(4, 1) if we move D, D next.\n\nIf we go LEFT (4, 3): (T78 Goal: (4, 2) or (5, 2)).\nIf we go DOWN (5, 2): (T78 Goal: (4, 2) or (5, 1)).\n\nThe path (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) takes 3 moves.\nThe path (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) takes 3 moves.\n\nLEFT seems marginally better as it brings us closer to the X coordinate of A(4, 1), which is useful if S0 tries to cut across the middle later. Given the flexibility, LEFT is chosen to pursue A(4, 1).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Focus on harvesting A(4, 1) and A(2, 2). If S0 turns towards the lower half, be prepared to pivot, perhaps prioritizing A(2, 2) over A(4, 1) protection if S0 approaches A(4, 1) faster. Given S0's long path, we have a decent window.\n\nLEFT",

S0 Apples: 23.\n\n**Reconstruct State based on Last Move Rationale:**\nThe rationale selected LEFT, moving from $H_1=(5, 3)$ to $H_1=(4, 3)$.\nThe board state provided at the start of Turn 78 shows $H_1$ at (4, 3) (Row 3, Col 4 is '1'). This confirms the move was successful and we are now starting Turn 78 from (4, 3), having eaten an apple last turn (Score 14, although the problem description says \"Apples collected: 13\" for S1, suggesting the apple eaten *at* (5, 3) was the 13th, and we are starting T78 at (4, 3) before the move). I will proceed assuming $H_1=(4, 3)$ is my current location for Turn 78, and my score is 13 (as stated immediately above the move selection). The body listed in the initial prompt reflects the state *before* the move from (5, 3) was potentially registered.\nLet's use the visualization map and the coordinates given right before move selection, as that is the most consistent input for the current turn's decision *if* the Rationale was executed successfully on T77.\n\n$H_1 = (4, 3)$.\nBody near head (from map): (5, 3) is $B_1$. (The map shows T at (5, 3) in row 3, which must be the immediate predecessor to (4, 3)).\n$B_1$ Segments near (4, 3): (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)...\nNeighbors of (4, 3):\n1. UP (4, 4): Safe.\n2. DOWN (4, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (3, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (5, 3): Blocked by body segment (5, 3).\n\nS1 Safe Moves (Self-check): $S1_{safe} = \\{(4, 4), (4, 2), (3, 3)\\}$.\n\n**Enemy Head $H_0$ Location & Potential Moves:**\n$H_0 = (9, 2)$. (From board state provided).\n$H_0$ Neighbors: (8, 2) [LEFT, Empty], (9, 1) [DOWN, Body segment T if we trust the T77 body listed, or A(9, 1) if we go by T76 state]. (9, 3) [UP, Empty].\n\nConsulting the T77 Body for S0: S0 ends at (2, 5). Let's trust the visual map for safety:\nRow 2: T at (2, 2) and A at (2, 2). H0 at (9, 2).\nRow 1: T at (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)... T at (8, 1), (9, 1).\nIf $H_0$ is at (9, 2), likely neighbors occupied by $B_0$ are (9, 1) (DOWN) and potentially (8, 2) or (10, 2) (out). If S0 moved from (9, 1) UP to (9, 2), then (9, 1) is safe for S1.\n\nPossible $H_0$ moves: (8, 2), (9, 3). (If (9, 1) is occupied, down move is blocked).\n\n**Collision Check of S1 moves against $H_0$ moves:**\nIf S1 moves to (3, 3). $H_0$ moves to (8, 2): Safe. $H_0$ moves to (9, 3): Safe.\nIf S1 moves to (4, 2). $H_0$ moves to (8, 2): Safe. $H_0$ moves to (9, 3): Safe.\nIf S1 moves to (4, 4). $H_0$ moves to (8, 2): Safe. $H_0$ moves to (9, 3): Safe.\nNo immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple Pursuit Strategy:**\nCurrent $H_1 = (4, 3)$. Apples: A(0, 0), A(3, 9), A(4, 1), A(1, 9), A(2, 2).\nDistance to closest apples:\n1. A(4, 1): $0 X, 2 Y$. Needs DOWN, DOWN. (2 moves).\n2. A(2, 2): $2 X, 1 Y$. Needs LEFT, LEFT, DOWN. (3 moves).\n3. A(3, 9), A(1, 9): Very far north.\n\nTargeting A(4, 1) is optimal as it is reachable in 2 moves.\nMoves towards A(4, 1):\n- DOWN (4, 2). Next move can be DOWN again to (4, 1).\n\nStrategy: Focus purely on A(4, 1) first, as it's the closest and guarantees growth fast. S0 is busy far away in the top right.\n\nMove (4, 2) seems best to set up the immediate collection of A(4, 1) next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Prioritize A(4, 1) in the next two turns. If A(4, 1) is collected, the next targets are A(2, 2) or pivot north if S0 moves aggressively towards the bottom half. Since S0 is currently high, securing the low-hanging fruit is safe.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If this list is head-to-tail, (4, 3) is the neck. This list seems to imply the head *was* (4, 3) before the last move, BUT the prompt explicitly states the Head is (4, 2) for Turn 79 *and* the last move was DOWN. This means the body provided in the initial state description MUST HAVE BEEN UPDATED to reflect $H_1=(4, 2)$ and the new tail has been dropped (since $13$ apples means the body length is $14$, and $23$ apples for S0 means length $24$). The list provided has 13 segments listed after the head, total length 14. This suggests no apple was eaten on T78.\n\nIf $H_1$ is (4, 2) and the previous head was (4, 3) (from rationale), then the body should be:\nNew Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), ..., (8, 9) (old tail)]. Length 14 (13 segments + head).\n\n$H_1 = (4, 2)$.\nNeighbors for S1:\n1. UP (4, 3): Occupied by neck segment. BLOCKED.\n2. DOWN (4, 1): Apple A(4, 1). Safe.\n3. LEFT (3, 2): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (5, 2): Safe.\n\n$S1_{safe} = \\{(4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2)\\}$.\n\n**Enemy Head $H_0$ Location & Potential Moves:**\n$H_0 = (8, 2)$. (From board state provided, Row 2, Col 8 is '0').\n$B_0$ segments nearby: (9, 2) is next to H0. (9, 1) and (8, 1) are body segments.\n\n$H_0$ Neighbor check (based on map):\n- DOWN (8, 1): Blocked by $B_0$.\n- LEFT (7, 2): Safe.\n- UP (8, 3): Blocked by $B_1$. (If S1 body is at (7, 3) then (8, 3) is NOT our body).\nLet's check S1 body relative to (8, 3): Body ends at (8, 9) up in the corner. (7, 3) is in the body list. (8, 3) is in the body list. So (8, 3) is BLOCKED by $B_1$.\n- RIGHT (9, 2): Blocked by $B_0$.\n\nIf $H_0$ moved into (8, 2) this turn, its previous position was likely (9, 2) or (8, 1) or (7, 2) or (8, 3).\nLooking at the board: Snake #0 occupies a large area in the right/top-right/left border.\nS0 Body (T77 state): [(9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]. Length 24 + Head -> 25 segments listed, 23 apples eaten. This list looks like the body *before* the tail dropped, or it includes the head. Given 23 apples, the length should be 24 cells. This list has 23 cells listed after the head? No, 23 cells listed total in the body list provided in the prompt description for T79 state check. Let's rely on the map visualization where H0 is at (8, 2).\n\nIf $H_0$ moves:\n1. DOWN to (8, 1): Blocked by $B_0$. (If (8, 1) is $B_0$)\n2. UP to (8, 3): Blocked by $B_1$. (Since (8, 3) is in S1 body).\n3. LEFT to (7, 2): Safe (Empty on map).\n4. RIGHT to (9, 2): Blocked by $B_0$ (Since (9, 2) is in S0 body).\n\n$H_0$ likely safe moves: Only (7, 2).\n\n**Collision Check for S1 moves vs $P_0 = \\{(7, 2)\\}$:**\n1. S1 UP to (4, 3): Collision None.\n2. S1 DOWN to (4, 1) (Apple): Collision None.\n3. S1 LEFT to (3, 2): Collision None.\n4. S1 RIGHT to (5, 2): Collision None.\n\nNo immediate collisions, so we execute the apple pursuit plan.\n\n**Apple Pursuit Strategy:**\nTarget A(4, 1) at (4, 1). Current $H_1=(4, 2)$.\nMove DOWN to (4, 1) collects the apple. This sets up score increase to 14, and the snake grows (length 15).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (4, 1):\nNew Head: (4, 1).\nNew Body: (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), ... (8, 9) (old tail).\nThe snake eats the apple, so the tail does NOT drop. Length increases by 1 (15 total segments).\n\n$H_0$ will likely move to (7, 2). This places $H_0$ relatively far from $H_1$'s path toward the remaining apples (A(0, 0), A(2, 2), A(3, 9), A(1, 9)). After eating (4, 1), the next target is A(2, 2).\n\nLong Term Plan: Sequence: DOWN (eat A(4, 1)), then move towards A(2, 2). This keeps us away from S0 who is currently cornered in the right side or moving towards the left border.\n\n**Safety Check for Body Update (Crucial Step):**\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 1) and eat A(4, 1):\n$H_{new} = (4, 1)$.\n$B_{new} = \\{(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)\\}$.\nThe segment (8, 9) remains as the tail because an apple was eaten.\n\nSnake #0 moves to (7, 2). The board position (4, 1) is safe from collision.\n\nThe optimal move is clearly DOWN to secure the closest apple.\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize eating A(4, 1). Next turn, reassess available apples, likely targeting A(2, 2). Ensure no direct path is created for S0 to cut us off against the edges.\n\nDOWN",

The provided body list seems to represent $14$ segments including the new tail drop, or it simply reflects the previous body configuration where they dropped the tail *before* recognizing the score update, or the $8, 8$ in the body list is a typo vs the $8, 9$ sequence ending the previous list structure.

(4, 0) is safe (T at (3, 0) and (4, 0) is empty based on map). Map check: (4, 0) is empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT (3, 1): Blocked by $B_0$. Map check: (3, 1) is 'T' (S0 body). Blocked.\n4. RIGHT (5, 1): Safe.\n\n$S1_{safe} = \\{(4, 0), (5, 1)\\}$.\n\nApples remaining: A(0, 0), A(3, 9), A(1, 9), A(2, 2), A(1, 2).\nTargets are A(2, 2) or A(1, 2) (closest group of 2). A(0, 0) is very far left/down corner. A(3, 9), A(1, 9) are far up.\n\nPath to A(2, 2) or A(1, 2):\nH1 (4, 1) -> Needs to go Left/Up.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 1): This moves me away from the next closest target cluster ((2, 2), (1, 2)). It places me further into the center-right where S0 is heavily established. Bad idea.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 0): This moves me toward A(0, 0). Path: (4, 0) -> (3, 0) (Blocked by B0) or (4, -1) (Off board). This path seems bad because (3, 0) is occupied by S0 body, trapping me near the edge quickly if I go this way aggressively.\n\nLet's analyze movement towards A(2, 2) / A(1, 2).\n(4, 1) -> (3, 1) [Blocked by S0]\n(4, 1) -> (4, 2) [Blocked by S1]\n(4, 1) -> (5, 1) [Safe, move away from apples]\n(4, 1) -> (4, 0) [Safe, move towards A(0, 0), but potentially risky boundary play]\n\nSince (3, 1) and (4, 2) are blocked, the immediate approach to the next closest apples is blocked by my own body or the enemy's body.\n\nIf S0 moves: Both (7, 1) and (6, 2) are safe for S0.\nCase 1: $H_0 \\to (7, 1)$. $H_1 \\to (5, 1)$.\nCase 2: $H_0 \\to (6, 2)$. $H_1 \\to (5, 1)$.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 1), I die (S0 body at (3, 1) from map). Confirmed blocked.\n\nSince all direct paths towards the central apples seem blocked by one definition or another, I must move to a temporary safe location that allows repositioning, ideally one that keeps me generally pointing towards the available apples, or forces S0 into a precarious position.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 1) is safe. It creates space between H1 and the large S0 mass on the right. From (5, 1), I can potentially move UP to (5, 2) next turn, aiming for (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 0), I approach the bottom wall. From (4, 0), my next move UP (4, 1) leads into my own segment (4, 1) which is now the neck segment if I move to (4, 0) and that segment disappears (which it doesn't, since I didn't eat). Ah, (4, 1) is my new head. If I move DOWN to (4, 0), the segment (4, 1) becomes the neck. The cell UP from (4, 0) is (4, 1), which *will be* my neck segment next turn, so I cannot move UP immediately. This is dangerous trapping near the edge.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT (5, 1) is the safest move, even though it increases distance to the desired apples, because it avoids immediate edge trapping and maintains mobility relative to S0's current position near the center-right.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move RIGHT (5, 1) this turn. Next turn, attempt to move UP to (5, 2) if safe, to start heading back towards the A(2, 2) / A(1, 2) cluster. Avoid the corner zone [0, 0] for now as reaching it requires passing through S0 territory on the bottom edge (3, 0) or left edge (0, 1).\n\nPredicted move for S0: Since S0 is highly developed and has many apples, it might try to secure the remaining edges or expand towards the center. (7, 1) or (6, 2) seem equally likely and safe for S0.\n\nThe move RIGHT maximizes current safety margin without immediate trapping.\nRIGHT",

Let's use the actual board visualization for body positions relative to H=(4, 1) and the score=14/length=15):\n    Body positions based on board visualization (T): (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9). *Wait, the board shows 13 T's extending from (4, 2) to (9, 9) via the path, plus (8, 9) which is not explicitly listed in the current body text but was implied during T80 analysis. The provided body list in the prompt must be trusted if it represents the current state.*\n    H1=(4, 1). Body length 14 needed for Score 14.\n    Body list from prompt: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. This is 14 segments. Length is 15. Okay, this list seems correct for Score 14.\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #0 - Head: (7, 2), Body includes (8, 2), (9, 2), (3, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), ..., (1, 8). Length 24.\n\n$H_1=(4, 1)$. Safe moves determined in rationale for T80: (4, 0) [DOWN], (5, 1) [RIGHT]. (4, 2) [UP] is blocked by own body. (3, 1) [LEFT] is blocked by S0 body.\n\n**Evaluate Next State (Simultaneous Move)**\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (5, 1):**\n   * $H_1' = (5, 1)$. This is safe from $B_1$.\n   * S0 Head $H_0=(7, 2)$ moves. Safe options for S0 were $N_0 = \\{(7, 1), (6, 2)\\}$.\n     * If $H_0' = (7, 1)$: Safe. $H_1'$ doesn't collide.\n     * If $H_0' = (6, 2)$: Safe. $H_1'$ doesn't collide.\n   * If $H_1' = (5, 1)$, next move UP to (5, 2) looks promising for closing distance to A(2, 2)/A(1, 2).\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (4, 0):**\n   * $H_1' = (4, 0)$. This is safe from $B_1$.\n   * S0 moves: If $H_0' = (7, 1)$ or $(6, 2)$, this is safe for $H_1'$.\n   * **Risk:** Moving to (4, 0) places $H_1$ adjacent to the bottom wall. From (4, 0), moving UP to (4, 1) next turn puts $H_1$ right where it is now, but $B_1$ will have shifted slightly. More importantly, if S0 gets aggressive, being trapped at the boundary is bad. The primary access to the bottom apple A(0, 0) requires moving left/down, where S0 has significant presence along the bottom edge (e.g., (3, 0) is S0 body).\n\nComparing the two safe moves: RIGHT (5, 1) offers better mobility and avoids the immediate boundary pressure that DOWN (4, 0) incurs. The primary targets A(2, 2) and A(1, 2) require moving generally North/West, and (5, 1) is a better stepping stone than (4, 0).\n\nStrategy: Stick to the plan confirmed in the T80 rationale: prioritize mobility and stay central until a clear, safe path to apples opens up or S0 leaves a segment open.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (5, 1). Next turn, if safe, move UP to (5, 2) to begin closing the distance to the nearest apple cluster ((2, 2), (1, 2)). Continue monitoring S0's expansion and connectivity to the remaining apples, especially A(0, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

Now $H_1$ is at (6, 1). *Wait, my body list update from T81 seems to reflect a state *before* the move RIGHT, but the current head position (6, 1) suggests the move RIGHT was applied to a head at (5, 1) or the board state listed is the result immediately after T81 execution.*\n\nLet's reconcile the T81 information with the T82 provided state:\nT81 Start Head: (4, 1). Move chosen: RIGHT -> Target (5, 1).\nT82 Current Head: (6, 1).\nThis means the move RIGHT was executed, resulting in a head at (5, 1) last turn, and *then* the system has potentially processed a move for T82, setting the head to (6, 1) for this turn analysis.\nThe provided 'Your last move information' shows: **START LAST MOVE PICK: RIGHT**. This implies the move for T81 was RIGHT.\nIf $H_{81, start} = (4, 1)$, then $H_{81, end} = (5, 1)$.\nThe current state says $H_{82, start} = (6, 1)$. This implies the move from T81 resulted in $(5, 1)$, and then the move for T82 must have been RIGHT again to reach $(6, 1)$, OR the body list T81 described was incorrect, and the move RIGHT took (5, 1) -> (6, 1).\n\nGiven the structure of these reports, the 'Your last move information' usually refers to the move *just completed* to arrive at the current board state.\nIf $H_{T82} = (6, 1)$ and the previous move was RIGHT (which increases X), the head prior to this turn must have been $(5, 1)$.\nLet's assume the full sequence from T80 End -> T82 Start is:\n1. T80 End $H=(4, 1)$.\n2. T81 Move RIGHT lands at (5, 1). (This move must have eaten an apple or the tail length changed, as the score is 14 in both T81 and T82 context, but the body list changed dramatically).\n3. T82 Start $H=(6, 1)$. (This implies another RIGHT move happened between T81 completion and T82 start, or my interpretation of the structure is flawed, and T82 turn *starts* with $H=(6,1)$ after the T81 move $RIGHT$).\n\nCrucially, the board visualization shows $H_1$ at (6, 1). The body segments indicated by '1' are: (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8). This is a length 15 snake (14 body segments). This matches Score 14.\nThe body list provided in the T82 prompt confirms this:\nH: (6, 1). Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8)]. (Length 15).\n\nThe snake length is consistent with Score 14. The last move was RIGHT. This means that $H_{T81}$ was $(5, 1)$ and the move RIGHT took it to $(6, 1)$. We must proceed from $H=(6, 1)$ for Turn 82.\n\n**Current State Analysis (T82)**\n$H_1 = (6, 1)$.\n$B_1 = \\{(5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8)\\}$.\n\n$H_0 = (5, 2)$.\n$B_0$ occupies many bottom and left/top edge cells. Notably, $B_0$ is very long (24 segments). $H_0$ is currently positioned between $H_1$ and the primary apple cluster at Y=2.\n\nApples remaining: A(0, 0), A(3, 9), A(1, 9), A(2, 2), A(1, 2).\nThe closest apples are (2, 2) and (1, 2).\n\n**Move Options for $H_1(6, 1)$**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 2):**\n   * Collision Check: (6, 2) is safe regarding $B_1$.\n   * S0 Head ($H_0$ at (5, 2)) moves simultaneously.\n     * If $H_0'$ moves DOWN to (5, 1): $H_1'$ is safe. (5, 1) is $T_1$'s former head position. $B_1$ does not occupy (5, 1) *after* the move, as that segment retracts (becomes the new tail). (5, 1) IS part of $B_1$ currently, so $H_0$ moving here kills $H_0$ unless $T_1$ ate, which it didn't. Wait, $H_1=(6, 1)$, $B_1$ starts with (5, 1). If $H_0$ moves to (5, 1), $H_0$ dies.\n     * If $H_0'$ moves UP to (5, 3): Safe for $H_0$. $H_1'$ is safe from $H_0'$.\n     * If $H_0'$ moves LEFT to (4, 2): (4, 2) is $B_1$. $H_0$ dies.\n     * If $H_0'$ moves RIGHT to (6, 2): Head-to-head collision! Both die.\n\n   * If $H_1$ moves UP to (6, 2):\n     * If $H_0$ moves UP to (5, 3): Safe. $H_1$ is now closer to the apples but doesn't eat anything this turn.\n     * If $H_0$ moves DOWN to (5, 1): $H_0$ hits $B_1$ segment (5, 1) and dies. $H_1$ lives.\n     * If $H_0$ moves LEFT to (4, 2): $H_0$ hits $B_1$ segment (4, 2) and dies. $H_1$ lives.\n     * If $H_0$ moves RIGHT to (6, 2): Both die. $H_1$ is NOT safe if S0 chooses RIGHT.\n\n   * Since S0 is smart and wants to survive primarily, it will avoid moves that kill it, and likely avoid moves that kill $H_1$ if it can survive itself. If S0 can move to (5, 3), it will likely do so, maximizing its head position away from $H_1$. If S0 anticipates $H_1$ moving UP to (6, 2), S0 is likely to move UP to (5, 3) or LEFT/DOWN if they are safe. (5, 3) is safe for S0. This move (UP) is risky due to potential collision at (6, 2) if S0 moves RIGHT.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n   * Collision Check: Safe from $B_1$.\n   * S0 Head ($H_0$ at (5, 2)) moves.\n     * $H_0$ cannot move to (7, 1) as it's too far.\n     * S0 has moves like (5, 3), (6, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1). All seem fine for S0. This move keeps $H_1$ away from the apples for now. Less aggressive than UP.\n\n3. **DOWN to (6, 0):**\n   * Collision Check: (6, 0) is $B_0$. $H_1$ dies instantly. **INVALID**.\n\n4. **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n   * Collision Check: (5, 1) is $B_1$. $H_1$ dies instantly. **INVALID**. (This was the head position last turn).\n\n**Re-evaluating UP (6, 2) vs RIGHT (7, 1)**\n\nThe nearest apples are in the cluster (2, 2), (1, 2). To reach them quickly, a maneuver towards Y=2 is needed. Moving UP to (6, 2) moves $H_1$ directly into the row of $H_0$ ((5, 2)).\n\nIf $H_1 \\to (6, 2)$:\nS0's best defensive/offensive move against $(6, 2)$ is likely RIGHT to $(6, 2)$ (mutual kill) or UP to $(5, 3)$ (survival). Since S0 has many segments, it can afford to play defensively. If S0 moves to (5, 3), $H_1$ is alive, and $H_1$ is now adjacent to $H_0$. Next turn, $H_1$ can try to eat (2, 2) if S0 moves away.\n\nIf $H_1 \\to (7, 1)$:\nThis is a safe positional move, moving away from $H_0$ and keeping options open. It doesn't immediately press toward the apples, but it keeps $H_1$ mobile near the center-right.\n\nSince we seek apples, moving towards them is preferred, even if it involves confrontation, provided the risk of mutual destruction is managed or avoidable.\n\nLet's analyze S0's tendency based on its long body: S0 is likely to try to maintain its massive lead and potentially trap $H_1$. Moving UP to (6, 2) directly challenges $H_0$'s location at (5, 2).\n\nIf $H_1$ moves UP to (6, 2).\nS0 checks moves:\na) $H_0'=(6, 2)$: Collision. Both die. Unlikely if S0 is rational.\nb) $H_0'=(5, 3)$: Safe. $H_1$ is alive, $H_0$ is alive. Next turn $H_1$ is at (6, 2), $H_0$ is at (5, 3). $H_1$ can try DOWN to (6, 1) or LEFT to (5, 2) (if $H_0$ moves away).\nc) $H_0'=(4, 2)$: S0 dies hitting $B_1$.\nd) $H_0'=(5, 1)$: S0 dies hitting $B_1$.\n\nIf S0 plays optimally to survive, it chooses (5, 3). S0 survives, $H_1$ survives, and $H_1$ moved significantly towards the upper-left quadrant where the action is. This seems like the best attacking posture.\n\nIf $H_1$ moves RIGHT (7, 1). S0 can safely move to (6, 2), gaining positional advantage over the apples, or stick near $H_1$'s previous position.\n\nGiven the goal of acquiring the proximate apples (1, 2) and (2, 2), moving UP seems necessary to engage the area where $H_0$ is currently located.\n\n**Chosen Move: UP to (6, 2)**\nThis forces S0 to either move defensively (to (5, 3)) or risk a collision. Even if S0 moves to (5, 3), $H_1$ is well-positioned to look for other paths/apples on the next turn, or pressure $H_0$.\n\nLong Term Plan: Directly approach the apple cluster around Y=2 by moving UP/LEFT. Since $H_0$ is controlling the main pathway near (5, 2), we will push into the (6, 2) row to force $H_0$ into a defensive reaction or a mutual kill scenario (which we want to avoid, but S0 initiates if it moves RIGHT). Assuming S0 plays defensively (moves to (5, 3)), we gain central positioning.\n\nUP",
