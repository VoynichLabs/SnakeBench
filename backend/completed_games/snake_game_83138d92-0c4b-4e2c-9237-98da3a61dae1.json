They are not in a position to collide with you this turn, so there\u2019s no head-on risk here.\n- You currently have no body, so there is no risk of self-collision. Moving DOWN is safe and keeps you progressing toward apples without trapping you immediately.\n- Other safe options exist (UP to (8,4), LEFT to (7,3), RIGHT to (9,3)), but they don\u2019t immediately yield an apple and may reduce your future options. Taking the apple now is the strongest immediate gain while staying open for future maneuvers.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After eating at (8,2), prioritize reaching centrally located apples (e.g., (3,3) or (6,7)) to stay away from the edges and avoid getting boxed in by the enemy.\n- Maintain flexibility by not over-committing to a single direction; keep branches open to dodge potential enemy advances.\n- Always scan for potential head-on collisions next turn and avoid moves that would place your head on the same cell as an enemy head.\n\nDOWN",
