No bodies there\n- DOWN to (3,6): Wait... (3,6) is empty but (3,5) has an apple. Still safe though!\n- LEFT to (2,7): Safe! Clear path\n- RIGHT to (4,7): UH OH! That's RIGHT where the enemy head is! If they don't move, we crash and lose. Too risky!\n\nSo RIGHT is OUT. We've got UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nDOWN puts us closer to that apple cluster but also closer to the edge.
