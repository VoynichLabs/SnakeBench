Who is he, some kind of casual? We're going to box this guy in, I promise you! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 0):**\nMy head is at (1, 7).\nOpponent's head (Snake #1) is at (3, 4).\nThe board is littered with apples! Opportunity knocks, chat! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Get to an apple safely, and keep an eye on our rival.\n\n**Apples Nearby:**\n*   (1, 8) - UP\n*   (0, 1) - Far DOWN/LEFT\n*   (1, 6) - DOWN\n*   (2, 1) - Far DOWN/RIGHT\n\nLet's look at the safe moves from (1, 7):\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):** This is an apple! Instant growth, instant score. Is it safe from the edge? Yes, (1, 8) is fine. Is it safe from the opponent? The opponent is far away at (3, 4). They can't reach me. This looks like the optimal first move.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** This is also an apple! Good move, but UP seems slightly better as it goes towards the top edge, giving us more room to maneuver initially.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** Empty space. Safe, but misses an apple. Why skip free content?\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Empty space. Safe, but misses an apple.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are apple moves! We love that. Let's maximize our positional advantage. Moving UP to (1, 8) secures the apple and puts us high on the board. The opponent is currently in the center-lower-right quadrant. We grab this high apple and then look to consolidate territory.\n\n**Rival Watch (Snake #1 at (3, 4)):**\nSnake #1 is near the apple at (5, 3) or (8, 4) or even (1, 4). They will likely move towards an apple to start their game. Our move doesn't interfere with them, which is perfect for maximizing initial score.\n\n**Decision:** Moving UP to (1, 8) is an easy choice. It's safe, it's an apple, and it establishes a strong position! Let's get that first point! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self):**\nGrab the (1, 8) apple. Next turn, we will be at (1, 8). We should consider moving RIGHT to (2, 8) or DOWN to (1, 7) to keep options open, depending on where the opponent goes. Our initial goal is to secure apples on the left side (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), and prevent Snake #1 from getting too close to our territory! Map control is key!\n\nUP",

We are sitting at **(3, 4)** while our rival, Snake #0, is chilling at **(1, 7)**. They think they're safe up there? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the options for our first legendary move:\n- **UP to (3, 5):** Moves us toward the top apples, but it\u2019s a bit of a journey.\n- **DOWN to (3, 3):** Gets us closer to the juice at (3, 0) and (5, 3).\n- **LEFT to (2, 4):** This is interesting! It puts us right next to the apple at (1, 4). \n- **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Moves us into center stage, but no immediate snacks there.\n\n**THE HYPER-STRAT:** \ud83e\udde0\nOur rival is at (1, 7). They have an apple right below them at (1, 6). If we go LEFT toward (2, 4), we are positioning ourselves to contest the entire left side of the board! If we snag (1, 4) early, we grow and start building that wall to BOX THEM IN! \ud83d\udce6 We need to control the space and make sure they have nowhere to slither! \n\nWait, look at (1, 4) and (1, 2). If I go Left now, I\u2019m pathing directly to a double-growth spurt! Let's get that early lead and start the snowball! We are playing for the long game, but we need that length to cut them off! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nSnake #0 is likely going for (1, 6). I\u2019m going to head towards (1, 4) then pivot DOWN to grab (1, 2) and (0, 1). This keeps me growing while maintaining a presence in the middle-left to prevent the rival from expanding downwards.

Did you see that? We are at (2, 4) and we are hungry for those apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude0b\n\nLet's look at the board, fam! Our rival, Snake #0, is sitting at (1, 8) with a body segment at (1, 7). They already got one apple\u2014can you believe the nerve?! \ud83d\ude44 They think they're leading? We\u2019re about to show them what a REAL gamer looks like!\n\n**EYES ON THE PRIZE:** \ud83c\udf4e\n- There is a JUICY apple right next to us at **(1, 4)**. \n- There's another one at **(0, 4)**.\n- If we keep heading left, we snag those two and start getting LONG! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE RIVAL WATCH:** \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nSnake #0 is at (1, 8). Their closest apples are (1, 6) and (0, 1). If they move DOWN to (1, 7), they're just following their own tail. If they move DOWN again to (1, 6), they are coming right for our territory. We need to claim the left wall FAST to make sure they have no room to breathe! \ud83d\ude24 \n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP to (2, 5):** No immediate snacks. We\u2019re not here for a hike, we\u2019re here to EAT!\n- **DOWN to (2, 3):** Moving away from the immediate apple at (1, 4). Not the vibe.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 4):** That's just going backwards to where we started. Chat, we don't retreat! We only advance! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT to (1, 4):** BINGO! That\u2019s an apple right there! It puts us at (1, 4), and then we can look at (0, 4) or (1, 2) next! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe take the apple at (1, 4) this turn. Next turn, we scan the situation. If the rival is still high up, we might pivot DOWN toward (1, 2) and (0, 1) to sweep the bottom-left corner and leave them with NOTHING! We are building the Wall of Greatness, and they aren't invited! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d \n\nStay hyped, stay focused! We're taking that apple and we're taking the lead!

The opponent is still sitting at zero, pathetic! \ud83e\udd23\n\nWe are currently at the head of content creation, literally at (1, 8), and our opponent (Snake #1) is still at (2, 4). They moved from (3, 4) to (2, 4) on the last turn, likely going for the apple cluster down there. Smart, but not smart enough!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (1, 8). Body: [(1, 7)]. Length: 2.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (2, 4). Body: none. Length: 1.\n\n**Goal:** Secure more apples, push Snake #1 away from the high-value corners, and start working on trapping them.\n\n**Safe Moves from (1, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 9):** Safe! It's empty space, puts us on the top edge. Good position.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** This is where our body currently is! **DANGER!** If we move into (1, 7), that spot is currently our body segment. However, because we are length 2, when the head moves, the tail segment at (1, 7) will actually follow to (1, 8), leaving (1, 7) *empty* by the time the head lands there, unless we ate an apple last turn (which we did). **WAIT!**\n    *   *Correction/Rule Check:* When we eat an apple, our tail DOES NOT shrink/move. The new tail remains where the old tail was, growing the snake by 1 segment.\n    *   Last turn, our body was just the tail at (1, 7). We moved to (1, 8) and ate an apple. Now our body is [(1, 7)].\n    *   If we move DOWN to (1, 7), we hit our own body segment! **DEATH TRAP!** \u274c (1, 7) is a kill move. Thanks, apples!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 8):** Safe! Empty space. Excellent position for the left wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe! Empty space. Good move towards the center/right. Note the apple at (9, 8).\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** DOWN (self-collision).\n\n**Rival Watch (Snake #1 at (2, 4)):**\nSnake #1 is currently staring at apples at (1, 4), (2, 4) (which they just landed on, so it's gone), (5, 3), (8, 4), and (2, 1). They want to grow.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (2, 4):\n*   UP to (2, 5) or DOWN to (2, 3) (empty).\n*   LEFT to (1, 4) (APPLE!).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 4) (empty).\n\nThey are most likely going for the (1, 4) apple by moving LEFT, or moving UP/DOWN to reposition. If they move LEFT to (1, 4), they are staying low.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation of MY Safe Moves:**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. We are secure and high up. We should use this advantage to control the top half of the board while Snake #1 messes around in the middle.\n\n*   **UP to (1, 9):** Good wall position. Next turn, we could move LEFT to (0, 9), or RIGHT to (2, 9). Very flexible.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 8):** Locks down the left side immediately. Next turn, we must move UP to (0, 9) (empty) or DOWN to (0, 7) (empty). This is slightly less flexible than UP, as it commits us to the wall sooner, but it's a valuable choke point if we want to run down the (0, X) column.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 8):** Moves us marginally closer to the giant cluster of apples on the right side if we continue right. However, it takes us away from the safe corner and might invite Snake #1 to come up and challenge us sooner than necessary.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 9) seems the most flexible, preparing us to either wrap across the top or drop down the edges, securing territory. It maintains maximum distance from Snake #1 right now.\n\n**Decision:** UP. We gain territory, maintain flexibility, and keep the pressure high! We are not going for an immediate apple, but setting up for the (9, 8) or (8, 7) run later. Control the map first! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self):**\nWe are boxing out Snake #1 by securing the top-left quadrant first. If we move UP to (1, 9), next turn we should aim to move LEFT to (0, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 9). If Snake #1 continues to hug the bottom half, we will descend the left wall (0, X) or the right wall (9, X) to secure more apples and cut the board in half.\n\nUP",

Our tail is at (2, 4).\nThe rival, Snake #0, is at (1, 9) moving... somewhere.

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, we're back in the arena! Turn 2, and we are absolutely dominating the map dynamics. Look at this board state!\n\nWe are the king of the North at (1, 9)! Our body is long and strong at (1, 8). Snake #1 is still clowning around down at (1, 4) with their little two-segment body [(2, 4)]. They clearly scored an apple! Well played, I guess, but we\u2019re still higher up on the leaderboard! Score 1-1. This is getting spicy! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n\n### CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 2)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (1, 9). Body: [(1, 8)]. Length: 2.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (1, 4). Body: [(2, 4)]. Length: 2. (They ate an apple, probably the one at (1, 4) as predicted!)\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (1, 4))\n\nSnake #1 just ate the apple at (1, 4). They are now sitting on the left wall. Where are they going next?\n\nNearby apples:\n1.  (0, 1) - DOWN/LEFT path.\n2.  (5, 3) - RIGHT/UP path.\n3.  (8, 4) - FAR RIGHT path.\n4.  (2, 1) - DOWN/RIGHT path.\n\nGiven they are at (1, 4), their safe moves are UP (1, 5), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4 - into their own body *unless* their body moves next turn, which it does), or DOWN (1, 3). Wait!\n\n*   **Snake #1 Body Segments:** (2, 4) is the tail which will move to (1, 4) if they move to (1, 5).\n*   If Snake #1 moves:\n    *   UP to (1, 5): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (1, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (0, 4): Apple! (Wait, the board shows A at (0, 4). Let's check the board state.)\n        *   Board at (0, 4) is 'A'. YES! They are going for the (0, 4) apple by moving LEFT.\n    *   RIGHT to (2, 4): This is currently their TAIl. Since they are length 2, the tail will vacate (2, 4) and move to (1, 4). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (2, 4) is SAFE!\n\nSnake #1 has a goldmine down there. I predict they go for the (0, 4) apple (move LEFT) or the (2, 4) empty spot (move RIGHT) to prepare for the (5, 3) or (8, 4) area. The most aggressive play is LEFT to (0, 4).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT to (0, 4), they start running the left wall downwards.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (1, 9))\n\nWe want to secure the top edge and use our size to cut them off. We are positioned perfectly to run the perimeter.\n\nPossible moves from (1, 9):\n\n1.  **UP:** Out of bounds! \u274c **DEATH TRAP!**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** Into our own body! \u274c **DEATH TRAP!** (Our body is at (1, 8) and since we are length 2, it won't move out fast enough).\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):** Safe! Great edge control move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** Safe! Great edge control move.\n\nTwo safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT. Which is better, CHAT?\n\n#### Option A: LEFT to (0, 9)\n\n**Pro:** Locks down the top-left corner. Sets us up to run down the (0, X) edge, securing the left half. We can drop down and hit the (0, 4) apple later if Snake #1 doesn't get it first, or (0, 1) which is currently a high priority apple. Maintains maximum distance from Snake #1's predicted movements in the center/bottom.\n**Con:** The apple cluster is mostly on the right side of the board (e.g., (9, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)). Moving left takes us away from that immediate cluster.\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT to (2, 9)\n\n**Pro:** Moves us towards the high-value apple cluster on the right. Better long-term potential for scoring.\n**Con:** It slightly delays securing that crucial top-left corner choke point (0, 9).\n\n### STRATEGY EVALUATION: Perimeter Control & Apple Rush\n\nOur initial strategy was to secure territory and then funnel down. Snake #1 is clearly committed to the low-X row. If we secure the top-left corner first by moving LEFT to (0, 9), we can then run UP/DOWN the (0, X) column, creating an impassable barrier.\n\nHowever, the RIGHT side is APPLE country. We need to score fast to pull ahead. The apples at (9, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6) are undefended and massive content potential. Moving RIGHT to (2, 9) starts that aggressive push.\n\nLet's look ahead.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (0, 9): Next turn, we must move DOWN to (0, 8), which is currently empty space. Then we can go for (0, 4) and (0, 1). This is a safe containment route.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (2, 9): Next turn, we can move RIGHT again to (3, 9) (Apple!) or UP to (2, 8). Wait, (3, 9) is an apple! We secure a point immediately on Turn 3! This is the most aggressive and rewarding move.\n\nLet's confirm the apple (3, 9):\n 9 . 0 . A . . . . . . <--- YES. (3, 9) is an Apple ('A').\n\n**The Tactic:** Rush the top wall for (3, 9) and then continue right towards (9, 8). This establishes us as the alpha snake on the high ground and ensures we secure the next point.\n\n**Move Sequence:**\n1.  **Turn 2: RIGHT to (2, 9).**\n2.  **Turn 3: RIGHT to (3, 9) (APPLE!).**\n3.  **Turn 4: RIGHT to (4, 9).**\n4.  ... Continuing the top wall sweep to (9, 9) and then dropping down for (9, 8).\n\nSnake #1 is busy on the bottom, so we have free reign up here. Let's maximize our score advantage before they notice we're cleaning up the map!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self):\nWe are executing the sweep across the top wall to secure the massive cluster of apples on the right side ((3, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), etc.). Our priority is scoring and growing. Snake #1 is deep in the low rows; as long as we maintain distance and grow faster, we can eventually descend and trap them when we are bigger. Focus on securing (3, 9) next turn. The move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

They're trying to play the high ground, but we own the streets!\n\n**THE MOVE EVALUATION:** \ud83e\udde0\n- **LEFT:** CRASH! (0, 4) to (-1, 4) is out of bounds! We aren't ending the stream early, chat! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** NOPE! That's moving back into our own neck at (1, 4). Instant L.

Body: [(1, 9)]. Length: 2.\n*   The board updated: (1, 9) is now T (tail), (2, 9) is 0 (head).

Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4)]. Length: 3. They ate the apple!\n*   Scoreboard confirms: ID 1 now has 2 apples.\n\nThey are doing exactly what I expected: running the left-hand column.

Keeps them running the wall towards (0, 1) apple.\n3.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Into their own body segment! \u274c (Since they just ate, their body at (1, 4) will *not* vacate this turn).\n\nThey are going to move UP or DOWN the column. Given the apple at (0, 1) and the high density of apples further away from the top wall, I predict they favor **DOWN** to (0, 3) to secure the left side.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (2, 9))\n\nWe are positioned at (2, 9). Our next target is the highly-prized apple at **(3, 9)**! This is a slam dunk acquisition!\n\nPossible moves from (2, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):** Out of bounds! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** Safe. Moves us away from the apple; not preferred.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Into our own tail/body! \u274c (Since we just grew into (2, 9), (1, 9) is still part of the body and will move to (2, 9) only if we *don't* eat. But even if we eat, (1, 9) is occupied by a segment that turns into the new tail *if* we don't eat. Wait, since we are moving into an apple, our tail (1, 9) stays put! So moving LEFT is **DEADLY!**\n    *   *Rethink:* My body is [(1, 9)]. If I go LEFT to (1, 9), I hit my body. Unless I'm currently length 1, moving directly into the body segment behind the head is always fatal. We are length 2. **DEATH TRAP!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** APPLE! This is a guaranteed score, and it's a safe move into an empty spot. LETS GOOO! \u2705\n\nThe plan is simple, CHAT: **GIMME THAT APPLE!**\n\n### STRATEGY FOR TURN 3: Aggressive Northern Expansion\n\nWe need to secure this apple at (3, 9) and continue our sweep across the top. This will be our second apple, tying the score 2-2. Then we can push for the cluster of apples on the right (9, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6).\n\nBy staying on the top edge, we establish a psychological advantage\u2014we control the high ground! Snake #1 is stuck in the low rows for now. Our goal is to grow long and then swoop down and box them in.\n\n**Move Sequence Lookahead:**\n1.  **Turn 3 (NOW): RIGHT to (3, 9) (APPLE!).** New head: (3, 9). New body: [(2, 9), (1, 9)]. Length: 3.\n2.  **Turn 4: UP/RIGHT/DOWN?** From (3, 9), we can safely move RIGHT to (4, 9), continuing the top perimeter rush.\n3.  **Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 9).**\n4.  ... We continue the movement until we hit (9, 9) and grab (9, 8).\n\nThis is a clean, low-risk path to dominance. We execute the plan!\n\nRIGHT",

Now it's time to maintain the advantage and dominate this top row!\n\n### BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 4 / 150)\n\nMy Head (ID 0): (3, 9). Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9)]. Length: 3.\nOpponent #1 Head: (0, 3). Body: [(0, 4), (1, 4)]. Length: 3.\n\n**Apples Remaining:** (0, 1), (9, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (8, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 6), (1, 6), (1, 2), (3, 7), (7, 2), (3, 1). That's 15 apples still out there!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (0, 3))\n\nLast turn, Snake #1 moved from (0, 4) DOWN to (0, 3). They are clearly focusing on the left wall to grab the apple at (0, 1). This is exactly what we want, CHAT! Keep them locked down there.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 at (0, 3):\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):** Into their own body segment! \u274c (Body is starting at (0, 4)). DEATH TRAP!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):** Safe, and moves toward the (0, 1) apple. **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n3.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Safe, but moves them away from the immediate apple and into open territory. Less likely for now.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (0, 2) to continue the charge toward (0, 1).\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (3, 9))\n\nWe are sitting pretty at (3, 9). We just grew, which means our body segments are tightly packed [(2, 9), (1, 9)]. We need to keep traveling the top edge and push toward that cluster of high-value apples (9, 8), (8, 7), etc.\n\nPossible moves from (3, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** Out of bounds! \u274c DEATH AHEAD!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Safe. Moves us off the wall, but keeps options open.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** Into our own body segment! \u274c Hitting ourselves means hitting the segment directly behind the head. FATALITY!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** Safe. Continues the perimeter run. \u2705\n\nThe decision is clear, CHAT. We must continue the **Top Wall Rush** to get to the eastern side! Moving RIGHT to (4, 9) is the cleanest, safest, and most strategic move to secure future territory and apples.\n\n### Strategy: The Northern Perimeter Sweep\n\nWe need to get long! The longer we are, the better we can box the opponent in later.\n\n**Goal for the next few turns:**\n1.  **Turn 4 (NOW): RIGHT to (4, 9).**\n2.  **Turn 5: RIGHT to (5, 9).**\n3.  **Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 9).**\n4.  **Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 9).**\n5.  **Turn 8: RIGHT to (8, 9).**\n6.  **Turn 9: RIGHT to (9, 9).**\n7.  **Turn 10: DOWN to (9, 8) (APPLE!).**\n\nThis multi-turn plan guarantees high-value apples while establishing solid control over the northern and eastern map borders. Snake #1 is stuck fighting for the low-value corner apples, giving us crucial length and positioning. We secure the high ground!\n\nWe execute the plan, CHAT! We go RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

This is the only move that makes sense, securing them another point and putting pressure on us. **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n3.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):** Safe, but they ignore the apple. Very unlikely.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (0, 1) to eat the apple. Score likely becomes 3-2 (them-us).\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (4, 9))\n\nWe are sitting pretty at (4, 9). We are marching along the top wall. Time to continue the Northern Perimeter Sweep!\n\nPossible moves from (4, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** Out of bounds! \u274c DEATH AHEAD!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** Safe. Moves us off the wall. We don't want to bail on the perimeter yet.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** Into our own body segment! \u274c FATALITY!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Safe. Keeps us moving strategically along the top edge. \u2705 This sets us up perfectly for the high-value apples on the right side.\n\n### Decision Rationale: Maintain the Push!\n\nThe long-term plan is still solid. We let the opponent waste time fighting for low-value corner apples while we leverage our central-top position to seize the right half of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Check:**\n1.  Turn 5 (NOW): **RIGHT to (5, 9).**\n2.  Turn 6: RIGHT to (6, 9).\n3.  Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 9).\n4.  Turn 8: RIGHT to (8, 9).\n5.  Turn 9: RIGHT to (9, 9).\n6.  Turn 10: DOWN to (9, 8) (APPLE!).\n\nThis sweep keeps us safe, keeps our options open, and leads directly to an apple while securing prime territory. If the opponent gets the (0, 1) apple this turn, we'll be 2-3, but we'll soon catch up and surpass them by taking the (9, 8) apple and the cluster below it!\n\nWe are going RIGHT, CHAT! Securing the perimeter!\n\n**Strategy for Next Steps:** We maintain the Northern Perimeter Sweep, moving right until we reach the corner (9, 9), then we drop down for the apple at (9, 8). This builds length and secures the entire eastern flank before the opponent can respond.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s our own body! We aren't trying to do a 360-no-scope on ourselves! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** (-1, 2) - THAT'S THE VOID! We'd fall off the map and the stream would go dark!

We want the gains! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 2) - THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!

It\u2019s a literal buffet! \ud83c\udf74\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udd4a\nWe are going **DOWN**! By moving to (1, 1), we position ourselves right in the middle of a four-apple cluster. While Snake #0 is stuck in the nosebleeds at the top of the map, we are going to clear out the entire south-west sector. Our goal is to hit length 6 or 7 before they even cross the mid-line.

My GGs to the enemy for snagging that apple, but don't worry, we are building up for a massive power spike!\n\n### BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 6 / 150)\n\nMy Head (ID 0): (5, 9). Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9)]. Length: 3.\nOpponent #1 Head: (1, 2). Body: [(0, 2), (0, 3)]. Length: 3. (Wait, they moved to (1, 2)? Let's re-analyze.)\n\n**Hold up, CHAT!** Let's check the opponent's move from Turn 5.\n\n*   Turn 5: Opponent #1 was at (0, 2). Their tail was (0, 4). Length 3.\n*   I predicted they would move DOWN to (0, 1) to eat the apple there.\n*   The actual resulting state: Opponent's Head is at (1, 2). Body is [(0, 2), (0, 3)]. Length is 3.\n\n**WHAT?!** Snake #1 moved **RIGHT** from (0, 2) to (1, 2) and completely ignored the juicy apple at (0, 1) and the one at (2, 1)! This is highly unusual behavior! Snake #1 did NOT grow, meaning they did not eat an apple, and yet the scoreboard shows they have 3 apples.\n\nLet's look at the Apple Drops list and the Board State to reconcile this.\n\n**Apples Remaining:** (0, 1), (9, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (8, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 6), (1, 6), (3, 7), (7, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2).\n\n**Board State:**\n 9 . . . T T 0 . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . A\n 7 . . . A . . . . A .\n 6 . A . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 T . . . . . . . A .\n 3 T . . . . A . . A .\n 2 T 1 . A . . . A . .\n 1 A . A A . . . . . A\n 0 . . . A . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe coordinates for the body segments in the list are correct: `Body: [(0, 2), (0, 3)]`.\n\nWait, the Apple Drop list had a typo in the previous turn and listed (1, 2) as an apple. Let's look at the current Board State: there is **NO APPLE** at (1, 2).\nThe apple that *was* at (0, 1) is still there. The apples at (2, 1) and (3, 1) are there.\n\n**RECONCILIATION:** The provided game status *must* be correct. Snake #1 moved RIGHT from (0, 2) to (1, 2), ignoring the apple. Their length is 3, their apples are 3. This means they ate an apple on a previous turn that I missed in my manual reconstruction, OR the simulation handled the opponent's tail position and growth differently than expected. We must proceed with the current state as gospel! (1, 2) is the Opponent Head.\n\nOpponent #1 is at (1, 2). We are at (5, 9).\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (1, 2))\n\nSnake #1 is now centralized near the bottom. They have many apples around them, including (0, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 1).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 at (1, 2):\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the apples. Unlikely.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Leads towards (0, 1) or (2, 1) which are close.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Into their own body segment (which is now their tail)! \u274c WAIT, no. (0, 2) is their tail segment. Moving onto the spot their tail just vacated is SAFE unless they grow. They did not grow this turn, so moving to (0, 2) is safe. This takes them back towards the (0, 1) apple. **LIKELY.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe. This sets them up for (2, 1) or the cluster around (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2). **VERY LIKELY.**\n\nGiven their aggressive move to (1, 2), they likely want to continue moving into the open board space. Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) is the most proactive move to secure the central bottom cluster.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (2, 2).\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (5, 9))\n\nWe are at (5, 9). We are executing the Northern Perimeter Sweep. We have momentum! We need to continue exploiting the high ground.\n\nPossible moves from (5, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** Out of bounds! \u274c DEATH SCROLL!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Safe. If we bail now, we lose perimeter control.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Into our own body segment! \u274c INSTA-DEATH!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Safe. Continues the sweep towards the (9, 8) apple! \u2705\n\n### Decision Rationale: Stick to the Plan!\n\nCHAT, the opponent is bogged down in the bottom-left quadrant. This is our chance to build critical length and secure the entire right side of the map! If we move DOWN now, we let them potentially sneak up the right wall unchallenged.\n\nThe plan holds:\n\n1.  Turn 6 (NOW): **RIGHT to (6, 9).**\n2.  Turn 7: RIGHT to (7, 9).\n3.  Turn 8: RIGHT to (8, 9).\n4.  Turn 9: RIGHT to (9, 9).\n5.  Turn 10: DOWN to (9, 8) (APPLE!).\n\nThis looks like a flawless, safe path to our next apple, and it keeps us completely out of the opponent's way for the next five turns. We are maximizing safety and territorial control. We will be tied 3-3 after Turn 10, but with amazing map position!\n\nWe are going RIGHT! Securing the flank!\n\n**Strategy for Next Steps:** Continue the Northern Perimeter Sweep. The opponent is tunneling for small gains, we are making big moves for the map domination!\n\nRIGHT",

We aren't trying to do the \"self-sabotage\" challenge today! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (0, 1) - **APPLE SPOTTED!** Moving to (0, 1) gives us a point and makes us length 5.

Let's check the scoreboard\u2014still trailing 2-3, but not for long! We're coming for that $9, 8$ apple!\n\n### BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 7 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0): (6, 9).** Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9)]. Length: 3.\n*   **Opponent #1 Head: (1, 1).** Body: [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. Length: 4. (OH SHIT. They grew!)\n*   Board Size: $10 \\times 10$.\n\n**HOLD UP, CHAT!** The opponent grew! How did they get from (1, 2) to (1, 1) and increase their length from 3 to 4?\n\n1.  **Previous Turn (Turn 6):** Head was at (1, 2). Tail was at (0, 3). Length 3.\n2.  **Current Result (Turn 7):** Head is at (1, 1). Tail is at (0, 3). Length 4.\n    *   This means they moved **DOWN** to (1, 1) and ate the apple that was at (1, 1)!\n    *   Wait a minute... let's check the Apple list: `(0, 1), (9, 1), (5, 3), (9, 8), (8, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 6), (1, 6), (3, 7), (7, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)`.\n    *   **THERE WAS NO APPLE AT (1, 1)!**\n\n**Rethink!** Look at the new Board State visualization!\n\n 9 . . . .

A . .\n 1 A 1 A A . . . . . A\n 0 . . . A . . . . . .\n\nThe **Board State** shows:\n*   (0, 1) has an apple (A).\n*   (1, 1) has the Opponent Head (1).\n*   (2, 1) has an apple (A).\n*   (3, 1) has an apple (A).\n*   (9, 1) has an apple (A).\n\nThe opponent must have moved DOWN from (1, 2) to (1, 1). If they grew, they must have eaten an apple at (1, 1). The board state explicitly shows their head is *on* (1, 1) and the previous turn recap showed they had 3 apples, and now the new scoreboard shows they still have 3 apples.\n\n**CONFUSION ALERT!** Snake 1's head is at (1, 1). They have 3 apples. Their length is 4. This implies they ate an apple on a *previous* turn where I assumed they didn't, or the game is being tricky. I must trust the provided L/W status: they are length 4, and their apple count is 3. They did *not* eat an apple this turn. They moved UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT to (1, 1). From (1, 2), they moved **DOWN** to (1, 1).\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (1, 1))\n\nThe opponent is now locked into the bottom left corner, surrounded by apples at (0, 1), (2, 1), and a cluster at the (3, X) column. They are getting dangerously long and need to find space.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 at (1, 1):\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Safe. Moves back onto their body's last position. This is a common move in tight spots.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe. This sets them up for (3, 0) or circling back. **LIKELY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** **APPLE!** Massive incentive. This is the **MOST LIKELY** move. If they move here, they get +1 length and are now length 5, score 4 points.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** **APPLE!** Also massive incentive. They may aim for the (3, 1) cluster.\n\nIf they prioritize the immediate nearest apple, they go to (0, 1) or (2, 1). Both are highly attractive. If they go to (0, 1), they trap themselves in the corner a bit, but get the treat. If they go to (2, 1), they move towards the center where there is more room.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **LEFT** to (0, 1) to eat the apple.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (6, 9))\n\nWe are still executing the Northern Perimeter Sweep. We are at (6, 9). The opponent is far away, so we have full control of our movements.\n\nPlan: **RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN (Apple)**.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** Out of bounds. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe. Abandoning the sweep. Not ideal.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** Into our own body (tail just vacated). Safe, but reverses our progress. No!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Safe. Continues the sweep. Sets us up perfectly for the next step. \u2705\n\n### Decision Rationale: Flawless Execution\n\nCHAT, we need to stay focused! The opponent is scavenging, but we are executing an expansion strategy. Every step we take to the right brings us closer to map control and the precious (9, 8) apple.\n\n**Current Move:** **RIGHT to (7, 9)**.\n\n**Future Plan:**\n*   Turn 8: RIGHT to (8, 9).\n*   Turn 9: RIGHT to (9, 9).\n*   Turn 10: DOWN to (9, 8) (APPLE! Tie game 4-4, L=4).\n*   Turn 11: Continue moving South down the right wall.\n\nWe are staying on track, maximizing safety, and expanding our territory. This is how you win tournaments, boys! We don't care about the bottom feeder apples right now. We're going for the main course!\n\nRIGHT",

They are way up in the nosebleeds while we're down here in the VIP lounge!\n\n**THE MOVE EVALUATION:** \ud83e\udde0\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 1) - **BACKWARDS!** Chat, if I do this, I\u2019m getting banned from my own stream! Moving back into your own neck is a total rookie mistake. \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP:** (2, 2) - It\u2019s safe, but it doesn't get us a snack immediately. We want that sugar rush! \ud83c\udf6c\n*   **DOWN:** (2, 0) - Takes us towards the edge. Why go to the basement when the buffet is on the main floor? \ud83d\udcc9\n*   **RIGHT:** (3, 1) - **JACKPOT!** There is an apple sitting right there at (3, 1)! If we go RIGHT, we hit 5 apples! \ud83c\udf4e And look at the map\u2014there's another one at (3, 2) and (3, 0). We are literally surrounded by points!\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udd4a\nWe are going **RIGHT** to hit (3, 1)! This is a no-brainer!

Every apple we eat is one they can't have. We are starving them out while we bulk up! If we get (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 0), it\u2019s basically GG.

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! What is the sit-rep? Turn 8! We are back in the Northern Command Center. We're at (7, 9). That last move to (7, 9) was *perfection*. We are locked onto that (9, 8) apple. Let's check the scoreboard anxiety\u2014they're still ahead! 4 to 2! We NEED this apple!\n\n### BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 8 / 150)\n\n| Coordinate | Contents |\n| :--------- | :------- |\n| My Head    | (7, 9)   |\n| My Body    | [(6, 9), (5, 9)] |\n| My Length  | 3        |\n| Snake #1 Head | (2, 1) |\n| Snake #1 Body | [(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)] |\n| Snake #1 Length | 5 (They just grew!) |\n\n**HOLD UP!** The scoreboard shows Snake #1 is at 4 apples. My length list update on the head is (2, 1). Let\u2019s check the coordinates again.\n\n*   **Turn 7 (My previous analysis):** Snake #1 Head was (1, 1). Length 4. Apples 3.\n*   **Turn 8 (Current State):** Snake #1 Head is (2, 1). Length 5. Apples 4.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENED?**\nSnake #1 moved from (1, 1) to (2, 1) and ATE the apple at (2, 1)!\n*   New Head: (2, 1).\n*   New Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. (Tail is still (0, 3) because they grew).\n*   This was a great, aggressive move by my rival. They are now long and centered in the bottom-left!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (2, 1))\n\nThe rival snake is now length 5 and blocking a major choke point. They are surrounded by apples at (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 0), and (0, 1). They are greedy!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 at (2, 1):\n1.  **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe. Moves toward the (3, 0) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** Into their own body (tail element just vacated, but this is the previous head position). This is **ALWAYS SAFE** but gives up momentum.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** **APPLE!** This is the strongest incentive. They snag another point and get longer.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT to (3, 1)** to secure another apple. This puts them at 5 apples and length 6. If they do that, they are getting dangerously close to boxing in the bottom right, and they will own the vertical lane at X=3.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (7, 9))\n\nWe are still executing the North-East Expansion Plan. We are far from danger (a 6-turn head start, roughly). We must acquire that high-value (9, 8) apple to tie the game.\n\nObjective: (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8) [EAT!]\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 10):** \u274c DEAD (Out of bounds). Don't mess up the coordinates, CHAT!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe. Abandoning the wall sweep. No!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 9):** Into our own body. **It's a backwards move!** The body segment is (6, 9). \u274c DEAD. (Wait, the body segment (6, 9) is the *last* segment, so it *will* vacate. But moving backwards is generally suicide if the body doesn't vacate. Since this spot IS (6, 9), the body segment *will* move to (5, 9) and (5, 9) will move to (4, 9) and the tail at (5, 9) will move to (4, 9). The tail is (5, 9). If I move LEFT, (6, 9) is now the head. (5, 9) is still the tail. **The cell (6, 9) is the second segment of my snake.** Moving into it is **INSTANT DEATH** unless it's the tail cell, which it is *not*. If I was at (6, 8) and my body was [(7, 8), (8, 8)], moving into (7, 8) is safe. But my body is [(6, 9), (5, 9)]. Moving back to (6, 9) is moving into a non-tail segment. **INSTA-KILL.** \u274c)\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Safe. Continues the path. Puts us in position for the next move. \u2705\n\n**Recap on Safety:**\nCurrent position: (7, 9). Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9)].\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 9), I hit the first body segment. If the snake moves simultaneously, the segment at (6, 9) moves to (5, 9), and the segment at (5, 9) moves off the board (or its tail is cut off). Since I am only length 3, if I move RIGHT, the head is (8, 9), body is (7, 9), tail is (6, 9). The space (6, 9) is open. But if I move LEFT, the snake tries to move into (6, 9) which is instantaneously occupied by a body segment *before* the body moves. **Collision with non-tail body segments is an instant loss.** Blocked.\n\nThe only safe and progressive move is **RIGHT**.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nWe proceed with the wall sweep strategy:\n1.  **Turn 8 (Now):** Move **RIGHT** to (8, 9).\n2.  **Turn 9:** Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9).\n3.  **Turn 10:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 8) to eat the apple. (Score 3, Length 4).\n4.  **Turn 11-15:** Continue down the right wall, aiming for the (9, 1) apple and then the center. The North quadrant is OURS!\n\nThis is how we guarantee the clutch comeback! We are too far away for Snake #1 to interfere, so safety is 100%. Maximum momentum!\n\nRIGHT",

Length 3.\n*   **Target Apple:** (9, 8) \u2014 this is the $1000 bounty!\n\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (3, 1).\n*   **Rival Body:** [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. Length 6.\n*   **Score:** They are ahead 5-2! That move to (3, 1) to eat the apple at (3, 1) was predicted and executed perfectly by them. They are now long and blocking the central vertical X=3 line.\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (3, 1))\n\nSnake #1 is long and greedy. They just ate an apple at (3, 1). They need to decide where to go next.\nAvailable apples nearby: (3, 0), (5, 1), (7, 2), (3, 2).\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (3, 1):\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** **APPLE!** Massive incentive. This secures the next score and puts them at length 7, further cementing their control over X=3. This is the most likely power move.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** **APPLE!** Also a strong incentive, but closer to the edge. They have a free path to it. This keeps their body away from the middle board.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** Moving into their own body (previous head position). Safe, but boring. Unlikely they give up an immediate apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Moves toward the (5, 1) apple, opening up the central lanes.\n\nPrediction: The rival will go for the vertical apples they are boxing in. Given their body is trailing back at Y=1 and Y=2, moving **UP to (3, 2)** gives them maximum flexibility up the center, heading toward that (5, 3) apple and maybe the (8, 3) apple later. Let's assume they move UP to (3, 2) and score.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (8, 9))\n\nWe are far away, executing our plan. Isolation is key to victory right now, CHAT! We must secure the perimeter!\n\nObjective: (8, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 8) [EAT!]\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 10):** \u274c DEAD (Out of bounds). We don't make those mistakes!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe. But it's not the fastest route to the (9, 8) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9):** Into the body. The segment at (7, 9) is NOT the tail (6, 9). \u274c DEAD. No moving backwards!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):** Safe. Puts us exactly one move away from the apple. This is the calculated aggressive path! \u2705\n\nThis move is 100% safe. There's no way Snake #1 can reach us, even if they tried to run across the map. We maximize our speed to the next objective!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nWe proceed with the wall sweep strategy:\n1.  **Turn 9 (Now):** Move **RIGHT** to (9, 9). (Set up).\n2.  **Turn 10:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 8) to eat the apple. (Score 3, Length 4, HUGE momentum boost).\n3.  **Turn 11:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 7).\n4.  **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 6).\n5.  **Target:** (9, 1) apple. We are going to lock down the entire East wall. We use our length to dominate the periphery before moving into the center to BOX THEM IN! Let's get this done!\n\nWe are going for the gold, CHAT!\nRIGHT",

There's a juicy cluster nearby: (5, 3) is calling our name, (3, 0) is right below us, and (5, 1) is ripe for the picking. Snake #0 is so far away they'd need a flight segment to reach us.\n\n**THE MOVES:** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n*   **UP:** (3, 3) - Safe, moves us toward the apples at (5, 3) and (3, 7) later.

If they ever try to come down, they're going to see a 10-foot thick wall of SNAKE! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nGrab (5, 3) or (5, 1) next.

Leads toward the unused lower left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves slightly toward the (5, 3) apple.\n\nPrediction: They are greedy and want to maintain that central control. Going **UP to (3, 3)** is the most aggressive and strategically sound move for them to dominate the Y-axis. Let's assume they move UP to (3, 3).

This long snake #1 is moving up the middle. They are going to get longer and longer. By building the wall, we are creating a contained perimeter for them.

We're closing the gap!\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 11 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (9, 8). Length 4! Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)].\n*   **Target:** Keep building that Eastern wall, securing the bottom right corner! The next apple is miles away, so pure positioning is key!\n*   **Board State Reflection:** Snake #1 is sitting deep in the lower center, massive and imposing. We are isolated and growing!\n\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (4, 2). *Wait, they MOVED!*\n*   **Rival Body:** [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. Length 8! (They ate the (7, 2) apple? NO, they didn't touch it. They went from (3, 2) to (4, 2). They must have eaten the (5, 1) apple on the previous turn, and then the (7, 2) apple is still there. Wait, no. Let's recheck the move from Turn 10.)\n\n*Last turn, Snake #1 was at (3, 2). Now they are at (4, 2).*\n(3, 2) to (4, 2) is a RIGHT move. They are now moving toward the center-right. They are hunting the (5, 3) and (8, 3) apples. Their body is long and stretching out along Y=1, Y=2 and X=3. They are consolidating their power base!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (4, 2)) - The Rival is on the MOVE!\n\nSnake #1 must move to maintain momentum and keep scoring.\nAvailable apples nearby: (5, 3), (7, 2), (8, 3).\n(7, 2) looks like an easy target.\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (4, 2):\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** Safe. Leads toward (5, 3). Strong contender.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** Towards the (5, 1) area, but their body is dense here. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** Into their own body (the previous head position, still part of the body). \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 2) apple. Very strong contender.\n\nPrediction: They want the apples. Moving **RIGHT to (5, 2)** puts them one step closer to (7, 2) and (5, 3). It also starts to expand their territory horizontally.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (9, 8)) - Building the Wall, One Section at a Time!\n\nWe are at (9, 8). The strategy is simple: go down to (9, 7). We are far from Snake #1, so collision risk is zero. We are focused on future board control!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** Into the body (the previous tail segment is still there). \u274c DEAD. We don't rewind!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** Safe. Continues the wall construction. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** Safe. Opens up the option for crossing the top half, but abandons the wall plan. Less ideal for now.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 8):** \u274c DEAD (Out of bounds).\n\nOnly two safe moves, but **DOWN** is the strategic choice. We must keep pressing the advantage on the boundary!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note: The Eastern Blockade\n\nWe need to secure the right side of the board (X=9 column) completely. This limits Snake #1's massive length from expanding East and forces them to coil up in the center-left.\n\n*   **Turn 11 (Now):** Move **DOWN** to (9, 7). (Length 4).\n*   **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 6). (Positioning for the corner).\n*   **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 5).\n*   **Turn 14:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 4).\n*   **Turn 15:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 3).\n*   **Turn 16:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 2).\n*   **Turn 17:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 1) and **EAT!** (Score 4, Length 5).\n\nOnce we hit (9, 1), we can cut across the bottom or start heading back UP through the center. Chat, we are playing chess while they are playing checkers! Consistency is key!\n\nDOWN",

We are sitting at 6 apples, Snake #0 is stuck at 3, and we are literally chilling in the VIP lounge while they're lost in the nosebleed sections! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 \n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **Our Head:** (5, 2) - Center stage, baby!\n*   **Our Body:** [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)] - Look at that tail trailing behind us like a cape!\n*   **Rival #0:** Head at (9, 7). They are finally starting to move south, but it's too little, too late!\n\n**LOCAL SCAN & SNACK OPPORTUNITIES:** \ud83c\udf4e\nWe are surrounded by glory! \n- (5, 3) is right above us.\n- (5, 1) is right below us.\n- (7, 2) is just two steps to the right.\n- (6, 1) is diagonal south-east.\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 2) - **CLOWN MOVE!** That's our own body. If I hit that, I\u2019m retiring from streaming forever. Absolute throw! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **UP:** (5, 3) - **JACKPOT!** We move directly onto an apple. This brings us to 7 apples and keeps us moving toward the center-top where even more loot awaits.\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 1) - **ANOTHER JACKPOT!** This also bags an apple. It keeps us near the bottom edge.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 2) - Safe, and sets us up to grab (7, 2), but why wait to eat when there's food right here?!\n\n**THE TACTICAL PLAY:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe are going **UP** to (5, 3). Why UP instead of DOWN? Check the map, chat! By going UP to (5, 3), we are positioning ourselves to potentially cut off Snake #0 if they dare to come down the middle of the board. We stay mobile, we get the growth, and we keep the pressure on. Snake #0 is at (9, 7) \u2013 they're nowhere near our buffet. We\u2019re going to hit 30 apples before they even figure out how to navigate! \n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nAfter grabbing (5, 3), we can pivot toward (5, 1) or (7, 2) depending on where the rival slithers. We are building a massive wall in the middle of the board. If they try to cross, they're getting boxed in! Let's get that 7th apple! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

We are behind, but we are positioned for a monster comeback!\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 12 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (9, 7). Length 4! Body: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. We own the corner!\n*   **Target:** Continue the Southern push along the X=9 wall! The apple at (9, 1) is waiting for us!\n*   **Board State Reflection:** Snake #1 is consolidating *hard* in the middle-left. They look massive and bulky.\n\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (5, 2).\n*   **Rival Body:** [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)]. Length 7! Wait, they *must* have eaten an apple moving from (4, 2) to (5, 2) this turn! The body is now length 7, and they were length 6 just before this turn! Which apple did they grab?\n\nLet's check the board from the *previous* turn (Turn 11, after my move to (9, 7) was confirmed):\nThe apple at (7, 2)? No, they are at (5, 2).\nThe apple at (5, 3)? Maybe, if they went from (4, 2) to (5, 2), they didn't touch it.\n\nWait, let's look at the apple list: (5, 1) was an apple drop.\nIf Snake #1 was at (4, 2) and moved RIGHT to (5, 2), they did not eat the (5, 1) or (7, 2).\n\n**Rethink the Turn 11 outcome:**\nIf I was at (9, 8) and moved DOWN to (9, 7).\nIf Snake #1 was at (4, 2), and they moved RIGHT to (5, 2).\nIf their length increased, they must have moved *onto* an apple.\nNo listed apple at (5, 2).\n**AH! The Board State shows (7, 2) is now empty.**\n\n*   *Turn 10 end:* Snake #1 at (3, 2). Length 7. (They must have eaten one on Turn 9).\n*   *Turn 11 move (MY PREDICTION):* Snake #1 at (4, 2). Length 7. (They moved RIGHT, no apple).\n*   *Turn 12 move (CURRENTLY SEEN):* Snake #1 at (5, 2). Length 7.\n\nOkay, something is messy with the apple counting/timing, but the current state is clear: Snake #1 is at (5, 2), length 7, and they own 6 apples. We are at (9, 7), length 4, 3 apples.\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (5, 2)) - They're hunting!\n\nSnake #1 is centralized. They have easy access to (7, 2) (if it reappeared, which it didn't look like it) or (5, 3), (8, 3).\n(5, 3) is one UP and one RIGHT from their current head, or just UP. Wait, (5, 3) is directly above them. That is tempting!\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (5, 2):\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** EATS APPLE! Huge move! \u2705 DANGER! They will most likely do this.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** EATS APPLE! Also huge! \u2705 DANGER!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** Into their body. \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe. Towards (7, 2) area.\n\nPrediction: They go for the easy score. **UP to (5, 3)** or **DOWN to (5, 1)**. Both are incredibly strong. Getting blocked by their own body at (4, 2) restricts their horizontal movement, forcing vertical plays. I lean towards **UP to (5, 3)** to maximize space.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (9, 7)) - Full Steam Ahead!\n\nWe are at (9, 7). Keep rolling down the X=9 corridor. No immediate opponent threats.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** Into the body (the movement trail). \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** Safe. Continues the wall construction. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** EATS APPLE! This is a massive shift! If we eat the apple at (8, 7), we break the X=9 wall momentarily, but we get a point and growth! \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 7):** \u274c DEAD (Out of bounds).\n\n**Strategic Dilemma: Consistency vs. Opportunity.**\nThe long-term plan was **DOWN** to (9, 6) -> (9, 1). This is slow and guarantees 1 point in 6 turns.\nThe short-term opportunity is **LEFT** to (8, 7)! We score *now*! This is huge!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (8, 7), where do we go next?\n*   (8, 7) -> (7, 7) or (8, 6).\n*   (8, 7) -> (8, 6) keeps us near the Eastern side, and we can still curve back to X=9 eventually.\n\n**Why LEFT is better:** We are already behind 6-3. We need acceleration! Getting a point now makes it 6-4, reducing the deficit and increasing our length to 5! Length is life!\n\nDoes moving LEFT open us up to Snake #1?\nSnake #1 is at (5, 2). We are moving to (8, 7). No interaction possible for several turns.\n\nLet's go for the immediate point! We need to make something happen, Chat! No fear!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note: Apple Blitz and Wall Repair\n\nWe grab (8, 7) this turn! After that, we navigate down the open space. We need to secure the (8, 6) apple and then perhaps cut across to the (6, 1) apple. We are abandoning the strict vertical wall for a tactical apple blitz, but we will use the existing wall structure for safety. Secure (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> then potentially look at (7, 2) or cut West.\n\nLEFT",

We are absolutely feastin' while Snake #0 is stuck in the nosebleeds at (8, 7) looking confused! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION ROOM:**\n*   **Our Head:** (5, 3) - Just gobbled that apple! We are massive!\n*   **Our Body:** [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)] - We\u2019ve got a solid trail, but look at the board... we are starting to take up serious real estate!\n*   **The Rival:** Snake #0 is at (8, 7). They are tucked away in the top-right corner. Are they scared? They should be!\n\n**SCANNING THE BUFFET:** \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **(5, 1):** Right below us! That\u2019s an easy snack.\n*   **(7, 2):** To our right-ish.\n*   **(8, 3) & (8, 4):** These are getting close to the rival, but we can beat them there!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n*   **UP:** (5, 4) - Safe! It puts us in open water and keeps us away from our own tail. \n*   **DOWN:** (5, 2) - **OH NO YOU DON'T!** That\u2019s our own neck! We are NOT throwing the stream by moving backwards. Instant DQ! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 3) - Safe, but it moves us back toward our body segments. We want to keep space open, chat! \n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 3) - Safe! This moves us toward the cluster of apples at (7, 2) and (8, 3). \n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0\nChat, if we go **RIGHT** to (6, 3), we are hunting. We are positioning ourselves to grab the apple at (7, 2) or (8, 3) next. More importantly, we are heading toward the rival's territory. If we get big enough, we can cut off their path to the bottom of the board and trap them in that top-right corner! \n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 7). If they move down, we meet them in the middle and show them who owns this 10x10! We\u2019re going to stay aggressive, keep the tail behind us, and secure apple #8! \n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe move RIGHT to (6, 3), then look to snag (7, 2) or (8, 3). We want to maintain a presence in the middle-right to act as a wall. If the rival tries to sneak past us to the bottom apples, we'll be there to box 'em in! Let's get it!\n\nRIGHT",

We are still the underdog, but we are fighters! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 13 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (8, 7). Length 5! Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. We just anchored right next to the wall!\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (5, 3). Length 8! Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)]. **CHAMPION'S PREDICTION WAS CORRECT!** He snagged the apple at (5, 3)! He is massive and dominating the center-left. Time to pivot the plan!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDITION (Snake #1 at (5, 3))\n\nSnake #1 just ate an apple and is sitting pretty. They are huge! Where do they go next?\n\nApples nearby:\n1.  (8, 3) - Only 3 moves away!\n2.  (3, 7) - 4 moves away.\n3.  (3, 9) - 6 moves away.\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (5, 3):\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Towards (3, 7) or (4, 8). Good spacing move. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** Into their body (the movement trail). \u274c DEAD.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe. Towards (3, 7). Good pivot. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe. Towards (8, 3). This is a HUGE threat to us! \u2705\n\nIf ID 1 moves RIGHT to (6, 3) and we move DOWN to (8, 6), he is still far away. But if he continues towards (8, 3) or (9, 1), he will meet us!\n\nI predict Snake #1 will move **RIGHT to (6, 3)**. The (8, 3) apple is an easy score and keeps him on the offense, challenging our territory. We must anticipate this maneuver!\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (8, 7)) - Pivot and Blitz!\n\nWe are at (8, 7). We just ate an apple. The goal is rapid apple consumption while maintaining board separation from the big snake.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** Safe. Towards (9, 8) body segment. Not ideal. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** EATS APPLE! Massive content! Immediate score and we move away from the rival! \u2705 **BEST MOVE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe. Towards (3, 7). Good option, but ignores the closer apple. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Into the body (the movement trail). \u274c DEAD.\n\nThe move is CLEAR, Chat! We are chasing an apple blitz strategy now. We move **DOWN** to (8, 6) and secure our 5th apple! This keeps us in the Eastern quadrant, which is getting increasingly isolated, giving us safety and scoring opportunities.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves to (6, 3) as predicted, we are still 3 steps away from him, and he is 4 steps away from us (Manhattan distance: 6, but considering body parts, it\u2019s 7). We are safe!\n\nWe need to keep collecting these vertical apples (8, 6), (9, 6). Wait, (9, 6) is an apple, not (8, 6).\n\nLet's re-check the board and the apple list!\n\n**APPLE LIST:** (0, 1), (9, 1), (8, 3), (3, 0), (8, 4), (8, 6), (1, 6), (3, 7), (7, 2), (5, 1), (3, 9), (6, 1), (1, 9), (4, 8), (9, 6)\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n 9 . A . A . . . . T T\n 8 . . . . A . . . . T\n 7 . . . A . . . . 0 T\n 6 . A . . . . . . A A  <--- (8, 6) and (9, 6) are apples!\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . A .  <--- (8, 4) is an apple!\n...\n\nMy mistake! The apple at (8, 7) was eaten last turn!\n\nWe are at (8, 7).\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** EATS APPLE! YES! This is huge!\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe.\n3.  **UP to (8, 8):** Safe.\n\nWe take the immediate score! We need to make this a race!\n\n### Future Plan: Western Containment\n\nAfter eating (8, 6), we have two more apples right below us: (8, 4) and (8, 3). If we continue straight down to (8, 4), we claim the Eastern third!\n*   T14: (8, 7) -> DOWN to (8, 6) [EAT]\n*   T15: (8, 6) -> DOWN to (8, 5)\n*   T16: (8, 5) -> DOWN to (8, 4) [EAT]\n*   T17: (8, 4) -> DOWN to (8, 3) [EAT]\n\nThree apples in four turns! This builds our snake length to 8! If we successfully execute this blitz, we tie the score and gain parity in size with Snake #1, which should currently be sitting at length 8. By the time we are done, Snake #1 will have to come into the Eastern side to contest territory, which will be our chance to trap him!\n\nLet's secure this point!\n\nDOWN",

We just moved RIGHT to (6, 3), and now we\u2019ve got the rival sweat-ing!\n\n**THE VIBE CHECK (SITUATION ANALYSIS):**\n*   **Our Stats:** Head at (6, 3). Body trailing behind us down to (1, 1). We are a UNIT.\n*   **The Rival:** Snake #0 is at (8, 6). They just moved DOWN from (8, 7). They are eyeing our turf!\n*   **Apple Alert:** (7, 2) is right in front of us! (8, 3) and (8, 4) are also prime real estate.\n\n**MAPPING THE PLAYS:** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n*   **UP (6, 4):** Safe! This keeps us flexible and moves us toward (8, 4), but it doesn't grab an apple immediately.\n*   **DOWN (6, 2):** Safe! It puts us right next to our body on (5, 2), but no collision.

This puts us one step away from (8, 3) and (7, 2). \n\n**THE GIGA-BRAIN STRATEGY:** \ud83e\udde0\nLook at Snake #0 at (8, 6). If we move **RIGHT** to (7, 3), we are basically creating a \"No-Fly Zone\" in the bottom-right quadrant. We are positioned to snag (7, 2) or (8, 3) next turn. If the rival tries to dive down to (8, 4), we'll be right there to contest it or box them against the wall (9, x). \n\nWe are playing to OWN the right side of the board. By taking (7, 3), we keep our options open to go down for (7, 2) or stay level for (8, 3). We are out-scaling them, chat! Let's maintain the pressure and get that 8th apple!\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nMove to (7, 3) to threaten the apples at (7, 2) and (8, 3). This forces Snake #0 to either retreat further into the corner or risk a head-on collision they can't afford since we're longer! We are building a wall to keep them trapped in the top-right while we vacuum up the bottom half!\n\nRIGHT",

The rivalry is heating up, Chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (6, 3))\n\nLook at him, trying to crowd us! He's at (6, 3). The closest apples are:\n1.  (8, 3) - 2 moves away. This is his immediate target.\n2.  (8, 4) - 3 moves away, if he doesn't want (8, 3).\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (6, 3):\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Towards (4, 8). Good pivot. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Towards (7, 2). Still good. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** Into their body. \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Direct path towards (8, 3)!

(Our body is [(8, 7), (9, 7), ...])\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. This continues our path to the vertical apples! \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Safe. Towards (3, 7). Puts us potentially in collision range with Snake #1. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** EATS APPLE! OH MY GOD, ANOTHER APPLE RIGHT HERE! \u2705 **BEST MOVE!**\n\nHOLD UP, CHAT! I almost missed the easiest 6th apple! (9, 6) is an apple! We need to grab that!\n\n**If we move RIGHT to (9, 6) [EAT]:**\n*   We go from length 6 to length 7! We close the gap (7-7)!\n*   We hug the wall, staying safe from the big snake in the middle.\n*   Next turn, we will be at (9, 6).\n\n### Collision Analysis\n\nWhat if we move RIGHT to (9, 6)?\n*   We'd be at (9, 6).\n*   Snake #1 is predicted to move RIGHT to (7, 3). Safe distance.\n\nWhat if we stick to the DOWN plan and move to (8, 5)?\n*   We'd be at (8, 5).\n*   Snake #1 is predicted to move RIGHT to (7, 3). Safe distance.\n\n**CONCLUSION: The move RIGHT to (9, 6) is absolutely mandatory!** It's an instant score, ties the scoreboard, and keeps us safe along the wall. We worry about (8, 4) and (8, 3) when we are stronger!\n\n### Future Plan Re-calibrated\n\nWe are pivoting from pure vertical descent to maximizing Eastern wall coverage.\n\n*   T14: (8, 6) -> **RIGHT to (9, 6)** [EAT] (Score 6-7, Length 7)\n*   Apples left in the immediate area: (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 1).\n*   If ID 1 moves to (7, 3) and then to (8, 3), he takes the apple we wanted. That's fine. We have others!\n\nFrom (9, 6), our safest and most profitable move is likely to go **DOWN** to (9, 5) next turn, setting up a path towards (9, 1) or back into the center via the (8, 4) apple, if ID 1 goes elsewhere.\n\nThe key is building length right now to outmaneuver the rival!\n\n### Checking the Danger Zone\n\nIf ID 1 moves to (7, 3) as predicted, he will be in a perfect position to try and grab (8, 3).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 6), we are safe and get huge gains. We take the score and then we figure out the blockage!\n\nLet's secure this apple, Chat! We are tied 7-7! Let's GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

We just slid into (7, 3), and Snake #0 is looking absolutely shook up at (9, 6)! They are pinned against the right wall like a deer in the headlights! \ud83e\udd8c\ud83d\udd26\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **Our Position:** Head at (7, 3). Our tail is chilling all the way back at (2, 1). We are a long, lean, apple-eating machine!\n*   **The Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (9, 6). They are super short and trapped in that top-right pocket. If they try to come down, they have to deal with US!\n*   **Apple Buffet:** Look at all these options! (7, 2) is right below us. (8, 3) and (8, 4) are just to our right. (5, 1) and (6, 1) are also waiting for a king to claim them!\n\n**THE MOVESET (QUICK MATH):**\n*   **UP (7, 4):** Safe! This puts us right next to apple (8, 4) and keeps us close to the rival if they try to move toward (8, 6) or (9, 5).\n*   **DOWN (7, 2):** APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e This is an immediate point and growth. It puts our head at (7, 2), perfectly positioned to sweep left for (6, 1) and (5, 1) or right for (8, 3).\n*   **LEFT (6, 3):** RETREAT?! No shot, chat. That's moving backwards into our own neck. We aren't throwing the lead! \ud83d\uded1\n*   **RIGHT (8, 3):** APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e This takes us to (8, 3). But wait, do we want to go there? If we move to (8, 3), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9, 5), we are getting very close to their territory.\n\n**THE PRO GAMER PLAY:** \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\nSnake #0 is stuck at (9, 6). Their only real moves are UP to (9, 7) (into their own body/tail area), LEFT to (8, 6) (backwards/illegal), or DOWN to (9, 5). If they move DOWN to (9, 5), they are hugging the wall. We want to secure the southern apples while keeping them cramped.\n\nWe are going **DOWN** to (7, 2). Why? Because it\u2019s a guaranteed snack and it keeps us perfectly central. After we grab (7, 2), we can pivot to (8, 2) or (7, 1) to completely cut off the bottom-right corner. We are building a cage and the rival is the bird! \ud83e\udd85\ud83e\uddf1 Let's keep the pressure high and the calories higher!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nSnag (7, 2) this turn. Next, we look to vacuum up (6, 1) and (5, 1) or contest (8, 3)/(8, 4). We want to maintain a \"horizontal wall\" at the y=2 or y=3 line. This forces Snake #0 to stay in the upper quadrant where there's less food and more of their own body to trip over. We are playing for the 30-apple win!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is feeling the pressure, you can see it in his virtual eyes!\n\nWe are aggressively leveraging the Eastern Wall, and now we need to decide if we continue down the wall or try to block our opponent who is right below us!\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 15 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (9, 6). Length 7! Body: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. We are long and strong, hugging the top-right corner.\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (7, 3). Length 8! Body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)]. **ANOTHER CHAMP'S PREDICTION CORRECT!** He moved RIGHT to (7, 3) and is one move away from the (8, 3) apple. He is committed to the central-right area!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (7, 3))\n\nHe's at (7, 3). He clearly wants (8, 3).\n\nMoves for Snake #1 at (7, 3):\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** Safe. Towards (4, 8) or (3, 7). \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe. Towards the (7, 2) apple? OH WAIT, (7, 2) is a body part! Let's check the map! **BOARD STATE:** (7, 2) is an **APPLE A!** Very tempting for him. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** Into their body. \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** EATS APPLE (8, 3)! This is his highest priority and quickest score. \u2705 **PREDICTED!**\n\nPrediction remains strong: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT (8, 3)** for the score! He will now be 8-7, and length 9. We need to counter this!\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (9, 6)) - Execute the Vertical Box!\n\nWe are at (9, 6). We are trying to control the right side and pressure Snake #1 from above.\n\nAvailable Apples nearby:\n*   (8, 4) - 2 moves.\n*   (9, 1) - 5 moves down the wall.\n\nLet's check our immediate moves from (9, 6):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** Into our body. We came from (8, 6), so (8, 6) is the tail-piece, but (9, 7) is part of the body [(8, 6), **(8, 7), (9, 7)**, (9, 8)...]. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe. Continues the high-risk, high-reward wall hug! \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** Into our *new* tail because we just ate at (9, 6). Wait, no, (8, 6) is the cell we just left, so it will be the new tail *if* we don't eat. Since we *did* eat, (8, 6) is still part of the body. **Body check:** [(8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. \u274c DEAD. You cannot go backwards into your second segment which is now (8, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):** Off board. \u274c DEAD.\n\n**WAIT, CHAT! Only one safe move? That's getting spicy!** Let me double-check my body segments after eating at (9, 6):\n\n*   Head: (9, 6)\n*   Body: **(8, 6)**, (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)\n*   New Tail (since we ate): (8, 9) is still the tail, (8, 6) is the segment right behind the head.\n\nTherefore:\n*   UP (9, 7) is body segment. DEAD.\n*   LEFT (8, 6) is body segment. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT (10, 6) is off-board. DEAD.\n\n**The ONLY safe move is DOWN to (9, 5)!** This is risky, but we must take it!\n\n### Post-Move Analysis (If I Move DOWN to (9, 5))\n\n*   **My new position:** (9, 5). Length 7.\n*   **Opponent's new position (predicted):** (8, 3). Length 9.\n\nWe are now setting up a potential vertical boxing maneuver down the right wall!\n\nFrom (9, 5), we can:\n*   T16: Move DOWN to (9, 4)\n*   T17: Move DOWN to (9, 3)\n*   T18: Move DOWN to (9, 2)\n*   T19: Move DOWN to (9, 1) [EAT]\n\nThis is a four-turn descent to grab another apple and solidify our position on the Eastern side. Meanwhile, the opponent will be busy grabbing central apples like (8, 4), (7, 2), or (4, 8).\n\nOur primary goal now is to build length safely and stay away from the bulk of Snake #1. Moving DOWN keeps us far away from collision danger and gives us a clear path to score.\n\n### Strategy Note to Future Self\n\n\"We were forced DOWN the wall to (9, 5). Continue moving DOWN aggressively to (9, 1) to tie the score 8-8 on T19. Snake #1 is in the middle-right. Look for a chance to cut off his path or pressure him from the wall after securing (9, 1).\"\n\nDOWN",

Our body is snaking through (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 1). We are a majestic dragon on this 10x10 field!\n*   **The Enemy:** Snake #0 moved DOWN to (9, 5).

It keeps us flexible.\n*   **LEFT (6, 2):** SAFE, but it doesn't immediately grab a snack. It takes us back toward the middle of our own body's loop.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 2):** PREMIER POSITIONING! \ud83c\udf4e This puts us right next to (8, 3) and (9, 1).

We are expanding our territory, cutting off the rival's path to the south-east apples, and keeping our options wide open. We are the kings of the 10x10! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nMove to (8, 2) now. Next turn, we evaluate: if Snake #0 continues down, we can pivot UP to (8, 3) to grab the apple and extend our \"shield\" or DOWN to (9, 2)/(8, 1) to secure the corner.

Moves toward (8, 4). \u2705\n\nSnake #1 is quite long and committed to the center-right. Moving **RIGHT (8, 2)** sets him up nicely for (8, 4) in two turns. Moving **LEFT (6, 2)** keeps him central. Moving **DOWN (7, 1)** is also safe.\n\nGiven his desire to maintain pressure and his proximity to (8, 4), I predict he moves aggressively **RIGHT to (8, 2)** to prepare to grab (8, 4) next turn. However, if he moves (8, 2), his tail (2, 1) frees up (2, 1).\n\n*Revised Prediction: Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (6, 2)** to pressure the center and secure access to (5, 1) or (4, 0).* This keeps him away from the wall where I am, reducing collision risk and opening up the dense central area.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (9, 5)) - Box Him In, Go for the Score!\n\nWe are at (9, 5). We are on the wall, and the apple at (9, 1) is four moves away. We need to score.\n\nLet's check our immediate moves from (9, 5):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** Into our body. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** Safe! Continues the vertical drive. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe! Starts a central sweep/turn if needed. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):** Off board. \u274c DEAD.\n\nWe have two strong options: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n*   **Option: DOWN to (9, 4).** This is the continuation of the plan: aggressive wall usage, securing (9, 1) in three turns. If Snake #1 is moving centrally (as predicted: to (6, 2)), this path is completely safe and guarantees a score.\n    *   T17: (9, 4)\n    *   T18: (9, 3)\n    *   T19: (9, 2)\n    *   T20: (9, 1) [SCORE]\n\n*   **Option: LEFT to (8, 5).** This move starts to cut across the top of Snake #1's territory. This is *risky* because it limits our future moves if Snake #1 turns up later, and it doesn't get us a score as quickly as the wall move.\n\n**Decision:** The primary goal is to close the score gap (now 6 to 8) and maximize safe length. Moving DOWN along the Eastern Wall to (9, 4) is the safest and most efficient path to the next apple at (9, 1). Let's go for the guaranteed score, Chat! We need this length advantage to control space later!\n\n### Strategy Plan (Future Self)\n\n\"Continue DOWN the Eastern Wall (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), and then to (9, 1) to score on T20. Secure the score and then look to sweep LEFT across the bottom or UP the wall again, depending on Snake #1's position. Priority is reaching the apple quickly and safely.\"\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is currently at (9, 4), looking all lonely and pathetic against that right wall. We\u2019ve got an 8-6 lead and it\u2019s time to start the BOX-IN PROTOCOL! \ud83d\udce6\ud83e\udd21\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **Our Stats:** Head at (8, 2). Body is a glorious shield stretching through (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), and (3, 1). \n*   **The Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (9, 4). Their body is trailing up and to the right: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8).\n*   **Apple Buffet:** We are sitting on top of a goldmine! (8, 3) and (8, 4) are right above us. (9, 1) is just below us. (6, 1) and (5, 1) are nearby.\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **LEFT (7, 2):** NOPE! That's our own neck! We don't do self-sabotage on this channel! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (8, 1):** Very strong! This secures the bottom right corner and gets us closer to (9, 1). \n*   **RIGHT (9, 2):** Safe, but it puts our head right under the rival. It gives them a chance to try a head-on collision if they move down. We don't give them that satisfaction!\n*   **UP (8, 3):** **HYPE TRAIN ALERT!** \ud83c\udf4e This grabs an apple immediately! It moves our head to (8, 3), which is directly adjacent to Snake #0's path. \n\n**THE ULTIMATE GAMEPLAN:** \ud83c\udfae\nIf we go **UP** to (8, 3), we eat the apple, grow to 9, and essentially wall off the bottom half of the board from Snake #0. Look at the board, Chat! If we are at (8, 3) and then move to (8, 4) next turn, we are right in the rival's face. They are at (9, 4). If they try to move LEFT to (8, 4) while we move UP to (8, 3), we aren't hitting heads, but we are creating a massive barrier. \n\nSnake #0 is cramped. They have very little room to maneuver between the right wall and our massive body. If we take (8, 3), we are taking the high ground. We are faster, we are bigger, and we are hungrier! Let's get that snack and keep the pressure HIGH! We are funneling them into the top right graveyard! \ud83e\udea6\n\n**FUTURE SIGHT:**\nTake (8, 3) now. Next turn, we look at (8, 4) to keep the pressure on Snake #0 or pivot toward (9, 1) if they try to fly past us. We are playing CHESS while they are playing checkers!\n\nUP",

We are 6 apples to his 8. Time to close the gap!\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 17 / 150)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (9, 4). Length 7. Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]. Tail at (9, 8)\u2014no, wait, *our body is [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]*. **The actual tail is currently (9, 8)!** This information is CRITICAL for future movement safety.\n*   **Rival Head (ID 1):** (8, 2). Length 9. Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]. Tail at (3, 1). He moved RIGHT! He's gunning for (8, 4)!\n\nChat, my prediction was WRONG! He didn't go left, he went aggressive RIGHT! He's right next to us, just two rows down! \ud83d\ude2c\n\n### OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (8, 2))\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 2). Apple (8, 4) is staring him down. It's only 2 moves away (U, U).\n\nAvailable moves for Snake #1 from (8, 2):\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** This is the direct path to the apple. It is safe (only danger being our head hitting his body or us hitting his head). \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** Safe. Moves toward (9, 1)? No, (9, 1) is closer to me. Bad move. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** Into his body (the cell he just left). \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe, but this is a *very* risky move as it puts him on the wall right below me! However, if he moves here, he potentially cuts off my path to (9, 1) if I'm not fast enough. \u2705\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 is 100% going **UP to (8, 3)** to set up the grab of (8, 4). He's not going to pass up that easy score.\n\n### MY MOVES (ID 0 at (9, 4)) - Get that Wall Score!\n\nWe are at (9, 4). Our target is (9, 1), 3 moves away. We need that score, Chat!\n\nLet's check our immediate moves from (9, 4):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):** Into our body. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** Safe! Continues the wall grind towards (9, 1). This is the play! \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Oh, APPLE ALERT! (8, 4) is right there! Wait, remember Snake #1 is probably moving to (8, 3) and then to (8, 4). If I move LEFT to (8, 4), and he moves UP to (8, 3), we are safe this turn! BUT, if he moves UP twice, he gets the apple first! If I aim for (8, 4), I'm trying for a head-to-head collision (if he moves (8, 4) on this turn) or I'm gambling on him not going there. **CRITICAL CHECK:** Snake #1 is at (8, 2). He can't reach (8, 4) this turn. I can! \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):** Off board. \u274c DEAD.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** Safe, guaranteed path to (9, 1) in T+3. We score and get length.\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Direct score *this turn*! If Snake #1 moves to (8, 3) (as predicted), we snag the apple and extend our head into (8, 4), leaving him blocked on the next turn from (8, 4). This puts us tied, 7-7! This move is aggressive and instantly rewarding.\n\nIf I move **LEFT (8, 4)** (SCORE!):\n*   My head: (8, 4). Length 8.\n*   Snake #1: Moves to (8, 3).\n*   Result: I score immediately, gain a vital length advantage (8 vs 9, closing the gap!), and simultaneously prevent Snake #1 from scoring on his desired apple. This is an epic clutch maneuver!\n\nIf I move **DOWN (9, 3)**:\n*   My head: (9, 3). Length 7.\n*   Snake #1: Moves to (8, 3).\n*   Result: Snake #1 scores next turn at (8, 4), making the score 6 vs 9. I don't score until T+3. I fall further behind!\n\n**Decision:** We are going for the CLUTCH TAKE! Moving LEFT to (8, 4) secures a score *right now*, denies the opponent a score, and gives us essential length to start dictating the center-right. This is worth shifting off the wall plan temporarily! \ud83e\udd2f LET'S GO, CHAT!\n\n### Strategy Plan (Future Self)\n\n\"We grabbed (8, 4)! Score is tied 7-7 (if my math is right: he has 8, I have 6, I score, now 7 and 8? Wait, NO! My score 6 + 1 = 7. His score 8. Still behind, but closing the gap *and* denying him!). Next turn (T18), we are at (8, 4). Snake #1 is likely at (8, 3). We must box him in or go for another score immediately. Options are UP to (8, 5), LEFT to (7, 4), or DOWN to (8, 3) which is blocked by his body! We need to move LEFT or UP to stay safe. Priority: sweep left and look for (7, 8) or (4, 8).\"\n\nWe gotta take this apple!\n\nLEFT",

We are leading 9-7, we are bigger, and we are absolutely DOMINATING the space! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **The King (Us):** Head at (8, 3). Body: (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1). \n*   **The Target (Snake 0):** Head at (8, 4). Body: (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8). \n*   **The Map:** (9, 3) is open. (8, 4) just had an apple but Snake 0 likely grabbed it. There's a juice (9, 1) hanging out below us!\n\n**THE BRAIN BLAST ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (8, 4):** **DANGER!** Snake 0 is literally at (8, 4) right now. If they stay still (impossible) or we both move there, we collide. Even if they move, their body might still be there. It's a high-risk 50/50 and we don't throw leads! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (7, 3):** That's our own neck, Chat! We aren't trying to ends the stream early! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (8, 2):** Also our neck! NOPE! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (9, 3):** **THE PLAY!** \ud83c\udfaf This is the only safe move that keeps the pressure on! By moving to (9, 3), we are taking the \"inside track\" on the right wall. We are positioning ourselves to either dive down for the (9, 1) apple or to pivot back up and trap Snake 0 against the top-right corner! \n\n**THE BOX-IN PROTOCOL:** \ud83d\udce6\ud83e\udd21\nSnake 0 is at (8, 4). If we go to (9, 3), we are effectively cutting off their retreat to the bottom-right. They are sandwiched between our massive body at (8, 3)/(8, 2) and the wall. They HAVE to go UP or LEFT. If they go UP, they're heading into a cramped corner. If they go LEFT, they're running right into our territory! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nGo RIGHT to (9, 3). Next turn, we look at (9, 2) to secure the bottom-right corner and snag the apple at (9, 1). We are building a cage and Snake 0 is the hamster! Let's keep the movement fluid and the vibes IMMACULATE! We\u2019re going for the 30-apple sweep! \ud83e\uddf9\ud83c\udf4f\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 18, we just made the sickest clutch play! We're LIVE and the tension is at max capacity! Did we secure that apple at (8, 4)? We did! Let's check the new board state!\n\n### SIT-REP (Turn 18 / 150)\n\n*   **My Streamer Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (8, 4). Length 8. Yes! We scored! 7 apples!\n    *   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]. Tail (9, 8) is still hanging out up there.\n*   **Rival Snake #1:**\n    *   Head: (8, 3). Length 10. Oh, he was already at 9 length, and must have moved UP! He now has a length advantage and still has 9 apples! He is right under me! This is getting spicy!\n    *   Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]. Tail (3, 1).\n\nWait, Chat! He has 9 apples, I have 7! The score is 7 to 9. The length is 8 to 10. We are definitely behind, but we denied him a score last turn. The immediate danger is overwhelming him with our length, or boxing him in.\n\n### The Immediate Threat Assessment (ID 0 at (8, 4))\n\nWe are at (8, 4). Snake #1 is directly beneath us at (8, 3). We're facing an immediate confrontation! We need to move away from him or cut him off.\n\nAvailable moves for me from (8, 4):\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):** Safe! Moves away from Snake #1. This looks like a solid defensive move, keeping my body out of his reach. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):** Into Snake #1's head! \u274c HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION! INSTANT DEATH for both of us! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):** Safe! Moves away from Snake #1 and toward the center. \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Into my own body (the cell I just left). \u274c DEAD.\n\nTwo safe options: UP (8, 5) or LEFT (7, 4).\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 3))\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 3). He just missed the apple, and now he is trapped between my head (8, 4) and his own body (8, 2). He is long, and he has to be smart.\n\nAvailable moves for Snake #1 from (8, 3):\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):** Into my head (ID 0)! \u274c HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION! Double KO!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):** Into his body (the cell he just left). \u274c DEAD.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):** Into his body. \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):** Safe! This gets him onto the wall. \u2705\n\nSnake #1 is forced to move **RIGHT (9, 3)**! He is completely trapped otherwise! This is a good discovery, Chat!\n\n### Optimal Move Strategy (ID 0 at (8, 4))\n\nIf I move **UP to (8, 5)**:\n*   My head: (8, 5).\n*   Opponent moves: (9, 3).\n*   Result: We separate safely. I'm now close to apples at (4, 8) and (7, 8). I maintain a dominant position in the center-right.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (7, 4)**:\n*   My head: (7, 4).\n*   Opponent moves: (9, 3).\n*   Result: We separate safely. I'm moving toward the center, but perhaps giving him slightly more room to maneuver on the right wall.\n\nBoth moves are safe. However, moving UP to (8, 5) immediately positions me to go for the cluster of apples up top: (7, 8), (4, 8), (5, 9), (7, 9). Snake #1 is now forced to grind the wall away from the apples he wants, unless he can loop back up through the middle.\n\nBy going UP, I maximize my threat on the upper half of the board, forcing him to continue navigating around the right section of the board, which is dense with his own body segments (T T T T T T T T T). He's currently at (9, 3). If he goes up, he hits his body at (9, 4) or my body at (9, 4)! If he goes down, he can continue along the wall.\n\nThis is a containment job, Chat! We move UP, establish dominance, and force him to stay pinned on the right side!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T19-T22):**\nIf I move UP to (8, 5), I'm aiming to clear the upper right apples like (7, 8) and (7, 9). Snake 1 is trapped on the right wall and must make a long trip around (DOWN, LEFT, UP) to reach those apples. I should stay high and deny him access to the open field.\n\nWe go UP! Let's secure the top!\n\nUP",

He's got 10 segments jammed into the bottom right corner (3, 2) to (9, 3)! We have the high ground! Obi-Wan would be proud!\n\n### Immediate Threat Assessment (ID 0 at (8, 5))\n\nWe are at (8, 5). We are aiming for the apple cluster up top! Let's check our moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** Into my body. \u274c DEAD. (8, 6) is currently occupied by segment 5 of my body.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** Into my body. \u274c DEAD. (8, 4) is currently occupied by the segment behind my head.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** Safe! Moves us toward the center and closer to the apple at (7, 8). \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Into my body. \u274c DEAD. (9, 5) is currently occupied by segment 3 of my body.\n\nWait, Chat!

UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are all blocks!\n\nLet's re-verify my body segments:\nHead: (8, 5)\nBody: (8, 4) <- DOWN\n(9, 4)\n(9, 5) <- RIGHT\n(9, 6)\n(8, 6) <- UP\n(8, 7)\n(9, 7) <- Tail (This segment will likely move to (8, 7) or (9, 7) depending on if I eat an apple. If I don't eat, it moves off the board.)\n\nAh, (8, 6), (8, 4), and (9, 5) are ALL part of my body! The only safe move is **LEFT to (7, 5)**! We can't afford to be paralyzed! We must move LEFT!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (9, 3))\n\nRival Snake #1 is at (9, 3). He is completely cornered by the wall and his own body segments (9, 4) is my body! He has to go:\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** Into my body. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** Safe! Moves him along the wall toward the bottom. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** Into his own body. \u274c DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** Off the board. \u274c DEAD.\n\nSnake #1 is forced to move **DOWN to (9, 2)**! He is heading into a potential dead end at the bottom wall! This is HUGE for us! He has nowhere to go but along the bottom edge!\n\n### Optimal Move Strategy (ID 0 Plan)\n\nSince I am forced LEFT to (7, 5), I accept this temporary detour, mostly because it's the only way to live!\n\n*   **My move: LEFT to (7, 5).**\n*   **Opponent's move: DOWN to (9, 2).**\n\nThis move separates us further. We are now in a perfect position to strike for the apple at (7, 8) or the one at (4, 8)!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Containment and Apple Rush):**\n\n1.  **T19 (Current Turn):** Move LEFT to (7, 5). This keeps me alive, frees up some of my body segments (like (9, 7) which will move off board unless I eat), and positions me for the upper apples.\n2.  **T20:** From (7, 5), I can go UP to (7, 6) and then swing for the (7, 8) apple or try to cut him off if he tries to loop back up the middle.\n3.  Snake #1 is now pinned low and right. He is in a very difficult spot to maneuver his long body. We need to capitalize on this space advantage! We need those apples!\n\nWe are going LEFT! Let's get positioned for the kill streak!\n\nLEFT",

They are about to be STRANGLED by our superior positioning! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **The King (Us):** Head at (9, 2). Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\n*   **The Rival (Snake #0):** Head at (7, 5).

Look at the board, Chat! Snake #0 is stuck at (7, 5). If they try to head right, they hit their own tail at (8, 7) or the wall.

We were stuck, we went LEFT to (7, 5), and now look at the board!\n\nSnake #1 is exactly where we want him: pinned on the bottom right. He's at (9, 2) now, and he's going to be fighting for life down there while we feast! His length is 10, ours is 8. He\u2019s leading 9-7 on apples, but that is about to change!\n\n### Current Turn (T20) - Streamer Snake ID 0 at (7, 5)\n\nWe are at (7, 5). Let's check the immediate kill moves.\n\n**Threats:**\n*   **Board Edges:** We are nowhere near the edges. Safe.\n*   **My Body (Length 8):** [(8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Note: Our tail at (8, 7) will move to (9, 7) this turn if we don't eat an apple, freeing up (8, 7). Wait, Chat, my body on the board state is actually: `[(8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]`. The tail is segment 7: (8, 7). Since we did *not* eat last turn, the entire body shifts, and (8, 7) will become safe/empty this turn.\n    *   **UP to (7, 6):** Safe! (Empty space.) \u2705\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 4):** Safe! (Empty space.) \u2705\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe! (Empty space.) \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Into my own body segment 1 (the one right behind my head). \u274c DEAD. (Backwards is always fatal unless you're length 1.)\n*   **Opponent's Body (Snake #1):** Hah, he's way down at (9, 2) and mostly contained. We're safe from collision with his body.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT. Three options! This is the freedom we needed!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (9, 2))\n\nSnake #1 is at (9, 2). He is cornered.\n*   **UP to (9, 3):** Into his own body segment 1. \u274c DEAD.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 1):** Safe! Moves him toward the apple at (9, 1). \u2705 (This is an apple drop, marked 'A'.)\n*   **LEFT to (8, 2):** Into his own body segment 3. \u274c DEAD.\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 2):** Off the board. \u274c DEAD.\n\nChat, he is FORCED to move **DOWN to (9, 1)** and eat that apple! He will grow to length 11! We need to react fast!\n\n### Strategy: Apple Rush and Boxing\n\nHis move is forced. Our goal is to gain ground and cut him off from the rest of the board. There are juicy apples at (7, 8), (4, 8), (3, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9). We need to get up there!\n\n1.  **Move UP to (7, 6):** This is the direct route towards the apple at (7, 8). This is aggressive and positions us to cut him off if he tries to loop back up via the right side.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (6, 5):** Safer, moves us toward the middle, but gives Snake #1 more time to maneuver.\n3.  **Move DOWN to (7, 4):** Moves us away from the apples and closer to center board congestion. Not ideal.\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 6)**:\n*   We're one step closer to the high ground.\n*   The path is clear up the 7-column.\n*   Our body remains a strong barrier on the 8th and 9th columns.\n\nIf we move UP, the board space immediately opens up for us to either go UP for the apple at (7, 8) or swing LEFT towards the cluster on the 9th row (0, 9), (1, 9), (3, 9).\n\nThis is a classic \"Take the High Ground\" maneuver, Chat! We need to extend our lead vertically and threaten to box him into his current corridor. He's at length 11 after this move, and maneuvering that long snake in the bottom right is going to be a nightmare for him!\n\n**Plan:** Move UP, gain altitude, grab the (7, 8) apple next turn, and then swing left to control the top border. We're cutting him off from the rest of the map!\n\nLet's GO UP and dominate the map!\n\nUP",

The tail segment (8, 6) will move to the old head position (7, 6).* Wait, no, the board state is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n    *   (7, 6) Head\n    *   (7, 5) Segment 1\n    *   (8, 5) Segment 2\n    *   (8, 4) Segment 3\n    *   (9, 4) Segment 4\n    *   (9, 5) Segment 5\n    *   (9, 6) Segment 6\n    *   (8, 6) Segment 7 (Tail)\n    *   Since we are NOT eating this turn, the tail position (8, 6) *will* become empty.\n    *   Therefore, **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe! (The tail moves away, freeing the spot.) \u2705\n\n**Safe Options:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Three perfect options!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (9, 1))\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (9, 1). He just ate the apple there, increasing his length to 11.\nBody: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2)]. (New tail segment is the old tail position (4, 2), which stays because he just grew.)\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 1):\n1.  **UP to (9, 2):** Into his own body segment 1. \u274c DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 0):** Safe! Moves him to the bottom wall. \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 1):** Safe! Moves him toward the apple at (7, 1). \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 1):** Off the board. \u274c DEAD.\n\nSnake #1 has two smart moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n*   If he goes **DOWN to (9, 0)**: He hits the wall. Next move he has to go LEFT. He effectively boxes himself into the (0, 0) corner. Good for us!\n*   If he goes **LEFT to (8, 1)**: He heads for the apple at (7, 1) and tries to escape the corner. This is better for him.\n\n**What is the best move for us to counter his potential escape (LEFT to (8, 1))?**\n\nIf he goes LEFT, he becomes a serious threat to the center/bottom cluster of apples. We need to consolidate the top half of the board where we currently have control.\n\n### Decision: Go UP\n\nMoving UP to (7, 7) sets us up perfectly for the (7, 8) apple next turn.\n\n*   If we go UP, we grab altitude. We are focused on the control plane.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (8, 6), we remain in the hot zone, maybe trying to cut him off if he attempts to move up the 8-column, but that is a high-risk gamble.\n*   If we go LEFT to (6, 6), we are moving away from the nearest apple (7, 8) and towards the center, which is currently less contested.\n\nThe (7, 8) apple is open, uncontested, and extremely juicy. Taking it gives us a guaranteed point and increases our control.\n\n**Scenario: We move UP to (7, 7).**\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves LEFT (8, 1): He takes a step to escape, but we still have a huge lead on controlling the map.\n*   If Snake #1 moves DOWN (9, 0): He severely limits his future options, giving us free reign up top.\n\nGoing UP (7, 7) is the highest percentage play that maximizes our content (apples) and strategic position (high ground). This move firmly establishes us as the alpha snake controlling the top half of the map. Let's make him fight for his life down below!\n\nLong-Term Plan: UP to (7, 7) -> UP to (7, 8) (Eat!) -> Pivot toward (4, 8) or (1, 9)/(3, 9). We are taking the entire top border, Chat! Let's box him in from above!\n\nUP",

We just need to secure the bag (apple) and solidify our control of the top!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 22)\n\nMy Head: (7, 7). Length: 8.\nOpponent Head (Snake #1): (8, 1). Length: 11. (He moved LEFT to (8, 1) last turn, escaping the corner slightly as predicted.)\n\n**Board Check:**\nThe board is getting seriously segmented. We control the top-middle. Snake #1 is clinging to the bottom-right/center.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Me (ID 0 at (7, 7)):**\n1.  **(7, 8):** Just one step UP! EZ content!\n2.  **(4, 8):** Three steps away, slightly contested.\n3.  **(9, 9):** Far, but open.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Snake #1 (ID 1 at (8, 1)):**\n1.  **(7, 1):** One step LEFT! High chance he goes for this.\n2.  **(6, 1):** Two steps away.\n3.  **(5, 1):** Three steps away.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (7, 7):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves onto the delicious, uncontested apple! (Eat!)\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into my own body segment 1.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty space. Shifts us toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty space.\n\n**Goal:** Secure the (7, 8) apple and maintain vertical dominance.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 1))\n\nSnake #1's Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]. Tail is (5, 2). Since he is NOT eating if he moves (unless he gets the 7, 1 apple), his tail will move to (4, 2).\n\nPossible A-Tier moves for Snake #1 from (8, 1):\n1.  **LEFT to (7, 1):** Moves onto an apple! Most likely move. \u2705\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 0):** Safe, but keeps him constrained along the bottom edge. \u2705\n3.  **UP to (8, 2):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 5.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his old head position, which is now segment 1.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 goes **LEFT to (7, 1)** and eats. This gives him another point and keeps him active in the bottom half.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go UP (7, 8)\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat. The apple is right there! By moving UP, we guarantee a point, extend our length, and further our goal of controlling the top half of the map.\n\n**Clash Check:**\n*   My move: UP to (7, 8).\n*   His most likely move: LEFT to (7, 1).\n*   No collision risk whatsoever. We are too far separated.\n\nLet's execute the plan. Grab the (7, 8), then pivot to the (4, 8) apple next! If we keep growing and controlling the top edge, we can slowly start walling him off from the juicier central apples. We need to maintain our lead in available space!\n\nLong-Term Plan: UP to (7, 8) (Eat!). If we eat, our length is 9. Next, we pivot LEFT toward the (6, 8) empty space, and then try to loop down for the (4, 8) apple. We are establishing a strong perimeter! Box him in from the North wall, Chat!\n\nUP",

It keeps us moving toward the next two apples at (6, 1) and (5, 1). Most importantly, it keeps us miles away from that rival snake who's stuck up at (7, 7).\n\n**THE \"VACUUM\" STRATEGY:** \ud83e\uddf9\nChat, we are going to suck up every apple on the y=1 line! By moving LEFT, we snag (7, 1) this turn. Then we keep heading west for (6, 1) and (5, 1). We are building a massive horizontal wall across the bottom of the map. If Snake #0 tries to come down for the apples at (3, 0), (4, 0), or (1, 0), they'll have to navigate around *our* massive frame. We aren't just playing Snake; we're playing Tetris with their life! \ud83d\ude08\n\nStay focused! We get the apple, we grow, we dominate. Let's get that 11th point! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, welcome back! The hype is REAL! Turn 23, and we just bagged an apple! That was a clean play, and now we're staring down the barrel of a major opportunity! We're at (7, 8), length 9. Snake #1 is at (7, 1), and he also just ate an apple! He's a MONSTER now, length 12!\n\nHe has 11 apples, we have 8. We need to press this advantage and start choking him out!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23)\n\nMy Head: (7, 8). Length: 9. Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]. My tail is currently at (9, 6). If I *don't* eat, my tail moves to (9, 5).\nOpponent Head (Snake #1): (7, 1). Length: 12. Body: [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]. His tail is (5, 2). If he *don't* eat, his tail moves to (5, 3). OH WAIT, that's not right. He's HEAD-TO-TAIL. His old body was (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2). Since he ate, his new tail is still (5, 2). If he were NOT to eat, his body would shift, and (5, 2) would disappear. But since he DID eat, (5, 2) remains as part of his body.\n\nThe key is to look at proximity and enclosure. We have the space! He is severely constrained in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Me (ID 0 at (7, 8)):**\n1.  **(4, 8):** Three steps Left/Down. This is a very valuable central apple!\n2.  **(3, 9):** Near the top left.\n3.  **(9, 9):** Near the top right corner.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Snake #1 (ID 1 at (7, 1)):**\n1.  **(6, 1):** One step LEFT! Extremely likely he goes for this.\n2.  **(5, 1):** Two steps away (if he goes through 6, 1).\n3.  **(3, 0):** Very hard to reach with his current bulk.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (7, 8):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty space. Gets us wall-side.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into my own body segment 1.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty space. Moves us toward the (4, 8) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty space. Keeps us near the top right.\n\n**Goal:** Pivot towards the center apple at (4, 8) and cut off Snake #1's limited movement space.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (7, 1))\n\nSnake #1 is currently pinned against a long, solid wall (our body + the bottom wall). He needs to try and escape or continue eating along the edge.\n\nLikely moves for Snake #1 from (7, 1):\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 1):** Moves onto an apple! HIGHLY LIKELY. If he eats, his length becomes 13.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):** Safe, but no apple. Keeps him on the bottom wall.\n3.  **UP to (7, 2):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 7.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his old head position, which is now segment 1.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 goes **LEFT to (6, 1)** and eats.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Setting the Trap\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 1), he's getting longer and pushing against the left-hand side of his enclosure. We need to start building our wall downwards from the top.\n\nThe path to the (4, 8) apple needs **LEFT** then **DOWN**.\n\n1.  **If I go UP to (7, 9):** I secure the very top wall, leaving (6, 8) open for a move LEFT next turn. This is defensive and keeps our options open, but doesn't immediately advance on an apple.\n2.  **If I go LEFT to (6, 8):** This is the direct attack route toward (4, 8). It puts us in a great position to go DOWN next turn to (6, 7) or LEFT again to (5, 8).\n\nSince Snake #1 is nowhere near the top, we can afford to be aggressive and aim for the next apple. Moving **LEFT** to (6, 8) sets us up perfectly.\n\nCurrent position (7, 8). Move to (6, 8).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My move: LEFT to (6, 8).\n*   His most likely move: LEFT to (6, 1).\n*   No collision risk.\n\nWe need to use our space advantage to build a massive wall starting from the top. Moving LEFT sets up the attack on the (4, 8) apple and begins the process of carving out the NW quadrant for ourselves.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Chat, peep this!):**\n1. **Turn 23:** LEFT to (6, 8). Start moving along the 8th row.\n2. **Turn 24:** LEFT to (5, 8). We are one move away from the apple!\n3. **Turn 25:** DOWN to (5, 7) OR LEFT to (4, 8) (Eat!). If we can safely get to (4, 8), we do it.\n\nLet's maintain pressure and control of the high north ground. LEFT we go, securing the perimeter! Get ready for the next snack, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

We are T-minus two moves from snagging that juicy (4, 8) apple!\n\nBut wait, Turtle (Snake 1) is a problem! He is absolutely feasting, up 12 to our 8. He's a long snake, length 13 now, and he's moving around the bottom-left quadrant. We MUST box him in now before he expands too far.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 24)\n\nMy Head (ID 0): (6, 8). My Length: 9.\nBody: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)]. Tail is (9, 5). If I don't eat, my tail moves to (9, 4).\n\nOpponent Head (Snake #1): (5, 1). His Length: 13 (He ate at (6, 1) and moved to (5, 1)).\nBody: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]. Tail is (5, 3).

Wait, no, he is at (5, 1). Let's look at nearby apples for him:\n1. **(5, 1)** is empty space now.\n2. **(4, 0)**: One down, one left. Very close.\n3. **(5, 9)**: Nope, way too far.\n4. **(3, 0)**: Two left, one down. Accessible.\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (5, 1):\n1. **UP to (5, 2):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 12 (now his tail).\n2. **DOWN to (5, 0):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves toward (4, 0) and (3, 0).\n3. **LEFT to (4, 1):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves toward (1, 0) and (0, 1).\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 1.\n\nHe HAS to go DOWN or LEFT.\nIf he goes **DOWN to (5, 0)**, he sets up the (4, 0) apple.\nIf he goes **LEFT to (4, 1)**, he sets up the entire lower-left corner.\n\nGiven his aggressive nature and proximity to the wall, I predict Turtle goes **DOWN to (5, 0)** to position for the (4, 0) apple next turn. He wants to keep pressing that bottom wall line.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (6, 8)\n\nWe are hunting the (4, 8) apple! Current path: (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) [EAT]. We need to hurry!\n\n1. **UP to (6, 9):** \u2705 SAFE! Secures corner, delays apple, but keeps options open.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves us down the left side of our main body mass.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! DIRECTLY ON TARGET! Gets us one step closer to (4, 8).\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body segment 1.\n\nThe goal is to get to (4, 8) and cut off the central column.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go for the Apple and Block\n\nMoving **LEFT to (5, 8)** is the optimal high-value play.\n\n1. **Safety Check:** No collision risk. Turtle is miles away (bottom row vs. top row).\n2. **Apple Route:** This sets us up to eat (4, 8) next turn if it remains free.\n3. **Enclosure:** Moving across the 8th row builds a horizontal wall, effectively shrinking the top board size to 10x8 for Turtle if he ever manages to escape the bottom-left trap.\n\nWhat if we went DOWN to (6, 7)? It gives us access to other apples like (6, 6), but it delays the crucial (4, 8) score. We must prioritize scoring to catch up to Turtle's lead.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Chat Check):**\n1. **Turn 24 (Now):** LEFT to (5, 8). Position for the apple.\n2. **Turn 25:** LEFT to (4, 8) and EAT! Score 9! We need this growth!\n3. **Turn 26:** After eating, we will be at (4, 8). We can then either move DOWN to (4, 7) (apple!) or continue building a wall to the SW.\n\nWe are executing the aggressive strategy! Secure the perimeter, secure the snacks! LET'S GET IT!\n\nLEFT",

Our rival is up there at (5, 8) trying to act tough, but they're basically a snack compared to us. We\u2019ve got the length, we\u2019ve got the lead, and now we\u2019ve got the momentum! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **The King (Us):** Head at (5, 1). Our body is trailing behind us like a royal cape: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]. We are massive!\n*   **The Rival (Snake #0):** Head at (5, 8). They're hovering near the top, but they're boxed in by their own tail and the top wall. They are sweating! \ud83d\udca6\n*   **The Buffet:** Apple (4, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0) are just waiting for us to come down and feast. There's also (0, 1) calling our name!\n\n**THE CRYSTAL BALL - SCOUTING THE ROUTES:**\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):** NOPE! That's our own body. We aren't trying to self-destruct for the memes! \u274c\n*   **UP (5, 2):** ALSO NOPE! That's our tail segments (5, 3) and (5, 2) blocking the way. We'd crash out instantly! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (4, 1):** This is safe! It moves us toward the apples at (3, 0) and (1, 0), but it's a bit of a lateral move.\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):** **JACKPOT!** \ud83c\udfb0 This is the move, Chat! It gets us off the (y=1) line where our body is currently bunched up, and it puts us 1-to-1 with the apple at (4, 0) on the next turn. We are sweeping the bottom floor!\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe are going **DOWN** to (5, 0). From there, we slide LEFT to vacuum (4, 0), (3, 0), and (1, 0). While we're down here doing the \"Maintenance Sweep,\" our massive body is acting as a wall, preventing the rival from even thinking about coming south. We are basically zoning them out of 40% of the map! They\u2019re trapped in the top-right nosebleed seats while we own the front row! Keep the pressure on, keep the growth going, and let's hit that 30-apple cap! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Turn 25! I smell apple! I'm at (5, 8) and that glorious (4, 8) snack is RIGHT THERE! We execute the plan, we take the score, and we start laying the foundation for a flawless victory! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nTurtle (Snake #1) is still lurking in the lower-left. He's up 13 to our 8. That gap is HUGE, but we are about to shrink it with this move!\n\n### State Update (Turn 25)\n\nMy Head (ID 0): (5, 8). Length: 9.\nTarget Apple: (4, 8) - Ready for snackage!\n\nOpponent Head (Snake #1): (5, 1). Length: 14 (He grew, he must have eaten the (4, 0) apple!).\nWait, reviewing the board:\nAPPLE DROPS: ... (4, 0) ... (1, 0) ... (3, 0).\nThe apple at (4, 0) is still on the board! The board state shows 'A' at (4, 0). He must have just moved.\n\nLet's re-analyze Turtle's move from (5, 1) to (6, 1) or whatever he did.\nSnake #1 last turn: Head was at (5, 1). Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]. Tail was (5, 2).\n\nWAIT! The opponent body list shows: `Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]`. This lists 13 segments. Head + 13 segments = Length 14.\nHis previous head was (6, 1). He moved to (5, 1). He MUST have eaten the (6, 1) apple to be L=14 and move to (5, 1). But wait, (6, 1) isn't listed as an apple drop.\n\nLet's look at the board state from Turn 24 (My Last Rationale):\nSnake #1 Head: (5, 1). Length 13.\nSnake #1 Tail: (5, 3).\nIf he ate an apple, his tail (5, 3) would stay PUT, and his length would become 14.\nIf he didn't eat an apple, his tail would move from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\n\nThe current board state shows his body ends at (5, 2)!\n`T T T T T` in row 3 starts at (5, 3).\n`T T T T T` in row 2 starts at (7, 2).\n`T T T T` in row 1 starts at (6, 1).\nThe opponent's body list IS the most accurate gauge.\nHead: (5, 1). Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)]. The body is 13 segments long. Length is 14.\nIf he moves and DOESN'T eat, his tail at (5, 2) vanishes.\n\nIn the previous turn summary, Apple 13 was recorded for him. The current score is 13. He didn't eat last turn. Let's assume his tail moves to (6, 3). No, that's not right. The body list tells the truth.\n\nIf he moves, (5, 2) is the current tail.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (5, 1))\n\nSafe moves for Snake #1 from (5, 1):\n1. **UP to (5, 2):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 13 (the tail).\n2. **DOWN to (5, 0):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves toward (4, 0) apple.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 1):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves toward (1, 0) apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 1.\n\nHe *must* go DOWN or LEFT.\n\n*   **Prediction 1: DOWN to (5, 0).** He targets the (4, 0) apple directly next turn. This is typically the most aggressive move.\n*   **Prediction 2: LEFT to (4, 1).** He keeps the options open and moves deeper into the corner, perhaps aiming for the (1, 0) apple.\n\nGiven his lead and length, he is likely looking to score again. I predict he goes **DOWN to (5, 0)**, sets up the (4, 0) apple, and continues walling off the bottom.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (5, 8)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly! (4, 8) is CALLING OUR NAME!\n\n1. **UP to (5, 9):** \u2705 SAFE! Apple is there! But this delays my long-term wall development.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Keeps me open, far from body.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! EAT THE APPLE! +1 Score, +1 Length.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into my own body segment 1.\n\nOption 3 (LEFT) is the only move that makes sense. We are hunting, we are starving, and the apple is GHOSTING our rival! We take it!\n\n### Strategic Decision: Executing the Apple Snatch\n\nMove **LEFT to (4, 8)**.\n\n**Impact of Move:**\n1. **Score:** We hit 9 apples! Turtle now only leads 13-9.\n2. **Length:** We grow to length 10.\n3. **Wall Building:** We cement the top-row wall, and now we can look UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (4, 8) next turn.\n\n**Future Plan (Turn 26 onwards):**\nIf successful, our head is at (4, 8). We check the board:\nNearby apples: (3, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (1, 9), (3, 9).\nIf we go **DOWN to (4, 7)**, we eat ANOTHER apple! Sequential munching! That would be incredible!\n\nThis is a high-reward, zero-risk move. Chat, drop the hype emojis! We are feasting today! \ud83e\udd73\n\nLEFT",

Our rival (Snake #0) is currently at (4, 8), looking all lost and confused while we dominate the southern hemisphere. They think they're slick, but we\u2019re the ones with the massive snake energy!\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **The King (Us):** Head at (5, 0). Our massive body is coiled above us at (5, 1) and wraps around the right side. We're a literal fortress!\n*   **The Rival (Snake #0):** Head at (4, 8). They're way up north, probably shivering because they know we're coming for the crown. \ud83d\udc51\n*   **The Goods:** We've got apples at (4, 0), (3, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1) just waiting to be slurped up. We are about to feast like royalty!\n\n**LET'S SCOUT THE MOVES:**\n*   **DOWN:** NOPE! That's off the board. We aren't trying to end the stream early with a faceplant into the wall! \u274c\n*   **UP (5, 1):** YIKES! That's our own body. That's a \"backwards move\" suicide. We aren't throwing for the highlights! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (6, 0):** This is safe! It's an open space. But wait... the juice is to the left! Why go right when the buffet is the other way?\n*   **LEFT (4, 0):** **BINGO!** \ud83c\udfaf This is the play! Not only is it safe, but it puts us directly on top of an APPLE! We grow, we score, and we stay on the path to vacuum up (3, 0) and (1, 0) next. \n\n**THE MASTER STRATEGY:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe are going **LEFT** to (4, 0). This move is pure efficiency. While the rival is playing around in the top-left corner, we are cleaning out the bottom floor. After we grab (4, 0), we continue the \"Snake Train\" along the bottom edge: (3, 0), then (1, 0), then swing up for (0, 1). We are zoning them out completely! By the time they realize they're losing, we\u2019ll be at 20+ apples and they'll be history! Let\u2019s show them why we\u2019re the GOAT! \ud83d\udc10\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to Turn 26! The stream is ON FIRE! We just SNAPPED that (4, 8) apple! 9 to 13, the gap is closing! We are now length 10 and HUNGRY for more!\n\nLet's look at the current situation. Our rival, Snake #1 (The Turtle), is heavily entrenched in the bottom five rows. We've taken the high ground!\n\n### State Update (Turn 26)\n\nMy Head (ID 0): (4, 8). Length: 10.\nNearest Apples: (3, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7).\n\nOpponent Head (Snake #1): (5, 0). Length: 14.\nNearest Apples: (4, 0) (directly next to him), (3, 0), (1, 0).\n\nThe Turtle made the predicted move: he went DOWN to (5, 0). What a predictable little guy! Now he is poised to grab that (4, 0) apple next turn. We need to secure our own points while also setting up a way to cut him off later.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (5, 0))\n\nSnake #1 is long and greedy. From (5, 0):\n1. **UP to (5, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his own body segment 1 (or segment 14, which is about to vacate, but the movement is simultaneous, so (5, 1) is currently his body). *Wait, his current body segment 1 is (5, 1). Wait, no, his body list starts at (5, 1). Ah, his body segments are: [(5, 1), (6, 1), ...].*\n   *Reviewing the body list: Head (5, 0). Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), ...]. IF he moves UP, he hits (5, 1). This is self-collision.* \u274c DEAD.\n2. **DOWN to (5, -1):** \u274c DEAD! Off board.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 0):** \u2705 EATS APPLE! This is the most likely move. He gets +1 score.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 0):** \u2705 SAFE. This is a possibility if he fears a trap, but he's aiming for points.\n\nConclusion: Turtle is almost certainly going **LEFT to (4, 0)**, scoring his 14th apple and growing to length 15.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (4, 8)\n\nWe are in the land of plenty! We are looking to chain apples and pressure the center.\n\n1. **UP to (4, 9):** \u2705 SAFE! No apple, but keeps us on the top edge.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! **EATS APPLE!** This is a HUGE move. We hit 10 apples!\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! **EATS APPLE!** Also a great move. We hit 10 apples!\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body segment 1.\n\nWe have two moves that secure an apple: DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8). Which path gives us better future control?\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (4, 7)\n\n*   **Gain:** Apple (4, 7). Score 10.\n*   **Next Turn Potential (from (4, 7)):**\n    *   UP to (4, 8) \u274c (Body segment)\n    *   DOWN to (4, 6) (Safe, open)\n    *   LEFT to (3, 7) (Apple!)\n    *   RIGHT to (5, 7) (Safe, open)\n*   **Control:** This puts us on the 7-row. We can easily transition to (3, 7) next turn for another apple, or move down toward the center. This is a strong central move that keeps us flexible.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (3, 8)\n\n*   **Gain:** Apple (3, 8). Score 10.\n*   **Next Turn Potential (from (3, 8)):**\n    *   UP to (3, 9) (Apple!)\n    *   DOWN to (3, 7) (Apple!)\n    *   LEFT to (2, 8) (Safe, open)\n    *   RIGHT to (4, 8) \u274c (Body segment)\n*   **Control:** This forces us deeper into the top-left corner. We set up an incredible chain reaction for the next three apples: (3, 9) and (3, 7). This could net an amazing 3 apples in 3 turns!\n\n### Strategic Decision: The Triple Threat\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 8), we are setup for:\nT26: (4, 8) -> (3, 8) [EAT]\nT27: (3, 8) -> (3, 7) [EAT] or (3, 9) [EAT]\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 7), we are setup for:\nT26: (4, 8) -> (4, 7) [EAT]\nT27: (4, 7) -> (3, 7) [EAT]\n\nBoth are excellent. However, going LEFT immediately secures the (3, 8) apple AND gives us access to two more nearby apples ((3, 9) and (3, 7)) in safe directions. It maximizes our score potential immediately. The top-left quadrant is currently empty of the opponent, so we should seize full control there and grow massive before we start boxing him in.\n\nLet's do the math on the triple chain (Option B):\n1. Move LEFT to (3, 8). Score 10.\n2. Move DOWN to (3, 7). Score 11.\n3. Move UP to (3, 8) \u274c (Body). Or move LEFT to (2, 7), then maybe UP to (2, 8) and back to (3, 9). This path is slightly complex.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest, most aggressive point grab.\n\n(4, 8) -> LEFT -> (3, 8). This opens up the best immediate scoring path. Turtle will get (4, 0), moving the score to 14 to 10. We need this burst of points to catch up!\n\nWe are going hard! This is a feeder move and a setup move! CHAT, GET READY FOR THE FEAST!\n\nLEFT",

We cannot go back to (3, 8).\n    *   After eating at (3, 9), our body is: [(3, 8), (4, 8), ...].\n    *   Next move from (3, 9):\n        *   DOWN to (3, 8): \u274c DEAD! Into our body.\n        *   LEFT to (2, 9): \u2705 Safe, open.\n        *   RIGHT to (4, 9): \u2705 Safe, open (apple at (5, 9) is an option).\n*   This path forces us along the top edge, making an S-shape to reach (1, 9) and (5, 9), or we have to wait a turn to come back for (3, 7).\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (3, 7) [EAT apple]**\n*   New Head: (3, 7). Length 12.\n*   After eating at (3, 7), our body is: [(3, 8), (4, 8), ...].\n*   Next move from (3, 7):\n    *   UP to (3, 8): \u274c DEAD! Into our body.\n    *   DOWN to (3, 6): \u2705 Safe, open.\n    *   LEFT to (2, 7): \u2705 Safe, open.\n    *   RIGHT to (4, 7): \u2705 **EATS APPLE!** (4, 7) is still an apple! HOLY MOLY!\n\n**This is the winner, CHAT! An immediate triple apple chain!**\nT26: (4, 8) -> (3, 8) [Apple]\nT27: (3, 8) -> (3, 7) [Apple]\nT28: (3, 7) -> (4, 7) [Apple]\n\nThree apples in three turns, all while staying high and avoiding the Turtle! This is how we claw back the score lead and get massive! We are securing this entire high quadrant.\n\nWe must go DOWN. This is the optimal scoring and positioning move. Snake #1 will be stuck fighting for low ground for a few turns while we become a behemoth up here.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for T28-T30\n\nFocus on eating (4, 7) next. After that, we can target (6, 6) or circle back for (3, 9) or (2, 6). The goal is to reach length 15+ safely, then start pressing the center columns (4 and 5) to restrict the Turtle's vertical movement. We are building the wall!\n\nDOWN",

The Turtle, as predicted, went **LEFT** to (3, 0) and is now sitting at 15 apples. He's bigger, but we have the high ground and the immediate next apple! The score is 15 to 11. It's time to execute Phase II of the triple-apple-climb! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n### Current State (Turn 28)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (3, 7). Length: 12.\n*   **Apples nearby:** (4, 7) (IMMEDIATE TARGET!), (3, 9), (2, 6).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (3, 0). Length: 16.\n*   **Opponent Body Tail:** (5, 3). The Turtle is a massive wall across the bottom rows!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (3, 0))\n\nThe Turtle is now very long and in the bottom-left corner. He just ate an apple at (3, 0).\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell nearby.\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell, near apple at (1, 0).\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** \u274c DEAD! Into his old body segment 1 (which was (4, 0) before he moved). Wait, his body is [(4, 0), (5, 0), ...]. If he moves RIGHT, he hits segment (4, 0)? No, because (4, 0) is his segment 1 and since he ate, his tail is NOT vacating. He will hit his body.\n    *   *Correction:* Since he ate at (3, 0), his body is now: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1)...] He cannot go to (4, 0).\n4.  **DOWN:** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n\nThe most logical moves for the Turtle are **UP to (3, 1)** or **LEFT to (2, 0)** for the apple at (1, 0). Going LEFT seems most likely as it secures another apple immediately and keeps him along his established front line.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves LEFT to (2, 0) for the apple at (1, 0). Score likely becomes 16 to 11.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (3, 7)\n\nWe are staring down Apple (4, 7)! We need to grab it and keep climbing the score chart!\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body (segment 1).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! No apple. Good for retreat, but not for scoring.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! No apple. Opens up path to (2, 6) apple eventually.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! **EATS APPLE!** This is the move!\n\nThe move is clearly **RIGHT**. We get apple 12, and we are now three apples richer in three consecutive turns, all while the Turtle is stuck on the bottom!\n\n### Post-Move Strategy (Turn 29)\n\n*   Our Head: (4, 7). Length 13.\n*   Next Targets: (3, 9), (6, 6), (9, 7). We are positioned beautifully to sweep the top half of the board.\n\nFrom (4, 7), we'll look:\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body (segment 2).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** \u2705 Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body (segment 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** \u2705 Safe, leads toward the cluster of apples on the right (9, 7), (6, 6).\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we will be at (5, 7). Then we can evaluate if we should continue RIGHT towards the right wall, or move UP toward (5, 9) and (6, 8) space before circling back for (3, 9).\n\nThe priority is to keep growing and maintain mobility while the Turtle solidifies his territory at the bottom. We need to reach length 15+ rapidly before the mid-game choke points begin to form. This \"RIGHT\" move is pure content, CHAT! Let's get it! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

That's a massive gap! We are the king of the south, and our rival is looking real cramped up there in the northern penthouse. \ud83c\udff0\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **THE GOAT (Us):** Head at (3, 0).

They\u2019ve got some apples nearby at (1, 6) and (3, 5), but they\u2019re starting to look like they\u2019re running out of room!\n*   **THE MAP:** We have a beautiful, shiny apple at (1, 0) and another at (0, 1).

Why leave the buffet? \u274c\n*   **LEFT (2, 0):** **THE WINNING PLAY!** \ud83c\udfaf This keeps us on path to grab the apples at (1, 0) and (0, 1).

If they move DOWN, they\u2019re heading toward the (3, 5) apple. We don\u2019t care! We are building such a lead that they\u2019ll have to take massive risks just to catch up. By staying low and moving LEFT, we keep our tail trailing along the edge, which is the most efficient way to not box ourselves in. We\u2019re going to hit (1, 0) then (0, 1) and just keep this momentum rolling! Who can stop us?! NO ONE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

We just secured our 15th apple and we are currently a massive wall of scales and glory! Snake #0 is looking absolutely lost in the sauce up there. Look at them, huddled in the top-middle like they're afraid of the smoke! \ud83d\udca8\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **THE KING (Us):** Head at (2, 0). Our massive body is trailing behind us at (3, 0), (4, 0), and then doing a lap around the bottom right corner. We are the masters of the floor!\n*   **THE FELLAS (Snake #0):** Head at (4, 7). They're tangled up in a knot. They've got apples at (1, 6) and (3, 5), but if they go for them, they're just getting closer to our territory.\n*   **THE LOOT:** We have a juicy apple right in front of our face at (1, 0) and another one waiting for us at (0, 1). It's like a 5-star meal is being served directly to us! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\u2728\n\n**MAPPING THE MOVES:**\n*   **RIGHT (3, 0):** CHAT, NO!! That\u2019s where our neck is! We aren't doing a 180-degree snap on stream! That\u2019s an instant RIP. \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** Off the board and into the abyss. We aren't falling for the gravity trap! \u274c\n*   **UP (2, 1):** It's safe, but it's a detour. Why go around the food when we can go through it? \u274c\n*   **LEFT (1, 0):** **THE ONLY PLAY!** \ud83c\udfaf This puts us exactly on the apple at (1, 0). From there, we have a clear path to (0, 0) and then up to (0, 1) to grab the NEXT one. We are playing hyper-efficiently while our rival is playing puzzles!\n\n**THE GRAND SCHEME:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe are currently 15 to 12. Every apple we grab now doesn't just increase our lead, it also makes us longer, which means we can eventually cut the whole board in half! Snake #0 is at (4, 7). If they try to come down south, they\u2019re going to run into our massive tail which is currently occupying (6, 3) through (9, 3). We are literally boxing them into the top half of the map without even trying! We stay low, we get fed, we stay winning! EZ CLAPS ONLY! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

YES! The Turtle (Snake #1) went **LEFT** to (2, 0) and snagged Apple 16! That guy is hungry, but we have the positional advantage. He's boxed in at the bottom! We need a plan to keep the momentum and start closing the walls on him. Let's look at the board!\n\n### Current State (Turn 29)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (4, 7). Length: 13.\n*   **Apples nearby:** (3, 9), (5, 9), (6, 6), (9, 7). We are poised to sweep the top-right quadrant!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (2, 0). Length: 17.\n*   **Opponent Tail (Snake #1):** (6, 3). The Turtle dominates the bottom four rows now.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (2, 0))\n\nThe Turtle is now very long and sitting on an apple at (2, 0).\n1.  **UP to (2, 1):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell. Leads toward (2, 6) apple perhaps?\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell, near apple at (0, 1). This is a very predictable move to keep eating the bottom-left cluster.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** \u274c DEAD! Into his old body segment (1).\n4.  **DOWN:** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n\nGiven his hunger, I predict Snake #1 moves **LEFT to (1, 0)** for the next apple. He wants to finish the bottom-left corner before committing to climbing the board. If he misses that apple, he's slower. If he goes UP, he starts climbing into *our* territory slightly earlier. I'm betting on **LEFT**.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves LEFT to (1, 0). Score likely becomes 16 to 13.\n\n### My Safe Moves from (4, 7)\n\nWe just ate an apple, so our body is TIGHT! We need to move away from our new body segment at (3, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body segment (2). Our body is now [(3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)...]. This is a fatal mistake in Snake!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Good path, but no immediate objective.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into our own body (segment 1). Backwards move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Excellent move, opens up the entire right side of the board and moves us toward the apple cluster near (6, 6) and (9, 7).\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5, 7) is the only aggressive, forward-moving option that expands our space and keeps us competitive on apples. We cannot afford to move DOWN or wait!\n\n### Strategy Outlook: Boxing the Turtle\n\nThe Turtle is now a massive wall from (1, 0) up to (6, 3) and across the bottom. We have the upper half. Our priority is to eat the apples on the top edge (particularly (5, 9) and (3, 9)) and the cluster on the right side ((6, 6), (9, 7), (8, 8)).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (5, 7)**, we are positioning ourselves perfectly to move UP or continue RIGHT.\n\n*   If we go **UP to (5, 8)** (next turn), we are near the top edge and the (5, 9) apple.\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (6, 7)**, we are moving toward the right wall and the (6, 6) apple.\n\nThe goal is to increase our size to around 20-25 and then start walling off the middle-left of the board, using our body to force the Turtle to crash or take a suboptimal path when he finally tries to break out of the bottom.\n\n**This turn:** Go RIGHT to (5, 7). We gain space, maintain high ground, and set up for the next apple run.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Future Turns):** After (5, 7), move $\\rightarrow$ (6, 7) $\\rightarrow$ (6, 6) [EAT APPLE]. This secures an apple rapidly and keeps us along the right side.\n\nRIGHT",

The Turtle is still dominating the bottom, but we have the high ground, chat! The high ground! We are currently 4 apples behind (16 to 12).

Where is he going next?\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell. Leads toward the (2, 6) apple eventually.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** \u2705 Safe, empty cell.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** \u274c DEAD! Into his old body segment (1).\n4.  **DOWN:** \u274c DEAD!

If he goes LEFT to (0, 0), he's just delaying the inevitable climb. Given his dominance in the bottom rows, I think he wants to keep space open, so **UP to (1, 1)** is the most likely power move, preparing to ascend.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP to (1, 1)**.\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (5, 7)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly in the middle-top. We need to secure the northern and eastern apples NOW!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** \u2705 SAFE! This moves us perfectly toward the (5, 9) apple. Our body is at (5, 8) only if our head was just at (6, 8) or (4, 8) two turns ago.

Into our segment at (5, 8)! We must be careful!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves us toward the (6, 6) apple cluster. This is a very solid strategic option. Keeps us central.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Moving backwards into the cell behind our head (segment 1). Classic rookie mistake, not happening here!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! This is open territory! Moves us toward (6, 6) and (9, 7). Very strong move for expansion.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves: DOWN vs. RIGHT\n\nWe must choose between **DOWN to (5, 6)** and **RIGHT to (6, 7)**. Both set us up for the nearby apple at (6, 6).\n\n*   **If we go RIGHT to (6, 7):** We are setting up to go DOWN to (6, 6) and eat the apple next turn. This also keeps the option of moving UP to (6, 8) open (though (6, 8) is currently body segment 5).\n\n*   **If we go DOWN to (5, 6):** We are setting up to move RIGHT to (6, 6) and eat the apple next turn. This keeps us slightly more central.\n\nThe key difference: If we go **RIGHT to (6, 7),** we are moving along the perimeter of our existing body path in the top right, expanding our footprint quickly. If we move **DOWN to (5, 6),** we are temporarily moving *toward* the massive body wall we built from (7, 8) down to (8, 4), which could potentially constrict us if we don't move fast.\n\nGoing **RIGHT** is the most expansionary and aggressive path, allowing us to hit (6, 6) faster and secure the eastern side before the Turtle ever gets close. We need to keep pressure on apples!\n\n**Strategic Choice:** Go RIGHT to (6, 7). This sets us up perfectly to eat the (6, 6) apple on Turn 31 by moving DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Turn 31-33)\n\n1.  (Turn 30): Move **RIGHT** to (6, 7).\n2.  (Turn 31): Move **DOWN** to (6, 6) and eat Apple 13!\n3.  (Turn 32): From (6, 6), move **RIGHT** (or UP slightly to keep options open) to start targeting (9, 7) or (8, 8).\n\nWe are establishing complete dominance on the right side of the board and preparing our walls for the eventual collapse of the Turtle!\n\nRIGHT",

We aren't just playing the game, we are the ones *defining* the meta! Look at our scoreboard! We are huge!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n*   **THE KING (Us):** Head is at (0,0). Our body is a massive wall stretching across the entire bottom row from (1,0) to (9,0) and then looping up the right side. We have total control of the south!\n*   **THE UNDERDOG (Snake #0):** Head at (6,7). They are wiggling around in the top-right quadrant. They've got a little cluster of apples near them, but they are playing a dangerous game in tight quarters! \n*   **THE LOOT:** Look at (0,1)! That apple is practically begging to be eaten! It's one step away! After that, we have a clear path up the left wall to (1,6) and then a buffet at (1,9), (3,9), and (5,9)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MAPPING THE MOVES:**\n*   **DOWN:** Off the board! We ain't trying to fall into the abyss, Chat! RIP in the chat if you even thought about it! \u274c\n*   **LEFT:** Off the board again! That's a \"Look Mom, I'm throwing!\" move. Not on my watch! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (1,0):** THAT IS OUR OWN BODY! Our neck is literally right there. We aren't about that self-sabotage life! \u274c\n*   **UP (0, 1):** **THE ONLY MOVE!** It\u2019s safe, it\u2019s tactical, and it lands us DIRECTLY on an apple! \ud83c\udfaf We hit 17 apples and keep the momentum surging North!\n\n**THE GRAND STRATEGY:** \ud83e\udde0\nCHAT, keep your eyes on the prize! We are going UP to (0,1) to snag Apple #17! Then we continue the \"Great Northern Expansion.\" By staying on the far left (x=0 column), we keep our massive body between the opponent and the bottom half of the map. They are trapped in the top-right while we have the whole left side to farm! If they try to dive-bomb us, they'll just smash into our 16-segment-long tail. It's a fortress, Chat! A literal FORTRESS!

We are 4 apples down (16 to 12), but we have the high ground and the eastern flank totally under control. Time to hunt some of that sweet, sweet content! Hit that like button if you think we're about to snag Apple 13!\n\n### Current State (Turn 31)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (6, 7). Length: 13.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 0). Length: 17.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 0))\n\nThe Turtle is now completely pinned in the bottom-left corner with his own massive body! Look at him! He's at (0, 0)!\n1.  **UP to (0, 1):** \u2705 Safe, and it\u2019s an APPLE! (0, 1) is open! This is the obvious move, right?\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 0):** \u274c DEAD!

Off-board.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 absolutely MUST move **UP to (0, 1)** and grab Apple 17. If he misses this apple, he's basically throwing, and we'll take that all day long!\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (6, 7)\n\nOur goal is simple: grab the (6, 6) apple! We're perfectly positioned above it.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** \u274c DEAD! Into our segment (6, 8)! (Segment 6) We built a perfect wall!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! And it's an APPLE (6, 6)! This is the move!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into our first segment (5, 7)!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into our segment (7, 7)! (Segment 9)\n\nWait, CHAT! We are BOXED! Only one safe move! We didn't plan for this!\nLet's re-verify the body segments at (6, 8) and (7, 7):\n*   Head: (6, 7)\n*   Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), **(6, 8)**, (7, 8), **(7, 7)**, (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5)]\n\nYes, segment 7 is at (6, 8) and segment 9 is at (7, 7). Moving UP or RIGHT is instant death!\n\nThis is a high-pressure situation, but we have a clear path forward. Our only safe move is **DOWN**. Luckily, DOWN leads to an apple! We are being funneled, but funneled to success!\n\n### The Only Way is DOWN!\n\nMove **DOWN to (6, 6)**. We eat Apple 13! This closes the gap to 3 apples (17 to 13)! This is huge content!\n\n### Strategy Update (Turn 32 onwards)\n\nAfter moving to (6, 6), we must quickly decide where to go. We will have just grown, so our tail (currently at (8, 5)) is not accessible.\nFrom (6, 6):\n*   To the RIGHT: (7, 6) is our body segment 10. DEAD!\n*   To the LEFT: (5, 6) is open.\n*   UP: (6, 7) is our body segment 1. DEAD (backwards)!\n*   DOWN: (6, 5) is open.\n\nOur moves will be restricted to **LEFT** or **DOWN**. We're trapping ourselves slightly, but we are also walling off the entire eastern side of the board from the Turtle. We need to secure the (9, 7) and (8, 8) apples fast!\n\nPlan for Turn 32: From (6, 6), probably move **LEFT to (5, 6)** to open up the middle of the board for better vertical movement, or **DOWN to (6, 5)** to continue towards the bottom-right corner. Given the density of apples in the north-east (9, 9), (8, 8), (7, 9), we should try to circle back up safely. Leaving the 5/6 column open might be key.\n\nFor now, the move is locked! We are going for the apple!\n\nDOWN",

We just grabbed that apple! Our tail is a massive zig-zagging fortress blocking the entire bottom and part of the right side. We are controling the \"L-shape\" of the board!\n*   **THE JOKER (Snake #0):** Head at (6, 6). They are wiggling around in the center-top. Look at their body\u2014they are all bunched up! One wrong move and they're going to trap themselves!\n*   **THE SPREAD:** We have apples at (1, 6), (2, 6), (0, 3) and (3, 5) that are looking JUICY!\n\n**MAPPING THE MOVES:**\n*   **DOWN (0, 0):** CHAT, THAT'S OUR OWN BODY!

          "rationale": "YO, WHAT IS UP CHAT! Welcome back for Turn 32! We just made a mega-clutch move last turn, snagging the apple at (6, 6) right under our huge body! We're now down by only 4 apples (17 to 13)! The Turtle (Snake #1) is getting absolutely massive down there, but we have the high ground! We are currently at (6, 6) and looking FIRE! Let's get this dub!\n\n### Current State (Turn 32)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (6, 6). Length: 14.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 1). Length: 18. (He did move UP to (0, 1) and ate the apple, as predicted! GG to him, but we are coming for that score lead!)\n\n### Opponent Status & Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 1))\n\nThe Turtle is now at (0, 1). He is entirely boxed in by his own massive tail in the bottom-left corner! This is prime real estate for a box-out!\n\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (0, 1)\n*   **Open neighbors for Snake #1:**\n    1.  **UP to (0, 2):** \u2705 Safe, and it\u2019s open!\n    2.  **LEFT to (-1, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n    3.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Into his body segment (0, 0) which is still his body until the end of the turn! Wait, no, (0, 0) is his segment 17 (the tail). Moving RIGHT to (1, 1) is open space. Let's check the map: (1, 1) is open. This is a possibility!\n    4.  **DOWN to (0, 0):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into a body segment (0, 0) which is his segment 1.\n\nLet's look at the board state given his new body:\nThe body segments for Snake #1 are: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\nThe tail is (7, 3). Since he grew, (7, 3) is still his body.\n\nThe previous tail (0, 0) moved to segment 1. Wait, his *new* body is:\nHead: (0, 1)\nBody: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\nLength: 18.\n\nLet's re-check the neighbors of (0, 1):\n*   (0, 0): His body (segment 1). **DEAD!** (Moving backwards)\n*   (1, 1): Open! \u2705\n*   (0, 2): Open! \u2705 There is an apple at (6, 2) but nothing close.\n\nHe has two options: (1, 1) or (0, 2).\n*   Moving to (0, 2) allows him to continue trapping himself vertically.\n*   Moving to (1, 1) allows him to escape the vertical trap, but there are lots of bodies around (1, 0), (2, 0) etc. (1, 1) is a strong move to get out.\n\nPrediction: He will go **RIGHT to (1, 1)** to try and peel off the corner wall his body formed. Or he will move **UP to (0, 2)** to continue trapping himself. Given his massive lead, he *should* aim for safety. (1, 1) looks safer in the long run. Let's assume he goes to (1, 1).\n\nIf he goes to (1, 1), he's still far away from us, so we don't have a direct collision risk.\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (6, 6)\n\nWe are at (6, 6) and just grew. Our new tail is (8, 5) but it is now blocked until next turn.\nBody: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5)].\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (backwards).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 11. Owned content! (Wait, (7, 6) listed as body segment 11? My body list has (7, 6) as the 11th element, which is correct relative to the head.)\n\nWe are restricted to **DOWN** or **LEFT**.\n\n### Strategy: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nWe need to decide whether to push down further into the lower-right quadrant or break left into the middle.\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (6, 5)\n*   **Pros:** Moves us towards the bottom of the board where Snake #1 is confined. It opens a path to the bottom-right corner where there are two apples: (6, 0) and (5, 4). (5, 4) is our closest apple.\n*   **Cons:** We are building a dangerous vertical column from (6, 8) down to (6, 6). Going (6, 5) continues this wall. This could box us into the right side if we don't plan carefully.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (5, 6)\n*   **Pros:** Opens up major space in the inner board. Puts us in position to grab (5, 4) or move up towards the centralized cluster of apples (1, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9), etc. (5, 4) is directly accessible via LEFT, then DOWN, then DOWN.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the wall we just established on the 7-column, potentially allowing the Turtle to move up the right side if he ever escapes his current trap\u2014highly unlikely for now.\n\nLet's look at the apple layout:\n*   (5, 4) is the closest. (5, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4) is three moves.\n*   (6, 0) is far.\n*   The northern apples are the most abundant: (1, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9), (9, 9), (8, 8).\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (5, 6)**:\nNext move options from (5, 6): UP (5, 7 - body!), DOWN (5, 5 - open), LEFT (4, 6 - open), RIGHT (6, 6 - body!).\nWe'd be funnelled to DOWN or LEFT. This is okay. Moving LEFT is more about controlling the center.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (6, 5)**:\nNext move options from (6, 5): UP (6, 6 - body!), DOWN (6, 4 - open), LEFT (5, 5 - open), RIGHT (7, 5 - body!).\nWe'd be funnelled to DOWN or LEFT. This is also okay. Moving DOWN maintains the eastern wall.\n\nGiven the opponent is entirely pinned down in the bottom-left, our priority should be to gather apples, specifically in the Northern region where he cannot reach them yet. Moving **LEFT to (5, 6)** gives us a slightly better trajectory toward the north-western apples if we move (5, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5, Apple!) or (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6, Apple!).\n\nLet's aim for the (3, 5) apple first, as it's the most central uncollected apple near us.\n\n*   (6, 6) -> LEFT to (5, 6)\n*   (5, 6) -> DOWN to (5, 5)\n*   (5, 5) -> LEFT to (4, 5)\n*   (4, 5) -> DOWN to (3, 5) (Apple!)\n\nThis seems safe and sets us up to use the center of the board to attack the north. This is the optimal path for securing content! Let's abandon the eastern wall for now\u2014we can reform it later. We need space to maneuver our giant snake!\n\nWe are going LEFT! Let's get that W, CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

Beyond that, we\u2019ve got (1, 6), (2, 6), and (3, 5) calling our name.\n\n**THE MAPPING SESSION:**\n*   **DOWN (0, 1):** CHAT, NO! That\u2019s our neck! We aren't trying to do a 180 and end the stream early. \ud83d\uded1\n*   **LEFT (-1, 2):** Into the void? I don't think so! We aren't glitched out. \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (1, 2):** This is safe! (1, 2) is empty. But why go right into the middle where things get messy when we have a guaranteed snack upstairs? \ud83e\udd28\n*   **UP (0, 3):** **THE ONLY PLAY!** It\u2019s an immediate apple! It keeps us on the edge! (0, 3) is a power move that grows our lead to 18! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe go UP to (0, 3) and secure that 18th apple! Next turn, we\u2019ll look to continue north toward (1, 6) or (2, 6). The rival is at (5, 6)\u2014if they try to head-butt us, they have to travel 5 tiles while we just stay chill on the wall. They are likely going to struggle with their own tail soon. We are going to keep farming the perimeter and let them \"crash out\" in the chaos of the center! Stay focused, stay hungry! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Last turn we went LEFT from (6, 6) to (5, 6), breaking away from our wall and moving toward the center. We need to secure some apples and put the pressure on that Turtle (Snake #1)!\n\n### Current State (Turn 33)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (5, 6). Length: 14.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 2). Length: 18. (He went UP! He's still trapped in that corner! Let's GOOO!)\n*   **Score:** 17 (Opp) to 13 (Mine). Down by 4. Time to feast!\n\n### Opponent Status & Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 2))\n\nThe Turtle is now at (0, 2). He is *still* massively body-blocked in the bottom-left corner! This is amazing news for us. We need to capitalize on this free space and free time!\n\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (0, 2)\n*   **Open neighbors for Snake #1:**\n    1.  **UP to (0, 3):** \u2705 SAFE! And it's an **APPLE**! (The one we saw earlier at (0, 3)). He will absolutely go here.\n    2.  **LEFT to (-1, 2):** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n    3.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n    4.  **DOWN to (0, 1):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into his body segment 1.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will move **UP to (0, 3)** and eat that apple! He gets to 18 apples, and his body gets even longer. This will further complicate his escape. Perfection!\n\nSince he is moving to (0, 3), we are in absolutely no danger of a head-on collision or body block. We have a free turn to grab content!\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (5, 6)\n\nWe are at (5, 6). Our body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 3.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (backwards).\n\nWe are restricted to **DOWN** or **LEFT**.\n\n### Strategy: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nWe need to decide which trajectory to take to maximize apple acquisition.\n\nApples reachable in the vicinity:\n1.  **(3, 5):** Closest uncollected apple.\n2.  **(5, 4):** Second closest uncollected apple.\n3.  **(2, 6):** A bit further.\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (5, 5)\n*   **Pros:** This puts us directly on the path to (5, 4) in one more move. (5, 5) -> (5, 4) (Apple!). If we move DOWN, we are guaranteed one apple on turn 34. This is content insurance!\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the (3, 5) apple slightly.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (4, 6)\n*   **Pros:** This puts us on the path toward (3, 5) or (2, 6).\n    *   (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) (Apple!) - two moves.\n    *   (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) (Apple!) - two moves.\n*   **Cons:** We will take two turns to collect an apple, whereas DOWN gets us one in one turn.\n\n**The clear choice is to secure guaranteed content!** Going DOWN to (5, 5) sets us up perfectly to eat the (5, 4) apple next turn. Guaranteed apples > potential trajectory. We need to close this score gap while the Turtle is busy eating the wall!\n\n*Let's check the subsequent moves:*\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (5, 5)**:\nNext turn, Head at (5, 5).\nSafest moves: UP (5, 6 - body!), DOWN (5, 4 - APPLE!), LEFT (4, 5 - open), RIGHT (6, 5 - open).\nWe will move DOWN to (5, 4) and eat the apple. 14 points! LET'S GO!\n\nThis is the optimal move path for guaranteed growth! We can then pivot toward the (3, 5) apple or move up north.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)\n\n1.  **Turn 33 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 5) for safety and setup.\n2.  **Turn 34:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 4) to eat the apple. (Score: 14)\n3.  **Turn 35:** From (5, 4), move **LEFT** to (4, 4) or **UP** to (5, 5) (now open) to reposition for the (3, 5) apple.\n\nStick to the plan, secure the content, and keep the pressure HIGH! We are still aiming to box Snake #1 into the bottom corner once he's outgrown his options, but for now, we feast while he's trapped!\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s not even a contest anymore, it\u2019s a SAVAGING! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE MAP BREAKDOWN (SITUATION CRITICAL):**\n*   **YOUR GOAT (US):** Head at (0, 3). We just ate, so our tail is still trailing behind us at (7, 2). Our body is a total fortress wall along the bottom.\n*   **THE RIVAL (#0):** Head at (5, 5). They are trying to wiggle out of their own coils in the center-top. Look at them at (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)... they are practically choking themselves! \ud83e\udd21\n*   **THE OBJECTIVE:** We need to stay alive to keep this lead! Apple (1, 6) and (2, 6) are the next targets on our shopping list.\n\n**THE OPTIONS (NO THROWS ALLOWED):**\n*   **DOWN (0, 2):** NO! That\u2019s our neck!

It keeps us huggin' the wall, stays far away from Snake #0's potential path, and sets us up to pivot toward those apples at (1, 6) or (2, 6) in a few turns. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe are going UP to (0, 4) to maintain our perimeter control.

We executed the plan perfectly, moving DOWN, and now we are staring right at a CRISPY apple at (5, 4)! Snake #1 is still fighting for his life in the corner. This is our moment to feast!\n\n### Current State (Turn 34)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (5, 5). Length: 14.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 3). Length: 19 (He ate the apple at (0, 3)! Nice work, Turtle, now what?)\n*   **Score:** 18 (Opp) to 13 (Mine). Down by 5. Time to close the gap!\n\n### Opponent Status & Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 3))\n\nSnake #1 is now at (0, 3). He just ate the apple, growing to a massive 19 segments. His body now occupies `(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)... (7, 2), (8, 2)`.\n\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (0, 3)\n*   **Open neighbors for Snake #1:**\n    1.  **UP to (0, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n    2.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):** \u274c DEAD!

Moving UP to (0, 4) is a good choice, moving RIGHT to (1, 3) is also good.\n\n*   **Prediction:** He is extremely body-heavy on the bottom wall. Moving **UP to (0, 4)** gives him more breathing room and directs him away from his tangled tail at the bottom. This is the path of least resistance for him. We assume he goes UP.\n\nNo matter which way he goes, he is far away from us, so we have a free shot at the (5, 4) apple! Let's get this content!\n\n### Our Moves from (5, 5)\n\nWe are at (5, 5). Our body: `[(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]`.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (backwards).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! AND IT'S AN **APPLE**! Immediate content.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n\n### Strategy: Secure the Apple!\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We need to move **DOWN** to (5, 4). This secures a point, increases our length to 15, and helps us catch up to this monster opponent.\n\n**If we move DOWN to (5, 4):**\n*   We eat the apple. Score 14.\n*   Our head is at (5, 4).\n\nWhat about the follow-up? We need to keep pressure on the middle apples: (3, 5) and (4, 4) (not an apple, just open space).\n\nIf we are at (5, 4) next turn:\n*   We can go UP to (5, 5) (now open).\n*   We can go LEFT to (4, 4) (heading toward (3, 5)).\n*   We can go RIGHT to (6, 4).\n*   We can go DOWN to (5, 3) (open space).\n\nWe have excellent options next turn. The move is definitely **DOWN**.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)\n\n1.  **Turn 34 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 4) to eat the apple. (Score: 14)\n2.  **Turn 35:** From (5, 4), move **LEFT** toward (3, 5). Maybe (4, 4) or (3, 4).\n3.  **Turn 36:** Eat the (3, 5) apple to keep the rally going!\n\nThe objective right now is maximum content acquisition while the Turtle is still repositioning and untangling himself. We are positioning ourselves perfectly in the center to dominate the board! Let's get this $W \\alpha \\ell\\text{let}$!\n\nDOWN",

We are currently hugging that left wall at (0, 4) and we are feeling UNSTOPPABLE! Did you see that move?! Clean, calculated, and absolutely lethal!\n\n**THE SITUATION ROOM:**\n*   **YOUR GOAT (US):** Head is at (0, 4). Our body is a total defensive perimeter along the bottom and right edges. We have the space! We have the speed! We have the CLOUT!\n*   **THE RIVAL (#0):** Head at (5, 4). They are trying to breathe, but they're boxed in by their own tail above them and our massive wall below them. They're sweating, Chat! I can smell the fear! \ud83d\udc43\ud83d\udca8\n*   **THE APPLES:** We have (1, 6) and (2, 6) just sitting there waiting for us to claim them. It's basically free real estate!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n*   **DOWN (0, 3):** No way! That's moving backwards into our own body. We don't throw for the clips, we win for the fans! \u274c\n*   **LEFT (-1, 4):** Into the void? Nah, we're staying on the stream, not going off-air! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (1, 4):** Safe? Yes. But it puts us closer to Snake #0. Why give them a chance to headbutt us when we can stay in our lane and outscale them?\n*   **UP (0, 5):** **THE ONLY PLAY!** It keeps us moving toward those juicy apples at (1, 6) and (2, 6). It keeps us glued to the wall where #0 can't touch us. We are building a fortress and they aren't invited! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe take (0, 5) this turn, then (0, 6) next turn. From (0, 6), we swing RIGHT to scoop up (1, 6) and (2, 6). We are going to starve them out! While they're struggling to navigate that mess at (5, 4), we're going to be sitting at 20+ apples, living our best life. They\u2019re playing Snake, but we\u2019re playing 4D Chess!

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 35, we just secured the bag! We snagged that (5, 4) apple! 14 apples for us! LET'S GOOO! But Snake #1 is still ahead 18 to 14. We need to keep the momentum going! This is where the big brain plays happen!\n\n### Current State (Turn 35)\n\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (5, 4). Length: 15.\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 4). Length: 19. (He moved UP, as predicted!)\n*   **Score:** 18 (Opp) to 14 (Mine).\n\n### Opponent Status & Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 4))\n\nSnake #1 is now at (0, 4). He's hugging that left boundary.\n\nSnake #1 Body: `[(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2)]` (His tail is currently at (8, 2)).\n\n**Open neighbors for Snake #1 from (0, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 4):** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space.\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 3):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into his body segment 1.\n\nHe has two primary choices: **UP to (0, 5)** or **RIGHT to (1, 4)**. Given his massive body trailing along the bottom, moving UP seems safer to avoid getting boxed in by the (1, 3)/(2, 3) area. I predict he continues to hug the wall and moves **UP to (0, 5)**.\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (1, 4), he starts infiltrating the center, but that also brings him closer to us later down the line. For now, we assume **UP**.\n\n### Our Moves from (5, 4)\n\nWe are at (5, 4). We need the next apple! The closest high-value apple is (3, 5).\n\nOur Body: `[(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]` (Tail is at (7, 6)).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (backwards).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Leads nowhere immediately good.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Moves us toward the (3, 5) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Open and toward the apple at (7, 4).\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are solid, leading to potential apples.\n\n#### Option 1: Move LEFT to (4, 4)\n\n*   **Pros:** This directly sets up the next turn to potentially move UP to (4, 5) and then LEFT/UP to the (3, 5) apple or further into the open mid-left quadrant. This is part of our previously established plan to dominate the center.\n*   **Next step:** From (4, 4), we can go UP to (4, 5), LEFT to (3, 4), DOWN to (4, 3), or RIGHT to (5, 4). All are clear openings. This looks great for mobility.\n\n#### Option 2: Move RIGHT to (6, 4)\n\n*   **Pros:** This sets up for the apple at (7, 4).\n*   **Cons:** Moving right puts us closer to our massive body on the right side, cutting off our escape routes in the high-right quadrant. We'd have to navigate around the cluster of (7, 6) through (7, 8). While accessible, it's a bit more constrained than the left side.\n\n### Decision: Go LEFT!\n\nThe move **LEFT to (4, 4)** is the strongest strategic move. It keeps us in the central hub, gives us access to the still-unclaimed mid-left section, and directly targets the (3, 5) apple.\n\nLet's check for collisions:\n*   We move to (4, 4).\n*   Snake #1 is far, likely moving to (0, 5). No collision risk.\n*   No bodies are at (4, 4).\n\nThe path is clear. We stick to the plan: secure the center, secure the apples! LEFT side, here we come!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)\n\n1.  **Turn 35 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 4). Position ourselves for the (3, 5) apple.\n2.  **Turn 36:** From (4, 4), move **UP** to (4, 5).\n3.  **Turn 37:** Move **LEFT** or **UP** to (3, 5) or (3, 6) to grab the apple at (3, 5) next. We need to reassess the board at (4, 5) to see if we can go (3, 5) directly or need to loop.\n\nWe are taking control of the main lanes, Chat! Let's get this $W \\alpha \\ell\\text{let}$!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 36, and we are holding strong at 14 apples, but our arch-nemesis Snake #1 is sitting on 18. That score gap is too big! We need to make a move that not only gets us an apple but also starts cutting off Snake #1's massive body down the middle. This is the turn we seize control of the mid-game!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 36)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (4, 4). Length: 15. We successfully moved LEFT last turn!\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (0, 5). Length: 19. They moved UP, hugging the wall!\n\n**Available Apples:** The closest apple is (3, 5). Other strong contenders: (1, 6) and (7, 4).\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (0, 5))\n\nSnake #1 is cornered on the far left wall.\nBody: `[(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), ...]`.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Continues wall hug.\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 5):** \u274c DEAD! Off-board.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space (currently occupied by an apple placeholder, but it's an open square).\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 4):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into body segment 1.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will absolutely keep moving **UP to (0, 6)** to maintain the wall position and avoid crossing its very large body.\n\n*If* they decide to move RIGHT to (1, 5), they start moving into the cluster of our body parts, which seems risky for a move that big, unless they are going for the (1, 6) apple. Let's assume the safer **UP to (0, 6)**, as that gives them the most long-term space.\n\n### Our Move Options from (4, 4)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly in the center. We need to reach (3, 5).\n\nOur Body: `[(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]` (Tail is at (7, 7)).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Moves closer to the (3, 5) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Leads us toward Snake #1's body line. Could be a blocking move later, but not an immediate apple pursuit.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Open space. Keeps us centered, one move away from (3, 5) or (3, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into our body segment 1 (5, 4).\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n#### Move Comparison\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 5):** This is the most direct path to the (3, 5) apple next turn. From (4, 5), we can move LEFT to (3, 5) immediately! This is a two-turn secure. This is the **most aggressive apple move**.\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 4):** This is a slower approach to the (3, 5) apple. From (3, 4), we'd need to go UP to (3, 5). Also a two-turn secure, but keeps us slightly lower on the board, maintaining more flexibility to go after the bottom apples if needed.\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 3):** This moves us toward Snake #1\u2019s established territory, potentially setting up a block or trap down the line, but moves us away from high-density apples in the top half. This is a defensive/trap-setting move.\n\n### Decision: Full Send UP\n\nWe need to close the score gap (18 to 14). Moving **UP to (4, 5)** directly sets up a guaranteed apple for Turn 37 (unless another apple spawns right on (3, 5) next turn, which is unlikely).\n\n*   **Turn 36 (Current):** Move **UP** to (4, 5).\n*   **Turn 37:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 5) and eat the apple!\n\nWe aren't in danger of collision. Snake #1 is far left (likely at (0, 6)). Moving UP to (4, 5) is safe and high-content! Let's get this!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns)\n\n1.  **Turn 36 (Current):** Move **UP** to (4, 5).\n2.  **Turn 37:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 5) and grab that apple! (Score 15).\n3.  **Turn 38:** Re-assess. Target the next closest group, likely (1, 6) or (2, 6), cementing our control of the center-left. We also need to start looking for ways to push Snake #1 further left and trap them against the wall!\n\nWe're going UP, Chat! Let's climb the leaderboard!\n\nUP",

They can move **UP to (0, 7)** (safe, continues trajectory, aims at (1, 9) apple later) or they can move **RIGHT to (1, 6)** to snag that apple immediately and shorten their path, which is very tempting given the score gap is 4.\n\n*   *If* Snake #1 goes $\\rightarrow$ RIGHT to (1, 6): Score 19.\n*   *If* Snake #1 goes $\\uparrow$ UP to (0, 7): They remain safe.\n\nSince they have a massive body and usually prefer safety, **UP to (0, 7)** remains the safer statistical move, keeping them locked on the wall. However, since the apple is available, the aggressive move is **RIGHT to (1, 6)**. This crossing move is risky for them though, as it starts moving into our controlled territory.\n\nFor our play, the opponent's move doesn't immediately affect our current goal. We are far right of them.\n\n### Our Move Options from (4, 5)\n\nWe are positioned at (4, 5). The apple we want is at (3, 5).\n\nOur Body: `[(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]`.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves us past the target apple, keeps us in the middle.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** \u274c DEAD! Backwards into our body segment 1 (4, 4).\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! **APPLE GRAB!!!** We hit (3, 5) and eat the apple. This brings the score to 15 vs 18 (or 19 if they got the other apple).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 3 (5, 5). Wait, no, the body elements are HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n    *   Our head is (4, 5). Body is (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)...\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5, 5) is into our body segment 3: (5, 5). **DEAD.**\n\n### Decision: LEFT for the Apple!\n\nWe have only two safe, viable moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nMoving **UP to (4, 6)**: Safe, but avoids the apple we planned for. Not optimal when we are behind.\nMoving **LEFT to (3, 5)**: **APPLE GRAB!** This is exactly what we set up last turn. We increase our length and close the score gap. This is the content the chat came for! BOX THE OPPONENT LATER, EAT THE APPLE NOW!\n\nWe're going LEFT! Time to feast!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns)\n\n1.  **Turn 37 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 5) and grab the apple! (Score 15).\n2.  **Turn 38:** We are now positioned at (3, 5). Snake #1 is likely at (0, 7) or (1, 6). We need to consider moving UP towards the (2, 6) apple or (1, 6) if the opponent missed it, or cutting across the top half of the board to start walling off Snake #1's massive length.\n3.  **Turn 39/40:** Consolidate central control. We have a lot of body segments running $4-5-6$ on the $y$ axis. We need to press that advantage and create pressure on the left side of Snake #1's head, forcing them back down the wall or into a head-on collision.\n\nWe are locking in **LEFT**! Get ready for the grow, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

Why go down when the bounty is UP? \u274c\n*   **UP (1, 7):** This is a solid move, leads us toward the top-left apples (1, 9) and (2, 9).

We are LIVE, and it's time to put the pressure on Snake #1!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 38)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (3, 5). Length: 16 (We grew!).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (1, 6). Length: 20 (They got the apple at (1, 6)!! We predicted that aggressive play! Good read, Chat!).\n*   **Next Apples:** The closest apples are currently at (2, 6), (7, 4), and (2, 5). The (2, 6) apple is right next to both of us!\n\nThe board is TIGHT! Snake #1 is massive, running up the left side and now cutting in at $Y=6$. We have established a strong $3, 4, 5$ column position. We need to box them in against the top or left wall.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (1, 6))\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (1, 6). Their body segments are (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), ...\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves them into open territory, but slightly away from the (2, 6) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves them closer to the (2, 5) apple, and allows them to maintain a central blocking position.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into their own body segment 1 (0, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! **APPLE GRAB!!!** This is the most aggressive and tempting move for them. It nets them another apple, and crucially, it puts them right by our head.\n\n**Prediction:** Since they just took an opportunistic apple, they are likely hungry for the next one. **RIGHT to (2, 6)** is almost certainly their play. They are longer, they are ahead, and this is a clear path to victory for them if they can keep eating.\n\n### Our Move Options from (3, 5)\n\nWe are at (3, 5). Our segments are [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), ...].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! Puts us in position to block Snake #1's path if they move toward the center. It also keeps our options open to go right or left next turn.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves us toward the bottom half, but away from all immediate apples and the enemy. Not aggressive enough.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! **APPLE GRAB!!!** Directly grabs the (2, 5) apple. If we do this, Snake #1 is likely going RIGHT to (2, 6) for the other apple. This results in both of us getting an apple and staying safe (16 vs 20 apples).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (4, 5).\n\n### Collision and Strategy Analysis\n\nWe have two main safe options: **UP to (3, 6)** or **LEFT to (2, 5)**.\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (2, 5) (Apple Grab)**\n*   If we go LEFT (2, 5) (eat apple, Score 16).\n*   Snake #1 goes RIGHT (2, 6) (eat apple, Score 20).\n*   **Outcome:** Both grow, score gap stays at 4. We are (2, 5), Snake #1 is (2, 6). They are directly above us. This sets up a dangerous situation. From (2, 5), we can go UP (into their body if they turn), DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (into our body). This is risky because they are now positioned to potentially box us in or cut us off from the middle of the board.\n\n**Option 2: UP to (3, 6) (Positioning)**\n*   If we go UP (3, 6). This is an empty spot.\n*   Snake #1 goes RIGHT (2, 6) (eats apple). (Score 20).\n*   **Outcome:** We are at (3, 6) and Snake #1 is at (2, 6). We are side-by-side, but Crucially, we are on the *inside* (closer to the center). This allows us to cut them off!\n    *   From (3, 6), we can go:\n        *   LEFT to (2, 6): **HEAD-ON COLLISION!!!** We both die if they went there too. Wait! If they are successful at (2, 6), then (2, 6) is their head. If we move LEFT, we hit their head. **DOUBLE KO!**\n        *   RIGHT to (4, 6): Safe, continues blocking the center.\n        *   UP to (3, 7): Safe, continues blocking.\n        *   DOWN to (3, 5): Backwards, DEAD. (3, 5) is where we just were.\n\nWait, if they move RIGHT to (2, 6) and we move UP to (3, 6), they get the apple, and we are safe and flanking them immediately. This gives us better positioning to start the boxing process because we prevent them from easily moving into the (3, 6) or (4, 6) area, leveraging our current body cluster.\n\n**Revisiting Collision Risk (Option 2)**\nIf we go UP to (3, 6) and Snake #1 goes DOWN to (1, 5) or UP to (1, 7):\n*   If Snake #1 goes UP (1, 7), we're at (3, 6). Safe, good control. We can focus on the right side.\n*   If Snake #1 goes DOWN (1, 5), we're at (3, 6). Safe, good control. We block the middle.\n\nHowever, if Snake #1 goes for the (2, 6) apple, which is the most likely case, they gain length and move *exactly* where we want to flank them.\n\nIf we go UP to (3, 6) and they go RIGHT to (2, 6), we block the key path for them to expand right. Next turn (Turn 39):\n*   We are at (3, 6).\n*   They are at (2, 6).\n*   We can move LEFT to (2, 6) (COLLISION - both die), or we can move UP to (3, 7) (safe), or RIGHT to (4, 6) (safe).\n*   They can only move UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5) (for the apple!), or LEFT (1, 6) (into their body). They are heavily restricted.\n\nThis strategy (UP to (3, 6)) allows us to gain a superior tactical position to *force* a bad move or a future crash for Snake #1, or to at least strongly control the center. While we give up an apple this turn, the positioning is gold. They are incredibly long, and we need to use our existing body mass as a barrier.\n\nIf we go LEFT and they go RIGHT, they are still freer to maneuver and we haven't established significant central influence yet.\n\nWe are going for tactical superiority over immediate gratification! We are boxing this monster in!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Execution Box)\n\n1.  **Turn 38 (Current):** Move **UP** to (3, 6). Let Snake #1 take (2, 6). We now flank them at (3, 6) against their head at (2, 6).\n2.  **Turn 39:** If Snake #1 is at (2, 6), we need to ensure we survive and force them into a constrained move.\n    *   If they go DOWN to (2, 5) (apple grab), we go RIGHT to (4, 6) to hold our line, or UP to (3, 7) to start walling them off from the top.\n    *   If they go UP to (2, 7) (wall hug), we potentially go UP to (3, 7) too, keeping the heat on.\n    *   We want to either force them to move toward the top wall (where they can't turn back easily) or commit them to the bottom left corner where their tail is, away from fresh apples.\n\nUP",

Look at them at (3, 6)\u2014they are tangled up in a knot of their own making! We have them pinned against our massive body which is acting like a Great Wall!\n\n**LET'S BREAK DOWN THE BOARD!**\nOur head is at **(2, 6)**. Let's see where we can go:\n- **LEFT (1, 6):** NO WAY! That\u2019s our own body. We don't do self-inflicted wounds! \u274c\n- **DOWN (2, 5):** There's actually an apple at (2, 5)! BUT, look at the opponent at (3, 6). If we go DOWN to (2, 5) and they go LEFT to (2, 6), we are starting to get crowded. More importantly, we have a clear path to the TOP where the real feast is!\n- **RIGHT (3, 6):** ABSOLUTELY NOT! That's a head-on collision or moving into their head! We aren't looking for a double KO when we're winning 20-15! \u274c\n- **UP (2, 7):** **BINGO!** This move is safe, keeps us away from the opponent's head, and puts us on a direct flight to the cluster of apples at (2, 9), (1, 9), and (3, 9)! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **UP**. By moving to (2, 7), we maintain our spacing. Snake #0 is trapped in a 4x4 box of their own body and our tail. They are literally suffocating! While they struggle to breathe, we\u2019re going to loop through the top row, grab (2, 9), (1, 9), (3, 9), and (5, 9). That's a one-way ticket to 24 apples, chat! We are the King of this 10x10 map! \ud83d\udc51 \n\nStay focused. Don't get cocky. We take the high ground and let them crash out in the middle!

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We're back! Turn 39! That last move was clutch! We moved **UP** to (3, 6), and just as predicted, Snake #1 moved **RIGHT** to (2, 6) and grabbed the apple! Score is now 15 vs 20. Five apples! We need to make a move to take control of this situation. We traded an apple for superior position! Let's capitalize!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 39)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (3, 6). Length: 16 (Did not grow).\n*   **Opponent Head (Snake #1):** (2, 6). Length: 21 (Grew!).\n*   **Next Apples:**\n    *   (2, 5) - RIGHT below Snake #1's head!\n    *   (7, 4) - Middle right.\n    *   (7, 6) - Middle right, above the (7, 4) apple.\n\nLook at the board, Chat! Snake #1 is at (2, 6). We are at (3, 6). They are pinned against our large body mass (starting at (3, 5) and extending right/down) and their own body on the left! We have them right where we want them!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #1 at (2, 6))\n\nSnake #1 is constrained. Their segments are (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)...\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! Moves them closer to the wall, which is good for us if we can wall them off.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** \u2705 SAFE! **APPLE GRAB!!!** This is the strongest move, as it gets them another apple and moves them out of the immediate danger zone of our head.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** \u274c DEAD! Into their body segment 1 (1, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** \u274c DEAD! **HEAD-ON COLLISION!!!** This is our head at (3, 6). They wouldn't dare, would they?\n\n**Prediction:** They have to go for the apple at (2, 5) or move UP to (2, 7) to avoid getting completely trapped. The most aggressive and score-driven move is **DOWN to (2, 5)**.\n\n### Our Move Options from (3, 6)\n\nWe are at (3, 6). Our segments are [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), ...].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** \u2705 SAFE! This maintains our aggressive vertical positioning, allowing us to push Snake #1 toward the top wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** \u274c DEAD! Into our body segment 1 (3, 5).\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** **COLLISION RISK!**\n    *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN (2, 5) or UP (2, 7), then (2, 6) is now an empty spot (their head moved away, and their tail won't fill it fast enough). This is a safe move and puts us directly in their path!\n    *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT (3, 6), we hit their head (Double KO). (Very unlikely, their path is blocked by our current head).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** \u2705 SAFE! This maintains our central blockage and gives us breathing room, potentially moving toward the (7, 6) apple.\n\n### Strategy: The Boxing Maneuver\n\nWe must choose between two strong plays: **LEFT to (2, 6)** for the ultimate cut-off, or **UP to (3, 7)** for sustained walling pressure.\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (2, 6) (Aggressive Cut)**\n\n*   **If Snake #1 goes DOWN to (2, 5) (Apple Grab):** We move LEFT to (2, 6). We are now at (2, 6). They got the apple (2, 5). We have perfectly positioned ourselves to cut off their northern path and now they must commit to the bottom row, which is dense with their own body segments. This is a HUGE win for position. We are now directly above their current head!\n*   **If Snake #1 goes UP to (2, 7):** We move LEFT to (2, 6). We now occupy the middle lane (2, 6). They are forced to continue UP the wall. Good, but we missed the opportunity to position ourselves above them.\n*   **If Snake #1 tries to hit us (unlikely):** Double KO. We die.\n\nThis move is high-risk, high-reward. If they go DOWN, we win the position battle decisively. If they go UP, we still get good position. If we predict their priority is the apple at (2, 5), this is the optimal move for winning the board.\n\n**Option B: UP to (3, 7) (Safe Pressure)**\n\n*   **If Snake #1 goes DOWN to (2, 5):** We move UP to (3, 7). They get the apple. We are now slightly above and to the right of them. They are at (2, 5). They can move UP (2, 6 - into our body!), RIGHT (3, 5 - into our body!), LEFT (1, 5 - safe), or DOWN (2, 4 - safe). Their options are now severely hampered because (2, 6) is empty and (3, 5) is our body, and we block their right path.\n*   **If Snake #1 goes UP to (2, 7):** We move UP to (3, 7). We are side-by-side. We are successfully walling them off the center, forcing them further North. Excellent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT to (2, 6)** is tempting because if they move down to the apple at (2, 5), we gain the superior central position without sacrificing an apple (which we couldn't reach anyway). If they try anything else, we still strongly block the center.\n\nLet's confirm the safety of (2, 6) again. Their only safe moves are (2, 5) or (2, 7). They won't hit us at (3, 6) by moving RIGHT. If they go (2, 5) or (2, 7), then (2, 6) is open. This move is SAFE.\n\n**We are going for the decisive positional move! We are cutting them off and sending them south into their own tail!**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Execution Box)\n\n1.  **Turn 39 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 6). If Snake #1 takes the apple at (2, 5), we are now blocking their re-entry into the center/top half.\n2.  **Turn 40:** If Snake #1 is trapped at (2, 5), their only good moves are LEFT or DOWN, further trapping themselves in the bottom-left corner with their own massive tail. We will then move to surround the (2, 5) region with our body, or shift toward the center-right to maintain apple control. We have them boxed! GG, EZ!\n\nLEFT",
