Moving up (0, 6) would allow me to eat the apple at (6, 3) if I move diagonally, but it's risky because I might collide with snake #2. Moving down (0, 8) would allow me to eat the apple at (9, 8), but it's also risky because I might collide with snake #2.\n\nMoving left (0, 6) would allow me to eat the apple at (9, 2), but it's risky because I might collide with snake #2.
