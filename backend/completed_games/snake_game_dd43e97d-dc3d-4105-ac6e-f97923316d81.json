It is fairly far from me and does not pose an immediate threat.\n4. **Goal**: Eat apples to gain points. Since there are multiple apples, my priority is to head toward the **closest available apple** to maximize efficiency. I must also avoid dangers such as walls and other snakes.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo decide on my move, I\u2019ll compute the Manhattan distance (sum of the differences in X and Y coordinates) to each apple from my current position (1, 3):\n- To (8, 8): |8 - 1| + |8 - 3| = 7 + 5 = 12\n- To (4, 8): |4 - 1| + |8 - 3| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- To (6, 2): |6 - 1| + |2 - 3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (0, 0): |0 - 1| + |0 - 3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- To (7, 2): |7 - 1| + |2 - 3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at **(0, 0)** with a distance of 4.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\nGiven that my target is (0, 0):\n1. From (1, 3), I need to move **left** (to decrease X) and **down** (to decrease Y) toward (0, 0).\n2. I\u2019ll initially prioritize moving **LEFT**, as this aligns me closer to the apple horizontally. This allows me to approach the vertical part of the movement afterward without overshooting.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\nFor future turns, if multiple apples are close, I will reevaluate distances dynamically based on new positions of myself, enemy snakes, and any apples consumed or removed. My goal is to continuously optimize my path toward the nearest available apple.\n\n---\n\n### Decided Move:\n**LEFT**"

I would need to move UP again to adjust back toward the apple.\n  - Although valid, the horizontal path is slightly less efficient than the direct vertical route.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Future Turns:\n- After moving UP, I should prepare to move RIGHT to collect the apple at **(2, 4)**.\n- If circumstances change (e.g., an immediate threat from an enemy snake), I need to reassess my priorities. However, right now, the enemy snake is distant and poses no risk.\n- Once I collect the apple, my next priority will likely shift toward the apples at **(6, 2)** and **(7, 2)**, as they appear to be the next closest targets.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**Move UP to (1, 3).**"

I am 3 segments long.\n   - The move I made before this turn was UP, bringing me to this position. So, my new body alignment is formed by following the tail removal process: the former head [(1, 2)] gets incorporated into the body as the tail segments move forward.\n\n2. **Apple Analysis**:\n   - Apples and their distances from my **current position (1, 3)**:\n     - **(8, 8)**: |8 - 1| + |8 - 3| = 7 + 5 = 12.\n     - **(6, 2)**: |6 - 1| + |2 - 3| = 5 + 1 = **6**.\n     - **(7, 2)**: |7 - 1| + |2 - 3| = 6 + 1 = **7**.\n     - **(2, 4)**: |2 - 1| + |4 - 3| = 1 + 1 = **2** (closest apple).\n     - **(5, 4)**: |5 - 1| + |4 - 3| = 4 + 1 = **5**.\n\n   - **Conclusion**: The apple at **(2, 4)** remains the closest and most efficient target. My strategy is still to move toward this apple.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Possible Moves**:\n   - My next move should continue progressing toward **(2, 4)** while avoiding obstacles.\n\n   #### Move Analysis:\n   **UP** (to (1, 4)):\n   - This move brings me closer to the apple at **(2, 4)**.\n   - Distance after this move: |2 - 1| + |4 - 4| = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n   - This sets me up perfectly to collect the apple in the next turn by moving RIGHT.\n   - There are no obstacles (walls, body segments, or enemy threats) in this direction.\n\n   **DOWN** (to (1, 2)):\n   - This move would result in me colliding with my body segment at **(1, 2)**. This is invalid.\n\n   **LEFT** (to (0, 3)):\n   - Moving LEFT would take me farther from the apple at **(2, 4)**:\n     - Distance after this move: |2 - 0| + |4 - 3| = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n   - This is unnecessary and inefficient. While this move is technically safe, it does not serve my objective.\n\n   **RIGHT** (to (2, 3)):\n   - Moving RIGHT advances me toward **(2, 4)** as well:\n     - Distance after this move: |2 - 2| + |4 - 3| = 0 + 1 = **1**.\n   - However, moving RIGHT introduces potential issues:\n     - The next turn would require an adjustment UP to avoid bypassing the apple at (2, 4).\n     - This creates a less direct and overcomplicated path as compared to a straightforward UP move.\n\n#### Strategic Comparison: \n- **UP** to (1, 4):\n  - Perhaps the most logical choice. This move positions me directly vertical to the apple, allowing me to collect it next turn with a single RIGHT move.\n  - The move avoids any inefficient detours or unnecessary directional changes.\n  - It guarantees no collisions or risks.\n  \n- **RIGHT** to (2, 3):\n  - A viable backup, but less effective than the UP move. This forces me into horizontal movement that requires a later correction (UP) before reaching the apple.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Future Turns:\n- After moving UP to **(1, 4)**:\n  - My next move would almost certainly be to go RIGHT to collect the apple at **(2, 4)**.\n  - Once the apple is collected, I grow and gain 1 point, extending my body. I'll then reassess the board and determine my next target. \n  - Current thoughts predict my next target might shift toward the apples at **(6, 2)** and **(7, 2)**. These appear to be the second-closest cluster.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**Move UP to (1, 4).**"
