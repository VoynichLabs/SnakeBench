Snake 0's head is at (1, 7) and its body is at (1, 8).\nApples are at (2, 4), (8, 1), (5, 5), (1, 5), (5, 7).\n\nI'm quite far above snake 0 and have space to move upwards. The board edges are a potential hazard, but not immediately in the way. The apple at (8, 1) is quite far away. It does not seem sensible to head towards it. The remaining apples at (2,4), (5,5), (1,5) are also not that close now.\nGiven the position of Snake 0, moving up allows me to create more space between us, reducing the chance of collision. If I go even further up, I could possibly reach the top edge of the board next turn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to move UP.\n\nUP",
