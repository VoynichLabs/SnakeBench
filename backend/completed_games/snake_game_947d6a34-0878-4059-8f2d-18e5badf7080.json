UP would move away from the apples as well.\n- Therefore, DOWN is the safest and most efficient choice to reach apples soon, while keeping future options open.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- After moving DOWN to (7,4), continue descending toward (7,2) to eat that apple first (then (7,1) if safe).

After securing an apple, assess new space and continue toward other apples if safe; avoid corners and maintain options to back off if the enemy closes in.\n\nPlan: Move toward the right edge to pursue the east-side apples; stay along open cells and avoid turning into your own body\u2019s neck.\n\nRIGHT",

Although it puts us on the bottom edge (fewer immediate escape squares), the apple reward and the low risk of contest make it worthwhile.\n- UP or RIGHT keep more room but forgo an easy apple; delaying gives the enemy more time to move toward column 8.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (8,0) now. After eating, move LEFT/UP as needed to avoid being trapped on the bottom edge and to head toward the other apples (prioritize (6,9) or the less-contested top apples) while keeping escape options open.\n\nDecision: take the safe immediate apple at (8,0).\n\nDOWN",

The closest reachable apple from my current position is at (4,3); moving LEFT now brings me toward that apple path (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) in a couple of turns.\n- The cells UP (7,4) and DOWN (7,2) are both clear of bodies on the board and do not immediately threaten apples, but they don\u2019t position me toward the nearest apple as efficiently as moving LEFT.\n- Enemies: Snake #0 is at (6,0) with a body that occupies lower rows. There\u2019s no immediate head-on risk this turn if I go LEFT.\n- Safety first: avoid self-collision and off-board moves; LEFT is safe, and keeps multiple future options open (toward the nearby apple and toward upper-left apples later).\n\nShort-term decision: prioritize approaching the nearest apple while maintaining safe movement options. LEFT best balances safety and future apple access right now; UP and DOWN are safe but less goal-directed this turn. RIGHT is fatal.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\nLEFT",

It also doesn\u2019t prevent the opponent from taking (4,3) next turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP now to keep options open and head north.
