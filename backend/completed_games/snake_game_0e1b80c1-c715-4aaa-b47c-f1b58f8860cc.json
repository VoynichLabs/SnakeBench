          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state and plan a move step by step.\n\n### Current Snake Position and Board:\n- **Your snake**: Head at (4,7), no body segments yet (just the head).\n- **Enemy snake**: Head at (1,0), no body segments.\n- **Apples**: (3,0), (2,1), (7,6), (2,3), (7,7).\n\n### Safe Moves:\nSince your snake has no body segments yet, you can move freely without risking hitting yourself. The only immediate risks are:\n1. Moving into an enemy snake's body (but the enemy has no body yet, so no risk here).\n2. Moving into an apple (safe, as it will grow you).\n3. Moving outside the board (0 \u2264 x \u2264 9, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 9).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: (4,8) - Valid, no apple, no risk.\n2. **DOWN**: (4,6) - Valid, no apple, no risk.\n3. **LEFT**: (3,7) - Valid, no apple, no risk.\n4. **RIGHT**: (5,7) - Valid, no apple, no risk.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Eating Apples**: The closest apples are at (3,0), (2,1), (7,6), (2,3), and (7,7). The shortest distance from (4,7) to these is:\n  - (3,0): Distance = sqrt((4-3)^2 + (7-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 49) = ~7.07 (not optimal).\n  - (2,1): Distance = sqrt((4-2)^2 + (7-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 36) = ~6.83.\n  - (7,6): Distance = sqrt((4-7)^2 + (7-6)^2) = sqrt(9 + 1) = ~3.16 (closest).\n  - (2,3): Distance = sqrt((4-2)^2 + (7-3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 16) = ~4.47.\n  - (7,7): Distance = sqrt((4-7)^2 + (7-7)^2) = sqrt(9 + 0) = 3 (closest).\n\nThe closest apples are (7,6) and (7,7). Since (7,7) is directly below (7,6), but your head is at (4,7), moving to (7,7) is a straight line down-right, which is a safe and direct path to an apple.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\nThe enemy snake is at (1,0). It will move this turn, but since it has no body, it can move anywhere without risk. However, it is currently at the bottom-left corner, so it might try to corner you or block your path. But since your snake is just a head, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Short-term**: Move to (7,7) to eat the apple there, which is closest and safe.\n- **Mid-term**: After eating, the snake will grow, and you'll need to avoid collisions with the enemy or your own body. Watch for the enemy's movement and plan accordingly.\n\n### Final Move:\n**DOWN** is not correct because (4,6) is not an apple. The correct move to eat the closest apple is **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT**",

No (apple is at (3, 0), not (2, 0)).\n   - Future options: Good (can go left, right, or up from there).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The closest apple is at (3, 0), which is to the right of my head.

It can move freely, but since your snake is just a head, it poses no immediate threat. However, it may try to corner you in future turns.\n\n5. **Optimal Single-Move:**\n   - Among the safe moves, **DOWN** to **(4,6)** is the most balanced:\n     - Keeps you in a position to reach **(7,6)** or **(7,7)** in the next few turns.\n     - Avoids unnecessary long-term risks (e.g., moving directly toward an apple that may be blocked by enemy movement).\n     - Maintains flexibility for future apple collection.\n\n6. **Long-Term Plan:**\n   - **Turn 2:** Move **RIGHT** to **(5,7)** to create a body segment and block enemy access to **(4,6)**.\n   - **Turn 3:** Move **DOWN** to **(5,6)** to extend toward **(7,6)**.\n   - **Turn 4:** Move **RIGHT** to **(7,6)** to eat the apple.\n   - **Turn 5:** Move **DOWN** to **(7,7)** to eat the next apple.\n\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",
