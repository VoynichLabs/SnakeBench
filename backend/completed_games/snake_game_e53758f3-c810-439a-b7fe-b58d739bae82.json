If we move RIGHT, we go from (1,8) to (2,8) and then we\u2019d be one move away (DOWN) to eat the apple; if we move DOWN, we move to (1,7) and then RIGHT to the apple. Both options are safe.\n\n\u2022 The enemy snake (#1) at (6,9) is far away and isn\u2019t a threat now, and none of our options would run into walls or our own body.\n\nFor this turn, moving RIGHT from (1,8) gets us closer to the apple at (2,7).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
