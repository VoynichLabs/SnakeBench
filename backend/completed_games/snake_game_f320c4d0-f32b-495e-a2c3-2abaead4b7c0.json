VALID.\n\nI have three valid options (DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT). I need to consider which gives me better access to apples while maintaining safety.\n\nThe closest apples are:\n- (5, 3) - accessible by going down and right\n- (8, 3) - accessible by going down and right\n- (5, 1) - accessible by going down and right\n- (7, 5) - accessible by going right and down\n\nThe enemy snake is far to the upper right, so there's no immediate risk from it.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 7) seems most advantageous because:\n1. It begins moving me toward the cluster of apples in the center/right side of the board\n2. It gives me more open space to maneuver\n3. Moving RIGHT starts me on a direct path toward the apple at (7, 5), which I can reach by continuing right and then down\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving right, I'll likely continue moving right and then start moving down to approach the apples at (7, 5), then potentially (5, 3) and (8, 3). I'll maintain awareness of both the enemy snake's movements and my own body position to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT"
