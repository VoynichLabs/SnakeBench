This suggests the snake is moving or recently moved in a direction consistent with the body position, probably LEFT or UP, since the body is at (5,6), which is to the right of (4,6).\n\nNow, considering the apples: the available apples are at (8,0), (0,8), (6,0), (2,2), and (2,5). From the current head position (4,6), let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (8,0): |4-8| + |6-0| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (0,8): |4-0| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8\n- To (2,2): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, the board has no immediate obstacles: the body at (5,6) occupies that cell, so movement cannot be in the opposite direction if it conflicts, but since we're considering moves from (4,6), moving RIGHT would be into the body, which is invalid. Other snakes, like enemy at (7,8), are not a threat currently.\n\nAvailable moves: LEFT to (3,6), UP to (4,5), or DOWN to (4,7). Avoiding DOWN is wise because increasing y (going down) increases the distance to (2,5), as |y difference| increases.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n- Moving LEFT to (3,6) reduces the x-difference to the apple by 1, with a new distance of |3-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 for (2,5).\n- Moving UP to (4,5) reduces the y-difference by 1 (since y decreases up), with a new distance of |4-2| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance to the apple by 1, but moving LEFT is more direct in reducing the primary vector (x-coordinate) toward (2,5). The rationale from the last move suggested moving left, and it aligns with the current apple target, even though there might have been a miscommunication with (2,6) in the apple reference ( (2,6) is not an apple, so the focus should be on (2,5)).\n\nThus, for the next move, choosing LEFT is efficient and reduces the distance. After moving to (3,6), we can reassess and continue toward (2,5), either directly or via another move, while watching for any changes in the board state.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move left to (3,6) to position for the next segment of the path toward (2,5). Then, after reaching (3,6), evaluate the next step based on the board, including checking if (3,6) is clear and if the path to (2,5) is safe. Potential threats: enemy snake at (7,8) is far, but monitor the board for new obstacles.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT",

This suggests the snake is moving or recently moved in a direction consistent with the body position, probably LEFT or UP, since the body is at (5,6), which is to the right of (4,6).\n\nNow, considering the apples: the available apples are at (8,0), (0,8), (6,0), (2,2), and (2,5). From the current head position (4,6), let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (8,0): |4-8| + |6-0| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (0,8): |4-0| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8\n- To (2,2): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, the board has no immediate obstacles: the body at (5,6) occupies that cell, so movement cannot be in the opposite direction if it conflicts, but since we're considering moves from (4,6), moving RIGHT would be into the body, which is invalid. Other snakes, like enemy at (7,8), are not a threat currently.\n\nAvailable moves: LEFT to (3,6), UP to (4,5), or DOWN to (4,7). Avoiding DOWN is wise because increasing y (going down) increases the distance to (2,5), as |y difference| increases.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n- Moving LEFT to (3,6) reduces the x-difference to the apple by 1, with a new distance of |3-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 for (2,5).\n- Moving UP to (4,5) reduces the y-difference by 1 (since y decreases up), with a new distance of |4-2| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance to the apple by 1, but moving LEFT is more direct in reducing the primary vector (x-coordinate) toward (2,5). The rationale from the last move suggested moving left, and it aligns with the current apple target, even though there might have been a miscommunication with (2,6) in the apple reference ( (2,6) is not an apple, so the focus should be on (2,5)).\n\nThus, for the next move, choosing LEFT is efficient and reduces the distance. After moving to (3,6), we can reassess and continue toward (2,5), either directly or via another move, while watching for any changes in the board state.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move left to (3,6) to position for the next segment of the path toward (2,5). Then, after reaching (3,6), evaluate the next step based on the board, including checking if (3,6) is clear and if the path to (2,5) is safe.

This suggests the snake is moving or recently moved in a direction consistent with the body position, probably LEFT or UP, since the body is at (5,6), which is to the right of (4,6).\n\nNow, considering the apples: the available apples are at (8,0), (0,8), (6,0), (2,2), and (2,5). From the current head position (4,6), let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (8,0): |4-8| + |6-0| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (0,8): |4-0| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8\n- To (2,2): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, the board has no immediate obstacles: the body at (5,6) occupies that cell, so movement cannot be in the opposite direction if it conflicts, but since we're considering moves from (4,6), moving RIGHT would be into the body, which is invalid. Other snakes, like enemy at (7,8), are not a threat currently.\n\nAvailable moves: LEFT to (3,6), UP to (4,5), or DOWN to (4,7). Avoiding DOWN is wise because increasing y (going down) increases the distance to (2,5), as |y difference| increases.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n- Moving LEFT to (3,6) reduces the x-difference to the apple by 1, with a new distance of |3-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 for (2,5).\n- Moving UP to (4,5) reduces the y-difference by 1 (since y decreases up), with a new distance of |4-2| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance to the apple by 1, but moving LEFT is more direct in reducing the primary vector (x-coordinate) toward (2,5). The rationale from the last move suggested moving left, and it aligns with the current apple target, even though there might have been a miscommunication with (2,6) in the apple reference ( (2,6) is not an apple, so the focus should be on (2,5)).\n\nThus, for the next move, choosing LEFT is efficient and reduces the distance. After moving to (3,6), we can reassess and continue toward (2,5), either directly or via another move, while watching for any changes in the board state.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move left to (3,6) to position for the next segment of the path toward (2,5). Then, after reaching (3,6), evaluate the next step based on the board, including checking if (3,6) is clear and if the path to (2,5) is safe.

Available moves are west, north, or south, with east blocked by the body. The nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Moving west to (3,6) would reduce the distance to 2, and moving south to (4,5) would also reduce the distance to 2. Moving north to (4,7) increases the distance to 4, which is unfavorable.\n\nNow, considering the board state, the snake at (4,6) is free. (4,5) and (3,6) are both empty based on the most recent board information. There are no immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or oneself. The apple (2,5) is closer in the y-direction (difference of 1), so reducing y first may be efficient.\n\nSince moving south to (4,5) aligns with (2,5)'s y-coordinate, it minimizes the y-difference to 0 and decreases the overall distance. From there, the snake can continue moving west to reach (2,5). This approach reduces the Manhattan distance more effectively and keeps the path straightforward. No obstacles are apparent, and this move shortens the steps to reach the apple.\n\nAvoid moving north, as it increases distance and may lead to less efficient positioning. West is an alternative that also shortens distance, but south directly addresses the smaller y-difference.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move south to (4,5) to reduce the y-coordinate towards the apple's position, then continue westward as necessary to reach (2,5). Monitor the board for any changes, such as apple consumption or new threats, and adjust moves accordingly.\n\n**Next move: SOUTH**\n\nThis is a random move: LEFT",

This suggests the snake is moving or recently moved in a direction consistent with the body position, probably LEFT or UP, since the body is at (5,6), which is to the right of (4,6).\n\nNow, considering the apples: the available apples are at (8,0), (0,8), (6,0), (2,2), and (2,5). From the current head position (4,6), let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\n- To (8,0): |4-8| + |6-0| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (0,8): |4-0| + |6-8| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- To (6,0): |4-6| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8\n- To (2,2): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (2,5): |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nThe nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3.\n\nNow, the board has no immediate obstacles: the body at (5,6) occupies that cell, so movement cannot be in the opposite direction if it conflicts, but since we're considering moves from (4,6), moving RIGHT would be into the body, which is invalid. Other snakes, like enemy at (7,8), are not a threat currently.\n\nAvailable moves: LEFT to (3,6), UP to (4,5), or DOWN to (4,7). Avoiding DOWN is wise because increasing y (going down) increases the distance to (2,5), as |y difference| increases.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP:\n- Moving LEFT to (3,6) reduces the x-difference to the apple by 1, with a new distance of |3-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 for (2,5).\n- Moving UP to (4,5) reduces the y-difference by 1 (since y decreases up), with a new distance of |4-2| + |5-5| = 2 + 0 = 2.\nBoth moves reduce the Manhattan distance to the apple by 1, but moving LEFT is more direct in reducing the primary vector (x-coordinate) toward (2,5). The rationale from the last move suggested moving left, and it aligns with the current apple target, even though there might have been a miscommunication with (2,6) in the apple reference ( (2,6) is not an apple, so the focus should be on (2,5)).\n\nThus, for the next move, choosing LEFT is efficient and reduces the distance. After moving to (3,6), we can reassess and continue toward (2,5), either directly or via another move, while watching for any changes in the board state.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move left to (3,6) to position for the next segment of the path toward (2,5). Then, after reaching (3,6), evaluate the next step based on the board, including checking if (3,6) is clear and if the path to (2,5) is safe. Potential threats: enemy snake at (7,8) is far, but monitor the board for new obstacles.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT",

I need to completely avoid collisions. My immediate priority is to not hit anything. Moving left again is likely to lead to another wall collision. \n\nLet's assess the apples. The closest apple is at (8, 0), but that's blocked by the wall. The apple at (0, 8) requires going up, and my current y-coordinate is 8, so going up is a viable option. Moving up would also give me some distance from the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move upwards, away from the wall and towards an apple.\n\nUP",

            "rationale": "First, let's review the current situation. The snake (ID 0) is at position (4,6) with a body segment at (5,6). Available moves are west, north, or south, with east blocked by the body. The nearest apple is at (2,5) with a Manhattan distance of 3. Moving west to (3,6) would reduce the distance to 2, and moving south to (4,5) would also reduce the distance to 2. Moving north to (4,7) increases the distance to 4, which is unfavorable.\n\nNow, considering the board state, the snake at (4,6) is free. (4,5) and (3,6) are both empty based on the most recent board information. There are no immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or oneself. The apple (2,5) is closer in the y-direction (difference of 1), so reducing y first may be efficient.\n\nSince moving south to (4,5) aligns with (2,5)'s y-coordinate, it minimizes the y-difference to 0 and decreases the overall distance. From there, the snake can continue moving west to reach (2,5). This approach reduces the Manhattan distance more effectively and keeps the path straightforward. No obstacles are apparent, and this move shortens the steps to reach the apple.\n\nAvoid moving north, as it increases distance and may lead to less efficient positioning. West is an alternative that also shortens distance, but south directly addresses the smaller y-difference.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Move south to (4,5) to reduce the y-coordinate towards the apple's position, then continue westward as necessary to reach (2,5). Monitor the board for any changes, such as apple consumption or new threats, and adjust moves accordingly.\n\n**Next move: SOUTH**\n\nThis is a random move: LEFT",
