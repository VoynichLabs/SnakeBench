Remember, the last move was UP, from (7, 4) to (7, 5), so I need to double-check the position:\n\nCurrent info indicates the head is at (7, 5). The body is at (7, 4). That makes sense: moving UP from (7,4) to (7,5).\n\n- Check for immediate dangers:\n    - Moving UP again (from (7, 5) to (7, 6)) would land at (7, 6). But at (7, 6), the board shows no apple, but there's potential obstacles:\n\n        - The snake body occupies (7, 4) and (7, 5), so moving further UP to (7, 6) is safe because the body is at (7, 4) and (7, 5), so (7, 6) is free.\n\n        - Note the apples at:\n            - (4, 2), (3, 2), (5, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8).\n\n        - The apple at (7, 6) is directly above current head at (7, 5), so moving UP to (7, 6) would yield an apple, and cause the snake to grow.\n\n    - Moving RIGHT from (7, 5) to (8, 5): no apple there, and (8, 5) is free; potential future options.\n\n    - Moving LEFT from (7, 5) to (6, 5): no apple (since apples are at (4,2), (3,2), etc.), but still safe; potential for options.\n\n    - Moving DOWN from (7, 5) to (7, 4): currently occupied by the body (since last move was UP). Moving down would cause collision with itself.\n\n- Given all this, the move to (7, 6) is optimal because it directly leads to the apple at (7, 6). \n\n- Also, consider the apple at (7, 8), which is two steps above; moving up now gets us closer to it.\n\n- Checking the other apples:\n    - (4, 2) and (3, 2): far to the left and down.\n    - (5, 4): a few steps to the right and down.\n    - (7, 8): two steps above, in line.\n\n- The current goal should be to reach the closest apple efficiently, which is (7, 6). Moving UP to (7, 6) will cause us to eat that apple and grow, and then we can plan paths toward the other apples.\n\n- Is there any risk with moving UP to (7, 6)? The only other snake is at (7, 9), which is far above, so no danger there.\n\n- Moving in any other direction seems less optimal right now; specifically, LEFT and RIGHT are less direct towards the apple, and DOWN is invalid.\n\n**Next step: Move UP to (7, 6).**\n\n---\n\n**Decision: UP**",
