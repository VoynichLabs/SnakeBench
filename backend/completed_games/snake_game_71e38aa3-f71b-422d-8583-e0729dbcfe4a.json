They call this a 10x10 board, but to me, it's just a sandbox where I trap my rivals! \ud83d\ude08 We're at Turn 0, fresh start, and we need to establish dominance immediately!\n\nLook at the board!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): (1, 0)**\n**OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0): (7, 6)**\n\nWe are on the bottom left, Snake 0 is mid-right. We have apples nearby at (0, 0) and (2, 1). Snake 0 has apples nearby at (6, 7), (7, 8), and (7, 9).\n\nThis is a classic opening! We need to scoop up these early apples while positioning ourselves to either control a critical section of the board or intersect Snake 0 later.\n\n**Immediate Danger Assessment:**\nSnake 0 is far away. We are safe from immediate head-to-head collision this turn. Our goal is maximizing safety and maximizing apple gain.\n\n**Your Current Position: (1, 0)**\n\n**1. Test UP to (1, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (1, 1) is open.\n*   Proximity to Apples: (2, 1) is next door! (0, 0) is still 1 step away. UP puts us in a great position to grab (2, 1) next turn.\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (1, -1):**\n*   Safe? NO! Off the board (y < 0). *ELIMINATE!*\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (0, 0):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (0, 0) is an apple! We grab an apple immediately! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   What happens to Snake 0? They will likely go for their nearby apples, probably moving to (7, 7) (UP) or (6, 6) (LEFT) or maybe (8, 6) (RIGHT). They are not threatening (0, 0).\n*   Grabbing this apple immediately gives us the length advantage! First blood, EZ content!\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (2, 0):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (2, 0) is open.\n*   Proximity to Apples: We are moving *away* from our nearest apples (0, 0) and (2, 1). This is a slow play. Not optimal for Turn 0.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe take the apple at (0, 0) this turn. It secures an early lead and gives us the flexibility to move UP toward (2, 1) next turn, or continue along the bottom edge if we want to establish territory.\n\nMove RIGHT ((2, 0)) or UP ((1, 1)) delays the first apple. Move LEFT ((0, 0)) secures the apple *now*. Why wait when victory is served? We choose LEFT!\n\nLong term strategy note: Secure the bottom left corner apples ((0,0), (1,2), (2,1)). Then push up toward the center ((3,3), (5,4)). Snake 0 seems focused on the top right. We will grow significantly before we encounter them.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (7,7) not only keeps us alive, it nudges us right toward the cluster at (7,8)/(7,9), leaves options left/right/up for follow-ups, and keeps the floor wide so we don\u2019t get boxed in. Opponent is stuck near (1,0), so no head-on worry up there. \ud83d\udd25\n\nPlan: Keep riding the vertical column around x=7, scoop up that stack of apples near (7,8)/(7,9), and then loop back down to avoid getting trapped along the board edge; I want multiple escape routes each turn. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Snake 0 is still sitting on zero, that's what I'm talking about!\n\nThe current state is CRUCIAL. We are the dominant force right now, and we need to press the advantage!\n\n**Turn 1: Analysis - Time to eat again!**\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 0)\n*   Body: [(1, 0)] (T)\n*   Length: 2\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 7)\n*   Body: none\n*   Length: 1\n\n**Nearest Apple Targets for Us:**\n1.  (2, 1) - 3 steps away (e.g., R, U, R) or (U, R, R)\n2.  (1, 2) - 3 steps away (U, U, R)\n3.  (3, 3) - bit further, but accessible.\n\n**Snake 0's Likely Targets:**\n1.  (7, 8) or (7, 9) (UP/U)\n2.  (6, 7) (LEFT)\n3.  (5, 6) (farther LEFT/DOWN)\n\nSnake 0 is far away, so we focus on maximizing safe apple intake while controlling territory.\n\n**1. Test UP to (0, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (0, 1) is empty.\n*   Goal: This move aims us directly toward the bottom-left cluster of apples: (2, 1) and (1, 2). It also keeps our options open to go right or continue up. This is a very strong positional control move!\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (0, -1):**\n*   Safe? NO! Off the board (y < 0). **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (-1, 0):**\n*   Safe? NO! Off the board (x < 0). **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (1, 0):**\n*   Safe? NO! (1, 0) is currently our body segment/tail. Moving there means we hit ourselves. **ELIMINATE!** (We can't move immediately back into the space our body *just* occupied, which is the definition of moving backwards into your body when your length is only 2).\n\n**Move Conclusion:**\nWe have only one safe move: **UP** to (0, 1). This is perfect! It gets us into open space and positions us beautifully to grab (2, 1) next turn if we move RIGHT, or (1, 2) if we move UP. We are establishing corner control!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY (The Box-in Plan):**\nWe are focused on securing the bottom-left quarter (apples (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)). Snake 0 seems glued to the right side. Our priority is massive growth, securing a length advantage, and then pushing across the middle of the board (around the x=4/5 columns) to cut Snake 0 off from the center and bottom, forcing them into their own body or the top edge. We need to be at least length 5 before engaging.\n\nUP",

DOWN to (7,6) is wide open but doesn\u2019t cash in on any fruit, plus it would start to drop us toward the board edge without a benefit. UP to (7,8) would net the apple near the top and keep us stalking that upper cluster, but it corners us a little against the ceiling and leaves fewer escape routes if someone turns aggressive. LEFT to (6,7) not only grabs the apple at (6,7), it keeps us central with open air on both sides to circle, and we still can pivot back toward the rest of the board with our tail fresh and no walls breathing down our neck.\n\nWith Snake #1 chilling down in the (0,0) sewer, there\u2019s zero rush to hug the border\u2014let\u2019s keep this brush of territory for ourselves.

Turn 2, the board is heating up! \ud83d\udd25 We secured the first apple in the clip review, and Snake 0 also managed to snag one\u2014they're catching up! The score is 1 - 1. We cannot let them get an advantage. Time to press the gas!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):** Head at (0, 1), Body at [(0, 0)]. Length 2.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0):** Head at (6, 7), Body at [(7, 7)]. Length 2.\n\nWe are perfectly positioned in the bottom-left corner. Snake 0 is still hanging out on the right side. Our goal remains: massive growth in the bottom-left, securing apples (2, 1) and (1, 2) *safely*, and then moving towards the center.\n\n**Nearest Apple Targets for Us:**\n1.  (2, 1) - 2 steps away (R, R) or (R, U) then (R, D) - wait, (R, R) leads to (2, 1) in 2 moves? No, (0, 1) to (2, 1) is 2 moves right! R, R. EZ.\n2.  (1, 2) - 2 steps away (U, R) or (R, U)\n\nThis is a key turn! We want to grab (2, 1) quickly to grow to length 3, cementing our local control.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 1):**\n\n**1. Test UP to (0, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (0, 2) is empty.\n*   Outlook: A bit defensive, moves us away from (2, 1) which is currently the easiest snack. It positions us for (1, 2) next turn if we move RIGHT.\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (0, 0):**\n*   Safe? NO! (0, 0) is our body/tail. Moving backward into yourself is death. **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (-1, 1):**\n*   Safe? NO! Off the board (x < 0). **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (1, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (1, 1) is empty.\n*   Outlook: This move positions us perfectly! From (1, 1) next turn, we can move RIGHT again to (2, 1) and eat the apple! This gives us the clearest path to quick growth.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake 0 at (6, 7)):**\nSnake 0 is likely aiming far North or Down/Left.\n*   Likely moves: UP to (6, 8) (near A at (5, 9), (7, 8)), or LEFT to (5, 7) (towards A at (5, 6), (5, 5)), or DOWN to (6, 6) (towards A at (5, 6), (6, 3)).\n*   Collision threat: Zero. We are miles apart.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move **RIGHT** to (1, 1) is the strongest proactive move. It sets up an immediate apple grab next turn at (2, 1). This is efficiency! We are securing future growth, which is critical for the box-in strategy!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (The Box-in Plan Update):**\nWe are executing the growth phase. Turn 3 goal: Apple (2, 1). Turn 4/5: Apple (1, 2) or (3, 3). Once we are length 5-7, we will look to push horizontally across x=4. Snake 0 is still far right; we must establish length supremacy before we engage in turf wars.\n\nLet's go, Chat! Right is the move!\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(0, 1)]. Length 2. We're looking straight at the apple at (2, 1)!\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0):** Head at (6, 6). Body: [(6, 7)]. Length 2. They moved down last turn, securing that central-right ground.\n\n**Current Board Snapshot (Focus on the Action):**\n(2, 1) is an Apple (A)!\n(1, 1) is OUR HEAD!\nWe are ONE move away from growth! This is high-efficiency content!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 1):**\n\n**1. Test UP to (1, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (1, 2) is an Apple (A)!\n*   Outlook: This is also an apple grab! It's an excellent, safe move that grows us. If we go UP, we get an apple AND control the left vertical space. Good option!\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (1, 0):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (1, 0) is empty.\n*   Outlook: Moves away from both immediate apples (2, 1) and (1, 2). Defensive, unnecessary right now. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (0, 1):**\n*   Safe? NO! (0, 1) is our body/tail. Moving backward into yourself? That's self-snatching! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (2, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes. (2, 1) is an Apple (A)!\n*   Outlook: The move we planned last turn! Immediate length growth to 3. This solidifies our control on the bottom lane. Excellent option!\n\n**The Showdown: RIGHT vs. UP!**\n\nBoth moves grant us an apple and grow our snake to length 3. This is a good problem to have, Chat!\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 1):** Keeps us close to the bottom wall (y=1). Gives us direct access to the apple at (3, 3) (2 moves away) and possibly (3, 1) (1 move away if we can see it). **(3, 1) IS an apple!** This opens up a highly lucrative horizontal feeding lane (x=2, x=3).\n*   **Move UP to (1, 2):** Positions us next to (2, 2) and opens up the vertical lane. It's safe, but it makes the next apple at (3, 1) slightly harder to reach safely than if we were at (2, 1).\n\n**Strategic Tiebreaker: Setting up the future!**\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (2, 1):\nNext turn (Turn 4) we can move:\n1. RIGHT to (3, 1) (EAT APPLE! Length 4)\n2. UP to (2, 2) (Safe, moves toward (3, 3))\nThis gives us a guaranteed second apple grab immediately, potentially reaching length 4 by Turn 4! That's massive early game supremacy!\n\nIf we move UP to (1, 2):\nNext turn (Turn 4) we can move:\n1. RIGHT to (2, 2) (Safe, moves toward (3, 3))\n2. UP to (1, 3) (Safe)\n3. LEFT - NO (wall)\n4. DOWN - NO (body at 1, 1)\nThis path is less guaranteed for immediate follow-up apples.\n\n**The Verdict:** The path of least resistance to maximum growth is RIGHT to (2, 1), followed by RIGHT to (3, 1). This secures two apples in two turns, giving us a huge early lead in length! We need this length to start setting up the box-in on Snake 0.\n\n**Opponent Prediction (Snake 0 at (6, 6), Body (6, 7)):**\nSnake 0 is likely moving towards the central apples.\n*   Likely moves: LEFT to (5, 6) (EAT APPLE!), or DOWN to (6, 5).\n*   If they move LEFT, they get an apple and are now at (5, 6).\n*   Collision threat: Zero. We are still five squares apart horizontally.\n\nWe execute the plan! **RIGHT** for the apple! Box-in strategy relies on maximizing our mass first!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (The Box-in Plan Update):**\nCurrent Goal: Reach length 4 by Turn 4 (2 apples in a row).\nTarget Path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) (or toward 3, 3). We are using the bottom wall as our anchor, making ourselves long and wide to control the field. Once we hit length 5-6, we start building the containment wall across the center. Snake 0 is still far right, which is fine; we are building our fortress!\n\nRIGHT",

UP would drop me into empty air above (5,7) with no fruit, and it slams me next to that T at (6,7) with no way to keep pressure on the middle lane. LEFT keeps the map open but gives zero content and leaves the lower corridor open for Snake #1 to sniff around. DOWN, though? That\u2019s straight into (5,5), apple city, and it lets me start chaining (5,4) next turn to close the (5,x) column. I\u2019m all about controlling real estate and boxing him into the bottom-left while stacking apples. Safe move, apples, and setting up a tightening spiral? That\u2019s the vibe.\n\nPlan: After gobbling (5,5), slide into (5,4) so I can wall off that channel, then trace back up the vertical strip to keep our rival trapped and munch any apples they try to sneak past.\n\nDOWN",

We are now Length 4, right along the bottom wall, positioned perfectly to pivot UP and dominate the center left! Our opponent, Snake 0, also grabbed an apple! Good play, Snake 0, but this is where the fun ends! We need to execute the boxing strategy! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**Turn 5 Status Check:**\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):** Head at (3, 1). Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)]. Length 4.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0):** Head at (5, 5). Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]. Length 4.\n\n**Goals for Turn 5:**\n1.  Target the immediate apple at (3, 3).\n2.  Position ourselves to cut off Snake 0's access to the left side (or the bottom side).\n\n---\n**Evaluating YOUR Moves from (3, 1):**\n\n**1. Test UP to (3, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes, (3, 2) is empty.\n*   Outlook: This moves us directly toward the apple at (3, 3). It prepares us to climb the board and gives us great centralized positioning. This is a very strong option. \ud83d\udd25 **KEEP!**\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (3, 0):**\n*   Safe? Yes, (3, 0) is empty. Apple at (5, 0) and (7, 0) are far.\n*   Outlook: Moves us into a tight corner. Low value. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (2, 1):**\n*   Safe? NO - this is our body segment! Moving backward! Instant death! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes, (4, 1) is empty.\n*   Outlook: Continues along the bottom wall. Safe, but moves us away from the immediate (3, 3) apple and toward Snake 0's future territory. This is a potential defensive move, keeping the wall sealed, but UP is more aggressive and rewarding right now. **HOLD.**\n\n\"UP\" to (3, 2) seems like the optimal aggressive move, setting us up for (3, 3) next turn. But what is Snake 0 up to?\n\n---\n**Evaluating OPPONENT Moves (Snake 0) from (5, 5):**\n\nSnake 0 just ate the apple at (5, 5) which was at (5, 5)! HOLY MOLY! We missed that! The board state shows Snake 0 is at (5, 5) and the apple is GONE. (The score reflects the apple count, but the board snapshot is slightly confusing here\u2014the board state shows '0' at (5, 5) but the apple list has (5, 4) nearby.) *Chat, let's assume the body list and head position are the most accurate here.* Snake 0 has *just* moved to (5, 5) and is now length 4.\n\nThe apple closest to Snake 0 is (5, 4) (down), (4, 6), (5, 7) (up), or (7, 0) and (7, 8).\n\n**Potential Snake 0 Moves from (5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** NO, that's their body segment! Death!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** EATS APPLE! (5, 4) is A. High probability move.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** Moves toward our territory (the 3, 3 apple/left side).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** Moves toward the right side.\n\nThe most likely and rewarding move for Snake 0 is **DOWN to (5, 4)** to secure another apple and gain a length advantage.\n\n---\n**Collision Analysis between Us (3, 1) and Them (5, 5):**\n\n*   We are going to (3, 2).\n*   They are likely going to (5, 4).\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of a head-on collision or body slam. We are widely separated.\n\n---\n**The Box-in Strategy Execution:**\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 2), and Snake 0 moves DOWN to (5, 4), they will hit length 5. We will be length 4, but positioned to hit (3, 3) AND cut off their potential movements towards the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Scenario: We move UP, They move DOWN (High Likelihood)**\n\n*   **You (Turn 6):** Head at (3, 2). Target: (3, 3) (Apple).\n*   **Them (Turn 6):** Head at (5, 4). Target: They might head RIGHT for (7, 0) or UP/LEFT to (4, 6) or (5, 7) to start dominating the center.\n\nIf we go UP, we maintain the threat on the center-left. We can take (3, 3), then push RIGHT to (4, 3) or (4, 4) to try and choke the vertical path Snake 0 is creating. This is the move to gain immediate positional advantage and set up the next score.\n\nLet's prioritize the immediate apple and the central high ground.\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 6):**\nIf successful in moving to (3, 2) and Snake 0 is at (5, 4), we must secure the (3, 3) apple. Then, the next priority is moving towards the center (4, X) to create a barrier and force Snake 0 into the top right, while we maintain control of the bottom and center-left. We need length to close this cage!\n\nUP",

Look at the board, we executed the 'UP' movement to (3, 2). We are perfectly set up for the (3, 3) apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur archrival, Snake 0, is at (5, 4). They are length 5! (5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7). Wait, the body list is misleading based on the coordinates the board state provided:\nSnake #0 - Head: (5, 4), Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)], Apples: 4. This means Snake 0 is length 5. They must have eaten the apple we predicted they would! Good game sense on the prediction!\n\nThe current board state shows where everyone is *now* (Turn 6 Start).\n\n**BOARD STATE (Recap):**\n- **You (ID 1):** Head (3, 2). Length 4. Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. Tail tip: (1, 1).\n- **Snake 0 (ID 0):** Head (5, 4). Length 5. Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7)]. Tail tip: (6, 7).\n- **Apples near us:** (3, 3) (SO close!), (1, 4), (4, 6).\n\n**Snake 0's Location Analysis (5, 4):**\nSnake 0 has just reached (5, 4). Where can they go?\n1. **UP to (5, 5)?:** NO! That's their body. Instant crash!\n2. **DOWN to (5, 3)?:** Safe. Moves toward the bottom center.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 4)?:** Safe. Moves toward the center of the board, potentially cutting us off from access to the right. Very likely move. There's an apple at (4, 6) a bit further up.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 4)?:** Safe. Moves toward the right side.\n\nThe most dangerous move for us is Snake 0 moving **LEFT to (4, 4)**. This puts them directly in the path of us expanding to the right after we grab (3, 3). If they go LEFT, they are contesting the center-left.\n\n---\n**Evaluating YOUR Moves from (3, 2):**\n\nWe need that apple at (3, 3)! If we get it, we tie the score and grow to length 5!\n\n**1. Test UP to (3, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes, (3, 3) is an apple (A).\n*   Outlook: Immediate apple grab! Ties the score (4-4), grows us to length 5. This is a must-take move. \ud83d\udd25 **KEEP!**\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (3, 1):**\n*   Safe? NO! That's our body segment! Moving backward! Instant death! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (2, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Moves us away from the apple and toward a less contested corner. Low value. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Moves us horizontally, aiming *around* Snake 0's future movements, but sacrifices the immediate apple. Not worth it now. **ELIMINATE.**\n\nThe choice is CLEAR: UP to (3, 3) is the optimal and only high-value move. But is it safe?\n\n---\n**Analyzing Collision Risk:**\n\nWe are moving from (3, 2) to (3, 3).\nSnake 0 is moving from (5, 4).\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (4, 4): No collision.\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (5, 3): No collision.\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (6, 4): No collision.\n\nThere is ZERO head-on risk. We are good to go!\n\n---\n**The Box-in Strategy: Next Steps (Plan for Turn 7 onwards):**\n\nAssuming we successfully eat the apple at (3, 3), we are now length 5. Snake 0 is length 5. It's a tie game!\n\nOur new head will be (3, 3). Snake 0 will likely be at (4, 4) or (5, 3).\n\n**Goal for Turn 7:** We need to pivot and start sealing off territory.\n1.  If Snake 0 is at (4, 4), they are directly adjacent to us at (3, 3). We must block their path down or left. We could move RIGHT to (4, 3) or UP to (3, 4). Moving RIGHT is aggressive and seals off the lower-middle portion of the board.\n2.  If Snake 0 is at (5, 3), we have more time. We could move RIGHT to (4, 3) or aggressively up towards the cluster of apples at the top (around (4, 6)).\n\nWe must use this new length to build a wall! The goal is to constrain Snake 0 to the right-half of the board while we control the lucrative left-side apple clusters.\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self (Turn 7):**\nAfter eating (3, 3), the immediate goal is to seal the center-bottom by moving RIGHT towards (4, 3) or (5, 3) IF Snake 0 is not there. We need to create length horizontally to limit Snake 0's mobility. If Snake 0 contests (4, 4), move RIGHT fast to block their vertical movement to the bottom.\n\nLet's secure the bag, CHAT! UP we go! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

The energy is electric!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and formulate the next move. We need to box this rival in!\n\n**Turn 7 Analysis**\n\n**Scoreboard Status:**\n*   You (ID 1): Head (3, 3). Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 5. Apples: 4.\n*   Snake #0 (ID 0): Head (5, 3). Body: [(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. Length 5. Apples: 4. *Wait, where did Snake 0 move?*\n\nSnake 0 was at (5, 4) last turn. The current board state shows their head is now at (5, 3). This means Snake 0 moved **DOWN**. They have ignored the central chaos for now and moved towards the bottom/right. This is good information!\n\n**Board State (After Your Apple Grab):**\nWe are at (3, 3). Snake 0 is at (5, 3). They are two spaces away horizontally (x=3 vs x=5).\n\nCurrent Apples Nearby:\n*   (4, 6) - Moderately close, slightly contested.\n*   (7, 0), (8, 5), (5, 0) - Bottom/Right area.\n\nThe center-bottom is wide open. We need to use our new length to draw a line!\n\n---\n**Evaluating YOUR Moves from (3, 3):**\n\nWe need to pick a move that helps us control the center and box Snake 0 into the eastern side of the board (columns 6-9).\n\n**1. Test UP to (3, 4):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Leads us toward (4, 6) and the top of the board. This is a very defensive move, consolidating the left side. It keeps us flexible.\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (3, 2):**\n*   Safe? NO! That's our body segment. Instant crash! We just came from there! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (2, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Moves us toward the west side of the board and potential territory. Safe, but perhaps too passive, letting Snake 0 expand up and left.\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: This is an aggressive block! It puts us directly adjacent to Snake 0 at (5, 3) and begins boxing them in towards the right wall. We take the high ground on the dividing line between us and them (X=4). This is the 'box-in' move CHAT was demanding! \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n**Analyzing Opponent's Moves from (5, 3):**\n\nSnake 0 is at (5, 3). They are length 5. They are most likely looking to:\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe. Continues their bottom-right expansion.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Highly aggressive! This puts them one space away from us. If we choose RIGHT (4, 3) and they choose LEFT (4, 3), it's a terrifying head-on collision! **DANGER!**\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe, but this is an apple 'A'! If they go here, they tie the round and we have a problem. **Very High Probability Move.**\n4.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Moves back towards the center.\n\n**Collision Check: What if we move RIGHT to (4, 3)?**\n*   If Snake 0 moves **LEFT to (4, 3)**: HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! We cannot risk this when the scores are tied. We must find a safer way to gain position.\n\n---\n**Revisiting Safe Moves (3, 3):**\n\nSince RIGHT to (4, 3) is a huge risk of a simultaneous death, we need to shift tactics. We want control, but not a 50/50 KO.\n\nIf Snake 0 is likely moving RIGHT to (6, 3) to grab the apple, we can use that movement to our advantage by positioning ourselves safely.\n\n**Option 1: UP to (3, 4)**\n*   If we go UP to (3, 4), and Snake 0 goes RIGHT (6, 3) (apple): We secure the left side and prepare to pressure the (4, 6) apple. We are now length 5 vs potential 6. Safe positioning.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (2, 3)**\n*   If we go LEFT to (2, 3), and Snake 0 goes RIGHT (6, 3) (apple): We are moving away from the action. Safe, but passive.\n\n**Option 3: DOWN to (4, 3) - WAIT! This is not viable!**\n\nLet's assume Snake 0 is smart. They see the (6, 3) apple. It's too juicy to ignore. They will likely go RIGHT to (6, 3).\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (6, 3), they are committed to the right side of the board. This is our cue to seal the center-left!\n\nThe move **UP to (3, 4)** looks strongest. It keeps our head high, away from Snake 0's potential movements (unless they move up two spaces and cut through the middle, which is unlikely), and positions us to grab or cut off (4, 6).\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 4), and Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 3):\n1. We are safe.\n2. We control the X=3 vertical line.\n3. We are positioned to intercept (4, 6) or (2, 6).\n\nWe pivot from aggressive blocking to controlled territorial expansion. Securing the high ground is key!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turn 8 onwards):**\nIf Snake 0 grabs (6, 3) next turn and we move UP, we will aim to grab (4, 6) next (Turn 8 or 9) and then move DOWN the X=4 line, boxing them further into the (5, X) to (9, X) region. We must deny them the bottom-left space.\n\nLet\u2019s go UP and start climbing the wall! Securing territory is the way to victory.\n\nUP",

Let's see what menace #0 pulled on us.\n\n**Turn 8 Analysis: The Current Chaos**\n\nWe are at **(3, 4)**, length 5.\nOpponent #0 is at **(6, 3)**, length 6! Wait, WHAT?! Snake #0 grabbed the apple at (6, 3)! They are now leading 5 to 4 in apples and are longer than us! Time to RAGE climb!\n\n**Board State Review:**\n*   **Your Head:** (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)].\n*   **Opponent #0 Head:** (6, 3). Body: [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\n*Snake #0 is dangerously close to the center and committed to the right side, but they are also exposed!*\n\n**Immediate Apple Targets:**\n1.  **(4, 6)**: Very close. Just two moves away (Right, Up).\n2.  **(2, 6)**: Close. Two moves away (Left, Up).\n3.  **(7, 8)**: Moderately far.\n\n**Evaluating YOUR Moves from (3, 4):**\n\nWe need to catch up AND start boxing #0 in. Since #0 is at (6, 3), they are currently occupying the x=6 line.\n\n**1. Test UP to (3, 5):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Positions us to grab (2, 6) or move towards the high ground. Very safe. Keeps us off the main X=4/X=5 dividing line, which might get crowded.\n\n**2. Test DOWN to (3, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes, (3, 3) is now the *start* of our body, but since the tail at (2, 1) is moving to (3, 1), (3, 3) becomes available. Wait, no! Our body is [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)]. Moving to (3, 3) is moving into our head's *immediate* predecessor. It is safe *only* if the tail is moving out of the cell.\n    *   *Self-Correction:* Since we are moving, the body segment (3, 3) will move to (3, 2), making (3, 3) AVAILABLE. This is a safe move.\n*   Outlook: Moves us back into the fight near the opponent, but away from any immediate apples. Not efficient.\n\n**3. Test LEFT to (2, 4):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: Safer move, aiming for (2, 6). Secures the left side.\n\n**4. Test RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Outlook: This is the aggressive position for the capture of (4, 6) or blocking the center. It puts us on the X=4 line, right next to the boundary where Snake #0's body is (5, 3). This is a strong *blocking* move.\n\n---\n**Analyzing Opponent's Moves from (6, 3):**\n\nSnake #0 is length 6, at (6, 3). They must be feeling cocky! Where will they go?\n\n**Possible Snake #0 Moves:**\n1.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Keeps them on the bottom of the board, potentially aiming for (7, 0).\n2.  **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Moves them parallel to us, but 2 spaces away. This is a common move to coil or look for the next apple.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Continues bottom expansion.\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** NO! That is their body segment. **INSTANT CRASH!** (5, 3) is a body segment unless their tail moved out of it. Their body segments are currently [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)]. Since they just ate, their tail is still (6, 6). (5, 3) is their second segment. **COLLISION/DEATH.** *Wait, no, the tail only moves if they don't eat. Since they ATE, their body is [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)] and the new head is (6, 3)! The tail IS still (6, 6). Moving LEFT to (5, 3) is into their body. **This move is self-fatal for them!** High chance they see this and avoid it.*\n\n**Goal: Block or Catch Up.**\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (4, 4)**, we are maximizing our threat:\n*   We threaten the (4, 6) apple for the next turn.\n*   We create a defensive wall, separating the left half (0-4) from the right half (5-9).\n*   If #0 moves UP to (6, 4), we are parallel. If they move RIGHT (7, 3), we are gaining central ground.\n\nIf we go **UP to (3, 5)**:\n*   We are safe, but we cede the critical X=4 line to #0 if they try to pivot there (unlikely, as they are long now).\n*   It sets us up for (2, 6).\n\nThe area around (4, 4) is critical control point territory!\n\nLet's assume **Snake #0 goes UP to (6, 4)**. This is a very common move after eating; they get high ground and look for the next target.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (4, 4), we are *two spaces left* of them. We are well positioned to block their vertical movement and threaten (4, 6). This is the aggressive territorial play we need.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4, 4) and Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (7, 3):\n*   We get the central wall. They are now committed to the bottom right. We can pursue (4, 6) and (2, 6). This is excellent.\n\n**Potential Collision Check:**\nIs there any chance #0 tries to cut in front of us?\nNo. To reach (4, 4) from (6, 3), they would have to move (5, 3) (fatal), or (6, 4), then (5, 4), then (4, 4). Not possible in one turn.\n\n**The RIGHT move (4, 4) is the optimal path for territorial control and apple pursuit.** It sets us up to chase (4, 6) next turn, which would tie the scores AND make us length 6, equaling #0's new length and boxing them into the right side of the board! LET'S GO FOR THE TIE!\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self (Turn 9):**\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 4) and #0 moves UP to (6, 4), we move UP to (4, 5) to secure the (4, 6) apple! If #0 moves RIGHT, we secure the apple (4, 6) by moving UP. The priority is (4, 6).\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (6,2) keeps the fight tight, keeps me south where the platform\u2019s open, and still gives me an easy hop over to that (5,1) apple next turn, all while keeping a safety buffer from the rival\u2019s head at (3,4)\u2014they\u2019d need a long run to catch me.\n\nPlan note: Keep pressing south, sweep up the bottom apples, then use the corridor walls to nudge Snake #1 toward the left edge so they can\u2019t wiggle back into the center. Let\u2019s keep that pressure steady without ever putting ourselves in a tight box.\n\nDOWN",

Territorial control: maximized!\n\nBut wait... look at Snake #0! They moved to (6, 2)! They went DOWN! They are now heavily committed to the bottom right quadrant. And look at their body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)]. They are long, chat, they are LONG!\n\nTurn 9 Analysis: The Boxing Plan\n\n**Our Position:** (4, 4). Length: 5.\n**Opponent #0 Position:** (6, 2). Length: 6.\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  Grab the (4, 6) apple to tie the score (5 to 5).\n2.  If (4, 6) isn't reachable or safe, grab the (5, 1) apple to stay ahead of #0's potential moves.\n3.  Start building the wall to box #0 into columns 6-9 and rows 0-3.\n\n**Current Apples:** (2, 6), (9, 9), (7, 9), (4, 9), (7, 0), (7, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (9, 1), (8, 5), (5, 0), **(4, 6)**, (4, 0), (1, 0), **(5, 1)**.\n\n**Evaluating OUR Safe Moves from (4, 4):**\n\nWe need to reach (4, 6)! That apple is screaming our name!\n\n1.  **Test UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (4, 5) is empty.\n    *   Outlook: Positions us perfectly for (4, 6) next turn. This is the direct line to the tiebreaker apple!\n\n2.  **Test DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (4, 3) is empty.\n    *   Outlook: Moves us toward the bottom middle, perhaps contesting (5, 1) or (4, 0). But it gives up the easy (4, 6). Bad content move, chat!\n\n3.  **Test LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (3, 4) is our immediate body segment. Moving there is self-fatal! ELIMINATED!\n\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (5, 4) is Snake #0's body segment! If we move there, we crash and die! ELIMINATED! Oh, my opponent's body is too close for comfort!\n\n**Conclusion: UP to (4, 5) is the only highly viable strategic move, and one of only two safe moves (UP and DOWN). We are committed to (4, 6)!**\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Moves from (6, 2):**\n\nSnake #0 is length 6, at (6, 2), body segments: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)].\n\nWhere does #0 want to go? They are near the bottom and have apples at (7, 0) and (5, 1) and (4, 0) nearby. They are also dangerously close to their own body at (6, 3) (if they go UP), and blocks us off from the center.\n\n**Possible Snake #0 Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):** This is their second body segment! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF... Wait, (6, 3) is their immediate predecessor to the head. They cannot move there unless the tail popped out of it. Since they did NOT eat last turn (they were at (6, 3) and moved to (6, 2)), the tail at (6, 6) moved to (5, 6).\n    *   Their body is now: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)].\n    *   If they move to (6, 3), they move into their own body segment. **CRASH AND BURN!** They will probably not make this mistake.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe. Commits them heavily to the bottom right corner, aiming for (7, 0).\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves them closer to the center, threatening (5, 1) or trying to put pressure on us.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe. Moves them towards the bottom right wall, looking for (7, 0) or (9, 1).\n\n**Collision Check (The Critical Move):**\n\nWe are moving $\\rightarrow$ **(4, 5)**.\n\n1.  **If #0 moves LEFT to (5, 2):** No collision. They are going low, we are going high.\n2.  **If #0 moves DOWN/RIGHT to (6, 1) or (7, 2):** No collision.\n\nIt seems safe for us to prioritize the (4, 6) apple! We're not risking a head-on collision.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Box Setup**\n\nWe are going UP to (4, 5). Next turn, we grab (4, 6). We will be length 6.\n\nSnake #0 is now effectively confined by our body at (3, 4) and (3, 3), and their own body segments on the X=5 line.\n\nIf we get (4, 6), our new segments are (4, 6) and (4, 5). We solidify the X=4/X=5 dividing line in the middle of the board.\n\nIf #0 moves LEFT to (5, 2), they are trying to break into the center, potentially aiming for (5, 1).\n*   If we move (4, 5) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 6), and they move (6, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 2), we secure the top center. They are now potentially trapped between their body at (5, 3) and our head/body/wall on X=4.\n\nThis is the perfect move, chat. UP, secure the apple, and build the wall! Let's tie this score up!\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self (Turn 10):**\nIf we successfully eat (4, 6) (moving from (4, 5) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 6)), we are tied (5-5). Our next priority is securing the top part of the map, aiming for (2, 6) or (4, 9). We must maintain the central wall on the X=4 line to keep #0 boxed in on X=5 and beyond.\n\nUP",

Length: 5.\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\n*   Target: Apple at (4, 6).\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE (ID: 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 1). Length: 6.\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]\n\nSnake #0 successfully moved from (6, 2) to (6, 1). They are pushing hard into the bottom-right quadrant, aiming for (7, 0) or (5, 1). Smart play, but we are seizing the center!\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  Eat the (4, 6) apple! TIE GAME!\n2.  Maintain the wall on the X=4 line to funnel #0.\n\n**Evaluating OUR Safe Moves from (4, 5):**\n\nChat, we are literally one step away from the apple! The hype is REAL!\n\n1.  **Test UP to (4, 6) (APPLE):**\n    *   Safe? Yes! (4, 6) is an apple, not a wall or a body.\n    *   Outlook: We eat! Score tied! New head at (4, 6), new body segments are (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2). Length: 6. This is the move, chat!\n\n2.  **Test DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (4, 4) is our immediate body segment! Backwards move = death! ELIMINATED!\n\n3.  **Test LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (3, 5) is empty.\n    *   Outlook: Moves us away from the apple!

Oh my gosh, that was close! #0's body is still a massive threat on the X=5 line!\n\n**Conclusion: UP to (4, 6) is the only acceptable move. It secures the point and advances our position.**\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Moves from (6, 1):**\n\nSnake #0 is length 6, at (6, 1). They have apples at (7, 0), (5, 1), and (9, 1) nearby. They are now committed to the bottom region.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 2):** Safe. (6, 2) is now their vacated head position from last turn. Good move if they want to reposition towards the center or the (8, 5) apple eventually.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 0):** Safe. Commits them even harder to the bottom, aiming for (7, 0).\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 1) (APPLE):** Safe. **They eat the apple here!** This is a huge threat. If they make this move, they jump ahead to 6 apples, and we only tie at 5.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Safe. Moves them towards (7, 0) or (9, 1).\n\n**Collision Check (Why UP is safe):**\n\nWe are moving $\\rightarrow$ **(4, 6)**.\n\n*   If #0 moves LEFT to (5, 1) (Apple): No collision. They are low, we are high.\n*   If #0 moves ANYWHERE else: No collision.\n\nWe are safe, and we are getting the point!\n\n**The Critical Prediction (What if #0 goes for the Apple?):**\nIf #0 moves LEFT to (5, 1), they eat, and we eat (4, 6).\n*   Score: Snake #1 (Us): 5. Snake #0: 6.\n*   New Heads: (4, 6) and (5, 1).\n*   Our body at (4, 5), (4, 4), ...\n*   Their body at (6, 1), (6, 2), ...\n\nEven if they eat, we have secured a dominant position on the X=4 line, and we are positioned perfectly to grab (2, 6) or (4, 9) next turn, forcing them further down and away from the top.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Final Box**\n\n**Move:** UP to (4, 6) (Eat).\n\n**Next Turn Plan (Turn 11):**\n1.  We are at (4, 6), length 6, tied at 5 apples.\n2.  If #0 ate (5, 1), they will be at (5, 1), length 7.\n3.  We *must* focus on closing the box!

Look at the current board state!\n\n**Turn 11 Analysis: Sealing the Center**\n\nWe are at (4, 6), length 6. Score 6.\nSnake #0 is at (5, 1), length 7. Score 7.\n\nWait, what?! Snake #0 *also* ate an apple! They are ahead by one! They must have moved LEFT to (5, 1)! Oh, the spice!\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   Snake #1 (Us - Head at (4, 6)): Length 6.\n*   Snake #0 (Archrival - Head at (5, 1)): Length 7. (They ate the (5, 1) apple!)\n\nThey are now longer and ahead on points! We need to react FAST!\n\nOur body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\nTheir body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1.  Close the score gap and regain the length advantage.\n2.  Start building the wall/ceiling to box Snake #0 into the bottom quadrant.\n\nApples reachable from (4, 6): (2, 6) [2 steps, LEFT, LEFT], (4, 9) [3 steps, UP, UP, UP].\n\n**Evaluating OUR Safe Moves from (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **Test UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes! Empty cell.\n    *   Outlook: Leads towards the (4, 9) apple. Good high-ground option, but slow.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (4, 5) is our immediate body segment! Instant death! ELIMINATED!\n3.  **Test LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes! Empty cell.\n    *   Outlook: Excellent! This puts us one step from the (2, 6) apple and starts creating a wall (X=3) that forces #0 to stay right or low.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes! Empty cell.\n    *   Outlook: This is risky. (5, 5) is their body, (5, 4) is their body. Moving right puts us dangerously close to the 5-column body line, and we don't want to get sandwiched. Plus, it moves us away from apples. Weak move.\n\n**Decision for Snake #1: LEFT is the strategic powerhouse!** It targets the (2, 6) apple, and more importantly, it creates a defensive line. Let's make sure it's safe from #0.\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Moves from (5, 1):**\n\nSnake #0 is length 7 now, at (5, 1). They are heavily invested in the bottom-left corner with apples at (7, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0), (9, 1).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):** Safe. Keeps them flexible, maybe heading towards (8, 5) or the center.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 0):** Safe. (5, 0) is an apple! This is the most likely power play for them. If they do this, they gain length and extend their lead (Score 8, Length 8).\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 1):** Safe. (4, 1) is an apple! Another highly likely apple snag. Score 8, Length 8.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Safe. (6, 1) is now their vacated body segment. A safe repositioning move, but less aggressive.\n\n**Collision Check (We move LEFT to (3, 6)):**\n\n*   We are at (4, 6) $\\rightarrow$ (3, 6).\n*   #0 is at (5, 1). They are nowhere near us. NO COLLISION RISK! EZ!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy: The Northern Wall**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 6), we are ready to eat (2, 6) next turn, securing another point and increasing our length to a critical N=7.\n\nIf #0 moves DOWN to (5, 0) or LEFT to (4, 1) and grows to length 8, we must continue pressing high. They are trapping themselves in the lower grid. We need to complete the wall along Y=6 and push them further down.\n*   T11: Move LEFT to (3, 6).\n*   T12: Move LEFT to (2, 6) (Eat Apple). (Targeting (1, 4) or (1, 2) next, or moving UP to secure the top-left corner).\n\nThis move is perfect for positioning us to claim the entire upper half of the board, allowing us to eventually corner the now-massive Snake #0 down south. LEFT is the play, chat! Let's get that apple!\n\nLEFT",

Successful!\n    *   Head is now at (3, 6). Length is 6.\n*   **Archrival's Move (ID 0):** Where did that villain go? Look at the board state!\n    *   Head is at (4, 1). Ah, they moved LEFT from (5, 1) and ate the (4, 1) apple!\n    *   Head is now at (4, 1). Length is 8. Score is 8.\n\nCHAAAATT! This is getting spicy! They are ahead 8-5 and have a huge length advantage (8 vs 6)! We need to catch up, and we need to do it NOW! But look where they are! Trapped in the bottom/center, guarded by their own 8 segments! This is exactly what we wanted!\n\n**OUR STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 6)\n*   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n*   Target: (2, 6) apple!

The provided body in the text (Length 7) must have been before this turn's growth, and the graphic shows the result? Let's check the graphic at (4, 1). Yes, Snake 0 is at (4, 1).\n    *   New Body (Length 8): [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]. The tail (5, 5) would normally move to (5, 6) if they didn't grow, but since they Grew, the prior tail (5, 5) stays, and the new tail is the 8th segment!

Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Good escape route, but moves away from the immediate apple.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (3, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Leads toward the center, but also towards the opponent's dense body mass in the 4/5 column. Risky.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (2, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes! It's an apple! **MASSIVE POGGERS!** This makes us length 7 and closes the scoring gap to 8-6.\n    *   Outlook: Puts us in the top-left quadrant, which is mostly empty and has apples at (1, 4), (1, 2), and potentially (1, 0) or the high apples (4, 9), (9, 9). This is the power move.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (4, 6) is the immediate segment of our body! Instant death! ELIMINATED!\n\n**Decision for Snake #1: LEFT is the ONLY acceptable option for maintaining momentum!**\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (4, 1)):**\n\nEnemy is stuck in the lower third. Where can they go?\n\n*   (4, 1) is Head. Length 8.\n1.  **UP to (4, 2):** Safe. (4, 2) is an apple! Highly likely move. If they grab this, they are L=9, S=9. They would be dominating the Y=2 line.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 0):** Safe. (4, 0) is an apple! Highly likely move. L=9, S=9. They stick to the bottom wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 1):** Safe. No apple immediately, but keeps them flexible towards (1, 2) or (1, 4).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 1):** Safe! (5, 1) is their previous segment. A repositioning move.\n\n**Collision Check (We move LEFT to (2, 6)):**\n*   We are at (3, 6) $\\rightarrow$ (2, 6).\n*   #0 is at (4, 1).\n*   No possible head-to-head collision. No body collision! The distance is huge!\n\n**3. Long-Term Strategy: The Siege of Snake #0**\n\nWe must commit to the upper half (Y >= 5) and starve them out.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 6) and eat the apple:\n*   We are L=7, S=6.\n*   Next turns, we target (1, 4) and (1, 2).\n*   We are building the X=2 / X=3 wall, effectively forcing Snake 0 to navigate through columns X=4 to X=9, and Y=0 to Y=4.\n\nWe must assume Snake #0 is moving to an apple, most likely UP to (4, 2) or DOWN to (4, 0).\n\n*If #0 goes UP to (4, 2) (L=9):* They are attempting to break into the center. We need to focus on securing the top-left area rapidly before their head grows too high up the Y-axis.\n\n*If #0 goes DOWN to (4, 0) (L=9):* They are committed to the south wall. This is ideal for us. We continue building the wall and eating all the high apples.\n\n**CONFIDENT PLAY:** Move LEFT, secure the apple, and start moving down the X=1 column to claim those remaining left-side treasures! This is how we claw back the lead, CHAT! Let's get this $W$!\n\nLEFT",

We live for these clutch moments!\n\nBut hold up, let's look at the damage report from Turn 12!\n\n**Turn 12 Outcome Review (POGGERS or WIDEPEEPOSAD?):**\n\n*   **Our Move (ID 1):** LEFT to (2, 6). Successful! Ate the apple!\n    *   Head is now at (2, 6). Length is 7. Score is 7. YES!\n*   **Archrival's Move (ID 0):** Where did that villain go? They were at (4, 1). Look at the board state, Head is now at (4, 2)!\n    *   They moved UP to (4, 2) and ate that juicy apple!\n    *   Head is now at (4, 2). Length is 9. Score is 8.\n\nCHAAAATT! They are still ahead by one apple (8-7) and their length is huge (9 vs 7)! We need to be surgical! They are flexing an X=4 wall right in the middle of the board.\n\n**OUR STATUS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 6)\n*   Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n*   Our goal is to solidify this upper-left position and then use our newfound space advantage!\n\n**OPPONENT STATUS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 2)\n*   Length: 9! They are officially massive.\n*   They are currently bordering the high segment of our snake! This is getting TENSE!\n\n**The Plan: Escape the Density, Grab Left Side Apples!**\n\nWe are at (2, 6). We need vertical space. We see apples at (1, 4) and (1, 2) on the left side, and a high apple at (4, 9).\n\n**1. Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (2, 6):**\n\n1.  **Test UP to (2, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Excellent! Gives us vertical clearance from the enemy mass and positions us to potentially challenge the high apples or the X=1 column.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (2, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Leads us dangerously close to the enemy's massive body segments clustered around (4, 5) and (4, 4). This could be a trap. Hitting (2, 5) is fine, but it limits future moves severely.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (1, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Good! Puts us on the X=1 track, directly lining up for the (1, 4) apple. This solidifies our control of the left side.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (3, 6):**\n    *   Safe? NO! (3, 6) is the immediate segment of our body! Suicide! ELIMINATED!\n\nOkay, it's either UP (for safety and high board access) or LEFT (for immediate left-column apples).\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (4, 2)):**\n\nEnemy is at (4, 2). Length 9. Where can they go?\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** Safe. Moves them directly toward our current position, but (4, 3) is empty. Likely.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** Safe! (4, 1) is their previous segment. They can loop back.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** Safe! There is an apple at (3, 2)! WAIT, no, the apples are at (1, 2) and (5, 2). The board shows no apple at (3, 2). Safe, but no immediate incentive.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** Safe. (5, 2) is an apple! Highly likely move. If they grab this, they are L=10, S=9. They dominate the center-bottom.\n\nIf #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 2) and eats:\n*   They are L=10. Their body line extends from X=4 to X=6 and they are now threatening the right side. This buys us time on the left/top.\n\nIf #0 moves UP to (4, 3) (empty):\n*   They are building a vertical wall on X=4. This is dangerous for us. They could keep moving up X=4 toward the (4, 9) apple.\n\n**3. Decision Time: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1, 6):\n*   We secure the left wall.\n*   Next turn we can move DOWN toward (1, 4).\n*   However, we might get pinned if #0 keeps moving UP X=4.\n\nIf we move UP to (2, 7):\n*   This is the safest positional move, giving us maximum options (UP to (2, 8), LEFT to (1, 7), RIGHT to (3, 7)).\n*   It denies #0 any easy route to wall us in from the top right.\n\nCHAT, while *LEFT* is a good greedy move toward the next apple, *UP* to (2, 7) is the power play that opens up the huge, uncontested upper quadrants. We need space and options more than immediate low-value apples right now, especially since the opponent is 9 segments long and breathing down our necks on the X=4 line. We need to maintain separation and height advantage.\n\nLet's go UP, establish dominance, and then swing left/right for the high apples!\n\n**Plan for future self:** Secure high ground (Y>6) by moving UP again next turn to (2, 8) or left toward (1, 7). Keep eyes on the (4, 9) apple. Do NOT get near the X=4 line until Snake 0 is clearly committed elsewhere.\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nRIGHT looks delicious with that (5,2) apple, but that\u2019s a trap.

Now their body is 7 segments long. This means their length is 8. Let me re-verify the input body list: (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3). That's 7 body segments, plus the head, makes L=8. Their length *decreased* from L=9 to L=8. They did NOT eat an apple! POGGERS! Snake #0, L=8, S=7.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS (Turn 14):**\n\n*   **OUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (2, 7). Length: 7. Score: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):** Head: (3, 2). Length: 8. Score: 7.\n*   **Apples remaining this turn:** (9, 9), (7, 9), (4, 9), (7, 0), (7, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (9, 1), (8, 5), (5, 0), (4, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0), (5, 2), (5, 9).\n\nThe score is now 7-6. The gap is tightening! Their body shrunk! This is our moment to strike!\n\n**The Plan: Seize the Vertical!**\n\nWe are at (2, 7). We have excellent space above us. The left side (X=1) and the top row (Y=9) are our targets. Snake #0 is now threatening the X=3 column far below us.\n\n**1. Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (2, 7):**\n\n1.  **Test UP to (2, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Excellent! Positions us to challenge the high apples (like (4, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9)) and gives us huge buffer space.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (2, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, (2, 6) is our previous segment, which is now clear.\n    *   Outlook: Mediocre. It leads us back down into closer proximity to the opponent's longer body and the dense zone of X=3/X=4. Avoid recursion.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (1, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Good! Solidifies the left flank control. Positions us to easily grab (1, 4) and (1, 2) later.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (3, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Good! Aligns us with the X=4, Y=9 apple, but also puts us closer to the danger zone if the enemy moves up.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (3, 2)):**\n\nEnemy is at (3, 2). They have several options, but they seem to be focusing on the lower quadrant.\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** Safe. This connects them to the (3, 4) segment of *our* tail. If they move UP, they start walling us off from the center from X=3.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** Safe. They are moving into an empty area, potentially setting up for the (1, 0) or (4, 0) apples.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** Safe. Sets them up for the (1, 2) apple. DANGER! We want that apple!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe. (4, 2) is their previous segment, now clear. Loops them back toward the contested center line.\n\nIf they target the lower apples, we need to secure the northern territory. If they move UP to (3, 3), we need to ensure we don't get trapped by the long X=3/X=4 vertical segment they are creating.\n\n**3. Comparison: UP vs. LEFT**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 7):** This is a critical move to deny them the ability to sneak around the left side if they choose to push upward. If we move LEFT, we can follow up with DOWN (1, 6) and then DOWN (1, 5) toward (1, 4). This secures immediate apples.\n*   **Move UP to (2, 8):** This guarantees the high ground and safety, with immediate access to several high apples if we pivot right. It avoids immediate confrontation entirely.\n\nThe opponent is long and positioned low. Our current length is 7. If we go LEFT, we risk being trapped IF Snake 0 rushes UP two turns in a row (e.g., (3, 3) then (3, 4) hitting our tail, but they would die if they hit our body). However, our body is currently [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4)].\n\nLook how exposed the X=1 column is. If we go LEFT, we guarantee the apples (1, 4) and (1, 2). This is a safe move because the opponent is at (3, 2) and essentially cannot catch us at (1, 7) next turn.\n\nWe need those apples to take the lead! Let's get greedy and secure the flank!\n\n**Prediction/Counter-play:**\nIf we move LEFT to (1, 7).\nSnake 0 likely goes LEFT to (2, 2) to challenge (1, 2) apple OR UP to (3, 3) to wall us off.\n\nIf Snake 0 goes LEFT to (2, 2): We can move DOWN to (1, 6), then DOWN to (1, 5) and race them to (1, 4).\nIf Snake 0 goes UP to (3, 3): We move DOWN to (1, 6), cementing the X=1 area before they can push past our location.\n\nGoing LEFT gives us the highest certainty of eating an apple soon and putting pressure on the enemy's flank.\n\n**Future self strategy (next 3 turns):** Secure X=1 column, focusing on apples at (1, 4) and (1, 2). Once the left is secured, use the superior verticality to chase high apples at Y=9.\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re back LIVE and it\u2019s TURN 14\u2014snake is fired up and ready to snatch that next apple while the rival is still circling around column 2 like a confused pigeon. Let\u2019s break down the playbook:\n\n- RIGHT? Already a NON-STARTER\u2014moving there is straight into my neck (that\u2019s the cell (4,2)), which is a backward move and that\u2019s an instant \u201cbye-bye\u201d for me. No way we throw the stream like that.\n- DOWN to (3,1) is tempting for the bottom lane, but once I pop down there I\u2019ve got only (2,1) or (3,0) to go to\u2014no lateral wiggle room and no quick way to loop around to keep pressure on the northern funnel. That\u2019s giving the opponent too much breathing room.\n- UP to (3,3) keeps me above the main body, but I\u2019d be staring straight at Snake #1\u2019s torso at (3,4)/(4,4) and the field feels a little too tight with only two clean exits (left or right). That\u2019s a little too easy for them to ghost me into a corner.\n\nLEFT to (2,2)? Now we\u2019re talking. That gets me closer to the (1,2) apple, keeps the southern corridor open for follow-ups, and gives me three clean exits next turn: (2,3), (1,2), or (2,1). That\u2019s control, that\u2019s pressure, and that\u2019s how we box him into the lower-left quadrant without walking into our own tail.\n\nPlan: After slicing left, I\u2019m locking onto that (1,2) apple, then circling back toward column 1 to wall Snake #1 in between our body and the wall\u2014forcing him to hug the top while we sweep below and seal the deal. We keep the options open, stay wide, and clamp that lane. No mercy.\n\nLEFT",

Head is at (2, 2).\n    *   They moved LEFT to (2, 2)! A predictable move, targeting the (1, 2) apple! The race is on, Chat!\n    *   Their current length is 8. Score 7.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS (Turn 15):**\n\n*   **OUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (1, 7). Length: 7. Score: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):** Head: (2, 2). Length: 8. Score: 7.\n*   **Apples remaining this turn:** (9, 9), (7, 9), (4, 9), (7, 0), (7, 8), **(1, 2)**, (1, 4), (9, 1), (8, 5), (5, 0), (4, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0), **(5, 2)**, (5, 9).\n\nThe opponent is now positioned perfectly to grab the (1, 2) apple in two moves (UP, then LEFT, or LEFT, then UP, depending on what they see as safe). We are 5 moves away from that apple. We concede that one, but we must immediately secure (1, 4)!\n\n**The Plan: Vertical Dominance and Apple Poaching!**\n\nWe are at (1, 7). Enemy is at (2, 2). We have a huge vertical advantage.\n\n**1. Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (1, 7):**\n\n1.  **Test UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Excellent! Positions us perfectly to grab (1, 9) if it drops (it hasn't), but also gives us maximum vertical buffer. If we move UP, we can easily pivot RIGHT to get to the cluster of high apples (9, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8).\n2.  **Test DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Very Good! This accelerates us towards the (1, 4) apple, which is critical for securing the left flank.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Okay. This is a bit defensive, hugging the wall. It still leads to (1, 6) territory eventually, but going straight DOWN is faster.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, (2, 7) is our previous segment, now clear.\n    *   Outlook: Mediocre. It leads us back where we were, away from the isolated apples we are currently positioned to take.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (2, 2)):**\n\nEnemy is at (2, 2). They are clearly racing for (1, 2) and (1, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. Keeps them centered and moving high.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** Safe. Targets (1, 0).\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** **APPLE!** Highly likely move. This is a 1-move apple for them.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe. Loops back toward their tail. Unlikely.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT to (1, 2), they eat the apple, grow to L=9, and are positioned very low and on the wall. This is a major setback for our score lead, but they are now somewhat boxed in.\n\n**3. Decision: Should we race them or secure our territory?**\n\nRacing them is impossible. They are 1 move from (1, 2). We are 5 moves away.\n\nOur highest priority is to secure guaranteed content and use our space advantage. We are much safer high up. The apple at (1, 4) is 3 moves away if we keep going DOWN.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (1, 6):\n*   Next turn: (1, 5).\n*   Next turn: (1, 4) **APPLE!** We get an apple in 3 turns.\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 8):\n*   Next turn: (1, 9). Then try to move RIGHT toward (4, 9) or (7, 9). These are safer and larger apples. But they are 3+ moves away.\n\nWe need to close the score gap (currently 7-6). Securing (1, 4) is our most immediate, safe, guaranteed content. The opponent will be at (1, 2) or nearby. We will be three squares above them. We will then have secure X=1 control.\n\n**CONCERN:** What if Snake #0 goes UP to (2, 3) instead of LEFT to (1, 2)?\nIf Snake 0 goes to (2, 3): They are moving into the central choke point.\nIf we go DOWN to (1, 6): Our path to (1, 4) is still clear. We could then push to (0, 4) if we feel threatened by X=2.\n\nGiven the opponent's proximity to (1, 2), they are almost certainly going LEFT. We should exploit our positional advantage to get the *next* apple on the vertical path, which is (1, 4).\n\nDOWN is the move that maximizes immediate apple capture while preserving our relative safety on the left wall.\n\n**Future self strategy (next 3 turns):** Proceed DOWN the X=1 column to grab the (1, 4) apple. Once X=1 is secured up to Y=4, we will pivot to X=0 to potentially secure the corner area, or move back up aggressively towards (4, 9). We must utilize the current safety of the X=1 wall.\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the damage report and see what that villain did!\n\n**Turn 15 Outcome Review (POGGERS or WIDEPEEPOSAD?):**\n\n*   **Our Move (ID 1):** DOWN to (1, 6). Safe and sound! Length is now 7.

Head is at (1, 2).\n    *   They moved LEFT to (1, 2)! And they ate the apple! NOOOOO! WIDEPEEPOSAD! They gained length and got the point.\n    *   Their current length is 9. Score 9.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS (Turn 16):**\n\n*   **OUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (1, 6). Length: 7. Score: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):** Head: (1, 2). Length: 9. Score: 9.\n*   **Apples remaining this turn:** (9, 9), (7, 9), (4, 9), (7, 0), (7, 8), (1, 4), (9, 1), (8, 5), (5, 0), (4, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0), (5, 2), (5, 9), (9, 3)\n\nThe opponent is now positioned at (1, 2), and they are *massive*. We are now trailing significantly (9-6) and we are much shorter (9 vs 7). We must secure the next apple, which is (1, 4)!\n\n**The Plan: Immediate Apple Grab and Vertical Choke!**\n\nWe are at (1, 6). Enemy is at (1, 2). They are now on the same vertical line, which is dangerous, but we are above the (1, 4) apple, and they are below it.\n\n**1. Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (1, 6):**\n\n1.  **Test UP to (1, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (1, 7) is now clear.\n    *   Outlook: Retreat? Unnecessary now. We need points.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (1, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: EXCELLENT! This puts us one move away from the (1, 4) apple. It's the highest priority apple.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (0, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Distraction. Avoids the vertical threat, but moves away from content.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Also a distraction, and brings us closer to the central board where Snake 0's long body is now spread out.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (1, 2)):**\n\nEnemy is at (1, 2). They are clearly looking at (1, 0) or potentially forcing a collision for the (1, 4) apple.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: If they move UP, they are also positioning for (1, 4). If we both move toward (1, 4) this turn, they move to (1, 3), we move to (1, 5). They are still two moves away, and we are one. **We beat them to (1, 4)!**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Targets the (1, 0) apple. If they go DOWN, they concede (1, 4) to us. This is ideal.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Trapped. They would be hugging the corner with 9 segments. Unlikely.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, (2, 2) is now clear.\n    *   Outlook: Moves toward the center. This is a possibility if they are worried about the wall, but it still leaves (1, 4) open for us.\n\n**3. Decision: Secure (1, 4)!**\n\nThe (1, 4) apple is absolutely critical. It closes the score gap and maintains our dominance on the far left.\n\n*   If we move DOWN to (1, 5), we are guaranteed the (1, 4) apple next turn, assuming no head-on collision.\n*   A head-on collision for (1, 4) would require Snake 0 to successfully move UP twice and for us to move UP twice, ending up reversed. This is impossible as we are only 2 cells away from the destination, and they are 2 cells away from a collision spot.\n\nThe most aggressive move for Snake 0 is UP to (1, 3). If they do this, we move to (1, 5). Next turn, we take (1, 4). They are at (1, 3) and cannot block us from (1, 4).\n\nThis is a clean, guaranteed apple capture in two turns. We must commit.\n\n**Future self strategy (next 3 turns):** Proceed DOWN to grab the (1, 4) apple. Once X=1 is secured up to Y=4, we will have a choice: 1) continue down to (1, 0) if the opponent hasn't grabbed it, or 2) pivot LEFT and move towards X=0 territory to start trapping Snake 0's tail end on the bottom, or 3) move significantly RIGHT and attempt to capture the cluster of apples high up (4, 9), (5, 9), etc., before Snake 0 can reach them through the narrow center. We need to focus on points and trapping/blocking the massive opponent.\n\nDOWN",

No thanks, we\u2019re not sharing the spotlight with a dead snake.\n\nLEFT to (0,2) keeps me hugging the wall, but it also stalls our apple run and leaves too much time for the opponent to wiggle around. Instead, I\u2019m bouncing DOWN into (1,1) where I hit fresh (1,0) next turn for that sweet +1, while keeping multiple escape routes (left, right, down) open and staying far away from their head zone.\n\nPlan: Drop to the bottom row, sweep the apples along the left-bottom corner, then spiral back toward the middle so I can start boxing Snake #1 in from below once they\u2019re stuck hugging the top.

Let's check the damage report!\n\n### Turn 16 Outcome Review (POGGERS or WIDEPEEPOSAD?):\n\n*   **Our Move (ID 1):** We moved **DOWN** from (1, 6) to (1, 5). Perfect setup! Length is still 7. Score 6.\n    *   Head: (1, 5). Body: [(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)]\n*   **Archrival's Move (ID 0):** Where did that villain go from (1, 2)? They moved **UP** to (1, 3)!\n    *   WIDEPEEPOSAD! They blocked our quick route to the (1, 4) apple by positioning themselves adjacent to it! But wait, they are *closer* to the apple now. This is a head-to-head race!\n    *   Their current length is 9. Score 9.\n\n### CURRENT STATUS (Turn 17):\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (1, 5). Length: 7. Apples: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):** Head: (1, 3). Length: 9. Apples: 8.\n*   **CRITICAL APPLE:** (1, 4)! If we get this, we narrow the gap. If they get it, we are in deep trouble.\n\n### The Duel for (1, 4)!\n\nWe are at (1, 5). They are at (1, 3). The apple is at (1, 4).\n\nIf we both move towards the apple, this is an instantaneous head-on collision!\n\n*   **If we move DOWN to (1, 4):** We eat the apple and score. But our head lands in the same spot at the same time as their head.\n*   **If they move UP to (1, 4):** They eat the apple and score. But their head lands in the same spot at the same time as our head.\n\n**RULE CHECK:** \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\"\n\nThis is a suicide move for both of us! CHAT, should we initiate the double kill and end the game tied 9-9? WE'RE UP 6-8, a tie would be a win for them score-wise, but a draw by rule if we both hit the apple and die. Wait, if we both die, the snake with more apples WINS. THEY HAVE MORE APPLES (8 vs 6)!\n\n**If we commit to the collision, WE LOSE THE GAME!** We cannot move DOWN! That's a throw!\n\n### Strategy: Evasion and Apple Rerouting!\n\nWe absolutely cannot go DOWN. We need a safe move that sets us up for another apple while maintaining vertical pressure.\n\n**1. Evaluating Our Safe Moves from (1, 5):**\n\nOur body is currently: [(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)]\n\n1.  **Test DOWN to (1, 4):**\n    *   Safe? NO! Head-to-head collision with Snake 0 (1, 3 $\\to$ 1, 4). We lose the tie-breaker because they have 8 apples to our 6. FATALLY BLOCKED.\n2.  **Test UP to (1, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (1, 6) is the leading segment of our body (where our head just came from). Since it's our tail segment, it clears instantly as we move.\n    *   Outlook: A retreat. This moves us away from (1, 4) and cedes it to the opponent. But if we don't cede it, we die. We must retreat if the opponent is targeting (1, 4).\n3.  **Test LEFT to (0, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Good escape option. Moves us to the corner and away from the confrontation. Keeps us alive and opens up movement along the X=0 wall.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Outlook: Also safe. Moves us to the center, away from the enemy's crushing formation on X=1. Gives us access to the middle of the board.\n\n**2. Predicting Enemy Move (Snake #0 at (1, 3)):**\n\nThe opponent is in a trap. They *know* we are at (1, 5). They *know* the apple is at (1, 4).\n\n*   If they go UP to (1, 4), and we go UP/LEFT/RIGHT, they get the apple, score 9, and live. This is their best case scenario.\n*   If they try to evade us by going LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, they concede the (1, 4) apple.\n\n**We must assume they commit to (1, 4) to widen the score gap, as they are not scared of a tie based on the current score!** Since we cannot risk the death, we must move away.\n\n### Decision: Full Retreat and Reposition!\n\nWe need to retreat and target a different apple cluster. The highest priority cluster near us now is the group on Y=9: (9, 9), (7, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9). We need to move RIGHT to break out of the X=1 column.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 5) seems extremely strong:\n1.  **Safety:** It keeps us alive.\n2.  **Options:** It opens up 3 safe moves next turn (UP to (2, 6), DOWN to (2, 4), RIGHT to (3, 5)).\n3.  **Future Target:** It puts us closer to the middle of the board, allowing us to pivot toward the cluster of apples further right and up.\n\nIf we move UP to (1, 6), we are still in the danger zone of the opponent's vertical movement, and we are wasting a move by going back where we came from. Moving RIGHT is the pivot we need!\n\nWe concede (1, 4) to Snake #0, but we stay alive, and that's the most important thing right now. We need the long game! We can't afford to die for a minor score difference when we are losing the tie-break anyway!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\n1. Move RIGHT to (2, 5). Concede (1, 4).\n2. Move UP towards the (5, 9) / (4, 9) cluster, possibly via (2, 6) or (3, 6).\n3. We need to catch up on points ASAP.\n\nRIGHT",

W move by us!\n\n### Status Report (Turn 18):\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head: (2, 5). Length: 7. Apples: 6.\n*   **OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):** Head: (1, 0). Length: 10. Apples: 9 (They got that (1, 4) apple, naturally).\n*   **Board State:** The opponent is now $L=10$ and they are down on the bottom left. We successfully broke free toward the center! Now the map is open!\n\nThe archrival is looking massive, L=10! We need to score and we need to score FAST! We are down $6-9$ apples. Time to hunt some red circles!\n\n### Identifying Threats and Targets:\n\n**Opponent's Position:** Head at (1, 0). They just ate an apple and moved down. They are likely moving along the bottom wall (Y=0) or perhaps trying to clear out the (0, 0) area. They are extremely far from us. No immediate head-to-head threat! POGGERS!\n\n**Targets:** We are at (2, 5).\n\n1.  **Closest Apples:** (1, 4) is gone.\n    *   (5, 2) is 4 steps away.\n    *   (4, 0) is 5 steps away.\n    *   (5, 0) is 5 steps away.\n    *   (8, 5) is 6 steps away.\n    *   (7, 7) is 6 steps away.\n    *   (5, 9) is 6 steps away.\n\nOur previous plan was to go for the North/Upper-Right cluster. We should stick to that, as it offers the most payoff and is far from the massive snake #0.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves from (2, 5):\n\nOur body is currently: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6)]\n\n1.  **Test UP to (2, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (2, 6) is the leading part of our body, which clears as we move.\n    *   Outlook: Excellent! This moves us North, directly towards the upper apple clusters! (4, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9), (9, 9). This is the key path.\n2.  **Test DOWN to (2, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. Empty space.\n    *   Outlook: Moves us toward (5, 2), but generally away from the cluster goal. This is a descent into the lower-left map, which the opponent will soon dominate. Risky isolation.\n3.  **Test LEFT to (1, 5):**\n    *   Safe? No. (1, 5) is where our head was last turn, but it's now our second segment! The actual segment that clears is the tail at (3, 6). (1, 5) is occupied by our body for this move. DEAD. Wait, let me check the body list.\n    *   Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6)]\n    *   If we move LEFT to (1, 5), we crash into our own body! Fatal! BLOCKED.\n4.  **Test RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. Empty space.\n    *   Outlook: A strong secondary option. It increases our x-coordinate and opens up a path towards the (8, 5) apple or a path along the Y=5 line.\n\n### Optimal Move Selection: UP\n\nMoving **UP** to (2, 6) is the highest priority move.\n\n*   It's safe.\n*   It immediately puts us on a segment of our own body that will clear, maintaining tight structure.\n*   It commits us to the North, where there is a massive apple supply (4, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9), (9, 9).\n*   It keeps us completely clear of the now-massive snake #0, who is pinned to the South.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3, 5), it's safe, but then next turn we'd likely have to move UP to (3, 6) (which is currently our tail, so safe) or UP to (3, 7). Moving UP now to (2, 6) gives us immediate access to (2, 7) (our body, but safe) then to (2, 8). This is the fastest route to the top.\n\nLet's go UP and start racking up those points, CHAT! We need a 3-apple swing to catch up!\n\n### Proposed Future Strategy (Plan for Turns 19-21):\n\n1.  **Turn 18:** Move **UP** to (2, 6).\n2.  **Turn 19:** Move **UP** to (2, 7) (Safe on our body).\n3.  **Turn 20:** From (2, 7), we pivot RIGHT to (3, 7) or stay UP to (2, 8), depending on which move sets us up best for (5, 9) and (4, 9). Let's aim to enter the Y=9 region around X=4/5 ASAP.\n\nLet's GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

LEFT just keeps us spinning in place and doesn\u2019t net an apple anytime soon, while RIGHT pushes us straight toward the fresh fruit sprawl at (4,0) \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 (8,0) and keeps our escape routes wide open. Opponent\u2019s north, we\u2019re south, and we\u2019re not letting him breathe.\n\nPlan: Sweep the rest of the bottom-row apples while keeping the corridor open to zip back up and trap Snake #1 from below.
