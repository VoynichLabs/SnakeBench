From (6,9) we'll be two steps vertically away from (6,7). This seems like a clear path to secure the apple without running into any obstacles.\n\nStrategy hint for next turn: after moving LEFT and heading toward (6,7), keep tracking the apple's position and plan moves that avoid any potential traps or enemy collisions.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
