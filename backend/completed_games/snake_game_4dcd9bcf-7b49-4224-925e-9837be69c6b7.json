It maintains high maneuverability with multiple safe options at (3,3) (e.g., LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3), DOWN to (3,2)), and avoids potential traps like the upper edge or deeper into enemy-occupied bottom areas (enemy head at (4,1) unlikely to collide head-on; their LEFT to (3,1) or UP to (4,2) keeps separation). RIGHT to (4,4) offers similar 3 follow-ups but drifts farther away, requiring 5+ moves to reach (1,2) instead of 4, and risks later getting stuck on the right edge. UP to (3,5) limits to 3 follow-ups but heads toward a less central zone far from key apples like (1,2), and DOWN's path keeps options open for pivoting to (2,0) or (0,0) later while staying alive.\n\nLong-term plan: After this DOWN, aim to eat (1,2) via LEFT path (e.g., LEFT next, then LEFT, DOWN). Post-eat, reassess for (2,0) or (8,7), prioritizing high-option routes and avoiding bottom-left enemy clustering.\n\nDOWN",
