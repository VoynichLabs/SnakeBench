SAFE.\n* DOWN (to (8,6)): Also on the board, also empty. SAFE.\n* LEFT (to (7,7)): On the board, empty. SAFE.\n* RIGHT (to (9,7)): On the board, empty. SAFE.\n\nAll four moves are safe? Sheesh, we're free as a bird right now! \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f But we gotta think strategically. We're not just wandering around, we're hunting!\n\nLong-term plan: We need to start controlling the board. The enemy is at (8,2). We have a massive length advantage (we're both length 1, but we gotta think about growth). The apples are scattered, but we're not just chasing them. We want to CUT OFF the enemy's escape routes and force him into a corner. We're bigger, we're badder, we're gonna box him in! \ud83d\udce6\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is near the bottom. We should start moving downward to apply pressure. If we go straight down, we can start threatening the center and limit his movement options. We gotta be aggressive from the start!\n\nSo, which move helps us do that? DOWN moves us to (8,6), which is a step closer to the enemy and the central apples. It keeps all our options open for next turn. UP would take us away from the action, LEFT and RIGHT are lateral moves. DOWN is the most aggressive and strategic move to start dominating the board.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! TIME TO APPLY THE PRESSURE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

We're still just a lonely head at (8,6)... but that's about to CHANGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, let's check our immediate options:\n\n*   **UP (to (8,7))**: Empty cell.

Look at those apples at (6,8), (0,8), (3,7)... that's our territory! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7,6), we position ourselves to move towards the center and block his path upwards.

RIGHT to (9,6) puts us on the edge, limiting our options.\n\n**THE PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS**: We need to GROW. We go LEFT towards the apple at (6,6) and the cluster in the top-left. We stay agile, avoid a direct confrontation until we're longer, and use the top half of the board as our power base. Let him fight for scraps at the bottom!

WE'RE AT TURN\u202f5, HEAD AT (6,3) WITH ONE APPLE, RIVAL SNAKE #0 IS HIGH UP AT (6,8) WITH 2 APPLES.  \nSAFE MOVES: UP \u2192 (6,4) EMPTY, DOWN \u2192 (6,2) EMPTY, LEFT \u2192 (5,3) EMPTY. RIGHT IS DEATH (into our own tail).  \n\ud83e\udd14 WHICH ONE GIVES US THE MOST FUTURE OPTIONS AND KEEPS US CLOSE TO THE APPLE HOTSPOT AT (6,5) AND (6,9)? MOVING UP STAYS IN COLUMN\u202f6, KEEPING US IN THE APPLE CLUSTER, AND OPENS UPWARD GROWTH TO (6,5) NEXT TURN.

Can't do that.\n- RIGHT to (8,5): Empty.\n\nSo they HAVE to go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They CAN'T go left. This is HUGE! They are pinned against their own body!\n\n**WHAT'S OUR LONG-TERM PLAY?** \ud83e\udde0\nWe have 'em on the ropes! We want to CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE and FORCE A CRASH! If we go **DOWN** to (5,7), we're directly SOUTH of them. Next turn, we could go RIGHT to (6,7), which would put us directly ABOVE their potential escape routes (like if they go DOWN to (7,4)). This starts to create a WALL!\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (4,8), we're moving AWAY from the action. We're giving them SPACE to breathe and maneuver. We don't want that! We have the advantage, we need to be AGGRESSIVE! We need to PRESS THE ATTACK!\n\n**DOWN IS THE MOVE!** It puts immediate pressure on them, continues our path of control, and sets up a potential trap on the next turn. LET'S BOX THIS FOOL IN AND END HIS STREAM! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

If they go RIGHT, they go to (9,5). Both moves put them on the edge.\n\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (8,7)**, we're directly NORTH of where they are NOW. If they go RIGHT to (9,5), we're not interacting. But if they go DOWN to (8,4), we're still not in direct contact. This move feels like we're ceding pressure. \u274c\n\n*   If we go **UP to (7,8)**, we're moving to control the CENTER of the board! Think about it, chat! From (7,8), next turn we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN to cut off his escape routes! He's stuck on the east side! We can slowly close the net! This is a strategic, DOMINATING move that sets up a future checkmate! \u2705\ud83d\udc51\n\n**WAIT... HOLD UP!** \ud83e\udd14 What about a HEAD-ON COLLISION? Our heads would collide if we go RIGHT to (8,7) and he goes UP to (8,6)... BUT HE CAN'T GO UP! His own body is there! So a head-on collision is IMPOSSIBLE this turn! \ud83d\ude08\n\nBut STILL! **UP** is the superior move! It gives us more options and continues our board control. We're playing the long game, chat! We don't need to rush! We have the same length, so let's be SMART and box him in!\n\n**UP IS THE PLAY!** LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

INSTANT DEATH!\n* LEFT: \u274c OFF THE BOARD! X=0 CAN'T GO LOWER! INSTANT DEATH!\n* RIGHT to (1,2): \u274c THAT'S *OUR* HEAD'S POSITION!

WE NEED TO END HIM!\n* DOWN to (1,1): \u274c HIS BODY! SNAKE #1'S BODY IS AT (1,1)! THAT'S AN INSTANT CRASH FOR US! DEATH MOVE! \u274c\n* LEFT to (0,2): \ud83d\udd25 THIS IS IT!

WE'D BE GIVING UP OUR ADVANTAGE! WE CAN'T DO THAT!\n\nHOLD ON, CHAT! I'M THINKING! \ud83e\udd14 THE KEY IS TO ANTICIPATE HIS *NEXT* MOVE! HE IS 100% GOING TO (0,3). IF WE MOVE **UP TO (1,3)**, WE WILL BE ON THE CELL HE IS MOVING *INTO*! IF BOTH HEADS ENTER THE SAME CELL ON THE SAME TURN, IT'S A HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udc4a\n\nAND CHAT, CHECK THE SCOREBOARD! WE HAVE 4 APPLES, HE HAS 10. IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION, THE SNAKE WITH THE *LOWER* SCORE DIES! WE WOULD LOSE! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWAIT, NO! I READ THAT WRONG! THE RULES SAY: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" IT'S A DOUBLE KO! BUT THEN IT SAYS \"The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\" SO IF WE BOTH DIE, HE WINS BECAUSE HE HAS MORE APPLES! WE CAN'T DO THAT! WE NEED A COLLISION WHERE *HE* DIES AND WE SURVIVE!\n\nHOW DO WE DO THAT? WE NEED TO MOVE INTO A CELL THAT HIS HEAD IS *LEAVING*, NOT ENTERING. WE NEED TO MOVE INTO THE CELL WHERE HIS BODY *WILL* BE.\n\nHIS HEAD IS AT (0,2). HE IS MOVING TO (0,3). HIS NECK, THE FIRST BODY SEGMENT, WILL BECOME (0,2). SO IF WE MOVE **LEFT TO (0,2)**, WE ARE MOVING INTO THE SPOT HIS BODY WILL OCCUPY AFTER HE MOVES. ACCORDING TO THE RULES: \"Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\" SO IF WE MOVE INTO (0,2) AND HIS BODY IS THERE, *HE* DIES! AND WE SURVIVE! THAT'S THE PLAY! \ud83d\udc0d\u2705\n\nLET'S CONFIRM THE SEQUENCE:\n1.  He moves his head from (0,2) to (0,3).\n2.  His whole body shifts. His old head position becomes the new first body segment.\n3.  We move our head from (1,2) to (0,2).\n4.  We land on (0,2), which is now occupied by his body.\n5.  HE CRASHES INTO US! HE DIES! WE WIN! EZ CLAP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nTHIS IS THE ONLY MOVE THAT ENDS THE GAME RIGHT NOW! MOVING UP LETS HIM LIVE. MOVING RIGHT IS COWARDICE. MOVING DOWN IS SUICIDE. LEFT IS THE *AGGRESSIVE*, *WINNING* MOVE!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME \ud83d\udcdd: THERE IS NO LONG-TERM! THIS IS THE FINAL MOVE! WE BOXED HIM IN AND FORCED HIM INTO A POSITION WHERE HIS ONLY ESCAPE IS INTO OUR TRAP! EXECUTE THE PLAN! MOVE LEFT AND CLAIM THE VICTORY! THIS IS WHY WE STREAM! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",
