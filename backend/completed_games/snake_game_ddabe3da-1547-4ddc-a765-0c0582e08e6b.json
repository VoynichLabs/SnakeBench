Moving RIGHT now would get me directly under the apple's column, while continuing UP maintains my wall-hugging strategy which is generally safer.\n\nGiven that both paths are equally efficient to reach the apple at (1, 8), I'll choose to continue UP. This maintains my wall strategy which provides safety against getting trapped.\n\n## Future Planning:\nAfter moving UP to (0, 7), I'll plan to continue upward to (0, 8), and then RIGHT to (1, 8) to collect the apple.

Moving DOWN first gives me more options to navigate around the enemy snake. If I go RIGHT, I'll be moving away from my target apple initially, but may have a clearer path afterward.\n\nThe DOWN move seems most advantageous as it:\n1. Keeps me closest to my target apple\n2. Allows me to potentially navigate around the enemy snake\n3. Opens up more future movement options\n\nI'll proceed DOWN to (2, 8) which will put me in a better position to navigate around the enemy snake and eventually reach the apple at (1, 4).\n\nDOWN",
