Check for obstacles:\n  - There are no snakes at (2, 4) or (3, 4).\n  - No walls in this path; moving right stays within bounds.\n  - Enemy snake at (5, 2) is away; no threat there.\n\nOptions like UP, DOWN, or LEFT are less optimal this turn because:\n\n- UP would go to (1, 5): no apple there, and potentially risky if the apple at (6, 1) is aimed for later.\n- DOWN would go to (1, 3): no immediate benefit.\n- LEFT would go to (0, 4): only the wall obstacle, which would kill us.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT, heading towards the apple at (4, 4) for the next move.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

The last move was UP, so the previous move indeed brought us to (4,7).\n- There are apples at (9,4), (2,6), (4,0), (0,4), and (5,2).\n- Our current position is (4,7) \u2014 quite high up on the board.\n- Our immediate goal is to reach an apple, preferably the closest one. Let's see which apple is most accessible.\n\nFrom (4,7):\n\n- The apple at (2,6) is two left, one down (diagonally), but our current position is (4,7). Moving left would bring us to (3,7), then (2,7), then down to (2,6). \n- Alternatively, moving down first might make sense if apples are below us, but the apple at (2,6) seems reachable.\n  \nHowever, I notice that the apple at (2,6) is directly to the left if we go through (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). \n\nOther apples are further away:\n\n- (9,4) is far to the right\n- (0,4) is to the far left\n- (4,0) is directly below, but an extra few moves away\n- (5,2) is to the right and below\n\nNext, possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: From (4,7) to (3,7). Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

Check for obstacles:\n  - There are no snakes at (2, 4) or (3, 4).\n  - No walls in this path; moving right stays within bounds.\n  - Enemy snake at (5, 2) is away; no threat there.\n\nOptions like UP, DOWN, or LEFT are less optimal this turn because:\n\n- UP would go to (1, 5): no apple there, and potentially risky if the apple at (6, 1) is aimed for later.\n- DOWN would go to (1, 3): no immediate benefit.\n- LEFT would go to (0, 4): only the wall obstacle, which would kill us.\n\nTherefore, the best move is RIGHT, heading towards the apple at (4, 4) for the next move.\n\nNext move: RIGHT.",

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (4,7), with one body segment at (4,6). The last move was UP, so the previous move indeed brought us to (4,7).\n- There are apples at (9,4), (2,6), (4,0), (0,4), and (5,2).\n- Our current position is (4,7) \u2014 quite high up on the board.\n- Our immediate goal is to reach an apple, preferably the closest one. Let's see which apple is most accessible.\n\nFrom (4,7):\n\n- The apple at (2,6) is two left, one down (diagonally), but our current position is (4,7). Moving left would bring us to (3,7), then (2,7), then down to (2,6). \n- Alternatively, moving down first might make sense if apples are below us, but the apple at (2,6) seems reachable.\n  \nHowever, I notice that the apple at (2,6) is directly to the left if we go through (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). \n\nOther apples are further away:\n\n- (9,4) is far to the right\n- (0,4) is to the far left\n- (4,0) is directly below, but an extra few moves away\n- (5,2) is to the right and below\n\nNext, possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: From (4,7) to (3,7). Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (4,7), with one body segment at (4,6). The last move was UP, so the previous move indeed brought us to (4,7).\n- There are apples at (9,4), (2,6), (4,0), (0,4), and (5,2).\n- Our current position is (4,7) \u2014 quite high up on the board.\n- Our immediate goal is to reach an apple, preferably the closest one. Let's see which apple is most accessible.\n\nFrom (4,7):\n\n- The apple at (2,6) is two left, one down (diagonally), but our current position is (4,7). Moving left would bring us to (3,7), then (2,7), then down to (2,6). \n- Alternatively, moving down first might make sense if apples are below us, but the apple at (2,6) seems reachable.\n  \nHowever, I notice that the apple at (2,6) is directly to the left if we go through (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). \n\nOther apples are further away:\n\n- (9,4) is far to the right\n- (0,4) is to the far left\n- (4,0) is directly below, but an extra few moves away\n- (5,2) is to the right and below\n\nNext, possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: From (4,7) to (3,7). Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

No, it's empty.\n- Moving left from (3,7) to (2,7): also clear.\n- Moving down from (2,7) to (2,6): the apple there, so this route captures it efficiently.\n\nAlternatively:\n- Moving vertically from the current position might risk running into the snake's body or walls if not carefully planned. Our snake's body is at (2,7) and presumably extending downward; but since we only have one body segment at (2,7), moving left seems safe.\n\nIs there any immediate threat from the enemy snake at (6,2)? No, it's far away.\n\nNext, I want to prepare for moving toward the apple at (2,6).

The last move was UP, so the previous move indeed brought us to (4,7).\n- There are apples at (9,4), (2,6), (4,0), (0,4), and (5,2).\n- Our current position is (4,7) \u2014 quite high up on the board.\n- Our immediate goal is to reach an apple, preferably the closest one. Let's see which apple is most accessible.\n\nFrom (4,7):\n\n- The apple at (2,6) is two left, one down (diagonally), but our current position is (4,7). Moving left would bring us to (3,7), then (2,7), then down to (2,6). \n- Alternatively, moving down first might make sense if apples are below us, but the apple at (2,6) seems reachable.\n  \nHowever, I notice that the apple at (2,6) is directly to the left if we go through (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). \n\nOther apples are further away:\n\n- (9,4) is far to the right\n- (0,4) is to the far left\n- (4,0) is directly below, but an extra few moves away\n- (5,2) is to the right and below\n\nNext, possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: From (4,7) to (3,7). Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

This keeps us safe and gets us closer to y=4, where the apple is, at (4,4).\n- Next, we can navigate towards the apple by moving right after reaching higher y-coordinates.\n\nNext move: UP.\n\n**Next strategic plan:**\n- Move upward to (2,5), then plan to go right once we're slightly higher in y, avoiding the body and potential threats.\n\nMy decision: UP.",

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (4,7), with one body segment at (4,6). The last move was UP, so the previous move indeed brought us to (4,7).\n- There are apples at (9,4), (2,6), (4,0), (0,4), and (5,2).\n- Our current position is (4,7) \u2014 quite high up on the board.\n- Our immediate goal is to reach an apple, preferably the closest one. Let's see which apple is most accessible.\n\nFrom (4,7):\n\n- The apple at (2,6) is two left, one down (diagonally), but our current position is (4,7). Moving left would bring us to (3,7), then (2,7), then down to (2,6). \n- Alternatively, moving down first might make sense if apples are below us, but the apple at (2,6) seems reachable.\n  \nHowever, I notice that the apple at (2,6) is directly to the left if we go through (3,7) -> (2,7) -> (2,6). \n\nOther apples are further away:\n\n- (9,4) is far to the right\n- (0,4) is to the far left\n- (4,0) is directly below, but an extra few moves away\n- (5,2) is to the right and below\n\nNext, possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: From (4,7) to (3,7). Is the space (3,7) safe? Our own body is at (4,6); moving LEFT to (3,7) should be safe unless there's an obstacle or enemy. The enemy snake's head at (6,1) is far away; no threat there.\n\n- **RIGHT**: To (5,7): if we go RIGHT, we'd move closer to (5,2), but that is farther. The apple at (9,4) is on the right, but four moves away, so a direct move RIGHT may be unnecessary now.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would go to (4,8). That's away from immediate apple targets, and the space looks safe.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (4,6) would bring us onto our body's current position, which we should avoid, or perhaps more correctly, Since our body is at (4,6), moving DOWN would be onto (4,6) which is occupied by ourselves \u2014 dangerous. Therefore, moving DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, check for possible collisions:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (3,7) seems safe, and directly approaching the closest apple at (2,6). Next move, we can go LEFT, then DOWN to (2,6). But is that optimal?\n  \n- Alternatively, moving UP advances vertically towards the apple at (2,6), moving from (4,7) to (4,8). To get to (2,6), we'd need to go LEFT twice and DOWN once.\n\nConsidering the immediate options, moving LEFT seems more direct toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nNow, check if moving LEFT is safe:\n\n- Cell (3,7): no apple, no snake body there, safe.\n- Cell (2,7): next to (2,6) apple, safety depends on if it will be safe when we reach it. But we plan to go LEFT first to reach (3,7), then LEFT again to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6). We need to ensure these moves don't cause collision with own body or enemy snake.\n\nOur own body loop:\n\n- Currently at (4,7), body at (4,6).\n\nMoving LEFT:\n\n- (3,7): safe\n\nNext move again LEFT:\n\n- (2,7): safe\n\nNext move DOWN:\n\n- (2,6): apple position, safe to eat.\n\nThus, path:\n\n(4,7) -> LEFT (to 3,7)\n\n(3,7) -> LEFT (to 2,7)\n\n(2,7) -> DOWN (to 2,6), eating apple.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT initially seems good. Alternatively, moving UP:\n\n- Move from (4,7) to (4,8): safe and general movement towards the top.\n\nBut that moves away from the focus on reaching the (2,6) apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps move toward the apple at (2,6) directly:\n\n- Moving LEFT first seems viable.\n\nBetween options, I think moving LEFT now aligns with moving toward the apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids unnecessary exposure to other directions that are farther or more dangerous.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Moving LEFT from (4,7) to (3,7) is safe.\n- Next move, more leftwards, then down to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my decision: **LEFT**.\n\nNext turn, I will plan to move LEFT again, then DOWN to collect the apple.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**.",

Our snake's body is at (2,7) and presumably extending downward; but since we only have one body segment at (2,7), moving left seems safe.\n\nIs there any immediate threat from the enemy snake at (6,2)?
