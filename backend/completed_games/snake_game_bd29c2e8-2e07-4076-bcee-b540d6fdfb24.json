Since there are no immediate threats with the enemy snake at (8, 0), I have some freedom to explore.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\n1. **Target Apples**: After consuming the apple at (4, 5), my next aim would be to decide among moving UP to (4, 6) or DOWN to (4, 4). Moving UP gives me access to row 6, while DOWN allows me to head towards (3, 3) where another apple is located. The move to (4, 4) keeps me flexible for the next turn.\n  \n2. **Avoid Potential Collisions**: Consider avoiding moving too close to enemy snake locations, especially since I will be growing and need to create paths that keep me from wrapping or colliding inadvertently.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nI will move LEFT to (4, 5) to consume the apple. \n\n### Final Move Output\nLEFT"
