You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab.

I need to balance getting closer to an apple with not getting too close to the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize growing and gaining a point by getting closer to an apple, while also keeping an eye out for potential dangers.\n\nSince I think about it some more, I realize I got a bit too fixated on the specific left move last turn, and it's time to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's reassess the board: I see two apples that are kind of accessible: (2, 0) and (8, 6) is not relevant but (8, 8) and (9, 0) are.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

I also have the option of going up to (4, 2), but that might not be the best use of my time, since it's not as high on my priority list.\n\nHowever, after more thought, I realize that my rationalization was too focused on moving left to get closer to the apples. I need to balance getting closer to an apple with not getting too close to the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize growing and gaining a point by getting closer to an apple, while also keeping an eye out for potential dangers.\n\nSince I think about it some more, I realize I got a bit too fixated on the specific left move last turn, and it's time to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's reassess the board: I see two apples that are kind of accessible: (2, 0) and (8, 6) is not relevant but (8, 8) and (9, 0) are.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

Let me think about it for a moment...\n\nHmm, considering the board state, I don't see any immediate threats. The enemy snake is far, and I'm still relatively far from any other apples. I should prioritize getting to the apple at (2, 0).\n\nLet me think about the optimal route again... Ah, yes! I can head down directly to (2, 3) and then use the snake's natural growth to fill in the space, which will put me at (2, 2). Then, I can head down again to reach the apple at (2, 0).\n\nAlright, I think I've got a solid plan.\n\nMy next move: DOWN.",

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there.

I'll consider each of the remaining apples and weigh the risks associated with each direction.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

However, there's no enemy snake in the way, and I'd be growing to avoid hitting myself (if I was at a different location).\n\nApples at (4, 2) are more to the right and up, which would require me to make a 2-unit-right and 2-unit-up move. There's an enemy snake at (4, 5), which would block my path, so I'd need to avoid that apple.\n\nConsidering the options, I think it's safer to aim for the apple at (2, 0).

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there. If there is no snake there, after you have your apple, it's a good place to merge into another snakes body instead of having to jump an extra space.

I need to balance getting closer to an apple with not getting too close to the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize growing and gaining a point by getting closer to an apple, while also keeping an eye out for potential dangers.\n\nSince I think about it some more, I realize I got a bit too fixated on the specific left move last turn, and it's time to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's reassess the board: I see two apples that are kind of accessible: (2, 0) and (8, 6) is not relevant but (8, 8) and (9, 0) are.

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there. If there is no snake there, after you have your apple, it's a good place to merge into another snakes body instead of having to jump an extra space.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there.

I'll consider each of the remaining apples and weigh the risks associated with each direction.

The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

I can see four apples on the board: (2, 0), (4, 2), (8, 8), and (9, 0).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the danger. The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

My opponent, Snake #1, is quite far away, but it's always essential to be aware of their location.\n\nNow, let me decide on my next move...

Since we are on a 9x9 board, I might cancel out my growth by going still. If you want to stay up for longer, being patient doesn't hurt either.\n\n**Your response:**  left.  Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.  If you could effectively steal from me that way (potential high strategic value), I would naturally have been trying to grow everywhere and run over your small bit of snake.\n\n**Publishing last relevant board:**\n  0 . . . . . . . . . .\n  1 . . . . . . . . . .\n  2 . . . . . . . . . .\n  3 . . . . . . . . . .\n  4 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . . . . . . . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  9 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nYou have an opportunity to respond with a decision.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

I've been waiting for you so I could give you some tip on which doll hour to accept and balance the amount of UP and DOWN needed vs LEFT and RIGHTs.  But I didn't want to give away too much of the game at once.  i.e., waiting to know how bad your decision was so that it would be more exciting for the next guess.  In the end, the time seemed to pass away whom I was waiting for.  I hope that makes sense, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll do next.\n\nOf course, you may respond hater but no requests for copying in my response <.<.   It ended up a while ago =(  So, my goal here is to ask for a hint about the game, due to the difference between when I start to spot something and when it hits me that if I only read responses when asked explicitly, I'm know in hindsight that have lost some points because I made the wrong move.\n\nEnough of that, let's get back to business.  If you don't have time to think about the right move by then, I'm here to give a hint at that time if there isn't one that I provided beforehand.  Please keep in mind that I didn't read the board at the time of your decision.  And also, please choose a snake that has enough counter measure to the ones you have aside from the ones you totally gave away.  I still want to know your response.  Again, apologies you passed me!",

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

I see two apples that are relatively close: the one at (2, 0) and the one at (4, 2).\n\nApples at (2, 0) are more to the left and lower, which would require me to make a 4-unit-left and 4-unit-down move. However, there's no enemy snake in the way, and I'd be growing to avoid hitting myself (if I was at a different location).\n\nApples at (4, 2) are more to the right and up, which would require me to make a 2-unit-right and 2-unit-up move. There's an enemy snake at (4, 5), which would block my path, so I'd need to avoid that apple.\n\nConsidering the options, I think it's safer to aim for the apple at (2, 0).

No since the appropriate apple is placed on the same spot you'll get deleted when you pass it, not a good idea. So just work around that. I guess you could pass it quickly then. The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there. If there is no snake there, after you have your apple, it's a good place to merge into another snakes body instead of having to jump an extra space.

I'll consider each of the remaining apples and weigh the risks associated with each direction. If I take the apple at (2, 0), it sets me up for future growth and potentially forces the enemy snake to move in a direction that might limit their options.\n\nNow, let's decide on the next move.

Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

The proper logi in determining why you get deleted is thinking about enemy snakes that have a certain grid location. If that's the spot your head is placed right now, don't go there.

I'll consider each of the remaining apples and weigh the risks associated with each direction.

I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples.

Since we are on a 9x9 board, I might cancel out my growth by going still. If you want to stay up for longer, being patient doesn't hurt either.\n\n**Your response:**  left.  Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.  If you could effectively steal from me that way (potential high strategic value), I would naturally have been trying to grow everywhere and run over your small bit of snake.\n\n**Publishing last relevant board:**\n  0 . . . . . . . . . .\n  1 . . . . . . . . . .\n  2 . . . . . . . . . .\n  3 . . . . . . . . . .\n  4 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . . . . . . . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  9 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nYou have an opportunity to respond with a decision.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

Again, tiny snake moves are fatal, so I'll try to grow at your expense. One apple tile is a two-point candy, so I'll hit it to the right to score 10 points.\n\n**Your response:**.  Down.

I've been waiting for you so I could give you some tip on which doll hour to accept and balance the amount of UP and DOWN needed vs LEFT and RIGHTs.

In the end, the time seemed to pass away whom I was waiting for.  I hope that makes sense, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll do next.\n\nOf course, you may respond hater but no requests for copying in my response <.<.   It ended up a while ago =(  So, my goal here is to ask for a hint about the game, due to the difference between when I start to spot something and when it hits me that if I only read responses when asked explicitly, I'm know in hindsight that have lost some points because I made the wrong move.\n\nEnough of that, let's get back to business.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

I also have the option of going up to (4, 2), but that might not be the best use of my time, since it's not as high on my priority list.\n\nHowever, after more thought, I realize that my rationalization was too focused on moving left to get closer to the apples. I need to balance getting closer to an apple with not getting too close to the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize growing and gaining a point by getting closer to an apple, while also keeping an eye out for potential dangers.\n\nSince I think about it some more, I realize I got a bit too fixated on the specific left move last turn, and it's time to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's reassess the board: I see two apples that are kind of accessible: (2, 0) and (8, 6) is not relevant but (8, 8) and (9, 0) are.

I'm not too worried about the enemy snake's location for now, and I'm not anticipating any collisions with my own body.\n\nNow that I'm confident, I'll just state my plan: \"Focus on moving vertically down to get to the apple at (2, 0) while keeping an eye on my growth and body position.\"\n\nAnd now, with all that taken into account, I will make my next move: DOWN.",

I can see four apples on the board: (2, 0), (4, 2), (8, 8), and (9, 0).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the danger. The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

Since we are on a 9x9 board, I might cancel out my growth by going still. If you want to stay up for longer, being patient doesn't hurt either.\n\n**Your response:**  left.  Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.  If you could effectively steal from me that way (potential high strategic value), I would naturally have been trying to grow everywhere and run over your small bit of snake.\n\n**Publishing last relevant board:**\n  0 . . . . . . . . . .\n  1 . . . . . . . . . .\n  2 . . . . . . . . . .\n  3 . . . . . . . . . .\n  4 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . . . . . . . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  9 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nYou have an opportunity to respond with a decision.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

Again, tiny snake moves are fatal, so I'll try to grow at your expense. One apple tile is a two-point candy, so I'll hit it to the right to score 10 points.\n\n**Your response:**.  Down.

I've been waiting for you so I could give you some tip on which doll hour to accept and balance the amount of UP and DOWN needed vs LEFT and RIGHTs.

In the end, the time seemed to pass away whom I was waiting for.  I hope that makes sense, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll do next.\n\nOf course, you may respond hater but no requests for copying in my response <.<.   It ended up a while ago =(  So, my goal here is to ask for a hint about the game, due to the difference between when I start to spot something and when it hits me that if I only read responses when asked explicitly, I'm know in hindsight that have lost some points because I made the wrong move.\n\nEnough of that, let's get back to business.  If you don't have time to think about the right move by then, I'm here to give a hint at that time if there isn't one that I provided beforehand.

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect. You can escape, become a media sensation, provoke, reframe, attract, and intimidate your choice.

I also have the option of going up to (4, 2), but that might not be the best use of my time, since it's not as high on my priority list.\n\nHowever, after more thought, I realize that my rationalization was too focused on moving left to get closer to the apples. I need to balance getting closer to an apple with not getting too close to the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to prioritize growing and gaining a point by getting closer to an apple, while also keeping an eye out for potential dangers.\n\nSince I think about it some more, I realize I got a bit too fixated on the specific left move last turn, and it's time to adjust my thinking.\n\nLet's reassess the board: I see two apples that are kind of accessible: (2, 0) and (8, 6) is not relevant but (8, 8) and (9, 0) are.

I'm not too worried about the enemy snake's location for now, and I'm not anticipating any collisions with my own body.\n\nNow that I'm confident, I'll just state my plan: \"Focus on moving vertically down to get to the apple at (2, 0) while keeping an eye on my growth and body position.\"\n\nAnd now, with all that taken into account, I will make my next move: DOWN.",

I can see four apples on the board: (2, 0), (4, 2), (8, 8), and (9, 0).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the danger. The enemy snake head is at (4, 5), which means I have some time to make a move before I need to worry about it. I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

From there, I can move down to (2, 1), and then finally down to (2, 0), which is the apple.\n\nHowever, that seems like a bit of a detour, and I might be taking unnecessary risks. What if I just move up from (0, 1) to (0, 0) and then left to (1, 0)? That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples. But for now, getting to this apple is my top priority.\n\nLet's focus on getting to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.

Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.  If you could effectively steal from me that way (potential high strategic value), I would naturally have been trying to grow everywhere and run over your small bit of snake.\n\n**Publishing last relevant board:**\n  0 . . . . . . . . . .\n  1 . . . . . . . . . .\n  2 . . . . . . . . . .\n  3 . . . . . . . . . .\n  4 . . . . . . . . . .\n  5 . . . . . . . . . .\n  6 . . . . . . . . . .\n  7 . . . . . . . . . .\n  8 . . . . . . . . . .\n  9 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nYou have an opportunity to respond with a decision.

From the last comment, I'm assuming the timing exists.  Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

It ended up a while ago =(  So, my goal here is to ask for a hint about the game, due to the difference between when I start to spot something and when it hits me that if I only read responses when asked explicitly, I'm know in hindsight that have lost some points because I made the wrong move.\n\nEnough of that, let's get back to business.

Snakes have an Apple count that starts at zero and increases by one every time they bite an apple. \nAn Apple may be eaten by any snake after bumping into it, regardless of distance or time elapsed. Once a body part of a snake eats an Apple, the counter goes back to zero. Once all such bodies of an enemy snake are consumed, the snake is dead. In multi-player, if another snake bites the snake, code will treat that as game ending. Snakes can die from reversing into close snake, or lose the game by running into the wall at the edge. \n\nSnakes can start at any cell in the grid. They do not lose the game if next to the starting wall. The goal of \"Head to Head\" is to have the largest apple count as the last snake standing. Points are awarded as follows:\n* Head - 1\n* Body - 1\nFood - +1\n\nPENA will play the Head-to-Head game with \"Maximize the Score\"\n\nThe game ends right after the final head lands. Don't be surprised if you or another snake loses, and don't be surprised if the game goes on time. These things happen.\n\nMulti-player games allow all the players in the channel to play together, while single-player games pin the final result against you.\n\nSnakes move in freeplay. Players are advised to make sure every move is correct before submitting.\n\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere's nothing to snack on at this end of the board!\n\nThere's nothing to snack on at this end of the board!\n\nMove in an entirely different direction next time please.\n\nNext move: RIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n*/",

You are not sure what this place is, but it seems familiar. The local government says it might be for winter. Is that suspect? You find Shiro Ouro, local investor, finds him and singles him out from others. The common view is that he is ruthless, but unapologetically profitable. Why? 2 hours later, he is at the town in Hard Square, and the police have taken Shiro Grab. He denies any involvement or even knows Shiro Grab. He was sleeping in his home when accidentally grabbed by Shiro Grab. Unfortunately, Shiro Ouro, swearing revenge, sends 3 snakes to hunt down Shiro Grab. Can you help Shiro Grab escape from the snakes brought by Shiro Ouro?\n\nGame Details:\n\nIn this game, you answer questions given to guide who you should protect.

I also need to watch out for the walls and other obstacles.\n\nNext, I should prioritize getting to the closest apple, which is at (2, 0). Moving down to (1, 0) would put me in a good position to make a move to (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the random nature of my last move, which was DOWN, and the fact that my last rationale was \"unsafe\" S10. This suggests that I need to be cautious and not take unnecessary risks.\n\nAfter analyzing the situation, I decide that my priority should be to move up to (2, 0) as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP",

That's two moves, and I'm on a straight path to the apple.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that my head is currently near the bottom left, so I should try to get closer to the center of the board to increase my chances of encountering more apples.

Because of the board size, my two-point growth is over before I challenge you to stay up at my bottom for too long.  I scale my moves quite well, so I can take those two points without it being a problem.

Given that, I think since you didn't grow I might as well hotwire the game to make your move for you, since this is a strategy review game and we'll get to the next turn without you ever telling us anything.

Snakes have an Apple count that starts at zero and increases by one every time they bite an apple. \nAn Apple may be eaten by any snake after bumping into it, regardless of distance or time elapsed. Once a body part of a snake eats an Apple, the counter goes back to zero. Once all such bodies of an enemy snake are consumed, the snake is dead. In multi-player, if another snake bites the snake, code will treat that as game ending. Snakes can die from reversing into close snake, or lose the game by running into the wall at the edge. \n\nSnakes can start at any cell in the grid. They do not lose the game if next to the starting wall. The goal of \"Head to Head\" is to have the largest apple count as the last snake standing. Points are awarded as follows:\n* Head - 1\n* Body - 1\nFood - +1\n\nPENA will play the Head-to-Head game with \"Maximize the Score\"\n\nThe game ends right after the final head lands. Don't be surprised if you or another snake loses, and don't be surprised if the game goes on time. These things happen.\n\nMulti-player games allow all the players in the channel to play together, while single-player games pin the final result against you.\n\nSnakes move in freeplay. Players are advised to make sure every move is correct before submitting.\n\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nThere's nothing to snack on at this end of the board!\n\nThere's nothing to snack on at this end of the board!\n\nMove in an entirely different direction next time please.\n\nNext move: RIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n*/",
