UP (3,6) – empty, on board\n2. DOWN (3,4) – apple here, empty, on board\n3. LEFT (2,5) – empty, on board\n4. RIGHT (4,5) – occupied by my own body (don’t do it)\n\n**Immediate Apple Opportunity:**\n- DOWN to (3,4) grabs another apple immediately!\n- UP heads toward (4,7) apple if I want to chain apples upward.\n- LEFT is safe but does not get an apple.\n\n**Safety & Growth Considerations:**\n- DOWN is optimal: grabs apple, grows snake, keeps me away from wall, and sets up for further options.\n- After moving DOWN, possible next moves:\n    - (3,3) – down, blank space, eventually for (4,2) apple.\n    - UP (3,5) – will just be my own body segment if don’t move tail off.\n    - LEFT (2,4) – open.\n    - RIGHT (4,4) – open for now, but body moves may block it.\n- I should not box myself along the left or bottom walls – but I’m at y=4, so plenty of space.\n\n**Look ahead:**\n- Eating at (3,4), my snake grows. New body and tail sequence.\n- As my snake’s body increases, watch carefully for self-collision, especially in tight corridors.\n- Enemy is nowhere near – still no threat.\n- After eating this apple, decision: chase (4,2) next (down and then right), or swing back upward for apples at (4,7).\n\n**Strategy note to myself:**\n- Chain apple eating efficiently, but always maintain space for turning and avoiding self-collision.\n- Next move after DOWN may likely be DOWN again toward (3,3) and then RIGHT to (4,2).\n- If board gets congested, I can reverse course upward, so don't let myself run out of exits.\n\n**Move Decision:**\n- Best: DOWN (to (3,4)) – eat another apple, grow, maximize score and maintain options.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN**\n\n*(Moving DOWN to (3,4) to eat apple, grow again, and set up for further apples below or looping back up as needed.)*",
