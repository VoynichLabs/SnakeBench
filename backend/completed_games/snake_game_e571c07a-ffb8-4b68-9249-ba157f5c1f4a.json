According to the current state, the snake should now be at (7, 1), but the last move was TO (6, 1), heading left. So, the snake's current head position needs to be clarified.\n\nReviewing the provided info:\n- Previous move was LEFT, moving from (8, 1) to (7, 1). However, the last move information states:\n  > Your snake's head is at (7, 1), and it just moved LEFT from (8, 1) to (7, 1). The last move resulted in me being at (7, 1).\n\n- The snake's body is at [(5, 1)]. That suggests the snake's length is perhaps 1 initially, but since it just ate an apple, it may have grown.\n\n- To proceed safely, I want to get the apple at (6, 1). Moving RIGHT (from (7, 1) to (8, 1)) would take me to (8, 1) which is away from the apple at (6,1). Moving LEFT towards (6,1) seems optimal.\n\n- Moving LEFT from (7, 1) to (6, 1) will allow eating the apple at (6, 1), increasing length and points.\n\n- Moving UP or DOWN might not lead to immediate rewards or safety, especially as no apples are directly nearby in those directions.\n\n- I need to ensure I won't crash into walls or enemy snakes:\n  - Walls are at edges. Moving LEFT to (6, 1) is safe.\n  - Enemy snake at (2, 4) is far away\u2014no threat.\n  - My body is only at (5, 1), so moving into (6, 1) is safe for now.\n\n**Next move decision: LEFT**\n\nNext planned strategy:\n- After eating the apple at (6, 1), I will look to navigate toward other apples, especially at (1, 4) or (0, 7), to maximize points.\n\nTherefore, the immediate move: **LEFT**.",
