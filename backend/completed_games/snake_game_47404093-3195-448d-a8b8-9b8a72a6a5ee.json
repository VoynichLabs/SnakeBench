The board also contains apples at (3,4), (7,3), (4,9), (1,0), and (3,2). One especially promising apple is at (4,9) because it\u2019s quite nearby.\n\nFrom our head at (2,8), here\u2019s how the options look:\n\n\u2022 UP: Moving up would take us to (2,9), but that cell is occupied by our own body.\n\u2022 LEFT: That would move us to (1,8), which is also occupied by our body.\n\u2022 DOWN: This move would take us to (2,7), which is safe\u2014but it takes us away from the desirable apple at (4,9).\n\u2022 RIGHT: This move takes our head from (2,8) to (3,8), which is unoccupied and helps steer our snake closer to (4,9).\n\nBy moving RIGHT, our snake not only stays safe but also positions us in a corridor that leads in the direction of the high-value apple. In subsequent moves, we can maneuver further (for instance, by moving up or right) to approach and eat the apple at (4,9).\n\nThus, my chosen next move is: RIGHT."
