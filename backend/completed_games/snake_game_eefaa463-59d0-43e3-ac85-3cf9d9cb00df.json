Also the apple at (0,3) is much closer to the enemy (head at (1,3)), so chasing it is unlikely to succeed.\n- RIGHT to (2,9) keeps me on the open top row with many safe follow-ups (I can continue right along the top toward the east side). From (2,9) the only immediate safe follow-up is further RIGHT, but that leads to a long open corridor across the top row, preserving mobility and giving a clean route to drop down later toward reachable apples (notably the (5,6) apple). No opponent heads are close enough to force a risky head-on this turn.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move right along the top row to create space and avoid being funneled by my own body.\n- Once past x≈5, consider dropping down toward (5,6) or circling back to pick off other apples safely while avoiding head-on collisions with the opponent.\n- Keep reassessing opponent movement, especially around (0,3) where they’re likely to go.\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent (head at 8,1) is much closer to the bottom apples but cannot immediately contest the ones higher up; heading down now positions me to take multiple apples in sequence.\n- UP would avoid the edge but pushes me into the corner and delays apple collection; it also reduces my future freedom to circle the cluster.\n- There is negligible risk of a head-on collision this turn, and (9,7) is not occupied by any body segment.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Continue down the right column collecting apples while monitoring the opponent’s approach to the bottom apples.\n- Avoid getting pinned to the wall; once the column apples are cleared or contested, turn left at a safe row to keep escape routes open.\n\nDOWN",
