This is a good candidate.\n\n3. **LEFT:** (6, 5)\n   - This is safe but does not immediately lead to an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** (8, 5)\n   - This is safe but does not immediately lead to an apple.\n\n### Evaluating Directions:\n- **Down** is the most direct and immediate path to an apple, which is a high priority.\n- **Up** is a safe alternative but does not immediately help with apple collection.\n- **Left** and **Right** are also safe but less directly beneficial.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 1). If we move down to (7, 4), the enemy could move up to (4, 2) or right to (5, 1) or left to (3, 1) or down to (4, 0). None of these would immediately threaten our position, so we are safe.\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note:\n- **Immediate Goal:** Eat the apple at (7, 3) as soon as possible.\n- **Next Steps:** After eating, we should grow and expand our body to cover more ground and avoid collisions with the enemy.\n- **Monitor Enemy:** Keep an eye on the enemy's position and plan to avoid any potential collisions.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe safest and most beneficial move is to go **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",

Collected 1 apple.\n- **Apples left**: (8,4), (4,8), (1,0), (7,0), (6,8).\n- **Enemy**: Head at (6,1), no body segments yet (will die if it grows or collides).\n- **Board**: Your snake occupies (7,3) and (7,4). Enemy occupies (6,1).\n\n### Immediate Safety Checks:\n1. **Off-board**: All directions are safe (board is 10x10, y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top).\n2. **Self-collision**:\n   - Moving **UP** to (7,2): No overlap with body (body is at (7,4)).\n   - Moving **DOWN** to (7,4): Overlaps with body (tail). **Immediately invalid**.\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (6,3): No overlap.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (8,3): No overlap.\n3. **Enemy collision**:\n   - Enemy is at (6,1). Its next move could be:\n     - UP to (5,1) (safe for you).\n     - DOWN to (7,1) (safe for you).\n     - LEFT to (5,1) (safe for you).\n     - RIGHT to (7,1) (safe for you).\n   - No immediate overlap risk in any direction.\n\n### Safe Moves:\n- **UP**: (7,2)\n- **LEFT**: (6,3)\n- **RIGHT**: (8,3)\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- Closest apple is at (7,4), which is directly behind your head (y=3 to y=4). Moving **DOWN** would eat it, but that\u2019s invalid due to self-collision.\n- Next closest apples are (8,4) and (7,0), both farther away.\n\n### Follow-Up Moves:\n1. **UP to (7,2)**:\n   - Next turn, your body will be [(7,4), (7,2)]. Head at (7,2).\n   - Possible moves: UP to (7,1), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2).\n   - Avoiding enemy: Enemy at (6,1) could move UP to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1). No immediate risk.\n   - Long-term: This keeps the snake oriented vertically, which is safer for avoiding enemy paths.\n\n2. **LEFT to (6,3)**:\n   - Next turn, body will be [(7,4), (6,3)]. Head at (6,3).\n   - Possible moves: UP to (5,3), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3).\n   - Risk: Enemy could move RIGHT to (7,1) or UP to (5,1). If enemy grows, it could reach (6,3) in 2 turns (e.g., (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3)).\n   - Less safe than UP.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,3)**:\n   - Next turn, body will be [(7,4), (8,3)]. Head at (8,3).\n   - Possible moves: UP to (8,2), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,3), RIGHT to (9,3).\n   - Risk: Enemy could move RIGHT to (7,1) or UP to (5,1). No immediate overlap, but horizontally expanding could be risky if enemy grows.\n   - Less safe than UP.\n\n### Enemy Behavior:\n- Enemy is alone and has no body. It will die if it grows or collides. No immediate threat.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n1. **Prioritize vertical expansion**: Moving UP to (7,2) keeps the snake oriented vertically, reducing risk of enemy collisions. This also opens a path toward the apple at (7,0) in 3 turns (down twice).\n2. **Avoid horizontal expansion**: Moving LEFT or RIGHT could expose the snake to enemy growth paths.\n3. **Monitor enemy**: If enemy grows, prioritize avoiding paths that lead to its potential reach. For now, UP is safest.\n\n### Final Move:\nUP",
