The enemy snake, #1, is at position (2, 6). \n\nSince my last move was RIGHT, I am now at position (2, 5). I should consider moving towards the closest apple, which is (2, 7) or (4, 6). Moving up towards (2, 7) seems like a good option, as it is directly above me and I can potentially get to it before the enemy snake does. \n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (4, 6), which is closer to my current position than (6, 9) and might be a safer option. However, moving towards (4, 6) would require me to move RIGHT again, which could potentially put me in a vulnerable position if the enemy snake decides to move down in my direction.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position at (2, 6), moving UP seems like the safest move, as it allows me to get closer to the apple at (2, 7) without immediately putting me in danger of running into the enemy snake or a wall.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the apple at (2, 7) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adjusting my path if necessary.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Now my current position is (2,7). \n\nCurrent assessments:\n\n- Apples remain at (7,2), (5,1), (4,6), and (6,9).\n- The closest apple now appears to be at (4,6), which is directly to my RIGHT (x increases from 2 \u2192 4) and DOWN (y decreases from 7 \u2192 6). It's only two spaces away.\n- This apple at (4,6) is very close and can be reached immediately in a short two-move path: RIGHT to (3,7), then RIGHT again to (4,7), and finally DOWN to (4,6).\n- Enemy snake #2 is currently at (2,5), below my position, but this doesn't currently interfere with reaching the target apple at (4,6).\n\nConsidering this, the best move is clearly to head towards (4,6). My first step is to go RIGHT, as this more directly progresses me towards the apple.\n\nStrategy Reminder for next move:\nContinue moving RIGHT toward (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6) to quickly claim the apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
