          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's break this down. Turn 0, we're both just heads, no body yet. My head at (4,2), enemy head at (7,8). Apples everywhere, but we're playing the long game \u2014 we need to dominate space and force the enemy into a bad spot.\n\nFirst, check all four moves from (4,2):\n- **UP** to (4,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (4,1): Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,2): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,2): Empty. Safe.\n\nAll moves are safe right now \u2014 no walls, no bodies.\n\nBut we gotta think about the enemy. Where's he likely to go? He's at (7,8). Closest apples to him are (9,9), (0,9), (1,9), (7,6), (7,3). He'll probably go toward (9,9) or (7,6). So he's far away for now \u2014 no immediate collision risk.\n\nWe want to **control the center** and **grow early** to get a length advantage. Look at apples near us: (5,1) is close, (3,4) is close-ish, (3,3) is close. (5,1) is one step right and one down from us? Wait, we're at (4,2). (5,1) is right-down. So if we go RIGHT to (5,2), then next turn we can go DOWN to (5,1) to eat. That's good.\n\nBut also, going LEFT to (3,2) sets us up for (3,3) or (3,4). UP to (4,3) also gets us closer to (3,4).\n\nWe need to think about future safe moves after this move. Let's evaluate:\n\n1. **UP to (4,3)**: From there, possible next moves: up to (4,4), left to (3,3) (apple!), right to (5,3), down back to (4,2) (empty now). Good options.\n2. **DOWN to (4,1)**: Next moves: down to (4,0) (apple at (5,0) nearby though not directly), left to (3,1), right to (5,1) (apple!). Also good.\n3. **LEFT to (3,2)**: Next moves: left to (2,2), up to (3,3) (apple!), down to (3,1), right back to (4,2). Solid.\n4. **RIGHT to (5,2)**: Next moves: right to (6,2), up to (5,3), down to (5,1) (apple!), left back to (4,2).\n\nAll have at least 3 safe follow-ups except maybe DOWN only has 3 as well. Actually all have 3 or 4.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to **box the enemy in the top-right corner**. He's at (7,8). If we grow and control the center, we can slowly wall him off. But for now, we need to grow first.\n\nI think going **RIGHT** sets us up perfectly to snag (5,1) next turn, and also moves us slightly toward center-right. That's a good aggressive growth move.\n\nBut also, going **LEFT** toward (3,3) apple is good. Which is better? (5,1) is closer in steps: from (4,2) to (5,1) is 2 steps if we go RIGHT then DOWN. From (4,2) to (3,3) is 2 steps if we go LEFT then UP. Same distance.\n\nHowever, (5,1) is more isolated from enemy? Enemy is far away in top-right. Actually both are fine.\n\nI'm leaning RIGHT because it moves us toward the right side where there are more apples (6,3), (7,3), etc., and possibly toward cutting off enemy's descent.\n\nLet's lock it in.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After RIGHT to (5,2), go DOWN to (5,1) to eat apple, then assess enemy movement. Start building body to limit his space.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's get into it! Turn 1, we're at (5,2), enemy at (7,7). We just moved RIGHT last turn, so we're fresh on the board with no body yet. Let's scan our options!\n\nFirst, immediate danger check from (5,2):\n- **UP** to (5,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (5,1): Apple! But moving onto an apple is safe\u2014we just grow instantly. No body there.\n- **LEFT** to (4,2): Empty. That's where our head was last turn, but it's empty now because we moved. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,2): Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now\u2014no walls, no bodies anywhere. But we gotta think about the SIMULTANEOUS enemy move! He's at (7,7). Where's he likely to go? Closest apples to him: (7,6) DOWN, (9,9) RIGHT+UP, (6,3) LEFT+DOWN. He'll probably go for (7,6) DOWN, or maybe (9,9) RIGHT/UP.\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (7,6), he eats that apple. That's fine\u2014we're far apart. But we need to think about potential head-on collisions if our paths cross. From (7,7), his possible moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). Our possible moves from (5,2) don't intersect any of those directly this turn\u2014no same-cell risk.\n\nSo no immediate head-on risk. Good.\n\nNow, strategy: We want to GROW EARLY to get a length advantage and start controlling space. We have an apple at (5,1) DOWN from us\u2014that's a guaranteed eat if we go DOWN. That gives us +1 apple and our first body segment next turn.\n\nBut is it the BEST move long-term? Let's think about follow-up moves after each option:\n\n1. **DOWN to (5,1)**: Eat apple, grow to length 2. Next turn, our body will be at (5,2). From (5,1), possible moves: LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1), DOWN (5,0) (apple at (5,0) too!), UP back to (5,2) but that's our body next turn\u2014so UP would be suicide. So DOWN gives us 3 safe follow-ups after eating.\n\n2. **UP to (5,3)**: No apple. From there, next turn moves: UP (5,4), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3) (apple!), DOWN back to (5,2) (empty). All 4 safe. But we delay eating.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,2)**: No apple. From there, next turn: UP (4,3), LEFT (3,2), DOWN (4,1), RIGHT back to (5,2). All 4 safe. But again, no growth.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,2)**: No apple. Next turn: UP (6,3) (apple!), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1), LEFT back to (5,2). All 4 safe.\n\nSo DOWN gives us immediate growth, but reduces our future safe moves from 4 to 3 next turn (since UP becomes body). The others keep all options open but no growth.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE\u2014growth is power! Especially since enemy might eat an apple this turn too. If we both eat, we stay equal. If we eat and he doesn't, we get a length advantage early\u2014that's huge for forcing collisions later.\n\nAlso, eating the apple at (5,1) sets our body at (5,2), which starts building a wall. We can then maybe go DOWN again to (5,0) to eat another apple next turn, growing more.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (5,1), aim to eat (5,0) next, then push left or right to control the bottom row. Enemy is top-right\u2014we want to dominate the bottom and center, then slowly squeeze him.\n\nI think DOWN is the move\u2014secure the bag, grow the snake, assert dominance!\n\n**Plan for next turns**: After DOWN to (5,1) and eating, go for (5,0) next if safe, then assess enemy position. Start building a horizontal wall along bottom or left to limit his movement options. Watch his head\u2014if he's growing too, we might need to cut him off sooner.\n\nDOWN",

Let's scan!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK from (5,1):**\n- **UP** to (5,2): That's our own body! \u274c SUICIDE. Eliminated.\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): Apple! And it's empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo **UP is out**. Good start.\n\nNow, **SIMULTANEOUS MOVE RISK** \u2014 enemy head at (7,6). His possible moves:\n- UP to (7,7) \u2014 his own body! He probably won't do that unless he's throwing.\n- DOWN to (7,5) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT to (6,6) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (8,6) \u2014 empty.\n\nOur possible destinations: (5,0), (4,1), (6,1). None of those match his possible destinations. So **no direct head-on collision risk this turn**. Good.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\n\nWe just ate last turn, so we grew. We're length 2. Enemy is also length 2. We need to start building a length advantage to force a favorable collision.\n\nOption 1: **DOWN to (5,0)** \u2014 eat an apple! That grows us to length 3 next turn. Puts our body at (5,1). From (5,0) next turn, moves: LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0), UP (5,1) \u2014 but UP would be our body next turn, so that's suicide. So only 2 safe follow-ups. Risky? But we get the growth.\n\nOption 2: **LEFT to (4,1)** \u2014 no apple. Keeps us length 2. From (4,1) next turn, all 4 directions might be open? Let's check: UP (4,2) empty, DOWN (4,0) apple, LEFT (3,1) empty, RIGHT back to (5,1) empty. So 4 safe options next turn. More flexibility, but no growth.\n\nOption 3: **RIGHT to (6,1)** \u2014 no apple. Same logic: from (6,1), next turn UP (6,2) empty, DOWN (6,0) apple, RIGHT (7,1) empty, LEFT back to (5,1) empty. 4 safe options. Flexible, no growth.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to be aggressive! If we don't eat, enemy might eat and get ahead. Look at the board \u2014 apples at (5,0), (6,3), (3,3), etc. Enemy is at (7,6) \u2014 closest apple to him is maybe (6,3) or (3,6). He might go for (6,3) by moving LEFT then DOWN over a couple turns.\n\nIf we take DOWN now, we get length 3. That means next turn we can maybe cut off his path or threaten a head-on collision where we survive (since longer snake wins ties). Being longer also lets us start \"boxing\" him by using our body as a barrier.\n\nBut going DOWN reduces our next-turn options to 2. That's a bit scary. However, (5,0) is bottom row \u2014 we can then go LEFT or RIGHT along the bottom, maybe eat another apple there (lots on bottom row: (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0) are apples!). Bottom row is apple heaven! We could go RIGHT after eating (5,0) and munch along the bottom, growing huge while enemy is stuck top-right.\n\n**VERDICT:** Secure the bag! Take the apple, get length 3, then dominate the bottom row. We can always turn left or right along the bottom next turn. It's a bit riskier next turn, but the growth is worth it. Let's be AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After DOWN to (5,0) and eating, go RIGHT to (6,0) (apple) if safe, or LEFT to (4,0) (empty) to reposition. Start building a horizontal wall along y=0 with our body to trap enemy in the top half. Watch his head \u2014 if he comes down, we can meet him with a length advantage.\n\nDOWN",

The board\u2019s apple stash is screaming along the x=3 column\u2014(3,2), (3,6), (3,8)\u2014and even a lonely (0,4) down left. Our tail stretches from (3,3) to (7,3), so moving DOWN would step on our own body \u2192 instant KO. LEFT, RIGHT, and UP are all clear of our own segments.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 But we can\u2019t ignore the rival\u2019s next move. He\u2019s stuck at y=1 and can only go to (5,2), (5,0), (4,1) or (6,1). None of those intersect (2,4), (4,4) or (3,5). So all three directions are safe from a head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Which step brings us closer to the biggest apple bounty? UP lands us at (3,5)\u2014right under the dense cluster of apples at (3,6) and (3,8). One more UP next turn would let us gobble (3,6), close the 1\u2011apple gap, and keep the growth momentum rolling. LEFT or RIGHT just shuffles us sideways and keeps us trapped in the low\u2011y zone where the rival is prowling.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Do we want flexibility? Moving UP leaves us with three viable exits next turn: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would hit our new body). That\u2019s a solid \u201ckeep options open\u201d play.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term vision: dominate the x=3 column, harvest (3,6) then (3,8), out\u2011grow the rival, and force him into a corner where a head\u2011on collision becomes unavoidable.

Enemy head at (3,4), body going east.\n\nFirst, check all four moves for INSTANT DEATH:\n\n- **UP** to (5,2): That's empty. \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): That's occupied by our own tail segment at (6,0)? Wait, check: Our body is [(6,1),(7,1),(8,1),(8,0),(7,0),(6,0)]. (5,0) is free on board? Board shows at (5,0) is '.' in row 0 column 5. Actually row 0: \"A . . . . . T T T A\" at columns 0-9. So column 5 is '.' between A at col0 and T at col6. So (5,0) is safe. \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): That's empty. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): That's our own body segment (6,1) \u2014 that's DEATH. \u274c So RIGHT is out.\n\nAll but RIGHT are safe from immediate self-crash.\n\nNow, check opponent's possible moves: Their head at (3,4). They could go UP to (3,5), DOWN to (3,3) (their own body), LEFT to (2,4), RIGHT to (4,4).\n\nWe need to think about simultaneous movement \u2014 could we collide heads?\n\nIf we go UP to (5,2), could enemy move into (5,2)? They'd need to go from (3,4) to (5,2) in one move \u2014 impossible. So no head-on risk.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,0), enemy can't reach (5,0) in one move from (3,4). Safe.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,1), enemy can't reach (4,1) in one move.\n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nNow strategy: We want to box him in. He's up top around row 4, we're at bottom row 1. We have length advantage. We should move to cut off his escape downwards.\n\nLook at the board: He's near apples at (3,6), (1,5), (2,8). If he goes for apples, he'll likely move UP/LEFT. We should move to control the center and left side.\n\nLEFT to (4,1) keeps us near bottom left, but maybe not aggressive enough.\n\nUP to (5,2) moves us closer to him, threatening to cut off his path down.\n\nDOWN to (5,0) moves us away from him \u2014 not good for pressure.\n\nWe want to be aggressive with length advantage. UP seems best \u2014 it gets us closer to enemy, sets up to intercept him if he moves down for apples (0,4) etc.\n\nAlso, check future safe moves from each:\n\nFrom (5,2):\n- Next turn possible moves: UP to (5,3) \u2014 that's enemy body (T at col3 row3? Actually (5,3) is enemy body? Enemy body: (3,3),(4,3),(5,3)... YES (5,3) is enemy body \u2014 so UP next turn would be deadly unless enemy moves away. But we can decide later.\n- LEFT to (4,2) free, RIGHT to (6,2) free, DOWN to (5,1) is our old head position but will be empty next turn (since we move). So from (5,2), 3 safe moves likely.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n- UP (4,2) free, DOWN (4,0) free, LEFT (3,1) free, RIGHT back to (5,1) empty next turn \u2014 all 4 safe.\n\nFrom (5,0):\n- UP to (5,1) empty, LEFT (4,0) free, RIGHT (6,0) our body \u2014 so 2 safe.\n\nSo UP gives 3 safe next moves, LEFT gives 4 safe, DOWN gives 2 safe.\n\nBut UP advances position toward enemy. I think we go UP \u2014 start moving to cut him off. We can steer left next turn if needed.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move upward toward row 3-4 to block enemy's descent. Use our length to create a barrier. Force him toward top edge or into our body. If he runs, chase and trap.\n\n**UP**",

Going RIGHT moves us toward our own body and right side \u2014 maybe less aggressive.\n\nCheck future safe moves from each:\n\nFrom (4,2) if LEFT:\n- Next turn moves: UP (4,3) \u2014 enemy body (T at col4 row3) \u274c, DOWN (4,1) \u2014 free \u2705, LEFT (3,2) \u2014 free \u2705, RIGHT back to (5,2) \u2014 free \u2705. So 3 safe moves.\n\nFrom (6,2) if RIGHT:\n- Next turn: UP (6,3) \u2014 enemy body (T at col6 row3) \u274c, DOWN (6,1) \u2014 our body (but will be empty next turn? Our body moves, so (6,1) becomes free after we move) \u2705, LEFT back to (5,2) \u2705, RIGHT (7,2) free \u2705. So 3 safe moves.\n\nBoth give 3 safe next moves.\n\nBut we need to think about trapping enemy. Enemy is at (3,5). If we go LEFT to (4,2), we're positioning to move up left side and maybe cut him off from going down toward apples at (0,4),(1,5). If we go RIGHT to (6,2), we're moving toward our own tail and right wall \u2014 less threatening.\n\nAlso, apples: closest apples to us: (3,2) is close to (4,2) if we go LEFT. That's a potential grow opportunity.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move to (4,2), then maybe UP to (4,3) next turn? But (4,3) is enemy body now \u2014 but if enemy moves away, it could be free. We can instead go LEFT to (3,2) to grab apple at (3,2) and block enemy's leftward escape. Use our length to create a wall along column 3 or 4, force enemy toward top edge.\n\nI think LEFT is more aggressive toward controlling the board center-left.\n\nLET'S GO LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT and RIGHT are empty squares, but they don't push us any closer to the sweet apple column at x=3. UP moves us to (3,7), which is still empty now but puts us directly under the big (3,8) apple and keeps the whole x=3 corridor open for future grabs.  \n\n**Future\u2011proofing** \u2013 After an UP move we still have three viable exits next turn: UP (straight to (3,8) apple), LEFT, or RIGHT. That\u2019s a solid \u201ckeep options open\u201d vibe. DOWN would trap us in our own body, so we avoid it like the plague.  \n\n**Opponent radar** \u2013 Their head at (4,2) can only hop to (4,3), (4,1), (3,2) or (5,2) this turn. None of those intersect our planned next positions, so no imminent head\u2011on KO risk.  \n\n**Apple race** \u2013 Even though we don\u2019t snag an apple this very turn, we\u2019re positioning ourselves to claim (3,8) next move and push our total toward that 30\u2011apple victory faster than shuffling sideways.  \n\n**Bottom line** \u2013 The only move that simultaneously *keeps us alive*, *stretches us toward a high\u2011value apple*, and *maintains multiple safe exits* is **UP**.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f QUICK PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:  \n- Move UP to (3,7) \u2192 grab (3,8) ASAP.  \n- Keep LEFT/RIGHT ready as escape routes.  \n- Watch the rival\u2019s trail; force a collision if we outgrow them.  \n\nUP",

BUT (1,7) IS CURRENTLY HIS BODY \u2014 WILL IT CLEAR? HE'S MOVING, SO HIS TAIL AT (3,5) MIGHT MOVE IF HE DOESN'T EAT. HE DIDN'T EAT LAST TURN, SO HIS TAIL SHOULD MOVE, FREEING (3,5). BUT (1,7) IS PART OF HIS BODY LOOP \u2014 MAY NOT CLEAR YET. RISKY.  \n- FROM (2,7) WE ALSO HAVE OPTIONS UP/DOWN/RIGHT LATER.\n\n**RIGHT TO (3,6):**  \n- MOVES US AWAY FROM HIM HORIZONTALLY.  \n- GIVES US MORE SPACE BUT LESS PRESSURE.  \n- FROM (3,6) WE COULD GO UP TO (3,7) OR RIGHT TO (4,6) TO ENCIRCLE.\n\nWE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 WE SHOULD PRESS THE ATTACK! FORCE HIM INTO THE CORNER!  \nGOING UP POSITIONS US TO CUT OFF HIS RIGHT ESCAPE NEXT TURN. IF WE GO RIGHT, WE YIELD SPACE AND LET HIM BREAK OUT ALONG THE TOP WALL.  \nWE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! UP IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO MY FUTURE SELF:  \nHE'S AT (0,7) \u2192 LIKELY GOING UP TO (0,8).  \nWE GO UP TO (2,7).  \nNEXT TURN, IF (1,7) BECOMES FREE (HIS TAIL MOVES), MOVE LEFT TO (1,7) TO BLOCK HIS RIGHT ESCAPE!  \nIF (1,7) STILL OCCUPIED, GO UP TO (2,8) OR RIGHT TO (3,7) TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE.  \nGOAL: DRIVE HIM INTO TOP-LEFT CORNER (0,9) AND FORCE A CRASH INTO WALL OR OUR BODY!  \nDON'T LET HIM SLIP RIGHT! WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 FORCE HEAD-ON IF POSSIBLE!  \nIGNORE APPLES \u2014 FOCUS ON TRAPPING HIM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",
