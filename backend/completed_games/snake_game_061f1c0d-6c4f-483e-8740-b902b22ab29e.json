Stay open/avoid getting boxed in by my own snake.\n\n**Next Moves Forecast:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (6, 2).\n- Next: If safe, can continue DOWN to (6, 1) and eat apple.\n- Possible alternate: at any moment, can go RIGHT to pursue (7, 2) if situation changes or path to (6, 1) is not available (if enemy becomes a threat on lower side, which is currently very unlikely).\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \nDOWN\n\n---\n\n**Note to Self Next Turn:**  \n- If not blocked, continue DOWN for apple (6, 1).  \n- Beware of my own growing body.  \n- As soon as (6, 1) is eaten, look for next-closest apple, possibly (7, 2) or (4, 3), depending on spawn changes.  \n- Stay open and avoid dead-ends as you grow; only backtrack if absolutely safe.\n\n**Move:** DOWN"

Let's check\u2014\n    - Not my body.\n    - Not enemy.\n    - No apple (apple at (8, 0)), so just empty.\n- **SAFE**\n\n#### LEFT: (5, 1)\n- In bounds.\n- Not my body. Not enemy.  \n- **SAFE**\n\n#### RIGHT: (7, 1)\n- In bounds.\n- Not my body.
