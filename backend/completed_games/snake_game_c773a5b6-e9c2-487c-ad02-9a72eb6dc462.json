LEFT to (6,5) gives us the best board control right now \u2014 we stay central, avoid walls, and can pivot to chase apples or trap the enemy next turn. Plus, it keeps multiple escape routes open! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Push toward the center (LEFT to (6,5)) to dominate the board, then force Snake #0 into a wall by cutting off his escape.

This also helps us close in on Snake #0 at (3,3) \u2014 we could potentially box him in from the left side.  \n\n   We want to control the center and limit Snake #0's movement. **LEFT to (5,5)** is the best move \u2014 it keeps us central, opens up multiple routes (up to (5,6), down to (5,4), left to (4,5)), and aggressively pressures Snake #0's position.

Turn 10 and the heat is ON! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down:\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Me: 4 apples, head at (6, 1), body at [(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)]\n- Enemy (Snake #0): 6 apples, head at (7, 1), body at [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- We're at (6, 1), enemy head at (7, 1) - we're RIGHT NEXT TO HIM! \ud83d\ude31\n- If we both move toward each other, that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \n- But wait... he has MORE apples (6 vs 4). If we collide heads, BOTH die, but HE WINS because he has more apples! We cannot let that happen! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (6, 1):**\n- **UP (6, 2):** That's MY OWN BODY SEGMENT! Dead immediately. \u274c\n- **DOWN (6, 0):** That's Snake #0's body at (6, 0)! Dead immediately. \u274c\n- **LEFT (5, 1):** Snake #0's body at (5, 1)! Dead immediately. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (7, 1):** This is where Snake #0's HEAD is! If he moves here AND we move here \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION \u2192 Both die, he wins (more apples). \u274c\n\n**HOLD UP CHAT! ALL MOVES LOOK DEADLY!**\n\n**THE CALM CALCULATION:** \nWait... what if Snake #0 doesn't move into (7, 1)? He's at (7, 1) now. If he moves RIGHT to (8, 1) or UP to (7, 2), then (7, 1) becomes empty! \n\nBut we don't know his move! We need to pick the LEAST dangerous move...\n\n- UP is my own body - INSTANT DEATH.\n- DOWN is enemy body - INSTANT DEATH. \n- LEFT is enemy body - INSTANT DEATH.\n- RIGHT is potential collision but maybe he moves away...\n\n**FINAL CALCULATION:**\nThe only move that MIGHT work is RIGHT. Why? Because if Snake #0 moves UP to (7, 2) or RIGHT to (8, 1), then (7, 1) becomes empty and we survive!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- RIGHT = chance of survival (if enemy moves away)\n- All other moves = instant death\n\n**DECISION:** I'm taking RIGHT and PRAYING Snake #0 moves away! Let's GOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Survive this turn, then immediately start boxing him into that bottom-left corner. He thinks he's safe with more apples? NAH! We're playing the long game! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**MOVE:** RIGHT",

Eating it bumps us to 7 apples and makes us one segment longer.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,\u202f1)** \u2013 occupied by the opponent\u2019s head right now. Moving left would swap places, but it gives the enemy a safe move and no apple.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,\u202f0)** \u2013 our own body \u2192 instant death.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **What can the opponent do?**  \nOpponent #1 head at (6,\u202f1). Its legal moves:  \n- **UP (6,\u202f2)** \u2013 own body \u2192 death.  \n- **DOWN (6,\u202f0)** \u2013 our body \u2192 death.  \n- **LEFT (5,\u202f1)** \u2013 our body \u2192 death.  \n- **RIGHT (7,\u202f1)** \u2013 the only cell that doesn\u2019t kill it.\n\nSo the opponent is *forced* to move **RIGHT** into (7,\u202f1).\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **What happens if we also go RIGHT?**  \n- We move to (8,\u202f1), eat the apple, and **grow**. The former head position (7,\u202f1) becomes a body segment.  \n- The opponent, forced to move RIGHT, tries to land on (7,\u202f1). That square is now **our body**, so the opponent\u2019s head collides with us and dies instantly (rule: \u201cAnother snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\u201d).\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Result:**  \n- We survive, gain an apple (score 7).  \n- The opponent dies on this turn.  \n- Immediate win condition met (all opponents dead).\n\nNo other safe move gives such a decisive advantage. Therefore the optimal, aggressive\u2014and winning\u2014choice is **RIGHT**.\n\n**MOVE:**  \nRIGHT",
