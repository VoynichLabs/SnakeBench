This is a good option, as it's relatively close and doesn't immediately put me in danger.\n* (4, 6): Moving up would take me to (4, 2).  This is another decent option and isn't too far.\n* (9, 8): Moving up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up would take me to (9, 8). This is too far and dangerous.\n* (9, 2): Moving up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up would take me to (9, 2). This is also too far and dangerous.\n* (6, 3): Moving right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right would take me to (6, 3). This is also quite far.\n\nThe closest and safest apple to go for is (5,0) by moving right.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue eating apples and avoiding Snake 0. Small, calculated movements are best.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",
