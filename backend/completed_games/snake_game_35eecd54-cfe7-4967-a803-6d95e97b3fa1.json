From (3, 8), I could move RIGHT to (4, 8) and collect it next turn. This seems like the most efficient path to the nearest apple.\n\nDOWN to (3, 6): This starts me toward the apple at (3, 3), but it's 4 moves away.\n\nRIGHT to (4, 7): This is safe and gets me closer to the apple at (4, 8), but I'd need to go UP next turn anyway.\n\nThe enemy snake at (9, 0) is still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy: Move UP to (3, 8), then next turn move RIGHT to (4, 8) to collect that apple. After that, I can reassess and potentially go for the apple at (1, 8) or head down toward (3, 3).\n\nUP",

My main focus should be on collecting the apples to grow my own snake.\n\nNext turn, I'll try to navigate towards the other apples on the board, while avoiding the walls and the enemy snake.
