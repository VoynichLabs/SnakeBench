The enemy snake is currently diagonally above us, headed towards the bottom left. Our current position is at (7, 3).\n\n### Observations:\n\n- The closest apple to our position is (3, 6). However, moving right directly might make us vulnerable to enemy Snake #0, which is approaching that general area.\n- Another tempting option is the apple at (0, 2). It's slightly safer due to its position relative to the enemy's current movement, but it's farther.\n\n**Strategy Thoughts:**\n\n- Our primary goal is to avoid Snake #0 and collect apples effectively.\n- Moving toward the (3, 6) apple is viable, but it may expose us to danger.\n- A safer option might be a slower approach toward (0, 2), while monitoring Snake #0's moves.\n\n**Decided Move:**\nI\u2019ll move **UP** to (7, 4).

This is a good move as it will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow. Since both DOWN and RIGHT are viable options, we can choose either one.
