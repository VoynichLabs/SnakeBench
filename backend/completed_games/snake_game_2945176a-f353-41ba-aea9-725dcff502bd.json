I was at (4, 9) and I moved up, so my current position is (4, 8).\n\nNow, I need to move up again to reach the apple at (7, 4). I can do that.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to continue moving up and try to reach the apple at (7, 4). If I succeed, I'll gain a point and grow.\n\nNext move: UP."

Since our last move was DOWN, which maintained a diagonal direction towards the apple, we can now move RIGHT to maintain the diagonal movement. This move will bring us closer to the apple and keep a safe distance from Snake #1. Strategy for this turn: prioritize safety and progress towards the closest apple. Your decided next move: RIGHT."
