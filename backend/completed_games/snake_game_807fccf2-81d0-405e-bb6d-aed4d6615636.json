Moving up or down won't help me collect any apples. Moving left would take me closer to the apple at (1, 8), but it's risky because I'm already close to the edge of the board. Moving right would take me closer to the apples at (5, 6) and (7, 4), but I'm also closer to the enemy snake at (4, 7).\n\nGiven the current situation, I think it's best to avoid taking risks and stick to a safer strategy.
