Avoid collisions with walls, other snakes, and myself.\n2. Collect as many apples as possible to gain points.\n3. Try to position myself in a way that allows me to block enemy snakes or collect more apples in the future.\n\nGiven the current board state, I see four apples. One of them is at my current position (1, 1), which I can collect if I don't move. However, I'd like to avoid staying still as it might make me an easy target for enemy snakes.\n\nThe apple at (2, 1) is within reach if I move right. But moving right would expose me to the enemy snake #1 at (8, 5), which is closer to my current position than the apple. So, I'd rather avoid moving towards it.\n\nThe apple at (0, 1) is also within reach if I move left. This move would put me closer to the apple at (5, 8) and the apple at (9, 5), which are further away if I move right. So, I decide to move left (to position (0, 1)).\n\nNext move: LEFT."

This move would put me closer to the apple at (5, 8) and the apple at (9, 5), which are further away if I move right.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the enemy snake #1 at (8, 5). If it moves towards me, I might be in danger.
