Empty cell.\n\nSo I have two safe moves: UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing paths to apples:**\n\nClosest apples to me:\n- (5, 2): Distance ~5 moves - going RIGHT then UP\n- (7, 2): Distance ~7 moves - same general direction\n- (0, 4): Distance ~6 moves - would need to go LEFT (blocked) or UP first\n- (2, 7): Distance ~7 moves - directly UP from current x position\n\n**If I go UP to (2, 1):**\n- Next options: UP (2, 2), LEFT (1, 1), RIGHT (3, 1)\n- This positions me to go toward (5, 2) via diagonal approach\n- Also keeps option to go up toward (2, 7) eventually\n\n**If I go RIGHT to (3, 0):**\n- Next options: UP (3, 1), RIGHT (4, 0), LEFT (2, 0) - will be tail, empty\n- Continue along bottom toward (5, 2) and (7, 2)\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\n- Snake #1 at (4, 5) - looks like it grabbed the apple that was at (4, 5) since it has 3 apples now\n- Enemy might go toward (5, 2) or (2, 7) next\n- Distance from enemy to (5, 2): about 4 moves (4,5) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (5,2)\n- Actually enemy body blocks some paths, but they could reach (5, 2) in ~4 moves\n\nI should race toward (5, 2). Going UP now to (2, 1) then continuing UP to (2, 2), then RIGHT toward (5, 2) seems like a good path.\n\nAlternatively, going RIGHT to (3, 0), then (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2) is 5 moves.\nGoing UP to (2, 1), then (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2) is also 5 moves.\n\nBoth routes are similar. UP gives me slightly more maneuverability and keeps me away from the corner.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. UP now to (2, 1)\n2. Continue toward (5, 2): RIGHT to (3, 1), RIGHT to (4, 1), RIGHT to (5, 1), UP to (5, 2)\n3. Then head to (7, 2)\n\nUP",

T T . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nSo my head is at (7, 2), marked as \"0\".\nMy body is at (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1) - these are marked as \"T\".\n\nThe apple at (6, 3) is interesting - it's just above my body segment at (6, 2).\nThe apple at (4, 3) is also close.\n\n**Best path to apples:**\n- If I go UP to (7, 3), I'm one step closer to the upper right apples (9, 7) and (8, 9)\n- From (7, 3), I could then go RIGHT to (8, 3), then work my way up\n- Alternatively, from (7, 3) I could go LEFT to (6, 3) and collect that apple!\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully:\n- If I go UP to (7, 3), next turn I could go LEFT to (6, 3) to collect an apple!\n- That's a 2-move path to an apple.\n\nOr:\n- If I go RIGHT to (8, 2), I'm getting closer to the right side\n- From (8, 2) I could go UP toward (9, 7) or (8, 9)\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\n- Snake #1 at (2, 8) - in upper left area\n- Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n- The enemy might go for apple at (0, 4) or maybe (8, 9) or (9, 7)\n- They could also be interested in collecting more apples in the upper area\n\nThe enemy is far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Evaluating directions:**\n1. **UP to (7, 3)**: Gets me closer to (6, 3) apple. Next turn I could go LEFT to (6, 3). Also keeps me moving toward upper right apples.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (8, 2)**: Gets me closer to the right edge. From here I could go UP and eventually reach (9, 7) or (8, 9).\n\n3. **DOWN to (7, 1)**: Moves away from most apples. Not a good choice.\n\nI think UP is the best choice because:\n1. It positions me to collect the apple at (6, 3) in just one more move\n2. It also keeps me heading toward the upper area where (9, 7) and (8, 9) are located\n3. It doesn't trap me\n\nLet me verify (7, 3) is safe:\n- Not off the board \u2713\n- Not my own body \u2713\n- Not enemy body \u2713\n\nAfter going UP to (7, 3):\nMy body will become: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)] - tail at (4, 1) disappears since I didn't eat an apple last turn... wait, I DID eat an apple last turn at (7, 2)!\n\nLet me reconsider. If I ate an apple on the last turn, my body grows by 1. So my current body is:\n- Head at (7, 2)\n- Body at [(6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]\n\nThis is 5 segments total (head + 4 body), which matches having 4 apples (started with 1 segment).\n\nActually wait, the problem says I've collected 4 apples. With 4 apples, my snake should be 1 + 4 = 5 segments. I count:\n1. Head at (7, 2)\n2. (6, 2)\n3. (5, 2)\n4. (5, 1)\n5. (4, 1)\n\nYes, 5 segments. This matches.\n\nSo if I move UP to (7, 3):\n- My new head is at (7, 3)\n- Body becomes: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)] - the tail at (4, 1) disappears\n- Total: 5 segments still\n\nFrom (7, 3), on the next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (7, 4): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2): My body! DEATH\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3): Apple! Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3): Safe\n\nSo if I go UP now, next turn I can go LEFT to collect the apple at (6, 3)!\n\nThis seems like a good plan. Let me also consider the RIGHT move:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2):\n- My new head is at (8, 2)\n- Body becomes: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n\nFrom (8, 2), on the next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (8, 3): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 1): Safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 2): My body! DEATH\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2): Safe\n\nThis doesn't immediately lead to an apple.\n\nI think UP is the better choice because it sets up for collecting (6, 3) next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. UP now to (7, 3)\n2. LEFT to (6, 3) - collect apple! (will have 5 apples)\n3. Then consider going UP toward (9, 7) and (8, 9)\n4. Could go to (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7) to get that apple\n\nActually, let me double-check if there's any risk from the enemy. Enemy head at (2, 8). Enemy could move:\n- UP to (2, 9)\n- DOWN to (2, 7) - that's their body, so DEATH for them\n- LEFT to (1, 8) - that's their body, so DEATH for them\n- RIGHT to (3, 8)\n\nSo the enemy will likely go UP to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 8). Neither threatens me at (7, 3).\n\nFinal decision: UP\n\nUP\n</thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (7, 2), Body at [(6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]\n**Apples:** (9, 7), (0, 4), (8, 9), (4, 3), (6, 3)\n**Enemy:** Snake #1 - Head at (2, 8), far away in upper left\n\n**Evaluating moves from (7, 2):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7, 3): Safe! Empty cell.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 1): Safe! Empty cell.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 2): **DEATH** - This is my own body!\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 2): Safe! Empty cell.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- (6, 3): Just 1 up + 1 left = 2 moves away! But I can't go LEFT now (body). If I go UP first to (7, 3), then next turn I can go LEFT to (6, 3) to collect it!\n- (4, 3): Need to navigate around my body\n- (9, 7) and (8, 9): Upper right area, several moves away\n\n**Best move evaluation:**\n- **UP to (7, 3)**: This is strategic! From (7, 3), next turn I can:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) = APPLE! \n  - UP \u2192 (7, 4) = Safe\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) = Safe\n  \n- **RIGHT to (8, 2)**: Moves toward right edge but no immediate apple path\n- **DOWN to (7, 1)**: Moves away from apples\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (2, 8) is very far away. They can only go UP or RIGHT (other directions hit their body). No collision threat.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. UP now to (7, 3)\n2. LEFT to (6, 3) - collect apple! (will have 5 apples)\n3. Then head UP toward (9, 7) and (8, 9) in upper right\n\nUP",

As I planned last turn, I should be able to go LEFT to (6, 3) to collect an apple!\n\n**Evaluating moves from (7, 3):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7, 4): Safe! Empty cell.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 2): **DEATH** - This is my own body!\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 3): Safe! There's an apple here! \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 3): Safe! Empty cell.\n\nSo my safe moves are: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- (6, 3): Right next to me! Going LEFT will get it.\n- (4, 3): Also on y=3, but 3 cells left of me\n- (9, 7): Upper right, 2 right + 4 up = 6 moves\n- (8, 9): Upper right, 1 right + 6 up = 7 moves\n- (0, 4): Far left, 7 left + 1 up = 8 moves\n\n**Best move:**\nLEFT to (6, 3) gets me an apple immediately! This is exactly what I planned.\n\nLet me verify (6, 3) is safe:\n- Not off the board \u2713\n- Not my own body: My body is at (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1) - (6, 3) is not in this list \u2713\n- Not enemy body: Enemy body at (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7) - (6, 3) is not in this list \u2713\n\n**Enemy movement analysis:**\nEnemy head at (3, 8). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3, 9): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 7): Safe (not their body)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 8): Their own body! DEATH\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8): Safe\n\nWait, let me look at the board again:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . A .\n 8 . T T 1 . . . . . .\n 7 . T T . . . . . . A\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 A . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . A . A 0 . .\n 2 . . . . . T T T . .\n 1 . . . . .

They'll probably go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nNone of these moves threaten me at (6, 3).\n\n**After collecting the apple at (6, 3):**\n- I'll have 5 apples\n- My body will be: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)] - 6 segments\n\nFrom (6, 3), next turn options:\n- UP \u2192 (6, 4): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 2): My body! DEATH\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 3): Safe, and leads toward apple at (4, 3)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 3): My body! DEATH\n\nSo after eating at (6, 3), I'll have UP or LEFT as options. LEFT leads to (5, 3), and from there I could go LEFT again to (4, 3) to get another apple!\n\n**Plan:**\n1. LEFT now to (6, 3) - collect apple! (5 apples)\n2. LEFT to (5, 3) \n3. LEFT to (4, 3) - collect apple! (6 apples)\n4. Then I need to be careful about my body. After (4, 3), I might need to go UP or DOWN to avoid trapping myself.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. After eating at (6, 3), my body will extend. Let me trace:\n\nCurrent body: Head (7, 3), Body [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (6, 3) and eating apple:\n- Head at (6, 3)\n- Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)] - 6 segments total (grew by 1)\n\nFrom (6, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (6, 4): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 2): Body! DEATH\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 3): Safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 3): Body! DEATH\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 3):\n- Head at (5, 3)\n- Body: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)] - tail (5, 1) moves\n\nFrom (5, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (5, 4): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 2): Body! DEATH\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 3): Apple! Safe!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3): Body! DEATH\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 3) and eat apple:\n- Head at (4, 3)\n- Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)] - grew by 1, 7 segments\n\nFrom (4, 3):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 4): Safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 2): Safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 3): Safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 3): Body! DEATH\n\nGreat, I'll have plenty of options after collecting both apples!\n\n**Final decision: LEFT to collect the apple at (6, 3)**\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. LEFT now to (6, 3) - collect apple! (5 apples)\n2. LEFT to (5, 3)\n3. LEFT to (4, 3) - collect apple! (6 apples)\n4. Then assess - could go UP toward the upper right apples or continue exploring\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position at (7, 3):\n\n**Evaluating moves:**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7, 4): Safe, empty cell\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 2): **DEATH** - my own body!\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 3): Safe + APPLE! \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 3): Safe, empty cell\n\n**Apple at (6, 3):**\nThis is exactly what I planned last turn! Going LEFT immediately collects an apple.\n\n**Verifying (6, 3) is safe:**\n- Not off board \u2713\n- Not my body (my body is at 7,2 / 6,2 / 5,2 / 5,1) \u2713\n- Not enemy body (enemy at 2,8 / 1,8 / 1,7 / 2,7) \u2713\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (3, 8) is far away. They can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT hits their body). No collision risk with me.\n\n**Planning ahead from (6, 3):**\nAfter collecting the apple, I'll have options:\n- LEFT to (5, 3) \u2192 then LEFT to (4, 3) for another apple!\n- UP to (6, 4) keeps path open\n\nThis sets up a nice chain where I can collect (6, 3) now, then work toward (4, 3) next!\n\n**Strategy note for future turns:**\n1. After (6, 3), go LEFT to (5, 3)\n2. Then LEFT to (4, 3) to collect another apple (will have 6 apples)\n3. After that, head UP toward (9, 7) and (8, 9) in upper right\n4. Watch body length - avoid boxing myself in\n\nLEFT",
