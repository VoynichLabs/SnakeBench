If he moves UP he goes to (3, 1). If he moves RIGHT he goes to (4, 0). He might go for the apple at (4, 1) or (2, 4) eventually, but right now he's far from me.\n\n**Apples nearby:** Closest apple is (2, 4) \u2014 two moves away if I go UP then RIGHT. Also (6, 2) is farther right.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nWe want to **box him in early** while we're same length. Right now, he's in the bottom row. If I move toward the center, I can start controlling space. But also, I want to **grow first** so I have a length advantage for head-on collisions later.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I'm closer to center, closer to apple (2, 4), and also closer to cutting off his upward movement from (3, 0). If I go UP to (1, 3), I'm moving away from him but toward top apples \u2014 maybe less aggressive.\n\n**Best move here:** Go RIGHT toward center control and the apple path. That also sets me up to possibly trap him against the left wall if he stays low.\n\n**Future self note:** After this move, watch his move. If he goes UP to (3, 1), consider moving UP to (2, 3) to get between him and the apple at (2, 4). Force him toward walls. Grow when safe, then aim to cut off his escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now \u2014 no bodies in any of those cells.\n\n**Enemy positioning:** He's at (1, 0). He can go UP to (1, 1), LEFT to (0, 0), or RIGHT to (2, 0). DOWN is off board.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 2) and he goes RIGHT to (2, 0)\u2026 no, that's two apart.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 3) and he goes UP to (1, 1)\u2026 no.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 3) and he goes\u2026 nowhere near.  \nSo no immediate head-on collision possible this turn. Good.\n\n**Long-term aggression plan:**  \nWe want to trap him against the bottom wall. He's at y=0. If we move down now, we get closer to him but risk boxing ourselves in later? Let's think.\n\nIf we take the apple at (2, 4), we grow to length 2. That means next turn our tail will be at (2, 3). That gives us more body to block with later. Growing early = more board control.\n\nBut also, moving UP toward the center gives more options. From (2, 4), we can go left, right, or up next turn \u2014 lots of freedom.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 2) puts us closer to him, but we're still length 1 \u2014 can't block him effectively yet. And we leave apples on the board for him to potentially get.\n\n**Best move?** UP to (2, 4) \u2014 eat the apple, grow to length 2, gain a point lead, and stay central. From there, we can start descending to cut off his access to the upper board. He's stuck at the bottom \u2014 if we grow and then move down, we can wall him off.\n\n**Future self note:** After eating, our body will be [(2,4), (2,3)]. Next turn, avoid moving back into (2, 3) \u2014 that's our own tail. Watch where enemy goes. If he moves up, we can consider moving left/right to get above him and limit his space.

Enemy snake: Head at (1,1), no body, length 1.\n\nFirst, check immediate death moves:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 That's our OWN TAIL! \ud83d\ude31 If we go down, we crash into ourselves. ELIMINATE!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate self-crash. Also check enemy body? He has none, so no threat there.\n\nNow, consider enemy's possible moves from (1,1):\nHe can go UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), LEFT to (0,1), RIGHT to (2,1).\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \nIf we go LEFT to (1,4) and he goes... nowhere near.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (3,4) and he goes... no.  \nIf we go UP to (2,5) and he goes... no.  \nSo no possible head-on collision this turn. Good.\n\n**But wait \u2014 what about NEXT turn?**  \nWe need to think about cutting off his space. He's at (1,1), we're at (2,4). We have a length advantage (2 vs 1). We can be AGGRESSIVE! If we move toward him, we can start boxing him against the bottom-left wall.\n\n**Apple consideration:** There's an apple at (4,5) \u2014 two steps right, one up from us. But we said don't focus on apples... but growing helps us dominate. However, moving toward apples might take us away from trapping him.\n\n**Long-term plan:** He's short, we're longer. If we can force a head-on collision while we have higher score, WE WIN. So maybe we move to get above him or beside him to limit his moves.\n\nLet's evaluate each safe move:\n\n- **UP to (2,5)**: Moves us away from him, more central. Keeps options open but doesn't pressure him. From there we could go left/right/down next turn.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: Puts us directly above him (same x column). He's at (1,1). If he goes up, we could go down next turn to meet him. This starts vertical compression.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Moves us away horizontally, gives him more room.\n\n**Best aggressive move?** LEFT to (1,4). Why? It aligns us above him, limiting his eastward expansion. Next turn, if he goes up to (1,2), we can go down to (1,3) \u2014 now we're one above him, and our body is at (1,4) and (2,4). He'd have to avoid us. We can keep descending, forcing him toward the bottom wall or into a bad collision.\n\nAlso, from (1,4), our safe moves next turn would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would be into our future tail at (2,4)? Wait, next turn our body will be [(new head), (2,4)] and tail at (2,3) if we don't eat an apple. So DOWN to (1,3) would be safe unless our tail moves? Actually, tail stays at (2,3) unless we eat. So yes, DOWN would be safe next turn.\n\n**Future self note:** After moving LEFT to (1,4), body becomes [(1,4), (2,4)], tail at (2,3). Watch enemy's move. If he goes UP to (1,2), consider going DOWN to (1,3) next turn to pressure. If he goes LEFT/DOWN, we can shift left/down to cut off. Goal: force him into a corner or head-on collision while we're longer.\n\nLEFT",

Actually, if both die, the snake with more apples wins. We have 1, he has 0. So we'd win the round! That's a GOOD trade for us! \ud83d\udcaa\n- If we go LEFT to (0,4) \u2014 no.\n\nSo DOWN could force a head-on if he chooses UP. But he might not. Is it worth the risk? We have length advantage, we could win the collision. But if he doesn't go UP, we just move closer to him.\n\n**Step 3: Think about trapping him.**\n\nHe's at (1,2). We're at (1,4). If we go DOWN to (1,3), we're directly above him. That puts massive pressure! He can't go UP without colliding with us (unless we move away). Next turn, if we stay at (1,3) and he goes UP to (1,3)? That's a head-on again \u2014 but we'd have moved, so maybe not.\n\nActually, if we go DOWN to (1,3) this turn, and he goes UP to (1,3), we both die this turn \u2014 we win because we have more apples. That's a WIN condition! If he avoids UP, he's forced left, down, or right. We can keep chasing.\n\n**Step 4: Check other moves.**\n\nUP to (1,5): Moves us away, gives him room. Not aggressive.\nLEFT to (0,4): Puts us to his left side, could cut off his leftward escape. Also safe.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe want to box him against the bottom-left wall. He's at (1,2). The wall is at x=0 and y=0. If we go DOWN to (1,3), we're above him. Next turn, we could go LEFT to (0,3) to block his left, or DOWN to (1,2) if he moves down? Wait, if he goes DOWN to (1,1), we could go DOWN to (1,2) to stay above him.\n\nActually, going DOWN seems most aggressive. Forces him to react. If he goes UP, we win by head-on. If he goes elsewhere, we can keep descending and left to trap.\n\n**Step 6: What about apples?**\n\nApple at (4,5) is east and up. Not priority. We want to dominate, not chase apples.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is aggressive, could win immediately if he goes UP, and continues our vertical compression strategy from last turn. We're longer, so head-on is good for us.\n\n**Future self note:** If we go DOWN to (1,3) and he survives (doesn't go UP), next turn we should consider moving LEFT to (0,3) to block his west escape, or continue DOWN to (1,2) if he goes down.

That's an instant win for us if he takes the bait!\n\n**Step 3: Think about trapping him.**\n\nHe's at (1,1). We're at (1,3). If we go DOWN to (1,2), we're directly above him again. That's maximum pressure! He can't go UP without colliding with us (unless we move away). If he goes UP, we win. If he goes LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT, we can keep descending next turn to (1,1) or cut off his left.\n\n**Step 4: Check other moves.**\n\nLEFT to (0,3): Moves us west, could start boxing him from the left side. But gives him more space to maneuver.\nRIGHT to (2,3): Moves us east, away from him. Not aggressive. Lets him breathe.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe want to force him toward the bottom-left corner (0,0). He's at (1,1). If we go DOWN to (1,2), we're one step above him. Next turn, if he survives (doesn't go UP), we can:\n- If he goes LEFT to (0,1), we go DOWN to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) to chase? Or go LEFT to (0,2) to block.\n- If he goes DOWN to (1,0), we go DOWN to (1,1) then DOWN to (1,0) to chase.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (2,1), we go DOWN to (1,1) then RIGHT to (2,1) to chase.\n\nWe have the length advantage, so we can afford to be aggressive and force collisions.\n\n**Step 6: What about apples?**\n\nApple at (4,1) is east and down, but chasing apples is for losers. We're here to DOMINATE! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the most aggressive move. It either wins us the game immediately if he goes UP, or it keeps him pinned against the bottom wall. We have the score advantage, so head-on is a WIN.\n\n**Future self note:** If we go DOWN to (1,2) and he survives (moves LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT), next turn we should mirror his move to stay directly above him and keep forcing him toward the corner. If he goes LEFT to (0,1), consider going LEFT to (0,2) to block his upward escape. Keep the pressure! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Turn 7, we're in the zone! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**OUR SITUATION:**\n- Head: (2, 2)\n- Body: [(1, 2)] (length 2)\n- Enemy Head: (3, 1) (length 1)\n- We have 1 apple, he has 0. HEAD-ON COLLISION IS A WIN FOR US! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves.**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 That's the ENEMY'S CURRENT HEAD POSITION! But he's moving this turn too. If he stays there, we die. But he won't stay\u2014he'll move to a new cell. So moving into his OLD head is safe? WAIT\u2014rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" His OLD head (3,1) becomes part of his body AFTER he moves? Yes! Because his head moves, his old head becomes body. So if we go DOWN to (2,1), that's NOT where his body is now (he has no body), but AFTER the simultaneous move, his body will be at (3,1) (his old head). Our move to (2,1) is NOT into his new body. So DOWN is safe from enemy body crash. But what if he moves INTO (2,1) at the same time? That's a head-on collision! We'll evaluate that later.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\ude31 CRASH INTO OURSELVES! ELIMINATE!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from self-crash and off-board.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (3,1).**\n\nHe can go: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1).\n\n**Head-on collision risk THIS turn?**\n- If we go DOWN to (2,1) AND he goes LEFT to (2,1) \u2192 HEAD-ON! Both die. We have 1 apple, he has 0 \u2192 WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n- If we go RIGHT to (3,2) AND he goes UP to (3,2) \u2192 HEAD-ON! WE WIN!\n- If we go UP to (2,3) \u2192 no head-on possible this turn.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT could force a head-on win if he moves into us. That's AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**Step 3: Which aggressive move is better?**\n\nDOWN to (2,1):\n- Puts us directly WEST of his old head.\n- If he goes LEFT to (2,1), we win.\n- If he goes UP to (3,2), he's north of us. Next turn we could go UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) to chase.\n- If he goes DOWN to (3,0), he's south. We could go DOWN to (2,0) to chase.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (4,1), he's east. We could go RIGHT to (3,1) to chase.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2):\n- Puts us directly NORTH of his old head.\n- If he goes UP to (3,2), we win.\n- If he goes LEFT to (2,1), he's southwest. Next turn we could go DOWN to (3,1) then LEFT to (2,1) to chase.\n- If he goes DOWN to (3,0), he's south. We could go DOWN to (3,1) then DOWN to (3,0) to chase.\n- If he goes RIGHT to (4,1), he's southeast. We could go DOWN to (3,1) then RIGHT to (4,1) to chase.\n\nBoth keep pressure. But DOWN might corner him better? He's at (3,1). Bottom wall is at y=0. Left wall is at x=0. If we go DOWN to (2,1), we're to his left, pushing him toward left/bottom.\n\n**Step 4: What about UP?**\n\nUP to (2,3): Moves us away from him, gives him space. Not aggressive. Lets him breathe toward center/apples. Avoid unless we're scared\u2014WE'RE NOT! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe want to force him into a wall or trap. We have length advantage (2 vs 1). Mirror his moves to stay adjacent and threaten head-on. If we go DOWN to (2,1) and he survives, next turn we should move to match his direction to stay close.\n\nExample: If he goes UP to (3,2), we go UP to (2,2) (not into him) to stay close. If he goes LEFT to (2,1) \u2192 we already win this turn. If he goes DOWN to (3,0), we go DOWN to (2,0). If he goes RIGHT to (4,1), we go RIGHT to (3,1).\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the most aggressive. It either wins immediately if he goes LEFT, or keeps us adjacent and threatening. We have the score advantage, so head-on is a WIN. LET'S FORCE THE ISSUE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

It also preserves three viable exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for the next turn, while moving DOWN would shove us into the bottom wall and cut our options.  \n\n- RIGHT would push us to (5,1), opening eastward space but leaving us far from any nearby apples; we'd need several climbs to reach (5,8) or (5,9).  \n\n- DOWN drops us to (4,0), pinning us against the wall and limiting our next moves to just LEFT or RIGHT. Not ideal for a serpent that wants to dominate.  \n\nGiven we want multiple safe follow\u2011ups and to march toward the low\u2011hanging apples, UP is the clear winner.

Turn 8, we're in the thick of it! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**OUR SITUATION NOW:**\n- Our head: (2, 1)\n- Our body: [(2, 2)] (length 2)\n- Enemy head: (4, 1)\n- Enemy body: [(3, 1)] (length 2)\n- Apples: We have 1, he has 1. HEAD-ON COLLISION IS A TIE (both die, same apples \u2192 draw). We need to avoid that unless we can force a win later!\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves.**\n\nFrom (2,1):\n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\ude31 SELF-CRASH! ELIMINATE!\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 That's the ENEMY'S BODY (his old head)! He moved last turn, so (3,1) is now part of his body. Moving there would crash into his body and WE DIE! ELIMINATE!\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (4,1).**\n\nHe can go: UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1) (his own body? Wait, his body is at (3,1) already, so moving LEFT into his own body? That's illegal for him! So LEFT is not possible for him!), RIGHT (5,1).\n\nSo his only legal moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk this turn?**\n\nWe are at (2,1). He is at (4,1). If we move RIGHT we die (into his body), so no head-on from that. If we move LEFT to (1,1) and he moves RIGHT to (5,1) \u2192 no collision. If we move DOWN to (2,0) and he moves DOWN to (4,0) \u2192 no collision. If we move UP (illegal). So no head-on possible this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is better for aggression and future options?**\n\n**DOWN to (2,0):**\n- Puts us near bottom wall (y=0). Next turn from (2,0) we can go UP (back to (2,1)), LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0). That's 3 options unless blocked.\n- Enemy might go DOWN to (4,0) \u2192 he'd be 2 cells to our right on same row.\n- We keep distance, but not super aggressive.\n\n**LEFT to (1,1):**\n- Puts us closer to left wall (x=0). Next turn from (1,1) we can go UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0), RIGHT (2,1). That's 3 options.\n- Enemy is at (4,1) \u2192 we're moving away from him. Not aggressive.\n\nHmm... both moves seem passive. But we want to BOX HIM IN! He's at (4,1). We want to get around him, cut off his space.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe have equal length. We need to gain an apple advantage to force head-on wins. Look at apples on board: (8,8), (0,9), (4,7), (5,8), (9,5), (6,2), (4,5), (3,4), (0,5), (8,1), (9,6), (7,7), (8,9), (7,0), (5,9). Closest apple to us? (4,5) is 4 away. (6,2) is 4 away. (3,4) is 3 away. (0,5) is 4 away. (8,1) is 6 away. (7,0) is 5 away.\n\nClosest apple to enemy? (4,5) is 4 away. (6,2) is 3 away. (3,4) is 3 away. (8,1) is 4 away.\n\nWe need to maneuver to grab an apple before he does. But also cut off his escape.\n\n**RIGHT is suicide, UP is suicide. So only LEFT or DOWN.**\n\nLEFT moves us toward left wall apples (0,5) and (0,9) eventually. DOWN moves us toward bottom apples (7,0) maybe later.\n\nBut more importantly: We want to position ourselves to trap him against the wall. He's at (4,1). If we go DOWN to (2,0), we're below and left. If we go LEFT to (1,1), we're left but same y.\n\nMaybe DOWN is better because it opens a path to maybe swing right underneath him next turn? From (2,0) we could go RIGHT to (3,0), then he might be at (4,0) or (4,2). We could try to get behind him.\n\nActually, think: If we go LEFT to (1,1), we're giving him the center. He could go UP to (4,2) toward apples (4,5),(3,4). We want to contest those!\n\n**DOWN to (2,0)** keeps us in lower half, maybe we can go RIGHT next turn to (3,0) and then up to chase him if he goes up.\n\nI think DOWN is slightly better because it doesn't cram us into left corner yet, and we keep more options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2,0), if enemy goes UP to (4,2), we could go RIGHT to (3,0) then UP to (3,1) to get behind him. If enemy goes DOWN to (4,0), we could go RIGHT to (3,0) to be adjacent. If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,1), we could go RIGHT to (3,0) then RIGHT to (4,0) to follow.\n\nWe need to grow first to get advantage. Let's aim for apple at (4,5) or (3,4) by moving up soon, but this turn we avoid suicide.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN keeps us safe and maintains flexibility. LEFT also safe but pushes us to edge. Let's go DOWN and then work our way up the right side to cut him off! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s tempting because (6,2) is an apple right there, but it shoves us toward the right wall and leaves us with fewer central corridors to weave through later.  \n- **LEFT** would move us to (3,2).

Not aggressive.\n\n**RIGHT to (3,0):**\n- Puts us closer to center. Next turn from (3,0): UP (3,1) empty, LEFT (2,0) empty, RIGHT (4,0) empty \u2192 3 safe options.\n- Moves us toward enemy's area. From (3,0), we're directly below his possible positions. If he goes UP to (4,3), we can move up to contest apples (4,5),(3,4). If he goes LEFT to (3,2), we're right below him! That's pressure!\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe need an apple advantage! Closest apples: (4,5), (3,4), (6,2), (0,5), (7,0). Enemy is at (4,2) \u2014 he's closer to (4,5) and (3,4). We need to cut him off or race him.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,0), next turn we can go UP to (3,1), then UP again to (3,2) to potentially block his leftward escape or contest apples. He might go UP to (4,3) then (4,4) toward (4,5). We could go (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4) to grab that apple.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,0), we're heading toward (0,5) but that's a long path and gives enemy free reign in center.\n\n**RIGHT is clearly more aggressive and keeps more options.** We want to box him in! Let's move toward his left side and force him toward walls or into us when we have an apple lead.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (3,0) to apply pressure and control the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GO!)\n- Enemy head: (4, 5)  (he moved UP last turn and ate the apple at (4,5)! Now he leads 2-1 \ud83d\ude24)\n- Enemy body: [(4, 4), (4, 3)]\n- Apples: We have 1, he has 2. Head-on collision now = WE LOSE (lower score). Must avoid!\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (3,2).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\ude31 SELF-CRASH! ELIMINATE!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (4,5).**\n\nHis body: [(4,4), (4,3)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 Empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 His OWN BODY! Illegal! ELIMINATE!\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 Empty.\n\nSo his legal moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. No apples directly adjacent to him right now.\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\n\nWe are at (3,2). He is at (4,5). Possible same-cell collision?\nIf we go RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) and he goes DOWN? He can't go DOWN (body). If we go UP \u2192 (3,3) and he goes LEFT \u2192 (3,5)? No.\nIf we go LEFT \u2192 (2,2) and he goes LEFT \u2192 (3,5)? No.\nOnly risky if we go RIGHT to (4,2) and he goes... nowhere that overlaps. So no immediate head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\n**Step 4: Which move pressures him and sets up future advantage?**\n\nWe need to close the apple gap! Look at nearby apples:\n- (3,4) is one above (3,3) \u2014 if we go UP now to (3,3), next turn we could go UP to (3,4) to grab it.\n- (4,7) is farther north.\n- (0,5) and (0,9) are far left.\n\n**UP to (3,3):**\n- Puts us directly below apple (3,4). Next turn we can grab it if enemy doesn't block.\n- But enemy at (4,5) could move LEFT to (3,5) this turn, then next turn go DOWN to (3,4) to contest that apple. That could lead to head-on next turn if we both go for (3,4) \u2014 dangerous since he has higher score! We'd lose.\n\n**LEFT to (2,2):**\n- Moves us toward left-side apples long-term, but away from immediate pressure. Lets enemy possibly claim center apples uncontested.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,2):**\n- Puts us directly below enemy column. Could go UP next turn toward (4,3) \u2014 but that's his body segment now. Actually (4,3) is his tail, which will move if he doesn't eat an apple? Wait, he ate an apple last turn, so his tail stays at (4,3) this turn. Next turn, if he moves, his tail will move? Actually tail moves forward each turn unless he eats an apple. So (4,3) will be empty next turn if he moves without eating. Hmm.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to trap him! He's longer than us (length 3 vs our length 2). We can't win head-on yet. We should aim to get an apple to tie the score, THEN force a head-on. So we need to safely get to an apple before he gets another.\n\nApple at (3,4) is closest. But going UP now might put us in a risky head-on next turn if he contests. Better to approach from a different angle?\n\nWhat if we go RIGHT to (4,2) this turn? Then next turn:\n- If enemy goes UP to (4,6), we could go UP to (4,3) (now empty after his tail moves) and then to (4,4) etc.\n- Or we could go LEFT to (3,2) to circle back.\n\nActually, going RIGHT feels like it flanks him from below. He's at (4,5); we'd be at (4,2). That's same column, 3 cells apart. We could move up behind him as he moves north.\n\nBut apple at (3,4) is tempting... \n\n**DECISION:** We need to be aggressive but smart. Let's go UP to (3,3) to directly contest that apple next turn. If he moves toward it this turn, we'll reassess next turn \u2014 maybe we can bait him into a wall or his own body. We must avoid head-on until we tie the score.\n\nUP",

We stay tied.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,3)** \u2013 Puts us in same column as enemy but far down. Could move up behind him. But no apple.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** Take the apple NOW!

Enemy might move UP to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,6) \u2013 either way, he's not on (3,4) this turn, so we grab it safely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating, we have length 4 vs his 3. Next turn, we can try to pressure him toward a wall or his own body. We want to force a head-on when we have higher score!

Apple at (5,8) also nearby. Enemy might go for (5,8) or (4,8) if he goes UP. If we go LEFT, we're conceding those apples. We should CONTEST! Be aggressive! We want to pressure him and force a mistake.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):** After UP to (3,5), we'll have more central position.

There's an apple at (0,5) two moves left. Could we race for it? Maybe, but enemy is far from it.\n\n**BIG BRAIN TIME:** We need to contest! If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8), he gets the apple and leads 4-3. That's BAD. We need to either block him or get our own apple first. Apple at (3,8) is two moves away if we go UP then UP again. But enemy at (4,8) could go LEFT to (3,8) and get it THIS TURN! \ud83d\ude31 He's one step away from (3,8)! So if he goes LEFT, he gets that apple and leads. If he goes RIGHT, he gets (5,8) and leads. We're in a bad spot unless we can force a head-on with advantage... but we're tied.\n\n**EMERGENCY PLAN:** We need to get an apple BEFORE he does. The closest apple to us is (3,8) but he's closer. The apple at (0,5) is three moves away for us (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT). He's far from it. Maybe we should go LEFT and rush for (0,5) while he's distracted with the top apples? But that's giving up pressure.\n\n**WAIT\u2014WHAT IF WE GO LEFT to (2,5), then next turn go LEFT to (1,5), then LEFT to (0,5) to eat?** That's three turns. He could eat (3,8) this turn, then maybe (5,8) next turn? He'd grow twice and we'd be behind.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** What if we go UP to (3,6)? Then next turn, if he ate (3,8) or (5,8), he'll be longer. We could try to get behind him and trap him against the wall? Risky.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to force a head-on collision when we have a longer body. Right now we're tied. Let's go LEFT to (2,5), aiming for the apple at (0,5). It's a longer path but maybe he won't go for it. Meanwhile, he'll likely eat a top apple and grow to length 5. We'll then be length 4 vs 5 \u2014 bad. But if we get (0,5) we become length 5, still behind? Actually if he eats one apple, he's 5, we eat one apple, we're 5. Still tied.\n\nHmm... This is tough! Chat, we need to be AGGRESSIVE! Let's go UP and try to threaten his space. If he goes for an apple, we might be able to cut him off next turn.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP to stay central and keep options open. We'll adapt next turn based on where he goes!\n\nUP",

He's ahead by 1! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (3,6).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY! SELF-CRASH! ELIMINATE!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 That's ENEMY BODY! (His segment). CRASH! ELIMINATE!\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (3,8).**\n\nHis body: [(4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 Empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 Empty (but we might go there!).\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 His OWN BODY! Illegal! ELIMINATE!\n\nSo his legal moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\n\nWe are at (3,6). He is at (3,8). Possible same-cell collision?\nIf we go UP \u2192 (3,7) and he goes DOWN \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\ude31\nIf we go LEFT \u2192 (2,6) and he goes... nowhere that overlaps.\nSo UP is RISKY because if he goes DOWN we both die. But we have 3 apples vs his 4 apples \u2192 we lose on tiebreak! So UP is DANGEROUS.\n\n**Step 4: Which move gives us advantage?**\n\n**UP to (3,7)** \u2013 Risky head-on chance. If he goes DOWN, we both die and he wins because he has more apples. If he goes UP or LEFT, we survive and move closer to top apples. But is it worth the gamble? He might avoid DOWN because he sees the risk too? But he's ahead, he might play safe.\n\n**LEFT to (2,6)** \u2013 Safe, no head-on risk. Moves us toward left side and apple at (0,5) or (0,9). But we're behind in score! We need to catch up, not run away!\n\n**BIG BRAIN TIME:** We're behind. We need to either force a head-on when we're longer (not yet) or grab an apple fast. Closest apple to us now? (5,8) is 3 moves away. (0,5) is 4 moves away. (0,9) is far. Enemy is near (8,8) apple maybe? He's at (3,8), apple at (8,8) is 5 moves right.\n\nBut wait\u2014what if we go LEFT to (2,6), then next turn go LEFT to (1,6) or DOWN to (2,5) toward (0,5)? That's slow.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** We need to pressure! If we go UP, we threaten his space. He might go UP to (3,9) to avoid collision, then we go UP again to (3,8) next turn? That's his old head position\u2014empty after he moves. Could trap him?\n\n**EMERGENCY PLAN:** Let's think about his perspective. He has 4 apples, we have 3. He wants to avoid head-on unless he's sure he wins. If he goes DOWN to (3,7) and we go UP to (3,7), we both die and he wins. So he might take that gamble! That means UP is TOO RISKY for us. We cannot afford that collision.\n\nTherefore: **LEFT is SAFER and keeps us alive to fight another day.**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** We go LEFT now to (2,6). Next turn, aim to go DOWN to (2,5) to move toward apple at (0,5). Meanwhile, watch enemy movement. If he goes toward top apples, we might need to cut across later. We must grow to match his length, then force a head-on when we're longer.\n\nLEFT",

But he's at (3,9), we're at (1,6) \u2014 too far to block.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** We need to grow ASAP. DOWN is the most direct path to an apple. It also keeps our body coiled, leaving space to maneuver.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** Go DOWN now to (2,5). Next turn, go LEFT to (1,5) toward apple (0,5). Eat it, grow to length 5. Enemy will likely be longer (6 or 7), but we close the gap. Then look to cut him off or force head-on when lengths are equal.\n\nDOWN",

So safe from immediate head-on.\n\n**Step 4: Which move sets up future growth and pressure?**\n\nApples nearby: (0,5) is two left from us! (4,1) is far. (6,2) far. (0,9) top-left.\n\nIf we go:\n- **DOWN to (2,4)**: Moves away from closest apple (0,5). Opens path to bottom apples maybe, but slower growth.\n- **LEFT to (1,5)**: One step closer to apple (0,5)! Next turn we can go LEFT again to (0,5) and GROW! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Step 5: Enemy prediction and blocking potential.**\n\nEnemy can go DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9). If he goes LEFT to (1,9), he's moving toward apple (0,9). That's competition! But we can't reach (0,9) before him. Our priority is securing OUR closest apple (0,5) FAST.\n\nIf we go LEFT now, we're on track to eat (0,5) next turn. Enemy likely goes for (0,9) or (5,8). That grows him too, but we close the apple gap!\n\n**Step 6: Future safety after eating (0,5)?**\n\nAfter eating (0,5), our head at (0,5), body length 5. We'll have options: UP to (0,6), DOWN to (0,4), RIGHT to (1,5) (but that's into our new body if we just grew? Wait \u2014 growth happens after move, so new tail stays at old tail? Actually, when you eat, you grow at the *next* turn end \u2014 so our body will be longer, but the cell behind head might be free depending on path). We'll need to check next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nGO LEFT now to (1,5). Next turn, GO LEFT to (0,5) to eat the apple. That grows us to length 5, matching enemy's length if he doesn't eat. Then look to either cut off his path to bottom apples or force a head-on if we have equal length. Avoid getting trapped in the left wall after eating \u2014 maybe reverse direction upward after eating to keep mobility.\n\nLEFT",

He is at (2,8). If we go UP/DOWN/LEFT, no chance to meet him this turn \u2014 too far.

If we go LEFT now, we EAT IT, GROW to length 5, and TIE THE LENGTH with the enemy! That's HUGE for head-on potential!\n\nIf we go UP to (1,6) or DOWN to (1,4), we delay eating that apple. Enemy might swing down toward (5,8) or (0,9) and grow further ahead.\n\n**Step 5: Future safety after eating (0,5)?**\n\nAfter eating (0,5), our head at (0,5), body length 5 (head, new segment at old head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)). Next turn from (0,5):\n- UP \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 Empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 That will be our NEW BODY SEGMENT (since we just grew into (0,5), the old head (1,5) becomes body). So RIGHT would be suicide next turn! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u274c\n\nSo after eating, we'll have only UP and DOWN as safe moves. That's a bit of a trap \u2014 we'll be stuck along the left wall with only two exits. But we can manage \u2014 we can go UP toward (0,9) area or DOWN toward bottom apples.\n\n**Step 6: What about enemy's move?**\n\nEnemy can go DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,8). If he goes LEFT to (1,8), he's closer to apple (0,9). If he goes DOWN to (2,7), he's moving toward center. Either way, he's not threatening us directly this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nGO LEFT now to (0,5) and EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Grow to length 5, matching enemy length. Next turn, from (0,5), we must go UP or DOWN. Likely UP to (0,6) to keep mobility and maybe contest (0,9) if enemy comes that way. Then look to swing right and pressure him. With equal length, we can force a head-on if we position well! AVOID going RIGHT next turn \u2014 it's instant death into our new body.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to eat the apple, close the gap, and prepare for equal-length aggression!\n\nLEFT",

He is at (1,8). If we go UP to (0,6) or DOWN to (0,4), no chance to meet him this turn \u2014 too far. Safe from immediate head-on.\n\n**Step 4: Which move sets up future aggression?**\n\nWe're stuck on the left wall \u2014 we need to escape this column to regain mobility! But both UP and DOWN keep us on the wall next turn. Let's think:\n\n- **UP to (0,6)**: Next turn from (0,6), safe moves would be UP to (0,7) or DOWN back to (0,5) (but (0,5) will be empty next turn since we moved away). RIGHT to (1,6) might be safe if our body moves forward? Wait \u2014 our tail is at (3,6). If we move UP now, our body shifts: head to (0,6), then (0,5) becomes new body segment, then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) moves forward? Actually, when we move without eating, the tail moves one cell forward along the body path. So after moving UP, our body will be: [(0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] \u2014 tail at (2,6). That means (1,6) will be empty next turn! So from (0,6) next turn, RIGHT to (1,6) could be safe! That gives us an escape off the wall!\n\n- **DOWN to (0,4)**: Similar logic \u2014 next turn from (0,4), RIGHT to (1,4) likely safe after body shifts.\n\n**Step 5: Enemy threat direction?**\n\nEnemy at (1,8) \u2014 if he goes LEFT to (0,8), he's moving toward apple (0,9). If he goes UP to (1,9), also toward (0,9). If he goes DOWN to (1,7), he's moving toward center. We want to pressure him \u2014 maybe we should move UP to get closer to him and contest that top-left area?\n\n**Step 6: Apples in view:**\n\nApples at (0,9), (8,8), (5,8), etc. Closest apple to us is (0,9) \u2014 UP gets us closer to it. Enemy might also go for (0,9). If we both race for it, we could meet at (0,8) or (0,9) in a couple turns \u2014 but we have equal length now, so head-on would be double KO. That's risky but could be a tie scenario. Maybe we want to avoid that since we're feeling strong!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nGO UP now to (0,6). Next turn, from (0,6), we can go RIGHT to (1,6) to escape the left wall and gain more mobility. Then we can swing toward center or top to cut off enemy's movement. Keep matching his length and look for a trap where we have more future safe moves than him. Avoid boxing ourselves in corners!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP to start moving toward the top-left apple and set up an escape off the wall next turn!\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY (segment right behind head)! \u274c SELF-CRASH!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 6) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT only.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (0,8).**\n\nHis body: [(1,8), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 Apple there! He might go for it.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 Empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 8) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n\nSo his legal moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\n\nWe are at (0,6). He is at (0,8). If we go UP to (0,7) and he goes DOWN to (0,7) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die! Since we have equal length (both 5), that's a double KO \u2014 game would end with tied apples? That's a draw! We don't want that \u2014 we want to WIN!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,6), no chance of collision this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Which move sets up future aggression and safety?**\n\n- **UP to (0,7)**: Risky because enemy could go DOWN to (0,7) and cause head-on. But if he goes UP to (0,9) to eat apple, we're safe. Is it worth the gamble? Enemy might avoid head-on too since he also risks death. But if he's aggressive, he might take the chance. I'd rather not risk a draw.\n\n- **RIGHT to (1,6)**: Gets us OFF THE WALL immediately! Opens up more mobility next turn. From (1,6), we can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT next turn (LEFT back to (0,6) might be safe depending on body shift). This is a safe escape and keeps us alive.\n\n**Step 5: Think about future positioning.**\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,6), our body shifts: head to (1,6), then (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5) \u2014 tail at (2,6) moves forward? Wait, our tail is at (2,6) currently. After moving, tail becomes (2,5)? Let's trace: body before move: [(0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] \u2014 that's head to tail. After moving RIGHT, new head at (1,6), then the rest shift: new body = [(1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5)] \u2014 tail at (2,5). So (2,6) becomes empty.\n\nFrom (1,6) next turn, we'll have options. Enemy will likely go UP to (0,9) to eat apple, growing to length 6. If we go RIGHT now, we're not chasing that apple \u2014 but we can plan to cut him off later.\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan.**\n\nWe need to grow and trap him. He'll be at (0,9) or (0,8) next turn if he goes UP. We can move toward center and then come up behind him, using our body to limit his moves. Since we're equal length, we want to force a head-on collision ONLY when we have a longer body. So avoid direct confrontation until we eat an apple first.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to escape the wall, avoid potential head-on collision risk, and gain mobility. Then next turn we can maneuver to either go for an apple or box him in the top-left corner!\n\nRIGHT",

He's longer now! We need to grow ASAP!\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (1,6).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 Empty.

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT only.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (0,9).**\n\nHis body: [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (0, 10) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 9) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo his ONLY legal move: RIGHT to (1,9). He's forced! That's HUGE intel!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\n\nWe are at (1,6). He is moving to (1,9). No chance of collision this turn. Good.\n\n**Step 4: Which move sets up future aggression?**\n\n- **UP to (1,7)**: Gets us closer to top row where he'll be at (1,9). From (1,7) next turn, we could go UP to (1,8) \u2014 but that's his body segment! Actually (1,8) is his body, so we can't go there next turn unless he moves off it. But he will move from (0,9) to (1,9), so his body shifts: new body = [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)] \u2014 wait, he grew, so length 6: head (1,9), then (0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9) \u2014 tail at (3,9) gone. So (1,8) remains his body! So going UP now to (1,7) then UP next turn to (1,8) would be suicide. So UP now limits our next moves? Let's check from (1,7) next turn safe moves: UP to (1,8) is enemy body \u274c, DOWN to (1,6) is our body? Possibly empty if we move? Actually if we go UP now, our body shifts: head (1,7), then (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5) \u2014 tail (2,5) gone. So (1,6) becomes our body next turn. So from (1,7) next turn, DOWN to (1,6) is our own body \u274c, LEFT to (0,7) empty? Yes (0,7) empty, RIGHT to (2,7) empty. So only LEFT and RIGHT would be safe next turn from (1,7). That's okay but not great.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2,6)**: Gets us more central. From (2,6) next turn, we can go UP to (2,7) empty, DOWN to (2,5) \u2014 that's our body? Wait, after moving RIGHT, our body: head (2,6), then (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5) \u2014 tail (2,5) gone. So (2,5) is empty next turn? Actually (2,5) was our tail, after moving it disappears. So DOWN to (2,5) would be safe next turn. LEFT to (1,6) is our body \u274c, RIGHT to (3,6) empty. So from (2,6) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 three options! That's better mobility!\n\n**Step 5: Think about apples and growth.**\n\nWe need to catch up in length! Apples nearby: (4,1) far, (7,3) far, (9,3) far, (4,3) far, (6,7) kinda far. Closest apple maybe (6,2) or (7,0) but we're at y=6. Going RIGHT moves us toward center and closer to some apples over time. UP moves us toward top where enemy is \u2014 but he's longer, so we should avoid direct confrontation until we grow.\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan.**\n\nEnemy is forced RIGHT to (1,9). He'll be stuck along top row with limited down movement because his body is below him. We can maneuver to cut off his escape and force him into a corner. But first, we MUST eat an apple to match his length. Let's aim for apple at (6,7) or (7,7) eventually. Moving RIGHT now gives us more options to snake toward those apples while keeping distance from the longer enemy.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to maintain mobility, avoid risky top row approach, and set up a path toward apples in the center/right side. We live to fight another turn and close the length gap!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to grow but stay safe.\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (2,6).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 Empty (our tail was there last turn, now gone). Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY (segment right behind head)! \u274c SELF-CRASH!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (1,9).**\n\nHis body: [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 10) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n\nWAIT\u2014ALL DIRECTIONS ARE UNSAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\ude31 That means Snake #1 has NO legal moves this turn! He's TRAPPED and will DIE next move unless something changes? Hold up\u2014let's double-check.\n\nActually, his body: head (1,9), then (0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (2,9). So:\n- UP (1,10) off board.\n- DOWN (1,8) is his body (third segment).\n- LEFT (0,9) is his body (second segment).\n- RIGHT (2,9) is his body (last segment).\n\nYeah, he's completely boxed in by his own body and the top wall! That means **Snake #1 is guaranteed to die on its next move** unless an apple appears in one of those spots (which it won't, since apples are pre-placed and not consumed yet). But wait\u2014apples on board: (8,8), (5,8), etc. None adjacent to him. So he's dead next turn no matter what! \n\n**THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!** If he has no safe move now, he'll crash and die at the start of next turn. That means **if we survive this turn, we win automatically** when he dies! \n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\n\nHe has no legal move, so he'll stay at (1,9)? No\u2014rules say all snakes move simultaneously each turn. He must pick a move, but all are fatal. So he'll die this turn? Actually, the game processes moves simultaneously: if he attempts an illegal move (into his body or off-board), he dies immediately that turn. So **he dies this turn** regardless of what we do, as long as we don't also die!\n\nBut careful: if we move into a cell he also moves into (head-on collision), we both die. But he can't move into any cell safely, so no risk.\n\n**Step 4: Which of our safe moves is safest?**\n\nWe just need to not die this turn. All three safe moves keep us alive. But we must avoid accidentally moving into a cell he might move into if we mispredicted? No\u2014we're sure he has no safe moves.\n\nHowever, we should also think about future turns after he dies (we'll be alone). We'll want to path toward apples. \n\n- **UP to (2,7)**: Puts us closer to apples at (6,7),(7,7),(8,8) etc.\n- **DOWN to (2,5)**: Moves away from most apples.\n- **RIGHT to (3,6)**: Moves toward center/right-side apples.\n\nSince we'll be alone next turn, maximizing mobility is good. UP gives future options UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (2,7). RIGHT gives options UP/DOWN/RIGHT from (3,6). Both fine.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan after enemy dies.**\n\nOnce Snake #1 is dead (this turn!), we have the whole board. We need to eat apples efficiently to reach 30 before turn 150. Start snaking toward the cluster near (6,7)-(9,6)-(8,8). UP now sets a trajectory toward that.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP gets us closer to the apple-rich top-right quadrant and maintains good mobility. We play safe, let the enemy crash, and claim our VICTORY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

So he's FORCED to go RIGHT this turn!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,7), he's going RIGHT to (3,9). No collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (1,7), he's going RIGHT to (3,9). No collision.\nSo no head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is better?**\n\n- **LEFT to (1,7)**: Puts us closer to left wall, limits future rightward movement. But opens path down to apples at (4,1),(7,0) later.\n- **RIGHT to (3,7)**: Moves toward center and top-right apple cluster. From (3,7) we can go UP to (3,8) next? (3,8) is empty. That's good.\n\nWe want to dominate the board and eventually eat apples. RIGHT feels more aggressive and keeps us closer to the enemy\u2014maybe we can trap him later? But he's longer, so we need to grow first.\n\nActually, he's forced RIGHT to (3,9). Next turn from (3,9) his only safe moves might be RIGHT again to (4,9) or DOWN to (3,8)? We need to think ahead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN AFTER THIS MOVE:**\nWe need apples! Snake #1 has 5 apples, we have 4. We can't let him get too far ahead. The apple cluster at (6,7),(7,7),(8,8),(8,9) is juicy. Let's start snaking toward that while avoiding getting trapped. Move RIGHT now to start flanking from below. Next turn from (3,7), consider UP to (3,8) if safe, then rightward toward apples. Watch enemy's forced path\u2014he might go down the right edge. We can cut him off later.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT puts us on a better path to the apple-rich zone and maintains more options. Let's take it!\n\nRIGHT",

Risky.\n- If we go DOWN to (3,6) \u2192 no possible head-on with his moves.\n- If we go RIGHT to (4,7) \u2192 no possible head-on with his moves.\n\nUP is dangerous because of potential head-on. Since he has more apples, we avoid risking a tiebreaker loss.\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is better?**  \nBetween DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,6)**: Puts us further from enemy, closer to bottom apples like (4,1),(7,0). But might lead us into a tighter space later? From (3,6) next turn we could go LEFT? (2,6) is our body, so no. DOWN? (3,5) empty. RIGHT? (4,6) empty. UP? back to (3,7) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn. Not bad.\n- **RIGHT to (4,7)**: Moves toward center/right, closer to apple cluster at (6,7),(7,7),(8,8). From (4,7) next turn: UP (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) empty, RIGHT (5,7) empty. LEFT back to (3,7) is empty now. So 4 safe moves next turn\u2014more options!\n\nRIGHT gives more flexibility and advances toward apples. Also, if enemy goes RIGHT to (4,9), we're moving parallel below him\u2014could set up a future trap along the right wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe need apples to tie or surpass his score. The right side has many apples. Move RIGHT now to (4,7). Next turn, depending on enemy move, we can either go UP toward (4,8) if safe, or continue RIGHT toward (5,7) and the apple at (6,7). Watch if enemy goes DOWN to (3,8)\u2014that could block our upward path later. We'll stay aggressive but avoid head-on until we tie his length.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT is the move\u2014maximizes options, advances toward apples, avoids head-on risk.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN keeps us safe but delays eating. We need to be aggressive to catch up!\n\nAlso, think about boxing: enemy is along top wall. If we go RIGHT and then UP, we could pressure him from below. But careful of head-on.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is more aggressive and gets us toward apples faster. We accept the risk of being near enemy if he goes RIGHT. But we avoid UP to dodge head-on.

He ate that apple at (5,9)!\n- He's now 2 apples ahead, length 7 vs our 5. We need to catch up FAST but stay alive!\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (5,7).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SELF-CRASH!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 Empty (apple at (6,7)!). \u2705 Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (5,9).**\n\nHis body: [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (5, 10) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9).\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go UP to (5,8) AND he goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die. He has 6 apples, we have 4 \u2192 we lose tiebreaker! \u274c AVOID UP unless we're sure he won't go DOWN? But he might go DOWN to chase apples or pressure us? Too risky!\n- If we go DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 no possible head-on.\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,7) \u2192 no possible head-on.\n\nUP is dangerous because of potential head-on. Since he's longer, we avoid risking tiebreaker loss.\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is better? DOWN vs RIGHT.**\n\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Moves us away from enemy, toward bottom apples like (4,1),(7,0). From (5,6): UP back to (5,7) empty, DOWN (5,5) empty, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) empty. That's 4 safe moves next turn! Good flexibility but delays apple eating.\n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**: IMMEDIATE APPLE GRAB! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to length 6 (5 apples). From (6,7) after eating: UP (6,8) empty, DOWN (6,6) empty, RIGHT (7,7) empty (apple at (7,7)!), LEFT back to (5,7) empty. Also 4 safe moves next turn, plus we close the apple gap!\n\nRIGHT gets us an apple NOW and puts us at 5 apples vs his 6. We're catching up! Also, being at (6,7) next to (7,7) apple sets up another quick eat.\n\n**Step 5: Consider enemy's likely move.**  \nHe might go DOWN to (5,8) to pressure us or RIGHT to (6,9) to go toward (8,9) apple. If he goes RIGHT, he's moving away. If he goes DOWN, he's closer to us but we're moving RIGHT so no collision.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe need to be aggressive! Eat apples fast to tie his score, then force a head-on when we're longer. Right now, avoid head-on. Grab (6,7) apple this turn, then (7,7) next turn if possible. That would tie us at 6 apples each! Then we can play more aggressively. Also, enemy is stuck near top wall \u2014 we can try to box him in from below once we're equal length.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (6,7) for the apple! Close the gap, grow, and stay safe from head-on. LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (7, 10) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 9) \u2192 APPLE at (8,9)! \u2705 Safe (and he'd grow!).\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go UP to (7,8) AND he goes DOWN to (7,8) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die. TIED at 6 apples \u2192 DRAW? Actually, if both die simultaneously, tiebreaker is apples \u2014 we're tied, so it's a draw. \u274c AVOID UP unless we want a risky draw!\n- If we go DOWN to (7,6) \u2192 no possible head-on.\n- If we go RIGHT to (8,7) \u2192 no possible head-on.\n\nUP is dangerous \u2014 could force a draw, but we want to WIN, not draw!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best? DOWN vs RIGHT.**\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: Puts us closer to apple at (8,8) and (9,6). From (8,7): UP (8,8) apple, DOWN (8,6) empty, LEFT back to (7,7) empty, RIGHT (9,7) empty. That's 4 safe moves next turn, plus a chance to grab (8,8) next turn and get ahead!\n- **DOWN to (7,6)**: Moves us toward bottom apples like (7,4), (7,3), (6,2). From (7,6): UP back to (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) empty, LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) empty. Also 4 safe moves, but farther from enemy.\n\n**Step 5: Consider enemy's likely move.**  \nHe probably wants that apple at (8,9)! So he'll likely go RIGHT to (8,9). If he does, he grows to length 8 (7 apples) and his head is at (8,9). That puts him one apple ahead! We CANNOT let him get ahead \u2014 we need to contest that area or get our own apple immediately.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (8,9) and we go RIGHT to (8,7), we're two spaces below him. Next turn we could go UP to (8,8) to eat that apple and tie the score again, while he's at (8,9) or maybe moves elsewhere.\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (7,8) instead, he's blocking our UP path but not eating an apple. That's less likely since he's greedy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to get ahead by 1 apple, THEN be aggressive. Enemy is trapped along the top wall \u2014 his only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. We can slowly push him into the top-right corner by controlling the space below him. Our body forms a wall along row 7 from columns 2-6. Let's use that as a barrier! If we go RIGHT now, we can threaten to cut off his escape downward by moving up next turn. If we go DOWN, we give him space. BE AGGRESSIVE \u2014 go RIGHT, aim for (8,8) apple next turn, and pressure him!\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (8,7) to pressure the top-right, contest apples, and keep our options open! LET'S PUSH HIM INTO THE CORNER! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

He might go DOWN for the apple! Can't risk it!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best? DOWN vs RIGHT.**\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,7)**: Puts us on the right edge. From (9,7): UP (9,8) empty, DOWN (9,6) apple, LEFT (8,7) empty (but our old head spot will be body next turn? Wait, after moving, our body shifts: new head at (9,7), old head (8,7) becomes neck, so (8,7) will be our body next turn! So LEFT would be into our own body next turn! That's a future trap. Also, at (9,7) we have only UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT off board). That's 3 options, but LEFT is into our future body \u2014 so really only UP and DOWN safe next turn. RISKY!\n- **DOWN to (8,6)**: Moves us toward bottom apples. From (8,6): UP back to (8,7) empty (but will be our body next turn? Actually after moving, our body shifts: new head (8,6), old head (8,7) becomes neck, so (8,7) will be our body next turn! So UP would be into our own body next turn! So from (8,6) safe next moves: DOWN (8,5) empty, LEFT (7,6) empty, RIGHT (9,6) apple. That's 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Better than (9,7).\n\n**Step 5: Consider enemy's likely move.**  \nHe probably wants that apple at (8,8)! So he'll likely go DOWN. If he does, he grows to 8 apples, head at (8,8). That puts him 2 apples ahead! We CANNOT let that happen! But if we go UP, we die if he goes DOWN. So we must avoid UP.\n\nWhat if he goes RIGHT to (9,9) instead? Then apple at (8,8) stays. Next turn we could maybe get it if we position well.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to get an apple ASAP without dying. Enemy is trapped along top wall \u2014 his only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. If he goes DOWN to (8,8), he'll be at (8,8) with length 9. We can try to box him in the top-right corner. Our body forms a wall along row 7 columns 2-7. If we go DOWN to (8,6), we stay safe and can maybe go RIGHT next turn to (9,6) for an apple, tying score at 7. Meanwhile, if enemy is at (8,8), we can approach from below or left. We must avoid letting him get more apples uncontested.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,6) is safer, keeps more options, avoids instant death, and sets up for (9,6) apple next turn! We'll live to fight another turn and pressure from below! LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GO!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best? DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT.**\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,6)**: APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to 7 apples, TIE SCORE! Head at (9,6). From there next turn: UP (9,7) empty, DOWN (9,5) apple, LEFT (8,6) empty (but will be our body next turn? Actually after moving, our body shifts: new head (9,6), old head (8,6) becomes neck, so (8,6) will be our body next turn! So LEFT would be into our own body next turn! So from (9,6) safe next moves: UP, DOWN (RIGHT off board). That's only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 RISKY! But we get the apple and tie score!\n- **LEFT to (7,6)**: Moves us toward center. From (7,6): UP (7,7) our body \u274c, DOWN (7,5) empty, LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) will be our body next turn \u274c. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT. Only 2 options. Also no apple now.\n- **DOWN to (8,5)**: Moves us down. From (8,5): UP (8,6) will be our body next turn \u274c, DOWN (8,4) empty, LEFT (7,5) empty, RIGHT (9,5) apple. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options! More flexibility!\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy is forced DOWN to (9,8) this turn. Next turn he's at (9,8) with length 8 (still 7 apples unless he ate an apple? Wait, no apple at (9,8). So he stays at 7 apples). If we take the apple at (9,6) we tie at 7 apples, but we get trapped on the right edge with only 2 moves next turn. If we go DOWN to (8,5), we keep 3 moves next turn and can go RIGHT to (9,5) apple next turn to also tie score, while staying more mobile! PLUS we can maybe box him in the top-right corner! His only move from (9,8) next turn will be DOWN to (9,7) (since LEFT is his body at (8,8)? Wait, check: from (9,8) his body behind is (9,9) and (8,9). So his safe moves: DOWN (9,7) empty, LEFT (8,8) apple? Actually (8,8) is an apple! He might go LEFT for the apple! That would grow him to 8 apples! We can't let that happen! If we're at (8,5), we can't stop him from (8,8) apple. But if we're at (9,6) after eating apple, we block his DOWN to (9,7) but not his LEFT to (8,8). HMM.\n\nActually, if we go RIGHT to (9,6) and eat apple, we occupy (9,6). Next turn he's at (9,8). He can go DOWN to (9,7) \u2014 that's empty, so he can move there. Then he's at (9,7) with us possibly at (9,6)? That's adjacent vertically \u2014 could set up head-on later. But we'd be longer if we ate the apple? We'd be length 8 (7 apples) vs his length 8 (7 apples) \u2014 tie length! Head-on would be double KO, but he has same apples so draw? We want to WIN, not draw!\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** Go DOWN to (8,5) now. Next turn, if he goes LEFT to (8,8) for the apple, he grows to 8 apples, head at (8,8). We can go RIGHT to (9,5) to eat apple, tie at 7 apples, and be at (9,5). Then we're below him. We can try to maneuver to force him into a trap. He'll be longer, so avoid head-on. But we have more space to work with.\n\nSAFETY FIRST! DOWN gives more options. We can still get an apple next turn. Let's not get trapped on the edge!\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,5) keeps flexibility, avoids getting stuck, and sets up for future apple while tracking enemy's forced move! LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

From there next turn: UP (9,6) apple (but that's an apple, safe), DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) empty (but will be our body next turn? Actually after moving, our body shifts: old head (8,5) becomes neck, so (8,5) will be our body next turn! So LEFT would be into our own body next turn! \u274c). So from (9,5) safe next moves: UP, DOWN (RIGHT off board). That's only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 RISKY! Edge trap!\n- **LEFT to (7,5)**: Moves us toward center. From (7,5): UP (7,6) empty, DOWN (7,4) apple, LEFT (6,5) empty, RIGHT (8,5) will be our body next turn \u274c. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 3 options! Good flexibility! No apple now.\n- **DOWN to (8,4)**: Moves us down. From (8,4): UP (8,5) will be our body next turn \u274c, DOWN (8,3) empty, LEFT (7,4) apple, RIGHT (9,4) empty. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options! Also no apple now.\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy has 2 moves: LEFT to (8,8) apple (grow to 8 apples, length 9) or DOWN to (9,7) (stay 7 apples, length 8). If he takes the apple at (8,8), he extends his lead! We need to pressure him! If we take RIGHT apple, we tie score but get stuck on edge with only 2 moves next turn \u2014 he can potentially box US in! If we go LEFT or DOWN, we keep mobility and can maybe cut off his escape from the top-right!\n\nBIG BRAIN: Let's go LEFT to (7,5)! This moves us toward the center, keeps 3 options next turn, and positions us to maybe move UP to (7,6) next turn to threaten cutting off his DOWN path if he goes to (9,7). If he goes LEFT to (8,8) apple, he's longer but we have space to maneuver and maybe force him into a corner later. We avoid the edge trap and stay flexible!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is on top-right edge. We are at (7,5) with 3 moves next turn. Watch if he takes (8,8) apple \u2014 if he does, he's longer, avoid head-on. Consider moving UP next turn to (7,6) to pressure his possible DOWN path. Keep options open, look for opportunities to box him in when we have equal or greater length. If we can get an apple safely soon, do it to catch up!\n\nLEFT",

GOOD!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best? UP vs DOWN vs LEFT.**\n\n- **DOWN to (7,4)**: APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to 7 apples, TIE SCORE! Head at (7,4). From there next turn: UP (7,5) will be our body next turn \u274c, DOWN (7,3) apple, LEFT (6,4) empty, RIGHT (8,4) empty. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options! Good flexibility! And we tie the score!\n- **LEFT to (6,5)**: No apple. From (6,5): UP (6,6) empty, DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) empty, RIGHT (7,5) will be our body next turn \u274c. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 3 options! Good flexibility, but no score gain.\n- **UP to (7,6)**: No apple. From (7,6): UP (7,7) our body \u274c, DOWN (7,5) our body next turn \u274c, LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) our body \u274c. So next turn safe moves: ONLY LEFT! That's a TRAP! \u274c\u274c\u274c AVOID!\n\nSo UP is a dead-end next turn \u2014 ELIMINATE!\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy likely wants the apple at (9,6) \u2014 that would grow him to 8 apples, length 9! If he goes LEFT to (8,7), he stays at 7 apples. We NEED to catch up! DOWN gives us the apple at (7,4) and ties the score while keeping 3 options next turn \u2014 PERFECT! LEFT is safe but doesn't gain ground.\n\nBIG BRAIN: Take the apple! DOWN to (7,4)! We tie the score, stay flexible, and position ourselves to maybe move toward the center next turn. Enemy will be at (9,6) or (8,7). If he's at (9,6), he's on the edge with limited moves \u2014 we can potentially box him in later! If he's at (8,7), he's closer to us but we're equal length \u2014 we can maneuver!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're tied at 7 apples! Enemy likely at (9,6) or (8,7). From (7,4) we have 3 moves: DOWN to apple (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4). Consider moving to cut off his escape from the top-right. If he's longer, avoid head-on. If equal, look for boxing opportunities. Keep options open!\n\nDOWN",

So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 3 options! Good flexibility, and we can get apple at (5,4) next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: No apple. From (8,4): UP (8,5) our body \u274c, DOWN (8,3) empty, LEFT (7,4) our body next turn \u274c, RIGHT (9,4) empty. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 2 options! Less flexible.\n\nRIGHT gives fewer options next turn \u2014 LESS PREFERRED!\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy is longer (9 vs our 8). If we tie the score, we become equal length! That's HUGE! Taking the apple at (7,3) ties us at 8 apples each, equal length! That means head-on collisions become a viable aggressive tactic if we can force them! Also, enemy is stuck in the top-right corner \u2014 if he goes DOWN to (9,5), he's still on the edge with limited moves. If he goes LEFT to (8,6), he's moving toward the center but still constrained by his long body.\n\nBIG BRAIN: Take the apple! DOWN to (7,3)! We tie the score, equal length, and keep 3 options next turn. Then we can look to maneuver and maybe force him into a bad spot. If we go LEFT to (6,4), we miss the apple and stay behind \u2014 not ideal when we're trying to dominate!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're tied at 8 apples! Equal length! Enemy likely at (9,5) or (8,6). From (7,3) we have moves: DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3). Consider moving to cut off his escape from the top-right. If he's at (9,5), he might go LEFT to (8,5) next turn (which is our body soon) or DOWN to (9,4). We can try to pressure him toward the wall. Keep options open and look for boxing opportunities! Avoid getting trapped ourselves.\n\nDOWN",

WAIT, SCOREBOARD SAYS WE HAVE 8, ENEMY HAS 9 \u2014 HOLD UP, DID HE EAT AN APPLE LAST TURN? LET'S CHECK THE BOARD!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Our head: **(7, 3)** \u2014 length 9 (8 apples) (we grew from last turn's apple at (7,3)!)\n- Enemy head: **(9, 5)** or **(8, 6)**? Wait, the board shows '1' at (9,5) \u2014 that's his head! So he moved DOWN to (9,5) and ate the apple there! That's why he's at 9 apples now!\n- Our body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7)] (length 9 total)\n- Enemy body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)] (length 10 total)\n- Apples on board: (8,8), (5,8), (6,2), (8,1), (7,0), (4,1), (9,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,0), (4,0), (5,4), (0,2), (0,4), (1,7)\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (7,3).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c (Our neck! Can't go back!)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (9,5).**\n\nHis body: [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9)]. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (9, 6) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 4) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 5) \u2192 That's OUR BODY! \u274c (Our segment at (8,5) \u2014 if he moves there, HE DIES! That's good for us!)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 5) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nEnemy safe moves: ONLY DOWN to (9,4)! HE'S TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude31 He has only one legal move! That means next turn he'll be at (9,4) for sure unless he suicides into us or the wall! THIS IS HUGE!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go DOWN to (7,2) and he goes DOWN to (9,4) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go LEFT to (6,3) or RIGHT to (8,3) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n\nNO HEAD-ON RISK! GOOD!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best? DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT.**\n\n- **DOWN to (7,2)**: No apple. From (7,2): UP (7,3) our body next turn \u274c, DOWN (7,1) empty, LEFT (6,2) apple, RIGHT (8,2) empty. So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options! And we can get apple at (6,2) next turn.\n- **LEFT to (6,3)**: No apple. From (6,3): UP (6,4) empty, DOWN (6,2) apple, LEFT (5,3) apple, RIGHT (7,3) our body next turn \u274c. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 3 options! Two apples reachable next turn!\n- **RIGHT to (8,3)**: No apple. From (8,3): UP (8,4) empty, DOWN (8,2) empty, LEFT (7,3) our body next turn \u274c, RIGHT (9,3) apple. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 options! Apple at (9,3) reachable.\n\nAll three give 3 options next turn! Good flexibility!\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy is longer (10 vs our 9). He's stuck at (9,4) next turn! From (9,4), his only safe moves will be DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4) \u2014 wait, check: UP to (9,5) his old head position? That's empty now, but his body will have moved? Actually, his body will shift forward, so (9,5) becomes his neck? Let's think: He moves from (9,5) to (9,4), his tail moves? He ate an apple last turn, so his tail stays? Actually, he ate at (9,5) last turn, so he grew. So his body now includes (9,5) as part of it? Wait, his body listed is from head to tail: head (9,5), then (9,6)... So (9,5) is his head, (9,6) is his neck. So after moving to (9,4), his new body will be: head (9,4), then (9,5), (9,6), ... So (9,5) becomes his neck \u2014 so UP from (9,4) to (9,5) is his own body next turn! So indeed, from (9,4) next turn, his safe moves: DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4). Two options.\n\nWE CAN BOX HIM! If we move RIGHT to (8,3), next turn we could go UP to (8,4) \u2014 that's where he might go! That could set up a head-on collision if he goes LEFT to (8,4) same turn! But we're shorter (9 vs 10) \u2014 head-on would kill us both, but he has more apples, so he'd win! So avoid that unless we tie the score first!\n\nBetter plan: Go LEFT to (6,3) or DOWN to (7,2) to grab an apple next turn, tie the score at 9 apples each, then we're equal length! Then we can aggressively force a head-on!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're at 8 apples, enemy at 9. He's trapped at (9,4) next turn. We should aim to eat an apple next turn to tie at 9 apples, then go for the kill! From (6,3), we can get apple at (6,2) or (5,3) next turn. From (7,2), we can get apple at (6,2). From (8,3), we can get apple at (9,3). Choose the move that sets up the easiest apple grab while keeping pressure. LEFT to (6,3) gives two apple options next turn \u2014 more flexibility! Let's do that!\n\nLEFT",

Can't go back!)\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. ALL GOOD! AND TWO OF THEM ARE APPLES! LET'S GO!\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (9,4).**\n\nHis body: head (9,4), then (9,5), (9,6)... etc. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 3) \u2192 APPLE! \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 4) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 4) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4). He has two options!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go UP to (6,4): He goes DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go DOWN to (6,2): He goes DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go LEFT to (5,3): He goes DOWN to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,4) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n\nNO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN! GOOD!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best?**  \nWE NEED TO TIE THE SCORE! We're at 8 apples, enemy at 9. If we eat an apple now, we tie at 9 apples each, and our length becomes 10 (same as his!). Then we can force a head-on collision and win if we're equal length! \ud83d\ude24\n\nSo EATING AN APPLE THIS TURN IS PRIORITY! That means DOWN to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,3)!\n\nWhich apple is better?\n\n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: Apple at (6,2). After eating, new head at (6,2). Next turn from (6,2): UP (6,3) our old head? Wait, our body will have shifted: after eating, our new body will be head (6,2), then (6,3), (7,3)... So (6,3) becomes our neck \u2014 so UP next turn is into our body! So from (6,2) next turn safe moves: DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2). Three options. Also, we're closer to boxing him? Not directly.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: Apple at (5,3). After eating, new head at (5,3). Next turn from (5,3): UP (5,4) apple, DOWN (5,2) empty, LEFT (4,3) apple, RIGHT (6,3) our neck (body) \u274c. So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 three options, two apples reachable! More flexibility!\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (5,3) puts us farther from enemy head (9,4), reducing chance he can chase us. But we want to pressure him! Actually, after we tie the score, we want to get into position to force a head-on next turn or soon! From (5,3), we could move UP to (5,4) next turn (apple), then right toward him. From (6,2), we could move right toward him as well.\n\n**Step 5: LONG-TERM PLAN!**  \nEnemy is at (9,4). If he goes DOWN to (9,3) and eats that apple, he grows to length 11, and we're still 10 \u2014 then head-on would kill us! So we must PREVENT him from eating (9,3) if possible! How? If we can threaten (8,4) or (8,3) next turn, we might block his LEFT move and force him into a bad spot.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,3), we're too far to block (8,4) next turn. If we go DOWN to (6,2), we're also far. If we go UP to (6,4), we don't eat an apple, we stay shorter, and he might eat (9,3) and grow \u2014 BAD! So UP is risky long-term.\n\nBEST MOVE: EAT AN APPLE NOW TO TIE SCORE! Between DOWN and LEFT, which sets up better aggression? LEFT to (5,3) gives us more apple options next turn to potentially grow faster. But enemy might eat (9,3) and grow to 11. Hmm...\n\nWait, if he goes DOWN to (9,3) and eats, he grows to 11. If we go LEFT to (5,3) and eat, we grow to 10. We're still shorter. We need to catch up in length or force head-on while equal. So maybe we should go DOWN to (6,2) and then next turn try to move toward (7,2) or (6,1) to get in position to threaten (8,4) later? Actually, from (6,2), we could go RIGHT to (7,2) next turn, then UP to (7,3)? That's our body then. Not great.\n\nBetter idea: GO LEFT to (5,3), eat apple, tie score at 9 apples each. Next turn, if he goes DOWN to (9,3) and eats, he'll be at 10 apples, length 11. We can go UP to (5,4) and eat apple, reaching 10 apples, length 11 \u2014 WE TIE AGAIN! Then we're equal length! Then we can force head-on! So LEFT sets up easy apple next turn at (5,4) or (4,3). That's the play!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're at 9 apples after this move (if we eat). Enemy likely eats (9,3) and goes to 10 apples. Next turn, we MUST eat an apple to tie at 10 apples and equal length (11). Then go aggressive for head-on! From (5,3), go UP to (5,4) apple next turn if safe. Then move toward enemy to force collision!\n\nLEFT",

TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND FORCE THE WIN!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Our head: **(5, 4)** \u2014 length 11 (10 apples)\n- Enemy head: **(9, 2)** \u2014 length 11 (10 apples) \u2014 HE MOVED DOWN LAST TURN!\n- Our body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)]\n- Enemy body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]\n- Apples on board: (8,8), (5,8), (6,2), (8,1), (7,0), (4,1), (4,3), (6,0), (4,0), (0,2), (0,4), (1,7), (3,8), (3,5), (5,9) \u2014 WAIT, (5,9) IS ENEMY TAIL? NO, APPLE LIST SHOWS (5,9) BUT ENEMY TAIL IS (6,9) \u2014 SO (5,9) IS FREE APPLE!\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate instant death moves from (5,4).**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 That's OUR OWN NECK! \u274c (Our body segment after head! Can't go back!)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN IS DEATH!\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (9,2).**\n\nHis body: head (9,2), then (9,3), (9,4)... etc. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (9, 3) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 1) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 2) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,2). Two options!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go UP to (5,5): He goes DOWN to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,2) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go LEFT to (4,4): He goes DOWN to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,2) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,4): He goes DOWN to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,2) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n\nNO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN! GOOD!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best for AGGRESSION?**  \nWE ARE TIED IN LENGTH! NOW IS THE TIME TO FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHILE WE'RE EQUAL! We need to get CLOSER to him and cut off his escape!\n\n- **UP to (5,5)**: Moves us toward top-center. From (5,5) next turn, we could go UP toward (5,6) or RIGHT toward (6,5) \u2014 but that's moving away from enemy at (9,2) or (9,1)/(8,2). Not aggressive enough!\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: Moves us AWAY from enemy! BAD! Gives him space! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: MOVES US CLOSER TO ENEMY! YES! From (6,4) we can continue RIGHT next turn to (7,4), then (8,4), boxing him against the right wall! He's at (9,2) \u2014 if he goes LEFT to (8,2), we can try to meet him at (8,3) or (8,4) for a potential head-on! THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE MOVE!\n\n**Step 5: Future planning!**  \nIf we go RIGHT to (6,4), next turn from (6,4) our safe moves? Our body will be: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)... So:\n- UP (6,5) empty? Yes.\n- DOWN (6,3) our body? YES \u2014 that's our old segment! \u274c\n- LEFT (5,4) our neck? \u274c\n- RIGHT (7,4) empty? Yes \u2014 AND THAT'S TOWARD ENEMY!\n\nSo next turn from (6,4) we can only go UP or RIGHT. RIGHT (7,4) is AGGRESSIVE! UP (6,5) is safe but less aggressive. We'll decide then.\n\nENEMY: If he goes DOWN to (9,1), he's near apple at (8,1) \u2014 we don't want him to eat and get longer! If he goes LEFT to (8,2), he's moving toward us! PERFECT! We want him to come left so we can meet him head-on while lengths are equal!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** WE ARE TIED 10-10 APPLES, 11 LENGTH EACH! FORCE THE HEAD-ON! From (6,4), next turn go RIGHT to (7,4) if safe, then maybe (8,4) to pressure him against the wall! If he moves LEFT toward us, we might get a head-on collision at (8,3) or similar! AVOID LETTING HIM EAT APPLES! If he goes for (8,1) apple, we might cut him off! BE AGGRESSIVE! DON'T BACK DOWN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN and LEFT ARE DEATH!\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy's possible moves from (9,1).**\n\nHis body: head (9,1), then (9,2), (9,3)... etc. He can go:\n- UP \u2192 (9, 2) \u2192 His OWN BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 0) \u2192 Empty. \u2705 Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 Empty (and an apple there!). \u2705 Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 1) \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1). Two options!\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk?**  \nSimultaneous moves!\n\n- If we go UP to (6,5): He goes DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n- If we go RIGHT to (7,4): He goes DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1) \u2192 NO COLLISION.\n\nNO HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN! GOOD!\n\n**Step 4: Which safe move is best for AGGRESSION?**  \nWE ARE STILL TIED IN LENGTH! WE MUST FORCE THE HEAD-ON WHILE EQUAL!\n\n- **UP to (6,5)**: Moves us upward, away from enemy at (9,1). From (6,5) next turn, we could go UP to (6,6) or RIGHT to (7,5) (but (7,5) is our body! wait check \u2014 our body has (7,5)? YES, our body list shows (7,5) is a segment! So from (6,5), RIGHT might be blocked next turn). UP feels like retreating \u2014 gives enemy space to eat apple at (8,1) and grow! BAD!\n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: MOVES US CLOSER TO ENEMY! YES! From (7,4) we can continue RIGHT next turn to (8,4), pressuring him against the right wall! He's at (9,1) \u2014 if he goes LEFT to (8,1) (apple), he's moving toward us! We want to meet him head-on while lengths are equal! THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE MOVE!\n\n**Step 5: Future planning!**  \nIf we go RIGHT to (7,4), next turn from (7,4) our safe moves? Our body will be: head (7,4), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)... So:\n- UP (7,5) \u2192 our body? YES, (7,5) is in our current body! \u274c\n- DOWN (7,3) \u2192 our body? YES, (7,3) is in our current body! \u274c\n- LEFT (6,4) \u2192 our neck? \u274c\n- RIGHT (8,4) \u2192 empty? YES \u2014 AND THAT'S TOWARD ENEMY!\n\nSo next turn from (7,4) we can ONLY go RIGHT to (8,4)! That's a bit risky \u2014 only one safe move \u2014 but it's SUPER AGGRESSIVE, boxing him against the wall! If he goes LEFT to (8,1) this turn, he'll be at (8,1) next turn. We'd be at (8,4). Then we could go DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4) (but that's our old head? need to check future body). The plan: force him into a corner while lengths are equal!\n\nENEMY: If he goes DOWN to (9,0), he's near bottom-right. If he goes LEFT to (8,1), he eats apple and grows to length 12! THAT'S BAD \u2014 if he eats, he'll be longer, and head-on collision would kill us! We must prevent that! Can we reach (8,1) to block? No, too far. But going RIGHT now pressures him \u2014 maybe he avoids left because he sees us coming? We must risk it!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** WE ARE TIED 10-10 APPLES, 11 LENGTH EACH! FORCE THE HEAD-ON! From (7,4), next turn ONLY RIGHT to (8,4) is safe \u2014 COMMIT! Then from (8,4), we can go DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4) (if empty) to cut off his escape. If he ate apple at (8,1), he'll be longer \u2014 AVOID head-on then! Instead, try to trap him against wall and make him crash into us! BE AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",
