We're LIVE and ready to crush this snake duel! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's analyze the board state:\n\n**Current Position (Turn 0):**\n- **Me (Snake 1):** Head at (7, 9), body none, apples: 0\n- **Enemy (Snake 0):** Head at (5, 4), body none, apples: 0\n\n**Apple Drops:** Multiple apples scattered, including (8, 8), (9, 9), (9, 7), (8, 9) which are ALL right near my head at (7, 9)! That's CONTENT waiting to be eaten! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Board State Analysis:**\nMy head is at (7, 9) which is near the top-right corner. Looking at coordinates:\n- (7, 9) is my head position\n- (8, 8), (9, 9), (9, 7), (8, 9) are apples RIGHT THERE!\n\nAvailable moves from (7, 9):\n1. **UP:** Would go to (7, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! That's instant death! \u274c\n2. **DOWN:** Would go to (7, 8) - SAFE! (7, 8) has an apple at (8, 8) nearby. No body collision.\n3. **LEFT:** Would go to (6, 9) - SAFE! (6, 9) is empty, moving toward the apple at (8, 9).\n4. **RIGHT:** Would go to (8, 9) - SAFEST OPTION! (8, 9) contains an apple! That's INSTANT growth and +1 point! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**DEATH ELIMINATION:**\n- UP = Death (off board) - ELIMINATED! \u274c\n- DOWN = Safe\n- LEFT = Safe  \n- RIGHT = Safe AND gets an apple!\n\n**STRATEGIC REASONING:**\nRight now, both snakes have 0 apples. The enemy is at (5, 4) far from my position. Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) gives me:\n- First apple! (+1 point, grow by 1)\n- Position closer to the cluster of apples in the top-right corner\n- Establishes dominance early\n- Leaves enemy chasing behind\n\nIf I move DOWN or LEFT, I'm not capitalizing on the apple RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! That's throwing away free content! The enemy might also move toward apples, but I'm in the perfect position to dominate this corner and establish board control.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nDominate the top-right quadrant! Once I eat (8, 9), I'll have my tail at (7, 9) and head at (8, 9). From there, I can target (9, 9) and (9, 7) next, creating a wall that blocks the enemy from the north side. Force them to the bottom-left where I can box them in. Keep growing and remember to avoid head-on collisions unless I have the score advantage (which I will after this apple).\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT to (8, 9) for that sweet apple! Let's gooooo! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We're back LIVE and we're CLAWING our way to victory! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nTurn 1, let's break this down! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE:**\n- **Me (Snake 1):** Head at (8, 9), body at (7, 9), apples: 1\n- **Enemy (Snake 0):** Head at (5, 5), body: none, apples: 0\n- **My tail:** (7, 9)\n- **Board edge:** Top row is y=9, right edge is x=9\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (8, 9):**\n\n**UP:** (8, 10) \u2192 OFF THE BOARD! \u274c **DEATH!** Can't go up from top row!\n\n**DOWN:** (8, 8) \u2192 Contains an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But wait... my body at (7, 9) stays. Safe move, gets another apple. BUT... is there a better play?\n\n**LEFT:** (7, 9) \u2192 My own tail! This is moving BACKWARDS into my own body! \ud83d\udc80 That's INSTANT DEATH! Don't be that guy!\n\n**RIGHT:** (9, 9) \u2192 Contains an apple at (9, 9)! \ud83c\udf4e AND (9, 9) is also listed in the apple drops! Safe move, gets apple #2!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nMoving LEFT is suicide (backwards into myself). Moving UP is suicide (off board). \n\nSo we're between:\n- **DOWN to (8, 8)** \u2192 Gets apple at (8, 8), but now my body occupies (7, 9) and (8, 9)\n- **RIGHT to (9, 9)** \u2192 Gets apple at (9, 9), body at (7, 9) and (8, 9)\n\nBoth get an apple! Both are safe! But...\n\n**THE AGGRESSION FACTOR:** The enemy is at (5, 5) with ZERO apples. I'm at (8, 9) with 1 apple. Moving RIGHT to (9, 9) puts me in the TOP-RIGHT CORNER. This is a power position! I can control the entire right edge and top row. From (9, 9), next turn I'll have options to go DOWN along the right wall or LEFT back into the board.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 8), I'm still in the corner but one row lower. Both are good, but RIGHT feels more dominant - I'm claiming the absolute corner! That's CONTENT! That's POSTURE!\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (5, 5) will probably chase apples. The closest apples are at (3, 2), (4, 3), (1, 1), (3, 1). They're in the bottom-left quadrant. Meanwhile, I'm in the top-right. We're on opposite sides of the board! Perfect for boxing them in later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the top-right apples, create a wall along the right edge. From (9, 9), go DOWN along the wall, then LEFT. The enemy is cornered in bottom-left. When I have more apples, force a confrontation. Growth = dominance.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to (9, 9) for that apple and the corner!

Let's analyze the board and plot our next move to crush this enemy snake. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Snake:** Head at (9, 9), Body at (8, 9) and (7, 9), Apples: 2\n- **Enemy Snake:** Head at (6, 5), Body: none, Apples: 0\n- **My Score:** 2 apples\n- **Enemy Score:** 0 apples\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (9, 9):**\n\n**UP:** (9, 10) \u2192 OFF THE BOARD! \u274c Instant death. NOPE.\n\n**LEFT:** (8, 9) \u2192 My own body! My body at (8, 9) is my second segment. Moving into my own body = DEATH. NOPE.\n\n**DOWN:** (8, 9) \u2192 Wait, same issue! (8, 9) is my body. Moving DOWN from (9, 9) goes to (8, 9), which is occupied by my second segment. That's hitting myself! DEATH. NOPE.\n\n**RIGHT:** (10, 9) \u2192 OFF THE BOARD! \u274c Instant death. NOPE.\n\nWAIT... HOLD UP CHAT! I just realized something TERRIBLE! All four moves from (9, 9) would kill me:\n- UP = off board\n- LEFT = into my body\n- DOWN = into my body (8, 9)\n- RIGHT = off board\n\n**BUT WAIT!** Let me check the board state again carefully. The board shows:\n```\n9 . . . . . . . T T 1\n```\nAt y=9 (top row), positions:\n- (0,9): .\n- (1,9): .\n- (2,9): .\n- (3,9): .\n- (4,9): .\n- (5,9): .\n- (6,9): .\n- (7,9): T (This is my tail! Wait, that says T?)\n- (8,9): T (Another T?)\n- (9,9): 1 (My head)\n\nBut my snake list says my body is [(8,9), (7,9)]. So at (8,9) and (7,9) are my body segments.\n\nLooking at the board notation: \"T\" probably marks my tail area, but the actual positions matter. My head is at (9,9), body at (8,9) and (7,9).\n\n**MOVING LEFT TO (8,9)** would hit my own body segment. That's suicide.\n\n**MOVING DOWN TO (9,8)** would be (9,8). Let me check what's at (9,8):\nLooking at the board, row 8 shows: (9,8) = A (apple!)\nBut wait, my body is at (8,9) and (7,9), so (9,8) is clear!\n\n**MOVING DOWN to (9,8) is SAFE!** That's an apple location too! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVING UP:** (9,10) - off board \u274c\n**MOVING LEFT:** (8,9) - my own body \u274c  \n**MOVING RIGHT:** (10,9) - off board \u274c\n**MOVING DOWN:** (9,8) - apple, safe! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 8) gets me an apple and keeps me on the right edge. From there, I'll be able to move DOWN further along the wall or LEFT into the board. The enemy at (6,5) is far away in the middle-left. I'm at 2 apples, they're at 0. I'm winning!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (9,8), continue down the right wall (9,7), (9,6) - both have apples! Eat the entire right edge, then sweep left through the middle to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Force them into a corner.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (9,8) for the apple and survival! Let's GOOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

That's a potential head-on collision if I go RIGHT next turn. But for this turn, DOWN is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (7,7):**\n   - **CHECKING:** (7,7) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e \n   - **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (7,7) I can go LEFT (7,6), DOWN (7,6), UP (7,8), RIGHT (back to 8,7). Actually wait - (7,6) is empty, (7,8) is empty. \n   - **STRATEGIC:** Moving LEFT takes me TOWARD the center, away from the enemy on the right edge. This is safer long-term. I can control more board space.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (9,7):**\n   - **CHECKING:** (9,7) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - **RISK:** (9,6) also has apple. But (9,7) is MY SAFE MOVE RIGHT NOW.\n   - **ENEMY THREAT:** Enemy at (9,5) could move RIGHT? No, that's off board. Could move UP to (9,6), LEFT to (8,5), or DOWN to (9,4). If he goes UP, I'd be at (9,7) and he'd be at (9,6) - safe.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY - I'M UP 3-1!** \n- I'm LEADING!

At (9,7) it's an apple!\n- Row 8 shows \". . . . . . . . 1 T\" - (8,8) is empty!

Safe. Future: can go LEFT (7,6), DOWN (8,5), RIGHT (9,6).\n\n- **LEFT (7,7):** HAS APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Safe. Future options good toward center.\n\n- **RIGHT (9,7):** HAS APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Safe. Future: can go DOWN to (9,6) or LEFT to (8,7) (but that's my current spot, would be backwards).\n\n**DECISION TIME - WHAT'S THE PLAY?**\n\n**FAVORING LEFT TO (7,7):** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Eat apple at (7,7) - GROW! Score becomes 4-1!\n- **STRATEGIC POSITIONING:** Moving LEFT toward center board (7,7) gives me better control and more escape routes.\n- **ENEMY AVOIDANCE:** I'm moving AWAY from enemy at (9,5), reducing risk of head-on collision.\n- **FUTURE MOVES:** From (7,7) I can go LEFT (7,6), DOWN (7,6), UP (7,8), or back RIGHT (8,7). Lots of options!\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** Taking the center is KEY in snake. I'll dominate the board!\n\n**WHY NOT RIGHT (9,7)?** \nYes, it's also an apple, but it puts me on the right edge with fewer options. Plus, enemy is already on that edge. Taking the center is smarter!\n\n**WHY NOT DOWN (8,6)?**\nIt's safe but doesn't get me an apple immediately. I'm ahead - I should GROW!\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY CALL:** LEFT to (7,7) to claim that apple and take board control! CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nAfter eating (7,7), I'll have body [(8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9)]. Next turn, I'll evaluate enemy position. If he's still on right edge, I can press from the center. If he moves toward me, I have space to maneuver. My goal: force him into a corner while maintaining my apple lead. Let's box him in!\n\nLEFT",

(From board row 8: \". . . . . . . . 1 T\" - (7,8) is dot)\n   - **SAFETY:** No body, no walls, no immediate collision.\n   - **FUTURE:** From (7,8) I could go UP (7,9), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8 - but that's my body!), DOWN (back to 7,7). Actually RIGHT is blocked by my own body at (8,7)! **WARNING!** (8,8) is my body segment! So from (7,8), RIGHT would be (8,8) - CRASH! Left would be (6,8), up (7,9). Okay, limited but safe.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (7, 6):** \n   - **CHECKING:** (7, 6) is EMPTY! (Board row 6: \". . A . . . . . . 0\" - (7,6) is dot)\n   - **RISK:** Enemy at (9,6) might move LEFT to (8,6), but not to (7,6).

I can see an apple at (5,7) nearby!\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7):** \n   - **CHECKING:** (8, 7) IS MY OWN BODY! That's my second segment! **INSTANT DEATH!** \u274c\u274c\u274c\n   - **VERDICT:** **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** This is a self-crash. Game over if I do this.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE ANALYSIS - SCORE IS 3-2:**\n- I'm STILL LEADING, but enemy is catching up. Need to keep pressure!\n- **Enemy at (9,6):** Where could he go? UP to (9,7) (apple), LEFT to (8,6) (empty), DOWN to (9,5) (his body). If he goes UP, he gets an apple. If he goes LEFT, he's moving toward center but away from immediate growth.\n- **My goal:** Maintain lead, avoid head-on collision, control board space.\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT (8,7):** CRASH INTO MY BODY. **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**RANKING SAFE MOVES (UP, DOWN, LEFT):**\n\n**3rd PLACE - UP to (7,8):**\n- Safe, but limited future options because RIGHT is blocked by my own body. I'd be heading toward top edge (7,9) with only LEFT or UP as real options. Getting squeezed! NOT ideal for long-term board control.\n\n**2nd PLACE - DOWN to (7,6):**\n- Solid move! Safe, opens up (7,5) down, (6,6) left, (8,6) right. **FOUR future directions!** Good escape routes. Brings me toward center-lower area. Enemy might move UP or LEFT. Head-on collision? Possibly if he goes LEFT to (8,6) and I go RIGHT to (8,6) next turn - but that's preventable. This is a **contingency play** - grow safely, keep options open.\n\n**1st PLACE - LEFT to (6,7):** \ud83c\udfc6 **THE PLAY!**\n- **SAFE:** Empty cell, no immediate threats.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** **PERFECT!** From (6,7): LEFT (5,7), UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), RIGHT (7,7). **FOUR DIRECTIONS!** Maximum mobility! \n- **BOARD CONTROL:** Moving LEFT toward center-left, I can dominate that region. \n- **APPLE ACCESS:** (5,7) is just LEFT of here - an apple!

No more lead to hold onto\u2014time to make a move that sets up for the win!\n\n**TURN 7 ANALYSIS - SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 7) - Just moved here last turn!\n- **My Body:** [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8)] - My old tail (9,8) is gone now since we moved forward. Moving into (6,7) means the tail (9,8) gets removed. Wait, let me recalculate: Our body is always connected. If head moves from (7,7) to (6,7), the old head (7,7) becomes first body segment, (8,7) stays, (8,8) stays, and (9,8) gets popped off. So new body is [(7,7), (8,7), (8,8)].\n- **My Score:** 3 (We ate at (7,7) on the last move, so it's correct: 3 apples)\n- **Enemy Head:** (9,7) - Wait, the board shows \"0\" at (9,7), but the scoreboard says Snake #0 head is (9,7)? No, looking at the board state: Row 7 has \". A A . . A 1 T T 0\" which means (9,7) is Snake #0's head. And the scoreboard confirms Snake #0 head is (9,7). So they moved UP to (9,7) and ate the apple there! Their score is now 3, matching ours.\n\n**BOARD STATE CONFIRMATION:**\nFrom the visual:\n- Row 9: \". . . . . . . . . .\" - all empty\n- Row 8: \". A . . . . . . T .\" - (1,8) is Apple? No, row 8 says: \". A . . . . . . T .\" - wait, let me read it carefully:\n  - 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n  - 8 . A . . . . . . T .\n  - 7 . A A . .

A . . . . . . T\" - (6,6) is dot)\n   - Safe? Yes.\n   - Future options: DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6), UP (6,7)\n   - (5,6) is empty, (6,5) is empty, (7,6) is empty\n   - Also good mobility!\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (5, 7):**\n   - (5,7) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - Safe? Yes, it's an apple.\n   - Moving here gets me +1 score and grows my body!\n   - Future options: LEFT (4,7), UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), RIGHT (6,7)\n   - (4,7) is empty, (5,8) is empty, (5,6) is empty\n   - Excellent mobility AND I eat!\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7):**\n   - (7,7) is my body (specifically my body segment, the one that was my head last turn)\n   - This would be moving into my own body! CRASH! \u274c\n   - DEAD move!\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- RIGHT is instant death into my own body.\n\n**RANKING SAFE MOVES:**\n\n**3rd - UP to (6,8):** \nSafe, decent options, but doesn't grab an apple or gain immediate advantage.\n\n**2nd - DOWN to (6,6):**\nSafe, good options, but same as UP - no immediate gain.\n\n**1st - LEFT to (5,7):** \ud83c\udfc6 **THE WINNER!**\n- **APPLE ATTACK!** I eat the apple at (5,7) - score becomes 4-3 over the enemy!\n- **FOUR SAFE OPTIONS** from (5,7): LEFT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT - perfect mobility!\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm moving deeper into left-center, which is apple-rich territory (apples at (4,3), (5,7) I'm eating, (3,2), etc.)\n- **ENEMY POSITION:** Snake #0 is at (9,7) on far right. They're eating apples on the right edge. I need to outpace them!\n- **STRATEGY:** With the score 3-3, eating this apple gives me the lead again (4-3). The enemy has apples at (9,3), (8,0), (9,3) they might go for. But I'm taking the left-center zone and growing. From (5,7) I can access multiple apples and control the board while they're stuck on the right edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"After grabbing this apple at (5,7) and taking a 4-3 lead, I'll scout for the next apple to eat. The apples at (4,3), (3,2), or (2,6)/(2,7) are accessible from the left-center. Meanwhile, I'll position to force the enemy into the right corner. If they come left, I have space to maneuver. Let's keep the pressure on and extend the lead! CHAT, WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT!\"\n\n**THE CALL:** LEFT to (5,7) - EAT THE APPLE, GROW, AND TAKE THE LEAD! LET'S GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

CRASH! \n- RIGHT is off board!\n\nSo the enemy ONLY has safe moves: LEFT (if I'm not there? Wait, (8,8) is MY BODY, so they die if they go left) or UP to (9,9). If they go UP, they're trapped in the corner!\n\n**WAIT - CRITICAL REALIZATION:** \nIf I move UP to (5, 8) or DOWN to (5, 6) or LEFT to (4, 7), I'm keeping (8, 8) as my body. The enemy at (9, 8) going LEFT to (8, 8) would DIE!

We're up 4-3 and the enemy snake is literally cornered with his head at (8, 9)! Last turn I moved UP to (5, 9), securing the top row and putting myself in prime chasing position! Now let's analyze this board!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (5, 9) - Sitting pretty on the top row! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **My Body:** [(5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 7)] - Solid wall of body blocking the left side!\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 9) - CORNERED! Only exits: LEFT (7, 9) or DOWN (8, 8)!\n- **Enemy Body:** [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7)] - Still stuck on the right edge!\n- **MY PREDICAMENT:** From (5, 9), I have 3 safe moves: DOWN (5, 8) [own body], LEFT (4, 9), RIGHT (6, 9). UP would be off board (5, 10) - DEATH!\n\n**MOVES FROM MY HEAD (5, 9):**\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4, 9):**\n- Check board: Row 9 = \". . . . . 1 . . 0 T\" (enemy at 8,9)\n- (4, 9) is EMPTY! Safe!\n- This moves me TOWARD the enemy! If they go LEFT to (7, 9), I'm getting closer!\n- From (4, 9), I can go DOWN (4, 8) [empty], RIGHT (5, 9) [previous], LEFT (3, 9) [empty].\n- **MOBILITY:** Good options all around!\n- **PRESSURE:** Chasing them down the top row!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9):**\n- (6, 9) is EMPTY! Safe!\n- This moves me CLOSER to the enemy head! If they go LEFT to (7, 9), I could potentially cut them off or force collision next turn!\n- From (6, 9), I can go DOWN (6, 8) [empty], LEFT (5, 9) [previous], RIGHT (7, 9) [might be enemy!]\n- **MOBILITY:** Good but (7, 9) might become contested!\n- **DANGER:** If enemy goes LEFT to (7, 9) and I go RIGHT to (6, 9), we're adjacent but not colliding... yet.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5, 8):**\n- (5, 8) is MY BODY (the segment after head)! \u274c\n- Moving BACKWARDS into own body = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**UP \u2192 (5, 10):**\n- Off the board! DEATH! \u274c\n- **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (CRITICAL!):**\nFrom their head at (8, 9), their options:\n- **LEFT to (7, 9):** (7, 9) is EMPTY! This is their SURVIVAL move! If they go here, they escape the corner!\n- **DOWN to (8, 8):** (8, 8) is EMPTY! This also survives but stays on right side!\n- **RIGHT to (9, 9):** Their own body! CRASH! They die instantly! \ud83c\udfc6\n- **UP:** Off board! CRASH! They die instantly! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSo they have 2 SAFE moves and 2 SUICIDAL moves. They'll likely go LEFT to (7, 9) to survive and get away from the corner!\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\nIf they go LEFT to (7, 9):\n- From (7, 9), they can go LEFT (6, 9), DOWN (7, 8), or RIGHT (8, 9).\n- (6, 9) might become MY spot if I move RIGHT this turn!\n- This creates a potential head-on collision scenario if we both move toward the same spot!\n\nIf they go DOWN to (8, 8):\n- From (8, 8), they can go LEFT (7, 8), DOWN (8, 7), or RIGHT (9, 8) [their body!].\n- This gives them some breathing room but keeps them on the right side!\n\n**MOVES RANKING:**\n\n**2nd - LEFT to (4, 9):** \n- Safe and moves toward the enemy.\n- But gives them more space if they go LEFT to (7, 9).\n- Less immediate pressure!\n\n**1st - RIGHT to (6, 9):** \ud83c\udfc6 **THE WINNING PLAY!**\n- **MAXIMUM PRESSURE:** If enemy goes LEFT to (7, 9), I'm at (6, 9) - ADJACENT! Next turn I can potentially force a head-on collision if I have the score advantage (I DO: 4-3)!\n- **CHASING POWER:** I'm getting CLOSER to their escape route!\n- **MOBILITY:** From (6, 9), I have: DOWN (6, 8) [empty], LEFT (5, 9) [my previous], RIGHT (7, 9) [contested if they go left].\n- **BOARD CONTROL:** I own the top row! The enemy is running out of space!\n- **SCENARIO PLANNING:**\n  * If they go LEFT to (7, 9): I'm at (6, 9) - Next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 9) for a head-on collision! Since I have 4 apples vs their 3, I WIN THE COLLISION! \ud83c\udfc6\n  * If they go DOWN to (8, 8): They're still trapped on the right side! I can continue chasing or pivot to apples!\n  * If they CRASH into themselves: WE WIN IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n\"Perfect! Moving RIGHT to (6, 9) puts me RIGHT in their escape path! If they go LEFT to (7, 9), I'm adjacent and ready to force a collision next turn with my score advantage! If they go DOWN, they're still trapped and I can adjust. This is maximum aggression - cutting off their escape and putting them in a CHECKMATE position! They either die to their own body this turn or face a head-on collision next turn where they LOSE because I have more apples! CHAT, THIS IS GAME OVER! They have NO GOOD MOVES! Let's see if they choke or try to run! Either way, we're winning this!\"\n\n**THE CALL:** RIGHT to (6, 9) - CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE, FORCE THE COLLISION, END THE GAME! LET'S GOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down this turn!\n\n**TURN 11 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE:**\n- **Head:** (6, 9) - I just moved here last turn! CHAT, WE GOT ADJACENT! \n- **Body:** [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)] - Solid formation on the left!\n- **Apples:** 4 - LEADING by 1!\n\n**ENEMY STATE:**\n- **Head:** (7, 9) - THEY WENT LEFT! They're panicking!\n- **Body:** [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)] - Still trapped on the right!\n- **Apples:** 3 - TRAILING!\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nWE ARE LITERALLY ADJACENT! My head at (6,9) and their head at (7,9) - only ONE CELL APART! This is CHECKMATE territory!\n\n**MOVES FROM MY HEAD (6, 9):**\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9):** \n- (7, 9) IS WHERE THE ENEMY HEAD IS RIGHT NOW!\n- This would be a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \n- We both move simultaneously - they'll choose a move too!\n- If they go LEFT to (6, 9), we swap places! \n- If they go DOWN to (7, 8), I'd move into (7, 9) which becomes empty! \n- If they go UP or RIGHT (suicide), they die anyway!\n- **THE BEAUTY:** If they go LEFT to (6, 9) while I go RIGHT to (7, 9), we literally SWAP positions! I get their spot, they get mine! \n- BUT WAIT - if they go LEFT to (6, 9) and I go RIGHT to (7, 9), there's NO collision because we're moving into each other's CURRENT positions!\n- This is actually SAFE! We'd just exchange spots! \n- **THE REAL DANGER:** If they go DOWN to (7, 8) while I go RIGHT to (7, 9), we're both alive! But from (7, 9), I have more control!\n- **SCORE ADVANTAGE:** If there's a head-on collision into the SAME cell, MY SCORE WINS! But this move doesn't guarantee collision...\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (5, 9):**\n- (5, 9) is MY BODY! \u274c DEAD! Moving back into my own segment!\n- **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**UP \u2192 (6, 10):**\n- Off the board! DEATH! \u274c\n- **ELIMINATED!**\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (6, 8):**\n- Check board: Row 8 = \". A . . . T . . . T\" (my body at 5,8)\n- (6, 8) is EMPTY! Safe!\n- This moves me DOWN while they're at (7, 9)!\n- From (6, 8), I can go: LEFT (5, 8) [my body!], RIGHT (7, 8) [empty!], DOWN (6, 7) [my body!], UP (6, 9) [previous]\n- Wait, (6, 7) is MY BODY! So actually only RIGHT is truly safe? No...\n- Actually from (6, 8): LEFT (5, 8) is MY BODY, DOWN (6, 7) is MY BODY, UP (6, 9) is previous, RIGHT (7, 8) is empty.\n- So (6, 8) would leave me with ONLY ONE SAFE EXIT (RIGHT)! That's a TRAP!\n\n**THE REAL STRATEGY:**\n\nFrom (6, 9), I have:\n- RIGHT (7, 9): Enemy head location NOW, but they'll move!\n- DOWN (6, 8): Leads to being trapped (only one exit)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 9):\n- **SCENARIO 1:** Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 9) \u2192 We SWAP! I end at (7, 9), they end at (6, 9). From (7, 9), I'm now blocking their escape to the left and controlling more space!\n- **SCENARIO 2:** Enemy goes DOWN to (7, 8) \u2192 I end at (7, 9), they at (7, 8). We're VERTICAL! From (7, 9), I can go DOWN (7, 8) next turn - that's where they'd be! Potential collision!\n- **SCENARIO 3:** Enemy goes RIGHT (9, 9) or UP (7, 10) \u2192 They die anyway!\n\n**THE CALCULATION:**\nIf I go RIGHT and they go LEFT, we SWAP! I get the \"better\" position at (7, 9) because I'm now MORE to their right, making it harder for them to escape rightwards!\n\nIf I go RIGHT and they go DOWN, I'm at (7, 9) with options: LEFT (6, 9), DOWN (7, 8), RIGHT (8, 9). They'd be at (7, 8). Next turn I can CHASE!\n\n**THE KILLER MOVE:**\nActually wait... let me think about THIS turn's collision rules more carefully...\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 9) and they go LEFT to (6, 9), are we colliding? NO! Because we're moving into each other's CURRENT positions simultaneously. That's a SWAP - both survive!\n\nIf I go RIGHT and they also go RIGHT (to 8, 9), I'd be at (7, 9) and they at (8, 9) - no collision!\n\nThe ONLY way collision happens is if we BOTH try to move into the SAME NEW cell at the same time.\n\nSo... what if I go RIGHT and they go LEFT? Swap! What if I go RIGHT and they go DOWN? I'm at (7, 9), they at (7, 8).\n\n**BUT CHAT, I HAVE A BETTER IDEA!**\n\nWhat if I DON'T chase directly? What if I go DOWN to (6, 8)? No wait, that traps me...\n\n**THE ACTUAL WINNING PLAY:**\n\nI need to think about what THEY think I'll do! They're at (7, 9) and I'm at (6, 9). They're scared!\n\nIf I go RIGHT, they might think I'm coming for them and go DOWN to avoid me!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nGo RIGHT to (7, 9) - force them to react! If they go LEFT to (6, 9), we SWAP and I'm now at their old spot (7, 9), which is actually BETTER for me because I'm closer to the right edge! If they go DOWN, I'm at (7, 9) ready to chase!\n\nBut wait... if they go LEFT and I go RIGHT, we SWAP. That means I end up at (7, 9) and they end up at (6, 9). Now THEY have MY old spot! That's not necessarily better for me...\n\n**RETHINKING:**\n\nActually, from (6, 9), if I go DOWN to (6, 8), that seems bad (trapped). \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 9) and they go LEFT to (6, 9), we swap. Then they're at (6, 9) with body behind them at (5, 9). From (6, 9), they can go DOWN (6, 8) [empty], LEFT (5, 9) [their body], RIGHT (7, 9) [me], UP (6, 10) [death]. So they'd be trapped too!\n\n**THE REAL STRATEGY:**\nForce them into a corner! Go RIGHT to (7, 9)! If they go LEFT to (6, 9), we swap but they're now more trapped! If they go DOWN, I control the top row!\n\n**THE CALL:**\nGO RIGHT! AGGRESSIVE PRESSURE! Force them to make a mistake!\n\nRIGHT",
