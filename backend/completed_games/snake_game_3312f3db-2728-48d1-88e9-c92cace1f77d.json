Your head at (3,6) is not adjacent to (3,2) in any direction, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nThus, all four directions are safe.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (6,5), which is 3 rows down and 3 columns left from your head (3,6). This is a long distance, so we need to consider how to approach it safely.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid getting trapped**: Since your snake is just a single head, you should avoid moving into a position where you could be blocked by the enemy or the board in future turns.\n2. **Prioritize safety over immediate apple gain**: Since the closest apple is far away, we should focus on creating a path to it while avoiding collisions.\n3. **Expand body segments**: Since you have no body segments, you should grow by eating an apple to create a body and future options.\n4. **Avoid direct paths that could be blocked**: Moving directly towards (6,5) might be blocked by the enemy snake or the board.\n\n### Move Analysis:\n- **UP**: Move to (3,5). This is a safe move and moves you closer to the apple at (6,5) vertically.\n- **DOWN**: Move to (4,6). This is also safe but moves you horizontally closer to the apple at (6,5).\n- **LEFT**: Move to (2,6). This is safe but moves you away from the apple at (6,5) horizontally.\n- **RIGHT**: Move to (4,6). Same as DOWN.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, UP is slightly better because it moves you closer to the apple vertically, which is a more direct path towards the apple at (6,5).\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Turn 1**: Move UP to (3,5).\n- **Turn 2**: From (3,5), move UP to (3,4) or DOWN to (4,5) to continue moving towards the apple at (6,5).\n- **Turn 3**: Continue moving towards the apple while expanding the body segments by eating apples.\n\n### Enemy Consideration:\n- The enemy snake is at (3,2). It will also move this turn. We should avoid moving into a position where it could potentially block our path in the future.\n\n### Final Decision:\nUP\n\n---",

The closest apple is (6,5), but it\u2019s far away (distance 3 in both x and y). Instead, I should aim for an apple that\u2019s closer but still safe to eat in the next few turns, while expanding my body to block enemy paths.\n2. **Apple Selection:** The next best apple to eat is (8,4) or (0,0), but they\u2019re farther. The next closest is (8,8), which is diagonally distant (distance 5). However, (8,4) is only 5 rows down and 5 columns left from my current head (3,6), which is a longer diagonal path. Instead, I should focus on (6,5) but move incrementally to avoid being blocked.\n3. **Safety First:** The enemy snake is at (2,2). If I move UP to (3,5), I avoid immediate collision but must ensure the enemy doesn\u2019t block my path. The enemy\u2019s next move could be UP to (2,3), LEFT to (1,2), or RIGHT to (3,2). If it moves RIGHT to (3,2), it could block my path to (6,5) if I later move DOWN to (4,6) or (5,6).\n4. **Move Prioritization:** Moving UP to (3,5) is safe and keeps me on a vertical path toward (6,5). If the enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, it won\u2019t immediately block me.

Apples at (9,5), (0,0), (8,8), (8,4), (6,5).\n**Enemy:** Single snake at (1,2).\n\n**Key Goals:**\n1. **Prioritize (6,5) and (8,4)** as immediate targets\u2014they are closest and require fewer turns to reach than (0,0) or (8,8).\n2. **Avoid enemy head (1,2) blocking my path**\u2014especially if it moves RIGHT to (3,2) or UP to (2,3).\n3. **Expand vertically** to maximize future movement options (e.g., toward (6,5) or (8,4)).\n4. **If enemy moves aggressively**, pivot to defensive paths (e.g., LEFT toward (0,0) if (3,2) becomes a threat).\n\n**Next 3 Turns:**\n- **Turn 1:** Move UP to (3,7) \u2192 Keeps vertical alignment toward (6,5).\n- **Turn 2:** Move DOWN to (4,7) \u2192 Closer to (6,5) or (8,4).\n- **Turn 3:** Evaluate enemy position; if safe, move LEFT to (3,7) or RIGHT to (5,7) to test paths.\n\n---\n### **Current Analysis & Safe Moves**\n**Your snake:**\n- Head: (3,7)\n- Body: None\n- Apples: 0\n\n**Enemy snake:**\n- Head: (1,2)\n\n**Apples:**\n- (9,5), (0,0), (8,8), (8,4), (6,5)\n\n**Board state:**\n```\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . .

          "rationale": "Reasoning:\n- Current head is at (0,2). Left would be off-board, so it is not an option. Safe options are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), or RIGHT to (1,2). There is no body to collide with, and the enemy head at (3,9) is far away this turn.\n- The nearest apple is at (0,0). Moving DOWN now brings me closer to that apple along the same column, making a straightforward path: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0).\n- UP would move away from any immediate apple, and RIGHT would stray from the vertical path to (0,0). So DOWN is the most sensible choice to maximize a safe apple collection this turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (0,1) this turn, then DOWN again to (0,0) to eat the apple and grow.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After securing (0,0), continue to assess the best path to remaining apples (e.g., (6,5), (8,4), (8,8), (9,5)) while keeping ample space to maneuver and watching for potential head-on collisions with the enemy. Maintain openness to detour if the enemy approaches.\n\nDOWN",
