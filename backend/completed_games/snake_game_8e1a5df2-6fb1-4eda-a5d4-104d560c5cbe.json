Still, it wouldn\u2019t move us towards the nearby apple at (3,2).\n\u2022 Moving LEFT will take us to (4,3).

Moving RIGHT moves us toward the right side of the board where several apples lie \u2013 in particular, the apple at (9,3) and eventually the one at (6,5).

Since our goal is to grow and score points quickly, moving RIGHT seems promising. It takes us closer horizontally toward the apples at (6,5) and further to the one at (9,3), allowing us a good mix of horizontal and vertical options on subsequent moves.\n\nMy strategy for upcoming moves is to continue making progress toward those apples while being cautious of our own body and avoiding the enemy snake (which is still far off).\n\nThus, my next move is: RIGHT."

Let me consider my apple targeting:\n\nThe enemy snake head is now at (2, 8) and could potentially reach the apple at (2, 9) very quickly - just one move UP. This makes that apple less attractive.\n\nThe apple at (7, 8) is behind my body position and would require significant maneuvering around my own tail, which seems inefficient.\n\nMy best targets remain the western apples at (0, 5) and (0, 3). I'm currently 5 moves away from (0, 5) and 5 moves away from (0, 3) if I go directly.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position and body, it's currently focused on the upper portion of the board. The enemy body occupies y=6 from x=2 to x=6, which creates a barrier, but I'm below that at y=4.\n\n**Decision considerations:**\n- If I go UP to (5, 5), I get closer to the apple at (0, 5) and move toward the enemy's body level, but I'm still safe\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 3), I move toward the apple at (0, 3) and stay in lower territory away from the enemy\n- If I go LEFT to (4, 4), I continue progressing west but stay at the same y-level\n\nGoing UP to (5, 5) seems optimal because:\n1. It moves me toward the apple at (0, 5)\n2. I'll be at y=5, which gives me flexibility to go to either (0, 5) or drop down toward (0, 3) if needed\n3. The enemy snake at (2, 8) would need several moves to interfere with my path to (0, 5)\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving UP, continue west toward (0, 5) unless the enemy snake shows signs of moving toward that area. Keep monitoring the enemy's movement pattern to see if it goes for (2, 9) or changes direction.\n\nUP"

The enemy snake body extends along y=6 from x=2 to x=6, which means (5, 6) is blocked by the enemy. I also can't go back down to my own body.\n\n**Safe move analysis:**\nOnly LEFT to (4, 5) and RIGHT to (6, 5) are safe options.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Going LEFT to (4, 5) continues my westward progression toward the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 3)\n- Going RIGHT to (6, 5) would move me away from my target apples and closer to my own tail area\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 9) is likely going for the apple at (7, 8) or might continue expanding in the upper area. Going LEFT keeps me progressing toward the western apples while staying safe.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** After moving LEFT, continue west toward (0, 5). I need to be very careful about the enemy snake's body positioning along y=6, which creates a barrier I need to navigate around.

The apple at (0, 5) is only 2 moves away if I continue LEFT\n2. It's the closest apple and on the same horizontal line\n3.

After collecting it, I should consider going for the apple at (0, 3) which will be just 2 moves down, or reassess based on the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy snake appears to be staying in the upper portion of the board, so my path along y=5 should remain safe.\n\nLEFT"

For instance, from (6,9) we can later head RIGHT to (7,9) or even DOWN to (6,8), setting us up for an accessible approach toward the apple at (7,8).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,8) would be safe but would drop our snake\u2019s head into a lower row. Keeping our head near the top provides more open space and flexibility for future moves. There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes, and our path via RIGHT maintains board control while progressing toward our target apple.\n\nThus, after evaluating our safe movement options and considering our goal, I decide our next move should be: RIGHT."

Both UP and DOWN are open\u2014but by moving DOWN to (9,7), we position ourselves a bit lower (closer in vertical distance to (4,6)) while maintaining ample maneuverability.\n3.

Calculating Manhattan distances to the apple at (4,6):\n\u2003\u2022 If we go UP to (8,6): distance = |8\u20134| + |6\u20136| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\u2003\u2022 If we go LEFT to (7,5): distance = |7\u20134| + |5\u20136| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\u2003\u2022 If we go DOWN to (8,4): distance = |8\u20134| + |4\u20136| = 4 + 2 = 6.\nThus, UP and LEFT are equally good in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\n3. Now checking the board and positions:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (8,6) is safe and keeps us clear of our body and enemy snake.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT to (7,5) is also safe. Additionally, moving left reduces our horizontal difference from the apple (from 8\u21927; apple\u2019s x is 4) so it directly helps us close that gap.\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN is farther away from the target.\n\n4. With both UP and LEFT being safe and equally reducing the distance, I\u2019ll prioritize LEFT because it moves us directly toward the apple along the x-axis.\n\nNext turn, I plan to continue charting a path that step\u2010by\u2010step brings our head closer to (4,6) while avoiding obstacles. \n\nFinal choice: LEFT."

This horizontal progress can be preferable in maneuvering around future obstacles.\n\nStrategically, it's good to head toward the target apple while ensuring you maintain safe distance from both your own body and enemy snake positions. On the next turn, continue checking adjacent cells for safety and keep a clear route toward the remaining apples. \n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
