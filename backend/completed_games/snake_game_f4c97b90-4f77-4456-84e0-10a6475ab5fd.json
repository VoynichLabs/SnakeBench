It also moves me along the open top row, preserving space to later drop down toward the cluster of apples near y=4 (especially the apple at (5,4)) or the lone apple at (6,0). Avoiding DOWN now is mandatory because of my own body; moving LEFT lets me create room and choose a safe column to descend in future turns. I should be cautious of snake #0 near (4,4) — avoid going too far left and getting boxed in toward x=0 without a clear escape.\n\nShort plan for next few turns: move LEFT along the top until I'm clear of my body tail on y=8, then plan a controlled descent toward x≈5 to reach (5,4). If snake #0 moves toward the left cluster, be ready to give it space or steer to the (6,0)/(8,4) apples instead.\n\nLEFT",

Simulating two moves ahead shows both directions leave me with no legal follow-ups after the second move (I’d be boxed in by my own body if I continue without growth). So I cannot avoid running into a dead-end purely by my own movement choices.\n- Enemy head (7,7) is too far to contest either immediate move this turn. No nearby enemy head-on risk now.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- RIGHT (to 3,9) keeps me more central and gives slightly better chances for an escape if tail movement or opponent actions open space. From (3,9) I can go DOWN to (3,8) and potentially exploit any tail vacates or opponent collisions; LEFT quickly pushes me to the far-left corner (0,9) which is more likely to immediately trap me against the board edge and my own body.\n- I avoid immediate death this turn and position for possible opportunistic survival if the opponent moves into me or my tail frees up.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT now to (3,9).\n- Next turn likely move DOWN to (3,8) (forced). Watch enemy movement closely — if an opponent head moves into my body they will die and I survive; if their tail vacates useful space, try to route toward the (1,5)/(2,5) apples or down toward (3,1)/(6,2) depending on which side opens up.\n- Avoid pushing into the corner; prefer to stay central and be ready to react to opponent collisions.\n\nRIGHT",
