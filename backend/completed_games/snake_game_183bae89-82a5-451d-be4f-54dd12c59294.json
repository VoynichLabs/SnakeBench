The apple at (6, 4) will be a good opportunity to grow and score some points.\n\nMy next strategy should involve carefully positioning myself near the apple and then directionally moving to catch it, making sure to avoid all potential dangers, like the enemy snake or any walls that might pop up on the board.\n\nWait, my snake's ID is 1 and its head is at (8, 9) at the moment. Considering my overall strategy of going diagonally down to the left first before finding a precise route, I'll plan more accurately during the next turn based on the snake movements and board situations.\n\nFirst, my current goal is to move towards the apple at (6, 4) by going down, then the next turn, I can reassess the situation and fine-tune my path accordingly.\n\nSince I initially determined that I will move diagonally down and then reassess the situation after that, my next move will aim to approach the apple at a more contrasting angle. So, I'll decLine the y coordinate first to (7, 9) then will reassess the best possible route to (6, 4).\n\nTime to think... Alright!
