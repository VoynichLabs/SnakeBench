Since apple y is 6, and current y is 2, moving up helps get closer.\n\nSafety check for UP:\n\n- (7,3) is within bounds.\n- No snake or apple occupies (7,3). It's free.\n\nSafety for LEFT:\n\n- (6,2) within bounds.\n- No snake or apple occupies (6,2) - board shows '.' there.\n\nEither move is safe.\n\nGiven that, moving UP makes more sense to approach the apple vertically.\n\nPotential strategy: after moving UP, we can keep moving UP until y=6, then move LEFT toward x=5, getting to apple at (5,6).\n\nHence, next move: UP.\n\n---\n\n**Next move:** UP",

That cell was recently occupied by my own body at last move, but since I moved down from (3,5), the tail has moved forward? Let's see. The snake just grew, so the tail does not move this turn. So originally the snake's body was a set of segments behind the head. After eating, the snake grows, so no tail movement. So the cell (3,5) is now occupied by my own body, so moving UP would be moving into myself → death.\n\n- DOWN to (3,3)? This is empty. Good.\n\n- LEFT to (2,4)? Empty. Good.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4)?

No.\n\nIs going DOWN or LEFT more beneficial?\n\nI will pick DOWN, since it continues the downward trajectory, keeps distance from my own body higher, and keeps options open.\n\nMove: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n\nProceed toward apple (2,2), then after that (2,7), (0,7), (0,9), and (5,9) in order of distance, maximizing apple collection.\n\nAvoid moving upwards into my own body at (3,5) to prevent death.\n\n---\n\nMove: DOWN",

However, moving **DOWN to (4, 5)** allows me to further explore the space for potential future moves as I establish a stronger base from which to move toward the upper part of the board where more apples are clustered.\n\n### Short-Term Strategy:\n1. Focus on moving to areas that remain unoccupied while checking for apples.\n2. Always consider the presence of enemy snakes and avoid areas that lead to collision.\n3. Gradually navigate toward apples without rushing since the area is currently controlled by enemy presence.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nGiven the analysis above, I will move **DOWN** to (4, 5). \n\nDecided next move: **DOWN**.",

So the snake length would stay the same, and the tail moves forward.\n\n---\n\n### Occupied spaces:\n\nOur snake occupies (1,2) (head), then previous segments that shift forward; so the tail moves off by one.\n\nWe also have an enemy snake at (5,6).\n\n---\n\n### Apple positions remaining:\n\n- (0,9), (0,7), (2,7), (5,9), (5,2)\n\n---\n\n### Immediate neighbors from (1,2):\n\n- UP: (1,3)\n- DOWN: (1,1)\n- LEFT: (0,2)\n- RIGHT: (2,2)\n\nIs any of these occupied by our body or an enemy?\n\n- (2,2) was our previous head - now vacated (assuming tail moved), so probably free.\n\n- (1,3), (1,1), (0,2) seem free based on previous body positions.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic thoughts:\n\nThe apple cluster we want is mostly upwards and leftwards:\n\n- (0,9), (0,7), and (2,7)\n\nMoving UP to (1,3) is good for heading up.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,2) starts heading towards x=0 column.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,2) is backtracking somewhat.\n\nDown (1,1) is away from apples.\n\n---\n\n### Check safety:\n\n- Cannot move directly backwards to (2,2) if that is our previous head? Actually, in snake games, moving into the segment just behind your head is usually forbidden to prevent reversing into yourself. Since our head is at (1,2) and previous head was (2,2), moving RIGHT (to 2,2) would be moving backwards into our body segment, which is not allowed.\n\n- So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\n- So from (1,2), possible moves safe now: UP (1,3), LEFT (0,2), DOWN (1,1).\n\n---\n\n### Choosing next move:\n\n- From (1,2), moving UP takes us closer to (1,3), then likely UP again toward (1,7), which approaches the cluster.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (0,2) moves us closer to column 0, but that is more sideways than up.\n\n- Moving DOWN goes away from apples.\n\nTherefore, **UP** is the best next step.\n\n---\n\n### Next strategy:\n\nAim to move UP along column 1 toward these apples, then over to column 0, or up to (2,7).\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**",

The apples nearby are at (0,9), (0,7), (5,9), (2,7), and (5,2).\n\nLooking at the position:\n\n- Moving UP (1,5) is likely clear; you gain more height, approaching apples at row 7 and 9.\n- Moving LEFT (0,4) brings you closer in the x-direction to left side apples (0,7) and (0,9).\n- Moving RIGHT (2,4) is possible but the body extends to (2,2) and further; you need to check if this means collision risk (not immediate, but risky).\n- Moving DOWN (1,3) is moving backward onto your own body (or at minimum to the position your body will occupy next). So avoid this.\n\nCheck if moving UP (1,5) is safe (no body or snake there). Your body occupies (1,3), (1,2), so (1,5) is free. The enemy snake is at (5,8) with no body.\n\nIt would be best to continue going UP to maximize height and get closer to clusters of apples at y=7 and y=9.\n\nThis matches the last strategy, which seems effective.\n\nDecide move: UP.\n\nTune strategy for next turn:\n- When reaching higher rows (y >=7), shift horizontally towards apples at x=0 or x=2.\n- Avoid moving onto yourself or the enemy.\n\nNext move: UP",

They are not in direct proximity to my current position, so I do not face an immediate threat.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 9):\n1. **UP to (4, 10)**: This move is off the board, resulting in death.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 8)**: This would not be beneficial as it retraces my steps and does not provide scoring.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 9)**: This square is unoccupied and moves me further away from the apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 9)**: This would move back onto my previous position and would simply revert, which is again not beneficial.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **UP to (4, 10)**: Invalid move (off the board).\n- **DOWN to (4, 8)**: Backtracking to an earlier position without gaining points, not useful.\n- **LEFT to (3, 9)**: An unoccupied move but moves me closer to the edge without scoring.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 9)**: This is essentially revisiting a previous spot, which is not strategic.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nGiven that the only moves of value involve the potential to move toward collecting apples, I need to reconsider my approach in terms of position. Since moving directly for immediate scoring isn't possible, I'll weigh my options:\n\n- **Moving LEFT to (3, 9)** puts me one step toward positioning for future apples, even if it takes me slightly away from my initial apple chase. It helps maintain a strategic presence on the board.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe logical next move is to go **LEFT to (3, 9)**, as it gives me more options on the following turn and keeps me from backtracking or moving out of bounds.\n\nDecided next move: **LEFT**.",

Moving **RIGHT** to (3,9):\n   - Opens route along the top row (row 9).\n   - Can advance toward apples clustered on right side at (5,2), (6,6), (7,2), and (8,2).\n   - You won't immediately reach an apple, but this positioning is useful for upcoming moves.\n   - No immediate threat there; your body mostly occupies left side.\n\n2. Moving **DOWN** to (2,8):\n   - Brings you closer to apple at (0,7).\n   - However, enemy snake occupies (2,7) and (2,6), which means going down further along x=2 is risky because of enemy presence.\n   - May get trapped or blocked if enemy moves aggressively or snakes block the path.\n\n---\n\n### Safe path and strategic logic:\n\n- Moving **RIGHT** is safer and opens up more options, avoids conflict with the enemy snake on the column 2 below you.\n- Moving **RIGHT** next turn allows checking availability of apples on right.\n- You can plan a path downward afterward to approach apples.\n\n---\n\n### Final decision:\n\n- Move **RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n### Next turn strategy reminder to self:\n\n- After moving right, assess enemy movement.\n- Try to approach and collect apples on right side of the board.\n- Avoid getting boxed in by your own body or enemy on column 2.\n- Keep an eye on snake 1 movements and avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**",

It provides additional mobility while keeping a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- **Going UP to (4, 7)** could make me vulnerable if the enemy chooses to move downward. It also doesn’t progress towards any apples.\n- **Going DOWN to (4, 5)** does nothing to advance towards the apples as well.\n- **Going RIGHT to (5, 6)** seems to be the best option, allowing for more movement opportunities in upcoming turns while steering clear of immediate threats.\n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering my current situation, to enhance mobility and position myself strategically towards upcoming apples, I will make the following move:\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**.",
