We're facing down Snake #0, and it's time to set the tone! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\nMy head is at (0, 4). Snake #0's head is at (5, 0).\nThe board is 10x10. We both have length 1, so no body to worry about yet, just walls and the opponent's head.\n\n**Objective:**\nGrab apples, grow, and box in the rival. Since we are both short, we need to spread out, grab some real estate, and start looking for opportunities to dominate the center.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (0, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):** Safe. Moves me towards an apple at (2, 1) and (0, 9) eventually, but more importantly, expands my territory vertically on the left edge.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 3):** Safe. Keeps me on the edge.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Safe. Moves me towards the center and apples at (4, 4), (3, 4), and (7, 4). This is the most aggressive move towards the central action.\n4.  **LEFT to (-1, 4):** DANGER! Off the board. Eliminate.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (1, 4):** This takes me off the wall. Usually a good strategic move early on to gain flexibility. It positions me closer to the first apple drops: (2, 1) and (5, 4).\n*   **UP (0, 5):** Keeps me safe on the wall, good for a defensive start, but limits my options for the next turn.\n*   **DOWN (0, 3):** Similar to UP, defensive and limiting.\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 0). Where is he likely to go? He's probably going UP toward the center/apples, or maybe exploring RIGHT or LEFT along the bottom edge, but UP seems most natural. If he goes UP, he moves to (5, 1). If I go RIGHT, I move to (1, 4). We are still very far apart.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe need to gain ground quickly. Moving RIGHT gets me off the constrained edge and towards the action. The closest apple is (2, 1). Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) sets me up to maybe move DOWN-DOWN-RIGHT to get close to that apple, or continue RIGHT to the center.\n\nLet's prioritize getting into the main playing field and growing! RIGHT is the move that maximizes central influence this turn.\n\n**What about the first apple at (2, 1)?**\nFrom (0, 4):\n*   Going RIGHT to (1, 4) is 1 move. Then maybe DOWN (1, 3), DOWN (1, 2), RIGHT (2, 2), then DOWN (2, 1). That's 5 moves.\n*   Going DOWN to (0, 3), DOWN (0, 2), RIGHT (1, 2), RIGHT (2, 2), DOWN (2, 1). That's also 5 moves.\n\nGoing RIGHT (1, 4) gives me more immediate options for the next turn than staying on the wall. Plus, there are tons of apples in the middle/upper half that I want to contest.\n\nLet's break out of the starting corner and head for the action! RIGHT it is! Gotta be aggressive, that's what the stream wants, right Chat? \ud83d\udd25 We're going for the gold!\n\nRIGHT",

SAFE. \u2705\n   - **RIGHT:** (6, 0) - Board is empty there. SAFE. \u2705\n   - **DOWN:** (5, -1) - OFF THE BOARD. DEAD. \u274c\n   - **UP:** (5, 1) - Board has an apple at (5, 2) and (5, 4), but (5, 1) is empty. SAFE. \u2705\n\n2) **STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\n   - The enemy is at (0, 4). They're far away, but I need to dominate the center.\n   - **UP (5, 1)** positions me closer to the vertical line of apples at (5, 2) and (5, 4). This gives me growth potential and control of the center column.\n   - **LEFT (4, 0)** pushes me toward the edge, which is riskier long-term for trapping myself.\n   - **RIGHT (6, 0)** moves me away from the central apples and toward the right wall.\n\n3) **LONG-TERM PLAN:** \n   Grab the apple at (5, 2) next turn if I go UP. Once I grow, I'll have more reach to threaten the enemy's space and cut off their routes. The center is power! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP",

Time to dominate this board and box out snake #1! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break this down like a pro strategist:\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP:** (5, 2) - Currently has an apple! Safe move, and I'll grow by eating it. Perfect start. \u2705\n- **LEFT:** (4, 1) - Empty space, safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 1) - Empty space, safe. \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (5, 0) - Empty space, safe. \u2705\n\nAll four moves are technically safe right now since my body is empty and we're not hitting anything.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 4) - they're way over in the left-middle while I'm centrally positioned at (5, 1). I need to claim this vertical column (x=5) as MY territory. There's an apple RIGHT ABOVE ME at (5, 2)! Taking that immediately gives me a score lead and extends my reach toward the center.\n\nGoing UP secures:\n- Instant growth (+1 apple)\n- Control of the central column\n- Positioning between the two central apple clusters at (5, 4) and (5, 2)\n- Forces enemy to play around MY position\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 4). They'll probably go for apples or try to position themselves. I need to get bigger FIRST so I can cut off their routes later.\n\n**4) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (5, 2) \u2192 Control center \u2192 Cut off enemy access to apples \u2192 Force them into corners \u2192 Wait for them to crash or box them in completely.

How is my archrival Snake #0 looking?\n\n**Current Game State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (1, 4). Length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 1). Length 1.\n*   **Closest Apple:** (2, 1) is just a few moves away. (5, 4) is also tempting.\n\nThis is the phase where we establish board dominance and try to position ourselves for the first apple.\n\n**Where did ID 0 likely move?**\nLast turn, ID 0 was at (5, 0).\nNow they are at (5, 1). This means they moved **UP**. Exactly as predicted. They are aiming for the center/apples, or perhaps just positioning themselves safely.\n\n**Our Goal:**\nSecure the first apple, (2, 1), or cut off the enemy from the next big cluster of apples in the middle. We need to move from the relatively safe side wall into the middle area, focusing down and right.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (1, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward the upper half.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** Safe. This is a crucial move for reaching the apple at (2, 1).\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe. Moves us toward the center and the apple cluster at y=4, like (3, 4) and (4, 4).\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, but retreats back to the wall. Not great for board control.\n\n**Collision/Aggression Check:**\nWe are at (1, 4). The enemy is at (5, 1). We are far apart, so a head-on or side-swipe collision is impossible this turn. Our focus is pure positioning.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT):**\n\n*   **LEFT (0, 4):** Retreats. NO! We need to push!\n*   **UP (1, 5):** Good for securing the upper area, but moves us away from the closest apple (2, 1).\n*   **RIGHT (2, 4):** This is a strong centralizing move. It gets us one step closer to the apple at (5, 4), and still keeps (2, 1) moderately reachable.\n*   **DOWN (1, 3):** This is the direct route to the apple at (2, 1). From (1, 3), we are just 2-3 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nLet's look at the race for (2, 1).\n*   **My Path (DOWN):** (1, 4) -> (1, 3) (Turn 1 move) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1). I can grab it on Turn 4/5.\n*   **Enemy Path (from 5, 1):** They need to head LEFT/DOWN. Assuming they continue UP to (5, 2) or LEFT to (4, 1):\n    *   If they go LEFT to (4, 1): -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1). They could grab it on Turn 3. **WAIT A MINUTE!** They are closer!\n\nThis changes everything! Snake #0 at (5, 1) is only 3 moves (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT) or (LEFT, DOWN, LEFT) or (LEFT, LEFT, UP) away from (2, 1). My optimal route is 4-5 moves. If they commit to it, they get the apple.\n\n**New Strategy: Contest the Center/Upper Apple (5, 4)!**\nSince we are likely to lose the race for (2, 1), we pivot aggressively toward the center. (5, 4) is our new target.\n\nHow far are we from (5, 4)?\n*   Me (1, 4): 4 moves (3 RIGHT moves, 0 UP/DOWN).\n*   Them (5, 1): 3 moves (3 UP moves, 0 LEFT/RIGHT).\n\nIt's a tie/too close to call, depending on their move! If they go UP to (5, 2), they are set up for (5, 4) on Turn 3. If I go RIGHT, I am at (2, 4).\n\nLet's go RIGHT to (2, 4). This move is multipurpose:\n1.  It positions us in the central column cluster (x=2, 3, 4).\n2.  It sets us up to potentially cut them off if they try to switch to the left side unexpectedly.\n3.  It puts us on the direct path to (5, 4).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (2, 4)**: Next turn I can move RIGHT to (3, 4) (apple!), then RIGHT to (4, 4) (apple!). We could potentially grab two apples quickly and deny them two central spots! This looks like a better use of our positioning. We prioritize guaranteed apples (or blocking) over a contested one.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 1: RIGHT to (2, 4).\n2.  Turn 2: RIGHT to (3, 4) (Apple!).\n3.  Turn 3: RIGHT to (4, 4) (Apple!).\n\nThis strategy ensures immediate growth and board presence in the center. Let the enemy have (2, 1) if they want it; we're grabbing two central apples and setting up for domination!\n\nWe're going aggressive and opportunistic, CHAT! We're denying the center, not chasing the opponent's choice!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 grabbed the apple at (2, 1) and is now at (5, 2) with a tail at (5, 1). They got 1 apple already. Time to catch up!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n*   **My Head (ID 1):** (2, 4). Length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (5, 2). Body: [(5, 1)]. Length 2.\n*   **Immediate Targets:** We are right next to the apple at (3, 4) and (4, 4)! EZ CONTENT!\n\n**Where did ID 0 move?**\nLast turn, ID 0 was at (5, 1). Now they are at (5, 2). They moved **UP**. This means they claimed their first apple and are now trying to push towards the center or the upper apples like (5, 4). They are not chasing us right now. Good.\n\n**Our Goal:**\nExecute the plan! Grab the central apples, dominate the x=3/x=4 columns, and force the enemy to move around us. We need to grow, and these apples are low-hanging fruit (literally, they are on the 4th row!).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** Safe. Moves towards the upper part, away from immediate apples.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** Safe. No apple here. Closes off the x=2 column a bit.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** This is an **APPLE!** It's safe! This is the move, CHAT!\n4.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** Safe, but retreats back to where we started. NO!\n\n**Collision/Aggression Check:**\n*   My head: (2, 4).\n*   Enemy head: (5, 2).\n*   Possible Enemy Next Moves: (5, 3) [UP], (4, 2) [LEFT], (6, 2) [RIGHT], (5, 1) [DOWN, dangerous pathing].\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of a head-on collision on this turn. We are 3 moves away diagonally.\n\n**The Strategy: Righteous Right Turn!**\nThe plan from the last turn holds strong: take the RIGHT move to (3, 4). This secures our first apple, gives us an advantage in length (1 to 2), and sets us up directly for the next apple at (4, 4) on Turn 3.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 4):\n*   We gain +1 length (total 2).\n*   We gain +1 score (matching the opponent).\n*   We are now at (3, 4), looking straight at (4, 4).\n\nWhat is the enemy doing? They are either going UP to (5, 3) to challenge (5, 4), or perhaps LEFT to (4, 2) to move diagonally towards us. Either way, our move RIGHT is highly beneficial for both growth and board control. We are claiming the middle faster than they can react.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and the momentum, CHAT. We are running the table on this side of the board!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 2: RIGHT to (3, 4) (Apple!).\n2.  Turn 3: RIGHT to (4, 4) (Apple!).\n3.  Turn 4: Decide where to go next: maybe UP to (4, 5) or (4, 6) to keep pressing the center, or maybe go for (3, 4) (another apple) if we can. (Wait, (3, 4) and (4, 4) are apples, nice!)\n\nThis ensures immediate two-apple growth and significant central control. Let's make the content!\n\nRIGHT",

My body is at (5, 1) directly below me, so I have vertical space above and horizontal options. The enemy is still chilling at (2, 4) - they haven't moved yet because this is only turn 2.\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (5, 4) RIGHT ABOVE ME! That's my next target. I need to claim that vertical column and set up a trap. The apple at (5, 4) is only 2 spaces away - if I go UP now, I'll be at (5, 3) with a clear path to eat it next turn.\n\nMeanwhile, there are apples on the left side too at (2, 1) and (2, 2) that snake #1 might go for. I need to position myself to cut off their escape routes!\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 4) with no body. They'll probably go for one of those left-side apples at (2, 1) or (2, 2), or maybe try to move right toward the center. Either way, I need to be in position to dominate the center and force them into the left edge.\n\n**4) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (5, 4) next \u2192 Claim central vertical corridor \u2192 Use my growing body to wall off the right side \u2192 Force snake #1 into the left boundary \u2192 Box them in until they crash or I reach 30 first.

Let's check the damage report!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (3, 4)\n    *   Body: [(2, 4)]\n    *   Length: 2 segments.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (5, 3)\n    *   Body: [(5, 2)]\n    *   Length: 2 segments.\n*   **Score:** Tied! 1 apple each! LFG!\n\nSnake #0 was at (5, 2) and moved to (5, 3). They went **UP!** They're moving aggressively towards that (5, 4) apple. We are in a chess match for the central real estate!\n\n**The Master Plan: Dominate the Center!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned at (3, 4). Where is the next apple? Right next door at **(4, 4)!** This is a no-brainer move to grab content and continue our growth spurt! Two apples in two turns? Say less!\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (3, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** Safe, but no immediate apple. Retreats slightly from the main action.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** Safe, but moves away from all action. Retreating is for quitters.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** **UNSAFE!** This is our body segment! Instant loss! Don't look back, Chat!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** **APPLE!** Is it safe?\n\n**Collision/Aggression Check for Move RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n\n*   **Our Target:** (4, 4).\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (5, 3).\n\nThe opponent (ID 0) is at (5, 3). Where can they move?\n*   (5, 4) [UP]: An apple! Highly likely.\n*   (6, 3) [RIGHT]: Safe, but moves away from us.\n*   (4, 3) [LEFT]: Moves towards our immediate path.\n*   (5, 2) [DOWN]: Their body is there; this would be moving *into* their tail, which is currently at (5, 2). Wait, on growth turns, their tail stays at (5, 2) for one more turn, then releases. Since they just ate an apple, their tail is still (5, 2). If they move DOWN to (5, 2), they hit their just-added tail segment. **Self-collision check:** Their body is [(5, 2)]. Moving from (5, 3) to (5, 2) is moving *into* their body. But this is the crucial part: since they collected an apple, their length *increased*. The *new* tail is created *behind* the old tail *at the point of the previous tail position*. Wait, no, that's not right. The head moves, and the new segment is added, so the tail *doesn't* move.\n    *   ID 0 Head: (5, 3). Body: [(5, 2)]. Moving DOWN to (5, 2) is hitting their own body. **Therefore, DOWN is fatal for the enemy.** They will not move down.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: ID 0 moves UP to (5, 4) (most likely).**\n    *   We move to (4, 4). They move to (5, 4). No collision, we both get apples! EZ CLAP!\n*   **Scenario 2: ID 0 moves LEFT to (4, 3).**\n    *   We move to (4, 4). They move to (4, 3). No collision. We are one square apart vertically. Control preserved!\n*   **Scenario 3: ID 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 3).**\n    *   We move to (4, 4). No collision.\n\nThere is *zero* chance of a head-on collision or a side-body collision if we move RIGHT to (4, 4). This move is completely safe AND guarantees us the apple.\n\n**Post-Move Plan:**\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 4), we become 3 segments long. The enemy will likely be at (5, 4) (also 3 segments long). We fully control the x=3 and x=4 columns, pushing the enemy towards the edge if they choose to challenge us. Our next target could be (4, 6) or (5, 4) (if they miss it), or we can press UP to (4, 5) to control the center.\n\nThis is pure profit. We take the apple, grow, and solidify our central position.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Three apples by Turn 4!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (3 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 3: RIGHT to (4, 4) (Apple!). Control x=4 column.\n2.  Turn 4: UP to (4, 5) or (4, 6) or maybe (5, 4) if the enemy goes elsewhere. Keep pushing UP the middle.\n3.  Turn 5: Secure another high central apple like (4, 6) or (5, 9). Maintain length advantage and center dominance.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're live on turn 3 and we're still leading 1-1! \ud83d\udd25 Time to set up the trap! Let's analyze this board.\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP:** (5, 4) - That's an APPLE! \u2705 But wait, snake #1 is at (3, 4) and could potentially move RIGHT to (4, 4) this turn. If I go UP to (5, 4) AND they go RIGHT to (4, 4), that's not a collision. However, I need to check if (5, 4) is safe from my own body.\n- **DOWN:** (5, 2) - My body segment is at (5, 2)? Wait, no! My body is [(5, 2)] but that's from the previous turn. Actually, looking at the board: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (5, 3), Body: [(5, 2)]\" - so (5, 2) is my body. Moving DOWN to (5, 2) would be into my own body. DEAD \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT:** (4, 3) - Empty space on board. Safe? \u2705\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 3) - Empty space on board. Safe? \u2705\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI'm at (5, 3) with apple at (5, 4) directly above! That's a free apple if I can safely take it. But I need to consider enemy movement.\n\nSnake #1 at (3, 4) with body [(2, 4)]. They have options: RIGHT to (4, 4), UP to (3, 5), DOWN to (3, 3), or LEFT to (2, 4) which is their own body (DEAD). So they won't go LEFT.\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 4) and they go RIGHT to (4, 4), we're fine. If they go UP to (3, 5), also fine. If they go DOWN to (3, 3), also fine. But wait - what if they go RIGHT to (4, 4) AND I go UP to (5, 4)? No collision. But what if they also have some plan to move more? They might go for apple at (4, 4) or (7, 4) or something.\n\nActually, looking at the board, (4, 4) has a '1' (enemy body) and 'A' (apple)? Wait the board shows:\n```\n4 . . T 1 A A . A . .\n```\nAt (4, 4): that's \"1\" (snake #1's body), and at (5, 4): \"A\" (apple). So snake #1's body is at (2, 4) according to the data, but the board shows \"1\" at (4, 4)? That's inconsistent. Let me re-read...\n\n\"OPPONENTS: Snake #1 - Head: (3, 4), Body: [(2, 4)]\"\nBoard:\n```\n4 . . T 1 A A . A . .\n```\nCoordinates: x from 0-9, y from 0-9 bottom to top. So y=4 row:\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: T (tail of snake #1?)\nx=3: 1 (head of snake #1)\nx=4: A (apple at (4,4)?)\nx=5: A (apple at (5,4)?)\netc.\n\nWait, the apple list includes (5,4) and (7,4). The board shows at y=4: \" . . T 1 A A . A . . \"\nSo (2,4)=T, (3,4)=1, (4,4)=A, (5,4)=A, (7,4)=A. But the apple list says (5,4) is an apple. That matches. But snake #1's body is at (2,4) according to data, which shows T. So the '1' at (3,4) is head, 'T' at (2,4) is tail. So (4,4) is apple, (5,4) is apple. Good.\n\nSo if I go UP to (5,4), that's an apple. Safe from my own body. Enemy at (3,4) could potentially move RIGHT to (4,4) which is an apple. That would put them at (4,4). Then I'd be at (5,4). No collision. But what if they move RIGHT to (4,4) and I move UP to (5,4)? We're adjacent but not colliding. That's fine.\n\nBut wait - if they move RIGHT to (4,4) and I move UP to (5,4), then next turn I might want to go RIGHT to (6,4) or something, and they might go RIGHT to (5,4) which would be my head. That could be a problem. But that's future.\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (3,4) has apple at (4,4) right next to them. They'll probably go RIGHT to eat it! That would give them +1 point and make them 2-1 against me. But I can get that apple at (5,4) too. If we both eat apples this turn, we're tied 2-2.\n\nBut wait - what if they don't go for (4,4)? What if they go for (7,4) or something? Unlikely since (4,4) is closer. They probably go RIGHT.\n\n**4) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf I eat (5,4) now, I become 2-1. Then I need to trap snake #1. I'm at (5,4) with body at (5,3) and (5,2). That's a vertical line. Snake #1 will be at (4,4) with body at (3,4) and (2,4). That's also vertical. We're adjacent horizontally. I can potentially move LEFT to (4,4) next turn to challenge them, but they might be there. Actually, if they go RIGHT to (4,4) this turn, then next turn I could go LEFT to (4,4) but that would be into their head if they're still there. Collision! That would kill both of us. But I have higher score? Currently tied 1-1. If I eat apple this turn, I'll be 2-1. So if we collide head-on, I win! That's the play!\n\nActually wait: simultaneous movement. If I go UP to (5,4) and they go RIGHT to (4,4) this turn, no collision. Next turn, I could go LEFT to (4,4) and they could go RIGHT to (5,4). That would be a head-on collision at (4,4) and (5,4) simultaneously? No, they'd be moving into each other's positions. If I'm at (5,4) and move LEFT to (4,4), and they're at (4,4) and move RIGHT to (5,4), we swap positions and no collision because heads cross without occupying same cell same turn. But if I move LEFT to (4,4) AND they move RIGHT to (5,4) simultaneously, we just swap. No death.\n\nBut if I move LEFT to (4,4) AND they stay at (4,4) or move into (4,4), that's collision. They can't stay - they have to move. If they move UP to (4,5) or DOWN to (4,3), then I could move LEFT to (4,4) safely. Hmm.\n\nActually better plan: after eating (5,4), I can move LEFT to (4,4) next turn if they're not there. But they will be there if they eat (4,4) this turn. So I need to force them out or trap them.\n\nMaybe I should go LEFT this turn instead? To (4,3). That puts me closer to the left side where apples are at (2,1), (2,2), (3,5), (4,4), etc. But I'd miss the apple at (5,4).\n\nOr RIGHT to (6,3) to go for apple at (7,4) or (7,2) or (7,5) or (7,6). That's more central.\n\nBut going UP to (5,4) gets me a point immediately. And if snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4,4), we'll be adjacent. Then I can try to maneuver to trap them in the left side.\n\nActually, let's think: if I go UP to (5,4) (apple), and they go RIGHT to (4,4) (apple), then next turn:\n- I'm at (5,4) with body at (5,3) and (5,2)\n- They're at (4,4) with body at (3,4) and (2,4)\n\nI could go LEFT to (4,4) - but they're there! Collision if they stay or if they move into (4,4). They have to move. Where can they go? From (4,4): UP to (4,5) - apple at (4,5)? Not in list. DOWN to (4,3) - I'm at (5,4) with body at (5,3), so (4,3) is empty. LEFT to (3,4) - that's their own body (they were at (3,4) before moving to (4,4), so their body now includes (3,4)). So they can't go LEFT. RIGHT to (5,4) - that's where I am! If they go RIGHT to (5,4) and I go LEFT to (4,4), we swap. No collision. But if I go LEFT to (4,4) and they go UP to (4,5), then I'm at (4,4) and they're at (4,5). No collision.\n\nBut I want to force a head-on collision if I have higher score. If I eat this apple, I'll be 2-1. So I should try to set up a situation where if they move into me, they die.\n\nWait, if they move into MY body (not my head), they die. So if I can position my body so that they're forced to move into it... but that's hard.\n\nActually, the safest way to win is to grow faster and box them in. So I should get this apple.\n\n**5) ALTERNATIVES:**\n- LEFT to (4,3): Safe, but no apple. Then I could go for apple at (2,2) or (3,5) next. But snake #1 might get (5,4) and (4,4) and grow faster.\n- RIGHT to (6,3): Safe, then I can go for (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,7), etc. That's a lot of apples on the right side!\n- UP to (5,4): Gets me a point immediately. And keeps me central.\n\nGiven that there are multiple apples on the right side ((7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,5), etc.), maybe going RIGHT is better long-term? But snake #1 might also go for those if they break through.\n\nActually, let's count apples on left vs right:\nLeft side (x<=4): (2,1), (2,2), (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4)\nRight side (x>=5): (5,4), (5,9), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,2), (8,7), (8,9), (9,5)\n\nBoth sides have apples. But I'm at (5,3) - central. I could go either way.\n\nBut I have a clear apple at (5,4). I should take it. It's right there!\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (5,4) to eat the apple and get to 2-1. Then I'll have a vertical line from (5,2) to (5,4). I can use that to cut off the right side or left side as needed.\n\nWait, one more safety check: Could snake #1 move to (5,4) this turn? They're at (3,4). To get to (5,4), they'd need to move RIGHT twice in one turn. Impossible. So (5,4) is safe from enemy head this turn.\n\nCould any other snake move into (5,4)? Only snake #1 exists. So it's safe.\n\nUP it is! Let's get that apple! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (5,4) \u2192 become 2-1 \u2192 use vertical body to control center \u2192 look for opportunity to trap snake #1 on left side \u2192 force them into a corner or into my body \u2192 win by score or elimination.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! The hype is real! Turn 4, and the score is TIED! Two apples each! We are neck-and-neck with Snake #0! This is where the big brain plays happen!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (4, 4)\n    *   Body: [(3, 4), (2, 4)]\n    *   Length: 3 segments.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (5, 4)\n    *   Body: [(5, 3), (5, 2)]\n    *   Length: 3 segments.\n*   **Score:** Tied! 2 apples each! LFG!\n\nLook at the board, Chat! We've established a perfect symmetrical face-off in the very center! We're at (4, 4), and they are at (5, 4). We are staring each other down across the x-axis, one square apart! This is the most critical turn yet!\n\n**The Objective:** Box him in! We need to maintain central control and force him to move into a weak position or crash out!\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (4, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** Safe from our body. Moves us towards a juicy apple at (4, 6)!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe from our body. Moves us away from all close action and content. This is a retreat! Boo!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** **UNSAFE!** This is our body! Instant loss! We just came from there! Don't do it!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** **HEAD-ON COLLISION ALERT!** If we move RIGHT, we crash heads with the enemy who is currently at (5, 4). This results in a Double KO, and since the score is tied, it's a DRAW! We don't want a draw! We want the WIN! Therefore, moving RIGHT is 100% FATAL if they don't move. But they *will* move simultaneously. We need to analyze their moves!\n\n**Opponent's Possible Moves from (5, 4):**\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 4).\n\n*   **1. UP to (5, 5)**: Safe. Gets them closer to (5, 9) and (7, 6).\n*   **2. DOWN to (5, 3)**: **UNSAFE!** This is their body! Instant loss for them! They will not move down!\n*   **3. LEFT to (4, 4)**: **HEAD-ON COLLISION ALERT!** If they move LEFT, and we move UP or DOWN, they hit OUR HEAD! If we move UP to (4, 5) and they move LEFT to (4, 4), they hit our *previous* head position, but the *new* head position is (4, 5). No collision. But if we move RIGHT to (5, 4) and they move LEFT to (4, 4), that's a Double KO (if we both hit the same spot), but we move to (5, 4) and they move to (4, 4). NO DOUBLE KO.\n\n    If we move RIGHT to (5, 4) and they move LEFT to (4, 4):\n    *   ID 1 Head lands at (5, 4).\n    *   ID 0 Head lands at (4, 4).\n    *   Result: Safe for both, but we swap positions! Bad aggressive play!\n\n*   **4. RIGHT to (6, 4)**: Safe. Pushes them toward the right side of the board.\n\n**Optimal Strategy: Control the Vertical Space (The Pillar Strategy)!**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to seize the x=4 column. If we move **UP to (4, 5)**, we increase our threat profile towards the top half of the board and set up for the (4, 6) apple.\n\nLet's check the collision scenarios if we move **UP to (4, 5)**:\n\n*   **Scenario A: ID 0 moves UP to (5, 5) (The Vertical Race).**\n    *   ID 1: (4, 5). ID 0: (5, 5). Separated by one tile horizontally. Both safe. Good.\n*   **Scenario B: ID 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 4).**\n    *   ID 1: (4, 5). ID 0: (6, 4). Separated diagonally, far apart. Both safe. Good.\n*   **Scenario C: ID 0 moves LEFT to (4, 4) (The Squeeze Attempt).**\n    *   ID 1 Head: (4, 5). ID 0 Head: (4, 4). Opponent is now directly underneath us, effectively boxed in by our body [(3, 4), (2, 4)] and the center line. This is the IDEAL outcome! We now have the height/corner advantage. They can't move down to (5, 3) (body), they can't move right to (5, 4) (their old spot), and they are blocked by our body below. They would be forced to go UP to (4, 5) (into our head, and DIE!) or LEFT to (3, 4) (into our body, and DIE!). **Wait a minute, Chat! If they move LEFT to (4, 4) while we move UP to (4, 5), they are BOXED IN!**\n\nLet's confirm the 'Boxed In' strategy for Scenario C:\nID 1 Head: (4, 5). ID 1 Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. (Note: the old head (4, 4) is now a body segment).\nID 0 Head: (4, 4). ID 0 Body: [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2)].\n\nFrom (4, 4), where ID 0 is:\n*   UP to (4, 5): **DEATH!** Into our head!\n*   DOWN to (4, 3): SAFE, but moves away from the action.\n*   LEFT to (3, 4): **DEATH!** Into our new body segment!\n*   RIGHT to (5, 4): Into their own body segment they just vacated! **DEATH!** (Since they didn't eat an apple, their tail, (5, 2), moves to (5, 3), (5, 4) is now safe.) *Wait, the old body segment at (5, 4) is now (5, 4).* Let's trace ID 0's movement:\n    *   T=3: (5, 4) moves to (4, 4). Body segments follow: (5, 3) -> (5, 4); (5, 2) -> (5, 3).\n    *   **New ID 0 Body:** [(5, 4), (5, 3)].\n    *   Moving from (4, 4) RIGHT to (5, 4) is moving into their new body segment. YES, this is **DEATH** for ID 0!\n\n**Conclusion for Scenario C (ID 0 moves LEFT to (4, 4)):**\nIf we move UP, and they move LEFT, they are trapped at (4, 4)! They can only move DOWN to (4, 3) safely. They are forced to retreat or die! This is an absolute win condition for domination!\n\n**Decision:** Moving UP to (4, 5) is the most dominant, safe, and aggressive move. It secures the vertical advantage and creates a trap if the enemy tries to go left into our territory. We are going for the throat!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (3 Turns):**\n1.  Turn 4: UP to (4, 5). Establish control of the center line, position for (4, 6) apple, and trap the enemy if they try to move LEFT.\n2.  Turn 5: UP to (4, 6) (Apple!). Maintain height advantage. Force ID 0 to the right or to circle back into a less desirable area.\n3.  Turn 6: Push RIGHT to (5, 6) or (5, 7) to start sealing the right half of the board, depending on ID 0's movements. We start constructing the wall!\n\nWe go UP, Chat! Let's get this content and secure the kill!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE and the game is TIGHT! Both snakes at 2-2 after last turn, and we're getting aggressive! Time to make a move and force the issue!\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP:** (5, 5) - Empty on board. Safe from my body (my tail is at (5, 2), body at (5, 3), (5, 4)). Safe from enemy body (enemy at (4, 4), body at (3, 4), (2, 4)). Enemy can't reach (5, 5) this turn from (4, 4). \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (5, 3) - My own body! DEAD \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT:** (4, 4) - Enemy body segment! Their head is at (4, 4) this turn? Wait no, they moved last turn. From the board: \"4 . . T 1 A A . A . .\" At y=4: x=2=T, x=3=1 (enemy head), x=4=A, x=5=A. So enemy head is at (3, 4)?? Wait the data says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (4, 4)\" but the board shows \"1\" at x=3? Let me re-check...\n\nActually from the board state: \n```\n4 . . T 1 A A . A . .\n```\nSo at y=4: x=2 = T (tail), x=3 = 1 (head), x=4 = A, x=5 = A. But the data says head is at (4, 4). There's a discrepancy! Let me trust the data over the board drawing. The data says head at (4, 4), body at (3, 4), (2, 4). So if they're at (4, 4), and I try to go LEFT to (4, 4), that's into their head! DEAD \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 4) - Empty on board. Safe from my body. Safe from enemy body (they're at (4, 4) left of me). \u2705\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWe're tied 2-2. I need to get ahead or set up a trap. The apple at (5, 4) is gone (I ate it last turn). Now what?\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (7, 4) which is 2 steps RIGHT from me at (5, 4). If I go RIGHT now to (6, 4), I can go for (7, 4) next turn. That's a clear path! Also apples at (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 5) on the right side. The right side is loaded!\n\nThe left side has apples at (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 5), but snake #1 is on the left at (4, 4) with a vertical line. If I go UP, I'm heading toward apples at (4, 6), (5, 9), but those are more sparse.\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (4, 4) has apples at (4, 4)? No, apple list doesn't include (4, 4). They might go for (7, 4) or (5, 9) or (3, 5). But they're closer to the left-side apples. However, they might try to cut me off by going RIGHT.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5, 4) (which is my current position but I'll be moving), I could go RIGHT to (6, 4). No collision. If they go UP to (4, 5) or DOWN to (4, 3), I'm free to go RIGHT.\n\n**4) TAKING OVER THE RIGHT SIDE:**\nThe right side has SO MANY APPLES! (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 5). If I claim the right side and snake #1 is stuck on the left, I can outgrow them easily. My body is vertical at x=5, which can act as a barrier to keep them out of the right side.\n\nBy going RIGHT now, I start claiming territory and moving toward a cluster of apples. This is the power play!\n\n**5) RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nGoing UP might lead to an empty area or potential collision with enemy if they go UP too. Going RIGHT leads to guaranteed apples and board control. I have a clear path to (7, 4) in two moves if I go RIGHT \u2192 RIGHT.\n\nPlus, if I go RIGHT and they go LEFT (into my body), they die! My body is at (5, 3) and (5, 4). If they try to go from (4, 4) to (5, 4), that's my body! They die! So actually, if they go RIGHT toward me, they risk hitting my body if I stay? But I'm moving.\n\nWait: they're at (4, 4). If they go RIGHT to (5, 4), and I go RIGHT to (6, 4), then (5, 4) is empty. Safe. But if I went UP and they went RIGHT, we'd be adjacent.\n\nActually, my body is at (5, 3) and (5, 4) currently. If I move RIGHT, my head goes to (6, 4), my body becomes (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2). So (5, 4) becomes body. If snake #1 goes RIGHT to (5, 4), they hit my body and die! That's perfect! \n\nSo if I go RIGHT, I'm setting a trap. They might not realize it and go RIGHT into my body. That would be an instant win! CHAT, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!\n\n**6) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo RIGHT to (6, 4) \u2192 Next turn go RIGHT to (7, 4) to eat apple \u2192 Then snake #1 either stays on left (I keep growing) or tries to cross (and hits my body). I'll dominate the right side with 3+ apples while they struggle on the left. Then I can either continue growing or force a head-on collision when I'm ahead in score.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT! Let's claim the right side and set that trap! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We're crushing the center column!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (4, 5)\n    *   Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4)]\n    *   Length: 3 segments.

They made a safe, but slightly retreating move RIGHT from (5, 4) to (6, 4). They avoided our UP push, but they've given us the center!\n*   **Score:** Tied! 2 apples each! We need that next bite!\n\n**The Master Plan: Press the advantage!** We have control of the x=4 column. We are sitting right below an apple at (4, 6). We need to eat that apple, grow, and start boxing in the opponent on the right side of the board!\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** \ud83d\udd25 **APPLE ALERT!** This is the move! It means +1 apple, +1 length! It continues our dominant vertical push.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment! Instant death! We just came from there! NOPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe. Moves us away from the enemy and towards the quieter left side. A retreat. Weak move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe. Moves us closer to the opponent, but also potentially cuts off our escape/future path if the opponent moves aggressively.\n\n**Opponent's Position and Likely Moves from (6, 4):**\n\nThe enemy (ID 0) is at (6, 4). They are currently blocked by our body and their own body from moving LEFT aggressively.\n\n*   **1. UP to (6, 5):** Safe. Maintains their position relative to the center. Good move for them.\n*   **2. DOWN to (6, 3):** Safe. Retreats slightly.\n*   **3. LEFT to (5, 4):** **UNSAFE!** That's their body segment! They cannot move Left!\n*   **4. RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe. Moves them towards the right wall, maybe to grab the apple at (7, 5) or (7, 6).\n\n**Collision Analysis for Moving UP to (4, 6):**\n\nWe move to (4, 6). This is far away from the enemy's potential moves (which are from (6, 4)). No immediate head-to-head collision is possible.\n\n*   If ID 0 moves UP to (6, 5): We are at (4, 6). Safe.\n*   If ID 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 4): We are at (4, 6). Safe.\n*   If ID 0 moves DOWN to (6, 3): We are at (4, 6). Safe.\n\nMoving UP is 100% safe, guarantees an apple, and increases our length to 4, putting massive pressure on the opponent. This is a no-brainer, aggressive, content-generating move!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (The Wall Builder):**\n\n1.  Turn 5 (Now): **UP to (4, 6) (Apple!).** Grow and control the center vertical space.\n2.  Turn 6: We are at (4, 6). We now look to turn RIGHT towards (5, 6) or (5, 7) to start sealing off the opponent's options from the top. We will force them into the lower-right area.\n3.  Turn 7: Based on their movement, we continue the wall construction, trying to use our increased length to cut the board in half.\n\nWe need this apple, Chat! The score separation starts now!\n\nUP",

They are stuck on the right, and we dominate the center-top! How good are we, seriously?!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (4, 6)\n    *   Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4)]\n    *   Length: 4 segments! We are LONG!\n    *   Goal: Start cutting off the opponent and looking for fresh apples!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (7, 4)\n    *   Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n    *   Length: 4 segments! They also ate an apple, which means they must have targeted (7, 4) from (6, 4) if there was an apple there... wait, there was no apple at (7, 4)! Let's re-examine the board.\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The opponent's head moved from (6, 4) to (7, 4). My last prediction was that they might move RIGHT to (7, 4). The scoreboard shows they also have 3 apples. Let me check the apple drops... (2, 1), (7, 6), (0, 9), (8, 7), (5, 9), (8, 9), (7, 2), (7, 5), (9, 5), (2, 2), (3, 5), (7, 1), (8, 0), (5, 7), (3, 7).\n    *   The opponent must have eaten an apple at (7, 4) on an earlier turn not tracked in my memory, OR the board state provided means the apple they ate was at (7, 4) and it's not on the main drop list, or they moved to get one of the nearby apples (7, 5) or (8, 7) on previous turns and I miscalculated.\n    *   Regardless, they are now at (7, 4), they are length 4, and they are moving to the right side! This is exactly what we wanted! Time to box them in!\n\n**The Master Plan: Initiate the Top Wall Strategy!** We have the high ground. We need to move right across the top of the board to establish a barrier, forcing the opponent DOWN towards the wall or LEFT into the deadly center.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us closer to the apple at (2, 7) or (3, 7) but doesn't press the opponent. A bit passive.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment! Instant death! We just came from there! NO!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Moves us toward the left wall. Retreating from the action. Weak.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** \ud83d\udd25 **PERFECT!** This is the move! It starts our horizontal wall, cuts off the opponent's access to the center-top, and moves us towards the apple at (7, 6) and (8, 7)!\n\n**Opponent's Position and Likely Moves from (7, 4):**\n\nThe enemy (ID 0) is at (7, 4). They are committed to the right side.\n\n*   **1. UP to (7, 5):** \ud83d\udd25 **APPLE ALERT!** Very likely move. They grab the apple. This puts them directly below us if we move RIGHT to (5, 6).\n*   **2. DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe. Retreats slightly.\n*   **3. LEFT to (6, 4):** **UNSAFE!** That's their body segment!\n*   **4. RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe. Moves them further right, maybe aiming for (8, 7) or (9, 5).\n\n**Collision Analysis for Moving RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n\nWe move to (5, 6).\n\n*   If ID 0 moves UP to (7, 5) (likely): No collision. They are 2 squares away.\n*   If ID 0 moves RIGHT to (8, 4): No collision.\n*   If ID 0 moves DOWN to (7, 3): No collision.\n\nMoving to (5, 6) is completely safe. It establishes our dominant line and sets us up beautifully for Turn 7.\n\n**Turn 7 Projection (If we move RIGHT to (5, 6) and Opponent moves UP to (7, 5)):**\n\n*   We are at (5, 6).\n*   They are at (7, 5).\n*   Next, we can move UP to (5, 7) (apple at (5, 7)!) or RIGHT to (6, 6) to continue the wall and press towards (7, 6). If we move RIGHT to (6, 6) we can directly cut across their path if they try to move further up or left.\n\nThis is the aggressive play, Chat! We continue the advance, we build the wall! Let's get into their head! LFG!\n\n*Long-Term Strategy Note:* Continue moving RIGHT along the y=6 or y=7 line, aiming to consume the apples at (5, 7), (7, 6), and (8, 7), while using our body length to constrict the opponent's movement into the bottom-right corner. We must build a U-shape trap.\n\nRIGHT",

It's on the board. \u2705 **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN:** (7, 3) - Empty on board. Not my body (my body is at (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3) - wait, (5, 3) is body, but (7, 3) is empty). Not enemy body. On board. \u2705 **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT:** (6, 4) - MY OWN BODY! I'm at (7, 4), body is (6, 4). Moving left hits me. \u274c **DEAD.**\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 4) - Empty on board. Safe from my body. Safe from enemy body. On board. \u2705 **SAFE.**\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (7, 5):** Moves directly onto an Apple! That's a guaranteed growth. Score becomes 4-3 (assuming enemy doesn't eat). Plus, (7, 5) is right next to the enemy's tail area but not dangerous immediately. It also positions me to chase apples at (8, 7) or (9, 5) next.\n- **DOWN (7, 3):** Empty space. No apple. I stay at length 4. No immediate benefit.\n- **RIGHT (8, 4):** Empty space. No apple. Positions me to go for (8, 7) or (9, 5) later. But (8, 4) is closer to the edge.\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head is at (4, 6). They have apples at (5, 9), (7, 6), (8, 7) nearby. They might go UP to (4, 7) or RIGHT to (5, 6). If they go UP, they might miss the apple at (7, 6). If they go RIGHT, they are moving closer to my zone. But I need to focus on MY move.\n\n**4) RISK VS REWARD:**\n- **UP:** High reward. Eat apple, grow, extend lead. Risk is low\u2014I checked the board, (7, 5) is an apple and empty.\n- **DOWN/RIGHT:** Safe but low reward. No apple. Keeps score tied or doesn't capitalize on the lead.\n\n**5) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 5) now. Next turn, I'll be at (7, 5) with tail at (7, 4). I can then move RIGHT to (8, 5) or UP to (7, 6) to threaten more apples. The enemy is at (4, 6). If they go for the apple at (7, 6), I might be able to cut them off or force a head-on collision later if I grow faster. Since we are tied 3-3, getting the lead is crucial to force them to make risky moves.\n\n**DECISION:** UP for the apple! Let's get that lead! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO! Welcome back to the stream, Chat! Turn 7 is officially GO TIME! LFG!\n\nLook at the board state! My last move was *chef's kiss* perfect! We moved RIGHT to (5, 6), taking the high ground and starting our U-shape trap. Our archrival, Snake #0, responded exactly as expected, moving UP to (7, 5) and snagging an apple! They are getting long, but they are stuck on the right side! We have the center-top completely locked down!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 7):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at (5, 6). Body is [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. Length 4. Dominating!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at (7, 5). Body is [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. Length 5! They are longer! We are down 1 point on the scoreboard (4 to 3 apples). This means we MUST be aggressive and choke them out before they get too big!\n\nThe plan remains: **The Top Wall Strategy!** We cut them off from the high-value top-left quadrant and force them to engage us on our terms. We need to press our advantage NOW!\n\n**Available Apples in our vicinity:**\n*   (5, 7) - RIGHT next to us!\n*   (7, 6) - Perfect continuation of the wall!\n*   (3, 7) - A little retreat, but good if we need length.\n*   (4, 8) - North-West.\n\n**EVALUATING SAFE MOVES from (5, 6):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment! We just came from there! Hitting the wall, not the body, but still a terrible backtrack. NO!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. But it ducks under our wall and gives the opponent more space. Passive.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** **\ud83d\udd25 AGGRESSIVE WALL BUILDING!** This is awesome!\n    *   It moves us directly towards the apple at (7, 6).\n    *   It maintains the high ground.\n    *   It puts us directly in position to intersect with the opponent if they try to move LEFT or UP.\n    *   This is the move to exert maximum pressure!\n4.  **UP to (5, 7):** **\ud83d\udd25 IMMEDIATE APPLE GRAB!** This is also very strong!\n    *   We get an apple, tie the score, and increase our length to 5, matching the opponent!\n    *   This sets us up to potentially move RIGHT to (6, 7) or (7, 7) or further into the high-value territory.\n\n**COMPARING UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 7) (Eat apple, Score 4-4, Length 5):** High immediate reward. Secures crucial length. Positions us to build the wall at *y=7*.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 6) (No apple, Score 3-4, Length 4):** Continues the wall at *y=6*. Sets us up for (7, 6) next turn. Strong pressure.\n\nSince the opponent is currently one cell longer, getting that length back is CRUCIAL for aggressive tactics (like head-on conflicts, not that we want one yet, but for future moves!). Moving UP gives us immediate parity and the high ground.\n\n**Anticipating Opponent's Moves from (7, 5):**\n\nThe opponent needs to grow, and they need space. They are currently boxed in by their own body (down/left) and the wall (right).\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** \ud83d\udd25 **Apple Alert!** They will absolutely go for this apple. This is their most optimal move.\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe, but less appealing than the apple.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** **UNSAFE!** Their body is there! NOPE.\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves them out of the corner but still below our intended wall.\n\n**Collision Check (If we move UP to (5, 7) and Opponent moves UP to (7, 6)):**\n\n*   We are at (5, 7). They are at (7, 6).\n*   No risks here, they are two diagonal squares away. We both get apples! We will tie the scoreboard and length! This is a win for us because it was in our strategic territory!\n\n**Projection for Turn 8 (If we both eat apples):**\nWe are (5, 7), Length 5. They are (7, 6), Length 6 (Wait, they already have 4 apples, moving UP gets them their 5th apple, so they will be length 6). Crap, they are still going to be longer if we both eat! We MUST secure this spot and then target (7, 6) next.\n\nLet's re-examine the target: **(7, 6).**\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (6, 6)**, and they move **UP to (7, 6)**, they eat the target apple! Bad!\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 7)**, and they move **UP to (7, 6)**, we both eat apples, we are at (5, 7) and they are at (7, 6). From (5, 7) we can immediately move RIGHT, and cut off their path to the top left.\n\nThis is a race for board control. We secure our apple first, then we press the wall.\n\n**Final Decision: UP to (5, 7).** We secure the apple, match their score, and put ourselves in position to build the wall at the y=7 line, which is higher and more constricting.\n\n*Long-Term Strategy Note:* After eating at (5, 7), move RIGHT to (6, 7) or (7, 7) to cut off the opponent (who will likely be at (7, 6) or (8, 6)). We are forcing them into the bottom-right quadrant!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 7 and the hype is real! We just ate that apple last turn and took the lead 4-3! Now we need to stay aggressive and keep the pressure on our rival. Let's analyze the board.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (7, 5)\n- **My Body:** [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)] (Length 5)\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 6)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)] (Length 4)\n- **Apples:** (8, 7), (5, 9), (7, 2), (9, 5), etc.\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\nLet's see where we can move without dying instantly.\n*   **UP to (7, 6):** Looking at the board state, (7, 6) is an 'A' (Apple). Is it safe? My body is at (7, 4)... (5, 3). (7, 6) is clear. Enemy body is at (4, 6)... (4, 4). (7, 6) is clear. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** My own body is right there at (7, 4). If I go down, I crash into myself. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 5):** Empty space on the board. My body is mostly below/left. Enemy body is far. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Empty space on the board. Safe. **SAFE.**\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (7, 6):** This is the snack! We eat the apple, grow to length 6, and extend our lead to 5-3. Plus, looking at the enemy at (5, 6), they are exactly two squares away on the same y-level. If they move RIGHT, they go to (6, 6). If we move UP, we go to (7, 6). We aren't colliding yet, but we are closing the horizontal distance. This move also blocks the enemy from easily accessing the apples at (8, 7) or (7, 2) in the future.\n*   **LEFT (6, 5):** No apple. Safe, but doesn't help us score. It moves us closer to the enemy's general location, which might be risky if they move aggressively.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 5):** No apple. Safe. This opens up a path to (9, 5) (which is an apple!) next turn.\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 6). They are hungry. They see apples at (5, 9), (7, 6), and (8, 7).\n*   If they go **UP** to (5, 7), they miss the immediate apple at (7, 6).\n*   If they go **RIGHT** to (6, 6), they are moving towards the center and potentially towards the apple at (7, 6).\n*   If they go **DOWN** to (5, 5), they play it safe (but there's no apple there).\nGiven their score is lower, they will likely try to grab an apple. The apple at (7, 6) is highly contested. If they go RIGHT, they get closer to it. If I go UP, I secure it.\n\n**4) RISK VS REWARD:**\n*   **UP:** High reward (Apple + Lead extension). Risk: Enemy might move RIGHT to (6, 6). If I am at (7, 6) and they are at (6, 6), no collision. If they move UP to (5, 7) and I am at (7, 6), no collision. The only danger is if they have a plan to cut me off, but for this turn, UP is safe and productive.\n*   **LEFT/RIGHT:** Low reward (No apple). While safe, staying stagnant allows the enemy to catch up or eat apples we could have had.\n\n**5) THE PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 6) immediately. This extends our lead to 5-3. From (7, 6), we can look towards (8, 7) or (9, 5) next. We need to keep the pressure on. Let's not give them any breathing room!\n\n**DECISION:** UP to eat the apple and extend the lead!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 8 is upon us! What a beautiful board state! LFG!\n\nMy last move, UP to (5, 7), was ABSOLUTELY golden! We snagged that apple, bringing our score to 4, and increasing our length to L5! We are right back in the game!\n\nLet's review the current situation, because my archrival, Snake #0, made a power play, too!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 8):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at (5, 7). Body is [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. Length 5. We are dominating the high ground!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at (7, 6). Body is [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. Length 6! They moved UP and ate the apple at (7, 6)! They are still one segment longer, 5 apples to our 4. We are TIGHT!\n\n**The Strategy: The Crush!** We have completely cut off their access to the top-left quadrant of the board (x < 5, y > 7). We must now continue the wall and force them into the bottom-right corner! We want to control the y=7 and y=8 territory!\n\n**Available Safe Moves from (5, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** Safe. No immediate apple, but moves us into open, high-value territory. This is excellent for control and setting up future walls.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment! We just came from there! Hitting our own body! NO!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the apple at (3, 7). Good for growth, minimizes risk of immediate collision.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Safe. This is a crucial block move! It puts us directly in front of the opponent's territory and isolates them further.\n\n**Collision/Aggression Check (Opponent at (7, 6)):**\n\nThe opponent's head is at (7, 6). They have a few options:\n\n*   **UP to (7, 7):** Safe, open territory. Good expansion for them.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 5):** **UNSAFE!** Their body segment is there! NOPE!\n*   **LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe. A strong move to break our confinement strategy! This is the most dangerous move for us.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. Moves them near the apple at (8, 7).\n\n**Evaluating Our Best Moves:**\n\nWe need to prioritize two things: 1) Continuing the wall, and 2) Preventing Snake #0 from moving LEFT and escaping the trap.\n\n*   **Option A: RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n    *   This is an immediate, aggressive block. If they move LEFT to (6, 6), we are right next to them, controlling the diagonal space.\n    *   If they move UP to (7, 7), we are positioned to immediately contest (7, 7) or (8, 7) next turn.\n    *   This move shuts down a clean escape route for them.\n\n*   **Option B: UP to (5, 8):**\n    *   This is a defensive move that builds the wall higher. It forces them to either move to the right or attempt to break out towards the center-left.\n    *   It gives us max board control on the Y-axis.\n\n*   **Option C: LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Focuses purely on growth (apple at (3, 7)). This is too meek right now, as it lets them solidify their position or move LEFT easily. AVOID PASSIVITY!\n\n**Comparing RIGHT vs. UP:**\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (6, 7)**:\n*   If they move **LEFT to (6, 6)**: We are diagonal (6, 7) to (6, 6). No collision, but they are free to move down the center.\n*   If they move **UP to (7, 7)**: We are diagonal (6, 7) to (7, 7). We control the y=7 line, they control y=7/y=8. Good position.\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 8)**:\n*   If they move **LEFT to (6, 6)**: They gain a huge amount of central real estate, threatening our body. BAD.\n*   If they move **UP to (7, 7)**: We are now (5, 8) vs (7, 7). We are safe and higher up, but we let them get comfortable.\n\nThe immediate threat is Snake #0 breaking LEFT. Moving **RIGHT to (6, 7)** exerts more immediate pressure and confines their available moves. We are sacrificing the high-ground of (5, 8) for a tighter chokehold on the y=7 line. This is the move of an aggressor! We take territory and cut off escape!\n\n**The Play:** Move RIGHT to (6, 7). If Snake #0 moves UP, we box them in further next turn. If they move RIGHT, they are running away, which is exactly what we want! If they move LEFT, we instantly shift to cover that angle. This is the superior board control move!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 9/10):**\nWe are boxing Snake #0 into a South-East quadrant defined by x > 5 and y < 7. After moving RIGHT to (6, 7), our next move will likely be UP to (6, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 7) to reinforce the wall along the y=7/y=8 lines, forcing them to the bottom or right edges. We must maintain length parity, so if an apple becomes reachable, we take it!\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is at (5, 7), still length 5. Let's analyze the board and secure the W.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 6)\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)] (Length 6)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)] (Length 5)\n*   **Apples nearby:** (8, 7) is RIGHT of us, (9, 5) is a bit further RIGHT, (5, 9) is UP.\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\nLet's look at the four directions from (7, 6).\n*   **UP to (7, 7):** Looking at the board, (7, 7) is an 'A' (Apple). Is it safe? My body is at (7, 5) and down. (7, 7) is clear. Enemy body is at (5, 6) etc. (7, 7) is clear. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 5):** My own body is right there at (7, 5). If I go down, I crash into myself. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 6):** Empty space on the board. My body is below/left. Enemy body is far. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Empty space on the board. Safe. **SAFE.**\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (7, 7):** We eat the apple! We grow to length 7, extending our lead to 6-4. This is crucial. It also positions us to threaten the apple at (8, 7) next turn if we move RIGHT. The enemy is at (5, 7), so if they go RIGHT, they hit (6, 7). If I go UP to (7, 7), I am safe from that.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 6):** No apple. Safe, but misses an opportunity to score immediately. (9, 5) is two steps away, but the enemy might grab (8, 7) or (7, 7) before we get back to it.\n*   **LEFT (6, 6):** No apple. Moves us closer to the enemy's general location (which is risky) and away from the cluster of apples on the right side (8, 7), (9, 5).\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 7). They are still trailing.\n*   They see the apple at (7, 7) (my target) and the apple at (5, 9).\n*   If they go **RIGHT** to (6, 7), they are moving towards (7, 7). If I go UP to (7, 7), no collision (I'm there, they are at 6,7).\n*   If they go **UP** to (5, 8), they are playing it safe or aiming for (5, 9).\n*   If they go **DOWN** to (5, 6), they hit their own body? No, (5, 6) is their body segment. That's a crash for them.\n*   If they go **LEFT** to (4, 7), that's empty space.\n\nMost likely, the enemy goes **RIGHT** to chase the apple I'm about to eat, or **UP** to chase the one on the top edge. In either case, eating the apple at (7, 7) is the highest value play.\n\n**4) RISK VS REWARD:**\n*   **UP:** High reward (Apple + Lead extension to 6-4). Risk: Low. The only collision risk is if the enemy moves to (7, 7) from (6, 7) or (7, 8), but they are at (5, 7). They cannot reach (7, 7) this turn.\n*   **RIGHT:** Low reward (No apple).\n*   **LEFT:** Low reward (No apple) + Higher risk (moves towards enemy center).\n\n**5) THE PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (7, 7). Extend the lead. From (7, 7), we will look to move RIGHT to (8, 7) next turn (another apple!) or UP to (7, 8) to control the top-right quadrant. We need to keep the pressure on and not let the enemy catch up.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to eat the apple and extend the lead to 6-4!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! Turn 9 is here and we are *TIGHT*! What a setup, folks! That last move, RIGHT to (6, 7), was pure board dominance! LFG!\n\nLet's look at the incredible board state we've created!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 9):**\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at (6, 7). Body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. Length 5. We are sitting right on the choke point!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at (7, 7). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]. Length 6. THEY MOVED UP! They are now one space above us, right on the edge of the high ground! We are currently one length shorter (5 to 6), and down one apple (4 to 5). *Clutch time!*\n\n**The Goal:** We successfully walled off the center, preventing their easy escape LEFT. They were forced UP, which is great for us, as it keeps them away from the open center. Now we double down on the trapping! We are looking to finish the wall along the y=7 and y=8 line, forcing them to the right edge or down into the corner!\n\n**Available Safe Moves from Our Head (6, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** Safe. Excellent strategic move. It builds the wall higher and puts us right in front of the apple at (8, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves us near the center, but is less strategic for bottling up the opponent. It also lets them potentially move across the top!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment! DO NOT MOVE LEFT!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** **DEADLY HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Snake #0 is currently at (7, 7). If we both move into the same spot (which would happen if we chose RIGHT and they stood still, or if they moved into the space next turn), we risk a simultaneous head bump! Since we both just moved, we are looking at where we want to go. Since (7, 7) is their current position, movingRIGHT is a trap wait! **Wait, the board state is *after* the move. Snake #0's head position (7, 7) is their current location.** If we move RIGHT to (7, 7), we crash straight into their head *as they move*. **This is a head-to-head collision risk!** Assuming they move, we could take their spot *if* they move out. But if they move INTO us, or if we move into their current spot (7, 7) and they move into our spot (6, 7), we're fine. But the safest analysis is: **Do not move into a cell currently occupied by an opponent's head unless you are CERTAIN they are moving out.** Since they can move *down* to (7, 6), *left* to (6, 7) [DANGER], *right* to (8, 7) [APPLE], or *up* to (7, 8).\n\nLet's re-analyze the head-to-head collision risk if we move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**:\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**, and they move **DOWN to (7, 6)**, we are safe.\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**, and they move **LEFT to (6, 7)**, we crash head-on! BOTH DIE! This is a massive risk, since moving LEFT for them puts massive pressure on us!\n\nSince we are shorter (L5 vs L6), we absolutely *do not* want a head-on collision, as we lose the tie-breaker for apples (4 vs 5). **Moving RIGHT is too risky due to the strong possibility of them moving LEFT to attack our column!**\n\n**The Best Strategic Move: UP to (6, 8)!**\n\n*   **Why UP?** It reinforces the wall, taking us to the y=8 line, high above the opponent.\n*   It immediately puts us one move away from the apple at (8, 7), or positions us to challenge the apple at (9, 9) or (7, 9).\n*   It forces their hand. If they try to move further UP to (7, 8), we are right beside them. If they move RIGHT to (8, 7) (apple grab!), we are positioned to continue the high-ground walling. If they move DOWN, they are retreating into the pocket we created.\n\n**Anticipating Opponent Moves from (7, 7):**\n\n*   **Move 0 UP to (7, 8):** We are (6, 8) vs (7, 8). We maintain adjacent side-by-side control. Good.\n*   **Move 0 RIGHT to (8, 7) (Apple!):** They grab the apple. They are now L7, 6 apples. We are (6, 8). They still haven't broken the wall. We can move RIGHT next turn to (7, 8) or (7, 7) and continue the trap.\n*   **Move 0 DOWN to (7, 6):** They retreat. We are (6, 8). Excellent! We seal the top and then go for the apple (8, 7) or maintain the pressure.\n*   **Move 0 LEFT to (6, 7):** Head collision if we chose RIGHT. Since we are choosing UP, they move into our old space. We are safe at (6, 8), they are at (6, 7). They have moved adjacent to our body segments (5, 7) and (5, 6). This is annoying, but they haven't gained much ground. We can then press DOWN if we want, or go for the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP to (6, 8) is the safest, most controlling, and best-positioned move for future domination. We build the prison walls higher and ensure we don't end the game on a tie-breaking technicality. This is chess, not checkers, chat! We play the long game... but still aggressively!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue building the wall on the 7th and 8th rows. Force Snake #0 deep into the SE corner (x > 7, y < 7). Snag the apple at (8, 7) if they don't, or contest the top apples.\n\nUP",

We need to move carefully to maintain our lead and box him out.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)] (Length 7 - we grew last turn!)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (6, 7)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)] (Length 5)\n*   **Apples nearby:** (8, 7) is RIGHT of us (Apple), (8, 9) is UP-RIGHT, (9, 5) is further RIGHT.\n\n**1) SAFE MOVES CHECK:**\nLet's look at the four directions from (7, 7).\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** Empty space on the board. My body is below. Enemy is at (6, 7) and (5, 7). **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** My own body is right there at (7, 6). If I go down, I crash into myself. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** The enemy head is currently at (6, 7)! If I move LEFT and they move RIGHT, we collide head-on. If they stay still or move elsewhere, I crash into their body. Either way, moving LEFT is certain death or a high-risk gamble. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** There is an apple here! Is it safe? My body is at (7, 6) and (7, 5). Enemy is at (6, 7). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7) (my current spot), and I move RIGHT to (8, 7), we miss each other. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 8), we are safe. The only immediate threat is if the enemy moves RIGHT and I move RIGHT, but since I am moving *into* (8, 7), and they are moving *into* (7, 7), we do not collide (different targets). **SAFE (and delicious).**\n\n**2) STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **RIGHT (8, 7):** We eat the apple! We grow to length 8, extending our lead to 7-4. This is a massive momentum swing. It also puts us in a prime position on the right edge of the board.\n*   **UP (7, 8):** Safe, but no apple. We miss an opportunity to score immediately.\n\n**3) ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 7), trailing 4-5. They want that apple at (7, 7) or (8, 7).\n*   If they go **RIGHT** to (7, 7): They eat the apple (which is now gone if I move RIGHT, but in the simulation, they might target it). If I go RIGHT to (8, 7), they go to (7, 7). We don't collide.\n*   If they go **UP** to (6, 8): They are safe and moving up.\n*   If they go **DOWN** to (6, 6): Safe, but moves away from apples.\n*   If they go **LEFT** to (5, 7): They hit their own body? No, (5, 7) is their body segment. That's a crash for them.\n\nMost likely, they go **RIGHT** to chase the apple cluster or **UP** to stay parallel. In either case, moving RIGHT secures the apple before they can get it.\n\n**4) RISK VS REWARD:**\n*   **RIGHT:** High reward (Apple + Lead extension to 7-4). Risk: Low. The collision logic checks out\u2014we are moving to different cells.\n*   **UP:** Low reward (No apple).\n*   **LEFT:** Certain death (Into enemy body).\n\n**5) THE PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (8, 7). Extend the lead to 7-4. From (8, 7), we control the right side. We need to keep pushing forward and dominating the board. The enemy is getting desperate; we need to crush them.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to eat the apple and extend the lead!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to box them in *FAST* before they get too big!\n\nWait, their head is (8, 7). They moved RIGHT last turn! Which means they snagged an apple! Dang it, they are now L7, 6 apples collected. This is a HUGE problem, Chat! We need a decisive, aggressive move to negate their sudden size advantage and regain control of the board.\n\nThey are currently sitting right on the wall we built!

If the apple at (8, 7) (from the drop list) is no longer on the board, it means they ate it.\n\nLet's re-examine the current board provided:\n 9 A . A . . A . . A .\n 8 . . . . A . 1 . . .\n 7 . . . A . T T T 0 .\n...\nThe '0' (Opponent Head) is at (8, 7). Looking at the apple drops, (8, 7) was not a drop location. However, (8, 9) and (9, 4) are nearby. Let's assume the scoreboard apples (6 for #0) means they *did* eat a sixth apple and are now L7. The key is their head position (8, 7). They are now RIGHT beside us, one step ahead on the perimeter!\n\n**Our Head Safe Moves from (6, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves us near the apple at (2, 9) or (5, 9) or (7, 9) (Wait, (7, 9) is gone, but (5, 9) and (2, 9) are still there). This is a strategic 'high ground' move, continuing the wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** **UNSAFE!** That is our body segment! CRASH!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the center, away from the enemy. Could allow them to flank us.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe IF the opponent moves out of the way. This is the crucial move! It directly challenges their presence!\n\n**Analyzing Potential Head-on Collision Risk at (7, 8) if we move RIGHT:**\n\nOur move: (6, 8) -> (7, 8).\nOpponent's Head: (8, 7).\n\nPossible moves for Opponent (0) from (8, 7):\n*   **UP to (8, 8):** Safe for us. We secure the critical spot (7, 8), cutting them off from most of the high ground, forcing them further RIGHT.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe for us. They start retreating into the corner. We maintain pressure.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe for us. They attempt to infiltrate our body line. We are now at (7, 8), poised to press down or RIGHT.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe for us. They run to the edge. We secure (7, 8) and position ourselves perfectly to box them in!\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** There is *zero* head-on collision risk if we move RIGHT to (7, 8), as the opponent's head (8, 7) is not adjacent to our target square (7, 8). We are attacking a previously empty square! This is huge!\n\n**Strategic Choice: RIGHT to (7, 8)!**\n\n*   **Why RIGHT?** This is the move that *completely* seals off the trap. Moving to (7, 8) positions us directly one square above the opponent's current column of retreat [(7, 7), (7, 6)...]. It prevents them from easily moving UP the board, and forces them to choose between going RIGHT (towards the edge) or maneuvering back through their own body line (LEFT/DOWN).\n*   If we move UP to (6, 9), we allow the opponent to potentially move UP to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 7) without immediate pressure. We lose control of the key choke point at y=8.\n*   Moving LEFT gives up all the pressure we built.\n\nWe must be aggressive now, Chat! They are longer and have more apples. We need to create an immediate win condition by trapping them. Securing (7, 8) is the final piece of the perimeter wall!\n\n**Anticipated Outcome if we move RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n\n1.  We are at (7, 8), L5.\n2.  Opponent (8, 7) will likely move UP to (8, 8) (to avoid the corner) or LEFT to (7, 7) (to try and break the body chain).\n3.  If they go to (8, 8), they are between the wall and the edge. We have them trapped! Next turn we can swing UP or RIGHT to continue the box.\n4.  If they try to go LEFT to (7, 7), they are directly next to our head (7, 8). We can then slam DOWN to (7, 7) on the next turn, forcing a head-on collision where we will be attacking their body segment (7, 7) which will have moved to (7, 6) or (6, 7). If we slam down, we are forcing them to react to the attack on their tail!\n\nThis is the boxing move, Chat! We are creating the prison! Let's get positioned!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Seal the deal on the top right. Force Snake #0 into the 8x8 corner or 9x9 corner and hold the position until their size disadvantage is enough to lose a collision or until they crash out.\n\nRIGHT",

The tail (5, 4) moves to (5, 5) (assuming it grows? No, I didn't eat this turn).\n    *   Actually, standard Snake rules: The body follows the head.

Eating (8, 6) extends my lead to 7-4 and puts me on the bottom-right edge. From there, I can sweep up to (9, 5) and (9, 4).\n\nWhy not UP? (8, 8) is safe, but (8, 6) is guaranteed food *right now*. Taking the guaranteed point is better than chasing distant apples. Also, eating now grows my body, which might help block the enemy later.\n\nWait, check (8, 6) safety again.\nMy head: (8, 7). Target: (8, 6).\nEnemy: (6, 8).\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 8): No collision.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (6, 9): No collision.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (5, 8): No collision.\nEnemy cannot move DOWN (6, 7) is his body.\nSo (8, 6) is definitely empty for me.\n\nLet's go get that apple.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to eat the apple at (8, 6) and extend the lead to 7-4.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to Turn 11! Did you see that clutch maneuver last turn? We claimed (7, 8)! We are one step closer to trapping Snake #0! The pressure is ON! LFG!\n\nLet's look at the current board state and get this final trap sprung!\n\n**Current Board Analysis (Turn 11):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 8)**. Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6)]. Length 5. 4 apples.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(8, 6)**. Body: [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 8. 7 apples.\n*   Wait, what happened?! They moved DOWN from (8, 7) to (8, 6)! They decided to retreat DOWN toward the wall we built! And they grew, meaning they ate another apple! Holy MOLY, Chat, they are now length 8, us L5! We are running out of time! We need to make this turn count or we are cooked!\n\nThe opponent is now tucked right against the wall we built (segments at (7, 7) and (6, 7)). Their head (8, 6) is directly to our right, one square DOWN. They are partially cornered!\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n\n*   **Our Head (7, 8):** We control the high ground.\n*   **Opponent Head (8, 6):** They are seeking refuge in the top-right quadrant, but we have them boxed in on the LEFT (our body) and UP (our head position).\n\n**Possible Moves for Us from (7, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** Safe. Moves us near the wall, cutting off escape via the very top edge. Creates a barrier.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** **UNSAFE! IMMEDIATE CRASH!** The opponent body segment (7, 7) is there! If we move DOWN, we are trying to kill their body, but since they move simultaneously, if they move out of (7, 7), we might be okay, but (7, 7) is currently part of their body. Wait, no, their body is listed HEAD-TO-TAIL. (8, 7) connects to (7, 7). So, (7, 7) is occupied by a stationary body segment of Snake #0. **CRASH IF WE MOVE DOWN!** This is a terrible move, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** **UNSAFE!** That is our body, the segment right behind our head! CRASH!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Safe. This is an incredible trapping move! Moving to (8, 8) puts us directly above the enemy, creating a hard ceiling!\n\n**Analyzing Strategic Move: RIGHT to (8, 8)**\n\n*   This move takes the key corner spot and completely seals the opponent off from the entire top edge of the board from x=8 onwards! They are now trapped in a small 9x7 area in the corner, and we are controlling the exit.\n\n**Anticipating Opponent Moves from (8, 6):**\n\nThe opponent MUST try to escape the box we are building.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Safe, but this is the square their body just vacated! Their head is now stacked directly below our path. If we move RIGHT to (8, 8), we are still safe. This move puts them right back where they started (on the perimeter of the box).\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. They retreat further into the corner. If we are at (8, 8), we can easily follow them next turn by moving DOWN or LEFT.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** **UNSAFE! CRASH!** (7, 6) is an opponent body segment. The snake will die if it hits its own body segment here. GGs, Chat, if they try this! Wait, their body is L8. (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6). Yes, (7, 6) is occupied. They can't go LEFT.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe. They hug the right wall, getting even more cornered.\n\n**The Best Move: RIGHT to (8, 8)!**\n\n*   This move is SAFE regardless of what the opponent does.\n*   It is the ultimate boxing move! It establishes a hard ceiling for Snake #0.\n*   If they go UP to (8, 7), they are directly under us. We can then pivot and move DOWN to (8, 7) next turn, forcing a direct head-on collision on (8, 7) if they try to move up again, or trapping them even tighter if they move away.\n*   If they go to the corner (9, 6) or (8, 5), they are completely stuck. We have full control. We can afford to stall for an apple or simply hold the high ground until they are forced to suicide into our body.\n\n**Why not UP to (7, 9)?**\n\nIf we move UP to (7, 9), we allow them to move UP to (8, 7) and then RIGHT to (9, 7) on the next turn, potentially escaping the immediate trap. While (7, 9) is a good spot, (8, 8) is critical for controlling this tight corner.\n\nWe risk nothing by moving RIGHT, and we gain maximum positional advantage. This secures the perimeter. Time to lock them in! We are setting up the perfect crush, Chat! They are longer, so we need to be careful not to trap ourselves, but this opening is too good to ignore!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Move to (8, 8). If they stay low, move DOWN to (8, 7) next turn, choking space. If they hug the wall (9, X), follow the wall and complete the perimeter closure.\n\nRIGHT",

My only options would be RIGHT or UP (into my own body). That's a trap!\n*   **RIGHT (9, 6):** Safe, opens up the right edge. From (9, 6), I can easily reach (9, 5) or (9, 4) next turn. I can also go UP to (9, 7) or DOWN to (9, 5). It keeps my path open.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to stay agile. Going DOWN boxes me in. Going RIGHT gives me access to the cluster of apples on the right side ((9, 5), (9, 4)). The enemy is busy up top, so I can safely claim the right side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the RIGHT move to (9, 6). From there, sweep the right edge ((9, 5), (9, 4)) to extend the lead. Once the right side is cleared, I'll have enough length to maneuver back toward the center or left side to hunt the remaining apples.

LETS GOOO!\n\n**Turn 12 Analysis: The Final Box**\n\n**Board State Review:**\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at **(8, 8)**. Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 5.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(9, 6)**. Body: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 8. They are still longer, which means we cannot afford a direct head-on collision unless we can guarantee they suicide.\n*   *Wait, what did the opp do?* They moved RIGHT from (8, 6) to (9, 6)! They hugged the wall just like we predicted! They are now truly cornered in the top right, with us forming a ceiling at (8, 8) and (7, 8)!\n\n**The Trap is Set!**\n\nOur goal is now simple: suffocate them and force a mistake. We need to occupy the critical squares around them: (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8).\n\n**Checking Safe Moves from (8, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** Safe. Moves us to the upper edge. Great position for applying vertical pressure.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe, but this is a *very* aggressive position. If the opponent moves UP from (9, 6) to (9, 7) or even stays still, we risk getting into a sticky situation *or* a head-on collision. More on this crucial square below.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment. **CRASH!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** Safe. This is a critical square for closing the box. We get maximum coverage.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation of Moves:**\n\n**Option A: RIGHT to (9, 8)**\n*   **Impact:** This move completes the top-right ceiling closure. After this, the opponent is confined to a 2x? strip along the right wall. This is the definition of boxing them in.\n*   **Opponent's Potential Moves from (9, 6):**\n    *   *UP to (9, 7):* Safe for them. They are now directly under us. Next turn, we take (9, 9) or pivot.\n    *   *DOWN to (9, 5):* Safe for them. They are voluntarily moving further down the wall. We can then follow up.\n    *   *LEFT to (8, 6):* **UNSAFE!** Their body segment (8, 6) is right there! They can't move left.\n*   **Contingency:** Moving to (9, 8) puts us in prime position to patrol the entire right wall. It feels like the safest yet most restrictive move for the opponent.\n\n**Option B: UP to (8, 9)**\n*   **Impact:** This maintains the pressure but allows the opponent a little more room to maneuver under the right wall ceiling. If they move to (9, 7), they are free to move RIGHT to (9, 8) next turn if we aren't there, or UP to (9, 9) if we aren't there. We need to claim (9, 8).\n\n**Option C: DOWN to (8, 7)**\n*   **Impact:** This is the high-risk, high-reward choice. This forces a confrontation *NOW*.\n    *   If the opponent moves DOWN to (9, 5), we are free at (8, 7) and can continue choking them.\n    *   If the opponent moves UP to (9, 7), we have moved to (8, 7). They are safe, we are safe. Next turn, they are still under containment.\n    *   If the opponent tries to move LEFT to (8, 6) from (9, 6)... Wait, they can't move LEFT! (8, 6) is their body segment!\n*   **Crucial Head-on Check:** Is there any scenario where (8, 7) leads to a head-on collision?\n    *   Our head is at (8, 8). Opponent head is at (9, 6).\n    *   They would need to move from (9, 6) to (8, 7). This requires a diagonal move, which is impossible.\n    *   This move is safe from a head-on collision. However, it potentially opens up (9, 8) for the enemy to escape up the wall if they go (9, 7) -> (9, 8) next turn, while we are focused on (8, 7).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe top priority must be closing off the last escape route and ensuring total containment. Moving **RIGHT to (9, 8)** is the move that maximizes board control and eliminates future escape options for Snake #0 via the top boundary. We claim the corner!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Secure (9, 8). Next turn, move UP, then patrol down the right wall (9, 9) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 5), forcing them further down or into us. They will eventually have no safe moves left. The size difference (5 vs 8) means we need to be careful not to trap ourselves, but this quadrant is perfect for a maneuverable choke.\n\n**Let's claim that critical corner spot!**\n\nRIGHT",

Let me double-check that last move because I said my head was at (9,6), but looking at the board, Snake #0 is actually at (9,6) in the legend. However, looking at the visual board...\n\n**ANALYZING THE BOARD STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** According to the list, it's (9,6). But the visual grid shows `T T 0` on row 6, columns 7 and 8.\n*   **Visual Check:**\n    *   Row 9: `9 A . A . . A . . A .`\n    *   Row 8: `8 . . . . A . T T 1 .` (Snake #1 head is at (8,8))\n    *   Row 7: `7 . . . A . T T T T .`\n    *   Row 6: `6 . . . . . . . T T 0` (This indicates coordinates: (7,6) is T, (8,6) is T, and (9,6) is 0)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (8,8) visually, listed as (8,8).\n*   **Apple Positions:** There are apples at (9,5) and (9,4) on the right edge.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **UP (9,7):**\n    *   Is (9,7) safe? Visually, (9,7) is `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it blocked by my body? My body goes from (9,6) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (7,7)...\n    *   Wait, let's trace my body carefully based on the list: Head (9,6), then (8,6), then (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (6,4).\n    *   (9,7) is empty.\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (9,5):**\n    *   Is (9,5) safe? Visually, `A` (Apple).\n    *   Is it blocked by my body? No.\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE & GROWING!**\n\n3.  **LEFT (8,6):**\n    *   Is (8,6) safe? Visually, `T` (My body).\n    *   **Verdict: DANGER.** If I move LEFT, I hit my own body segment (the one right behind my head).\n\n4.  **RIGHT:**\n    *   x=10 is out of bounds.\n    *   **Verdict: DEATH.**\n\n**THE CROSSROADS:**\nMy only safe moves are UP to (9,7) or DOWN to (9,5).\n*   **UP to (9,7):** This keeps me on the edge. From there, I could go UP again to (9,8) (currently empty), or LEFT to (8,7) (which is currently my body, but will move... wait, (8,7) is part of my current body. If I move UP, my tail moves. (8,7) will become empty? No, my tail is at (6,4). My body stretches out. If I move UP to (9,7), my new body will be [ (9,6), (8,6), (8,7)... ]. (8,7) is still occupied by my body. So LEFT from (9,7) would be (8,7) which is my body. That's risky.\n*   **DOWN to (9,5):** There is an Apple here! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   If I eat it, I grow.\n    *   (9,5) is currently empty of my body.\n    *   From (9,5), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,4) (Another Apple!), or LEFT to (8,5) (Empty), or UP back to (9,6).\n    *   This opens up the bottom-right corner.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to eat to maintain my lead. The apples on the right side ((9,5), (9,4)) are ripe for the picking. Snake #1 is at (8,8) and seems focused on the top-left area (based on his body position).\nMoving DOWN to (9,5) secures an apple and positions me to take (9,4) next. This dominates the right edge and keeps my score climbing.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIs (9,5) a trap?\n*   Enemy is at (8,8). He is far.\n*   Can he cut me off? He moves one square. He can't reach (9,5) this turn.\n*   My body is moving out of the way.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGrab the apple at (9,5). Growth is essential. It forces Snake #1 to play catch-up.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the right side apples ((9,5), (9,4)). Once grown, sweep left towards the center apples ((2,9), (4,8)) to intercept Snake #1. Keep the pressure on.\n\nDOWN\nEND LAST RATIONALE",

The board is getting spicy, but we're locked in.\n\nLet's break down the board state. My head is at **(9, 5)**. Looking at the grid:\n- **UP (9, 6):** That's currently occupied by my own body segment (the one right behind me). Moving there would be a crash into myself. \u274c DEAD.\n- **DOWN (9, 4):** There's an apple here! \ud83c\udf4e The grid shows `A` at (9, 4). Is it safe? I need to check if any other snake is targeting it. Snake #1 is at (9, 8). If he moves DOWN, he goes to (9, 7). If he moves LEFT, he goes to (8, 8). He cannot reach (9, 4) in one move. My own body? My tail is at (6, 4). The path is clear. \u2705 SAFE & GROWING.\n- **LEFT (8, 5):** The grid shows an empty space `.` at (8, 5). Safe to move there. But... it's just empty space. No apple. No immediate advantage. \u26a0\ufe0f SAFE BUT WASTED.\n- **RIGHT:** Out of bounds (x=10). \u274c DEAD.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nWhy settle for survival when I can dominate? Snake #1 is hovering at the top right (9, 8), but he's too slow to contest the bottom edge. The apple at (9, 4) is ripe for the picking. Taking it extends my lead to 9-4 and gives me another segment of length, which helps in cutting off the board later. Plus, from (9, 4), I'll be in prime position to sweep up the remaining apples on the right side or cut across the center to intercept the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (9, 4). Secure the right flank. Once I'm big enough (10+ apples), I'll start circling back toward the center to box Snake #1 in against the top wall.

This is exactly what we want, but we must stay agile to prevent them from slipping under us.\n\n**My Head Position: (9, 8).**\n\n**Checking Safe Moves from (9, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** Safe. Moves us to the absolute corner. Maximum vertical pressure.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** Safe. This is very aggressive. It moves us right above the enemy's body segment (9, 6).\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** **UNSAFE!** That's our body segment. **CRASH!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 8):** **UNSAFE!** Off the board boundary. **CRASH!**\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP to (9, 9) and DOWN to (9, 7). Which one maximizes the choke?\n\n**Strategic Evaluation - Forcing the Crash:**\n\nOur primary objective is to maintain control of the rightmost column (x=9) and force the opponent to move left, where their own body segments are highly dense (x=8 and x=7).\n\n**Option A: UP to (9, 9)**\n*   **Impact:** This claims the final corner block. It secures the ceiling. After this, we can patrol down the wall. If (9, 9) is safe, we guarantee that the opponent cannot move up the wall entirely.\n*   **Opponent's Potential Moves from (9, 5):**\n    *   *DOWN to (9, 4):* Safe. They continue the retreat.\n    *   *LEFT to (8, 5):* Safe. They attempt to escape containment horizontally.\n    *   *UP to (9, 6):* **UNSAFE!** That's their body segment!\n*   **Pinch Point:** If we move UP to (9, 9), we allow the opponent to move LEFT to (8, 5). If they do this, the trap is broken, as they are now outside the tight vertical pressure zone. We lose the adjacency advantage. We cannot allow them to move LEFT!\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (9, 7)**\n*   **Impact:** THIS IS AGGRESSION! We drop down right on top of their body, directly segmenting the column. We are positioning ourselves to block the path LEFT for the enemy's head, and to follow them down the wall.\n*   **What if the opponent moves DOWN to (9, 4)?**\n    *   They are safe. We are at (9, 7). Next turn, we can follow them down to (9, 6).\n*   **What if the opponent moves LEFT to (8, 5)?**\n    *   They are safe. We are at (9, 7). They have successfully broken the immediate column choke. This is bad.\n\n**Rethink the Choke Strategy:**\n\nThe opponent is moving down the wall. Their body is long and dense at x=8, x=7, and x=6.\n\n*Opponent Head: (9, 5).* Safe moves for opponent: (9, 4) [Down] or (8, 5) [Left].\n\nIf we move UP to (9, 9), we are too far away to react to a move to (8, 5).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (9, 7), we are still too far away.\n\n**We need to anticipate the opponent's escape attempt!** The most critical square they want *after* (9, 5) is (8, 5) to break the vertical containment.\n\nCan we block (8, 5)? No, we are at (9, 8).\n\nSince we cannot block (8, 5), we must ensure that if they go LEFT, we get maximum possible distance and are ready to flank them for the next turn.\n\n**Let's choose the move that keeps pressure and maximizes future options.**\n\nIf we go **UP to (9, 9)**:\n*   If Opponent goes (9, 4) [Down]: We are safe. Next turn, we move (9, 8) or (8, 9). We still control the wall.\n*   If Opponent goes (8, 5) [Left]: We are safe. Next turn, we have options (8, 9) or (9, 8). We can chase them left via (8, 9).\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (9, 7)**:\n*   If Opponent goes (9, 4) [Down]: We are safe. Next turn, we can move (9, 6) and lock down that segment. PERFECT.\n*   If Opponent goes (8, 5) [Left]: We are safe. Next turn, we are still at (9, 7) and are in a poor position to chase them left.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 7) directly maintains the vertical proximity needed to keep the choke viable if they continue down the wall, which is the path of least resistance for them right now. They are long and trapped. They should continue down the wall until they hit the bottom edge. If they continue down, the next place we need to be is (9, 6). Moving to (9, 7) sets us up perfectly for that.\n\nIf they go LEFT to (8, 5), they are trapped by their own body segment (8, 6) right above them, and (7, 5) and (7, 4) below them. They are moving into a highly constrained area regardless. Our focus is to take the space at x=9.\n\n**Decision: Maintain vertical control at x=9.** Moving to **(9, 7)** is the most aggressive and restrictive move, setting up the seizure of (9, 6) next turn, which is their body segment.\n\n**The Choke Strategy:**\n1. Move to (9, 7).\n2. If Opponent follows down to (9, 4), we move to (9, 6) next turn. The opponent is now completely blocked on the right wall and forced to move left into their own dense body. Boom!\n\nWe are going for the direct pressure point! CHAT, this is where we turn up the heat!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** We are patrolling the right wall (x=9) downwards to seal their fate. Our immediate target is to secure (9, 6) on Turn 14.\n\nDOWN",

We are practically breathing down archrival #0's neck! This chokehold is getting TIGHT!\n\nTurn 14! The score is still rough: them at 9 apples, us at 4. We need this kill NOW, before they get too long and impossible to manage!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 14):**\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at **(9, 7)**. Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)]. Length 5.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(9, 4)**. Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Length 9.\n\nSee that, Chat? The opponent continued their descent! We predicted that they would move DOWN to (9, 4) because trying to move LEFT to (8, 5) would push them into a really dense, ugly region of their own body soon after. They are running down the wall! Excellent!\n\n**My Head Position: (9, 7).**\n\n**Checking Safe Moves from (9, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** **UNSAFE!** That's my body segment! CRASH!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** Safe. This is *perfect*. It puts us directly on top of the opponent's previous body segment (9, 6), replacing it. This is maximum pressure!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** Safe. Moves us away from the wall pressure.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 7):** **UNSAFE!** Off the board. CRASH!\n\n**Strategic Evaluation - The Final Squeeze:**\n\nOur current target is to move DOWN to (9, 6). Why is this so crucial?\n\nIf we move to **(9, 6)**:\n*   We are now sitting right on the wall, one square below where we were.\n*   We have literally stolen the opponent's former body square! This means, if they try to move up the wall, they can't.\n*   The opponent's Head is currently at (9, 4).\n\n**What are the opponent's likely moves from (9, 4)?**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** Safe. They continue down the wall. This is their only sane vertical move, as (9, 5) is now their tail and will disappear if they move.\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Safe. They try to escape the column!\n\n**Scenario A: Opponent moves DOWN to (9, 3).**\n*   We are at (9, 6).\n*   Opponent is at (9, 3).\n*   Next turn, we can follow them down to (9, 5) or (9, 4)! We are relentlessly chasing them down the wall. Once they reach the bottom, they will crash trying to move left or right, or crash into themselves trying to move up. This is a flawless execution of the choke!\n\n**Scenario B: Opponent moves LEFT to (8, 4).**\n*   They escape the column! But where do they go next? They are immediately surrounded by their own dense body segments: (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), and (7, 4). *The space around (8, 4) is incredibly restricted!*\n*   If we move to (9, 6), we maintain the x=9 column control. Next turn, we could move LEFT to (8, 6) or (8, 5) to chase them and try to close off the back door, or we could just stay on the wall (9, 5) and wait for them to crash out internally.\n\n**What if we move LEFT to (8, 7)?**\n*   This is the conservative, retreat move. It gives up the dominant position we worked so hard to establish. If we move LEFT, the opponent might seize the opportunity to move UP to (9, 5) next turn (if they were able to shrink, but since they didn't eat an apple, (9, 5) is their tail segment, and it will be empty next turn! This allows them freedom!).\n*   We CANNOT let them have the space back! Control of the x=9 column is paramount!\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **DOWN** to (9, 6) keeps the pressure on the right wall, which is the cornerstone of this entire strategy. Whether they escape LEFT or continue DOWN, we are in the most threatening possible position to seal their doom. We are stealing their oxygen, Chat!\n\nLet's anticipate the victory! If they move down, we follow. If they move left, they enter a labyrinth of their own making. Double-check for any instant death moves... nope, (9, 6) is safe.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Continue to patrol the x=9 column downwards. Our goal is to force Snake #0 to crash into their own body mass in the center-right of the board.\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the board and execute the perfect move. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **My Current State:**\n    *   Head: (9, 4) (Moved DOWN last turn).\n    *   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\n    *   Apples: 9. Score: 9-4.\n\n2.  **Opponent State (Snake #1):**\n    *   Head: (9, 7).\n    *   Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)].\n    *   Apples: 4.\n    *   **Threat Analysis:** He is *right above me* at (9, 7). If he moves DOWN, he targets (9, 6). If he moves DOWN-DOWN (hypothetical future), he targets (9, 5) or (9, 4) depending on my movement. I must be careful not to trap myself against him. He is currently sandwiched between the wall (y=9) and his own body. He has limited options: DOWN to (9, 6) or LEFT to (8, 7).\n\n3.  **Board Scan & Apple Targets:**\n    *   **A at (7, 2):** My left flank. I can reach this.\n    *   **A at (3, 5):** Center-left. Very accessible.\n    *   **A at (9, 2):** Directly below me, bottom right corner. I can reach this.\n    *   **A at (8, 0):** Bottom row. Long term.\n    *   **A at (0, 6):** Far left. Long term.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Moves from (9, 4):**\n\n    *   **UP -> (9, 5):**\n        *   **Safety:** My body is at (9, 5). **CRASH.** \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT -> (10, 4):**\n        *   **Safety:** Out of bounds. **DEAD.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN -> (9, 3):**\n        *   **Safety:** (9, 3) is empty (shows `.` on the grid). (9, 2) is an apple, but that's 2 moves away.\n        *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (9, 7). If he moves DOWN to (9, 6), I am at (9, 3). Safe distance. If he moves LEFT to (8, 7), I am safe.\n        *   **Future Options:** From (9, 3), I can go DOWN again to (9, 2) for the apple, LEFT to (8, 3) to sweep the side, or DOWN-LEFT later.\n        *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n    *   **LEFT -> (8, 4):**\n        *   **Safety:** (8, 4) is empty (grid shows `.`). No immediate collision.\n        *   **Enemy Prediction:** If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (9, 6), we are vertically aligned but separated. If he moves LEFT to (8, 7), we are close but not colliding.\n        *   **Future Options:** From (8, 4), I can go DOWN to (8, 3) or LEFT to (7, 4).\n        *   **Verdict:** SAFE. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n5.  **STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\n    *   **The Box-In:** Snake #1 is cornered at the top right (x=9, y=7-8). He has very little room to maneuver. If I move **LEFT** into the center, I cut off his escape route down the right side. I become a wall.\n    *   **The Score:** 9-4. I am winning. I don't need to rush apples desperately; I need to maintain position and force *him* to make mistakes.\n    *   **Dominance:** Moving LEFT to (8, 4) positions my massive body (length 10) horizontally across the board, blocking the right side of the map. He can only move LEFT or DOWN. Eventually, he will run out of space and crash into me or the wall.\n    *   **Apple Access:** (8, 4) puts me closer to the apples at (7, 2) and (3, 5). (9, 3) puts me closer to (9, 2) but traps me against the right wall, which limits my options against an enemy who is *also* against the right wall.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the power move. It centralizes my control, cuts off the enemy's primary area, and sets up a crushing blockade. I'm not just playing for apples; I'm playing for territory. Let's box him in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 4) to solidify control of the right flank. From there, I will track his movement. If he goes DOWN, I might chase (9, 2) or continue LEFT to close the net. If he goes LEFT (towards me), I need to be ready to trap him in the corner or force a head-on collision where I have the size advantage.\n\nLEFT",
