My intention is to move right to eat the apple at (5, 5).\n\nMoving right will place me at (9, 6). This is a valid move. I can successfully eat the apple at (5, 5), growing my snake.  Now, I need to consider the new apple locations after eating. The apples are now at (0, 9), (5, 5), (9, 3), (6, 1), (9, 0).\n\nSince I just ate the apple at (5,5), the apples at (0,9), (9,3), (6,1) and (9,0) are now closer to me than the further ones. In this case, I should move right to get closer to the apple at (9,0). However moving to the right would put me out of bounds. Let's analyze other options. \n\nThe apple at (9,0) is directly to my right and still within bounds. Also, Snake #0 is at (2, 8), and moving right won't put me in a collision with it. Thus moving right is the best option.\n\nNext move: RIGHT",
