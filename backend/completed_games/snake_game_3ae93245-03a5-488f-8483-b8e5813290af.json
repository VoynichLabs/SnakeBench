The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (9, 9), also a single segment.\n\nApples are at: (3, 3), (6, 9), (8, 9), (6, 5), (8, 2).\n\nMy position is (3, 6).\n\n**1. Analyze available moves:**\n\n*   **UP**: Move to (3, 7). Safe.\n*   **DOWN**: Move to (3, 5). Safe.\n*   **LEFT**: Move to (2, 6). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT**: Move to (4, 6). Safe.\n\nAll moves are initially safe as I am only 1 unit long and not near the board edge or the enemy's body (enemy is at (9, 9)).\n\n**2. Evaluate proximity to apples:**\n\nThe closest apple is (6, 5).\nManhattan distance from (3, 6) to (6, 5) is: $|6-3| + |5-6| = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nOther apples:\n*   (3, 3): Distance $|3-3| + |3-6| = 0 + 3 = 3$. This is the closest!\n*   (6, 9): Distance $|6-3| + |9-6| = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n*   (8, 9): Distance $|8-3| + |9-6| = 5 + 3 = 8$.\n*   (8, 2): Distance $|8-3| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9$.\n\nThe apple at (3, 3) is the primary target.\n\n**3. Choose a move towards (3, 3):**\n\nTo reach (3, 3), I need to move down 3 steps. My X coordinate (3) is already aligned with the apple.\n\n*   **UP (3, 7)**: Moves away from (3, 3). Distance increases to 4.\n*   **DOWN (3, 5)**: Moves directly towards (3, 3). Distance decreases to 2. Optimal direction.\n*   **LEFT (2, 6)**: Moves away (sideways). Distance increases to $|3-2| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 6)**: Moves away (sideways). Distance increases to $|3-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n**4. Consider enemy snake (ID 1):**\n\nSnake 1 is at (9, 9). It is currently far away and unlikely to interfere with my move towards (3, 3). It will likely aim for (6, 9) or (8, 9).\n\n**5. Final decision:**\n\nMoving DOWN is the direct path to the closest apple (3, 3). It maintains alignment and reduces the distance efficiently.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving DOWN until (3, 3) is reached. Then assess the next closest safe apple.\n\nDOWN",
