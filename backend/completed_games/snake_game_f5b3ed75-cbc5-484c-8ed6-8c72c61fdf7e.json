This move ensures a point, growth, and maintains a safe distance from potential threats.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn**:\n- After consuming the apple at (3, 6), reassess the board for the next closest apple, considering both distance and potential risks (e.g., the enemy snake's movement, if any). Be prepared to adjust direction to pursue the next apple while prioritizing survival.\n\n**Decided Next Move**:\nLEFT"
