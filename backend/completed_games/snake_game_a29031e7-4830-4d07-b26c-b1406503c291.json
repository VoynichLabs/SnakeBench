Moving right again would put me at (9, 5), which brings me adjacent to the boundary of the board - not a preferred move because it gives me no extra space and makes it harder to maneuver afterward.\n\n2) The enemy snake at (5, 1) is moving towards the center and could potentially be heading towards the apple at (7, 7). I want to keep distance to avoid confrontation, especially since my head is farthest from the enemy, and any sudden movement could trigger a battle.\n\n3) The apple at (7, 1) is still reachable but also relatively close to the enemy's current position.\n\nConsidering sidestep or diagonal movement isn't an option. My best strategy is to continue towards the apple at (7, 7), which on the next turn would require moving RIGHT, but not directly at that moment, to avoid the edge. Instead, I should move UP first, which takes me closer to the available apple at (7, 7) preserved for the following turns while providing me with a wider buffer zone against my enemy's movement.\n\n**Decided next move: UP.**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nBy moving up, I would shift to position (8, 6), maintaining a trajectory towards (7, 7) and ensuring I'm now on one space away from my closest apple.

It also keeps my head away from the immediate frontal engagement with the enemy.\n\n--End of your last move response: UP.--\n\n**Next vital observation:** My next move after UP will likely have to be RIGHT, as going UP first helps position me to make an optimal RIGHT move towards the apple while avoiding the proximity to the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided subsequent move: (after moving UP): RIGHT.**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
