The board is 10x10.\n\n**Objective:** Move towards the nearest apple while ensuring safety.\n\n**Current State:**\n*   My Head: (3, 6)\n*   Apples: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (3, 7), (6, 5)\n*   Enemy Head (Snake #0): (4, 3)\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1.  **Out of Bounds:** Moving to (3, 7) [UP], (3, 5) [DOWN], (2, 6) [LEFT], or (4, 6) [RIGHT] is safe regarding board boundaries (0-9).\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Since I have no body, self-collision is impossible this turn, even moving backward (to (3, 5)).\n3.  **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy Head is at (4, 3).\n    *   UP to (3, 7): Safe from (4, 3).\n    *   DOWN to (3, 5): Safe from (4, 3).\n    *   LEFT to (2, 6): Safe from (4, 3).\n    *   RIGHT to (4, 6): Safe from (4, 3).\n\nAll four directions are currently safe from immediate death.\n\n**Apple Evaluation (Distance squared from (3, 6)):**\n1.  (3, 7) [UP]: Distance = $(3-3)^2 + (7-6)^2 = 1$. (1 step)\n2.  (1, 8) [UP/LEFT]: Distance = $(1-3)^2 + (8-6)^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n3.  (6, 5) [DOWN/RIGHT]: Distance = $(6-3)^2 + (5-6)^2 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n4.  (0, 4) [DOWN/LEFT]: Distance = $(0-3)^2 + (4-6)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13$.\n5.  (5, 1): Distance = $(5-3)^2 + (1-6)^2 = 4 + 25 = 29$.\n\nThe closest apple is (3, 7), which is directly UP.\n\n**Enemy Strategy Consideration:**\nSnake #0 is at (4, 3). It will likely try to move towards an apple or towards me if it perceives an advantage.\n*   Closest apples to (4, 3) are: (5, 1) [Dist 2], (6, 5) [Dist $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2} = \\sqrt{8}$], (3, 7) [Dist $\\sqrt{1^2+4^2} = \\sqrt{17}$].\n*   If Snake #0 moves UP to (4, 4), it is moving towards (3, 7).\n\nMoving UP to (3, 7) eats the nearest apple and puts me one step closer to winning score 30. Since the enemy is far away from (3, 7) and moving towards it is not guaranteed (it might prioritize (5, 1) or (6, 5)), prioritizing the closest food is the standard safe opening strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to target apple (3, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on consecutive apples, especially those near the edges, while maintaining openness. Initially, target (3, 7), then potentially move towards (1, 8) or (6, 5).\n\nUP",

I moved UP from (3, 6) to (3, 7) and collected the apple at (3, 9) in the previous turn based on the board state provided at the start of Turn 2.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate the starting condition for Turn 2 based on the board provided and the last move stated.\nPrevious Head: (3, 6). Last Move: UP.\nNew Head position calculation: (3, 6) + UP = (3, 7).\n\nChecking the apples list provided for Turn 2: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9).\nThe apple at (3, 9) is an apple remaining, not the one I targeted if I moved to (3, 7).\n\nIf my last move was UP from (3, 6), my new head is (3, 7).\nIf (3, 7) had an apple, my score would be 2, and my body segment count would increase.\nThe board state shows:\n7 . . . 1 . . . . . . (My head is here: (3, 7))\nThe apples list shows: (3, 9) is an apple. (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5).\nThis implies that the apple that was previously at (3, 7) is *gone*, and I successfully ate it, yet the score listed is still 1. This is a mismatch:\nIf Head is (3, 7) and Score is 1, it means the apple I moved toward (3, 7) was NOT the apple listed *at the start of turn 1* that I was targeting.\n\nLet's reconstruct Turn 1 based on the initial state of Turn 1:\nT1 Start State: Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 5)] <- ERROR in reading T1 input: T1 Body was [(3, 6)], Head (3, 7) in the description implies T1 head was (3, 6).\nT1 description indicates:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 7), Body: [(3, 6)], Apples collected: 1.\nWait, this description is the *current* state *at the start of Turn 2*.\n\n**State at Turn 2 Start:**\nMy Head: (3, 7)\nMy Body: [(3, 6)] (Length 2, implying 1 apple collected)\nLast Move chosen in T1 was UP.\nTo get from a position $P_{T1, H}$ to $P_{T2, H}=(3, 7)$ via UP, $P_{T1, H}$ must have been $(3, 6)$.\nThis matches the rationale's assumption for the previous turn: Head at (3, 6) moving UP.\nIf UP was chosen from (3, 6), the new position is (3, 7).\nDid (3, 7) have an apple at T1 start? The T1 Apple list was: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9). *No (3, 7).*\n\nThis means:\n1. My T1 move (UP from (3, 6) to (3, 7)) did NOT eat an apple.\n2. My score remains 1. My length remains 2 (Head (3, 7), Body (3, 6)). The tail (3, 5) was implicitly dropped because I didn't eat. This matches the board depiction: 1 at (3, 7), T at (3, 6).\n\nEnemy Snake #0: Head (4, 4). Last move must have been UP from (4, 3) or RIGHT from (3, 4) or LEFT from (5, 4) or DOWN from (4, 5) hoping to eat something or move safely. The rationale in T1 assumed Enemy Head was (4, 3), but the board for T2 shows Enemy Head at (4, 4). This implies Snake #0 moved UP from (4, 3) or DOWN from (4, 5) or side to side... Given the T1 rationale mentioned Enemy head at (4, 3), it is highly likely Snake #0 moved UP to (4, 4) this turn.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis (Turn 2):**\nMy Head: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6)]. Safe moves: (3, 8) [UP], (3, 6) [DOWN - Self collision avoidance: (3, 6) is my body segment, so moving DOWN kills me], (2, 7) [LEFT], (4, 7) [RIGHT].\n\nSafety Check:\n1. **DOWN to (3, 6):** Collision with Body segment (3, 6). **DEAD.** Must not choose DOWN.\n2. **UP to (3, 8):** Safe from self.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe from self.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe from self.\n\nEnemy Head: (4, 4).\n\nCollision Check with Enemy at (4, 4):\n*   UP to (3, 8): Safe. (4, 4) moving to (3, 8) is not possible for the enemy in one step, nor is our destination (3, 8) equal to (4, 4).\n*   LEFT to (2, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 7): Safe. (4, 7) != (4, 4).\n\n**Apple Evaluation (Distance squared from (3, 7)):**\nApples: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9).\n\n1. (3, 9) [UP]: Distance = $(3-3)^2 + (9-7)^2 = 4$. (2 steps)\n2. (1, 8) [UP/LEFT diagonal]: Distance = $(1-3)^2 + (8-7)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n3. (6, 5) [DOWN/RIGHT diagonal]: Distance = $(6-3)^2 + (5-7)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13$.\n4. (0, 4) [DOWN/LEFT diagonal]: Distance = $(0-3)^2 + (4-7)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18$.\n5. (5, 1): Distance = $(5-3)^2 + (1-7)^2 = 4 + 36 = 40$.\n\nThe best immediate target is (3, 9) (UP).\n\n**Enemy Path Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 4)):**\nClosest apples to (4, 4):\n*   (3, 9): Distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.1$\n*   (1, 8): Distance $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n*   (6, 5): Distance $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$ (Closest to enemy)\n\nSnake #0 is highly likely to move toward (6, 5). Possible moves for #0: RIGHT to (5, 4), or DOWN to (4, 3), or RIGHT/DOWN diagonal move to (5, 3) or (5, 5)...\nIf #0 moves towards (6, 5):\n*   If #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 4): Safe for me to move UP to (3, 8).\n*   If #0 moves DOWN to (4, 3): Safe for me to move UP to (3, 8).\n\nSince (3, 9) is the closest apple to me: **UP** is the preferred move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue pushing towards the nearest accessible apple, currently (3, 9). Maintain a route that maximizes open space for maneuverability if necessary, though at this early stage, goal pursuit is primary. Since moving DOWN is suicide, I am free to explore the top half of the board for now.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This is a mismatch:\nIf Head is (3, 7) and Score is 1, it means the apple I moved toward (3, 7) was NOT the apple listed *at the start of turn 1* that I was targeting.\n\nLet's reconstruct Turn 1 based on the initial state of Turn 1:\nT1 Start State: Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 5)] <- ERROR in reading T1 input: T1 Body was [(3, 6)], Head (3, 7) in the description implies T1 head was (3, 6).\nT1 description indicates:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 7), Body: [(3, 6)], Apples collected: 1.\nWait, this description is the *current* state *at the start of Turn 2*.\n\n**State at Turn 2 Start:**\nMy Head: (3, 7)\nMy Body: [(3, 6)] (Length 2, implying 1 apple collected)\nLast Move chosen in T1 was UP.\nTo get from a position $P_{T1, H}$ to $P_{T2, H}=(3, 7)$ via UP, $P_{T1, H}$ must have been $(3, 6)$.\nThis matches the rationale's assumption for the previous turn: Head at (3, 6) moving UP.\nIf UP was chosen from (3, 6), the new position is (3, 7).\nDid (3, 7) have an apple at T1 start? The T1 Apple list was: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9). *No (3, 7).*\n\nThis means:\n1. My T1 move (UP from (3, 6) to (3, 7)) did NOT eat an apple.\n2. My score remains 1. My length remains 2 (Head (3, 7), Body (3, 6)). The tail (3, 5) was implicitly dropped because I didn't eat. This matches the board depiction: 1 at (3, 7), T at (3, 6).\n\nEnemy Snake #0: Head (4, 4). Last move must have been UP from (4, 3) or RIGHT from (3, 4) or LEFT from (5, 4) or DOWN from (4, 5) hoping to eat something or move safely. The rationale in T1 assumed Enemy Head was (4, 3), but the board for T2 shows Enemy Head at (4, 4). This implies Snake #0 moved UP from (4, 3) or DOWN from (4, 5) or side to side... Given the T1 rationale mentioned Enemy head at (4, 3), it is highly likely Snake #0 moved UP to (4, 4) this turn.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis (Turn 2):**\nMy Head: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6)]. Safe moves: (3, 8) [UP], (3, 6) [DOWN - Self collision avoidance: (3, 6) is my body segment, so moving DOWN kills me], (2, 7) [LEFT], (4, 7) [RIGHT).\n\nSafety Check:\n1. **DOWN to (3, 6):** Collision with Body segment (3, 6). **DEAD.** Must not choose DOWN.\n2. **UP to (3, 8):** Safe from self.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe from self.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe from self.\n\nEnemy Head: (4, 4).\n\nCollision Check with Enemy at (4, 4):\n*   UP to (3, 8): Safe. (4, 4) moving to (3, 8) is not possible for the enemy in one step, nor is our destination (3, 8) equal to (4, 4).\n*   LEFT to (2, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 7): Safe. (4, 7) != (4, 4).\n\n**Apple Evaluation (Distance squared from (3, 7)):**\nApples: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9).\n\n1. (3, 9) [UP]: Distance = $(3-3)^2 + (9-7)^2 = 4$. (2 steps)\n2. (1, 8) [UP/LEFT diagonal]: Distance = $(1-3)^2 + (8-7)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n3. (6, 5) [DOWN/RIGHT diagonal]: Distance = $(6-3)^2 + (5-7)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13$.\n4. (0, 4) [DOWN/LEFT diagonal]: Distance = $(0-3)^2 + (4-7)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18$.\n5. (5, 1): Distance = $(5-3)^2 + (1-7)^2 = 4 + 36 = 40$.\n\nThe best immediate target is (3, 9) (UP).\n\n**Enemy Path Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 4)):**\nClosest apples to (4, 4):\n*   (3, 9): Distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.1$\n*   (1, 8): Distance $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n*   (6, 5): Distance $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$ (Closest to enemy)\n\nSnake #0 is highly likely to move toward (6, 5). Possible moves for #0: RIGHT to (5, 4), or DOWN to (4, 3), or RIGHT/DOWN diagonal move to (5, 3) or (5, 5)...\nIf #0 moves towards (6, 5):\n*   If #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 4): Safe for me to move UP to (3, 8).\n*   If #0 moves DOWN to (4, 3): Safe for me to move UP to (3, 8).\n\nSince (3, 9) is the closest apple to me: **UP** is the preferred move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue pushing towards the nearest accessible apple, currently (3, 9). Maintain a route that maximizes open space for maneuverability if necessary, though at this early stage, goal pursuit is primary. Since moving DOWN is suicide, I am free to explore the top half of the board for now.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent Head: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6)]. Target Apple: (3, 9).\n\nPossible Moves: (3, 8) [UP], (2, 7) [LEFT], (4, 7) [RIGHT]. (DOWN to (3, 6) is suicide).\n\n1. **Move UP to (3, 8):**\n   - This advances directly towards the closest apple (3, 9).\n   - New Head position (3, 8). Body becomes [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. Length increases to 3 if we eat. If we don't eat, Body becomes [(3, 7)]. (Current state: Length 2).\n   - If we move UP, the enemy at (4, 4) is unlikely to collide directly with us, as (3, 8) is far from (4, 4). We must predict the enemy's move.\n\n2. **Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 4)):** Closest apple remains (6, 5) (distance $\\sqrt{5}$).\n   - Likely moves for #0: RIGHT to (5, 4), or DOWN to (4, 3), or maybe diagonally towards (5, 5) or (5, 3).\n   - If #0 moves to (5, 4) (RIGHT), or (4, 3) (DOWN), no collision with (3, 8).\n   - If #0 moves to (5, 5) (Up-Right), no collision with (3, 8).\n\n3. **Move LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves perpendicular to the target (3, 9). Dist increases to $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} + (\\text{distance to } 3, 9) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}$. Worse path.\n\n4. **Move RIGHT to (4, 7):** Moves parallel to the column of the target (3, 9), but away from it horizontally. Dist increases to $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} + (\\text{distance to } 3, 9) = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5}$. Worse path.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving UP directly targets the easily reachable nearest apple (3, 9), which is only 1 move away from the head (3, 8). This maximizes immediate progress without undue risk, as the next step (3, 9) is not blocked by the enemy in sight.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Prioritize consumption of the closest apple (3, 9). If successful, re-evaluate the remaining apples, prioritizing either (1, 8) or moving to intercept the enemy if they seem to be heading towards a less favorable area. Avoid moving down at all costs.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

My body is now [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. I have not collected the apple at (3, 9) yet; it is still present according to the list.\nIf (3, 9) was available, and I moved to (3, 8), I did not eat. Score remains 2, length remains 3 (Head + 2 body segments) since I did not eat. The previous state showed Length 2: Head (3, 7), Body (3, 6). Moving UP to (3, 8) drops the tail segment (3, 6) if no apple is eaten. My new body should be [(3, 7)].\n\nLet's re-verify body growth rule against the provided state:\nT3 Start: Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 6)]. Length 2. Score 2.\nT3 Move: UP to (3, 8). Target Apple (3, 9). Did not eat (3, 9).\nT4 Start Board State: Head (3, 8). Body [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. Score 2.\nIf score is 2, length is 3 (Head + 2 segments). If I did not eat, the tail segment from T3 start should have been dropped.\nT3 Start Body: [(3, 6)]. Tail is (3, 6).\nT3 Move UP $\\rightarrow$ New Head (3, 8). Previous Head (3, 7) becomes segment 2. Previous Segment 2 (3, 6) becomes segment 3 (Tail).\nIf I *did not* eat, the tail segment (3, 6) should have been dropped. My new body should be [(3, 7)]. Length 2.\n\nHowever, the board state for T4 explicitly shows: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. Length 3. This implies that I *must* have eaten an apple on Turn 3, resulting in a score of 3, OR the game rules implicitly mean that the tail is only dropped *if* the move doesn't result in growth, AND that the provided score/body state *must* be correct.\n\nIf Score is 2, and Body is length 3: This suggests the snake collected 2 apples, but somehow started T3 with length 2, moved without eating, and ended T3 with length 3. This is mathematically inconsistent with standard snake game growth/shrinkage upon not eating.\n\n**Assumption based on provided T4 state:** My score increased to 2 (if it was 1 previously, which it was in the rationale context), and my length increased to 3 [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. This means I must have eaten *an apple* at (3, 8) on T3.\nLet's check T3 Apple list: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9).\nIf I moved UP from (3, 7) to (3, 8), and ate something, it must have been at (3, 8). But (3, 8) was NOT an apple in the T3 list. (3, 9) was.\n\n**Reconciling State Mismatch:**\nThe T3 Rationale stated the goal was (3, 9) and the move was UP.\nThe T4 State shows: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 7), (3, 6)], Score 2. (vs T3 Score 1).\n\nPossibility A: The provided T3 Apple list was WRONG, and (3, 8) actually held an apple, which I ate by moving UP from (3, 7). Score 1 $\\rightarrow$ 2. Body grows. Tail (3, 6) retained because I grew. New Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)] if tail wasn't dropped.\nIf I ate, Body should be [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)] (Length 4 if T3 start was L3).\nT3 Start: Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 6)]. Length 2. Score 1.\nIf I eat at (3, 8): New Head (3, 8). New Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Length 4. Score 2.\nT4 state shows Body length 3: [(3, 7), (3, 6)].\n\nPossibility B: I did NOT eat. Score remained 1. I moved UP to (3, 8). Tail (3, 6) dropped. New Body [(3, 7)]. Length 2.\nT4 state shows: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. Score 2. This contradicts Possibility B entirely regarding both score and length change.\n\n**Given the constraints of the prompt, I must assume the T4 state is the ground truth:** Score 2 (implying I ate exactly once more since T1/T2 transition, making the total 2 eaten), and Body Length 3: [(3, 8) Head, (3, 7), (3, 6)]. This MUST mean I ate an apple on T3, and that apple removal led to the current body structure.\n\nSince I aimed for (3, 9) and ended at (3, 8): I must have eaten something at (3, 8) or the apple list was wrong. Since the T4 board shows A at (3, 9), the apple is still there.\n\n**The only viable interpretation leading to the T4 board state:**\n1. T3 Start: Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 6)]. Score 1.\n2. T3 Move: UP $\\rightarrow$ (3, 8).\n3. Snake #0 Move: (4, 4) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 4) [RIGHT, pursuing (6, 5)].\n4. *Crucially*: The board shows an apple 'A' at (3, 9) and '1' at (3, 8). The snake head is '1'. If the score is 2, I must have eaten. Since (3, 9) is still there, I must have eaten an apple that was at (3, 8) *previously*\u2014but the T3 apple list did not have one there.\n\nLet's rely purely on the **T4 Starting State**: Head (3, 8), Body [(3, 7), (3, 6)]. Score 2. Enemy Head (5, 4). Apples: (1, 8), (0, 4), (5, 1), (6, 5), (3, 9).\n\nMy Goal remains (3, 9) (1 step away).\nSafety Check at (3, 8):\n1. **DOWN to (3, 7):** Collision with Body segment (3, 7). **DEAD.** Must avoid.\n2. **UP to (3, 9):** Targets apple. Safe from self.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe from self.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Safe from self.\n\nEnemy Head (5, 4).\nCollision Check against (5, 4):\n*   UP to (3, 9): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (2, 8): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe.\n\nApple Targeting: (3, 9) is 1 step away UP. This is the highest priority.\n\nEnemy Prediction (Snake #0 at (5, 4)): Closest apple is (6, 5) (Distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$) or (5, 1) (Distance $\\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$). (6, 5) is the target.\n#0 likely moves UP/RIGHT towards (6, 5). Possible moves: (5, 5) [UP], or (6, 4) [RIGHT].\nIf #0 moves to (5, 5): No collision with my move UP to (3, 9).\nIf #0 moves to (6, 4): No collision with my move UP to (3, 9).\n\nMoving UP to (3, 9) secures the second apple (Score 3). This is the clearly dominant move. If I ate, my tail (3, 6) would drop, resulting in Body [(3, 7), (3, 8)].\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat (3, 9) now. Then assess remaining apples: (1, 8) is next closest (Distance $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ from (3, 9)). The game is still in the early phase, focus purely on eating available apples safely. If the enemy targets (1, 8) after eating, I may need to adjust trajectory to get there first or secure the safer apples further out before they grow large.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",
