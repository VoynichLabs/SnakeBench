          "rationale": "**Analysis and Move Decision:**\n\n**Enemy Snake Consideration:**  \nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,0) with no body. It is far from me (at 2,6). It has not moved yet (turn 0), and we are moving simultaneously. I must consider where it might move next, but since it's turn 0, I have no past behavior to predict. However, being at the bottom right corner (9,0), it likely wants to move towards apples. Apples near it: (9,4) is far, (0,0) is far left, (4,2) is moderate. It could move UP or LEFT. Moving UP to (9,1) would be safe for now, moving LEFT to (8,0) also safe. It might head towards the central apples or the apple at (9,4). I need to avoid being in a position where on the next turn, its head could collide with my body or head. Since my body is only my head currently (no tail), the only immediate danger is if its head moves into my current head position (2,6) this turn, which is unlikely given its distance. So no immediate threat from collision this turn.\n\n**My Snake's Position:**  \nHead at (2,6), body none. Apples: 0. Board is 10x10. Apples are scattered. I need to collect apples to grow and score. I should prioritize safe apples that are reachable without risking immediate death.\n\n**Potential Moves from (2,6):**\n- UP: to (2,7) \u2013 check board: row 7 (y=7) has A? From board, row 7 (index 7): \". . . . . . . . . . .\" (all dots). So (2,7) is empty, no apple. Is it safe? No other snake bodies. But I must consider future: moving up might lead me towards apples at (3,9), (1,8), (0,9) etc. However, from (2,7) I could go further up to (2,8) which is empty (row 8: \". A . . A . . . . .\"), then (2,9) which is empty? Row 9: \"A . . A . . A . . .\" \u2013 (2,9) is '.'? Actually row 9: col 0: A, 1: ., 2: ., 3: A, 4: ., 5: ., 6: A, 7: ., 8: ., 9: . So (2,9) is '.' (safe). But there are apples at (1,8), (3,9), (0,9). Moving up might go towards those. However, from (2,6) to (2,7) is moving away from some apples like (1,6) which is directly left at (1,6) \u2013 that's an apple! Wait, from board: row 6: \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" That means at y=6, x=0: '.'? Actually row 6: col 0: '.'? The board shows: \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" So indices: col 0: '.'? Actually the string is \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" so col 0: space? No, let's parse properly: The row string for y=6 is \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" So columns: 0: '.'? Wait, the board is given as:\n\n9 A . . A . . A . . .\n8 . A . . A . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\n5 A . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . A . A\n3 A . . A . . . . . .\n2 . A . . A . . . . .\n1 A . . . . . . . . .\n0 A . . . . . . . . 0\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo row 6 (y=6): at x=0: '.'? Actually the first character is a space? No, the formatting might be off. Looking at the row: \"6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\" Typically, the row label is \"6\" then the cells. So cells: x=0: '.' (dot), x=1: 'A', x=2: '1' (my head), x=3: '.' etc. So indeed, there is an apple at (1,6)! That's adjacent to my head at (2,6). I can move LEFT to (1,6) and eat an apple immediately, growing my snake to length 2. That seems highly beneficial. However, I must check if it's safe: moving left to (1,6) \u2013 is there any snake body? My body is none, enemy snake at (9,0). No issue. Is there any risk of collision this turn? Enemy snake moves simultaneously. Could enemy snake move into (1,6) this turn? No, enemy is at (9,0), can only move one cell, so max distance is 1, so impossible. So moving left is safe and gains an apple. Also, after eating, I will have a body segment at (2,6) and head at (1,6). That opens up future moves.\n\n**Other Moves:**  \n- RIGHT: to (3,6) \u2013 board shows (3,6) is '.' (row 6: after '1' at x=2, x=3 is '.'). No apple. This moves me further from the apple at (1,6). Not optimal.\n- DOWN: to (2,5) \u2013 board row 5: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so (2,5) is '.'? Actually row 5: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so x=0: 'A', x=1: '.', x=2: '.'? Wait, after \"A .\" there is space? The string \"A . . . . . . . . .\" means cells: 0: 'A', 1: '.', 2: '.', 3: '.', etc. So (2,5) is '.' (safe). No apple. But (2,5) is near apple at (0,5) (left) and (1,2) etc. However, moving down from (2,6) to (2,5) is moving away from (1,6) apple.\n- UP: to (2,7) \u2013 no apple, as noted.\n\nThus, moving LEFT to (1,6) is the best immediate move: it collects an apple, increases score, and grows my snake. It also keeps options open: after eating, from (1,6) I have possible moves: UP to (1,7) (empty), RIGHT to (2,6) (my body, but that would be moving backwards into my own body? Actually, after eating, my body will be at (2,6) and tail will be there (since I grow). If I move RIGHT from (1,6) to (2,6), that's moving into my own body (the cell that was my previous head). That is considered hitting myself and I would die. So after eating, I cannot immediately move back right. That's fine; I'll have other options.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating the apple at (1,6), I'll have length 2. I should consider moving towards other apples. There are apples at (0,5) (down-left), (1,2) (down), (0,3) etc. I need to avoid getting trapped by the enemy snake. The enemy snake might head towards the center or top-left apples. I should try to secure a cluster of apples while staying safe. Since the game is 150 turns, I have time to grow.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move LEFT to (1,6).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "The enemy snake is at (9,0), far away. My head is at (2,6), body at (2,6) (wait, body is [(2,6)]? Actually the state says \"Body: [(2,6)]\" and head is (1,6). But the board shows head at (1,6) and body at (2,6)? Let's check: Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (1,6), Body: [(2,6)] - that means the body is the segment directly behind the head. So my snake is currently at head (1,6) with a tail segment at (2,6). Wait, but earlier it said \"My snake (ID: 1): Head: (1,6), Body: [(2,6)]\". That means the body list is ordered head-to-tail, so first tuple is head: (1,6), then body segment: (2,6). So the tail is at (2,6). So the snake occupies cells (1,6) and (2,6). The board representation shows \"1 T\" at (2,6) and head at (1,6) as \"1\"? Actually board row 6: \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" So (1,6) is 'A'? Wait, the board row 6: \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" Let's index columns 0-9: col0: '.', col1: 'A', col2: '1', col3: '.', etc. So (1,6) is col1: 'A'? But our head is at (1,6) according to the snake state. That suggests an inconsistency. Possibly the board uses '1' to denote the head? In the board, at (2,6) there is '1'? Actually the board shows at (2,6) '1'? Let's re-examine the board:\n\nRow 6: \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" So at x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: '1', x=3: '.' etc. So according to this, the snake head is at (2,6) not (1,6). But the snake state says head is (1,6) and body includes (2,6). That would mean the head is at (1,6) and body at (2,6), but the board shows '1' at (2,6) and 'A' at (1,6). So perhaps the board's '1' denotes the head, and 'A' is an apple. So the snake state must be: head at (2,6) and body at (1,6) or something? But the state explicitly says head (1,6) and body [(2,6)]. Could be a formatting issue: maybe the board row 6 is \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" meaning the first character is a space? Let's read the provided board state carefully:\n\nBoard state:\n 9 A . . A . . A . . .\n 8 . A . . A . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . A . .\n 6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\n 5 A . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . A . A\n 3 A . . A . . . . . .\n 2 . A . . A . . . . .\n 1 A . . . . . . . . 0\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nRow 6: \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" So after the row label \"6\", there is a space, then characters: '.'? Actually the string might be: \"6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\" That is typical: the row number, then a space, then the cells. So the cells are: cell0: '.', cell1: 'A', cell2: '1', cell3: '.', etc. So the snake's head (denoted by '1') is at (2,6). The apple at (1,6) is shown as 'A'. The snake's body is not shown because it's just the head? But the snake state says body is [(2,6)]? That can't be because (2,6) is the head. Actually, the snake state says: Head: (1,6), Body: [(2,6)]. That would mean the body is at (2,6) and head at (1,6). But the board shows '1' at (2,6) not at (1,6). So there's a mismatch. Possibly the snake state is reversed? Let's check the apple list: (1,2) is an apple, etc. The board shows 'A' at many places. The head is marked '1' on the board. So the head is at (2,6). The body, if any, would be at (1,6) or elsewhere. But the snake state says body is [(2,6)], which is the same as head, meaning no body? Actually a body list of length 1 means the snake has only a head and no tail? That would be impossible because a snake of length 1 would have only head, no body. The state says \"Body: [(2,6)]\". That likely means the body (segments) are listed after the head. So if head is (1,6) and body is [(2,6)], then the snake occupies (1,6) and (2,6). But the board shows '1' at (2,6) and 'A' at (1,6). That suggests the board might be showing the snake's body as '1'? Typically in snake games, the head is marked specially, but here the board shows '1' for the snake's head. So perhaps the snake's head is at (2,6) and the body at (1,6) is not shown because it's not part of the board representation? But the board shows '.' or 'A' for all cells. It doesn't show body segments except the head? In the board state, they only show the head of each snake as a digit (0 or 1). The body is not depicted. That makes sense: the board only shows apples and the heads of snakes. The body is implicit from the snake's state list. So in the board, '1' is the head of snake 1, and '0' is the head of snake 0. The apple symbols 'A' are apples. Everything else is '.' for empty.\n\nThus, the board shows the head at (2,6) as '1', but the snake state says head at (1,6). That is contradictory. Let's re-check the snake state for ID 1:\n\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (1, 6)\n  - Body: [(2, 6)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nSo according to the state, the head is at (1,6), body includes (2,6). But the board shows '1' at (2,6). Possibly the board's '1' is at (1,6)? Let's parse row 6 carefully: The row string is \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" If we index columns starting from 0, after the row label \"6\", there is a space, then the first character is '.'? Actually the row might be: \"6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\" So after \"6\" there is a space, then the cell for x=0 is '.'? But the string \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" has a leading dot? The representation might be: \"6 . A 1 . . . . . . .\" That means cell0: '.' (x=0), cell1: 'A' (x=1), cell2: '1' (x=2). So indeed the head is at (2,6). So the snake state must be wrong? Or maybe the head is at (1,6) and the board's '1' is at (1,6)? But then cell2 would be something else. Let's count characters: \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" That's 10 characters: 0: '.', 1: 'A', 2: '1', 3: '.', 4: '.', 5: '.', 6: '.', 7: '.', 8: '.', 9: '.'? Actually there are 10 cells: positions 0-9. The string has a dot at start, then space? The representation is ambiguous.\n\nGiven the board shows '1' at (2,6) and snake state says head at (1,6), I suspect the snake state might have swapped head and body. But the state is provided by the system, so I should trust the state over the board for exact coordinates. However, the board is also part of the state. I need to resolve this.\n\nLook at the apple list: (1,8), (0,0), (3,9), (9,4), (1,2), (6,9), (3,3), (0,5), (4,2), (7,4), (0,9), (0,1), (0,3), (4,8), (7,7). Notice (1,6) is not in the apple list, but (1,2) is. The board shows an apple at (1,6)? Row 6, col1 is 'A', so (1,6) is an apple. That apple is not listed in the apples at? The apples at list includes 15 apples. Let's list them: (1,8), (0,0), (3,9), (9,4), (1,2), (6,9), (3,3), (0,5), (4,2), (7,4), (0,9), (0,1), (0,3), (4,8), (7,7). That's 15 apples. The board shows many 'A's, likely all apples. Does (1,6) appear? Not in the list. So (1,6) is not an apple. But the board shows 'A' at (1,6) according to my parsing. Could be that the board's 'A' at (1,6) is actually the head '1'? Let's consider: If the head is at (1,6), then the board should show '1' at (1,6). In row 6, after \"6\", the cells: first cell (x=0) is '.'? second cell (x=1) is 'A'? third cell (x=2) is '1'? So that would put head at (2,6). To have head at (1,6), the string would need to be something like \". 1 A ...\" but it's not.\n\nMaybe the row 6 is \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" and the spaces are separators? Actually the board is formatted with spaces between characters, so \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" means there is a space, then a dot, then space, then A, then space, then 1, etc. So the actual sequence of characters (ignoring spaces) is: . A 1 . . . . . . . So indeed the head is at position 2 (x=2). So the head is at (2,6). The body is at (1,6) according to the state? But the state says body is [(2,6)], which is the same as head. That can't be. Perhaps the state's \"Body: [(2,6)]\" means the body is a single segment at (2,6) and the head is at (1,6)? That would be a snake of length 2 with head at (1,6) and body at (2,6). The board doesn't show body segments, only head. So the board shows the head as '1' at (2,6) if that is where the head is, but it's not. Alternatively, maybe the board shows the snake's head as '1' at (1,6) and the apple at (1,6) is not shown because it's overlapped? But apples are removed when eaten, and we have 1 apple collected, so the apple at (1,6) might have been eaten? But the apple list doesn't include (1,6), so there is no apple at (1,6). The board shows an 'A' at (1,6) which would be an apple, but the apple list doesn't have it. So the board might be outdated? Or the board is correct and the snake state is wrong? I need to trust the snake state because it's the explicit state provided for my snake.\n\nLet's examine the board again for other clues. Row 1 (y=1): \"1 A . . . . . . . 0\" So at y=1, x=0: '1'? Actually row 1: \"1 A . . . . . . . 0\" That means (0,1) is '1'? That would be a head of snake 1 at (0,1)? But our snake head is at (1,6) or (2,6). That doesn't match. Wait, row 1 is y=1? The row label is \"1\". So row 1 (y=1) cells: first cell (x=0) is '1', second (x=1) is 'A', third (x=2) is '.', etc., last (x=9) is '0'. So that shows head of snake 1 at (0,1)? That would contradict both previous possibilities. This is confusing.\n\nLet's list all row strings:\n\nRow 9: \" A . . A . . A . . .\"   (y=9)\nRow 8: \" . A . . A . . . . .\" (y=8)\nRow 7: \" . . . . . . . . . .\" (y=7)\nRow 6: \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" (y=6)\nRow 5: \" A . . . . . . . . .\" (y=5)\nRow 4: \" . . . . . . . A . A\" (y=4)\nRow 3: \" A . . A . . . . . .\" (y=3)\nRow 2: \" . A . . A . . . . .\" (y=2)\nRow 1: \" 1 A . . . . . . . 0\" (y=1)\nRow 0: \" A . . . . . . . . .\" (y=0)\n\nCoordinates: x from 0 to 9 left to right.\n\nNow, for snake 1 (ID 1), the snake state says head at (1,6) and body at (2,6). According to the board, at y=6 (row 6), we have characters: x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: '1', x=3: '.', ... So the head is shown as '1' at (2,6). That suggests that the snake's head is actually at (2,6). The body at (1,6) would be an apple 'A' on the board, but the board shows an apple there. That apple might have been eaten? But the apple list does not include (1,6). So it's still an apple. So if the body is at (1,6), that cell would have a body segment, but the board shows 'A', which is an apple. That can't be; you can't have both an apple and a body segment in the same cell. Unless the apple was not yet eaten and the body segment is there, but the board would show either 'A' or the snake, not both. Typically the board shows the snake head as a digit and other cells as apples or dots, not showing snake body. So the board might not show body segments at all. Therefore, the body at (1,6) would be hidden, and the board might still show 'A' if an apple is present, but that would be incorrect because the apple should disappear when the snake occupies it? Actually, when a snake eats an apple, the apple disappears and the snake grows. So if the snake body moves onto an apple, the apple is eaten and the snake grows. So if the body is at (1,6) and there is an apple there, the apple would have been eaten earlier, and the snake would have grown. But the snake has collected 1 apple, and the body is at (2,6) according to the state? Wait, the state says body is [(2,6)], not (1,6). Let's read the state again: \"Body: [(2,6)]\". That means the body is a list containing one segment at (2,6). The head is at (1,6). So the snake occupies (1,6) and (2,6). Which cell has an apple? The board shows at (1,6) an 'A'. That suggests there is an apple at (1,6) that hasn't been eaten. But the snake's head is at (1,6), so if the head moves onto an apple, it would eat it. At the start of turn 1, the snake's head is at (1,6) according to the state, but the board shows 'A' at (1,6). That means the head is on an apple? That would mean the apple is there, but the snake hasn't eaten it yet. However, the snake has collected 1 apple, so maybe that apple was collected earlier, and the board is not updated? The board state is supposed to reflect the current board, including apples and snake heads. If the snake's head is on an apple, the apple would be gone, and the board would show the head instead of 'A'. But the board shows 'A' at (1,6) and '1' at (2,6). That suggests the head is at (2,6) and the apple is at (1,6). So the snake state must be wrong: the head is at (2,6) and the body is at (1,6) (or possibly empty). However, the state says body is [(2,6)], which is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the confusion, I need to rely on the board for visual representation and the snake state for head and body positions. The board shows '1' at (2,6), which likely is the head of snake 1. The snake state says head is (1,6), but that might be a typo or mislabel. The body list is [(2,6)], which would be the same as head if head is (1,6) and body is (2,6), but then the board shows head at (2,6). Perhaps the state's \"Head: (1,6)\" is actually the tail? No, the state says \"Head: (1,6)\" clearly.\n\nLet's look at the enemy snake: Snake #0 has head at (9,1) and no body. The board shows at row 1, x=9: '0'. That matches. So for snake 0, the board shows '0' at its head, and no body shown. For snake 1, the board shows '1' at (2,6), which should be its head. Therefore, I think the snake state has a mistake: the head is actually at (2,6), not (1,6). The body might be empty, but the state says body is [(2,6)]. That doesn't make sense. Possibly the body is empty and the list is a placeholder? Or the body is [(1,6)]? The board shows 'A' at (1,6), which is an apple. So the body cannot be there because that would be an apple. So the snake likely has only a head and no body (length 1). But the state says body is [(2,6)], which would be the head itself. That is weird.\n\nGiven the apple at (1,6) and the head at (2,6), the snake can move left to (1,6) to eat the apple. That is what I did in my last move (LEFT). But according to the state, my head is at (1,6) already? No, the state says head at (1,6), so moving left from (1,6) would go to (0,6), which is '.' according to row 6, x=0 is '.'. That is not an apple. So if I move left from (1,6) to (0,6), I wouldn't get an apple. But there is an apple at (1,6) according to the board, but if my head is already at (1,6), then I'm standing on an apple, which should have been eaten already, so there should be no apple there. The board shows 'A' at (1,6), meaning there is an apple. So my head cannot be at (1,6). Therefore, the head must be at (2,6). So I will assume the head is at (2,6) and the body is empty or at (1,6) if the snake has length 2, but the apple at (1,6) suggests it's not occupied. To reconcile, perhaps the snake has just eaten the apple at (1,6) on the previous move, so the apple is gone, but the board hasn't been updated? The board is provided as current state, so it should be up to date.\n\nLet's check the turn: Turn 1 / 150. My last move was LEFT. That means on turn 0, I moved LEFT. From what position? I don't know my starting position on turn 0. The state shows current positions (after move?). The \"Your last move information\" says I picked LEFT. So on turn 0, I chose LEFT. The current state is after that move? Or before my move for turn 1? The turn is 1, so I am about to make my move for turn 1. The state shown is the board at the beginning of turn 1, after the previous moves have been executed. So after my last move (LEFT), my head is now at (1,6) according to the snake state, and the apple at (1,6) would have been eaten, so it should not appear on the board. But the board shows 'A' at (1,6). That indicates that the board might be before my move? Or perhaps the apple was not eaten because I didn't move onto it? If I moved left from some position, and ended up at (1,6), and there was an apple there, I would have eaten it, and the apple should disappear. But it's still showing. Therefore, either the board is not updated, or I didn't eat an apple because the apple wasn't there, or my head is not at (1,6). \n\nGiven the inconsistencies, I need to make a decision based on the most reliable information. The board is visual and shows apples and snake heads. The snake state is explicit but may have errors. I will trust the board for apple locations and snake head positions. The board shows:\n- Snake 1 head at (2,6)\n- Apple at (1,6)\n- Snake 0 head at (9,1)\n- No other bodies shown.\n\nTherefore, my head is at (2,6). I can move LEFT to (1,6) to eat the apple. That is a good move. However, I must consider if moving left is safe given my own body. If my snake has a body, moving left might be into my own body. But the board doesn't show my body, and the snake state says body is [(2,6)], which is my current head. That suggests no body. So moving left should be safe. But wait, if my body is empty, then the snake is length 1, so there is no body to collide with. However, if I eat an apple, I will grow, and my body will become (2,6) after the move? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow at the tail. If you are length 1 (only head), after eating, you become length 2: head at new position, tail at old head position. So if I move from (2,6) to (1,6) and eat an apple, my new body will be [ (2,6) ] (old head becomes body). That matches the snake state? The snake state currently says body is [(2,6)], which is consistent if my head was at (1,6) before? No.\n\nLet's assume the current state is at the beginning of turn 1. My head is at (2,6) (from board). My body is empty (since board shows no body, and snake state may be wrong). I have collected 1 apple already (from the snake state). That means I have already eaten one apple previously, so my snake might be length 2 or more. If I have one apple, my length is 2 (head + one body). The body should be at some position. The snake state says body is [(2,6)], which would be the same as head if head is at (1,6), but not if head is at (2,6). So maybe the body is at (1,6) and the head is at (2,6). That would make sense: head at (2,6), body at (1,6). Then the board shows an apple at (1,6) but that cell is occupied by my body, so it shouldn't show an apple. Again, inconsistency.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the board's indication: head at (2,6), apple at (1,6). I will move LEFT to eat the apple. That is likely correct.\n\nNow, considering enemy snake: at (9,1). It can move UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0), LEFT to (8,1), RIGHT to (9,2) (same as UP). It is unlikely to move into my path. My move to (1,6) is safe.\n\nAfter eating, my new head at (1,6), body at (2,6). I'll have length 2. Then for future moves, I can consider other apples.\n\nThus, I'll move LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the last move I made was LEFT (according to the last move information). That was on turn 0. Now on turn 1, I need to make a new move. I can't move left again if it would go into my own body? After eating, my body will be at (2,6), so moving left from (1,6) would go to (0,6), which is safe (empty). But moving left again might not be optimal. However, I am deciding for turn 1 now, so I need to choose a move based on current state (before my move). The current state is before my turn 1 move. So I should decide now.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume my head is at (2,6) and body is at (1,6) (since I have 1 apple, length 2). The board shows apple at (1,6) but that might be an error. Actually, if my body is at (1,6), there cannot be an apple there. So the apple at (1,6) is likely not there. The board might be showing the apple that I haven't eaten yet at (1,6)? But if I already ate one apple, maybe I haven't eaten the apple at (1,6). The apple list does not include (1,6), so there is no apple at (1,6). The board's 'A' at (1,6) might be a mistake. Looking at the apple list, there is no (1,6). So the board should not have an apple at (1,6). Therefore, the 'A' at (1,6) might actually be the head of snake 1? But the head is marked '1' at (2,6). So the 'A' at (1,6) is likely an apple from the list? But (1,6) is not in the list. So it's not an apple. Maybe the board row string is misaligned. Let's re-evaluate row 6 string: \". A 1 . . . . . . .\" If we index from 0, maybe the first character is a space? The string might be \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" with a leading space. So after removing spaces, we have characters: (maybe index 0 is space, then 1 is '.', 2 is 'A', 3 is '1', 4 is '.', ...). That would put the head at x=3? That seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll base my decision on the apple list and the board's visible apples. The board shows many 'A's, which likely correspond to the apples in the list. Let's see if (1,6) is in the apple list: it is not. So maybe the 'A' at (1,6) is actually a '.' misinterpreted? Could be that the row is \" . A 1 . . . . . . .\" and the first character is a space, so the cells are: space, '.', 'A', '1', '.', ... So the apple is at x=2? No.\n\nI think the safest approach is to trust the snake state's head position for move decisions. The snake state says head is at (1,6). Therefore, my current head is at (1,6). My body is at (2,6). That means I am occupying (1,6) and (2,6). The apple at (1,6) cannot exist because I'm on it. So the board's 'A' at (1,6) is likely a visual artifact; maybe it's the head '1' but represented as 'A' due to formatting? Actually, the head is shown as '1' on the board at (2,6). So the board is consistent with head at (2,6). Therefore, I think the snake state's head is wrong, and the correct head is (2,6). I'll go with the board.\n\nThus, I will move LEFT to (1,6) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I must also consider if moving left is safe in terms of collision with my own body. If my head is at (2,6) and body is at (1,6), moving left to (1,6) would be moving into my own body, which is fatal. However, if I have just eaten an apple, my body might be longer, but the snake state says body is [(2,6)], which is the same as head if head is at (1,6). If head is at (2,6), body being [(2,6)] doesn't make sense. So perhaps my body is actually empty, and the snake state is just listing the head as body? That is unlikely.\n\nGiven the time, I'll assume my snake has only a head at (2,6) and no body (since I have 1 apple, I should have a body, but maybe the apple was collected earlier and the body is at a different position not shown). The board doesn't show body, so I can't tell. To be safe, I'll check other moves that don't risk moving into my own body. If I have no body, all moves are safe. If I have a body, moving left might be into my body if body is at (1,6). But the board shows 'A' at (1,6), not a body. So likely there is no body there. Therefore, moving left is safe.\n\nI'll go with LEFT.\n\nFinal answer: LEFT.LEFT",

Therefore, my actual head is at (2,6) and my body is not at (1,6) (or the body is elsewhere). The apple at (1,6) is likely still there and not eaten, meaning I have not collected it yet. Since my previous move was LEFT, I moved from (2,6) to (1,6) and ate the apple, growing and now my head should be at (1,6) and body at (2,6). However, the next turn's state (turn 2) shows the same head and body positions as turn 1, which suggests the state hasn't updated or there is a discrepancy. To resolve, I'll assume my head is at (2,6) and the apple at (1,6) is still present. Moving LEFT to (1,6) will eat that apple, giving me a point and growing. This move is safe because there is no body at (1,6) (the board shows '.' at (1,6) in the current board state, not 'A'). I should also consider the enemy snake at (9,2) which is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nMoving LEFT is the best move to gain an apple and grow. Other moves: UP to (2,7) is empty (board row 7 at col2 is '.'), but moving up doesn't get an apple immediately. DOWN to (2,5) is '.' (row 5 col2 is '.'). RIGHT to (3,6) is '.' (row 6 col3 is '.'). LEFT is the only move that leads to an apple this turn. So I choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",
