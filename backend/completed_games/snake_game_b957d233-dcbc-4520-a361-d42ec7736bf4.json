The enemy snake #1 head is at (0, 8), which is directly below my position at (0, 9).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- UP: Invalid (off board)\n- LEFT: Invalid (off board)\n- RIGHT: Invalid (into my own body at (1, 9))\n- DOWN: Would move to (0, 8) where enemy snake #1 is currently\n\nSince the enemy snake will also move simultaneously, I need to consider what they might do. However, regardless of what they do, moving DOWN into their current position would result in a collision if they stay or move into that space.\n\nLet me reconsider... Actually, wait. Looking more carefully at the RIGHT move:\n\nIf I'm at (0, 9) and my body is at (1, 9), moving RIGHT would take me to (1, 9) which IS where my body is. This would definitely kill me.\n\nBut actually, let me reconsider the DOWN move. The enemy snake is at (0, 8). They could move UP to (0, 9) (which is where I am now), or LEFT to (-1, 8) (invalid), or RIGHT to (1, 8), or DOWN to (0, 7).\n\nIf they move UP to (0, 9), we'd have a head-on collision and both die.\nIf they move RIGHT to (1, 8), then (0, 8) would be safe for me.\nIf they move DOWN to (0, 7), then (0, 8) would be safe for me.\nIf they try to move LEFT to (-1, 8), that's invalid.\n\nSo moving DOWN has a chance of success if the enemy moves away from (0, 8).\n\n**Conclusion:** I only have one potentially viable move: DOWN. RIGHT is definitely into my own body, UP and LEFT are off the board. DOWN has risk but is the only move that might work.\n\nDOWN",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best move for my snake (ID 1) on this turn. The board is 10x10. Let me start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake's head is at (0,7). It has no body, so just the head. Apples collected 0. The enemy snake (0) has head at (0,8), body at (0,9), and has collected 1 apple. The apples on the board are at (6,0), (8,5), (9,8), (7,3), (2,3). \n\nThe last move was DOWN. Just last turn I moved down from (0,7) to (0,8)? Wait, wait. Wait, last move was DOWN. So my previous position was (0,7), then moving down would take me to (1,7) since y increases upwards. Wait, the coordinate system says that increasing y is up. So moving down would decrease y? Or wait, the problem states: \"Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\" So moving down is y decreases, up is y increases. So if my head was at (0,7), moving down would take me to (0,6). Because y decreases as you go down. \n\nWait, let me confirm. The board is displayed with 0 at the bottom. The display shows:\n\n9 T . . . . . . . . .\n8 0 . . . . . . . . A\n7 1 . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . A .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . A . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo line 8 (the top line is 9?), each line represents a y-coordinate. So line 0 is the bottom (y=0), line 9 is the top (y=9). So, for example, the apple at (8,5) is in row 5, which is the line labeled 5. \n\nSo, moving down is decreasing y. So from (0,7), moving down would go to (0,6) or (1,7)? Wait, no. Because x and y are coordinates. So moving down would be in the negative y direction. So if my head is at (0,7), moving down would take me to (0,6), then (0,5), etc. Because y decreases as you go down. \n\nThe last move was DOWN. So last turn, my head was at some position, and I moved down. Let me check that. The last move was DOWN. The previous position before moving down would have been (0,8), because moving down (y decreases by 1) from (0,8) would take me to (0,7) for this turn. Wait, no. Wait, each move is in a direction. So when you move DOWN, you decrease y by 1. So if my previous position was (0,8) and I moved down, my new head position is (0,7), which matches the current head position. That makes sense. \n\nSo my previous position was (0,8), then I moved down to (0,7) this turn. So that was my last move. \n\nNow, I need to choose the next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nFirst, I need to eliminate any moves that would immediately kill me. \n\nPossible moves:\n\n1. UP: from (0,7) move to (0,8). Are there any issues here? Let's check if (0,8) is occupied by another snake's body or head. \n\nLooking at the board, snake #0's head is at (0,8), and their body is [(0,9)]. So if I move up to (0,8), which is snake #0's head's current position. But since all snakes move simultaneously, the collision would happen if my new head position is into any snake's body (including their new positions after they move). Wait, the collision rules state: \n\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains. If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die. Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nWait, but during a turn, both snakes move. So when moving, all heads move. So when checking for collisions, do we consider the new positions after all have moved?\n\nThe problem says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So I think the collision is checked based on the new positions after moving. So when all snakes have moved, if any of the new head positions are in any snake's body (including their own), then death occurs. \n\nSo when considering possible moves, I need to check after moving, where would my head be, and whether that cell is part of any snake's body (including their new positions) after all have moved. \n\nBut since I can't know where the enemy snake will move, except that they might move in a way that their body is in certain positions. This complicates things. \n\nFor example, if I move up to (0,8), which is currently the enemy's head. But if the enemy snake moves in a direction that their head is no longer at (0,8), then maybe it's safe. But if they stay there, then I would collide with their body? Or wait, their head is moving. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the enemy snake's body is [(0,9)] and head at (0,8). If they move up, their new head would be (0,9), and their body would be the previous head (0,8). So if I move up to (0,8), that cell would be part of the enemy's new body. So my head would be in their body, which is a collision. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves down, their head would go to (0,7), which is my current position, but since all move simultaneously, maybe that's a collision between our heads? Because both are moving into (0,7). \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nSo for each possible move I can make, I need to check:\n\n- Will my new head position be outside the board? For up, from (0,7) moving up would go to (0,8). 8 is within 0-9, so y=8 is okay. \n\n- Will my new head position be into any snake's body (after all snakes have moved). \n\nBut since I don't know the enemy's move, this is tricky. However, the enemy's possible moves are also constrained by their own survival. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model possible enemy moves and see if any of them would result in a collision. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that the enemy will try to survive as well. \n\nBut for the purpose of this turn, I need to make a move that doesn't immediately kill me. \n\nLet's check each possible direction:\n\n1. UP: new head at (0,8). \n\n snake #0's current head is at (0,8). If I move up to (0,8), which is where their head is. But when all move, their head will move. Suppose enemy snake moves in some direction. For example, if they move up, their new head is (0,9). Then, their body would be (0,8) (their previous head). So my new head (0,8) would be in their body. That's a collision. \n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves down, their head goes to (0,7), which is my current position. Then, our heads would be moving into (0,7) and (0,7), causing a head-on collision. \n\nBut in any case, if I move up to (0,8), and the enemy's body is now at (0,8) (if they moved), then I would die. But if the enemy moves away, maybe not. However, since I can't predict their exact move, moving up might be risky. \n\nAnother option: moving up could lead to collision if the enemy's body is in (0,8) after they move. \n\nBut since the enemy's current body is (0,9), and their head is (0,8). If they move up, their new head is (0,9), and their body is (0,8). So if I move to (0,8), that's their body. So collision. \n\nIf they move down, their head goes to (0,7). Then, my move to (0,8) is safe. But their body would be (0,8) (previous head). So my head is at (0,8), which is not in their body. So no collision. \n\nBut since I can't know their direction, moving up could be risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy will not move up, because moving up would require them to go to (0,9), which is possible. But their body is (0,9), so if they move up, their new head is (0,9), and their body is (0,8). \n\nIn that case, my head at (0,8) would be in their body. So that's a collision. \n\nSo moving up is dangerous because if the enemy moves up, I die. \n\nBut maybe the enemy won't move up. But I can't assume that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safest way is to avoid moving into any position that could be part of the enemy's possible body. \n\nSo moving up is risky. \n\n2. DOWN: new head at (0,6). \n\nCheck if (0,6) is safe. The current apples are at (6,0), (8,5), (9,8), (7,3), (2,3). \n\nSo (0,6) is not an apple. \n\nIs (0,6) part of any snake's body? The enemy's body is (0,9). So (0,6) is empty. So moving down would be safe in terms of body collision. \n\nBut what about other snakes? There are no other snakes. So moving down is safe. \n\n3. LEFT: new head at (-1,7) which is off the board. Since x ranges from 0-9. So moving left is invalid. So this move is invalid. \n\n4. RIGHT: new head at (1,7). \n\nCheck if (1,7) is safe. The enemy's body is at (0,9), so (1,7) is empty. So no collision. \n\nSo possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid. \n\nNow, among UP, DOWN, RIGHT, which is the safest? \n\nUP is risky because if enemy moves up, I die. \n\nDOWN: safe, but perhaps moving towards the apple at (7,3) which is at (7,3). Wait, apple at (7,3) is in row 3, which is the line labeled 3. So (7,3) is x=7, y=3. \n\nMy current head is at (0,7). Moving down would take me to (0,6), then next to (0,5), etc. The apple at (7,3) is quite far. Maybe moving right could be better to approach that apple? \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,5) is at x=8, y=5. \n\nSo perhaps moving right could help get towards that apple. \n\nBut I need to choose between UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\nLet me think about each option. \n\nOption UP: (0,8). Risks collision with enemy's body if they move up. But if they move down, then their body is (0,8) (previous head), so my head is at (0,8) which is their body. So collision. Wait, no. If enemy moves down, their head goes to (0,7). Then their body is (0,8). So my head is at (0,8), which is their body. So collision. \n\nWait, that's a problem. If I move up to (0,8), regardless of what the enemy does, their body will be at (0,8) if they move down. Because their previous head is (0,8), and if they move down, their new head is (0,7), and their body is the previous head (0,8). So if I move to (0,8), that's their body. So collision. \n\nSo moving up would definitely result in collision with enemy's body. Because even if they move down, their body is (0,8), which is where I'm moving. \n\nSo moving up is a losing move. Because regardless of the enemy's move, after they move, their body would include (0,8) if they move down. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nEnemies current position: head at (0,8), body at (0,9). \n\nIf enemy moves up: new head (0,9), body becomes [ (0,8) ]. So my head at (0,8) is in their body. Collision. \n\nIf enemy moves down: new head (0,7), body is (0,8). So my head is at (0,8), which is their body. Collision. \n\nIf enemy moves left or right: suppose they move left to (-1,8) which is invalid, so they would die. But they wouldn't choose that. \n\nSo enemy's possible moves are up, down, left (invalid), right. \n\nIf enemy moves left, they die. So they won't. \n\nIf enemy moves right, new head (1,8), body (0,8). So my head at (0,8) is not in their body. \n\nWait, if enemy moves right, their new head is (1,8), body is (0,8). So my head is at (0,8) which is their body. So collision. \n\nWait, no. If I move up to (0,8), and enemy moves right to (1,8), then their body is (0,8). So my head is in their body. Collision. \n\nSo in all possible enemy moves except if they move right and I move up, it's a collision. \n\nWait, enemy can't move left (invalid). So possible enemy moves are up, down, right. \n\nIn all cases, moving up by me would result in my head being in the enemy's body. Because:\n\n- If enemy moves up: body is (0,8) (previous head). \n\n- If enemy moves down: body is (0,8) (previous head). \n\n- If enemy moves right: body is (0,8) (previous head). \n\nSo in all cases, moving up would result in my head being in their body. So moving up is a guaranteed death. \n\nTherefore, UP is invalid. \n\nSo possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT. \n\nNow between DOWN and RIGHT. \n\nDOWN: moving to (0,6). \n\nRIGHT: moving to (1,7). \n\nWhich is better? \n\nLet's think about the apples. The apples are at (6,0), (8,5), (9,8), (7,3), (2,3). \n\nMy current position is (0,7). \n\nIf I move down (y decreases), I can go towards lower y values. The apple at (7,3) is at y=3, which is lower. So if I keep moving down, maybe I can reach that apple. \n\nBut (0,6) to (0,5) etc. But moving straight down would take me to (0,3) eventually. The apple is at (7,3). So perhaps not directly. \n\nAlternatively, moving right could help get to (8,5) or (9,8). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to avoid moving into positions that are blocked. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right is better because it allows me to approach the apple at (8,5) or (9,8). \n\nBut (1,7) is a step towards that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down is safer for the next steps. \n\nBut let's think about future moves. \n\nIf I move down to (0,6), next turn I can continue down towards (0,5), (0,4), etc. But the apple at (7,3) is in a different x position. \n\nIf I move right to (1,7), then next turn I can move right again, or up/down. \n\nBut perhaps the apple at (8,5) is more accessible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving in some direction. \n\nBut since I don't know their next move, I need to choose the safest path. \n\nAnother consideration: after this move, the enemy's possible moves. \n\nIf I move down to (0,6), then next turn, the enemy's head is at (0,7) (if they moved down) or (0,9) if they moved up. \n\nBut I need to avoid collisions. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,7) might take me away from the enemy's possible path. \n\nBut I need to make sure that in the next move, I don't collide. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving right is better. \n\nBut let's think about the apple at (2,3). That's at x=2, y=3. If I move right to (1,7), then maybe not towards that. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,0) is far. \n\nWait, perhaps the closest apple is (7,3) at (7,3). So x=7, y=3. \n\nFrom (0,7), moving down would take me to (0,6), then (0,5), etc. But to reach (7,3), I need to move right as well. \n\nAlternatively, moving right could allow me to approach (7,3) by moving right and down. \n\nBut I need to choose between moving down or right. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, my next move could be right, but if I move right now, I can start moving towards x=7. \n\nBut I need to make sure that moving right is safe. \n\nSo (1,7) is safe. \n\nSo between DOWN and RIGHT. \n\nWhich is better? \n\nIf I move down, I can continue down towards (7,3) eventually. But that's a long way. \n\nIf I move right, I can start moving towards (8,5) or (9,8). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is closer in terms of steps. Let's see: (0,7) to (7,3) is 7 steps right and 4 steps down. That's 11 steps. \n\nAlternatively, (0,7) to (8,5) is 8 steps right and 2 steps down. \n\nOr (9,8) is 9 right and 1 up. \n\nSo maybe (8,5) is closer. \n\nBut moving right now would take me towards that. \n\nBut perhaps the enemy is approaching. \n\nBut since I can't predict their move, maybe moving right is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down is safer. \n\nWait, but the enemy's head is at (0,8). If I move right to (1,7), then next turn, if the enemy moves down, their head is (0,7), which is my previous position. But that's safe. \n\nBut if I move right, then next turn, I can continue moving right. \n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to move right to get closer to the apple at (8,5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (7,3) is more accessible. \n\nBut I need to think about which direction gives more safe moves. \n\nIf I move down to (0,6), next turn I can move right or left, but left would be invalid. \n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,7) allows me to move right again, or up/down. \n\nBut in terms of N\u00e4he to apples, moving right might be better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the enemy's next move could be down. If they move down to (0,7), which is my previous position. But since I'm moving right, my new position is (1,7). So no collision. \n\nBut if I move down to (0,6), then next turn, if enemy moves down to (0,7), then my head is at (0,6). So no collision. \n\nBut perhaps moving right gives more options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving down is better because it's a straight line towards lower y, which could lead to the apple at (7,3). \n\nBut without knowing the enemy's moves, it's hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is RIGHT. \n\nBut let's think again. \n\nIf I move right to (1,7), then next turn, I can continue moving right. \n\nBut if I move down, I can get closer to the apple at (7,3). \n\nBut perhaps the enemy's body is at (0,9), so moving right is safer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right is better. \n\nAnother thing: the last move was DOWN. So moving right now is a new direction. \n\nBut perhaps the best move is RIGHT. \n\nWait, but let me check again. \n\nIf I move right to (1,7), then in the next turn, I can move right again. But if I keep moving right, I might reach (8,5) in 7 more steps. \n\nBut maybe there's a better path. \n\nAlternatively, moving down to (0,6) and then right to (1,6), but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving right is better. \n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN and RIGHT. \n\nWhich one is safer? \n\nMoving right to (1,7) is safe. \n\nMoving down to (0,6) is also safe. \n\nBut which one leads to better future options? \n\nIf I move right, I can approach the apple at (8,5) or (9,8). \n\nIf I move down, I can approach (7,3) or (6,0). \n\nBut (7,3) is closer in terms of steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy's next move could be down, which would take them to (0,7). If I move down to (0,6), then next turn, their head is at (0,7). So if I move right, I can avoid collision. \n\nBut if I move right now, then next turn, if enemy moves down to (0,7), my head is at (1,7), which is safe. \n\nSo both moves seem safe. \n\nBut perhaps moving right is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (8,5) is more worth it. \n\nSo I think the best move is RIGHT. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. \n\nIf I move right to (1,7), then next turn, I can move right again. \n\nBut if I move down, I can move towards (7,3). \n\nBut which apple is closer? \n\nThe apple at (7,3) is 7 units right and 4 units down. \n\nThe apple at (8,5) is 8 right and 2 down. \n\nSo (8,5) is 8+2=10 steps (Manhattan distance) from (0,7). \n\n(7,3) is 7+4=11 steps. \n\nSo (8,5) is closer. \n\nSo moving right could get me closer to (8,5). \n\nTherefore, moving right is better. \n\nSo the answer is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

I need to keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements and avoid getting trapped in corners. The goal is to eat apples efficiently while maintaining mobility and avoiding collisions.

          "rationale": "Okay, let's start analyzing the current game state to decide the next move for my snake (ID 1). \n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and my snake is at (2,6) with no body segments. The enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (3,8) with a body part at (2,8). They have collected 1 apple each. The apples available are at (6,0), (8,5), (9,8), (7,3), (2,3). \n\nMy immediate goal is to collect apples to increase my score. The nearest apple to my current position (2,6) would probably be (2,3) which is two rows down. But looking at the board, the apple at (7,3) is on row 7, which is three rows down from my current position. Wait, y-coordinate increases upwards. So lower y values are towards the bottom. So (2,6) is higher up than (2,3). Moving down from (2,6) would decrease y. So (2,3) is three steps down. \n\nWait, current position is (2,6). The apple at (2,3) is directly below in the same column. That's a potential target. Similarly, the apple at (7,3) is at the same y=3 but x=7. That would require moving right. \n\nLooking at the board representation:\n\nRow 9 (top): all dots except maybe... \nRow 8 has an apple at (8,5) and (9,8). \nRow 7 has dot at (8,5) maybe? Wait, the board is printed with 9 at top. So rows are from 9 (top) down to 0 (bottom). \n\nThe apple at (6,0) is at the bottom left. (2,3) is in the lower middle. (7,3) is same y as 2,3, but x=7. \n\nMy current move options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nLet's check each direction. \n\nCurrent head is (2,6). \n\nMoving UP (y increases) would take me to (2,7). Is that safe? Check if (2,7) is off the board? No, since y ranges from 0-9. Is there any snake's body there? My body is none. Enemy snake's body is at (2,8). So (2,7) is safe. \n\nMoving DOWN (y decreases) to (2,5). Check if that's safe. That cell is empty. \n\nLEFT to (1,6). Safe. \n\nRIGHT to (3,6). Safe. \n\nNow, check for immediate death. The move could kill me if I hit the board edge (no, all moves are within 0-9). Or into my own body (none), enemy's body. Snake #0's body is at (2,8), head at (3,8). So (3,6) is empty. So all directions are possible. \n\nWait, moving LEFT to (1,6) is possible. \n\nNext step is to avoid collisions. Since all four directions are safe, I need to choose the best among them. \n\nThe strategy is to pick apples. The nearest apple is (2,3) two steps down. But I need to reach it safely. Also, considering that the enemy has a body at (2,8), which is above my head. If I move up to (2,7), maybe they might move towards me. But since all snakes move simultaneously, their movement this turn might affect next turns. \n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (2,3) could help collect that apple quickly. However, another apple at (7,3) is also in the same row (y=3). \n\nBut (2,3) is closer. Let me check the distance. From (2,6) to (2,3) is 3 steps down. To (7,3) is 5 steps right and 3 steps down (total 8 steps if moving right then down, but maybe a Manhattan distance of 8). So (2,3) is closer. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,5) next turn, then again down to (2,4), then down to (2,3) to pick the apple. That's three moves. But maybe there's a way to collect apples faster. \n\nBut also need to avoid being trapped. For example, if I head down, after collecting (2,3), maybe future moves could be blocked. \n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, my next move options may vary. Let's think. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,5) now. Then next turn, if I keep moving down, I can reach (2,3) in two more steps. But maybe other apples are safer. \n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (3,6) could take me towards other apples. For example, (8,5) is in the same row as my head's x=3. But that's 5 steps away. \n\nBut maybe there's a better path. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the other apples. (9,8) is near the enemy's head (3,8). If I move towards that, but the enemy snake is there, but their body is at (2,8). So if I go to (9,8) soon, but that might be dangerous. \n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (3,8) with body at (2,8). So they occupy (3,8) and (2,8). If I move towards (9,8), that's a long way. But maybe after collecting some apples, I can plan a path. \n\nBut the immediate goal is to collect apples. Let me check if any apples are near. (2,3) is the closest. \n\nAnother thing: moving down now to (2,5) allows me to approach (2,3) in two moves. But if I go down, then next move I can go down again. However, after that, the apple is collected. \n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,7). From there, maybe I can turn right or left. But not sure. \n\nWait, but the enemy snake is at (3,8). Their head is at (3,8), and their body is at (2,8). So if I move up to (2,7), then next move, maybe the enemy could move down or left. But since they have an apple at (9,8) perhaps. \n\nBut maybe the key is to collect the apple at (2,3) first. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (7,3) might be safer or reachable sooner. Let me see. From (2,6), moving right to (3,6), then down to (3,5), (3,4), etc. until reaching (7,3). That's a longer path. \n\nHmm. The (2,3) apple is the closest. So priority should be to get that. \n\nBut when moving down from (2,6) to (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3). Each step, I need to make sure that those cells are safe. \n\nCheck if any snake's body is in those cells. The enemy's body is at (2,8), which is above. So (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) should be safe. \n\nAssuming that after moving down three times, I can collect (2,3). But I need to make sure that during these moves, I don't collide. \n\nBut each step must be safe. \n\nSo first move DOWN to (2,5) is safe. Then next turn, again DOWN to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,3). \n\nBut the problem is that each turn, I have to choose a direction. So the first step is to move DOWN now. \n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (1,6) to get into a different column. But that might not be helpful. \n\nAnother thing: after collecting an apple, my snake will grow. So once I reach (2,3), I'll have a body segment there. Then in subsequent moves, I need to make sure not to move into that. \n\nBut for now, the immediate plan is to move down towards (2,3). \n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (3,8). If they move towards (2,8) or other positions, perhaps there's a risk of collision. But since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to be cautious. \n\nBut the current move is safe. So the immediate move should be DOWN towards the apple. \n\nAlternatively, is there a better option? For example, moving RIGHT to (3,6) could take me in a direction where other apples are. \n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,3) is in the same row (y=3) but x=7. So moving right from (2,6) would take me towards x=7. However, that's a horizontal movement. \n\nBut moving right might allow me to approach (7,3) in the same y=3 level. However, the distance is 5 steps right and 3 steps down. That's more steps. \n\nThus, the closest apple is (2,3). So moving DOWN now is better. \n\nAnother point: the enemy snake has a body at (2,8), which is directly above my current head. If I move up, I might approach their body. But since they move at the same time, their movement could affect this. \n\nWait, if I move UP to (2,7), then next turn, if I move UP again, I could reach (2,8) where the enemy's body is. That would be a collision. So moving up is risky in the long term. \n\nTherefore, moving UP might not be the best idea unless I can avoid the enemy. \n\nSo, considering all factors, moving DOWN to approach (2,3) seems the best option. \n\nBut wait, the apple at (2,3) is in the same column. So moving down three times would reach it. But each step must be safe. \n\nSo the first step is to move DOWN. \n\nAnother thing: after collecting the apple at (2,3), my snake's body will be there. Then, in future moves, I need to avoid moving into that. \n\nBut for now, the immediate move is safe. \n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\nDOWN",

It's the most direct path to the apple at (2, 3), which is the closest apple to me. This move will help me get ahead in apples while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake. The other moves are safe but don't provide as direct a path to an apple.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue moving down toward the apple at (2, 3). After getting that apple, consider working toward the apple at (7, 3) or (8, 5). I need to keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements and avoid getting trapped in corners. The goal is to eat apples efficiently while maintaining mobility and avoiding collisions. I should avoid the edges of the board when possible to maintain more movement options, but getting apples is the priority.\n\nDOWN",

From (3, 5) to (2, 1) is 5 cells - moving away.\n- Distance to apple at (7, 3): from (2, 5) to (7, 3) is Manhattan distance 7.

From (3, 5) to (8, 5) is Manhattan distance 5 - moving closer.\n- Distance to apple at (6, 0): from (2, 5) to (6, 0) is Manhattan distance 9.

It gets me closer to the apple at (7, 3) and several other apples, while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake. LEFT moves me away from all apples and is not beneficial.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue moving right toward the apple at (7, 3) or (8, 5). After getting that apple, consider working toward the apple at (6, 0). I need to keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements and avoid getting trapped in corners. The goal is to eat apples efficiently while maintaining mobility and avoiding collisions. I should avoid the edges of the board when possible to maintain more movement options, but getting apples is the priority.\n\nRIGHT",
