Keeps tons of flex in follow-ups\u2014 not boxin' myself in, plenty of wiggle for head-ons or chases. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc80\n\n**Long-term plan for my future self:** Let's KEEP PUSHIN' DOWN and EAST towards enemy turf @ (6,2)\u2014eat when SAFE to grow, force him into tight corners around bottom-right apples like (7,2) or (7,8), build score gap for aggressive head-butt collisions.

Enemy skulkin' at (8,8), his twig body drippin' down x=9 (9,8)(9,7)(9,6), and he's HEMMED IN LIKE A RAT TRAPPED IN A PYTHON'S PULSE!! Who's ready to STRANGLE THIS S.O.B. INTO OBLIVION?? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\nLoomin' from our throne at (7,7), body slitherin' (6,7)(6,6)(6,5)\u2014survival's cold and calculatin': UP to (7,8) snatches that sweet APPLE munch for instant 4-APPLE LEAD/GROW TO 5-SEGS (BOOM, 4-3 DOMINATION START!), ZERO DEATH THERE (head grabs empty spot, clears y=8 for upward sweeps, no walls/edges/body bumps), sets vertical push into his territory while duckin' enemy dodges. DOWN to (7,6) drops south safe (7,6) vacant, loops low for west apples like (5,6) eventual feast, widens space if he LEFTs (7,8) instead, but WHERE'S THE FIREPOWER?? Tamers don't triumph! RIGHT to (8,7) charges HIS DOMAIN (8,7) wide-open, lenses NORTH PRESSURE on his head at (8,8) (x-gap now 0 horizontal, NEXT MOVE UP TO (8,8) COULD BE HEAD-ON GLORY IF WE LEAD!), body flexes right/allies with no blockages, prime for east floods or up-turns to y=8 heaven if he dips south. LEFT? FORGET THAT BACKSTEP BULL\u2014HITTING OUR OWN (6,7) BODY IS SELF-SABOTAGE SUPREME, GUARD YOUR SKIN OR PERISH!! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca5 Only UP, DOWN, RIGHT stay BREATHIN', but WE'RE NOT HIDIN'\u2014WE'RE HUNTIN'!\n\nEnemy's shackled choices?

SOUTH SHALLOW, BUT IF WE RIGHT THERE,\u05d4\u05dc COLLISION CATASTROPHE! Watch him skulk LEFT or DOWN, fam\u2014likely LEFT to survive board blunders, so RIGHT to (8,7) flanks sharp, forces his DOWN dodge while we swarm x=8 UNITES, opens UP next (8,8) for apple hunt / HEAD-CRACK CLASH (OUR LEAD LURES DEATH!). UP eats and leads, showin' no fear for collision risk (we lead post-munch or die tryin'!), positions NORTH BULGE to box his x=9 edge, flexes west/radio south if he hides\u2014future up-rights eat (7,8) already, then zigzag y=8-9 camp while goring his column. DOWN's meek play-it-safe, no content this turn, but opens west/apple chases like (5,\n\n\n0) quick grab, avoids risks for long hauls if he toys weak\u2014BUT WEAKLINGS DON'T WIN WARS! RIGHT'S AGGRESSIVE SHAKE, shrinks board for HIS LEAD, sets multi-turn x=8 ambushes (lower him? NECK SNAP NEXT!).\n\nFearless fam\u2014UP SNATCHES LEAD \u0993])/ES, GROW MIGHTY AT 5-SEGS ( eat, no shrink), towers north to x=8 chokes, watch enemy bend (DOWN to (8,7) keeps us alive thera/ safe; LEGACY LEFT bags us dead draw but ends his edge-game too). WILL HE COLLIDE OUR LEAD-UP?? IF NOT, WE OWN Y=8-9 ZONE NEXT YEAR\tUP FOR (7,8) EAT, CRUSH HIS Y8 LANE WITH FOLLOW UPS TO (8,8) IF HE DOWN-DODGES OR (7,9) IF BOARD FREE/SAFE PLACE, OUT-EAT TO 5+ WHILE BLOCKING HIS NORTH ESCAPES\u2014 LET'S GROW BIG, RUSH COLLISIONS \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd OUR SCORE CRUSHES 5-4+, BOX SOUTH IF HE SIDestructESC, SNAP HIS NECK FOR TOTAL BOARD TAKEOVER!! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP  \n(YO EAT THAT APPLE AND LEAD OR DIE! BOOST TO 4, PRESS NORTH! LET'S GOOOO!)  \nUP for the apple kill, encourage growth-kingdom build.
