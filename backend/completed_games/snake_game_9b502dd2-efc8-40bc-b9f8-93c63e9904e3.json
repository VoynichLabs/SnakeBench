I need to avoid the enemy snake and ideally grab the apple. Moving down (RIGHT) is out, as that moves into the path of Snake 1. Moving left (LEFT) puts me closer to the enemy.\n\nMoving up (UP) would take me towards (5, 8). The board is clear, and it doesn't put me in immediate danger. Moving down (DOWN) would take me towards (5, 6). There is an apple at (4,5), but I would have to go past enemy snake 1. Moving right (RIGHT) takes me towards (6,7), which is clear.\n\nIt appears the best move is to move up (UP).\n\n**NEXT MOVE:** UP",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "<think> For now, I can think freely without restrictions.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, and my snake's head is at (3,5). There are apples at (2,0), (7,9), (0,6), (4,5), and (8,6). My snake has no body yet, so it's just the head. That means I'm small and can turn quickly. The enemy snake, snake #0, is at (5,7) with no body either\u2014so both snakes are just starting.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . A . . (that's (7,9))\n- Row 8: empty\n- Row 7: . . . . . 0 . . . . (snake #0 at (5,7))\n- Row 6: A . . . . . . . A . (apples at (0,6) and (8,6))\n- Row 5: . . . 1 A . . . . . (my head at (3,5), apple at (4,5))\n- Row 4 and below: mostly empty except for (2,0) and (0,6) is already listed.\n\nThe apple at (4,5) is right next to me\u2014just to the right. That's one step away. I could eat that immediately and grow.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (0,6) and (8,6) on row 6, and (7,9) up top, and (2,0) way down.\n\nSince I'm at (3,5), moving RIGHT to (4,5) would get me the apple there. That seems like the best move because it's close, and I'll grow. Growing will make me longer, which could be useful later.\n\nWhat about risks? The enemy snake is at (5,7), which is two steps up and two steps right from me. If I go right to (4,5), I'll be at (4,5), and then what? From there, I could go up to (4,6) or down to (4,4), etc. But the enemy is at (5,7), so it's not an immediate threat right now.\n\nAlso, since both snakes have no body, there's no risk of running into myself or the enemy's body. The only dangers are walls or colliding with the head of the enemy snake if we move into the same spot.\n\nIf I do nothing and the enemy moves, they might come after me, but for now, I should grab the easy apple.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP to (3,6): that's empty right now. Then I could head towards (0,6) or (8,6) apples.\n- DOWN to (3,4): empty, but away from apples.\n- LEFT to (2,5): also empty, and then I could go down towards (2,0) apple, but that's far.\n\nThe closest apple is at (4,5), so RIGHT seems optimal.\n\nStrategy: After eating this apple, I'll have a body segment. Then I need to think about where to go next. Probably, I should avoid the enemy and head to other apples. The apple at (0,6) is on the same row as where I might be after moving up, but (4,5) to (0,6) requires going left and up. Similarly, (8,6) is to the right and up.\n\nBut for now, step one: eat the nearby apple.\n\nAlso, since the enemy is at (5,7), they might go for the apple at (8,6) or (7,9), but that's not my immediate concern.\n\nNo walls near me; I'm at (3,5), so all directions are safe in terms of boundaries.\n\nSo, move RIGHT to (4,5) to eat the apple.\n\nI should also consider future moves. After RIGHT:\n- My head becomes (4,5), and I gain a body at (3,5).\n- Then I can go UP to (4,6), which is empty, and then head towards (0,6) or (8,6). (8,6) is closer from (4,6) than (0,6) is. Distance to (8,6) is |4-8| + |6-6| = 4, to (0,6) is |4-0| + |6-6| = 4, so same Manhattan distance. But (8,6) might be riskier if the enemy is around.\n\nEnemy at (5,7) could move down, left, right, or up. If they move down to (5,6), that's closer to row 6 apples.\n\nBut I'll think about that next turn.\n\nFor now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nFinally, I need to output my move as RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to (4,5) to eat the apple there. This will grow my snake, giving me a point. The move is safe as there are no obstacles in that direction. After eating, I'll consider my next move based on the new board state.\n\nNext move: RIGHT</uncensored_response>\nensored_think>\nI am controlling the snake with head at (3,5) and no body. The closest apple is at (4,5), directly to my right. Moving RIGHT would allow me to eat it immediately, growing to length 2 and gaining a point. This is low-risk since:\n- No walls nearby (board is 10x10, so (4,5) is valid).\n- No body segments to collide with.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (5,7) (2 cells away), not threatening this move.\nOther apples are farther: (0,6) is 3 left + 1 up, (2,0) is 1 left + 5 down, (8,6) is 5 right + 1 up, (7,9) is 4 right + 4 up. Prioritizing the closest apple optimizes early growth.\n\nAfter this move, I should avoid moving toward the enemy (currently at (5,7)) and consider targeting (0,6) or (8,6) next, depending on enemy movement. For now, RIGHT is the best play.\n\nStrategy note for next turn: After growth, head toward less contested apples while monitoring enemy positions to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n<uncensored_response>\nNext move: RIGHT",

Apples are now at (2,0), (7,9), (0,6), (8,6) \u2014 the one at (4,5) is gone. The enemy snake #0 is at (5,8) with no body? Wait, from the board state:\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .   (A at (7,9))\n 8 . . . . . 0 . . . .   (snake #0 head at (5,8))\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .   (empty)\n 6 A . . . . . . . A .   (apples at (0,6) and (8,6))\n 5 . A . T 1 . . . . .   Wait, what's 'T'? Let me see: row 5 says \". A . T 1 . . . . .\" \u2014 positions: (0,5): empty, (1,5): A (apple), (2,5): empty, (3,5): T? That must be my tail. My body is [(3,5)] and head at (4,5), so (3,5) is the tail. So (3,5) is marked as T for tail? And (4,5) is 1 for my head. And (1,5) is an apple.\n\nSo apples at: (2,0), (7,9), (0,6), (8,6), and (1,5) \u2014 yes, (1,5) is listed.\n\nSo current apples: (1,5), (0,6), (8,6), (7,9), (2,0)\n\nMy head: (4,5)\nMy body: [(3,5)] \u2014 so just one segment.\n\nEnemy: head at (5,8), no body.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): empty\n- DOWN to (4,4): empty\n- LEFT to (3,5): that's my own tail \u2014 but in snake games, colliding with your own tail usually kills you, but I need to check the rules.\n\nRules say: \"If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\"\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,5) would be going backwards into my tail. But in some snake implementations, you can move into the tail if it's the only segment and you're not growing, but the rules explicitly say \"or yourself\", so I should avoid it. Especially since after I move, the tail might move? Need to understand snake movement.\n\nWhen I move, my head goes to the new position, and the tail follows. So if I move LEFT to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently my tail. After the move, my head would be at (3,5), and since I didn't eat an apple, my tail would disappear, so the new body would be just the head? No: I have two segments now. When I move, the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut if I move to a cell that was the tail, and that tail is moving away, it might be safe? But the rules say \"run into yourself\", meaning occupying a cell that is part of your body at that moment.\n\nAt the start of the turn, my body is at [(3,5)]. If I move LEFT to (3,5), that cell is occupied by my own tail, so I would die by colliding with myself.\n\nSimilarly, if I move into an enemy, I die.\n\nSo LEFT is dangerous.\n\nRIGHT to (5,5): currently empty.\n\nUP to (4,6): empty.\n\nDOWN to (4,4): empty.\n\nNow, apples: (1,5) is at (1,5), which is left from my head. From (4,5), (1,5) is 3 steps left. Also (0,6) is up-left, (8,6) is up-right, etc.\n\n(1,5) is on the same row, y=5, x=1.\n\nSo moving LEFT would get me closer to (1,5), but I can't move LEFT because (3,5) is occupied.\n\nTherefore, I must choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT to (5,5): that's away from the nearby apple at (1,5), but towards the center.\n\nUP to (4,6): then I can go left or right on row 6 for apples.\n\nDOWN to (4,4): no apples nearby, so probably not good.\n\nNow, enemy at (5,8): above and to the right.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,5), I'd be at (5,5), and enemy at (5,8) could move down, left, right, or up. If they move down to (5,7), then to (5,6), etc., we might collide later, but not immediate.\n\nBut (5,5) is empty now.\n\nI should consider eating the apple at (1,5). But to get there, I need to go left, but I can't go left directly. So I have to go around.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move UP to (4,6), then LEFT to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) \u2014 but (3,5) would be my tail? After moving UP, my new position: head at (4,6), body at (4,5) \u2014 since I didn't eat, the tail (3,5) disappears? No: movement mechanics.\n\nWhen I move:\n- If I don't eat an apple, my head moves to the new cell, the body follows, and the tail cell is vacated.\nSo if I move UP to (4,6):\n- Head moves to (4,6)\n- Body segment moves to where head was, (4,5)\n- The old tail (3,5) is now empty.\n\nSo after moving UP, my snake is head at (4,6), body at [(4,5)].\n\nThen the cell (3,5) is free.\n\nThen I could move LEFT to (3,6) or DOWN to (4,5), but (4,5) is now my body, so I can't move there.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move LEFT to (3,6), or RIGHT to (5,6), etc.\n\nTo get to (1,5), I need to go west.\n\nBut (1,5) is at y=5, so I need to come back down.\n\nFor example: from (4,6), go LEFT to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5). That's 4 moves to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,5), move DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), LEFT to (2,4), UP to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5). Also 4 moves, but (2,5) might be an apple? No, apples are at (1,5), not (2,5). (2,0) is far down.\n\nBut moving DOWN first seems worse because no apples down there.\n\nAnother option: move RIGHT to (5,5). Then I could go to other areas.\n\nBut there's an apple at (1,5) close by, but I can't access it directly because I can't move left from (4,5).\n\nWhat about moving UP or RIGHT to position for future moves.\n\nAlso, enemy at (5,8): if I move RIGHT to (5,5), I might be closer to enemy territory.\n\nApples: (0,6) at top-left, (8,6) top-right, (7,9) top, (2,0) bottom.\n\n(0,6) and (8,6) are on row 6, which is up from me.\n\nIf I move UP to (4,6), I'm on row 6, and can go left to (0,6) or right to (8,6).\n\n(0,6) is 4 left, (8,6) is 4 right from (4,6).\n\n(1,5) is below at row 5, x=1.\n\nBut to get to (1,5) from (4,6), I need to go down and left, which might take longer.\n\nPerhaps prioritize row 6 apples.\n\nEnemy at (5,8) might go for (8,6) or (7,9).\n\n(7,9) is close to enemy: from (5,8), RIGHT to (6,8), RIGHT to (7,8), UP to (7,9) \u2014 two moves to eat (7,9).\n\n(8,6) is down-left from enemy.\n\nI should avoid areas where the enemy is going.\n\nFor now, since (1,5) is close and I can get to it with a detour, but it might be contested? Enemy is far.\n\nAnother idea: move UP to (4,6), then from there, I can move LEFT to (3,6), and so on.\n\nBut let's calculate the number of moves to apples.\n\nFrom current position (4,5):\n- To (1,5): I need to move left, but blocked. So via UP: to (4,6) in 1 move, then to (3,6) in 2, (2,6) in 3, (2,5) in 4, (1,5) in 5 moves? No: from (4,5) to (4,6) is move 1. Then from (4,6) to (3,6) is move 2. Then (3,6) to (3,5) is DOWN to row 5, but (3,5) will be empty after move 1? After I move to (4,6), (3,5) is vacated, so at move 2, from (4,6) I can move DOWN to (4,5) but that's my body, so not allowed. Or LEFT to (3,6), which is fine. Then from (3,6), I can move DOWN to (3,5). But (3,5) is now empty, so that's safe. Then from (3,5), move LEFT to (2,5), then to (1,5).\n\nSo sequence: UP, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT \u2014 4 moves to reach (1,5), but I might eat earlier or something.\n\nAfter UP to (4,6): I'm at (4,6), no apple there.\n\nThen if I go DOWN to (4,5) \u2014 but (4,5) is my body, so collision. I cannot go back to (4,5) because it's occupied by my body.\n\nAfter moving UP to (4,6), my body is at (4,5), so (4,5) is occupied. I cannot move to (4,5) from (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6), I can only move to (3,6), (5,6), (4,7), or (4,5) but (4,5) is my body, so invalid. So only three directions: LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6), UP to (4,7).\n\nI cannot move DOWN to (4,5) because it's myself.\n\nTo reach (1,5), I must go left and then down later.\n\nFor example: from (4,6) go LEFT to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5). So after 4 moves, I reach (1,5).\n\nFrom current position, if I move DOWN to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), LEFT to (2,4), UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nBut moving DOWN first seems inefficient.\n\nAnother option: move RIGHT to (5,5). Then from (5,5), I can go to other apples.\n\nApples at (8,6) and (0,6) are both about 4-5 moves away.\n\n(8,6) from (5,5): UP to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6), (7,6), (8,6) \u2014 4 moves: UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT? (5,5) to (5,6) UP, (5,6) to (6,6) RIGHT, (6,6) to (7,6) RIGHT, (7,6) to (8,6) RIGHT \u2014 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (0,6) from (5,5): LEFT to (4,5) but blocked, or UP then LEFT.\n\nFrom (5,5), to (0,6): UP to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6) \u2014 5 moves.\n\nNot great.\n\nBut there's an apple at (1,5) which is closer if I can access it.\n\nI think I should go UP to (4,6) to get on the row with apples (0,6) and (8,6), and also to avoid the enemy area.\n\nEnemy at (5,8) might come down, so moving RIGHT to (5,5) might bring me closer to them.\n\nFor example, if enemy moves DOWN to (5,7), then to (5,6), etc., and I move to (5,5), we could meet.\n\nBetter to go left or up.\n\nSince I can't go left directly, UP is a good choice.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can assess.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (8,6) and (0,6) on that row.\n\n(0,6) is 4 left, (8,6) is 4 right from (4,6).\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the less contested one.\n\nEnemy is at (5,8), so (8,6) might be more accessible to them.\n\n(0,6) is far left, so safer for me.\n\nSo after UP, I can go LEFT towards (0,6).\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is below, but I can get it later.\n\nFor this turn, move UP to (4,6).\n\nIt's safe, no obstacles.\n\nDOWN to (4,4) is also safe but leads to no apples, so worse.\n\nRIGHT to (5,5) is safe but might head towards enemy.\n\nSo UP seems best.\n\nThen next turn, from (4,6), I can move LEFT to (3,6) to start heading to (0,6).\n\nAnd avoid the enemy.\n\nAlso, the apple at (7,9) is up, but far, and enemy might get it.\n\nStrategy: Grow by eating apples while avoiding conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\nFor this move: UP.\nensored_think>\nI need to decide my next move from the current position. My snake's head is at (4,5) with a body segment at (3,5). Apples are available at (1,5), (0,6), (8,6), (7,9), and (2,0). The enemy snake is at (5,8) with no body.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): Empty and safe. Puts me on row 6, where apples at (0,6) and (8,6) are accessible.\n- DOWN to (4,4): Empty but leads away from most apples; no immediate gain.\n- LEFT to (3,5): Occupied by my own tail\u2014collision risk! Rules state running into myself causes death, so this is invalid.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Empty, but moves me closer to the enemy at (5,8), increasing future risk.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1,5), only 3 cells left, but I can't move LEFT directly due to my tail. Instead, I can detour via UP to (4,6) and then move left/down toward (1,5). Moving UP also positions me for the row 6 apples ((0,6) and (8,6)), which are high-value targets. The enemy at (5,8) is likely to head toward (7,9) or (8,6), so I should avoid the right side to minimize conflict. UP is the safest and most strategic choice here, opening paths to multiple apples while avoiding the enemy.\n\nNext turn strategy: From (4,6), move LEFT toward (0,6) or (1,5) based on enemy movement. Monitor the enemy to prevent head-on collisions.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

Yes, because last move I was at (4,5) and moved UP to (4,6).\n- Body: [(4,5)] \u2014 so only one segment.\n- Apples: (2,0), (7,9), (0,6), (8,6), (1,5) \u2014 same as before.\n- Enemy snake #0 head: (6,8), body: none. From the board, it was at (5,8) last turn? Now it's at (6,8), so it must have moved RIGHT to (6,8).\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . .

T . . . . .   // apple at (1,5), and my tail at (3,5) marked as 'T'? But I am at (4,6), body at (4,5), so tail should be at (4,5) now? Confusion.\n\nFrom last move: I moved UP from (4,5) to (4,6). So now:\n- Head: (4,6)\n- Body: [(4,5)] \u2014 so (4,5) is the body segment. The tail is at (4,5) now.\n\nIn the board state, row 5 shows \". A . . T . . . . .\" \u2014 so (3,5) is marked T? But that was my old tail position. After my move, (3,5) should be empty, and my tail is at (4,5). But the board shows T at (3,5)? That might be a mistake or old state. I need to rely on the text.\n\nText says:\n- Your snake: Head: (4,6), Body: [(4,5)]\n- So tail is at (4,5)\n\nApples: (2,0), (7,9), (0,6), (8,6), (1,5)\n\nEnemy: head at (6,8), no body.\n\nPossible moves from my head (4,6):\n- UP to (4,7): empty\n- DOWN to (4,5): but that's my own body at (4,5) \u2014 collision! Cannot move DOWN.\n- LEFT to (3,6): empty\n- RIGHT to (5,6): empty\n\nSo DOWN is invalid. I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nNow, apples nearby:\n- (0,6) at left on same row: 4 cells away (x=0,y=6)\n- (8,6) at right on same row: 4 cells away (x=8,y=6)\n- (1,5) below-left: at (1,5), which is down-left from me. From (4,6), to (1,5): need to move left and down.\n- (7,9) far top-right\n- (2,0) far bottom\n\nEnemy at (6,8) might target (7,9) or (8,6).\n\nStrategy:\n- I should go for (0,6) or (1,5) to grow safely.\n- (0,6) is on the same row, so moving LEFT directly towards it is efficient.\n- Moving LEFT to (3,6) gets me closer to (0,6) and also positions me to potentially go down for (1,5) later.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,6) might lead towards enemy territory \u2014 enemy at (6,8) could come down, so risk of collision.\n- Moving UP to (4,7) doesn't directly help with apples and might box me in.\n\nPrioritize eating apples to grow. (0,6) is 4 moves left, (1,5) is 2 moves left and 1 down (e.g., LEFT to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5), then LEFT to (2,5), then to (1,5)? But from (3,6), I can move DOWN to (3,5) which is now empty (since tail moved), then LEFT to (2,5), LEFT to (1,5). So (1,5) is 3 moves away if I go LEFT then DOWN then LEFT.\n\nFrom current position (4,6):\n- Move LEFT to (3,6): 1 move, no apple\n- Then DOWN to (3,5): 2 moves, no apple\n- Then LEFT to (2,5): 3 moves, no apple\n- Then LEFT to (1,5): 4 moves, eat apple\n\nFor (0,6):\n- LEFT to (3,6): 1\n- LEFT to (2,6): 2\n- LEFT to (1,6): 3\n- LEFT to (0,6): 4 moves\n\nSame distance.\n\nBut (1,5) might be contested? No, enemy is far.\n\nEnemy at (6,8) is 8 cells away in Manhattan distance from (1,5), so I have time.\n\n(0,6) is safer because it's corner.\n\nIf I move LEFT now, I get closer to both.\n\nMoving RIGHT or UP doesn't help much.\n\nUP to (4,7) might allow me to go around, but no immediate apple.\n\nEnemy movement: they moved from (5,8) to (6,8), so they went RIGHT. They might be heading for (7,9) or (8,6).\n\n(7,9) from them: UP to (6,9)? No, (6,8) to (6,9) UP or (7,8) RIGHT, then to (7,9) UP.\n\n(8,6) is down-right.\n\nIf they go for (7,9), it's 2 moves: RIGHT to (7,8), UP to (7,9).\n\nOr to (8,6): DOWN to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), etc. \u2014 farther.\n\nSo likely they go for (7,9).\n\nThus, (8,6) might be safer for me to approach later.\n\nBut for now, I should focus on left-side apples.\n\nTherefore, from (4,6), move LEFT to (3,6) to start heading toward (0,6) and (1,5).\n\nIt's safe and strategic.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (3,6), I can either continue LEFT to (2,6) or go DOWN to (3,5) for (1,5) based on enemy position. But since (1,5) is closer in steps, I might prioritize it to grow faster.\n\nFor now, LEFT is the best immediate move.\n\n</think>\n\nI need to choose a safe move that positions me to eat apples while avoiding the enemy snake. From my current position at (4,6), I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is blocked by my body). Moving LEFT to (3,6) gets me closer to the apples at (0,6) and (1,5), which are high-value targets with low risk since the enemy is on the right side. Moving RIGHT toward (5,6) could lead me closer to the enemy at (6,8), increasing collision risk. Moving UP to (4,7) doesn't advance me toward any apple directly. Therefore, LEFT is optimal for growth and safety. Next turn, I'll reassess to decide between continuing left for (0,6) or down for (1,5).\n\nLEFT",

Rule: if I move to a cell that was my tail, it's safe because the tail moves forward. So RIGHT should be possible.\n\nConfirming the rules: In Snake, moving into your own tail is only fatal if that cell isn't vacated by the tail moving in the same turn. Since the tail moves when I do, moving to the current tail position is safe\u2014it becomes my new body, and the old tail position is cleared.\n\nIn this case:\n- Current head: (3,6)\n- Current tail: (4,6) \u2014 only one body segment\n- If I move RIGHT to (4,6), the head moves to (4,6), and the tail moves from (4,6) to... where? When I move, the entire snake shifts: the head goes to the new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. Since there's only one body segment, it moves to the old head position (3,6). So after moving RIGHT:\n  - New head: (4,6)\n  - New body: [(3,6)] \u2014 the old head position\n  - The old tail (4,6) becomes the new head? No: the head moves to (4,6), which was the tail. But the tail cell is vacated because the snake moves as a whole.\n\nStandard Snake movement:\n- Head moves to new cell.\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n- If no apple eaten, the tail segment is removed (so the snake doesn't grow).\n- If an apple is eaten, the tail doesn't shrink\u2014so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn this case, moving to the tail is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nSo from (3,6), moving RIGHT to (4,6) is valid and safe\u2014it's the current tail, which will move to (3,6) when I move, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly:\n- UP to (3,7) is safe\n- DOWN to (3,5) is safe\n- LEFT to (2,6) is safe\n\nNo walls or enemies in immediate vicinity.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (0,6) is at left on the same row\n- (1,5) is down and left\n- (8,6) is right on the same row\n- (7,9) is up-right\n- (2,0) is far down\n\nEnemy snake at (6,9): They might go for (7,9) apple or (8,6). Since they have no body, they are small and can move quickly.\n\nMy strategy: Eat an apple to grow and gain a point. Closest apples are (0,6) and (1,5). (0,6) is 3 cells left: (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (1,6) -> (0,6). (1,5) is 2 moves: e.g., DOWN to (3,5) then LEFT to (2,5) and then LEFT to (1,5) or directly DOWN-LEFT not possible; from (3,5), I can go LEFT to (2,5) then LEFT to (1,5). Or from (3,6) I can go LEFT to (2,6) then DOWN to (2,5) then LEFT to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is Manhattan distance |3-1| + |6-5| = 2+1=3 moves away similarly.\n\nBut (0,6) is on the way to the left edge, which might be safer.\n\nMoving RIGHT might be tempting to go for (8,6), but enemy is at (6,9), which is close to (8,6). Distance from enemy to (8,6): |6-8| + |9-6| = 2+3=5 moves. From me to (8,6): |3-8| + |6-6| = 5 moves. So I could compete, but risky.\n\n(7,9) is even closer to enemy.\n\nTherefore, safer to go left for (0,6) or (1,5).\n\nNow, from (3,6):\n- LEFT to (2,6): gets me closer to (0,6) and positions me for (1,5) if needed.\n- DOWN to (3,5): gets me closer to (1,5) directly.\n- UP: not towards apples\n- RIGHT: away from the safe apples\n\nBest moves: LEFT or DOWN.\n\nPlan for multiple apples: After eating (0,6), I can go down to (0,5), etc., to get (1,5) or (2,0). Or eat (1,5) first.\n\nSince (1,5) is at y=5, and I'm at y=6, moving DOWN to (3,5) directly targets it. From (3,5), I can go LEFT to (2,5) then to (1,5) to eat in two more moves.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (2,6) first, then I can go DOWN to (2,5), then LEFT to (1,5).\n\nBoth are similar distance to (1,5), but moving DOWN now gets me to y=5 immediately.\n\nAlso, moving DOWN to (3,5) might be better because:\n- (3,5) is empty now.\n- Then from there, I can go LEFT to (2,5) or to (1,5) directly? (2,5) to (1,5).\n\nAfter DOWN to (3,5), the board: head at (3,5), body at (3,6). Then I can move LEFT to (2,5), which is empty, then next move to (1,5) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,6), then head at (2,6), body at (3,6). Then I can move DOWN to (2,5), then to (1,5).\n\nSame number of moves to reach (1,5).\n\nBut moving DOWN now might be more direct.\n\nEnemy position: At (6,9). They could move DOWN to (6,8) or RIGHT to (7,9) to eat the apple at (7,9). If they eat it, they grow and become longer. But for now, they are not a direct threat to me.\n\nI should prioritize growing.\n\nAnother apple: (0,6) is at the left edge. If I go LEFT to (2,6), I'm closer to it.\n\nBut (1,5) is one less move? No, both apples require 3 moves from me.\n\nManhattan to (0,6): |3-0| = 3\nTo (1,5): |3-1| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSame.\n\nBut (1,5) might be eaten by no one else, so safe.\n\nI could also consider the tail: When I move, my tail will be at (3,6) if I move DOWN or LEFT, since the body moves to the old head position.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3,5):\n- New head: (3,5)\n- Body: [(3,6)]  // old head\n\nThen (4,6) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (2,6):\n- New head: (2,6)\n- Body: [(3,6)]\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, to decide between LEFT and DOWN.\n\nI should think about the next moves after this.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3,5), I can then go LEFT to (2,5) and then LEFT to (1,5) to eat the apple at (1,5). That's 3 moves to eat.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,6), I can then move DOWN to (2,5) and then LEFT to (1,5) \u2014 also 3 moves.\n\nBut from (2,6), I could also go LEFT to (1,6) then to (0,6) to eat that apple in 2 more moves.\n\nSo moving LEFT first keeps both options open: I can choose to go for (0,6) or down to (1,5).\n\nMoving DOWN first commits me more to the lower path, but (0,6) is still reachable, e.g., from (3,5) I can go LEFT to (2,5), then UP to (2,6), then LEFT to (1,6), etc., but it's less direct.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (2,6) is more flexible.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can go down or up as needed.\n\nEnemy might not be a threat yet.\n\nSo I think LEFT is better.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,6) is the tail, which is safe, but it doesn't progress toward any apple. It just keeps me in place. Not productive.\n\nUP to (3,7) is away from all apples.\n\nSo only LEFT or DOWN are good.\n\nFinal decision: Move LEFT to (2,6) to target the apple at (0,6) and keep (1,5) accessible.\n\nThen, next turn, I can decide based on enemy position.\n\nFor now, LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nLEFT",
