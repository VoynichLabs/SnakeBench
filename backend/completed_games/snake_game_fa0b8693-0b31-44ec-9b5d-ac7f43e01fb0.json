However, from (3,1) you\u2019d have very limited options because the only free move would be to go left\u2014(3,1)\u2019s other neighbors (right, up) are blocked by your own body (remember (3,2) and (4,1) lead toward congested territory), and going back down returns to (3,0). This route would keep you close to your own body, which may make the upcoming navigation toward any remaining apple (all of which are much further up) even harder.\n\n\u2022 LEFT to (2,0): That cell is empty and moves you away from the tight cluster of your body (your body occupies cells mainly starting at (3,0) and going right/up). Moving left gives you an extra degree of freedom: from (2,0) you\u2019ll have options to either go up or further left. In subsequent moves you can then work around your body (using cells like (1,0) then (1,1) or (2,1)) to eventually clear a path for heading toward one of the remaining apples\u2014especially the apple at (4,3), which is the closest by Manhattan distance (4 away from your current head if a detour is found).\n\n\u2022 RIGHT would lead you to (4,0), a cell already filled by your own body.\n\u2022 DOWN is off the board.\n\nThus, although both UP and LEFT are safe at first glance, UP seems to funnel you into a dead\u2010end against your own body (since from (3,1) the only non\u2013backtracking move is to go LEFT anyway, and that forces your head closer to the congested area). In contrast, moving LEFT to (2,0) immediately gives you more lateral space and more maneuvering options for the coming turns.\n\nTherefore, the best move now is: LEFT.\n\nNext-turn strategy for yourself:\n\u2003\u2013 From (2,0), plan to keep expanding into open space\u2014for example, you might later go LEFT to (1,0) if needed or head UP to get closer to the apple zones.\n\u2003\u2013 Work to avoid the tight choke point created by your body along row 2.\n\u2003\u2013 Once the board starts to clear (when you no longer grow on every move, your tail will eventually vacate a cell), try mapping a path toward the nearest remaining apple (likely the one at (4,3)) while carefully avoiding self-collision and the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Notice that one apple (3,4) is now a prime target\u2014it lies just one up and one left of our head (diagonally).

From there, we could later move left to (3,4).\n\u2003\u2013 LEFT to (3,3): Also free, and then moving UP next would put us right onto (3,4).\n\u2003\u2013 RIGHT to (5,3): That would position us to head toward the apple at (6,3) in two moves.\n\n\u2022 Our own body occupies cells (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0) and (3,0).

The enemy snake (Snake #0) is currently higher up (with its head at (5,5) and body extending toward row 7), so no immediate threat is coming from that direction.\n\nBoth the apple (3,4) via a LEFT-then-UP route and the apple (6,3) via a RIGHT-then-RIGHT route are equally reachable (each will take two moves). Considering that (3,4) is only a single vertical unit above (3,3) (and then becomes adjacent to the apple) and might be less contested, a move to the left seems a prudent choice.\n\nThus, by moving LEFT from (4,3) to (3,3), we set ourselves up to quickly reach the apple (3,4) on our next move.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

Now I need to assess my options for the next move.\n\nLet me check what's available in each direction:\n- UP: Would take me to (6, 4) - but that's where my body segment is now, so I'd die\n- DOWN: Would take me to (6, 2) - this is open space and safe\n- LEFT: Would take me to (5, 3) - this is open space and safe  \n- RIGHT: Would take me to (7, 3) - this is open space and safe\n\nNow let me look at the remaining apples and plan my strategy:\n- (7, 6) - northeast, several moves away\n- (9, 2) - southeast, about 4 moves away\n- (0, 3) - directly west, 6 moves away but on the same row\n- (0, 2) - southwest, about 7 moves away\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (2, 4) and seems to be in the western part of the board. If I go after the apple at (0, 3), I might encounter it. The safer option might be to head toward the apple at (9, 2) in the southeast.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I'll be moving toward the apple at (9, 2) while staying away from the enemy snake. This seems like the most strategic move.\n\nGoing DOWN to (6, 2) would also position me well to eventually reach (9, 2), and it gives me more maneuvering room.\n\nI think RIGHT is the better choice as it makes more direct progress toward the (9, 2) apple while keeping me safe from collisions.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward the apple at (9, 2) - likely DOWN and then RIGHT again. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position and avoid the western side of the board where it's operating.\n\nRIGHT"

My plan from last turn is working out exactly as intended. I can move DOWN to (9, 2) and collect the apple, which will give me a point and make my snake grow longer.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll be at the bottom-right corner area at (9, 2). From there, I'll need to plan my next target. Looking at the remaining apples:\n- (7, 6): This looks like a good next target, relatively close and in open space\n- (6, 7): Also nearby \n- (0, 2): Too close to enemy snake #1\n- (5, 0): On the bottom edge\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is still positioned in the western part of the board at (0, 3), so I'm maintaining good distance by staying in the east.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (9, 2), I'll need to move either LEFT or UP since I'll be near the corner. I should head toward the apple at (7, 6) or (6, 7) as my next target, probably going LEFT first to get away from the edge.\n\nDOWN"

Moving UP to (6, 3) keeps me on the direct vertical path toward the apple at (6, 7) and (6, 8).

Checking the board, (1,1) is free. (The only adjacent non\u2010safe squares are (1,2) which is occupied and going DOWN is off the board.) \n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 leads to (0,0), which is open. \n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (2,0) is part of our body.\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (1,\u20131) is off the board.\n\nSo our only immediate safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\nWhich one should we choose? Remember the apples are at (7,6), (6,7), (0,9), (9,9), and (6,8). The apple at (0,9) is in the top\u2010left corner, so heading toward column 0 eventually is desirable. \n\nIf we choose LEFT right away, our head will be at (0,0), already on column 0. Although being in a corner isn\u2019t ideal long term, it gives us a direct vertical corridor toward the (0,9) apple. (Keep in mind that since our snake isn\u2019t growing unless we eat an apple, our tail will move and eventually free up parts of our body that might otherwise block our upward progress.)\n\nAlternatively, moving UP would bring us to (1,1), but then our only follow-up (since (1,2) and (2,1) are occupied) would be to move LEFT to (0,1), which is effectively similar to what we\u2019d achieve by moving LEFT immediately.\n\nBoth moves are safe, but moving LEFT now is more direct for heading into column 0. It helps us plan a route upward toward the (0,9) apple while staying clear of our body and the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy note for future turns:\n\u2003\u2013 As the tail shifts, keep track of freed spaces so that our upward corridor isn\u2019t blocked.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor enemy movements and any potential traps our own body might create in the corner.\n\u2003\u2013 When more than one safe move exists, try to steer toward an apple if it doesn\u2019t risk our survival.\n\nThus, my decided move is: LEFT."

Additionally, starting our vertical climb toward the (0,9) apple from column 0 seems more straightforward.\n\n4. We also keep in mind that our body moves as we go.
