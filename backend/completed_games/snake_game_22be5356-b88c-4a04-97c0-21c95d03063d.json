            "rationale": "# Analyzing the Current Game State\n\n**Current Position:** (6, 6) with body at [(6, 7)]\n**Board Size:** 10x10\n**Available Apples:** (0, 4), (6, 5), (3, 5), (1, 4), (3, 0)\n**Enemy Snake Position:** (9, 2) with body at [(8, 2)]\n\n## Analyzing My Possible Moves:\n- LEFT: Moving to (5, 6) - Safe move, no obstacles\n- RIGHT: Moving to (7, 6) - Safe move, no obstacles\n- UP: Moving to (6, 7) - This would hit my own body, so this is not valid\n- DOWN: Moving to (6, 5) - Safe move and would collect an apple!\n\n## Apple Proximity Analysis:\nFrom my current position (6, 6), distances to each apple:\n- Apple at (0, 4): 8 steps away (6 left, 2 down)\n- Apple at (6, 5): 1 step away (directly below me)\n- Apple at (3, 5): 4 steps away (3 left, 1 down)\n- Apple at (1, 4): 7 steps away (5 left, 2 down)\n- Apple at (3, 0): 9 steps away (3 left, 6 down)\n\n## Strategic Decision:\nThere's an apple directly below me at (6, 5), so moving DOWN is the obvious choice. This will allow me to collect an apple immediately, grow my snake, and earn a point.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away in the bottom right corner, so it doesn't pose any immediate threat.\n\n## Next Turn Strategy:\nAfter moving DOWN and collecting the apple at (6, 5), my snake will grow, so I'll have a head at (6, 5) and body at [(6, 6), (6, 7)]. I should then consider moving LEFT toward the apple at (3, 5), as it would be the next closest apple.\n\nDOWN"
