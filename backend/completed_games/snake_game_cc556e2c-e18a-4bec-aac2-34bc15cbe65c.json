Safely claiming a cluster of three relatively uncontested apples in the upper-left is your best route to closing the gap while keeping plenty of escape space and minimizing entanglement with the enemy\u2019s coil.\n\n3) Short plan for future self\n\n- From (4,4), prioritize moving up along column x=4 to take the apple at (4,7) quickly.\n- After (4,7), continue sweeping left/up toward (2,8) and (0,7); enemy\u2019s current shape makes it very hard for them to contest those without a long detour.\n- Keep a wide buffer from the enemy\u2019s lower-left mass; avoid dropping below y\u22484 unless you see a clear, safe tactical gain.\n- Let your top-right tail retract as you shift left, opening more central space for future maneuvers.\n\nLEFT",

That sequence is safe now (no nearby enemy head can contest the apple), but it leaves me in a very narrow corridor with only one safe follow-up move.\n- RIGHT -> (7,1) is empty and legal, and keeps multiple escape options (UP, RIGHT, or DOWN to take the apple next turn). It's also safely out of range of the enemy head.\n\nChoice reasoning:\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT allow me to reach the apple at (7,0) next turn, but RIGHT preserves more immediate mobility and avoids forcing a single-path move that could be exploited later. No enemy head threatens those target cells this turn, so favor maintaining options.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move RIGHT now to (7,1).\n- Next turn, likely go DOWN to eat the (7,0) apple, then pivot back into open space (UP/RIGHT) to avoid getting boxed by my long left-side body. Watch snake #0's moves around (4,4) in case it shifts toward central apples.\n\nRIGHT",
