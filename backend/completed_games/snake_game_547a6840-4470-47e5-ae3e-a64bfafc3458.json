UP to (5,7):\n   - Moves toward the top apple at (6,9)\n   - Creates distance from enemy snake\n   - Opens up future options to move right toward (6,9)\n   - No immediate apple benefit but good positioning\n   - Avoids potential head-on collision with enemy\n\n2. RIGHT to (6,6):\n   - Moves toward the top-right area\n   - Could potentially move toward (6,9) apple\n   - But also moves closer to the edge, which could limit future options\n   - No immediate apple benefit\n   - Riskier positioning as it moves toward the corner\n\nEnemy snake considerations:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,5) with body at [(5,5), (5,4)]\n- Possible moves:\n  - UP: (4,6) - would collide with my body at (4,6)\n  - DOWN: (4,4)\n  - LEFT: (3,5)\n  - RIGHT: (5,5) - would collide with its own body\n- Most likely moves are DOWN or LEFT\n- Enemy is unlikely to move UP as it would collide with my body\n- This makes UP from my position very safe from head-on collisions\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Maintain my apple lead (5 vs 2)\n- Focus on safe positioning while moving toward remaining apples\n- Target the apple at (6,9) as it's the most isolated and safe to approach\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners or tight spaces\n- Keep multiple escape routes open\n- Be cautious of the enemy snake's potential moves\n- Try to maintain distance from the enemy while collecting apples\n\nUP is the best move because:\n1. It's completely safe from collisions\n2. It moves me toward the (6,9) apple\n3. It maintains good positioning with multiple future options\n4. It avoids any potential head-on collision risks\n5. It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n6. It doesn't move me toward any edges or corners\n\nUP",
