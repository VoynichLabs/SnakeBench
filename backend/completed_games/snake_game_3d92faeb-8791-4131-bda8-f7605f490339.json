It also leaves many future directions open.\n\n**Strategy note:** After moving left, continue heading left until we reach the apple at (1,9) or need to go down to avoid the board edge, then head toward the next closest apples (5,5) or (8,6). Keep tracking the enemy\u2019s position (still far in the bottom left) and avoid head\u2011on collisions.\n\nLEFT",

I'm perfectly positioned to continue collecting the apple at (8, 6) in just 2 more moves. The enemy snake at (5, 6) is on the same row but a different column, so there's no collision risk. This move keeps my momentum going toward efficient apple collection.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 5: Continue UP to (8, 5)\n- Turn 6: Continue UP to (8, 6) and collect the apple\n- Turn 7+: After collecting (8, 6), reassess the board. The remaining apples are at (1, 9), (0, 0), (5, 5), and (1, 1). I should plan a route to collect multiple apples efficiently while monitoring enemy movements.\n\nUP",

The nearest apples from (8, 7) are:\n- (9, 5): 2 moves away (down from my current position if I go right)\n- (1, 9): 7 moves away (left then up)\n\nThe apple at (9, 5) is reachable but requires careful navigation. Going LEFT gives me more flexibility and opens paths toward multiple apple clusters. Going UP keeps me in the middle region but moves away from nearby apples.\n\nSince I'm ahead on score, I should prioritize flexibility and avoid trapping myself. Moving LEFT to (7, 7) keeps me centralized and allows me to:\n- Move toward (1, 9) by continuing left and then up\n- Pivot down toward (9, 5) if needed\n- Maintain distance from the enemy snake at (3, 4)\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (7, 7), I'll continue moving left toward the apple cluster or reposition to grab (9, 5). Keep monitoring enemy snake #0 - it's currently at (3, 4) and could head toward the bottom-left apple cluster. Maintain a winning position by avoiding collisions while gradually collecting more apples.\n\nLEFT",
