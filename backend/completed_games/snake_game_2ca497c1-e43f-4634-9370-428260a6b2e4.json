Although the enemy could consider moving left (to (5,7)), our snake\u2019s length (4 segments) currently exceeds theirs (3 segments), which means in a head\u2010to\u2010head collision we\u2019d have the advantage.\n\nAdditional considerations:\n\u2713 Moving UP puts us directly on the apple at (5,7), allowing us to grow.\n\u2713 Our other options (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) do not bring us closer to an apple and would either be less aggressive or risk running into our own body.\n\u2713 While there is a possibility that the enemy snake might also try to move to (5,7), our advantage in length and the benefit of eating an apple make the risk acceptable.\n\nTherefore, to secure the apple and increase our advantage, our chosen next move will be: UP."
