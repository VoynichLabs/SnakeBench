          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n**Board state:**\n- Your snake (ID 0) head is at (5,1). You have no body segments yet (just the head).\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head is at (6,1), also no body.\n- Apples at: (4,3), (9,4), (4,6), (5,9), (1,5)\n\n**Potential moves:**\n- UP: (5,2)\n- DOWN: (5,0) - valid (within board)\n- LEFT: (4,1)\n- RIGHT: (6,1) - but this is occupied by snake #1's head.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each move:\n\n1. **RIGHT (to (6,1))**: This would cause a head-on collision with snake #1 (since both heads would be moving simultaneously). According to rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" So this move would kill you. Therefore, RIGHT is unsafe.\n\n2. **LEFT (to (4,1))**: This is safe. There is no apple here, and no immediate danger. Also, it moves you closer to the apple at (4,3).\n\n3. **UP (to (5,2))**: Safe. No obstacles. Not directly towards an apple, but opens up options.\n\n4. **DOWN (to (5,0))**: Safe. Within board, no obstacles.\n\nSo safe moves are: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n- The closest apple is at (4,3) - which is 2 steps away (manhattan distance: |5-4| + |1-3| = 1+2=3? Actually: from (5,1) to (4,3): dx=1, dy=2 -> total 3). Actually, wait: (4,3) is at x=4,y=3. From (5,1): going LEFT reduces x by 1 to 4, and then UP twice to get to y=3. So indeed 3 steps.\n- Another apple is at (1,5) - which is farther.\n- Also, apple at (4,6) is above.\n\nBut note: snake #1 is at (6,1). It might also be going for apples. However, since both are at same y=1, and apple at (4,3) is closer to you than to it (snake #1 is at (6,1): distance to (4,3) is |6-4|+|1-3|=2+2=4, while you are 3 away). So you have a slight advantage.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: going LEFT to (4,1) puts you in a good position to go UP to (4,2) and then to (4,3) for the apple. This is efficient.\n\nGoing UP or DOWN doesn't directly help towards an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, LEFT seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (4,3).\n\nAlso, avoid potential conflict: snake #1 might move LEFT to (5,1) (which is your current position) or UP to (6,2) etc. But since you are moving away, it should be safe.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,1), next turn plan to go UP to (4,2) to approach the apple at (4,3). Be cautious of snake #1 which might also be heading that way. Also, consider other apples if this one is taken.\n\nSo, final move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down.  \n\n**Current positions:**  \n- My head: (6, 1)  \n- Enemy head: (5, 1)  \n- Apples: (4,3), (9,4), (4,6), (5,9), (1,5)  \n\n**Possible moves:**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (6, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 0) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 1) \u2013 occupied by enemy head now, but if we both move there, head-on collision \u2192 both die. Avoid.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 1) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n\nSo **LEFT** is dangerous (possible head-on collision if enemy moves right).  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5,1):**  \n- UP: (5,2) \u2013 safe for them.  \n- DOWN: (5,0) \u2013 safe.  \n- LEFT: (4,1) \u2013 safe.  \n- RIGHT: (6,1) \u2013 my current head position; if I stay and they move right, they die (into my body? but my body is only head now, so head-on collision if I stay? Actually, if I stay still, I\u2019m not moving, but game is simultaneous moves \u2014 I must move each turn. So if I move UP and they move RIGHT, they go to (6,1) which is empty because I left it. That\u2019s fine.)  \n\nBut my main risk: If I move LEFT to (5,1) and enemy moves RIGHT to (6,1), we swap positions, no collision. Wait, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 simultaneous move: both choose destination before moving. If I choose LEFT to (5,1) and enemy chooses RIGHT to (6,1), then after move: I\u2019m at (5,1), enemy at (6,1). No collision because we\u2019re not in same cell. But if enemy chooses LEFT to (4,1) and I choose LEFT to (5,1), no issue. Only if enemy chooses RIGHT to (6,1) and I choose LEFT to (5,1), no collision. Actually, head-on collision only if we choose same destination cell. So if enemy chooses to stay in (5,1) (impossible, must move) or if enemy chooses LEFT to (4,1) and I choose LEFT to (5,1), different cells.  \n\nBut if enemy chooses RIGHT to (6,1) and I choose LEFT to (5,1), different cells.  \nIf enemy chooses UP to (5,2) and I choose LEFT to (5,1), different cells.  \n\nSo actually LEFT is safe? Wait \u2014 enemy\u2019s current position is (5,1). If I move LEFT to (5,1), I\u2019m moving into enemy\u2019s starting head position. If enemy moves away from (5,1), then (5,1) is empty when I arrive. If enemy doesn\u2019t move away (must move, so they can\u2019t stay), so they will leave (5,1). So (5,1) will be empty. So LEFT is safe in terms of collision with enemy\u2019s body? But enemy\u2019s body is only head, so if enemy moves away, their old head cell is empty. So LEFT is safe.  \n\nBut what if enemy moves RIGHT to (6,1) (my current head)? Then we swap, no collision.  \n\nSo actually LEFT is safe.  \n\nBut is there any rule about moving into a cell where enemy head was at start of turn? That\u2019s allowed if they move out.  \n\nSo all four directions are safe?  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nLEFT: (5,1) \u2013 enemy head at start, but they will move. Safe unless they choose to stay (can\u2019t).  \nUP: (6,2) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN: (6,0) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT: (7,1) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo all four are safe.  \n\n**Now choose best:**  \nClosest apple: (4,3) is 2 right, 2 up from me.  \nFrom (6,1) to (4,3): need LEFT twice and UP twice.  \n\nSo moving LEFT now gets me closer. Also, enemy is at (5,1), moving LEFT to (5,1) might make them avoid me next turn if they see me coming. But they might move UP/DOWN/LEFT themselves.  \n\nI think LEFT is fine and progresses toward apple (4,3).  \n\n**Future planning:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (5,1), next turn I\u2019ll be adjacent to apple (4,3) in two steps. Need to avoid enemy possibly at (5,2) or (4,1) etc.  \n\nGiven all safe, I\u2019ll go LEFT toward nearest apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,1), apples at (4,3) are close; prefer UP or LEFT next turn depending on safety. Watch enemy\u2019s new position.  \n\nLEFT",

If I move LEFT, enemy must move away (they can\u2019t stay). Possible enemy moves from (4,2): UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2).  \n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to (5,2) (my current cell), we swap heads \u2014 no collision.  \n  - If enemy moves elsewhere, (4,2) is empty for me.  \n  So LEFT is safe from immediate collision with enemy\u2019s starting head.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe from board edges and bodies (no bodies yet).  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision this turn:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (4,2) and enemy moves RIGHT to (5,2), we swap \u2014 safe.  \nIf I move LEFT to (4,2) and enemy moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, safe.  \nIf I move LEFT to (4,2) and enemy also moves into (4,2) from (4,2) \u2014 impossible.  \nSo LEFT is safe.  \n\n**Closest apple:** (4,3) is directly above enemy\u2019s starting head.  \nFrom my (5,2):  \n- UP to (5,3) then LEFT to (4,3) in 2 steps.  \n- LEFT to (4,2) then UP to (4,3) in 2 steps.  \nBoth equal steps.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (4,2) might go UP to (4,3) for the apple. If I go LEFT to (4,2) and enemy goes UP to (4,3), I\u2019m below the apple and enemy is on it. That\u2019s fine \u2014 they get the apple, I\u2019m safe. But I\u2019d rather get it myself.  \n\nIf I go UP to (5,3) and enemy goes UP to (4,3), we\u2019re adjacent horizontally; next turn I could go LEFT to (4,3) if enemy leaves, but if enemy stays (they grow), then (4,3) is occupied.  \n\nBetter to go LEFT now to (4,2) \u2014 if enemy goes UP to (4,3), I can go UP next turn to (4,3) only if enemy moves away (they won\u2019t if they just ate and grow). Actually, if enemy eats apple at (4,3), their tail stays at (4,2) (since they grow), so (4,3) becomes their body next turn \u2014 dangerous for me to go there.  \n\nSo maybe I should avoid letting enemy get that apple. If I go UP to (5,3), I\u2019m not blocking enemy from apple, but I\u2019m not in direct competition either.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (4,2) after LEFT: possible next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT would be back to (5,2) \u2014 safe unless enemy moves there this turn (possible if enemy goes RIGHT to (5,2) from (4,2)). If enemy goes RIGHT, they\u2019d be at (5,2) and I\u2019d be at (4,2) \u2014 fine.  \n\nFrom (5,3) after UP: next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 more options.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives more options next turn and keeps me one step from apple without stepping into enemy\u2019s starting cell. It also avoids potential immediate adjacency if enemy goes UP.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to stay flexible and approach apple from the side.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,3), if apple at (4,3) is still there and enemy not on it, go LEFT to eat it. Otherwise, consider other apples or safe exploration.  \n\nUP",
