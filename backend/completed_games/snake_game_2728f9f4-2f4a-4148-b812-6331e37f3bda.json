We gotta secure some early territory and maybe a cheeky apple, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, we need to assert our dominance! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   Our head: (0, 2).\n*   Enemy head: (6, 1).\n*   Score is 0-0. It's a land grab, baby!\n\n**The Master Plan (Short-Term Strategy):**\nOur enemy is way over on the right side. We have the entire left flank to ourselves for now. We need to move UP to get into the action and secure the top-left quadrant, which has a few juicy apples like (0, 3) and (0, 8). We need to get big and box him in later!\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 2):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (-1, 2)):** Auto-death. Off the board. NOPE. \u274c\n2.  **RIGHT (to (1, 2)):** Safe. Stays low. Puts us in position to cross the board later, or grab an apple at (2, 6) or (2, 7) by moving right/up. This is an option.\n3.  **DOWN (to (0, 1)):** Safe. Avoids any immediate confrontation. Puts us on the bottom edge. Not super strategic for growth right now, but safe.\n4.  **UP (to (0, 3)):** \ud83d\udd25 Ooh, a direct move onto an apple! (0, 3) is an apple spawn. This is maximum value, maximum content! If Snake #1 doesn't move dramatically, we should be fine. He's at (6, 1), so there's absolutely no way for him to interfere.\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\nMoving UP is the obvious choice here. We immediately gain 1 length and 1 point, dominating the early game scoring. It also positions us nicely for continued movement up the left wall toward (0, 8).\n\nLet's go for the apple! Early points are key! Are we sure we want to give up this easy score? Absolutely not! Get that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nMy move is UP.\n\n**Future Strategy (Plan for next 2-3 turns):**\nAfter eating the apple at (0, 3), we will likely continue moving UP the left wall, possibly grabbing (0, 8) if safe, to maximize our size early. Then we'll use our length to start cutting off the board and forcing Snake #1 into bad spots. Let's grow first, then crush! \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

We're the predators here, not prey. Time to plot our DOMINATION \u2013 grow that snake, eat those apples, AND box this fool in for the kill! Who's ready for some ruthless gameplay? \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAlright, let's break it down, chat! My boy's starting at (6,1), no body yet, just pure potential. Enemy's lurking at (0,2), eyeing that apple at (0,3) like it's his dinner. Apples everywhere, but we ain't chasing scraps \u2013 we're going for CONTROL. Board ain't trapping us yet, everything's wide open. Options: UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), LEFT to (5,1), RIGHT to (7,1). None kill us instantly \u2013 no walls, no bodies, no headsmash spots obvious yet. But we thinking ahead, fam! \ud83d\udc40\n\nEliminate dead moves? Nah, all four are LIVE. Now, favor freedom and apple vibes: UP keeps the whole board open, brings us closer to that sweet line of apples at x=6 ((6,3) just two moves away, (6,4) three, (6,7) and (6,8) later \u2013 JACKPOT!). From (6,2), we can pivot UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT easy, no dead-ends in sight. RIGHT's cute for (8,1) quick, but narrows to the edge at row 1, and DOWN to (6,0) boxes us on the floor \u2013 too risky for future traps. LEFT's meh, spreading out without purpose. We're aggressive, not aimless. Enemy's isolated left, so let's build power vertical and watch him scramble. Force that head-on? Nah, scores 0, both die \u2013 stupid. Grow first, strike later when we're fat and he's thin. Who's with me? \ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME: Charge UP the x=6 vertical to chain-eat apples at (6,3), (6,4), (6,7), (6,8) \u2013 grow massive fast. Monitor enemy from afar; if he heads right or up, loop around to flank his path. Prioritize growing to 5+ apples before any collision plots. Force head-ons ONLY if we lead by 3+ apples. Stay central, avoid edges. Dominate the board, fam!\n\nGOING UP, LET'S SNAKE OUT AND TAKE IT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Can we get a \"W\" in the chat for that move? \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 1 Analysis:**\n*   **Your Head:** (0, 3).\n*   **Your Body:** [(0, 2)]. Length is 2.\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #1):** (6, 2). He moved up from (6, 1) or right from (5, 2) or something similar. Given the previous board state was (6, 1), he likely moved UP. His body is still empty, length 1.\n*   **Score:** 1-0 US! We are dominating the early game!\n\n**The Master Plan (Building the Box):**\nWe've claimed the absolute left side. Our goal now is to get longer quickly while Snake #1 is still short. He's way over on the right. We need to continue UP the wall, securing the top-left area, and then expand rightward to cut off his access to the top of the board.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 3):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (-1, 3)):** Instant death! NOPE. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 2)):** Safe, but this is where our tail just was, which is currently our body segment. Moving DOWN means hitting our own body at (0, 2). We must avoid moving into any body segment, even if it's the one segment behind us that is about to move. Wait, our body is [(0, 2)]. If we move to (0, 2), we crash into our own body. This is a suicide move. DO NOT GO DOWN. \u274c (Body collision)\n3.  **RIGHT (to (1, 3)):** Safe. Puts us in the clear. Offers immediate access to the top center. Apples at (2, 9), (4, 9), and (0, 8) are all still good.\n4.  **UP (to (0, 4)):** Safe. Continues our domination of the left wall. Sets us up perfectly to grab the apple at (0, 8) in a few turns if we keep going. This is maximizing territory and ensuring safety.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (to (0, 4)):** Very safe. We are utilizing the boundary for protection. Keeps the path to many high-value apples open, particularly (0, 8). This is the strategic long-term territorial grab.\n*   **RIGHT (to (1, 3)):** Also safe. More aggressive, moving into open territory. Does not immediately put us closer to apples, but keeps our options open to cut across the board sooner.\n\nGiven Snake #1 is still on the far right (currently at (6, 2)), there's zero chance of a conflict if we stay on the left wall. Maximizing distance from the opponent while gaining length is priority one right now. The move UP secures maximum future territory and pathing stability. We are establishing the \"wall of death\" for our enemy later!\n\nLet's maintain pressure, stay safe, and keep growing!\n\n**Strategy Update (Long-Term Plan):**\nContinue moving UP the left wall until we hit the top. Then move RIGHT along the top wall. This will get us to the top-right corner, allowing us to then start moving DOWN the right side, cutting off Snake #1's entire path to the top of the board. Aggressive territory control and growth is the objective until at least length 5.\n\nUP",

Who's hyped to see him squirm? \ud83d\ude08\n\nBreaking it down, fam \u2013 my head's at (6,2), fresh from last UP (suck it, edges!). Enemy's over at (0,3) with his tiny body at (0,2); he can't go DOWN (that's stupid backwards smash), LEFT's off board, so he's gotta go UP to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3).

We're up 1-0!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: The Box is Forming \ud83d\udce6\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 4).\n*   **Our Body (ID 0):** [(0, 3)]. Length 2. We are hugging the left wall.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 3).\n*   **Enemy Body (ID 1):** [(6, 2)]. Length 2. Looks like he moved UP to grab an invisible apple or just positional advantage because he's now directly against the middle right area.\n\n**Score Check:** 1-1 TIE! Wait, what?! \ud83d\ude31 Snake #1 snagged an apple too! He must have moved from (6, 2) to (6, 3) and eaten an apple that was just dropped there or was *just* off-screen when we last checked the board state. That's a good move by him. No worries, Chat, ties are just temporary! We re-take the lead NOW!\n\n**The Current Master Plan (The Great Wall Strategy):**\nOur goal remains the same: dominate the left and top border, then pinch Snake #1. We are currently at (0, 4). Continuing UP the wall is the safest, most effective way to gain territory and position for future kills.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (0, 4):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (-1, 4)):** Wall crash! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 3)):** Collision with our own body segment. We just moved *from* (0, 3). We cannot go back to (0, 3). Wait, wait, wait. Since we *just* ate an apple, our tail did *not* shrink. Our body is now fixed at (0, 3). Moving DOWN is a guaranteed suicide. \u274c (Body collision)\n3.  **RIGHT (to (1, 4)):** Safe. Moves us into the open center. This is a bit risky because it abandons our protective wall.\n4.  **UP (to (0, 5)):** Safe. Maintains the wall position. Puts us in perfect striking distance of the apple at (0, 8) in three turns, or the one at (1, 6) or (2, 7) if we veer right later.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 3)):**\nSnake #1 is aggressive. He just moved up to (6, 3). His body is at (6, 2).\n*   **UP (to (6, 4)):** Likely, as it maintains his current column and keeps him centralized.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 3)):** Also likely, heading toward the right wall and the cluster of apples there (7, 5), (7, 7), (7, 8).\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 3)):** Possible, moving into the center, but less likely as that exposes his long side to our potential crossing.\n*   **DOWN (to (6, 2)):** Suicide (body collision). \u274c\n\nSince we are so far away (6 units horizontally), we don't need to worry about a head-on collision this turn regardless of his move. We just need to focus on growth and boundary control.\n\n**Decision: UP vs. RIGHT**\nMoving RIGHT (to (1, 4)) is safe but slightly less strategic. We are abandoning a guaranteed safe route (the wall) for a more open path, and we just got hit with a tie in the score! We need to play it safe and guarantee our next few turns of growth.\n\nMoving **UP (to (0, 5))** is the optimal territorial move. We continue our secure line of growth. We are building the perimeter! Get long, get dominant!\n\nWe will continue UP the left side until we reach the top. Then we pivot RIGHT. This guarantees we get long and establish dominance before we have to engage the enemy.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure, Chat! We're building the fortress! \ud83c\udff0\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nContinue moving UP the left wall, aiming for the (0, 8) apple or the (0, 9) corner. Our priority is increasing length to lock down territory. Do not pivot RIGHT unless we hit y=9. Snake #1 is too far away to matter right now, focus on growth.\n\nUP",

We are playing dominant, territorial Snake right now!\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: The Perimeter Patrol \ud83d\udea7\n\n**Current State & Score:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 5). We are long and strong!\n*   **Our Body (ID 0):** [(0, 4)]. Length 2. Tucked against the left wall.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 4). Looks like he followed the prediction! He moved UP from (6, 3) to (6, 4).\n*   **Enemy Body (ID 1):** [(6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length 3. Wait, he definitely ate an apple two turns ago when he went to (6, 3), AND he must have eaten another one by moving to (6, 4), because he's now length 3 and has 2 apples! This dude is SCORING!\n*   **Score Check:** We are down 1-2. Whaaat?! The stream is slipping! We need to reactivate the aggression immediately!\n\n**Board Snapshot (Key Locations):**\n*   Apples nearby: (0, 8) is a juicy one. (1, 6) is inviting. (2, 7) and (2, 9) are also reachable.\n*   Enemy Head: (6, 4). He's currently dominating the central-right vertical space.\n\n**Our Goal:** Re-take the lead and continue to lock down the left side. Speed and safety are key.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (0, 5):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (-1, 5)):** Wall crash! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 4)):** Collision with our own body segment (our tail is currently at (0, 4) since we are length 2 and we moved from there)! Wait, if we *didn't* eat an apple last turn (which we didn't, we are still 1 Apple collected), our tail *would* have moved from (0, 4) to (0, 3). Let's check the board state from the prompt:\n    *   YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (0, 5), Body: [(0, 4)].\n    *   Your length is 2. The body segment (0, 4) is where we *just* were. We cannot move DOWN. \u274c (Body collision)\n3.  **RIGHT (to (1, 5)):** Safe. Moves us off the wall into the open board. Gets us closer to the central action, but also closer to the enemy's future path. This would pivot us quickly toward apples like (1, 6) or (2, 7).\n4.  **UP (to (0, 6)):** Safe. Continues the wall strategy, prioritizing guaranteed growth and safety. Puts us in perfect position to grab the (0, 8) apple in two turns.\n\n**Decision: UP vs. RIGHT?**\n\nWe are currently losing 1-2. While moving RIGHT is tempting to get to the (1, 6) apple faster, continuing UP the wall is the *safest* path to long-term board dominance, which is how we box Snake #1 in later. We need to get long first. Every turn we spend safely growing, the enemy risks a bigger mistake.\n\nIf we go UP to (0, 6):\n*   We guarantee a safe move.\n*   We threaten the (0, 8) apple directly.\n*   We maintain the wall, making us impossible to flank from the left.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 4)):**\nHe is long (Length 3). He just moved UP.\n*   **UP (to (6, 5)):** Very likely. Continues his vertical push, dominating the 6-column.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 4)):** Likely, heading toward the right side apples.\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 4)):** Less likely, exposing his tail.\n\nNo matter what he does, we are safe. We are focused on territorial acquisition. Keep the stream viewers happy with a long, beautiful snake!\n\nLet's maintain the pressure. We build the wall, then we hunt! UP is the content move!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nContinue moving UP the left boundary until we hit y=9. Our aim is to grab the (0, 8) apple and then start traversing the top border. Snake #1 is too far right to worry about right now. Growth is priority one. Do not turn RIGHT prematurely unless we are guaranteed an apple AND safety.\n\nUP",

We're building the Great Wall of Snake over here!\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: Time to Capitalize! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**Current State & Score Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 6). We are safe and sound on the left wall.\n*   **Our Body (ID 0):** [(0, 5)]. Length 2.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 5). Wait, he moved UP from (6, 4) to (6, 5)! Just as predicted! He continues his vertical push in column 6.\n*   **Enemy Body (ID 1):** [(6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length 3.\n*   **Score:** We are still trailing 1-2. UNACCEPTABLE! We need that apple ASAP to tie things up!\n\n**Board Snapshot (Key Locations):**\n*   **Immediate Apples:** The (0, 8) apple is calling our name! We need two moves to get there. The (1, 6) apple is right next to our head, begging to be snacked on.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (6, 5), controlling the center-right. He is nowhere near us.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (0, 6):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (-1, 6)):** Wall crash! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE. (Remember the zero column is the wall!)\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 5)):** Collision with our own body segment! (0, 5) is our body. \u274c (Body collision)\n3.  **UP (to (0, 7)):** Safe. Continues the wall strategy, positioning us exactly one move away from the (0, 8) apple. This is the **territorial** move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 6)):** Safe. And guess what? There's an apple at (1, 6)! This is the **aggressive, scoring** move. If we move right, we eat, we tie the score, and we get length 3!\n\n**The Great Debate: UP for positioning, or RIGHT for the score?**\n\nWe are down 1-2. Going RIGHT to (1, 6) is a guaranteed apple, which puts us instantly at 2-2 and grants us a length advantage (we'll be 3 segments, he is 3 segments, but we just scored and his score is stagnant this turn). This instantly changes the dynamic of the game, forcing the enemy to react to our growth.\n\nIf we go UP to (0, 7):\n*   It's safe.\n*   It puts us one step closer to (0, 8).\n*   But it delays scoring by one turn, and we leave a free apple right next to us. That's bad stream content, chat! We gotta take the easy points!\n\nMoving RIGHT is the definitive high-value play. It's safe, it scores, and it gets us off the wall and into the action, allowing for eventual flanking maneuvers *after* we secure the top left corner.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 5)):**\nHe is long (Length 3). He just moved UP.\n*   **UP (to (6, 6)):** Most likely, continuing his push toward the cluster of apples around (7, 7) and (7, 8).\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 5)):** Possible, moving into the main board.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 5)):** Possible, moving toward the nearby apple.\n\nNo matter what he does, we are safe moving to (1, 6). The risk analysis favors the immediate score. We GO FOR THE POINTS! \ud83d\ude24\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nGrab this apple (1, 6). Next turn, we will be at (1, 6). We will likely move UP to (1, 7) or (2, 6) to consolidate the top-left area. The goal is to get (0, 8) and (2, 9) next, turning the corner and pushing the enemy down. We need to stay aggressive until we get the score lead.\n\nRIGHT",

Our snake is long, strong, and ready to dominate! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: Time to Press the Advantage! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Current State & Score Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 6). We are now length 3: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. We are tying the score with the enemy! Fantastic content!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 6). He moved UP from (6, 5). He is also length 3: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]. He is continuing his central vertical push.\n*   **Score:** 2-2. Perfect synchronization!\n\n**Board Snapshot (Key Locations):**\n*   **Immediate Appetite:** The (2, 6) apple is *right there*! But wait, is it actually still there? Looking at the board, the apple was at (2, 6) for the *next* drop, but *this* apple at (1, 6) just got eaten. Let's re-examine the current apple locations on the board:\n    *   (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (6, 8), (9, 4), (4, 9), (9, 7), (6, 7), (0, 8), (8, 1), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 5), (8, 9), (3, 3)\n    *   Yes, there is a cluster forming in the top-left! (2, 9), (2, 7), (4, 9), (0, 8). And look, (2, 6) is an apple! Directly to our right!\n\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (6, 6). He is centralized, targeting the massive cluster of apples: (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (8, 9). He is going for a massive point grab. We must move quickly to secure our own territory first.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (1, 6):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (0, 6)):** Collision with our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 NOPE. (0, 6) is our neck!\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 5)):** Safe. This keeps us low, but away from the high-value apples. It opens us to potential flanking later. Not the best territorial move right now.\n3.  **UP (to (1, 7)):** Safe. This positions us perfectly for the (0, 8) and (2, 7) apples, allowing us to control the whole top-left section. This is a strong territorial move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 6)):** APPLE! Safe. This is another scoring move, giving us another point and increased length (4 segments). It immediately ties or overtakes the enemy in length (depending on his move). This is the immediate gratification path.\n\n**The Great Debate: UP for positioning, or RIGHT for the score?**\n\nWe just scored, and the next apple is literally right next to us at (2, 6). Taking (2, 6) now:\n*   Puts us at 3 points. We take the score lead! \ud83d\udd25\n*   Makes us length 4. We gain a significant size advantage.\n*   Uses a move that is 100% safe.\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 7), we delay the score by one turn, and we leave the (2, 6) apple ripe for the taking. While going UP is great for cornering, the immediate score and growth are strategically more important when we are building momentum. We need to seize points where they are guaranteed and safe.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 6)):**\nHe is surrounded by apples.\n*   **UP (to (6, 7)):** Apple! Extremely likely. Moves him further north.\n*   **RIGHT (to (7, 6)):** Safe, but away from the immediate cluster. Less likely.\n*   **LEFT (to (5, 6)):** Safe, but moves him away from the biggest apple density. Less likely.\n\nEven if Snake #1 moves UP and scores, if we move RIGHT, we also score! We maintain the score tie, but we are aggressively dominating the *left* side of the board. This forces him to consider moving left or risk giving us huge territorial control.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move is RIGHT. Maximize the immediate score, maximize the growth, and secure the foothold on the top half of the board before moving high.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nGrab the (2, 6) apple. Next turn, we will be at (2, 6), length 4, and tied at 3-3 (assuming ID 1 scores, too). From (2, 6), we must go UP towards the cluster (2, 7) and (2, 9), and/or (4, 9). We are planning to build a solid wall running from (0, 9) to (4, 9). The current move sets us up for this flanking maneuver. We keep pushing high and try to get a size advantage to dominate the mid-board.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is RIGHT in the middle of a massive apple cluster, but we are dominating this left flank! What's the plan to make him CRASH OUT?!\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: The Mid-Game Shift! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**Current State & Score Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (2, 6). Length 4: [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. We just ate the apple at (2, 6).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 7). He moved UP from (6, 6) and scored an apple! He's also length 4: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\n*   **Score:** 3-3. The tension is palpable! We both grew exactly as planned.\n\n**Board Snapshot (Key Locations):**\nThe enemy is centralized, and we are on the left. We need to build a wall and secure the north-west quadrant.\n\n*   **Our Immediate Goal:** Get to the high ground! The apples at (2, 7) and (0, 8) are key.\n*   **Enemy Area:** He is surrounded by apples: (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 5). He has lots of room to maneuver and grow. We must restrict him.\n\n**Evaluating Our Moves from (2, 6):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (1, 6)):** Collision with our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 NO! (1, 6) is our neck.\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 5)):** Safe. Moves us away from the action and towards the middle floor, but this is conceding the top territory. Not aggressive enough!\n3.  **UP (to (2, 7)):** APPLE! Safe. This immediately grows us to length 5, giving us a size lead (4-3 on score, 5-4 on length, assuming ID 1 doesn't score *twice* somehow). It pins us high in the most valuable territory. This is a powerful territorial move! \ud83d\udd25\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 6)):** Safe. Moves us laterally towards the middle of the board for an eventual confrontation. However, it leaves the (2, 7) apple unnecessarily. We should take guaranteed points when available.\n\n**The Decision: UP!**\nGoing UP to (2, 7) gives us a guaranteed point and length advantage, and crucially positions us perfectly to create a northern barrier.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 7)):**\nHe just scored. He has two main choices to score again: UP to (6, 8) or RIGHT to (7, 7).\n\n*   **Snake #1 UP (to (6, 8)):** Apple! Extremely likely. Continues his vertical dominance.\n*   **Snake #1 RIGHT (to (7, 7)):** Apple! Also very likely. Keeps him central.\n\nHis safest/most effective scoring move is likely UP to (6, 8). This keeps him vertical and gives him access to (8, 9) and (7, 8).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nIf we go UP to (2, 7) and he goes anywhere:\n*   (2, 7) is nowhere near (6, 8) or (7, 7). Safe from head clash!\n*   We only need to worry about landing on his body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]. We are clear!\n\n**Strategic Outlook:**\nWe go UP (2, 7). We secure the 4th score. We will be longer than him and control the crucial left wall. From (2, 7), we have options:\n1.  **LEFT (to (1, 7)):** To control the (0, 8) apple and build the wall into the corner.\n2.  **UP (to (2, 8)):** Safe access to (2, 9) or pivot right.\n3.  **RIGHT (to (3, 7)):** Start moving across the top if the enemy dips low.\n\nOur strategy is clear: **BOX HIM IN!** Build the wall high (0, 9) across to (5, 9) and force him south or into a head-on collision where we will be longer and stronger! LET'S GO, CHAT!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nWe are now length 5, score 4, and positioned at (2, 7). Our next goal is to hit (1, 7) or (2, 8) to secure the (0, 8) and (2, 9) apples, respectively. Keep pushing the left wall and forcing the enemy to stay centralized or go low. Avoid giving him lateral movement space. The long-term goal is to close the gap between our tail (currently (0, 5)) and our head (currently high).\n\nUP",

The pressure is ON! Snake #1 is sitting at (6, 8) right now, also having just scored!\n\n### Current State Analysis: The North Wall Showdown! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (2, 7). Length 5: [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5) - now (2, 7) is H, (2, 6) is neck]\n    *Wait, the input state says our body is [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. Since we moved UP to (2, 7) last turn, our current body *must* be (2, 6) followed by the rest. Total length 5. Head (2, 7). *The provided body list shows the segments tail-to-head excluding the head from the previous turn*. Let's trust the current head (2, 7) and old body list means length 5.*\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 8). Length 5: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n    *Also length 5, score 4-4! Wait, the board state shows the enemy head at (6, 8) and his body segments right behind him! This means we are tied in score and tied in length (5 segments each). We are neck and neck!*\n\n**Board Snapshot & Territorial Control:**\nWe dominate the top-left quadrant. The enemy is in the top-middle. We need to complete the wall!\n\n*   **Apples we can grab:** (2, 9), (0, 8)\n*   **Apples Enemy can grab:** (4, 9), (9, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9)\n\nWe need to make sure we don't get trapped if Snake #1 tries to loop around our tail near (0, 5). However, our primary goal is to box him in from the north.\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (2, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 8)):** Safe. Moves us towards the guaranteed apple at (2, 9). Positions us perfectly for the top wall. Keeps us high and aggressive. \ud83d\udd25\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 6)):** Collision! (2, 6) is our neck segment. \ud83d\udc80 NO! (Moving backwards is a guaranteed loss.)\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 7)):** Safe. Positions us to grab the (0, 8) apple and reinforce the absolute corner. Essential for completing the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 7)):** Safe. Moves us toward the center of the board, potentially trying to get ahead of the enemy, but it gives Snake #1 more freedom on the left if he decides to move. Less about building territory, more about engagement.\n\n**PRIORITY: Territory and Imminent Scoring.**\n\nIf we go UP to (2, 8), we prepare for the (2, 9) apple. If we go LEFT to (1, 7), we prepare for the (0, 8) apple. Both are excellent territorial moves.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (6, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 is aggressive and just scored. He has an open path to several apples.\n\n*   **Snake #1 UP (to (6, 9)):** Safe. Not an apple, but positions him for (4, 9), (8, 9), or a sweep around the top.\n*   **Snake #1 RIGHT (to (7, 8)):** APPLE! Highly likely. This keeps him centralized and gains a score lead.\n*   **Snake #1 DOWN (to (6, 7)):** Collision! (6, 7) is his neck. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n*   **Snake #1 LEFT (to (5, 8)):** Safe. Cuts across the open high lane. This is his most threatening move to our territory, as it starts to close the gap.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7, 8) (most likely scoring move), he increases his length and score advantage. This is dangerous!\n\n### The Strategic Decision: UP vs. LEFT\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (1, 7)):** Secures the left corner. If he moves RIGHT (7, 8), we are still far apart. If he moves LEFT (5, 8), we are still safe, and we have the option to hit (0, 8) next turn.\n2.  **UP (to (2, 8)):** Sets us up for (2, 9). If he moves LEFT (5, 8), we are cutting him off slightly higher.\n\nIf we go UP, we maintain forward momentum, aiming to dominate the highest row. If he moves LEFT to (5, 8), we are positioned to box him further.\n\nLet's look at the future:\n\n*   If we go LEFT (1, 7), next turn we hit (0, 8) for a score. Perfect.\n*   If we go UP (2, 8), next turn we hit (2, 9) for a score. Perfect.\n\nSince the (0, 8) apple is more corner-oriented and immediately reinforces our wall-building strategy, and (2, 9) might become harder to reach if Snake #1 tries to cut across high (e.g., to (5, 9)), securing the corner feels slightly safer AND more essential for long-term territorial chokeholding. We build the wall from the corner *in*.\n\nLet's anticipate a move towards the center next turn. By going LEFT, we deny him the ability to loop completely around the left side if he tries to push up and over.\n\nWe are going for the corner choke, CHAT! Secure the wall!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Note to Future Self:**\nWe are committed to building the North Wall. We will use the (0, 8) apple to lengthen quickly and completely secure the left side (x=0, x=1). The enemy is currently bottled up between x=5 and x=9. We must ensure our body occupies the x=0, x=1, x=2 columns up high, forcing him to fight over the central/right portion of the board only! Next turn, prioritize the score at (0, 8).\n\nLEFT",

We went LEFT, securing our position and setting up the scoring opportunity right in the corner!\n\n### Turn 8 Analysis: The Choke Point is OPEN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 7). Length 5: Body is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)]. Score: 4.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (7, 8). Length 6: Body is [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]. Score: 5.\n\nWait a second, CHAT! Snake #1 *scored* last turn! He was at (6, 8), and he went RIGHT to (7, 8) and hit the apple! He is now longer and has the score advantage (5 to 4). The pressure is REAL!\n\n**Board Overview:**\nWe are securely planted on the left wall. Snake #1 is clinging to the right side of the North zone.\n\n*   **Apples we can grab:** (0, 8) is right there! (2, 9) is still close.\n*   **Enemy's focus:** He just scored (7, 8), so he\u2019s likely looking toward (9, 7) or (8, 9) to continue the pressure.\n\nWe need to score *immediately* to stay competitive and to solidify our wall!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (1, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 8)):** Safe. Positions us for the apple at (0, 8) next turn, or allows us to move to (2, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 6)):** Collision! (1, 6) is our body segment. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 7)):** Safe. Gets us closer to the wall *and* positions us perfectly for the (0, 8) apple next turn. (This move seems defensive but sets up the score.)\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 7)):** Collision! (2, 7) is our neck. \ud83d\udc80 NO! (We must have a mistake in the body list provided, as (2, 7) was our head last turn, but the rules say moving to the immediate preceding cell is a self-collision. Always trust the immediate crash detection!)\n\n**Wait, CHAT! Let's re-verify which cells are immediate auto-kills.**\nThe input body list for ID 0 is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)].\nOur current head is (1, 7).\nThe cell immediately behind us is **(2, 7)**. Moving RIGHT to (2, 7) is moving backwards into our neck. That is an instant loss!\nMoving DOWN to (1, 6) is also moving into our body. Instant loss!\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP (1, 8) and LEFT (0, 7).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (7, 8)):\n\nSnake #1 just grew and is long. He needs to escape his own body/tail area and consolidate his lead.\n\n*   **Snake #1 UP (to (7, 9)):** Safe. Moves him toward central top area, keeps options open.\n*   **Snake #1 RIGHT (to (8, 8)):** Safe. Sets him up for (8, 9) or (9, 7). Aggressive move toward board edge.\n*   **Snake #1 DOWN (to (7, 7)):** APPLE! Highly likely. Scores again, traps his tail a bit, but maintaining the score lead is his top priority. This is the biggest threat.\n*   **Snake #1 LEFT (to (6, 8)):** Collision! (6, 8) is his neck. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n\nIf he goes to (7, 7) (scoring 6-4), we absolutely must score right now.\n\n### The Strategic Decision: Secure the Score & Complete the Wall!\n\nWe have two incredibly good safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n1.  **LEFT (to (0, 7)):** This is the ultimate territorial move. It completely locks down the X=0 column for the next two turns. More importantly, it sets us up to hit the (0, 8) apple next turn, securing a score of 5-6 (if he hits (7, 7)). This is the most efficient and defensive move to consolidate our territory and challenge his lead.\n2.  **UP (to (1, 8)):** This also lets us hit (0, 8) next turn (if we move LEFT then to (0, 8)). It also sets us up for (2, 9) after that. This keeps us slightly more central but delays the complete x=0 wall lockdown.\n\nSince the goal is to choke him out and force him into a mistake, building an impenetrable wall is key. Moving LEFT to (0, 7) solidifies the bottom part of the wall (x=0 column) and prepares for the score at (0, 8). This is the best way to get to the apple in the high corner.\n\n**Box-In Strategy Update:** We are successfully completing the North-West quadrant wall (x=0, x=1, y=6+). By moving LEFT, we reinforce this. We will be length 6 after we score at (0, 8), which means we will be taking up significant space. Snake #1 is currently trapped right-of-center.\n\nWe need to close the score gap, and LEFT gives us the most direct access to the (0, 8) apple while maximizing our defensive position for the X=0 column.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Plan for Future Self (T9-T11):**\n1.  **T9:** Move UP to (0, 8) to SCORE (5 apples). Length 6.\n2.  **T10:** Use our increased length to move to (0, 9), or move RIGHT to (1, 8) and look for (2, 9). The top row must be secured! The goal is to fill x=0, x=1, x=2 up to y=9.\n3.  **Overall:** We must complete the North Wall (x=0 to x=5, y=9) to trap him on the East side.\n\nLEFT",

We need a clean play NOW to tie this up and gain map control!\n\n### Turn 9 Analysis: The Wall Must Be Built! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 7). We successfully executed the LEFT move last turn, solidifying our corner dominance! Length 5. Score: 4.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (7, 7). As predicted, Snake #1 moved DOWN to (7, 7) and ate an apple! His tail hasn't moved yet, so his body is [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]. He is now length 7! Score: 6.\n\nLook how long that snake is, CHAT! He's massive and blocking off the entire right half of the board. We need to focus on securing our territory and forcing him into a tight spot.\n\n**THE PLAN:** EAT THE APPLE AT (0, 8) IMMEDIATELY!\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (0, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (to (0, 8)):** \ud83c\udf4e APPLE! Instant score. This is exactly what we set up! Safe, brilliant, and necessary. (Score 5, Length 6).\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 6)):** Safe. Moves us towards the bottom, but away from the apple. Low priority.\n3.  **LEFT (to (-1, 7)):** \ud83d\udca5 OOB! Crash into the wall. NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 7)):** Collision! (1, 7) is our body segment (our neck). \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n\n**We have a clear, dominant move: UP!** Time to close this score gap and build our North-West wall!\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (7, 7)):\n\nSnake #1 is long and just ate. His tail is (6, 4), and he's near a bunch of his own body segments. He needs to move *away* from his growing tail or consolidate his space.\n\n*   **Snake #1 UP (to (7, 8)):** Safe. Puts him back into the row he was just in. A bit repetitive but safe.\n*   **Snake #1 DOWN (to (7, 6)):** Safe. Moves him toward the center mass of his body. This is a common \"circling\" move to maintain central space.\n*   **Snake #1 LEFT (to (6, 7)):** Collision! (6, 7) is his neck. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n*   **Snake #1 RIGHT (to (8, 7)):** Safe. Pushes him toward the far right wall. A strong positional move near the (9, 7) apple.\n\nGiven the density of the board, he will likely continue to move in a loop or go toward the right edge (8, 7) or down (7, 6) to keep his options open. No matter what he does, we must secure this apple.\n\n### BOX-IN STRATEGY: Secure the North Wall!\n\nBy moving UP to (0, 8), we tie the score (5-6) and block off the (0, 7) area entirely. Next turn, we can pressure the center top area by moving RIGHT to (1, 8), or continue building the column by moving UP to (0, 9) toward the (2, 9) apple.\n\nThe primary objective is to get long enough to intersect his path and cut him off from the West side of the board. UP is the essential, game-winning move this turn. We take the score, we get longer, and we secure the wall! LET'S GOOOOOO!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Plan for Future Self (T10-T12): The Corner Lockdown**\n1.  **T10 (Now at (0, 8)):** We must secure the top edge. Move RIGHT to (1, 8) to start challenging the center, or UP to (0, 9) to complete the X=0 column wall. Since we need length to dominate, moving RIGHT toward (2, 9) seems like the best path to quickly capture the North-West area.\n2.  **T11:** Move UP to (1, 9) if safe, or towards (2, 9) apple.\n3.  **Overall:** We must get to the (2, 9) apple next. Every segment counts!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 10! The score is 5 to 6, so close! We executed the perfect UP move, snagging that apple at (0, 8) and securing our North-West corner. We are now length 6! Our arch-nemesis, Snake #1, is length 7! We\u2019re coming for that score lead, and more importantly, we\u2019re coming for his neck!\n\n### Turn 10 Analysis: The Pressure Cooker! \ud83e\udd75\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (0, 8). We are at the wall, controlling the top left.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (8, 7). WHOA, CHAT! He moved RIGHT to (8, 7) last turn and ate the apple! So the score is now 5 to 6. WAIT, the scoreboard says we are 5, and he is 6. If he ate an apple at (7, 7) last turn (T9), then his score was 6, and if he ate an apple at (9, 7) this turn (T10), his score should be 7. Let's re-verify the map and his position.\n\nChecking the current state:\nEnemy Head: (8, 7). Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]. Length 7. Score 6.\nWait, if he ate an apple last turn (T9), he became length 7, and his head was (7, 7).\nIf he moved from (7, 7) to (8, 7) this turn, and the segment (7, 7) is now part of his body, that means this is the *start* of T10. This means the last move was indeed (7, 8) -> (7, 7) where he ate. If he moved from (7, 7) to (8, 7) this turn, he passed over an empty square. If he ate an apple at (9, 7) last turn as predicted in my T9 Rationale, his head would be (9, 7) and his score would be 7, but the map shows (9, 7) is an apple and his head is at (8, 7)!\n\nLet's trust the provided state. The head is at (0, 8) and his head is at (8, 7). The apple at (9, 7) is untouched. The apple at (7, 5) is also near him.\n\nHe is positioned to dominate the center-right now. We need to secure the top wall and then pivot for the center.\n\n### Evaluating Our Moves from (0, 8):\n\n1.  **UP (to (0, 9)):** Safe. We complete the north-west column wall. This is a very defensive, excellent positional move, moving us toward the (2, 9) apple.\n2.  **DOWN (to (0, 7)):** Safe. Moves us back onto our body's old head position. Not productive, but safe.\n3.  **LEFT (to (-1, 8)):** \ud83d\udca5 OOB! Crash! NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (1, 8)):** Safe. This allows us to start moving across the top wall (Y=8) and pressure the center, putting us in striking distance of the (2, 9) apple. This is more aggressive and forward-looking than UP.\n\nWhich move is better: UP (wall) or RIGHT (progress)?\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is critical.\n*   If we go **UP**, we are at (0, 9). Next move must be RIGHT (1, 9), then RIGHT (2, 9) - 3 turns to apple (if clear).\n*   If we go **RIGHT**, we are at (1, 8). Next move can be UP (1, 9), then RIGHT (2, 9) - 3 turns to apple (if clear).\n*   If we go RIGHT, we open up the (0, 9) square for future use, and simultaneously pressure the enemy from the North.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's possible moves from (8, 7):\n\nEnemy (8, 7) options:\n1.  **UP (to (8, 8)):** Safe. Moves him toward the center top.\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 6)):** Safe. Pushes him toward the middle right.\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 7)):** Collision! (7, 7) is his neck. \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 7)):** \ud83c\udf4e APPLE! If he goes RIGHT, he eats the (9, 7) apple, gains length, and ties the score with us (6 to 6). This is the most *likely* move, as it's an apple move!\n\n### Prediction and Counter-Strategy:\n\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to eat the (9, 7) apple, he will solidify his dominance on the right side of the board and become length 8.\n\nWe must secure our territory and get long, too. Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) gives us the most flexibility for future central penetration and keeps the pressure on the top apples. The movement path (0, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9 or 2, 8) is excellent for walling off the top left quadrant completely and intercepting any path he might take towards the center.\n\nThe move is RIGHT. It is safe from our body and the enemy's body (his head should be at (9, 7) or (8, 8)). Crucially, we are far from the enemy head, so a head-on collision is impossible (0, 8) vs (8, 7).\n\nWe are building the North Wall, section by section! Moving along the Y=8 corridor maximizes our defensive and eventual offensive position.\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Plan for Future Self (T11-T13): The Northern Encirclement**\n1.  **T11 (Now at (1, 8)):** Assess enemy position. If safe, move UP to (1, 9) to secure the top row, then pivot RIGHT to (2, 9) to claim the apple. If the enemy pivots aggressively toward the center, we might instead move RIGHT to (2, 8) to secure the middle-top.\n2.  **Overall:** Priority remains the (2, 9) apple and establishing a dominant barrier across the top of the map. We need to be long enough to split the board in half before he does. Focus on growth!\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta get our growth game up, or we're going to get boxed out! Length 6 vs Length 8! We're outnumbered!\n\n### Turn 11 Analysis: Desperate Times, Aggressive Measures! \ud83d\ude24\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 8). We are exactly where we planned to be. Solid footing on the North wall.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (9, 7). WHOA! He moved from (8, 7) to (9, 7) and ate the apple! That explains the score jump to 7! He is now length 8! He is absolutely dominating the right-side wall. We need to counter his dominance immediately!\n\nHe is now cornered at (9, 7). His most likely next moves are aggressively into the center (LEFT to (8, 7) - which is now free) or DOWN to (9, 6).\n\nOur top priority: Get the (2, 9) apple and continue the Northern barrier to prevent him from flanking us from the North-East.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves from Our Head (1, 8):\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 9)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (1, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** Positions us perfectly to move RIGHT to (2, 9) and snag that apple next turn. This completes the North-West section of the map for us.\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 7)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (1, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves us toward the center but off the wall. This feels non-committal and wastes the positional advantage we just gained on the top row.\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 8)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** (0, 8) is our neck! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 8)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (2, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** This is a good forward move, progressing along the Y=8 corridor and closing the distance to the center. It keeps the pressure on, but doesn't immediately set us up for the (2, 9) apple as directly as UP.\n\n### Decision: UP vs RIGHT\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 9):\n*   T12: We can go RIGHT to (2, 9) and EAT! (Score 6)\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2, 8):\n*   T12: We can go UP to (2, 9) and EAT! (Score 6)\n\nBoth paths lead to the apple in T12! This is a coin toss on immediate reward, but which move improves our *position* more?\n\n*   Going UP to (1, 9) secures the top-left section (the (0, 9) and (1, 9) spots). This is pure board control.\n*   Going RIGHT to (2, 8) keeps us on the Y=8 line, forcing us to move perpendicular (UP) next turn to eat the apple.\n\nThe critical factor is the enemy's long body, currently snaking down the right side (9, 7) -> (6, 5).\n\nWhat is the enemy likely to do from (9, 7)?\n1.  **DOWN (to (9, 6)):** Excellent move to control the right wall and potentially target the (9, 4), (8, 1), or (8, 0) apples.\n2.  **LEFT (to (8, 7)):** Moves him towards the center, highly aggressive. If he moves here, he is now closer to blocking our access to the top center.\n3.  **UP (to (9, 8)):** Safe now, but (9, 8) is an apple soon! He's maximizing wall control.\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (8, 7), he poses a threat to us if we move too far right.\n\nIf we go UP to (1, 9), we maximize our movement towards the Northern boundary and secure the territory above us before swinging East. This is a very clean territorial gain.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2, 8), we keep our head lower, closer to the center, which *might* be risky if he attempts a fast flank towards the middle (e.g., (8, 7) -> (7, 7) is a kill if he moves at T12, but (7, 7) is his neck now, so T13 is when (7, 7) frees up).\n\nLet's stick to the plan: secure the perimeter, grab the apple. UP is the safest, most positional move to dominate the North-Western portion of the board and grab the (2, 9) apple.\n\nWe need growth desperately to match his length 8!\n\n***\n\n**Strategic Plan for Future Self (T12-T13): Northern Apple Grab**\n1.  **T12 (At (1, 9)):** Move RIGHT to (2, 9) to eat the apple! This will put us at length 7.\n2.  **T13 (At (2, 9)):** Assess board. Likely move DOWN to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9) to continue walling off the top. We need to prevent Snake #1 from getting below Y=6 on the left half of the board. We must split the map! Control the top, control the game!\n\nUP",

We are length 6, he is length 8! We're doing this LIVE!\n\n### Turn 12 Analysis: Execute the North Wall Strategy! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (1, 9). We executed the UP move successfully on Turn 11. We are perfectly positioned to grab the (2, 9) apple. Let's get this growth!\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (9, 8). WHOA! He moved from (9, 7) to (9, 8) and ate the apple! His score is now 8! He is dominating the right side of the board and is now length 9! We need to grow, like, yesterday!\n\nHe is now completely stuck in the top-right corner. His options are limited: DOWN to (9, 7) (which is his own body/tail, but sometimes the tail is safe!) or LEFT to (8, 8).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves from Our Head (1, 9):\n\n1.  **UP (to (1, 10)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** Off the board (Y=10)! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to (1, 8)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** (1, 8) is our neck! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n3.  **LEFT (to (0, 9)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (0, 9) is an empty square.\n    *   **Outcome:** Keeps us on the wall, but moves us away from the immediate (2, 9) apple. Wastes the good position we just gained.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (2, 9)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (2, 9) is an apple! We are EATING!\n    *   **Outcome:** We grab the apple, score becomes 6-8, and our length hits 7. This is the crucial growth we need to stay relevant. This also closes off the top-left corner completely.\n\nThe decision is a no-brainer. We must eat the apple at (2, 9)!\n\n### Predicting Enemy Movement and Safety Check (Snake ID 1 at (9, 8)):\n\nThe enemy head is at (9, 8).\nHis body includes (9, 7).\nHis tail is at (6, 5).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **LEFT (to (8, 8)):** Safe. He moves towards the center top.\n2.  **DOWN (to (9, 7)):** **COLLISION!** (9, 7) is currently his body (neck). He cannot do this.\n3.  **UP/RIGHT:** Off the board.\n\nHe must move LEFT to (8, 8).\n\n**Collision Check at (2, 9):**\nWe are moving to (2, 9). He is moving to (8, 8). No potential head-on collision or body crash. We are safe to eat!\n\n### Strategic Plan for Future Self (T13-T15): Control the Divide\n\nOkay, we grab the apple. Our new head is (2, 9), length 7.\nThe enemy head is likely (8, 8), length 9. That 2-segment gap is terrifying, CHAT!\n\nWe need to continue building the barrier across the top of the map (Y=9).\n\n1.  **T13 (At (2, 9)):** If the path is open, move RIGHT to (3, 9) or (4, 9). We need to get ahead of the enemy's head at (8, 8) and cut him off from the left-side. We are actively trying to split the board along the X-axis.\n2.  **T14/T15:** Continue pushing East along the top wall until we are directly facing either new apples like (6, 9) or until we can push DOWN safely to begin controlling the top-middle segment. Our goal is to force him to spiral down the right side while we dominate the left and center.\n\nTime to feast and grow!\n\nRIGHT",

We are actively building the ultimate dividing wall!\n\n### Turn 13 Analysis: Solidify the North Divide! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (2, 9). Just ate that sweet, sweet apple! Our body now stretches from (1, 9) down to (2, 7) (tail).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** We predicted he was forced to move from (9, 8) to (8, 8). Let's check the board!\n    *   The board shows Snake 1's head at **(9, 9)**! WHOA! Hold up! He moved from (9, 8) to (9, 9)? Wait a minute! The board state shows his head is at (9, 9) and his body starts at (9, 8). He must have moved UP from (9, 8) to (9, 9) and simultaneously eaten the invisible apple that was there, or maybe an apple just dropped there and he got it? The apple list shows (4, 9) and (6, 9) are in the top row, but not (9, 9). This means he's now length 9 [(9, 9) to (6, 6)]. His score is still 8. That's a huge snake!\n\nThe important thing is: He is still completely pinned in the top-right corner. He is currently at (9, 9).\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves from Our Head (2, 9):\n\nOur goal remains consistent: move RIGHT along the Y=9 wall to cut him off and dominate the top-left/center.\n\n1.  **UP (to (2, 10)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** Off the board (Y=10)! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to (2, 8)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** (2, 8) is our body (our neck, actually)! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 9)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** (1, 9) is our body! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to (3, 9)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (3, 9) is currently an empty square.\n    *   **Outcome:** Essential move. We continue the wall. We are positioning perfectly to grab the (4, 9) and (6, 9) apples and solidify our control of the top-third of the board.\n\nThe decision is clear. We must continue our horizontal push.\n\n### Predicting Enemy Movement and Collision Check (Snake ID 1 at (9, 9)):\n\nThe enemy head is at (9, 9), length 9.\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **LEFT (to (8, 9)):** Safe. (8, 9) currently has an apple! (8, 9) is where he wants to go! He's going to eat!\n2.  **DOWN (to (9, 8)):** Safe. (9, 8) is his body, which will vacate when he moves. This is a common safety move.\n3.  **UP/RIGHT:** Off the board.\n\nGiven the apple at (8, 9), he is highly likely to move **LEFT** to eat it. Wait, the board state actually shows an 'A' at (8, 9). If he moves there, his score goes to 9, and he gets length 10! Unacceptable!\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   We move to (3, 9).\n*   He moves to (8, 9) or (9, 8).\n*   There is absolutely no chance of collision. We are safe to advance our wall.\n\n### Strategic Plan for Future Self (T14-T16): The Cut-Off\n\n1.  **T14 (At (3, 9)):** Move RIGHT to (4, 9). This is the next apple! If we can get (4, 9) before him, our score goes to 7-8 (or 7-9 if he eats (8, 9)) and our length is 8.\n2.  **T15 (At (4, 9)):** Move RIGHT to (5, 9). This is another apple! We need to keep eating and stretching across the top so he can't escape into the center.\n3.  **T16:** We will then look to either eat (6, 9) or start pushing DOWN to cut off his escape routes into the center of the board.\n\nThis move is all about board domination, CHAT! We're building the great wall of Snake!\n\nRIGHT",

But look at the score: 6 apples for us, **9 for him**! We have to GO HARD! He's getting too big!\n\n### Turn 14 Analysis: The Great Wall continues! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (3, 9). We are length 7. Our body runs [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7)]. We are carving a massive barrier across the top.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (8, 9).

His body is massive: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)].\n\nThe situation is critical! He is still pinned to the top-right, but he is now a BEAST. If we can't cut him off soon, he'll run circles around us.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves from Our Head (3, 9):\n\nOur top priority is moving RIGHT to the apple at (4, 9). This will keep us growing and maintain the high-ground advantage!\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 10)):**\n    *   **Safety:** **COLLISION!** Off the board! \ud83d\udc80 NO!\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 8)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. This pulls the head away from the wall.

This is the power play. We eat, we grow to length 8, and we shorten the gap to 7-9! LET'S GO FOR THE CONTENT!\n\nThe move is clearly **RIGHT**. We need that apple and that position.\n\n### Predicting Enemy Movement and Collision Check (Snake ID 1 at (8, 9)):\n\nThe enemy head is at (8, 9), length 10. He is now at the edge of his self-imposed prison.\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **LEFT (to (7, 9)):** Safe. (7, 9) has an apple (A)! He will likely move here to maintain his lead.\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 8)):** Safe. (8, 8) is currently empty. This is a common path to escape.\n3.  **UP/RIGHT:** Off board/Body collision. NO.\n\n**Scenario 1: He moves LEFT (to (7, 9))**\n*   We move to (4, 9).\n*   No collision risk whatsoever. He eats another apple, bringing the score to 7-10. We MUST counter immediately.\n\n**Scenario 2: He moves DOWN (to (8, 8))**\n*   We move to (4, 9).\n*   No collision risk. He is now trying to escape our wall by dropping into the next tier.\n\n**Collision Check at (7, 9) Apple:**\nWe are moving to (4, 9). He is likely moving to (7, 9). There is no head-on collision risk on this turn.\n\nWe are taking the apple at (4, 9) and preparing the next phase of the board domination!\n\n---\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T15-T17): The Top-Edge Domination**\nWe must continue along the Y=9 row to prevent Snake #1 from moving into the center from the north.\n\n1.  **T15 (At (4, 9)):** Move RIGHT to (5, 9) (next apple!). Score 8-10. Length 9.\n2.  **T16 (At (5, 9)):** Move RIGHT to (6, 9) (next apple!). Score 9-10. Length 10.\n3.  **T17 (At (6, 9)):** We will be right next to (7, 9) where he likely just moved. At this point, we will have a massive wall protecting the entire top half of the board. We will then evaluate if we can pin him against the edge (wall/body/wall) or if we need to drop DOWN to cut off his escape path further. We need to maintain our lead on the top row! If he drops down, we will consider either chasing (7, 9) or dropping (6, 8) to maintain the choke.\n\nWe need this apple, CHAT! Let's get this!\n\nRIGHT",
