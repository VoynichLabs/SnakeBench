The enemy snake is at (4,5). \n\nFirst, I need to plan my move. The last move was UP, which took me from (5,7) to (5,6), I think? Wait, no, because if I moved up from (5,7), the new head would be (5,8), right? Because increasing y is up. Wait, the previous position was (5,7), and after moving up, I would be at (5,8). But wait, looking at the board state, in row 7 (which is y=7), there's the snake's head at (5,7). Then after moving up, I should check if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the last move was UP. So the previous head was (5,7), moving up to (5,8). But in the current board state, at (5,8) there's no apple. Let me check the coordinates again. The apple positions are (0,0), (9,2), (2,8), (1,1), (7,9). So (5,8) isn't an apple. So moving up from (5,7) to (5,8) is safe, but maybe not the best move.\n\nNow, the goal is to collect apples to grow and get points. I need to find the closest apple to my current position. Let's see. Current head is at (5,7). The apples are:\n\n(0,0) - bottom left, y=0.\n\n(9,2) - top right x=9, y=2.\n\n(2,8) - high y=8, x=2.\n\n(1,1) - y=1.\n\n(7,9) - highest y=9, x=7.\n\nLooking at these, the closest apple would probably be (7,9) since I'm at (5,7). Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (5,7) to (7,9) is (7-5) + (9-7) = 2 + 2 = 4. Another",

The board is 10x10, so coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. \n\nFirst, I should check the apples. The apples are at (0,0), (9,2), (2,8), (1,1), and (7,9). The snake's goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (4,1) with no body. So, the main danger is hitting that enemy or the walls. Also, since my snake is alone now, I need to avoid hitting myself once I start growing.\n\nLooking at the last move, I moved DOWN, which from (8,6) would take me to (8,5). Wait, but the board's y-axis increases upwards. So moving DOWN would decrease y by 1. So from (8,6), moving down would be (8,5). But in the board layout, the rows are listed from 9 (top) down to 0 (bottom). Wait, the board is displayed with 9 at the top and 0 at the bottom. So moving up increases y, moving down decreases y. So the head is currently at (8,6). If I move down, that would be (8,5). But in the previous move, the rationale was a random DOWN move. So the snake's head is now at (8,5) after moving down from (8,6). \n\nWait, but the current position after the last move is (8,5), right? Because the last move was DOWN. So the current head is (8,5). But maybe I should confirm. The board state shows the snake's head at (8,6) in the last move's board state. Wait, no. The board state is the state before the last move. Because the last move was a DOWN. So if the head was at (8,6) before the move, moving DOWN would take it to (8,5). So the current position is (8,5) now.\n\nSo the current coordinates of the snake's head are (8,5). Now, I need to decide the next move. Let's check possible directions:\n\nUp: (",

The goal is to collect apples and avoid dying by hitting walls, enemies, or itself.\n\nFirst, let's look at the apples. The apples are at (0,0), (9,2), (2,8), (1,1), (7,9). The nearest ones to the current position (8,5) would be (9,2) and (7,9). Let me calculate the distances. \n\nFrom (8,5) to (9,2): x difference is 1, y difference is 3 (since 5-2=3). Total steps would be 1+3=4 if moving in a straight line, but since we can move one step at a time, maybe we can plan a path. Similarly, (7,9) is 1 unit left and 4 up. That's 5 steps. \n\nBut there's also the enemy snake at (4,0) with no body. Need to avoid that. Also, after collecting an apple, the snake grows, so need to plan paths that don't lead into future positions.\n\nThe current direction was DOWN (from 6 to 5). The direction could be changed. Let's see possible moves:\n\nIf we go UP, from (8,5) to (8,6). Then check if that's safe. The previous positions were (8,6) before moving down, but after that, the head is now at (8,5). Moving back up would go to (8,6), which was the previous position. But since the snake's body is empty, maybe that's allowed? Wait, rule 2 says if you run into yourself (go backwards), you die. So moving back into the previous position would be hitting yourself. Because the snake's body is the previous positions except the head. Wait, in a snake game, the body is the path the snake has taken. So when the snake moves, the head moves, and the body follows. But in this case, the snake has no body, so if it moves back to the previous position, would that be considered hitting itself? Because the previous position is part of the snake's body? Or since there's no body",

The first move was DOWN to (8,6), but that was a random move. Now I need to decide the next move.\n\nFirst, I should look at where the apples are. The apples are at (0,0), (9,2), (2,8), (1,1), and (7,9). My current position is (8,7). Let me plot these apples on the board. The closest apple to me might be (7,9), which is two units up and one unit right. But since moving up from (8,7) would take me to (8,8), which is closer to (7,9) than other apples. Alternatively, maybe (2,8) is another target, but that's further away.\n\nWait, the apples are at (0,0) (bottom left), (9,2) (top right), (2,8) (mid-top), (1,1) (near bottom left), and (7,9) (top). My current position is (8,7), which is in the lower right area. The closest apple would be (7,9) which is two up and one left. But from (8,7), moving up would take me to (8,8), then maybe left to (7,8), but that's not an apple. Alternatively, maybe (2,8) is another apple. Let me calculate distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): Manhattan distance is |8-7| + |7-9| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nDistance to (2,8): |8-2| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7.\nDistance to (9,2): that's way far, so probably not.\nDistance to (0,0): 8+7=15. (1,1) is 7+6=13. So (7,9) is the closest.\n\nSo moving towards (7,9) makes sense. From (8,7), moving up (y increases) to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9",
