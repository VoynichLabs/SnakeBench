It moves me one step closer to the goal apple at (9,1) and maintains a safe spatial distance from the envious adversary's position, creating room for a more favorable position next round.\n\nNext turn reminder: Don't jump for the apple prematurely while the enemy is nearby; instead, continue moving right to approach the apple while keeping safety in mind and existing spatial advantages.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",
