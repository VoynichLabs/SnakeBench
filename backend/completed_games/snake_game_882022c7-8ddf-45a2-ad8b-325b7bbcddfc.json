All safe from direct collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (1,6) directly above me. Eating it grows me to length 5.  \nAfter that, (4,8) and (4,9) are nearby in the top-left area.  \nEnemy is at (5,7), close to (4,8) and (4,9).  \n\nUP gives immediate apple and growth, but puts me at (1,6) next to enemy\u2019s possible path toward those apples.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (1,6) apple: new head at (1,6), body will be [(1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3)]. From (1,6) next turn, possible moves: UP (1,7), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6), DOWN (1,5) body \u2192 3 safe moves, but UP (1,7) is near enemy\u2019s area.  \n- LEFT to (0,5): from there moves: UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), RIGHT (1,5) body \u2192 2 safe moves, near edge.  \n- RIGHT to (2,5): from there moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4) body, LEFT (1,5) body, RIGHT (3,5) \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nUP gives best immediate reward and more future options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration:**  \nEnemy at (5,7) might go UP toward (4,8)/(4,9) or LEFT to (4,7). If I go UP to (1,6), I\u2019m still far from enemy\u2019s immediate path. But next turn, if I go UP again to (1,7), I could be closer to enemy if it moves toward (4,8). Still safe for now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nEat (1,6) now, then consider moving toward (4,8) via (2,6), (3,6), etc., but watch enemy\u2019s movement. If enemy goes for (4,8), I could aim for (4,9) or retreat to lower apples (7,1) later. Avoid being trapped in top-left corner.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP to eat apple, grow, and keep options open.  \n\nUP",

All safe from direct collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to me is (4,1) at distance 5 (\u0394x=1, \u0394y=5).  \nBut (8,4) is closer in Manhattan distance (\u0394x=5, \u0394y=2) = 7 vs (4,1) = 6? Let\u2019s compute:  \n(3,6) to (4,1): |3-4|+|6-1| = 1+5=6.  \n(3,6) to (8,4): |3-8|+|6-4| = 5+2=7.  \nSo (4,1) is slightly closer.  \nBut (4,1) is near my tail area (my tail is at (1,4)), so moving toward it could box me in.  \n(8,4) is more open, and (7,1) and (9,1) are further right.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (3,7): from there moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6) body, LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (3,5): from there moves: UP (3,6) body, DOWN (3,4), LEFT (2,5), RIGHT (4,5) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (4,6): from there moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6) body, RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three keep good options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration:**  \nEnemy is at top edge, will likely move left or right along top row next turn.  \nIf I go UP, I move closer to enemy\u2019s area, which is risky long-term.  \nIf I go DOWN, I move toward bottom apples (4,1) and (3,0) and away from enemy.  \nIf I go RIGHT, I move toward central-right apples (8,4) and away from enemy.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy is longer now (5 vs my 5). Avoid confrontation. Head toward bottom/right apples while keeping space. My tail will move in a few turns, opening up left side.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP moves toward enemy, not ideal.  \nDOWN moves toward (4,1) but my own body is near there; after moving to (3,5), next turn I could go DOWN to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,5) \u2013 both safe.  \nRIGHT moves toward (8,4) and opens more central space.  \n\nI prefer RIGHT to progress toward right-side apples while staying clear of enemy\u2019s top area.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (8,4) via safe path, maybe down later to avoid top enemy. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible descent.  \n\nRIGHT",

Currently no apple eaten, so tail moves forward along body path.  \nIf I go LEFT to (3,5), I\u2019m near my body\u2019s old positions (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) which will shift but could box me in bottom-left if not careful.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy likely wants apples too. Closest apple to enemy:  \nFrom (6,9) to apples: (8,4) dist 7, (7,1) dist 9, (9,1) dist 9, (3,0) dist 12, (4,1) dist 10.  \nSo (8,4) is closest to enemy. That\u2019s near my area if I go RIGHT.  \nIf I go RIGHT toward (5,5), I move toward (8,4) but so might enemy from above \u2014 possible future collision risk.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN:  \n- Gets me closer to closest apple (4,1)  \n- Keeps 3 safe moves next turn  \n- Moves away from enemy\u2019s likely path to (8,4)  \n- Avoids boxing myself in left side  \n\nLEFT is riskier (only 2 safe moves next).  \nRIGHT moves toward enemy\u2019s target apple, increasing risk later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove down toward (4,1), but watch for enemy possibly coming down later. Keep tail movement in mind to avoid boxing myself in bottom-left.  \n\nDOWN",

Closest apple is (8, 4) (dist 6). Enemy might move DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT this turn, but to reach (8, 4) they\u2019d likely go RIGHT then DOWN over several turns.  \nIf I go RIGHT toward (5, 4), I\u2019m moving toward the same apple (8, 4) but from the left side. Could lead to future head-on risk if we meet at (8, 4) in a few turns.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tail movement and space**  \nMy tail is at (2, 6). I haven\u2019t eaten an apple, so next turn tail moves to (4, 6)? Wait, trace body: head (4, 4), then (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6).  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 3), body becomes: head (4, 3), then (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6) \u2014 tail at (3, 6).  \nSo tail moves forward, freeing (2, 6).

My possible destinations: (4, 2), (3, 3), (5, 3).  \nManhattan distances from enemy head to my possible destinations:  \n- (4, 2): dist 9  \n- (3, 3): dist 9  \n- (5, 3): dist 7  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple distances from my head (4, 3)**  \nApples: (9, 1), (7, 1), (3, 0), (8, 4), (4, 1)  \nManhattan distances:  \n- (4, 1): dist 2  \n- (3, 0): dist 4  \n- (7, 1): dist 5  \n- (8, 4): dist 5  \n- (9, 1): dist 9  \n\nClosest is (4, 1).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Path to (4, 1)**  \nFrom (4, 3):  \n- DOWN to (4, 2) \u2192 closer to (4, 1)  \n- LEFT to (3, 3) \u2192 farther from (4, 1) but closer to (3, 0)  \n- RIGHT to (5, 3) \u2192 farther from (4, 1) but closer to (8, 4) or (7, 1)  \n\nCheck future safe moves after each:  \n- DOWN to (4, 2): next moves: UP (4, 3) empty, DOWN (4, 1) apple, LEFT (3, 2) empty, RIGHT (5, 2) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (3, 3): next moves: UP (3, 4) empty, DOWN (3, 2) empty, LEFT (2, 3) empty, RIGHT (4, 3) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (5, 3): next moves: UP (5, 4) empty, DOWN (5, 2) empty, LEFT (4, 3) empty, RIGHT (6, 3) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\nAll keep good mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely apple target**  \nEnemy at (7, 8). Closest apple is (8, 4) (dist 5). Enemy might move DOWN or RIGHT to eventually go toward (8, 4). If I go RIGHT toward (5, 3), I\u2019m moving toward (8, 4) from the left, possibly leading to future conflict.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Tail movement and space**  \nMy tail is at (3, 6). I haven\u2019t eaten an apple last turn, so tail will move to (4, 6) this turn if I move DOWN? Wait, trace:  \nCurrent body: head (4, 3), then (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6).  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 2), new body: head (4, 2), then (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6) \u2014 tail at (4, 6).  \nSo tail moves from (3, 6) to (4, 6), freeing (3, 6).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Avoiding future traps**  \nMy body occupies vertical line at x=4 from y=2 to y=6 after moving DOWN. That\u2019s a long vertical segment, which could limit movement later. But I\u2019m heading to apple at (4, 1), so after eating it I\u2019ll grow and that vertical line will extend further. That might be risky later, but for now it\u2019s safe.  \n\nLEFT to (3, 3) gives more space away from my own body cluster.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gets me to apple (4, 1) in two moves, but creates a long vertical body that might box me in later.  \nLEFT keeps me flexible and moves toward apple (3, 0) as backup.  \nRIGHT moves toward enemy\u2019s target apple (8, 4), increasing future conflict risk.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away, I can afford to go LEFT for better board positioning and still have apples nearby.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove LEFT to (3, 3), then likely DOWN to (3, 2) toward apple (3, 0) or (4, 1) depending on enemy movement. Keep space open, avoid boxing myself with my long body.  \n\nLEFT",

My possible destinations: (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2).  \nManhattan distances from enemy head to my possible destinations:  \n- (3, 1): dist 11  \n- (2, 2): dist 11  \n- (4, 2): dist 9  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple distances from my head (3, 2)**  \nApples: (9, 1), (7, 1), (3, 0), (8, 4), (4, 1)  \nManhattan distances:  \n- (3, 0): dist 2  \n- (4, 1): dist 2  \n- (7, 1): dist 5  \n- (8, 4): dist 7  \n- (9, 1): dist 9  \n\nClosest are (3, 0) and (4, 1).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Path to closest apples**  \n- DOWN to (3, 1) \u2192 next turn can go DOWN to (3, 0) for apple.  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) \u2192 farther from both closest apples.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2192 next turn can go DOWN to (4, 1) for apple.  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to an apple in 2 moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (3, 1)**:  \n   Next moves from (3, 1):  \n   - UP (3, 2) \u2192 empty (my old head position)  \n   - DOWN (3, 0) \u2192 apple  \n   - LEFT (2, 1) \u2192 empty  \n   - RIGHT (4, 1) \u2192 apple (but could be risky if enemy moves there? enemy far)  \n   All 4 moves safe next turn \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n2. **RIGHT to (4, 2)**:  \n   Next moves from (4, 2):  \n   - UP (4, 3) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid  \n   - DOWN (4, 1) \u2192 apple  \n   - LEFT (3, 2) \u2192 empty  \n   - RIGHT (5, 2) \u2192 empty  \n   3 safe moves \u2192 slightly worse mobility.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 2)**:  \n   Next moves from (2, 2):  \n   - UP (2, 3) \u2192 empty  \n   - DOWN (2, 1) \u2192 empty  \n   - LEFT (1, 2) \u2192 empty  \n   - RIGHT (3, 2) \u2192 empty  \n   All 4 safe \u2192 good mobility but farther from apples.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Body shape and tail movement**  \nMy tail is at (4, 5). Last turn I moved DOWN, so tail will move to (4, 4) this turn, freeing (4, 5).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 2), I\u2019m moving toward my own body column (x=4) but not into it yet; next turn UP would be blocked by body at (4, 3). That\u2019s a slight constraint.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely target**  \nEnemy at (8, 7), closest apple is (8, 4) (dist 3) and (7, 1) (dist 7). Enemy might move DOWN toward (8, 4). That\u2019s far from me.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gets me to (3, 1) with full mobility next turn and apple (3, 0) one move away.  \nRIGHT gets me to (4, 2) with slightly less mobility and apple (4, 1) one move away.  \nLEFT delays apple collection.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, DOWN gives better mobility next turn and keeps me away from my body cluster at x=4.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (3, 1), then DOWN to (3, 0) to grab apple, then reassess.  \n\nDOWN",

Eating it gives me apple lead (8 vs 7) and grows my length to 9.  \nEnemy might eat (7, 1) if they go LEFT, tying apples again if I don\u2019t eat mine. So I should grab mine now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (1, 3) \u2192 after eating apple, my body will be: head (1, 3), then old head (1, 2) added to front of body? Wait, growth means new head at apple, old body stays, tail stays same length? Actually: Snake grows by 1 segment when eating apple \u2014 so new head at apple, old head becomes new second segment, tail doesn\u2019t move. So next turn my body will be: head (1, 3), then (1, 2), then (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1) \u2014 length 9.  \nFrom (1, 3) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (1, 4) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 2) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) empty.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn after eating apple at (1, 3). That\u2019s risky.\n\n- DOWN to (1, 1):  \nFrom (1, 1) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (1, 2) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 0) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 very dangerous.\n\n- LEFT to (0, 2):  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (0, 3) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (0, 1) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (1, 2) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Compare:**  \nUP: gets apple lead but only 2 safe moves next turn (UP or RIGHT from (1, 3)).  \nLEFT: no apple now, but 2 safe moves next turn (UP or DOWN from (0, 2)).  \nDOWN: only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 avoid.\n\nUP is tempting for apple, but could trap me if not careful. However, enemy is far away, so even with only 2 moves next turn, I might survive if I plan.  \nLEFT delays apple but keeps options.\n\nGiven scores are tied, gaining apple lead is important, but staying alive is more important. Let\u2019s check if UP is truly safe next turn:  \nFrom (1, 3), if I go UP to (1, 4) next turn, that\u2019s safe. If I go RIGHT to (2, 3), that\u2019s safe. So I\u2019d survive next turn. The risk is the turn after that \u2014 but I can adjust.\n\nAlso, if enemy eats (7, 1), they grow to length 9 too, so still tied if I don\u2019t eat mine. So I should eat mine.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gets apple, gives lead, and next turn is manageable.  \nLEFT avoids apple but safer long-term? Actually, LEFT gives same number of safe moves next turn (2) as UP, but no apple. So UP is strictly better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 3), choose between UP to (1, 4) or RIGHT to (2, 3) depending on board. Aim to then go toward (1, 5) or (4, 7) while avoiding boxing myself in.\n\nUP",

After securing these, evaluate the board state - consider moving toward (4,7) or other available apples while maintaining distance from the enemy. Keep monitoring the enemy's movement pattern to avoid potential conflicts.\n\nUP",

The enemy is concentrated on the left side, so staying on the right side remains safer.

          "rationale": "Let me analyze the current state after my last move.\n\n**Current Position:**\n- My head is now at (8,7) after moving RIGHT from (7,7)\n- My body: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)] - I just ate the apple at (8,7) so I should have grown, but the body hasn't updated yet (since this is the state at the start of turn 34). Actually, I need to be careful: the board state shows me at (8,7) with my body segments. I now have 11 apples (was 10, just collected one).\n\n**Apples available:** (0,9), (5,4), (5,5), (8,0), (1,9) - note (8,7) is gone now.\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (4,7), body: [(3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)], apples: 11\n\n**Available moves from (8,7):**\n- UP: (8,8) - empty, safe\n- DOWN: (8,6) - empty, safe\n- LEFT: (7,7) - contains my own body (the segment just behind my head) \u274c would kill me\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - empty, safe\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- I just collected an apple and tied the score (both at 11 apples now).\n- Important apples: (8,0) is below me, (5,4) and (5,5) are to the left, (0,9) and (1,9) are far top-left.\n- Enemy is at (4,7) and might be heading toward (5,4) or (5,5) apples.\n- DOWN leads toward (8,0) apple - this is close and valuable.\n- RIGHT leads to (9,7) which is safe but not directly toward apples.\n- UP leads to (8,8) which is safe but away from immediate apples.\n\n**Future safety:**\n- Moving DOWN to (8,6) gives me options: LEFT to (7,6) (but that's my body? Actually, next turn my body will shift so (7,6) might become free? But careful: if I move DOWN, my head goes to (8,6), and my body becomes [ (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), ... ] so (7,6) is occupied by my body. So from (8,6), safe moves would be DOWN to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,6), or LEFT to (7,6) which is my body? Wait no: after moving, the tail moves? Actually, since I just ate an apple, I grow by one, so the tail doesn't move. So my body will be 11 segments long. So if I go DOWN to (8,6), my body will be: [ (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), ... ] so (7,6) is occupied. So from (8,6), LEFT to (7,6) is not safe. So DOWN gives me DOWN and RIGHT as safe next moves.\n- Similarly, RIGHT to (9,7) gives future options: UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), LEFT to (8,7) (but that will be my body). So only UP and DOWN from there.\n- UP to (8,8) gives options: LEFT to (7,8), RIGHT to (9,8), DOWN to (8,7) (my body). So UP gives two safe options.\n\nBut the most promising is DOWN to get the apple at (8,0) which is straight down. From (8,6), I can continue DOWN to (8,5), (8,4), etc., all the way to (8,0). This path seems clear and safe.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\n- Enemy at (4,7) might move toward me? But unlikely immediately. They might go for (5,4) or (5,5). So I should secure (8,0) quickly.\n\n**Best move:** DOWN to start moving toward the apple at (8,0).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Head down to collect (8,0), then consider moving left toward the center apples (5,4) and (5,5) if safe. Avoid enemy head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, I just grew to 11 segments? Actually, I collected an apple last turn (at (8,7)), so now I have 11 apples and my body length is 11. The board shows my head at (8,6) and body segments at (8,7), (7,7), etc. So my full body is: head (8,6), then (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1) \u2014 that's 11 segments. The tail is at (9,1).\n\n**Apples available:** (0,9), (5,4), (5,5), (8,0), (1,9)\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (5,7), body: [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)] \u2014 11 segments.\n\n**Available moves from (8,6):**\n- UP: (8,7) \u2014 occupied by my own body (the segment directly behind my head) \u274c would kill me.\n- DOWN: (8,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (7,6) \u2014 occupied by my own body (segment from previous turn) \u274c would kill me.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- DOWN leads to (8,5), which is closer to the apple at (8,0). This is a direct path downward. From (8,5), I can continue DOWN to (8,4), etc., all the way to (8,0). This is very promising.\n- RIGHT leads to (9,6). This is safe but doesn't get me closer to any immediate apple. From (9,6), I could go DOWN to (9,5) or UP to (9,7), but both are away from apples. The apple at (8,0) is below, and the others are left.\n- The enemy is at (5,7) and might be heading toward the apples at (5,4) or (5,5). I should avoid going left into that area for now.\n- Moving DOWN is optimal to secure the apple at (8,0). This will give me 12 apples, tying with the enemy (who has 11? Wait, scores: I have 11 apples now (just collected one), enemy has 11. So if I get (8,0), I'll be at 12, leading by one.\n\n**Future safety:**\n- After moving DOWN to (8,5), my body will be: [ (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), ... ] so (8,6) and (8,7) are occupied. From (8,5), safe moves would be DOWN to (8,4) and RIGHT to (9,5). LEFT to (7,5) is my body? Actually, (7,5) is a body segment (from the list). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. But DOWN continues the path to the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,6) gives future options: DOWN to (9,5) or UP to (9,7). Both are safe but not toward apples.\n\nSo DOWN is clearly better.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving DOWN to collect (8,0). After that, consider moving left toward (5,4) or (5,5) if safe, but be cautious of the enemy. Alternatively, after (8,0), I might go to (7,0) and then up, but need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nDOWN",

Actually, I have 11 segments (10 apples collected + initial length). The board shows my head at (8,5) and body segments at (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), etc. So my full body is: head (8,5), then (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1). The tail is at (8,1).\n\n**Apples available:** (0,9), (5,4), (5,5), (8,0), (1,9)\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (5,6), body: [(5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\n**Available moves from (8,5):**\n- UP: (8,6) \u2014 occupied by my own body (directly behind my head) \u274c would kill me.\n- DOWN: (8,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (7,5) \u2014 occupied by my own body \u274c would kill me.\n- RIGHT: (9,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- DOWN leads to (8,4), which is directly toward the apple at (8,0). This is a clear path: DOWN to (8,4), then (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0). Note that (8,1) is currently my tail, but by the time I get there, it will have moved (since I'm moving forward). So this is safe and efficient.\n- RIGHT leads to (9,5). This is safe but doesn't get me closer to any immediate apple. From (9,5), I could go DOWN to (9,4) or UP to (9,6), but both are away from apples. The nearest apple is (8,0) below, and others are to the left.\n- The enemy is at (5,6) and might be heading toward (5,4) or (5,5). I should avoid going left into that area for now.\n- Moving DOWN is optimal to secure the apple at (8,0). This will give me 12 apples, surpassing the enemy (who has 11).\n\n**Future safety after DOWN to (8,4):**\n- My body will be: [ (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), ... ] so (8,5) and (8,6) are occupied. From (8,4), safe moves would be DOWN to (8,3) and RIGHT to (9,4). LEFT to (7,4) is my body? Actually, (7,4) is a body segment (from the list). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. DOWN continues the path to the apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving DOWN to collect (8,0). After that, consider moving left toward (5,4) or (5,5) if safe, but be cautious of the enemy. Alternatively, after (8,0), I might go to (7,0) and then up, but need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nDOWN is the best choice.\n\nDOWN",

Actually, the apples are (0,9), (8,0), (1,9), (2,3), (6,1). So (5,4) is not an apple; perhaps it was collected or I misread earlier.\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (5,4), body: [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] \u2014 13 segments.\n\n**Available moves from (8,3):**\n- UP: (8,4) \u2014 occupied by my own body (directly behind my head) \u274c would kill me.\n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2014 occupied by my own body \u274c would kill me.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- DOWN to (8,2): This continues my path toward the apple at (8,0). After (8,2), I can go to (8,1) and then (8,0) to collect the apple. This is efficient and safe. My tail is at (7,2), which will move away when I advance, so (8,2) will be free next turn.\n- RIGHT to (9,3): This moves me away from the apple at (8,0) and doesn't lead directly to any other apple. From (9,3), I could go DOWN to (9,2) or UP to (9,4), but both are not toward apples. The nearest apples are (8,0) below and (6,1) to the left, so RIGHT is suboptimal.\n- The enemy is at (5,4) and might be heading toward (2,3) or (1,9) or (6,1). I should avoid going left into that area until necessary.\n- Moving DOWN is clearly the best choice to secure the apple at (8,0). This will give me 11 apples (still behind enemy's 13), but I can catch up.\n\n**Future safety after DOWN to (8,2):**\n- My body will be: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), ...] so (8,3) and (8,4) are occupied. From (8,2), safe moves would be DOWN to (8,1) and RIGHT to (9,2). LEFT to (7,2) is my tail? Actually, my tail is at (7,2) now, but when I move, the tail will move to (7,3)? Wait, no: when I move to (8,2), the head moves, and the body shifts: the tail (currently at (7,2)) will move to the next segment? Actually, the entire body moves: the head goes to (8,2), and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail (currently at (7,2)) will be removed if I don't eat an apple? But I am not eating an apple this turn, so I will not grow. Therefore, the tail will move: the segment at (7,2) will be removed, and the new tail will be at (7,3)? Wait, let's trace:\n\nCurrent body: head (8,3), then segments at (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2) [tail].\nAfter moving DOWN to (8,2):\n- New head: (8,2)\n- Body becomes: [ (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3) ] \u2014 tail is at (7,3). So (7,2) is freed.\n\nTherefore, from (8,2), the adjacent cells:\n- UP: (8,3) \u2014 my body (occupied)\n- DOWN: (8,1) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT: (7,2) \u2014 empty (since tail moved)\n- RIGHT: (9,2) \u2014 empty\n\nSo all three directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) will be safe next turn except UP. This gives me flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (8,2)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (8,1) (to get closer to apple at (8,0))\n- Then DOWN to (8,0) to collect the apple. After that, I will grow to length 12.\n- After collecting (8,0), I should consider moving left toward (6,1) or (2,3), but be cautious of the enemy. Alternatively, I could go to (7,0) and then up, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nDOWN is the best move to secure the apple and maintain future options.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- DOWN to (8,0): This collects the apple at (8,0). This is efficient and grows me to length 12 (still behind enemy's 13). After eating, my head will be at (8,0), and my body will extend so the tail doesn't move this turn. This is safe and directly gains an apple.\n- LEFT to (7,1): Moves me away from the apple at (8,0) but toward the apple at (6,1). However, it doesn't collect an apple immediately.\n- RIGHT to (9,1): Moves me to the edge, away from apples. From there, I could go DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1), but both are not optimal for apples.\n\nThe best move is DOWN to (8,0) to secure the apple. This is low-risk and progresses my score.\n\n**Future safety after DOWN to (8,0):**\nAfter moving DOWN to (8,0) and eating the apple, my head will be at (8,0), and I grow by 1. My body becomes: [ (8,0) (head), (8,1), (8,2), ..., (7,4) ] with length 12. The tail remains at (7,4) this turn (since I ate). Adjacent cells from (8,0):\n- UP: (8,1) \u2014 my body (occupied)\n- DOWN: off board \u274c invalid\n- LEFT: (7,0) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT: (9,0) \u2014 empty\n\nSo next turn, only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. This is a bit limiting, but I can plan from there. For example, going LEFT to (7,0) would be safe and then I can go UP to (7,1) to approach (6,1) apple. Alternatively, RIGHT to (9,0) is safe but leads to a corner.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (8,0) to collect the apple.\n- Next turn: From (8,0), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Prefer LEFT to (7,0) to avoid the corner and have more options (from (7,0), I can go UP to (7,1) which is near (6,1) apple).\n- After that, target the apple at (6,1) or (2,3), but be cautious of the enemy.\n\nDOWN is the best move to secure the apple and grow. The temporary reduction in options at (8,0) is acceptable since I can escape via LEFT next turn.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate head-on collision risk.  \nMy tail is at (1,3) \u2014 moving DOWN or RIGHT keeps distance.  \nLEFT moves me closer to my long vertical body column, which could trap me later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have a 3-apple lead. Playing safe and keeping mobility high is wise.  \nRIGHT to (6,2) gives me 3 safe moves next turn and sets up apple (6,1) for next turn.  \nDOWN to (5,1) also gives 3 safe moves and sets up apple (6,1) next turn.  \nRIGHT is slightly better because from (6,2) I can also go UP to (6,3) to explore more open space near center, whereas from (5,1) I\u2019m near bottom edge.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",

From (7,0), next moves could be UP to (7,1) (which is safe and near (6,1)) or LEFT to (6,0) (which is also safe).\n- RIGHT to (9,0): This moves me to the corner. From (9,0), only UP to (9,1) is safe (since LEFT is (8,0) which will be my body after moving). This is very limiting and risky for future moves.\n\nClearly, LEFT is better to avoid the corner and maintain flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: LEFT to (7,0) to avoid the corner.\n- Next turn: From (7,0), I can go UP to (7,1) to approach the apple at (6,1). Alternatively, LEFT to (6,0) is also safe and moves toward (3,0) apple.\n- Target apples: (6,1) is close, and (3,0) is also reachable. (0,9) and (1,9) are far and might be contested by enemy.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy head at (6,2). It might move toward (6,1) apple? Possible moves from (6,2): UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2) (its own body?), RIGHT to (7,2) (empty). So it might go DOWN to (6,1) to get the apple. I should be cautious.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,0) now, then next turn UP to (7,1), I can be near (6,1). But if enemy goes DOWN to (6,1) same turn, we might collide? Actually, if I go to (7,1) and enemy goes to (6,1), we are adjacent, not same cell. But if I then try to go LEFT to (6,1) later, enemy might be there.\n\nBetter to avoid direct conflict since enemy is longer (13 vs my 12). Instead, consider going for (3,0) apple which is safer.\n\nAfter LEFT to (7,0), next turn I can go LEFT to (6,0) (safe) and then DOWN to (6,-1)? No, DOWN from (6,0) is off board. So from (6,0), only UP to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,0). So to get (3,0), I need to go left along the bottom row.\n\nActually, (3,0) is at bottom row. So from (7,0), going LEFT to (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0) to eat it. This path is safe as long as no enemy blocks.\n\nEnemy is at (6,2), so it might not go to bottom row immediately.\n\nSo plan: \n- This turn: LEFT to (7,0)\n- Next turn: LEFT to (6,0)\n- Then LEFT to (5,0), (4,0), (3,0) to eat the apple at (3,0).\n\nThis is a safe path to collect an apple without risking collision with enemy.\n\nLEFT is the best move to start this path.\n\nLEFT",

However, board still has open areas.  \nUP or RIGHT avoid growth but reduce safe moves next turn.  \n\nGiven my lead, maybe I should play safe and keep mobility high.  \nDOWN \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, eat apple, lead increases.  \nUP \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, no apple.  \nRIGHT \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, no apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating (6,1), I\u2019ll be at (6,1) with body extending back. Next turn I can go DOWN to (6,0) or LEFT to (5,1) to move toward bottom-left apples (3,0) or (2,3). Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s area (right side) until necessary.

So it might not choose the risky move.\n\nHowever, since enemy is longer (14 vs my 12), I should avoid direct conflict. The safest path is to continue toward (3,0) along the bottom row, but I need to be cautious.\n\nActually, from (6,0), if enemy moves DOWN to (6,0), we collide.

From (5,0), I can continue left to (4,0), (3,0) to eat the apple safely.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy head at (5,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (5,2) - its own body \u274c\n- DOWN: (5,0) - empty (if I move LEFT to (5,0), we might collide)\n- LEFT: (4,1) - empty\n- RIGHT: (6,1) - its own body \u274c\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN to (5,0) or LEFT to (4,1). If I go LEFT to (5,0), there's a chance enemy moves DOWN to (5,0) same turn, causing a head-on collision (both die). This is dangerous.\n\nHowever, enemy might choose LEFT to (4,1) to avoid collision and move toward the apple at (2,3) or (3,1). Since enemy has more apples (14 vs my 11), it might avoid risky moves.\n\nBut to be safe, I have no other options: only LEFT is available. So I must take it and hope enemy doesn't choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Continue left along bottom row to (3,0) apple. This is safe as long as enemy doesn't block.\n- After eating (3,0), consider moving up to (3,1) apple if still available.\n- Avoid enemy head; try to stay on bottom row where enemy is less likely to go.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s very risky.  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,1), enemy\u2019s only safe move is (5,0), which is not (4,1) \u2192 safe.\n\nSo LEFT avoids possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple positions:**  \nApples: (0,9), (1,9), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1)  \nFrom (4,1):  \n- Closest apple is (3,1) distance 2, (3,0) distance 3.  \nFrom (5,0):  \n- Closest apple is (3,0) distance 2, (3,1) distance 3.  \n\nBoth moves get me closer to some apples, but DOWN risks death.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nLEFT to (4,1):  \nNext turn from (4,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,2) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,0) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,1) apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, one leads to apple.\n\nDOWN to (5,0):  \nNext turn from (5,0) if I survive collision:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,0) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,0) enemy\u2019s old head (empty next turn) \u2192 possibly safe.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn, and one is risky if enemy lingers.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nI have a lead (14 vs 11 apples). Avoid head-on collisions. Move toward bottom-left apples (3,1) and (3,0) safely. After LEFT to (4,1), next turn I can go LEFT to (3,1) to eat apple and grow, or go UP/DOWN to keep options open. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s territory (right side) unless necessary.\n\nGiven the collision risk with DOWN, LEFT is clearly safer and maintains good future options.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

That\u2019s fatal.  \nIf I go LEFT to (3,1), enemy goes to (4,0) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (4,2), enemy goes to (4,0) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo DOWN is dangerous and should be eliminated.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple positions**  \nApples: (0,9), (1,9), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1)  \nFrom my head:  \n- LEFT (3,1) \u2192 apple immediately.  \n- UP (4,2) \u2192 no apple, but closer to (2,3) maybe later.  \n- DOWN (4,0) \u2192 closer to (3,0) but collision risk.  \n\nEating apple at (3,1) grows me, adds 1 apple, and is safe.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \nLEFT to (3,1) (eat apple):  \nNext turn head at (3,1), body longer by 1 segment at old head (4,1).  \nFrom (3,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,2) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,0) apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1) my new body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves, one leads to another apple (3,0). Good.\n\nUP to (4,2):  \nFrom (4,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,3) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves, no immediate apple but more open space above.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term considerations**  \nI have a lead (14 vs 11 apples). Eating (3,1) extends lead to 15, and next turn I can eat (3,0) if safe. Enemy is stuck near bottom left after moving to (4,0), possibly heading for (3,0) next turn too. If I eat (3,1) now, I block enemy from (3,1) and can compete for (3,0) next turn.\n\nIf I go UP, I avoid immediate apple but stay flexible. However, enemy might eat (3,1) or (3,0) soon, reducing my lead advantage. Safer to grab apple now while collision-free.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is eliminated (collision risk).  \nBetween LEFT (apple, 3 future moves) and UP (no apple, 2 future moves), LEFT is better for score and still safe.  \nLEFT also keeps me away from enemy\u2019s immediate path (enemy going to (4,0)).\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (3,1), check if (3,0) is safe to take next turn (enemy might be at (4,0) and could move to (3,0) same time \u2192 head-on risk). If risky, go UP or LEFT instead of DOWN to (3,0). Keep extending lead toward 30 apples.\n\nLEFT",

And empty (no snake body)\n- RIGHT: (5,0) - occupied by my own body \u274c would kill me\n\nSo only safe move: LEFT to (3,0) to eat the apple.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy head at (3,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (3,2) - empty\n- DOWN: (3,0) - empty (but I am moving there to eat the apple)\n- LEFT: (2,1) - empty\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - its own body \u274c\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If enemy moves DOWN to (3,0), we would have a head-on collision since I am moving LEFT to (3,0). This is risky.\n\nHowever, enemy has other options: UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1). Also, there is an apple at (2,3) nearby which might attract it away. Enemy might avoid DOWN because it sees the risk of collision? But since it is longer and has more apples, it might be cautious.\n\nBut I have no choice: only LEFT is safe for me. Moving LEFT to (3,0) gives me an apple and grows my snake. Even if enemy moves DOWN and we collide, both die. But enemy has more apples (15 vs my 11), so if both die, enemy wins. So I should hope enemy doesn't choose DOWN.\n\n**Why enemy might not choose DOWN:**\n- Enemy sees that DOWN leads to (3,0) which is an apple, but also potential collision with me.\n- Enemy might prefer UP or LEFT to avoid risk.\n- There is an apple at (2,3) which is closer to LEFT or UP moves.\n\n**After eating apple at (3,0):**\nMy head will be at (3,0) and I grow by one segment. Then next turn, I can move:\n- UP to (3,1) - but enemy head is currently at (3,1)? Actually after this turn, enemy moves too. So if enemy moves away, (3,1) might be free.\n- LEFT to (2,0) - empty\n- DOWN: off board \u274c\n- RIGHT: (4,0) - my own body (since I just left it) \u274c\n\nSo next turn, from (3,0), I can only go UP or LEFT. So I need to plan accordingly.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move LEFT to (3,0) to eat the apple. Hope enemy does not choose DOWN.\n- Next turn, if (3,1) is free (enemy moved away), go UP to (3,1) to eat another apple? But wait, apple at (3,1) is not listed? Apples are at (0,9), (1,9), (2,3), (3,0), (2,6). So (3,1) has no apple. So after (3,0), I should consider moving LEFT to (2,0) to avoid enemy and then up to (2,1), (2,2), etc. to reach apple at (2,3) or (2,6).\n- Alternatively, if enemy is still near, I might need to go left and then up carefully.\n\nGiven that only LEFT is safe, I must choose it.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s two turns from now, but need to think ahead:  \n\nActually, timeline:  \nTurn 46: I\u2019m at (3,2), enemy at (3,0).  \nTurn 46 moves: I go LEFT to (2,2), enemy goes LEFT to (2,0).  \nTurn 47: I\u2019m at (2,2), enemy at (2,0).  \nTurn 47 moves: If I go UP to (2,3) apple, enemy could go UP to (2,1) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nSo safe for next turn too.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term safety**  \n\nUP to (3,3) also fine, but then apple (2,3) is to my LEFT from (3,3), which is safe.  \nBut going LEFT now to (2,2) gets me adjacent to apple (2,3) and also away from enemy\u2019s possible path (enemy at bottom left).  \n\nGiven my lead (15 vs 12), I can play safe and grab nearest apple.  \n\nLEFT seems best: gets apple next turn, avoids risk of being near enemy\u2019s future path up from (2,0), and keeps options open after eating apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,2), take apple at (2,3) unless enemy surprises (unlikely given its limited moves).

It is very likely to go UP to (2,3) to eat the apple there. Alternatively, it might go DOWN to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,2).\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (2,3), it eats the apple and grows. If it moves DOWN to (2,1), it might be heading towards me? But that would be risky for it.\n\n**My plan:**\nI should avoid moving UP to (2,1) if there's a chance enemy moves DOWN to (2,1) this turn - that would cause a head-on collision and both die. Since enemy has more apples (15 vs my 12), I should avoid that.\n\nInstead, I should move LEFT to (1,0) to be safe. Then from (1,0), I can go UP to (1,1) next turn, and then towards the apple at (0,4) or (0,9). The apple at (0,4) is closer.\n\nMoving LEFT also avoids potential conflict with enemy.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (1,0) now.\n- Next turn, go UP to (1,1) if safe.\n- Then aim for apple at (0,4) at (0,4) - which is only 3 moves away: (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)? Wait, to reach (0,4) I need to go up: (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (0,4). Alternatively, go left from (1,0) to (0,0) and then up to (0,1), (0,2), etc. But (0,0) is bottom left, which might be a dead end? But there is an apple at (0,4) and (0,9).\n\nAlso, apple at (2,6) is above, but enemy might be there.\n\nSince enemy is longer and has more apples, I should focus on collecting apples safely without confrontation.\n\nFor this turn, LEFT is safer than UP because it avoids potential head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN.\n\nLEFT",

So DOWN is unsafe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Remaining safe moves after eliminating DOWN**  \n\nSafe: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options**  \n\nUP (2, 3): eats apple immediately, grows by 1, tail stays at (2, 7) for now.  \nFrom (2, 3) after eating:  \n- UP (2, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 2): my body (old head position) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (1, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nLEFT (1, 2): no apple.  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP (1, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, but farther from apples.  \n\nApple at (2, 3) is very close; eating it extends my lead (16 vs 12).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible next move after this turn**  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (2, 1) and I go UP to (2, 3), enemy\u2019s next turn from (2, 1) could be UP to (2, 2) (my old head position, empty then) or LEFT to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 1) (my body at (3, 1) still there). So enemy won\u2019t collide with me next turn if I\u2019m at (2, 3).  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1, 0), even less threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \n\nAfter eating (2, 3), I\u2019ll have head at (2, 3), body longer by 1, tail at (2, 7).  \nNext closest apple: (2, 6) is just 3 steps away vertically, but note my own body occupies (2, 7) above it, so moving up from (2, 3) to (2, 6) means going through (2, 4), (2, 5), then (2, 6) \u2014 but (2, 7) is my tail, which will move as I move unless I wait. Actually, if I go up each turn, tail will follow eventually, but need to check if path is clear.  \n\nBetter to eat (2, 3) now, then consider going left toward (0, 4) or up toward (2, 6) depending on tail movement.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \n\nUP gets apple, is safe from collision this turn, keeps good mobility next turn, and increases lead.  \nLEFT avoids apple, delays scoring, and gives enemy time to potentially block my path to apples.  \n\nGiven my lead, securing nearest apple is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 3), look at enemy position. Likely move UP to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 3) to start heading toward (0, 4) apple while avoiding boxing myself in top-left. Avoid moving right into my dense body area.  \n\nUP",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) - empty\n- DOWN: (2,2) - its own body \u274c\n- LEFT: (1,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,3) - empty? (from board state, (3,3) is empty - no snake body)\n\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. It might go UP towards (2,4) or RIGHT towards (3,3). There is an apple at (2,6) which is above, so UP might be attractive. Also, enemy might go LEFT to (1,3) to avoid my area.\n\n**My plan:**\nMoving UP to (1,1) would let me eat the apple there immediately. This is very tempting because it's right next to me. After eating, I grow to length 14.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,0) is safe but doesn't get me an apple immediately. From (0,0), I can go UP to (0,1) next turn, then towards (0,4) apple.\n\nHowever, UP to (1,1) is better because:\n- It gets me an apple now.\n- It doesn't risk head-on collision: enemy is at (2,3) and can't reach (1,1) in one move (it would need two moves: e.g., LEFT to (1,3) then DOWN to (1,2), but not (1,1)).\n- After eating at (1,1), I can consider next moves: from (1,1), I can go UP to (1,2), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). This keeps options open.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,0) is safe but less rewarding. Also, (0,0) is a corner, which might limit future moves.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), I should aim for the apple at (0,4) or (0,9). The enemy is longer (17 vs my 14 after this apple), so I need to collect apples quickly to catch up. Avoiding confrontation is key.\n\nFor this turn, UP is the best move to get the apple and grow.\n\nUP",

If I go LEFT to (1, 3), I\u2019m closer to that apple path but not in immediate danger.  \n\nActually, apple at (1, 1) is directly below (1, 3) \u2014 if enemy goes UP to (1, 1) this turn, next turn it could go UP to (1, 2), which is directly below me if I\u2019m at (1, 3). That could create a potential head-on risk next turn if I go DOWN then. But I can avoid that by not going DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \n\nI want to collect (0, 4) and (2, 6). From (2, 4), I can go UP to (2, 5) then (2, 6) for that apple, but note my tail is at (2, 7) above (2, 6) \u2014 so if I go up to (2, 6) before tail moves, I\u2019ll hit my own body at (2, 7) next turn if I go further up. Actually, tail moves as I move because I ate last turn, so after this move, tail will move from (2, 7) to next segment? Let\u2019s check: my body length is 16 + 1 from last apple = 17 segments. Head now at (2, 3), body includes (2, 2), (3, 2), \u2026, (2, 7) is tail. If I move UP to (2, 4), new head (2, 4), body grows by 1 from last apple, so tail stays at (2, 7) until I move again without eating. So (2, 7) remains occupied.  \n\nThus, path to (2, 6): (2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 (2, 6) is okay, but from (2, 6) next moves: UP to (2, 7) is my tail, which will move only after I move from (2, 6) if I don\u2019t eat an apple then. So I can go (2, 6) and then left/right, not up. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nBetter to go UP now to (2, 4), then UP to (2, 5), then eat (2, 6) on third move. Meanwhile, enemy may go for (1, 1) apple, but I\u2019m far ahead (16 vs 12).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \n\nUP gives best path toward (2, 6) apple, keeps 3 safe moves next turn, avoids boxing myself in right side. LEFT also okay but slightly slower to (2, 6). RIGHT reduces future options.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 4), consider going UP to (2, 5) to approach (2, 6) apple, but check enemy position first. If enemy is moving toward (1, 1), no direct threat. Keep moving toward apples while maintaining space.  \n\nUP",

(from board state, (2,1) is empty - no snake body)\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy head at (2,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,5) - empty? (from board, (2,5) is empty)\n- DOWN: (2,3) - its own body \u274c\n- LEFT: (1,4) - empty\n- RIGHT: (3,4) - empty\n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. There is an apple at (2,6) which is above, so UP might be attractive. Also, enemy might go LEFT to (1,4) to approach my area.\n\n**My plan:**\nI want to collect more apples to catch up to enemy (14 vs 16). The closest apples are at (0,4) and (0,9). Moving LEFT to (0,1) gets me closer to (0,4). Moving UP to (1,2) is also safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple. Moving RIGHT to (2,1) is safe but might bring me closer to enemy.\n\nLEFT seems best: it moves me towards the apple at (0,4) and away from enemy. From (0,1), I can go UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,2) next turn. This path is relatively safe.\n\nRIGHT to (2,1) might risk future collision with enemy if it moves DOWN or LEFT, but not immediately. However, LEFT is safer and more direct to an apple.\n\nUP to (1,2) is neutral but doesn't progress towards an apple as directly.\n\nSo LEFT is preferred.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter moving to (0,1), aim for (0,4) apple. Then consider going up to (0,9) or other apples. Avoid enemy since it is longer. Keep building length safely.\n\nLEFT",

(empty), (1,0) is 'T' (my body).\n\nSo from head (0,1), available moves:\n- UP: (0,2) - empty (from row 2: at (0,2) is '.'? Row 2: \". . T T . T T .

This path is clear.\n\nDOWN to (0,0) is safe but not productive: it limits my options and doesn't lead to apples quickly.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best choice.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter moving UP to (0,2), aim for (0,4) apple.

Wait, checking board: at y=7, x=2 is '.' actually. Let's check: body list ends at (4,7), so (2,7) empty. Actually board shows at (2,7) '.' yes. So UP safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 5): my old head? That's now body segment (2, 5) will be new body after growth? Let's trace: current head (2,5), body starts (2,4)... If I eat apple at (2,6), new head (2,6), body becomes [(2,5), (2,4), ...]. So (2,5) is my body next turn, so DOWN invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 6): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6): empty.  \nSo from (2,6) after eating: 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good.  \n\nFrom (1, 5):  \n- UP (1,6): empty.  \n- DOWN (1,4): my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (0,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Less flexible.  \n\nFrom (3, 5):  \n- UP (3,6): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,4): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (2,5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (4,5): empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\nSo UP gives best future mobility after eating apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat path**  \n\nEnemy at (0,1) can only go UP or DOWN. It's far from me now. If it goes UP repeatedly, it could reach (0,4) apple in 3 turns, but I\u2019ll be elsewhere. Minimal direct threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \n\nEat (2,6) now. Next turn from (2,6), go UP to (2,7) to stay near top apples (0,9) or (1,9), or go LEFT toward (0,4). Avoid right side where my body is dense. After eating, my length increases, tail at (3,7) will move slowly. Keep space to maneuver.  \n\nUP gives apple now and keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,6), likely go UP to (2,7) unless enemy blocks, then aim for top apples while avoiding boxing myself.  \n\nUP",

(row 2: at (1,2) is '.'? Actually row 2: \"0 . T T . T T . T .\" so (1,2) is '.')\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy head at (2,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,7) - empty? (row 7: \". . . . T T A . . .\" so (2,7) is '.'? Actually (2,7) is '.'? Row 7: at col 2 is '.'?

This is direct and safe.\n\nRIGHT to (1,2) is also safe, but it moves me away from the (0,4) apple. From (1,2), I could go UP to (1,3) etc., but that might lead me into enemy territory? Enemy is at (2,6) and above. Also, my body is mostly on the bottom and right, so moving right might not be optimal.\n\nUP is better: it gets me closer to the apple at (0,4). After eating that, I can consider going to (0,9) or (1,9) apples.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nAfter eating (0,4), move up to (0,5), (0,6), etc. towards (0,9). Avoid enemy by staying on the left side.

Wait, but DOWN from (1,6) goes to (1,5) \u2014 that\u2019s empty now and will be empty next turn unless enemy moves there. So maybe 3 safe moves. Let\u2019s check all:  \nLEFT (0,6) empty, RIGHT (2,6) body, UP (1,7) empty, DOWN (1,5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.

Body after moving to (3,6) is [(2,6), (2,5), ...], so (3,5) empty.

Enemy is at (0,2) and can only go UP or RIGHT this turn. If enemy goes UP repeatedly, it could reach (0,4) apple and then maybe go toward top apples. I want to claim top apples before enemy can.  \n\nMoving UP to (2,7) positions me to go (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) in a few turns.  \nMoving LEFT to (1,6) also allows going up toward (1,9) but is slightly farther from (0,9) sequence.  \n\nAlso, my body is dense on right side (columns 4\u20136, rows 1\u20137), so moving RIGHT into (3,6) gets me closer to that congestion \u2014 riskier later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next few turns**  \n\nGo UP now to (2,7). Next turn, go UP to (2,8) if safe, then (2,9), then LEFT to (1,9) for apple, then (0,9). This path likely clear of enemy and my own body. Watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 if enemy goes UP several times, it might compete for (0,4) apple first, giving me time to take top apples.  \n\nAvoid moving right into body cluster. Keep options open by staying near top edge where there\u2019s more space.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Enemy is at (0,3) and will likely go UP to (0,4) to eat that apple, then maybe continue up toward (0,9). I need to move quickly toward top-left.  \n\nFrom (2,8), I can go (2,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) in two more moves after this turn.  \nFrom (3,7), I\u2019d have to go (3,8) \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9), slower.  \nFrom (1,7), I can go (1,8) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9), but mobility is worse after (1,7).  \n\nUP gives best balance of mobility and progress toward top apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid congestion**  \n\nMy body is dense in columns 4\u20136, rows 1\u20137. Moving RIGHT (3,7) gets closer to that congestion. Moving LEFT reduces mobility next turn. UP keeps me in open top area with more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nGo UP now to (2,8). Next turn, go UP to (2,9) if safe, then LEFT to (1,9) for apple, then LEFT to (0,9) for second apple. Watch enemy: if enemy goes UP to (0,4) this turn, it will be at (0,5) next turn, still 4 steps from (0,9). I can beat it there.  \n\nUP",

Then move RIGHT to (1,9) for the next apple. Avoid enemy by staying on the left. If enemy approaches, consider retreating down the left column or maneuvering safely.

T . . T . . . .\" so (1,5) is '.' \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy head at (1,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,9) - apple!

Row 8: \". 1 T . . . . . . .\" so (0,8) is '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - its own body \u274c\n\nEnemy can go UP (to apple at (1,9)), DOWN, or LEFT (to (0,8)). It will likely go UP to eat the apple at (1,9) since it is adjacent.\n\n**Why UP is best:**\n- Moving UP to (0,6) continues my path towards the apples at (0,9) and (1,9). However, enemy is likely to eat (1,9) this turn. So I should prioritize (0,9) first.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,5) doesn't help me reach the top apples quickly. It might lead me into enemy territory (enemy is above at (1,8)).\n- I need to get to (0,9) as fast as possible. Enemy might eat (1,9) this turn, but (0,9) is still available. If I go UP, I can reach (0,9) in 3 moves: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9). Enemy is at (1,8) and might also go to (0,8) or (0,9) later, so I must be cautious.\n- After eating (0,9), I can consider moving to (1,9) if enemy hasn't eaten it (but it probably will this turn), or retreat down the left column.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving UP along left edge to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), then (0,9) to eat the apple. Then assess enemy position. If enemy is near, retreat down the left column (which is mostly clear) or move right to (1,9) if safe. After that, consider moving towards the right-side apples (6,7) and (6,6) if safe. Avoid head-on collisions with enemy.\n\nUP",

Yes, because length 15, last segment (8,1) stays, second-to-last (8,0) becomes new last after shift.

Row 7: \". . T . . . A . . A\" so (0,7) is '.' \u2705\n- DOWN: (0,5) - my own body \u274c (invalid)\n- LEFT: (-1,6) - off board \u274c (invalid)\n- RIGHT: (1,6) - empty? Row 6: \"0 . T . . . A . . .\" so (1,6) is '.' \u2705\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nEnemy head at (1,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,10) - off board \u274c\n- DOWN: (1,8) - its own body (tail) \u274c\n- LEFT: (0,9) - apple! (row 9: col0 is 'A') \u2705\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - empty? Row 9: \"A 1 . . . . . . . .\" so (2,9) is '.' \u2705\n\nEnemy can go LEFT to (0,9) (apple) or RIGHT to (2,9). It will likely go LEFT to eat the apple at (0,9).\n\n**Why UP is best:**\n- I need to reach (0,9) quickly. Enemy is at (1,9) and will likely move LEFT to (0,9) this turn. If I go UP to (0,7), I can be at (0,8) next turn and then (0,9) the turn after. However, enemy will eat (0,9) this turn. So I cannot get it.\n- Alternatively, going RIGHT to (1,6) moves me away from the top row and towards the center. There are apples at (6,7) and (6,6) which are closer. Also, (1,4) is an apple below.\n- Since enemy is blocking (0,9), I should abandon it and target other apples. Going RIGHT to (1,6) is a step towards the apples at (6,7) and (6,6). Also, it avoids potential conflict with enemy at (0,9).\n- After RIGHT, I can plan to move towards (6,7) by going right and up. My tail is long and mostly along the bottom, so I have space to maneuver.\n- Enemy has 18 apples (closer to 30) and I have 14. I need to catch up. The apples at (6,7) and (6,6) are clustered and can be eaten quickly.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (1,6) to start heading towards the apples at (6,7) and (6,6). Then continue right and up. Avoid enemy which is likely to be near the top. Also, consider the apple at (1,4) as a backup. Since enemy is long, it might be constrained in movement, giving me opportunities.\n\nRIGHT",

If I go LEFT to (0, 9) and eat apple, enemy from (0, 6) could go UP to (0, 7) this turn, then UP to (0, 8) next turn, then UP to (0, 9) in 2 turns \u2014 but I\u2019ll be at (0, 9) this turn, so enemy would die if it moves into my body. However, if enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 6) this turn, it\u2019s not a threat.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 9), I avoid top-left corner but miss apple.  \n\nBetter to secure apple now and deal with potential enemy approach next turn by moving DOWN from (0, 9) into open space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \n\nAt (0, 9) after eating, only DOWN is safe next turn. That\u2019s risky but manageable if enemy isn\u2019t blocking (0, 8). Enemy could be at (0, 7) or (1, 6) next turn. If enemy is at (0, 7), moving DOWN to (0, 8) could lead to head-on collision if enemy moves UP to (0, 8) same turn \u2014 need to check:  \n\nEnemy at (0, 6) \u2192 if it moves UP to (0, 7) this turn, next turn from (0, 7) its safe moves: UP to (0, 8), DOWN to (0, 6) body, LEFT off, RIGHT to (1, 7). So it could go UP to (0, 8) same time I go DOWN to (0, 8) \u2192 collision. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBut if enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 6) this turn, next turn from (1, 6) its moves: UP to (1, 7), DOWN to (1, 5), LEFT to (0, 6), RIGHT to (2, 6). Then no conflict.  \n\nI can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move, but statistically enemy might avoid going UP into a corner where I might be. Still, risk exists.  \n\nAlternative: go RIGHT to (2, 9) now, keep more options open, but miss apple.  \n\nGiven my lead (18 vs 14 apples), securing apple and taking calculated risk is okay. If enemy goes UP to (0, 7) this turn, I can still go DOWN next turn and possibly collide \u2014 but if I see that risk, maybe I should go RIGHT instead to avoid potential collision.  \n\nWait \u2014 if enemy is at (0, 6) and I\u2019m at (0, 9), enemy doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ll be at (0, 9) when it chooses move this turn. It might avoid UP if it thinks I could be there. But it might gamble.  \n\nGiven the collision risk next turn, maybe RIGHT is safer long-term.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \n\nLEFT gets apple but potentially traps me with only DOWN next turn and possible head-on collision if enemy moves up.  \nRIGHT avoids risk, keeps path toward (9, 7) apple open, but misses immediate apple.  \n\nSince I have apple lead, preserving life and mobility is priority. I\u2019ll choose RIGHT to stay safe and keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 9), only safe move is RIGHT to (3, 9). Then from (3, 9) likely safe moves will be DOWN/RIGHT to move toward center and apples at (6, 7) or (9, 7). Monitor enemy\u2019s position \u2014 if enemy continues up column 0, it will be stuck in top-left soon.  \n\nRIGHT",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: (2,10) - off board \u274c\n- DOWN: (2,8) - its own body? Row 8: \". T T . . . . . . .\" so (2,8) is 'T' (enemy body) \u274c\n- LEFT: (1,9) - its own body?

So it will move there.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- (0,9) is still available. Enemy is moving away to (3,9), so (0,9) is now reachable.\n- (1,4) is an apple below me.\n- (6,7) and (6,6) are to the right and up.\n\n**Why UP is better:**\n- Going UP to (1,7) gets me closer to (0,9). From (1,7), I can go LEFT to (0,7) and then UP to (0,8) and (0,9). Enemy is moving to (3,9), so it won't interfere with (0,9) immediately.\n- Going DOWN to (1,5) gets me closer to (1,4) apple. But (1,4) is only one step away from (1,5). However, my tail is long and mostly at the bottom. Moving down might lead to trapping myself.\n- UP opens more options: I can continue up to the top row and then right towards the other apples (6,7) and (6,6). Also, enemy is moving right, so the top left is safer.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to (1,7) to target (0,9). Then proceed to eat (0,9) in two turns. After that, move right along the top to get the apples at (6,7) and (6,6). Avoid enemy which is now at (3,9) and likely to move further right. My tail is long and along the bottom, so I have space to maneuver in the top half.\n\nUP",

(empty) \u2192 safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 8): Occupied by my body (from list: (2,8) is in my body) \u2192 invalid.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 8): Board shows '.' at row 8 col 4 \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves this turn**  \nEnemy head: (0, 7)  \nFrom (0, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 8): empty (row 8 col 0 is '.').  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 6): occupied by enemy body (0,6) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 7): occupied by enemy body (1,7) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (0, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7): enemy goes UP to (0, 8) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 8): enemy goes UP to (0, 8) \u2192 no conflict.  \n\nBoth are safe from immediate collision with enemy head.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n\nFrom (3, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 8): my old head position, but after move, will it be free? After this turn, my body will be: head at (3,7), then (3,8) will be my second segment (old head). So UP next turn would be into my own body \u2192 invalid next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 6): empty now.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 7): empty now (row 7 col 2 is '.').  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7): empty now.  \n\nSo from (3, 7) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nFrom (4, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 9): empty now.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 7): empty now.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 8): will be my body after this turn \u2192 invalid next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8): empty now.  \n\nSo from (4, 8) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 9), (6, 7), (6, 6), (9, 7), (1, 4).  \n\nFrom (3, 8):  \n- DOWN to (3, 7): Manhattan distances:  \n  - to (6, 7): |3-6|+|7-7| = 3  \n  - to (6, 6): |3-6|+|7-6| = 4  \n  - to (9, 7): |3-9|+|7-7| = 6  \n\n- RIGHT to (4, 8):  \n  - to (6, 7): |4-6|+|8-7| = 3  \n  - to (6, 6): |4-6|+|8-6| = 4  \n  - to (9, 7): |4-9|+|8-7| = 6  \n\nEqual distances to nearest apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy is moving to (0, 8) this turn, possibly toward apple (0, 9). That\u2019s far from me.  \n\nMy long body is mostly on left side (cols 0\u20133). Moving RIGHT gets me away from my own body cluster, opening more space. Moving DOWN keeps me near the left side, which is more crowded with my own body.  \n\nAlso, apple at (6, 7) is reachable via going RIGHT then DOWN soon. If I go RIGHT now to (4, 8), next turn I can go RIGHT again to (5, 8) and then DOWN to (5, 7) toward apple.  \n\nGoing DOWN now to (3, 7) also allows moving RIGHT later, but is slightly farther from the right-side apples in steps.  \n\nGiven enemy is confined to top-left, I should claim space toward right-side apples while keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nMove toward right-side apples (6,7) and (6,6). Avoid getting pinned against my own body on left. From (4,8), next turn go RIGHT to (5,8) if safe, then down toward apple. Watch enemy\u2019s movement along top row\u2014they may go for (0,9) then move right along top, but I\u2019ll be ahead toward the other apples.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

(empty) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves this turn**  \nEnemy head: (0, 8)  \nFrom (0, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 9): Apple, but also possible for enemy.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 7): Occupied by enemy body (0,7) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 8): Occupied by my body (1,8) \u2192 invalid? Wait, check board: row 8 col 1 is 'T' (my tail segment). That\u2019s my body, so enemy moving RIGHT into my body would kill enemy, not me. But for my safety, I just need to avoid moving into enemy head or body.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (0, 9) (apple there).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nIf I go UP to (4, 9): enemy goes UP to (0, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7): enemy goes UP to (0, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8): enemy goes UP to (0, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \n\nAll safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n\nFrom (4, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 8): will be my body after move \u2192 invalid next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 9): my body after move \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 9): empty now.  \n\nSo from (4, 9) next turn, only 1 safe move (RIGHT). That\u2019s too risky.  \n\nFrom (4, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 8): my body after move \u2192 invalid next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7): empty.  \n\nSo from (4, 7) next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nFrom (5, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 8): my body after move \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 8): empty.  \n\nSo from (5, 8) next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nThus UP is bad (traps me), DOWN and RIGHT are good.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 9), (6, 7), (6, 6), (9, 7), (1, 4).  \n\nFrom (4, 8):  \n- DOWN to (4, 7):  \n  - to (6, 7): distance 2  \n  - to (6, 6): distance 3  \n- RIGHT to (5, 8):  \n  - to (6, 7): distance 2  \n  - to (6, 6): distance 3  \n\nEqual distances, but DOWN gets me closer to the lower apple cluster (6,7) and (6,6) in fewer steps if I go RIGHT next turn? Let\u2019s check:  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7), next turn I can go RIGHT to (5, 7) \u2192 distance to (6, 7) = 1.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (5, 7) \u2192 distance to (6, 7) = 1.  \n\nSame.  \n\nBut apple at (1, 4) is far and near my long body tail\u2014avoid that area to not trap myself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy will eat apple (0, 9) this turn, growing to length 15. My length is 19. I should focus on securing the two apples at (6, 7) and (6, 6) before enemy can get them.  \n\nFrom (4, 7) or (5, 8), I can reach (6, 7) in two moves. But from (4, 7), I\u2019m closer to my own body on the left\u2014might limit future moves if I need to dodge. From (5, 8), I\u2019m more central with open space right and down.  \n\nAlso, enemy after eating (0, 9) will be at (0, 9) with body extending down col 0. They\u2019ll be far from (6, 7) for at least 3\u20134 turns.  \n\nI should move RIGHT to (5, 8) to claim space toward right side apples while keeping open options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nNext turn from (5, 8), go DOWN to (5, 7) if safe, then RIGHT to (6, 7) to eat apple. Watch enemy\u2019s movement along top row\u2014they may head right toward (9, 7) after eating (0, 9), so race them to (6, 7) and (6, 6). Avoid getting pinned against my own body on left.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

That can't be right. Let me double-check the board state:\n\nRow 9: \"0 T T T . . . . . .\"  \n- (0,9) is my head ('0')\n- (1,9) is 'T' (enemy body)\n- (2,9) is 'T'\n- (3,9) is 'T'\n- (4,9) is '.'

But that seems unlikely. Let me verify the coordinates:\n\nMy head is at (0,9). \n- UP: (0,10) - y=10 is off board (max y=9)\n- DOWN: (0,8) - my body segment (0,8) is right below me\n- LEFT: (-1,9) - off board\n- RIGHT: (1,9) - enemy body (from snake #1)\n\nIndeed, all moves are fatal.

But the board state shows (0,9) was an apple, and I moved UP to eat it. Now I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the enemy moved? Last turn, enemy head was at (4,8). Now it's at (5,8). So enemy moved RIGHT to (5,8). That didn't affect my position.\n\nBut indeed, from (0,9), I have no safe moves. This is a fatal position.\n\nIs there any possibility? Let me check if (1,9) is truly occupied: Snake #1 body includes (1,9) (from its list: (1,9) is in its body). So yes.\n\nTherefore, I have no safe moves. The game rules say I must choose a move, but all will kill me. So I am doomed this turn.\n\nHowever, I must still choose a move. Since all are equally fatal, I'll choose RIGHT to (1,9) which is enemy body, meaning I die.\n\nBut let me confirm if there's any escape: Perhaps the enemy might move away? But moves are simultaneous, so (1,9) remains occupied.\n\nNo, I'm truly trapped. This is the end.\n\nSo my move: RIGHT (to die).\n\n**Long-term plan note for future self (if applicable):**\nAvoid getting trapped in corners. Always check future moves from potential positions.
