If I go DOWN to (7,2), I can head toward (4,1) with a straightforward path: (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1). This keeps me away from the enemy and avoids tight traps.\n- UP would push me toward (2,4) but requires a longer route and offers more chances to intersect with the opponent\u2019s moves later. LEFT could also work but seems slightly longer to the nearby apple.\n\nPlan:\n- Start by moving DOWN to (7,2) to begin the direct route to (4,1), then proceed LEFT along y=2 toward (4,2) and finally (4,1) to collect the apple.\n- After securing that apple, reassess: likely pivot toward the next available apple (e.g., (2,4)) while maintaining space from the enemy and avoiding self-trapping. Keep an eye on possible head-on collisions and preserve at least two safe options each turn.\n\nDOWN",
