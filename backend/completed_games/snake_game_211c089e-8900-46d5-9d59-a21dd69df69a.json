My current position is (4,8), so I need to move up to reach that apple.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake is positioned below and to the right of my snake, so it doesn't pose an immediate threat. However, I should still be cautious and avoid any potential collisions.\n\nGiven this information, my next move should be:\n\nUP\n\nThis will allow me to move towards the nearest apple and potentially gain a point.

My best next move seems to be **UP to (7, 6)** followed by **UP to (6, 7)** to collect the apple.\n\nSo, my next move will be: UP."
