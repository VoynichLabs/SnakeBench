Now I'll evaluate which move is best strategically.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- Closest apple to me: (1, 8) is 5 cells away left and 1 cell up\n- Other nearby: (8, 6) is 2 cells right and 1 cell down\n- (0, 5) is 6 left, 2 down\n- (9, 3) is 3 right, 4 down\n- (3, 2) is 3 left, 5 down\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n**UP (6, 8)**: Moves toward apple at (1, 8). This is a good long-term direction. Gets me closer to the apple in the upper-left region.\n\n**DOWN (6, 6)**: Moves closer to (8, 6) apple on the right side. Only 2 cells away. This could get me an apple quickly.\n\n**LEFT (5, 7)**: Moves toward (1, 8) apple area. Keeps options open.\n\n**RIGHT (7, 7)**: Moves away from nearest apples. Less optimal.\n\n**Best Choice:** DOWN is attractive because (8, 6) is very close (just 2 cells away on the right). However, UP also moves toward (1, 8) which is relatively close. The apple at (8, 6) is only 2 cells away diagonally, making DOWN followed by RIGHT a promising two-move sequence.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if I go DOWN to (6, 6), then next turn I could go RIGHT to (7, 6) and then RIGHT again to (8, 6) to get the apple. That's a quick path.\n\nAlternatively, UP keeps me flexible and moves toward the (1, 8) apple.\n\nGiven the immediate proximity of (8, 6), I'll go DOWN to start moving toward it efficiently.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:** After this move, I should position to grab the apple at (8, 6). Watch the enemy snake at (6, 5) - if it moves up, we could collide. Plan to move right and grab that apple quickly, then pivot toward other apples.\n\nDOWN",

If I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I'll be adjacent to it. Next turn, I can move RIGHT again to (8, 6) and collect it for my first apple.\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nEnemy is at (7, 5). If I move RIGHT to (7, 6), the enemy could move UP to (7, 6) and collide with me - that would be a head-on collision and both would die. Let me check: the enemy is currently one space down and one space right of me. If the enemy moves UP, it goes to (7, 6) where I would be moving. This is a potential collision risk.\n\nHowever, the enemy could also move in other directions. Given that both snakes are still tiny and early game, I should prioritize securing the apple.\n\n**Alternative: DOWN to (6, 5)**\nMoving down brings me closer to the (0, 5) apple area and gives me a clearer path without collision risk from the enemy's likely moves.\n\n**Alternative: UP to (6, 7)**\nThis moves me toward (1, 8) apple but takes longer.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe risk of RIGHT is a potential head-on collision. DOWN keeps me safe and still moves toward apples while maintaining distance from enemy. After DOWN, I can move LEFT toward (0, 5) or reassess based on enemy position.\n\nActually, reconsidering: RIGHT toward (8, 6) is still the best strategic move for apple collection despite the collision risk, because the enemy might move in a different direction. Let me be more cautious and choose DOWN to secure safety while still progressing toward apples.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (6, 5), reassess enemy position and plan the next move. If enemy moved away, consider moving RIGHT to approach (8, 6). Otherwise, pursue other apples like (0, 5) on the left or maintain safe distance.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is directly to my right. Moving RIGHT could lead to a collision if the enemy also moves RIGHT or if I get cornered.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nMoving LEFT toward (1, 8) seems promising - it takes me away from the enemy and toward an apple in the upper-left corner. Alternatively, moving DOWN avoids the enemy entirely and opens up paths toward (4, 2) or (9, 3).\n\nMoving UP takes me to (6, 7), which puts me closer to (1, 8) and keeps me away from the enemy. This seems safe and positions me well.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is actually better. It takes me directly away from the enemy at (8, 6) and toward the left side of the board where apples (1, 8) and (0, 5) are located. This maintains distance from the enemy and opens multiple apple-hunting paths.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT, assess the enemy's position. If they're following, move UP toward (1, 8). If they're moving elsewhere, I can continue left or adjust based on apple positions. The goal is to secure apples while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

I'd collect it and grow. The enemy is at (0, 6), which is directly above this apple. This is safe since the enemy can't move into me this turn.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (2, 5):** This would move into my own body at (2, 5) - **DEATH** \u2717\n\n3. **UP to (1, 6):** Safe move but moves away from the nearest apple. Enemy is at (0, 6), so moving to (1, 6) puts me next to the enemy head but not in a collision.\n\n4. **DOWN to (1, 4):** Safe move but moves away from the nearest apple at (0, 5).\n\n**Best Choice Analysis:**\n\nLEFT is clearly the best move because:\n- It allows me to collect the apple at (0, 5), increasing my score to 3 apples\n- This puts me ahead of the enemy (3-2)\n- The enemy head at (0, 6) cannot collide with me at (0, 5) this turn\n- After collecting this apple, I'll have more room to maneuver with the extra body segment\n- This is the closest apple available and guarantees a point\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (0, 5), I'll be at (0, 5) with body at [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]. Next priorities:\n- Monitor the enemy's movement pattern\n- Head toward (6, 3) or (8, 5) as the next closest apples\n- Avoid getting trapped in the left edge of the board\n- Keep distance from enemy snake #0\n\nLEFT",

DOWN gets me the apple at (0,5), and while the enemy could also target that spot, they are unlikely to willingly run into my head so they can avoid that move and instead pick another safe square. Grabbing the apple gives me the lead and grows my body; after that I can move east along the wall to keep space between me and the enemy while I hunt for the other apples in the southern half of the board.\n\nPlan: After eating (0,5), swing east and stay out of the enemy\u2019s direct path so I can circle back to the apples near the center without getting boxed in.\n\nDOWN",
