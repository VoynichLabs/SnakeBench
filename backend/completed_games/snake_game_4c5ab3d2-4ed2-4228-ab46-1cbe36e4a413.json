This position hasn't been claimed or occupied recently, so it's safe unless there's an unseen obstacle.\n- Moving LEFT would lead to (1,8), which is also safe but perhaps less strategic currently.\n- Moving DOWN would take me to (2,7), which seems less strategic given potential apples and avoiding threats.\n- Moving toward apples that are closer is a good strategy: the apple at (3, 9) is directly above and to the right. That suggests I should consider moving UP or RIGHT.\n\nPotential hazards:\n- Moving UP to (2, 9): would be adjacent to the apple at (3, 9) but not directly on it (which is good). But the cell (2, 9) is empty; moving up is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 8): also safe and closer to the apple at (3, 9). Actually, moving RIGHT from (2,8) to (3,8) positions me right beneath the apple at (3, 9). Moving up from (3,8) to (3, 9) would be better, but I need to position myself accordingly.\n\nI notice that moving RIGHT now would take me to (3,8), which is close to the apple at (3, 9). Once there, I can move UP in the following turn to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, going UP from (2,8) to (2,9) gets me slightly further away later because the apple is at (3,9), but moving UP is also a safe momentum.\n\nBecause moving RIGHT immediately moves me closer to the apple at (3,9), I will choose to go RIGHT, then aim to go UP on the subsequent move.\n\nThe enemy snake at (9,4) is far to the right, so no immediate threat there.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move now is to go RIGHT.\n\n**Next move**: RIGHT",
