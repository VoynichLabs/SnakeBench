RIGHT: (7, 8)\n   - NOT SAFE - this is my own body segment\n\nThe enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (9, 1) and has one segment at (9, 2). It's near the apple at (8, 0) and (5, 1). I should be cautious of potential head-on collisions, but currently, none of my safe moves put me in immediate danger of collision with the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering the strategic position and the available apples, I believe DOWN is the best move. It:\n- Moves me toward multiple apples\n- Keeps my options open for future moves\n- Avoids moving into a corner or edge where I might get trapped\n- Positions me well for future apple collection\n\nI'll choose DOWN as my move.<|end_of_box|>\nDOWN",

DOWN: (6, 6) - This moves me toward the bottom of the board, positioning me closer to apples at (5, 1), (5, 2), and (1, 2)\n3. LEFT: (5, 7) - This moves horizontally toward the apple at (5, 2)\n4.
