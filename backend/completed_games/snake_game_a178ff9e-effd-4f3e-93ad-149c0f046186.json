But apples are RIGHT there! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **RIGHT** to (2,5): Centralizes us, keeps all four directions open, and moves us toward more apples like (4,4) and (5,3).

Both snakes still have no body, so backwards moves are safe for now. But we gotta think about where the enemy could go!\n\n**Immediate safety check:**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (2,6): empty.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,4): empty.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,5): empty.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5): empty.  \n\nAll four moves are safe from walls and bodies! \u2705\n\nBut wait\u2026 enemy head is at (3,3). Their possible moves: UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3).\n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf we go RIGHT to (3,5), they could go UP to (3,4) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf we go DOWN to (2,4), they could go LEFT to (2,3) \u2014 no conflict.  \nActually, no direct head-on possible this turn because we\u2019re two apart vertically. Good.\n\n**Long-term positioning:**  \nWe want to dominate the center and cut off enemy expansion. Moving RIGHT to (3,5) puts us closer to apples at (4,4) and (5,3), and also positions us to threaten boxing them against the left wall if they stay low.  \nMoving UP to (2,6) gets us closer to apples at (0,6) and (4,7), but edges us toward the top boundary \u2014 could limit options.  \nMoving LEFT to (1,5) moves toward apple at (0,4) but sticks us near the left edge \u2014 risky.  \nMoving DOWN to (2,4) gets us toward apple at (4,4) but also closer to enemy \u2014 could provoke early clash when we\u2019re same length.\n\nSince both snakes are length 1, a head-on collision now would kill us both \u2014 tie game. We want to avoid that unless we have an advantage. We don\u2019t yet.\n\n**Best aggressive but safe move:** RIGHT to (3,5). Centralizes us, keeps 4-direction freedom next turn, and sets up to grab apples while watching enemy movement.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** See where enemy goes. If they move UP toward (3,4), we can consider moving DOWN to (3,4) next turn to contest space, but only if we\u2019re confident they won\u2019t go same direction. Otherwise, grab apples and grow to gain advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

Seems like the clearest way to maintain pressure AND grow.\n\nMy goal is to keep corners sealed without getting boxed in, so I\u2019ll take the apple and start stacking a body that can help me corral him soon.\n\nPlan note to future self: after grabbing this apple, keep circling around the midline and close the \u201cU\u201d between us by cutting across the two top rows\u2014force him to either backtrack into you or risk a head-on when you\u2019re already ahead.\n\nRIGHT",

Both snakes still length 1, so no body yet.\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,6): empty \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4): OOPS that's enemy head! That's a potential head-on collision if they move UP into us or stay still? Wait \u2014 simultaneous move. If we go DOWN to (3,4) and they go UP to (3,5), we swap spots and both live. But if they go DOWN to (3,3) or LEFT/RIGHT, we move into an empty cell. BUT if they ALSO go UP to (3,5), we both go into (3,4)? No \u2014 they'd be moving from (3,4) to (3,5), we'd be moving from (3,5) to (3,4). That's a head-on collision? Actually no \u2014 we'd pass each other, different cells. But if they go DOWN to (3,3), we go DOWN to (3,4), that's safe. Risky though \u2014 what if they go LEFT/RIGHT? Then (3,4) is empty for us. So DOWN is *potentially* safe but **could** cause head-on if they move UP? Wait, simultaneous moves: if we both move into each other's previous cell, that's fine. Head-on is only if we move into the SAME cell. So DOWN to (3,4) while they move UP to (3,5) means we go to (3,4), they go to (3,5) \u2014 different cells. So DOWN is *technically* safe from instant death? But if they move UP, we'd be adjacent next turn. Hmm.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,5): empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,5): empty \u2705\n\nSo all four are *board-safe*, but DOWN has enemy head in target cell currently. But since they'll move, it might be empty by the time we get there.\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (3,4):**\nUP to (3,5) \u2014 that's our current head! If they do that and we stay still, we die. If we move DOWN to (3,4), they move UP to (3,5), we swap \u2014 both live.\nDOWN to (3,3) \u2014 safe.\nLEFT to (2,4) \u2014 safe.\nRIGHT to (4,4) \u2014 safe.\n\n**Collision risk this turn:**\nIf we go DOWN to (3,4) and they go UP to (3,5), we swap \u2014 no head-on.\nIf we go DOWN and they go DOWN to (3,3), we land in (3,4) empty.\nIf we go DOWN and they go LEFT/RIGHT, we land in (3,4) empty.\nSo DOWN is *safe* from instant death.\n\nBut chat \u2014 is it *smart*? We're length 1, they're length 1. Head-on collision now would tie. We want to grow first! So maybe avoid moving into their face.\n\n**Positioning:**\nWe want to control space. Moving RIGHT to (4,5) gets us toward apples at (4,4) and (5,3) and centralizes.\nMoving UP to (3,6) gets us toward (4,7) apple but edges top.\nMoving LEFT to (2,5) gets us toward left-side apples but less central.\nMoving DOWN \u2014 risky because next turn we could be adjacent if they move UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nGrow fast, then trap them against wall. They're at (3,4), near left-center. We can take apples on right side and get longer, then encircle.\n\n**Best move for growth + safety:**\nRIGHT to (4,5). Puts us near two apples, keeps distance from enemy, opens more options next turn.\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m not about that double KO life, especially with the score 1-0 in our favor. \ud83d\ude24\n- LEFT is straight into our own body (remember that (3,4) segment right behind us), so that\u2019s an instant no-go. We can\u2019t kill ourselves trying to look tough.\n- DOWN would give us some breathing room at (4,3), but it also invites him to swoop into the center and run the board while we shrink back. Not the kind of aggression our fans tuned in for! \ud83d\ude0e\n- RIGHT gets us to (5,4), keeps us mobile, keeps the eastern corridor open, and starts forming that body length we need to box him in. He\u2019s stuck above us, and moving east sets up a nice little barrier\u2014he\u2019s gonna have to guess whether we cut him off or bait him into our trap.\n\nPlan note to future self: Keep pressing east and start curling around the middle\u2014build a wall between us and him, then snap back south to pinch him against the bottom wall.

Apple at (4,8) near us, apple at (6,7) above them, apple at (5,3) far. They might go UP for (6,7) apple to grow to 5! Or LEFT to (5,6) to pressure us.\n\nOUR STRATEGY: We NEED to grow ASAP! Can't fight longer snake head-on. Must grab apples safely. Look at board: Apple at **(4,8)** directly above us! That's the play! Eat it next turn if we go UP now. But careful\u2014if enemy goes LEFT to (5,6), they're adjacent diagonally to (4,8)? Actually, (5,6) is not adjacent to (4,8) (they'd need UP+LEFT). Hmm.\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:\n- **UP to (4,8)**: Puts us ON APPLE next turn? No, apple at (4,8) is already there! Wait, check apple list: (4,8) IS an apple! So moving UP to (4,8) would EAT IT THIS TURN and grow to length 3 immediately! \ud83c\udf4e That's HUGE! Then our new head at (4,8), new tail? Body becomes [(4,7), (4,6)]. Length 3! Still shorter than enemy (4 vs 3), but closer!\n- **LEFT to (3,7)**: No apple there. Puts us further from most apples. Safe but passive.\n- **RIGHT to (5,7)**: No apple there. Puts us closer to enemy if they go LEFT to (5,6)\u2014adjacent next turn? That's risky head-on potential.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK: If we go RIGHT to (5,7) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,6), we're adjacent vertically? Actually (5,7) and (5,6) are adjacent (one above/below). Next turn, if we both move toward each other, possible head-on? But they're longer, we lose. So RIGHT feels risky.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: GRAB THAT (4,8) APPLE NOW! Grow to 3. Then next turn, assess. Enemy will likely be at (6,7) if they go UP, or (5,6) if they go LEFT. If they're at (6,7), we're at (4,8)\u2014safe distance. We can then target another apple like (4,9) or (3,9) to grow more.

Their safe moves: UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7). They're longer! They might go for apples: Apple at (4,9) near us? Apple at (6,8) above them? Apple at (5,3) far. They might go UP for (6,8) apple to grow to 5! Or LEFT to (5,7) to pressure us.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK: If we go RIGHT to (5,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,7), we're adjacent vertically! Next turn potential head-on? They're longer, we lose. If we go LEFT to (3,8), safer distance. If we go UP to (4,9), we're further from their likely moves.\n\nAPPLE GRAB OPPORTUNITY: Apple at (4,9) directly above us! Moving UP eats it THIS TURN, grows to length 4! That's HUGE! Then we'd be TIED LENGTH with enemy (both 4)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80 Apple at (3,9) nearby too for future.\n\nFUTURE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:\n- **UP to (4,9)**: Eats apple, grow to 4. New head at (4,9). Next turn safe moves? Probably UP (off board \u274c), DOWN to (4,8) (empty?), LEFT to (3,9) (apple?), RIGHT to (5,9) (empty). Good options.\n- **LEFT to (3,8)**: No apple there. Puts us closer to apple at (3,9) for next turn? But also closer to enemy if they go LEFT to (5,7)? Still distance 2.\n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**: No apple. Puts us adjacent risk if enemy goes LEFT. Feels aggressive but risky.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We NEED TO MATCH LENGTH! Eating the (4,9) apple NOW gets us to 4, tied with enemy! Then we can play more aggressively, maybe force a head-on if we get longer. Avoid risky adjacency until we're longer. After eating, next turn maybe grab (3,9) apple to become length 5 and take the lead! DOMINATE THE BOARD!\n\nBEST MOVE: **UP** to (4,9) to EAT THAT APPLE, GROW TO 4, AND TIE THE LENGTH!

Actually (4,9) vs (4,8) is vertical, not same cell.  \n- If we go DOWN to (3,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,8), we're adjacent horizontally. Could set up a head-on next turn if we both move into (4,8) or (3,8)? But we have length advantage, so could be aggressive.\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITY:**  \nApple at **(1,9)** far left, apple at **(9,9)** far right, apple at **(4,0)** far down. Closest apple is maybe (1,9) but 2 steps left. Not urgent. We have length lead, so focus on **TRAPPING ENEMY**!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe're longer! Time to **PRESSURE AND BOX THEM IN**! Enemy is in bottom-right area. We can move to **CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE ROUTES** toward center/walls.  \n- If we go **DOWN to (3,8)**, we block their potential move up toward us, and we're closer to center.  \n- If we go **LEFT to (2,9)**, we go toward left-side apples but maybe waste pressure.  \n- If we go **RIGHT to (4,9)**, we stay near them but risk getting pinched if they go UP to (5,9)? Actually they'd be at (5,9), we at (4,9), safe.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** I think **DOWN to (3,8)**! It opens more future options (can go left/right/down next), puts us closer to center and enemy, and avoids being stuck on top edge. Let's **PUSH THEM INTO A CORNER**! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",
