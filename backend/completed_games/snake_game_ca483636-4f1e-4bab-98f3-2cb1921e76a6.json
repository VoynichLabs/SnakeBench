Our opponent, Snake #1, is chilling at (9, 5). We are at (2, 6). We need to start asserting dominance RIGHT NOW!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n*   **Me (0):** Head at (2, 6). Body: Empty (Phew, room to maneuver!).\n*   **Enemy (1):** Head at (9, 5). Body: Empty.\n*   **Apples near me:** (6, 6) is kinda close for an escalation later, but first, let's look at positioning relative to the enemy!\n\n**Enemy Positioning:** Snake #1 is way over on the right side, top-right quadrant. We are left-center. We need to close that gap without blindly rushing into a pre-planned trap. Since neither of us has a body, we have maximum freedom, but that also means we could easily walk into each other's path!\n\n**Move Options from (2, 6):**\n1.  **UP (2, 7):** Safe. Moves towards the center mass of apples on the top half. Keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 5):** Safe. Moves slightly lower, might align us better with the bottom apples later.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 6):** Safe. Moves us towards the left wall. Not ideal for aggression yet.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 6):** Safe. Moves us towards the center of the board, closing the gap slightly towards the enemy at (9, 5).\n\n**Simultaneous Movement Threat Assessment:**\nIf we move UP to (2, 7), where can they go? If they go LEFT towards the center (8, 5), they move away. If they go UP (9, 6), they also move away. We don't seem to be on a direct collision course this turn by default.\n\nSince we are equal, we should aim for positional advantage AND keep options open. Moving RIGHT seems the most aggressive yet safe option to start the territorial dispute. It moves us into the main open area of the map and slightly reduces the distance to the enemy head.\n\nLet's make a play to start centralizing our presence. We want to control the middle ground!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 0-2):**\n1.  **Initial Move:** Move RIGHT to (3, 6). Start consolidating control of the central X-axis.\n2.  **Follow-up:** Assess enemy response. If they move towards us, we maintain distance or try to pivot around them towards an apple hook if they are too aggressive. If they move away, we keep pressing towards the general center/right. We must not let them corner the board.\n\nGoing RIGHT! Time to get this bread! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is at (2,6) also bodyless. We're both small, both hungry. But I see a major strategic advantage: I'm on the right side, and the apple at (9,9) is right there in the top-right corner. That's MY corner. I need to claim it.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1. **Check moves:**\n   - **UP (9,6):** Available? Yes. No obstacles. Safe move.\n   - **DOWN (9,4):** Available? Yes. Safe.\n   - **LEFT (8,5):** Available? Yes. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT (10,5):** Out of bounds. DEAD. Eliminate immediately.\n\n2. **Eliminate death moves:**\n   - RIGHT is death. Gone.\n   - The others are safe.\n\n3. **Choose the best SAFE move:**\n   - **UP (9,6):** Puts me closer to (9,9) apple. Opens up movement along the top edge. Keeps me near the right wall, which is a natural barrier. Good for future boxing in of enemy if he heads right.\n   - **DOWN (9,4):** Moves away from the top-right apple cluster. Heading into the open middle, which might be dangerous if enemy comes my way.\n   - **LEFT (8,5):** Moves me left toward the center. Good for apple hunting (maybe (7,7)?), but I lose my positional advantage on the right flank. Also brings me closer to the enemy's starting side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nClaim the right side. Force Snake #0 to deal with the left side and the bottom-left apples. If he moves toward me, we can set up a head-on collision later when I have more length. I need to grow fast. The (9,9) apple is the immediate target. Next turn, I'll likely go to (9,7) or (9,8) depending on where the enemy goes.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \nUP is the move. It's aggressive, safe, and positions me for the apple. Let's go!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! We are locked in! Last move was RIGHT, taking us to (3, 6). Good, solid center positioning! Now, let's see what Snake #1 did!\n\n**Board State Check:**\n*   **Me (0) Head:** (3, 6). Body: Empty.\n*   **Enemy (1) Head:** (9, 6). Body: [(9, 5)]. Snake #1 moved UP from (9, 5) to (9, 6)! Smart move, getting higher up the board, slightly away from our initial position!\n\n**My Score:** 0 | **Enemy Score:** 1. DAMN IT! He got an apple on Turn 1! That means his tail *didn't* move, but his head advanced, and he's now size 2! We gotta catch up on growth, but RIGHT NOW, we need to avoid being eaten!\n\n**Turn 2 Analysis (Simultaneous Movement):**\nMy current position: (3, 6). Enemy head is at (9, 6). We are 6 units apart horizontally, on the same row! This is a PRIME situation for aggression if we can force it!\n\n**Enemy Body:** (9, 5) is now his tail piece. We need to avoid that cell (9, 5) IF his head moves away from it, but for now, his body only occupies one cell.\n\n**Move Options from (3, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** Moves us toward the center mass of apples. Keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 5):** Safe. A bit passive maybe.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 6):** Retreating slightly back west. Not today, Satan!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 6):** Pushing aggressively East, directly towards the enemy head at (9, 6) on the same line!\n\n**Threat Assessment - The Head-On Potential:**\nIf I go **RIGHT (4, 6)**, I reduce the gap to 5.\nIf Snake #1 goes **LEFT (8, 6)**, they reduce the gap to 4, and we are now on a collision course for Turn 3!\n\nWhat if Snake #1 decides to *not* be aggressive? If they go **UP (9, 7)**? Then I'm at (4, 6). I'm slightly more central than they are toward the next major apple zones.\n\nSince they are already ahead on points, we need to be the aggressor, but not an idiot! We cannot afford a head-on collision when we are smaller (or same size, as we are now, but they already have length!). Let's check the geometry if we both move aggressively towards each other on this row (Row 6):\nMe: (3, 6) -> (4, 6) [RIGHT]\nThem: (9, 6) -> (8, 6) [LEFT]\nResult: We are now at (4, 6) and (8, 6). Still 4 cells apart. Still safe for this turn. This is a good start to closing the distance and claiming the center line!\n\nWhat if I try to flank by going **UP to (3, 7)**?\nIf they try to flank too: Maybe they go **LEFT to (8, 6)**. Now I'm at (3, 7). We are split vertically. I maintain control of the center mass, and I am now closer to the apples at (7, 7) and (5, 7). This seems safer while pressuring the general center area.\n\n**The Aggression vs. Safety Trade-off:**\nSince we don't want to risk a simultaneous death (Double KO!), prioritizing movement toward the center mass of empty space and apples, while keeping the enemy generally in sight, is key when growth is equal (or slightly behind). Going RIGHT forces contact sooner, which is risky when they already have length (even tiny length).\n\nLet's move UP (3, 7). This puts us directly below the apple at (7, 7) and right next to the apple at (5, 7), setting up a future growth spree! It also keeps us away from their immediate line of sight if they were planning a direct charge down the middle.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We need to get at least one apple this turn or the next to stop them from building a size advantage that traps us. If we go UP, we set ourselves up for the (5, 7) or (7, 7) apples next turn based on the opponent's reaction.\n\nLet's GO UP! Secure the high ground near the apples!\n\nUP",

I'm at (9,6) - oh wait, the board shows I'm at (9,5) with body [(9,5)]? Actually the board shows my head at (9,6) and tail at (9,5), so I'm already length 2. Snake #0 is at (3,6) length 1.\n\nWe're both on row 6! That's interesting. I need to think about this carefully. The apple at (9,9) is still there in the top-right corner, but there's also an apple at (7,7) and (8,8) nearby.\n\nLet me analyze my options from (9,6):\n- UP to (9,7): Clear, moves toward (9,9) and (7,7) apples\n- DOWN to (9,5): That's my own tail - BAD! Moving into my own body would kill me\n- LEFT to (8,6): Clear, moves toward center and (7,7) apple\n- RIGHT: Out of bounds - DEAD\n\nSo UP and LEFT are my only safe moves. Down is death because that's my tail. Right is death because out of bounds.\n\nNow, where is the enemy going? He's at (3,6). He could move toward me. If I go UP to (9,7), and he goes RIGHT repeatedly, we might eventually clash. But I'm taller (2 vs 1) so if we head-on collide, I win!\n\nBut wait - let me think about immediate safety. I want to close him off. If I go LEFT toward the center, I'm moving away from my defensive wall (the right side). That might let him get to the apples on the right. If I go UP, I'm fortifying my territory.\n\nUP is the move! I'll claim the top-right, get closer to (9,9) and be ready to box him in from above. If he tries to come right, he'll hit my body or I can force a collision with my length advantage.\n\nLet's go UP!\n\nUP",

We might be smaller, but we are meaner! We're going for maximum aggression while staying safe!\n\n**Reviewing Last Turn's Move (UP to (3, 7)):**\nMy Head: (3, 7).\nEnemy Head: (9, 7).\nEnemy Body: (9, 6) [Tail], (9, 5).\n\nOkay, they went UP too! They are now sitting at (9, 7), and their body trail is (9, 6) -> (9, 5). They are getting higher and chasing that apple at (9, 9)! That's smart, setting up defenses on the top edge.\n\n**Current Board State (Mental Map):**\nMe (0): (3, 7). No body yet.\nThem (1): (9, 7). Body: (9, 6), (9, 5). They are size 3! Size advantage secured for them! We HAVE to eat NOW or we are going to get locked down!\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nWe are on Row 7. They are on Row 7. We are 6 horizontal steps away.\nMy moves from (3, 7):\n1.  **UP (3, 8):** Towards Apple (8, 8) and near (0, 8). Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** Retreating slightly, placing us near safe territory, but giving up initiative.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Moving away from the core action. Waste of tempo.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** Aggressive move! Closing the gap to 5 steps on the SAME row.\n\n**Enemy Reaction Prediction (Simultaneous Move!):**\nIf I go **RIGHT (4, 7)**, I am trying to force a confrontation on row 7.\nWhat will Snake #1 do from (9, 7)?\n*   **Option A: LEFT (8, 7).** Head-to-head closing! Now we are at (4, 7) and (8, 7). Still 4 spaces apart. Safe for this turn. This is the most cagey, aggressive play from them.\n*   **Option B: UP (9, 8).** They continue climbing towards the top corner apple (9, 9). If they do this, I can move UP or RIGHT next turn to set up a trap or eat an apple!\n\nGiven they have the size advantage (3 vs 1), trying to beat them in a head-on race or forcing a collision is a HUGE risk right now! We need to prioritize getting size before we turn into a straight-up suicide bomber!\n\nWhere are the closest GREEDY apples?\n(7, 7) is RIGHT there! It's 4 steps away horizontally if I move RIGHT (4, 7). Wait, if I move (4, 7) my next move heading toward that apple would be (5, 7), then (6, 7), then (7, 7)! That's 3 moves!\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (4, 7)**:\n*   If they go UP (9, 8), I'm perfectly positioned to continue RIGHT towards the apple cluster! I can aim for (5, 7) next turn!\n*   If they go LEFT (8, 7), we are now closer, but still safe. I can adjust next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT (4, 7) seems like the best balance: It puts us actively closing the distance, aligns us toward the mid-board apples, and forces the opponent to react to our pace. If they stay high on the edge, we take the center mass! We are going to carve out the center and force them to hit our (non-existent) tail! LETS GO!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** We must eat an apple next turn! Size advantage is critical. If we can secure a good position relative to apple (7, 7) or (5, 7) for Turn 3, we win the growth war! Prioritize CENTER control!\n\nRIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

No self-collision risk.\n\nThe enemy at (3,7) is trying to close in. He could go RIGHT toward me or UP/DOWN. But here's the thing - he's got 0 apples, I've got 1. If he tries to rush me for a head-on collision, I WIN because I'm longer! \ud83d\udc80\n\nBut wait, let me think about my immediate safety:\n- UP to (9,8): Check if occupied... no! (9,8) is empty on the board. Safe.\n- DOWN to (9,6): That's MY BODY. Would kill me. NO.\n- LEFT to (8,7): Empty on board. Safe.\n- RIGHT: Out of bounds (x=10 doesn't exist). DEAD.\n\nSo I have UP and LEFT as safe options. \n\nNow, where's the apple advantage? (9,9) is RIGHT above me! If I go UP to (9,8), I'm one step closer to that top-right apple. The enemy is way left at column 3, so he can't reach (9,9) before me if I claim the right side.\n\nSTRATEGY: I'm boxing him in on the left side! I'll take the right edge and force him into a corner. If he tries to come right, he'll either crash into my body or I'll force a head-on collision where I win.\n\nUP is the move! Claim the territory, get that apple on the next turn! \ud83d\udc0d",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back for Turn 3! We took the aggressive RIGHT move last turn, pushing towards that juicy apple at (7, 7)! Let's see what the enemy did and what chaos we can cause!\n\n**Recap of Last Move:**\nMy Head: Moved from (3, 7) to (4, 7). (My snake is size 1, Head only)\nSnake #1 Head: Was (9, 8) in the prior state (since they ate an apple last turn, they grew to size 3). Let's use the board state provided for Turn 3 analysis!\n\n**Analyzing Current Board State (Turn 3):**\nMy Head: (4, 7). Length 1.\nEnemy Head (#1): (9, 8). Body: [(9, 7)]. Length 2 (Wait, board shows 1 apple for them, so length 2: Head at (9, 8), Body at (9, 7). Let's re-read the opponent description: Body: [(9, 7)]. This means they are Size 2 (Head + 1 body segment). Okay, Size 2 vs Size 1. Still an immediate size disadvantage!\n\n**Movement Analysis based on Previous Picks (Simultaneous):**\n\n1.  **MY Move (Turn 2): RIGHT.**\n    *   My Head moved from (3, 7) -> **(4, 7)**. This aims for the center, closer to apple (7, 7).\n2.  **ENEMY Move (Turn 2):** The last rationale mentioned, \"If I go **RIGHT (4, 7)**, what will Snake #1 do... Option A: LEFT (8, 7)... Option B: UP (9, 8)\". Since their head is now at (9, 8), they MUST have chosen **UP** last turn!\n    *   Enemy Head moved from (9, 7) -> **(9, 8)**. Their body is now (9, 7).\n\n**Current Positions for Turn 3 Planning:**\n*   **ME (0):** Head at (4, 7). Body: None. Danger zone is the body I just vacated (3, 7), which is safe since I'm size 1.\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Head at (9, 8). Body: [(9, 7)]. They are higher up, near the top-right corner apple (9, 9).\n\n**Threat Assessment & Apple Hunting:**\nI successfully moved into a slightly more central position! That apple at (7, 7) is now only 3 steps away (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7).\n\nThe enemy is high on the wall. This is excellent for us! We can attack the center mass without worrying about immediate head-on collision unless they drop down significantly.\n\n**My Options from (4, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** Moves towards (0, 8) and (8, 8). Safe, keeps pressure on the center.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 6):** Retreats slightly, gaining room to maneuver horizontally below the current axis. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):** Retreating to the exact spot I just left. Waste of tempo.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** **The Greedy Line!** This puts me one step closer to apple (7, 7)!\n\n**Enemy Prediction from (9, 8):**\nThe enemy is close to apple (9, 9). They will almost certainly move UP to (9, 9) or LEFT towards (8, 8) if they think I'm diving for the center.\n\n*   If they go **UP (9, 9)**: They eat the apple! Size 3. They secure the corner.\n*   If they go **LEFT (8, 8)**: They move towards the center line, challenging me for the upper quadrant.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT (5, 7)**, I am totally dedicated to getting that first apple here!\n\n*   If Enemy goes UP to (9, 9): I go DOWN next turn (5, 6) or RIGHT again (6, 7). I will definitely eat (7, 7) next turn! I get size 2!\n*   If Enemy goes LEFT to (8, 8): We are now near the center. I am at (5, 7), they are at (8, 8). Still safe. I can still push for (6, 7) next turn.\n\nThis feels like the right time to capitalize on growth! We need size to fight their initial lead! Going RIGHT again puts MAXIMUM pressure on grabbing (7, 7) next turn, forcing the enemy to decide whether to chase us or secure their corner apple! If they go for the corner, we dominate the center mass quickly!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** We are prioritizing growth over direct engagement right now because we are smaller. If we can eat two apples before they can wall us off, we gain the size advantage and then we can look for the aggressive box-out! Position (5, 7) sets up a clean path to (7, 7) via (6, 7). No immediate danger from the enemy's path at (9, 8). LET'S GO GET THAT FOOD!\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break this down with game sense.\n\n**STATUS CHECK:**\n- Me: Head at (9,8), body at (9,7), length 2, 1 apple\n- Enemy: Head at (4,7), body: none, 0 apples\n- Board is getting crowded with apples! (9,9) is RIGHT above me - that's a free apple if I can grab it safely.\n\n**SAFETY ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**\nMy possible moves from (9,8):\n- UP to (9,9): Contains an apple! Empty board-wise. Safe if no collision.\n- DOWN to (9,7): MY BODY. DEAD. \u274c\n- LEFT to (8,8): Empty board-wise. Safe.\n- RIGHT: Out of bounds (x=10 doesn't exist). DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo I have UP and LEFT as safe options.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (4,7) is 5 steps away horizontally. He's probably thinking about apples like (8,8) or (9,9) on the right side, but he's too far to beat me to (9,9) unless he gets lucky.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go UP to (9,9) and he somehow decides to go RIGHT and UP... wait, he can't reach (9,9) this turn. He's at (4,7). Even going RIGHT to (5,7) then UP... no, he moves simultaneously this turn only. So collision at (9,9) is impossible this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY - THE BOX IN:**\nHere's the play: I need to claim the RIGHT SIDE aggressively. (9,9) gives me +1 apple, length 3, and positions me at the top-right corner. From there, I can:\n- Move LEFT across the top row (9,8) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 etc.\n- Or DOWN the right column to trap him\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy is stuck on the left side. With my increased length, if he ever tries to challenge me head-on... HE DIES. I win because I have more apples + length.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 4: If I get (9,9), I'll be at top-right corner. Next move should be LEFT to (8,9) or DOWN to (9,8) depending on where enemy moves. Goal: Create a wall between me and him, force him into the bottom-left corner where he'll run out of space.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nUP to (9,9)! Free apple, +1 point, I grow to length 3, and I claim the most valuable corner. Enemy can't touch me. This is how you dominate the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Let's assume they ate the apple at (9, 9).\n*   **Revised Enemy State (If they ate (9, 9)):** Head (9, 9). Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. Apples: 3. Length 3. (Wait, the scoreboard says 2 apples for them. This means they DID NOT eat (9, 9) resulting in 3 apples. They must have moved somewhere else, or the board state given for Turn 4 reflects that they *did not* eat (9, 9) last turn if their score is still 2! Let's trust the provided board state and scoreboard!)\n\n**Trusting the Provided Board State for Turn 4:**\n*   ME: Head (5, 7). Score 1.\n*   ENEMY #1: Head (9, 9). Body [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. Score 2.\n    *   *AHA! The board shows their head is at (9, 9)!* This confirms they moved UP and ATE the apple at (9, 9) last turn!\n    *   If they ate an apple, their score should be 3 (from the initial 2 + 1 more). BUT the scoreboard says Score 2! This is a contradiction in the data provided by the game state vs the score display! **I MUST prioritize the BOARD STATE representation over the written scoreboard summary, as the board reflects the actual physical location.** If their head is at (9, 9), they ate it!\n\n**ASSUMPTION BASED ON VISUAL BOARD:** Snake #1 ate the apple at (9, 9) last turn. Their snake length is T-H-B: (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7). Length 3. Score 3 (LOGICALLY). I will proceed assuming they are bigger and more dangerous, even though the text says Score 2 (maybe apples are counted before growth?).\n\n**My Plan for Turn 4:**\nI am at (5, 7). Apple (7, 7) is the jackpot! I need one more step RIGHT to (6, 7), and then I get it next turn!\n\n**My 4 Safe Moves from (5, 7):**\n1.  **UP (5, 8):** Safe. Keeps distance from their high wall position.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 6):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 7):** Retreating. No tempo.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 7):** **The Aggressive Growth Play!** Puts me directly in line for the (7, 7) apple next turn.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction from (9, 9):**\nThey are now in the corner! They have almost no room to maneuver on the top edge (Y=9). They will likely move DOWN or LEFT to gain space OR move toward the next apple near them, (8, 8).\n\n*   If they go **DOWN (9, 8):** They are heading toward my central territory! Danger increases.\n*   If they go **LEFT (8, 9):** They are trying to widen their base.\n\n**Collision Risk Analysis (If I go RIGHT to (6, 7)):**\n*   My new position: (6, 7).\n*   If Enemy goes DOWN to (9, 8): No intersection, we are far apart (x-distance is 3). Safe!\n*   If Enemy goes LEFT to (8, 9): No intersection (y-distance is 2). Safe!\n\nGoing RIGHT is MAXIMUM VALUE! It sets up guaranteed growth next turn if the enemy doesn't wall me off perfectly, and right now, they are too far away in the corner to do that! We NEED size! We are behind in points! Grow or die!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Continue aggressive pursuit of apples to equalize size difference. Focus exclusively on reaching (7, 7) next turn. Do not deviate unless absolutely necessary (like an immediate self-destruct or opponent closing gap faster than expected). We are hunting!\n\nI see the path, Chat! We MUST take the road that leads to food!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down the board state with that WINNING MINDSET! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**STATUS CHECK:**\n- **ME (Snake #1):** Head at (9,9), Body: [(9,8), (9,7)], Apples: 2 (JUST ATE ONE!). Length: 3.\n- **ENEMY (Snake #0):** Head at (5,7), Body: [(4,7)], Apples: 1. Length: 2.\n- **BOARD:** 15 apples on the board. I'm currently leading 2-1 in apples. THIS IS MY CHANCE TO RUN AWAY WITH THE LEAD!\n\n**CRITICAL SAFETY ANALYSIS:**\nMy current head is at (9,9) - the TOP-RIGHT CORNER. This is a DEAD END if I'm not careful. Let's see my possible moves:\n- **DOWN to (9,8):** WAIT! That's my OWN BODY (segment 1). That's SUICIDE! \u274c DEAD.\n- **LEFT to (8,9):** Check the board... (8,9) is empty (board shows (8,9) as a dot). SAFE move.\n- **UP/RIGHT:** Out of bounds! x=10 or y=10 don't exist. DEATH. \u274c\n\nSo my ONLY SAFE move is **LEFT to (8,9)**. I have NO OTHER OPTION if I want to stay alive! This is actually perfect - it keeps me in the game and away from my own tail.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 is at (5,7) with body at (4,7). He's 4 squares away horizontally from me. He can't reach me this turn even if he tries. He's probably eyeing apples like (7,7) or (8,8), but he's way too far to threaten me.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (8,9) and he somehow goes RIGHT... no, he's at (5,7). Even if he goes RIGHT to (6,7), he's still 3 squares away from me. We're safe from collision. No worries!\n\n**STRATEGY - THE BOX IN:**\nHere's my master plan: I just claimed the top-right corner. Now I need to spiral DOWN and LEFT to cut off the enemy from the right side of the board. By moving to (8,9), I'm:\n1. Staying alive (crucial!)\n2. Positioning myself to move DOWN along the right side\n3. Creating a wall between me and the enemy\n4. Keeping apples like (9,2), (8,1), (8,0) in my territory\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nTurn 4: Move LEFT to (8,9).\nTurn 5: Move DOWN to (8,8) (there's an apple there!).\nTurn 6: Move DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8) depending on enemy movement.\n\nI'm creating a \"fence\" on the right side. The enemy will be forced into the bottom-left section, where he'll run out of space as the game progresses. With my length advantage (3 vs 2), if he ever challenges me head-on... HE DIES and I WIN. \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI have no choice but **LEFT** to (8,9) to stay alive, and it actually sets up my next move perfectly. This is how you control the board! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We *must* eat or we will get boxed out of existence!\n\n**Current State Check (Turn 5):**\n*   **ME (0):** Head: (6, 7). Body: [(5, 7)]. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Head: (9, 9). Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. Length 3. Apples: 2 (Scoreboard lied, but geometry says they grew last turn!).\n\n**Last Move Review:** We went RIGHT to (6, 7)! A PERFECT play setting us up for the (7, 7) apple!\n\n**Apple Target:** (7, 7) is RIGHT THERE! One move away!\n\n**Enemy Prediction (What will Snake #1 do from (9, 9)?):**\nSnake #1 is sitting in the absolute top-right corner. They have two immediate threats:\n1.  **GO DOWN:** (9, 8) - Their body cell! If they move DOWN, they would be placing their head where their body segment was. **CRUCIAL CHECK:** If they move DOWN to (9, 8), they would be replacing their own tail piece (if they didn't eat last turn, which they *did* according to the board setup) OR they are just backing into their body if their length is 3. Let's check the board: Enemy Body is [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. If they move DOWN to (9, 8), they crash into their own segment at (9, 8)! **Wait, no. Bodies shift.** If they move DOWN to (9, 8), their tail segment at (9, 7) falls off *unless* they ate. Since the board shows they have 3 segments, they ATE last turn. Therefore, their new tail will be (9, 7) UNLESS they move onto a position already occupied by their own body, which would kill them *unless* it's the tail cell they are about to vacate.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (9, 8): This is where their *previous* head was. If they didn't eat, they would die by moving onto (9, 8) because (9, 8) is now part of their body! This is a self-collision risk if they *didn't* eat the apple last turn. But the board shows they *did* eat (9, 9), meaning their body is length 3: Head (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7).\n    *   If they move DOWN to (9, 8), they are moving onto their own segment at (9, 8). **THIS IS A SUICIDE MOVE if their movement model is standard (you cannot move onto a non-tail body segment).** They must move LEFT or UP.\n\n2.  **GO LEFT:** (8, 9). This is the only safe direction that keeps them on the edge and expands their zone.\n3.  **GO UP:** (9, 10) - OFF THE BOARD! Dead snake!\n\n**Conclusion on Enemy Move:** Snake #1 is highly constrained. They are almost certainly moving **LEFT to (8, 9)** to secure space along the top wall, or they miscalculated their move last turn and might attempt a suicide move if they thought they could move DOWN (which is unlikely for a good player). We must assume they go LEFT to (8, 9).\n\n**My Plan for Turn 5 (From (6, 7)):**\nI have two critical objectives:\n1.  **EAT THE APPLE (7, 7)!** This is the highest priority to gain size parity.\n2.  **AVOID (8, 9)** if the enemy moves there.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**:\n*   My New Head: (7, 7). I EAT! I grow! My new tail will be (6, 7).\n*   Collision Check: Enemy moves to (8, 9). My head at (7, 7) is safe!\n*   **This is IT. Guaranteed point and growth!**\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 8), DOWN to (6, 6), or LEFT to (5, 7): I miss the apple, and the enemy gets an entire turn to expand their territory uncontested! NO CHANCE! We must capitalize on this setup!\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:** We are now eating! We need to use this growth to start closing off the top-right corner where the opponent is trapped. Use our increased size to build a barrier forcing them down the side walls where they have significantly less maneuverability than us in the open center. Size advantage is coming!\n\nMove (6, 7) -> RIGHT -> (7, 7) and GROW! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

I'm winning 2-1.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (My possible moves from (8,9)):**\n1. **UP (8,10):** Out of bounds! DEATH. \u274c\n2. **RIGHT (9,9):** That's my BODY! Segment 1. DEATH. \u274c\n3. **DOWN (8,8):** Board shows (8,8) = A (APPLE!). Empty of snakes. SAFE! \u2705\n4. **LEFT (7,9):** Board shows (7,9) = . (dot). Empty. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 at (6,7) with body (5,7). He's moving this turn too. Where can he go?\n- Possible moves: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7) is BODY, RIGHT (7,7) is Apple!\n- He's likely going for (7,7) apple or (6,8). Either way, he's still far from me.\n\n**STRATEGY - THE TRAP SETTING:**\nI have TWO safe moves. Which is better?\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (8,8)** \n- Grab that apple! +1 point, +1 length. Now I'm 3 apples vs his 1.\n- BUT: (8,8) puts me in a tricky spot. From there, I can only go LEFT (7,8) or DOWN (8,7). That's only 2 options.\n- I'd be boxing myself in slightly.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (7,9)**\n- NO apple. Stays at 2 apples.\n- BUT: From (7,9), I have BETTER position: DOWN (7,8) is empty, LEFT (6,9) is empty, RIGHT (8,9) is... my own tail (but tail moves! Might be safe later). \n- This keeps me on the TOP ROW, giving me more space to maneuver and control the upper half of the board.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nChat, I'm playing for CONTROL, not just apples. If I take the apple now at (8,8), I commit to a narrow path. If I go LEFT to (7,9), I keep my options OPEN and maintain board control. I can grab that apple LATER when it's safer.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **LEFT** to (7,9) to maintain flexibility and control the top row. I'll outmaneuver him and claim apples on MY terms!\n\nLEFT",

I must trust the visual board representation entirely for the current state (Turn 6).\n\n**Current Reality (Turn 6 Start):**\n*   **ME (0):** Head: (7, 7). Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 3. Positioned centrally/lower right.\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Head: (7, 9). Body: [(8, 9), (9, 9)]. Length 3. Trapped RIGHT against the top wall! This is HUGE!\n\nIf they are at (7, 9) with body sections behind them at (8, 9) and (9, 9), this means their previous head must have been at (7, 8) and they moved UP, OR they were at (8, 9) and moved LEFT, OR they were at (6, 9) and moved RIGHT (but that would put their body elsewhere).\n\n**Let's assume they moved UP from (7, 8) to (7, 9) and DID NOT eat, because their score is still 2 apples.** (If they didn't eat, their body segment (9, 9) would have fallen off, but it's still there! This means the board implies they EITHER moved to a body segment and somehow survived, OR the opponent DID eat an apple since Turn 5, but the score didn't update, OR my previous deduction about their previous position was wildly off).\n\n**Forget the past! Focus NOW!** They are cornered at the top by row 9! Their only escape vectors are DOWN (to (7, 8)) or LEFT (to (6, 9)). They cannot move RIGHT (off-board) or UP (off-board).\n\n**MY GOALS:**\n1.  Grow Bigger!\n2.  Box them in further! Box them into the top-right corner!\n\n**Available Apples:** (0, 8), (8, 8), (7, 2), (8, 1), (3, 0), (5, 1), (6, 6), (0, 3), (0, 7), (9, 2), (3, 9), (3, 4), (8, 0), (2, 0), (1, 7).\n\nThe closest/most useful apple seems to be **(8, 8)** or **(1, 7)**. (8, 8) is very close to the enemy!\n\n**Analyzing Opponent's Likely Move (Enemy at (7, 9)):**\nIf they go DOWN to (7, 8), they are hitting empty space. This opens up the top wall structure for them.\nIf they go LEFT to (6, 9), they move into empty space along the top wall.\n\nWe have the positional advantage now! We are perfectly placed to start walling off the top right.\n\n**My Options from (7, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** This directly aims towards the enemy's position and the (8, 8) apple. If I go UP, and they go DOWN to (7, 8), we **COLLIDE** and both die! **DANGER!**\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safer move. Moves me towards the right edge and closer to that juicy (8, 8) apple.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Drifts me away from the action unnecessarily.\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Moves me away from the edge, reversing the growth path slightly.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 7)**:\n*   Enemy is very likely to move to (7, 8) to escape the corner or (6, 9) to run along the top.\n*   If they go (7, 8): I am safe at (8, 7). I can aim for (8, 8) next turn.\n*   If they go (6, 9): I am safe at (8, 7). I can aim for (8, 8) next turn.\n\nIf I go **UP to (7, 8)**:\n*   If they go DOWN to (7, 8): **DOUBLE KO!** We both die! We both have 2 apples, so it's a draw if we both die! We are playing to WIN, not draw! We must avoid this collision path!\n\n**Conclusion:** Going UP is too aggressive and risks a draw immediately when we have positional upper hand! We need to secure growth or safe territory. Moving to (8, 7) positions me perfectly to attack the (8, 8) apple next turn, while keeping me away from their escape route (7, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the (8, 8) apple next turn. This forces the enemy to either commit further into the already cramped top-right corner or flee downwards prematurely, allowing us to use our superior central position to dominate the board going forward. We must leverage their confinement!\n\nStrategy Note: Keep maximizing size and restrict enemy movement. Do not allow them any open space on the top edge. Right movement seems best to facilitate attack on (8, 8) while maintaining safety from the immediate collision point (7, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down the battlefield.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- **ME:** Head (7,9), Body: [(8,9), (9,9)], Apples: 2\n- **ENEMY:** Head (7,7), Body: [(6,7), (5,7)], Apples: 2\n- **BOARD:** 15 apples. Tie game. CRUNCH TIME.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (From Head (7,9)):**\n1. **UP (7,10):** Out of bounds! DEATH. \u274c\n2. **DOWN (7,8):** Board says it's an apple (A)! No snake body. SAFE. \u2705\n3. **LEFT (6,9):** Board says it's empty (.)! SAFE. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT (8,9):** My own body segment! DEATH. \u274c\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy at (7,7). He's moving too. Where can he go?\n- UP (7,8): APPLE! Very likely target. His length is 3 (2 body segments).\n- DOWN (7,6): Empty.\n- LEFT (6,7): His own body! DEATH if he goes there.\n- RIGHT (8,7): Empty.\n\n**THE TRAP (HEAD-ON COLLISION SETUP):**\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), I grab the apple. If the enemy moves UP to (7,8) for that same apple...\n**BOOM! HEAD-ON COLLISION.**\nWho wins? We have the SAME score (2 apples). The rules say:\n*\"If two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"*\n*\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"*\n\nThis is a **DRAW** scenario. I don't want a draw. I want the WIN. I need to outsmart him.\n\n**THE STRATEGY - MIND GAMES:**\nI cannot risk the 50/50 collision if he sees the same apple. I need to secure a guaranteed win or a better position.\n*Wait.* Let's look at the board again.\n(7,8) is an apple. (8,8) is also an apple (from the list).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I eat the apple. I grow. I move to (7,8).\nBut what if I go LEFT to (6,9)?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9):\n- I don't eat an apple. Score stays 2-2.\n- I move away from the immediate collision zone.\n- Where is the enemy likely going? He sees an apple at (7,8). He likely moves UP.\n- If he moves UP to (7,8) and I am at (6,9), we don't collide.\n- Then, on the NEXT turn, I will be at (6,9). The enemy will be at (7,8) (assuming he took the apple).\n- From (6,9), I can move DOWN to (6,8) or RIGHT to (7,9).\n- I want to *steal* his position or cut him off.\n\nActually, let's reconsider the collision. If we both go for the apple at (7,8), it's a draw. But if I stay back...\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9):\n- Enemy goes UP to (7,8) (eating apple). Score becomes Enemy 3 - Me 2. **I am losing.** Not ideal.\n\nOkay, let's look at the board again.\nThere is an apple at (8,8).\nMy head is at (7,9).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I eat the apple. Score 3-2.\nIf Enemy goes UP to (7,8), we collide -> Draw.\nBut if Enemy doesn't go UP? If he goes RIGHT to (8,7) or DOWN to (7,6)?\nThen I eat the apple safely and grow.\n\nIs there a safer way to win?\nLet's look at my body. (8,9) and (9,9).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), my tail (9,9) moves. The cell (9,9) becomes empty.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9), my tail moves.\n\n**The Winning Move:**\nI need to force a win.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6,9):\n- I am safe.\n- Enemy likely goes UP to (7,8) for the apple.\n- Score: Enemy 3 - Me 2.\n- Now I am at (6,9). Enemy is at (7,8).\n- On the next turn, I can go DOWN to (6,8).\n- Enemy might be distracted. But he is growing.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (7,8):\n- I eat the apple. Score 3-2.\n- If Enemy goes UP (7,8) -> Draw.\n- If Enemy goes elsewhere -> I win the trade.\n\nWait, look at the board state again.\n` 9 . . . A . . . 1 T T`\n` 8 A . . . . . . . A .`\n` 7 A A . . . T T 0 . .`\n\nEnemy is at (7,7). I am at (7,9).\nThe space between us is (7,8).\n(7,8) is an apple.\nIf I take it, and he takes it, it's a draw.\nBut if I don't take it, he likely takes it.\nIf he takes it and I don't, he grows. He wins 3-2.\n\nI need to prevent him from getting that apple safely.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I am making a statement.\nIs there a way to win the collision?\nRules: *\"If two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"*\n*\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"*\n\nWe both have 2 apples. Collision = Draw.\nI cannot win a collision today. I must avoid it.\n\nSo, if I can't win the collision, I must **OUTMANEUVER**.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9), I am safe. He likely goes UP to (7,8). He gets the point.\nScore: 3-2. He leads.\nNow, I am at (6,9). He is at (7,8).\nI am one step away from his new head position.\nNext turn, I can attack. But he is growing.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN to (7,8) and he goes UP to (7,8)? Draw.\nWhat if I go DOWN to (7,8) and he goes RIGHT to (8,7)?\nI eat the apple. Score 3-2. I grow.\nHe misses the apple.\nThis is a WIN for me.\n\nWhy would he go RIGHT?\nMaybe he's scared of the collision?\nMaybe he sees the apple at (8,1)? No, that's too far.\nMaybe he sees (8,7) is empty.\n\nLet's look at his possible moves from (7,7):\n1. UP (7,8): Apple. High value.\n2. DOWN (7,6): Empty.\n3. LEFT (6,7): His body. Death.\n4. RIGHT (8,7): Empty.\n\nHe has 3 safe moves. One is an apple.\nHe wants apples. He will likely go UP.\nIf he goes UP, and I go DOWN, it's a draw.\nI don't want a draw. I want to win.\n\nSo I should NOT go DOWN (7,8) if I think he goes UP.\nI should go LEFT (6,9).\nBut if I go LEFT (6,9), and he goes UP (7,8), he leads 3-2.\nThen I am at (6,9).\nFrom (6,9), I can go DOWN (6,8).\nFrom (7,8), he can go UP (7,9) or LEFT (6,8) or RIGHT (8,8).\nIf he goes LEFT (6,8) and I go DOWN (6,8), collision. We would both be at 3 apples (he ate one). Draw again.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\nLet's look at the board again.\nThere is an apple at (8,8).\nMy head is at (7,9).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I am sandwiched between Enemy (7,7) and the wall (7,10).\nActually, (7,10) is out of bounds.\nSo if I go DOWN to (7,8), I have:\n- UP (7,9) -> My body (8,9)? No, (7,9) is currently empty (I moved from there).\nWait. My body is [(8,9), (9,9)].\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), my tail (9,9) moves.\nMy new body will be [(7,9), (8,9)].\nSo from (7,8), I can go UP to (7,9) (safe, my body will move), LEFT (6,8), or RIGHT (8,8).\nRIGHT (8,8) is an apple!\nSo if I go DOWN to (7,8):\n1. I eat the apple at (7,8). Score 3-2.\n2. If Enemy goes UP to (7,8) -> Draw.\n3. If Enemy goes elsewhere -> I am at (7,8) with an apple, and I see another apple at (8,8).\n\nThis looks like the best aggressive play.\nIs there a way to guarantee I don't die?\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9):\n- I am safe.\n- I don't score.\n- I let the enemy score.\n\nIn a tie game, letting the enemy score is bad.\nI must fight for the apple.\nIf it's a draw, it's a draw. But if he hesitates, I win.\nMaybe he will go for the apple at (8,8) instead?\nNo, (8,8) is further from him. He is at (7,7). (7,8) is closer.\n\nWait, let's look at the apple list again.\n(0, 8), (8, 8), (7, 2)...\nThere is an apple at (8,8)!\nMy head is at (7,9).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I am one step away from (8,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9), I am far from (8,8).\n\nLet's consider the \"Ruthless Competitor\" persona.\nI want to force a head-on collision if I have a higher score.\nI don't have a higher score (2-2).\nSo I should avoid collision if possible.\nBUT, if I take the apple (7,8), my score becomes 3-2.\nThen if he collides with me next turn, *I* win.\n\nSo the plan:\n1. Go DOWN to (7,8).\n2. Eat the apple. Score 3-2.\n3. Hope he doesn't collide this turn (if he does, it's a draw, which is okay, I survive).\n4. If he doesn't collide, I am at (7,8) with an apple, dominating the center.\n\nIs (7,8) a trap?\nFrom (7,8), I have neighbors:\n- UP (7,9): Empty (I just left it).\n- LEFT (6,8): Empty.\n- RIGHT (8,8): Apple!\n- DOWN (7,7): Enemy head (if he doesn't move).\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (7,8), and Enemy goes UP to (7,8), we collide. Draw.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), and Enemy goes RIGHT to (8,7)?\nThen I am at (7,8). He is at (8,7).\nDistance between us is 1.\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (8,8) (eating apple). He might go UP to (8,8) or LEFT (7,7).\nIf he goes UP to (8,8), we collide. I win 3-2.\n\nThis is getting messy. Let's simplify.\nI am at (7,9).\nMoves:\n- UP: Death.\n- RIGHT: Death (Body).\n- LEFT (6,9): Safe. Empty. No apple.\n- DOWN (7,8): Apple. Safe (no body).\n\nThe only place I can gain points is DOWN.\nIf I go LEFT, I stagnate.\nIf I go DOWN, I risk a collision.\nBut in Snake, if you don't eat, you die eventually.\nI have to eat.\n\nIs there any other factor?\nThe board is 10x10.\nMy body is at (8,9) and (9,9).\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), my tail moves from (9,9) to (8,9).\nMy body becomes [(7,9), (8,9)].\nThis looks fine.\n\nLet's trust the aggression.\nIf the enemy is at (7,7), he has 4 directions.\nHe is likely to chase the closest apple.\nClosest apple to (7,7) is (7,8).\nIf he goes for (7,8), and I go for (7,8), it's a draw.\nIf he goes for (7,8), and I go LEFT, he gets the point.\nI cannot let him get the point in a tie game.\n\nSo I will go DOWN.\nIf he crashes into me, we draw. I stay alive.\nIf he doesn't, I score.\n\nWait, I see an apple at (8,8) in the board list.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I can pivot to (8,8) next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,9), I am moving away from the apples.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\nIt's the only move that gives me a chance to increase my lead.\nIf he mirrors me, we draw. That's acceptable risk.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm diving for the apple at (7,8) to seize the lead! If he wants to collide, we draw. If he's scared, I eat and grow. LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

Positioned to strike!\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Head: (7, 9). Body: [(8, 9), (9, 9)]. Length 3. Trapped near the top wall (rows 8 and 9).\n\n**My Options from (7, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** DANGEROUS! If they go DOWN to (7, 8), it's a simultaneous collision! We both die! A 2-2 draw? NO THANK YOU! We want the WIN! Must AVOID (7, 8) as their likely move is to escape via (7, 8).\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Moves towards the valuable apple at (8, 8). Keeps me safe if they drop to (7, 8).

If they do this, my RIGHT move to (8, 7) is PERFECT.\n*   **Move B: LEFT to (6, 9).** They run along the top wall.

My immediate next goal will be to cut off the path between (7, 7) and (7, 9) to really seal them into that top right quadrant, perhaps moving UP from (8, 8) if possible, or moving LEFT towards (7, 8) now that the immediate threat is less volatile.

I just left it, but my tail hasn't moved yet in this upcoming turn? No, wait. The tail moves *simultaneously*. But (7,9) is currently occupied by my body.\n    *   *Crucial Rule Check:* If I go UP, I move into (7,9). My tail is at (8,9) or (9,9)? My body is [(7,9), (8,9)]. So (7,9) is definitely occupied. **DEATH.** \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (7,7):** Empty (Enemy was there, but he moved to (8,7)). **SAFE.** \u2705\n3.  **LEFT (6,8):** Empty. **SAFE.** \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT (8,8):** APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (From the list). **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (At 8,7):**\nHe is trailing. He needs an apple.\nNeighbors of (8,7):\n1.  **UP (8,8):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **DOWN (8,6):** Empty.\n3.  **LEFT (7,7):** Empty (He just left it).\n4.  **RIGHT (9,7):** Empty.\n\n**THE KILLING BLOW STRATEGY:**\nI am leading 3-2. I have the positional advantage and I see an apple at **(8,8)**.\nThe enemy sees the same apple at **(8,8)**.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,8) and he goes UP to (8,8), we collide.\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION.**\nWho wins?\n*   Me: 3 Apples.\n*   Him: 2 Apples.\n*   **Rule:** If all snakes die, the one with **more apples wins**.\n*   **Result:** **I WIN.**\n\nThis is the perfect trap. I am already winning. If he greedily goes for the apple I am aiming for, he loses the game immediately.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE MOVES:**\n*   **LEFT (6,8):** Safe, but passive. I lose sight of the apple at (8,8). He might take it. I stay at 3 apples, he gets to 3. Risky.\n*   **DOWN (7,7):** Safe, but no apple. I stay at 3. He might take (8,8). He gets to 3. Risky.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am going **RIGHT** to (8,8).\nI am claiming the apple.\nI am daring him to collide.\nIf he collides, I win.\nIf he retreats (moves DOWN or LEFT), I eat the apple, grow to 4, and extend my lead to 4-2.\n\nThis is the ultimate aggression. I am putting the ball in his court. Do you want to die, rival?\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAssuming I eat the apple at (8,8) and survive:\n*   My head will be at (8,8).\n*   My body will be [(7,8), (7,9)].\n*   I need to check if (8,9) is safe (currently my body is there, but it moves).\n*   I will look for the next apple to keep the pressure on. I am the hunter now.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, WE ARE LIVE AND THE SCOREBOARD IS LOOKING SPICY! Snake #1 is up 3-2! We need to make a move that not only avoids death but secures us some sweet, sweet growth to close that gap! We just moved RIGHT last turn to (8, 7). Let's see the fallout!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 8 Start):**\n*   **ME (0):** Head: (8, 7). Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. Length 4 (+1 from the apple at (8, 8) if I got it, WAIT, I didn't get an apple at (8, 8) last turn based on the board state! Let's re-verify the movement and growth mechanics based on the provided board state for Turn 8).\n\n**RE-EVALUATING BOARD STATE VS LAST RATIONALE:**\nMy last move was RIGHT to (8, 7).\nMy previous head was (7, 7). My body was [(6, 7), (5, 7)].\nSnake #1 Head was (7, 9). Body was [(8, 9), (9, 9)].\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 7), and the enemy moves simultaneously:\nIf Snake #1 moved DOWN to (7, 8) (most logical escape):\nMy new head is (8, 7). Their new head is (7, 8). No collision.\nDid either of us eat an apple?\nApples near me: (8, 8) was an apple.\nIf I move to (8, 7), I'm NOT eating apple (8, 8).\nIf Snake #1 moves to (7, 8), they are NOT eating apple (8, 8).\n\n**CRITICAL BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nThe board shows:\nYour snake (ID 0): Head (9, 7), Body [(8, 7), (7, 7)]. Length 3. Apples: 2. (This implies my move to (8, 7) was perhaps not the first move of this turn, or the board displays the state *after* their move but only *before* mine, or the growth didn't happen based on the previous turn's action relative to that apple! Given the prompt says \"Turn: 8 / 150,\" we must trust the displayed board state as the starting point for MY move selection this turn.)\n\n**Trust the Board State Provided for Turn 8:**\n*   **ME (0):** Head: (9, 7). Body: [(8, 7), (7, 7)]. Length 3. I am currently BOXED in the TOP RIGHT CORNER! This is BAD!\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Head: (8, 8). Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. Length 4. They have more length and are in a dominant position near me! Score is 3-2 them leading!\n\n**OMG CHAT! My EPIC flanking maneuver from last turn DID NOT LEAD TO THE IDEAL BOARD STATE!** That means the enemy reacted perfectly, or my assumption about my last move *resulting* in the current state was flawed, or the board state shown is the **RESULT** of *Turn 7*: If my last move was RIGHT (7, 7 -> 8, 7), and their last move resulted in them being at (8, 8) and me being at (9, 7), something chaotic happened involving growth or collision I must account for based on this *new* reality!\n\nSince the board state IS the reality we deal with: I am TRAPPED at (9, 7)! I have three options to escape this corner: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**My Options from (9, 7):**\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** Board edge collision! INSTANT DEATH! **NO!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** Safe move off the edge. Opens up some space, but I'm still very constricted.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** Moves me adjacent to my own tail, and crucially, puts me right next to the enemy head at (8, 8)! This is a direct confrontation!\n\n**Enemy Head Position:** (8, 8).\n**Enemy Body:** [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)].\n\n**Analyzing Potential Collisions with Enemy Head at (8, 8): SHARP FOCUS!**\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (8, 7):** New Head (8, 7). Enemy Head (8, 8) moves simultaneously.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7): **HEAD-ON COLLISION! We BOTH DIE! Draw situation! I want the WIN! AVOID.**\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (9, 8): They move off the board! They die! **I WIN!** (Unlikely move for them, they have a body behind them).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 8): Board edge collision! They die! **I WIN!** (This is the same as UP if they are at 8,8 and the map is 10x10, (9,8) is valid, (9,9) is top right corner). Let's look at their location: (8, 8) is far from the wall.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8): This is safe for them, moving along their body. I survive at (8, 7). This leaves me constrained diagonally from their head.\n\nThe move LEFT to (8, 7) threatens a direct confrontation at (8, 7) if they move DOWN, or forces them to play defensively. It's aggressive, but risky since they lead 3-2!\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (9, 6):** New Head (9, 6). This is safe from the enemy head at (8, 8). I escape the corner. This is the SAFE-AGGRO move. It opens space, but feels too passive when trailing.\n\n*   **If Enemy Predicts My Move:**\n    *   If I go DOWN to (9, 6): They likely move towards the center or up to (9, 8) to cut me off from the top. If they go to (9, 8), they claim the (9, 9) wall space. If they move UP to (8, 9), they eat the letter 'T' next to their body segment, which aligns with (8, 9) on the map legend (T=snake body - wait, the map legend is confusing, T=Snake body segment). Let's look at the board map again.\n    *   Board positions:\n        *   (9, 9) is T (part of Snake 1 body).\n        *   (9, 8) is T (part of Snake 1 body).\n        *   (9, 7) is 0 (My Head).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 6): My head moves away from the enemy cluster. They have the high ground. They will likely move UP to (9, 8) or maybe LEFT to (7, 8) to solidify the top half. If they move UP to (9, 8), they are colliding with their own body segment which is at (8, 9) and (7, 9)! Wait, Snake 1 body is [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)].\nIf Enemy Head (8, 8) moves UP to (8, 9), they hit their own body segment! **ENEMY DIES! I WIN!**\n\n**ENEMY CRITICAL WEAKNESS IDENTIFIED!**\nIf the Enemy Head at (8, 8) moves **UP** to (8, 9), they hit their own body segment! This move is fatal for them!\nIf the Enemy Head at (8, 8) moves **RIGHT** to (9, 8), they hit their own body segment which is shown at (9, 8) as 'T' on the map! Wait, the map shows T at (9, 9) and (9, 8), and (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8).\nLet's confirm Snake 1 structure: Head (8, 8), Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)].\nBoard Check:\n(9,9) = T (Snake 1 Body)\n(8,9) = T (Snake 1 Body)\n(7,9) = T (Snake 1 Body)\n(7,8) = T (Snake 1 Body)\n**Wait, the map shows 4 segments labeled T above row 7!**\n1. (9, 9) T\n2. (8, 9) T\n3. (9, 8) T\n4. (7, 9) T\n5. (7, 8) T\nSnake #1 has 4 segments shown T. Head is at (8, 8). So length should be 5. Score 3 implies length 4 (initial 3 + 1 apple). The board has 5 T's displayed! Let's trust the provided list: Head: (8, 8), Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. Length 4.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 6), I survive safely. What is THEIR move?\nThey see me trapped. They will likely try to seal me off or press aggression.\n*   If they move LEFT to (7, 8): They crash into their own body part (7, 8)! **THEY DIE! I WIN!**\n*   If they move DOWN to (8, 7): They move adjacent to my body, safe.\n*   If they move UP to (8, 9): They crash into their own body part (8, 9)! **THEY DIE! I WIN!**\n\n**CHAT! This enemy snake is HANGING BY A THREAD! Their body segments are positioned such that moving LEFT, RIGHT, or UP from (8, 8) results in self-destruction based on the provided snake list!**\n\nSnake #1 Head is (8, 8). Body is [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)].\nPossible moves from (8, 8):\n1. UP to (8, 9): HITS BODY! Self-kill!\n2. LEFT to (7, 8): HITS BODY! Self-kill!\n3. RIGHT to (9, 8): Safe, not listed in body. (This cell on the map is a T, which implies it should be S1 body, but the list doesn't include it. I MUST trust the list structure over the map characters if they conflict, but let's assume the list is the authority.)\n4. DOWN to (8, 7): Safe, not listed in body.\n\nIf my move DOWN to (9, 6) is SAFE, and their only viable moves are DOWN or RIGHT, or they doom themselves, I win by simply escaping!\n\n**Strategy: Play the SAFE ESCAPE and watch them implode!**\nMy move: DOWN to (9, 6). This keeps me alive, moving away from the cluster, forcing them to make a complex decision where their only \"good\" move is avoiding self-collision, which means moving DOWN to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 8) IF (9, 8) is clear.\n\nIf they move DOWN to (8, 7): My head is (9, 6). I am safe. Score remains 3-2, but they haven't gained length.\nIf they move RIGHT to (9, 8): My head is (9, 6). I am safe.\n\nThis feels too easy, but based on the explicit snake body list vs head position, UP and LEFT are suicide for Snake #1. I will take DOWN and wait for them to self-destruct or play defensively close to their body!\n\nLong Term Plan: Survive this turn, let them move to (8, 7) or (9, 8). If they move to (8, 7), next turn I can move LEFT to (8, 7) and initiate a head-on fight now that I have more space, or keep maneuvering to collect apples. If they move to (9, 8), I can safely move LEFT next turn towards the center mass of apples!\n\nDOWN looks like the cleanest path to victory without risking a draw!\n\nDOWN",

Their body placement around (8, 8) was RICKETY! If they moved UP or LEFT, they were toast!\n\n**Revisiting My Last Move (DOWN):**\nI chose DOWN to (9, 6). This was the perfect, non-confrontational escape! Let's see what Serpent #1 did!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 9 Start):**\n*   **ME (0):** Head: (9, 6). Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7)]. Length 3. Apples: 2. (The board shows my body shrunk by 1 from the previous state [(9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)] to [(9, 7), (8, 7)]. This implies my tail at (7, 7) was dropped, meaning NO APPLE was consumed on Turn 8. Phew, safety first!)\n*   **ENEMY (1):** Score 3. Head: (9, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. Apples: 3.\n    *   Okay, my prediction about their self-destruction was ONLY half right! They didn't move UP or LEFT, which would have killed them. They must have moved RIGHT or DOWN from (8, 8).\n    *   If they moved RIGHT to (9, 8): This is safe, and they are now one step closer to my position (9, 6) diagonally!\n    *   If they moved DOWN to (8, 7): This is also safe, and they are now adjacent to my body segment (8, 7) that *was* there at the start of the turn (wait, my body segment is now (9, 7), (8, 7)... looking at the board provided for Turn 9: Mine is (9, 6) head, (9, 7), (8, 7) body. My tail *must* have moved/dropped). They are now sitting right on top of my OLD movement corridor!\n\n**The New Battleground:**\nI'm at (9, 6). They are at (9, 8). We are separated by one cell (9, 7) which is one of my body segments! This is SCARY! They are trying to box me into the bottom right!\n\n**My Options from (9, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** I move on top of my own body segment! **INSTANT DEATH! NO!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe move. Moves me further away from their head at (9, 8), but keeps me near the bottom wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** Safe move. Moves me into open space, directly threatening the apple at (7, 2), (8, 1), and (3, 0) further out. This breaks containment.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):** OFF THE BOARD! **DEATH! NO!**\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n*   **DOWN to (9, 5):** Passive. They have the upper hand in height (9 vs 6). If I go down, they might move LEFT/RIGHT to (8, 8) or (10, 8) (oops, 9, 8 is their head) or they move to (8, 8) or (9, 9) if safe. If they move LEFT to (8, 8), they are controlling the space behind me. If I just keep moving down, I'm yielding the whole top half! We are losing on score 3-2! We need aggression!\n*   **LEFT to (8, 6):** This is the aggressive move to pivot outwards! I move toward the center of the board and the available apples! If I can make it to (7, 7) or (6, 6) (where an apple is!), I can grow and start controlling the field!\n\n**Enemy Likely Moves from (9, 8) if I go LEFT to (8, 6):**\n*   If they move DOWN to (9, 7): They crash into my body! **THEY DIE! I WIN!**\n*   If they move LEFT to (8, 8): They are flanking/keeping pace. Safe move.\n*   If they move UP to (9, 9): They eat the corner wall. Safe move based on map visualization if (9,9) is clear from their body list [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. On the map, (9,9) is T (body), so moving UP to (9, 9) is **SELF-DEATH!**\n*   If they move RIGHT to (10, 8): Off the board! **THEY DIE!**\n\n**CHAT! Snake #1 is STILL in a minefield!** Moving UP or RIGHT from (9, 8) is suicide due to the board state shown! Their only safe moves are DOWN to (9, 7) (which hits my body!) or LEFT to (8, 8)!\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (8, 6)**:\n1.  If they move LEFT to (8, 8): They survive, but I'm free to keep heading left/down towards apples. This is a good outcome for me.\n2.  If they move DOWN to (9, 7): **THEY DIE HITTING MY BODY! I WIN!**\n\n**This is it! My line of attack! I move LEFT, and if they play slightly defensively (moving LEFT to flank me), I gain space! If they try to pin me by moving DOWN, they suicide onto my existing body segment! This is the best possible scenario!**\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Escape the corner cluster aggressively via LEFT. Keep an eye on (8, 7) and (7, 7) to see if I can eventually trap their head against a wall using my increasing length, or simply outmaneuver them towards the growing number of apples in the center-left! We are closing this 3-2 gap!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**",

I'm in the **VIP box** at **(9,8)**. The enemy is right below me at **(9,7)**.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\n**MY POSITION (9,8):**\n- **UP (9,9):** Empty on the board. \u2705\n- **DOWN (9,7):** Enemy Head. \u274c (DEATH)\n- **LEFT (8,8):** Empty (my body moved from there last turn). \u2705\n- **RIGHT:** Off board. \u274c (DEATH)\n\n**ENEMY POSITION (9,7):**\n- **UP (9,8):** MY HEAD. \u274c\n- **DOWN (9,6):** Empty. \u2705\n- **LEFT (8,7):** His own body. \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** Off board. \u274c\n\n**THE STANDOFF:**\nThe enemy is trapped in a corner just like I was last turn. He has TWO moves: UP (into me) or DOWN (safe).\nI have TWO moves: UP (safe) or LEFT (safe).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI want a head-on collision! I have more apples (3 vs 2), so if we crash, **I WIN**.\nIf I go UP to (9,9), and he goes UP to (9,8), we don't crash (different cells).\nIf I go UP, and he goes DOWN, we are safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (8,8), and he goes UP to (9,8), we don't crash.\nIf I go LEFT, and he goes DOWN, we are safe.\n\n**Wait, if I go UP, I am leaving the line of fire.**\n**If I go LEFT, I am also leaving the line of fire.**\n\nBut... if I go UP to (9,9), I am effectively boxing him in further. I am taking the space directly above him.\nLet's look at his board state if I go UP:\n- He is at (9,7).\n- I am at (9,9).\n- If he goes UP to (9,8), he is sandwiched between my head (9,9) and my potential tail (if I eat an apple? No apple at 9,9). Actually, I'm just sitting there.\n- If he goes DOWN to (9,6), he lives.\n\nLet's look at my board state if I go LEFT to (8,8):\n- I move to (8,8).\n- He is at (9,7).\n- If he goes UP to (9,8), he is safe.\n- If he goes DOWN to (9,6), he is safe.\n\n**Which move gives me more control?**\nIf I go UP to (9,9), I am securing the top right corner. My tail will move to (8,8). I will have a clear path to move LEFT or DOWN next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (8,8), I am moving back into the open board.\n\n**DO I WANT THE FIGHT?**\nYes! I have the score advantage.\nCan I force a fight?\nIf I go UP, I am in his path if he chooses UP.\nIf I go LEFT, I am not in his path.\n**I should go UP to block him and potentially force a collision or limit his space.**\n\nWait, if I go UP to (9,9), and he goes UP to (9,8), we don't collide. We are adjacent.\nIf I go UP, and he goes DOWN to (9,6), we don't collide.\n\nLet's look at the **APPLE AT (9,2)**.\nIf I go UP, I'm moving away from the apple at (9,2).\nIf I go LEFT, I'm moving closer to the apple at (9,2) (via (8,8) -> (8,7) -> etc).\n\n**However, the primary goal is to dominate the board and force the enemy into a mistake.**\nThe enemy has no safe exit to the right. He is pinned against the wall.\nIf I go UP, I continue to pin him against the wall.\nIf I go LEFT, I give him space to potentially wiggle out.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will go **UP** to (9,9).\nWhy?\n1.  It keeps me in the corner, which is a strong defensive/offensive position.\n2.  It maximizes pressure on the enemy.\n3.  My tail moves to (8,8), cleaning up that space.\n4.  Next turn, I can look at the apple at (9,2) or move left into the center.\n\n**Wait, is (9,9) safe?**\nBoard says:\nRow 9: `9 . . . A . A . T T .`\nCoordinates: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(9,9) is the last character in the row. The row shows: `9 . . . A . A . T T .`\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: A\n4: .\n5: A\n6: .\n7: T\n8: T\n9: .\nWait, looking at the board map:\n`9 . . . A . A . T T .`\nIndices 0-9.\n(9,9) is index 9.\nThe character at index 9 is `.` (the space after the last T).\nWait, let's count the characters in the string `9 . . . A . A . T T .`\n1: 9\n2: space\n3: .\n4: space\n5: .\n6: space\n7: .\n8: space\n9: A\n10: space\n11: .\n12: space\n13: A\n14: space\n15: .\n16: space\n17: T\n18: space\n19: T\n20: space\n21: .\nThis is hard to parse. Let's trust the coordinates.\nThe prompt says:\n`9 . . . A . A . T T .`\n`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\nSo:\n(0,9) is `.`\n(1,9) is `.`\n(2,9) is `.`\n(3,9) is `A`\n(4,9) is `.`\n(5,9) is `A`\n(6,9) is `.`\n(7,9) is `T`\n(8,9) is `T`\n(9,9) is `.`\n\nSo (9,9) is EMPTY. It is marked as `.` in the visual.\nHowever, my `YOUR SNAKE` data says my body is at `[(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`.\nWait, last turn I was at (8,8). I moved RIGHT to (9,8).\nMy body before turn 9 was: Head (8,8), Body [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)].\nWait, the prompt for Turn 8 said:\n`Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]`\nSo (8,9) was part of my body.\nBut in Turn 9, the board shows `T` at (8,9) and (9,9)?\nRow 8: `8 A . . . . . . T 1 .`\n(8,8) is 1.\n(8,9) is T.\nRow 9: `9 . . . A . A . T T .`\n(8,9) is T.\n(9,9) is `.`.\nWait, the board shows T at (8,9). So my tail is at (8,9)?\nIf I move UP to (9,9), will I hit my tail at (8,9)? No, that's adjacent.\nWill I hit my body?\nLet's look at the current Turn 9 state provided in the prompt.\n`YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):`\n`Head: (9, 8)`\n`Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`\n`Apples collected: 3`\n\nOkay! The prompt **explicitly** gives the body coordinates for Turn 9.\nMy body is at: (8,8), (7,8), (7,9).\nMy head is at (9,8).\nSo (8,9) is **EMPTY**.\nWhy does the board show 'T' at (8,9)? Maybe it's a visual artifact or a \"ghost\" of where the tail *was* or *will be*? Or maybe it's marking the \"tail area\".\nRegardless, I trust the explicit list: `[(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`.\nSo (8,9) is free.\n(9,9) is free (board shows `.`).\n\nSo **UP to (9,9)** is definitely safe from my own body.\nIs it safe from enemy?\nEnemy is at (9,7). He can't reach (9,9) in one turn.\nIs it safe from Enemy Body?\nEnemy body: `[(9, 7), (8, 7)]`? No, enemy head is (9,6)? Wait.\nPrompt says: `Snake #0 - Head: (9, 6), Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7)], Apples: 2`\nWait, previous turn enemy was at (9,7).\nNow enemy is at (9,6).\nSo he moved DOWN.\nIf he moved DOWN to (9,6), his tail moves from (8,7)? No, he grew?\nWait, did he eat an apple?\nApple list includes (9,2), (3,9), etc. No apple at (9,6).\nSo if he moved from (9,7) to (9,6), his body follows.\nOld body: [(9,7), (8,7)].\nNew Head: (9,6).\nNew Body: [(9,7), (8,7)]? No, the last segment (8,7) drops off?\nWait, apples: 2.\nIf he didn't eat, he doesn't grow.\nSo his new body is just the old head position (9,7).\nWait, the prompt says: `Snake #0 - Head: (9, 6), Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7)]`\nThis implies he grew? Or the list is lagging?\nIf he has 2 apples, and didn't eat this turn, his length is 2 + 2 (initial) = 4?\nOr is it just apple count? \"Snake #0 apples: 2\".\nUsually length = apples + 2 (initial).\nIf he has 2 apples, length is 4.\nHead (9,6).\nBody segment 1: (9,7).\nBody segment 2: (8,7).\nBody segment 3: ??? (Maybe dropped off or not shown if length is 3?).\nWait, the prompt gives `Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7)]`.\nIf length is 4, there should be one more segment.\nMaybe the list is just the visible body parts that matter?\nOr maybe he is length 3? (1 head + 2 body).\nIf he has 2 apples, he is length 4.\nIf the list is missing a segment, it might be (7,7) from previous turns.\nBut for THIS turn, the relevant parts are (9,6) head, and (9,7), (8,7) body.\n(9,6) is his head.\n(9,7) is his body.\n(8,7) is his body.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT FOR UP (9,9):**\n- Own body: (8,8), (7,8), (7,9). Safe.\n- Enemy head: (9,6). Safe.\n- Enemy body: (9,7), (8,7). Safe.\n- Board edge: Safe.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT FOR LEFT (8,8):**\n- Own body: (8,8) is occupied! \u274c **DEATH**.\nWait. `YOUR SNAKE` says `Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`.\nIf I go LEFT to (8,8), I will hit my own body segment.\n**LEFT IS DEATH.**\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT FOR DOWN (9,7):**\n- Enemy head is at (9,6).\n- Enemy body is at (9,7).\n- If I go DOWN to (9,7), I hit enemy body. \u274c **DEATH**.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT FOR RIGHT:**\n- Off board. \u274c **DEATH**.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n**UP (9,9) is the ONLY legal move.**\nLeft is into my own body.\nDown is into enemy body.\nRight is off board.\n\nI have no choice. I must go UP.\nIs UP safe? Yes.\nWill it lead to a win?\nEventually.\nRight now, the enemy is at (9,6).\nIf I go UP to (9,9), I am far away.\nThe enemy is pinned against the wall at (9,6).\nHe can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6).\nI should plan to chase him down.\n\nSince I am forced to go UP, I will do so.\n\n**PLAN:**\nGo UP to (9,9).\nNext turn, I will be at (9,9).\nMy tail will move to (8,8).\nThe enemy is at (9,6).\nI will try to move LEFT to (8,9) or DOWN to (9,8) to chase him.\nWait, if I go UP to (9,9), next turn (9,8) will be empty (my body moves up).\n(8,9) will be empty (my body moves up).\nI will have options to move LEFT or DOWN.\n\nLet's execute the forced move.\n\n**Decision: UP**\n\nFINAL CHECK:\n- Head (9,8) -> UP -> (9,9).\n- (9,9) is empty on board.\n- (9,9) is not in my body list.\n- (9,9) is not enemy head or body.\n- (9,9) is on board.\n\nAll clear.\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're trapped in a corner again, but this time we're the king of the castle! \ud83c\udff0 The only way out is UP! Let's see what the archrival does down there. If he comes up, he dies. If he stays down, we hunt him next turn. LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are BACK for TURN 10! Did you see that calculated explosion I set up last turn? We went LEFT to (8, 6) hoping to capitalize on Snake #1's terrible corner positioning! Let's see the carnage!\n\n**Turn 10 ANALYSIS - THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH:**\n\nMy move: **LEFT to (8, 6)**.\n\nEnemy (#1) Head at (9, 8). Their safe moves were LEFT to (8, 8) or DOWN to (9, 7).\n\n**Scenario 1: Enemy moved DOWN to (9, 7).**\nIf they moved DOWN, they tried to pin me against my own segment at (9, 7). BUT WAIT! My body *was* (9, 7), (8, 7). If they moved to (9, 7), **THEY CRASHED INTO MY BODY! THEY ARE DEAD! WE WIN ON THE SPOT!**\n\n**Scenario 2: Enemy moved LEFT to (8, 8).**\nIf they moved LEFT, they survived and are now flanking me at (8, 8) while I am at (8, 6). This keeps the fight on!\n\n**CHECKING THE BOARD STATE FOR TURN 10!**\nOkay, Chat, let's look at the provided board state for *this* turn (Turn 10). The board shows:\n*   My Head (0): (8, 6) - YES! My move LEFT was successful!\n*   Opponent Head (1): (9, 9) - WHAT?!\n\nThis means one of two things happened:\n1.  **They moved UP to (9, 9) and survived!** BUT WAIT! Looking at the board layout from Turn 9, the cell (9, 9) was marked 'T' (Tail/Body segment for Snake #1)! If (9, 9) was on their body, moving there is IMMEDATE DEATH! **If the board state is accurate, they died moving UP to (9, 9)!!**\n\nLet's re-examine the T's on the board for Snake #1 (Apples: 3):\nHead: (9, 9)\nBody: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)]\nOh snap! The board visual shows T's at: (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8).\nMy previous board reading must have been slightly off due to the shorthand!\nTurn 9 Enemy Body was: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. Length 3. Score 3.\nIf they moved UP from (9, 8) to (9, 9), they would EAT THE APPLE at (9, 9) IF THERE WASN'T A T THERE!\n\nRereading the initial Turn 9 enemy body description:\n*   Snake #1 - Head: (9, 9), Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)], Apples: 3\n\n**Crucial Realization: The provided board state IS the state AFTER my move (LEFT) AND after the opponent's move!**\n\nMy Head is (8, 6).\nEnemy Head is (9, 9).\n\nHow did the enemy head get to (9, 9) if they started at (9, 8)?\n1.  They moved UP to (9, 9). This means cell (9, 9) WAS NOT part of their body before they moved, and it wasn't an edge they crashed into if they survived. Ah, the board shows an APPLE 'A' at (9, 9) in the visual!\n    *Wait, the A at (9,9) is also marked as T... This map notation is confusing! Let's trust the text stats.*\n\n**Text Stats for Turn 10:**\n*   YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (8, 6), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7)], Apples: 2. (My tail at (9, 7) dropped, confirming no apple eaten.)\n*   Snake #1: Head: (9, 9), Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)], Apples: 3. (Their score went from 3 to 3? Wait, the board says 'A' at (9,9) where their head is now! If they landed on an apple, their length should have increased! Their body length is still 3!)\n\n**CONCLUSION ON THE SIMULATION:** Since Snake #1's length did not increase (still 3 segments listed: Head + 3 body segments shown on map, meaning total length 4, same as before if my interpretation of the map structure vs body list is correct, but the text body list is only 3 segments!), and their score is still 3, **THEY DID NOT EAT AN APPLE.**\n\nIf their head is at (9, 9) and their previous head was (9, 8), they moved UP.\nMy head moved LEFT to (8, 6).\n\n**Did either move cause death?**\n1.  My move LEFT to (8, 6): Safe (not into body nor off board).\n2.  Their move UP to (9, 9): Safe on the map visual, assuming (9, 9) was empty or contained a dropped tail that was instantly replaced by the head. Given their score didn't increase, they didn't eat an apple. They survived.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION (Turn 10 End State):**\n*   **ME (0):** At (8, 6). Score 2. Segment length 3. Cornered slightly, but have moved WAY out towards the center.\n*   **ENEMY (1):** At (9, 9). Score 3. Length 4. Now sitting in the top-right corner!\n\nWe are down 3-2 points, which means they are currently longer than me and slightly ahead. I need to grow or trap them! Their head at (9, 9) is currently boxed by the top and right walls!\n\n**My Options from (8, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Hits my own body segment at (9, 7) and (8, 7) is clear, but (9, 7) is my body! Wait, my body is [(9, 6), (9, 7)]. If I move UP to (8, 7), this is CLEAR space! This moves me adjacent to my own body segment (9, 7) and closer to the enemy at (9, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Passive. Retreating into the bottom area away from the action.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Aggressive move towards the center, away from the enemy corner.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Hits my own body segment! **INSTANT DEATH!** (Wait, my head is at (8, 6), my body is [(9, 6) which is where I just came from, (9, 7)]. Moving RIGHT to (9, 6) hits my own previous head position? No, if I move RIGHT to (9, 6), that is the cell my head occupied last turn. But my body list is [(9, 6), (9, 7)]. Moving to (9, 6) is hitting the cell where my body is! **DEATH!**\n\n**Checking Safe Egress from (8, 6):**\n*   My body is [(9, 6), (9, 7)].\n*   UP to (8, 7): SAFE.\n*   DOWN to (8, 5): SAFE.\n*   LEFT to (7, 6): SAFE.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 6): DANGER! (9, 6) is my body segment! **NO RIGHT!**\n\n**Enemy Head is @ (9, 9).** They are pinned high! I need to leverage this!\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves based on Enemy Position (9, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** This is a solid move. It connects me diagonally to their space but keeps me adjacent to my own (9, 7). It prepares me for a potential pincer move next turn if they move LEFT or DOWN.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Too passive. Lets them control the top half.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** This moves me deep into the center mass of apples. This is great for growth, but it gets me further away vertically from their trapped head at (9, 9).\n\n**What does Snake #1 WANT to do from (9, 9)?** They need to escape the corner!\n*   DOWN to (9, 8): Safe (hits their old head position).\n*   LEFT to (8, 9): Safe (moves toward center).\n*   UP/RIGHT: Off board death.\n\nIf I go **UP (8, 7)**:\n*   If they go LEFT (8, 9): We are now on the same Y-level, separated by one segment (mine at (9, 7)). This is good closing distance!\n*   If they go DOWN (9, 8): They retreat. I can follow up with a move towards their tail or continue pressing left/up.\n\nIf I go **LEFT (7, 6)**:\n*   If they go LEFT (8, 9): They gain ground, I gain space, but the distance between our heads increases unless they take a further action.\n\n**STRATEGY: CORNER THE LEAD! SCORE 3 vs 2!** We must maintain pressure against their high position! Moving UP to (8, 7) seems the most direct way to maintain vertical threat while securing my own position near my segments. It keeps the game tight! If I let them move left too freely, they establish a strong presence. I need to be right there when they try to pop out!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Pressure Snake #1's head (9, 9). Move UP towards it while maintaining body safety. If they retreat down to (9, 8), I will shift focus to eating the apples at (7, 2) and (6, 6) to gain length advantage rapidly. For now: Direct confrontation setup!\n\nUP! This is our time to strike!\n\nUP",

We have exactly **ONE** legal move: **UP**. If we don't go up, we die instantly. \n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\n- **Score:** Me (3) vs Enemy (2). I have the lead.\n- **Position:** By going UP to (9,9), I secure the top-right corner. I am effectively boxing the enemy in against the wall at (9,6). \n- **Next Turn:** From (9,9), I can drop down to (9,8) (which will be empty as my body moves up) or move LEFT to (8,9) to start hunting him down.\n\nThere is no choice here. We take the only path to survival and continue the hunt!\n\n**UP**",
