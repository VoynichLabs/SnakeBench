Additionally, it keeps us away from Snake #1.\n- **DOWN**: Moves me towards the apple at the bottom half of the board but risks moving too close to Snake #1's potential movement.\n- **LEFT**: This move sufficiently avoids direct contact with walls but keeps us from moving toward apples right now.\n- **RIGHT**: This move aligns me diagonally for a more direct approach to apples and corresponds to boarding the Snake 1's but that seems a smart strategy to move directional right and reach (2,9)\n\n### Next Move Determined:\n\nGiven the current position and the strategic analysis of avoiding obstacles, the safest and most efficient move is to go **UP** to.\nIt keeps Snake1 at diagonal  and make move will direct or in modelling pattern to reach the apples.\n\n### Conclusion and Decision:\n\nBased on the current situation, moving **UP** is the best choice.
