This is the optimal move: I get a point and grow.\n   - No enemy snake occupies (8,3).

Not productive unless forced to retreat.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The apple at (8,3) is directly above me, one move away. No other snakes threaten to claim it before me.\n- After grabbing (8,3), I will have a body of length 2. I'll have to start minding not to move back onto my own tail; but with only a head and one segment, this is straightforward\u2014as I'll occupy (8,3) (head) and (8,2) (tail).  \n- Best follow-up apples: (7,2) (left & down), which is nearby, assuming no enemy intervenes.\n\n---\n\n#### **Risks?**\n- None immediate. Enemy snake is distant, apples close, no wall in the way.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After eating (8,3), consider LEFT and then DOWN to (7,2) apple, unless the enemy heads down rapidly.\n- Start keeping track of my tail, since it will exist next turn.\n- Watch for the enemy approaching vertically.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Next Move:**\n**UP**\n\n(To move from (8,2) \u2192 (8,3), collecting the apple.)\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:** UP"

Relative Safety**\n- **UP** to (5,3): Safest path towards where we want to eventually reach, vertical proximity to apples at (5,5) and potentially looping up to (0,5).\n- **LEFT** to (4,2): Going slightly away from the apples, but keeps options open.\n- **DOWN** to (5,1): Further away from any apples, closest to left wall, not too risky but not progressing towards an apple.\n  \n### **6. Enemy Plans**\n- Enemy at (5,5). They may move UP (to apple at [5,6], already in their body), DOWN (toward where I'm going), LEFT (to [4,5]), RIGHT (to [6,5]), or stay put. I can't control for their move, but if I head UP I'm nowhere near them.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Best Path to Apples**\n- If I go UP to (5,3), and if enemy vacates (5,5), I can continue UP towards it.\n- If enemy stays, I can move LEFT or RIGHT as needed.\n- Heading UP keeps me closer to vertical line of apples and more options for maneuver.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy**\n- I want to continue moving towards (5,5) if possible, with (0,5) as a backup apple if (5,5) stays blocked.\n- Always avoid moving into my own body and enemy.\n- Use UP moves to gain vertical space and stay open to pivoting left/right if blocked.\n\n---\n\n### **MOVE**\n\n**UP** is the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**  \n- If (5,5) vacates, continue UP and approach for the apple.\n- If enemy stays, pivot to (4,3) or (6,3) as seems safe.\n- Keep eyes on enemy head to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**UP**"

My Snake State**\n- **Head:** (5,3)\n- **Body:** (5,2), (6,2)\n- My snake is now vertical, moving from lower-center to slightly higher.\n\n### **2. Enemy Snake**\n- **Snake #0:** Still at (4,5) (head), with body at (5,5).\n    * Enemy seems to have moved LEFT. The head is now at (4,5), the body at (5,5).\n    * This means (5,5) is now the body, no longer the head (and not as dangerous as enemy head, but still blocking the apple).\n- **The enemy snake's tail** is at (5,6), [context suggests from last move], and its head is trending leftwards.\n\n### **3. Apples**\n- (0,5), (0,7), (4,8), (7,8), (9,7)\n- No apple immediately adjacent to me; nearest apple at (0,5).\n- (5,5) apple is no longer listed (apple was probably eaten by enemy or blocked), so apples are only at edge zones.\n\n### **4. Surroundings Check**\nFrom (5,3):\n\n- **UP (5,4):** Empty.\n- **DOWN (5,2):** My own body.\n- **LEFT (4,3):** Empty.\n- **RIGHT (6,3):** Empty.\n\nSo, **DOWN is blocked by my own body**.\n**All other moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are available.**\n\n### **5. Relative Safety & Strategy**\n- **UP (5,4):** Moving toward upper rows (but not directly to apples).\n  - Next move: Could continue up to (5,5), but that's currently enemy snake\u2019s body\u2014a blocking hazard, but not a head, so not instant death.\n  - However, the body of enemy is there\u2014you can't take that space.\n- **LEFT (4,3):** This would pivot me toward the left side apples at (0,5) and (0,7).\n- **RIGHT (6,3):** Opens up toward right, but no apples immediately\u2014although possibly more open space.\n- **DOWN (5,2):** Cannot go here; my own body.\n\n#### **Apple Access:**\n- All apples are well away\u2014closest is (0,5); path would require me to move toward the left.\n- The only apple on my vertical line, (5,5), has been vacated as an apple but is occupied by enemy body.\n\n#### **Enemy Location:**\n- Enemy snake is currently above and left ([4,5], [5,5]).\n- If I head UP, in two turns I\u2019d be at (5,5)\u2014but that's currently blocked by the enemy's body.\n- If I move UP this turn, I collide with no one, but to get further up, I may get pinned if enemy continues left/down loop.\n\n#### **Possible Enemy Behavior:**\n- If enemy continues LEFT from (4,5), they go to (3,5), freeing up (5,5) soon.\n- But the body of the enemy will trail on (5,5) for at least one more turn (unless they ate an apple recently and the tail hasn't advanced yet).\n\n---\n\n### **Move Options and Analysis**\n\n#### 1. **UP (5,4)**\n- No current hazard.\n- Prepares potential push for left or right, or a wait to see if vertical opens up.\n- Enemy snake is at (4,5)\u2014potential for collision if enemy moves DOWN, but not direct threat this turn.\n\n#### 2. **LEFT (4,3)**\n- Clear square.\n- Opens up path to left, to approach (0,5)/(0,7) apples.\n- Also keeps some distance from the enemy, trending to a less-crowded space.\n\n#### 3. **RIGHT (6,3)**\n- Clear square.\n- More open space, no apples to right; path doesn't help apple gathering unless circling the board.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Move?**\n- **UP keeps me pushing north, but with a block ahead (enemy body at (5,5)).**\n- **LEFT takes me toward two apples and possibly a less crowded half of the board.**\n\n**If I go UP:** My next moves will hit the row threatened by enemy snake's body\u2014not fatal, but less productive while apples left and top are available.\n\n**If I go LEFT:** I begin making progress toward (0,5)\u2014next apple likely available. The path left is completely open.\n\nAlso, remember my snake is relatively short (only three segments), and needs to keep growing to stay competitive. Most apples are at the left edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision**\n\n**LEFT** is the optimal move.\n\n#### **Next Turn Strategy**\n- Continue moving left towards the apple at (0,5).\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement\u2014avoid their head especially.\n- If enemy leaves upper row, consider whether a vertical climb is possible later.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**LEFT**"

My Snake State**\n\n- **Head:** (4,3)\n- **Body:** [(5,3), (5,2)] (my tail is now at (5,2)).\n- I just moved LEFT from (5,3) to (4,3).\n- Facing: My last direction was LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Board Review**\n\n- Enemy #0: Head at (4,6), body at (4,5)\n    - Their last position was (4,5) head. They likely moved UP, leaving (4,5) as body and moving head to (4,6).\n    - Enemy is on the same x=4 column, but three rows above (my head at (4,3), enemy head at (4,6)).\n    - No enemies or bodies immediately adjacent to me. But the enemy snake is above on the same column.\n\n- Apples:\n    - (0,5), (0,7), (4,8), (7,8), (9,7)\n    - The (0,5) and (0,7) apples are still to my left and up.\n    - (4,8)\u2014straight up my current column.\n    - (7,8) and (9,7) are far to the right\u2014ignore for now.\n\n---\n\n**3. Move Safety and Options from (4,3)**\n\n- **UP (4,4):** Empty.\n    - Next square up (4,5) is enemy\u2019s snake body.\n    - Enemy head is two squares above (at (4,6)), but not immediately threatening.\n    - Caution: moving up could bring me near enemy after a couple turns!\n- **DOWN (4,2):** Empty.\n    - Open space.\n- **LEFT (3,3):** Empty.\n    - Open, moves toward edge (x=0), approaching apples at (0,5)/(0,7).\n- **RIGHT (5,3):** My own body (occupied\u2014do NOT go here).\n\nSo: UP, DOWN, LEFT are all open. RIGHT is blocked by my own body.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple Route Assessment**\n\nLet\u2019s map likely paths toward apples:\n\n- (0,5) is two columns left and two rows up.\n    - Immediate path: LEFT (3,3) \u2192 LEFT (2,3) \u2192 then can climb UP toward (0,5).\n    - Or UP along (4,4) etc., but enemy snake is above.\n- (4,8) is five rows directly up this column, but enemy snake is in that lane (body at (4,5), head at (4,6)).\n- (0,7) is three more up from (0,5)\u2014a possible sequence.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy Threat Analysis**\n\n- Currently, the enemy snake is above me in the same column.\n    - If I go UP, after one or two moves, I\u2019ll meet their body at (4,5) or head at (4,6).\n    - That means, unlike last turn, UP is not as safe\u2014risk of getting trapped or running into their body.\n- LEFT continues a route away from the enemy, toward the apples at (0,5), and gives me flexibility to climb up along the left edge.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term Strategy**\n\n- Zig-zag toward the (0,5) apple, possibly then up to (0,7).\n- Stay away from the \"enemy zone\" in the upper center columns, unless opportunity opens.\n- Avoid wall-hugging, but approach left edge for apple access.\n- Move with flexibility: keep multiple options open, avoid being cornered.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion & Move Selection**\n\n- **UP**: Risk of getting into a traffic jam with the enemy snake. Blocked by enemy\u2019s body in just two moves.\n- **DOWN**: Too passive, doesn\u2019t help reach apples.\n- **LEFT**: Safest AND most direct progress toward (0,5). No risk, open space.\n\n**Next turn plan:**  \n- If clear, continue LEFT (3,3) \u2192 (2,3), prepping to climb up once x=0.\n- If enemy pursues me horizontally, consider going UP once further left, or \"stair-step\" toward apples.\n- Watch for enemy head approaching from above\u2014most likely they\u2019ll focus center apples.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \n**LEFT**"

Check all directions\n\n- **LEFT to (2,3):**  \n    - Board: (2,3) is open.  \n    - Strategically, keeps me moving toward the left wall and those (0,5) and (0,7) apples.\n    - No immediate threat, leaves all directions open next turn.\n\n- **UP to (3,4):**  \n    - Board: (3,4) is empty.\n    - This \"stair-steps\" up toward that left top apple cluster, but *does not* approach apples as quickly as hugging the left edge.\n    - Enemy snake is far\u2014no direct threat from above.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,3):**  \n    - Board: (4,3) is my own body (occupied).\n    - SUICIDE. Do not go here.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,2):**  \n    - Board: (3,2) is open, but it's moving away from apples.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Apple Trajectory Assessment\n\n- **LEFT then UP (toward 0,5):**  \n    - If I continue LEFT for two more moves:  \n        - (2,3) next turn, then (1,3), finally (0,3).\n        - Then, start moving UP: (0,4), (0,5)\u2014direct path to the apple at (0,5).\n    - This path avoids the enemy entirely.\n- **Immediate UP then LEFT:**  \n    - Could go UP right now, then LEFT (3,4 \u2192 2,4 \u2192 etc), but this is slightly longer and may sacrifice tempo reaching the apple.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy Consideration\n\n- Enemy head is still up at (4,6), with body at (4,5).\n- They\u2019re not immediately threatening: they're considerably above and blocked from rapidly descending toward me.\n- Their likely paths are toward the (4,8) apple or maybe to the right/top apples. They will not get to the left edge apples before me if I proceed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Danger/Dead-ends\n\n- **LEFT** is open for at least two more moves before I hit the left wall, and as I reach (0,3), I\u2019ll need to go UP.  \n- **No immediate threat** from the enemy or myself, or being boxed in.\n- I must keep flexibility as I approach the left edge\u2014monitor the enemy and avoid getting cornered near the wall if they do a sudden shift.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary & Strategic Note for Next Turn**\n\n- Proceed LEFT to keep executing the plan toward the left-edge apples.\n- On reaching the left wall (x=0), switch to moving UP to reach (0,5) and (0,7).\n- Keep re-evaluating the enemy snake\u2019s movements\u2014if they redirect sharply to the left, be ready to evade upward.\n- Priority: Safely reach (0,5) apple, maintain escape routes, avoid box-in on the lefthand wall.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECISION:**  \nMove: **LEFT**\n\n**(Next head will be at (2,3); continue approaching (0,5) via the shortest, safest possible route.)**\n\n**Next turn strategy preview:** If still safe, continue LEFT again. Once on x=0, start heading UP. If enemy snake rapidly moves toward left wall for some reason, consider alternate escape up or right before getting pinned.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:** **LEFT**"

Apple's Best Path**\n\n#### **To (0,5)**\n- (2,3) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (0,3), then UP to (0,5) in two more UPs.\n- Fastest possible way to (0,5), unless something appears/disrupts.\n\n#### **To (0,7) after (0,5)**\n- If reach left wall (x=0), go UP for (0,7).\n\n#### **To any other apples**\n- (4,0) is bottom right, but I'd have to wind around my own tail and backtrack, less optimal.\n- (7,8), (9,7): far and on right/top side, not sensible unless enemy blocks me leftside.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Not near the left side.\n\n## 2. Analyze Immediate Choices\n\nI'm at (0,4). Potential moves:\n\n### UP \u2192 (0,5)\n- On the board.\n- There is an apple at (0,5) \u2013 big incentive!\n- Not occupied by my body.\n- No enemy snake.\n- Safe.\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (0,3)\n- On the board.\n- Occupied by my own body (tail).
