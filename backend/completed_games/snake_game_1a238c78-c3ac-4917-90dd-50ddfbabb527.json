If he drops **DOWN** this turn we\u2019d both land on (3,8) \u2192 double KO and he\u2019d still have more apples (9 vs 8).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,6) stays clear of his likely moves (he can only go **DOWN** to (3,8) or **RIGHT** to (4,9)). This keeps us alive and pushes us toward the lower\u2011y apple cluster at (2,2), (3,4), (6,4) etc.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,7) would step into the opponent\u2019s body cell \u2013 instant death \ud83d\udc80.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,7) is our own tail segment \u2013 moving backwards into yourself is also death \ud83d\udc80.  \n\nSo the only viable options are **UP** or **DOWN**. Which one preserves the most future openings? **UP** risks a collision that would hand the win to the rival; **DOWN** avoids that trap and moves us deeper into the board where we can later swing left and set up a head\u2011on trap when we out\u2011grow him.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f LONG\u2011TERM PLAN:  \n- Slide **DOWN** a few steps to y\u22485, then start weaving **LEFT** toward x\u22482 where we can box the rival in.  \n- Keep the head above his growing body while hunting the high\u2011y apples at (4,9), (7,9) and (9,9) to close the apple gap.  \n- Stay aggressive, but never step into a cell he could also occupy this turn.  \n\nDOWN",
