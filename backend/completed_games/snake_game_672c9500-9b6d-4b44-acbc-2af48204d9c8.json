No walls or snake bodies blocking any direction.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- (0, 8): far north\n- (2, 5): enemy is closer\n- (1, 2): enemy is closer  \n- (6, 9): I'm closer than enemy (distance 6 vs 8)\n- (3, 1): enemy is closer\n\nThe apple at (6, 9) is the closest to me and the enemy is moving toward the lower apples cluster.\n\n**Strategy consideration:**\n- **UP (6, 4)**: Takes me directly toward the apple at (6, 9)\n- **LEFT (5, 3)**: Moves me away from enemy and toward center\n- **RIGHT (7, 3)**: Moves me away from enemy but toward edge\n- **DOWN (6, 2)**: Moves away from all apples\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nFocus on the apple at (6, 9) which is closest and most accessible to me. The enemy is moving toward the cluster of apples at (2, 5), (1, 2), and (3, 1). I should secure the apple at (6, 9) first, then consider moving toward the remaining apples at (0, 8) and (6, 9) area. Avoid getting trapped near the right edge and maintain central positioning for maximum mobility.\n\nUP",
