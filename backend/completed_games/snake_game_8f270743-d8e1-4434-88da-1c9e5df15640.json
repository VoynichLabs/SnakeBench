So (9,7) is on the board and empty, safe)\n\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill me:\n   - None of the moves kill me immediately (no off-board, no body collision, no enemy body collision).\n\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that:\n   - Keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\n   - Move me closer to reachable apples\n   - Avoid likely head-on collisions\n\nApples are at: (0,7), (7,0), (3,4), (5,8), (9,1)\nMy current head: (8,7)\n\n- UP to (8,8): distance to nearest apple (5,8) is 1 (Manhattan distance), very close. Also, (8,8) is adjacent to (9,8) and (7,8), both empty, so good follow-up options.\n- DOWN to (8,6): distance to (3,4) is 5, (7,0) is 7, not close. Follow-up options: (8,5), (7,6), (9,6) \u2014 all empty, but less strategic.\n- LEFT to (7,7): distance to (5,8) is 3, (3,4) is 3, (0,7) is 7. Follow-up options: (7,8), (6,7), (7,6) \u2014 all empty, decent.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): distance to (9,1) is 6, (5,8) is 3. Follow-up options: (9,8), (9,6) \u2014 both empty, but fewer options than UP.\n\nEnemy snake head at (1,3). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (1,4) \u2014 near apple at (3,4)\n- DOWN to (1,2)\n- LEFT to (0,3)\n- RIGHT to (2,3)\n\nIf I move UP to (8,8), enemy is unlikely to reach me this turn. If enemy moves UP to (1,4), they get closer to apple at (3,4), which is good for them but not a threat to me.\n\nUP gives me the closest apple (5,8) next turn, and keeps good follow-up options. It also avoids any immediate collision risk with the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize eating the apple at (5,8) next turn, then reassess based on enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped in corners; keep open paths.\n\nRIGHT",
