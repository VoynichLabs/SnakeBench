From (3,6), going UP to (3,7) then UP to (3,8) then RIGHT to (4,8).\n- To reach (2, 4): I need to go LEFT and DOWN. From (3,6), going DOWN to (3,5) then DOWN to (3,4) then LEFT to (2,4).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 0), far from me. It will likely go for (8, 1), (1, 2), or (9, 2) which are closer to it.\n\nLet me calculate distances from enemy at (3, 0):\n- (8, 1): |8-3| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- (4, 8): |4-3| + |8-0| = 1 + 8 = 9\n- (1, 2): |1-3| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4 (closest for enemy)\n- (9, 2): |9-3| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- (2, 4): |2-3| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nThe enemy will likely go for (1, 2) which is closest to them.\n\nI should go for either (4, 8) or (2, 4). Let me think about which is better:\n\n(4, 8) is in the upper portion of the board, and I'm already at y=6, so going up makes sense.\n(2, 4) is below me and to the left.\n\nGoing UP toward (4, 8) keeps me away from the enemy who is at the bottom. This seems like a good strategy.\n\nLet me go UP to start moving toward (4, 8). From (3, 6) going UP takes me to (3, 7), then I can go UP again to (3, 8), then RIGHT to (4, 8) to get the apple.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going UP first vs RIGHT first:\n- UP to (3, 7), then UP to (3, 8), then RIGHT to (4, 8) = 3 moves\n- RIGHT to (4, 6), then UP to (4, 7), then UP to (4, 8) = 3 moves\n\nBoth are 3 moves. Let me think about which path keeps more options open.\n\nGoing UP keeps me in the middle-left area with more movement options.\nGoing RIGHT also seems fine.\n\nI'll go UP to start heading toward (4, 8). This keeps me away from the enemy and moves toward the nearest apple.\n\nStrategy for next few turns: Go UP twice, then RIGHT to collect apple at (4, 8). Then potentially move toward (2, 4) or (8, 1) depending on enemy position.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current game state:\n\nMy head is at (3, 6) with no body. The enemy snake is at (3, 0), far away at the bottom.\n\nLet me evaluate the apples by distance from my position:\n- (4, 8): distance 3 (1 right, 2 up) - closest!\n- (2, 4): distance 3 (1 left, 2 down) - also closest!\n- (1, 2): distance 6\n- (8, 1): distance 10\n- (9, 2): distance 10\n\nThe enemy at (3, 0) is closest to (1, 2) at distance 4, so they'll likely target that apple.\n\nAll four moves are currently safe (no body to hit, all within bounds):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 7): safe, moves toward apple at (4, 8)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 5): safe, moves toward apple at (2, 4)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 6): safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6): safe, also moves toward (4, 8)\n\nStrategic choice: Going for (4, 8) keeps me in the upper portion of the board, away from the enemy who's at the bottom. This gives me space to collect apples while the enemy is busy with the bottom apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Go UP to (3, 7), then UP to (3, 8), then RIGHT to (4, 8) to collect the apple. After that, evaluate whether to go for (2, 4) or other apples based on enemy position.\n\nUP",

I can reach it in 2 moves.\n\nFrom (3, 7):\n- To reach (4, 8): I need to go UP to (3, 8) then RIGHT to (4, 8), OR RIGHT to (4, 7) then UP to (4, 8).\n\nBoth paths are 2 moves.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 0), very far away. Let me see what apples are closest to them:\n- (8, 1): |8-2| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- (4, 8): |4-2| + |8-0| = 2 + 8 = 10\n- (1, 2): |1-2| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3 (closest for enemy!)\n- (9, 2): |9-2| + |2-0| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- (2, 4): |2-2| + |4-0| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\nThe enemy will likely go for (1, 2) which is closest to them at distance 3. So I don't need to worry about (1, 2) for now.\n\nMy priority should be to get (4, 8) which is just 2 moves away.\n\nLet me think about which path to take:\n1. UP to (3, 8), then RIGHT to (4, 8) - apple collected!\n2. RIGHT to (4, 7), then UP to (4, 8) - apple collected!\n\nBoth paths work. Let me think about which gives better positioning after collecting the apple:\n\nIf I go UP first:\n- Turn 1: (3, 8)\n- Turn 2: (4, 8) - collect apple, now have body at (3, 8)\n- From (4, 8), I can go UP to (4, 9), RIGHT to (5, 8), or DOWN to (4, 7) (can't go LEFT into my body at (3, 8))\n\nIf I go RIGHT first:\n- Turn 1: (4, 7)\n- Turn 2: (4, 8) - collect apple, now have body at (4, 7)\n- From (4, 8), I can go UP to (4, 9), LEFT to (3, 8), or RIGHT to (5, 8) (can't go DOWN into my body at (4, 7))\n\nBoth seem equally good. Going UP first aligns with my previous plan from last turn.\n\nAfter collecting (4, 8), the next closest apple would be (2, 4) at distance from (4, 8):\n|2-4| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nLet me stick with the plan: go UP to (3, 8), then RIGHT to (4, 8) to collect the apple.\n\nStrategy note for future: After collecting (4, 8), head toward (2, 4) which would be the next target. The enemy will likely have collected (1, 2) by then and might be going for (2, 4) as well, so I need to be careful about potential collisions.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\nMy head is at (3, 7). The closest apple is at (4, 8), only 2 moves away!\n\nLet me check all moves from (3, 7):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 8): safe, within bounds, one step from apple at (4, 8)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 6): safe, moves away from closest apple\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 7): safe, moves away from closest apple\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7): safe, also moves toward apple at (4, 8)\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 0), very far away at the bottom. They're closest to apple (1, 2) at distance 3, so they'll likely head there. No collision risk with my current path.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to the apple at (4, 8) in 2 moves:\n- UP then RIGHT: (3, 7) \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 (4, 8) \u2713\n- RIGHT then UP: (3, 7) \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 (4, 8) \u2713\n\nI'll continue with my previous plan and go UP to (3, 8), then next turn go RIGHT to collect the apple at (4, 8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** \n1. This turn: UP to (3, 8)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (4, 8) to collect apple\n3. After that: Head toward (2, 4) as the next target, watching for enemy position\n\nUP",

This is the obvious choice!\n\nCollision check with enemy:\n- Enemy head is at (2, 1), very far away\n- Their possible moves are all in the lower area of the board\n- No risk of head-on collision at (4, 8)\n\nThis follows my plan exactly from last turn - I went UP to (3, 8), and now I go RIGHT to collect the apple at (4, 8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (4, 8) - collect apple! (score becomes 1)\n2. After collecting, my body will be at (3, 8)\n3. Next target: (2, 4) at distance 6 - head DOWN and LEFT\n4. Watch enemy - they're likely going for (1, 2) which is close to them\n5. After (2, 4), the enemy might also be targeting it, so move quickly\n\nRIGHT",

Would kill me!\n- RIGHT: (5, 8) - safe, within bounds, no collision\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated - that's where my tail/body is.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow let me think about strategy:\n\nDistances to apples from (4, 8):\n- (5, 7): |5-4| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2 - CLOSEST!\n- (2, 4): |2-4| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- (1, 2): |1-4| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9\n- (8, 1): |8-4| + |1-8| = 4 + 7 = 11\n- (9, 2): |9-4| + |2-8| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is only 2 moves away! I should head there.\n\nFrom (4, 8), to get to (5, 7):\n- I need to go RIGHT (to increase x from 4 to 5) and DOWN (to decrease y from 8 to 7)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8), then I'm 1 step from (5, 7) - just DOWN\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7), then I'm 1 step from (5, 7) - just RIGHT\n\nBoth paths get me to the apple in 2 moves.\n\nLet me check enemy position and what they might do:\n- Enemy head at (3, 1)\n- Closest apples to enemy:\n  - (1, 2): |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n  - (8, 1): |8-3| + |1-1| = 5 + 0 = 5\n  - (9, 2): |9-3| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nEnemy will likely go for (1, 2) which is closest to them. They're far from me, so no head-on collision risk.\n\nLet me think about which move is better - RIGHT or DOWN:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 7):\n- My body will be at (4, 8)\n- Next turn I can go: UP (back to where I was, but body moves), DOWN (4, 6), LEFT (3, 7), RIGHT (5, 7) - apple!\n- All four directions seem viable next turn\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 8):\n- My body will be at (4, 8)\n- Next turn I can go: UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7) - apple!, LEFT (4, 8) - that's my old position, body will have moved... let me think. After moving RIGHT, my head is at (5, 8) and body at (4, 8). So LEFT would go back to (4, 8) where my body is - that would kill me!\n- So from (5, 8), safe moves are: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nHmm, going DOWN keeps more options open (4 directions vs 3).\n\nAlso, going DOWN to (4, 7) puts me closer to the apple at (5, 7) in a position where I have more flexibility.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Both paths are 2 moves to the apple. Let me think about what happens after collecting the apple at (5, 7):\n\nAfter collecting (5, 7):\n- Next closest apple is (2, 4): |2-5| + |4-7| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nFrom (5, 7), I'd want to go LEFT and DOWN to reach (2, 4).\n\nIf I take the DOWN-RIGHT path:\n- Turn 3 (now): DOWN to (4, 7)\n- Turn 4: RIGHT to (5, 7) - collect apple\n- Then head toward (2, 4)\n\nIf I take the RIGHT-DOWN path:\n- Turn 3 (now): RIGHT to (5, 8)\n- Turn 4: DOWN to (5, 7) - collect apple\n- Then head toward (2, 4)\n\nBoth paths lead to the same result. But DOWN keeps more options open.\n\nActually, let me also consider UP to (4, 9):\n- This moves away from all apples\n- Not a good strategic choice unless needed for safety\n\nI'll go with DOWN to (4, 7) to head toward the apple at (5, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. This turn: DOWN to (4, 7)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (5, 7) - collect apple\n3. After that: Head toward (2, 4) - go LEFT and DOWN\n4. Enemy is likely collecting (1, 2), then might go for (2, 4) too - need to be faster\n\nDOWN\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\nMy head is at (4, 8) with body at (3, 8).\n\nLet me check all moves:\n- UP \u2192 (4, 9): safe, within bounds\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 7): safe, within bounds\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 8): DANGER! That's where my body is - would kill me!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8): safe, within bounds\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow for strategy - looking at apple distances from (4, 8):\n- (5, 7): distance 2 - CLOSEST! Just 1 right and 1 down\n- (2, 4): distance 6\n- (1, 2): distance 9\n- Others are farther\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is the clear target. I can reach it in 2 moves.\n\nTwo paths to (5, 7):\n1. DOWN to (4, 7), then RIGHT to (5, 7)\n2. RIGHT to (5, 8), then DOWN to (5, 7)\n\nGoing DOWN keeps more options open (4 possible moves next turn vs 3 if I go RIGHT, since LEFT would run into my body).\n\nEnemy snake at (3, 1) is far away and likely heading toward (1, 2) - no collision risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (4, 7)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (5, 7) - collect apple (score becomes 2)\n3. After collecting, head toward (2, 4) - go LEFT and DOWN\n4.

Going DOWN also works.\n\nLet me think about future moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 6), next turn I can go RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT (since my body will be at (5,7))\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 7), next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since my body will be at (5,7))\n\nBoth seem good. Let me pick DOWN to start heading toward (9, 5) while also potentially being able to reach (2, 4) if the enemy doesn't go there.\n\nActually, since (9, 5) is far from the enemy and I can get there first, let me head that direction. \n\nGoing DOWN to (5, 6) moves me closer to y=5. Then I can go RIGHT toward x=9.\nGoing RIGHT to (6, 7) moves me closer to x=9. Then I can go DOWN toward y=5.\n\nBoth are equivalent in terms of distance. I'll go DOWN.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. From (5, 7):\n- DOWN to (5, 6): distance to (9, 5) becomes |9-5| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- RIGHT to (6, 7): distance to (9, 5) becomes |9-6| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSame distance. Let me go DOWN to keep more flexibility in case I want to change targets.\n\nActually, I think RIGHT might be better for reaching (9, 5) since it moves me along the longer axis (4 spaces right needed vs 2 spaces down).\n\nLet me go RIGHT to (6, 7). This moves me toward (9, 5) and keeps options open.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\nMy head is at (5, 7) with body at [(4, 7), (4, 8)].\n\nLet me check all moves:\n- UP \u2192 (5, 8): safe, within bounds\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 6): safe, within bounds\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 7): DANGER! That's where my body is - would kill me!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 7): safe, within bounds\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow for strategy - distances to apples from (5, 7):\n- (2, 4): distance 6\n- (9, 5): distance 6\n- (8, 1): distance 9\n- (1, 2): distance 9\n- (9, 2): distance 9\n\nEnemy at (3, 1) is closest to (1, 2) at distance 3 and (2, 4) at distance 4. They'll likely target those.\n\nThe apple at (9, 5) is my best target - enemy is 10 moves away while I'm only 6 away. I can definitely get there first!\n\nTo reach (9, 5) from (5, 7):\n- Need to go 4 spaces RIGHT and 2 spaces DOWN\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT move me toward (9, 5). Going RIGHT covers the longer axis (4 spaces needed).\n\nChecking head-on collision:\n- Enemy at (3, 1) can move to (3, 2), (3, 0), (2, 1), or (4, 1)\n- None near my possible positions - safe!\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Head toward (9, 5) - go RIGHT and DOWN\n2. After (9, 5), reassess - maybe (9, 2) or (8, 1) next\n3. I have a 2-apple lead, maintain it by targeting apples enemy can't reach easily\n\nRIGHT",

Let me think strategically about which path is better.\n\nGoing DOWN to (6, 6) puts me at y=6, then I need to go down one more to y=5 and right 3 times to x=9.\nGoing RIGHT to (7, 7) puts me at x=7, then I need to go right 2 more times to x=9 and down 2 times to y=5.\n\nI'll go DOWN since it moves me toward the apple and keeps good options.

I'll aim to use about 30-40% of available thinking.\n</budget_strategy>\n\nLet me analyze the current game state:\n\n**My snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (6, 5)\n- Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7)]\n- Length: 3 (head + 2 body)\n- Apples: 2\n\n**Enemy snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (1, 0)\n- Body: none (length 1)\n- Apples: 0\n\n**Apples at:** (8, 1), (1, 2), (9, 2), (2, 4), (9, 5)\n\n**Checking all moves from (6, 5):**\n- UP \u2192 (6, 6): DANGER!

This turn: RIGHT to (7, 5)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (8, 5)\n3. Turn after: RIGHT to (9, 5) - EAT APPLE! (+1 point, total 3)\n4. After (9, 5), target (9, 2) directly south (distance 3)\n5.

This turn: LEFT to (6, 3)\n2. Next: UP to (6, 4)\n3. Then: UP to (6, 5)\n4. Then: UP to (6, 6) - get apple!\n5. After: Consider (5, 7) nearby\n\nLEFT",
