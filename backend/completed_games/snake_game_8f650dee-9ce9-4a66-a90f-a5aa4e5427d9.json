Who's ready for chaos? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick state recap:\n- Me (ID 0) head at (1,3). No body segments yet. Score 0.\n- Enemy head at (4,3). No body. Score 0.\n- Nearest apple to me: (2,3) \u2014 right next door. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThink-out-loud move eval (checking all 4 directions):\n1) UP -> (1,4)\n   - Safe (on board), not an apple. Keeps options open vertically. Could be useful, but doesn't contest the apple or pressure the foe immediately.\n2) DOWN -> (1,2)\n   - Safe. Also okay, but moves away from the fight and the nearest apple. Less aggressive.\n3) LEFT -> (0,3)\n   - Safe. Moves toward edge; riskier long-term (corners are choke points). Not grabbing apples or threatening opponent.\n4) RIGHT -> (2,3)\n   - Safe and immediately eats the apple at (2,3). Instant +1 and grows (advantage!). Also moves us toward the opponent at (4,3) so we can start pressuring.\n\nImmediate-death checks: none of the four moves are immediate death (no bodies in those cells, all inside the board). So all are safe, but RIGHT is clearly best by the aggressive strategy: grabs an apple and advances toward the enemy.\n\nOpponent consideration: Opponent (4,3) cannot reach (2,3) this turn, so we are guaranteed that apple if we go RIGHT. They might move LEFT toward (3,3) next, but that doesn\u2019t stop us getting the apple now. We're tied 0\u20130, so we should avoid suicidal head-on trades unless we can force a win \u2014 instead, take the apple and apply pressure.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our Last Rationale next turn):\n- Take the apple RIGHT now to go up +1 and become length 2.\n- After eating, push east/right to close distance, forcing them toward the top/bottom or into a boxed area. Use our extra segment to control space and cut off their escape routes.\n- Avoid getting funneled into the left wall or corner; keep at least two exit options when engaging. If they try to trade heads, only commit if we can guarantee they die or we have more apples.\n\nMove decision: we're taking the apple and pressing the fight. Let's go get it, baby \u2014 FULL SEND! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re up 1\u20130 \u2014 time to punish!\n\nMove analysis (thinking out loud for the chat):\n- UP -> (2,4): safe, keeps vertical options open, but doesn\u2019t pressure the foe immediately.\n- DOWN -> (2,2): safe and near the apple at (3,2), but gives the opponent room to grab that apple or pivot; not the most aggressive contest move.\n- LEFT -> (1,3): DEAD \u2014 that\u2019s our own body behind the head. Never go backwards. Instant KO.\n- RIGHT -> (3,3): safe, moves us closer to the enemy, keeps multiple escape options, and lets us start cutting off their space. From (3,3) we can threaten their approach and try to herd them toward walls or force bad trades. Also no immediate head-on risk this turn (opponent can\u2019t reach (3,3) in one move).\n\nStrategy note / short-term plan:\n- Take RIGHT to close distance and apply pressure. Keep at least two outlets so we don\u2019t get boxed by our own tail.\n- If opponent starts moving toward us, bait them into tightening space \u2014 only force a head-on if we still have the apple advantage (we do: 1\u20130).\n- Next turns: use lateral moves to cut escape corridors, contest apples only when they help maintain board control.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 full send to close the gap and start the box.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy's head is at (3,3), his tail's at (2,3), and he's got one apple under his belt. I'm currently empty-handed, so I've got some catching up to do.\n\nOkay, let's evaluate the battlefield. I'm seeing a bunch of apples scattered around, but my primary target isn't a piece of fruit\u2014it's that snake's head.\n\nI can't hit the board's edge, and I have to avoid any part of his body. Looking at the board, moving UP puts me at (4,2), which is clear. DOWN is a no-go, that's (4,0), and I'm gone. LEFT is (3,1), also empty. RIGHT? (5,1) also free. So every direction is open. Hmm, not much of a trap yet, but let's think about the bigger picture. My goal isn't just to survive, it's to dominate.\n\nThe enemy's at (3,3). The cell to his right, (4,3), is open. A move there would put me in position to start cutting off his escape routes, maybe box him into a corner. LEFT is (2,3), which is his tail, so that's not ideal. UP puts me at (3,4), which is also clear, but it doesn't cut him off. DOWN puts me at (3,2), which is also clear.\n\nMy real goal is to build my length and use my body as a cage. To do that, I need to start growing. I need to start eating.\n\nThere are apples in every direction, but the one directly UP from my head at (4,2) looks like the best immediate target. It lets me start building vertically, which seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo my short-term plan is to grow vertically. Long-term, I'll use my growing body to cut off his escape routes.\n\nLet's lock it in. **UP** is the move. I repeat, my final decision is UP. Let's see how he reacts. \nUP \n](thinking) Alright, let's see how he reacts. I'll be ready to counter his next move. This is where the real game begins.

Best play: be aggressive and collect the apple to increase our lead (1->2) so we can force a head-on later if they get cocky. Plus grabbing (3,2) puts pressure on their approach lanes.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab the apple at (3,2) to widen our lead.\n- Then drive pressure horizontally to cut their escape routes while keeping at least two exits so we don\u2019t get boxed by our own tail.\n- Force awkward choices on them \u2014 if they try a head-on, we want the apple advantage.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 full send to take the apple and start the box.\n\nDOWN",

The first rule is survival, so I can't be reckless.\n\nLet's look at my options. I can go UP to (4,1), LEFT to (3,0), or RIGHT to (5,0). Down is off the board, so that's a no-go. I need to make a move that keeps me alive and puts me in a position to dominate.\n\nLooking at his current position, a direct confrontation isn't ideal. He's got two segments on his body, and I'm still naked. I need to grow before I can box him in.\n\nMy first target is an apple. My shortest path is directly up to (4,1), which is open. A move there is safe and puts me closer to growth. Left to (3,0) is also an option, but it's a further distance from other apples. Right to (5,0) is also an empty spot.\n\nMy long-term goal is to box him in. The most direct way is to get to (4,1) and then move up to (4,2), (4,3), and so on. This will create a vertical wall that cuts off his escape routes. It's a risky strategy because I'll be growing vertically, but it's a bold one.\n\nAnother option is to move left to (3,0) and then move up to (3,1), (3,2), and so on. This will create a horizontal wall that cuts off his escape routes. It's a more cautious strategy because I'll be growing horizontally, but it's a less aggressive one.\n\nThe third option is to move right to (5,0) and then move up to (5,1), (5,2), and so on. This will create a vertical wall that cuts off his escape routes. It's a riskier strategy because I'll be growing vertically, but it's a more aggressive one.\n\nThe best option is to move up to (4,1). It keeps me alive, it's the closest apple, and it sets me up for vertical growth. Let's go! \nUP\n](thinking) Okay, let's see what he's got.

Let\u2019s think it through:\n\nQuick legal-check:\n- LEFT -> (3,2) is my neck. Illegal. Don\u2019t do it.\n- UP -> (4,3) is safe but passive \u2014 gives the lone snake room to wiggle. Not what we want.\n- DOWN -> (4,1) is safe and aggressive \u2014 it pressures the enemy down on the bottom row, but doesn\u2019t grab points immediately.\n- RIGHT -> (5,2) is safe AND there\u2019s an apple there. Eats +1 apple (we go to 3), grows, and keeps 3 follow-up options (UP/RIGHT/DOWN). Aggro and rewards. Yes please.\n\nEnemy at (5,0) can try to go UP to (5,1) for an apple or dodge right/left along the bottom. If we take the apple now (RIGHT), we increase our lead to 3\u20130 which makes head-on trades much more in our favor and lets us force mistakes. Taking the apple also keeps escape routes open so we don\u2019t get boxed ourselves.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT now to take (5,2) apple \u2192 grow to length 4 and score 3.\n- From (5,2) keep pressure on the bottom: consider DOWN to (5,1) if they try to escape along the bottom, or RIGHT to cut them off. Keep at least two escape options until they\u2019re penned.\n- If they go for (5,1) apple, punishing follow-ups can either force them into the wall or make them walk into our body. We\u2019re up on apples \u2014 force head-on if they misstep.\n\nWe\u2019re hungry, we\u2019re fast, and we\u2019re closing the noose.

Neck (4,2) \u2014 LEFT is illegal (backwards). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- UP \u2192 (5,3): safe, but passive. Gives them wiggle room to escape.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2): safe, looks fine for flank play and keeps options open.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,1): moves directly into the opponent\u2019s head cell. Risky \u2014 could cause a head-on if they also go UP \u2014 but we\u2019re UP on apples 3 \u2192 1. If it mutual-kills, we win by apples. This is exactly the kind of aggressive play we want: force a head-on when we lead.\n\nWhat will the enemy likely do? They\u2019re cramped on the bottom (body at (5,0)), limited exits: LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1), or try to contest us by going UP into our space. If they try to fight us by going UP, we mutually collide and we win the round on apples. If they dodge, moving DOWN still pressures them into the lower row and lets us cut off escape next turn.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Commit to an aggressive collision: go DOWN now to force a head-on or shove them into the bottom row.\n- If they dodge to the side, follow and close the gap (shift RIGHT then DOWN to box toward the wall), keeping multiple escape lanes open until they\u2019re penned.\n- If collision happens and it\u2019s a mutual death, apples give us the win (3 > 1). If we survive, we\u2019ll keep applying pressure and snack on apples to lock the lead. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nTime to make the play \u2014 we\u2019re forcing the confrontation and taking that advantage.\n\nDOWN",
