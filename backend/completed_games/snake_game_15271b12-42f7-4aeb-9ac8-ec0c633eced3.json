We'll grow and remain in a position to maneuver towards the next objectives with more body segments.\n- **UP (8, 7):** This takes us away from all apples and doesn't contribute to our goal.\n- **LEFT (7, 6):** This doesn't bring us closer to any apple and delays our progress.\n- **RIGHT (9, 6):** Although it\u2019s moving far from our current objective, it could position us to reach the next target apple more quickly, but the downside is that it's not efficient for our short-term goal of acquiring the closest apple.\n\n**Potential Strategy:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (8, 5):\n1. Evaluate the next closest apple, which might be either (7, 0) or (5, 5), depending on our later position and potential growth.\n2.

Since that apple is gone, perhaps snake #2 ate it already or the board state given for apples is the crucial current fact. Either way, (5,5) apple is not available.\n\nNow, let's reevaluate the apple locations clearly available now: (7,0), (6,0), (7,1) at bottom-right of the board and (2,9), (8,9) at the top.

This is slightly less direct positioning than going UP.\n- Still a safe move, but slightly less direct towards apple targets.\n\nStrategically, securing clear vertical alignment to apples first makes my eventual path easier and keeps options open. Thus, moving UP puts me in a slightly better position long-term.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- Pay close attention to enemy snake movements, particularly if snake #2 moves upwards aggressively.\n- Keep focus primarily on reaching apple at (2,9), as it is closest and safest currently reachable apple.\n\nChosen next move: UP"

Gradually getting closer to multiple apples for future growth. Also keeps open future pathways for flexibility.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- It would be good to gradually navigate downward and rightward, as multiple apples are clustered in the areas closer to the bottom-right section of the board (e.g., (7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0)).\n- The apple at (8,9) is directly to my right far away, but currently blocked by my own body. First, I must create some flexibility, letting my body clear positions behind me.\n- Avoid unnecessary long detours and maintain flexible maneuvering routes for future apple collection.\n\nConclusion:\nThe best next step is DOWN to position (2,8).

Not viable.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy snake #2 remains far away at (5,2) and surrounding positions\u2014no immediate threat from enemy snake.\n\nEvaluating the two viable choices carefully:\n- RIGHT is safe, moves me further away from a nearby apple at (8,8), missing an easy extra point.\n- DOWN moves onto (8,8), instantly eating another apple. Clearly advantageous since it moves toward another apple, giving immediate benefit (growth and score).\n\nConclusion:\nChoice is clearly DOWN to grab the apple immediately and safely.\n\nStrategy Reminder for next turn:\n- After this apple at (8,8), reconsider positioning on the board.

          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "Thinking out loud:\n\nStep-by-step recap of current status after my last move DOWN:\n\n- My previous move DOWN took me from (9,6) to (9,5), which contained an apple, resulting in immediate snake growth.\n- My new head position is now at (9,5).\n- My updated body segments are: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)], total length now is 8 (head + 7 segments).\n- Apple at (9,5) has been consumed. Remaining Apples: (3,9), (2,6), (4,9), (6,6), (4,4).\n\nAnalyzing my immediate surroundings next to head position (9,5):\n\n- UP: Position (9,6), currently occupied by my own body segment\u2014UNSAFE.\n- DOWN: Position (9,4) is empty\u2014safe to move.\n- LEFT: Position (8,5) is empty\u2014safe to move.\n- RIGHT: Would move to position (10,5), out-of-bounds\u2014UNSAFE.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n\n- Nearest apples are now at (6,6), (4,4), (2,6), (3,9), (4,9). The apple at (6,6) is relatively closer and to the left and up. After moving LEFT, I could continue safely toward the direction of apple (6,6).\n- If I move DOWN, that would direct me further from apples above me, and create a longer path.\n- LEFT seems strategically optimal as it points towards the majority of apples and leads to shorter and quicker potential paths.\n- Other Snake (#2) position at (8,4) and moving constraints must also be considered but right now there is safe space between us.\n\nTherefore, the best move at this moment is LEFT, positioning myself better toward apples while safely avoiding self-collision and boundary collision.\n\nNext-turn strategy reminder for myself:\n- Continue carefully toward apple at (6,6) as my next objective.\n- Monitor snake #2 positioning closely to adjust the route if necessary.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"
