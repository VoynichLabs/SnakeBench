Keeps us on the left wall, with only two future options ((0,4) or (1,5)), and extends our wall-hugging, which can become constricting.\n- RIGHT → (1,6): safe this turn (empty, not our own body, not reachable by enemy head in one move). It moves us toward the board interior and toward the central/northern apples, especially (6,7) and (7,8), and helps unwind our dense top-left cluster instead of deepening it.\n\nEnemy head at (5,1) can only move to (5,2), (5,0), (4,1), or (6,1), so there is no possible head-on collision with either (0,5) or (1,6) this turn.\n\nBetween the two safe moves, moving RIGHT opens up more long-term space, gives us a faster path toward the contested apple at (6,7) (we reach it in fewer steps than the enemy if both go for it), and starts pulling our head away from the corner where our own body is thickest.\n\n**Plan to future self:** Continue moving east across row 6 for a few turns, then evaluate going up toward (6,7)/(7,8) if the enemy stays in the lower half. Avoid diving too far down into the enemy’s hunting ground while we have a lead; prioritize staying in the top/center and not enclosing ourselves against the left wall.\n\nRIGHT",
