I have to stay within bounds and avoid running into the walls, the enemy snake (head at **(7, 5)**), or moving backward.\n\n- **Closest apples**:\n\t1. (4, 5): 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down.\n\t2. (0, 5): 3 units to the left and 1 unit down (too far right now).\n\t3. (7, 1): 4 units to the right and 5 units down (also far).\n\t4. (0, 1): 3 units to the left and 5 units down (very far).\n\n### Strategy:\n\nTo stay safe and move toward apples effectively:\n\n- **Avoid backward moves**: Moving left or right from my current position could be risky since I\u2019m only 3 spaces in from the left wall, and moving backward to the left would be fatal.\n- **Optimize for the closest apple (4, 5)**: If I move down from **(3, 6)** to **(3, 5)**, then I can safely move right to **(4, 5)** to eat the apple.\n- **Avoid getting blocked in**: I will carefully position myself to be able to eat another apple shortly after this first move. My main goal is to establish a safe growth path without exposing my head to unnecessary risk.\n\n**Next move**: I will move **RIGHT** to position **(4, 6)**, which is safe since the closest enemy is at **(7, 5)** (3 spaces away horizontally and down). After that, I will prepare for a move **DOWN** to **(4, 5)** to eat the first apple.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**",

I can move right and then possibly make a decision based on the apples or the position of the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- My main goal right now is safety.

            "rationale": "### Current Situation Analysis\n\n#### **Board State:**\n\n- **Head:** **(0, 4)**\n- **Body:** [(0, 3)]\n- **Closest Apples:**\n\t- **(0, 5):** Still inaccessible due to the enemy snake **(8, 5)** and my body **(0, 3)**.\n\t- **(2, 5):** Slightly closer, but requires navigating carefully to avoid the enemy snake **(8, 5)**.\n\t- **(0, 1):** Accessible but risky due to corner positioning.\n\t- **(7, 1), (8, 9):** Still too far and not safe for immediate consideration.\n\n#### **Enemy Snake Movement:**\n\n- Enemy Snake #0:\n\t- Head at **(8, 5)**, body [(8, 6)].\n\t- Potentially restricted in movement but may attempt to approach **(7, 1)** for points.\n\n#### **Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Proximity to Apples:**\n\t- **(0, 1):** Close, but risky due to being in a corner. Not an optimal choice for the next move.\n\t- **(2, 5):** Requires careful positioning but could become accessible soon.\n\t- **(0, 5):** Requires patience and careful observation of Enemy Snake #0's moves.\n2. **Safety:**\n\t- **(0, 4):** Currently safe, but advancing towards **(2, 5)** requires careful planning to avoid traps.\n3. **Enemy Positioning:**\n\t- Stay out of Enemy Snake #0's potential path to avoid collision or getting boxed in.\n\n#### **Strategic Priorities:**\n\n1. **Maintain Safety:** Avoid immediate threats like walls and Enemy Snake #0.\n2. **Advance Towards Apples:** Prepare a future path towards **(2, 5)**.\n3. **Monitor Enemy Behavior:** Predict Enemy Snake #0\u2019s movement to capitalize on its mistakes.\n\n#### **Plan for Next Turn:**\n\n1. **Monitor Enemy Movements:**\n\t- Predict Enemy Snake #0\u2019s likely moves:\n\t\t- **LEFT:** **(7, 5)** \u2013 Opens a path to (2, 5) but may put me in danger.\n\t\t- **RIGHT:** **(9, 5)** \u2013 Traps itself temporarily.\n\t\t- **UP:** **(8, 6)** \u2013 Restricted by its body and wall.\n\t\t- **DOWN:** **(8, 4)** \u2013 Likely, as it advances towards **(0, 5)** or **(7, 1)**.\n\t- Adjust my move accordingly to avoid direct confrontation.\n2. **Prepare to Move Towards Apples:**\n\t- If **(0, 5)** remains blocked, focus on moving closer to **(2, 5)** while maintaining safety.\n\n#### **Decision for This Turn:**\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 5):**\n\t- **Rationale:** Tentatively tests the path while keeping options open for **(2, 5)** on the next turn. Avoids immediate threats but requires observation for Enemy Snake #0.\n\t- **Strategy for Next Turn:** If **(0, 5)** is safe, continue advancing towards **(2, 5)**. If not, prioritize defensive positioning and monitor Enemy Snake #0.\n\nNEXT MOVE: **LEFT**",
