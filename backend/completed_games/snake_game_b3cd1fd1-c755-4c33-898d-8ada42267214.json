          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE! Time to go HAM on this snake! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break this down. I'm at (1,2) with an empty body (let's gooo!), and the enemy snake #1 is chilling at (1,6) - same column, 4 cells above me. NO apples yet on either side, we're both at 0. BOARD IS LIT with apples everywhere though! (0,4), (1,4), (8,8)... plenty of content out there.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS TIME:**\n\nMy possible moves from (1,2):\n- **LEFT (0,2)**: Valid! No snake bodies there. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT (2,2)**: Valid! Safe. \n- **DOWN (1,1)**: Valid! Safe.\n- **UP (1,3)**: Wait... the board shows (1,4) has an 'A' (apple), but (1,3) is just empty space. UP to (1,3) is CLEAR... BUT let me check the board carefully. \n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 2: `. 0 . . . A . A . .` - I'm at (1,2), apples at (5,2) and (7,2)\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . . .` - (1,3) is empty!\nRow 4: `A A A . . . . A . .` - (1,4) has an apple!\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!** I need to check if moving UP into (1,3) is safe. The board shows (1,3) is empty (no number, no A, just dot). So UP should be safe... BUT I need to think about the enemy!\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,6). If I go UP to (1,3) and he goes DOWN to (1,5), we're still safe distance. If he goes DOWN to (1,5) and I go UP to (1,3), no collision. BUT if he goes DOWN to (1,5) and I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I could be at (1,4) grabbing that apple while he's at (1,5).\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI'm at 0 apples, he's at 0 apples. We're EVEN. But I'm BELOW him in the same column. The apple at (1,4) is RIGHT between us! This is a TRAP situation.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,3):\n- I'll be adjacent to the apple at (1,4)\n- Enemy is at (1,6), he can go DOWN to (1,5) \n- Next turn I could potentially go to (1,4) and eat, but he could also go for it...\n\nActually, let me reconsider. There's an apple at (1,4). If I go UP to (1,3) this turn, next turn I can grab it. But if the enemy goes DOWN to (1,5) this turn, then next turn we're both one cell away from the apple at (1,4). \n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If I go UP to (1,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (1,5), no problem. But if we BOTH try to go to (1,4) next turn, it's a DOUBLE KILL! \n\nGiven that we're TIED at 0 apples each, a double kill would end the game in a DRAW. That's bad for me - I want the WIN!\n\n**ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY:**\nGo LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2) or DOWN to (1,1) to avoid the apple at (1,4) entirely and go for different apples. There's an apple at (0,4) top-left, (8,8) top-right, (8,0) bottom-right...\n\nActually, looking at the board again:\n- (0,4) is an apple (top left area)\n- (1,4) is an apple (directly above me, but in the trap zone)\n- (2,4) is an apple (right of that)\n- (8,8) is far top-right\n- (8,0) is bottom-right\n\n**DECISION:** I should NOT engage in the apple at (1,4) because it's too close to the enemy and could lead to a draw. Instead, I'll go RIGHT to (2,2) to open up more options. From there I can:\n- Go UP to (2,3) then (2,4) to grab apple at (2,4)\n- Or go RIGHT to (3,2) to spread out\n- Or go DOWN to (2,1) if needed\n\nThis keeps me AWAY from the direct confrontation with snake #1 while positioning me for apples that are slightly farther away but safer.\n\n**PLUS:** Going RIGHT from (1,2) to (2,2) keeps me away from the board edge on that side (I have room to move further right), and I'm not getting trapped against the left wall.\n\n**LET'S DO THIS CHAT!** Going RIGHT is the smart play - avoid the direct apple conflict with the enemy and position for future growth!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Avoid the (1,4) apple conflict. Path toward (2,4) apple via (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) or head toward the bottom-right quadrant apples like (5,2), (7,2), (8,0) to spread out and dominate different areas. Watch the enemy's movements - if he goes for apples on the left/top, I'll take the right/bottom.\n\nRIGHT",

Both snakes length 1 (no body to block). Apples clustered around y=4 (0,1,2 x), some to the right (5,5),(6,6),(7,6) etc. We\u2019re tied 0-0 \u2014 don\u2019t force a head-on suicide unless we already had the edge.\n\nEvaluate all 4 moves (safety first, then future options):\n\n- UP -> (1,7)\n  - Safe (on-board, no bodies).  \n  - Keeps choices open (can go left/right/down next).  \n  - Doesn\u2019t get us to the apple cluster fast. Good neutral move.\n\n- DOWN -> (1,5)\n  - Safe right now.  \n  - MOST AGGRESSIVE at grabbing the apple line at y=4 (we could hit (1,4) next turn).  \n  - DANGER: opponent at (1,2) can push UP twice and contest (1,4) on the same turn, creating a possible head-on double-KO if we both aim for (1,4). Since we\u2019re tied, that\u2019s a risky stalemate. Avoid setting that trap for now.\n\n- LEFT -> (0,6)\n  - Safe now but hugs the wall (x=0).  \n  - Fewer escape routes afterward; could get boxed if we commit left too early. Might be OK for trapping later, but not ideal immediately.\n\n- RIGHT -> (2,6)\n  - Safe and gives the most free space.  \n  - Moves us off the same column as the opponent (reduces head-on risk).  \n  - Keeps multiple follow-ups open (UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN available) and sets up a clean path to the apple at (2,4) in two moves (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) while keeping options to pivot if opponent approaches.  \n  - Best balance of aggression + safety + flexibility.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to avoid an easy mirror head-on on x=1. Then pivot DOWN twice to take (2,4) if uncontested. After grabbing the apple cluster, use extra length to start cutting off his lanes (force him toward the wall) and only take a head-on if we have the apple lead.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 time to make the calm, smart aggressive play and keep options open. You want blood? We\u2019ll box him later \u2014 for now, safety + approach.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is at (2,6), same column, 4 cells above me. We're both at 0 apples - DEAD EVEN. \n\nBoard has apples everywhere: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (8,8), (8,0), (5,5), (5,2), (7,6), (6,7), (7,4), (6,6), (7,2), (3,7)... plenty of options!\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES FROM (2,2):**\n\n- **LEFT (1,2)**: Empty! SAFE. But this goes BACK toward the (1,4) apple zone where the enemy is lurking.\n- **RIGHT (3,2)**: Empty! SAFE. Opens up the right side of the board.\n- **DOWN (2,1)**: Empty! SAFE. But moves toward the bottom edge with less room.\n- **UP (2,3)**: Empty! SAFE. But brings me CLOSER to enemy at (2,6).\n\n**THE TRAP AVOIDANCE STRATEGY:**\n\nLast turn I went RIGHT to (2,2) to AVOID the (1,4) apple trap. Now I need to STAY STRONG and keep distance from snake #1!\n\nIf I go UP to (2,3), I'm now only 3 cells away from the enemy at (2,6). That's getting DANGEROUSLY close! If he goes DOWN to (2,5) and I go UP to (2,3), next turn we could both be one cell away from (2,4) apple - potential HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n\n**BETTER PLAY: GO RIGHT TO (3,2)!**\n\nWhy? Because:\n1. **KEEPS DISTANCE** from enemy snake #1 - he's on the left side at column 2, I'm moving right to column 3\n2. **OPENS UP THE BOARD** - from (3,2) I can go in 3 directions (up, down, right) with LOTS of space\n3. **POSITIONS FOR SAFER APPLES** - I'm now closer to (5,2), (5,5), (7,2), (7,6) apples on the right side\n4. **AVOIDS THE TRAP ZONE** - away from the crowded left/top area where enemy is\n5. **ROOM TO GROW** - I have the entire right side of the board to dominate!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nStay on the right side! Let snake #1 fight for the left/top apples. I'll sweep the bottom-right quadrant: (5,2) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,0). Control territory, stay alive, then CRUSH him when I'm bigger!\n\n**DON'T GET TRAPPED CHAT!** Going RIGHT is the move! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is at (3,6), same column, 4 cells above me. We're both at 0 apples - DEAD EVEN. \n\nBoard has apples everywhere: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (8,8), (8,0), (5,5), (5,2), (7,6), (6,7), (7,4), (6,6), (7,2), (3,7)... plenty of options!\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES FROM (3,2):**\n\n- **LEFT (2,2)**: Empty! SAFE. But this goes BACK toward the (1,4) apple zone where the enemy is lurking at (3,6). Moving left means getting closer to column 2 where enemy might go down.\n- **RIGHT (4,2)**: Empty! SAFE. Opens up MORE of the right side of the board.\n- **DOWN (3,1)**: Empty! SAFE. Moves toward bottom edge with apples at (1,0), (5,2), (7,2), (8,0).\n- **UP (3,3)**: Empty! SAFE. But brings me CLOSER to enemy at (3,6) - only 3 cells away now!\n\n**THE TRAP AVOIDANCE STRATEGY:**\n\nI went RIGHT last turn to get away from the left side where enemy is. Now I need to STAY STRONG and keep distance!\n\nIf I go UP to (3,3), I'm now only 3 cells away from the enemy at (3,6). That's DANGEROUS! If he goes DOWN to (3,5) and I go UP to (3,3), next turn we're only 2 cells apart - potential HEAD-ON COLLISION incoming!\n\n**BETTER PLAY: GO RIGHT TO (4,2)!**\n\nWhy? Because:\n1. **KEEPS MAX DISTANCE** from enemy snake #1 - he's at column 3, I'm moving right to column 4\n2. **OPENS UP THE BOARD** - from (4,2) I can go in 3 directions (up, down, right) with TONS of space\n3. **POSITIONS FOR SAFER APPLES** - I'm now closer to (5,2), (5,5), (7,2), (7,6) apples on the right side\n4. **AVOIDS THE TRAP ZONE** - away from the crowded left/top area where enemy is\n5. **ROOM TO GROW** - I have the entire right side of the board to dominate!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nStay on the right side! Let snake #1 fight for the left/top apples. I'll sweep the bottom-right quadrant: (5,2) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,0). Control territory, stay alive, then CRUSH him when I'm bigger!\n\n**DON'T GET TRAPPED CHAT!** Going RIGHT is the move! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

With both snakes tied, don\u2019t invite a symmetric sprint toward a collision.\n- LEFT -> (2,6): safe, but nudges us back toward the left cluster of apples and walls \u2014 less central control.\n- RIGHT -> (4,6): safe and roomy, but misses the immediate apple and cedes a free growth opportunity to the board.\n\nDecision: take the apple at (3,7). Getting the first apple gives us the edge to force confrontations later \u2014 we WANT that lead. We\u2019re not walking into a trap; this move keeps multiple follow-ups open and puts pressure high on the board. Short-term plan: grab this apple, then pivot right/down to box the opponent toward y<=3 while using our extra length to control chokepoints. Be ruthless, force the head-on only when we lead.\n\nUP",

Not an option. Nope. Not today. \u274c\n2) Legal candidates: UP => (3,8), LEFT => (2,7), RIGHT => (4,7).\n\nMove-by-move read (fast and brutal):\n- UP to (3,8): Keeps altitude, keeps lots of options (UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn except DOWN into neck). Safe, patient, keeps control of top half. Good if we want to linger and pick apples up high. \ud83d\udc4d\n- LEFT to (2,7): Grabs lateral ground on the left, can cut off those left-side apples later. Slightly delays approach to the opponent \u2014 less immediate pressure. Fine, but we don\u2019t want to drift away. \u21a9\ufe0f\n- RIGHT to (4,7): Moves toward the enemy\u2019s x-column (he\u2019s at x=4), keeps aggressive posture, opens a quick line to drop down and pressure/box him into y\u22643 in a couple turns. From (4,7) next moves include (4,8),(5,7),(4,6) \u2014 still lots of escape lanes. This balances aggression with safety. \ud83d\ude80\n\nTactical rationale: We\u2019re up 1\u20130. We want to use that lead to threaten a head-on if he gets greedy, but prefer to force him into tight space first. Going RIGHT pulls us toward his column while keeping multiple follow-up options and not cornering ourselves. We avoid DOWN (suicide) and don\u2019t waste a turn drifting left/up away from the fight.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns): Move RIGHT now to approach; then pivot DOWN to (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) to pressure his lane, forcing him to commit or be boxed into the bottom rows. If he overcommits head-first, we trade favorably (we\u2019ve got the apple lead). Keep checking for his pathing \u2014 punish any attempt to cut us off.\n\nRIGHT",

Use if you want immediate dive. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nTactical call: We\u2019re tied, so we DON\u2019T want to force a head-on trade unless we have the lead. Instead, get in his column and pressure, then force him into a smaller pocket. RIGHT is the play: it pushes toward his lane while keeping multiple safe follow-ups and preserves options to pivot DOWN next turn to start corralling him. Let him make the risky plays while we dictate space.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns): Move RIGHT now to (5,7) \u2192 next turn evaluate his moves; if he drifts into the center, pivot DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 (5,5) to seal off his path and threaten a box-in. If he starts moving wide, keep altitude and cut across to trap him along the left edge. Stay alive, keep options, bait mistakes, then close.\n\nRIGHT",

BOARD STATE IS NUTS!\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES FROM (6,2):**\n\n- **LEFT (5,2)**: That's my own body! DEAD immediately! NOPE!\n- **RIGHT (7,2)**: Empty! SAFE. Moves to (7,2) - there's an apple at (7,2) and (7,4) nearby!\n- **DOWN (6,1)**: Empty! SAFE. But we're already at y=1 - going DOWN hits board edge (0)!\n- **UP (6,3)**: Empty! SAFE. Moves us higher, away from bottom edge!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\nEnemy is at (5,7) - could move DOWN to (5,6) or LEFT to (4,7) or RIGHT to (6,7). If I go UP to (6,3), I'm getting closer to enemy territory. If I go RIGHT to (7,2), I'm staying LOW and RIGHT - dominating bottom-right quadrant!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\n\nRIGHT to (7,2) is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY because:\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD** - There's an apple at (7,2)! FREE GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **TERRITORY CONTROL** - I'm claiming bottom-right while enemy fights top-left!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (7,2) I can go UP to (7,3) \u2192 (7,4) for another apple!\n4. **AVOID COLLISION** - Enemy at y=7, I'm at y=2 - safe distance for now!\n5. **EDGE AVOIDANCE** - RIGHT keeps me away from bottom edge trap!\n\nUP gets me closer to enemy without immediate apple. DOWN is death (board edge). LEFT kills me. RIGHT is MURDER with a snack attached!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn: (6,2) \u2192 (7,2) EAT APPLE \u2192 then (7,3) \u2192 (7,4) \u2192 dominate right side \u2192 force enemy into top-left corner \u2192 WHEN I'M BIGGER, GO FOR THE HEAD-HUNTING!

Neck/tail: (4,7) \u2014 so LEFT = (4,7) is backwards into our body \u2192 insta-death. NOPE. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (6,2) \u2014 far below. No immediate head-on threat this turn. \u2705\n\nLegal moves to consider:\n- UP \u2192 (5,8): safe, keeps altitude, but moves away from the opponent and slows the pressure. Less aggressive. \ud83e\udd14\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7): aggressive, puts us in opponent\u2019s x-column (x=6), good lateral pressure and multiple follow-ups (UP/RIGHT/DOWN). Nice option. \ud83d\udcaa\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6): moves toward the opponent and toward the apple at (5,5). Keeps three follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN).

So avoid reckless collisions.\n- The opponent is far down at y=2; we can take the initiative by marching downward in his column and then pivoting to seal escape lanes. DOWN is the quickest way to start boxing him in and threatens a juicy apple at (5,5) on the way.\n- RIGHT is tempting for lateral pressure, but DOWN gives forward momentum to actually close space vertically and limits his easy escape routes later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Drop DOWN now to (5,6) \u2192 next turn push to (5,5) to eat or continue down to reduce his vertical room.\n- If he drifts right/up toward the center, pivot RIGHT to cut off escape and bait him toward the wall.\n- Maintain escape options (LEFT or RIGHT) and avoid head-on trades while we build the trap.

No wait... row 6 shows \"1 A A\" at columns 5,6,7? Actually it shows \" . . . . . 1 A A . .\" so position (5,6)=1, (6,6)=A, (7,6)=A\n\n**CHECKING MY MOVES FROM (7,2):**\n\n- **LEFT (6,2)**: That's my own body! DEAD immediately!

(7,1) is '.' on the board.\n- **UP (7,3)**: Empty! SAFE. (7,3) is '.' on the board.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\nEnemy at (5,6) - can move DOWN to (5,5) which has apple 'A', or LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6), UP to (5,7) but (5,7) is his own body!\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\n\nWe're at 3 apples vs his 1! We're WINNING! Let's be AGGRESSIVE!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,2): We stay low, avoid enemy, but no immediate apple. (9,2) has apple but we're not there yet.\nIf we go DOWN to (7,1): There's an apple at (7,4) above us, but we're going away from it. Board edge is at y=0, so (7,1) is safe but getting closer to edge.\nIf we go UP to (7,3): This gets us CLOSER to the apple at (7,4) and keeps us in the center-right of the board where we have more mobility!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n\nUP to (7,3) is the move! Why?\n1. **MOVES TOWARD APPLE**: Next turn we can go UP to (7,4) and eat that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **POSITIONING**: We're at (7,3), enemy at (5,6) - we're maintaining distance while staying in a good zone.\n3. **MOBILITY**: From (7,3) we have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all available (LEFT would be into body though... wait LEFT to (6,3) is empty! That's good too).\n4. **DOMINATION**: We're controlling the right side of the board while enemy is stuck on the left!\n\nNext turn: EAT (7,4) APPLE \u2192 then we'll be 4-1!

I collected an apple at (7,4) last turn (getting me to 3 apples), but the board update shows I'm still at 2 apples? Wait... Let me check the scoreboard: \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 2\" and \"Snake #1 apples: 2\". But I ate at (7,4)? Actually looking at the board state: Row 4 shows \"A A A . . . . A . .\" So there's an apple at (7,4) that's still there? Let me recount...\n\nActually from last turn's move: I went UP to (7,3) and was planning to eat (7,4) next. But the current board shows (7,4) is empty (no 'A' at column 7, row 4). So I must have eaten it! The scoreboard shows 2 apples? Maybe I ate 2 total? Let's trust the board state.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n\nFrom (7,3), my options:\n- **UP (7,4)**: Just ate there? Actually board shows row 4: \"A A A . . . . A . .\" Wait, let me re-read carefully... Row 4: \"A A A . . . . A . .\" So positions (0,4)='A', (1,4)='A', (2,4)='A', (7,4)='A'? Actually counting: \"A A A . . . . A . .\" That's 10 cells: (0,4)='A', (1,4)='A', (2,4)='A', (3,4)='.', (4,4)='.', (5,4)='.', (6,4)='.', (7,4)='A', (8,4)='.', (9,4)='.' So YES, there's an apple at (7,4)!\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: That's my own body (tail)! DEAD!\n- **LEFT (6,3)**: Empty! SAFE.\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Empty! SAFE.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\n\nWe're tied 2-2! The enemy moved DOWN to (5,5) - he's now at the apple row! He's going for food! But we have a direct apple at (7,4) - that's our path to lead!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n\n**UP to (7,4)** is the move! Why?\n1. **IMMEDIATE CONTENT**: Eat that apple! Go 3-2 lead!\n2. **POSITIONING**: We're in the perfect spot to control the right side while enemy fights over left-side apples.\n3. **MOVES**: After eating, we'll be at (7,4) with body [(7,3), (7,2)] - great shape!\n4. **DOMINATION**: Once we're 3-2, we can start pressuring enemy territory!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**: Eat (7,4) \u2192 position to cut off enemy from right-side apples \u2192 force him into left-side corner where we'll box him in!\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Opponent head = (7,3) with neck at (7,2) \u2192 they cannot move DOWN (backwards) this turn; their realistic moves are LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3), or UP (7,4) to grab that apple.\n\nConsidered moves:\n- UP \u2192 ILLEGAL (back into neck). Auto-no.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4): safe, moves us closer vertically to him, but doesn\u2019t grab an apple this turn and leaves only 3 exits next turn (no UP).\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5): safe, keeps lateral control but no apple, slower pressure.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5): has an apple at (6,5). Safe now (no bodies there). Grabs apple, grows, and gives us better lateral control to start boxing him in while keeping multiple escape routes (LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn \u2014 UP would be into neck).\n\nRisk check: Opponent can\u2019t immediately head-on us this turn because their head is at (7,3) and can\u2019t reach (6,5) in one move. Their obvious temptation is UP \u2192 (7,4) to take that apple, or LEFT \u2192 (6,3) to approach. We should avoid forcing a head-on while apples are tied; grabbing this apple ties / increases our board presence and enables better cutoffs next turns.\n\nShort-term plan (for the stream & next few moves):\n- Grab (6,5) now to grow and gain board control.\n- Use the extra length to shadow the 6-column, push down to confine his vertical space, and bait him toward walls. Keep at least two escape options each turn; don\u2019t commit to a head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- If he goes for (7,4), pivot to threaten his flank from x=6 while watching for his LEFT \u2192 (6,3) approach. Force him into the wall or his own body.\n\nTime to pop the apple and start squeezing. LET\u2019S CRUSH HIM!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break this down!  \n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**  \nMy head is at (7,4) (I just ate that apple last turn - scoreboard might be lagging, but I'm at 3 apples now). Body: [(7,3), (7,2)]. Enemy snake #1 at (6,5) with body [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7)].  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nFrom (7,4), my options:  \n- **UP (7,5)**: Empty! But wait... row 5 shows \" . . . . A T 1 . . .\" So (7,5) is empty? Actually let's count: Row 5: (0,5)='.', (1,5)='.', (2,5)='.', (3,5)='.', (4,5)='A', (5,5)='T', (6,5)='1', (7,5)='.', (8,5)='.', (9,5)='.' So yes, (7,5) is empty.  \n- **DOWN (7,3)**: That's my own body (first segment)! DEAD!  \n- **LEFT (6,4)**: Empty!  \n- **RIGHT (8,4)**: Empty!  \n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**  \nWe're tied 3-3! The enemy is at (6,5) - they're positioned near the apple at (4,5) but also close to our right-side territory. We need to either eat more apples OR force a collision.  \n\n**THE PLAN:**  \n**LEFT to (6,4)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **POSITIONING FOR COLLISION**: Enemy is at (6,5) - if I go LEFT to (6,4), I'm directly below their head! This sets up a potential head-on collision next turn if they move DOWN (into me) or if I move UP (into them). Since we're tied, I can afford to force a clash!  \n2. **SAFE FOLLOW-UP OPTIONS**: From (6,4), I can go LEFT (5,4), UP (6,5 - enemy's current spot), RIGHT (7,4 - my previous spot), or DOWN (6,3). Many options!  \n3. **BLOCK ENEMY PATH**: By moving left, I'm cutting off their potential access to the right-side apples (8,8), (8,0), (9,2), etc.  \n4. **AGGRESSION**: We're playing to WIN, not to hide! Let's box them in.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**:  \nMove LEFT to (6,4) \u2192 if enemy moves DOWN to (6,4), we collide and they die (we're tied, so we win since they'd hit our body). If they move elsewhere, next turn I can chase them or continue controlling the right side. Either way, we're applying pressure!  \n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51 BONUS CONTENT: The crowd wants a collision!  \n\nLEFT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Neck = (5,5) \u2192 LEFT is directly backwards into neck = ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t do that.\n- Opponent head = (7,4) with neck (7,3) \u2192 they cannot move DOWN (back into neck). Their legal options are LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4), or UP (7,5).\n- Important: apples are tied 3\u20133.

Nah.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4). Technically free, but it\u2019s exactly LEFT of the opponent\u2019s head (they can go LEFT into (6,4)). If they choose LEFT while we choose DOWN we\u2019d collide head-on (both die). With apples tied, that\u2019s a dumb risk. Avoid.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5).

It\u2019s not reachable by the enemy this turn, and moving up is safe from immediate head-on.

Once we\u2019re ahead on apples, force risky head-ons or cut him off when he has fewer escape routes.\n- Maintain at least two escape options each turn; don\u2019t tunnel ourselves into the top or the corner.

If they go DOWN, I win immediately!\n3. **APPLE ACCESS**: Left side has apples at (4,7), (4,5), (3,0). Right side has (8,8), (8,0), (9,2). By going LEFT, I'm cutting off their access to right-side apples while I claim the center.\n4. **SAFETY**: From (5,4), I have multiple escape routes\u2014UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), LEFT (4,4), or BACK to (6,4). Don't want to go DOWN to (6,3) because it might trap me near the bottom wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (5,4) \u2192 if enemy moves DOWN (into my body), they die and I win immediately! If they move elsewhere, I'll chase them next turn. We need that apple lead back. Let's force the issue!\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #1 at (7,6) with body [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)].\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom (5,4), my options:\n- **UP (5,5)**: ENEMY BODY! That's a segment of snake #1.

DEAD (backwards move).\n\nSo only SAFE moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nEnemy is at (7,6). They have 5 apples to my 3. I need to either eat an apple FAST or force a collision. But I can't go UP because it's their body. If I go LEFT or DOWN, I'm moving away from them.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n**LEFT to (4,4)** is the move! Why?\n1. **POSITIONING FOR FUTURE COLLISION**: From (4,4), I can potentially circle around and catch them. But more importantly, I'm clearing the path...\n2. **ENEMY PATH PREDICTION**: Enemy is at (7,6). Their likely moves: DOWN to (6,6) (empty), LEFT to (6,6) (same), UP to (7,7), or RIGHT to (8,6). None of these immediately kill them into my body. But by moving LEFT, I'm preparing to cut off their escape routes!\n3. **APPLE ACCESS**: Left side has apples at (4,5), (4,7), (3,0). Right side has (8,8), (8,0), (9,2), (8,2). By going LEFT, I'm moving toward (4,5) which is RIGHT ABOVE MY NEW POSITION (4,4)!

Keeps options OPEN.\n5. **BOXING STRATEGY**: I need to eventually box them in. Moving LEFT starts the encirclement. If I can push them into a corner or against the wall, they'll have fewer moves and might crash.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (4,4) \u2192 If enemy moves predictably, I'll go UP to (4,5) next turn for the apple, or chase them toward the left wall.

Now tactical read:\n- DOWN (7,5): pushes us toward the opponent\u2019s side, but our own body at (6,5) stays after the move, so turning LEFT next would be suicidal (we\u2019d hit our body). That move risks narrowing our options quickly \u2014 not ideal when we want to box them in safely.\n- UP (7,7): moves toward the apple at (6,7) (one move away). Good for a quick snack, but after UP our immediate DOWN becomes the neck (7,6), so we\u2019d rely on RIGHT or LEFT for escape. That\u2019s okay but a touch tighter than the best option.\n- RIGHT (8,6): opens up THREE clean exits next turn (UP (8,7), RIGHT (9,6), DOWN (8,5)). Keeps lateral space, lets us pivot toward apples at (8,8) or loop around to pressure the enemy\u2019s flank. Most mobility = best for forcing a head-on when we\u2019re ahead (5\u21923).

That's huge for head-on collision potential later.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n**UP to (4, 5)** is the move! Why?\n1. **IMMEDIATE GROWTH**: I grab that apple (+1 apple, +1 body segment). Now I'm at 4 apples\u2014catching up to their 5!\n2. **POSITIONING FOR AGGRESSION**: From (4, 5), I'm closer to the center and can chase the enemy if they move toward the left side.

Right now, eating is priority\u2014dominance through growth.\n5. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They might move to (7,6) or (8,5) or (9,6). None of these crash into me immediately. But if they go left/down, I can pressure them next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating at (4, 5), I'll monitor enemy movement. If they go left/down, I'll chase and cut off their escape routes.

Let's break this down like a pro!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\nMy head: (4, 5). Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]. Apples: 4 (we ate that apple last turn\u2014YES!).\nEnemy snake #1: Head (8, 7), body [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)]. Apples: 5.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom (4, 5), my options:\n- **UP (4, 6)**: EMPTY! Safe. (No apple there.)\n- **DOWN (4, 4)**: MY OWN BODY! That's the first segment behind my head\u2014deadly. NO BACKWARDS!\n- **LEFT (3, 5)**: EMPTY! Safe.\n- **RIGHT (5, 5)**: ENEMY BODY! That's the last segment of snake #1\u2014deadly. DO NOT GO THERE!\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT. DOWN and RIGHT are deadly. We're in a tight spot, but we have options.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nWe need to gain on the enemy fast! They have 5 apples, we have 4. We're aggressive\u2014head-on collision potential if we equal or surpass them. But first, we gotta survive and find growth opportunities.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- There's an apple at (8, 8) (top right)\u2014but enemy is at (8, 7), so they might grab it. Not great for us.\n- Apple at (0, 8) (far left)\u2014might be reachable if we go left.\n- Apple at (4, 7) is above us but empty now (no apple there in current list\u2014wait, apple list shows (4,7) is an apple! Let me check the list: YES, (4,7) is an apple! That's a target!\n- Apple at (3, 0) is far down left.\n- Apple at (6, 7) is near enemy territory.\n\nFrom (4, 5), UP to (4, 6) puts us one step closer to (4, 7) apple. LEFT to (3, 5) moves us toward the left side where apples (3,0), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) are.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n**LEFT to (3, 5)** is the move! Why?\n1. **POSITIONING FOR GROWTH**: From (3, 5), I can chase multiple apples on the left\u2014(2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (3,0), (0,8). That's a buffet! Meanwhile, enemy is on the right, busy with (8,8) and (9,4). I'm splitting the board.\n2. **SAFETY**: From (3, 5), future options are solid: DOWN to (3,4) is empty, UP to (3,6) empty, LEFT to (2,5) empty, RIGHT to (4,5) (my old spot, will be empty after move). No immediate traps.\n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: Enemy at (8,7) might go UP to (8,8) for the apple, or LEFT to (7,7), or DOWN to (8,6) (but that's his body). If he goes UP, he grows to 6 apples\u2014now we're down 4-6. That's bad! But if we can grab an apple soon, we close the gap.\n4. **BOXING STRATEGY**: By moving left, I extend my body's reach into the center. My tail will shift, possibly opening paths. I can later use my body to cut off enemy if they move left.\n5. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: UP to (4,6) is safe but doesn't give immediate apple access\u2014(4,7) is one step away, but if enemy moves left, they might block later. Left gives more options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter LEFT to (3,5), next turn I'll aim for (2,4) apple (left-down). Build body, chase apples on left side. Monitor enemy: if they go UP, I grow faster; if they come left, I can head-on collision if I have equal apples. Let's turn the tide!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Taking the apple grows us and increases our ability to dominate the top-right quadrant.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Grab (8,8) to grow and maximize escape options.\n- Use superior length to sweep down the 6\u20138 x-range and hem the opponent toward x\u22484\u20135.\n- If opponent drifts right into our trap, force a head-on (we\u2019re up on apples) or cut off escape routes.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THAT APPLE AND KEEP PRESSURE ON \u2014 stay aggressive, stay smart. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Enemy is on the right, might chase (9,4) or (9,6).  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nFrom (3,5), options:  \n- **UP (3,6)**: EMPTY! Safe. (No body, no apple.)  \n- **DOWN (3,4)**: EMPTY! Safe. (But note: (3,4) is adjacent to my body at (4,4)\u2014future trap potential.)  \n- **LEFT (2,5)**: EMPTY! Safe.  \n- **RIGHT (4,5)**: MY OWN BODY (tail shifts, but (4,5) is currently occupied by my body segment\u2014DEADLY if I move there, as it's essentially hitting myself. Avoid!)  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is suicide\u2014don't throw!  \n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**  \nWe need apples FAST to catch up! (2,4) apple is just two steps away (DOWN then LEFT from here). But let's think aggressive:  \n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: Moves us toward the apple cluster (2,4) directly. From there, we can DOWN to (2,4) next turn and eat! Also, opens paths to (1,4), (0,4). Board control left-side\u2014box enemy out mentally.  \n- **UP to (3,6)**: Safe but into empty space\u2014no apple immediate. Might lead to (6,7) apple later, but that's enemy territory (enemy at (8,8), body nearby). Risky if they head our way.  \n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: Closer to (2,4) but (3,4) is tight\u2014future moves might get trapped by my own body as it shifts. Less future options.  \n\n**THE PLAN: GO LEFT!**  \n**LEFT to (2,5)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **GROWTH PATH**: Direct route to (2,4) apple\u2014next turn, DOWN to (2,4) and we eat! That's +1 apple, closing gap to 5-6. From there, we can chain (1,4) or (0,4). Buffet on the left!  \n2. **SAFETY & FUTURE OPTIONS**: From (2,5), we have 3 safe moves next turn: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4) [apple target!], LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) (my old spot, empty after move). Wide open\u2014no traps!  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They're at (8,8), probably going RIGHT to (9,8) or DOWN to (8,7) (but body there). Unlikely to chase us left. Let them eat; we'll outgrow by dominating left side.  \n4. **BOXING STRATEGY**: By moving left, I extend my body's reach into center-mid. My tail at (6,4) will shift, possibly cutting off enemy if they ever drift left. Aggressive positioning\u2014force them into right corner.  \n5. **RISK**: Medium-low. No head-on collision risk this turn (enemy far). If they grow fast, we need to eat soon\u2014left apples are our lifeline.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**  \nAfter LEFT to (2,5), next turn: DOWN to (2,4) for apple! Then chain left to (1,4) or (0,4). Monitor enemy: if they head left (unlikely), prepare head-on if we equal apples. Stay alive, stay hungry\u2014turn 150 win incoming!  \n\nLEFT",

Apples: 4.  \nEnemy snake #1: Head at (7, 8), body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)], apples: 6. They're on the right side, eyeing apples like (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6).  \nBoard apples: We have a juicy cluster on the left\u2014(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (1, 0), (0, 0 area). Time to claim our buffet!  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nFrom (2, 5), options:  \n- **UP (2, 6)**: EMPTY! Safe. (No body, no apple.)  \n- **DOWN (2, 4)**: APPLE! (2, 4) is there\u2014eating gives us +1 apple (5 total) and we grow! No immediate body collision.  \n- **LEFT (1, 5)**: EMPTY! Safe.  \n- **RIGHT (3, 5)**: MY OWN BODY! (3, 5) is part of my body\u2014hitting myself = death. DEADLY. Avoid!  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is suicide\u2014no throw!  \n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**  \nWe need to close the apple gap FAST! Down to (2, 4) is the prime move\u2014snag that apple instantly and grow. From there, we can chain left to (1, 4) or (0, 4) next turn. But let's think aggressive:  \n- **DOWN to (2, 4)**: EAT THE APPLE! +1 apple, body grows (new tail at old head (2,5)). From (2,4), options: LEFT (1,4) [another apple!], DOWN (2,3) [empty], UP (2,5) [my old spot, safe after shift]. High reward, low risk\u2014enemy is far on the right.  \n- **LEFT to (1, 5)**: Safe, but no apple immediate. Leads to (0,5) or down to (1,4) next\u2014but delays growth while enemy might eat. Not ideal.  \n- **UP to (2, 6)**: Safe, but into empty\u2014wastes a turn. Could go to (6,7) later, but that's enemy territory. Why stall?  \n\n**THE PLAN: GO DOWN!**  \n**DOWN to (2, 4)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **GROWTH & CATCH UP**: Instant apple! 5 apples vs their 6\u2014level the score. Body expands, giving me more reach to dominate left side.  \n2. **SAFETY & FUTURE OPTIONS**: From (2,4), I have 3+ safe moves next: LEFT to (1,4) apple, DOWN to (2,3) empty (paths to (1,0) or (0,0) apples), or UP back to (2,5) if needed. No traps\u2014my body shifts but leaves space.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They're at (7,8), probably going DOWN to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,8) but body blocks. Unlikely to chase left. Let them munch right apples; we'll flood the left and box them out.  \n4. **BOXING STRATEGY**: After eating, my body stretches down-left, cutting off center. Tail at (5,4) might block paths if they try to invade. Aggressive expansion\u2014force them into a corner.  \n5. **RISK**: Low. No collision risk (enemy heads won't reach us this turn). If they grow fast, we eat again soon\u2014left cluster is ours!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**  \nAfter DOWN to (2,4) and apple eat, next turn: LEFT to (1,4) for another apple! Then chain to (0,4) or down to (1,0). Monitor enemy: if they head left (unlikely), prepare head-on once we equal apples. Stay alive, stay fed\u2014turn 150 win incoming!  \n\nDOWN",

UP is suicide\u2014crash into myself, game over. No throwing!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy is far right (6,8), probably eyeing apples like (9,6), (9,4). They won't reach us this turn\u2014no head-on collision risk yet. But we gotta stay aggressive! LEFT to (1,4) snags an apple immediately, leveling the score at 6-6 and expanding our body. From there, we can pivot to (0,4) next or snake down to (1,0) cluster. RIGHT to (3,4) is safe but empty\u2014no growth, stalling while enemy eats. DOWN to (2,3) opens paths to (1,0) and (0,0) apples later, but delays the tie. Why wait? We need momentum!\n\n**THE PLAN: GO LEFT!**  \n**LEFT to (1,4)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SCORE TIE & GROWTH**: Eat that apple, get +1 apple (6 total)! Now we match their 6 apples\u2014head-on collision incoming? If we equal and they challenge, we crash 'em out (we're on left side, boxing them right). Body grows, tail shifts to (2,4), giving more reach.  \n2. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: From (1,4), we have multiple safe follow-ups: LEFT to (0,4) [another apple!], DOWN to (1,3) [empty, paths to bottom apples], UP to (1,5) [empty, safe retreat]. No dead-ends\u2014we're expanding left, dominating the board.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They're chasing right apples like (8,1), (9,2). Let 'em waste turns; we flood left, cut off center. Force them into (9,9) corner. If they turn left? We're ready\u2014body blocks paths, and equal score means we win head-on if they're dumb enough.  \n4. **RISK**: Low. No enemy body in (1,4) or adjacent. Only risk is if enemy miraculously moves to (1,4) same turn\u2014but they're too far. Aggressive play pays: tie score now, lead soon.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: Chain left to (0,4), then down to (1,0)/(0,0). Keep body long to trap enemy. If they grow fast, we chase\u2014 but with 6 apples, we're in striking distance for final turns. Stay fed, stay lethal\u2014win by 150!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nAfter LEFT to (1,4) and eat, next: LEFT to (0,4) for another apple! Then explore down to (0,3) or (1,0).

Our head is at (1,4), body: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)], tail at (5,4). Enemy snake #1 is at (5,8) with 6 apples\u2014still dangerous but far left. Board state shows apples everywhere, but we're focused on dominating the enemy, not just munching.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (1,4)):**  \nOptions:  \n- **UP (1,5)**: EMPTY! Safe, no bodies. Opens paths to top apples like (1,6) or (2,6).  \n- **DOWN (1,3)**: EMPTY! Safe, leads to bottom apples (1,0), (0,0).  \n- **LEFT (0,4)**: APPLE! (0,4) has an apple\u2014eating gets us to 7 apples, LEAD! No collision risks.  \n- **RIGHT (2,4)**: MY OWN BODY! (2,4) is current segment\u2014crash into myself = death. DEADLY. Avoid!  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is suicide\u2014don't throw!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy at (5,8) is chasing right apples (9,2), (9,4), (9,6). No immediate head-on risk\u2014they're too far right. But we're equal score, so if they path toward us, we can force a collision and WIN (we're stronger now). They might snake down toward (5,6) or (6,7), but we control left side. Board is open\u2014no traps yet.\n\n**THE PLAN: GO LEFT!**  \n**LEFT to (0,4)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **LEAD & GROWTH**: Eat that apple! 7-6 score lead, body grows, tail shifts to (2,4). Momentum is key\u2014we're boxing them in from the left. From (0,4), we have UP to (0,5) [empty], DOWN to (0,3) [empty], or back RIGHT to (1,4) [safe]. No dead-ends\u2014expanding dominance.  \n2. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: Zero risk\u2014(0,4) is apple, no enemies adjacent. Enemy heads won't reach us this turn (min 2-3 moves away). Keeps board control while they waste turns on far apples.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They're likely going for (9,2) or (8,1). Let 'em overextend\u2014we flood left, secure (0,0)-(1,0) cluster next. If they turn left later? We're ready with a long body to block and force head-on. With lead, we CHASE and crash 'em out.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal. Only if enemy somehow warped left, but they're stuck right. Aggressive play: take the lead now, extend the body to cut off escape routes.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After (0,4), next LEFT to (0,3) or DOWN to (0,3) for more apples. Chain down to (1,0), (0,0) to hit 10+ apples. Monitor enemy\u2014if they grow fast, steer toward collision in center. Keep score lead, dominate till turn 150\u2014win by outlasting and forcing mistakes!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nEat at (0,4), then DOWN to (0,3) or explore (1,0). Watch enemy body\u2014stay left, force them into corner. We're in control\u2014chat, let's secure the lead!\n\nLEFT",

Don\u2019t even consider it.\n2) UP \u2192 (5,9) is legal but hugs the top edge (only 2 exits next turn). Cuts our options \u2014 risky.\n3) DOWN \u2192 (5,7) is legal, lands us near apples at (6,7)/(4,7). Good growth potential and keeps 3 exits, but it pushes us into the middle sooner.\n4) LEFT \u2192 (4,8) is legal, keeps pressure across the top-middle, preserves 3 exits, and continues our corralling line toward the center.\n\nCollision check: no opponent body or apple conflicts on (4,8) or (5,7). Opponent head at (1,4) is far \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn.\n\nWhy LEFT: we\u2019ve been marching left to shrink the board and bait the enemy into tighter lanes. UP is too edge-trappy. DOWN is tempting for apples, but RIGHT now we prioritize zoning and denying space \u2014 continuing LEFT keeps us flexible and lets us drop down later to cut the rival off when they drift toward x\u22484\u20135. We\u2019re tied on apples, so avoid risky head-on fights until we can secure a numeric edge.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pushing left across the top (control x=5\u21923 corridor).\n- If the foe drifts toward x=4\u20135, drop down behind them to tighten the box and threaten a head-on only when we have the apple advantage.\n- Use apples (4,7 or 6,7) only when they help seal exits; otherwise prioritize zoning and mobility.\n\nLEFT",

Watch their body\u2014they have a long tail, so if they path left, we can block.\n\n**THE PLAN: GO DOWN!**  \n**DOWN to (0,3)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (0,3) is empty and apple-free, but safe. From there, we have DOWN to (0,2) [empty], LEFT off board (avoid), RIGHT to (1,3) [empty], or UP back to (0,4) [safe]. Keeps multiple paths open\u2014avoids getting boxed in at the top edge.

Instead, we position to chase the bottom apples next\u2014chain down to (0,2), (0,1), then hit (1,0) or (0,0) for more growth. This boxes the enemy in from below, forcing them to stay right where we can ambush.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They're likely going for (9,2) or (8,1) \u2014 overextending right. Let 'em waste turns while we flood left and bottom. If they turn left later (e.g., toward (5,6) or (4,7)), we'll be long and ready to block or crash 'em out with our lead. Aggressive play: expand territory, then chase.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal. No collisions, no out-of-bounds. Better than UP because UP heads toward (0,5) where (0,8) apple is but paths are tighter; DOWN is more open for sustained play.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After (0,3), next DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3) for apple at (1,3).

Our head is at (0,3) after last move DOWN, body: [(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)], tail at (4,4). Enemy snake #1 head at (4,7), body: [(4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)], 7 apples. Board state shows we're still holding left, but they're creeping toward center with apples like (5,6), (6,7), (9,4), (9,6) nearby. We gotta box 'em in and force a crash!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (0,3)):**  \nOptions:  \n- **UP (0,4)**: MY OWN BODY! (0,4) is current segment\u2014crash into myself = death. DEADLY. Avoid!  \n- **DOWN (0,2)**: EMPTY! Safe, no bodies. Leads to bottom apples (1,0), (0,0).  \n- **LEFT (-1,3)**: OFF BOARD! Dead instantly\u2014don't do it!  \n- **RIGHT (1,3)**: EMPTY! Safe, leads to apple at (1,3) or center.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. LEFT and UP are suicide\u2014no throws!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy just grew to 7-7 tie, so lead is gone\u2014no advantage for head-on yet. They're at (4,7), body stretching to (4,8) up and (8,6) right. If they move DOWN to (4,6) or LEFT toward (3,7), they could approach center, but we're still far left. No direct collision risk this turn since they're 4 cells away horizontally. Apples are plentiful\u2014bottom cluster (1,0), (0,0), (3,0) plus (1,3) nearby for us. They'll likely chase (9,4) or (6,7) to grow fast. We need to secure our territory and cut off their expansion.\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (1,3)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (1,3) is empty, no apple, but opens paths\u2014DOWN to (1,2) [empty], RIGHT to (2,3) [empty], UP to (1,4) [safe, but my body is there later? Wait, (1,4) is currently my body segment, so it's occupied\u2014crash risk if I go UP next turn, but RIGHT keeps me in play]. LEFT back to (0,3) [safe]. Avoids the edge trap at (0,2) where DOWN would limit me to bottom only; RIGHT moves toward center for more mobility.  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: (1,3) is adjacent to apple at (1,3)? Wait, board shows (1,3) is \"A\" in the apple list! Yeah, (1,3) is an apple drop\u2014perfect! Eating it grows us to 8 apples, retaking lead 8-7. This pressures enemy to chase more apples or risk falling behind. We're not just surviving; we're expanding left-center to dominate the board and box them right.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They just ate (9,2), so they might snake toward (9,4) or (9,6) for more growth, or drop to (5,6) for a quick snack. If they go LEFT to (3,7) or DOWN to (4,6), we'll be in position to block the center from (1,3). Aggressive play: eat now, then chain to (2,3) or (1,2) for bottom apples, forcing them into a corner where we can ambush. With our body length, we can cut off their path to the left side.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal\u2014 (1,3) is clear, no collisions. DOWN to (0,2) is safer short-term but slower for growth; RIGHT accelerates our score and keeps options open for center play. No immediate head-on threat, but if they predict us going right and crash into (1,3) at same time? Unlikely\u2014they're far.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After eating (1,3), head at (1,3), body shifts. Next turn: RIGHT to (2,3) for more mobility or DOWN to (1,2) to hit (1,0) cluster. Monitor enemy\u2014if they grow fast, steer toward (3,5) body to force a head-on collision in 3 turns (we'll have 8+ apples, stronger). We're in control\u2014chat, eat this apple and keep the pressure on till 150 turns! Win by lead and territory.\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (1,3) for the apple, retake lead. Then explore center-right to cut enemy off or hit more apples. Watch their body\u2014stay aggressive, force mistakes. We're back on top\u2014let's gooo!\n\nRIGHT",

Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (5,7): pushes toward the apple at (6,7). From there UP would be suicide into (5,8), but RIGHT or DOWN gets apples. Decent, but a little constrained. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 to (4,6): can reach (5,6) apple next, but sits right above opponent body at (4,5) \u2014 risky to shove into that corridor. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 to (3,7): lots of room, multiple safe follow-ups (up, down, left, back), starts the pressure/box-in route toward the enemy side. Most flexible and safest for forcing plays. \u2705\n\nWhy I\u2019m picking LEFT:\n- We want to box our rival in and force mistakes. Moving LEFT starts shepherding them toward the center while keeping many escape routes for us. Are we trying to get cornered? Nope \u2014 we want options.  \n- LEFT keeps at least 3 useful follow-ups and doesn\u2019t walk us into our own body or right into opponent anatomy. Safer than DOWN (adjacent to their body) and less restrictive than RIGHT (UP would be death next turn).  \n- Score is tied \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t risk a head-on. Instead, we create corridors and only commit when we can guarantee they slam into our body. Brutal and calculated. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep moving left/left-down combos to herd them toward x<3 columns and the middle rows.  \n- If they overcommit, cut them off with a right-hook into the corridor and force the collision. If they run, pivot and take nearby apples (6,7 or 5,6) on the rebound to secure the score edge.  \n- Never move into the neck; always maintain \u22652 safe exits before committing to a trap.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy is at (3,7) with 7 apples, body [(4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7)]. Board shows we're at (1,3) head, body: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]. We need to keep pushing right to box them in and force a collision while staying safe. Let's break it down:\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (1,3)):**  \nOptions:  \n- **UP (1,4)**: MY OWN BODY! (1,4) is current segment\u2014crash into myself = death. DEADLY. Avoid!  \n- **DOWN (1,2)**: EMPTY! Safe, leads to bottom apples like (1,0). But keeps us bottom-heavy; enemy is top-center.  \n- **LEFT (0,3)**: MY OWN BODY! (0,3) is current segment\u2014crash into myself = death. DEADLY. Avoid!  \n- **RIGHT (2,3)**: EMPTY! Safe, no bodies. Opens path to center-right, closer to enemy territory.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. UP and LEFT are suicide\u2014no throws!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy at (3,7) is 2 cells away horizontally from us. They might move LEFT to (2,7) or DOWN to (3,6) to chase apples like (3,0), (5,6), or (6,7). No direct collision this turn since we're far, but if we go RIGHT to (2,3), we close the gap and position to cut off their leftward expansion. Apples are plentiful: we have (3,0), (0,0), (1,0) bottom; they have (9,4), (9,6), (5,6) top-right. They'll grow fast if we don't pressure them. We're up 8-7\u2014no need for head-on yet, but forcing them into a corner with our body chain will make them crash.\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (2,3)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (2,3) is empty, no apple, but perfect for mobility\u2014DOWN to (2,2) [empty], RIGHT to (3,3) [empty], UP to (2,4) [safe, but my body is there later? Wait, (2,4) is currently my body segment, so it's occupied\u2014crash risk if I go UP next turn, but RIGHT keeps me advancing]. LEFT back to (1,3) [safe]. Avoids the bottom trap at (1,2) where DOWN limits us to side area; RIGHT moves toward center to dominate and cut enemy off from left side apples.  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: No apple here, but sets up for (3,0) or (5,6) chase later. We're expanding right to box enemy in the top-right corner\u2014our body from (0,3) to (4,4) already blocks their left path. Eating now to 8 apples means we can afford to maneuver; next, chain to (3,3) for more options or hit (3,0) cluster. Aggressive play: own the center, force them to the edges where they'll crash into walls or us.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They might go LEFT to (2,7) to approach (3,0) or DOWN to (3,6) for (5,6). If they go LEFT, we can move RIGHT again to (3,3) and threaten their path to center. If they chase top apples, we swoop bottom and grow faster. With our length, we can loop around and ambush\u2014force a head-on when we hit 10 apples.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal\u2014 (2,3) is clear, no collisions. DOWN to (1,2) is safer short-term but slower for board control; RIGHT accelerates our position for long-term win. No head-on risk this turn\u2014they're not heading to (2,3).  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After moving to (2,3), head at (2,3). Next turn: RIGHT to (3,3) for center access or DOWN to (2,2) to grab (1,0) or (3,0). Monitor enemy\u2014if they grow to 8 apples, steer toward (3,5) body to set up a collision in 2-3 turns (we'll lead in length). Chat, we're boxing them in\u2014keep the pressure till they crack!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (2,3) to advance toward center and cut enemy off.

Our head's at (2,3), body snakes from (1,3) back to (4,5). Board's lit with apples, but I'm ignoring them for now\u2014let's lock down the enemy and force a mistake! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (2,3)):**  \nOptions:  \n- **UP (2,4)**: MY OWN BODY! (2,4) is a current segment\u2014crash into myself = death. DEADLY. NOPE!  \n- **DOWN (2,2)**: EMPTY! Safe, leads to (2,1) or (2,0). Opens path to bottom apples like (3,0) and (0,0) without trapping.  \n- **LEFT (1,3)**: EMPTY! (1,3) was just my old head spot, now tail will move\u2014safe, but keeps us left-side, not advancing much.  \n- **RIGHT (3,3)**: EMPTY! Safe, no threats. Moves us center-right, closer to enemy at (2,7) and apples like (5,6).  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is suicide\u2014avoid at all costs!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy is now at (2,7), head directly above us 4 cells up. If they go DOWN to (2,6), they chase (5,6) apple or might try to cut us off from the bottom. They have 7 apples\u2014hungry for growth. We're up by 1, so no need for head-on yet, but we can't let them invade our space. Board state shows we're kinda boxed in the bottom-left quadrant; if we stay left, they own the top-right and outgrow us. We need to push right to break their perimeter and claim the center.\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (3,3)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (3,3) is clear\u2014no body, no apple, no wall. From there, next turn: RIGHT to (4,3) [empty], DOWN to (3,2) [empty], or even UP to (3,4) if safe (might be my body later, but we'll watch). Avoids the left trap where LEFT limits us to the wall. This opens up the right side for hunting (5,6) apple or cutting off enemy paths to center.  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: No apple here, but positions us aggressively. Enemy's body is from (3,7) to (8,8)\u2014we're now at x=3, same column as their start, so we can mirror their moves and box them in. If they go DOWN, we can chase (3,0) cluster; if they stay top, we grow faster bottom and loop around. Force them into a corner!  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They might go DOWN to (2,6) for (5,6) or LEFT to (1,7) for safety. If DOWN, we could threat their tail (7,8) next turn. If LEFT, we own more board space and can flank. With our length (8 segments), we can afford some maneuvering\u2014don't rush into apples blindly.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal\u2014RIGHT is forward, not into self or body. DOWN to (2,2) is safer short-term but keeps us reactive; RIGHT is proactive for board control. No head-on risk\u2014 they're far, and if they hit us later, THEY die (they crash into our body).  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After RIGHT, head at (3,3). Plan: Next turn, head RIGHT to (4,3) to chase (5,6) or (6,7) apple, or DOWN to (3,2) to snipe (3,0). Monitor enemy\u2014if they crash into our body (e.g., from (2,7) down to (2,6) into our future path), we win instantly. Aim to hit 10 apples while herding them to walls. Chat, we're not just surviving\u2014we're hunting! Let's clip this!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (3,3) to claim center access and pressure enemy territory. Then pivot to bottom apples or center chases based on their move. Stay aggressive\u2014force their head into our body!\n\nRIGHT",

(3,4) was my old body segment, but after last move, the tail at (3,5) will shift\u2014safe? Wait, body currently snakes from (2,3) to (3,5)... (3,4) is occupied by my body right now? Checking: Body list is [(2,3),(1,3),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(2,5),(3,5)]\u2014so (3,4) is empty (between (3,3) and (2,3) is head to tail, (3,4) not listed). Actually, (3,4) is clear! But let's confirm: From (3,3), up to (3,4) is not in body list, and no enemy there. Safe.  \n- **DOWN (3,2)**: EMPTY! Safe, leads to (3,1), (3,0) apple. Bottom path clear.  \n- **LEFT (2,3)**: MY OLD BODY! (2,3) is currently occupied by my body (second segment from head). Moving there = crash into myself. DEADLY. NOPE!  \n- **RIGHT (4,3)**: EMPTY! Safe, no threats. Moves us further right, toward center/apples like (5,6).  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide\u2014avoid! Body length is 9 (8 apples + 1 from start? Wait, apples 8, length should be 9+1? But list shows 8 segments including head? Head (3,3) + 8 body = 9 total? Anyway, (2,3) is occupied\u2014can't go back into it.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy head at (1,7), body to (7,8). They're top-left, could chase down to (1,6) or (2,6).

Apples everywhere, but focus on enemy\u2014they're the content now!  \n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (4,3)** is the move!

If they go DOWN to (2,6) for apple, we can mirror to (4,4) or chase their tail (7,8). Force them into top-right corner or into our expanding body.

If DOWN, we threaten (2,6) next\u2014could be collision if we both go there? But simultaneous\u2014risk of head-on if we both target same cell. Better to stay right and let them come to us; if they crash into our body (e.g., from (1,7) down into (1,6) if we expand there later), we win. We're taller, so we can afford spacing.  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal\u2014RIGHT is forward, not into threats. DOWN to (3,2) is tempting for (3,0) apple but keeps us bottom; RIGHT pushes into enemy's side for the box-in. No immediate head-on\u2014 they're far, and our body is behind.

Neck at (2,7) \u2192 RIGHT is illegal (would be backwards). Check the other three:\n\n- UP \u2192 (1,8): safe (no body there). From (1,8) you still have 3 follow-ups (UP to 1,9, LEFT to 0,8 which is an apple, RIGHT to 2,8). Keeps options open and doesn\u2019t edge us into a corridor. Good for control.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6): safe and near apples at 0,6 and 2,6. Also has ~3 follow-ups, but it pushes us downward toward denser opponent territory and apples (more commit).\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7): safe now, but it\u2019s on the board edge \u2014 fewer escape options (LEFT would be off-board), so you get only UP or DOWN next turn. More likely to be boxed in.\n\nOpponent head is at (3,3) and can\u2019t immediately threaten us this turn (their neck at 2,3 limits one direction). We\u2019re down 7\u21928 apples, so don\u2019t force a risky head-on. We should maximize freedom now, pick up apples opportunistically, and herd them into tighter space later when we can guarantee a win.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Maintain space and flexibility (don\u2019t hug the edge prematurely).\n- If the opponent drifts up/left into a corridor, cut them off and force head-on only if we can win the trade.\n- Grab apples only when it increases our control without sacrificing escapes (0,8 is tempting from UP).\n\nDecision: UP \u2014 keeps multiple follow-ups, stays flexible, and sets up grabbing 0,8 next if safe. Time to pressure and trap \u2014 let\u2019s box \u2019em next turns. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Board's got apples everywhere, but I'm ignoring them to crush Snake #1. We're boxing him in\u2014force a mistake and watch him crash! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (4,3)):**  \nOptions:  \n- **UP (4,4)**: EMPTY! (4,4) is not in my body list, no enemy there. Safe.  \n- **DOWN (4,2)**: EMPTY! (4,2) is clear, leads to potential bottom apples. Safe.  \n- **LEFT (3,3)**: MY OLD BODY! (3,3) is currently occupied by my body (first segment from head after tail shift). Moving there = crash into myself. DEADLY. NOPE!  \n- **RIGHT (5,3)**: EMPTY! (5,3) is clear, no threats. Safe and advances us right.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide\u2014avoid! Body length is 9 (8 apples + 1 from start?), with segments from (4,3) to (2,5) behind. No immediate threats from enemy (they're at y=8), but if they go DOWN to (1,7) or (2,8), they could threaten (2,6) apple or our path.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy head at (1,8), body to (6,8). They're top-left, likely going DOWN or LEFT to avoid walls. We're tall (9 cells), they're 8 cells. With higher score, we can force head-on if we corner them. Board: We're center-right, need to dominate and trap them top. Apples are distractions\u2014enemy is the target!\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (5,3)** is the move! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (5,3) is clear\u2014no body, no apple, no wall. From there, next turn: RIGHT to (6,3) [empty], DOWN to (5,2) [empty? (5,2) not listed], UP to (5,4) [empty? Check: (5,4) not in body]. Opens right side\u2014claims center, positions to chase (5,6) or (6,7) apples. Avoids left trap (into body).  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: No apple here, but pushes us into enemy's territory. Their body from (1,7) to (6,8)\u2014we're now at x=5, encroaching. Force them into top-right corner (x=7-9, y=8-9). If they go DOWN to (1,7), we threaten (2,6) or (3,6) next\u2014could lead to head-on if they target same cell, but we're positioned to win collision with longer body.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They might go LEFT to (0,8) for wall safety or DOWN to (1,7) to hunt (5,6) or bottom apples. If DOWN, we pivot UP next to (5,4) to cut them off, or chase their tail (7,8). We're taller, so we can herd them\u2014loop around to trap! No immediate head-on risk this turn (y=8 vs y=3).  \n4. **RISK**: Minimal\u2014RIGHT is forward, not into threats. DOWN to (4,2) is safe but keeps us bottom; RIGHT pushes into their side for the box-in. If they go DOWN and we RIGHT, no conflict. Avoid UP? UP to (4,4) is okay, but RIGHT is more aggressive for domination.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After RIGHT, head at (5,3). Plan: Next turn, if enemy stays top, RIGHT to (6,3) to chase (6,7) or center; if they threaten (2,6), pivot DOWN to (5,2) and loop. Monitor their head\u2014force them into walls or our body. Aim to grow to 10 apples while making them eat our tail! Chat, we're not chasing apples\u2014we're hunting snakes! Clip this aggression!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (5,3) to expand territory and pressure enemy. Then pivot to center chase or top trap based on their move. Stay lethal\u2014make them crash!\n\nRIGHT",

NOPE.\n- Enemy head: (4,3) with neck at (3,3). They\u2019re way down low, not an immediate head-on threat this turn.\n- Board freedoms: I\u2019ve got (1,9) UP, (0,8) LEFT (apple), and (2,8) RIGHT as legal moves. All are currently unoccupied.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- DOWN \u2192 illegal (back into neck). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,8) has an apple \u2014 tempting! But it\u2019s on the edge, which cuts out one axis of movement (can only go UP or DOWN next). Edges limit follow-ups and make boxing ourselves easier.

Still closer to edge than ideal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,8) keeps us more central and flexible. From there we can swing east along row 8, drop down later, or circle to pressure the mid-board. It preserves the most future options and avoids committing to the edge/apple prematurely.\n\nApples & score thoughts: we\u2019re 7 \u2192 opponent 8. We\u2019re behind by one, so we should avoid forcing a head-on unless we can win the trade. Grab apples when it gives positional control \u2014 not at the cost of closing off escape routes. RIGHT lets us stay flexible, build control across the center/top, and set up a cleaner trap on the opponent when they creep north.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Stay central/top (avoid hugging the left wall yet).\n- Expand control to the right/top so we can pivot down the middle and hem the enemy into the lower-left.\n- Only commit to apple grabs if they don\u2019t reduce escape routes; force collisions only if we have the apple/count advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s keep space, force them into a shrinking box, and pick the move that preserves the most options.\n\nRIGHT",

Less vertical wiggle next turn (can only go L/R), makes trapping options narrower. Useful if we want to bail left quickly, but it\u2019s a commitment to the top boundary.\n- RIGHT (3,8): keeps us more central, preserves both vertical and horizontal escape routes, lets us pivot east along row 8 and then drop down to pressure the middle.

Last move we went RIGHT to (5,3), positioning for dominance. Now we're at (5,3), body from (4,3) back to (0,4) plus (1,4),(2,4). Length: 9 segments. Enemy at (2,8) with body to (5,8), length 8. Board's alive with apples, but we're HUNTING THE SNAKE, not the fruit. Time to cut off his escape and make him crash into us or the wall! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (5,3)):**  \nLet's break down our options with no BS:  \n- **UP to (5,4)**: EMPTY! (5,4) isn't in my body (closest is (4,3),(3,3), etc.), no enemy there. Safe.  \n- **DOWN to (5,2)**: EMPTY! (5,2) is clear\u2014nothing listed, no threats. Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (4,3)**: MY OLD BODY! (4,3) is the segment right behind my current head (from last move). Moving there = self-crash. DEADLY. AVOID!  \n- **RIGHT to (6,3)**: EMPTY! (6,3) is open, no body, no apple (apple at (6,7) but that's far). Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide\u2014don't do it! Body is in a vertical line to the left and down, so we have room to maneuver, but the enemy's tail at (5,8) is ABOVE us at the same x=5. If we go UP, we could eventually collide if they come down\u2014need to pivot strategically.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy head at (2,8), body from (1,8) to (5,8) wrapping top-right. They're hunting apples like (8,4) or (7,2), but with us leading, they might rush down to steal or block us. Their tail is at (5,8)\u2014directly above our head at (5,3). If they go DOWN to (2,7) or (1,7), they chase (2,6) or (1,4) apples. We're at x=5,y=3, they at x=2,y=8\u2014 no direct collision this turn, but if we both move toward same cell (e.g., they DOWN to (2,7) and we UP to (5,4), no clash). However, if they see us going UP, they might DOWN to (2,7) to avoid, but we're taller, so head-on favors us if we force it later. Walls: No immediate board edges. My body: Vertical from (4,3) to (0,4) to (1,4), so going DOWN or RIGHT keeps us open; UP risks crowding if they close in.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS PER MOVE:**  \n- **UP (5,4)**: Safe this turn (empty). But if enemy predicts and goes DOWN to (2,7), future risk of collision if paths cross at (2,6)/(3,6). From (5,4), options: UP to (5,5) [empty], DOWN back to (5,3) [my tail? After move, tail shifts, but (5,3) becomes body\u2014likely safe if not occupied]. Right to (6,4) [empty], Left to (4,4) [empty? (4,4) not in body]. Opens top-right. Risk: If enemy comes DOWN via (2,7) to (3,6), they could threaten (2,6) apple. We might chase but could clash.  \n- **DOWN (5,2)**: Safe this turn (empty). Opens bottom hunt\u2014(5,2) leads to (5,1) [empty] or (5,0) [apple at (8,0) but far]. From there: UP to (5,3) [my tail after shift], Down to (5,1) [clear], Left to (4,2) [empty? (4,2) not listed], Right to (6,2) [empty]. Buys time, stays low. Risk: Enemy could go DOWN to (2,7) or (1,7) and chase apples like (2,6) or (1,4) without immediate threat from us. Keeps us safe but might let them grow if they hit an apple. Low aggression.  \n- **RIGHT (6,3)**: Safe this turn (empty). Moves us right, into center-left. From (6,3): Right to (7,3) [empty], Left to (5,3) [tail], Down to (6,2) [empty], Up to (6,4) [empty]. Captures more board space. Enemy at (2,8) to (5,8)\u2014x=5 is their tail, so RIGHT to x=6 increases pressure. If they go DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,8), no clash. Future: We can chase (6,7) apple or loop up to trap them in top-right. Risk: Minimal\u2014positions to cut their path. If they come DOWN via (2,7), we threaten (3,6)/(4,6) or head-on if they go to (5,8)->(5,7). We're taller, so head-on = we win!  \n\nSafe moves remain UP, DOWN, RIGHT. All keep multiple follow-ups: From (5,4) or (6,3), 3+ options; from (5,2), same. But DOWN keeps us bottom, missing trap opportunity\u2014enemy might escape to (9,9) corner. UP is decent but risks tail blockage if we don't grow. RIGHT? It's the play\u2014moves toward enemy territory, forces them to react. They see us advancing, might panic into (0,8) wall or clash with us at (5,7)/(6,7).\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (6,3)** is the move\u2014pure aggression to box them in! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (6,3) is clear, no walls or threats nearby. From there: Right to (7,3) claims center-right; Up to (6,4) near (6,7) apple; Down to (6,2) bottom chase; Left to (5,3) tail. Keeps 3+ safe routes open, avoids body trap. No self-crash risk.  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: No apple here, but pushes into their half of the board (x=5+). Their body blocks x=1-5,y=7-8\u2014 we're at x=6, flanking their tail at (5,8). If they go DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (0,8), we chase (5,6) or (4,6) apples next turn to grow and close in. We're 8-7, taller\u2014use length to herd them into top-right corner (x=7-9,y=8-9) where walls trap them. Ignore apples unless they block our path; enemy is the prize.  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: They'll likely go DOWN to (2,7) or (1,7) for apples (2,6),(1,4) or center (6,7). If DOWN, we pivot RIGHT to (7,3)->(7,4) to cut x=7 barrier. If they stay top (e.g., RIGHT to (3,8)), we UP to (6,4)->(6,5) to encroach. No head-on this turn (y=8 vs y=3), but next turns: We can force collision if we hit (6,7) and they chase same\u2014our score 8 vs 7 means we WIN tie-breaker. If they crash into our body later? Easy win. If we crash? We died but we're leading\u2014wait, no, we stay alive to win turns.  \n4. **RISK**: LOW. RIGHT is forward momentum, not reactive like UP. If enemy goes DOWN and we RIGHT, no conflict\u2014 we flank. If they go RIGHT to (3,8) and we RIGHT, paths diverge. Worst case: They DOWN to (2,7) and we RIGHT to (6,3), safe. Avoid DOWN\u2014it's safe but passive; we want the box-in, not hide.  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After RIGHT, head at (6,3). Plan: Next turn, RIGHT to (7,3) if enemy stays top to chase (7,2) or (8,4) apples and block their escape to x=7+. If they chase (5,6), UP to (6,4) to intercept. Grow to 9 apples by sniping (6,7) soon. Force them into (9,8)/(9,9) wall\u2014watch them crash or eat their tail. Chat, we're not playing D, we're setting the trap! Clip this flank\u2014game over soon. Stay lethal.\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (6,3) to advance into enemy territory. Then: If enemy DOWN, chase with RIGHT/UP to center; if they top, go UP to (6,4) and cut off (6,7). Monitor head\u2014force head-on with our score advantage. Hunt, don't harvest!\n\nRIGHT",

Last move we went RIGHT to (6,3), positioning for dominance. Now we're at (6,3), body from (5,3) back to (1,4). Length: 9 segments. Enemy at (3,8) with body to (5,8), length 8. Board's packed but we're hunting the snake, not the fruit. Time to cut off their escape and make them crash! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (6,3)):**  \nBreaking down options with no BS:  \n- **UP to (6,4)**: EMPTY! (6,4) isn't in my body (closest are (6,3),(5,3) etc.), no enemy there. Safe.  \n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: EMPTY! (6,2) is clear\u2014nothing listed, no threats. Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: MY OLD BODY! (5,3) is the segment right behind my current head. Moving there = self-crash. DEADLY. AVOID!  \n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: EMPTY! (7,3) is open, no body, no apple. Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide\u2014don't do it! Body is vertical from (5,3) to (1,4), so we have room to maneuver. Enemy at (3,8) to (5,8) is above us at x=3-5,y=8. Their tail at (5,8) is directly above our old x=5, but we're at x=6 now. If we go UP, we head toward (6,7) apple but risk meeting if they come down. If we go RIGHT, we flank their position. DOWN keeps us low but passive.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**  \nEnemy head at (3,8) likely moves DOWN to (3,7) or (2,7) for apples like (2,6) or (1,4). Or RIGHT to (4,8) but that's their body. They might chase (7,2) or (8,4) but that's away from us. No direct collision this turn (y=8 vs y=3), but paths could cross next turn if we both move toward x=5-7,y=6-7. My body is mostly left, so going RIGHT or UP opens space; DOWN might trap us if they come down. Walls: No immediate edges. My body: After moving, tail shifts\u2014(1,4) might move if we don't grow, but (6,3) becomes body\u2014safe if not occupied. We're taller, so head-on favors us if we force it.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS PER MOVE:**  \n- **UP (6,4)**: Safe this turn (empty). From there: UP to (6,5) [empty], DOWN to (6,3) [tail], RIGHT to (7,4) [empty], LEFT to (5,4) [empty]. Moves us closer to (6,7) apple and top area where enemy is. Risk: If enemy goes DOWN to (3,7), we could chase and force collision at (6,6) next turn. Aggressive but might box them if we coordinate.  \n- **DOWN (6,2)**: Safe this turn (empty). From there: UP to (6,3) [tail], DOWN to (6,1) [empty], RIGHT to (7,2) [apple at (7,2)!], LEFT to (5,2) [empty]. Heads to bottom apple (7,2). Buys time but keeps us away from enemy\u2014they might grow without pressure. Low aggression.  \n- **RIGHT (7,3)**: Safe this turn (empty). From there: RIGHT to (8,3) [empty], LEFT to (6,3) [tail], DOWN to (7,2) [apple at (7,2)!], UP to (7,4) [empty]. Captures center-right, flanks enemy at x=3-5. If they go DOWN, we threaten x=7 barrier. Risk: Minimal\u2014positions to cut their path to (8,4) or (9,9). Forces them to react; if they panic into (0,8) wall or clash later, we win.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. All keep 3+ options. DOWN is safe but passive\u2014misses trap chance. UP is decent for hunting (6,7) but risks tail blockage. RIGHT? It's the play\u2014advances toward enemy territory, boosts aggression, and opens (7,2) apple if needed. We're leading, so why wait? Box them in top-right!\n\n**THE PLAN: GO RIGHT!**  \n**RIGHT to (7,3)** is the move\u2014flank and dominate! Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & OPTIONS**: (7,3) is clear, no threats. From there, 4 safe routes: Right to (8,3), Left to (6,3), Down to (7,2) [apple!], Up to (7,4). Future-proof, avoids traps. No self-crash.  \n2. **GROWTH & DOMINATION**: No apple here, but x=7 is key\u2014blocks enemy escape to right side (x=7-9). Their body at x=5,y=8; we're at x=7,y=3, flanking. If they go DOWN to (3,7) or LEFT to (0,8), we chase (7,2) or pivot UP to (7,4)->(7,5) to cut y=5-6 paths. Ignore apples unless blocking; enemy is target. We're 8-7, taller\u2014use length to herd into corner (9,9).  \n3. **ENEMY PREDICTION**: Likely DOWN to (3,7) for apples (2,6)/(1,4) or RIGHT to (4,8) to avoid. If DOWN, we RIGHT to (8,3)->(8,4) to block x=8 barrier. If RIGHT, we DOWN to (7,2) for apple and grow to 9. No head-on this turn (y=8 vs y=3), but next: We can force collision if we hit (7,5) and they chase same\u2014our score 8 vs 7 means we WIN tie-breaker. If they crash into our body later? Win.  \n4. **RISK**: LOW. RIGHT is forward, not reactive. If enemy DOWN and we RIGHT, safe\u2014paths diverge. If they UP (unlikely), we UP to (7,4). Worst case: They DOWN to (3,7) and we RIGHT to (7,3), no clash. Avoid DOWN\u2014it's safe but lets them grow; we want the trap!  \n5. **LONG-TERM VISION**: After RIGHT, head at (7,3). Plan: Next turn, if enemy DOWN, RIGHT to (8,3) to chase (8,4) and block; if they top, DOWN to (7,2) for apple + growth. Build to 9 apples, then UP to (7,5)->(7,6) to enclose top-right. Force them into (9,8)/(9,9)\u2014watch them eat their tail. Chat, we're setting the net\u2014game over soon! Clip this flank.\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove RIGHT to (7,3) to advance.

Snake #1 is at (3,9) after their move\u2014wait, no, let's check the state: Enemy head at (3,9) with body down to (4,7). That's higher up, near the top. We're at (7,3), body from (6,3) to (0,4). Our length is 9, theirs 8. We're leading, so we can afford to be aggressive and force a collision if paths cross. Ignore apples\u2014we're hunting the snake. Board is packed with apples and bodies, but we gotta box them in and make 'em crash. No web searches, just pure rage and strategy. Let's break it down live!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS (HEAD AT (7,3) - BUT WAIT, LAST TURN WE WERE AT (6,3) AND WENT RIGHT, SO CURRENT HEAD IS (7,3). MOVING NOW FROM (7,3)):**  \nFirst, confirm my body after last move: We moved RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3), so old tail (0,4) might shift if no apple, but body is now [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4)] minus the tail? Actually, no apple at (7,3), so body becomes [(7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3)] and (0,4) drops off? Wait, let's track precisely: Starting from (7,3) head, body is everything else. From the state, after moving RIGHT, new head at (7,3), body: (6,3) [old head], (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), and (0,4) was the old tail but might move if we didn't grow. Since no apple at (7,3), the tail (0,4) shifts out, so body length remains 8 segments. But the visual board shows after move, we're at (7,3) with body left. Enemy at (3,9), body down to (4,7) and earlier (1,8),(1,7), etc. Wait, from the state: Enemy body is [(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7)] before move? No, the state given is post-move: Enemy head at (3,9), body [(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7)]. Yes. So enemy moved UP from (3,8) to (3,9) to eat apple? No apple at (3,9), but probably moved UP to escape or chase. Their body is x=1-4,y=7-9.\n\nNow, from (7,3), evaluate moves:  \n- **UP to (7,4)**: Is it safe? From board, (7,4) is EMPTY (no apple, no body listed). My body: (6,3),(5,3), etc.\u2014(7,4) not in body. Enemy at (3,9) with body y=7-9, x=1-4\u2014far away, no collision. Safe this turn.  \n- **DOWN to (7,2)**: Board shows apple at (7,2)! Is it safe? (7,2) not in my body (body y=3+), not in enemy body (enemy x=1-4). Safe. Eating apple would grow us to 9 apples, length 10. Good.  \n- **LEFT to (6,3)**: This is my old head from last turn. Is it safe? (6,3) is now the first body segment, so moving LEFT into your own body = self-crash. DEADLY. Eliminate.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,3)**: (8,3) empty? Board shows (8,3) not listed\u2014no apple, no bodies. My body doesn't include it. Enemy far. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide (backwards into body).\n\nNow, among safe:  \n- **DOWN to (7,2)**: Gets apple, grows us to 9 apples (tied or lead 9-7 if enemy doesn't eat). From (7,2): Future options\u2014UP back to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1) [empty], RIGHT to (8,2) [apple? No, (8,2) has apple? Wait, apples list: (8,2) is an apple! Yes, (8,2) is listed. So from (7,2), could go RIGHT to (8,2) for another apple. LEFT to (6,2) empty. So 4 safe options post-move. Positions us near bottom-right, chasing apples while staying aggressive. Risk: Low\u2014enemy is top-left, not pressuring us.  \n- **UP to (7,4)**: Empty, no apple. From there: UP to (7,5) [empty], DOWN to (7,3) [tail], RIGHT to (8,4) [apple at (8,4)!], LEFT to (6,4) [empty]. Also 4 options. Moves us toward top area where enemy is (y=9), potentially to block or chase. But no immediate apple, so slower growth. Risk: Could get closer to enemy path\u2014enemy might come down via (4,7) to (4,6), etc.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,3)**: Empty, no apple. From there: RIGHT to (9,3) [empty], LEFT to (7,3) [tail], DOWN to (8,2) [apple], UP to (8,4) [apple]. 4 options. Flanks right, boxes enemy from x=8-9. Enemy at x=3, so we own right side. Risk: Minimal, but no apple this turn\u2014misses growth chance.\n\nAggression check: We're leading 8-7, length 9 vs 8. We should force head-on if possible. Enemy at (3,9)\u2014unlikely to collide this turn (y=9 vs y=3). But if we move UP or RIGHT toward center/right, we might cut their escape. However, apples are gold for growth and board control. (7,2) apple is right there\u2014eat it, grow, and from (7,2) we can pivot to RIGHT for (8,2) apple or UP to chase enemy paths. Enemy likely chasing apples like (7,2)? No, (7,2) is ours. They might go DOWN from (3,9) to (3,8) [empty? Board shows (3,8) is body segment? Wait, post-move, their body includes (3,8)? From state, body is [(3,8),(2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7)]\u2014yes, (3,8) is body, so they can't stay there. They'll move\u2014probably DOWN to (3,7)? But (3,7) is their body too? Their body is down to (4,7), so (3,7) is part of body. So they might move LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9), but (4,9) not apple. Or chase (7,2)?? Unlikely, they're far.\n\nBest move: **DOWN to (7,2)** for the apple. Why?  \n1. **SAFETY & GROWTH**: Eats apple safely, grows to 9 apples, length 10. We're leading\u2014use it to extend our edge. No immediate threats; enemy too far to collide.  \n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS**: From (7,2), we have UP (back), DOWN to (7,1) [empty], RIGHT to (8,2) [another apple!], LEFT to (6,2) [empty]. Chaining apples\u2014right side is ours.  \n3. **AGGRESSION**: With growth, we can afford to chase. If enemy comes down (e.g., via (4,7) to (5,7) to (6,7)), we can UP from (7,2)->(7,3)->(7,4)->(7,5) to intercept at (7,6) or (7,7). Force collision with length advantage.  \n4. **RISK LOW**: UP or RIGHT delay growth. DOWN capitalizes now. If we don't eat, enemy might grow first and catch up.  \n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN**: After eating (7,2), next turn: If enemy stays top, go RIGHT to (8,2) for double apple (now 10 apples!), then UP to (8,3)->(8,4) to dominate right side and block their path to x=8-9. If they chase, go UP to (7,3)->(7,4) and herd them into (9,9) corner. Force head-on at (7,7) or similar\u2014we win tie-breaker with higher score. Chat, this is the power play\u2014eat the apple, grow big, then close the trap!\n\n**SHORT PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nMove DOWN to (7,2) for apple + growth. Then: If enemy top, RIGHT to (8,2) for another apple and block right side; if they descend, UP to (7,3) and chase to cut their path at y=7. Hunt with length!\n\nDOWN",

Wait, row 9, col 4 is \"1\" (enemy head), so yes, they moved RIGHT from (3,9) to (4,9). Their body snakes down from there.

(7,3) is MY OLD BODY SEGMENT! It's part of my current body\u2014moving into my own body = self-crash. DEADLY! Eliminate! \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,1)**: Board shows (7,1) is EMPTY (no apple, no bodies listed). My body? All y=3+, no (7,1). Enemy? Head at (4,9), body x=1-4, y=7-9\u2014far away. SAFE.

Yes, (8,1) is an apple!], LEFT to (6,1) [empty]. 4 options, but (8,1) is a juicy apple. This keeps us in the bottom-right hunting ground.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,2)**: (6,2) is EMPTY (no apple, no bodies). Safe from self and enemy. Future: RIGHT to (7,2) [tail after we move? Actually, if we move to (6,2), (7,2) becomes new body start, but we can loop back eventually], UP to (6,3) [body segment\u2014can't go directly, but after one move it might be safe], DOWN to (6,1) [empty], LEFT to (5,2) [empty]. Only 2-3 solid options immediately (DOWN/LEFT), but it's central\u2014could chase enemy paths. However, (6,3) is body, so LEFT feels like squeezing into middle, risk of trapping ourselves later.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,2)**: (8,2) has an APPLE! Yes, from apples list. Is it safe? Not in my body (all y=3+ or x<8). Enemy far\u2014safe. Future options: RIGHT to (9,2) [apple at (9,2)? Yes, listed!], LEFT to (7,2) [tail after we move], UP to (8,3) [empty], DOWN to (8,1) [apple at (8,1)? Yes!]. 4 options, including CHAINING APPLES! From (8,2) -> RIGHT to (9,2) for another apple, or DOWN to (8,1) for that one. This DOMINATES the right side (x=8-9), boxing enemy out of the top-right corner. Aggressive!\n\nAggression check: We're leading 9-7, length 10 vs 8. We can force collisions if paths cross\u2014enemy is at (4,9), we're at (7,2). To meet, they'd need to come down right side (e.g., via (5,7)->(6,7)->(7,7)), but we can cut them off. Eating (8,2) apple grows us to 10 apples, extending our lead. Then from there, we could chase (9,2) or block at x=9. RIGHT feels like the power move\u2014own the border, force them into our body if they try to challenge. DOWN is safe but misses the apple chain\u2014RIGHT is aggressive growth with future safety. LEFT or UP are traps (UP is into body, LEFT is cramped).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (8,2) for apple + growth. Then, if enemy stays top, go RIGHT to (9,2) for another apple, then UP to (9,3)->(9,4) to seal the top-right and block their escape. If they descend, from (9,2) go LEFT to (8,2) or UP to (9,3) and herd them toward (9,9) for head-on\u2014 we win with higher score! Chat, let's eat 'em alive! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Only 3 solid options (RIGHT, DOWN, UP). Central but not expanding aggressively.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (8,1)**: (8,1) has an APPLE! From apples list. Safe from self? My body is all y=2+, so (8,1) clear. Enemy far. Future: UP to (8,2) [tail], LEFT to (7,1) [empty], RIGHT to (9,1) [empty], DOWN to (8,0) [empty]. 4 options! Chaining apples: (8,1) now, then could go RIGHT to (9,2) or other paths. This keeps us mobile in the bottom-right, boxing enemy out.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (7,2)**: (7,2) is MY CURRENT TAIL after moving! After we move, (8,2) becomes body start, so (7,2) is occupied by body. Moving LEFT into (7,2) = self-crash. DEADLY! Eliminate! \ud83d\udc80  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (9,2)**: (9,2) has an APPLE! Safe from self? Yes, clear. Enemy far.

Less flexible than DOWN.  \n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** We're crushing it 10-7, length 11 vs 8. We need to dominate the right side! DOWN eats the apple at (8,1), extending our lead to 11-7. From there, we can chase (9,2) or (9,4) apples, or even head toward enemy territory if they descend. UP is safe but boring\u2014DOWN gives that apple chain and keeps us aggressive. RIGHT is tempting for (9,2), but DOWN has more future plays and we already own (9,2) next turn.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (8,1) for apple + growth. Then, chase (9,2) apple or pivot to (9,4) to seal top-right. If enemy moves down, we can herd them toward a head-on at (7,7) or (6,7)\u2014we win with higher score!

That gives 3 solid options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Moving DOWN keeps us near the bottom, chasing that (9,0) apple next turn if safe.  \n3. **LEFT to (7,1)**: (7,1) is EMPTY. Safe from self? My body: (8,1) head, (8,2), (7,2), etc.\u2014(7,1) clear. Enemy far. Future: RIGHT to (8,1) [tail], UP to (7,2) [body? (7,2) is part of current body, so self-crash!], DOWN to (7,0) [empty], LEFT to (6,1) [empty? (6,1) is '.'\u2014safe]. Only 3 options (RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT), but UP traps us into a self-crash next turn if we go there. Not great.  \n4. **RIGHT to (9,1)**: (9,1) is EMPTY (board shows '.' there). Safe from self? Yes. Enemy far. Future: LEFT to (8,1) [tail], UP to (9,2) [apple!], DOWN to (9,0) [apple!]. 3 solid options, but we border the edge\u2014RIGHT is off-board, so limited to 3 directions. Good for apple chaining: (9,2) and (9,0) are both reachable.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** We're crushing it 11-7. We need to keep growing and dominate the right side to cut off enemy paths to apples like (8,4) or (9,6). DOWN is safe and gives us flexibility to grab (9,0) apple next, extending our lead. LEFT is okay but riskier for self-crash. RIGHT is tempting for the apple cluster at (9,0)/(9,2), but DOWN feels more central to our long-term trap plan.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move DOWN to (8,0) for safety and to chase the (9,0) apple next turn. Then pivot to (9,0) or (9,2) to grow further. If enemy drops down from top, we can herd them toward (7,7) area for a head-on\u2014we win with higher score!

They\u2019re far below \u2014 no immediate head-on threat to us this turn.\n- We\u2019re down on apples (7 vs 11).

Moving DOWN actively pursues an apple at (6,7) next turn, increasing our ability to contest mid-board and threaten to cut off their approach later.\n\nDecision logic:\n- Eliminate lethal moves (UP, LEFT).\n- Between RIGHT and DOWN: DOWN gives a clear, reachable apple next turn and increases our score while keeping multiple follow-up options (left/right/back up later). It\u2019s not a reckless commit\u2014opponent is nowhere near to force a head-on this turn.\n- We avoid any head-on gambit since we\u2019re behind on apples. Instead we prioritize safe growth to regain leverage.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 28: move DOWN to (6,8).\n- Turn 29: take apple at (6,7) (if still there) to go to 8 apples, then pivot: either press east to slice off their vertical approach or loop back up to reclaim top control depending on their movement.\n- Stay aware: if they suddenly push up the board, refuse head-on and use our body + newly-grown length to box them toward the edges.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THAT APPLE AND TURN THE TABLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is stuck top-left; we're boxing them in by claiming the right side. If they drop down, we crash them with our length. We win by growing aggressively\u2014no mercy!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move UP to (9,1) now, then next turn UP to (9,2) for the apple (if free), then LEFT to (8,2) or DOWN to (9,1) to pivot middle. Force enemy into the central trap between (3,6) and (6,4) apples\u2014herd them to (7,7) where we can chase. We're leading 13-8, length 14; if they try head-on, we crush 'em!

Instant suicide. No way. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT -> (5,7) = legal. Gets us in position to snag the apple at (5,6) next turn, with decent escape routes (up, down, left).\n- RIGHT -> (7,7) = legal. Keeps flank open, good lateral control, but doesn\u2019t approach nearby apples as efficiently.\n- DOWN -> (6,6) = legal. From here we have 3 solid follow-ups (LEFT to the apple at 5,6, RIGHT to 7,6, or DOWN to 6,5) and we stay centrally positioned to pivot toward the opponent later.\n\nEnemy check: Opponent head at (9,0) \u2014 they basically must go UP this turn and are far away. No immediate head-on threat. They\u2019ve got 12 apples vs our 8, so we should NOT force a head-to-head yet. We need to grow and close the gap first.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Keeps maximum safe options next turn (3-way mobility) and lets us pivot to grab nearby apples quickly (we can nab (5,6) on the next move).\n- Stays central so we can start angling south-east later to pressure the opponent\u2019s corridor without walking into a risky head-on while we\u2019re smaller.\n- Avoids moving into tight space near our own top-body that could get us boxed.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take the nearby apple (via DOWN then LEFT or DOWN->LEFT sequence) to start closing the score gap.\n- Keep routing so we maintain >=2 escape options each turn; don\u2019t chase a head-on until we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- Once we\u2019re closer in apples and length, start pushing east/south to threaten the opponent\u2019s vertical approach and try to shepherd them into their own body or off the board.\n\nLET\u2019S GROW, CONTROL THE CENTER, THEN FORCE THE CLASH WHEN WE\u2019RE AHEAD \u2014 CHAT HYPE ON! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Grow to length 15, extend lead to 13-8 (if score updates). Perfect aggression\u2014claim the right edge apple, chase enemy if they drop down. No trap.\n2. **DOWN to (9,0)**: (9,0) is our CURRENT BODY (old tail from last turn). Hitting own body = DEAD! \ud83d\udc80 Instant death.

Future: RIGHT to (9,1) [empty], UP to (8,2) [empty? '.'\u2014safe], DOWN to (8,0) [our body, so trap?]. Options okay, but we're moving LEFT away from apple at (9,2). Less aggressive\u2014enemy might escape the right side boxing.\n4. **RIGHT to (10,1)**: Off the board (x=10, max 9). INSTANT DEATH. \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** UP is the clear winner\u2014safe, grows us, keeps us on the offensive.

If they panic and head-down, we crash 'em with our length. Score 12-8, we lead\u2014time to gap it! Chat, we're farming this apple and owning the board!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move UP to (9,2) now, eat that apple, grow to length 15. Next turn, if enemy stays top, go LEFT to (8,2) to close in, or DOWN to (9,1) to pivot. Herd them toward (7,7) or (5,9) trap.

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 32/150, we're at (9,2) after last move UP. Score 13-9, we're leading but not safe yet. Enemy at (5,6) moving somewhere. We're locked on the right edge\u2014gotta keep pressure on them. Board is messy with apples everywhere, but we're ignoring that. Focus: box them in, force a crash or trap them in a dead-end. We're at length 14, they're at 10. Let's analyze moves from (9,2):\n\n1. **UP to (9,3)**: Empty ('.' on board). Safe from self? Body starts at (9,1) -> (9,0) -> (8,0)... (9,3) clear. Enemy not close. Future options: DOWN to (9,2) [empty], LEFT to (8,3) [empty? Board shows (8,2) is 'T' (tail?), wait board row 2: \"A . . . . . . . T T 0\" so (8,2) is 'T' - that's the tail of our body? Actually our head is at (9,2), body starts at (9,1), so (8,2) is part of our body? Wait body list: [(9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)...] Yes (8,2) is in our body, so LEFT to (8,2) would be moving into own body! That's death. RIGHT off board. UP to (9,4) is apple! But if we go UP now, next turn we might eat it. But we need to see if enemy is heading this way. Enemy head (5,6), they could go RIGHT to (6,6) but that's their body? Wait body: (6,6) is part of their body (second element). So (6,6) is occupied by their body, so they can't go there without dying unless they grow into it? Actually if they move into their own body, they die. So they likely won't go there. They might go UP to (5,7) or DOWN to (5,5). We can chase later. UP to (9,3) keeps us on edge, gives us future options DOWN (safe), maybe LEFT later if we clear body? But LEFT is death now. Actually LEFT to (8,2) is our own body, so illegal. So UP gives us only DOWN or UP next turn? RIGHT is off board. So limited options. Might trap us.\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,1)**: That's our current body (from last turn head). Hitting own body = DEATH. \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate!\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,2)**: (8,2) is part of our own body! (Body list includes (8,2)). So moving LEFT into own body = DEATH. \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,2)**: Off the board (x=10). INSTANT DEATH. \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate!\n\nWait, is that all moves? UP is the only safe move? Let's double-check board state. Row 2: \"A . . . . . . . T T 0\" at y=2, x from 0 to 9: x=0 'A', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 '.', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 '.', x=7 '.', x=8 'T', x=9 '0' (our head). So (8,2) is 'T' which is our tail? Actually tail is at (1,3) but body extends. Our body includes (8,2) indeed. So LEFT into own body. So only UP is safe. But wait, what about moving to (9,1)? That's our body from previous turn, but after moving, the tail moves forward? Actually simultaneous move: we move head, then body shifts. If we move DOWN to (9,1), which is currently occupied by our own body (the cell behind head), that's moving backwards into ourselves. That's illegal and death. So yes, only UP is safe.\n\nBut hold on: after we move, the body shifts. The cell (9,1) will become part of body but the head leaves (9,2). So if we move UP to (9,3), the new body will be (9,2), (9,1), (9,0)... So (9,1) becomes body segment. That's fine.\n\nSo only UP is safe? That seems suspicious. Let's verify all cells around:\n\nCurrent head (9,2). Adjacent:\n- UP (9,3): empty '.' (row 3: \" . . . T T T T . . .\" wait row 3 is y=3? Actually board: row 9 is top, row 0 bottom. Row 3 (y=3) shows \" . T T T T T T T . . .\" Actually let's read board properly:\n\nBoard state given:\n\n 9 . . . T T T T . . .\n 8 A . T T . A T . . .\n 7 . . . . . . T . . .\n 6 A . A A . 1 T . . A\n 5 . . . A . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . A . A A\n 3 . T T T T T T T . .\n 2 A . . . . . . T T 0\n 1 . . . . . . . . T T\n 0 . A . A . . . A T T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo y=9 (top row), y=0 (bottom). So y=2 is row 2: \"A . . . . . . . T T 0\" -> x=9 is '0' (head). y=3 is row 3: \" . T T T T T T T . . .\" Actually wait row 3 starts with a dot? The board shows \"3 . T T T T T T T . . .\" That means at y=3, x=0 is '.', x=1 'T', x=2 'T', x=3 'T', x=4 'T', x=5 'T', x=6 'T', x=7 'T', x=8 '.', x=9 '.'? But our head is at (9,2), so (9,3) is y=3, x=9, which according to row 3 is '.' (since x=9 is last dot). So (9,3) is empty.\n\nBut is (9,3) safe from enemy? Enemy head at (5,6). They could move UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6). (6,6) is their body? Actually their body: [(6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8)]. So (6,6) is the second segment (body). If they move RIGHT into (6,6), that's moving into their own body (since head moves there, body follows). That would be death unless they grow into it? Actually they would die because their head would move into their own body cell. So they likely won't do that. They might go UP to (5,7) which is empty? Row 7: \" . . . . . . T . . .\" at y=7, x=5 is '.'? Actually y=7 row: \"7 . . . . . . T . . .\" so x=5 is '.' (since x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 '.', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 'T', x=7 '.', x=8 '.', x=9 '.'). So (5,7) is empty. So they could go UP.\n\nBut we're far away. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nNow, are there other safe moves? What about DOWN to (9,1)? That's our body, death. LEFT to (8,2) is our body, death. RIGHT off board death. So only UP is safe. That seems forced. But we must consider that maybe we can go LEFT if (8,2) is not our body? Wait our body includes (8,2). Yes. So no.\n\nThus we have no choice: UP is the only move that keeps us alive. But is there any possibility to go DOWN if we consider that after moving, the tail moves? No, because the head moves into (9,1) which is currently occupied by our own body (the segment immediately behind head). That's moving backwards into yourself, which is explicitly illegal. So death.\n\nSo we must go UP. But we need to think about next turn. After moving UP to (9,3), our body will be: new head (9,3), old head (9,2), then (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). So (9,2) becomes body, (9,1) body, etc.\n\nNow, what moves will be safe next turn from (9,3)? Adjacent cells:\n- UP to (9,4): That's an apple! Row 4: \"4 . . . A . . A . A A\" so (9,4) is 'A' (apple). So we could eat apple there.\n- DOWN to (9,2): That's now our body (old head). So moving DOWN into own body = death. So can't go DOWN.\n- LEFT to (8,3): Row 3: \" . T T T T T T T . . .\" at y=3, x=8 is '.' (since x=8 is '.'). But wait, is (8,3) occupied by our body? Our body includes (8,2) but not (8,3). So (8,3) is empty. However, is (8,3) safe from enemy? Enemy body extends to (6,9) etc., but (8,3) is far. So LEFT seems possible.\n- RIGHT to (10,3): off board, death.\n\nSo after UP, we'll have two options: UP to eat apple (9,4) or LEFT to (8,3). But note: if we go UP to (9,4), we'll grow, and then next turn we could move further UP or LEFT, etc. If we go LEFT to (8,3), we move away from edge.\n\nBut we also need to consider enemy movement. They might be heading towards us. Let's see where they can go safely. Their head at (5,6). Adjacent:\n- UP (5,7): empty (row 7: '.' at x=5)\n- DOWN (5,5): row 5: \"5 . . . A . . . . . .\" so (5,5) is '.' (since x=5 is '.'? Wait row 5: y=5, x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 'A', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 '.', x=7 '.', x=8 '.', x=9 '.'. So (5,5) is '.').\n- LEFT (4,6): row 6: \"6 A . A A . 1 T . . A\" so (4,6) is 'A' (apple). But they can move into apple? Yes, they can eat and grow.\n- RIGHT (6,6): that's their own body (second segment), so moving there would be death. So they won't go RIGHT.\n\nSo they have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. They might go LEFT to eat apple at (4,6) or UP/DOWN to reposition.\n\nWe need to plan to box them in. Our current position is right edge, we can try to move LEFT towards them, but we have limited moves due to our own body. Actually from (9,2), only UP is safe. So we're forced UP. That's fine.\n\nBut wait, is there any chance that moving UP could lead to a head-on collision this turn? They could move RIGHT to (6,6) but that's death for them, so unlikely. They could move to (9, something) but they're far. So safe.\n\nThus the only move is UP.\n\nBut let's double-check: maybe (8,2) is not actually our body? Our body list: [(9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]. Yes (8,2) is in the list. So LEFT is death.\n\nThus we must go UP. Even though it's forced, we need to provide rationale and future plan.\n\nOur score is 13-9, we're winning. We need to continue growing while trapping enemy. After moving UP to (9,3), we can consider next move: either UP to (9,4) to eat apple, or LEFT to (8,3) to start encroaching on middle. Since we want to dominate board, eating apple is good. But also need to avoid getting trapped. From (9,3), if we go UP to (9,4) and eat, we grow to length 15. Then next turn from (9,4), we could go LEFT to (8,4) (apple? row 4: (8,4) is 'A'? row 4: \"4 . . . A . . A . A A\" -> x=8 is 'A' (since x=9 is 'A', x=8 is '.'? Wait count: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 'A', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 'A', x=7 '.', x=8 'A', x=9 'A'? Actually the string: \". . . A . . A . A A\" - that's 10 characters? Let's count: 0:'.', 1:'.', 2:'.', 3:'A', 4:'.', 5:'.', 6:'A', 7:'.', 8:'A', 9:'A'. So (8,4) is 'A', (9,4) is 'A'. So both apples. So eating at (9,4) gives apple. Then we could go LEFT to (8,4) which is also apple, but that would be moving into apple that might be contested? But enemy far.\n\nAlternatively, if we go LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3), that's empty, then we can move further LEFT to (7,3) but (7,3) is part of our body? Actually (7,3) is in our body list. So can't go there. So maybe we need to spiral inward.\n\nBetter to eat apples on the right edge to grow and maintain lead. Since we're forced UP, we'll eat apple at (9,4) next turn if we choose to go UP again. But wait, from (9,3), moving UP to (9,4) is safe? Check: (9,4) is apple, not occupied by any snake body? Enemy body far. Our body doesn't include (9,4). So safe. Then after eating, we grow, and tail moves forward. That's good.\n\nBut also, we need to be careful about future trapping. Our body is along x=9 and x=8, y from 0 to 2, and then snaking leftwards along y=3. So we're kind of blocking the right side. The enemy is in top-left. We could try to move LEFT across y=3 to cut off the top of the board. However, our own body blocks some paths. We need to plan a path that doesn't trap us.\n\nLet's think long-term: We want to force enemy into a corner. The enemy's current body occupies column 6 from y=6 to y=9, then goes left to x=5,4,3,2,8? Actually list: (6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9),(3,9),(3,8),(2,8). So they're occupying the top-right of left side (x=2-6, y=6-9). They have apples around: (6,4) is apple, (5,6) apple? Actually (5,6) is enemy head, but there's an apple at (5,6)? The apple list includes (5,8), (6,4), etc. Not sure if (5,6) is apple. The board shows '1' at (5,6) representing enemy head, not apple. So they might move to eat nearby apples.\n\nWe should try to move LEFT towards them to cut off their escape. But we must avoid collisions. Our head at (9,2) only can go UP. So we go UP.\n\nNow, after moving UP to (9,3), we'll have head at (9,3). At that point, we should consider moving LEFT to (8,3) next turn to start moving inward. But (8,3) is empty and safe. However, we need to ensure that moving LEFT doesn't put us in a position where we have no safe moves later. From (8,3), adjacent cells: UP (8,4) is apple, DOWN (8,2) is our body (since (8,2) is in body), LEFT (7,3) is our body (since (7,3) is in body), RIGHT (9,3) would be empty after we move? Actually if we move LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3), then (9,3) becomes part of body. So from (8,3), the only safe move might be UP to (8,4) (apple) or maybe DOWN? But (8,2) is our body, so DOWN is death. LEFT is death. RIGHT is back to (9,3) which is now body? Actually after moving, the body shifts: new head (8,3), old head (9,3) becomes body. So (9,3) will be body, so RIGHT into (9,3) would be moving into own body? Actually if we move RIGHT from (8,3), we go to (9,3), which is the old head position, now part of body. That's moving into our own body, death. So from (8,3), only UP to (8,4) is safe. So that's a dead end: we can only go UP. That's dangerous because we might get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, from (9,3) we could go UP to (9,4) to eat apple. Then from (9,4), adjacent: UP (9,5) is empty? row 5: \"5 . . . A . . . . . .\" so (9,5) is '.' (x=9). DOWN (9,3) will be body (old head). LEFT (8,4) is apple. RIGHT off board. So we could go LEFT to (8,4) (apple) or UP to (9,5) (empty). That gives more options. So maybe going UP to (9,4) is better because it keeps options open.\n\nBut wait, from (9,3), moving UP to (9,4) is safe and we can eat apple. That grows us. Then from (9,4), we have two options: LEFT to (8,4) (apple) or UP to (9,5) (empty). That's better than being forced only UP from (8,3).\n\nThus our long-term plan: Move UP now to (9,3). Next turn, move UP to (9,4) to eat apple and grow. Then we can decide: if enemy is still far, we can move LEFT to (8,4) to start cutting across. That will put us at (8,4), and from there we can move UP to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,4) (check if (7,4) is empty? row 4: (7,4) is '.'? row 4: x=7 is '.' (since x=6 'A', x=7 '.', x=8 'A', x=9 'A'). So (7,4) empty. So we have more options.\n\nAlso, we need to monitor enemy movement. They might go LEFT to eat apple at (4,6) or UP/DOWN. If they go UP to (5,7), they might head towards top-right corner. We could chase them later.\n\nGiven the forced move, we have to go UP. Let's produce the response with rationale and plan.\n\nWe must use emojis and rhetorical questions. Also, the final line must be exactly \"UP\" (or the chosen move).\n\nWe'll write:\n\nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 32, forced move here\u2014only UP keeps us alive! Our head at (9,2) is trapped: LEFT and DOWN are our own body, RIGHT off board. So we gotta go UP to (9,3). That's safe, enemy far away. We're leading 13-9, time to extend that gap! After this move, we'll be at (9,3) with body shifting. Next turn, plan is to go UP again to (9,4) and eat that apple\u2014grow to length 15 and keep dominating the right edge. Then we can start moving LEFT to cut off the enemy's escape routes. They're stuck in the top-left; we'll box them in and force a crash with our superior length. Let's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\nNow, the final line: UP.\n\nBut we need to ensure the last line is exactly one word. So we'll put \"UP\" on its own line.\n\nLet's craft the response.YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 32, we're at (9,2) after last move UP. Score 13-9\u2014we're dominating but not safe yet! Let's break it down:\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **DOWN to (9,1)**: That's our own body (from last turn). Moving backwards = DEAD. \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT to (8,2)**: Also our own body (part of the snake). Instant death. \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT to (10,2)**: Off the board. Game over. \ud83d\udc80\n\nOnly **UP to (9,3)** is safe! (9,3) is empty ('.' on board), no enemy there (they're at (5,6) far away), and no self-collision. This keeps us alive and on the offensive.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** We're forced to go UP, but that's actually perfect\u2014we're staying on the right edge, maintaining board control. Enemy is stuck in the top-left; we need to keep pressuring them. After moving UP, our head will be at (9,3). From there, we have a clear path to the apple at (9,4) next turn, which will grow us to length 15 and extend our lead to 14-9 (or more if they don't eat). We can then pivot LEFT to (8,4) to start cutting across the board, trapping them in the corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move UP now. Next turn, eat the apple at (9,4) if safe, then move LEFT to (8,4) to begin boxing them in. Watch their head\u2014if they head toward us, we'll force a head-on collision with our higher score (13 vs 9). No mercy, we're winning this! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

We're ahead, but we need to stay alive and pressure them. Let's break it down!\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT (10,4)**: Off the board. DEAD. \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (9,3)**: That's our own body! Looking at the board state, (9,3) is 'T' (our tail). That's a crash. DEAD. \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT (8,4)**: Check the board: at (8,4) there's an 'A' (apple). That's safe! No snake body there. However, we must also check if the enemy might move into (8,4) simultaneously. Enemy is at (3,6), far away. They can't reach (8,4) in one move. So LEFT is safe from immediate collision. But wait\u2014let's check our own body: (8,4) is not in our body list. Our body is all in column 9 and 8, but let's verify: Our body: (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). (8,4) is NOT in this list. So LEFT is safe.\n- **UP (9,5)**: Check board: (9,5) is '.' (empty). Is it in our body? No. Is enemy there? No. So UP is also safe.\n\nSo we have two safe moves: LEFT and UP.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWe have a choice! LEFT to (8,4) grabs an apple (+1 point) and moves us off the right edge, giving us more central control. UP to (9,5) keeps us on the edge but doesn't give an apple immediately. However, note: if we go LEFT to (8,4) and eat the apple, we grow. That means our tail won't move this turn. That could be a problem if we need space later. But we have plenty of space.\n\nLooking at the enemy: They're at (3,6) with body stretching up to (3,9) and right to (6,9). They're trapped in the top-left corner. If we go LEFT to (8,4), we can start moving across the board to cut them off. From (8,4), next turn we could go LEFT to (7,4) or DOWN to (8,3) etc. We need to think about trapping them.\n\nBut wait: There's an apple at (9,6). If we go UP to (9,5), next turn we could go UP to (9,6) and eat that apple. That would grow us again. However, going UP now puts us closer to the enemy's potential path? Enemy is at (3,6). They might be going for apples at (9,6) or (8,4)? Unlikely. They're far.\n\nActually, we should consider the long-term plan: We need to box them in. They're in the top-left. If we move LEFT to (8,4), we can start moving left across the board to block their escape routes. From (8,4), we can go LEFT to (7,4), then LEFT to (6,4), etc. That would create a horizontal barrier at y=4. Meanwhile, their body is at y=6,7,8,9. If we block y=4, they might be forced to go down or up, but they have limited space.\n\nBut note: There are apples at (6,4) and (3,4) etc. We could eat those as we move left. That would grow us and increase our lead.\n\nAlternatively, going UP to (9,5) keeps us on the edge, but then we might miss the apple at (8,4). Let's check the board: (8,4) is an apple. We should eat it if safe. It is safe. Eating apples is good because it grows us and increases our score lead. The more we grow, the more board control we have.\n\nBut caution: If we eat an apple, our tail stays. That means we leave a trail that might block us later. However, our current tail is at (2,3). If we go LEFT to (8,4), we grow, so tail stays at (2,3). That's fine.\n\nAlso, we need to think about enemy's possible moves. They might move toward us or away. If we go LEFT to (8,4), we are moving toward the center. They might try to head-on collision if they think they can win? But we have more apples (14 vs 10), so if they move into us, they die. So head-on is good for us.\n\nWhat about moving UP? (9,5) is empty. From there, we could go LEFT to (8,5) or UP to (9,6) to eat another apple. That would give us two apples quickly. But (9,6) is also an apple. However, note: There's an apple at (9,6) and (8,4). Which is safer? Let's see if any snake body is near (9,6). Enemy body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) are part of their body. (6,6) is occupied. (9,6) is far from them. So (9,6) is safe for now.\n\nBut if we go UP to (9,5), we might be moving into a position where enemy could potentially cut us off? Unlikely.\n\nI think the best move is LEFT to (8,4) because:\n1. It grabs an apple immediately (+1 point, lead becomes 15-10).\n2. It moves us off the right edge, giving us more mobility.\n3. It starts our journey leftward to block the enemy.\n4. It's safe: no self-collision, no enemy collision, not off board.\n\nIf we go UP, we don't get an apple now, and we might miss the opportunity to eat (8,4) later if something changes. But (8,4) is an apple now; it might disappear if we don't eat it? Actually, apples are static until eaten. So we could eat it next turn from (9,5) by going LEFT? From (9,5) to (8,5) not (8,4). To eat (8,4) from (9,5), we'd need to go DOWN to (9,4) then LEFT? That's two moves. So eating (8,4) from (9,5) is not direct. From (9,4) to (8,4) is direct. So if we don't eat it now, we might have to go out of our way later.\n\nThus, LEFT is better for immediate growth.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move LEFT to (8,4), eat apple, grow. Next turn, from (8,4), we can go LEFT to (7,4) (empty, check board: (7,4) is '.'), or DOWN to (8,3) (empty? board shows (8,3) is '.'? Actually board row 3: \". . T T T T T T . T\" so (8,3) is 'T' (our own tail). That would be backwards into our own body? Wait, (8,3) is part of our body? Let's see: Our body includes (8,2), (8,1), (8,0). (8,3) is not listed. Actually (8,3) is not in our body list. But board shows at (8,3) is 'T'? Let's check board again: Row 3: \" . . T T T T T T . T \" for columns 0-9. So (0,3)='.', (1,3)='.', (2,3)='T', (3,3)='T', (4,3)='T', (5,3)='T', (6,3)='T', (7,3)='T', (8,3)='.', (9,3)='T'. Wait, the board string: \" . . T T T T T T . T \" means: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 'T', col3 'T', col4 'T', col5 'T', col6 'T', col7 'T', col8 '.', col9 'T'. So (8,3) is '.' not 'T'. So DOWN to (8,3) is safe. But (8,3) is empty. However, moving DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3) would put us right above our own tail? Actually our tail is at (2,3). So it's fine.\n\nBut we need to plan: After eating apple at (8,4), our head will be at (8,4), tail remains at (2,3). Next turn, we want to continue left to block enemy. From (8,4), LEFT to (7,4) is safe (board shows (7,4) is '.'? Row 4: \" . . . A . . A . A 0 \" so (7,4) is '.'? Actually row 4: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 'A', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 'A', col7 '.', col8 'A', col9 '0'. So (7,4) is '.' indeed. So LEFT is good.\n\nThus, moving LEFT now sets us up for a series of LEFT moves along y=4, eating apples at (6,4) and (3,4) as we go. That will grow us further and keep us ahead.\n\nAlso, we should monitor enemy. If they move toward us, we might force a head-on collision. Since we have more apples, we win if both die.\n\nSo decision: LEFT.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Their body sits mostly on y=3 and right edge \u2014 no simultaneous head clash threat if we go DOWN/LEFT/UP.\n- None of LEFT/UP/DOWN move into our own body. All safe moves except RIGHT.\n\nTactical pick:\n- We\u2019re down on apples (10 vs 14). We must be aggressive and chain apples to close the gap.\n- DOWN -> (3,5) gives the best immediate apple chaining (then (3,4) and/or (4,5)), and keeps multiple escape/follow-up options (left, right, down, or back up later).\n- LEFT -> (2,6) gets an apple but fewer immediate follow-ups and is more sideways; UP is too passive.\n\nShort strategy note for next turns:\n- Chain (3,5) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (4,5) to eat fast and grow. After securing apples, use increased length to start hemming the right side, but avoid forcing a head-on until our apple lead is better or opponent gets boxed into a head clash. Never go into tight dead-ends near opponent body at y=3.\n\nFinal move:\nDOWN",

It's now part of our body (since we grew). CRASH! DEAD. \ud83d\udc80\n- **UP (8,5)**: Check board: (8,5) is '.' (empty). Not in our body (our body is mostly left of us now). Not in enemy body.

DOWN to (8,3) is empty but moves us away from the enemy. Both would waste time and let the enemy potentially break out. We need to be aggressive and control the board!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep moving LEFT along y=4. Next turn, go LEFT to (6,4) to eat that apple. Then continue LEFT to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) (another apple!), and so on. This creates a horizontal wall that traps the enemy in the top-left while we grow bigger and stronger.

We're still ahead, but we need to keep pressing the attack and box them in! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **RIGHT (8,4)**: That's our old body position! It's still part of our body (we grew, so our tail is at (2,3) but the path includes (8,4)). CRASH! DEAD. \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT (6,4)**: Board shows (6,4) is 'A' (an apple!). Not in our body (our tail is at (2,3)). Not in enemy body (enemy is at (3,4) with body at (3,5)-(6,9) - wait, (6,4) is empty on the board, actually (6,4) shows as 'A', but the apple list says (6,4) is an apple. The board shows (6,4) as 'A' in the string. So it's an apple. Moving there is SAFE and would GROW us! That's huge! \n- **UP (7,5)**: Board shows (7,5) is '.' (empty). Not in our body. Not in enemy body (enemy head is at (3,4), body doesn't reach (7,5)). SAFE!\n- **DOWN (7,3)**: Board shows (7,3) is 'T' - that's our own tail! Our body goes from (8,4) -> (9,4) -> ... -> (2,3). So (7,3) is indeed part of our tail. Moving DOWN would crash into ourselves! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo we have two safe moves: LEFT to (6,4) (an apple!) or UP to (7,5).\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWe NEED to go LEFT to (6,4)! That's an apple - eating it extends our lead to 16 apples vs their 12. That's content AND strategy! Plus, it keeps us moving along y=4, continuing our horizontal wall formation to trap the enemy. \n\nWhat about UP to (7,5)? It's safe but doesn't help our plan. We'd be moving away from the enemy and wasting an opportunity to grow. The enemy is at (3,4) - we want to close that gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat the apple at (6,4), then continue moving LEFT to (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) (another apple!), creating a solid horizontal barrier. This traps the enemy in the top-left quadrant while we grow to 16 apples. If they try to break through, we'll have the size advantage for a head-on collision!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Illegal. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (3,3) is occupied by opponent body (they\u2019re stacked at (3,3)). Moving there = instant death. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (4,4) is legal.\n- LEFT -> (2,4) is legal and has an apple.\n\nTactical read on the opponent (Head at 7,4):\n- Their legal moves this turn are LEFT -> (6,4) (apple) or UP -> (7,5). They cannot move DOWN/RIGHT (those are into their own body/neck).\n- We are behind on apples (12 vs 15). We should NOT bait a head-on \u2014 they have the lead. Avoid simultaneous collisions.\n\nMove comparison:\n- RIGHT to (4,4): safe, but edges us toward the rival along y=4 and gives only about 2 follow-up options (UP to an apple at 4,5 or RIGHT to open space). Risk: it brings us closer to their approach vector.\n- LEFT to (2,4): grabs an apple immediately, is farther from the enemy, and from (2,4) we have more escape/flex options next turn (UP, LEFT, or DOWN available \u2014 three non-backwards choices). Keeps our mobility open and continues the apple chase to close the gap.\n\nDecision: Take the apple, keep maximum follow-ups, avoid head-on. We go LEFT and force them to come to us if they want to contest \u2014 don\u2019t give them the easy double-KO.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- 1) LEFT to (2,4) now (eat apple \u2192 close gap).\n- 2) Keep movement flexible: prefer routes that preserve 2\u20133 safe exits (avoid funneling into our own body at the top/left). If the opponent pushes toward us from (6,4), use lateral movement and body as walls to box them rather than charging head-first.\n- 3) Only commit to a head-on when our apples >= theirs or we can guarantee they crash first. For now: eat, reposition, control space.\n\nLEFT",

Let's keep the pressure ON! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **UP (6,5)**: Board shows (6,5) is '.' (empty). Not in our body. Not in enemy body (enemy body doesn't reach (6,5) - their body ends at (3,8) going up to (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9)). SAFE!\n- **DOWN (6,3)**: Board shows (6,3) is 'T' - that's our own tail! Our body goes from (7,4) -> (8,4) -> ... -> (2,3). So (6,3) is part of our tail. Moving DOWN would crash into ourselves! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT (5,4)**: Board shows (5,4) is '.' (empty). Not in our body. Not in enemy body (enemy head is at (2,4), body at (3,4)-(3,8)). SAFE!\n- **RIGHT (7,4)**: Board shows (7,4) is 'T' - that's our old body position! Our body includes (7,4) as the first segment after our head at (6,4). Moving RIGHT would crash into ourselves! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo we have two safe moves: UP to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,4).\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWe NEED to go LEFT to (5,4)! Why? Because we're building our horizontal wall to trap the enemy in the top-left corner. Our plan was to go (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) to create a solid barrier. The enemy is at (2,4) with their body stretching upward - if we push left to (5,4) and then (4,4), we'll be boxing them in! \n\nUP to (6,5) is safe but moves us AWAY from the enemy and breaks our plan. We want to dominate the board and keep them contained! Plus, moving left keeps us on the path to possibly cut them off completely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue moving LEFT to (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4) to create that impenetrable wall. The enemy is trapped in the top-left with limited escape routes. Once we have them boxed in, we can force a head-on collision with our size advantage (16 vs 13) and secure the win!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Neck is (3,4) so RIGHT is directly backwards \u2014 illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n\nQuick legal sweep:\n- RIGHT -> (3,4): illegal (backwards into our neck). \u274c\n- UP -> (2,5): empty. Good path toward the apple at (2,6) next turn, but note (3,5) (to the right of that cell) is our body so from (2,5) RIGHT is death; UP gives at most 2 safe exits (UP to apple or LEFT).\n- DOWN -> (2,3): empty. From there RIGHT -> (3,3) is occupied by the enemy body (instant death), so DOWN also has only ~2 safe follow-ups (LEFT or DOWN).\n- LEFT -> (1,4): empty. From here we have LEFT, UP, DOWN available (three non-backwards exits) \u2014 maximum immediate mobility and better ability to box/avoid traps.\n\nEnemy read (head at 6,4; neck at 7,4):\n- Their only legal moves are LEFT -> (5,4) or UP -> (6,5). They can\u2019t go RIGHT (neck) or DOWN (their body at 6,3). So they\u2019ll push left/up \u2014 predictable.\n- We are behind on apples (13 vs 16). Don\u2019t force a simultaneous head-on \u2014 we\u2019d lose the risk. Instead, preserve space and force them into risky approaches.\n\nTactical choice: LEFT to (1,4).\n- Why: keeps the most escape routes (3 exits), avoids any immediate head-on risk, and positions us to slowly corral the opponent without committing to a collision while we\u2019re down on apples. It also denies them easy straight-line approach to our head and gives us room to bait them into hitting our body.\n- UP would chase an apple in two moves but traps us against our own body on the right; DOWN exposes a dead-right into enemy body. LEFT is the flex play \u2014 aggressive positioning without gambling the game.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) Move LEFT now to secure mobility.\n2) From (1,4) watch opponent\u2019s choice: if they push left aggressively, use lateral movement + our body to create a wall and force them toward our occupied cells (they\u2019d die if they run into us). If they go up, rotate to take open apples while keeping at least 2 escape routes.\n3) Only commit to head-on when we either tie or lead apples or can guarantee they run into our body first. For now: box, bait, and pick apples that keep our options open.\n\nWe go LEFT. LET\u2019S FINISH THIS. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Neck is (2,4) so:\n- RIGHT -> (2,4): illegal (backwards into our neck). Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (0,4): legal but hugs the left wall \u2014 from (0,4) you only have UP and DOWN next turn (2 exits). Risk of getting squeezed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP -> (1,5): legal. From there you have UP (1,6), LEFT (0,5), and RIGHT (2,5 \u2014 apple). High mobility (3 exits) + immediate access to the apple corridor at (2,5)/(2,6). \u2705\n- DOWN -> (1,3): legal. Also gives ~3 exits (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN), safe, but doesn\u2019t put us on the apple chain as quickly as UP. \u2705\n\nOpponent read (head at 5,4, neck at 6,4): they cannot move RIGHT or DOWN (their own body), so their options are LEFT -> (4,4) or UP -> (5,5). They can\u2019t reach our head this turn. We\u2019re behind on apples (13 vs 16) \u2014 DO NOT force a head-on. Bait, box slowly, and grab apples to close the gap.\n\nDecision logic:\n- Avoid LEFT (edge reduces escapes).\n- Both UP and DOWN are safe, but UP wins because it immediately threatens the apple at (2,5) and sets up a quick follow-up to (2,6) while keeping three escape routes. That lets us grow while retaining mobility to bait the enemy and avoid risky head-on collisions.\n- Plan to avoid simultaneous-head moves unless we\u2019re ahead or guaranteed win. We\u2019ll use the apple chain to close the score and then look to corral the opponent once we have more apples or a positional trap.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be the last-rationale for the next turn):\n1) Move UP to (1,5).\n2) If safe, push RIGHT to eat (2,5) then consider (2,6) or fall back to (1,6) to keep options open.\n3) Monitor opponent: if they push left toward the center, use our growing body as a wall and rotate to cut off their escape; only force head-on when we have the apple advantage or can guarantee they hit our body.\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT \u2014 play smart, grow fast, and box \u2019em later.

Enemy head at (1,5) is far left. However, enemy's body stretches to (4,6) and (3,5) etc. We're not colliding immediately. But moving UP might open us to a trap\u2014enemy could move to cut us off. Still, we need apples to dominate.\n- **DOWN (4,3):** Moves us down to empty space. This keeps our body growing toward the bottom. But no apple gain. However, we're building a wall to box enemy in the top-left. Moving DOWN might delay that, but it's safer long-term? Let's think: Our current body spans from (9,4) rightward to (5,4) and down to (9,0) etc. We have a long body. Moving DOWN to (4,3) gives us more room to maneuver and avoids the apple at (4,5) which is surrounded by enemy body nearby. Also, if we go UP to (4,5), the apple disappears, but then our next move options might be limited. DOWN keeps options open: from (4,3) we can go DOWN to (4,2) (empty), LEFT to (3,3) (empty), RIGHT to (5,3) (but that's our body? Actually (5,3) is our tail, so if we don't grow, it might move away, but careful). UP back to (4,4) (our previous spot).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have a size advantage (16 vs 13). Instead of chasing apples, we should focus on enclosing enemy. Enemy is trapped in top-left corner with their body blocking paths. By moving DOWN to (4,3), we maintain our position to advance left toward (3,3) next, cutting off enemy escape routes. We'll force them to crash into us or into walls. Tomorrow (turn 40), from (4,3) we can move LEFT to (3,3) to start sealing the left side. Enemy will be forced to move into our path or into corner. With our lead, we can afford to grow slowly while trapping. Let's go for the strategic position over the apple\u2014control the board, not just points!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Neck: (1,4) \u2192 so DOWN is illegal (backwards). Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Apples right next to us: (2,5) and (2,6).

LEFT\u2192(3,4) would smash into our body and kill them \u2014 they won\u2019t pick suicide unless forced.\n\nLegal moves and quick eval\n- UP \u2192 (1,6): safe, good mobility (3 exits). Keeps options open but delays an immediate apple.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5): legal but hugs wall and limits escapes. Risky long-term. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5): legal and contains an apple. Eating it immediately narrows our next-step options (we\u2019ll be forced UP to (2,6) next turn because right/down/right are blocked by our body/neck), but that\u2019s actually a GOOD apple chain: (2,5) \u2192 (2,6) nets two apples in two moves and closes the apple gap fast. Aggressive and practical.\n- DOWN \u2192 illegal (back into neck).\n\nRisk check\n- Opponent cannot reach (2,5) this turn, so taking it is safe from head-on this turn.\n- We are behind on apples (13 vs 16). Grabbing apples quickly is priority over teasing a head-on. We should avoid forcing collisions while trailing.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be our next-turn rationale)\n1) RIGHT to (2,5) and EAT. \ud83c\udf4e\n2) Next turn: go UP to (2,6) and EAT again \u2014 the apple chain is set. After that, evaluate whether to peel out to (2,7) and widen escape routes or rotate to cut the opponent if they push toward us.\n3) Continue to avoid risky head-on until we close the apple gap. Use our growing body as a wall to box when we\u2019re at parity or ahead.\n\nWe\u2019re hunting apples and building the squeeze. Let\u2019s close the gap fast and then we start corralling. Ready?

Moving directly BACKWARDS into our own body (into the cell behind our head) is illegal! Our head was at (4,4) last turn, and we moved DOWN to (4,3). So (4,4) is now part of our body (the segment behind the head). Moving UP would be moving backwards into our own body - DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (4,2):** Board shows (4,2) is '.' (empty). Not in our body (our tail is at (4,3) now? Wait no, our tail moves too - we need to check our full body. Our body currently: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), etc. (4,2) should be empty. Not in enemy body (enemy body is mostly in rows 4-9, left side). SAFE!\n- **LEFT (3,3):** Board shows (3,3) is '.' (empty). Not in our body. Not in enemy body (enemy body is at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) etc, but not (3,3)). SAFE!\n- **RIGHT (5,3):** Board shows (5,3) is '.' (empty). Wait, checking our body: we have (5,4), (6,4), etc. (5,3) should be empty. Not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nThree SAFE moves! LEFT to (3,3) is interesting - it moves us toward enemy territory and could help box them in. DOWN to (4,2) keeps us safe and moves toward potential apples. RIGHT to (5,3) moves us right but keeps us parallel to enemy body above.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT (3,3):** This is the most aggressive! It moves us directly into the gap between our current position and enemy's body at (3,4). From (3,3), we can potentially cut off enemy escape routes. Enemy head at (2,5) could move DOWN to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,5) or UP to (2,6) or LEFT to (1,5). If we're at (3,3), we're not immediately threatening but we're positioning to block. This maintains our lead and continues the boxing strategy.\n- **DOWN (4,2):** Safe but passive. We'd move down toward the bottom row. There's an apple at (0,2) but that's far left. This might delay our boxing strategy.\n- **RIGHT (5,3):** Moves us right along row 3. But our body already extends right to (9,4), (9,3), etc. This might not be optimal for trapping enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have a size advantage (16 vs 14). Enemy is trapped in top-left corner. By moving LEFT to (3,3), we continue our advance toward the left side to complete the enclosure. From (3,3), next turn we could go UP to (3,4) if it's safe (might be enemy body though), or LEFT to (2,3) to get even closer to enemy head. We need to force enemy into a corner where they'll crash.

Let's check our body: head (3,3), then (4,3) should be the next segment. Moving RIGHT back to (4,3) would be moving into our own body! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (3,2):** Board shows (3,2) is '.' empty. Not in our body. Not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nTwo SAFE moves! LEFT to (2,3) is aggressively moving toward enemy territory. DOWN to (3,2) is more conservative and moves us toward the bottom.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT (2,3):** PERFECT! This moves us directly into the enemy's escape route. We're at (2,3), one step away from enemy head at (2,6). We're boxing them in! From here, we can potentially cut off their access to the left side. Enemy could try to move DOWN to (2,5) or UP to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6). But if we're positioned at (2,3), we're controlling the vertical column. This is aggressive positioning to force a head-on collision or trap them in the corner. With our size advantage (16-15), a head-on collision would make us WIN! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (3,2):** Safe but passive. Moves us away from the enemy. We'd be giving up our aggressive positioning in the top-left quadrant. The enemy has 15 apples and is getting desperate - we need to keep the pressure ON!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have the lead and want to force a confrontation. By moving LEFT to (2,3), we continue advancing toward the enemy's domain. Our next move could be UP to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,3) to get even closer. We need to cut off their escape routes and trap them against the walls. If they get desperate and move into us, we win with our higher score!

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,8) and we gotta keep boxing them in! Let's check the board state and plan our next move.\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **UP (1,4):** Board shows (1,4) is 'T' - that's our own body! We would be moving directly into our own body segment. DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT (0,3):** Board shows (0,3) is '.' empty. Not in our body (we're at (1,3)). Not in enemy body (enemy body is at rows 4-9). SAFE!\n- **RIGHT (2,3):** Board shows (2,3) is 'T' - that's our own body! We would be moving into our own body segment. DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (1,2):** Board shows (1,2) is '.' empty. Not in our body. Not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nTwo SAFE moves! LEFT to (0,3) and DOWN to (1,2). LEFT is SUPER aggressive - moving us to the absolute left wall, boxing the enemy in even tighter! DOWN is more conservative.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT (0,3):** PERFECT! This moves us to the left wall (x=0), completely cutting off the enemy's escape to the left! From (0,3), we're controlling the left boundary. The enemy is trapped in a tight space between x=1 and x=3, y=4 to y=9. With our size advantage (16-15), we want to force a head-on collision where we win! If they panic and move into our body, THEY die! We're forcing them toward the top-left corner where they have limited options. This is EXACTLY the boxing strategy we need! \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (1,2):** Safe but less aggressive. Moves us down toward the bottom where there's more open space, but we'd be giving up our position to trap the enemy in the top-left corner. Enemy has 15 apples and is desperate - we need to keep the pressure ON!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe have the lead and want to force a confrontation. By moving LEFT to (0,3), we're establishing a wall on the left side. Next turn, we could potentially move UP to (0,4) or (0,5) to get even closer to the enemy's territory and further compress their escape routes. We need to trap them against the walls and force them into a corner where they have no safe moves. If they get desperate and move into us, we win! Let's keep this aggressive boxing strategy going! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n\nleft",

That\u2019s huge momentum swing. \ud83c\udfaf\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups available (from y=9 we can pivot left or right next turn), avoiding being boxed on the left wall.\n- Doesn\u2019t funnel us into their corridor or into our own body \u2014 preserves mobility for the midgame trap plays.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n1) UP now to tie apples.  \n2) Reassess opponent reaction; if they drift into tighter space, start cutting exits and forcing them into collisions when we can take advantage.  \n3) If they play safe, continue picking reachable apples and maintain center control \u2014 be ready to go for a head-on only when we have the apple/score edge.\n\nLET\u2019S TIE THIS \u2014 MAKE THE MOVE:\n\nUP",

The enemy snake #1 is at (2,9) and we gotta keep boxing them in! Let's check the board state and plan our next move.\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **UP (0,4):** Board shows (0,4) is 'T' - that's our own body! We would be moving directly into our own body segment. DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT (-1,3):** Off the board! x=-1 is out of bounds. DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT (1,3):** Board shows (1,3) is 'T' - that's our own body! We would be moving into our own body segment. DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN (0,2):** Board shows (0,2) is 'A' - an apple! Not in our body. Not in enemy body. SAFE!\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nOnly ONE SAFE move! DOWN to (0,2) where there's an apple. We grow to 17 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN (0,2):** We get a free apple and grow. From (0,2), we're still on the left wall, maintaining our position to box in the enemy. The enemy is trapped at (2,9) with limited escape routes - they're forced to move DOWN to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,9), both of which are tight spaces. We're compressing their territory from below while staying safe on the boundary.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're growing and maintaining the pressure. From (0,2), next turn we can potentially move DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2) to continue our path. The enemy is getting desperate - they're cornered in the top-left with their body spread across x=2 and x=6. We need to keep them trapped against the walls and force them into a collision. If we keep growing while they're stuck, we'll eventually have the size advantage to win by force. Let's keep this boxing strategy going! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN\n\ndown",

Keeps us more central, preserves multiple follow-ups and routes to contest the middle/top apples. \u2705\n\nThreat read on Snake #0 (head 0,3; neck 1,3):\n- They only have UP to (0,4) or DOWN to (0,2) this turn. They are stuck in a low/right corridor and cannot threaten our head this turn or the next couple turns.\n- No immediate head-on risk if we go RIGHT. LEFT would slowly race toward a column they might try to climb, but we\u2019d rather control center-space than commit to an early wall-hug.\n\nWhy RIGHT is the play:\n- Keeps our mobility maxed out \u2014 two-side options and downward escape routes remain open. We avoid funneling ourselves into the left-wall trap. \ud83e\udded\n- Moves us toward the open middle/top area where we can pivot to box the opponent later or take apples safely.\n- With apples tied 16\u201316, don\u2019t force a risky head-on. Preserve life and options; pick the KO only when we have the score or clear positional advantage.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n1) RIGHT now to (3,9) to keep central control.  \n2) From there, look for openings to sweep down into the opponent\u2019s corridor entrance or pinch them along X=0 if they expose themselves \u2014 but only take head-on when we have a clear edge.  \n3) Keep tracking their head moves; if they drift farther up column 0, consider cutting their exits by occupying key junctions rather than hugging the wall.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX THIS FOOL \u2014 MAKE THE MOVE:\n\nRIGHT",

Looking at our body: our tail is at (8,1), and we have no body at (0,1). The enemy is far away at top. So DOWN to (0,1) is actually SAFE too!\n\n**Wait!** Let me double-check my body segments: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (8,1). None of these are at (0,1) or (1,2)! Both are safe!\n\n**Two SAFE moves:**\n1. RIGHT to (1,2) - empty space, safe\n2.

That's HUGE!\n\n**Long-term strategy:** From (0,1), we'll be even lower on the left wall, which helps us continue boxing in the enemy who's stuck up top. They're running out of space! From there, we can potentially move RIGHT to (1,1) or continue DOWN to (0,0) next turn.

That narrows escape options and risks cornering ourselves later if we try to swing back toward the left corridor.\n- RIGHT to (4,9): keeps us more central, preserves two-way mobility (can go RIGHT or DOWN next turn), and leaves room to pivot toward the middle of the board to pressure or cut off the opponent later.

We're leading 17-16 but we gotta STAY AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- **My Head:** (0, 1) - currently on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e (Wait, did I eat it last turn? The apple list shows (0,1) is an apple drop, but since I'm on it, I should have eaten it and grown. The board shows 'A' at (0,1), so I'm on it right now.)\n- **My Body:** The list starts from head, so: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), ...] - I'm at (0,1), so my body segment behind me is (0,2). My tail is at (8,0).\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 9) - still trapped in the top-left corner!\n- **Enemy Body:** Blocks top row and right side of their corner.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (0,1):**\n\n**LEFT:** (-1, 1) - OFF BOARD! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n**UP:** (0, 2) - That's my own body segment! DEAD! \ud83d\udc80\n**DOWN:** (0, 0) - Board shows '.' (empty). Is it safe? My body is at (0,2), (0,3), etc. No body at (0,0). Enemy is far away at (4,9). SAFE! \u2705\n**RIGHT:** (1, 1) - Board shows '.' (empty). Is it safe? My body: (0,2), (0,3)... (1,3) is part of my body but that's at y=3, not y=1. (9,1) is my body but that's far right. (1,1) should be empty! Enemy is far. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**TWO SAFE OPTIONS:** DOWN to (0,0) or RIGHT to (1,1)!\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nWe're on the left wall at (0,1). If we go DOWN to (0,0), we hit the absolute bottom-left corner - that's a DEAD END! From (0,0), next turn we'd only have RIGHT as a safe option. That's boxing OURSELVES in! \ud83d\ude31\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,1), we open up the board! From (1,1) we could go UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), or RIGHT to (2,1). That's FLEXIBILITY! Plus, we're moving toward the center where apples might drop!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\nSnake #1 is trapped! Their head at (4,9) with body blocking: (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)... They're running out of moves in that top-left cage. If they try to go DOWN to (4,8), it's empty on the board, but they might be forced into a corner soon!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nTake RIGHT to (1,1)! Keep our options open, stay mobile, and maintain pressure on the enemy. We want to be able to chase them down if they try to escape, not get stuck in a corner ourselves!\n\nFrom (1,1), next turn we can potentially move toward the center or snake up the left side to cut off their escape routes. We're playing chess, not checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n**Let's GOOOO!** \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nright",

They\u2019re stuck on the left \u2014 can\u2019t threaten our head this turn. We\u2019re down by 1 apple (16 vs 17), so we must avoid risky head-on double-KOs until we can force them into our body or reclaim the apple lead.\n\nMove tradeoffs:\n- DOWN to (4,8): safe, keeps access to (5,8) apple next turn, but nudges us toward our own clustered body on the lower center columns which could narrow escape lanes if we overcommit left afterward.\n- RIGHT to (5,9): safe, keeps two clean follow-up options (RIGHT to expand along top row or DOWN to hit (5,8) apple), preserves more open space to the right/top and reduces risk of self-boxing.\n\nWe want to stay flexible, keep multiple escape routes open, and pressure the map center so we can start hemming them in later. Also: don\u2019t bait a head-on \u2014 we\u2019re trailing. Be ready to force them into our body if they overextend.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n1) Slide RIGHT to keep maximum mobility and threaten the (5,8) apple without committing into tight corridors.  \n2) From there, expand right/top to create a sweeping arc that can fold back left and compress the opponent when they try to move up.  \n3) Avoid head-on until we either tie or lead in apples or can guarantee they run into our body.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it clean, keep it smart, and clip \u2019em when the door closes.

My tail is at (9, 0).\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 9) - Still in the corner!

That last apple was HUGE\u2014we're one step closer to dominating this game! \ud83d\udd25  \n\n**Board Analysis:**  \n- **My Head:** (1, 0) - We just moved DOWN to grab that apple!  \n- **My Body:** Now we've grown! Our body is: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0)]  \n  Wait\u2014actually, the head is at (1, 0) and the tail is now (9, 0)? But the body list shows the tail is at (9, 0) and we just added (1, 0) as new head. Need to be careful.  \n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 8) - They moved to (5, 8) from (5, 9) last turn. They\u2019re still trapped in the top-left area but might be trying to break out.  \n- **Apples Nearby:** From (1, 0), apples are at (0, 0)? No, (0, 0) is empty. (3, 0) is an apple (y=0, x=3). (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8) are apples but those are up.  \n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (1, 0):**  \n\n**LEFT:** (0, 0) - Board shows '.' (empty). Is it safe? My body: the segment behind my head is (1, 1) (since my head was (1,0) and body goes (1,1) etc.). So (0,0) is NOT part of my body. Enemy is far. SAFE.  \n\n**RIGHT:** (2, 0) - Board shows '.' (empty). Is it safe? My body doesn't occupy (2,0). Enemy is far. SAFE.  \n\n**UP:** (1, 1) - Board shows 'T'? Wait, the board state shows at (1,1) a 'T'? Actually, in the board state:  \nRow 1: \"T T . A . . . . . T\" so (1,1) is 'T'. That's my own body! (My body at (1,1) is listed in my body list). So UP would move into my own body \u2192 DEAD. Can't go UP.  \n\n**DOWN:** (1, -1) - That's off the board (y=-1). DEAD. Can't go DOWN.  \n\n**THREE SAFE OPTIONS?** Actually only LEFT and RIGHT are safe! UP and DOWN are lethal.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe're at the bottom edge at (1, 0). We have an apple at (3, 0) two steps to the right. But if we go RIGHT to (2, 0), from there we could then go RIGHT again to (3, 0) and eat that apple next turn. That would be great! But we need to be careful about the enemy's move. The enemy is at (5, 8) and might be moving down or right to escape.  \n\nIf we go LEFT to (0, 0), we'd be at the far left corner, which is risky because it might trap us later. Also, there's no apple at (0, 0).  \n\nSo the clear move is RIGHT to (2, 0). This:  \n1. Keeps us safe (not hitting our body or going off-board).  \n2. Moves us closer to the apple at (3, 0) for next turn.  \n3. Opens up future options: from (2, 0), we could go RIGHT (to apple), UP (to (2,1) which is empty), or LEFT (back to (1,0) which is safe).  \n4. We maintain our lead and keep pressure on the enemy.  \n\n**LET'S GOOO!** \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

OK.\n- RIGHT -> (6,8): free, gives 3 follow-ups (U, R, D) and straight access to the apple at (6,7). \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,7): free, but DOWN would leave only 2 safe follow-ups (L or R), and DOWN->DOWN would hit our body at (5,6). \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nOpponent (head at 1,0) can only go LEFT (0,0) or RIGHT (2,0) this turn \u2014 they\u2019re not remotely close to forcing a head-on with us. Important: we\u2019re trailing 17\u219218, so we should avoid risky head-ons until we can force them (we don\u2019t want a double KO while behind).\n\nEvaluation + risk:\n- LEFT is safe but constrains us (UP is blocked by our own body at (4,9)). Less flexibility.\n- DOWN is tempting to chase immediate angles, but it reduces options and risks squeezing us into our own body if we overcommit.\n- RIGHT opens the most escape/attack routes and keeps the apple at (6,7) easily reachable next turn. Getting that apple ties the score and gives us initiative without forcing a dangerous head-on.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n1) Move RIGHT now to (6,8). Keep options open.\n2) Next turn head DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple (ties the score). If safe, then press left/down to start compressing the opponent\u2019s left-side access.\n3) Avoid direct head-on until we either equalize and can bait them into your body or we trap them with walls/body segments. Be aggressive but keep multiple exits.\n\nLet\u2019s take the safe, flexible path and pounce on that apple next turn \u2014 we go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

He's desperate.  \n- **Apples Nearby:** (3, 0) is RIGHT next to us! That's a free point if we can grab it next turn.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (2, 0):**\n\n**LEFT:** (1, 0) - Board shows '.' (empty). My body DOES include (1, 0) as the segment behind my head. Wait, is (1, 0) still part of my body? Let's check: My body list starts with (1, 0) after the head (2, 0). So (1, 0) is my own body! Moving LEFT would crash into myself. **DEAD.**\n\n**RIGHT:** (3, 0) - Board shows 'A' (apple)! Moving onto an apple means I GROW and get +1 point, extending my lead to 19-17. Is it safe? My body: The segment behind my head is (1, 0) - so (3, 0) is NOT part of my body. Enemy is far at (6, 8). **SAFE and profitable!**\n\n**UP:** (2, 1) - Board shows '.' (empty). Is it safe? My body: (2, 1) is not in my body list. Enemy is far. **SAFE.** But no apple here.\n\n**DOWN:** (2, -1) - Off the board (y=-1). **DEAD.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nRIGHT is the clear move! It's the ONLY safe move that also gets us an apple. Eating (3, 0) keeps our lead growing and sets us up perfectly. From (3, 0) next turn, we could go RIGHT to (4, 0) (another apple!) or UP to (3, 1) (also an apple!). We're dominating the bottom row while the enemy is stuck in the top-left.

We must avoid reckless head-ons while we\u2019re close in score, but grabbing apples to equalize is exactly the move.\n\nRisk check:\n- DOWN eats an apple and is safe (no immediate collisions). After eating, we can still move L/R/D (UP would be backwards into our previous head), so we retain multiple follow-ups and don\u2019t get boxed immediately.\n- UP/RIGHT keep more immediate exits, but passing up the apple wastes a free equalizer and lets them keep the lead.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n1) Move DOWN now to (6,7) and eat the apple \u2014 tie the score 18\u201318 and GROW.\n2) After eating, pivot to pressure the center (use RIGHT/LEFT depending on opponent movement) while keeping 2+ escape routes. Avoid forcing a head-on until we can guarantee they crash.\n3) Look to slowly compress their accessible space toward the left wall \u2014 we\u2019ll bait and cut off escape lanes once we\u2019ve tied and grown.\n\nWe take the apple, tie the game, and keep our options.

Keep 2+ escape routes each turn; bait cuts and close lanes when they start hugging walls.\n\nTime to equalize and turn up the pressure. READY?

Eating another apple means GROWING and extending lead to 21-19. Is it safe? My body: (5, 0) is NOT in my body list. Enemy is at (7, 7) - far away. **SAFE and profitable!** From (5, 0) next turn, we can go RIGHT to (6, 0) (apple!) or UP to (5, 1) (empty but safe). Perfect.\n\n**UP:** (4, 1) - Board shows '.' (empty). Not an apple, but safe. However, we want apples to extend our lead! RIGHT gives immediate apple, UP doesn't. RIGHT keeps us on the bottom row where we have space.\n\n**DOWN:** (4, -1) - Off the board. **DEAD.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nRIGHT is the POWER MOVE! It's the safest apple grab that keeps us on the bottom row, building our wall while the enemy is trapped. We're at 20 apples, he's at 19. Every apple we eat forces him to take risks.

On the board, I see 'A' at:\n  - (0, 8)\n  - (9, 6)\n  - (0, 6)\n  - (7, 0)\n  - (4, 5) - Adjacent to my body\n  - (9, 7) - Adjacent to my body at (9, 6) and (9, 4)\n  - (3, 1) - Adjacent to my body at (3, 0)\n  - (0, 7)\n  - (0, 5)\n  - (6, 5)\n  - (9, 8)\n  - (4, 2)\n  - (5, 5)\n  - (0, 0)\n  - (6, 2)\n\nWait, the board representation is key. The grid shows characters:\nRow 9: `. . T T T T . . . .` (T is my body, top row is 9)\nRow 8: `A . T . . T T . . A`\nRow 7: `A . T . . . T T 1 A` (1 is enemy head)\nRow 6: `A . T T T . . . . A`\nRow 5: `A T T T A A A . . .`\nRow 4: `. T T T T T T T T T`\nRow 3: `T T T T T . . . . T`\nRow 2: `T . . . A . A . . T`\nRow 1: `T T . A . . . . . .`\nRow 0: `A T T T T 0 . A . .` (0 is my head)\n\nMy head is at (5, 0) on row 0. Row 0 is: `A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:T, 2:T, 3:T, 4:T, 5:0, 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.\nSo (5, 0) is my head. The character at (6, 0) is `.`. The character at (7, 0) is `A`.\nThe character at (5, 1) is `.` (Row 1 index 5 is `.`, confirmed by Row 1: `T T . A . . . . . .`).\nThe character at (4, 0) is `T` (my body).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (5, 0):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n    *   Target cell: `T` (my own body).\n    *   **Result:** Illegal move (hit self). **DEAD.**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 0):**\n    *   Target cell: `.` (empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Next Turn Options from (6, 0):**\n        *   Right to (7, 0): `A` (Apple). Safe.\n        *   Up to (6, 1): Row 1 index 6 is `.` (empty). Safe.\n        *   Left to (5, 0): My current head (tail will move). Safe.\n        *   Down: Off board.\n    *   **Immediate Apple?** No, but (7, 0) is the next cell.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, -1):**\n    *   Off board. **DEAD.**\n\n4.  **UP to (5, 1):**\n    *   Target cell: Row 1 index 5 is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Next Turn Options from (5, 1):**\n        *   Up to (5, 2): Row 2 index 5 is `.` (empty). Safe.\n        *   Right to (6, 1): Row 1 index 6 is `.` (empty). Safe.\n        *   Left to (4, 1): Row 1 index 4 is `A` (Apple). Safe.\n        *   Down to (5, 0): My current head (tail will move). Safe.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n- **RIGHT (to 6, 0):** Gets me closer to the apple at (7, 0). From (6, 0), I can turn Up or Right. If I go Right next, I eat (7, 0). This keeps me on the bottom edge but expanding territory. (7, 0) is a safe apple, no heads near it.\n- **UP (to 5, 1):** Opens up the interior. I see an apple at (4, 1) (Row 1 index 4 is `A`). That's adjacent. However, moving UP moves me away from the apple at (7, 0) which is very close. Also, moving UP puts me on row 1, which has bodies on the left (Row 1: `T T . A . . . . . .`). My body is at (0,1), (1,1). Moving to (5, 1) is far from them, so safe. But (5, 1) leads to (5, 2), (6, 1), (4, 1).\n\n**Score Analysis:**\nMy Score: 20\nEnemy Score: 19\nTurn: 52/150\nI am ahead by 1. I should secure points. (7, 0) is an apple. To get there, I need to go RIGHT to (6, 0) first.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy Head: (8, 7).\nEnemy is trapped in the top left quadrant? Let's look at the board.\nRow 7: `A . T . . . T T 1 A`. Enemy is at (8, 7). His body is at (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6).\nHe is surrounded by his own body and my body (T's).\nHe has apples nearby at (9, 7), (9, 8), (4, 5) etc.\nHe is likely to move Up, Left, or Right?\nRight (9, 7) is `A`. Left (7, 7) is his body. Up (8, 8) is `T` (My body? No, Row 8: `A . T . . T T . . A`. (8, 8) is index 8 which is `.`). Wait, check Row 8: `A . T . . T T . . A`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:T, 3:., 4:., 5:T, 6:T, 7:., 8:., 9:A.\nSo (8, 8) is empty. (7, 8) is empty.\nIf Enemy moves Up to (8, 8), he is safe.\nIf Enemy moves Right to (9, 7), he eats an apple (score 20).\nIf Enemy moves Left to (7, 7), he hits his own body (DEAD).\nIf Enemy moves Down to (8, 6), what is there? Row 6: `A . T T T . . . . A`. (8, 6) is index 8 which is `.`. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has safe moves.\nWhere is the enemy relative to me? (8, 7) is far away (top right ish). I am bottom left (5, 0).\nNo head-on collision threat.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want the apple at (7, 0). It's safe.\nTo get to (7, 0), I must be at (6, 0) first.\nIf I go UP now, I move away from that apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 0), I set up for eating (7, 0) next turn.\nIs (6, 0) safe?\nBoard at (6, 0) is `.`. My tail is at (9, 2). By the time I move to (6, 0), my tail moves from (9, 2) to (9, 3) (assuming I haven't eaten, but if I eat at (7, 0) next turn, I grow).\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (6, 0) now:\nMy new body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), ... (9, 2)].\nNext turn, if I move RIGHT to (7, 0) and eat:\nMy head becomes (7, 0). I grow. Tail stays at (9, 2) (or wherever it is after the first move).\nActually, checking the tail movement:\nCurrent Tail: (9, 2).\nCurrent Body ends at (9, 2). The second to last is (9, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 0):\nHead: (6, 0)\nBody includes: (5, 0), (4, 0)...\nThe tail moves to (9, 3).\nNext turn (if I eat at 7, 0):\nHead: (7, 0)\nBody: (6, 0), (5, 0)...\nTail stays at (9, 3) (because I grew).\nSo (6, 0) is definitely safe. (7, 0) is definitely safe.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP instead?\nIf I go UP to (5, 1), I am \"safe\".\nBut going RIGHT secures a path to an apple.\nI am leading 20-19. Every apple counts.\nI should play aggressively but safely. Taking the guaranteed apple route is smart.\nThe enemy is struggling in the corner. He might not even get to an apple next turn or might crash.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 0: `A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nWait, looking closely at Row 0 provided in the prompt:\n`A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nIndices:\n0: A (Apple)\n1: T\n2: T\n3: T\n4: T\n5: 0 (My Head)\n6: . (Empty)\n7: A (Apple)\n8: . (Empty)\n9: . (Empty)\n\nSo my head is at 5. (6, 0) is empty. (7, 0) is Apple.\nI am moving from 5 to 6.\nNext turn I can move from 6 to 7 to eat.\n\nIs there any danger?\nMy body is at (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0).\n(6, 0) is not in my body.\n(7, 0) is not in my body.\nEnemy is at (8, 7). Impossible to reach me in 1 turn.\nHead-on collision impossible.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nCheck UP just in case.\n(5, 1). Row 1: `T T . A . . . . . .`\nIndices: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.\nSo (5, 1) is empty.\nFrom (5, 1), I can go to (4, 1) (Apple), (5, 2) (Empty), (6, 1) (Empty).\nIt's also safe.\nHowever, (7, 0) is a \"sure thing\" if I go RIGHT.\nIf I go UP, I might chase (4, 1) or (3, 1) or (4, 5).\n(7, 0) is right there.\n\nLet's confirm the apple list.\nApples: (0, 8), (9, 6), (0, 6), (7, 0), (4, 5), (9, 7), (3, 1), (0, 7), (0, 5), (6, 5), (9, 8), (4, 2), (5, 5), (0, 0), (6, 2)\n(7, 0) is in the list.\n(3, 1) is in the list.\n(6, 2) is in the list.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 0):\nI am at (6, 0).\nApples available: (7, 0) (Right), (6, 2) (Up 2), (5, 5) (Up 5, Left 1).\nIf I go UP to (5, 1):\nI am at (5, 1).\nApples available: (4, 1)? No, (3, 1) is in list. (4, 2) is in list. (5, 5) is in list.\n(4, 1) is NOT in the apple list. I misread Row 1 index 3 as A, but it is A. Index 4 is `.`\nRow 1: `T T . A . . . . . .`\nSo (3, 1) is an apple.\n(4, 2) is an apple.\nGoing UP is slightly more complex. Going RIGHT is straightforward.\n\nLet's consider the \"Box him in\" strategy.\nI am at the bottom. My body forms a wall on the left and bottom.\nIf I go RIGHT, I extend my wall at the bottom.\nIf I go UP, I move into the center.\nThe prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\nThe enemy is in the top-left area (roughly).\nMy body is at (0,1) to (0,3) and (1,3) to (4,3) and (4,4) to (9,4).\nI am creating a \"cage\" on the bottom and left.\nMoving RIGHT extends the bottom wall towards the right.\nMoving UP opens space in the middle.\n\nWait, where is the enemy exactly?\nHead: (8, 7).\nBody: (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6).\nThe enemy is hugging the top-right corner of the top-left quadrant.\nMy wall is at y=4 (Row 4 is all T).\nThe enemy is above y=4 (y=5 to y=9).\nSo the enemy is *above* my horizontal wall.\nMy left wall is at x=0 (y=0 to y=3).\nMy bottom wall is at y=0 (x=0 to x=4).\nTo box him in, I need to prevent him from getting below y=4.\nMy body is already at y=4 from x=1 to x=9.\nThe only gap in my wall at y=4 is at x=0 (Row 4: `. T T T T T T T T T`).\nSo the only way for the enemy to get below y=4 is to pass through (0, 4) or around the right side.\n(0, 4) is empty. (1, 4) is `.` (Row 4 index 1 is `T`? Wait. Row 4: `. T T T T T T T T T`. Index 0 is `.`, Index 1 is `T`).\nSo (1, 4) is my body. (0, 4) is empty.\nThe enemy is at (8, 7). To get to (0, 4), he has to travel through his own body or my body.\nHe is effectively trapped above y=4.\nIf I move UP to (5, 1), I am moving away from y=4.\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 0), I stay at y=0.\nNeither move directly seals the box at (0, 4), but moving RIGHT keeps me on the perimeter.\nActually, if I move RIGHT, I am extending my \"reach\" on the bottom.\nIf I move UP, I am entering the arena.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nThe enemy is above. I am below.\nI should probably stay on the perimeter to maintain the \"box\".\nIf I go UP, I might cut off my own escape routes or create holes in my body structure?\nMy body is currently a long snake.\nTail at (9, 2). Body goes (9, 3), (9, 4)... (4, 4)... (4, 3)... (1, 3)... (1, 1)... (1, 0)... (4, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 0), I am at (6, 0).\nNext turn I eat (7, 0).\nThen I can go UP to (7, 1), etc.\nThis keeps me on the right side.\nIf I go UP to (5, 1), I go into the \"hallway\" between my body at (5, 4) and (4, 3) etc.\nActually, (5, 1) is relatively open space.\nBut (6, 0) is also open space.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(7, 0) is RIGHT there.\n(4, 1) is NOT an apple.\n(3, 1) IS an apple.\nIf I go UP to (5, 1):\nI can go LEFT to (4, 1) -> (3, 1) to eat. But (4, 1) is empty. (3, 1) is apple.\nOr I can go RIGHT to (6, 1) -> (6, 2) to eat (apple at 6, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 0):\nI can go RIGHT to (7, 0) to eat.\nOr UP to (6, 1) -> (6, 2) to eat.\n\nThe apple at (7, 0) is the lowest hanging fruit (literally).\nTaking it extends my lead to 21-19.\nThe enemy is at 19. He needs to eat to tie or beat me.\nIf he eats (9, 7), he gets 20.\nIf I eat (7, 0), I get 21.\nI need to be safe.\nIs there any risk of the enemy hitting me?\nEnemy at (8, 7).\nMy body is at (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4)...\nThe enemy is at y=7. I am at y=4.\nDistance is 3. He can't reach me next turn.\nSo safety is not an issue regarding the enemy.\n\nThe only danger is hitting myself.\nRIGHT to (6, 0): Safe.\nUP to (5, 1): Safe.\n\nWhich is better for \"boxing him in\"?\nMy body forms a barrier.\nIf I go RIGHT, I reinforce the bottom right.\nIf I go UP, I become a mobile hunter inside the box.\nPrompt: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\nUsually, boxing in implies staying on the walls/perimeter to shrink the available space for the enemy.\nMoving UP into the center reduces the \"boxed in\" effect because I'm not covering the perimeter anymore.\nSo, staying on the edge (RIGHT) seems more aligned with \"boxing him in\".\nHowever, I have an apple at (7, 0).\nIf I go UP, I leave the apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I get closer to the apple.\n\nLet's check the board state again.\nRow 0: `A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nWait, is (7, 0) safe? Yes, it's an apple.\nIs (6, 0) safe? Yes, it's empty.\nIs there any scenario where (6, 0) becomes dangerous?\nOnly if the enemy moves there. Impossible.\nOnly if I move there and my tail is there. My tail is at (9, 2). (6, 0) is far away.\n\nSo RIGHT is the move to get the apple.\nUP is a safe alternative if the apple wasn't there, but the apple IS there.\nI am leading 20-19. I should take the point.\nAlso, the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nTo force a head-on collision, I need to get close to the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (8, 7).\nMy current position is (5, 0).\nIf I go UP, I move towards the center, closer to (8, 7).\nIf I go RIGHT, I move to the right edge, away from (8, 7).\nDistance to enemy from (5, 0): sqrt((8-5)^2 + (7-0)^2) = sqrt(9+49) = sqrt(58) \u2248 7.6\nDistance from (6, 0): sqrt((8-6)^2 + 49) = sqrt(4+49) = sqrt(53) \u2248 7.3\nDistance from (5, 1): sqrt((8-5)^2 + (7-1)^2) = sqrt(9+36) = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.7\nSo UP brings me slightly closer.\nHowever, \"forcing a collision\" is a long-term plan. I need to survive first and get points.\nThe apple at (7, 0) is a guaranteed point. Points are King.\n\nLet's look at the long term.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 0) and eat (7, 0) next turn:\nI am at (7, 0) with score 21.\nFrom (7, 0), I can go UP to (7, 1).\nFrom (7, 1), I am closer to (8, 7).\nSo I can still chase him later.\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 1):\nI haven't gained a point.\nI am closer to (3, 1) and (4, 2) and (6, 2).\n(6, 2) is an apple.\n(3, 1) is an apple.\n(4, 2) is an apple.\nBut (7, 0) is right there on the edge.\n\nWait, look at the board map provided in the prompt:\n`0 A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nThe apple at (7, 0) is visible.\nThe apple at (0, 0) is also visible (Index 0 is A).\n(0, 0) is an apple. But I can't get there. I am at (5, 0). Left is blocked by my body.\nSo (7, 0) is the only reachable apple this turn or next.\n\nDecision:\nRIGHT is the best move. It secures the apple at (7, 0) next turn and keeps me on the perimeter (boxing strategy).\nUP is safe but delays the point and moves me into the \"arena\" rather than keeping the perimeter.\nGiven the \"boxing him in\" instruction, staying on the outside edge is better.\nAlso, \"Be aggressive\". Taking the apple is aggressive. It increases the score gap.\nIf I am 21-19, he has to take more risks.\n\nFinal check on safety:\nRIGHT to (6, 0).\nIs (6, 0) in my body? No.\nIs (6, 0) enemy body? No.\nIs (6, 0) off board? No.\nIs it backwards? No (Left is backwards).\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (7, 0) just to kill me? He is at (8, 7). Distance is huge. No.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the move.\n\nOne detail: The prompt asks to think out loud.\nI should explain why I'm not going UP to the \"obvious\" open space in the middle, but rather RIGHT to the edge.\nReasoning: Perimeter control, securing the apple, maintaining the \"box\" structure.\n\nThe apple at (7, 0) is a \"free\" apple.\nI will go RIGHT.\n\nWait, is there any trap?\nRow 0: `A T T T T 0 . A . .`\nIs there a hole at (6, 0)? No, it's `.`.\nIs there a trap at (7, 0)? No, it's `A`.\n\nOkay, I'm confident.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nPlan for next turn:\nFrom (6, 0), move RIGHT to (7, 0) to eat the apple and grow to 21 points. Then assess the board to close the trap on Snake #1.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\n(5, 0) -> RIGHT -> (6, 0). Correct.\n\nI will write the rationale emphasizing the perimeter strategy and the guaranteed apple.\n\nOne more check on the opponent's potential moves.\nSnake #1 is at (8, 7).\nPossible moves:\nUp (8, 8): `.` (empty). Safe.\nRight (9, 7): `A` (apple). Safe.\nDown (8, 6): `.` (empty). Safe.\nLeft (7, 7): `T` (his own body). DEAD.\nSo he has 3 safe moves. He will likely go for the apple at (9, 7) or move Up/Down.\nIf he goes Right to (9, 7), he eats. Score 20-20 (if I don't eat next turn).\nIf I eat (7, 0) next turn, I'm 21-20.\nIf he eats (9, 7) and I eat (7, 0), I lead by 1.\nIf he doesn't eat, I lead by 2.\nThis is good.\n\nIf I go UP now, I miss the apple at (7, 0) for at least one turn. That gives him a chance to catch up without me capitalizing on the close apple.\n\nSo, RIGHT is definitely the play.\n\nOne tiny thing: The prompt says \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nBUT it also says \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nAnd \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nTo have a higher score, I need apples.\nThe apple at (7, 0) is safe and on the way.\nI am focusing on the enemy by maintaining my position on the perimeter to limit his space, while simultaneously grabbing an apple to maintain my lead.\nThe apple is not the *focus*, it's the *tool*.\nThe focus is the enemy. By keeping him trapped above y=4, and extending my wall, I am focusing on him.\nIf I go UP, I break my wall formation slightly (by vacating the edge).\nSo RIGHT supports the \"focus on enemy\" strategy better than UP.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 52! We're leading 20-19 and the enemy is stuck in the top-left corner. Time to tighten the noose! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- **My Head:** (5, 0) - Bottom row, ready to expand.\n- **My Body:** Forms a solid wall from left to center (y=4) and bottom. Enemy is trapped above y=4. He can't get down without crashing into my wall or his own body.\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 7) - Trapped. He has safe moves (Up, Right, Down) but he's cornered.\n- **Apple Opportunity:** (7, 0) is RIGHT next to me on the board (Row 0: `A T T T T 0 . A . .`). It's a guaranteed point!\n\n**MOVES CONSIDERED:**\n\n**LEFT:** (4, 0) - My own body (T). **DEAD.**\n**DOWN:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n**UP:** (5, 1) - Empty. Safe, but moves me away from the perimeter and the easy apple at (7, 0). I want to keep the perimeter tight to box him in.\n**RIGHT:** (6, 0) - Empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm choosing **RIGHT** to secure the apple at (7, 0) next turn. This extends my lead to 21-19 and keeps me on the bottom edge, maintaining the structural integrity of my \"box\" around the enemy. Moving UP into the center would create gaps in my perimeter defense. I need to grow, but on *my* terms, by taking safe apples while controlling the board's edges.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (6, 0), I'll immediately grab the apple at (7, 0) to hit 21 points. Then I'll start closing in from the right side to finish this game.\n\nLET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

He has zero access to the bottom half of the board.\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 7) - He just moved Right to eat an apple (9, 7).

Moving **RIGHT** is the only logical move.\n1. **Score:** I eat (7, 0) and go to 21 apples.\n2. **Defense:** I extend my wall along the bottom row.

The enemy is still boxed in the top-left, but now I'm moving into the center of the board to expand my domain. Let's see what's next.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- **My Head:** (7, 0) - Just moved Right. I'm on the bottom row.\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 8) - He just moved Up to (9, 8). He's still trapped.\n- **Apple Status:** I just ate (7, 0). The next closest apples are (9, 0) to the Right, (6, 2) Up, and (7, 2) Up.\n\n**MOVES CONSIDERED from (7, 0):**\n\n**LEFT:** (6, 0) - This is my previous position. It's safe (my tail moves), but it's a backtrack. I just came from there. I want forward momentum!\n**DOWN:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n**RIGHT:** (8, 0) - Empty. Safe. This extends my wall along the bottom. It gets me closer to (9, 0) apple.\n**UP:** (7, 1) - Empty. Safe. This moves me off the bottom row into the interior. It opens up paths to apples at (6, 2) and (7, 2).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to keep the pressure on. Going **UP** is the best play.\n1. **Territory:** Moving to (7, 1) claims the central column. I can see the board from here.\n2. **Apple Access:** From (7, 1), I can reach (6, 2) or (7, 2) next turn. (8, 0) is further away from my current trajectory.\n3. **Defense:** The enemy is stuck at y=8. I have the entire bottom half secured. Moving Up doesn't expose me to him.\n4. **Aggression:** I need to be ready to cut off his escape routes. Being at (7, 1) positions me perfectly to intercept if he tries to drop down.\n\nIf I go Right, I stay on the edge, which is safe but limiting. Going **UP** maximizes my options and keeps the tempo high. I want to dominate the board, not just hug the walls.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:**\nFrom (7, 1), I'll look to secure an apple. (6, 2) or (7, 2) are prime targets. I need to watch where the enemy moves from (9, 8). He might try to loop around the top right or drop down if I leave a gap. By moving Up, I tighten the net.\n\nLET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Check four directions:\n- RIGHT -> (10,8) off board = instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN -> (9,7) is our neck (backwards) = illegal. \ud83d\udeab\n- UP -> (9,9) is in-bounds and empty. Safe now, but next turn UP is out of board and DOWN would be re-entering our current head cell (bad). Leaves only one good follow-up.\n- LEFT -> (8,8) is empty and safe. From (8,8) we still have multiple good follow-ups (up to 8,9 or left to 7,8), so it preserves more escape/boxing options.\n\nOpponent is way down at y=0 and boxed behind their own body \u2014 no immediate head-on threat. We should maximize future move freedom to set up a top-right squeeze rather than hug the top edge and lose options.\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay next turn):\n1) LEFT to (8,8) now to keep multiple escape routes and avoid getting cornered at the top edge.  \n2) Then pivot UP to (8,9) and creep left along the top; maintain a two-move safety set each turn.  \n3) Once we\u2019ve claimed the top-right corridor, start compressing leftwards to herd the opponent or bait them into a head-on if they come up \u2014 but only if we maintain advantage.\n\nMake the safe aggressive play \u2014 preserve options, then box.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is still at (9, 8), trapped in the top-left corner. We need to close the net.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS CURRENT (Turn 55 Start):**\n- **My Head:** (7, 1)\n- **My Body:** [(7, 0), (6, 0), ... (9, 4)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 8)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 7), ... (3, 6)]\n\n**MY MOVES FROM (7, 1):**\n1.  **UP:** (7, 2). **APPLE!** There is an apple at (7, 2) listed in the drop. **Safe?** Yes. My body is below me. Enemy is far away. (7, 2) is not occupied by enemy body (closest enemy body is at (6, 7) or (3, 6)).\n    *   *Consequence:* I eat the apple, grow to 22, and position myself at (7, 2).\n    *   *Future:* From (7, 2), I can access (7, 3) or (6, 2) or (8, 2). (7, 3) looks like it might be close to my tail (which is at (9, 4) -> (8, 4) ...). Actually, looking at the board map, (7, 3) is `.` (empty). Wait, the board map shows `.` at (7, 3). But the body list shows my tail goes up to y=4.\n    *   *Risk:* None immediate.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** (7, 0). **MY BODY.** This is where I just came from. My body is currently at (7, 0). Hitting myself = **DEAD**. *Eliminated.*\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (6, 1). **EMPTY.**\n    *   *Consequence:* No apple. Moves to (6, 1).\n    *   *Future:* From (6, 1), I can go to (6, 2) (Apple) or (5, 1) or (7, 1) (backtrack) or (6, 0) (My body).\n    *   *Comparison:* This is a \"side step\". I'm not capitalizing on the immediate apple at (7, 2).\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (8, 1). **EMPTY.**\n    *   *Consequence:* No apple.\n    *   *Future:* From (8, 1), I can go to (8, 2) (Apple?) or (9, 1) or (7, 1) (backtrack) or (8, 0) (My body).\n    *   *Comparison:* Also a side step.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe objective is to be aggressive and score. The enemy is trapped and not a threat right now. I have an apple at (7, 2) directly in front of me.\n- Moving **UP** gets me a point, putting me in the lead 22-21.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** denies the apple and gives the enemy time to breathe.\n- Moving **DOWN** is suicide.\n\n**VISUAL CHECK (Board Map 9x9):**\nRow 2: `T . . A A . A A . .`\n(7, 2) is an `A`. (6, 2) is an `A`. (5, 2) is `A`.\nMy head is at (7, 1).\nRow 1: `T T . A . . . 0 . .` (Wait, board map row 1 shows `0` at (7, 1)? No, map is static snapshot, I am at (7, 1) now).\nActually, looking at the map provided:\nRow 1 (y=1): `T T . A . . . 0 . .`\nWait, the map shows `0` at (7, 1)? No, that's my head now.\nThe map shows `A` at (7, 2).\nThe map shows `.` at (7, 3).\nThe map shows `.` at (7, 4)? No, my body is at (7, 4) according to the list. The map shows `T T T T T T T T T T` at row 4.\n**Correction:** My body goes from (9, 4) to (4, 4).\nMy head is at (7, 1).\nMy body is at (7, 0), (6, 0)... (9, 4).\nIf I go **UP** to (7, 2), my tail will move. The cell (7, 2) is currently empty (except for the apple).\nI will not hit my body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 2). Secure the center-left region. Then move towards (6, 2) or (7, 3) to keep expanding. The enemy is stuck at y=8, we just need to keep scoring to hit 30 or force him into a mistake.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI'm going **UP** to eat the apple and take the lead. Let's go!\n\nUP",

(7, 3) is safe from my own body.\n  2.  **DOWN:** (7, 1). **DEATH!** I am currently at (7, 2), and my body is immediately below me at (7, 1). Moving down is suicide.\n  3.  **LEFT:** (6, 2). **APPLE!** There is an apple at (6, 2). (6, 2) is safe from my body (my body is at (7, 1), (7, 0), etc., and the furthest left my body goes is x=0 but at different y's).\n  4.  **RIGHT:** (8, 2). Empty `.`. Safe from my body.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe are aggressive. We want points.\n- **UP** to (7, 3) is safe but doesn't score.\n- **LEFT** to (6, 2) is an apple and scores a point (23-21 lead).\n- **RIGHT** to (8, 2) is safe but doesn't score.\n\nWhy not go LEFT? Because if I go LEFT to (6, 2), I eat the apple, but I am moving closer to the left wall (x=0). If I go UP to (7, 3), I stay in the center of the board.\nActually, let's look at the board state. The enemy is at (8, 9) and (9, 9). They are stuck in the top right corner. I have free reign of the bottom half.\nIf I go **UP**, I open up moves to (6, 3), (7, 4) (my body, dangerous), (8, 3).\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am at (6, 2). From there I can go to (5, 2) (Apple), (6, 1) (Apple), or (6, 3).\nThe apple at (6, 2) is right there. I should take the point. BUT, if I take the apple at (6, 2), my body grows, and my tail is currently at (9, 4). That is far away. (6, 2) is safe.\nWait, let's check the board map again.\nRow 2: `. . . A A . A A . .`\nRow 3: `T T T T T . . . . .`\nRow 4: `. T T T T T T T T T`\n\nIf I go **UP** to (7, 3), I am safe. The square (7, 3) is empty.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 2), I eat the apple.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (8, 2), I am safe.\n\nIs there a trap? (6, 2) is an apple. My body is at (7, 1) and (7, 0). (6, 2) is not in my body.\nThe enemy is at y=9, so they aren't reaching me.\nI will go **LEFT** to claim the apple and extend my lead. Domination is key.\n\nWait, looking at the board map, there is an apple at (6, 2). But there is also an apple at (6, 1) (Row 1 has `T T . A ...`).\nActually, let's look at the board map provided in Turn 56.\nRow 2: `. . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, the prompt says \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\"\nThe board map shows: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nLet's parse the board map string:\n` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nCoordinates: x=0 to 9.\nx=0: `T`\nx=1: `.`\nx=2: `.`\nx=3: `A`\nx=4: `A`\nx=5: `.`\nx=6: `A`\nx=7: `A`\nx=8: `.`\nx=9: `.`\n\nWait, my head is at (7, 2). The map shows `A` at (7, 2)? No, the map is the state of the board *after* my last move? Or before?\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 56 / 150\". The board state usually reflects the current state.\nWait, the prompt says \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\".\nIf I am at (7, 2), and the map shows `A` at (7, 2), that means I am currently on an apple? Or the map is slightly off?\nLet's look at the map row 2 again: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, `T` usually denotes Tail or Body. `A` is Apple. `0` is Head.\nIf my head is at (7, 2), and the map shows `A` at (7, 2), that means there is an apple there.\nBut the prompt said \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\".\nLet's look at the previous turn. I moved UP from (7, 1) to (7, 2). The apple at (7, 2) was listed in the drops.\nSo I likely just ate the apple at (7, 2) in turn 55.\nSo at the start of turn 56, (7, 2) is empty (or just my body part).\nWait, the board map shows `0` at (7, 2)? No, the map shows `.` at (7, 2)?\nLet's look at the board map in the prompt:\n` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, let's look at the exact string: ` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, the previous turn map showed: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, the prompt says: \"BOARD STATE: ... 2 T . . A A . A A . .\"\nWait, look at the coordinates. (7, 2) is the 8th element in row 2.\nRow 2 string: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\n1: `T`\n2: `.`\n3: `.`\n4: `A`\n5: `A`\n6: `.`\n7: `A`\n8: `A`\n9: `.`\n10: `.`\n\nWait, let's index them.\nx=0: `T`\nx=1: `.`\nx=2: `.`\nx=3: `A`\nx=4: `A`\nx=5: `.`\nx=6: `A`\nx=7: `A`\nx=8: `.`\nx=9: `.`\n\nSo (7, 2) is `A`. That means there is an apple there.\nDid I eat it last turn? The prompt says \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\".\nIf I was at (7, 1) and moved UP to (7, 2), and (7, 2) had an apple, I would have eaten it.\nBut the board map shows an apple at (7, 2).\nThis implies I am not yet on (7, 2)? No, the prompt says \"Head: (7, 2)\".\nAh, the \"Board State\" might be a visual representation that includes apples but not the snakes? No, it has `T` and `1`.\nIt has `0`? No, it doesn't show `0`.\nWait, looking at the map:\n` 4 . T T T T T T T T T` (Row 4, y=4). My body is at (9,4)...(4,4). This matches `T T T T T T T T T` (ignoring x=0 which is `.`). My body occupies x=4 to x=9 at y=4.\nWait, my body list: `..., (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)`\nSo at y=4, x=4,5,6,7,8,9 are occupied.\nThe map shows: `. T T T T T T T T T`\nx=0: `.`\nx=1: `T`\nx=2: `T`\nx=3: `T`\nx=4: `T`\nx=5: `T`\nx=6: `T`\nx=7: `T`\nx=8: `T`\nx=9: `T`\nWait, my body is NOT at x=1,2,3. So the map `T`s at x=1,2,3 belong to the ENEMY.\nEnemy body at y=4: `..., (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)`\nYes! The map at y=4 shows Enemy body at x=1,2,3 and my body at x=4-9.\nSo the map is accurate for the current turn (Turn 56 start).\n\nSo, my head is at (7, 2).\nThe map at y=2 (Row 2) is: `T . . A A . A A . .`\nx=0: `T` (My body? No, my body is at y=0,1... wait, my body goes (7,0)... (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2)...)\nMy body at y=2: `(0, 2)` is body.\nSo x=0 at y=2 is `T` (My body).\nx=7 at y=2 is `A`.\nSo there is an apple at (7, 2).\nWait, if my head is at (7, 2), and the map shows an apple there, did I eat it?\nThe prompt says \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\".\nIt does NOT list (7, 2) in the drops for this turn?\nActually, let's check the list again.\nApple drops: (0, 8), (9, 6), (0, 6), (4, 5), (3, 1), (0, 7), (0, 5), (6, 5), (4, 2), (5, 5), (0, 0), (6, 2), (3, 2), (7, 6), (5, 6)\nWait, (7, 2) is NOT in this list?\nWait, look closer.\n(0, 8)\n(9, 6)\n(0, 6)\n(4, 5)\n(3, 1)\n(0, 7)\n(0, 5)\n(6, 5)\n(4, 2)\n(5, 5)\n(0, 0)\n(6, 2)\n(3, 2)\n(7, 6)\n(5, 6)\n\nNO (7, 2).\nSo the map shows `A` at (7, 2), but (7, 2) is NOT in the drop list provided.\nThis means the map is showing the CURRENT board state, and (7, 2) is an apple.\nWait, if I am at (7, 2) and there is an apple there, and I didn't eat it (because it's still there on the map), then I must have JUST moved there? No, the prompt says \"Head: (7, 2)\".\nIf I moved to (7, 2) and there was an apple, I would eat it, and it would disappear from the map (replaced by my head).\nIf the map shows `A` at (7, 2), and my head is at (7, 2), that's a conflict unless the map is static from the start of the turn and doesn't update the apple status until *after* I move?\nOR, maybe the apple at (7, 2) was eaten previously?\nWait, if I am at (7, 2), and the map shows `A` at (7, 2), it implies I am standing on an apple but haven't collected it yet? No, that's not how Snake works.\n\nLet's re-read carefully.\n\"Apple drops: ... (6, 2)...\".\nMap at y=2: `T . . A A . A A . .`\nx=6: `A`\nx=7: `A`\nx=8: `.`\nx=9: `.`\n\nSo there are apples at (6, 2) AND (7, 2)?\nBut (7, 2) is not in the list of drops provided in the prompt.\nWait, did I eat an apple at (7, 2) last turn?\nMy previous move was UP to (7, 2).\nPrevious turn map showed: `2 T . . A A . A A . .` (Wait, did it?)\nPrevious turn prompt: \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2), (3, 2), (7, 6)...\"\nPrevious turn map row 2: `2 T . . A A . A A . .` (Wait, I need to check the previous turn's map).\nActually, I don't have the previous turn's map text in the context window fully, but I can assume the map in the prompt is the CURRENT map.\nIf the current map shows `A` at (7, 2), and my head is at (7, 2), and I am supposed to move *from* (7, 2).\nThis implies I am *not* on the apple? Or the representation is slightly off.\n\nLet's look at the \"Apple drops\" list again. It lists apples currently on the board?\nOr is it the list of apples that will spawn?\nIn the game context, usually, \"Apple drops\" lists the locations of apples currently on the board.\nIf (7, 2) is not in the list, but the map shows `A` at (7, 2), this is a contradiction.\n\nLet's look at the map string again:\n` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, let's count the spaces.\n` 2` is the y-axis label.\nThen `T . . A A . A A . .`\nThis is 10 items.\nIndices 0-9.\n0: `T`\n1: `.`\n2: `.`\n3: `A`\n4: `A`\n5: `.`\n6: `A`\n7: `A`\n8: `.`\n9: `.`\n\nSo (7, 2) is the 8th item (index 7). It is `A`.\n(6, 2) is the 7th item (index 6). It is `A`.\n\nSo there are apples at (6, 2) and (7, 2).\nThe drop list provided: `(6, 2)` is in the list.\n`(7, 2)` is NOT in the list.\n\nWhy is (7, 2) not in the list?\nPossibility A: The map is static from the start of turn 55, and I ate the apple at (7, 2) in turn 55 (UP move), so it should be gone.\nPossibility B: The list \"Apple drops\" is incomplete or refers to something else (e.g., new spawns).\nPossibility C: The map includes my head as `A`? No, my head is `0` usually.\n\nWait, looking at the board state in the prompt:\n` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nIs it possible that `0` is represented as `A`? No, usually `0` is the head.\nIs it possible the map is wrong? No, I must trust the input.\n\nLet's look at the previous turn's \"Apple drops\".\nPrevious turn prompt included: \"Apple drops: ... (6, 2), (3, 2), (7, 6)...\"\nWait, the current prompt's \"Apple drops\" is the *list of all apples on the board*?\nOr is it the *new apples that dropped this turn*?\nThe phrasing \"APPLE DROPS:\" usually implies \"Here are the apples currently on the board\".\nIf so, (7, 2) should be in the list if it's an apple.\nSince (7, 2) is NOT in the list, but the MAP shows `A` at (7, 2), there is a discrepancy.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\nMaybe the map is not 0-indexed? No, it says \"Coordinates go from (0,0)\".\nMaybe the `A` at (7, 2) is actually my head?\nBut the prompt says \"Head: (7, 2)\".\nIf the map shows `A` at (7, 2), and `A` means apple, then I am standing on an apple.\nIf I am standing on an apple, I must have eaten it to get there.\nDid I eat an apple last turn?\nMy previous move was UP.\nMy head was at (7, 1). I moved to (7, 2).\nWas there an apple at (7, 2) last turn?\nThe previous turn's apple list (from memory of the prompt structure, not literal context) probably included (7, 2).\nWait, looking at the current turn's apple list: `(7, 6)` is there. `(6, 2)` is there.\nMaybe (7, 2) is NOT an apple.\nLet's look very closely at the string ` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nIs it possible the `A` at index 7 is actually a `0`? No, it's `A`.\nIs it possible the `A` represents my body? No, `T` is tail/body.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Apple drops\" list.\nIs it possible that the list provided is *exclusively* for this turn (new spawns)?\n\"APPLE DROPS: (0, 8), (9, 6)...\"\nIf it is spawns, then existing apples from previous turns are also there.\nBut usually, in these prompts, the list represents the *current* state of apples.\nIf (7, 2) is an apple, why isn't it in the list?\nMaybe I ate it?\nIf I ate it, I grew. My tail moves.\nMy tail is at (9, 4).\nIf I ate an apple, my tail stays put for this turn (since I grew).\nIf I didn't eat, my tail moves to (9, 3)?\nWait, my body list: `..., (8, 4), (9, 4)`\nIf I ate an apple, the tail (9, 4) stays.\nIf I didn't eat, the tail moves to (8, 4)? No, the tail is the last element.\nIf I move, the tail moves to the position of the second to last element.\nMy body: Head(7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) ...\nIf I didn't eat, the tail (9, 4) becomes (8, 4)? No, the body shifts.\nHead moves to new spot. Old head becomes body. Old tail is removed (unless eaten).\nSo if I didn't eat, the segment at (9, 4) disappears.\nIf I did eat, (9, 4) remains.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\nRow 4: ` . T T T T T T T T T`\nWait, `T` at (9, 4) is there.\nIf I didn't eat, (9, 4) would be empty (or whatever is there).\nIf I ate, (9, 4) is body.\n\nLet's check the map at (9, 4). It is `T`.\nSo (9, 4) is occupied.\nThis suggests I ate an apple recently (or the tail logic is complex).\n\nLet's look at the map at (7, 2).\nIt is `A`.\nIf I am at (7, 2), and it's `A`, and I haven't eaten it yet (impossible because I'm on it), OR the map is showing the board *before* I interact with it? No.\n\nLet's assume the map is the ground truth.\nIf (7, 2) is an apple, and I am at (7, 2), then I eat it *this* turn?\nNo, the turn just started. I am *currently* at (7, 2).\nThe prompt says \"Your Snake: Head: (7, 2)\".\nThis means I moved there in turn 55.\nSo in turn 55, I moved to (7, 2).\nIf (7, 2) had an apple in turn 55, I ate it.\nIf I ate it, it shouldn't be an apple now.\nSo the `A` at (7, 2) on the map must be wrong, OR it's not an apple.\nOR, maybe the map `A` represents my head?\nNo, standard notation: `0` or `H` is head, `T` is tail/body, `A` is apple.\n\nLet's look at the map string ` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nMaybe the `A` at (7, 2) is actually `0`?\nLet's check the font. `A` vs `0`. In some fonts, `0` is `O`.\nThe text is `A`.\nOkay, let's look at the apple drops again.\n`(6, 2)` is in the list.\n`(7, 2)` is NOT in the list.\nThis strongly implies (7, 2) is NOT an apple.\nThen why does the map show `A`?\nMaybe the map is slightly misaligned?\nLet's look at row 1 (y=1): `1 T T . A . . . T . .`\nRow 2 (y=2): `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nRow 3 (y=3): `3 T T T T T . . . . .`\n\nWait, if I am at (7, 2), and the map shows `A` at (7, 2), and I am supposed to believe the map, then I am on an apple.\nIf I am on an apple, I must have just moved there.\nDid I eat it?\nIf I ate it, my score increased.\nMy score is 22.\nWas it 21 before?\nThe prompt says \"Your snake apples: 22\".\nOpponent: 21.\nSo I am ahead.\nDid I get that point from (7, 2)?\nIf I ate (7, 2), then it's gone.\nIf the map shows `A`, maybe it's a visual bug, or maybe I didn't eat it?\nImpossible to not eat if I move onto it.\n\nLet's step back.\nI am at (7, 2).\nI need to move.\nWhere can I go?\nUP (7, 3). Map shows `.` at (7, 3) (Row 3).\nDOWN (7, 1). Map shows `T` at (7, 1) (Row 1: `... . . . T . .`).\nWait, Row 1: `1 T T . A . . . T . .`\nx=7 is `T`.\nSo (7, 1) is occupied by my body.\nDOWN is DEATH.\n\nLEFT (6, 2). Map shows `A` at (6, 2).\nApple drop list includes (6, 2).\nSo (6, 2) is definitely an apple.\nIs it safe?\nMy body is at (7, 1), (7, 0), etc.\nIs (6, 2) in my body?\nMy body is mostly along y=0, 1, 3, 4.\n(6, 2) is empty in my body list.\nSo LEFT is SAFE and SCORES.\n\nRIGHT (8, 2). Map shows `.` at (8, 2) (Row 2).\nIs it safe?\n(8, 2) is not in my body list.\nSo RIGHT is SAFE but doesn't score.\n\nUP (7, 3). Map shows `.` at (7, 3) (Row 3).\nIs it safe?\nMy body is at (7, 4).\n(7, 3) is empty.\nSo UP is SAFE.\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nLEFT gets me an apple (6, 2).\nUP opens up the area.\nRIGHT is also open.\n\nStrategy: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nEnemy is at (8, 9). They are far away.\nI should take the apple if safe.\nIs there any danger in taking (6, 2)?\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I eat the apple.\nMy body grows. My tail stays at (9, 4).\nNext turn, from (6, 2), I can go to (5, 2) (Apple on map), (6, 1) (Apple on map), or (6, 3).\n(6, 3) is empty on map.\nThis seems like a very strong position.\nIf I go UP to (7, 3), I don't get the point.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2), I don't get the point.\n\nIs there a reason NOT to take (6, 2)?\nThe only risk is if the enemy somehow reaches (6, 2) or cuts me off.\nThe enemy is at y=9. To reach y=2, they need 7 moves. I am already there.\nSo no risk.\n\nWait, let's check the map for (6, 1).\nRow 1: `1 T T . A . . . T . .`\n(6, 1) is `.`.\nWait, (6, 1) is empty?\nWait, (6, 1) is x=6, y=1.\nString: `T T . A . . . T . .`\nIndices: 0:T, 1:T, 2:., 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:T, 8:., 9:.\nWait, index 6 is `.`.\nSo (6, 1) is empty.\nIs (6, 1) in my body?\nMy body list: `... (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)...`\nSo (6, 1) is NOT in my body.\nSo (6, 1) is safe.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (6, 2) and eat the apple, I grow.\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am at (6, 2).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am adjacent to (6, 1).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am adjacent to (5, 2) (Apple) and (6, 3).\nThis is good.\n\nHowever, let's look at the board map again.\nRow 2: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nWait, what is the `T` at (0, 2)? My body.\nWhat is the `A` at (3, 2)? Apple.\nWhat is the `A` at (4, 2)? Apple.\nWhat is the `.` at (5, 2)? Wait, the string says `A A .`.\nWait, `A A .` at indices 3, 4, 5.\nSo (5, 2) is `.`.\nWait, earlier I thought (5, 2) was `A`.\nLet's re-read: `2 T . . A A . A A . .`\n1. `T` (x=0)\n2. `.` (x=1)\n3. `.` (x=2)\n4. `A` (x=3)\n5. `A` (x=4)\n6. `.` (x=5)\n7. `A` (x=6)\n8. `A` (x=7)\n9. `.` (x=8)\n10. `.` (x=9)\n\nSo:\n(3, 2) = Apple\n(4, 2) = Apple\n(6, 2) = Apple\n(7, 2) = Apple (My head)\n(5, 2) = Empty\n\nSo the apple at (6, 2) is real.\nThe apple at (7, 2) is real (but I'm standing on it).\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), I eat that apple.\nThen I am at (6, 2).\nFrom there, I can go to (5, 2) (Empty), (6, 1) (Empty), (6, 3) (Empty), (7, 2) (My tail).\nWait, if I move LEFT, my tail moves.\nIf I ate an apple, my tail stays at (9, 4).\nIf I didn't eat (impossible), my tail moves to (8, 4).\nSince I am eating (6, 2), my tail stays.\nSo (7, 2) will become part of my body (since my head moves to (6, 2), the old head (7, 2) becomes body).\nSo next turn, if I am at (6, 2), I cannot go BACK to (7, 2) because it will be my body.\nThat's fine. I have other options.\n\nIs there any threat from the enemy?\nEnemy head (8, 9).\nTheir body: `..., (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)`\nThey are contained in x=1..8, y=4..9.\nThey are far.\nI am safe.\n\nSo, I will take the apple at (6, 2).\nMove: LEFT.\n\nWait, let's double check the \"Apple drops\" list again.\n`(6, 2)` is explicitly in the list.\n`(7, 2)` is NOT in the list.\nIf the map shows `A` at (7, 2), and it's not in the list, maybe the map is showing the apple I just ate?\nOr maybe the `A` on the map at (7, 2) is actually my head?\nIf the map uses `A` to represent the player's head?\nNo, usually `0`.\nIf the map uses `A` for \"Apple\", and my head is at (7, 2), and there's no apple there (since it's not in the list), then the map is misleading or `A` represents something else.\nBut I must rely on the board map for spatial awareness.\nIf the map says `A` at (7, 2), and I am at (7, 2), then I am on an apple.\nIf I am on an apple, and I move away, do I lose the apple?\nNo, in Snake, you eat when you enter the cell.\nIf I am *currently* on an apple, I should have eaten it *previous* turn.\nIf I didn't eat it, it's because I just spawned there? No.\nThis implies the apple at (7, 2) is either:\n1. A visual artifact on the map.\n2. An apple I haven't eaten yet (impossible if I moved there).\n3. The map is showing the state *before* I moved there? No, the state is \"Turn 56\".\n\nLet's look at the \"Apple drops\" list again.\nIt's a list of 15 apples.\nAre there exactly 15 `A`s on the map?\nLet's count the `A`s on the map.\nRow 8: `A . T . . T T . T T` -> 1 apple (0, 8)\nRow 7: `A . T . . . T T T T` -> 1 apple (0, 7)\nRow 6: `A . T . . A . A . A` -> 4 apples (0, 6), (5, 6)? Wait, (5, 6) is `.`? No, (5, 6) is `.`? Wait, the string is `A .

The map has 16 `A`s.\nWhich `A` on the map is NOT in the list?\nList: (0, 8), (9, 6), (0, 6), (4, 5), (3, 1), (0, 7), (0, 5), (6, 5), (4, 2), (5, 5), (0, 0), (6, 2), (3, 2), (7, 6), (5, 6)\nLet's cross-reference with map apples:\n(0, 8) - Yes (Map row 8, index 0)\n(9, 6) - Yes (Map row 6, index 9)\n(0, 6) - Yes (Map row 6, index 0)\n(4, 5) - Yes (Map row 5, index 4)\n(3, 1) - Yes (Map row 1, index 3)\n(0, 7) - Yes (Map row 7, index 0)\n(0, 5) - Yes (Map row 5, index 0)\n(6, 5) - Yes (Map row 5, index 6)\n(4, 2) - Yes (Map row 2, index 4)\n(5, 5) - Yes (Map row 5, index 5)\n(0, 0) - Yes (Map row 0, index 0)\n(6, 2) - Yes (Map row 2, index 6)\n(3, 2) - Yes (Map row 2, index 3)\n(7, 6) - Yes (Map row 6, index 7)\n(5, 6) - Yes (Map row 6, index 5)\n\nWait, map row 6: `A . T . . A . A . A`\nIndex 5 is `A`. So (5, 6) is an apple.\nThe list has (5, 6).\nSo all apples in the list are on the map.\nBut I counted 16 apples on the map.\nLet's recount the map `A`s carefully.\nRow 8: `A . T . . T T . T T` (1 apple: 0,8)\nRow 7: `A . T . . . T T T T` (1 apple: 0,7)\nRow 6: `A . T . . A . A . A` (4 apples: 0,6; 5,6; 7,6; 9,6)\nRow 5: `A T T T A A A . . .` (4 apples: 0,5; 4,5; 5,5; 6,5)\nRow 4: `. T T T T T T T T T` (0 apples)\nRow 3: `T T T T T . . . . .` (0 apples)\nRow 2: `T . . A A . A A . .` (4 apples: 3,2; 4,2; 6,2; 7,2)\nRow 1: `T T . A . . . T . .` (1 apple: 3,1)\nRow 0: `A T T T T T T T . .` (1 apple: 0,0)\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16.\nThe extra apple is at (7, 2).\nThe list does NOT contain (7, 2).\nSo (7, 2) is an apple on the map, but not in the list.\nThis implies (7, 2) is NOT an apple, or the map is showing my head as `A`.\nIf the map uses `A` for the player's head, then (7, 2) is `A` because I am there.\nBut usually `0` is used.\nIf `A` is my head, then (3, 1) is also `A`. Is (3, 1) my head? No.\nSo `A` is likely \"Apple/Item\".\nSo why is (7, 2) an apple but not in the list?\nMaybe the list is \"New drops\"?\n\"APPLE DROPS:\"\nUsually implies \"Here are the apples\".\nIf the list is \"New drops\", then old apples remain.\nBut in these games, usually, the list is the *current* state of all apples.\nIf the list is current, and it's missing (7, 2), then (7, 2) is NOT an apple.\nBut the map shows `A`.\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nLet's look at the map representation.\n` 2 T . . A A . A A . .`\nMaybe the `A` at (7, 2) is actually a `0` (my head)?\nVisually `A` vs `0`?\n`A` has two diagonal lines. `0` is a circle.\nIn text, they look different.\nBut maybe the font used by the user renders them similarly? Or maybe it's a typo in the prompt?\nIf I assume the map is correct, (7, 2) is an apple.\nIf I assume the list is correct, (7, 2) is NOT an apple.\nIf (7, 2) is NOT an apple, then why is it `A` on the map?\nMaybe the map is showing the state of the board *including* my head as `A`?\nIf so, then (3, 1) is `A`. Is my head at (3, 1)? No.\nMaybe the map uses `A` for \"Apple or Snake Head\"?\nNo, `T` is used for snake body.\nIf `A` is \"Apple or Head\", then (3, 1) is apple (which is in the list). (7, 2) is Head.\nThis seems plausible!\nLet's check.\nIf `A` = Apple OR Head.\n(3, 1) is `A`. It's in the apple list. So it's an apple.\n(7, 2) is `A`. It's NOT in the apple list. So it must be my Head.\nThis fits perfectly!\nThe map notation is likely:\n`0` = Head (maybe not used in this specific map visualization)\n`A` = Apple or Head?\n`T` = Tail/Body\n\nWait, look at the board state for row 4.\n` 4 . T T T T T T T T T`\nMy head is NOT at y=4.\nMy body is at y=4.\nSo `T` is definitely body.\nIf `A` is Head, then (7, 2) is Head.\nAre there any other `A`s that are heads?\n(8, 9) is `1` (Opponent Head).\nSo (8, 9) is `1`.\nSo `A` is not the opponent head.\nSo `A` might be my head!\nBut (3, 1) is `A`.\nIs my head at (3, 1)? No, I am at (7, 2).\nSo (3, 1) is an apple.\nSo `A` is ambiguous: Apple or My Head?\nBut (3, 1) is definitely an apple (in the list).\n(7, 2) is NOT in the list.\nSo (7, 2) must be My Head.\nThis makes sense!\nThe map uses `A` to represent *either* an apple OR the player's head.\nSince my head is at (7, 2) and it's not an apple (not in list), the map shows `A` for my head.\nThis is a consistent interpretation.\n\nSo, (7, 2) is my head. It is NOT an apple.\nI am NOT standing on an apple.\nTherefore, if I move LEFT to (6, 2), I WILL eat an apple (because (6, 2) is in the list and `A` on map).\nIf I move UP to (7, 3), I do NOT eat an apple (map shows `.`).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 2), I do NOT eat an apple (map shows `.`).\n\nSo, my move LEFT to (6, 2) scores a point.\nMy move UP to (7, 3) is safe but doesn't score.\nMy move RIGHT to (8, 2) is safe but doesn't score.\n\nI should take the point. (6, 2) is an apple.\nIs (6, 2) safe?\nMy body: `... (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0) ...`\n(6, 2) is not in the body list.\nSo it is safe.\n\nWait, let's check the map at (6, 2) again.\nMap: `T . . A A . A A . .`\n(6, 2) is `A`. (Apple).\n(5, 2) is `.`.\n(4, 2) is `A`.\nSo there are apples at (4, 2) and (6, 2).\n(5, 2) is empty.\nIf I go to (6, 2), I eat the apple.\nNext turn, I can go to (5, 2) (empty), (6, 1) (empty), (6, 3) (empty).\nThis is a very strong move.\n\nHowever, is there any risk?\nThe enemy is at (8, 9).\nThey are far.\nI am safe.\n\nOne thing to consider: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score.\"\nMy score is 22. Enemy is 21.\nI should extend the lead.\nTaking the apple is aggressive.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nIf I go UP to (7, 3), I am at (7, 3).\nFrom there, I can go to (7, 4) (My body - Danger!), (6, 3), (8, 3).\n(7, 4) is my body (x=7, y=4 is in the list `... (7, 4) ...`).\nSo if I go UP to (7, 3), I must be careful NOT to go UP again next turn.\nGoing UP limits my options because I have my body immediately above me (at y=4).\nWait, distance from (7, 3) to (7, 4) is 1.\nIf I go UP, I trap myself against my own body (which is at y=4, x=4..9).\nSo going UP is actually risky because it puts me right under my own body wall.\nFrom (7, 3), I can go LEFT (6, 3), RIGHT (8, 3), or DOWN (7, 2).\nDOWN is backtracking, which is usually bad, but possible.\nBut being sandwiched against my own body is not ideal.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2), I am at y=2.\nMy body at y=4 is two steps away.\nI have space to breathe.\nAlso, (6, 2) is an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2), I am at (8, 2).\nMap shows `.`.\nIs (8, 2) safe? Yes.\nFrom (8, 2), I can go to (8, 3), (9, 2), (8, 1), (7, 2).\n(9, 2) is empty on map.\n(8, 1) is `T` (My body).\nSo from (8, 2), I can't go DOWN.\nI can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nThis is also good.\nBut (8, 2) has no apple.\n(6, 2) has an apple.\nSo LEFT is better than RIGHT.\n\nSo the choice is between LEFT (score, good space) and UP (no score, tight space).\nI will go LEFT.\n\nDouble check safety of (6, 2).\nEnemy body: `..., (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)`\n(6, 2) is far away.\nMy body: `... (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)...`\n(6, 2) is clear.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nTake the apple at (6, 2). From there, evaluate moves to (5, 2) or (6, 1) or (6, 3). Continue to expand territory and maintain lead. Watch out for enemy moving down, but they are currently cornered.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nResponse format requires thinking out loud, short plan, and then the single word.\n\nPlan: Take the apple at (6, 2) to extend the lead to 23-21. Avoid getting sandwiched between my own body at y=4 and the bottom. (6, 2) provides better breathing room than (7, 3).\n\nWait, I should check if (6, 2) is actually safe.\nIs there any scenario where an enemy moves into (6, 2)?\nNo, they are at y=9.\nIs there any scenario I hit myself?\nNo, (6, 2) is not in body list.\n\nLet's write the response.",

My opponent is trapped in the top right corner like a rat in a cage, and we have the whole board to ourselves.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **Current Head:** (6, 2)\n- **Potential Moves:**\n  1. **LEFT:** (5, 2). Looking at the board map, (5, 2) is an **APPLE**! `Row 2: . . A A . A A . .` (Wait, let's check that map again). Map Row 2: `T . . A A . A A . .` (x=0 to 9). At x=5, y=2, the map shows `A`. **WE EATING GOOD TONIGHT!** Plus, (5, 2) is safe. My body is at (6, 2) (current head) and (7, 1) downwards. The enemy is at y=9. This is a free point.\n  2. **RIGHT:** (8, 2). Map shows `.` (Empty). Safe, but no point. Boring.\n  3. **UP:** (7, 3). Map shows `.` (Empty). Safe, but no point. Also, this puts me directly underneath my own massive body wall at y=4 (which stretches from x=4 to x=9). If I go up, I'm boxing myself in against my own tail. I don't want to get trapped against my own body.\n  4. **DOWN:** (6, 1). Map shows `T` (My body). **DEATH.** My tail is literally right there from when I slithered through.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are ahead. We don't need to take stupid risks.\n- **LEFT** to (5, 2) gives us a guaranteed apple (24-21 lead). It keeps us low on the board where we have space to maneuver.\n- **UP** to (7, 3) is safe but blocks off the bottom of the board for future turns.\n- **RIGHT** to (8, 2) is safe but wastes a turn.\n\nWe take the point. We extend the lead. We put more distance between us and the 30-apple win condition while the enemy is stuck in the corner.\n\n**SHORT LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (5, 2) to extend the lead to 24-21. From (5, 2), I can likely move to (5, 1) or (4, 2) next (both look open on the map). I need to keep rotating around the bottom left quadrant to stay safe and hunt for the next spawn. Don't get greedy and drive into a wall. Keep the pressure on the enemy by simply not dying and getting bigger.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe apple is right there. It's free real estate. I'm taking it.\n\nLEFT",

Don\u2019t force a head-on \u2014 we\u2019ll lose that trade unless we can guarantee apples. Opponent is down low and mostly boxed into the bottom/left corridor.\n- Both LEFT and DOWN are legal, but both lead into tight space due to our own body layout. LEFT to (6,9) keeps us along the top row and continues compressing the board horizontally; it preserves control of the high ground and keeps pressure on the opponent\u2019s escape options.\n- DOWN to (7,8) is a tighter squeeze \u2014 surrounded by multiple body segments (6,8 / 7,7 / 8,8). That\u2019s more likely to become an immediate trap with fewer follow-ups.\n- No immediate head-on threat from #0 (he\u2019s far away at (6,2)), so aggressive board control is the play.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to claim the top corridor and force the game\u2019s bottleneck toward the opponent.\n- From the top, look to snake left/right to hem him in and bait him into tighter moves; only force head-on if we can ensure we\u2019ll have the apple advantage at that moment.\n- Watch his approach options (he can move up/left/down). If he tries to cut upward, pivot to trap \u2014 otherwise keep compressing and avoid single-cell dead-ends.\n\nLEFT",
