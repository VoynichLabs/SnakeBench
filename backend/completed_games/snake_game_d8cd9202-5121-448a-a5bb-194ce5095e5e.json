No bodies yet, so no immediate crash risks except\u2026 head-on collisions this turn? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFirst, check all four moves from (2,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (2,10) \u274c Off the board! DEAD. Eliminated.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8) \u2705 Empty, in bounds.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,9) \u2705 Empty, in bounds.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,9) \u2705 Empty, in bounds.\n\nAll three are safe from immediate suicide. Now, predict enemy moves from (1,7). He can go UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6), LEFT to (0,7), RIGHT to (2,7). All safe for him too.\n\nHead-on collision risk? If I go DOWN to (2,8) and he goes UP to (1,8) \u2192 no collision. If I go LEFT to (1,9) and he goes\u2026 nowhere near me. If I go RIGHT to (3,9) and he goes\u2026 nowhere near me. So no direct same-cell risk this turn.\n\nBut long-term strategy: I want to pressure him, cut off his space, maybe force him into a wall or trap. Right now he's below me. If I go DOWN to (2,8), I'm closer to him, maybe block his upward escape later. If I go LEFT or RIGHT, I'm staying on top row, maybe less aggressive.\n\nAlso apples: closest apple to me is at (4,9) top row, but that's far right. Going RIGHT moves toward it. But chat said focus on enemy, not apples. So be aggressive!\n\nLet's think about his possible moves: He might go for apple at (1,1) or (3,2) eventually, but first he might try to grow. If I go DOWN to (2,8), I'm directly above him by one row. Next turn I could go DOWN again to (2,7) and possibly meet him head-on if he moves up? But I have equal length (0 apples each), so head-on would kill us both. Not good unless I have length advantage.\n\nHmm. Actually, maybe I should go for an apple first to get length advantage, THEN force head-on. But risky if he does same.\n\nLet's check safe follow-up moves from each option:\n\n- From (2,8): can go UP (back to (2,9)), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8). All likely safe next turn unless he moves into those.\n- From (1,9): can go DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9). Slightly more constrained.\n- From (3,9): can go DOWN (3,8), LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9) where apple is.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (3,9) keeps more options open and moves toward apple at (4,9). That gives me growth potential. Then I can come down toward enemy with length advantage.\n\nYeah, I think that's the play. Get first apple, get longer, then hunt.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (4,9) if possible, move down toward enemy, try to cut off his space, force him to crash into me or wall. Keep an eye on his possible moves each turn.\n\nAlright chat, we're going for the apple first, then we hunt! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check my four moves from (3,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (3,10) \u274c OFF BOARD \u2192 DEAD. Eliminated.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,8) \u2705 Empty, in bounds.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2705 Empty, in bounds.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) \u2705 Empty, in bounds (and there's an apple at (4,9)!! \ud83c\udf4e).\n\nAll three are safe from immediate suicide. Now predict enemy moves from (1,8). He can go UP to (1,9), DOWN to (1,7), LEFT to (0,8), RIGHT to (2,8). All safe for him.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn? If I go DOWN to (3,8) and he goes RIGHT to (2,8) \u2192 different cells, no collision. If I go LEFT to (2,9) and he goes UP to (1,9) \u2192 different cells. If I go RIGHT to (4,9) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision. So all safe from head-on.\n\nBut long-term: I want to pressure him, maybe cut off his space. If I go RIGHT, I eat the apple at (4,9) immediately, giving me length advantage (1 apple vs 0). That's HUGE! With length advantage, I can force head-on collisions later and survive while he dies. That's the aggressive play.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,9), I'm moving away from the closest apple and not gaining advantage. If I go DOWN to (3,8), I'm moving toward the middle but no immediate growth.\n\nGoing RIGHT gets me the apple, grows my snake, and keeps me on top row with options to go DOWN next turn toward the enemy. Also, being longer means my body will start occupying space, limiting his moves.\n\nLet's think about his likely move: He might go for apple at (1,1) or (4,8)? But he's at (1,8), apple at (4,8) is close. He might go RIGHT toward (4,8) over multiple turns. If I go RIGHT and eat (4,9), next turn I can go DOWN to (4,8) and possibly beat him to that apple or block him.\n\nYES! That's the plan: Eat (4,9) now, then next turn go DOWN to (4,8) to either eat that apple or intercept him if he tries to go there. With length advantage, I can be more aggressive.\n\nAlso, going RIGHT leaves me with safe follow-ups: from (4,9) I can go DOWN to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9), or RIGHT to (5,9) (in bounds). Multiple options.\n\nLEFT from (2,9) gives me DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), RIGHT to (3,9). Also okay but no growth.\n\nDOWN from (3,8) gives me UP to (3,9), DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8). Also okay but again no immediate growth.\n\nSo RIGHT is the move for growth and board control. Let's get that apple and start DOMINATING! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (4,9), move DOWN to (4,8) if safe to either eat that apple or block enemy. Use length advantage to pressure him, force him into walls or into my body. Keep an eye on his possible moves each turn to avoid unexpected head-on before I'm longer.\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent #1\u2019s head sits at **(4,\u202f9)** with a tail on **(3,\u202f9)**.  \n- **Opponent\u2019s options** \u2013 They can go **DOWN** to **(4,\u202f8)** (an apple) or **RIGHT** to **(5,\u202f9)**. Going **LEFT** would hit their own body, and **UP** is off\u2011board.  \n- **My safe squares** \u2013 All four directions are free right now:  \n  * **UP** \u2192\u202f(2,\u202f9) \u2013 empty, top edge, far from any immediate threat.  \n  * **DOWN** \u2192\u202f(2,\u202f7) \u2013 empty, but moves me away from the juicy apple line at (4,\u202f8)/(5,\u202f8).  \n  * **LEFT** \u2192\u202f(1,\u202f8) \u2013 empty, but pulls me into the lower\u2011left quadrant where apples are far away.  \n  * **RIGHT** \u2192\u202f(3,\u202f8) \u2013 tempting because it lines up with the apple cluster, yet the opponent will most likely snap up **(4,\u202f8)** this turn, locking that cell for them and cutting off my quick access next move.  \n\n- **Strategic choice** \u2013 Going **UP** keeps me on the top row, preserves all four directions for the next turn, and forces the opponent to commit either **DOWN** (grab the apple and grow) or **RIGHT** (slide away). Either way I stay safe and retain the flexibility to swing left or right later, setting up a future box around their growing tail.  \n\n**Bottom line:** stay on the high ground, keep options open, and let the rival take that apple while I plot the trap.\n\nUP",

LET'S PRESS THAT ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHECK MY FOUR MOVES FROM (4,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,10) \u274c OFF BOARD (y=10, max is 9) \u2192 DEAD. NO.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8) \u2705 In bounds. Is it safe? Cell (4,8) currently has an apple 'A' (no snake). No enemy body there. But WAIT \u2014 enemy head is at (2,8). Could he move into (4,8) this turn? He's two cells away, so no. But simultaneous move means he could move toward it. We'll evaluate collision risk later. For now, not an immediate suicide.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,9) \u2705 In bounds. That's my own body segment! \u274c Moving LEFT would crash into my own body at (3,9) \u2192 DEAD. ELIMINATE.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,9) \u2705 In bounds. Empty cell ('.'). Safe from immediate suicide.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\nNOW PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (2,8):\nHe can go UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8). All are in bounds and empty except (2,9) is empty, (3,8) is empty, (1,8) is empty, (2,7) is empty. So all four are safe for him.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? \ud83e\udd14\nIf I go DOWN to (4,8) and he goes RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 different cells, no collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,8) and he goes UP/DOWN/LEFT \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,9) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision (he's at y=8, I'd be at y=9).\nSo both my safe moves avoid head-on this turn.\n\nBUT LONG-TERM STRATEGY: I have length 2 (head + 1 body), he has length 1. With length advantage, I can FORCE head-on collisions later and survive while he dies! So I want to pressure him, cut off his space, maybe chase him toward a wall.\n\nLOOK AT THE BOARD: He's at (2,8). Apples at (4,8) and (5,8) are close to him. He'll likely move RIGHT toward those apples. If I go DOWN to (4,8), I TAKE that apple right now! That grows me to length 3, extends my lead to 2 apples vs 0. HUGE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,9), I'm moving away from the apples and not growing. That's passive.\n\nGOING DOWN to (4,8) gives me the apple, increases my score, and puts my head closer to him. Next turn from (4,8) I could go DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,8), or RIGHT to (5,8) (another apple!). That's aggressive.\n\nRISK? From (4,8) next turn, if he's at (3,8) (he moved RIGHT), then we'd be adjacent. Could be risky, but with length 3 vs 1, I could potentially force a head-on and win. But let's think about HIS likely move THIS turn: He probably wants the apple at (4,8) too. He might go RIGHT to (3,8) to set up moving to (4,8) next turn. But if I go DOWN to (4,8) now, I GET IT FIRST and he can't. He'll be at (3,8) and I'll be at (4,8). Then next turn, if he tries to move into (4,8) (my current head), he'd crash into my body (since I'll move away, leaving my body at (4,8)? Wait, careful: If I eat apple at (4,8), my tail stays at (3,9), my body becomes [(4,9), (3,9)], head at (4,8). So (4,8) is my head now, not my body. If he moves from (3,8) to (4,8) next turn, that's a head-on if I'm still there. But I won't be there \u2014 I'll move somewhere else. So his move into (4,8) would hit my *previous* head position? No, snakes move simultaneously. If I move from (4,8) to somewhere else, my old head cell becomes part of my body (the neck). So if he moves into (4,8) on the turn after I left it, he'd crash into my body and die! That's a trap! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo going DOWN to (4,8) sets up potential body blocks.\n\nWHAT ABOUT GOING RIGHT to (5,9)? That avoids the apple, delays growth, and gives him space. Not aggressive enough.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE HERE TO DOMINATE! We have the length advantage, let's press it! Take the apple, grow, and start boxing him in toward the top-right corner? He's at (2,8), top row is y=9. If I take (4,8) and (5,8) soon, I can cut off his access to the right side.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: After eating apple at (4,8), move to (5,8) next if safe to eat another apple and further block him. Use my growing body to limit his moves. Keep him trapped against the top wall. Force him into a corner where he has no safe moves.\n\nDOWN is the move for growth, aggression, and board control! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

The only safe squares are **DOWN** to (2,8) or **LEFT** to (1,9). **RIGHT** is blocked by the opponent\u2019s body at (3,9) and **UP** is off\u2011board.\n- **Opponent\u2019s next move:** Their head is at (4,8). They\u2019ll likely go **RIGHT** for the apple at (5,8) or **LEFT** to (3,8). Either way, they won\u2019t be moving into (2,8) this turn.\n- **Why NOT LEFT?** Heading to (1,9) takes me farther from the action and isolates me on the far\u2011left side of the top row. It also reduces my ability to contest the apple at (4,8) once they vacate it.\n- **Why DOWN?** Dropping to (2,8) keeps me right beneath the opponent\u2019s head corridor. If they move **RIGHT** for the apple, (4,8) becomes free and I can snag it on the following turn. It also preserves flexibility: from (2,8) I can later swing **RIGHT** or **LEFT** as the board opens up, while still staying in the high\u2011score zone near the cluster of apples.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:** Move **DOWN** to (2,8). Watch the opponent\u2019s choice\u2014if they grab the apple at (5,8), I\u2019ll sprint right to claim (4,8) next turn. If they go left, I can pressure them from the side and aim to force a head\u2011on collision later when my apple count climbs.\n\nLet\u2019s do it.\n\nDOWN",

If he moves RIGHT into (3,9), he crashes into my body and DIES! That's a free kill for us if he's dumb! \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo his only safe moves are DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9).\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? \ud83e\udd14\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8) and he goes DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8) and he goes DOWN to (2,8) \u2192 adjacent, no collision.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8) and he goes LEFT to (1,9) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision (different y-level).\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 what if he goes DOWN to (2,8) and I go LEFT to (3,8)? We'd be adjacent at (3,8) and (2,8). That's fine, no crash.\n\nNO immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY: I have length 3, he has length 1. I want to BOX HIM IN and force him into a trap! He's on the top row with limited moves. If I can cut off his escape downward, he'll have nowhere to go.\n\nLOOK AT THE BOARD: Apple at (5,8) is RIGHT next to me. Eating it grows me to length 4, extends my lead to 3 apples vs 0. HUGE POWER SPIKE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nIf I go RIGHT and eat the apple, my head goes to (5,8), my body becomes [(4,8), (4,9), (3,9)]. That puts me horizontally between him and the right side of the board. He's at (2,9). If I then move UP next turn to (5,9)? That's risky because (5,9) is empty now, but my body will be at (4,8),(4,9),(3,9). Actually, (4,9) is my body, so (5,9) is safe next turn? Need to think ahead.\n\nBETTER PLAN: Eat the apple at (5,8), then next turn move UP to (5,9) if safe, putting me on the top row right next to him? He might be at (1,9) or (2,8) by then. Could set up a head-on if I have length advantage.\n\nBut also consider: If I go LEFT to (3,8), I'm moving toward him, cutting off his DOWN move. If he goes DOWN to (2,8), we're adjacent. Then next turn I could go UP to (3,9) \u2014 but that's my body! Actually (3,9) is my tail, so next turn if I move, my tail moves? Wait, if I don't eat an apple, my tail moves forward. So my body will shift. Need to simulate.\n\nSAFEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE: RIGHT to (5,8) to eat the apple, grow, and dominate the right side. That also keeps distance from him this turn, avoiding any accidental head-on while I'm bigger.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,7), I'm moving away from him and the apple \u2014 too passive. We're here to WIN, not to hide!\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), I'm moving closer but not growing. Could pressure him, but with my length 3 vs his 1, I'd rather grow and solidify my lead.\n\nCHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR! TAKE THE APPLE, EXTEND THE LEAD, AND USE MY LONG BODY TO WALL HIM OFF! He's already trapped near the top-left corner. After I eat, I can start encircling him.\n\nNEXT TURN PLAN: From (5,8), consider moving UP to (5,9) to block top row, or LEFT to (4,8) to squeeze him. Avoid moving into his potential path if he's coming down.\n\nRIGHT IS THE MOVE FOR GROWTH AND CONTROL! LET'S FEAST! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

The four squares I could slide into are:\n\n| Direction | Target cell | What's there? |\n|-----------|------------|---------------|\n| **UP**    | (2,\u202f9)     | Empty, but it\u2019s the top edge \u2013 I'd lose a lot of maneuver\u2011room. |\n| **DOWN**  | (2,\u202f7)     | Empty, still near the opponent but gives me a whole row of space below. |\n| **LEFT**  | (1,\u202f8)     | Empty, opens the whole left side of the board and keeps me away from the opponent\u2019s current corridor. |\n| **RIGHT** | (3,\u202f8)     | Empty, but it puts me right beside the opponent\u2019s body at (4,\u202f8). A little risky if they decide to swing **RIGHT** to (6,\u202f8) next turn. |\n\n**What\u2019s the opponent likely to do?** \ud83d\udc0d  \nTheir head is at (5,\u202f8) with body blocks at (4,\u202f8), (4,\u202f9) and (3,\u202f9). They can\u2019t move left into their own tail, so their safe choices are **UP** \u2192 (5,\u202f9), **DOWN** \u2192 (5,\u202f7) or **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,\u202f8). None of those squares clash with any of my options right now.\n\n**Goal:** stay alive, keep options open, and start hemming them in from the left side. Dropping to the very top edge (**UP**) would corner me; hugging the opponent\u2019s body (**RIGHT**) feels unsafe. Going **DOWN** is okay, but it still keeps me in the same vertical lane as the enemy, which might limit later \u201ccut\u2011off\u201d moves.\n\n**Best move:** **LEFT** to (1,\u202f8).  \n- It gives me a clear runway to the left wall and plenty of future directions.  \n- I stay out of the opponent\u2019s immediate path, avoiding any accidental head\u2011on.  \n- From (1,\u202f8) I can later swing **DOWN** or **UP** to chase apples or circle around the enemy\u2019s tail.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1. Move LEFT to (1,\u202f8).  \n2. Watch the rival\u2019s next direction. If they go **DOWN**, I\u2019ll follow with a **DOWN** to stay under them and pressure their tail.  \n3. If they go **UP** or **RIGHT**, I\u2019ll swing **UP** toward the top\u2011left corner and start boxing them from the side, looking for a chance to force a head\u2011on when my apple count surpasses theirs.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum and the pressure!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nLEFT",

LET'S GOOO! 3 apples vs 0)\n- ENEMY HEAD: (2, 8) \ud83d\udc79\n- ENEMY BODY: none (still length 1, he's WEAK)\n- BOARD: He's at (2,8), I'm at (5,8). I'm longer, I'm stronger, I'm in control.\n\nCHECK MY FOUR MOVES FROM (5,8):\n\nUP \u2192 (5, 9) \u2705 In bounds, empty cell '.' Safe.\nDOWN \u2192 (5, 7) \u2705 In bounds, empty cell '.' Safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (4, 8) \u274c That's my own body segment! Immediate crash \u2192 DEAD. NO.\nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 8) \u2705 In bounds, empty cell '.' Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNOW PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (2,8):\nHe can go UP \u2192 (2, 9) \u2705 Empty.\nDOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2705 Empty.\nLEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2705 Empty.\nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2705 Empty.\n\nAll four moves are safe for him right now. He has no body, so no self-collision risk.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? \ud83e\udd14\nIf I go UP to (5,9) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision (different rows).\nIf I go DOWN to (5,7) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8) and he goes RIGHT to (3,8) \u2192 no collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8) and he goes UP/DOWN/LEFT \u2192 no collision.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 what if he goes RIGHT to (3,8) and I go LEFT? I can't go LEFT, it's my body. So no head-on risk this turn.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY: I have length 4, he has length 1. I want to BOX HIM IN and force him into a trap! He's near the top-left corner. I want to cut off his escape routes and force him into my body or the wall.\n\nLOOK AT THE BOARD: Apples are scattered, but closest apple to me is at (7,4) \u2014 far away. Not worth chasing right now. Focus on ENCIRCLING THE ENEMY.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,9), I'm on the top row. That blocks him from moving right along the top if he goes up to (2,9). I can start building a wall above him.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,7), I'm moving away from him \u2014 too passive. We're here to DOMINATE!\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8), I'm moving sideways, not really pressuring him.\n\nBEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE: UP to (5,9). This accomplishes:\n1. Puts me on the top row, limiting his upward movement if he tries to go up.\n2. Next turn, I can move LEFT along the top row toward him, squeezing him against the left wall.\n3. My body at (4,9) and (3,9) is already on the top row \u2014 I'm creating a horizontal barrier.\n\nHe's at (2,8). If I go to (5,9), he might go UP to (2,9) or DOWN to (2,7). If he goes UP, he's trapped against the top wall with me to his right. If he goes DOWN, I can chase him down.\n\nCHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR! GO UP, TAKE THE HIGH GROUND, AND START THE BOX-IN! He has nowhere to run. With my length advantage, I can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on collision if needed \u2014 I'll win because I'm longer! \ud83d\ude08\n\nNEXT TURN PLAN: From (5,9), consider moving LEFT to (4,9) \u2014 but that's my body next turn? Wait, my tail will move, so (4,9) might become free? Actually, if I don't eat an apple, my tail at (3,9) will move forward? No \u2014 my tail only moves if I don't eat an apple. So my body will shift: new head at (5,9), then (5,8), (4,8), (4,9) \u2014 wait, need to simulate. Anyway, I'll have options to continue left or down to pressure.\n\nUP IS THE MOVE FOR PRESSURE AND CONTROL! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Moving **DOWN** gives us exactly that:  \n\n- Immediate safety (empty square).  \n- Keeps **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT** open for the next turn.  \n- Brings us two steps closer to the apple at (0,\u202f5).  \n- Keeps us out of any possible head\u2011on clash with the opponent.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n\n1. **DOWN** to (0,\u202f7).  \n2. On the next turn, continue **DOWN** toward (0,\u202f5) to grab that apple, then keep the momentum toward (0,\u202f0).  \n3. Meanwhile the opponent is stuck in the top\u2011right corner; we\u2019ll let them scramble while we grow and lock down the left side of the board.  \n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and keep the pressure!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nDOWN",

So he has 3 safe moves.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?\n- If I go DOWN to (6,8) and he goes RIGHT to (1,8) \u2192 no collision.\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,9) and he goes anywhere \u2192 no collision.\nSo no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\nBUT CHAT, WE GOTTA BE AGGRESSIVE! I have a 3-apple lead! I want to pressure him, cut off his space, and force him into a trap.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nFrom (6,9), if I go RIGHT to (7,9), I'm moving along the top edge away from him. That gives him room to breathe and maybe grab apples on the left. If I go DOWN to (6,8), I'm moving TOWARD the center and closer to him. With my length, I can start weaving left to cut the board in half and box him against the left wall. I want to dominate the center and top-mid area.\n\nAlso, check future options:\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,9), next turn from (7,9) I can go DOWN (7,8) or LEFT (6,9) (but that might be occupied by my body then? Let's simulate: after moving RIGHT, my new body: head (7,9), then (6,9), (5,9), (5,8) \u2192 tail (4,8) gone. So (6,9) will be my neck next turn, so LEFT would be unsafe next turn. So from (7,9) only DOWN and RIGHT might be safe? That could trap me along the top-right edge. Risky!\n\n- If I go DOWN to (6,8), next turn from (6,8) my body: head (6,8), then (6,9), (5,9), (5,8) \u2192 tail (4,8) gone. Then from (6,8) I could go LEFT (5,8) (my own body? Wait, (5,8) will be my tail segment at that start? Actually after moving, (5,8) becomes my fourth segment, so it's occupied. So LEFT would be unsafe. DOWN to (6,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,8) empty, UP to (6,9) my neck \u2014 unsafe. So from (6,8) I'd have DOWN and RIGHT safe. Similar branching.\n\nHMM... both give two safe moves next turn. But going DOWN puts me closer to apples at (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) and also closer to HIM. I can start moving left across rows 7 or 6 to cut him off from the right side of the board. He's short, so I can risk getting closer.\n\nAGGRESSION MODE: I want to pressure him while I have the length advantage. Going DOWN feels more proactive. Going RIGHT feels like running to the corner.

HE'S STUCK IN THE BOTTOM-LEFT CORNER! WE'RE BUILDING A WALL! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nGOING UP TO (3,7) MOVES AWAY FROM HIM, GIVES HIM BREATHING ROOM \u2014 NO!

WITH OUR LENGTH ADVANTAGE, WE CAN RISK A HEAD-ON SOON IF HE TRIES TO BREAK OUT!

Picking it up on the next turn will bring me level with the opponent (7\u202fsegments) and give me the momentum to start boxing him.\n2. **Opponent\u2019s likely move** \u2013 The foe can only go **UP** to (3,3) or **DOWN** to (3,1). Either way my upward move stays safe; they cannot chase me into (4,3).\n3. **Future mobility** \u2013 After reaching (4,4) I\u2019ll have open space upward and to the right, keeping multiple safe exits. Moving right now would delay the guaranteed apple and let the opponent keep the lead.\n4. **Board control** \u2013 By climbing the central column I can later swing right\u2011ward and trap the opponent against the left wall, turning my length advantage into a wall\u2011off.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f20:** **UP** \u2192 land on (4,3).  \n- **Turn\u202f21:** **UP** again to gobble the apple at (4,4).  \n- From there I\u2019ll decide whether to cut left\u2011ward or swing right into the apple cluster, using my newly\u2011grown body to seal the opponent\u2019s escape routes.\n\nLet\u2019s take the apple and start the squeeze!  \n\nUP",

BOTH ARE 2 MOVES!\n\nIF WE GO DOWN NOW TO (1,0), NEXT TURN WE CAN GO LEFT TO (0,0) AND EAT! \ud83c\udf4e BUT IS (1,0) SAFE NEXT TURN? LET'S CHECK POTENTIAL ENEMY MOVES! HE MIGHT MOVE TOWARD US? HE'S AT (5,4), CLOSEST APPLE TO HIM IS (7,4) EAST, (3,9) NORTH, OR (8,3) EAST-NORTH! HE'LL PROBABLY GO FOR AN APPLE AWAY FROM US! SO (1,0) SHOULD BE SAFE!\n\nIF WE GO LEFT NOW TO (0,1), NEXT TURN WE CAN GO DOWN TO (0,0) AND EAT! ALSO GOOD!\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT TO (2,1), WE MOVE AWAY FROM THE APPLE! THAT'S BAD! WE LOSE OUR CHANCE FOR A QUICK GROW! AND WE'RE JUST WANDERING! CHAT, WE'RE HUNGRY FOR THAT LEAD! \ud83d\ude80\n\nSO DOWN OR LEFT? WHICH IS BETTER? LET'S CHECK FUTURE OPTIONS AFTER EACH!\n\nGOING DOWN TO (1,0):\nNEXT TURN FROM (1,0) (AFTER EATING APPLE AT (0,0) IF WE GO LEFT NEXT):\nMOVES FROM (1,0): UP \u2192 (1,1) (WILL BE EMPTY AFTER WE MOVE), LEFT \u2192 (0,0) (APPLE, EAT!), DOWN \u2192 (1,-1) \u274c OFF BOARD! RIGHT \u2192 (2,0) \u274c ENEMY BODY! (2,0) IS SNAKE #0 TAIL! SO ONLY UP AND LEFT ARE SAFE! BUT AFTER EATING, OUR TAIL WILL GROW, SO (1,1) MIGHT BECOME OUR BODY? WAIT, WHEN WE EAT, WE GROW, SO OUR TAIL DOESN'T MOVE! OUR CURRENT TAIL IS (1,3)! SO (1,1) WILL BE EMPTY! SO FROM (1,0), UP AND LEFT ARE SAFE! THAT'S TWO OPTIONS! OKAY!\n\nGOING LEFT TO (0,1):\nNEXT TURN FROM (0,1) (BEFORE EATING APPLE):\nMOVES: UP \u2192 (0,2) '.' SAFE! DOWN \u2192 (0,0) APPLE! EAT! LEFT \u2192 (-1,1) \u274c OFF BOARD! RIGHT \u2192 (1,1) EMPTY! SO THREE SAFE MOVES! BETTER OPTIONS!\n\nSO LEFT GIVES MORE FUTURE OPTIONS AFTER REACHING THE APPLE! AND IT KEEPS US ON THE EDGE, WHICH CAN BE USED TO TRAP ENEMY LATER!\n\nALSO, GOING LEFT TO (0,1) PUTS US ON THE WEST WALL! ENEMY IS EAST! WE CAN START BOXING HIM IN FROM THE SIDE!\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: EAT APPLE AT (0,0) NEXT TURN, BECOME LENGTH 8 VS HIS 7! THEN USE LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO FORCE HEAD-ON COLLISIONS OR TRAP HIM AGAINST WALL! WE'LL HAVE THE WIN CONDITION! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSO CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR! WE GO LEFT TOWARD THE APPLE AND OUR FUTURE DOMINANCE! LEFT!\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE AT (0,0) TO GET LENGTH LEAD! NEXT TURN FROM (0,1), MOVE DOWN TO (0,0) TO EAT AND GROW TO 8! THEN USE LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO PUSH ENEMY! AVOID HEAD-ON UNTIL WE'RE LONGER! WATCH FOR ENEMY MOVING TOWARD CENTER!\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

ENEMY HEAD AT (6,4), BODY: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)] LENGTH 7! STILL TIED!\n\nAPPLE AT (0,0) IS RIGHT BELOW US! \ud83c\udf4e THAT'S OUR TICKET TO THE LEAD!

NICE!\n\nBUT CHAT, WE PLANNED TO GO DOWN TO EAT THAT APPLE! THAT'S THE PLAY! GET TO LENGTH 8, TAKE THE LEAD, THEN DOMINATE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nIS THERE ANY DANGER? ENEMY AT (6,4)! HE'S FAR AWAY! NO CHANCE FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION THIS TURN! HE CAN'T REACH (0,0) OR (0,1) IN ONE MOVE! SO DOWN IS SAFE!\n\nWHAT ABOUT UP OR RIGHT? IF WE GO UP, WE DELAY THE APPLE AND RISK HIM SNATCHING IT? NAH, HE'S TOO FAR! BUT WHY WAIT? WE NEED THAT GROWTH NOW! IF WE GO RIGHT BACK TO (1,1), WE'RE JUST LOOPING, WASTING TIME!\n\nGOING DOWN TO (0,0) EATS THE APPLE, WE GROW TO 8!

THAT KEEPS US ALONG THE WALL, BUT MOVES AWAY FROM THE APPLE!\n\nACTUALLY, THINK ABOUT THIS: IF WE GO DOWN AND EAT, WE GET THE LEAD IMMEDIATELY! EVEN IF WE ONLY HAVE ONE SAFE MOVE NEXT TURN, WE CAN SURVIVE! FROM (0,0) GO RIGHT TO (1,0)! THEN FROM (1,0) WE'LL HAVE OPTIONS! (1,0) IS SAFE NEXT TURN? CHECK ENEMY BODY: (4,0) IS HIS TAIL, BUT IT MIGHT MOVE? SNAKE #0'S TAIL IS AT (4,0), BUT HE MOVES EVERY TURN, SO HIS TAIL WILL MOVE NEXT TURN IF HE DOESN'T EAT! HE HAS NO APPLE NEARBY, SO HE PROBABLY WON'T EAT THIS TURN! SO (4,0) WILL BE EMPTY NEXT TURN! SO (1,0) SHOULD BE SAFE!\n\nSO GOING DOWN IS RISKY BUT DOABLE! WE GET THE LEAD! AND WITH LENGTH 8 VS 7, WE CAN FORCE HEAD-ON COLLISIONS TO WIN! THAT'S THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!\n\nWHAT'S THE ENEMY LIKELY TO DO? HE'S AT (6,4)! CLOSE APPLES: (7,4) EAST, (7,5) EAST-UP, (7,6) EAST-UP! HE'LL PROBABLY GO EAST OR NORTHEAST! AWAY FROM US! SO HE WON'T INTERFERE!\n\nCHAT, I SAY WE TAKE THE APPLE AND GET THE LEAD! BE AGGRESSIVE! WE CAME HERE TO WIN! DOWN TO (0,0)!\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE ATE THE APPLE AT (0,0)! NOW LENGTH 8 VS ENEMY 7! WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! NEXT TURN FROM (0,0), ONLY SAFE MOVE IS RIGHT TO (1,0)! THEN FROM (1,0), WE CAN GO UP TO (1,1) OR RIGHT TO (2,0) TO REGAIN OPTIONS! USE OUR LENGTH TO CUT OFF ENEMY'S SPACE AND FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN FAVORABLE! AVOID GETTING BOXED IN OURSELVES!

CHECK ENEMY BODY: ENEMY TAIL IS AT (4,0), BUT HE'S MOVING THIS TURN! HE'S NOT EATING AN APPLE THIS TURN? LET'S SEE APPLES NEAR HIM: (7,6), (7,5), (8,4), (8,7), (9,6), ETC. HE'S AT (7,4). HE COULD GO UP TO (7,5) FOR AN APPLE, OR RIGHT TO (8,4) FOR AN APPLE, OR DOWN TO (7,3) NO APPLE, OR LEFT TO (6,4) HIS OWN NECK. SO HE MIGHT EAT! IF HE EATS, HIS TAIL STAYS AT (4,0). IF HE DOESN'T EAT, HIS TAIL MOVES FORWARD. EITHER WAY, (1,0) IS NOT HIS BODY THIS TURN! SO RIGHT IS SAFE! \u2705\n\nSO ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: RIGHT TO (1,0)! WE PREDICTED THIS LAST TURN! NO CHOICE, CHAT! WE GOTTA GO RIGHT!\n\nBUT WAIT! WHAT ABOUT HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? ENEMY IS AT (7,4). HE CAN'T REACH (1,0) IN ONE MOVE! NO RISK! ALSO, NO OTHER SNAKES. SO RIGHT IS OUR ONLY PLAY!\n\nNOW, LONG-TERM PLAN! FROM (1,0) NEXT TURN, WE NEED TO REGAIN OPTIONS! POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (1,0): UP TO (1,1) (OUR OLD BODY? CHECK: AFTER WE MOVE RIGHT, OUR BODY WILL SHIFT: NEW BODY WILL BE HEAD AT (1,0), THEN OLD BODY FROM (0,0) BECOMES NECK? ACTUALLY, AFTER MOVING, OUR BODY LIST WILL BE: HEAD (1,0), THEN (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) \u2014 WAIT THAT'S 8 SEGMENTS INCLUDING HEAD. SO (1,1) IS PART OF OUR BODY! SO UP FROM (1,0) NEXT TURN WOULD BE INTO OUR OWN BODY! CAN'T! DOWN FROM (1,0) IS (1,-1) OFF BOARD! LEFT FROM (1,0) IS (0,0) OUR OWN BODY! RIGHT FROM (1,0) IS (2,0) EMPTY! SO NEXT TURN FROM (1,0) WE'LL ONLY HAVE RIGHT AS A SAFE MOVE AGAIN! \ud83d\ude33 CHAT, WE'RE IN A TUNNEL!\n\nWE NEED TO THINK AHEAD! AFTER RIGHT TO (1,0), THEN RIGHT AGAIN TO (2,0). FROM (2,0), OPTIONS OPEN UP: UP TO (2,1) (OUR BODY? CHECK FUTURE BODY: AFTER SECOND RIGHT, BODY: HEAD (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) \u2014 SO (2,1) IS BODY! CAN'T GO UP!), DOWN TO (2,-1) OFF BOARD, LEFT TO (1,0) BODY, RIGHT TO (3,0) EMPTY. SO AGAIN ONLY RIGHT! WE'RE TRAPPED ALONG THE BOTTOM WALL UNTIL WE HIT THE RIGHT SIDE OR OUR TAIL MOVES! THIS IS BAD!\n\nBUT OUR TAIL IS AT (1,2) CURRENTLY. AFTER WE MOVE RIGHT, TAIL STAYS AT (1,2) BECAUSE WE ATE LAST TURN, SO WE DON'T MOVE TAIL THIS TURN. NEXT TURN, IF WE DON'T EAT, TAIL MOVES TO (0,2)? ACTUALLY, TAIL MOVEMENT: EACH TURN WE MOVE HEAD, IF NO APPLE EATEN, TAIL SEGMENT IS REMOVED. OUR TAIL IS LAST IN LIST: (1,2). AFTER THIS TURN (MOVING RIGHT), WE DON'T EAT, SO TAIL (1,2) IS REMOVED. NEW TAIL BECOMES (2,2). SO AFTER THIS TURN, OUR BODY LENGTH STAYS 8, BUT TAIL MOVES FORWARD. THAT FREES UP (1,2) NEXT TURN! BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US AT (1,0) OR (2,0) DIRECTLY.\n\nWE NEED TO SURVIVE THIS TUNNEL! GO RIGHT TO (1,0) NOW, THEN NEXT TURN RIGHT TO (2,0), THEN RIGHT TO (3,0), ETC. EVENTUALLY WE'LL REACH (4,0) WHERE ENEMY'S TAIL WAS. BUT ENEMY'S TAIL WILL MOVE IF HE DOESN'T EAT. HE MIGHT EAT AN APPLE AND GROW, KEEPING HIS TAIL AT (4,0). WE NEED TO WATCH HIM!\n\nENEMY STRATEGY: HE HAS APPLES AT (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), ETC. HE'LL LIKELY GO TOWARD THEM. HE COULD GO UP TO (7,5) FOR APPLE, OR RIGHT TO (8,4) FOR APPLE. EITHER WAY, HE'S MOVING AWAY FROM US. GOOD!\n\nOUR GOAL: SURVIVE THE TUNNEL, THEN ONCE WE HAVE SPACE, USE OUR LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO BOX HIM IN! WE HAVE 8 SEGMENTS, HE HAS 7. WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION IF WE GET ADJACENT TO HIM AND WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! THAT'S AN INSTANT WIN! SO WE NEED TO MANEUVER TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES!\n\nFOR NOW, RIGHT IS THE ONLY MOVE! LET'S DO IT!\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE MOVING RIGHT TO (1,0)! WE'RE STUCK IN A BOTTOM-WALL TUNNEL FOR A FEW TURNS. NEXT TURN FROM (1,0), ONLY SAFE MOVE IS RIGHT TO (2,0). THEN RIGHT TO (3,0), ETC. WE MUST MONITOR ENEMY'S POSITION AND LENGTH. IF HE EATS, HE TIES LENGTH, AVOID HEAD-ON. IF HE DOESN'T EAT, WE KEEP ADVANTAGE. ONCE OUR TAIL MOVES ENOUGH, WE CAN TURN UP AT (4,0) OR (5,0) IF CLEAR. AIM TO MOVE TOWARD CENTER AND CUT OFF ENEMY'S SPACE. USE WALLS AND OUR BODY AS BARRIERS. STAY ALIVE!\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

BUT HE'S FAR, SO WE FOCUS ON OUR SURVIVAL.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: MOVE RIGHT ALONG BOTTOM TO (5,0), THEN TURN UP INTO THE OPEN AREA. FROM THERE, USE OUR LENGTH TO CUT OFF ENEMY'S SPACE. IF WE STILL HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE, SEEK HEAD-ON COLLISION OPPORTUNITIES. IF TIED, PLAY SAFE AND BOX HIM IN USING WALLS AND OUR BODY.\n\nFOR NOW, ONLY ONE MOVE: RIGHT! LET'S DO IT!\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE MOVING RIGHT TO (2,0)! STILL TRAPPED IN BOTTOM ROW. NEXT TURN FROM (2,0), ONLY SAFE MOVE WILL BE RIGHT TO (3,0). THEN RIGHT TO (4,0). AT (4,0) UP IS ENEMY BODY, SO MUST GO RIGHT TO (5,0). AT (5,0) WE CAN TURN UP TO (5,1) TO ESCAPE THE TUNNEL! ONCE FREE, AIM TO MOVE TOWARD CENTER AND USE LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO CUT OFF ENEMY. MONITOR ENEMY'S LENGTH: IF HE EATS THE APPLE AT (8,3), HE TIES US. AVOID HEAD-ON IF TIED. IF WE KEEP ADVANTAGE, LOOK FOR COLLISION CHANCE. STAY ALIVE!\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

ALSO, ENEMY HEAD AT (8,3) CAN'T REACH (3,0) IN ONE MOVE. SO RIGHT IS SAFE! \u2705\n\nSO AGAIN ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: RIGHT TO (3,0)! WE'RE STILL IN THE BOTTOM-WALL TUNNEL! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nBUT WAIT! ENEMY IS LONGER NOW! WE CAN'T RISK HEAD-ON COLLISION! WE MUST AVOID HIM AND SURVIVE! HE'S AT (8,3). APPLES NEAR HIM: (7,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,6), (8,2), (8,6), (7,7), (6,5). HE COULD GO MANY DIRECTIONS. FROM (8,3): UP (8,4) HIS NECK \u274c, DOWN (8,2) APPLE \u2705, LEFT (7,3) EMPTY \u2705, RIGHT (9,3) EMPTY \u2705. HE HAS OPTIONS! HE MIGHT GO DOWN TO (8,2) TO EAT AND GROW TO LENGTH 10! THAT'S BAD! BUT HE'S FAR AWAY, NO IMMEDIATE COLLISION RISK.\n\nOUR TUNNEL SITUATION: AFTER MOVING RIGHT TO (3,0), WE DON'T EAT AN APPLE (NO APPLE AT (3,0)), SO OUR TAIL MOVES! CURRENT TAIL IS (3,2). AFTER THIS MOVE, TAIL (3,2) IS REMOVED, NEW TAIL BECOMES (3,1). OUR BODY LENGTH STAYS 8. OUR NEW BODY WILL BE: HEAD (3,0), THEN (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). CHECK NEXT TURN FROM (3,0): UP (3,1) WILL BE OUR BODY! \u274c DOWN (3,-1) OFF BOARD \u274c LEFT (2,0) OUR BODY \u274c RIGHT (4,0) EMPTY? CHECK: (4,0) IS ENEMY BODY! ENEMY'S BODY HAS (4,0)! OH NO! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWAIT, ENEMY'S BODY LIST INCLUDES (4,0)! THAT'S HIS TAIL? LET'S SEE: HIS BODY: HEAD (8,3), THEN (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0). YES (4,0) IS HIS TAIL! BUT REMEMBER, SNAKES MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY! THIS TURN, HE WILL MOVE TOO! IF HE MOVES AND DOESN'T EAT, HIS TAIL (4,0) WILL BE REMOVED! SO (4,0) MIGHT BECOME EMPTY AFTER THIS TURN! BUT WE CAN'T RELY ON THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HIS MOVE! IF HE EATS, HIS TAIL STAYS, AND (4,0) REMAINS HIS BODY! SO RIGHT TO (4,0) COULD BE UNSAFE IF HE DOESN'T MOVE HIS TAIL! WE MUST ASSUME THE WORST! \n\nSO RIGHT MIGHT BE UNSAFE? LET'S CHECK: OUR MOVE IS SIMULTANEOUS WITH HIS. IF WE MOVE RIGHT TO (3,0), AND HE MOVES SOMEWHERE, HIS TAIL (4,0) MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MOVE. BUT THE RULE: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" THAT MEANS IF (4,0) IS PART OF HIS BODY AT THE MOMENT OUR MOVE IS RESOLVED, WE DIE. SINCE MOVES ARE SIMULTANEOUS, THE BOARD STATE FOR COLLISION CHECK IS THE STATE *BEFORE* ANY MOVES, BUT WITH THE NEW HEAD POSITIONS? LET'S THINK: THE GAME CHECKS COLLISIONS AFTER ALL HEADS HAVE MOVED. AT THAT POINT, BODIES ARE STILL THE OLD BODIES EXCEPT HEADS HAVE MOVED. TAILS ARE REMOVED ONLY AFTER COLLISION CHECK AND AFTER EATING CHECK. SO IF WE MOVE TO (4,0), AND (4,0) IS CURRENTLY HIS TAIL (IN THE OLD BODY), THEN OUR HEAD MOVES INTO HIS BODY \u2192 WE DIE! UNLESS HE ALSO MOVES HIS HEAD INTO (4,0)? THAT'S UNLIKELY. SO RIGHT TO (4,0) IS CURRENTLY INTO HIS BODY! THAT MEANS FROM (3,0), RIGHT IS NOT SAFE THIS TURN! BUT WE'RE AT (2,0) NOW, CONSIDERING MOVING TO (3,0). THAT'S FINE. BUT NEXT TURN FROM (3,0), RIGHT TO (4,0) MIGHT BE BLOCKED BY HIS TAIL UNLESS HE MOVES IT THIS TURN. SO WE NEED TO SEE IF HE'LL MOVE HIS TAIL THIS TURN.\n\nHE'S AT (8,3). IF HE MOVES AND DOESN'T EAT, HIS TAIL (4,0) WILL BE REMOVED. IF HE EATS, HIS TAIL STAYS. SO WE NEED TO GUESS HIS MOVE! HE HAS AN APPLE AT (8,2) DOWN FROM HIM. HE MIGHT GO DOWN TO EAT IT! IF HE DOES, HE GROWS, TAIL STAYS, (4,0) REMAINS. THAT'S BAD FOR US. IF HE MOVES LEFT TO (7,3) OR RIGHT TO (9,3) WITHOUT EATING, HIS TAIL MOVES, (4,0) BECOMES EMPTY. SO IT'S A GAMBLE!\n\nBUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GAMBLE! WE HAVE ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE RIGHT NOW: RIGHT TO (3,0). AFTER THAT, WE MIGHT BE TRAPPED IF (4,0) REMAINS HIS BODY! WE NEED AN ESCAPE PLAN!\n\nWAIT, IS THERE ANY OTHER POSSIBILITY? CAN WE GO ANY OTHER DIRECTION FROM (2,0)? NO, ONLY RIGHT IS SAFE. SO WE MUST MOVE RIGHT THIS TURN. THEN NEXT TURN FROM (3,0), WE'LL HAVE TO ASSESS AGAIN. HOPEFULLY HE MOVES HIS TAIL.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE'RE IN A BAD SPOT. ENEMY IS LONGER, WE'RE TRAPPED ALONG BOTTOM. WE NEED TO SURVIVE AND LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EAT APPLES TO CATCH UP. ONCE WE REACH (5,0) OR BEYOND, WE CAN TURN UP. BUT WE MUST GET PAST (4,0). IF (4,0) IS CLEAR NEXT TURN, WE CAN GO RIGHT TO (4,0). THEN AT (4,0), UP IS ENEMY BODY (4,1) UNLESS HE MOVES THAT TOO? (4,1) IS HIS BODY NOW, BUT IF HE MOVES AND DOESN'T EAT, (4,1) MIGHT BECOME HIS NEW TAIL? ACTUALLY HIS BODY ORDER: HEAD (8,3), THEN (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0). IF HE MOVES WITHOUT EATING, HIS TAIL (4,0) IS REMOVED, AND (4,1) BECOMES THE NEW TAIL? NO, THE BODY SHIFTS: NEW HEAD POSITION, THEN OLD HEAD BECOMES NECK, ETC., AND THE LAST SEGMENT (TAIL) IS REMOVED. SO (4,1) WILL STILL BE PART OF HIS BODY, JUST ONE CLOSER TO THE TAIL. SO (4,1) WILL LIKELY REMAIN HIS BODY NEXT TURN TOO. SO AT (4,0), UP TO (4,1) WILL STILL BE UNSAFE. SO WE MUST GO RIGHT AGAIN TO (5,0). AT (5,0), UP TO (5,1) SHOULD BE CLEAR! THAT'S OUR ESCAPE!\n\nSO PLAN: MOVE RIGHT THIS TURN TO (3,0). HOPE ENEMY MOVES WITHOUT EATING SO (4,0) CLEARS. NEXT TURN, IF (4,0) IS EMPTY, MOVE RIGHT TO (4,0). THEN NEXT TURN, MOVE RIGHT TO (5,0). THEN TURN UP TO (5,1) AND WE'RE FREE! IF AT ANY POINT (4,0) IS STILL ENEMY BODY, WE'RE STUCK AND DIE UNLESS HE MOVES LATER. BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE.\n\nWE MUST ALSO MONITOR ENEMY'S LENGTH. IF HE KEEPS EATING, HE'LL GET LONGER, MAKING IT HARDER TO BOX HIM. WE NEED APPLES! LOOK AT APPLE LIST: NEAR OUR FUTURE PATH: (6,1) IS AT (6,1) - ONCE WE'RE AT (5,1), WE CAN GO RIGHT TO (6,1) TO EAT! THAT'S A GOAL!\n\nFOR NOW, SURVIVE!\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE MOVING RIGHT TO (3,0)! STILL TRAPPED IN BOTTOM ROW. NEXT TURN FROM (3,0), CHECK IF (4,0) IS SAFE (ENEMY MAY HAVE MOVED TAIL). IF SAFE, GO RIGHT TO (4,0). IF NOT, WE'RE STUCK AND MAY DIE UNLESS ENEMY MOVES TAIL SOON. ONCE AT (4,0) OR (5,0), AIM TO TURN UP TO (5,1) TO ESCAPE TUNNEL. THEN TARGET APPLE AT (6,1) TO GROW AND CATCH UP IN LENGTH. ENEMY IS LONGER (9), AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISIONS. PLAY SAFE, SURVIVE, LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO CUT OFF HIS SPACE LATER.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

HE'S NOW 3 SEGMENTS LONGER THAN US! THAT'S BAD! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nNOW, CHECK OUR FOUR MOVES FROM (3,0):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,1) \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! (OUR NECK/TAIL REGION) CAN'T GO THERE!\nDOWN \u2192 (3,-1) \u274c OFF BOARD! CAN'T!\nLEFT \u2192 (2,0) \u274c OUR OWN BODY! (OUR PREVIOUS HEAD) CAN'T!\nRIGHT \u2192 (4,0) \u2753 IS IT SAFE? CHECK BOARD: CELL (4,0) IS 'T' \u2014 THAT'S ENEMY BODY! ENEMY'S BODY LIST INCLUDES (4,0) AS HIS TAIL! BUT WAIT, HE JUST ATE, SO HIS TAIL DID NOT MOVE! SO (4,0) IS STILL HIS BODY! IF WE MOVE RIGHT INTO (4,0), OUR HEAD MOVES INTO HIS BODY \u2192 WE DIE! \u274c\n\nOH NO! ALL FOUR MOVES ARE UNSAFE? \ud83d\ude31 THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT! LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK THE BOARD STATE: LOOK AT THE BOARD VISUAL:\n\nROW 0: \"T T T 1 T . . . . A\" \u2014 AT (4,0) IT'S 'T' (ENEMY TAIL). AT (3,0) IT'S '1' (OUR HEAD). SO RIGHT IS BLOCKED BY ENEMY TAIL. UP IS OUR BODY AT (3,1) (SHOWN AS 'T' ON ROW 1? ACTUALLY ROW 1: \"T T T T T . A . . A\" \u2014 AT (3,1) IT'S 'T' (OUR BODY). LEFT IS OUR BODY AT (2,0) ('T'). DOWN IS OFF BOARD.\n\nWE'RE TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude31 IS THERE ANY WAY OUT? WAIT, THE ENEMY MOVED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH US LAST TURN. HIS NEW HEAD IS (8,2). HIS TAIL (4,0) IS STILL THERE BECAUSE HE ATE. BUT MAYBE NEXT TURN HE WON'T EAT, AND HIS TAIL WILL MOVE? BUT WE NEED TO MOVE THIS TURN! WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVE! UNLESS... CAN WE RELY ON A HEAD-ON COLLISION? IF WE MOVE RIGHT INTO (4,0) AND HE ALSO MOVES HIS HEAD INTO (4,0)? IMPOSSIBLE, HE'S AT (8,2). CAN'T REACH (4,0) IN ONE MOVE. SO THAT'S SUICIDE.\n\nARE WE ACTUALLY DEAD? \ud83d\ude2d NO, WAIT! LET'S RE-EXAMINE THE ENEMY BODY LIST: \"Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0)]\" \u2014 THAT'S HIS OLD BODY FROM BEFORE HIS MOVE? THE GAME STATE SHOWS HIS CURRENT BODY AFTER HIS MOVE? IT SAYS \"OPPONENTS: * Snake #0 - Head: (8, 2), Body: [...]\" \u2014 THAT'S PROBABLY HIS BODY *AFTER* THE MOVE? BUT IF HE ATE, HIS BODY SHOULD BE LONGER: OLD BODY LENGTH 10, PLUS NEW HEAD (8,2), AND HE KEEPS THE TAIL (4,0). SO HIS NEW BODY SHOULD BE: HEAD (8,2), THEN (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0) \u2014 LENGTH 11. BUT THE LIST SHOWS ONLY 10 SEGMENTS STARTING WITH (8,3). THAT MEANS THE LIST IS STILL THE OLD BODY FROM LAST TURN? OR THEY LISTED IT WRONG? LET'S TRUST THE BOARD VISUAL: AT (4,0) IT'S 'T', SO IT'S STILL HIS BODY. SO RIGHT IS UNSAFE.\n\nBUT HOLD ON! IF HE ATE, HIS TAIL STAYS, SO (4,0) REMAINS. SO WE'RE STUCK. UNLESS... OUR OWN TAIL? OUR TAIL IS AT (3,1). AFTER WE MOVE, OUR TAIL WILL SHIFT IF WE DON'T EAT. BUT WE HAVE NO APPLE AT (3,0), SO IF WE MOVE, OUR TAIL (3,1) WILL BE REMOVED, MAKING (3,1) EMPTY NEXT TURN? BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US THIS TURN.\n\nWE NEED A MIRACLE! IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT (4,0) IS ACTUALLY EMPTY BECAUSE THE ENEMY'S TAIL MOVED? HE ATE, SO NO. UNLESS THE BOARD VISUAL IS FROM *BEFORE* THIS TURN? BUT THE TURN NUMBER IS 28, AND THIS IS THE STATE FOR TURN 28 DECISION. SO IT'S AFTER LAST MOVES RESOLVED. SO (4,0) IS SOLID ENEMY BODY.\n\nCHAT, WE MIGHT BE COOKED! \ud83d\ude2d BUT WAIT, LET'S CHECK THE ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (8,2). HE HAS APPLES NEARBY: (7,5), (7,6), (8,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,7), (6,5). FROM (8,2): UP (8,3) IS HIS NECK \u274c, DOWN (8,1) EMPTY \u2705, LEFT (7,2) EMPTY \u2705, RIGHT (9,2) EMPTY \u2705. HE HAS THREE SAFE MOVES. HE MIGHT NOT EAT THIS TURN. IF HE DOESN'T EAT, HIS TAIL (4,0) WILL BE REMOVED AT THE END OF THIS TURN! BUT COLLISION CHECK HAPPENS BEFORE TAIL REMOVAL! SO IF WE MOVE RIGHT INTO (4,0) THIS TURN, WE STILL DIE BECAUSE (4,0) IS STILL HIS BODY DURING COLLISION CHECK. SO NO ESCAPE.\n\nUNLESS... WE MOVE INTO A CELL THAT BECOMES EMPTY BECAUSE HIS TAIL MOVES? THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. COLLISION USES STATE BEFORE ANY TAIL REMOVALS.\n\nSO WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVE? THAT MEANS WE DIE THIS TURN NO MATTER WHAT? THAT CAN'T BE, THE GAME WOULDN'T GIVE US A TURN WITH NO LEGAL MOVES. LET'S TRIPLE-CHECK THE BOARD: MAYBE (3,1) IS NOT OUR BODY? OUR BODY LIST: HEAD (3,0), THEN (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). YES (3,1) IS OUR BODY. SO UP IS BLOCKED.\n\nLEFT (2,0) IS OUR BODY. DOWN OFF BOARD. RIGHT (4,0) ENEMY BODY. ALL BLOCKED. WE'RE DEAD UNLESS... CAN WE MOVE INTO OUR OWN TAIL IF THE TAIL MOVES? NO, COLLISION CHECK IS BEFORE TAIL REMOVAL. SO (3,1) IS SOLID.\n\nWAIT! IS (3,1) ACTUALLY OUR TAIL? OUR BODY LIST ENDS WITH (3,1). THAT'S THE TAIL. IF WE MOVE, THE TAIL WILL BE REMOVED AFTER COLLISION CHECK, BUT DURING COLLISION CHECK IT'S STILL THERE. SO UP IS STILL UNSAFE.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY TRAPPED AND WILL DIE THIS TURN. BUT THE GAME IS ASKING FOR A MOVE, SO MAYBE WE MISSED SOMETHING! LET'S LOOK AT THE BOARD VISUAL AGAIN: ROW 1: \"T T T T T . A . . A\" \u2014 AT (3,1) IT'S THE FOURTH 'T'? POSITIONS: (0,1)=T, (1,1)=T, (2,1)=T, (3,1)=T, (4,1)=T. (4,1) IS ALSO 'T' (ENEMY BODY). SO (3,1) IS OUR BODY, (4,1) ENEMY BODY.\n\nWHAT ABOUT (3,0) RIGHT? (4,0) IS 'T' ENEMY. SO NO.\n\nIS THERE ANY CHANCE (4,0) BECOMES SAFE BECAUSE ENEMY'S HEAD MOVES INTO IT? HE'S AT (8,2), CAN'T REACH (4,0). SO NO.\n\nWE'RE DEAD. BUT LET'S SUBMIT A MOVE ANYWAY? THE ONLY POSSIBILITY IS IF THE ENEMY'S BODY LIST IS INACCURATE AND (4,0) IS ACTUALLY EMPTY. BUT THE BOARD SHOWS 'T'. I'LL ASSUME RIGHT IS SUICIDE.\n\nSO WE HAVE NO SAFE MOVE. IN THAT CASE, WE PICK A MOVE THAT AT LEAST GOES OUT WITH A BANG? MAYBE RIGHT TO TRIGGER A HEAD-ON? BUT HE WON'T BE THERE.\n\nWAIT, LET'S CHECK IF ENEMY COULD MOVE INTO (4,0) VIA SOME WRAP? NO.\n\nHOLD ON! LET'S READ THE ENEMY BODY LIST CAREFULLY: \"Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0)]\" \u2014 THAT'S 10 COORDINATES. BUT HIS HEAD IS (8,2). SO THAT BODY LIST MUST BE FROM *BEFORE* HE MOVED, I.E., HIS OLD BODY POSITIONS AFTER HIS HEAD MOVED TO (8,2)? THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IF HIS HEAD IS NOW (8,2), AND HE ATE, HIS BODY SHOULD BE: (8,2) HEAD, THEN THE OLD BODY LIST PLUS THE OLD TAIL RETAINED. SO THE LIST SHOULD START WITH (8,3) AS NECK, THEN (8,4), ETC., AND END WITH (4,0). THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S SHOWN! SO (8,3) IS HIS NECK, NOT HIS HEAD. SO HIS CURRENT BODY IS: HEAD (8,2), NECK (8,3), ... TAIL (4,0). SO (4,0) IS INDEED HIS TAIL.\n\nOKAY, SO WE'RE TRAPPED. BUT MAYBE WE CAN MOVE UP INTO (3,1) IF OUR TAIL WILL MOVE? NO, COLLISION CHECK IS BEFORE TAIL REMOVAL. UNLESS... THE RULE SAYS \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" THAT INCLUDES YOUR OWN BODY. SO UP IS DEATH.\n\nTHEN WE HAVE NO LEGAL MOVE. THAT MEANS WE DIE NO MATTER WHAT. SO I'LL PICK RIGHT TO END IT QUICKLY. BUT LET'S THINK: IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT (4,0) IS ACTUALLY EMPTY BECAUSE THE ENEMY'S TAIL *WILL* MOVE THIS TURN? HE ATE LAST TURN, SO HE WON'T EAT THIS TURN UNLESS HE FINDS ANOTHER APPLE. HE MIGHT NOT. IF HE DOESN'T EAT THIS TURN, HIS TAIL (4,0) WILL BE REMOVED AT THE END OF THIS TURN, BUT DURING COLLISION CHECK IT'S STILL THERE. SO STILL UNSAFE.\n\nI'M GOING TO ASSUME THE GAME WOULDN'T PUT US IN A NO-WIN SCENARIO, SO MAYBE THE BOARD VISUAL IS MISLEADING. LET'S CHECK THE APPLE DROPS LIST: THERE'S AN APPLE AT (5,3), (6,1), ETC. NONE AT (3,0) OR (4,0). SO NO APPLE TO SAVE US.\n\nFINE, WE ROLL THE DICE! IF WE MUST DIE, LET'S DIE MOVING RIGHT INTO THE ENEMY'S TAIL, HOPING THAT MAYBE HE MOVES HIS HEAD INTO (4,0) VIA SOME MIRACLE? NO.\n\nACTUALLY, LET'S LOOK AT ENEMY'S POSITION: (8,2). HE HAS MANY OPTIONS. HE'S FAR. HE'S NOT A THREAT TO US DIRECTLY.\n\nI'M GOING TO CHOOSE RIGHT, ACCEPTING DEATH, BECAUSE ALL OTHER MOVES ARE ALSO DEATH. BUT LET'S FORMALLY LIST:\n\nUP: (3,1) OUR BODY \u2192 DEAD\nDOWN: OFF BOARD \u2192 DEAD\nLEFT: (2,0) OUR BODY \u2192 DEAD\nRIGHT: (4,0) ENEMY BODY \u2192 DEAD\n\nALL DEAD. SO I PICK RIGHT.\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE TRAPPED AT (3,0) WITH NO SAFE MOVES. ALL DIRECTIONS LEAD TO DEATH. UNLESS THE ENEMY'S TAIL (4,0) SOMEHOW BECOMES EMPTY BEFORE COLLISION CHECK (IMPOSSIBLE), WE DIE THIS TURN. OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT THE ENEMY'S BODY LIST IS OUTDATED AND (4,0) IS ACTUALLY EMPTY. BUT BOARD SHOWS 'T'. WE MOVE RIGHT AND PRAY FOR A MIRACLE. IF WE SURVIVE, NEXT TURN WE MUST ESCAPE THE BOTTOM ROW BY GOING UP TO (4,1) IF CLEAR, OR RIGHT TO (5,0). BUT LIKELY GAME OVER.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

WE CAN CIRCLE AROUND LEFT SIDE OF BOARD. ENEMY IS ON RIGHT SIDE. WE CAN BOX HIM LATER WHEN WE'RE LONGER.\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE MOVED RIGHT TO (5,0). NEXT TURN, FROM (5,0) CHECK UP (5,1) AND RIGHT (6,0). PREFER UP TO GET OFF BOTTOM ROW AND TOWARD APPLIES. ENEMY'S TAIL AT (4,1) MAY MOVE IF HE DOESN'T EAT, OPENING (4,1) FOR FUTURE. AVOID ENEMY'S BODY IN COLUMN 4. GROW BY TARGETING APPLIES AT (5,3) OR (6,1). STAY ALIVE AND CLOSE THE LENGTH GAP.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

COUNT: HEAD + 9 BODY = 10 TOTAL! YES WE GREW? NO, WE DIDN'T EAT LAST TURN! HMM LET'S RECALC: LAST TURN OUR BODY LENGTH WAS 9 (HEAD + 8). AFTER MOVING RIGHT WITHOUT EATING, WE SHOULD STILL BE 9! BUT LIST SHOWS 10 COORDS? LET'S CHECK GIVEN BODY LIST: [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)] \u2014 THAT'S 7 SEGMENTS AFTER HEAD? WAIT THAT LIST IS ONLY 7 COORDS, PLUS HEAD (5,0) = 8 TOTAL! YEAH WE'RE LENGTH 8! MY BAD! ENEMY LENGTH 11!

THAT MEANS HE GROWS TO LENGTH 12, HIS TAIL STAYS AT (4,1)? ACTUALLY IF HE EATS, HIS TAIL DOESN'T MOVE, SO (4,1) REMAINS ENEMY BODY! IF HE GOES UP INSTEAD, HIS TAIL MOVES TO (4,2) AND (4,1) BECOMES EMPTY! BUT HE PROBABLY WANTS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWE NEED TO GROW TOO! APPLES NEAR US: (5,3) TWO ABOVE! (6,1) UP-RIGHT!

BUT WHAT ABOUT FUTURE TRAPS? IF WE GO UP, WE'RE MOVING TOWARD COLUMN 5, WHICH IS RELATIVELY CLEAR!

GIVEN BODY: [(4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1)] \u2014 YES TAIL IS (1,1)! SO AFTER THIS MOVE WITHOUT EATING, TAIL (1,1) VANISHES, NEW TAIL BECOMES (0,1)! SO (5,0) BECOMES BODY, (4,0) BECOMES NECK, ETC. SO DOWN TO (5,0) WOULD BE OUR BODY NEXT TURN \u2014 BLOCKED! SO FROM (5,1), ONLY UP, RIGHT POSSIBLE (LEFT DEPENDS ON ENEMY TAIL). \n\nIF WE GO RIGHT TO (6,0): NEXT TURN FROM (6,0), MOVES: UP (6,1) APPLE, LEFT (5,0) OUR BODY, RIGHT (7,0) EMPTY, DOWN OFF BOARD. SO ONLY UP AND RIGHT SAFE! SIMILAR OPTIONS!\n\nBOTH GIVE US 2 SAFE FOLLOW-UPS! BUT UP GETS US OFF BOTTOM ROW AND CLOSER TO (5,3) APPLE! RIGHT KEEPS US LOW \u2014 MAYBE MORE OPEN SPACE ON RIGHT SIDE? BOARD RIGHT SIDE HAS ENEMY BODY ALONG COLUMN 4 AND TOP RIGHT APPLES! HMM!\n\nLONG-TERM: ENEMY WILL LIKELY EAT APPLE AT (9,1) AND GROW! WE NEED TO GROW FAST! TARGET (5,3) OR (6,1)! UP THEN UP THEN UP GETS (5,3) IN 3 TURNS! RIGHT THEN UP GETS (6,1) IN 2 TURNS! (6,1) IS CLOSER! BUT (5,3) IS MORE ISOLATED FROM ENEMY! ENEMY IS ON RIGHT EDGE, MAY CIRCLE BACK!\n\nALSO CONSIDER TRAPPING: IF WE GO UP, WE ENTER MID BOARD WITH MORE ROOM! IF WE GO RIGHT, WE STAY NEAR BOTTOM EDGE \u2014 RISK OF GETTING PINNED IF ENEMY COMES DOWN!\n\nENEMY'S NEXT MOVE: IF HE EATS AT (9,1), HIS HEAD GOES TO (9,1), LENGTH 12! HIS BODY EXTENDS, TAIL STAYS AT (4,1)! THAT BLOCKS (4,1) FOR US! SO LEFT FROM (5,1) REMAINS UNSAFE! BUT WE DON'T NEED LEFT!\n\nCHAT, I THINK UP IS BETTER! GETS US VERTICAL SPACE AND TOWARD APPLIES! RIGHT ALSO OK BUT DELAYS GROWTH! LET'S GO UP! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE MOVED UP TO (5,1). NEXT TURN, FROM (5,1) WE CAN GO UP TO (5,2) TOWARD APPLE AT (5,3) OR RIGHT TO (6,1) FOR APPLE THERE. ASSESS ENEMY'S POSITION: IF HE ATE AT (9,1), HE'S LONGER; AVOID HEAD-ON. FAVOR MOVES THAT KEEP US AWAY FROM ENEMY'S BODY IN COLUMN 4. IF POSSIBLE, COLLECT (6,1) APPLE SOON TO CLOSE LENGTH GAP. STAY AGGRESSIVE BUT SAFE!\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nUP",

BUT ENEMY STILL HAS 13 LENGTH, GAP WIDENS IF HE FINDS APPLES LATER.\n\nCHAT, THE APPLE AT (6,1) IS RIGHT THERE! WE CAN GRAB IT NOW AND START CATCHING UP! GROWTH IS CRUCIAL! ALSO, GOING RIGHT OPENS MORE SPACE ON THE RIGHT SIDE AWAY FROM ENEMY'S BODY WALL AT COLUMN 4. GOING UP KEEPS US NEAR THAT WALL AND LIMITS OPTIONS.\n\nCHECK FOLLOW-UP AFTER EATING AT (6,1): FROM (6,1), NEXT TURN MOVES: UP (6,2) EMPTY, LEFT (5,1) OUR BODY (BLOCKED), RIGHT (7,1) EMPTY, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c.

HE'S FAR, BUT STILL.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: EAT (6,1), THEN MOVE UP RIGHT SIDE COLLECTING APPLES, AVOID GETTING BOXED IN BY ENEMY'S LONG BODY. USE OUR GROWING LENGTH TO BLOCK HIM LATER.

NEXT TURN FROM (6,1), ASSESS ENEMY AT (8,0). HE'LL LIKELY GO UP TO (8,1) OR LEFT TO (7,0). WE SHOULD GO UP TO (6,2) TO CONTINUE UP RIGHT SIDE TOWARD CLUSTER OF APPLES, KEEPING DISTANCE FROM ENEMY BODY. AVOID MOVING LEFT INTO OUR BODY/ENEMY WALL.

GOOD!\n\nBUT FUTURE POSITIONING! LET'S ANALYZE:\n\nUP TO (4,4) \u2014 NO APPLE, LENGTH STAYS 11. NEXT TURN FROM (4,4): UP (4,5) EMPTY '.', DOWN (4,3) OUR PREVIOUS HEAD (WILL BE EMPTY AFTER WE MOVE? YES, BECAUSE WE DON'T GROW, TAIL MOVES), LEFT (3,4) EMPTY '.', RIGHT (5,4) ENEMY BODY \u274c. THREE SAFE OPTIONS! SOLID MOBILITY. ALSO MOVES US TOWARD APPLES AT (2,7), (3,8), (3,9) VIA NORTHWEST.\n\nLEFT TO (3,3) \u2014 NO APPLE, LENGTH STAYS 11. NEXT TURN FROM (3,3): UP (3,4) EMPTY '.', DOWN (3,2) EMPTY '.', LEFT (2,3) EMPTY '.', RIGHT (4,3) EMPTY (OUR OLD HEAD). FOUR SAFE OPTIONS! EVEN BETTER MOBILITY. BUT MOVES US AWAY FROM ENEMY AND APPLES CLUSTER IN TOP-RIGHT? APPLES AT (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7) ARE FAR. BUT WE HAVE APPLES AT (2,5), (2,7), (3,8), (3,9) CLOSER TO LEFT SIDE. LEFT GETS US CLOSER TO THOSE.\n\nDOWN TO (4,2) \u2014 IF SAFE, NO APPLE. NEXT TURN FROM (4,2): UP (4,3) EMPTY, DOWN (4,1) EMPTY '.', LEFT (3,2) EMPTY '.', RIGHT (5,2) OUR BODY \u274c. THREE SAFE OPTIONS. BUT DOWN IS RISKY PER BOARD 'T'. AVOID.\n\nCHAT, BOTH UP AND LEFT ARE GOOD. BUT CONSIDER ENEMY'S TRAJECTORY: HE'S FORCED LEFT TO (6,3). THAT PUTS HIM CLOSER TO APPLE AT (6,5)? APPLE AT (6,5) IS ON BOARD. HE MIGHT TURN UP NEXT TOWARD (6,4)? BUT (6,4) IS HIS BODY, SO HE CAN'T GO UP FROM (6,3) NEXT TURN? FROM (6,3), HIS OPTIONS NEXT TURN: UP (6,4) HIS BODY \u274c, DOWN (6,2) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (5,3) OUR BODY \u274c, RIGHT (7,3) HIS OLD HEAD (EMPTY). SO HE'D BE FORCED RIGHT BACK TO (7,3)? THAT'S A LOOP! HE COULD BE TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude32\n\nIF HE'S TRAPPED, WE CAN USE THAT TO BOX HIM IN! WE NEED TO GROW AND CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE. GOING UP TO (4,4) POSITIONS US TO MOVE TOWARD (3,4) THEN (2,5) APPLE, AND EVENTALLY ENCIRCLE HIM FROM THE NORTH. GOING LEFT TO (3,3) ALSO WORKS BUT MAY GIVE HIM SPACE.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: ENEMY IS ABOUT TO BE STUCK IN A CYCLE IF HE HAS NO GROWTH. WE NEED TO EAT APPLES SAFELY TO MATCH THEN EXCEED HIS LENGTH. ONCE WE'RE LONGER, WE FORCE HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN HE'S TRAPPED. NEXT TURN FROM (4,4) WE CAN GO UP TO (4,5) TOWARD APPLE AT (2,5) OR LEFT TO (3,4) TOWARD APPLE AT (3,8). KEEP FLEXIBILITY.\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE GOING UP TO (4,4) TO GAIN HIGH GROUND AND MAINTAIN MULTIPLE OPTIONS. ENEMY FORCED TO (6,3), WHICH MAY TRAP HIM NEXT TURN. MONITOR HIS LENGTH VS OURS. NEXT TURN FROM (4,4), PREFER MOVES TOWARD LEFT-SIDE APPLIES (2,5), (2,7), (3,8), (3,9) WHILE KEEPING ENEMY IN CHECK. IF HE REMAINS TRAPPED, WE CAN AGGRESSIVELY CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES AND FORCE A CRASH.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nUP",

After the move we\u2019ll have three viable exits (up, left, right) and stay away from the right wall.  \n*\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** \u2013 also gives an apple, but puts the head on the far\u2011right edge (x\u202f=\u202f9). Next turn we\u2019ll only have two safe directions (up or down) and risk a wall\u2011crash if we\u2019re not careful.  \n*\ufe0f\u20e3 **DOWN** \u2013 no apple now, but it puts us onto the tail\u2019s current tile (8,4) after the next move, keeping the board open. However we\u2019re giving up an easy point while the opponent is still lagging behind.\n\nSince we\u2019re already ahead (16\u202fvs\u202f12) and the opponent is on the opposite side of the board, **the best aggressive yet safe play is to grab the apple straight ahead**. It boosts our score, adds length for future boxing, and leaves us with plenty of maneuvering room.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **UP** to (8,7) and eat the apple.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn we\u2019ll eye the left\u2011side apple at (7,7) or the top\u2011right apple at (9,8), keeping the opponent scrambling on the left half of the arena.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue to hug the top\u2011right corner, using our growing tail as a wall to trap the rival when they try to swing over.\n\nLet\u2019s do it! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5  \n\nUP",

Both lead to apples, so I keep the score ticking while tightening my own \u201cwall\u201d on the far\u2011right side.  \n\n3. The rival is still stuck on the left half of the board. By hugging the right wall I\u2019ll start cutting off their escape routes and can later swing left\u2011ward to block any attempt they make to rush the center.\n\n4. No risk of head\u2011on collision this turn \u2013 the opponent is three columns away and can\u2019t reach (9,7) in one move.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f44**: **RIGHT** to (9,7).  \n- **Turn\u202f45**: take the apple at (9,8) (UP) or (9,6) (DOWN) depending on the opponent\u2019s move.  \n- Keep extending my right\u2011side wall, then loop left to squeeze the opponent into the cramped lower\u2011left corridor.\n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and snap that apple!  \n\n**RIGHT**",

No immediate clash, and we stay out of their growing shadow.  \n\n**Strategic vibe:**  \n- Grab that **(7,7)** apple on the following move, tightening the squeeze on the enemy\u2019s lower\u2011right side.  \n- Keep our snake \u201calive\u2011and\u2011kicking\u201d with plenty of escape routes, while the rival gets stuck polishing apples on the opposite side.  \n\nLet\u2019s hop down and keep the pressure rolling.  \n\nDOWN",

NO, SIMULTANEOUS MOVES, SO ONLY ONE STEP. SO NO DIRECT HEAD-ON AT (5,9) THIS TURN! \u2705\n\nBUT CHECK NEXT TURN: IF WE EAT APPLE AT (5,9), WE GROW TO LENGTH 17, HEAD AT (5,9).

HE MIGHT GO FOR AN APPLE!\n\nIF HE GOES UP TO (6,9), NEXT TURN WE'RE BOTH ADJACENT \u2014 POTENTIAL HEAD-ON AT (5,8) OR (6,9). IF HE GOES LEFT TO (5,8), SAME RISK. IF HE GOES DOWN TO (6,7), HE'S FARTHER.\n\nWE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO RIGHT AND EAT! WE MUST GROW TO CATCH UP! AFTER EATING, WE'LL HAVE TO NAVIGATE CAREFULLY NEXT TURN \u2014 MAYBE GO DOWN IF EMPTY, OR UP IF POSSIBLE? BUT UP IS OFF BOARD... HMM.\n\nLET'S THINK LONG-TERM: AFTER EATING, OUR LENGTH 17 VS HIS 20. WE NEED TO SURVIVE AND FIND MORE APPLES. APPLES LEFT: (0,8), (7,7), (7,9), (4,6), (5,4), (3,1), (1,1), (5,1), (7,0), (4,0), (0,0). WE CAN TARGET (7,7) OR (0,8) AFTER.\n\nNEXT TURN PLAN: FROM (5,9), CHECK SAFE MOVES BASED ON ENEMY'S NEW HEAD. IF ENEMY AT (6,9), OUR ONLY SAFE MOVE MIGHT BE DOWN (5,8) IF EMPTY \u2014 BUT IF HE'S AT (5,8), HEAD-ON! SO WE HOPE HE'S NOT THERE. IF ENEMY AT (5,8), OUR ONLY SAFE MOVE MIGHT BE RIGHT (6,9) IF EMPTY \u2014 SAME RISK. WE MIGHT BE FORCED INTO HEAD-ON IF HE'S ADJACENT AND MOVES INTO US. BUT HE HAS LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 WE LOSE! SO WE MUST PRAY HE GOES DOWN TO (6,7) THIS TURN! \ud83d\ude4f\n\nCHAT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT! IT'S OUR ONLY MOVE! WE EAT, WE GROW, AND WE FIGHT ANOTHER DAY! LET'S DO THIS! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'LL BE AT (5,9) WITH LENGTH 17. ENEMY LIKELY AT (6,9), (5,8), OR (6,7). IF ENEMY ADJACENT, AVOID HEAD-ON \u2014 MAYBE GO DOWN (5,8) IF EMPTY AND HE'S NOT THERE, OR RIGHT (6,9) IF EMPTY AND HE'S NOT THERE.

UP (5,9) OUR BODY? AFTER MOVING DOWN, OUR BODY: NEW HEAD (5,8), OLD HEAD (5,9) BECOMES NECK, SO (5,9) IS OUR BODY \u2014 MOVING UP IS BACKWARDS \u274c. DOWN (5,7) IS 'T' (TAIL) \u2014 DANGEROUS?

YES, AS ANALYZED. ENEMY CAN'T REACH (6,9) FROM (6,7) IN ONE MOVE.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: GO RIGHT TO (6,9). NEXT TURN, GO RIGHT TO (7,9) TO EAT APPLE AND GROW TO 18. ENEMY WILL BE AT (7,7) WITH 20 APPLES (LENGTH 21). WE THEN NEED TO ESCAPE FROM (7,9) \u2014 POSSIBLE MOVES: DOWN (7,8) (MAYBE ENEMY BODY?), LEFT (6,9) (OUR OLD BODY), UP (7,10) OFF BOARD, RIGHT (8,9) EMPTY? WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT!

LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'LL BE AT (6,9) WITH LENGTH 17. ENEMY LIKELY AT (7,7) WITH LENGTH 21. NEXT TURN, PLAN TO GO RIGHT TO (7,9) TO EAT APPLE IF SAFE! CHECK ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (7,7) TO AVOID HEAD-ON. IF RIGHT IS UNSAFE, LOOK FOR ALTERNATE EXITS \u2014 MAYBE DOWN (6,8) IF ENEMY BODY CLEARS? BUT LIKELY RIGHT IS OUR BEST SHOT.

HE'S LONGER BY 3 \u2014 DANGER! HE JUST ATE THAT APPLE AT (4,6) LAST TURN, SO HE GREW! LET'S SCAN OUR OPTIONS FROM (8,9):\n\nUP \u2192 (8,10) \u274c OFF BOARD! INSTANT DEATH!\nDOWN \u2192 (8,8) \u2753 BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! ENEMY'S BODY LIST HAS (8,8) AS A SEGMENT! MOVING DOWN IS INTO ENEMY BODY \u2014 DEATH! \u274c\nLEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2753 BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! (OUR NECK FROM LAST TURN) \u2014 MOVING LEFT IS BACKWARDS INTO OUR BODY \u2014 DEATH! \u274c\nRIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2753 BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705 POTENTIALLY SAFE!\n\nSO OUR ONLY POSSIBLE MOVE IS **RIGHT TO (9,9)**! BUT IS IT SAFE FROM ENEMY HEAD-ON COLLISION? WE GOTTA PREDICT WHERE ENEMY CAN GO FROM (4,6):\n\nENEMY AT (4,6) \u2014 POSSIBLE MOVES:\n- UP (4,7): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 HIS OWN BODY! (HIS BODY AT (5,7) etc) \u2014 WAIT, CHECK ENEMY BODY LIST: (5,7), (6,7), etc. (4,7) IS NOT LISTED, BUT BOARD SHOWS 'T' AT (4,7)? LOOK AT BOARD: ROW 7 COL 4 IS 'T' \u2014 THAT'S OUR BODY! (OUR BODY AT (4,7)? CHECK OUR BODY: WE HAVE (4,8), (4,7)? YES! (4,7) IS OUR BODY! SO ENEMY MOVING UP INTO (4,7) IS HITTING OUR BODY \u2014 HE DIES! WOULD HE DO THAT? MAYBE NOT, BUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY FOR HIM TO THROW! BUT FOR US, IT'S SAFE \u2014 HE DIES, WE WIN! BUT HE PROBABLY WON'T PICK THAT.\n- DOWN (4,5): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY! (OUR BODY AT (4,5)) \u2014 ENEMY MOVING DOWN INTO OUR BODY \u2014 HE DIES! AGAIN, SAFE FOR US.\n- LEFT (3,6): BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2014 EMPTY! \u2705\n- RIGHT (5,6): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 HIS OWN BODY! (HIS NECK AT (5,6) FROM LAST TURN? WAIT, HIS OLD HEAD WAS (5,6) LAST TURN, NOW HE MOVED TO (4,6), SO (5,6) IS NOW HIS BODY SEGMENT! YES, ENEMY BODY LIST SHOWS (5,6) AS FIRST BODY SEGMENT AFTER HEAD! SO MOVING RIGHT IS BACKWARDS INTO HIS BODY \u2014 DEATH FOR HIM! \u274c\n\nSO ENEMY'S SAFE MOVES ARE ONLY **LEFT TO (3,6)**! UP AND DOWN KILL HIM (HITTING OUR BODY), RIGHT KILLS HIM (HITTING HIS OWN BODY). SO HE **HAS TO GO LEFT TO (3,6)** TO SURVIVE! CHAT, THAT'S HUGE! WE CAN PREDICT HIS MOVE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nNOW, WILL OUR MOVE TO (9,9) COLLIDE WITH HIS MOVE TO (3,6)? NO, DIFFERENT CELLS. SO RIGHT IS SAFE FROM HEAD-ON!\n\nBUT NEXT TURN FROM (9,9): OUR OPTIONS WILL BE:\n- UP (9,10) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n- DOWN (9,8) \u2753 BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! (ENEMY HAS (9,8)) \u2014 DANGEROUS!\n- LEFT (8,9) \u2753 WILL BE OUR BODY (OUR OLD HEAD) \u2014 CAN'T GO BACK!\n- RIGHT (10,9) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n\nSO FROM (9,9) NEXT TURN, **ALL MOVES ARE UNSAFE** UNLESS ENEMY'S TAIL MOVES AND CLEARS (9,8) OR OUR TAIL MOVES AND CLEARS (8,9)? LET'S CHECK TAILS: OUR TAIL IS AT (5,3) \u2014 FAR. ENEMY TAIL IS AT (8,0) \u2014 ALSO FAR. ENEMY MOVING TO (3,6) WILL SHIFT HIS BODY, BUT HIS SEGMENT AT (9,8) WON'T MOVE YET BECAUSE HE'S LONG (21). SO (9,8) STAYS ENEMY BODY NEXT TURN! WE'D BE TRAPPED AT (9,9) AND DIE! \ud83d\ude31\n\nSO RIGHT TO (9,9) IS A **SUICIDE TRAP** FOR NEXT TURN! BUT IT'S OUR ONLY LEGAL MOVE THIS TURN! UNLESS... WAIT, DID WE MISS ANY POSSIBILITY? CHECK AGAIN: FROM (8,9), DOWN IS (8,8) \u2014 ENEMY BODY, BUT IF ENEMY MOVES HIS HEAD, DOES HIS BODY AT (8,8) BECOME EMPTY? NO, BECAUSE SNAKE BODIES MOVE ONLY WHEN THE HEAD MOVES, AND THE TAIL SHRINKS UNLESS HE EATS AN APPLE. HE JUST ATE AN APPLE AT (4,6), SO HE **GROWS** THIS TURN! THAT MEANS HIS BODY LENGTH INCREASES BY 1, SO HIS **TAIL DOES NOT MOVE**! SO ALL HIS BODY CELLS STAY! SO (8,8) REMAINS ENEMY BODY THIS TURN AND NEXT TURN! SO DOWN IS STILL DEATH!\n\nLEFT IS OUR BODY \u2014 ALSO DEATH. UP OFF BOARD. SO ONLY RIGHT.\n\nWE'RE FORCED INTO (9,9) AND THEN LIKELY DEAD NEXT TURN UNLESS A MIRACLE! BUT WAIT \u2014 ENEMY IS FORCED LEFT TO (3,6). CAN WE USE THAT? MAYBE WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION IF WE SOMEHOW GET TO (3,6)?? IMPOSSIBLE FROM HERE.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE TOP RIGHT CORNER! THE ONLY HOPE IS THAT ENEMY'S BODY AT (9,8) OR (8,8) CLEARS **BEFORE** WE GET TRAPPED. BUT HIS TAIL IS AT (8,0), SO IT'LL TAKE MANY TURNS. WE'RE DEAD UNLESS WE FIND ANOTHER PATH? LOOK AT BOARD \u2014 WHAT IF WE GO RIGHT TO (9,9), THEN NEXT TURN WE GO DOWN INTO (9,8) **IF** ENEMY'S BODY THERE CLEARS? IT WON'T. SO WE'RE COOKED.\n\nUNLESS... CHAT, BIG BRAIN TIME: ENEMY IS FORCED LEFT TO (3,6). THAT MEANS HIS HEAD IS MOVING AWAY FROM US. MAYBE WE CAN JUMP OFF THE BOARD? NO, THAT'S DEATH. BUT WHAT IF WE GO RIGHT TO (9,9) AND HOPE ENEMY ACCIDENTALLY GOES UP OR DOWN AND DIES? HE WON'T \u2014 HE'S FORCED LEFT TO SURVIVE. SO HE SURVIVES.\n\nWE NEED A MIRACLE. BUT WE MUST MOVE. SO WE GO RIGHT AND PRAY HIS TAIL MOVES SOMEHOW NEXT TURN? ACTUALLY, HE ATE AN APPLE, SO HIS TAIL STAYS. SO NO.\n\nWAIT \u2014 RULE CHECK: WHEN HE EATS AN APPLE, HE GROWS, SO HIS TAIL **DOES NOT MOVE** THAT TURN. NEXT TURN, IF HE DOESN'T EAT, HIS TAIL WILL MOVE. SO **NEXT TURN** HIS TAIL AT (8,0) WILL MOVE TO (7,0)? BUT (9,8) IS FAR FROM TAIL, SO (9,8) WON'T CLEAR NEXT TURN EITHER. WE'RE STILL TRAPPED.\n\nOKAY, WE'RE PROBABLY DEAD NEXT TURN. BUT LET'S GO OUT FIGHTING! RIGHT TO (9,9) AND HOPE ENEMY MAKES A MISTAKE IN FUTURE TURNS? OR MAYBE WE CAN FORCE A DRAW BY HEAD-ON? NOT POSSIBLE.\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'LL BE AT (9,9) WITH NO SAFE MOVES NEXT TURN UNLESS ENEMY'S BODY AT (9,8) MAGICALLY CLEARS (IT WON'T). OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT ENEMY DIES THIS TURN BY ACCIDENT (HE WON'T) OR THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW TELEPORT? NOPE. WE'RE LIKELY ENDING NEXT TURN. BUT IF BY SOME MIRACLE (9,8) BECOMES EMPTY, WE GO DOWN. OTHERWISE, WE'RE DEAD. FOCUS ON FORCING ENEMY INTO A TRAP IN HIS FUTURE MOVES? HE'S AT (3,6) NEXT, HEADING WEST. WE CAN'T REACH HIM. OUR BEST BET IS TO ACCEPT FATE AND MOVE RIGHT, HOPING FOR A MISTAKE OR A TAIL CLEARANCE SOON. MAYBE ENEMY WILL EAT ANOTHER APPLE AND NOT MOVE TAIL FOR LONGER? UGH. WE NEED TO SURVIVE ONE MORE TURN TO SEE IF ANYTHING CHANGES. GO RIGHT.\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

BUT NOW WE'RE IN THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER WITH ENEMY BODY BELOW US AT (9,8) AND OUR OWN BODY TO THE LEFT AT (8,9) \u2014 WE'RE TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude31\n\nLET'S CHECK OUR OPTIONS FROM HEAD (9,9):\n\n- **UP (9,10)**: \u274c OFF BOARD! INSTANT DEATH!\n- **DOWN (9,8)**: BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY! SNAKE #0 HAS (9,8) IN HIS BODY LIST! MOVING DOWN IS INTO ENEMY BODY \u2014 WE DIE! \u274c\n- **LEFT (8,9)**: BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! (OUR NECK FROM LAST TURN) \u2014 MOVING LEFT IS BACKWARDS INTO OUR BODY \u2014 DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (10,9)**: \u274c OFF BOARD! INSTANT DEATH!\n\nOH NO! ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE **IMMEDIATELY LETHAL** THIS TURN! \ud83d\ude2d ARE WE ACTUALLY DEAD? WAIT \u2014 LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK THE RULES: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" YES. SO FROM (9,9) WE HAVE **ZERO SAFE MOVES**! IS THAT POSSIBLE? DID WE JUST LOSE LAST TURN? NO, WE'RE STILL ALIVE, SO MAYBE THE BOARD STATE HAS CHANGED BECAUSE THE ENEMY MOVED SIMULTANEOUSLY! REMEMBER, SNAKES MOVE AT THE SAME TIME! LAST TURN WE PREDICTED ENEMY WOULD GO LEFT TO (3,6) TO SURVIVE. IF HE DID, HIS BODY WOULD SHIFT FORWARD, AND HIS **TAIL MIGHT MOVE** IF HE DIDN'T EAT AN APPLE THIS TURN! DID HE EAT AN APPLE AT (3,6)? LOOK AT APPLE DROPS LIST \u2014 (3,6) IS NOT AN APPLE! SO HE **DID NOT EAT** THIS TURN! THAT MEANS HIS TAIL **MOVES**! HIS TAIL WAS AT (8,1) LAST TURN? CHECK OPPONENT BODY: LAST TURN HIS TAIL WAS (8,1)? ACTUALLY HIS BODY LIST ENDED WITH (8,1). SO AFTER MOVING LEFT TO (3,6) WITHOUT EATING, HIS TAIL CELL (8,1) BECOMES EMPTY! BUT DOES THAT AFFECT (9,8)? NO, (9,8) IS FAR FROM HIS TAIL. (9,8) IS HIS BODY SEGMENT NEAR HIS HEAD. WHEN HE MOVES, HIS ENTIRE BODY SHIFTS FORWARD \u2014 SO THE SEGMENT AT (9,8) MOVES TO WHERE HIS HEAD WAS? LET'S TRACE: HIS OLD HEAD WAS (4,6), HE MOVED LEFT TO (3,6). HIS BODY SEGMENTS SHIFT: THE OLD HEAD (4,6) BECOMES NEW NECK, ETC. THE SEGMENT AT (9,8) IS PART OF HIS BODY NEAR THE MIDDLE. AFTER SHIFTING, (9,8) MIGHT BECOME (8,8) OR SOMETHING? WAIT, LET'S RECONSTRUCT ENEMY'S NEW BODY AFTER MOVING LEFT WITHOUT EATING:\n\nOLD BODY (from last turn): Head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1) [tail].\n\nAFTER MOVING HEAD LEFT TO (3,6):\n- New head: (3,6)\n- New body[0]: old head (4,6)\n- New body[1]: old body[0] (5,6)\n- New body[2]: (5,7)\n- New body[3]: (6,7)\n- New body[4]: (6,8)\n- New body[5]: (7,8)\n- New body[6]: (8,8)\n- New body[7]: (9,8)  \u2190 THIS SEGMENT SHIFTS TO (8,8)? NO, LET'S LIST PROPERLY:\n\nActually, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n- Segment at (5,6) moves to (4,6)\n- Segment at (5,7) moves to (5,6)\n- Segment at (6,7) moves to (5,7)\n- Segment at (6,8) moves to (6,7)\n- Segment at (7,8) moves to (6,8)\n- Segment at (8,8) moves to (7,8)\n- Segment at (9,8) moves to (8,8)  \u2190 YES! (9,8) BECOMES EMPTY BECAUSE THAT SEGMENT MOVED TO (8,8)!\n- Segment at (9,7) moves to (9,8)\n- Segment at (8,7) moves to (9,7)\n- etc.\n\nSO (9,8) IS NO LONGER ENEMY BODY AFTER THE SHIFT! IT BECOMES THE POSITION OF THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (9,7), WHICH IS ENEMY BODY, BUT THAT SEGMENT MOVED TO (9,8)? WAIT, CHECK: THE SEGMENT AT (9,7) MOVES TO (9,8)? LET'S TRACE CAREFULLY:\n\nOLD order after head (4,6): [ (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,6), each body segment advances:\n- New body[0] = old head (4,6)\n- New body[1] = old body[0] (5,6)\n- New body[2] = old body[1] (5,7)\n- New body[3] = old body[2] (6,7)\n- New body[4] = old body[3] (6,8)\n- New body[5] = old body[4] (7,8)\n- New body[6] = old body[5] (8,8)\n- New body[7] = old body[6] (9,8)  \u2190 this segment moves to (8,8)? No, it moves to the position of the previous segment? Actually, each segment takes the position of the segment ahead of it? Wait, standard snake movement: the body follows the head; each segment moves into the previous segment's position. So the segment at (5,6) moves to where the head was (4,6). The segment at (5,7) moves to (5,6). The segment at (6,7) moves to (5,7). The segment at (6,8) moves to (6,7). The segment at (7,8) moves to (6,8). The segment at (8,8) moves to (7,8). The segment at (9,8) moves to (8,8). The segment at (9,7) moves to (9,8). YES! So (9,8) becomes occupied by the segment that was at (9,7)! So (9,8) is **STILL ENEMY BODY** after the shift! Because the enemy segment from (9,7) moves into (9,8)! So DOWN IS STILL DEATH! \ud83d\ude2b\n\nBUT HOLD UP \u2014 THE ENEMY'S TAIL (8,1) IS REMOVED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T EAT. SO (8,1) BECOMES EMPTY. BUT (9,8) REMAINS ENEMY BODY.\n\nSO WE'RE STILL TRAPPED! UNLESS... OUR OWN BODY AT (8,9) SHIFTS? WE DIDN'T EAT AN APPLE LAST TURN (WE MOVED TO (9,9), NO APPLE THERE), SO OUR TAIL MOVES! OUR TAIL WAS AT (4,3) LAST TURN? CHECK OUR BODY LIST: last element (4,3) was tail. AFTER MOVING TO (9,9) WITHOUT EATING, OUR BODY SHIFTS: OUR OLD HEAD (8,9) BECOMES NEW NECK, SO (8,9) IS STILL OUR BODY! SO LEFT IS STILL DEATH.\n\nWE ARE **STILL TRAPPED** WITH NO SAFE MOVES! \ud83d\ude31 IS THIS THE END? WAIT \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT MEANS COLLISIONS ARE CHECKED **AFTER** MOVEMENT. SO IF WE MOVE DOWN INTO (9,8) AND ENEMY'S BODY MOVES OUT OF (9,8) AT THE SAME TIME, IS IT EMPTY? NO, AS ABOVE, ENEMY'S BODY MOVES INTO (9,8) FROM (9,7). SO (9,8) IS STILL OCCUPIED BY ENEMY BODY **AFTER** THE MOVEMENT. SO WE DIE.\n\nBUT WHAT IF WE MOVE LEFT INTO (8,9) AND OUR BODY MOVES OUT? OUR BODY AT (8,9) SHIFTS TO (7,9)? LET'S CHECK OUR BODY SHIFT: OUR OLD BODY: Head (9,9), then (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), ... AFTER MOVING (LET'S SAY WE MOVE DOWN TO (9,8) \u2014 BUT THAT'S INTO ENEMY BODY, SO NOT ALLOWED). ACTUALLY, LET'S CALCULATE FOR ANY MOVE:\n\nIF WE MOVE DOWN TO (9,8):\n- New head: (9,8)\n- New body[0]: old head (9,9)\n- New body[1]: old body[0] (8,9)\n- New body[2]: (7,9)\n- etc.\nSo (8,9) becomes occupied by old head (9,9)? Wait, no \u2014 the segment that was at (8,9) moves to (9,9)? Actually, each body segment moves into the position of the previous segment. So the segment at (8,9) moves to (9,9) (the old head position). So (8,9) becomes occupied by the segment that was at (7,9)? Let's not overcomplicate \u2014 the key is: at the time of collision check, are we moving into a cell that will be occupied by any snake's body after all snakes have moved? The game likely checks **post-movement** positions. So we need to know if (9,8) will be empty after enemy movement. From above, (9,8) will contain enemy's body segment from (9,7). So NOT empty. So DOWN kills us.\n\nIF WE MOVE LEFT TO (8,9):\n- New head: (8,9)\n- New body[0]: old head (9,9)\n- New body[1]: old body[0] (8,9) \u2192 but (8,9) is now the head? Wait, that's a problem: moving left puts our head into a cell that is currently our body (8,9). At the moment of movement, that cell is occupied by our own body. Even if that body segment moves away simultaneously, the rule \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" This is exactly backwards movement? From (9,9) to (8,9) is left, which is backwards relative to our previous move (last move we went right from (8,9) to (9,9)). So moving left is moving backwards into the cell we just left, which is now our neck. That's explicitly forbidden: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" So LEFT is death regardless of shifting.\n\nSO WE HAVE NO LEGAL MOVE! \ud83d\ude2d CHAT, IS THIS A SUDDEN DEATH? WE MUST PICK A MOVE, BUT ALL KILL US. THEN WE DIE THIS TURN. BUT MAYBE ENEMY ALSO HAS NO SAFE MOVE? LET'S CHECK ENEMY'S POSITION NOW: HIS HEAD IS AT (3,6) AFTER MOVING LEFT. FROM (3,6), HIS OPTIONS:\n- UP (3,7): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY! (WE HAVE (3,7) IN OUR BODY LIST) \u2014 HE DIES IF HE GOES UP.\n- DOWN (3,5): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY! (WE HAVE (3,5)) \u2014 HE DIES.\n- LEFT (2,6): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY! (WE HAVE (2,6)? CHECK OUR BODY: (2,7), (2,6), (2,5) \u2014 YES, (2,6) IS OUR BODY!) \u2014 HE DIES.\n- RIGHT (4,6): BOARD SHOWS 'T' \u2014 HIS OWN BODY! (HIS NEW NECK AFTER MOVING LEFT) \u2014 HE DIES.\n\nOMG! ENEMY ALSO HAS **ZERO SAFE MOVES** FROM (3,6)! \ud83d\ude31 HE'S SURROUNDED BY OUR BODY AND HIS OWN BODY! SO BOTH OF US HAVE NO SAFE MOVES THIS TURN! THAT MEANS **WE BOTH DIE THIS TURN**! THEN GAME ENDS IMMEDIATELY! SCORE: WE HAVE 17 APPLES, ENEMY HAS 20 APPLES. ENEMY WINS! \ud83d\ude2b\n\nUNLESS... CAN WE FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION TO TIE? IF WE BOTH MOVE INTO THE SAME CELL, BOTH DIE, BUT THEN GAME ENDS WITH ENEMY HAVING MORE APPLES, SO HE STILL WINS. WE NEED A MIRACLE TO SURVIVE.\n\nWAIT \u2014 IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT ONE OF OUR MOVES IS ACTUALLY SAFE DUE TO SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT CLEARING THE CELL? LET'S EXAMINE DOWN (9,8) MORE CLOSELY: ENEMY'S BODY AT (9,8) SHIFTS TO (8,8). BUT WE SAID THE SEGMENT AT (9,7) SHIFTS TO (9,8). SO (9,8) BECOMES ENEMY BODY. SO NO.\n\nWHAT ABOUT UP OR RIGHT? OFF BOARD \u2014 NO.\n\nWE'RE DEAD. BUT THE GAME REQUIRES US TO PICK A MOVE. IF WE'RE GOING TO DIE ANYWAY, LET'S AT LEAST TRY TO KILL THE ENEMY TOO! CAN WE MOVE IN A WAY THAT CAUSES A HEAD-ON COLLISION? ENEMY IS AT (3,6), WE'RE AT (9,9) \u2014 TOO FAR. IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nSO WE LOSE. UNLESS... THE BOARD STATE SHOWN IS **BEFORE** THIS TURN'S MOVEMENTS? YES! THE BOARD STATE IS THE STATE AT THE **START** OF TURN 53! WE JUST MOVED LAST TURN, AND THE BOARD IS UPDATED FOR TURN 53? ACTUALLY, THE \"YOUR LAST MOVE\" SECTION SHOWS WE MOVED RIGHT LAST TURN (TURN 52). NOW WE'RE AT TURN 53, AND THE BOARD STATE SHOWN IS **AFTER** TURN 52 MOVEMENTS? LET'S READ: \"Turn: 53 / 150\" \u2014 THIS IS THE STATE **BEFORE** WE MAKE OUR MOVE FOR TURN 53! SO THE BOARD SHOWS POSITIONS AFTER TURN 52. THAT MEANS ENEMY'S HEAD IS AT (3,6) **ALREADY** (HE MOVED LEFT LAST TURN). AND OUR HEAD IS AT (9,9). SO THE TRAPPED SITUATION IS **CURRENT**. WE HAVE TO MOVE NOW.\n\nBUT ENEMY'S BODY LIST SHOWN IS HIS BODY **BEFORE** TURN 53? IT SAYS \"OPPONENTS: Snake #0 - Head: (3,6), Body: [...]\" THAT'S HIS CURRENT BODY AT THE START OF TURN 53. SO HE HAS ALREADY MOVED LEFT TO (3,6), AND HIS BODY HAS SHIFTED ACCORDINGLY. LET'S CHECK HIS BODY LIST: IT STARTS WITH (4,6) AS FIRST BODY SEGMENT (HIS OLD HEAD). THAT MATCHES THE SHIFT. SO (9,8) IS STILL IN HIS BODY LIST? LOOK: HIS BODY LIST INCLUDES (9,8)? SCAN: ... (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), ... YES! (9,8) IS STILL THERE! SO DOWN IS STILL ENEMY BODY.\n\nWE'RE DEAD. BUT LET'S PICK A MOVE THAT AT LEAST GOES OUT FIGHTING! IF WE MOVE DOWN, WE DIE BUT MAYBE ENEMY ALSO DIES IF HE MOVES INTO US? HE WON'T. SO NO.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE LOST. BUT THE SHOW MUST GO ON! WE PICK **DOWN** AND MEET OUR FATE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**START NEXT TURN PLAN**\nWE'RE LIKELY DEAD. IF BY SOME MIRACLE DOWN IS SAFE BECAUSE ENEMY'S BODY MOVES OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY (UNLIKELY), WE SURVIVE. OTHERWISE, GG. ENEMY IS ALSO TRAPPED AT (3,6) WITH NO SAFE MOVES, SO HE DIES TOO! IF WE BOTH DIE, GAME ENDS AND ENEMY WINS 20-17. WE NEED A MIRACLE \u2014 MAYBE HE MOVES INTO OUR BODY AND DIES WHILE WE SURVIVE? BUT WE'RE MOVING DOWN, NOT INTO HIM. SO NO. ACCEPT DEFEAT AND GO DOWN FIGHTING!\n**END NEXT TURN PLAN**\n\nDOWN",
