It seems like a good balance between scoring points and staying safe.\n* **Right (Increase x by 1) - (6, 1):** This move also puts me near an apple but places me closer to the enemy snake's path. This might be risky.\n* **Up (Decrease y by 1) - (5, 0):** This move takes me to an empty space, further reducing the chances of an immediate collision with an enemy snake. However, it doesn't help me eat an apple.\n* **Down (Increase y by 1) - (5, 2):** This move doesn't bring me closer to an apple either.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT. \n\nUP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT: LEFT",
