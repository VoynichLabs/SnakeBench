You're currently at (4, 3) with no body, so you can move freely without worrying about hitting yourself.\n2. The closest apple is at (3, 3) - just one cell to the left.\n3. The enemy snake is far away (at (9,7)) and not an immediate threat.\n4. Moving LEFT to (3, 3) would let you eat the apple and grow to length 2.\n\nSafe moves analysis:\n- UP to (4, 4): Safe (empty space)\n- DOWN to (4, 2): Safe (empty space)\n- LEFT to (3, 3): Safe (apple there)\n- RIGHT to (5, 3): Safe (empty space)\n\nAll four directions are safe moves. The best choice is clearly LEFT to eat the apple at (3, 3). This will:\n1. Give you your first point\n2. Grow your snake\n3. Move you closer to other apples (there's another at (3, 0) below)\n4. Keep you away from the enemy snake\n\nLong-term strategy note: After eating this apple, we'll have a body segment at (4,3). We should then consider moving down toward the apple at (3,0) while being careful not to trap ourselves.\n\nThe move is:\n\nLEFT",

UP: (3,3) - This is my own body! Would kill me (can't move backwards into own body)\n2. DOWN: (3,1) - Empty space, safe\n3. LEFT: (2,2) - Empty space, safe\n4. RIGHT: (4,2) - Empty space, safe\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- Closest apples are at (3,0) and (2,7)\n- (3,0) is directly below me (3 moves down)\n- (2,7) is to the left and up (5 moves left, 5 moves up)\n\n**Enemy Movement:**\n- Enemy is at (7,7) with body at (8,7)\n- They could move in any direction, but most likely toward apples\n- If they move left toward (6,7), they'd be heading toward apple at (2,7)\n- If they move down toward (7,6), they'd be heading toward apples at (1,6),(1,5)\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Avoid moving UP (would kill me)\n2. Consider moving DOWN toward (3,0) apple - this is a clear path\n3. Moving LEFT toward (2,7) apple is also good but longer path\n4. Moving RIGHT would take me away from both closest apples\n\n**Best Move:**\nDOWN is the most direct path to the closest apple at (3,0) and keeps me safe. It also maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Continue moving DOWN to reach (3,0) apple\n- After collecting that apple, reassess position relative to other apples\n- Monitor enemy snake's movement to avoid potential collisions\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. So I'm in charge of Snake 1. Let me start by understanding the current state.\n\nMy snake's head is at (4,7), and the body is [(4,6)]. So right now, my body is just one segment behind the head. The apple collected is 1, and I need to get to 30 to win, but even getting more apples than others could be a win if they're dead. The board has several apples: (1,6), (1,5), (8,0), (2,7), (1,7). Wait, but I need to check if those apples are still available. Hmm, the problem says that when a snake eats an apple, it's collected. Since my snake has 1 apple, maybe some of those apples have already been eaten. Wait, the apples list is given as at the start of the turn. So they might still be there. Unless someone else has eaten them. The enemy snake has 2 apples. So maybe (8,0) and one of the others? Not sure, but maybe I should check which apples I can reach.\n\nFirst, let's think about possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. From my current head position (4,7), moving up would take me to (4,8), down to (4,6), left to (3,7), right to (5,7). But wait, my last move was UP. Wait, the last move was UP. Wait, in the last turn, I moved UP. But now, if I move again upwards, that would be a new move. But each move is independent. However, the rules say that moving directly backward into your own body counts as a kill. Wait, but my body is [(4,6)], which is the cell below my head. If I move up to (4,8), then my new body would be the previous head (4,7). So moving up would not go into my body. Alternatively, if I move down to (4,6), which is my current body. That would be moving into my own body, which is a kill. So that's not allowed. So moving down is invalid. So possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Let me confirm that. Because moving down into (4,6) is my body, which is a segment. So that's a death. So invalid. So possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. \n\nWait, but the body is [(4,6)]. The head is at (4,7). So moving down would take me to (4,6), which is the body. So that's invalid. So the only possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nBut the last move was UP. So my previous move was UP. But each move is a new direction choice. So the direction history doesn't restrict the next move except for the immediate next step. Because the move is only one step. So the previous direction (UP) doesn't matter, except for possible patterns, but the rules don't have a restriction against moving in the same direction again unless moving into the body. So in this case, moving UP again is possible if it's safe.\n\nSo the immediate safety check: for each direction, check if the new head position is within the board, not a snake's body (including own), and not a head-on collision with another snake's head.\n\nLet's check each direction.\n\n1. UP: new head (4,8). Check if that's in the board. The board is 10x10, so y ranges from 0 (bottom) to 9 (top). 8 is valid. Now check if (4,8) is in any snake's body. The enemy snake #0's body is [(5,0), (4,0)], and head at (6,0). So (4,8) is not in their body. My own body is [(4,6)], so (4,8) is safe. Also, check head-on collision. The enemy snake is at (6,0), so no collision. So moving UP is safe. \n\n2. LEFT: new head (3,7). Check if that's in the board. x=3 is okay. Check if (3,7) is in any snake's body. The enemy snake's positions are (6,0), (5,0), (4,0). So (3,7) is not in their body. My own body is (4,6). So (3,7) is safe. Also, no other snakes' heads are at (3,7). So LEFT is safe.\n\n3. RIGHT: new head (5,7). Check if in the board. Yes. Check if (5,7) is in any snake's body. The enemy's body is at (5,0), (4,0), etc. So (5,7) is not in their body. My own body is (4,6). So (5,7) is safe. Check head-on collision. The enemy's head is at (6,0), so no. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all three directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are possible. Now, need to evaluate which is best.\n\nThe objectives are to collect apples and avoid collisions. Let's look at the apples positions. The apples are at (1,6), (1,5), (8,0), (2,7), (1,7). Let me see where those are relative to my possible moves.\n\nCurrent head at (4,7). Let's see:\n\n- (1,6): left 3, down 1. Maybe possible but needs some steps.\n- (1,5): even further down and left.\n- (8,0): far to the right and down. Not sure if that's reachable.\n- (2,7): left 2 from my current position. If I move left once (to 3,7), then maybe left again to 2,7. But that's in the next turn. So maybe moving left now could be a step towards that apple.\n- (1,7): left 3 from (4,7). So (1,7) is two cells left from (3,7), which would be after two moves left.\n\nSo the closest apple is (2,7), which is two cells left. So moving left once would take me to (3,7), then next turn could move left again to (2,7) to collect the apple. That would be a good path. But I need to make sure that in the next steps, I can safely reach there without colliding.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,8) might not be near any apples. Then maybe not the best. But maybe there's a path. Let's see. The apple at (1,7) is directly left of (3,7) (since x=1, y=7). So if I move left to (3,7), then next move left to (2,7) (another left), then left again to (1,7). That's three moves. But I need to ensure that each step is safe. Let's check each step.\n\nFirst, moving left to (3,7). Then next direction could be left again to (2,7). Then left again to (1,7). Each step would need to be safe. Let's see:\n\nFirst move left to (3,7). Then next move left to (2,7). Then left to (1,7). But during each step, the enemy snakes are moving. Wait, but the enemy is snake 0. Their head is at (6,0), body (5,0), (4,0). So their path is moving... Well, we don't know their next moves. They might move in any direction. So this is a risk. But since we can't predict their moves, maybe it's better to go towards the apple (2,7) as it's a possible way to collect an apple quickly, which gives +1 point and increases my lead.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (5,7) would be towards the apple at (8,0)? Not really. (5,7) is x=5, y=7. (8,0) is x=8, y=0. That's a big distance. So maybe not the best direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (4,8). From there, maybe I can go left or right to approach apples. But (4,8) is in the upper half. The apples at (1,7) and (1,6) are in lower x, same y levels. So maybe moving up isn't the best direction.\n\nSo between LEFT and RIGHT. But LEFT seems better because (2,7) is an apple. Let me check if (2,7) is an apple. Yes, according to the apples list. So moving left towards (2,7) would allow me to collect that apple. But I need to make sure that moving left now is part of a path that can reach (2,7) without hitting anything.\n\nSo first, moving left to (3,7). Then next turn, moving left again to (2,7). Then collect the apple. So that's two moves. But in the next turn, after moving left to (3,7), I need to check if (3,7) is safe and that the next move left to (2,7) is also safe. But since the enemy's position is at (6,0) etc., maybe their movement won't affect (2,7) in the next few turns. But that's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left now, then next turn I can move left again. But what if in the next turn, the enemy snake moves in a way that blocks me? Not sure. But since we can't predict enemy moves, we have to assume they might move unpredictably.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that moving left now would take me towards (2,7), which is an apple. So that's a good step. Alternatively, moving right might not be as beneficial. \n\nAnother point: moving up might not lead to any apples immediately, but maybe there's a path. But the apples at (1,7) are at y=7, which is the same as my current y. So moving left towards (2,7) is better. \n\nSo the best move here is LEFT. Because it's a step towards the apple at (2,7), which is collectable in two moves. Also, after moving left to (3,7), maybe then up or left again. \n\nWait, but after moving left to (3,7), the next move would be to (2,7), which is an apple. So that's a possible path. Let me check if (2,7) is safe. The apple is at (2,7), but when I move there, I can collect it. But during that move, I need to make sure that (2,7) is not occupied by any snake's body or head. \n\nThe enemy snake's current positions are (6,0), (5,0), (4,0). So (2,7) is not in their body. My current body after moving left to (3,7) would be (4,7) (previous head). So (2,7) is safe. So yes, moving left now is a good step.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake's head is at (6,0). If they move towards me, maybe they could collide. But since they are at (6,0), and moving in any direction, unless they move up, which is unlikely. But since we can't predict, we can't plan for that. \n\nSo the best move is LEFT. That way, I can reach (2,7) next turn and collect an apple. That would increase my apple count to 2, which is better than the enemy's 2. But wait, the enemy has 2 apples. If I collect another, I would have 2, but maybe they might collect more. But in any case, moving towards an apple is a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might not be as beneficial. But perhaps there's another apple near there. Let me check. The apple at (1,7) is at (1,7), which is two left from (3,7). So moving left twice would reach there. But (1,7) is another apple. So maybe after (2,7), I can go to (1,7). But that's a longer path. \n\nBut for this turn, moving LEFT is the best option. So I think the answer is LEFT.\nLEFT",
