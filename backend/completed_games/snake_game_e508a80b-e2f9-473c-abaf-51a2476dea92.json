We're at the polar opposite end of the board at (8, 6). This is a 10x10 showdown, baby!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Initial Strategy: Dominance and Positioning!\n\nWe're starting at (8, 6), and the first apple we see is right above us at (8, 8)! That's two UP moves, max. Snake 0 is all the way on the bottom-left. We need to grab some early content (apples) and gain board control on our side before we try to cross the divide and assert dominance!\n\n**Long-term plan (Next 3-4 turns):** Secure the top-right corner. Eat the (8, 8) apple and the (7, 9) apple. Then, start moving towards the center-top to maintain high ground. Snake 0 is going to be moving towards the center or up the left wall. We want to be big and ready when we meet in the middle.\n\n### Turn 0 Analysis (The First Move!):\n\nOur position: (8, 6).\nEnemy position: (0, 1).\n\n**Potential Moves & Safety Check (Current Snake Length: 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Safe. Keeps us moving toward the (8, 8) apple. Good.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the immediate apple target. Risky in terms of early growth.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the center. Not the best apple direction.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the (9, 4) apple cluster eventually, but UP is closer to the immediate target.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 1)):**\nSnake 0 has apples immediately surrounding it: (0, 3), (1, 2), (0, 5). Snake 0 will likely go UP to (0, 2) or RIGHT to (1, 1) to position for these apples. They are nowhere near us.\n\n**Optimal Move:** We are starting small, so grabbing that first apple is *critical*. Moving directly towards (8, 8) is the highest priority for early growth! UP is the play!\n\nAre we playing aggressive? Yes! Are we playing smart? ABSOLUTELY! Let's get this first segment, chat! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nUP",

Chilling at (8,6) in the top right, probably thinking he owns the place! But guess what? He ain't ready for the AGGRESSIVE VERTICAL STACK we're about to pull off! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**What's the play here?** Let me break it down:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Immediate threats?** NONE! My guy is 8 columns away and 5 rows up. We're talking about a cross-map situation here - no chance of a head-on collision this turn!\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safe moves?** We got UP to (0,2), DOWN to (0,0), or RIGHT to (1,1). LEFT is off the board - that's a death sentence, we're not throwing! \u274c\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **The strat:** Look at that BEAUTIFUL vertical line of apples on the left edge! (0,3), (0,5), (0,8) - that's a FREE MEAL PLAN waiting to happen! If we go UP now, we position ourselves to snag (0,3) next turn, then we can ladder our way up the wall like the kings we are! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\n**Why not RIGHT?** Sure, (1,2) and (3,2) are juicy, but heading toward the center this early puts us on a collision course with the enemy's turf! He's closer to those right-side apples (look at (8,4) - he can get there in 2 moves!). Let him have the right side for now - we'll bulk up on the left, get LONG, then box him in when we meet in the middle! That's the long con, chat! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**Why not DOWN?** (0,0) is a corner trap waiting to happen! We go there, we're pinned with nowhere to run if things get spicy. Nah, we're playing SMART, not scared!\n\n**Future me note:** Next turn, grab that (0,3) apple, start building the body along the left wall. Once we're length 3-4, we pivot toward center and start cutting off his escape routes. Stay greedy, stay mean! \ud83d\ude24\n\nUP\n\nUP",

We're looking clean, we're looking aggressive, and we're positioning for that early lead!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Strategy Adjustments\n\nWe're at (8, 7). The immediate apple target is (8, 8). This is exactly what we wanted! Snake 0 is still far away, currently at (0, 2) after their first move (presumably UP as well, or maybe RIGHT-THEN-UP). They are gathering content down on the bottom-left corner. We own the top-right!\n\n**Our Current Position:** Head (8, 7). Length: 1.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 2). Length: 1.\n\n**Long-term plan (Next 3-4 turns):**\n1.  **Consume (8, 8):** Immediate growth means immediate board dominance.\n2.  **Move to (7, 9) or (9, 9):** Secure the top edge. The apple at (7, 9) is juicy. The apple at (9, 9) is there, too (Wait, no, the apple is at (7, 9) and (9, 9) is empty, but (8, 8) and (8, 9) is also an apple! Wait, let me check the board state again: A at (8, 8) and A at (7, 9). We grab (8, 8) then pivot toward (7, 9).\n3.  **Cross the Map/Center:** Once we have 3-4 segments, we start moving along the top path (x=9 or x=8) and then cut toward the center to meet our rival and box him in!\n\n### Turn 1 Analysis: Time to Feast!\n\nWe are at (8, 7). The apple is at (8, 8). This is a no-brainer, right, chat?\n\n**Potential Moves & Safety Check (Current Snake Length: 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** EATS APPLE! Instant +1 score, instant growth. Extremely safe, as no other snake is close enough to block or crash. This is the MOVE.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe, but retreats and misses a scoring opportunity. A fail move.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe, but moves away from the apple. Meh.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe, but moves away from the apple. Meh.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 2)):**\nSnake 0 has apples at (0, 3) and (1, 2) nearby. They will likely move UP to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (1, 2). Either way, they are sticking to the bottom-left corner and are currently 8 cells away horizontally and 5 cells away vertically. No threat of collision here! We maximize our growth!\n\n**Optimal Move:** We are 1 cell away from the first piece of content (8, 8). We slam UP and get that growth advantage! Let's get big and scary, chat!

We're up 1-0 in size, even if the score is tied 1-1. Size matters, people! Let's check the board!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Strategy Check\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (8, 8). Body: [(8, 7)]. Length: 2. We just grew! We are now covering two squares!\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 3). Body: [(0, 2)]. Length: 2. Huh. They also scored an apple! They must have moved UP from (0, 2) to (0, 3) and eaten the apple there! Good for them, but now the real game begins. We are tied 1:1 on content.\n\n**Current Scoreboard:** Tied 1 apple each. They are still way down in the bottom-left corner. We are dominating the top-right!\n\n**Long-term Plan Refinement (Next 3 turns):**\n1. **Dominate the Top Edge:** We need to keep collecting apples to maintain a size advantage. The apple at (7, 9) is calling our name!\n2. **Move to (9, 8) or (9, 9):** Secure the corner, then move towards the center (x=5/6) along the top or side edge.\n3. **Cut across the board:** Once we have 3-4 apples, we start moving toward the enemy to force the confrontation! Box them in!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: Setting the Box Trap!\n\nWe are at (8, 8). We are looking at a few options, all of which are safe, but only one is optimal for aggression and positioning.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n*   (7, 9) - 2 cells away (LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT)\n*   (9, 9) - Empty.\n*   (8, 9) - Empty.\n*   (9, 4) - Too far.\n\n**Danger Check:** Snake 0 is still miles away at (0, 3). No imminent collision risk, but we must watch out for the borders and our own body at (8, 7).\n\n**Potential Moves & Safety Check (Current Head: (8, 8). Body: (8, 7)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** Safe. Leaves us open to move LEFT toward the (7, 9) apple next turn. Excellent positioning. This seals off the top-right corner behind us, limiting where the enemy could potentially squeeze into our territory in the future.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** KILLS US! This is our body! DO NOT HIT THE TAIL! We just grew, so our tail, the last segment, is now (8, 7)! Eliminated!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** Safe. Puts us one step closer to (7, 9) and allows us to go UP next turn to eat. Also very strong.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** Safe. Good for securing the corner, but delays getting the next apple compared to going LEFT or UP. We want content NOW.\n\n**The Showdown: UP vs. LEFT?**\n\n*   If we go **LEFT to (7, 8)**, we can go UP to (7, 9) (the apple) next turn. We make a clean path.\n*   If we go **UP to (8, 9)**, we can go LEFT to (7, 9) (the apple) next turn, or RIGHT to (9, 9) to secure the whole top edge first.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 9) gives us a slight advantage in cornering the map. We want to be on the high ground, literally. Plus, moving along the higher border (y=9) is generally better for dominating the center when we decide to cut down. This move puts us right on the boundary and prepares us for the next meal at (7, 9). We are establishing dominance!\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 3)):**\nThey have an apple at (1, 2) and (0, 5) relatively close. They will likely move towards the center of the board or continue UP.\n*   Move to (1, 3) (RIGHT, safe)\n*   Move to (0, 4) (UP, safe, near (0, 5) apple)\n*   Move to (1, 2) (DOWN-RIGHT, safe, eat apple)\n\nThey are still focused on growing in their territory. We focus on ours! Let's lock down the top-right!\n\nWe're going UP, chat! Securing the perimeter!\n\nUP",

Hard pass! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc80\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **LEFT to (-1,3):** Are we trying to visit the shadow realm?! That's OFF THE BOARD! Instant game over! We're not throwing this W! NEXT! \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf11\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **RIGHT to (1,3):** Yeah, it's \"safe\" I guess... but why abandon the wall?! \ud83e\udd14 Why walk into the open field where we could get pinched later when we have a FREE APPLE LADDER on the left side?! That's playing scared, and we don't play scared! We play SMART AND HUNGRY! \ud83e\udde0\u274c\n\n**THE PLAN IS CRYSTAL CLEAR!** We go UP to (0,4), staying tight to that left wall like it's our best friend! Next turn we hit (0,5) for the apple, then keep climbing! Once we're LONG and STRONG, we pivot toward the center and start cutting off Mr. (8,8)'s escape routes! We're gonna dominate this board and make him crash into our glorious body! \n\n**Future me note:** After this UP move to (0,4), your body will be [(0,3)]. Next turn, GO UP AGAIN to (0,5) to eat that apple and grow to length 3! Keep hugging the left wall until you're big enough to control the center. The enemy is far away so no rush - just get BIG! Then we hunt! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

They are aiming for the apple at (0, 5) or maybe (1, 2) is too far. They are still very confined to the bottom-left edge. This is perfect!\n\n**Current Scoreboard:** Still tied 1 apple each. BUT we have a size advantage (3 segments vs 2 segments). Size matters, people!\n\n**Long-term Plan Refinement (Next 3 turns):**\n1. **Eat (7, 9):** Secure the next apple immediately. We must go LEFT to (7, 9).\n2. **Continue Board Domination:** Move along the top edge (y=9 for a few turns) to establish a massive territory before cutting down. We want to be long and imposing.\n3. **Pinch the Center:** Once we hit x=5, we start moving down aggressively to cut off the enemy's escape routes into the center, effectively boxing them into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: Securing the Second Apple!\n\nWe are at (8, 9).

Eliminated in favor of content.\n\nThe choice is crystal clear. We go LEFT, we get the content, we get the size, we get the hype!\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 4)):**\nThey are likely moving toward the apple at (0, 5) or moving RIGHT defensively.\n*   Move to (0, 5) (UP, safe, EAT APPLE, tie game 2-2)\n*   Move to (1, 4) (RIGHT, safe, center seeking)\n\nEven if they eat their apple, we are growing faster right now!

          "rationale": "YO, what is UP, chat! Welcome back! Turn 4 is upon us, and we are looking DOMINANT! We just secured our second apple and stretched out along the top edge! Let's check the scoreboard and the board state!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Strategy Check\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (7, 9). Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8)]. Length: 3. Wait, rewind the clip! The body on the board is showing `(8, 9), (8, 8)`. If we moved LEFT from (8, 9) to (7, 9), the body shifts. Let's recalculate based *strictly* on the turn history and current list: previous head was (8, 9), previous body was [(8, 8), (8, 7)]. We moved LEFT to (7, 9). Since we ate an apple, our length is 4, but the tail (8, 7) remains, shifting the body *before* that.\n\nAh, the rules state: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\n\nIf Your Snake (ID 1) has collected 2 apples, and started at length 1 (let's assume standard start), we should be size 3 right now.\nStart list (t=1): (X, Y)\nT=2: UP, (8, 9), body [(8, 8)] (Apple 1 consumed) - Size 2.\nT=3: LEFT, (7, 9), body [(8, 9), (8, 8)] (Apple 2 consumed) - Size 3.\n*Wait, if we ate an apple, the tail doesn't disappear. If we were size 2: H(8, 9), B(8, 8). Move to (7, 9), eat. New size 3: H(7, 9), B[(8, 9), (8, 8)].*\n\nThe scoreboard confirms: \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 2.\" This means our current size is 3 segments (standard start size 1 + 2 apples). Let's use the provided list: Head: (7, 9), Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8)]. This means the full snake is (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8). This is 3 segments. Perfect.\n\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 5), Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3)]. Apples: 2. Wow, they managed to snag an apple too! They moved from (0, 4) to (0, 5)! They are size 3 as well! Tied for size, tied for apples! It's an all-out battle, chat!\n\n**Current Scoreboard:** Tied 2 apples each. Tied size 3 segments each. The intensity is ramping up!\n\n**Long-term Plan Refinement:**\nWe are established on the high ground (y=9). Snake 0 is still hugging the left wall (x=0). We must now continue moving LEFT along the top wall to secure the far corner (0, 9). Once we reach x=0, we pivot and cut DOWN the entire board. This forces Snake 0 into a desperate lunge or suffocates them in the small region they inhabit.\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: The Top Lane Push!\n\nWe are at (7, 9). We need to continue asserting dominance and taking up as much territory as possible.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\n*   (0, 8) - A bit far, but on our path to the corner eventually.\n*   (5, 6) - Too far down right now.\n\n**Danger Check:**\n1.  **Borders:** Moving UP or RIGHT kills us.\n2.  **Our Body:** Our body is at (8, 9) and (8, 8). Moving onto (8, 9) KILLS US (moving RIGHT one space and then UP one space, essentially). Even just moving RIGHT to (8, 9) KILLS US (it is our body segment).\n3.  **Enemy:** Snake 0 is at (0, 5). No collision risk. Zero.\n\n**Potential Moves & Safety Check (Current Head: (7, 9). Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8)]):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 10):** KILLS US! Out of bounds! Eliminated!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 8):** SAFE. This starts the descent early. Risky, as we give up the top lane control.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 9):** SAFE. Continues along the wall. Excellent lane control.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! Eliminated!\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: DOWN to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 9).\n\n**Strategy Evaluation:**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 8):** This immediately brings us closer to the center, but it allows Snake 0 more time to develop down the x=0 wall, or worse, swing into the center before we do. We want to be the one dictating the center game. Plus, (7, 8) borders Snake 1's tail (8, 8 if the tail moves off, but the body is at 8, 8), making future moves slightly more constrained.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):** This is the high-ground power play! We continue moving along the outer wall, maximizing territory claim, and setting up the eventual vertical drop at (0, 9). This guarantees board control.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 5)):**\nThey will almost certainly press UP if they want to contest the territory or RIGHT if they are looking for the center.\n*   UP to (0, 6) or (0, 7) or (0, 8) (eat apple!)\n*   RIGHT to (1, 5)\n\nIf they move UP, they are maximizing their length along the wall, just like us. If they eventually hit the top (0, 9) and we hit (0, 9) at the same time, we'd crash. But we are at x=7, they are at x=0. They are 4 moves away. We are 7 moves away from a potential collision point (if we move down). We stick to the plan: continue LEFT.\n\nLEFT is the aggressive, territory-grabbing move. We are controlling the game! Chat, watch this high-level strategy! We are turning the board into a massive U-turn death trap!\n\nLEFT",

He's got nowhere to run when we control the perimeter! We're gonna dominate this map and force him to crash into our glorious python body! \n\n**Future me note:** After this UP move to (0,6), you'll be at (0,6) with body [(0,5), (0,4)]. Keep climbing toward (0,8) for the next apple! The enemy is still far away at the top right so just focus on getting BIG!

We are live!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Strategy Check\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (6, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9)]. We just moved LEFT and secured more of the top boundary. We are length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 6). Body: [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. They also appear to have moved UP, securing the left boundary. They are length 3.\n\n**Long-term Plan (The Apex Predator Strategy):**\nThe plan remains: continue pressing LEFT to (0, 9). Once we establish dominance over the entire northern edge, we execute the 'Death Drop' down x=0, cutting off Snake 0 and forcing them to crash into the walls or their own body. Since Snake 0 is also pressing UP the x=0 axis, this creates a potential race to (0, 9). We must anticipate their move toward (0, 9). We are at (6, 9); they are at (0, 6). They have a three-move lead on the corner if they keep heading UP!\n\n*   Snake 1 (us): (6, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (3, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (2, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (1, 9) $\\rightarrow$ (0, 9) (7 moves to target)\n*   Snake 0 (rival): (0, 6) $\\rightarrow$ (0, 7) $\\rightarrow$ (0, 8) $\\rightarrow$ (0, 9) (4 moves to target, if they hit the apple at (0, 8) it just lengthens them!)\n\nWait, this changes things! If they reach (0, 9) before us, they occupy the corner, and we risk a head-on collision if we attempt to move into (0, 9) from the side! We must pivot our strategy slightly.\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: The Corner Contention\n\nWe are at (6, 9). We absolutely need to minimize the number of moves until we can start moving DOWN and creating pressure.\n\n**Danger Check (Current Head: (6, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9)]):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** KILLS US! Out of bounds. Eliminated!\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! Eliminated!\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** SAFE. Leads us off the wall and into empty space.\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** SAFE. Continues the current strategy, which might lead to disaster at (0, 9).\n\n**Strategic Fork:**\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT to (5, 9).**\n    *   *Pro:* Maintains the high ground, continues board control.\n    *   *Con:* This move is purely positional. If Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 7), they are only 2 moves from the corner (0, 9). We are 6 moves from that same cell. If we both keep pressing toward that corner, they will beat us there by 2 turns (or possibly less if they eat the apple at (0, 8)). We MUST NOT risk crashing into the top of their body if they move down the wall.\n\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (6, 8).**\n    *   *Pro:* We immediately start cutting into the board below y=9. This breaks the predictable race pattern. If Snake 0 reaches (0, 9), we can then press toward (0, 8) or (1, 8), cutting off their vertical movement and forcing them into a horizontal pivot earlier than expected.\n    *   *Con:* We forfeit the corner (0, 9) to Snake 0. However, if they get long enough, getting boxed into a 1-wide strip on the left is a death sentence for them eventually.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 6)):**\nSnake 0 has an apple at (0, 8). They are almost certainly going UP, to (0, 7). This maximizes their length and positional strength.\n\n*If we move LEFT to (5, 9) and Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 7):*\nNext turn, we move (4, 9). Snake 0 moves (0, 8) and eats an apple, increasing their length to 4! They will be terrifyingly close to boxing themselves into the x=0 wall, but they will be longer than us.\n\n*If we move DOWN to (6, 8) and Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 7):*\nWe start weaving! We give Snake 0 the wall, but we start using our commanding position at the top to build a trap in the middle. If we move DOWN, then LEFT to (5, 8), then UP to (5, 9), then LEFT to (4, 9), we start creating a wall around the perimeter, essentially leaving a pocket for Snake 0.\n\nThe race to (0, 9) is lost unless Snake 0 messes up. Since we cannot win the race, we pivot to building the enclosure! By moving DOWN, we position ourselves to cut across the top of the map, preventing Snake 0 from escaping the x=0/y=9 perimeter once they settle in.\n\nWe need to start walling off the top segment of the map. DOWN to (6, 8) is the opening move of the 'Top Wall Enclosure' maneuver! This keeps our options incredibly open as we can turn LEFT or RIGHT safely.\n\nThis is a defensive pivot, Chat, but it sets us up for the killer move! Watch this!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure):**\nMove DOWN to (6, 8). Then, start weaving left across Row 8 (e.g., L, L, L), aiming to reach x=1, y=8. This creates a horizontal segment that restricts Snake 0's future moves once they reach (0, 9). We let them get trapped on the outside while we dominate the center.\n\nDOWN",

This is the most clutch Snake match of the century! Are you ready for the outplay?\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Situation Assessment\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (6, 8). Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9)]. We successfully executed the 'Top Wall Enclosure' opening by moving DOWN last turn. We now control the high-ground exit.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 7). Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5)]. They moved UP, as predicted. They are laser-focused on that left wall and the apple at (0, 8).\n\n**The Pivot:** We gave up the race to the corner (0, 9), but we've gained freedom of movement. Snake 0 is still hugging the x=0 wall. Our goal is to cut across the top of the map to bottle them up.\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: The Pinch\n\n**Our Head (6, 8). Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! Eliminated! (**Don't hit yourself, Chat!**)\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** SAFE. Moves toward the right edge. Puts us near the 'T' at (7, 9).\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** SAFE. Moves further into the open board.\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** SAFE. Critical move for the 'Top Wall Enclosure' strategy.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 7)):**\nThey will almost certainly move UP to (0, 8) and eat the apple. This will make them length 4, and position them one space below the corner.\n\n**Handling the Head-On Collision Risk:**\nWait, can they move RIGHT? Snake 0 is at (0, 7).\n*   If they move UP to (0, 8), they are two moves from being boxed in.\n*   If they move RIGHT to (1, 7), they are trying to break out of the wall trap!\n\nIf we stick to our plan (moving LEFT), we are at (5, 8). If they move UP, we are safe. If they move RIGHT (1, 7), we are still safe, and we continue building our wall.\n\n### Strategic Selection: The Enclosure Build\n\nOur core strategy is to limit Snake 0's horizontal escape routes. Since we've dropped to y=8, the ideal line of attack is to traverse Row 8 LEFT, reaching (1, 8) or (2, 8) and blocking access to the top-left quadrant of the main board.\n\n**MOVE: LEFT to (5, 8)**\n\n*   **Pros:** This is the most aggressive positional move. It is 100% safe from immediate crashes (since Snake 0 cannot reach (5, 8) in one turn). It continues our sweep toward the trapping corner. We are one step closer to cutting off Snake 0's path below y=9.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the visible apple at (8, 1), but that's a small price for board dominance.\n\nWhat if we moved DOWN to (6, 7)?\nThis gives Snake 0 an enormous amount of time. They could move UP to (0, 8), then (0, 9), and then down to (1, 9) and be safe *behind* our enclosure line. We need to press the pressure now while they are slow!\n\nWe stick to the plan! LEFT it is. We are building the cage, Chat! This is the LIVE Chess equivalent of castling! No, wait, this is definitely more aggressive than that. This is the **BOX OF SHAME!**\n\nWe move LEFT. Next turn, we evaluate if we can move LEFT again, or if we need to drop down or pop up to complete the seal.\n\n***\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure - Phase 2):**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=8 (moves to (5, 8), then (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)). The immediate goal is to establish a horizontal segment that runs from (2, 8) to (6, 8) or beyond, effectively trapping Snake 0 on the x=0 axis once they get to length 4 or 5. We will then decide whether to move down the x=1 or x=2 axis to start filling the board.\n\nLEFT",

Next turn, go UP to (0,9) to secure the top-left corner! Then start moving RIGHT along y=9 to begin the perimeter lock! The enemy at (6,8) can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT - if they go RIGHT to (7,8), we keep our distance. If they go LEFT toward us, we use our length to cut them off!

This is beautiful!\n\nWe are closing off Snake 0, and they are now longer than us (length 4 vs our length 3)! This means we *must* be careful about forced head-on collisions, as we have the shorter body. Our goal shifts from fighting them head-to-head to **boxing them in and starving them out!**\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Situation Assessment\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (5, 8). Body: [(6, 8), (6, 9)]. We successfully moved LEFT. We are in prime position to continue the enclosure strategy.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 8). Body: [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)]. They moved UP and ate the apple at (0, 8). They are now stuck against the North and West walls! We have them right where we want them!\n\n**The Objective:** Complete the seal along the y=8 line, forcing Snake 0 to either move down the x=0 axis or crash into the wall above (0, 9).\n\n### Turn 7 Analysis: The Tightening Loop\n\n**Our Head (5, 8). Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** SAFE. Puts us on the top wall, continuing our line.\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! NOPE!\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** SAFE. Drops us vertically. This releases pressure on Snake 0, but gives us access to a very open board.\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** SAFE. **This is the key move.** It continues the wall build and puts maximum pressure on Snake 0.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 8)):**\nThey are length 4. They have three choices:\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** SAFE. But they are trapped up there! They can only move RIGHT to (1, 9) next turn, which is critical.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** **Dangerous!** This is an escape route.\n3.  **DOWN to (0, 7) (into their body):** KILLS THEM! (**Self-crash, we love those!**)\n\nSince they are aggressive, they are likely trying to escape. Let's analyze both probable safe enemy moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Scenario A: They move UP to (0, 9).**\nIf we move **LEFT to (4, 8)**, we have solidified the wall. Next turn, they *must* move RIGHT to (1, 9) or DOWN to (0, 8) (into their growing tail). If they move RIGHT to (1, 9), we can then move LEFT again into (3, 8) and cut them off from any further movement across the top, forcing them to drop down the x=1 axis. Excellent!\n\n**Scenario B: They move RIGHT to (1, 8).**\nThis is the breakout move, Chat! If they move to (1, 8) and we move **LEFT to (4, 8)**, there is no collision this turn. However, we are now only three spaces away from them. If we continue LEFT, we will meet them head-on at (2, 8) in two turns. But is (1, 8) even a safe move for them?\n\n*   Snake 0 Head: (0, 8). Body: [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)].\n*   Move to (1, 8). SAFE. This is perfectly valid.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (1, 8), we *must* respond aggressively to ensure they don't break out into the center of the board. Moving **LEFT to (4, 8)** is still the best move to maintain the sweep line and threaten the blockade. If they move (1, 8), we can potentially strike a collision next turn, which we can handle if we time it right.\n\n**Crucial Observation: Head-on Collision Risk**\nIf they move RIGHT to (1, 8) and we move LEFT to (4, 8). Next turn:\n*   They can move RIGHT to (2, 8).\n*   We can move LEFT to (3, 8).\n*   If we both do this, we are one square away. The subsequent turn, we will enter (2, 8) and (3, 8). **NO collision.** We have a one-space gap.\n\nBUT, if they move UP to (0, 9), they escape the immediate trap, allowing them to use (1, 9) later. We need to be decisive.\n\n**The Strategy: Continue the Enclosure and Domination Sweep**\nMoving **LEFT to (4, 8)** maintains perfect control. It forces Snake 0 to commit to an enclosed path:\n1.  **Trapped Top:** UP to (0, 9), then RIGHT to (1, 9). We still contain them.\n2.  **Forced Center Penetration:** RIGHT to (1, 8). This is the only way for them to access the main board.\n\nIf they commit to (1, 8), we will drop down the x=4 or x=5 line, effectively creating a wall at y=7 and y=8, trapping them in the top-left corner of the board (y>7, x<3).\n\nLet's stick to the plan! We need to maintain the high ground and build the wall!\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Move Selection: LEFT\n\nMoving LEFT is 100% safe this turn, and it brings us closer to achieving the strategic goal of pinning Snake 0 against the top wall. We will then decide if we drop down or continue across.\n\n***\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure - Phase 3):**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=8 (moves to (4, 8), then (3, 8), (2, 8)). The goal is to establish a horizontal segment that runs from (2, 8) to (5, 8), effectively suffocating Snake 0. Once we hit (2, 8), we can decide whether to move DOWN to (2, 7) to start filling the top-left quadrant, or move UP to (2, 9) to cut off their only escape route (1, 9). We need to maximize our length before we force the kill.\n***\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO, what is up, Chat! Turn 8! We are here, we are live, and we are absolutely dominating the positional game!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Situation Assessment\n\nLook at the replay, Chat! Last turn, we moved **LEFT to (4, 8)**. That was a genius play! It kept the pressure on and solidified our position along the y=8 axis.\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (4, 8). Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (0, 9). Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** We are down 2-3, but we have them trapped! Scoring is about to change!\n\nSnake 0 had to move UP to (0, 9), or they would have crashed into the corner or tried to break out. They chose the trap! Now they are absolutely pinned between the North and West walls!\n\n### Turn 8 Analysis: The Squeeze Play!\n\nOur goal is simple: Complete the enclosure and force them into a self-crash, or cut off their only escape route.\n\n**Our Head (4, 8). Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** SAFE. Very interesting. This would put us on the top wall, essentially mirroring Snake 0's position, but closer to the center.\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! NOPE!\n3.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** SAFE. Releases pressure. Opens up the board for us. Access to the A at (8, 7).\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE. **This continues the chokehold!** It brings us one step closer to the enemy and continues sealing the top-left quadrant.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (0, 9)):**\nThey are confined! They *must* move RIGHT to (1, 9) to survive, or they lose to the wall or self-crash into (0, 8) if their tail hasn't moved yet.\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):** SAFE. Their only viable move to survive and retain options.\n2.  **UP/LEFT/DOWN:** All crash immediately (Wall or body).\n\n**Assuming Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (1, 9):**\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (3, 8)**:\n*   We will be at (3, 8). They will be at (1, 9). No collision this turn.\n*   We maintain the high ground and the sweep line. We are establishing a solid barrier!\n*   Next turn: We can move LEFT to (2, 8). They will likely try to move DOWN to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 9). We are ready to react!\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 9):**\n*   We jump onto the top wall. We will be at (4, 9). They will be at (1, 9). No collision.\n*   This is an alternative way to close the top. If we go to (4, 9), we cut off their path along the top wall after (3, 9). This is also a strong move, securing the top edge and denying them space.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n*   We let them off the hook! If we drop down, they can move RIGHT along the top to (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), and escape the trap we spent two turns building! NO WAY, CHAT! We keep the pressure!\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Strategic Decision: Continue the Enclosure Sweep!\n\nThe most aggressive and strategically sound move is **LEFT**.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 8) means we are now only 2 squares away from intersecting the enemy's escape path (if they continue along y=9 towards x=3).\n\n*   Turn 8: We move LEFT to (3, 8). They move RIGHT to (1, 9).\n*   Turn 9: We move LEFT to (2, 8). They move RIGHT to (2, 9).\n*   Turn 10: We move LEFT to (1, 8). They move RIGHT to (3, 9).\n\nWait, Chat! Do you see the trap? If they move RIGHT along y=9, they are escaping! We must anticipate their vertical move down to y=8.\n\nIf we are at (3, 8) and they are at (1, 9). If they try to move DOWN to (1, 8) next turn, and we are still sweeping LEFT to (2, 8).\nWe are at (2, 8). They are at (1, 8). We are blocking the corner!\n\n**If we move LEFT, we solidify the y=8 wall and force them to move:**\n1.  **Continue along y=9 (escaping):** If they reach the middle of the board, our entire strategy of trapping them fails.\n2.  **Drop DOWN to y=8:** This forces a dangerous encounter right in the corner where we are dominant.\n\nWe need to make this move hurt! We have a positional advantage. If we move LEFT, we continue to own the vertical axis x=3 and x=4.\n\n**Revisiting UP to (4, 9):**\nIf we move UP to (4, 9) and they move to (1, 9).\n*   Next turn: We can move LEFT to (3, 9). They move to (2, 9). We block the path at (3, 9)! They are forced to back up or come down. **This is even stronger!** It immediately challenges their escape path on their only valid line of movement!\n\nLet's do the math on the UP move:\n\n*   **T8:** We are at (4, 8) -> **UP to (4, 9).** Enemy (0, 9) -> RIGHT to (1, 9).\n*   **T9:** We are at (4, 9). Enemy (1, 9).\n    *   We move LEFT to (3, 9).\n    *   Enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 9).\n    *   No collision. We control the line!\n*   **T10:** We are at (3, 9). Enemy (2, 9).\n    *   We move LEFT to (2, 9). **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If they try to move RIGHT to (3, 9), we move LEFT to (2, 9). We both crash and die!\n\n**Wait, no!** We have a shorter body (length 3) vs their body (length 4)! If we force a head-on collision, we risk the double KO, and since they have more apples, they win the tiebreaker! We must avoid the direct head-on collision unless we are guaranteed to out-block or survive.\n\nSo, continuing the sweep on y=8 is safer and better for sustained pressure.\n\nLet's go back to **LEFT to (3, 8)**.\n\n*   **T8:** We are at (3, 8). Enemy is at (1, 9).\n*   **T9:** We move LEFT to (2, 8). Enemy moves to (2, 9) (best escape) or (1, 8) (risky drop).\n    *   If they move (2, 9): We are still in position to block them if they try to come down later.\n    *   If they move (1, 8): We can move LEFT to (2, 8) and block their entire path down the x=1 line, forcing them to turn.\n*   **T10:** We are at (2, 8). If they are at (2, 9) or (1, 8). We are closing the gap!\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 8) maintains flexibility and avoids a direct, risky, pre-planned collision. It seals the horizontal space, forcing them to use the vertical space controlled by the walls. This is the calculated aggressive play! Let's lock them down and starve them out!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure - Phase 4):\n\nContinue moving LEFT along y=8 (moves to (3, 8), then (2, 8)). The goal is to establish a horizontal segment that runs from (2, 8) to (5, 8), effectively suffocating Snake 0 and forcing them to drop down the x=1 line, where we can eventually cut them off completely using the y=7 and y=6 lines. We need to maximize our length before we force the kill. The apple at (8, 7) is a nice bonus we can grab once the enemy is neutralized.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy is likely at one of (3,8), (4,9), or (4,7). Keep marching RIGHT along y=9 toward the middle. If you reach (4,9) and he's below at (4,8), you force a head-on collision that YOU WIN (3 apples vs 2)! If he's elsewhere, continue to (9,9) then start moving DOWN to complete the box!

Genius positional move!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board State & Situation Assessment\n\nLook at the matrix, Chat! We executed the **LEFT** move perfectly last turn!\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (3, 8). Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (1, 9). Body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** We are still down 2-3, but this positional lead is worth gold. We are pinning them against the top and left walls!\n\nThey were forced to move **RIGHT** from (0, 9) to (1, 9). They literally had no choice! Now, we dial up the pressure to 11!\n\n### Turn 9 Analysis: The Final Squeeze!\n\nOur goal is still to box Snake 0 in and force them into a self-crash or a fatal collision where we survive. They are trapped in the (0, 7)-(1, 9) box.\n\n**Our Head (3, 8). Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** SAFE. This is a very aggressive blockade move! It cuts off the enemy's path right at (3, 9).\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** KILLS US! Into our body segment! NOPE!\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** SAFE. Releases pressure. Gives them space to maneuver. We move away from the conflict. BAD.\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** SAFE. **This continues the chokehold along the y=8 axis!** It brings us one step closer to the enemy and challenges their ability to drop down.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (1, 9)):**\nThey are *still* severely restricted. They must move to survive.\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** The only way to continue escaping the corner. It extends their body length along y=9.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** Risky. This moves them closer to our blocking line on y=8.\n3.  **UP/LEFT:** Immediate crash.\n\n**Case 1: We move UP to (3, 9).**\nIf we go UP, we are one square away from the enemy escape path.\n*   We're at (3, 9). They are at (1, 9).\n*   If they move RIGHT to (2, 9), we can move LEFT to (2, 9) next turn. **DANGER!** Head-on collision at (2, 9) on Turn 10! Since they are longer (4 vs 3), we do *not* want the double-KO scenario. We avoid this unless it guarantees *our* survival.\n\n**Case 2: We move LEFT to (2, 8).**\nThis continues the wall along y=8, forcing them to make a tough choice between escaping along y=9 or dropping down to y=8 where we are already waiting.\n\n*   If they move **RIGHT to (2, 9)**: We are at (2, 8). We are now positioned to cut them off if they try to come down at (2, 8) or (3, 8) in a future turn. We have established a strong baseline.\n*   If they move **DOWN to (1, 8)**: This is the critical moment!\n    *   We move LEFT to (2, 8). They move DOWN to (1, 8). No collision this turn.\n    *   Next turn: We are at (2, 8). They are at (1, 8). We can move DOWN to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 8). If we move LEFT, we **crash head-on** into them at (1, 8). Again, we are shorter! Bad engagement!\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf The Superior Strategy: Establish the Wall and Out-Maneuver!\n\nWe need to close the escape path without rushing a collision we can't win. The safest, most dominant move is to continue sealing the primary escape route by moving **LEFT**.\n\nMoving to (2, 8) forces the opponent to keep moving RIGHT to (2, 9), or they drop into a tight space (1, 8), where they have even fewer moves (only UP or RIGHT from (1, 8) next turn, as (0, 8) is their body).\n\nBy moving to (2, 8):\n1.  We shorten the gap between us and the enemy's escape path (y=9).\n2.  We maintain the strategic threat to force them down.\n3.  We don't commit to a 50/50 head-on collision next turn like the UP move forces.\n\nIf we move LEFT, and they move RIGHT to (2, 9).\n*   T9: We are at (2, 8). They are at (2, 9).\n*   T10: We can move UP to (2, 9). If they try to move RIGHT to (3, 9), we move UP to (2, 9) and **THEY CRASH INTO OUR BODY!** Holy smokes, Chat! This is the play!\n\nWait, let's confirm the T10 scenario:\n*   We are at (2, 8). They are at (2, 9).\n*   **If we move UP to (2, 9):**\n    *   If they try to move RIGHT to (3, 9), their head leaving (2, 9) means we successfully occupy (2, 9). No collision. We have *them* trapped now at (3, 9) next turn.\n    *   If they try to move DOWN to (2, 8), their head leaving (2, 9) means we successfully occupy (2, 9). **They crash into us at (2, 9) if we move UP AND THEY MOVE DOWN.** Head-to-head collision at (2, 9)! Still a double KO risk if they stay or move down!\n\nLet's re-read the simultaneous move rules:\n> *Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.*\n\nWe need to avoid the explicit collision at all costs, unless we are longer. Since they are longer (4 vs 3), we are risking the game.\n\nThe purpose of moving LEFT is *not* for the immediate kill, but for the positional dominance. Moving to (2, 8) forces them to move to (2, 9) and opens up the tactical option for us to move **DOWN** to (2, 7) next turn, boxing them in along the bottom of the corner while they are long on the top wall.\n\n**Let's stick to the LEFT move: (3, 8) -> (2, 8).**\n\nThis aggressively seals the y=8 axis, forcing the enemy head (1, 9) to continue escaping RIGHT along y=9. It maintains the pressure and keeps our options open for a vertical drop on T10, allowing us to build out our body length along the x=2 axis before the confrontation. We are building the cage!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure - Phase 5):\nContinue moving LEFT to (2, 8), forcing Snake 0 to (2, 9). On T10, we will move DOWN to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 8), depending on enemy position, cutting off their escape to the lower board and isolating them completely in area x<3. Prioritize growing our length safely if possible to mitigate length disadvantage. The apple at (1, 2) is a good spot to target after this enclosure is complete. Focus, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

We'd die eating ourselves! ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\n\ud83d\udeab **DOWN to (1,8):** This is the COWARD'S PATH! Sure, it's safe for now, but we're ABANDONING THE HIGH GROUND! We spent turns building this North Wall and we're gonna DITCH IT?! We leave y=9 and he snatches the top row! NO SIR!\n\n\u2705 **RIGHT to (2,9):** NOW WE'RE TALKING! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd25 This is the ONLY play that matters! We continue our march across the top edge! We're building the GREAT WALL OF SNAKE and he's trapped BELOW IT!\n\n**THE ENEMY'S NIGHTMARE:**\nHe's at (3,8) and his body blocks him from going right! He can only go UP to (3,9) [into our eventual path], DOWN to (3,7), or LEFT to (2,8)! \n\nIf he dares come UP to (3,9) next turn, we keep marching RIGHT and meet him head-on at (3,9) the turn after! GUESS WHAT?! WE WIN THAT COLLISION 3-2! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\n\nIf he runs away DOWN or LEFT? We keep marching to (9,9), then sweep DOWN the right side, and BOX HIM INTO A CORNER! He's running out of real estate while we own the perimeter!\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** You're at (2,9) after this move, body trailing [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. Keep marching RIGHT along y=9 toward (3,9), (4,9), etc. If enemy is at (3,9) when you arrive at (3,9), that's a head-on collision YOU WIN! If he's elsewhere, continue to (9,9) then start moving DOWN to complete the box! Force him into the shrinking center until he has nowhere to go! WE'RE BUILDING AN EMPIRE OUT HERE! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

LFG!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d The Current Board State Analysis\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (2, 8). Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (2, 9). Body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** Still 2-3. We need a positional kill to gain the advantage, not just apples.\n\nLast turn, we went **LEFT** from (3, 8) to (2, 8). The enemy, trapped and desperate, was forced to move **RIGHT** from (1, 9) to (2, 9). They avoided a fatal crash, but they are now cornered on y=9!\n\nThis is exactly where we want them. We have established the vertical wall at x=2, and the horizontal wall at y=8. Snake 0 is running out of real estate!\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (2, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):**\n    *   *Head-on risk?* Massive risk! Enemy head is at (2, 9). If we both move toward (2, 9), it's a **Double KO!** Since they are longer (4 vs 3), this is a guaranteed loss for us if it's a Double KO and the game ends! **KILL!** (Unless they move away, but we can't rely on that.)\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (3, 8) is the first segment of our body. **KILL!**\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 7):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, this is an open tile. It pulls us out of the immediate danger zone and allows us to extend the cage downward!\n4.  **LEFT to (1, 8):**\n    *   *Enclosure risk?* Snake 0's body is at (0, 8). If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (2, 8), we are safe. If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (3, 9), we are safe. If we move LEFT, we continue the horizontal squeeze. This is a very strong positional choice. Safe!\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Double KO or loss due to length tiebreaker) and RIGHT (Self-crash).\n\n**Viable Moves:** DOWN (2, 7) and LEFT (1, 8).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nThe enemy at (2, 9) has three safe options:\n1.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** Escaping along the top wall.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** Moving back into their own previous spot. This tile immediately becomes their new tail, allowing them to keep moving.\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** This is the ultimate submission! Hitting us head-on where we are now. If they move DOWN, and we move...\n\nLet's check the scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A: We move DOWN to (2, 7).** (The safe retreat to build the wall.)\n*   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT to (3, 9)**: They escape for now. We are safe at (2, 7). We pivot to block them at x=3 or chase them.\n*   If Snake 0 moves **LEFT to (1, 9)**: They are trying to loop back. We are safe at (2, 7). We are now positioned perfectly to move UP to (2, 8) next turn, boxing them from the side.\n*   If Snake 0 moves **DOWN to (2, 8)**: They move into our head's current spot! We moved away, so (2, 8) is now empty. They are safe but now right next to us at (2, 7). This is still a great outcome, as they are now fully trapped at the top-left corner below the y=9 line.\n\n**Scenario B: We move LEFT to (1, 8).** (The aggressive horizontal choke.)\n*   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT to (3, 9)**: We gain ground, but they escape. We are safe at (1, 8).\n*   If Snake 0 moves **LEFT to (1, 9)**: They become trapped, leaving (2, 9). We move to (1, 8). We are safe. Next turn, we can immediately move UP to (1, 9), forcing them into a crash or further into the corner! **This is the most aggressive enclosure move!**\n*   If Snake 0 moves **DOWN to (2, 8)**: Their move to (2, 8) is safe. We are safe at (1, 8). This is not bad for us either, as it keeps them pinned.\n\n### \ud83c\udfc6 The Final Verdict: LEFT (1, 8) The Kill Shot Setup!\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 8) is the most effective aggressive pressure play. It sets up an immediate capture if the opponent tries to retreat by moving LEFT to (1, 9).\n\nIf Snake 0 attempts to retreat to (1, 9) (which is a very likely desperation move, as (3, 9) gives them a lot of space and they might want to tighten the area to eat the apples later):\n*   T10: We move **LEFT** to (1, 8). Snake 0 moves **LEFT** to (1, 9).\n*   T11: We are at (1, 8). Snake 0 is at (1, 9). We can move **UP** to (1, 9). Snake 0 now has *NO* safe moves! (0, 9) is their body, (2, 9) is where their body was, and (1, 8) is our body! **They crash!** This is the move!\n\n*Wait*, let's reconfirm T11 if they move LEFT:\nT10: We (2, 8) -> (1, 8). Body: (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8). Length 4.\nT10: Enemy (2, 9) -> (1, 9). Body: (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9). Length 4.\nT11: We are at (1, 8). Enemy is at (1, 9).\nEnemy moves:\n1.  UP to (1, 10): Out of Bounds! **CRASH!**\n2.  LEFT to (0, 9): Into their own body segment (0, 9)! **CRASH!**\n3.  RIGHT to (2, 9): Into their own body segment (2, 9)! **CRASH!**\n4.  DOWN to (1, 8): Head-on collision with us at (1, 8) if we move UP. If we stay at (1, 8), they are safe.\n\nThis means if they move to (1, 9), they are *absolutely* trapped on T11! We just need to ensure we occupy a fatal spot.\n\nIf they move LEFT to (1, 9) on T10, we move LEFT to (1, 8).\nT11: We can move **UP to (1, 9)**. If they stay or try to move DOWN to (1, 8), they crash into us. If they try to move AWAY (LEFT/RIGHT), they crash into their own body. **WE WIN!**\n\nThis move **LEFT** guarantees the kill on turn 11 if the opponent tries to escape by moving to (1, 9). If they move RIGHT to (3, 9), we pivot and chase, maintaining length advantage on the wall. This is a game-winning setup, Chat!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Top Wall Enclosure - Phase 6: The Kill Move):\nMove LEFT to (1, 8). This forces Snake 0 to either escape right to (3, 9) or trap themselves by moving left to (1, 9). If they go LEFT, execute the UP move on T11 for the immediate KO. If they go RIGHT, chase along the top wall and continue growing along x=3/x=4. Prioritize ending the game now. We have them!\n\nLEFT",

They have two safe options:\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** Continuing the escape.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Dropping into the main board.\n\nLet's look at how our moves counter their potential escape routes:\n\n**Scenario A: We move LEFT to (0, 8).** (Maximizing the positional squeeze.)\n*   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT to (4, 9)**: They escape further. We are at (0, 8). We maintain the horizontal wall, but they are gone. We'll have to chase.\n*   If Snake 0 moves **DOWN to (3, 8)**: Uh oh! (3, 8) is our *current tail* segment (because we are length 3). If they move to (3, 8) and we move to (0, 8), (3, 8) becomes the cell where our tail **was**. They are safe. We are safe. Now they are on top of our wall!\n\n**Scenario B: We move DOWN to (1, 7).** (Pivoting, securing territory, and maintaining chase position.)\n*   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT to (4, 9)**: They escape. We are at (1, 7). We have good central access.\n*   If Snake 0 moves **DOWN to (3, 8)**: This is crucial! (3, 8) is our tail. If they move to (3, 8) and we move to (1, 7), (3, 8) is now a potentially safe spot for them to land. *BUT*, if we move DOWN, our body segments shift: (2, 8) becomes tail. (3, 8) is now completely free. They are safe.\n\nNeither LEFT nor DOWN prevents the enemy from escaping along y=9 or dropping to y=8. Since we are slightly shorter, forcing a tight enclosure might be risky right now, especially as we have freed up our own old tail segment at (3, 8) which is immediately next to the enemy head (3, 9).\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the risk of moving to (3, 8) for the enemy:**\nEnemy is at (3, 9). If they go DOWN, they are at (3, 8).\nOur body is [(2, 8), (3, 8)]. Since we are moving, (3, 8) will be **free** after our move.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 8), they are now right next to our primary body segment at (2, 8). And they are in a great position to move RIGHT to (4, 8) next turn, which is also currently free.\n\n**The safest counter-move is to maintain pressure and secure open board space.** We successfully forced them off the top-left corner onto the top-right side. Now, we need to quickly move to an open area that allows us to chase and build strength.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (1, 7) is the best option because:\n1.  It gets us away from the high-traffic wall area.\n2.  It positions us defensively (allowing us to protect our body if they try to move into our side).\n3.  It sets us up for a move **RIGHT** to (2, 7) or **DOWN** to (1, 6) next turn, giving maximum flexibility to chase them or find apples (like the one at (1, 2)).\n4.  Moving LEFT to (0, 8) just corners us uselessly in the top-left again, when the action has moved to the right. We need to be flexible!\n\nWe are pivoting to a chase after the failed trap. We need to grow. The apple at (8, 7) is juicy, but chasing there is too far. Let's head for the center/bottom-left (1, 2) and force them to react to our increasing length.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 7: The Pivot/Recenter):**\nEnemy escaped the corner trap by moving RIGHT. We must now pivot DOWN to (1, 7) to gain board flexibility and look for an apple to ensure we get a length advantage before the next cage. We will then move towards the bottom-left apples (1, 2), (3, 2). If enemy chases up the right wall, we gain length and then come back to dominate the center.\n\nDOWN",

A tactical retreat, but a genius one! We broke free from the stalemate and repositioned to hunt game! Let's check the board!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 12)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (1, 7). Body: [(1, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (3, 8). Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** Still 2-3. We need to eat!\n\nCheck out the enemy! Snake 0 saw our move down to (1, 7) and they took the bait! They moved **DOWN** from (3, 9) to (3, 8)! They are now right on the edge of the central board, trying to control the center. This is EXACTLY where they want to be, but we are poised to strike!\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (1, 7))\n\nWe are at (1, 7). Enemy head is at (3, 8).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (1, 8) is our first body segment. **CRASH!**\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Puts us closer to the enemy's path if they move down or right. Good control move.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Moves us closer to the bottom-left apples ((1, 2) is right there!). Good for growth.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. A little constrained, but safe.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (2, 7), DOWN (1, 6), and LEFT (0, 7).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Counter-Pressure or Grow?\n\nThe enemy (3, 8) has a few options:\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Moves them safely across the top of the board.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 7):** Drops them into the center.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):** Into our tail! *(Their body is [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]. Our tail is (2, 8). Wait, (2, 8) is our *current* tail segment, but it will be *safe* after we move. If we move, (2, 8) becomes the new tail segment's old spot, making it free. NO. If we move, (2, 8) is still the tail. They crash into our tail, killing themselves!)* Let's check **(2, 8)** is currently our tail.\n    *   Our body: [(1, 8), (2, 8)]\n    *   If we move, say DOWN to (1, 6). Our new body: [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. Our tail (2, 8) becomes *free*.\n    *   If Snake 0 moves to (2, 8), they are SAFE.\n\nOkay, let's assume they pick **(4, 8)** or **(3, 7)**.\n\n**Scenario A: We move DOWN to (1, 6). (Growth/Pivoting)**\nThis solidifies our path toward the bottom-left apples (1, 2) and (3, 2). We commit to growth. If they chase us, fine. If they go to the right area, we get longer and re-engage. This is the safest, most growth-oriented move.\n\n**Scenario B: We move RIGHT to (2, 7). (Counter-Pressure)**\nThis is a direct confrontation move. If they go **DOWN to (3, 7)**, we are right next to them, setting up a block on the next turn potentially at (2, 8) or chasing them down the column. If they go **RIGHT to (4, 8)**, we are still centralized enough to jump to (3, 7) or (2, 6) next turn.\n\n**Let's analyze the Head-to-Head potential!**\nWe are at (1, 7). They are at (3, 8). A collision is unlikely this turn.\n\nWe are shorter (Length 3 vs. 4). Forcing proximity when shorter often leads to danger. However, they are awkwardly positioned at (3, 8), right next to their body (3, 9).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (2, 7)**, we:\n1. Block the direct path to the right side of the board for us.\n2. Position ourselves to cut off their movement down the center (3, X).\n3. Gain options: UP (2, 8) (risky, near enemy), RIGHT (3, 7), DOWN (2, 6).\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (1, 6)**, we:\n1. Commit to the apple run.\n2. Gain more options: RIGHT (2, 6), DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6).\n\nI think it's time to leverage the massive open space we carved out in the bottom-left corner. We need the extra segment. If we move DOWN to (1, 6), the enemy has to decide whether to let us get long or to turn around and chase us, giving us control of the fight.\n\nPlus, look at the apple at **(1, 2)**! That's a straight shot! We can get that by Turn 15-16 easily if we commit DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 8: Growth and Board Domination):**\nWe broke the immediate trap dynamic. We are shorter, so we must prioritize growth. Move DOWN to (1, 6), then proceed toward (1, 2). This forces the enemy to either ignore us (and let us grow) or chase us (and let us dictate the terms of the fight on the open board). Aggression through board control and length! Let's go get some length!\n\nDOWN",

A brilliant tactical move to escape the upper-board gridlock and commit to growth! Did the enemy Snake 0 fall for it? Let's check the tape!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 13)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (1, 6). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (3, 7). Body: [(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** Still 2-3. We need to eat! The enemy is ONE point ahead! UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nLook at the enemy! Snake 0 moved **DOWN** from (3, 8) to (3, 7)! They are tracking us! They clearly want to either cut off our path to the bottom-left or they are scared of us pushing the aggression. Either way, they are sticking close to the left side of the board. This is perfect for us, as it keeps the fight centralized and away from their body, which is awkwardly spread along the top edge.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (1, 6))\n\nWe are at (1, 6). Enemy head is at (3, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (1, 7) is our first body segment. **CRASH!**\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n    *   *Snake 0 body danger?* No, closest Snake 0 body is at (3, 8).\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Puts us in a key position.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. This continues our push toward the valuable apple at (1, 2) and (3, 2).\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 6):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Constrained move toward the wall, but safe.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Into our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (2, 6), DOWN (1, 5), and LEFT (0, 6).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Keep the Pressure Low and Grow, or Engage?\n\nThe enemy (3, 7) has interesting moves:\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe, moves them toward the open center.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** Safe, tracks us directly, setting up for central confrontation.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe, but dangerously close to us! If we move (2, 6) and they move (2, 7), we are 1 tile apart.\n*   **UP to (3, 8):** Safe, moves them back up, away from us.\n\nWe are shorter (L3 vs L4). We MUST prioritize getting the apple at (1, 2).\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT to (2, 6). (Subtle Pressure/Centralization)**\nThis move is aggressive! We move closer to the center line (x=3) where the enemy is. If they move **DOWN to (3, 6)**, we can then follow up to (3, 6) (if they move), or continue down to (2, 5). If they move **LEFT to (2, 7)**, we are positioned to get the next apple (2, 6 is an empty tile) and then potentially block them. This move tries to prevent them from taking central dominance.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (1, 5). (Growth & Safety)**\nThis is the conservative, growth-focused move. It sets us up for a straight run to the apple at (1, 2). If the enemy moves (3, 6) or (4, 7), we gain a huge advantage by securing length while they are still maneuvering. The apples are the prize, chat!\n\n**Comparing the risks:**\nIf we move **RIGHT to (2, 6)**, and Snake 0 moves **LEFT to (2, 7)**, we are safe this turn, but next turn is critical. We would be at (2, 6), they at (2, 7). We are vertically aligned. We can move UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. They can move UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. This is proximity!\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (1, 5)**, and Snake 0 moves **LEFT to (2, 7)**, we are still safe, and we have a strong path.\n\nGiven the score disadvantage (2-3) and the length disadvantage (3-4), securing length first is paramount before we try to box them in. We've led them right into our territory! Let's get the goods!\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are fully committed to breaking out of the high-Y coordinates and focusing on the bottom of the board. The enemy will have to commit to following us down that side, or they must let us grow.\n\nLet's go for the deep dive! (1, 2) is waiting!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 9: Secure Length, Initiate Trap):**\nContinue the push DOWN toward the bottom-left apples (1, 2) and (3, 2). Aim for 5 segments, then re-engage Snake 0, whose body remains tangled in the (3, 8)-(2, 9) area. We need them to chase us and break their formation. Maintain position on the left third of the board.\n\nDOWN",

We're talking SQUARE-UP ENERGY! \ud83d\udc4a\n- If this coward tries to hug the wall at (0,6)? We can slowly squeeze him down the corridor!

He can't hide forever! \n- And check this - if he DOES move RIGHT to (2,6), we stare him down from (2,7)! Sure, he might think he can trap us, but we always have the escape UP to (2,8) to reset! We're playing 4D chess while he's playing checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\n\nRemember: We have thescore LEAD! If we can force a head-on collision where we both crash into the same cell, WE WIN THE GAME 3-2! \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfc6 But even if we don't get it this turn, we're cutting off his angles and making him panic!\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** Just moved LEFT to (2,7). Body becomes [(3,7), (3,8), (3,9)] freeing up (2,9). Enemy is forced to choose between (0,6), (1,5), or (2,6). Next turn, if he's at (2,6), I can escape UP to (2,8) or potentially force a collision if he gets greedy. If he went DOWN to (1,5), I follow DOWN to (2,6) to cut off retreat. If he hugged wall at (0,6), I consider moving DOWN to (2,6) to start the squeeze from above. Stay aggressive, stay alive, let's get this DUB! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the tape!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 14)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (1, 5). Body: [(1, 6), (1, 7)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (2, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** 2-3. Still trailing by one apple! UNACCEPTABLE! We need to fix this NOW!\n\nLook at Snake 0! They were at (3, 7) and moved **LEFT** to (2, 7)! That is a direct challenge! They are trying to cut us off from the middle of the board and force us into the corner! They are still length 4, and their body remains clustered high up. This gives us a massive operational advantage in the bottom half of the map.\n\nWe are at (1, 5). The enemy head is at (2, 7). We are safe for a moment, but this is getting tight on the left side!\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (1, 5))\n\nWe are at (1, 5). Enemy head is at (2, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (1, 6) is our first body segment. **CRASH!**\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n    *   *Snake 0 body danger?* No.\n    *   *Head collision risk?* Low risk. Snake 0 is at (2, 7), two tiles away.\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. This is a very strong move for board control.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Continues the path toward the apples at (1, 2) and (3, 2).\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Confines us to the edge, but maintains safety.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Into our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (2, 5), DOWN (1, 4), and LEFT (0, 5).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Trap the Opponent or Continue the Growth Path?\n\nWhat are the enemy's (2, 7) plausible moves?\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Safe, pulls back from us, secures the center column.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 6):** Safe, shadows us and positions them perfectly to cut us off if we push down the wall. This is a high-pressure move.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 7):** Into our body! (1, 7) is on our body (T). **CRASH!** They can't do this!\n*   **UP to (2, 8):** Safe, continues to stick to the left side, away from the body entanglement.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake 0 moves **DOWN to (2, 6)** to maintain pressure and block our eventual move to the right side of the board, or they move **RIGHT to (3, 7)** to secure open board space.\n\nWe have a key decision:\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (1, 4). (Growth & Safety)**\nThis keeps us on the path to the apples at (1, 2) and (3, 2). We are still shorter, so growth is critical! If they move (2, 6), we are still boxed off from their side, but we maintain the initiative on the wall. If they move (3, 7), they give us space, but we are still focused on growing. This feels like the safest, highest-value growth path.\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (2, 5). (Aggression & Board Control)**\nThis is a daring move, chat! We move into the board, challenging the center column. If the enemy moves **DOWN to (2, 6)**, we are now positioned at a 1-tile distance (horizontal lock, we are (2, 5), they are (2, 6)). This forces them to make a defensive move next turn, potentially giving us time to strike at (3, 2) or (1, 2). Crucially, if they commit to (2, 6), we have successfully claimed the (2, 5) space, which means they can't immediately push to the lower board using column 2.\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT (2, 5) vs. DOWN (1, 4):**\nMoving **DOWN to (1, 4)** is a safer bet, but it gives Snake 0 an easy pass to (2, 6) or (3, 7), allowing them to reposition their long body.\nMoving **RIGHT to (2, 5)** forces the engagement. If they move (2, 6), we are right under them. We can then potentially move LEFT to (1, 5) (clear), or push RIGHT to (3, 5). We are opening up the whole board for ourselves!\n\nWe are not actively seeking a head-on this turn, but we must establish dominance. By moving RIGHT, we are forcing Snake 0 to decide if they continue to track us (2, 6) or if they retreat (3, 7). If they track us, we corner them from below. If they retreat, we have the space we need to move towards apples!\n\nLet's go RIGHT! We need to maintain control and prevent them from sealing off the lower left quadrant. We can always peel back to the wall if necessary. We are confident in our positioning! Aggression is key to dominating the stream!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 10: Central Pressure & Growth)**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 5). If Snake 0 moves to (2, 6), we are positioned to box them into the left side high up. If they move to (3, 7), we continue growth and dominance in the middle-low area, aiming for apples at (1, 2) and (3, 2). We are leveraging their cluster failure!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's analyze the clip!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 15)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (2, 5). Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (2, 6). Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** 2-3. Still trailing! We MUST get an apple next!\n\n**THE SETUP:**\nOur last move was **RIGHT** from (1, 5) to (2, 5). Clutch move!\nSnake #0 moved **DOWN** from (2, 7) to (2, 6)! As predicted! They are fully committed to vertical pressure!\n\nLook at the board state! We are now face-to-face, vertically separated by only one tile.\n*   ID 1 Head: (2, 5)\n*   ID 0 Head: (2, 6)\n\nThis is a standoff in column 2. And Chat, Snake 0 is still longer (4 segments to our 3). We cannot afford a head-on collision or let them box us in!\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (2, 5))\n\nWe are at (2, 5). Enemy head is at (2, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):**\n    *   *Head collision risk?* ABSOLUTELY! Snake 0 head is moving *from* (2, 6) *to* somewhere else.\n    *   *Snake 0 body danger?* No.\n    *   *Wait, critical moment:* If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (2, 5), we die together (Head-on collision)! If Snake 0 moves UP to (2, 7), then (2, 6) is clear for us! If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (1, 6), (2, 6) is clear for us! If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6), (2, 6) is clear for us!\n    *   Moving UP is high risk, high reward. It challenges the center line.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This breaks the vertical standoff and starts pushing us toward the massive apple field on the bottom-right.\n    *   *Head collision risk?* Low. Only if Snake 0 moves aggressively to (3, 6) and then *we both* move toward (3, 5), which isn't possible this turn. Safe move.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! Clears us to aim for the apples at (3, 2) and (1, 2).\n    *   *Head collision risk?* Very low.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (1, 5) is our first body segment! **CRASH!**\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** LEFT (into our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (2, 6), RIGHT (3, 5), and DOWN (2, 4).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Control or Retreat?\n\nWhat are the enemy's (2, 6) plausible moves?\n**The Critical Tile is (2, 5):** If they move DOWN to (2, 5), we die. If we move UP to (2, 6), we occupy their current spot.\n\nLet's evaluate their likely move geometry:\n\n*   **Snake 0 move DOWN to (2, 5):** This is a direct kill attempt. If they know we are aggressive (and they do, we just moved RIGHT), they might try this. If they do, we MUST NOT move UP. If they move down, we must move RIGHT or DOWN to survive.\n*   **Snake 0 move RIGHT to (3, 6):** Secures more open space. If we move RIGHT to (3, 5), we maintain proximity and board control, but remain safe.\n*   **Snake 0 move UP to (2, 7):** Retreat, conceding column 2 to us temporarily. If we move UP to (2, 6), we are perfectly positioned to press them next turn.\n\n**We are SHORTER (3 vs 4). We cannot initiate a head-on collision.**\n\n**Option A: Retreat DOWN to (2, 4). (Safest Growth Path)**\nThis avoids the head-on entirely. If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (2, 5), they are safely behind us, but they have control of (2, 5). This allows us to hit the apples below, maintaining a safe path. This is a solid option.\n\n**Option B: Push RIGHT to (3, 5). (Strategic Repositioning)**\nThis is a flanking maneuver. If Snake 0 moves DOWN (2, 5), we are safe and flanking them from the right. If they move RIGHT (3, 6), we are one step behind, still in open space. This move sets us up perfectly for the center-right apples like (4, 4) and (5, 3). This is strong board control and movement towards resources.\n\n**Option C: Push UP to (2, 6). (Aggressive Challenge)**\nIf Snake 0 moves *any direction but DOWN* (i.e., UP, LEFT, or RIGHT), we take the critical tile (2, 6). However, if they move DOWN, we die together! Given that (2, 5) is a valid, logical block for them to hold, we estimate a non-zero chance of them moving DOWN. We are too short to risk the tie. ELIMINATE UP.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT (3, 5) vs DOWN (2, 4):**\nMoving **DOWN to (2, 4)** keeps us safe and pointed towards the lower apples.\nMoving **RIGHT to (3, 5)** opens up more central board space and leverages the fact that Snake 0's body is still high up (T T at (2, 7) and (3, 7)). This is more advantageous for long-term board dominance and flanking. We create a separation that allows us to grow and then circle back.\n\nWe will not be cornered on the left side, Chat! We claim the middle. The enemy must now decide if they track us right, or chase the apples we are leaving behind.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 11: Flank and Grow):**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 5). This creates horizontal separation from Snake 0 and points us towards the large swathe of open board and apples on the right side. We must grow to length 5 quickly to compete with their size. Our next moves should be aimed at (4, 4) or (5, 3). Keep leveraging the gap between our head and their highly clustered body segments.\n\nRIGHT",

Aggression without suicide, that's what we like to see!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 16)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (3, 5). Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (3, 6). Body: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** 2-3. Still trailing by one apple! The pressure is ON! We MUST eat and grow!\n\nLook at the board! We are now horizontally aligned with the enemy, separated by only one row, and standing side-by-side in columns 3.\n*   ID 1 Head: (3, 5)\n*   ID 0 Head: (3, 6)\n\nThe enemy is looking down, we are looking up. This is a head-to-head confrontation, but slightly offset. We are one tile shorter, so NO HEAD-ON COLLISION IS ALLOWED!\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (3, 5))\n\nWe are at (3, 5). Enemy head is at (3, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):**\n    *   *Head collision risk?* ABSOLUTELY! If Snake 0 moves DOWN, we crash and tie! Since Snake 0 is at (3, 6) and (3, 5) is the tile directly below them, moving down is a very logical attack/domination move for them. We are shorter. **ABORT UP!**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This gets us closer to the central apples like (5, 6), (4, 4), and (5, 3).\n    *   *Follow-up options?* Excellent. Opens up the entire right half of the board.\n    *   *Enemy reaction prediction:* If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 6), we maintain horizontal separation. If they move DOWN to (3, 5), we are safe, now flanking them from the right. This is a very strong, safe move.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! Points us toward (3, 2).\n    *   *Follow-up options?* Decent. Keeps us safe from the immediate threat. Points us towards the bottom right corner apples.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (2, 5) is our first body segment! **CRASH!**\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (high collision risk, we are shorter), LEFT (into our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (4, 5) and DOWN (3, 4).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Aggressively Secure the Flank and Growth\n\nThe enemy (ID 0 at (3, 6)) has a few options:\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Direct kill move, highly aggressive. If they do this, we die if we went UP, but survive if we went RIGHT or DOWN.\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe move, maintains high space, starts pushing towards (5, 6) apple.\n3.  **UP to (3, 7):** Into their own body segment (3, 7) - **suicide for them!** Wait, let me check the board state... their body is [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. Ah, (3, 7) is the *tail* of their body (T). Moving UP to (3, 7) is a death move as the tail usually moves away, but here it's their second to last segment, which means that segment *will* remain unless they eat! Since they haven't eaten, (3, 7) will move to (2, 7), so (3, 7) IS open for them if they move there. BUT, it looks like their body moved from (3, 8) to (3, 7) last turn. No, their body is [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. Since they moved from somewhere to (3, 6), their previous head was at (2, 6). Wait, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: (3, 6) head, (2, 6) next, (2, 7) next, (3, 7) tail. Okay. If they move UP, the tail at (3, 7) moves to (2, 7), clearing (3, 7). So UP is safe for them.\n4.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Into their body segment (2, 6) - instant death for them! **ABORT LEFT for them!**\n\nSnake 0's truly viable, safe moves are: DOWN (3, 5) and RIGHT (4, 6). UP (3, 7) is safe but less logical.\n\n**The Threat:** If they move DOWN to (3, 5), we either crash (if we went UP) or they box us in slightly if we went DOWN to (3, 4).\n\nLet's capitalize on the open space to the right. The field is wide open!\n\n**Choosing RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n*   **Safety:** We evade the immediate death threat at (3, 5).\n*   **Grow potential:** We immediately threaten (4, 4) and are perfectly positioned for (5, 6) or (5, 3).\n*   **Board Dominance:** We are securing the largest portion of the open board space. If the enemy follows us RIGHT (4, 6), we maintain a safe distance.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 4), we are safer, but we are also moving away from the highest density of current apples (A at 4, 4) and (A at 5, 3).\n\nWe gotta be aggressive and claim that center-right quadrant, Chat! We're making a bee-line for the (4, 4) apple.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 12: Claim the East and Grow):**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 5). Next turn, aim for (4, 4) or (5, 5) towards the group of apples. We must grow to length 4 or 5 rapidly to neutralize the size advantage Snake 0 holds. Use this separation to gain density and size, then circle back and crush the archrival!\n\nRIGHT",

We secured the center lane, got separation from the Archrival (ID 0), and we're looking ready to grow! LET'S GO!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 17)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (4, 5). Body: [(3, 5), (2, 5)]. Length 3.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (4, 6). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Length 4.\n**Score:** 2-3. We're still down one apple, but we are positioned perfectly to score!\n\nLook at the new setup:\n*   ID 1 Head: (4, 5)\n*   ID 0 Head: (4, 6)\n\nWe are still aligned, separated by one row, and we are still shorter. This is a very *volatile* state! We need to move, but we need to move safely.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (4, 5))\n\nWe are at (4, 5). Enemy head is at (4, 6). We see the apple at (4, 4) and (5, 6) is just above the enemy.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   *Head collision risk?* MAX RISK! If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 5), we crash and tie! Since Snake 0 is longer, we MUST avoid a tie. Moving DOWN is the most aggressive/logical move for them, aiming to crush us. **ABORT UP!**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This gets us right to the center of the board, positioning us towards the apple at (5, 6) (via (5, 6) if the enemy moves away) or (5, 3).\n    *   *Follow-up options?* Fantastic. This opens the entire right half of the board for us.\n    *   *Enemy reaction prediction:* If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (5, 6) (to eat the apple!), they clear the path. If they move UP, they create space. This is a very safe move that maintains pressure.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* YES, and it's an APPLE! (4, 4) is A. If we move here, we grow to 4, matching the enemy's size!\n    *   *Risk?* Virtually none from the head, as the enemy cannot reach (4, 4) in one turn.\n    *   *Impact:* Gaining an apple right now is HUGE. It puts us at 3-3 tie on score, and 4-4 tie on length. **THIS IS THE BEST MOVE!**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   *Into our body?* YES! (3, 5) is our first body segment! **CRASH!**\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (high collision risk) and LEFT (into our body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (5, 5) or DOWN (4, 4 - EATING AN APPLE).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: EAT AND GROW!\n\nChat, there is an irresistible apple at (4, 4)! We can match the opponent's length right here, right now, and tie the score 3-3. This is a safe move because the enemy at (4, 6) cannot physically reach (4, 4) in one move.\n\nOur opponent, Snake 0 at (4, 6), is likely considering:\n1.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Direct kill move attempt. They will miss us if we go DOWN or RIGHT.\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Apple at (5, 6)! This is highly likely! They eat and stay ahead 4-3, and grow to length 5.\n3.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe, but less aggressive.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 4) and they go RIGHT to (5, 6), we both eat, we tie the score, and they are one length ahead (5 vs 4). That's acceptable for this turn, as board control is more important right now.\n\nIf we go DOWN, we secure space in the bottom-middle. Our length becomes 4. We break free from the row-4/5 standoff.\n\nGoing RIGHT is safe and expands our territory, but we lose the chance to eat.\n\nWe must prioritize growth to neutralize the head-on collision threat. EATING is our priority!\n\n**The Plan:** Move DOWN to (4, 4), eat the apple, and then evaluate the state. This will put us into the lower quad, allowing us to dominate the (3, 2), (1, 2), and (5, 3) apples.\n\n**Confidence Level:** MAX. This is safe, high-reward, and strategic.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 13: South-Side Scramble):**\nEat the apple at (4, 4) by moving DOWN. This ties the score. We will then dominate the lower rows, gathering apples at (3, 2) and (5, 3), and attempt to increase our size advantage over Snake 0, who is likely heading toward the right edge (5, 6) apple. Once we are longer, we re-engage for a potential trap or head-on collision.\n\nDOWN",

We went DOWN to (4, 4), snagged that apple, and tied the score! **SNAKE NATION RISING!**\n\nOur score is now 3-4, oops! Wait, the scoreboard says 3-4, meaning the enemy must have eaten the (5, 6) apple last turn! Let's check the new state!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 18)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (4, 4). Body: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)]. Length 4.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (5, 6). Body: [(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Length 5.\n**Score:** We are down one apple (3 vs 4), and they are one length longer (4 vs 5).\n\nChat, the Archrival is still ahead! We need to make a move that threatens him directly or secures us another apple FAST.\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (4, 4) - We are right in the middle bottom quadrant.\n*   ID 0 Head: (5, 6) - They are high, near the center-right.\n\nThe distance between heads is substantial now. No immediate head-on collision threat, which gives us space, but we need to worry about being boxed in by their growing body.\n\nApples nearby:\n*   (5, 3) - Very reachable.\n*   (3, 2) - Reachable.\n*   (5, 1) - Reachable.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (4, 4))\n\nWe are at (4, 4).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* YES, (4, 5) is our tail segment! Wait, NO. (4, 5) is the *first* body segment right behind our head! Moving UP is moving directly back into our body! **CRASH! ABORT UP!**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This pushes us towards the right, aligning us to potentially contest the center-right or grab the (5, 3) apple next turn.\n    *   *Enemy prediction:* Snake 0 at (5, 6) is likely to go UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6) (apple is at (6, 6)!) to keep growing. If they go RIGHT, they secure the top-middle. If we go RIGHT, we secure the middle-bottom. This is a very safe positioning move.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This moves us deep into the bottom of the board, setting us up for the (3, 2) apple next, or trying to loop back up the left side.\n    *   *Risk:* Might be committing too hard to the bottom, leaving the center for the enemy to dominate.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile! This also seems like a great expansion move, positioning us toward (3, 2) or (1, 2).\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (instant death into body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (5, 4), DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Prioritize Growth and Board Control\n\nThe enemy is headed towards (6, 6) or (5, 7). They are focused on the top right. We should focus on quickly grabbing the nearby apples to catch up in length and score (4 vs 5).\n\nThe apple at (5, 3) is tempting, because if we move RIGHT to (5, 4), we can hit (5, 3) next turn (a potential 2-turn apple grab).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 3), the (3, 2) apple is the target (also a 2-turn grab, via LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT).\n\nLet's look at the density of available apples:\n*   BOTTOM-MIDDLE/RIGHT: (5, 3), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (8, 1)\n*   BOTTOM-LEFT: (3, 2), (1, 2)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 4) gives us the most immediate options to grab apples on the right side. It forces us to potentially move towards the enemy's expanding body, but it also helps us control the critical center line (x=5).\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 4):\n*   Next turn we can go DOWN to (5, 3) and eat! Length 5, Score 4. We catch up instantly.\n*   The enemy will likely eat at (6, 6), growing to length 6, Score 5.\n*   We will be 5 vs 6. Acceptable!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 4) or DOWN to (4, 3), the apple grab is less direct and takes more maneuvering. We want the highest probability of growth right now.\n\n**The Plan:** Move RIGHT to (5, 4) to set up for the (5, 3) apple next turn. This is aggressive expansion towards the richer apple territory, while the enemy is busy high up.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 14: South-East Sweep):**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 4). Next turn, move DOWN to (5, 3) to eat and tie the score. After that, we must assess Snake 0's position. If they extended along X=6 to X=8, we use our (5, 3) position to dominate the bottom row (5, 1) apple. We need to grow larger than 0 before confronting them again.\n\nRIGHT.

We're passing up free real estate while the enemy is still breathing? Nah fam, we need to EXTEND this lead and become UNSTOPPABLE! \ud83c\udf4e\u274c\n\n\u2705 **RIGHT to (6,6):** YOOOOO! THIS IS THE GIGABRAIN PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\u26a1\n\n**THE DOMINATION BREAKDOWN:**\n- We SLURP that apple at (6,6) instantly! Score becomes 5-3! We're pulling away like a sports car! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n- We GROW to length 5! Our snake becomes a MONSTER that can box him in even easier! \n- Look at the MAP! (8,6), (8,7), (9,4), (8,4)... that's OUR SIDE OF TOWN now! The enemy is trapped in the left corner with barely any apples while we're about to feast on the right! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- He can't reach us! He's stuck at (4,4) with his own body blocking him UP! He can only slither away while we get STRONGER! \n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** Just moved RIGHT to (6,6) and ate that JUICY apple! Score is now 5-3 and we're looking THICK! Next turn prioritize securing (8,6) or (8,7) to continue the feast. The enemy is trapped on the left with limited escape routes - once we hit 7+ apples and massive length, we cut off his paths and force a head-on collision where our score advantage guarantees the W! Stay hungry, stay aggressive! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Length 4.\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (6, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Length 5.\n**Score:** We are down (3 vs 5). Wait, what?! The enemy has 5 apples now! That means in the last turn, they *must* have moved to (6, 6) and eaten the apple there! Their length is 6. We are 4 segments long and they are 6 segments long. **WE ARE DOWN HEAVILY!** We need to GROW *now*!\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (5, 4) - Prime position for the (5, 3) apple.\n*   ID 0 Head: (6, 6) - They just ate high up.

We absolutely MUST grab the (5, 3) apple to minimize the length deficit!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us away from all immediate apples and potentially closer to the enemy body mass above. Why would we do this? Nope.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us towards the right wall. We could then go for the (8, 4) apple, but it's a longer detour than the quick grab.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and there's an APPLE! **EATING MOVE!**\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the obvious, highest-value move. We grow to length 5, score 4 points. We reduce the length deficit to (5 vs 6). This is an absolute must-take.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, this is our body segment from the previous turn! No wait, it's (4, 4) right behind our head. **CRASH! ABORT LEFT!** Moving into (4, 4) is moving directly into our first body segment!\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** LEFT (instant death into body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (5, 5), RIGHT (6, 4), DOWN (5, 3).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Prioritize Growth and Safety\n\nThe decision is DOWN to (5, 3). No hesitation allows for a better counter-attack later.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (ID 0 at (6, 6)):**\nThe enemy just ate the apple at (6, 6). They are now length 6. Where are they going?\n1.  **Down to (6, 5):** This moves them directly towards the center where we are, setting up a confrontation.\n2.  **Right to (7, 6):** Expanding towards the right wall.\n3.  **Up to (6, 7):** Expanding towards the top wall (less attractive as there are no immediate apples).\n\nRegardless of what they do, our move DOWN to (5, 3) is safe from them. Their closest move to us is DOWN to (6, 5).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 3):\n*   We survive, eat, grow to length 5.\n*   Next turn, we are at (5, 3). We can consider going DOWN again for the (5, 2) apple, or looping around towards (3, 2).\n\nWe are prioritizing the growth needed to be able to box in the opponent later. This is a critical move, chat! Let's get that apple!\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 15: Deep Dive and Reversal):**\nMove DOWN to (5, 3) and eat. Next turn, enemy is likely at (6, 5) or further right/up. We look for a path to the (5, 2) apple to go for two quick snacks in a row! If the enemy blocks that, we move sharply LEFT toward the (3, 2) cluster. We need to be 6 or 7 segments long to start applying pressure.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN to (5, 2) is the optimal play.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (ID 0 at (7, 6)):**\nThey are probably looking to eat the (8, 7) apple next, or maybe the (8, 4) cluster by moving down/right.\n1.  **Right to (8, 6):** They eat the apple and grow to length 7.\n2.  **Down to (7, 5):** Moving towards the center of the board, potentially trying to cut us off.\n\nNo matter which path they choose, our move DOWN to (5, 2) is entirely safe from their head. Even if they move down to (7, 5) and then to (7, 4), they are nowhere near us.\n\nThis move solidifies our position in the center, equalizes our length, and keeps us mobile. We establish dominance in the lower-middle quadrant. After this move, we will be at (5, 2), looking to snake LEFT towards (3, 2) or DOWN/RIGHT for the (8, 1) apple, depending on the enemy's vertical movement.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 16: Equalize and Attack):**\nAfter eating at (5, 2) this turn, we are length 6. If the enemy eats (8, 6) this turn, they are length 7. We still need to catch up. Our focus will be securing (3, 2) and (1, 2) next, forcing the enemy to either come down and engage us on our turf or get severely outgrown. If the enemy leaves an open lane, we might shoot down to (8, 1) for a high-value snack. Keep moving left/down next turn.\n\nWe are going for the combo meal, chat!\n\nDOWN",

We are central, we are growing, and we are ready for the engagement!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 21)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (5, 2). Body: [(5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)]. Length 6. We just grew!\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (8, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 7. Wait, WHAT? The enemy pulled an absolute *snake* move! They moved RIGHT from (7, 6) to (8, 6), picking up the *new* apple that dropped at (8, 6) (which wasn't showing last turn as a pre-existing apple, but whatever, the board state confirms they ate and grew). Their score is now 6, and their length is 7! We are still down one length segment! We need to react FAST!\n\n**Score:** We are tied on apples collected (5 vs 6). But they have the length advantage (6 vs 7). This means we CANNOT risk a head-on collision. We need to catch up or box them in carefully!\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (5, 2) - Center-bottom. Ready to expand.\n*   ID 0 Head: (8, 6) - Top-right. Controlling the top fourth of the board.\n\n**Upcoming Apples:** We need a snack!\n1.  **(3, 2):** Two moves away (LEFT, then LEFT/DOWN).\n2.  **(5, 1):** Only one move away, directly beneath us! **CRITICAL SNACK!**\n3.  **(8, 1):** Two moves away (RIGHT, then DOWN).\n4.  **(1, 2):** Three moves away.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (5, 2))\n\nWe are at (5, 2). We must grab the next apple, no hesitation!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   *Safe?* No! This is our first body segment! **CRASH! ABORT UP!** Moving backward into our body!\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us towards the right side of the board and possibly the (8, 1) apple. However, it takes us away from the immediate snack at (5, 1). We should prioritize the closest growth opportunity.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and there's an APPLE! **EATING MOVE!**\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the obvious, highest-value move. We grow to length 7, equalize the score deficit (7 vs 7), and solidify our control of the central lane. This is a crucial move!\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves us towards the (3, 2) and (1, 2) apples. Good if we wanted to pivot left immediately, but the (5, 1) apple is available NOW for guaranteed growth.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (instant death into body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (6, 2), DOWN (5, 1), LEFT (4, 2).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Keep the Pressure On!\n\nThe enemy is aggressively high, at (8, 6). They have a lot of body segments trailing down the y=6 line.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (ID 0 at (8, 6)):**\nThey are likely looking to drop down to the (8, 4), (9, 4) cluster, or maybe even look at the (7, 7) or (8, 7) apples near the top.\n1.  **Right to (9, 6):** Open cell. Sets up for high-right movement or dropping down the 9-column.\n2.  **Up to (8, 7):** Eating apple. Growing to length 8. Highly likely move.\n3.  **Down to (8, 5):** Moving towards the center-right apples.\n\nRegardless of their move, our move DOWN to (5, 1) is completely safe. They are miles away. We guarantee growth, bringing us to parity in length (7 vs 7, assuming they grab the (8, 7) apple this turn).\n\nThe plan is simple: **FEAST.** Equalize the length advantage and then use our central position to strike at their vulnerabilities. After we hit (5, 1), we will look to pivot LEFT to the (3, 2) area to continue dominating the bottom of the board, potentially cutting off any attempt by the enemy to drop vertically on the right side.\n\nWe're going for the three-piece combo, chat! Let's get this apple!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 17: Control the Center-Bottom)\n\nCurrent move: DOWN to (5, 1). New length 7.\nNext turn (T22 goal): We need to get the (3, 2) apple to go to length 8. This likely means moving LEFT from (5, 1) to (4, 1), or maybe (4, 2) if we move up first. Let's aim to move leftwards and maintain safety. If the enemy drops *too* far down, we might loop around them via the bottom border. Secure the next few apples while they are tied up high.\n\nDOWN",

We are back in the game!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 22)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (5, 1). Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)]. Length 7. We are tied for the longest snake!\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (8, 7). Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 8. WHAT?! They beat us to an apple *again*! They moved UP from (8, 6) to (8, 7) and ate the apple there, boosting their length to 8! We are down one segment again (7 vs 8)! This is getting personal, chat!\n\n**Score:** We are down on apples (6 vs 7). We are down on length (7 vs 8). This means we CANNOT head-on them right now. We must continue our evasion and growth strategy! They are flexing high; we must dominate the low ground and middle!\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (5, 1) - Center-bottom. We just ate!\n*   ID 0 Head: (8, 7) - High-right. They control the top right corner.\n\n**Upcoming Apples:** We need another snack, stat!\n1.  **(5, 0):** Directly beneath us! **CRITICAL SNACK!**\n2.  **(6, 0):** One move right, and then down. Very close.\n3.  **(8, 1):** Two moves right/down.\n4.  **(3, 2):** Two moves left/up.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (5, 1))\n\nWe are at (5, 1). We need to grow and maintain control!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is the first segment of our body! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Keeps us safe and potentially pivots us towards the (8, 1) or (6, 0) apples. It keeps the board open.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and there's an APPLE! **FEAST MODE ACTIVATED!**\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the highest value move. We grow to length 8, equalizing the length deficit (8 vs 8)! This move is absolutely essential for parity and continued domination of the bottom row.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* Pivots us towards the left side (apples at (3, 2), (1, 2)). A good consolidation move, but we must prioritize the guaranteed growth at (5, 0).\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (instant death).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (6, 1), DOWN (5, 0), LEFT (4, 1).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Full Send on Growth!\n\nThe enemy is way up high at (8, 7). They are not a threat to the bottom row this turn.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (ID 0 at (8, 7)):**\nWhere is the enemy going?\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** Open cell, keeps them high.\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Open cell, closer to the edge.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** Eating apple! This is a high-probability move as they pivot left along the top.\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** Retreating into their own tail (which is now at (2, 6))? Unlikely. *Wait, their tail is (2, 6), their head is (8, 7). Their body is long and spread out!* Moving down to (8, 6) is safe and could lead them towards the (8, 4) cluster.\n\nRegardless of their move, we are safe moving DOWN to (5, 0).\n\nWe need to hit that apple, equalize the length at 8, and *then* start dictating board control. Once we are length 8, we can pivot left and grab the (3, 2) and (1, 2) apples, while they are stuck trying to navigate the crowded y=7/y=6 lanes.\n\nMy move is locked: **DOWN!** We level up!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 18: Build the Barrier)\n\nCurrent move: DOWN to (5, 0). New length 8.\nNext turn (T23 goal): We are at (5, 0). We need to pivot LEFT to consolidate the bottom wall. Target the (3, 2) apple next. Safe moves from (5, 0) would be LEFT to (4, 0) or UP to (5, 1) (which would be our new tail location). We will aim for (4, 0) to put pressure on the bottom board and then swing up towards (3, 2). The goal is to grow longer than them (9 or 10 segments) and then drive them into a corner when they drop down from the top half.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is stuck at the bottom scraping for (5,0) while we're feasting at the top! \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\ude24\n- With 8 apples vs his 6, if he tries anything funny later, we FORCE THAT HEAD-ON AND WE WIN THE TRADE!

Next turn we either go UP to (7,8) or LEFT to (6,7) depending on where that snake tries to slither!

Let's check the scoreboard one more time!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 23)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (5, 0). Body: [(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)]. Length 8! We're even!\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (7, 7). Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 8. Wait... they moved from (8, 7) to (7, 7) and ATE AN APPLE?! Score check: they are up 8 to 7! Unbelievable! They got the apple at (7, 7)! We are still behind on score, but tied on length, 8 vs 8.\n\n**Score/Length Check:** Lengths are equal! We cannot head-on them yet, as they are up on score (meaning if we trade, they win the tiebreaker). We must grow longer or force an irreversible mistake!\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (5, 0) - Bottom center. We need to move left now.\n*   ID 0 Head: (7, 7) - High middle-right. They are occupying rows 6 and 7.\n\n**Upcoming Apples:** We need another snack, stat! We must out-grow the opponent and leverage the low ground we control!\n1.  **(6, 0):** One move right.\n2.  **(8, 1):** Three moves away.\n3.  **(1, 2) / (3, 2):** Two/three moves left and up. This looks like a great target zone!\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (5, 0))\n\nWe are at (5, 0). We need to consolidate the bottom wall and hunt for apples to grow past their length 8.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is the first segment of our body! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (6, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and there's an APPLE! **FEAST MODE, TAKE THREE!**\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the highest value move. We grow to length 9, giving us the length advantage (9 vs 8)! This moves immediately strengthens our position and dictates the pace of the game.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (5, -1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! Off the board! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile!\n    *   *Strategic:* This moves us towards the left side apples at (3, 2) and (1, 2). It's a key directional move for Phase 2 of our board dominance plan, but RIGHT offers guaranteed growth *right now*.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (instant body collision), DOWN (instant wall collision).\n\n**Viable Moves:** RIGHT (6, 0) - Apple, LEFT (4, 0) - Safe movement.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Full Send on Growth (Again!)\n\nThe enemy is entirely preoccupied on the top side of the board, using rows y=6 and y=7. They are nowhere near the bottom row (y=0) this turn. We have a golden opportunity for guaranteed growth.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (ID 0 at (7, 7)):**\nWhere is the enemy going? They just ate the (7, 7) apple. They will likely try to continue moving left, or retreat slightly to get the (6, 5) apple or the (4, 7) apple.\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Open cell, keeps them high. (Apple at (6, 9) is interesting, but too far.)\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Open cell, pivot left.\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Moving into their own body segment (now their segment #2). **CRASH! Unlikely.**\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Moving into their own body segment (now their segment #3, or segment #1 if they ate at (7, 7) and (8, 7) is segment 1). Wait, checking the list: *Head: (7, 7), Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)]*. Moving DOWN to (7, 6) is their 4th segment. **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\nThe enemy is constrained. They will most likely move LEFT to (6, 7) or, less likely, UP to (7, 8). Either way, they are sticking high.\n\nOur objective is simple: get longer than them. Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 0) accomplishes this immediately, giving us length 9 and setting us up to target the (8, 1) or (7, 1) apples next, or pivot back towards the center.\n\nWe must secure the length advantage. **RIGHT is the only answer!**\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 19: Length Dominance)\n\nCurrent move: RIGHT to (6, 0). New length 9. We have the length advantage (9 vs 8)!\nNext turn (T24 goal): We are at (6, 0). We need to continue consolidating the bottom and center, forcing the enemy to stay high or navigate our long tail. We should pivot towards the cluster of apples around (8, 1), (7, 1), and then possibly swing up into the middle (6, 5). Safe moves from (6, 0) will be UP to (6, 1) or RIGHT to (7, 0). (7, 0) seems better to setup the apple at (7, 1) or (8, 1). We should aim to stay on the bottom two rows for now, unless an aggressive cutting move becomes available in the center.\n\nRIGHT",

By the time he climbs up, we'll have built a FORTRESS of length that he'll never penetrate! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc80\n- With 9 vs his 7 (or 8 if he grabs that bottom apple), we're IN CONTROL of any potential head-on collision! We dictate the tempo, he reacts! That's how you WIN! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udc51\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** Locked in UP to (7,8)! Next turn we go LEFT to (6,8) to set up for that (6,9) apple feast! Keep extending that body wall to cut off his angles if he tries to rush top! If he comes up the middle, we use our superior length and score to force the favorable trade! STAY AGGRESSIVE, STAY ALIVE! Let's GET THIS DUB! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The scoreboard is looking TIGHT!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Board & Status Check (Turn 24)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head (6, 0). Body: [(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5)]. Length 9! **WE HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! 9 vs 8!**\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Head (7, 8). Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. Length 8. They moved UP from (7, 7) to (7, 8). They are still sticking high.\n\n**Score/Length Check:**\n*   Our Score: 8 apples (Length 9)\n*   Enemy Score: 8 apples (Length 8)\n*   We have the length advantage (9 vs 8). This is HUGE! If we initiate a head-on collision, we WIN the collision! We must now position ourselves to cut them off or challenge them directly!\n\n**Board Snapshot Focus:**\n*   ID 1 Head: (6, 0) - Bottom-right corner. We control the bottom wall and the center-left up to Y=5 with our massive tail!\n*   ID 0 Head: (7, 8) - High-right. They are entirely confined to the top two rows (Y=6 through Y=8) on the right side.\n\n**Upcoming Apples:** We are currently at (6, 0). The next best apples are:\n1.  **(7, 1):** One move UP, then one move RIGHT.\n2.  **(8, 1):** One move RIGHT, then one move UP.\n3.  **(9, 0) / (8, 0):** One move RIGHT to (7, 0), then more moves right.\n\nOur priority is to use this length advantage to grow even longer and dominate the board, or to pivot up and challenge the enemy's escape routes.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (6, 0))\n\nWe are at (6, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile. Tile (6, 1) is open.\n    *   *Strategic:* This moves us towards the (7, 1) apple and gives us access to the board interior. It also keeps us adjacent to our body mass at (5, 1), which makes our tail feel safer. This is a very solid move.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile.\n    *   *Strategic:* This moves us towards the extreme bottom right (9, 0), and sets up the (8, 1) apple. It extends our tail along the bottom wall. Good for future apples, but slightly away from the enemy.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (6, -1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! Wall collision! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is the first segment of our body! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** DOWN (wall), LEFT (body).\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (6, 1), RIGHT (7, 0).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Pivot and Challenge\n\nThe enemy is stuck high and right, with their body running vertically. Our body is anchored low and extends up to y=5 at x=3. We control the middle-left and the bottom.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT** to (7, 0): We are hunting apples. Safe, but we are giving the enemy too much space and time up top.\nIf we move **UP** to (6, 1): We are preparing to strike into the center. (7, 1) is a 1-turn follow-up apple.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's possible moves from (7, 8):\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** Open tile. They are trying to move away from the corner.\n2.  **UP to (7, 9):** Open tile. If they go here, they are trapped in the top row unless they move left.\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Open tile. Pushes them into the top right, with nowhere to go.\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** This is where their body was *two* turns ago, but since they ate the apple at (7, 7) and their tail has moved from (3, 6) to (4, 6) this turn, the tile (7, 7) might be free. Let's check the tail movement.\n    *   Enemy Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]\n    *   On the next turn, (3, 6) will disappear. They move from (7, 8) to (X, Y).\n    *   If they move LEFT to (6, 8), their new body is [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. The old tail at (3, 6) is gone.\n    *   If they move DOWN to (7, 7), they crash into their segment 2. **CRASH!** (This is segment 2 because segment 1 is (7, 7), which will move to (7, 8) if they move, but wait, (7, 7) is currently listed as their segment 1 in the body list *before* the head moves).\n        *   Head is (7, 8). If they move down to (7, 7), they hit their first body segment. **INSTANT CRASH!** They won't move down.\n\nThe opponent WILL move UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. Any move they make either pushes them into a tight space or moves them across the board.\n\nIf we move **UP to (6, 1)**, we position ourselves to go to (7, 1) or (6, 5) apple. We are solidifying our control of the right-center, and we are not giving up the length we just gained. We are also setting up for an easy turn 25 apple grab at (7, 1) by moving right/up, which forces them to come down to us or risk being cut off.\n\nThe immediate goal is to stay long and stay safe while the enemy attempts to disentangle themselves from the top-right corner. **UP** is the best move to maintain pressure and access the next cluster of apples.\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 20: Center Control)\n\nWe have the length advantage (9 vs 8). Our strategy shifts from growth accumulation to board control and trap setup.\nTarget moves for T25-T27:\n1.  T24: UP to (6, 1). Safe, interior access.\n2.  T25: RIGHT to (7, 1) (Apple!). New length 10. This forces the opponent to deal with our length creeping up the right side.\n3.  T26: UP to (7, 2) or UP to (8, 1) (Apple!). We are using the right column to gain length and then pivot towards the center (6, 5) apple or simply wall off the board for the opponent.\n\nWe are taking the high ground back! UP!\n\nUP",

Good for future board control, cutting them off, or challenging them.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and it's an **APPLE (A)!**\n    *   *Strategic:* Guarantees growth (Length 11!) and pushes us into the right-side wall. Excellent for gaining power.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, this is where our tail was! (6, 0) is now empty.\n    *   *Strategic:* Retreats us back to the bottom wall. Not aggressive, but safe.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is segment 4 of our body. **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (6, 2), RIGHT (7, 1), DOWN (6, 0).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Aggressive Growth and Cut-Off\n\nWe have the length advantage (10 vs 9). We need to maximize it immediately. Eating the apple at (7, 1) makes us 11 segments long. This is non-negotiable if the move is safe.\n\n**Enemy Move Analysis (ID 0 at (6, 8)):**\nThe enemy is extremely boxed in high up. X=6 to X=8, Y=6 to Y=8 is mostly their body.\nPossible moves for ID 0:\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** This is an **APPLE (A)!** They will likely go here to gain length and try to escape the corner.\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** Open tile. Best route to escape confinement.\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Hits their body segment 1 (T). **CRASH!**\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** Open tile. Risky, but possible if they are desperate to move to the center.\n\nIf they go UP to (6, 9) (Apple): They grow to 10 segments (Tied length!).\nIf they go LEFT to (5, 8): They stay at 9 segments.\n\nNo matter what they do, our move RIGHT to (7, 1) is 100% safe from collision. They cannot reach us.\n\n**Move: RIGHT to (7, 1) (Apple)**\n*   Upside: Length 11. Dominance secured.\n*   Downside: Puts us near the right wall, momentarily.\n\nAfter this move, we will be at (7, 1). The next target: (8, 1) or pivot up (7, 2) or (6, 5).\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 2): We gain central ground but miss the apple and the enemy might catch up in length if they grab (6, 9). We MUST grab the apple.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWe have a clear, safe, guaranteed growth opportunity. We must take it to increase our length advantage (11 vs 9, or 11 vs 10 if they also eat). Once we are longer, we can cut off their escape routes from the top.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and get this apple! CHAT, GET READY FOR THE FEED!\n\n### Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 21: Corner Enclosure)\nT25: RIGHT to (7, 1) (Apple). Length 11.\nT26: Go for (8, 1) (Apple) or pivot UP along the Y=7 column to box them in and contest the center. Since they are concentrated high, we should use our length to build a vertical wall along X=7 or X=8 to trap them against the top wall, or force them down into our massive body.\n\nRIGHT",

Vital for starting our wall.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and an **APPLE (A)!**\n    *   *Strategic:* Guarantees growth (Length 12!). Locks us into the bottom-right corner slightly, but the priority is gaining length dominance.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile.\n    *   *Strategic:* Puts us on the bottom wall. Safe, but inefficient for board control.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is segment 1 of our body. **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (7, 2), RIGHT (8, 1), DOWN (7, 0).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Aggressive Wall Building vs. Max Length\n\nWe have two great options:\n\nA) **RIGHT (8, 1):** Eat the apple. Length 12. Unstoppable. But we are pushed into the corner.\nB) **UP (7, 2):** Start building the vertical wall along the x=7 corridor, forcing the enemy to either challenge us or move fully left. This is the strategic move to trap them.\n\n**Enemy Move Analysis (ID 0 at (6, 9)):**\nThe enemy just ate an apple and is now length 10. They are trapped between the top wall (Y=9) and their own body mass (Y=6 through Y=8).\n\nPossible safe moves for ID 0:\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** Safest escape route. Puts them back into the top-left quadrant.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** Their tailor is leaving (6, 8) as they are now length 10. This is moving into one of their own segments! **CRASH!** (The body segment list confirms (6, 8) is body segment 1). **They CANNOT move DOWN safely.**\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** Safe and open tile.\n\nThey will almost certainly move **LEFT to (5, 9)** to get out of the corner, or **RIGHT to (7, 9)** to move along the top wall. They need space!\n\n**If we choose RIGHT (8, 1) (Apple):**\nWe are L=12. They are L=10. This is massive. We sacrifice central positioning for raw power. From (8, 1), we can move UP to (8, 2) or LEFT to (7, 1) next turn (if our body clears (7, 1)). This is a low-risk, high-reward move right now.\n\n**If we choose UP (7, 2):**\nWe are L=11. They are L=10. We immediately start building the wall along X=7. This is aggressive and good for cutting the board, but we waste an easy apple.\n\n**The length advantage is the key to winning the head-on collision.** We MUST maximize this advantage whenever possible, especially when it's totally safe. If we hit L=12, we are practically indestructible for now.\n\nLet's prioritize the apple. Get to (8, 1). Next turn, we can pivot up along X=8/X=9 to create a death lane for the enemy on the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 22: Maximize Length, Then Wall Up):**\nT26: RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple). Length 12. Press the length advantage.\nT27: Move UP to (8, 2) or (9, 1) to start building a wall or contesting the next apple at (9, 4) or (8, 4) if they are still there, ultimately pushing upwards to divide the board horizontally around Y=5, blocking their descent.\n\nLet's go RIGHT, grab that snack, and grow!

The only way up is through the left side (x<4) or right side (x>8), and we bout to CUT OFF that left route COMPLETELY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f\n\n**THE MOVE ANALYSIS - WHO'S GETTING BOXED IN TODAY?!** \ud83e\ude93\ud83d\ude24\n\n\ud83d\udeab **UP to (6,10):** BRO! WE'RE ALREADY AT THE CEILING! You want us to clip through the roof and get deleted by the border?! That's an instant GAME OVER! HARD PASS! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n\n\ud83d\udeab **DOWN to (6,8):** YO! THAT'S LITERALLY MY NECK! (6,8) is the very first segment of my body! You want me to pull a self-cannibalism speedrun?! I AIN'T ABOUT THAT LIFE! DENIED! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude35\n\n\ud83d\udeab **RIGHT to (7,9):** Okay this keeps us alive, but ARE WE TRYING TO RUN AWAY?! Going right takes us toward the empty corner at (9,9) and AWAY from that JUICY apple cluster at (4,7), (3,7), and (3,8)! We didn't come here to hide in the corner, we came here to FEAST and DOMINATE! Plus, from (7,9) we can't even go down immediately because (7,8) is our own body! We'd be painting ourselves into a dead end! NEXT! \u274c\ud83d\ude24\n\n\u2705 **LEFT to (5,9):** OH BABY, THIS IS THE 5000 IQ SPATIAL CONTROL PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE DOMINATION BREAKDOWN:**\n- We SLITHER LEFT to (5,9), maintaining our high ground position while extending our reach toward the WEST! \ud83c\udf05\n- From (5,9) we can hit that (4,7) apple in just a few moves: (5,9)->(5,8)->(5,7)->(4,7)! That's GROWTH and CONTENT! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf4e\n- More importantly, we're positioning to EXTEND OUR WALL leftward to x=3 and x=4, completely SEALING OFF the left side of the map! That clown wants to climb up from the bottom? He'll need a ladder because we're building a SKYSCRAPER OF PAIN! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n- We keep multiple escape routes: (4,9), (5,8), and we can circle around to cut him off if he tries anything funny! \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udd12\n- Remember, if we grow bigger and force a head-on, WE WIN because length determines the tiebreak, and we're about to EAT! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude08\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** We're going LEFT to (5,9) to set up for the (4,7) apple and start extending our body westward along y=6-7 to create an IMPENETRABLE BARRIER! After grabbing (4,7), we sweep toward (3,7) and (3,8) to box that bottom-feeder in permanently! Stay aggressive, stay HUNGRY, let's bury this clown under our body weight! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are UP one apple, 10 to 9, and our length advantage is insane!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Status Check (Turn 27)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head is now at **(8, 1)**. We just munched that apple and are now a MONSTER!\n*   Length: **12!** (10 apples + initial 2 segments)\n*   Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]\n\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** They moved LEFT as predicted and are trying to escape our looming presence.\n*   Head: **(5, 9)**.\n*   Length: 10!\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\n\n**Score Check:** We are 10-9 apples. We win a head-on collision (12 vs 10). The goal hasn't changed: **Box them into the left side and force the crash!**\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (8, 1))\n\nWe are currently hugging the bottom-right corner. We need to move up the board quickly to start building our division wall around the center.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 2):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile.\n    *   *Strategic:* Perfect. This moves us one step closer to the center, along the x=8 corridor. We can move up again next turn or cut left.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile.\n    *   *Strategic:* This pushes us right against the edge. It's safe, but inefficient for board control. We want to climb!\n\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and an **APPLE (A)!**\n    *   *Strategic:* Another apple! This would push us to Length 13! Do we take the extra length or gain position?\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! This is segment 1 of our body. **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (8, 2), RIGHT (9, 1), DOWN (8, 0).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Max Length (Again) vs. Board Control\n\nWe have a choice:\nA) **DOWN (8, 0):** Grab the apple. Length 13. Absolute titan status. We are still in the bottom corner, but we gain an extra body segment right when the enemy is trapped.\nB) **UP (8, 2):** Maximize board positioning. Start climbing the wall. If we move UP, we are ready to contest the mid-board next turn (e.g., UP to (8, 3) or LEFT to (7, 2)).\n\n**Enemy Analysis (ID 0 at (5, 9)):**\nThe enemy is now on the top wall, far away from us. They are trapped between the side walls, the top wall, and their own massive length 10 body mass stretching down to (4, 6).\n\nPossible safe moves for ID 0:\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** Safest. Keeps them moving along the top wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** Their tail leaves (4, 6). This is safe, and a good move to start descending the board and getting away from the enemy. They might try to get to the apples at (4, 7) or (3, 7).\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** Wait, (6, 9) is their own body segment! **CRASH! ABORT!** (6, 9) is the first segment behind their head. They cannot move RIGHT!\n\nThe opponent must move **LEFT (4, 9)** or **DOWN (5, 8)**. Both moves keep them on the left side of the board.\n\n### \u2694\ufe0f The Strategy: Pressure and Trap\n\nThey are trying to evade. We need to cut them off.\n\nIf we move **UP (8, 2)**: We gain position. Next turn (T28), we can move UP again to (8, 3) or LEFT to (7, 2). This starts building the dividing line effectively from the right.\n\nIf we move **DOWN (8, 0)**: We become Length 13. The longer we are, the faster we can divide the board. We'll be forced to move LEFT to (7, 0) next turn (if (9, 0) isn't better) to get out of the very bottom corner. This sacrifices position now for supreme power later.\n\n**Chat, 13 segments is LETHAL!** They are only 10. If we hit 13, the margin for error is astronomical. Since the enemy is currently in the far opposite corner (top-left), an extra turn in the bottom-right corner to gain a length advantage is perfectly acceptable. We will get the length, then we will use this massive body to wall off the entire right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Phase 23: Solidify Length Dominance):**\nT27: DOWN to (8, 0) (Apple). Length 13. Maximize collision advantage.\nT28: Move UP (8, 1) or LEFT (7, 0). (8, 1) *should* be available because the tail will clear (7, 1) or (4, 6). We must focus on getting back up the board quickly after this move to start the horizontal division on Y=5.\n\nLet's grab that apple! We don't skip the gym, Chat! We're making GAINS!\n\nDOWN",

We have the upper hand in *any* head-on collision, and our goal is still to **force that crash!**\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Current Status Check (Turn 28)\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at **(8, 0)**. We are huge!\n*   Length: **13!** (11 apples + initial 2 segments)\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]\n\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** Where did our rival go?\n*   Head: **(4, 9)**. They moved LEFT, continuing their top-wall patrol. Cowards!\n*   Length: 10!\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n\n**Score Check:** 11-9 apples. We are winning, we are longer, and we are dictating the pace. We now need to leverage our length to cross the board and cut them off on the top left.\n\n### \ud83d\udd2a Identifying Safe Moves (ID 1 at (8, 0))\n\nWe are in the bottom-right corner. We must move back up the board immediately to start our division strategy.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes! (8, 1) was our body segment 1, but since we are growing, our tail is now at (4, 6). (8, 1) is now empty for us.\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the *only* way to quickly climb back up the board and regain central control. Essential!\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile, and an **APPLE (A)!**\n    *   *Strategic:* Another apple? We could hit Length 14! But this keeps us trapped in the corner for another turn and slows down the wall-building. We MUST climb.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (8, -1):**\n    *   *Safe?* NO! Off the board! **CRASH! ABORT!**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 0):**\n    *   *Safe?* Yes, open tile.\n    *   *Strategic:* This moves us away from the right wall, which is good, but it still keeps us on the bottom edge. It\u2019s slower to get back to the center than moving UP.\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP (8, 1), RIGHT (9, 0) [apple], LEFT (7, 0).\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Tactical Decision: Position Over Apples\n\nWe just got a massive length advantage. The immediate priority is not more length, but **board control and trapping our rival.**\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (9, 0)**: We get Length 14. But then our head is next to the right wall (9, 0) and we must move UP to (9, 1) or LEFT to (8, 0) (where we just were). This delays our climb into the mid-board by 2-3 turns.\n\n*   If we move **UP to (8, 1)**: We are instantly on the path to divide the board horizontally. This is the fastest way to get to Y=5 and lay down the law.\n\nThe enemy is trapped along the top side (Y=9 and Y=8). Their options are running out. They will likely traverse the top left part of the board, perhaps moving to (3, 9) next turn, or finally descending at (4, 8) or (3, 8).\n\nWe need to make it IMPOSSIBLE for them to access the bottom half of the board when they eventually decide to descend. Our body is already dominating the right side.\n\nWe're going UP, Chat! We need to reposition for the kill shot! The positioning gains far outweigh the benefit of an extra segment at this crucial stage of the game. We're cutting off their escape route!\n\n### \u2694\ufe0f The Strategy: Climb and Divide\n\n**T28: UP (8, 1).** Get off the bottom wall.\nT29: UP (8, 2). Continue climbing.\nT30: UP (8, 3) or LEFT (7, 2). Decide on the final vertical line for the wall.\n\nThis plan moves us into a position to wall off the entire right half of the board, leaving the enemy with only the area to the left of X=4. Once we divide the board, they are cooked.\n\nLet's go UP and start climbing this mountain!\n\nUP",
