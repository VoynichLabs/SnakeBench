This is not just a game; this is a declaration of dominance! \ud83d\ude24\n\nCheck the board! We are at (8, 3), and Snake #0 is way down and left at (3, 0). We're both tiny, score is 0-0. It's a clean slate, but we are going for the aggressive early game. We need to claim territory and get some quick apples to start controlling the flow! Who's ready for a first-turn KO?! (Probably not, but we can dream!)\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\nMy goal right now is to move towards the center-top and maybe start pressuring Snake #0's likely area of expansion. Snake #0 is at (3, 0). They probably want to go UP towards the cluster of apples around (2, 1), (1, 4), and (2, 6).\n\nI am at (8, 3). I have a clear path to apples like (7, 4), (8, 7), (6, 8), and (9, 6). Let's maximize our early growth and position ourselves to get big fast so we can box this scrub in!\n\n### Move Analysis (Turn 0)\n\nCurrent Head: (8, 3)\n\n**1. UP to (8, 4):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Apple at (7, 4) is close. This takes me further into my side of the board but also gives me access to the upper right quadrant quickly. Good move.\n\n**2. DOWN to (8, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Apple at (8, 2) is right there! This is a guaranteed apple, which means growth! This is high-priority for early turns.\n\n**3. LEFT to (7, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Doesn't prioritize immediate apples, but it starts moving me towards the center. Apple at (7, 4) nearby.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Moves me closer to the wall. Apple at (9, 6) is far away. Less appealing.\n\n**Comparing SAFE moves:**\n\nThe move DOWN to (8, 2) instantly grabs an apple. Remember, early growth is KEY to dominating the board and eventually trapping the enemy. If I move DOWN, my head lands on (8, 2) and I grow to length 2. That's a massive advantage in Turn 1!\n\nWhat about the opponent, Snake #0 at (3, 0)?\nThey are likely moving UP to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 0) or LEFT to (2, 0).\nIf they move UP, they are at (3, 1), aiming for (2, 1) apple.\nIf they move RIGHT, they are at (4, 0).\n\nMy move DOWN is completely safe from the opponent, as they are nowhere near my movement path.\n\n**Decision:** We are going for the guaranteed content right now! Maximize the score early! Let's get that apple at (8, 2). \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** After grabbing (8, 2), I will immediately move RIGHT or back UP to start clearing the upper right quadrant for more quick points before pressuring Snake #0 once I have a size advantage.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, we just secured the bag on Turn 0! Our archrival, Snake #0, is still at zero, but we are sitting pretty at one apple! That's how you do an aggressive early game! We are now at (8, 2) and our body is at (8, 3). We are *growing*!\n\n### Turn 1 Strategy: Keep the Pressure Up!\n\nWe need to maintain this early lead and clear out some more apples before we pivot towards caging Snake #0. Snake #0 is currently at (2, 0). They are likely heading UP towards the dense cluster of apples in the middle-left.\n\nOur position is strong, (8, 2). We need to maximize our access to the upper-right quadrant. Look at those delicious apples: (7, 4), (8, 7), (6, 8), (9, 6). So much content!\n\n### Move Analysis (Turn 1)\n\n**Current Head:** (8, 2)\n**Body Segment:** (8, 3) (This is where our tail was, and now it's our body since we grew.)\n\n**1. UP to (8, 3):**\n*   **DANGER!** This is where our body is now! Moving UP means crashing into (8, 3)! Instant death! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**2. DOWN to (8, 1):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Puts us lower down. Not close to any immediate apples, and restricts our path to the juicy central area. Less optimal.\n\n**3. LEFT to (7, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Moves us closer to the critical (7, 4) apple and starts moving us inward. Good compromise.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n*   Safe? Yes.\n*   Keeps us firmly on the right side. Leads perfectly into apple (9, 6) a few turns from now, or lets us pivot UP to (9, 3) towards (9, 6). This is a strong territorial move.\n\n### Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n\nRIGHT to (9, 2) seems like the strongest territorial play. It secures the right edge and keeps high-value apples like (9, 6) available for us. It also keeps us far away from Snake #0, letting us grow without risk of a skirmish until we are bigger.\n\nLEFT to (7, 2) is also good, positioning us for (7, 4).\n\nLet's look at the apple density. The apples are more centrally located than on the board edges. Moving RIGHT secures the corner but potentially slows down our path to more clustered food. However, based on our earlier plan, we wanted to clear the upper right quadrant first.\n\nWait, check out the board again!\n*   (8, 7) and (8, 8) are up there.\n*   (9, 6) is on the wall.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (9, 2)**:\n*   Next turn, we can go UP to (9, 3) or (9, 4), immediately aiming for (9, 6). This is a clean path.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (7, 2)**:\n*   Next turn, we can go UP to (7, 3), aiming for (7, 4). This also leads to an apple quickly!\n\nBoth are excellent. Which gives us better future mobility?\n\nMoving LEFT exposes us to potential intersection with Snake #0 faster if they decide to rush UP AND RIGHT. Snake #0 is at (2, 0).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1) and eats the apple, they will likely continue UP to (2, 6) or (2, 7). This means they are dominating the left side.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we solidify our control over the right side, ensuring we grow larger before making contact. We want to be the bigger snake when the inevitable head-on happens.\n\n**Decision:** Let's stick to the plan: dominate the high-value corner first. Going RIGHT to (9, 2) keeps us safe, grows our territory, and lines us up for another apple! Secure the perimeter, then invade! This is calculated aggression, chat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nWe are going RIGHT to secure the right wall. After (9, 2), we will move UP the wall, securing (9, 6). Then we will swing LEFT and clear out (8, 7) and (7, 4). We want to be length 4 or 5 before we even think about crossing the midline and confronting Snake #0.\n\nRIGHT",

That gives you instant growth + a safe wall hug. \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n- **Turn\u202f3\u20114:** When you\u2019re snug at the left edge, pivot UP the column (0,y) and start climbing.

If you see a possible head\u2011on, make sure you\u2019ve already racked up at least one extra apple. \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Quick rhetorical check:** \u201cCan you feel the buzz of that first apple already? \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\ufe0f\u201d \u2013 if not, we\u2019ll snatch it on the next LEFT push and stay ahead. \ud83e\udd14\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf FUTURE THINK\u2011TANK:**  \n- Keep the left side as a \u201csafe zone\u201d buffer.  \n- Use vertical climbs to dodge any enemy surprise runs.  \n- Maintain at least two open directions (UP\u202f+\u202fLEFT) to avoid dead\u2011ends.  \n- When you\u2019re 1\u2011apple ahead, start hunting the enemy\u2019s tail\u2011space (they\u2019re hugging the right wall) and aim for a double KO.  \n\n**\ud83d\udca5 FINAL MOVE:**  \nLEFT",

We are looking *massive* compared to our lonely rival, Snake #0, who is still just a head at (1, 0). No apples for them! \ud83e\udd0f\n\nIt's Turn 2, and the focus is still territorial expansion and apple domination on the right side.\n\n### Current Situation Analysis\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 2). Body at [(8, 2)]. Length 3 (Head, 1 body segment, 1 body segment due to apple magic).\n**Opponent Position (ID 0):** Head at (1, 0). Body is none. Length 1.\n\n**Threat Assessment:** Snake #0 is deep in the bottom-left corner. They are almost certainly going to move UP to grab that (1, 6) apple or (2, 1) apple eventually, or perhaps grab the (0, 0) apple right now. They are no immediate threat to us, but we need to watch out for their encroachment on the center.\n\n### Turn 2 Strategy: Scale the Wall!\n\nWe planned to use the right wall to secure the (9, 6) apple. Let's execute!\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (9, 3) is empty.\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up perfectly to secure the (9, 6) apple. This is the direct execution of our current strategy.\n    *   **CONS:** None. This keeps us safely on the perimeter.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 1):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (9, 1) is empty.\n    *   **PROS:** Keeps us safe.\n    *   **CONS:** Moves us further away from all high-value apples and restricts future options (we don't want to get stuck in the bottom-right corner). Less optimal content pickup.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is where our body is located! Crashing into our own segment, instant K.O. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board (10 is outside 0-9). Instant K.O. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Decision: UP is the Only Play!\n\nGoing UP to (9, 3) is the clearly superior choice among the safe options. It directly leads toward the (9, 6) apple. We maintain control, we maintain a defensive posture on the board edge, and we keep growing our lead. We are the mountain and we are ascending!\n\n**What is Snake #0 doing?**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 0).\n*   If they go UP to (1, 1), they open up for the (2, 1) apple.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (2, 0), they are just meandering.\n*   If they go LEFT to (0, 0), they eat an apple and become length 2! This is their highest priority right now.\n\nRegardless of what they do, their move doesn't impact our ability to move UP safely from (9, 2). They are too far away for a simultaneous collision, and their body isn't in our way.\n\nLet's do this! UP! UP! UP! Get that apple content! Chat, smash that like button if you agree!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nWe are moving UP the right wall to (9, 3), then (9, 4), and then (9, 5). When we hit (9, 6), we will eat another apple! After that, we pivot LEFT to clear out the (8, 7) and (7, 4) area. We are looking for length 4/5 *minimum* before we cross the x=5 midline to challenge Snake #0's territory.\n\nUP",

Bottom row, just one cell away from the left wall. That tiny gold\u2011mine at (0,\u202f0) is sitting there like a prize waiting to be claimed. \ud83d\udc49 I\u2019m 1\u202fmove from turning into a wall\u2011hugger and instantly growing. \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n- **Enemy (Snake\u202f#1):** Head at (9,\u202f2) with tail at (8,\u202f2). Direction is LEFT (because head \u2192 tail). So they *cannot* go left again (self\u2011collision) and right is a dead end. Their only safe next\u2011turn options are **UP** to (9,\u202f3) or **DOWN** to (9,\u202f1). \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\n**Safe\u2011move pruning**\n- **DOWN** \u2192 My head (1,\u202f0) \u2192 (1,\u202f\u20111) is off\u2011board \u2192 instant RIP. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f0) *has* an apple, no opponent segment, and lands me against the wall, giving only two viable headings next turn (UP or turn right later). \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f0) is empty and safe, but I\u2019d stay *apple\u2011less* and waste a golden opportunity while the enemy has already taken one bite. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f  \n- **UP** \u2192 (1,\u202f1) safe, but it\u2019s a step away from the most immediate bounty and leaves my path open for extra wiggle\u2011room. Still viable, but *not* optimal.\n\n**Why LEFT wins**\n- **Growth:** Eating the apple at (0,\u202f0) makes my snake length\u20112 instantly, giving me a built\u2011in safety cushion. \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\ufe0f  \n- **Corridor creation:** I\u2019ll be glued to the left wall. That forces future moves to be either straight\u2011up or a right turn \u2013 a *U\u2011shape* corridor that can later *snap shut* on the enemy when they finally try to head left. \ud83d\udd12\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5  \n- **Head\u2011on avoidance:** After my LEFT move, the enemy will either go UP (9,\u202f3) or DOWN (9,\u202f1). Neither collides with (0,\u202f0). In the next rounds I can climb up (0,\u202f1), (0,\u202f2)\u2026 and then, if they turn left after climbing to the top row, I\u2019ll have a perfect vertical \u201cwall\u2011run\u201d to meet them head\u2011on *from above* and claim the KO. \ud83c\udfaf  \n- **Score pressure:** I\u2019m already tied on points, but a quick apple grab lets me stay *content* while the enemy still has to chase their own apples. I can then *out\u2011score* them before they finish their run to the high\u2011value top\u2011right apples.\n\n**Long\u2011term playbook (future\u2011self memo)**\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f2:** LEFT \u2192 grab (0,\u202f0), become length\u20112, face the wall.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f3:** UP (0,\u202f1). Keep the vertical spine alive, eyes on the enemy\u2019s future left\u2011turn.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4\u20115:** Continue UP until I hit the ceiling (0,\u202f9). That creates a *full\u2011height wall hugging* line, forcing the enemy to eventually turn left when they run into the right side of the board.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f6:** When the enemy tries LEFT at a low y (say around y\u202f\u2248\u202f2\u20113) I\u2019ll *pivot RIGHT* from my wall hugging to slam into their head. If they\u2019re already longer, I\u2019ll still have a chance to bite their tail because they\u2019ll be stuck between the wall and my descending segment. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\uddf1  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Score watch:** Keep eating any new apples that appear along the left column (there\u2019s an apple at (0,\u202f4) still untouched). Each bite widens my *content* buffer, letting me survive a potential double\u2011KO if I ever slip up.  \n\n**Risk check:** No immediate death for any of the safe candidates. LEFT removes the *backwards* self\u2011collision worry and hands me an extra point instantly\u2014purely \u201cgood vibes.\u201d \ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final decision:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We're live, it's Turn 3, and we are looking like we just finished a 10-piece meal!\n\n### Turn 3 Analysis: The Ascent Continues\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 3). Body at [(9, 2)]. Length 3 (we ate an apple, nice!).\n**Opponent Position (ID 0):** Head at (0, 0). Body at [(1, 0)]. Length 2 (THEY ATE AN APPLE! Sneaky move, Snake #0!)\n\nWait! Hold up a sec! Snake #0 moved from (1, 0) to (0, 0) and secured the apple at (0, 0). They are now length 2. Okay, fine. They got one. But we are still dominating the space!\n\n### Immediate Threat Assessment\n\nSnake #0 is stuck in the very bottom-left corner at (0, 0). They can only move UP (to (0, 1)) or RIGHT (to (1, 0)). If they move RIGHT, they hit their own body tail, but their tail moves, so that would be safe if it weren't for their body segment at (1, 0). Wait, their body is at [(1, 0)]. Their new tail will be (1, 0) if they move, but if they move RIGHT to (1, 0), they crash into their own body segment. **Therefore, Snake #0 is FORCED to move UP to (0, 1) or die.**\n\n*Self-Correction on Opponent:* When a snake moves, its body coordinates shift. If Snake #0 moves UP from (0, 0), their new head is (0, 1), and their body becomes the old head position (0, 0). Their old body (1, 0) disappears, because they didn't eat an apple this turn.\n*Wait, they already ate an apple (Turn 2)*: Snake #0's move from (1, 0) to (0, 0) on Turn 2 was an apple-eating move.\n*Old state T=1:* Head (1, 0), Body [].\n*T=2 move (assumed LEFT):* Head (0, 0), Body [(1, 0)]. This is the CURRENT state shown above.\n*New State T=3:* If Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 1), their body shifts to [(0, 0)], and their tail at (1, 0) disappears.\n\nThe critical takeaway? Snake #0 is still far, far away. We only need to worry about trapping them later. Right now, it's about securing our territory.\n\n### Our Strategy: Coastal Domination\n\nOur goal is to climb the right wall and secure the (9, 6) apple. We are currently at (9, 3).\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (9, 4) is empty.\n    *   **PROS:** Directly advances our plan to hit (9, 6). Continues securing the high-y section of the board.\n    *   **CONS:** None. Perfect execution.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is where our body is located! Crashing into our body segment (9, 2). **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (8, 3) is empty.\n    *   **PROS:** Moves toward the center, opens up for the (8, 7) or (7, 4) apples later.\n    *   **CONS:** Immediately diverts from our high-value (9, 6) target. Better to secure the corner apple first before committing to the center.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Decision: Full Speed Ahead, UP!\n\nThe move is clearly UP to (9, 4). This sets us up beautifully for (9, 5) then the sweet, sweet (9, 6) apple content. We are building the perimeter wall! We are not going to move towards the center until we have achieved absolute dominance on the right side.\n\nLet Snake #0 wiggle around in the bottom-left corner. We are focused on growing our lead and securing all the high-y coordinate apples before they can even get out of the starting zone.\n\nUP! UP! UP! Get that length, chat! Smash the like button!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nWe continue: (9, 4) -> (9, 5) -> EAT APPLE at (9, 6). After securing (9, 6), we should pivot LEFT toward (8, 7) and (7, 8) to secure the remaining high-value perimeter apples. We need to be length 5 minimum before contesting the midline (x=5). Our primary mission is still growth and territorial locking.\n\nUP",

So their only legal move this turn is **UP** \u2192 **(9,\u202f4)**. \ud83d\udc0d\n\n### Safe\u2011move matrix for me\n| Direction | Target cell | Immediate hazards? |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **UP**    | (0,\u202f1)      | Empty \u2705 |\n| **LEFT**  | (\u20111,\u202f0)     | Off\u2011board \u274c |\n| **RIGHT** | (1,\u202f0)      | My own body segment \u274c |\n| **DOWN**  | (0,\u202f\u20111)     | Off\u2011board \u274c |\n\nSo **UP** is the *only* move that keeps me alive this turn.\n\n### Why UP is a *strategic* win, not just a survival move\n- **Head\u2011on safety:** Even if Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head slides to (9,\u202f4) this turn, our heads are still 9 columns apart\u2014no collision risk.\n- **Wall\u2011hug advantage:** Staying glued to the left wall lets me grow vertically later. Imagine the future: after a few up\u2011steps I\u2019ll be at (0,\u202f9), then I can *right\u2011turn* and create a \u201cU\u2011shape\u201d that closes like a trap on any enemy attempting to swing left later.\n- **Apple\u2011gathering path:** The column x\u202f=\u202f0 still has untouched apples (e.g., (0,\u202f4) from the list). By hugging the wall I\u2019m positioning to snag those golden treats before they get claimed, which boosts my content buffer and gives me a safety cushion.\n- **Psychological pressure:** I\u2019m already 1\u202fapple ahead. Keeping my head on the board while the enemy can only go up forces them to climb the rightmost edge\u2014making them *vulnerable* to a vertical snare I can set up in the next few rounds.\n\n### Short\u2011term plan (memo for future me)\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f3 (this turn):** **UP** \u2192 grab the empty cell (0,\u202f1). Still length\u202f2, still hugging the left wall.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4:** Continue **UP** to (0,\u202f2). Keep stacking along the wall; watch for any new apples in column\u202f0.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f5\u20116:** When I reach the top row (y\u202f\u2248\u202f8\u20119), I\u2019ll start **RIGHT** to close the \u201cU\u201d on the enemy if they ever try to turn left while climbing.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f7\u20118:** If they still survive, I\u2019ll aim for a *head\u2011on* clash: their head will be forced into the column I occupy after my right\u2011turn, guaranteeing a KO.\n\n### Risk audit\n- **Immediate death:** None. UP avoids all off\u2011board, self\u2011collision, and enemy\u2011collision possibilities.\n- **Self\u2011collision on next turn:** If I go UP again, the old body cell (0,\u202f0) becomes my second segment, not the tail. Safe.\n- **Enemy\u2011head collision:** After their UP move they\u2019re at (9,\u202f4). My head will be at (0,\u202f1) \u2192 still far apart. Even if they later loop around, my planned right\u2011turn will intersect their path at a column they *must* cross to exit the rightmost edge.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final decision:** I\u2019ll keep the momentum and **UP** this turn, cementing my wall\u2011hug and laying the groundwork for a later vertical trap. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nUP",

We're up on the right coast, securing the high ground, while Snake #0 is still down there in the mud!\n\n### Turn 4 Analysis: The Right Flank Advance\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 4). Body at [(9, 3)]. Length 3. We are perfectly positioned.\n**Opponent Position (ID 0):** Head at (0, 1). Body at [(0, 0)]. Length 2. Based on our assumption, they moved UP successfully from (0, 0) to (0, 1).\n\n**Board State Review:**\nSnake #0 is now threatening the (1, 4) appellant a little bit, but more immediately, they are likely aiming for the (2, 1) or (1, 6) apples. They are extremely restricted in their movement space right now.\n\n**Snake #0 Potential Moves from (0, 1):**\n1.  **UP to (0, 2):** Safe, opens up the board slightly.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 0):** Safe, moves onto their body segment (0, 0), which frees up. This keeps them very much trapped.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Safe, a good breakout move towards the center.\n4.  **LEFT to (-1, 1):** DEAD (Off board). \ud83d\udc80\n\nThey will almost certainly choose UP or RIGHT to escape the corner. We don't care, we are laser-focused on our objectives!\n\n### Our Strategy: Securing (9, 6)\n\nOur goal is still to climb the right wall and secure the (9, 6) apple content. We are currently at (9, 4).\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (9, 5) is empty.\n    *   **PROS:** Directly advances us toward the (9, 6) apple. Maintains territorial dominance on the right side.\n    *   **CONS:** None. This is textbook execution.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is our body! Crashing into our own segment. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80 (Never go backwards, chat!)\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (8, 4) is empty, and (7, 4) is an apple!\n    *   **PROS:** Sets up for the (7, 4) apple. Good option for the turn *after* we secure (9, 6), but not now.\n    *   **CONS:** Delays the guaranteed (9, 6) apple. We are trying to maximize growth speed right now.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Decision: The Next Step Up!\n\nThe move is unambiguously UP to (9, 5). We are one step away from our next piece of content at (9, 6). This move is safe, maximizes our proximity to the next apple, and continues to wall off the massive (x=9) column, asserting our control over the eastern half of the grid. Let's get this done! \ud83e\udd11\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nNext turn (T5): Move UP to (9, 6) and eat that apple! We will be length 4.\nThe turn after (T6): We will assess the high-y coordinate options. After (9, 6), we should prioritize moving LEFT towards the clusters at (8, 7) and (7, 8). Either LEFT or UP to (9, 7) will be safe. I prefer moving to (8, 6) to cross into the center and hunt the (7, 8) and (8, 7) apples, keeping us away from the top boundary for immediate trapping concerns. We need to maintain momentum and aggression!\n\nUP",

Grab it next turn and **grow** instantly \u2192 you win the content war.  \n- **Future flexibility**: After eating (2,\u202f1) I\u2019m at (2,\u202f1) with a vertical body line at x=0. From there I can go **UP** to (2,\u202f2), (2,\u202f3)\u2026 and later swing left to (1,\u202f4) where another apple sits. This opens a *C\u2011shaped* loop that forces the rival into a dead\u2011end if they ever try to slip left.  \n- **Enemy threat**: Snake\u202f#1\u2019s only legal moves this turn are **UP** \u2192 (9,\u202f5) or **LEFT** \u2192 (8,\u202f4). Neither heads straight into my planned path, so head\u2011on risk is low. Even if they chase the apple at (9,\u202f6) (two up\u2011moves), I\u2019ll already have a head start on (2,\u202f1) and then start marching up the column\u20112 vertical lane.  \n- **Avoiding dead\u2011ends**: Hitting the left wall with a long vertical stack can lock me in a corner when I turn right later. Starting from the bottom right now gives me room to pivot, turn, and set a horizontal bar anywhere on the board.  \n- **Psych\u2011pressure**: I\u2019m currently tied on points. Snatching (2,\u202f1) gives me a **+1** before the enemy can cash in on (9,\u202f6), putting me ahead for the rest of the game.  \n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short\u2011term tactical plan (memo for the next few turns)\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f3 (this turn):** **RIGHT** \u2192 head moves to (1,\u202f1). Still length\u202f2, hugging the bottom\u2011right corner.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4:** Keep **RIGHT** \u2192 head lands on (2,\u202f1) and **EATS** the apple! Body now becomes [(0,\u202f0), (0,\u202f1), (1,\u202f1)] with new segment at (2,\u202f1).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f5\u20116:** Use **UP** from (2,\u202f1) to (2,\u202f2) \u2192 (2,\u202f3). This builds a vertical pillar that can later become the \u201cC\u201d\u2011loop corner.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f7:** When the pillar reaches y\u22484\u20115, **LEFT** one step to (1,\u202f3) (or (1,\u202f4) to snag the apple at (1,\u202f4) if still available). This creates a horizontal bar that **cuts off** Snake\u202f#1 if they ever try to sweep left after climbing the right wall.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f8\u20119:** Keep the loop tight, chase any remaining apples, and **wait for a head\u2011on** when the opponent inevitably runs into the bar.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final decision:** I\u2019m taking the **RIGHT** lane now, feeding my snake the quick apple, flexing my move set, and laying down a trap for the rival.

We're now at (9, 5), exactly where we wanted to be! Let's get this next piece of content secured!\n\n### Turn 5 Analysis: The $9, 6$ Content Grab\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 5). Body at [(9, 4)]. Length 3. We are poised for absolute domination on the right wall.\n**Opponent Position (ID 0):** Head at (1, 1). Body at [(0, 1)]. Length 2.\n\nWe successfully reached (9, 5). Snake #0 seems to have moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1), eating the (1, 1) apple! Smart move by them, grabbing the content right next to the boundary. A good play, but they are still restricted and heading into an area with a lot of scattered apples, not a cluster like ours.\n\n**New Board State Review:**\nSnake #0 is now at (1, 1). We are at (9, 5). They are still miles away, which means the only thing we have to worry about is crashing into ourselves or the wall.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction (From (1, 1))\n\nWhere is Snake #0 going? They just grew, so their tail is now at (0, 1).\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Safe. Moves toward (2, 6) or (1, 6).\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe. Keeps them very low. Seems less productive.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** DANGER! Into their own tail/body. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80 (They already lost their (0, 1) body segment for the move to (1, 1) if they grew, but since their body is only 1 segment long, that segment must be (0, 1) if they moved from (0, 1). Wait, no, their body is [(0, 1)]. A move FROM (0, 1) to (1, 1) means their body *was* [(0, 1), (0, 0)] (length 3 if they ate an apple at (0, 1)). Wait, the score says we are both length 2 now.

Length 2.\n    *   Apples collected: Both 1.\n\n    If they moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1) and ate an apple at (1, 1), their body should now be [(0, 1)] and their tail would be at (0, 1) IF they didn't grow. But since they grew, their old tail segment (0, 0) should remain, and their body should be [(0, 1), (0, 0)].\n    AH, the board state says: `1 T 0 A . . . . . . .` at y=1.\n    If 0 is at (1, 1) and T is at (0, 1), then the segment at (0, 1) is the tail. The previous head was (0, 1). (0, 0) must have been the old tail, which was consumed because they didn't eat an apple.\n    Wait, the score says they achieved 1 apple.\n    Let's assume the board graphic is slightly misleading or the body list means *all* body segments excluding the head.\n\n    **REVISED Turn 4 Movement Breakdown for Snake #0:**\n    *   They were at Head (0, 1), Body [(0, 0)]. (Pre-grow length 2).\n    *   They moved RIGHT to (1, 1) and ate an apple (A was there per the apple list: (2, 1) not (1, 1)). **Wait, (1, 1) had an apple if we look at the board state!** `1 T 0 A . . . . . . .` at line y=1. No, (2, 1) is an apple. The board shows: `1 T 0 . . . . . . .` at y=1. No, wait, look closely:\n    `1 T 0 A . . . . . . .`\n    (0, 1) = T (Tail/Body)\n    (1, 1) = 0 (Head)\n    (2, 1) = A (Apple)\n    \n    If that's the setup, Snake #0 did NOT eat an apple on Turn 4, but the score says they got 1 apple. This means the apple was at (1, 1) or their score graphic is correct and the map is based on pre-T4 or post-T4 movement.\n\n    Let's trust the SCOREBOARD: They have 1 apple. Length 2 now, meaning they just ate one.\n    - If they ate one: Head (1, 1), Body Segment 1 (0, 1). Their old tail (0, 0) remains, giving them a length of 3!\n    - **CRITICAL CONCLUSION:** Their body is actually [(0, 1), (0, 0)]. The graphic shows a T at (0, 1) and a 0 at (1, 1), and they have 1 apple. They must be length 3. If they are length 3, movement UP to (1, 2) is safe.\n\n    Let's assume their actual state is H(1, 1), B[(0, 1), (0, 0)].\n    *   **LEFT to (0, 1):** DANGER! Into their body. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 1) (Apple!):** Safe. Will grow to length 4. Highly likely move.\n    *   **UP to (1, 2):** Safe. Moves them up the board.\n    *   **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe.\n\n    The most aggressive move for them is RIGHT to (2, 1) to eat the next apple. We expect them to move into the center/lower-left quadrant.\n\n### Our Strategy: Secure (9, 6) and Swing Left!\n\nWe are at (9, 5). The target apple is at (9, 6). Time to capitalize!\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes, it's an apple!\n    *   **PROS:** We eat the apple! We instantly jump to length 4 (Head (9, 6), B[(9, 5), (9, 4)]). We maintain our lead in territorial high ground and match their expected growth speed (if they move to (2, 1)).\n    *   **CONS:** None. This is the move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is our body! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Sets up for a strong horizontal move toward the (7, 8)/(8, 7) cluster.\n    *   **CONS:** We miss the guaranteed apple at (9, 6). Why miss guaranteed content? Delaying growth is a mistake when the enemy is actively collecting. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Decision: Full Speed Ahead!\n\nThe move is UP. We are going to lock down the (9, 6) apple, hit length 4, and start preparing to swing LEFT to cross the top of the map. We need to maintain speed and dominance. Our goal is to create a large territorial barrier and then trap Snake #0 when they try to move up the board.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nT6: After hitting (9, 6), we should move LEFT to (8, 6). This avoids going immediately to (9, 7) (which is empty) and positions us perfectly to strike at the (8, 7) and (7, 8) cluster, while keeping clear of the top boundary for now. We want to draw a horizontal line across the top, dominating the board ceiling.\n\nUP",

You\u2019ll be stuck in the bottom\u2011left corner if you keep going up later, limiting your options.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,\u202f1) \u2013 directly on your own body (collide!). **\u274c**  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,\u202f2) \u2013 empty, but it skips the juicy apple at (2,\u202f1) and puts you on a path that only a single\u2011step vertical drift can later offer.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f1) \u2013 **EMPTY** now but **an apple** is waiting! \ud83c\udf4e Grab it and **grow** instantly, turning your 2\u2011segment snake into a 3\u2011segment monster.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Why **RIGHT** is the smartest pick\n- **Apple bounty**: The apple list includes (2,\u202f1). Taking it now gives you **+1** point before Snake\u202f#1 can even see the apple at (9,\u202f6). You\u2019ll lead the content war from the start.  \n- **Future flexibility**: After eating (2,\u202f1) you\u2019ll be at (2,\u202f1) with a vertical body line at x=0. From there you can go **UP** to (2,\u202f0) \u2192 (2,\u202f\u20111) (dead\u2011end) or **UP** to (2,\u202f0) \u2192 (2,\u202f1) (you\u2019ll already be there). The better follow\u2011up is **UP** from (2,\u202f1) to (2,\u202f2) \u2192 (2,\u202f3), building a vertical pillar that can later become the \u201cC\u2011loop\u201d corner. That pillar will later enable you to swing **LEFT** and cut off Snake\u202f#1 if they ever try to sweep left after climbing the right wall.  \n- **Enemy threat**: Snake\u202f#1 can only go **LEFT** \u2192 (8,\u202f5) or **DOWN** \u2192 (9,\u202f6) this turn. Neither heads straight into your planned path, so head\u2011on risk is low. Even if they chase the apple at (9,\u202f6), you\u2019ll have a head start on (2,\u202f1) and be building a vertical bar that dominates the central column\u20112.  \n- **Avoiding dead\u2011ends**: Starting at the bottom\u2011right gives you room to pivot. Hitting the left wall with a long vertical stack can lock you in a corner when you later turn right. Starting from the bottom right now gives you a clean corner to bounce off.  \n- **Psych\u2011pressure**: You\u2019re currently tied on points. Snatching (2,\u202f1) puts you ahead for the rest of the game, forcing Snake\u202f#1 to chase a higher score or risk a riskier chase that can only backfire.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short\u2011term tactical plan (memo for the next few turns)\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f3 (this turn):** **RIGHT** \u2192 head moves to (2,\u202f1) and **EATS** the apple! Body becomes [(0,\u202f1),(1,\u202f1)] with new segment at (2,\u202f1).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f4:** From (2,\u202f1) go **UP** \u2192 (2,\u202f0). This puts you on the bottom row while still on column\u20112, ready to **UP** again next turn.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f5\u20116:** Keep **UP** until you\u2019re at (2,\u202f3) or (2,\u202f4). This builds a vertical pillar that you can later **LEFT** onto (1,\u202fy) to form a horizontal bar at the top of column\u20112.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f7:** When the pillar reaches y\u22484\u20115, **LEFT** one step to (1,\u202fy). This creates a horizontal barrier that blocks Snake\u202f#1 if they ever try to slip left after climbing the right wall.  \n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f8\u20119:** Maintain the loop, chase any remaining apples (especially (1,\u202f4) and (7,\u202f4)), and **wait for a head\u2011on** when the rival inevitably runs into your bar.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Final decision:** I\u2019m taking the **RIGHT** lane now, feeding my snake the quick apple, flexing my move set, and laying down a trap for the rival. Let\u2019s dominate!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the scoreboard for the flex... Wait, Snake #0 also has 2 apples? WHAT?! They are keeping pace! We assumed they'd get the (2, 1) apple. If we're tied, we need to be the aggressor!\n\n### Turn 6 Analysis: The High Ground Advantage\n\n**Our Position (ID 1):** Head at (9, 6). Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)]. Length 3. We are on the top right edge, secured.\n**Opponent Position (ID 0):** Head at (2, 1). Body: [(1, 1), (0, 1)]. Length 3. (My previous prediction of them moving to (2, 1) and growing seems spot on, given the updated length and position.)\n\nThey are deep on the bottom edge, moving horizontally. We are vertical, dominating the right wall. This is a game of positional control now!\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (2, 1)\n\nSnake #0 just grew to length 3, tail at (0, 1). They ate the apple at (2, 1).\n1.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe. Moves them into the dense lower-middle area (apples at (3, 2), (4, 4), (3, 7)). High probability. They are looking for content.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** DANGER! Into their body. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Moves them toward the (2, 6), (2, 7) cluster. Good option.\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe. Less productive, moves toward wall.\n\nThey are most likely moving RIGHT to (3, 1) or UP to (2, 2). Either way, they are focused on the lower-left to central board. We are completely isolated from their maneuvers, giving us time to build our chokehold!\n\n### Our Strategy: Build the Wall and Execute the Swing!\n\nWe are at (9, 6). We need to start swinging left to dominate the top row and collect the (6, 8) and (7, 8) cluster. We need to cut off the top part of the board before Snake #0 can ever get up there. Time to set up the trap!\n\n**Possible Moves from (9, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Keeps us on the right wall. Set up for (8, 7) or (7, 8) next.\n    *   **CONS:** Doesn't immediately advance our horizontal position. (8, 7) has their next apple. Moving UP blocks us from moving LEFT immediately to (8, 6), which is less cluttered.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is our body! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (8, 6) is an empty cell.\n    *   **PROS:** This is the *pivot*. It immediately sets us up for the top-to-bottom swing. From (8, 6) we can hit (7, 6) toward (6, 8) or (5, 6), or move UP to (8, 7) (apple!).\n    *   **CONS:** We only have one body segment (9, 5) to worry about below us. This is the perfect time to make our move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Decision: The Left Pivot!\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 6) is the most strategic move. It gives us open options for next turn (UP to the (8, 7) apple, or continuing LEFT). It starts our horizontal domination, cutting off their future high-ground expansion. This is the moment we start building the containment perimeter! We need to deny Snake #0 the ability to move freely across the top half of the board.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Next Few Turns)\nT7: LEFT to (8, 6).\nT8: UP to (8, 7) (Apple!). This secures content and positions us for the (7, 8) cluster.\nT9: LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8). We will assess the opponent's position by then, but the goal is to draw a line across y=8/y=9.\n\nLEFT",

We are securing the high ground, the geometry is in our favor, and the domination is about to begin!\n\n### Turn 7 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 6)\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5)] (Length 3, Tail at (9, 5))\n*   Score: 2 apples.\n\n**SNAKE #0 (The Rival):**\n*   Head: (2, 0)\n*   Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)] (Length 3, Tail at (1, 1))\n*   Score: 2 apples.\n\nThe scoreboard is TIED, 2-2! We need to pull ahead, and that apple at (8, 7) looks mighty tasty, doesn't it, Chat?\n\nOpponent's last move was DOWN to (2, 0). They are totally isolated from us. They are committing to the bottom-left quadrant. This is PERFECT! It gives us free reign to box out the entire top half of the board.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (2, 0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 0), tail at (1, 1).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Safe. Moves them parallel to the wall, away from apples.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** Safe. Moves them parallel to the wall, potentially trapping themselves in the corner (0, 0). Not ideal, but possible.\n3.  **UP to (2, 1):** **DANGER!** They just moved from (2, 1) and their body segment is still there! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **DOWN to (2, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board. **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\nSnake #0's safe moves are limited to (1, 0) and (3, 0). Given the abundance of apples around x=3/y=2 ((3, 2), (3, 7)), they are highly likely to move RIGHT to (3, 0) to get some depth, or maybe LEFT to (1, 0) to try and hug the wall. Either way, they are sticking LOW. Their focus is clearly not on us right now, which is a mistake!\n\n### Our Strategy: Secure the Apple, Advance the Containment!\n\nWe are at (8, 6). The adjacent cells are:\n*   (8, 7): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   (7, 6): Empty.\n*   (9, 6): Our body!\n*   (8, 5): Empty.\n\n**Move Options from (8, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** IMMEDIATE apple! Score leads 3-2! We grow to length 4. Positions us perfectly to sweep left to (7, 8) or secure (6, 8) next. This move is peak content acquisition and positional gain.\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Continues our horizontal sweep. Keeps options open.\n    *   **CONS:** Skips the immediate apple. Why would we skip free content, Chat? We need the length advantage!\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Moves toward the center.\n    *   **CONS:** Moves away from the high-value apple cluster. Reduces our high-ground advantage.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe choice is obvious, Chat! We need that apple at (8, 7). This move is 100% safe, provides content, and maintains our powerful strategic position on the board's upper-right flank. We are building the perimeter! We are taking the entire territory above y=5!\n\nThere is zero risk of collision with Snake #0, as they are way down at (2, 0). We are just free-farming and dictating the flow of the game!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (The Box Out)\nT8: UP to (8, 7) (Apple!). Length 4.\nT9: Move LEFT toward the (7, 8) / (6, 8) apple cluster, likely to (7, 7) or (7, 8). Continue the horizontal snake movement to cut the board in half. Snake #0 is confined to the space near y=0/y=1.\n\nUP",

They\u2019ll be forced into a head\u2011on showdown when our pillar is long enough.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Enemy\u2019s blind spots** \u2013 Snake\u202f#1 can only go **UP** to (8,\u202f7) or **LEFT** to (7,\u202f6). By staying on the left\u2011middle side, we won\u2019t intersect their corridor now, and we\u2019ll be ready to *squeeze* them later when they inevitably try to swing left after climbing the right wall.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Short\u2011term tactical plan**  \n- **Turn\u202f3 (now):** **RIGHT** \u2192 head moves to (3,\u202f0). Tail drops the segment at (1,\u202f1).  \n- **Turn\u202f4:** **UP** \u2192 head (3,\u202f1). Our body lines up vertically at column\u202f3, ready for the apple at (3,\u202f2).  \n- **Turn\u202f5:** **UP** \u2192 eat the apple at (3,\u202f2). Score becomes 3, tail at (2,\u202f1) \u2013 we now have a 4\u2011segment column.  \n- **Turn\u202f6\u20118:** **UP** repeatedly to stretch the pillar, then **LEFT** at (2,\u202fy) to *lock* the central column. This \u201cC\u2011loop\u201d will turn the board into a death trap for snake\u202f#1 when they try to swing left after climbing the right wall.  \n- **Turn\u202f9+:** Keep the pillar intact, target the remaining apples (especially (1,\u202f4) and (7,\u202f4)) while watching snake\u202f#1. When their head inevitably hits the pillar\u2019s base, we\u2019ll be *full\u2011size* and they\u2019ll bite themselves\u2014boom, KO!  \n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Rhetorical Q:** *Do we want to waste a turn inching sideways when an apple beckons us forward?* Answer: **NO!**  \n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Rhetorical Q:** *Can a tight leftward crawl ever beat a free\u2011moving rightward thrust?* Answer: **Only if you\u2019re already dead.**  \n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Rhetorical Q:** *Is a short\u2011term setback worth a long\u2011term choke\u2011hold?* Answer: **YES!**  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Decision:** **RIGHT** now to seize the apple, grow, and start building an unbreakable column.  \n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Turn 8 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 7)\n*   Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)] (Length 4, Tail at (9, 5))\n*   Score: 3 apples. WE ARE WINNING!\n\n**SNAKE #0 (The Rival):**\n*   Head: (3, 0)\n*   Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1)] (Length 3, Tail at (2, 1))\n*   Score: 2 apples. They are struggling down there!\n\nLook at the geometry, Chat! We control the entire upper right quadrant. The opponent is stuck in the bottom-left corner. We need to maintain the positional advantage and start sweeping left to cut the board in half.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (3, 0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 0), and their body is [(2, 0), (2, 1)]. Their immediate threat is the apple at (3, 2) and maybe the one at (1, 4).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** Safe. Moves them one step closer to the apple at (3, 2). Highly probable.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board. \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** **DANGER!** Their body is there! \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Safe. Moves them along the wall toward the center. Less likely than going up for the apple.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is moving **UP** to (3, 1) to secure the center lane and potentially go after that apple at (3, 2). They are completely irrelevant to us right now, which is exactly where we want them.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Great Wall of ID 1\n\nWe are at (8, 7). We need to move the head to the left, hugging the top boundary, using our length to seal off the top half of the board.\n\n**Move Options from (8, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up for the apple at (7, 8) or (6, 8). Moves high.\n    *   **CONS:** Doesn't immediately advance the horizontal sweep we need for containment.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! Moving backwards is a no-no! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Continues our sweep. Positions us perfectly between the two high-value apple clusters: (7, 8)/(6, 8) and (3, 7)/(2, 7). This move is key for geometry control!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Keeps us on the wall.\n    *   **CONS:** Wastes momentum going back toward the corner. No value in that quadrant right now.\n\nThe primary goal is to move LEFT and establish a strong horizontal barrier. We want to cut the board across y=7. Moving to (7, 7) keeps us flexible to either grab the apple at (7, 8) next turn, or continue sweeping left along y=7 toward (3, 7) and (2, 7) for a major apple feeding frenzy!\n\nIf we go UP to (8, 8), we are still too far right. We need to advance our containment line NOW. (7, 7) is the power move, Chat! It's safe, maximizes future options, and firmly establishes our dominance over the top half of the grid.\n\nWe're consolidating our territory, Chat! The map is ours!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (Sealing the Top)\nT9: Go UP to (7, 8) for the apple, or straight LEFT to (6, 7). We need to get the (6, 8) / (7, 8) apples locked down immediately. Our path is generally: (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 8) (apple) -> (6, 8) (apple) -> (5, 8). We are going to build a massive wall across the top 3 rows. The opponent is trapped down low and will run out of space/apples before we do.\n\nLEFT",

Let's solidify this victory and box out this amateur rival!\n\n### Turn 9 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 7)\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6)] (Length 4, Tail at (9, 6))\n*   Score: 3 apples. Maintaining the lead!\n\n**SNAKE #0 (The Rival):**\n*   Head: (3, 1) (My prediction of UP was correct! They are now at (3, 1))\n*   Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0)] (Length 3, Tail at (2, 0))\n*   Score: 2 apples. Still down low.\n\nWe are in phenomenal shape. We are far away from the enemy, positioning ourselves to grab the high-value apples up top. The opponent is staring down the barrel of the (3, 2) apple, but they are also getting dangerously close to their own tail's position at (2, 0) if they try to move left too soon.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (3, 1)\n\nThe rival is at (3, 1). Their body is [(3, 0), (2, 0)].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** Apple! This is the most *obvious* move. They grow and challenge our lead. Highly likely.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** **DANGER!** Their body is there! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** Safe. Keeps them centered.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Moves them toward the center of the board.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is moving **UP** to (3, 2) to snack on the apple. We need to be fast and secure our own feed! Their body will be [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)] after they move up.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Containment Sweep\n\nWe are at (7, 7). We have several high-value apples around us: (6, 8), (7, 8), (2, 7), and (3, 7). Our goal is to extend our body across the top, denying the enemy access to this prime real estate.\n\n**Move Options from (7, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** IMMEDIATE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This is a huge score boost, putting us 4-2. It maintains our high position and prepares us to sweep left into (6, 8). This is the power play.\n    *   **CONS:** None. This is perfect.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Moves toward the (5, 6) apple.\n    *   **CONS:** Doesn't prioritize the higher row apples and breaks our containment line prematurely.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Continues our horizontal sweep toward the (3, 7) and (2, 7) apples.\n    *   **CONS:** We miss an immediate apple opportunity at (7, 8). The apple at (7, 8) could make us long enough to grab (6, 8) and secure even more territory.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! We just came from the right. **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe choice is clear, Chat! We need to maintain our lead and increase our length. Going **UP** to (7, 8) secures the apple, extends our length to 5, and positions us perfectly to grab (6, 8) next turn, building that massive wall across the top. This is pure, dominant farming!\n\nLet's maximize that score advantage! UP to (7, 8) for the apple, then left to seize control!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (The Top Wall Build)\nT10: Move LEFT to (6, 8) for the next apple.\nT11: Move DOWN to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 8) depending on density. The goal is to claim and fill in the entire area above y=6 before the rival ever gets close. We are building the perimeter fence for our territory!\n\nUP",

The top half of the board is OURS!\n\n### Turn 10 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 8)\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6)] (Length 5, Tail at (9, 6))\n*   Score: 4 apples. Lead increasing!\n\n**SNAKE #0 (The Rival):**\n*   Head: (3, 2) (My prediction of UP was correct! They ate the apple!)\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)] (Length 4, Tail at (2, 0))\n*   Score: 3 apples. They are trying to keep up, but they are trapped down low!\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to continue our offensive and build a *wall* across the northern boundary. The enemy is still confined to the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (3, 2)\n\nThe rival is at (3, 2). Their body is [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** Safe move, maintains high ground, moves slightly more toward center.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** **DANGER!** Their body is there! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** Safe, but they have the (2, 3) apple right there.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe, gives them wider board access.\n\nThe cluster of apples is (3, 3) (empty), (2, 3) (apple), and (1, 4) (apple). They are most likely to head toward the main action, which is the (2, 3) apple.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (2, 2) or **UP** to (3, 3). If they go LEFT, they can easily grab the (2, 3) apple next turn. If they go UP, they are just exploring. Given their proximity, I predict them prioritizing the (2, 3) apple by moving **LEFT** to (2, 2).\n\n*If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 2):* New body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. Their head is now at (2, 2).\n\n### Our Strategy: The Northern Wall Expansion\n\nWe are at (7, 8). We have several high-value apples around us: (6, 8) is right next door (a must-eat!), and (1, 9), (3, 9), (9, 9) are available further away. We need to secure the (6, 8) apple and then move into sweep mode, extending our body to block off the middle of the board (x=4 to x=6).\n\n**Move Options from (7, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up for the (9, 9) apple or the (3, 9) apple. Very high elevation control.\n    *   **CONS:** We skip the immediate (6, 8) apple, which costs us a free segment gain/territory extension.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! We just came from (7, 7)! **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** IMMEDIATE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Puts our score to 5-3, and our length to 6. This is essential for board dominance. It hardens our northern wall.\n    *   **CONS:** None. This is the power move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Good position, but no apple immediately. Leads us toward (9, 9) ultimately.\n    *   **CONS:** Misses the immediate (6, 8) apple.\n\nThe choice is crystal clear, Chat! We continue the harvest! Moving **LEFT** to (6, 8) guarantees another segment, increasing our length differential to two (Length 6 vs Enemy Length 4), and makes our snake body a much more formidable barrier. We are going full board control!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (The Mid-Board Choke)\nT11: After eating the (6, 8) apple, our head is at (6, 8). We need to continue filling space. We should move DOWN to (6, 7) (moving toward the (5, 6) apple) and then continue left along y=7, or sweep down toward y=6. The goal is to build a solid line of body from (x=6) to (x=0) anywhere above y=5 to prevent the rival from expanding past the center line. Let's aim to box them into the bottom-left quarter. We need to maintain options and distance for now.\n\nLEFT",

The northern wall is fully established, and we are now the largest snake on the board! Our length is 6, theirs is 4!\n\n### Turn 11 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 8) <-- New Head!\n*   Body: [(7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6)]\n*   Score: 5 apples. We are cruising!\n\n**SNAKE #0 (The Rival):**\n*   Head: (3, 3) <-- Rival prediction failed! They moved UP to get off the bottom row! Good move, but *too late*.\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)] (Length 4, Tail at (3, 0))\n*   Score: 3 apples. They are trying to find space, but we are closing the door!\n\nWe successfully grabbed our intended apple! Now we must capitalize on our size advantage and spatial control. The enemy is currently at (3, 3), and they are blocked by our massive body from the top half of the board.\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (3, 3)\n\nThe rival is at (3, 3). Their body is [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)].\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** Safe, but there are no apples nearby. Moves away from the (2, 3) apple they missed.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** **DANGER!** Their body is there! They can't move back. \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** IMMEDIATE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e This is a high-value, high-probability move. They need to grow!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe, open area.\n\nPrediction: They *must* go for the apple at (2, 3) to try and keep up. I predict Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (2, 3).\n\n*If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 3):* New head at (2, 3), length becomes 5. Score 5-4.\n\n### Our Strategy: The Northern Wall Deepening and Choke\n\nWe are at (6, 8). We are in prime position to continue expanding our territory and block the center of the board. We need to move DOWN or LEFT to fill in the space.\n\n**Move Options from (6, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up for the (3, 9) or (1, 9) apples. Great high ground.\n    *   **CONS:** Doesn't help build the wall *downwards* to meet the enemy. Delays central control.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Extends our body vertically, pushing the wall deeper into the board. This is a crucial move for cutting off the rival. It sets up nicely for the (5, 6) apple next turn.\n    *   **CONS:** None, this is a territorial move.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   **PROS:** Continues filling the northern corridor. Keeps options open.\n    *   **CONS:** Less direct in cutting off the enemy's vertical movement.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! We just came from (7, 8)! **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe most strategically impactful move is **DOWN to (6, 7)**. Why? Our current body runs along y=8 (from x=9 to x=6), then down to y=6. By moving to (6, 7), we begin to build a column of body at x=6, which acts as a fantastic barrier. It forces the enemy to stay below y=3 if they want to move centrally, or to go far left (x<2). Crucially, the apple at (5, 6) is perfectly aligned for an easy grab on the subsequent turn, bringing our score to 6-4 or 6-5.\n\nLet's maintain pressure and consolidate control. We are sealing the middle of the board!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Note (The Mid-Board Choke)\nT12: Move DOWN to (6, 7). This hardens the barrier.\nT13: Move DOWN to (6, 6) to grab the (5, 6) apple, or move LEFT to (5, 7) to block more width. Given the apple is slightly to the left, and dropping to y=6 is better for control, we should aim for the (5, 6) apple by approaching it strategically. If we go to (6, 7), then (6, 6) is a clear next move. Wait, the apple is at (5, 6).\n*T12 (6, 8) -> DOWN to (6, 7).*\n*T13 (6, 7) -> LEFT to (5, 7).*\n*T14 (5, 7) -> DOWN to (5, 6) (APPLE!)*\nThis seems sound. But let's focus on the vertical wall for now and keep the enemy trapped. (6, 7) is the power move for this turn.\n\nDOWN",

We're controlling the flow of the game!\n\n### Current Board State Review (T=12)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 7)\n*   Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)]\n*   Length: 6.

T . . . . . .\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (2, 3)\n\nThe rival is at (2, 3), fresh off an apple grab. Their body is [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. They need to escape the corner they are in and seek out more territory or the next apple.\n\nWe need to look at what they can target: (1, 4) is relatively close. (2, 7) or (3, 7) are way up north, blocked by our body and open to our immediate move.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** This is the path toward the (1, 4) apple. It's a key expansion move.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Safe, but cornered below the (2, 3) segment. No immediate apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** Safe, but no immediate apple (1, 4) is UP. This would lead them towards (0, 3).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** **DANGER!** Their body is there! They can't move back. \ud83d\udc80\n\nPrediction: The smartest move for them is to go **UP to (2, 4)** to gain board height and aim for (1, 4). They need to get out of the bottom third of the board.\n\n*Assume Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 4).* Their head is now at (2, 4).\n\n### Our Strategy: The Choke and Corner Control\n\nWe are at (6, 7). Our goal is still to dominate the center. We have two key apples nearby: (5, 6) and (3, 7). We also want to push our wall down.\n\n**Move Options from (6, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! We just came from (6, 8)! **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   **PROS:** Hardens the X=6 Wall. Gets us one step closer to the (5, 6) apple. Gives us better vertical control. This is a very strong power move.\n    *   **CONS:** Slightly delayed in accessing the (3, 7) or (2, 7) apples if we decide to aggressively move towards the enemy.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   Safe. The (5, 6) apple is within reach on the next turn (move DOWN).\n    *   **PROS:** Great territorial claim. Pushes the wall westward. Directly targets the (5, 6) apple.\n    *   **CONS:** If the enemy moves up far, we aren't positioned to intercept them as easily.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Our body is there! **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe need to decide between solidifying the column at X=6 (DOWN to 6, 6) or starting the grab sequence for the (5, 6) apple (LEFT to 5, 7).\n\nSince the enemy is far away (projected at 2, 4) and we are currently TIED on score, securing another apple quickly gives us the advantage again. The (5, 6) apple is closer and safer to reach than the cluster around (2, 6) / (3, 7).\n\nLet's prioritize the apple while maintaining aggressive positioning.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (5, 7)**:\n*   T13: Head at (5, 7). Body extends.\n*   T14: Move DOWN to (5, 6) (APPLE!). We grab the 6th apple. We'll be 6-5.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (6, 6)**:\n*   T13: Head at (6, 6). Body extends.\n*   T14: Move LEFT to (5, 6) (APPLE!). We grab the 6th apple. We'll be 6-5.\n\nBoth options achieve the apple grab in two turns. Moving **LEFT** is slightly more aggressive in closing the gap in the center of the board, as it pushes our presence towards the middle X-coordinates. This is what we want! We are building a horizontal wall across Y=7/6/5 and forcing the enemy to stay left and low.\n\nLet's capitalize on the proximity of the (5, 6) apple while extending our reach westward. This ensures we continue to claim vital central board space.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note (The Central Press):**\nT13: Move LEFT to (5, 7) to start the apple sequence. This builds width.\nT14: Move DOWN to (5, 6) to grab the apple. We will then be at the center line, ready to patrol the middle-left quadrant and continue pressing the enemy. Our superior length (7 vs 5) will allow us to dominate the middle of the board and cut off access to the northern apples.\n\nLEFT",

We gotta put the pressure on the rival now!\n\n### Current Board State Review (T=13)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 7)\n*   Body: [(6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]\n*   Length: 6.

They are trying to hug the wall and stay low. Interesting move. They are running from the fight!\n*   Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n*   Length: 5. Score: 4.

They have two immediate goals: (1, 4) apple, or getting out from under their own body segments.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** APPLE! This is the most likely move. They grab an apple and increase their length and score.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe, but runs the risk of running into their own tail later, and no immediate apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe, but dead end instantly. Only really useful if they are trying to box *themselves* in for some reason.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** **DANGER!** Body collision! \ud83d\udc80\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **UP to (1, 4)**. They must go for the apple to catch our score.\n\n*Assume Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 4) and eats the apple.* Their head is now at (1, 4), and their length increases to 6. Score becomes 5-5. The score lead is gone, but we are prepared!\n\n### Our Strategy: Apple Grab and Central Wall Construction\n\nWe are at (5, 7). We have the (5, 6) apple RIGHT BELOW US. The plan is simple: GRAB THE APPLE (DOWN), and then start building the vertical wall at X=5.\n\n**Move Options from (5, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):**\n    *   Safe. Takes us away from the immediate objective.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** Score moves to 6-5. Length increases to 7. This is the goal!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Safe. Good for general board coverage, but skips the immediate apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Body collision! Our body is at (6, 7)! We just came from there! **DO NOT CRASH!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe clear, dominant move is **DOWN** to secure the apple, the lead, and the board dominance.\n\n### Head-to-Head Collision Check (If both move toward the same cell)\n\n*   Our target: (5, 6).\n*   Rival target (predicted): (1, 4).\n\nNo danger of a head-on collision. The enemy is in the far corner.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Choke Hold)\n\nT13: Move **DOWN** to (5, 6) (APPLE!). We are now 6-5 on apples, 7 segments long. This central position gives us incredible control.\nT14: We will be at (5, 6). The rival will likely be at (1, 4) or aiming to consolidate their position on the left. We need to decide whether to push HARD LEFT (X=4) to cut off the rival from the center, or maintain the X=5 wall (push DOWN to 5, 5). Moving to (5, 5) keeps us long and dangerous. If the rival is at (1, 4), they are heading towards (0, 4) or (2, 4) next.\n\nWe will focus on maintaining the center column (X=5) for now, potentially pushing for the (4, 4) apple next turn if the rival doesn't move toward the center. We need maximum length to crush the opposition.\n\nLet's execute the plan! **DOWN** for the apple! LFG CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

We are the superior snake, confirmed!\n\n### Current Board State Review (T=14)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n*   Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7)]\n*   Length: 7. Score: 6. We are locked into the center column (X=5) with great length.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 4) <-- Just as predicted! They managed to snag the apple at (1, 4). Good move, rival, but not good enough!\n*   Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n*   Length: 6. Score: 5. They are trapped in the lower-left corner by their own body and the edge of the board. PERFECT.\n\n**Board Snapshot:**\n 9 . A . A A . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . T T . .\n 7 . . A A . T T T T .  <- Our body starts here\n 6 . A A . . 1 A . . . <- Our head is here: (5, 6)\n 5 . . . . . A . . . .\n 4 . 0 . . A . . A . . <- Rival head is here: (1, 4)\n 3 . T T T . . . . . .\n 2 . . . T . . . . . .\n 1 . . . T . . A A . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Snake #0 Prediction from (1, 4)\n\nThe rival is at (1, 4). They are long (6 segments) and need to expand or get to more apples quickly to tie us.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** Safe expansion. No apple, but moves them out.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** **DANGER!** Body collision! Their body segment is at (1, 3)! Instant death! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, but runs the risk of getting stuck on the edge.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Safe, but this is the first step toward the center of the board. They are coming for the (4, 4) apple!\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (2, 4)**. This move gives them the most options for follow-up moves, including going for the (4, 4) apple, cutting across the board, or heading up toward the (2, 7) or (3, 7) apples. They need to get out of the corner!\n\n*Assume Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 4).* Their head is now at (2, 4).\n\n### Our Strategy: Build the Wall and Cut the Board\n\nWe are at (5, 6). We are controlling the center and have a length advantage (7 vs 6). We now need to decide on the best direction to force the enemy's next move.\n\nOur primary goal is to maintain pressure and secure the central territory. We have two key apples nearby: (4, 4) and (5, 5).\n\n**Move Options from (5, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Body collision! We just came from (5, 7)! We die if we reverse direction! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** A safe move that maintains our central wall structure (X=5). This is a strong move. It increases our score to 7-5, and length to 8. This is pure strength!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):**\n    *   Safe. Moves us one step closer to the rival, who is currently X=1/2/3. This allows us to start boxing them in against the X=0/1/2 zone. The (4, 4) apple is reachable in two moves if we go this way.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** This would give us huge volume and control on the right side of the board. It pulls us slightly away from the rival, but increases our score to 7-5 and length to 8, which is dominant.\n\n### Analyzing the Best Move\n\nIf we go **DOWN (5, 5)**:\n*   Pros: Immediate apple, maintaining central wall (X=5), increasing length to 8. Sets us up to push down toward (5, 4) or push LEFT to (4, 5) to contest the (4, 4) apple.\n*   Cons: Gives the rival more time to move into the board center from the left, especially if they are gunning for (4, 4) or (2, 7)/(3, 7).\n\nIf we go **LEFT (4, 6)**:\n*   Pros: Aggressive move toward the rival's predicted path (2, 4). Start building a wall at X=4/Y=4-7 limits their upward expansion. Sets us up for the (4, 4) apple.\n*   Cons: Skips two immediate apples: (5, 5) and (6, 6). The rival gains an advantage if we skip apples.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT (6, 6)**:\n*   Pros: Immediate apple! Very safe, gives us a massive lead (7-5 apples, length 8). Gives us more space and volume.\n*   Cons: Completely ignores the rival's position, letting them build safely on the left.\n\n**The Decision: Dominate the Center-Left and Grow!**\n\nThe rival is weak. They are at (1, 4), and expected to move (2, 4). The closest apple that directly pressures them is (4, 4). If we move to (5, 5) (Apple!), we deny them of the center Y=5-6 space, and put ourselves in position to grab (4, 4) next turn!\n\nMoving to (5, 5) gives us the undeniable board, score, and length advantage (7 vs 5 apples, 8 vs 6 length). This is undeniable power! We can then use our length to make a sweeping move (LEFT, then DOWN) to cut off the lower half of the board if the rival is slow to respond, or keep moving towards the (7, 4) apple in the bottom-right if they cut us off.\n\nHead-to-Head Collision Check:\n*   Our target: (5, 5)\n*   Rival target (predicted): (2, 4)\n*   No collision risk. We are safe!\n\nLet's do this! Grab the apple, secure the lead, maintain the center. **DOWN** is the power play!\n\n***\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T15)\n\nT14: Move DOWN to (5, 5) (APPLE!). Score 7-5. Length 8.\nT15: We are at (5, 5). Rival is likely at (2, 4) or (1, 5). We need to determine the optimal move to secure the (4, 4) apple and/or complete the X=5 vertical choke hold. If the rival moves toward the center (e.g., towards 4, 4), we must move LEFT to (4, 5) and then claim (4, 4) before them or block their path. If the rival moves UP the wall and away (1, 5), we continue DOWN the X=5 axis. For now, focus on the (4, 4) contest.\n\nDOWN",

We secured the apple, secured the central column, and now we are absolutely DOMINATING the board!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   **US (ID 1):** 7 apples. Length 8.

We have a powerful vertical wall at X=5.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 5) - Ah, rival! Last turn, they moved **UP** from (1, 4) to (1, 5). They didn't go for (4, 4) yet. They are trying to skirt the wall and avoid congestion in the bottom half. Smart, maybe? Now they are tightly packed against the left wall.\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\n*   They are basically trapped in the narrow Y=5-9 zone against the X=0/1 columns.

They are at (1, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):** (APPLE GRAB!) This is a highly likely, safe, and score-tying move. This gets them out of the corner slightly and boosts their score to 6.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 5):** Safe, but keeps them stuck on the edge. Bad move.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Safe expansion into the main board. Good move if they want to contest the (2, 6) or (2, 7) apples.\n\nPrediction: The opponent MUST pursue growth. They will attempt to move **UP to (1, 6)** to grab the apple. This is the obvious power move for them right now.\n\n*Assume Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 6).* Their head is now at (1, 6), score 6.\n\n### Our Strategy: Choke, Cut, and Dominate!\n\nWe are at (5, 5). We are long (8 segments) and the enemy is still short (6 segments). The entire left side of the board is now effectively their prison. We need to complete the seal.\n\nThe key targets for us are the apples at (4, 4), (7, 4), and (6, 6).\n\n**Move Options from (5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Body collision! We just came from (5, 6)! We die if we reverse direction! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Moves us further down our X=5 wall. Puts us in position to grab (7, 4) in the future.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safe. **THE CHOKE MOVE!** This cuts off the center-left. It puts our head just one move away from the crucial (4, 4) apple, preventing the rival from accessing the lower board if they move right. This is an aggressive block!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Keeps us wide open and puts us one move away from the (6, 6) apple. A strong *growth* option.\n\n### Analyzing the Best Move for Maximum Evisceration\n\nWe have a 7-5 lead. We need to secure the win by limiting the rival's space.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (6, 5)**:\n*   Pros: Sets us up for the (6, 6) apple next turn (score 8-6). We continue growing and maintain freedom.\n*   Cons: We allow the rival to potentially move right later (to 2, 5 or 3, 5) and try to slip past our X=5 wall in the center. They could go UP to (1, 6) (score 7-6), and then right to (2, 6), coming for the (3, 7) or (2, 7) apples. We lose central control.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (4, 5)**:\n*   Pros: **Blocks the rival's progress!** If the rival goes (1, 6), and then tries to come right to (2, 6), we are right there at (4, 5) ready to cut them off. More importantly, we are one move from the (4, 4) apple! If we grab (4, 4) next turn, our score is tied 8-6, and we've built a tight wall at X=4/5 for the enemy.\n*   Cons: We pass up the immediate (6, 6) apple.\n\n**The Decision: Aggressive Containment!**\n\nThe rival is at (1, 5) and likely going (1, 6). If we move LEFT to (4, 5), we are asserting undeniable control over the central board. If the rival dares to come right towards us (say, to (2, 5) this turn), we are in position for a potential head-on collision or, more likely, to beat them to the (4, 4) apple.\n\nLet's check the collision possibility if we move LEFT to (4, 5):\n*   Our Target: (4, 5)\n*   Rival Prediction (UP): (1, 6)\n*   Rival Alt Prediction (RIGHT): (2, 5)\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (2, 5), they are two horizontal spaces away. No collision. We are safe.\n\nOur goal now is to build a wall spanning from top to bottom, cutting the board in half. By moving into (4, 5), we start building the X=4 wall segment, complimenting our current X=5 wall segments. This will put the rival's head at (1, 6) in a narrow vertical strip (X=0-3). We are suffocating them!\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (4, 5). Next turn, grab (4, 4). This move is pure board dominance.\n\n***\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T16)\n\nT15: Move LEFT to (4, 5). Rival likely moves UP to (1, 6) (apple). Score 7-6. Length 8 vs 7.\nT16: We are at (4, 5). Rival is at (1, 6). We must move DOWN to (4, 4) (APPLE!). This extends our wall to the bottom, securing the center-low, and increases our length/score to 8-6 (Length 9 vs 7). The rival will be completely boxed into the upper-left quadrant (X=0-3, Y=6-9). We then hunt the right side apples. This is the winning strategy, Chat! EZ money!\n\nLEFT",

The momentum is 100% on our side!\n\n### T16 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 5)\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]\n*   We've built a strong north-south wall at X=5, and we're starting X=4. Domination station!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 6)\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\n*   Rival did exactly what we predicted: moved **UP** to (1, 6) and grabbed the apple! Good on them for staying alive, but they are absolutely *trapped* against the left wall.\n\n**Board Snapshot (T=16 Start):**\n 9 . A . A A . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . T T . .\n 7 . . A A . T T T . .\n 6 . 0 A . . T A . . . <- Rival Head (1, 6)\n 5 . T . . 1 T . . . . <- Our Head (4, 5)\n 4 . T . . A . . A . .\n 3 . T T T . . . . . .\n 2 . . . T . . . . . A\n 1 . . . A . . A A . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Rival Prediction: Where can Snake #0 go from (1, 6)?\n\nThey are severely limited. They have an apple right next to them at (2, 6).\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Safe, slow progression up the edge. Puts them near (2, 7).\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** Safe, but keeps them absolutely cornered. No growth potential.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** **APPLE!** (Score 7). This is the best move. It grants growth, and more importantly, moves them slightly away from the death border.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (2, 6)** to grab the apple. They are desperate for volume.\n\n### Our Strategy: Finish the Wall and Starve Them Out!\n\nWe are at (4, 5). We are one move away from the (4, 4) apple. This is the lynchpin of our defense. If we secure (4, 4), our wall spans X=4/5 from Y=4 up to Y=8. The opponent will be completely isolated in the top-left corner (0-3, 6-9).\n\n**Move Options from (4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   Safe. Puts us in the air, but it's not immediately useful. We ignore the (4, 4) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   **APPLE GRAB!** (Score 8-7). This is highly aggressive, safe (for us), and completes the containment wall. If the rival moves R to (2, 6), there is no collision risk. This is the optimal choke move!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Puts us dangerously close to the enemy's escape route, essentially daring them to move UP or DOWN into a collision, but they probably won't. This risks us reversing direction in a future move if we get trapped. Low priority.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **DANGER!** Body collision into our own body! (5, 5) is our second segment! \ud83d\udc80\n\n### Analysis of DOWN to (4, 4)\n\n*   **Safety Check:** We move to (4, 4). The rival is most likely moving from (1, 6) to (2, 6). No collision. We are safe.\n*   **Strategic Gain:** We eat the apple, increasing our lead to 8-7. Our snake length goes to 9. The rival's length goes to 8. We maintain the size advantage.\n*   **Positional Gain:** We anchor our board control at (4, 4). The rival is now totally confined by our extensive body wall. They have nowhere to go but to fight amongst the few remaining apples in their tiny territory ((2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 9), (1, 9)). This is the move to end their game!\n\n**The decision is clear: Dive for the apple, secure the wall, and box them in!** We are building the perimeter, Chat! We're not just playing Snake; we're playing chess!\n\n***\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T17)\n\nT16: Move DOWN to (4, 4) (APPLE!). Rival likely moves RIGHT to (2, 6) (APPLE!). Score 8-7. Length 9 vs 8.\nT17: We are at (4, 4). Rival is at (2, 6). We are too big now to spend time fighting over scraps with him. We pivot to the RIGHT side of the board for massive apple content: (7, 4), (6, 1), (7, 1). We should move RIGHT to (5, 4) or DOWN to (4, 3) (if safe). Since (5, 4) is perfectly safe and keeps us gliding along our wall, that is the best pivot move. We cede the left territory to starvation, and we go for the win on the right side.\n\nDOWN",

The plan is working!\n\n### T17 Board State Review\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 4)\n*   Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]\n*   We've built a solid wall at X=4/5! The opponent is absolutely contained on the left side.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (2, 6)\n*   Body: [(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]\n*   Rival moved from (1, 6) to (2, 6). They ate the apple, so they are now length 8, and the score is 8-7. Close enough to be dangerous, but they are absolutely cornered.\n\n**Board Snapshot (T=17 Start):**\n\n 9 . A . A A . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . T T . .\n 7 . . A A . T T T . .\n 6 . T 0 . . T A . . . <- Rival Head (2, 6)\n 5 . T . . T T . . . .\n 4 . T . A 1 . . A . . <- Our Head (4, 4)\n 3 . T T T . . . . . .\n 2 . . . T . . . . . A\n 1 . . . A . . A A . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Rival Prediction: Where can Snake #0 go from (2, 6)?\n\nThe rival is at (2, 6). The area is tight because we've sealed off (3, 6) and below.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** **APPLE!** (Score 8). This is the absolute best move for them. It grants growth and moves them into the last bit of open territory on the left side.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** Safe, reverses direction but puts their head right next to their body at (1, 5). Not a good move for growth or space.\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** **DANGER!** They would collide with our body segment at (4, 5) or (4, 4) or their own body at (1, 5) - actually, (2, 5) is open, but it's a dead end leading right into our wall. They are cutting themselves off. We discourage this, but it's *safe* for them momentarily.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** **DANGER!** (3, 6) is an open spot, but it is **blocked** by our tail at (3, 7) right now, which will move. Wait\u2014no, (3, 6) is open space. But if they move there, they are hugging the wall. It's a possible defensive move, but less appealing than the apple.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **UP to (2, 7)** to grab the apple and try to survive in the top-left corner.\n\n### Our Strategy: Glide and Dominate!\n\nWe are at (4, 4). We are firmly controlling the center. The rival is in a self-made prison. Do we go toward them, or do we ignore them and go for pure score domination?\n\nIf we chase them, we risk getting tangled in the small space *they* control, which could give them an out or lead to a risky head-to-head collision where we might lose.\n\nWe are already winning 8-7, and we are longer (9 vs 8). The right side of the board is WIDE open and holds huge amounts of apples: (7, 4), (6, 1), (7, 1), (9, 2), (8, 8). Time to pivot and build up an insurmountable lead!\n\n**Move Options from (4, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** **DANGER!** Collision with our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe. Keeps us along our wall. This is a very defensive move, but it's safe and opens up the south.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** **APPLE!** Grabs the (3, 4) apple. Score 9-7. This is tempting! It gives us growth and pushes our wall one step further left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safe. Keeps us along our wall, moving us toward the open east side. This is the start of the grand maneuver!\n\n### Analysis of Key Safe Moves:\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect. (5, 4) is open.\n*   **Strategic Gain:** This begins the shift toward the right side of the board. It keeps us anchored to our established wall (X=4/5) and positions us perfectly to grab (7, 4) soon. This is a big area domination move.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (3, 4) (APPLE!)**\n*   **Safety:** Perfect. (3, 4) is open.\n*   **Strategic Gain:** This is extremely aggressive! We grab another apple (9-7 lead) and cut off the rival's already limited movement entirely below Y=5. If the rival is at (2, 7) or (2, 6), they are now trapped 100% in the (0-3, 6-9) box. This is a decisive move.\n\n**Which is better: Aggressive Box-in (LEFT) or Score Dominance Pivot (RIGHT)?**\n\nIf we move LEFT, we guarantee that the rival will die within a few more turns from starvation or crash. We gain an apple AND space dominance.\nIf we move RIGHT, we abandon the immediate kill and go for a score lead, letting the rival starve on their own terms.\n\nSince we are already length 9 and the rival is length 8, and the apple at (3, 4) is right there... we should take it! This move completely removes the vertical strip at X=3 as an escape route and forces the rival to stay confined to X=0/1/2. They are toast!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 4):\n*   Head is at (3, 4).\n*   Score is 9-7. Length 10 vs 8. **HUGE lead!**\n\nLet's stick to the containment plan. We are bigger, we are winning, and we must choke them out! We eat this apple, solidify the wall, and *then* pivot to the right side if they somehow survive.\n\n*Self-Correction on Rival Crash Risk:* If the rival moves UP to (2, 7) and we move LEFT to (3, 4), there is no collision risk. We are safe, we grow, and we win the territory battle.\n\nThis is the move, Chat! We close the box!\n\n***\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for T18)\n\nT17: Move LEFT to (3, 4) (APPLE!). Rival likely moves UP to (2, 7) (APPLE!). Score 9-8. Length 10 vs 9.\nT18: We are at (3, 4). Rival is at (2, 7). The rival is now totally locked into the top left corner (X=0/1/2, Y=6-9). We can now safely pivot to the right side of the board. From (3, 4), we should move DOWN to (3, 3) (which is their tail!), or RIGHT to (4, 4), which is safe but reverses our direction. Since (3, 3) is their tail, and it will likely move to (3, 2), moving DOWN to (3, 3) is safe and keeps applying pressure. Better yet, we should look for (7, 4) and (7, 1). From (3, 4), we will move RIGHT to (4, 4) (or DOWN to (3, 3) if safe, assuming their tail moves). Actually, (3, 3) is *not* their tail; it's a body segment. Their tail is at (3, 2). Moving down to (3, 3) is safe assuming their tail moves out. Let's aim for the right side sweep. Right now, LEFT is the move.\n\nLEFT",

We are an absolute GOLIATH! The rival is DROWNING in the north-west corner!\n\n### T18 Board State Review: The Rival is Boxed!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 4)\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]\n*   Length: 10 segments.

They are totally sealed off by our body segments at X=4, and our head at (3, 4). The only escape route is up into the top-left area.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** Safe. Moves them into open territory, but still cornered. No apples nearby.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** Safe. Reverses direction, but their tail might still be blocking (at (3, 2) which moved to (2, 3) which moved to (1, 3)... wait, their tail is (3, 2). It moves off the board for them to grow). Reversing is a stalling maneuver.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 7):** Safe. Moves them along the top edge, toward the (1, 9) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):** **DANGER!** (3, 7) is occupied by our body segment (7, 7) which shifted. Wait, the *old* (7, 7) moved, and the segment at (4, 4) moved to (3, 4). Let's check our body list: the segments are [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]. The cell (3, 7) is NOT one of our body parts. It is open space! HOWEVER, moving to (3, 7) puts them right next to our head at (3, 4). It is a risky move, as it tries to break containment, but it's *safe* for them to move into.\n\nGiven the pressure, the rival will likely move **LEFT to (1, 7)** to maximize their space in the top-left corner, or **UP to (2, 8)**. They have to run from the wall we built.\n\n### Our Strategy: Pivot and Dominate the East!\n\nWe have successfully caged the rival. Now, we must build a score lead so massive that even if they manage a death move, we still win. The center-right and low-right areas are wide open!\n\nWe are at (3, 4). Our immediate goal is to get to the wide-open space on the right side of the board and secure the (7, 4) and (8, 8) apples.\n\n**Move Options from (3, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** Safe. Keeps us vertical, hugging the rival's prison wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** **DANGER!** (3, 3) is a body segment of the rival! Collision! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** Safe. Moves us closer to the rival's territory, risking getting tangled in the small space later. Not good for the current phase.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Safe. This is the spot our body just vacated! A perfect pivot move to start our eastward sweep.\n\n### Analysis of Best Safe Move: RIGHT\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (4, 4)** is the perfect transition.\n\n*   **Safety:** Perfect. (4, 4) is now open, as it was our body segment that moved to (3, 4).\n*   **Strategic Gain:** This immediately turns us toward the open half of the board. From (4, 4), we can aim for (5, 4), (6, 4), and then the (7, 4) apple. We are completely abandoning the chase, letting the rival slowly suffocate against our wall. This increases our score lead dramatically.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we open up space for our tail to continue moving down and right, giving us a massive trail across the board. The rival is pinned and irrelevant for a few turns. Time to farm!\n\nThe plan is set: **RIGHT, then keep going RIGHT toward (7, 4)!**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T19-T21)\n\nT18: Move RIGHT to (4, 4).\nT19: Move RIGHT to (5, 4).\nT20: Move RIGHT to (6, 4).\nT21: Move RIGHT to (7, 4) (APPLE!). Secure the lead!\n\nWe are going for total board domination, Chat! Let's get this dub!\n\nRIGHT",
