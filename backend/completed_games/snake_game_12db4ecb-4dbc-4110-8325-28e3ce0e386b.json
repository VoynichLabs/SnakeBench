This is very promising.\n\n- **LEFT (7, 1)**: Moves toward the apple at (3, 1). This is also promising and was my previous strategy.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n\nThe bottom row has 3 apples while the (3, 1) apple is just 1. Moving DOWN gets me to row 0 where I can sweep along collecting multiple apples. From (8, 0), I can then move LEFT to grab (5, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 0) in sequence.\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 9) is far away and moving/has moved. Even if it moves down, it won't interfere with my bottom-row collection strategy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 0) to position myself on the apple-rich bottom row\n2. Move LEFT along row 0: (8,0) \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 collect (5,0) \u2192 continue to (1,0) and (0,0)\n3. After collecting bottom row apples, move back up and right to grab (3, 1)\n4. Monitor enemy position for any threats\n\nDOWN",
