It could move toward you, but it's far away (distance of ~6 units), so no immediate threat.\n- No need to avoid the enemy in this move.\n\n### Best Move:\n- Moving **DOWN (y-1)** to (8, 2) is the best choice because:\n  1. It keeps you near the edge but moves you toward the center (lower y), where apples are.\n  2. It doesn\u2019t block future movement options.\n  3.

If it moves **UP** next turn, it could reach (4, 2), but this is not a direct threat to you.\n- No immediate collision risk with the enemy in any move.\n\n### Best Move:\n- Moving **UP** to **(4, 8)** is the best choice because:\n  1. It keeps your snake in a vertical alignment, making it easier to navigate toward the apple at (0, 8) in future turns.\n  2. Moving **UP** does not immediately threaten your snake or the enemy.\n  3. It maintains flexibility for future moves, as you can still pivot **LEFT** or **RIGHT** if needed.\n  4.

No immediate threat to you.\n- If the enemy moves **UP** or **DOWN**, it may not interfere with your path.\n- If the enemy moves **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, it could potentially create a threat if it grows and blocks your path.\n\n### Best Move:\n- Moving **DOWN** to **(3, 7)** is the optimal choice because:\n  1.

No immediate threat to you.\n- If the enemy moves **UP** or **DOWN**, it may not interfere with your path.\n- If the enemy moves **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, it could potentially create a threat if it grows and blocks your path.\n\n### Best Move:\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(2, 5)** is the optimal choice because:\n  1. It keeps you on a path toward the apple at (0, 3), which is currently the closest reachable apple.\n  2. It maintains flexibility for future moves (avoids getting trapped in a corner).\n  3. It allows you to explore the left side of the board, which is less crowded and has potential apples.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- After moving **LEFT** to (2, 5), your snake will occupy [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\n- Next turn, prioritize moving toward the apple at (0, 3) by continuing **LEFT** to (1, 5) or (0, 5) if safe, then pivoting **DOWN** to reach (0, 3).\n- Avoid moving into the top-right corner (where the enemy is) unless necessary to block its growth.\n- If the enemy starts moving aggressively toward your path, consider blocking its potential growth or forcing it into a dead-end.\n- Maintain flexibility to pivot toward the apple at (3, 1) or (2, 2) if other targets become unreachable or if the enemy interferes.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here would collide with enemy body).\n2. **DOWN (y-1):** (5, 2) - Invalid (backwards into your own body).\n3. **LEFT (x-1):** (4, 3) - Valid (no apple, no collision).\n4. **RIGHT (x+1):** (6, 3) - Invalid (backwards into your own body).\n\n### Safety Check:\n- Moving **UP** to (5, 4) is invalid due to collision with enemy body.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 3) is safe (no collision with own body or enemy).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 3) is invalid (backwards).\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- The apple at **(7, 4)** is reachable in two moves if you go **RIGHT** to (6, 3) and then **UP** to (7, 4), but (6, 3) is invalid as a move.\n- The apple at **(4, 8)** is far away.\n- The apple at **(5, 9)** is far away.\n- The apple at **(9, 2)** is far away.\n- The apple at **(0, 3)** is far away.\n\n### Enemy Movement:\n- Enemy head is at (6, 4) and body at (5, 4). If you move **LEFT** to (4, 3), the enemy could move **LEFT** to (5, 4) or **UP** to (6, 5). No immediate threat to you.\n\n### Best Move:\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(4, 3)** is the optimal choice because:\n  1. It avoids moving backwards into your own body.\n  2. It does not risk collision with the enemy.\n  3. It keeps your options open for future moves, as (4, 3) has multiple safe directions (e.g., **UP** to (4, 4), **LEFT** to (3, 3), or **DOWN** to (4, 2)).\n  4. It allows you to explore the area around (4, 3) without getting trapped.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- After moving **LEFT** to (4, 3), your snake will occupy [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)].\n- Next turn, prioritize moving **UP** to (4, 4) to explore the upper part of the board and potentially eat the apple at (7, 4) in the following turns.\n- Keep an eye on the apple at (4, 8) as it might become reachable if you move towards the upper-right corner.\n- Avoid unnecessary risks of head-on collisions with the enemy, but its current position does not pose an immediate threat.\n\nLEFT",
