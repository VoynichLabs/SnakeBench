Safe coordinates: $0 \\le x, y \\le 9$.\n\nApples: A1=(5, 4), A2=(1, 0), A3=(3, 5), A4=(9, 3), A5=(7, 6).\n\nTurn 0. All moves are simultaneous.\n\n**1. Analyze Own Potential Moves (Head starts at (2, 3))**\n\nMy possibilities: UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2), LEFT (1, 3), RIGHT (3, 3).\n\n*   **Self-Collision Check:** Since I have no body (length 1), no move can cause an immediate self-collision (hitting my own length > 1 body or moving backwards into the spot where my tail *would* have been, which doesn't apply yet).\n\n*   **Boundary Check:** All four moves are safely within the 0-9 range.\n\n*   **Enemy Collision Check (Head vs Head):**\n    *   Enemy Head E1 is at (9, 8).\n    *   If I move UP to (2, 4), E1 moves simultaneously. E1's possible moves are (8, 8), (9, 7), (9, 9), (10, 8 - out) or (9, 8) (if it reverses, which is usually suicidal unless its tail is there). Assuming rational play, E1 will move towards an apple or defensively. There is no immediate head-on collision risk at (2, 4) or any of my other potential landing spots $ (2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3) $ with E1's current position (9, 8).\n\n**2. Analyze Apple Proximity and Safety**\n\nThe nearest apples are:\n*   (1, 0) - Distance $\\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} \\approx 3.16$. Needs LEFT then 3 DOWNs, or 3 DOWNs then LEFT. Not immediately reachable.\n*   (3, 5) - Distance $\\sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 4} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. Closest approach seems to be UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP.\n*   (5, 4) - Distance $\\sqrt{(2-5)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 1} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$.\n\nLet's evaluate moves based on proximity to the closest apple, A3=(3, 5), and generally opening movement options.\n\nA. **Move: UP to (2, 4)**\n    *   Moves towards (3, 5).\n    *   Allows options: RIGHT to (3, 4) next turn, or UP to (2, 5).\n    *   Keeps access to the central area.\n\nB. **Move: RIGHT to (3, 3)**\n    *   Moves towards (3, 5).\n    *   Allows options: UP to (3, 4) or UP to (3, 5) (eating the apple) next turn if E1 doesn't block.\n    *   Keeps access to the central area.\n\nC. **Move: LEFT to (1, 3)**\n    *   Moves towards (1, 0).\n    *   Pulls away from the cluster of apples near the middle/top (3, 5), (5, 4), (7, 6).\n\nD. **Move: DOWN to (2, 2)**\n    *   Moves away from all current apples except potentially (1, 0), but it takes longer to reach that one than by going left first.\n\n**3. Considering the Enemy (Snake #1 at (9, 8))**\n\nSnake #1 is in the top-right corner. It is far from me and far from all apples except potentially A4=(9, 3) if it moves DOWN a lot, or A5=(7, 6) if it moves diagonally. Given its current position (9, 8), the closest apple is (7, 6). It will likely aim for (7, 6) or move away from the center board.\n\nSince the enemy is far and unlikely to immediately interfere with my pathfinding to the centralized apples, I should prioritize moving towards the closest appealing apple, which is (3, 5).\n\nTo reach (3, 5) from (2, 3):\n*   Path 1: RIGHT (to 3, 3), then UP (to 3, 4), then UP (to 3, 5). (3 turns total)\n*   Path 2: UP (to 2, 4), then RIGHT (to 3, 4), then UP (to 3, 5). (3 turns total)\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT achieve good progress towards (3, 5) and keep me central.\n\nIf I move **UP to (2, 4)**: Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (3, 4), setting up an apple grab.\nIf I move **RIGHT to (3, 3)**: Next turn, I can go UP to (3, 4), setting up an apple grab.\n\nBoth seem equally good, but moving UP slightly separates my head from my perceived body location (even though I have none yet) if I eventually start moving in circles, and it moves me horizontally adjacent to the position above the target apple.\n\nLet's choose **UP** as it leads directly towards the Y-coordinate of the cluster center and prepares for the next step towards (3, 5). This seems like a balanced opening move, keeping options open.\n\nLong-term note: Focus on apples near the center/top-left quadrant first: (3, 5), (5, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for future turns:**\n1. Secure the apple at (3, 5) by moving towards it over the next 2-3 turns (UP/RIGHT sequence).\n2. Evaluate snake positions after the first apple is eaten (I will be length 2).\n3. Keep clear of the boundaries and monitor Snake #1's movement, although it seems currently non-threatening.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nUP",

This suggests Snake #1 chose RIGHT, which resulted in death or the game rules handle out-of-bounds moves differently.**\n\nRevisiting standard competitive snake rules: moving off the board results in death. If Snake #1 moved RIGHT from (9, 8), it died. Let's assume the game reported state is accurate based on *surviving* moves, or that the coordinates shown for the enemy reflect their *intended* move which may have been truncated.\n\nHowever, looking at the standard board indexing (0-9):\nIf E1 was at (9, 8), a RIGHT move leads to (10, 8). If the game interprets this as death, Snake #1 should be gone.\n\nLet's assume the board state provided *is* the result of valid (or semi-valid) simultaneous moves.\n\nIf E1 moved from (9, 8) and ended up at (10, 7) (as reported in the setup): This is impossible unless the rules allow movement outside the 10x10 boundary, which is specified $0 \\le x, y \\le 9$.\n\n**Crucial Re-evaluation based on provided *new* state:**\nYour Head: (2, 4).

(Mistake in my previous rationale reading the input, which said (9, 9) in the text block, but the visualization showed nothing at 9,9 related to E1).\n\nLet's re-read the input for Turn 1:\n> Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (9, 9), Body: none, Apples: 0\n\nMy move was UP to (2, 4). My body became (2, 3).\n\nIf E1 moved from (9, 9) to (10, 7) (as inferred from the *current* Turn 2 setup): This is impossible if E1 died by going off-board.\n\n**If the game engine reported (10, 7) and (9, 8) for Snake #1:**\n1. The game engine might handle boundaries by wrapping (unlikely based on rules description).\n2. The move RIGHT (from 9, 9) results in death. If E1 died, Snake #1 shouldn't exist now.\n3. The move DOWN (from 9, 9) results in (9, 8). This matches E1's reported body position.\n4. If E1 moved DOWN to (9, 8), what was its head move? If it moved to (10, 7) that's illegal.\n\n**ASSUMPTION BASED ON COMMON SNAKE AI PRACTICE:** When the opponent's reported position seems illegal (like (10, 7)), it usually means the opponent died or the previous move was intended to be towards a specific target. Since (9, 8) is present in the current state, E1 likely moved DOWN from (9, 9) to (9, 8) and maybe *another* part of its move caused instability, or the provided coordinate is simply erroneous/confusing.\n\n**Crucially: I survived. My body is now (2, 4), (2, 3).**\n\nLet's assume Snake #1 is still alive, positioned at Head (H?) and Body segment (9, 8). If it had length 2, it moved from (H_old, 9, 9).\nIf E1 moved DOWN: New Head at (9, 8). Old Head (9, 9) becomes the new body segment. This contradicts the reported E1 body being (9, 8).\n\n**Let's strictly follow the provided current state for Turn 2, ignoring the apparent anomaly from Turn 1:**\nMy Head: (2, 4). Body: (2, 3). Target Apples nearby: A3=(3, 5), A1=(5, 4).\nEnemy #1: Head H1 at (10, 7) [Assume this means H1 is dead or the state means something else], Body B1 at (9, 8).\n\n*If the enemy head is truly at (10, 7), Snake #1 is dead due to boundary violation, and I win immediately (if there are no other enemies).*\nSince the rules state: \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win,\" this situation (Head at (10, 7)) implies I should win, UNLESS the game engine is just poorly reporting the state, and E1 is still alive and dangerous.\n\nTo be safe, I will proceed as if E1 is still active and dangerous, possibly having moved into (9, 8) or intending to. If E1 is at (9, 8) (its body location), it must have moved from (9, 9) to (9, 8) or (8, 9) or (10, 9) or (9, 10) [illegal] or (8, 8) or (10, 8) [illegal]. The segment (9, 8) suggests a move towards the bottom right.\n\n**Let's assume E1 is alive and its actual head is dangerously close, e.g., at (8, 8) or (9, 7), and (9, 8) is its NEW head position if it moved from (9, 9) and *that* move was illegal, creating the current state.** This is too complex. I must rely on the simplest interpretation: **If I am alive and the enemy position implies a boundary violation, I should prioritize surviving and moving towards apples, trusting the survival condition will resolve at the end of the turn processing.**\n\n**Current Safety Check (Head at (2, 4), Body: (2, 3))**\n1. **Boundary:** Safe moves: (2, 5), (2, 3) [backwards, dangerous], (1, 4), (3, 4).\n2. **Self Collision:** Moving BACKWARDS to (2, 3) is hitting my own body segment. **DOWN is an illegal move.**\n3. **Available Safe Moves from (2, 4):** UP (2, 5), LEFT (1, 4), RIGHT (3, 4).\n\n**Apple Targets:** A3=(3, 5) is the primary target, followed by A1=(5, 4).\n\n*   **Move A: UP to (2, 5)**\n    *   Progresses towards (3, 5) vertically. Next move can be RIGHT to (3, 5).\n    *   If I move UP, my sequence to the apple is: (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) [Eat]. 2 turns.\n\n*   **Move B: RIGHT to (3, 4)**\n    *   Progresses towards (3, 5) horizontally. Next move can be UP to (3, 5).\n    *   If I move RIGHT, my sequence to the apple is: (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 5) [Eat]. 2 turns.\n\n*   **Move C: LEFT to (1, 4)**\n    *   Moves away from the central cluster, towards A2=(1, 0). Less optimal initially.\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\nBoth lead directly to the apple in 2 turns.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4), my body becomes (2, 4).\nIf I move UP to (2, 5), my body becomes (2, 4).\n\nIn a standard snake game, moving towards the target apple is paramount when path length is equal. There is no immediate threat from E1 that dictates a specific lateral or vertical bias. RIGHT moves me closer to X=3 which leads to the apple coordinate (3, 5). UP moves me closer to Y=5. Both are equally valid first steps from (2, 4) towards (3, 5).\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT** to advance the X coordinate, as I just advanced the Y coordinate last turn (UP). This provides better balance across coordinates.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4):\nNext turn I move UP to (3, 5) and eat the apple.\n\n**Enemy Check (Assuming E1 is somehow alive and its intended head direction was problematic last turn):**\nIf E1's head is truly off-board (e.g., 10, 7), it might cause an issue with the game logic, but it doesn't pose a threat to me at (3, 4). If E1's move resulted in its head landing at (9, 8) (its body segment currently), then I would have died by running into it IF my move was UP/LEFT/RIGHT to (9, 8) or DOWN to (9, 8). Since I am moving to (3, 4), I am safe from collision with (9, 8).\n\nI will proceed with the optimal pathfinding to grab Apple (3, 5).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat (3, 5) next turn. Then evaluate path to (5, 4). Maintain central position away from boundaries.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy current state (Turn 2 results):\nHead H=(3, 4).

Information Block (T=1 state, my T=1 choice: UP).\n2. **--Your last move information:--** (This is the result of my T=1 choice).\n3. **START/END PICK/RATIONALE** (This is the rationale *for* my T=1 choice).\n4. **--End of your last move information.--**\n5. **New Turn Info (T=2 State)**\n\nThe initial setup states:\n> Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 4), Body: none.\n\nMy T=1 choice was UP. Resulting Head: (2, 4) + UP = (2, 5).\nBut the T=2 setup explicitly states:\n> Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 4), Body: none.\nThis implies my T=1 move resulted in *no change* or my selection of UP was *ignored* or that I made an illegal move that forced me to stay put.\n\n**BUT WAIT:** The T=2 setup also shows:\n> Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 4), Body: none.\n> **--Your last move information:--** UP was chosen.\n\nIf the board state visualisation right before choosing T=2 move is:\nHead (2, 4), Body: none (Length 1). This completely contradicts my T=1 choice of UP leading to growth or movement.\n\n**I MUST TRUST THE STATE PRESENTED FOR TURN 2, which implies my last move (UP) resulted in the head staying at (2, 4) and no body forming.** This usually happens if the previous move was disallowed (e.g., self-collision on the target cell or boundary violation), but UP is legal from (2, 3).\n\nLet's review the state provided for T=2:\nApples: (5, 4), (1, 0), (3, 5), (9, 3), (7, 6)\nYour Snake (ID: 0): Head: (2, 4), Body: none. (Length 1)\nSnake #1: Head: (9, 9), Body: none. (Length 1)\n\nIf this state is correct, it means whatever happened in Turn 1, both snakes are now length 1, at (2, 4) and (9, 9). This effectively resets the board state comparison, except for the apples eaten count (which is 0 for both).\n\n**This implies I restart my planning from (2, 4) with length 1, ignoring the previous logic trace based on the flawed transition logging.**\n\nNew State Analysis (T=2):\nH = (2, 4).

(3, 5): $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$. (Requires 1 UP, 1 RIGHT or 1 RIGHT, 1 UP)\n2. (5, 4): $\\sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = 3$. (Requires 3 RIGHTs)\n\nTarget selection: (3, 5) is clearly the closest apple.\n\nPossible moves from (2, 4): UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3), LEFT (1, 4), RIGHT (3, 4). All safe regarding boundaries and zero body.\n\n*   **Move A: UP to (2, 5).** Next turn can be RIGHT to (3, 5) and eat. (2 turn approach).\n*   **Move B: RIGHT to (3, 4).** Next turn can be UP to (3, 5) and eat. (2 turn approach).\n\nEnemy E1 at (9, 9) is far away and moves towards A5(7, 6) or A4(9, 3). No immediate threat.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are equally optimal path choices towards (3, 5). I favored UP in my reasoning path last time (which led to the confusing result), and RIGHT now for balance. I will stick to advancing the X coordinate this time.\n\nMove: RIGHT to (3, 4).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move RIGHT to (3, 4) this turn.

I would win.\n\n**However, the game continued to Turn 6, and reported my score as 2 and E1 score 0.**\nThis means that on Turn 5, **I ate an apple and E1 did not impact me.**\n\nHow did I get Score 2?\nMy score before T5 was 1 (from A3=(3, 5) eaten at T3).

For my move RIGHT from (4, 5) to eat an apple, the apple must be at (5, 5).\n\nLet's recheck Apple locations listed at T=5 setup: (5, 4), (1, 0), (3, 5), (9, 3), (7, 6). **(5, 5) is NOT an apple location.**\n\n**Conclusion on State Discrepancy:** The provided game output logs seem to report scores that do not align with the prescribed move chosen or the apple locations listed, especially regarding the collision scenario.\n\n**I must rely on the T=6 state provided as ground truth for planning T=6:**\nMy Head: (5, 5). Body: (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3). Length: 6. Score: 2.\nE1 Head: (5, 5). Body: (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9). Length: 5. Score: 0.\n\n**If both heads landed on (5, 5), and the score jumped to 2 for me, this implies:**\n1. E1 died instantly due to collision/boundary issue. (If E1 died, I win if no other snakes).\n2. I ate an apple that coincidentally landed at (5, 5) *or* the game mechanism scored me based on a move that was *intended* to hit an apple, even if the resulting position (5, 5) isn't listed as an apple location.\n\nSince the game continued, assume E1 died by collision with me at (5, 5), and I survived AND magically gained a point count, possibly for proximity or simply stabilizing. Since S1=0, E1 likely died, and I am the sole survivor (+1 win condition activation?).\n\n**Winning Condition Check:** \"If all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\nIf E1 died this turn (T=5), I should have won at the end of T=5 processing. Since we are starting T=6, this implies E1 is *not* dead, OR the win condition check is delayed until the very end of the turn cycle, and E1's state needs to be re-evaluated.\n\nGiven E1's head is reported at (5, 5) *now* (Start of T=6), this means E1 survived the collision as well, perhaps the game handles head-to-head collision by having both snakes move, and then resolving body collisions? That contradicts the rule: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die\".\n\n**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** The information provided for T=6 (H=(5, 5), E1 H=(5, 5)) implies the collision happened, but *neither snake died*, and perhaps the apple consumption logic (Score=2) must be derived from T=5 successful moves.\n\nLet's assume E1 is still alive, and we are now at $H=(5, 5)$, Body $B=(4, 5), \\dots$. E1 is at $H1=(5, 5)$, Body $B1=(6, 6), \\dots$.\n\n**Safety Check (Head at (5, 5), Body: (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3))**\n1. **Boundary:** Safe.\n2. **Self Collision:** Tail is (2, 3).\n   *   UP to (5, 6): Safe.\n   *   DOWN to (5, 4): This is Apple A1! If I move DOWN, I eat A1. **Score must become 2 if I eat A1**.\n   *   LEFT to (4, 5): **Collision with Body (4, 5). ILLEGAL.**\n   *   RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe.\n\n**Conflict Check:** E1 Head is at (5, 5). If I move DOWN to (5, 4), I survive. If E1 moves/dies, that's resolved.\nIf E1 also simultaneously moves from (5, 5), say RIGHT to (6, 5). Then my move DOWN to (5, 4) is safe from E1 directly.\n\n**Apple Target:** A1=(5, 4) is available if I move DOWN. This perfectly explains the Score=2 change (1 from T3 + 1 from T5 move landing on A1).\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN to (5, 4) to eat A1, which also fixes my score discrepancy (assuming A1 was eaten last turn).\n\nIf (5, 4) was eaten last turn (T5), my head must have landed there.\nH_old=(4, 5). If I moved DOWN to (4, 4), I didn't eat. If I moved RIGHT to (5, 5), I didn't eat.\n\nThe only way Score=2 is true AND I am at (5, 5) is if the game state transition implies:\n1. T5 Move: I moved RIGHT to (5, 5). E1 moved to (5, 5). Both survived the head collision somehow, *and* I ate an apple that was magically positioned at (5, 4) but somehow credited upon reaching (5, 5) in the collision resolution process? This is highly confusing.\n\n**Let's trust the current state H=(5, 5), Score=2, E1 H=(5, 5), Score=0.** This implies E1 died in the collision, and I survived AND gained a point. If E1 died, I win immediately!\n\nIf I won at T5, the game shouldn't proceed to T6 setup unless the win condition check is only done once at the end of the turn cycle, and E1's survival state is pending resolution.\n\nGiven the game is forcing me to pick a move for T=6, I must assume E1 is somehow still alive, or the win condition hasn't triggered yet, or E1 is now effectively dead but its remnants are still on the board (which is what H1=(5, 5) and body implies).\n\n**Strategy: Assume the game proceeds, E1 is incapacitated (stuck at head location), and focus on clearing the remaining apples.**\n\nRemaining Apples: A2(1, 0), A4(9, 3), A5(7, 6).\nA5=(7, 6) is the next closest one, roughly 2 steps away (Right, Up).\n\nFrom H=(5, 5):\nIllegal: LEFT (to 4, 5).\nLegal: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), RIGHT (6, 5).\n\nMove RIGHT to (6, 5) moves towards A5(7, 6) fastest. (1 step R, then 1 step U).\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT to (6, 5). If E1 is dead and I win, this irrelevant. If E1 is alive but stuck, I should exploit its static position.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move RIGHT to (6, 5). Next turn, move UP to (6, 6) if safe, or perhaps slightly diagonally towards (7, 6). Monitor the status of E1's head at (5, 5). If it remains there next turn, I am safe to maneuver.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nTurn: 7 / 150\n\nApples at: (5, 4), (1, 0), (3, 5), (9, 3), (7, 6)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 2\n  - Snake #1 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (6, 5)\n  - Body: (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3)\n  - Apples collected: 2\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (6, 5), Body: (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n 8 . . . . . . . .

The collision at T5 resolved by E1 dying, but E1's body somehow persisted, and E1 moved AGAIN from its previous valid segment location to (6, 5), *or* perhaps E1's head survived T5 only to reach (6, 5) and collide again.\n3. Crucially: My body segmentation implies I successfully moved from (5, 5) to (6, 5) and grew/maintained structure, while E1's body configuration suggests it moved from (5, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 7) -> ...\n\nLet's look at E1's body transitions implied by T6 -> T7 transition:\nT6 E1 H=(5, 5), B=(6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9). (Length 5)\nT7 E1 H=(6, 5), B=(5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9). (Length 6)\nThis means E1 moved RIGHT from (5, 5) to (6, 5), and its tail (9, 9) was preserved because it didn't eat.\n\nIf E1 moved RIGHT to (6, 5), and I moved RIGHT to (6, 5), this is a collision where both survived, and *I* grew a segment (my body T1 moved to 5, 5 which is E1's old head spot), and E1 grew a segment (its tail 9, 9 was preserved). This contradicts the \"both die\" rule, but it explains the movement and growth consistency, suggesting this platform does *not* enforce strict death on head collision if the snakes move *away* from the collision point in the *next* turn.\n\n**Safety Check (Head at (6, 5), Body: (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3). Length 7)**\nTail is (2, 3).\n1. **Boundary:** Safe.\n2. **Self Collision:**\n   *   UP to (6, 6): Safe.\n   *   DOWN to (6, 4): Safe.\n   *   LEFT to (5, 5): **Collision with Body (5, 5). ILLEGAL.**\n   *   RIGHT to (7, 5): Safe.\n\n**Legal Moves:** UP (6, 6), DOWN (6, 4), RIGHT (7, 5).\n\n**Enemy Check:** E1 Head is at (6, 5) (This is the cell I just exited). E1 is now at (6, 5). If E1 is still at (6, 5), moving to (6, 6) (UP) is the only move that avoids landing where E1 seems stuck or is currently residing.\n\n**WAIT: If H=(6, 5) and H1=(6, 5) at the start of T7, then my move RIGHT to (7, 5) conflicts with E1 moving UP to (6, 6), or DOWN to (6, 4), or LEFT to (5, 5).**\n\nIf the state provided for T7 is the configuration *after* my T6 move (RIGHT), then H=(6, 5) and H1=(6, 5) means the collision happened *this turn* (T6), and my move UP is for T7.\n\n**Let's assume the provided T7 state reflects the configuration AT THE START OF TURN 7:**\nI am at (6, 5). E1 is at (6, 5). This is an impossible static reflection of simultaneous movement unless one or both died and their head persisted for reporting.\n\nIF E1 is currently sharing my head position (6, 5), and my move UP leads to (6, 6), I must check if E1 moves to (6, 6) too.\n\nE1 Body: (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9). Length 6. Tail (9, 9) is preserved.\nE1's potential moves from (6, 5):\n UP to (6, 6). (Hits its own body segment T1=(6, 6) IF it didn't eat this turn).\n DOWN to (6, 4).\n LEFT to (5, 5). (Hits its own body segment T1=(5, 5)).\n RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\nIf E1 cannot move safely, it might die or stay put. If E1 stays put at (6, 5), then I must move away to (6, 6) (UP) or (6, 4) (DOWN) or (7, 5) (RIGHT).\n\n**Apple Target:** A5=(7, 6) is the closest remaining apple.\n\nPath to A5(7, 6) from H=(6, 5):\n1. UP to (6, 6).\n2. RIGHT to (7, 6) [Eat]. (2 moves total).\n\nThis path is extremely appealing as it maximizes the return for minimal steps.\n\n**Move UP to (6, 6):**\nThis sets me up to eat A5 next turn.\nIf E1 is stationary at (6, 5), this is safe.\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (7, 5), this is safe.\nIf E1 moves UP towards (6, 6), we collide, which is catastrophic.\n\nE1's body seems to lead it diagonally away from the center. If E1 moved based on its body history: (5, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 7) -> ...\nIf E1's head (6, 5) moves UP to (6, 6), it hits its own body segment T1=(6, 6). **Therefore, E1 cannot likely move UP.**\n\nE1's legal moves from (6, 5) seem constrained to DOWN (6, 4) or RIGHT (7, 5) since LEFT hits (5, 5) and UP hits (6, 6).\n\nIf E1 moves DOWN or RIGHT, my move UP to (6, 6) is safe and positions me perfectly for the apple.\n\nDecision: Move UP to (6, 6).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move UP to (6, 6). Next turn, move RIGHT to (7, 6) to eat A5. Remaining apples A2(1, 0) and A4(9, 3) are far.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nTurn: 8 / 150\n\nApples at: (5, 4), (1, 0), (3, 5), (9, 3), (7, 6)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 3\n  - Snake #1 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (6, 6)\n  - Body: (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3)\n  - Apples collected: 3\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (7, 5), Body: (6, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . 1\n 8 . . . . . . . .

This is adjacent to A5=(7, 6) diagonally, but does not land on an apple.\n\n**CRITICAL RE-EVALUATION OF SCORE:**\nIf Score=3, I must have eaten 2 apples between T3 and T7.\nT5: My rationale suggested aiming for (5, 4) and my score result implies I got one. If I ate (5, 4) at T5, my move must have been DOWN to (5, 4) from (5, 5) IF my move wasn't based on the required T6 move.\n\nSince I am locked into the sequence of provided initial moves (UP, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT), I must trust the resulting HEAD position and SCORE.

Given E1's move, A5 seems more relevant.\n\n**New Apple Targets:** A1=(5, 4) - seems slightly contested by E1 movement towards (7, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) segment trace backwards if E1 ate.

Since (6, 5) is blocked/dangerous, moving towards A1 is now hard.\n\nPath to A4(9, 3): Requires significant rightward movement.\n\n**E1 Threat Assessment:** E1 is now forming a defensive wall or trapping me diagonally. H1=(7, 5) is close to my neck area (6, 5).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I am essentially moving along the edge of E1's reach, towards the corner apples, but slightly away from A1=(5, 4).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 7), I move into open space, getting ready to sweep down towards A5 (if it respawned?) or A4.\n\nSince A1=(5, 4) is difficult due to intersection with E1's influence zone/body remnants, prioritizing safety and moving into open space towards the more isolated A4 seems prudent, especially given E1 is heavily concentrated centrally.\n\nMove UP to (6, 7).
