Going down seems safest currently, and I can then consider a move to the left on the next turn to get closer to the (5,6) apple.\n\nDOWN",

The snake's body is now: `[(8, 2), (8, 3)]`. Enemy snake 1 is at (5, 1). The apples remaining are: (9, 7), (3, 7), (9, 0), (5, 6), (2, 8).\n\nHere's my thinking:\n\n*   **Right:** Moving to (9, 2) is dangerous. There's an apple at (9,0) and (9, 7), so if I move there, the enemy could get to those apples.\n*   **Left:** Moving to (7, 2) is a safe, but less rewarding move.\n*   **Up:** Moving to (8, 3). Not surrounded by anything of interest, and relatively safe from Snake 1. Could continue to build length.\n*   **Down:** Moving to (8, 1). Again, not much of interest. Could continue to build length.\n\nSince I just ate an apple and grew, I want to prioritize expanding my snake and consolidating my position. Right now, movement upwards seems more advantageous, as it will incrementally build my snake's length. Consolidating my position opens opportunities for getting more apples.\n\nUP",

This takes me further away from Snake 0 and potentially towards the apple at (3, 7).\n* **RIGHT:** (6, 7). Puts me in Snake 0's direct path.
