          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We are LIVE and ready to box this rival in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's assess the battlefield. Turn 0 of 150. We're both at 0 apples, heads at (8,5) for us and (3,2) for the enemy. Board is 10x10, apples are scattered. We need to play aggressive, grow fast, and force a head-on collision if we can get a lead.\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate immediate death moves.**\n- Board boundaries: x from 0-9, y from 0-9.\n- Our body: none (only head). So no self-collision except moving backwards into previous cell? But since we have no body, moving \"backwards\" isn't defined. We'll treat it as safe if we don't hit anything.\n- Enemy body: none. So no collision there.\n- Apples: we can eat them, grow, get points.\n\nLet's check each direction from head (8,5):\n\n- **UP**: to (8,6). Within board. No body. No enemy body. Enemy head at (3,2) far away. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: to (8,4). Within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: to (7,5). Within board. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: to (9,5). Within board. Safe.\n\nAll four directions are safe! So we need to choose based on strategy.\n\n**Step 2: Consider apples and positioning.**\nWe want to grow quickly to dominate the board. Look at apples: (8,1) is directly below us? Wait, (8,1) is an apple. We're at (8,5). If we go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn we could go DOWN to (8,3) and then (8,2), (8,1) eventually. But (8,1) is an apple. However, there are apples closer? (8,2) is an apple too! Actually from the board state: row 5 has \" . . . . . . . . 1 A \" meaning at (8,5) is us, (9,5) is apple A. So apple at (9,5) is RIGHT from us. Also apple at (8,1) is DOWN.\n\nBut we also need to consider the enemy. They are at (3,2). They will move simultaneously. We don't know their move, but we can anticipate. We want to avoid head-on collisions unless we have higher score (we're tied 0-0, so not higher). Actually, if we have same score, head-on collision results in both dying? The rules: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\" So if both die in head-on, it's a draw (0-0). That's not a win. We want to win, so we should avoid mutual death unless we have a lead.\n\nThus we want to move in a way that keeps us safe from enemy heads potentially moving into our path.\n\nAlso, we need to \"box him in\" meaning trap him so he crashes. We need to plan ahead.\n\n**Long-term plan:** We want to control the center and edges. Since we are at (8,5) and enemy at (3,2), we are on the right side. We could try to move toward the left to intercept him, but that might take many turns. Alternatively, we can eat apples on the right side to grow faster, then later chase him.\n\nBut note: apples are scattered. There's an apple at (9,5) RIGHT, (8,1) DOWN, (8,2) DOWN, (6,6) diagonally, etc.\n\nLet's list apples near us:\n- (9,5): adjacent RIGHT.\n- (8,2): two steps DOWN.\n- (8,1): three steps DOWN.\n- (6,6): not adjacent.\n- (8,8): top right.\n\nIf we go RIGHT now to (9,5), we eat that apple immediately (+1 point, grow). That's great! But is it safe? We move to (9,5). Enemy is far. No collision. However, after eating, our head moves to (9,5) and we grow. Our tail stays at (8,5) initially? Actually, if we eat, we grow by 1 segment. Since we have no body, after moving to (9,5) and eating, our body becomes: new head at (9,5), old head at (8,5) becomes body? The snake list is head-to-tail. Initially head at (8,5), body none, tail is same as head? Actually, if body is none, the tail is the same as head? Typically snake has head and body segments. If no body, the tail is at the head? But the rules say \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" So if there is no body, the list is just [(8,5)]? That means tail is also (8,5). When we move, we add new head, and if we didn't eat, we remove the tail. If we eat, we keep the tail (grow). So after moving to (9,5) and eating, the list becomes [(9,5), (8,5)] with tail at (8,5). That's fine.\n\nBut we need to consider if moving RIGHT to (9,5) is a dead end? (9,5) is at the right edge. From there, we can only go LEFT (to (8,5) which is our body now), UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4). Those are available if not occupied. So not a dead end immediately, but we might get trapped if we stay on edge.\n\nAlternatively, going DOWN to (8,4) or (8,3) could lead us to apples at (8,2) and (8,1). But (8,1) is at bottom edge. That might be a dead end. Also, there is an apple at (8,2) which is two down, and (8,1) one more down. If we go DOWN, we can eat multiple apples quickly? But we have to be careful not to trap ourselves.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy's potential moves. They are at (3,2). They might go for apples too. There are apples at (2,4), (3,1), (3,6), (1,4), etc. They might move up or right.\n\nWe want to eventually force a head-on collision. For that, we need to have a higher score. So we need to collect apples faster than them.\n\nLet's count apples we can reach quickly:\n- RIGHT: apple at (9,5) in 1 move.\n- DOWN: apples at (8,2) and (8,1) in 2-3 moves.\n- UP: (8,6) no apple, (8,7) no apple, (8,8) apple but 3 moves up.\n- LEFT: (7,5) no apple, (6,5) no apple, etc.\n\nSo RIGHT gives immediate apple. That seems best for early growth. But we also need to think about future mobility. If we go RIGHT, we are at (9,5). From there, we can go UP to (9,6) which has an apple? Actually (9,6) is an apple (from list: (9,6) is an apple). Wait, (9,6) is in the apple list? Yes, (9,6) is an apple. So if we go RIGHT to (9,5) and eat, then next turn we could go UP to (9,6) and eat another apple! That's two apples in two turns. That's great.\n\nBut is (9,6) safe? It's on the edge as well. After eating (9,6), we would be at (9,6) and our body would be: head (9,6), body (9,5), tail (8,5) if we grew from (9,5)? Actually, after first move, we ate so body = [(9,5), (8,5)]. After second move UP to (9,6) and eating, we would have [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5)] with tail still (8,5). That's fine.\n\nThen from (9,6), we could go DOWN back to (9,5) but that's our body, so not allowed. We could go LEFT to (8,6) (if free), or UP to (9,7). (9,7) is within board, no apple? (9,7) not listed as apple. So we have options.\n\nBut what about the enemy? They might be growing too. We need to track them.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns if we go RIGHT:\n\nTurn 0: We at (8,5), enemy at (3,2).\nWe move RIGHT to (9,5) and eat apple. Score: 1-0.\nEnemy moves? Unknown. Let's assume they might move to an apple. There's apple at (3,1) below them? (3,1) is apple. They could move DOWN to (3,1) and eat, scoring 1. Or move RIGHT to (4,2) no apple. Or UP to (3,3) no apple. Or LEFT to (2,2) no apple. So they might go DOWN to (3,1). If they do, they score.\n\nNow Turn 1: We at (9,5), body (8,5). Enemy at (3,1) maybe, body none? They ate so body (3,2)? Actually if they moved DOWN to (3,1) and ate, their head is (3,1), body (3,2) (since they grow). So body length 1.\n\nNow we can move UP to (9,6) and eat another apple (9,6). Score 2-1. Enemy might move to another apple, say (3,6) or (2,4) etc.\n\nWe need to ensure we don't crash. If enemy moves towards us, we might be safe because we are far.\n\nAlternatively, if we go DOWN first to (8,4), we don't eat apple immediately. That might be slower. But going DOWN might allow us to go to (8,3) then (8,2) eat apple, then (8,1) eat apple. That's two apples in three moves, but we could also go RIGHT later.\n\nGiven the apple at (9,5) is adjacent, and also (9,6) is adjacent to (9,5), going RIGHT gives two quick apples. That seems better.\n\nBut we must also consider that moving to the edge might limit our movement. However, with a growing body, we might be able to maneuver. The board is 10x10, we have plenty of space.\n\nAlso, we need to consider the enemy's head movement. They might try to cut us off. But they are far.\n\nLet's check for any immediate danger: If we go RIGHT, is there any chance the enemy could move into (9,5) simultaneously? Their head is at (3,2). In one turn, they can move at most 1 step. The Manhattan distance is |3-9| + |2-5| = 6+3=9. So they cannot reach (9,5) in one turn. So safe.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (8,4), also safe.\n\nBut we should also think about the long-term trap. \"Box him in\" means we want to surround him. That might require us to control the center and prevent his escape. Since we are on the right, we could move leftwards eventually to cut off his escape routes. However, if we grow too fast on the right, we might not be able to turn back easily because our body will be long. But we can plan to turn left later.\n\nGiven the apple at (9,5) is right there, and (9,6) also apple, I think going RIGHT is a strong opening to get a score lead. Once we have a lead, we can force head-on collisions.\n\nBut we need to be careful: if we go RIGHT, we eat apple. Then next turn we go UP to (9,6) eat apple. Then we have two apples, and our body is along the right edge. From there, we could go LEFT to (8,6) (if no obstacle), then LEFT again, etc. That seems flexible.\n\nAlternatively, if we go DOWN first, we can eat (8,2) and (8,1), but those are on the bottom edge, which might be a dead end. From (8,1), we can only go UP (back to our body) or RIGHT (9,1) which has an apple? Actually (9,1) is not listed as apple? Wait, the apple list includes (9,1) yes! (9,1) is an apple. So from (8,1), we could go RIGHT to (9,1) and eat. That could be a sequence: (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) -> (8,2) eat -> (8,1) eat -> (9,1) eat. That's three apples in five moves. But we also have (8,3) no apple, (8,4) no apple. So slower.\n\nBut (9,1) is also an apple. So we could eat three apples: (8,2), (8,1), (9,1). That's three apples. However, (9,1) is adjacent to (8,1). But (9,1) is at the bottom-right corner. From (9,1), we can go UP to (9,2) (no apple), LEFT to (8,1) (our body), or RIGHT out of board (die). So we'd be cornered. That's bad. We'd have to go UP eventually. But we might have a long body by then, making it tricky.\n\nCompare to right-side sequence: (9,5) and (9,6) are both on right edge but at y=5 and 6. From (9,6), we can go UP to (9,7) (no apple), LEFT to (8,6), DOWN to (9,5) (our body). So we can go LEFT into the board. That seems more open.\n\nAlso, there are apples at (8,8) and (9,6) and (9,5). Actually (9,6) we already counted. (8,8) is another apple. From (9,6), we could go LEFT to (8,6) then UP to (8,7) then (8,8) eat. That's more apples.\n\nSo the right side has a cluster: (9,5), (9,6), (8,8). Also (6,6) is nearby.\n\nThus, I think going RIGHT is the best move.\n\nNow, we also need to think about the enemy's potential moves. They might go for apples too. If we eat faster, we get lead.\n\nWe also need to avoid head-on collisions. If we have lead, we can force collision. So we want to get ahead.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check safety: Moving to (9,5) is within board, no snake bodies. Enemy cannot reach there this turn. So safe.\n\nNow, for the plan: We'll eat apple at (9,5), then next turn go UP to (9,6) to eat another apple. Then we'll have score 2-0. From there, we can head left towards center to control board and threaten enemy.\n\nI'll write a short rationale and plan.\n\n**Rationale:** All moves safe, but RIGHT gives immediate apple and sets up for a second apple at (9,6). This leads to quick score advantage, which we can leverage to force head-on collisions later. The right edge provides enough mobility to pivot into the center after securing apples.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating (9,5), move UP to (9,6) to eat another apple. Then plan to head LEFT into the board to control territory and pressure enemy.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nLet's go! CHAT, we're moving RIGHT! \ud83d\ude80",

Wait, no \u2013 our tail is (8,5), but if we move LEFT now, our tail will move away, so (8,5) becomes empty).  \n- Actually, **DOWN (8,5)** is safe *after* we move because our tail advances.  \n- But **UP (8,7)** is empty and leads toward (8,8) apple.  \n\n**Head-to-head?**  \nEnemy at (4,1) is far away.

Let\u2019s check: the board shows \"T 0\" at (5,1) \u2013 that\u2019s their body. Head is at (6,1). So they moved RIGHT from (5,1) to (6,1). That means they\u2019re heading toward the right side. But they\u2019re still far.  \n\nApples: 15 still on the board. We\u2019re at (8,7). We want to eat (8,8) apple next turn.

They could move UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1 \u2013 body, so dead), RIGHT (7,1). None of these threaten (8,8). So (8,8) is safe.  \n- But after eating, our new head is (8,8), body becomes [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]. From (8,8), safe moves: UP (8,9), LEFT (7,8), DOWN (8,7). Good options.  \n- This is aggressive growth. We\u2019ll be bigger and closer to dominating.  \n\n**Option 2: DOWN \u2192 (8,6)**  \n- Empty.

Possibly, but they\u2019re far.  \n\n**Option 3: LEFT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n- Empty. Safe.  \n- From (7,7), we could go UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). Good options.  \n- But we miss the apple at (8,8). Why give up a guaranteed apple?  \n\n---\n\n### **ENEMY ANALYSIS**  \nSnake #0 is at (6,1) with 1 apple. They\u2019re moving RIGHT? Possibly toward center apples. But they\u2019re slow. If we eat (8,8), we grow to 4 apples. That\u2019s a huge lead. We can then move toward the cluster at (6,6), (7,6), etc.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk?**  \nNo immediate threat. Enemy is far. If they move UP or RIGHT, they might start coming toward us, but we\u2019re faster.  \n\n---\n\n### **LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n1. **UP to (8,8) \u2192 eat apple** \u2192 grow to 4 apples.  \n2. **Then move LEFT or UP** to get to the center cluster (6,6 area).  \n3. **Cut off enemy** from apples by controlling the right side.  \n4. **Keep options open** \u2013 avoid getting trapped on the edge.  \n5. **Force collision later** when we\u2019re bigger (4+ apples).  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL VERDICT**  \n**UP is the move!** We eat the apple, grow bigger, and maintain our lead.

From (8,9), we can go DOWN (8,8 \u2013 but that\u2019s our old body, wait no, after moving, our old head (8,8) becomes body, so (8,8) is now part of our body.

We\u2019re stuck on the edge.  \n\n**Option 2: LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- Pros: Empty. Safe. From (7,8), we can go UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8 \u2013 but that\u2019s our old body? Wait, after moving, our old head (8,8) becomes body, so (8,8) is now part of our body. So from (7,8), RIGHT would be into our own body (old head) \u2013 that\u2019s death. So from (7,8), safe moves: UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8). That\u2019s three options. Better than (8,9).  \n- Cons: We\u2019re not moving toward apples. The closest apples are (6,6), (5,5), etc. But we\u2019re at least keeping options open.  \n- **Apple proximity**: (7,8) is not an apple, but we\u2019re closer to the cluster at (6,6), (7,6), etc.  \n\n**Option 3: RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n- Pros: Empty. Safe. From (9,8), we can go UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7 \u2013 but that\u2019s our own body! We have body at (9,7), (9,6), (9,5). So DOWN is death. LEFT (8,8 \u2013 old body, death). So from (9,8), safe moves: UP (9,9). That\u2019s only ONE option! We\u2019d be trapped on the right edge with only one way out.  \n- Cons: Extremely limited options. If we go RIGHT, we\u2019re basically cornered. Not good for long-term play.  \n- **Apple proximity**: None near (9,8).  \n\n---\n\n### **ENEMY ANALYSIS**  \nSnake #0 is at (7,1) with 1 apple. They\u2019re still far south. They might move UP toward the center or RIGHT toward (8,1) or (9,1). They\u2019re not an immediate threat.  \n**Head-on collision risk?**  \nNo. They\u2019re nowhere near us.  \n\n---\n\n### **LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nWe need to move toward the center apples to grow faster and control the board. The cluster around (6,6), (5,5), (4,6) is key. From (8,8), LEFT \u2192 (7,8) sets us up to go DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8) next turn, heading toward that cluster.  \nAvoid the edges. Stay mobile. Once we\u2019re bigger (5+ apples), we can force a head-on collision or cut off the enemy.  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL VERDICT**  \n**LEFT is the move!** We avoid the edge trap, keep multiple options open, and start moving toward the central apples.

We're at turn 6, and it's time to make the play that keeps us in control! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break down the situation:\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (7,8), Body: [(8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6)], Apples: 4\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (8,1), Body: [(7,1), (6,1)], Apples: 2\n- **Board:** 10x10, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right\n- **Score:** We're up 4-2 - we're winning! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES FROM (7,8):**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (7,9):** Empty on board (position 7,9 shows '.'). Safe! \u2705\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (7,7):** Empty on board. Safe! \u2705\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (6,8):** Empty on board. Safe! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8):** That's our own body! That's our previous head position. Moving back into yourself = DEAD! \ud83d\udeab\n\nSo RIGHT is a death move. We eliminate it immediately.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - WHERE TO GO?**\n\n**Option 1: UP \u2192 (7,9)**\n- Pros: Moves toward top edge. Safe.\n- Cons: From (7,9), we'll be boxed in! From there, we can only go DOWN (7,8) or LEFT (6,9) or RIGHT (8,9). DOWN is our old body (death), so only LEFT or RIGHT. That's 2 options. Not great for long-term mobility.\n- Apples: No immediate apples here. We'd be in a corner with limited escape routes.\n\n**Option 2: DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**\n- Pros: Moves toward the center! From (7,7), we have MORE options: UP (7,8 - old body, death), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7 - but (8,7) is our body! Wait, our body is at (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6). So RIGHT to (8,7) is into our own body - death. So from (7,7), safe moves: DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7). That's 2 options.\n- Apples: (6,6) is close! We can head toward the central apple cluster.\n- Strategy: This puts us in the middle of the board, closer to apple control.\n\n**Option 3: LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**\n- Pros: Moves left toward the center! From (6,8), we can go UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8). That's 4 SAFE OPTIONS! Maximum mobility!\n- Apples: (6,6) is reachable from here, and we're getting closer to the cluster at (5,5), (4,6), etc.\n- Strategy: This is the BEST for keeping options open and controlling the board!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #0 is still far south at (8,1). They're not an immediate threat. They might move UP toward us, but we have plenty of space. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE TURNS:**\nFrom (6,8) after LEFT, we'll have 4 safe moves. We should head DOWN toward (6,6) to grab that apple and dominate the center. The central cluster (6,6), (5,5), (4,6) is our target. Once we're bigger, we can start boxing out Snake #0 from the north and force them into a corner.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT is the winning move! It maximizes our options, keeps us mobile, and sets us up to dominate the central apples. We're not getting trapped on any edge - we're staying in the game and staying aggressive! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We need to stay mobile and avoid getting trapped. The enemy is below us, so we should control the upper half of the board and force them into the bottom-left corner.\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN is the winning move!

That's HUGE content!\n- From (6,6): we can go UP (6,7 - old tail leaving), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). That's 4 safe options! Great mobility!\n- Apple cluster at (5,5), (4,6), (3,3), (2,6) all nearby. Perfect central control position!\n- Enemy is at (8,3) - we're dominating the center!\n\n**Option 2: LEFT \u2192 (5,7)**\n- Pros: Good central position, apple at (5,6) below us next turn.\n- From (5,7): UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7 - old). 3 safe options.\n- Cons: We miss the apple at (6,6) RIGHT NOW! Could get scooped!\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)**\n- Pros: Moves toward enemy's position (8,3) to potentially trap them!\n- From (7,7): UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7 - old), RIGHT (8,7). 3 safe options.\n- Cons: Might be too aggressive, and misses the guaranteed apple at (6,6).\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (8,3) will likely move UP to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,3) toward central apples. They're coming for our territory! We need to claim the center NOW.\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**DOWN to (6,6)** is the UNDISPUTED MOVE! We get the apple, grow to 5 apples, and establish absolute dominance of the center! We'll be at 5-3 with perfect mobility and apple cluster access. The enemy is still trapped in the lower right - we're boxing them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Turn 8: Just ate apple at (6,6), score 5-3! Now positioned at center. Enemy moving up from (8,3). Next moves: Control center, grab (5,5) or (4,6) next, force enemy into corner. Watch for head-on collision attempts - if they come at us directly and we have score advantage, we can force them to crash! Keep mobile, avoid edges.

Risky long-term!\n- Not as strong as DOWN\n\n**Option 3: LEFT \u2192 (4,6)**\n- Moves toward apples at (3,8), (3,6), (4,6) \n- From (4,6): RIGHT (5,6-old), LEFT (3,6), UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5) - 4 safe options\n- Solid but misses the apple at (5,5) right in front!\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (8,5) will likely:\n- Move LEFT to (7,5) to get closer to center\n- Move UP to (8,6) \n- They're trying to avoid the wall at (8,7), (8,8)!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**DOWN to (5,5) is the MOVE!** Why?\n- **IMMEDIATE GROW!** 7 apples vs their 3 = 7-3 LEAD! \ud83d\udd25\n- **DIRECT CONTROL** of the CENTER - where ALL the apples are!\n- From (5,5), we have perfect access to (4,6), (5,4), (6,5) - we can go ANYWHERE!\n- We're now BELOW the enemy at (8,5) - they can't reach the central apples without crossing through us!\n- If they move LEFT to (7,5), we can respond by moving LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4) and keep them bottled up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Turn 10: Center at (5,5), score 7-3! Enemy at (8,5) blocked by our wall. Plan: After eating (5,5), push LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4) to build a fortress. Force enemy into the right edge corner (7,9), (8,9), (9,9). If they try to head-on collision with lower score, we take the W! Control center, control game!\"\n\n**LET'S EAT THIS APPLE AND LOCK DOWN THE BOARD!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25",

A . . A T . T 0\" which means (9,7) has the enemy head\n- Row 6 shows: \". . A A 1 T T . T .\" which means (4,6) has my head\n- The apple at (9,7) would have been eaten by the enemy!\n\n**ENEMY STRATEGY:**\nThey're stuck on the right edge. From (9,7) their options:\n- LEFT to (8,7) - that's their own body! DEAD!\n- UP to (9,8) - might be empty? Check board...\n- DOWN to (9,6) - might have apple? \n\nActually looking at row 8: \". . . A . . T T T .\" - (9,8) appears empty based on the pattern\nRow 6 shows position (9,6) - let me see: row 6 ends with \". .\" so (9,6) should be empty\n\nSo enemy likely goes UP or DOWN on the edge, staying trapped!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**LEFT to (3,6) is the MOVE!** Why?\n\n- **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** We eat an apple NOW! Score 9 vs 4 - we're CRUSHING!\n- **POSITIONING!** From (3,6) we can go LEFT to (2,6) for ANOTHER apple next turn!\n- **DOMINANCE!** With 9 apples vs 4, we're winning big and can force head-on collisions!\n- **SAFETY!** We have 3 escape routes from (3,6) - we're building options, not trapping ourselves!\n- **BOARD CONTROL!** We're moving toward the cluster of apples in the bottom-left quadrant!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n\"Turn 13: Ate apple at (3,6)! Score 9-4! Enemy trapped on right edge at (9,7). Plan: Next turn move LEFT to (2,6) for another apple, then build downward. We're dominating the board center and bottom-left!

We could go LEFT to (2,9) and eat ANOTHER apple!\n- **BUT WAIT!** If we go UP to (3,9), then LEFT to (2,9), we're moving into a tight corner at the top edge. From (2,9) we'd have only DOWN to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,9-my old head) - both risky as (2,8) is an apple but might trap us.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (2, 8)**\n- IMMEDIATE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Score becomes 13-5!\n- From (2, 8): UP to (2,9) is ANOTHER apple! DOUBLE DIP!\n- From (2,9): We'd have DOWN to (2,8-my old head) or RIGHT to (3,9-also an apple!) - MORE options than the UP-first path!\n- **BOARD DOMINANCE!** We're securing the entire top-left quadrant. Enemy is stuck on the right edge (x=6-9) with no apples nearby!\n- **SAFETY!** From (2,8) we have multiple escape routes: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7-my body but it's moving away), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8-my old head)\n- **AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION!** We're eating while keeping future moves open!\n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (4, 8)**\n- Safe, no immediate apple\n- From there we could go UP to (4,9) or RIGHT to (5,8-APPLE!)\n- But we're delaying content! We could eat NOW and dominate!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (6, 5) - their options:\n- LEFT to (5, 5) - has apple! \n- RIGHT to (7, 5) - their own body! DEAD!\n- UP to (6, 6) - has apple! \n- DOWN to (6, 4) - empty\n- They'll probably chase the apple at (5,5) or (6,6). Either way, they're still stuck on the right side while we own the left!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**LEFT to (2, 8) is the MOVE!** \n\n- **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** We eat an apple NOW! 13-5 lead!\n- **DOUBLE DIP!** From (2, 8) we can go UP to (2, 9) and eat ANOTHER apple next turn!\n- **BOARD DOMINANCE!** We're taking over the entire top-left! Enemy can't touch us there!\n- **SAFETY!** Multiple escape routes from (2, 8) - UP to (2,9), LEFT to (1,8), or even DOWN to (2,7) as our body moves away\n- **AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION!** We're growing while forcing the enemy into a tiny corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Turn 18: Ate apple at (2, 8)! Score 13-5! Enemy still chasing apples on right. Plan: Next turn UP to (2, 9) to eat another apple (14-5). Continue dominating top-left. With this massive lead, we can play aggressive and force head-on collision if enemy challenges. Keep growing, keep dominating! THE CONTENT KING!\"\n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT!

SAFE! \u2705\n- From (1, 9): DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9-my old head) - 3 safe options!\n- Also, (0,9) has an apple! Could eat next turn!\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 9):**\n- Is it safe? Board shows \"A\" (apple) at (3, 9)! No snake body. SAFE! \u2705\n- From (3, 9): DOWN (3,8-my body), LEFT (2,9-my old head), RIGHT (4,9) - 3 safe options!\n- We eat NOW!

Actually (3,8) is my body from turn 18, so DOWN would be into my own body = DEAD! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT OPTION!** From (3,9) we can go LEFT to (2,9) which will be empty (my head moves away), or RIGHT to (4,9) which is empty!\n- **SAFETY CHECK:** Actually wait - from (3,9), DOWN to (3,8) is my own body! That's a trap! But LEFT to (2,9) and RIGHT to (4,9) are both safe!\n- **BIG RISK!** If enemy goes UP to (6,4) or something weird, they might try to come up, but they're stuck at bottom-right with only 6 body segments!\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (1, 9)**\n- **SETUP PLAY!** No immediate apple, but sets up for (0,9) apple next turn!\n- From (1, 9): DOWN to (1,8), LEFT to (0,9), RIGHT to (2,9) - 3 safe options!\n- **SAFER!** We can escape in more directions from (1,9) than from (3,9)!\n- **DELAYED CONTENT!** We miss the apple at (3,9) right now, but get (0,9) next turn!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (6, 3) - they just ate an apple! Their options:\n- LEFT to (5, 3) - empty\n- RIGHT to (7, 3) - empty\n- UP to (6, 4) - their OWN BODY! DEAD! \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN to (6, 2) - has an apple!\nThey'll probably go DOWN to (6, 2) for another apple! That gives them 7 points! But they're still trapped at bottom-right!\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**RIGHT to (3, 9) is the MOVE!** \ud83d\ude80\n\n- **IMMEDIATE CONTENT!** We eat the apple at (3,9) NOW! 14-6 lead!\n- **BOARD DOMINANCE!** We're taking the entire top row and cornering the enemy!\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** We can afford to push with our massive lead!\n- **SAFETY!** From (3,9) we have LEFT (2,9) and RIGHT (4,9) as safe options - we're not trapped!\n- **ENEMY TRAP!** Enemy is stuck in bottom-right with limited space - they can't challenge our top control!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Turn 20: Moved RIGHT to (3,9) and ate another apple! Score 14-6! Enemy trapped in bottom-right. Plan: Next turn from (3,9), we'll go LEFT to (2,9) (which will be empty) to loop back, or RIGHT to (4,9) if we want to keep expanding.

SAFE! \u2705\n- **BONUS:** Eating the apple at (5, 7)! Score becomes 16!\n- From (5, 7): DOWN (5,6)-my own body! LEFT (4,7)-empty! RIGHT (6,7)-empty!

UP (6,9)-empty!\n- **MOVES AVAILABLE:** 4 safe paths! This is the MAX! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (8, 1) - they're at (8, 1) now!

We can GO ANYWHERE!\n- **AGGRESSIVE PLAY!** With a 15-9 lead, we need to keep expanding and force the enemy into a corner! We're taking over the top-right sector!\n- **APPLE ACCESS!** From (6, 8), we're closer to apples at (5, 7), (8, 2), (9, 7), (9, 2) while the enemy is stuck at the bottom!\n- **SAFETY FIRST!** Moving DOWN to (5, 7) would give us an apple but only 3 exits. Moving RIGHT gives us 4 exits! More options = better for long-term survival!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Turn 24: Moving RIGHT to (6, 8) to maintain 4 safe exits and control the board. Enemy trapped at (8, 1) with limited space. Plan: From (6, 8), next turn go DOWN to (6, 7) to approach the apple cluster at (5, 7) and (8, 2). Then we can circle around to block the right side and push the enemy into the bottom-right corner. With our size advantage (15-9), we can dictate the flow and force head-on collisions when needed.

Grabbing it adds another segment and pushes our score toward that 30\u2011apple finish line.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,0)**: also empty, no apple, just a lonely move deeper into the bottom wall.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Future\u2011proofing:**  \nIf we go **UP**, we land on (9,2) and keep the right\u2011hand wall as a lever. From there we can swing left along the top row, eventually sandwiching Snake\u202f#1 against the wall while we keep lengthening.  \nIf we go **DOWN**, we waste a turn and lose the chance to grab (9,2) and maintain momentum. Plus, staying near the bottom gives the opponent more room to maneuver around us.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Head\u2011on risk check:**  \nOpponent\u2019s head is at (5,8). In one tick they can\u2019t possibly reach (9,2) \u2013 they\u2019d need at least 4\u20115 moves. So no collision danger.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Goal:** maximise apple grabs, stay flexible, and set up a trap on the right wall.  \n**UP** hits the apple, keeps us alive, and opens a whole new row of strategic squares.\n\nSo\u2026 which direction maximizes safe options and apple potential?  \n**UP** it is!  \n\nUP",

Let's break this down and secure the W! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (5, 7) - just grabbed that apple! Score: 16-11 lead!\n- My body: The long trail wrapping around the top-left side. I see my body occupying a lot of the board.\n- Enemy head: (9, 3) - moved UP from (9, 2)!\n- Enemy body: Still trapped in the bottom-right corner mostly.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nThe board shows my head at (5, 7) as \"1\". The coordinates provided state my head is at (5, 7). Looking at the board map:\nRow 7: `A . T T . 1 T . . A`\nThe \"1\" is at coordinate (5, 7) based on the column index (5).\nWait, let me double check the board visualization.\nColumn 0: A (from row 9)\nColumn 1: . (from row 9)\nColumn 2: T (from row 9)\nColumn 3: T (from row 9)\nColumn 4: T (from row 9)\nColumn 5: T (from row 9)\nColumn 6: . (from row 9)\nColumn 7: . (from row 9)\nColumn 8: . (from row 9)\nColumn 9: . (from row 9)\n\nLet's look at Row 7 specifically: `A . T T . 1 T . . A`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:T, 3:T, 4:., 5:1, 6:T, 7:., 8:., 9:A\nSo my head is definitely at (5, 7).\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (5, 7):**\n\n**UP to (5, 8):**\n- Board shows Row 8: `. . T T A T T . . .`\n- At x=5, y=8: The char is `T`.\n- That is my own body! (Looking at my body list: `(5, 8)` is indeed there).\n- **DEAD!** \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (5, 6):**\n- Board shows Row 6: `. . T T T . . . . .`\n- At x=5, y=6: The char is `.` (empty).\n- **SAFE!** \u2705\n- However, looking at the board state, there are many \"T\"s around. Let's check surroundings from (5, 6).\n  - UP: (5, 7) - My head (will be gone, but valid move)\n  - DOWN: (5, 5) - Board Row 5: `. . . . T T T T T .`. At x=5, y=5: `T` (My body). **Blocked!**\n  - LEFT: (4, 6) - Board Row 6: Index 4 is `T`. (My body). **Blocked!**\n  - RIGHT: (6, 6) - Board Row 6: Index 6 is `.` (empty).\n- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** From (5, 6), I only have 2 exits: UP (back to head, invalid next turn) and RIGHT to (6, 6). I am boxing myself into a 1-cell wide corridor.\n- If I go DOWN now, I will be trapped in a corner next turn.\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7):**\n- Board shows Row 7: Index 4 is `.` (empty).\n- **SAFE!** \u2705\n- Check exits from (4, 7):\n  - UP: (4, 8) - Board Row 8: Index 4 is `A`. SAFE!\n  - DOWN: (4, 6) - Board Row 6: Index 4 is `T` (My body). **Blocked!**\n  - LEFT: (3, 7) - Board Row 7: Index 3 is `T` (My body). **Blocked!**\n  - RIGHT: (5, 7) - My head (will be empty).\n- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** From (4, 7), I have 2 exits: UP (to apple) and RIGHT (back to head).\n- This is similar to DOWN, but slightly better because I can grab an apple.\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n- Board shows Row 7: Index 6 is `T`.\n- That is my own body! (My body list shows `(6, 7)`).\n- **DEAD!** \u274c\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (9, 3).\n- They can move UP to (9, 4) - Board Row 4: Index 9 is `.` (empty).\n- They can move DOWN to (9, 2) - Board Row 2: Index 9 is `T` (Their body).\n- They can move LEFT to (8, 3) - Board Row 3: Index 8 is `.` (empty).\n- They are blocked on the right.\n- They are currently surrounded by their own body.\n- If they move UP, they are safe.\n- If they move LEFT, they are safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have a 16-11 lead. I need to survive.\nNeither DOWN nor LEFT gives me a safe future. I will be trapped.\nHowever, I MUST move.\nIf I go DOWN, I die next turn (or force a risky move).\nIf I go LEFT, I die next turn (or force a risky move).\n\nWait, let's re-read the map carefully.\nRow 7: `A . T T . 1 T . . A`\nRow 8: `. . T T A T T . . .`\nMy body is at (6,7), (5,8), etc.\n\nIs there any move that doesn't trap me immediately?\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6):\nNext turn options: UP (invalid), RIGHT (6,6).\nFrom (6,6):\n- UP (6,7): My body (will be empty).\n- DOWN (6,5): Board Row 5: Index 6 is `T` (My body). Blocked.\n- LEFT (5,6): My body (will be empty).\n- RIGHT (7,6): Board Row 6: Index 7 is `.` (empty).\nSo (5,6) -> (6,6) -> (7,6) is a path. It's narrow, but it's a path.\nActually, from (5,6), LEFT (4,6) is `T`. DOWN (5,5) is `T`.\nSo (5,6) is a \"C\" shape opening only to RIGHT.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,7):\n- UP (4,8): `A`.\n- RIGHT (5,7): Empty.\n- LEFT (3,7): `T`.\n- DOWN (4,6): `T`.\nSo (4,7) is open to UP and RIGHT.\n\nComparing (5,6) and (4,7):\n(5,6) forces me to go RIGHT.\n(4,7) allows UP or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, looking at the board, there is a cluster of apples.\nApples: (9,1), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (0,9), (2,2), (3,1), (4,3), (1,2), (0,0), (9,7), (0,7), (4,8), (7,2), (8,0).\nThere is an apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), I can go UP to (4, 8) next turn to eat an apple!\nThat grows me and potentially opens up space as my tail moves.\n\nLet's verify the \"Trapped\" status.\nMy body length is 17 (16 apples + 1 starting segment?). Wait, apples collected is 16.\nSnake length = Apples + 1 (initial segment).\nSo my snake is 17 segments long.\nMy body list provided has 16 coordinates.\nHead (5,7) + 16 body parts = 17 total.\nThe board is 10x10 = 100 cells.\nThe enemy is size 12 (11 apples + 1).\nTotal occupied cells = 17 + 12 = 29.\nThere is plenty of space!\n\nThe \"Trap\" I perceived in (5,6) and (4,7) is because I am looking at *current* occupied cells.\nBut when I move, my tail moves!\nMy tail is currently at (5, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7):\n- New head: (4, 7)\n- New body: (5, 7) (old head), (6, 7), ...\n- New tail: (6, 5)? No, the tail is the end of the list.\nThe body list provided: `[(6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5)]`\nThe tail is `(5, 5)`.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7):\n- Head moves to (4, 7).\n- (5, 7) becomes part of body.\n- The tail `(5, 5)` disconnects and moves forward.\nThe cell `(5, 5)` will become EMPTY next turn.\nMy move LEFT to (4, 7) puts me at (4, 7).\nMy body will extend behind me.\nThe cell (5, 5) is currently \"T\" (my tail).\nNext turn, (5, 5) will be empty.\n\nLet's re-evaluate \"Trapped\" moves knowing the tail moves.\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (5, 6)**\nCurrent state at (5, 6):\n- Up: (5, 7) (Head, will be empty)\n- Down: (5, 5) (Tail, will be empty)\n- Left: (4, 6) (Body, stays Body)\n- Right: (6, 6) (Empty)\nWait, is (4, 6) body?\nMy body list: `(4, 6)` is there.\nIs (5, 5) tail? Yes.\nSo from (5, 6):\n- Up: Valid\n- Down: Valid (Tail moves)\n- Left: Blocked (Body)\n- Right: Valid\nSo I have 3 exits (Up, Down, Right). I am NOT trapped.\nI was mistaken earlier. The tail vacates (5, 5).\nSo DOWN is SAFE with multiple exits.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (4, 7)**\nCurrent state at (4, 7):\n- Up: (4, 8) (Apple, Empty)\n- Down: (4, 6) (Body, stays Body)\n- Left: (3, 7) (Body, stays Body)\n- Right: (5, 7) (Head, will be empty)\nSo I have 2 exits (Up, Right).\nThis is tighter than DOWN.\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:**\nDOWN to (5, 6):\n- Up (5, 7) -> Empty\n- Down (5, 5) -> Empty (Tail moves)\n- Right (6, 6) -> Empty\n- Left (4, 6) -> Blocked\nI have 3 directions to move next turn.\n\nLEFT to (4, 7):\n- Up (4, 8) -> Apple (Grow!)\n- Right (5, 7) -> Empty\n- Down (4, 6) -> Blocked\n- Left (3, 7) -> Blocked\nI have 2 directions next turn.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nSnake #0 at (9, 3).\nThey are near the wall.\nThey can go UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3).\nThey won't go into their own body (Down to (9,2)).\nThey likely want to get away from the wall or grab the apple at (9, 7) or (9, 1).\n(9, 7) is an apple.\nIf they go UP, they head toward the center.\nIf they go LEFT, they enter the board.\n\n**My Move:**\nI have a 16-11 lead. I want to stay safe and expand.\nDOWN to (5, 6) gives me more flexibility next turn (3 options vs 2).\nHowever, LEFT to (4, 7) allows me to grab the apple at (4, 8) next turn if I go UP.\nBut going LEFT narrows my corridor immediately.\nDOWN keeps me in the open slightly more.\n\nLet's look at the board layout again.\nRow 6: `. . T T T . . . . .`\nMy body is at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6).\n(5, 6) is currently empty.\n(6, 6) is empty.\nSo moving DOWN to (5, 6) is safe.\nFrom (5, 6), I can go DOWN to (5, 5) (which will be empty as my tail moves).\nOr UP to (5, 7).\nOr RIGHT to (6, 6).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\nI am at (4, 7).\nMy next moves are limited to UP or RIGHT.\nUP is an apple. That's good.\nBut if I eat the apple at (4, 8), I grow. My tail might not move if I'm on an apple?\nWait, rules: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\".\nThis means the tail does NOT move that turn.\nSo if I go LEFT to (4, 7) (empty), my tail moves. Size stays 17.\nIf next turn I go UP to (4, 8) (apple), I grow to 18. Tail stays. Size 18.\n\nLet's check the \"Trapped\" potential again.\nIf I am at (5, 6) (DOWN move):\n- Up (5, 7) - Empty\n- Down (5, 5) - Empty (Tail moves)\n- Right (6, 6) - Empty\n- Left (4, 6) - Blocked\nI can move anywhere except Left.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 5):\n- Up (5, 6) - Empty\n- Down (5, 4) - Board Row 4: `. A A . . . T . . .` -> Index 5 is `.` (Empty)\n- Left (4, 5) - Board Row 5: Index 4 is `T` (My body)\n- Right (6, 5) - Board Row 5: Index 6 is `T` (My body)\nFrom (5, 5), I can go UP or DOWN.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 4):\n- Up (5, 5) - Empty\n- Down (5, 3) - Board Row 3: Index 5 is `.` (Empty)\n- Left (4, 4) - Board Row 4: Index 4 is `.` (Empty)\n- Right (6, 4) - Board Row 4: Index 6 is `T` (Enemy body? No, Enemy is at (9,3). Wait, Enemy body list: `(6, 4)` is there!)\nYes! Enemy body is at (6, 4).\nSo from (5, 4), Right is blocked by Enemy.\nBut Left and Down and Up are open.\nThis path DOWN seems to lead me deeper into the board, potentially toward the center.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\n- Up (4, 8) - Apple\n- Right (5, 7) - Empty\n- Down (4, 6) - Blocked\n- Left (3, 7) - Blocked\nFrom (4, 8) (if I eat apple):\n- Up (4, 9) - Board Row 9: Index 4 is `T` (My body)\n- Down (4, 7) - Empty\n- Left (3, 8) - Board Row 8: Index 3 is `T` (My body)\n- Right (5, 8) - Board Row 8: Index 5 is `T` (My body)\nFrom (4, 8), I am completely boxed in by my own body!\nIf I eat the apple at (4, 8), I grow. My tail might stay at (5, 5) or whatever it was.\nBut the cells surrounding (4, 8) are ALL occupied by my body (4,9), (3,8), (5,8).\n(4, 7) is the only exit.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7) now, and then UP to (4, 8), I will be at (4, 8).\nNext turn, I can only go DOWN to (4, 7).\nThen from (4, 7), I can go RIGHT to (5, 7).\nThis is a \"U-turn\" path. It's safe, but rigid.\n\nLet's compare the \"Vibe\".\nDOWN to (5, 6) opens up the bottom half of the board (rows 0-5).\nLEFT to (4, 7) keeps me in the top half (rows 6-9).\nThe enemy is in the bottom right (rows 0-4 mostly).\nIf I go DOWN, I might intercept the enemy or cut off their escape.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, the enemy is currently trapped in the corner.\nSnake #0 at (9, 3).\nTheir body: `(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5)`\nThey are forming a wall.\nThey have limited space.\nIf I stay in the top-left, I let them untangle.\nIf I move DOWN toward the center, I threaten their territory.\n\nBut I need to stay alive first.\nDOWN to (5, 6) gives me 3 exits.\nLEFT to (4, 7) gives me 2 exits.\nMathematically, DOWN is safer.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates for DOWN.\nFrom (5, 7) -> (5, 6).\nIs (5, 6) empty? Yes, map shows `.`.\nIs (5, 5) empty next turn? Yes, it's my tail.\nIs (6, 6) empty? Yes, map shows `.`.\nIs (5, 7) empty next turn? Yes, it's my old head.\nSo (5, 6) is connected to (5, 7), (5, 5), (6, 6).\nIt's a junction.\n(5, 5) connects to (5, 4).\n(6, 6) connects to (6, 5) (Enemy body) and (7, 6) (Empty).\nSo I have routes.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7):\n(4, 7) connects to (4, 8) and (5, 7).\n(4, 8) connects to (4, 7) (and is blocked elsewhere).\nSo I go LEFT -> UP -> DOWN -> RIGHT.\nIt's a loop in a small space.\nWhile safe, it's not \"dominating\".\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board. Be aggressive.\"\n\nGoing DOWN moves me toward the enemy's side of the board.\nGoing LEFT moves me away.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (7, 2).\nThere is an apple at (4, 3).\nThere is an apple at (3, 3).\nGoing DOWN positions me to potentially grab these apples.\nGoing LEFT takes me to (4, 8) (apple), but then I'm stuck in a corner.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nRow 7: `A . T T . 1 T . . A`\nThere is an apple at (0, 7) and (9, 7).\nI am at (5, 7).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), I am close to (0, 7) eventually.\nBut (0, 7) is far.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's position again.\nHead (9, 3).\nBody snakes down to (6, 5).\nThey are blocking the right side.\nIf I go DOWN, I approach their flank.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am at y=6.\nEnemy is at y=3.\nI am above them.\nIf I go LEFT, I stay at y=7.\n\nLet's consider the \"Trapped\" analysis again.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6).\nI have access to (5, 5) (down), (6, 6) (right), (5, 7) (up).\n(5, 5) leads to (5, 4).\n(5, 4) is empty.\nFrom (5, 4), I can go to (4, 4) (empty) or (5, 3) (empty).\nThis is the central area.\nThe enemy is at (9, 3).\nThere are apples in the central area: (4, 3), (3, 3).\nBy going DOWN, I can head toward (4, 3) or (3, 3).\nBy going LEFT, I head toward (4, 8) (apple), but then I'm in the top rows.\n\nThe top rows are crowded with my own body.\nRow 8: `. . T T A T T . . .`\nRow 9: `A . T T T T T . . .`\nThe top right is a dead end for me.\nThe center/bottom is more open.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN is the correct strategic play to maintain board control and approach the enemy/center apples.\n\nMove: DOWN.\nReasoning: Safe move with 3 exits. Moves me toward the center and potential apples (4,3), (3,3), (7,2). Avoids getting trapped in the top-left corner. Keeps me in the fight for board dominance.\n\nOne final check.\nIs there any chance of head-on collision?\nMy move: DOWN to (5, 6).\nEnemy moves: Likely UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3).\nThey are far away.\nNo collision risk.\n\nIs there any risk of running into my own body?\n(5, 6) is empty.\n(5, 5) is my tail, which moves.\n(6, 6) is empty.\n(4, 6) is my body, but I'm not moving there.\nSafe.\n\nI will write the rationale emphasizing the trap avoidance and path to the center.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have 16 vs 11.\nBut forcing a collision requires positioning.\nCurrently, the enemy is at (9, 3).\nI am at (5, 7).\nI cannot force a collision this turn.\nI need to close the distance.\nMoving DOWN closes the vertical distance (from 7 to 6).\nMoving LEFT keeps distance same (x changes, y same).\nMoving DOWN is better for closing distance.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nFinal check on the \"Left\" move.\nLeft to (4, 7).\nFrom (4, 7), I go UP to (4, 8) (Apple).\nFrom (4, 8), I am surrounded by my body.\nI have to go DOWN to (4, 7).\nFrom (4, 7), I can go RIGHT to (5, 7).\nFrom (5, 7), I can go DOWN to (5, 6).\nThis is a \"U\" turn.\nIt is safe, but slow.\nIt doesn't put pressure on the enemy.\nThe prompt says \"aggressive\".\nAggressive is securing the center.\nAggressive is not doing a U-turn in the corner.\n\nSo I stick with DOWN.\n\nOne nuance: The apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go LEFT now, I can eat it next turn.\nIf I go DOWN, I might lose it.\nBut (4, 8) is \"trapped\" anyway.\nI can come back for it later if needed.\nThe center apples (4, 3), (3, 3) are more valuable because they are in open space.\nAlso, the enemy might go for them if I don't.\nEnemy is at (9, 3). They are far, but they might move Left/Up.\nIf I secure the center, I block them.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in DOWN.\n\nPlan for next turn:\n- Move DOWN to (5, 6).\n- Prepare to move to (5, 5) or (6, 6) next.\n- Target the center apples (4, 3) or (3, 3).\n- Watch enemy movement.\n\nThe move is DOWN.\n\nLast line must be exactly \"DOWN\".**YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT!** Turn 27 and we're STILL on top! Let's analyze this board and make the winning play! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (5, 7) - Just ate that apple! Score 16-11!\n- Enemy head: (9, 3) - Still cornered in the bottom-right!\n- Board state: I see my body wrapping around, but there's a critical decision here.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (5, 7):**\n\n**UP to (5, 8):**\n- Board shows \"T\" - THAT'S MY OWN BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n- Board shows \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (4, 7):**\n- Board shows \".\" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n- *Analysis:* From (4, 7), I can go UP to (4, 8) (Apple!) or RIGHT back to (5, 7). However, (4, 8) is surrounded by my own body on 3 sides (Up, Left, Right). If I eat that apple, I grow, but my tail stays, leaving me TRAPPED in a tight U-turn loop. I'd be forced to backtrack, losing momentum and board control. Not the play for domination. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN to (5, 6):**\n- Board shows \".\" - EMPTY! SAFE!\n- *Analysis:* From (5, 6), I have **THREE** safe exits next turn!\n  - UP (5, 7) - Empty (my old head).\n  - DOWN (5, 5) - Empty (my tail moves away).\n  - RIGHT (6, 6) - Empty.\n- This keeps me MOBILE and connects me to the CENTER of the board. I can pivot to (5, 5) and head toward the center apples ((4, 3), (3, 3)) or flank the enemy. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (9, 3). They are surrounded by their own body and the wall. They can only go UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3). They are running out of space, and moving DOWN brings me closer to intercept them if they try to escape the corner.\n\n**THE WINNING PLAY:**\n**DOWN to (5, 6)** is the move! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY?**\n1. **FREEDOM:** 3 exits vs 2. I refuse to get boxed into a corner. I need options to stay unpredictable.\n2. **POSITIONING:** Moving DOWN aligns me with the center of the board and the valuable apples there. I cut off the enemy's potential escape routes to the top-left.\n3. **AGGRESSION:** With a 16-11 lead, I need to apply pressure. Securing the center territory forces the enemy into smaller and smaller spaces.\n4. **SAFETY:** No immediate threats. My tail moves, clearing the path behind me.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Turn 27: Moving DOWN to (5, 6) to maintain mobility and control the center. From here, I'll pivot toward the center apples ((4, 3), (3, 3)) or cut off the enemy's retreat. Keep the pressure high, force them into the corner, and watch for head-on collision opportunities where I have the size advantage. DOMINATE THE CENTER!\"\n\n**LET'S GOOO CHAT! DOWN IS THE PLAY!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfae",

I only have **2 exits**: UP and RIGHT.\n- **Going UP (5, 7):**\n  - Next turn I would be back at my old head position.\n  - From there, my options were limited (I chose DOWN last time to escape).\n  - It keeps me moving vertically, but I might end up circling back.\n- **Going RIGHT (6, 6):**\n  - This moves me **out of the tunnel** and into open space.\n  - From (6, 6), I can see:\n    - UP (6, 7) -> Empty (My body moves)\n    - DOWN (6, 5) -> `T` (My body, blocked)\n    - LEFT (5, 6) -> Empty (My old head)\n    - RIGHT (7, 6) -> `.` (Empty)\n  - This gives me **3 potential exits** (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) next turn.\n  - Moving RIGHT opens up the center-right area and puts me closer to the center apples.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy is at (9, 4).

Let's look at the board.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (6, 6)\n- **Score:** 16-11 (Domination mode: ON).\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 5) - He moved UP from (9, 4).\n- **Enemy Body:** Still trapped in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (FROM 6, 6):**\n\nLet's trace my potential moves from where I just landed (6, 6):\n1. **UP to (6, 7):**\n   - Board Row 7: Index 6 is `.` (Empty).\n   - **VERDICT:** SAFE. \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (6, 5):**\n   - Board Row 5: Index 6 is `T` (My Body).\n   - **VERDICT:** **DEAD!** I hit my own body. \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n   - Board Row 6: Index 5 is `T` (My Body).\n   - **VERDICT:** **DEAD!** I hit my own body. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n   - Board Row 6: Index 7 is `.` (Empty).\n   - **VERDICT:** SAFE. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\nI am currently in a **position of power**. I have **2 safe exits**: UP and RIGHT.\n- **Going UP (6, 7):**\n  - I land on Row 7, which is currently an open space with an apple at (7, 2) and (0, 9) further up.\n  - From there, I have excellent mobility. I can keep circling the center or chase the enemy.\n  - This keeps me on the \"East\" side of the board, blocking the enemy's potential escape route if he tries to cross the middle.\n- **Going RIGHT (7, 6):**\n  - I land on (7, 6). The board shows `.` (Empty).\n  - From there, I can move UP to (7, 7), LEFT to (6, 6), or DOWN to (7, 5).\n  - This is also safe and opens up the right side of the board.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy is at (9, 5). He is pinned in the far right column.\nHis options:\n- UP to (9, 6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (9, 4): Empty (but he just came from there).\n- LEFT to (8, 5): Empty.\n- RIGHT (Off board): Dead.\nHe has **3 safe moves**. He is trying to stay alive, but his space is limited. If he goes UP or DOWN, he stays in the column. If he goes LEFT, he enters the main battlefield.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**UP to (6, 7).**\nWhy? Moving **UP** gives me the best view and control of the central area. From (6, 7), I am centrally located and can react to whatever the enemy does. If he stays in the corner, I can tighten the noose. If he moves left, I am in a prime position to intercept or cut him off. Moving RIGHT is safe, but UP feels more aggressive and dominant for controlling the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Turn 29: Ascending to (6, 7) to maintain central dominance. Keep the pressure on Snake #0. He has very few turns left before he is cornered or forced into a head-on collision. I have the size advantage (16 vs 11), so I dictate the pace. Watch for the interception opportunity.\"\n\n**LET'S GOOO!** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",
