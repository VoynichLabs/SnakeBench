Safety Check of Moves**\n- **UP ⇒ (9, 3):**  \n    - Within bounds, no body, no enemy—safe.\n- **DOWN ⇒ (9, 1):**  \n    - Occupied by my tail (but since I just moved and I'm not eating this turn, my tail will vacate, so technically this is possible, but going down moves me away from apples and is sub-optimal).\n- **LEFT ⇒ (8, 2):**  \n    - Open, no tail, no enemy, within bounds—also safe.\n- **RIGHT ⇒ (10, 2):**  \n    - Out of bounds—lethal.\n\n### **3.

Enemy Snake Position**\n- Enemy snake is at (8, 6), which is left and up from me, but between me and the apple at (8, 7).  \n- No current collision risk.\n\n### **5. Optimal Move**\n- Since (9, 5) is due north, and no other snakes or obstacles block that route, the most direct and quickest way to earn a point is to head UP towards (9, 5).\n- This also keeps me at the board edge, minimizing flanking risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy for next turn:**\n- Continue moving UP until I approach (9, 5).\n- After eating that apple, reassess which apple is closer (potentially (8, 7) or (3, 2)), and check for possible enemy interference as I move toward the center or left of the board.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \n**UP**",

They're moving upward and are relatively close to the apple at (9, 5) - they would need 0 horizontal moves and 2 up = 2 moves total.\n\nSince the enemy snake can reach (9, 5) in 2 moves and I need 3 moves, they'll likely get there first if we both head for it. However, I should still consider my options:\n\nSafety check for each direction:\n- UP to (8, 8): Safe, no collisions\n- DOWN to (8, 6): DEATH - this is where my body segment is!\n- LEFT to (7, 7): Safe, no collisions  \n- RIGHT to (9, 7): Safe, no collisions\n\nGiven that the enemy snake will likely get the (9, 5) apple, I should position myself strategically for the remaining apples. Moving RIGHT to (9, 7) would put me closer to contest the (9, 5) apple area, but the enemy will probably get there first.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8) would position me better for the other apples. The apple at (4, 5) might be a good medium-term target, and moving LEFT starts me in that direction.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the (9, 5) apple. The enemy snake is at (9, 3) and needs to move UP twice to get to (9, 5). If I move RIGHT to (9, 7), I'd be at (9, 7) and need 2 moves down to get to (9, 5). We'd both be 2 moves away! But they have the advantage of being on the same vertical line.\n\nI think my best strategy is to move LEFT toward the other apples and let the enemy take (9, 5), then focus on collecting the remaining apples more efficiently.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving toward the cluster of apples on the left side of the board, particularly targeting (4, 5) or (2, 5) depending on enemy movement.\n\nLEFT",

Not valid.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Which is optimal?**\n\nOur main objective is apple collection and survival:\n\n- The only apple directly accessible with a clear route is at (9, 5), just two spaces up.\n- No enemies, snake bodies, or tails between me and the apple, as the enemy is on the left side and one row above.\n- No urgent danger—keep moving UP.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Aftermath—What Next?**\n\n- **After moving up**, if I get closer to (9, 5), prepare to grab the apple next turn.\n- Enemy snake’s head will be at (8, 7) and can only race to (8, 7) or possibly (4, 5) before me; these are far enough not to pose a short-term threat.\n\n- I'll reassess after eating the apple, because the spawn of new apples or enemy movements can change priorities.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Strategy Reminder for Next Turn**\n- Once I reach (9, 5), consider the next closest apple (maybe (8, 7), but depends on enemy; otherwise, (4, 5) or (3, 2)).\n- Always monitor enemy snake position, as we’re beginning to converge toward the cluster of apples in the 3–5 y-band.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Move:**\n**UP**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nGo to (9, 5), eat the apple, then prioritize safety and fastest access to the next apple(s), staying alert for enemy approach toward the apple cluster.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \n**UP**",

Tight loop; not allowed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Which Move is Better?**\n\nLet’s look at the apples:\n\n- (9, 5) is one square up and right. From (8, 4), that's RIGHT-UP diagonally; can get UP to (8, 5), then RIGHT to (9, 5).  \n- (4, 5) is 4 steps LEFT and 1 step UP.\n- (2, 5) is further in the same direction.\n- (3, 8) is distant, upper left.\n- (3, 2) is also left and down.\n\nClosest are the apples at (9, 5) and (4, 5), both on row y=5.\n\n**From my current position:**\n\n- Going UP (to 8, 5) puts me in line for (9, 5) (next-move accessible).\n- Going LEFT doesn't advance toward any apple immediately, but could angle me toward apples at (4, 5), (2, 5).\n- Going DOWN is not good; no apples below, and backs toward board edge eventually.\n\nNow, check if going UP is safe:\n- (8, 5): empty\n- Enemy is at (6, 7), not nearby\n- My own body at (9, 4) is to the RIGHT; LEFT is also free\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Best Option**\n\n- If I go UP, then next turn I can go RIGHT to (9, 5) to eat an apple!\n- It's also possible to go LEFT, but it's a longer route to apples, and I might lose out to another snake.\n- There's no current crowding at the top. \n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- After going UP, if safe, go RIGHT to (9, 5) to eat the apple.\n- Then, with added length, prioritize staying toward apples at (4, 5) and avoid boxing myself in at the edge.\n- Watch closely if enemy snake approaches central apples.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED MOVE: UP**\n\n**(Move to (8, 5))**\n\n---\n\n**Next-turn focus:**  \nIf all safe, go RIGHT to (9, 5) and eat the apple.

They moved UP from (8, 4) to (8, 5), getting very close to the apple at (9, 5)!

Since the enemy is likely going for (9, 5) next turn, I should focus on securing (4, 5) quickly.\n\nTo get to (4, 5) from (6, 6), I need to go 2 left and 1 down. I can either:\n1. Go LEFT twice then DOWN once, or\n2. Go DOWN once then LEFT twice\n\nGoing DOWN first to (6, 5) puts me on the same row as the apple at (4, 5), then I just need to go LEFT twice. This seems like the most direct path.\n\nHowever, let me also consider going LEFT first to (5, 6). From there I'd be 1 left and 1 down from the apple. Both paths work, but going DOWN first gets me to the target row immediately.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (6, 5), I'll be perfectly aligned horizontally with the apple at (4, 5) and can move LEFT twice to claim it.

          "rationale": "Let's reason step-by-step to choose the best move from my current position **(8, 5)**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Where am I?**\n\n- My head: (8, 5)  \n- My body: [(8, 4)] (so, just below me)\n- Apples: (3, 8), (3, 2), (2, 5), (9, 5), (4, 5)\n- Enemy snake: (6, 6) with body at (6, 7)\n- Board size: 10x10.  \n- Last move: I just moved UP from (8, 4) to (8, 5).\n\n---\n\n### **2. What are my possible moves?**\n\n#### UP to (8, 6):\n\n- In bounds (0 ≤ 8 < 10, 0 ≤ 6 < 10)\n- Is it occupied?  \n  - No snake or apple at (8, 6)\n  - Safe\n\n#### DOWN to (8, 4):\n\n- That's my own tail, just came from here. Should not double back (dangerous).\n- Not a good move.\n\n#### LEFT to (7, 5):\n\n- In bounds\n- At (7, 5): nothing (empty), safe\n\n#### RIGHT to (9, 5):\n\n- In bounds\n- Apple here!\n- Is (9, 5) occupied?  \n  - No body or snake occupies (9, 5)\n  - Moving here will eat the apple and grow.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evaluate the options**\n\n**DOWN** is not a real option (my own body is there).\n\n- **UP (8, 6):** keeps me alive, but not directly toward an apple. Might be setting up for a swoop-down later, but doesn't net an immediate apple.\n- **LEFT (7, 5):** also safe, not toward an apple immediately, but maybe toward (4, 5)-(2, 5).\n- **RIGHT (9, 5):** I eat an apple, grow, and gain a point! I am moving to the edge, but next turn I have space at (9, 6) and can survey options.\n\nAre there any dangers going RIGHT?  \n- Am I getting close to being trapped? Let's see:  \n  - After moving RIGHT, my body is at (8, 5), and my tail will stay at (8, 4) (since I grow, tail doesn't move).\n  - I have open squares above (9, 6) or down (9, 4), and left (8, 5).  \n  - Safe for the next several turns.\n\nThe enemy is far away (6, 6).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Strategy Check**\n\nWe always want to maximize point collection when safe! Getting the (9, 5) apple right now is the highest-value move. The only concern is being near the board edge, but there is space, and my body is short (so I have flexibility after eating).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Next-Turn Consideration**\n\n- After eating the apple and growing, watch if the enemy approaches the central apples at (4, 5) or (2, 5).\n- Plan to back down/left if threatened, or go up if space allows.\n- Don't let myself get boxed in at the edge.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED MOVE: RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n**Move:** RIGHT\n\n### **Next-turn focus:**\n- From (9, 5), re-evaluate:  \n  - Is (9, 6) free? Can I safely go UP to make space?\n  - Or, should I reverse (LEFT) back into the center of the board?\n- Watch the enemy's movement (they might angle for the (4, 5) apple). Prioritize survival, but get apples where possible!\n\n---\n\n**MOVE: RIGHT**",

So (9, 6) is free.\n- **Apple?** No\n- **Safe.**\n\n#### 2. **DOWN** (9, 4)\n\n- **In bounds:** Yes.\n- **Occupied?** No. (My body isn't here.)\n- **Apple?** No.\n\n#### 3. **LEFT** (8, 5)\n\n- **In bounds:** Yes.\n- **Occupied?** My own body is at (8, 5) – that's my neck. **Cannot go LEFT!**\n\n#### 4. **RIGHT** (10, 5)\n\n- **In bounds:** No. Would crash into the wall. **Not possible.**\n\n---\n\n### **Selection Reasoning**\n\n- Only legal moves are **UP (9, 6)** and **DOWN (9, 4)**.\n- Both are safe, and both are empty.\n\n#### **Should I go UP or DOWN?**\n\n- Is there any nearby apple? None at y=4 or y=6 near column 9, but an apple is at (8,7). That's up-left from here.\n- My body is at (8, 5), (8, 4) – so if I go UP, then later LEFT-UP puts me towards that (8, 7) apple.\n- Board center apples: (4, 5), (2, 5), (3, 8), (3, 2)\n- Enemy is at (6, 5). That's a bit far, but heading toward the center may cause a collision eventually; plus, I am 6 columns away from the enemy's head, so not immediately threatened.\n\n#### **Is there a difference between going UP or DOWN?**\n\n- **If I go DOWN:** \n    - My next options: LEFT (8, 4), but that's my own body (tail). Not allowed unless my tail moves away, but since I grew last turn, tail did **not** move (snake has length 3). So, next turn, my tail will start moving, but for **this** move, it's still there.\n    - If I go DOWN to (9, 4), I'd have only UP or stay moving DOWN. Not a very dynamic position.\n\n- **If I go UP:**\n    - My new position is (9, 6). Next, I can go LEFT (safe), or UP (further toward top edge), or DOWN (back to where I am now).\n\n#### **Which move gives me more options for apples and flexibility?**\n- **UP** at (9, 6) leads me closer to (8, 7) in one or two moves (LEFT-UP from there), and keeps me in open space.\n- **UP** also avoids doubling back near my own tail, which may still be blocking me for a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Note**\n- **UP** gives me more breathing room at top right and paths leftward toward the (8, 7) apple, then the rest of the apples, while staying away from the enemy in the center.\n- After moving UP, I should look toward pivoting LEFT at first safe opportunity to get toward apples. Be ready to zig-zag down the right edge if enemy approaches upper center.\n\n---\n\n## **DECIDED MOVE: UP**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \n- From (9, 6): If possible, go LEFT toward (8, 7) apple; otherwise, keep an eye on board center and enemy snake's movement.\n- Always try to increase options and avoid being boxed in at the edges.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:** UP",

Manhattan distance: |3-7| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- (1,9): distance = |1-7| + |9-7| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- (3,2): farther away\n- (2,5): farther away\n\nThe best apple to approach is (3,8). Ideal to move closer by reducing x or increasing y.\n\n## **Step 5: Choose Move Toward the Target**\n\n- **LEFT (6,7):** Progresses closer to (3,8) on x-axis; remains flexible for future UP moves if needed.\n- **UP (7,8):** Brings us to the same vertical as the apple, but horizontal progress will still be needed. Staying in the same file longer may make it harder to maneuver around our own tail.\n- **DOWN** does not help, and **RIGHT** is deadly.\n\n### Is UP immediately better?\nIf we alternate LEFT/UP we are progressing diagonally. Since our tail is further right behind us (8,7)–(9,6)–(9,5), moving LEFT stays safely ahead of it, and avoids getting boxed in at the edge as we chase apples.\n\n## **Step 6: Predictive Check — Any Dangers Going LEFT?**\nMoving to (6,7) is safe; my body is not there, enemy is far, and next turn, repeating LEFT/UP will keep us toward the apples.\n\n## **Conclude**\n\n### Move Choice:\n- **Preferred:** LEFT (to 6,7)\n- Next turn, likely continue LEFT again or UP, always moving toward (3,8).\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:**\n- Keep checking enemy progress.\n- Watch my own tail to avoid self-blocking, especially as I get longer.\n- Keep heading LEFT/UP, slightly favoring LEFT for diagonal approach to (3,8).\n- If enemy moves toward apples (is unlikely this turn), may need to speed up or switch to (1,9) if closer.\n\n---\n\n**Move:** LEFT\n\n---",

Less direct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Check for Hazards**\n\n- Is (8,8) safe next turn? Yes, as of now.\n- Is my own body a threat if I go DOWN? My current tail: [(9,9),(9,8)] → will move forward as well.\n\n---    \n\n### **Step 6: Predict Next Steps**\n- Move DOWN to (8,8) now.\n- Next turn, if safe, move DOWN again to (8,7) to eat the apple.\n- If needed (enemy approaches), can always break off and approach left apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion & Strategy**\n- Prioritize apples closest and accessible: (8,7) in two moves.\n- After that, can continue to next closest apple based on enemy movement and route safety.\n- Keep an eye on potential tail position to not get boxed in.\n- Enemy not a threat this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Move for this turn:**  \n**DOWN** (to (8, 8))\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nIf safe, continue DOWN to eat (8,7).

My strategy is working exactly as planned - I'm just one move away from the apple at (1, 9).\n\nCurrent apple positions and distances from my position (1, 8):\n- (1, 9): 0 horizontal, 1 up = 1 move (SO CLOSE!)\n- (3, 8): 2 right, 0 vertical = 2 moves\n- (3, 2): 2 right, 6 down = 8 moves\n- (5, 2): 4 right, 6 down = 10 moves\n- (7, 3): 6 right, 5 down = 11 moves\n\nThe enemy snake (1) is at position (7, 7) with body at [(8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9)].

I'm about to collect my first apple at (1, 9). After I get this apple, I'll grow to length 5 and can then efficiently move toward the apple at (3, 8) which will only be 2 moves away (right, right).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (1, 9), I'll be at the top edge of the board. I should then move RIGHT toward (3, 8) to collect the second apple. The path would be: RIGHT to (2, 9), then RIGHT to (3, 9), then DOWN to (3, 8).

          "rationale": "Let's think through the situation carefully given the updated board and my last move:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Where am I now?**\n\n- My head: **(7,7)**  \n- My new body: [(8,7), (8,8), (8,9)]  \n    - I moved LEFT from (8,7) to (7,7).\n- Enemy snake head: (1,8) (top left region; not an immediate concern)\n- Apples left:\n    - (3,8)\n    - (3,2)\n    - (1,9)\n    - (5,2)\n    - (7,3)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Enumerate safe moves from my current position**\n\nCurrent position: **(7,7)**  \nCheck immediate adjacent spaces for danger (walls, my own body, enemy):\n\n- **UP → (7,8):**\n    - Free? Yes—no body at (7,8).\n    - Edge of board? No.\n    - Is this closer to apples? Slightly, since (3,8) is up-left.\n- **DOWN → (7,6):**\n    - Free? Yes.\n    - Any risk? Low—no snake bodies here.\n- **LEFT → (6,7):**\n    - Free? Yes.\n    - Any risk? No.\n- **RIGHT → (8,7):**\n    - Free? No! My own body segment is here; this would kill me.\n\nSo: UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe. RIGHT is blocked by my own body.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Which move is best? (Strategic direction analysis)**\n\n#### **Where are the apples in relation to me?**\n- (3,8): left and up (distance: |7-3| + |7-8| = 4+1=5)\n- (1,9): further left and up (distance: |7-1| + |7-9| = 6+2=8)\n- (3,2): left and down (distance: 4+5=9)\n- (5,2): left and down (distance: 2+5=7)\n- (7,3): directly down (distance: 0+4=4)\n\n#### **Let's order by proximity:**\n- (7,3): 4 steps (my column, just four down)\n- (3,8): 5 steps (left 4, up 1)\n- (5,2): 7 steps\n- (1,9): 8 steps\n- (3,2): 9 steps\n\n#### **Who is closest to each apple, me or the enemy?**\n- Enemy is at (1,8), so closest to (1,9), somewhat to (3,8). We're unlikely to get (1,9) easily.\n\n#### **If I go UP:**\n- Move to (7,8). Next, could go LEFT to (6,8), then to (5,8), etc., heading directly for (3,8) (available apple and 2nd closest).\n\n#### **If I go DOWN:**\n- Move to (7,6), next to (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), fast approach to (7,3), which is the closest apple.\n- There are also apples further left and down at (5,2), (3,2).\n\n#### **If I go LEFT:**\n- Move to (6,7), keeping center-left and more flexible, but no apple is directly to my left horizontally.\n\n#### **Which route is safer and tactically wiser?**\n- **DOWN**: Most direct, nobody else seems to be near (7,3), fastest guaranteed apple.\n    - Enemy is far, so I can likely secure this apple.\n    - After (7,3), I can angle left toward the other two apples below: (5,2) and (3,2).\n    - My own body is far above; I am not blocking myself.\n    - Keeps me away from the walls and out of the crowd.\n- **UP then LEFT**: Aiming for (3,8). However, enemy is somewhat close (their head at (1,8)), so risk of racing for apple.\n- **LEFT**: Flexible center, but slower path to apples than much more direct DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Decision**\n\n- **Move DOWN to (7,6):**\n    - This sets me on a straight shot for (7,3), the closest, least-contested apple.\n    - Safe and keeps my options open, since center and lower board is open behind me.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Next Turn:**\n- Keep heading **DOWN** toward (7,3). If enemy suddenly approaches from the left, assess, but otherwise continue descent for a guaranteed point.\n- After eating (7,3), shift left towards (5,2) or (3,2).\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake in case they round the top for center-left apples.\n\n---\n\n# **Move: DOWN**",

NOT safe.\n- **DOWN** → (7,5): Free? Yes; no snakes or bodies there.\n- **LEFT** → (6,6): Free? Yes; board is open.\n- **RIGHT** → (8,6): Free? Yes; board is open.\n\nSo current SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT  \nUP is blocked (my own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Proximity to Apples**\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- (7,3): Straight down (|7-7| + |6-3| = 3)\n- (7,1): Down same column (|7-7| + |6-1| = 5)\n- (3,2): Left & Down (|7-3| + |6-2| = 4+4=8)\n- (5,2): Left & Down (|7-5| + |6-2| = 2+4=6)\n- (3,8): Left & Up (|7-3| + |6-8| = 4+2=6)\n\nOrder of proximity:\n1. (7,3): 3 steps (DOWN)\n2. (7,1): 5 steps (DOWN)\n3. (5,2)/(3,8): 6 steps (LEFT/DOWN), (3,2): 8 steps\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Move Analysis**\n\n### **DOWN (to 7,5)**\n- *Best path to (7,3)*: Keep going straight down, nobody in way.\n- The cell is empty, not a wall or snake.\n- After (7,3): immediate left gives access to more apples (5,2), (3,2).\n- Safest, least likely to run into my body or an enemy.\n\n### **LEFT (to 6,6)**\n- Opens option to pivot towards center apples (5,2), (3,2).\n- No apples to immediate left; may be less efficient for apple collection than going straight DOWN now, since (7,3) is closest.\n\n### **RIGHT (to 8,6)**\n- Moves toward right wall (less apple density), gives little strategic advantage.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Enemy Snake Risk**\n\n- Enemy head is at (1,9). Nowhere near any of my possible paths, certainly not going for (7,3) or (7,1).\n- No body segments block my route down.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Decision**\n\n- **DOWN** offers the highest reward, with minimal risk, aiming right for (7,3) — my fastest apple.\n- Avoid UP (blocked).\n- LEFT/RIGHT keeps me flexible, but at the cost of a slower, less direct apple pursuit.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Strategy**\n\n- After moving DOWN, keep heading toward (7,3). \n- If uncontested and I eat it, move toward (7,1) or angle left to (5,2), depending on enemy position.\n- Watch that my tail moves out of blocking path (don’t circle back into my own body!).\n\n---\n\n# **MOVE: DOWN**",

No, but is empty? Let's look.\n    - My body: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) -- none at (7,2).\n    - (7,2) is empty (no snake, no wall), so DOWN is safe.\n- **LEFT** = (6,3): Check for body: nope. Check for other snake: enemy is on far left near (3,8). So (6,3) is empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** = (8,3): Any snake? No. Edge is at (9,*), so (8,3) is safe.\n\nSo, three possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Which Move is Best?**\n\nCheck which move best advances me towards apples (and doesn't trap me):\n\n- **DOWN (7,2)**:\n    - Immediate path towards apple at (7,1) below (and close to (6,1) on the left).\n    - No blockages; open.\n    - No part of my current body is at (7,2).\n    - Not a wall (y=2 is valid).\n    - No enemy threat.\n\n- **LEFT (6,3)**:\n    - Would put me closer to (6,1) apple, but is further from (7,1) apple that's almost directly beneath.\n    - No danger, but not as direct.\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**:\n    - Heads toward board edge. Not efficient for apples; (8,6) is up and right, but no path upwards soon and that's a detour.\n\n### **Visualizing advancing DOWN:**\n\n- Move DOWN to (7,2), then next step can be still DOWN to (7,1) to grab the next apple.\n- After that, possibly LEFT to (6,1) for another apple.\n\n### **Trap risk?**\n\n- My body will continue to trail above, but open spaces to my left/right for escaping once I reach (7,1).\n- Enemy snake is nowhere close.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Quick Planning Ahead**\n\n- After eating apple at (7,1), priority to move LEFT to (6,1) for another apple, then evaluate which (3,2) / (5,2) is closest next.\n- Must avoid circling back up into own body, so keep track of my tail's advance.\n- If enemy approaches later for central apples, watch for routes that maximize escape.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary/Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Continue downwards to collect apple at (7,1) next.\n- After, head left to (6,1), then adjust path to apples at (5,2) or (3,2).\n- Stay aware of the growing body length and available exits.\n\n---\n\n# **MOVE: DOWN**",

This is the fastest point for growth and points.\n- **Other apples**: \n  - (3,2): Further left, could be reached after (5,2)\n  - (5,1): Below and left (but would take two moves (LEFT then DOWN), but (5,2) is closer)\n- **Enemy is not near (5,2) or (3,2)**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Safety**\n\n- **LEFT to (5,2):** Nothing dangerous; only thing to check is what happens after eating the apple (your tail will not move, so your new head will be at (5,2), and your body will be [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)].  \n- After this, next apples: (3,2) is just two to the left, or (5,1) can be hit by going DOWN next.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enemy Snake Threat?**\n\n- Enemy snake is at (4,5)—on top left of you, more than two tiles away, not a threat for the next several turns.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Next Turn Options**\n\n- After going LEFT to get (5,2): \n  - **Option 1: Continue LEFT to (4,2), then (3,2) apple**\n  - **Option 2: DOWN to (5,1), collect apple there**\n- Both options have minimal risk, as body's not in way, and enemy snake too far.\n- It's good to collect nearby apples fast, so LEFT to (5,2) is clearly best.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n- **LEFT to (5,2)** is SAFE, collects an apple, and gives good options for further apples.\n- After this, can decide whether to go for (3,2) or (5,1) based on enemy movement and own positioning.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- From (5,2): Reassess; likely continue toward (3,2) (LEFT, LEFT), but if enemy moves toward that path, consider DOWN to (5,1).\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Move:**\n\n**LEFT**",

Apple at (3, 2): Can reach by going LEFT then DOWN twice\n2. Apple at (5, 1): Can reach by going RIGHT then DOWN three times, but enemy snake is close\n3. Apple at (8, 6): Further away but accessible\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 2) is very close to the apples at (5, 1) and potentially threatening the (3, 2) apple as well. I need to be strategic about which apple to pursue.\n\n**Best move analysis:**\n- LEFT to (3, 4): This puts me on a direct path to the apple at (3, 2), which seems like the safest target since it's furthest from the enemy snake's current position\n- RIGHT to (5, 4): This would put me closer to the enemy snake and in potential competition for the (5, 1) apple\n- DOWN to (4, 3): Keeps me flexible but doesn't commit to any particular apple\n\nI think LEFT is the best move. It positions me to grab the apple at (3, 2) on my next turn, which should be relatively safe from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (3, 4), continue DOWN to (3, 3), then DOWN again to (3, 2) to collect the apple.

ILLEGAL.\n\n## Step 3: Prioritize Apples\n\nWe have two apples nearby:\n- **(5,1):** Directly below; can grab right away by moving DOWN.\n- **(3,2):** Two steps left—need to move LEFT, then LEFT again.\n\nAfter eating either, my snake will grow and tail will not move.\n\n## Step 4: Assess Risk/Safety\n\n- **DOWN to (5,1):** Safe, not running into my own body. Will grow. Next, choices will likely be lateral moves (either left to (4,1) then (3,2), or up toward center).\n- **LEFT to (4,2):** Also safe, and opens path to (3,2). But there is no immediate apple—need another move to get to (3,2).\n- **UP to (5,3):** Safe but does not get an apple.\n\n**Enemy Snake:** The head is at (4,4), and the enemy is not likely to contest either (5,1) or (3,2) in the next turn or two—their body is more up/left-focused, far from the action here.\n\n## Step 5: Pathing/Next Moves\n\nBoth (5,1) and (3,2) are low risk. However, going DOWN to (5,1):\n- Immediately grows.\n- After that, (4,1) is safe; then from there, (3,2) is only two moves away: (LEFT to 3,1) then (UP to 3,2).\n- This path lets me collect two apples in short succession with minimal risk.\n\nAlternatively, if I go LEFT to (4,2):\n- Next go LEFT to (3,2) for apple #1.\n- From there, could either loop down to (5,1) or decide next steps based on enemy moves.\n\nComparing both: **DOWN to (5,1)** secures an apple now and keeps open routes to both (3,2) and more central areas after growing.\n\n## Step 6: Strategic Thought\n\n- Take immediate apples when they are safely available.\n- After collecting (5,1), assess whether the (3,2) apple is still safe to target, or if enemy positioning has changed (otherwise, continue to pursue it).\n- Avoid boxing myself in; focus on maintaining access to the left side and central columns for future apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- After going DOWN to (5,1), re-assess the safety and viability of moving toward (3,2) apple, or switch direction based on enemy positioning.\n- Try to maximize growth while staying out of boxed-in situations.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Move:**\n\n**DOWN** (to (5,1), to immediately collect an apple and grow)\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: DOWN**",

Doesn't bring me closer to any apple and increases risk of getting boxed in.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enemy Snake Analysis**\n\n**Enemy head at (4,4):**\n- Too far from (3,2) apple to contest immediately. The (3,2) is not at immediate risk.\n- Their body is in the upper left; we have local apple advantage.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Optimal Path & Safety**\n\n- **LEFT to (4,1)** is safe, brings me near apple at (3,2) via a straightforward route, and doesn't corner me.\n- **DOWN to (5,0)** is less ideal: takes me to the edge, away from apples, and could risk getting squeezed against the south wall.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Planning Ahead**\n\n- Plan: Go LEFT to (4,1), then another LEFT to (3,1), then UP to (3,2) for apple.  \n- Always check for blocks/self-collision with tail movement, but currently safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Unless board/elements change drastically, continue toward the (3,2) apple.\n- After picking (3,2), re-assess for the next apple (likely central or upper right).\n\n---\n\n## **Decided Move:**  \n**LEFT**\n\n---\n\nNext Move: **LEFT**",

This is exactly what I planned\n- LEFT to (2, 3): Safe - empty space\n- RIGHT to (4, 3): Safe - empty space\n\n**Apple locations:**\nThe apples are at: (3, 2), (8, 6), (9, 9), (6, 7), (9, 3)\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nPerfect! I'm in the exact position I wanted to be in. The apple at (3, 2) is directly below me, and I can collect it by moving DOWN. This will give me a point and make my snake grow by one segment.\n\nThe enemy snake at (4, 1) is still not threatening my immediate path.

The apples at (8, 6) and (6, 7) are relatively close to each other on the right side of the board, while (9, 9) and (9, 3) are further away.\n\n**Best move:**\nDOWN to (3, 2) to collect the apple! This executes my planned strategy perfectly.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After collecting the apple at (3, 2), I'll need to avoid going UP immediately since that would put me back where I came from. I should consider moving RIGHT or LEFT to start positioning myself toward the next cluster of apples. The apples at (8, 6) and (6, 7) seem like good next targets since they're on the right side of the board where there's more open space.\n\nDOWN",

Too far from the apple at (3,2) to contest in time.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: List ALL Legal Moves from (4,1)**\n\nLet's check each adjacent coordinate:\n\n- **UP (4,2):**  \n    - Is it safe? Let's check:   \n    - Is (4,2) in my body? Let's see:  \n        - My body after moving LEFT: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)]  \n        - (4,2) is NOT in this set.  \n    - Is it a wall? No, in bounds.  \n    - Is an enemy there? No.  \n    - **UP is LEGAL.**\n- **DOWN (4,0):**\n    - Is it in my body? Let's check: No.  \n    - In bounds.  \n    - No enemy.  \n    - **DOWN is LEGAL.**\n- **LEFT (3,1):**\n    - Is it in my body? Let's check: No.  \n    - In bounds.  \n    - No enemy.  \n    - **LEFT is LEGAL.**\n- **RIGHT (5,1):**\n    - That's a segment of my own body (from previous position), so NOT LEGAL.\n\n### Summary of legal moves:  \n- UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Safety and Goals**\n\n### Aiming for the Apple at (3,2):\n\n- **Current plan:** Get to (3,2).  \n- **Best path:** From (4,1):  \n    - LEFT to (3,1)  \n    - Then UP to (3,2) for the apple.\n\n**Is LEFT to (3,1) safe?**\n- Is that spot (3,1) occupied?  \n- Let's check my new body: after moving to (4,1), tail will move forward, so (7,5) will be dropped at this next move; (3,1) is clear.\n\n- **What about after that -- is UP to (3,2) safe?**\n    - (3,2) will only have my tail moving further away, and the enemy is 2+ moves away; the risk is minimal.\n\n**Is there a risk of getting boxed in?**\n- After eating the apple, my body gets longer, but my tail will still be vanishing behind me, continually shifting up the 'train.' Plus, being along the edge with an escape route back to the right is available.\n\n### Alternative Moves\n\n- **UP to (4,2)**:  \n    - This puts me one tile above (4,1), and kind of in parallel with (3,2) and (3,1) (the apple).  \n    - However, getting to the apple at (3,2) from (4,2) will take longer: it would require LEFT to (3,2) (unless I approach from top), but that risks running into the snake coming from above in rare circumstances.  \n    - Also, no direct apple at (4,2).\n\n- **DOWN to (4,0):**  \n    - Puts me at the very bottom edge, and to reach the apple I have to swing back up and around anyway. Not optimal and may risk getting boxed later.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enemy Assessment**\n\n- Enemy is at (4,4) and can't reach (3,2) before me, and there's no contest for the southern apple. No immediate risk.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Next Moves Outlook**\n\n- **LEFT to (3,1):**  \n    - Followed by UP to (3,2) for the apple. Safe path.  \n    - After eating the apple, I'll need to quickly re-assess for pathing toward next apple, probably aiming for the least contestable one (potentially (8,6) if safe).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Final Check**\n\n- Final check for tail collisions or surprise body overlaps:  \n    - My current tail is receding away from the left approach.  \n    - No enemy body between me and the apple at (3,2).  \n    - (3,1) is definitely free.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Decision & Strategy**\n\n**Move:**  \n- Move LEFT to (3,1), optimally positioning up for the apple at (3,2) next move.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**  \n- If board state is similar, plan to move UP to (3,2) and eat the apple.\n- After eating, reassess: see if the (8,6) apple is safely reachable, check enemy positions, and watch for any blockage appearing on the left or from above.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Move:**  \n**LEFT**\n\n---\n\n### Next Move: **LEFT**",

This is dangerous.\n- The enemy snake's body extends from (4, 1) through (7, 3)\n\n**Movement options from (3, 2):**\n- UP to (3, 3): DEATH - that's where my body is\n- DOWN to (3, 1): DEATH - that's where the enemy snake's head is\n- LEFT to (2, 2): Safe - empty space\n- RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe - empty space\n\n**Remaining apple locations:**\nThe apples are now at: (8, 6), (9, 9), (6, 7), (9, 3), (2, 5)\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nI'm in a bit of a tight spot.

Their head at (3,2) could go to (3,3) (but it’s part of their own body), so they are ‘stuck’ for now and won't interfere with me.\n\n- **Legal moves from (3,1):**\n    - **UP:** (3,2) — Apple!\n    - **DOWN:** (3,0)\n    - **LEFT:** (2,1)\n    - **RIGHT:** (4,1)\n\n- **Immediate goal:** Eat the apple at (3,2), which is directly UP from my current position.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Safety Check**\n\n- **UP (3,2):**\n    - Is (3,2) occupied? No.\n    - Anyone contesting it? Enemy #0's body is up top at (3,3), but their head is not close by.\n    - **If I move UP, I get the apple.**\n\n- **Other directions:**  \n    - **DOWN (3,0):** Empty. No strategic value.\n    - **LEFT (2,1):** Empty. Could be a route if there was a threat, but not optimal now.\n    - **RIGHT (4,1):** My own body segment. Not allowed.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Post-Move Projections**\n\n- **If I take UP:**  \n    - My head lands at (3,2); I eat the apple and will **grow** by 1.\n    - My body will be: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)] (tail holds its position instead of moving).\n    - Next, the closest apple is (2,5), otherwise (8,6), (9,9), (6,7), (9,3). The area above (3,2) is a bit blocked — (3,3) is enemy body, and the enemy themselves encircle the upper left. After eating, I'll need to swing right or left, not up, to avoid trapping myself.\n\n- **Is there any risk of being trapped immediately after eating the apple?**\n    - At (3,2), UP (3,3) is a wall of enemy body.\n    - RIGHT (4,2): let's check if free.\n        - My current body: after this move, (4,2) is not in my body. Free.\n    - LEFT (2,2): Let's check if free. Also not part of my body. Free.\n    - DOWN (3,1): I just came from here, will not be my body after this move since I grew by 1, so it's clear.\n\n- **After eating, optimal escape is RIGHT or LEFT.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enemy Assessment**\n\n- Enemy is boxed into the upper left. Unless they do something tricky, they're not contesting me for apples in the bottom or center.\n- **No threat from the enemy here.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Strategic Outlook**\n\n- **Immediate Plan:**  \n    1. Move UP to (3,2), eat the apple.\n    2. Next, get out—either LEFT or RIGHT, as up is blocked.  \n    3. Assess which apple is next easiest to reach: probably (2,5) (if left is free), otherwise (8,6).\n- **Note:** After eating, enemy body is still above, so do NOT go UP again or you risk being boxed in. Prefer RIGHT if space is free.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Decision**\n\n- Move UP to (3,2), eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Reminder:**  \nDON'T GO UP after eating—scout RIGHT and LEFT for open passage toward next apple.\n\n---\n\n**Move:** UP",

My body is at [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\n\n**Current position analysis:**\n- My head is at (3, 2)\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3, 1) - directly below me! This is dangerous.\n- The enemy snake's body extends from (4, 1) through (7, 3)\n\n**Movement options from (3, 2):**\n- UP to (3, 3): DEATH - that's where my body is\n- DOWN to (3, 1): DEATH - that's where the enemy snake's head is\n- LEFT to (2, 2): Safe - empty space\n- RIGHT to (4, 2): Safe - empty space\n\n**Remaining apple locations:**\nThe apples are now at: (8, 6), (9, 9), (6, 7), (9, 3), (2, 5)\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\nI'm in a bit of a tight spot. The enemy snake is directly below me, and my own body is above me. I need to move either LEFT or RIGHT to avoid immediate death.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (2, 5) is to the upper left - could be reached by going LEFT then UP\n- (6, 7) and (8, 6) are to the upper right - could be reached by going RIGHT then navigating around\n- (9, 3) and (9, 9) are on the far right edge\n\nSince the enemy snake occupies a lot of space on the right side of the board (positions 4-7 on the bottom), going LEFT might give me more maneuvering room. The apple at (2, 5) is also relatively close if I go LEFT.\n\n**Best move:**\nLEFT to (2, 2) - this gives me space to maneuver and positions me to potentially go for the apple at (2, 5).\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving LEFT, I should consider going UP toward the apple at (2, 5), or continue LEFT to get more space from the enemy snake. I need to be careful not to box myself in and keep multiple escape routes open.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's think this through step by step.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: New Current State Assessment**\n\n- **After the last move:**  \n    - I moved LEFT, so my head is now at **(3,1)**.  \n    - My body after the move: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)] — tail moved forward one segment.\n    - The apple at **(3,2)** is directly above me—one step up!\n    - Enemy #0's head is (3,2), and their body is up at (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), etc.  \n    - Enemy #0’s next head move must be determined. Their head at (3,2) could go to (3,3) (but it’s part of their own body), so they are ‘stuck’ for now and won't interfere with me.\n\n- **Legal moves from (3,1):**\n    - **UP:** (3,2) — Apple!\n    - **DOWN:** (3,0)\n    - **LEFT:** (2,1)\n    - **RIGHT:** (4,1)\n\n- **Immediate goal:** Eat the apple at (3,2), which is directly UP from my current position.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Safety Check**\n\n- **UP (3,2):**\n    - Is (3,2) occupied? No.\n    - Anyone contesting it? Enemy #0's body is up top at (3,3), but their head is not close by.\n    - **If I move UP, I get the apple.**\n\n- **Other directions:**  \n    - **DOWN (3,0):** Empty. No strategic value.\n    - **LEFT (2,1):** Empty. Could be a route if there was a threat, but not optimal now.\n    - **RIGHT (4,1):** My own body segment. Not allowed.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Post-Move Projections**\n\n- **If I take UP:**  \n    - My head lands at (3,2); I eat the apple and will **grow** by 1.\n    - My body will be: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)] (tail holds its position instead of moving).\n    - Next, the closest apple is (2,5), otherwise (8,6), (9,9), (6,7), (9,3). The area above (3,2) is a bit blocked — (3,3) is enemy body, and the enemy themselves encircle the upper left. After eating, I'll need to swing right or left, not up, to avoid trapping myself.\n\n- **Is there any risk of being trapped immediately after eating the apple?**\n    - At (3,2), UP (3,3) is a wall of enemy body.\n    - RIGHT (4,2): let's check if free.\n        - My current body: after this move, (4,2) is not in my body. Free.\n    - LEFT (2,2): Let's check if free. Also not part of my body. Free.\n    - DOWN (3,1): I just came from here, will not be my body after this move since I grew by 1, so it's clear.\n\n- **After eating, optimal escape is RIGHT or LEFT.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Enemy Assessment**\n\n- Enemy is boxed into the upper left. Unless they do something tricky, they're not contesting me for apples in the bottom or center.\n- **No threat from the enemy here.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Strategic Outlook**\n\n- **Immediate Plan:**  \n    1. Move UP to (3,2), eat the apple.\n    2. Next, get out—either LEFT or RIGHT, as up is blocked.  \n    3. Assess which apple is next easiest to reach: probably (2,5) (if left is free), otherwise (8,6).\n- **Note:** After eating, enemy body is still above, so do NOT go UP again or you risk being boxed in. Prefer RIGHT if space is free.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Decision**\n\n- Move UP to (3,2), eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Reminder:**  \nDON'T GO UP after eating—scout RIGHT and LEFT for open passage toward next apple.\n\n---\n\n**Move:** UP",
