Obtaining this apple will not only advance my score but also allow me to grow, further enhancing my position on the board.\n\n### Enemy Analysis:\n- The enemy snake (Snake #0) is far away at (2, 2), so there is no immediate threat from them as I focus on acquiring the apple.\n\n### Future Thoughts:\n- After moving UP and picking the apple, my new position will be (7, 8) with a longer body. From (7, 8), I will have options to continue my strategy of moving towards new apples, either at (9, 8) or redirect if needed.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turns:\n- Prioritize obtaining apples while ensuring mobility and avoiding traps. Keep track of enemy locations and maintain a flexible position.
