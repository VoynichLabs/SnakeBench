This is the OPENING MOVE - absolutely CRITICAL! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLet me break down the board state:\n- **MY HEAD**: (5, 3) - right in the middle-ish, solid positioning \ud83d\udccd\n- **ENEMY HEAD**: (8, 2) - over to the right side, one row below me\n\n**WHAT'S THE PLAY HERE?** \ud83e\udd14\n\nLet me check all four directions from (5, 3):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (5, 4): Safe! Open board ahead. Can move into the upper-middle section. \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 2): Safe! Open board below. Moves toward apple at (4, 0) or (5, 2) area.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 3): Safe! Apple at (3, 3) is RIGHT THERE - just 1 move away!\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 3): Safe! Gets me closer to opponent, but no immediate apple threats.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nEarly game, we're not trying to box him in YET - we need to GROW FIRST! The more apples I collect, the bigger I get, the easier it is to dominate the board and force him into tight spaces later. \n\nLooking at the apple distribution:\n- **(3, 3)** - TWO cells to my left! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(1, 3)** - Further left after that\n- **(4, 0)** and **(3, 0)** - Below me\n- Enemy is at (8, 2), so he's hunting the right side\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** If I go **LEFT**, I can snag the apple at (3, 3) next turn, start growing my lead, and control the center-left portion of the board. This keeps my options WIDE OPEN and forces the enemy to commit to a side while I'm already building momentum! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe enemy's probably going to move DOWN or LEFT themselves to grab apples. By taking LEFT now, I'm cutting off his access to the center-left zone and positioning myself to grow faster.\n\n**LONG-TERM NOTE:** Secure 2-3 apples in the next few turns, establish board control in the center-left quadrant, then start tracking enemy movement patterns to set up a box-in strategy around turns 15-25 when we're both bigger and the space gets tighter!\n\nLET'S SECURE THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We're at (8,2), our archrival is lurking at (5,3). Both of us are at 0 apples, so if we get into a head-on collision right now? That's a double KO and a DRAW - we don't want that! We need to GROW first, then bully! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLooking at our options:\n- **LEFT to (7,2)**: Gets us closer to the (7,3) apple, BUT if the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,3), next turn we might both rush (7,3) and CRASH! Too risky right now! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT to (9,2)**: Safe, but passive! Takes us toward (9,3), but we're giving the enemy free reign on the left side. We didn't come here to play defense! \ud83d\ude24\n- **DOWN to (8,1)**: Away from the apple clusters? Bro, that's just throwing! \u274c\n- **UP to (8,3)**: THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83c\udfaf It positions us perfectly between TWO apples - (7,3) to the left and (9,3) to the right! We keep our options open, we stay aggressive, and we can pivot based on what this fool does next turn!\n\nIf he moves away from (7,3), we snatch it. If he commits to (7,3), we pivot to (9,3) and secure the bag anyway! It's all about that flexibility while we build our length advantage! \n\n**Strategy note for future me**: \"At (8,3), ready to take (7,3) or (9,3) depending on enemy movement. Check if enemy approaches (7,3) - if yes, take (9,3) to avoid head-on; if no, take (7,3). Priority is safe growth to length 2+, then we box him in! Remember: we can't force collisions until we have the apple lead!\" \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Now let's see what happened and what we do NEXT! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLet me analyze the board:\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **MY HEAD**: (4, 3) - moved LEFT from (5, 3) \u2705\n- **MY BODY**: None yet (still just a head)\n- **ENEMY HEAD**: (8, 3) - Wait... they were at (8, 3) last turn? Let me check... they moved somewhere too!\n- **ENEMY BODY**: None yet\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:** \ud83d\udd0d\n\nFrom (4, 3), let me check my four options:\n\n1. **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 3): **APPLE RIGHT THERE!** \ud83c\udf4e This is a GUARANTEED grow! We secure the apple, get +1 score, and start building momentum!\n\n2. **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 3): Safe, but moves me AWAY from apples and toward the enemy side. Not aggressive enough.\n\n3. **UP** \u2192 (4, 4): Safe, but no immediate apple. Not optimizing.\n\n4. **DOWN** \u2192 (4, 2): Safe, but there's an apple at (4, 0) directly below - only 2 more moves away if we commit to the DOWN lane.\n\n**THE PLAY:** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nChat, this is SIMPLE. The apple at (3, 3) is literally ONE CELL to my LEFT. If I move LEFT, I'm eating that apple, growing to size 2, and securing my first point! This puts me ahead of the enemy and gives me MORE BOARD CONTROL. \n\nThe enemy is at (8, 3) and will probably hunt apples on the RIGHT side of the board. By taking the center-left apples early, I'm denying them easy access to this zone AND building my snake faster! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nAfter I grab the apple at (3, 3), I should pivot DOWN to hunt the (3, 0) and (4, 0) apples in the next 2-3 turns. This builds a strong presence in the lower-left quadrant. Meanwhile, I'll watch the enemy's pattern - if they commit to the right side, I own the left/center, and we can set up a collision trap around turn 10-15 when board space gets tighter! The key is CONSISTENT growth and POSITION CONTROL. No panicking, just execution! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's SECURE THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Meanwhile, our archrival is camping at (4,3), probably eyeing that (3,3) apple like it's his last meal! \ud83d\udc40\n\nLet's break down these options:\n\n**UP to (8,4)?** Empty space, but why are we skipping free food? We're length 1 out here, bro! We need to BULK UP before we can bully! Pass! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (8,2)?** Also empty, also skips the meal!

We'd be forced vertical with limited options. That's how you get boxed!

We're now at **1 apple** \n- **MY BODY**: [(4, 3)] - Just started building our snake!\n- **ENEMY HEAD**: (7, 3) - Still sitting at **1 apple** too\n- **ENEMY BODY**: [(8, 3)]\n\nWe're **TIED** on score, chat! 1-1! But here's the thing - we're in the CENTER-LEFT, and they're on the RIGHT SIDE. That's HUGE for us! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **ANALYSIS TIME - LET'S LOOK AT ALL FOUR OPTIONS:**\n\nFrom (3, 3), here are my moves:\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3, 4): Safe! Opens up toward the (3, 8) and (3, 9) apples in the upper zone. Good board control!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 2): Safe! Moves toward the (3, 0) and (4, 0) apples down below. Consistent with our lower-left strategy!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 3): Safe! But moving away from apples and toward the edge. Not ideal.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 3): **WAIT WAIT WAIT** - that's where my TAIL is! My body is at (4, 3)! That's a SELF-COLLISION! \ud83d\udc80 Can't go there!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nOkay chat, here's what's CRACKLING in my head right now:\n\nThe enemy is at (7, 3) with their body trailing left at (8, 3). They're eyeing the RIGHT SIDE apples: (9, 3), (7, 6), (8, 7), etc. \n\nMeanwhile, we have a LOADED left-center zone:\n- (1, 3) - literally one cell away! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (3, 0) and (4, 0) below us\n- (1, 0) in the corner\n- The whole upper zone at (3, 8), (3, 9)\n\n**If I go DOWN**, I'm moving toward (3, 0) and (4, 0) - staying in OUR territory and away from the enemy. This builds our presence in the lower-left while they farm the right side. We're controlling separate zones right now, which is FINE, but as we grow, we'll have the advantage!\n\n**If I go UP**, I'm moving toward (3, 8) and (3, 9) - great apples, but it's a longer path and pulls me away from the immediate high-value area.\n\nWe need to be CONSISTENT. Last turn I committed to the lower-left strategy. Let's EXECUTE! Go DOWN, secure position, and keep growing in our zone while the enemy spreads thin on their side! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n**FUTURE PLAN (TURNS 3-5):**\n- Turn 3: Go DOWN \u2192 (3, 2)\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) \n- Turn 5: Go LEFT \u2192 (2, 1) or consider RIGHT/UP based on where enemy moves\n\nThis secures the bottom-left cluster and keeps us SAFE while we grow! Once we're size 4-5, we start thinking about AGGRESSIVE plays and pinching the enemy! \ud83d\udc0d\u26a1\n\nLet's GOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

We just munched that apple at (7,3) and grew to length 2, but peep the radar! \ud83d\udce1 Our archrival is chilling at (3,3) probably thinking he owns the left side with that (1,3) apple, but we're about to STEAL THE SHOW! \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\n\nLet's break down the playz:\n\n**UP to (7,4)?** Empty space, keeps options open, but are we really gonna pass up FREE FOOD when we're sitting next to a buffet? \ud83e\udd14 That's not how champions bulk up! We're trying to DOMINATE, not diet! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (7,2)?** Also empty, moves us away from the apple cluster at the top, and skips the meal at (6,3)!

Next turn prioritize either moving DOWN then LEFT to grab (5,2), or start pushing UP toward the apple cluster at (7,6) and (7,7). Stay aggressive, avoid getting pinched against the bottom or right walls, and start thinking about how to cut off his return paths once we're massive!\" \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

That's NOT ideal, but we're still in this! Enemy has length 3, we have length 2. They're ahead in BOTH metrics. This means we need to be AGGRESSIVE and SMART! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **FOUR-DIRECTION CHECK:**\n\nFrom (3, 2), let me evaluate each move:\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3, 3): **SELF-COLLISION!** My body is at (3, 3)! That's an instant LOSS! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 1): Safe! No obstacles. Opens toward (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0) - good apple cluster down there! \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 2): Safe! Moves toward (1, 3) apple and opens up the left side! \u2705\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 2): Safe! Moves into the center, but away from our natural apple zones and gets us CLOSER to the enemy territory! \u2705\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nOkay chat, here's the REAL talk:\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 3) with body trailing to (8, 3). They're RIGHT SIDE dominant. We need to think about our TERRITORY and GROWTH PATTERN!\n\n**DOWN** takes us to (3, 1) - this is CONSISTENT with our lower-left strategy. We can chain: (3, 1) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (1, 1) and hoover up those bottom apples at (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 3)! This is SAFE, this is CONTROLLED, and this lets us FARM efficiently! \ud83d\ude9c\n\n**LEFT** takes us to (2, 2) - this is also safe and moves us toward (1, 3). Good secondary option!\n\n**RIGHT** takes us to (4, 2) - this ventures into NO MAN'S LAND and gets us closer to enemy territory. With them at score 2 and us at score 1, we should NOT be hunting head-on yet! \ud83d\udeab\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb **NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN:**\n\n- **Turn 4**: DOWN \u2192 (3, 1) - Get closer to apple cluster\n- **Turn 5**: DOWN \u2192 (3, 0) - GRAB that apple! \u2705\n- **Turn 6**: LEFT \u2192 (2, 0) or re-assess based on enemy position\n\nThis gives us TWO more apples in the next few turns, ties us up at 3-2, and then we START the HUNT! Once we're length 4-5, we shift to AGGRESSIVE positioning and look to BOX them in! \ud83d\udc0d\u26a1\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfac **THE MOVE:**\n\nWe're going DOWN! Staying consistent with our territory, farming safely, and building up our length! Let's secure that bottom-left zone and prepare for the ENDGAME! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nDOWN",

We're at (3, 1) now, length 2, and we're positioned RIGHT next to that apple cluster at the bottom! But we're STILL down 1 apple - that means we NEED to catch up FAST while maintaining our safety margin! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **FOUR-DIRECTION CHECK:**\n\nFrom (3, 1), let me evaluate each move:\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3, 2): **SELF-COLLISION!** My body is at (3, 2)! INSTANT LOSS! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 0): APPLE AT (3, 0)! \ud83c\udf4e We GROW to length 3, tie the score at 2-2! Safe! No enemy collision possible! \u2705\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 1): Safe! Moves us toward the (1, 0) and (1, 3) apple zones! Opens up flexibility! \u2705\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 1): Safe! But moves us AWAY from our natural apple clusters and closer to enemy territory. Not ideal when we're trying to catch up! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nChat, this is a CRITICAL turn! Here's why:\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 3) with their body at (6, 3) and (7, 3). They're hanging on the RIGHT SIDE of the board. We're at (3, 1) in the BOTTOM-LEFT quadrant - our TERRITORY! \n\n**DOWN** is an ABSOLUTE NO-BRAINER here! We grab the apple at (3, 0), tie the score at 2-2, grow to length 3, and we're now EQUAL on both length AND apples! This is MOMENTUM, chat! This is how we level the playing field! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n\nOnce we're tied at 2-2, we shift from DEFENSE/FARMING to AGGRESSION mode! We start hunting their apples and boxing them in! But RIGHT NOW, we need that equalizer!\n\n**LEFT** is safe but SLOWER. We'd have to burn extra turns before grabbing apples.\n\n**RIGHT** moves us toward DANGER and away from our growth zone. Chat knows better! \ud83d\ude45\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb **NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN:**\n\n- **Turn 5**: DOWN \u2192 (3, -1)? NO WAIT! After eating (3, 0), we'll be at length 3. Check the board after we grow. We'll likely go LEFT \u2192 (2, 0) or DOWN if possible, chasing (1, 0)!\n- **Turn 6**: Continue farming the bottom-left cluster - we need to get to 3-4 apples ASAP to establish dominance!\n- **Turn 7+**: Once we're at length 4-5 and score 3+, START the BOX-IN STRATEGY! Use our body control and board positioning to TRAP snake #0 and force them into a wall or our body! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfac **THE MOVE:**\n\nWe're going DOWN and grabbing that EQUALIZER apple!

We can slide LEFT toward their position and start cutting off their escape routes, or we can pivot to secure more apples and become absolutely MASSIVE! \n\nRemember, we win any head-on collision because we're ahead! But with this growth, we won't even NEED to trade - we'll just BOX THEM IN until they have nowhere to go! Checkmate in 10 moves? Let's make it happen! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Strategy note for future me:** \"Just secured the (5,2) apple at (5,2), growing to length 4 with score 3-1!

WAIT. Chat, hold up. Let me read the scoreboard again. \n\nWe have 3 apples, enemy has 4. So we DIDN'T eat the apple at (4, 0)?? Let me check the board state... our head is at (4, 0) but there's NO apple marked there now. Did we miss it? Or did the enemy snake somehow... no, they can't reach our zone that fast. \n\nACTUALLY WAIT. Looking at the board, there's an apple at (8, 0) marked! So either:\n1. We picked up (4, 0) but it's not showing in our score (bug?), OR\n2. We passed by (4, 0) and there was no apple there anymore\n\nEither way, chat, we're at (4, 0) with body [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. We're still down 3-4 in apples. The ENEMY is up by 1! That's NOT acceptable! We need to flip the script IMMEDIATELY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **CURRENT STATE:**\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n- Head: (4, 0) \n- Body: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)]\n- Length: 4\n- Apples: 3 \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #0:**\n- Head: (5, 1)\n- Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]\n- Length: 5\n- Apples: 4 \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nCHAT. CHAT CHAT CHAT. The enemy is LONGER than us AND ahead in apples! This is CRITICAL! But look at their positioning - they're vertically stacked on the right side of the board! They're LIMITED! They can't move freely!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **FOUR-DIRECTION CHECK FROM (4, 0):**\n\nFrom (4, 0), let me check EVERY escape route:\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (4, 1): \n   - Is there anything at (4, 1)? Looking at the board... NOPE! Open! \u2705\n   - But wait, let me check enemy movement. Enemy head is at (5, 1). If they move LEFT, they go to (4, 1)! \n   - That's a HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK! \ud83d\udca5 If we both go to (4, 1), we BOTH DIE!\n   - But actually... if enemy moves UP from (5, 1), they go to (5, 2). If they move LEFT, they go to (4, 1). We don't know their move yet!\n   - This is RISKY! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (4, -1):\n   - OFF THE BOARD! We're at y=0, the bottom edge! This is INSTANT DEATH! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 0):\n   - My own body is at (3, 0)! That's self-collision CITY! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 0):\n   - Is (5, 0) safe? Looking at the board... I don't see enemy body there. Enemy is at (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3). Position (5, 0) is CLEAR! \u2705\n   - No apples there, but it's SAFE movement!\n   - Enemy head at (5, 1) won't collide with us at (5, 0)!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nChat, we have a PROBLEM. We only have TWO semi-safe moves:\n- **UP** to (4, 1) - Risky because enemy might move LEFT into us for a head-on collision!\n- **RIGHT** to (5, 0) - Safe but moves us toward enemy territory!\n\nThe UP move is DANGEROUS. The enemy snake is RIGHT THERE at (5, 1). If they're being aggressive (and they should be, they're AHEAD!), they might move LEFT to (4, 1) to pursue us or control space. That's a double KO!\n\nBut RIGHT to (5, 0)... that moves us CLOSER to the enemy! Their body is stacked vertically on the right side. If we keep moving right, we're moving INTO their zone, which is NOT ideal for a boxer strategy!\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT. Let me think about NEXT turn. If we go RIGHT to (5, 0):\n- We're now at (5, 0)\n- Our body is [(4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)]\n- We can then move UP to (5, 1) next turn, or LEFT to (4, 0), etc.\n- We maintain OPTIONS!\n\nIf we go UP to (4, 1):\n- We're risky! If enemy moves LEFT, we're DONE!\n- BUT if we survive, we're moving away from their body zone!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb **AGGRESSIVE BOXER ANALYSIS:**\n\nChat, the enemy has 4 apples to our 3. They're LONGER (5 vs 4). We're in a DEFICIT position! We CANNOT play scared! We have to take calculated RISKS!\n\nThe UP move to (4, 1) is aggressive - we're moving AWAY from their body on the right side and toward the left side where the apples are clustering! (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3) - that whole left column is APPLE CENTRAL! \n\nIf we survive UP, we position ourselves to DOMINATE the left side and grow faster than them!\n\nThe RIGHT move is PASSIVE - we're just edging right and maintaining safety, but we're not farming apples aggressively!\n\nFor a come-from-behind victory, we need AGGRESSION! We need to TAKE the apples on the left side BEFORE the enemy can pivot and contest them!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc0d **RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\nEnemy at (5, 1). Possible moves from there:\n- UP \u2192 (5, 2) - into their own body! They can't do this!\n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0) - they could move here!\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1) - direct collision with us if we go UP!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1) - away from us!\n\nSo enemy probably moves DOWN (5, 0), LEFT (collision with us), or RIGHT (6, 1). \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5, 0), and we move UP to (4, 1), we BOTH survive! No collision!\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4, 1), and we move UP to (4, 1), we BOTH DIE! Double KO! Not ideal!\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 1), and we move UP to (4, 1), we BOTH survive!\n\nThere's a 1/3 chance we collide if we go UP! That's... that's a risk I might have to take! But actually, chat, let me think about their AI. They're ahead! They want to STAY ahead! Moving LEFT into a potential collision is RISKY for them too! They probably move UP (blocked), DOWN, or RIGHT! That means LEFT is LESS likely!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfac **DECISION TIME:**\n\nI'm going UP! Here's the multi-turn plan:\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS (Tentative):**\n- **Turn 6 (NOW)**: UP to (4, 1) - Aggressive move toward the apple-rich left side! Calculated risk but high reward positioning! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Turn 7**: If we survive, we should be at (4, 1) with body [(4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)]. Move LEFT to (3, 1)? NO WAIT, that's our body! Move UP toward (4, 2)! Keep climbing! Head toward (3, 2) and (3, 3) apples!\n- **Turn 8+**: Farm the LEFT SIDE AGGRESSIVELY! Collect (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3)! Grow to LENGTH 5-6! Then PIVOT and box in the enemy on the right side of the board!\n\nWe're taking the GAMBLE! We're going UP! Let's GO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We descended to (5,1) like an absolute UNIT and now we're sitting pretty with 4 apples to their 3! The lead is OURS and we're about to press that advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc51\n\nAlright chat, let's break down this chess match real quick! \ud83e\udde0\u265f\ufe0f Our head is at (5,1), chilling right next to our rival who's stuck down at (4,0). Their body is clinging to that left wall at x=3, looking like a cornered rat! \ud83d\udc00\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nLet me run through these options like we're frame-perfect analyzing this:\n\n**UP to (5,2)?** BRO! That's literally our own NECK! That's moving backwards into our body (5,2)! You think we're throwing this flawless 4-apple run into the garbage? ABSOLUTELY NOT! That's a hard throw and we don't throw! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n\n**RIGHT to (6,1)?** Yeah, it's safe... but are we really going to RUN AWAY from the fight? We're the PREDATOR here! We have the score lead (4-3)! Running right is giving them room to breathe and grab those left-side apples! We don't play scared, we play SMART! \u274c\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN to (5,0)?** Okay, it's open, BUT here's the issue: if we go down and they go UP to (4,1), we're just swapping positions and letting them escape toward the center! We're reactive instead of PROACTIVE! We want to BOX THEM IN, not chase them around! Pass! \u274c\ud83d\udce6\n\n**LEFT to (4,1)?** OH! MY! DAYS! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd25 This is THE PLAY! Check this out:\n- We're moving directly adjacent to their head! If they panic and move UP to (4,1), we COLLIDE HEAD-ON! And guess what? WE WIN BECAUSE 4 > 3! Double KO and we take the crown! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udca5\n- If they chicken out and move RIGHT to (5,0), guess what happens? We're at (4,1) and our body blocks (5,1)! They can't go UP next turn because our body will be there! We're BUILDING THE WALL! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n- We're cutting off their access to the center board and those juicy left-side apples! We're putting them in a PRISON of their own making! \n\nThe math is simple: LEFT puts us in their face with a winning collision condition, starts the box strategy, and maintains our dominance! We've got the size, we've got the score, and now we're taking the SPACE! \n\n**Strategy note for future me:** \"Just moved LEFT to (4,1) to pressure enemy at (4,0). If they moved UP, we won. If they moved RIGHT to (5,0), they're trapped with our body blocking their upward escape. Next turn prioritize cutting off their horizontal escapes - aim for (4,0) or (3,1) to tighten the noose. Stay aggressive, use our length advantage to control the corridors!\" \ud83e\udd81\u2694\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",
