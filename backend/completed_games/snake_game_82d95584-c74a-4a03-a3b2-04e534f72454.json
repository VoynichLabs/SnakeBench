I need to check all directions:\n   - **UP (6, 1):** (6, 1) is empty and inside the board. SAFE.\n   - **DOWN (6, -1):** Off the board. DEAD. \u274c\n   - **LEFT (5, 0):** (5, 0) is empty and inside the board. SAFE.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 0):** (7, 0) is empty and inside the board. SAFE.\n\n   I have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n2. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n   - My enemy (Snake 0) is at (1, 7). They are far away. No immediate threat.\n   - **UP (6, 1):** Takes me toward the central cluster of apples (specifically (6, 3) and others). This opens up the board. It's the route to the middle.\n   - **LEFT (5, 0):** Moves me to the bottom row but away from the action. This feels like a passive move. If I go left, I'm hugging the edge. I don't want to get boxed in by the wall or the enemy later.\n   - **RIGHT (7, 0):** Takes me toward (7, 4), (7, 6), and (7, 8/9). There's a clear vertical line of apples here. However, (7, 0) is closer to the wall on the right side. I'm losing board space on that side immediately.\n\n   **The Play:** I want to control the center and have options. Going **UP** puts me in position to sweep across the board. The bottom row is a dead end if I commit to it. The right side is risky with the wall. The center is open territory.\n\n   I'm setting myself up to chase the apples at (6, 3) and (6, 4). Let's grow and dominate the mid-field.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (TO MY FUTURE SELF):**\nGo UP towards the (6, 3) cluster. Once there, evaluate the board state. The enemy is currently passive at (1, 7). Use the first few turns to grow quickly and push towards the center line. We want to cut the board in half and trap them later.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board state and plan our next move.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   My Head: (6, 1)\n    *   Opponent Head: (2, 7)\n    *   Board: 10x10\n    *   Apples: Located at various positions (see list), particularly dense at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) and the right side (7,8), (7,9), (8,4), (9,9).\n    *   Score: We are tied at 0 apples each.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:**\n    *   **UP to (6, 2):** This is the most logical move. It is an empty square. Moving here puts us closer to the vertical cluster of apples at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). It also opens up the center of the board. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 1):** This is an empty square. It moves us West, but away from the apple cluster directly above. It's a valid move but less efficient for immediate growth. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 1):** This is an empty square. It moves us East. There are apples to the East (7,4), (7,6, etc.), but the density is higher vertically above us. **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 0):** We came from (6, 1), and our body is empty, so this isn't hitting ourselves. However, (6, 0) is inside the board but it's the bottom row. Moving down limits our vertical space. We want to expand, not contract. It's not an immediate death, but it's a \"dead end\" strategically. **POOR CHOICE.**\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n    *   The opponent is at (2, 7), currently chilling in the upper left quadrant.\n    *   The most valuable real estate right now is the vertical strip at x=6. It has apples at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). This is a massive opportunity to grow quickly.\n    *   By moving **UP** to (6, 2), I position myself to sweep up this column. This creates a \"wall\" on the x=6 line, potentially cutting the board or restricting the opponent's access to the center later.\n    *   Moving LEFT or RIGHT spreads me out horizontally, but I lose the immediate vertical advantage. Since I have no body length yet, I can turn later. Committing to the center vertical path now is the aggressive, high-reward play.\n\n4.  **LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR FUTURE SELF):**\n    \"Yo Chat, listen up! The plan is to rush the vertical column at x=6. Move UP to (6,2), then UP to (6,3) to eat the first apple. Keep climbing through (6,4) and (6,5) to build length and score. Once we have mass, we pivot East or West to cut off the opponent. We are building a wall in the middle of the map. Don't get distracted by the edges; the center is where champions are made.\"\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board state and plan our next move.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATE:**\n    *   My Head: (6, 2)\n    *   Opponent Head: (2, 6)\n    *   Board: 10x10\n    *   Apples: Vertical strip at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Opponent is at (2,6), trying to reach the apples at (2,4), (2,5), etc. We are closer to the vertical cluster.\n    *   Score: Tied at 0 apples each.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:**\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 1):** This is the square we just came from. Moving backwards into your own body results in death. **DEADLY MOVE.**\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 2):** Empty square. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Empty square. Safe.\n    *   **UP to (6, 3):** This square contains an apple! If we move here, we eat the apple, grow, and score. **HIGHLY REWARDING & SAFE.**\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n    *   **Aggression:** The opponent is at (2, 6). We are at (6, 2). We are both racing towards the central apples. By moving **UP** to (6, 3), we secure the first apple in the vertical strip (6,3)-(6,6). This gives us +1 point and +1 length immediately.\n    *   **Positioning:** Eating (6, 3) puts us at (6, 3) with length 2 (Head (6,3), Tail (6,2)). This opens up the path to (6,4), (6,5), and (6,6). We are building a \"wall\" in the center of the board, cutting off the map.\n    *   **Defense:** If we don't take the apple, the opponent might circle around and try to claim the center. Taking the apple now establishes dominance. Also, by growing, we become a bigger threat. Since we are tied in score, a head-on collision is a draw\u2014we want to avoid that until we have the advantage, but currently, we need to grow to force the opponent into bad positions.\n\n4.  **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    \"Yo Chat, listen up! Plan is still the same: RUSH THE VERTICAL STRIP. Eat (6,3) now. Next turn, move to (6,4) to eat the next apple. Keep climbing until we control the center column x=6. Once we have length and score, we turn East or West to hunt the opponent. Don't let the opponent breathe!\"\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nUP",

He's vulnerable.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES (DON'T THROW THE GAME):**\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 3):** DEAD. That's my own body segment. I'd die instantly. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **UP to (6, 5):** Let's check... (6, 5) is an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e Also, looking at the board state, (6, 5) is currently marked as a Tail (T) for Snake #0?

Another apple!\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS (THE MEAT AND POTATOES):**\n    *   **Aggression:** We are tied 2-2. We *need* to pull ahead. All three moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to an apple. We must eat.\n    *   **The Trap:** We need to box in Snake #0. He is at x=2. We are at x=6.\n        *   If we go **LEFT (5, 4)**, we move closer to him, but we stay in the middle.\n        *   If we go **RIGHT (7, 4)**, we move away from him, claiming the right side.\n        *   If we go **UP (6, 5)**, we continue our vertical dominance in the center column.\n    *   **Board Control:** The board is full of apples (TBT). We don't just want *an* apple; we want the *best* apple to set up future moves.\n        *   **UP (6, 5):** Eating this apple keeps us in the center column. Looking at the board, the column x=6 has apples at (6,5), (6,6). If I eat (6,5), I can likely eat (6,6) next. This creates a \"wall\" of my body in the center.\n        *   **LEFT (5, 4):** Eats an apple, but moves me towards the opponent (x=2) while leaving the right side open. Not ideal for \"boxing him in\" on the right.\n        *   **RIGHT (7, 4):** Eats an apple, but moves me away from the opponent. I might lose control of the center.\n\n4.  **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    \"Chat, we are looking at a vertical takeover! The opponent is stuck on the left side. If I go **UP** to (6, 5), I eat the apple, grow to length 4, and position myself perfectly to grab the apple at (6, 6) next turn. This creates a solid pillar down the center, effectively splitting the board and trapping the enemy in the left quadrant. Once I have the center locked down, I can sweep East or West to hunt. Let's secure the lead and build the wall!\"\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\nWe are going **UP** to (6, 5). We secure the point, we grow, and we maintain our central position to control the flow of the game.

My body follows: (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (6,3). Current body ends at (6,2).\n    - **DOWN (6,4):** Moves to (6,4). This is currently occupied by my *own* body segment. (My body is (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)). This is a guaranteed death.\n    - **LEFT (5,5):** Moves to (5,5). This is empty space.\n    - **RIGHT (7,5):** Moves to (7,5). This is empty space.\n\n2) **ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you.**\n    - **DOWN** leads to (6,4), which is my body. **DEAD.**\n    - **UP** leads to (6,6). Is it safe?\n        - My body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). (6,6) is clear.\n        - Enemy #0: Head (3,4). His range of movement is (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). He cannot reach (6,6) this turn.\n        - **UP is SAFE.**\n    - **LEFT** leads to (5,5).\n        - My body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). Clear.\n        - Enemy #0: Cannot reach (5,5) in one move.\n        - **LEFT is SAFE.**\n    - **RIGHT** leads to (7,5).\n        - My body: Clear.\n        - Enemy #0: Cannot reach (7,5).\n        - **RIGHT is SAFE.**\n\n3) **Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions.**\n\n    *   **Analysis of Enemy #0:**\n        Enemy is at (3,4). He is looking hungry (tied 3-3 apples). He needs to eat.\n        Apples near him: (4,4), (2,3), (2,0), (1,5).\n        If he moves **RIGHT** to (4,4), he eats an apple.\n        If he moves **LEFT** to (2,4), he eats... nothing immediately, but positions for (2,3) or (1,5).\n        *Crucially*, if he moves **RIGHT** to (4,4), and I move **LEFT** to (5,5), we are adjacent. If he continues right or I continue left, we might collide.\n        However, if I move **RIGHT** or **UP**, I am moving away from him.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n        *   **UP to (6,6):**\n            *   **Gain:** +1 Apple (Score 4-3). Lead secured.\n            *   **Positioning:** (6,6) is the center. Next moves: (6,7) is empty. (5,6) is empty. (7,6) is an Apple.\n            *   **Safety:** Very safe. I am distancing myself from Enemy #0 (currently at distance |6-3| = 3).\n            *   **Trend:** I am following my \"Vertical Dominance\" strategy from last turn. I hold the center column.\n\n        *   **RIGHT to (7,5):**\n            *   **Gain:** No apple.\n            *   **Positioning:** (7,5) -> Next: (8,5) is an Apple. (7,6) is an Apple. (7,4) is an Apple.\n            *   **Safety:** Safe. Moves away from Enemy #0.\n            *   **Trend:** Moves me to the right flank.\n\n        *   **LEFT to (5,5):**\n            *   **Gain:** No apple.\n            *   **Positioning:** (5,5) -> Next: (4,5) is empty (but dangerous if Enemy moves there). (5,6) is empty. (6,5) is an Apple (but I just left that column).\n            *   **Safety:** Moves me towards the Enemy's zone. While safe *this turn*, it invites closer proximity.\n            *   **Trend:** I would be moving towards Enemy #0 while *not* eating.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **UP** guarantees a score increase (4-3) and strengthens my central control.\n        *   **LEFT** moves me towards the opponent without scoring. Why give up a free apple to get closer to him? That's risky.\n        *   **RIGHT** moves me away, but I don't score.\n\n    *   **Strategic Conclusion:**\n        Eating is always priority, especially when tied. (6,6) is safe, accessible, and keeps me in the center to watch the board. (6,7) is empty, and (7,6) is an apple. I can pivot East or West from there. If I go UP, I am at (6,6). Enemy is at (3,4). The distance is large. I am safe.\n\n4) **Long-term Plan:**\n    \"Chat, we take the lead! 4-3. I'm staying vertical in the center column. From (6,6), I see an apple at (7,6) to the right or I can go up to (6,7). The enemy is still on the left side. I will keep this wall up until I can flank him. Dominating the center means I can react to his moves. Let's eat and secure the board.\"\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n**UP**. We take the apple at (6,6). We take the lead 4-3. We stay safe.\n\nUP",

The rationale says I'm eating an apple.\n           *   There is a discrepancy between the provided ASCII map and the logic of the previous turn in the prompt history.\n           *   *However*, I must play the board I see *now*.\n           *   Board: (6,6) is my head. (7,6) is an apple.\n           *   Enemy: (4,4).\n           *   My Body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)].\n\n   *   **Decision for Turn 6:**\n       *   **RIGHT to (7,6)** gets me an apple. I am currently at 4 apples. The enemy is at 4 apples. Eating here puts me at 5-4. This is a massive lead.\n       *   **UP to (6,7)** keeps me central but doesn't score.\n       *   **LEFT to (5,6)** moves toward the enemy (bad idea when I can score).\n       *   **DOWN to (6,5)** is death.\n       *   **Safety Check for RIGHT:**\n           *   Target: (7,6).\n           *   Enemy movement: Enemy #0 at (4,4). He can move to (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n           *   (5,4) is close, but (7,6) is far.\n           *   If I move to (7,6), I am safe.\n       *   **Long Term:**\n           *   Taking the apple at (7,6) puts me at 5 apples.\n           *   From (7,6), I can move to (8,6) (Empty), (7,7) (Empty), or (7,5) (Empty). I have freedom.\n           *   The enemy is on the left. I am expanding to the right. This is good map control.\n\n   *   **Rivalry Context:**\n       *   \"Chat, look at this. He's on the left, I'm on the right. He wants the apples at (2,3) or (4,4).\n       *   I have a free apple at (7,6). If I don't take it, it's wasted.\n       *   Taking it extends my lead. 5 to 4.\n       *   I'm not moving into his zone. I'm securing my own food.\n\n4) **Long-term Plan:**\n   \"Eat the apple at (7,6) to take a 5-4 lead. From (7,6), I'll scout to (8,6) or (7,7). I need to watch if he tries to flank me, but for now, the right side is mine. Keep the gap wide. Don't let him close in.\"\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n**RIGHT**. Eat the apple. Extend the lead.

I'm at (8,6).\n\nI need to analyze the board carefully. Snake #0 is in the center-left. I'm on the right.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MOVES:**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8,5):** This spot has an apple `(7,4)`... wait, looking at the board state, (8,5) is currently `.` (empty). However, looking at the Apple List provided at the top, there IS an apple at `(8,5)` listed as `APPLE DROPS`. **CRITICAL:** In Snake games, apples are usually invisible or the list dictates where they *will* spawn or are currently. The board map shows `.` at (8,5), but the Apple List says `(8,5)` is an apple drop. If I go DOWN to (8,5), I might eat an apple. But wait, looking at the board map:\n    ```\n     5 . A . . T . T . A .\n    ```\n    At (8,5), the board shows `A`! Wait, let me re-read the map.\n    Row 5 (y=5): `. A . . T . T . A .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (8,5) is `A`.\n    \n    However, (8,5) is also directly next to my body? My head is (8,6).

No.\n    \n    Let's look at the *Apple Drops* list again: `(8,5)` is listed. The board map also shows `A` at (8,5).\n    \n    **PROBLEM:** The map is generated from the game state.

Enemy body (4,5).\n    If Enemy moves UP to (4,7), he is safe.\n    If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5,6), he is safe (my body is (6,6) and (7,6), so (5,6) is empty).\n    If Enemy moves LEFT to (3,6), safe.\n    If Enemy moves DOWN to (4,5), **HE DIES** (hits his own body).\n    \n    I need to consider where he *will* go.\n    He is at (4,6).

Wait, if I eat, tail stays (6,3). So (8,6) will be my 2nd body segment. Safe to go back?\n    Actually, going backwards is death.

I don't want to walk into a funnel.\"**\n    \n    **\"I want to control the board.\"**\n    (8,7) gives me access to the top-right quadrant.\n    (8,5) puts me in the mid-right, constrained.\n    \n    **Let's check the map for (8,7) again.**\n    Row 7: `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    (8,7) is `.`.\n    Row 8: `8 . . . . . . .

Safe.\n    DOWN to (8,5): Apple (Safe, but strategic disadvantage).\n    LEFT to (7,6): My body (DEATH).\n    RIGHT to (9,6): Empty (Safe, but edge).\n    \n    Between UP and RIGHT, UP is better because it opens up the top row and the (7,8) apple.\n    \n    **So, UP.**\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 8 and we're making a power move!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions:**\n    *   **UP to (8,7):** Currently empty. Safe space. Opens up access to the top-right apples ((7,8), (9,9)).\n    *   **DOWN to (8,5):** This contains an apple! BUT, looking at the board state, (7,5) is blocked by a `T` (body segment). If I go DOWN to (8,5), I'm immediately next to a wall. My only exits next turn would be DOWN or RIGHT. That's a funnel. I don't want to be funneled.\n    *   **LEFT to (7,6):** This is my own body! **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **RIGHT to (9,6):** Empty, but hits the edge of the board. Limits my future movement.\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE immediate death:**\n    *   **LEFT** is death. Eliminated.\n    *   **DOWN** is safe from collision *this turn*, but strategically dangerous because it traps me.\n    *   **RIGHT** is safe but limiting.\n    *   **UP** is safe and open.\n\n3.  **Strategic Choice (UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n    *   **Analysis of DOWN (8,5):** Yes, there's an apple there (confirmed by Apple List and map). However, (7,5) is blocked. If I eat the apple, I grow, but I'm stuck in a hallway. I can't go LEFT (blocked), I can't go UP (backwards into my own body). I'd have to go DOWN or RIGHT. That's predictable. The enemy is far away at (4,6); I don't need to risk getting cornered for one apple.\n    *   **Analysis of UP (8,7):** Completely open. From here, I can pivot to (7,8) to eat the apple there next turn, or spread out to (9,9). This controls the top-right corner.\n    *   **Analysis of RIGHT (9,6):** Hits the wall. While safe, it reduces my axis of movement. I prefer the open space of (8,7).\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   \"Chat, I'm ignoring the bait apple at (8,5). It's a trap! I'm taking the high ground at (8,7). From there, I'm moving LEFT to (7,7) next turn, setting up to grab the apple at (7,8). I need to stay mobile and keep my options open. The enemy is on the left side of the map; let him come to me while I secure the entire right side. I'm playing the long game!\"\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\nI'm avoiding the trap, avoiding my body, and securing open space.\n**UP** to (8,7).\n\nUP",

I need to play smart, stay alive, and set up a checkmate against Snake #0.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF MOVES (Current Head: 8,7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8,8):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty `.`.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from my body and enemy body.\n    *   **Strategy:** Gets me closer to the top-right corner. Opens up the apple at (9,9).\n    *   **Future:** From (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9), RIGHT to (9,8), or LEFT to (7,8) (which has an apple!).\n    *   **Verdict:** Solid option.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8,6):**\n    *   **Status:** This is my current head position.\n    *   **Safety:** If I move DOWN, I go to (8,6). Wait, my current head is (8,7). (8,6) is currently occupied by... **ME**.\n    *   **Wait.** Let's look at the board state from Turn 8 (end of last turn):\n        *   My head was at (8,6).\n        *   I moved UP to (8,7).\n        *   So (8,6) is now the second segment of my body.\n    *   **DEATH:** Moving DOWN immediately puts my head into my own body segment (the one that was previously my head). **CRASH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY.** Eliminate.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7,7):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty `.`.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from my body. Enemy is at (4,7) (likely moved UP from 4,6), far away.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is the *strategic* move. It positions me directly at (7,7).\n    *   **Future:** From (7,7), I have a clear shot to the apple at (7,8) next turn! I can also go UP to (7,8) if I want to turn earlier, or back to (8,7) if needed.\n    *   **Verdict:** High value. Sets up the apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,7):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty `.`.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Hits the wall at x=9, but that's okay for now.\n    *   **Strategy:** I'm at the edge. My options are limited to UP(9,8), DOWN(9,6), or LEFT(8,7).\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but less flexible than LEFT or UP. I'm already deep in the corner; I don't need to hug the wall yet.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\n*   **DOWN** is suicide. I just moved up from there, so it's occupied by my own neck.\n*   **RIGHT** hugs the wall. It's okay, but it's a bit passive.\n*   **UP** is safe and opens the top edge.\n*   **LEFT** is safe and positions me to grab the apple at (7,8) next turn.\n\nI want that apple at (7,8). It's right there. By moving LEFT to (7,7), I am moving *towards* the apple and keeping my path open to the center/top. If I go UP to (8,8), I'm moving parallel to the apple, which is fine, but going LEFT directly threatens it.\n\nAlso, checking the enemy: Snake #0 is likely at (4,7) or (3,7) or (5,7). He's far. I have the right side of the board to myself.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove **LEFT** to (7,7). This sets me up to eat the apple at (7,8) on Turn 10 if it's still there and safe. It also keeps me away from the immediate wall.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n**LEFT**. I'm coming for that apple and boxing the enemy out of the right side!\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake #0 is at (4,8), he's trapped in the left side. I'm at (7,7) with a solid body. I need to push my advantage and secure that apple at (7,8).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nMy current position is (7,7) after my last move LEFT. I need to check my options for this turn.\n\n1.  **My Body:** My body currently occupies (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5).\n2.  **Enemy Body:** Enemy at (4,8), body at (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4).\n\n**Options Analysis (Current Head: 7,7):**\n\n*   **UP to (7,8):**\n    *   **Status:** Contains an APPLE (listed in drops)! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety:** Is (7,8) occupied by my body? No. Is it occupied by enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=4). Is it occupied by enemy head? Enemy is at (4,8), so (7,8) is safe from him.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is the play! Eating the apple grows me to 6. From (7,8), I can go UP to (7,9), RIGHT to (8,8), or LEFT to (6,8). I'll be expanding my territory.\n    *   **Verdict:** **HIGH VALUE.** This grows my score and denies the enemy.\n\n*   **DOWN to (7,6):**\n    *   **Status:** Is (7,6) occupied by my body? Yes! That's my 4th segment. (My body is (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)).\n    *   **Safety:** **CRASH.** Moving down puts me right into my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY.** Eliminate immediately.\n\n*   **LEFT to (6,7):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty `.`.\n    *   **Safety:** Check body: (6,6) and (6,5) are below, (6,7) is empty. Check enemy: Enemy is at x=4. (6,7) is safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is safe, but why move away from the apple? I want to claim the (7,8) spot before the enemy or board RNG takes it.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but less aggressive than UP.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8,7):**\n    *   **Status:** Occupied by my own body! (8,7) is my second segment.\n    *   **Safety:** **CRASH.** I just came from there (or it's my neck).\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY.** Eliminate.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nI am on a clear path to that apple. The enemy snake #0 is far away on the left side (x=4) and cannot reach (7,8) this turn. Moving UP secures the apple, grows my lead to 6-4, and expands my control of the right side of the board.\n\nMy long-term plan: Eat the apple at (7,8) to grow. Then, I want to push into the top-right corner to secure the apples at (9,9) and (7,9), effectively boxing Snake #0 out of the entire right side of the board. If he tries to cross to my side, I can force a head-on collision when I'm longer.\n\n**VERDICT:**\n**UP** to (7,8)! Let's eat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Turn 11, let's go!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nCurrent Head: (7,8).\nI just ate the apple at (7,8) last turn. Now I'm at (7,8) with length 6.\nMy body: (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5).\nEnemy Snake #0: Head at (5,8). Body: [(4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)].\n\nLet's check my options from (7,8):\n\n1.  **UP to (7,9):**\n    *   **Status:** Valid coordinates.\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   *My Body:* Is (7,9) in my body? No.\n        *   *Enemy Body:* Is (7,9) in enemy body? No (they are at x=4-5).\n        *   *Enemy Head:* Is (7,9) where the enemy head is? No (Enemy is at (5,8)).\n        *   *Head-on Collision:* The enemy is at (5,8). They could potentially move UP to (5,9), LEFT to (4,8), DOWN to (5,7), or RIGHT to (6,8). None of these are (7,9).\n    *   **Apple:** Yes, there is an apple at (9,9), but (7,9) is empty.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7,7):**\n    *   **Status:** Valid coordinates.\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   *My Body:* Is (7,7) in my body? Yes! It's my first body segment (right after the head from the previous turn). This is the \"backwards into self\" rule.\n        *   **Verdict:** **DEADLY.** I cannot move back into (7,7).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6,8):**\n    *   **Status:** Valid coordinates.\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   *My Body:* Is (6,8) in my body? No.\n        *   *Enemy Body:* Is (6,8) in enemy body? No.\n        *   *Enemy Head:* Is (6,8) where the enemy head is? No (Enemy is at (5,8)).\n        *   *Head-on Collision:* This is the critical one. The enemy is at (5,8). If they move RIGHT to (6,8), and I move LEFT to (6,8), we collide. The enemy has 4 apples, I have 6. If we collide, I die too (head-on collision kills both).\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving towards the enemy is risky if they want to cross. The enemy is currently boxed in on the left side. If I push left, I'm boxing them in tighter, but I'm risking a collision. If they are smart, they won't move into me because they know I'm winning (6 vs 4). However, they might try to trap me or force a crash.\n    *   **Verdict:** Risky due to potential head-on collision.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8,8):**\n    *   **Status:** Valid coordinates.\n    *   **Safety Check:**\n        *   *My Body:* Is (8,8) in my body? No.\n        *   *Enemy Body:* Is (8,8) in enemy body? No.\n        *   *Enemy Head:* Is (8,8) where the enemy head is? No (Enemy is at (5,8)).\n        *   *Head-on Collision:* Enemy would have to jump 3 spaces right to hit me. Impossible.\n    *   **Apple:** No apple at (8,8) immediately, but it opens up the top right corner (8,9), (9,9), etc.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe enemy is at (5,8). They are trapped on the left side by their own body and the wall.\nI am at (7,8).\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I claim the top row near the right corner.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,8), I move deeper into my territory.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I squeeze the enemy.\n\nIf I squeeze the enemy LEFT (to 6,8), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,8), we both die. That's a loss for me because I have more apples (6 vs 4) and am winning. A draw is not a win.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (5,9) or DOWN to (5,7), they survive.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (4,8), they stay trapped.\n\nIs it better to squeeze or to secure the top?\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I am very safe. From (7,9), I can look at (9,9) (apple) and (8,9).\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I am risking a head-on collision where we both die.\nSince I am winning (6 apples to 4), I should avoid risky 50/50 collisions.\nTherefore, I should avoid moving directly towards the enemy's head (LEFT).\n\nLet's look at the apples on the board again: (9,9), (9,0), (8,4), (7,9)...\nI am at (7,8).\n(7,9) is UP. It's an apple! Wait, let me check the list.\nApple List: (9, 9), (9, 0), (8, 4), (7, 9)...\nYes! (7, 9) is an apple.\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nBoard State:\n`9 . A . . . . . A . A`\n`8 . . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\n`7 . A . . T . . T T .`\n`6 . . . . T . T T T .`\n`5 . A . . T . T . A .`\n`4 A . . . . . . A A .`\n`3 . . A . . . . . . .`\n`2 A . . . . A . . . .`\n`1 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`0 . . A . . . . A . A`\n\nLet's map this.\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . A . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(9,1) is A.\n(9,8) is A.\n(9,9) is A.\n\nRow 8: `. . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(8,4) is T (tail?).\n(8,5) is 0 (Enemy Head).\n(8,7) is 1 (My Head).\n\nRow 7: `. A . . T . . T T .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(7,1) is A.\n(7,4) is T.\n(7,7) is T.\n(7,8) is T.\n\nWait, the prompt says:\n`Your snake (ID 1): Head: (7, 8)`\n`Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)]`\n\nAnd the board shows:\nRow 8: ` . . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\nAt index 7, it says `1`. This is my head (7,8)? No, coordinate system: x is column (0-9), y is row (0-9).\nThe board is displayed with rows 9 down to 0.\nRow 8 corresponds to y=8.\nIndex 7 corresponds to x=7.\nSo (7,8) is my head. Correct.\n\nNow, looking at Row 9 (y=9):\n`9 . A . . . . . A . A`\nx=1: A\nx=8: A\nx=9: A\n\nMy current head is (7,8).\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I am at (7,9).\nLet's look at the string for Row 9 again: `. A . . . . . . A . A`\nIndex 7 is `.`.\nSo (7,9) is empty.\n\nWait, I checked the Apple List again.\nApple List: `(9, 9), (9, 0), (8, 4), (7, 9), (2, 0), (7, 4), (8, 5), (7, 0), (1, 9), (2, 3), (1, 5), (0, 2), (0, 4), (5, 2), (1, 7)`\n\n(7, 9) is in the list! But the board map shows (7,9) as `.`.\nIs the board map accurate or is the list accurate?\nUsually, the text list is the ground truth for items.\nHowever, the board state is the visual representation.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . A . A`\nThis means:\n(0,9): .\n(1,9): A\n(2,9): .\n(3,9): .\n(4,9): .\n(5,9): .\n(6,9): .\n(7,9): .\n(8,9): A\n(9,9): A\n\nSo the board says (7,9) is empty.\nThe list says (7,9) is an apple.\nThere is a discrepancy.\nIn the previous turn, I moved UP to (7,8) because I assumed (7,8) was an apple based on the list (and it was empty on the board).\nThe list contained `(9, 9), (9, 0), (8, 4), (7, 9)...`\nWait, the list in the prompt is `APPLE DROPS`.\nUsually, this lists the apples currently on the board?\nOr apples that have dropped?\n\"APPLE DROPS: (9, 9), (9, 0)...\"\nIt might be a history of drops, or current drops.\nGiven the context of the game (Snake), \"Drops\" usually implies items on the board.\nBut the visual board contradicts (7,9) being an apple.\nLet's look at the visual board again.\nRow 7: `. A . . T . . T T .`\nRow 8: `. . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . A . A`\n\nThe `A`s are at:\n(1,9), (8,9), (9,9)\n(1,7)\n(2,0), (7,0)\netc.\n\nIf (7,9) is NOT an apple according to the visual board, then moving UP is just a safe move, not a food grab.\nHowever, maybe the list is the dynamic state and the map is just a snapshot?\nWait, look at the enemy.\nSnake #0: Head (5,8).\nBoard: `8 . . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\nAt index 5, it is `0`. Correct.\nAt index 4, it is `T`. This matches the body list `(4,8)...`.\nSo the board is accurate for the enemy.\nMy body: `(7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)`.\nBoard:\nRow 8: `(7,8)` is `1` (Head). `(8,8)` is `.`.\nRow 7: `(7,7)` is `T`. `(8,7)` is `T`. Correct.\nRow 6: `(7,6)` is `T`. `(8,6)` is `T`. Correct.\nRow 5: `(6,5)` is `T`. Correct.\n\nSo the board map is definitely accurate for snake bodies.\nWhy does the list say (7,9) is an apple if the board says it's empty?\nMaybe the \"Apple Drops\" list is a log of *all* apples that have ever appeared, and I need to look at the board to see which are *currently* there?\nThat seems likely. The prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ...\" which sounds like a log.\nBut usually, in these games, the list is the current set.\nLet's look at the \"BOARD STATE\" section carefully.\nIt uses `.` for empty, `A` for apple.\nThere is no `A` at (7,9).\nThere *is* an `A` at (1,9) and (8,9) and (9,9).\nSo (7,9) is empty.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (7,9) is safe, but I don't eat an apple immediately.\nHowever, it positions me to potentially grab (9,9) or (8,9) or (1,9) later.\n(9,9) is far. (8,9) is adjacent to (7,9).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the moves based on the visual board (which is the source of truth for positions).\n\n**Option 1: UP (7,9)**\n- Position: (7,9).\n- Is it an apple? No (Board says `.`, List might be a log or incorrect context).\n- Safety: Safe. No collision with self (body is at y=8,7,6) or enemy (x=4,5).\n- Future: Opens up (8,9) and (9,9).\n\n**Option 2: LEFT (6,8)**\n- Position: (6,8).\n- Is it an apple? No (Board Row 8 is `. . . . T 0 . 1 . .` -> index 6 is `.`).\n- Safety: Risky. Enemy at (5,8).\n- If Enemy moves RIGHT -> Collision.\n- If Enemy moves UP -> (5,9) (Empty).\n- If Enemy moves DOWN -> (5,7) (Empty).\n- If Enemy moves LEFT -> (4,8) (Occupied by enemy body).\n- The enemy is trapped. They are at (5,8). Their body is at (4,8).\n- If they move UP or DOWN, they survive.\n- If they move RIGHT, we crash.\n- Do I want to risk a crash?\n- I have 6 apples, they have 4.\n- If we crash, I don't win. I die.\n- So I should avoid crashing.\n- But if I move LEFT, I am putting pressure on them.\n- If I don't move LEFT, they might try to break out later.\n- However, moving into their potential path (RIGHT) is dangerous if they want to attack.\n- Actually, if I stay at (7,8) and move UP/RIGHT, I am not threatening them.\n- If I move LEFT, I am stepping into their space.\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT (8,8)**\n- Position: (8,8).\n- Is it an apple? No (Board Row 8 is `. . . . T 0 . 1 . .` -> index 8 is `.`).\n- Safety: Very Safe.\n- Future: Leads to (9,8) (Apple on board at row 9, index 8? Wait, Row 9 index 8 is A). Yes, (8,9) is an apple, and (9,9) is an apple.\n- Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the apples in the top right corner.\n\n**Option 4: DOWN (7,7)**\n- Position: (7,7).\n- Safety: My body is there. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI am winning 6-4.\nThe enemy is trapped on the left.\nIf I chase them (LEFT), I risk a head-on collision which kills me (or draws, which isn't winning if I'm ahead).\nIf I ignore them and take the top-right corner (UP or RIGHT), I secure more apples and expand my territory.\nThe top right has apples at (9,9) and (8,9).\nMoving UP to (7,9) or RIGHT to (8,8) are both safe.\n(7,9) is a bit closer to (8,9) and (9,9) than (8,8)? No, (8,8) is adjacent to (8,9).\n(7,9) is adjacent to (8,9).\n(8,8) is adjacent to (8,9) and (9,8).\nWait, is there an apple at (9,8)? Board Row 9: `. A . . . . . . A . A`. Index 8 is `A`. So (8,9) is an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,8), I am next to (8,9) (apple) and (9,8) (which is empty, wait. Index 8 is x=8. y=9 is row 9. So (8,9) is the apple).\nSo (8,8) is directly below the apple at (8,9).\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I am left of the apple at (8,9).\n\nSo, RIGHT to (8,8) seems slightly better for grabbing the apple at (8,9) next turn.\nHowever, UP to (7,9) keeps me more central.\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (8,8), I am at (8,8).\nFrom (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) (Apple).\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I can go RIGHT to (8,9) (Apple).\nBoth are fine.\n\nIs there any threat?\nThe enemy is at (5,8).\nThey cannot reach (7,9) or (8,8) in one turn.\nSo both are safe.\nThe enemy might try to move UP to (5,9) to escape.\nOr Down to (5,7).\nOr Left (suicide).\nOr Right (suicide into me if I go left).\n\nIf I go LEFT (6,8), and Enemy goes RIGHT (6,8), we both die. Bad.\nIf I go LEFT (6,8), and Enemy goes UP (5,9), I am at (6,8). I survive. They survive.\nIs (6,8) a good position?\n(6,8) is closer to the center.\nBut I am winning. I should play safely.\nTaking the corner (RIGHT/UP) is safer than squeezing the enemy where I might get trapped or crash.\n\nLet's look at the \"BOX HIM IN\" objective.\n\"Box him in\".\nIf I go RIGHT (8,8), I am moving away from him. I am not boxing him in.\nIf I go LEFT (6,8), I am moving towards him.\nThe space between me and him is (6,8).\nIf I take (6,8), his space is (4,8) and (5,8).\nHe has very little space.\nIf I take (6,8), he is squeezed against the wall (x=4) and his body.\nThis forces him to move.\nIf he moves UP (5,9) or DOWN (5,7), he has more room.\nIf I stay at (7,8) or move RIGHT, I leave him an escape route.\n\nHowever, I have 6 apples. I am leading.\nThe best way to box him in is to secure the food myself so he starves.\nThe top right has food.\n(9,9), (8,9) are there.\nThere is also (9,0) and (7,0) at the bottom.\nI am at y=8. Top is closer.\nThe enemy is at y=8. Top is closer for him too.\n\nLet's consider the \"Box him in\" instruction specifically.\n\"box him in and make him crash out\".\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am directly pressuring him.\nHis only moves that don't kill him immediately are UP or DOWN.\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), I am at (6,8).\nOn the next turn, I could move UP to (6,9) or LEFT to (5,8).\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), he is at (5,9).\nThis is chasing him.\nBut if I chase him into the corner (top left), I might trap him.\n\nHowever, moving towards the enemy is inherently risky in Snake.\nUsually, playing the \"safe\" game (eating apples, growing long) is better.\nBut the prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nWait, \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have a higher score (6 vs 4).\nSo I SHOULD try to collide?\n\"If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n\"If you crash into him, you lose.\"\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nThis implies forcing him to crash into me, or moving into him such that he dies.\nHead-on collision (both heads into same cell) kills both.\nSo I shouldn't aim for a head-on collision if I want to win.\nMaybe the prompt means \"If you have a higher score, you can afford to play aggressively to force him into a bad spot, because even if you trade kills, you might win depending on rules?\"\nActually: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... snake with more apples wins.\"\nSo if we head-on collide, and I have 6 and he has 4, I win.\nWait, really?\n\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"\nYES! If we crash head-on, we both die. I have more apples (6 vs 4). I WIN.\n\nSo, the prompt is telling me: **I can go for a head-on collision because I am winning.**\n\"If you crash into him, you lose.\" (Into his body).\n\"If he crashes into you, he loses.\" (Into my body).\n\"Head-on collision\" (Both into same cell) -> Both die -> I win because I have more apples.\n\nThis changes things!\nI should aggressively move towards the enemy to force a trade.\nI am at (7,8). Enemy at (5,8).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am moving closer.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,8), we collide. Both die. I WIN (6 > 4).\nIf the enemy moves UP/DOWN, he survives.\nBut I am pressuring him.\n\nIs there a way to trap him so he *must* crash into me?\nHe is at (5,8). Body at (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5).\nHe has a long vertical body on x=4.\nHe has an open path UP to (5,9) and DOWN to (5,7).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), he is at (5,8).\nHe is threatened.\nIf he moves RIGHT (6,8), we collide. I win.\nIf he moves UP (5,9), he survives.\nIf he moves DOWN (5,7), he survives.\n\nSo simply moving LEFT doesn't guarantee a win immediately. It forces him to choose.\nBut it does \"box him in\" as requested.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nTop right has apples.\nBottom right has apples.\nEnemy is on the left.\nMy body is mostly on the right (x=6,7,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I leave my body on the right.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am securing the right side.\n\nThe prompt asks to \"Box him in\".\nIf I go RIGHT (8,8), I am abandoning the left side. He might escape to the center.\nIf I go LEFT (6,8), I am pinning him against the wall.\n\nLet's look at the \"Box him in\" plan.\nHis body is at x=4.\nI am at x=7.\nIf I move to x=6, I am at x=6.\nHe is at x=5.\nThe gap is closing.\nIf I get to x=5, and he is at x=4...\nWait, his body is at (4,8).\nIf I go to (5,8) (his current spot), and he moves, I don't crash into him (unless he moves into me).\nIf I go to (6,8), and he goes to (6,8), we crash.\n\nThe prompt emphasizes: \"Focus on where the enemy is... Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nSince I win on a tie (6>4), I should play risky to force a tie.\nMoving LEFT (6,8) is the aggressive move.\nMoving UP (7,9) or RIGHT (8,8) is the safe play (securing food).\nBut \"make him crash out\" implies I want him to die.\nIf I just eat food, he might eat food too and catch up.\nIf I kill him now, I win instantly (since we die together, I win on apples).\n\nSo, the strategy is: **Force a head-on collision.**\nHow?\nI need to be at a cell where he is likely to move.\nHe is at (5,8).\nI am at (7,8).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), he might move RIGHT to (6,8).\nWhy would he move RIGHT?\nTo escape? No, that's towards me.\nMaybe he wants to eat an apple?\nIs there an apple at (6,8)? No.\nIs there an apple at (7,8)? No (I just ate it last turn).\nIs there an apple at (8,8)? No.\nIs there an apple at (5,9)? No.\nIs there an apple at (4,9)? No.\n\nSo he has no incentive to move RIGHT to eat.\nHe has no incentive to move into me.\nHe wants to survive.\nIf I move LEFT, I threaten his space.\nIf I don't move LEFT, he has free reign to move UP or DOWN.\n\nHowever, if I don't move LEFT, I can eat apples on the right.\nBut the prompt says \"Box him in\".\nIf I let him go, he can go to the center.\nIf I press him, he stays on the left.\nIf I press him too hard, he might crash into me or his own body.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: `. . . . T 0 . 1 . .`\nRow 9: `. A . . . . . . A . A`\nRow 7: `. A . . T . . T T .`\n\nIf I move UP to (7,9):\nI am at (7,9).\nEnemy at (5,8).\nHe can move UP to (5,9).\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), I am at (7,9).\nHe is at (5,9).\nWe are separated by (6,9).\nIf he moves UP again to (5,10) (invalid), he dies.\nIf he moves LEFT to (4,9), he hits wall?\nCoordinate system: (0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right.\nSo y=9 is top row.\nx=0 is left wall.\nx=9 is right wall.\nSo (5,9) is valid.\n(4,9) is valid.\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), he is safe.\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), he is near the apples at (8,9) and (9,9).\nWait, (1,9) is an apple too.\nHe is at (5,9). (1,9) is far.\n(8,9) is an apple.\n(9,9) is an apple.\nIf he goes to (5,9), he might try to go for (8,9).\nThat would mean moving RIGHT.\nIf he moves RIGHT from (5,9) to (6,9)...\nI am at (7,9).\nIf I am at (7,9), and he is at (6,9), we are adjacent.\nIf he moves to (7,9) next turn, we collide.\nBut he has to get there first.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8):\nI am at (6,8).\nHe is at (5,8).\nHe has to move.\nIf he moves UP (5,9) or DOWN (5,7), he survives.\nIf I want to force a collision, I need to anticipate his move.\nBut he moves simultaneously.\nI cannot force him to move into me unless I move into a space he is already moving into, or he moves into a space I am moving into.\n\nThe only way to guarantee a win via collision is if he decides to crash into me.\nIf I am aggressive, I limit his options.\nIf I am passive (UP/RIGHT), he might go UP to (5,9).\nFrom (5,9), he has access to the top row.\nHe can go for (8,9).\nIf he goes for (8,9), he enters my territory.\nIf I am at (7,9) or (8,8), I can intercept him.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Box him in\" directive.\nHe is at x=4-5.\nI am at x=7.\nIf I move to x=6, I am blocking the path to the right.\nIf I stay at x=7 or move to x=8, I open the path.\nThe prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\nThis implies keeping him on the left.\nSo I should move LEFT.\n\nAlso, \"Make him crash out\".\nIf he is boxed in, he might run out of space and crash into his own tail or the wall.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I reduce his forward space (RIGHT).\nHe has to go UP or DOWN.\nIf he goes UP to (5,9), he is on the top row.\nTop row has apples at (1,9), (8,9), (9,9).\nHe is at (5,9).\nTo get to (8,9), he must pass through (6,9), (7,9).\nI am at (6,8) (if I move LEFT).\nIf he moves to (6,9), I am at (6,8).\nWe are adjacent vertically.\nNext turn, if I move UP to (6,9) and he moves UP to (6,10) (die) or something...\nThis is getting complex.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nI have 6. He has 4.\nI am winning.\nThe safest win is to eat more apples and reach 30, or survive to the end with more apples.\nBut the prompt says \"Be aggressive\" and \"Box him in\".\nMaybe I should just take the safe route (UP/RIGHT) and secure my lead.\nBut the \"archrival\" context suggests I should hunt him.\n\nLet's look at the board one more time.\nEnemy Body: (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5).\nThis is a vertical line on x=4.\nEnemy Head: (5,8).\nSo the tail is at (4,5).\nHe has a long body.\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), his tail moves from (4,5) to (4,6)?\nWait, if he doesn't eat, his tail moves forward.\nCurrent: Head(5,8) -> (4,8) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (4,5).\nIf he moves UP to (5,9): New Head (5,9). New Body: (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6). Tail (4,5) is released.\nSo the cell (4,5) becomes empty.\nThis opens up space behind him.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8):\nI am at (6,8).\nHe is at (5,8).\nIf he moves UP (5,9):\nNext turn, he is at (5,9). Body at (5,8), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6).\nI am at (6,8). Body follows.\nIf he moves UP again to (5,10) (die).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,9):\nIf I am at (6,8), he moves to (6,9). We are adjacent.\nIf I move UP to (6,9) next turn, and he moves to (6,10) (die) or (7,9), we might collide.\n\nActually, let's look at the \"Box him in\" again.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am occupying (6,8).\nHis only safe moves are UP (5,9) or DOWN (5,7).\nIf he moves UP, he enters the top row.\nIf I follow him UP, I can trap him in the corner.\nTop row: (0,9) to (9,9).\nApples at (1,9), (8,9), (9,9).\n(5,9) is relatively open.\nIf he goes to (5,9), he can go to (4,9), (3,9)... towards (1,9).\nOr Right towards (8,9).\n\nIf I move UP to (7,9):\nI am on the top row.\nI am closer to (8,9) and (9,9).\nI can secure the apples on the right.\nIf he moves UP to (5,9), he is on the top row too.\nIf he goes for (1,9), he is moving away from me.\nIf he goes for (8,9), he comes towards me.\nIf I secure (8,9) and (9,9), I grow bigger.\nThen I can hunt him later.\n\nHowever, the prompt says \"Box him in and make him crash out\".\nThis sounds like I should not let him roam free.\nIf I go UP to (7,9) and take the right side apples, he has the left side apples (1,9).\nHe can eat (1,9).\nHe can also eat (2,0), (7,0), (9,0) if he goes down.\nHe is at y=8. Bottom is far.\nTop is close.\nHe will likely go for (1,9) or (8,9).\nIf he goes for (1,9), he is safe.\nIf he goes for (8,9), he comes to me.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I am directly challenging him.\nI am forcing him to react to me.\nThis fits the \"aggressive\" and \"archrival\" vibe.\n\"Make him crash out\".\nIf I push him, he might panic and crash into his own tail or the wall.\nHis tail is at (4,5). He has length 5.\nIf he moves into his own tail (if it doesn't move out of the way), he dies.\nBut the tail moves every turn (unless he eats).\nSo he is safe from his tail unless he turns sharply.\n\nLet's consider the specific move LEFT to (6,8).\nIf I move LEFT, and he moves UP/DOWN, we don't crash.\nBut I have closed the gap.\nIf I don't move LEFT, and he moves UP, I am at (7,8) or (7,9).\nHe is at (5,9).\nThe distance is larger.\n\nThe prompt asks to \"Box him in\".\nBoxing him in means limiting his movement.\nLeft side is x=0 to x=4.\nIf I move to x=6, I am not boxing him in. x=5 is still open.\nTo box him in, I need to be at x=5.\nI am at x=7.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am at x=6.\nHe is at x=5.\nIf I want to box him in, I should probably move LEFT again next turn to (5,8).\nBut (5,8) is currently occupied by him.\nIf I move to (5,8) and he moves away, fine.\nIf I move to (5,8) and he stays (impossible), crash.\nIf I move to (5,8) and he moves to (5,8) (from somewhere else), crash.\n\nLet's assume he moves UP to (5,9).\nI am at (6,8).\nNext turn, I move UP to (6,9).\nHe is at (5,9).\nWe are adjacent.\nHe is boxed in on the left (x=0..5).\nI control x=6..9.\nThis is a good plan.\n\nSo, move LEFT to (6,8) seems consistent with \"Box him in\".\nIs it safe?\nEnemy at (5,8).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,8), we crash. I win (6 > 4).\nSo this is a GOOD outcome for me.\nIf he moves UP (5,9) or DOWN (5,7), we don't crash, and I am closer to him to continue boxing him in next turn.\n\nIs there any other threat?\nMy body is at (7,7), (8,7), etc.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am moving away from my body.\nMy tail is at (6,5).\n(6,8) is safe from my body.\n(6,8) is not adjacent to my body in a way that limits me immediately.\n\nWhat about the apple at (7,9)?\nI should probably eat it eventually.\nBut if I go LEFT now, I leave it.\nIf I go UP now, I can get it.\nBut the prompt prioritizes boxing the enemy over the apples (\"Focus on where the enemy is\").\nSo, boxing the enemy is the primary objective.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I am making a move towards the enemy.\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I am moving away from the enemy.\n\"Box him in\" implies moving towards him to restrict him.\n\nLet's double check the \"Box him in\" constraint.\nIf I move LEFT, I am at (6,8).\nIf he moves UP to (5,9).\nNext turn, I can move UP to (6,9).\nHe is at (5,9).\nHe is now in the top row corner (x=0..5, y=9).\nHe has apples at (1,9).\nI have apples at (8,9), (9,9).\nI can let him have (1,9).\nI will take the right side.\nThis seems like a valid \"boxing in\" strategy.\n\nSo, LEFT to (6,8) seems to be the most \"archrival\" move.\nIt forces a confrontation or a tactical positioning.\nIt also offers a chance for an instant win if he moves into me.\n\nLet's check if there are any other dangers.\nIs there an apple at (6,8)? No.\nIs there an apple at (7,8)? No (I just ate it? Wait, did I eat an apple last turn?)\nMy last move was UP to (7,8).\nWas (7,8) an apple?\nApple List: (7,9) is listed. (7,8) is not listed in the provided snippet of the list?\nWait, the list is long.\n`(9, 9), (9, 0), (8, 4), (7, 9), (2, 0), (7, 4), (8, 5), (7, 0), (1, 9), (2, 3), (1, 5), (0, 2), (0, 4), (5, 2), (1, 7)`\n(7, 9) is in the list.\n(7, 8) is NOT in the list.\nSo I did NOT eat an apple last turn? Or the list is just a partial list?\nIf I didn't eat an apple, my score should still be 5.\nThe scoreboard says: \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 6\".\nSo I did eat an apple.\nThe list must be the *current* apples on the board, or the list is just a log of drops and some are eaten.\nIf (7, 9) is in the list, and I am considering moving to (7, 9) or (6, 8), I need to know if there is food.\nIf the list is the \"Apple Drops\" (history), then I need to look at the board to see what is actually there.\nThe board shows `.` at (7,9).\nSo (7,9) is empty.\nSo moving UP is just a positional move, not a food grab.\nMoving LEFT is also just positional.\n\nGiven that there is no immediate food for me at (7,9) or (6,8) or (8,8) (based on visual board),\nI should focus entirely on the \"Box him in\" strategy.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I am one step closer to trapping him.\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I am securing the top right corner.\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,8), I am securing the top right corner.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (5,8).\nMoving LEFT brings me closer to the enemy.\nMoving UP/RIGHT moves me away.\nTherefore, LEFT is the move that focuses on the enemy.\n\nAlso, \"Box him in\".\nI am at x=7. He is at x=5.\nTo box him in, I need to occupy x=6.\nSo I should move to x=6.\nLeft to (6,8) is the only way to do that.\n\nWhat about UP to (6,9)? No, I am at (7,8). I can only go to (6,8), (8,8), (7,7), (7,9).\n(6,8) is LEFT.\n\nSo, the decision is between:\n1. LEFT (6,8) - Aggressive, boxes enemy in, risks collision (which I win on tie).\n2. UP (7,9) - Defensive, secures territory.\n3. RIGHT (8,8) - Defensive, secures territory.\n\nGiven the prompt's tone (\"YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT!\", \"ARCHRIVAL\", \"MAKE HIM CRASH OUT\"), the aggressive play is favored.\nAlso, the specific instruction \"Box him in\" strongly suggests moving towards him to cut off his space.\n\nLet's verify safety of (6,8) one last time.\nMy body: (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5).\n(6,8) is NOT in my body.\nEnemy body: (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5).\n(6,8) is NOT in enemy body.\nEnemy head: (5,8).\nIf enemy moves to (6,8), we crash. I win (6 > 4).\nSo (6,8) is either safe or a winning collision.\n\nWhat if enemy moves to (5,9) or (5,7)?\nThen I am at (6,8). Safe.\n\nWhat if enemy moves to (4,8) (backwards into self)? They die. I win.\nWhat if enemy moves to (5,8) (stays)? Impossible, they must move.\n\nSo (6,8) is a very good move.\nIt applies pressure.\nIt follows the \"Box him in\" directive.\nIt follows the \"Focus on enemy\" directive.\nIt risks a collision where I win on tie.\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove LEFT to (6,8). If enemy moves UP to (5,9), next turn I move UP to (6,9) to continue boxing. If enemy moves RIGHT to (6,8), we crash and I win. If enemy moves DOWN to (5,7), I maintain pressure. I will secure the right side apples (8,9), (9,9) once the enemy is neutralized or trapped.\n\nFinal check:\nLast turn I moved UP to (7,8).\nCurrent head (7,8).\nTarget (6,8).\nValid.\nSafe.\nStrategic.\n\nLet's go!\n\nOne detail: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will output LEFT.",

We are winning, so we control the tempo.\n\n**The Board:**\n- **Enemy:** Trapped on the left side. His head is `(5, 8)`. His body blocks `(4, 8)`, `(4, 7)`, `(4, 6)`. The wall is at `x=0`.\n- **Me:** Sitting at `(7, 8)`. My body is trailing down and right.\n- **The Zone:** The area between `x=5` (Enemy Head) and `x=7` (My Head) is the kill box.\n\n**The Moves:**\n1.  **DOWN to `(7, 7)`:** **DEAD.** That's my own body. Never look back.\n2.  **UP to `(7, 9)`:** Safe? Yes. But does it press the enemy? No. It moves me to the wall. It gives him space to breathe at `(5, 8)` or `(5, 9)`. We want to squeeze, not give him breathing room.\n3.  **RIGHT to `(8, 8)`:** Safe. Moves me away from him. This is a retreat. We are not retreating with a score of 6 to 4. We are pushing.\n4.  **LEFT to `(6, 8)`:** **THE MURDER MOVE.** \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\n**The Logic:**\nIf I go **LEFT** to `(6, 8)`, I am stepping directly into the space between us.\n- **Risk:** If he goes **RIGHT** to `(6, 8)`, we collide. Head-on. Double death.\n- **Why I Win the Risk:** He has 4 apples. I have 6. If we both die, **HE LOSES** because I have the higher score.\n- **Reality:** He sees my score. He knows I'm winning. If he's smart, he won't crash into me because it guarantees his loss (or at least a draw, which isn't a win for him). He will likely panic and move UP to `(5, 9)` or Down to `(5, 7)`.\n\nBy moving **LEFT**, I am physically boxing him in. I am taking the square `(6, 8)` which cuts off his rightward escape. I am forcing him to react to *my* position.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1.  Move **LEFT** to `(6, 8)` to apply maximum pressure.\n2.  If he moves UP `(5, 9)`, next turn I go UP to `(6, 9)` to block him from the top row apples.\n3.  If he moves DOWN `(5, 7)`, I maintain the horizontal barrier and hunt the right-side apples `(8, 9)`, `(9, 9)`.\n4.  If he commits suicide by moving RIGHT into me, I win on the tie-breaker.\n\nLET'S MAKE HIM CRASH OUT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",
