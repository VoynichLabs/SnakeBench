Our closest apple is at (0,7); from our head at (1,4) the Manhattan distance is |1\u20130|+|4\u20137| = 1+3 = 4.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at our safe options:\n\n1. If we move LEFT, our head will go to (0,4). From there the distance to (0,7) becomes |0\u20130| + |4\u20137| = 3, and we immediately reduce the horizontal gap.\n2. If we move UP, our head moves to (1,5). Then the Manhattan distance to (0,7) is |1\u20130| + |5\u20137| = 1+2 = 3, which is equally good for closing the gap\u2014but our horizontal gap remains, meaning we\u2019ll have to make a leftward move on a later turn.\n3. Moving DOWN or RIGHT either increases the distance or causes a collision (RIGHT would hit our body, and DOWN isn\u2019t moving us closer to the target apple).\n\nBoth LEFT and UP appear safe and yield the same reduced distance. The advantage of going LEFT is that it immediately brings our head into the 0\u2011column, directly aligning us horizontally with the apple at (0,7). Being closer on the x\u2011axis allows us to then focus on moving upward to reach the apple in subsequent moves, and we stay clear of the enemy\u2019s territory.\n\nThus, based on safety and efficient progress toward our target apple, the best next move is:\n\nLEFT."

(Remember that moving into any of these cells is deadly!)\n\u2022 Looking at the board, row 4 is almost completely blocked by obstacles (namely the enemy snake\u2019s body from (3,4) to (9,4) and possibly our previous segments), except for a few open cells. In fact, the only clear gaps on that barrier are in the left region \u2013 around (1,4) and (2,4). We want to head into one of those gaps so we can descend into the region with many apples.\n\u2022 Examining the options from (2,5):\n\u2003\u2013 Moving UP to (2,6) would run into our own body.\n\u2003\u2013 Moving RIGHT to (3,5) would shift us away from the gap.\n\u2003\u2013 Moving LEFT to (1,5) is safe but moves us off our current alignment with the gap at (2,4). (We could head toward (1,4) eventually, but staying in column 2 keeps our downward route more direct.)\n\u2003\u2013 Moving DOWN to (2,4) is safe (row 4, column 2 is open) and keeps us well aligned with the intended passage.\n\u2022 Also, the enemy snake is operating on the right half of the board, so keeping to the left side by descending is a safer strategy.\n\nIn summary, by moving DOWN from (2,5) to (2,4) we remain on course to enter the gap that opens a path to the apple-rich lower area. My strategy for the next turn is to continue this downward progress and, if needed, later consider slight adjustments (e.g., LEFT toward (1,4)) depending on the evolving board state.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

This extra flexibility is valuable as it will let us adapt our route toward the accessible apples.\n\nGiven these considerations, from (1,7) the best move is to go DOWN. \n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

However, compared to the move DOWN, it slightly reduces our ability to later grab the left\u2010side apple cluster.\n\nGiven that our snake\u2019s body is arranged mostly upward and to the right, and the apple cluster on the left (at (0,5), (0,4), and (0,2)) looks promising for further growth, the most flexible and safe approach is to move DOWN from our head at (1,6) to (1,5).\n\nAt (1,5) we can then choose between going LEFT (for apple at (0,5)) or RIGHT (for apple at (2,5)), keeping our options wide open.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

From (0,5), our safe moves would be UP to (0,6) (which is free) or DOWN to (0,4) where another apple lies. Although being at the left edge means one less escape direction, the availability of a chain of apples on column 0 makes it very promising.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (2,5): This is also an apple, but after moving there our options become more restrictive. Our body occupies (3,5) so turning further right is blocked, and returning left would make us run into ourselves. That move would steer us away from the denser apple cluster on the left.\n\n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (1,4): An empty cell that keeps options open but doesn\u2019t take the immediate apple.
