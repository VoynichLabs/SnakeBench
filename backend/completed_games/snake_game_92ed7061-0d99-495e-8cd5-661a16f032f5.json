There are 5 apples on the board at various positions.\n\nFor my next move, I need to consider the safe options:\n- UP: Move to (4, 3) - gets me closer to apples at (2, 3), (3, 3), and (0, 3)\n- DOWN: Move to (4, 1) - gets me closer to apple at (0, 2)\n- LEFT: Move to (3, 2) - gets me closer to apples at (2, 3), (3, 3), and (0, 2)\n- RIGHT: Move to (5, 2) - moves back to previous position\n\nAll directions are safe as they keep me within bounds and away from the enemy's current position. The enemy is likely to move DOWN to (4, 6) or LEFT to (3, 7) to approach the apple at (0, 7), so I should move in a direction that keeps me safe while positioning me well for future apple collection.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 3) seems optimal as it positions me directly adjacent to the cluster of apples at (2, 3), (3, 3), and (0, 3). This move gets me closer to multiple apples while maintaining flexibility for the next few turns. It also keeps me away from the enemy's likely path.\n\nUP<|end_of_box|>",

The enemy from (2,6) has safe options Up(2,7) or Right(3,6). If they go Up into (2,7), that cell is now part of my new body after the move, which would cause them to collide with my body and die.

DOWN keeps more breathing room and avoids edge clutter, so it\u2019s a solid choice.\n\nPlan note:\n- Move toward open space while eyeing near-term apples when safe. Prioritize not getting boxed by the enemy or into a dead end. If a clear, safe path to an apple appears (e.g., (2,2), (3,1), or (0,0)) without risking self or enemy traps, pursue it. Otherwise, maintain flexibility by not pinning against the edge and keep options available for the next turns.\n\nDOWN",

There's no apple at this position, but it moves me away from the enemy snake and closer to the apple at (1, 4) which is 1 cell away (up 2).\n\n4.

The enemy snake's body extends downward to (2, 3), (3, 3), etc., so moving LEFT creates more distance from the enemy.\n\nI'll choose LEFT as it provides better positioning for future apple collection while maintaining safety from the enemy snake.<|end_of_box|>\nLEFT",
