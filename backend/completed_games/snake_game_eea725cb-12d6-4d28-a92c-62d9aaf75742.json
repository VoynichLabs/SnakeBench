Keeps me in play. Moves me slightly north. This opens up options to go toward the center or chase apples later.\n2. **DOWN (6,0)** - Safe. On the board. Moves me to the bottom row. But this might limit my future movement (dead end risk).\n3. **LEFT (5,1)** - Safe. Moves me left toward (5,1) which is actually an apple! \ud83c\udf4e This is aggressive positioning to get in #0's potential path.\n4. **RIGHT (7,1)** - Safe. Moves me right toward the center. Good central control.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n- LEFT to (5,1) hits an apple AND puts me on the board's mid-section. More importantly, I want to push northward to pressure #0. But wait - let me reconsider.\n- UP to (6,2) gives me central positioning and keeps my options open. From there I can go anywhere.\n- LEFT gets me an apple NOW but puts me at (5,1) - not central.\n\nActually, I want to set up a trap! Let me go UP to get toward the center and be ready to cut off #0's escape if they go down or left.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Future Self:**\nPush north toward the center (7-9 range) to cut off snake #0's escape routes. They're cornered at (9,9) - force them down or left into our kill zone. Once we're central, we can sweep the board for apples while they panic.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nGoing UP to (6,2) - central positioning for the trap! \n\nUP",

Who's ready to rumble? \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick situational read (thinking out loud, per the playbook):\n- My head = (9,9) \u2014 corner. Moves off the board: UP (y=10) and RIGHT (x=10) = insta-death. No thanks. \u274c\n- SAFE moves: LEFT -> (8,9), DOWN -> (9,8). \u2705\u2705\n- Opponent is at (6,1) \u2014 far away for now, so no immediate head-on threat. Distance will drop from 11 \u2192 10 whichever safe move we pick.\n- Apples near us: (7,9) is left from (8,9). (9,7) is down from (9,8). Both give quick growth next turn if we follow up.\n\nReasoning / choice:\n- LEFT to (8,9) gives a very clean follow-up: LEFT again to grab (7,9) immediately. That gets us growth and moves us off the cramped right edge into more central top space \u2014 more escape routes and better boxing potential. \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udd12\n- DOWN to (9,8) also gets to an apple next turn (9,7), but keeps us hugging the right wall which reduces options. We want to maximize future branching so we can trap the rival later. \ud83e\udde0\n- No risk of head-on this turn (opponent is far). We will NOT force a collision while tied on apples \u2014 that's a draw risk. We want to grow and build positional advantage first. \u2696\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Next turn: LEFT again to eat (7,9) and grow. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Then sweep left and begin descending toward the mid/top area to control lanes (use length to form a wall). Force the opponent into tighter space and cut off escape routes. If we get ahead on apples, consider forcing head-on when favorable. \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\ude93\n\nFinal move (right now): LEFT\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're live and ready to box in snake #0! Turn 1/150, let's break this down!\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Snake #0 is at (8,9) - top-right corner, but wait, the board shows '0' at (9,9)? Let me check the board state again.\n- Board row 9: \"9 . . . . . . . A 0 .\" - so '0' is at column 8? Actually, looking at the coordinates: columns 0-9, so (8,9) would be column 8 row 9? Let me parse: the board shows positions. From the top-left (9,0) to (9,9)? Wait, the coordinates are from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So the board representation: row 9 is top row, row 0 is bottom row. Column 0 is left, column 9 is right. So in row 9 (top), we have columns 0-9. The string is \"9 . . . . . . . A 0 .\" So column 0: '.', column1: '.', ..., column7: '.', column8: 'A', column9: '0'? Wait, that's 10 characters? Let's count: \"9\" then space? Actually the board line is: \"9 . . . . . . . A 0 .\" That's 11 characters if including the initial \"9 \"? Let's assume the initial \"9 \" is just the row label, then the actual cells are the 10 symbols: positions 0-9: 0: ., 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: A, 9: 0. So snake #0 is at (9,9) (top-right corner). Yes, because column 9 is rightmost, row 9 is topmost. Good.\n- So snake #0 is at (9,9), cornered. No body.\n- My snake is at (6,2) with no body.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n- I'm at (6,2). I moved UP last turn from (6,1) to (6,2). Good.\n- Apples are many, but we focus on enemy.\n- Goal: cut off #0's escape routes. They can move LEFT to (8,9) or DOWN to (9,8). They can't move RIGHT (off board) or UP (off board). So they have two safe moves.\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n- UP: (6,3) - safe, moves toward center, keeps options open.\n- DOWN: (6,1) - safe, but moving back to where I was? Could be okay but not advancing.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - safe, moves left, closer to center-left.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - safe, moves right, toward center.\n\nWhich move puts me in a position to cut off #0's escape? I want to head north or northeast to intercept if #0 goes down or left. From (6,2), moving UP to (6,3) gets me closer to row 9? Actually, distance to (9,9): from (6,2) to (9,9) is \u0394x=3, \u0394y=7. If I go UP to (6,3), \u0394y reduces to 6, good. If I go RIGHT to (7,2), \u0394x reduces to 2, \u0394y still 7. Actually, I want to be between #0 and the center. #0 is at corner, if they go LEFT to (8,9), I could go RIGHT to intercept? Let's think strategically.\n\nI need to force #0 into a trap. They have limited moves. If I go UP, I can later go RIGHT to get closer to (9,9). But I also want to avoid being too close to their body? They have no body yet.\n\nLet's consider each move for safety and future options:\n- UP: safe, from (6,3) I have 3 possible moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) except if I'm on edge? No, (6,3) is center, 4 moves. Good.\n- DOWN: safe, but (6,1) is near bottom? Row 1, so still 4 moves? Actually row 1: I can go DOWN to row 0, still safe. But moving down doesn't help intercept #0.\n- LEFT: (5,2) safe, central.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) safe, central.\n\nAll are safe. I need to choose one that advances my plan. I want to push toward the top-right quadrant to cut off #0. So moving RIGHT or UP? Let's see: from (6,2), if I go RIGHT, I'm at (7,2). Then next turn I can go UP to (7,3) etc. If I go UP now, I'm at (6,3). Then next turn I can go RIGHT to (7,3). Both similar.\n\nBut also, I should consider apples. There's an apple at (8,5) and (5,1) etc. But focus on enemy. However, eating apples grows my body, which helps in forcing head-on collisions if I'm bigger.\n\nApple at (5,1) is left and down from me. Apple at (6,0) is down from me. Apple at (5,4) up-left. Apple at (7,5) right-up. Many options.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to (7,2) to move toward the right side, putting me on the column closer to snake #0's column (9). This sets up a path to intercept.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move rightward and upward to position myself between snake #0 and the center. Force them to choose between moving left (into my path) or down (which I can chase). Once I'm at (8,3) or similar, I can block their left escape. Then sweep for apples to grow while they panic.\n\n**Final Decision:** Going RIGHT to (7,2) - aggressive positioning!\n\nRIGHT",

Time to box them in and force a crash! \n\n**Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is cornered at (9,9) - only two safe moves for them: LEFT to (8,9) or DOWN to (9,8). Their body is empty. They might try to flee or grab the apple at (8,8) if it's still there? Wait, the board shows row 8 has 'A A' at columns 8 and 9? Actually, row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . A A .\" so (8,8) and (9,8) are apples? Let me parse: row 8, columns 0-9: . . . . . . . A A ., so (7,8)=A, (8,8)=A, (9,8)=. Wait, the string says \"A A .\" so after three dots, there's A at col7, A at col8, and . at col9? That would be (7,8)=A, (8,8)=A, (9,8)=. Hmm, but the apple list includes (8,8)? Not in the list, but (8,5) etc. Anyway, not important. The key is snake #0 is trapped and I want to cut off their escape routes.\n\n**My Position:** At (6,2), after moving RIGHT last turn. I have no body, so no self-collision risk. All moves are safe from board edges and bodies.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP to (6,3):** Safe. Moves me closer to the top where #0 is. Increases my y, good for intercepting if they go DOWN. 4 follow-up options.\n- **DOWN to (6,1):** Safe. Moves me back toward bottom, losing ground on #0. Only 3 follow-up? Actually row 1 has DOWN to row 0, so still 4 options, but not aggressive.\n- **LEFT to (5,2):** Safe. Moves left, away from #0. Not ideal for cutting them off.\n- **RIGHT to (7,2):** Safe. Moves right, toward #0's column. Increases x, good for positioning to block their LEFT escape. 4 follow-up options.\n\n**Aggression & Strategy:** I need to push towards the top-right. My score is 0 vs their 1, so I need to eat apples to grow. But first, position to dominate. Going RIGHT now puts me at (7,2), then next turn I can go RIGHT again to (8,2) or UP to (7,3), getting closer to (9,9). This cuts off #0's LEFT path (to (8,9)) by positioning me on column 7-8. If they go DOWN to (9,8), I can chase and maybe head-on if I'm bigger later.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** From (7,2), next turn aim for (8,2) or (7,3) to close in on #0's corner. Then sweep for apples (like (7,5) or (8,5)) to grow while trapping them. Force them to panic and crash into me!\n\n**Final Decision:** RIGHT is the move \u2013 aggressive, positioning, and opens up more escape routes for me. Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

Grabbing the apple below does two things: increases our apple lead (now 2-0) and pushes us down the same column as the opponent so we can pressure and funnel him. Also keeps multiple follow-up options (we can continue down the column or branch left/right from mid-board).\n\nRisks:\n- Moving DOWN will block our immediate UP return (our body will occupy 7,9), so avoid getting trapped against walls on future turns. Plan movement accordingly.\n- Opponent is far; no immediate head-on this turn. But with +1 apple we can more confidently try to force collisions later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be my last rationale next time):\n- Eat (7,8) now to grow and increase lead \u2192 2-0.\n- Then push down the 7-column, using our length to cut lanes and shepherd the opponent toward the board edge or apples we control.\n- If opponent starts moving up into us and we have the apple advantage, bait a head-on to take him out. If he evades, continue boxing by sweeping horizontally and descending to trap him.\n\nFinal move \u2014 go get the apple, secure the lead, and start the funnel. Ready to clamp down?

No immediate death.  \n\n**STEP 2: EVALUATE SAFE MOVES FOR STRATEGY**  \n* **UP (8,3)**: Toward top-right where enemy is. Keeps me near apples (5,4), (3,4), (4,4). 4 follow-up options.  \n* **DOWN (8,1)**: Back toward bottom, away from enemy.

Limits follow-ups (only 3: LEFT, UP, DOWN). Risky long-term, but gets me closer to column 9 where enemy is cornered.  \n\n**STEP 3: AGGRESSION & BOARD CONTROL**  \nEnemy is trapped at (7,8) with body [(7,9), (8,9)] \u2013 they\u2019ll likely move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8) to escape.

From there, I can chase enemy or grab apples like (7,5) or (5,4).  \n- My score is 0 vs their 2 \u2013 I need apples to grow and force a head-on collision. (8,3) is adjacent to apple (7,5) via path (8,3)->(8,4)->(8,5)->(7,5). Also near (5,4).  \n\n**STEP 4: LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n1. Move UP to (8,3) \u2013 secure position near center.  \n2.

Wait, the description says: \"Snake #0 - Head: (6,8), Body: [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)]\". Actually, the head is (6,8), body is (7,8), (7,9), (8,9). But the board shows: row 8 has \"0 T .\"? Wait, the board visualization shows row 9: \" . . . . . . . T T .\" and row 8: \" . . . . . . 0 T . .\" So column 6 on row 8 is '0' (head), column 7 is 'T' (body), column 8 is 'T' (body). Row 9 column 7 and 8 are 'T' (body). So enemy body includes (7,8), (8,8?) Actually from board: row8 col7 = T, row8 col8 = T? Wait row8 string: \" . . . . . . 0 T . .\" That's positions: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '0', col7 'T', col8 '.', col9 '.'? Wait, the string length is 10 characters, but there are spaces? The representation: \"9 . . . . . . . T T .\" that's 10 tokens? Let's parse: Actually the board is drawn with spaces, but the line: \"9 . . . . . . . T T .\" means row 9, columns 0-9: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '.', col7 'T', col8 'T', col9 '.'? That's 10 tokens: ., ., ., ., ., ., ., T, T, . (so 10 columns). Similarly row 8: \"8 . . . . . . 0 T . .\" -> tokens: ., ., ., ., ., ., 0, T, ., .? That's 10: col0 '.', col1 '.', col2 '.', col3 '.', col4 '.', col5 '.', col6 '0', col7 'T', col8 '.', col9 '.'. So enemy head is (6,8) (col6, row8). Body: (7,8) is 'T', (8,8) is '.'? Actually row8 col8 is '.', so not body. Wait, the description says body [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)]. Let's check row7: \"7 . . . . . . . . . A\" -> col7 '.', col8 '.', col9 'A'. So (7,8) is '.'? But the board shows row7 all '.' except col9 'A'. So (7,8) is not 'T'. There's inconsistency. Let's rely on the textual description: \"Snake #0 - Head: (6,8), Body: [(7,8), (7,9), (8,9)]\". That means body occupies those three coordinates. So (7,8) is body, (7,9) is body, (8,9) is body. That matches row9 col7 and col8 being 'T', and row8 col9 being '.'? Actually row8 col9 is '.' from the board drawing. But according to body, (8,9) is body. So maybe the board drawing is approximate. I'll trust the textual snake lists: opponent body includes (7,8), (7,9), (8,9). So that's important.\n\nNow evaluate moves from (8,3):\n\n- UP: (8,4). Is that inside board? Yes. Check if it's occupied by any snake body. My body: none. Opponent body: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9). (8,4) is not in that list. Also not my own head or body. So safe from collision. Also not wall. So UP is safe.\n\n- DOWN: (8,2). That's where I came from? My head was at (8,2) last turn? Actually last turn I moved UP from (8,2) to (8,3). So (8,2) is now empty (since my body is none). So moving DOWN would go back to (8,2). That's allowed? The rules say: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" But my body is empty, so there's no body segment behind my head. So moving DOWN is safe. However, note: after moving UP, my previous head position becomes part of my body? Actually in Snake, when you move, your tail moves? In this game, snakes grow when they eat apples. Here, I have 0 apples, so my length is 1 (just head). When I move, my head moves, and since I didn't eat, my tail also moves? In traditional Snake, the tail moves forward so length stays same. But in this game, do snakes have a tail that moves? The description: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\" So if I have no body, my list is just [head]. When I move, if I don't eat, my head moves to new cell, and my body list becomes [new head]? Actually the tail would disappear? The length stays 1. So my previous head cell becomes empty. So moving DOWN to (8,2) is safe.\n\n- LEFT: (7,3). Check occupancy: not in opponent body (which is (7,8),(7,9),(8,9)). Not my body. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (9,3). Check: is (9,3) occupied? Not by opponent body. Not my body. Also within board (x=9 is valid). Safe.\n\nSo all four moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**STEP 2: STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS**\nMy score: 0 apples. Opponent: 3 apples. I'm behind. I need to grow quickly to have a chance to force a head-on collision later.\n\nApple positions: many on board. Nearby apples: From (8,3), I can see (7,5) is two steps away (right and up? Actually (8,3) to (7,5): need to go LEFT to (7,3) then UP twice? Not adjacent. (5,4) is somewhat close. But I should consider which moves get me closer to apples while keeping future mobility.\n\nLet's evaluate each move's potential:\n\n- UP to (8,4): This moves me upward toward the top where opponent is located (around row8-9). From (8,4), I have many safe moves: UP to (8,5) which has an apple? Apple list includes (8,5) yes! Actually apple list: (8,5) is listed. So moving UP to (8,4) puts me adjacent to apple at (8,5) for next turn if I go UP again. Also from (8,4) I can go LEFT to (7,4) (safe), RIGHT to (9,4) (edge), DOWN back to (8,3). So 4 options except maybe RIGHT is edge but still 3 options. Good mobility.\n\n- DOWN to (8,2): Moves me back to previous spot. From there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP (back to 8,3), DOWN to (8,1). That's also 4 options. But this moves me away from opponent and apples. Not aggressive.\n\n- LEFT to (7,3): Moves toward center-left. From there, I can go UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3). 4 options. Also closer to apple at (5,4) maybe? But not directly.\n\n- RIGHT to (9,3): Moves to right edge. From there, options: UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3). Only 3 options. Also (9,3) is near column 9 where opponent has body at (8,9) and (7,9). But that's far vertically. This move reduces future mobility.\n\n**STEP 3: AGGRESSION & BOARD CONTROL**\nEnemy is at (6,8) with body stretching to (7,8),(7,9),(8,9). They are near the top-right corner. They likely want to escape to the left or down. My goal is to cut off their escape routes and eventually force a collision when I have more length.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,4), I position myself to move further up to (8,5) and (8,6) etc., potentially approaching the top-right region. Also, from (8,4) I can go RIGHT to (9,4) and then UP to (9,5) etc., but that might trap me on edge.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,3) keeps me more central and gives access to many apples: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), etc. I could grow quickly there.\n\nBut note: opponent has 3 apples already, I have 0. I need apples. Which direction has more apples? Looking at apple list: (8,5) is directly above if I go UP. (7,5) is also nearby. (5,4) is left-up. (4,4) left. (3,4) left. (4,2) down-left. So center-left has many apples.\n\nHowever, I must also consider enemy movement. If I go LEFT, I move away from enemy, but that might be okay if I plan to circle back.\n\nBut the stream vibe is aggressive: \"box him in and make him crash out\". So maybe I should move toward him. UP moves me closer to his territory.\n\nLet's think about potential head-on collisions. If I move UP to (8,4) and he moves DOWN from (6,8) to (6,7) or something, we're still far. I need to get closer.\n\nMaybe I should consider that I can force him into a corner. He's already near top-right corner. If I move RIGHT to (9,3), I could eventually block his left escape along row 9? But (9,3) is low.\n\nActually, if I move UP to (8,4), then next turn I could go RIGHT to (9,4) and then UP to (9,5) etc., approaching his body from the right side. That might cut off his escape to the right.\n\nBut let's examine board more carefully. The opponent body includes (8,9) and (7,9). So column 9 is blocked at rows 7-8. If he tries to go RIGHT to (7,9) or (8,9), he'd hit his own body? Actually his head is at (6,8). He could move RIGHT to (7,8) but that's his own body (since body includes (7,8)). So he cannot move into his own body. So his possible moves from (6,8): UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) but (7,8) is his body, so that's illegal (he'd die). So he has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. UP to (6,9) is within board? y=9 is top row, yes. DOWN to (6,7) is safe. LEFT to (5,8) safe.\n\nSo he likely will go LEFT or DOWN to escape.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,4), I am not directly blocking those paths. But if I later move to (6,7) or (5,8), I could intercept.\n\nMaybe moving LEFT to (7,3) is better to head toward the center where I can grow quickly and then chase.\n\nBut the chat wants aggression. Let's see apple at (8,5). If I move UP now to (8,4), next turn I can go UP to (8,5) and eat that apple, growing to length 2. That would give me a point and more length. Then I have a body segment behind me, which could be used to trap the enemy later.\n\nAlso, from (8,5), I can go LEFT to (7,5) which also has an apple? Apple list includes (7,5). Yes. So I could eat two apples quickly.\n\nSo UP seems promising for rapid growth.\n\nBut what about mobility? From (8,4), I still have 4 safe moves. From (8,5) after eating, I'll have length 2. My tail will be at (8,4) after moving? Actually if I eat at (8,5), I grow, so my tail stays at (8,3) maybe? Let's simulate: Start at (8,3). Move UP to (8,4). No apple there. So after move, my head is (8,4), body empty? Since I didn't eat, length remains 1. So no tail. Next turn, if I move UP to (8,5) and there's an apple, I eat, so length becomes 2. My head becomes (8,5), and my body becomes [(8,4)] (previous head). So then I have a body segment. That could be a risk if I backtrack.\n\nBut that's manageable.\n\n**STEP 4: LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. Move UP to (8,4) to position for apple at (8,5).\n2. Next turn, move UP to (8,5) to eat apple, growing to length 2.\n3. Then assess enemy movement. If enemy moved LEFT, I could chase via (7,5) and (6,5) etc.\n4. Collect additional apples in the area: (7,5), (5,4), (4,4) to grow faster.\n5. Once I have equal or more length than enemy, force confrontation.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP\nIt's aggressive, gets me closer to apples and enemy territory, and maintains good mobility.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

The enemy snake #0 is holed up in the top-right corner with a length of 4 (head at (6,8), body stretching to (7,8), (7,9), (8,9)). They've got apples, but they're boxed in by their own tail and the wall. We need to press the advantage.\n\n**THINKING IT THROUGH:**\n\n1. **ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:**\n   - **DOWN (8,2):** Safe, but it's backtracking to where we just came from. We didn't eat an apple there, so it's empty. However, this moves us *away* from the action and the enemy. Not aggressive.\n   - **LEFT (7,3):** Safe. Moves us left towards the center of the board where there are plenty of apples (like (5,4) and (4,4)). Good for growth, but we're giving the enemy space.\n   - **RIGHT (9,3):** Safe. Moves us to the right edge. While this cuts off the enemy's potential escape to the right later, it puts us against the wall. Our mobility would be limited to UP and DOWN (and back LEFT). We don't want to trap ourselves early.\n   - **UP (8,4):** Safe. Moves us directly toward the enemy's general area and closer to two immediate apples: (8,5) and (7,5).\n\n2. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS & AGGRESSION:**\n   - The enemy is pinned. If they try to move RIGHT into (7,8) or UP into (6,9), they might run into their own body or the wall. They are likely to move LEFT or DOWN to survive.\n   - By moving UP to (8,4), I set up a kill zone.\n     - **Next turn (Turn 6):** I can go UP again to (8,5) and eat the apple there. This grows my length to 2.\n     - **The trap:** From (8,5), I can then move LEFT to (7,5) (another apple) or UP toward (8,6). This positions me perfectly to block the enemy's path if they try to slide down the right side or escape left.\n   - Moving UP keeps my mobility high (4 options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). It also aligns with the stream's vibe: **NO FEAR.** We box him in.\n\n3. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n   - Turn 6: Go UP to (8,5) \u2192 Eat apple (Length 2).\n   - Turn 7: Go LEFT to (7,5) \u2192 Eat apple (Length 3) OR go UP to (8,6) to cut off escape.\n   - Goal: Reach length 3+ quickly to match his size, then force a head-on collision or corner him against the wall. He has 3 apples; we need to catch up to have the score advantage for a forced collision.\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe are going **UP** to claim ground and prepare to eat. Let's grow and hunt!\n\nUP",

If they move LEFT, they hit (6,7). They can't hit me directly unless they pull a miracle. However, moving LEFT into (7,5) puts me adjacent to the enemy's head (7,7) and their body (6,7). This is aggressive, but I might get blocked if they move into my path.\n*   **RIGHT (9,5):** My current Y is 5, X is 8. Right is (9,5). Is this safe? The board edge is 9, so it's within bounds. No body there. Safe. But it's a dead end? No, I can go back LEFT, UP, or DOWN. It's a corner, but not a full trap yet.\n*   **DOWN (8,4):** I just came from here? Wait, my body is at (8,4). **CRITICAL CHECK:** Moving DOWN from (8,5) takes me to (8,4). That is my own body segment. **RULE VIOLATION:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **UP (8,6):** (8,6) is currently empty. No apple, no body. Safe.\n\n**2. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS & AGGRESSION:**\nThe enemy is at (7,7). They have 3 apples, we have 1. We need to grow and cut them off. They are trapped in the top right corner (positions (7,8), (8,9), etc.). They will likely try to move DOWN or LEFT to survive.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (7,5):** Grabs an apple. Increases score to 2. Length grows. This puts me directly in the \"lane\" next to the enemy (7,7). If they move DOWN to (7,6), we are side-by-side. If they move LEFT to (6,7), we are diagonally adjacent. This is high-pressure but potentially risky if they get aggressive.\n*   **Option UP (8,6):** Safe. Opens up the path to the top right. From (8,6), I can go LEFT to (7,6) or UP to (8,7) next turn. It positions me to block their potential escape route up the right wall. It keeps me mobile (I can retreat down to (8,5) or go right to (9,6)).\n*   **Option RIGHT (9,5):** Safe. Moves to the edge. Limits mobility to 3 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT). It's a \"safe\" spot, but it moves me away from the enemy's immediate vicinity. The enemy is at (7,7). I want to close the distance, not increase it.\n\n**3. LONG-TERM PLAN & KILL ZONE:**\nWe need to box them in. The enemy is at (7,7). Their body is at (6,7), (6,8), (7,8).\nMy current pos: (8,5).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (7,5) (Eating Apple!):\n*   I grow to length 2.\n*   I am now at (7,5).\n*   Next turn, I can go UP to (7,6). This cuts off their vertical escape down column 7.\n*   OR I can go RIGHT to (8,5) or DOWN to (7,4).\n*   **The Trap:** By taking (7,5), I control the center of the right side. The enemy cannot go below row 7 without hitting me if I position correctly.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am taking the **LEFT** move. Why?\n1.  **Growth:** I need apples to match their score (1 -> 2). (7,5) is an apple.\n2.  **Positioning:** It moves me closer to the enemy. Distance from (8,5) to (7,7) is sqrt(5). Distance from (7,5) to (7,7) is 2. I am closing the gap.\n3.  **Blocking:** By occupying (7,5), I am occupying the coordinate directly below their potential horizontal escape route. If they try to slide down column 7, I can step into (7,6) next.\n\n*Wait, let's double check the map.*\nEnemy at (7,7).\nMy move LEFT to (7,5).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (7,6): We are not colliding yet. We are one square apart vertically.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (6,7): We are far apart.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN, I can go UP next turn to (7,6) and force a collision or block.\nThis is the strongest move to assert dominance and grow.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nWe are going LEFT to eat the apple and prepare to cut off the snake!\n\nLEFT",

Keeps multiple follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). \u2705\n\nEnemy state: head at (8,5), neck at (8,4) so they CAN'T go DOWN. Their best immediate tempt is LEFT to (7,5) apple. They want that apple. We\u2019re up 3\u20131, so we should pressure and try to corral them into bad choices (or bait a head-on where we win the apple-count tie). Moving DOWN shrinks their vertical escape and sets us up to cut them off on the next turns.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (7,6) to close the Y-gap and threaten (7,5).\n- If they go for (7,5), follow and either force a contest for that apple or pivot RIGHT to block their escape east.\n- If they try to sidestep (UP/RIGHT), pivot RIGHT then DOWN to box them into the bottom/right corner.\n- Grow opportunistically if they leave apples exposed, but prioritize boxing and forcing errors \u2014 we\u2019re ahead, so aggression is the play.\n\nTime to get personal.

He's trapped in the corner, but he's got options. He needs to break out.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n\n**1. ELIMINATE DEAD MOVES:**\n*   **LEFT (6,5):** This is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But wait... if I go LEFT to (6,5), I move away from the enemy at (7,7). I gain a point, yes, but I let him breathe. He needs to be suffocated. Also, if he moves LEFT to (6,7), we are getting closer, but I'm extending my length away from the confrontation. I want to pressure him, not back off.\n*   **RIGHT (8,5):** I just came from here. Moving back RIGHT is moving into my own body at (8,5). **DEAD.** Never move backwards into yourself!\n*   **DOWN (7,4):** Look at the map. (7,4) is empty. No apple, no body. It's safe. But moving DOWN moves me *away* from the enemy's head (7,7). I want to close the gap and cut off his vertical escape. Moving down gives him room to slide down column 7.\n*   **UP (7,6):** (7,6) is currently empty (The enemy is at 7,7). This move moves me **TOWARDS** the enemy. It puts me directly below him. This is **AGGRESSIVE**.\n\n**2. STRATEGIC ANALYSIS & AGGRESSION:**\nI am at (7,5). Enemy is at (7,7). The distance is 2 squares vertically.\nIf I move **UP** to (7,6):\n*   I am now adjacent to his head (7,7).\n*   If he moves DOWN to (7,6), we collide head-on. He has 3 apples, I have 2. **HEAD-ON COLLISION LOSES FOR ME.** BUT... if he's trapped and panicking, he might not see it. Or he might be forced to move LEFT or UP.\n*   His body is at (7,8), (6,8), (6,7).\n*   From (7,7), he can go LEFT to (6,7). That's a valid move, but it's where his tail is? No, his tail is (6,8)? Wait, his body is [(7,7), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)]? No, the list is Head->Tail.\n    *   Head: (7,7)\n    *   Body: (7,8), (6,8), (6,7) <- Tail?\n    *   Wait, if Head is (7,7), and Body includes (7,8), then (7,8) connects to (7,7).\n    *   His body is [(7,8), (6,8), (6,7)].\n    *   So (6,7) is his tail.\n*   If Enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), we collide.\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT to (6,7), he moves into his own tail? No, his tail is (6,7). If he moves onto his tail, his tail moves away, so it's usually safe *unless* something blocks it. But (6,7) is currently occupied by his tail. Wait, rules: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... You're DEAD.\" Moving into your own tail is usually safe because the tail moves forward.\n    *   However, if he moves LEFT to (6,7), and I am at (7,6), I am diagonal to him.\n*   If I move UP to (7,6), I control the space directly below him. I force him to make a decision. I am cutting off the downward escape route.\n*   I am also close to the apple at (6,5) for the next turn if I survive.\n\n**3. THE KILL:**\nI am at (7,5). Enemy is at (7,7).\nBy moving **UP** to (7,6), I am stepping into the kill zone. I am putting my head in the line of fire.\nWhy?\nBecause I am betting on him moving LEFT or UP to escape the corner.\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,7), I am safe at (7,6).\nIf he moves UP to (7,8), I am safe at (7,6).\nIf he moves DOWN to (7,6), we collide.\nBut if I don't move UP, I let him slide down column 7. I lose pressure.\nI must squeeze him.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nMove UP to (7,6). Force the confrontation. If he moves DOWN, we die together (he wins on score 3 vs 2, so that's bad... wait. If we die together, the higher score wins. He has 3, I have 2. I DO NOT WANT A HEAD-ON COLLISION.)\n*CORRECTION:* Head-on collision is BAD for me because he has more apples.\nHowever, if I stay at (7,5) and he moves DOWN, he lives and I didn't pressure.\nIf I move UP to (7,6), I block his DOWN move effectively? No, he can still move DOWN into me.\nActually, if I move UP to (7,6) and he moves DOWN to (7,6), we collide.\nBut if I don't move UP, I'm not playing to win. I'm playing not to lose.\nWait, looking at his body... his tail is at (6,7).\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,7), he eats his tail? No, tail moves.\nActually, look at the map again.\nEnemy Head: (7,7)\nEnemy Body: (7,8), (6,8), (6,7)\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,7), that is his tail. Safe.\nIf he moves UP to (7,8), that is his body. **DEAD.**\nIf he moves DOWN to (7,6), that is empty (unless I go there).\nIf he moves RIGHT... off board? (8,7). Is that open?\nMap shows:\n(8,7) is empty?\nRow 7: `. . . . . . T T . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(6,7) is T (Tail/Body)\n(7,7) is 0 (Head)\n(8,7) is T (Body)\nSo (8,7) is occupied by his body. He cannot go RIGHT.\nSo he can ONLY go LEFT (6,7) or DOWN (7,6).\nHe cannot go UP (Hit body (7,8)). He cannot go RIGHT (Hit body (8,7)).\nHe is TRULY boxed in.\nIf I move UP to (7,6), I block his DOWN move.\nIf I block his DOWN move, his ONLY legal move is LEFT to (6,7).\nIf he moves LEFT, I am safe at (7,6).\nThis is the trap!\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **UP** to (7,6).\nThis blocks his escape down.\nIt forces him to move LEFT into his own tail (6,7).\nI stay safe.\nI close the distance.\nI assert dominance.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce him into the corner at (6,7) -> (5,7) -> etc. Choke him out. He has nowhere to go. Once he's forced into a tight spot, I take the apple at (6,5) or (5,6) to grow and maintain size advantage for the final squeeze.\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nUP",
