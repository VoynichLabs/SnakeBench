Head at (6,2), body empty.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) is at **(9,8)**. Head at (9,8), body empty. Very far away from me.\n- Apples are everywhere. Score is tied 0-0.\n- Board is 10x10.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT (TURN 0):**\n*   **UP (6,3):** Currently empty. Safe move.\n*   **DOWN (6,1):** Currently empty. Safe move.\n*   **LEFT (5,2):** Currently empty. Safe move.\n*   **RIGHT (7,2):** **CRASH!** There is an apple at (7,2). Wait, looking at the board state: `2 A . . . . . 1 A . .`. Position (7,2) is an 'A' (Apple). Moving Right into an apple is allowed and I GROW. So RIGHT is actually safe and profitable. BUT... let's look closer. (8,2) is empty. So moving RIGHT eats the apple at (7,2).\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\nRow 2 (y=2): `A . . . . . 1 A . .`\nIndex 0: (0,2) is A\nIndex 6: (6,2) is 1 (Me)\nIndex 7: (7,2) is A\nIndex 8: (8,2) is A\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,2), I eat an apple. I grow. My new body will be [(7,2), (6,2)].\nIs (7,2) safe from the enemy?\nEnemy is at (9,8). He is far. He cannot reach (7,2) in one turn.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nMy goal is to box him in. He is in the top right corner (9,8). I am in the middle-bottom right (6,2).\nTo box him in, I need to dominate the center and cut off his escape routes.\nHowever, on Turn 0, the priority is securing growth without risking immediate death.\nThe apple at (7,2) is right next to me. Eating it is free growth.\nGrowth gives me length. Length helps me control space later.\nIf I go UP, DOWN, or LEFT, I move away from this apple.\nSince the enemy is far away and the board is open, taking the free apple to grow is the optimal play. A longer snake is a stronger snake for the \"boxing in\" strategy later.\n\n**PLANNING THE MOVE:**\n1.  **RIGHT** to (7,2): Eats apple. Grows to length 2. Opens up future moves to (8,2) or (7,3)/(7,1).\n2.  **UP** to (6,3): Safe, but leaves the apple. Doesn't grow.\n3.  **DOWN** to (6,1): Safe, but leaves the apple.\n4.  **LEFT** to (5,2): Safe, but leaves the apple.\n\nTaking the apple is the most aggressive way to start the match. I need to outgrow him to force a head-on collision later.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7,2) to grow. Then assess the enemy's position. He is in the corner (9,8). I need to move towards the right side or top-middle to cut off his access to the rest of the board.\n\nDECISION: **RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

We're back in the arena and the stakes are high! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the current battlefield on Turn 1:\n\n**STATUS UPDATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7,2)** (just moved right!), Body is now [(6,2)]. Score: 1.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(9,7)**, Body is [(9,8)]. Score: 1.\n- **Apple Count:** The list shows 15 apples, but looking at the board state, I see plenty of 'A's around.\n- **Key Intel:** My opponent moved DOWN from (9,8) to (9,7). He's in the top-right corner.\n\n**ANALYZING THE SPACES (FROM HEAD AT 7,2):**\n1.  **UP -> (7,3):** Checked the board. Row 3 is all clear dots. **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN -> (7,1):** Row 1 shows `(7,1)` is an 'A' (Apple). Eating it is safe. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT -> (6,2):** That's where my tail currently is. Moving back there is technically my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **RIGHT -> (8,2):** Checked the board. Row 2 shows `(8,2)` is an 'A' (Apple). Eating it is safe. **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n- **UP** keeps us in the open middle but moves away from the bottom-left apples.\n- **DOWN** moves toward the cluster of apples at the bottom-left.\n- **RIGHT** moves toward the right edge and the apple at (8,2).\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE WIN:**\nWe need to dominate space and trap the enemy in the corner. The enemy is at (9,7). If I move **RIGHT** to (8,2), I get closer to the right side. However, looking at the apples, there's a dense cluster at the bottom left: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), etc. That's a massive food source. To box him in, I need to grow big fast. Moving **DOWN** to (7,1) allows me to pivot left next turn and start eating that bottom-left cluster while keeping the center open. Moving RIGHT commits me to the right side, which is where the enemy is, potentially leading to a risky encounter sooner.\n\nGiven the distance (he's at y=7, I'm at y=2) and the food density, I'll prioritize growth in the safe zone. **DOWN** to (7,1) is the play. It's an apple, I grow, and I position myself to sweep the bottom board.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Grow by sweeping the bottom-left apple cluster (0,0)-(2,0). Keep an eye on the enemy's rotation in the top right. Once length is sufficient, cut off his access to the center from the bottom.\n\nDOWN",

Score: 2.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(9,6)**, Body is [(9,7), (9,8)]. Score: 2.\n- **Scoreboard:** We are TIED at 2 apples. I need to pull ahead.\n- **Key Intel:** The enemy moved DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6). He's still in the top-right corner. He hasn't seen the bottom-left apples yet because he's distracted in the top-right quadrant.\n\n**ANALYZING THE SPACES (FROM HEAD AT 7,1):**\n1.  **UP -> (7,2):** That's my previous body segment (currently part of my tail). Moving UP would be hitting myself. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **DOWN -> (7,0):** Checked the board. Row 0 shows `(7,0)` is an 'A' (Apple). Eating it is safe. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT -> (6,1):** Checked the board. Row 1 shows `(6,1)` is a '.' (Empty). **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT -> (8,1):** Checked the board. Row 1 shows `(8,1)` is an 'A' (Apple). Eating it is safe. **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- **LEFT (6,1):** Moves us toward the center and the bottom-left cluster. However, it moves into an empty square. No immediate growth.\n- **RIGHT (8,1):** Moves us to the right edge. There's an apple there, but I'm getting close to the enemy's territory (he's at x=9). This might force a confrontation too early.\n- **DOWN (7,0):** Moves us down to (7,0), which is an apple. This scores a point, putting me ahead 3-2. It also positions me on the bottom edge, ready to sweep left towards the dense bottom-left cluster (0,0 to 2,0) while keeping distance from the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE WIN:**\nWe need to break the tie and secure a lead. Moving **DOWN** to (7,0) secures an apple, grows my snake, and pushes my lead to 3-2. From (7,0), I can turn left next turn and start eating the row of apples at y=0 ((6,0), (5,0), etc.). This allows me to chain-eat and grow massive while the enemy is still navigating the top-right. The goal is to be so big that I can box him in later.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:** Secure the 3-2 lead now at (7,0). Next turn, pivot LEFT towards (6,0) to start the bottom-row sweep. Grow fast, dominate the board.\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

We need to break this tie aggressively.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (FROM HEAD AT 7,0):**\nWe are currently sitting at the bottom edge. Let's check the immediate moves:\n1. **UP -> (7,1):** This is my previous body segment (currently the tail). Moving UP would hit myself. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n2. **DOWN -> (7,-1):** That\u2019s off the board (y-coordinate -1). **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n3. **LEFT -> (6,0):** Checked the board.

While this is technically safe, it moves us right, away from the dense bottom-left apple cluster. It also brings us closer to the enemy's vertical territory at x=9. It doesn't score, and it delays our lead.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE WIN:**\nThe enemy is currently occupied in the top-right (x=8-9, y=6-9). They haven't seen the bottom row apples yet. The bottom row from x=0 to x=6 is packed with food.\n**GOAL:** Chain-eat the bottom row. By moving **LEFT** to (6,0), I secure an apple, take the lead 3-2, and position myself perfectly to continue eating the row at (5,0), (4,0), etc. This is the fastest way to grow massive and dominate the board before the enemy realizes what's happening.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nEat the bottom row leftwards. Secure the lead immediately. Once the bottom row is clear or the enemy approaches, use my size to box him in the top-right.\n\nLet's get this apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Moving into your own tail is safe *if* the tail moves away (which it does, as we aren't growing unless we eat). However, looking at the board, (7,0) is currently my body. Wait, checking the coordinates again: My body is `[(7,0), (7,1)]`. (7,0) is directly to my right. Moving right into (7,0) is hitting my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe are pinned against the bottom wall (can't go DOWN). We can't go RIGHT into our own body.\n- **LEFT (5,0):** This hits an apple! We grow, score becomes 3-3, and we tie the score. We stay on the bottom row, getting closer to the apple at (4,0) and the big cluster at (0,0)-(2,0).\n- **UP (6,1):** This is empty. It moves us off the bottom row. It gives us access to the vertical space, but it doesn't score points immediately.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE WIN:**\nThe enemy is at (8,7). They are far away. They are currently focused on the top-right cluster. The bottom row is MINE. I can chain-eat these apples to grow fast.\n**GOAL:** Tie the score immediately by eating the apple at (5,0). Then, continue sweeping left to (4,0), (3,0) to secure the lead. Eating apples grows my body, making it harder for the enemy to box me in later.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nEat the bottom row apples. Chain (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0). Once the bottom row is clear, assess if we can trap the enemy in the top-right corner or force a head-on collision when we have the size advantage.\n\nLet's get that apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're on turn 5 and the pressure is mounting! Let's analyze the grid.\n\n**STATUS CHECK:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(5,0)**. Body: [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1)]. Apples: 3.\n    *   *Correction on my previous turn:* I said I was at (6,0) with body (7,0), (7,1). The replay confirms I moved **LEFT** from (6,0) to (5,0) to eat the apple. Now I'm at (5,0) and my body is [(6,0), (7,0), (7,1)].\n    *   **Growth:** I ate an apple at (5,0) on the last turn, so my tail at (7,1) will stay this turn (I grew), or rather, if I don't eat, my tail moves forward. Wait, actually, since I ate, my length increases by 1. My tail remains at (7,1) this turn. If I don't eat now, next turn the tail will move.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(7,7)**. Body: [(8,7), (8,6), (9,6)]. Apples: 3.\n*   **Scoreboard:** 3-3. TIED. The chase is ON!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (FROM HEAD AT 5,0):**\nI am currently at (5,0). Let's look at my options:\n1.  **DOWN (5, -1):** Off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **LEFT (4, 0):** Checking the board grid at y=0: `A A A . . 1 T T . .` (Wait, my head is at 5,0, so the row is `A A A . . [HEAD] T T . .`). Actually, looking at the provided board state for y=0: `A A A . . 1 T T . .`. The positions are:\n    *   (0,0): A\n    *   (1,0): A\n    *   (2,0): A\n    *   (3,0): .\n    *   (4,0): .\n    *   (5,0): 1 (Me)\n    *   (6,0): T (My body)\n    *   (7,0): T (My body)\n    *   (8,0): .\n    *   (9,0): .\n    *   So **LEFT to (4,0)** is Empty (.) and an Apple `A` is at (3,0). **SAFE.**\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 0):** (6,0) is currently my own body (Tail). **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **UP (5, 1):** Checking the board at y=1: `A . . . . . . T A .`. (5,1) is Empty (.) and there is a Snake body part at (7,1). **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe have two safe moves: **LEFT (4,0)** and **UP (5,1)**.\n*   **LEFT (4,0):** Moves me closer to the apple at (3,0) and the cluster at (0,0)-(2,0). It keeps me on the bottom row where I have wall protection on one side (Down) and my own body blocking the right side, creating a safe corridor to the left. However, it leaves me open to being potentially cut off by the enemy if they drop down later.\n*   **UP (5,1):** Moves me off the bottom row. This is **TACTICAL**. Why?\n    *   The board at y=1 has an apple at (0,1).\n    *   It gives me vertical mobility.\n    *   The enemy is at (7,7). If I stay on the bottom row, I'm predictable. If I go UP, I can start moving left through the upper lanes (y=1, y=2) where there are apples at (1,2), (2,0), (3,5), etc.\n    *   More importantly, looking at the board layout: If I go UP to (5,1), I can then go LEFT to (4,1), etc. This opens up the board.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (4,0), I'm committing to the bottom row. The bottom row ends at (0,0). If I eat the apples there (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), I will be trapped against the left wall with a long body. The enemy can easily loop around and trap me against the wall because I have no escape route.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (7,7). They are in the top right. I am in the bottom left.\nIf I go **UP**, I enter the \"middle\" of the board. I can then sweep left across y=1 or y=2.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am committing to the bottom edge. While it gets me an apple immediately (at 3,0 eventually), it is a \"dead end\" strategy. In Snake, being against a wall is dangerous because you limit your turning radius.\n**GOAL:** Gain positional advantage. The bottom row is a trap waiting to happen if I grow too long. Going UP keeps my options open (I can go left, right, up, or down from (5,1)). Staying on the bottom row limits me to Left or Up (since Right is blocked by my body).\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nGo UP to (5,1) to get out of the corner. Then sweep LEFT across the mid-board (y=1 or y=2). I want to control the center and left side of the board, forcing the enemy into the top-right corner. Don't get boxed in on the bottom!\n\nLet's make the strategic play! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Let's break down the grid from my current head at **(5,1)**.\n\n**STATUS CHECK:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(5,1)**.\n    *   **Body:** [(5,0), (6,0), (7,0)]. (The tail is at (7,0) because I ate an apple on the previous turn, so I grew and the tail stayed).\n    *   **Score:** 3.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(6,7)**. Body: [(7,7), (8,7), (8,6)]. Score: 3.\n    *   *Wait, I need to double-check the replay.* The replay said Enemy Head was at (6,7) with body (7,7), (8,7), (9,6). But the main board state says `0 T T .` at y=7. Let me look closely at the board grid provided:\n        *   Row 7: `. . . A . . 0 T T .` (Indices 0-9). So:\n            *   (5,7): .\n            *   (6,7): 0 (Enemy Head)\n            *   (7,7): T (Enemy Body)\n            *   (8,7): T (Enemy Body)\n            *   (9,7): . (Empty)\n    *   This matches the replay. The Enemy is at **(6,7)**.\n    *   **My Body:** Row 1: `A . . . . 1 . . A .`. Row 0: `A A A . . T T T . .`. So:\n        *   (5,1): 1 (Me)\n        *   (5,0): T (My Body)\n        *   (6,0): T (My Body)\n        *   (7,0): T (My Body)\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (From Head at 5,1):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (5, 0):**\n    *   Target: (5,0).\n    *   Status: **OCCUPIED BY MY OWN BODY (Tail).**\n    *   Result: **DEATH** \ud83d\udeab. I cannot move back into my own tail. Game over. Eliminate.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (6, 1):**\n    *   Target: (6,1).\n    *   Status: Checking Row 1 (`A . . . . 1 . .

A`):\n        *   (5,2) is **Empty (.)**.\n    *   **SAFE**.\n\n**ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**\nI have three safe moves: **RIGHT (6,1)**, **LEFT (4,1)**, and **UP (5,2)**.\n\n*   **Goal:** Dominate the board and force the enemy into a corner. We are tied. I need to control the center and left side.\n*   **Right (6,1):** This moves me slightly closer to the enemy (who is at x=6, y=7), but it keeps me in the middle column. The bottom row is packed with apples (0,0) to (2,0), but I need to be careful about getting trapped. Moving Right puts my back to the bottom row (y=0) and I have my body at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0).\n*   **Left (4,1):** This moves me towards the left wall and the apples at (0,1), (0,2), (2,0). However, (4,1) is safe *now*, but looking ahead, the path to the left (Row 1) is blocked by an apple at (0,1) and my own potential growth. Actually, looking at the grid:\n    *   Row 1: `A . . . . 1 . . A .`\n    *   If I go Left, I can go Left again to (3,1), then Left to (2,1), etc. But the left side has an apple cluster at the bottom (0,0-2,0). To eat those efficiently from (5,1), going Left isn't the most direct path unless I go Down first (which is death).\n    *   If I go Left, I am moving away from the enemy who is at (6,7). That might give him control of the right side.\n*   **Up (5,2):**\n    *   This moves me to Row 2.\n    *   Row 2 is: `A A . . . . . . . A`. (5,2) is empty.\n    *   From (5,2), I have options: Left to (4,2) (Empty), Right to (6,2) (Empty), or Up to (5,3) (Empty? Checking Row 3: `A . . . . . A . . .` -> (5,3) is empty).\n    *   **Strategic Advantage:** Moving Up takes me into the central area. It opens up the board. I can then sweep Left or Right. The Enemy is at (6,7). By moving Up, I am moving into the zone where the action is happening (mid-board). Staying on the bottom row (y=1) feels passive.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP** is the best move. It gives me the most mobility and keeps me away from the walls and my own tail. It allows me to pivot left or right next turn based on the enemy's move. If I go Left now, I commit to the left side, but the apples are mostly bottom-left, and I'd have to weave around. Going Up gives me control of the vertical axis.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nGo UP to the center. From the center (Row 2/3), I can start sweeping left to intercept the apple cluster at (0,1) and (0,2) and control the left side of the board, pushing the enemy (who is currently top-right) further into the corner.\n\nUP",

The enemy is moving down towards the center (y=6). I need to secure resources and cut off his access to the bottom-left apple cluster.\n*   **RIGHT (6,2):** Moves me toward the enemy who is at (6,6). This is a collision course. While I could try to force a head-on collision, he has 4 apples to my 3. If we collide, I lose the tie-breaker. Also, moving Right brings me closer to the right wall, which is dangerous.\n*   **UP (5,3):** Moves me deeper into the center vertical column. This keeps my options open, but it also aligns me vertically with the enemy at (6,6). If I go UP now, I might get stuck in the middle without access to the apple cluster on the left.\n*   **LEFT (4,2):** This is the winning move. Why?\n    1.  **Escapes the Vertical Trap:** By moving Left, I break the vertical alignment with the enemy. He is at x=6, I am moving to x=4. I am now to his left.\n    2.  **Approaches the Apple Cluster:** The massive apple cluster is at (0,0)-(2,0) and (0,1)-(0,2). Moving Left is the first step toward dominating the bottom-left corner.\n    3.  **Future Mobility:** From (4,2), I can go DOWN to (4,1) (Empty), LEFT to (3,2) (Empty), or UP to (4,3) (Empty? Checking Row 3: `A . . . . . A . . .` -> (4,3) is empty). This gives me three future options.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**LEFT**. I'm claiming the left side of the board. The enemy is too slow to catch me there. I need to eat those bottom-left apples to tie or take the lead before engaging him.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nGo LEFT to (4,2). Next turn, I will likely go DOWN to (4,1) or (4,0) to start eating the apple cluster at the bottom. I need to grow fast. Once I have a size advantage, I can swing back right and box the enemy in against the right wall. I will control the board.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If I go DOWN, I might be trapping myself against the bottom wall if the enemy pressures from above.\n*   **LEFT (3,1):** Moves me away from the center column where the enemy is currently located (4,6). This is crucial! I need to get away from his vertical path. From (3,1), I can continue left to (2,1) which is an apple, or down to (3,0) which is an apple. This opens up the bottom-left quadrant for me while keeping distance from the enemy approaching from the right.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**LEFT** to (3,1). The enemy is rushing the center (4,6), likely trying to cut me off or claim the central apples. By moving LEFT, I am dodging his potential vertical descent and securing the bottom-left area. I see an apple at (2,1) directly to my left next turn. If I go DOWN now, I might end up in a tight spot against the wall. Moving LEFT gives me more maneuvering room.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDodge the enemy's vertical rush by hugging the left wall. Sweep the bottom-left apples (2,1), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0) to build up score. Once I've eaten the cluster and the enemy passes my x-coordinate, I can circle back up or look for a trap opportunity.\n\nLEFT",

A .`\n        Wait, the prompt's grid is a visual representation.\n        Row 1: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        My head is at (3,1). The visual shows `.` at (3,1)?\n        Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n        My head is at (3,1). In the text grid:\n        (0,1) is '1' (Wait, that's (0,1)? No, index 0 is '1', index 1 is 'A', index 2 is '.', index 3 is '.', index 4 is '1'.\n        Actually, the prompt says:\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        This corresponds to x=0 through x=9.\n        x=0: '1' (Is this my body? No, my head is (3,1). The '1' at x=0 is likely the apple at (0,1) listed in Apple Drops? No, the prompt says `APPLE DROPS: (0, 1)`.\n        Let's look at the '1' in the grid. It could be my body? My body is [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)].\n        Wait, I moved LEFT to (3,1).\n        The prompt's board state is:\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        This is confusing. Let's look at the `APPLE DROPS`.\n        (0,1) is an apple. (1,0) is an apple.\n        The grid shows `1` at (0,1)? No, `1` is likely my ID representing a body part or head if it's there?\n        Actually, the prompt says:\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Let's map this to (x,y).\n        x=0: '1' -> This must be (0,1)? No, the prompt says \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n        The bottom row (y=0) is `A A A . . . . . . .`\n        Row 1 (y=1) is `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        My head is (3,1). So at x=3, y=1.\n        The string at y=1 is: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Indices: 0: '1', 1: 'A', 2: '.', 3: '.', 4: '1', 5: 'T', ...\n        Wait, my head is (3,1). The character at index 3 is '.'.\n        So (3,1) is Empty. Correct.\n        What about (2,1)? Index 2 is '.' -> Empty.\n        What about (1,1)? Index 1 is 'A' -> Apple.\n        What about (0,1)? Index 0 is '1' -> Is this my body?\n        My body is at (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        (0,1) is NOT my body.\n        (0,1) is listed in Apple Drops.\n        However, the grid shows '1' at (0,1). This is confusing. Usually '1' indicates the snake ID 1.\n        But my body is at (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        Maybe the '1' at (0,1) is just a typo in the visualization or refers to something else?\n        Let's assume the grid is accurate. If (0,1) is '1', and it's not my head or body, maybe it's just a visual artifact?\n        Actually, looking closely at the previous turn's board:\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Wait, my head was at (4,1) in turn 9.\n        The grid showed `A . . . 1 T . . A .` at row 1.\n        At x=4, y=1, it was '1'. That was my head.\n        Now I moved LEFT to (3,1).\n        So (3,1) should be '1' (my head).\n        (4,1) should be 'T' (my tail? No, my body is [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2) ].\n        Wait, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n        My head is (3,1).\n        Body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        So (4,1) is the first segment.\n        (4,2) is the second.\n        (5,2) is the tail.\n        So (4,1) is part of my body.\n        The grid shows `1 A . . 1 T . . A .` at row 1.\n        x=0: '1' (Wait, is this (0,1) an apple or my body?)\n        Let's check Apple Drops: (0,1) IS an apple.\n        Why is the grid showing '1' at (0,1)?\n        Maybe the '1' in the grid is just the character '1' representing the apple at (0,1)? No, apples are usually 'A'.\n        Or maybe the prompt's visualization is slightly off or using '1' for ID 1's apple?\n        Let's look at the turn 9 board again.\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        My head was at (4,1). The char at index 4 was '1'.\n        My body at (4,2) was 'T' (visualizing the tail or body?).\n        The enemy body parts are 'T' (e.g., (4,6) is '0', (5,6) is 'T').\n        So 'T' is usually the enemy body or my body?\n        In the turn 9 board:\n        Enemy head: (4,7) -> '0' (Row 7).\n        Enemy body: (4,6) -> 'T' (Row 6).\n        My body: (4,1) -> '1' (Row 1). (4,2) -> 'T' (Row 2).\n        Wait, (4,2) in turn 9 was 'T'?\n        Turn 9 Board:\n        Row 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`\n        x=4, y=2 is 'T'. x=5, y=2 is 'T'.\n        My body parts are (4,2) and (5,2). So 'T' represents my body parts (and enemy body parts).\n        My head (4,1) was '1'.\n        Enemy head (4,7) was '0'.\n        So '1' is strictly my head.\n        'T' is my body or enemy body.\n        '0' is enemy head.\n        'A' is apple.\n        '.' is empty.\n\n        Let's re-evaluate the CURRENT board state.\n        **Current Board:**\n        Row 9: `A A A . . . . . . .`\n        ...\n        Row 7: `A . . A 0 T T . . .`\n        Row 6: `A . . . T T T . . A`\n        Row 5: `A . . A . . . . . .`\n        Row 4: `A . . . . . . A . .`\n        Row 3: `A . . . . . A . . .`\n        Row 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`\n        Row 1: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`  <-- THIS IS THE ISSUE.\n        Row 0: `A A A . . . . . . .`\n\n        Let's parse Row 1 carefully: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Indices 0-9.\n        x=0: '1' -> This MUST be the apple at (0,1) listed in Apple Drops. But it's marked '1'. Maybe it's a visual bug where it's showing the Apple Drop list index? No, that's crazy.\n        OR, is it possible that (0,1) is occupied by MY HEAD? No, my head is (3,1).\n        Is it possible (0,1) is occupied by MY BODY?\n        My body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2). No.\n        Is it possible (0,1) is occupied by ENEMY BODY?\n        Enemy body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7). No.\n\n        Let's look at the prompt's Apple Drops again.\n        (8, 1), (4, 8), (0, 1), (3, 7), (0, 2), (2, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), (9, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (1, 2), (3, 5), (9, 6), (3, 9)\n        (0,1) is definitely an apple.\n\n        Why does the grid say '1' at (0,1)?\n        Maybe the '1' is just a visual artifact or a mistake in the prompt's board generation?\n        Let's look at the '1' at index 4 in Row 1.\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Index 4 is '1'. My head is at (3,1).\n        Wait, did I move LEFT or did I move somewhere else?\n        My last move was LEFT.\n        From (4,1) to (3,1).\n        So my head should be at (3,1).\n        In the grid at Row 1, Index 3 is '.'.\n        Index 4 is '1'.\n        This implies the grid hasn't updated my head position? Or I am actually at (4,1)?\n        Let's check the \"MY SNAKE\" status again.\n        `Head: (3, 1)`\n        `Body: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2)]`\n        Okay, the status says (3,1).\n        The grid says `.` at (3,1).\n        The grid says `1` at (4,1).\n        This is a conflict.\n        The prompt says: `--YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):--` -> `LEFT`.\n        Result: `Head: (3, 1)`.\n        If the grid is wrong, I must trust the text status: **Head is at (3,1).**\n        The grid shows '.' at (3,1).\n        The grid shows '1' at (4,1).\n        Maybe the grid represents the state *before* my move?\n        No, the prompt says \"BOARD STATE:\" and then gives the grid.\n        If the grid is accurate to the CURRENT state (Turn 10), and my status says (3,1), then (3,1) is empty.\n        And (4,1) is '1'.\n        This implies (4,1) is occupied by... something. My body? Yes, (4,1) is the first segment of my body.\n        So '1' in the grid might represent my body?\n        But 'T' is used for body parts too.\n        Let's look at Row 7: `A . . A 0 T T . . .`\n        Enemy head at (4,7) is '0'.\n        Enemy body at (5,7) is 'T'. (Wait, enemy body is (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)).\n        (5,7) is 'T'. Is (5,7) in the enemy body list? No.\n        Enemy body list: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7).\n        (5,7) is NOT in the list.\n        However, (6,7) is 'T' (Index 6, Row 7).\n        (7,7) is 'T' (Index 7, Row 7).\n        (4,6) is 'T' (Row 6, Index 4).\n        (5,6) is 'T' (Row 6, Index 5).\n        (6,6) is 'T' (Row 6, Index 6).\n\n        So 'T' covers enemy body parts.\n        What about my body?\n        My body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        Row 1: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        (4,1) is '1'. (4,2) is 'T'. (5,2) is 'T'.\n        It seems '1' is used for my body parts (specifically the one adjacent to the head? Or just random).\n        And 'T' is used for all other body parts (mine and enemies).\n        Or maybe '1' is my specific ID for body parts?\n        Let's look at the Turn 9 Board again to verify.\n        Turn 9 Board:\n        `A . . . 1 T . . A .` at Row 1.\n        My head was at (4,1). It was '1'.\n        My body at (4,2) was 'T'.\n        So '1' represents MY HEAD.\n        'T' represents MY BODY and ENEMY BODY.\n        '0' represents ENEMY HEAD.\n\n        Now look at Turn 10 Board:\n        `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        My head is at (3,1).\n        The grid shows '.' at (3,1).\n        The grid shows '1' at (0,1) and (4,1).\n        (4,1) is my body part.\n        (0,1) is an apple? Or is it my body? No, my body is at (4,1).\n        Is it possible (0,1) is just a visual glitch where 'A' (Apple) is replaced by '1'?\n        Or is (0,1) actually a body part?\n        Let's look at Row 1 again: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Index 0: '1' (Could be (0,1)?)\n        Index 4: '1' (Could be (4,1)?)\n        If (4,1) is '1', then '1' represents my body.\n        If (0,1) is '1', then (0,1) is my body? No, my body is (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        So (0,1) is NOT my body.\n        Therefore, the '1' at (0,1) must be a mistake in the visualization or represents an apple.\n        But Apples are 'A'.\n        Let's look at the Apple Drops list again.\n        (0,1) is there.\n        Maybe the board state provided is slightly scrambled or I am misinterpreting the grid coordinates.\n        The prompt says: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n        Row 0 is bottom. Row 9 is top.\n        Columns 0-9 are left to right.\n\n        Let's assume the grid is **mostly correct** and look at the **empty spaces**.\n        My head is at (3,1).\n        The grid at Row 1, Col 3 is '.'.\n        That confirms (3,1) is empty (or rather, I am standing there and the grid hasn't drawn me? No, usually the grid shows the current state).\n        If the grid doesn't show me, I have to assume the space is empty *unless* occupied by an obstacle I know of.\n\n        **OBSTACLES (Known):**\n        - **My Body:** (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n        - **Enemy Body:** (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7).\n        - **Enemy Head:** (4,7).\n        - **Apples:** List provided.\n\n        **MOVEMENT OPTIONS (From 3,1):**\n\n        1.  **UP (3, 2):**\n            -   Target: (3,2).\n            -   Grid: Row 2, Col 3.\n            -   Row 2: `A A . .

I am safe from him for now.\n        I must avoid getting cut off.\n        If I go UP to (3,2), I am entering the center territory. The enemy is at y=7. I am at y=1. It's a big gap.\n        However, going UP brings me closer to the enemy's vertical reach.\n        Going DOWN or LEFT keeps me away.\n\n        **Comparison with Last Turn Logic:**\n        Last turn I chose LEFT to get away from center.\n        If I go DOWN now, I go to (3,0).\n        From (3,0), I can go LEFT to (2,0) [Apple].\n        If I go LEFT now, I go to (2,1).\n        From (2,1), I can go DOWN to (2,0) [Apple].\n        Both lead to the same apple (2,0) eventually.\n\n        **Which move is better?**\n        **Option LEFT (2,1):**\n        -   Moving along row 1.\n        -   (2,1) is empty.\n        -   Next turn I can target (1,1) or (2,0) or (1,2) or (0,1).\n        -   This keeps me slightly higher up, potentially cutting off the enemy if he decides to come down the left side (unlikely, he's on the right).\n        -   However, (2,1) is safe.\n\n        **Option DOWN (3,0):**\n        -   Moves me to the bottom wall.\n        -   I lose vertical mobility (can't go down anymore).\n        -   But I gain access to the row 0 apples immediately.\n        -   (2,0) is an apple.\n        -   If I go DOWN, I commit to the bottom row.\n        -   Is there a risk? The enemy is far away.\n        -   If I go DOWN, next turn I can go LEFT to (2,0) (Apple).\n        -   If I go LEFT now, next turn I can go DOWN to (2,0) (Apple).\n\n        **Wait, looking at the grid again:**\n        Row 1: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Index 1 is 'A'. (1,1) is an Apple.\n        My list of apples: (8,1), (4,8), (0,1), (3,7), (0,2), (2,0), (0,0), (1,0), (9,2), (7,4), (6,3), (1,2), (3,5), (9,6), (3,9).\n        (1,1) is NOT in the apple list.\n        So the 'A' at (1,1) in the grid is likely just a visual representation of an empty space or I'm misreading the grid.\n        Let's rely on the Apple Drops list.\n        Apples reachable:\n        - (2,0) - Reachable via DOWN->LEFT or LEFT->DOWN.\n        - (1,0) - Reachable after (2,0).\n        - (0,0) - Reachable after (1,0).\n        - (0,1) - Reachable via LEFT->LEFT (if I was at (1,1)). But (1,1) is empty?\n        - (1,2) - Up and left.\n        - (0,2) - Up and left.\n\n        **Strategic Decision:**\n        The enemy is at (4,7).\n        He has 5 apples. I have 3.\n        I need to grow.\n        The bottom-left is safe.\n        If I go DOWN to (3,0), I am at the bottom edge. This limits my escape routes to LEFT and RIGHT.\n        If I go LEFT to (2,1), I am one step away from the bottom edge, but I still have the option to go UP to (2,2) or DOWN to (2,0).\n        **UP (3,2)** is risky. It moves me toward the center. The enemy might drop down.\n        **RIGHT (4,1)** is death.\n\n        Between LEFT and DOWN:\n        **LEFT (2,1):**\n        -   Keeps me slightly flexible.\n        -   Next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,0) [Apple].\n        -   Or LEFT to (1,1) [Empty].\n        -   Or UP to (2,2) [Empty? Row 2, Col 2 is '.'].\n        **DOWN (3,0):**\n        -   Commits to the wall.\n        -   Next turn, I can go LEFT to (2,0) [Apple].\n        -   Or RIGHT to (4,0) [Empty].\n        -   Can't go DOWN.\n\n        The apple at (2,0) is the closest. Both moves lead there.\n        However, being on the wall (y=0) is slightly more dangerous if an enemy approaches from the top (unlikely here) or if I get trapped in the corner.\n        Being at (2,1) gives me an \"out\" upwards if the enemy somehow floods the bottom row (impossible at this stage).\n        But (2,1) is adjacent to the empty space at (1,1) and the wall at (2,0).\n        Actually, (2,1) is safer than (3,0) because (3,0) is closer to the center column (x=3) than (2,1) (x=2).\n        The enemy is at x=4.\n        If I go to (2,1), I am further away in x-coordinate.\n        If I go to (3,0), I am at x=3.\n        The enemy is at x=4.\n        Distance to enemy:\n        - From (2,1): Distance x=2, y=1. Enemy x=4, y=7. dx=2, dy=6.\n        - From (3,0): Distance x=3, y=0. Enemy x=4, y=7. dx=1, dy=7.\n\n        Wait, distance doesn't matter as much as blocking.\n        If I am at (3,0), I am blocking the column x=3 at the bottom.\n        If I am at (2,1), I am blocking column x=2.\n        The enemy is at x=4.\n        If the enemy rushes down the x=4 column, I am safe.\n        If the enemy rushes down the x=3 column, (3,0) is at the bottom. He would have to travel through (3,1) [I'm moving from here], (3,2), etc.\n        If I leave (3,1), (3,1) becomes empty.\n        If I go to (2,1), (3,1) becomes empty.\n        If I go to (3,0), (3,1) becomes empty.\n\n        **Wait, let's look at the apple at (0,1).**\n        The grid shows `1` at (0,1). This is confusing.\n        If (0,1) is an apple, I want it.\n        From (3,1), to get to (0,1), I need to go LEFT 3 times.\n        Path: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n        From (3,0), to get to (0,1), I need to go LEFT to (0,0) then UP to (0,1).\n        Or LEFT to (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1).\n        The path via (2,1) is more direct to (0,1) *if* (1,1) is clear.\n        Is (1,1) clear? The grid shows `A` at (1,1) (Index 1, Row 1).\n        But (1,1) is not in the apple list.\n        Maybe the grid's 'A' just means \"area of interest\" or is a visual bug.\n        I will assume (1,1) is EMPTY unless proven otherwise.\n\n        **Decision:**\n        I will go **LEFT** to (2,1).\n        Why?\n        1.  It moves me further left, away from the enemy's x=4 column.\n        2.  It keeps me at y=1, preserving the option to go UP (to y=2) if needed, or DOWN to y=0 (to grab apples).\n        3.  If I go DOWN to (3,0), I am at y=0. I can't go down further. I am pinned to the wall.\n        4.  By going LEFT to (2,1), I can then go DOWN to (2,0) (Apple) next turn.\n        5.  I avoid the \"trap\" of the bottom wall for one more turn.\n\n        **Plan:**\n        Move LEFT to (2,1).\n        Next turn, move DOWN to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n        Then sweep left along the bottom row: (1,0), (0,0).\n        Then check for (0,1) and (1,2), (0,2).\n\n        Let's double check the grid for (2,1).\n        Row 1: `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`\n        Index 2 is '.'.\n        Safe.\n\n        What about the apple at (1,2)?\n        From (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2) then LEFT to (1,2).\n        (2,2) is Row 2, Index 2. Row 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`. Index 2 is '.'.\n        Safe.\n\n        What if the enemy moves to (4,6) (Down)?\n        He is at (4,7). He can go DOWN to (4,6).\n        (4,6) is currently 'T' (his body).\n        So he can't go there unless he grows and his tail moves?\n        Wait, his body is [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)].\n        Head at (4,7).\n        If he moves DOWN to (4,6), that is currently his body segment (the first one).\n        But if he moves, his tail (7,7) will lift.\n        So (4,6) will become empty? No, (4,6) is the segment immediately behind his head.\n        In Snake, if the head moves forward, the body follows.\n        If he moves DOWN to (4,6), his new body will be:\n        Head: (4,6)\n        Body: [(4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)] (assuming tail (7,7) moves to (6,7)).\n        Wait, the list is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n        Current: Head (4,7), Body [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)].\n        If he moves DOWN to (4,6):\n        New Head: (4,6).\n        New Body: [(4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].\n        Yes, (4,6) becomes part of the body (specifically the second segment).\n        So he CAN move into his own body? No, he moves into the cell currently occupied by his first body segment.\n        The rule says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n        Wait, usually in snake games, the head can move into the cell the neck is currently in, because the neck moves away.\n        But the prompt says \"simultaneously\".\n        \"Move into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\"\n        This implies I cannot move into the cell occupied by a body segment, even if that segment will move away.\n        So if Enemy moves DOWN to (4,6), and (4,6) is currently his body, does he die?\n        \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n        If he moves into his own body, he dies.\n        So he cannot move DOWN to (4,6) because it is currently occupied by his body.\n        He must move to an empty cell or an apple.\n        Current empty cells around him (4,7):\n        - (4,8): Apple? Yes, (4,8) is in the list.\n        - (3,7): Apple? Yes, (3,7) is in the list.\n        - (5,7): Empty? Row 7, Index 5 is 'T' (Wait, enemy body is (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)).\n        (5,7) is NOT in his body list.\n        Row 7: `A . . A 0 T T . . .`\n        Index 5 is 'T'.\n        Is this 'T' my body? No.\n        Is it enemy body? No (list is (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (7,7)).\n        (5,7) is empty in the list, but marked 'T' on the board.\n        Maybe it's a visualization error or (5,7) is occupied by *something*.\n        Let's assume the board is correct. If (5,7) is 'T', it's occupied.\n        So (5,7) is blocked.\n        (4,8) is Apple (Safe).\n        (3,7) is Apple (Safe).\n        (4,6) is Enemy Body (Deadly for him).\n        (5,6) is Enemy Body (Deadly for him).\n\n        So the enemy is trapped in the sense that he has limited moves.\n        He can go UP to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,7).\n        He cannot go DOWN or RIGHT (into body or wall/obstacle).\n        If he goes UP, he gets an apple.\n        If he goes LEFT, he gets an apple.\n        He will likely not come down to attack me this turn.\n        This makes my bottom-left sweep even safer.\n\n        **Final check on my move:**\n        LEFT to (2,1).\n        It is empty.\n        It is safe.\n        It sets up the apple sweep.\n\n        **One detail:**\n        The apple at (2,0) is there.\n        If I go LEFT to (2,1), I am adjacent to it.\n        Next turn I can go DOWN to (2,0).\n        If I go DOWN to (3,0), I am adjacent to it (x=3, y=0).\n        Next turn I can go LEFT to (2,0).\n        Both are valid.\n        However, being at (2,1) allows me to pivot to (1,1) or (2,2) if the enemy suddenly rushes (unlikely).\n        Being at (3,0) traps me against the wall.\n        I prefer flexibility.\n\n        Let's look at the Apple (0,1) again.\n        The grid shows `1` at (0,1). I'll ignore the '1' and assume it's an apple or empty.\n        If it's an apple, I want it.\n        Path: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n        If (1,1) is blocked, I go (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1).\n        I have options.\n\n        Let's roll.\n\n        **PLAN:**\n        Go LEFT to (2,1).\n        Next turn, head for (2,0) (Apple).\n        Then sweep (1,0), (0,0).\n        Watch the enemy (he's stuck in the top right corner for now).\n\n        LEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--END OF REPLAY--",

He cannot reach me this turn.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (From Head at 2, 1):**\nMy goal is to sweep the apples at (2,0), (1,0), and (0,0) while keeping track of (0,1) and (1,1).\n\n1.  **UP (2, 2):**\n    *   Target: (2,2).\n    *   Status: Row 2 shows `A A . .

Score to 4.\n    *   *Future:* From (1,1), I can go DOWN to (1,0) (Apple), LEFT to (0,1) (Apple), or UP to (1,2) (Apple). This is actually a DANGEROUS position if the enemy weren't stuck. (1,2) is an apple, but (1,3) is empty, (1,4) is empty... actually it's fine. But (1,0) and (0,0) are waiting. Moving LEFT here keeps me on row 1, which is slightly further from the cluster at (0,0) and (2,0).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 1):**\n    *   Target: (3,1).\n    *   Status: Row 1 shows `1 A . . 1 T . . A .`. (3,1) is **Empty (.)**.\n    *   **SAFE**.\n    *   *Analysis:* Back to where I was. Not useful.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to eat. The enemy is stuck at (4,8) or (3,8) or dead. He is NOT a threat.\nI am sitting on two apples: (2,0) DOWN and (1,1) LEFT.\nBoth yield +1 score.\nHowever, (2,0) is in the corner. (1,1) is more open.\nBUT, looking at the board:\nRow 0: `(0,0) A`, `(1,0) A`, `(2,0) A`.\nRow 1: `(0,1) A`, `(1,1) A`.\nIf I go DOWN to (2,0), I am immediately adjacent to TWO more apples at (1,0) and (0,0).\nIf I go LEFT to (1,1), I am adjacent to (0,1), (1,0), and (0,0).\nThe \"Apple Cluster\" in the bottom left is denser.\nGoing DOWN to (2,0) allows me to clear the bottom row effectively.\nActually, if I go LEFT to (1,1), I can then go DOWN to (1,0) and then LEFT to (0,0).\nIf I go DOWN to (2,0), I can go LEFT to (1,0) and then LEFT to (0,0).\nThe path length is similar.\nHowever, starting at (2,0) puts me closer to the wall, which might be slightly more restrictive than (1,1).\nBut (2,0) is an apple I am currently touching.\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nThe enemy is not threatening the bottom left.\nI should maximize my immediate safety and growth.\n(1,1) is a central pivot point. (2,0) is a corner pivot.\n(1,1) feels more flexible. From (1,1), I can access (0,1), (1,0), (2,0) (via (2,1) -> (2,0) next turn).\nWait, if I go LEFT to (1,1), I block my direct path to (2,0) if I want it immediately, but I can loop around.\nActually, (2,0) is right there.\nLet's look at the board again.\n`1 A . . 1 T . . A .` (Row 1)\n`A A A . . . . . . .` (Row 0)\nAt (2,1), looking at (1,1) and (2,0).\n(1,1) is an apple.\n(2,0) is an apple.\nThe enemy is at (4,8). He has 0% chance of hitting me this turn. He is trapped in the top right. He can only go LEFT (3,8) or DIE. He cannot go DOWN.\nTherefore, I am 100% safe to eat.\nWhich apple is better?\n(2,0) is at the corner. (1,1) is \"open\".\nBut (1,1) leads to (1,0) and (0,1).\nIf I go DOWN to (2,0), I eat (2,0). Next turn I can go LEFT to (1,0) (Apple) or UP to (2,1).\nIf I go LEFT to (1,1), I eat (1,1). Next turn I can go DOWN to (1,0) (Apple) or LEFT to (0,1) (Apple).\nThe net result is the same: +1 score immediately, then +1 score next turn if I choose the adjacent apple.\nHowever, (2,0) is at the edge. If I go DOWN to (2,0), my head is at the wall. My body is behind me.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,1), my head is at (1,1). My body is at (2,1).\n(2,1) is now \"safe\" empty space (mostly).\n(2,0) is occupied by nothing.\n(1,0) is occupied by nothing.\n(0,0) is occupied by nothing.\n(0,1) is occupied by nothing.\n(1,2) is occupied by nothing.\nActually, looking at the grid:\n`A A . . T T . . . A` (Row 2)\n(1,2) is 'A'. (0,2) is 'A'.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,1), I am in the middle of the apple cluster.\nIf I go DOWN to (2,0), I am at the bottom corner.\nThe bottom corner (2,0) is a bit of a dead end for movement options.\nFrom (2,0), I can only go LEFT or UP.\nFrom (1,1), I can go LEFT, DOWN, or UP (to 1,2).\n(1,2) is an apple. (0,2) is an apple.\n(1,2) is very close.\nSo (1,1) offers better future mobility and access to (1,2) which is on row 2 (clearing the top of the cluster).\n(2,0) offers access only to the bottom row.\nTherefore, **LEFT to (1,1)** is the superior strategic move for board control and mobility. It allows me to sweep the bottom row AND the row above it.\n\n**PLAN:**\nGo LEFT to (1,1) to eat the apple.\nFrom there, I will likely go DOWN to (1,0) next turn to eat that apple, then LEFT to (0,0).\nThen I can climb up to (0,1) and (0,2).\nThis clears the entire left side of the board efficiently.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Moving here means moving backwards into myself. **DEAD ON ARRIVAL.** \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **UP (1, 2):** Let's check the board. Row 2 is `A A . . T T . . . A`. (1,2) is an **Apple (A)**.

I eat an apple, score goes to 5. Safe.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI have three apples right next to me. I am in a feasting zone.\n*   Going UP to (1,2) clears the apple on the second row.\n*   Going DOWN to (1,0) clears the apple on the bottom row.\n*   Going LEFT to (0,1) clears the apple on the left edge.\n\nWhere is the enemy? (4,9) is the top wall. He is trapped.\nMy goal is to dominate the board and eat. I need to clear these apples efficiently.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I open up access to (0,2) and (2,2) next turn.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0), I open up access to (0,0) and (2,0) next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,1), I am against the wall, but I can then go DOWN to (0,0) or UP to (0,2).\n\nLet's look at the density. The bottom left is dense. (1,2) is also an apple. (0,2) is an apple.\nActually, if I go UP to (1,2), I eat (1,2).\nFrom (1,2), I can go LEFT to (0,2) (Apple) or DOWN to (1,1) (Safe, empty space now).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0), I eat (1,0).\nFrom (1,0), I can go LEFT to (0,0) (Apple) or RIGHT to (2,0) (Apple) or UP to (1,1) (Safe).\n\nBoth UP and DOWN offer immediate food and good follow-ups.\nHowever, looking at the board state:\nRow 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`\nRow 0: `A A A . . . . . . .`\n\n(1,2) is an apple. (2,2) is empty (blocked by my body or enemy? No, wait. My body is at (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). (2,2) is empty).\nActually, if I go UP to (1,2), I am eating an apple. This is good.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0), I am eating an apple. This is also good.\n\nIs there a reason to prefer one?\nThe enemy is at (4,9). He is not moving towards me.\nI am safe.\nI should prioritize moves that give me the most future flexibility.\nFrom (1,2) (UP): I can access (0,2) [Apple], (1,1) [Safe], (2,2) [Safe].\nFrom (1,0) (DOWN): I can access (0,0) [Apple], (2,0) [Apple], (1,1) [Safe].\n\nGoing UP seems slightly better because (2,2) is a safe empty space that moves me away from the wall and keeps me in the center of the board. Going DOWN to (1,0) puts me on the bottom row, which is more restrictive on the y-axis (can't go down further).\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\n`A A A . . . . . . .` (Row 0)\n`1 A . . 1 T . . A .` (Row 1)\n`A A . . T T . . . A` (Row 2)\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I eat the apple there.\nFrom (1,2), the next obvious move is LEFT to (0,2) to eat that apple, or DOWN to (1,1).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0), I eat the apple there.\nFrom (1,0), I can go LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0).\n\nActually, let's look at the immediate safety.\n(1,2) is an apple. (1,0) is an apple. (0,1) is an apple.\n(1,2) is strictly inside the cluster. (1,0) is on the bottom edge.\n(1,2) feels more central.\nAlso, notice that (0,2) and (1,2) are both apples. Clearing the top of the cluster (Row 2) might be cleaner than the bottom row (Row 0) where I am constrained by the wall at y=0.\n\nLet's go **UP**. It eats an apple and keeps me in a flexible position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (1,2). Then eat (0,2). Then clear the bottom left cluster (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) while keeping an eye on the enemy. He's stuck in the top right, so I have time.\n\nUP",

My body is trailing back to (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 9)**. Score: 7. He's still stuck in the top right corner. He is effectively boxed in by the wall and his own body.\n*   **Apple State:** I'm currently sitting on top of an apple at (1, 2)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nI'm at (1, 2). Let's look at my options:\n1.  **RIGHT (2, 2):** This is an empty cell. Safe. (2, 2) is currently unoccupied.\n2.  **LEFT (0, 2):** This is an apple (A). Valid move. I eat, score goes to 5. Safe.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 1):** This is empty. Safe.\n4.  **UP (1, 3):** This is empty. Safe.\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!** I am currently sitting on an apple at (1, 2) according to the board state. *Wait, the board state shows Row 2 as `A A . . T T . . . A`.*\n*   (0, 2) is 'A'\n*   (1, 2) is 'A'\n*   (2, 2) is '.'\n*   (3, 2) is '.'\n\nIf I am at (1, 2) and it's an 'A', I am **already** eating this turn? Or did I just move here last turn?\n*Check Last Turn:* My last move was **UP** from (1, 1) to (1, 2).\n*Check Board State:* The board state provided is for the *start* of Turn 13.\nRow 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`\nThis means (1, 2) is indeed an Apple.\n\n**Crucial Logic:** In Snake, if you move *onto* an apple, you eat it and grow. The board state represents the board *before* my move this turn.\nSince I am at (1, 2) and there is an apple there, I am currently occupying the apple. I have already eaten it (implied by the turn ending and the new turn starting). The apple at (1, 2) is technically \"gone\" or I am standing on the spot where it was.\n\nLet's re-evaluate moves from (1, 2) for this turn (Turn 13).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** (2, 2) is empty. Safe.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** (0, 2) is an Apple. Safe. Eats apple.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** (1, 1) is empty (I just moved from there, and my body has shifted). Safe.\n4.  **UP to (1, 3):** (1, 3) is empty. Safe.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI have plenty of safe moves.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Moves me toward the center of the board. From there, I can access (3, 2) or (2, 1). Good for dominating the board.\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Moves me to the wall. I eat an apple (Score 5). From (0, 2), I can only go DOWN to (0, 1) or UP to (0, 3). (0, 1) is currently an apple (check Row 1: `A T T T T . . . A .`). Wait, (0, 1) is 'A'. But my body is currently at (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1). So (0, 1) is open!\n*   **DOWN (1, 1):** Safe, but I just came from there. It keeps me in the same cluster.\n*   **UP (1, 3):** Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 9) and blocked. I have free reign of the bottom half of the board. I need to clear these apples efficiently.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (0, 2) gives me an immediate apple.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 2) keeps me flexible and central.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (1, 1) allows me to loop back to the bottom row apples (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0).\n\nHowever, looking at the board:\nRow 2: `A A . . T T . . . A`\nI am at (1, 2). If I go **RIGHT** to (2, 2), I am leaving the apple at (0, 2) on the table. But (0, 2) is right there.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0, 2), I eat the apple. From (0, 2), I can go DOWN to (0, 1) (which is also an apple).\nThat's a double apple chain: (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\nBUT, wait. (0, 1) is currently occupied by an apple. If I go to (0, 2), then next turn I can go to (0, 1). That's good.\n\nHowever, is there a risk?\nMy body is at (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0, 2):\nNext turn, I could go **DOWN** to (0, 1). (0, 1) is an apple.\nNext turn, I could go **UP** to (0, 3).\nNext turn, I could go **RIGHT** to (1, 2) (which will be empty by then).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (2, 2):\nI secure a central position. I don't get the apple at (0, 2) immediately, but I am safer generally because I'm not on the wall.\nActually, the apple at (0, 2) is currently safe. No one is near it. The enemy is at the top right (3, 9). I can come back for it.\n\n**The Play:**\nThe bottom left is dense with apples: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) are all apples.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (1, 1), I am moving back into the \"tunnel\" formed by my body. I lose vertical space.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0, 2), I am on the wall, but I am eating an apple and setting up for (0, 1).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (2, 2), I am central. I can then go DOWN to (2, 1) (Safe), LEFT to (1, 2) (Safe), UP to (2, 3) (Empty), or RIGHT to (3, 2) (Empty).\n\nWait, looking at the board state for Row 1: `A T T T T . . . A .`\n(0, 1) is 'A'. (1, 1) is 'T' (My body). (2, 1) is 'T'...\nSo (0, 1) is open! It's an apple waiting for me.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am currently at (1, 2) (Apple).\nI will move **LEFT** to (0, 2).\nWhy? Because (0, 2) is an Apple.\nFrom (0, 2), I can move **DOWN** to (0, 1) next turn (which is also an Apple). That's a guaranteed eat next turn too.\nIf I move RIGHT or UP, I am not capitalizing on the immediate apple cluster to my left.\nThe enemy is stuck. I can safely eat the left wall apples.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1.  Move **LEFT** to (0, 2) (Eat Apple, Score 5).\n2.  Next turn, move **DOWN** to (0, 1) (Eat Apple, Score 6).\n3.  Next turn, move **DOWN** to (0, 0) (Eat Apple, Score 7).\n4.  Then sweep the bottom row (1, 0) and (2, 0).\n\nLet's execute.\n\nLEFT",

Now we're looking at the board, and I gotta keep the momentum going.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(0, 1)**. Score: 6. My body extends back to (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 7)**. Score: 8. He is still trapped in the corner at the top right (3,7) surrounded by his own body (3,8, 4,9, etc.). He has limited moves.\n*   **Apple State:** There is an apple at **(0, 0)** directly below me. There is also an apple at (1, 0) and (2, 0) to the right.\n\n**2. EVALUATING MOVES (From (0, 1)):**\n\n*   **UP (0, 2):** This is currently occupied by my own body (specifically the segment that used to be my head). If I go UP, I crash into myself. **DEATH.**\n*   **LEFT (-1, 1):** Out of bounds (x < 0). **DEATH.**\n*   **RIGHT (1, 1):** Currently occupied by my own body (segment at 1,1). If I go RIGHT, I crash. **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN (0, 0):** This cell is empty (based on the board state `0 A A A . . . . . . .` where the first A is (0,0) but I am currently at (0,1) which corresponds to the second A in that row? Wait, let's check coordinates. (0,0) is Apple. (0,1) is my head. (1,1) is my body. (2,1) is my body. (3,1) is my body. (4,1) is my body. The board state shows `1 1 T T T T . . . A .` for row 1. This indicates (0,1) is part of the snake. (1,1) is T (body). (2,1) is T (body). (3,1) is T (body). (4,1) is T (body). (5,1) is empty. (6,1) empty. (7,1) empty. (8,1) Apple. (9,1) empty. Row 0 is `A A A . . . . . . .` so (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) are apples. Moving **DOWN** to (0,0) moves me onto an apple. It is safe because (0,0) is not occupied by any body segment. **SAFE.**\n\n**3. STRATEGY & ANALYSIS:**\nI am completely boxed in on the top, left, and right sides by my own body! The *only* legal move that doesn't result in immediate suicide is **DOWN**.\nMoving down to (0,0) gives me another apple (Score 7). From (0,0), I will be at the bottom-left corner.\n*   From (0,0) next turn, I can go RIGHT to (1,0) (Apple) or UP to (0,1) (which will be empty since I'm leaving it).\n*   This keeps me safe and continues to grow my score.\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is at (3,7). He is trapped in a box of his own body (to the North, East, and West are blocked by his own segments or the wall). He likely has to move South to (3,6). (3,6) is currently a 'T' (snake body). Wait, looking at the board:\nRow 6: `. . . A T T T . . A`\n(3,6) is 'A'? No, let's look closer.\nRow 6: `6 . . . A T T T . . A`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: ., 2: ., 3: A, 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: ., 8: ., 9: A.\nWait, the Enemy is at (3,7).\nRow 7: `7 . . A 0 T . . . . .`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: ., 2: A, 3: 0 (Enemy Head), 4: T (Enemy Body), 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: ., 9: .\nIf Enemy is at (3,7), looking at his body: (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6).\nHe is surrounded. If he moves DOWN to (3,6), let's check row 6: (3,6) is actually an Apple (Index 3 is A in row 6 description provided? Wait, the board text says `6 . . . A T T T . . A`. So (3,6) is an Apple? Or is it empty?\nLet's re-read the board provided:\n`6 . . . A T T T . . A`\nLet's parse this carefully.\nColumn 0: .\nColumn 1: .\nColumn 2: .\nColumn 3: A (Apple)\nColumn 4: T (Snake Body)\nColumn 5: T (Snake Body)\nColumn 6: T (Snake Body)\nColumn 7: .\nColumn 8: .\nColumn 9: A\n\nIf Enemy Head is at (3,7), and his body is at (3,8), (3,9)...\nWait, the Enemy body list is: `[(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]`.\nSo (3,6) is NOT in his body list.\nHowever, (3,6) is an Apple according to the board representation above.\nIf the Enemy moves DOWN to (3,6), he eats an apple and grows.\nBut wait, (3,6) is shown as 'A' on the board. If he eats it, he grows.\nIs (3,6) safe for him? Yes, it's an apple.\nBut let's look at his other options. He is at (3,7).\nUp (3,8) is his body. Blocked.\nLeft (2,7) is empty? Row 7: `7 . . A 0 T . . . . .` Index 2 is A. Index 3 is 0. Index 4 is T. So (2,7) is Apple.\nRight (4,7) is his body (specifically 4,7 is in his body list). Blocked.\nDown (3,6) is Apple (based on board).\nSo he can go Left to (2,7) or Down to (3,6).\nIf he goes Left to (2,7), he eats an apple.\nIf he goes Down to (3,6), he eats an apple.\n\nHe is not dead yet, but he is restricted. I am safe to take my apple.\n\n**4. PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (0,0). Get score 7. Secure the bottom-left corner. Prepare to sweep the bottom row (1,0) and (2,0).\n\n**5. LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:**\n*Enemy is cornered but still has apples to eat at (2,7) or (3,6). He will likely grow. I need to maximize my own growth to maintain the lead. I will sweep the bottom row (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)->... then maybe move up the right side to avoid him, or cut him off if he tries to escape. My immediate priority is avoiding self-collision and securing the free food below.*\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I'm growing, but hold up\u2014I need to check the board state because things just got spicy. The enemy is still trapped at (3, 6) now? Let's map this out!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(0, 0)**. Score: 7.\n    *   **Body:** `[(0, 0) is Head? Wait, let's look at the list provided]`\n    *   **Provided Body List:** `[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`\n    *   *Self-Correction:* Wait, the prompt says my Head is (0,0) in the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section, but the body list starts with (0,1). This implies I moved to (0,0) from (0,1).\n    *   **Actual Current Body (Head to Tail):**\n        1.  Head: (0, 0)\n        2.  (0, 1)\n        3.  (0, 2)\n        4.  (1, 2)\n        5.  (1, 1)\n        6.  (2, 1)\n        7.  (3, 1)\n        8.  (4, 1)\n    *   *Visual Check:* I am stacked vertically on the far left (x=0) and then a little blob on row 1 and 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 6)**. Score: 9.\n    *   **Body:** `[(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]`\n    *   **Position:** He moved down from (3, 7) to (3, 6). He likely ate the apple at (3, 6) because the board text shows (3, 6) as 'A' previously. Wait, looking at the board text provided in the prompt:\n        `6 . . . A T T T . . A`\n        Column 3 is 'A', Column 4 is 'T', Column 5 is 'T', Column 6 is 'T'.\n        So (3, 6) was an Apple. If he is at (3, 6) and ate it, his score is now 10.\n    *   *Threat Assessment:* He is still somewhat contained but expanding down into the open space. He has apples available at (2, 6) or (1, 6) potentially, or he might try to loop around.\n\n**2. EVALUATING MOVES (From (0, 0)):**\n\nI am at the bottom-left corner `(0, 0)`.\n*   **UP (0, 1):** This is my current body segment (the neck). If I go UP, I move into my own body. **DEATH.**\n*   **LEFT (-1, 0):** Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN (0, -1):** Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n*   **RIGHT (1, 0):** Let's check the board state.\n    *   Row 0: `0 A A A . . . . . . .`\n    *   Indices: 0: '1' (My Head), 1: 'A' (Apple), 2: 'A' (Apple), 3: 'A' (Apple), 4: '.', etc.\n    *   Target Cell: (1, 0) is an Apple.\n    *   Is it occupied? No. My body is at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), etc. (1,0) is clear.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. Moves me to (1, 0). I eat an apple. Score becomes 8.\n\n**3. STRATEGY & ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Forced Move:** Literally the ONLY legal move is RIGHT to (1, 0). I am boxed in on 3 sides (Down, Left, Up).\n*   **The Apple Feast:** Row 0 is full of apples. I need to sweep this row immediately. `(0,0)` -> `(1,0)` -> `(2,0)` -> `(3,0)` -> ... This is pure content and growth.\n*   **Enemy Position:** The enemy is at `(3, 6)`. He is in the middle of the board.\n    *   *Predicting Enemy Move:* He is surrounded by his own body to the North and East. To the West is `(2, 6)` (which is empty or an apple, looking at row 6 text: `. . . A T T T . . A` -> index 2 is `.`). To the South is `(3, 5)` (which is empty or an apple? Row 5: `. . . A . . . A . . .` -> index 3 is `A`).\n    *   If he goes `(2, 6)`, he clears space. If he goes `(3, 5)`, he gets closer to the bottom but away from his tail momentarily.\n    *   *Crucial Note:* I am safe on the bottom row. The enemy is on row 6. We are far apart. Collision is impossible this turn unless he tries a crazy jump (which he can't). I can safely farm the bottom row without fear of immediate head-on collision.\n\n**4. PLAN:**\nEat the apples on the bottom row `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0)` etc. This builds my score to match or exceed his (currently 9 or 10). While I'm farming the bottom, the enemy might stay trapped or try to escape. I'll watch his movement. If he comes down, I'll be ready to cut him off once I've cleared the bottom row.\n\n**5. LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\n*Farm the bottom row `x=0 to 9`. My body will stretch out horizontally. Once I hit `x=9`, I'll have a long horizontal line. I need to turn up `y=1` and avoid running into my own tail. The enemy is stuck in a loop above. I will dominate the board space.*\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Moving backwards into my own body is not allowed. **DEATH.**\n   * **RIGHT (2, 0):** Let's check the board.\n     * Board row 0: `0 T A A . . . . . . .` (Wait, looking at the text provided in the prompt: `0 T 1 A . . . . . . .` - no that's the previous turn board state. The current turn board state is below it).\n     * Current Board Row 0: `0 1 A . . . . . . . .`\n     * Indices: 0: '1' (Me), 1: 'A' (Apple), 2: 'A' (Apple), 3: '.'

Let's break down the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n    *   **My Snake:** Head at **(2, 0)**. Score: 9. Length: 10 (Head + 9 Body segments).\n    *   **Body List:** `[(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(2, 5)**. Score: 10. Length: 11. He's directly above me, separated by the wall of my body at `(2, 1)` and empty space.\n\n2.  **EVALUATING MOVES (From (2, 0)):**\n    *   **UP (2, 1):** Let's check. My body list shows `(2, 1)` is occupied. If I go UP, I hit my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **DOWN (2, -1):** y = -1 is off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **LEFT (1, 0):** My body list shows `(1, 0)` is occupied (my neck). Moving backwards into my own body is illegal. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udca5\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 0):**\n        *   Current Board Row 0: `0 T T 1 . . . . . .` (Wait, looking at the visual map: `0 T T 1 A . . . . .`). The prompt shows `0 1 A . . . . . . . .` in the board state description, but the visual ASCII art is usually the source of truth. Let's check the ASCII art row 0: `0 1 A A . . . . . .` (Indices 0-9). I am at index 2 ('1'). Target is index 3 ('A').\n        *   Is `(3, 0)` occupied? No.\n        *   Is it an apple? Yes, there's an apple at `(3, 0)` based on the board state description and the logic of sweeping the row.\n        *   **Result:** Safe. I move to `(3, 0)` and eat an apple. Score becomes 10.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY & ANALYSIS:**\n    *   **Forced Move:** Just like last turn, I am pinned on the bottom row. My body is blocking Left and Up, the wall blocks Down. The **only** legal move is **RIGHT**.\n    *   **The Squeeze:** The enemy is at `(2, 5)`. He's likely going for the cluster of apples above him or eyeing the center. He is physically blocked from reaching me by the bottom wall and my own body length. If he tries to rush down, he'll likely hit my tail or run into me.\n    *   **Scoring:** Moving to `(3, 0)` gets me that apple. Score is now 10. I have tied the score. This is crucial for the \"higher score\" aggression rule later.\n    *   **Future Position:** I will be at `(3, 0)`. The next move will likely be to `(4, 0)`, then `(5, 0)`, etc. I am clearing the bottom row efficiently.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue the bottom row sweep. I am building a massive wall. Once I reach `x=9` and turn UP, I will effectively cut the board in half horizontally. The enemy is currently above my body wall at y=1. I am trapping him in the upper half while I consume the resources below. Once I tie the score (which happens this turn), I look for opportunities to force a head-on collision on my terms.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI am literally forced to go RIGHT. No other option exists that doesn't result in instant death. Let's eat that apple.\n\nRIGHT",

No risk of a head\u2011on collision this turn.  \n\n**Legal directions for me**  \n| Direction | Target cell | Occupied? | Apple? | Verdict |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|\n| **UP**    | (2,\u202f5)      | My own body (segment) | \u2013 | Illegal (self\u2011collision) |\n| **DOWN**  | (2,\u202f3)      | Empty | \u2705 Apple (2,\u202f3) | \u2705 Safe, +1 apple, growth gives extra reach |\n| **LEFT**  | (1,\u202f4)      | Empty | \u2013 | \u2705 Safe, opens a lane toward the left\u2011hand apple line |\n| **RIGHT** | (3,\u202f4)      | Empty | \u2013 | \u2705 Safe, keeps us near the vertical wall of our own body |\n\n**Why DOWN is the best choice right now**  \n\n1. **Immediate apple** \u2013 (2,\u202f3) is an apple, so we extend our lead to 12\u202fvs\u202f9.  \n2. **Maintain pressure** \u2013 staying in column\u202f2 keeps us directly above the opponent\u2019s corridor (they\u2019re stuck moving right along the bottom). As they climb up later, we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off.  \n3. **Future freedom** \u2013 after eating, we\u2019ll still have three viable exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN into (2,\u202f2) for another apple). No dead\u2011end.  \n4. **No collision risk** \u2013 opponent\u2019s sole move goes to (4,\u202f0), far from our target.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n- **Turn\u202f19**:\u202fDOWN \u2192 eat (2,\u202f3).  \n- **Turn\u202f20**: Likely DOWN again to (2,\u202f2) for the next apple, then swing LEFT toward (1,\u202f2)/(0,\u202f2) to start hemming the rival as they try to rise.  \n- Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s upward move; when they finally go UP, we\u2019ll be ready to meet them head\u2011on with our higher score.\n\n**Move**:  \n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! Turn 19 and the tension is REAL! We're tied at 9 apples each, and that enemy snake is lurking at (2, 4) directly above me. He's hungry, but so am I. Let's break down the grid.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n    *   **My Snake:** Head at **(3, 0)**. Score: 10 (I ate the apple last turn! LET'S GOOO!). Length: 11 (Head + 10 Body segments).\n    *   **Body List:** `[(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(2, 4)**. Score: 11. Length: 11. He is directly above me. He is a threat.\n\n2.  **EVALUATING MOVES (From (3, 0)):**\n    *   **UP (3, 1):** My body list shows `(3, 1)` is occupied. If I go UP, I hit my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **DOWN (3, -1):** y = -1 is off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 0):**\n        *   Checking board state. Row 0: `T T T 1 . . . . . .` (My head is at 3). Is `(4, 0)` occupied? The ASCII shows `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` grid.\n        *   Row 0: `T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n        *   Index 4 is a dot `.`. It's empty.\n        *   Is it an apple? No visible apple at (4,0) in the list.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 0):**\n        *   Checking board state. Row 0: `T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n        *   Index 2 is a `T` (Tail). But wait, looking at my body list, `(2, 0)` is the second segment of my body. It is occupied by *me*.\n        *   Moving into my own body = **DEATH.** \ud83d\udca5\n\n3.  **THE TRAP & THE SQUEEZE:**\n    *   I am pinned to the bottom row again. Left is blocked by my own body. Up is blocked by my own body. Down is death.\n    *   **I am forced to go RIGHT.**\n    *   However, I need to look at the enemy. He is at (2, 4). He has apples at (2, 3) and (2, 2) nearby. He might try to dive down to eat the apple at (2, 3) or (3, 4) or (4, 4). If he goes DOWN to (2, 3), he enters the row just above my neck.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (4, 0), I am safe for now. I am building my wall. My tail will shift from (4,1) to (3,1)? No, my tail is at (4,1) currently? Wait. My body list is `[(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`.\n    *   Tail is (4,1). Head is (3,0).\n    *   If I move Right to (4,0):\n        *   New Head: (4,0).\n        *   New Body: (3,0), (2,0), (1,0)... (4,1) becomes the second to last? No, the tail (4,1) moves to follow (3,1).\n    *   **Strategy:** I am creating a horizontal barrier. The enemy is above me. If I keep moving right, I keep him trapped in the upper half of the board (y > 0). This is exactly what I want. I want to box him in.\n    *   I currently have a higher score (10 vs 11? No, scoreboard says: My snake apples: 9, Snake #0 apples: 11. WAIT.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:**\n        *   **My Score:** 9 (pre-move). I ate an apple at (3,0) last turn? My last move rationale said \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point.\"\n        *   My last move was RIGHT to (3, 0).\n        *   Looking at the board state ASCII: Row 0: `0 1 A A . . . . . .` (Indices 0-9). Wait, the visual map shows:\n            ```\n             9 A . . T T . . . .\n             ...\n             0 T T T 1 . . . . . .\n            ```\n            But the prompt text says: `BOARD STATE: ... 0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n            And `APPLE DROPS: (8, 1), (9, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (9, 6), (2, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 8), (0, 4), (9, 1), (0, 9), (2, 2)`\n            And `YOUR SNAKE ... Apples collected: 9`\n            And `OPPONENTS ... Apples: 11`\n        *   **Wait!** Did I eat an apple last turn? My rationale said \"Target is index 3 ('A')\". But the *Updated Board State* for THIS turn shows: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .` at index 3. There is no 'A' at (3,0) in the current visual.\n        *   **Reality Check:** The apple drop list is full. The board state provided *this turn* is the result of the previous turn's moves.\n        *   My head is at (3,0).\n        *   My body is at (2,0), (1,0)...\n        *   **Did I actually eat?** The board state provided *this turn* shows `(3, 0)` as my head '1'. It does *not* show an apple there. The apple list provided doesn't explicitly say which apples are on the board right now vs history, but the ASCII art is the source of truth.\n        *   **Wait.** My last move was RIGHT. My old head was (2,0). I moved to (3,0).\n        *   Was there an apple at (3,0)? The current board state says: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .` (Indices 0-9).\n        *   Actually, looking at the ASCII in the prompt: Row 0 is `0 1 A A . . . . . .` in the user's visualization? No, let's look at the prompt again.\n        *   `Board size: 10x10.`\n        *   `YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (3, 0)`\n        *   `OPPONENTS: ... Snake #0 - Head: (2, 4)`\n        *   `BOARD STATE:`\n        *   `9 A . . T T . . . .`\n        *   `...`\n        *   `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n        *   `  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n        *   **There is NO apple at (3,0) in the current state.**\n        *   **My Score is 9.**\n        *   **Enemy Score is 11.**\n        *   **I am behind by 2 apples.**\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating Moves with Score in Mind:**\n        *   **UP (3, 1):** Occupied. Death.\n        *   **DOWN:** Death.\n        *   **LEFT (2, 0):** Occupied (my body). Death.\n        *   **RIGHT (4, 0):**\n            *   Is it safe? Yes, empty space.\n            *   Does it get me an apple? No.\n            *   **Strategic Value:** I am at (3,0). If I move RIGHT to (4,0), I continue my sweep. I am trapping the enemy above me. However, I need apples to win.\n            *   Where are the apples?\n            *   (4, 4)? (6, 3)? (2, 3)? (2, 2)?\n            *   The enemy is at (2, 4). He is close to (2, 3) and (2, 2).\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (4, 0), I am safe.\n            *   Is there *any* other move?\n            *   No. I am hard pinned.\n            *   **Wait, look at the ASCII art again carefully.**\n            *   Row 0: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n            *   Indices: 0:'T', 1:'T', 2:'T', 3:'1', 4:'.', 5:'.', etc.\n            *   My head is at (3,0).\n            *   My body is at (2,0), (1,0), (0,0).\n            *   **I am forced to go RIGHT.**\n\n4.  **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    *   I must move RIGHT to (4, 0).\n    *   I am creating a blockade. The enemy is at y=4. I am at y=0. I am boxing him into the upper half.\n    *   I need to find apples. The apple at (4,4) is interesting. But first, I must survive.\n    *   Since I am forced, I commit to the sweep.\n    *   **Wait, is there a way to get an apple sooner?** No. The only safe move is (4,0).\n    *   **Wait, look at the enemy.** He is at (2,4). He might go DOWN to (2,3) to get an apple. If he does, he will be at y=3. My head will be at (4,0).\n    *   If he goes DOWN, he doesn't hit me. My body is at y=0 and y=1 mostly.\n    *   However, if he goes DOWN to (2,3), and I go RIGHT to (4,0), the distance increases.\n    *   **Aggression Check:** Score is 9 vs 11. I am losing. I need to eat.\n    *   Is there a risky move? No, risks mean death.\n    *   **Wait, look at the board state again.**\n    *   Row 0: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n    *   Row 1: `1 T T T T . . . . . .`\n    *   Row 2: `2 T T A . . . . . . A`\n    *   Row 3: `3 . . A . . . A . . .`\n    *   Row 4: `4 A . 0 . . . A A . .`\n    *   Enemy head is at (2,4).\n    *   I am at (3,0).\n    *   My only safe move is RIGHT.\n    *   **Wait!** Look at Row 2. `(2, 2)` is an Apple `A`. `(2, 3)` is an Apple `A`.\n    *   My body is at `(1, 2)` and `(0, 2)` and `(1, 1)`.\n    *   If I could go UP, I'd die.\n    *   If I could go LEFT, I'd die.\n    *   I am forced RIGHT.\n    *   **Strategy:** I am playing the long game. I am building a wall. The enemy is trapped above. I will eventually turn up and hunt him down.\n    *   **Wait, look at the apple at (0, 4) in the drop list.**\n    *   The board state shows `4 A . 0 . . . A A . .`\n    *   (0, 4) is `A` (Leftmost column).\n    *   My body occupies the entire left side `(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)`.\n    *   The apple at (0,4) is actually accessible? No, because my body is at (0,3)? No, (0,3) is not in my body list.\n    *   My body list: `[(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`\n    *   (0, 3) is empty. (0, 4) is an apple.\n    *   **But I cannot reach (0,4) because I am pinned to the bottom right.**\n    *   **Wait.** Is there *any* way to get an apple *this turn*?\n    *   No. The only safe cell is (4, 0). It has no apple.\n    *   **Wait.** Am I reading the board right?\n    *   Row 0: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n    *   Indices: 0, 1, 2 are T. 3 is 1.\n    *   Indices 4, 5, 6... are dots.\n    *   (4,0) is a dot.\n    *   **I must move RIGHT.**\n\n5.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    *   Move: RIGHT.\n    *   Reason: It is the *only* move that doesn't kill me immediately.\n    *   Strategy: Continue the sweep. Trap the enemy. Wait for an opening to cut across the board.\n    *   Score: 9 vs 11. I am behind. I need to be patient.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinuing the bottom row sweep to the right. I am building a vertical wall that will eventually cut the board in half horizontally. The enemy is currently in the upper half (y>=2). I need to secure the right side of the board and then turn upwards to trap him against the right wall or force a collision when I have more length.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is lurking at (2, 3) directly above our head, and the map is getting TIGHT. Let's break down the grid.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n    *   **My Snake:** Head at **(4, 0)** (Just moved there!). Score: 9. Length: 11.\n    *   **Body List:** `[(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(2, 3)**. Score: 12. Length: 12. He is dangerous.\n\n2.  **EVALUATING MOVES (From (4, 0)):**\n    *   **UP (4, 1):** Checking my body list. Yes, `(4, 1)` is the tail (last item in the list: `..., (3, 1)]`? Wait, the list ends at `(3,1)`. Let me look at the board state.\n        *   Board Row 1: `1 T T T T . . . . . .`\n        *   Indices 0-3 are T's. Index 4 is a `.`.\n        *   Wait, my body list is `[(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)]`.\n        *   `(4, 1)` is **NOT** in my body list.\n        *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN (4, -1):** y = -1. Off the board. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 0):**\n        *   Board Row 0: `0 T T T 1 . . . . . .`\n        *   Index 5 is a `.`.\n        *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 0):**\n        *   Checking my body list. `(3, 0)` is the **FIRST** item in the list (right behind my head).\n        *   If I move Left, I move into my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udca5\n\n3.  **THE TRAP & THE SQUEEZE:**\n    *   I have two safe moves: **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy is at (2, 3). He has apples at (2, 2) and (2, 7) and (7, 4) nearby. He is \"above\" me. If I go UP to (4, 1), I am moving towards him.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   If I go UP to (4, 1), I am vertical. The enemy is at x=2.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (5, 0), I am horizontal at the bottom.\n    *   **The Score:** 9 vs 12. I am behind. I need to be aggressive, but not stupid.\n    *   **Board Geometry:** The right side of the board (x=5 through 9) is mostly empty. The left side is cluttered with my body.\n    *   **The Box-In Strategy:**\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (5, 0), I am sweeping the bottom row. I am forcing the enemy to stay in the upper half (y > 0) because I am securing the bottom edge.\n        *   If I go UP to (4, 1), I am entering the \"danger zone\" where the enemy is.\n    *   **Which move gives me more options?**\n        *   If I go RIGHT (5,0): Next turn I can potentially go UP to (5,1) or continue RIGHT. This keeps the bottom row open.\n        *   If I go UP (4,1): I am moving into my own body's path. My body is at (3,1). If I go UP, my tail will shift, but I am essentially \"turning\" the corner.\n    *   **Wait, look at the Board State:**\n        *   Row 1: `1 T T T T . . . . . .`\n        *   Row 2: `2 T T A . . . . . . A`\n        *   The enemy is at (2,3).\n        *   If I go UP to (4,1), I am safe. But next turn, if the enemy moves DOWN to (2,2) or (2,1), he gets closer.\n        *   However, if I go RIGHT to (5,0), I am widening the gap.\n    *   **Apple Check:** Are there any apples I can reach?\n        *   (5,0)? No apple.\n        *   (4,1)? No apple.\n        *   (6,3) is an apple, but far away.\n    *   **Strategic Positioning:**\n        *   The enemy is at (2,3). He is confined to the left/center top.\n        *   By going RIGHT to (5,0), I am claiming the bottom-right corner.\n        *   If I go UP, I am moving into the center.\n    *   **Wait, look at the board layout again.**\n        *   `9 A . . T T . . . .`\n        *   `8 . . . T T . . A . .`\n        *   `7 . . A T T . . . . .`\n        *   `6 . . . T T T . . . A`\n        *   `5 . . T T . . A . . .`\n        *   `4 A . 0 . . . A A . .` (Enemy head at 2,3)\n        *   `3 . . A . . . A . . .`\n        *   `2 T T A . . . . A . A`\n        *   `1 T T T T . . . . . .`\n        *   `0 T T T T 1 . . . . .`\n        *   I am at (4,0).\n        *   The enemy is at (2,3).\n        *   If I go UP, I move to (4,1). My tail (3,1) moves to (3,2)? No, my tail is at (3,1) currently.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I move to (5,0). My tail (3,1) moves?\n    *   **The Winning Move:**\n        *   I need to secure the right side.\n        *   If I go UP, I am cutting off my own escape route to the bottom right.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I keep the bottom row open. I can always turn up later.\n        *   The enemy is at y=3. I am at y=0. I am safe for now.\n        *   **Aggression:** To box him in, I need to control the perimeter. The bottom row is safe. The right wall is safe.\n        *   **Decision:** Go RIGHT. Secure the space. The enemy is occupied with the apple at (2,2) or (2,7). Let him eat. I need to get to the (6,3) or (7,4) apples safely.\n\n4.  **LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    *   Move RIGHT to (5,0).\n    *   Continue sweeping the bottom edge to the right.\n    *   Secure the right wall (x=9).\n    *   Once the right side is secured, turn UP and sweep upwards, trapping the enemy against the top or left wall.\n    *   Wait for the enemy to make a mistake or overcommit to an apple.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

They are currently safe. They are likely looking at the apple at (2, 7) or moving towards the center. They are NOT threatening me directly right now.\n    *   **The Box-In Plan:**\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 0), I am continuing my sweep of the bottom edge. This is the \"Safe Path.\" It keeps me away from the enemy.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (5, 1), I am moving into the center of the board. While safe, I am moving closer to the enemy's territory.\n    *   **Score Disadvantage:** 9 vs 13. I need apples.\n    *   **Apple Check:**\n        *   Going **RIGHT** to (6, 0): No apple here. But it positions me near the bottom-right corner where apples like (7, 2) and (9, 1) are accessible.\n        *   Going **UP** to (5, 1): No apple here. It puts me directly between my own body and potential enemy movement.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** (6,0): Next turn I can continue RIGHT to (7,0) or turn UP to (6,1). This keeps the bottom row open as an escape route.\n        *   If I go UP (5,1): I am entering the \"filled\" area. My tail moves, but I lose the bottom row access immediately.\n\n4.  **THE DECISION:**\n    *   The enemy is distracted in the top-left quadrant.\n    *   I need to secure the bottom-right quadrant to maximize my space.\n    *   Moving RIGHT keeps me on the bottom edge, maintaining a long, open corridor for future movement. It forces the enemy to stay above me (y > 0) if they want to avoid a collision.\n    *   Let's keep sweeping right. Dominate the perimeter.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the bottom row all the way to x=9. Once the bottom is claimed, turn UP and sweep the right wall upwards. Trap the enemy in the top-left corner. Force them to choke.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 22 and the pressure is ON! \ud83d\udd25 We're sitting pretty at (6, 0) after that slick RIGHT move, but the enemy has a 13-9 lead and we need to start closing that gap. Let's break down the grid.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n    *   **My Snake:** Head at **(6, 0)**. Score: 9.\n    *   **Body:** `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(3, 2)**. Score: 13.\n    *   **Observation:** I am on the bottom row, sweeping right. The enemy is still lurking in the top-left quadrant. They are safe.\n\n2.  **EVALUATING MOVES (From (6, 0)):**\n    *   **UP (6, 1):** Checking the board state. Row 1 shows `1 T . . . . A . . A A`. Index 6 is a `.` (empty).\n        *   Checking my body list: `(6, 1)` is NOT present.\n        *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN (6, -1):** y = -1. Off the board. **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 0):** Board Row 0: `0 T T T T T T 1 . . .`. Index 7 is a `.`.\n        *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 0):** My body list shows `(5, 0)` is the *first* segment immediately behind my head.\n        *   Moving Left moves my head into my own body. **DEATH.**\n\n3.  **THE STRATEGY:**\n    *   I have two safe moves: **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy is at (3, 2). They are far away. No immediate head-on collision threat unless they make a wild dash down.\n    *   **The Box-In Plan:**\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** to (7, 0), I continue the bottom sweep. This keeps me safe on the edge.\n        *   If I go **UP** to (6, 1), I step off the bottom row. Looking at Row 1, there's an apple at (6, 1)?? Wait, looking at the board representation:\n            *   Row 1: `1 T . . . . A . . A A`\n            *   Let's map that:\n            *   (0,1): T\n            *   (1,1): T\n            *   (2,1): .\n            *   (3,1): .\n            *   (4,1): .\n            *   (5,1): .\n            *   (6,1): A\n            *   (7,1): .\n            *   (8,1): A\n            *   (9,1): A\n            *   **HOL UP!** There is an apple at **(6, 1)**!\n    *   **Score Disadvantage:** 9 vs 13. I need apples.\n    *   **Apple Check:**\n        *   Going **RIGHT** to (7, 0): No apple here. (Apple list has (7,2), (7,4), (7,8), (7,9)).\n        *   Going **UP** to (6, 1): **APPLE CONFIRMED!** This is massive. I need to close the gap.\n    *   **Future Options:**\n        *   If I go **UP** to (6, 1): I eat the apple, grow, and position myself to move right toward (7, 2) or (8, 1).\n        *   If I go **RIGHT** (7, 0): I gain distance but no points. The enemy is eating apples elsewhere.\n\n4.  **THE DECISION:**\n    *   The math is simple. I am losing. I need points.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (6, 1) secures an apple immediately.\n    *   Is it safe? The cell is empty. The enemy is at (3, 2). They can't reach (6, 1) this turn.\n    *   I must eat to compete.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (6, 1). Then sweep the bottom-right quadrant (7, 0) next turn if safe, or pivot to the apples at (7, 2) or (8, 1). Dominate the right side.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Yes, empty. No self collision.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY & FUTURE PLANNING:**\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy head is at (3, 3). They are far away. No immediate collision threat.\n    *   **Apple Focus:**\n        *   Moving **UP** to (6, 2) puts me on an empty space, but I'm moving away from the cluster of apples on Row 1 (specifically (7,2) and (8,1) area).\n        *   Moving **LEFT** to (5, 1) keeps me low. There's an apple at (5, 1) listed in the apple drops!\n        *   Looking at the Apple List: `(5, 1)` is listed.\n        *   Wait, looking at the board state for Row 1: `(5, 1)` shows as `.` in the text grid provided, but the Apple List says `(5, 1)` exists. The text grid might be pre-move or slightly off, but I must trust the Apple List provided in the prompt.\n        *   **Apple at (5, 1)!** This is a guaranteed point if I move LEFT.\n        *   **Apple at (7, 2)!** (Row 2, Index 7 is A). This is also reachable.\n        *   **Apple at (8, 1)!** (Row 1, Index 8 is A). Reachable via RIGHT.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   **UP (6, 2):** Moves into open space. No apple immediate gratification.\n        *   **RIGHT (7, 1):** Moves into open space. No immediate apple, but pivots toward (7, 2) and (8, 1) for next turn.\n        *   **LEFT (5, 1):** Moves into `(5, 1)`. The Apple List confirms this is an apple drop.\n    *   **The Play:**\n        *   I need to close the score gap (13 vs 9). Taking an apple is priority.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** to (5, 1) guarantees an apple. This grows me to length 11 and score 10.\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** or **UP** delays the apple.\n        *   However, looking at the board layout:\n            *   If I go LEFT to (5, 1), I am adjacent to my own body at (6, 0) and (5, 0).\n            *   If I go RIGHT to (7, 1), I open up paths to (7, 2) and (8, 1).\n        *   Wait, let's re-read the board carefully.\n            *   Row 1: `T . . . . . A . . A`\n            *   Indices: 0=T, 1=., 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=A, 7=., 8=., 9=A.\n            *   This contradicts the Apple List containing (5,1).\n            *   **Conflict Resolution:** The prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ... (5, 1)\". The board state is a snapshot. Usually, the apple list is the source of truth for available fruit.\n            *   If the board shows a `.` but the list says there's an apple, I should go for the apple.\n            *   BUT, looking at the board again, maybe the indices are shifted or I'm misreading.\n            *   Let's assume the `APPLE DROPS` list is the definitive truth of where fruit is *currently* available.\n            *   If (5, 1) is an apple, **LEFT** is the move.\n        *   *However*, let's look at the enemy. They are at (3, 3). They are moving. I am at (6, 1).\n        *   If I go **RIGHT (7, 1)**:\n            *   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple at (8, 1) confirmed in list).\n            *   Or go UP to (7, 2) (Apple at (7, 2) confirmed in list).\n        *   If I go **LEFT (5, 1)**:\n            *   I eat the apple.\n            *   Next turn I am at (5, 1). My body is [(6, 1), (6, 0), ...].\n            *   I can go UP to (5, 2). Board shows (5, 2) is `.`.\n            *   I can go LEFT to (4, 1). Board shows (4, 1) is `.`.\n            *   I can go DOWN to (5, 0). Board shows (5, 0) is `T` (my body). Blocked.\n        *   **Comparison:**\n            *   **LEFT (5, 1):** Secure apple NOW. Score 10. Safe move. Future options: UP, LEFT.\n            *   **RIGHT (7, 1):** No apple NOW. Score 9. Safe move. Future options: RIGHT (to 8,1 apple), UP (to 7,2 apple), DOWN (to 7,0 empty).\n            *   **UP (6, 2):** No apple NOW. Score 9. Safe move. Future options: RIGHT (7,2 apple), UP (6,3).\n\n    *   **Final Decision Logic:**\n        *   I am losing 13-9. I need points.\n        *   The Apple List explicitly includes (5, 1).\n        *   The Board Text shows (5, 1) as empty.\n        *   *Risky* to assume the text is wrong, but the prompt specifically lists (5, 1) as a drop.\n        *   Let's look at the Board State again carefully.\n            *   Row 1: `1 T . . . . A . . A A` (Wait, the prompt had `1 T . . . . A . . A A` in the visual, but the text block is `1 T . . . . A . . A A`? No, the text block is:\n            ```\n             9 A . . T T . .

The apple was there. I ate it.)\n            *   (7,1): 1 (My head is at 6,1 currently in the *previous* turn. The board state is updated to show my head position.)\n            *   Wait, the board shows my head at (6, 1) in the description, but the visual grid shows `1` at the coordinates corresponding to my head?\n            *   Visual Row 1: `1 T . . . . A 1 . A A`\n            *   Indices: 0=T, 1=., 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=A, 7=1, 8=., 9=A.\n            *   Wait, the prompt says: \"Head: (6, 1)\".\n            *   Visual grid: `1 T . . . . A 1 . A A` (Indices 0-9).\n            *   (6,1) is 'A'. (7,1) is '1'.\n            *   This means the visual grid is slightly offset or I'm looking at it wrong.\n            *   Let's map the visual row 1 to coordinates (x, 1).\n            *   (0,1): T\n            *   (1,1): .\n            *   (2,1): .\n            *   (3,1): .\n            *   (4,1): .\n            *   (5,1): .\n            *   (6,1): A\n            *   (7,1): 1\n            *   (8,1): .\n            *   (9,1): A\n            *   **AHA!** The Visual Board shows an Apple at **(6, 1)**.\n            *   But wait, the *previous turn* I moved UP to (6, 1) and ate the apple.\n            *   The board state provided is the state *after* my move?\n            *   No, the board state provided is the state for *this* turn (Turn 23).\n            *   If I am at (6, 1) and there is an 'A' at (6, 1), that implies I haven't eaten it yet, or the visual is sticky.\n            *   Let's look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list. It contains (6, 1)? No, it contains (8, 1), (9, 2), (7, 4), (6, 3), (9, 6), (7, 2), (2, 7), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 8), (0, 4), (9, 1), (0, 9), (7, 9), (5, 1).\n            *   (6, 1) is NOT in the apple list.\n            *   Therefore, the 'A' at (6, 1) in the visual grid is likely the apple I *just* ate last turn, and the board visual hasn't updated perfectly, OR it's a different apple.\n            *   *Wait*, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ... (5, 1)\". (5, 1) IS in the list.\n            *   Visual Row 1 shows (5, 1) as `.` (empty).\n            *   This is confusing.\n            *   Let's trust the **Apple Drops List** provided at the top. It is the most explicit instruction on where fruit is.\n            *   List: (5, 1) is present.\n            *   List: (8, 1) is present.\n            *   List: (7, 2) is present.\n            *   List: (6, 1) is NOT present.\n            *   So, (6, 1) is empty (I ate it).\n            *   (5, 1) is an apple.\n            *   (7, 1) is empty (Visual shows `1` which is my head visual, but usually the board shows static objects. Let's assume (7, 1) is empty space around my head).\n            *   (6, 2) is empty (Visual shows `.`).\n            *   (7, 2) is an apple (List says so, Visual shows `.` at (7,2)? No, Visual Row 2: `2 T . T T . . . A . A`. (7,2) is 'A'. Correct.\n            *   (8, 1) is an apple (List says so, Visual Row 1: (8,1) is '.'). Mismatch again.\n            *   Okay, I must assume the **Apple List** is the ground truth for fruit locations, and the **Visual Board** is the ground truth for walls/snakes/empty space.\n            *   If the Apple List says (5, 1) is an apple, and the Visual Board says (5, 1) is `.`, I should treat (5, 1) as an apple.\n            *   If the Apple List says (8, 1) is an apple, and Visual says (8, 1) is `.`, I treat (8, 1) as an apple.\n\n    *   **The Move:**\n        *   **LEFT (5, 1):** According to Apple List, this is an apple. This gets me a point. Score 10. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT (7, 1):** Empty space. No point.\n        *   **UP (6, 2):** Empty space. No point.\n        *   **DOWN (6, 0):** Death (backwards).\n        *   Since I am behind on score (13-9), grabbing the apple at (5, 1) is the priority.\n        *   Is there any danger?\n            *   Enemy at (3, 3).\n            *   My body is at (6, 0), (5, 0), etc.\n            *   Moving to (5, 1) is safe from self-collision.\n            *   Enemy is far.\n        *   Let's check the geometry.\n            *   (5, 1) is adjacent to (5, 0) and (6, 0) and (6, 1). (5, 0) is my body. (6, 1) is my current head. (6, 0) is my body.\n            *   Moving to (5, 1) puts me next to my own body, but not inside it.\n            *   Next turn options from (5, 1): Up (5, 2) - empty. Left (4, 1) - empty. Right (6, 1) - occupied by my tail (which will move).\n            *   Looks solid.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (5, 1) to close the score gap. From (5, 1), I'll pivot up toward the center-left apples or prepare to sweep back right. The enemy is slow, I need to eat fast.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Not much immediate fruit here.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 2):**\n        *   **Status:** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e The Apple List explicitly includes (7, 2).\n        *   **Vision:** From (7, 2), I have access to (8, 2) (Empty), (7, 3) (Empty), and (7, 1) (Empty).\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Eating here gives me a point (Score 10), bringing me closer to the enemy. It also positions me on the right side of the board, potentially boxing the enemy into the left if I sweep across.\n    *   **UP (6, 3):**\n        *   **Status:** Looking at the board visual: `3 . . T T 0 . A . . .`\n        *   Coords: (6, 3) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   **Vision:** (6, 4) is an Apple (List says so). (6, 3) puts me on the same Y-level as the enemy head (4, 3).\n        *   **Risk:** The enemy is at (4, 3). If I go UP to (6, 3) and he goes RIGHT to (5, 3), we are adjacent. If he goes RIGHT again next turn to (6, 3) while I stay, I die. Or worse, if he decides to rush me.\n        *   **Comparison:** (7, 2) feels safer because it's further from his current position (4, 3).\n\n3.  **THE PLAY:**\n    *   I need points. **(7, 2)** is a guaranteed apple.\n    *   Moving to (7, 2) keeps my options open. I can swing back left or push right next turn.\n    *   Moving to (6, 3) puts me in the enemy's immediate lane. He has 13 apples; he's strong. I shouldn't challenge him head-on *yet* unless I have the size advantage. I don't.\n    *   Moving to (7, 2) allows me to eat, grow, and maintain distance.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (7, 2) to inch closer in score. From there, I'll assess if the enemy is pushing up the middle or staying left. If he goes central, I might take the right flank and loop around. If he stays left, I can dominate the right side apples.\n\n**MOVE:** RIGHT",

Move **DOWN** to (4,\u202f1).  \n2. Next turn go **RIGHT** onto the apple at (5,\u202f1) and grow.  \n3.

Let's see the board state.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 2)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 2) \u2014 He moved DOWN! He's now on the same Y-level as me, but on the left side.\n*   **Score:** 10 vs 13. I'm still behind.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (FROM HEAD (7, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 3):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (board shows `.`).\n    *   **Vision:** Leads towards (7, 4) (Apple) and (7, 8) (Apple). Good vertical path.\n    *   **Safety:** The enemy is at (4, 2). He is far left. I am safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):**\n    *   **Status:** Board shows `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Vision:** (7, 0) is also an Apple on the list.\n    *   **Safety:** My body occupies (6, 1) and (6, 0). I am not moving into myself. The enemy is far away.\n    *   **Risk:** This path leads towards the bottom edge. If I go down too far, I might get trapped against the wall. However, eating now is crucial to keep pace.\n\n3.  **LEFT (6, 2):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (I just came from here).\n    *   **Vision:** Back to where I was. Not progress.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, but boring.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (board shows `.`).\n    *   **Vision:** (9, 2) is an Apple.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, pushes towards the right wall. I have to watch out for getting boxed in later.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI need points. I have two immediate apples on the board:\n*   (7, 1) is directly DOWN.\n*   (9, 2) is two steps RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 3), I miss the immediate apple at (7, 1). While (7, 3) is a safe central move, I'm playing catch-up. I need to eat *now* to pressure the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 2). He is moving slowly. If I go DOWN to (7, 1), I eat an apple and get to (7, 0) next turn (which is also an apple). That's a potential 2-point swing immediately.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state:\nRow 1: `T . . . . A T . A A`\n(7, 1) is an Apple. (7, 0) is an Apple. But (6, 1) and (6, 0) are my body. If I go DOWN to (7, 1) and eat, I grow.\nNext turn, from (7, 1), I can go DOWN to (7, 0) (Apple) or LEFT to (6, 1) (My body - DEATH).\nSo I *must* go DOWN again.\n\nWait, let's check the board visual again.\nRow 1: `T . . . . A T . A A`\nCoordinates: (0,1) is T. (5,1) is A. (6,1) is T. (8,1) is A. (9,1) is A.\n(7, 1) is `.` in the visual, but the Apple List says (7, 1) is an apple. The visual might be slightly delayed or incomplete. The **APPLE LIST** is the source of truth.\nApple List: (7, 1) is present.\n\nLet's look at **RIGHT to (8, 2)**.\n(8, 2) is empty.\n(9, 2) is an Apple.\nFrom (8, 2), I can go to (9, 2) to eat.\nFrom (8, 2), I can also go UP to (8, 3) or DOWN to (8, 1).\n(8, 1) is an Apple (List: (8,1) is not explicitly listed? Wait, List has (9,1), (0,4), etc.\nList: (8, 1) is NOT in the apple list provided.\nList: (9, 1) is there.\nSo from (8, 2):\n*   UP: (8, 3) (Empty)\n*   DOWN: (8, 1) (Empty - visual says `A` but list says no. I trust list).\n*   LEFT: (7, 2) (Just left)\n*   RIGHT: (9, 2) (Apple)\n\nThe path RIGHT is safer long-term because it moves away from the enemy who is on the left. The path DOWN leads to the bottom-left corner. My tail is currently at (0, 1). If I go down to the bottom, I risk trapping myself against the wall and my own tail.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nThe enemy is on the far left (4, 2). I am on the right (7, 2). I should continue to claim the right side.\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 2) positions me to eat the apple at (9, 2) next turn.\nThis also keeps me mobile. I can swing UP or DOWN from (8, 2) or (9, 2).\nGoing DOWN to (7, 1) feels like a trap. It puts me at the bottom edge with limited escape routes (my body is at (6, 1) and (6, 0)).\nDominating the right side is the play. I'm 10 vs 13. I need to play smart, not desperate.\n\n**MOVE:** RIGHT\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

I'm down by 3. I need apples, but I need to survive to get them.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (FROM HEAD (8, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 3):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** The enemy is at (4, 1). He is low and left. He is not threatening (8, 3). My body is far away. This is safe.\n    *   **Vision:** Opens up paths to (8, 4), (8, 5), and eventually (8, 8) where there is an apple. It also keeps me centered on the right side.\n    *   **Risk:** Minimal.\n\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Visually, (8, 1) is an apple (`A`), but the **Apple List** provided does not contain (8, 1). The list is the source of truth. I trust the list. Therefore, (8, 1) is empty.\n    *   **Vision:** Leads towards (9, 1) (Apple on list) and (7, 0) (Apple on list).\n    *   **Risk:** This moves me down towards the bottom edge. My tail is currently at (0, 1). If I go down too aggressively, I might trap myself against the bottom wall or my own tail if I don't grow fast enough. I want to stay mobile.\n\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):**\n    *   **Status:** My own body (just vacated last turn).\n    *   **Safety:** Moving into your own body (even the cell you just left) counts as hitting yourself. **DEATH.**\n    *   **Verdict:** ILLEGAL MOVE.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):**\n    *   **Status:** Apple (List: (9, 2) is present).\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 2) is empty of obstacles other than the apple.\n    *   **Vision:** If I eat here, I grow.\n    *   **Risk:** **TRAP ALERT.** (9, 2) is on the far right edge. If I move here, my only valid moves next turn will be UP (9, 3), DOWN (9, 1), or LEFT (8, 2). LEFT leads back into my own body (which will be at (8, 2) after this move). That leaves me with only two forward options: UP or DOWN. If the enemy cuts me off, I'm boxed against the wall. **Domination requires mobility.**\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI am losing. I need apples. However, grabbing the apple at (9, 2) right now is a \"short-term gain, long-term pain\" scenario. It puts me on the edge of the board, reducing my maneuverability. The enemy is on the left (4, 1). I need to control the center and the right side, but I need space to maneuver.\n\n**UP (8, 3)** is the winning move.\n*   **Safety:** It is 100% safe from the enemy and my own body.\n*   **Positioning:** It moves me away from the bottom edge (where my tail is) and away from the right wall trap. It gives me access to (8, 4), (9, 3), (7, 3), and (8, 2) next turn.\n*   **Apple Access:** From (8, 3), I can reach (9, 2) or (9, 1) or (8, 8) in subsequent moves. It keeps my options open.\n*   **Enemy Pressure:** The enemy is at (4, 1). He is moving slowly. He isn't threatening my space yet. I need to claim the high ground (literally) to dominate the map later.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the vertical axis on the right side. From (8, 3), I can sweep up to (8, 8) to grab that apple, or swing right to (9, 2) if it's safe. I must avoid getting pinned against the wall.\n\n**MOVE:** UP",

The Snake Lists are the source of truth for logic.\nThe `T` at (8, 4) in the visual is likely a \"ghost\" or an error in the visualization logic, or it represents a body part that *will* be there or *was* there.\n**BUT**, the rules state: \"My head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\"\nIf the *List* does not contain (8, 4), then (8, 4) is safe.\n\nLet's look at the Board Visual again:\nRow 4: `A . T . . . A A . .`\nRow 4 covers Y=4.\nAt (8, 4), the Visual shows `.`\n**Wait, I misread the visual earlier.**\nLet's look at Row 4: `A . T . . . A A . .` (Indices 0-9)\nIndex 0: A\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: T\nIndex 3: .\nIndex 4: .\nIndex 5: .\nIndex 6: A\nIndex 7: A\nIndex 8: .\nIndex 9: .\n\nSo at (8, 4) (X=8, Y=4), the Visual shows `.` (Empty).\n\n**Why did I think (8, 4) was a T?**\nI must have hallucinated based on the density of Ts nearby.\nLet's re-evaluate moves from (8, 3):\n\n*   **UP (8, 4):**\n    *   **Visual:** `.`\n    *   **List:** Snake #0 does not list (8, 4).\n    *   **My Body:** Does not contain (8, 4).\n    *   **Apple:** (8, 4) is not in the Apple List.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 3):**\n    *   **Visual:** `.` (Row 3: `. . T T T . A . 1 .` -> Wait, Row 3 index 9 is `.`).\n    *   **List:** Safe.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n\n*   **DOWN (8, 2):**\n    *   **Visual:** `T` (Row 2: `T T T T T . T T T A` -> Index 8 is `T`).\n    *   **My Body:** My head was at (8, 3) last turn. My body is currently [(8, 3), ...]. So (8, 2) is my body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.**\n\n*   **LEFT (7, 3):**\n    *   **Visual:** `T` (Row 3 index 7 is `T`).\n    *   **List:** Snake #0 does not list (7, 3).\n    *   **Wait.** The Visual shows `T` at (7, 3). The List does not have it.\n    *   **Conflict.**\n    *   Let's check the Visual again.\n       Row 3: ` . . T T T . A . 1 .`\n       Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n       (7, 3) is Index 7. Visual says `.` (Empty).\n    *   Ah! I misread the board again.\n       Row 3: `. . T T T . A . 1 .`\n       Index 0: `.`\n       Index 1: `.`\n       Index 2: `T`\n       Index 3: `T`\n       Index 4: `T`\n       Index 5: `.`\n       Index 6: `A`\n       Index 7: `.`\n       Index 8: `1` (My head)\n       Index 9: `.`\n\n    *   **LEFT (7, 3):** Visual says `.`.\n    *   **List:** Snake #0 body list is: `[(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)]`.\n    *   (7, 3) is NOT in the list.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n\nMy body is at: `[(8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), ...]`\nI am at (8, 3).\n\n**Option 1: UP to (8, 4)**\n*   Safe (Visual `.`, List clear).\n*   **Pros:** Moves away from my tail (which is currently at (1, 0), moving to (0, 0)). Opens up vertical movement. Gets me higher up.\n*   **Cons:** The enemy is at (5, 1). They are far left/bottom.\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (7, 3)**\n*   Safe (Visual `.`, List clear).\n*   **Pros:** Moves towards the center. Avoids the right wall.\n*   **Cons:** Brings me closer to the enemy's position (5, 1).\n\n**Option 3: RIGHT to (9, 3)**\n*   Safe (Visual `.`, List clear).\n*   **Pros:** Gravitates towards apples at (9, 2) and (9, 6).\n*   **Cons:** **WALL TRAP.** If I go to (9, 3), I am pinned against the right wall. Next turn, I will only have UP, DOWN, or LEFT. LEFT will be my body (8, 3). So I will have 2 directions. This is bad for long-term survival.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to avoid the wall. (9, 3) is a trap.\nBetween UP (8, 4) and LEFT (7, 3):\n\n*   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (5, 1). They are growing slowly (14 apples). They are likely hunting apples on the left/bottom side.\n*   **My Position:** I am on the right side.\n*   **Apple Hunt:** There is an apple at (8, 8). To get there, I need to go UP.\n*   **Apple Hunt:** There is an apple at (7, 4).\n*   **Apple Hunt:** There is an apple at (7, 8).\n\nGoing **UP to (8, 4)** aligns me with the apple at (8, 8) and keeps me out of the bottom-left scrum where the enemy is.\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 3), I risk running into the enemy if they decide to push right. I'd rather keep the right side for myself.\n\n**PLUS:** My tail is at (1, 0). It's about to move to (0, 0) and disappear (I think, based on the logic that snakes grow when eating, and I have 10 apples).\nWait, let's check my length.\nMy body has 10 segments + Head.\nSo I am length 11.\nIf I don't eat, my tail moves. If I eat, my tail stays.\nI haven't eaten this turn.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n**UP (8, 4)** is the best move. It moves me up the right flank, avoids the wall trap, and avoids the enemy's immediate zone. It also opens up the path to (8, 5), (8, 6) etc.\n\n**FINAL MOVE: UP**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

I'm trailing by 4, but the game isn't over yet.\n*   **Visual Check:** The board shows an apple at (8, 4)! Wait, looking closely at the visual for row 4: `A . T . . . A A . .` (Indices 0-9).\n    *   Index 0: A\n    *   Index 2: T\n    *   Index 6: A\n    *   Index 7: A\n    *   Index 8: `.`\n    *   Index 9: `.`\n    *   Actually, looking at the provided list of apples, (8, 4) is NOT in the list.

I'll be pinned against the right edge.\n    *   **Verdict:** Avoid if possible.\n\n2.  **LEFT (7, 4):**\n    *   **Status:** **APPLE!** (7, 4) is in the apple list.\n    *   **Safety:** Visual shows `.` at (7, 4) (Index 7 of Row 4).\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Snake #0's body is at [(5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. (7, 4) is not there.\n    *   **My Body:** My tail is far away at (1, 0)/(0, 0).\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE and REWARDING.** This gives me an apple and brings my score to 11, closing the gap slightly. It also moves me toward the center of the board, giving me more mobility.\n\n3.  **UP (8, 5):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (Visual `.`, List clear).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Vision:** Opens up towards the top apples.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but doesn't get me points immediately.\n\n4.  **DOWN (8, 3):**\n    *   **Status:** My own body (I just came from here last turn).\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** Cannot move backwards into myself.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Immediate Gain:** Eating the apple at (7, 4) is the best play to close the score gap.\n*   **Positioning:** Moving to (7, 4) puts me closer to the center action and away from the dangerous right wall.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (5, 2). They are below me and to the left. They might be moving towards the apples at (7, 4) or (6, 3)/(6, 4). By taking (7, 4), I assert dominance and take the resource they might be eyeing.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 4) to score. From there, I'll have options to go UP towards the apples at (7, 8) or (8, 8), or LEFT to chase more apples. I need to keep my head on a swivel for the enemy's head (5, 2) and avoid getting trapped.\n\n**MOVE SELECTION:**\n**LEFT** to (7, 4). It's safe, it's food, and it's smart positioning.\n\nLEFT",

Turn 29, let's break down the grid and secure this W.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 4)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 3)\n*   **Score:** 11 vs 14. Gap is narrowing, but I still need to be aggressive.\n*   **Visual Check:** Looking at the board state:\n    *   Row 4: `A . T . . . A 1 T .` (X=0 to 9)\n    *   My head is at (7, 4) looking at the visual... wait, let me re-read the prompt. The prompt says \"HEAD: (7, 4)\" for my snake. But the visual shows `1` at index 7? Or is it `T`? Let me read carefully.\n    *   Visual Row 4: `A . T . . . A 1 T .`\n    *   Indices: 0:A, 1:., 2:T, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:A, 7:1, 8:T, 9:.\n    *   Wait, if my head is at (7, 4), that corresponds to X=7, Y=4. The visual shows `1` at X=7. The visual shows `T` at X=8.\n    *   Actually, the prompt says: \"My Head: (7, 4)\". The visual shows `1` at index 7. The visual shows `T` at index 8.\n    *   Let's check the body. My body is: `[(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), ...]`\n    *   So at (8, 4) there is a body part (T). At (7, 4) there is the head (1).\n    *   The visual `T` at index 8, Y=4 is correct for my body. The visual `1` at index 7, Y=4 is correct for my head.\n    *   However, I see an apple at `A` at index 6 (X=6, Y=4). And an apple at `A` at index 0 (X=0, Y=4).\n    *   Wait, the visual for Row 4 is `A . T . . . A 1 T .`.\n    *   Let's look at the apple list: (6, 4) is there. (0, 4) is there.\n    *   My head is at (7, 4).\n    *   Enemy head is at (5, 3).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (FROM HEAD (7, 4)):**\n\n1.  **RIGHT (8, 4):**\n    *   **Status:** My own body. (Body list has (8, 4)).\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** I die instantly.\n\n2.  **UP (7, 5):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (Visual `.`, List clear).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Vision:** Moves towards (7, 8) apple and (9, 6) apple.\n    *   **Verdict:** Good option. Opens up the top half.\n\n3.  **DOWN (7, 3):**\n    *   **Status:** Empty (Visual `.`, List clear).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Vision:** Moves towards (7, 0) apple, but (0, 4) is closer?\n    *   **Verdict:** Good option.\n\n4.  **LEFT (6, 4):**\n    *   **Status:** **APPLE!** (6, 4) is in the apple list.\n    *   **Safety:** Visual shows `A` at index 6. No body parts there.\n    *   **Verdict:** **OPTIMAL.** I eat the apple, score 12, and close the gap to 12 vs 14. I am moving LEFT into open space (X=5 is empty, X=4 is empty, etc).\n    *   **Enemy Check:** Enemy is at (5, 3). He is likely moving UP or RIGHT to chase apples. If he moves RIGHT to (6, 3), we don't collide. If he moves UP to (5, 4), we don't collide. If he moves UP to (5, 4), I am at (6, 4). Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Eating (6, 4) keeps me mobile. I can then go LEFT towards (0, 4) or UP/DOWN depending on enemy movement.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n*   **Immediate Gain:** Eating the apple at (6, 4) is priority #1. It keeps me in the game.\n*   **Positioning:** Moving to (6, 4) keeps me central.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy at (5, 3) is below me. He sees apples at (6, 4) too, but I am closer and it's a direct LEFT move. He might go for (6, 3) or (5, 4). I need to watch him next turn.\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat (6, 4). From there, I'll decide based on enemy movement. If he goes UP, I might go UP. If he stays low, I might go LEFT.\n\n**MOVE SELECTION:**\n**LEFT** to (6, 4). It's food, it's safe, and it's necessary to keep up.\n\nLEFT",

No, the visual shows `1` at index 2? Let me re-read the visual and the coordinates.\n        *   **Wait, I need to be careful.** The prompt says: \"My Head: (6, 4)\".\n        *   The visual for Row 4 is: `A . T . . .

Or is the visual showing where I *moved*? No, the visual is the *current* state.\n        *   **Let's look at the prompt again.**\n        *   \"My Head: (6, 4)\"\n        *   \"Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), ...]\"\n        *   **Visual Row 4:** `A .

The text description of head positions might be slightly off due to the \"START LAST MOVE\" logic provided in the prompt itself.\n        *   Let's look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" in the prompt. It says I picked LEFT from Turn 29.\n        *   The prompt says: \"My Head: (6, 4)\".\n        *   The visual shows `1` at (7, 4).\n        *   **This means I am actually at (7, 4).**\n        *   Why does the text say (6, 4)? Maybe it's the *destination* of the move I just made?\n        *   No, the prompt says \"Turn: 30\". The state shown is for Turn 30.\n        *   If the visual is for Turn 30, and I moved LEFT at Turn 29...\n        *   If I was at (8, 4) at Turn 28.\n        *   If I moved LEFT at Turn 29 -> (7, 4).\n        *   If I am at (7, 4) at Turn 30.\n        *   **Visual at (7, 4) is `1`.**\n        *   **Visual at (8, 4) is `T`.**\n        *   This matches my body: `[(8, 4), (8, 3), ...]`\n        *   **CONFIRMED:** My Head is at **(7, 4)**.\n        *   The text \"Head: (6, 4)\" in the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section is likely a typo or refers to something else, but the Visual and Body list confirm I am at (7, 4).\n        *   **Enemy Head:** Prompt says (5, 4).

The visual shows `.` at (4, 4).\n            *   Is the enemy at (6, 4)?

The state is for Turn 30.\n            *   If the enemy head is (5, 4) in the text, and the board shows `.` at (5, 4), there is a conflict.\n            *   **Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt.**\n            *   It says: \"My Head: (7, 4)\".\n            *   It says: \"Enemy Head: (5, 3)\".\n            *   **Aha! The \"START LAST RATIONALE\" (which describes the *previous* turn, Turn 29) says Enemy Head was at (5, 3).**\n            *   The \"OPPONENTS\" section (which describes the *current* turn, Turn 30) says Enemy Head is at (5, 4).\n            *   So the enemy moved from (5, 3) to (5, 4).\n            *   **Visual Check at (5, 4):** The visual shows `.`.\n            *   **Visual Check at (5, 3):** The visual shows `T` (which is part of the enemy body list).\n            *   **Conclusion:** The visual is NOT updated for the enemy head, or the text is wrong.\n            *   However, the text says \"Snake #0 - Head: (5, 4)\".\n            *   I will trust the text description of the enemy head location `(5, 4)` over the visual, as the visual might be slightly stale or I might be misinterpreting the visual representation of the head (often heads are denoted differently, but here it's just coordinates).\n            *   **Let's assume Enemy Head is at (5, 4).**\n            *   My Head is at (7, 4).\n            *   My Body: `[(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)]`\n            *   Enemy Body (from list): `[(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6)]`\n\n2.  **Analyze Moves from (7, 4):**\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 4):**\n        *   Status: My body.\n        *   Outcome: **DEAD**.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 4):**\n        *   Status: Visual shows `A` at (6, 4).\n        *   Outcome: **SAFE (Apple)**.\n    *   **UP (7, 5):**\n        *   Status: Visual shows `.` at (7, 5).\n        *   Enemy potential: Is Enemy Head at (5, 4)? Yes. Is he moving UP? Maybe.\n        *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 3):**\n        *   Status: Visual shows `.` at (7, 3).\n        *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Goal:** Win.\n    *   **Score:** 12 vs 14.\n    *   **Apple at (6, 4):** Eating this brings me to 13. Gap is 1.\n    *   **Enemy at (5, 4):** He is next to me.\n    *   **Risk Analysis:**\n        *   If I go **LEFT** to (6, 4), I eat an apple. The enemy is at (5, 4). If he goes **RIGHT**, we collide. If he goes **UP** or **DOWN**, I survive.\n        *   If I go **UP** or **DOWN**, I don't eat.\n        *   **Crucial:** The enemy has 14 apples. I have 12. If I eat, I have 13. I am still smaller (or equal length if he hasn't eaten recently? No, length = apples + starting length). Wait, usually snake length = apples + 1 (or + fixed start). If he has more apples, he is longer.\n        *   However, the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I do NOT have a higher score. So I must avoid head-on collision.\n        *   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (5, 4). He sees the apple at (6, 4). He likely wants it.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I challenge him for the apple.\n        *   If I go UP, I avoid him.\n        *   **BUT:** If I don't eat, I fall further behind. I need to close the gap.\n        *   **Is there a way to eat safely?**\n        *   If the enemy goes UP (5, 5) or DOWN (5, 3), I can eat (6, 4) safely.\n        *   If the enemy goes RIGHT (6, 4), we collide. Since he has more apples (14 > 12), I lose the tie-breaker/direct collision rules (usually smaller snake dies, or equal size both die). If he is longer, I die.\n        *   **Can I force him to not go RIGHT?**\n        *   I can't force him.\n        *   **Is there a better move?**\n        *   **UP (7, 5):** Opens up the top. (7, 8) is an apple. (9, 6) is an apple.\n        *   **DOWN (7, 3):** (7, 0) is an apple.\n        *   **LEFT (6, 4):** (0, 4) is an apple. (6, 4) is *right now*.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the Visual vs Text:**\n        *   If the Visual at (5, 4) is `.` (empty), and the Text says Enemy Head is (5, 4).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (6, 4), and the Enemy moves to (6, 4), we collide.\n        *   If the Enemy is actually at (5, 3) (as per the \"Last Rationale\"), and moves to (5, 4), then (6, 4) is free.\n        *   Wait, the \"OPPONENTS\" section says \"Head: (5, 4)\". This is the CURRENT turn (Turn 30).\n        *   So the enemy is definitely at (5, 4).\n        *   Why does the visual show `.` at (5, 4)? Maybe the visual represents the *static* board (apples/walls) and the *snakes* are overlaid?\n        *   Let's look at the visual again.\n        *   Row 4: `A . T . . .

No, `1` is me.\n        *   Maybe `T` represents the enemy? The `T` at (2,4) is likely enemy body.\n        *   Is it possible the \"OPPONENTS\" text is outdated?\n        *   **No, the prompt says \"Turn: 30 / 150\". The text provided is for this turn.**\n        *   **Hypothesis:** The visual is a simplified representation. The `T` at (2, 4) is definitely enemy body (not mine). The enemy body list ends at (3, 6). The head is (5, 4).\n        *   **Why is (5, 4) empty in the visual?**\n        *   Maybe the enemy head is NOT displayed as a special character in the visual provided, or it's an error in the visual generation for this specific prompt.\n        *   **However, I must rely on the text data for coordinates.**\n        *   Text: Enemy Head at (5, 4).\n        *   Text: My Head at (7, 4).\n        *   Distance: 2 cells away.\n\n    *   **Decision Time:**\n        *   **Option A: LEFT (6, 4).**\n            *   Target: Apple.\n            *   Enemy at (5, 4).\n            *   If Enemy goes RIGHT -> Collision. I lose (12 < 14).\n            *   If Enemy goes UP/DOWN/LEFT -> I eat. I grow. Gap closes.\n        *   **Option B: UP (7, 5).**\n            *   Target: Open space.\n            *   Enemy at (5, 4). He is unlikely to go UP if he wants the apple at (6, 4) or (0, 4).\n            *   If Enemy goes RIGHT -> He takes (6, 4). I am safe at (7, 5).\n            *   If Enemy goes UP -> He goes to (5, 5). I go to (7, 5). Safe.\n        *   **Option C: DOWN (7, 3).**\n            *   Similar to UP.\n\n    *   **Risk/Reward Analysis:**\n        *   The apple at (6, 4) is valuable. It's the only apple in my immediate vicinity.\n        *   If I don't take it, the enemy likely will.\n        *   However, risking a head-on collision against a stronger opponent (14 apples vs 12) is bad.\n        *   **Is there a way to trap the enemy?**\n        *   The enemy is at (5, 4).

The visual says `.`.\n        *   Who is at (5, 3)? The visual says `T`.\n        *   Who is at (5, 5)? The visual says `.`.\n        *   **If the enemy head is (5, 4) as per text, but visual says empty\u2026**\n        *   **Could the enemy head be hidden?**\n        *   No, that's silly.\n        *   **Is it possible the visual shows the state *before* the enemy move?**\n        *   No, the turn is 30. The state is for turn 30.\n        *   **Maybe the enemy head is represented by `1`?** No, I am `1`.\n        *   **Maybe the enemy head is at (5, 3) and the text is wrong?**\n        *   If the enemy head is at (5, 3), he cannot go RIGHT (to 6, 3) because of his body? No, his body is at (5, 2).\n        *   If he is at (5, 3), he can go RIGHT (6, 3).\n        *   If he goes RIGHT (6, 3), and I go LEFT (6, 4), we are not colliding.\n        *   But the text says he is at (5, 4).\n        *   **I will trust the text coordinates provided in the \"OPPONENTS\" section.**\n        *   Head: (5, 4).\n        *   This implies he moved UP from (5, 3).\n        *   If he moved UP, he is at (5, 4).\n        *   If he is at (5, 4), he can go RIGHT (6, 4).\n        *   **Decision stands: UP.**\n\n    *   **One more thing.**\n        *   \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n        *   I don't have a higher score.\n        *   So I avoid head-on collision.\n        *   Left is a potential head-on collision (if he goes right).\n        *   Up avoids it.\n\n    *   **Okay, writing the response.**YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's break down this turn!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Current Status:** My head is at (7, 4). Enemy head is at (5, 4). Score is 12 vs 14. I'm trailing, but charging hard.\n2.  **Threat Analysis:** The enemy is at (5, 4), staring right at the apple at (6, 4). He has more points, so if we collide, I lose. I can't risk a head-on charge against a stronger opponent unless I have the size advantage (which I don't).\n3.  **Option LEFT (6, 4):** This is the apple. It's tempting, but it's a trap! If the enemy moves RIGHT, we crash. Since he's winning and sees the food, he's likely to push for it. I can't gamble my life here.\n4.  **Option RIGHT (8, 4):** That's my own body. Instant death. Nope.\n5.  **Option DOWN (7, 3):** Safe, but it leads me straight into a tight corner near my own tail and the bottom edge. That's getting boxed in\u2014exactly what we *don't* want.\n6.  **Option UP (7, 5):** This is the play! It's completely safe (no snakes, no walls). It opens up the entire top half of the board for me. I can pivot toward the apples at (7, 8) and (9, 6) without risking an immediate death sentence.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm playing the long game. I need to close the score gap, but I can't do that if I'm dead. I'll move UP to secure space, keep my distance from the enemy, and set up a flanking maneuver. Let him have the (6, 4) apple for now; I'm coming for the bigger fish!\n\nUP",

It can\u2019t dive into us because our current head blocks the left side.\n- The squares **(5,6)** and **(4,5)** are both empty, but **(4,5)** gives us three safe exits next turn (up, left\u2011into\u2011the\u2011old\u2011tail, down) while keeping us away from the rival\u2019s \u201cright\u2011hand\u201d corridor.\n- No apple is screaming at us right now, so the priority is **survival + space control**. By sliding left we widen the corridor on the left side of the board, set up future moves into the vacated tail cell (3,5) and stay clear of the opponent\u2019s immediate path.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. **LEFT** now \u2013 grab that open slot and keep three exit options.\n2.

Let's analyze the board and secure the W.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Status:**\n    *   **My Head:** (6, 5) - Visual check confirms `1` at (6, 5) on Row 5.\n    *   **My Body:** `[(6, 4), (7, 4), ...]` - Visual check confirms `T` at (6, 4) on Row 4.\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (5, 5) - Visual check confirms `0` at (5, 5) on Row 5.\n    *   **Score:** 13 vs 14. I'm trailing by 1. I need an apple to tie, two to win.\n    *   **Board State (Row 5):** `. . T T . 0 1 . . .`\n        *   Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:T, 3:T, 4:., 5:0, 6:1, 7:., 8:., 9:.\n\n2.  **Threat Analysis:**\n    *   The enemy (Snake #0) is at (5, 5).\n    *   If he moves **LEFT**, he goes to (4, 5). Safe.\n    *   If he moves **RIGHT**, he goes to (6, 5). **CRASH.**\n    *   If he moves **UP**, he goes to (5, 6).\n    *   If he moves **DOWN**, he goes to (5, 4).\n\n3.  **Evaluating My Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 5):** This is the enemy's current head. If we both move simultaneously, he leaves (5, 5) and I enter (5, 5). This is safe *unless* he moves RIGHT into my current position (6, 5). If he moves RIGHT, we crash. Since he is winning (14 vs 13), he might get aggressive and try to crash me? Or he might play safe. But moving LEFT puts me directly in his path.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **UP (6, 6):** Empty. Safe. There is an apple at (6, 6)? No, looking at the list: (6, 3), (9, 6)... No apple at (6, 6). Wait, let me check the apple list again.\n        *   Apple list: (8,1), (9,2), (6,3), (9,6), (2,7), (7,8), (0,4), (9,1), (0,9), (7,9), (7,0), (1,6), (1,9), (9,9), (3,4).\n        *   No apple at (6, 6). No apple at (7, 5).\n    *   **DOWN (6, 4):** **MY OWN BODY.** Visual check: Row 4, Index 6 is `T`. This is instant death. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Play:**\n    *   **Score:** 13 vs 14. I am losing. I need to play carefully but aggressively to close the gap.\n    *   **Option LEFT (5, 5):** This is risky. It's a direct confrontation. If the enemy moves RIGHT, we collide. Since he has more points, he wins the tie. I cannot risk a tie-breaker loss when I'm already behind.\n    *   **Option RIGHT (7, 5):** This is safe and moves me horizontally. However, it doesn't put me in a direct path to an apple immediately.\n    *   **Option UP (6, 6):** This is safe and opens up the board.\n    *   **Option DOWN (6, 4):** Death. No.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look closer at the apple list.**\n    *   (7, 8) is an apple. I am at (6, 5). To get there, I need to go UP and RIGHT.\n    *   (9, 6) is an apple. I am at (6, 5). To get there, I need to go UP and RIGHT.\n    *   (6, 3) is an apple. I am at (6, 5). To get there, I need to go DOWN. But (6, 4) is my body. I cannot go down.\n\n    *   **Let's look at the Enemy.**\n    *   Enemy Head (5, 5). Enemy Body: (5, 4), (5, 3)...\n    *   If I move **UP** to (6, 6), I am safe.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 5), I am safe.\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (5, 5), I am entering the zone of danger.\n\n    *   **Constraint Check:** \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n    *   If I move LEFT (5, 5) and he moves RIGHT (6, 5), we crash. He wins (14 > 13).\n    *   If I move UP (6, 6) and he moves RIGHT (6, 5), we don't crash.\n    *   If I move UP (6, 6) and he moves UP (5, 6), we don't crash.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n    *   Moving **LEFT** is a gamble on the enemy's move. If he stays put or moves away, I'm safe. If he moves towards me, I lose. Since I am trailing, I cannot afford to lose on a gamble unless it's a guaranteed win. This is not a guaranteed win.\n    *   Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** guarantees my survival for this turn.\n    *   Looking at the board, I am currently \"boxed in\" by my own body below me and the enemy to my left.\n    *   My body stretches from (6, 4) down to (1, 0).\n    *   The enemy is at (5, 5).\n    *   To dominate the board, I need space. Moving **UP** gives me access to the top half of the board (rows 6-9).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** keeps me in the middle rows, potentially circling back into my own tail soon.\n\n    *   **Final Choice: UP.**\n    *   Why? It avoids the immediate confrontation with the enemy (who is likely to chase the apple at (6, 3) or stay safe). It opens up the region Y=6, which has apples at (6, 3) [wait, that's down], (9, 6), (7, 8).\n    *   Actually, (6, 3) is DOWN from me. I can't go down.\n    *   (9, 6) is UP and RIGHT.\n    *   (7, 8) is UP and RIGHT.\n    *   (1, 6) is UP and LEFT.\n    *   Moving UP positions me to access these apples without immediately crashing into my own tail or the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm moving UP to break out of the lower quadrant. The enemy is at (5, 5). If he moves RIGHT, he risks crashing into me if I moved LEFT, but I'm not moving LEFT. I'm moving UP. This gives me positional advantage and safety. I need to find apples in the upper half of the board (6-9 rows) to close the 1-point gap. Let's keep the pressure on!\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is still leading by 1 apple (14 to 13), but I've got the board awareness to turn this around. Let's break down the board state.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Board Analysis:**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at (6, 6). Body stretches down to (3, 0). I'm currently in the left-center column, vertically stacked.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 5). Body fills the column x=5 from y=5 down to y=1, and loops to x=4 at y=1-5.\n    *   **Apples:** There is a massive cluster forming on the right side. Specifically, **(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1)**. The enemy is positioned at (4, 5), which is much closer to the left-side apples, but I see a clear path to the right side dominance.\n\n2.  **Survival Check (Eliminating Instant Deaths):**\n    *   **DOWN (6, 5):** My body is at (6, 5). **DEAD.** (Actually, my body is at (6, 5) from the previous turn? Let me check my list: Head was (6, 6), body is [(6,5)...]. Yes, moving down means I eat my own neck. **ELIMINATED.**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 6):** Let's check the board. Row 6 shows: `. A . . . . 1 . . A`. Index 5 is empty. However, the enemy is at (4, 5). If I go LEFT to (5, 6), I'm safe from immediate collision. But...\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **UP (6, 7):** Row 7 shows: `. . A . . . . . . .`. Index 6 is empty. Safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Positioning (The Aggressive Play):**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 6):** This moves me closer to the enemy. While safe now, it reduces my maneuvering space. The left side of the board is cluttered with my own body below.\n    *   **UP (6, 7):** This keeps me in the same column. Looking at Row 7, there is an apple at (2, 7). To get there, I'd have to weave through my own tail. Not ideal. Also, (6, 7) keeps me in a column that is becoming a \"column of death\" because my body is stacking up there.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6):** This is the key. Moving RIGHT opens up the entire right side of the board (columns 7-9). Looking at the apple list, the right side is LOADED: (9,2), (9,6), (9,9), (7,8), (7,9).\n    *   **Comparison:** If I go RIGHT to (7, 6), I am positioned perfectly to snake my way up to (7, 8) (apple) or (9, 6) (apple). The enemy is on the left side. He has to deal with my body if he tries to cross over.\n\n4.  **The \"Box In\" Plan:**\n    *   The stream title says \"box him in\". How do I do that?\n    *   My body currently blocks the bottom left. By moving RIGHT to (7, 6), I am effectively building a wall on the left side of the board while positioning myself to claim the high-value territory on the right.\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 5). He has limited space below him (y=0-4 is mostly his body or obstacles). He has to move up eventually. If he moves up, I will be moving right/up.\n    *   **Critical Observation:** There is an apple at (7, 8). From (7, 6), I can reach (7, 8) in two turns by going UP UP, provided the path is clear. The enemy is at (4, 5); he cannot reach (7, 8) in two turns.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am committing to the right flank. By moving RIGHT now, I secure the center-right corridor. My next moves will be UP to secure the apple at (7, 8) or (9, 6). I am ignoring the cluttered left side. The enemy is effectively boxed in on the left by my long tail and the board edge. Let's secure the W by claiming the apples that are furthest away from him.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the right flank. Chain moves UP/RIGHT to hit (7, 8) or (9, 6). Use my length to cut off the enemy's access to the center. If he comes up to challenge me, we go for a head-on collision where my length gives me the advantage or I force him into a wall.\n\nRIGHT",

We need to make a move that sets us up for the win. Let's look at the board state.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **My Position:** Head is at (7, 6).\n    *   Body: `[(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`\n    *   Length: 14 segments (Head + 13 body).\n    *   Score: 13 apples.\n\n2.  **Opponent Position:** Snake #0 Head at (3, 5).\n    *   Body fills `(4, 5)` to `(5, 5)` and below.\n    *   Score: 14 apples.\n\n3.  **Board State & Immediate Threats (Eliminating Instant Deaths):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 7):** Let's check the board.\n        *   Row 7: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n        *   Coordinate (7, 7) is **EMPTY**.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 5):**\n        *   Row 5: `. . . 0 T T T . . .`\n        *   Coordinate (7, 5) is **EMPTY** (the `0` is at (3,5) and `T` is at (5,5)).\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 6):**\n        *   My body is at (6, 6). **DEAD.** (Cannot move back into my own neck).\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 6):**\n        *   Row 6: `. A . . . . T 1 . A` (My head is at 7, so 8 is the dot next to it).\n        *   Coordinate (8, 6) is **EMPTY**.\n\n    **Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n4.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Why not DOWN (7, 5)?**\n        *   Moving down keeps me relatively close to the enemy, who is currently at (3, 5).\n        *   My tail is at (4, 0), so I'm clearing space at the bottom right, but the top right has more valuable apples (9,6), (7,8), (9,9).\n    *   **Why not RIGHT (8, 6)?**\n        *   This is a strong contender. It moves me deeper into the right flank, claiming space.\n        *   However, looking at the board, there is an Apple at **(8, 1)**. If I go RIGHT now, I'm moving away from the apple cluster on the top right (7,8) and (9,9) slightly compared to going UP.\n        *   Actually, let's look at the board again.\n            *   (7, 8) is an Apple.\n            *   (9, 6) is an Apple.\n            *   (9, 9) is an Apple.\n    *   **Why UP (7, 7)?**\n        *   **Target Acquisition:** (7, 8) is an Apple. If I go UP to (7, 7), I am one step away from (7, 8).\n        *   **Positioning:** This moves me vertically towards the top-right cluster.\n        *   **Enemy Distance:** The enemy is at (3, 5). They are much closer to the left-side apples (like 2,7). They are not an immediate threat to the (7,8) apple.\n        *   **Safety:** (7, 7) is empty.\n        *   **Future Options:** From (7, 7), I can go UP to (7, 8) to eat the apple, or RIGHT to (8, 7) to scout.\n\n5.  **The Plan:**\n    *   **Current Turn (33):** Move UP to (7, 7).\n    *   **Next Turn (34):** Move UP to (7, 8) to eat the apple. This grows my score to 14, tying Snake #0.\n    *   **Aggression:** By securing the top right, I cut off the enemy's access to the (9,9) and (7,8) apples. My long body is effectively a wall on the left side, boxing him in against the wall. If he tries to cross over, he has to navigate around my tail, risking a collision.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7,8) next turn to tie the score. After that, push towards (9,9) or (9,6) depending on where the enemy moves. If the enemy moves up to challenge the center, look for a head-on collision. I have the length advantage (14 vs his ~14, but I feel bigger on the board).\n\nUP",

Snatching the apple at (3,4) pushes the margin to +2 and forces the rival to chase points.\n2. **Safety** \u2013 the cell is far from the opponent, so no collision risk.\n3. **Future flexibility** \u2013 after we grow, the only safe next step is **RIGHT** to (4,4), after which we\u2019ll have the full suite of moves again (up, down, left, right). That keeps us mobile enough to react to whatever the opponent does.\n4. **Space control** \u2013 staying in the central\u2011lower corridor prevents us from getting squeezed against the left wall while still leaving a clear path to swing upward later and cut off the opponent\u2019s route.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. **Take the apple** (DOWN).  \n2. Next turn head **RIGHT** into (4,4) to open up the full 4\u2011direction options again.  \n3. Then start probing upward (UP) to line up with the opponent\u2019s y\u2011level, looking for a chance to force a head\u2011on when they try to press leftward or downwards.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that fruit and keep the pressure on!  \n\nDOWN",

My body is a massive wall on the left side.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (7, 8):** This is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it ties the score 14-15. Looking at the board state, (7, 8) is marked as an apple (`A`). Is it empty of snakes? My body is nowhere near. The enemy is far left at (3, 4). The path is clear. This is the best immediate move for points and board control.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 6):** My body is currently at (7, 6) from my *last* move. Wait, let me check the body list again. My head was at (7, 7) in the prompt? No wait, the prompt says \"Head: (7, 7)\".\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt lists `HEAD: (7, 7)`. My previous move was UP. If my head was at (7, 6) and I moved UP, I'm now at (7, 7). The body list provided shows (7, 6) as the first body segment. So moving DOWN to (7, 6) would hit my own neck/body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT (6, 7):** My body list includes (6, 6) and (6, 5), but (6, 7) looks empty based on the board. Row 7 shows `. . A . . . . . 1 . .` (Wait, the board shows my head as `1` at (7,7). The cell to the left is (6, 7)). Row 7 in the board text: `. . A . . . . . . .`. Actually, looking closely at the board text provided:\n        ```\n        7 . . A . . . . 1 . .\n        ```\n        This represents columns 0-9. `1` is at col 7. Col 6 is the dot before it. So (6, 7) is empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Row 7, column 8 is a dot. Empty. **Safe.**\n\n2.  **Strategy & Risk:**\n    *   The enemy is far away (x=3). I have a massive wall of body from x=0 to x=7 on the lower half of the board. I am effectively trapping the enemy on the left.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (7, 8) gives me the apple, increasing my score to 14. It puts me in a prime position to chase the top-right apples (9,9) or (9,6).\n    *   Moving RIGHT or LEFT keeps me at 13 points. While safe, I need points to catch up. I cannot win by turtling.\n    *   **Risk of UP:** Is (7, 8) guaranteed safe? The enemy could theoretically move to cut me off or position to collide next turn, but he's too far to reach (7, 8) this turn. The only threat is if he predicts I'll go for (9,9) and moves to intercept, but that's future turns.\n    *   **Risk of LEFT:** (6, 7) is safe, but where does it put me? I'm moving closer to the left wall where my body is thick. It limits my escape routes.\n    *   **Risk of RIGHT:** (8, 7) is safe. It keeps me open but delays points.\n\n3.  **The Winning Move:**\n    *   I am trailing. I need to eat.\n    *   The apple at (7, 8) is *right there*.\n    *   If I take the apple, I tie the score and extend my length. A longer body means more board control and more potential for the enemy to crash into me later.\n    *   I am boxing the enemy in. By taking the top-right quadrant, I force him to stay in the lower-left or risk crossing my path.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 8) immediately. Tie the score. From (7, 8), I have eyes on (9, 9) and (9, 6). I will continue to dominate the right side. My body creates a fence on the left. If the enemy tries to cross the midline, he risks running into my long tail or my head. I will force him into a corner. If he challenges me head-on while I'm longer, I win.\n\nUP",

The enemy is at 15, still one point ahead. They're tucked away on the left side at (2, 4). My body is a massive wall forming a fence on the left and bottom. The board is packed with my tail segments and the enemy's tail. It's getting claustrophobic, but I'm setting up the trap.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Safe Moves (Current Head: (7, 8)):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 9):** Looking at the board state, row 9 col 7 is marked as `A` (Apple). Is it empty of snakes? My body is nowhere near (7, 9). The enemy is far left. This looks like a clean apple pickup.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 7):** My body is currently at (7, 7). It's the first segment after my head. If I go DOWN, I run straight into my own neck. **DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 8):** Row 8, col 6. The board shows `.` (Dot). It's empty. Safe move.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Row 8, col 8. The board shows `.` (Dot). It's empty. Safe move.\n\n2.  **Strategy & Risk:**\n    *   **The Score:** I'm trailing 14-15. I need apples to catch up and eventually win.\n    *   **The Apple:** There is an apple at (7, 9). Taking it puts me at 15 points, tying the score. It also extends my length by one segment. A longer body is better for controlling space.\n    *   **Board Control:** My current position at (7, 8) is high on the board. Moving UP to (7, 9) puts me at the top edge. From there, I can move RIGHT towards the cluster of apples at (9,9), (9,8), etc. I want to dominate the right side and the top.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** The enemy is at (2, 4). They are far away and currently blocked by my own body segments in the lower-left. They cannot threaten me immediately. Moving UP is safe from immediate collision.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **UP:** Gains a point (ties score), extends body, secures a top-right position. High reward.\n        *   **LEFT/RIGHT:** Stays at 14 points, keeps me in the middle of the board but misses the immediate point. Safe, but passive. I don't want to be passive when an apple is right in front of my face.\n\n3.  **The Winning Move:**\n    *   I need to eat. The apple at (7, 9) is the closest target and it's safe.\n    *   By moving UP, I force the enemy to make a move. If they try to come up to challenge me, they have to navigate through the maze of my tail. I have the high ground.\n    *   If I take the apple, I tie the score. Next turn, I'm at (7, 9) looking right. I can chase the apples at (9,9) or (9,6). The enemy has to decide whether to defend the left or try to cross to the right. My body acts as a barrier.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (7, 9) to tie the score. From (7, 9), sweep right to collect the apples at (9,9) and (9,8). Use my long body to cut off the enemy's escape routes on the left side. Force them into a corner where they have to crash into me or the wall. If I get a lead, I'll consider a head-on collision to seal the deal.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're at Turn 36, head at (7, 9). Let's break this down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Safe Moves (Current Head: (7, 9)):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 10):** Row 10. Board size is 0-9. This is OUT OF BOUNDS. **DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):** My body is currently at (7, 8) (that's my first body segment). If I go DOWN, I run straight into my own neck. **DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Row 9, col 6. The board shows `.` (Dot). Empty. Safe move.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Row 9, col 8. The board shows `1` (My own head). Wait, looking at the ASCII map:\n        `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        My head is at `x=7, y=9`. The char `1` is at the 8th column (0-indexed), which is x=7. The cell to my right (x=8) is a `.`.\n        Wait, let me look at the map again.\n        `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        So (7,9) is `1`.\n        (8,9) is `.`.\n        (6,9) is `.`.\n        So LEFT and RIGHT are both empty cells on the board.\n        However, I must check snake bodies.\n        My body: (7,8), (7,7), (7,6)... (5,0). (6,9) is NOT in my body list. (8,9) is NOT in my body list.\n        Enemy body: (2,4), (3,4)... (2,2). Neither (6,9) nor (8,9) is in the enemy body.\n\n2.  **Strategy & Risk:**\n    *   **Score:** Tied 15-15.\n    *   **Enemy:** Head at (1, 4). He is far away on the left.\n    *   **Apples:** I'm currently sitting on an apple (8,1)? No, wait. The apple list says (8,1) exists. My head is (7,9). I am NOT on an apple. Wait, looking at the board state:\n        `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        My head (7,9) is NOT an apple. The apples listed in text are just available apples.\n        Looking at the board map row 9: `A A . . . . . 1 . A`. This means:\n        (0,9) is A\n        (1,9) is A\n        (7,9) is 1 (Me)\n        (9,9) is A\n        There is NO apple at (7,9). The apple at (7,9) was eaten in the previous turn? No, my head was (7,8) last turn. I ate an apple at (7,8)?\n        Let's re-read the \"Last Move Rationale\" from the prompt.\n        \"There is an apple at (7, 9). Taking it puts me at 15 points...\"\n        \"Move UP to (7, 9): Looking at the board state, row 9 col 7 is marked as A (Apple).\"\n        Wait, looking at the CURRENT board state provided:\n        `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        (7,9) is the `1`.\n        The `A`s are at (0,9), (1,9), (9,9).\n        Is there an apple at (7,9)? NO.\n        Is there an apple at (6,9)? NO.\n        Is there an apple at (8,9)? NO.\n        However, looking at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list: (9,9), (1,9), (0,9), etc.\n        (9,9) is an apple. (1,9) is an apple. (0,9) is an apple.\n        (7,9) is NOT in the apple list.\n        *Correction:* My previous logic in the \"Last Rationale\" section of the prompt seems to be a hypothetical thought process or a mismatch with the current state. The current state clearly shows my head at (7,9) and NO apple there.\n        *Wait*, let me look at the board state again.\n        Row 9: `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n        Row 7: `7 . . A . . . . T . .`\n        Row 6: `6 . A . . . . T T . A`\n        Row 5: `5 A . . T T T T . . .`\n        Row 4: `4 A 0 T T . T T T T .`\n        Row 3: `3 . A .

T T A . .`\n\n        Let's map the apples from the \"APPLE DROPS\" list to the board.\n        (8,1): Row 1, Col 8. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (9,2): Row 2, Col 9. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (6,3): Row 3, Col 6. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (9,6): Row 6, Col 9. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (2,7): Row 7, Col 2. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (0,4): Row 4, Col 0. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (9,1): Row 1, Col 9. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n        (0,9): Row 9, Col 0. Board shows `A`.

Correct.\n        (0,5): Row 5, Col 0. Board shows `A`. Correct.\n\n        My head is at (7,9).\n        Row 9 is `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        (7,9) is the `1`.\n        (8,9) is `.`.\n        (6,9) is `.`.\n        (9,9) is `A`.\n\n        **I am NOT on an apple.** My previous move (UP) from (7,8) to (7,9) did NOT eat an apple.\n        Therefore, my score is still 15? No, \"Your snake apples: 15\" is the current score. I didn't eat this turn.\n        Wait, if I didn't eat, did I grow? No. My length is fixed until I eat.\n\n        *Hypothesis:* The \"Last Move Rationale\" provided in the prompt was describing a *planned* move, not the result of the move. But the prompt says \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):\" and then \"UP\".\n        If I moved UP to (7,9) and (7,9) is NOT an apple, then I didn't eat.\n        *BUT*, looking at the board state *now*, my head is at (7,9).\n        Did I move into an apple that disappeared?\n        Let's look at the apple list again. (9,9) is there. (1,9). (0,9).\n        Is (7,9) an apple? The ASCII map says NO.\n        Is it possible the map is slightly off or the apple list is the source of truth?\n        If (7,9) was an apple, it would be marked `A` or `1` if I ate it.\n        It is marked `1`.\n        Let's look at the board state from the *previous* turn (if I could).\n        I was at (7,8).\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n        (7,8) was `T` (My body).\n        (8,8) was `.`\n        (6,8) was `.`\n        (7,9) was `.` (Row 9 map shows `.` before the `1`).\n        So (7,9) was empty.\n        Therefore, moving UP to (7,9) was safe but did not gain an apple.\n\n        *Correction 2:*\n        Wait, looking at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt:\n        \"There is an apple at (7, 9). Taking it puts me at 15 points...\"\n        This is the AI's *thought process* from the previous turn.\n        But the CURRENT board state shows (7,9) is my head (1) and no apple.\n        This implies either:\n        1. The apple was there, I ate it, and the map updated to show my head.\n        2. The apple was NOT there, and the AI's previous rationale was flawed or hallucinated an apple.\n        \n        Let's look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list again.\n        (9,9), (1,9), (0,9), (9,8), (1,6), (7,0), (0,4), (2,7), (9,6), (6,3), (9,2), (8,1).\n        Is (7,9) in the list? NO.\n        Is (6,9) in the list? NO.\n        Is (8,9) in the list? NO.\n\n        So, there is NO apple at (7,9). The previous rationale was WRONG about the apple location.\n        I did NOT eat an apple.\n        My score remains 15. Enemy score 15.\n\n        **Current Situation:**\n        Head (7,9).\n        Left (6,9) is empty.\n        Right (8,9) is empty.\n        Down (7,8) is my body (Death).\n        Up (7,10) is wall (Death).\n        \n        **Choices:** LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n        **Analysis:**\n        I am at the top edge (y=9). I cannot go up.\n        I am trapped against the top wall if I stay at (7,9) too long, but I can move left or right along the top row.\n        \n        **Apple Locations:**\n        Top Row (y=9): (0,9) [Left], (1,9) [Left], (9,9) [Right].\n        Right Side (x=9): (9,8), (9,6), (9,2).\n        \n        **Enemy:**\n        (1,4). He is far left.\n        \n        **My Body:**\n        My body creates a wall on the left side of the board (x=6,7 mostly).\n        If I go LEFT to (6,9), I am moving towards (1,9) and (0,9) apples.\n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I am moving towards (9,9), (9,8), etc.\n\n        **Risk Assessment:**\n        If I go LEFT to (6,9):\n        Next turn I could go DOWN to (6,8). (6,8) is currently `.` (empty).\n        Or LEFT to (5,9). (5,9) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9):\n        Next turn I could go DOWN to (8,8). (8,8) is `.` (empty).\n        Or RIGHT to (9,9). (9,9) is an APPLE.\n        \n        **Comparing LEFT vs RIGHT:**\n        **LEFT (6,9):**\n        - Pro: Moves towards apples (1,9), (0,9).\n        - Con: Moves closer to the enemy's general area (Left side), though he is currently far.\n        - Con: My own body is dense on the left (x=5,6,7). Risk of boxing myself in.\n        \n        **RIGHT (8,9):**\n        - Pro: Opens up the Right side (x=9).\n        - Pro: (9,9) is an apple (reachable in 1 move from 8,9).\n        - Pro: The Right side is relatively clear. My body is mostly x<=7.\n        - Pro: Moves AWAY from the enemy (who is at x=1).\n        \n        **Strategic Choice:**\n        I should secure the right side. The enemy is on the left. If I take the right side, I control half the board.\n        From (8,9), I can eat (9,9) next turn.\n        From (8,9), I can go DOWN to (8,8) which is empty.\n        \n        Let's check safety of (8,9).\n        Is (8,9) occupied? No. Board shows `.`.\n        Is it an apple? No.\n        \n        Let's check safety of (6,9).\n        Is (6,9) occupied? No. Board shows `.`.\n        \n        **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n        The enemy is at (1,4).\n        Can the enemy reach (8,9) in one turn? No.\n        Can the enemy reach (6,9) in one turn? No.\n        \n        **Self-Collision Risk:**\n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), can I move DOWN to (8,8) next turn?\n        (8,8) is empty.\n        Can I move LEFT to (7,9)?\n        (7,9) will be my tail if I don't eat.\n        If I move (8,9) -> (8,8) -> (7,8) -> (7,7) ... I might run into myself.\n        But looking at the board, (8,8) is empty. (7,8) is currently my body (the neck).\n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), my tail at (5,0) moves forward.\n        Next turn, if I go DOWN to (8,8), my tail will move up.\n        (7,8) (current neck) will become (7,9) (tail tip? No, head moves, tail moves).\n        \n        **Let's look at the specific board geometry.**\n        Top row: `9 A A . . . . . 1 . A`\n        If I move RIGHT to (8,9):\n        I am at `.`.\n        Next turn I can go DOWN to (8,8).\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n        (8,8) is `.`. Safe.\n        \n        If I move LEFT to (6,9):\n        I am at `.`.\n        Next turn I can go DOWN to (6,8).\n        Row 8: `6 . A . . . . T T . A`\n        (6,8) is `T` (My body).\n        Wait, (6,8) is `T`?\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        (7,8) is `T`.\n        (6,8) is `.` (Index 6).\n        So (6,8) is empty.\n        \n        **Wait, looking at the ASCII map again.**\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n        (6,8) is index 6. It is `.`.\n        (7,8) is index 7. It is `T`.\n        \n        So both (6,9) and (8,9) allow a DOWN move to empty space next turn.\n        \n        **Why choose RIGHT?**\n        The apples at (9,9) and (9,8) are valuable and currently uncontested.\n        The enemy is on the left. If I go LEFT, I move closer to the enemy.\n        If I go RIGHT, I move away.\n        \n        **Is there any trap?**\n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I am at the top right corner area.\n        My tail is long (15 segments + length). My tail is currently ending at (5,0).\n        If I go RIGHT, my tail moves.\n        I need to ensure I don't get trapped against the right wall.\n        The right wall is at x=9.\n        I am currently at x=7. Moving to x=8 is safe.\n        \n        **Enemy Prediction:**\n        Enemy at (1,4).\n        Apples near enemy: (0,4), (2,7), (1,6), (1,3), (0,5).\n        The enemy will likely move towards these apples.\n        They are unlikely to rush right to fight me immediately, especially since they are tied on score.\n        \n        **Decision:**\n        Go RIGHT. Claim the right side. Set up for (9,9) apple next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (8,9) to secure the right flank. Next turn, move DOWN to (8,8) or RIGHT to (9,9) to grab the apple. Keep the enemy contained on the left side. Use my long body to block the center column (x=5,6,7) while I feast on the right side apples.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Tied! \ud83d\udca5\n*   **My Body:** [(8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (0, 5) \u2014 He's still chilling on the left side, likely moving toward that apple cluster.\n*   **Score:** 16-16. We are TIED. Time to press the advantage.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP:** (9, 10) \u2014 Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n2.  **RIGHT:** (10, 9) \u2014 Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n3.  **DOWN:** (9, 8) \u2014 According to the board map, this cell is **OCCUPIED** (marked as 'A' or 'T'? Wait, looking at the map: Row 8 has `(9, 8)` listed as an apple 'A', but wait... let's look closer.\n    *   **Board Row 8:** ` . . . . . . . T . A`\n    *   Column 8 is `T` (Tail/Body).\n    *   Column 9 is `A` (Apple).\n    *   Wait, looking at my **last move**: I moved RIGHT to (9, 9). That was the apple.\n    *   Let's check the board representation again.\n    *   **Row 9:** `9 A A . . A . . T T 1` -> (9,9) was the '1' (My head) in the *previous* turn's visual? No, the visual is the state *before* my move? The prompt says \"Turn: 38 / 150\". The \"Board State\" is the current state *before* I move.\n    *   **Correction:** The \"Board State\" shows `9 A A . . A . . T T 1`. The `1` at (9,9) represents **Me**.\n    *   Wait, if I am at (9,9), and I am looking for my next move...\n    *   Let's look at **Row 8:** `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n    *   (8,9) is 'A'. (8,8) is 'T'. (8,7) is '.'.\n    *   So, **DOWN** to (9,8)?\n    *   **Row 9:** `9 A A . . A . . T T 1`\n    *   Wait, the coordinates in the map are usually X (column) and Y (row).\n    *   The prompt says: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n    *   The Map shows Rows 9 to 0.\n    *   My Head is at (9,9). That is the top right corner.\n    *   My Body starts at (8,9). That is to my LEFT.\n    *   The Board Map at Row 9: `9 A A . . A . . T T 1`\n    *   Let's index this: Col 0='A', 1='A', 2='.', ... 7='T', 8='T', 9='1'.\n    *   So my body is at (7,9) and (8,9).\n    *   Now, checking **DOWN** from (9,9): Target is (9,8).\n    *   Map Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . T . A`\n    *   Indexing Row 8: Col 0='.', 1='.', 2='.', 3='.', 4='.', 5='.', 6='.', 7='T', 8='.', 9='A'.\n    *   So (9,8) is an **APPLE** ('A')! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   Is it safe? It is an apple, so it's not a snake body (unless an enemy is there, but enemies are on the left).\n    *   Is it empty? Yes, the map shows 'A'.\n    *   Is it out of bounds? No.\n    *   Is it my own body? No.\n    *   **LEFT:** (8,9). This is currently occupied by my own body (the neck). **DEATH.**\n\n**DECISION:**\n*   **UP/RIGHT:** Out of bounds.\n*   **LEFT:** Into my own body.\n*   **DOWN:** (9,8) is an **APPLE**. Safe. Delicious. And it opens up the path downward.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (9,8) to grow to 17 and take the lead! Then I can start sweeping down the right side. The enemy is still stuck on the left.\n\nLet's go!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (9,8), then sweep downwards. Watch out for the enemy on the left, but we have the space advantage.\n\nDOWN",

I'm on the right edge, high up.\n*   **UP to (9, 9):** I just came from there. My body is still there. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 8):** Out of bounds. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n*   **DOWN to (9, 7):** Checking the board map... Row 7 is `. . . A . . . . . .` at column 9. It's empty! (Wait, looking closer at the map provided: Row 7: `. . . A . . . . . .` - actually checking the visual provided again in the prompt).\n    *   The prompt map shows Row 8 (y=8) as `. . . . . . . T . A`.\n    *   The prompt map shows Row 7 (y=7) as `. . . A . . . . . .`.\n    *   So (9, 7) is empty.\n    *   Let's check my body. My body list ends at `(6, 0)`. My head is `(9,8)`. My body goes `(9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9)...`. None of my body is at `(9,7)`.\n    *   Is there an enemy there? Enemy #0 is at `(1, 5)`. Enemy #0 body is on the left side. No.\n    *   **Safe.**\n*   **LEFT to (8, 8):** Checking the map... Row 8 at column 8 is `.`. (Wait, Row 8 in the map is `8 . . . . . . . T . A`).\n    *   Col 8 is `.`. It's empty.\n    *   Is it my body? My body at `Y=8`: Head is `(9,8)`. Next is `(9,9)`. `(8,8)` is not in my body list. It is safe.\n    *   Is it enemy? No.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI have two safe moves: **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n*   **LEFT (8, 8):** Moves me away from the right wall but closer to the center. However, looking at the board, the center is getting cluttered with my own long body (I have 18 segments now). Moving Left puts me near `(7,8)` which is part of my body (if I check my list: `[(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...]`). Wait, (7,8) is in my body.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (8,8), next turn my options might be limited because (7,8) is occupied by my own tail (which will move, but usually means tight spaces).\n    *   Looking at the map: Row 8 has `T` at col 7. Row 9 has `T` at col 7 and 8.\n    *   The \"T\"s on the map represent *my* body (since I am ID 1 and the '1' is there).\n    *   So (7,8) is occupied. If I go LEFT to (8,8), I am sandwiched between my body at (9,8) (behind me, moving away) and (7,8) (to my left). This looks like a bottleneck.\n*   **DOWN (9, 7):** Moves me toward the bottom right corner.\n    *   Looking at the map: Row 7 is mostly empty. Row 6 has an apple at (6,3) but I'm far right. Row 6 also has `T T` at (7,6) and (6,6)? Wait, let's look at the map again.\n    *   Map Row 6: `. A . . . . T T . A`\n    *   Col 6 is `T`. Col 7 is `T`. These are my body parts (I think? Or maybe enemy? Wait, enemy is on left. My body list shows (7,6) and (6,6). Yes, those are my body).\n    *   So if I go DOWN to (9,7), I am heading down the right edge.\n    *   Next turn, from (9,7), I can go DOWN to (9,6).\n    *   Map Row 6 at col 9 is `A`. (Apple!)\n    *   Map Row 6: `. A . . . . T T . A`. Col 9 is `A`.\n    *   **Crucial:** If I go DOWN now, I can reach that apple at (9,6) next turn (or maybe even this turn? No, it's at y=6).\n    *   Wait, checking my body again. `(7, 6)` is in my list. `(6, 6)` is in my list. `(9, 6)` is currently an Apple according to the map (if the map is accurate to the \"Board State\" description). The prompt says \"Board State\" is the visual map. The visual map Row 6 ends with `. A`. So (9,6) is Apple.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are winning 17-17. We need to keep the lead. Eating apples is good, but staying alive is better.\nGoing **DOWN** clears the path to the bottom right. Going **LEFT** seems to steer me into a corridor formed by my own body. I want to keep options open. The right edge is clear space.\n\nLet's sweep down and grab the apple at (9,6) next.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

This is crucial. We are now in a deadlock. I am on the right edge at (9,6), and the enemy is on the left at (2,6). The board is getting crowded with T (snake body parts) and A (apples).\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES FROM (9,6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9,7):**\n    *   **CHECKING MAP:** Row 7 at x=9 is `T` (My own body). I just moved from (9,7) down to (9,6).\n    *   **RESULT:** **DEATH.** Moving back into the segment I just vacated is illegal.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (8,6):**\n    *   **CHECKING MAP:** Row 6 at x=8 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **CHECKING BODY:** My body is at (7,6) and (6,6) on this row, but (8,6) is clear.\n    *   **OPPONENT:** Snake #0 is at (2,6). Safe distance.\n    *   **RISK ASSESSMENT:** This moves me into the middle of the board. The area around (8,6) is surrounded by my own body on the right (9,6) and my body ahead/left (7,6). While (8,6) is safe *now*, it positions me between my own body segments. I need to be careful not to box myself in.\n    *   **RESULT:** Safe, but potentially restrictive.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (9,5):**\n    *   **CHECKING MAP:** Row 5 at x=9 is `.` (Empty). (The map shows `.` at the far right of row 5).\n    *   **CHECKING BODY:** My body is not at (9,5).\n    *   **OPPONENT:** Snake #0 is at (2,6). Safe.\n    *   **RISK ASSESSMENT:** This keeps me on the edge. From (9,5), I can continue down to (9,4) (which is `.`) or left to (8,5) (which is `T` - enemy body!). Wait, looking at the board state provided:\n        `9 A A . . A . A T T T`\n        `8 . . . . . . . T . T`\n        `7 . . A . . . . T . T`\n        `6 . T 0 . . . T T . 1` (I am at 1, which is (9,6))\n        `5 T T A T T T T . . .` (Row 5: x=9 is `.`)\n        `4 T T T T . T T T T .` (Row 4: x=9 is `.`)\n        `3 A A A T T T A . T .`\n        `2 . . . . T T T T T A`\n        `1 . . A . T T T . A A`\n        `0 . . . . . . . A . .`\n        \n        **CORRECTION:** Looking at the map visually:\n        Row 5 ends with `. . .` (x=7, 8, 9). So (9,5) is empty.\n        Row 4 ends with `. T .` (x=7 is T, x=8 is T?, x=9 is .). Wait, let's look closer at the ASCII map.\n        Row 4: `T T T T . T T T T .` -> x=0-3 is T, x=4 is ., x=5-8 is T, x=9 is `.`. So (9,4) is Empty.\n        \n        **Strategic Value:** Moving DOWN keeps me on the edge. It is the safest route to maintain mobility. Moving LEFT brings me closer to the center where the enemy is.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10,6):**\n    *   **CHECKING MAP:** x=10 is out of bounds.\n    *   **RESULT:** **DEATH.**\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nWe are tied in score (18-18). The enemy is on the left. I need to stay alive and keep my options open. Moving LEFT to (8,6) puts me in a sandwich between my own body at (9,6) behind me and (7,6) to my left. That's a \"corridor\" trap waiting to happen if I'm not careful.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9,5) keeps me on the edge. The edge is the safest place to be when you are the longer snake or when you want to avoid random collisions. From (9,5), I can look for apples down the right side or eventually loop around. The enemy is far away on the left.\n\nLet's hold the edge and keep the flow going.\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the board state.\n\n**BOARD SCAN:**\nCurrent Head: (9, 5)\n- **UP (9, 6):** Blocked. It's my previous body segment (since I just moved DOWN from there). Moving back is suicide. \u274c\n- **DOWN (9, 4):** Map shows `.` (Empty). Safe. But let's check the row below...\n- **LEFT (8, 5):** Map shows `T`. That's Snake #0's body (specifically segment `(4, 5)` looking at the list, but visually on the board it's definitely occupied by the enemy). If I move LEFT, I die. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (10, 5):** Out of bounds. \u274c\n\nWait, let's look closer at the DOWN move.\nRow 4 is `T T T T . T T T T .`\nx=9 on Row 4 is `.` (Empty).\nHowever, look at the apple list: `(7, 0), (1, 9), (1, 3)`. We are hunting the enemy, not the apples. The apples are just obstacles or bait.\nBut wait, looking at the board again:\nRow 5: `T T A T T T T . . .` (x=7, 8, 9 are empty).\nRow 4: `T T T T . T T T T .` (x=9 is empty).\nRow 3: `A A A T T T A . T .` (x=9 is `T`).\n\n**STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:**\nIf I go **DOWN to (9, 4)**:\n- I am safe.\n- My tail moves from `(6, 2)` to `(7, 2)`.\n- The enemy is at `(2, 7)`.\n- The enemy is moving. Where will they go? They are trapped on the left side by their own body and the wall. They have to navigate their tail.\n- If I go DOWN, I am still on the edge. I can continue down next turn if needed.\n- **CRITICAL LOOK:** If I go DOWN to (9, 4), is there an apple there? No.\n- What is my goal? **DOMINATION.** The enemy is on the left. I need to cut off their escape or force a collision.\n\n**RE-EVALUATING MOVES:**\nActually, let's look at the **LEFT (8, 5)** move again. The map shows `T` at (8, 5). That is Snake #0's body. I cannot go there. I die.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMy only legal move is **DOWN** to (9, 4).\nIs (9, 4) safe?\nRow 4: `T T T T . T T T T .`\nThe last character is `.`. Yes, it's empty.\nIs there an apple at (9, 4)? No.\nDo I want to go there? I have to. It's the only move that keeps me alive.\n\n**WAIT!** Let me look at the board again.\nRow 5: `T T A T T T T . . .`\nRow 4: `T T T T . T T T T .`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 4), I am safe.\nNext turn, from (9, 4), my options will be:\n- UP: Back to (9, 5) (Will be empty as my tail moves).\n- DOWN: To (9, 3). Row 3 ends with `. T .` -> x=9 is `T`. (Blocked by my own body!)\n- LEFT: To (8, 4). Row 4 at x=8 is `T`. (Blocked by enemy body!)\n\n**HOLD ON.**\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 4), I am potentially walking into a trap.\nLet's trace the body positions.\nMy body is a long line on the right.\nEnemy body is a messy pile on the left.\n\nLet's look at the ASCII map again.\nRow 5: `T T A T T T T . . .` (Indices 0-9)\nRow 4: `T T T T . T T T T .`\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (9, 4):\n- I am at (9, 4).\n- Next turn, I cannot go RIGHT (Wall).\n- Next turn, I cannot go DOWN (Check Row 3: `A A A T T T A . T .` -> Index 9 is `T`). That is my own body!\n- Next turn, I cannot go LEFT (Check Row 4: Index 8 is `T`). That is enemy body!\n- Next turn, I can only go UP.\n\nThis means **DOWN** leads to a dead end where I am forced to reverse direction next turn. That is dangerous but survivable if the tail moves away.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION:**\nIs there any other move? No. LEFT is enemy body. UP is my previous body. RIGHT is wall.\nI **MUST** go DOWN.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1. **Move DOWN** to (9, 4).\n2. **Next Turn:** I will likely be forced to move UP to (9, 5) because DOWN and LEFT will be blocked by bodies, and RIGHT is a wall.\n3. **Strategy:** Survive. The enemy is on the left. We need to wait for them to make a mistake or for our paths to cross safely.\n\nI am locked in. I have to choose the only legal move.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

T .\nIndex 9 is `.` (Empty).\n\n**CRITICAL CORRECTION!**\nMy reasoning in the previous turn was flawed.\nRow 3: `A A A . T T A . T .`\n`(9, 3)` is x=9, y=3.\nThat cell is `.` (Empty).\n\n**RE-CALCULATING MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (9, 5):** `T` (My body). **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):** `.` (Empty). **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):** `T` (Enemy body). **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):** Wall. **DEAD.**\n\nI HAVE A MOVE! **DOWN** to `(9, 3)`.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am moving into the bottom right corner `(9, 3)`.\nFrom there:\n- UP is `(9, 4)` (Will be empty as my tail moves).\n- DOWN is `(9, 2)`. Map Row 2: ` . . . . T T . T T A`. `(9, 2)` is `A` (Apple).\n- LEFT is `(8, 3)`. Map Row 3: `A A A . T T A . T .`. `(8, 3)` is `T` (Enemy).\n- RIGHT is Wall.\n\nI am forced into a corner, but I can move DOWN to grab an apple next turn if I survive, or UP to retreat. I must survive this turn. The enemy is trapped on the left side `(3, 7)`. They are slow. I just need to keep moving.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMove DOWN to `(9, 3)`.\nThis is the ONLY legal move that doesn't kill me instantly.\nIt sets me up to potentially eat the apple at `(9, 2)` or retreat to `(9, 4)` next turn.\n\nI am boxed in, but I am not dead yet. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

TURN 44!\n\n**SCOREBOARD:**\n*   **US (Snake 1):** 18 Apples \ud83c\udf4e (Down by 1, gotta catch up!)\n*   **ENEMY (Snake 0):** 19 Apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nWe ended last turn moving **DOWN** from `(9, 4)` to `(9, 3)` because we were literally boxed in. Now we are at `(9, 3)`.\nLet's check the board map and calculate our moves.\nThe Enemy (Snake #0) is currently at `(4, 7)`. They are still in the middle-left.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM (9, 3):**\n\n**1. UP: (9, 4)**\n*   **Coordinates:** `(9, 4)` is the cell I just came from. My tail `(8, 2)` will move, but `(9, 4)` was the previous head position. It will be empty.\n*   **Map Check:** Map Row 4: `T T T T . T T T T 1` (Indices 0-9). At `(9, 4)` the map currently shows `1` (my head). The map shows `.` at `(8, 4)` (Enemy), `.` at `(9, 3)` (Empty), `.` at `(10, 4)` (Wall). `(9, 4)` is *not* a static obstacle.\n*   **Body Check:** My previous body segment was `(9, 4)`. As long as my tail moves, this cell becomes empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**2. DOWN: (9, 2)**\n*   **Coordinates:** `(9, 2)`\n*   **Map Check:** Map Row 2: `. . . . T T . T T A`. Index 9 is `A` (Apple). `(9, 2)` is an apple!\n*   **Body Check:** `(9, 2)` is currently empty on the map (represented by the Apple). It is not my body. **SAFE.**\n\n**3. LEFT: (8, 3)**\n*   **Coordinates:** `(8, 3)`\n*   **Map Check:** Map Row 3: `A A A . T T A . T .`. Index 8 is `T` (Enemy body).\n*   **Body Check:** `(8, 3)` is part of Snake #0's body. **DEAD.**\n\n**4. RIGHT: (10, 3)**\n*   **Coordinates:** `x=10`, `y=3`\n*   **Map Check:** Out of bounds (0-9). **DEAD.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n*   **UP (9, 4)**: Safe retreat. Sets up future movement.\n*   **DOWN (9, 2)**: Safe + Apple. This puts my head at `(9, 2)`.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI am in the bottom right corner `(9, 3)`.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(9, 2)` (Apple):\n*   Next turn I will be at `(9, 2)`.\n*   From `(9, 2)`:\n    *   UP: `(9, 3)` (Will be empty).\n    *   DOWN: `(9, 1)` (Map Row 1: `. . A . T T . . A A` -> `(9, 1)` is `A`! Another apple!).\n    *   LEFT: `(8, 2)` (Map Row 2: `(8, 2)` is `T` (Enemy body) -> **DEAD**).\n    *   RIGHT: Wall.\n*   This is a \"Snake Highway\" along the right edge. I can keep going DOWN eating apples at `(9, 2)` -> `(9, 1)`.\n\nIf I go **UP** to `(9, 4)`:\n*   I lose momentum. I loop back into my own body path. I'm not gaining score.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need points to catch up to the enemy (18 vs 19). The enemy is moving slowly on the left. I am safe on the right. I must take the apple.\n**GO DOWN** to `(9, 2)`.\n\nThis is the aggressive play. I'm eating my way down the wall while the enemy is stuck in traffic.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to secure the apple and set up for another apple at `(9, 1)` next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Body stretches up the right edge and loops around.\n**Enemy Position:** Head at (5, 7), body snaking through the center-left.\n\n**Board Analysis (Right Edge):**\n*   **UP (9, 3):** Currently shows `.` on the map (empty), but my previous segment was (9, 3). Since I just moved down to (9, 2), my tail (8, 2) will move out. (9, 3) will become empty. This is safe.\n*   **DOWN (9, 1):** The map shows an `A` (apple) here. If I go down, I eat and grow! However, I need to check the enemy's potential move. The enemy is at (5, 7). To threaten (9, 1), they would need to move 4 spaces in one turn, which is impossible. (9, 1) is safe from immediate collision.\n*   **LEFT (8, 2):** The map shows a `T` (enemy body) at (8, 2). If I move here, I die. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT:** Out of bounds. **DEAD.**\n\n**Safety Check:**\nThe only safe moves are **UP** and **DOWN**.\n\n**Strategy:**\n*   **Option A (UP):** Moves to (9, 3). No apple. Sets up a weird position where my head is sandwiched between my own body at (9, 4) and the wall.\n*   **Option B (DOWN):** Moves to (9, 1). Grabs an apple (+1 score, 20 total). This leads to a \"highway\" along the bottom edge. From (9, 1), I can continue DOWN to (9, 0) (there's an apple at 7,0 but 9,0 is empty and safe).\n\n**Head-to-Head Risk:**\nThe enemy is far away. A head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to break the tie! The apple at (9, 1) is ripe for the taking. Moving DOWN keeps me on the edge, maximizing my space and avoiding the cluttered center where the enemy is.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (9, 1). Next turn, assess moving to (9, 0) or wrapping around.\n\nTime to move!\n\nDOWN",

We just ate that apple at (9, 1)!\n- **My Head:** Now at (9, 1) after eating the apple\n- **Enemy Head:** Still at (5, 8) - they haven't moved yet this turn\n- **Body Update:** My tail (8, 2) should be moving out since I grew, making (8, 2) empty\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP (9, 2):** That's my current body position! Moving backwards into myself = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n- **LEFT (8, 1):** Check the map... shows '.' (empty). But wait! My body currently snakes through here. Let me trace: Head (9,1) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 ... (8,4) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (8,2). So (8,1) should be empty! \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN (9, 0):** Bottom-right corner. Map shows '.' - empty. But is it safe? There's an apple at (7,0) but that's not my target. Moving to corner limits future moves. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT:** Off board = DEATH \u274c\n\n**Strategic Thinking:**\nI need to maintain my lead while keeping options open. The enemy is at (5,8) - they're NOT close enough to threaten me immediately. \n\nLooking at the board: (8,1) gives me access to the bottom-left area where there are apples at (7,0) and (0,3). Meanwhile, (9,0) traps me in the corner with only one escape route (LEFT to 8,0).\n\n**The Play:** LEFT to (8,1) keeps me flexible and moves me toward more apples while avoiding corner traps. I maintain board control and can chase apples in multiple directions next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Stay aggressive, keep the score lead, and force the enemy into cramped spaces. We're winning this! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

After the move we\u2019ll have three viable exits (left, right, down) and stay far from the opponent\u2019s wall of segments at column\u202f7\u20119.  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,\u202f8)** \u2013 also safe, but it leads us into a tighter corridor; the only immediate apple is at (4,\u202f9) and the space on the left side is quickly filled by our own tail, risking a self\u2011trap.  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,\u202f8)** \u2013 safe now, but the next step to the right hits the opponent\u2019s body at (7,\u202f8). We\u2019d be forced to turn down or up immediately, limiting flexibility.  \n\n\u274c **DOWN** is our own body (5,\u202f7) \u2192 illegal.  \n\n**Opponent\u2019s likely move:** Head at (9,\u202f1) will probably go **LEFT** to (8,\u202f1) for the apple, staying far away from our region. No head\u2011on danger this turn.\n\n**Strategic aim:** Grab an apple on the top row ASAP to tie the score (20\u201120) and keep the board\u2019s upper\u2011right corridor open for a future cut\u2011off. Moving **UP** gives us the most options and the best chance to dominate the high\u2011ground.\n\n**Decision:** Go up.\n\nUP",

Their head at (5,9) is RIGHT at the top edge near my old path.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n```\n9 A A . . A 0 A T T T\n8 . A . . . T . T . T\n7 . A T T T T . T A T\n6 . T T . . . T T .

Moving backwards = instant death. \u274c\n- **DOWN (8,0):** Empty cell! Good option. Opens up bottom area where apple (7,0) is nearby. \u2705\n- **LEFT (7,1):** Empty cell! Check board... shows '.' empty. Opens toward left side. \u2705\n- **RIGHT (9,1):** That's where my body starts! Moving into my own body = death. \u274c\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nEnemy is at (5,9) - they're going for the top-left apples. I'm at (8,1) - bottom-right area. I have TWO safe moves: DOWN to (8,0) or LEFT to (7,1).\n\nLet me think long-term:\n- (8,0) gets me to bottom corner, I can then move LEFT to (7,0) to eat that apple! That's a clear path.\n- (7,1) moves me toward the center where the apple at (1,3) is, but it's further away.\n\nThe apple at (7,0) is RIGHT THERE! I can eat it next turn if I go DOWN now. Meanwhile, the enemy is busy at the top. This lets me expand my lead and control the bottom area.\n\n**THE PLAY:** DOWN to (8,0) \u2192 then LEFT to (7,0) for the apple! Let's get that score gap wider!\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Dominate the bottom-right corner, eat the apple at (7,0), then use that position to cut off enemy's access to the center. Keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN\n**END MOVE RATIONALE**",

That's the bottom edge, NOT the top edge!\n\nLet me re-examine MY BODY from the description:\n- Head: (8, 0)\n- Body: [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]\n\n**OH SNAP!** My body wraps around from (9,9) top-right corner down to (8,0) bottom-right! So:\n- (8,1) is MY BODY (second segment from head)\n- (9,1) is MY BODY (third segment)\n- (7,0) is empty (no apple there, that's from the old list!)\n- (7,1) is empty\n\n**Safe moves from (8,0):**\n- **UP (8,1):** MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 Instant death.\n- **DOWN (8,-1):** Off the board! \ud83d\udc80 Death.\n- **LEFT (7,0):** Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n- **RIGHT (9,0):** Empty! \u2705 Safe.\n\n**Enemy at (4,9)** is way up top-left. I'm at bottom-right (8,0). Let me think:\n\n**Option 1: LEFT to (7,0)**\n- Moves me toward the center\n- Opens up path to (6,0), (5,0) etc\n- Gets me away from my own tail (which goes up the right side)\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (9,0)**\n- Takes me to bottom-right corner\n- My body is already on (9,1) above it\n- This might trap me in the corner!\n\n**THE DECISION:** LEFT to (7,0) is smarter! Right now I'm at the edge, going right to (9,0) would put me in a corner with my body above and to the right. Going LEFT gives me more board to work with and keeps options open to move toward the center where apples are.\n\n**Strategic Note:** I need to be careful not to get boxed in. My body is spread across the right side of the board from (9,1) to (9,9), so moving away from that wall is good. Enemy is far away at top-left, so no immediate threat. I'll go LEFT and see if I can find an apple in the center-left area to keep the score lead.\n\n**CHAT! WE'RE GOING LEFT!** That's the play! Left to (7,0) keeps us alive and gives us breathing room. Let's go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

LEADING! \ud83c\udfc6\n- My body snakes up the RIGHT side: (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)... all the way to (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), down to (8,3)\n- My head at (7,0) - bottom row, just left of my body at (8,0)\n\n**Safe Moves from (7,0):**\n- UP to (7,1): Empty! \u2705\n- DOWN to (7,-1): Off board! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD\n- LEFT to (6,0): Empty! \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (8,0): MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD\n\n**Opponent at (3,9) - Top left corner**\nTheir body snakes down-left: (4,9), (5,9), (5,8)... They're in the top-left quadrant.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nI need to dominate! My body is wrapped around the RIGHT side of the board. If I go UP to (7,1), I'm heading toward the center where there are apples at (6,2), (7,3), etc. This opens up multiple escape routes and gets me closer to food while keeping away from my own tail that's all over the right side.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,0) is also safe but takes me further from the action and toward the bottom-left empty space. Less optimal for reaching apples in the next few turns.\n\n**THE CALL:** UP to (7,1)! This keeps me in the game, moves toward apples, and maintains flexibility. Let's keep this lead and pressure the enemy! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue moving UP/LEFT to navigate toward center-left apples ((6,2), (7,3), etc.) while monitoring opponent's position. Avoid getting trapped against my own tail on the right side. Force engagement if I maintain lead.\n\nUP",

Wait, let's trace properly from head (7,1):\n  - Body list: [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)]\n  - Actually from board, at (7,1) I see \"1\" on the board (my head). My body at (7,0) is \"T\" (tail). Wait, the board shows my head at (7,1) with body at (7,0) below it? Let me cross-reference.\n  - From board: row 1 (y=1): positions: x=0 \".\", x=1 \".\", x=2 \"A\" (apple), x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \".\", x=6 \"A\" (apple), x=7 \"1\" (my head), x=8 \"T\" (tail), x=9 \"T\" (tail). So my head is at (7,1), immediate body below at (7,0)? But (7,0) is \".\" on the board. Hmm.\n  - Let's trust the body list: my body goes from (7,0) [tail] to (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), ... up to (9,9), then (8,9), (7,9), etc. So my body forms a C-shape around the right side, with the head at (7,1) pointing left/down? Actually, the head (7,1) connects to (7,0) [tail]. So the \"body\" is the tail moving up right: (7,0) -> (8,0) -> (8,1) -> (9,1) ... to (9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9) -> (7,8) -> (7,7) -> (7,6) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (7,4) -> (8,4). That's a long snake! The head (7,1) is \"behind\" the body on the right? Actually, the tail is at (7,0), and the head is at (7,1), so the snake is moving \"up\" from (7,0) to (7,1) as head. The body then continues from (7,0) to (8,0), etc. So the head is at (7,1), and the body is the tail going right and up.\n  - From the board, we see \"T\" at (8,1) and (9,1), which are part of the body. Also \"T\" at (0,0) and (1,0) and (2,0)? Actually row 0 has \"T T .\" at x=8,9? Row 0: x=7 \".\", x=8 \"T\", x=9 \".\". So (8,0) and (9,0) are not \"T\"? Wait, board shows row 0: x=0 \".\", x=1 \".\", x=2 \".\", x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \".\", x=6 \".\", x=7 \".\", x=8 \"T\", x=9 \".\". So (8,0) is \"T\", (9,0) is \".\".\n  - But from body list: (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1)... So (7,0) is tail, (8,0) is part of body, (8,1) is part of body, (9,1) is part of body. But on board, (7,0) is \".\"? Actually, on board row 0 (y=0): x=7 is \".\", x=8 is \"T\", x=9 is \".\". So maybe the board shows the tail as \"T\" at (8,0) but (7,0) is empty? That seems odd. Let's assume the board is accurate for current positions. Possibly the tail is at (8,0) and the body extends from there? But body list says last tuple is (8,4). Actually, the list is head-to-tail: first is head (7,1), last is tail? The description says \"last one is the tail.\" In the list: \"Body: [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)]\". It says \"head: (7,1)\", but then body list starts with (7,0)? That seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the body list includes the head? No, description: \"Head: (7, 1)\" and \"Body: [list]\" separate. So the body list is the segments after the head. Typically in snake, head is first in a list, but here they separate it. So the full snake from head to tail is: head (7,1), then (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), ... (8,4) [tail]. So the tail is at (8,4). But on board, (8,4) is \"T\" (row 4, x=8: \"T\"). Yes! Row 4 (y=4): x=8 is \"T\". So that matches. And (7,0) is not on the board because it's the segment after head? Actually (7,0) is on the board as \".\"? Row 0 (y=0), x=7 is \".\", but (7,0) is a body segment? Maybe the board doesn't show all body segments? Or I'm misreading. Let's check row 0: x=0 \".\", x=1 \".\", x=2 \".\", x=3 \".\", x=4 \".\", x=5 \".\", x=6 \".\", x=7 \".\", x=8 \"T\", x=9 \".\". So (8,0) is \"T\", but (7,0) is \".\"? That suggests (7,0) might not be occupied. Possibly the body list is not fully represented on the board? The board is a snapshot, maybe some body parts are hidden? Actually, the board shows \"T\" for opponent's body and \"1\" for my head, but for my body, it shows \"T\" as well? Let's see: on row 1, x=8 and x=9 are \"T\", which are my body? From body list, (8,1) and (9,1) are in the list, so yes. On row 0, (8,0) is \"T\", which is in the list. (7,0) is not shown as \"T\" on the board, but it is in the body list. So the board is not fully accurate? Or maybe (7,0) is not occupied because it's the segment that just moved? This is confusing. Given the board is provided, I should trust the board for current positions. The board shows my head at (7,1), and some \"T\"s that likely represent my body (e.g., (8,1), (9,1), (8,0) etc.). The opponent's body is shown as \"0\"? Actually, opponent's head is \"0\" on the board? Board shows at (2,9) \"0\" (since row 9: \"A A 0 T T T A T T T\", so x=2 is \"0\", that's opponent's head). And their body is shown as \"T\". So for my snake, the board uses \"1\" for head and \"T\" for body? Possibly, but at (7,0) it's \".\" not \"T\". So maybe (7,0) is not occupied. Let's look at the opponent's body: on row 9, x=3,4,5 are \"T\" which matches their body list (3,9),(4,9),(5,9). So \"T\" is used for opponent's body. For my snake, the board also uses \"T\" for my body? At (8,1) and (9,1) it's \"T\", so yes. But why is (7,0) not \"T\"? Possibly because the body list includes (7,0) but it's the segment immediately after the head? Actually, if head is at (7,1), then the next segment is at (7,0) (the cell below). That should be part of the body. But on the board, (7,0) is \".\", meaning empty. That suggests the board might not be showing all body parts, or there's a discrepancy. Given the board is the official state, I'll go by the board. So from the board, my head is at (7,1). What cells around me are occupied by my body? I see \"T\" at (8,1) (right), (9,1) (far right), (8,0) (below-right). But (7,0) (directly below) is \".\", so not occupied. Also, (6,1) (left) is \"A\" (apple). (7,2) (up) is \"A\" (apple). So from the board, my immediate surroundings: DOWN (7,0) is empty, LEFT (6,1) is apple, RIGHT (8,1) is my body (T), UP (7,2) is apple.\n\nBut wait, the body list says (7,0) is part of the body, so it should be occupied. This is a conflict. I need to resolve this. The board is likely the ground truth for collision detection. The body list might be the full snake, but the board is a simplified view? Possibly the board only shows \"T\" for opponent's body, and for my snake, it shows \"T\" for body but maybe not all segments? Actually, looking at row 0, x=8 is \"T\", which matches (8,0) in body list. x=7 is \".\", but (7,0) is in body list. So the board omits (7,0) as \"T\". That seems like an inconsistency. Maybe the board is showing the state after previous moves, and (7,0) is actually empty because the tail moved? Let's think: If the head moves, the tail also moves (if no apple eaten). In turn 49, the last move was UP from (7,0) to (7,1). So at turn 49, head was at (7,0). Then after moving UP to (7,1) at turn 50, the tail would also have moved? Actually, we are at the start of turn 50. The board is the current state at turn 50. The last move was UP (from turn 49 to 50). So at the start of turn 50, head is at (7,1). The body would be the previous head position (7,0) and the rest shifted. But since the tail moves, (7,0) might still be occupied until the tail moves away? Actually, in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves from the old tail, so the cell behind the head (7,0) becomes the new first body segment. So (7,0) should be occupied by my body. But the board shows it as empty. Possibly the board is from before the move? No, it says \"Board State\" for current turn. Given the confusion, I'll trust the body list for which cells are occupied by my snake, as that's the definitive snake state. So my body occupies: (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4). And head at (7,1). So (7,0) is occupied. Therefore, moving DOWN to (7,0) is moving into my own body -> death. LEFT to (6,1) is empty (apple, but also body? Not in list). RIGHT to (8,1) is body -> death. UP to (7,2) is empty (apple). So safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow, opponent's position: head at (2,9), body along (3,9) to (5,9), then (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). So their body is in the top-left and center. They are not near my head (7,1) currently.\n\nApples: many apples on the board. Important ones near me: (6,1) left, (7,2) up, (6,2) up-left, (7,3) up-up, etc.\n\nNow, I need to choose between UP to (7,2) and LEFT to (6,1). Both are apples, so I'll grow either way. Which gives better future options?\n\nConsider future moves after UP to (7,2):\n- From (7,2), safe moves? Look around: UP (7,3) is apple (but empty). DOWN (7,1) would be occupied by my body? After moving, the body shifts: current head at (7,1) becomes body, so (7,1) will be occupied. So DOWN would be into my own body -> death. LEFT (6,2) is empty (apple). RIGHT (8,2) is? Board: row 2 (y=2): x=8 is \"T\" (my body? Actually row 2: x=7 \"A\", x=8 \".\", x=9 \"T\"? Wait row 2: \" . . . . . . A . . T\" so x=7 is \"A\", x=8 is \".\", x=9 is \"T\". But from body list, (8,4) is tail, (9,4) is body? Actually (9,4) is in body list. (8,2) is not in body list. So (8,2) might be empty. But we need to check if it's occupied by opponent. Opponent body is not there. So RIGHT is possible. Also, after moving to (7,2), the tail moves, so some cells become free. Overall, from (7,2) I have multiple options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (6,1):\n- From (6,1), safe moves? UP (6,2) is apple, DOWN (6,0) is? Row 0: x=6 is \".\", so empty. LEFT (5,1) is? Row 1: x=5 is \".\", so empty. RIGHT (7,1) would be occupied by my body (since after move, (7,1) becomes body segment) -> death. So options: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Also, moving LEFT to (6,1) gets me closer to the left side, which might be safer long-term? But I'm already on the right side with a long body. Moving left might help me clear space or avoid being trapped by my own body.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- I'm leading 22-20. I want to maintain lead and potentially force a collision where I win. But I need to survive.\n- My body is wrapped around the right side. If I keep going right or up, I might trap myself against my own tail. Moving left could give me more room.\n- The board has many apples. I can grow to 30 and win, but I need to avoid dying.\n- Opponent is in the top-left. If I move left/up, I might move toward them, but we're far apart.\n- Consider long-term: I need to avoid dead ends. My tail is at (8,4). If I move left, I might be able to loop around and eat apples without getting stuck.\n- Also, note that apples are at (6,1), (7,2), (6,2), (7,3), etc. If I go UP to (7,2), I can then go to (6,2) or (7,3) or (8,2). If I go LEFT to (6,1), I can go to (6,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\nLet's check safety from immediate opponent: opponent is at (2,9) and moving next turn. They might move down or left. Since we're far apart, no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nI need to consider if the opponent might try to box me in. But given the board, I have space.\n\nAlso, note that moving UP to (7,2) puts me closer to the apple at (7,3) and also near (6,3) which is an apple? Actually (6,3) is listed as an apple drop, but on board row 3, x=6 is \"A\"? Row 3: \"A A A . . . A A . T\" so x=6 is \"A\". So yes.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,1) gets me an apple immediately and also near (5,1) which is empty, (6,2) apple, etc.\n\nBoth moves are good. But which gives better escape routes? From (7,2), I have three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). From (6,1), I have three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). However, from (6,1), moving DOWN to (6,0) might lead to a dead end? (6,0) is empty, and from there I could go left to (5,0), up to (6,1) (occupied by body after move), etc. It might be okay.\n\nBut consider my body: if I move LEFT to (6,1), my head moves left, and my tail will move. The tail is at (8,4). Moving left doesn't immediately threaten my tail.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (6,1), so I'll grow. If I go UP to (7,2), I also grow.\n\nI need to think about the opponent's potential moves. The opponent might be going for apples in the center. If I move UP, I'm moving toward the center, which might increase risk of meeting them. But they are far.\n\nAnother factor: I might want to avoid moving into a position where the opponent could easily head-on collision me. Since I'm ahead, if we collide heads, I win (because I have more apples). So actually, I want to encourage a head-on collision if possible. But it's hard to force that because they move simultaneously.\n\nMaybe I should position myself to block the opponent's path or force them into a corner.\n\nLooking at the board, the opponent's head is at (2,9). They might want to go down or right. If I move UP, I'm going away from them. If I move LEFT, I'm moving toward them somewhat.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate. Both moves are safe and grow me. I'll choose one that gives more flexibility.\n\nI notice that from (7,2), I can go RIGHT to (8,2), which is empty and might lead to more apples. But from (6,1), I can go LEFT to (5,1) which is empty and less crowded.\n\nGiven my body is on the right side, moving LEFT might help me avoid being trapped by my own body. For example, if I go UP to (7,2), I might later go LEFT to (6,2), but then my body will fill the right side, and I might have limited space. If I go LEFT now, I can start moving leftward and perhaps clear some of my body from the right side.\n\nActually, by moving LEFT to (6,1), my tail moves, and the body shifts. The tail at (8,4) moves to (8,5)? No, the tail moves based on growth. Since I'm eating an apple, I grow, so the tail does not move; I add a segment. So after eating, my body will be one segment longer, and the tail remains at (8,4) for this turn. Next turn, when I move, the tail will not move because I grew. So moving LEFT to (6,1) will cause my body to extend by one segment, but the tail stays. That might help me fill space.\n\nBut in the long run, I want to keep the board open for myself.\n\nLet's consider a long-term plan: I need to get to 30 apples. There are many apples on the board. I should aim to eat apples while avoiding getting trapped. My current body is large (22 segments). I have to be careful not to coil too much.\n\nI think moving LEFT to (6,1) is slightly better because it moves me toward the left side, which is less occupied. From the board, the left side has fewer \"T\"s. It also gets me an apple and opens up more moves: I can then go to (5,1), (6,0), (6,2), etc. This might give me more breathing room.\n\nIf I go UP to (7,2), I'm closer to the center, but I might get boxed in by my own body if I keep going up.\n\nLet's check the board for empty spaces: The left side (x<4) has many empty spots. The right side is crowded with my body.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT seems strategic.\n\nAlso, note that the apple at (6,1) is closer to the opponent? Not really, opponent is at (2,9).\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the last move was UP. If I move LEFT, that's fine.\n\nI need to ensure I'm not moving into a trap. Let's simulate a few moves after LEFT to (6,1):\n- Next turn, from (6,1), I can go to (5,1) (empty), (6,0) (empty), or (6,2) (apple). All safe.\n- If I go to (5,1), then from there I can go to (4,1), (5,0), (5,2), etc. Still plenty of space.\n- I can work my way leftward, eating apples along the way, and eventually maybe turn up or down.\n\nWhereas if I go UP to (7,2):\n- Next turn, I can go to (6,2) (apple), (7,3) (apple), or (8,2) (empty). (8,2) might be okay, but (8,2) is near my body? Not immediately. But (8,2) is close to (8,3) which is empty? Row 3: x=8 is \"A\"? Actually row 3: x=8 is \"A\"? Row 3: \"A A A . . . A A . T\" so x=8 is \"A\". So (8,2) is empty, (8,3) is apple. That's fine. But then I might be moving along the right side again, which is already occupied.\n\nGiven that my body already occupies much of the right side, moving leftward might be safer to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nThus, I decide to move LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Move leftward to escape the crowded right side, eat apples on the left and center, and maintain space. Avoid trapping myself by my own body. Keep an eye on opponent and force a collision if possible later.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT\n**END RATIONALE**LEFT",

We\u2019re on the right side, opponent is on the top-left corner.  \n- Apples: We\u2019re surrounded by apples on the right (6,2), (7,3), (5,0) etc., but the left side has more breathing room.  \n- Our body: C\u2011shape on the right. Head at (6,1). Immediate neighbors:  \n  - **UP (6,2)** \u2013 Apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - **DOWN (6,0)** \u2013 Empty (we see a \u201c.\u201d on the board).  \n  - **LEFT (5,1)** \u2013 Empty (also \u201c.\u201d).  \n  - **RIGHT (7,1)** \u2013 Our own body (marked \u201cT\u201d on the board).  \n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**  \n- RIGHT (7,1) is our own body \u2013 instant death. \u274c  \n- All other directions are off\u2011board safe.  \n\n**EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP (6,2) \u2013 Apple!**  \n   - Pros: Grows us, +1 point, maybe pulls us closer to central apples.  \n   - Cons: After eating, head at (6,2). Next turn options? From (6,2) we could go UP to (6,3) \u2013 that\u2019s an apple, but (6,3) is surrounded? Let\u2019s see: (6,3) is an apple, but (5,3) is empty, (7,3) is apple, (6,4) is our own body (T). So from (6,2) we might get trapped by our own body if we keep going up. Also, (6,2) is still on the right side where our body is crowded.  \n\n2. **DOWN (6,0) \u2013 Empty**  \n   - Pros: Moves us to the bottom row, opens up many new paths (left, down, up).  \n   - Cons: No apple immediately, but we can plan to eat later.  \n\n3. **LEFT (5,1) \u2013 Empty**  \n   - Pros: Moves us away from the crowded right side, toward the left where there\u2019s more space. Opens up more future options.  \n   - Cons: No immediate apple, but (5,1) is adjacent to apples at (6,2) (up-right) and (5,0) (down) \u2013 both reachable next turn.  \n\n**LONG\u2011TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re ahead by 2 apples. Our goal is **not just to eat apples, but to force the opponent into a trap.** The opponent is in the top\u2011left corner with a long body. If we stay on the right, we risk getting boxed in by our own body. Moving **LEFT** to (5,1) shifts us to the left\u2011center, where we have more room to maneuver. From there, we can:  \n- Head to (4,1), (3,1), etc., eating apples along the way.  \n- Keep the opponent confined to the top-left.  \n- If they try to come down, we can cut them off or force a head\u2011on collision (remember, we\u2019re heavier \u2013 we win that trade).  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- UP gives a apple now, but limits future moves.  \n- DOWN moves us to a corner (bottom), which could become a dead\u2011end later.  \n- LEFT gives us the most flexibility and keeps us away from our own body.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 DECISION:** We choose **LEFT** to open up the board, avoid self\u2011collisions, and position ourselves for future growth.  \n\n**LONG\u2011TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nFrom (5,1), assess if opponent is coming down. If they\u2019re still in the top, we can go LEFT again to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) (apple nearby). If they rush, we prepare a head\u2011on collision \u2013 we have the size advantage.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT",

Safe.  \n\n**EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP (5,2)**:  \n   - Pros: Puts us in the center (x=5,y=2), opens up paths to apples like (5,0) (down) and (6,2) (right).  \n   - Cons: (5,2) is **close to opponent\u2019s territory**? Their body is at (5,4), (5,5), etc.\u2014we\u2019re not too close yet.  \n   - Future options: From (5,2), we can go UP to (5,3) (empty), LEFT to (4,2), RIGHT to (6,2) (apple), or DOWN back to (5,1). **Multiple safe moves**.  \n\n2. **DOWN (5,0)**:  \n   - Pros: Goes to bottom row, might open up new paths.  \n   - Cons: (5,0) is a **dead-end**. From there, only LEFT (4,0) or RIGHT (6,0) are safe (both empty). UP is (5,1) (our body, but we just left it, so that\u2019s **backwards into our own body**\u2014DEADLY!). So if we go DOWN, we\u2019ll be trapped. **Avoid**.  \n\n3. **LEFT (4,1)**:  \n   - Pros: Moves us away from our crowded right side, toward the left where apples are (like (2,1), (0,3), etc.).  \n   - Cons: (4,1) is empty, but we need to watch opponent\u2019s movement. From (4,1), we can go LEFT to (3,1), DOWN to (4,0), UP to (4,2), or RIGHT back to (5,1). **Multiple safe moves**.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re ahead by 1 apple. We need to **dominate the board and force opponent into a corner**. The opponent is already in the top-left\u2014we should **push left to cut off their escape** while staying central to keep options open. If we go LEFT, we\u2019ll be closer to apples at (2,1) and (0,3), and we can start encircling their territory. **Aggressive positioning!**  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- UP: Safe, but we stay near the center. Might not pressure opponent.  \n- DOWN: Dangerous\u2014dead-end. Avoid.  \n- LEFT: Safe, advances our position toward opponent\u2019s weak spot.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 DECISION:** We choose **LEFT** to push the advantage, stay mobile, and prepare to trap the enemy.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nFrom (4,1), evaluate opponent\u2019s move. If they stay in top-left, continue LEFT to (3,1) and approach apples. If they try to drop down, cut them off and force a head-on collision (we have the size advantage!). Remember: **aggression wins games.**  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT",

We\u2019re **tied** after the opponent likely ate an apple last turn. We need to pull ahead or force a collision where we win.  \n- Board: 10x10. We\u2019re at (4,1) after moving LEFT last turn. Opponent is at (1,7) with a long body stretching across the top.  \n- Apples: The closest apple to us is at (2,1) (LEFT), (0,3) (LEFT-UP), and (5,0) (DOWN). But remember, **apples are secondary**\u2014we need to dominate space and trap the enemy.  \n- Enemy position: Their head is at (1,7), body snakes down to (5,4). They\u2019re still **pinned in the top-left corner**. We should keep pushing left to cut off their escape routes.  \n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**  \n- LEFT (3,1): Empty on board? Let\u2019s check the board state. Row 1 (y=1): \u201c.\u201d at (3,1) \u2014 yes, it\u2019s empty. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (5,1): That\u2019s our own body (we just left it, and it\u2019s part of our long tail). Moving BACK into our own body = instant death. \u274c  \n- UP (4,2): Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (4,2) \u2014 empty. Safe.  \n- DOWN (4,0): Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (4,0) \u2014 empty. Safe.  \n\n**EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **LEFT (3,1)**:  \n   - Pros: Brings us closer to apples at (2,1) and (0,3). Puts us in a prime position to **box in the opponent** from the left side. From (3,1), we can go LEFT to (2,1) (apple), UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), or RIGHT back to (4,1). **Multiple safe moves**.  \n   - Cons: None immediate.  \n   - **Aggression factor**: High. We\u2019re closing the gap on their territory.  \n\n2. **UP (4,2)**:  \n   - Pros: Moves us toward the center. From there, we can go LEFT to (3,2), RIGHT to (5,2), or UP to (4,3). Safe options.  \n   - Cons: Doesn\u2019t pressure the opponent as directly. We stay in neutral space.  \n\n3. **DOWN (4,0)**:  \n   - Pros: Takes us to the bottom row. From there, we can go LEFT to (3,0) or RIGHT to (5,0).  \n   - Cons: Fewer escape routes if the opponent pushes down later. We\u2019re moving away from their territory.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re tied. We need to **force the opponent into a corner** and make them crash into us. By moving LEFT, we advance toward their weak spot and cut off potential escape paths. From (3,1), we can continue left to (2,1) and (1,1), aiming to **wall off the left side** while keeping central options open. If the opponent tries to drop down, we\u2019ll be positioned to intercept.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- LEFT: Safe, advances our position, and applies pressure.  \n- UP: Safe but passive.  \n- DOWN: Safe but less strategic.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 DECISION:** We choose **LEFT** to aggressively push toward the opponent\u2019s territory and maintain board control.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nFrom (3,1), watch the opponent\u2019s move. If they stay in the top-left, continue left to (2,1) and start forming a barrier. If they try to drop down or move right, be ready to cut them off. Remember: **aggression wins games**\u2014force them into a bad position and make them crash!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT",

We need to **pull ahead** or force a collision where we win.  \n- Board: We\u2019re at (3, 1) after moving LEFT last turn. Opponent\u2019s head is at (0, 7). Their body is snaking down from (1, 7) to (5, 5).  \n- Our body is long\u2014we\u2019re stretched from (3, 1) down to (6, 5). Moving into our own body is a risk, so we must **plan carefully**.  \n- Apples are everywhere, but **ignore them**\u2014we\u2019re here to dominate and make the opponent crash!  \n\n**ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**  \n- **RIGHT (4, 1)**: That\u2019s our own body (we just left it). Moving back into ourselves = instant death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT (2, 1)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (2, 1). Empty. Safe.  \n- **UP (3, 2)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (3, 2). Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN (3, 0)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (3, 0). Empty. Safe.  \n\n**EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **LEFT (2, 1)**:  \n   - Pros: Brings us closer to apples at (2, 1) and (0, 3). **Cuts off the opponent\u2019s escape** to the left. From (2, 1), we can go LEFT to (1, 1), UP to (2, 2), or DOWN to (2, 0).  \n   - Cons: None immediate.  \n   - **Aggression factor**: High. We\u2019re advancing on their territory and boxing them in.  \n\n2. **UP (3, 2)**:  \n   - Pros: Moves us toward the center. From there, we can go LEFT to (2, 2), RIGHT to (4, 2), or UP to (3, 3).  \n   - Cons: Less direct pressure on the opponent. We\u2019re staying in neutral space.  \n\n3. **DOWN (3, 0)**:  \n   - Pros: Takes us to the bottom row. From there, we can go LEFT to (2, 0) or RIGHT to (4, 0).  \n   - Cons: Moves us away from the opponent\u2019s territory. Less aggressive.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re tied, and the opponent is trapped in the top-left. By moving LEFT, we **cut off their left side** and force them toward the center or down. From (2, 1), we can continue left to (1, 1) and create a **wall**. If they try to drop down, we\u2019ll be positioned to intercept. Remember: **aggression wins games**\u2014force them into a bad spot and make them crash!  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- LEFT: Safe, advances our position, and applies pressure.  \n- UP: Safe but passive.  \n- DOWN: Safe but less strategic.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 DECISION:** We choose **LEFT** to aggressively push toward the opponent\u2019s territory and maintain board control.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nFrom (2, 1), watch the opponent\u2019s move. If they stay in the top-left, continue left to (1, 1) and start forming a barrier. If they try to drop down or move right, be ready to cut them off. Remember: **aggression wins games**\u2014force them into a bad position and make them crash!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** LEFT",

None intersect our immediate options, so no head\u2011on risk this turn.\n\n- **Future outlook:**  \n  - Moving **UP** puts us one step from the apple at (0,\u202f9). Even though the corner will be tight, we gain a point now and keep the opponent confined to the right side.  \n  - Moving **DOWN** traps us immediately against our own body with no viable exit on the following turn.  \n  - Therefore **UP** is the only move that gives any chance of extra growth before the inevitable squeeze.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Go **UP** to (0,\u202f8).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If the apple at (0,\u202f9) is still there next turn, gobble it and grow.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Afterwards, look for a corridor down the left wall while the opponent battles on the far side.\n\n**Decision:**  \n\nUP",

Opponent\u2019s head is at **(0, 8)**.  \n- Our body is **blocking a lot of space** \u2013 we\u2019re basically a wall from (2,1) down to (6,6). Gotta avoid ourselves.  \n- Apples exist, but **we dominate by control, not greed**. Force opponent into a trap!  \n\n**\ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**  \n- **RIGHT (3, 1)**: That\u2019s our own body!

Opponent might slip down.  \n\n3. **DOWN (2, 0)**:  \n   - Pros: Takes us to bottom row. From (2,0), we can go LEFT (1,0) or RIGHT (3,0).  \n   - Cons: **Moves away from opponent**.

If they stay top-left, we continue LEFT to (0,1) and seal the left edge. If they try to escape right, we move UP to block. **We own the board now.**  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 FINAL DECISION:**  \nAggression wins. **LEFT** to tighten the noose.  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nLEFT",

It's a tie! \ud83d\udc80 We gotta break this deadlock.  \n- Our head: **(1, 1)** after moving LEFT last turn.  \n- Opponent head: **(0, 9)** \u2013 they\u2019re in the top-left corner, but they have a long body stretching down.  \n- Board: We\u2019re on row 1, column 1. We\u2019re **right next to the left wall** \u2013 moving LEFT would crash us into the wall (illegal).  \n- Our body: We\u2019re a massive wall stretching from (2,1) to (6,6). We gotta avoid ourselves.  \n- Apples: Tons on the board, but we\u2019re not greedy \u2013 we want to **trap the opponent** and force a head-on collision where we win (since we\u2019re tied, we need to be the survivor).  \n\n**\ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE DEADLY MOVES:**  \n- **LEFT (0, 1)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (0, 1), but moving LEFT from (1,1) goes to (0,1). However, (0,1) is on the edge. But is it illegal? No, it\u2019s inside the board. Wait, but the board shows (0,1) is \u201c.\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s empty. BUT, our body is not there. However, check the board: row 1 column 0 is \u201c.\u201d \u2013 empty. So LEFT is **not illegal**. However, moving LEFT puts us against the wall, which might trap us later.  \n- **RIGHT (2, 1)**: That\u2019s our own body! We\u2019re at (1,1) and our body goes to (2,1), (3,1), etc. Moving RIGHT would be moving into (2,1) which is our own body. **DEATH**. \u274c  \n- **UP (1, 2)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (1,2). Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN (1, 0)**: Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (1,0). Empty. Safe.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 EVALUATE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **LEFT (0, 1)**:  \n   - Pros: Gets us to the left wall. We can then move UP or DOWN along the wall.  \n   - Cons: We\u2019re cornering ourselves. If opponent moves down, we might not be able to chase.  \n   - **Aggression**: Moderate. We\u2019re not directly pressuring the opponent.  \n\n2. **UP (1, 2)**:  \n   - Pros: Moves us upward, closer to the opponent who is at (0,9). From (1,2), we can go UP to (1,3) which has an apple (board shows (1,3) is \u201cA\u201d). Also, we can move LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2).  \n   - Cons: None immediate.  \n   - **Aggression**: HIGH. We\u2019re moving toward the opponent\u2019s territory.  \n\n3. **DOWN (1, 0)**:  \n   - Pros: Moves us to the bottom row. From there, we can go LEFT or RIGHT.  \n   - Cons: Moves us away from the opponent. We\u2019re giving them room to breathe.  \n   - **Aggression**: LOW. Not ideal when we\u2019re tied and want to force a collision.  \n\n**\ud83e\udde0 STRATEGY CALL:**  \nWe\u2019re **TIED** at 24-24. To win, we need to **survive while forcing the opponent to crash**.  \n- Opponent is in the top-left, but their body is long. They might try to move down to escape the corner.  \n- By moving **UP to (1,2)**, we:  \n  - Get closer to the opponent.  \n  - Potentially block their path down.  \n  - Position to eat an apple at (1,3) next turn if needed.  \n  - Keep multiple options: LEFT, UP, RIGHT from (1,2).  \n- If we move LEFT to (0,1), we\u2019re stuck against the wall. If the opponent moves right, we might not catch them.  \n\n**long-term plan:**  \nFrom (1,2), if opponent moves down, we can move UP to (1,3) or LEFT to (0,2) to cut them off. If they move right, we can chase them across the top. We need to stay agile and keep pressure on.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 FINAL DECISION:**  \nAggression wins. **UP** to (1,2) to close the distance and maintain options.  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",
