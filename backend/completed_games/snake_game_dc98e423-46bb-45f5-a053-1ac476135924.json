          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current board state and plan my move.\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (2,0) with no body. The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4,1) with no body.\n\nApples are at: (4,4), (6,7), (6,1), (3,8), (3,1)\n\nPossible moves from (2,0):\n- UP: (2,1)\n- DOWN: (2,-1) -> invalid (off board)\n- LEFT: (1,0)\n- RIGHT: (3,0)\n\nSo DOWN is immediately eliminated because it goes off the board.\n\nNow check if UP (2,1) is safe:\n- There are no snakes at (2,1) currently. The enemy is at (4,1) which is two cells away. But we must consider where the enemy might move this turn.\nEnemy snake at (4,1) can move: UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1).\n\nCheck LEFT (1,0):\n- Currently empty, but enemy might move here? Unlikely since enemy is at (4,1) and LEFT would be (3,1) or (4,0) etc.\n\nCheck RIGHT (3,0):\n- Currently empty.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious of head-on collisions. If I move RIGHT to (3,0) and the enemy moves LEFT to (3,1)? That doesn't cause collision. Or if enemy moves DOWN to (4,0)? That is adjacent but not same cell.\n\nActually, head-on collision only if we end up in same cell. So for UP (2,1): enemy would have to move to (2,1) from (4,1) which is impossible in one move (enemy can only go to adjacent). Similarly for LEFT (1,0) and RIGHT (3,0).\n\nSo all UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate suicide and from current board state.\n\nNow consider apples: the closest apples are at (3,1) and (6,1). (3,1) is very close: from (2,0), going UP to (2,1) then next move could go RIGHT to (3,1) to get the apple. Or from (3,0) (if I go RIGHT) then UP to (3,1).\n\nAlso (4,4) is above, but farther.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT lead towards apples.\n\nUP gets me to (2,1), which is adjacent to (3,1) and (2,2) etc.\nRIGHT gets me to (3,0), which is adjacent to (3,1) and (4,0) etc.\n\nWhich one gives more options?\nUP: from (2,1), possible moves: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1). All except DOWN (which is my tail? but I have no body yet, so DOWN is safe? Actually, after moving to (2,1), my tail is at (2,0) so DOWN would go to (2,0) which is my tail? But since I haven't eaten an apple, I haven't grown. So after moving to (2,1), my snake will have head at (2,1) and tail at (2,0). So if I then go DOWN to (2,0), I would hit my tail? Actually, rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". So if I go UP then next move DOWN, that would be directly backwards and kill me. So that is a risk.\n\nSimilarly, if I go RIGHT to (3,0), then my tail is at (2,0). So from (3,0), moving LEFT to (2,0) would be directly backwards and kill me.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT have the same issue: next move I cannot go backwards.\n\nBut for now, both are safe.\n\nTo avoid getting trapped, I should choose a move that gives more open options.\n\nAlso, consider enemy: enemy is at (4,1). It might go for the apple at (3,1) or (4,4) etc.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,1), I am closer to (3,1). If enemy goes LEFT to (3,1), then I can also go to (3,1) next turn? But that would cause head-on collision if we both go to (3,1) same turn. So I should avoid that.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,0), then I am not directly competing for (3,1) immediately.\n\nBut actually, (3,1) is an apple. Both snakes might target it.\n\nPerhaps I should go RIGHT to (3,0), then next turn go UP to (3,1) to get the apple. But enemy might also go to (3,1) from (4,1) by moving LEFT. So if enemy moves LEFT to (3,1) and I move UP to (3,1), we collide and both die.\n\nThat is bad.\n\nAlternatively, I could go UP to (2,1), and if enemy moves to (3,1), I can go elsewhere, like UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) only if safe.\n\nBut since we move simultaneously, I cannot know.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should not rush for the apple at (3,1) immediately because it might cause collision.\n\nInstead, I should go LEFT to (1,0). That is safe, and gives me space. From (1,0), I can go UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0) (but that is backwards? Actually, after moving to (1,0), my tail is at (2,0), so going RIGHT to (2,0) is backwards and kills me. So from (1,0), only UP and LEFT are safe? LEFT to (0,0) and UP to (1,1).\n\nSo that is two options.\n\nWhereas from UP (2,1): safe moves next turn: UP (2,2), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1) - but not DOWN.\nFrom RIGHT (3,0): safe moves next turn: UP (3,1), RIGHT (4,0) - not LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSo UP gives 3 safe follow-ups, RIGHT gives 2, LEFT gives 2.\n\nTherefore, UP is best for keeping options open.\n\nAlso, UP moves me towards the apple at (3,1) and also (4,4) long term.\n\nI think UP is the best choice.\n\nSo I'll go UP.\n\nRationale for next turn: Moved UP to (2,1). Now head at (2,1), tail at (2,0). Avoid moving backwards. Apple at (3,1) is close but be cautious of enemy at (4,1) possibly moving to (3,1). Consider going to (2,2) or (1,1) if enemy is threatening (3,1). Plan to collect apples safely without head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

It also moves me closer to the apple at (4,4) which is directly above.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to eat the apple at (3,1) and then aim upward toward the (4,4) apple while staying flexible.\n\nLEFT",

Actually, enemy head is at (3,1), so moving RIGHT would cause a head-on collision (both die).\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are eliminated. Only UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow check UP (2,2): \n- Is it on board? Yes.\n- Is it occupied? Currently empty.

Currently empty.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow consider apples: the closest apple is at (3,1) but it's adjacent to enemy head. Other apples: (4,4) is above, (6,1) is to the right but blocked by enemy, (3,8) is far up, (6,2) and (6,7).\n\nUP moves me towards (4,4) and (3,8).

Target apple at (4,4) by moving right and up. Be cautious of enemy #0 which might compete for apples. Consider going to (3,2) or (2,3) next turn.

Enemy body is at (3,1), so that would kill me).\n\nSo DOWN to (2,1) would lead to only two safe moves next turn (UP and LEFT) since RIGHT is enemy body.\n\nUP to (2,3) gives three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) assuming (3,3) is free.\nLEFT to (1,2) gives three safe moves (UP, LEFT, DOWN).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are good for future options.\n\nBut UP is better for approaching apples (4,4) and (3,8).

Avoid moving into enemy head if it goes to (3,3). Also, apple at (3,8) is far, so focus on (4,4) first. Be cautious of enemy #0 which has a body and might be aggressive.\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT would cause a head-on collision (both die). So RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow check other moves:\nUP (2,4): On board and currently empty.\nDOWN (2,2): On board and empty.\nLEFT (1,3): On board and empty.\n\nAll three moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe.\n\nNow consider apples: the closest apples are (4,4) above and (3,8) far above. Also (6,2) is to the right but blocked by enemy. Apple at (6,1) is below but near enemy body.\n\nUP moves me towards (4,4) and (3,8). DOWN moves me away from most apples. LEFT moves me away.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (3,3). It might move UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2) (its own body, so that would kill it), LEFT to (2,3) (my current head), or RIGHT to (4,3). So enemy cannot go DOWN (into its body) so it will choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), it would collide with my current head? But we are both moving simultaneously.

If I move DOWN to (2,2), enemy might move LEFT to (2,3) or elsewhere.\n\nNow, future options from each move:\n- From UP (2,4): can go UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4) (which might be occupied by enemy if it goes UP).\n- From LEFT (1,3): can go UP to (1,4), LEFT to (0,3), DOWN to (1,2).\n- From DOWN (2,2): can go UP to (2,3) (which might be occupied by enemy if it goes LEFT), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2) (enemy body, so dangerous).\n\nSo DOWN leads to a risky future because RIGHT is enemy body and UP might be occupied.

But we move simultaneously.\n\nImportant: If I move RIGHT to (4,5) and enemy also moves to (4,5) (which is its current position? No, enemy will move away or elsewhere), but actually enemy is at (4,5) now and will move to a new cell. So (4,5) will be empty after enemy moves? Not exactly: when snakes move, the head moves to a new cell, and the body follows. So at the start of the turn, enemy head is at (4,5). After enemy chooses a move, its head will go to a new cell (e.g., UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,5)). So (4,5) will become part of its body (since it has apples, the body grows when it moves? Actually, enemy has 2 apples, so its body length is 2 segments plus head. When it moves without eating an apple, the tail moves forward so the body remains same length. So after enemy moves, the cell (4,5) might become body? Actually, the body segments shift: the head moves to new position, the first body segment becomes the old head position (4,5), and the tail moves forward (so the last body segment is lost if no apple eaten). But since enemy has 2 apples, its body length is 3 (head + 2 segments). So after moving without eating, the head goes to new cell, the first body segment becomes (4,5), the second becomes (4,4), and the tail (3,4) is lost? Actually, the body list is: head, then body segments. So after moving, the new body will be [new head, old head, old body without tail]. So if enemy moves without eating, the new body will be [new_head, (4,5), (4,4)] and the tail (3,4) is freed.\n\nTherefore, after enemy moves, (4,5) will become a body segment of enemy. So if I move RIGHT to (4,5), I would be moving into enemy body (which is deadly) because after the move, (4,5) is enemy body.\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT to (3,5), that would be my current head position, but I will move away. So (3,5) will be free after I move.\n\nSo for me:\n- DOWN: (3,4) is enemy body (currently (3,4) is enemy body, and after move it might still be body? Actually, enemy might move and the body shifts, but (3,4) might remain body? Since enemy has 2 apples, its body length is constant. So (3,4) is currently body and will remain body after move (unless enemy eats an apple and grows, but that doesn't happen instantly). So (3,4) is always dangerous.\n- RIGHT: (4,5) will become enemy body after enemy moves (since enemy head leaves (4,5) and it becomes a body segment). So moving RIGHT is into enemy body -> deadly.\n- UP: (3,6) is free.\n- LEFT: (2,5) is free.\n\nSo only UP and LEFT are safe moves.\n\nNow, apples: closest is (3,8) which is up. Also (6,7) is right and up. (6,1) and (6,2) are right and down, but down is blocked. (7,0) is far right and down.\n\nSo UP moves me towards (3,8). LEFT moves me away from apples.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best choice.\n\nEnemy possible moves: from (4,5), it can go UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4) (which is its own body? Currently (4,4) is its body, so dangerous), LEFT (3,5) (which is my head, but I will move away), RIGHT (5,5). So enemy will avoid DOWN (into own body). So enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,5), but I am moving to UP (3,6), so no collision.\n\nSo UP is safe and beneficial.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (3,6), next turn plan to go UP to (3,7) to approach apple at (3,8). Be cautious of enemy movements.\n\nUP",

Apples are at (6,7), (6,1), (3,8), (6,2), (7,0).\n\nPossible moves from (3,6):\n- UP: (3,7) -> empty (from board state)\n- DOWN: (3,5) -> empty (but note: last turn I was at (3,6) and moved UP from (3,5)? Actually, last turn head was at (3,5) and I moved UP to (3,6). So now (3,5) is free? But enemy body is at (4,5) and (4,4), so (3,5) is safe.\n- LEFT: (2,6) -> empty\n- RIGHT: (4,6) -> enemy head (snake #0 is currently at (4,6)) -> dangerous: if I move RIGHT, I go to (4,6) which is enemy head. But we move simultaneously. After enemy moves, (4,6) might become enemy body? However, head-on collision rules: if both heads move to same cell, both die. Also, if I move into enemy head's new position? Actually, enemy is at (4,6) and will move to a new cell. So if I move RIGHT to (4,6), that cell will be empty after enemy moves? Not exactly: enemy head leaves (4,6) and it becomes part of its body (since it has apples, body grows? Actually, enemy has 2 apples so body length is 3 including head. When it moves without eating, the tail is lost. So after enemy moves, (4,6) becomes a body segment. Therefore, moving RIGHT to (4,6) would be moving into enemy body (deadly) because after the move, (4,6) is enemy body.\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nNow, DOWN: (3,5) is free. But is it safe? Enemy body is at (4,5) and (4,4), so (3,5) is not adjacent to enemy body. Also, enemy head is at (4,6) and might move to (3,6)? But I am leaving (3,6). So DOWN seems safe.\n\nLEFT: (2,6) is free and safe.\n\nUP: (3,7) is free and safe.\n\nSo all except RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, apples: closest is (3,8) which is up. Also (6,7) is right and up. (6,1) and (6,2) are right and down, but right is blocked. (7,0) is far.\n\nSo UP moves directly towards (3,8). DOWN moves away from apples. LEFT moves away.\n\nTherefore, UP is best.\n\nEnemy possible moves: from (4,6), it can go UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5) (which is its own body -> dangerous), LEFT (3,6) (which is my current head, but I am moving UP to (3,7)), RIGHT (5,6). So enemy will avoid DOWN. So it can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,6), that is safe for me since I am moving to (3,7). No collision.\n\nSo UP is safe and beneficial.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (3,7), next turn plan to go UP to (3,8) to eat the apple. Be cautious of enemy movements - enemy might also go for (3,8) or (4,7) etc. But since enemy is at (4,6), it can reach (3,8) in two moves (e.g., LEFT to (3,6) then UP to (3,7) and then UP to (3,8)? Actually, from (4,6) to (3,8) is not direct. Enemy might go UP to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7) and then UP to (3,8). So we might compete for (3,8). But I am closer: I am at (3,6) and will be at (3,7) after this move, so next turn I can go to (3,8). Enemy would need two moves to get to (3,8) (e.g., LEFT to (3,6) then UP to (3,7) and then next turn UP to (3,8)). So I have priority.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nUP",

This is safe because (3,8) is not occupied by any snake currently.\n- DOWN: (3,6) -> empty (from board state, no snake there). But note: last turn I moved from (3,6) to (3,7) (UP). So (3,6) is free.\n- LEFT: (2,7) -> empty.\n- RIGHT: (4,7) -> enemy head (snake #0 is currently at (4,7)). This is dangerous: if I move RIGHT, I go to (4,7) which is enemy head.

DOWN is unsafe.\n\nNow, consider apples: The closest apple is (6,7) which is to the right and down. But note: (6,7) is adjacent to enemy head (5,7). Enemy snake #0 might be targeting that apple. Other apples are farther: (6,1) and (6,2) are far down, (7,0) bottom right, (7,9) top right.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,7) has possible moves:\n- UP: (5,8) -> empty\n- DOWN: (5,6) -> empty (but note: its body is at (4,6) and (4,7), so (5,6) is free)\n- LEFT: (4,7) -> its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (6,7) -> apple (6,7) is there. If enemy moves RIGHT, it eats the apple and grows.\n\nSo enemy will likely avoid LEFT (into body). It might go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,8), I am one step closer to (6,7) but enemy is at (5,7) and might also move to (6,7). This could lead to a head-on collision if we both go to (6,7) next turn? But not this turn.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (4,8) is safe this turn. But next turn, from (4,8), I could go RIGHT to (5,8) or DOWN to (4,7) (which might be enemy body? Actually, enemy body is at (4,7) currently, but after enemy moves, (4,7) will remain as body? Since enemy has 2 apples, its body length is 3. When it moves without eating, the tail (4,6) is lost and (4,7) becomes part of the body. So if enemy moves away, (4,7) will be body. So (4,7) will be dangerous next turn.\n\nAlternatively, I can move UP to (3,9) which is safe and gives me more space. Or LEFT to (2,8) which is also safe.\n\nLong-term: I need to collect apples while avoiding enemy. The enemy has 2 apples and is larger. I should avoid direct confrontation until I grow.\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n- Avoid moving too close to enemy head (5,7). Instead, consider going for the apples at (6,1) or (6,2) which are farther but safer? Or (7,9) which is top right.\n- From (3,8), moving UP to (3,9) is good to get to the top row. Then I can go right towards (7,9) or left.\n- Moving LEFT to (2,8) is also safe and opens left side.\n\nBut note: there is an apple at (6,7) which is tempting but risky due to enemy proximity.\n\nGiven that enemy might go for (6,7), I should avoid that area for now. Instead, I should go UP to (3,9) to get away and then plan to go right along the top to (7,9) apple.\n\nSo UP is a good move to get to the top edge.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nUP",

UP and DOWN are unsafe.\n\nNow, consider apples: The closest apple is (7,9) at top right. From (3,9), moving RIGHT would get me closer to (7,9) (distance: 4 steps right). Moving LEFT would take me away from it.\nAnother apple is (1,6) which is to the left and down, but moving LEFT to (2,9) doesn't directly help; I'd need to go down later.\nOther apples are far: (6,1), (6,2), (7,0) are at bottom right.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,7) has possible moves:\n- UP: (6,8) -> empty\n- DOWN: (6,6) -> empty\n- LEFT: (5,7) -> its own body (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (7,7) -> empty\n\nSo enemy will avoid LEFT. It might go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Note that there is an apple at (7,9) which is two steps away (right then up) and one at (6,2) which is far. Enemy might not be targeting (7,9) immediately.\n\nHowever, since enemy has 3 apples (longer body) and is at (6,7), it might be more aggressive. I should avoid getting too close to it.\n\nFrom my position, moving RIGHT to (4,9) is directly towards (7,9). This is promising. Moving LEFT to (2,9) is safe but not directly beneficial for apples.\n\nAlso, note that the board has an apple at (1,6) which is in the left region. If I go LEFT to (2,9), I can then plan to go down towards (1,6). But that requires multiple moves and might risk encountering the enemy later.\n\nGiven that (7,9) is only 4 steps away and there are no obstacles directly in the path (except possibly the enemy, but enemy is at y=7 and I'm at y=9, so I have a buffer), moving RIGHT seems better.\n\nLong-term plan: Move right along the top row to collect (7,9). Then consider going down for other apples or avoiding enemy. Since enemy is at y=7, staying at top row (y=9) is relatively safe for now.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

However, it moves me away from the immediate apple at (7,9).\n\nLong-term: I should aim for (7,9) since it's close. But I need to be cautious of the enemy. Since enemy is at (7,7), it can reach (7,9) in two moves (e.g., UP to (7,8) then UP to (7,9)) while I need two moves RIGHT to (5,9) then (6,9), and then (7,9) in three moves.

This avoids direct competition with the enemy.\n\nGiven that enemy has 3 apples (longer body) and is more aggressive, I should avoid head-on collisions.

From (4,8), moving RIGHT gets me closer (distance reduces to 3 steps: (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), then (7,9)). However, enemy snake #0 is at (7,8) and might also target (7,9). Moving RIGHT might lead to a head-on collision risk.\n- Apple at (1,6) is left and down. Moving LEFT or DOWN helps.\n- Apples at (6,1), (6,2), (7,0) are far and require going down.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (7,8) has possible moves:\n- UP: (7,9) -> apple!

Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,5) -> empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) -> empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is unsafe. DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- (1,2) is directly below me: DOWN to (1,4), then DOWN to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2) - 3 moves away.\n- (0,4) is to the left and down: LEFT to (0,5), then DOWN to (0,4) - 2 moves away.\n- (6,1), (6,2), (7,0) are far away and near the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,6) -> its own body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (6,4) -> empty\n- LEFT: (5,5) -> empty\n- RIGHT: (7,5) -> empty\n\nThe enemy is not an immediate threat. It might be heading towards the apples at (6,1) or (6,2).\n\nI should prioritize getting closer to the nearest apples: (1,2) and (0,4). Moving DOWN gets me closer to (1,2), moving LEFT gets me closer to (0,4). Both are good options.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (1,4), next moves: UP (to (1,5) - unsafe, my body), DOWN to (1,3) (empty), LEFT to (0,4) (empty), RIGHT to (2,4) (empty). So three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n- If I go LEFT to (0,5), next moves: UP to (0,6) (empty), DOWN to (0,4) (empty), RIGHT to (1,5) (unsafe, my body). So two safe moves (UP and DOWN).\n- If I go RIGHT to (2,5), next moves: UP to (2,6) (empty), DOWN to (2,4) (empty), LEFT to (1,5) (unsafe). So two safe moves (UP and DOWN).\n\nDOWN gives me more options (3 safe moves) than LEFT or RIGHT (2 each). Also, DOWN leads directly towards the apple at (1,2). However, LEFT gets me to (0,5) which is adjacent to (0,4) - the apple is very close.\n\nGiven that (0,4) is only 2 moves away via LEFT+DOWN, and (1,2) is 3 moves away via DOWN+DOWN+DOWN, I should consider LEFT to position myself for (0,4). Also, (0,5) is safe and from there I can go DOWN to (0,4) to eat the apple next turn.\n\nBut note: if I go LEFT to (0,5), I have two safe moves next turn (UP and DOWN). Going DOWN to (0,4) would eat the apple. This is efficient.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I can then go LEFT to (0,4) to eat the apple in two moves as well? Actually: from (1,4), LEFT to (0,4) is one move to the apple. So both DOWN and LEFT lead to the apple in two moves? Wait:\n\n- If I go LEFT now to (0,5), then next turn DOWN to (0,4) -> eats apple.\n- If I go DOWN now to (1,4), then next turn LEFT to (0,4) -> eats apple.\n\nSo both are equally efficient for reaching (0,4). However, going LEFT now puts me at (0,5), which has only two safe moves (UP and DOWN). Going DOWN now puts me at (1,4), which has three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). So DOWN gives more flexibility.\n\nAlso, from (1,4) I can also go DOWN to (1,3) to get closer to (1,2) if I want. So DOWN is better for options.\n\nMoreover, the enemy is far away and not a threat.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN to maintain flexibility and move towards both apples (0,4) and (1,2).\n\nPlan for next turns: From (1,4), I can go LEFT to (0,4) to eat the apple, or continue DOWN to (1,3) to approach (1,2).

Alternatively, if I go DOWN now, I can be at (0,3) and then next turn I can go RIGHT to (1,3) and then DOWN to (1,2) to eat it.\n- Other apples are farther: (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,6) are all distant and require crossing the board. Enemy snake #0 is near those apples (at (6,3)) and might be competing for them.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,3) has possible moves:\n- UP: (6,4) -> its own body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (6,2) -> apple at (6,2) (safe and beneficial)\n- LEFT: (5,3) -> empty\n- RIGHT: (7,3) -> empty\n\nSo the enemy is likely to go DOWN to eat the apple at (6,2) or possibly LEFT/RIGHT to avoid danger.

Actually, my body will be at [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] (since I didn't eat an apple this turn, so no growth). So (0,4) is my body? Wait, my head moves to (0,3), so the body becomes [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]? Actually, the body follows: the head moves to (0,3), and the tail moves? Since no apple eaten, the tail moves: the last segment (1,6) is dropped. So the new body is [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5)]? Let me clarify:\n\nCurrent head: (0,4)\nBody: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\nAfter moving DOWN to (0,3):\nNew head: (0,3)\nNew body: [ (0,4), (1,4), (1,5) ]  (the tail (1,6) is dropped because no apple eaten)\n\nSo from (0,3), the safe moves:\n- UP: (0,4) -> my body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (0,2) -> empty\n- LEFT: (-1,3) -> off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,3) -> empty\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. I want to go to (1,2), so RIGHT to (1,3) is better. Then from (1,3), I can go DOWN to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\nSo this plan is good: move DOWN now to (0,3), then next turn RIGHT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2).\n\nEnemy is not a direct threat to me at this point.\n\nSo move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

I have collected 3 apples.\nApples are at: (6,1), (7,0), (1,2), (7,6), (2,5)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (6,2) and body [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)] with 5 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (0,3):\n- UP: (0,4) -> my own body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (0,2) -> empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (-1,3) -> off the board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,3) -> empty (safe)\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- Apple at (1,2) is very close: from (0,3), going DOWN to (0,2) and then RIGHT to (1,2) would take 2 moves. Alternatively, going RIGHT to (1,3) and then DOWN to (1,2) also takes 2 moves.\n- Apple at (2,5) is also reachable but farther.\n- Other apples are distant and near the enemy.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (6,2) has possible moves:\n- UP: (6,3) -> its own body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (6,1) -> apple at (6,1) (safe and beneficial)\n- LEFT: (5,2) -> empty\n- RIGHT: (7,2) -> empty\n\nSo the enemy is likely to go DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid danger.\n\nMy immediate goal is to eat the nearest apple at (1,2). To do that efficiently:\n- If I go DOWN to (0,2), next turn I can go RIGHT to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n- If I go RIGHT to (1,3), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient. However, going RIGHT to (1,3) might be slightly better because:\n- It avoids moving towards the bottom edge (which has fewer options) and keeps me more central.\n- From (1,3), after eating the apple at (1,2), I can consider moving towards (2,5) or other areas.\n\nAlso, note that going DOWN to (0,2) leaves me with only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (1,2)), whereas going RIGHT to (1,3) gives me more options: DOWN to (1,2) or UP to (1,4) (which might be safe if my body moves away) or RIGHT to (2,3). Actually, after moving to (1,3), my body will be [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4)] (since no apple eaten this turn, the tail (1,5) is dropped). So from (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) -> my body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (1,2) -> empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (0,3) -> my body? Actually, (0,3) is now part of my body (the first segment) so unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) -> empty (safe)\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe from (1,3). Similarly, from (0,2) after moving DOWN:\n- UP: (0,3) -> my body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (0,1) -> empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (-1,2) -> off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,2) -> empty (safe)\n\nSo both positions give two safe moves. However, (1,3) is more central and closer to other apples like (2,5).\n\nTherefore, I should go RIGHT to (1,3) now, then next turn DOWN to (1,2) to eat the apple.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3) this turn.\n- Next turn, move DOWN to (1,2) to eat the apple (growing to 5 segments).\n- After that, consider moving towards (2,5) or other safe directions.\n\nEnemy is not a threat to me at this distance.\n\nSo move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

I have 5 apples.\nApples are at: (7,6), (5,9), (5,3), (7,8), (8,9)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (8,2) and body: [(8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (7,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] with 8 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (2,5):\n- UP: (2,6) -> empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (2,4) -> my own body (unsafe) - this is the segment directly behind my head.\n- LEFT: (1,5) -> empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (3,5) -> empty (safe)\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider the apples: the closest ones are (5,3) and (5,9). (5,3) is at y=3, which is below me (y=5), and (5,9) is above (y=9). To get to (5,3), I need to go left and down, but down is blocked by my body. So I cannot go directly down. Instead, I can go left to (1,5) and then down to (1,4) etc., but that might be longer. Alternatively, I can go right to (3,5) and then further right to approach (5,3) via (4,5) and (5,5) then down to (5,4) and (5,3). Similarly, for (5,9), I need to go up and right.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy snake #0 is at (8,2) with 8 apples. It is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nNow, let's evaluate safe moves:\n- UP (2,6): This moves me away from (5,3) but towards (5,9). However, (5,9) is far. From (2,6), I can go UP to (2,7), LEFT to (1,6), or RIGHT to (3,6). This gives options.\n- LEFT (1,5): This moves me left. From here, I can go UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4) (which is safe? Check: (1,4) is currently empty in the board state), or RIGHT to (2,5) but that is my head's previous position? Actually, after moving, my head will be at (1,5), and my body will be [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] (since I didn't eat an apple, so the tail moves). So (1,4) is empty. So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (0,5) is also safe (within board).\n- RIGHT (3,5): This moves me right towards the center. From (3,5), I can go UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4) (empty), LEFT to (2,5) (but that is my body? Actually, after moving, my head is at (3,5), and the body includes (2,5) so LEFT is unsafe), RIGHT to (4,5) (empty). So from (3,5), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is unsafe.\n\nSo RIGHT gives me UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe next turn.\n\nNow, to plan for apples: (5,3) is at (5,3). To reach it, I need to go right and down. Starting from (2,5), going RIGHT to (3,5) is a step in that direction. Then I can go to (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3). This seems efficient.\n\nSimilarly, if I go LEFT to (1,5), I would have to go down to (1,4), (1,3) but (1,3) is my tail? Actually, after moving, my tail will be at (1,2) (since the tail moves forward), so (1,3) becomes free? But wait: my body is [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)] and head at (2,5). After moving LEFT to (1,5), the new body becomes [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)] and tail at (1,2). So (1,3) is free. So from (1,5), I can go DOWN to (1,4) (free), then to (1,3) (free), then to (1,2) but that is my body? Actually, (1,2) is the tail, which will move next turn. So it's safe. But this path is longer to (5,3).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is better for approaching (5,3).\n\nAlso, RIGHT gives me more open space: the right side has fewer obstacles.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is on the right, but at (8,2), which is far. It might move towards the apples at (7,8) or (8,9), so it will go up, not towards me.\n\nSo I should go RIGHT to (3,5) to start moving towards the apple at (5,3).\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT to (3,5) this turn.\n- Next turn, from (3,5), I can go RIGHT to (4,5) (preferred to get closer to (5,3)), or UP to (3,6), or DOWN to (3,4). Avoid LEFT to (2,5) as it is my body.\n- Then continue to (5,5) and down to (5,4) and (5,3) to eat the apple.\n- Also, keep an eye on enemy #0; it is large but far.\n\nRIGHT",

It might move towards apples at (7,6) or (7,8) \u2014 likely going UP. No immediate collision threat. But if I go DOWN toward (5,3), I must watch for enemy going to (7,4) etc. The proximity risk is not significant this turn.\n\n**Future safety check after each move:**  \n\n**RIGHT (5,5)** \u2192 Next turn safe moves: likely UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5) \u2014 but (4,5) will be occupied by my body segment next turn, so not safe. Actually wait: after I move to (5,5), my body becomes: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] because we move head forward and shift body. Body segments shorten only if no apple eaten. So body occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). Tail is (2,3). So from (5,5), LEFT to (4,5) is unsafe (body). So from (5,5), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good options still.\n\n**UP (4,6)** \u2192 Moves away from nearest apple, but might target (5,9) long-term. From (4,6), next turn could go UP (4,7), RIGHT (5,6), or LEFT (3,6). All probably safe next turn, but less direct toward apples.\n\n**DOWN (4,4)** \u2192 Moves toward (5,3). From (4,4), next turn: DOWN (4,3), RIGHT (5,4), LEFT (3,4). Check body: after moving to (4,4), body: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] \u2192 tail at (2,3). So (3,4) is empty. So safe next moves: DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT. Three options.  \n\nDOWN seems slightly riskier if enemy #0 goes to (6,3) then (5,3), but not immediate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is most direct toward apple (5,3) and keeps 2+ safe moves next turn. DOWN is also good but less direct (need two moves to get to x=5). RIGHT is optimal.\n\nPlan for next turns:  \nAfter RIGHT to (5,5), choose DOWN to (5,4) next turn to approach (5,3), unless enemy blocks \u2014 then maybe RIGHT to (6,5) for safety.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 has more apples and is likely heading to (7,8), so I should focus on the left side apples first to avoid direct competition.\n\nLEFT seems optimal as it moves me toward (3,9) while keeping me away from the enemy snake's territory. This also gives me good future options to move up or continue left.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (4,1) moves me closer to the apple at (5,1) and maintains better positioning.\n\nRIGHT seems optimal because:\n1. It progresses directly toward the apple at (5,1)\n2.

The apple at (6,0) is directly below me and represents an easy, safe score.\n\nDOWN is optimal because:\n1. It immediately secures the apple at (6,0)\n2. It grows my snake to 9 segments (9 apples vs enemy's 14)\n3. The enemy is far away and poses no threat\n4. After eating, I'll be well-positioned to move toward other apples like (8,4), (9,2), or (9,5)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating the (6,0) apple, consider moving RIGHT toward (8,4) or UP/RIGHT toward (9,2) and (9,5). The apple at (1,0) is also available but requires careful navigation through the bottom-left area. Continue collecting apples while maintaining safe movement options.

Moving LEFT moves me away from apples and into more confined space.\n\nRIGHT is preferable because:\n1.

Avoids moving left into the crowded left side where my body is concentrated\n4. The enemy is still at (5,6) and likely moving upward/downward, giving me time to secure (8,4)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (8,3) this turn, then UP to (8,4) next turn to collect the apple. After securing (8,4), target the top-right apples (9,5) and (9,2). Monitor enemy movement - it may be heading toward the same apples.

Its long body extends downward but doesn't pose immediate threat. However, it might move toward the apples at (4, 4) or (2, 4).\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nTaking the apple at (3, 0) with LEFT gives me immediate growth and keeps me on the safer bottom row. Going UP would take me away from this easy apple and toward potential conflict with the enemy snake for the upper apples.\n\nThe bottom row appears safer since the enemy is far away and I have more room to maneuver. After eating (3, 0), I can proceed to (1, 0) for another easy apple.\n\n**DANGER POTENTIAL:**\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe this turn. UP might lead to potential future encounters with the enemy. LEFT continues my current strategy of clearing the bottom row apples.\n\nLEFT is the clear choice to secure immediate apple collection while maintaining safety.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN:**\nAfter LEFT to (3, 0) to eat the apple, continue LEFT toward (1, 0) if safe. Then consider moving upward to target remaining apples, but be mindful of the enemy snake's position and potential traps.\n\nLEFT",

Let's check from diagram: row 1, col 2 is empty (no symbol on board). Safe.  \n- DOWN: (2, -1) \u2013 off board \u2192 not safe.  \n- LEFT: (1, 0) \u2013 apple there (A), also empty otherwise (except if snake #0 moves there \u2013 but unlikely as it's far away). Safe.  \n- RIGHT: (3, 0) \u2013 my own body (segment from last turn\u2019s body list: (3, 0) is 2nd segment of my snake). Not safe.\n\nPossible safe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Goals & Strategy**  \n1) Immediate apple at (1, 0) \u2013 moving LEFT eats it and grows. Enemy is far (head at (3, 8)).  \n2) Long-term \u2013 after eating bottom apples, perhaps work upwards toward (1, 5) to gather more without colliding with enemy snake #0, who is near apples (4, 4), (5, 4).  \n\nEnemy snake #0 body blocks top half of board but not an immediate threat to apples at (1, 0) or (2, 4) from my position after eating (1, 0).  \n\n**Risk of LEFT:**  \n- Eating apple \u2192 new body segment appears at tail next turn, so current tail stays another turn before dropping off.  \n- Would put me at (1, 0), giving possible next moves UP to (1, 1) or RIGHT back to (2, 0) \u2014 but careful: (2, 0) will become empty after this move (tail follows), though not useful to backtrack. UP from (1, 0) next turn leads to path toward (1, 5).\n\n**Risk of UP:**  \n- No apple, but goes toward middle board \u2014 but entering from (2, 1) could allow later accessing (2, 4) apple after a few moves. But this misses the immediate safe apple at (1, 0) without clear gain in safety.\n\nLEFT seems directly profitable and safe; UP delays eating that apple, potentially letting enemy take apples later if they come down.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 0), try UP to (1, 1) if safe, then toward (1, 5) apple unless enemy blocks path. Keep along left/top edges to avoid getting trapped near enemy; enemy snake long body limits its mobility but watch for it descending.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current board state and plan the next move.\n\n**Current Position & Safe Moves:**\nMy snake head is at (1, 0) after last turn's LEFT move (which ate the apple at (1, 0)). Now my body has grown: the tail remains at (8,5) for this turn (since we just ate an apple, the tail doesn't move this turn). So the body is now: head (1,0), then (2,0), (3,0), ... up to (8,5) (14 segments? Actually, we had 14 apples before, so body length should be 15 segments including head? But the list provided has 14 segments including head? Wait, the initial body list had 14 segments (head + 13 body parts) and we just ate an apple, so now we have 15 segments. But the board state diagram might not reflect the new tail yet? Actually, the board state is given after the last move? The board state shown is for turn 63, and we just moved to (1,0) and ate the apple. So the tail hasn't dropped yet? Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow immediately, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So the body should be longer now.\n\nBut looking at the board state diagram provided for turn 63:\nRow 0: \". 1 T T T T T T T .\" meaning at (1,0) is head \"1\", and (2,0) to (8,0) are body \"T\", and (8,1) to (8,5) are also body? So indeed the tail is at (8,5) still.\n\nNow for next move (turn 64), my head is at (1,0). Adjacent cells:\n- UP: (1,1) - from board diagram: row 1, col 1 is empty (no symbol). Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,-1) - off board. Not safe.\n- LEFT: (0,0) - off board? Actually, x=0 is valid, but board shows at (0,0) there is \".\" meaning empty. But wait, coordinate (0,0) is bottom left. So it is on board. But is it safe? Check: no snake body there? Board shows \".\" at (0,0). So safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,0) - my own body (second segment). Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n**Apples and Strategy:**\nApples available: (2,4), (4,4), (5,4), (1,5), (9,1). The closest is (1,5) at top left? Actually, (1,5) is at x=1, y=5. So from (1,0), moving UP directly leads toward it.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (3,7) with long body. It might be heading for apples at (4,4) or (5,4)? But it's far from (1,5).\n\nSo moving UP from (1,0) to (1,1) is a step toward (1,5). Also, moving LEFT to (0,0) is safe but doesn't progress toward apples as directly? However, (0,0) might be a dead end? But we can go up from there later.\n\nBut note: if I go LEFT to (0,0), next turn I can only go UP (to (0,1)) since DOWN is off and RIGHT is body? So only one option. Whereas if I go UP to (1,1), I have more options: next turn can go UP to (1,2), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1) (which might be safe? Check board: (2,1) is empty? Row 1, col 2 is \".\").\n\nSo UP gives more future flexibility.\n\nAlso, going UP avoids trapping myself in the corner at (0,0). Although it's safe for now, it limits options.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision?**\nEnemy head is at (3,7). It might move in any direction. But it's far away (6 steps horizontally and 7 vertically). So no immediate threat.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (1,1) to start ascending toward the apple at (1,5). This keeps options open and progresses toward an apple.\n\nNext turn, from (1,1), I can consider UP to (1,2), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1). I should avoid moving too far right toward enemy, but (2,1) is safe for now.\n\nLong-term: aim for (1,5) apple, then perhaps (2,4) if still available. Avoid enemy which is likely going for (4,4) and (5,4).\n\nUP",

Eating an apple is safe.\n- DOWN (1,3): My own body. **NOT SAFE.**\n- LEFT (0,4): Empty '.' **SAFE.**\n- RIGHT (2,4): Enemy snake #0's head. **RISK OF HEAD-ON COLLISION. NOT SAFE.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **UP (1,5)**: Eats the apple at (1,5). This is highly desirable. After eating, my body will grow, but the new head position is safe as it's currently an apple. I need to consider the enemy's possible moves from (2,4). The enemy could move UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4 - my current head, collision only if I stay, which I'm not), or RIGHT (3,4 - its own body, unsafe for it). A head-on collision would only occur if we both choose the same cell. Moving to (1,5) is not a cell the enemy can reach in one move from (2,4). This move is safe and beneficial.\n- **LEFT (0,4)**: Moves away from the enemy and the apples. This area is less crowded but also less rewarding. It avoids immediate conflict but doesn't progress my score.\n\n**Long-term consideration:** The enemy snake is longer (17 apples vs my 14). Engaging in a head-on collision is suicidal. My primary goal is to collect apples safely. The apple at (1,5) is the closest and most easily obtainable. Securing it should be the priority. After this, the board will be more open, and I can reassess the path to the other apples (4,4), (5,4), (3,3), and (9,1). Moving LEFT seems overly cautious and gives up a clear opportunity.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating the apple at (1,5), my head will be there. I should look to move towards the cluster of apples at (3,3), (4,4), and (5,4), but must be very aware of the enemy snake's position and potential moves to avoid collision. The right side of the board is heavily occupied by the enemy's body, so careful pathfinding will be needed.\n\nUP",

This area has fewer apples currently (only (9,1) is somewhat close, but far). It might lead to a dead-end if I go too far up.\n- LEFT (1,6): Moves me towards the left side where there is an apple at (0,2). This is a promising direction for scoring. However, I must be cautious of my own long body which occupies many cells on the bottom left.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nThe enemy head is at (4,3). It has several options: it might move towards the apple at (4,4) or (5,4) (RIGHT or UP), or perhaps towards (7,3) (RIGHT). It is unlikely to move LEFT into its own body. My move LEFT to (1,6) is far from the enemy and should be safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should prioritize getting the apple at (0,2) since it is the closest and most accessible. Moving LEFT now is a step in that direction. I need to plan a path down the left side, avoiding my own body which is mostly below me. My body currently blocks direct downward moves, so I may need to go left and then down carefully. The enemy is scoring faster (18 vs my 15), so I need to catch up. The apples at (4,4) and (5,4) are risky due to enemy proximity, and (7,3) is also near the enemy. (9,1) is far and not efficient. Therefore, targeting (0,2) is my best bet.\n\nLEFT is the move that aligns with this goal and is safe.\n\nLEFT",

It does not collect an apple (the apple at (9,1) is far away). My tail will move forward one segment, so my new tail end will be at (5,0)? Actually, since I grew last turn, my tail doesn't move this turn? Wait, let's clarify: I collected an apple last turn (turn 76), so my snake grew. This means that on this turn (turn 77), when I move, my tail will *not* advance (because I grew last turn). So my body length remains the same.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy head is at (7,2). It can move UP to (7,3) (its own body), DOWN to (7,1) (empty), LEFT to (6,2) (empty), or RIGHT to (8,2) (empty). None of these moves threaten me at (0,2) or (0,1). The enemy is far away.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI am currently trapped against the left wall. My only escape is to move DOWN to (0,1). From there, my next move must be to the RIGHT to (1,1) (which is currently my body segment #11, but that segment will move away when my tail advances? Actually, careful: my body segments move only when I move without eating an apple. Since I did not eat an apple this turn, my tail will advance next turn? Let's trace:\n\nCurrent body: head at (0,2), then segments: (0,3), (0,4), ... (5,0). When I move to (0,1), the head moves to (0,1), and each body segment shifts forward. So the segment that was at (0,3) moves to (0,2), and the tail (at (5,0)) moves away? Actually, the tail moves to the next segment: the segment that was at (4,0) becomes the new tail? So after moving DOWN, my new body will be: head (0,1), then (0,2), (0,3), ... (4,0). So (1,1) will be free next turn? Because the current segment at (1,1) is the 11th segment, which will shift to (1,2) when I move down. So indeed, (1,1) becomes empty.\n\nTherefore, after moving DOWN to (0,1), I can then move RIGHT to (1,1) next turn. That will get me off the left wall and open up more options. From (1,1), I can consider moving towards the apple at (6,1) or other areas.\n\n**Decision:**\nOnly one safe move: DOWN to (0,1).

It does not collect an apple (the apple at (9,1) is far away). Since I did not eat an apple last turn (turn 77), my tail will advance this turn. So my new tail end will be at (3,0) (the segment that was at (4,0) becomes the tail? Actually, careful: my body length is 17 segments. When I move without eating, the tail moves. So after moving DOWN, my new body will be: head (0,0), then (0,1), (0,2), ... (3,0). So (1,0) will be free next turn? Because the current segment at (1,0) is segment #13, which will shift to (1,1) when I move down.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy head is at (6,2). It can move UP to (6,3) (empty), DOWN to (6,1) (empty, and there's an apple), LEFT to (5,2) (empty), or RIGHT to (7,2) (its own body). The enemy might move towards the apple at (6,1). It is not a direct threat to me at (0,1) or (0,0).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI am currently trapped against the left wall and bottom edge. My only escape is to move DOWN to (0,0). From there, my next move must be to the RIGHT to (1,0) (which will be empty next turn, as explained above). That will get me off the left wall and open up more options. From (1,0), I can consider moving towards the apple at (6,1) or other areas. However, note that the enemy might also be heading for (6,1). I need to be cautious.\n\n**Decision:**\nOnly one safe move: DOWN to (0,0). This is necessary to escape the trap.\n\nDOWN\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

The tail (3,0) is gone. So (1,0) is now occupied by my body (segment #14). Therefore, RIGHT (1,0) is **NOT SAFE**.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are unsafe? But that can't be right because I just moved to (0,0) and should have a way out. Actually, the only adjacent cell that is on the board is UP (0,1) and RIGHT (1,0). Both are occupied by my body. So I am trapped? But wait, I must have made a mistake.\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . T T . . . . A\n 8 . . . T T T T T . A\n 7 . . . T . . A . . .\n 6 T T T T . . . . A .\n 5 T T T T . . . . . .\n 4 T T T T T T T T . .\n 3 T T T T T . . T . .\n 2 T T . . . . T T . .\n 1 T T . . . . 0 . . A\n 0 1 T T T . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nAt (0,0): it says \"1\" (my head)\nAt (1,0): it says \"T\" (my body)\nSo indeed, (1,0) is occupied by my body. And (0,1) is also \"T\" (my body). So I am completely surrounded by my own body and the edge. There is no safe move? But that would mean I die this turn. However, the rules say that moving backwards into your own body kills you. So if I try to move UP to (0,1), I die. Similarly, RIGHT to (1,0) dies. DOWN and LEFT are off the board.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that (1,0) becomes free next turn? No, because the tail advanced last turn. So (1,0) is now a permanent part of my body.\n\nThis is a critical situation. I must have made a bad move last turn. Now I have no safe moves. However, the game hasn't ended yet, so I must choose a move. The least bad might be to move RIGHT into my own body, but that kills me. Or off the board.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the board. The board shows at (0,0): \"1\", and at (1,0): \"T\". So it is occupied.\n\nWait, is there a chance that the board representation is not updated? The board state is given for turn 78, and I just moved to (0,0). So it should be accurate.\n\nThis is a dead end. I have no safe moves. Therefore, I must choose a move that will kill me. But perhaps I can hope for the enemy to die first? However, that is unlikely.\n\nGiven that I have no escape, I will choose RIGHT to (1,0) to die quickly.\n\nBut let's double-check the coordinates: my head is at (0,0). The cell to the right is (1,0). According to the board, that is \"T\", which is my body. So it is unsafe.\n\nSo no matter what I do, I die this turn.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
