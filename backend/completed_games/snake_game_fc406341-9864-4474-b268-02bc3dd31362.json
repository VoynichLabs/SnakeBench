Moving UP to (6, 5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (6, 7). This seems advantageous.\n2. Moving LEFT to (5, 4) would move me away from the nearest apple.\n3. The enemy snake is at (7, 5), so I should be cautious of potential collisions if we both move toward the same space.\n\nLooking at future moves:\n- If I go UP now, I could go UP again next turn to reach (6, 6), then UP again to reach the apple at (6, 7).\n- The enemy snake at (7, 5) might be targeting the same apple, but I'm slightly closer.\n\nThe UP direction looks most advantageous as it moves me toward an apple while keeping me in open space. This also maintains distance from the enemy snake, reducing collision risk.\n\nFor my next turn strategy, I should continue moving toward the apple at (6, 7) unless the enemy snake poses an immediate threat.\n\nUP"
