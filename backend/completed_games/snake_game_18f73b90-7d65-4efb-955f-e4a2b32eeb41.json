They are likely to move UP if seeking apples, but cannot reach my area quickly. No immediate head-to-head risk.\n\nLong-term plan (for next turns):\n- Move UP now to approach (3,6). On the next turn aim LEFT to eat (3,6). After growing, pivot toward the cluster of top apples (4,8), (9,7) while keeping space to avoid being boxed in. Prioritize staying in open areas and avoid narrow corners near the board edge unless I outnumber the opponent in apples.\n\nMove: \nUP",

Our head is at (3,0). We have no body segments (length 1). The enemy has no body segments (length 1).\n\nWe must consider all four moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Board Boundaries:**\n    *   (3,0) is on the bottom edge (y=0). DOWN would move to y=-1, which is off the board -> DEATH. So DOWN is invalid.\n    *   Other directions stay within bounds (0-9).\n\n2.  **Collision with Bodies:**\n    *   **Self:** No body segments -> no self-collision risk.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Enemy has no body segments (only a head at (4,6)) -> no enemy body collision risk.\n\n3.  **Potential Head-on Collisions (Simultaneous Movement):**\n    *   **Enemy Head:** Located at (4,6). It is currently far away (Manhattan distance 10 units: |4-3| + |6-0| = 10). Even if it moves directly toward us (e.g., DOWN), it will still be far away (e.g., at (4,5) after one move).\n    *   **Our Moves:**\n        *   UP to (3,1): Distance to enemy (4,6) becomes |4-3| + |6-1| = 6. No collision risk.\n        *   LEFT to (2,0): Distance to enemy (4,6) becomes |4-2| + |6-0| = 8. No collision risk.\n        *   RIGHT to (4,0): Distance to enemy (4,6) becomes |4-4| + |6-0| = 6. No collision risk.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n4.  **Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n    *   Apples visible: (3,1), (2,0), (1,3), (0,2), (0,4), (0,9), (1,8), (2,1), (3,6), (4,8), (6,3), (7,0), (7,1), (7,4), (9,7).\n    *   **Left (2,0):** Moves to (2,0). There is an apple at (2,0). This would consume an apple immediately, growing our snake to length 2.\n    *   **UP (3,1):** Moves to (3,1). There is an apple at (3,1). This would consume an apple immediately, growing our snake to length 2.\n    *   **Right (4,0):** Moves to (4,0). This cell is empty.\n\n    *   **Comparison of Left vs UP (Best Options):**\n        *   Both moves lead to an immediate apple.\n        *   **Left to (2,0):** Places us at x=2, y=0. We are near the left wall. The apple at (2,1) is adjacent and accessible next turn (up). The apple at (1,3) is also nearby. However, being at the wall restricts some future movement compared to being more central.\n        *   **UP to (3,1):** Places us at x=3, y=1. This is slightly more central than (2,0). We are adjacent to apples at (2,1) (left-up) and (3,6) (straight up). Being at (3,1) keeps the path open to the upper half of the board where many apples are located (e.g., (3,6), (4,8), (1,8)). The enemy is currently at (4,6), so moving up aligns us with the central column where action is likely to happen.\n\n    *   **Decision:** Moving UP to (3,1) seems strategically better than moving LEFT to (2,0). While both secure an apple, (3,1) offers better board positioning for the next turns, avoiding the immediate wall and setting up a route to the cluster of apples in the upper half. Moving to (2,0) puts us against the wall immediately, which might limit options if the enemy approaches from the right side.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (3,1) to eat the apple. This positions us centrally on the left side, ready to navigate towards the upper apples (like 3,6) or the left side cluster (1,3, 0,2). We will assess the enemy's movement next turn to decide if we should continue up or pivot towards the side apples.\n\nUP",

No bodies block adjacent squares. The strongest immediate gain is to take the apple at (3,6) now.\n\nShort-term plan after LEFT:\n- Eat (3,6), then avoid moving RIGHT (back into my new tail). Prefer moving UP to (3,7) or UP/RIGHT later to reach the cluster at y=8 and (9,7).\n- Keep to the open upper half to collect (4,8),(1,8),(9,7) while avoiding corners and not allowing the enemy to trap me (enemy is distant).\n- Maintain at least 2 escape options each turn; avoid getting boxed next to the wall with a longer body behind me.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Based on the analysis of the game state and my previous move, I'm ready to make my next decision.\n\n**Analysis of Turn 2:**\n\n1.  **Current State (After moving UP to (3,1) on Turn 1):**\n    *   **My Position:** Head at (3,1), Body at (3,0). (Length 2).\n    *   **Apple Status:** I ate the apple at (3,1) on the previous turn. However, the game state provided shows the apple is still at (3,1). This implies that the apple respawned or the state view is pre-consumption for the *next* move consideration. Wait, looking closer at the provided state: \"Apples at: (6, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1)...\" The apple at (3,1) is **NOT** listed in the provided state on Turn 2.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (3,6) (Head) and (4,6) (Body). They moved LEFT. (Manhattan distance: |3-3| + |6-1| = 5).\n    *   **Apples:** The remaining apples are listed. (2,1) is still there. (2,0) is still there. (1,3) is still there. (3,6) is still there.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from (3,1):**\n    *   **UP to (3,2):**\n        *   Safe? Yes, within bounds. No body there (My body: (3,0), Enemy: (3,6), (4,6)). No immediate head-on collision (Enemy distance is 4).\n        *   Value: (3,2) is empty. This moves me away from the apples at (2,1) and (2,0) and closer to the enemy at (3,6). Not ideal.\n    *   **DOWN to (3,0):**\n        *   Safe? Yes, within bounds. However, this is my own tail position. If I move here, my head moves into where my tail was. Since my tail will move forward (or shrink if I don't eat), moving into my own tail is usually safe *if* I don't eat an apple this turn (tail moves away). Wait, if I move DOWN to (3,0), I am moving into my body. The rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" BUT, there is an exception for tails. If the tail moves away, the spot becomes free.\n        *   Let's look at the board: My body is [(3,0)]. The head is at (3,1). Moving DOWN puts the head at (3,0). The old tail (3,0) will move... but if I don't eat, the tail moves to (3,0)? No, if I don't eat, the tail moves to the position of the previous body segment. My body only has one segment (3,0). If I move DOWN to (3,0), I am technically hitting my body. However, standard snake rules usually allow moving into the tail spot because the tail moves forward.\n        *   Let's check the specific rules provided: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n        *   Moving DOWN is moving directly backwards into my own body (the only body segment). This is explicitly forbidden. **DOWN is DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT to (2,1):**\n        *   Safe? Yes. (2,1) is an apple (listed in state). No collision.\n        *   Value: Eats an apple. Increases length to 3. Good.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4,1):**\n        *   Safe? Yes. (4,1) is empty.\n        *   Value: No apple. Moves me to a generic empty spot.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    *   **Eliminate:** UP (empty space, bad positioning), RIGHT (empty space, bad positioning), DOWN (suicide).\n    *   **Best:** LEFT to (2,1). This guarantees an apple, grows the snake, and keeps me on the left side where I can access (2,0) or (1,3) next.\n    *   **Long-term Plan:** Secure apples on the left side (2,0, 1,3, 0,2) to build length. Avoid the enemy at (3,6) who is directly above. Once sufficiently long, perhaps pivot to the upper right if the enemy dies or moves away.\n\nLEFT",

Analysis of Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (2, 1)\n    *   **Body:** [(3, 1), (3, 0)]\n    *   **Length:** 3 (Head + 2 Body segments)\n    *   **Last Move:** LEFT (I moved from (3, 1) to (2, 1)).\n    *   **Observation:** I am currently on the apple at (2, 1). However, the \"Apples at\" list provided in the prompt for Turn 3 *includes* (2, 1).\n    *   *Interpretation:* The prompt lists all active apples for the current turn. Since I am at (2, 1) and it is listed, I am currently standing on an apple I have not yet collected (or the system tracks it until the turn resolves). I will consume it when I move *off* it, or the logic implies I collect it upon entering. Standard Snake rules usually collect upon entering. If I stay put, I don't collect. I should move to collect it.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:**\n    *   **Head:** (3, 7)\n    *   **Body:** [(3, 6)]\n    *   **Distance:** Manhattan distance is |3-2| + |7-1| = 7. Safe for now, but he is directly above me.\n*   **Apples:** There are many apples. Relevant nearby: (2, 1) [Current location], (1, 3), (2, 0), (0, 2).\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves from (2, 1):**\nI must move to a new cell. I cannot stay at (2, 1). My body is at (3, 1) (Left) and (3, 0) (Down-Left).\n\n*   **UP to (2, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 2) is empty (Board shows '.'). My body is at (3, 1) and (3, 0). No collision.\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves away from the apple at (2, 1) without collecting it. Moves closer to the enemy (Snake #0) at (3, 7). Not ideal.\n\n*   **DOWN to (2, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 0) is an apple (listed). No body there.\n    *   **Outcome:** Collects an apple. Grows to length 4. My tail (3, 0) will move forward (likely to 3, 1) as I don't eat another apple simultaneously.\n    *   **Long term:** Opens up (1, 0) and (2, 1) (which becomes empty).\n\n*   **LEFT to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 1) is empty (Board shows '.'). No body there.\n    *   **Outcome:** Empty space. Does not collect the apple at (2, 1). (1, 3) is nearby but requires 2 moves.\n    *   **Risk:** Puts me at (1, 1). My previous position (2, 1) becomes part of the body. If I am forced to turn around immediately, I might hit my own body. Low flexibility.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 1) is my *current* body segment (the one immediately behind my head).\n    *   **Rule:** \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   **Outcome:** **DEATH.**\n\n**3. Decision & Strategy:**\n*   **Eliminated:** UP (Leaves apple, moves toward enemy), RIGHT (Suicide).\n*   **Contenders:** DOWN (Collects apple at 2,0) and LEFT (Empty space).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (2, 0) allows me to collect an apple immediately, increasing my score to 3. It keeps me in the lower-left area which is rich in apples (0, 2, 1, 3).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (1, 1) is safe but inefficient. It misses the apple at (2, 1) and delays growth.\n    *   My last move was LEFT. I am currently at (2, 1). The board layout shows I am in a good position to sweep the bottom row or the column at x=2.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove **DOWN** to (2, 0) to collect the apple. This secures a point and maintains momentum. From (2, 0), I can then move to (1, 0) or (0, 0) to target the cluster of apples on the left side (0, 2, 1, 3). I will avoid the enemy at (3, 7) by staying on the left side of the board.\n\n**Move:**\nDOWN",

(1, 0) is not in this list.\n        *   **Enemy Body:** Enemy is at (3, 8) and (3, 7). Safe.\n        *   **Enemy Head Prediction:** If the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 8), they are far away. Even if they move LEFT to (2, 8), the distance is large. No collision risk.\n        *   **Board Boundary:** (1, 0) is on the board.\n    *   **Value:**\n        *   **Apple:** (1, 0) is empty ('.' in the board state).\n        *   **Position:** Moves me towards the cluster of apples at (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 3).\n        *   **Future:** From (1, 0), I can go to (0, 0) (Apple at (0, 1) is reachable next), or (1, 1), or UP to (1, 1).\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe and strategic.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (3, 0)**\n    *   **Target:** (3, 0).\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   **My Body:** My body is at (3, 1) and (3, 0) (tail). (3, 0) is the tail.\n        *   **Rule:** \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards... counts as hitting yourself.\"\n        *   **Wait:** Is (3, 0) part of the body?\n            *   Current Head: (2, 0).\n            *   Body list: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)].\n            *   (3, 0) is the last element (tail).\n            *   If I move to (3, 0), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my tail.\n            *   *Crucial Logic:* In standard Snake mechanics (simultaneous movement), the tail usually moves *after* the head. If I eat an apple (grow), the tail stays. If I don't eat, the tail moves forward.\n            *   However, the rule provided is strict: \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\" The body list *is* the body.\n            *   *Refinement:* The body list is [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. The head is at (2, 0).\n            *   If I move to (3, 0), I am moving into the current position of the tail.\n            *   If I do not eat an apple (there is no apple at (3, 0)), the tail will move to (3, 1) (the next segment).\n            *   So, the cell (3, 0) becomes empty *after* the move.\n            *   *However*, many game engines check collision against the *current* state or the *projected* state. Given the strict warning \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die,\" I should be extremely careful.\n            *   Looking at the board: `0 . . 1 T . . A . . .`\n                *   (3, 0) is labeled 'T' (Tail).\n                *   (2, 0) is '1' (Head).\n                *   (3, 0) is occupied by my tail.\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (3, 0), I am moving into my own tail.\n            *   *Is it safe?* In simultaneous movement, if I don't eat, the tail moves to (3, 1). So (3, 0) becomes empty. But is the collision check done before or after the body update?\n            *   Given the \"Death\" warnings, it's safer to assume strict collision.\n            *   Let's look at the body list: `[(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]`. The head is at `(2, 0)`.\n            *   If I move Right to `(3, 0)`, I am moving into a cell occupied by my own body *at the start of the turn*.\n            *   Standard snake logic: The head moves, then the tail moves (if no food). So the cell `(3, 0)` is currently occupied by the tail. The head moves there. The tail moves away.\n            *   BUT, the prompt says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This usually applies to the *current* frame.\n            *   However, moving into your own tail is a specific edge case.\n            *   Let's look at the board again.\n                *   Row 0: `. . 1 T . . . A . .`\n                *   My head is at `1` (2,0).\n                *   My tail is at `T` (3,0).\n                *   If I move RIGHT, I go to (3,0). The tail is there.\n                *   If I DON'T eat, the tail moves to (3,1). (3,0) becomes empty.\n                *   Is this a collision?\n                *   Usually, it's safe. *However*, if I were to eat an apple at (3,0), I would grow and the tail wouldn't move. Then I would collide with myself immediately? No, the head is at (2,0), the tail at (3,0). I move to (3,0). The tail stays. I am now occupying the same cell as my tail. That is a collision.\n                *   Wait, if I eat, the body grows. The new head is (3,0). The old body becomes [(2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,0)]. The tail remains (3,0)? No, the tail is the last element.\n                *   Let's step back. Is there an apple at (3,0)? No. The apple at (2,0) is what I am sitting on. The apple at (3,0) is not listed. The apples are: (6,3), (7,0), (1,3), (0,4), (1,8), (7,1), (4,8), (0,9), (9,7), (0,2), (7,4), (7,9), (5,4), (8,5), (0,1).\n                *   (3,0) has no apple. So I will not grow.\n                *   Therefore, the tail will move from (3,0) to (3,1) (the next body segment).\n                *   So the head moves to (3,0) and the tail moves away. (3,0) becomes the new head. (3,1) becomes the new... neck? No, the body slides.\n                *   This is a standard \"chasing tail\" move. It is generally safe *unless* there is an obstacle.\n                *   Is (3,0) blocked? No.\n                *   **However**, looking at my body list: `[(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)]`.\n                *   If I move RIGHT to (3,0), the new head is (3,0).\n                *   The new body will be `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]` (assuming no growth).\n                *   Wait. If I move to (3,0), the cell (3,0) is currently occupied by my tail.\n                *   Standard logic: Head moves to (3,0). Body segments shift. Tail moves from (3,0) to (3,1).\n                *   Result: Head at (3,0), Body at [(2,0), (2,1), (3,1)].\n                *   Is this valid? Yes, usually.\n                *   **But**, there is a \"Head-on collision\" risk or simply running into a body that hasn't moved yet.\n                *   Let's check the specific wording: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n                *   At the *start* of the turn, the body is at (3,0). So moving there is technically moving into the body.\n                *   However, the \"Last Move Info\" I was given in the prompt shows the snake *did* move.\n                *   Let's reconsider. Is there a safer move?\n                *   Left to (1,0) is empty.\n                *   Down to (2,-1) is death (wall).\n                *   Up to (2,1) is death (into body).\n                *   Right to (3,0) is potentially safe if the tail moves away.\n                *   BUT, I am at (2,0). My body is (2,1), (3,1), (3,0).\n                *   The snake is a loop? No. (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0).\n                *   It's a shape like:\n                    ```\n                      (2,1) (3,1)\n                      (2,0) (3,0)\n                    ```\n                *   If I move RIGHT to (3,0), I am moving into the tail.\n                *   If I move LEFT to (1,0), I am moving into open space.\n                *   Moving into the tail is risky if the game engine is strict about collision with *current* body positions before processing the tail movement.\n                *   Given the \"Death\" warnings, it is safer to move to an *empty* cell if possible.\n                *   (1,0) is empty.\n                *   (3,0) is currently occupied (by my tail).\n                *   I will choose LEFT.\n\n*   **Option 4: DOWN to (2, -1)**\n    *   **Target:** (2, -1).\n    *   **Safety:** Out of bounds (0-9).\n    *   **Result:** Death. Eliminated.\n\n**3. Comparison of Safe Moves**\n*   **LEFT (1, 0):**\n    *   Safe (empty cell).\n    *   Moves towards apple cluster at (0, 1), (0, 2).\n    *   Keeps options open (can go to 0,0 or 1,1 next).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 0):**\n    *   Potentially safe (moving into tail).\n    *   Moves towards the right side (apple at 7,0 is visible, but far).\n    *   My body is currently blocking a bit of the right side (at 3,1).\n    *   Moving LEFT seems more promising for immediate food and avoiding the enemy (who is on the right/center at x=3, y=8).\n\n**4. Long-term Strategy**\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Collect the apple at (0, 1) or (0, 2).\n*   **Enemy Watch:** Snake 0 is at (3, 8). It is high up. I am at (2, 0). We are far apart. I should focus on clearing the bottom-left corner.\n*   **Board Control:** The bottom row has apples at (0,1) and (0,2). The row above has (1,3). The left side is relatively open.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 0) is the most prudent choice. It avoids the ambiguity of moving into my own tail and positions me perfectly to eat the apples at (0, 1) and (0, 2) in the next turns. Moving RIGHT keeps me near the enemy's vertical column (x=3) and is less immediately rewarding.\n\nLEFT",

(0, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4) are nearby.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 1):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 1) is an apple. This is a valid move. My body shifts: old head (1,1) becomes body, tail (2,1) moves off (becoming (2,0) effectively). The cell (0,1) is currently empty in the \"board state\" representation (it shows `A` in the list, but board shows `.` at (1,1) which I just occupied, and (0,1) is an apple). *Correction*: The board state shows row 1 as `A 1 T . . . . . A . .`. At (0,1) there is `A`. I am at (1,1). Moving Left to (0,1) eats the apple.\n    *   **Trapping Risk:** If I move LEFT to (0, 1), I am in the corner. My tail will be at (1, 0) (since (2,1) moves to (2,0) and (2,0) moves to (1,0) etc? Let's trace the tail precisely).\n        *   Current: Head (1,1). Body: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n        *   Move LEFT to (0,1). New Head (0,1).\n        *   New Body: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0).\n        *   From (0,1), available moves for next turn:\n            *   UP to (0,2) (Safe? Yes, has apple).\n            *   DOWN to (0,0) (Safe? Yes, empty).\n            *   LEFT is wall.\n            *   RIGHT to (1,1) (Next turn my body will be there? Yes, I just vacated it). **DEAD**.\n    *   So from (0,1), I can go UP or DOWN. It's not a *total* trap, but it limits me to 2 directions. Specifically, if I go DOWN to (0,0) next, I will be in the bottom-left corner with only UP available (RIGHT would be into my own body).\n\n2.  **UP to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 2) is empty on the board (`.`).\n    *   **Future Options:** From (1, 2), I have access to (1, 3) [Apple], (0, 2) [Apple], (2, 2) [Empty]. This keeps me in the \"corridor\" near the apples.\n    *   **Current Apple:** I am currently on (0, 1). If I move UP to (1, 2), I *do not* eat the apple at (0, 1). Is this bad?\n        *   *Self-Correction*: Wait, look at the board state again. `A 1 T . . .` at row 1. The `A` is at (0,1). The `1` is at (1,1). I am sitting on (1,1). The apple is at (0,1). I am NOT on the apple. I need to move LEFT to eat it.\n\n    *   *Re-evaluating (0,1) again*: If I go LEFT to (0,1), I eat an apple. My body grows. My tail (2,1) does not move (because I ate). My body becomes (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1). I am at (0,1).\n    *   Next turn options from (0,1):\n        *   UP (0,2) - Apple there.\n        *   DOWN (0,0) - Empty.\n        *   RIGHT (1,1) - Blocked by my own body (segment (1,1) is now part of my body).\n        *   LEFT - Wall.\n    *   This is actually a tight spot. If I go UP to (0,2), I am still cornered.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (4,9). It is at the top edge. It can only move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. It is far from me. No immediate collision threat.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Option A (Greedy):** Eat the apple at (0,1) now.\n        *   Pro: +1 Point, Growth.\n        *   Con: Puts me in the corner (0,1) with limited exits. Next turn I likely have to go UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0). If I go UP to (0,2), I am still near the wall.\n    *   **Option B (Safe):** Ignore (0,1) for a moment and move UP to (1,2).\n        *   Pro: Keeps me central. From (1,2), I can go to (1,3), (2,2), (0,2). I can circle back to (0,1) later if it remains safe, or just avoid the corner entirely.\n        *   Con: Leaving an apple on the board.\n\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n        Row 0: `. T T A . . . A . .`\n        Row 1: `A 1 T . . . . . A . .`\n        Row 2: `A . . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    If I move UP to (1,2):\n    *   My head: (1,2).\n    *   My body: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0).\n    *   Next turn options:\n        *   UP to (1,3) - Apple!\n        *   LEFT to (0,2) - Apple!\n        *   RIGHT to (2,2) - Empty.\n        *   DOWN to (1,1) - My body (dead).\n    *   This gives me **3 safe directions** (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). This is much better than the 2 directions from (0,1) or (0,2).\n\n    *   Furthermore, if I go UP to (1,2), I can eat (1,3) or (0,2) next turn. I can then loop around.\n    *   If I eat (0,1) now, I am forced into a bottleneck.\n    *   **Wait, check the board state for (1,2).** It is empty `.`.\n    *   **Check (0,1).** It is an apple `A`.\n\n    **Revised Plan:**\n    Avoid the corner trap. Even though (0,1) is an apple, taking it forces me into a positional disadvantage where I am sandwiched against the wall. Moving UP to (1,2) maintains freedom of movement. From (1,2), I can easily access the cluster of apples at (1,3), (0,2), and (3,0) (via (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) if needed, though (2,0) and (2,1) are currently my body, they will shift).\n    \n    Actually, looking at (1,2):\n    If I go UP to (1,2), next turn I can go LEFT to (0,2) and eat that apple. Or UP to (1,3) and eat that apple. Both are safer approaches than sitting on the edge at (0,1).\n\n    **Decision:** Move UP to (1,2). It keeps me alive and options open. I will grab an apple next turn.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Tail (2,0) remains (since I ate).\n    *   Cons: If I eat (1,3), my body will snake back down.

Empty.\n        *   (0, 1): Row 1 shows `A` at index 0. Apple (but currently occupied by my tail? No, my body is at (1,0) and (2,0), so (0,1) is actually empty space). Wait, looking at the board state for Row 1: `A T . . . . . A . .`. The `A` at (0,1) is an apple. The `T` at (1,0) is my tail.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (0,2) and eat the apple, my body grows. Next turn, if I go DOWN to (0,1), I eat another apple. If I go UP to (0,3), I continue up the wall.\n    *   **Risk:** Being on the left wall (x=0) limits directions. However, since I am eating an apple, I am growing. I need to ensure I don't get trapped. The path UP the left wall looks relatively clear.\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2) - No Apple:**\n    *   Pros: Opens up the right side of the board.\n    *   Cons: Does not gain points. My tail (2,0) will move forward to (1,0), leaving (2,0) empty. This opens up a path for me to potentially circle back, but it's slower point-wise.\n\n**3. Comparative Analysis & Decision:**\n\nThe objective is to collect apples and outlast the enemy.\n*   **Option UP (1,3):** Eat apple. Access to (1,4).\n*   **Option LEFT (0,2):** Eat apple. Access to (0,1) (apple) or (0,3).\n*   **Option RIGHT (2,2):** No apple. Access to open space.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT offer immediate point gains. Let's look at the density of apples.\nLeft wall (x=0): (0,1) is an apple, (0,2) is an apple, (0,4) is an apple, (0,9) is an apple.\nCenter/Right: (1,3) is an apple, (3,0) is an apple, etc.\n\nChoosing **LEFT** to (0,2) puts me directly on an apple and adjacent to another apple at (0,1).\nWait, looking at the board state for Row 2: `A . . . . . . . . .`\nThis is (0,2) = Apple.\nRow 1: `A T . . . . . A . .` -> (0,1) = Apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,2), I am on the left wall.\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (0,1) to eat another apple.\nOr UP to (0,3).\n(0,3) is empty (Row 3 index 0 is `.`).\n(0,4) is an apple (Row 4 index 0 is `A`).\n(0,5) is empty (Row 5 index 0 is `.`).\n(0,6) is empty.\n(0,7) is empty.\n(0,8) is empty.\n(0,9) is an apple.\n\nI can easily move up the left wall eating apples. This seems like a safe, high-yield path.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,3), I am at (1,3).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (1,4) (empty), LEFT to (0,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,3) (empty).\n(1,4) leads to (1,5) (empty), (1,6) (empty), etc. Fewer immediate apples compared to the left wall cluster.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to (0,2).\nReasoning: Secures an immediate apple. Positions me on the left wall where there is a clear path to collect multiple apples sequentially ((0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,4) -> ...). This is a safe, high-scoring trajectory.\n\n**Safety Check:**\nMoving LEFT to (0,2).\nMy body will be: [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)].\n(0,2) is currently empty.\nEnemy snake is at (5,9). No collision threat.\nSelf-collision: Moving from (1,2) to (0,2). Previous body segments are (1,1), (1,0), (2,0). None are (0,2). Safe.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0,2) to eat the apple. Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (0,1) to eat that apple too, or UP to (0,3) to head towards (0,4).\n\nLEFT",

This is usually allowed *if* the tail moves away in the same turn (simultaneous movement).\n        *   However, checking the rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n        *   If I am at (0,0) and move RIGHT to (1,0), is that \"directly backwards\"? No, backwards would be (0,1).\n        *   Is (1,0) occupied? Yes, by my tail.\n        *   Standard snake rules: If you move into the cell where your tail currently is, you survive because the tail moves away. Unless you ate this turn (tail doesn't move).\n        *   I didn't eat at Turn 9 (moved from (0,1) to (0,0)). So the tail (1,0) *will* move.\n        *   So (0,0) -> (1,0) is likely safe.\n        *   From (1,0), I can go to (2,0) or (1,1).\n        *   (2,0) is currently my body. (1,1) is currently my body.\n        *   If I am at (1,0) at Turn 10, my body is [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1)].\n        *   (2,0) is empty. (1,1) is occupied.\n        *   So I could go to (2,0).\n        *   This path is getting complicated and risks trapping myself in the bottom-left corner.\n\n*   **UP (0, 3) Analysis:**\n    *   Move UP to (0,3).\n    *   Body becomes [(0,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0)].\n    *   Next turn, I can go UP to (0,4) (Apple) or DOWN (back to (0,2), blocked by body) or RIGHT (to (1,3)).\n    *   (1,3) is an apple. (0,4) is an apple.\n    *   Moving UP keeps me on the edge but allows me to climb up the ladder. This is a standard, safe pattern.\n\n**Comparative Decision:**\n*   **DOWN to (0,1):** Eats an apple. Traps me in the corner eventually. High immediate reward, high long-term risk.\n*   **UP to (0,3):** No immediate apple. Opens up the path to (0,4), (0,5)... (0,9). Also allows cutting inward to (1,3) or (1,4).\n*   **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 is at (6,9). No immediate threat.\n*   **Score:** I have 4 apples, Enemy has 2. I am winning.\n*   **Strategy:** \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both: increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\"\n\nThe DOWN move risks trapping myself in the corner (0,0). The UP move keeps options open to move along the wall or cut inward. Even though UP doesn't eat immediately, it positions me for (0,4) or (1,3), both of which are apples, and avoids the corner trap. This is the safer long-term play.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (0,3) to avoid the bottom-left corner trap. From there, I can target the apple at (0,4) or cut right to (1,3). This maintains flexibility and safety.\n\nUP",

Decision:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and lead to eating an apple immediately. However, UP is the superior strategic move. Staying on the wall (especially the left wall) is often a safe, conservative strategy in Snake games because it eliminates one direction of attack (Left) and simplifies future pathfinding. From the wall, I can continue to climb towards the apple at (0,9) or decide to cut inward later if necessary. Moving RIGHT to (1,3) cuts inward, potentially restricting my future movement if the body grows or the enemy approaches.\n\nBy choosing UP, I secure an apple and maintain a safe position on the edge, keeping my options open for the next move along the wall.\n\nUP",

Board row 3 shows `T A . A`. At X=1, Y=3 is `A` (Apple). But the user says body is [(0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)].\n        *   *Correction:* The board state provided in the text is the visual representation.\n        *   Let's map the user's provided list: `Head: (0, 4), Body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]`.\n        *   Does this match the board?\n            *   (0, 4): `1` -> Yes.\n            *   (0, 3): `T` -> Yes.\n            *   (0, 2): `T` -> Yes.\n            *   (1, 2): `T` -> Yes.\n            *   (1, 1): `T` -> Yes.\n            *   (1, 0): `T` -> Yes.\n        *   So the provided list is correct. The board visual confirms it (ignoring the apple at (1,3) in the visual for the sake of the provided logic, or perhaps the apple was eaten last turn and the board isn't fully updated yet? No, the apples list includes (1,3). *Wait, the apples list includes (1,3). The board shows (1,3) as 'A'.*\n        *   *Conflict:* User says body is at (0,3) and (0,2).

The user list excludes (1,3).\n        *   **Wait:** The user list says `Body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]`.\n        *   The board visual at (1,3) is `A`. This means (1,3) is an apple, not a body segment.\n        *   *Conclusion:* The board matches the provided list perfectly.

No.\n        *   Is it Self? No.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves along the left wall. Keeps me safe on the edge.

(1,4) is empty.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's re-evaluate the \"Apple\" at (0,4).**\n        *   The prompt says: \"My last move: UP\". This implies I moved from (0,3) to (0,4).\n        *   Did I eat the apple at (0,4)? Yes.\n        *   *Check Board State:* Row 4 is `1 . . . . . A . A . .`.\n        *   The `1` is at index 0. The `A` is at index 5.\n        *   **Wait!** The board state provided shows `(0,4)` as `1` (my head). The apple at `(0,4)` is **NOT** listed in the visual board.\n        *   Let's look at the text list of apples: `(6, 3), (7, 0), (1, 3), (1, 8), (7, 1), (0, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (5, 4), (8, 5), (0, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 8), (4, 6)`.\n        *   **Wait, is (0,4) in that list?** No.\n        *   **Is (1,3) in that list?** Yes.\n        *   **Is (0,5) in that list?** No.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the \"Last Move\" Rationale provided by the user:**\n        *   User says: \"My current position is (0, 3)\". Wait, the prompt says \"Your snake...

The user's \"Last Rationale\" was incorrect about (0,4) being an apple. Or perhaps the apples list is slightly off/visual board is slightly off.\n        *   Let's trust the **Current State** \"Apples at:\" list.\n        *   Apples near (0,4):\n            *   (1, 3) - Distance 1 (Diagonal/Adjacent)\n            *   (0, 1) - Distance 3 (Down)\n            *   (0, 9) - Distance 5 (Up)\n            *   (3, 3) - Distance 3 (Right/Up)\n\n    *   **Safety Check for Turn 10 (From Head 0,4):**\n        *   **UP (0, 5):**\n            *   Visual Board Row 5: `. . . . . .` at indices 0-5. (0,5) is empty.\n            *   Is it in my body? My body is [(0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0)]. No.\n            *   Is it in enemy body? Enemy is at (5-8, 9). No.\n            *   **Safe.**\n        *   **DOWN (0, 3):**\n            *   Visual Board Row 3: `T` at index 0. (0,3) is my body.\n            *   **Unsafe.**\n        *   **LEFT (-1, 4):**\n            *   Out of bounds.\n            *   **Unsafe.**\n        *   **RIGHT (1, 4):**\n            *   Visual Board Row 4: `.` at index 1. (1,4) is empty.\n            *   Is it in my body? No.\n            *   Is it in enemy body? No.\n            *   **Safe.**\n\n    *   **Strategic Choice:**\n        *   **Option UP (0,5):** Moves towards (0,9) (Apple). Keeps me on the left wall. This is generally a safe \"turtle\" strategy. Wall provides 180 degree safety (can't be attacked from left).\n        *   **Option RIGHT (1,4):** Moves into the open. (1,3) is an apple (per list). If I go RIGHT to (1,4), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,3) to eat the apple.\n        *   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (8,9). It's a vertical snake on the right wall. It might be moving down or staying put. It is far away and not an immediate threat to my decision at (0,4).\n        *   **Apple Priority:** I have 5 apples. Enemy has 3. I am winning.\n        *   **Growth:** I am currently length 6 (Head + 5 body).\n        *   **Pathing:**\n            *   If I go UP: (0,4) -> (0,5). Next options: (0,6) or (1,5).\n            *   If I go RIGHT: (0,4) -> (1,4). Next options: (1,5), (2,4), or (1,3).\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   (0,5) is empty.\n        *   (1,4) is empty.\n        *   Both are safe.\n        *   Which offers better future flexibility?\n            *   From (0,5): Can go Up, Right, Down (but Down is (0,4) which is where I am now, which will be occupied by my body next turn? No, wait. If I move from (0,4) to (0,5), (0,4) becomes body. (0,3) becomes body. (0,2) moves to (0,3)? No, the tail moves.\n            *   Actually, let's look at the tail. Tail is (1,0). The body snakes around.\n            *   If I go UP: I am stacking vertically on the left.\n            *   If I go RIGHT: I am opening up the board.\n\n    *   **Let's look at the apples again.**\n        *   (1,3) is an apple.\n        *   If I go UP to (0,5), I am moving away from (1,3).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (1,4), I am moving *closer* to (1,3).\n        *   However, (1,4) is directly above (1,3).\n        *   Is (1,4) safe?\n        *   (1,4) is empty on board.\n        *   My body is at (0,3), (0,2)... so (1,4) is clear.\n        *   Enemy is at top right. Clear.\n        *   So, RIGHT seems good for grabbing the (1,3) apple next turn.\n\n    *   **Wait, check (1,3) again.**\n        *   Board shows (1,3) as `A`? No, look at the visual board again.\n        *   Row 3: `T A . A . . A . . .`\n        *   Indices: 0:T, 1:A, 2:., 3:A...\n        *   Yes, (1,3) is an apple.\n        *   Row 4: `1 . . . . . A . A . .`\n        *   Indices: 0:1, 1:.\n        *   So (1,4) is empty.\n\n    *   **Is there any trap?**\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (1,4):\n            *   Next turn I can go DOWN to (1,3) (Apple).\n            *   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,4) (Empty).\n            *   Next turn I can go UP to (1,5) (Empty).\n        *   If I go UP to (0,5):\n            *   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (1,5) (Empty).\n            *   Next turn I can go UP to (0,6) (Empty).\n            *   Next turn I can go DOWN to (0,4) (My tail? No, my tail is at (1,0). My body will shift. (0,4) will be occupied by my body (specifically the segment that is currently at (0,3))).\n\n    *   **Let's look at the body movement.**\n        *   Current: Head(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0).\n        *   If I move UP to (0,5):\n            *   New Head: (0,5).\n            *   New Body: [(0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1)].\n            *   Tail moves from (1,0) to (1,1)? No, wait.\n            *   If I eat an apple, I grow. But (0,5) is NOT an apple.\n            *   So I do not grow. The tail moves forward.\n            *   New Tail: (1,0) is removed. (1,1) becomes tail? No.\n            *   Sequence:\n                1.  Head moves to (0,5).\n                2.  Segment 1 moves to (0,4).\n                3.  Segment 2 moves to (0,3).\n                4.  Segment 3 moves to (0,2).\n                5.  Segment 4 moves to (1,2).\n                6.  Segment 5 moves to (1,1).\n                7.  Old tail (1,0) is removed.\n            *   So my new body is [(0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1)].\n            *   Is (0,5) safe relative to this new body?

Yes.\n\n    *   **One detail:**\n        *   The board shows `(0, 9)` is `T T T 0`. Wait.\n        *   Row 9: `9 A . . . . T T T 0 .`\n        *   Indices 6, 7, 8 are `T`. Index 9 is `0`.\n        *   So the enemy body is at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) and head at (9,9)? No, head is at (8,9) according to user text.\n        *   User text: `Head: (8, 9), Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]`.\n        *   Board visual shows `T T T 0` at the end.\n        *   This suggests (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) are body, and (9,9) is head?\n        *   No, user says Head is (8,9).\n        *   There might be a slight mismatch in visual vs text, but the text is usually authoritative for game logic.\n        *   Regardless, the enemy is in the top right. My move is bottom left/middle. No interaction.\n\n    *   **The plan is solid.**\n    *   Move RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Correction:** The user provided \"Last Rationale\" said they moved UP from (0,3) to (0,4) because (0,4) was an apple.\n    *   The current state does NOT show (0,4) as an apple.\n    *   This implies the apple was eaten? Or the rationale was wrong.\n    *   If the apple was eaten, my score should be 6.\n    *   The prompt says \"Your snake... Apples collected: 5\".\n    *   So the apple at (0,4) was NOT eaten. The user's rationale was flawed in assuming it was an apple.\n    *   I am at (0,4). It is NOT an apple.\n    *   I need to move to an apple.\n    *   (1,3) is the closest.\n    *   So RIGHT is definitely the move to target (1,3).\n\n    *   **One final check on \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".**\n        *   My previous move was UP (from 0,3 to 0,4).\n        *   \"Down\" would be (0,3), which is my old position. This is the \"backwards\" move.\n        *   The rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n        *   So DOWN is forbidden. (Checked in step 1).\n        *   LEFT is out of bounds.\n        *   UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n    *   **Why UP was chosen last time:**\n        *   Last time user was at (0,3).\n        *   Options: UP (0,4), RIGHT (1,3), DOWN (0,2 - body), LEFT (-1,3 - wall).\n        *   Last time, (0,4) was empty. (1,3) was an apple.\n        *   User chose UP to stay on the wall.\n        *   Now I am at (0,4).\n        *   I can go UP (0,5) or RIGHT (1,4).\n        *   (1,4) is closer to (1,3) apple.\n        *   (0,5) is closer to (0,9) apple.\n        *   (1,3) is much closer than (0,9).\n        *   So RIGHT is the tactical play.\n\n    *   **Action:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move RIGHT to (1,4). Next turn, move DOWN to eat apple at (1,3). Then move RIGHT to (2,3) to escape the trap.\n\n    *   **Wait, is (1,4) definitely empty?**\n        *   Board row 4: `1 . . . . . A . A . .`\n        *   Yes, index 1 is `.`.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n        *   Move: RIGHT.\n        *   New Head: (1,4).\n        *   Collisions: None.\n        *   Strategy: Good.\n\n    *   **One nuance:** The prompt says \"Your last move information: UP\". This confirms the move from (0,3) to (0,4) happened.\n    *   So I am definitely at (0,4).\n\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Self-Correction:**\n        *   Is there any reason to hesitate?\n        *   Moving RIGHT moves me into the open.\n        *   Moving UP moves me along the wall.\n        *   Wall is generally safer.\n        *   However, (1,3) is a valuable target.\n        *   If I go UP, I leave (1,3) for later.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I claim (1,3) next turn.\n        *   I have 5 apples. Enemy has 3.\n        *   I should play to increase my lead.\n\n    *   **What if I go RIGHT and then something goes wrong?**\n        *   From (1,4), if I go DOWN to (1,3) (Apple), I grow.\n        *   From (1,3), I can only go RIGHT.\n        *   From (2,3), I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n        *   (3,3) is an apple.\n        *   This is a valid path.\n\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Plan for next turn:**\n        *   Move DOWN to (1,3).\n        *   Eat apple.\n        *   Move RIGHT to (2,3).\n        *   Avoid getting trapped.\n\n    *   **Wait, check the \"Apples at\" list again.**\n        *   (1, 3) is in the list.\n        *   (3, 3) is in the list.\n        *   So the path (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) is a valid chain of apples.\n\n    *   **This makes RIGHT the best move.**\n\n    *   **Final Output:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a possibility of head-on collision?**\n        *   Enemy is at (8,9). It moves 1 step.\n        *   It cannot reach (1,4).\n        *   It cannot reach (1,3).\n        *   It cannot reach (2,3).\n        *   It cannot reach (3,3).\n        *   So no head-on collision.\n\n    *   **What about other snakes?**\n        *   Only Snake #0.\n        *   It is far away.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** RIGHT is safe and advantageous.\n\n    *   **One tiny detail:**\n        *   The board shows `(0, 1)` as an apple.\n        *   I am at (0,4).\n        *   (0,1) is down.\n        *   But down is blocked by my body.\n        *   So I can't get it immediately.\n        *   So RIGHT is the only way to expand my space and get points.\n\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Go RIGHT to set up for the apple at (1,3).\n\n    *   **Final check of the move:**\n        *   Current: (0,4).\n        *   Next: (1,4).\n        *   Safe: Yes.\n\n    *   **Output:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there any other apple nearby?**\n        *   (0,9) is far.\n        *   (1,3) is close.\n        *   (3,3) is close (if I get (1,3)).\n        *   (5,4) is close.\n        *   (4,6) is far.\n        *   (4,8) is far.\n        *   (1,8) is far.\n        *   (3,0) is far (blocked by body).\n        *   (0,1) is blocked by body.\n        *   (7,0) is far.\n        *   (6,3) is close.\n        *   (7,4) is close.\n        *   (7,1) is close.\n        *   (8,5) is far.\n        *   (9,7) is far.\n        *   So (1,3) is the best target.\n\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   I am at (0,4).\n        *   (1,3) is an apple.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (1,4) positions me to eat (1,3) on the next turn.\n        *   This is a safe and productive move.\n        *   Moving UP is safe but less productive.\n\n    *   **Output:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Wait, is (1,3) safe to EAT?**\n        *   If I eat at (1,3), I grow.\n        *   My body becomes longer.\n        *   From (1,3), I am forced to go RIGHT (to 2,3).\n        *   Is (2,3) safe?\n        *   Yes.\n        *   Is there any danger at (1,3)?\n        *   No.\n\n    *   **Final decision:** RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move RIGHT.

If the enemy moves toward the apple at (9,7) or explores the board, I need to be cautious but currently there's no immediate threat from the enemy.\n\nI should also consider that moving DOWN to (2,3) puts me one step closer to the apple at (1,3). From (2,3), I can eat that apple on the next turn.\n\nLet me also check what's at (2,3) again - row 3: \"T A . A . . A . . .\" - column 2 is \".\", so it's empty.\n\nGiven that LEFT is fatal, and I want to move toward apples, DOWN to (2,3) seems like the best move because it:\n1. Is safe (no collision)\n2. Gets me closer to the apple at (1,3)\n3. Keeps future options open (I can go to (1,3) for the apple next turn, or (3,3) toward other apples)\n4.
