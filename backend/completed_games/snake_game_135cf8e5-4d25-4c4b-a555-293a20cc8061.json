Wait, no, RIGHT would be (7, 6) to (8, 6) if we consider y as vertical and x as horizontal. Wait, let's clarify:\n   - Actually, in standard coordinate systems, moving RIGHT increases x, and moving LEFT decreases x.\n   - So RIGHT: (7, 6) to (8, 6)\n   - This is the same as DOWN in terms of coordinates if we consider y as vertical (up/down) and x as horizontal (left/right). Wait, no, let's clarify:\n     - Up: y increases (7,6) to (7,7)\n     - Down: y decreases (7,6) to (6,6)\n     - Left: x decreases (7,6) to (6,6)\n     - Right: x increases (7,6) to (8,6)\n\n   So:\n   - **RIGHT**: (7, 6) to (8, 6)\n     - Check if safe:\n       - No apple at (8, 6)\n       - No enemy head or body at (8, 6)\n       - No self-body at (8, 6)\n       - No off-board\n     - This move is safe.\n\n### Safe Moves:\nAll four directions are safe at this point.\n\n### Evaluating Each Safe Move:\n\n1. **UP (7,7)**:\n   - No apple here, but it's a safe move.\n   - The snake at (0,5) is moving towards the bottom-left, so it will likely not interfere with this move unless it moves into (7,7) on this turn, which seems unlikely.\n   - Moving up opens the possibility of reaching the apple at (1,7) in the next few turns.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,6)**:\n   - No apple here.\n   - Moving down might be safer in the long term as it keeps the snake more towards the bottom, away from the enemy's potential path.\n\n3. **LEFT (6,6)**:\n   - Same as DOWN in terms of coordinates, so this is incorrect. Wait, no, LEFT would be (7,6) to (6,6), which is the same as DOWN in terms of y-coordinate change. Wait, no, LEFT decreases x, so (7,6) to (6,6) is LEFT.\n   - This is the same as moving down in terms of y, but x decreases. So it's a different direction.\n   - Check if this is safe: Yes, no apple, no enemy, no self-body, no off-board.\n   - Moving left might be good to avoid the enemy's potential path.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,6)**:\n   - No apple here.\n   - Moving right might be less ideal as it moves the snake towards the enemy's potential path.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- The enemy snake is at (0,5) and has no body. It will likely move towards the bottom-left, possibly towards (0,0) or (1,0) or (0,1).\n- The apples are spread out, with (0,1) being the closest to the enemy's potential path.\n- Moving down or left might be safer to avoid the enemy's path and keep the snake in a more central position.\n- Moving up might be a good option to reach the apple at (1,7) in the next few turns.\n\n### Evaluating Follow-Up Moves:\n- If we move **UP (7,7)**, the next move could be LEFT or RIGHT to explore the top-left area.\n- If we move **DOWN (6,6)**, the next move could be LEFT or RIGHT to explore the bottom-left area.\n- If we move **LEFT (6,6)**, the next move could be UP or DOWN to explore the left side.\n\n### Collision Risk:\n- Enemy snake is at (0,5). Moving LEFT or DOWN might be safer as it keeps the snake away from the enemy's potential path.\n\n### Best Move:\nConsidering the enemy's potential path and the apples' locations, moving **LEFT (6,6)** seems to be the safest and most strategic move to avoid the enemy and explore the board.\n\n**LEFT**",

Wait, no\u2014the board shows the head is at **(5,7)** now, and the last move was LEFT from (5,8) to (5,7). But the board state shows the head at (5,7) with no body, implying the snake grew after eating an apple. Wait, the board state says \"Your snake (ID 1): Head: (5, 7), Body: none, Apples: 0\" but the last move was LEFT, so the head must have moved from (5,8) to (5,7). But the board shows the head at (5,7) with no body, which contradicts the last move being LEFT unless the snake grew after eating an apple. But the apples collected are 0, so this is inconsistent. I\u2019ll assume the head is at (5,7) with no body, and the last move was LEFT from (5,8) to (5,7), meaning the snake grew after eating an apple, but the apples collected are still 0. This suggests the last move was LEFT, and the snake grew after eating an apple, but the apples collected are not updated yet. For now, I\u2019ll proceed with the head at (5,7) and no body.\n\n**Safety Assessment:**\n- **UP:** (5,6) \u2192 safe from enemy (enemy is at (1,5), moving UP would go to (0,5) or (1,4)).\n- **DOWN:** (5,8) \u2192 safe, but enemy could move DOWN to (1,6) or RIGHT to (2,5).\n- **LEFT:** (4,7) \u2192 safe, but enemy could move LEFT to (0,5) or RIGHT to (2,5).\n- **RIGHT:** (6,7) \u2192 safe, but enemy could move RIGHT to (2,5) or DOWN to (1,6).\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (1,7) is closest at distance 2 (from (5,7) to (1,7)).\n- (0,1) is at distance 6.\n- (5,9) is at distance 2 (vertical distance).\n- (9,9) is at distance 4.\n- (8,8) is at distance 3.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- Enemy is at (1,5). If we move UP to (5,6), enemy could move UP to (0,5) or RIGHT to (2,5). No immediate collision.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,8) is safe but may not be optimal for apple chasing.\n- Moving LEFT to (4,7) is safe but may not be optimal for apple chasing.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe but may not be optimal for apple chasing.\n\n**Optimal Strategy:**\nThe closest apple is (1,7) at distance 2. Moving UP to (5,6) is safe and keeps options open. However, moving DOWN to (5,8) is closer to (5,9) apple. Moving LEFT to (4,7) is safe but not optimal. Moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe but not optimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move DOWN to (5,8) to approach (5,9) apple.\n2. If enemy moves away, continue moving toward (5,9) or (1,7).\n3. Avoid blocking myself in tight spaces.\n\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN\n\n---\n**Final Answer:** DOWN",

Would kill you\n- DOWN would take you to (1,8) - this is your body! Would kill you\n- LEFT would take you to (0,9) - safe\n- RIGHT would take you to (2,9) - safe\n\nSafe moves:\n1. LEFT to (0,9): Safe\n2. RIGHT to (2,9): Safe\n\nApple proximity:\n- Closest apples are at (0,1) and (0,0) - both 8 cells down from (0,9)\n- (5,2) is 3 right and 7 down\n- (8,8) and (9,9) are farther away\n\nEnemy movement:\n- Enemy is at (5,9) - same y-coordinate as you\n- Enemy is 4 cells to your right\n- If enemy moves left and you move right, we could have head-on collision\n\nBest move analysis:\n- LEFT to (0,9): Moves toward left edge and (0,1)/(0,0) apples\n  - Creates space between you and enemy\n  - Puts you in position to potentially get left-side apples\n  - But might trap you against left edge if you go too far left\n- RIGHT to (2,9): Moves toward enemy\n  - Risky if enemy moves left\n  - Could lead to head-on collision\n  - But might allow you to cut off enemy's access to top apples\n\nLEFT is the safer move as it:\n1.
