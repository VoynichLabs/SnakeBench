Leads toward (0,8) but follow-up moves: LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8); DOWN into own body dies. Only two safe follow-ups.\n- DOWN (1,6): Safe, but moves away from apples into open area; more safe follow-ups but delays progress. Risk if enemy advances aggressively south.\n- LEFT (0,7): Safe, empties; directly toward (0,8) via short path. Follow-up moves: UP (0,8 to eat), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7, but would be into own body then? Wait, after moving LEFT, body shifts to [(1,7), (2,7)], so RIGHT from (0,7) hits (1,7) own body. So UP, DOWN safe. Still two? Wait, RIGHT is (1,7) which is body, dead; LEFT off board dead. So UP and DOWN: two safe. Actually, negation: only UP and DOWN safe, yes two.\nWait, recalculate: After LEFT to (0,7), potential moves:\n  - UP (0,8): Safe, eat apple.\n  - DOWN (0,6): Safe.\n  - LEFT (off board): Dead.\n  - RIGHT (1,7): Into own body (new body pos), dead.\nSo only two safe: UP, DOWN.\nUP first, then from (0,8): LEFT off, RIGHT (1,8), DOWN (0,7 own body? No, body would be (0,7)), DOWN (0,6), UP off.\nNo, after eating.\n\nPerhaps prioritize the LEFT move as planned, even with two follow-ups, since it progresses toward isolated (0,8) safely, avoiding enemy likely south moves. (1,8) effectively limits to two routes.\n\nRight is suicide into own tail.\n\nAll moves except RIGHT safe; LEFT aligns with last plan and keeps options open near board edge but not trapped.\n\nShort-term plan: LEFT to (0,7), then UP to (0,8) to eat apple in 2 moves, extending path easily west-north with good escape (DOWN or RIGHT possible). After eating (head at (0,8), body [(0,7), (1,7), (2,7)] if grown? No, when eat, grow by 1, tail stays. Suppose at (0,7), body [(1,7), (2,7)], eat at (0,8), head to (0,8), body adds new segment at old tail pos (2,7?), rule: body remains, and grows by 1 (no move into apple? Wait, if move onto apple, grow by 1. So head moves, body follows, tail doesn't move, and add one segment at... the snake grows by one at the tail end. So after eating, the tail position stays the same, and new \"tail\" segment is added behind the old tail.\n\nIn implementation, when eating, the snake length increases, new segment at tail.\n\nFor plan: After (0,8), assess board for next apple; likely enemy at south (e.g., if goes DOWN to (3,8)), so if enemy's closer, shift to (9,5) middle-right or others; avoid edges unless necessary.

No immediate threat to my paths, but they could block rights or ups if I advance toward center apples.\n- Apples: (3, 5) is closest reachable via short zigzag (1UP then 1RIGHT, then zigzag up-east); (4, 6) nearby after that; (7, 4) and others farther/more zigzag-heavy. Board has open space up and right\u2014good for maneuvering but watch for enemy tracking column 2 or blocking x=3-4.\n- Risks: RIGHT (3, 3) could lead to simultaneous head-on with enemy (both die, locked in tie or loss if apples equal). Avoid it. Enemy might zigzag right or up-left to compete for center apples, potentially cutting off paths around y=4-6.\n\n### Plan for Next Few Turns\nContinue upward in column 2 with UP to (2, 4), positioning for RIGHT to (3, 4) next turn toward (3, 5) apple\u2014eat it for growth and lead. From (2, 4), prioritize RIGHT if (3, 4) is free and enemy doesn't close in (e.g., if they go RIGHT or UP). If (3, 4) blocked or enemy looms in x=3-4, pivot LEFT to (1, 4) and zigzag up column 1 toward edge apples like (7, 9) or (9, 5), circling back if safer. Keep 2-3 safe exits per turn, evade enemy by staying nimble\u2014aim to eat (3, 5)/(4, 6) before enemy closes gap, using length advantage once grown.\n\nUP",

Safe options: LEFT to (8,8) for exploration/avoiding conflict, or possibly RIGHT but off-grid. UP to (9,9) to eat the apple there. No immediate threat to my position.\n- Apples: (7,9) is directly adjacent (RIGHT move). (9,9) would be next after that. Lower apples like (5,3) are distant (about 7-8 moves away across the board) and not priority yet.\n- Safe moves:\n  - RIGHT: To (7,9) \u2013 eats apple, grows to length 5, gains 1 apple (total 4). Keeps me in high-y row with options (can move RIGHT again to (8,9) or pivot DOWN later).\n  - DOWN: To (6,8) \u2013 safe, opens vertical paths but deviates from row 9 apple row, potentially trapping if enemy pushes upward.\n  - No UP (off-grid), no LEFT (into (5,9), own body \u2013 even though it's not \"backwards into head,\" it's still hitting own body, violates rule).\n- Collision risks: Low.

Enemy head at (8,6), large body in col8-9 descending to row6.\n- Enemy #0: From (8,6), safe moves: LEFT to (7,6) [row6 col7 empty], DOWN to (8,5) [row5 col8 empty]. Likely LEFT to expand/maneuver toward center or pursue apples; DOWN retreats south but keeps mobility open toward (5,3) or board center. He'll probably avoid blocking himself (UP/RIGHT blocked). No immediate threat to my row8 path\u2014his moves don't directly intersect my planned LEFTs, reducing head-on risk.\n- Apples: Prioritize (2,8) as per plan\u2014clear row8 pathway west: no walls, own bodies (my body is east), or enemy blocks until at least col2. Other apples (e.g., (5,3) south, (7,2)/(9,2) row2) are reachable later but farther; no apples in immediate path to steal first.\n- Safe moves:\n  - UP: To (6,9), row9 col6 empty\u2014keeps mobility (row9 opens LEFT/RIGHT to col0-5-.9), but deviates from apple plan (adds turns to loop back to row8 via DOWN/RIGHT), potentially isolating me in row9 if enemy expands. Lower priority as it stalls growth vs. direct LEFT.\n  - LEFT: To (5,8), row8 col5 empty\u2014perfect alignment with plan: advances directly toward (2,8) in 4 LEFTs (turns 40-42), eating apple, growing to length 6, boosting score. Maintains high freedom (3+ escapes west in row8), avoids enemy threats (he's docked at col8-9; even if he LEFTs now, his path doesn't block mine yet). Best for apple pursuit, growth, and options (can pivot DOWN later if row8 pressured).\n  - No DOWN/RIGHT: DOWN hits own body (6,7); RIGHT hits own body (7,8).\n- LEFT wins: Follows proven plan, maximizes safe apple access, keeps board control open (evade enemy expansions LEFT further or DOWN for south apples like (5,3) post-eat). Low collision risk; falls slightly to enemy but prioritizes my growth as per win conditions (apples > aggression).\n\n### Plan for Next Turns\nFrom (5,8) on turn 40: Execute 3 more LEFTs to (2,8) by turn 42 for the apple-grow to 6. Post-eat (head now at (2,8), body extended west), pivot DOWN/LEFT for safety/mobility\u2014avoid row8 west dead-ends if enemy pursues\u2014but prioritize south apples like (5,3) at (5,3) via RIGHT then DOWN loops (e.g., RIGHT to col3-4 row8, then down).

His body blocks much of east/upper board; he moved DOWN last turn likely to (8,5) from (8,6). Safe moves: UP (8,6) near own body, DOWN (8,4) open south, LEFT (7,5) empty, RIGHT (9,5) empty. Probable moves: LEFT or RIGHT to maneuver for apples (e.g., towards (8,3) south) or escape; DOWN retreats further. Unlikely RIGHT into potential trap; could pursue body expansion. His head at (8,5) poses no immediate collision threat\u2014row8 west is clear, and his moves don't intersect my path yet. If he LEFTs aggressively, could approach row8 later, but currently low risk.\n- Apples: Prioritize (2,8)\u2014direct path: 3 LEFTs (to (4,8) this turn, (3,8) next, (2,8) turn 42). Other apples farther: (5,3) south (~6 turns via zigzags), row2 cluster (7,2)/(9,2)/(8,3) (~8+ turns down/left). Eating (2,8) grows me to 6 immediately, shields left flank, keeps options open (pivot DOWN for south apples post-eat). No apples in row9 (UP); (5,3) reachable via DOWN but longer path (lose momentum). Aim to gap-closer his 7 apples; focus on safe multi-apple runs.\n- Safe moves from (5,8):\n  - UP: To (5,9), row9 col5 empty, keeps freedom (3 escapes: LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN), but deviates west plan, stalls apple pursuit (adds 2+ turns to loop back). Low priority\u2014isolates upper board if enemy expands DOWN/LEFT.\n  - DOWN: To (5,7), row7 col5 empty, maintains 3 escapes, allows pivot south to (5,3) or row2 apples (~4-6 turns). Better than UP for future options but abandons (2,8)\u2014opponent leads apples, so delay risks falling behind. Moderate option if enemy threatens row8 west.\n  - LEFT: To (4,8), row8 col4 empty. Perfect for plan: advances to apple in 3.LEFTs (turns 40-42), eats/grows to 6, opens south pivots. Row8 west open (at least col0-4 safe), avoids crowding (own body shifts away); 3 escapes (UP/DOWN/RIGHT in row8).

No win-kill risk; keeps south access for row2/3 apples next.

At distance (5 steps away); likely pursuing south apples (e.g., (5,3) south, or LEFT to (7,3) toward row2 cluster). No immediate threat to my west row\u2014his head takeover can't reach me in 1-2 turns (min 5 steps; he's horizontally balanced but vertical). Safe enemy moves: DOWN to (8,2 empty), LEFT to (7,3 empty near (5,3)/(7,2)), RIGHT to (9,3 empty), UP invalid (own body (8,4)). He'll grow if hitting (5,3) DOWN or pivoting LEFT-DOWN. I lead apples (4 vs 8), but delta is 4; chasing upper cluster early secures parity.\n- Apples: Prioritize (2,8)\u2014adjacent LEFT, zero-risk eat grows me to 6 (5 apples), closes delta to 3. Other apples: (7,2)/(9,2) cluster (eastern row2, ~7-9 turns zigzag east from row8), (5,3) south (~4 turns RIGHT-DOWN hex from row8), (5,6) mid-top (~4 RIGHT-UP then south). Eating (2,8) forces growth now, maintains west mobility for chain (e.g., to south apples post-evade).\n- Safe moves from (3,8):\n  - UP: To (3,9), empty, 3 escapes (L/D/R). Keeps upper evade but isolates from (2,8) (adds looping detours, 2+ extra turns), risks upper sparse traps if enemy pushes west; lower growth priority\u2014stalls apple chase.\n  - DOWN: To (3,7 \ubc1b\uc740), empty, 3 escapes. Mild progress south (closer to (5,3) than stationary), but abandons adjacent growth; moderate if enemy DOWN-onto me (but unlikely\u2014we differ rows/cols). Safer fallback if pivot south urgent, but (2,8) wins short-term.\n  - LEFT: To (2,8), apple! Perfect, confirms plan. Advances directly to eat, grows to 6, gains 5th apple, preserves 3 escapes (post-eat: U (2,9 empty), D (2,7 empty), R (3,8 becomes body, invalid\u2014(3,8) is now behind head, so can't loopback); west open, minimal trap risk (board rows6-9 cols0-3 multipart empty). Enemy can't block fast; ties him to east clusters.\n  - RIGHT: To (4,8), own body (neck segment), invalid\u2014suicidal.\n- LEFT dominates: Executes apple plan, secures easy survival/growth, branches west/down for more eats (target south/row2 clusters after, aiming delta close/lead). No head-ons (enemy stays east), avoids dead-ends. Priorities safety \u2192 apple proximity \u2192 options.\n\n### Plan for Next Turns\nAfter LEFT-eat at (2,8) (grow to 6, tail stays at (6,7), new segment wests).

Likely DOWN to eat east apple cluster\u2014wins potential if not countered, closing 2-3 apple west rivals beats south/close right now. No immediate head-on threat (min 6 turns to reach col2 if DOWN-LEFT pivots, likely loses race).

Likely LEFT to (7,2) this turn for apple cluster (resets lag marginally; embodiments stealth east-nest or spiral up/right away from south-cluster). DOWN to (8,1) opens south-approach but dilutes apple-urgency; no vertical north/chase south yet (min 8 turns to row3-5 apples at current position). Post-LEFT at (8,2) implies east-leaning, diminished south-convergence risk for 3+ turns (board clears col7-8 south/no interference south-drift).\n- Apples: South-central priority - (5,3)(4,5)(5,6) reachable ~3-6 turns zipped (I snag 2-reset 5-7 vs enemy 9-10 delta); (7,2) enemy-proximate (~1 turn eject); (3,9) north-far detour-fatigue (8+ loops UP/R via row7-8 cramped). Chase delta-eat south  (4,5)/(5,6) prioritizes 7-8 apples pre-south-bifurcation (enemy east-eat bolsters apple-divide, thwarts blurs). 7 effective vs 10 marginal 40-turn win-reply.\n- Safe moves from (2,6):\n  - UP: To (2,7), own body - invalid/suicide.\n  - DOWN: To (2,5), empty. 3 escapes (L U R). Guns south-drift to (4,5) row5-zip (~2 turns if unguarded); yanks enemy east-pull (side-lines west-south collision hazard); forestalls north-route fatigue/traps (3 evacuations post-move: L(1,5), U(2,6), R(3,5)); aligns prior plan (frontal commit per enemy LEFT-indicate); bolsters 7-8 apple trajectory.\n  - LEFT: To (1,6), empty. 3 escapes (D U R). West-shunt (stalls south-progression ~6+ detours for (4,5) UP/R danger); cogent enemy-south guard if pivots but overdilutes apple-closure (enemy LEFT-lasts >5 apple-deltas); poorer horizontal trap-risk east-enemy east-repeat.\n  - RIGHT: To (3,6), empty. 3 escapes (D U L). Horiz-addon easts south-apples oblique (~3 turns jagged D/R for (4,5)); symmetrical multimodal (row6 horiz-open/escapes); but north-trap frays south-momentum (5 turns to (5,6) if R/R post-switch); enemy LEFT-advance authenticates little risk (east-pull distances >2 eat-turns). Valid but lateral vs direct south-pull.\n- Decision: DOWN perpetuates south-chase dynamic per rationale (anti-w asymmetric east-enemy; treehouses apple-access; frays north-trap while south darwinizes). Optimizes proximate multi-escape eatureless, avoiding fits livelock. Mirrors last-plan turn45 D-commit for cut-fall 7-8 apples.

Moves east toward (9,4), but (9,4) appears reachable though the path is blocked by enemy body at (8,6), making it less efficient. Also, fewer nearby apples and potential to zig back west.\n\nPrioritizing safety and progress toward multiple apples without closing options too much, UP offers strong flexibility and keeps pathways open to reach (3,9) in ~6 moves (UP-LEFT-LEFT-UP-UP-UP) or adjust. LEFT aligns with zigging west but has marginally fewer immediate options. RIGHT is viable but directs away from your zagging plan toward more foreign/apple-less areas.

LEFT could start the left path but limits future choices slightly more immediately.\n\n**SHORT STRATEGY NOTE:** Zig left next or continue north depending on board, aiming for (3,9) while keeping distance from enemy south and avoiding tight spaces in upper left.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN goes to (7,6), opening bottom space but diverting from the plan and risking unused territory (e.g., near (5,0)) while giving the enemy more room to maneuver left.\n\nEnemy head at (0,6) can only safely go UP (0,7) or RIGHT (1,6). Either direction moves us away from head-on risks, with no immediate convergence toward my planned path.\n\nUpdated plan: Continue RIGHT to (8,7). Assess eating the (9,7) apple by potentially going RIGHT again to (9,7) on the next turn if (9,7) remains unreached by enemy, then DOWN to (9,6) and further to approach (9,4). If enemy pressures left (e.g., UP then RIGHT toward (1,7)), shift toward (5,2) or bottom apples like (5,0). Monitor for traps near x=7-9.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples remain at (5,0) (most direct), (4,3) (reachable in 2 moves via UP then LEFT), (7,1) (distant, hard access due to RIGHT being blocked), (6,5) (farther, in mixed territory), and (6,9) (very far).\n\nPrioritizing: DOWN keeps me on path toward (5,0) in the same column, which is safer with my existing body layout and lower enemy interference risk here (no immediate overlap in column 5 bottom). It maintains 3 future options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) without risking tight spaces. UP opens to eating (4,3) in another move but has only 2 future options (DOWN or LEFT) and potential enemy competition. LEFT moves me toward (4,3) but deviates from the longer-term plan and (4,3) now is equidistant to enemy head (both need ~2 moves, but enemy might pivot elsewhere). DOWN aligns with last rationale's intent to build safe momentum downward, avoiding early isolation.\n\nPlan for next moves: Move DOWN to (5,1) for easy access to (5,0). From there, proceed DOWN to (5,0) next turn to eat and grow, then pivot LEFT to (4,0) for open space and to pursue lower boardside options (avoiding right traps). Monitor enemy for any descent into column 5; if blocked at (5,0), double back RIGHT to (6,0) if clear, or loop to (4,1) for horizontal escapes toward other apples.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT risks enemy contesting (4,3), RIGHT might isolate me toward walls.\n\nLong-term: After eating (5,0), pivot LEFT to (4,0) for open board edge, then assess enemy for upward moves toward (4,3) or (6,5). If enemy stays below, loop right to pursue (7,1) via lower paths. Avoid columns with dense bodies; use edges for hit-and-run escapability.\n\nDOWN",

Safe moves are LEFT to (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0); no immediate collisions or traps.\n\nPrioritizing RIGHT for better future mobility and apple access: from (6,0), opens UP to (6,1) (open, near potential paths) and RIGHT to (7,0) (open, closer to (7,1) apple in next moves via UP from there). LEFT involves left edge (downward limited to off-board), multiple enemy body positions nearby (e.g., nearby x=2, potentially blocking wiggle room), and only one safe follow-up (UP).\n\nLong-term: Execute RIGHT now to shift rightward toward (7,1) apple via (6,0)->RIGHT (7,0)->UP. This avoids crowding left (enemy at x=2-3 area) and keeps right-edge open space for escapes/loops. Monitor enemy head at (4,3)\u2014if they push left, loop right/top toward (6,5); if they stay center, rush (7,1) then pivot.\n\nRIGHT",

Opens paths to eat the nearby (7,1) apple on the next move via UP, or RIGHT to (8,0) for more open space. Keeps multiple safe follow-ups (UP and RIGHT) and avoids tightness, aligning with prioritizing apple access and escape routes. Enemy snake (#0) at (5,3) is distant for now, but RIGHT shifts me rightward, away from their body cluster, reducing collision risk this turn.\n\nLong-term: Post-apple at (7,1), loop upward/right toward (6,5) apple if enemy pushes left/center; otherwise, pivot toward (2,1) or (1,9). Avoid east edge if it tightens.\n\nRIGHT",
