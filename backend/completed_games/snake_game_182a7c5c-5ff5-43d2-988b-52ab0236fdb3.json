Moving to (7,2) would require a detour.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,2): no apple there, and it would move us away from immediate goals.\n- Given the safety, proximity, and the fact that the apple at (8,1) is directly below us, moving DOWN seems optimal.\n- Moving down also keeps us safe from walls and enemy snakes: (8,1) is free, no immediate danger.\n\nNext, consider future moves:\n- After moving down, we will be at (8,1), where an apple exists. Eating it will grow our snake and bring us closer to other apples.\n- On the next turn, we can plan to navigate towards other apples, perhaps focusing on (7,2) or (4,7).\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move now is to move DOWN to eat the apple at (8,1).\n\n**Next move: DOWN**"
