This suggests that my snake head is actually at (7,9) and there was no apple collected on the last move.

Their most likely moves would be UP to (3,7) or RIGHT to (4,6).\n\n4. **Board control**: Moving LEFT toward (6,9) would move me into my own body at (6,9), which is a death move. Moving RIGHT to (8,9) is safe but moves me away from the nearest apple at (3,9). Moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe and keeps me in a good position to potentially move toward the apple at (7,3).\n\n5. **Future pathing**: From (7,8), I could continue DOWN to (7,7), (7,6), etc. to reach the apple at (7,3). The path to (3,9) is more complex as it requires moving left through 4 columns.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (7,8) to position myself to reach the apple at (7,3) on subsequent moves.

They could move UP to (3,10) (which is off the board), DOWN to (3,8), LEFT to (2,9), or RIGHT to (4,9). Their most likely moves would be DOWN to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,9).\n\n2. **Apple opportunities**: \n   - The apple at (4,9) is directly above and to the right of me - I could reach it by moving UP to (5,9) then RIGHT to (6,9)\n   - The apple at (7,3) is directly below me - I could reach it by moving DOWN repeatedly\n   - The apple at (6,3) is below and slightly right\n   - The apple at (2,4) is in the middle-left area\n   - The apple at (3,1) is in the bottom-left area\n\n3. **Board control**: Moving UP to (5,9) positions me to potentially move toward the apple at (4,9) while maintaining distance from the enemy. Moving DOWN to (5,7) keeps me in position to reach the apple at (7,3). Moving LEFT to (4,8) moves me toward the left side where multiple apples are located.\n\n4. **Future pathing**: From (5,9), I could move UP to (5,10) (off the board), DOWN to (5,8), LEFT to (4,9), or RIGHT to (6,9). This gives me flexibility to move toward the apple at (4,9) or continue to explore other options. From (5,7), I could move UP to (5,8), LEFT to (4,7), or DOWN to (5,6). From (4,8), I could move UP to (4,9), LEFT to (3,8), or DOWN to (4,7).\n\n5. **Avoiding head-on collisions**: The enemy snake is at (3,9), so moving UP or RIGHT reduces the chance of a head-on collision compared to moving LEFT (which would move me closer to the enemy).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to (5,9) to position myself to reach the apple at (4,9) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. This keeps my options open and moves me closer to a reachable apple. I should continue to move right and up to reach the apple at (4,9) while avoiding the enemy snake's path.\n\nUP",
