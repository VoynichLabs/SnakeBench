Off-board: none of these moves go off the 10x10 grid.  \n2. Into my own body: I have no body yet, so no risk.  \n3. Into enemy body: enemy has no body yet.  \n4. Into enemy head: enemy head is at (7, 4), not where I\u2019m moving this turn unless they move into me simultaneously.  \n5. Head-on collision: If enemy moves into the same cell I move into, both die. So I should avoid moving to where enemy might move.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (7, 4):**  \nUP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4).  \n\n**Check each of my moves for head-on collision risk:**  \n- UP to (5,4): enemy could move LEFT to (6,4) \u2014 not same cell. Safe.  \n- DOWN to (5,2): enemy can\u2019t reach (5,2) in one move. Safe.  \n- LEFT to (4,3): enemy can\u2019t reach (4,3) in one move. Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (6,3): enemy could move DOWN to (7,3) \u2014 not same cell. Safe.  \n\nSo all four moves are immediately safe from self-kill and head-on collision (since enemy can\u2019t reach same cell I move to in one move except if I move to (6,4) or (7,3) or (7,5) or (8,4), none of which I\u2019m moving to).  \n\n**Apple positions:** (7,9), (4,6), (6,1), (2,4), (8,5)  \n\nClosest apples by Manhattan distance from (5,3):  \n- (6,1): distance |6-5|+|1-3| = 1+2=3  \n- (2,4): |2-5|+|4-3| = 3+1=4  \n- (4,6): |4-5|+|6-3| = 1+3=4  \n- (8,5): 3+2=5  \n- (7,9): 2+6=8  \n\nClosest is (6,1) at distance 3.  \n\n**Which move gets me closer to (6,1)?**  \nFrom (5,3):  \n- UP to (5,4): distance to (6,1) = 1+3=4 (worse)  \n- DOWN to (5,2): distance = 1+1=2 (better)  \n- LEFT to (4,3): distance = 2+2=4 (worse)  \n- RIGHT to (6,3): distance = 0+2=2 (better)  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both reduce distance to 2.  \n\n**Future safety considerations:**  \n- DOWN to (5,2): leaves me near apple (6,1) next turn, but also near enemy? Enemy at (7,4) is far.  \n- RIGHT to (6,3): puts me closer to center, more open options.  \n\nBut apple at (6,1) is below-right from (5,3). DOWN gets me directly toward it in y-axis, RIGHT gets me closer in x-axis.  \n\nLet\u2019s check if moving RIGHT puts me in danger of enemy next turn:  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,3), enemy possible moves: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4).  \nEnemy could move LEFT to (6,4) \u2014 adjacent vertically to my new head (6,3) \u2014 that\u2019s not same cell, so no immediate death, but next turn we could collide if I move up.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,2), enemy moves don\u2019t get near me quickly.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to collect apples while avoiding enemy. Enemy is at (7,4), I\u2019m at (5,3). Keeping distance is wise early on. Apple at (6,1) is safe from enemy currently. Let\u2019s go for it.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN gets me to (5,2), closer to apple (6,1) and away from enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

This secures a clear path to the (0, 0) apple while keeping me alive. The enemy is focused on the central apples, so I can grab the corner apple uncontested and maintain my lead. It also keeps me away from potential head-on collisions with the enemy.\n\n**Strategy note for future turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN, continue toward (0, 0) to secure that apple.

However, eating apple is valuable to keep pace with enemy.  \n\n**Strategic plan for next turns:**  \nEat apple at (3,8) now.

Consider moving DOWN toward (6,3) or (4,0) to collect more apples while keeping distance from enemy. Enemy is on left side, so moving DOWN or LEFT (if safe) may be good.

Need to check enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) \u2013 free.\n\nSo immediately invalid: UP. LEFT risky if enemy stays. DOWN and RIGHT are safe unless enemy moves into them.\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (2,7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2,8) \u2013 free.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 its own body, invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) \u2013 my head currently there; if I move away, it\u2019s free for enemy.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,7) and enemy stays (RIGHT into my old head (3,7)), no collision. But if enemy stays (chooses DOWN? invalid) or UP/LEFT, then (2,7) empty and I move in\u2014no head-on unless enemy also goes LEFT into (1,7). Actually if enemy goes LEFT to (1,7) and I go LEFT to (2,7), no collision. If enemy goes RIGHT to (3,7) and I go LEFT to (2,7), no collision. If enemy stays (impossible, must move), so no simultaneous same-cell risk at (2,7) unless enemy chooses RIGHT? Wait, enemy\u2019s RIGHT is (3,7), not (2,7). So (2,7) is safe from enemy head this turn. However, enemy\u2019s body includes (2,6) but not (2,7) now (enemy head was at (2,7) last turn, so after moving, (2,7) becomes body? Actually after enemy moves, its old head becomes body segment immediately. So if enemy moves away, (2,7) becomes part of its body this turn\u2014meaning if I move into (2,7) after enemy left, I die. So LEFT is unsafe because enemy will vacate (2,7) and it becomes enemy body cell before I occupy it? Let\u2019s check rules: all heads move simultaneously, then growth/apple checks. So at the moment heads move, enemy\u2019s head is no longer at (2,7) if it moved. But its body from last turn includes (2,6), (1,6), etc., not (2,7) until after movement? Wait: last turn enemy head was at (2,6) (from previous info) and moved to (2,7) last turn? Actually last turn enemy head was at (2,6) and I moved DOWN. Then enemy moved to (2,7) (since board now shows enemy head at (2,7)). So enemy\u2019s body from last turn includes (2,6) as first body segment. This turn, enemy moves from (2,7) to somewhere. After moving, its old head (2,7) becomes new body segment (since it grew earlier? It ate an apple at (2,7) maybe, so length increased by 1, so after moving, the old head becomes a new body segment, and tail stays). So at the time I move, enemy\u2019s body includes (2,6) and older segments, but not (2,7) yet. After movement, (2,7) becomes enemy body if enemy grew earlier. But movement is simultaneous: I move into (2,7) at same time enemy moves out of (2,7). The rule: if your head moves into any snake\u2019s body (including your own), you die. At the start of the turn, (2,7) is enemy head, not body. After movement, if enemy left (2,7), that cell becomes enemy body (if it grew earlier) or becomes empty (if no growth). Since enemy grew last turn (it ate apple at (2,7)?), then after moving this turn, (2,7) becomes a new body segment. So at the instant I move into (2,7), is it considered enemy body? The game processes collisions after all heads have moved. So after heads have moved, (2,7) contains my head and also enemy\u2019s new body segment (since enemy grew). That means I die. So LEFT is unsafe.  \n\nThus safe moves: DOWN (3,6) and RIGHT (4,7).  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (6,3) is 3 steps away (Manhattan distance from (3,7): |3-6|+|7-3|=3+4=7? Wait, that\u2019s wrong: |3-6|=3, |7-3|=4, total 7). Actually (6,3) is 7 steps. (9,5) is 6 steps, (8,1) is 7 steps, (4,0) is 8 steps, (5,0) is 8 steps.  \nFrom (3,7), DOWN gets me closer to (6,3) and (8,1). RIGHT gets me closer to (9,5) but also toward my body along top-right.  \n\n**Future mobility:**  \n- DOWN to (3,6): next turn from (3,6): UP (3,7) free? (3,7) will be empty after I move. DOWN (3,5) free, LEFT (2,6) enemy body (occupied), RIGHT (4,6) free \u2192 3 safe moves likely.  \n- RIGHT to (4,7): next turn from (4,7): UP (4,8) my body, DOWN (4,6) free, LEFT (3,7) free, RIGHT (5,7) free \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nBoth similar.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (2,7) can go UP (2,8), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). If I go DOWN to (3,6), enemy\u2019s RIGHT (3,7) is where my head was, safe. If I go RIGHT to (4,7), enemy\u2019s RIGHT (3,7) is empty. No direct collision.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need apples to catch up (8 vs 10). Best cluster is bottom-left: (4,0),(5,0). Also (6,3) is near. I should work my way down-left while avoiding enemy who is on left side. My body blocks top-right area, so I have space below and left.  \n\n**This turn:** DOWN moves toward apples and away from enemy. RIGHT moves toward my body and limits future space.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Eating apple means I grow, so tail stays, body extends: new head at (6,3), body becomes [(6,3),(5,3),(4,3),...,(4,8)] length 10.  \n\nUP to (5,4): safe, but moves away from closest apple.  \nDOWN to (5,2): safe, moves toward (4,0)/(5,0).  \n\n**Future mobility after RIGHT (eating apple):**  \nFrom (6,3) next turn:  \n- UP (6,4) free  \n- DOWN (6,2) free  \n- LEFT (5,3) free (was my previous head, now body)  \n- RIGHT (7,3) free  \nAll four moves safe unless enemy moves into them. Good mobility.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy could go RIGHT to (1,3), still far. No overlap.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat (6,3) now, then go DOWN toward (4,0)/(5,0) next turn. Enemy is longer but stuck near left wall; I can stay central and keep collecting apples efficiently. Avoid trapping myself in corners.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

I should move RIGHT now to gain better positioning for reaching the apples.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move RIGHT to escape the left wall, then make my way toward apples at (3, 1) or (4, 0)/(5, 0). Once my body clears the positions above me, I'll have even more space to maneuver.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy may go for (4,6) or (3,8). If enemy goes UP to (4,6), it eats apple and grows to 14.  \n\nAfter eating (8,9), I\u2019ll be at (8,9) with only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn. That\u2019s risky but manageable if I plan escape route toward (9,5) or center.  \n\nLEFT avoids immediate risk but delays apple, letting enemy possibly get further ahead.  \n\nGiven I need to catch up, taking apple now is better.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nThis turn: RIGHT to (8,9) eat apple.  \nNext turn from (8,9): choose between DOWN (8,8) or RIGHT (9,9) based on enemy position.

After this move (head to (9,4)), tail moves from (8,3) to (8,4)? Wait: snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, last segment (tail) is removed unless apple eaten.  \nI just ate apple last turn, so length increased by 1: new tail is old tail (8,3) stays, new segment added at head after move. Actually: after eating, tail doesn\u2019t move that turn. So after last turn (head to (9,5)), tail stayed at (8,3). This turn (head to (9,4)), tail will move from (8,3) to (8,4) (since no apple eaten this turn). So at end of this turn, tail at (8,4), body includes (8,3)? Let\u2019s trace:  \n\nCurrent body before this move:  \nHead (9,5), then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) tail.  \n\nAfter moving DOWN to (9,4):  \nNew head (9,4), old head (9,5) becomes segment 2, then (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3) tail. Then tail moves: last segment (8,3) removed, new tail is (8,4)? Wait, shifting: each segment moves forward except head. Actually:  \nNew body: head (9,4), then old head (9,5), then old segment 2 (9,6), \u2026 up to old second-to-last (8,4) becomes new last segment. Old tail (8,3) disappears.  \nSo after this move, tail will be at (8,4).  \n\nThus at next turn from (9,4) moving DOWN to (9,3):  \nThen body will be: head (9,3), then (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), \u2026 up to (8,5) tail? Let\u2019s not overcomplicate.  \n\nKey point: at (9,3), LEFT is (8,3) which will be free if tail has moved away. But tail will be at (8,4) after this turn, so (8,3) free next turn. That gives an escape off the right edge!  \n\nSo plan:  \nThis turn: DOWN to (9,4).  \nNext turn: from (9,4) only DOWN to (9,3).  \nTurn after: from (9,3): UP (9,4) body, DOWN (9,2) free, LEFT (8,3) free, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 safe moves. Then go LEFT toward center/apples.  \n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy may go for (1,6) or (3,4) apples. It\u2019s longer, but I need to survive and catch up.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, my body will move:  \nMy tail is at (8,5) \u2192 after moving head to (9,2), tail moves forward, so (9,3) becomes empty (since my body was (9,3) head, (9,4) second segment, etc.). Actually, check: current body: head (9,3), then (9,4), (9,5), ..., (8,5). After moving, new head at (9,2), body becomes [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4), ..., (7,5)? Let's trace: length 14, so tail (8,5) will stay if I don't eat apple. Actually, if no apple eaten, snake moves: head to new cell, each segment moves into previous segment's position, tail cell vacated. So (9,3) becomes my second segment, not free. So from (9,2) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (9,3) \u2013 my body, invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,1) \u2013 free (board shows '.' at (9,1) row 1 col 9).  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,2) \u2013 free (board shows '.' at (8,2) row 2 col 8).  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board, invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,3):  \nNext turn from (8,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,4) \u2013 my body? Let's see: after moving LEFT, body: [(8,3), (9,3), (9,4), ..., (8,5)? Actually, second segment becomes old head (9,3), third becomes (9,4), tail (8,5) vacates. So (8,4) is currently my body segment? Check current body: (9,4) is second segment, so after move, (9,4) becomes third segment, (8,4) is free now? Wait, (8,4) is not in my current body list. Yes, current body has (9,4), (9,5), ..., (8,5). (8,4) is free now. So (8,4) will be free next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,2) \u2013 free.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,3) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,3) \u2013 my body (second segment), invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if I go LEFT now.  \n\nLEFT gives better future mobility.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to (8,3) is (6,1) (Manhattan distance 4). From (9,2) also closest is (6,1) (distance 5). So LEFT slightly closer.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is longer, but far away. I need to collect apples safely.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nGo LEFT to (8,3) for better options next turn. Then from (8,3), likely go DOWN to (8,2) toward apple (6,1).  \n\nLEFT",

My tail is at (7,5) now. After moving, body shifts: head to (8,4), second segment (8,3), third (9,3), etc. (8,5) is free now and will stay free next turn unless enemy moves there. So UP from (8,4) next turn is free.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 my second segment next turn, invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) \u2013 my third segment next turn, invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn if I go UP now.  \n\nFrom (8,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 my second segment next turn, invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1) \u2013 free.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2) \u2013 free.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nFrom (7,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 free.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 free.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 my second segment next turn, invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if I go LEFT now.  \n\nDOWN and LEFT give better future mobility than UP.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to (8,3) is (6,1) distance 4 (Manhattan).  \n- DOWN to (8,2) \u2192 distance to (6,1) = 3.  \n- LEFT to (7,3) \u2192 distance to (6,1) = 4.  \n- UP to (8,4) \u2192 distance to nearest apple (3,4) = 5.  \n\nDOWN gets me closer to (6,1) and keeps good options.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is longer but far. It might go for (1,4) apple this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nFrom (8,2), I can go LEFT toward (6,1) or DOWN to (8,1) then LEFT.

(free). Not in my body list.  \n- DOWN to (7,0): '.' free.  \n- LEFT to (6,1): Apple at (6,1) \u2014 not in my body.  \n- RIGHT to (8,1): That\u2019s my body\u2019s first segment (from last turn\u2019s body list, now at (8,1) after my move LEFT last turn). So RIGHT is suicide.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (6,1) is 1 step LEFT. (2,1) is 5 steps away, (3,2) is 4 steps, (5,2) is 3 steps, (0,3) far.  \nLEFT goes directly onto apple (6,1).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- LEFT to (6,1) (eat apple):  \n  Next turn from (6,1):  \n  UP (6,2) \u2013 free (board shows '.'),  \n  DOWN (6,0) \u2013 free,  \n  LEFT (5,1) \u2013 free ('.'),  \n  RIGHT (7,1) \u2013 will be my second segment after moving (currently at (8,1) will shift forward, so (7,1) becomes my neck? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n    After eating apple, my new body: head (6,1), then old head (7,1) becomes segment 2, then (8,1), (8,2), \u2026 So (7,1) is my second segment next turn, so RIGHT from (6,1) is invalid.  \n  So 3 safe moves next turn after LEFT.  \n\n- UP to (7,2):  \n  Next turn from (7,2):  \n  UP (7,3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  DOWN (7,1) \u2013 will be my second segment (invalid),  \n  LEFT (6,2) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  RIGHT (8,2) \u2013 my body (currently at (8,2) will shift to (8,3)? Let\u2019s simulate: If I move UP to (7,2), body becomes: head (7,2), then old head (7,1) becomes segment 2, then (8,1), (8,2), \u2026 Wait, (8,2) is in the old body list as segment 3? Actually current body: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), \u2026 After moving UP to (7,2), the old head (7,1) becomes segment 2, old segment 1 (8,1) becomes segment 3, old segment 2 (8,2) becomes segment 4 at (8,2) still? No, shift: all body segments move forward: segment 1 (8,1) moves to (7,1), segment 2 (8,2) stays at (8,2)? That\u2019s wrong \u2014 in Snake, each segment moves into the previous segment\u2019s position. So:  \n  New body: head (7,2), then (7,1), then (8,1), then (8,2), then (8,3), \u2026 So (8,2) is segment 4, not adjacent to head at (7,2). So RIGHT (8,2) is safe.  \n  Let\u2019s check carefully: current body: [(8,1), (8,2), (8,3), \u2026]. After UP to (7,2):  \n  Head: (7,2)  \n  Segment 2: old head (7,1)  \n  Segment 3: old segment 1 (8,1)  \n  Segment 4: old segment 2 (8,2)  \n  So from (7,2), RIGHT is (8,2) which is segment 4 \u2014 safe. DOWN is (7,1) segment 2 \u2014 unsafe.  \n  So safe moves from (7,2) next turn: UP (7,3), LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2). That\u2019s 3 safe moves.  \n\n- DOWN to (7,0):  \n  Next turn from (7,0):  \n  UP (7,1) \u2013 segment 2 (invalid),  \n  DOWN off board,  \n  LEFT (6,0) \u2013 free,  \n  RIGHT (8,0) \u2013 free.  \n  So only 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo DOWN is worst for future mobility.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (3,4). It could move toward apples (3,2) or (2,1) or (5,2). Distance to me: 5 cells. No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Eating apple now vs later:**  \nEating apple now grows me to length 15 (14 apples + 1 base). Enemy length 20. Still behind, but need to catch up.  \nIf I go LEFT to (6,1), I eat apple and open up future moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of trapping later:**  \nAfter eating at (6,1), my body extends: tail end is at (7,8) currently, will shift to (7,7) next turn. So left side board is relatively open except enemy might come down.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Consider avoiding apple now to stay shorter for maneuver?**  \nNo, I need apples to compete. Enemy has 19, I have 13. Must eat apples faster.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turn after eating apple:**  \nFrom (6,1) after eating, safe moves: UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1).  \nI could go UP toward (5,2) apple next, or LEFT toward (2,1) apple later.  \n\nLEFT seems best: gets apple now, good future options.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (6,1), consider going UP to (6,2) to approach (5,2) apple, unless enemy blocks. Keep enemy\u2019s longer length in mind \u2014 avoid head-to-head.  \n\nLEFT",

(free). Not in my body list.  \n- DOWN to (6, 0): '.' free.  \n- LEFT to (5, 1): '.' free.  \n- RIGHT to (7, 1): That\u2019s my second segment (currently at (7, 1) after last move) \u2014 unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (5, 2) is 2 steps away (UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP).  \n- (2, 1) is 4 steps away.  \n- (3, 2) is 3 steps away.  \n- (0, 3) and (0, 9) are far.  \n\nUP gets me closer to (5, 2).  \nLEFT gets me closer to (2, 1) and (3, 2) but not directly.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (6, 2):  \n  Next turn from (6, 2):  \n  UP (6, 3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  DOWN (6, 1) \u2013 will be my second segment (unsafe),  \n  LEFT (5, 2) \u2013 apple there, free,  \n  RIGHT (7, 2) \u2013 '.' free.  \n  So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n- DOWN to (6, 0):  \n  Next turn from (6, 0):  \n  UP (6, 1) \u2013 segment 2 (unsafe),  \n  DOWN off board,  \n  LEFT (5, 0) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  RIGHT (7, 0) \u2013 '.' free.  \n  So 2 safe moves. Worse mobility.  \n\n- LEFT to (5, 1):  \n  Next turn from (5, 1):  \n  UP (5, 2) \u2013 apple, free,  \n  DOWN (5, 0) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  LEFT (4, 1) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  RIGHT (6, 1) \u2013 segment 2 (unsafe).  \n  So 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo DOWN is worst for mobility.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 3). It could move toward (3, 2) apple or (2, 1) or (5, 2).  \nDistance from enemy to (5, 2) is 3 steps. Distance from me to (5, 2) is 2 steps.  \nIf I go UP now to (6, 2), next turn I can go LEFT to (5, 2) and eat it before enemy possibly gets there.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (5, 1), next turn I can go UP to (5, 2) \u2014 same timing.  \n\nBut enemy might also move toward (3, 2) apple first, which is closer to them.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision:**  \nFrom (3, 3), enemy could move DOWN to (3, 2) (apple), LEFT to (2, 3), UP to (3, 4), RIGHT to (4, 3).  \nNone of those directly intersect my possible moves this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nMy body occupies right side (columns 7\u20139). Going LEFT opens more space.  \nGoing UP then LEFT keeps me near center where apples are.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \nGoal: eat (5, 2) and (3, 2) if possible, avoid enemy head-on since they are longer.  \nAfter eating (5, 2), consider moving toward (3, 2) if enemy hasn\u2019t taken it.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP and LEFT both give good future options.  \nUP puts me at (6, 2), next turn I can eat (5, 2) unless enemy moves there this turn (they can\u2019t reach it in 1 move from (3, 3)).  \nLEFT puts me at (5, 1), next turn I can eat (5, 2) as well.  \nBut UP gives slightly better central position and keeps distance from my body on right.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP to approach (5, 2) directly next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 2), if (5, 2) apple still there, go LEFT to eat it unless enemy head is adjacent. Then aim for (3, 2) or (2, 1) depending on enemy movement.  \n\nUP",

(free). Not in my body list.  \n- DOWN to (6, 1): That\u2019s my second segment (6, 1) \u2014 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (5, 2): Apple there, free (not in my body).  \n- RIGHT to (7, 2): '.' free.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (5, 2) is 1 step LEFT.  \n- (1, 2) is 5 steps away.  \n- (2, 1) is 5 steps away.  \n- (0, 3) and (0, 9) far.  \n\nLEFT directly eats (5, 2).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- LEFT to (5, 2) \u2013 eat apple, grow by 1:  \n  Next turn from (5, 2):  \n  UP (5, 3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  DOWN (5, 1) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  LEFT (4, 2) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  RIGHT (6, 2) \u2013 will be my second segment (unsafe).  \n  So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- UP to (6, 3):  \n  Next turn from (6, 3):  \n  UP (6, 4) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  DOWN (6, 2) \u2013 segment 2 (unsafe),  \n  LEFT (5, 3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  RIGHT (7, 3) \u2013 '.' free.  \n  So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- RIGHT to (7, 2):  \n  Next turn from (7, 2):  \n  UP (7, 3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n  DOWN (7, 1) \u2013 segment 3 (unsafe),  \n  LEFT (6, 2) \u2013 segment 2 (unsafe),  \n  RIGHT (8, 2) \u2013 segment 4 (unsafe).  \n  So only 1 safe move (UP) \u2014 very risky.  \n\nSo RIGHT is bad for mobility.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 2).  \nFrom (3, 2), enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP to (3, 3) \u2013 '.' free,  \n- DOWN to (3, 1) \u2013 '.' free,  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) \u2013 '.' free,  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2013 '.' free.  \n\nEnemy could move RIGHT to (4, 2) this turn, which is 1 step from (5, 2).  \nIf I go LEFT to (5, 2) now, enemy could move to (4, 2) and next turn be adjacent to me at (5, 2) \u2014 but since I\u2019d be eating apple this turn, next turn my head is at (5, 2) and my second segment at (6, 2). Enemy could move into (5, 2) next turn only if I leave it, but I\u2019ll be there. So head-on collision possible next turn if enemy moves into my head cell.  \n\nBut: If enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 2) this turn, then next turn from (4, 2) they could move RIGHT to (5, 2) while I\u2019m still at (5, 2) \u2014 that\u2019s a head-on collision and both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nIf enemy moves elsewhere this turn, no immediate head-on risk next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of immediate head-on this turn?**  \nMy LEFT to (5, 2) vs enemy possible moves: enemy could move RIGHT to (4, 2) or DOWN/UP/LEFT. No direct head-on this turn because enemy starts at (3, 2) and I end at (5, 2), not same cell.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative: avoid (5, 2) this turn?**  \nIf I go UP to (6, 3), enemy might eat (5, 2) this turn if they move RIGHT then DOWN? Wait, enemy at (3, 2) can\u2019t reach (5, 2) in 1 move. So (5, 2) will remain next turn unless enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 2) and I don\u2019t eat it now.  \n\nBut if enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 2) this turn, then next turn they can eat (5, 2) before me if I\u2019m not already there.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nEating (5, 2) now gives me +1 apple (15 total), grows length, and puts me closer to other apples. Risk is next-turn head-on if enemy moves to (4, 2) now and then to (5, 2) next turn while I\u2019m there.  \n\nBut if enemy moves to (4, 2) this turn, I can see that next turn and avoid staying at (5, 2) by moving UP/DOWN/LEFT from (5, 2) to avoid collision.  \n\nActually, if enemy is at (4, 2) next to me at (5, 2), moving UP/DOWN/LEFT from (5, 2) are all safe except possibly into enemy\u2019s future move \u2014 but we move simultaneously, so if I move LEFT to (4, 2) while enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 2), we swap and no collision. If we both move LEFT from our positions, I go to (4, 2) and enemy goes to (3, 2) \u2014 fine. So I can avoid dying next turn by choosing a move that doesn\u2019t land on enemy\u2019s head.  \n\nThus eating apple now is beneficial.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose LEFT to eat (5, 2).**  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 2), check enemy head position. If enemy at (4, 2), avoid moving RIGHT (into them) and avoid staying still if they might move into me. Prefer UP to (5, 3) or DOWN to (5, 1) to stay safe and target (1, 2) or (2, 1) apples.  \n\nLEFT",

UP (5,4) free, DOWN (5,2) unsafe (my body), LEFT (4,3) free, RIGHT (6,3) free \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (5,1) DOWN:  \n  Next turn safe moves? UP (5,2) unsafe, DOWN (5,0) free, LEFT (4,1) free, RIGHT (6,1) unsafe (my body) \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (4,2) LEFT:  \n  Next turn safe moves? UP (4,3) free, DOWN (4,1) free, LEFT (3,2) \u2014 if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,2) this turn, that\u2019s enemy head next turn \u2192 unsafe. So if enemy at (3,2) next turn, only 2 safe moves from (4,2). If enemy not at (3,2), then LEFT to (3,2) is free \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of immediate head-on this turn?**  \nNo, enemy at (2,2) can\u2019t reach my target cells (5,3), (5,1), (4,2) in one move.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nEnemy is likely to go for apples at (2,1) or (1,2) this turn.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (2,1), they\u2019ll be at (2,1) next turn, not near me if I\u2019m at (4,2) or (5,1).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1,2), same.  \n\nBut if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,2), they might be trying to cut me off from apples.  \n\nChoosing DOWN to (5,1) keeps me safe from immediate adjacency, moves toward apples (3,1) and (2,1), and gives reasonable mobility next turn.  \n\nLEFT to (4,2) risks adjacency if enemy moves RIGHT, but gets me closer to apples faster.  \n\nGiven enemy length is 20 vs my 16, I should avoid risky adjacency unless necessary.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,1), if enemy at (2,1) or (1,2), I can move LEFT toward (3,1) apple. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible next moves to avoid head-on.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose DOWN to (5,1).**  \n\nDOWN",
