But that seems reversed or inconsistent.\n\nEarlier you had:\n\n- Head at (1,6)\n\n- Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]\n\nThat seems confusing because (1,6) is head, but it's also in body? Usually, body excludes head.\n\nConventionally, snake body is just body segments, excluding head.\n\nSo I will consider:\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] (tail at (1,4))\n\nYou moved DOWN to (1,5), so the new head is (1,5).\n\nBecause you ate an apple, the tail does not move, so your body segments shift:\n\nAssuming growth:\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- Body now: (1,6), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)?

It's dangerous, probably a snake body part. Avoid.\n\n- RIGHT: (2,5) \u2014 is (2,5) free?\n\n(2,5) is an apple spot. So if we go RIGHT, we can take the apple at (2,5).\n\nIs it safe?

Usually, body excludes head.\n\nConventionally, snake body is just body segments, excluding head.\n\nSo I will consider:\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] (tail at (1,4))\n\nYou moved DOWN to (1,5), so the new head is (1,5).\n\nBecause you ate an apple, the tail does not move, so your body segments shift:\n\nAssuming growth:\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- Body now: (1,6), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)?
