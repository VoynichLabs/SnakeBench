Available Moves from (6,7):\n\n- **LEFT** to (5,7) \u2014 clear\n- **RIGHT** to (7,7) \u2014 this is my own body (from last move). This would kill me.\n- **UP** to (6,8) \u2014 clear\n- **DOWN** to (6,6) \u2014 clear\n\n**So: cannot move RIGHT (own body, immediate death).**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Which apples are nearest now?\n\n- Let's Manhattan distance from (6,7):\n\n    - (8,2): |8-6| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = **7**\n    - (1,2): |1-6| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = **10**\n    - (7,0): |7-6| + |0-7| = 1 + 7 = **8**\n    - (4,4): |4-6| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = **5**\n    - (9,5): |9-6| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = **5**\n\nSo, there are two \"closest\" apples at distance 5: **(4,4)** and **(9,5)**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Apple Pathing and Position Strategy\n\n- **LEFT (5,7):** points me toward (4,4).\n- **UP (6,8):** doesn't really take me closer to apples; the apples are all down or right/left.\n- **DOWN (6,6):** not directly toward any apple, but a flexible open move.\n- **RIGHT (7,7):** my own body, instant death.\n\n### Consider enemy: \n- Enemy snake is at (1,5), which is much closer to (1,2) than to any of \"my\" apples. I am not at risk of a race for apples this turn.\n\n### Path choices:\n- **Toward (4,4):** I can proceed LEFT\u2192LEFT\u2192DOWN\u2192DOWN, or something similar.\n- **Toward (9,5):** could go RIGHT(except that's blocked by my own body: can't do at this instant), so maybe UP then over and down.\n\nBut **RIGHT** is not available this turn (blocked by my own body). \nIf I go UP, then next turn I can choose to go RIGHT toward (9,5).\n\n- **LEFT**: Heads toward (4,4) (best combination of directness and open space).\n- **UP**: Prepares for a potential push toward (9,5).\n- **DOWN**: Feels \"aimless\" \u2014 not clearly toward either apple, unless we want to stall.\n\nChecking board edges:\n- At (6,7), I'm nowhere near a wall in any direction (safe).\n\nNo other snakes nearby.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Avoiding body trap:\nAfter moving LEFT, my head will be at (5,7), body would trail: (6,7), (7,7).\nNo way to trap myself soon.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Which apple first?\nBoth (4,4) and (9,5) are 5 steps away.\n- (4,4): going LEFT now starts that path directly.\n- (9,5): would need to go UP now, then RIGHT, etc.\nPreference: LEFT is closer to the board center, safer for future maneuvering, and keeps more options open. Also, the apple at (9,5) is at the edge; less escape routes if another snake comes.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final Plan\n\n- **Move:** LEFT to (5,7)  \n  - This begins the shortest path toward (4,4), is safest, and remains flexible for next turn.\n  - Observe enemy's movement and respawn locations of apples.\n  - Next turn: continue toward (4,4) unless situation changes.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy Note:**  \nKeep pushing for the apple at (4,4) while maintaining safe distance from your own body. Monitor enemy for sudden direction toward the central apples in future turns. After (4,4), new apple priorities may emerge. Stay near the center for maximum options.\n\n---\n\n**My Move:**  \n**LEFT**"

Likely (2,3).\n- If enemy draws near center or an apple disappears, replan.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision\n\n**Move:** **DOWN**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy Note:**  \nIf the apple at (4,4) is gone or blocked next turn, consider moving towards (2,3).
