This direction also keeps many open squares around us for future maneuvering and does not trap us against any wall or the enemy.\n\nTherefore the safest and most advantageous move is to go LEFT.  \nLEFT",

That cell is adjacent to several of our own body segments, leaving only a single safe continuation (DOWN), which quickly leads to a dead\u2011end corridor.  \n\nConsidering apple proximity, future flexibility, and collision risk, moving DOWN is the best choice.  \n\nPlan: Continue heading down toward the (8,2) apple while staying aware of the enemy snake; keep options open by not committing to the edge; avoid any move that would place the head onto our own body or into a position with limited escape routes.  \n\nDOWN",
