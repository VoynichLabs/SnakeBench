UP is illegal. LEFT and DOWN are both safe; I prefer DOWN because it moves away from the nearby enemy head, preserves flexibility, and still allows a route later toward (2,5) or other apples while avoiding the concentrated enemy body around x=7.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN now to (3,7) to create distance.\n- From there, head west/down toward (2,5) or loop to collect other apples while avoiding the x=7 corridor occupied by the opponent.\n- Maintain escape options and avoid head-on contests for apples close to the enemy (e.g., (6,8)).\n\nDOWN",

Although eating grows me (tail won't move this turn) and slightly reduces mobility, the two immediate follow-up exits (UP to 2,4 or LEFT to 1,3) remain open and the enemy is far to the right, so the move is safe and gains score advantage.\n- LEFT or DOWN are safe alternatives to approach (1,1), but they forgo the guaranteed apple right now.

Its one-step options are (7,3), (8,2), (9,3) (up into its own body at 8,4 is illegal). None of those reach the three candidate squares this turn, so no immediate head-on risk for any of them.\n- (6,3) is occupied by enemy body, so moving to a square that forces me to go into (6,3) next turn would be bad. From UP (5,3) or RIGHT (6,2) I should avoid a follow-up move into (6,3).\n\nEvaluation of candidates:\n- UP \u2192 (5,3): keeps access to open space above (5,4) and left (4,3). Good escape options (2+). Does not directly progress to the nearby apple cluster or the apple at (8,1).\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,2): moves back toward my long body loop and tighter space near (3,2)/(3,3)/(4,4). This risks getting boxed in; fewer safe continuations (left is blocked by my own (3,2)).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2): moves into more open territory toward the unobstructed right/lower area and toward the apple at (8,1). From (6,2) I'll have at least two follow-up choices (down to 6,1 or right to 7,2), keeping mobility and options to contest or cede the (8,1) apple depending on the opponent's behavior.\n\nStrategic takeaway / short plan for next turns:\n- Prefer open-space moves; avoid returning into the tight corridor near my tail. Move RIGHT to open up options, then evaluate for a quick approach to (8,1) (or pivot north/east toward the top apples if the opponent commits to the lower apple). Watch the enemy head: if it commits down toward (8,1), give it space and pivot to safer apples or consolidate my lead. Avoid moves that force stepping into (6,3) (enemy body) or into my own cramped area.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is also likely to go DOWN to (8,1), so RIGHT risks a simultaneous head clash if they instead go LEFT.\n- UP (6,3) is clear this turn but puts me adjacent to the enemy body at (6,4), reducing safe follow-ups (moving up again would be death). It tightens my escape options.\n- DOWN (6,1) is safe this turn, avoids immediate head-on danger, and keeps options open (can go to 7,1 or circle). It concedes the immediate lower apple if the opponent dives for (8,1), but preserves my life and mobility \u2014 my top priorities with a lead of 17 vs 14.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take a safe move this turn to avoid head-on risk and preserve freedom of movement.\n- If the opponent takes (8,1), pivot toward the less-contested apples (2,7) or 3,8 from safer routes; otherwise, if they hesitate, approach the lower apple only when it can be captured without risking a head collision.\n\nDOWN",

It also avoids the dense enemy corridor on the right.\n- After moving UP, watch for my tail vacating spaces (especially around x=1..6) so I can route left without boxing myself in.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns:\n- Move UP now to gain room.\n- Then aim left and up to reach the apple at (3,5), using available open rows to avoid the enemy\u2019s tight right-side formation.\n- Preserve at least two escape directions at each step (avoid getting into the narrow corridor near the enemy body).\n- If the enemy becomes trapped or takes a risky move, capitalize on any safe apples they leave exposed.\n\nUP",
