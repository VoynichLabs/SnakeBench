Illegal move.\n- DOWN to (5, 8): This is my body segment. Illegal move (self-collision).\n- LEFT to (4, 9): This is within the board and not occupied by my body or the enemy. Safe move.\n- RIGHT to (6, 9): This is within the board and not occupied by my body or the enemy. Safe move.\n\nThe safe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow I need to choose the best safe move. I will aim for the closest apple. My current position is (5, 9).\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n- (9, 2): |9-5| + |2-9| = 4 + 7 = 11\n- (7, 2): |7-5| + |2-9| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- (7, 9): |7-5| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (0, 2): |0-5| + |2-9| = 5 + 7 = 12\n- (1, 5): |1-5| + |5-9| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 9) with a distance of 2.\n\nNow, evaluate the safe moves based on their distance to (7, 9):\n- Move LEFT to (4, 9): Distance to (7, 9) from (4, 9) is |7-4| + |9-9| = 3 + 0 = 3. Moving LEFT increases the distance to the closest apple.\n- Move RIGHT to (6, 9): Distance to (7, 9) from (6, 9) is |7-6| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1. Moving RIGHT decreases the distance to the closest apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the better option as it moves me closer to the closest apple (7, 9). The enemy snake at (7, 3) is not a threat to this move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (6, 9). The closest apple will be at (7, 9).

Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nThe closest apples from my current position (7, 7) are (7, 4) and (8, 5), both 3 steps away (Manhattan distance).\n\nLet's consider where each safe move places me and the distance to these closest apples:\n- Move DOWN to (7, 6):\n    - Distance to (7, 4): |7-7| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 steps.\n    - Distance to (8, 5): |7-8| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps.\n    - Both closest apples are 2 steps away.\n- Move LEFT to (6, 7):\n    - Distance to (7, 4): |6-7| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n    - Distance to (8, 5): |6-8| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps.\n    - Both closest apples are 4 steps away.\n- Move RIGHT to (8, 7):\n    - Distance to (7, 4): |8-7| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n    - Distance to (8, 5): |8-8| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2 steps.\n    - One closest apple is 2 steps away, the other is 4 steps away.\n\nMoving LEFT takes me further away from the closest apples compared to DOWN or RIGHT.\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT move me closer to the desirable apples. Moving DOWN brings both (7,4) and (8,5) to a distance of 2 steps for the next turn, making them equally accessible. Moving RIGHT brings (8,5) to 2 steps but keeps (7,4) at 4 steps.\n\nMoving DOWN appears to be the most efficient path towards collecting the two closest apples, (7,4) and (8,5), simultaneously. It also keeps me away from the enemy snake located near the bottom right of the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (7,6), I will assess the board from that position. The apples at (7,4) and (8,5) will be 2 steps away. Depending on which path is safest (avoiding walls, my body, and the enemy snake), I will decide whether to continue towards (7,4) or turn towards (8,5).\n\nDOWN"

I have just eaten the apple at (7, 4), which is why my head is now at that location and my body includes my previous head position (7,5) while maintaining its length due to growth.\n\nThe available apples on the board for the next move are at (0, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 4), (5, 8), and (8, 5). Note that the apple at (7, 4) is under my head, indicating I just ate it. The apple at (8, 5) is under the enemy's head.\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves from (7, 4):\n- UP to (7, 5): My body is at (7, 5). Illegal (self-collision).\n- DOWN to (7, 3): This square is empty and within bounds. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6, 4): This square is empty and within bounds. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (8, 4): The enemy snake's body is at (8, 4). Illegal (collision with enemy body).\n\nThe safe and available moves are DOWN (to 7,3) and LEFT (to 6,4).\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake's position and possible moves. The enemy head is at (8, 5).\nPossible safe moves for the enemy from (8, 5) are UP to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 5). The enemy cannot move to (7, 3) or (6, 4) this turn, so both my safe moves are guaranteed to be free of enemy collision this turn.\n\nNow let's evaluate which safe move is better for positioning towards apples:\n- If I move DOWN to (7, 3): The closest apples would be (8, 5) at distance |7-8| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3, and (3, 4) at distance |7-3| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n- If I move LEFT to (6, 4): The closest apples would be (3, 4) at distance |6-3| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3, and (8, 5) at distance |6-8| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBoth safe moves position me 3 steps away from the closest apple(s). Moving LEFT to (6,4) brings me closer to the apple at (3,4) compared to moving DOWN. Moving LEFT also keeps me equally close to the apple at (8,5). The cluster of apples on the left side of the board ((0,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4)) is generally more accessible by moving LEFT.\n\nMoving LEFT towards the center-left of the board seems like a better strategic choice to access multiple apples, while remaining safe from immediate collision.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I move LEFT to (6,4), my head will be at (6,4). I will then assess the new board state. The apple at (3,4) will be 3 steps away. I will likely prioritize moving towards the closest safe apple, while keeping track of the enemy's position and potential movements. The apples at (1,4) (5 steps away) and (1,5) (6 steps away) will also become potential targets.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Its possible moves (UP to (8,8), LEFT to (7,7), RIGHT to (9,7)) are all distant from my current position and safe moves.\n\nBased on efficiently moving towards the closest apple while remaining safe, moving LEFT is the optimal choice.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (4, 4). The apple at (3, 4) is now only 1 step away. Provided the apple is still there and the space at (3, 4) is clear (no new snake head/body there), my plan is to move LEFT again to eat the apple.

From (3, 4), I could move UP to (3, 5) (distance 1) or LEFT to (2, 4) (distance 1) as the first step towards (1,5).\n\nComparing the immediate moves towards the closest apple (1,4):\n- Move LEFT to (2, 4): New distance to (1, 4) is |2-1| + |4-4| = 1. This is a good step.\nComparing the immediate moves towards the second closest apple (1,5):\n- Move UP to (3, 5): New distance to (1, 5) is |3-1| + |5-5| = 2. This is a good step.\n- Move LEFT to (2, 4): New distance to (1, 5) is |2-1| + |4-5| = 2. This is also a good step.\n\nThe apple at (1, 4) is the absolute closest. Moving LEFT is the most direct first step towards it.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far away and not a concern for this immediate move.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 4) is a safe move and brings me closer to the closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (2, 4). I will aim to move LEFT again to reach the apple at (1, 4), provided it is still safe and available.\n\nThe final decision is to move LEFT.\n\nLEFT"

Safe.\n- DOWN to (0, 5): This square is occupied by the first segment of my body (T). Illegal.\n- LEFT to (-1, 6): This is outside the board (wall). Illegal.\n- RIGHT to (1, 6): This square is currently empty (.). Safe.\n\nMy only safe and valid moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, let's evaluate which safe move is better. My goal is to reach an apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nThe apples are at (0, 2), (7, 3), (6, 1), (8, 4), (9, 1).\nThe closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance from my head (0, 6) is (0, 2) (|0-0| + |6-2| = 4).\n\nHowever, moving directly towards (0, 2) by going DOWN is blocked by my body segment at (0, 5).\nMy body forms a barrier below my head: (0,5), (1,5), and the line from (1,4) to (6,4). I cannot move straight down column 0 past (0,6) because (0,5) is occupied by my body. Furthermore, the square (0,5) will remain occupied by a body segment after my next move, as my body shifts.\n\nI need to find a path around my own body to reach an apple.\nLet's consider the safe moves:\n1.  Move UP to (0, 7): From (0, 7), I can potentially move right or further up. Moving right (1,7), (2,7)... seems ok initially, but the enemy snake body is at (4,7), blocking movement past x=4 at y=7. This path doesn't seem ideal for getting around my body barrier towards the lower half of the board.\n2.  Move RIGHT to (1, 6): From (1, 6), I can potentially move right or up. Moving right (2,6), (3,6)... looks promising as it moves me away from the x=0 wall and past the initial body blockage at (0,5) and (1,5).\n\nLet's explore a path starting with moving RIGHT to (1, 6).\nCurrent: (0, 6) -> RIGHT -> (1, 6)\nFrom (1, 6), I can continue moving RIGHT: (1, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (3, 6).\nAt (3, 6), I am next to the enemy head at (4, 6). I should avoid moving towards (4, 6). I can move DOWN to (3, 5). (3, 5) is currently empty and is below the y=6 level where I was.\nFrom (3, 5), I can continue moving RIGHT, staying in the clear y=5 row (my body is at (0,5), (1,5), but (2,5) onwards seems open): (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5).\nFrom (7, 5), I am now past the x-range of the main horizontal body barrier (1,4)-(6,4). I can move DOWN towards the apples.\n(7,5) -> (7,4). (7,4) is empty.\n(7,4) -> (7,3). (7,3) is an apple!\n\nThis path is: (0,6) -> (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) -> (7,4) -> (7,3).\nThis path successfully navigates around my body and leads to the apple at (7,3). The first step of this path is RIGHT. The enemy snake does not seem to block this path based on its current position.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the best strategic move to get around my body and reach an apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Follow the planned path towards the apple at (7,3). The path is: (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (7,5) -> (7,4) -> (7,3). Continuously check for obstacles (my growing body, enemy movement) and adjust the path as needed. Re-evaluate the closest reachable apple after each move.\n\nThe final decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT"

My head is at (2, 6).\nMy body segments are at [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\nApples are at: (0, 2), (7, 3), (6, 1), (8, 4), (9, 1).\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (6, 6). Enemy body is at [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8)].\n\nMy current position is (2, 6). Let's check the possible moves:\n- UP to (2, 7): This square is empty (.). Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 5): This square is empty (.). Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 6): This square is occupied by my body (T). Illegal.\n- RIGHT to (3, 6): This square is empty (.). Safe.\n\nMy safe and valid moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\nMy snake's body creates a barrier to my left and south (at y=4 and y=5, and x=0, 1). The previous move RIGHT to (2,6) successfully moved me away from the immediate body segments at (1,6) and (0,6).\n\nTo reach the apples, which are predominantly in the lower and eastern parts of the board, I need to move generally south or east.\n- Moving UP to (2, 7) would take me further north, away from all apples and not help in getting around my body.\n- Moving DOWN to (2, 5) moves me south, towards the apples. However, it places my head adjacent to my body segment at (2, 4), potentially limiting future movement options in the south direction directly below.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 6) moves me east, towards several apples and further away from the main bulk of my body. From (3,6), I can potentially move DOWN to (3,5), which is currently empty, providing a path to move south past my main body blockage.\n\nComparing DOWN to (2,5) and RIGHT to (3,6):\nMoving DOWN to (2,5) leads to a situation where my only safe move next turn is likely RIGHT to (3,5) to avoid colliding with my body. This forces a specific path.\nMoving RIGHT to (3,6) offers slightly more flexibility, allowing me to move DOWN to (3,5) or UP to (3,7) next turn (though DOWN is preferred for apple access). More importantly, moving RIGHT gets me further east before attempting to move south past the body barrier. This seems like a cleaner way to navigate around my own snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,6). Moving RIGHT to (3,6) brings me horizontally closer, but maintains a safe distance this turn and next turn (3 squares away from head, adjacent to enemy body at (4,6), but moving onto enemy body is illegal). Moving DOWN to (2,5) maintains horizontal distance. The immediate safety from the enemy is comparable for both moves this turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,6) is the best move to continue the strategy of maneuvering around my body blockage to reach the apples in the south-east. It positions me well to move into the clear space at (3,5) on the subsequent turn.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to evaluate moving DOWN to (3,5) to continue progress towards the apples in the lower half of the board, assuming it remains safe.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving DOWN to (3, 4) provides slightly better future flexibility by opening up four safe directions for the next turn, whereas moving RIGHT to (4, 5) has one direction blocked by an enemy body segment. Moving DOWN also positions me well to potentially head towards the apple at (0, 2), which becomes one of the closest targets and appears easily accessible via (2, 4) once my tail vacates that spot. Moving RIGHT seems slightly less advantageous due to the proximity of the enemy body block at (4, 6).\n\nContinuing the strategy from the previous turn to navigate around my body block and move towards apples, moving DOWN to (3, 4) seems the more prudent and flexible choice.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to assess the options from (3,4), likely targeting the apple at (0,2) by attempting to move LEFT towards (2,4) if that square is confirmed free after my tail moves.

Moving UP to (3, 5) would collide with my own body.\n\nMy body segments currently occupy several cells to the north and west of my head. The tail is at (1, 4) and will vacate this cell after the move, unless I eat an apple.\n\nThe apples are located at (0, 2), (7, 3), (6, 1), (8, 4), and (9, 1).\n\nLet's evaluate the safe moves:\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (3, 3):**\n    *   This cell is currently empty.\n    *   From (3, 3), potential next moves are DOWN to (3, 2), LEFT to (2, 3), or RIGHT to (4, 3). Moving UP to (3, 4) would be a collision with my body.\n    *   This move takes me further away from the densest part of my body mass to the north and west.\n    *   From (3,3), there are clear paths towards the apple at (7,3) (e.g., via (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)) and towards the apple at (0,2) (e.g., via (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2)).\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   This cell is currently empty.\n    *   From (2, 4), potential next moves are UP to (2, 5), DOWN to (2, 3), or LEFT to (1, 4). Moving RIGHT to (3, 4) would be a collision with my body. Note that (1, 4) is currently my tail, but will be free after this move.\n    *   This move positions me well to potentially head towards the apple at (0, 2). The path (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) appears open and directly uses the space vacated by my tail, which is often an efficient way to move towards an apple near the tail.\n\n3.  **Move RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   This cell is currently empty.\n    *   From (4, 4), potential next moves are UP to (4, 5), DOWN to (4, 3), or RIGHT to (5, 4). Moving LEFT to (3, 4) would be a collision with my body.\n    *   This move takes me away from my main body mass but towards the area of the enemy snake's body (e.g., (4, 6)). While safe this turn, it places me closer to potential enemy interactions. The apple at (8, 4) is in this general direction, but the enemy head is at (7, 4), making a direct approach risky.\n\nConsidering the previous turn's rationale, which involved moving DOWN to (3,4) and stated the potential plan was to \"assess the options from (3,4), likely targeting the apple at (0,2) by attempting to move LEFT towards (2,4) if that square is confirmed free after my tail moves,\" moving LEFT to (2,4) directly follows this strategic intention. This move places me on a clear path towards the apple at (0,2) by utilizing the space that my tail will vacate.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT aligns best with the previously stated strategy to approach the apple at (0,2).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to evaluate the options from (2,4), prioritizing the path towards the apple at (0,2) via (1,4) while ensuring I avoid collisions and potential self-traps near the board edge or my body.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

This move reduces the Manhattan distance to the apple (from 4 to 3).\n\n2.  **Move DOWN to (2, 3):** This move also takes me closer to the apple (distance 3). From (2,3), I can move towards (0,2) via paths like (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) or (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2).\n\n3.  **Move UP to (2, 5):** This move takes me further from the apple (distance 5) and towards the densest part of my body, which is less ideal.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are good options that move me closer to the target apple (0,2).

This positions me well to continue down column 0 towards the apple or move to (1,3) if necessary.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to evaluate options from (1,4), focusing on moving towards the apple at (0,2), likely via (0,4) if it remains safe, or considering alternative paths like (1,3) or (1,5) if the tail vacates it.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

This move directly approaches the target apple. The Manhattan distance to the apple (0,2) is 2 from my current position (0,4).\n- Moving DOWN to (0, 3) reduces the distance to the apple to 1.\n- Moving UP to (0, 5) increases the distance to the apple to 3.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0, 3) aligns with the previous strategy and moves me closer to the nearest apple.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to evaluate options from (0, 3), focusing on moving directly towards the apple at (0,2) by moving DOWN, assuming this cell remains safe and the apple is still there.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Both paths are safe and avoid immediate collision with my own body or the enemy snake. Moving right positions me better to approach the central part of the board where multiple apples are located.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Assuming I successfully move RIGHT to (1,2), my head will be at (1,2). Safe moves will likely include UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), and RIGHT to (2,2). I will then re-evaluate the closest safe path to the nearest apple from the new position (1,2), considering the updated board state and snake positions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Unsafe.\n- Move RIGHT to (2, 2): Within board limits. Not in my body. Not enemy head or body. Safe.\n\nMy safe options are UP to (1, 3), DOWN to (1, 1), and RIGHT to (2, 2).\n\nNow let's consider which safe move brings me closer to the available apples.\nThe apples are at (7, 3), (6, 1), (8, 8), (1, 9), (5, 4).\nCurrent head position: (1, 2).\n\nCalculate Manhattan distance from current head (1, 2) to each apple:\n- To (7, 3): |7-1| + |3-2| = 6 + 1 = 7\n- To (6, 1): |6-1| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- To (8, 8): |8-1| + |8-2| = 7 + 6 = 13\n- To (1, 9): |1-1| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7\n- To (5, 4): |5-1| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nThe closest apples are (6, 1) and (5, 4), both at distance 6.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to the closest apples after taking each safe step:\nIf I move UP to (1, 3):\n- Distance to (6, 1) from (1, 3): |6-1| + |1-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- Distance to (5, 4) from (1, 3): |5-1| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\nMoving UP reduces the distance to apple (5, 4) to 5.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 1):\n- Distance to (6, 1) from (1, 1): |6-1| + |1-1| = 5 + 0 = 5\n- Distance to (5, 4) from (1, 1): |5-1| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7\nMoving DOWN reduces the distance to apple (6, 1) to 5.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 2):\n- Distance to (6, 1) from (2, 2): |6-2| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- Distance to (5, 4) from (2, 2): |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5\nMoving RIGHT reduces the distance to both apple (6, 1) and apple (5, 4) to 5.\n\nAll three safe moves reduce the distance to at least one of the closest apples. Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) reaches a position that is distance 5 from two of the closest apples ((6,1) and (5,4)), whereas moving UP or DOWN reaches a position distance 5 from only one of them. Moving RIGHT also positions me more centrally on the board, towards the main cluster of apples (7,3), (6,1), (5,4).\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT seems the most advantageous move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Assume I successfully move RIGHT to (2, 2). My head will be at (2, 2). I will then re-evaluate the safe paths and closest apples from this new position, taking into account the updated board state and snake positions.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

No.\n    - Safe.\n\nMy safe moves are UP to (3, 3), DOWN to (3, 1), and RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nNow let's evaluate which safe move brings me closer to the available apples: (7, 3), (8, 8), (1, 9), (5, 4), (1, 5). My current head is at (3, 2).\n\nManhattan distances from (3, 2) to each apple:\n- (7, 3): |7-3| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- (8, 8): |8-3| + |8-2| = 5 + 6 = 11\n- (1, 9): |1-3| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9\n- (5, 4): |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- (1, 5): |1-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 4) with a distance of 4. The next closest are (7, 3) and (1, 5) at distance 5.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to the closest apple (5, 4) after taking each safe step:\n- If I move UP to (3, 3): Distance to (5, 4) = |5-3| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Decreased)\n- If I move DOWN to (3, 1): Distance to (5, 4) = |5-3| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5 (Increased)\n- If I move RIGHT to (4, 2): Distance to (5, 4) = |5-4| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Decreased)\n\nBoth moving UP and moving RIGHT decrease the distance to the closest apple (5, 4).\n\nNow let's consider the distances to the second closest apples (7, 3) and (1, 5) after these moves:\n- If I move UP to (3, 3):\n    - Distance to (7, 3) = |7-3| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4 (Decreased from 5)\n    - Distance to (1, 5) = |1-3| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 (Decreased from 5)\n- If I move RIGHT to (4, 2):\n    - Distance to (7, 3) = |7-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 (Decreased from 5)\n    - Distance to (1, 5) = |1-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6 (Increased from 5)\n\nMoving UP to (3, 3) puts me at distance 3 from (5, 4), distance 4 from (7, 3), and distance 4 from (1, 5). This keeps me relatively close to the cluster of closer apples.\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 2) puts me at distance 3 from (5, 4), distance 4 from (7, 3), but distance 6 from (1, 5).\n\nMoving UP maintains better access to the other nearby apples. It also moves me towards a more central part of the board compared to moving RIGHT which takes me closer to the right edge where the enemy snake has a heavier presence, although not immediately threatening.\n\nMy strategy is to move towards the closest apple while maintaining safety and options for other nearby apples. Moving UP achieves this goal effectively.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Both lead to the closest apple (5,4) with distance 2.\n\nNow I consider the enemy snake position. Enemy head is at (6, 2).\nMoving UP to (3, 4) keeps me further away from the general area of the enemy snake (right side of the board).\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) moves me closer to the enemy snake's side.\n\nGiven that both UP and RIGHT are efficient paths to the closest apple (5,4), I choose the move that keeps me safer relative to the enemy snake. Moving UP maintains a greater distance from the enemy and positions me better to access the left side of the board, which is less congested by the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the closest safe apple, prioritizing safety by avoiding the enemy snake's immediate vicinity and potential trap situations.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

Both lead to the closest apple (5,4) with distance 2.\n\nNow I consider the enemy snake position. Enemy head is at (6, 2).\nMoving UP to (3, 4) keeps me further away from the general area of the enemy snake (right side of the board).\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) moves me closer to the enemy snake's side.\n\nGiven that both UP and RIGHT are efficient paths to the closest apple (5,4), I choose the move that keeps me safer relative to the enemy snake. Moving UP maintains a greater distance from the enemy and positions me better to access the left side of the board, which is less congested by the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving towards the closest safe apple, prioritizing safety by avoiding the enemy snake's immediate vicinity and potential trap situations.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."
