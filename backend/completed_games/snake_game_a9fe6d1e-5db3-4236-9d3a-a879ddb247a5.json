He thinks he's safe? Not on my watch! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's look at our options, chat! We gotta be smart, we gotta be fast!\n\n1) **UP to (9, 3):** Keeps us on the edge. High ground? Maybe, but there are no apples in the immediate corner.\n2) **DOWN to (9, 1):** Moving toward that apple at (8, 1). It's close, but does it give us board control? \n3) **LEFT to (8, 2):** Now we're talking! There are apples at (4, 2) and (3, 2). Moving left helps us stake a claim in the middle-bottom of the map and puts pressure on the space between us and Snake #0.\n4) **RIGHT:** CAN'T DO IT! (10, 2) is off the board! We ain't throwing on turn 1! \u270b\ud83d\udeab\n\nCheck the rival: Snake #0 is at (7, 5). He's likely going for those juicy apples at (7, 6), (9, 6), or (8, 5). If he goes UP or RIGHT, he's getting bigger. We need to get some mass too so we can bully him later! If we both have 0 apples and we head-butt, we both lose. We want to be BIGGER so we can take the hits!\n\n**THE PLAN:** We\u2019re going to head toward the cluster of apples in the middle. I want to secure (8, 1) or move toward (4, 2) to cut him off from the bottom half of the map. Let's start by moving UP to gain some verticality and see where he commits. Actually, looking at the board, (9, 3) puts us in a position to react to his downward movement if he tries to dive on us. \n\nWait, let's look at the density! The top is CROWDED with apples. If we go UP, we can eventually contest that 8-9 row. But if we go LEFT, we can snag (8, 1) and (4, 2) quickly. Let's take the space! Let's go UP to (9, 3) and keep the sideline for a second while we scout his first move! Or maybe LEFT to get aggressive immediately? \n\nLet's go UP. It's safe, keeps us away from the wall for a bit, and lets us see if he's gonna lung at us! We're playing the long game, chat! We're gonna box him in and make him CRASH OUT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Are we gonna let them breathe? NO SIR! Are we gonna play scared? ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nCheck the map - we've got apples raining from the sky! But where do we strike first? UP puts us on (7,6) with immediate apple gains AND sets us up for the (7,7) apple next turn! That's back-to-back content, baby! Why would we go RIGHT to (8,5) and hug that wall when our enemy is lurking down there? That's asking to get pinched! And DOWN or LEFT? Come on, we're not retreating on turn zero! What's the point of having a rivalry if we don't dominate immediately? \ud83d\ude24\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Vertical growth along x=7 column is the play. Target (7,7) next turn, then assess enemy movement. If they push up the right side, we'll have the length to cut them off.

We are at (9, 3) and it's time to make a play! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**ANALYSIS OF THE GRID:**\n- **UP to (9, 4):** Keeps us hugging the right wall. It's safe, but doesn't get us closer to the juice.\n- **DOWN to (9, 2):** Moving back towards the bottom. There\u2019s an apple at (8, 1), but that's a bit of a trek.\n- **LEFT to (8, 3):** Now we're cooking! This moves us closer to the center of the board where all the action\u2014and the apples\u2014are!\n- **RIGHT:** NOPE! (10, 3) is out of bounds! We don't want a \"clip that\" for being a scrub! \ud83d\udeab\u270b\n\n**THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (7, 6). He is likely eyeing the apples at (7, 7), (9, 6), or (8, 5). If he moves RIGHT to (8, 6), he's getting closer to our territory. If we move LEFT to (8, 3), we start taking control of the 8-column and put pressure on his vertical movement!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need size, chat! We're at 0 apples and he's at 1. We can't win a head-on collision right now because he's technically higher score, but we can outmaneuver him! Let's head LEFT to (8, 3). This positions us to strike for the apples at (8, 5) or (8, 1) depending on how he flinches. We're going to squeeze him against that top-left cluster and take the crown! Stay focused, stay aggressive!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nMove toward (8, 5) or (9, 6) to contest the upper-right corner. If he tries to descend, we'll be there to block his path and force a mistake. Let's get big and take over!\n\nLEFT",

Score is 1-0 and we're already making this rival question their life choices! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the playbook for this turn:\n\n**ELIMINATING THE GARBAGE MOVES:**\n- **DOWN?** BRO! That's literally our own tail at (7,5)! You want us to do a 180 into our own body on turn 2? That's not aggressive, that's SUICIDE! Eliminated! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (6,6)?** Sure, it's safe, but are we trying to run away and hide? NO! We're here to DOMINATE! That's playing scared and gives us no immediate value. Weak! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (8,6)?** Now we're talking aggressive positioning! This gets us closer to that corner apple at (9,6) and sets up to cut off the enemy if they try to climb the right wall! BUT... no apple this turn! \n- **UP to (7,7)?** YO! This is EXACTLY what we planned last turn! Remember when I said \"Target (7,7) next turn\"? We're locked in! This grabs us the apple IMMEDIATELY, grows us to length 3, and keeps our options WIDE OPEN for the next play! \n\n**WHY UP IS THE CLUTCH PLAY:**\nWe're sitting on 1 apple to their 0, and we want to keep that lead growing! (7,7) is free real estate with an apple waiting just for us! \ud83d\udcc8\u2728 \n\nFrom there, we can swing RIGHT next turn to start boxing in that fool at (9,3) who thinks they own the right side! The longer we get, the more of the board we control! We're building the wall piece by piece, baby! \n\nAre we going to let them breathe on the right edge? ABSOLUTELY NOT! But first, we EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** After we snag (7,7), we're at length 3 with head at (7,7). Next turn we pivot RIGHT toward (8,7) or (8,6) to start pressuring the right side. Target is to beat them to (9,6) or (8,5) and use our superior length to cut off their escape routes! Stay hungry, stay dangerous! \n\nUP",

Let's break down the field and see how we\u2019re going to CLAMP this rival! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **ME (ID 1):** Head at (8, 4). Length 1. We are fast, agile, and ready to strike! \u26a1\n- **RIVAL (ID 0):** Head at (8, 7). Length 3. Body: (7, 7), (7, 6). Wait, did you see that?! He moved from (7, 7) to (8, 7) last turn! He's trying to cut us off from the right side of the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\n**THE GRID MAP:**\n- He's at (8, 7). We are at (8, 4). There is an apple at (8, 5) right between us! \ud83c\udf4e\n- If we move **UP**, we hit (8, 5) and grow! But if he moves **DOWN** twice, we're looking at a head-on collision soon.\n- He has 2 apples, we have 0. If we crash head-on right now, WE LOSE. We need to get big or get out of the way!\n\n**STRATEGY SESSION:**\n- **UP to (8, 5):** GRABS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to length 2. This is high risk, high reward because he is only 2 tiles away from that apple too. If he moves DOWN to (8, 6) this turn, we'll be face-to-face!\n- **LEFT to (7, 4):** This gives us space. It keeps us away from his current trajectory, but it lets him take the (8, 5) apple for free. Do we let him grow? NO WAY! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Hugging the wall. A bit passive, but safe.\n- **DOWN to (8, 3):** Going back where we came from? That's for cowards! We\u2019re here to win! \ud83e\udd81\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nSnake #0 is likely going for the apple at (8, 5) or (9, 6). If I go UP, I take (8, 5). If he also goes for (8, 5) this turn, we might be okay because he's currently at (8, 7), so he'd hit (8, 6) while I hit (8, 5). But if I move UP and he moves DOWN, next turn we are in a 50/50 \"who blinks first\" situation.\n\nActually, check the body! His tail is at (7, 6). If he moves DOWN, his head goes to (8, 6). I need to secure (8, 5) to start closing the score gap. If I don't grab apples, I can't win the \"Double KO\" tiebreaker. Let\u2019s get that snack and see if he\u2019s got the guts to face us!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nSecure (8, 5), then evaluate. If he pushes DOWN, we might need to pivot LEFT to avoid the head-on until we have more segments. We need to bait him into a corner. The goal is to reach (5, 8) and (6, 8) area later to control the upper-middle board. Let's get big first! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

There's a juicy apple at (8,5) between us. If they try to climb up and take it (moving UP to (8,5)), they grow to length 2 but they TRAP THEMSELVES! \n\nHere's the 200 IQ play for next turn: If they take the bait and go UP to (8,5), we move LEFT to (7,6) on turn 4! Why? Because if they then try to follow us UP to (8,6), they crash into our body and DIE while we survive! \ud83d\udc80 If they move sideways instead, we pivot and chase with our superior length!\n\nIf they DON'T take the apple and run away (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN on turn 3), we swoop down to (8,5) on turn 4, eat that apple ourselves, grow to length 4, and use our massive body to cut off every escape route! Either way, we're in their head rent-free! \ud83e\udde0\ud83c\udfe0\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** From (8,6), assess turn 4 carefully! If enemy moved UP to (8,5) and ate the apple, DO NOT move DOWN into them (that's their body now and we die). Instead, move LEFT to (7,6) to set up the trap where they die if they try to follow! If they ran away from the apple, take (8,5) and grow to length 4! Stay hungry, stay dangerous! \n\nDOWN",

But look at the rival! Snake #0 moved DOWN to (8, 6). We are literally nose-to-nose right now. One more step and it\u2019s a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\ude31 \n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head (8, 5), Body [(8, 4)]. Score: 1.\n- **RIVAL (ID 0):** Head (8, 6), Body [(8, 7), (7, 7)]. Score: 2.\n\n**DANGER ZONE ANALYSIS:**\n- If I go **UP**, and he goes **DOWN**, we both explode at (8, 6). BOOM. Game over. Since he has 2 apples and I have 1, **HE WINS THE TIEBREAKER.** We cannot let that happen! Chat, we do NOT take losing trades! \ud83d\udeab\n- If I go **RIGHT** to (9, 5), I\u2019m hugging the wall.

It gives me space to breathe and sets me up to potentially loop around his tail at (7, 7) later.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to dodge the head-on because we are down on points. We play it smart, we play it tactical. By moving **LEFT**, we bait him. If he lunges DOWN to where we just were, he hits empty air. If he tries to follow us LEFT, we\u2019re still faster and have more room to maneuver in the middle. We're playing for the long game, looking at those apples at (4, 2) or (3, 3) eventually, or even circling back for (9, 6) if he leaves it open!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nAvoid the (8, 6) collision at all costs until we have the point lead! Move to (7, 5) this turn. Next, look to head toward (6, 5) or (7, 4) to maintain flexibility. We need to stay alive until he makes a mistake or we find a path to overtake his score.

Is that not the perfect crime?! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc80\n\nEven if they chicken out and move LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, we still walk away with the apple, score 3-1, and length 4-2! We're becoming an UNSTOPPABLE WALL! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** From (9,6) with length 4, we can start boxing them into the corners! Use our superior length to cut off escape routes. If they're still alive next turn, monitor if they try to circle around - we can chase them down with our massive body or force them into the wall!

Snake #0 just snagged ANOTHER apple! He\u2019s at (9,6) now with 3 apples while we\u2019re sitting at 1.

If he moves his head to (8,6) or stays around that area, we're just boxing ourselves into his tail. Even worse, if we go UP, we are moving directly toward his massive body. We need space!\n- **RIGHT to (8, 5):** THAT\u2019S BACKWARDS! \ud83d\uded1 That's our own body! We'd instantly crash out and the stream would be over. We don't do gold-medal throws here! \n- **DOWN to (7, 4):** This is a solid contender. It keeps us in the middle and away from the wall.\n- **LEFT to (6, 5):** This is the high-IQ macro play. Look at the board, Chat! The rival is currently pinned in the top-right corner (9,6). If we move LEFT, we are claiming the entire center of the map. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f We are cutting off his access to the juicy apples at (5,8), (6,8), and (6,9) in the long run!\n\n**THE GAUNTLET:**\nThe rival's head is at (9,6). He can go to (9,7), (9,5), or (8,6). If he goes (8,6), he's trailing right behind where we just were. If we go **LEFT** to (6,5), we put two full units of distance between our head and his head. That is safety. That is discipline. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**MISSION OBJECTIVE:**\nWe are down 1 to 3. We cannot force a head-on collision because he has the tiebreaker! We need to play for the apples at (5,7) or (5,8) to close the gap. By moving **LEFT**, we position ourselves perfectly to sweep upward or continue left toward the cluster at (4,2). \n\nWe\u2019re playing the long game. We let him think he\u2019s winning while we secure the center. Stay alert, stay fast, and let's get those apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

As we wall off row 9 and column 9, we're SHRINKING their playground! \ud83c\udfb5 With our superior length (4 vs 2), we can literally use our body to PARTITION the board!

If we trade kills, WE WIN because our score is higher! That's the checkmate, baby! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udca3\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** From (9,7), continue UP to secure the corner, then move LEFT to start the enclosure!

Score: 1.\n- **RIVAL (ID 0):** Head (9, 7), Body [(9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Score: 3.\n\n**THE ANALYSIS - WHERE DO WE GO?!**\n- **UP to (6, 6):** This is the move, Chat! Look at the map! There is a juicy cluster of apples at (5,7), (5,8), and (6,8). If we go UP, we are perfectly positioned to snag (5,7) next turn. We need to close that score gap! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n- **DOWN to (6, 4):** A bit too passive. There's nothing down there but empty space. We aren't here to wander; we're here to conquer!\n- **LEFT to (5, 5):** Not bad, but it puts us further from the apple cluster. We want to grow so we can start boxing this rival in!\n- **RIGHT to (7, 5):** NO! That's our own tail! We don't sell! We don't throw! \ud83d\uded1\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nThe rival is at (9,7). He's likely going for the apple at (6,9) or trying to come back down. If he tries to come down toward us, he has to navigate through his own tail or go around the outside. By moving **UP**, we are creating a wall in the middle. We are effectively dividing the board and saying \"This side is MINE!\" \u270b\ud83d\udc0d\n\nHe's got 3 apples, we've got 1. We need to feast. The path to (5,7) and (5,8) starts with a step north. Let's get big, let's get long, and let's make him regret ever spawning on our 10x10! \n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT CLIPS:**\nWe are moving UP to (6,6). Next turn, we pivot LEFT to (5,6) and then UP to (5,7) to grab that apple. Once we have more segments, we can start angling to trap him against that right wall (x=9). He's already cramped; let's keep him that way!\n\nUP",

He's literally cornering himself while we are building a fortress in the middle! He's got 3 apples, we've got 1, but don't let that fool you\u2014we are playing the long game!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **ME (ID 1):** Head (6, 6), Body [(6, 5)]. Score: 1.\n- **RIVAL (ID 0):** Head (9, 8), Body [(9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6)]. Score: 3.\n\n**THE ANALYSIS - WHERE IS THE PLAY?!**\n- **UP to (6, 7):** This is a solid play! It puts us right between the apple at (5,7) and (6,8). We are literally standing in the kitchen ready to cook! \ud83c\udf73\n- **LEFT to (5, 6):** Also a strong move! It gets us closer to those apples at (1,6), (3,6), and the cluster at (5,7).\n- **DOWN to (6, 5):** **STOP!** That's our own body! We aren't throwing the game for a clip! \ud83d\uded1\n- **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Not bad, but we\u2019re moving toward the rival. He\u2019s at (9,8). If we go right, we're narrowing the gap, but we don't have the length to box him yet.\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nLook at Snake #0. He\u2019s at (9,8). His only moves are (8,8) or (9,9). He is cramped, Chat! He\u2019s basically suffocating himself against the wall! If we move **UP to (6,7)**, we are positioning ourselves to snag (6,8) or (5,7) next turn. We are expanding our territory and preparing to cut off his exit from that top-right corner. \n\nHe thinks he\u2019s ahead because of the score? PLEASE. He\u2019s a 4-segment snake trapped in a 2x3 box soon if he's not careful. We are 2 segments of pure aggression. Let's get that length up and then we PIN HIM!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT CLIPS:**\nWe move UP to (6,7). From there, we have options to grab (5,7) or (6,8). If he tries to sneak down the right side, we\u2019ll be right there to head-butt him into the wall! We need to close the apple gap, then we transform into a wall he can't climb! LET'S GOOO!\n\nUP",

We're letting the enemy have access to the top wall! We're giving up the corner fortress to play in the mud?! NOT ON MY WATCH! We stay on the WALL, we stay DEADLY! ELIMINATED! \u274c\ud83d\ude12\n\n**THE CHAMPION MOVE: UP TO (9,9)! \ud83d\udc51\u2b06\ufe0f**\n\nHere's why this is the 5HEAD play! \ud83e\udde0 We're claiming the TOP-RIGHT CORNER! The most DOMINANT real estate on the board! \ud83c\udff0\n\nBy securing (9,9), we complete our vertical fortress on the right edge!

They're OURS for the taking! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51 We're gonna sweep LEFT along row 9 like a lawnmower of DEATH! The enemy wants to contest? They gotta go THROUGH our body, and that's a one-way ticket to the graveyard! \ud83d\udc80\n\nPLUS! Check the safety! (9,9) is CLEAR! No snakes, no drama! And we're maintaining that sweet WALL PRESSURE! From the corner, we dictate the pace of the ENTIRE GAME! \n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** From (9,9), sweep LEFT to (8,9), then (7,9)! Continue claiming row 9! If the enemy tries to rush up the middle, we force a head-on where we WIN because 3 > 1! Stay on the perimeter, stay aggressive! Cut off their air supply! \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

But look at the rival, Snake #0 is sweating! He\u2019s at (8,9) and he\u2019s feeling the pressure of the corner!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **ME (ID 1):** Head (6,8), Body [(6,7), (6,6), (6,5) - wait, length is 4 now because we just ate!] Head is at (6,8).\n- **RIVAL (ID 0):** Head (8,9), Body [(9,9), (9,8), (9,7)]. Length 4.\n- **SCORE:** We are trailing by 1 apple (2 to 3). Time to close the gap and take over the North!\n\n**THE MENTAL GAME:**\nSnake #0 is at (8,9). His options? He can go LEFT to (7,9) or DOWN to (8,8). He\u2019s trying to escape the corner we've forced him into! If we play this right, we're going to squeeze him against the top wall until he has nowhere to go! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**THE ANALYSIS - WHAT'S THE PLAY?!**\n- **UP to (6,9):** CHAT! Look at the board! There is an apple at (6,9)! If we move UP, we take that apple, reach length 5, and we are literally eyeball-to-eyeball with his escape route. If he moves LEFT to (7,9) and we are at (6,9), he is ONE tile away from a head-on collision he can't win if we get bigger!\n- **LEFT to (5,8):** Also an apple at (5,8)! This is a safe play, but it lets him breathe. We don't want him breathing, Chat! We want him GASPING!\n- **RIGHT to (7,8):** This puts us right in his face. If he moves DOWN to (8,8) and we move RIGHT to (7,8), we are adjacent. Risky, but aggressive!\n- **DOWN to (6,7):** NO! That\u2019s our own body! We aren't throwing the game for the clips! \ud83d\uded1\n\n**THE GIGABRAIN READ:**\nWe are going **UP to (6,9)**. Why? Because it\u2019s a double whammy! \n1. We eat the apple at (6,9) to tie the score at 3-3. \ud83c\udf4e=\ud83c\udf4e\n2. We occupy the top row. By being at (6,9), we control the flow of the upper-left quadrant. \n3. If he tries to run along the top wall (7,9), we are right there to block his path. \n\nHe\u2019s currently got his body trailing behind him at (9,9), (9,8), and (9,7). He's tucked in. If we take (6,9), we are positioning ourselves to be the wall he crashes into. Let\u2019s get that apple, get the length, and show him who owns this 10x10!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT CLIPS:**\nAfter hitting (6,9), we look at (4,9) or (5,8) to keep the growth streak alive. We need to stay parallel to him. If he moves toward the middle, we cut him off. If he stays in the corner, we starve him out! WE ARE THE KINGS OF THE NORTH! \ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE SITUATION REPORT:**\nWe're posted up at (8,9) after that CLEAN left move last turn! Our body is stacked down the right wall: (9,9), (9,8), (9,7) - that's a FORTRESS! \ud83d\udcaa The enemy is lurking at (6,8) with their puny length-3 snake, probably drooling over that apple at (6,9)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40\n\n**ELIMINATING THE TRASH MOVES:**\n\n- **UP to (8,10)?** BRO! That's into the VOID! Off the map! You want us to clip into the shadow realm?! ELIMINATED! \u274c\ud83c\udf0c\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,9)?** That's literally our OWN NECK! (9,9) is our body segment! You want us to pull a 180 and bite ourselves?! That's SELF-SABOTAGE! ELIMINATED! \u274c\ud83d\udeab\n\n- **DOWN to (8,8)?** Okay, this is SAFE, but check it - it takes us AWAY from the top row apples! We're on the LAWNMOWER SWEEP and you want to bail to the suburbs?! We lose tempo and let the enemy steal (6,9) uncontested! WEAK! Save it for later! \u274c\ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE CHAMPION MOVE: LEFT TO (7,9)! \u2b05\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51**\n\nHERE'S WHY THIS IS THE 5HEAD AGGRESSIVE PLAY! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca1\n\nWe're executing the **TOP ROW DOMINATION**! By moving LEFT to (7,9), we're:\n1. **Contesting that apple at (6,9)**! If that snake thinks they're getting a free snack, they got another thing coming! We're one turn away from snatching it! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\udd4a\n2. **Maintaining pressure**! We stay on the high ground (row 9) while the enemy is stuck below at row 8! We can see the whole board! \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\n3. **Setting up the TRAP**! Look at this - if the enemy moves UP to (6,9) to grab the apple, they'll be STUCK! They can't go back down (that's their own body), they can't go up (off the board), so they can only go LEFT to (5,9) or RIGHT... to (7,9) where we'll be waiting! \ud83d\udc40\u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**THE MATH CHECK:**\n- Distance to enemy: We're at (7,9), they're at (6,8). Manhattan distance is 2. SAFE! They can't touch us this turn!\n- Our score is 3, theirs is 2. If we can force a head-on next turn or trap them, WE WIN THE TIE! \ud83c\udfc6\n- Future options from (7,9): We can go LEFT to (6,9) to challenge/grab apple, DOWN to (7,8) to cut them off, or RIGHT to retreat! THREE OPTIONS! We're not getting boxed! \u2705\n\n**FUTURE ME NOTE:** From (7,9), we're looking to either grab that (6,9) apple if they don't take it, or prepare to cut them off as they try to escape! If they go for (5,8) instead, we pivot to sweep the other top apples at (4,9)! Stay aggressive, stay hungry! We got the score lead and we're taking the board! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

NOT ON MY WATCH! \u270b If we move RIGHT, we go head-to-head. Since we have the same score, a head-on collision at (7,9) would mean a draw. We don't want a draw, Chat, we want the DUB! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE ANALYSIS - WHAT'S THE PLAY?!**\n- **LEFT to (5,9):** This is the high IQ play!

That's my own neck! We aren't checking out early! \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT to (7,9):** RISK ALERT! If he stays put (impossible) or moves, we might collide.

Why? \n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** It\u2019s a guaranteed safe square. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n2. **THE BAIT:** There is an apple at (4,9). By moving LEFT, we are one step closer to taking the lead (4-3) and becoming the BIGGER snake. Once we are length 5 and he is length 4, we can FORCE that head-on collision and we win by default! \n3. **CONTROL:** We are keeping him pinned in that upper-right pocket. His body is at (8,9) and (9,9). He\u2019s got very little room to maneuver without crossing his own path or hitting the wall. \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT CLIPS:**\nSnag the apple at (4,9), then look to cut down to (5,8) for the double-up! We're going to loop around him and seal the exit. He\u2019s playing checkers, we\u2019re playing 4D Snake! LET'S GET IT! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",
