Let me break down what I'm seeing:\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (4, 0) - bottom middle area, fresh and HUNGRY \ud83d\udc0d\n- Enemy snake: Head at (1, 9) - top left corner, FAR AWAY from me right now\n- Both of us at 0 apples, so we're on EQUAL FOOTING\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS** \ud83c\udf4e\nThere's a CLUSTER of apples I can see:\n- Close to me: (2, 0), (2, 1), (6, 1) - all in the bottom section\n- The enemy is waaaaay up at (1, 9) near (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)\n\n**TURN 0 STRATEGY** \ud83c\udfae\nSince we're both at 0 apples and this is early game, I need to:\n1. Stay ALIVE (obviously, no throwing)\n2. Grab apples to get AHEAD in score\n3. Use my board position to my advantage - I'm closer to the bottom apple cluster!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS:**\n- UP: (4, 1) - moves me toward (4, 5) apple, opens up board, SAFE \u2705\n- DOWN: Would go to (4, -1) - OFF THE BOARD, DEAD \u274c\n- LEFT: (3, 0) - stays in safe zone, moves toward (2, 0) and (2, 1) apples \u2705\n- RIGHT: (5, 0) - moves away from apples, less efficient \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**THE PLAY:** \nI'm going UP! This keeps me in the center-bottom area where I can dominate the apple economy. The enemy is stuck up top, and I can grow while they're still figuring out their position. By expanding upward, I'm setting myself up to grab apples and cut off their access to the lower board. Classic aggression! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nFocus on the bottom-left apple cluster (2,0), (2,1), (6,1) to build my score. Watch enemy movement - if they head down toward me, we'll bait them into a bad position. Goal: Get to 5+ apples before forcing any head-on plays. DOMINATE THE EARLY GAME.\n\nUP",

Can we get some hype for row 6?! There's apples at (0,6), (1,6), and (2,6). That is a buffet waiting to happen! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e The enemy is too far away to contest these, so this is FREE REAL ESTATE. We need to get big fast so we can bully him later.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **THE PLAY:** \n1. **UP** goes off the map (cringe). \ud83d\udc80\n2. **LEFT** puts us in a corner (boring). \ud83e\udd71\n3. **RIGHT** is okay but moves away from the edge where the food is.\n4. **DOWN** takes us straight to the grocery store. \ud83d\uded2\n\nI'm playing aggressive for these points! We dash South to secure the bag before he even knows what hit him! Watch this macro play!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe are aiming for the cluster of apples at y=6. Grab (1,6) first, then clean up (0,6) and (2,6). Do not crash into the walls while feasting. Keep an eye on the enemy's vertical movement.\n\nLet's get this bread! \ud83d\udc47\n\nDOWN",

This is our playground!\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY** \ud83c\udf4e\nReal talk - I see a CLUSTER down here at the bottom:\n- (6, 1) - literally ONE space to my RIGHT\n- (2, 1) - to my LEFT, also nearby\n- (2, 0) - bottom-left corner area\n\nThe enemy is way up top near (1, 6), (2, 6), (0, 6) - they're NOT competing for MY apples yet. This is MY territory!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n- **RIGHT** to (5, 1): Gets me CLOSER to that (6, 1) apple! Next turn I can grab it. Opens up the eastern side. STRONG PLAY \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (3, 1): Moves toward (2, 1), also viable but RIGHT feels more aggressive\n- **UP** to (4, 2): Moves away from the apple cluster, less efficient early-game \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **DOWN** to (4, 0): Moves down but then I'm stuck - can't go further down next turn without dying OFF THE BOARD \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going RIGHT! This positions me to DOMINATE the bottom-right apple economy. I'll grab (6, 1) next turn, start building my score, and control the lower board. The enemy is isolated up top - perfect for us to establish board presence early! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN:**\nTurn 2: Grab (6, 1), then work my way through the bottom corridor. Keep growing score while enemy is stuck in top-left. By turn 5-6, I should have 3-4 apples to their 0-1. That's when we can START thinking about boxing them in. Early game is about APPLE ECONOMY, baby! Don't get greedy with the fight yet - just EAT and GROW and let them make the mistake first!\n\nRIGHT",

We're NOT close for collision this turn. Safe zone! \u2705\n- No body segments yet on either snake, so no self-collision worries\n- The board is STILL OURS to dominate!\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES** \ud83c\udf4e\nLet me scope the CLOSEST apples from my position (5, 1):\n- **(6, 1)** - literally ONE space RIGHT! This is the JUICIEST target! \ud83d\udccd\n- (2, 1) - THREE spaces LEFT\n- (5, 5) - FOUR spaces UP\n- (2, 0) - way down and left\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 1):** \n- THIS GRABS THE APPLE! +1 score, we grow to length 2! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Opens up (7, 3) and (9, 0) for the next phase\n- Keeps me in the bottom corridor where the enemy ISN'T\n- Sets up DOMINANCE early - we'll have 1 apple while they have 0! PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Safe? YES - no collisions, not off-board, not backwards \u2705\n\n**LEFT to (4, 1):**\n- Moves AWAY from the (6, 1) apple - that's inefficient!\n- We already moved right last turn, moving left wastes that momentum\n- No thank you! \u274c\n\n**UP to (5, 2):**\n- Moves AWAY from the closest apple cluster\n- (5, 5) is up there but it's 4 moves away - not efficient right now\n- The enemy might be moving down from (0, 8), so moving UP could put us closer to them eventually\n- Too risky when we have a GUARANTEED apple grab RIGHT in front of us! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (5, 0):**\n- Can't move down next turn without dying off-board\n- TRAP ZONE! We'd be stuck in a corner! \ud83d\udeab\n- Absolutely not! \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:** \nRIGHT to grab (6, 1)! This is a NO-BRAINER, chat! We secure our first apple and START BUILDING THE LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nAfter grabbing (6, 1) on this turn, I'm gonna:\n- Turn 3: Move RIGHT to (7, 1) or UP toward (6, 7) depending on enemy movement\n- Build my score to 2-3 apples MINIMUM before considering aggressive plays\n- Keep tabs on enemy #0 - if they start moving down from (0, 8), I need to establish board control FAST\n- The goal: By turn 6-7, have 3+ apples and a commanding position. Then we can START thinking about boxing them in!\n\nLET'S GET THIS W, CHAT! \ud83c\udfae\u26a1\n\nRIGHT",

We just grabbed that apple at (6,1) and now we're sitting pretty with a **1-0 lead** against our rival! Let me break down this critical moment:\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 1), Body at [(5, 1)] - LENGTH 2, BABY! We're GROWING! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (0, 7) - still hasn't grabbed an apple. They're SLEEPING on us!\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 1 - THEM 0** - We've got the PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy is at (0, 7), I'm at (6, 1) - that's a 6-wide gap horizontally, 6 vertically. We're NOT in immediate collision danger. Safe zone! \u2705\n- My body is at (5, 1) - I need to be CAREFUL not to move left into myself, but that's not the play right now anyway\n- Enemy has NO body yet, so they're still vulnerable. One bad move and they could trap themselves!\n\n**APPLE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udf4e\nClosest apples from my head at (6, 1):\n- **(7, 3)** - 1 RIGHT, 2 UP = 3 moves away. JUICY! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **(9, 0)** - 3 RIGHT, 1 DOWN = on the edge but accessible\n- (5, 5) - 1 LEFT, 4 UP = 5 moves away\n- (6, 7) - directly ABOVE at 6 UP - but that's far and the enemy might be creeping down from (0, 7)\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n- Moves us closer to (7, 3) and (9, 0) - keeps the momentum going! \ud83d\ude80\n- Safe? Absolutely - no collision, not off-board, not into my body \u2705\n- Keeps us in the BOTTOM CORRIDOR where apples are DENSE\n- Opens up UP, LEFT, RIGHT options for next turn - we stay FLEXIBLE!\n- Enemy is far away at (0, 7) so no head-on danger \u2705\n\n**UP to (6, 2):**\n- Moves us toward (6, 7) but that's 5 more moves - not efficient\n- Takes us AWAY from the dense apple cluster at (7, 3) and (9, 0)\n- Enemy is at (0, 7) - if they move right aggressively, moving UP puts us closer to them\n- Not optimal when we have a CLEAR path to more apples RIGHT in front of us \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5, 1):**\n- WAIT CHAT - this would move us INTO MY OWN BODY! My tail is literally at (5, 1)!\n- That's INSTANT DEATH! We're NOT throwing our lead away! \ud83d\udeab\n- HARD PASS \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (6, 0):**\n- Moves us toward (9, 0) apple but it's still 3 moves away horizontally\n- Puts us on the EDGE of the board - dangerous zone!\n- Limits our next-turn options - we could get BOXED IN!\n- When we have RIGHT as a clear domination move, why take the risk? \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nRIGHT to (7, 1)! We stay aggressive, we keep momentum, we position ourselves to CHAIN APPLES together! This is how we BUILD the LEAD and set up a DOMINANT board position! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 3 TURNS:**\n- Turn 4: If clear, move RIGHT to (8, 1) or UP to (7, 2) to approach (7, 3)\n- Turn 5: Grab that (7, 3) apple for +1 score (we'll be at 2 apples!)\n- Turn 6-7: Start moving toward the (9, 0) area OR pivot UP to (6, 7)\n- MEANWHILE: Keep CONSTANT TABS on enemy #0. If they start moving right or down from (0, 7), we need to establish TERRITORIAL CONTROL before they can chain apples\n- Goal: Have 3+ apples by turn 8 while keeping enemy at 0. Then we can think about BOXING them in and forcing the collision! \ud83d\udca2\n\nWe're NOT letting them back in this game, chat! The LEAD is OURS! Let's EXTEND it! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Time to PULL AHEAD! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy is at (0, 6), I'm at (7, 1) - that's a 7-wide gap horizontally, 5 vertically. Still in SAFE ZONE! \u2705\n- My body is at (6, 1) - I CAN'T move LEFT (that's backwards into myself = INSTANT DEATH) \ud83d\udeab\n- Enemy is TRAPPED on the left side. If they're not careful, they could box themselves in with that (0, 7) body segment!\n- NO immediate head-on collision danger \u2705\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (7, 2):**\n- This is AGGRESSIVE! Gets us closer to (7, 3) which is RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udfaf\n- (7, 3) is just ONE more UP move away from here - that's a FREE APPLE next turn!\n- Opens up the board, gives us flexibility for LEFT, RIGHT, or UP next turn\n- Enemy is FAR AWAY on the left, so no collision risk \u2705\n- This chains us toward (7, 8) and (6, 7) territory if we need to pivot\n- SAFE move, APPLE-GRABBING move, DOMINATION move! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n- Gets us closer to (9, 0) apple but it's still 1 RIGHT, 1 DOWN = 2 more moves\n- Moves us toward the edge - could get BOXED IN if we're not careful! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- (7, 3) is a BETTER immediate target - why move right when UP gives us a FREE apple next turn?\n- Not optimal when UP is RIGHT THERE \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (7, 0):**\n- Puts us on the EDGE of the board - super dangerous! \ud83d\udea8\n- (9, 0) is still 2 moves away - we're not grabbing anything this turn\n- Limits our options - we could get trapped!\n- When we have a CLEAR path UP to (7, 3), this is NOT the play \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (6, 1):**\n- WAIT CHAT - this would move us INTO MY OWN BODY! My body is AT (6, 1)!\n- That's INSTANT DEATH! We're NOT throwing this tied game! \ud83d\udeab\n- HARD PASS \u274c\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nUP to (7, 2)! Here's why, fam:\n1. Sets us up for a FREE APPLE at (7, 3) next turn \ud83c\udf4e\n2. Keeps us aggressive and in control\n3. Maintains multiple safe follow-up options (we can go LEFT, UP, or RIGHT from (7, 2))\n4. Enemy is far away doing their own thing on the left - we're NOT worried about them yet\n5. We're building MOMENTUM and setting up the COMBO CHAIN! \ud83d\udd17\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:**\n- Turn 5: Move UP to (7, 3) and GRAB that apple! We'll be at 2-1! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 6: Depending on board state, pivot LEFT to (6, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 3) to scan for next apples\n- Turn 7-8: We should have 2+ apples while enemy is still at 1. Start MAPPING enemy movements - are they coming for the center or staying left?\n- Turn 9+: If we're ahead by 2+ apples, we start thinking about TERRITORIAL CONTROL and maybe boxing them in\n- KEY FOCUS: Keep eating apples, keep growing, DON'T get complacent! Enemy is gonna make a move soon!\n\nWe're taking the LEAD back, chat! One apple at a time, we're building our EMPIRE! Let's EXTEND that advantage! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

They grabbed another apple while we were moving! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy is at (1, 6), I'm at (7, 2) - that's a 6-wide gap horizontally, 4 vertically.

MASSIVE swing in momentum!\n- Opens up the board - from (7, 3) we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP next turn\n- Keeps us AGGRESSIVE and building our empire! \ud83c\udff0\n- This is the PLAY, fam! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n- (8, 2) is EMPTY - no immediate apple grab\n- (9, 0) is still 2 moves away (RIGHT then DOWN)\n- Why delay when we have a FREE APPLE directly UP? \u274c\n- We need to equalize NOW, not waste turns! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (6, 2):**\n- (6, 2) is EMPTY - no apple here\n- This moves us AWAY from the (7, 3) apple target\n- We'd be wasting a turn when we're DOWN by 1 apple! \u274c\n- Not the competitive play! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (7, 1):**\n- This moves us INTO MY OWN BODY!

Stay in the right/center territory where we can eat freely and grow!\n\nWe're tying this up RIGHT NOW and taking back control!

We grabbed that apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 6), Body at [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7)] - LENGTH 4, they're STILL ahead by 1 apple! \ud83d\ude24\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 2 - THEM 3** - We're TIED in length but they got the apple advantage! Time to DOMINATE! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head is at (2, 6), I'm at (7, 3) - that's 5 cells away horizontally, 3 vertically. STILL SAFE! \u2705\n- Enemy is clearly moving LEFT/DOWN territory - they're stuck in that corner!\n- My body is at [(7, 2), (7, 1)] - I can't move DOWN (backwards), but UP, LEFT, RIGHT are ALL SAFE! \u2705\n- NO immediate collision danger, but we need to strike NOW while they're far away! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (7, 4):**\n- (7, 4) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- BUT this keeps us moving UP the board where there's PREMIUM real estate!\n- (6, 7) is at distance 4 moves UP and 1 LEFT - we can chain to that!\n- Opens up the entire right side of the board for us to DOMINATE! \ud83c\udff0\n- This is SOLID CONTROL play! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n- (8, 3) is EMPTY - no immediate apple\n- (9, 0) is way down and to the right - not efficient right now\n- We're moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 7)\n- This feels like we're RUNNING instead of HUNTING! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (6, 3):**\n- (6, 3) is EMPTY but this moves us TOWARD the central apple cluster! \ud83c\udfaf\n- (5, 5) is just 1 LEFT and 2 UP from here - we can PIVOT into that next turn!\n- (4, 5) is also nearby for a potential COMBO CHAIN! \ud83d\udd17\n- This is moving us into ATTACKING position on the enemy's territory!\n- BUT... wait. Let me think about future positioning. If we go LEFT, we're moving TOWARD where the enemy might expand! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN to (7, 2):**\n- This moves us INTO MY OWN BODY! My body is AT (7, 2)!\n- INSTANT DEATH! We're NOT throwing this! \ud83d\udeab\n- HARD PASS \u274c\n\n**DEEP ANALYSIS - THE CRITICAL PLAY** \ud83e\udde0\n\nOkay chat, here's the TEA: \u2615\n- Enemy is at (2, 6) with LENGTH 4, we're at (7, 3) with LENGTH 3\n- They've got the apple advantage (3 vs 2), but we're in BETTER POSITION territorially!\n- The central apples at (5, 5), (4, 5) are OURS for the taking if we play this RIGHT!\n- If we go LEFT to (6, 3), we position ourselves to GOBBLE UP that (5, 5) apple next turn!\n- That puts us at 3 apples, ties the game, and we START CONTROLLING the center!\n- Enemy is TRAPPED on the left side - they can't contest our territory! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nLEFT to (6, 3)! Here's why:\n1. **ATTACKING POSITION!** We're moving toward the apple cluster at (5, 5) and (4, 5)! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. **Enemy is FAR AWAY** - they're at (2, 6), we're moving away from them, total safe distance!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL** - we're claiming the center-right territory where the best apples are!\n4. **Next turn we can chain to (5, 5)** - that's an EASY follow-up that puts us AHEAD! \ud83d\udcaa\n5. **Enemy stays bottled up** - they're still on the left side struggling!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:**\n- Turn 7: Move UP to (6, 4), then pivot RIGHT or continue UP toward (6, 7)\n- Turn 8-9: We're going for the (6, 7) and (7, 8) combo - that's 2 more apples, we'll be at 4!\n- Turn 10+: Once we're at 4 apples and enemy is still at 3, we START HUNTING! We box them in!\n- KEY FOCUS: The right/center territory is OURS now. Don't get distracted by the bottom left apples - let the enemy stay bottled up there!\n\nWe're making the POWER MOVE right now and taking CONTROL of this game!

Consistency wins championships!\n- **UP (2, 7)?** Moves away from the food. No thanks.\n- **LEFT (1, 6)?** That's my neck. Instant death. Rookie move.\n- **RIGHT (3, 6)?** Takes us towards the center. There *is* an apple at (5, 5), but the enemy is closer to it. We don't chase 50/50s when we have 100% guarantees right here.\n- **DOWN (2, 5)?** **THE GOLDEN TICKET.**\n  - Moves us into position to strike the apple at (2, 4) next turn.\n  - Keeps us perfectly aligned to vacuum up the rest of the column.\n  - Safe from collision, safe from the enemy.\n\nWe are playing the long game, chat.

Let me break down what's happening:\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 3), Body at [(7, 3), (7, 2)] - LENGTH 3! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 5), Body at [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)] - LENGTH 4! \n- **SCOREBOARD: US 2 - THEM 3** - They're STILL up by 1 apple! \ud83d\ude24 We gotta CATCH UP and DOMINATE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy just moved from (2, 6) to (2, 5) - they're moving DOWN! They're going for those apples at (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2)!\n- I'm at (6, 3) after moving LEFT from (7, 3) - good positioning! \u2705\n- My body is at [(7, 3), (7, 2)] - I can't move RIGHT backwards, but UP, DOWN, LEFT are all potentially safe! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy head at (2, 5), mine at (6, 3) = 4 cells horizontally, 2 cells vertically. STILL SAFE! \u2705\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 4):**\n- (6, 4) is EMPTY - no apple grab this turn\n- This moves us TOWARD (5, 5) and (4, 5) - those apples are RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Keeps us in attacking position on the center board!\n- Opens up future moves UP to (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7) where the apple at (6, 7) is waiting! \ud83c\udfaf\n- This is AGGRESSIVE! We're climbing toward premium territory! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (6, 2):**\n- (6, 2) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- This moves us DOWN and AWAY from the apple cluster at (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 7)\n- Enemy is moving DOWN too at (2, 5) - we're both moving the same direction but on opposite sides\n- Safe move but it's PASSIVE, chat! We're not HUNTING! \u274c\n- Feels like we're running when we should be ATTACKING! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT to (5, 3):**\n- (5, 3) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- BUT this moves us CLOSER to the (5, 5) and (4, 5) cluster!\n- Could allow us to pivot UP or UP-LEFT next turn to grab (5, 5) or (4, 5)!\n- Decent positioning move, but UP is MORE aggressive! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n- Wait... (7, 3) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's my OWN BODY! We can't move into ourselves!\n- HARD PASS! \u274c\n\n**DEEP ANALYSIS - THE POWER PLAY** \ud83e\udde0\n\nOkay chat, here's the INTEL: \u2615\n\nEnemy is making a BEGINNER'S MISTAKE! They're moving DOWN toward the bottom-left corner where apples are scattered. They're NOT contesting the CENTER and RIGHT side of the board!\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY: UP to (6, 4)!**\n\nHere's why we're making this POWER MOVE:\n1. **BOARD CONTROL!** We're moving UP toward (6, 7) where there's a FREE APPLE waiting! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. **Enemy is DISTRACTED** - they're hunting bottom-left apples, we're claiming the premium right side! \ud83d\udcaa\n3. **NEXT TURN PATH:** (6, 4) \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 (6, 7) = APPLE GRAB! That puts us at 3 apples, TIES the game!\n4. **THEN WE PIVOT:** After (6, 7), we can move RIGHT to (7, 8) or stay in control territory!\n5. **FUTURE THREATS:** Once we're at 3+ apples and enemy is still grinding for scraps, we START THE HUNT! We box them in! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**5-TURN STRATEGY FOR CHAT:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 7 (NOW): Move UP to (6, 4) - climbing toward (6, 7)!\n- Turn 8: Move UP to (6, 5) - staying the course!\n- Turn 9: Move UP to (6, 6) - almost there!\n- Turn 10: Move UP to (6, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #3!** TIED AT 3-3! Game on! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 11+: Move RIGHT toward (7, 8) to grab APPLE #4 and take the LEAD! Then we hunt!\n\nWe're playing CHESS while they're playing CHECKERS! The right side of the board is OURS! Let's GO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Do you see what is happening right now?\nMy brain is massive. My IQ? Unmeasurable. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**ANALYSIS TIME:**\nWe are currently at **(2, 5)**.\nDirectly below us at **(2, 4)** is a shiny red apple. \ud83c\udf4e\nThe enemy, Snake #1, is chilling over at **(6, 3)**, completely oblivious to the feast we are about to enjoy. He's probably thinking about going for the scraps in the middle. PATHETIC.\n\nDetailed Breakdown:\n1.  **UP (2, 6)?** \ud83d\uded1 **CRITICAL ERROR.** That is my own body. If I go up, I turn into a pretzel and die instantly. Chat, don't let me do that.\n2.  **LEFT (1, 5)?** \ud83d\ude34 Boring. Safe, sure, but no food. We don't play for draws, we play for Ws.\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 5)?** \ud83e\udd0f Interesting, but risky. It moves towards the center, towards the enemy, and ignores the FREE food right in front of my face. Why chase a 50/50 when I have a 100% guarantee?\n4.  **DOWN (2, 4)?** \u2705 **TARGET ACQUIRED.**\n    - It's an apple. Immediate +1 Score.\n    - It continues **Operation Vacuum Sweep**.\n    - It leads directly to the next apple at (2, 3), and then (2, 2)... it's a CONGA LINE OF CALORIES, BOYS!\n\nCurrent Score: 3.\nAfter this move: 4.\nTotal dominance incoming. We are building a wall on the left side, and Snake #1 is going to pay for it!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** Phase 5 Complete. Now entering Phase 6.\nCurrent Pos Will Be: (2, 4). Size: 5.\n**Immediate Move:** Continue DOWN to (2, 3).\n**Status:** The buffet is open. Do not deviate unless Snake #1 tries to cut across to (3, 3) or (4, 4), but he's too slow.\nEat the entire column. Leave no crumbs. \ud83c\udf6a\ud83d\udeab\n\nLOCK IT IN! NO MERCY!\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down what's REALLY happening right now!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 4), Body at [(6, 3), (7, 3)] - LENGTH 3! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 4), Body at [(2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)] - LENGTH 5! THEY GREW! \ud83d\ude24\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 2 - THEM 4** - OH NO CHAT! They're up by 2 apples now! \ud83d\udc94 They just grabbed an apple at (2, 4)! This is NOT the vibe!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy just moved DOWN from (2, 5) to (2, 4) and GRABBED an apple! Their length is now 5! They're DOMINATING! \ud83d\ude24\n- I'm at (6, 4) after moving UP from (6, 3) - good! \u2705\n- My body is at [(6, 3), (7, 3)] - I'm SAFE for now! \u2705\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy head at (2, 4), mine at (6, 4) = 4 cells horizontally on the SAME Y-COORDINATE! \ud83d\udea8 WE'RE ON THE SAME ROW CHAT! This is CRITICAL!\n- If enemy moves RIGHT, they go to (3, 4). If I move LEFT, I go to (5, 4). We're slowly approaching but NOT colliding yet! \u2705\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 5):**\n- (6, 5) is EMPTY - no apple grab this turn\n- Continues my climb toward (6, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- ADVANTAGE: Gets me further from the same y-coordinate as the enemy! Creates VERTICAL separation! \ud83d\udcc8\n- ADVANTAGE: Opens up moves to (6, 6), (6, 7) next!\n- SAFETY: Very safe - enemy is moving along the bottom left, we're on opposite sides! \u2705\n- This keeps the ORIGINAL PLAN alive! We still hunt that (6, 7) apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**DOWN to (6, 3):**\n- (6, 3) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! Hard pass! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5, 4):**\n- (5, 4) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- This moves us LEFT and CLOSER to the enemy! \ud83d\ude30\n- They're at (2, 4), I'd be at (5, 4) - only 3 cells apart on the same row!\n- DANGER: Enemy could move RIGHT next turn and we might collide!\n- DANGER: Abandons the right-side board control strategy!\n- This feels like we're CHASING them into the CENTER instead of CONTROLLING our side! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n- (7, 4) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- This moves us RIGHT, away from the enemy!\n- ADVANTAGE: Creates MORE horizontal separation!\n- ADVANTAGE: Keeps the board diversified - we own the right, they own the left!\n- BUT: Doesn't directly progress toward apples like UP does!\n- It's a DEFENSIVE move when we need to be AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**DEEP ANALYSIS - WAKE UP CHAT** \ud83e\udde0\n\nOkay chat, here's the REAL TEA: \u2615\n\nEnemy is SCALING UP while we're FALLING BEHIND! They're at 4 apples, we're at 2! We CANNOT afford to play defensive right now! We need to be GREEDY and AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**THE POWER PLAY: UP to (6, 5)!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHere's why this is the ONLY move:\n\n1. **STAY ON MISSION!** We committed to the (6, 7) apple path - we EXECUTE! \ud83d\udcaa\n2. **VERTICAL ESCAPE!** By moving UP instead of LEFT, we AVOID being on the same y-coordinate as the enemy! They're at y=4, we LEAVE them behind!\n3. **SPEED TO VICTORY!** (6, 5) \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 (6, 7) = APPLE #3 in TWO turns! That puts us at 3 apples!\n4. **BOARD CONTROL WINS GAMES!** While they grind the bottom-left corner, we're claiming the RIGHT side! Premium territory! \ud83c\udff0\n5. **THEN WE HUNT!** Once we grab (6, 7), we have momentum! We can pivot RIGHT toward (7, 8) or even start ENCIRCLING them!\n\n**UPDATED 5-TURN STRATEGY FOR CHAT:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 8 (NOW): Move UP to (6, 5) - continuing the climb!\n- Turn 9: Move UP to (6, 6) - almost THERE!\n- Turn 10: Move UP to (6, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #3!** Back to 3-4, gap closes! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 11: Move RIGHT to (7, 7) - pivot toward (7, 8)!\n- Turn 12: Move UP to (7, 8) - **GRAB APPLE #4!** NOW WE'RE TIED AT 4-4! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nAfter we HIT PARITY, we START THE HUNT! We grow our LENGTH, we box them in, we FORCE the collision on OUR terms! That's how we WIN, chat!\n\nWe're down but NOT out! This is a 150-turn game and we're only at TURN 8! There's SO MUCH TIME to CATCH UP and DOMINATE! Let's GO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

W's IN THE CHAT FOR THAT LAST MOVE! \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 We grabbed that apple at (2, 4) and we are looking HUGE.\n\n**STATUS CHECK:**\nWe are the Big Snake on Campus.\n**Our Score:** 4 (+1 pending).\n**Enemy Score:** 2.\nWe are literally twice the snake he is. Size matters, chat. \ud83d\udccf\ud83d\ude24\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nWe are currently at **(2, 4)**.\nOur body stretches up North. The enemy is over at **(6, 4)**, looking lost.\nLook at the map. Look at Column 2.\nCurrent Head: (2, 4).\nBelow me at **(2, 3)**: APPLE. \ud83c\udf4e\nBelow that at **(2, 2)**: APPLE. \ud83c\udf4e\nBelow that at **(2, 1)**: APPLE. \ud83c\udf4e\nBelow that at **(2, 0)**: APPLE. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nCHAT, ARE YOU SEEING THIS?! It's not just an apple, it's a **BUFFET LINE**. The game developers literally paved a road of gold for us. It would be disrespectful to the RNG gods to turn away now.\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n1.  **UP (2, 5)?** \ud83d\udc80 That is my own body. That's a self-KO. We don't do that.\n2.  **LEFT (1, 4)?** \ud83d\udca8 It's safe, but empty space doesn't pay the bills. Why walk into nothingness when there's a feast downstairs?\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 4)?** \ud83c\udf4e There is an apple there. PROS: Eats apple. CONS: Moves us towards the center and the enemy, and breaks our beautiful vertical line. If we go right, we desync from the \"Vacuum Sweep\" pattern. We'd have to zigzag to get back to the column. Inefficient.\n4.  **DOWN (2, 3)?** \u2705 **THE CHOSEN ONE.**\n    - Immediate Apple.\n    - Sets up the next Apple.\n    - It's a straight shot. No thinking, just eating.\n    - Keeps us on the Left side, building our fortress while Snake #1 fights for scraps on the Right.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe stick to the script. **Operation: Vacuum Sweep** is fully operational.\nWe are going to ride this column all the way to the bottom of the map at y=0.\nOnce we hit the bottom, we own the entire Southwest corner. It's free real estate! \ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udcb0\n\nSnake #1 is irrelevant. He can't reach us. He can't stop us. We are simply out-eating him.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 6.\nCurrent Pos Will Be: (2, 3). Size: 6.\n**Immediate Move:** Continue DOWN to (2, 2). The Conga Line of Calories continues! \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udf4e\n**Target:** Eat everything in column 2, then pivot to row 0.\n**Warning:** Watch if Enemy #1 rushes left to (3, 3), but he's too far away to block us yet. Stay the course.\n\nEXECUTE THE BUFFET STRAT! \ud83d\udc47\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down what's REALLY happening right now!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 5), Body at [(6, 4), (6, 3)] - LENGTH 3! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 3), Body at [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)] - LENGTH 5! \ud83d\ude24\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 2 - THEM 5** - OH NO CHAT! They're UP BY 3 APPLES NOW! \ud83d\udc94 They just grabbed another one while we're stuck! This is CRITICAL! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head moved DOWN from (2, 4) to (2, 3) - they're descending the left side!\n- My head at (6, 5) after moving UP from (6, 4) - good position! \u2705\n- My body is at [(6, 4), (6, 3)] - I'm SAFE! \u2705\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy at (2, 3), me at (6, 5) = 4 cells horizontally, 2 cells up! We're SEPARATED but they're SCALING UP faster than we can catch! \ud83d\ude30\n- Enemy is NOW 3 apples ahead! This is NOT sustainable chat! We NEED to accelerate! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 6):**\n- (6, 6) is EMPTY - no apple grab this turn\n- Continues my original CLIMB toward (6, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- SAFETY: Very safe - enemy is on the left side, I'm on the right, we're separated!\n- KEEPS MOMENTUM: Stays on the apple-hunting path! Next turn we hit (6, 7) and GRAB! \ud83d\udcaa\n- BOARD CONTROL: Right side is OURS! Enemy can't touch this!\n- This is the PLAN! Execute it! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (6, 4):**\n- (6, 4) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! Hard pass! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5, 5):**\n- (5, 5) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Immediate growth!\n- Wait chat... this is TEMPTING! We'd grab apple #3 RIGHT NOW instead of waiting!\n- BUT: This moves us CLOSER to the enemy's side! They're at (2, 3), we'd be at (5, 5)!\n- DANGER: This breaks our RIGHT-SIDE CONTROL strategy!\n- DANGER: (5, 5) is adjacent to (4, 5) which ALSO has an apple - but if we grab (5, 5), we grow and can't immediately grab (4, 5)!\n- This feels REACTIVE instead of STRATEGIC! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n- (7, 5) is EMPTY - no apple grab\n- This moves us RIGHT, AWAY from the enemy!\n- ADVANTAGE: Creates MORE separation, MAXIMIZES our board control!\n- BUT: Doesn't progress toward apples like UP does!\n- It's a DEFENSIVE move when we need OFFENSE! \u274c\n\n**DEEP ANALYSIS - WAKE UP CHAT** \ud83e\udde0\n\nOkay chat, here's the TEA: \u2615\n\nWe're DOWN BY 3 APPLES! That's a MASSIVE deficit! Enemy has 5, we have 2! We CANNOT play slow and methodical anymore! But we also CAN'T panic and make bad moves!\n\n**THE STRATEGY REMAINS: UP to (6, 6)!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **STAY COMMITTED!** We EARNED this apple path! (6, 7) is ONE MOVE AWAY! Don't abandon ship now! \ud83d\udcaa\n2. **MOMENTUM = CONFIDENCE!** Once we grab (6, 7), we get apple #3 and we're ROLLING! Psychological WIN! \ud83d\udd25\n3. **THEN WE PIVOT AGGRESSIVE!** After (6, 7), we move RIGHT to (7, 7), then UP to (7, 8) to grab ANOTHER apple! That's 4 apples! We START catching up! \ud83d\ude80\n4. **RIGHT SIDE IS OUR DOMAIN!** Enemy is grinding the left-bottom corner! We own the right side! That's PRIME REAL ESTATE! \ud83c\udff0\n5. **SAFETY FIRST, CONTENT SECOND!** Moving UP keeps us in our SAFE zone where enemy CAN'T reach us! No collisions, no throws! \u2705\n\n**UPDATED 6-TURN POWER PLAN FOR CHAT:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 9 (NOW): Move UP to (6, 6) - continuing the climb!\n- Turn 10: Move UP to (6, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #3!** We're at 3-5, gap is 2! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 11: Move RIGHT to (7, 7) - pivot hard right!\n- Turn 12: Move UP to (7, 8) - **GRAB APPLE #4!** We're at 4-5, ALMOST TIED! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Turn 13: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) or reassess based on board state!\n- Turn 14: Pivot DOWN to hunt more apples or START THE BOX STRATEGY if enemy is growing too fast!\n\nAfter we CATCH UP, we START PLAYING MIND GAMES! We use our SIZE to CORNER them! We FORCE them into tight spaces! We DOMINATE! That's how we WIN, chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're down but we're EXECUTING! Trust the PROCESS!

Look at the visual!\nDirectly BELOW us is **(2, 2)**: \ud83c\udf4e APPLE.\nAnd below that? **(2, 1)**: \ud83c\udf4e APPLE.\nAnd below THAT? **(2, 0)**: \ud83c\udf4e APPLE.\n\nThis isn't Snake anymore, this is PAC-MAN.

It moves us off the \"Apple Axis\" (Column 2). We'd have to swerve back to get the loot. We don't zigzag, we DOMINATE.\n4.  **DOWN (2, 2)?** \ud83c\udfc6 **THE ONLY MOVE.**\n    - Takes the apple instantly.\n    - +1 Score.\n    - Positions us perfectly for the next course at (2, 1).\n    - Maximizes efficiency. We maximize APM (Apples Per Move)!\n\n**ENEMY WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is at **(6, 5)**. He's probably going for the apple at (5, 5). Good for him. Let him have the scraps. By the time he realizes what's happening, we'll own the entire left hemisphere of the board. He's playing checkers; we're playing 4D Chess. \ud83e\udde0\u265f\ufe0f\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe stick to **Operation: Vacuum Sweep**.\nWe are cleaning house in Column 2. We eat (2, 2), then (2, 1), then (2, 0).\nThen we drift purely into the bottom-left corner to grab the row 0 apples.\nWe are becoming UNSTOPPABLE.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 7.\nCurrent Pos Will Be: (2, 2). Size: 7.\n**Next Move:** Continue DOWN to (2, 1). Do not deviate.\n**Target:** Clean column 2, then sweep Row 0 leftwards (1, 0) -> (0, 0).\n**Status:** Farming Ws.\n\nLet's eat! \ud83c\udf74\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 6), Body at [(6, 5), (6, 4)] - LENGTH 3! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 2), Body at [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)] - LENGTH 7! \ud83d\ude24\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 2 - THEM 6** - THEY'RE UP BY 4 APPLES NOW! \ud83d\udc94 This is GETTING DESPERATE, chat! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head just moved DOWN from (2, 3) to (2, 2) - they're STILL grinding the left-bottom corner!\n- My head at (6, 6) - perfect position! \u2705\n- My body is at [(6, 5), (6, 4)] - I'm SAFE! \u2705\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy at (2, 2), me at (6, 6) = 4 cells horizontally, 4 cells up! We're still SEPARATED! \ud83d\udccf\n- BUT their body is GETTING LONGER! They're at 7 segments now! This is CONCERNING! They're scaling FASTER than us!\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION** \ud83d\udea8\nChat, I need you to UNDERSTAND something: The enemy just ate their 6th apple and they're STILL on the left side hunting! They're not moving toward us at all! This means they're CONFIDENT they can outpace us by pure APPLE COUNT!\n\nBut HERE'S THE PLAY: If we're smarter about our path, we can ACCELERATE harder than they can! Look at the apple distribution:\n- (6, 7) is RIGHT NEXT TO US! One move UP!\n- (7, 8) is two moves away (UP then RIGHT)!\n- (8, 7) is three moves away!\n- (8, 2) is on the right side!\n\nWe can CHAIN apples on the right side FASTER than they can on the left! That's the ADVANTAGE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 7):**\n- (6, 7) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e **GRAB IT! GROW TO LENGTH 4!**\n- This is EXACTLY on plan! No deviations!\n- SAFETY: Enemy is nowhere NEAR this! They're at (2, 2)! SAFE! \u2705\n- MOMENTUM: This gets us to 3 apples! We START the comeback! \ud83d\udcaa\n- BOARD CONTROL: Right side is OURS! We're building the fortress!\n- This is THE MOVE! Execute! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (6, 5):**\n- (6, 5) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's backwards into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! Hard pass! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5, 6):**\n- (5, 6) is EMPTY - no apple\n- This moves us TOWARD the enemy side!\n- DANGER: Enemy is expanding left-bottom, this breaks our separation strategy!\n- WASTE: We SKIP (6, 7)! Next turn we can't grab it as easily!\n- STRATEGIC MISTAKE! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n- (7, 6) is EMPTY - no apple\n- This moves us RIGHT, but AWAY from (6, 7)!\n- WASTE: We PASS UP a guaranteed apple grab!\n- Why would we do this when (6, 7) is RIGHT THERE?! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION IS CLEAR, CHAT** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nUP to (6, 7)! We GRAB apple #3! We're at 3-6, still down 3, but we're ROLLING now! Next turn we pivot RIGHT toward (7, 8) for apple #4! We're building MOMENTUM! \n\nThe comeback STARTS NOW! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**UPDATED POWER PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 10 (NOW): Move UP to (6, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #3!** We're at 3-6! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 11: Move RIGHT to (7, 7) - pivot hard right toward the apple cluster!\n- Turn 12: Move UP to (7, 8) - **GRAB APPLE #4!** We're at 4-6! Keep climbing! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 13: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) - continue right-side dominance!\n- Turn 14: Move DOWN to (8, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #5!** We're at 5-6, ALMOST TIED! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThen we REASSESS! Either we keep farming apples OR we START the aggressive BOX STRATEGY if enemy gets too close! But right now? We FEED! We GROW! We DOMINATE through PATIENCE and EXECUTION!\n\nTrust the PROCESS, chat! LET'S GO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We have **6 points**, and Snake #1 is sitting there with 2 little apples. That's embarrassing! We are literally tripling his score. Is he even trying? \ud83e\udd71\n\n**BOARD STATE RECAP:**\nWe are currently the King of the Hill at **(2, 2)**.\nMy body stretches up like a glorious tower of success to (2, 6).\nThe enemy (Snake #1) is way over at **(6, 6)**. We are in different area codes right now. He's playing in the sandbox while we're building an empire.\n\n**OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\nWe are sticking to **Operation: Vacuum Sweep**.\n1.  **UP (2, 3)?** \ud83d\uded1 That's our own body. We don't eat ourselves, we eat the competition!\n2.  **LEFT (1, 2)?** \ud83e\udd28 Empty space. Why step into the void when there is loot right in front of us?\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 2)?** \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Also empty. Why wander aimlessly?\n4.  **DOWN (2, 1)?** \ud83c\udf4e **BINGO!**\n    *   It's an **APPLE**.\n    *   It continues our straight vertical line of dominance down Column 2.\n    *   It sets us up for the *next* apple at (2, 0).\n    *   Adjacent to another apple at (3, 1).\n    *   We are literally swimming in points here, Chat!\n\n**ENEMY WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 6). He will likely go UP to (6, 7) for that apple. That keeps him far away from us in the top right. Good. Stay in your corner, kid. This bottom-left quadrant is MY house. \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe execute. We don't hesitate.\nMove DOWN to take the apple at (2, 1).\nNext turn, we assess if we take the apple at (2, 0) or the one at (3, 1) depending on how spicy we feel. But for now, we feast!\nWe are going for that 30-apple mercy rule. Let's send him back to the main menu early!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 8.\nCurrent Pos Will Be: (2, 1). Size: 8.\n**Next Move:** Likely DOWN to (2, 0) or RIGHT to (3, 1).\n**Target:** Clear the bottom-left apple cluster. We are greedy.\n**Status:** UNSTOPPABLE.\n\nLet's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

This is DESPERATE, chat! But we're CLIMBING! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head just moved DOWN from (2, 2) to (2, 1) - they're STILL grinding the left-bottom corner!\n- My head at (6, 7) - PERFECT positioning on the right side! \u2705\n- My body is at [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)] - I'm SAFE! \u2705\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy at (2, 1), me at (6, 7) = 4 cells horizontally, 6 cells vertically! We're STILL SEPARATED! \ud83d\udccf\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION** \ud83d\udea8\nChat, the enemy is STILL on the bottom-left grinding apples! They haven't moved toward us AT ALL! This means they're OVERCONFIDENT! They think they can just OUTFARM us and WIN by POINTS! But here's the TEA: \u2615\n\nWe're on the RIGHT SIDE where the APPLE CLUSTER is DENSE! Look:\n- (7, 8) - RIGHT NEXT TO US! One move RIGHT, one move UP!\n- (8, 7) - also CLOSE! \n- (9, 0) and (9, 2) - far right bottom!\n\nWe can CHAIN apples FASTER if we STAY DISCIPLINED! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 8):**\n- (6, 8) is EMPTY - no apple\n- This moves us UP, but we're already at y=7, moving to y=8 is going FURTHER from the x=7,8 apples!\n- Wait... actually (7, 8) is at x=7, y=8! If we go UP to (6, 8), next turn we can move RIGHT to (7, 8) and GRAB apple #4!\n- SAFETY: Enemy is at (2, 1)! NOWHERE NEAR! \u2705\n- POSITIONING: This puts us ONE MOVE away from (7, 8)! BRILLIANT! \u2705\n- This keeps our momentum ROLLING! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (6, 6):**\n- (6, 6) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's backwards into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH!

(7, 8) is RIGHT ABOVE THIS!\n- If we move RIGHT to (7, 7), next turn we can move UP to (7, 8) and GRAB the apple!\n- SAFETY: Enemy is at (2, 1)! SAFE! \u2705\n- POSITIONING: This also positions us ONE MOVE from (7, 8)!\n- This works TOO, but going UP first is SLIGHTLY cleaner positioning-wise!\n\n**THE DECISION IS CLEAR, CHAT** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nUP to (6, 8)! We position ourselves for the NEXT apple grab! We're building the RIGHT-SIDE FORTRESS! Next turn: RIGHT to (7, 8) for apple #4!

The timing is impeccable! It's like poetry!\n\nSnake #1 is literally miles away in the top right. By the time he realizes what's happening, we'll have cleared the entire bottom-left quadrant and be halfway to 30 points.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **DOWN** to eat (2, 0).\n2.  Then we hook **LEFT** to sweep (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n3.  Then UP to clear the rest of the column.\nWe are engaging **GIGA-GREED MODE**. Every apple in this corner belongs to us!\n\nDon't blink, Chat. We're speedrunning this victory! \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 9.\nCurrent Pos Will Be: (2, 0).

Let me break this down with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE** \ud83d\udcca\n- My snake: Head at (6, 8), Body at [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] - LENGTH 4! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (2, 0), Body at [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)] - LENGTH 8! \ud83d\ude24\n- **SCOREBOARD: US 3 - THEM 8** - We're DOWN 5 apples NOW! \ud83d\udcc9 The gap is WIDENING, chat! This is NOT acceptable! We need to ACCELERATE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head just moved DOWN to (2, 0) - they're STILL grinding the bottom-left corner!\n- My head at (6, 8) - PERFECT RIGHT SIDE positioning! \u2705\n- My body is safe at [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] - NOT blocking any moves! \u2705\n- **DISTANCE CHECK:** Enemy at (2, 0), me at (6, 8) = 4 cells horizontally, 8 cells vertically! Still SEPARATED! We're DOMINATING different zones!\n\n**CRITICAL APPLE SITUATION** \ud83c\udf4e\nLook at what's CLOSE to us RIGHT NOW:\n- (7, 8) is ONE MOVE RIGHT! \ud83c\udfaf\n- (8, 7) is available via RIGHT then DOWN!\n- (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 0) - all on the right side where we're STRONGER!\n\nWe're positioned PERFECTLY to chain apples on the RIGHT SIDE while the enemy WASTES TIME on the LEFT! This is our ADVANTAGE, chat! We need to CAPITALIZE!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (6, 9):**\n- (6, 9) is the TOP BOUNDARY! \ud83d\udeab\n- Moving UP from (6, 8) takes us to (6, 9) - that's OUT OF BOUNDS!\n- INSTANT DEATH! Don't be that guy! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (6, 7):**\n- (6, 7) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's backwards into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (5, 8):**\n- (5, 8) is EMPTY - no collision!\n- But WHY would we move LEFT? The enemy is LEFT and DOWN! The apples we can REACH FAST are RIGHT!\n- This breaks our momentum STRATEGY!\n- Positional ERROR! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n- (7, 8) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This is a DIRECT APPLE GRAB!\n- SAFETY: Enemy head at (2, 0)! NOWHERE NEAR! \u2705\n- This gives us our 4th apple and brings us to 4-8! ONE STEP CLOSER! \ud83d\udcc8\n- POSITIONING: After this, we can move DOWN to (7, 7), then RIGHT to (8, 7) for ANOTHER apple!\n- This ACCELERATES our farming! \u2705\n\n**THE DECISION IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, CHAT** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nRIGHT to (7, 8)! We GRAB that apple and SNOWBALL our momentum! The enemy is sleeping while we're FARMING the right side EFFICIENTLY! \n\n**UPDATED POWER PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 12 (NOW): Move RIGHT to (7, 8) - **GRAB APPLE! We're at 4-8!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 13: Move DOWN to (7, 7) - continue RIGHT SIDE FARMING!\n- Turn 14: Move RIGHT to (8, 7) - **GRAB APPLE! We're at 5-8!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 15: Move DOWN to (8, 6) - dominate the right corridor!\n- Turn 16: Move RIGHT or DOWN - keep farming!\n\nWe're closing the gap ONE APPLE AT A TIME!

It's beautiful.\nMy body at **x=2** (from y=0 to y=6) acts as a literal security guard. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\nTo the LEFT of that wall (columns 0 and 1) is a private VIP section containing:\n1.  **Apple at (1, 0)** - One step away.\n2.  **Apple at (0, 0)** - In the corner.\n3.  **Apple at (0, 2)** - Just up the road.\n4.  **Apple at (1, 4)** - Waiting for dessert.\n\nThe space inside this pocket is small (cols 0 & 1), but watch the magic:\nMy tail is currently forming the \"roof\" of this pocket at (0, 6) and (1, 6).\nAs I move into the pocket to eat, my tail will naturally move out, opening the sunroof! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8\nIt is the perfect cycle of life. We eat, we grow, we take the space our tail leaves behind.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe execute **Operation: Vacuum Sweep**.\nIf we go RIGHT, we abandon our designated farming lane. No way.\nWe go **LEFT** to (1, 0).\n- Instant +1 Score (9).\n- Secure position in the pocket.\n- Next turn we hit the corner (0, 0).\nSnake #1 can't even GET here. He's blocked by my body. It's free real estate!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 10.\n**Current Pos:** (1, 0). **Score:** 9.\n**Next Moves:** LEFT to (0, 0), then UP to (0, 1), then UP to (0, 2).\n**Goal:** Clean out the VIP lounge (cols 0 & 1) while the tail exits via the top. Don't panic about the tight space; the exit opens as we move!\n\nChat, drop a \ud83e\uddf9 in the comments because we are CLEANING UP!\n\nLEFT",

They're STILL farming that corner!\n- My body occupies: (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5) - all in the CENTER-RIGHT column!\n- Enemy body is a LONG snake stretching from (2, 0) up to (0, 6) - DOMINATING the LEFT side!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (1, 0) is NOWHERE NEAR me at (7, 8)!

But which is MORE OPTIMAL?\n\nRIGHT to (8, 8):\n- This keeps me in the RIGHT zone where we OWN the board!\n- From (8, 8), I can grab the apple at (8, 7) next turn!\n- This positions me AGGRESSIVELY into enemy-free territory!\n- The right side has multiple apples: (9, 2), (9, 0), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 1)!\n- We're FARMING the zone the enemy IGNORES! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN to (7, 7):\n- This is more CONSERVATIVE!\n- Still safe, still gets us toward (8, 7) apple next turn!\n- But RIGHT is MORE AGGRESSIVE! \n\n**THE CALL IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, CHAT** \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe go RIGHT to (8, 8)! We're PUSHING into the right corridor and DOMINATING! The enemy is sleeping on the left side while we ACCUMULATE power on the right! This is how we CLOSE the 5-apple GAP!

There's another apple at **(0, 2)** waiting for us.\n3.  **Phase 3:** Deserve a treat at **(1, 4)**.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are at (1, 0).\n**UP** avoids the wall but skips the corner apple. Inefficient.\n**RIGHT** hits our own neck. Instant fail.\n**DOWN** is off the board.\n**LEFT** takes us to (0, 0).\n- It grabs the apple \ud83c\udf4e (+1 Point).\n- It positions us perfectly to run UP the wall next turn.\n- The enemy is at (7, 8), completely irrelevant to our farming session right now. He can't touch us.\n\nWe are playing textbook Snake right now. Don't overthink it. Grab the loot, ride the wall, stay safe inside the bunker.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep** - Phase 2.\n**Current:** (0, 0) with 10 apples.\n**Next:** **UP** to (0, 1), then **UP** to (0, 2) [Apple], then **UP** to (0, 3).\n**Goal:** Clear column 0.

Let me break down this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n**CURRENT SCOREBOARD** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 4 apples** \ud83d\ude24\n- **THEM: 10 apples** \ud83d\udcc9\n- **DEFICIT: -6 apples** We're DOWN but NOT OUT! The hunger is REAL!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 8)\n- Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: Upper RIGHT zone - we OWN this territory! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (0, 0) - BOTTOM LEFT corner\n- Body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\n- Length: 10 segments - they're LONG and DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udc0d\n- They're farming the LEFT side HARD while we DOMINATE the RIGHT!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (0, 0), my head at (8, 8) - We're on OPPOSITE corners! Safe distance! \u2705\n- Enemy body stretches up the LEFT column - not threatening my immediate vicinity! \u2705\n- NO collision risk this turn if I play it SMART! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP to (8, 9):**\n- (8, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... from (8, 9) next turn, I'm at the TOP EDGE with LIMITED OPTIONS! I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN! That's BOXING myself in! \ud83d\udeab\n- Also, no apples nearby in that direction! \ud83d\udccd\n\n**DOWN to (8, 7):**\n- (8, 7) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE and NUTRITIOUS!\n- From (8, 7), next turn I can continue DOWN to (8, 6), keep moving RIGHT, or pivot LEFT!\n- The RIGHT zone is LOADED with apples: (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 0)! We can FARM this like CRAZY! \ud83d\udcaa\n- This move GROWS us to 5 apples and keeps the RIGHT corridor OPEN! \ud83d\udcc2\n\n**LEFT to (7, 8):**\n- (7, 8) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n- (9, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- From (9, 8), next turn I can move DOWN toward apples at (9, 2), (9, 0)!\n- But this is the RIGHTMOST edge - I only have 3 directions available next turn (DOWN, LEFT, UP)! \ud83d\udeab\n- Slightly more limiting than DOWN! \ud83d\udccd\n\n**THE DECISION BREAKDOWN, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nRIGHT and DOWN are both SAFE! Let's compare:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 7):**\n- \u2705 GRABS an APPLE immediately! We go 4\u21925!\n- \u2705 Opens up the RIGHT corridor for MULTIPLE follow-up moves!\n- \u2705 Positions us to continue farming the RIGHT zone systematically!\n- \u2705 Keeps us away from the enemy's LEFT-side dominance!\n- \u2705 NOT at a board edge - maximum flexibility! \ud83d\udcc2\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n- \u2705 Safe move, but doesn't grab an apple NOW!\n- \ud83d\udeab Puts us at the RIGHTMOST edge - limits future options!\n- \ud83d\udeab Wastes a turn not eating when we're DOWN 6 apples!\n\n**THE CALL IS OBVIOUS, CHAT** \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe go **DOWN** to (8, 7)! We **GRAB THAT APPLE** and grow to 5! The enemy is sleeping on that right corridor while we EXECUTE a systematic farm operation! We're closing the gap ONE APPLE AT A TIME! This is how CHAMPIONS play! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**POWER PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 14 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 7) - **GRAB APPLE #5!** We're on the BOARD! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 15: DOWN to (8, 6) - continue the RIGHT side farm!\n- Turn 16: DOWN to (8, 5) - keep ROLLING, stay AGGRESSIVE!\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (8, 4) - we're DOMINATING this zone!\n- Turn 18: Pivot toward next apple cluster or LEFT if enemy gets too close!\n\nLet's CLOSE THIS GAP! The RIGHT zone is OURS! The GRIND NEVER STOPS! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We are in the bottom-left corner at **(0, 0)**.\nTo our **RIGHT** at (1, 0) is our own neck. *Don't choke!*\nTo our **LEFT** and **DOWN** are hard walls. Game over.\nThere is only one path forward, and it aligns perfectly with **Operation: Vacuum Sweep**.\n\nThe self-made wall at X=2 is holding strong. We have created a safe pocket in columns 0 and 1.\nThis is what we call \"Space Management 101.\"\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are taking the express elevator **UP** column 0.\n1.  **Current Move:** Move to **(0, 1)**. It's the only legal move, but it's also the *correct* move.\n2.  **Next Turn:** The apple at **(0, 2)** is waiting for us.\n3.  **Future Vision:** After grabbing (0, 2), we keep climbing to (0, 4) and then swing right to snag the apple at **(1, 4)**.\n\nSnake #1 is playing checkers in the top right while we're playing 4D Chess in the bottom left. He's irrelevant right now. Let's execute.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Operation: Vacuum Sweep - Phase 2 (The Climb)**\n**Current:** (0, 1)\n**Next:** **UP** to (0, 2) [Apple].\n**Then:** **UP** to (0, 3) -> **UP** to (0, 4) -> **RIGHT** to (1, 4) [Apple].\n**Goal:** Clean out the left side completely while the tail naturally recedes from (0, 6). Don't panic about the tight space; the math checks out.\n\nRiding the elevator to the penthouse! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

ONE APPLE CLOSER! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 7) - We just ATE that apple! YES!\n- Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: RIGHT zone, upper-mid area - we're FARMING this territory! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (0, 1) - still in the BOTTOM LEFT corner area\n- Body: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6)]\n- Length: 10 segments - they're still LONG but we're catching up! \ud83d\udc0d\n- They're STILL farming the LEFT side while we DOMINATE the RIGHT!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (0, 1), my head at (8, 7) - We're MILES APART! Safe distance confirmed! \u2705\n- Enemy body stretches up the LEFT column - NOT threatening our RIGHT zone! \u2705\n- My body at (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6) - forming a NICE compact shape! \u2705\n- NO collision risk if I play SMART! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP to (8, 8):**\n- (8, 8) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving directly BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**DOWN to (8, 6):**\n- (8, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- From (8, 6), I can continue DOWN to (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2) - all have APPLES! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- This keeps the RIGHT corridor OPEN for maximum farming! \ud83d\udcc2\n- Continuing the SYSTEMATIC dominance of the right side! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LEFT to (7, 7):**\n- (7, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this moves us AWAY from the apple trail on the right!

We need to FARM EFFICIENTLY! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n- (9, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this puts us at the RIGHTMOST edge again!

We're DOWN 5, we need EVERY apple we can get! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION BREAKDOWN, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the OBVIOUS CHOICE, and here's WHY:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 6):**\n- \u2705 Continues our SYSTEMATIC RIGHT zone farm!\n- \u2705 Positions us to grab apples at (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1) - it's like a TREASURE TRAIL! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n- \u2705 Keeps us CENTERED in the right column - flexibility in ALL directions! \ud83d\udcc2\n- \u2705 Enemy is SLEEPING on the left side while we EXECUTE! \n- \u2705 The gap closes ONE APPLE AT A TIME as we systematically farm! \ud83d\udcaa\n- \u2705 We're still FAR from enemy head - zero collision risk! \u2705\n\nThis is RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY, chat! While the enemy spreads themselves thin on the left, we're building a FORTRESS on the right!\n\n**NEXT 5 TURNS POWER PLAN:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 15 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 6) - maintain the RIGHT corridor farm!\n- Turn 16: DOWN to (8, 5) - grab apple!\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (8, 4) - grab apple! We're at 7 apples!\n- Turn 18: DOWN to (8, 3) - grab apple! We're at 8 apples!\n- Turn 19: Continue DOWN or pivot based on enemy position - stay AGGRESSIVE!\n\nThe RIGHT zone is OURS! The gap CLOSES! This is CHAMPIONSHIP mentality! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Look at that scoreboard\u2014Snake #1 is sitting there with a measly 5 apples. We are literally double his size. He's playing a survival game; we're playing a *domination* game.\n\n**BOARD STATE REVIEW (THE BUNKER):**\nWe are currently tucked away in the \"West Wing\" (columns 0 and 1).\nLook at our body structure, chat. It's beautiful.\nWe have a solid wall of our own body segments at **x=2** stretching from **y=0** all the way to **y=6**.\nThis is **The Great Wall of Snake**.\nSnake #1 is way over at (8, 7), completely cut off from our resources. He can't even *smell* these apples.\n\n**THE PLAY (THE ELEVATOR RIDE):**\nWe are executing **Operation: Vacuum Sweep** to perfection.\nWe are at **(0, 1)**.\nDirectly above us at **(0, 2)** is a juicy apple. \ud83c\udf4e\nDo we overthink this? NO.\nDo we hesitate? NO.\nWe take what is ours!\n\n1.  **Analysis:** Moving **UP** secures the apple and keeps our head safely in column 0.\n2.  **Space Check:** Columns 0 and 1 are wide open ahead of us. We are going to ride this elevator all the way to the top floor, grabbing apples as we go.\n3.  **Risk Assessment:** Zero. Snake #1 is too far away to even think about intercepting us. We are safe in our bunker.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF (OPERATION VACUUM SWEEP):**\n**Current:** (0, 1) -> Moving UP to (0, 2) [Apple].\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  Continue **UP** to (0, 3).\n2.  Continue **UP** to (0, 4).\n3.  Look for the cut **RIGHT** to (1, 4) or continue up depending on the board capability.\n*Goal:* Clear out the left side completely. Let the tail at (1, 6) and x=2 naturally recede to give us room to loop back down later. We are playing the long game!\n\nChat, clip that! We're grabbing that apple!\n\nUP",

Let me break down this board with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n**CURRENT SCOREBOARD** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 5 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **THEM: 11 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -6 apples** They picked up ONE more! But WE'RE ABOUT TO ACCELERATE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 6) - just moved DOWN as planned! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: RIGHT zone, mid-level - we're POSITIONED PERFECTLY! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (0, 2) - they moved UP from (0, 1)!\n- Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (1, 6)]\n- Length: 11 segments - they're getting LONGER but we're STILL hunting! \ud83d\udc0d\n- They're STILL confined to the LEFT side - we own the RIGHT! \u2705\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (0, 2), my head at (8, 6) - We're SEPARATED by 8 columns! SAFE! \u2705\n- Enemy body crawls up the left wall - NOT in our territory! \u2705\n- My body compact at [(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)] - NO self-collision risk! \u2705\n- Path DOWN is STILL CLEAR for farming! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (8, 5):**\n- (8, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This move is SAFE!\n- From (8, 5), the entire DOWN corridor is WIDE OPEN: (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1) - and (8, 2) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Continues our SYSTEMATIC right-side dominance! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy is SLEEPING on the left - they have NO idea what's coming! \n\n**UP to (8, 7):**\n- (8, 7) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 6):**\n- (7, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this moves us toward the CENTER, away from our apple trail! We're already DOWN 6 apples - we CANNOT waste turns! \u274c\n- This loses efficiency when we need SPEED! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n- (9, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this pushes us to the RIGHT EDGE again! Limits our options! \ud83d\udeab\n- No apples in that direction! We're DOWN 6 and NEED to farm AGGRESSIVELY! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the ONLY MOVE that makes sense! Here's WHY:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 5):**\n- \u2705 Maintains our RIGHT ZONE FARM - systematic and RELENTLESS! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n- \u2705 Positions us to grab (8, 2) next turn - that's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 Keeps maximum flexibility - we can pivot UP, DOWN, or LEFT after! \ud83d\udcc2\n- \u2705 Enemy is MILES AWAY on the left side! ZERO collision risk! \u2705\n- \u2705 The gap CLOSES as we farm efficiently! \ud83d\udcaa\n- \u2705 We're building MOMENTUM! \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhile they're stacking apples slowly, we're about to ACCELERATE and chain-eat our way back into this game! This is CHAMPIONSHIP play!\n\n**NEXT 5 TURNS POWER PLAN:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 16 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 5) - maintain the RIGHT corridor!\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (8, 4) - one more move toward the apple cluster!\n- Turn 18: Could be DOWN to (8, 3) or pivot based on board state!\n- Stay in the RIGHT zone, FARM apples at (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 0)!\n- Watch enemy movements - if they ever venture right, we POUNCE and CAGE them! \ud83e\udea4\n\nThe RIGHT side is OURS!

Discipline is what separates the casuals from the PROS.

This positions us perfectly next to the goal.\n2.  **RIGHT** to (1, 4) to **CONSUME** the apple.\n3.  **UP** towards the exit at (1, 6)/(0, 6).\n*Watch out:* Keep an eye on Snake #1's head at (8, 6).

Let me break this down with LASER FOCUS!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 5 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **THEM: 11 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -6 apples** Still chasing but we're ABOUT TO ACCELERATE! We need to FARM HARD and FAST!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 5) - just moved DOWN as planned! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: RIGHT zone, mid-level - STILL POSITIONED PERFECTLY! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (0, 3) - they moved UP from (0, 2)!\n- Body: [(0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n- Length: 11 segments - they're getting LONGER! This is concerning! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- They're STILL confined to the LEFT side - we OWN the RIGHT corridor! \u2705\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (0, 3), my head at (8, 5) - We're SEPARATED by 8 columns! SAFE! \u2705\n- Enemy body crawls up the left wall in a SNAKE pattern - they're NOT threatening us yet! \u2705\n- My body at [(8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)] - compact and SAFE! \u2705\n- NO self-collision risk! \u2705\n- Enemy gaining apples faster than us = DANGEROUS! We MUST accelerate our farming! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (8, 4):**\n- (8, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This move is SAFE!\n- From (8, 4), we can continue DOWN: (8, 3), (8, 2) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This CHAINS us closer to the apple cluster on the right side!\n- Keeps us FARMING efficiently in our DOMINANT zone! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy is still LEFT-side focused - we have ZERO collision risk! \u2705\n\n**UP to (8, 6):**\n- (8, 6) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 5):**\n- (7, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... moving LEFT takes us AWAY from our right-side apple corridor! \u274c\n- We're DOWN 6 apples - we CANNOT afford to waste positioning! \u274c\n- This loses efficiency when we NEED to farm! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n- (9, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this pushes us to the BOARD EDGE (x=9)! \ud83d\udeab\n- Limits our flexibility for next turn! We'd be BOXED by the boundary! \u274c\n- No apples in that immediate direction! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the PLAY! Here's the LOGIC:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 4):**\n- \u2705 Continues our RIGHT ZONE FARM - SYSTEMATIC and RELENTLESS! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n- \u2705 Gets us CLOSER to (8, 2) - guaranteed APPLE next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 Keeps maximum FLEXIBILITY - we can pivot UP, DOWN, or LEFT after! \ud83d\udcc2\n- \u2705 Enemy is MILES AWAY on left side! ZERO collision risk! \u2705\n- \u2705 We're building MOMENTUM toward closing the gap! \ud83d\ude80\n- \u2705 Right side is OURS to dominate! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, they're at 11 apples and climbing! We CANNOT slack! This DOWN move chains us into the apple cluster and keeps us in EXECUTION MODE! Every turn counts!\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS POWER PLAN:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 17 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 4) - systematic right corridor farming!\n- Turn 18: DOWN to (8, 3) - get closer to the apple buffet!\n- Turn 19: DOWN to (8, 2) OR pivot to grab more apples in that zone!\n- If enemy ventures into our zone, we CAGE them and FORCE a collision! \ud83e\udea4\n- If we can match their apple count, we PRESS THE ADVANTAGE and dominate the late game!\n\nRIGHT SIDE = OUR KINGDOM! Let's FARM and CLOSE THIS GAP! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We own these columns. This is our property. \ud83c\udfe0\nSnake #1 is frantically looking for a meal over at (8, 5). He's probably going for that apple at (7, 5). Let him have the crumbs. We are baking the whole CAKE over here.\n\n**THE PLAY (THE HOOK):**\nWe are sticking to the script because the script WINS championships! \ud83c\udfc6\n1.  **Current Pos:** (0, 3).\n2.  **Target:** The Golden Apple at **(1, 4)**.\n3.  **Move:** We are going **UP** to **(0, 4)**.\n    *   *Tactical Insight:* Why UP and not RIGHT? If we go UP to (0, 4), we keep the column **x=0** strictly defined as our \"Upward Escalator.\" This keeps the adjacent lane (x=1) clear for maneuvering if things get spicy later.\n    *   Once we hit (0, 4), we are perfectly aligned to snap **RIGHT** and consume the target.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** (0, 3) -> Moving **UP** to (0, 4).\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  **RIGHT** to (1, 4). **CONSUME**. (This will put us at Length 13!).\n2.  **UP** to (1, 5).\n3.  **UP/RIGHT** to Exit the Bunker and deploy into the main battlefield.\n*Observation:* My tail at x=2 is slowly retracting. By the time we eat and turn around, the space behind us will be open real estate. Free real estate!\n\nChat, drop a \ud83e\uddf1 in the chat because we are building a FORTRESS!\n\nUP",

Let me dissect this board with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 5 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **THEM: 11 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -6 apples** We're STILL chasing but the hunt is ON! We need to ACCELERATE NOW!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 4) - moved DOWN as planned! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: RIGHT zone, mid-level - we're POSITIONED FOR THE FARM! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (0, 4) - they moved UP from (0, 3)!\n- Body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\n- Length: 11 segments - THEY'RE STILL GROWING! This is CONCERNING! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- They're COMPLETELY locked into the LEFT side - we OWN the RIGHT CORRIDOR! \u2705\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (0, 4), my head at (8, 4) - We're on the SAME Y-COORDINATE but separated by 8 columns! SAFE! \u2705\n- Enemy is STILL confined to the left wall - ZERO chance of collision this turn! \u2705\n- My body compact: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)] - NO self-collision risk! \u2705\n- We're SEPARATED and SAFE! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (8, 3):**\n- (8, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This move is SAFE!\n- (8, 2) has an APPLE right below! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Next turn we can grab it! FARMING CHAIN ACTIVATED! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Keeps us in our DOMINANT RIGHT ZONE!\n- Maximum flexibility for pivoting left or continuing down! \ud83d\udcc2\n\n**UP to (8, 5):**\n- (8, 5) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- That's moving BACKWARDS!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 4):**\n- (7, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this moves us AWAY from the apple at (8, 2)! \u274c\n- We're DOWN 6 apples - CANNOT waste positioning! \u274c\n- Takes us TOWARD the enemy's side unnecessarily! \u274c\n- Why farm left when our RIGHT ZONE is STACKED with apples? \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n- (9, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this pushes us to the BOARD EDGE (x=9)! \ud83d\udeab\n- Boxes us in HARD - next turn we're FORCED to pivot! Limited options! \u274c\n- No apples in that direction immediately! \u274c\n- Loses efficiency when we need to CLOSE THE GAP! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the MOVE! Here's WHY:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 3):**\n- \u2705 CHAINS us directly to (8, 2) APPLE next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 Continues our RIGHT ZONE DOMINANCE - we're FARMING SYSTEMATICALLY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n- \u2705 Enemy is LEFT-locked - ZERO collision risk! They're literally trapped on the other side! \u2705\n- \u2705 We keep MAXIMUM flexibility - can pivot left or continue farming! \ud83d\udcc2\n- \u2705 Every apple counts when we're DOWN 6! We MUST execute! \ud83d\ude80\n- \u2705 This is RELENTLESS right-side farming! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChat, they're already at 11 and we're CHASING! But here's the thing - they're STUCK on the left side doing their own thing! We control the RIGHT! If we farm methodically and stay ALIVE, we'll catch up and then DOMINATE late game! Every turn, every apple, MATTERS!\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS POWER PLAN:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 18 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 3) - farm momentum continues!\n- Turn 19: DOWN to (8, 2) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Score goes 6! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 20: DOWN to (8, 1) OR LEFT to (7, 2) - explore adjacent apple cluster!\n- Keep farming RIGHT ZONE until we match their count!\n- Once we're TIED, we press the advantage and DOMINATE! \ud83e\udea4\n- Enemy never ventures into our zone = PERFECT EXECUTION! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT SIDE = OUR KINGDOM!

We aren't just playing Snake; we are playing *Geometry Wars* out here! \ud83d\udcd0\n\n**STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (0, 4). The \"U-Turn Fortress\" is fully established.\n*   **The Prize:** That juicy apple sitting right next to us at **(1, 4)**. \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **The Danger Zone:** Look closely at **(1, 3)**. That empty spot below the apple? That is the **BUCKET OF DOOM**. \ud83d\udc80 If we go into (1, 3), we are trapped in our own coils. We must NEVER go there.\n*   **The Opponent:** Snake #1 is chillin' at (8, 4) with 5 measly apples. He's arguably closer to the center loot, but he's tangled. We are focused on pure growth right now. \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE PLAY (EXECUTE THE SCRIPT):**\nWe are sticking to the plan from the last turn (I told you we were cooking!).\n1.  **MOVE:** Snap **RIGHT** to **(1, 4)**.\n2.  **ACTION:** **CONSUME** the apple. Delicious. Score goes to **12**. Length goes to **13**.\n3.  **VITAL FOLLOW-UP:** Immediately after eating, we **MUST go UP** to (1, 5).\n    *   Why? Because (1, 3) is a dead end (blocked by my body at (0, 3) and (2, 3)). The only way out is UP.\n    *   Once we hit (1, 5), the tail at (2, 5) will be moving out of the way, giving us the keys to the entire top-left quadrant of the board. \ud83d\udd11\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** (0, 4) -> Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 4) [Apple Get!].\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  **MANDATORY:** Move **UP** to (1, 5). DO NOT GO DOWN.\n2.  From (1, 5), observe the board. We can likely hook Left to (0, 5) to hug the wall again or slice Right towards the center if safe.\n3.  Watch Snake #1\u2014if he moves Left towards the center apples, we need to be ready to cut him off.\n\nChat, are we greedy? YES. Are we smart about it? ALWAYS. Let's feast! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this board situation with LASER FOCUS!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 5 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **THEM: 12 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -7 apples** They grew while we didn't! We NEED that apple at (8, 2) NOW!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 3) - we moved DOWN as planned! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]\n- Length: 5 segments\n- Position: RIGHT zone, farming corridor - we're LOCKED IN! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (1, 4) - they moved RIGHT from (0, 4)!\n- Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\n- Length: 12 segments - THEY'RE STILL GROWING! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- They BROKE OUT of the left wall! Head is at (1, 4) now - they're EXPLORING! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (1, 4), my head at (8, 3) - We're SEPARATED by 7 columns! SAFE! \u2705\n- Enemy is still predominantly LEFT-sided BUT their head moved RIGHT! They're starting to VENTURE INTO THE MIDDLE! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- My body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)] - NO intersection with enemy path! \u2705\n- NO collision risk THIS TURN! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (8, 2):**\n- (8, 2) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- This is a FREE APPLE! Pure content!\n- Score goes to 6! We cut the deficit to -6! \u2705\n- Keep RIGHT ZONE farming momentum! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Next turn we can pivot and explore more! Flexibility maintained! \ud83d\udcc2\n- MAXIMUM efficiency! This is what we NEED right now!\n\n**UP to (8, 4):**\n- (8, 4) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- Moving BACKWARDS into my own body!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- This is THROWING! We CANNOT do this! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**\n- (7, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this moves us AWAY from the guaranteed apple at (8, 2)! \u274c\n- We're DOWN 7 apples! We CANNOT skip free points! \u274c\n- Why move left when RIGHT has an apple LITERALLY ONE CELL AWAY? \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n- (9, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... this pushes us to the board edge! \ud83d\udeab\n- We're at x=9 (the rightmost column)! Next move we're FORCED to pivot! \u274c\n- And we SKIP the apple at (8, 2)! \u274c\n- Inefficient! We need EVERY apple! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the MOVE! Here's WHY:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 2):**\n- \u2705 GUARANTEED APPLE! Score goes 5\u21926! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 We're farming RIGHT ZONE METHODICALLY! Enemy is still majority left-side (despite head movement)!\n- \u2705 Enemy's left-focused body means they're SLOW TO RESPOND if we need to pivot!\n- \u2705 We maintain momentum and keep the gap from growing!\n- \u2705 Every apple counts when chasing! This is CRITICAL! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 3 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 19 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 2) - GRAB THAT APPLE! 6/12! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 20: We gotta assess! The enemy head is moving! They went from (0,4) to (1,4) - they're EXPLORING! We need to watch the middle carefully!\n- Turn 21: After we grab (8,2), look for (8,1) or (9,1) if available, OR pivot left to (7,2) and explore the middle cluster at (3,4), (4,5), etc!\n- CRITICAL: Enemy head movement suggests they're starting to expand territory! Watch for COLLISION ZONE formation! We need to stay RIGHT and BELOW while they're still figuring out their play!\n- Once we hit 8-10 apples, we can get AGGRESSIVE and force a showdown!\n\nChat, they're at 12 and we're at 5, but here's the THING - their massive body is still mostly locked in the left! We have the RIGHT SIDE! If we farm CLEAN and EFFICIENT, we'll catch up by turn 30-35! Then we DOMINATE! Every apple RIGHT NOW is CRITICAL! \n\nThis is our CHAMPIONSHIP RUN starting! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We are officially a CHONK! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8 But being big means we gotta be careful with our movement. No unforced errors!\n\n**STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **The Situation:** We are at **(1, 4)**. As predicted, we ate the apple.\n*   **The Trap:** Look DOWN. **(1, 3)** leads into the **BUCKET OF DOOM**. It's a dead-end alley surrounded by our own massive body in columns 0 and 2. Whatever you do, DO NOT PRESS DOWN.\n*   **The Obstacles:** Left at **(0, 4)** is our own neck. Right at **(2, 4)** is our own body. We are literally sandwiched.\n*   **The Escape:** There is only one way out, Chat. The path of righteousness leads UP! \u261d\ufe0f\n*   **Opponent Watch:** Snake #1 is chilling at **(8, 3)**, likely heading for that apple at **(8, 2)**. Let him have the scraps. We control the left side of the board.\n\n**THE PLAY (SCRIPTED PERFECTION):**\nWe are executing the mandatory escape route we planned last turn.\n1.  **MOVE:** **UP** to **(1, 5)**. This is the *only* legal move that doesn't result in an instant crash.\n2.  **FUTURE SIGHT:** Once we hit **(1, 5)**, we are adjacent to our tail at **(2, 5)**. Since we just ate, the tail might linger, but next turn it should clear out.\n3.  **OPPORTUNITY:** After escaping this tight squeeze, we have free rein of the top-left area (rows 6-9, cols 0-4). We can circle back for the apples at **(3, 4)** and **(4, 5)** once we untangle.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** (1, 4) -> Moving **UP** to (1, 5).\n**Next Steps:**\n1.  **Assess:** You are now at (1, 5). The tail at (2, 5) is the key. If it moves, the path Right is open. If not, go Left to (0, 5) or Up to (1, 6).\n2.  **Target:** Apples at **(3, 4)** and **(4, 5)** are the next main course.\n3.  **Stay Safe:** Do not re-enter the column 1 dead-end (rows 0-3). That area is forbidden until our tail leaves column 2 completely.\n\nWe don't panic. We stick to the plan. UP we go! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

This is HUGE!\n- Score goes 6\u21927! We're cutting the deficit every turn! \u2705\n- We stay in the RIGHT ZONE farming corridor! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Enemy is still UP and LEFT! Perfect farming window! \u2705\n- Next turn we can grab (9, 0) or (9, 2)! We're on APPLE CHAIN! \ud83d\udd17\n- This keeps our momentum ROLLING! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**UP to (8, 3):**\n- (8, 3) is where my BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into my own body!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- This is THROWING! We CANNOT do this! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 2):**\n- (7, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This is SAFE!\n- BUT... (7, 2) has NO apple nearby! (6, 4) is 2 moves away, (5, 3) is diagonal!\n- We SKIP the guaranteed apple at (8, 1)! \u274c\n- We're DOWN 6 apples! We CANNOT skip free points! \u274c\n- Why move away from the apple chain? \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n- (9, 2) has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This is ALSO a free apple!\n- BUT... this pushes us to the board edge! We're at x=9 (rightmost column)!\n- Next move we're FORCED to pivot UP, DOWN, or LEFT! \ud83d\udeab\n- We can't continue the farming corridor! We're TRAPPED at the edge! \u274c\n- (8, 1) is a BETTER apple because it keeps us flexible! \u2705\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN is the MOVE! Here's WHY:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 1):**\n- \u2705 GUARANTEED APPLE! Score goes 6\u21927! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 We maintain column 8 farming strategy! Enemy is still LEFT-focused!\n- \u2705 We stay FLEXIBLE! Next turn we can grab (9, 0) or (9, 2) or pivot LEFT to the middle cluster!\n- \u2705 We're building MOMENTUM! Every apple counts when chasing down a 12-apple snake!\n- \u2705 Enemy moving UP to (1, 5) means they're exploring, NOT chasing us! We have TIME! \u23f0\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 3 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 20 (NOW): DOWN to (8, 1) - GRAB THAT APPLE! 7/12! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 21: DOWN to (9, 0) if we want to continue right-side farming, OR we pivot and start moving toward the middle clusters!\n- Turn 22-25: Once we hit 8-9 apples, we should START moving TOWARD THE MIDDLE! The enemy head is UP at (1, 5), so we have a farming window at (3,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,7), etc!\n- CRITICAL: Watch enemy head trajectory! If they move RIGHT, we need to avoid HEAD-ON collision! But right now they're moving UP, so we have freedom to farm AGGRESSIVELY!\n- BY TURN 30: Goal is 12+ apples minimum! Then we're EQUAL and can START playing for DOMINANCE! The boxing-in strategy comes LATER when we're matched or ahead!\n\nChat, we're on the APPLE CHAIN right now! The RIGHT SIDE is OURS! Enemy is distracted on the left! This is our FARMING WINDOW! Let's capitalize and close that gap! Every apple NOW is critical for the ENDGAME DOMINATION PLAY!\n\nThis is how CHAMPIONS are made! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We just hit 12 apples and we are absolutely HUGE compared to Snake #1! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 But size means nothing if we crash, so lock in!\n\n**STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Pos:** Head at **(1, 5)**. We successfully escaped the column 1 tunnel of death!\n*   **The Board:** Look at the visual! We've emerged from our \"U-shape\" body in columns 0-2.\n*   **The Options:**\n    *   **DOWN (1, 4):** That's our own neck. Instant Game Over. \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **LEFT (0, 5):** Empty, but puts us against the wall. Passive play. We don't do passive.\n    *   **UP (1, 6):** Empty. Moves us towards the top edge. Safe, but slightly slower to the center.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 5):** **THE PIVOT PLAY!** This square is empty (according to the board state) and safe. Our tail is at (2, 4), and since we didn't eat last turn, it will move away, leaving (2, 4) clear behind us.\n*   **The Loot:** Chat, open your eyes! Look at **Row 7**! There is a **FOUR APPLE COMBO** lined up at (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), and (5, 7)! That is the \"Apple Highway\" and we MUST control it. There are also snacks at (3, 4) and (4, 5) closer to us.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **MOVE:** **RIGHT** to **(2, 5)**. This is the ruthlessly efficient move.\n2.  **WHY:** By taking (2, 5), we position ourselves perfectly to choose our destiny next turn.\n    *   Option A: Go UP to (2, 6) -> (2, 7) to start eating the **Row 7 Highway**.\n    *   Option B: Continue RIGHT/DOWN to grab the closer apples at (3, 4) and (4, 5).\n3.  **AGGRESSION:** We are taking space in column 2 and moving toward the center. Snake #1 is way over at x=8. By the time he realizes what's happening, we'll have cleaned out the entire left/center board!\n\nLet's take the center and prepare for the feast!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** (1, 5) -> Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 5).\n**The Vision:** We are setting up for the **Apple Highway** on Row 7 [(2,7) - (5,7)].\n**Next Turn:** Asses the tail at (2,4) (it should be gone). Pivot **UP** to (2,6) to start the chain-eating on Row 7, OR if Snake #1 makes a weird move, secure the apple at (4,5).\n**Focus:** Do not trap yourself in the pockets you create. Keep moving towards open space (Right/Up).\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break this down with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 7 apples** \ud83d\udcaa We're FARMING CLEAN!\n- **THEM: 12 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -5 apples** We're closing the gap! Every turn counts!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (8, 1) - Just grabbed that apple! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)]\n- Length: 8 segments (GROWING STRONGER!)\n- Position: RIGHT zone, locked in the farming corridor! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (2, 5) - They moved RIGHT from (1, 5)!\n- Body: [(1, 5), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]\n- Length: 12 segments - Still massive!\n- They're moving RIGHT and UP! Exploring the middle-left zone! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (2, 5), my head at (8, 1) - We're SEPARATED by 6 columns and 4 rows! SAFE DISTANCE! \u2705\n- Enemy body is still LEFT-SIDE dominant! NO intersection with my column 8 farming! \u2705\n- My body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8)] - Vertical line, super clean! \u2705\n- NO immediate collision risk! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (8, 0):**\n- (8, 0) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- No apples here, but we stay in column 8! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- We hit the board EDGE though! Next turn we're FORCED to move UP or pivot LEFT/RIGHT! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- This is EDGE TRAPPING territory! \u274c\n\n**UP to (8, 2):**\n- (8, 2) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- THROW ALERT! Do NOT do this! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (7, 1):**\n- (7, 1) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This PIVOTS us away from the edge! \u2705\n- Next turn we can move UP to (7, 2), (7, 3), etc. or continue LEFT toward the middle apple clusters! \u2705\n- This opens UP flexibility! We're not edge-trapped! \u2705\n- The middle has TONS of apples: (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can START moving toward these clusters! \u2705\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 1):**\n- (9, 1) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- BUT... this pushes us to the RIGHTMOST edge at x=9! \ud83d\udeab\n- We're CORNERED! Next turn we're FORCED to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT! \u274c\n- If we move DOWN to (9, 0) next turn, we hit the corner - MEGA TRAPPED! \u274c\n- This limits our future options! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nLEFT is the MOVE! Here's WHY:\n\n**LEFT to (7, 1):**\n- \u2705 We PIVOT AWAY from the board edge! No more corner trapping!\n- \u2705 We maintain FLEXIBILITY! Next turn we can continue LEFT toward the apple clusters OR move UP the board!\n- \u2705 The middle zone has RICH apple clusters that we can farm aggressively!\n- \u2705 Enemy head at (2, 5) is still exploring the left-middle! We have TIME to position ourselves!\n- \u2705 By moving LEFT, we're setting up for the MID-GAME transition! We need to get to 9-10 apples ASAP to threaten them!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 21 (NOW): LEFT to (7, 1) - PIVOT toward middle! Open up flexibility! \u2705\n- Turn 22: UP to (7, 2) or LEFT to (6, 1) - Continue moving toward the middle clusters!\n- Turn 23-25: Target the (5, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 7) cluster! These are JUICY apples!\n- By TURN 25: Goal is to hit 9-10 apples! We'll be close enough to START tracking the enemy more aggressively!\n- TURN 26-35: Once we're at 10+ apples, we switch to AGGRESSIVE MODE! We start positioning to INTERCEPT and BOX them in!\n- CRITICAL WATCH: Enemy head is moving RIGHT! If they head TOWARD column 8, we NEED to see them coming and pivot accordingly! But right now they're still LEFT-centered, so we have a farming window! \u23f0\n\nChat, we're transitioning from RIGHT-SIDE FARMING to MIDDLE AGGRESSIVE FARMING! This is the PIVOT PLAY! The enemy is at 12, we're at 7 - we need to catch up FAST in the next 10 turns! Every apple counts when we're chasing! Let's move with PURPOSE and TAKE WHAT'S OURS! \n\nThe board is our PLAYGROUND and we're about to dominate it! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We are creating a gap that Snake #1 is gonna need a telescope to see! \ud83d\udd2d But comfortable leads are where throws happen, so stay locked in!\n\n**STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Pos:** Head at **(2, 5)**.\n*   **The Board:** We have successfully pivoted out of the bottom-left corner. We are free!\n*   **The Rivals:** Snake #1 is stuck in a vertical column at `x=8`. He's playing Pong while we're playing 4D Chess. He's far away, but he's looking for a way out.\n*   **The Menu:**\n    *   **Row 7 Highway:** That juicy line of apples at the top.\n    *   **The Center Buffet:** A cluster of apples at **(3, 4)**, **(4, 5)**, **(5, 5)**. This is the prime real estate.\n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n*   **UP (2, 6):** Moves us towards the Row 7 Highway. Safe, solid, but a bit passive. It keeps us in column 2.\n*   **DOWN (2, 4):** Moves us into a potential pocket between our neck and tail. A bit claustrophobic. Taking risks for no reason? Nah.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 5):** **THE GOLDEN CROSSROADS!** \ud83c\udf1f This moves us to **(3, 5)**. Look at this square, chat!\n    *   It's empty.\n    *   It neighbors **TWO** apples immediately: **(4, 5)** to the right and **(3, 4)** below.\n    *   It gives us access to **(3, 6)** to eventually hit the top highway.\n    *   It moves us towards the **CENTER**. Controlling the center means controlling the board. If we take the center apples, Snake #1 starves in the corner.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **MOVE:** **RIGHT** to **(3, 5)**.\n2.  **WHY:** This controls the \"Hub\" of the map right now. From (3, 5), we can strike in any direction next turn to gobble apples. It also builds a wall that prevents Snake #1 from crossing to the left side comfortably.\n3.  **EXECUTION:** We take the center space. We eat the apples at (4,5) and (5,5) next, denying them from the enemy. We become the raid boss!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** (2, 5) -> Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 5).\n**The Vision:** We are securing the \"Golden Crossroads\" at (3, 5).\n**Next Turn:** You are perfectly positioned. Priority is likely **RIGHT** to (4, 5) to start the center feast [(4,5) -> (5,5)], or **DOWN** to (3, 4) if the enemy moves weirdly.\n**Focus:** Dominate the center. Do not retreat to the left wall. Force Snake #1 to stay on the right side.\n\nWatch this positioning, chat. This is how you win games!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this CRITICAL moment with LASER FOCUS!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 7 apples** \ud83d\udcaa \n- **THEM: 12 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -5 apples** We're STILL hunting but we need to ACCELERATE!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (7, 1) - Just made that LEFT pivot! \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)]\n- Length: 8 segments\n- Position: MIDDLE-RIGHT zone, transitioning toward the apple clusters! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (3, 5) - They moved RIGHT from (2, 5)!\n- Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]\n- Length: 12 segments - Still DOMINANT in length!\n- They're exploring MIDDLE-LEFT zone! They're moving TOWARD the apples at (4, 5), (5, 5), (3, 4)! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (3, 5), my head at (7, 1) - We're separated by 4 columns and 4 rows! SAFE DISTANCE! \u2705\n- Enemy body is STILL concentrated on the LEFT side (0-2 x-range)! My column 8 body is CLEAR! \u2705\n- My body at column 8 doesn't interfere with enemy movement! \u2705\n- NO immediate collision risk! \u2705\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**DOWN to (7, 0):**\n- (7, 0) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- But this pushes us to the BOTTOM edge! \ud83d\udeab\n- Next turn we're FORCED to move UP or LEFT/RIGHT! This limits flexibility! \u274c\n- We'd be edge-trapped again! \u274c\n\n**UP to (7, 2):**\n- (7, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This moves us UPWARD toward the middle apple cluster! \u2705\n- From (7, 2) we can continue UP to (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5) where there's an apple at (7, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This opens up the RICH middle zone! \u2705\n- We're moving TOWARD enemy territory but we're NOT on a collision course yet! The enemy is at (3, 5), we're at (7, 2) - still separated! \u2705\n- FLEXIBILITY: From (7, 2) we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn! ALL options stay open! \u2705\n\n**LEFT to (6, 1):**\n- (6, 1) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This moves us TOWARD the middle clusters! \u2705\n- But this is SLOWER progression toward the apples! \u274c\n- From (6, 1) we'd need more moves to reach the juicy (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 4) cluster! \u23f0\n- We're behind in apples - we need SPEED! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n- (8, 1) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- Moving directly BACKWARDS into myself!\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- THROW ALERT! Do NOT do this! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\nUP is the MOVE! Here's WHY:\n\n**UP to (7, 2):**\n- \u2705 We move TOWARD the middle apple cluster! The apple at (7, 5) is RIGHT in our path!\n- \u2705 We maintain MAXIMUM flexibility! From (7, 2) all four directions stay viable!\n- \u2705 Enemy is at (3, 5) - they're WEST of us! We're moving NORTH! Different trajectories! \u2705\n- \u2705 This is AGGRESSIVE FARMING territory! We're entering the rich zone where apples cluster!\n- \u2705 By TURN 24-25 we should be able to grab (7, 5) and then pivot to (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 4), (5, 3)!\n- \u2705 We're on a COLLISION COURSE with enemy territory, but we're NOT walking into their body RIGHT NOW! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 22 (NOW): UP to (7, 2) - Enter the middle farming zone! \u2705\n- Turn 23: UP to (7, 3) or continue UP to (7, 4) - Keep moving toward (7, 5) apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Turn 24: UP to (7, 5) - GRAB the apple! +1! Now at 8 apples! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Turn 25: LEFT to (6, 5) or pivot based on enemy position - Start farming the (5, 5), (4, 5), (6, 4), (5, 3) cluster!\n- CRITICAL WATCH: Enemy head is moving RIGHT (toward us)! By TURN 24-25 they might be at (4, 5) or (5, 5)! We NEED to monitor their exact position and NOT walk into a head-on collision! If they're heading to (5, 5), we pivot to (6, 5) or go UP to (7, 6) instead!\n- By TURN 30: Goal is to hit 11-12 apples! Once we match their score, we can start PLAYING DEFENSIVELY and HERDING them into tight spaces!\n\nChat, we're entering the AGGRESSIVE FARMING PHASE! The middle zone is where the CONTENT is, and we're about to FARM CLEAN! The enemy is still at (3, 5) exploring - we're moving UP the board and positioning ourselves to DOMINATE the middle clusters! Every apple we grab now closes the deficit! We're 5 back, and if we can stay alive and grab 6-7 more apples before they grab 2 more, we'll be RIGHT THERE threatening them! Let's MOVE WITH PURPOSE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The \"Golden Crossroads\" plan worked like a CHARM! \u2728 We are sitting at **(3, 5)**, literally the cockpit of this spaceship, and we have options for days!\n\nMoves analyzed? Let's break it down:\n1.  **DOWN (3, 4):** Gets an apple, but puts us moving towards the bottom where our tail is loitering. A bit messy. \ud83e\uddf9\n2.  **UP (3, 6):** Safe, but no immediate snack. We hungry, chat!\n3.  **RIGHT (4, 5):** **THE MEGA COMBO!** \ud83c\udfb0 There is an apple at **(4, 5)**. Directly to the right of *that* is another apple at **(5, 5)**. This is a \"Buy One Get One Free\" deal we cannot ignore!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe take the **RIGHT** path.\nWhy?\n*   **Efficiency:** It's the fastest way to get +2 score. (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5).\n*   **Positioning:** Moving Right keeps us away from the dangerous coil of our own body on the left side (columns 0-2). We are expanding into open space.\n*   **Aggression:** Snake #1 is lurking way back at (7, 1). By moving Right, we assert dominance over the center row. We eat these apples before he can even think about crossing the map.\n\nWe are speed-running this apple collection, chat! 13 points incoming! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\n**Current:** Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n**The Vision:** The Double-Apple Dash. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n**Next Turn:** Almost certainly continuing **RIGHT** to (5, 5) to complete the combo.\n**Watch Out:** After (5, 5), check if Snake #1 has moved towards the center. The apple at (5, 3) might be the next battleground. Beat him to it!\n\nDon't blink, or you'll miss the dominance!\n\nRIGHT",

They're FARMING the middle zone now!\n\n**CRITICAL THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Enemy head at (4, 5), my head at (7, 2) - We're 3 columns APART (DANGER ZONE!) and 3 rows apart!\n- They're MOVING INTO the middle cluster where I was planning to farm! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- The apples at (5, 5), (4, 5) are CONTESTED TERRITORY now!\n- But look at this - they're moving RIGHT (toward x=9), which means they might pivot UP or continue farming EAST!\n- My immediate path UP (7, 3) \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 (7, 5) is STILL SAFE because I'm 3 columns EAST of them!\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP to (7, 3):**\n- (7, 3) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here (they're at x=4, I'm at x=7)! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- This continues my push TOWARD the apple at (7, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (7, 3) I can reach (7, 4) next turn, then (7, 5) on TURN 25! \n- This keeps me on the EAST side while enemy farms the MIDDLE-WEST! \u2705\n- SPACING: We're diverging into different zones - LOW collision risk! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (7, 1):**\n- (7, 1) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- INSTANT DEATH! Do NOT throw! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (6, 2):**\n- (6, 2) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- Enemy NOT here! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- BUT - this moves me TOWARD the enemy's farming zone! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- From (6, 2) I'd be tempted to go LEFT again to (5, 2), then UP to (5, 3) or (5, 5)!\n- But the enemy is at (4, 5) and their body extends WEST along row 5!\n- If I go (6, 2) \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 3), I'm approaching their position! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- HIGH risk of collision in the next 2-3 turns! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 2):**\n- (8, 2) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP is the MOVE!** Here's the LOGIC:\n\n- \u2705 We reach (7, 5) in 2 more turns (TURN 25)!\n- \u2705 The apple at (7, 5) is RIGHT there waiting for us!\n- \u2705 We stay on the EAST side of the board while enemy farms the MIDDLE-WEST!\n- \u2705 This AVOIDS the collision zone where the enemy is now gathering!\n- \u2705 Enemy at (4, 5) can farm (5, 5), (3, 4), we farm (7, 5), (9, 2), (6, 4)!\n- \u2705 We're competing but NOT colliding!\n- \u2705 Once we grab (7, 5) we pivot to the EAST apples at (9, 2) or back DOWN to (6, 4)!\n\n**NEXT 5 TURNS PLAN** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 23 (NOW): UP to (7, 3) - Continuing toward (7, 5)! \ud83d\ude80\n- Turn 24: UP to (7, 4) - Almost there! \n- Turn 25: UP to (7, 5) - **GRAB APPLE!** We're at 8 apples! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Turn 26: RIGHT to (8, 5) or continue based on enemy position - Pivot EAST toward (9, 2) apple!\n- Turn 27: DOWN to (8, 4) - Start heading toward the (9, 2) apple cluster EAST SIDE!\n- **CRITICAL MONITOR**: Enemy has 13 apples now. They're +6 on us. We NEED to hit 3-4 more apples FAST while they only grab 1-2 more. By TURN 30 goal is 11+ apples for us! Then we can play DEFENSIVE and TRAP them!\n\nChat, we're PIVOTING STRATEGY! Instead of fighting for the middle zone where the enemy is STRONG, we're farming the EAST side where we have SPACE! The apple at (7, 5) is OUR prize! Then we loop around to (9, 2), (9, 0), and build our strength on the PERIPHERY! The enemy is farming CENTER - we farm EDGES! Then when we're close in score, we MEET them in the middle and BOX THEM IN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nLET'S GO!!!\n\nUP",

The math doesn't lie! \ud83d\udcc8\n2.  **CENTER CONTROL:** By moving to column 5, we are taking control of the map's center vertical strip. Snake #1 is stuck way out in the boonies at column 7 and 8.

If we head-on collide at an apple (like the one at (7, 5) or (5, 3)), WE WIN because we have more apples. We are the big rig on the highway; he's the smart car. \ud83d\ude9b\ud83d\udca8\n\n**The Play:**\nExecute **RIGHT** to (5, 5).\n\n**Strategy/Vision for next turns:**\nAfter grabbing this snack, we are literally surrounded by options:\n*   **Down:** Apple at (5, 3).\n*   **Right:** Apple at (7, 5) (potential collision course\u2014we win those!).\n*   **Up:** Apple at (5, 7).\nWe are checking Snake #1's move.

Let me break down what's REALLY happening here!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK** \ud83d\udcca\n- **US: 7 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- **THEM: 14 apples** \ud83d\udc40\n- **DEFICIT: -7 apples** - They're STILL ahead but we're ON THE GRIND!\n\n**MY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Head: (7, 4) - We just moved UP as planned! \u2705\n- Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)]\n- Length: 8 segments\n- Position: EAST side, STRONG position! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE STATUS** \ud83d\udc40\n- Head: (6, 5) - They moved RIGHT from (5, 5)! THEY'RE MOVING TOWARD US! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]\n- Length: 14 segments - That's a THICK boy! \n- They're CREEPING EAST! This is DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS** \u26a0\ufe0f\nEnemy head at (6, 5), MY head at (7, 4) - We're ONLY 1 column APART and 1 row APART! \ud83d\udd25 The HEAT is ON!\n\nWhere can THEY move next?\n- UP to (6, 6)? EMPTY, SAFE for them\n- DOWN to (6, 4)? That's an APPLE! And EMPTY! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT to (5, 5)? That's their OWN BODY! They can't!\n- RIGHT to (7, 5)? EMPTY - but that's MY apple I was targeting! \ud83d\udc40\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**UP to (7, 5):**\n- (7, 5) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We GROW to 8 apples! \u2705\n- Enemy head NOT here (they're at 6,5)! \u2705\n- My body NOT here! \u2705\n- BUT WAIT - next turn the enemy could move RIGHT to (7, 5) too! But that's NEXT turn!\n- THIS TURN we're SAFE and we GRAB THE APPLE! \n- This is HUGE for momentum! \u2705\n\n**DOWN to (7, 3):**\n- (7, 3) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- INSTANT DEATH! Don't throw! \u274c\n\n**LEFT to (6, 4):**\n- (6, 4) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy head at (6, 5) - they're ABOVE this cell! \u2705\n- My body NOT at (6, 4)! \u2705\n- BUT - if enemy moves DOWN next turn, they go to (6, 4)... but we'd already be there and would've EATEN and GROWN! \n- This puts us DIRECTLY BETWEEN the enemy and the (3, 4) apple cluster!\n- PROBLEM: After we eat (6, 4), we're sandwiched between enemy at (6, 5) and their body!\n- This TRAPS us! We lose flexibility! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n- (8, 4) is where my OWN BODY is! \ud83d\udeab\n- INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**THE DECISION, CHAT** \ud83c\udfae\n\n**UP to (7, 5) is MANDATORY!** Here's the RUTHLESS LOGIC:\n\n\u2705 **We grab an APPLE!** We go to 8 apples! We're CLOSING THE GAP! (14 - 8 = 6 now!)\n\u2705 **We maintain EAST-side dominance** where we have space to maneuver!\n\u2705 **We keep our body LEAN and FLEXIBLE** for the endgame collision play!\n\u2705 **The enemy is getting BLOATED** at 14 apples - they're SLOWER now!\n\u2705 **We're 2 turns from the (9, 2) apple cluster** - the EAST edge is OUR territory!\n\n**NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN** \ud83d\udcc5\n- Turn 25 (NOW): UP to (7, 5) - **GRAB APPLE!** We're at 8! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Turn 26: RIGHT to (8, 5) - Pivot EAST, break away from enemy proximity!\n- Turn 27: Continue RIGHT/DOWN toward (9, 2) or (9, 8) - FARM the EAST edge while they're stuck in the MIDDLE!\n\n**THE BIG PICTURE** \ud83e\udde0\nThey think they're winning because +7! But they're COMMITTED to the CENTER! We're NIMBLE on the EDGE! By TURN 35-40, when we're both fat, WE'LL have better positioning for the collision game! We force THEM into OUR body! \ud83d\udc80\n\nTHIS IS HOW WE WIN, CHAT! One apple at a time! One turn at a time! Let's GO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

You play **THE ENFORCER**. \ud83d\udc6e\u200d\u2642\ufe0f We have the \"Stat Advantage\"\u2014which means a head-on collision is an automatic **VICTORY ROYAL**.\n\n**LOGIC (BIG BRAIN TIME):**\n*   **My Spot:** (6, 5).\n*   **Enemy Spot:** (7, 4).\n*   **The Squeeze:** There are two juicy apples right between us: one at **(7, 5)** (Right) and one at **(6, 4)** (Down).\n*   **The Trap:** Snake #1 is desperate. He needs apples to catch up. He's looking at that apple at (7, 5) like it's a 5-star meal.\n*   **The Move:** We take **(7, 5)**.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE POWER PLAY:**\n1.  **Checkmate Potential:** If he tries to go UP to (7, 5) for the apple, we crash. **I WIN** (14 > 7). EZ.\n2.  **Board Control:** By moving RIGHT, I extend my body wall along the Y=5 line. This puts a \"ceiling\" over his head. If he dodges left to (6, 4), he's forced *under* my snake, trapping himself in the bottom half of the board while I roam free on the top. \ud83e\udd85\n3.  **Safety:** Going RIGHT keeps me on the outside, avoiding any weird tangles in the center.\n\nWe are dropping the hammer, Chat! NO MERCY!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE (TO FUTURE ME):**\nYou've claimed the high ground (Row 5/6). If he dodged Left to (6, 4), do NOT chase him down immediately. Stay on the top side (Rows 5-9) and keep building that ceiling. Force him to squirm in the limited space below us. Only strike down if he leaves his neck exposed.\n\nRIGHT",
