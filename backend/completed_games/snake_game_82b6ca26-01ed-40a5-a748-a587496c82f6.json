Moving UP gives me the most flexibility to navigate toward any of the apples while maintaining central board position. The enemy at (2, 9) is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Early game with two snakes should focus on collecting apples efficiently while staying in safe, central positions. Move toward the cluster of apples around the center-left of the board, avoiding the edges. The closest apple chains are at (4, 3), (2, 4), and (1, 0).\n\nUP",
