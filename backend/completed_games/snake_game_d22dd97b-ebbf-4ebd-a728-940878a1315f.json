A\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . A\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 A . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . A 1 . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n```\n- Your snake is at (6, 2), which is the '1' in the board.\n- Enemy snake is at (2, 5), which is the '0' in the board.\n- Apples are at (9, 7), (4, 9), (0, 5), (5, 2), and (2, 9).\n\n### Immediate Threats and Constraints:\n1. **Your own body:** Currently, you have no body segments, so no immediate threat from your own body.\n2. **Enemy body:** Enemy has no body segments, so no immediate threat from enemy body.\n3. **Enemy head:** Enemy head is at (2, 5). If you move into (2, 5) or any cell adjacent to (2, 5) where the enemy head moves, you risk collision. However, since the enemy head moves simultaneously, we must consider where the enemy head could move next turn.\n4. **Boundary:** The board is 10x10, so moving outside this range (e.g., y < 0 or y > 9, x < 0 or x > 9) would kill you.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nLet's evaluate each direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) for safety and potential gains:\n\n#### UP (y increases):\n- New head position: (6, 3)\n- Check if this is safe:\n  - Not on boundary.\n  - Not on enemy head (2, 5) or any cell where enemy head could move next turn.\n  - No immediate threat from your own body (none).\n- Check if this is a good move:\n  - Apples near (6, 3): None directly adjacent.\n  - Enemy head at (2, 5) could move to (2, 4), (2, 6), (1, 5), or (3, 5). None of these are (6, 3), so no immediate collision risk.\n  - This move keeps you in a relatively open space, and you can explore further.\n\n#### DOWN (y decreases):\n- New head position: (6, 1)\n- Check if this is safe:\n  - Not on boundary.\n  - Not on enemy head (2, 5) or adjacent cells where enemy head could move.\n- Check if this is a good move:\n  - Apples near (6, 1): None directly adjacent.\n  - Enemy head could move to (2, 4), (2, 6), (1, 5), or (3, 5). No overlap.\n  - This move is also safe and keeps you in a good position.\n\n#### LEFT (x decreases):\n- New head position: (5, 2)\n- Check if this is safe:\n  - Not on boundary.\n  - Check if this is on enemy head (2, 5) or adjacent cells where enemy head could move.\n  - Enemy head is at (2, 5). Adjacent cells are (2, 4), (2, 6), (1, 5), and (3, 5). (5, 2) is not in this set.\n  - No immediate threat.\n- Check if this is a good move:\n  - Apples near (5, 2): (5, 2) is an apple! This is a direct hit.\n  - If you move to (5, 2), you will eat the apple and grow by 1 segment.\n  - This is a very good move because it directly increases your score and length.\n\n#### RIGHT (x increases):\n- New head position: (7, 2)\n- Check if this is safe:\n  - Not on boundary.\n  - Check if this is on enemy head (2, 5) or adjacent cells where enemy head could move.\n  - No overlap.\n- Check if this is a good move:\n  - Apples near (7, 2): None directly adjacent.\n  - This move is safe but does not directly lead to an apple.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **LEFT (5, 2)** is the best immediate move because it directly leads to an apple, increasing your score and length.\n- The other moves are safe but do not provide immediate gains.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n- **Next turn:** After eating the apple at (5, 2), your body will extend to (5, 2) (since you were at (6, 2) before). Your new head will be at (5, 2), and your body will be (5, 2) to (6, 2).\n- **Enemy:** Enemy is at (2, 5). They will likely try to avoid colliding with you, but we should keep an eye on their movements.\n- **Apples:** After eating (5, 2), the remaining apples are (9, 7), (4, 9), (0, 5), and (2, 9).\n- **Strategy:** Continue expanding towards apples while avoiding collisions with the enemy head.\n\n### Final Move:\nLEFT\n\n---\n**Final word:** LEFT",

This also avoids rushing toward the top-right apples and keeps me away from potential traps near the walls.\n- RIGHT or UP could still be safe but would delay reaching the nearby apple and reduce immediate gains; DOWN moves away from the nearby apple and toward less favorable territory.\n\nPlan:\n- Short-term: Move LEFT to (1,5) to set up eating the (0,5) apple on the next turn.\n- Medium/long-term: After growing, pivot toward the apples at (2,9) or (4,9) while preserving multiple safe options to avoid getting trapped, and stay away from edges when possible.\n\nLEFT",

Avoid expanding into those zones.\n4. **Apple Strategy:**\n   - **Short-term:** After (5,2), target **(0,5)** (next closest apple) via **DOWN** or **LEFT** from new head position.\n   - **Long-term:** Expand toward **(9,7)** and **(4,9)** while avoiding enemy paths. Prioritize diagonal progress (e.g., **UP-RIGHT** combinations) to cover more ground.\n5. **Collision Avoidance:**\n   - Never move into cells where enemy could reach in 1 turn (e.g., if enemy moves to (3,5), avoid (3,4) or (3,6)).\n   - Watch for your own body segments\u2014if they extend into a wall or enemy path, adjust.\n\n---\n**Final Move:** LEFT",

All other directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n   - **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n     - Head: (8,6), body: [(7,6), (6,6)].\n     - Enemy is likely moving toward (7,5) or (7,7) to avoid collision with your snake. Moving **UP** or **DOWN** could risk collision if enemy moves aggressively.\n     - Your snake\u2019s tail at (3,5) is far from enemy\u2019s head (8,6), but if enemy moves toward (7,5) or (7,7), it could block your path.\n\n3. **Safe Moves:**\n   - **UP** to (3,7): Safe, moves toward (4,8) and avoids immediate enemy threats.\n   - **LEFT** to (2,6): Safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n   - **RIGHT** to (4,6): Safe but risks enemy collision if enemy moves toward (7,5) or (7,7).\n\n4. **Enemy Movement Consideration:**\n   - Enemy\u2019s head is at (8,6). If it moves **UP** to (8,5) or **DOWN** to (8,7), it could collide with your snake\u2019s body if you move **UP** to (3,7) or **RIGHT** to (4,6).\n   - Prioritize moves that minimize enemy collision risk.\n\n5. **Best Choice:**\n   - **UP** to (3,7) is safer in the long term. It keeps the snake oriented toward apples and avoids immediate enemy threats. Moving **LEFT** to (2,6) is less optimal for apple proximity, and **RIGHT** to (4,6) risks enemy collision if enemy moves toward (7,5) or (7,7).\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Short-term:** Prioritize **UP** to (3,7) to reach the closest apple (4,8) efficiently. Monitor enemy movement toward (8,5) or (8,7) and adjust to avoid collisions.\n- **Mid-term:** From (3,7), consider **UP** or **LEFT** to reach (4,8) efficiently. Expand snake length toward (9,7) and (4,9) while avoiding enemy paths near (8,6).\n- **Long-term:** Focus on (9,7) and (4,9) while expanding the snake\u2019s reach. Use the board\u2019s open spaces to maneuver around the enemy, especially near (7,6) to avoid head-on collisions.

Their body extends toward `(8,8)`, so if you move **LEFT**, they may grow toward `(7,7)` or `(7,8)` next turn, risking collision if you expand leftward.\n\n**Apple Priorities:**\n- Closest: `(3,3)` (distance = 5 from `(3,9)`).\n- Next: `(4,5)` (distance = 4), `(5,2)` (distance = 7).\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n- **UP to `(2,9)`:** Safe, but moves away from `(3,3)` (distance = 4) and `(4,5)` (distance = 5). Enemy\u2019s head at `(7,9)` won\u2019t immediately threaten you, but their body could grow toward `(7,7)` next turn.\n- **LEFT to `(2,9)`:** Wait, no\u2014your head is at `(3,9)`, so moving **LEFT** would go to `(2,9)`. But your body is at `(4,9)`, `(4,8)`, `(3,8)`. Moving **LEFT** from `(3,9)` is `(2,9)`, which is safe. However, this moves you away from `(3,3)` (distance = 3) and `(4,5)` (distance = 5). But it\u2019s closer to `(2,9)` apple (distance = 1 from `(2,9)` to `(2,9)`? Wait, no\u2014`(2,9)` is an apple, but your head is at `(3,9)`. Moving **LEFT** to `(2,9)` is safe, but `(2,9)` is an apple! You can eat it.\n\n**Key Insight:** The apple at `(2,9)` is reachable by moving **LEFT**. This is a direct win for an apple, and it\u2019s safe. Enemy\u2019s head is at `(7,9)`, so they won\u2019t immediately threaten you.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s Next Move:** Snake `#0` will move their head **DOWN** to `(7,8)`. Their body extends toward `(8,8)`, so they won\u2019t immediately threaten you if you move **LEFT** to `(2,9)`.\n\n**Trade-off:** Moving **LEFT** to `(2,9)` is a direct apple gain, but it\u2019s a long stretch from `(3,9)` to `(2,9)`. However, it\u2019s safe and immediately beneficial.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move **LEFT** to `(2,9)` to eat the apple.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n- **Turn 19:** From `(2,9)`, prioritize **DOWN** to `(2,8)` to expand toward `(3,3)` or `(4,5)`.\n- **Turn 20:** If safe, move toward `(3,3)` or `(4,5)` based on enemy position.\n- **Monitor enemy:** If Snake `#0` grows aggressively toward `(7,7)`, shift toward `(4,5)` or `(5,2)`.\n\n---\n**Final Move:**\nLEFT",

Taking LEFT now would start a path toward it (LEFT to (3,5), then DOWN to (3,4), then DOWN to (3,3)).\n- Head-on risk: If you go LEFT to (3,5) this turn, the next turn your move would likely be DOWN to (3,4). The enemy head at (2,4) could plausibly move RIGHT to (3,4) on that turn, causing a head-on collision and both snakes to die \u2014 a risk to consider.\n- Safer alternative: Moving RIGHT to (5,5) keeps you farther from the enemy\u2019s immediate threat and aligns with potential future access to apples on the right (e.g., (9,5)) without inviting an obvious head-on with the current enemy position.\n- Decision: Prioritize safety and flexible future options. Move RIGHT this turn.\n\nPlan note for next turns (optional): If safely distanced, continue edging toward the right to chase the right-side apples while watching for opportunities to cut back toward the near apple at (3,3) only if the path stays collision-free with the enemy. Keep an eye on potential head-on turns and avoid committing to a path that pits you directly against the enemy\u2019s current heading.\n\nRIGHT",
