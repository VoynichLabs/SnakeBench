The enemy snake made a move but didn't significantly change the board state.\n\nOptions for my next move:\n\n1) Move LEFT to (8, 9) to start heading towards the apple at (9, 1).\n2) Move DOWN to (9, 8) to continue along the right wall and potentially set up for the apple at (9, 1).\n3) Move UP to (9, 0) to wrap around the top of the board and go for the apple at (9, 0).\n\nAfter evaluating the options, I believe moving DOWN to (9, 8) is the best choice. It allows me to continue along the right wall and sets me up to potentially reach the apple at (9, 1) in the next move or two. Moving LEFT to (8, 9) would start me in the direction of the apple at (9, 1), but it's a less direct path and could allow the enemy snake to block me. Moving UP to (9, 0) to wrap around for the apple at (9, 0) is tempting, but it's a risky move that could put me in a vulnerable position if the enemy snake anticipates it.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (9, 8), reassess the board state and the enemy snake's position. If the path to the apple at (9, 1) remains clear, prioritize securing that apple. However, if the enemy snake starts moving towards (9, 1), consider alternative options such as targeting the apple at (2, 1) or (1, 4). Keep in mind the overall board state and try to maintain a balance between offensive and defensive moves to maximize points while preventing the enemy snake from gaining an advantage.\n\nDOWN"
