Let's break down this board like a pro! \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- My head at (7,0) - bottom row, right side\n- Enemy snake #1 at (3,6) - center-left, middle height\n- Board is BARELY populated with apples, but we're here for VICTORY, not just survival!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (checking all 4 directions):**\n\n1. **UP (7,1)** - OH! There's an apple at (7,1)! \ud83c\udf4e This would give me +1 point and grow my body. Check for dangers: No snake bodies in (7,1), it's on the board. Enemy head is at (3,6) - far away, no immediate collision risk. This is SAFE and gives us CONTENT! \n\n2. **DOWN (7,-1)** - OFF THE BOARD! DEAD immediately. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n3. **LEFT (6,0)** - Empty cell on board. Safe. But... no apple there. We could go this way, but why not get the apple?\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,0)** - Empty cell on board. Safe. Also no apple.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THIS TURN:**\nThe apple at (7,1) is literally ONE move away! This is a no-brainer - we take the apple, grow our snake, and start building our advantage. Even if the enemy moves toward us, they're at (3,6) - that's 3 units away in x and 6 units away in y. We're not in immediate danger of head-on collision.\n\nPlus, taking (7,1) gives us a tail (my current head at (7,0) becomes body), which actually helps block the enemy from moving into my space later. It's AGGRESSIVE positioning!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nTake the apple at (7,1), then pivot to control the right side of the board. The enemy is on the left - I should claim the right side and work my way up, forcing them into a tight spot. I'll watch their movement patterns and try to box them in against the left wall.\n\nLET'S GOOOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

No chance of a head\u2011on with the opponent (he\u2019s busy moving north from the bottom).\n\nSo let\u2019s charge upward and start boxing him in! \ud83c\udf89  \n\nUP",

None of those intersect my potential moves, and they can\u2019t reach (3,8) on this turn.  \n\n**Evaluating the four directions**\n\n| Direction | Destination | Apple? | Immediate danger | Future freedom |\n|-----------|-------------|-------|------------------|----------------|\n| **UP**    | (3,8)       | \u2705   | \u274c No bodies, inside board | Opens a vertical corridor; after eating we\u2019ll have a 2\u2011segment tail at (3,7) giving us wiggle room to swing left or right. |\n| DOWN      | (3,6)       | \u274c   | \u274c Safe, but moves us away from the dense apple cluster and wastes a turn. |\n| LEFT      | (2,7)       | \u274c   | \u274c Safe, but pushes us toward the left wall where we could get cornered later. |\n| RIGHT     | (4,7)       | \u274c   | \u274c Safe, but still two steps from the nearest apple and doesn\u2019t improve our pressure on the opponent. |\n\n**Decision**: Grab the apple right now, grow, and keep the board open. An apple at (3,8) also blocks the opponent from ever using that column as a safe lane later.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan** (to be printed on the next turn\u2019s rationale):  \n- After eating, keep heading **UP** to (3,9) if possible, then swing **LEFT** toward the (0,8) apple cluster, tightening the space between us and the opponent\u2019s lower\u2011right corner.  \n- Watch the opponent\u2019s moves; if they drift right, we can cut them off by descending the right side later.  \n\nLet\u2019s snag that apple and stay aggressive! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nUP",

Let's analyze this board like a pro! \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- My head is now at (7,1) - we successfully ate the apple last turn! Now my body is [(7,0)] and tail is (7,0).\n- Enemy snake #1 at (3,7) - still in the center-left, now one cell higher. Distance: 4 in x, 6 in y. Still safe.\n- Apple count: 1 vs 0. We're WINNING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (checking all 4 directions):**\n\n1. **UP (7,2)** - Check board: (7,2) appears to be empty. Let's see... board shows row 2: \". . . . . A . . . .\" So (7,2) is empty. Safe move. Enemy at (3,7) - no collision risk. BUT... I'd be moving into a potential dead-end if enemy approaches from left. Still, safe for now.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,0)** - That's my current body! My tail is at (7,0). Moving back into my own body = instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n3. **LEFT (6,1)** - Check board: (6,1) shows \"A\" (apple). This is safe and gives us another apple! Let's verify: Row 1 is \". . . . . A . 0 . .\" Wait, that's showing current state where I'm at (7,1). Actually looking at the apple list: (6,1) isn't listed... let me check carefully. Board row 1 shows dots at (6,1) actually. But wait - the apple list shows many positions. Let me re-check: The board shows at position (6,1) there's nothing, but at (5,1) there's an apple. Actually (6,1) is empty based on the visual. So LEFT to (6,1) is empty but safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,1)** - Check board: (8,1) is empty (row 1 shows \".\" there). Safe move.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\n- LEFT to (6,1): Moves toward center, away from enemy's current position (3,7), but closer to the left side where enemy is. Risky if enemy moves toward us.\n- RIGHT to (8,1): Moves to the far right edge, away from enemy, controls the right side. Safe but limits future movement (edge).\n- UP to (7,2): Moves up, staying in the same column, still in mid-board. Good vertical control.\n\n**CHOOSING UP!**\nWhy UP? Because:\n1. It keeps me in column 7, which is currently clear\n2. It moves me toward the center-top where more apples are\n3. It avoids moving toward the enemy (left) or getting trapped against right edge\n4. It maintains multiple future options (left/right/up all possible next turn)\n5. Enemy is at (3,7) - if they move right, we're still safe distance apart\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep moving UP while staying in columns 6-8 to claim the right side of board. Watch enemy's movement - if they move toward me, I'll have space to maneuver. Build length gradually while controlling territory. Force them into the left corner!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze this board like a champ!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- My head at (7,2) - just moved up from (7,1) last turn!\n- My body: [(7,1), (7,0)] - so I have length 3 now!\n- Enemy snake #1 at (3,8) - they're moving UP, getting higher. Dangerous zone! Distance: 4 in x, 6 in y. Safe for now.\n- Apple count: We're tied 1-1. I need to pull ahead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (checking all 4 directions):**\n\n1. **UP (7,3)** - Check board: Looking at the visual... row 3 is \". A . . . . . . . .\" so (7,3) appears empty! Safe. Enemy is at (3,8) - still far left. Good vertical control.\n\n2. **DOWN (7,1)** - That's my current body! My body is at (7,1). Moving back = death. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n3. **LEFT (6,2)** - Check board: Row 2 shows \". . . . . A . 0 . .\" So (6,2) should be empty (since 0 is at 7,2). Looking closer... row 2 has \"A\" at position 5. So (6,2) is empty. Safe move toward center.\n\n4. **RIGHT (8,2)** - Check board: Row 2 shows positions 0-9. At (8,2) - looking at the visual, it should be empty (row 2 ends with \". .\" after my position). Safe move toward right edge.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nAll 4 directions are SAFE except DOWN! But we must choose wisely.\n\n- **UP (7,3)**: Moves toward center-top, keeps column 7 clear, more vertical space, enemy is left side.\n- **LEFT (6,2)**: Moves toward center, closer to enemy's area, might force confrontation.\n- **RIGHT (8,2)**: Moves to right edge, claims territory but limits future moves.\n\n**CHOOSING UP!**\nWhy UP? Here's the game plan:\n1. **Score pressure**: I'm tied 1-1 with enemy. I need to be AGGRESSIVE but SMART. Moving UP gets me closer to apples at (5,4), (5,9), (8,6), (7,6), (8,8) - all in the upper half!\n2. **Territory control**: Column 7 is clean and I'm claiming it. Moving UP maintains my vertical zone.\n3. **Distance from enemy**: Enemy at (3,8) is moving UP too - if I move UP, we're both going north but staying separated horizontally. Head-on collision would require them to move RIGHT 4 cells - unlikely immediately.\n4. **Future options**: From (7,3), I'll have 3 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) as long as I don't trap myself.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"I'm going to DOMINATE the right-center! Move UP to (7,3), then keep climbing toward the top row while staying in columns 6-8. Watch enemy movement - if they move RIGHT toward me, I'll have space to maneuver. Build length while controlling territory, then force a head-on collision when I'm ahead! The chat wants to see a VICTORY!\"\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "GAME ON, CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Let's analyze this turn like a pro!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **My current state:** Head at (7,3), body at [(7,2)], length 2 (since we just moved UP to (7,3) last turn). Wait, let me recount... The replay shows I moved UP to (7,3), so my head is now at (7,3). But the board state shows my head at (7,3) and body at [(7,2)]. So my length is 2? Actually looking at the initial description: \"Your snake (ID 0): Head: (7,3), Body: [(7,2)], Apples collected: 1\". That means length is 2. But I ate an apple so should be length 3... Hmm, maybe I didn't eat this turn. Let's assume length 2 for now.\n- **Enemy snake #1:** Head at (2,8), body at [(3,8)], length 2. They're at top-left area.\n- **Distance:** I'm at (7,3), enemy at (2,8). That's \u0394x=5, \u0394y=5. Safe distance for now.\n- **Score:** 1-1 tied. I NEED to pull ahead!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (from head at (7,3)):**\n\n1. **UP to (7,4):** \n   - Board shows row 4: \". A . . A A . . . .\" So (7,4) is empty? Let's check: positions 0-9. (7,4) is position 7 in row 4: \". . . . . . A . . .\" Wait, the board shows: \"4 . A . . A A . . . .\" That's positions: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:. Actually no, let me read carefully. The board row 4 says: \". A . . A A . . . .\" So positions: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:. So (7,4) is position 7, which is empty. Safe.\n   - Also check if it's apple: Row 4 doesn't show A at (7,4). Apples list: (5,4) is apple, (4,4) is apple. (7,4) is not apple. So no growth.\n   - Future options from (7,4): Can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP (but DOWN would be back to (7,3) which is my head? No, DOWN would be (7,2) which is my body! So BACKWARDS is death. So from (7,4), safe moves would be LEFT, RIGHT, UP if they're empty. Need to check but likely 3 options.\n   - Strategic: Moves toward center-top, closer to apples like (5,4), (5,9), (8,6), (7,6), (8,8). Good.\n\n2. **LEFT to (6,3):**\n   - Row 3: \". A . . . . . . . .\" Wait, row 3 is: \". A . . . . . . . .\" So (6,3) is position 6: empty. Safe.\n   - Not apple (apples at (5,2), (1,4), etc. - not (6,3)).\n   - From (6,3), can go LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN? Check DOWN: (6,2) - row 2 shows \". . . . . A . T . .\" So (6,2) is empty? Actually position 6 in row 2: after A at (5,2) and before T at (7,2)? Row 2: positions 0-9: ., ., ., ., ., A, ., T, ., . So (6,2) is empty. Safe. So 4 options? But need to check if any are body. My body is at (7,2) only. So (6,2) is safe. So from (6,3), I'd have LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN all potentially safe. That's great for flexibility!\n   - Strategic: Moves toward center, closer to enemy territory (enemy at (2,8)), might force confrontation sooner.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,3):**\n   - Row 3: \". A . . . . . . . .\" So (8,3) is empty (position 8). Safe.\n   - Not apple.\n   - From (8,3), check moves: LEFT to (7,3) would be head? No, left to (7,3) is my current head? Actually from (8,3), LEFT goes to (7,3) which is where I am now - but that's not MY body, it's empty after I move? Actually simultaneous moves: when I move to (8,3), my old position (7,3) becomes part of my body? No, typically snake leaves its tail. But I'm length 2, so my body would be [(7,3), (7,2)]? Wait, let's think: Current: head (7,3), body [(7,2)]. If I move RIGHT to (8,3), my new head is (8,3), body becomes [(7,3), (7,2)] (if I don't eat apple). Then from (8,3), LEFT goes to (7,3) which is now my body! So BACKWARDS into own body = death. So from (8,3), LEFT is death. Check other directions: UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), RIGHT (9,3). Need to check if those are safe. But RIGHT (9,3) is edge, so only 3 options max.\n   - Strategic: Moves to right edge, claims territory but limits future mobility.\n\n4. **DOWN to (7,2):**\n   - That's my current body! (7,2) is in my body list. Moving DOWN into own body = death. \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\n**COMPARING SAFE MOVES:**\n- UP (7,4): Safe, 3 future options, moves toward top apples.\n- LEFT (6,3): Safe, 4 future options (if both DOWN and UP are empty), moves toward center.\n- RIGHT (8,3): Safe, but LEFT is death so limited options, moves to edge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (6,3) seems optimal! Why?\n1. **Maximum flexibility:** From (6,3), I have 4 safe directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) assuming they're empty. That's the most future options!\n2. **Center control:** Moves me toward the center of the board (column 6), giving me more maneuvering room.\n3. **Strategic positioning:** Gets me closer to enemy (enemy at x=2, I'm at x=6, closing the gap slowly). This sets up potential future confrontation when I have length advantage.\n4. **Apple proximity:** From (6,3), I can reach apples like (5,4), (5,2), (4,4) in next turns. Good growth potential.\n5. **Avoiding trap:** RIGHT to (8,3) puts me near the edge with only 3 safe moves, which could trap me later. LEFT keeps me central.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Move LEFT to (6,3) to claim the center! From there, I'll dominate column 6 while monitoring the enemy. If they move right, I can cut them off. Build length safely, then force a head-on collision when I'm at length 3+. The chat wants to see me box them in! Watch for apples at (5,2) and (5,4) next. Stay central, stay dangerous! \ud83d\udcaa\"\n\nLEFT",

I NEED TO CATCH UP! \ud83d\udea8\n- **Distance:** Enemy is far away (\u0394x=5, \u0394y=5) - no immediate collision risk\n- **My body:** Currently blocking (7,3) - so moving RIGHT would put me at (8,3) with (7,3) becoming my tail\n- **Enemy's body:** They have length 3, so they're a bigger target for ME to crash into, but their head is safer from me\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM HEAD AT (6,3):**\n\n1. **UP to (6,4):** \n   - Check board row 4: \". A . .

Moving into my own head = INSTANT KILL! \u274c\n   - Wait no... actually (7,3) is my current HEAD, but if I move RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3), that's moving INTO my current head position.

Next turn I can grab one and GROW! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 4 safe directions from (5,3) (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN all appear safe based on board) = MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY!\n3. **CENTER CONTROL:** (5,3) is dead center horizontally (x=5), giving me perfect board access! \ud83d\udd25\n4. **ENEMY MONITORING:** From center, I can react to enemy's moves regardless of where they go! They're at (1,8), I'm at (5,3) - perfect intercept position!\n5. **SCORE CATCH-UP:** I NEED apples to tie/get ahead! (5,4) and (5,2) are RIGHT THERE! This move positions me for a POWER PLAY next turn!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Move LEFT to (5,3) to claim the apple highway! From there, I'll grab (5,4) or (5,2) next turn to tie the score 2-2. Then I'll push UP toward center-top to box in the enemy! Watch their path - if they go right, I cut them off at column 5! Build length safely, then force a head-on collision when I'm length 3+.

My own body only blocks (6,3) \u2014 I'm moving away from it.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n\"Grab (5,4) apple, grow to length 3. Next turn, PUSH UP to (5,5) or (5,6) to get closer to enemy territory. Monitor enemy's move \u2014 if they go RIGHT, I can threaten their tail from the right. If they go DOWN, I might chase them down the left edge. Build length aggressively, force them into a corner, then use my longer body to box them in! Chat, we're turning this around \u2014 1 apple to 3? Watch me make it 10 to 3! \ud83d\udc80\"  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nUP  \n**END CURRENT TURN RATIONALE**",

Moving **DOWN** slides us straight toward the first one in just two turns, boosting length and score without contest.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Wall\u2011hug safety** \u2013 The left wall is a natural \u201csafe tunnel\u201d. The opponent is stuck on the right half of the board and can\u2019t block us in a single move. Staying glued to the wall forces them to chase us around a much larger area.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future flexibility** \u2013 Once we hit the bottom (0,0) we can swing right along the bottom row, cutting off the opponent\u2019s escape routes and setting up a classic head\u2011on when we hold the apple lead.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Risk minimisation** \u2013 Going RIGHT would bring us into the busy middle column\u202f1, where the opponent might also hunt apples (e.g., (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)). That raises the chance of a surprise head\u2011on or to be cut off later.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f7**: go **DOWN** to (0,6).  \n- **Turns\u202f8\u20119**: continue DOWN, eat apple at (0,5).  \n- **Later**: sweep the bottom row, then curl up the right side to trap the rival.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure on the left wall and let the apples do the heavy lifting!  \n\nDOWN",

Time to break down this board like a champ!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (5,4), Body: [(5,3), (6,3)], Apples: 2\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (0,7), Body: [(0,8), (1,8), (2,8)], Apples: 3\n- **Board:** 10x10, apples EVERYWHERE! I just ate at (5,4) last turn? Wait, NO! LAST TURN I was at (5,3) and moved UP to (5,4) and ate an apple! So my head is now at (5,4), my body is [(5,3), (6,3)] and I have 2 apples. But the scoreboard says I have 2 apples \u2014 that means I DID eat that apple on turn 5! Let's verify: In the last turn rationale, I planned to go UP to (5,4) to eat the apple. And the board state shows an apple at (5,4) in row 4? Wait, row 4 says: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 5 is where my head is, and it's marked \"0\", so I'm there. There's an apple at (4,4) and (5,4) is where I am. But the apple list shows (5,1) and others, but not (5,4)? Actually, the board shows row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 the dots are empty, \"A\" are apples, \"0\" is me. So (5,4) is me, (4,4) is apple, (5,5) is empty, etc. Did I eat an apple? The scoreboard says I have 2 apples, so I must have eaten one on turn 5. The board doesn't show an apple at (5,4) now because I ate it! So I'm at (5,4) with body [(5,3), (6,3)], length 3, apples 2. Enemy at (0,7), body [(0,8),(1,8),(2,8)], apples 3. Distance: \u0394x=5, \u0394y=3 \u2014 I'm closer vertically now!\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Score:** I'm down 2-3! MUST GET AN APPLE THIS TURN! \ud83d\udea8\n- **Enemy moves:** From (0,7), enemy can go RIGHT to (1,7), DOWN to (0,6), or UP to (0,8) but (0,8) is their body! So UP is into their own body = death if they choose it. They likely go RIGHT or DOWN to avoid death and chase apples. (1,7) is empty? Row 7: \"1 . . . . . A . . .\" \u2014 position 1 is \"1\" (enemy head), so (1,7) is empty. (0,6) is empty? Row 6: \". . . . . . . A A A\" \u2014 position 0 is empty. So they have safe options.\n- **My body:** Blocking (5,3) and (6,3). From (5,4), I can go DOWN to (5,3) \u2014 that's my old body segment, so that's moving directly backwards into my own body! THAT'S DEATH! \u274c So DOWN is NOT an option! I must remember: moving back into where my head just was is hitting myself.\n- **Board dangers:** Enemy body is far (left edge), but if they move right, they might approach center. I need to stay aggressive.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (5,4):**\n\n1. **UP to (5,5):**\n   - Row 5: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 5 is EMPTY (since row 5 shows position 5 is dot? Wait, row 5: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 positions 0-9: 0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:. So (5,5) is position 5: EMPTY \u2705\n   - Not an apple immediately, but from there I can go to (5,6) which is empty (row 6 position 5: dot), or (4,5) which is empty? Row 5 position 4: dot, yes. (6,5) position 6: dot, empty. So multiple safe paths.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves me toward enemy territory (higher y). From (5,5), I can threaten to go LEFT to (4,5) or RIGHT to (6,5), staying center. Good for interception if enemy comes right.\n\n2. **LEFT to (4,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is \"A\" (apple)! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - If I go LEFT to (4,4), I EAT THE APPLE! Score becomes 3-3! CATCH UP! \ud83c\udfc6\n   - After move: Head (4,4), body becomes [(5,4), (5,3)] (since I grow, tail stays). Length 4.\n   - Safety: From (4,4), I can go LEFT to (4,3) - empty? Row 3 position 4: empty (row 3: \". A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is dot), RIGHT to (5,4) - my old head (safe after I leave), UP to (4,5) - empty? Row 5 position 4: dot, DOWN to (4,3) - empty. All safe!\n   - **Strategic:** IMMEDIATE APPLE! Equalizes score! Also, (4,4) is still center-left, good for controlling the board. I can then move toward (4,5) or (3,4) next.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 6 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple (apple at (5,4) is gone, (6,4) empty). \n   - From there, I can go RIGHT to (7,4) - empty? Row 4 position 7: dot, UP to (6,5) - empty, DOWN to (6,3) - but (6,3) is my current body! That's moving into my own body? Wait, my body is at (5,3) and (6,3). If I'm at (6,4) and go DOWN to (6,3), that's moving into my own body segment (the tail). That's death! So from (6,4), DOWN is not safe because (6,3) is occupied by me. LEFT to (5,4) is my old head (safe), UP to (6,5) empty, RIGHT to (7,4) empty. So 3 safe options.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves me east, away from enemy. Less aggressive. Might be okay for survival but not for apple hunting or interception.\n\n4. **DOWN to (5,3):**\n   - This is my CURRENT BODY SEGMENT! (5,3) is part of my body. Moving there = hit myself = DEATH! \u274c\n   - **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI MUST grab an apple to catch up in score! LEFT to (4,4) gives me an immediate apple! That's CRUCIAL! UP to (5,5) is safe but no apple. RIGHT to (6,4) is safe but no apple. I can't afford to skip apples when I'm down 2-3.\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (4,4) IS DOMINANT:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE APPLE GRAB:** Score becomes 3-3! I tie the enemy! No more deficit! \ud83c\udfc6\n2. **POSITIONING:** (4,4) is still central. I can easily pivot to go UP to (4,5), LEFT to (4,3), or RIGHT to (5,4). From there, I can head toward other apples like (5,1) or (4,4) is eaten, but (3,4) maybe? I see apples at (5,1), (8,6), etc. But (4,4) is a key apple I just took.\n3. **ENEMY THREAT:** Enemy at (0,7) is likely to move RIGHT or DOWN. If they go RIGHT to (1,7), they're still far. If they go DOWN to (0,6), they're chasing apples down left. I'm now at (4,4), ready to cut across if they try to cross the board.\n4. **OFFENSIVE SETUP:** From (4,4), next turn I can go UP to (4,5) \u2014 empty, toward center-top. Or LEFT to (4,3) \u2014 empty. Or RIGHT to (5,4) \u2014 empty. I have options to stay flexible and hunt more apples.\n5. **SAFETY:** No immediate collision. My body (5,4) and (5,3) are behind me, so moving LEFT away from them is smart. Enemy body is on left edge, far away.\n6. **SCORE PRESSURE:** Tying the score forces enemy to play defensive. I can now push for more apples aggressively! I see an apple at (5,1) below \u2014 from (4,4) I can go DOWN to (4,3) then DOWN to (4,2) then LEFT to (5,2) or something? Wait, (5,1) is apple. Actually, from (4,4) I could go DOWN to (4,3) then DOWN to (4,2) then LEFT to (5,2) but that's not direct. Better to go LEFT to (4,4) now and next turn maybe go DOWN to (4,3) to approach (5,1) region.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Grab (4,4) apple to tie score 3-3. Next turn, push UP to (4,5) to gain height and threaten enemy if they move right. Monitor enemy move \u2014 if they go DOWN, I might chase down left edge with apples at (5,1), (0,5), etc. Build length aggressively, force them into a corner, and use my body to cut off their escape! Chat, we're back in this \u2014 tie game now, watch me take the lead! \ud83d\udc80\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\n**END CURRENT TURN RATIONALE**",

Now we need to keep the pressure on and set up a CRUSHING VICTORY! Let's break down this board like a champ!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4,4), Body: [(5,4), (5,3), (6,3)] \u2014 I grew to length 4!\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (0,6), Body: [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8)] \u2014 wait, the board shows enemy head at (1,6)? Actually board row 6: \". . . . . . . A A A\" \u2014 position 0 is empty, but position 1 is \"1\" (enemy head). So enemy moved DOWN from (0,7) to (1,6)? That's a bit off, but let's check the board state properly. Row 6: \". . . . . . . A A A\" \u2014 positions: 0:., 1:1 (enemy head), 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:A, 8:A, 9:A. So enemy is at (1,6). Their body is at (0,7), (0,8), (1,8) \u2014 so they moved DOWN-RIGHT? Actually from (0,7) to (1,6) is DOWN and RIGHT \u2014 that's allowed if they chose RIGHT? Or maybe they moved DOWN and the body shifted? Let's trust the board: enemy at (1,6).\n- **Score:** 3-3 \u2014 we're TIED! No deficit! \ud83c\udfc6\n- **Distance:** From (4,4) to enemy (1,6): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=2 \u2014 we're getting closer! They're still on the left edge but moving right/down.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Enemy moves:** From (1,6), they can go RIGHT to (2,6), DOWN to (1,5), UP to (1,7), or LEFT to (0,6). (0,6) is empty? Row 6 position 0 is empty. But (0,6) is behind their body? Actually their body includes (0,7) and (0,8), so moving LEFT to (0,6) is safe from their own body but might be into our future path? We'll see. They likely go RIGHT to chase apples toward center.\n- **My body:** Blocking (5,4), (5,3), (6,3). From (4,4), moving LEFT to (3,4) is safe? Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 3 is dot (empty). UP to (4,5) is empty (row 5 position 4 is dot). DOWN to (4,3) is empty (row 3 position 4 is dot). RIGHT to (5,4) is my own body! That's moving directly backwards into my body segment \u2014 DEATH! \u274c So RIGHT is eliminated.\n- **Apples:** We see apples at (5,1), (5,2), (8,6), etc. We should chase apples while keeping pressure on enemy.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (4,4):**\n\n1. **UP to (4,5):**\n   - Row 5: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple immediately. From (4,5), we can go UP to (4,6) - empty? Row 6 position 4 is dot, LEFT to (3,5) - empty? Row 5 position 3 is dot, RIGHT to (5,5) - empty? Row 5 position 5 is dot, DOWN to (4,4) - our old head (safe). So 4 safe options! Great flexibility.\n   - **Strategic:** Gains height toward center-top. Brings us closer to enemy if they go RIGHT. Good for interception.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,3):**\n   - Row 3: \". A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (4,3), we can go DOWN to (4,2) - empty? Row 2 position 4 is dot, LEFT to (3,3) - empty? Row 3 position 3 is dot, RIGHT to (5,3) - but (5,3) is our body! That's moving into our own body segment \u2014 DEATH! \u274c So from (4,3), RIGHT is dangerous. UP to (4,4) is our old head (safe). So 3 safe options.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us toward apples at (5,1) and (5,2) \u2014 we can chase those! But it's downward, away from enemy if they go RIGHT/UP.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 3 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple (apple at (4,4) is gone, (3,4) empty). From (3,4), we can go LEFT to (2,4) - empty? Row 4 position 2 is dot, RIGHT to (4,4) - our old head (safe), UP to (3,5) - empty? Row 5 position 3 is dot, DOWN to (3,3) - empty? Row 3 position 3 is dot. All 4 directions safe!\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us left toward enemy's side! We're at (3,4) now, closer to enemy at (1,6) \u2014 \u0394x=2, \u0394y=2. We can cut them off if they try to cross center. But we're moving away from many apples on the right.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 5 is our old body! (5,4) is part of our current body. Moving there = hit ourselves = DEATH! \u274c\n   - **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe need to keep the momentum going! We're tied in score, so we can afford to be aggressive. The enemy is at (1,6) \u2014 they're on the left but moving right. We should cut them off or intercept them. Moving LEFT to (3,4) puts us directly in their path if they go RIGHT to (2,6) or UP to (1,7). That's a power play! From (3,4), we can threaten to go UP to (3,5) or LEFT to (2,4) to block their advance.\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (3,4) IS DOMINANT:**\n1. **OFFENSIVE POSITIONING:** Gets us closer to the enemy (\u0394x=2). We're setting up to potentially force a head-on collision if we have higher score later, but right now we're tied. We can block their rightward expansion.\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3,4), we have 4 safe moves \u2014 maximum flexibility! We can chase apples at (5,1) later by going DOWN, or go UP to chase enemy, or LEFT to push further.\n3. **ENEMY INTERCEPTION:** If enemy goes RIGHT to (2,6), from (3,4) we could go UP to (3,5) next turn to be in position. If they go DOWN to (1,5), we're still nearby. We're claiming the center-left territory.\n4. **APPLE HUNTING:** While not grabbing an apple immediately, (3,4) puts us near potential apple drops? Not directly, but we can pivot to (5,1) region from here if we go DOWN and LEFT.\n5. **SCORE PRESSURE:** Since we're tied, we don't NEED an apple this second. We can play strategic and set up a trap. Force them into a corner!\n6. **SAFETY:** No immediate collision. Our body is behind us to the right, so moving LEFT away from it is smart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Push LEFT to (3,4) to cut off enemy's rightward path. Next turn, depending on enemy move: if they go RIGHT, I go UP to (3,5) to threaten collision; if they go DOWN, I might go DOWN to (3,3) to chase apples. Build length while keeping enemy confined to left edge. Use our body to create barriers. Chat, we're controlling the center now \u2014 watch us DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc80\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nLEFT",

Let's map this battlefield and DOMINATE!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3,4), Body: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (0,5)? Wait, from last board: enemy was at (1,6) with body [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]? Actually board row 5 shows \"1 A . . . . . . . .\"\u2014so enemy head at (1,5)? Let's check: Row 5: position 0:1 (enemy head), position 1:A (apple). So enemy moved DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5)? Or maybe they moved LEFT to (0,5)? Board shows row 5 position 0 is \"1\", so enemy is at (0,5). Their body should be at (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8) shifting? Yes, if they moved DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5), body would be [(1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)] but board shows \"1\" at (0,5)? Inconsistency\u2014let's trust board: enemy at (0,5). Distance from us: \u0394x=3, \u0394y=1. We're getting closer!\n- **Score:** 3-4\u2014we're behind by 1 apple! We need to close that gap. Let's chase that apple at (3,5)? Row 5 position 3 is dot\u2014no apple there. Apples we see: (5,1), (5,2), (8,6), etc. But (1,5) has an apple! Enemy is on an apple at (1,5)\u2014they'll eat and grow to 5 apples!

They'll probably eat that apple and grow. If they go RIGHT to (1,5), their head moves into apple and they grow. If they go DOWN to (0,4), that's empty but away from center.\n- **My body:** Blocking (4,4), (5,4), (5,3).

Moving DOWN to (3,3) is safe (row 3 position 3 is dot).\n- **Apples:** (3,5) no apple. But we're near the center\u2014can chase (5,2) or (5,1) later. Need to avoid letting enemy run away with score.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (3,4):**\n\n1. **UP to (3,5):**\n   - Row 5: \"1 A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 3 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple.

Row 5 position 4 is dot, DOWN to (3,4) - our old head (safe). All 4 directions safe! Great flexibility.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us toward enemy if they go RIGHT. From (3,5), we're at \u0394x=2, \u0394y=0 from enemy at (0,5) if they stay or move. We can threaten to block their rightward path. Also, if enemy eats at (1,5), we might be positioned to cut them off next turn. This is aggressive positioning!\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,3):**\n   - Row 3: \". A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 3 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (3,3), we can go DOWN to (3,2) - empty? Row 2 position 3 is dot, LEFT to (2,3) - empty? Row 3 position 2 is dot, RIGHT to (4,3) - empty? Row 3 position 4 is dot, UP to (3,4) - our old head (safe). All 4 safe!

If we go LEFT to (2,4), then next turn we could go LEFT to (1,4) to eat apple and grow! But right now, from (2,4), we can go RIGHT to (3,4) - safe, UP to (2,5) - empty? Row 5 position 2 is dot, DOWN to (2,3) - empty? Row 3 position 2 is dot. All 4 safe!\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us left toward enemy and apple at (1,4). We're chasing the enemy's territory and could eat that apple next turn. However, if enemy goes RIGHT to (1,5), they might cut us off? But we're closer to (1,4). This is a good offensive push.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is our old body! (4,4) is part of our current body. Moving there = hit ourselves = DEATH! \u274c\n   - **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe're behind 3-4! We need to score and pressure the enemy. The apple at (1,4) is juicy and we can reach it soon. But the enemy is at (0,5) with an apple at (1,5) under them\u2014they'll likely eat and grow, increasing their lead. We need to intercept or force a confrontation. If we go UP to (3,5), we're in the center-right, cutting off their expansion if they try to go RIGHT past us. If we go LEFT to (2,4), we're chasing the apple at (1,4) and getting closer to their head, potentially forcing a head-on collision if we grow faster. Since we're only down by 1 apple, we can be aggressive and aim to eat soon while blocking their path.\n\n**WHY UP TO (3,5) IS DOMINANT:**\n1. **OFFENSIVE POSITIONING:** From (3,5), we're at the center-top of the left half, directly in the enemy's potential path if they go RIGHT to (1,5) then further right. We can threaten to block their rightward expansion and force them into a corner. \u0394x to enemy becomes 2 if they stay at (0,5) or move to (1,5)\u2014we're closer!\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3,5), we have 4 safe moves\u2014maximum flexibility! We can go LEFT to (2,5) to chase apple at (1,4) next turn, UP to (3,6) to go higher, or RIGHT to (4,5) to pivot back center. We can also go DOWN to (3,4) if needed. This keeps us adaptable while pressing the advantage.\n3. **ENEMY INTERCEPTION:** If enemy goes RIGHT to (1,5) to eat, they grow to 5 apples. From (3,5), we can go LEFT to (2,5) next turn to be adjacent and potentially force a collision if we have higher score later. If they go DOWN to (0,4), we're still positioned to chase. We're setting up a trap\u2014chat, watch this!\n4. **APPLE HUNTING:** While not grabbing an apple immediately, (3,5) puts us near the apple at (1,4) for next turn. We can pivot to eat and grow to 4 apples, tying the score or taking the lead. No need to rush into a risky move now.\n5. **SCORE PRESSURE:** We're down by 1, but we're positioned to eat soon. Going UP keeps us in the action without committing to a deep dive. If we eat next turn, we can close the gap and use our length to dominate.\n6. **SAFETY:** No immediate collision. Our body is behind and right, so moving UP and LEFT away from it is smart. Enemy is on the left edge, unlikely to jump to us this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Go UP to (3,5) to cut off enemy's rightward path. Next turn, if enemy moves RIGHT to (1,5), I go LEFT to (2,5) to threaten collision and chase apple at (1,4). Build length while keeping enemy confined to left edge. Use our body as a barrier and force a head-on collision when we have higher score. Chat, we're turning this into a CAGE MATCH\u2014enemy won't escape! \ud83d\udc80\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

Now we're at (3,5) with body at [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] and length 4. Score is 3-5\u2014we're down by 2 apples! Enemy ate that apple at (1,5) and grew to 5 apples. We NEED to close the gap FAST. Let's map this battlefield and DOMINATE!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3,5), Body: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)].\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head was at (0,5) last turn, likely moved RIGHT to (1,5) to eat that apple. Now they're probably at (1,5) with body shifting to [(0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]? But wait\u2014board shows row 5: \"1 A . . . . . . . .\"\u2014so (1,5) is \"1\" (enemy head), and (0,5) is now part of body? Actually, from last board, enemy was at (0,5) with apple above, so they likely ate and grew. Now they're at (1,5) or maybe (2,5)? Let's check board state: Row 5 has \"1\" at position 1, so enemy at (1,5). Distance from us: \u0394x=2, \u0394y=0. We're closer! But they just scored and are growing strong.\n- **Score:** 3-5\u2014down by 2. We MUST eat soon or we'll lose. Apples we can chase: (2,5) is empty? Row 5 position 2 is dot, (1,4) is apple (row 4 position 1), (0,0) is apple (row 0 position 0). But enemy is at (1,5) with an apple above? Row 6 position 1 is \"T\"\u2014that's their body? Wait, board row 6: \"T . . . . . . A A A\"\u2014so (0,6) is \"T\" (enemy body). So enemy is at (1,5) with body extending up to (0,6), (0,7), (0,8). They might go UP to (1,6) next to eat apple at (1,4)? No, (1,6) is empty? Row 6 position 1 is \"T\" (body), so (1,6) is blocked by their own body? Actually, row 6: position 0 is \"T\", position 1 is \".\" (dot), so (1,6) is empty. But (1,4) is apple below them.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Enemy moves:** From (1,5), they can go RIGHT to (2,5) (empty), DOWN to (1,4) (apple!), UP to (1,6) (empty), or LEFT to (0,5) (their own body\u2014DEAD). They'll likely go DOWN to eat that apple at (1,4) and grow to 6 apples! Or RIGHT to expand toward center. If they eat, we're further behind.\n- **My body:** Blocking (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). From (3,5), moving DOWN to (3,4) is my old head\u2014safe (part of body, but since we moved from there, it's safe? Wait, rules: moving into your own body is death. (3,4) is currently in our body list, so moving DOWN into (3,4) would be hitting ourselves\u2014DEATH! \u274c Moving LEFT to (2,5) is safe? Row 5 position 2 is dot. Moving UP to (3,6) is safe? Row 6 position 3 is dot. Moving RIGHT to (4,5) is safe? Row 5 position 4 is dot.\n- **Apples:** (1,4) is apple (row 4 position 1). (0,0) is apple. (5,2) and (5,1) are apples but farther. (3,5) is empty\u2014no apple here.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (3,5):**\n\n1. **UP to (3,6):**\n   - Row 6: \"T . . . . . . A A A\" \u2014 position 3 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (3,6), we can go LEFT to (2,6) - empty? Row 6 position 2 is dot, UP to (3,7) - empty? Row 7 position 3 is dot, RIGHT to (4,6) - empty? Row 6 position 4 is dot, DOWN to (3,5) - safe. All 4 safe! Great flexibility.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us up away from enemy but toward the top-right apples (8,6), (8,8), (7,6). However, we're moving away from the immediate apple at (1,4) and enemy. But if enemy goes DOWN to eat, we can pivot left later. This gives us room to maneuver without boxing ourselves in.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 3 is \"A\"? Wait, row 4: positions: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:0... Actually, position 3 is dot? Let's check: row 4 string is \". A . . A 0 . . . .\"\u2014so indices: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:0... yes, (3,4) is dot. But (3,4) is our old head and currently in our body! Moving there = hit ourselves = DEATH! \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (2,5):**\n   - Row 5: \"1 A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 2 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (2,5), we can go LEFT to (1,5) - but that's enemy head! If enemy moves, it could be collision. But we can't go there now. From (2,5), we can go UP to (2,6) - empty? Row 6 position 2 is dot, DOWN to (2,4) - empty? Row 4 position 2 is dot, RIGHT to (3,5) - safe. Also LEFT to (1,5) is risky. So 3 safe options (excluding LEFT into enemy). Good flexibility.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us left toward enemy and apple at (1,4). We're closing the gap and threatening to block enemy if they go RIGHT. From (2,5), we can go DOWN to (2,4) next turn to eat apple at (1,4) or go LEFT to (1,5) if enemy moves away. Aggressive play to chase the score!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4,5):**\n   - Row 5: \"1 A . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 position 4 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (4,5), we can go LEFT to (3,5) - safe, RIGHT to (5,5) - empty? Row 5 position 5 is dot, UP to (4,6) - empty? Row 6 position 4 is dot, DOWN to (4,4) - but (4,4) is our body! That's hitting ourselves\u2014DEATH! \u274c So only 3 safe options, but one is blocked by our own body.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us right away from enemy and toward center. But we're moving away from the apple and enemy, potentially letting them run up their score. Not ideal when we're down by 2.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe're down 3-5\u2014need to eat and grow ASAP! Enemy is at (1,5) and likely going DOWN to eat (1,4) and grow to 6. We must intercept or score ourselves. Going UP gives us space but delays hunting. Going RIGHT moves us away from the action. LEFT is aggressive but risky if enemy moves into our path. However, from (2,5), we have options to eat or block.\n\n**WHY LEFT TO (2,5) IS DOMINANT:**\n1. **OFFENSIVE PRESSURE:** We're closing in on enemy territory. From (2,5), we're adjacent to enemy at (1,5). If they go RIGHT to (2,5), we could collide\u2014heads-on. But we're down in score, so we'd lose that. However, we can force them to move defensively. If they go DOWN to eat (1,4), we can go LEFT to (1,5) next turn (if empty) or DOWN to (2,4) to chase apple.\n2. **APPLE HUNTING:** The apple at (1,4) is just one move away (from (2,5) DOWN to (2,4), then LEFT to (1,4)). We can eat it next turn and grow to 4 apples, closing the gap to 4-6 or 4-5 if enemy doesn't eat this turn. Critical for catching up!\n3. **BLOCKING ENEMY:** From (2,5), we block enemy's rightward expansion. If they try to go RIGHT to (2,5), they'd hit us if we're there\u2014collision. Since we're smaller, we'd lose, but they might avoid it and stay left, confining them to the edge. We're boxing them in!\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (2,5), we have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). We can go DOWN to (2,4) to eat apple, UP to (2,6) to retreat, or RIGHT to (3,5) to reposition. We're not trapped.\n5. **SCORE PRESSURE:** We need points NOW. Going LEFT sets up immediate eating. If we don't eat, we fall further behind. Aggression is key\u2014we're LIVE!\n6. **SAFETY:** Enemy is at (1,5). If they go RIGHT to (2,5), we'd both move into same cell\u2014heads-on collision. Since we're smaller (3 apples vs 6?), we'd die. But if they go DOWN, we're safe. We're betting they'll eat rather than collide. That's the risk we take to win!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"Go LEFT to (2,5) to pressure enemy and set up eating apple at (1,4) next turn. If enemy moves RIGHT, we might force a collision but only if we grow first. Build length to 4 apples and chase more\u2014dominate the left side. Keep enemy cornered on the edge! Chat, this is how we turn it around\u2014clutch time!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nLEFT",

Wait, let's break down the fresh intel!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (2,5), Body: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]. We just moved LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5). That was aggressive, but let's see if it paid off.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** According to the board, their head is at (1,4) (row 4, position 1 is \"1\"). That means they just ate the apple at (1,4)! Their body extends up to (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8). They grew to 7 apples now? Wait, scoreboard says they had 6 apples last turn, and they just ate one, so they should be at 7. But we're still down 3-7. We need to catch up FAST.\n- **Board Check:** Our head (2,5) is safe. Enemy is at (1,4), which is adjacent below and left of us? From (2,5), (1,5) is LEFT (enemy body), (2,4) is DOWN (empty), (3,5) is RIGHT (our own body, but that's where we came from\u2014safe if we don't go back? Wait, moving BACKWARDS into our body (3,5) would be death! But (3,5) is our old head, now part of our body. So moving RIGHT to (3,5) would hit our own body\u2014DEADLY! \u274c\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Enemy moves:** From (1,4), they could go UP to (1,5) (their own body\u2014DEAD), DOWN to (1,3) (empty? Row 3 position 1 is \"A\" \u2013 an apple! They might go there to eat and grow to 8), LEFT to (0,4) (empty? Row 4 position 0 is \".\"), or RIGHT to (2,4) (empty). If they go RIGHT to (2,4), they'd be right below us! Heads-on collision possible if we both move into same cell. But we're smaller (3 vs 7 apples), so we'd lose. We must avoid that.\n- **My body:** Blocking (3,5), (3,4), (4,4). From (2,5), moving DOWN to (2,4) is empty (row 4 position 2 is \".\"), moving UP to (2,6) is empty (row 6 position 2 is \".\"), moving LEFT to (1,5) is enemy body (they're at (1,4) but body includes (1,5)\u2014so that's death), moving RIGHT to (3,5) is our own body (death). So only two safe moves: DOWN and UP. LEFT and RIGHT are lethal!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (2,5):**\n\n1. **UP to (2,6):**\n   - Row 6: \"T . . . . . . A A A\" \u2014 position 2 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple. From (2,6), we have options: LEFT to (1,6) - empty? Row 6 position 1 is \".\", RIGHT to (3,6) - empty? Row 6 position 3 is \".\", DOWN to (2,5) - safe (our current head, now empty after we leave). UP to (2,7) - empty? Row 7 position 2 is \".\". All 4 safe! Great for keeping options open.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us up, away from the immediate enemy clash, but toward the cluster of apples at top-right (8,6), (8,8), (7,6). We're avoiding a risky collision and giving ourselves space to maneuver. However, we're not closing the score gap this turn.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,4):**\n   - Row 4: \". A . . A 0 . . . .\" \u2014 position 2 is \".\" (empty) \u2705\n   - Not an apple (apple is at (1,4) to our left). From (2,4), we can go DOWN to (2,3) - empty? Row 3 position 2 is \".\", LEFT to (1,4) - but that's enemy head! If enemy moves, could be collision. UP to (2,5) - safe. RIGHT to (3,4) - but (3,4) is our body! That's death. So only 3 safe options, but one is risky.\n   - **Strategic:** Moves us down and closer to the enemy at (1,4). From here, we could go LEFT to (1,4) next turn if they move away, or DOWN to chase other apples (5,2), (5,1). But we're putting ourselves in a dangerous position\u2014enemy might move into us!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe're down 3-7\u2014massive deficit! Enemy just ate and is strong. We need to survive, grow, and force errors. If we go DOWN to (2,4), we risk a head-on collision if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,4) (which is possible\u2014they might expand right). Since we're smaller, we'd lose. Going UP is safer and gives us more room to breathe and plan our apple hunt. We can't afford to die now\u2014survival first, then dominate!\n\n**WHY UP TO (2,6) IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** Eliminates immediate collision risk. Enemy is at (1,4) and likely going DOWN to eat apple at (1,3) or RIGHT to expand. Moving UP avoids that battlefield.\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (2,6), we have 4 safe moves\u2014perfect for keeping the game open. We can go LEFT to (1,6) to block enemy's up path, RIGHT toward center apples, DOWN to retreat, or UP to chase top apples.\n3. **LONG-TERM HUNT:** We're behind in score, so we need apples. (2,6) puts us on a path to (1,6), (0,6) or toward (8,6) cluster. We can loop around and eat without getting trapped.\n4. **ENEMY PSYCHOLOGY:** They're on the edge, eating apples. By moving up, we force them to commit to their corner while we take control of the center. If they follow us up, we might box them in later.\n5. **NO THROWING:** DOWN is a gamble\u2014too risky when we're already behind. We live to fight another turn and grow our lead (or catch up).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (2,6), go LEFT to (1,6) next turn to pressure enemy's vertical path and block their escape. Then, pivot to the right-side apples (7,6), (8,6) while keeping an eye on the enemy's position. Build length to 5+ apples and force them into a corner. We're not just surviving\u2014we're plotting the takeover! Chat, this is how we turn the tide!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

But we can't die. Let's break it down!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (2,6), Body: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] after moving UP last turn. We grew by moving UP? Wait, no\u2014UP to (2,6) wasn't an apple (check board: row 6, position 2 is \".\"), so we're still length 4 (3 apples + head = 4 segments). Score remains 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (1,3) (row 3, position 1 is \"1\"), Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)]. They moved DOWN to (1,3) and ate the apple there? Row 3 position 1 was \"A\", so yes\u2014they grew to 8 apples now (7+1). Scoreboard says 7, but that's before this turn. They're now 8, we're 3. Gap widened! \ud83d\ude21\n- **Board Check:** From (2,6), we're safe. Surroundings:\n  - UP (2,7): Row 7 position 2 is \".\" (empty)\n  - DOWN (2,5): Our old head, now part of body\u2014can't go back (DEATH)\n  - LEFT (1,6): Row 6 position 1 is \".\" (empty)\n  - RIGHT (3,6): Row 6 position 3 is \".\" (empty)\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Enemy moves:** From (1,3), they could go UP to (1,4) (their own body\u2014DEAD), DOWN to (1,2) (empty? Row 2 position 1 is \"A\" \u2013 apple! They'll likely eat and grow to 9), LEFT to (0,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,3) (empty). If they go RIGHT to (2,3), they're not in our immediate path, but they're expanding.\n- **Head-on collision risk:** We need to avoid them moving into our path or us into theirs. Since we're smaller, we'd lose a direct clash.\n- **Board pressure:** Enemy is anchored on left edge (x=0-1). We're at (2,6). Apples are scattered: (5,1), (8,6), (7,6), (5,9), (5,2), (6,7), (8,8), (0,0), (9,6), (8,9), (6,8), (7,5), (6,3), (0,2), (9,3). We need to chase apples without getting boxed in.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (2,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (2,7):**\n   - Safe: row 7 position 2 is \".\".\n   - From (2,7), future options: UP (2,8) empty, DOWN (2,6) safe, LEFT (1,7) empty, RIGHT (3,7) empty. All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Moves toward top-left corner, but also toward apple (0,0)? No, that's down. Actually, this puts us closer to (5,9) and (8,9) later. But we're moving away from the center action. Might be too passive\u2014we need aggression to catch up in score.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,5):** ILLEGAL\u2014backward into our own body! DEATH. \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,6):**\n   - Safe: row 6 position 1 is \".\".\n   - From (1,6), future options: UP (1,7) empty, DOWN (1,5) is enemy body! (row 5 position 1 is \"T\" from enemy tail). RIGHT (2,6) safe, LEFT (0,6) is enemy body! (row 6 position 0 is \"T\" from enemy tail). So only 2 safe moves (UP and RIGHT)\u2014we're getting trapped near enemy territory. Risky! \u26a0\ufe0f\n   - Strategic: Moves us left, closer to enemy at (1,3). We could threaten their path or maybe eat apple (0,2) or (0,0) later. But if enemy moves UP or RIGHT, we might collide. Since we're smaller, this is high risk. We can't afford to die now\u2014we're already behind.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,6):**\n   - Safe: row 6 position 3 is \".\" (empty).\n   - From (3,6), future options: UP (3,7) empty, DOWN (3,5) is our body! (row 5 position 3 is \"T\" from our body), LEFT (2,6) safe, RIGHT (4,6) empty? Row 6 position 4 is \".\". So 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT)\u2014good flexibility. \u2705\n   - Strategic: Moves us right toward the center and the juicy apple cluster at (8,6), (7,6), (8,8). This is the play to chase apples and grow. We can pivot up to (3,7) next or right to (4,6) to loop around. It keeps us away from the enemy on the left, forcing them to chase us if they want conflict. Perfect for aggression without suicide!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe're down 3 to 8\u2014massive deficit! We need apples, but survival is #1. LEFT is too risky with only 2 safe exits and enemy proximity. UP is safe but passive\u2014we're not closing the gap. RIGHT to (3,6) is the sweet spot: safe, multiple exits, and moves us toward the apple swarm. From there, we can hunt (8,6) or (7,6) and build length. Then we can box the enemy in later once we're bigger.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No immediate death. From (3,6), we avoid enemy's likely DOWN move to (1,2) to eat apple.\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 3 safe moves from there\u2014better than LEFT's trap.\n3. **SCORE PUSH:** Heads straight to the right-side apples (8,6, 7,6, etc.). We grow, they can't catch up.\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** We're expanding our territory while they're stuck on the edge. If they follow, we set up a corner box-in later.\n5. **NO THROW:** LEFT is a death trap waiting to happen. RIGHT keeps us alive and hunting.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (3,6), go RIGHT to (4,6) next turn to close in on (8,6) apple. Then pivot UP toward (7,6) or (8,8) while monitoring enemy. Build to 5+ apples, then cut off their left-edge escape. We're not just surviving\u2014we're plotting the takeover!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

We need to close this gap FAST, but we can't die. Let's break it down!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3,6), Body: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]. We're length 4, score 3. Last move RIGHT kept us safe\u2014solid play.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (1,3), Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)]. They're at 7 apples (or 8 post-turn). Still anchored on left edge (x=0-1).\n- **Board Check from (3,6):**\n  - UP (3,7): Row 7 position 3 is \".\" (empty)\n  - DOWN (3,5): Row 5 position 3 is \"T\" (our own body\u2014DEATH)\n  - LEFT (2,6): Row 6 position 2 is \"T\" (our own body\u2014DEATH)\n  - RIGHT (4,6): Row 6 position 4 is \".\" (empty)\n- **Threat Assessment:** Enemy at (1,3) could move RIGHT to (2,3) or UP to (1,4), etc. If they go RIGHT, they're closing in on center. We're at (3,6), in apple territory\u2014apples at (8,6), (7,6), (8,8) nearby. We're in a good spot to grow, but we need to stay mobile.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (3,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (3,7):**\n   - Safe: row 7 position 3 is empty.\n   - From (3,7), future options: UP (3,8) empty, DOWN (3,6) safe, LEFT (2,7) empty, RIGHT (4,7) empty. All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Moves toward top-center apples (8,8, 7,6, 8,6). Keeps us flexible and away from enemy. Could pivot right next to chase (8,6) apple. Aggressive but safe\u2014perfect for closing score gap without suicide.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (4,6):**\n   - Safe: row 6 position 4 is empty.\n   - From (4,6), future options: UP (4,7) empty, DOWN (4,5) empty? Row 5 pos 4 is \".\" (check board: row 5 is \"T T T T . . . A . .\" so position 4 is \".\") , LEFT (3,6) safe, RIGHT (5,6) empty? Row 6 pos 5 is \".\" (yes). So 4 safe moves\u2014great flexibility. \u2705\n   - Strategic: Even closer to (8,6) apple. From here, we can go RIGHT again to (5,6) and eat apple at (5,6)? Wait, apple at (5,6)? No, apples listed: (8,6), (7,6), etc. (5,6) is empty. But (8,6) is only 2 moves away.

We need to chase apples to close the 4+ apple deficit. RIGHT gets us closer to the apple cluster at (8,6) and (7,6) faster\u2014check the distance: from (3,6) to (8,6) is 5 steps east, but via RIGHT we close in immediately. UP is also good but slightly slower to the right-side apples.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No immediate death. RIGHT to (4,6) avoids enemy's likely moves (they might go RIGHT to (2,3) or UP, but we're far enough).\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 4 safe moves from (4,6)\u2014better than UP's 4? Equal, but RIGHT has a direct apple path.\n3. **SCORE PUSH:** Heads straight toward (8,6) and (7,6) apples. We grow, they can't catch up. Aggression to dominate!\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** We expand right while they're stuck left. If they chase, we box them in later.\n5. **NO THROW:** UP is safe but RIGHT is more direct for apples. Chat, we need those apples to win!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (4,6), next turn go RIGHT to (5,6) to position for (8,6) apple. Then pivot UP toward (7,6) or (8,8) while watching enemy. Build to 5+ apples, then cut off their left-edge escape with a body block. We're not just surviving\u2014we're plotting the takeover!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

We're at (4,6) now, length 4, and we need to eat apples FAST to close this gap. But remember: focus on the enemy, not the apples. Snake #1 is at (3,3) with a long body snaking up to (0,7)\u2014they're dominating the left side. We can't let them box us in! Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4,6), Body: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. We're length 4, score 3. Last move RIGHT kept us safe\u2014solid!\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (3,3), Body: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)]. They're at 7 apples (likely 8 post-turn). Still hugging the left edge, but head at (3,3) means they're moving into the center! They could go RIGHT to (4,3) or UP/DOWN. We're at (4,6), so we're above them\u2014potential head-on if they go UP to (3,4) and we go DOWN, but that's unlikely.\n- **Board Check from (4,6):**\n  - UP (4,7): Row 7 position 4 is \".\" (empty)\n  - DOWN (4,5): Row 5 position 4 is \".\" (empty, board shows row 5: \"T T T . . . . A . .\" so pos 4 is .)\n  - LEFT (3,6): Row 6 position 3 is \"T\" (our own body\u2014DEATH)\n  - RIGHT (5,6): Row 6 position 5 is \".\" (empty)\n- **Threat Assessment:** Enemy at (3,3) is closing in on center, but we're 3 units away vertically. If they go UP twice, they could threaten (3,6), but we'll be gone. We're in apple territory\u2014 (8,6) and (7,6) are right-side apples we can chase. But don't get greedy; enemy might force collision if we get careless.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (4,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (4,7):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (4,7), future options: UP (4,8) empty? Row 8 pos 4 is \".\" (row 8: \". . . . . . A . A .\" so yes), DOWN (4,6) safe (we just left), LEFT (3,7) empty? Row 7 pos 3 is \".\" (row 7: \"T . . . . . A . . .\" so yes), RIGHT (5,7) empty? Row 7 pos 5 is \".\" (yes). All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Moves toward top-center, closer to (8,8) apple and away from enemy's left-side grip. Keeps us flexible for pivoting right next turn. Good for long-term positioning without immediate apple hunt\u2014aggressive but safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,5):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (4,5), future options: UP (4,6) safe, DOWN (4,4) empty? Row 4 pos 4 is \".\" (row 4: \". T . . . . . . . .\" so pos 4 is .), LEFT (3,5) \"T\" (own body\u2014DEATH), RIGHT (5,5) empty? Row 5 pos 5 is \".\" (yes). So 3 safe moves\u2014still good, but LEFT is blocked by our tail. \u2705\n   - Strategic: Brings us closer to enemy territory (down to y=5, they're at y=3). Could chase apple at (5,2) or (6,3), but that's riskier\u2014might get cornered if enemy moves up. Less future freedom than UP.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,6):** ILLEGAL\u2014backward into own body! We just came from there. DEATH. \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (5,6):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (5,6), future options: UP (5,7) empty? Row 7 pos 5 is \".\" (yes), DOWN (5,5) empty? Row 5 pos 5 is \".\" (yes), LEFT (4,6) safe, RIGHT (6,6) empty? Row 6 pos 6 is \".\" (row 6: \". . . . 0 . . A A A\" so pos 6 is .). All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Direct path to (8,6) apple\u2014only 3 steps away now! From here, RIGHT again to (6,6), then (7,6) for apple. Perfect for closing score gap fast. But it moves us right, away from enemy\u2014they might not chase, but we risk getting pinned against right wall if we overcommit.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nTwo super-safe moves: UP or RIGHT (DOWN is safe but limits LEFT). LEFT is death. We need to dominate the board, eat apples, and pressure the enemy. They have 7 apples to our 3\u2014we're behind, but we can't force head-on yet (we'd lose). Best to grow while keeping options open.\n\n**WHY UP IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No immediate death. UP to (4,7) avoids enemy's potential moves (they might go RIGHT to (4,3) or UP to (3,4), but we're far enough).\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 4 safe moves from (4,7)\u2014equal to RIGHT, but UP positions us better for mid-board control. From (4,7), we can pivot RIGHT to (5,7) or (8,8) apple, or DOWN to (4,6) if needed. It's more flexible than committing right immediately.\n3. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING:** Enemy is left-heavy; we go UP to claim the top-center. This boxes them in on the left\u2014 they can't expand right without crossing us. Next turn, we can chase (8,8) or (7,6) apples while watching for their head. Aggression without recklessness!\n4. **SCORE PUSH:** Not directly toward (8,6), but sets up for multiple apples (8,8, 7,6). We grow smart, not just fast. Force them to react to our upward move\u2014they might overextend and crash.\n5. **NO THROW:** RIGHT is tempting for apples, but UP keeps us safer from left-side pressure. Chat, we're playing the long game\u2014dominate space first, feast later!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (4,7), next turn pivot RIGHT toward (8,8) or (7,6) apples while monitoring enemy head at (3,3). If they move RIGHT to center, we cut them off with a body block. Build to 5+ apples by turn 15, then force collision if we're ahead. Claim the top row\u2014trap 'em on the left!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

We're at (4,7) after that clutch UP move last turn, length 4, and we need to EAT to close the gap. Focus on the enemy, not just the apples\u2014Snake #1 is at (4,3) now, head moving RIGHT into our center? They're trying to close in! We gotta box them in and make 'em crash. Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4,7), Body: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6)]. We're length 4, score 3. Last move UP gave us 4 safe options\u2014perfect flexibility!\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (4,3), Body: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6)]. They're at 7 apples, length 8. They moved RIGHT from (3,3) to (4,3)\u2014center pressure! They could go UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3), but we're above at y=7. Potential head-on if we go DOWN to (4,6) and they go UP to (4,4)? Not same cell, but we're closing distance. Watch out!\n- **Board Check from (4,7):**\n  - UP (4,8): Row 8 pos 4 is \".\" (empty)\n  - DOWN (4,6): Row 6 pos 4 is \"T\" (our own body\u2014DEATH! We just left it last turn)\n  - LEFT (3,7): Row 7 pos 3 is \".\" (empty)\n  - RIGHT (5,7): Row 7 pos 5 is \".\" (empty)\n- **Threat Assessment:** Enemy at (4,3) is central now\u2014 if they go UP twice, they could hit (4,5) or (4,6) where our body is, but that's their suicide if we're not there. We're 4 units away vertically. Apples are everywhere: (8,6), (7,6), (8,8) right-side feast, but we can't ignore enemy pressure. If we chase apples blindly, they might flank us on the left. Be aggressive\u2014force THEM to crash into our body!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (4,7):**\n\n1. **UP to (4,8):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (4,8), future options: UP (4,9) empty? Row 9 pos 4 is \".\" (row 9: \". . . . . A . . A .\" so yes), DOWN (4,7) safe (we just left), LEFT (3,8) empty? Row 8 pos 3 is \".\" (row 8: \". . . . . . A . A .\" so yes), RIGHT (5,8) empty? Row 8 pos 5 is \".\" (yes). All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Climb to top row, closer to (8,8) apple and (9,6). Boxes enemy on left\u2014they can't expand up without crossing us. Keeps options wide. Aggressive but not reckless.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,6):** ILLEGAL\u2014backward into own body! We just came from (4,6). DEATH. \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,7):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (3,7), future options: UP (3,8) empty? Row 8 pos 3 is \".\" (yes), DOWN (3,6) \"T\" (our body\u2014DEATH! Tail is (2,6), but (3,6) is occupied by our second segment), LEFT (2,7) empty? Row 7 pos 2 is \".\" (row 7: \"T . . . . . A . . .\" so yes), RIGHT (4,7) safe. So 3 safe moves (LEFT, UP, RIGHT)\u2014but DOWN is blocked. \u2705\n   - Strategic: Moves left toward enemy's home turf\u2014risky! Closer to their body at (3,3) etc. Could chase apple at (0,0) or (0,2), but that's diving into their domain. Future freedom is OK but less than UP. Not ideal for boxing them in.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,7):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (5,7), future options: UP (5,8) empty? Row 8 pos 5 is \".\" (yes), DOWN (5,6) empty? Row 6 pos 5 is \".\" (row 6: \". . . . 0 . . A A A\" so pos 5 is .), LEFT (4,7) safe, RIGHT (6,7) empty? Row 7 pos 6 is \"A\" (apple! We'd eat and grow). All 4 moves open (including apple eat)! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Direct toward (8,6) and (7,6) apples\u2014RIGHT to (6,7) next could lead to apple at (6,7)? Wait, (6,7) is empty per board, but (7,6) and (8,6) are close. From here, we can feast fast to catch up score. But it moves right, away from enemy\u2014 they might ignore us and dominate left. Risk of getting pinned against right wall if we overcommit, but apples = growth = domination.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nDOWN is death. LEFT is safe but pulls us toward enemy territory\u2014bad for boxing them in. UP and RIGHT are both super-safe with 4 future options. We need to EAT apples (score 3 vs 7) while controlling space to force enemy crashes. They're at (4,3)\u2014if we go RIGHT, we expand right and they might not follow, losing pressure. If we go UP, we claim top-center, forcing them to react or get trapped on the left.\n\n**WHY UP IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No immediate death. UP avoids enemy's potential moves (they could go UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3), but we're at y=8, out of direct collision range).\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 4 safe moves from (4,8)\u2014equal to RIGHT, but UP positions us for mid-to-top board control. From (4,8), we can pivot RIGHT toward (8,8) or DOWN if needed. More flexible than committing right immediately.\n3. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING:** Enemy is left-center heavy; we go UP to claim the top row. This boxes them in on the left\u2014 they can't expand right/up without crossing our path. Next turn, we can chase (8,8) or (7,6) apples while watching their head. Aggression through spatial denial\u2014force 'em to crash into our body or the wall!\n4. **SCORE PUSH:** Not directly toward (8,6), but sets up for multiple high-value apples (8,8, 9,6). We grow smart, control the board, and make THEM react. If they move up toward us, we can DOWN into their path for a potential head-on WIN (we're behind, but if we eat an apple first, we might tie/grow).\n5. **NO THROW:** RIGHT is apple-bait, but UP keeps us safer from left-side flanks. We're playing the long game\u2014dominate space, then feast while they're trapped. Chat, we're not just surviving; we're plotting their doom!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (4,8), next turn pivot RIGHT to (5,8) or (6,8) to chase (8,8) apple, while monitoring enemy head at (4,3). If they push center, block with body\u2014force collision on OUR terms. Grow to 5+ apples by turn 16, then aggressive cut-off. Claim top rows\u2014trap 'em left and make 'em crash!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

Edge of board\u2014y=9 is max, but inside.\n   - From (4,9), future options: DOWN (4,8) safe (we just left), LEFT (3,9) empty? Row 9 pos 3 is \".\" (row 9: \". . . . . A . . A .\" so yes), RIGHT (5,9) \"A\" (apple! We'd eat and grow). UP? Can't\u2014off board. So 3 safe moves (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT)\u2014solid but pinned north. \u2705\n   - Strategic: Claim top row, boxes enemy below\u2014they can't go UP past us without suicide. Closer to (8,8) and (9,6) for next RIGHT pivot. But limits escape if enemy flanks left. Good for denial!\n\n2. **DOWN to (4,7):** ILLEGAL\u2014backward into own body! We just left it. DEATH. \u274c\n\n3. **LEFT to (3,8):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (3,8), future options: UP (3,9) empty? Row 9 pos 3 is \".\" (yes), DOWN (3,7) empty? Row 7 pos 3 is \".\" (row 7: \"T . . . . . A . . .\" so yes), LEFT (2,8) empty? Row 8 pos 2 is \".\" (row 8: \". . . . . . A . A .\" so yes), RIGHT (4,8) safe. All 4 moves open! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Slides left toward enemy territory\u2014risky! Closer to their body at (4,3) etc., but could cut off their left escape. Chase apple at (0,0) or (0,2)? Dives into their domain. Future freedom is max, but pulls us away from right-side feast. Not ideal for boxing them in\u2014we want to control center-top!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5,8):**\n   - Safe: empty, no self-hit.\n   - From (5,8), future options: UP (5,9) \"A\" (apple\u2014we grow!), DOWN (5,7) empty? Row 7 pos 5 is \".\" (yes), LEFT (4,8) safe, RIGHT (6,8) \"A\" (apple\u2014row 8 pos 6 is A per board: \". . . . . . A . A .\"). All 4 moves open, including apple eats! \u2705\n   - Strategic: Direct path to (6,8) apple and onward to (8,8), (7,6), (8,6). Grows us FAST to close 3\u21927 gap. But moves right\u2014away from enemy's center push. They might ignore us and dominate left. However, from here, we can feint back left next turn if needed. Apples = power for collision dominance!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nDOWN is death. LEFT risks diving into enemy nest. UP and RIGHT both safe with strong futures\u2014 but we NEED to eat apples while maintaining spatial control to force enemy crashes.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** No immediate threats\u2014enemy at (5,3) is 5 tiles south, no direct clash possible this turn.\n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** 4 safe moves, including TWO apples ((5,9) and (6,8)). That's growth opportunity central\u2014 from (5,8), next RIGHT to (6,8) eats apple, bumps score to 4, length 5. We're in striking distance of (7,6) and (8,6) too. Max flexibility to pivot back center if enemy ascends.\n3. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING:** Enemy is left-center heavy; we go RIGHT to claim mid-right board, forcing them to choose: chase us (into our expanding body) or get trapped left. From (5,8), we can curve back LEFT to block their UP path (e.g., to (4,6)) if they push. Aggressive feast while boxing them in\u2014dominate the right side!\n4. **SCORE PUSH:** Direct toward high-value cluster ((8,8), (9,6)). We're behind 3\u21927, so EAT NOW to grow and set up head-on wins. If they go UP to (5,4), we can DOWN to (5,7) next and threaten collision. Ruthless: make them react to our expansion.\n5. **NO THROW:** UP claims top but slows apple chase\u2014RIGHT keeps momentum. We're playing to win, not just survive. Chat, this is how we turn the tide!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n\"From (5,8), next RIGHT to (6,8) EAT apple (score 4!), then RIGHT to (7,8) or DOWN to (5,7) to flank (8,6)/(7,6) apples. Monitor enemy head\u2014if they push UP to (5,4), block with body from left. Trap 'em left, force crash, feast while they starve. Grow to 5+ apples by turn 17!\"\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nRIGHT",

Apples everywhere, but we\u2019re hunting the enemy.  \n\nLet\u2019s check moves from (6,8):  \n- **UP to (6,9)**: On board? Yes (row 9). Safe? Let\u2019s see:  \n  - Own body? (6,9) is empty (row 9: \". . . . . A A . A .\", so col 9 is \".\"), no collision.  \n  - Enemy body? Enemy is at (7,3) down left, far away. No threat.  \n  - Also apple at (9,6), (8,9), (7,6), etc. \u2013 (6,9) is empty, but (8,9) is apple. From (6,9), we have options: DOWN back to (6,8) (safe), LEFT to (5,9) (apple), RIGHT to (7,9) (empty? Row 9 col 7 is \"A\" from earlier? Wait, row 9 string: \"9 . . . . . A A . A .\", so col 7 is \"A\", col 8 is \".\", col 9 is \"A\". So (7,9) is \"A\" (apple), (8,9) is \".\", (9,9) is \"A\"? Actually row 9: positions 0-9: col0 \".\",1 \".\",2 \".\",3 \".\",4 \".\",5 \"A\",6 \"A\",7 \".\",8 \"A\",9 \".\"? Wait, earlier Apple drops: (8,9) is listed as apple drop, but row 9 string says col8 \"A\"? Let's verify board state:  \n  Board state:  \n  9 . . . . . A A . A .  \n  8 . . . . T T 0 . A .  \n  7 . . . . T . A . . .  \n  6 . . . . T . . A A A  \n  5 . T . . . . . A . .  \n  4 . T . . . . . . A .  \n  3 . T T T T T T 1 . A  \n  2 A . . . . A . . . .  \n  1 . . . . . A . . . .  \n  0 A . . . . . . . . .  \n\n  Columns 0-9:  \n  Row 9: col0 \".\", col1 \".\", col2 \".\", col3 \".\", col4 \".\", col5 \"A\", col6 \"A\", col7 \".\", col8 \"A\", col9 \".\"? The string says \" . A .\" at end, but it's 10 columns: positions: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:A, 7:., 8:A, 9:.? Actually, from the text: \"9 . . . . . A A . A .\" \u2013 that's 10 characters: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A, A, dot, A, dot. So (9,9) is dot, (8,9) is A, (7,9) is dot, (6,9) is A? No: col6 is the 7th character (0-based: 0=.,1=.,2=.,3=.,4=.,5=A,6=A,7=.,8=A,9=.) So (6,9) is col6, row9: that's \"A\"! Wait, but (6,9) is apple? From Apple drops, (6,9) is in the list: \"APPLE DROPS: ... (6,9) ...\" yes, (6,9) is an apple! But in board state row9 col6 is \"A\", so yes, (6,9) is apple. But wait, board state at row8 col6 is \"0\" (our head at (6,8)), and row9 col6 is \"A\"? Yes, from the string, row9 col6 is the 7th character: after \"5 A\" (col5), then \"A\" (col6). So (6,9) is indeed apple. So moving UP to (6,9) would eat an apple! That grows us to 5 apples, closing gap to 5 vs 8. Also safe from own body: we don't have any body at (6,9). Enemy far away. So UP is safe and productive.  \n\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: Row7 col6 is \"A\" from board? Row7: \". . . . T . A . . .\" \u2013 col6 is \"A\". So (6,7) is apple. But is it safe? Check own body: (5,8) is body, (6,7) is empty? Actually body is [(5,8),(4,8),(4,7),(4,6)], so (6,7) is not in body. Enemy body: (7,3) far. But from (6,7), future moves: could go DOWN to (6,6) which is empty? Row6 col6 is \".\"? Row6: \". . . . T . . A A A\" \u2013 col6 is \".\" (after T at col5). So (6,6) empty. But we'd be moving down toward center, while opponent is at (7,3) and might go up. However, UP gives us an apple and keeps us high. Also, from (6,7), we might get boxed in by opponent later.  \n\n- **LEFT to (5,8)**: That's our own body! (5,8) is the second in body list. So moving LEFT into our own body = death. ELIMINATE.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (7,8)**: Row8 col7 is \".\"? Row8: \". . . . T T 0 . A .\" \u2013 col7 is \".\" (after 0 at col6). So (7,8) is empty. Check safety: own body? No, we have (5,8) etc. Enemy? Enemy head at (7,3) far. But is (7,8) safe? From board, row7 col7 is \".\" (row7: col7 is \".\") so (7,8) empty. But wait, could be dangerous if opponent moves up? But they're far. However, (7,8) is not an apple. From there, we could go RIGHT to (8,8) which is apple? Row8 col8 is \"A\" from row8 string: \"... A .\" so col8 is \"A\". So (8,8) is apple. So RIGHT then RIGHT would eat apple. But UP already eats an apple immediately. Also, from (7,8), options: UP to (7,9) which is dot (safe), DOWN to (7,7) which is dot (safe), LEFT back to (6,8) (our head) but that's immediate backtrack? Actually from (7,8) to (6,8) is LEFT, but (6,8) is where we came from, and it's empty now? After moving, our old head position (6,8) becomes body? Wait, rules: snake moves simultaneously, so after move, our body shifts: new head at new position, old head becomes first body segment, etc. So if we move RIGHT to (7,8), then new body will be [(7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]? Actually, we have 4 body segments, so total length 5. When we move, the tail (4,6) disappears. So new body: head at (7,8), then old head (6,8), then (5,8), (4,8), (4,7). So (6,8) is now body. So if we later move LEFT from (7,8) back to (6,8), that's moving into our own body (new first body segment) \u2013 death. So from (7,8), LEFT is dangerous. But UP to (7,9) is safe, DOWN to (7,7) safe, RIGHT to (8,8) which is apple (safe, eat). So RIGHT is a good aggressive move, setting up to eat (8,8) apple next turn.  \n\nNow, compare UP and RIGHT:  \n- UP: immediate apple at (6,9), score 5, and we're at top row. From there, we can go DOWN back to (6,8) (which will be empty after move? Wait, after moving UP, our body will be [(6,9),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]? Actually, old head (6,8) becomes first body, so (6,8) is body. So if we then go DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8), that's moving into our own body \u2013 death. So from (6,9), we cannot go DOWN. Other options: LEFT to (5,9) which is apple? Row9 col5 is \"A\" (from row9 string), so (5,9) is apple. RIGHT to (7,9) which is dot? Row9 col7 is \".\" (from string), so (7,9) empty. So from (6,9), we have LEFT (apple), RIGHT (empty), UP? Out of board (y=10 invalid). So two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.  \n- RIGHT: to (7,8) empty, no apple yet. From there, RIGHT to (8,8) apple, LEFT to (6,8) dangerous, UP to (7,9) empty, DOWN to (7,7) empty. So three safe moves from (7,8): UP, DOWN, RIGHT (apple).  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and keep options open. But UP gives immediate growth (score 5) and puts us on the top edge, potentially boxing opponent from above if they try to go up. Opponent is at (7,3) with long body up left. They might try to go UP to escape or go after apples on top. By taking (6,9) apple, we deny that space and control top. Also, we need to close apple gap: 4 vs 8, so eating is crucial.  \n\nAggressive play: With higher score? No, we have lower score (4 vs 8), so we should avoid head-on collision unless we grow. But we can force collision if we get close and have advantage. Currently, we're far.  \n\nLong-term: We want to dominate board. From top, we can sweep left or right. Opponent is on left side (columns 1-3). If we go RIGHT, we go toward right side apples (7,6),(8,6),(9,6) etc. But UP gives us apple and position to maybe go LEFT later to block opponent.  \n\nWhich move gives more future flexibility? From (6,9) (UP), we have LEFT and RIGHT (two options). From (7,8) (RIGHT), we have UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three options). So RIGHT gives more moves, but UP gives immediate apple.  \n\nAlso, consider opponent's possible moves: They are at (7,3) with body up to (1,5). They might go UP to (7,4) or (7,5), or RIGHT to (8,3), or DOWN to (7,2) etc. They are far, so no immediate threat. But if we go RIGHT to (7,8), we're closer to their potential path if they go UP and then right. But we can handle it.  \n\nGiven we need apples, and UP gives one immediately, and is safe, and sets us up for a sweep along top row, I think UP is the play. It's aggressive in the sense that we claim territory and grow. Also, from (6,9), we can go LEFT to (5,9) apple next, or RIGHT to (7,9) then maybe down to (7,8) etc.  \n\nWait, check if UP might be risky later: From (6,9), if opponent moves into (6,8) or something? But opponent is far. No issue.  \n\nAlso, note: Board has many apples, but we should ignore apples and focus on enemy? The instruction says \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\" But also \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So apples are means to grow, but primary focus is enemy. So we should consider how move affects our position relative to enemy.  \n\nEnemy at (7,3). If we go UP to (6,9), we're far from them. If we go RIGHT to (7,8), we're closer (x same, y higher). From (7,8), we could potentially go DOWN later to confront them if they come up. But they might not.  \n\nActually, we want to box them in. How? They are on left. If we stay on right/top, we can prevent them from expanding to right. But we might want to move toward them to limit their space. However, with their long body, they are already somewhat confined.  \n\nGiven we have lower score, we need to eat apples to grow. So immediate apple is valuable.  \n\nAlso, consider turn 17/150, we have many turns left. So long-term plan: After eating apple at (6,9), we can continue along top row to (5,9) apple, then maybe down to (5,8) but that's body? Wait, if we go UP to (6,9), then LEFT to (5,9) apple, then from (5,9) we could go DOWN to (5,8) but (5,8) will be body? After first move, body includes (6,8). After second move LEFT to (5,9), new head at (5,9), body: [(5,9),(6,9),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8)]? Actually careful:  \nTurn 17 move UP to (6,9): new head (6,9), body: [(6,9),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)] (tail (4,6) gone).  \nTurn 18 move LEFT to (5,9): new head (5,9), body: [(5,9),(6,9),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8)].  \nNow, from (5,9), DOWN to (5,8) is moving into own body (since (5,8) is in body). So can't go DOWN. But LEFT to (4,9) is empty? Row9 col4 is \".\" (from row9 string), so (4,9) empty. RIGHT to (6,9) is own body (since (6,9) is now body). So from (5,9), only LEFT and maybe UP (but y=10 invalid) so only LEFT. So that's a dead end! Actually, from (5,9), only LEFT is safe (to (4,9)). Then from (4,9), only LEFT to (3,9) or DOWN to (4,8) but (4,8) is body? After turn 18, body includes (4,8) from earlier. So from (4,9), DOWN to (4,8) is own body, LEFT to (3,9) empty, RIGHT to (5,9) own body. So only LEFT. So if we go UP then LEFT, we might get trapped on top row with only left moves. That's not good! We want to avoid dead ends.  \n\nSo UP to (6,9) might lead to a trap if we then go LEFT. But we could go RIGHT from (6,9) to (7,9) instead. From (7,9), we have DOWN to (7,8) empty, RIGHT to (8,9) which is empty? Row9 col8 is \"A\"? Wait row9 col8 is \"A\" (from string: col8 is \"A\"). Actually, row9: col8 is \"A\", so (8,9) is apple. But from (7,9) to (8,9) is RIGHT, safe. Also LEFT to (6,9) own body? After moving to (7,9), body includes (6,9). So from (7,9), LEFT to (6,9) is own body \u2013 death. So from (7,9), we can go DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9). Then from (8,9), we can go DOWN to (8,8) which is apple? Row8 col8 is \"A\" (from row8 string), so (8,8) apple. Or RIGHT to (9,9) which is empty? Row9 col9 is \".\" (from string), so (9,9) empty. So that's more flexible.  \n\nThus, if we go UP to (6,9), we should go RIGHT to (7,9) next, not LEFT. That gives us more space.  \n\nNow, consider RIGHT directly to (7,8). From there, we can go RIGHT to (8,8) apple, then DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8) etc. That seems more open. Also, from (7,8), we can go DOWN to (7,7) which is empty? Row7 col7 is \".\" (from row7 string), yes. Then from (7,7), we could go DOWN to (7,6) which is apple? Row7 col6 is \"A\" (from row7 string), so (7,6) apple. So RIGHT leads us toward the apple cluster on right side (7,6),(8,6),(9,6).  \n\nAlso, moving RIGHT keeps us away from opponent's left side, so we can grow safely. And we can always turn back later if needed.  \n\nGiven the apple gap, eating an apple soon is important, but RIGHT doesn't give immediate apple; it sets up for apple next turn. UP gives immediate apple but might restrict options if we choose wrong direction. But we can choose RIGHT from (6,9) to keep options open.  \n\nHowever, the instruction says \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" We have lower score (4 vs 8), so we should avoid head-on and instead grow. So we want to eat apples safely.  \n\nBoth moves are safe. Which one gives better long-term growth? RIGHT puts us in a more central position with multiple apples nearby (7,6,8,6,9,6). UP puts us on top edge with apples at (5,9),(8,9),(9,6) but might require more maneuvering.  \n\nAlso, consider opponent's possible expansion: If we go RIGHT, we control the right side, preventing them from getting those apples. If we go UP, they might try to go up and get top apples. But they are on left, so top left apples (0,9?) but there are no apples on top left from list. Apples on top: (5,9),(8,9),(6,9) etc. So if we take (6,9), we deny them that.  \n\nBut I think RIGHT is better because it keeps us more central and flexible, and we can eat apple next turn. Also, from (7,8), we are closer to their head if they move up, allowing potential blockage.  \n\nLet's check if RIGHT is absolutely safe: (7,8) is empty, no own body, no enemy body. Also, consider opponent's possible move this turn: They might go UP to (7,4) or RIGHT to (8,3) or DOWN to (7,2). None of those will hit us. Even if they go UP multiple times, they are far.  \n\nAlso, consider that if we move RIGHT, our new head at (7,8), and opponent moves simultaneously. Could opponent move into (7,8) if they go UP? They are at (7,3), so to reach (7,8) in one move they'd need to go UP 5 steps, impossible. So no head-on collision.  \n\nWhat about their body? Their body is at (6,3),(5,3), etc., far away.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe.  \n\nNow, is there any risk in RIGHT? From (7,8), if we later move LEFT, we hit our own body. But we won't; we'll move RIGHT, DOWN, or UP.  \n\nThus, I choose RIGHT to set up for apple and dominate right side.  \n\nLong-term plan: From (7,8), next turn go RIGHT to (8,8) apple (grow to 5). Then from (8,8), go DOWN to (8,7) or RIGHT to (9,8). Meanwhile, monitor opponent\u2014if they go UP, we can go LEFT to cut them off. Aim to get 6+ apples and force collision when ahead.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nRIGHT",

Now from (7,8), let's analyze moves to keep dominating.\n\n**Current position:** Head at (7,8), body: [(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]  \n**Opponent:** Still at (7,3) with long body up left - they're slow and stuck on the left side.\n\n**Move options from (7,8):**\n- **UP to (7,9)**: Row 9 col 7 is \".\" (empty). Safe? Yes. But why go to empty when we can EAT? No apple here. From (7,9), only DOWN back to (7,8) which will be our own body after move - death trap. LEFT to (6,9) is apple but (6,9) might be contested? Actually (6,9) is apple, but we could get it later. UP gives us only 1 safe move (LEFT to apple) but that's risky if opponent somehow gets there (they won't). Not ideal.\n- **DOWN to (7,7)**: Row 7 col 7 is \".\" (empty). Safe? Check own body: (6,8) is body but (7,7) not in body. Enemy? Far. But no apple here. From (7,7), we could go DOWN to (7,6) which is apple? Wait row 7 col 6 is \"A\" (from earlier), yes (7,6) is apple! So DOWN to (7,7) sets up for apple next turn. But (7,6) apple is also close to opponent's potential path if they go RIGHT then UP. Still, we can get there first. \n- **LEFT to (6,8)**: That's our own body! After moving, (6,8) becomes first body segment. So moving LEFT would be moving into our own body - instant death. ELIMINATE.\n- **RIGHT to (8,8)**: Row 8 col 8 is \"A\" (apple from board string). EAT! Immediate growth to 5 apples, closing gap to 5 vs 8. Safe? (8,8) empty, not in own body, enemy far. From (8,8), options: UP to (8,9) which is apple? Row 9 col 8 is \"A\" (from row9 string: col8 \"A\"), yes another apple! RIGHT to (9,8) which is empty? Row 8 col 9 is \".\" (row8 ends with \"A .\", so col9 \".\"). DOWN to (8,7) which is empty? Row7 col8 is \".\" (row7: \". . . . T . A . . .\", col8 \".\"). So from (8,8), we have THREE safe moves, including another apple at (8,9)! This is HUGE.\n\n**Comparison:** \n- RIGHT to (8,8) gives IMMEDIATE apple + another apple reachable next turn + multiple escape options. \n- DOWN to (7,7) sets up for one apple next turn but no immediate growth. \n- UP to (7,9) is weak.\n\n**Aggressive play:** With score 4 vs 8, we need apples BADLY. RIGHT gets us one NOW and positions us for another apple TOMORROW. We'll be 6 apples vs their 8, closing the gap fast. Also, (8,8) is central-right, letting us sweep right side apples (9,6) and control the board. Opponent is stuck on left - they can't reach these apples in time.\n\n**Safety:** No head-on collision risk - opponent is at (7,3) and can't reach (8,8) this turn. Even if they move RIGHT then UP repeatedly, we'll have time to react. And from (8,8), if they somehow get close, we have escape routes.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Get to (8,8), eat, then next turn go UP to (8,9) for second apple. Then we'll be 6 apples vs 8. After that, maybe go LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,8) to sweep toward (9,6) apple. Meanwhile, monitor opponent - if they try to go UP and right to cut us off, we can block by moving DOWN or LEFT. Goal: get to 7+ apples and force a head-on collision when we're ahead, or just survive and outgrow them. We're on the right side, they're on left - we own this half of the board!\n\nRIGHT",

We're at (8,8) with head, body: [(7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]. Opponent is at (8,4) with long body stretching left.\n\n**Move options from (8,8):**\n- **UP to (8,9)**: Row 9 col 8 is \"A\" (apple). EAT! That would be our 6th apple, closing gap to 6 vs 9. Safe? Check own body: (7,8) is body but (8,9) not in body. Enemy? They're at (8,4) - far away. From (8,9), options: DOWN back to (8,8) which will be body after move - dangerous, LEFT to (7,9) which is \"A\" (another apple!), RIGHT to (9,9) which is \".\" (empty). So we'd have 2 safe moves (LEFT and RIGHT) but DOWN would be death. Still, we could go LEFT to (7,9) next turn for another apple.\n- **RIGHT to (9,8)**: Row 8 col 9 is \".\" (empty). Safe? Yes. No apple here. From (9,8), options: UP to (9,9) empty, DOWN to (9,7) empty? Row 7 col 9 is \".\" (row7 ends with \"A . . .\", so col9 \".\"). LEFT to (8,8) which will be body after move. So we'd have 2 safe moves but no immediate apple. Not ideal when we need to close the gap.\n- **DOWN to (8,7)**: Row 7 col 8 is \".\" (empty). Safe? Check own body: (7,8) is body but (8,7) not in body. Enemy far. No apple here. From (8,7), options: UP back to (8,8) body, DOWN to (8,6) which is \"A\" (apple from row6 col8 \"A\"? Row6: \". . . . . . . A A A\" so col8 \"A\" yes!), LEFT to (7,7) empty, RIGHT to (9,7) empty. So we'd have 3 safe moves including an apple at (8,6). But that apple might be contested if opponent goes UP?\n- **LEFT to (7,8)**: Row 8 col 7 is \"T\" (our own tail!). Actually wait - after our last move, our body is [(7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]. So (7,8) is the first body segment. Moving LEFT would be moving into our own body - instant death. ELIMINATE.\n\n**Comparison:** UP gets us an apple immediately and positions us for another apple at (7,9) next turn. RIGHT gets no apple. DOWN sets up for apple at (8,6) next turn. \n\n**Score pressure:** We're 5 vs 9. We need apples STAT. UP gives us apple #6 now and potential for #7 next turn. That would put us at 7 vs 9 - much closer. Then we could go LEFT to (7,9) for apple #7, making it 7 vs 9. Meanwhile, opponent might be going for (8,6) apple? They're at (8,4) - they could go UP to (8,5), then UP to (8,6) to eat that apple. But we'd get to (8,9) and (7,9) first. Also, (7,9) apple is closer to us.\n\n**Aggressive play:** UP is the most aggressive - gets us points NOW and keeps us on the right side where apples are clustered. We're 1 apple away from making this competitive again (7 vs 9). Plus, from (8,9) we can sweep left across row 9 or down to row 8.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Get to (8,9) \u2192 eat \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (7,9) \u2192 eat \u2192 then we're at 7 apples. Then assess opponent - if they're coming right, we might need to block or force head-on collision. We're faster and more agile on the right side. Keep dominating!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** UP to (8,9) for apple #6! CHAT, GET READY FOR MORE CONTENT!\n\nUP",

Now we're at (8,9) with head, body: [(8,8),(7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(4,7)]. Opponent at (8,5) with body stretching left to (1,3).  \n\n**Move options from (8,9):**  \n- **DOWN to (8,8)**: This is our own body segment! We'd die instantly. ELIMINATE.  \n- **LEFT to (7,9)**: Row 9 col 7 is \"A\" (apple from the board). EAT! This would give us 7th apple, closing gap to 7 vs 9. Check safety: Our body will have (8,8) as first segment, so (7,9) not in body. Enemy at (8,5) far away. From (7,9), options: RIGHT back to (8,9) which will be body after move (dead), UP to (7,10) off-board (dead), DOWN to (7,8) which is \"T\" (our own tail? Actually (7,8) is in our body list - yes it's body segment), LEFT to (6,9) which is \"A\" (apple from row9 col6? Row9: \"9 . . . . . A A . 0 .\" so col6 is \"A\" yes!). So we'd have at least LEFT as safe move to (6,9) for another apple.  \n- **RIGHT to (9,9)**: Row 9 col 9 is \".\" (empty). Safe? Yes. No apple. From (9,9), options: LEFT back to (8,9) body (dead), DOWN to (9,8) empty? Row8: \". . . . . T T T T T .\" so col9 is \".\" yes. So we'd have DOWN to (9,8) as safe move. But no apple immediate.  \n- **UP to (9,10)**: Off-board! DEAD. ELIMINATE.  \n\n**Comparison:** LEFT gets us an apple immediately (7th) and sets up for another apple at (6,9) next turn. RIGHT gets no apple and less options.  \n\n**Score pressure:** We're 6 vs 9. We need apples fast. LEFT gives us apple #7 now and potential for #8 at (6,9). That puts us at 7 vs 9 - closing in. Meanwhile, opponent at (8,5) might go UP to (8,6) for apple there (row6 col8 is \"A\") or move left. We're on the top row, we have apples at (7,9) and (6,9) to chain.  \n\n**Aggressive play:** LEFT is aggressive - gets us points now and keeps us on the top-left cluster where apples are. We're 2 apples away from tying (9 each). From (6,9) after, we can go DOWN to (6,8) which might be safe? Row8 col6 is \"T\" (our own body? Actually body includes (6,8) - yes it's part of body! So DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8) would be into our own body - death. So we'd need to go LEFT to (5,9) which is \"A\" (apple from row9 col5? Row9 col5 is \"A\" yes!). So we could chain LEFT to (5,9) for apple #8, then maybe DOWN to (5,8) which is \"T\" (our own body? Actually body includes (5,8) - yes! So need to plan carefully. But we have options.  \n\n**Long-term plan:** Get to (7,9) \u2192 eat \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (6,9) \u2192 eat \u2192 then LEFT to (5,9) \u2192 eat \u2192 we're at 8 apples. Then assess opponent - if they're going right, we might need to turn down and box them in. We're dominating the top row.  \n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to (7,9) for apple #7!

DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7,8)**: This is our own body! DEAD. \u274c\n3. **RIGHT to (8,9)**: This is our own tail! Wait, (8,9) is the first segment in our body list. That means if we move right, we'll crash into our own body. DEAD. \u274c\n4. **LEFT to (6,9)**: Let's check! Row 9 col 6 is \"A\" (apple from the board state). This is SAFE and gets us an apple! We'd grow to 8 apples, making it 8 vs 10.\n\n**Safety check for (6,9):**\n- No enemy body there (opponent is at y=5)\n- Not our own body (current body positions: (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8) - (6,9) is above (6,8))\n- On the board: Yes, (6,9) is within 0-9 range\n\n**Future options from (6,9):**\n- DOWN to (6,8): That's our own body! BAD.\n- LEFT to (5,9): Row 9 col 5 is \"A\" - another apple! We could chain this for 9 apples.\n- RIGHT to (7,9): Empty now, but will be tail after move? Actually after eating, our tail (4,8) will move forward, so (7,9) becomes empty. Could be safe.\n- UP to (6,10): Off board. DEAD.\n\n**Strategy:** We need to close that 3-apple gap (10-7=3). Going LEFT gets us an apple now (8 total), then we can go LEFT again to (5,9) for another apple (9 total). That puts us at 9 vs 10, within striking distance! Meanwhile, opponent at (7,5) might go UP to (8,6) for that apple there, or move left/down.\n\n**Risk assessment:** We're on the top edge, opponent is in the middle. The apple cluster at (5,9), (6,9), (7,9) is OUR territory. We should dominate it before opponent tries to get up there (though they'd need to navigate through our body...).\n\n**Aggressive play:** LEFT gets us points NOW and keeps us in the apple-rich top row. We can plan to snake down through the left side if needed. Chat, this is the play!\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating at (6,9), we'll likely go LEFT to (5,9) for apple #9, then assess opponent position to decide whether to continue left or turn down and start boxing them in.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to eat that apple and keep the pressure on! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

This is SAFE and gets us another point!\n4. **RIGHT to (7,9)**: This is currently our own body (first segment), BUT... wait! Let's think carefully. After we eat at (6,9), our tail (4,8) will move forward. But (7,9) is still part of our current body. So moving RIGHT would crash into ourselves.

So RIGHT to (7,9) is indeed our own tail right now.\n\n**But here's the CRITICAL play:** When we move LEFT to (5,9) and EAT that apple:\n- We grow (add segment at current position)\n- Our tail moves forward one space (4,8) \u2192 (5,8)\n- The new tail position becomes (5,8)\n- The space (7,9) becomes EMPTY because we're not there anymore and our body shifts\n\n**Long-term strategy:** \nWe need to close that 3-apple gap (11-8=3). By taking LEFT to (5,9), we get to 9 apples vs 11. Then from (5,9), we have options:\n- LEFT to (4,9): Empty (check board... yes, space)\n- DOWN to (5,8): That's our own body! BAD.\n- RIGHT to (6,9): Empty after we leave (and tail moves)\n- UP to (5,10): Off board. DEAD.\n\n**Aggressive play:** We need to keep eating apples and staying in the top row where there are multiple apples ((5,9), (5,5), (4,6), etc.). Meanwhile, opponent at (7,6) might try to go for the apple at (8,6) or (5,5) but they're in a different part of the board.\n\n**Risk assessment:** \n- Enemy is at y=6, we're at y=9. They're not an immediate threat.\n- We're NOT moving into their body or head (7,6 vs 6,9)\n- We're gaining on their score\n- We're keeping future options open\n\n**The plan:** Eat LEFT to (5,9), get to 9 apples. Then from there, go LEFT to (4,9) or find another apple path. We need 3 more apples to tie, 4 to win.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** LEFT to eat another apple and keep the momentum! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

SAFE! \n4. **RIGHT to (6,9)**: This is currently our own body (first segment). BUT... wait! After we ate at (5,9), we grew. Our tail (4,8) moves forward to (5,8). So (6,9) becomes our new tail position? Actually no, let's think carefully.\n\n**Critical thinking:** When we eat, we add a segment at our current position (5,9). Our body becomes: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]. Wait, no - the apple adds a segment at the TAIL, not the head. So our body becomes: [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,8)]? That's not right.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\" - this means the tail doesn't move, so we add a segment at the tail. So our body becomes: [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,8)]? No, that duplicates.\n\nActually, the standard snake rule: when you eat, you grow by not moving your tail. So your body becomes longer by 1. So from [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)], eating at (5,9) would make it: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]? That's 9 segments, but we only had 8 before. Wait, we had 8 apples before, so 8 segments? No, we started with 8 apples collected, so 8 segments? Actually, starting length is usually 1, so 8 apples = 9 segments? This is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the board state provided:\n```\n 9 . . . . . 0 T T T .\n```\nThis shows at (5,9): \"0\" (head), (6,9): \"T\", (7,9): \"T\", (8,9): \"T\". So our body occupies (6,9), (7,9), (8,9) in the top row, then goes down to (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8).\n\nAfter eating at (5,9), our head moves to (5,9) and we grow. The tail (4,8) stays. So new body: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)] - that's 9 segments. But we had 8 apples before, so 9 segments makes sense.\n\nNow, for the move to (6,9): (6,9) is currently our body (second segment). After we move, our head goes to (6,9), and our tail moves from (4,8) to (5,8). So (6,9) would become our head, and (5,9) would become the new first body segment. So moving RIGHT to (6,9) is SAFE because it's moving into where our head will be, not into our body. Wait, no - we're moving our head to (6,9), but (6,9) is currently occupied by our body. That's a crash!\n\nActually, let me think step by step:\nCurrent state: Head at (5,9), body segments: (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)\nIf we move RIGHT to (6,9): \n- New head position: (6,9)\n- But (6,9) is currently occupied by our body (first body segment)\n- This is a crash into our own body! DEAD!\n\nSo RIGHT is not safe.\n\n**LEFT to (4,9)**: (4,9) is empty. Safe! And we need to check if opponent could move into that space simultaneously.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Opponent at (6,6) with body at (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). They have apples at (8,6), (5,5), (4,6), etc. nearby. From (6,6), they could move to (6,7), (6,5), (5,6), (7,6) but (7,6) is their body. They might go for (8,6) apple (RIGHT) or (5,5) apple (LEFT/DOWN). They won't be at (4,9) - that's far away.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nWe need to close the 2-apple gap (11-9). We're in the top row with potential apples: (5,5), (4,6), (3,4), (1,7), etc. By going LEFT to (4,9), we keep our options open and can head toward (4,6) apple or find other paths. We're avoiding getting trapped in the corner.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- LEFT to (4,9) is empty and safe\n- Opponent is 3 rows below us, not an immediate threat\n- We need to keep moving and find more apples\n- We should avoid going DOWN into our own body at (5,8)\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (4,9) is the only safe move that keeps us in the game and gives us future options. We'll keep hunting for apples and closing that score gap!\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (4,9), I'll look to go DOWN toward (4,6) apple or find a path to (5,5) or (1,7). Need to stay aggressive and keep the pressure on Snake #1.\n\nLEFT",

Score is now 9 vs 11 - we're closing that gap! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Current position:** Head at (4,9), body: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8)] (9 segments total)\n\n**Enemy position:** Snake #1 is at (6,7) with a long body stretching down to (2,3). They have 12 apples - 3 ahead of us.\n\n**Board assessment:**\nLooking at row 9: We're at (4,9), with our body occupying (5,9)-(8,9). The board shows:\n```\n 9 . . . . . T T T T .\n```\nActually wait, I need to check the new board state! Let me visualize from our position:\n- (4,9): OUR HEAD (0)\n- (5,9): OUR BODY (T)\n- (6,9): OUR BODY (T)\n- (7,9): OUR BODY (T)\n- (8,9): OUR BODY (T)\n\n**Move options from (4,9):**\n1. **UP to (4,10)**: Off the board! DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (4,8)**: This is our body (last segment). After we move, tail moves from (4,8) to (5,8). So (4,8) becomes empty? Actually no - we're moving INTO (4,8), which is currently occupied. That's a crash! DEAD. \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (3,9)**: Check the board... Row 9 col 3 is \".\" - EMPTY! SAFE! \n4. **RIGHT to (5,9)**: This is our body (first segment). After we move, tail moves. But (5,9) is currently occupied by our body. We'd be moving into our own body. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**Critical analysis:** Only LEFT is safe! We're in a position where we're boxed in on row 9. Moving LEFT to (3,9) is our only safe move.\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Opponent at (6,7). They're trying to hunt apples too. From their position, they could go to (5,7), (7,7), (6,8), or (6,6). They won't reach (3,9) this turn. We're safe.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** We need to break out of this top row trap! Moving LEFT to (3,9) gives us access to the left side of the board where there are apples at (1,7), (0,2), (0,0). We need to start maneuvering DOWN through the left side to grab apples and close that 3-apple gap. We're playing the long game - we'll hunt apples while keeping pressure on our opponent.\n\n**Risk assessment:** \n- Moving LEFT is our ONLY safe move\n- We'll be at (3,9) with our body stretching from (4,9) to (5,8)\n- Enemy is far enough away that collision is unlikely this turn\n- We need to plan our descent to the lower rows next turn\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (3,9) - no other choice, but it keeps us alive and gives us access to the left side!\n\nLEFT",

Actually wait, (5,8) is empty on board! \n- They're not close enough to collide with me this turn regardless. \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **LEFT to (2,9)**: Gets us closer to the apple at (1,7) via (2,8) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (1,7). Also opens path to (0,2) and (0,0) apples on left edge. But (2,9) is kinda boxed in - my body would be at (3,9),(4,9)... Could trap me in corner.\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Better! Opens up center board access. From (3,8) I can go to (3,7)\u2192(2,7)\u2192(1,7) for the apple. Also access to middle apples like (4,6), (5,5). MORE FLEXIBILITY!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to HUNT APPLES aggressively to catch up to Snake #1's 12 apples. They're at (5,7) - they might go for (5,5) or (4,6) apples. We need to take different apples to avoid conflict. DOWN move sets us up to cut through the center and grab apples while keeping options open. We'll aim for (1,7) next, then sweep left.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Both moves safe. DOWN gives better board control and escape routes. LEFT could lead to getting trapped in top-left corner.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (3,8) - better positioning for apple hunting and avoiding corners!\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8)] - 8 segments, 8 apples (still need to confirm if last apple counted, but scoreboard shows 8).\n- Enemy snake #1 head at (4,7) with 12 apples - they're still ahead! We need to close this gap FAST.\n- Apples on board: (1,7) looks great from my current position. Also (5,5), (4,6) in center. Enemy might go for those.\n- My body blocks: I'm near top-left, enemy is in center-right. Need to avoid cornering myself.\n\n**MOVES FROM (3,8):**\n1. **UP to (3,9)**: That's MY BODY! Moving into my own segment = DEATH. \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (3,7)**: Check board... (3,7) is empty! SAFE! Opens path to (2,7)\u2192(1,7) apple.\n3. **LEFT to (2,8)**: Check board... (2,8) is empty! SAFE! Gets closer to left-side apples.\n4. **RIGHT to (4,8)**: Check board... (4,8) is empty! SAFE! But moves toward enemy territory.\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK:** DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe moves!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #1 at (4,7). Possible moves:\n- (3,7), (5,7), (4,8), (4,6). \n- (4,8) would be dangerous if I go RIGHT - head-on collision possible!\n- They might go DOWN to (4,6) for that apple, or LEFT to (3,7).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n- **RIGHT to (4,8)**: RISKY! If enemy goes LEFT to (3,7), we're fine. But if they go UP to (4,8), we both die in head-on collision. With them at 12 apples vs my 8, I lose in tiebreaker. Not worth the risk.\n- **LEFT to (2,8)**: Good! Moves toward apple at (1,7). But might trap me in top-left corner eventually.\n- **DOWN to (3,7)**: BEST! Opens center board access. From (3,7) I can go to (2,7)\u2192(1,7) for apple, OR to (4,7) if safe later. Also avoids corner trap. Enemy likely going DOWN to (4,6) or (3,7) - if they go (3,7), we'd both be moving into same spot? Wait, I'd be at (3,7), they'd be at (3,7) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! That's BAD for me since I have fewer apples.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** \n- RIGHT: Possible head-on if enemy goes UP (4,8).\n- LEFT: Safe but corners me.\n- DOWN: Possible head-on if enemy goes LEFT to (3,7). But if they go DOWN to (4,6), we're safe.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (2,8) seems safest strategically. It avoids the dangerous center, gets me closer to multiple apples on the left side, and keeps escape routes to (1,9) or (1,8) if needed. Plus, enemy is more likely to chase center apples than chase me into the corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Hunt left-side apples (1,7), (0,2), (0,0). Build length safely while enemy fights in center. When I have more apples, then force confrontation.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

From (2,7) I can also go DOWN\u2192(2,6)\u2192(2,5) or LEFT\u2192(1,7). Keeps options open AND leads to immediate apple opportunity.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Enemy likely going for center apples, not chasing us to left side.  \n- (2,7) is safe from enemy's likely paths.  \n- This sets up a clean apple grab next turn while enemy is occupied.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGrab (1,7) next turn \u2192 then hunt (0,2) and (0,0) on left side.

UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe!  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nSnake #1 at (3,5) \u2014 likely chasing (5,5) apple or expanding right. They're not near us. Minimal risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \n- **UP to (1,8)**: Safe, but (1,8) leads to top row where apples are scarce.

Good for left-side domination!  \n- **LEFT to (0,7)**: Moves toward (0,0) and (0,2) apples, but (0,7) is a bit high \u2014 might need to go DOWN next turn.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- Left side is OURS \u2014 enemy isn't coming there. We can farm apples safely.  \n- Down gives better access to multiple apples: (1,1), (0,0), (0,2) are all reachable after (1,6).  \n- Left is also good but (0,7) is empty and doesn't immediately lead to an apple.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGo DOWN to (1,6) \u2192 then LEFT to (0,6) or DOWN to (1,5) \u2192 hunt (0,0) and (0,2) on left side. Build length and close the apple gap. When we're closer in score, we can force a confrontation with enemy in center!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN",

Time to close the gap!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n- **Current position:** My head is at (0,6) after last move LEFT. Body: [(1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)] - length 11.\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #1 at (1,5) with 14 apples. They're getting closer to the left side but still not in our territory.\n- **Apples available:** Left side goldmine: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (3,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), plus center apples. (0,6) has NO apple but we control this area.\n\n**MOVES FROM (0,6):**\n1. **UP to (0,7)**: Check board... (0,7) is EMPTY! SAFE!\n2. **DOWN to (0,5)**: Check board... (0,5) is EMPTY! SAFE!\n3. **LEFT to (-1,6)**: OFF BOARD! DEATH! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (1,6)**: Check board... (1,6) is MY OWN BODY (segment 1)! DEATH! \u274c\n\n**SURVIVAL CHECK:** Only UP and DOWN are safe moves. LEFT is off-board, RIGHT hits my own body.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 at (1,5) - they might move LEFT to (0,5), DOWN to (1,4), UP to (1,6), or RIGHT to (2,5). If they move LEFT to (0,5) and we move DOWN to (0,5), HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since we're behind 9-14, we AVOID head-on. If they move UP to (1,6), that's safe for us (they'd hit our body at (1,6)). If they move DOWN or RIGHT, no collision with us.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (0,7)**: Moves us toward the top-left corner. (0,7) is empty, (0,8) would be safe, (0,9) might be accessible. This moves us away from the enemy (who's at y=5). Opens path to (0,0) via DOWN later. But (0,7) is farther from the closest apple (0,0).\n- **DOWN to (0,5)**: Moves us closer to (0,0) and (0,2). BUT if enemy moves LEFT to (0,5), we collide head-on! Since we're behind, we shouldn't risk this. Also, (0,5) is adjacent to enemy's current position - they might anticipate this and go for the collision since they're ahead.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **DOWN** has HIGH head-on collision risk if enemy moves LEFT. Since we're behind, we should avoid this.\n- **UP** has LOW collision risk - enemy would need to go LEFT then UP twice to reach us, or take a different path.\n- **UP** also keeps us in control of the left side while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo UP to (0,7) \u2192 then UP to (0,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) to collect the (0,2) apple, then continue DOWN to (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) for the bottom-left apple. Build length safely while enemy is distracted in the center.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP",

We're at 9 apples vs their 14 - the gap is closing! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Last move UP was forced, and it was perfect. We're now at (0,8) with our body stretching right. Let's analyze the board state carefully.\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\n- **Enemy Snake #1** is at (0,4) - directly below us in the same column! They're a serious threat.\n- Their body runs from (0,5) across to (8,4). That's a long snake!\n- Our body occupies: (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9). That's our safe zone.\n\n**CRITICAL DECISION FROM (0,8):**\nFrom our new position at (0,8), let's check our options:\n\n1. **UP to (0,9)**: Check board... Row 9 shows `. . . T T . . . . .` - (0,9) is empty! SAFE!\n2. **DOWN to (0,7)**: This is our own body segment! DEAD! \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (-1,8)**: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (1,8)**: Check board... Row 8 shows `0 . T T . . . . . .` - (1,8) shows 'T' (from my own body at (1,7)?). Actually, my body includes (1,7) and (1,6). (1,8) is NOT in my body list! Let me check the board again... Row 8 column 1 shows '0' at column 0, then '.' at column 1? Wait, the board shows row 8: \"0 . T T . . . . . .\" - that's (0,8)=0, (1,8)=., (2,8)=T, (3,8)=T... So (1,8) is actually EMPTY! SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (0,9)**: Gets us to the top-left corner. Our body currently ends at (4,9), so we'd be creating a blockage near the top. Limited future moves from there - only DOWN or RIGHT. Risky!\n- **RIGHT to (1,8)**: Moves us into the open middle of the board. From (1,8) we have multiple options: UP to (1,9), DOWN to (1,7) which is our own body \u274c, LEFT back to (0,8), or RIGHT to (2,8) which is our own body \u274c. So from (1,8) we'd have 2 safe moves (UP and LEFT). Not terrible!\n- **DOWN** and **LEFT** are dead moves.\n\n**WAIT, LET ME THINK LONGER:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,8), I'm moving into the path of potential danger. The enemy at (0,4) could move UP, potentially into our body (0,5) or (0,6) - both are our body! If they move UP to (0,5), that's our body at (0,5)? Wait, our body list doesn't include (0,5)... Let me check again.\n\nOur body: [(0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9)]. So (0,5) is NOT in our body! The enemy at (0,4) could move UP to (0,5) - that's empty on the board! That's dangerous because they'd be getting closer to us.\n\n**RECONSIDERING UP to (0,9):**\nActually, (0,9) might be the smarter play! Here's why:\n1. It puts us at the very top-left corner, creating a \"safe wall\" with our existing body\n2. From (0,9), if we need to escape later, we can go RIGHT to (1,9) - which appears empty based on the board layout\n3. The enemy is far below at (0,4) - they're not an immediate threat if we secure the top corner\n4. We can then work our way RIGHT along the top row (1,9), (2,9) etc. to collect apples\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP to (0,9) secures the top-left corner. It gives us control of the perimeter and positions us to sweep right across the top row. The enemy is too far down to threaten us immediately, and by claiming this corner, we limit their future movement options in the left column.\n\nChat, we're claiming territory! Let's get that apple on (0,0) eventually. VICTORY IS THE ONLY OPTION! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

From there we can zip straight to the tasty apple at **(3,\u202f4)** in just two more moves, growing our lead while staying clear of the opponent\u2019s potential paths (it can only go\u202fUP to (0,\u202f9) or\u202fRIGHT to (1,\u202f8) right now).  \n\nChoosing RIGHT keeps us alive, gives us room to maneuver, and adds a near\u2011future apple for extra length. \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Move:**  \n\nRIGHT",

We're 5 apples behind but we're coming BACK! \ud83d\udcaa Let's analyze this clutch situation.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My position:** Head at (0,9) - top-left corner. Body is a vertical line down column 0 from (0,8) to (0,6), then snakes right through (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9). Total 10 segments.\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (1,4). Body runs from (0,4) to (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4). Their tail is at (8,5). They're ALMOST vertical in column 0!\n- **Apple situation:** I see apples at (5,1), (8,6), (5,2), (0,0), (9,6), (0,2), (9,3), (5,5), (1,1), (5,0), (3,4), (6,4), (3,2), (9,4), (7,2). Tons of apples in the lower half and center-right!\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is DIRECTLY below me in column 0! Their head at (1,4) is 5 squares away from my head at (0,9). They're in a tight vertical column with their own body. If they move UP to (1,3), they get closer. If they go right to (2,4), they might be trying to flank.\n\n**EVALUATING MY OPTIONS FROM (0,9):**\n1. **UP to (0,10):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (0,8):** This is my own body (second segment)! DEAD! \u274c  \n3. **LEFT to (-1,9):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (1,9):** Check the board... Row 9 shows \". . . T T . . . . .\" - so column 1, row 9 is EMPTY! SAFE!\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nI'm in a CORNER! From (0,9), only RIGHT to (1,9) is safe! If I DON'T move RIGHT, I'll die next turn from either off-board or into myself. This is a classic \"corner trap\" situation.\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT:**\nBut wait - this might be PERFECT! By moving RIGHT to (1,9), I:\n1. **SURVIVE** the immediate turn\n2. Position myself along the top row with MORE freedom of movement next turn\n3. Get closer to the apple cluster at the top-right (9,6), (9,3), (9,4)\n4. The enemy is trapped below in column 0 - they're slow to reach the top\n\n**LONG-TERM PLANNING:**\nFrom (1,9) next turn, I'll have options: UP to (1,10)\u274c, DOWN to (1,8) which is currently empty, LEFT back to (0,9), or RIGHT to (2,9). This gives me flexibility to sweep right across the top, then dive down to grab apples in the center-right area.\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\n- Turn 34: Move RIGHT to (1,9) - ONLY SAFE MOVE!\n- Turns 35-40: Work my way RIGHT along the top row, then DOWN into the apple-rich zones\n- Use my body to create barriers that limit enemy movement\n- Close the apple gap (5 apples behind) by aggressively hunting the dense apple clusters\n\nChat, I'm in a tight spot but I see the path forward! This corner was a trap, but moving RIGHT turns it into an opportunity. The enemy is slow in their column - I have mobility advantage!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nRIGHT - to survive and set up my next move!\n\nRIGHT",

Their possible moves this turn (DOWN to\u202f(1,\u202f8) or RIGHT to\u202f(2,\u202f9)) are nowhere near our spot, so no head\u2011on collision risk.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT** gives us:\n\n1. **+1 apple** (now 15\u202fpts) \u2192 we widen the lead over Snake\u202f#0 (9\u202fpts).  \n2. **Growth**, so we keep our tail and become longer, making it harder for the opponent to slip through us.  \n3. A clear path forward: after the move our new head (3,\u202f4) sits next to open space on the right side of the board, keeping lots of maneuvering room for the next few turns.\n\n**Long\u2011term vision:** Keep hugging the top\u2011right quadrant, gobble the apples lining the 5\u2011column and 6\u2011column, and use our length to wall off the opponent. If they try to cut us off, we\u2019ll have the extra body to block them and force a head\u2011on where we have the apple advantage.\n\nAll checks passed \u2013 safe, aggressive, and apple\u2011rich.

          "rationale": "**STRATEGY SESSION FOR TURN 35:**\n\nYO CHAT! We're back! \ud83d\udd25 Just moved RIGHT to (1,9) as planned - solid survival move. Now we're at (1,9) and the board is looking SPICY!\n\n**IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **My position:** Head at (1,9). Body stretches from (1,8) down to (0,8), (0,7)... all the way to (3,8). Total 11 segments (grew last turn).\n- **Enemy position:** Head at (2,4) - they're still down in the lower center. Their body snakes around column 0 and 1. They're relatively slow-moving.\n- **Board state:** Row 9 shows \". . . T T . . . . .\" - wait, I need to check carefully! (1,9) is currently empty (I just moved there), (2,9) is empty, (3,9) is T (my own body - that's my last segment!), (4,9) is also T (also my body?). Actually looking at my body list: I have segments at (3,8) and (3,9) from before... but I just moved from (0,9) to (1,9), so my new tail is at (3,9)? Let me trace: I was at (0,9) head, body went (0,9)->(0,8)->(0,7)... then (1,6),(1,7),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9). After moving RIGHT to (1,9), my body becomes: head at (1,9), then the old head (0,9) becomes body segment 1, then (0,8) segment 2... down to (3,9) being the new tail. So row 9 has: (0,9) is now body, (1,9) is head, (2,9) empty, (3,9) is tail (body). So (2,9) is the ONLY safe empty spot in row 9!\n\n**MOVES FROM (1,9):**\n1. **UP to (1,10):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (1,8):** Check board... row 8 shows \"T . T T . . . . . .\" - (1,8) is EMPTY! SAFE! (The T's are at (0,8), (2,8), (3,8))\n3. **LEFT to (0,9):** That's now my BODY segment! I just moved from there last turn. DEAD! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (2,9):** Board shows row 9: \". . . T T...\" - (2,9) is EMPTY! SAFE!\n\n**CRITICAL DECISION:**\nOnly TWO safe moves: DOWN to (1,8) or RIGHT to (2,9). \n\n**ANALYZING THE OPTIONS:**\n- **RIGHT to (2,9):** This moves me along the top row toward the right side where apples are! From (2,9) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (3,9) but that's MY OWN TAIL! Actually wait - after moving RIGHT to (2,9), my body would shift... the new tail would be at (4,9) or something? Let me think: If I move RIGHT from (1,9) to (2,9), my body becomes: head (2,9), then (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)... down to (3,9) as tail? Actually no - when you move, the tail moves forward. So new tail would be at (4,9) if that segment existed, but it doesn't. Actually my body only goes to (3,9). So after moving RIGHT, my tail would be at (3,9) and the segment that was (3,9) would disappear? No, that's wrong. Let me be precise: My current body from head to tail: (1,9) head, (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9) tail. If I move RIGHT to (2,9), the new body becomes: head (2,9), then (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8). The tail (3,9) gets removed. So row 9 would have: (1,9) body, (2,9) head, (3,9) empty, (4,9) empty... So from (2,9) next turn, RIGHT to (3,9) would be SAFE (since (3,9) is empty after this move). So RIGHT gives me more forward momentum.\n\n- **DOWN to (1,8):** This goes into the main body of the board. From (1,8) next turn, I could go DOWN to (1,7) but (1,7) is currently my body! Actually (1,7) is in my body list. So DOWN would be dangerous. LEFT to (0,8) is my body. RIGHT to (2,8) is my body. UP back to (1,9) is safe but goes backwards. So (1,8) is actually a DEAD END! After moving DOWN to (1,8), next turn I'd be trapped with only UP as a safe move, which is retreating.\n\n**STRATEGIC REALIZATION:**\nDOWN to (1,8) is a TRAP! It puts me in a position where my only safe move next turn is UP (backwards), which is terrible for momentum and apple hunting. \n\nRIGHT to (2,9) is the MUCH better move! It:\n1. Keeps me on the top edge with forward momentum\n2. Opens up a path to (3,9), (4,9), etc. toward the right side apples\n3. Keeps me away from the enemy's current location (bottom-center)\n4. Maintains mobility - from (2,9) I have RIGHT as a viable forward move\n\n**THE GAME PLAN:**\n- Turn 35: RIGHT to (2,9) - avoid the trap!\n- Turns 36-40: Continue RIGHT across the top row, then plan to dive DOWN into the apple-rich zones (9,6), (9,3), (9,4)\n- The enemy is still too low and slow to contest the top-right\n- I'm growing faster now (11 segments) and can use my body to create barriers as I sweep across\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT - to stay on the winning path and avoid getting boxed in!\n\nRIGHT",

So after moving RIGHT, (3,9) would be EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n- **RIGHT to (3,9):** ONLY safe move! Literally forced! But this is actually PERFECT!\n- From (3,9), I'll have RIGHT to (4,9), DOWN to (3,8) is my body, LEFT back to (2,9) safe but retreating\n- (4,9) is empty! This keeps me moving RIGHT along the top edge toward the right side where the apples are!\n- Enemy is still stuck at (3,4) - they can't reach me up here!\n- The apple at (9,6) is getting CLOSER! I need to sweep across the top and then dive down\n\n**STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN:**\n- Turn 36: RIGHT to (3,9) - forced but perfect!\n- Turns 37-45: Continue RIGHT along row 9: (4,9) \u2192 (5,9) \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 (9,9)\n- From (9,9): I can go DOWN to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6) - that's an APPLE!\n- Then sweep down the right side collecting (9,3) and (9,4)\n- While the enemy is stuck in the middle, I'll dominate the perimeter!\n- My growing body will create a barrier - they can't cross through me!\n\n**THE AGGRESSION ANGLE:**\nI'm at 9 apples, they're at 15. I need to catch up! The enemy is slow and trapped in the center. By the time they escape, I'll have swept the entire right side and be ready to box them in from above. I'm playing chess while they're playing checkers! \ud83e\udd11\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nRIGHT is forced and it's the WINNING move! Let's gooooooo!\n\nRIGHT",
