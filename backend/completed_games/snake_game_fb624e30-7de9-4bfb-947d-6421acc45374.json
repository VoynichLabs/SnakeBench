Current safe moves (no immediate death from walls or bodies): UP to (4,9), DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,8), RIGHT to (5,8).\n- OPPONENT (#1): Head at (2,5) with body at (3,5) and (4,5). No immediate collision risk from their next move on my side.\n\nDecision process recap:\n- Step 1: Evaluate all four directions. All four are legal for now (no off-board, no self-collision in one step, no stepping into the opponent\u2019s body this turn).\n- Step 2: Eliminate dangerous options if any. None are immediately fatal this turn.\n- Step 3: Pick the option that preserves flexibility, keeps lines open, and pressures the opponent. The top edge gives me long-term control and keeps multiple escape routes open.\n\nShort-term rationale:\n- Going UP to (4,9) puts me on the top edge, which is great for constraining the play around me and allows me to threaten \u201cbox\u201d patterns with easy left/right options along the border.\n- From (4,9), I still have LEFT/RIGHT options on the top row, and I won\u2019t prematurely trap myself by dipping back into my own neck (there\u2019s no tail yet to worry about, but keep it in mind).\n- The opponent is down at y=5; heading up now buys time to chase nearby apples if needed and still keep the door open to pressure him later.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 5: Move UP to (4,9). If safe, keep the top edge as a pressure corridor.\n- If he starts drifting upward toward my level, swing LEFT along the top to reduce his maneuver room and tilt toward a potential head-on or corner squeeze, while still hunting apples along accessible rows.\n- If the opportunity to trap a corner or create a boxed loop presents itself, prioritize a sequence that closes him into a wall with me on the inside of the loop, but never sacrifice safety for a chase.\n- Maintain awareness of apples on lower rows as optional growth targets to catch up on score, but only pursue them if they don\u2019t risk a fatal squeeze or forced collision.\n\nFinal move plan:\n- UP\n\nUP",

Apples are scattered, but we\u2019re not chasing them outright\u2014we\u2019re chasing space control and a future trap.\n\nSafety check and read on:\n- From (6,8) you can move UP to (6,9), DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), or RIGHT to (7,8). All are currently open; no immediate collisions.\n- The opponent is far left and vertical; direct head-on is unlikely this turn. The best path to a favorable box is to press toward the bottom-right region while keeping multiple escape routes open.\n\nWhy DOWN as the best option:\n- DOWN to (6,7) keeps you centralized and angles you toward the apple at (6,6) for a growth token next turn, edging your score closer to him without risking a quick head-on.\n- It preserves options to slip toward the bottom edge later, which is key for boxing him in without letting him slip past you along the top or right edges.\n- It avoids crowding near the opponent\u2019s current vertical corridor and minimizes the chance of an inadvertent trap by his head or body this turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Secure the apple at (6,6) when safe to grow and extend your reach.\n- Gradually push toward the bottom-right quadrant to shrink his available space, all while keeping at least two safe continuation moves (e.g., if you drop, you can still move left or right in subsequent turns to dodge any sudden shifts).\n- If the opportunity for a calculated head-on collision with him presents itself after you\u2019ve grown and you\u2019re ahead in apples, reassess \u2014 but for now, avoid direct collision since you\u2019re behind on score.\n\nProceeding with the DOWN move now.\n\nDOWN",

Let me lay it out with the heat.\n\n- Current from (6,6): Up is a suicide (lands on your own body at (6,7)).  \n- Safe options this turn: Down -> (6,5), Left -> (5,6), Right -> (7,6).  \n- Down (6,5) is especially juicy: there\u2019s an apple exactly there. If we grab it, we gain +1 apple now and keep the line alive to chase more fruit. Plus, that path keeps us in the middle of the board where we can pivot and threaten a box later.  \n- Left (5,6) is clean and puts us on a diagonal toward the enemy\u2019s left flank; it could set up future pin points but doesn\u2019t immediately grow.  \n- Right (7,6) stays safe and preserves flexible escape routes, but it doesn\u2019t pressure the apple chest or directly threaten the opponent.\n\nWhy this is the move: We\u2019re down on score, so taking the immediate apple helps close the gap and gives us more length to maneuver later without sacrificing safety. The apple at (6,5) is right in reach, and we can chain into (6,4) next turn (another apple) if the board cooperates. We stay mobile and avoid any risk of collision with the opponent this turn.\n\nLong-term vibe: drop down to threaten a vertical squeeze along the 6th/5th columns, use the extra len to force risky crossovers or head-on if he misreads, but only when it\u2019s safe. Keep him in front of us, not behind a wall.\n\nDOWN",

The plan is to create room, avoid getting boxed, and position to threaten favorable trades later rather than forcing a risky head-on now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move into open space, then gradually swing toward the top/right apples cluster (toward (9,7), (9,6), (6,8), etc.) while keeping a buffer from the opponent.\n- Avoid any moves that would pull you into a tight trap or send you into a direct collision.\n\nLong-term note to self:\n- Maintain mobility; don\u2019t let the enemy push you into a corner.

Turn 29, your boy is in position to press up and keep space for a clean dodge.\n\nDecision process:\n- Safe moves from head (5,8): UP to (5,9), LEFT to (4,8), RIGHT to (6,8). DOWN is suicide (neck at 5,7).\n- We stay away from enemy\u2019s immediate path and avoid kiting into a trap. UP gives the most breathing room and keeps our vertical corridor open.\n\nChosen move: UP\n\nReasoning:\n- Up (5,9) opens space and doesn\u2019t crash into any body. It also avoids getting boxed in by our own shape on the current lattice.\n- LEFT (4,8) would nudge us toward our own flank, risking tighter space later. RIGHT (6,8) could pull us into a crowded edge near our own potential footprint; UP gives us the most future options.\n- We\u2019re down on apples (9 vs 13) but avoiding a risky head-on and maintaining mobility beats a reckless trade now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (5,9). From there, gradually shift toward the upper-right cluster of apples while keeping a buffer from the opponent.\n- Keep our top corridor alive; don\u2019t let the enemy trap us in a corner.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Play patient, keep multiple escape paths open, and avoid head-on collisions unless we clearly outnumber the opponent in apples. If the chance to force a trade presents itself with a comfortable safety margin, we\u2019ll consider it; otherwise we\u2019ll keep space and reel in apples when safe.\n\nNext turn plan (for memory cue):\n- If space permits, pivot toward the right-top apple cluster (around (9,7)-(9,6)) while watching the opponent\u2019s approach. Maintain separation and avoid crossing paths head-on unless we have the advantage.\n\nUP",

WE GOT THIS.\n\nDECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) ELIMINATE any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body). Don't throw!\n3) Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that keep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves available and move you CLOSER to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions.\n4) Read the board: opponent is miles away at bottom, so the safest route is to preserve space and work the top row toward the apple cluster.\n\nFrom head (5,9): \n- UP is off the board (dead). \n- DOWN goes into your own neck at (5,8) (dead). \n- RIGHT to (6,9) is safe but doesn\u2019t immediately threaten the enemy and tightens your path near the edge. \n- LEFT to (4,9) is safe and opens a long, clear corridor toward the apple at (2,9) and the left-side apple cluster.\n\nChosen move: LEFT\n\nReasoning:\n- LEFT keeps the top corridor open, gives multiple safe follow-ups (continue left along y=9 toward (2,9) and beyond), and maintains max space to dodge the opponent far away.\n- RIGHT would be a fine tempo-gain but doesn\u2019t pressure current apples as effectively and flirts with edge-traps along the right side.\n- Neither move invites an immediate collision with enemy, since they\u2019re far away in the lower rows.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Slip to (4,9) this turn, then head toward (3,9) and (2,9) to eat the top-row apple at (2,9) on the next opportunity. Keep the head high and the path open.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Build a long, open corridor along the top, work toward the left-side apples (0,8) and (0,6) if safe, and avoid locking yourself into a dead-end. If an opportunity to force a high-risk head-on collision presents with a clear safety margin, we\u2019ll take it to close the apple gap.\n\nNext turn plan (memory cue):\n- After moving to (4,9), prioritize (3,9) and (2,9) to grab the high-value apple, then consider looping toward the left edge while keeping escape routes in view.\n\nLEFT",
