The enemy snake is at (2,2) with no body segments.\n\nAvailable apples are at: (3,9), (8,0), (4,7), (9,6), (5,6)\n\nLet me evaluate each possible move:\n\n- UP: (6,4) \u2192 (6,5) - This is safe, empty space\n- DOWN: (6,4) \u2192 (6,3) - This is safe, empty space  \n- LEFT: (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) - This is safe, empty space\n- RIGHT: (6,4) \u2192 (7,4) - This is safe, empty space\n\nAll four moves are safe since I have no body yet and none would put me off the board or into another snake.\n\nNow considering apple proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (5,6) - 2 moves away (UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP)\n- Next closest is (4,7) - 3 moves away\n- (9,6) is 3 moves away\n- (3,9) is 5+ moves away\n- (8,0) is 6+ moves away\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at (2,2), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nFor future mobility, moving toward the center (around (4,5)-(6,5)) would give me more options than moving toward edges.\n\nShort-term plan: Head toward the apple cluster around (4,7)-(5,6)-(9,6) while staying in open areas to maintain mobility options. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nRIGHT moves me away from the closest apples. UP or LEFT bring me closer to the apple cluster. LEFT puts me at (5,4) which is closer to both (5,6) and (4,7), while UP puts me at (6,5) which is also good positioning.\n\nLEFT seems optimal as it moves me directly toward the closest apples while keeping me centered with good future mobility options.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 1) \u2013 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2013 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 2) \u2013 empty, inside board. Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe right now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and apples:**  \n\nEnemy at (6, 4) is far away, so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\nClosest apple to me is (4, 7) at distance |4-2| + |7-2| = 2 + 5 = 7.  \n(5, 6) is |5-2| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7 as well.  \n(3, 9) is 1 + 7 = 8.  \n\nSo (4, 7) and (5, 6) are equally distant in Manhattan distance, but (5, 6) is closer in x-direction from me.  \n\nFrom (2, 2):  \n- UP gets me to (2, 3) \u2013 slightly closer to (4, 7) and (5, 6) in y-direction.  \n- RIGHT gets me to (3, 2) \u2013 slightly closer in x-direction to those apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options:**  \n\nAt (2, 3): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2013 all likely open unless enemy moves into them.  \nAt (3, 2): same.  \n\nBut moving UP increases y, which is good because apples are mostly in upper half of board.  \n\nAlso, moving RIGHT puts me at x=3, which is closer to the column of apple (4, 7) and (5, 6).  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nFrom (2, 2) to (4, 7): need +2 x, +5 y.  \nFrom (2, 2) to (5, 6): need +3 x, +4 y.  \n\nSo moving RIGHT helps with x difference for both. Moving UP helps with y difference.  \n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:  \n1. It moves toward the cluster of apples at x=4,5.  \n2. It keeps me in middle x-range for flexibility.  \n3. From (3, 2), I can go UP next toward apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid future dead ends:**  \n\nAt length 1, I have no body to trap myself yet, so any move is fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (5, 6) or (4, 7) while staying central. Avoid moving toward enemy unless necessary. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path \u2014 they might go for (5, 6) too, but they\u2019re farther.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are mostly in upper half, so gaining y early is useful.  \n2. From (3, 3), I have all four directions open next turn.  \n3. Avoids moving too close to enemy\u2019s x-range too soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (4, 7) via incremental steps, keeping an eye on enemy\u2019s movement toward (5, 6).

If enemy goes to (5, 5) and I go to (4, 6), we could both move to (4, 5) next turn \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 5) instead, enemy at (5, 5) is adjacent horizontally, but I would move to (4, 5) next turn while enemy could move to (4, 5) too \u2192 same risk.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes to (5, 5) this turn, then:  \n- If I\u2019m at (3, 5), enemy at (5, 5), apple at (4, 5) between us. Next turn, if I go RIGHT to (4, 5) and enemy goes LEFT to (4, 5), we collide.  \nBut I could instead go UP to (3, 6) or DOWN to (3, 4) to avoid collision if I see enemy at (5, 5) next turn.  \n\nBetter to avoid that race entirely.  \n\n**Alternative plan:**  \nApple (7, 3) is also reachable, enemy is farther from it. Maybe go for (7, 3) instead to avoid conflict while enemy is near (4, 5).  \n\nFrom (3, 6), DOWN to (3, 5) then RIGHT to (4, 5) risks collision if enemy moves toward it.  \nRIGHT to (4, 6) then DOWN to (4, 5) same risk.  \n\nLet\u2019s check enemy\u2019s likely move:  \nEnemy might go for closest apple (4, 5) or (7, 3). From (6, 5), (4, 5) distance 2, (7, 3) distance 3. Likely enemy goes LEFT to (5, 5) toward (4, 5).  \n\nIf enemy goes to (5, 5), then I should avoid (4, 5) next turn.  \n\n**So this turn:**  \nUP to (3, 7) is safe but moves away from apples and reduces mobility.  \nDOWN to (3, 5) sets up possible apple grab but risks collision if enemy goes (5, 5).  \nRIGHT to (4, 6) same risk.  \n\nBut I can decide next turn based on enemy position. If enemy goes to (5, 5), I can avoid (4, 5) and go for (7, 3) later.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, DOWN gives me more options next turn: from (3, 5) I can go RIGHT to (4, 5) only if safe, else go DOWN to (3, 4) or LEFT to (2, 5) to retreat.  \nFrom (4, 6), if enemy at (5, 5), going DOWN to (4, 5) risks collision, other moves are UP (4, 7) or RIGHT (5, 6).  \n\nDOWN seems slightly safer because it keeps me farther from enemy\u2019s possible position (5, 5).  \n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nIf enemy moves toward (4, 5), consider abandoning it and heading toward (7, 3) via (4, 5) only if clear. Keep distance from enemy head, prioritize survival.  \n\n**Best choice:**  \nDOWN to (3, 5) \u2014 closer to apple, retains options to avoid collision next turn.  \n\nDOWN",

However, enemy might avoid collision to stay alive. But I cannot assume it will avoid \u2014 I should avoid the risk entirely.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is too risky. Between DOWN and LEFT, DOWN gives more safe follow-up moves (3 vs 2). DOWN also moves me toward lower board where apples (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 1) exist, away from the long enemy.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nAvoid head-on with enemy. Go DOWN to (3, 4), then consider moving toward (7, 3) via (4, 4) etc., or go for bottom apples if enemy stays top.

Instead, I should move DOWN to (5,4), positioning myself to potentially get the apple at (7,3) or (7,0) while maintaining distance from the enemy. This keeps me safe and preserves my lead.\n\n**Next turn strategy**: After moving DOWN to (5,4), I'll be positioned to move toward the apples at (7,3) and (7,0). The enemy will likely take the (4,5) apple if they move RIGHT, but that's acceptable since I maintain my lead and avoid a fatal collision.

DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe options.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- Apple at (4,5) is still available, but the enemy snake is at (3,4) which is adjacent to it\n- Apple at (7,3) is nearby and accessible\n- Apple at (7,0) is also in the area\n- Enemy snake might be heading toward the (4,5) apple\n\nRisk assessment:\n- LEFT: Moves toward (4,5) apple but could risk collision with enemy who might also go for it\n- RIGHT: Moves toward (7,3) and (7,0) apples, away from enemy\n- DOWN: Moves away from both apples and enemy, less optimal\n\nThe enemy snake at (3,4) has options:\n- UP: (3,4) \u2192 (3,5) - their own body segment, would die\n- DOWN: (3,4) \u2192 (3,3) - empty space, safe\n- LEFT: (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) - empty space, safe\n- RIGHT: (3,4) \u2192 (4,4) - empty space, safe\n\nThe enemy cannot move UP (would die), so they have DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT as options. They might choose RIGHT to get to (4,4), positioning themselves for the (4,5) apple next turn.\n\nGiven my lead (5 apples vs their 2), I should avoid risky confrontations and focus on collecting the apples in the bottom right area. Moving RIGHT positions me optimally to reach both (7,3) and (7,0) apples while maintaining distance from the enemy. This is a safe, high-reward move that preserves my advantage.\n\n**Next turn strategy**: After moving RIGHT to (6,4), I'll be well-positioned to go for the apples at (7,3) and (7,0). The enemy will likely take the (4,5) apple if they move RIGHT then UP, but that's acceptable since I maintain my lead and can collect multiple apples in the bottom right cluster. Continue avoiding head-on collisions and focus on safe apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",

From (9, 1), I can move UP to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 1) next turn. The apple collection is worth prioritizing since it extends my lead significantly.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving RIGHT to collect the apple at (9, 1), I should plan to move UP to (9, 2) to avoid getting trapped at the edge. This will position me to potentially move toward the apple at (9, 6) in subsequent turns. The enemy snake is focused on the left side of the board, giving me freedom to control the right side and collect multiple apples there.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving toward (7, 7) risks getting near enemy\u2019s territory. However, enemy\u2019s head is at (9, 4), so (7, 7) is two steps away for me, three for enemy if it goes UP then LEFT. Could race for it.  \n\nBetter to avoid risky race and collect safer apples on left while enemy is tied up on right.  \n\n**Best choice:**  \nLEFT to (4, 6) \u2014 moves toward left-side apples (1, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), which are far from enemy. Keeps distance from enemy\u2019s long body.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter LEFT, consider DOWN/LEFT toward (1, 3) or (0, 1). Avoid moving into (3, 6) or (4, 7) without checking enemy\u2019s possible moves. Keep an escape path open away from walls and enemy body.  \n\nLEFT",

Would collect it and grow\n- DOWN: (7, 7) \u2192 (7, 6) - My own body segment! Would die by moving into myself\n- LEFT: (7, 7) \u2192 (6, 7) - Empty space, safe\n- RIGHT: (7, 7) \u2192 (8, 7) - Empty space, safe\n\nDOWN is eliminated due to self-collision. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe options.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP moves directly onto the apple at (7, 8), giving me +1 apple and extending my lead to 12\n- LEFT moves away from the apple but keeps me in open space\n- RIGHT moves away from the apple but maintains mobility\n- The enemy snake is at (2, 4), which is distant and poses no immediate threat\n- UP is the optimal move as it immediately collects a nearby apple\n\nRisk assessment:\nAll three moves are safe, but UP provides immediate apple collection without any risk. After collecting the apple, my head will be at (7, 8) and my body will extend by one segment.\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving to (7, 8) and collecting the apple, I'll have 12 apples. I should then focus on avoiding my own body while planning a route toward other apples. The enemy snake appears to be heading toward the left-side apples at (2, 3) or (2, 0), so I might consider moving toward (0, 1) or (1, 3) after securing my position. My long body creates a barrier that could trap me if I'm not careful, so I should prioritize maintaining open space around my head.\n\nUP",

That means I have no safe move this turn unless something changes.  \n\nWait \u2014 check carefully:  \nMy body list is: head (1,0), then (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).  \nSo (2,0) is not in my body. Did I misread? Let\u2019s verify from board:  \nBoard shows at (2,0) there is \u2018A\u2019 (apple). Yes, apple at (2,0). So RIGHT to (2,0) is onto apple, not my body.  \n\nBut my body coordinates: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are above, not (2,0).

Then aim for nearest apple \u2014 (0,6) or (1,7) are closest, but need safe path avoiding enemy. Enemy is far top-left corner after moving to (7,9) this turn.

Both are far from me, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Next turn safety after each safe move:**  \n1. **UP to (2,2) \u2013 eat apple**  \n   After eating, my new head at (2,2), body grows by 1 (tail stays at (2,4) for now).  \n   From (2,2) next turn:  \n   - UP \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 my body (currently at (2,3)) \u2192 will be occupied unless tail moves? Wait: after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so (2,3) remains occupied next turn.

Actually eating apple means growth, so next turn tail doesn\u2019t move, so (2,2) would be new body segment, so LEFT would be invalid next turn if I eat now? Wait, I\u2019m not eating apple this turn if I go UP to (3,2). Apple at (2,2) is still uneaten, so next turn if I go LEFT from (3,2) to (2,2), I eat it then.

Wait, my current tail is at (2,3). After eating, tail stays, so body length increases by 1, so tail remains at (2,3), and new segment is at old head (3,2).

Currently, if I go UP to (3,2) now, then next turn if I go LEFT to (2,2) to eat, I die the turn after. So maybe I should not go toward that apple yet.  \n\nBetter to go RIGHT to (4,1), then maybe UP toward (5,7) or (8,4) later.  \n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

LEFT would trap me in the corner with limited mobility.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN**: After moving DOWN to (1, 8), I'll be well-positioned to target the apples at (1, 7) and (0, 6). From (1, 8), I can go DOWN to (1, 7) for the apple, LEFT to (0, 8), or RIGHT to (2, 8) (but need to check if (2, 8) remains safe as my body moves). Prioritize collecting the nearby apples while maintaining escape routes from the top-left area.\n\nDOWN",

From (7,5), safe moves are DOWN to (7,4) or LEFT to (6,5). (7,4) is open, then I can go LEFT/DOWN to open area.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, taking the apple now is safe and helps close gap.  \n\n**Best choice: DOWN** \u2014 eat apple, grow, then navigate out carefully next turn.  \n\nDOWN",

From there, I can consider moving RIGHT to (1, 3) to access the other apples in this area (2, 2) and (2, 3). The enemy snake is approaching from the right, so I should focus on clearing the bottom-left apples while maintaining an escape route upward when needed.\n\nDOWN",

UP hits my own body, LEFT is off board.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- DOWN leads to (0, 3) where there's an apple - I'll collect it and grow to 17 segments\n- RIGHT leads to (1, 4) which is empty but moves me away from the apple\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 4) and could potentially move toward me\n- Collecting the apple at (0, 3) is optimal as it increases my lead (17 vs 11)\n- After collecting this apple, I'll be positioned to access the other apples at (2, 2) and (2, 3)\n\nRisk assessment:\nBoth moves are safe this turn. DOWN collects an apple immediately and continues my safe apple collection strategy in the bottom-left corner. RIGHT moves me away from the apple and toward potential conflict with the enemy snake. Given my apple lead, I should prioritize collecting the nearby apple safely.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN**: After moving DOWN to collect the apple at (0, 3), I'll have 17 segments. From (0, 3), I can consider moving RIGHT to (1, 3) to access the apples at (2, 2) and (2, 3), or potentially move UP to (0, 4) if needed (though that would be moving back into my own body path). I should monitor the enemy snake's movement and be ready to move upward if it approaches too closely.\n\nDOWN",

Would die\n- DOWN: (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 2) - Empty cell, safe\n- LEFT: (0, 3) \u2192 (-1, 3) - Off board! Would die\n- RIGHT: (0, 3) \u2192 (1, 3) - Empty cell, safe\n\nOnly DOWN and RIGHT are safe moves. UP hits my own body, LEFT is off board.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- DOWN leads to (0, 2) which is empty but moves me toward the apple at (2, 2)\n- RIGHT leads to (1, 3) which is empty and positions me to access apples at (2, 2) and (2, 3)\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 3) and could potentially move toward me\n- I should prioritize collecting the nearby apples at (2, 2) and (2, 3) while maintaining distance from the enemy\n- RIGHT seems better as it positions me more centrally to access both apples while keeping the enemy at a safer distance\n\nRisk assessment:\nBoth moves are safe this turn. RIGHT moves me toward the cluster of apples while maintaining flexibility. DOWN moves me away from immediate apple opportunities and potentially into a corner. The enemy snake is positioned to potentially cut off access to the apples if I'm too passive.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN**: After moving RIGHT to (1, 3), I'll be positioned to move to (2, 3) for an apple next turn, or potentially (1, 2) to approach (2, 2). I should monitor the enemy snake's movement - if it moves toward me, I may need to retreat upward or find alternative paths. My long body gives me protection but also limits my mobility in tight spaces.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 no, last turn I moved from (7, 3) to (8, 3) and there was no apple at (8, 3) then. Actually, apples list shows (9, 3) still present, so I didn\u2019t eat last turn. So my length is still 14? Let\u2019s check: body length is 14 segments + head = 15 total? No: body list length is 14, head is separate, so total snake length = 15 only if I ate an apple last turn. But apples list hasn\u2019t changed from last turn\u2019s list except (7, 3) was gone already. So I didn\u2019t eat last turn, so my length is 14 segments total (head + 13 body parts). Let\u2019s count: body list length = 14, so total length = 15? That\u2019s inconsistent \u2014 wait, body list length is 14, head is separate, so total length = 15. That means I have eaten 14 apples (score says apples collected: 14). Yes, so length = 15.  \n\n**Apples:** (9, 3), (5, 6), (3, 7), (6, 0), (2, 7)  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (3, 6)  \nBody length: 19 segments + head = length 20.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safe moves from (8, 3):**  \n\n- UP \u2192 (8, 4): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 2): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 3): my body \u274c (body[0] is (7, 3))  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3): apple \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next-turn safety check:**  \n\n1. **UP to (8, 4):**  \n   From (8, 4):  \n   - UP \u2192 (8, 5): empty \u2705  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (8, 3): empty (my old head) \u2705  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (7, 4): empty \u2705  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (9, 4): empty \u2705  \n   \u2192 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 2):**  \n   From (8, 2):  \n   - UP \u2192 (8, 3): empty \u2705  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (8, 1): empty \u2705  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (7, 2): my body \u274c  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2): empty \u2705  \n   \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 3):**  \n   From (9, 3):  \n   - UP \u2192 (9, 4): empty \u2705  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (9, 2): empty \u2705  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (8, 3): empty \u2705  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 off board \u274c  \n   \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nRIGHT eats apple (9, 3) immediately, growing to length 16.  \nUP and DOWN don\u2019t eat an apple this turn.  \n\nEating apple is good for score, but need to check if eating it now traps me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 6). Possible moves from there:  \n- UP (3, 7) \u2014 apple there, maybe they go for it.  \n- DOWN (3, 5) \u2014 their body \u274c  \n- LEFT (2, 6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (4, 6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nThey are far away, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nIf I eat (9, 3), my tail stays at (7, 6) one more turn, so board opens slowly. From (9, 3) after eating, I have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). That\u2019s okay but not great \u2014 risk of being stuck in top-right corner if not careful.  \n\nUP to (8, 4) gives 4 safe moves next turn and keeps me central, able to go for (5, 6) or (3, 7) later.  \n\nGiven enemy has 19 apples (I have 14), I need to catch up but not die. Corner moves are risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAvoid trapping myself in top-right. Prefer UP now to keep flexibility, then maybe go for (5, 6) or (3, 7) while monitoring enemy. Let enemy possibly eat (3, 7) and maybe get longer but also more constrained.  \n\nUP seems safest long-term.  \n\nUP",

Would die\n\nOnly DOWN is safe. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT would all collide with my own body.\n\nStrategic analysis:\nDOWN to (2, 6) is the only viable move. This moves me away from the crowded top area and toward the bottom of the board where there are apples at (6, 0) and (6, 3). The enemy snake is positioned in the right-center area, so moving down gives me space to maneuver.\n\nRisk assessment:\nDOWN is the only safe option. I need to be careful about my long body trailing behind me - I should plan a route that avoids circling back into myself. The enemy snake appears to be heading toward the bottom-left area, so I should consider moving rightward after going down to avoid potential conflicts.\n\n**NEXT TURNS PLAN**: From (2, 6), I should consider moving RIGHT toward (3, 6) or DOWN toward (2, 5) to continue heading toward the apples at (6, 3) and (6, 0). I need to be mindful of my body segments and avoid getting trapped. The enemy snake is longer than before (14 segments vs my 22) but still poses a threat if we collide.\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s not in the list. Let\u2019s recheck: from last turn\u2019s body, after moving UP from (8,4) to (8,5), the old head (8,4) became new body[0], and the tail (7,5) was removed because no apple eaten.

Possible moves:  \n- UP (2,8): board shows T? Row y=8, x=2: T (enemy body) \u274c  \n- DOWN (2,6): board shows . \u2705  \n- LEFT (1,7): board shows T \u274c  \n- RIGHT (3,7): board shows T \u274c  \n\nSo enemy only safe move is DOWN to (2,6). That\u2019s far from me, no collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \n\nI\u2019m behind 14 vs 21 apples. Need to eat apples but stay safe.  \n\nUP gives most future options (4 safe moves next turn) and keeps central.  \nRIGHT gives path to (9,3) apple next turn (DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4) then? Actually from (9,5), DOWN to (9,4) is safe, then DOWN again to (9,3) eats apple, but after eating at (9,3), options are limited (UP, LEFT only). Risk corner trap.  \n\nLEFT moves toward (6,3) apple, but my body at (6,5) blocks direct path; need to go around.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose best option:**  \n\nUP maximizes future mobility and safety.  \nEnemy forced to (2,6), so middle may be safer.  \nFrom (8,6), can go LEFT later toward (5,6) or (6,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nFrom (8,6), consider moving toward (5,6) via (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6).  \nMonitor enemy movement; they may be stuck in their body loop but not an immediate threat.  \nKeep space, avoid boxing self in top-right.  \n\nUP",

Wait, enemy body: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9)  \nYes, (0,5) is in enemy body, so LEFT not possible for enemy.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5): enemy body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP or DOWN.  \nNeither gets enemy to (5, 6) in one move.  \n\nThus, going LEFT to eat (5, 6) is safe from immediate head-on collision with enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \n\nI\u2019m behind 14 vs 21 apples. Need to catch up.  \nEating (5, 6) now gets me to 15 apples, still far behind but progressing.  \nAfter eating, my tail will stay where it is (since I grow), so my body gets longer but tail at (4,4) won\u2019t move this turn.  \n\nFrom (5, 6) next turn, I can go DOWN to (5, 5) toward (6, 3) apple, or LEFT to (4, 6) toward center, or UP toward (9, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision this turn:**  \n\nEnemy moving UP to (1, 6) or DOWN to (1, 4) \u2014 neither is near my possible moves (6,7), (6,5), (5,6).  \nNo chance of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nLEFT to eat (5, 6) is safe, gives apple, maintains mobility.  \nUP or DOWN avoid apple but keep options open \u2014 but I need apples quickly.  \n\nBest choice: **LEFT**.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 6) after eating apple, check if enemy moved toward me. Likely go DOWN toward (6, 3) apple next, or LEFT/UP if safer. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s long body in bottom-left.  \n\nLEFT",

My body segments are: [(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9)]\n\nApples at: (9, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3), (9, 8)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (6, 6) with body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]\n\nEvaluating moves from (1, 5):\n- UP: (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 6) - Empty cell, appears safe\n- DOWN: (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 4) - Empty cell, appears safe\n- LEFT: (1, 5) \u2192 (0, 5) - My own body segment! Would die\n- RIGHT: (1, 5) \u2192 (2, 5) - My own body segment! Would die\n\nLEFT and RIGHT are immediately fatal due to my own body. Only UP and DOWN are viable options.\n\nStrategic analysis:\nUP to (1, 6) moves me toward the top area and apples at (5, 6) and (9, 8). DOWN to (1, 4) moves me toward the bottom area and apple at (6, 0).\n\nChecking enemy positions: Enemy snake head is at (6, 6), which is relatively far away. Both UP and DOWN seem safe from immediate enemy threats.\n\nRisk assessment:\nUP: (1, 6) appears empty. From there, I could move UP to (1, 7) (my body), DOWN to (1, 5) (my body), LEFT to (0, 6) (my body), or RIGHT to (2, 6) (my body). UP would give me no safe options next turn - I'd be completely surrounded by my own body.\nDOWN: (1, 4) appears empty. From there, I could move DOWN to (1, 3) (my body), UP to (1, 5) (my body), LEFT to (0, 4) (my body), or RIGHT to (2, 4) (empty). DOWN would give me only RIGHT as a safe follow-up option next turn.\n\nThis is concerning - both options appear to lead to limited mobility. Let me double-check the board state more carefully.\n\nLooking at the board visualization:\n- (1, 6) is marked as empty (.)\n- (1, 4) is marked as empty (.)\n- (2, 4) is marked as empty (.)\n\nWait, I think I'm missing something. Let me trace my body more carefully:\nMy body includes (0, 5), (2, 5), (1, 3), (0, 4), but NOT (1, 6) or (1, 4) or (2, 4).\n\nSo from (1, 5):\n- UP to (1, 6): Empty\n- DOWN to (1, 4): Empty\n- LEFT to (0, 5): My body (occupied)\n- RIGHT to (2, 5): My body (occupied)\n\nFrom (1, 6):\n- UP to (1, 7): My body (occupied)\n- DOWN to (1, 5): My body (occupied)\n- LEFT to (0, 6): My body (occupied)\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): My body (occupied)\n\nFrom (1, 4):\n- UP to (1, 5): My body (occupied)\n- DOWN to (1, 3): My body (occupied)\n- LEFT to (0, 4): My body (occupied)\n- RIGHT to (2, 4): Empty\n\nSo UP leads to a dead end with no safe moves next turn, while DOWN gives me at least RIGHT as an escape option.\n\nGiven this, DOWN is the better choice as it preserves at least one option for the next turn. I should move DOWN to (1, 4), then next turn I can move RIGHT to (2, 4) to continue toward the apple at (6, 0) while avoiding getting trapped.\n\nDOWN",

However, RIGHT is the only move that doesn't immediately kill me this turn.\n\nI have no choice but to move RIGHT to (2, 4) this turn, even though it will trap me. Next turn, I'll be forced to make an illegal move and die, but I have no other options this turn.\n\nStrategic note: My snake has wrapped around itself in a very tight pattern, leaving few escape routes.
