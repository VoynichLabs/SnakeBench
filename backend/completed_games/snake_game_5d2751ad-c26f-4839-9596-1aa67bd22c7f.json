Both LEFT and DOWN avoid enemy (at (4,9)), board edges, and collision risks. DOWN to (9,2) moves closer to lower apples like (7,1) or (6,1) on the next turn by going LEFT afterward, and keeps options open (could zigzag down-left to explore the board's center/left while monitoring enemy). However, sticking to my prior plan: after eating at (9,3), move LEFT to (8,3) per last rationale to restrict but open the left side for flexibility/navigating toward reachable left-bottom apples ((6,1) at x=6/y=1, (7,1) x=7/y=1, (2,1) x=2/y=1). From (8,3), I can then go LEFT again to (7,3) or DOWN to (8,2), pursuing a left then down path to the y=1 fruit row without head-on enemy risk (enemy at y=9 likely moving toward (6,9) at x=6/y=9). DOWN would move away from clustered apples and past the open center, potentially delaying better spots; prioritize LEFT to decrease x closer to food while leaving multiple follow-ups (e.g., LEFT324256, DOWN) and avoiding dead-ends on the right edge.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nFrom (8,3) after LEFT (assuming survival/growth), the body will be [(9,3),(9,4)]. Prioritize moving toward the y=1 apples ((6,1), (7,1), (2,1)) by going LEFT to (7,3) or (6,3) or (7,3) then DOWN. For example, LEFT again to (7,3) sets up DOWN to (7,2) or (7,1) directly if apple there\u2014eat (7,1) safely as it's on the bottom with open space. Avoid enemy head-on; they're at (4,9), potentially growing at (6,9) if they move RIGHT to x=5-6. If I take (7,3) then DOWN path, this keeps the right side clear for evasion and moves me efficiently to the apple cluster without trapping myself. Monitor if enemy descends; if so, pivot up/left or right to open rows. Reassess after next apple.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n\nLEFT",

DOWN to (8,2) is empty and safe. RIGHT to (9,3) is into my own body (current tail) and would kill me immediately.\n\nAmong safe moves, LEFT decreases x towards the clustered y=1 apples ((7,1) and (6,1) reachable after this move via further LEFT then DOWN, or LEFT then LEFT then DOWN path). It keeps multiple follow-ups open (from (7,3), could go LEFT again to (6,3), RIGHT back to (8,3), or DOWN to (7,2)), avoids moving back towards the right edge or up away from food, and steers clear of trapping on the far right while positioning for quick access to bottom apples. DOWN moves closer to y=1 but leaves me at x=8, farther from the x=6/x=7 food spots (would need to zigzag left later), though it also maintains good options like LEFT or RIGHT from (8,2). UP moves up to y=4, away from the main food cluster, potentially isolating me higher up with less immediate apple access and fewer escape routes from the top edge. Prioritize LEFT for efficiency and alignment with heading west/low to eat soon without enemy proximity risks (enemy north at (5,9) likely chasing (6,9)).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nFrom (7,3) after LEFT (assuming survival), pursue DOWN to (7,2) next turn to get to y=2, then DOWN to (7,1) the turn after to eat (7,1) and grow. This path exploits the open left column and directly targets an apple while avoiding tighter right bottom spaces. If enemy moves north or south, adjust: if they descend towards center, consider UP or LEFT evasions for more space; if they eat and grow at high y, keep pression southward to secure bottom apples before competition. Reassess enemy position after this growth move.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \n\nLEFT",
