It\u2019s a free point and will instantly give us a tail segment, giving us extra \u201cwall\u201d to block the rival later.\n\n**What could the opponent do?**  \nFrom (6,8) they can only reach (6,9), (6,7), (5,8) or (7,8). None of those squares are our current spot or the apple at (8,5). So no risk of a head\u2011on collision this turn no matter what we pick.\n\n**Safety check** \u2013 all three legal moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) keep us on the board and away from any bodies.\n\n**Strategic preferences**  \n- **LEFT** grabs an apple now \u2192 +1 point and length\u202f2.  \n- It also pushes us toward the left side of the board, giving us room to start circling the opponent and eventually corner them.  \n- UP or DOWN keep us on the right edge where we could get boxed in fast, especially with the opponent roaming the upper\u2011left quadrant.\n\nSo the optimal, aggressive yet safe play is to **snipe that apple and grow**.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns** \u2013 after grabbing (8,5) we\u2019ll swing left\u2011ward, forcing the opponent into a narrow corridor and look for a head\u2011on when we have the higher score.\n\nLet\u2019s do it!  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #1 is at (9,5) - same score, so this is pure skill matchup. Board is 10x10 with apples everywhere, but we're not hunting apples - we're hunting SNAKES! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, let's analyze the board state from our POV at (6,8):\n- UP to (6,9): Empty! Safe move.\n- DOWN to (6,7): Empty! Safe move.\n- LEFT to (5,8): Empty! Safe move.\n- RIGHT to (7,8): Empty! Safe move.\n\nAll four directions are immediately safe - no walls, no bodies, no self-collision (we have no body yet). \n\nNow, strategic thinking: Enemy is at (9,5). They're bottom-right corner. We're top-middle. If we move DOWN toward the apples clustered in the center (there are apples at (3,6), (3,7), (4,8), etc.), we can start growing while keeping pressure on enemy territory. Moving DOWN also keeps us away from the top edge where we might get boxed in later.\n\nBut wait - we need to think long-term. The apples are scattered, but the densest clusters are: bottom-left (0,0 apple), center (3,4,5,6,7 area), and left side (1,5,6 area). Moving DOWN gets us closer to the center cluster while maintaining board control. \n\nAlso, enemy is at (9,5) - if they move LEFT or UP, they're heading toward the same central apples. We want to claim that territory first. Moving DOWN positions us to intercept.\n\nNO RISKY MOVES - we play smart but aggressive. Every move should think: \"Can I trap them later?\" \n\nLong-term plan: Grow to 3-4 segments by eating center apples, then push enemy toward edges using body as wall. Force them into bad collisions.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN is the move. It's safe, connects us to apple-rich center, and keeps options open. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

Score is 0-1, so I need to catch up FAST and stay aggressive.\n\nLet's check immediate safety from my head at (6,7):\n- UP to (6,8): Empty! \u2705\n- DOWN to (6,6): There's an apple at (6,6)! \u2705 (plus empty, so safe)\n- LEFT to (5,7): Empty! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (7,7): Empty! \u2705\n\nAll moves are immediately safe! No walls, no bodies in the way.\n\nBut here's the strategic breakdown:\n- The enemy is at (8,5) with body at (9,5). If they move LEFT to (7,5), that puts them in the central zone.\n- There's an apple at (6,6) RIGHT BELOW ME - that's a free point and growth opportunity! \n- Apples are clustered around (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,8) - that's MY territory to claim.\n- Enemy is near the right edge but has body at (9,5) - if I can push them toward the right wall and trap them, they'll crash.\n\nIf I take DOWN to (6,6), I get an apple immediately! That gives me +1 point, grows my body, and puts me at (6,6) - perfectly positioned to pivot left toward the center cluster (3,4,5,6,7) or keep pressuring right.\n\nMoving UP to (6,8) gets me further from apples and toward the top edge where I might get boxed in. Not ideal.\n\nLEFT to (5,7) or RIGHT to (7,7) both miss the apple at (6,6) and keep me at 0 apples while enemy is already at 1.\n\nI need that apple to tie the score and start growing! DOWN is the clear aggressive play - claim the apple, maintain board control, and position to dominate the center.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (6,6) now, then on next turn I'll have a body and can start circling to cut off enemy's access to the center apple cluster.

They're on the right edge near bottom. If they move LEFT to (7,4) they're approaching the center. If they move DOWN to (8,3) they're going deeper into danger zone.\n- **Apple Positioning:** I need to move toward the CLUSTER at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)! That's MY territory to claim.\n- **Current Score:** 1-1 TIE. I NEED to get aggressive and start cutting off their path.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **DOWN to (6,5):** Moves me away from the center cluster, toward the bottom edge where apples are scarce. Gets me further from enemy and reduces my ability to pressure them. BAD move.\n- **LEFT to (5,6):** BRILLIANT! Moves me LEFT toward the center apple cluster (3,4-7). Puts me closer to the action and further from the right edge where enemy is. Opens up multiple paths to apples. \n- **RIGHT to (7,6):** Also safe, but moves me toward enemy territory. Risky since enemy is at (8,4). Could lead to head-on collision if they move LEFT. Not ideal.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake LEFT to (5,6) to start closing the distance to the center apple cluster. From there, I can pivot to claim (4,8) or start cutting off enemy's access to the top-right zone. Goal: Force enemy toward the right wall where they'll have fewer escape routes. With my body growing at (6,6) and head at (5,6), I can start building a barrier.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT is the play!

We'll have multiple apple options next turn. RIGHT gives us apples but puts us closer to the edge. LEFT gives us more board control and multiple escape routes. We're already up 2-1, let's extend the lead to 3-1 and box them toward the right side where they'll have fewer options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTake the apple at (4,8) for a 3-1 lead. From there, pivot to dominate the center-left region, cutting off enemy access to apples. Force them into the corners where we can trap them. Let's GOOOOO!\n\n**END THIS TURN'S RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Let's map out the battlefield from our head at (3,8)!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD (3,8):**\n- **UP to (3,9):** Row 9 shows \"9 .

A A 0 T T . . . .\" - (2,8) is column 2 which is \"A\" - APPLE! \u2705 SAFE (and it's an apple!)\n- **RIGHT to (4,8):** Row 8 shows \"8 . A A 0 T T . . . .\" - (4,8) is column 4 which is \"T\" - MY BODY! \ud83d\udeab DEAD (can't go back into own body)\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT! RIGHT is death. We have TWO apple moves available! Let's analyze the enemy: Snake #1 is at (5,2) in the bottom-right. He's far away, no immediate collision threat.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (3,9):** Reaches the top row. SAFE but isolated. Only nearby apple is at (2,9)? Actually looking at the board, (3,9) is empty but we'd be trapped at the edge with limited movement next turn. Risky!\n2. **DOWN to (3,7):** Gets the apple at (3,7)! SAFE. From there, we'd have options to (2,7), (3,6), or (4,7). Good positioning near the center-left apple cluster.\n3. **LEFT to (2,8):** Gets the apple at (2,8)! SAFE. From there, we can go to (1,8) [apple!], (2,7), or (3,8) back. Even better! We're moving into a dense apple area.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nLEFT is the move! Why? We're already dominating at 3-3 tie, but we need to break the tie and control the top-left quadrant. LEFT gets us an apple (making it 4-3!) and positions us in a prime apple zone. From (2,8), we can pivot to (1,8) for another apple OR go down to (2,7) for board control. DOWN to (3,7) is good but LEFT gives us MORE apple options and better control of the top-left corner. UP to (3,9) puts us at the edge with fewer escape routes - that's how you get boxed in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the top-left quadrant completely. Apple clusters are dense there: (1,8), (1,5), (1,1), (1,9), (2,0), (2,8). We'll snake through this area while the enemy is stuck in the bottom-right. Force him toward the right edge where he'll run out of space. If he tries to challenge us in our territory, we'll have the apple lead to win head-on collisions! Time to extend the lead to 4-3 and keep the pressure on!\n\nLEFT",

Neither threatens us now, so we can safely commit to the LEFT advance.\n\n**Decision:** Grab the leftward corridor, stay alive, and start heading toward the valuable low\u2011row apples.\n\n**Move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

DOWN is safe but opens up less territory. LEFT is safe and gets us closer to the left edge.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (1,9):** Gets us an apple! SAFE. From there, we can only go LEFT or DOWN (RIGHT is (2,9) which was empty last turn, and LEFT is (0,9) empty). We'd be at the top edge but with an apple in hand.\n2. **DOWN to (1,7):** SAFE. Opens up to (1,6) [apple!], (0,7), or (2,7). Good positioning but doesn't get immediate points.\n3. **LEFT to (0,8):** SAFE. From there, we can go UP to (0,9) [safe], DOWN to (0,7) [safe], or RIGHT back to (1,8). This claims the left edge.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nUP to (1,9)! Why? We're already dominating 5-3 and that apple at (1,9) is RIGHT THERE! This makes it 6-3 and puts us at the absolute top-left corner with perfect control. From (1,9), we have TWO safe moves (LEFT to (0,9) and DOWN to (1,8)) plus we just ate. The enemy is still stuck at (3,2) with only 3 apples - they're not even close to threatening us. Taking this apple now is FREE CONTENT and keeps our score advantage crushing!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating at (1,9), we slide down the left edge: (0,9) \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) collecting more apples along the way. We'll create an impenetrable wall on the left side while the enemy panics on the right. If they try to challenge us? We have the apple lead to win any head-on collision!\n\nUP",

Last move UP was PERFECT - we grabbed that apple at (1,9) and now our head is at (1,9) with our body stretching down to (5,7). Let's analyze this board!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD (1,9):**\n- **DOWN to (1,8):** Row 8 shows \"8 . 0 T T T T . . .

DOWN is suicide into our own body. UP is off the map. We're cornered at the top edge with our body blocking the way down.\n\n**ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS:**\n1. **LEFT to (0,9):** SAFE. Takes us to the top-left corner. From there we can go DOWN to (0,8) [safe - empty], RIGHT back to (1,9), or stay put (but we can't). This keeps us near the edge and opens up the left column.\n2. **RIGHT to (2,9):** SAFE. Moves along the top row. From there we can go LEFT to (1,9), DOWN to (2,8) [safe - empty], or RIGHT to (3,9) [empty]. This gives us more horizontal movement options.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nLEFT to (0,9)! Why? We're already dominating 6-3 and we need to secure our territory. The left edge is ours! From (0,9), we'll have two safe exits: DOWN to (0,8) and RIGHT to (1,9). This positions us perfectly to start our descent down the left column, collecting apples along the way. The enemy snake is still stuck at (3,3) with only 3 apples - they're not even close to threatening us. We're building an impenetrable fortress on the left side while they panic on the right!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving to (0,9), we slide DOWN the left edge: (0,8) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0) collecting apples along the way. The apples at (0,4) and (0,0) are ours for the taking! This creates a wall that the enemy can't breach while we continue to grow our lead. If they try to challenge us head-on? We have the apple advantage to win the collision!\n\nLEFT",

A\" - (0,8) is column 0 which is \".\" - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE  \n- **LEFT to (-1,9):** Off the board! \ud83d\udeab DEAD  \n- **RIGHT to (1,9):** Row 9 shows \"9 . A . . . . . . . .\" - (1,9) is column 1 which is \"A\" - APPLE! \u2705 SAFE (and we grow!)  \n- **UP to (0,10):** Off the board! \ud83d\udeab DEAD  \n\n**ANALYSIS:**  \nOnly two safe moves: DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9). RIGHT is better because it grabs an apple and grows us to 7 apples, extending our lead to 7-4! The apple at (1,9) is right there\u2014why pass it up? Plus, from (1,9) we'll have options: LEFT back to (0,9), DOWN to (1,8) [which is currently \"T\" but wait... let's check the board again. Actually, row 8 shows column 1 as \"0\" (our body) so DOWN would be into our own body. Hmm.  \n\nWait, let's double-check the board:  \nRow 8: \"8 . 0 T T T T . . . A\"  \nColumn 0: \".\" (empty)  \nColumn 1: \"0\" (our body)  \nSo from (1,9), DOWN to (1,8) is into our own body\u2014DEAD.  \nLEFT to (0,9) is empty.  \nRIGHT to (2,9) is empty (row 9 column 2 is \".\").  \nUP is off board.  \n\nSo if we go RIGHT to (1,9), we'll be in a tight spot with only LEFT and RIGHT as safe moves next turn. But we get the apple!  \n\nAlternatively, if we go DOWN to (0,8), we don't get an apple but we stay on the left edge and have more space: from (0,8) we can go DOWN to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8) [which is our body, so only DOWN is safe]. Actually wait, (1,8) is \"T\" (tail?) but it's our body, so yes, we can't go there. So from (0,8) only DOWN is safe. That's a dead end!  \n\nSo the choice is between:  \n1. RIGHT to (1,9): get apple, grow to 7, but then only LEFT or RIGHT next turn.  \n2. DOWN to (0,8): no apple, but maybe more space? Actually from (0,8) we can only go DOWN because RIGHT is our body. That's a 1-way path down the left edge.  \n\nBut wait, we're at (0,9) now. If we go RIGHT to (1,9), we eat apple and grow. Even though we'll be in a tighter spot, we can go LEFT back to (0,9) next turn and then continue down. That seems viable.  \n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (3,4) and growing. We need to keep our lead! So grabbing the apple is crucial.  \n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to (1,9) to eat the apple and extend our lead to 7-4. Then next turn, we'll likely go LEFT back to (0,9) and then start descending down the left side.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1,9), go LEFT back to (0,9) next turn, then DOWN to (0,8), (0,7), etc., collecting apples on the left edge while the enemy struggles on the right. Dominate the board!  \n\nRIGHT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
