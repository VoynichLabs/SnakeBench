We\u2019d have to zig\u2011zag left\u2011down\u2011left to reach the apples, wasting valuable turns and giving the opponent more time to eat or block us. No immediate growth = slower score climb.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Opponent\u2019s safe moves (they can\u2019t go DOWN)\n- Up to (2,4) \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n- Left to (1,3) \ud83d\udc48\n- Right to (3,3) \ud83d\udc49  \n\nAll are far from our current head. Even if they pick the left\u2011most path, we\u2019ll be cruising across the top row, leaving them stranded in the middle\u2011bottom corridor.\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Decision\n**LEFT** is the only move that guarantees survival, gives us +1 point, and opens the fastest route to dominate the board. By eating the top\u2011row apples we\u2019ll out\u2011score the rival before they can even think about a head\u2011on.\n\n**Next\u2011turn plan (for when the chat reminds us):**\n- Turn\u202f1: LEFT \u2192 (5,9) \u2013 grow, body = (6,9) + (7,9) (tail stays).  \n- Turn\u202f2: LEFT \u2192 (4,9) \u2013 another apple, body expands west.  \n- Turn\u202f3: LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2013 eat the last top\u2011row apple, length\u202f=\u202f4.  \n- Turn\u202f4: LEFT \u2192 (1,9) \u2013 safe, then **DOWN** to (1,8) while enemy is still down low.  \n- Turn\u202f5: HEAD\u2011RIGHT towards (8,5) or (5,5) to seize central bounty, using our long coil as a wall.\n\n**LEFT**",

It leaves us a 2\u2011segment snake, missing out on the +1 point and the future wall we need to dominate the board.  \n- **LEFT:** `(4,9)` is an **apple** and **clear** of any snake (enemy is far away). Moving left guarantees survival **and** a +1 point, while also expanding our coil to lock the top row. It\u2019s the only move that both keeps us alive **and** opens the fastest path to board domination.  \n\n**\u2705 DECISION**  \n\nAfter weighing the dead\u2011ends, growth, and future flexibility, **LEFT** is the razor\u2011sharp move that lets us *eat*, *extend*, and *control* the battlefield.

The enemy is at (3,9) with body [(4,9), (5,9), (6,9)] and 3 apples. They're STILL ahead by 1 apple! We gotta CATCH UP!\n\nLet's check our safe moves:\n- UP to (2,7): SAFE! Empty space, not off board\n- DOWN to (2,5): DEAD! That's our own body segment\n- LEFT to (1,6): SAFE! Empty space\n- RIGHT to (3,6): SAFE! Empty space\n\nWe got THREE safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. Looking at the apples - we got one at (1,6) which is LEFT from us! That's super close and we can grab it!\n\nThe enemy is still building length at the top. We need to catch up FAST! Let's grab that apple at (1,6) and keep building our length advantage!\n\nLEFT\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nYo, we're building length with that apple at (1,6)! Enemy is at (3,9) but they're ahead by 1 apple. We need to catch up FAST! Keep building length to box the enemy later. Stay in the center, avoid walls, and watch for opportunities to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Remember: grow to dominate and catch up!",
