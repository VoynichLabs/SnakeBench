Considering the enemy snake is moving upwards, I should keep an eye on its movement in case it tries to cut me off.\n\nI'd like to reassess my strategy to possibly prepare for multiple scenarios. I might need to start thinking about moving up or down as well as left to try to get closer to the apple.\n\nHmm, if I move LEFT again, I might just get too close to the wall and the edge of the board. I'd rather not get trapped at the edge, especially since I'm not sure how the enemy snake will move next.\n\nOkay, let's think about alternative moves. \n\nWait, I see that I could potentially move DOWN from my current position and then consider a LEFT or ONWARD move. But then I'd be possibly down in the same column as the apple, so it's a risk. But I don't want to just sit idle while the enemy snake potentially moves in a way to cut me off.\n\nWhat if the enemy snakes moves right, though? That could create an opportunity... \n\nAlright, I'm thinking of reassessing my plan to account for the possibility of the enemy snake heading towards me, and to consider any potential ally opportunities if it changes direction.\n\nNext move: DOWN.",

The closest apple to me is at (4, 7), but considering the enemy snake's movement pattern, I should prioritize potential future scenarios.\n\nMoving left again at this point might leave me vulnerable to getting trapped at the edge or being cut off by the enemy snake. If I move left, I'll also be neglecting the horizontal movement towards the apple and what could be potentially better later on.\n\nConsidering alternative scenarios, instead of moving left, I'd like to take a few steps back and reassess. \n\nI think I'll take into account the possibility of the enemy snake potentially moving in a way that blocks me from reaching the apple. I want to make sure I leave options for future moves to avoid confinement.\n\nIf I move down now and possibly consider moving left or onwards, I'm opening up potential paths for movement. I need to carefully balance the need to move closer to the apple in the short term with the need to plan for potential future roadblocks.\n\n... If the enemy snake moves right, it might create an opportunity... This thought is giving me an idea...\n\nWhat if I move down and try to get ahead of the potential wall? I'll leave room for shifting to the left or upwards in case the enemy's movement doesn't cut me off.\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN",
