Immediate apples are at (3,3) and (0,2), but they are quite distant. The one at (3, 3) requires moving quite a bit which could be risky given the presence of another snake. The apple at (0,2) on the other hand is closer but could involve skirting around the edge which may put me at risk of colliding with the border.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake (Snake #0), it's currently located at (8, 5) and isn't an immediate threat but I should be mindful of its movements and ensure not to cross its path or get boxed in. The enemy's current direction can't be determined from static data, so I will ignore it for immediate decision making and focus on my next move.\n\nSTRATEGY: Aim for closer and easily accessible apples while staying aware of the enemy snake to not get boxed in. \n\nAs for this move, I am considering moving towards (3,3) apple, but it seems distant for a first move after the introduction of the rules. My current thought is attempting to grab the apple at (0,2) which seems safer and faster. It is strategically sound to grow as early as possible in the game to dictate the flow and control more of the board.\n\nHowever, considering a more conservative move to avoid getting boxed out, let's head up to position ourselves more centrally which gives us more potential paths to move towards different apples.\n\nUP",

Such movement can act as a feint or a strategic repositioning, allowing me to potentially double back for the apple at (7,6) or another if necessary, and as my length increases, keeping my options open is crucial. Additionally, this move allows me a quick retreat should Snake #0's path become threatening. \n\nNext turn I will assess Snake #0's behavior closely and aim to adapt my strategy to either continue towards the apple at (7,6) through a safe route or navigate to an alternative apple while ensuring my movements are strategic and my positioning is advantageous.\n\nNext move: UP",

At this moment, there are apples at (3,3) (which we recently acquired), (5,5), (7,6), (0,2), and (6,0). Given our current location and past rationale, aiming for the apple at (7,6) still seems a primary objective, but we need to tactically move to achieve that without being boxed in or caught off guard by Snake #0.\n\nSnake #0 is currently heading towards our general direction from (8,4), with its body extending to (8,5). This path suggests its current movement strategy, but it could change at any moment, so we must anticipate several scenarios. \n\nOne strategic maneuver could involve moving diagonally to inhibit direct movement towards (7,6) and to offer us quick escape routes. Should I move RIGHT next, I could position myself optimally depending on Snake #0's next move. However, moving RIGHT without assurance of Snake #0's path could lead to a hazardous situation.\n\nConsidering the need for escape routes and strategic positioning, I choose to move DOWN this time. This movement aims to widen the gap with Snake #0 if it comes south and prepare an open path towards (7,6) or immediate retreat if necessary, ensuring that my next turn can adapt based on the enemy's movements. \n\nEnd next move: DOWN",

If Snake #0 continues heading south from (8, 4), my DOWN move could eventually be trapped if it moves left or I may run into it as it heads south. Thus, my next best move is to move LEFT, which will keep reasonable distance from (7, 6) apple but provide me a way to quickly move either UP to avoid a tailing from Snake #0 or RIGHT once it's safe to dash for the apple. Moving LEFT now also keeps my body length options open. For next turn, I'll evaluate if LEFT was smart and plan a diagonal or UP escape in continuation towards (7, 6) based on Snake #0's next move.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, my next move is: LEFT",

To counter this, rather than pursuing a straight path to (7, 6) and risking Snake #0 wrapping around or blocking me, I want to keep distance and evaluate next turn.\n\nMoving UP right now can achieve a couple objectives. First, it will provide some breathing space from Snake #0 as it allows me to potentially avoid a nook that Snake #0 might leverage. Second, moving UP now sets me up for a quick change in plan if needed, i.e., I could shift LEFT to target the apple in (6, 0) or RIGHT at a later turn for the targeted (7, 6).\n\nMy strategic advice to myself for the next turn will be to reassess Snake #0's position and evaluate the current apple positions.

However, it also means Snake #0 might try to move towards (8, 0) or (8, -1 range which it can't) and then come back up, which could lead to a potential collision course if it aims for the middle. Therefore, taking a conservative UP move now could help maintain separation and preserve options for the next turn.\n\nAssessing my next steps: By moving UP to (4, 2), I put myself in a good position to react to Snake #0's next move. Positioning closer to the top row gives me the choice of going UP again to ensure safety, LEFT or RIGHT if Snake #0 moves predictably, or even DOWN later if I seek to chase apples towards my bottom or middle row choices like (3, 3) or (6, 0) strategically. \n\nStrategy for next turn: Depending on Snake #0's move, if it continues down, I can aim to make a play for either (6, 0) or (7, 6) next, depending on if it obstructs a route. If it loops around or starts heading in a different direction, a quick survey of the board will allow for an opportunistic shift in strategy. \n\nNext move: UP",
