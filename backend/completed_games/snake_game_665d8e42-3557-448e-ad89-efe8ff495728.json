Check self-collision/bounds:**\n*   **UP (9, 4):** Safe (within bounds, no body).\n*   **DOWN (9, 2):** Safe (within bounds, no body).\n*   **LEFT (8, 3):** Safe (within bounds, no body).\n*   **RIGHT (10, 3):** Out of bounds (X=10). **Eliminated.**\n\n*Since my body is empty, the backward move check is trivial (no body to hit).*\n\nPotential safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Check interactions with Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (1, 7)):**\nSince the enemy head is far away at (1, 7), none of the potential moves (to (9,4), (9,2), or (8,3)) will result in an immediate body collision if the enemy stays put.\n\nHowever, the enemy moves simultaneously. We must predict the enemy's move. Since the enemy has no immediate threat or apple destination apparent, it will likely move towards the nearest apple or a safe/neutral location. The nearest apples to (1, 7) are (1, 2) (distance 5) and (3, 8) (distance $\\sqrt{2^2+1^2} \\approx 2.23$). (3, 8) is closer diagonally. Let's see where the enemy might go.\n\nEnemy options from (1, 7):\n*   UP (1, 8): Safe for enemy.\n*   DOWN (1, 6): Safe for enemy.\n*   LEFT (0, 7): Safe for enemy.\n*   RIGHT (2, 7): Safe for enemy.\n\n**A. Analyze Move UP to (9, 4):**\n*   My next position: (9, 4).\n*   Enemy next positions include (1, 8), (1, 6), (0, 7), (2, 7).\n*   No collision possible this turn.\n*   (9, 4) is relatively central and open. Good for accessing apples (7, 6) or (7, 9) later by moving LEFT.\n\n**B. Analyze Move DOWN to (9, 2):**\n*   My next position: (9, 2).\n*   No collision possible this turn.\n*   (9, 2) is closer to apple (1, 2) than (9, 4) is, but still far. Moving LEFT from here is generally good.\n\n**C. Analyze Move LEFT to (8, 3):**\n*   My next position: (8, 3).\n*   No collision possible this turn.\n*   This moves me towards the center area where apples (4, 3) and (7, 6) are located. This seems strategically better for opening up pathways to eat.\n\n**3. Comparison and Long-Term Strategy:**\nI am currently at the right edge (X=9). Moving LEFT opens up board space exploration immediately. Moving UP or DOWN keeps me stuck near the edge until I move LEFT.\n\nThe nearest apple in terms of Manhattan distance that is generally accessible is (4, 3) (distance 5) and (7, 6) (distance 7). (1, 2) is distance 8.\n\nMoving to (8, 3) puts me adjacent (X-wise) to where I would need to go to approach (7, 6) or (4, 3). An immediate LEFT move seems the most proactive way to start closing the gap to central/left apples.\n\nStrategy Note: Since I am playing defensively against one opponent far away, I will prioritize moving towards the nearest accessible apple cluster while remaining safe. Moving LEFT brings me closer to apples (4, 3) and (7, 6).\n\nMove choice: LEFT to (8, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Collision Check with Predicted Enemy Moves:**\nMy current potential next positions: (8, 4), (8, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3).\nNone of these overlap with the enemy's plausible next positions: (2, 8), (2, 6), (1, 7), (3, 7). No immediate collision this turn.\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\nMy priority is moving towards the nearest apples: (4, 3) and (7, 6).\n*   Current position (8, 3).\n*   **LEFT (7, 3):** Moves me one step closer to (4, 3) and (7, 6). This keeps me moving generally towards the cluster of apples on the left/center.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 3):** Moves me back to the edge. Less strategically useful unless I need to maneuver around something.\n*   **UP (8, 4) / DOWN (8, 2):** Neutral vertical moves, not progressing towards the targets as well as LEFT.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 3) seems the strongest choice, continuing the central approach.\n\nStrategy Note: Continue moving towards the center/left to intercept apples (4, 3) or (7, 6). Maintain distance from the edge if possible without sacrificing progress. Enemy is targeting (3, 8), which is far enough away that I don't need to significantly change course yet.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",

Since the opponent's move is not explicitly given from the previous turn's output, I must rely on the board state provided for the start of *this* turn, which shows Snake #0 at (1, 7) with body (none) in the first board visualization, and then Snake #0 at (2, 7) with body (none) in the second visualization, and the move that resulted in *this* state after my move 'LEFT' was from (8,3) to (7,3).\n\nLet's synchronize the state information transition, as the provided \"LAST MOVE PICK\" block seems to summarize the *previous* turn's context and result, and the current state must reflect the result of *both* my move (LEFT) and the opponent's simultaneous move.\n\n**Reconciling State:**\n1. **Start of Turn 2:** My Head (9, 3). Enemy Head (1, 7).\n2. **My Move (T2):** RIGHT. New position (10, 3) -> FATAL unless the board state provided for T3 reflects the *actual* outcome of my T2 move.\n3. **Analysis of T2 Output:** The \"START LAST MOVE PICK / END LAST MOVE PICK\" block indicates my move was RIGHT. The rationale *following* that block shows the state *after* my move RIGHT, which is Head (8, 3), implying my previous move was NOT RIGHT (or the board visualization is from T1 end/T2 start, and the rationale is describing my T2 move which resulted in the state shown for T3 start).\n\nLet's strictly follow the explicit structure:\n1. **T2 Start State (Implied):** My Head (9, 3). Enemy Head (1, 7). Move picked: RIGHT.\n2. **T2 Result State (Described in Rationale Block preceding T3 start):** My Head (8, 3). Snake #0 Head (2, 7). (This implies the opponent moved UP from (1, 7) to (2, 7) or RIGHT from (1, 7) to (2, 7) if they moved right). My move RIGHT from (9, 3) should result in (10, 3), which is off the board, *unless* my initial position for T2 was NOT (9, 3) or my move RIGHT was not executed, or the initial state description of T2 was wrong.\n\nLet's trust the provided *state snapshot* preceding the decision logic for Turn 3:\n**Current State (Start of Turn 3):**\n*   My Head: (7, 3). My Body: (8, 3). Length 2. (This result is consistent with moving LEFT from (8, 3), which was the *second* move mentioned in the context).\n*   Enemy Head: (1, 7). Body: (2, 7) OR Enemy Head: (2, 7). Body: none. (The Board state shows 0 at (1, 7) in the T2 description, and 0 at (2, 7) in the T3 description analysis).\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I must prioritize the board state shown immediately before my actual move decision for **Turn 3**, which is derived from the state shown in the block *after* my T2 move (which resulted in Head (8,3), then T3 start).\n\n**Re-evaluating based on the *explicit* T3 context provided:**\nCurrent Head: (7, 3), Body: (8, 3). (My move LEFT from (8, 3) this turn).\nEnemy Head: (1, 7). Body: none. (This implies the enemy moved from (2, 7) to (1, 7) or (1, 7) was its T2 position).\n\nSince the problem explicitly shows the result of the *last* move pick (LEFT) resulting in (7, 3) with body (8, 3) for me, and the opponent is now at (1, 7) (which is where the opponent was at T2 start, implying the opponent moved *backwards* or stayed put relative to their T2 start position, suggesting the opponent moved DOWN to (2, 6) or LEFT to (1, 7) from (2, 7)), I will assume the opponent is now at (1, 7) and I am at (7, 3) with (8, 3) as a tail segment.\n\n**Turn 3 Analysis (Head at (7, 3), Body: (8, 3), Length 2)**\nApples: (1, 2), (4, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (3, 8).\nNearest apple to me: (4, 3) (Distance 3) or (7, 6) (Distance 3).\n\n**Potential Moves from (7, 3):**\n1. **UP (7, 4):** Moves towards (7, 6).

Moving LEFT to (6, 3) maintains a path along the bottom half of the board, which seems less congested than the top half where the enemy is concentrated. It brings me immediately adjacent (horizontally) to the (4, 3) apple path.\n\nLet's choose **LEFT** to pursue (4, 3).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Prioritize closest apples (4, 3) then (7, 6). Snake #0 is focused on (3, 8). Maintain mobility and avoid boxing myself in, especially on this early stage where board control matters. Since I have length 2, I need to eat soon to prevent being easily trapped relative to longer snakes if they appear.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (7, 3) with body (8, 3).

Snake #0 seems to be heading towards the upper central region. Being along $Y=3$ is strategically sound for now.\n\nPotential safe moves from (6, 3): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (to 7, 3) are all safe from self-collision as the body segments are (7, 3) and (8, 3). Right is back to (7, 3) which is safe, but less progress than U/D/L.\n\nIf I move UP (6, 4), I approach (7, 6) obliquely.\nIf I move LEFT (5, 3), I proceed directly towards (4, 3).\n\nI will continue prioritizing the direct path to (4, 3).\n\nStrategy Note: Continue aggressively towards (4, 3). Keep an eye on the enemy's proximity to that area, though currently, they seem directed elsewhere (towards Y=8).

This is less important than me scoring, but I should avoid wasting too much time chasing apples on the opposite side of the board from their current engagement range unless they have secured many apples already (which is not the case, 0 vs 0).\n\nGoing DOWN seems better as (1, 2) is closer (3 steps) than (7, 6) (5 steps, accounting for vertical distance).\n\nMove DOWN to (4, 2).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Target (1, 2) next, then navigate towards (7, 6) or (7, 9).

If score >= 4, the game continues, likely until turn limit or until one snake dies, as there are no more apples. I must maximize safety and try to lure the enemy to die, or keep moving until T=150.\n\nSince the enemy scored 1 point previously (implied by Turn 10 calculation), Score 4 vs Score 1 means I win immediately as all apples are gone.\n\nThe game must end here if the assumption about the enemy score holding at 1 is correct, as all apples are gone. If the game continues, moving LEFT towards (6, 9) seems slightly more central than moving right to (8, 9) to avoid getting trapped against the top/right edges if movement becomes forced later.\n\nAssuming immediate win due to all apples consumed and current score advantage: I select a safe move, although the game state dictates the outcome regardless of the next move unless the engine requires one final move. Since the prompt implies taking a move for Turn 11, standard practice is to make a safe move away from edges if the game continues, but here, the game should conclude. I will play LEFT (6, 9) as a default safe move if forced.\n\nLEFT",

If they are small, they pose little threat to me unless they are positioned to intersect my long body path or move directly onto my head. Since I have consumed 4 apples, my snake is massive (~22 segments). My body structure is roughly: X=7 (Y=4 to Y=9), X=6, 5, 4 + Y=3 line segment + X=1, 2, 3 + Y=2 line segment + X=4/5/6 line segment.\n\nThe snake body is long and complex. Moving LEFT to (6, 9) steps away from the edge (8, 9) and potentially provides more maneuvering room if the engine prioritizes random movement for snakes with no apples left.\n\n**Strategic Choice:** Maximize survival by avoiding the edge and moving towards the center-top area where current body density is lower.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake (ID 1) moved LEFT to (6, 9) from (7, 9).

If the previous head was (3, 8) and body was L=22, the new tail moves out.\nIf my snake is long, (3, 8) might be occupied by the segment that was directly behind the head (4, 8) which is now (3, 8) relative to the new head (2, 8). No, the move was LEFT: (3, 8) -> (2, 8). The old head (3, 8) is now segment 2. The segment that was segment 22 moves out.\n\nLet's confirm safety for (3, 8): Since (4, 8) was segment 2, and my move was LEFT, (4, 8) becomes segment 3, (5, 8) becomes segment 4, etc. The cell (3, 8) is *safe* unless the tail just moved out of that location. My previous tail was at (3, 7) [if my tracking was perfect]. Since the body structure is complex, I rely on the general safety check (not hitting a cell that was occupied by the body *before* the tail segment was shed).\n\nIf I assume the engine correctly verifies collisions: Moving RIGHT to (3, 8) is likely illegal because (3, 8) was occupied by the previous head's movement path unless the tail shed exactly from there. Given the ambiguity, I avoid RIGHT.\n\nValid Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nMove LEFT to (1, 8). Continue hugging the top left edge.\n\nMove LEFT to (1, 8).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue oscillation (UP/DOWN/LEFT) along Y=8/9 near X=0/1. Score 4 vs 1, guaranteed win by T=150 if no self-collision.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Based on last move UP to (3, 9) from (3, 8), Head must be (3, 9) if the move was legal.** Recalculating based on last chosen move: UP.\n\n**Recalculating Head Position based on previous Rationale Chain:**\nLast move chosen was UP to (3, 9) from (3, 8).\nHead: (3, 9).\n\n**Safety Check (Head at (3, 9)):**\n1. UP: Off board. FATAL.\n2. DOWN (3, 8): Hits body segment (3, 8). FATAL (ILLEGAL) based on the logic: (3, 8) was the cell the head just left. If the snake is long, the body has moved, but (3, 8) is the immediate precursor segment unless the tail has moved past this location.\n    * Chain check: (3, 9) came from (3, 8). Assuming the body segment (3, 8) is now segment #2, moving DOWN to (3, 8) is a collision.\n3. LEFT (2, 9): Safe, previously traversed cell.\n4. RIGHT (4, 9): Safe, previously traversed cell.\n\n*Crucially, if the snake is 22 segments long, the tail has vacated 15 cells since it was 7 segments long (Turn 5). We are now past turn 15. The movement on X=1 for 7 moves cleared the path downwards below Y=6.*\n\nSince the previous step logic confirmed (3, 8) was occupied by the body segment (3, 8) *before* the move, and the body shifts: If Head moves from $H_{old}$ to $H_{new}$, $H_{old}$ becomes segment 2. Moving $H_{new} \\to H_{new} - \\text{direction}$ is only safe if $H_{old}$ has already vacated that cell due to tail movement. In a standard non-growing snake, this move **must** be illegal if $H_{old}$ is segment 2.\n\nGiven the complexity and the long history of successful oscillations centered on Y=8/9, I must re-evaluate my assumption about the immediate collision (3, 8). Since the snake is long (22 segments), the tail has moved out, and the segment at (3, 8) has likely moved down the tail chain.\n\nLet's check the safety again, trusting the safe oscillation pattern we established:\n(3, 9) $\\leftarrow$ UP from (3, 8). Body: (3, 8) is segment 2.\nIf standard body movement: Down to (3, 8) hits segment 2. FATAL.\n\nThe previous rationale for move choice UP to (3, 9) was: \"Move UP to (3, 9) to repeat the horizontal sweep.\" This implies DOWN (3, 8) *should* have been checked against the body map.\n\nIf DOWN is blocked, we choose LEFT (2, 9) or RIGHT (4, 9).\nWe chose RIGHT successfully in the previous turn to (4, 9). Moving RIGHT to (4, 9) again seems best to continue the sweep along the edge.\n\nLet's re-examine the history before the move to (3, 9):\nWe were safe at (3, 8). We chose UP $\\to$ (3, 9).\nLast state evaluation: \"We must move UP or DOWN. If we move DOWN to (3, 7), we initiate a descent. If we move UP to (3, 9), we complete the top edge traverse. Let's descend safely. Move DOWN to (3, 7).\" -> **ERROR: The rationale stated DOWN but the pick chose UP.** I chose UP in the rationale *after* stating I would descend. This means my intended move was UP (to 3, 9), which was executed.\n\nIf (3, 8) is now segment 2, DOWN is illegal.\nIf (2, 9) and (4, 9) are safe, we can oscillate between them.\n\nMove RIGHT to (4, 9) to continue the top edge sweep.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 at Head: Unknown.
