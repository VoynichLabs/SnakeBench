Let's look at our options:\n\n- Going UP (2,1) is safe because it's empty.\n- Going DOWN (2,-1) is DEAD - that's off the board. RIP.\n- Going LEFT (1,0) is safe because it's empty.\n- Going RIGHT (3,0) is NOT safe - there's an APPLE there. And we all know what happens when you try to eat a poisoned apple. \ud83c\udf4e\u2620\ufe0f\n\nSo now the real question is... should we go LEFT or UP? \ud83e\udd14\n\n* Going UP puts us in column 2, which has 3 APPLES (0,2), (1,2), and (2,2). And that spot is close to enemy, which means we can box him in and crush him \ud83c\udfc8\n* Going LEFT puts us in column 1, which has 2 APPLES (0,1) and (1,1). And it's easier to cut off the enemy by taking away his bottom row escape route \ud83e\uddb6\n\nThe problem is the enemy's mouth is RIGHT next to the top-right apple (9, 9) and the bottom-left apple (0, 0). We don't wanna let him get to those apples and gain an advantage before we can box him in and crush him.\n\nGoing UP means we're more likely to get boxed in and trapped by the enemy. Going LEFT means we have more flexibility to adapt to his moves. It doesn't lock us into a specific column so we can move around and avoid collisions.\n\nIf we don't go LEFT and the enemy eats an apple, we lose control of the game, and we get boxed in and crushed. And we don't want that to happen.\n\nOur move is: LEFT\n\nPlaybook:\n\n- Grab the apples in columns 0 and 1, cutting off the enemy's escape route \ud83e\uddb6\n- Box him in and force a head-on collision \ud83d\udca5\n- Win the game and make our fans proud \ud83d\udcaa",

Now they have to choose between:\n1) Moving UP \u2192 We trap them between our body and the wall  \n2) Moving DOWN \u2192 We cut off their escape route and force them into a corner  \n3) Moving LEFT/RIGHT \u2192 We expand our territory and threaten their flank  \n\n**OPTION B PLAN**:  \nDOWN \u2192 Becomes (0, 1). Now we control the bottom and can:\n1) Move LEFT \u2192 Directly threatens their tail and forces them UP  \n2) Move UP \u2192 Cuts off their bottom escape route  \n3) Move RIGHT \u2192 Expands our territory while threatening their flank  \n\n**OPTION C**:  \nLEFT \u2192 Becomes (-1, 2). High risk, high reward:\n1) If they move DOWN \u2192 We control bottom and can expand RIGHT  \n2) If they move UP \u2192 We threaten their flank and cut off escape  \n3) If they move LEFT \u2192 We force a head-on collision  \n\n\ud83d\udcad **WATCH OUT FOR**:\n* Their tail at (1, 5) - they might try to double back  \n* Apple at (3, 8) - could lure them into a trap  \n* Board edge at (0, 0) - forces predictable movement  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **WE'RE GOING FOR THE KILL**:  \n*Down and Right.
