I can see there are still apples at (1, 0) and (0, 2) that I can target.\n\nIf I continue LEFT to (5, 0), I'll be moving toward the apple at (1, 0), but I need to be very careful about the enemy snake #1. The enemy snake's head is at (3, 0) - wait, that's exactly where there was an apple! The enemy snake likely just ate the apple at (3, 0) and is now blocking my direct path along the bottom row.\n\nLooking more carefully at the enemy snake #1 at position (3, 0) with body at [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)], if I continue LEFT along the bottom row, I'll run directly into the enemy snake's head at (3, 0) in a few moves. That's dangerous.\n\nHowever, if I move UP to (6, 1), I'll be moving away from the immediate apple opportunities but I'll have more space to maneuver and potentially approach apples from different angles.\n\nLet me think strategically: The apple at (1, 0) is still available, but getting there means going past or around the enemy snake. The apple at (0, 2) might be a better target if I move UP and then work my way around.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the immediate threat. If I go LEFT to (5, 0), then LEFT again to (4, 0), I'd be right next to the enemy snake at (3, 0). That could be risky depending on where the enemy moves.\n\nI think the safer play is to move UP to (6, 1) to give myself more options and avoid a potential collision course with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, assess whether I can safely approach the apple at (1, 0) by going around the enemy snake, or if I should target other apples like the one at (0, 2) or the ones further up the board.\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

It gives me good positioning for future moves\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (5, 2), continue RIGHT to (6, 2) to grab the apple there.

This is still my most efficient target.\n\nThe apple at (7, 5) is also close - I could reach it by going RIGHT then UP.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (0, 1) on the far left side with a long body, so it's not an immediate threat to any of the apples I'm targeting.\n\nStrategic thinking:\n1. Continuing UP to (6, 5) keeps me on the direct path to the closest apple at (6, 8)\n2. This route is completely safe - no collision risks\n3. I'm maintaining good central positioning with multiple apple options\n4. The enemy snake is still far away, so I don't need to rush or change strategy\n\nI think my original plan is working well. Continue straight up toward (6, 8) since it's the most efficient route to guaranteed points.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward (6, 8). After collecting that apple, reassess and likely target either (7, 5) or (5, 8) depending on enemy snake position.\n\nMy decided next move: UP"

The enemy snake and apples are somewhere else on the board, but for now our immediate concern is avoiding a collision.\n\nConsidering the adjacent squares from our head at (0,1):\n\u2022 UP: (0,2) is occupied by our body.\n\u2022 RIGHT: (1,1) is occupied by our body.\n\u2022 LEFT: That would be (-1,1), which is off board.\n\u2022 DOWN: (0,0) is free.\n\nEven though our closest apple might be at (0,9), our snake\u2019s body is currently in the way on the upward path. Moving DOWN to (0,0) is the only safe move. In doing so, our tail will eventually move away, opening up new paths later.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move: DOWN."
