So UP is a setup for a deadly dead end in a couple turns.\n- DOWN to (0,5) keeps multiple escape options open and avoids immediate self-collision, giving me flexibility to navigate toward future apples while remaining on the edge.\n\nPlan:\n- Take the safe route: move DOWN to (0,5) now. This preserves space to maneuver, avoids the edge trap, and allows a natural progression toward the central area to reach other apples (e.g., heading right to approach apples around the middle and bottom rows) while keeping distance from Snake #0’s current position.\n- After that, head toward (1,5) and then (2,5) to widen options, with the goal of reaching the apple at (4,2) or the right-side apples (7,4) or (7,5) if feasible without risking head-on collisions. Maintain awareness of enemy movements and avoid tight corridors that could lead to self-collision or traps.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head is at (1,5) and can only move DOWN to (1,4) or RIGHT to (2,5), so no head‑on risk with either of our options.\n\nThe nearest apple is at (4,2); moving UP reduces the Manhattan distance from 3 to 2, while LEFT would increase it. The path after UP (right twice) is clear of any snake bodies or obstacles. Therefore UP gives the best immediate progress toward an apple while keeping options open.\n\n**Short‑term plan**\n1. Move UP to (2,2).\n2. Next turn aim RIGHT twice to capture the apple at (4,2).\n3. After eating, reassess surrounding space; likely head toward the cluster of apples on the right side (7,4)/(7,5).\n\nUP",
