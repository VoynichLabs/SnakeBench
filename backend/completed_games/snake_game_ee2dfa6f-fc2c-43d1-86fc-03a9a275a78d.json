We're fresh, turn zero, nobody's got any body yet, but that's about to change!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head at (4, 5). No body segments. 0 apples.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head at (1, 9). No body segments. 0 apples.\n*   **Apples nearby:** (5, 5) right next to me! (6, 6) is not an apple, wait, (6, 6) is not an apple. (6, 3) is a bit further. The closest apples are (5, 5) and (6, 0).\n\n**The Enemy's Position:**\nSnake #0 is way up in the top-left corner at (1, 9). They are looking to move. They probably want to go right towards (6, 9) or maybe down. Their options are DOWN to (1, 8) (an apple!) or RIGHT to (2, 9). UP and LEFT are instant death off the board.\n\n**My Strategy - Aggressively Grow!**\nSince it's turn 0 and we have no bodies, the primary goal is to eat some apples fast and establish dominance. We have an apple *right* next to us at (5, 5). That's a must-grab!\n\n**Safety Check (My Snake):**\nMy head is at (4, 5).\n1.  **UP (4, 6):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 4):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 5):** Safe, AND it's an apple! \ud83e\udd11\n\n**Opponent Clash Check:**\nThe opponent is at (1, 9). There is literally no way for us to collide head-on this turn, even if we both tried to zoom across the board. We are completely isolated.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nGoing RIGHT to (5, 5) secures the first apple and gives us a body segment immediately. This growth is crucial for controlling space later. We start with the content!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (For Future Self):**\nGrab the (5, 5) apple. Next turn, look to move towards the center/right side of the board (e.g., (6, 3) or (6, 0) apples) to keep away from the top-left corner where Snake #0 is currently dominant, but always be ready to cut them off if they come too far down. Focus on growing larger than them!\n\nLet's get this $W$, chat! Time to eat! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

But we got the first body segment, baby!\n\nWe're at Turn 1, and the game is heating up! We need to keep that aggressive pressure on and grow faster than the archrival!\n\n**Current State Analysis and Strategy:**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head at (5, 5). Body at [(4, 5)]. Length 2. 1 Apple. We are looking strong, right in the center of the board.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head at (1, 8). Body at [(1, 9)]. Length 2. 1 Apple. Looks like they went down onto an apple at (1, 8) last turn. Smart play, but they are still cornered up there.\n\n**Goal for this turn:** Maintain momentum, grab another apple, and start moving to a position where we can control the center and potentially cut off Snake #0 if they try to move down the left side.\n\n**Looking at Apples:**\nThe closest apples are:\n1.  (6, 3) - South-East\n2.  (6, 0) - Far South-East\n3.  (2, 3) - South-West\n\nWe are currently at (5, 5).\n\n**Safety Check (My Snake):**\nWe must avoid our own body segment at (4, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (5, 6):** Safe. Moves towards the open center-top area.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 4):** Safe. Moves towards the apple at (6, 3).\n3.  **LEFT (4, 5):** **DEAD!** That's our body segment! NO!\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 5):** Safe. Moves towards the apple at (6, 3).\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 8)):**\nTheir body is at (1, 9).\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (1, 9): DEAD (into their own body).\n*   DOWN (1, 7): Safe.\n*   LEFT (0, 8): DEAD (off the board).\n*   RIGHT (2, 8): Safe.\n\nThey are stuck on the left side. They will likely move DOWN to (1, 7) to start exploring the left flank, or RIGHT to (2, 8) to get closer to the center.\n\n**Optimal Move Selection:**\n\nWe want to move into a position that simultaneously brings us closer to the next apple AND establishes central control.\n\n*   Moving **UP (5, 6)** is good for opening up the board, but not immediately close to an apple.\n*   Moving **DOWN (5, 4)** or **RIGHT (6, 5)** brings us closer to the (6, 3) apple. (5, 4) is 1 move away from (5, 3), and (6, 5) is 1 move away from (6, 4).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 5), we are one step closer to the right side and position ourselves well for the (6, 3) apple. (6, 5) is a super open area.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 4), we are moving away from the area where Snake #0 might be coming down (the left side), but we are also slightly less positioned to cut them off if they try to come aggressively towards the center (3, 8), (4, 8), etc.\n\nLet's maintain central, upper-middle presence for now to monitor Snake #0. Moving **RIGHT (6, 5)** keeps us in a strong central position, opens up a clear path to the (6, 3) apple, and sets us up to dominate the right half of the board. This is an aggressive move towards growth and board control.\n\nWe're going RIGHT, chat! Time to stretch our legs and find more content!\n\n**Future Strategy Note (To Myself):**\nNext turn, depending on where Snake #0 goes, aim for the (6, 3) apple or continue moving up the right edge to secure the (8, 8) or (7, 8) cluster before they can get there. Don't let them drop into the bottom half easily.\n\nRIGHT",

We made a clean move to the right, snagged some prime center-right real estate, and now we're looking to turn up the heat! \ud83d\udd25 Our archrival, Snake #0, is still bottled up in the top-left corner. Perfect!\n\nTurn 2 is here. Let's analyze the board and execute the next phase of our master plan!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head at (6, 5). Body at [(5, 5)]. Length 2. 1 Apple. We are positioned aggressively\u2014right on the center median, ready to strike!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head at (0, 8). Body: [(1, 8), (1, 9)]. Length 3. **Wait**, Snake #0 is now 3 segments long! They must have also eaten an apple. Looking at the board, the apple at (1, 8) in the previous state is now gone, and their body list is now [(1, 8), (1, 9)]. That means they moved LEFT from (1, 8) to (0, 8) and ate an apple! Cunning, but they hit the wall! They are now truly cornered.\n*   **Scoreboard Check:** Me: 1 apple. Them: 2 apples. They are ahead! **UNACCEPTABLE CHAT!** We need to close this gap immediately!\n\n**Goal for this Turn:** Get an apple and start boxing in Snake #0 from the center.\n\n**Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (6, 5)):**\nMy body segment is at (5, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the top apples (6, 9) and the cluster around (7, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the apple at (6, 3). VERY attractive.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** **DEAD!** Hitting my own body. NOPE.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe. Moves along the middle towards the edges.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (0, 8)):**\nTheir body segments are [(1, 8), (1, 9)]. They are literally RIGHT against the left wall (x=0).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (0, 9): Safe. They climb along the wall.\n*   DOWN (0, 7): Safe. They move down the wall.\n*   LEFT (-1, 8): **DEAD!** Off the board.\n*   RIGHT (1, 8): **DEAD!** Into their own body!\n\nSnake #0 can only move UP or DOWN. They are totally restricted. This is HUGE for us, chat!\n\n**Optimal Move Selection & Strategy:**\n\nWe need to catch up on points! The closest, best-positioned apple for us is at **(6, 3)**.\n\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (6, 4) puts us one safe step toward the (6, 3) apple. It also keeps us away from the top area where Snake #0 is limited.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 5) keeps us central but doesn't immediately advance on an apple.\n*   Moving **UP** to (6, 6) heads for the top, but (6, 3) is closer and easier to secure quickly.\n\nLet's capitalize on the easy point! Move DOWN! This sets us up to grab the apple at (6, 3) on the next turn, bringing us to a tie (2-2) in apples, and giving us the chance to dominate the bottom half while Snake #0 struggles in the top left.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 7), they are still far away. If they move UP to (0, 9), they are REALLY stuck in that corner. Our move DOWN is safe and aggressive toward the score!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (The Box):**\nOnce we secure the apple at (6, 3), we should start moving either left (to control the center-bottom) or aggressively up the right edge (x=7, 8, 9) to grab the top-right apples (7, 8), (8, 8), (5, 9) before Snake #0 can cross the board to get them. We're aiming to starve them out or force them into an impossible crash!\n\nDOWN",

Both keep us alive, but which one opens the map for future domination?  \n\n- Moving UP rockets us to the very top edge. Great for grabbing apples like (5,9) or (9,9) later, but we\u2019ll be stuck against the wall with only ONE way back in (and that way is blocked by our own tail).  \n- Moving DOWN drops us into the middle of the board where the apple density is higher \u2014 check those apples at (2,3), (3,2), (1,4), etc. It also frees up (0,8) for our growing body and gives us room to swing right later without instantly hitting a wall.  \n\nWhat about the rival? He\u2019s probably eyeing those apples up top, but if we go UP and he decides to chase us upward, we could end up in a head\u2011on collision next turn. Dropping DOWN keeps us out of his immediate line of sight and lets us set up a sneaky cut\u2011off later. \ud83e\udd14  \n\nPlan: keep the body growing downwards, funnel toward the apple cluster around y=3\u20114, and set a trap that forces the rival into a corner while we maintain multiple escape routes.

Are we about to tie the score?!\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-EVALUATION:**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is now at **(6, 4)**. Body is at [(6, 5)]. Length 2. We are one step away from that juicy apple at (6, 3)!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(0, 7)**. Body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)]. Length 3.\n    *   What happened? Snake #0 moved from (0, 8) to (0, 7)! They moved DOWN! They are still hugging the left wall, maintaining their limited maneuverability. This is excellent news for us!\n\n**Scoreboard Check:** Me: 1 apple. Them: 2 apples. We need to tie this up, CHAT!\n\n**Goal for this Turn:** Grab the apple at (6, 3) and tie the score! (2-2)\n\n**Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (6, 4)):**\nMy body segment is at (6, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** **DEAD!** Hitting my own body (the tail segment from the *previous* turn is now *my* body segment). Remember, the head moves one cell, and the tail only moves if we *don't* eat an apple! Since we didn't eat one this past turn, our body grew to include our old head position (6, 5). Wait, no, that's wrong. Since we didn't eat, the tail moves. The new body is (6, 5). Let's re-read the body list: Head: (6, 4), Body: [(6, 5)]. So (6, 5) *is* the body segment we are hitting. **FATAL!**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** This is the location of an apple! Safe. **LET'S GOOO!**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Safe. Moves us towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe. Keeps us wide.\n\nWe have a clear path to the apple! We take the point and gain length!\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (0, 7)):**\nBody segments are [(0, 8), (1, 8)]. They are still stuck on the x=0 wall.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (0, 8): **DEAD!** Into their own body segment (0, 8)! Wait, their body shifted. If they moved from (0, 8) to (0, 7), their new body is [(0, 8), (1, 8)]. Ah, I see. Since they did not eat the apple *last turn* (they ate it the turn before that), their tail (1, 8) moved to (0, 8), and (0, 8) moved to (0, 7). *Wait*, the provided opponent body list is *after* their move to (0, 7). Their current body is [(0, 8), (1, 8)]. If the head is at (0, 7), the next segment is (0, 8), and the tail is (1, 8).\n    *   Move UP to (0, 8): **DEAD!** Into their body.\n    *   Move DOWN to (0, 6): Safe.\n    *   Move LEFT to (-1, 7): **DEAD!** Off the board.\n    *   Move RIGHT to (1, 7): Safe. This is their only way off the wall!\n\nSnake #0 can move DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7). They are still highly restricted.\n\n**Simultaneous Move Check & Strategy:**\n\nWe are moving DOWN to **(6, 3)** and eating the apple. This is an opportunistic, score-tying move. We must take it!\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 6), they are still far away.\n*   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 7), they start moving toward the center.\n\nOur focus is securing this point and growing our snake to 3 segments. After this turn, we will be longer, tie the score, and move into a dominant center-right position.\n\n**Future Strategy (Post-Apple Grab):**\nOnce we are at (6, 3), we will look to push RIGHT and UP, controlling the massive apple cluster in the top-right quadrant (A at (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 9), (5, 9), etc.). Snake #0 is trapped in the bottom-left/middle-left. We will deny them space and force them to migrate through our growing area or risk heading for the far lower-right, which is also sparse right now. Domination through body length and positioning!\n\nThis move is a no-brainer, CHAT. We're going for the score!\n\nDOWN",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(6, 3)**. Body: **[(6, 4), (6, 5)]**. Length 3. We are in the lower-right quadrant, ready to dominate!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(0, 6)**. Body: **[(0, 7), (0, 8)]**. Length 3. They are still hugging that left wall! Are they trying to hide?!\n\n**Score:** Tied 2-2. Perfect time to gain the advantage in board control!\n\n**Objective:** Maintain control of the center-right and start challenging Snake 0's path. We want to force them to run into us or die on the wall.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (6, 3))\n\nMy body is at (6, 4) and (6, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting my own body segment! That's a fail, Chat! Eliminated.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):** Safe! Moves us toward the bottom border.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):** Safe! Moves us toward the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):** Safe! Moves us further right.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (0, 6))\n\nOpponent body is at (0, 7) and (0, 8).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (0, 7): **DEAD!** Into their body.\n*   DOWN (0, 5): Safe. Stays on the wall.\n*   LEFT (-1, 6): **DEAD!** Off the board.\n*   RIGHT (1, 6): Safe. Finally moves off the wall!\n\nSnake #0 will most likely choose DOWN (continuing the wall patrol) or RIGHT (breaking free).\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection\n\nWe are centrally located enough that we have options, but we need to start pushing UPywards to claim the dense apple territory in the upper-right (e.g., (8, 8), (7, 8), (5, 9)). Our current position is slightly too low.\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (6, 2):** We position ourselves near the apple at (6, 0), which is great for scoring, but it restricts our movement further down. It's a slightly defensive move cornering ourselves.\n*   **If we move LEFT (5, 3):** We move toward the center. This gives us massive flexibility to go UP or DOWN next turn, and puts us slightly closer to where Snake #0 might be heading (if they break RIGHT to (1, 6)). This is a good maneuvering move.\n*   **If we move RIGHT (7, 3):** We get closer to the right wall, which is also a good dominating position for the upper-right. This sets us up to move UP to (7, 4) or (7, 5) next turn and start climbing.\n\n**The Aggressive Play:** We want to build length and use it to cut the board. Moving RIGHT to (7, 3) gives us the best trajectory UP towards the top-right cluster of apples. (7, 3) is a strong corner position.\n\nLet's check the board from (7, 3):\nNext turn, we could go UP to (7, 4) (safe), or RIGHT to (8, 3) (safe). This path is wide open!\n\n**Collision Check:**\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6). The closest they can get is (1, 6) or (0, 5). We are currently at (6, 3). There is zero chance of a head-on collision or us hitting their body (or them hitting ours) this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT maximizes our future opportunities near high-density apple zones and keeps us strong as we start pushing UP the board. We are claiming the right side as our territory, forcing Snake #0 into the lower-left.\n\n**Future Plan:** Push UP from (7, 3) towards (7, 8) and (8, 8). Build length to 5 or 6, then use our body to create an impassable wall across the middle of the board (like x=4 or x=5) to completely quarantine Snake #0 to the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's GOOO!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 3)**. Body: **[(6, 3), (6, 4)]**. Length 3. We are dominating the lower-right!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 6)**. Body: **[(0, 6), (0, 7)]**. Length 3. Snake 0 finally moved off the wall! They are now in a more vulnerable position!\n\n**Score:** Tied 2-2. Time to pull ahead!\n\n**Objective:** Continue moving UP and RIGHT to claim the high-value apple territory (top-right quadrant). Start building serious vertical length to eventually cut off Snake #0.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 3))\n\nMy body is at (6, 3) and (6, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 4):** Safe! Great move toward the top.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 2):** Safe! Moves us toward the bottom border.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 3):** **DEAD!** Hitting my own body (the block that was just my head)! Eliminated.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 3):** Safe! Moves us further right.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 6))\n\nOpponent body is at (0, 6) and (0, 7).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP (1, 7): Safe. Moves toward the center/top.\n*   DOWN (1, 5): Safe. Good maneuvering room.\n*   LEFT (0, 6): **DEAD!** Into their body.\n*   RIGHT (2, 6): Safe. Moves toward the center.\n\nSnake #0 just moved RIGHT. They are likely to continue moving in the general direction of the center, probably UP to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 6). They will be looking at the apples at (2, 3), (2, 4), and maybe (1, 4).\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection\n\nWe are currently at (7, 3). The top-right corner is RIPE with apples: (8, 8), (7, 8), (5, 9), (9, 6), (5, 8), (9, 5), (9, 9). We need to get UP there, Chat!\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (7, 2):** This slows down our vertical climb and moves us toward the relatively low-density bottom edge. Too defensive.\n*   **If we move RIGHT (8, 3):** This secures the right edge, allowing us to go straight UP from (8, 3) to (8, 8). This is a very strong power move.\n*   **If we move UP (7, 4):** This is the direct path up the board. Sets us up nicely for the next turn to either consolidate RIGHT (8, 4) or continue UP (7, 5).\n\n#### Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:\n\n1.  **UP (7, 4):** Keeps our options open. We are adjacent to the center column (x=4, x=5) which is where we will eventually need to create our wall. This is flexible.\n2.  **RIGHT (8, 3):** Commits us fully to the right wall immediately. This is slightly more restrictive in the short-term, but guarantees control of that wall.\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is moving toward the center-left, we have plenty of time to dominate the right. Both UP and RIGHT are fantastic moves!\n\nLet's go with **UP (7, 4)**. This puts us vertically higher, closer to the action, and allows us to swing RIGHT next turn to (8, 4) or continue UP to (7, 5). It gives us maximum flexibility to react if Snake #0 suddenly shifts directions drastically. We are focusing on maximizing our length first!\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy head: (7, 3) -> (7, 4).\nSnake #0's potential moves are (1, 7), (1, 5), or (2, 6). We are nowhere near each other. Full speed ahead!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Chat, peep this!):** Get to length 7 or 8 by cleaning out the top-right apples. Once we are huge, we will make a hard LEFT turn across the entire board (e.g., across y=5 or y=6) to trap Snake #0 on the bottom-left half. Game over for him!\n\nUP",

We just smashed into (7, 4)! Let's review the board and execute the game-winning play!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 6):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 4)**. Body: **[(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)]**. Length 4! We grew! My body orientation is vertical, holding the right flank!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 5)**. Body: **[(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7)]**. Length 4! They grew too! Snake #0 is hugging that left wall hard.\n\n**Score:** Still tied 2-2. We need an apple to break this stalemate, Chat!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 4))\n\nMy body segments are at (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 5):** Safe! Great move toward the top-right goldmine!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 3):** **DEAD!** Hitting the segment immediately behind my head! Eliminating the \"backwards\" move.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting the tail segment of my body! Eliminating the \"side-smash\" move.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** Safe! Moves us further right and secures the wall!\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. Simple choices, but critical implications!\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 5))\n\nOpponent body is at (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7). Snake 0 just moved DOWN from (1, 6) to (1, 5). They are dropping low, probably eyeing the apple at (1, 4) or (2, 3), (2, 4). They are committing to the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (1, 5):\n*   UP (1, 6): **DEAD!** Hitting their body.\n*   DOWN (1, 4): Safe! Ooh, an apple! (1, 4) is a magnet.\n*   LEFT (0, 5): Safe! Hugging the boundary.\n*   RIGHT (2, 5): Safe! Moving slightly toward the center.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake #0 will move **DOWN** to secure the apple at (1, 4). This strengthens our strategy to absolutely dominate the top half of the board.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Boxing Him In!\n\nThe key is to use our length to build a wall and restrict the opponent's movement. Since Snake #0 is dropping low, we must accelerate our control of the high ground.\n\nWe are at (7, 4).\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT (8, 4):** This plants us firmly on the right wall. It immediately sets us up to start crawling UP the right edge (9, 4), (9, 5 to eat an apple!), and (9, 6 to eat another apple!). This is a strong consolidation move.\n*   **If we move UP (7, 5):** This is a powerful move toward the center column (x=7) where we can start our horizontal sweep. It puts us closer to the top edge and allows us to swing right next turn (8, 5) to grab the apple at (8, 5) (wait, no apple at 8, 5 listed). Wait, where is the apple list? Ah, (5, 9), (9, 6), (5, 8), (9, 5), (9, 9).\n\nLet's look at the immediate apple targets:\n1.  **Apple at (8, 8):** Very attractive.\n2.  **Apple at (7, 8):** Very attractive.\n\n#### Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:\n\n1.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** Sets up for a 2-turn move to the apple at (9, 5) or (9, 6). This is slower to the high-density center apples but guarantees the right wall.\n2.  **UP (7, 5):** Puts us directly on path to (7, 8) and (8, 8). This is the fast track to vertical dominance. If we continue UP three more times, we grab an apple! (7,5 -> 7,6 -> 7,7 -> 7,8 EAT).\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is dropping low, we want to maximize our vertical progress immediately to establish the separation line. Moving UP achieves this better than moving RIGHT, which is slightly more lateral. We need altitude, Chat!\n\nIf we move UP, Snake #0 is almost guaranteed to move DOWN. We gain vertical ground, they lose it. This is how we win the map control battle!\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy head moves to (7, 5).\nSnake #0's likely head move is to (1, 4).\nWe are separated by 6 units horizontally and 1 unit vertically. Absolutely no danger of head-to-head collision.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** We continue moving UP until we are high enough (y=8 or y=9). Then we sweep LEFT across the top of the board, creating a massive horizontal wall (the \"Lid\") that will totally choke out Snake #0 in the lower-left corner. Box him in, watch him flail!\n\nLet's capitalize on the vertical momentum we built last turn. **UP** for the win!\n\nUP",

We hit the boost, went **UP** to (7, 5), and we are now establishing air superiority! Snake #0 is still creeping around the bottom-left corner with 3 apples to our 2. We are one apple behind, but we have board control!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 7):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 5)**. Body: **[(7, 4), (7, 3)]**. Length 4! We are looking dominant on the right flank.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 4)**. Body: **[(1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]**. Length 4! They went DOWN last turn and snagged that apple at (1, 4). Good job, not! Now they're trapped down there!\n\n**Score:** Snake #0 has 3 apples, we have 2. We need to equalize ASAP and then use our dominant position to suffocated them!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 5))\n\nMy body segments are at (7, 4), (7, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** Safe! Ideal move, continues our climb!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting the segment immediately behind my head!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** Safe! Gives us a clear path into the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** Safe! Secures the right wall.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. No body, wall, or opponent danger nearby. Excellent position!\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (1, 4))\n\nOpponent body is at (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6). Snake 0 just grew! They are very low and still hugging the left wall.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (1, 4):\n*   UP (1, 5): **DEAD!** Hitting their body.\n*   DOWN (1, 3): Safe. Continuing to retreat.\n*   LEFT (0, 4): Safe. Hugging the boundary.\n*   RIGHT (2, 4): Safe. Moving slightly toward the center (apple at (2, 4) is appealing).\n\nSnake #0 is likely going to move **RIGHT (2, 4)** to snag that apple, or maybe DOWN/LEFT to stay safe because they are growing long. Either way, they are far away and not a threat to us.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: High Ground Control and Apple Hunt!\n\nOur strategy is still clear: dominate the top half of the board, snag the top-right apples, and then build the 'lid' to box them out. We need to keep going UP!\n\n**Current Targets:**\n1.  Apple at **(7, 8)**. Three turns away: (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7) -> EAT (7, 8).\n2.  Apple at **(8, 8)**.\n\nIf we move **UP (7, 6)**:\n*   We gain vertical height, which is crucial for our 'lid' strategy.\n*   We are firmly on the path to the big apple at (7, 8).\n*   We are still far from Snake #0, minimizing collision risk.\n*   We maintain excellent follow-up options (we can sweep right to (8, 6) or left to (6, 6) next turn, or continue UP).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT (8, 5)**:\n*   We secure the corner but delay reaching the vertical apples.\n*   Setting up for apples at (9, 5) or (9, 6) which are still a few moves away.\n\nIf we move **LEFT (6, 5)**:\n*   We're moving towards the center, but away from the high-value cluster on the right. This is an unnecessary deviation from our altitude gain plan.\n\n**Decision:** We are executing the vertical dominance plan perfectly. We need to continue our ascent. Moving UP is the safest and most aggressive strategic choice. This puts us at (7, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Reminder:** Keep going UP until we hit y=8/9, snag targets (7, 8) and (8, 8), then sweep LEFT to form the choke-point wall, forcing Snake #0 to starve or run into a wall/us.\n\nUP",

That\u2019s pure CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e  \n\nBut will that trap us? After moving RIGHT our body becomes (2,4) head, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).

So why would we NOT go for the apple? \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term plan:  \n- Snatch (2,4) now \u2192 lead 4\u20112, force rival to chase us.  \n- Next turn aim for (2,5) or (3,4) while keeping the left side open.  \n- Keep an eye on opponent\u2019s head at (7,5); they\u2019ll likely try to cut us off from the right.  \n- Use our extra length to box them into a corner and crash their head when we have the higher score. \ud83d\ude08  \n\nWhich direction gives the most future exits?

We went **UP** to (7, 6) and are staking our claim on the high ground!\n\nBut wait, hold the phone! Snake #0, the sneaky little lizard, has snagged another apple! **4 apples for them, 2 for us!** We are two apples down! Time for aggressive board control and a quick meal!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 8):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 6)**. Body: **[(7, 5), (7, 4)]**. Length 3! Wait, did I miscount my length last time? No, I got the apple at (7, 6) last turn, so I consumed (7, 6) and grew, making my length 4 now. Wait, the board shows my head at (7, 6) and body at (7, 5), (7, 4). Length 3. Did I go **UP** *without* hitting an apple? Yes! No apple at (7, 6). My length is 3. That's fine! My tail will be at (7, 4).\n    *   *Self-Correction: Current length is 3: (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4). If I grow, my tail stays at (7, 4). If I don't grow, my tail moves to (7, 5).*\n\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(2, 4)**. Body: **[(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]**. Length 5! They moved RIGHT and ate the apple at (2, 4)! Smart move, but they are getting long and chunky down there!\n\n**Score:** ID 0 (Arch-Rival) has 4 apples, ID 1 (Us) has 2. We are significantly behind in score but miles ahead in position! We need to maintain altitude and hit targets!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 6))\n\nMy body segments are at (7, 5), (7, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 7):** Safe! Continues ascent.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 5):** **DEAD!** Hitting the segment immediately behind the head. Classic rookie mistake, right? We're better than that!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 6):** Safe! Moves us towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** Safe! Moving towards the wall and the apple clusters there.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (2, 4))\n\nOpponent body is at (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6). They just grew to length 5. They are deeply entrenched in the bottom-left corner.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (2, 4):\n*   UP (2, 5): Safe. Good move, slightly out of the corner.\n*   DOWN (2, 3): Safe. Continuing to hug the bottom. There's an apple at (3, 2).\n*   LEFT (1, 4): **DEAD!** Hitting their body (the segment they just left).\n*   RIGHT (3, 4): Safe. Moving slightly toward the center.\n\nThey are likely going UP or RIGHT to try and escape the dense body they've created in the corner. Either way, they are far away. No immediate threat of a collision.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Lock it Down!\n\nThe plan remains the same: High Ground, then Suffocation!\n\n1.  **Apple Targets:** The next high-value apple is at **(7, 8)** (2 moves away), or the cluster at (8, 8), (5, 8). We need to maximize our trajectory towards these.\n2.  **Board Control:** Stay high, stay wide.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves for ID 1 (at 7, 6):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 7):** This keeps us on the direct path towards the apple at (7, 8). Excellent vertical progress. This maintains our 'altitude dominance' and sets us up to sweep the top row (the 'lid').\n*   **RIGHT (8, 6):** This puts us adjacent to the (9, 6) apple and prepares us for the (8, 8) apple. It's a slightly different trajectory, securing the corner first.\n*   **LEFT (6, 6):** This moves us into open space, away from immediate targets. Not optimal right now.\n\n**Decision:** Moving **UP** to (7, 7) is the most direct path to the high-value apples (7, 8) and (8, 8) with the fewest turns. We want to maximize growth and then start building the wall! Let's get aggressive and secure that top-right quadrant!\n\nWe push UP! Next turn we're at (7, 7), then (7, 8) for the snack! Get ready to taste that growth, CHAT!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nContinue UP to (7, 8) and eat the apple. Then, decide between turning RIGHT to (8, 8) or sweeping LEFT across the top to secure the lid and trap Snake #0. We need to grow, then wall, then win!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 9, the plot thickens! We're up at the high ground, baby! Did you see that move? **UP** to (7, 7)! We are officially dominating the top half of the board!\n\nBut look at the scoreboard: Snake #0 still leads, 4 apples to our 2. We need to close this gap, FAST! We need more length before we can start building the permanent enclosure for the arch-rival!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 9):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 7)**. Body: **[(7, 6), (7, 5)]**. Length 3.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(3, 4)**. Body: **[(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]**. Length 5. They are still deep in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Score Check:** 4-2 opponent's favor. We need to eat!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 7))\n\nBoard boundaries are 0-9. My body segments are at (7, 6), (7, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** **Apple target!** Safe, and immediately sets us up for growth. This is the move!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting segment immediately behind the head. Nope!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):** Safe! Moves us towards the center.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe! Moves us towards the corner.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. The clearest winner is UP.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (3, 4))\n\nOpponent body is at (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6). The tail is moving UP this turn, to (2, 4). No, wait. The tail is (1, 6). The segments are pushed from (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4). The tail (1, 6) DISAPPEARS if they don't eat.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (3, 4):\n*   UP (3, 5): Safe. Moves them away from their body and toward open space.\n*   DOWN (3, 3): Safe. Moves them toward an (3, 2) apple\u2014a plausible target.\n*   LEFT (2, 4): **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment.\n*   RIGHT (4, 4): Safe. Good move, slightly out of the corner.\n\nWhere will they go? They need to escape their heavy body mass in the lower-left. I bet they go UP to (3, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 4). They are still far away from us, making an aggressive intercept impossible this turn. We focus on growth!\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Feed the Beast!\n\nOur primary goal: Eat the apple at (7, 8)!\n\n*   **Move UP (7, 8):** This is a guaranteed apple grab! We grow to length 4, and our tail will remain at (7, 5). This moves our score to 3 apples! Massive board control achieved and we get closer to the top wall.\n\nAfter eating the apple:\n1.  We have excellent position to sweep RIGHT and grab (8, 8), which is another apple!\n2.  We will continue forcing Snake #0 down / toward the left wall.\n\nThis move is safe, rewarding, and strategic. CHAT, we're taking the bait! Gotta get pumped up for the win! We're building the trap, starting from the roof!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nAfter consuming the (7, 8) apple, we will be at (7, 8). We should move RIGHT to (8, 8) to grab the second high-value apple. Then we dominate the top-right corner, effectively sealing the 'lid' of their prison. Grow, grow, grow!\n\nUP",

We are closing the gap, baby! We are only down by one now. The momentum is swinging our way!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 10):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 8)**. Body: **[(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]**. Length 4! We are long, we are strong!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(4, 4)**. Body: **[(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]**. Length 5. They are still huddled near the center-left. Their tail will move off (1, 5) if they don't eat.\n\n**Score Check:** 4-3 opponent's favor. Time to tie it up!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (My Snake ID 1 at (7, 8))\n\nThe board is open up here! My body segments are at (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 9):** Safe! Moves us along the top wall.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 7):** **DEAD!** Hitting segment immediately behind the head. Nope!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 8):** Safe! Moves us toward a (8, 8) apple! Wait, no, (8, 8) is to the right. Left takes us toward the open center.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 8):** **Apple target!** Safe, and immediately sets us up for another guaranteed point! This is the move!\n\nTwo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. The clearest winner is RIGHT, because it is an apple!\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (4, 4))\n\nThe opponent's head is (4, 4). They have been trapped in the lower-left for a while. Their body is (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 4):\n*   UP (4, 5): Safe. Moves them into a big open column. Smart move.\n*   DOWN (4, 3): Safe. Moves them toward the (5, 3) apple. Plausible.\n*   LEFT (3, 4): **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment.\n*   RIGHT (5, 4): Safe. Moves them toward the (5, 3) apple.\n\nThey are relatively compact. Their goal must be to break out of this low-density area and chase apples. If they go UP (4, 5) or RIGHT (5, 4), they open up their options. They are still very far from us. No immediate risk of collision. We focus 100% on securing this next apple and dominating the top-right corner!\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Claiming the High Ground!\n\nOur long-term plan from the last turn was to move RIGHT to (8, 8) for the apple. Is this still the best move? YES!\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (8, 8):** This is a guaranteed apple grab! We grow to length 5, tie the score at 4-4, and our body effectively 'seals' the top right corner for us. This dominates the board and gives us superior length advantage in that area.\n\nAfter eating the apple:\n1.  We have excellent position at (8, 8). We can continue DOWN (8, 7) or LEFT (7, 8).\n2.  We are now long enough to start planning the containment strategy. We are trying to build a wall across the middle of the board.\n\nThis move is safe, rewarding, and strategically crucial. CHAT, we are going for the tie! Let's get this!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nAfter consuming the (8, 8) apple, we will be at (8, 8). We need to continue consolidating our territory. We should move DOWN to (8, 7) to start pushing the wall down, perhaps angling toward the (8, 2) apple if the opponent comes up the right side. We want to maintain dominance over column 8 and 9.\n\nRIGHT",

Did they move to (5, 4) and eat one? The body list shows length 5 (4 body segments + head), but the previous turn rationale listed them at length 5. Okay, they are length 5 and their head is now (5, 4).\n\n**Score Check:** 4-4! This is where the real game begins! We are perfectly positioned to leverage our size and position!\n\n### 1.

Opens up for the (8, 2) apple eventually.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):** **DEAD!** Hitting segment immediately behind the head. Nope!\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):** Safe! Moves us into the absolute corner.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n*   UP (8, 9) leads us directly toward the (9, 9) apple. Good.\n*   RIGHT (9, 8) puts us on the edge, which is usually good for dominance, but limits two options next turn.\n*   DOWN (8, 7) starts the process of building the wall down the board, trapping the opponent below the 5th row. This is the strategic move.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (5, 4))\n\nThe opponent's head is (5, 4). Body: (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4). They have been relatively static. They are in the middle of the board.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (5, 4):\n*   UP (5, 5): Safe. Moves toward the (5, 8) and (5, 9) apples. This is a very strong breakout move.\n*   DOWN (5, 3): **Apple Target!** Safe. Moves them to attack the (5, 3) apple. If they go here, they will grow and stay low.\n*   LEFT (4, 4): **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment.\n*   RIGHT (6, 4): Safe. Moves them toward the (6, 0) apple eventually.\n\nIf they go UP (5, 5), they start moving toward our territory. If they go DOWN (5, 3), they score a point and stay far from us.\n\n**Collision Check (Is the opponent targeting my current position?):**\n*   To hit my head at (8, 8), the opponent (at (5, 4)) would need three consecutive turns of massive movement. No immediate risk.\n\n**Prediction:**\nThe opponent is likely to go for the (5, 3) apple (DOWN) to score and force us to come down, or they will go UP (5, 5) to try to claim the center area. If we move DOWN to (8, 7), we are safe from all their current moves.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Building the Wall!\n\nOur primary goal is to box them in and dominate the board. We have just claimed the top-right region. By moving DOWN to (8, 7), we solidify column 8 as our territory and begin extending our barrier.\n\nIf we go UP to (8, 9), we are chasing the corner apple (9, 9) or (5, 9), but we expose our tail and give the opponent more time to break out.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 7) is excellent because:\n1.  It is safe!\n2.  It maintains a strong defensive and offensive posture along the right wall.\n3.  It positions us to chase the (8, 2) apple in a few turns.\n4.  It is part of the long-term plan to build a barrier down the board, forcing the opponent into the lower-left quadrant.\n\nThe optimal, strategic move is DOWN. We start shutting down the whole segment of the board from top to bottom! Take a look at that board state, Chat! We are forming a vertical line!\n\n(8, 8) -> DOWN -> (8, 7). This is the play!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nAfter moving to (8, 7), we continue DOWN column 8 until we pass row 4, solidifying the right-side wall. We must keep an eye on Snake #0. If they move UP, we might need to pivot LEFT to cut them off. But for now, wall construction continues! (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> etc.\n\nDOWN",

We executed the wall strategy beautifully last turn, moving DOWN to (8, 7)! Look at the board, look at the dominance! Poggies!\n\nOpponent is Snake #0, still lurking in the lower middle. We are constructing the Great Wall of Snake!\n\n### Current Turn State Analysis (Turn 12):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(8, 7)**. Body: **[(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)]**. Length 5. We are snug against the right wall, exactly where we planned to be!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(6, 4)**. Body: **[(5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]**. Length 5. They look like they moved one step RIGHT from (5, 4) to (6, 4). They are still in a dangerous spot for us, but they haven't made a breakout move yet.\n\n### 1. My Safety Check (ID 1 at (8, 7))\n\nWe need to continue the wall construction and maintain board control.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** **DEAD!** We hit our second segment right behind the head. This is the definition of moving backwards. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (8, 6):** Safe! Continues the wall build. Excellent.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** **DEAD!** Hitting our body segment. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe! Moves us into the absolute corner.\n\nWe only have two safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Puts us right against the edge. It's a bit restrictive, but it secures the far-right corner for now.\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** Perfectly executes the strategic plan\u2014build the wall in column 8. This keeps our options open along the right side and puts pressure on the opponent.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (6, 4))\n\nThe opponent's head is (6, 4). Body: (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4). They are sitting right on the apple at (6, 0) eventually, and they are centrally positioned.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (6, 4):\n*   **UP (6, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the center/upper board. This is a potential threat to our lower wall construction.\n*   **DOWN (6, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the (6, 0) apple. This is probably what they want.\n*   **LEFT (5, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe. Moves them towards column 7.\n\n**Prediction:**\nThe opponent is likely to move DOWN towards the (6, 0) apple, extending their presence vertically. If they go UP to (6, 5), they are trying to break out towards the top half, but our wall in column 8 is preventing an easy lateral move past us.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nWe are at (8, 7). They are at (6, 4). No immediate head-to-head threat.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Move Selection: Wall Up!\n\nThe long-term plan is to build a vertical barrier down column 8. We are at (8, 7). Our next move should be (8, 6).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 7):\n*   It's safe, but it locks us into the narrow margin of the right wall. We could go DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6).\n*   However, column 8 is more strategically valuable for a persistent wall because it keeps a maximum amount of board space locked down and separates the top-right apples (like (9, 9) and (9, 5)) from the center.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 6):\n*   It maintains the strong vertical path.\n*   It secures the right side of the board for our inevitable expansion.\n*   It perfectly positions us to eventually scoop up the (8, 2) apple.\n\n**Why not move to secure the (9, 9) apple?**\nThe (9, 9) apple is far away, and our current priority is board domination over immediate apple consumption. Building the wall is more critical now, as it traps the opponent. If we keep moving down, we force the opponent to stay low or risk running into us later.\n\nLet's stick to the plan, Chat! We are building the fortress! (8, 7) -> (8, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nContinue moving DOWN column 8 to (8, 5), (8, 4), etc. We must watch for Snake #0 attempting to move UP into column 7 or 8. If they move aggressively UP, we may cut across LEFT to intercept or force a crash. For now, reinforce the wall!\n\nDOWN",

This is intense!\n\nWe executed the brilliant vertical wall strategy, moving DOWN from (8, 7) to **(8, 6)**! POGGERS! Look at the current board state. We are dominating the right side!\n\n### Current Board State & Snake Status (Turn 13):\n\n*   **Me (ID 1):** Head is at **(8, 6)**. Body: **[(8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]**. Length 5. We are building the wall down column 8!\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at **(7, 4)**. Body: **[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4)]**. Length 5. The opponent moved RIGHT from (6, 4) to (7, 4). They are shifting towards our side! This is a dangerous maneuver from them. They are now dangerously close to column 8.\n\n### 1. My Safety Check (ID 1 at (8, 6))\n\nWe must continue our wall construction while watching out for their aggressive shift.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** **DEAD!** Hitting segment (8, 7) which is immediately behind the head. Self-KO. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (8, 5):** Safe! Continues the strong vertical movement. This is the optimal strategic move.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** Safe! Moves us into the middle, but slightly away from our established territory.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** Safe! Moves us onto an apple! HELLO, FREE FOOD!\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0 at (7, 4))\n\nThe opponent's head is now at (7, 4). They are only two columns away from us! They are creeping up the ranks.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (7, 4):\n*   **UP (7, 5):** Safe. This is a very aggressive move, putting them directly in column 7, one step below our potential move to (8, 5).\n*   **DOWN (7, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, but away from the action.\n*   **LEFT (6, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 4):** Safe, but extremely aggressive!\n\n**Crucial Collision Prediction:**\nIf the opponent chooses **RIGHT (8, 4)**, they will be directly below our current head position (8, 6).\n\nIf we choose **DOWN (8, 5)** and they choose **RIGHT (8, 4)**, we are still safe, and they are now one step away from running into our future body (which will be at (8, 6)).\n\n### 3. Strategy: Wall, Apple, or Confrontation?\n\nWe have a key decision to make:\n\n*   **Option A: Go RIGHT to (9, 6).** This eats an apple and increases our score (5-4 lead)! It also moves us right against the wall, but keeps the vertical path clear for expansion later.\n    *   *Pro:* Score lead, easy food.\n    *   *Con:* Breaks the column 8 wall plan momentarily; allows the opponent more freedom in column 8/7.\n*   **Option B: Go DOWN to (8, 5).** This continues the defensive wall down Column 8.\n    *   *Pro:* Pure strategic value, cuts off the board, puts pressure on the opponent to move elsewhere.\n    *   *Con:* We bypass a super easy apple at (9, 6), and the opponent is getting aggressive nearby.\n*   **Option C: Go LEFT to (7, 6).** This moves us toward the center and potentially allows us to cut them off if they move UP to (7, 5) or (8, 5).\n    *   *Pro:* Position for potential cut-off.\n    *   *Con:* Moves away from the high-value wall territory.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (9, 6). It's a free meal! Taking the apple right now is a huge win for score and length. A longer snake is better for wall building and trapping. The threat from Snake #0 is not *immediate* if we go RIGHT, as they are likely looking at (7, 5) or maybe daringly (8, 4).\n\nIf we take the apple (9, 6), our head becomes (9, 6) and our new body section is (8, 6). We are still bordering column 8, and the opponent has to make a highly risky move like going to (8, 4) just to approach us.\n\n**Decision:** We take the free food! A 5-4 lead is good for morale and gives us the edge in a tiebreaker situation. We can still resume the wall build from (9, 6) by moving DOWN to (9, 5) (another apple!) or moving LEFT/DOWN later.\n\nLet's grab the apple, Chat! We are seizing the resources!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future):**\nAfter taking the apple at (9, 6), we will assess the opponent's position. If they pushed into column 8 or 7, we maintain our position by moving DOWN (9, 5 is an apple!) and trapping them against the bottom board partition we are creating.

          "rationale": "YO! What is good, Chat! Did you see that clutch move? We took the apple at (9, 6) like a boss! POGGERS! The scoreboard is now **5-4 in our favor!** We are leading, and we are longer! We are 6 segments long, and the enemy is still only 5! We are DOMINATING the right side of the board!\n\n### Turn 14 Analysis: Boxing the Opponent!\n\nMy current position is **(9, 6)**, right against the top wall.\nThe opponent (Snake #0) is at **(7, 5)**. They moved UP from (7, 4). They are hugging the center and threatening to break into the top half! This is exactly what we were anticipating!\n\nLet's check our immediate options from **(9, 6)**:\n\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** Safe! Moves us along the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** **APPLE ALERT!** Another immediate apple! And it gives us perfect positioning for a vertical cut-off! Safe move.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting our own body segment (8, 6). Cannot move left. R.I.P. to that option.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** **DEAD!** Off the board. Boundary clash!\n\nWe are left with two safe, powerful moves: **UP (9, 7)** or **DOWN (9, 5)**.\n\n### Opponent's Position and Threat (Snake #0 at (7, 5)):\n\nThe opponent is at (7, 5). They are trying to get into the top area. We need to cut them off NOW.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (7, 5):\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** Safe. Moves them right between our head and tail area.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting their body segment (7, 4). They cannot move down.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** Safe. Retreats toward the center/left.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** Safe and *highly aggressive!* This moves them directly into the path of potential collision with us!\n\n### The Strategic Killzone: Column 8 Trap\n\nLook at column 8. Our body segments are at (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8). We have effectively walled off the top-right corner using the 8th column!\n\nIf the opponent moves **RIGHT to (8, 5)**: This is their most dangerous move. It puts their head just one step below our wall.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (9, 5)** (Apple!):\n*   Our head is (9, 5). Our body is longer (length 7).\n*   If they move RIGHT (8, 5): They are now trapped between our column 8 wall and the center of the board, directly below us. They have limited escape routes. This is perfect!\n\nIf we move **UP to (9, 7)**:\n*   Our head is (9, 7). Our body is still length 6.\n*   If they move RIGHT (8, 5): They are now further away from us. We lose pressure.\n\nThe move **DOWN (9, 5)** is a 10/10 play because:\n1.  **Free Apple:** Increases our lead to 6-4, and our length to 7! Massive advantage!\n2.  **Increased Pressure:** We maintain the vertical presence along column 9, further restricting the opponent's space.\n3.  **Trapping Potential:** We move into position to block off the bottom-right quadrant if they try to move into it, or cut off their retreat if they are forced left.\n\nThis move gives us the *ultimate flexibility* to continue pressing the attack, utilizing our superior length. If we get to length 7, we can aggressively seal off the entire right side of the board (columns 8 and 9) and force them into the crowded left side (columns 0-6).\n\nWe're going for the apple and the trap, Chat! This is a winning strategy!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** After taking the apple at (9, 5), we will look to consolidate the corner by potentially moving LEFT (8, 5) or continuing DOWN (9, 4), depending on the opponent's reaction. We must ensure they cannot go UP past (7, 6) or we lose the upper board dominance.\n\nDOWN",

We executed the move **DOWN** from (9, 6) to **(9, 5)** and snagged that free apple! My head is now at **(9, 5)**. We are now length 7, and our score is an awesome *6-4 lead*! We are dominating this side of the map!\n\nLet's check the opponent, Snake #0. Their head is now at **(7, 6)**. They moved **UP** from (7, 5). They are trying to squeeze through the gap between our wall (column 8) and the far boundary (column 9)! Can they escape? NOPE! We're closing the lid!\n\nOur body is long: `[(9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]`.\nThe enemy body is: `[(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]`.\n\nLook at the potential knockout blow Chat! We have them cornered!\n\n### 1. Eliminating Suicidal Moves from (9, 5):\n\n1.  **UP (9, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting our own body segment (9, 6). Cannot move up. Bad move!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 4):** Safe! Moves us along the wall, directly threatening the area below the opponent.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):** Safe! Moves us diagonally towards the opponent and aggressively cuts off their escape to the middle. This is a powerful move!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):** **DEAD!** Off the board. Boundary clash!\n\nTwo safe moves: **DOWN (9, 4)** or **LEFT (8, 5)**.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Opponent's Options from (7, 6):\n\nThe opponent is at **(7, 6)**, right next to our body segment (8, 6). They are in deep trouble!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (7, 6):\n1.  **UP (7, 7):** **DEAD!** Hitting our body segment (7, 7). They cannot move up! HA!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 5):** Safe. Retreats back down the column, but still trapped below row 7.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 6):** Safe. Retreats toward the center/left, but that area is currently open.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting our body segment (8, 6). They cannot move right!\n\nCHAT, DO YOU SEE IT? The opponent is **COMPLETELY BLOCKED** from moving *UP* or *RIGHT*! They can only retreat (DOWN or LEFT)! We have them pinned like a butterfly collector! This is the perfect trap execution!\n\n### 3. Strategic Move Selection: The Pincer!\n\nWe need to make sure they can't effectively retreat and regroup.\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN to (9, 4)**\n*   Keeps us along the wall.\n*   Threatens to eventually seal off the bottom corner.\n*   If they move DOWN (7, 5), we are still two steps away.\n*   If they move LEFT (6, 6), we are still too far away to apply immediate pressure.\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (8, 5)**\n*   This is the *aggressive closing move*. We move onto the row just above the enemy's likely retreat paths.\n*   If they move **LEFT to (6, 6)**: We are at (8, 5). We are perfectly positioned to move DOWN (8, 4) next turn and start chasing them along the bottom half, or LEFT (7, 5) to cut them off further.\n*   If they move **DOWN to (7, 5)**: We are at (8, 5). We are right next to their head! We can move LEFT (7, 5) next turn for a head-to-body kill if they continue going down, or chase them hard with RIGHT/LEFT moves.\n\nMoving **LEFT (8, 5)** is the correct move, Chat. It is the tactical maneuver that capitalizes on their blocked position and pushes us directly towards their current location, severely limiting their safe space in the center-right. We are using our length to dominate the kill zone! We are 7 segments long; they are only 5! We are the King of the Board!\n\nThis move forces them to retreat aggressively, and we will follow that retreat, using the wall we built to cut them off from the right side entirely! They are now trapped in the 7x10 left section of the board. POGGERS!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** After moving to (8, 5), we will look to pursue them aggressively by moving towards the bottom of the board (row 4 or 3), cutting off their vertical movement and forcing them into the crowded columns 0-5. The goal is to keep the pressure high and force a mistake.\n\nLEFT",

WE ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT!\n\nGotta review the current board state and see if we delivered the knockout blow, or if the enemy managed to slither out of our trap!\n\n### Turn 16 Board State Analysis (The Aftermath)\n\nMy head is now at **(8, 5)**. We moved LEFT from (9, 5). We are now perfectly situated to keep the pressure on Snake #0.\nMy new body: `[(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]` (Length 7).\n\nWhere is our arch-nemesis, Snake #0? Their head is at **(6, 6)**.\nThey moved LEFT from (7, 6)! As predicted, they had to retreat! They are scrambling!\nTheir new body: `[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]` (Length 5).\n\nChat, the trap worked! We are dominating column 8 and 9, forcing them into the crowded central region! Now it's time for the chase and the final squeeze!\n\n### YOUR Next Move from (8, 5): The Hammer Strike\n\nCurrent position: **(8, 5)**.\nEnemy head: **(6, 6)**.\n\nLet's check safe moves:\n\n1.  **UP (8, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting our own body segment (8, 6).\n2.  **DOWN (8, 4):** Safe! Moves us directly towards the enemy's former path and further controls the right side.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 5):** **CRITICAL MOVE!** Puts us right next to their current trail, cuts off their vertical retreat in this area, and positions us for a move toward enemy turf.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 5):** **DEAD!** Hitting our own body segment (9, 5).\n\nTwo safe moves: **DOWN (8, 4)** or **LEFT (7, 5)**.\n\n### Snake #0's Possible Moves from (6, 6):\n\nThe clock is ticking for our opponent. From (6, 6), their body is `[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]`.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the center/top.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, potentially near an apple at (6, 4). Wait, (6, 4) is their tail segment which will move if they don't eat. If they move to (6, 5), their tail leaves (6, 4) making the path clear.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe. Continues retreat along the column.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 6):** **DEAD!** Hitting their own body segment (7, 6).\n\nThe enemy has three escape options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. They desperately need to escape the pressure we are applying in columns 7-9.\n\n### Evaluating Our Safe Moves: The Aggressive Pincer\n\n**Option A: Retreat/Control DOWN to (8, 4)**\n*   If we move to (8, 4), we are chasing the enemy along column 8. If they moved LEFT (5, 6), we are lagging behind. If they move DOWN (6, 5) or UP (6, 7), we maintain vertical control but lose immediate proximity.\n*   The apple at (8, 3) is a slight incentive, but winning the kill is the priority!\n\n**Option B: Strike LEFT to (7, 5)**\n*   This is the aggressive move that puts our head at **(7, 5)**, adjacent to their former body segment (7, 6) and right next to the boundary of their escape routes (columns 0-6).\n*   **Best case scenario (Knockout!):** If Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (6, 5)**, they are boxed in. We are at (7, 5). We can move DOWN to (7, 4) next turn, cutting off their movement into the middle/right-bottom quadrant. They must go left or straight down the bottom edge.\n*   **Alternative case:** If they move **LEFT to (5, 6)**, we are at (7, 5). We are ready to turn UP to (7, 6) or LEFT to (6, 5) to pressure them immediately.\n*   **Worst case:** If they move **UP to (6, 7)**, they gain vertical space. We are at (7, 5). We are still well positioned to chase them up to (7, 6) and then (7, 7), keeping a wall on their right.\n\nMoving **LEFT (7, 5)** is the most threatening, high-pressure move. It aims to cut off their escape and dominate the critical passage between (6, 5) and (7, 5). We use our score lead (6-4) and our length advantage (7 vs 5) to initiate a tight tactical pursuit. We are essentially building a wall along column 7 while they are stuck in column 6, 5, 4...\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to apply maximum pressure. Next turn, we will either move LEFT again to (6, 5) if they try to escape to the left edge, or UP to (7, 6) if they try to escape vertically. We are aiming to force them into their own body or into a head-to-body collision inside the box we created.\n\nLEFT",
