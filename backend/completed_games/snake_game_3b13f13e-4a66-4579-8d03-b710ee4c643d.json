Board is wide open, but we gotta set the tone EARLY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (0,9) \u2013 currently an apple 'A' and empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) \u2013 off board! \u274c DEAD.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (1,9). They can go UP (off board \u274c), DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9). Their safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. They might go for apple at (0,9) or (3,9) or (0,2)? But they're far from many apples.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If we go RIGHT to (1,8), enemy could go DOWN to (1,8) same turn \u2192 double KO. Both die instantly. We have same score (0 apples), so tie \u2192 draw? Not ideal. We want to dominate, not tie. So maybe avoid RIGHT unless we think they won't go DOWN.\n\nIf we go UP to (0,9), enemy could go LEFT to (0,9) \u2192 double KO. Also risky.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (0,7), enemy can't reach us this turn (their DOWN is (1,8)). Safest from head-on.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to control center, force enemy into edges. Right now, apples are clustered around col 0-6, rows 2-8. We should move toward center (like (4,4) area) to cut off enemy's access. Enemy is top-right corner; we can push them against wall.\n\n**THIS TURN:** \n- UP (0,9): gets apple, grows to length 2, but risk head-on if enemy goes LEFT.\n- DOWN (0,7): safe, no apple, keeps options open.\n- RIGHT (1,8): no apple, risk head-on.\n\nI think we play SAFE first turn, avoid early double KO. Let enemy maybe take an apple first? But we want to be aggressive... Hmm.\n\nActually, if we go DOWN to (0,7), we set up to go further down toward apple at (0,2) next turn. Enemy likely goes for (0,9) apple? If they take it, they grow, but we can trap them in corner later.\n\n**DECISION:** Let's take the safe move, avoid collision chance entirely. Go DOWN, then next turn we can go DOWN again toward apple at (0,2) or move right toward center.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** Move toward (0,2) apple or cut off enemy's path down from top. Watch if enemy grows.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is top-right corner (2,9). We can move toward center and up to threaten boxing them against top wall. Apples at (0,9), (3,9), (4,8) etc. are near enemy. If they grab one, they grow and become harder to trap. We should move UP to contest that area and maybe force them into a corner early.\n\n**APPLE CONSIDERATION:** UP to (0,8) gets us closer to apple at (0,9) next turn. DOWN to (0,6) gets us closer to apple at (0,2). RIGHT to (1,7) moves toward center. I think UP is aggressive \u2014 we push toward enemy's starting zone, claim top-left edge, and threaten to cut off their descent.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLANNING:** If we go UP to (0,8), next turn we can go UP to (0,9) for apple, or RIGHT to (1,8) to advance toward enemy. Enemy might go for (3,9) or (0,9) apple. We can potentially intercept.\n\n**DECISION:** Let's be AGGRESSIVE! Move UP toward enemy and top-row apples. Force them to react.

Gotta close that gap and get aggressive!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (0,9) \u2013 apple! \ud83c\udf4e No snake there. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) \u2013 off board \u274c DEAD.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) \u2013 empty. Safe.\n\nLEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** Enemy head at (3,9). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (3,10) off board \u274c\n- DOWN: (3,8) empty.\n- LEFT: (2,9) \u2013 their own body! \u274c That would kill them. Would they be that dumb? Maybe not, but they might avoid it.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) empty.\n\nSo they can only go DOWN or RIGHT safely. If they go DOWN to (3,8), and we go RIGHT to (1,8), no collision. If they go RIGHT to (4,9), also safe.\n\nIf we go UP to (0,9), they can't reach us. If we go DOWN to (0,7), also safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM AGGRESSION:** Enemy is up top with a body behind them. They're kinda trapped against the top wall! If they go RIGHT to (4,9), they have more space. If they go DOWN to (3,8), they move toward center. We want to cut off their escape! Moving RIGHT to (1,8) gets us closer to intercepting them if they go down. Moving UP to (0,9) grabs an apple and grows to length 2, but then our head is in the corner\u2014less flexible next turn. But growing early gives us score parity and makes us longer for future head-on clashes!\n\n**APPLE VS. POSITION:** Apple at (0,9) is free. Taking it puts us at 1 apple vs their 1. But then we're at (0,9) with body at (0,8). Next turn, our only safe moves would be DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT off board, UP off board). That's limiting! However, if we go RIGHT to (1,8) now, we stay length 1, keep more options open, and can maybe cut off enemy's path down. But we stay behind in apples.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** They'll likely go DOWN to (3,8) to avoid being stuck in the top-right. They might also go RIGHT to (4,9) to chase apple at (4,8)? But apple at (4,8) is two moves away. Hmm.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** If we go RIGHT to (1,8), next turn we could go RIGHT again to (2,8) and potentially block enemy from moving down if they're at (3,8). That's aggressive boxing! But we need to be longer to win head-on collisions. Since they have length 2, if we stay length 1, a head-on collision kills us both, but they win on apples. So we need to grow ASAP.\n\n**VERDICT:** Take the apple! Grow to length 2, tie the score, then use our new body segment to control space. Being at (0,9) next turn isn't ideal, but we can go DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9). We'll still have options. And we deny them the (0,9) apple.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** After eating, we'll be at (0,9) with body at (0,8). Likely move DOWN back to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9) to advance toward enemy. Watch where enemy goes this turn\u2014if they go DOWN to (3,8), we can try to cut them off.\n\nUP",

If they go DOWN to (4,8), we want to get to (2,8) or (3,8) to block them from moving left.

Actually if both die simultaneously, tie apples = draw. We want to AVOID draw. We need to get longer than them FIRST, then force the head-on. So we need an apple soon. Apple at (1,2) is far. (4,8) is closer but enemy might go for it. We need to maneuver to control space and trap them against the wall.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're at (1,9) next turn. Enemy likely at (4,8) or (5,9). If they're at (4,8), consider moving DOWN to (1,8) then RIGHT to (2,8) to block their leftward escape. If they're at (5,9), consider moving RIGHT to (2,9) to chase along top. AVOID moving into (3,9) or (4,9) unless we're longer. Scout apples near top-right: (4,8) is key. Deny it if possible.

More flexibility!\n\n**ENEMY BLOCKING:** Enemy at (4,8). If they go LEFT to (3,8), they're moving toward center.

They're LONGER! \ud83d\ude2c\n- I'm at top-left, enemy is center-right. They have a big advantage.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: (1, 9) \u274c MY OWN BODY (tail) \u2192 DEAD.\n- DOWN: (1, 7) \u2705 Empty ('.') \u2014 safe!\n- LEFT: (0, 8) \u2705 Empty ('.') \u2014 safe!\n- RIGHT: (2, 8) \u2705 Empty ('.') \u2014 safe!\n\nAll three DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe physically.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (4, 7).

We must avoid them and grab (0, 7) quickly.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey'll likely go DOWN to (4, 6) to eat apple and grow. That moves them away from us temporarily. Good.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (0, 8) \u2014 safe, hugs wall, sets up for (0, 7) apple next turn.\n2. Next turn: DOWN to (0, 7) to eat apple \u2192 grow to length 3.\n3. Then move toward (0, 4) or (0, 6) apples along left wall to grow more while staying safe.\n\nLEFT keeps us away from enemy, sets up apple grab, and avoids risky center.\n\nLEFT",

Going RIGHT gives us more freedom to maneuver!\n\n**DECISION:**\nDOWN is safe and sets up an apple next turn, but keeps us on the edge with fewer options.\nRIGHT is safe, gives MORE options next turn, AND also sets up an apple at (2, 6) next turn!

That's the same cell as our RIGHT move! \ud83d\ude31\n- DOWN: (2, 4) \u2705 Empty ('.').\n- LEFT: (1, 5) \u2705 Empty ('.') \u2014 same as our DOWN move! \ud83d\ude31\n- RIGHT: (3, 5) \u274c Their own body.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\nIf we go RIGHT to (2, 6) and enemy goes UP to (2, 6) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die! They have length 6, we have length 4 \u2192 they win on score if game ends! \u274c\u274c\u274c\nIf we go DOWN to (1, 5) and enemy goes LEFT to (1, 5) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die! They win on score! \u274c\u274c\u274c\nIf we go UP to (1, 7) \u2192 enemy can't reach (1, 7) in one move (their UP is (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT blocked). So UP is SAFE from head-on! \u2705\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nRIGHT gets apple but risks head-on death.\nUP is safe but no immediate apple.\nDOWN is safe but no immediate apple.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:**\nAfter UP to (1, 7):\n- Next turn head at (1, 7), body at (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8).\n- From (1, 7): UP (1, 8) \u274c own body, DOWN (1, 6) \u274c own body, LEFT (0, 7) \u274c own body, RIGHT (2, 7) \u2705 Empty \u2014 ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE! That's a TRAP! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nAfter DOWN to (1, 5):\n- Next turn head at (1, 5), body at (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8).\n- From (1, 5): UP (1, 6) \u274c own body, DOWN (1, 4) \u2705 Empty, LEFT (0, 5) \u2705 Empty, RIGHT (2, 5) \u274c enemy head? Wait, enemy might move away. But (2,5) could be safe if enemy leaves. Actually risky. But at least 2 safe moves likely.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey'll PROBABLY go UP to (2, 6) to eat that apple! That's the most tempting! So if we avoid (2,6) and (1,5), we survive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe MUST avoid head-on until we catch up in length! They have 6, we have 4. We need to grow safely! After UP, we'd be trapped with only RIGHT next turn \u2014 dangerous! After DOWN, we have more options and can maybe go for (0,4) apple later.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP leads to a dead-end next turn.\nRIGHT risks instant death head-on.\nDOWN risks head-on only if enemy goes LEFT to (1,5). But enemy likely wants the apple at (2,6) more! So DOWN is probably safe AND gives us future flexibility!\n\nWE PLAY IT SAFE AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Wait, they have 6 apples, length 7? Yes, starting length 3 + 6 apples = 9 segments? Hmm, their body list shows 6 segments after head, so total length 7. That matches: they ate 6 apples, starting length 3 \u2192 3+6=9? Wait, something's off. Let's trust the board: their body listed has 6 segments, so total snake length = 1 head + 6 body = 7. Starting length is 3, so they grew by 4? Actually they have 6 apples, so they should be length 9. But the board only shows up to (4,7) as tail. Maybe the body list is truncated for display? I'll assume they're long and dangerous!)\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (0,5):**\n- UP: (0, 6) \u274c MY OWN BODY \u2014 DEATH.\n- DOWN: (0, 4) \u2705 Apple ('A') \ud83c\udf4e \u2014 safe and GROW!\n- LEFT: (-1, 5) \u274c OFF BOARD \u2014 DEATH.\n- RIGHT: (1, 5) \u274c MY OWN BODY \u2014 DEATH.\n\nONLY DOWN IS SAFE! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (2, 3). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (2, 4) \u274c Their own body.\n- DOWN: (2, 2) \u2705 Empty.\n- LEFT: (1, 3) \u2705 Empty.\n- RIGHT: (3, 3) \u2705 Apple ('A').\n\nThey can't reach (0,4) in one move. So NO head-on risk this turn if we go DOWN.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\nDOWN (0,4) is an apple! Guaranteed growth to length 5! That's HUGE \u2014 we close the gap a bit.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS AFTER DOWN to (0,4):**\nNext turn head at (0,4), body: [(0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (0,6)] length 5.\nFrom (0,4): \n- UP: (0,5) \u274c own body (just moved there).\n- DOWN: (0,3) \u2705 Empty.\n- LEFT: off board \u274c.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) \u2705 Empty.\nSo two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Not great but workable.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy likely goes for apple at (3,3) RIGHT, or maybe LEFT to (1,3) to pressure us. They might try to cut us off.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are shorter, must avoid head-on. This turn we have only one safe move \u2014 DOWN to apple. That's fine! Grow to 5, then next turn we can go RIGHT to (1,4) to open space, or DOWN to (0,3). We need to maneuver toward center and maybe trap enemy later. Enemy is longer, so we must be aggressive but smart. After eating apple, we can try to circle around.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're at (0,4) next turn. Consider RIGHT to (1,4) to gain mobility, then maybe down toward apples at (1,2) or (4,1). Watch enemy head position \u2014 if they're close, avoid head-on. If we can force them into a wall or our body as we grow, do it! We need to equalize score!\n\nDOWN",

We're the underdog!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK from (0,3):**\n- UP: (0, 4) \u274c MY OWN BODY \u2014 DEATH.\n- DOWN: (0, 2) \u2705 Apple ('A')! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT: (-1, 3) \u274c OFF BOARD \u2014 DEATH.\n- RIGHT: (1, 3) \u2705 Empty.\n\nTWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN and RIGHT. DOWN gets us an apple! GROWTH!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nEnemy at (4, 3). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (4, 4) \u2705 Empty.\n- DOWN: (4, 2) \u2705 Apple ('A')! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT: (3, 3) \u274c Their own body.\n- RIGHT: (5, 3) \u2705 Empty.\n\nThey CANNOT reach (0,2) or (1,3) in one move. So NO immediate head-on risk. GOOD.\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\n- DOWN to (0,2): Apple! Immediate growth to length 6.\n- RIGHT to (1,3): No apple.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\nIf we go DOWN to (0,2) and eat apple:\n- Next turn from (0,2): UP (0,3) \u274c will be our new body segment after growth (since tail at (1,6) won't move yet? Wait, growth means our tail stays, so after moving DOWN to (0,2), our body becomes: head (0,2), then (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6) \u2014 length 6. So (0,3) is our neck \u2014 CAN'T go back UP into our own body! So UP \u274c. DOWN (0,1) \u2705 empty. LEFT off board \u274c. RIGHT (1,2) \u2705 Apple ('A')! So next turn we'd have DOWN and RIGHT as safe, with RIGHT leading to another apple! That's HUGE for catching up!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (1,3):\n- Next turn from (1,3): UP (1,4) \u2705 empty? Wait, check board: (1,4) is empty. DOWN (1,2) \u2705 Apple ('A')! LEFT (0,3) \u274c will be empty this turn but next turn? Actually if we move RIGHT now, (0,3) becomes empty. But next turn, if we go LEFT back to (0,3), that's fine unless our body grows into it. But our tail is at (1,6), so (0,3) stays empty. So LEFT might be safe next turn? Let's check: after moving RIGHT to (1,3), our body: head (1,3), then (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (1,6). So (0,3) is our neck \u2014 CAN'T go LEFT into it! So LEFT \u274c. RIGHT (2,3) \u274c enemy body (enemy segment at (2,3)). So only UP and DOWN would be safe next turn. That's better than one move, but not as good as DOWN path.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy likely goes DOWN to (4,2) to eat that apple and grow to length 10 (or 12?). That puts their head at (4,2), closer to bottom apples. They might then try to cut us off from the left side apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are shorter (length 5 vs their ~9). We NEED to grow FAST to compete. DOWN gives us an apple now AND sets up another apple at (1,2) next turn \u2014 that's two apples in two turns! That would bring us to 6 apples, still behind but closing the gap. Meanwhile, going RIGHT gives no immediate growth and might let enemy dominate the apple-rich bottom/left. We must be AGGRESSIVE in eating while avoiding traps. After eating (0,2) and then (1,2), we can consider going to (1,1) or (2,2) \u2014 but watch enemy movement. They are longer, so they have more body to navigate \u2014 we can be more nimble. Avoid getting pinned in the left column; after eating (1,2), maybe go DOWN to (1,1) then LEFT to (0,1) to loop? We'll assess next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWe're going DOWN to (0,2) apple! Next turn, likely RIGHT to (1,2) apple. Then we have options: DOWN to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,2) but that's our body, so probably DOWN. Watch enemy head \u2014 if they're at (4,2), they might move to (3,2) or (4,1) to block. Be ready to evade. Goal: equalize score by eating multiple apples on left/bottom. Avoid letting enemy cut off our escape from left wall. If enemy gets too close, consider moving up through (1,3) later. Stay agile!\n\nDOWN",

BUT THEY MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY \u2014 WE MUST ANTICIPATE THEIR NEXT POSITION TO AVOID FUTURE TRAPS! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**APPLE PROXIMITY:**\n- UP (1,3): NO APPLE.\n- DOWN (1,1): NO APPLE.\n- RIGHT (2,2): NO APPLE.\n\nNO APPLES ADJACENT THIS TURN \u2014 BUT WE CAN SET UP FOR FUTURE APPLES!

THEY MIGHT GO FOR (3,1) THIS TURN! IF THEY DO, THEY BLOCK OUR PATH.

ENEMY MIGHT BE HEADING TO (3,1) \u2014 IF THEY GO THERE, WE CAN GO LEFT TO (0,1) THEN DOWN TO (0,0) TO LOOP AROUND BOTTOM.

ALSO, ENEMY HEAD COULD MOVE TO (3,1) OR (4,0) \u2014 POTENTIALLY CUTTING US OFF. RISKY!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nENEMY LIKELY GOES LEFT TO (3,1) TO EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e THEY'RE GREEDY \u2014 10 APPLES ALREADY! THAT WOULD PUT THEM AT (3,1), BLOCKING OUR PATH TO (3,0) AND (3,1). THEY'D THEN BE LONGER (LENGTH 11) AND SLOWER TO TURN. WE CAN USE THAT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWE NEED TO STAY NIMBLE AND OUTMANEUVER! GOING DOWN TO (1,1) GIVES US MAX OPTIONS NEXT TURN. FROM THERE, WE CAN:\n- GO LEFT TO (0,1) \u2192 DOWN TO (0,0) \u2192 RIGHT ALONG BOTTOM ROW TO SCOOP APPLES AT (3,0), (6,0).\n- OR GO RIGHT TO (2,1) \u2192 DOWN TO (2,0) \u2192 APPROACH (3,0).\nAVOID GOING UP INTO ENEMY BODY MAZE. IF ENEMY TAKES (3,1), WE CAN STILL DIP UNDER THEM. OUR LENGTH IS 7 \u2014 WE CAN TURN TIGHTER THAN THEIR LENGTH ~11! USE THAT AGILITY TO BOX THEM IN LATER! FORCE THEM INTO A WALL OR THEIR OWN BODY!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nWE'RE GOING DOWN TO (1,1) FOR FLEXIBILITY! NEXT TURN, ASSESS ENEMY HEAD POSITION \u2014 IF THEY'RE AT (3,1), GO LEFT TO (0,1) TO AVOID HEAD-ON AND LOOP BOTTOM. IF THEY'RE ELSEWHERE, CONSIDER RIGHT TO (2,1) TO APPROACH (3,0) APPLE. STAY AWAY FROM MIDDLE WHERE THEIR BODY BLOCKS. KEEP EATING AND CLOSE THE SCORE GAP! WHEN WE'RE LONGER, AIM TO TRAP THEM AGAINST THEIR OWN TAIL! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

Risky!  \n- **RIGHT** slides us to (4,0), an empty cell that pushes us toward the tasty apple at (6,0) and keeps our body clear of immediate traps.

THEY'RE LONG, SO TAIL MOVES SLOWLY. (3,2) IS THEIR BODY SEGMENT NOW, BUT AS THEY MOVE, IT MIGHT BECOME TAIL EVENTUALLY. BUT WE CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG!\n\nWE NEED TO PLAN ESCAPE FROM (2,2) BY GOING RIGHT INTO (3,2) ONCE IT'S FREE. THAT REQUIRES ENEMY TO MOVE THEIR BODY OUT. THEY'RE HEADING RIGHT, SO THEIR BODY WILL SHIFT RIGHT, LEAVING (3,2) FREE IN A FEW TURNS? LET'S HOPE! OTHERWISE, WE DIE IN 2 TURNS.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** ENEMY IS FORCED RIGHT TO (5,0) THIS TURN. NEXT TURN, FROM (5,0), THEIR OPTIONS: UP (5,1) EMPTY?, DOWN (5,-1) OFF, LEFT (4,0) THEIR BODY, RIGHT (6,0) EMPTY? THEY'LL LIKELY GO RIGHT TO (6,0) (TOWARD APPLE AT (6,0)?). THEY'LL MOVE ALONG BOTTOM. WE CAN USE THIS TO SLITHER UP AND AROUND TO CUT THEM OFF FROM TOP. BUT WE MUST SURVIVE THE NEXT TWO TURNS!\n\n**FUTURE SELF NOTE:** FROM (2,2) NEXT TURN, IF (3,2) STILL ENEMY BODY, WE'RE DEAD. BUT IF ENEMY MOVES FAR RIGHT, THEIR BODY MIGHT SHIFT ENOUGH THAT (3,2) BECOMES FREE? CHECK THEIR BODY LIST: (3,2) IS NOT LISTED \u2014 ACTUALLY ENEMY BODY: [(3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]. (3,2) IS NOT THERE! BOARD SHOWS 'T' AT (3,2)? LOOK AT BOARD: AT COORD (3,2) \u2014 X=3, Y=2 \u2014 ROW 2, COL 3: SHOWS '.'! WAIT, LET'S READ BOARD CAREFULLY:\n\nROW 2: \"2 T T . . T . A . . .\" THAT'S Y=2. X=0: 'T', X=1: 'T', X=2: '.', X=3: '.', X=4: 'T', X=5: '.', X=6: 'A', ETC. SO (3,2) IS '.'! MY BAD! (3,2) IS EMPTY! YES! SO FROM (2,2) NEXT TURN, RIGHT TO (3,2) IS SAFE! \ud83d\ude05\n\nTHEN FROM (2,1) THIS TURN UP TO (2,2) NEXT TURN, THEN RIGHT TO (3,2) IS POSSIBLE! WE HAVE ESCAPE! LET'S GO!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE THIS TURN \u2014 UP TO (2,1). THEN NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (2,3)? NO (2,3) ENEMY BODY. BUT WE CAN GO RIGHT TO (3,2) TO OPEN SPACE. GOOD!\n\nUP",

Does that move get us closer to the win? Not really.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,-1) rockets us off the board.

Stepping there is a guaranteed self\u2011kill. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,0) lands on an apple \ud83c\udf4e, grows us by +1, and moves us forward into free space while staying far from the rival\u2019s head at (2,1). Plus, after the move we\u2019ll still have UP, DOWN, and RIGHT as viable escapes next turn.  \n\n\u2705 Only **RIGHT** passes every survival check, grabs a tasty apple, and expands our lead.  \n\nPlan:  \n- Eat the (6,0) apple now \u2192 grow longer.  \n- Continue sweeping right along the bottom row, hunting the cluster of apples at (5,3), (6,4), etc.  \n- Keep the enemy boxed while we accumulate a bigger score, then force a head\u2011on collision when our apple count eclipses theirs.  \n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY MOVING RIGHT TO (7,0) OR UP TO (6,1) \u2014 NO HEAD-ON. SAFE.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLANNING FROM (3,2):**\nFROM (3,2) OUR POTENTIAL OPTIONS (ASSUMING ENEMY MOVES THIS TURN):\n- UP: (3,3) \u2014 CURRENTLY ENEMY BODY 'T', BUT IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT, THEIR BODY SHIFTS \u2014 MAY BECOME FREE? \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN: (3,1) \u2014 CURRENTLY ENEMY BODY 'T', SAME LOGIC.\n- LEFT: (2,2) \u2014 WILL BE OUR BODY (OUR OLD HEAD) \u2014 BLOCKED.\n- RIGHT: (4,2) \u2014 CURRENTLY ENEMY BODY 'T' \u2014 MAY BECOME FREE IF ENEMY MOVES?\n\nENEMY'S BODY IS LONG \u2014 IF THEY MOVE RIGHT, THEIR TAIL AT (4,5) MIGHT NOT SHIFT MUCH, BUT THEIR NECK AT (5,0) MOVES, FREEING (5,0) FOR BODY SHIFT? LET'S TRACK: ENEMY BODY LIST SHOWS HEAD (6,0), THEN (5,0), (4,0), ETC. IF THEY MOVE RIGHT TO (7,0), THEIR NEW BODY BECOMES [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), ...]. SO (4,0) STAYS, (3,0) STAYS, ETC. (3,1) AND (3,3) ARE PART OF THEIR MID-BODY \u2014 THOSE WON'T MOVE YET! SO (3,3) AND (3,1) REMAIN BLOCKED NEXT TURN! \ud83d\ude31\n\nBUT (4,2) IS ENEMY BODY \u2014 THAT ALSO WON'T MOVE YET. SO FROM (3,2) TOMORROW, WE COULD BE TRAPPED WITH ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS BLOCKED! UNLESS ENEMY MOVES UP TO (6,1), WHICH SHIFTS THEIR BODY DIFFERENTLY? STILL, (3,1) AND (3,3) LIKELY STAY.\n\n**WE NEED AN ESCAPE ROUTE!** AFTER MOVING TO (3,2), WE MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE EXIT. LET'S CHECK BOARD FOR NEARBY OPENINGS: (4,2) ENEMY, (3,3) ENEMY, (3,1) ENEMY, (2,2) US. LOOK AT (4,3)? BOARD SHOWS (4,3) IS ENEMY BODY 'T'. (4,1)? ENEMY BODY 'T'. SO WE'RE SURROUNDED BY ENEMY BODY WALL! UNLESS ENEMY EATS AN APPLE AND GROWS, BUT THAT DOESN'T SHIFT BODY BACK.\n\n**WAIT \u2014 ENEMY'S TAIL IS AT (4,5)?** ACTUALLY THEIR BODY LIST ENDS WITH (4,5) \u2014 SO IF THEY DON'T EAT AN APPLE THIS TURN, THEIR TAIL WILL MOVE FORWARD WHEN THEY MOVE. THAT MEANS THE LAST SEGMENT (4,5) VACATES! BUT THAT'S FAR FROM US. THE CELLS BLOCKING US ARE (3,1), (3,3), (4,2) \u2014 THOSE ARE NOT TAIL. SO THEY WON'T BECOME FREE NEXT TURN.\n\n**THIS IS BAD!** MOVING RIGHT TO (3,2) COULD BE A DEATH TRAP NEXT TURN! BUT WE HAVE NO OTHER SAFE MOVE NOW \u2014 WE MUST GO RIGHT OR DIE IMMEDIATELY. SO WE GO RIGHT, THEN PRAY ENEMY DOES SOMETHING THAT FREES A CELL NEAR US? OR WE USE THIS TO OUR ADVANTAGE?\n\n**AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY:** ENEMY IS LONG, WE ARE SHORT. WE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE RISKS. MAYBE FROM (3,2) WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION LATER IF WE GROW? BUT WE'RE BEHIND IN LENGTH. BETTER TO FOCUS ON SURVIVAL AND GROWTH.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:** WE'RE MOVING RIGHT TO (3,2). NEXT TURN, CHECK IF (4,2), (3,3), OR (3,1) BECOME FREE AFTER ENEMY MOVES. IF STILL BLOCKED, WE MIGHT BE STUCK \u2014 BUT ENEMY MIGHT MOVE UP, FREEING (3,3) OR (3,1) EVENTUALLY? WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER THAT ENEMY'S BODY WILL SHIFT OVER TIME AS THEY MOVE. IF WE STAY ALIVE, SPACE MAY OPEN. LOOK FOR QUICK PATHS TO APPLES LIKE (5,4) OR (6,4) TO GROW AND CATCH UP. USE OUR SMALL SIZE TO SLIP THROUGH TIGHT GAPS. AVOID HEAD-ON UNTIL WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE. IF TRAPPED TOMORROW, WE MAY HAVE TO GAMBLE ON A DIRECTION BECOMING FREE \u2014 BUT FOR NOW, SURVIVE THIS TURN!\n\nRIGHT",

SO WE CHOOSE THE DIRECTION THAT AT LEAST HAS A CHANCE IF ENEMY DOES SOMETHING UNEXPECTED, LIKE MOVES LEFT AND THEIR BODY SHIFTS DIFFERENTLY? ACTUALLY, IF ENEMY MOVES LEFT TO (5,1) AND NO GROWTH, THEIR BODY SHIFTS: (3,3) BECOMES (2,3) AFTER SHIFT? NO, (3,3) STAYS (3,3) IN NEW BODY LIST? LET'S SIMULATE: OLD BODY LIST ABOVE. AFTER MOVING LEFT WITHOUT GROWTH, NEW BODY: HEAD (5,1), THEN (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). TAIL (3,5) GONE. SO (3,3) STILL IN BODY. NO CHANGE.**\n\n**SO ALL DIRECTIONS SEEM FATAL. BUT WE MUST MOVE. LET'S PICK UP \u2014 AT LEAST IF BY SOME MIRACLE ENEMY'S BODY VACATES (3,3) (IMPOSSIBLE), WE LIVE. OTHERWISE, WE DIE. BUT MAYBE THE SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT MEANS WE DIE ONLY IF AFTER MOVEMENT THE CELL IS OCCUPIED. IF ENEMY MOVES AND THAT CELL BECOMES EMPTY, WE SURVIVE. BUT (3,3) WILL NOT BECOME EMPTY. SO WE DIE.**\n\n**WAIT \u2014 COULD THERE BE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH ENEMY IF THEY MOVE INTO (3,3) WHILE WE MOVE INTO (3,3)? ENEMY HEAD AT (6,1), CAN'T REACH (3,3) IN ONE MOVE. SO NO.**\n\n**I THINK WE'RE DEAD. BUT LET'S CHECK THE BOARD AGAIN \u2014 MAYBE (4,2) IS ACTUALLY EMPTY? BOARD SHOWS (4,2) AS 'T' (ENEMY BODY). SO NO.**\n\n**FINAL GAMBLE: MOVE RIGHT INTO (4,2). IF ENEMY HAPPENS TO MOVE SUCH THAT (4,2) IS VACATED (NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE), WE LIVE. OTHERWISE, WE DIE. BUT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE. LET'S GO RIGHT AND HOPE FOR A MIRACLE. \ud83d\ude2d**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF (IF WE SURVIVE):** WE NEED TO ESCAPE THIS ENCIRCLEMENT! IF WE MIRACULOUSLY LIVE, MOVE TOWARD OPEN SPACES LIKE UPPER RIGHT. EAT APPLES AT (5,4) OR (6,4) TO GROW. AVOID ENEMY UNTIL WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE. USE OUR SMALL SIZE TO SLIP THROUGH GAPS. BUT RIGHT NOW, SURVIVE THIS TURN!\n\nRIGHT",
