UP to (5, 9): Safe. Closer to top edge.\n2. DOWN to (5, 7): Safe. Moves toward the board center.\n3. LEFT to (4, 8): Safe. Moves toward the board center.\n4. RIGHT to (6, 8): Safe.

Snake #1 is very far from me and far from my target apples A4 and A2.\nA1 (1, 6): MD = |0-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Closest for Snake #1)\nA2 (6, 4): MD = |0-6| + |5-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\nA4 (7, 6): MD = |0-7| + |5-6| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSnake #1 will likely go for A1 (1, 6).\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1. UP to (0, 6): MD to A1 = 1 (1, 6)\n2. DOWN to (0, 4): MD to A1 = 4\n3. RIGHT to (1, 5): MD to A1 = 1\n\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 5), it will be very close to A1.\n\nSince the enemy snake is busy near A1, I should focus on A4 (7, 6) or A2 (6, 4). A4 (7, 6) is slightly closer.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7), I reach (5, 7).\nNew MD to A4 (7, 6) is 3.\nNew MD to A2 (6, 4) is 4.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 8), I reach (6, 8).\nNew MD to A4 (7, 6) is 3.\nNew MD to A2 (6, 4) is 5.\n\nMoving DOWN is slightly better for overall options as it also gets me closer to A2 (6, 4).\n\nLet's check potential head-on collisions. My current position (5, 8) is far from the enemy (0, 5). Even if I move (5, 7) or (6, 8), the enemy head cannot reach me.\n\nI will choose DOWN to move towards the center and the cluster of apples on the right side of the board.\n\nStrategy: Target A4 (7, 6) first, as it is the closest and away from the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Move DOWN to (5, 6): MD to A4 decreases to 3. (Neutral, same MD)\n3. Move LEFT to (4, 7): MD to A4 increases to 4. (Bad)\n4. Move RIGHT to (6, 7): MD to A4 decreases to 2. (Best)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 7) directly reduces distance to A4 (7, 6) by 1.\n\nLet's check A2 (6, 4):\n1. Move UP to (5, 8): MD to A2 increases to 5.\n2.

If Snake #1 moves UP to (0, 5), it is still far from me at (6, 7). If it moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it is still far from me. There is no risk of collision.\n\nMy chosen move: RIGHT to (6, 7). This puts me in a strong position to grab A4 (7, 6) next turn (by moving RIGHT or DOWN), or the turn after that. If I move to (6, 7), A4 is 2 moves away.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 7):\nNext turn, I can move:\n- RIGHT to (7, 7): 1 step away from A4 (7, 6).\n- DOWN to (6, 6): 2 steps away from A4 (7, 6), 2 steps away from A2 (6, 4).\n\nLet's look ahead:\nIf I move RIGHT (6, 7).\nTurn 2: I move RIGHT again to (7, 7). MD to A4 (7, 6) is 1. (7, 7) is empty.\nTurn 3: I move DOWN to (7, 6) and eat A4.\n\nThis seems like a solid, safe, and efficient path to the nearest apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Which one is better?\n\n*   If I move **DOWN to (6, 6)**: I am now 1 step away from A4 (7, 6). The path to A4 would require moving RIGHT next turn. I am also 2 steps away from A2 (6, 4).\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: I am now 1 step away from A4 (7, 6). The path to A4 would require moving DOWN next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT leads to (7, 7), which is geographically closer to A4: (7, 7) is adjacent to A4's X coordinate (7). Moving DOWN leads to (6, 6), which is adjacent to A4's Y coordinate (6). Both are equally good for reaching A4 on Turn 3.\n\nLet's look at the location of Snake #1 (0, 3).\nSnake #1 moved DOWN last turn (from (0, 4) to (0, 3)). Snake #1 is prioritizing A1 (1, 6).\nMD from (0, 3) to A1 (1, 6) is |0-1| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nSnake #1 is likely to move UP to (0, 4) (MD=3) or RIGHT to (1, 3) (MD=3).\nRegardless of Snake #1's move, it is far away and poses no collision risk.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are excellent moves.\nIf I choose RIGHT (7, 7):\nTurn 3 plan: DOWN to (7, 6) and eat A4.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (6, 6):\nTurn 3 plan: RIGHT to (7, 6) and eat A4.\n\nI will choose RIGHT as it keeps me slightly more central to the top right quadrant where two apples are located (A4 and A2). If A4 is taken by an unseen factor, (7, 7) makes a move to A2 (6, 4) easier than (6, 6) does, as the latter is directly adjacent to A2 if I move UP/DOWN.\nDistance from (7, 7) to A2 (6, 4) is 1 + 3 = 4.\nDistance from (6, 6) to A2 (6, 4) is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nSince A4 is the primary target and both moves achieve the minimum distance (MD=1), let's stick to the path intended in the last rationale: Move RIGHT to set up an immediate DOWN next turn to capture A4.\n\nChosen move: RIGHT to (7, 7).\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nTargeting A4 (7, 6).\nTurn 3: Move DOWN to (7, 6) to eat A4, assuming safety.\nAfter eating, the next target will likely be A2 (6, 4).\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 moved UP from (0, 3) in the previous turn.\n\nApples are at: A1 (1, 6), A2 (6, 4), A3 (2, 1), A4 (7, 6), A5 (9, 0).\n\nMy immediate goal is to collect A4 (7, 6), which is now adjacent to my head.\n\n**My snake (ID 0) at (7, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe. This is A4.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe. (This is where I was last turn)\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Safe.\n\n**Distance Evaluation (Manhattan Distance to Apples):**\n\n| Apple | Location | MD from (7, 7) |\n|-------|----------|----------------|\n| A4 | (7, 6) | 1 (Immediate Target) |\n| A2 | (6, 4) | 1 + 3 = 4 |\n| A1 | (1, 6) | 6 + 1 = 7 |\n| A5 | (9, 0) | 2 + 7 = 9 |\n| A3 | (2, 1) | 5 + 6 = 11 |\n\n**Evaluating moves based on A4 (7, 6):**\n\nThe move DOWN takes me directly onto A4.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** Collects A4. This is the optimal move.\n\n**Considering Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 4). Snake #1 moved UP last turn.\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n*   UP to (0, 5)\n*   DOWN to (0, 3)\n*   RIGHT to (1, 4) (MD to A1 (1, 6) = 1 + 2 = 3)\n*   LEFT (Wall collision, unsafe)\n\nSnake #1 is far away (Manhattan Distance 6+3=9 away from me). There is no risk of collision or competition for A4. Snake #1 is likely targeting A1 (1, 6). If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it gets closer to A1.\n\nMy move: DOWN to (7, 6) to capture the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 3:** Move DOWN to (7, 6) and collect A4. Snake length becomes 2 (Head (7, 6), Tail (7, 7)).\n2.  **Turn 4:** Target A2 (6, 4). From (7, 6), MD to (6, 4) is 1 + 2 = 3. A DOWN/LEFT move will be required. If I move LEFT to (6, 6), MD to A2 is 2.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",
