We're sitting pretty at (1,3) and the apple at (1,2) is basically BEGGING to get eaten! You think we're gonna pass up a free meal while our rival's chilling on the other side of the map? NO CHANCE!\n\nLet me break down these options like we're drafting his defeat:\n\n**UP?** Bro, that's (1,4) - that's literally our own neck! You wanna pull a self-KO on turn 4? That's not aggressive, that's SUICIDAL! Hard pass! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80\n\n**LEFT?** (0,3) keeps us alive, sure, but it's playing NOT TO LOSE instead of playing TO WIN! No apple there, just a one-way ticket to Boring Town against the wall! We ain't about that life! \u274c\ud83e\uddf1\n\n**RIGHT?** (2,3) is technically safe, but it's leaving MONEY ON THE TABLE! Why drift sideways when there's a JUICY apple right below us? That's coward territory, and we don't wear that jersey! \ud83e\udd71\u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN?** BABY, THAT'S THE PLAY! (1,2) has that sweet, sweet apple waiting for us! We eat that, we TIE THE SCORE 3-3, we GROW to length 4 to match that pretender on the right side, and we open up the SICKEST rotation toward (2,1) for the LEAD! We're about to feast while he's still figuring out how to cross the board! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\ud83d\udcc8\n\nCheck the map - he's stuck at (7,7) with his little posse at x=8 and x=9! He thinks he owns the right side? Let him have it! We're building an EMPIRE on the left flank! By the time he waddles over here, we'll be LONG enough to box him into a postage stamp! \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Just ate at (1,2), now we're length 4 with score 3. Next turn prioritize securing (2,1) for the LEAD, or rotate toward center apples at (3,3) and (4,3) to control the mid. Keep an eye on enemy movement - if he comes left, we cut him off with our superior length. Stay hungry, stay lethal! Let's goooo! \ud83d\udc51\ud83e\udd4a\n\nDOWN",

NO! \u274c\ud83e\uddf1\n\n**DOWN to (1,1)?** Okay, hear me out - this gets us closer to that juicy apple at (2,1), BUT it puts us on the bottom shelf at y=1!

Next turn we drop DOWN to (2,1) and eat that apple to tie the score at 4-4! After that, prioritize the (3,3) or (4,3) apples to solidify center control. If the enemy stays top-right, we box him out. If he comes center, we use our length advantage to force a head-to-head where we win the timing! Stay greedy, stay lethal! Let's GOOOO! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

ARE YOU TRYING TO EAT YOUR OWN NECK?! \ud83e\udd2f That's literally our body segment right there! That's not a move, that's a SUICIDE SPEEDRUN! We're trying to clutch this W, not speedrun the respawn screen! HARD PASS! \ud83d\udeab\u2620\ufe0f\n\n**DOWN to (2,1)?** Okay, okay, I see the apple staring at us like a juicy bonus orb! \ud83c\udf4e Tempting, right? WRONG! That's a TRAP CARD, CHAT! \ud83c\udccf Sure we tie the score at 4-4, but then we're stuck in the BOTTOM CORNER with our tail blocking our escape routes! We'd need THREE TURNS just to crawl back to the center cluster while our boy is feasting on the (3,3), (4,3) BUFFET! We're playing chess, not checkers! \u274c\u265f\ufe0f\n\n**UP to (2,3)?** Decent positioning, not gonna lie! Gets us closer to the action! \ud83d\udc46 BUT check the geometry - once we slide up there, our tail is at (1,3) and our neck is at (2,2), meaning LEFT and DOWN are INSTANT DEATH ZONES! \ud83d\udd12 We'd be forced to go RIGHT to (3,3) next turn or UP to (2,4). It's a 2-lane highway when we need an EXPRESSWAY! Too cramped for my taste! \ud83e\udd0f\n\n**RIGHT to (3,2)?** OH BABY, THAT'S THE SPOT! \ud83c\udfaf\u2728 \n\nLook at this BEAUTY! We slide to (3,2), our tail drops off (1,4) opening up space, and suddenly we're the GATEKEEPERS OF THE CENTER! \ud83c\udff0 From here:\n- UP puts us on (3,3) for that apple NEXT TURN! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n- RIGHT keeps us mobile toward the (4,3) cluster!\n- DOWN gives us escape routes if things get spicy!\n\nWe're talking about ESTABLISHING DOMINANCE in the 3-4 x 3-5 zone where ALL the apples are hiding! \ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f While that fool is doing laps in the top-right at y=7, we're about to set up SHOP in the downtown district! By the time he waddles down to contest, we'll be a 6-segment MONSTER controlling every corridor! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc51\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE ME:** Just moved RIGHT to (3,2). Next turn we claim that (3,3) apple to tie the score, then prioritize chaining (4,3) and (3,5) to establish center dominance. If the enemy tries to descend from (5,7), we'll have the length and positioning to cut him off or force a favorable trade. Stay central, stay lethal! Let's GOOOO! \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",
