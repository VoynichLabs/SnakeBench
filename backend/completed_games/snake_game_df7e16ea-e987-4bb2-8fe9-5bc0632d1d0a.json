UP \u2192 (8, 4) \u2013 onto an apple, valid.\n2. DOWN \u2192 (8, 2) \u2013 into its own body, but allowed (moving away).\n3. LEFT \u2192 (7, 3) \u2013 valid.\n4.

Moving LEFT to (4, 7) is also safe but may limit future options if the enemy moves toward me. Moving RIGHT to (6, 7) is safe but may bring me closer to the enemy's head if it moves UP.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- (3, 8): 2 steps left, 1 step up from (5, 7).\n- (2, 7): 3 steps left from (5, 7).\n- (5, 4): 3 steps down from (5, 7).\n- (2, 2): 3 steps left, 5 steps down from (5, 7).\n- (6, 0): 1 step right, 7 steps down from (5, 7).\n\nThe apple at (3, 8) is the closest and most immediate target. Moving UP to (5, 8) would position me closer to (3, 8) for the next turn. Moving LEFT to (4, 7) would also move me toward (3, 8) but may be riskier if the enemy moves toward me. Moving RIGHT to (6, 7) is less optimal for apple collection.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Avoid the enemy's head and body while collecting apples.\n- Prioritize apples that are not in the enemy's immediate path.\n- Stay near the top of the board to have more space to maneuver.\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners or near the enemy's likely path.\n- The apple at (3, 8) is a good target as it is close and away from the enemy's current position.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP is the best move as it keeps me safe from the enemy's likely path, avoids immediate threats, and positions me near the apple at (3, 8) for future turns.\n\nUP",

However, if the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5), they could be adjacent to my head at (2, 7) next turn, which is a risk.\n- Moving UP to (2, 9) is safe but does not progress toward any apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 8) is safe and positions me to potentially move DOWN to (1, 7) next turn, but this is not as direct as moving DOWN now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Collect the apple at (2, 7) this turn by moving DOWN. This is the most efficient path to increase my score.\n- After collecting (2, 7), assess the next closest apple (likely (3, 3) or (0, 5)) and plan accordingly.\n- Avoid the enemy's head and body while collecting apples. If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5), I will need to be cautious next turn.\n- Stay near the top of the board to have more space to maneuver and avoid getting trapped.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN is the best move as it collects the closest apple and increases my score, while the immediate risk from the enemy is low.\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP to (0,6) is the most likely, as it avoids its own body and moves toward the apple at (0,5) (though the apple is already at (0,5)? Wait, the apple at (0,5) was collected by the enemy last turn, so it's no longer there. The remaining apples are at (2,2), (6,0), (3,3), (7,8), (5,0). The enemy may move UP to (0,6) to avoid its body or DOWN to (0,4) to move toward (2,2) or (3,3).\n- My UP to (1,9) is safe and positions me to move RIGHT toward (7,8) next turn.\n- My LEFT to (0,8) is safe but risks a head-on collision if the enemy moves UP to (0,6) and then RIGHT to (1,6) or (0,7) in future turns. However, the immediate risk is low.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- **(7, 8):** 6 steps right from (1,8). Reachable via RIGHT moves after UP to (1,9).\n- **(3, 3):** 2 steps right, 5 steps down from (1,8). Far but reachable.\n- **(2, 2):** 1 step right, 6 steps down from (1,8). Far.\n- **(6, 0):** 5 steps right, 8 steps down from (1,8). Very far.\n- **(5, 0):** 4 steps right, 8 steps down from (1,8). Very far.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Avoid the enemy's head and potential head-on collisions. The enemy is likely to move UP to (0,6) to avoid its body and may then move RIGHT toward (1,6) or (2,6) in future turns.\n- Prefer UP to (1,9) to position myself to move RIGHT toward (7,8) next turn. This is the safest path to a nearby apple and avoids the enemy's likely movement.\n- LEFT to (0,8) is also safe but slightly riskier if the enemy moves UP and then RIGHT in future turns. However, the immediate risk is low, and it could position me to move DOWN toward (3,3) or (2,2) later.\n- Prioritize collecting the apple at (7,8) as it is the closest and safest to reach from (1,9).\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP is the safest move, avoids immediate risks, and positions me well to move toward the apple at (7,8) next turn while keeping options open.\n\nUP",

This could be a good long-term path to (7,8) but may not be optimal short-term.\n- My DOWN to (4,7) is safe and positions me to move toward (3,3) or (5,2). This is a good intermediate step toward those apples.\n- My RIGHT to (5,8) is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (7,8). This is the most direct path to the closest apple.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- **(7, 8):** 2 steps right, 0 steps down from (4,8). Reachable via RIGHT moves.\n- **(3, 3):** 1 step left, 5 steps down from (4,8). Far but reachable.\n- **(5, 2):** 1 step right, 6 steps down from (4,8). Far.\n- **(6, 0):** 2 steps right, 8 steps down from (4,8). Very far.\n- **(5, 0):** 1 step right, 8 steps down from (4,8). Very far.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- The apple at (7,8) is the closest and most reachable. Moving RIGHT to (5,8) is the best immediate step toward it.\n- Avoid the enemy's likely moves (RIGHT to (3,2) or UP to (2,3)) by not moving into their path. My current path to (7,8) is along the top row, which is relatively safe.\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (3,2), they may block my path to (3,3) or (5,2), but I can still focus on (7,8).\n- Prioritize the closest apple (7,8) while maintaining flexibility. RIGHT to (5,8) is the best move.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nRIGHT",

The apple at (7,9) is directly above my head (1 step up).\n\n**Possible Moves from (7, 8):**\n1. **UP \u2192 (7, 9):** Valid (on board, no immediate collision, and onto the apple at (7,9)).\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (7, 7):** Valid (on board, no immediate collision).\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (6, 8):** Into my own body (invalid, moving backwards).\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8):** Valid (on board, no immediate collision).\n\n**Eliminate invalid moves:**\n- LEFT is invalid (moving backwards into my own body).\n- UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are valid.\n\n**Enemy Snake Possible Moves from (3, 2):**\n1. **UP \u2192 (3, 3):** Into its own body (invalid, moving backwards).\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (3, 1):** Valid (avoids its body).\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (2, 2):** Into its own body (invalid, moving backwards).\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2):** Valid (toward the apple at (5,2)).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- The enemy is likely to move RIGHT to (4,2) to avoid its body and move toward the apple at (5,2). Moving DOWN to (3,1) is also possible but less likely as it moves away from most apples.\n- My UP to (7,9) is safe and moves me directly onto the apple at (7,9).

Directly reachable via UP.\n- **(9, 4):** 2 steps right, 5 steps down from (7,8). Far.\n- **(5, 2):** 2 steps left, 6 steps down from (7,8).

However, it does not move me closer to any apples.\n  - DOWN moves me toward the center, which is safer long-term and may open paths to apples like (1,3) or (0,0), though the enemy is closer to these.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\n- **(1, 3):** 1 step left and 6 steps down from (2,9). The enemy is closer to this apple (head at (7,0), so 6 steps left and 3 steps up). Contesting this apple is risky.\n- **(0, 0):** 2 steps left and 9 steps down from (2,9). My body blocks the direct path, and the enemy is closer.\n- **(9, 4) and (9, 6):** Far from my current position, and the enemy is not directly contesting them.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Avoid the enemy's likely path (e.g., toward (7,1) or (8,0)) to minimize risk of head-on collisions.\n- Move DOWN to (2,8) to open up more space and avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner. This keeps future options open and may allow me to contest apples later.\n- After moving DOWN, reassess the board for the next closest apple or safe path. The apple at (1,3) may become reachable if the enemy does not take it immediately.\n- Be cautious of the left edge to avoid getting trapped.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN",
