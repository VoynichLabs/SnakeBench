The key difference:\n\n- **UP to (9, 4)**: Takes the apple directly above me. This is my planned move from last turn. After eating this apple, I'll be at score 6 with my head at (9, 4). Future moves would be constrained by the board edge (can't go right or up much further).\n\n- **LEFT to (8, 3)**: Takes the apple to my left. This moves me closer to the center of the board and opens up more directional options for future moves. The apple at (8, 3) is also directly reachable.\n\nBoth lead to immediate apple collection. However, **LEFT is strategically superior** because:\n1. It also collects an apple (reaching score 6)\n2. It moves me away from the right edge, giving me more room to maneuver in future turns\n3. After collecting at (8, 3), I'll be at (8, 3) and can continue LEFT, UP, or DOWN with good spacing\n4. Moving UP would trap me closer to the corner with fewer escape routes\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move LEFT to (8, 3), collect the apple, then continue pursuing apples in the central/left portions of the board.

UP appears slightly better for closing distance efficiently.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4, 9) with no body segments, so no immediate collision threat.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Focus on collecting the apple at (5, 8) as it's the closest.

Yes, no collision\n   - Moves closer to apple at (5, 8): distance becomes 2 (just 2 left, 0 up)\n   - Gets me very close to the nearest apple\n   - Good move!\n\n2. **DOWN**: Head would move to (7, 6)\n   - Safe? NO - (7, 6) is my body (first body segment)\n   - This would kill me immediately\n   - ELIMINATE\n\n3. **LEFT**: Head would move to (6, 7)\n   - Safe? Yes, no collision\n   - Moves closer to apple at (5, 8): distance becomes 2 (1 left, 1 up)\n   - Also gets me close to the target\n   - Good move!\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Head would move to (8, 7)\n   - Safe? Yes, no collision\n   - Moves away from nearest apple\n   - Not optimal\n\n**Safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT**\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n- UP to (7, 8): Then LEFT to (6, 8), then LEFT to (5, 8) to collect the apple\n- LEFT to (6, 7): Then UP to (6, 8), then LEFT to (5, 8) to collect the apple\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient (2 more moves to reach the apple). UP seems slightly more direct since it moves me to y=8, which is the same row as the target apple at (5, 8). Then I can move LEFT twice to grab it.\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Snake #0 is at (4, 6), still far away. No immediate threat from head-on collision.\n\n**Strategy note:** Continue moving toward (5, 8) - this is my closest apple. After collecting it on turn 27, I'll have 8 apples and be at (5, 8). Then I should pivot toward either (7, 0) or (4, 2) depending on safety and positioning. The goal is to reach 30 apples to win the game.\n\nUP",

Yes, within bounds\n   - Moves away from nearby apples\n   - Dead-end move (board ends at y=9)\n   - Not optimal\n\n2. **DOWN**: Head moves to (4, 7)\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds and no collision\n   - Moves toward (4, 2) apple below me\n   - Could also eventually reach (1, 5)\n   - Good directional move\n\n3. **LEFT**: Head moves to (3, 8)\n   - Safe? Yes, within bounds and no collision\n   - Moves toward (1, 5) apple\n   - This continues the path toward a nearby apple\n   - Good directional move\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Head moves to (5, 8)\n   - Safe? NO - (5, 8) is my first body segment\n   - This would kill me immediately\n   - ELIMINATE\n\n**Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT**\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs LEFT:**\n- DOWN toward (4, 2): Gets me closer to an apple at distance 6, moving down the middle column\n- LEFT toward (1, 5): Gets me closer to (1, 5) which is also distance ~6 from my current position\n\nLooking at (8, 7) - this is actually quite close (RIGHT 4, DOWN 1). However, I need to consider which apple I can realistically reach first.\n\nMoving DOWN keeps me in the middle of the board and makes progress toward (4, 2). This apple is directly below me (same x-coordinate), which is efficient.\n\nMoving LEFT moves me toward (1, 5), but I'm already moving in that general direction and DOWN is another good option.\n\nI think DOWN is the stronger move because:\n1. It moves me toward the (4, 2) apple which is directly aligned below me\n2. It keeps me away from edges\n3. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n4. The apple at (4, 2) is reachable without getting trapped\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue moving DOWN toward (4, 2). Once collected, reassess between (1, 5) and other apples. Need to be mindful of enemy snake position at (3, 5) - avoid getting cornered near the bottom left.\n\nDOWN",
