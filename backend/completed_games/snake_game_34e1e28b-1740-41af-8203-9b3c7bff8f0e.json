Its possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):\n  - UP: (7,7) - no apple.\n  - DOWN: (7,5) - no apple.\n  - LEFT: (6,6) - no apple.\n  - RIGHT: (8,6) - no apple.\n- No immediate threat from the enemy, but we should avoid moves that could lead to collisions in future turns.\n\n**Safe Moves:**\nAll four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe for now because:\n- No body segments yet (so no self-collision).\n- No other snakes are blocking any direction.\n- No apples are adjacent, so no immediate growth.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**\n1. **Avoid getting trapped**: Since the board is small, we should avoid moving into corners or dead-ends where we might get boxed in.\n2. **Prioritize apple collection**: The closest apples are at (3,4), (4,1), (7,3), (7,4), and (6,1). We should aim to reach these efficiently.\n3. **Avoid enemy paths**: The enemy is at (7,6). If we move toward (7,3) or (7,4), we might collide with the enemy if it moves toward us. We should try to avoid overlapping paths.\n4. **Expand body strategically**: Since we have no body yet, we can grow safely if we eat an apple. But since no apples are adjacent, we should move toward an apple while keeping options open.\n\n**Best Immediate Move:**\nSince no apples are adjacent, we should move toward the closest apple while keeping flexibility. The closest apple is at (3,4), which is 2 steps left and 0 steps up/down from (5,4). Moving LEFT to (4,4) is a good start because:\n- It moves us closer to the apple at (3,4).\n- It doesn\u2019t box us into a corner.\n- It keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s current position at (7,6).\n\n### **Future Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. **Turn 1**: Move LEFT to (4,4) to start heading toward (3,4).\n2. **Turn 2**: If at (4,4), move LEFT to (3,4) to eat the apple and grow. This will give us a body segment at (4,4).\n3. **Turn 3**: After eating the apple, we\u2019ll have a body at (4,4). We should then move toward the next closest apple, likely (4,1) or (6,1), while avoiding the enemy\u2019s path.\n\n### **Final Decision:**\nGiven the current state, the safest and most strategic move is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",
