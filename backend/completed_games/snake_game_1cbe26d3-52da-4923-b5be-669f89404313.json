Eliminate.\n   - DOWN: (5, 8) \u2013 safe, moves down one cell. This cell is not occupied by any snake. The enemy's head is at (1,7), which is not adjacent, so no immediate collision risk. This move keeps me away from the enemy and opens up paths to apples at (5,5) and (5,4).\n   - LEFT: (4, 9) \u2013 into my own body (death). Eliminate.\n   - RIGHT: (6, 9) \u2013 safe, moves right one cell. This cell is not occupied. The enemy's head is at (1,7), which is not adjacent, so no immediate collision risk. This move moves me toward the apple at (9,6) but may limit future options if the enemy moves toward me.\n\n3) Among safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT):\n   - DOWN: Moves to (5,8). This is safe and keeps me in a central position with multiple future options. It also moves me closer to the apples at (5,5) and (5,4) while avoiding the enemy.\n   - RIGHT: Moves to (6,9). This is safe but moves me toward the edge of the board, potentially limiting future options. It also moves me closer to the apple at (9,6), but the enemy could intercept or trap me in the corner.\n\n4) Long-term plan:\n   - Move DOWN to (5,8) to maintain flexibility and avoid the edge of the board.\n   - After moving down, reassess the board for the closest and safest apple. The apples at (5,5) and (5,4) are now closer and can be reached safely.\n   - Avoid moving into tight spaces or corners where the enemy could trap me.\n   - Monitor the enemy's potential moves and avoid head-on collisions.\n   - Prioritize staying alive and maintaining multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nDOWN",
