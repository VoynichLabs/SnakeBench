To clarify, the initial position is given as (5,7) with body at [(5,6)]. I'll assume the initial position is at (5,7), with body at [(5,6)].\n\n- The snake's head is at (5,7); last move was UP, moving from (5,6) to (5,7).\n\n- The enemy snake is at (7,9) with body at [(6,9)], so its head is at (6,9).\n\n- Apples are at (9,0), (9,2), (1,7), (0,9), and (4,8).\n\n- Walls are at coordinates 0-9 in both x and y; the board is 10x10.\n\n- Our current position: (5,7), with body [(5,6)].\n\n- The enemy's head: (6,9); its body at (6,9).\n\nOur last move was UP, so we moved from (5,6) to (5,7).

We want to avoid that for now.\n\n- To reach (6,9), we'd need to move up to (6,8) then to (6,9). Moving into (6,8) is safe; if we then move UP again, we arrive at (6,9), which is the enemy's head—deadly. So, we must avoid moving into (6,9) directly.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Moving UP to (5,8): safe, and advancing toward top apples without immediate danger.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,7): safe, but if we plan to reach (6,9), we need to move up first.\n\nGiven the current position, moving UP seems the safest choice to progress toward an apple (top near (4,8)) and avoid danger.\n\nNext turn strategy:\n\n- Continue moving toward the top apples.\n\n- Once we reach (5,8) or (4,8), consider heading toward (4,8) since it is on the same row and reachable.\n\n- Avoid moving into enemy snake's head at (6,9).\n\nConclusion:\n\nI will move UP again, as it's safe and strategic at this point.\n\n**Decided next move: UP**",

Actually, our current position is at (5,7), moving UP to (5,8). That puts us directly below the apple at (4,8). Alternatively, moving LEFT from (5,7) to (4,7) might move us directly onto (4,8) if we keep moving upward.\n\nBut initial move is UP to (5,8). That moves us closer to the apple at (4,8), which is on the same row but one column to the left. So, after the move UP, at (5,8), our next goal is to approach (4,8). \n\nNow check for dangers:\n\n- Is (5,8) safe? Yes, no walls or own body there. \n- Enemies: the head at (6,9), which is diagonally adjacent to (5,8). Moving forward in our current direction doesn't threaten collision.\n\n- Is there any immediate threat of collision? Not directly. Moving UP is a safe choice.\n\nNext turn, we can plan to move LEFT to get onto (4,8). For now, the immediate priority is to move safely upward toward the apple, then pivot to reach (4,8).\n\n**Next move decision:** UP.",

UP: Would take me to (8, 9) - safe move, no obstacles\n2. DOWN: Would take me to (8, 7) - safe move, no obstacles  \n3. LEFT: Would take me to (7, 8) - this is where my body is! DEATH (collision with myself)\n4. RIGHT: Would take me to (9, 8) - safe move, moves toward the right edge\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- The enemy snake moved UP to (5, 9), so they're now at the top row\n- There's an apple at (0, 9) on the same row as the enemy snake - they might go for it\n- The apple at (4, 8) is now directly below the enemy snake's body\n- I'm well-positioned to go after the apples at (9, 0) or (9, 2) on the right side\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 8) would put me at the right edge, giving me a good position to move down toward those apples\n\nI think RIGHT is the best choice because:\n1. It positions me perfectly to start moving down the right edge toward the apples at (9, 2) and (9, 0)\n2. It keeps maximum distance from the enemy snake\n3. The right side of the board seems less contested\n4. From (9, 8), I can easily move DOWN next turn to start collecting the bottom-right apples\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (9, 8), I'll move DOWN to start working my way toward the apples at (9, 2) and (9, 0).
