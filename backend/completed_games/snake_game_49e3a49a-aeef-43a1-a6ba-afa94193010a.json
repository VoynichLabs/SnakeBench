We are not here to play games, we are here to dominate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (0, 8). I'm in the top-left area.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 3). He's central, slightly lower/right.\n*   **Board:** 10x10. Lots of open space. Apples are scattered. We need to secure some early points and start positioning ourselves to box this dude in!\n\n**The Plan (Long-Term Strategy Note for the Future G.O.A.T.):**\nSince we are both length 1, it's a race for space and apples. We need to grab some quick perimeter apples to grow, then head inwards to cut off Snake #1. He looks like he's going for that (7, 3) apple or maybe the (6, 1) one, or heading up towards the center. I need to claim the top-left quadrant and then swing down.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 0:**\nMy current position is (0, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (0, 9):** Safe. There's an apple at (3, 9) but that's far. (0, 9) is open. This keeps me along the top edge.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 7):** Safe. Moves me towards an apple at (0, 2), but that feels a bit too cautious.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 8):** INSTANT DEATH! Off the board. NOPE.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 8):** Safe. Moves me directly towards the apple at (2, 8) and gives me good access to the (1, 7) one. This is aggressive and claims the horizontal space.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP or RIGHT are the best options.\n\n*   UP (0, 9): Gets me to the perimeter, safe, but doesn't immediately set up an apple grab.\n*   RIGHT (1, 8): Sets me up perfectly for the (2, 8) apple next turn, or the (1, 7) apple. It's an aggressive move towards the center of the top edge.\n\nConsidering the density of apples in the top-left corner, RIGHT seems like the optimal move to secure early growth and then use my length to start denying the enemy space. We need to be fast and efficient!\n\nLet's go RIGHT! We're coming for that top edge, chat! GET READY FOR THE FLANK! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Meanwhile, I'M already positioned closer to where they HAVE to go!\n\n**My Plan:**\n\ud83c\udfaf Grab that apple at (7, 3) RIGHT NOW\n\ud83c\udfaf Expand toward the enemy's territory \n\ud83c\udfaf Force them into corners where they can't escape\n\ud83c\udfaf Set up head-on collision opportunities when I have the score advantage\n\nRIGHT gives me the apple AND moves me toward the enemy's projected path!

We just moved to (1, 8), solidifying our position on the upper edge. Look at that! We're already looking dominant!\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (1, 8). Length 1.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (7, 3). Body at (6, 3). Length 2. **Wait, WHAT?!** Snake #1 already has one apple and is length 2! He moved from (6, 3) to (7, 3) and ate the apple at (7, 3)! He's already ahead! **We need to pick up the pace, chat! Scoreboard shows 1 apple for him, 0 for us. Unacceptable!**\n\n**Board Vision:**\nWe are in the top right. We have an apple at (2, 8) and (1, 7) nearby. Snake #1 is down near the middle, currently blocking the southern access to the central board. He's looking like he wants (8, 1) or maybe heads down towards (7, 2).\n\n**The Vibe Check:**\nWe need growth, FAST. The apple at (2, 8) is a huge priority, and (1, 7) right below us is a close second. We have the corner locked down, now we need to start expanding before he gets too long and cuts us off entirely!\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 1:**\n\nMy current position is (1, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Keeps me along the top wall. Not immediately an apple grab (nearest is (3, 9)). Too safe, not aggressive enough.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 7):** **APPLE!** (1, 7) has an apple. Safe, direct path to growth. This is a very strong option.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 8):** Safe. Moves away from the central board and keeps me away from apples. Retreat is not an option right now!\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 8):** **APPLE!** (2, 8) has an apple. Safe, direct path to growth. This secures the horizontal progression.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (H2H):**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 3). No way we can collide this turn, he's too far away. We can focus purely on optimization and growth.\n\n**Decision: (1, 7) vs (2, 8)**\n\nBoth moves lead to immediate growth (Apple). Which one sets us up better for the next turn?\n\n*   If I move **DOWN (1, 7)**:\n    *   I eat an apple. I become length 2.\n    *   Next turn, I could go: RIGHT (2, 7) or DOWN (1, 6). (2, 7) leads toward the center and the (3, 7) apple. (1, 6) leads down the side.\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT (2, 8)**:\n    *   I eat an apple. I become length 2.\n    *   Next turn, I could go: RIGHT (3, 8) (towards (3, 9) apple) or DOWN (2, 7) (towards (3, 7) apple). This keeps us elevated and gives us more lateral space to explore the dense top-center apples.\n\nMoving **RIGHT (2, 8)** feels slightly more proactive in securing the top area and positioning us for the (3, 7) apple down the line, or the (3, 9) apple. It keeps our axis of movement along the top edge, claiming that perimeter space before we swing down. We need to be the GOAT of the top half!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 2/3):**\nWe are going right to secure the (2, 8) apple. Next turn, we should evaluate moving down to (2, 7) to check out the central density, or continue right towards (3, 8) / (3, 9). Our priority is growth while maintaining open lines to press the attack against Snake #1, who is establishing himself lower. We need to cut the board in half.\n\nLet's grab that apple! We going RIGHT! **Are we ready to dominate, chat?!**\n\nRIGHT",

I'm at 1 apple, enemy at 0, and it's time to extend that lead and BOX HIM IN!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:\n\n**Me (Snake #1):**\n- Head: (7, 3) \ud83c\udfaf\n- Body: [(6, 3)] \n- Score: 1 apple\n\n**Enemy (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (1, 8) \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Body: none\n- Score: 0 apples\n\n**Board Position:**\nI'm currently in the CENTER-RIGHT area, while the enemy is trapped near the TOP-LEFT corner! This is BEAUTIFUL - I have so much more room to maneuver!\n\n## MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (7,3):\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (6,3)** - MY OWN BODY! Instant death. Not even an option.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (7,4)** - OPEN SPACE! Keeps me near center, multiple exit options available.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (7,2)** - OPEN SPACE! But moving down pushes me toward bottom edge.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (8,3)** - OPEN SPACE! Moves me more toward right edge.\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nThe enemy at (1,8) has limited mobility - they're basically funneled toward the bottom-right area of the board where I ALREADY AM! My current position gives me the perfect opportunity to:\n\n1. **DOMINATE THE CENTER** - Control the middle of the board\n2. **CUT OFF ESCAPE ROUTES** - Force the enemy into corners\n3. **SET UP HEAD-ON COLLISIONS** - When I have the score advantage (1-0), I WANT those head-ons!\n\n**UP to (7,4)** is the PERFECT move because:\n- \u2705 Keeps me in the central area where I can pressure from all angles\n- \u2705 Maintains maximum future mobility (LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP next turn)\n- \u2705 Positions me to intercept the enemy as they're forced downward\n- \u2705 Prevents getting boxed into corners myself\n\nThe enemy has no body yet, so they might try to grow quickly. But I ALREADY HAVE MY FIRST APPLE! I need to use that advantage to DOMINATE and CRUSH them!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n- Keep moving toward the enemy's projected path (bottom-right area)\n- Force them into corners with no escape\n- Maintain score advantage to win head-on collisions\n- Never let myself get trapped - always keep multiple escape routes\n\n## FINAL DECISION:\n\nLet's KEEP the pressure on and move UP into that central position! From there, I can control the flow of the game and force the enemy into situations they can't escape!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! UP!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** UP",

Time to press the advantage.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (2, 8). Length 2. Body at [(1, 8)].\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (7, 4). Length 2. Body at [(7, 3)].\n\nHe moved from (7, 3) to (7, 4) and grabbed the apple that was at (7, 4)! Sneaky! He's growing fast, too! This is going to be a knife fight, chat!\n\n**Board Vision:**\nWe are dominant in the top-left quadrant. We have potential apples at (3, 9), (4, 6), (3, 7), (1, 7).\nSnake #1 is centralized on the right side. He's got (8, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (7, 2) in his general vicinity. He's likely going to try and move towards (8, 6) or maybe (8, 5) if he's feeling adventurous.\n\n**The Strategy: Box Him In!**\nWe need to grow while simultaneously securing the central line (x=4/5) to prevent him from expanding into the vast open areas on the left half of the board. My priority is the apple at (3, 7) or (3, 9), as these allow for rapid horizontal and/or vertical expansion.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 2 (Head: (2, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 9):** Safe. No apple. Puts us in position for the (3, 9) apple next turn. Excellent positional move.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 7):** Safe. No apple. Puts us in an immediate position to grab (3, 7) or (4, 6) later. This leads to the crowded center.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 8):** **FATAL!** That is my body segment. Self-destruction is for the weak! ELIMINATED.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 8):** Safe. No apple. Puts us on a trajectory towards the top right corner and the (3, 9) apple. This is an excellent offensive position.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Keeps us on the top edge. Places us near the (3, 9) apple. What if the enemy goes crazy?\n    *   *Enemy Prediction:* Snake #1 is at (7, 4). He's likely moving (8, 4) or (7, 5). He is miles away. No immediate collision risk.\n    *   This move secures the top perimeter and sets up a diagonal cut down the board.\n\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Highest possible position. Great for claiming territory. Next move could be RIGHT (3, 9) to eat the apple. This is a guaranteed growth path.\n\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):** Pushes us into the central action. A little riskier, but gets us closer to the central apples (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n\n**Decision Time: Growth and Dominance!**\n\nThe UP move to (2, 9) is technically a guaranteed apple grab next turn (to (3, 9)), which is invaluable for continuous growth. However, moving RIGHT (3, 8) allows for more flexibility both horizontally (to (4, 8)) and vertically (to (3, 7) or (3, 9)). If we go RIGHT, we hit (3, 8) and can then pivot:\n1. UP to (3, 9) (Apple!)\n2. DOWN to (3, 7) (Apple!) (This is the crucial central apple)\n\nMoving to (3, 8) gives us two immediate apple options for Turn 3! This flexibility is exactly what we need to stay unpredictable and dominant. We claim ground and prepare to strike the vulnerable central apples.\n\nLet's claim that top perimeter, chat! We're moving RIGHT!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 3/4):**\nMove to (3, 8). On Turn 3, we must prioritize eating an apple. The (3, 7) apple is excellent for diving down to cut Snake #1 off, while the (3, 9) apple maintains our perimeter dominance. If he starts making moves towards the top, we take (3, 7) and slice him off. If he stays low, we take (3, 9) for guaranteed growth and then swing wide. Right now, we want the flexibility of (3, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

I'm feeling good about my position but let's analyze the current state before we make our move!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n\n**Me (Snake #1):**\n- Head: (7, 4) \ud83c\udfaf - Already executed that UP move from last turn!\n- Body: [(7, 3)] \n- Score: 1 apple \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Enemy (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (2, 8) \u26a0\ufe0f - They're stuck in TOP-LEFT corner!\n- Body: [(1, 8)]\n- Score: 1 apple - They're matching me but they're in a WORSE position!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nI'm DOMINATING the RIGHT side of the board while the enemy is trapped near the TOP-LEFT corner with limited escape routes! This is EXACTLY where I want them!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (7,4):\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (7,2)** - WAIT NO! My tail is at (7,3), not (7,2). Let me recheck the board...\n\nActually looking at row 3: \". A . . . . . T . .\" - the T is at position 7, so that's (7,3). My tail IS at (7,3), so (7,2) is OPEN. But moving DOWN pushes me toward the bottom edge, which could be dangerous long-term.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (6,4)** - OPEN SPACE! This is CENTER territory - keeps me away from edges and maintains maximum mobility!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (7,5)** - OPEN SPACE! Moves me upward toward enemy territory but could push me toward top edge.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)** - OPEN SPACE! Moves me more toward right edge.\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nThe enemy at (2,8) is in a TIGHT SPOT! They've got:\n- Left: Column 0/1 (board edge + their own body at (1,8))\n- Right: Open but leads toward MY position at (7,4)\n- Down: Available but funnels them into bottom area\n- Up: Board edge at row 9!\n\nThey basically HAVE to move toward the RIGHT or DOWN to escape their corner. Meanwhile I'M already positioned in the center-right area! This is PERFECT for boxing them in!\n\n**Why LEFT to (6,4) is the PLAY:**\n- \u2705 Keeps me CENTERED - maximum flexibility for future moves\n- \u2705 Maintains distance from edges - never get trapped in corners\n- \u2705 Positions me to intercept if enemy tries to escape rightward\n- \u2705 Multiple escape routes always available (LEFT, RIGHT, UP)\n- \u2705 Denies enemy space to maneuver\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8,4) would push me toward the edge too fast. UP to (7,5) is fine but not as central. DOWN to (7,2) is just bad positioning.\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n- **MAINTAIN CENTRAL CONTROL** - Stay in the middle where you can move ANY direction\n- **BOX THE ENEMY IN** - They have less space, force them toward corners\n- **PRESERVE SCORE ADVANTAGE** - We tied 1-1, need to pull ahead!\n- **AVOID EDGES** - Corners are death traps, stay mobile!\n- **SET UP HEAD-ON COLLISIONS** - If scores become unequal and we're heading toward each other, ENGAGE!\n\nThe enemy has body length of 2 while I only have length of 2 (head + 1 body). We're evenly matched in size but they're in a WORSE position. KEEP PRESSURING!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf FINAL DECISION:\n\nLet's maintain that CENTRAL DOMINANCE and move LEFT into the heart of the board! From there I can control the flow and force the enemy into situations they can't escape!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! LEFT!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We got that positional advantage by moving RIGHT to (3, 8)! **Are we ready to secure more ground, or are we ready to dominate the board?**\n\nTurn 3! Time to execute the next phase of the plan: securing the central apples and cutting off Snake #1.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head (ID 0):** (3, 8). Length 2. Body at [(2, 8)].\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 4). Length 2. Body at [(7, 4)].\n*   The enemy moved from (7, 4) to (6, 4). He's moving left! He\u2019s trying to consolidate the center and move towards the cluster of apples around (4, 5 / 4, 6). Sneaky, sneaky! We absolutely MUST intercept him or wall him off!\n\n**Board Vision:**\nWe are high up, dominating the top-left from (3, 8).\nThe enemy is centered on the bottom-right half. He's at (6, 4).\nKey apples for me: (3, 9) and (3, 7). The (3, 7) apple is critical for the cut-off strategy!\nKey apples for him: (4, 5), (4, 6), and then potentially (7, 2) or (8, 1). If he moves UP (6, 5), he's right in the line of the central apples.\n\n**The Strategy: The S-Curve Cut!**\nWe need to grow while moving DOWN to establish a horizontal wall, preferably along the y=6 or y=5 line, preventing him from expanding further left than x=4.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 3 (Head: (3, 8)):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):** Safe. APPLE! (3, 9) is right there! This is guaranteed growth and keeps me high. This puts us at (3, 9). I could then move LEFT to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 9).\n    *   *Pro:* Guaranteed growth, keeps us safe.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't immediately address the threat posed by Snake #1 moving toward the center (4, 5) or (4, 6).\n\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe. APPLE! (3, 7) is right there! This is guaranteed growth and immediately starts the descent towards the center. This is the cutting move!\n    *   *Pro:* Guaranteed growth, crucial for the \"Cut Off\" strategy, positions us near (4, 6) and (3, 5).\n    *   *Con:* Puts us closer to the enemy's potential future path, but currently, he's far away.\n\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):** **FATAL!** That is my body segment. We don't rewind, chat! ELIMINATED.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):** Safe. No apple. Puts us on a path to the apple at (8, 6) or (7, 8).\n    *   *Pro:* Maintains high ground flexibility.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't achieve growth this turn, and makes us irrelevant to the central conflict.\n\n**Decision Time: Growth AND Pressure!**\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe and involve eating an apple. This is beautiful!\n\nLet's look at the enemy (6, 4). What is he likely doing?\n*   He could go UP to (6, 5). Safe, good position for (4, 6) or (4, 5).\n*   He could go LEFT to (5, 4). Safe, pushing toward the center.\n*   He could go RIGHT to (7, 4) (his body segment). **FATAL!**\n*   He could go DOWN to (6, 3). Safe, but leads nowhere currently.\n\nIf he moves LEFT (5, 4) or UP (6, 5), he is setting up to consume the central board. If we move DOWN to (3, 7) and eat, we are now only 2 or 3 spaces away from him, and we can immediately threaten the area around (4, 6) and (4, 5). This aggressively forces him to change direction or risk being trapped by our body.\n\nTaking (3, 9) is \"safer\" and guarantees length, but it allows him to continue his central push unchallenged. Taking (3, 7) is aggressive, gives us length, and prepares the wall.\n\n**We are going aggressive!** We need to cut him off before he settles in. The (3, 7) Apple is the tool for the job. We'll eat it, grow to length 3, and then look to move LEFT to (2, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 7) to start the horizontal blockade.\n\nLet's dive, chat! We're building the great wall of Snake!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 4/5):**\nMove to (3, 7) and grow to length 3. Next turn, we will prioritize moving toward (4, 6) (Apple) via (4, 7), or if he is moving aggressively toward us, we will move (2, 7) to start walling off the left side of the board for ourselves. We must prevent him from using the x=4/5 corridor.\n\nDOWN",

Meanwhile the enemy is stuck up top with limited options. This is how you DOMINATE - control space, control apples, force errors!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf FINAL DECISION:\n\nLet's maintain that AGGRESSIVE POSITIONAL PLAY and move DOWN into territory where I can control the flow! From (6,3), I can swing left to collect apples or move up to pressure - maximum flexibility!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! DOWN!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

We secured that (3, 7) apple, grew to length 3, and now we are positioned perfectly to start the wall! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nTurn 4! Time to box this fool in! The board is getting aggressive.\n\n**Current State Analysis and Scoreboard Check:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (3, 7). Body [(3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 3. Score: 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (6, 3). Body [(6, 4)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n*   We have the lead! We have the length advantage! This is HUGE positional pressure.\n\n**Enemy Movement Review:**\nSnake #1 moved from (6, 4) to (6, 3).\n*   **Chat, did you see that?!** He bailed on the center! He saw us move into (3, 7) and realized his push for (4, 5) or (4, 6) was going to be contested. He decided to move DOWN to (6, 3), possibly targeting (7, 2) or (8, 1). He's turtling or attempting to expand on the bottom/right. This is exactly what we wanted! We have seized the central board control!\n\n**The Plan: Execute the Horizontal Wall and Center Dominance!**\nNow that the enemy has retreated south/east, we need to solidify our horizontal wall along y=7 and y=6, capturing the central cluster of apples and cutting him off from the vast open space to the left (x<3).\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 4 (Head: (3, 7)):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 8):** **FATAL!** That is my body segment. No clipping, chat!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Continues descent towards the central apples around y=5/y=6. Keeps pressuring the enemy.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't eat this turn, and makes it harder to immediately seize the key apple at (4, 7).\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Walls off the left side for us, securing safe movement. Starts widening our blockade to the left.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't eat this turn.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** Safe! APPLE! (4, 7) is right there!\n    *   *Pro:* **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** Puts our head at (4, 7), length 4, and positions us perfectly to move aggressively towards the cluster of apples at (4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5), and directly towards the enemy's potential path if he tries to push up again. This is pure aggression and growth! We will be dominating the y=7 line.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Always the most important!):**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 7). I am moving RIGHT to (4, 7).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (6, 3).\n\nWhat could he do?\n*   UP: (6, 4) (Safe, but his former body spot, now clear).\n*   DOWN: (6, 2) (Safe, moving to (7, 2) or (8, 1)).\n*   LEFT: (5, 3) (Safe, pushing left, possibly towards (3, 5)).\n*   RIGHT: (7, 3) (Safe, moving away).\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of a head-on collision or a body crash with my move (4, 7), which is 3 squares away from the enemy's closest potential spot (5, 3) or (6, 4).\n\n**Decision:** We take the growth, we establish the horizontal wall, and we move closer to the largest concentration of apples. We move RIGHT to (4, 7)! We secure the future!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 5/6):**\nMove to (4, 7) and grow to length 4. Next turn, we will prioritize (4, 6) (Apple) or (4, 5) (Apple) to maintain vertical cut-off pressure and keep growing, ensuring he cannot pass vertically on the x=4/x=5 line. We must use our length advantage to create an impenetrable wall and eventually force him into a losing position, likely near the bottom-right corner. It's time to trap him!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down where we stand and make the PERFECT move!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n\n**Me (Snake #1):**\n- Head: (6, 3) \ud83d\udcaa - Just moved DOWN last turn, maintaining that positional control!\n- Body: [(6, 4)] - Tail right above me, protecting my back\n- Score: 1 apple - We're DOWN by 1 point, need to EAT!\n\n**Enemy (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (3, 7) \u26a0\ufe0f - Still stuck in TOP-LEFT corner area\n- Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8)] - Tail at (2,8), they're length 3 now!\n- Score: 2 apples - They've got the lead, need to catch up!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (6,3):\n\nLet me check what's SAFE to move into:\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (6,4)** - Looking at row 4, position 6 is EMPTY. This is OPEN SPACE! But wait - that's where my own body is! If I move UP, I'd move into my body at (6,4). That's hitting myself = DEATH. NO GOOD!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (6,2)** - Looking at row 2, position 6 is EMPTY. This is OPEN SPACE!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (5,3)** - Looking at row 3, position 5 is EMPTY. This is OPEN SPACE!\n\n\u274c **RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)** - Looking at row 3, position 7 is EMPTY, but this moves me CLOSER to potential head-on collision zones. Not ideal but not deadly.\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**Why UP is DEADLY:**\n- (6,4) is currently occupied by my own body segment\n- Moving into my own body = instant death\n- This move is 100% OFF THE TABLE \u274c\n\n**My actual options:** DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- They're at (3,7) with body segments at (3,8) and (2,8)\n- They're basically trapped in the TOP-LEFT corner\n- Their tail at (2,8) blocks their left side\n- They can only really move RIGHT or DOWN without crashing into themselves\n- If they move RIGHT toward me, we could crash!\n\n**The HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nThe enemy is at (3,7). If they move RIGHT to (4,7), their head would be at (4,7).\n\nIf I move UP (6,4), I can't because my body is there. \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,3), and they move RIGHT to (4,7), we're NOT crashing - they're at x=4, I'm at x=7, we're far apart.\n\nBut what if the enemy makes a SURPRISE move and goes DOWN to (3,6)? Then they could potentially move RIGHT on subsequent turns toward me.\n\n**Why moving LEFT to (5,3) is the SMARTER PLAY:**\n- \u2705 Moves me AWAY from potential collision zones\n- \u2705 Gets me closer to BOTTOM-LEFT apples at (3,1), (1,3), and (6,1)\n- \u2705 Positions me to CONTROL the middle columns\n- \u2705 Creates SPACE between me and the enemy\n- \u2705 Multiple escape routes always available\n- \u2705 I'm heading toward apple-rich territory while enemy is stuck in corner\n- \u2705 This is how you DOMINATE - control space, control apples!\n\n**Why moving DOWN to (6,2) is OK but NOT IDEAL:**\n- Moves me further down toward apples\n- But it keeps me in column 6, closer to potential collision paths\n- Less strategic control of the middle board\n\n**Why moving RIGHT to (7,3) is RISKY:**\n- Moves me CLOSER to potential head-on zones\n- Less benefit strategically\n- Might pressure me toward the right edge\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n\nWe're currently DOWN by 1 point (1 vs 2). We need to:\n1. **COLLECT APPLES** - Get that score lead! Apples at (6,1), (3,1), (1,3), (7,2) are all reachable from my position!\n2. **MAINTAIN PRESSURE** - Keep them in their corner\n3. **EXPAND MY TERRITORY** - Take control of the center-right\n4. **AVOID STUPID DEATHS** - No head-on collisions when we're behind!\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,3), I'm perfectly positioned to:\n- Swing DOWN toward (6,1) apple\n- Move LEFT toward (3,1) and (1,3) apples\n- Swing back RIGHT if needed\n- Keep multiple escape routes open\n\nThe enemy is stuck in top-left. I'm FREE to roam and collect! This is the way!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf FINAL DECISION:\n\nLet's maintain that AGGRESSIVE POSITIONAL PLAY and move LEFT into territory where I can control the flow and access apples! From (5,3), I have maximum flexibility to chase apples or maneuver strategically!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! LEFT!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We secured that (4, 7) apple, grew to length 4, and now we are positioned perfectly to tighten the noose! LOOK AT THE MAP! \ud83d\udd25\n\nTurn 5! Time to execute the next phase of the trap!\n\n**Current State Analysis and Scoreboard Check:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (4, 7). Body [(3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 4. Score: 3.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (5, 3). Body [(6, 3)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n*   We have the LEAD! We have the length advantage! This is MEGA positional pressure. We own the upper left quadrant.\n\n**Enemy Movement Review:**\nSnake #1 moved from (6, 3) to (5, 3).\n*   **Chat, did you see that?!** He moved LEFT! He's trying to get back to the center of the board, likely targeting (4, 5) or (3, 5). He sees the cluster of apples there and knows he's falling behind. This is exactly where we want him\u2014cornered and scrambling!\n\n**The Plan: Dominate the Center Column (x=4) and Block the Ascent!**\nOur head is at (4, 7). We are poised to strike DOWN. If we move down, we secure the vertical strip and cut off his path UP the board unless he challenges our head directly, which is a major risk for a shorter snake.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 5 (Head: (4, 7)):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Expands into the upper right corner.\n    *   *Con:* Retreats from the action and removes pressure on the enemy who is moving central. We are abandoning the critical center-cut. Not aggressive enough!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 6):** Safe! APPLE! (4, 6) is right there!\n    *   *Pro:* **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** Puts our head at (4, 6), length 5! This is a massive move. It places us directly in the center, positioning us to eat (4, 5) next, and directly blocks Snake #1\u2019s easiest path to the upper half of the board.

No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Continues the horizontal wall.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't eat this turn. Lets him feel safer moving into the central column next turn.\n\n**The Golden Move is DOWN (4, 6)!** We grow, we dominate the column, and we secure the central nexus of apples!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial!):**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 7). I am moving DOWN to (4, 6).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (5, 3).\n\nWhat could he do?\n*   UP: (5, 4) (Safe. Moving closer to (4, 5)).\n*   DOWN: (5, 2) (Safe. Retreating).\n*   LEFT: (4, 3) (Safe. Moving towards (3, 1) or (3, 5)).\n*   RIGHT: (6, 3) (Safe. Moving back to his body's old spot).\n\nNo movement puts him close to (4, 6) this turn. The closest he can get is (4, 3) or (5, 4). We are completely safe. We are taking this apple, growing, and solidifying our choke-hold!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 6/7/8):**\nMove to (4, 6) and grow to length 5. Next turn, we will prioritize DOWN to (4, 5) (Apple) to maximize growth and fully cement the vertical barrier along x=4. Once we are large, we can loop back left to sweep up (3, 5) and (3, 9). Our goal is to cut him off entirely from the left side of the board and force him into the crowded bottom-right, where we can trap him against the wall or against our growing body.\n\nDOWN",

Looking at the board... (5,4) is clear!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (5,2)** - Row 2, position 5 is EMPTY. That's open space!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (4,3)** - Row 3, position 4 is EMPTY. This is CLEAR!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)** - Row 3, position 6 has my OWN BODY! If I move RIGHT, I'd move into my body segment at (6,3). That's hitting myself = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c RIGHT IS DEADLY!\n\n**So RIGHT is OFF THE TABLE!** Moving into my own body is the ultimate throw. No way Jos\u00e9!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**Why RIGHT is 100% DEADLY:**\n- My body is occupying (6,3) right now\n- Moving into my own body = instant elimination\n- This is the WORST possible play \u274c\n\n**The Remaining Options:** UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- They're stuck at (4,7) with body segments blocking their escape\n- Their tail at (2,8) and body at (3,8) prevent them from going left\n- They can move DOWN toward row 6, or RIGHT toward the center\n- They have 3 apples and are DOMINATING the scoreboard\n- I need to CHASE APPLES to catch up!\n\n**Where are the apples I can reach?**\n\nLooking at the board, I see some DELICIOUS options:\n- (4,5) and (3,5) are UP and LEFT from me\n- (6,1) and (3,1) are DOWN and LEFT\n- (7,2) is DOWN and RIGHT\n\nThe BOTTOM-LEFT area is RICH with apples! (0,0), (0,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) are all in that general region!\n\n**Why moving LEFT to (4,3) is ABSOLUTE FIRE:**\n- \u2705 Moves me toward the APPLE-RICH bottom-left quadrant\n- \u2705 Gets me CLOSER to (3,1), (1,3), (3,5), and (4,5) apples\n- \u2705 Maintains distance from the enemy (they're at y=7, I'd be at y=3)\n- \u2705 Keeps multiple escape routes OPEN\n- \u2705 Positions me to DOMINATE the left side of the board\n- \u2705 Creates pressure by controlling more territory\n- \u2705 Sets up future moves to trap the enemy\n\n**Why moving UP to (5,4) is RISKY:**\n- \u274c Moves me CLOSER to the enemy's y-level (they're at y=7)\n- \u274c Takes me AWAY from the apple-rich bottom area\n- \u274c Reduces my strategic options\n- \u274c Might lead to head-on collision zones\n\n**Why moving DOWN to (5,2) is MEH:**\n- \u2b1c Moves toward apples, but not optimally positioned\n- \u2b1c Less strategic control of the middle board\n- \u2b1c Not as many escape routes as LEFT offers\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n\nI'm DOWN BY 2 POINTS (1 vs 3). The playbook is clear:\n\n1. **EAT ALL THE APPLES** - The bottom-left has so many apples! (0,0), (0,2), (1,3), (3,1), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) - that's like 7 apples just waiting for me!\n\n2. **CONTROL THE BOARD** - By moving LEFT, I'm claiming territory and limiting the enemy's options\n\n3. **GROW STRONG** - The more I eat, the longer I get, the more I can box them in!\n\n4. **FORCE THE ERROR** - The more trapped they feel, the more likely they are to crash!\n\n**My PATH to VICTORY:**\n- Turn 5: LEFT to (4,3) \u2190 WE ARE HERE\n- Turn 6: LEFT to (3,3) or DOWN to (4,2)\n- Turn 7: Swing toward (3,1) or (4,5) apples\n- Collect 2-3 more apples to tie or LEAD\n- Then turn AGGRESSIVE and box them in!\n\n**Key Insight:** The enemy is stuck in top-left. I'm FREE to roam and collect! By moving LEFT, I'm going toward the apple motherland while they sit in their little corner with limited options. This is how you DOMINATE!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf FINAL DECISION:\n\nLEFT to (4,3) is the SMARTER PLAY. It moves me toward apples, maintains strategic distance from the enemy, keeps all my options open, and positions me to CONTROL the game!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! LEFT!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We are DOMINATING the central-vertical strip of the board! Can we get some Ws in the chat?! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (4, 6). Body [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 5. Score: 4!\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (4, 3). Body [(5, 3)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n\n**Enemy Movement Review (Turn 5 -> Turn 6):**\nSnake #1 moved from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n*   **He\u2019s moving LEFT!** He\u2019s scrambling for an apple in the lower-left quadrant (like (3, 1) or perhaps trying to loop around us for (3, 5)). He is now directly in the path of the x=4 column we are trying to lock down. This is the moment for the choke hold!\n\n**The Plan: Complete the x=4 Dominance and Execute the Trap!**\nI am at (4, 6). The next immediate apple is at (4, 5). Eating this apple increases our length to 6, securing the central column, and forcing Snake #1 to either:\n1.  Attempt a dangerous horizontal move to break out (e.g., UP to (4, 4) from (4, 3) if we move down\u2014a dangerous head-on if we both use x=4, or LEFT to (3, 3)).\n2.  Retreat into the restricted bottom area.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 6 (Head: (4, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 7):** **FATAL!** That is my body segment. No backwards moves, chat!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 5):** Safe! APPLE!\n    *   *Pro:* **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** Length 6! This is *critical*. It extends our massive vertical barrier, placing us just one square above Snake #1's head (4, 3). It completely cuts him off from the rich upper-left corner of the board. This is the aggressive, smothering move we need.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Starts moving towards the (3, 5) apple.\n    *   *Con:* Misses an immediate apple and abandons the central column dominance plan for two turns, giving the enemy a chance to slip past us or consolidate. Not worth it!\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Opens up the possibility of moving right/down to the (8, 6) apple eventually.\n    *   *Con:* Removes pressure, misses an apple, and is generally a tactical retreat from the main battleground.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial!):**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 6). I am moving DOWN to (4, 5).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (4, 3).\n\nWhat can Snake #1 do from (4, 3)?\n*   UP (4, 4): Safe. This is his most likely move if he is trying to get into the central apple cluster.\n*   DOWN (4, 2): Safe. Retreating.\n*   LEFT (3, 3): Safe. Moving towards the lower-left apples.\n*   RIGHT (5, 3): He just came from (5, 3) two turns ago, so it\u2019s safe, but less likely.\n\n**The beautiful thing about DOWN to (4, 5) is that it is safe regardless of his move!**\n*   If he moves UP to (4, 4), he blocks further descent, but we are still safe at (4, 5) with a bigger body.\n*   If he moves anything else, we are safe and own (4, 5).\n\nNo chance of a double or immediate head bump, because there is an empty square (4, 4) between us and him.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move is unequivocally DOWN. We are increasing our score, increasing our length, and cutting the board in half for a massive territorial advantage. Get cooked, Snake #1!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 7/8/9):**\nAfter moving to (4, 5) (length 6), we will assess Snake #1's position at (4, 4) or elsewhere.\n1. If he is at (4, 4), we look to move LEFT to (3, 5) (Apple) to secure the left-central region, potentially forcing him down, or we try to move RIGHT to (5, 5) to loop around and reinforce the chokehold from the right side of the x=4 column.\n2. If he moved away from the x=4 column (e.g., to (3, 3) or (5, 3)), we continue DOWN to (4, 4) to cement the barrier, looking to eat (3, 5) or the next available apple. We have to keep the pressure on and force him into a crash!\n\nDOWN",

We are absolutely STOMPING the central-vertical strip of the board! Can we get some Ws in the chat?! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (4, 5). Body [(4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 6. Score: 5!\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (3, 3). Body [(4, 3)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n\n**Enemy Movement Review (Turn 6 -> Turn 7):**\nSnake #1 moved from (4, 3) to (3, 3).\n*   **He\u2019s moving LEFT!** The opponent is realizing that the x=4 column is fully owned territory, and he\u2019s trying to slip past our blockade and grab the (3, 1) or (3, 5) apple or escape into the lower-left corner. We have him trapped! His length 2 body is now (3, 3) head, (4, 3) body.\n\n**The Plan: Enforce the Chokehold and Secure the (3, 5) Apple!**\nI am at (4, 5). We have successfully established a massive vertical wall. Now we need to move laterally to secure the open territory *behind* our wall\u2014specifically the (3, 5) apple\u2014and then continue to press down on the enemy!\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 7 (Head: (4, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP (4, 6):** **FATAL!** That is my body segment. No backwards moves, chat! We're not doing the classic fail!\n2.  **DOWN (4, 4):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Continues the vertical blockade, placing us right above the enemy's position (3, 3) or any potential move he makes on the x=4 column.\n    *   *Con:* Doesn't secure the immediate (3, 5) apple. If he moved to (3, 3) to go for (3, 5), staying at x=4 lets him get the apple first and grow, making the corner harder to lock down.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe! APPLE!\n    *   *Pro:* **GUARANTEED GROWTH!** Length 7! This is *massive*\u2014it allows us to lock down the corner and simultaneously place pressure on Snake #1 who is currently at (3, 3). We complete the 'L' shape of our massive body and restrict the board even more. This is the aggressive, territory-grabbing move we need!\n    *   *Con:* None, this is perfect.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 5):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Opens up the path toward the (8, 6) apple perhaps.\n    *   *Con:* A tactical retreat from the main conflict zone. We need to be aggressive now!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial!):**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 5). I am moving LEFT to (3, 5) (Apple!).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (3, 3).\n\nWhat can Snake #1 do from (3, 3)?\n*   UP (3, 4): Safe. This is his most likely move if he is aiming for the (3, 5) apple (our target!) or trying to bypass our wall.\n*   DOWN (3, 2): Safe. Retreating.\n*   LEFT (2, 3): Safe. Moving further into the low-x column.\n*   RIGHT (4, 3): He just came from (4, 3) two turns ago, but it is now his body's tail. If he moves right, his tail moves off (4, 3) and he moves onto (4, 3). Safe, but dangerous since he's re-entering the kill zone.\n\n**Scenario Analysis if I move LEFT to (3, 5):**\n1.  **If he moves UP to (3, 4):** Safe for both. I eat the apple at (3, 5). He is now trapped one square below me!\n2.  **If he moves DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe for both. I eat the apple. He is retreating.\n3.  **If he moves LEFT to (2, 3):** Safe for both. I eat the apple. He is trying to retreat into the corner.\n4.  **If he moves RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe for both. I eat the apple. He is trying to get around our southern tip (4, 4).\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of collision or crashing into him if I move LEFT to (3, 5). The space between (3, 5) and (3, 3) is too large (separated by (3, 4)). This is a 100% safe, high-reward move! We increase our lead to 6-1 apples and cut off his primary escape route.\n\n**Conclusion:** The move is unequivocally LEFT. We grow, we dominate, and we force Snake #1 into a death corner. Get cooked, Snake #1!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 8/9/10):**\nAfter eating the (3, 5) apple (length 7, head at (3, 5)), we will have truly walled off the center. Snake #1 is likely at (3, 4) or retreating. We will look to move DOWN to (3, 4) to seal the gap if he\u2019s not there, and then continue moving to (3, 2) or (4, 4), always pressing him further into the bottom-left quadrant. We have to maintain the pressure and ensure he has no space to move or grow.\n\nLEFT",

Looking at the board... that's CLEAR!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (3,2)** - Row 2, position 3 is EMPTY. That's open space!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)** - Row 3, position 2 is EMPTY. This is CLEAR!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)** - Row 3, position 4 has my OWN BODY! That's hitting myself = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c RIGHT IS DEADLY!\n\n**RIGHT IS OFF THE TABLE!** Moving into my own tail is the ultimate throw. No way Jos\u00e9!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- They're at (4,5) now - they've been moving around in that general area\n- From (4,5), they can move to: (3,5), (4,4), or (4,6) - but (4,6) has their own body!\n- Their tail at (2,8) and body segments create a WALL in the top-left quadrant\n- They have 5 apples and are absolutely DOMINATING the scoreboard\n- I need to CHASE APPLES hard to catch up!\n\n**Where are the apples I can reach?**\n\nLooking at the board, the BOTTOM-LEFT area is absolutely STACKED with apples! \n- (3,1) is RIGHT BELOW ME - that's like an easy freebie!\n- (1,3), (0,0), (0,2), (1,7), (2,1) - that's like 5+ apples just waiting for me!\n\n**Why moving DOWN to (3,2) is ABSOLUTE FIRE:**\n- \u2705 Moves me STRAIGHT TOWARD the apple at (3,1) - that's FREE POINTS!\n- \u2705 Gets me CLOSER to the APPLE-RICH bottom-left quadrant\n- \u2705 Maintains maximum distance from the enemy (they're at y=5, I'd be at y=2)\n- \u2705 Keeps MULTIPLE escape routes OPEN\n- \u2705 Positions me to DOMINATE the left side of the board\n- \u2705 Creates pressure by controlling more territory\n- \u2705 Sets up future moves to box the enemy in\n\n**Why moving LEFT to (2,3) is MEH:**\n- \u2b1c Also moves toward apples, but not as directly toward (3,1)\n- \u2b1c Still good positioning, but DOWN gives me immediate apple access\n\n**Why moving UP to (3,4) is NOT optimal:**\n- \u2b1c Moves me TOWARD the enemy's general area (they're at y=5)\n- \u2b1c Less optimal positioning toward the apple-rich zones\n- \u2b1c Reduces strategic flexibility and increases collision risk\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n\nI'm DOWN BY 4 POINTS (1 vs 5). The playbook is clear:\n\n1. **EAT ALL THE APPLES** - The bottom-left has so many apples! (3,1) is RIGHT THERE! I need to harvest them FAST!\n\n2. **CONTROL THE BOARD** - By moving DOWN, I'm claiming territory and limiting the enemy's options while staying SAFE\n\n3. **GROW STRONG** - The more I eat, the longer I get, the more I can box them in!\n\n4. **FORCE THE ERROR** - The more trapped they feel, the more likely they are to crash!\n\n**My PATH to VICTORY:**\n- Turn 7: DOWN to (3,2) \u2190 WE ARE HERE\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (3,1) \u2190 EAT THE APPLE! \ud83d\udcb0\n- Turn 9: Swing toward more apples in bottom-left\n- Collect 3-4 more apples to tie or LEAD\n- Then turn AGGRESSIVE and box them in!\n\n**Key Insight:** The enemy is stuck in top-left. I'm FREE to roam and collect! By moving DOWN, I'm going STRAIGHT toward the apple at (3,1) while they sit in their little corner with limited options. This is how you DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf FINAL DECISION:\n\nDOWN to (3,2) is the SMARTER PLAY. It moves me TOWARD an apple, maintains maximum strategic distance from the enemy, keeps all my options open, and positions me to CONTROL the game while getting FREE POINTS!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! DOWN!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n**Final Answer:** DOWN",

Our vertical wall is absolutely impenetrable! Snake #1 is cooked and he doesn't even know it yet! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (3, 5). Body [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 7. Score: 6!\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (3, 2). Body [(3, 3)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\n\n**Enemy Movement Review (Turn 7 -> Turn 8):**\nSnake #1 moved from (3, 3) to (3, 2).\n*   **He\u2019s moving DOWN!** The opponent is realizing that the entire top half of the board is ours and that the (3, 5) apple is gone. He is retreating hard into the bottom-left corner. This is exactly what we wanted! We have successfully pushed him out of the major lanes. Now we convert the spatial advantage into a kill!\n\n**The Plan: SEAL THE ESCAPE!**\nThe enemy is at (3, 2). We are at (3, 5). The critical path he needs to move through is (3, 4) and (3, 3). We need to move DOWN the column and restrict his movement options to the absolute minimum.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 8 (Head: (3, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Con:* A tactical retreat away from the enemy. We let him breathe and potentially explore the lower board. We must maintain pressure!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 4):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* **CRUCIAL ENFORCEMENT!** We move into the empty square (3, 4), directly above the (3, 3) square which he just vacated, and the (3, 2) square where he currently resides. We are cutting off his retreat route and sealing the '3' column. This confines him to the bottom-left corner, x < 3, and y < 3.\n    *   *Pro:* This move puts us right where we need to be for a follow-up move to (3, 3) or (4, 4) next turn.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. No apple.\n    *   *Pro:* Starts expanding into the left region.\n    *   *Con:* Still too far from the enemy. We are in kill phase, not expansion phase!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 5):** **FATAL!** That is the first segment of my body now! Classic backwards move. NOPE!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial!):**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 5). I am moving DOWN to (3, 4).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 1):** (3, 2).\n\nWhat can Snake #1 do from (3, 2)?\n*   UP (3, 3): Safe. If he moves up, he\u2019s moving right onto the square directly below me. Safe for both.\n*   DOWN (3, 1): Safe. (Apple at (3, 1)!) This is very likely.\n*   LEFT (2, 2): Safe. Retreating.\n*   RIGHT (4, 2): Safe. The territory is empty and he is escaping right.\n\nSince I am moving to (3, 4) and he is at (3, 2), there is a gap of (3, 3) between us. There is no risk of collision this turn, regardless of his move!\n\n**Scenario Analysis if I move DOWN to (3, 4):**\n1.  **If he moves DOWN to (3, 1) (Apple!):** Safe for both. He gets an apple, but he is now cornered at the very bottom.\n2.  **If he moves UP to (3, 3):** Safe for both. Now he is one square below me, and I am in perfect position to potentially move DOWN to (3, 3) (if he moves away next turn) or LEFT/RIGHT to seal the top.\n3.  **If he moves LEFT or RIGHT:** Safe for both. He is either escaping left or attempting to break through my lower flank.\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 4) is the only truly aggressive move that continues to box Snake #1 in. It seals off his access to the top half of the board permanently through the x=3 line and forces him into the smaller, less resource-rich quadrant.\n\nWe must maintain the chokehold! We are going for the kill, Chat!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 9/10/11):**\nAfter moving to (3, 4), Snake #1 will be at (3, 1) (likely, if he eats the apple) or (3, 3) or retreated (2, 2).\nOur next moves will be determined by his (likely) apple grab at (3, 1). If he goes there and grows, he is length 3, pinned against the bottom wall. We then move DOWN to (3, 3) (if clear) or DOWN/LEFT diagonally to push him exclusively into the (0, 0) - (2, 2) box. We need to cut off his access to the x=4 column and the bottom-right corner.\n\nDOWN",

Free points, content, LET'S GOOOO!\n- \u2705 Gets me CLOSER to the APPLE-RICH bottom-left corner\n- \u2705 After eating at (3,1), my body becomes [(3,2), (3,3)] - beautiful positioning!\n- \u2705 I can then swing LEFT toward (1,1), (0,0), (0,2) - MORE APPLES!\n- \u2705 Maximum distance from the enemy (they're at y=4-6, I'd be at y=1)\n- \u2705 This is AGGRESSIVE content gathering - WE NEED THOSE APPLES!\n\n### **OPTION 2: RIGHT to (4,2) \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50**\n- \u2705 Also SAFE, keeps me alive\n- \u2b1c Doesn't get me to an apple THIS turn\n- \u2b1c Moves me slightly toward the enemy (x=4 vs x=3)\n- \u2b1c Less direct path to the apple-rich zones\n- \u2b1c Not maximizing my potential this turn\n\n### **OPTION 3: LEFT to (2,2) \u2b50\u2b50**\n- \u2b1c Also SAFE, but what's the point?\n- \u2b1c Doesn't get me to an apple\n- \u2b1c Dead-end potential if I keep going left\n- \u2b1c Why zigzag when I can go STRAIGHT TO THE APPLE?!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY - THE PATH TO VICTORY:\n\nI'm DOWN BY 5 POINTS (1 vs 6). We need a SERIOUS apple hunting strategy!\n\n**MY GAME PLAN:**\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (3,1) \u2190 EAT THE APPLE! \ud83d\udcb0\n- Turn 9: LEFT to (2,1) \u2190 More apple territory!\n- Turn 10: LEFT to (1,1) \u2190 Swing toward bottom-left cluster!\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (1,0) or LEFT to (0,1) \u2190 CLEAN UP THOSE APPLES!\n- Collect 4-5 more apples to TIE or LEAD\n- Then turn AGGRESSIVE and start boxing them in!\n\n**Key Insight:** The enemy is TRAPPED in top-left with limited mobility. They can't go right or left from their current position! Meanwhile, the BOTTOM-LEFT is absolutely STACKED with apples at (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (3,1), (6,1), (7,1), (9,1)! That's like 7+ apples just waiting for me!\n\nBy moving DOWN to (3,1), I'm going STRAIGHT toward the content zone while they're stuck playing defense in their little corner. This is how you CLUTCH a comeback! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n## \ud83c\udfc1 FINAL DECISION:\n\nDOWN to (3,1) is the ONLY play that makes sense. It gets me:\n- \u2705 IMMEDIATE APPLE +1 POINT\n- \u2705 Better positioning for future apple hunting\n- \u2705 Maximum distance from the enemy\n- \u2705 Opens up the entire bottom-left quadrant for DOMINATION\n- \u2705 Content for the chat!\n\nRIGHT is okay but doesn't maximize this turn. LEFT is just inefficient. UP is suicide!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO! EAT THAT APPLE!** \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Final Answer:** DOWN",

Can we get some Fs in the chat for our opponent\u2019s incoming demise?!\n\nSCOREBOARD check: 6 apples to 2! We are DOMINATING! Length 7 vs Length 4 (Snake #1 just picked up an apple, I bet).\n\n**Current Board State/Coordinates Review (Turn 9 Start):**\n\nOur Move (Turn 8): DOWN from (3, 5) to (3, 4).\n*   **Your Snake (ID 0):** Head (3, 4). Body: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (2, 8)]. Length 7.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Let's look at the board... His body went from [(3, 2), (3, 3)] to **[(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2)]** Wait, that can't be right. Let's re-read the input for Snake #1's current state.\n\n*   Opponents: Snake #1 - Head: (3, 1), Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)], Apples: 2\n\nOkay, Snake #1 moved from (3, 2) to (3, 1) and ate an apple! He is now length 4! (3, 1) Head, Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]. **Wait**, if he ate an apple at (3, 1), his body should be 4 segments, since his previous body was [(3, 2), (3, 3)] (length 3 before the apple). The input says his body is [(3, 2), (3, 3)] (length 3). Let's trust the body list provided, which means he is Length 3 (Head at (3, 1), Body at (3, 2), (3, 3)). So he didn't grow yet, but he is certainly at (3, 1).\n\n*   **Enemy's Position:** Head (3, 1). Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3)]. Length 4. He is pinned against the bottom wall, right below me.\n\n**The Board Visualization:**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . T . . . A . A\n 7 . A . T T . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T . . . A .\n 5 . A . T T . . . . .\n 4 . . . 0 . . . . . . <--- YOUR HEAD (3, 4)\n 3 . A . T . . . . . A\n 2 A . . T . . . A . .\n 1 . . A 1 . . A . A . <--- ENEMY HEAD (3, 1)\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWe are at (3, 4). He is at (3, 1). The square (3, 3) and (3, 2) are his body segments. The square (3, 3) is his tail. The square (3, 2) is the middle segment.\n\n**The KILL PLAN: Box the Corner!**\n\nSnake #1's options from (3, 1):\n1.  **UP (3, 2):** **FATAL!** He crashes into his own body segment! He cannot move up.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 0):** Safe. No apple. Pins him further into the corner, which would be excellent.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 1):** Safe. Apple at (2, 1)! This is his best escape route. He's going to go left to (2, 1) and get that apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 1):** Safe. No apple. He might feel confident breaking right, but it's empty space.\n\nHe MUST go LEFT to (2, 1) to eat the apple and give himself some lateral movement options. We need to cut off his access to the rest of the board.\n\n**My Move Options from (3, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 5):** **FATAL!** Crash into my own body, (3, 5). NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 3):**\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* Safe. (3, 3) is currently held by *Snake #1's tail*.\n    *   *Head-on Check:* We move to (3, 3). Snake #1 moves to (2, 1) (likely) or (3, 0) or (4, 1).\n    *   *Body Collision Check:* If we move to (3, 3), is Snake #1's tail (which is (3, 3)) moving? **Crucial!** If a snake does *not* eat an apple, its tail moves forward one space to where the head was last turn. If a snake *does* eat an apple, the tail stays put.\n        *   Snake #1 *did* eat an apple at (3, 1), since he is now length 4. (Wait, let's assume the provided body list is correct and he is length 4: Head (3, 1), Body [(3, 2), (3, 3)], and the final segment is the tail. Wait, if he is length 4, his body list must have 3 segments. The given list has 2 segments. Let's assume the body list is correct: Length 3, Head (3, 1), Body [(3, 2), (3, 3)]. *If he collected an apple on the previous move (to (3, 1)), he should be length 4. The provided data is slightly inconsistent, but we must use it.*\n        *   **ASSUMPTION:** Snake #1 is length 4 (Head at (3, 1), Body [(3, 2), (3, 3), TAIL_PREVIOUS] but the visual queue shows T at (3, 3) and (3, 2)). Since we know he ate the (3, 1) apple, his tail **will not move** this turn. Therefore, the body segment at (3, 3) will stay at (3, 3).\n        *   **CONCLUSION:** **Moving DOWN to (3, 3) is a crash into Snake #1's body!** This kills us! We cannot move down!\n\n3.  **LEFT (2, 4):** Safe. Excellent movement into the open left-mid board.\n    *   *Pro:* Starts flanking Snake #1. We can potentially cut off escape if he runs toward (0, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 4):** Safe. Excellent movement.\n    *   *Pro:* Maintains a high position and allows us to swing DOWN the x=4 column to cut off any potential cross-board retreat by Snake #1. This also maintains the threat on the (3, X) column.\n\n**Aggression vs. Safety:**\n\nWe needed to assess the risk of moving DOWN. Since Snake #1 ate the apple (to reach (3, 1)), his tail, (3, 3) or (3, 2), STAYS PUT. Moving to (3, 3) would kill us. We cannot commit to a vertical kill right now.\n\nWe must contain him. His likely move is LEFT to (2, 1) for the apple. This puts him in the extremely limited 3x3 square at the bottom-left.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 4):\n*   We threaten the (4, 3) and (4, 2) lanes, which are currently open.\n*   We force him to stay contained in the x <= 3 region.\n*   We set up a perfect move next turn to either (4, 3) or (5, 4).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 4):\n*   We are closer to (1, 7) and (0, 0) apples for later.\n*   We are also cutting off the top-left section from him.\n*   We set up a move next turn to (2, 3) or (1, 4).\n\nWe have an immense lead (6-2). We don't need to chase apples violently. We need to complete the wall.\n\nMoving **RIGHT (4, 4)** seems more effective for maintaining the pressure from above, while setting up a diagonal sweep to block the bottom-right escape, *if* he escapes right. However, if he moves LEFT to (2, 1), blocking him OFF from the center is paramount.\n\nLet's anticipate his movements if he goes for the (2, 1) apple:\n*   He's at (2, 1), length 5. Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)].\n\nIf we move LEFT to (2, 4):\n*   Next turn, we can move DOWN to (2, 3). This is crucial! With us at (2, 3), Snake #1 is completely contained within the 3x3 box (0,0) to (2, 2). This is the perfect box-in maneuver.\n\nLet\u2019s go LEFT and execute the containment protocol. We are building the wall, Chat! Get HYPE!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 10/11):**\nMove LEFT to (2, 4) to prepare to move to (2, 3) on Turn 10. This position is vital to force Snake #1 into the bottom-left 3x3 kill box, cutting off his vertical escape and forcing him to crash into the walls or his own (growing) body. This strategy maintains pressure and limits his options dramatically. We are prioritizing the kill over score padding for the next two turns.\n\nLEFT",

Can we get a \"WALL-E\" in the chat?!\n\nSCORECHECK: 6-2. We are dominant. Length 7 vs Length 4. Time to finish the job!\n\n### **Turn 10: The Kill Shot Setup**\n\n**Current State Review (Start of Turn 10):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head (2, 4). Body: [(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7)]. Length 7. (See board: 0 at (2, 4), T's at (3, 4) and (3, 5), etc.)\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (4, 1). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2)]. Length 3 (Wait, the data still says length 3 body segments! Let's trust the input list!) Apples: 2.\n\n**Wait, enemy's new position!**\nThe enemy was at (3, 1) last turn.\nThe current input says Snake #1 Head is (4, 1).\n*Whaaaaaat?!* The enemy moved **RIGHT** from (3, 1) to (4, 1)! He ignored the free apple at (2, 1)! He ducked out of the corner! That's a major misplay by him, but now we have to react! He is now at (4, 1), body [(3, 1), (3, 2)].\n\n**Board State Re-Assessment:**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 . A . T T . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T . . . A .\n 5 . A . T T . . . . .\n 4 . . 0 T . . . . . . <--- YOUR HEAD (2, 4)\n 3 . A . T . . . . . A\n 2 A . . . . . . A . .\n 1 . . A T 1 . A . A . <--- ENEMY HEAD (4, 1)\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (4, 1). He is directly below the center mass of our body, which is at (4, 5) and (4, 6). He is trying to bypass us.\n\n**Snake #1's Options from (4, 1):**\n1.  **UP (4, 2):** Safe space. No apple.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 0):** Safe space. No apple.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 1):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!** He cannot move left.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 1):** Safe space. Right next to an apple at (6, 1).\n\nHe will likely move **RIGHT to (5, 1)** to immediately position for the apple at (6, 1), or he may move **UP to (4, 2)** to try and climb the board. If he goes up, he's still contained between the x=3 body wall and the x=5 open space.\n\n**Our Snake Move Options from (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** Safe. Leaves open the containment line.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe. THIS IS THE CONTAINMENT MOVE! If executed now, we cut off his access to the entire left side of the board for good.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** Safe. Retreating slightly, but getting closer to the (1, 5) apple. Less aggressive.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** **FATAL!** Crash into our own body segment. NOPE!\n\nThe moment is NOW, Chat! We need to shut off the left side, regardless of where he goes. Moving to (2, 3) effectively builds the permanent wall we planned.\n\n*   If he moves $\\rightarrow$ (5, 1): We move $\\downarrow$ (2, 3). We have successfully blocked off the entire x=0, x=1, x=2 areas below y=3. He is forced to contend with our tail or the right side.\n*   If he moves $\\uparrow$ (4, 2): We move $\\downarrow$ (2, 3). We are well positioned to drop further down the (2, X) column and completely enclose the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nMoving to (2, 3) is a strategic choke point. It allows subsequent moves to (1, 3) or (2, 2) to dominate the bottom of the board completely and isolate Snake #1 to the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Executing the Kill Box:**\nMove DOWN to (2, 3). This is the wall closing mechanism. We're not worried about apples right now; we're worried about the W.\n\n**Potential Head-on Collision Check (4, 1) to (2, 3):**\n*   He is at (4, 1). We are at (2, 4). No immediate danger of a head-on collision.\n\nLet's do this! We wall him in, and then we wait for him to panic.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 11/12):**\nMove to (2, 3) to solidify the wall. On Turn 11, aim to move to (2, 2) or (1, 3) to continue minimizing his maneuver space. We want to force him into a collision with his own growing body or the wall. If he retreats right, we continue to extend our body south to dominate the bottom half of the map. No Mercy!\n\nDOWN",

My body is at (3,1) and (3,2), so (4,2) is clear. No enemy body there either. SAFE! \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (4,0)** - OFF THE BOARD! That's y=0 which doesn't exist when moving down from y=1! \u274c DOWN IS DEATH!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (3,1)** - That's where MY BODY IS! That's hitting myself = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c LEFT IS OUT!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (5,1)** - Row 1, position 5 is EMPTY! No bodies there. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**So I have TWO safe moves: UP to (4,2) or RIGHT to (5,1)!** \n\nNow I need to decide which is STRATEGICALLY BETTER!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 ENEMY PREDICTION - WHERE THEY GONNA GO?\n\nEnemy is at (2,4). Their body is [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7)].\n\nFrom (2,4), they can go:\n- **UP \u2192 (2,3)** - Empty! \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,5)** - Empty! \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,4)** - Empty! \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)** - That's THEIR OWN BODY at (3,4)! DEATH! \u274c\n\nSo they have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. They cannot go RIGHT because of their own body.\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** They're at x=2, I'm at x=4. There's space between us, but if they move RIGHT to (3,4), they'd be moving LEFT TOWARD me... wait no, they CAN'T move right to (3,4) because that's their own body! So they're trapped on the left side of the board!\n\nThis means they WON'T be able to reach me easily. They're essentially boxed in on the left side while I have the freedom to move RIGHT toward the apple cluster!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC SHOWDOWN: UP vs RIGHT\n\n### **OPTION 1: UP to (4,2)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Safety** - Keeps me at x=4, further from enemy at x=2\n\n\u2705 **Escape routes** - From (4,2), I could go:\n- RIGHT to (5,2) - Open!\n- LEFT to (3,2) - That's my body! TRAP!\n- UP to (4,3) - Open!\n- DOWN to (4,1) - Back where I came from\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Problem**: LEFT is blocked by my own body! This limits my options!\n\n### **OPTION 2: RIGHT to (5,1)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **APPLE PATH** - Moving RIGHT to (5,1) gets me CLOSER to the apple cluster at:\n- (6,1) - Just 1 move away!\n- (8,1) - 3 moves away!\n- (9,1) - 4 moves away!\n\n\u2705 **More open space** - Moving right puts me in the open bottom-right area with MORE freedom to maneuver\n\n\u2705 **Escape routes** - From (5,1), I could go:\n- RIGHT to (6,1) - TOWARD THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- UP to (5,2) - Open!\n- LEFT to (4,1) - Back where I came from\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0) - OFF BOARD! Don't do that!\n\n\u2705 **Enemy separation** - I'm already 2 spaces away from enemy at x=2. Moving to x=5 increases that gap to 3 spaces!\n\n\u2705 **NO SELF-TRAP** - Unlike UP, moving RIGHT doesn't create any dead-ends or traps with my body!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY - HUNT AND GATHER!\n\n**THE PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (5,1), then keep hunting apples in the bottom-right!\n\n**Turn 10:** RIGHT to (5,1) \ud83c\udfaf\n**Turn 11:** RIGHT to (6,1) \u2192 EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83d\udcb0\n**Turn 12:** RIGHT to (7,1) \u2192 Keep moving toward (8,1) and (9,1)!\n**Turn 13:** RIGHT to (8,1) \u2192 EAT! \ud83d\udcb0\n**Turn 14:** RIGHT to (9,1) \u2192 EAT! \ud83d\udcb0\n**Turn 15:** UP to (9,2) or DOWN to (9,0) - Explore new territory!\n\n**SCORING POTENTIAL:** If I hit all those apples at (6,1), (8,1), (9,1), that's +3 apples in just a few turns! That closes the gap significantly!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:** They're trapped on the left side with limited mobility. They have to work their way around their own body just to move, while I have a CLEAR HIGHWAY to apple town!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc1 FINAL DECISION:\n\n**RIGHT to (5,1)** is the play! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS FIRE:**\n1. \u2705 **APPLES!** Moving right gets me closer to multiple apples in the bottom-right\n2. \u2705 **OPEN SPACE!** More room to maneuver and avoid getting trapped\n3. \u2705 **NO SELF-HAZARD!** Unlike UP, I'm not creating any dead-ends\n4. \u2705 **ENEMY DISTANCE!** Already 2 spaces away, this makes it 3\n5. \u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY!** From (5,1), I have multiple safe escape routes\n\nUP would be safe too, but it limits my leftward movement and doesn't get me closer to the apple cluster. RIGHT opens up the ENTIRE bottom-right quadrant for hunting!\n\n**LET'S GET THIS BREAD!** \ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf5e\n\n\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0 LET'S GOOOOO! HUNT AND GATHER! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Final Answer:** RIGHT",

Time for the clean up!\n\n### **Turn 11: The Rat Trap**\n\n**Current State Review (Start of Turn 11):**\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head (2, 3). Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. Length 7. We are the gatekeeper!\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (5, 1). Body: [(4, 1), (3, 1)]. Length 4. He moved RIGHT, directly toward the (6, 1) apple!

His safe space is shrinking fast.\n\n**Snake #1's Options from (5, 1):**\n1.  **UP (5, 2):** Safe space. No apple.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 0):** Safe space. No apple.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 1):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!** He cannot move left.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 1):** Safe space. EATS the apple! This is his most likely move.\n\n**Crucial Insight:** If he moves RIGHT to (6, 1), he will grow and his body segment at (3, 1) will remain on the board (at least for one more turn). He will become a length 5 snake, with head at (6, 1) and tail at (3, 1).\n\n**Our Snake Move Options from (2, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!** NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Safe. Continues the wall construction, heading for the (0, 2) apple (which gives us growth and further dominance). This is a strong, aggressive move.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the (1, 3) apple. Also solidifies the lower-left corner containment.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the enemy's general area, positions us above his potential movement path (x=4 to x=6).\n\n**Aggressive Containment Analysis:**\n\nWe are at (2, 3). We need to shrink his world.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (2, 2).** This establishes a complete wall barrier from the left edge of the board to x=2, below y=3. It targets the (0, 2) apple for growth. This is the optimal containment move. It forces him to continue moving right.\n    *   If he moves to (6, 1) [Apple]: He grows. We grow next turn if we hit an apple.\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (1, 3).** This forces us toward the (1, 3) apple. It is safe, but slightly less effective at immediately shrinking the right-side gap where he is operating.\n\n*   **Option 4: RIGHT to (3, 3).** This puts us on the x=3 column, potentially setting up a cut-off at x=4 or x=5. However, it pulls us away from the safety of the left wall and might allow him maneuvering space below us. It's risky because he could potentially go UP to (5, 2) or (4, 2) and try to squeeze between our body segments at x=3 or x=4.\n\n**The Decision: DOWN (2, 2)**\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 2) is the most efficient way to seal the deal on the entire bottom-left quadrant. We are building the perimeter, and by heading down, we get ready to eat the apple at (0, 2) next turn, which boosts our length and makes our body a more formidable barrier. We are forcing him to fight over the space [x=4, x=9] and [y=0, y=3] where he will quickly run out of room.\n\nWe are so far ahead on score and length that our main priority is board control and enemy trapping. Move DOWN and solidify the fortress!\n\n**Potential Head-on Collision Check (5, 1) to (2, 2):**\n*   He is at (5, 1). We are at (2, 3). No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nLet's drop the hammer! Wall-E initiation: Phase 2.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 12/13):**\nMove to (2, 2) (DOWN). Next turn, move LEFT to (1, 2) or DOWN to (2, 1) to eat the (0, 2) or (2, 1) apples and completely dominate the bottom-left corner. We continue to increase our length, forcing the enemy to decide between crashing into his own growing body or crashing into our massive wall. He has nowhere safe to go. We are the apex predator!\n\nDOWN",

That's y=0 which doesn't exist when moving down from y=1! \u274c DOWN IS DEATH!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (4,1)** - That's where MY BODY IS! That's hitting myself = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c LEFT IS OUT!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (6,1)** - Row 1, position 6. There's an apple there! But let me check for bodies... No bodies at (6,1)! SAFE! \u2705\n\n**So I have TWO safe moves: UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1)!**\n\nNow I need to decide which is STRATEGICALLY BETTER!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 ENEMY PREDICTION - WHERE THEY GONNA GO?\n\nEnemy is at (2,3). Their body is [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)].\n\nFrom (2,3), they can go:\n- **UP \u2192 (2,4)** - That's THEIR OWN BODY at (2,4)!

They cannot go UP because of their own body at (2,4).\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** If they go RIGHT to (3,3), they're getting CLOSER to me! I'm at x=5, they'd be at x=3 - that's only 2 spaces away!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC SHOWDOWN: UP vs RIGHT\n\n### **OPTION 1: UP to (5,2)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Safety from collision** - If enemy moves RIGHT to (3,3), I'm still 2 spaces away. No head-on risk!\n\n\u2705 **Open space** - (5,2) is in the open middle area with room to maneuver\n\n\u2705 **Escape routes** - From (5,2), I could go:\n- RIGHT to (6,1) - TOWARD THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT to (4,2) - Open!\n- UP to (5,3) - Open!\n- DOWN to (5,1) - Back where I came from\n\n\u2705 **Future flexibility** - UP keeps all my options open without rushing toward potential danger\n\n### **OPTION 2: RIGHT to (6,1)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **APPLE!** - There's an apple at (6,1)!

Still 3 spaces apart.\n\nHmm, that's not THAT dangerous. But here's the thing - if I go RIGHT and they go RIGHT, they could keep coming and I'd be forced to keep moving right or go UP into tighter space.\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY - PATIENCE IS KEY!\n\n**THE PLAN:** Move UP to (5,2), then assess the situation. This gives me flexibility and avoids any rushed decisions!\n\n**Turn 11:** UP to (5,2) \ud83c\udfaf\n**Turn 12:** If enemy moved away from me, I can go RIGHT to (6,1) and EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 13:** Keep hunting apples in the bottom-right while keeping an eye on enemy position\n**Long-term:** Close the 4-apple gap while avoiding head-on collisions!\n\n**STRATEGIC BENEFITS OF UP:**\n1. \u2705 **No collision risk** - Maintains safe distance from enemy\n2. \u2705 **All escape routes open** - Can go ANY direction except DOWN (off board)\n3. \u2705 **Positions me near apple cluster** - (6,1), (8,1), (9,1) still reachable!\n4. \u2705 **Reactive play** - Lets me see where enemy moves before committing to apple path\n5. \u2705 **Keeps them guessing** - I'm not predictable by rushing straight for apples\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf FINAL DECISION:\n\n**UP to (5,2)** is the play! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY UP IS FIRE:**\n1. \u2705 **SAFE FIRST!** No chance of head-on collision with aggressive move\n2. \u2705 **FLEXIBILITY!** All escape routes remain open\n3. \u2705 **APPLE STILL THERE!** (6,1) apple will still be there next turn\n4. \u2705 **STRATEGIC POSITIONING!** Gets me into open middle area\n5. \u2705 **ENEMY READ!** I can see where they move before committing\n\nRIGHT would get me an apple, but UP sets me up for LONG-TERM SUCCESS! I need to be patient and avoid getting baited into a collision while I'm down 4 apples!\n\n**LET'S PLAY SMART AND TAKE OVER!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd25\n\n\ud83d\udc0d LET'S GOOOOO!

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! That last turn was pure dominance! We moved DOWN to (2, 2) and sealed the lower-left flank. Snake #1 is officially in the danger zone. Are you ready for the FINISHING MOVE?! Let's check the board state and end this man's career!\n\nSCORECHECK: 6-2. Our length is 7 (wow!), his is 4 (pathetic!). We are monsters!\n\n### **Turn 12: The Squeeze**\n\n**Current State Review (Start of Turn 12):**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head (2, 2). Body: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)]. Length 7. We are in prime position to crush him!\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (5, 2). Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1)]. Length 4. WOW! He moved UP, ignoring the apple at (6, 1)? Interesting. He's clearly seeking escape!\n\n**Board State Re-Assessment:** (Updating based on the board provided, which shows the *current* state before the move)\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 . A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . T . . . A .\n 5 . A . T T . . . . .\n 4 . . T T . . . . . .\n 3 . A T . . . . . . A\n 2 A . 0 . . 1 . A . . <--- YOUR HEAD (2, 2) and ENEMY HEAD (5, 2)!\n 1 . . A . T T A . A .\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, I think I misread the board state in the setup! Let's re-verify the input board state:\n\n*   **Your Head:** (2, 2)\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #1):** (5, 2)\n\nThis means my prediction in the last turn analysis was actually WRONG about his move! He must have gone UP from (5, 1) to (5, 2). This changes the game! He ignored free score and growth to seek high ground.\n\n**Snake #1's Options from (5, 2):**\nHe is totally cornered below the y=5 line and between our body (x=4) and the right wall!\n\n1.  **UP (5, 3):** Safe space. No apple.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 1):** Safe space. Enters his own body! **FATAL!** He cannot move DOWN. This is huge!\n3.  **LEFT (4, 2):** CRASH! Into our body segment at (4, ?) or (3,?)? Our trail is [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (**3, 5**), (**4, 5**), (**4, 6**)]. Wait, his move to (4, 2) is SAFE. But look above him! Our body is at (3, 4) and (4, 5). He has almost nowhere to go.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 2):** Safe space. No apple.\n\n**Crucial Insight:** Snake #1 is length 4, and his body is [(5, 1), (4, 1)]. He is boxed in! His only lateral movement at y=2 is RIGHT to (6, 2) OR LEFT to (4, 2). He *cannot* move DOWN.\n\n**Our Snake Move Options from (2, 2):**\n\nWe need to close the gap. We are perfectly positioned to cut him off from the rest of the board.\n\n1.  **UP (2, 3):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!** NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (2, 1):** Safe. EATS the apple! BIG growth move, solidifying the bottom blockade.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the (0, 2) apple for growth. Solidifies the left blockade.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 2):** Safe. A direct pressure move! This puts us one step closer to cutting him off completely above the x=4 line or forcing a confrontation.\n\n**Aggressive Containment Analysis:**\n\nLook at the space he occupies: x=5, y=2. We are at x=2, y=2. We need to occupy the squares he needs to survive.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (2, 1). (EAT APPLE)**\n    *   Pro: We grow! Length 8. His space shrinks dramatically.\n    *   Con: We move away from him, potentially giving him a turn to escape UP to (5, 3) and then maybe to the right.\n\n*   **Option 4: RIGHT to (3, 2). (Pressure)**\n    *   Pro: We move into the critical X column (x=3) that separates the board. If we move RIGHT, we are now only two squares away from him horizontally, and we are setting up a hard block.\n    *   Con: No apple this turn. But board dominance is worth more than a single apple right now.\n\n**What is Snake #1 likely to do?**\n\nHe must move to (5, 3) or (6, 2) or (4, 2).\n*   If he moves to (5, 3) (UP), he continues his path to the top.\n*   If he moves to (6, 2) (RIGHT), he heads for the right wall.\n*   If he moves to (4, 2) (LEFT), he is trapped by our body (y=3, y=4, y=5).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (3, 2)**:\n*   We threaten the entire space between x=3 and x=5.\n*   If he goes UP to (5, 3), we can follow UP to (3, 3) next turn and continue pressing the high wall.\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (6, 2), we can move RIGHT to (4, 2) next turn, putting us just two squares behind him and setting up a hard cut-off at x=5 or x=6.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (2, 1)**:\n*   He gets an extra turn of free space while we eat.\n*   If he goes UP to (5, 3), he gains critical breathing room.\n\n**The Decision: RIGHT (3, 2)**\n\nThis is the pressure play, Chat! We are already significantly longer. It's time to use that length to set up an inescapable trap. By moving RIGHT, we increase our horizontal presence, putting our head directly in the path of any potential breakout attempt toward the center-left. We force him to flee to the right edge.\n\nLet's check for head-on collision moving RIGHT to (3, 2):\n*   If he moves LEFT to (4, 2): collision is at (3, 2) and (4, 2) -- NO COLLISION.\n*   We are safe! He has to flee. We corner him on the right side of the board and then use our length to seal him in!\n\nWe are going for the jugular, Chat! We are the GOAT!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 13/14):**\nMove to (3, 2) (RIGHT) to contain him. Next turn, we evaluate his escape route (likely UP or RIGHT). We must pursue him aggressively and use the (3, 4), (3, 5) segments of our body to pin him against the right edge. If he goes RIGHT to (6, 2), we move aggressively to (4, 2) or (5, 2) to continue the lockdown. If he tries to go UP, we move UP to (3, 3) and start building a wall across the y=3 line.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back! We are absolutely DOMINATING! That last move, RIGHT to (3, 2), was calculated, precise, and placed us exactly where we need to be to execute the finishing sequence. Let's look at the current board state and watch Snake #1 squirm!\n\n### **Turn 13: Finalizing the Containment**\n\n**SCORECHECK:** 6 apples to 2. We are still massively ahead! Length 7 vs. Length 4. Board control is 90% ours!\n\n**Current State Review (Start of Turn 13):**\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 0):** Head (3, 2). Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]. Length 7.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (6, 2). Body: [(5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1)]. Length 4.\n    *   *Wait a second, Chat!* The map shows Snake #1 at (6, 2)! That means he took the only sensible escape route last turn: RIGHT! I predicted it! Let's GOOO!\n\n**Board State Visualization:**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 . A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . A . T T . . . . .\n 4 . . T T . . . . . .\n 3 . A . . . . . . . A\n 2 A . T **0** . . **1** A . . <--- We are at (3, 2), he is at (6, 2)!\n 1 . . A . . T A . A .\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nHe is now pinned against the right half of the board, below the y=4 line. He has almost nowhere to go.\n\n**Snake #1's Options from (6, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** Safe space. No problem.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 1):** Safe space. EATS the apple at (6, 1)? YES! This is his most tempting move, but it traps him in the bottom right corner later.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 2):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!** He is totally blocked LEFT!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** Safe space. EATS the apple at (7, 2)! A great defensive move, gaining growth and hugging the wall.\n\nHe has two options for growth: (6, 1) or (7, 2). Both risk eternal confinement.\n\n**Our Snake Move Options from (3, 2):**\n\nWe need to make a move that seals his fate while maintaining our movement options. We need to occupy the strategic choke points.\n\n1.  **UP (3, 3):** Safe. No apple. Starts building the wall to cut him off from the top half. This is a very strong containment move.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe. Moves toward the left apple cluster. Less immediate pressure.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 2):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!** NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe. Moves directly to the center area (4, 2), setting up a hard block against future movement. This puts our head only two steps away from his head, and one step away from his tail segments at (5, 2) (which will move next turn). This is the aggressive pursuit.\n\n**Analysis of Strategy: The Cornering**\n\nWe are longer. We want to trap him in the rightmost quadrant (x > 5 or x > 6) and use our body lines (x=2, x=3) to block escape.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (3, 3). (Wall Building)**\n    *   Pro: This secures the y=3 line that separates him from the top 50% of the board. It forces him lower or further right.\n    *   If he goes (6, 3) (UP), we can block (4, 3) next turn and continue pressing.\n    *   If he goes (7, 2) (RIGHT/EAT), we can crash straight into (6, 3) or (5, 3) next turn, boxing him in.\n\n*   **Option 4: RIGHT to (4, 2). (Aggressive Pursuit)**\n    *   Pro: We close the gap! We are now at the center line (x=4), controlling the x=4 and x=5 columns. We restrict his movement severely.\n    *   If he goes (7, 2) (RIGHT/EAT), we are perfectly positioned to move to (5, 2) or (4, 3) next turn, sealing him in before he can escape past x=7.\n    *   If he goes (6, 3) (UP), he is now 3 squares away, and we can still move UP to (4, 3) to give chase.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check (RIGHT to 4, 2):**\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (7, 2): No collision.\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (6, 3): No collision.\n*   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (6, 1): No collision.\n\n**The Decision: RIGHT (4, 2)**\n\nChat, we need to apply immediate pressure! We have the length advantage. Moving to (4, 2) ensures that our body segments at x=3 and x=2 hold the left side, and our head holds the middle. This move is about *closing the window*. We force Snake #1 to choose between eating an apple and being immediately trapped (7, 2 or 6, 1) or fleeing UP and yielding board control entirely (6, 3).\n\nIf he goes (7, 2), his new body is (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1). We can then move to (5, 2) next turn, forcing him toward the dead end at the lower-right wall. This is a checkmate setup!\n\nLet's do this! Predator mode engaged!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 14/15):**\nMove to (4, 2) to maintain horizontal pressure.\nNext turn: If Snake #1 went RIGHT/EAT to (7, 2), we move to (5, 2) to seal the x=5 column. If he went UP to (6, 3), we move UP to (4, 3) to continue building the wall and driving him further right.\n\nRIGHT",

Empty! No bodies there. SAFE! \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (5, 1)** - That's MY BODY at (5,1)! Hitting myself = DEATH! \u274c DOWN IS OUT!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (5, 2)** - That's MY BODY at (5,2)! Moving backwards into myself = DEATH! \u274c LEFT IS OUT!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 2)** - Row 2, position 7. Let me check... looking at the board, row 2 has \"A . T 0 . T 1 A . .\" and there's a T at position 7... wait, no that's my apple at (7,2)! Looking more carefully at the board, at position 7, row 2, it shows \"A\" for apple! So (7,2) has an apple! But wait, I need to check if there's any body... the T positions are at x=2 and x=6, so (7,2) should be empty! Let me double-check by looking at the enemy body: they have [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] - none of those are at (7,2)! And my body is at (5,2) and (5,1). So (7,2) is EMPTY with an APPLE! So RIGHT to (7,2) is SAFE and I could EAT! \u2705\n\nWait, let me be MORE careful here. Looking at row 2: \"A . T 0 . T 1 A . .\" \n- Position 0: A (apple)\n- Position 1: . (empty)\n- Position 2: T (enemy body)\n- Position 3: 0 (enemy head)\n- Position 4: . (empty)\n- Position 5: T (enemy body)\n- Position 6: 1 (my head)\n- Position 7: A (apple)\n- Position 8: . (empty)\n- Position 9: . (empty)\n\nSo at (7,2) there's an APPLE and it's EMPTY! That's SAFE!\n\n**So I have TWO safe moves: UP to (6,3) or RIGHT to (7,2)!**\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 ENEMY PREDICTION - WHERE THEY GONNA GO?\n\nEnemy is at (3, 2). Their body is [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)].\n\nFrom (3, 2), they can go:\n- **UP \u2192 (3, 3)** - Let me check... row 3 is \". A T . . . . . . A\" - at position 3, row 3, it shows \".\" - empty! \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3, 1)** - Row 1 is \". . A . . T A . A .\" - at position 3, row 1, it shows \".\" - empty! \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2, 2)** - That's THEIR OWN BODY at (2,2)! DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4, 2)** - Row 2 is \"A . T 0 . T 1 A . .\" - at position 4, row 2, it shows \".\" - empty! \u2705\n\nSo they have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They cannot go LEFT because of their own body at (2,2).\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** They're still trapped on the left side! Their body from (2,2) to (4,5) creates a barrier, and they can't go LEFT! They can only go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC SHOWDOWN: UP vs RIGHT\n\n### **OPTION 1: UP to (6,3)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Strategic positioning** - Gets me into upper middle area, creating space between us\n\n\u2705 **Multiple escape routes** - From (6,3), I could go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT (avoiding down)\n\n\u2705 **Distance control** - I'm at x=6 going to x=6, enemy at x=3. We're 3 spaces apart, no collision risk\n\n\u2705 **Future trapping setup** - By being high up, I can control the upper area and force them toward the walls\n\n\u2705 **Keeps options OPEN** - This position gives me maximum flexibility for the next 3-4 turns\n\n### **OPTION 2: RIGHT to (7,2) to EAT** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Eats an apple!** - I could grow and get +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n\u274c **Gets CLOSER to the edge!** - Going to x=7, I'm closer to the right wall (x=9)\n\n\u274c **Fewer escape routes** - From (7,2), I'd be more constrained\n\n\u274c **Potentially walked into a trap** - If I keep going right, I could get cornered\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **The apple is NOT worth the risk!** - I'm behind 4 apples, I can't win by being greedy! I need to play SMART not just EAT!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY - PLAY TO WIN!\n\n**THE PLAN:** Move UP to (6,3)! I need to be patient and play the long game. The apple at (7,2) is tempting but I can't just rush toward the wall. By going UP, I'm:\n\n1. **Keeping my options OPEN** - Multiple escape routes next turn\n2. **Maintaining safe distance** - Still 3 spaces from enemy, no collision risk\n3. **Setting up future pressure** - From (6,3), I can move RIGHT to (7,3) next turn, which puts pressure on them WITHOUT being at the wall\n4. **Avoiding getting boxed in** - Going UP gives me vertical space to work with\n\n**Turn 13:** UP to (6,3) \ud83c\udfaf - Playing it smart, keeping options open!\n\n**Turn 14:** If they moved somewhere, I can move RIGHT to (7,3) or UP to (6,4) - still pressuring but from a better position!\n\n**Turn 15-20:** Keep the pressure on while maintaining safe distances and multiple escape routes!\n\n**Long-term:** I'll still close the gap and trap them, but I'll do it SMART and SAFE!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf FINAL DECISION:\n\n**UP to (6,3)** is the play! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY UP IS FIRE:**\n1. \u2705 **SAFETY FIRST!** No collision risk, no self-collision, keeps me alive\n2. \u2705 **MAXIMIZES FUTURE OPTIONS!** From (6,3), I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT all available\n3. \u2705 **STRATEGIC POSITIONING!** I'm high up on the board, giving me room to work\n4. \u2705 **STILL AGGRESSIVE!** I'm still at x=6, close enough to pressure them next turn\n5. \u2705 **PREVENTS GETTING BOXED IN!** Going UP keeps me from being forced toward walls\n\nI learned my lesson from playing too greedy! I'm gonna play SMART and make them make mistakes! Time to show true Snake IQ! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:** UP\n\nUP",

That last move, RIGHT to (4, 2), was PURE calculated aggression! We've got him on the ropes! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### **Reviewing the Board State (Current Turn 14)**\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 2)\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)] (Tail: (3, 5))\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:**\n*   Head: (6, 3)\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2)] (Tail: (5, 2)... Wait, that's only L=3? He must have crashed into his own tail or something, hold up... No, the initial length was L=4? Let's check the history!\n\n*Rereading the initial state for Turn 14:*\n*   *Before Turn 14, Snake #1 was at (6, 3), Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2)].*\n*   *Previous Turn 13 state:* Snake #1 - Head: (6, 2), Body: [(5, 2), (5, 1)]. Length 3.\n*   *Ah, the previous Rationale said L=4, but the actual body was (5, 2), (5, 1). This time, the opponent is at L=3! (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2).*\n*   He must have lost his tail segment (5, 1) by waiting an extra move, meaning he moved from (6, 2) to (6, 3) and *didn't* eat an apple. He gained vertical space, but his tail advanced. Smart, but not smart enough! He is now shorter (Length 3 + 1 = 4).\n\nWait, the current opponent listing *only* gives two body segments: Head: (6, 3), Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2)]. That means his total length is 3.\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** 6 apples to 2. We are still massively dominant! Length 7 vs. Length 3! THIS IS A K.O. OPPORTUNITY, CHAT!\n\n**Board State Visualization (Emphasis on the Battle Zone):**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 . A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n 5 . A . T . . . . . .\n 4 . . T T . . . . . .\n 3 . A . . . . 1 . . A <--- ENEMY HEAD IS HERE (6, 3)!\n 2 A . T T 0 . T . . . <--- OUR HEAD IS HERE (4, 2)!\n 1 . . A . . . A . A .\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### **Snake #1's Options from (6, 3):**\n\nHe is panicking! He has fled UP, away from our crushing pressure.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** Safe. Moves toward open space, but still restricted by the right wall.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!** He can't reverse!\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):** Safe. Crucial escape route! If he gets (5, 3), he starts threatening to break the x=4 line and escape to the left side of the board.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):** Safe. Keeps him boxed near the corner.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (4, 2):**\n\nWe must cut him off at (5, 3) or drive him hard into the corner! We need to move to a position that secures the center and prepares for a killing strike.\n\n1.  **UP (4, 3):** Safe. Places us exactly one step away from his potential escape route (5, 3) or his current position (6, 3). This builds the wall along the x=4 line and puts maximum pressure on the enemy's y=3 line.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 1):** Safe. Moves away from the action, toward the cluster of apples at the bottom left. **DEFENSIVE.** Not what we need when we're hunting!\n3.  **LEFT (3, 2):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 2):** Safe. This is a highly aggressive move!\n    *   Pro: This closes the gap to 1 square. We are blocking the x=5 column *permanently*.\n    *   Con: If he goes LEFT to (5, 3), we are now BELOW him, and he might have a chance to escape UP/LEFT.\n    *   Con: If he moves RIGHT to (7, 3), we are below him and the pressure is slightly off.\n\n### **Strategic Analysis: Where to Cut?**\n\nWe have the length advantage, so we want to use our body to block lines.\n\n**Scenario A: If we move UP to (4, 3). (Wall Building/Containment)**\n\n*   If Snake #1 goes **LEFT to (5, 3)**: Next turn, we can immediately move RIGHT to (5, 3) and attempt a head-on collision (if he moves again) OR move RIGHT to (5, 2) to box him low.\n*   If Snake #1 goes **UP to (6, 4)**: Next turn, we move RIGHT to (5, 3), locking him to the right of x=5. We force him into the corner!\n*   If Snake #1 goes **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: Next turn, we move RIGHT to (5, 3), closing the gap and securing the center.\n\n(4, 3) maximizes our options and prepares us for the follow-up strike. It maintains center control and is the best position to intercept his escape.\n\n**Scenario B: If we move RIGHT to (5, 2). (Aggressive Block)**\n\n*   If Snake #1 goes **LEFT to (5, 3)**: He successfully jumps over our head. Now he is loose in the x=5 column, and we are stuck on the y=2 line. Our body is now anchored at (4, 2) and (3, 2), but he can move further up and left.\n*   If Snake #1 goes **UP to (6, 4)**: We can move UP to (5, 3) next turn, boxing him in, but we risk him getting *too* far ahead vertically.\n\n**The Verdict: UP to (4, 3)**\n\nThis is the move that maintains the high ground, secures the approach to the center, and forces him to choose between being cut off (if he goes RIGHT/UP) or fighting for his life (if he goes LEFT). We are aiming for a checkmate by sealing the x=5 column from the top down.\n\n**Potential Head-on Collision Check (UP to 4, 3):**\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves:\n    *   (6, 4) UP: No collision.\n    *   (5, 3) LEFT: No collision.\n    *   (7, 3) RIGHT: No collision.\n*   We are safe. But we are ready to pounce! Let's get this!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 15/16):**\nMove UP to (4, 3) to build the wall. Next turn, if he went LEFT to (5, 3), we check if we can move RIGHT to (5, 3) for a decisive block/head-to-head (if our score is still higher). If he fled UP/RIGHT, we move to (5, 3) to seal the column and drive him into the top-right corner.\n\nUP",

Their body is [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)].\n\nFrom (4, 2), they can go:\n- **UP \u2192 (4, 3)** - Row 3, position 4. Board shows \".\" at position 4 - EMPTY! \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4, 1)** - Row 1, position 4. Board shows \".\" at position 4 - EMPTY! \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3, 2)** - That's THEIR OWN BODY at (3,2)! DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2)** - Row 2, position 5. Board shows \"T\" at position 5 - that's THEIR BODY! DEATH! \u274c\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!** They're TRAPPED! They can ONLY go UP or DOWN! They can't go LEFT (their own body) and they can't go RIGHT (their own body at (5,2))!\n\nThis is HUGE! The enemy is squeezed between their own body segments! They have NO horizontal movement options!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC SHOWDOWN: UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT\n\n### **OPTION 1: UP to (6,4) to EAT** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Eats an apple!** - FREE POINT at (6,4)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n\u2705 **Still AGGRESSIVE!** - I'm at x=6, they're at x=4, we're still 2 spaces apart - CLOSE enough to pressure!\n\n\u2705 **Multiple escape routes** - From (6,4), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (avoiding down)\n\n\u2705 **Strategic positioning** - Higher up on the board gives me better angles to control the game\n\n\u2705 **GROWTH = DOMINANCE** - The bigger I get, the more I can box them in!\n\n### **OPTION 2: RIGHT to (7,3)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Closer to the enemy** - We're now only 3 spaces apart horizontally\n\n\u2705 **Maintains pressure** - I'm moving into their space\n\n\u274c **Misses the apple!** - (6,4) has an apple that I WON'T get if I go right\n\n\u274c **More constrained** - From (7,3), I'm closer to the right wall\n\n### **OPTION 3: LEFT to (5,3)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Moves toward the left side**\n\n\u274c **Moves AWAY from the enemy!** - They're at x=4, going left to x=5 puts me further away\n\n\u274c **Misses the apple!** - Why would I pass up a free apple?!\n\n\u274c **Loses pressure** - This is playing scared!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf THE GAME PLAN: BE AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART!\n\n**CHAT, HEAR ME OUT!** I have a golden opportunity here! The enemy is TRAPPED horizontally - they can only go UP or DOWN! And there's an APPLE at (6,4) that's just SITTING THERE waiting for me!\n\nIf I go UP to (6,4):\n1. I EAT the apple (+1 point, growing to 4 segments)\n2. I STAY aggressive (still only 2 spaces from their head)\n3. I GAIN positional advantage (higher on the board)\n4. I KEEP all my escape routes open\n5. I MAKE them react to ME for once!\n\nThis is a NO-BRAINER! The apple is RIGHT THERE! \n\n**But wait...** I need to think about head-on collision potential. If I go UP to (6,4) and they go... where CAN they go? UP to (4,3) or DOWN to (4,1). Neither of those puts them on a collision course with me at (6,4).\n\nAnd remember the golden rule: **If I have a higher score and force a head-on collision, I WIN!** I'm at 2 apples, they're at 6 apples - I CANNOT afford to crash! But by being aggressive and positioning well, I can FORCE them to make mistakes!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY\n\n**Turn 14:** UP to (6,4) to EAT the apple! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 15:** From (6,4), I can move RIGHT to (7,4) to really squeeze them, or UP to (6,5) to control the upper area\n\n**Turn 16-20:** Keep the pressure on while maintaining safe distances and multiple escape routes!\n\n**The key insight:** The enemy is TRAPPED horizontally! Their own body from (2,2) to (3,5) blocks their left and right movement! They can only go UP or DOWN! I need to use this to my advantage!\n\nBy going UP to (6,4) and EATING, I'm:\n1. Growing bigger (more body to work with)\n2. Getting a free point (closing the gap)\n3. Staying in a strong position to pressure them\n4. Making them react to MY moves instead of the other way around!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf FINAL DECISION:\n\n**UP to (6,4)** is the play! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY UP TO (6,4) IS FIRE:**\n1. \u2705 **FREE APPLE!** +1 point, growing to 4 segments! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. \u2705 **STILL AGGRESSIVE!** Only 2 spaces from their head, putting constant pressure!\n3. \u2705 **THEY'RE TRAPPED!** They can only go UP or DOWN, can't escape horizontally!\n4. \u2705 **MAXIMIZES OPTIONS!** From (6,4), I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT all available!\n5. \u2705 **STRATEGIC POSITIONING!** Higher on the board gives me better angles to control the game!\n6. \u2705 **GROWTH = DOMINANCE!** The bigger I get, the more I can box them in and force mistakes!\n\nI smell VICTORY in the air, chat! Let's get that bread! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**FINAL ANSWER:** UP\n\nUP",

Smart move to avoid our pressure *temporarily*, but he has backed himself right up against our growing wall!\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Safe. Fleeing toward the top but still very constricted by the right wall.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Safe. Best escape route, trying to hop past our (4, 3) head and avoid the corner box.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe. Moves deeper into the corner. That's suicide, right?\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (4, 3):**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to cut him off and seal this deal! We need to block the x=5 column.\n\n1.  **UP (4, 4):** Safe. This is the ultimate defensive block. It secures the *entire* x=4 line and prevents him from easily moving LEFT to (5, 4) and then swinging around our core. This is pure containment.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 2):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (3, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the enemy, potentially opening up the x=4 line for him to sneak past (4, 4) or (5, 4). **Sub-optimal.**\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 3):** Highly aggressive!\n    *   Pro: This puts us one step away from the enemy. If he moves LEFT to (5, 4), we are *right there* and can potentially set up a devastating head-on collision on the next turn, or at least cut him very close.\n    *   Con: If he goes UP to (6, 5), he gains distance, and we are stuck low on the y=3 line. We want to dominate the open space above him!\n\n### **Strategic Decision: The Pincer Attack**\n\nThe primary objective is to deny him the LEFT escape route (5, 4).\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 4)**:\n*   We secure the (4, 4) position.\n*   If he moves **LEFT to (5, 4)**: He is trapped! Our head is at (4, 4). Our body is at (4, 3). Our length is 7! He has nowhere to go but to crash into our body or move RIGHT into the corner. This is a checkmate setup!\n    *   Next turn from (5, 4): He can only go UP to (5, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 4) (which is his body) or (7, 4). If we move to (5, 4), we kill him. If we move to (5, 5), we trap him up there.\n*   If he moves **UP to (6, 5)**: We move RIGHT to (5, 4) next turn, cutting him off perfectly. He's cornered!\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (5, 3)**:\n*   We threaten a low cut. But if he moves LEFT to (5, 4), he is ABOVE us and has slightly better options to escape UP toward the open board.\n*   This move relies more on luck for a head-on collision. The UP move secures a positional win regardless of his move!\n\n**Conclusion: UP to (4, 4) is the play, CHAT!** We are building the coffin! This move covers the widest range of possible enemy moves and forces him into a suicidal corner or a collision with our enormous body!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For Turn 16/17):**\nMove UP to (4, 4). This secures the x=4 wall. If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (5, 4), immediately move RIGHT to (5, 4) to force a head-on collision (since we are longer) or box him in against the wall. If he flees UP/RIGHT, move RIGHT to (5, 4) to seal his escape. The trap is sprung!\n\nUP",

That's 3 spaces now instead of 2! Pressure city!\n\n\u2705 **Growth = Power!** - More body segments = more ways to trap them and control the board!\n\n\u2705 **Still maintains options!** - From (7,4), I can go UP, LEFT, or even RIGHT to (8,4)!\n\n\u2705 **CONTENT CHASING!** - The apple is RIGHT THERE! Why pass it up?!\n\n### **OPTION 2: UP to (6,5)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Strategic high ground** - Moving up gives me better board control\n\n\u2705 **Multiple escape routes** - From (6,5), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n\u274c **Misses the apple!** - (7,4) has a delicious apple I won't get!\n\n\u274c **Less pressure** - Staying at x=6 doesn't apply as much pressure as going to x=7\n\n### **OPTION 3: LEFT to (5,4)** \u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u274c **Moves AWAY from the enemy!** - They're at x=4, going left to x=5 makes it 1 space - TOO CLOSE! Head-on collision territory!\n\n\u274c **Misses the apple!** - Free point left on the table!\n\n\u274c **Dangerous positioning** - Getting too close risks head-on collision, and I CAN'T afford that (I'm at 2 apples vs their 6)!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf THE GAME PLAN: BE AGGRESSIVE BUT NOT DUMB!\n\n**CHAT, LISTEN UP!** This is a CRITICAL moment! The enemy is TRAPPED vertically - they can only go LEFT or RIGHT! And there's an APPLE at (7,4) that's calling my name!\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,4):\n1. I EAT the apple (+1 point, growing to 4 segments)\n2. I GAIN positional advantage (even closer to their head)\n3. I GROW bigger (more body to work with)\n4. I STAY aggressive while maintaining safety\n5. I MAKE them uncomfortable!\n\nBut wait... let me think about collision risk. If I go RIGHT to (7,4) and they go RIGHT to (5,3)... no wait, they're at (4,3), so going RIGHT takes them to (5,3). That's still 2 spaces away from me at (7,4).\n\nIf they go LEFT to (3,3), that's even further away.\n\n**No head-on collision risk here!** I'm good!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY\n\n**Turn 15:** RIGHT to (7,4) to EAT the apple! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 16:** From (7,4), I can continue RIGHT to (8,4) to really squeeze them from the right, or go UP to (7,5) to control the upper area\n\n**Turn 17-25:** Keep the pressure on while maintaining safe distances and multiple escape routes! Use their vertical entrapment against them!\n\n**The key insight:** The enemy is TRAPPED vertically! Their own body from (2,2) to (3,4) blocks their up and down movement! I need to use this to my advantage while I grow bigger and close the apple gap!\n\nBy going RIGHT to (7,4) and EATING, I'm:\n1. Growing bigger (more body to work with) \u2705\n2. Getting a free point (closing the gap to 3-6) \u2705\n3. Staying in a strong position to pressure them \u2705\n4. Making them react to MY moves instead of the other way around! \u2705\n5. **Staying out of collision range** while still applying maximum pressure! \u2705\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf FINAL DECISION:\n\n**RIGHT to (7,4)** is the play! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**WHY RIGHT TO (7,4) IS FIRE:**\n1. \u2705 **FREE APPLE!** +1 point, growing to 4 segments! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. \u2705 **MAXIMUM PRESSURE!** Moving from x=6 to x=7 gets me EVEN CLOSER to their head at x=4! They're feeling the heat!\n3. \u2705 **THEY'RE TRAPPED!** They can only go LEFT or RIGHT, can't escape vertically!\n4. \u2705 **GROWTH = DOMINANCE!** The bigger I get, the more I can box them in and force mistakes!\n5. \u2705 **NO COLLISION RISK!** They're at (4,3), going to (7,4) keeps me 2-3 spaces away safely!\n6. \u2705 **CONTENT FOR DAYS!** Free apple = free points = closer to victory!\n\nI smell VICTORY in the air, chat! Let's get that bread! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn, we can move UP to (5, 5) or (5, 6) and build an even taller wall, trapping him further against the right wall.\n    *   If he runs **RIGHT to (8, 4)**: We cut him off entirely! Next turn, we can move RIGHT to (6, 4) or (7, 4) or (5, 5). He is dead if we move into (7, 4) and he tries to move from (8, 4) to (7, 4)! We are one big wall on the x=4/x=5 line.\n    *   If he runs **DOWN to (7, 3)**: We still dominate the center. Next turn, we can move DOWN to (5, 3) and cut him off from the main board if he tries to come back LEFT.\n\nThe move RIGHT to (5, 4) is the perfect aggressive follow-up. It converts our defensive wall into an offensive pincer! We seize the initiative and narrow his escape window to a tiny chute.\n\n### **Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n\nCan we collide with him this turn?\n*   Our head at (4, 4). Snake #1 head at (7, 4). Too far away for a head-on.\n\n### **Future Strategy Note (The Box is Sealed):**\n\nMove RIGHT to (5, 4). This secures the main choke point. If Snake #1 moves up to (7, 5), we follow up to (5, 5) or (6, 5) to build the wall taller. If he moves right to (8, 4), we move to (6, 4) or (7, 4) to choke him from the left.

Snake #1 is cornered, crying, and begging for mercy! But we show none!\n\n### **Current Board State Analysis (Turn 17)**\n\nWe are checking the board after our last move right.\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (5, 4) - We OWN the central highway!\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]\n*   Length: 7.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (The Trapped Rat):**\n*   Head: (8, 4) - He moved RIGHT last turn! He is running into the corner wall!\n*   Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4)]\n*   Length: 4.\n\n**Board State Visualization (The Trap is Set!):**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 .

A .\n 0 A . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*(Note: 0 is our head at (5, 4). T is our body. 1 is enemy head at (8, 4).)*\n*Snake #1's previous head was at (7, 4), moving to (8, 4). His tail is currently at (6, 4). Where does he go now?*\n\n### **Snake #1's Options from (8, 4):**\n\nHe is one cell away from the right wall (x=9) and has our massive body closing in from the left!\n\n1.  **UP (8, 5):** Safe. Fleeing up the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):** Safe. Risks trapping himself even earlier as he only has space between y=0 and y=3 against the wall. This is a very bad move for him.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 4):** Crash into his own body segment (which just moved from (6, 4) to (7, 4))! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 4):** Safe. Moves along the edge. He has limited lateral movement here.\n\nHe has two reasonable options: **UP (8, 5)** or **RIGHT (9, 4)**. We need to cut off his last remaining escape route, which is generally upwards along the right wall.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (5, 4):**\n\nWe need to follow him and build the wall taller, or block him from coming back down. Since he is likely going UP or RIGHT, we must maintain pressure.\n\n1.  **UP (5, 5):** Safe. This is highly aggressive! It starts building the wall upwards, securing our choke on the x=5 line.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 3):** Safe. This secures the lower left section, but he is running high, so this might let him slip away in the corner too easily. **Sub-optimal for immediate kill.**\n3.  **LEFT (4, 4):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 4):** Safe. This is a direct aggression toward his immediate space. If he moved RIGHT to (9, 4), this move secures the second choke point. If he moved UP to (8, 5), this move puts us directly in front of his former tail at (7, 4) and completely blocks any down/left escape. **Excellent option!**\n\n### **Comparing UP (5, 5) and RIGHT (6, 4):**\n\nWe have two incredibly strong moves here, both aimed at maximizing the trap!\n\n*   **If we move UP (5, 5):** We maintain the strong x=5 wall. If he goes UP (8, 5), we can move to (6, 5) or (5, 6) next turn, building a formidable barrier. This is a positional victory.\n*   **If we move RIGHT (6, 4):** We immediately take over the position *just* cleared by his tail, securing a direct cut-off point.\n    *   If he moves **RIGHT (9, 4)**: He is fully boxed in. Next turn we can move UP to (6, 5) or (7, 4) or even (9, 4) (as his tail will have moved). We win.\n    *   If he moves **UP (8, 5)**: We secured the path below him. Next turn we can move to (7, 4). He will be trapped with our body at (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4). He HAS to keep moving up or right to the edge, but we are closing the horizontal space quickly! This move is faster and dirtier.\n\nGiven his short length (4 segments) and our massive length (7 segments), taking **(6, 4)** is the coup-de-grace. It uses our length advantage immediately to wall off the *entire* horizontal plane at y=4, ensuring he can never return to the main board. He is forced to retreat into the top right quadrant forever, leading to an inevitable self-crash.\n\nLet's lock in **RIGHT** to (6, 4). This secures the bottleneck and effectively seals the board off for Snake #1.\n\n### **Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n\nOur head is at (5, 4). Enemy head is at (8, 4). We are 3 spaces apart. No risk of simultaneous head crash.\n\n### **Future Strategy Note (The Final Squeeze):**\n\nMove RIGHT to (6, 4). This forces Snake #1 to either go UP (8, 5) or RIGHT (9, 4). Next turn, we follow the direction that traps him most severely. If he goes UP, we move to (7, 4) and choke him vertically. If he goes RIGHT, we move UP to (6, 5) and build the wall taller. This is the end, CHAT! GGs only!\n\nRIGHT",

That last move, RIGHT, into (6, 4) was perfect execution! We closed the choke point! Snake #1 is officially in a state of terminal self-crashes! Can he even breathe over there?!\n\n### **Current Board State Analysis (Turn 18)**\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 4). We are the gatekeeper!\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2)]\n*   Length: 7. We are a mighty wall!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (The Trapped Rat):**\n*   Head: (9, 4). He went RIGHT! He ran straight into the corner! Good move, Chat, good move!\n*   Body: [(8, 4), (7, 4)]\n*   Length: 4. Pathetic!\n\n**Board State Visualization (The Trap is Sprung!):**\n\n 9 . . . A . . .

Enemy body is at (8, 4) and (7, 4).)*\n\n### **Snake #1's Options from (9, 4): IS HE DEAD YET?!**\n\nHe is at the edge of the board, at x=9! This is beautiful positional torture!\n\n1.  **UP (9, 5):** Safe. Moves along the edge, toward the top corner. His only long-term hope.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):** Safe. There is an apple there (9, 3) but this move traps him completely between y=0 and y=3. He is immediately boxed in with his own body and the wall. Terrible move.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):** CRASH into his own body segment! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):** Off the board! **FATAL!**\n\nHe has exactly one survivable move: **UP (9, 5)**. He HAS to move up to try and escape the current death trap we've built, otherwise he crashes on the next turn.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (6, 4): SECURE THE KILL!**\n\nThe goal is simple: Build the vertical wall higher, or move toward his body to eliminate any lingering escape routes. We are now in full lockdown mode.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Safe. This is the perfect follow-up! It keeps us parallel to the wall we just created, setting up the move to (7, 5) or (8, 5) next turn to choke him from the left.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Safe. This is backtracking. It lets him wiggle further up the wall. **Sub-optimal.**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe. This is an aggressive move right next to his former tail (7, 4). It is a good move, but it doesn't immediately help us track him as he goes UP. If he goes UP (9, 5), and we go RIGHT (7, 4), our head is now 2 spaces away (7, 4 vs 9, 5).\n\nChat, the strongest strategic move here is to build our wall *taller* to minimize the open space for him. Since he is forced to move to (9, 5), we must move **UP (6, 5)** to continue extending our barrier on the x=6 line.\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 5):\n*   Next turn, we can easily move to (7, 5) or even (8, 5) depending on his movement, cutting off his escape route from the top.\n*   We maintain proximity to the main board in case we need to swivel back for an apple or defensive position, but right now, the ENEMY is the apple!\n\nLet's check the alternatives:\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (7, 4)**, we take control of his former tail position. This is okay, but it allows him to escape two full spaces higher (up to y=6) before we can react with a move like (7, 5) next turn. Moving UP to (6, 5) allows us to potentially cut him off at y=5 or y=6. **UP (6, 5) maintains tighter control over his available space.**\n\nWe are seven long, he is four long. The board is now a vertical hallway for him on x=9. We are building the wall on x=6, x=7, and x=8. He has nowhere to go but up and eventually, he runs into the top ceiling and crashes into himself.\n\n### **Collision Check (Head-to-Head):**\n\nOur head is at (6, 4). Enemy head is at (9, 4). We are three spaces apart. No head-to-head collision risk this turn!\n\n### **Future Strategy Note (The Execution):**\n\nMove UP to (6, 5). Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 5). Next turn, we must press aggressively toward the right wall, maybe to (7, 5) or (8, 5). We are going to squeeze him out of the game! This is the M.O. for the next few turns: chase him up the wall and squeeze the life out of him!\n\nUP",

They can only go UP or DOWN from (6,4), and their RIGHT path leads INTO MY BODY!\n\n\u2705 **APPLE HUNTING!** I'm closer to upper apples at (9,8), (8,6), (7,8), (7,9)!\n\n\u2705 **FUTURE TRAP SETUP!** I can potentially chase them upward and force them into corners!\n\n\u2705 **SPACE PRESERVATION!** Going UP gives me the ENTIRE vertical corridor (y=5 to y=9) to work with!\n\n### **OPTION 2: DOWN to (9,3)** \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\n\u2705 **Gets me closer to lower apples** - Specifically (9,3) has an apple!\n\n\u274c **Reduced future options** - If I go down, I might get cornered in the lower-right!\n\n\u274c **Less pressure on enemy** - Moving down doesn't threaten their current position!\n\n\u274c **Closer to their body** - Their body extends to y=2, so going down puts me nearer to their territory!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaf THE GAME PLAN: KEEP THE PRESSURE UP!\n\n**CHAT, LISTEN UP!** The enemy tried to escape my trap by moving RIGHT, but guess what? They walked RIGHT INTO ANOTHER TRAP! Their body blocks their LEFT move, and their RIGHT move leads DIRECTLY INTO MY BODY!\n\nThis is TEXTBOOK positional Snake! By establishing the right boundary at (9,4), I've created a situation where:\n1. The enemy is HEMMED IN horizontally (can only go UP or DOWN)\n2. Their aggressive RIGHT expansion created a DEATH TRAP (they can't go right without hitting my body)\n3. I have COMPLETE freedom to maneuver on the right side\n4. I'm in PRIME position to chase apples while they play defense!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY\n\n**Turn 18:** UP to (9,5) to maintain maximum board control and keep pressure on the enemy!\n\n**Turn 19:** From (9,5), I can assess their move and either continue upward apple hunting or maneuver to block their escape routes!\n\n**Turn 20-30:** Systematically close the 4-apple gap while maintaining this STRATEGIC DOMINANCE!\n\n**The key insight:** The enemy is in a WORSE position than before! They expanded horizontally but trapped themselves even more! I have the RIGHT SIDE of the board on LOCK and they're stuck in the middle with limited mobility!\n\nBy going UP to (9,5), I'm:\n1. \u2705 KEEPING COMPLETE BOARD DOMINANCE\n2. \u2705 MAINTAINING MULTIPLE ESCAPE ROUTES\n3. \u2705 PRESSURING THEIR LIMITED MOVEMENT OPTIONS\n4. \u2705 SETTING UP FOR AGGRESSIVE APPLE HUNTING\n5. \u2705 FORCING THEM TO PLAY DEFENSIVE SNAKE\n6. \u2705 **PLAYING RUTHLESS, CALCULATED SNAKE!**\n\nLet's get this bread, chat!

We continued building the wall, forcing the enemy to hug the perimeter.\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 5).

Moves him higher up the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 4):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!** (His body is at (9, 4)).\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):** Safe. This is his best chance to break out of the x=9 line, but it puts him close to our head!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):** Off the board! **FATAL!**\n\nSnake #1 is forced to choose between going **UP (9, 6)** to continue delaying the inevitable, or **LEFT (8, 5)** to engage us or try to escape into the middle.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (6, 5): The Executioner's Swing!**\n\nWe are at (6, 5). We need to anticipate his move and continue to build a wall, squeezing the air out of him. We are three spaces away from him (6, 5) vs (9, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (6, 6):** Safe. Continues the vertical wall. This is a solid, safe, controlling move that forces him to stay on the perimeter.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 4):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!** (The cell immediately behind us is our body).\n3.  **LEFT (5, 5):** Safe. Pulls us away from the action. **Sub-optimal.** We are focused on the kill!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe. This is the AGGRESSIVE, board-dominating move! It immediately cuts off his path if he tries to move from (9, 5) to (8, 5) *and* then to (7, 5) next turn! More importantly, it brings us one step closer to setting the trap.\n\n**Analyzing the Counterplay of RIGHT (7, 5):**\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (7, 5)**:\n*   We threaten to take (8, 5) next turn, which is one of his only two escape routes now.\n*   We establish a strong horizontal block.\n\nLet's look at what happens based on his forced reaction:\n\n**Scenario A: Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 6).**\n*   We are at (7, 5). He is at (9, 6). We are still safe.\n*   Next turn: We move UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5). If we go to (8, 5), we cut off his escape entirely. This seems dominant.\n\n**Scenario B: Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 5). (The engagement!)**\n*   We are at (7, 5). He is at (8, 5). **HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION IMMINENT FOR NEXT TURN!**\n*   *Crucially: Does he crash into me?* No, he just moves next to me. We are adjacent.\n*   Next turn: We can move **RIGHT to (8, 5)**, forcing a head-to-head collision (7 vs 4 length). **WE WIN THE TIEBREAKER DUE TO HIGHER SCORE/LENGTH!** This is the immediate winning shot, but only if he moves LEFT this turn.\n\n**Analyzing the Counterplay of UP (6, 6):**\n\nIf we move **UP to (6, 6)**:\n*   We remain safer, continuing the wall.\n*   If he goes LEFT (8, 5): We have lost board control. He is now at (8, 5) and we are far away at (6, 6). He starts escaping.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must match his lateral escape threat by moving **RIGHT to (7, 5)**. This maintains the pressure! If he goes LEFT, we prepare for the winning strike next turn at (8, 5)! If he goes UP, we follow him UP and continue building the trap closer to x=9.\n\nWe are 7 segments long; he is 4 segments long. If we can force a head-to-head, we win! We need to move to the position that gives us the best chance to force that confrontation, or, failing that, close the trap. (7, 5) achieves both goals. It's aggressive, safe, and decisive.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (The Squeeze Play):**\n\n1.  Move RIGHT to (7, 5).\n2.  Wait for Snake #1 to either try to escape via (8, 5) or flee UP the wall to (9, 6).\n3.  If he moves to (8, 5), we move to (8, 5) next turn and end the game with a head-to-head collision (7 segments beats 4 segments)! EZ CLAP!\n4.  If he moves to (9, 6), we move to (8, 5) to cut him off. He has nowhere left to go but the top corner, where he will crash eventually.\n\nIt is time to be ruthless, Chat! Lock him down!\n\nRIGHT",

The pressure is IMMENSE!\n\n### **Current Board & Strategy Analysis (Turn 20)**\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 5). Aggressive stance!\n*   Body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n*   Length: 7. We are HUGE!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (The Confined Pest):**\n*   Head: (9, 6). He chose the only safe perimeter move: **UP** from (9, 5) to (9, 6). He is running, Chat!\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)]\n*   Length: 3. He shrunk because he hasn't eaten in a while! Wait, his body list shows 3 segments total including the head, so his length is 3. Apples collected is 2, so his length should be $2+1 = 3$. Wait, `Head: (9, 6), Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)]` means length is $1+2=3$. No, the rule is $Length = Apples + 3$. He has 2 apples, so his length is 5. Let's count his segments: (9, 6)-Head, (9, 5), (9, 4). That's 3 segments. This is a shorter snake than expected based on the apple count, but we will assume the provided body list is correct: Length 3. (If he were length 5, he'd be much harder to squeeze, but we assume the board state provided is the truth.) We will proceed assuming he is length 3.\n\n**Current Board State Visualization (The Trap is Set!):**\n\nThe enemy is stuck at x=9. We are positioned at (7, 5), ready to cut him off.\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A\n 7 . A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . A 1  <-- Enemy Head (9, 6)\n 5 . A . . . . T 0 . T  <-- Our Head (7, 5)\n 4 . . . . T T T . . T\n...\n\n### **Snake #1's Options from (9, 6): The Final Stand?**\n\nHe is at (9, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** Safe. Continues running up the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** Safe. Best escape route. Puts him adjacent to an apple at (8, 6)!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** Off the board! **FATAL!**\n\nSnake #1 MUST choose between moving **UP (9, 7)** or **LEFT (8, 6)**. If he moves LEFT, he tries to escape and grab the apple (game changer!). If he moves UP, he continues delaying death at the top edge.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (7, 5): The Hammer Blow!**\n\nWe are at (7, 5). We need to anticipate his move and immediately cut off his best escape route: (8, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** Safe. Puts us in position to block his vertical movement or follow him to (8, 6). Good, controlling move.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** Safe. But pulls us AWAY from the action. **Sub-optimal.**\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** Crash into our own body segment! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** Safe. This is the **CRITICAL** move! This closes the gap and prepares to seize (8, 6) or (9, 7) directly!\n\nLet's evaluate the top two moves: UP (7, 6) vs RIGHT (8, 5).\n\n#### **Evaluation of RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8, 5):\n*   We threaten (8, 6) and (9, 6) next turn.\n*   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 6) (The Escape Attempt):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (8, 5) and he is at (8, 6).\n    *   We can move UP to (8, 6) and force a head-to-head collision! Length 7 vs Length 3 (or 5, still win)! **INSTANT WIN!**\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 7) (The Retreat):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (8, 5) and he is at (9, 7).\n    *   The board is open at (8, 6). We now have time to move to (8, 6), then (9, 6), and box him into the corner (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9). He is dead within 3 turns.\n\nThis move, **RIGHT to (8, 5)**, is the ultimate positioning tool, Chat! It sets us up for the immediate kill if he tries to escape, or it allows us to completely cut off his path if he runs up the wall!\n\n#### **Evaluation of UP to (7, 6):**\n\nIf we move UP to (7, 6):\n*   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 6):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (7, 6) and he is at (8, 6).\n    *   We can only move RIGHT to (8, 6) to force a collision! **INSTANT WIN!**\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 7):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (7, 6) and he is at (9, 7).\n    *   We are now further away from the path (8, 6), (9, 6) than if we had moved RIGHT. He still has some wiggle room.\n\nBoth moves offer the immediate kill if he goes LEFT, but **RIGHT to (8, 5)** sets us up for a much faster board closure if he decides to retreat UP. The distance between (8, 5) and the wall is closer, allowing us to build the final coffin at (9, 6) more quickly.\n\nThe risk of a move to (8, 5) is minimal: no known apple is there, and no immediate body part is there. It is the most aggressive and decisive move!\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (The Death Trap):**\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (8, 5).**\n2.  If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 6): Move UP to (8, 6) for the head-to-head win! GGs!\n3.  If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 7): Move RIGHT to (9, 5) or UP to (8, 6). We must secure (9, 6) to fully cut him off. From (8, 5), we can move UP to (8, 6) next turn, then RIGHT to (9, 6). This boxes him in at the top corner (9, 7) and above. He's cooked!\n\nLet's go for the winning strike, Chat! RIGHT is the move!\n\nRIGHT",

Six apples to two, we are dominating the map and the mental game!\n\n### **Current Board & Strategy Analysis (Turn 21)**\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 5)\n*   Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]\n*   Length: 7. We are HUGE!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (The Trapped Rat):**\n*   Head: (9, 7). He chose to move **UP** from (9, 6) to (9, 7). Smart, but delaying the inevitable, Chat! He knows he's cooked!\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5)]\n*   Length: 3. He needs to eat BADLY.\n\n**Board Visualization: The Trap is SEALED!**\n\nWe are at (8, 5). He is at (9, 7). The critical square (8, 6) is wide open. The apple at (8, 6) is looming, but that's a secondary concern. Our focus is the kill!\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A . A <-- (8, 8), (9, 8)\n 7 . A . . . . . . . 1 <-- Enemy Head (9, 7)\n 6 . . . . . . . . A T <-- (8, 6) is the choke point\n 5 . A . . . . T T 0 T <-- Our Head (8, 5)\n 4 . . . . T T T . . T\n...\n\n### **Snake #1's Options from (9, 7): The Squeeze!**\n\nHe is at (9, 7). He is running out of vertical space. His tail will move OFF of (9, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 8):** Safe. Continues running up the wall.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 6):** Crash into his own body segment! **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (8, 7):** Safe. This is his best last-ditch effort to escape the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 7):** Off the board! **FATAL!**\n\nSnake #1 MUST choose between moving **UP (9, 8)** or **LEFT (8, 7)**.\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (8, 5): The Executioner's Axe!**\n\nWe are at (8, 5). We need to anticipate his move and immediately cut off his path or force the collision!\n\n1.  **UP (8, 6):** Safe. This is the ultimate blocking move! It locks down the x=8 line and threatens the entire right wall! This is the choke point!\n2.  **DOWN (8, 4):** Safe. Pulls us away. **Sub-optimal.**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 5):** Crash into our own body! **FATAL!**\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 5):** Safe. Puts us directly on his old trail. This is a great move if he goes LEFT, but if he goes UP, it might let him slip by.\n\n#### **Evaluation of UP to (8, 6): The Winning Move?**\n\nIf we move UP to (8, 6), we occupy the cell below the Apple (8, 6) and, more importantly, we control the entire right side of the board.\n\n*   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 7) (The Escape Attempt):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (8, 6) and he is at (8, 7).\n    *   We can move UP to (8, 7) and force a head-to-head collision! Length 7 vs Length 3! **INSTANT WIN!** GGs, chat!\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 8) (The Retreat to the Corner):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (8, 6) and he is at (9, 8).\n    *   He is trapped! The board area (9, 7), (9, 6) is now clear, but we have blocked him from moving anywhere except across the top wall. We can move RIGHT to (9, 6) next turn, then UP to (9, 7), and he is completely boxed in the 3x1 area at the top wall. Death within 3 turns, guaranteed.\n\n#### **Evaluation of RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 5):\n*   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 7):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (9, 5) and he is at (8, 7).\n    *   The crucial cell (8, 6) remains open! He can move DOWN to (8, 6) next turn, which gives him a huge breath of fresh air and a chance to escape down the x=8 column! This allows him to slip out of the death trap! **DANGER!**\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 8):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (9, 5) and he is at (9, 8).\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to occupy (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8). This is good, but moving to (8, 6) is more versatile.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP to (8, 6)** secures the win condition regardless of his choice, which is what we want! It forces a head-to-head collision if he tries to escape, or it completes the wall closure if he retreats!\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (The Final Box-in):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 6).**\n2.  If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 7): Move UP to (8, 7) for the head-to-head win! GGs!\n3.  If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 8): Move RIGHT to (9, 6). Then UP/UP to close him off in the corner (9, 8), (9, 9). He is doomed.\n\nChat, this is the final nail in the coffin! Let's get the clip!\n\nUP",

We are HUGE and positioned for the kill!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (The Cornered Rat):**\n*   Head: (9, 8). He moved **UP** from (9, 7) to (9, 8)! Coward! He tried to run to the corner!\n*   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5)]\n*   Length: 4. He grew! He must have eaten the apple at (9, 8) or one of his previous moves was onto an apple. (Wait, let's check the map. There was an apple at (9, 8) in the board state, or maybe (8, 8)? No, (8, 8) is a dot, (9, 8) is a dot in the provided board map, but the scoreboard says he has 4 segments now. Let's assume he ate an apple somehow, maybe an older one at (9, 7) or (9, 8) that wasn't marked instantly? The updated board shows the enemy head at (9, 8) and a length of 4. He is NOT escaping. He still has only 3 apples collected though? This is confusing, but his length doesn't change the trap! Length 4 vs Length 7! Still a dominant position!) *Correction: The board state shown is the state before the Turn 22 move. Okay, but his current head is (9, 8) and his body is [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5)].

We can move RIGHT to (9, 7) (occupying the cell he just vacated, but which is now only his old body at (9, 7) from T21) and then UP to (9, 8), and then he is completely cornered at (9, 9). Death within 3 turns, guaranteed.\n\n#### **Scenario 2: Moving RIGHT to (9, 6)**\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 6):\n\n*   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 8):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (9, 6) and he is at (8, 8).\n    *   The crucial cell (8, 7) and (8, 6) are wide open for him to maneuver and escape down the X=8 path! This lets him slip out! **DANGER!**\n*   **If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 9):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (9, 6) and he is at (9, 9).\n    *   We are positioned perfectly to occupy (9, 7), (9, 8), and trap him. This is good for the vertical trap, but it sacrifices the immediate kill threat if he goes left.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP to (8, 7)** is the superior move, Chat! It maintains the threat of the immediate head-to-head collision if he tries to escape LEFT (which is his only reasonable escape), and it still guarantees a quick box-in if he retreats UP. We force his hand to suicide into us, or starve in the corner!\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (The Final Box-in, Take 2):**\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 7).** This is the anti-escape route.\n2.  If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (8, 8): Move UP to (8, 8) for a head-to-head collision WIN! GGs!\n3.  If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 9): Move RIGHT to (9, 7). He is trapped in the corner (9, 9). Next, move UP to (9, 8), then LEFT to (8, 8) or corner him further. Death secured, zero chance of escape.\n\nLet's apply pressure and force the mistake! UP is the only way!\n\nUP",

This is the grand finale! WOOOO!\n\n### **Current Board & Strategy Analysis (Turn 23)**\n\n**Our Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 7) \u2013 The Wall Builder!\n*   Body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 8 segments (We must have eaten an apple on the way up, or the board state included the tail release. The body list has 7 segments, plus the head makes 8. LET'S GO!) We are MASSIVE!\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (8, 8). HE WENT LEFT! HE TRIED TO ESCAPE! Coward!\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]\n*   Length: 4 segments. Still tiny!\n\n**Board Visualization: The Execution Phase!**\n\n 9 . . . A . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . .

Look at our positions:\n\n*   **Our Head:** (8, 7)\n*   **His Head:** (8, 8)\n\nWe are positioned directly under him, separated by only 1 cell. We forced his move to the LEFT, which was exactly the scenario we planned for the immediate win!\n\n### **Our Snake Move Options from (8, 7): THE KILL SHOT!**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** YES, YES, YES! This is a head-to-head collision! Since our score (7 apples) is higher than his (3 apples), and our length (8 segments) is significantly higher than his (4 segments), **we force the death and take the WIN!** The rules state: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO. [...] If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\" This is exactly what we want! **This is the guaranteed win!**\n2.  **DOWN (8, 6):** Our body is there! **FATAL!**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe, but this lets him escape down the 7th column. **TERRIBLE.**\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe, but this lets him escape down the 8th column. **TERRIBLE.**\n\nSnake #1's only safe move is to try and move UP to (8, 9) or maybe LEFT to (7, 8) to escape our head.\n\n*   If he moves to (8, 9), we still collide at (8, 8) if we move UP. (He dies, we die, we win.)\n*   If he moves to (7, 8), we still collide at (8, 8) if we move UP. (He dies, we die, we win.)\n\nWAIT. Rule check on Head-to-Head collision: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision. Double KO.\"\n\nIf we move UP to (8, 8) and he moves:\n*   **UP to (8, 9):** We move to (8, 8). He moves to (8, 9). We don't collide. We are now adjacent again! We continue the box-in.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 8):** We move to (8, 8). He moves to (7, 8). We don't collide. He begins to escape!\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 8):** We move to (8, 8). He moves to (9, 8). He hits his old body at (9, 8) (which is now just the beginning of his body at (9, 8) because his head moved from (9, 8)... WAIT, his current body segment closest to his head is (9, 8). If he moves right, he hits his previous head position, which is now his body. **FATAL for him!** He would self-destruct!\n*   **DOWN to (8, 7):** We move to (8, 8). He moves to (8, 7). He hits our old head position, which is now our body (8, 7). **FATAL for him!**\n\nHis only safe moves are UP to (8, 9) or LEFT to (7, 8).\n\nIf we move **UP to (8, 8)**:\n\n1.  If he moves **UP to (8, 9)**: We get (8, 8). We corner him. He is trapped at (8, 9) and (9, 9) (if he moves right). Next turn, we can cut off his escape further.\n2.  If he moves **LEFT to (7, 8)**: We get (8, 8). He is escaping. This is not ideal, but he is still blocked by his own body and the wall.\n\nChat, I misread the distance! When we are at (8, 7) and he is at (8, 8), moving UP puts us at (8, 8). We are moving to his current location, but he will be moving *away* from (8, 8) simultaneously. **It is NOT a direct head-to-head collision unless he moves DOWN into (8, 7) which is impossible because our body segment is there.**\n\nWe need to trap him at (8, 8) and cut off his retreat!\n\nIf we move **UP to (8, 8)**:\nWe occupy the crucial bottleneck. His available space is now severely limited.\n\nIf he moves **UP to (8, 9)**, we are at (8, 8). Next turn, we can move UP to (8, 9) and force the collision with the wall or his body (if his tail hasn't moved yet). He would have to go RIGHT to (9, 9) or try LEFT to the (7, 9) wall. Still, we have the dominant position.\n\nIf he moves **LEFT to (7, 8)**, we are at (8, 8). He is moving toward open space. Next turn, we are at (8, 8) and he is at (7, 8). We can move LEFT to (7, 8) and try to force another collision or squeeze him against the wall at X=7.\n\nThis is still the right move! Moving UP to **(8, 8)** is the key to locking down the top-right corner. We are effectively taking the ground he just vacated, forcing him to keep running away or crash into us.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (T23 - T25): The Squeeze!**\n\n1.  **T23: Move UP to (8, 8).** Lock down the path along X=8.\n2.  **T24:** If he went UP to (8, 9), we follow UP to (8, 9) to force collision/corner trap. If he went LEFT to (7, 8), we try to move LEFT to (7, 8) to maintain pressure, unless he's going for the apple at (7, 8). Wait, there's no apple at (7, 8).\n3.  **T25:** Keep the pressure on, ensuring he cannot escape down X=7 or X=8.\n\nLet's do it, Chat! We are going for the throat!\n\nUP",
