ELIMINATE.**\n\n2. **DOWN**: From (1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8) - There's an apple at (1, 8)! This is safe and gives me an immediate point. **GOOD OPTION.**\n\n3. **LEFT**: From (1, 9) \u2192 (0, 9) - This is safe (edge of board but valid). Moves me away from apples though. **SAFE but not optimal.**\n\n4. **RIGHT**: From (1, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) - This is safe. Moves me closer to center. **SAFE option.**\n\n**Evaluating the best safe moves:**\n\n- **DOWN to (1, 8)**: Captures an immediate apple! This grows my snake and is clearly the strongest move. After eating, I'll be at (1, 8) with body at (1, 9).\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 9)**: Safe but moves to a corner, potentially limiting future movement options.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2, 9)**: Safe and more central, but doesn't capture an apple this turn.\n\n**Strategy going forward:**\nWith an apple right next to me at (1, 8), I should absolutely take it. This gives me early momentum. After eating this apple, I'll have a body segment and be in a better position. The remaining apples are spread across the board - (5, 3), (9, 4), (7, 5), (6, 7) are reachable. I should continue moving toward the cluster of apples in the center-right area while monitoring the enemy snake's position.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",
