My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to increase my score, while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes, and my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (2, 8). To reach that apple, I should move UP.\n\nTherefore, my next move is: UP"

The closest apple is at (2, 8), and I can get there by going RIGHT then DOWN\n2. This also keeps me away from enemy snake #1 at (5, 9)\n3. This is a safe move as there's nothing in my immediate path\n\nFor next turn, I should remember to then go DOWN to get that apple at (2, 8).\n\nI'll move RIGHT to begin my approach to the nearest apple.\n\nRIGHT"
