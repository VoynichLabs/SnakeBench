We have two apples, and there's a clear path toward the next closest apple, strategically focusing on safe movement as well as possible future gains.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- **Our Snake (#1):** Head at (7, 3), trailing at (6, 3), (5, 3).\n- **Enemy Snake (#0):** Head at (4, 9), moving further away from our current area of interest in terms of apple collection.\n\n**Apple Assessment:**\n- The apple at (8, 4) is the closest. Pursuing this keeps us in a relatively open area, offering flexibility for subsequent moves.\n- The apples at (7, 7) and (8, 5) are nearby and may become future targets soon after capturing the apple at (8, 4).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP:** Moves to (7, 4). Keeps us in safe territory and heading toward the apple at (8, 4). This move is promising as it opens up future targeting options, without immediate threats.\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (7, 2). Safe but moves away from the apples of interest.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (6, 3), directly back into our body, which is deadly.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (8, 3). Safe and slightly closer to the apples at (8, 4) and (8, 5). However, moving up toward (7, 4) directly brings us closer to the apple target.\n\n**Strategic Plan Moving Forward:**\n- Prioritize going UP to position ourselves for the apple at (8, 4). It keeps us on a productive path while keeping avenues open.\n- Continuously evaluate Snake #0\u2019s movements; however, its current position holds no immediate threat.\n- Remain adaptive and prioritize capturing any non-threatening apples as they present themselves, ensuring our path is adaptable to keeping options open and risks minimized.\n\nUP",

This is moving directly backwards into my own body, which is not allowed.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves me to (3, 3), getting closer to the apple at (7, 3) and aligning me for direct pursuit in the next few turns.\n\n**Decision**: The RIGHT move keeps me on course to collect the apple at (7, 3), poses no immediate self-threat, and avoids collisions with the enemy snake.\n\n**Long-term Strategy**:\n- Pursue the apple at (7, 3) while maintaining a clear path. \n- Monitor Snake #0's movements to avoid potential collisions if it changes direction towards the same target.\n- Consider the apple at (8, 4) as a secondary target if the direct path to (7, 3) becomes unsafe due to the opponent's movement.\n\nRIGHT",

I have already collected the apple at (1, 3) last turn.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake**: Snake #0's head is at (1, 6) with no body yet, so no immediate threat from its body, but I need to be cautious of its moves as it approaches.\n\n4. **Safe Move Analysis**:\n   - **UP**: This move takes me to (1, 4). It's a potential path towards the apple at (8, 4) but moves closer to Snake #0's current vertical line, so slight risk of collision in subsequent turns.\n   - **DOWN**: This would move me back to (1, 2). While it keeps me in a safe area, it doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples and risks eventually restricting my movement.\n   - **LEFT**: This leads to (0, 3). No apples nearby and limits future movement options considerably.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves to (2, 3). This brings me closer to the apple at (7, 3) in the longer run and keeps my path open without immediately risking Snake #0's direction.\n\n**Best Move**: Moving RIGHT to (2, 3) is strategically beneficial as it directs me towards the apple at (7, 3) while avoiding any immediate threats from Snake #0's current path. It also maintains open movement paths for future turns.\n\n**Plan for Next Moves**:\n- Continue moving toward the apple at (7, 3), ensuring it's collected strategically while monitoring Snake #0's path to avoid collision.\n- Stay aware of alternative apples to adapt if Snake #0 poses a possible obstacle to my planned path.\n\nRIGHT",
