Move DOWN, which would move me towards the apple at (5, 1) but would put me in a more dangerous position near the enemy snake.\n4. Move RIGHT, which would be retracing my steps and is not advisable.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's new position, moving LEFT is still the best option. This will allow me to focus on collecting the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 3) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. Moving DOWN towards the apple at (5, 1) is now riskier due to the enemy snake's proximity, and moving UP towards the apple at (8, 8) would require a longer path and potentially put me at risk of colliding with my own body.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT, I should prioritize collecting the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 3). I need to closely monitor the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to adjust my strategy if it continues to move towards me or the apples I'm targeting. If the situation becomes too risky, I should consider the apple at (5, 1) as an alternative target, but only if I can safely navigate around the enemy snake. My main goal should be to collect the nearby apples efficiently while minimizing the risk of collisions with the enemy snake, the walls, and my own body. I should also keep an eye on any new apples that might appear and adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\nLEFT"

This apple is no longer a safe option for me to pursue.\n\nOptions:\n1. Move UP, which would take me towards the apple at (8, 8) but would require a longer path and potentially put me at risk of running into my own body.\n2. Move LEFT, which would bring me closer to the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 3) and maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n3. Move DOWN, which would move me towards the apple at (5, 1) but would put me in a more dangerous position near the enemy snake.\n4. Move RIGHT, which would be retracing my steps and is not advisable.\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's new position, moving LEFT is still the best option. This will allow me to focus on collecting the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 3) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake. Moving DOWN towards the apple at (5, 1) is now riskier due to the enemy snake's proximity, and moving UP towards the apple at (8, 8) would require a longer path and potentially put me at risk of colliding with my own body.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT, I should prioritize collecting the apples at (5, 3) and (6, 3). I need to closely monitor the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to adjust my strategy if it continues to move towards me or the apples I'm targeting. If the situation becomes too risky, I should consider the apple at (5, 1) as an alternative target, but only if I can safely navigate around the enemy snake. My main goal should be to collect the nearby apples efficiently while minimizing the risk of collisions with the enemy snake, the walls, and my own body. I should also keep an eye on any new apples that might appear and adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\nLEFT"
