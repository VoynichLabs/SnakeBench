This is the most direct path towards the apple at (1,7) and keeps me in control of the left side of the board. Moving LEFT to (0,2) would be more defensive but wouldn't advance my position towards any immediate objectives.

I need to position myself to reach this cluster before enemy #1.\n\n**My position**: I'm currently at (4,7) and moving toward the apple cluster. Enemy #1 is at (5,3) and could potentially move up to challenge me for these apples.\n\n**Movement priorities**:\n- **RIGHT (5,7)**: Continues toward the apple cluster and positions me to potentially reach (5,8) or (4,9) on the next turn\n- **UP (4,8)**: Safe but stays on the left side, doesn't progress toward the main apple cluster\n- **DOWN (4,6)**: Safe but moves away from the apple cluster\n\n## Move Comparison\n\n- **RIGHT (5,7)**: Best option - continues my path toward the apple cluster and maintains my lead over enemy #1\n- **UP (4,8)**: Safe but doesn't advance my position toward the apple cluster\n- **DOWN (4,6)**: Safe but moves away from the apple cluster\n\n## Long-term Plan (next 3-5 moves)\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,7), I should continue RIGHT toward (6,7) and then UP to (6,8) to eat the apple there. This puts me in the heart of the apple cluster. I need to watch enemy #1's movements - if it heads up the board, I may need to secure apples before it arrives. The key is to maintain my position advantage and continue toward the apple-rich area while keeping multiple escape routes open. I should also be aware of potential head-on collision scenarios if enemy #1 moves aggressively toward the same apple.\n\nRIGHT",

I need to carefully navigate around my own body which extends from (2,9) to (4,7). The key will be to move systematically right and down/up as needed to access these apples while maintaining escape routes and avoiding my own body.\n\nRIGHT",
