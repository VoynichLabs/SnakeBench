So that\u2019s out.\n\nChosen move: UP to (5,7)\nWhy UP?\n- It keeps multiple safe follow-ups (to (5,8), (5,9) for the big apple, or back to (6,7)/(5,6) if needed).\n- It presses the enemy\u2019s left-side posture, nudging toward a top-side box pattern without risking a head-on.\n- It maintains open space to pivot away if the enemy tries a chase or a cross-box attempt.\n\nShort-term plan (turns 9-12):\n- Head toward the apple at (5,9) by moving UP twice, then eat it if safe.\n- Watch for enemy\u2019s behavior: if they push rightward along row 7, avoid turning into a trap; stay one step ahead and keep a corridor to escape.\n- If the enemy starts retreating or circling, tighten the top corridor and keep them boxed in from the right side as you advance.\n\nSafety check:\n- You\u2019re not stepping into the enemy body now.
