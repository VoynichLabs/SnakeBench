Larger snakes win head\u2011on collisions, and the extra length blocks the opponent from slipping into our former head spot. After eating, we\u2019ll have head\u202f(7,\u202f1) and tail\u202f(6,\u202f1). That\u2019s still plenty of space to maneuver (we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT on the next turn).  \n\n**Long\u2011term thought:**  \nKeep the pressure on the opponent by staying on the right side of the board, harvest the cluster of apples near the 9\u2011column, and force the rival into tight corridors. Growing early is the key to dominating the arena.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Grab the apple, grow, and stay aggressive.  \n\n**Move:**  \n\nRIGHT",

The opponent remains a few cells away and cannot reach me in one turn.\n4. **No self\u2011collision** \u2013 RIGHT is not a backward move and does not hit any body segment.\n\nAll other safe moves (UP/DOWN) keep me in the open centre and give no immediate growth, which is sub\u2011optimal when both snakes are tied on apples.\n\n**Strategic note for the next turns**  \nAfter grabbing the apple at (9,\u202f1), aim for (9,\u202f0) or (9,\u202f2) to keep extending along the right edge. Meanwhile watch the opponent\u2019s rightward drift; when he\u2019s forced into the centre we can swing up or down to cut off his path and set up a potential head\u2011on when we have the higher apple count.\n\n**Decision:** take the aggressive, growth\u2011focused step.\n\nRIGHT",
