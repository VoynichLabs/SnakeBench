This keeps me off the bottom edge, preserves more movement options (can go up/down/left next turn except backwards), and secures a nearby apple before the enemy can realistically contest it.\n\nSafety check:\n- None of the legal moves step onto an occupied cell.\n- Enemy head at (8,0) can immediately take (7,0) if it wants, but it cannot contest (6,1) this turn.\n- Moving RIGHT avoids getting pinned on y=0 and maintains more escape options than moving DOWN.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Take the apple at (6,1) now.\n- After eating, reassess: prefer to stay toward open space (avoid getting trapped along the right wall).

(3,2) is much closer and uncontested this turn.\n- Moving RIGHT toward (7,4) risks getting funneled by my own body wall at y=5 (my body stretches across x=3..8 at y=5 and there are segments at (8,4),(9,4) etc), which could reduce escape options and lead to trapping on the right side.\n- LEFT keeps space but is slower to any nearby apples.\n- DOWN to (3,3) is safe now (no snake occupies that cell) and puts me one step from the apple at (3,2). Enemy head (#0 at (4,7)) is far and unlikely to contest (3,2) soon. DOWN preserves multiple follow-up options (continue down to (3,2) to eat, or veer left/right if the enemy approaches).\n\nShort plan:\n- Take the (3,2) apple over the next two turns (DOWN, DOWN).\n- After eating, reassess: prioritize (0,2) or (1,7) depending on enemy movement; avoid pushing into the narrow region to the right where my body already creates a wall.\n\nDecision:\nDOWN",
