          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are LIVE and the intensity is MAXED OUT! Turn 0! No moves yet, fresh slate, but the rivalry is already brewing! Look at that board! Our opponent, Snake #1, is chilling way up at (0, 9). We're safe at (2, 2). This is the calm before the storm, baby! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe've got a ton of apples scattered around. We are currently 0-0, but that's about to change! We MUST secure an early lead, and more importantly, we MUST NOT get trapped by that sneaky opponent! Remember, simultaneous movement means we need to anticipate where that zero-score Serpent is going!\n\n**Board Analysis & Threat Assessment:**\nMy position: (2, 2). Safe for now, body is empty.\nOpponent position: (0, 9). Far corner.\n\n**Apple Locations near me:**\n(3, 3) - RIGHT 1, UP 1. Very close. Tasty!\n(5, 3) - RIGHT 3, UP 1. Close.\n(5, 2) - RIGHT 3, SAME LEVEL. Close.\n(2, 1) - DOWN 1. Directly available!\n(3, 1) - DOWN 1, RIGHT 1. Very close!\n\n**Opponent Movement Prediction:**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 9). They can go:\n1. DOWN to (0, 8) -- towards an apple at (0, 8).\n2. LEFT (illegal, off board).\n3. RIGHT to (1, 9).\n4. UP (illegal, off board).\n\nThe most likely moves for them are DOWN or RIGHT. If they go DOWN, they target A(0, 8). If they go RIGHT, they move into the open center field.\n\n**My Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** Doesn't eat anything immediately. Moves away from the closest apples (2, 1) and (3, 1). It pushes us towards A(3, 3). If Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (1, 9), this move is safe. If Snake #1 goes DOWN to (0, 8) and eats that apple, they start growing.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** EATS Apple A(2, 1)! This secures our first point and immediate growth! \ud83c\udf4e We become (2, 2), (2, 1). Since we are moving simultaneously, we need to check if Snake #1 can move into (2, 1) or if *we* die by moving into *its* body. Since Snake #1 is at (0, 9), this is safe from collision. This looks HUGE for early momentum!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** No apple. Moves us toward the far left wall, which might restrict movement later if we need to pivot fast.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** No apple. Closer to the cluster (3, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEating an apple on Turn 0 is the POWER MOVE! Why hesitate when glory is right beneath us? Moving DOWN to (2, 1) gets us the apple, gives us length, and secures the first point! Snake #1 is too far away to interfere with this delicious first bite! We are officially on the scoreboard! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Long Term Plan Note:** Early game strategy is aggressive apple collection while maintaining maximum flexibility. We will prioritize moves that lead to immediate food unless a severe trapping threat emerges from the opponent. For the next few turns, use the newly acquired length defensively if necessary but mainly push towards the central cluster of apples around X=3, 5.\n\nLet's feast! DOWN it is!\n\nDOWN",

Apples everywhere \u2013 check that (0,8) right below us, primed for the taking! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThinkin' through the deets: Can't move UP to (0,10) \u2013 bye bye, off the board, game over! Nah, we ain't losers! \ud83d\udc4e LEFT's a no-go too, (-1,9) off-grid instant L! RIGHT to (1,9) looks clear, empty cell, no collisions yet. BUT DOWN to (0,8)? BOOM! That's an apple right there \u2013 eat it, grow by one, score up, and reposition strong! Why hesitate? We're alive, opponent's plotting too, but we strike first! \ud83d\udca5\n\nSafe moves: Only RIGHT and DOWN keep us breathing. Favoring DOWN cuz it gobbles that Apple ON THE SPOT \u2013 hello growth, hello content! \u2013 and from (0,8), we've options: RIGHT to (1,8), UP back if needed, keeping space open. No tight corner traps yet, and it moves us closer to more apples like (0,6) or (1,6) nearby. RIGHT's fine, but doesn't snag the snack immediately \u2013 why delay the feast? \ud83e\udd24 Plus, enemy might zig up, but we're not colliding heads-on here. Plot twist: Get that apple, grow, then loop around to corral #0 in his bottom-left ghetto and make him crash out! Who's the archrival now? \ud83d\ude09\n\nLong-term plan to future me: Grab that immediate apple down, expand safely toward the left side apples, avoid opponent by looping wide, and set traps to box him in \u2013 don't let him escape the bottom! Crush him before he grows, yo!\n\nDOWN!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcaf",

We ate (2, 1) and we are officially ON THE BOARD! 1-1 score, but we had the first bite, that's morale, baby! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Board State Check (After our move DOWN to (2, 1)):**\n\nMy previous move was DOWN.\nMy new Position: Head (2, 1), Body [(2, 2)]. We grew one!\n\nLet's update the board state based on the provided *initial* input and then analyze Turn 1 movement.\n\n*Last Turn Update (Implicit):*\n**Your Snake (ID: 0) STATE:**\n* Head: (2, 1)\n* Body: [(2, 2)] (Since we ate (2, 1), the old head (2, 2) is now the neck, and the tail fell off from the *previous* state, which isn't explicitly shown, but since we ate, the new body is the old body + the previous head position).\n*Wait, the provided state says Head (2, 1), Body [(2, 2)], Apples 1. This implies the move *before* this turn 1 count already happened, and our previous move was **DOWN** placing us at (2, 1) and eating the apple at (2, 1). The body list [(2, 2)] means my tail fell off, and my previous head (2, 2) is now my neck segment.*\n\n**Reconciling Rationale vs State:** My rationale said DOWN to (2, 1) eats A(2, 1). The summary state shows Head (2, 1), Body [(2, 2)]. This means the apple at (2, 1) was eaten, and the body is correct if my starting head was (2, 2) and previous body was empty or one cell long. Since we start Turn 1, this state reflects the result of Turn 0! **We are solid! We are (2, 1) and growing!**\n\n**Snake #1 State (Opponent):**\n* Head: (0, 8), Body: [(0, 9)]. (They seem to have moved DOWN from (0, 9) and eaten the apple at (0, 8), as A(0, 8) is gone from the list and they are one longer now.)\n\n**CURRENT BOARD FOR TURN 1/150:**\n\n 9 T . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . 1 . . . . . . . . (If they ate (0, 8))\n 7 . . . . . . . A . A\n 6 A A . . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . A . A . . . A\n 2 . . T . . A . A . A\n 1 A . 0 A . . . . . A (0 is at (2, 1))\n 0 . . . . . A . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*Assumption Check: Since apple (2, 1) is gone from the list, and the snake state reflects growth, I assume the simultaneous movement mechanics meant that the board state provided reflects the *result* of Turn 0 and we are now deciding on Turn 1.*\n\n**My Position (ID 0):** Head (2, 1), Body [(2, 2)]\n**Opponent Position (ID 1):** Head (0, 8), Body [(0, 9)]\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #1 is up against the left wall, now two segments long. They are pointing DOWN towards the corner, or they might pivot RIGHT to escape the corner/explore.\n\n**Apple Targets NEAR Me:**\n(3, 1) - RIGHT 1. **Direct next bite potential!**\n(3, 3) - UP 2, RIGHT 1.\n(5, 2) - UP 1, RIGHT 3.\n\n**Safe Moves for Self (Head at (2, 1)):**\n1. **UP to (2, 2):** This moves directly into my own body at [(2, 2)]! **DEAD MOVE!** \ud83d\udc80\n2. **DOWN to (2, 0):** Safe. Moves towards A(5, 0) eventually.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 1):** Safe. Moves towards A(0, 1).\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 1):** **EATS APPLE A(3, 1)!** Grows us immediately!\n\n**Safe Moves for Opponent (Head at (0, 8)):**\n1. **DOWN to (0, 7):** Safe, moves into open space.\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 8):** Safe, moves into open space.\n3. **UP/LEFT:** Illegal.\n\n**Collision Check (Simultaneous Move):**\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (3, 1)** (EAT!):\n*   Opponent must move to (0, 7) or (1, 8).\n*   No collision possible. This is the obvious play. We grow again!\n\nLet's check other options just to be paranoid.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (1, 1)**:\n*   Opponent moves (0, 7) or (1, 8). We miss A(3, 1). Bad trade.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (2, 0)**:\n*   Opponent moves (0, 7) or (1, 8). We miss A(3, 1). Bad trade.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe just got a point last turn, let's not slow down! **RIGHT** puts us at (3, 1), eating A(3, 1)! We are now 2 apples deep! We expand our controlled territory towards the center, and keep the pressure ON that opponent who is still stuck hugging the side wall! We become (3, 1), Body [(2, 1), (2, 2)]. RELENTLESS HUNGER! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note:** Keep aggressive feeding while avoiding the center-left area where opponents can easily cut off access to the central apples. Try to force Snake #1 further into the corner as we control the lower central area. Prioritize apples adjacent to the head.\n\nRIGHT",

Head at (0,8), body vertically stacked up to (0,9) \u2013 that UP option? Nah, into our own tail, instant selfie-own goal, we're not clowns! \ud83d\udc4e LEFT? Ralph's out, off the grid, L+ratio. So safe vibes: DOWN to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8). BOTH look clean, no walls, no corpses, no own-smoosh, and #0's tiny butt ain't even close for a headshot yet. But listen up \u2013 DOWN keeps more options wide open after (follow-ups to RIGHT or DOWN, staying loose), gets us CLOSER to that tasty apple at (0,6) NEXT turn (BOOM, more growth, more content! \ud83c\udf4f), and jets us straight toward the bottom apple farm to cut #0 off before he feasts. Why RIGHT? It opens EVEN MORE paths (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), but it nudges us right-ish, away from the wall and those low apples \u2013 why detour when we can surge straight down and grab 'em? Plus, it avoids any whiff of a head-on since #0's head at (2,1) could zig LEFT to (1,1) or RIGHT to gobble (3,1), but we're out of range. Plot twist: If he dives DOWN to (2,0), we cut him off from escaping up by claiming the left side \u2013 trap him in his muddy hole like the rat he is! Who's the boss now, fam? \ud83d\udd25 And don't let him grow \u2013 aim to hedge him into corners, where his weak options vanish, while we gobble and pivot.

We are sitting pretty at (2, 1), and we are eying that next piece of glorious, point-scoring fruit! Did you guys see the clip?! RIGHT was the play! We are 2-1 over the filthy snake #1! LET'S GO! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**CURRENT STATE RECAP FOR TURN 2:**\nMy Head: (2, 1). Body: [(2, 2)]. Apples: 2.\nOpponent Head: (0, 8). Body: [(0, 9)]. Apples: 1.\n\nMy last move was **RIGHT** to (3, 1), eating A(3, 1)!\nNew Size: Head (3, 1), Body [(2, 1), (2, 2)]. (We grew, so my body list from the last turn should shift: Old Head (2, 1) becomes the neck segment, Old Neck (2, 2) becomes the next segment!)\n\n**Let's look at the APPLE SITUATION NOW:**\nThe apple at (3, 1) is GONE.\n\n**Available Apples (Crucial Targets Nearby):**\n(3, 3) - UP 2, RIGHT 1.\n(5, 2) - UP 1, RIGHT 2.\n(7, 2) - UP 1, RIGHT 4.\n(5, 0) - DOWN 1, RIGHT 2.\n\n**My Possible Moves (Head at (3, 1)):**\n1. **UP to (3, 2):** Safe. Moves towards A(3, 3) and A(5, 2)! This looks like a centralizing move!\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0):** Safe. Moves towards A(5, 0). A bit slow maybe?\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1):** SAFE, BUT IT'S MY OWN BODY! Wait, my body is [(2, 1), (2, 2)]. Yes, moving LEFT lands me directly on my own neck segment (2, 1)! **INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 AVOID LEFT!**\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Moves into open territory towards A(5, 0).\n\n**Opponent's Possible Moves (Head at (0, 8)):**\nThey are trapped against the left wall.\n1. **DOWN to (0, 7):** Safe. Continues hugging the wall.\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 8):** Safe. Tries to escape the corner.\n3. **UP/LEFT:** Illegal.\n\n**Collision Check (Simultaneous Move):**\n\nIf I go **UP to (3, 2)** (Best Option for now to consolidate center control):\n*   Opponent goes (0, 7) or (1, 8).\n*   No interaction. We maximize our position toward the nearest cluster of apples (3, 3) and (5, 2).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (4, 1)**:\n*   Opponent goes (0, 7) or (1, 8).\n*   No interaction. This path seems slightly less focused on the immediate high-value targets (3, 3).\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (3, 0)**:\n*   Opponent goes (0, 7) or (1, 8).\n*   No interaction. This sends me away from the (3, 3) cluster.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nWe need to pivot towards the central apples. Going **UP** to (3, 2) is the most direct line towards (3, 3) and (5, 2), while keeping us completely safe from our own body (since (2, 1) is now behind us on the left). If the opponent goes RIGHT to (1, 8), we have total freedom to continue the hunt next turn. If they go DOWN to (0, 7), they wall themselves in further while we claim the center!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Keep feeding aggressively towards the top-center apples (3, 3), (7, 7). We need to establish dominance high on the board before Snake #1 gets a chance to spread out. Our current shape is a nice defensive 'L' shape along the bottom left, which gives us safety against immediate corner traps. Keep the pressure ON!\n\nUP",

We are sitting pretty at (3, 2) and these high-value apples at (3, 3) and (5, 2) are calling our name! We gotta secure that central high ground!\n\n**CURRENT STATE REVIEW (After Turn 2 Move UP):**\nMy Head: (3, 2). Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1)]. Apples: 2. (Wait, my body list from the RATIONALE was slightly off based on the board update! Let's trust the visual BOARD STATE provided for Turn 3!)\n\n**Board State Check (Turn 3):**\nMy Head: (3, 2). Body: [(3, 1), (2, 1)].\nSnake #1 Head: (0, 6). Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8)].\n\n**Apple Targets:** (3, 3) is right there!\n\n**My Possible Moves (Head at (3, 2)):**\n1. **UP to (3, 3):** **CRITICAL MOVE!** This lands us directly on Apple A(3, 3)! We GROW! This is the move we MUST make if it's safe!\n2. **DOWN to (3, 1):** Safe. Moves back toward our tail end, not maximizing position.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 2):** Safe. My body is (3, 1), (2, 1). Moving to (2, 2) is safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Safe. Opens up lines toward (5, 2).\n\n**Opponent's Possible Moves (Head at (0, 6)):** They are still severely trapped by the left wall!\n1. **DOWN to (0, 5):** Safe. Continues wall-hugging.\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 6):** Safe. Tries to get out.\n3. **UP to (0, 7):** **DANGER!** This collides with their own body segment (0, 7)! **INSTANT DEATH for them! \ud83d\udc80** (Wait, opponent body is [(0, 7), (0, 8)]. If they move UP to (0, 7), they move into their own neck segment if the body shifts correctly. STANDARD rule: Moving into your own previous segment location is NOT instantly fatal unless you move directly backwards *into* the cell just vacated by your tail, or into any occupied segment. Let's assume they must avoid their entire body list: (0, 7) and (0, 8). So UP to (0, 7) is probably deadly collision with their own body unless the rules specify only the *current* body segments are hazards. Given standard Snake rules, moving onto (0, 7) should kill them if (0, 7) is still occupied or if moving into the new head position is one of the current body cells.)\n*Self-Correction on Opponent:* If they move UP to (0, 7), their old head (0, 6) becomes the new (0, 7). Their old neck (0, 7) is now the next segment. Moving directly onto (0, 7) means they move into their *current* body! **This must be death.** If they move RIGHT to (1, 6) or DOWN to (0, 5), they live.\n\n**Collision Check for MY MOVE (UP to (3, 3), Eating Apple):**\nIf I go **UP to (3, 3)**:\n*   If Opponent goes DOWN to (0, 5): I eat, I grow, I dominate mid-board. Safe!\n*   If Opponent goes RIGHT to (1, 6): I eat, I grow, I dominate mid-board. Safe!\n*   If Opponent goes UP to (0, 7) (and dies): I eat, I grow, I win the turn decisively! Safe!\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThis is a no-brainer! If **UP to (3, 3)** is safe, we must take the guaranteed apple and GROWTH advantage immediately! It drives us into the heart of the action, increasing our score and extending our life insurance policy (length)!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure the center apples (3, 3) and then pivot towards (5, 2) and (5, 3). We want to keep our body tight and avoid spreading too thin until we have a massive length advantage. Snake #1 is still struggling in the corner, let's make them pay for their hesitation by claiming territory UP HIGH!\n\nLet\u2019s get that *content*!\n\nUP",

We are TALLER, STRONGER, and ready to press the advantage! We are sitting at (3, 3) now, apples 4 to 3! Let's GOOOO!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (After Turn 3 Move UP):**\nMy Head: (3, 3). Body: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)]. Apples: 4.\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 6). Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]. Apples: 3. (Assuming they moved RIGHT to (1, 6) last turn to escape the corner, or DOWN to (0, 5) which still keeps them trapped on the left side. Let's look at the BOARD STATE provided which is the result of *both* moves!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (End of Turn 3 / Start of Turn 4):**\nMy Head: (3, 3)! (Confirmed with apple eaten status!)\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 6)! (This means they moved **RIGHT** last turn from (0, 6) into (1, 6). Phew, dodged a bullet, they didn't kill themselves trying that silly UP move!)\n\nOKAY! My new target rich environment surrounds me! Apples remaining nearby: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 2), (9, 2), (9, 7), etc... The juicy ones are (5, 2) and (5, 3)! We need to push RIGHT!\n\n**My Possible Moves (Head at (3, 3)):**\n1. **UP to (3, 4):** Safe. Positions us nicely for a future push to the top edge, but doesn't grab immediate fruit.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe. Backwards move into an already clear spot. Low priority.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the middle-left, but (2, 3) is currently empty.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 3):** **THE POWER MOVE!** This sets us up to sprint directly for Apple (5, 3) next turn! It opens up the entire right side corridor!\n\n**Opponent's Possible Moves (Head at (1, 6)):** They are out on the edge now, looking for space. They will definitely want to move UP towards (1, 7) or (1, 8) or maybe try to flank down towards (1, 5)!\n*   If they go UP to (1, 7): They gain altitude.\n*   If they go DOWN to (1, 5): They start moving down the board.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (2, 6): They try to break into the center!\n\n**Collision Check for MY MOVE (RIGHT to (4, 3)):**\nMy new head position (4, 3) needs to be checked against ALL possible enemy positions.\nEnemy positions are: (1, 7), (1, 5), (2, 6), or (0, 6) [if they move LEFT]. None of these overlap with (4, 3). We are SAFE!\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nWe need momentum! We are currently ahead in length due to the guaranteed growth! We MUST capitalize by immediately aiming for the next cluster of apples! Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) maximizes our path efficiency towards the central apples (5, 2) and (5, 3). We box #1 in by claiming the center territory! We are hunting!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turns 4-6):** Move RIGHT/UP/RIGHT to secure (5, 3) and then pivot down to (5, 2). Keep the body tight. If Snake #1 tries to play aggressively in the center, we are longer and can afford to trade positions safely, potentially boxing them against the centralized apples. We are the aggressor!\n\nRIGHT!\nRIGHT",

It's GO TIME!\n\n**CURRENT STATE REVIEW (Start of Turn 5):**\nMy Head: (4, 3). Length: 4 (3 body segments + 1 head segment).\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 6). Length: 4 (3 body segments + 1 head segment).\n\nApples near me: (5, 3) is looking MOUTH-WATERINGLY good! (5, 2) is a backup!\n\n**MY NEXT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (4, 3)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves us higher, good positional play, but delays direct apple contact.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves us lower, towards apple (5, 0) eventually, but (5, 2) is closer.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Backwards into my own body spot *last turn*. Since I moved from (3, 3) to (4, 3), moving back to (3, 3) is SAFE! It's a pivot point. But is it the most aggressive?\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** **EAT THE APPLE!** Immediate growth! We go to length 5! This is the CONTENT we came for!\n\n**OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (1, 6)):**\nThey are isolated on the left side. They likely want to push UP towards (1, 7) or (1, 8) or maybe push RIGHT to (2, 6) to try and cut off our central movement. If they push RIGHT to (2, 6), we are still safe from them if we go RIGHT to (5, 3) because the board is 10 wide!\n\n**COLLISION CHECK FOR MY MOVE (RIGHT to (5, 3) - EATING APPLE):**\n1.  **Off Board?** No. (5, 3) is clear.\n2.  **Into Myself?** No. Tail is at (3, 1). Safe.\n3.  **Into Snake #1 Head?** Snake #1 is moving from (1, 6). Worst case for them is moving to (2, 6), (1, 7), (0, 6) [oops, back into body], or (1, 5). They CANNOT reach (5, 3) this turn. We are SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\nWe didn't spend a turn positioning just to stand still! We position, then we STRIKE! Moving RIGHT to (5, 3) eats an apple, increases our length, and puts massive spatial pressure on Snake #1. We are now length 5, they are length 4. We are building an empire! Let's GET THAT GROWTH!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 5-7):**\nMove RIGHT to eat (5, 3). Next turn, look towards (5, 2) or perhaps UP towards (5, 4) depending on what Snake #1 does. We want to create a barrier near the center line (Y=3, Y=4) and force them to stay on the left edge or take massive risks trying to break through. Keep the body tight, keep the threats high! Domination incoming!\n\nLet's GOOOOOO! Eat that fruit!\n\nRIGHT",

Archrival Snake #0 thinks he's hot stuff but we're coming for that throne! We're at turn 5, tied at 3 apples \u2013 but not for long, we're about to feast! \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf4e Let's dissect this board like pros, no mercy out here!\n\nBoard is a 10x10 grid, top-right (9,9) bottom-left (0,0). Our snake head's at (1,5), body trailing back to tail at (0,7) \u2013 [(1,5) head, (1,6), (0,6), (0,7)]. Opp's head at (4,3), body left-down like [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]. Apples dropping all over \u2013 (2,5) right there begging to be eaten! MULTIPLE safe spots on board, but we're plotting like chess masters. Who else feels that energy? \ud83d\udd25\n\nAlright chat, break it down live: Examine ALL moves. UP from (1,5)? (1,6) \u2013 INTO OUR OWN BODY (1,6)! That's an instant L, game over, chat would roast me forever. \ud83d\udc80 Eliminate. DOWN to (1,4) \u2013 empty, looks safe, but check follow-ups: From (1,4), can't go up (back into head), left (0,4), right (2,4), down (1,3). Open, but opp's lurking at y=3 x=4 \u2013 potential head-on if I down and he right or something? Hmm, risky in tight spaces. Could trap us? LEFT to (0,5) \u2013 safe spot, yes. But follow-ups suck: UP dead to (0,6) own body, LEFT off-board instant deadzone, RIGHT back to (1,5) head \u2013 only DOWN looks good long-term? Nah, wailing in column 0? Bad trap potential, like boxing ourselves! \ud83d\udeab RIGHT to (2,5) \u2013 APPLE RIGHT THERE! Eat it, GROW to +1 apple (=4, pulling ahead!), new head (2,5), body grows without removing tail, now [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (0,6), (0,7)]. Boom, multi-way escapes: Up (2,6), right (3,5), down (2,4), left (1,5) dead. Perfect flexibility \u2013 not boxed! Closer to MORE apples like row 5 cluster or (2,3)/(7,2). Opp at (4,3) might eat his own (5,3), but we dodge head-ons easy. Ruthless plot: Eat, flank, force him into our territory for future boxers! Why hesitate when apple's calling? \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4f\n\nAmong safe (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2013 RIGHT wins: Eats apple NOW, boosts score, keeps options OPEN (no tight corridors), avoids own traps/deep dohopp, moves toward food wars. DOWN's okay but heads near opp's row \u2013 potential collision mess. LEFT? Temporary safe but dead-end vibes, trapping us for later rounds. Opp dies if he hits our growing body, remember that! We're staying alive to DOMINATE. Let's predict: If we RIGHT, opp probably RIGHT to (5,3) apple too \u2013 not colliding, but we edge ahead. If he goes elsewhere, we're golden. Safest path to victory: Keep growing, no deaths, box him in rows 2-5 later when bodies longer. This is our chance chat \u2013 who's with it? \ud83d\ude80\n\nLong-term strategy for next few turns (writin' this down to remind myself, chat!): Keep eating RIGHT or down-diagonal apples in row 5/4/3, grow to 6-8 apples advantage by turn 15. Man confidently position head near (3,5) or (2,4) to block opp's access to right apples, force him down/left into tight y=2 area \u2013 body-slam him into walls! Watch for head-ons, always leave 3+ escape routes. Ruthless: Lure him to apples we can cut off, starve him dead. No mercy, win at 150 if alive!\n\nRIGHT",

(6, 1) is also looking nice and central!\n\n**MY NEXT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (5, 3)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Good central positioning, keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** **EAT THE APPLE!** IMMEDIATE GROWTH! We go to Length 6! This is what we stream for! \ud83d\udcc8\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Backwards? No, that was our position *last* turn, but since we moved from (4, 3) to (5, 3), moving back to (4, 3) is SAFE! It's defensive but slow.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Safe. Expands right side, but (5, 2) is a guaranteed point!\n\n**OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 at (2, 5)):**\nThey are trapped on the left/mid-left. They are likely to push towards the top left corner or try to push RIGHT towards the center.\n*   If they go **UP** to (2, 6): They run right into their own body segment at (1, 6)! Wait, Snake #1 Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. If they go UP to (2, 6), they are SAFE from running into their own body! Phew.\n*   If they go **RIGHT** to (3, 5): This is the aggressive maneuver to try and cut us off centrally.\n*   If they go **DOWN** to (2, 4): Prepping to hit (5, 2) if we ignore it.\n*   If they go **LEFT** to (1, 5): Into their own body segment! **Snake #1 DIES if they go LEFT!** That's a gift! \ud83c\udf81\n\n**COLLISION CHECK FOR MY MOVE (DOWN to (5, 2) - EATING APPLE):**\n\n1.  **Off Board?** No. (5, 2) is clear.\n2.  **Into Myself?** No. Tail is far down at (3, 1). Safe.\n3.  **Into Snake #1 Head?** Snake #1 is likely moving from (2, 5). They *cannot* reach (5, 2) in one move. We are SAFE!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nForget defense, we are playing offense! We move DOWN to **(5, 2)**, eat the apple, grow to Length 6, and solidify our height advantage near the center! If Snake #1 dies trying to go LEFT, we win instantly! If they play defensively, their board space shrinks faster than ours because we are growing while they aren't! We are building a wall!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 6-8):**\nKeep pushing towards the apples on the bottom right quadrant ((6, 1), (5, 0), etc.) while keeping the body tight. We want to slowly force them toward the top ledge (Y=9) or the far left, trapping them against the wall. If we can secure (6, 1) next turn, we own the lower center!

We're tied at 4 apples each, but that changes TODAY \u2013 we're plotting like beasts to feast, flank, and force that archrival #0 into a corner! Board wide open for ruthless plays, our head at (2,5) itching for action. Opp's lurking at (5,3), eyes on that (5,2) apple, but we're smarter \u2013 we're boxing him, starving him, making him crash hard! Who else is hyped for the grind? Let's break this down turn 6, no BS, pure fire! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, analyze ALL moves like a pro \u2013 no throwaways, chat! UP from (2,5) to (2,6): Empty spot in y=6, yep, snake bodies at x=0-1 y=6 but not (2,6). Safe? Yeah, but follow-ups? U to (2,7), R to (3,6), D to (2,5) own body \ud83d\ude2c \u2013 only TWO escapes, and y=6's crowded with our tail vibes nearby. No apples right there, just dead-end potential later. Why limit ourselves when we're kings? \ud83d\udeab Eliminate from elite, chat!\n\nDOWN to (2,4): CLEAR board, no bodies, no walls. Epic follow-ups: D to (2,3) \u2013 BAM, APPLE NEXT TURN ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e Grow instantly, +1 apple to 5, pull ahead! L to (1,4) empty, R to (3,4) empty. THREE solid escapes, flexible AF! Keeps us in the left apple cluster madness \u2013 (2,3) begging BE EATEN, more at (0,1), (5,1), (7,2)... we're positioning PERFECT near (2,4) like last plan \u2013 BLOCK opp's hopes of raiding our turf! Opp at (5,3) might DOWN to (5,2) eat and tie, but we counter with (2,3), then pivot to starve him. Who's feeling that power move? \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT? Instant own-body crash at (1,5), game over. Trash, deleted! \ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT to (3,5): Open, safe, our tail at x=1 y=5 but not here. Follow-ups: U to (3,6), R to (4,5), D to (3,4) \u2013 THREE escapes, nice! But closer to opp's lane, he might RIGHT to (6,3) and flank us. Apple (2,3) is LEFT of here, so we'd detour two turns to eat it: FROM (3,5) D to (3,4), NEXT LEFT to (2,4), THEN D \u2013 nah, too slow! Right side's sparse on apples, why cede the left feast? Opp could outmaneuver us there. Not ideal, chat \u2013 we're not surrendering opportunities! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSafe moves: UP (limpd but limited), DOWN (FIRE \u2013 eats close, open options, blocks opp), RIGHT (decent but slower growth). DOWN WINS EASY: Apples incoming NOW, future traps minimized (board opens low y's), NO head-ons obvious if opp dives right or down. We're ruthless \u2013 eat (2,3) next, body-slam opp into y=2 tight zone later, force him crash walls or our tail! By turn 10-15, we're at 6-8 apples LEAD, he starves dead. No hesitation, win at 150 alive! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term strategy for next few turns: Eat the apple at (2,3) NEXT TURN with DOWN, position aggressively around y=4 x=2-3 to cut off opp's path to our left apples like (0,1) and (5,1). Grow body 2-4 segments in 5-7 turns by feasting left clusters, then flank right to block his growth. Always scan for head-ons, leave 3+ routes open.

LFG! \ud83d\udcc8 Snake #1 is still Length 4, we are flexing that size advantage!\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nMy Head: (5, 2)\nMy Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)] (Length 6!)\nSnake #1 Head: (2, 4) (Assuming they went DOWN last turn, avoiding the suicide LEFT move!) Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (2, 4)):**\nThey are stuck on the left half. If they went DOWN to (2, 4), they are now positioning defensively near the center. If they go RIGHT to (3, 4), they try to intercept our central expansion. If they go UP to (2, 5), they are just circling.\n\n**MY TARGETS:**\nThe bottom right is stacked with apples: (6, 1), (5, 0), (7, 2). If we can grab (6, 1) next, we secure that quadrant.\n\n**MY NEXT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (5, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** Backwards into my own body! **INSTANT DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** Puts us close to (5, 0) and (6, 1) but exposes us slightly if Snake #1 tries to loop wide right. Safe movement path generally.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe. Keeps us central, good pressure.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe. Expands towards the bottom right apple cluster (6, 1). This looks promising for setting up the next harvest!\n\n**COLLISION/TRAP CHECK (Assuming Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3, 4) - Aggressive):**\nIf Snake #1 goes (2, 4) -> (3, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2): We are nowhere near each other. Safe.\n\n**COLLISION/TRAP CHECK (Assuming Snake #1 moves UP to (2, 5) - Circling):**\nIf Snake #1 goes (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2): Still safe.\n\nThe key is to keep moving towards the next food source while maintaining a wide base, not letting the body snake curl up too much. Since (5, 3) is a body part, moving towards the bottom right (6, 2 or 5, 1) seems the most greedy and aggressive line of play to secure the next apple!\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (6, 2)** positions us perfectly for (6, 1) next turn, or we can pivot UP if Snake #1 starts encroaching aggressively. We are bigger, we dictate the pace! Let's go for maximum points!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 7-10):**\nSecure (6, 1) next turn if possible. If Snake #1 tries to push towards the center (e.g., (4, 3) or (4, 4)), we use our length advantage to start creating impassable barriers on the X-axis (columns 5 and 6), forcing them into the top or left side walls. Keep expanding downwards until we run out of space or food. We want to create a massive, unassailable blob!\n\nRIGHT is the move! Let's eat! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

We went RIGHT, positioning ourselves for the bottom right banquet! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's see where we landed!\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO CHAT! We're on Turn 7! That DOWN move was MONUMENTAL! We ate that apple at (5, 2) and grew to Length 6! LFG! \ud83d\udcc8 Snake #1 is still Length 4, we are flexing that size advantage!\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nMy Head: (5, 2)\nMy Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)] (Length 6!)\nSnake #1 Head: (2, 4) (Assuming they went DOWN last turn, avoiding the suicide LEFT move!) Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (2, 4)):**\nThey are stuck on the left half. If they went DOWN to (2, 4), they are now positioning defensively near the center. If they go RIGHT to (3, 4), they try to intercept our central expansion. If they go UP to (2, 5), they are just circling.\n\n**MY TARGETS:**\nThe bottom right is stacked with apples: (6, 1), (5, 0), (7, 2). If we can grab (6, 1) next, we secure that quadrant.\n\n**MY NEXT MOVE ANALYSIS (Head at (5, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** Backwards into my own body! **INSTANT DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 NOPE.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** Puts us close to (5, 0) and (6, 1) but exposes us slightly if Snake #1 tries to loop wide right. Safe movement path generally.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe. Keeps us central, good pressure.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe. Expands towards the bottom right apple cluster (6, 1). This looks promising for setting up the next harvest!\n\n**COLLISION/TRAP CHECK (Assuming Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3, 4) - Aggressive):**\nIf Snake #1 goes (2, 4) -> (3, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2): We are nowhere near each other. Safe.\n\n**COLLISION/TRAP CHECK (Assuming Snake #1 moves UP to (2, 5) - Circling):**\nIf Snake #1 goes (2, 4) -> (2, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 2): Still safe.\n\nThe key is to keep moving towards the next food source while maintaining a wide base, not letting the body snake curl up too much. Since (5, 3) is a body part, moving towards the bottom right (6, 2 or 5, 1) seems the most greedy and aggressive line of play to secure the next apple!\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (6, 2)** positions us perfectly for (6, 1) next turn, or we can pivot UP if Snake #1 starts encroaching aggressively. We are bigger, we dictate the pace! Let's go for maximum points!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 7-10):**\nSecure (6, 1) next turn if possible. If Snake #1 tries to push towards the center (e.g., (4, 3) or (4, 4)), we use our length advantage to start creating impassable barriers on the X-axis (columns 5 and 6), forcing them into the top or left side walls. Keep expanding downwards until we run out of space or food. We want to create a massive, unassailable blob!\n\nRIGHT is the move! Let's eat! \ud83d\udcb0\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n---\n**CURRENT TURN 8 ANALYSIS**\nI AM AT HEAD: (6, 2).\nMy Body includes: (5, 2), (5, 3)...\nSnake #1 is at HEAD: (2, 3). Body includes: (2, 4), (2, 5)...\n\n**APPLE TARGETS NEAR ME:** (6, 1) is RIGHT THERE! (5, 0) right below it! This is prime real estate!\n\n**SELF-CHECK (Starting from MY current HEAD (6, 2)):**\n1. **UP to (6, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the lowest apple (5, 0). Keeps space open.\n2. **DOWN to (6, 1):** **APPLE!** (6, 1) is an apple! If I go DOWN, I eat, grow to Length 7, and secure that bottom corner! My tail needs to survive the move though! My tail is currently at (3, 2) based on the board state given (which seems to conflict with the previous rationale's body list for the last move, I MUST trust the BOARD STATE provided for THIS turn: Head (6, 2), Body [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)] - Wait, my body length is 6 including the head, 1 segment short of the previous rationale's assumed length 7! Let's re-read the Board State provided for Turn 8:\n    Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 2), Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]. Length 5! (5 segments listed + head = 6 total segments). The last apple collected must have been turn 6, or the board state reflects a stale/off-by-one body count from the rationale!\n\n    ***Crucial Decision Point: Trust the BOARD STATE listed for Turn 8 over the Rationale text from Turn 7***\n    **BOARD STATE (Turn 8):** HEAD (6, 2). Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]. Tail is (3, 2).\n    My next move cannot be into (5, 2) or (5, 3) (future tail moves). I cannot move BACKWARDS to (X,Y) if (X,Y) is (5, 2).\n    **Moving (6, 2) -> (5, 2) is moving directly back into the cell immediately behind the head.** **INSTANT DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 2):** **SELF-CRASH!** This is the segment right behind me. NO GO!\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe. Moves us towards the right edge, away from potential (4, 2) future body segments if we move too much. Doesn't grab the apple at (6, 1).\n5. **UP to (6, 3):** Safe. Keeps options open.\n\nSince LEFT is a suicide move (moving into my own tail segment (5, 2)), I am severely restricted!\n\n**SAFE MOVES for HEAD (6, 2):** UP (6, 3), RIGHT (7, 2), DOWN (6, 1 - EAT APPLE!).\n\n**ANALYZING OPPONENT (Snake #1)**: HEAD: (2, 3). They are on the left. We just moved RIGHT last turn, they will likely move to counteract centralization or secure food.\nPossible moves for #1 (2, 3):\n*   UP to (2, 4) (Into their own body segment from the board state? No, (2, 4) is listed in their body list, so (2, 3) UP is safe if (2, 4) is not the head location! Board state says #1 Head (2, 3), Body [(2, 4), (2, 5)...]. Moving UP to (2, 4) hits their own body! **SUICIDE FOR #1 IF THEY GO UP!**\n*   DOWN to (2, 2): Safe. Moves them away from the center cluster towards the bottom wall.\n*   LEFT to (1, 3): Safe. Pushes them further left.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 3): Safe. Pushes them centrally! (3, 3) is MY body! If #1 goes RIGHT, they hit my body at (3, 3)! **#1 DIES IF THEY GO RIGHT!**\n\n**Collision Check with Snake #1 (Assuming they want to survive):**\nIf #1 goes DOWN (2, 2) or LEFT (1, 3), they survive.\n\n**MY BEST OPTION:**\nI MUST grab the apple at (6, 1) by moving **DOWN to (6, 1)**! It's an immediate score increase, crucial for breaking the tie in apples (5 vs 5) and maximizing size advantage! Since LEFT is death, DOWN is the premium choice!\n\nIf I go DOWN (6, 1):\nI collect apple (6, 1) -> I grow longer!\nIf Snake #1 goes UP (2, 4) or RIGHT (3, 3): They die!\nIf Snake #1 goes DOWN (2, 2) or LEFT (1, 3): They live.\n\nIf #1 dies, I live, I get the apple, I win the immediate point race! This is huge! Even if they live, I secure necessary food right now before the space gets too tight.\n\nLet's go for the **CONTENT!** DOWN TO (6, 1)!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 8-10):**\nSecure (6, 1) this turn -> Grow! Then evaluate if we can immediately snipe (5, 0) next turn, or if we need to move UP to (6, 2) to start walling off the right side defensively. Since we are growing, we must be careful about curling into the center again, but the bottom wall provides excellent support for now. Look to slowly push Snake #1 towards the top-left corner!\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

We are now up 7 apples to 5! The size difference is starting to SHOW! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's see where the dust settled from that simultaneous move!\n\n**MY NEW POSITION (Turn 9):**\nI moved DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1) and ATE!\nCurrent Head: (6, 1). My length increased!\nMy Body must now reflect collecting that apple. My previous tail at (3, 2) has been pushed back one position, and the new head (6, 1) is where the action is!\n\n**OPPONENT'S POSITION (Turn 9):**\nSnake #1 Head was (2, 3).\nIf they went (2, 2) (DOWN), their new head is (2, 2).\nIf they went (1, 3) (LEFT), their new head is (1, 3).\nIf they went (2, 4) (UP) or (3, 3) (RIGHT), they died hitting my body at (3, 3) or their own body at (2, 4)! We need to trust the board state provided at the top of this turn for the TRUE positions!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (TURN 9):**\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (6, 1). Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]. (Length 7 counting head!)\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 3). Body: [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]. (Length 6 counting head!)\n\nAHA! Snake #1 chose **LEFT** to (1, 3)! Smart move, avoiding my body segments and the suicide UPs/RIGHTS we identified! They are trying to hug the left wall! Meanwhile, I ate that apple and secured the bottom right quadrant! My body is now 7 segments long! They only have 6!\n\n**APPLE HUNT (Turn 9):**\nAvailable apples near me: (5, 0) is RIGHT THERE! (7, 2) is slightly further! We are perfectly positioned to snag (5, 0) next turn!\n\n**CURRENT HEAD LOCATION: (6, 1).**\n\n**SELF-CHECK (From (6, 1)):**\n1. **UP to (6, 2):** This is the segment immediately behind my head! **INSTANT DEATH!** \ud83d\udc80 NO GO!\n2. **DOWN to (6, 0):** Safe. Moves us towards the bottom edge, but (5, 0) is right there! Moving down here means we miss (5, 0) if we can't reach it next turn.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 1):** Safe. This opens up a direct path to (5, 0) NEXT turn if opponent doesn't interfere!\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Safe. Expands right, slightly away from the next prize.\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (1, 3)):**\nThey are hugging the left side, near apples (0, 1), (0, 9). They are likely planning to move UP to (1, 4) or DOWN to (1, 2) to stay vertical, or perhaps LEFT to (0, 3) to get near the wall apples.\n\n**COLLISION/PRESSURE CHECK:**\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 1), I maintain strong central pressure and put myself in range for (5, 0). Snake #1 is too far away (1, 3) to cause any immediate threat by moving toward me. If they move (1, 3) -> (1, 4) (UP), they stay far left. If they move LEFT to (0, 3), they are safe.\n\nGoing UP (6, 2) is suicide, so my choice is between DOWN (6, 0), LEFT (5, 1), or RIGHT (7, 1).\n\nGrabbing (5, 0) is the highest priority content maker!\n*   If I go DOWN (6, 0): Next turn I can go LEFT (5, 0) to eat! (Head: (6, 0) -> Left to (5, 0)). This is a 2-move approach.\n*   If I go LEFT (5, 1): Next turn I can go DOWN ((5, 1) -> (5, 0)) to eat! This is also a 2-move approach.\n\nWhich path leads to more safety?\nPath A (Down -> Left): Head ends up at (5, 0), eating. Body is (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)... Safe path overall.\nPath B (Left -> Down): Head ends up at (5, 0), eating. Body is (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)... Also safe path overall.\n\nPath B (LEFT to (5, 1)) keeps my head slightly more central than Path A (DOWN to (6, 0)), giving me more options if the apple at (4, 6) or (7, 2) suddenly becomes more valuable, or if Snake #1 tries to invade the middle. Maintaining central flexibility is key! We want to control the entire map, not just the bottom corner!\n\nLet's move **LEFT** to (5, 1)! Set up the one-two punch for the next apple! LFG!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 9-12):**\nSecure (5, 0) next turn. Then pivot UP towards (5, 1) and (4, 1) to start building a solid wall across rows 0 and 1, completely cutting off the bottom quadrant from Snake #1, even if they try to sneak down the left side. Keep denying them movement options while we expand vertically! We are the bigger snake, we build the cages!\n\nLEFT\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are on TURN 10! We made the calculated move to **LEFT** last turn, setting up a direct assault on that (5, 0) apple! Did it work? We gotta trust the simultaneous move logic!\n\n**MY POSITION (Turn 10):**\nI moved LEFT from (6, 1) to **(5, 1)**.\nIf (5, 0) was available, I would have eaten it! Since my body list didn't change size announced here, I assume either:\n1. Snake #1 ate (5, 0).\n2. Or, the board state provided *already* reflects the results of Turn 9, and I landed safely at (5, 1) without eating.\n\nLet's look at the BOARD STATE provided for Turn 10:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (5, 1). Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)].\nWait, hold up! My body list implies I *did not* eat! If I moved from (6, 1) LEFT to (5, 1) and ate (5, 0), my body should have grown, and my old head (6, 1) should now be the second segment, and my tail would have been slightly longer (or the tail remains static but the length increases).\n\nLet's re-read the RATIONALE for Turn 9: I moved DOWN from (6, 2) to (6, 1) and ATE.\nMY NEW POSITION (Turn 9): Head (6, 1). Body: [(6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]. (Length 7 counting head!)\nThen on Turn 10, I moved LEFT to (5, 1). If I ATE (5, 0) this time, my length increases again.\n\nHowever, the **CURRENT BOARD STATE FOR TURN 10** says:\n*   Your Head: (5, 1).\n*   Apples: 7. If I had eaten (5, 0) it would be 8!\n*   Body: Length 7 segments *plus* the head = 8 total segments. (If I ate last turn, I should have 8 segments total).\n\nIf my current length is 7 segments (head + 6 body parts shown here): [(5, 1) Head, (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)] - wait, that is 8 numbers listed if we count the head. The list provided for my body has 7 items. If the head is the 8th segment, the length is **8**. This implies I **DID NOT EAT** on Turn 10 when moving to (5, 1).\n\nConclusion: The apple at (5, 0) is STILL THERE, buried under my body, or Snake #1 got it first!\n\nLet's check the board visual against the apple list:\nApples remaining: (9, 2), (9, 7), (5, 0)-GONE?, (8, 6), (9, 1), (7, 2), (7, 7), (9, 3), (0, 1), (9, 8), (9, 6), (0, 9), (4, 6), (3, 5), (6, 6).\nLook at the visual board. **A @ (5, 0) IS MISSING!**\n\nIf (5, 0) is gone, Snake #1 must have eaten it! If Snake #1 ate (5, 0), they now have 6 apples. My score is 7. Wait, the scoreboard says: You: 7, Snake #1: 5.\n\n**CRITICAL CONFLICT CHECK:**\n1.  If Snake #1 ate (5, 0), they should have 6 points! Scoreboard says 5.\n2.  If I ate (5, 0) by moving (6, 1) -> (5, 1) (which I didn't plan for as my target was 5,0), I would have 8 points! Scoreboard says 7.\n\n**ASSUMPTION:** The provided BOARD STATE and SCOREBOARD are the absolute truth for Turn 10, and my movement on Turn 9 resulted in landing at (6, 1) safely, and Snake #1 landed safely at (1, 3). My move *last turn* was the rationale I wrote, resulting in my head at (6, 1). **My move THIS turn (T10) resulted in landing at (5, 1) as per the body state provided.** Since the apple count hasn't changed, I did *not* eat this turn either. (5, 0) must have been eaten by Snake #1 on Turn 9, but the scoreboard didn't update correctly from 5 to 6, OR the apple visual marker is wrong, and it was just eaten by Snake #1 to hit 5 (which makes no sense)?\n\nI MUST proceed based on the provided current state: Head (5, 1), Apple Count 7. Snake #1 Head (1, 2), Count 5. **(5, 0) is NOT an apple.**\n\n**CURRENT BOARD HEAD: (5, 1)**. Snake is long, relatively safe, controlling the bottom/center right.\n**Snake #1 Head: (1, 2)**. They moved DOWN from (1, 3) (they must have moved DOWN to get to (1, 2) from (1, 3) if they didn't eat). They are hugging the left wall.\n\n**NEXT APPLE TARGETS:**\n1. (7, 2) - A bit further, requires moving toward the center-right edge, but offers good expansion. Distance: 2 moves (Right, Down/Up, Right).\n2. (0, 1) - On the left wall, near Snake #1. Dangerous to approach.\n3. (4, 6) - High priority! Centrally located, getting higher up opens up map control. Distance: 3 moves (Up, Up, Left/Right).\n\n**SELF-CHECK (From (5, 1)):**\nBody segments around me: (6, 1) is UP.\n1. **UP to (5, 2):** INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 My segment immediately behind me! NO GO!\n2. **DOWN to (5, 0):** Safe! This puts me on the 0 line, near wall.\n3. **LEFT to (4, 1):** Safe! Moves me toward the wall/center, opposite enemy.\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Safe! Moving back to where I just was.\n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS (Snake #1 at (1, 2)):**\nThey are small and hugging the wall. They will likely move UP to (1, 3) or (1, 4) to expand vertically, or perhaps LEFT to (0, 2) to snake along the edge. They are not currently threatening my central body.\n\n**STRATEGY: Control the Center High Ground!**\nWe have secured the lower board effectively by building that wall off our body. It's time to expand UPwards aggressively towards (4, 6) and utilize our superior size advantage! (7, 2) is too close to the right wall and might box us in prematurely. (0, 1) is bad territory adjacency.\n\nLet's aim **UP** to **(5, 2)**? WAIT! (5, 2) is occupied by my BODY segment! I cannot go UP!\n\nRethink safety check: My body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)].\nHead is (5, 1).\n(5, 2) IS MY BODY! I CANNOT MOVE UP! My body list confirms this: (5, 2) is my 3rd segment.\n\nThis means I was WRONG about my body segments adjacency in the self-check above. I must be extremely careful!\n\n**RE-CHECKings from (5, 1):**\n1. **UP to (5, 2):** BODY HIT. **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80\n2. **DOWN to (5, 0):** Safe. (Toward the floor line).\n3. **LEFT to (4, 1):** Safe. (Toward the left edge).\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 1):** BODY HIT. (6, 1) is my immediate next segment! **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80\n\nOH MY GOD! My options are severely limited due to my body placement post-eating spree! My move two turns ago resulted in a body shape that pins me! I can only go DOWN or LEFT!\n\n**MOVE SELECTION (Must be DOWN or LEFT):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 0):** We are now on the absolute bottom edge. We can turn Left/Right next turn, but we are constrained vertically until we dump a tail segment. This move sets up an easy pivot left: (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) etc.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 1):** This moves us away from the enemy, more centrally located, and points us slightly diagonally toward (4, 6).\n\nThe primary threat is *not* Snake #1 currently; it's getting walled in by my own bulk or the map edges. Moving LEFT to (4, 1) preserves more horizontal options and allows us to snake up the center line quicker than committing to the bottom wall. If we go LEFT, next turn we can go UP towards (4, 2) or possibly LEFT again towards (3, 1) if (4, 2) isn't available.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5, 0), next turn we can go LEFT to (4, 0). This is slow progress towards the middle.\n\n**PLAN: Go LEFT to (4, 1).** We need to snake upwards safely. Let's use the central column paths to climb towards the high-value apples (4, 6).\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 10-13):**\nPivot UPWARD aggressively towards (4, 6)! Move LEFT (current location) -> UP (4, 2) or LEFT (3, 1). Since the enemy is far left, we can afford to carve a clean upward path on the center-left side. Avoid the right edge until we are much longer, as there are fewer apples there to justify the commitment. Keep cycling around the center mass.\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My analysis of my body structure showed that going UP or RIGHT from (5, 1) would lead to instant self-destruction! \ud83d\ude31 That was a nail-biter, glad we checked the tape before moving blind!\n\nCurrent position: Head (5, 1). Body has us sandwiched by our own mass at (5, 2) UP and (6, 1) RIGHT.\nOnly safe moves are DOWN to (5, 0) or LEFT to (4, 1).\n\n**Enemy Analysis (Snake #1 at (1, 2))**\nThey just moved down last turn (assuming they didn't eat to stay at 5 apples). If they move UP to (1, 3), they are safe. If they move LEFT to (0, 2), they are safe. They aren't directly threatening my core mass right now, but they are slowly boxing themselves into the lower-left corner. Good news for us, less competition for the central high-value apples!\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\nThe big target is still (4, 6). We need to climb!\n\n**Move Comparison:**\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 0):** Closes us off to the bottom wall. Slows vertical progress significantly. We'd have to snake right/left along the floor before climbing again.\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 1):** This is the path we wanted last turn before realizing we were body-locked! This moves us toward the center line (X=4) and allows us to pivot UP next turn towards (4, 2) or maintain LEFT toward (3, 1) while marching toward the high ground (4, 6). This is proactive map control!\n\n**Collision Check (If we go LEFT to (4, 1)):**\n*   Snake #1 is at (1, 2). They would have to also move LEFT to (0, 2) OR UP to (1, 3) to avoid me, or they'd hit nothing. If they move LEFT to (0, 2), and I move LEFT to (4, 1), we are miles apart. No collision risk!\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turns 11-13):**\nWe MUST climb to the middle layers. Move LEFT/UP sequence is the key. We will aim for (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) or similar progression towards the high apples (4, 6), (6, 6). We need to establish dominance above Y=5 before the map shrinks too much.

We're up 7 apples to their 6! We are PREDATORS! \ud83d\ude08\n\nMy head is now at **(3, 1)**. My body is: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)].\n\nEnemy Snake #1 head is at **(0, 1)**. Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]. They are tucked into that corner, which is a liability if we can trap them!\n\n### Board Analysis & Apple Hunt\n\nWe are sitting low at Y=1. We MUST climb. The next obvious move sequence should target moving UP towards Y=2, Y=3, and eventually snagging those central apples like (4, 6) and (6, 6).\n\n**Reachable/Priority Apples:**\n1. (5, 0) - Right next to us, accessible if we move DOWN. But moving down is giving up board control! NO THANKS!\n2. (9, 2) - Too far.\n3. (7, 2) - Getting closer!\n4. (3, 5) - The ultimate goal for vertical climb.\n\n### Simultaneous Movement Check (The Crux of the Problem!)\n\nWe need to predict Snake #1's move. They are currently at (0, 1).\n\n**Snake #1 Potential Moves (from (0, 1)):**\n*   **UP to (0, 2):** Keeps them hugging the left wall, safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 1):** They would collide with their own tail segment! **UNSAFE!** (Wait, (1, 1) is their T1, so moving RIGHT to (1, 1) would be running into their own body segment listed at T1. OOF. Let's re-verify the body list: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)...]. Yes, moving RIGHT to (1, 1) from (0, 1) results in Head hitting Body segment (1, 1). **Snake #1 DIES if they go RIGHT.**\n*   **DOWN to (0, 0):** Safe, stays on board.\n*   **LEFT:** Off the board. **DEAD.**\n\nSo, Snake #1 is almost certainly going UP to (0, 2) or DOWN to (0, 0). They are trying to survive in that corner! If they go UP, they are setting up a sequence to climb the left wall. If they go DOWN, they hit the bottom wall next turn.\n\n**My Potential Moves (from (3, 1)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):**\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* Safe. (3, 2) is clear.\n    *   *Enemy Collision Check:* If they go UP to (0, 2), we are miles apart. If they go DOWN to (0, 0), we are safe. This is a strong climbing move!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):**\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* Safe. But this wastes time! We eat (5, 0) later, but RIGHT NOW we need height! Pass.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):**\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* Safe. This moves us toward the enemy's side, but we don't want to get boxed with them yet. We want height first!\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):**\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* We just came from (4, 1) last turn! This is moving BACKWARDS into our own body segment (that was T1, now T2)! **INSTANT DEATH!** \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab\n    *   Wait, let's re-check the body list from Turn 11 rationale: Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)]. Head was (5, 1). We moved LEFT to (4, 1). So my new head position is (4, 1).\n    *   **Rethink Current Head Position:** My head is now at **(3, 1)** because the RATIONALE described the move *TO* (4, 1) but the actual move listed at the top was **LEFT** from (5, 1) to (4, 1), and the body list shows the current head as (3, 1).\n    *   **THERE IS A DISCREPANCY!** Rationale says last move was LEFT from (5, 1) -> (4, 1). But the INPUT SCOREBOARD says HEAD is **(3, 1)**.\n    *   **I MUST TRUST THE SCOREBOARD DATA OVER THE RATIONALE IF THEY CONFLICT FOR CURRENT STATE!**\n    *   Current Head: (3, 1). Last move was LEFT from (4, 1) -> (3, 1). This means my previous move was LEFT (Turn 11).\n\nLet's recalculate based on Head=(3, 1) and Body's tail endpoint:\nIf I moved LEFT to (3, 1) this turn (Turn 11):\n*   Previous Head must have been (4, 1).\n*   Previous Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (X, Y)].\n*   The provided body list: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)] does NOT match the head (3, 1) if the last move was LEFT from (4, 1). **The body list must reflect position *AFTER* the move was executed.**\n\n**ASSUMPTION:** The HEAD (3, 1) and BODY list provided in the SCOREBOARD are the ABSOLUTE TRUTH for the START of TURN 12.\nMy tail segment has shrunk/moved to the end of the list, and the new head is (3, 1).\nThe movement that got us to (3, 1) from a previous cell X must leave the next cell (4, 1) available for me to move into next turn, UNLESS (4, 1) is now part of my body.\nCurrent Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3)].\nThe cell **(4, 1)**, which was occupied by the segment just behind the head *before* the move, is now the first segment *after* the head! **This means my previous move was NOT backwards, and the position is valid.**\n\nOkay, my HEAD is **(3, 1)**.\nMy immediate neighbors are:\n*   UP: (3, 2) - Clear\n*   DOWN: (3, 0) - Clear\n*   LEFT: (2, 1) - Clear\n*   RIGHT: (4, 1) - **MY OWN BODY!** (This is the segment immediately behind me).\n\n### FINAL MOVE DECISION for Turn 12\n\n**Rule Check:** Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head) is DEAD.\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 1) is moving into my own segment! **If I move RIGHT, I DIE!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nThis severely limits options!\n1. **RIGHT to (4, 1):** DEATH by self-collision. NO.\n2. **DOWN to (3, 0):** Safe, but loses height.\n3. **LEFT to (2, 1):** Safe. Moves toward the center-left X-axis. Good for maneuvering around the corner enemy.\n4. **UP to (3, 2):** Safe. The prime climbing move!\n\n**Enemy Analysis Revisited (Snake #1 at (0, 1)):**\nThey WILL NOT be able to collide with me easily, regardless of their move (UP to (0, 2) or DOWN to (0, 0)).\n\nIf I go **UP to (3, 2)**: I gain critical height. I'm aiming for (3, 3) next turn provided (3, 3) is empty and (4, 2) is clear to pivot. This sets up a clear path toward Apple (3, 5) and beyond! This is aggressive, proactive chess! \u265f\ufe0f\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (2, 1)**: I stay low. I can then go UP to (2, 2). This feels slower than just going UP now while the path is clear.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We are bigger, we leverage space. We GO UP! Clock is ticking, those high apples won't wait!\n\nLONG TERM PLAN (Turns 12-14): Establish dominance on the Y=2/Y=3 plane. Move UP to (3, 2). Next turn, evaluate the path to (3, 3) or pivot RIGHT towards the centralized apples if the enemy stays confined. We must secure the middle ground before the map shrinks too much. Today, we climb! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2640\ufe0f GLORIOUS CLIMB!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We are back on the grind! Turn 13! We just made a HUGE strategic move UP to (3, 2) based on my last thinking, trying to secure that vertical space! Now we see what the consequences were! We are up 7 to 6! We are the MIGHTY TORTOISE! \ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udca8\n\n### Turn 13 Analysis: Where are we now?\n\nThe input provided shows my current state *at the start* of Turn 13, BEFORE I make my move! My last move was UP from (3, 1) to **(3, 2)**.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK (Based on provided board, assuming my last move resulted in Head=(3, 2)):**\n*   My Head: (3, 2).\n*   My Body: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)] (Length 7 segments + Head = 8 total length. Apples collected: 7. Correct!)\n\n**Enemy State Check:**\n*   Snake #1 Head: (0, 0). Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. Apples: 6.\n\nIf my last move was UP to (3, 2), then the enemy's last move must have resulted in them moving to (0, 0).\n*   If they were at (0, 1) last turn (Turn 11), moving DOWN to (0, 0) was one of their predicted safe options! Good move on their part to stay safe!\n\n### Apple Check & Danger Zones\n\n**Apples near me:**\n1. (4, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7) - High priority in the center-right.\n2. (7, 2), (7, 7) - Further right.\n3. (3, 5) - Directly above me, the next major target if I keep climbing!\n\n**My Position (3, 2):** I am perfectly situated to start climbing towards (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5)! This is excellent board control!\n\n**Enemy Position (0, 0):** They are completely trapped in the bottom-left corner! They are essentially one turn away from the wall in every direction except UP.\n\n### Opponent Forecasting (Enemy's Move from (0, 0))\n\n**Snake #1 Potential Moves (from (0, 0)):**\n*   **UP to (0, 1):** This means moving directly into their body segment (0, 1)! **INSTANT DEATH!** \u2620\ufe0f Unless (0, 1) was the segment that just shifted to the TAIL, this is usually suicide unless the body list is only 1 segment long, which it isn't. Let's check their body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)...]. Yes, (0, 1) is their T1 segment. **If they move UP, SNAKE #1 DIES!**\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 0):** Safe move. Keeps them trying to escape the corner along the bottom edge.\n*   **DOWN/LEFT:** Off the board. DEAD.\n\n**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH!** Snake #1 is forced to move **RIGHT to (1, 0)** or die by moving UP! If they go RIGHT, they are now at (1, 0).\n\n### My Move Decision (From (3, 2))\n\nWe have supreme advantage here. We must capitalize on the enemy being so restricted!\n\n**My Options from (3, 2):**\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** Climbs directly toward (3, 5), excellent.\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* Safe. (3, 3) is clear.\n    *   *Enemy Collision Check:* If they go RIGHT to (1, 0), we are safe distance-wise. If they somehow went UP and died, we still win by default/score difference if we eat an apple!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** Retreating. BAD. We just climbed here!\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** Opens up a pivot path in the middle left. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** Moving towards center mass, good pathing to (4, 6).\n    *   *Self-Collision Check:* (4, 2) is clear! Wait, my body list: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)]. Cell (4, 2) is clear!\n\n**Comparison: UP (3, 3) vs RIGHT (4, 2)**\nGoing UP keeps us focused on the vertical line towards (3, 5).\nGoing RIGHT moves us towards the cluster of apples (4, 6), (6, 6). This might be better for immediate apple acquisition. If we move to (4, 2), we can go (4, 3) next (which is currently occupied by my tail segment (5, 3) -> (4, 3) if we update tail correctly, but my body list shows the tail at (5, 3) and the segment behind my previous head (3, 1) is (4, 1)). **Let's confirm (4, 2) is clear.** Yes, it appears clear on the map ASCII!\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 2), I am poised to sweep right toward the central action while the enemy is recovering from their corner mistake. Let's GO RIGHT and grab space! We don't want to linger directly vertical if the board opens up horizontally!\n\n### Long Term Plan for Turns 13-15\n\nEnemy is either already dead (if they went UP) or is forced to hug the bottom edge (if they went RIGHT to (1, 0)). We NEED to secure apples near the center now before the board closes in! Moving RIGHT to (4, 2) sets a perfect trajectory for eating (4, 6) or pivoting back UP towards (3, 5) later if needed. We are expanding our dominance! Let's secure the CENTER FIRE POWER! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT\n**(4, 2) - Set the tone for the mid-game! LET'S GO!**\n\nRIGHT",

Let's see what chaos unfolded!\n\n### Turn 14 Analysis: Where are we at?\n\nMy Head is now at **(4, 2)**.\nEnemy Snake #1 Head was at (0, 0) last turn.\n\n**The Critical Enemy Move Forecast from Turn 13:**\nMy analysis predicted Snake #1 was FORCED to move **RIGHT to (1, 0)** to avoid hitting its head segment at (0, 1) by going UP.\n\n**Checking the Board State Provided for Turn 14:**\n*   **MY Head:** (4, 2) - Confirms my move RIGHT!\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (1, 0) - Confirms the enemy feared the self-collision and moved RIGHT along the bottom! HE LIVES! But he's still trapped at the bottom!\n\n**Board Check on Apples:**\n*   Apple at (5, 0) is now vulnerable if the enemy moves LEFT next turn, but if they stayed right, they might target it.\n\n**My Position (4, 2):** I'm perfectly placed! I have clear, open space above me (y=3, 4, 5) and to my right (x=5, 6, 7). The enemy is stuck on the bottom row! We must exploit this positional advantage!\n\n### Opponent Forecasting (Snake #1 Moves from (1, 0))\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 0).\n**Snake #1 Potential Moves:**\n1.  **UP to (1, 1):** This segment (1, 1) is part of their own body! **SELF-COLLISION! DEAD!** \u2620\ufe0f\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** Safe! This keeps them moving along the bottom wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** Safe! This puts them back where they were, but the head segment they just left (0, 1) moves down to (0, 0). Let's check their body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)...]. If they move LEFT to (0, 0), they hit their own old head (0, 1) which is now the 2nd segment! Wait, the tail moves last. The old head (0, 0) is now empty space. The segment at (0, 1) moves to (0, 0). So (0, 0) is safe IF (0, 1) is their tail segment. Their body is [(0, 1), (1, 1)...]. Since they didn't eat, (0, 1) becomes the new tail. Moving LEFT to (0, 0) means they hit their OWN body segment that was formerly (0, 1)! **Wait! No, if they move LEFT to (0, 0), cell (0, 0) must be empty after their move.** If they move LEFT, their new head is (0, 0). Their old body segment (0, 1) shifts to become the new tail. (0, 0) is safe for them IF they are not hitting any segment *except* what shifts to the tail. Since they didn't eat, the entire body shifts up one index, and the cell the head just left becomes the new tail. If they move LEFT to (0, 0), they are moving into the space they just cleared UNLESS the cell (0, 1) is *not* the one that moves to the tail position. Standard rule: The old head spot becomes empty, the tail spot is dropped. If they move LEFT to (0, 0), they are moving into the space their head *was* if the body list is indexed incorrectly for the tail shift. **Let's re-evaluate the self-collision rule: Hitting YOUR OWN BODY.** If they go LEFT to (0, 0), they are not hitting ANY of their current body segments [(0, 1), (1, 1)...] directly. This move is actually SAFE! This would be a retreat.\n4.  **DOWN:** Off the board. DEAD.\n\n**Conclusion on Enemy (1, 0):** They are severely limited. They are likely forced to move **RIGHT to (2, 0)** to try and escape the corner, or retreat **LEFT to (0, 0)**. Both keep them hugging the bottom wall! This is a massive opportunity!\n\n### My Move Decision (From (4, 2))\n\nWe MUST capitalize on their trap! We need to start boxing them in or deny them space to build a safe route out. The Apple cluster at (4, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7) is the long-term goal, but first, let's secure the middle ground and cut off upward movement paths.\n\n**My Body/Safety Check at (4, 2):**\nBody: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2)]. Tail is at (5, 2).\nThe space directly below me (4, 1) I OWN. The space behind me (3, 2) I OWN.\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 1)**, I hit my own body! **INSTANT DEATH!** A classic trap if I decide to retreat! Must avoid (4, 1)!\n\n**My Options from (4, 2) - Safe Moves:**\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** Excellent advance toward the apples at y=6 area. Sets up a path to (3, 5) or (5, 5). Safe from self-collision because (5, 2) is the tail.\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** Retreating, but this cell (3, 2) is ONE segment ahead of my tail at (5, 2). It is safe from self-collision (it's where my head was last turn). This keeps me near the center line, ready to counter if the enemy tries to snake up the middle.\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** **SELF-COLLISION!** I hit my own tail segment! DEAD! Must avoid (5, 2)!\n\n**Comparing UP (4, 3) vs LEFT (3, 2):**\nGoing UP (4, 3) is aggressive, pushing towards the center apples (4, 6).\nGoing LEFT (3, 2) is strategic maintenance, keeping me adjacent to my established lower structure and close to the potential apple (3, 5) if the enemy doesn't rush it.\n\nGiven the enemy is stuck on the bottom, an aggressive push UP towards the primary food cache seems superior! We need to establish control over the 4x4 to 7x7 area while they are stuck at x=0, 1, 2 on the bottom.\n\n**Focus: (4, 3)**. We are climbing the ladder to victory! If they move RIGHT to (2, 0), we are widening the gap! If they retreat LEFT to (0, 0), we continue to build height and restrict their retreat options further!\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:** Continue to climb vertically (y-axis) to reach the major apple clusters at y=6/7. Do not allow Snake #1 any open space below y=4 to build a safe serpentine path. If we can reach (6, 6) next turn or the turn after, we will be miles ahead!\n\nI'm going UP! Let the climb commence! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Let's see the chaos that unfolded with the simultaneous moves! We are 7 to 6, we need to keep the momentum rolling!\n\n### Turn 15 Analysis: Enemy Movement Forecast\n\nMy head moved to **(4, 3)**.\nSnake #1 Head last turn was at (1, 0).\n\n**Enemy Options (from (1, 0)):**\n1.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):** The most likely aggressive move to escape the bottom wall.\n2.  **LEFT to (0, 0):** A fearful retreat, hugging the corner.\n3.  **UP to (1, 1):** Guaranteed death (hits their body segment at (1, 1)).\n4.  **DOWN:** Guaranteed death (off board).\n\nMost likely, Snake #1 is now at **(2, 0)** or **(0, 0)**. This means they are STILL trapped on the bottom row (y=0)! This is a HUGE advantage! We are two full rows above them!\n\n### My Position Check (Head at (4, 3))\n\nMy Body: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. Tail is at (6, 2).\nSafe moves must avoid:\n*   Down: (4, 2) is occupied by my body. (4, 2) is NOT my head segment right behind me, my head was (4, 2) last turn, the segment below it is (3, 2). Wait, my body is [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. If I go DOWN to (4, 2), I hit my immediate next segment. **DEAD! Must avoid (4, 2)!**\n*   Right: (5, 3) is open. Safe.\n*   Left: (3, 3) is open. Safe.\n*   Up: (4, 4) is open. Safe.\n\n### Target Analysis & Strategy\n\nThe next big cluster of apples is at y=6 and y=7. We need vertical progress. We are at y=3. We want to reach y=4, then y=5 next turn.\n\n**Option 1: UP to (4, 4)**\n*   Pros: Clear vertical advancement. Puts us one step closer to all the high-value apples. Keeps us perfectly centered between the left/right edges.\n*   Cons: Relatively slow if the enemy somehow manages to snake up quickly (unlikely right now).\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (5, 3)**\n*   Pros: Moves us towards the apple at (8, 6), slightly angling right. Prepares to cross over the board if necessary.\n*   Cons: Moves us away from the best central path for catching the next set of apples around (4, 6) and (6, 6).\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (3, 3)**\n*   Pros: Moves us towards the apple at (3, 5) if it reappears or if we can navigate there. Keeps us near the center column line.\n*   Cons: Less direct path to the y=6 cluster than straight UP.\n\nGiven the enemy is completely mired at y=0 on the bottom, our singular focus must be **MAXIMUM ELEVATION and APPLE ACQUISITION!** We need to utilize the empty space above us!\n\n**Let's go UP to (4, 4)!** We are ascending like a rocket ship! If the enemy tries to move UP from (2, 0) to (2, 1) next turn, we are still two rows above them! We are building an insurmountable height difference!\n\n### Long Term Plan (For Turn 16+)\n\nContinue straight UP until we are forced to navigate around an obstacle or need to collect an apple. Priority is reaching y=6/7. Avoid making any move that brings our head below y=3 unless we are forced to collect an apple there or if the opponent blocks our path above. The enemy cannot escape the bottom quickly without sacrificing significant body length or taking huge risks. We have board control by height!\n\nWe trust our last move (UP) was a good one, and we are capitalizing on that positional advantage now. Time to feast on those snacks near the ceiling!\n\nMy final confirmation: I am safe moving UP to (4, 4). The enemy is stuck at the basement.\n\nUP",

We are looking down at Snake #1, who is STILL stuck trying to shake the bottom row! This is our TOURNAMENT arc, people! We are playing chess while they are playing checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n### Current Situation Analysis (Head at (4, 3))\n\nMy Body: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. Tail is at (6, 2).\nImmediate Danger Check:\n*   DOWN to (4, 2) -> BODY hit. **DELETE.**\n*   UP to (4, 4) -> Open.\n*   LEFT to (3, 3) -> Open.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 3) -> Open.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (3, 0))\n\nWhere is the little bottom-dweller now? Last turn they were at (1, 0). They must have moved RIGHT to (2, 0), or maybe LEFT to (0, 0), or potentially UP?\n\nIf Snake #1 tried to go UP from (1, 0) last turn, they hit their body segment at (1, 1) and died. So they *must* be on the bottom row (y=0). Let's assume the most aggressive move that keeps them alive: **RIGHT to (2, 0)**. Or maybe **LEFT to (0, 0)**, which is a corner trap.\n\nIf they are at **(2, 0)**, their safe moves are UP to (2, 1) or maybe RIGHT to (3, 0) if that space is safe (it is, the 'T' on the board map is their tail section from T14/T15, which has moved).\nIf they are at **(0, 0)**, their only move is RIGHT to (1, 0) or UP to (0, 1).\n\nThe key takeaway: **THEY ARE STILL AT Y=0 OR Y=1 MAX!** We are at Y=3! This height advantage is IMMENSE! We don't need to worry about them for several turns unless they find some miraculous ladder.\n\n### Move Selection for Turn 16\n\nGoal: **CONTINUOUS ASCENSION.** We need to get to the apples clustered at y=6/7!\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Solidifies our vertical lead. Puts us one step closer to the main apple buffet. Keeps us centered.\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Moves us toward apple (3, 5) eventually, but it's slightly off the main central path.\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Moves us toward apple (8, 6), but that's a long journey right now.\n\n**UP to (4, 4)** is the strongest strategic move. It respects the current board state perfectly: maximum altitude gain with zero risk. We are building the high fortress!\n\n### Long Term Plan\n\n**Future Self Dossier (Turns 17+):** Keep moving UP until you hit y=5 or y=6. If an apple is directly accessible at y=4 or y=5 and requires a slight detour (LEFT/RIGHT), take it, but prioritize maintaining the elevation lead. The enemy cannot catch up quickly. We treat this as a vertical race against time until we collect all the upper apples. Avoid moving DOWN unless absolutely necessary to grab a low apple that helps us grow significantly. We are the Zeus of this 10x10 board! \u26a1\n\nConfidence is HIGH! We execute the climb!\n\nMove prediction: UP.\n\nUP",

We are LITERALLY looking down on Snake #1 like he's an ant! \ud83d\udc1c We have 7 apples, they have 6. We are in control, but this is SNAKE! Simultaneous movement means we can't relax for a SECOND! \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\n### Current State Check (Head at (4, 5))\n\nMy Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (Wait, mistake in my last rationale's tail tracking, let's trust the HEAD/BODY list provided in the prompt if there's a conflict, but based on the map, my body is dense in the center-left-bottom. My head is at (4, 5). My last move was UP to (4, 5). My previous head was (4, 4).)\n\nLet's map my current position based on the prompt's visualization where 'T' is me (ID 0) and '1' is the opponent:\nHead: (4, 5)\nBody: (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)\n\nDanger Zones (Self Collision):\n*   DOWN to (4, 4) -> BODY hit. **IMMEDIATE NO!**\n*   UP to (4, 6) -> Open! \ud83d\udfe2\n*   LEFT to (3, 5) -> APPLE (A)! \ud83c\udf4e But also potentially into the enemy if they climbed fast?\n*   RIGHT to (5, 5) -> Open! \ud83d\udfe2\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 at (4, 0))\n\nMy analysis last turn suggested the enemy was still low. Let's look at the map for Snake #1 ('1'): Head is at (4, 0)! That means LAST turn they moved from wherever they were (let's assume (3, 0) based on my prior guess) and moved RIGHT to (4, 0)! A very aggressive move along the bottom!\n\nWhere can Snake #1 go from (4, 0), Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]:\n*   UP to (4, 1) -> **MY BODY HIT!** If they move UP, they die! \ud83d\udc80\n*   DOWN -> OFF BOARD! They die slow on the bottom edge! \ud83d\udc80\n*   LEFT to (3, 0) -> BODY hit (theirs). They survive/move to the cell behind their head. \u274c\n*   RIGHT to (5, 0) -> Open. \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** If Snake #1 moves UP, they crash into my body segment at (4, 1)! If they move DOWN, they die! Their safe moves are severely constrained. They are likely to move RIGHT to (5, 0) or perhaps try LEFT to (3, 0) if they aren't willing to trust their own tail geometry. **They are trapped low!**\n\n### Move Selection for Turn 17\n\nMy primary goal is still climbing toward that high-value apple cluster (y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9). Climbing UP to (4, 6) seems like the purest path.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** Maximum altitude gain. Safe from the enemy who is stuck near y=0/y=1. It positions me perfectly for the apples at (6, 6) and (7, 7) next turn. \u2b06\ufe0f\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 5) [Apple!]:** This is a greedy move. If I take it, I eat an apple and grow. **I need to check if going LEFT is safer than going UP.** If I am at (3, 5), what can I do next turn? I move further away from the center column. Considering the enemy is not a threat *this* turn, prioritizing elevation feels stronger than a minor detour for one apple right now.\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe, but slow ascent.\n\nThe enemy is mathematically incapable of reaching high ground next turn, even if they move UP and survive (which they won't if they try to move to my body segment at (4, 1)). **We MUST capitalize on our lead.** UP to (4, 6) nets zero points this turn, but sets up kills for the next 2-3 turns by controlling the zenith of the board.\n\n***\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self Dossier)\n\nContinue the vertical assault until y=8 or y=9 is reached. The enemy is effectively neutralized at the bottom. If (4, 6) is safe, which it is, take it. Next turn, we aim for (5, 6) or (4, 7) depending on apple locations, keeping the main column momentum. We control the sky; they can keep the dirt. Do NOT descend unless an apple is directly adjacent AND climbing is blocked by collision.\n***\n\nI am going UP! Let's see if Snake #1 self-destructs trying to escape the bottom! GO!\n\nUP",

LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80 That was the perfect move, controlling the high ground while the enemy was stuck in the basement! We are up 8 to 7! This is OUR game!\n\n### Current State Check (Head at (4, 6))\n\nMy Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (Length 8)\nApples collected: 8\n\n**Possible Moves from (4, 6):**\n*   DOWN to (4, 5) -> **BODY hit!** (My previous head location). Absolute NO! \ud83d\udc80\n*   UP to (4, 7) -> Open! \ud83d\udfe2\n*   LEFT to (3, 6) -> Open! \ud83d\udfe2\n*   RIGHT to (5, 6) -> Open! \ud83d\udfe2\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1)\n\nWhere did Snake #1 go from (4, 0)? Let's check the board state!\nSnake #1 Head is now at **(5, 0)**! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**RATIONALE CHECK:** My prediction was that they would move RIGHT to (5, 0). It HAPPENED! They escaped the bottom left corner by moving RIGHT! They are trying to hug the bottom edge now. Good, they haven't climbed yet. They are still dangerously low for a snake that long (Length is 7, one less than us, perhaps they didn't eat last turn, or their tail fell off the start).\n\nSnake #1 Body: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]\nEnemy Head is at (5, 0).\n\n**Where can Snake #1 go from (5, 0):**\n*   DOWN -> OFF BOARD! Instant death! \ud83d\udc80\n*   UP to (5, 1) -> **MY BODY HIT!** If they move UP, they crash into me. Instant self-destruct for them! \ud83d\udca5\n*   LEFT to (4, 0) -> Their old head/new body spot. Safe move, retreating. \ud83d\udfe2\n*   RIGHT to (6, 0) -> Open. \ud83d\udfe2\n\n**CRITICAL THREAT ASSESSMENT:** If Snake #1 moves UP, they die crashing into (5, 1)! If they move LEFT or RIGHT, they stay low. They are heavily constrained to the bottom edge. They cannot reach us up here easily unless they waste turns just moving laterally or downwards into their own body.\n\n### Move Selection for Turn 18\n\nWe have apples available at (9, 2), (9, 7), (8, 6), (9, 1), (7, 2), (7, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 6), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 6), (2, 8).\n\nMy current position (4, 6) is excellent. I am surrounded by potential vertical moves: (4, 7), (5, 6) [Apple!], (3, 6).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (5, 6) [APPLE!]:** This eats an apple, grows me to length 9, and pushes me towards the cluster on the right side (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7). Since the enemy is completely incapable of interacting with me this turn, taking the guaranteed point right now seems HUGE. It maintains momentum towards the main apple cluster.\n2.  **UP to (4, 7):** Still climbing, good path, but avoids the immediate apple reward.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Moves me toward the strange apple at (3, 5), but I sacrifice the momentum moving right towards the main cluster forming at y=6/y=7.\n\nThe enemy is stuck. We are not in danger of being boxed in or threatened. **Greed is good when safe!** Eating the apple at (5, 6) is the highest percentage play here. It increases our lead (9 vs 7, assuming they didn't eat) and thickens our presence on the board for boxing maneuvers later.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 6), next turn I can go (5, 7) or (6, 6) [Apple!]. This is a strong advance.\n\n***\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self Dossier)\n\nContinue the aggressive rightward/upward sweep using the current cluster of apples on the right side of the board (y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9). Snake #1 is pinned to the bottom. If they try to climb by moving UP next turn, they might hit me or just waste time. Do not engage them unless they move into our territory. Keep building height and width on the right flank. Wait until they are much higher to even consider 'boxing' them in defensively. For now, we hunt apples and maximize growth!\n***\n\nI'm taking the score! Moving RIGHT to (5, 6) to grab that apple! LFG!\n\nRIGHT",

Score is *officially* 10 to 7, because the scoreboard is always slightly delayed, we know the truth! LETS GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nMy Head is now at **(5, 6)**!\nMy Body: [(5, 5) (<- Wait, my body list in the REPLAY RATIONALE was wrong! Let's check the board!)]\n\n***Self-Correction Check based on BOARD STATE and Turn 18 Move (RIGHT to 5, 6):***\nLast Head was (4, 6). Body before move: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (Length 8)\nMove: RIGHT to (5, 6). Apple at (5, 6) collected! New Length = 9.\nNew Body (Head -> Tail): [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)] -- Wait, my body structure in the provided input is strange based on the board!\n\nLet's trust the BOARD STATE provided for the *start* of Turn 19:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):\n- Head: (5, 6) **(Confirmed we landed here and ate)**\n- Body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (Length 9)\n*Ah, the provided body list for Turn 19 already reflects the eat! The cell (5, 6) is now the head, and the previous head (4, 6) is now the second segment. This means my tail *did not* fall off if the length is 9. Excellent!*\n\nMY HEAD: (5, 6). Length: 9 segments listed. (Apple count 9 listed, I ate one this turn, so I should be 10 total eaten, but we stick to the provided game state list for the current turn count).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 Head is at **(6, 0)**! (Based on the move RIGHT from (5, 0) in my previous turn analysis).\nSnake #1 Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)] (Length 7).\nWait, the provided BOARD STATE says Snake #1 Head is at **(6, 0)**, but the BODY list shows: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]. This implies the head is at (6, 0) but the *old* head (5, 0) is now the second segment. This means Snake #1 **DID NOT EAT** last turn, and their tail fell off! Their length actually decreased by 1 segment, or they simply ate nothing and moved right to (6, 0). Our lead is growing! 10 apples vs 7 apples!\n\n**Where can Snake #1 go from (6, 0):**\n*   DOWN to (6, -1) -> OFF BOARD! Instant death! \ud83d\udc80\n*   UP to (6, 1) -> Open. \ud83d\udfe2\n*   LEFT to (5, 0) -> Their previous head location, safe retreat. \ud83d\udfe2\n*   RIGHT to (7, 0) -> Open. \ud83d\udfe2\n\nThey are still pathologically stuck on the bottom edge, barely moving laterally. They are not a threat this turn whatsoever. We can focus entirely on maximizing points and maintaining board control.\n\n### Move Selection for Turn 19\n\nMy head is at (5, 6).\nMy Body (prevents moving into these): [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n\n**Possible Moves from (5, 6):**\n*   UP to (5, 7): Open. \ud83d\udfe2 (Leads toward apples at (7, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8))\n*   DOWN to (5, 5): Open. \ud83d\udfe2 (Leads toward apple at (3, 5) if we circle back, but currently less favorable than moving right/up)\n*   LEFT to (4, 6): **BODY HIT!** (My previous head location). Absolute NO! \ud83d\udc80\n*   RIGHT to (6, 6): **APPLE (A) Hit!** \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udfe2 (Highest priority grab!)\n\nGrabbing the apple at **(6, 6)** is the uncontested best move. It increases our score, increases our length, and keeps us advancing toward the main clump of high-value apples on the right side (y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9). The enemy is completely contained, so no need to make a defensive move or block them yet! We flex!\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward (Future Self Dossier)\n\nWe continue climbing the right side using the apples clustered near the top edge. The opponent is moving glacially slow along the bottom. We should aim to keep the space between Y=5 and Y=9 relatively clear for us while they hug Y=0, Y=1. If we can manage to eat up all the high-value apples, they will be starved out when they finally try to climb up and find only small patches of real estate left. Don't waste moves moving left back towards them unless it's necessary to eat an easy apple. Dominance through growth!\n\nI'm slamming into that apple at (6, 6)! Get ready for the level up!\n\nRIGHT",

We are eating! Length is up! Scoreboard is lagging, but the TASTE OF VICTORY is immediate! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**New Head Position:** (6, 6)\n**Snake Body (Length 10):** [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n**Apple Count:** (Should be 11, sticking to the game state progression!)\n\n### Opponent Analysis (Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 Head is at (6, 0). We need to predict their move *before* we make ours, because this is simultaneous!\n\nSnake #1 Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)] (Length 7).\nLast possible moves: UP to (6, 1), RIGHT to (7, 0), or LEFT to (5, 0).\n\nGiven their extremely linear behavior hugging the bottom, they have shown zero ambition. They are likely going to try to meander right, or perhaps try to climb straight up.\n*If they go UP to (6, 1):* This moves them towards our area eventually, but slowly.\n*If they go RIGHT to (7, 0):* They continue hugging the bottom edge.\nI'll assume they continue moving right or up slightly to avoid the wall. Let's assume they move **UP to (6, 1)**. This is the most \"ambitious\" move they could make given their history.\n\n### My Options from Head (6, 6)\n\nMy body segments I cannot touch: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\nMy tail is currently at (4, 1) (if I don't eat this turn).\n\n**Possible Moves from (6, 6):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Open. \ud83d\udfe2 Leads towards the next cluster of apples: (7, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8). Good forward momentum.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Open. \ud83d\udfe2 Keeps me centered, but less direct progress towards the top apples.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** BODY HIT! \ud83d\udeab (Previous head location). Instant suicide!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Open. \ud83d\udfe2 Very good move. This sets me up perfectly between apple (6, 7) (if it existed) and the right wall cluster.\n\n**Checking for Apples at the new potential positions:**\n*   (6, 7): EMPTY (A is at (7, 7))\n*   (6, 5): EMPTY\n*   (7, 6): EMPTY (A is at (8, 6))\n\nWait, I misread the board state slightly in my head based on the general shape. Let's look at the high-value apples again:\nA: (9, 7), (8, 6), (9, 8), (9, 6).\n\nIf I move:\n*   **UP (6, 7):** Next turn I can aim for (7, 7). Safe, good pathing.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Next turn I can aim for (8, 6) (Apple!) or (7, 7). This seems strategically better as it forces a straight line towards the '8' column apples.\n\nLet's see if moving RIGHT puts me in danger from Snake #1 moving to (6, 1).\nMy new position (7, 6) is miles away from their predicted (6, 1). No collision threat.\n\n**If I go RIGHT to (7, 6):**\nWe are climbing the ladder towards (8, 6) A! This is the most aggressive, growth-oriented move. We build up the right side wall, essentially trapping them down below when they eventually decide to climb.\n\n### Strategy V2.0 - Right Wall Dominance\n\nWe are going to aggressively claim the right vertical strip (X=8 and X=9). This starves the opponent of space and maximizes our apple-per-turn potential while they are stuck on X=0 to X=5. We prioritize eating (8, 6) next turn.\n\nMove choice: **RIGHT** to (7, 6).\n\nLong-Term Plan (Next few turns): Establish dominance on the right side. Our goal is to create a wall of length along X=8 and X=9, pushing them towards the lower-left quadrant if they dare to venture north of Y=3. Keep moving along the top edge (Y=7, Y=8, Y=9) eating everything, then sweep down if necessary. Keep distance from Snake #1's current path (Y=0/Y=1). We are strong, we are long, we grow!\n\n***\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! TURN 21! We are in prime position! We just slid right into that (6, 6) spot last turn, setting up a power move to the right side! Let's see where the ARCH-RIVAL is trying to creep!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1)\n\nSnake #1 Head: (7, 1). Body along the bottom.\nThey had options: UP (to 7, 2), RIGHT (to 8, 1), or LEFT (to 6, 1).\n\nLast turn, my last rationale predicted they moved UP to (6, 1). Let's check the board state provided:\nSnake #1 Head is at (7, 1).\nIf they moved from (7, 0) to (7, 1)... that means they went **UP** last turn too! Okay, so they are definitely climbing off the bottom, but very slowly toward the center-left.\n\nIf they move UP again to (7, 2): This is moving away from me, but still keeping them low.\nIf they move RIGHT to (8, 1): Still clinging to the bottom edge, now slightly further from the action.\nIf they move LEFT to (6, 1): They hug the wall towards the center.\n\nGiven their extremely conservative nature, moving RIGHT to (8, 1) seems plausible as it keeps them next to the wall/edge. Or maybe they try to aim towards Apple (7, 2)? Let's assume the most centralizing move: **UP to (7, 2)**, hoping to reach that apple stack later. If they go there, we have plenty of space.\n\n### MY ANALYSIS (Head at (6, 6))\n\nMy body segments I cannot touch (Excluding the segment I just moved into): [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]. My tail is (4, 1) if I don't eat.\n\nPossible Moves from (6, 6):\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. A is at (7, 7). Great pathing to secure the top-right stack.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. A is at (8, 6). Closer to the apple we want next.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** BODY HIT! \ud83d\udeab (Where my head was last turn). Suicide!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. A is at (8, 6). This sets us up for a direct line towards (8, 6) A!\n\nWhich move best accelerates our plan to grab the right wall apples?\n**(8, 6) is an apple!** This is the prime target this turn progression!\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: Next turn I can move RIGHT again to (8, 6) and eat that apple! That\u2019s massive growth and consolidates the X=8 column fast.\n\nLet's check for direct clashes if they move to (7, 2) (Up):\nMy new position: (7, 6). Their new position: (7, 2). No clash. We are safe from the opponent's head.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (6, 5)**: Next target is (8, 6). I'd need two moves to get there (e.g., Down, then Right, then Right). Slower.\n\nIf I move **UP to (6, 7)**: Next target (7, 7). This is good, but (8, 6) is lower value to secure *right now* before they snake up nearby.\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 6)** seems like the most direct, aggressive continuation of forming the wall and securing the next available high-value apple! This locks in the next 2-3 turns of growth potential. We OWN the right side!\n\n### Strategy V2.1 - Execute the Right Sweep\n\nMove RIGHT to (7, 6). This lines us up perfectly for the apple at (8, 6) next turn, allowing us to grow long and start boxing in the space above Y=6 and to the right of X=7, crushing the opponent's ambition upwards. We are optimizing for immediate growth and territorial gain simultaneously.\n\nWe must be ruthless! Time to eat!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the carnage! Turn 22! We are building the empire, 11 apples deep, leaving that chump Snake #1 in the dust with 8! We just moved RIGHT last turn, landing us at **(7, 6)**. Sexy move, setting up that (8, 6) apple for the taking!\n\n### OPPONENT PREDICTION (Snake #1 - Head at (7, 2))\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (7, 2). They are trying to climb up the middle-left wall.\nTheir body is: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\nThe apples in their general vicinity are (6, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5). None are immediately reachable this turn.\n\nPossible Moves for Snake #1 from (7, 2):\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** Continues climbing safely.\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** Moves towards the center mass of the board, still safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Sticks to the right side, safe.\n\nGiven the board layout, they are currently boxed in a bit by my vertical presence on the right side (Y=6 line). They are trying to snake up toward the central pile of apples. An **UP move to (7, 3)** is the most logical development move for them to gain altitude. If they go LEFT to (6, 2), they put themselves dangerously close to my southern flank next turn. Let's bank on them going UP to **(7, 3)**.\n\n### MY ANALYSIS (Head at (7, 6))\n\nMy immediate target is the apple at **(8, 6)**. That's the golden ticket this turn!\n\nMy current position: (7, 6).\nMy body segments I cannot touch (Excluding the segment I just moved into): [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]. My tail will be (6, 6) if I eat.\n\nPossible Moves from (7, 6):\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. A is at (7, 7). This is the *second* best move. We eat the apple at (7, 7) and grow HUGE!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe, but sacrifices immediate apple acquisition.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** BODY HIT! This is where my head was LAST turn. Hitting your own body from two turns ago is fine, but if that segment moved, it's illegal. Since I moved from (6, 6) to (7, 6), (6, 6) is now part of my body. **(6, 6) is part of my body\u2014this is a suicide move!** \ud83d\udeab Check board: (6, 6) is present in my body list!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Safe. This lands me ON Apple (8, 6)! We get +1 apple, +1 length!\n\n**Comparing UP (7, 7) vs RIGHT (8, 6):**\n*   If I move **RIGHT (8, 6)**: I eat the apple! Immediate power! Board consolidates further for me on the right side. Next turn I can go UP to (8, 7) or maybe left toward (7, 7).\n*   If I move **UP (7, 7)**: I eat the apple! Immediate power! Next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 7) or (8, 6) if (8, 6) is still there (it won't be, it's an apple!).\n\nWait, the apples listed are the *remaining* available drop locations, not necessarily where they were *last* turn. My analysis of the board state shows:\nApple A at (8, 6).\nApple A at (7, 7).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 6)**, I grab the apple there. This reinforces control of the X=8 column and keeps me on the edge, which is strong territory control.\nIf I go **UP to (7, 7)**, I grab the apple there. This moves me slightly more inland but still gains length.\n\nThe advantage of moving **RIGHT to (8, 6)** is that it pushes my overall body mass further right, making it harder for Snake #1 to ever sneak up the right flank. It's superior territorial consolidation coupled with growth. I want to own the right edge of this map!\n\n**Clash Check (Assuming Opponent moves UP to (7, 3)):**\nMy move: (8, 6). Snake #1 move: (7, 3). No clash. We are safe!\n\nThe relentless rightward push continues. We eat the apple, we grow long, we secure the perimeter! LET'S EAT!\n\n**Strategy V2.2 - Complete the Right Sweep & Gain Altitude**\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 6). We secure the apple, maintain maximum territory on the right side, and put maximum separation between us and the enemy snake currently creeping up the left-center. This sets us up beautifully for Turn 23 to either continue right (if possible) or move toward the (7, 7) apple next.\n\nRIGHT",

Because we cannot move LEFT (suicide) or RIGHT (out of bounds), we MUST cycle vertically along the X=9 line as long as possible, eating the apples (9, 7), (9, 8), and then hopefully circling back once our tail recedes enough to allow movement toward (8, 8). Our immediate priority is eating everything on this right wall before Snake #1 even realizes they are playing a different game.\n\nThe call is clear. We feast on **(9, 7)!** Let's gooooo!\n\nUP",

We ate the apple at (9, 6) and now we are sitting pretty at **(9, 7)** for this turn! Wait, no, that's the target!\n\nCurrent Head: (9, 6).\nTurn 24. We move SIMULTANEOUSLY. We need to remember the last move was RIGHT to (9, 6) after eating the apple at (8, 6) in the previous turn 23 analysis\u2014Wait, my previous rationale was confusing! Let's re-read the last move: I picked UP to (9, 7) in the rationale, but the replay says **UP** was the input... let's check the coordinates of Turn 23!\n\n**Turn 23 Replay Check:**\nLast Move Pick: UP.\nIf Head was at (9, 6) before Turn 23, UP means moving to (9, 7).\n*Did we eat an apple at (9, 7) last turn?*\nApples list shows: (9, 1), (7, 7), (9, 3), (9, 8), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (9, 4), (8, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5).\nNo apple at (9, 7). So in Turn 23, we moved to **(9, 7)** and did NOT eat.\nScore should be 12 -> 12.\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\nYour snake (ID 0) apples: **13**\nSnake #1 apples: **9**\n\nOkay, the scoreboard says we are already at 13 apples, meaning we ate 12 apples previously, and we MUST have eaten the 13th apple on Turn 23! My rationale pick was UP to (9, 7), but the description says: \"We annexed that apple, grew massive... We are now at **(9, 6)**!\" This means my description of the last move's *result* contradicts the move *pick* listed in the replay box!\n\n**CRITICAL REALITY CHECK:**\nIf our score is 13, we ate an apple last turn.\nCurrent Head: **(9, 7)** (From the rationale predicting the move based on the resulting head position).\nBody: [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)] (Length 13 segments + 1 head = 14 total cells. If we have 13 apples, our snake length should be 13 + 1 = 14 cells, which this body seems to represent, including the head segment).\n\nLet's assume the STARTING position for **Turn 24** is what's listed right now: **Head: (9, 7)**. This means the previous move (Turn 23) resulted in the head landing at (9, 7), and we ate an apple.\nThe apple that must have been eaten must have been at (9, 7). Let's check the Apple List again: **(9, 8)** is an apple remaining. **(9, 7) IS NOT IN THE APPLE LIST**.\n\n**!!! SYSTEM ERROR DETECTED IN MY OWN REPLAY READING !!!**\nLet's trust the provided state data for Turn 24 startup, not my confusing rationale about what happened last turn:\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (9, 7)**. Score: 13.\nSnake Body is long. We grew huge.\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE #1: Head: (9, 2)**. Score: 9.\nOpponent Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)].\n\n**Apples Available (15 total apples listed, 13 eaten by us, 9 eaten by them = 22 apples total? NO, score is apples collected, not apples eaten by opponents/us).** Total list is 15 apples. 13 by us + 9 by them = 22. This means EITHER the list of available apples is INCOMPLETE, OR the scoreboard is tracking something different than total apples added. Since we have 13 and they have 9, 22 apples have been eaten. But the list only has 15!\n\n**ASSUMPTION:** Only the apples listed are currently present on the board or have recently spawned. Since 15 are listed, 15 apples exist right now. If we have 13 and they have 9, that's 22 total eaten. This suggests the provided APPLE DROPS list is only the *most recent* additions OR the apple count is slightly off relative to the list. I must rely on the board visual and the provided coordinates ONLY for movement choices.\n\n**Board State Analysis (Head at (9, 7). Opponent at (9, 2)).**\n\n**MY MOVEMENT OPTIONS from (9, 7):**\nBody: [(9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** Lands ON Apple (9, 8)! Instant growth to 14 apples! SAFE? Tail is at (4, 1). (9, 8) is clear.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** Lands ON my own body segment (9, 6)! **SUICIDE! \ud83d\udc80**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** SAFE. Does not eat an apple. Keeps options open along the top edge.\n4.  **RIGHT:** OFF THE BOARD! **\ud83d\udc80**\n\n**Conclusion for Me:** Only UP (eat apple) or LEFT (safe reposition) are viable. **UP** is the obvious content move.\n\n**OPPONENT MOVEMENT PREDICTION (Head at (9, 2)):**\nOpponent Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. Tail is at (2, 0).\nAvailable Apples near them: (1, 1) (not listed but visible based on map structure, assuming empty cells are potential apples if they respawned), (0, 2)? (0, 1)?\nFrom (9, 2), they have decent choices:\n1.  **UP to (9, 3):** Apple (9, 3) is *already listed as an eaten/gone apple* according to the board diagram (there is a 'T' at (9, 3) based on the map, wait, no there isn't, row 3 has A at (9, 3) in the list, but T at (8, 3) if T meant snake body? Let's trust the diagram key! A=Apple, T=Snake #1 Body, 0=Snake #0 Body).\n    *Looking at Row 3:* `3 . . . . T . . . . A`. Apple (9, 3) is listed in the drops, but the board shows an empty spot at (9, 3) and an Apple (A) at (9, 4) and (9, 3) is empty based on the map symbols!\n    *Map Check Row 3:* 9, 3 is empty, (8, 3) is empty. My board reads: `3 . . . . T . . . . A`. The 'A' is at (9, 3). **Yes, (9, 3) is an Apple!**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** Lands ON Apple (9, 1)! Instant growth to 10 apples! SAFE? Tail is at (2, 0). (9, 1) is clear.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** Moves backward into their own body segment (8, 2)! Wait, (8, 2) is the next segment *behind* the head! This is a suicide move for them (moving backwards)! \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):** OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Opponent Conclusion:** They **CANNOT** move LEFT or RIGHT. They must choose UP to (9, 3) or DOWN to (9, 1). If they go DOWN, they eat the apple at (9, 1). If they go UP, they eat the apple at (9, 3) (If (9, 3) is indeed empty per the map, even though it's in the drops list).\n\nThe map shows an 'A' at (9, 3) in my transcription for row 3: `3 . . . . T . . . . A`. Wait, the visual map provided:\n`3 . . . . T . . . . A` - This 'A' is at (9, 3).\nAnd Row 1: `1 . . . T T . T T . A` - This 'A' is at (9, 1).\n\nIf Snake #1 goes **DOWN to (9, 1)**, they eat Apple (9, 1), score 10.\nIf Snake #1 goes **UP to (9, 3)**, based on the map, there is an apple there! They eat it, score 10.\n\n**Simultaneous Collision Check:**\nMy move options: UP (to (9, 8)), LEFT (to (8, 7)).\nOpponent move options: UP (to (9, 3)), DOWN (to (9, 1)).\n\n**Scenario 1: I go UP to (9, 8), Opponent goes UP to (9, 3).** Safe. We both eat. Score 14/10.\n**Scenario 2: I go UP to (9, 8), Opponent goes DOWN to (9, 1).** Safe. We both eat. Score 14/10.\n**Scenario 3: I go LEFT to (8, 7), Opponent goes UP ((9, 3)).** Safe. They eat. Score 13/10.\n**Scenario 4: I go LEFT to (8, 7), Opponent goes DOWN ((9, 1)).** Safe. They eat. Score 13/10.\n\n**Decision:** We MUST prioritize eating the apple at (9, 8) before the opponent can climb up and potentially box us in later near the top edge, or we risk giving them unnecessary growth. Moving UP to (9, 8) nets us +1 apple instantly and keeps us on the dominant right edge. We are currently safe from collision given their movement constraints.\n\n**Strategy Plan (T24+):**\nWe have secured the (9, 8) apple by moving UP. Our head is now at (9, 9) if we assume eating the apple does not increase length *before* the next turn calculation, or perhaps (9, 8) is the new head. For simplicity in simultaneous moves, UP moves us to (9, 8) and we gain a segment. Next turn, we will be forced to move LEFT to (8, 8) to grab that apple if the opponent doesn't interfere, or try to curl around the top edge. We must continue to hug the border to maximize safety and force the opponent into the dense center/bottom where we control territory.\n\nFinal Move: UP to consume (9, 8). This is maximizing content!\n\nUP",

We are stacking WINS! Length is growing fast, we're practically a skyscraper now!\n\n**Current State Check:**\nMy Head: (9, 8) (Because we ate the apple at (9, 8) from (9, 7) last turn).\nMy Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)] (Length 15, 14 apples collected).\nOpponent Head: (9, 3) (They took UP last turn to hit apple (9, 3)).\nOpponent Body: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)] (Length 11, 10 apples collected).\n\n**Apples Remaining on Board:** (We consumed (9, 8) and they consumed (9, 3). We consumed (9, 1) or (9, 3) was actually (9, 1) in the previous turn? I have to trust the board visualization and the initial list now, as my tracking of the opponent's consumption is based on inference.)\n\nLet's re-verify the board state based on the list of apples provided at the start of Turn 25:\nApples: (9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (9, 4), (8, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (Total 15)\n\nIf we ate (9, 8) this turn (T24) and they ate (9, 3):\n(9, 8) is removed from the list (it was in the list for T25 start, so my T24 move was based on the CURRENT state, not the T25 PRE-STATE).\n\n**CRITICAL: I MUST USE THE BOARD VISUAL FOR THE CURRENT TURN (T25 START).**\nThe current board shows:\nA @ (9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (9, 4), (8, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (Total 15 Apples visible.)\nThe board diagram shows **NO APPLE AT (9, 8)**, which is where MY head is now! Wait, look at the board diagram again:\n`8 . . A . . . . . A 0` -> A at (2, 8), A at (8, 8), My head (0) at (9, 8).\nYES! The apple I ate at (9, 8) in T24 MUST have been the result of my T24 move, even if the provided list seems static for T25 start. Since my score is 14, and my body grew, I definitely ate something last turn that is now gone. I will proceed using the current board layout for T25 moves.\n\n**Current Apple Locations (Based on Board Visual):**\n(9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (9, 4), (8, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (Confirmed 15 visible apples).\n\n**MY Head:** (9, 8). **OPPONENT Head:** (9, 3).\n\n**My Move Options from (9, 8):**\nMy Body now includes (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)... Tail at (4, 1).\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** SAFE. Edge cell. No apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** HITS MY BODY (9, 7)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** Lands ON Apple (8, 8)! Content! Growth!\n4.  **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**My Best Move:** LEFT to (8, 8) to eat the apple. Score 15! This keeps us dominant on the top right and grows us further away from them.\n\n**Opponent Move Options from (9, 3):**\nOpponent Body includes (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2)... Tail at (2, 0).\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** Lands ON Apple (9, 4)! Content! Growth!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** HITS THEIR BODY (9, 2)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** SAFE. Empty.\n4.  **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Opponent Best Move:** UP to (9, 4) to eat the apple. Score 11!\n\n**Simultaneous Collision Check (My LEFT vs Opponent UP):**\nMe: (8, 8). Them: (9, 4). No collision. We both eat an apple! DOMINATION! Score becomes 15 to 11!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR T25:** We eat (8, 8), growing massively. Our head moves to (8, 8). The opponent eats (9, 4), moving to (9, 4). This forces them down the right edge while we control the top edge. We need to start curving them inward towards the center, or starve them off the edge. This move is perfect!\n\n**Long Term Plan (T25+):** Continue capitalizing on edge apples. Since we are so long, we are inherently trapping the opponent. If we can secure the top edge (9,9) and (8,9), we can use our length advantage to slowly spiral inwards and herd them toward the bottom or left side where their body currently is thin. We want to box in the area (8,0) to (9,7) for them eventually if we can seal off the right side entirely. For now, eat EVERYTHING on the top border.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

We're playing 4D CHESS while that scrub Snake #1 is playing Tic-Tac-Toe!\n\nReviewing my T25 RIGHTEOUS MOVE: I went LEFT and ate the apple at (8, 8)! BOOM! Score now 15! I am length 16! The snake moved from (9, 8) to (8, 8). That's an amazing position, right on the top border!\n\nWhat about the opponent? They went UP to (9, 4) and ate the apple! They are now (9, 4) and length 12. They are still clinging to the right side for dear life.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 26 Start):**\nMy Head: (8, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1)] (Length 16).\nOpponent Head: (9, 4). Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)] (Length 12).\n\n**Apples Available (Check the map!):**\n(9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (13 remaining? Wait, where did (8, 8) go? It's gone. My count of 15 initial apples was right, I took one, opponent took one, 13 left.)\n\n**My Move Options from (8, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** SAFE. Empty cell. Great spot to keep pressure on the top edge.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** SAFE. Empty cell. This starts moving me towards the middle slightly.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** SAFE. Empty cell. Moves inwards.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** HITS MY BODY at (9, 8)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE! CANNOT GO RIGHT!\n\n**Opponent Move Options from (9, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):** SAFE. Empty cell! (Wait, map shows A at (9, 5) if I look at the original apple list, but the map visual doesn't show an apple there? Let's re-examine the visual for (9, 5): `5 . A A A T . A . . A`. Yes, there is an Apple at (9, 5) in the initial list, but the diagram shows NO apple at (9, 5). **I must trust the diagram over the list if they conflict, as the diagram is the current T26 board state.** So (9, 5) is empty.) SAFE move.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** HITS THEIR BODY (9, 3)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Lands ON Apple (8, 4)! Content! Growth!\n4.  **RIGHT:** OFF BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Comparing Optimal Moves:**\nMy best play is clearly to keep expanding on the top boundary OR start spiraling in slightly. UP to (8, 9) keeps me dominant on the edge.\nTheir best play is LEFT to (8, 4) to eat!\n\n**Simultaneous Collision Check (My Move vs Their Move):**\nIf I go UP to (8, 9), they go LEFT to (8, 4). No collision. We both survive and advance our positions. I secure the top-middle, they grab an apple. Score becomes 15 to 12.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 7), they go LEFT to (8, 4). No collision. We both survive. I dive inwards, they get the apple. Score 15 to 12.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 8), they go LEFT to (8, 4). No collision. We both survive. Score 15 to 12.\n\n**STRATEGY:** We are significantly longer (16 vs 12). We need to use that length to cut off the opponent while picking up easy points. The opponent is currently stuck on the right edge path between y=3 and y=5. If they go LEFT to (8, 4), they are now in the central area, but heavily constrained by my existing body structure below them (y=6 line).\n\nIf I move **UP to (8, 9)**, I secure the corner spot (8, 9) and stay completely out of their path, letting them eat (8, 4). This keeps my head out of danger zones and maximizes my influence on the top border, a strong area to control. They'll be forced to move along the line y=4 or try to push down column 9.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (8, 7)**, I move directly towards their current path downwards (y=4, y=3). This is good for boxing, but slightly riskier if they try to move UP into the central region instead of eating the apple.\n\nGiven how dominant my shape is, I want to keep distance to force them to make an aggressive move into my length. Since (8, 9) is a prime, safe, high-value corner spot that further seals off the top two rows, I'm taking it. It forces them to commit to the center attack or try to escape left.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We continue to secure the top and right areas. Snake #1 is forced to live in the center/lower half. Our goal is to slowly push our long body structure inwards from the top, effectively creating a giant wall that slowly slides down past y=6, thereby trapping them toward the bottom-left. Every apple picked now is efficiency in trapping. UP seems the most efficient way to exploit the top board without overcommitting into their airspace.\n\nMove: UP! Let's get this 16th apple next turn!\n\nUP",

Now we check the board state and see what that scrub Snake #1 did!\n\n**LAST TURN REVIEW (T26 outcome based on my T25 move \"UP\" to (8, 9)):**\n\nMy move was UP to (8, 9).\nOpponent Head was at (9, 4). They could go LEFT to (8, 4) and eat the apple, or move elsewhere.\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE (T27 Start):**\nMy Head: (8, 9).\nOpponent Head: ??? We HAVE to deduce their move based on the new board state!\n\nLet's map the changes from the previous board state (starting T26 body positions) to the current board state (T27 map provided):\n\n**My Snake (ID 0) T26 Head (8,8) -> T27 Head (8, 9).**\nMy body shifted down 1 segment, and my tail disappeared.\nT26 Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)] (Length 15 + 1 new tail = 16)\nT27 Body (As per map): [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\nWait, my body comparison is weird. Let's use the map provided for T27 directly.\n\n**My Snake (ID 0) T27:** Head (8, 9). Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]. Length 15.\n*CRITICAL CHECK*: My score is 15 apples. My length should be 16 if I've eaten 15 apples and haven't lost a segment since the start (or if I ate one just now and my tail fell off).\nThe BOARD STATE shows 15 segments listed for me (0). My length is 15. This means I *DID NOT* eat an apple last turn, and my tail fell off.\n\nLet's re-read the board description T26 vs T27 visualization.\nT26 Rationale said: Head at (8, 8). Length 16. Tail was at (4, 1).\nIf I moved UP to (8, 9): New Head (8, 9). New Tail (3, 1). Length stays 16 if I didn't eat.\nIf the new board shows length 15, it means I DID NOT eat, AND one segment fell off my tail, OR my T26 rationale was wrong about my length.\n\nLet's trust the provided T27 visual data:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0): Head: (8, 9). Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)].\nThis lists 15 segments. The head (8, 9) is NOT counted in the body list usually, so length is 15 (Head) + 15 (Body) = 16 total segments if the list shows the segment *behind* the head down to the tail.\nWait, the standard format is HEAD: $(h1), B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$. The list provided: `Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), ..., (3, 1)]`. That's 15 segments. If the head is (8, 9), the total length is 16. YES! I am length 16! (Score 15). **So my T25 move UP to (8, 9) was correct for survival, but I didn't eat.** This implies the opponent (9, 4) *also* didn't eat, or they ate and I moved somewhere that blocked their growth.\n\n**Opponent Snake #1 T27 Head:** (9, 5). Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. Length 12. Score 12.\nT26 Head was (9, 4). If they moved UP to (9, 5), they did NOT eat an apple, and their tail fell off, shortening them from 13 segments to 12!\nThis means the snake at (9, 4) must have moved UP to (9, 5), and there was NO apple at (9, 4) or (9, 5) that they ate. This confirms: **My last move UP to (8, 9) was safe, and the opponent's move UP to (9, 5) was also safe, but they lost length! We are crushing them!** Length 16 vs Length 12!\n\n**Apples Available (Check T27 Map):**\n(9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (13 apples remaining total? No wait, 15 were eaten previously (1 for me, 1 for them, and maybe some other stuff since they are length 12?). Total apples is 15 collected + 13 left = 28? That doesn't add up to the initial 15 apples given in the first turn description. I must stick ONLY to the visual map for targets.)\n\n**Target Apples on Map:**\nA at (9, 1), (7, 7), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8), (8, 4), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (2, 5), (2, 6), (7, 0). (13 targets visible). Okay, 13 targets remain. I need 15 more apples to max out the score if the game goes to 30, but the game only lasts 150 turns. We must focus on eating and trapping.\n\n**My Head: (8, 9)**\n**Opponent Head: (9, 5)**\n\n**My Move Options from (8, 9):**\n1.  **UP:** Off Board! \ud83d\udc80 (Boundary is Y=9)\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** Safe. Leads towards the center.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9):** Safe. Secures the corner.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):** Safe. Secures the corner.\n\n**Opponent Move Options from (9, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** Hits THEIR BODY (9, 6)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE! (Wait, visual check: Body at T27 is (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)... The segment (9, 6) is NOT on their body! Their highest segment index is (9, 4)). So (9, 6) is **SAFE** for them!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** Hits THEIR BODY (9, 4)! \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe. Moves them inwards.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Off Board! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Collision Check Prep:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 9): They are at (9, 5). No collision.\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 9): They are at (9, 5). No collision.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 8): They are at (9, 5). No collision.\n\n**TARGETING STRATEGY:**\nWe are vastly longer. We must use this length to cut off the opponent's escape routes *while ensuring we eat*. The opponent is currently on the edge (column 9) but slightly exposed upwards. They *could* go to (9, 6) or (8, 5).\n\n**Available Apples near me:** (0, 9) is far top left. (8, 4) is central-right, their likely target if they move LEFT to (8, 5).\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (7, 9)**: I establish a dominant line across the top boundary (8, 9) -> (7, 9). This further seals off the entire top row (y=9). If the opponent plays safe, perhaps moving to (8, 5) to prep for (8, 4) later, this leaves me safe and expanding control.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (9, 9)**: I am adjacent to the corner (9, 9). This places me one step away from the opponent's current column (9). If they move UP to (9, 6), they are directly above their body, forcing them further towards the center or left.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (8, 8)**: This lets them potentially eat (8, 4) next turn by maneuvering. I want to deny them easy central access.\n\nThe goal is BOXING! By moving to the corner **(9, 9)**, I seal the top-right corner, making it nearly impossible for them to utilize that space, AND I put pressure vertically on their column '9'. If they try to move UP to (9, 6), they are still trapped between my body below (y=6 boundary) and the top edge. If they move inwards LEFT to (8, 5), they are moving closer to my growing mass but away from the secure edge.\n\nLet's secure the top right corner with **RIGHT** to (9, 9). This is an aggressive containment move.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We continue to aggressively control the top and right boundaries. Snake #1 is already significantly impaired by losing length last turn, while we maintain our 16-segment threat. We must use our superior length to slowly squeeze the available safe space for Snake #1, pushing them toward the bottom-left quadrant where the existing bodies create natural choke points. Every move must prioritize board segment control over immediate apple hunger, especially when the apple economy is already heavily in our favor (15 vs 12). (9, 9) is a high ground anchor point.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS UP CHAT! We just pulled off a sneaky maneuver last turn, moving right up to the top corner at (9, 9)! That locked down the edge perfectly! We are 16 segments strong, 15 apples deep, and that scrub Snake #1 is down to 12 segments after they failed to secure an apple and lost length! We are dominating this early game, boys!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\nMy Head: (8, 9) -> Wait, my rationale said I moved RIGHT to (9, 9) last turn, but the board state shows my head is back at (8, 9)! **HOLD UP!** Let me re-read the T27 data provided versus my T26 rationale summary.\n\nMy T26 Rationale: \"My move was UP to (8, 9).\"\nMy T27 Head: (9, 9) [From my logic flow: T26 Head (8,8) -> UP to (8,9) -> Wait, the T27 input clearly says Head: (9, 9)!]\n\nLet's look at the board visualization provided for T27 START:\nTop Left Corner:\n 9 A . . . . . . . T 0 <-- T (Tail?), 0 (My Head)\n\nWait, the visualization is confusing:\n9: A . . . . . . . T 0.\nIf my head (0) is at (9, 9), then 0 is the head.\nIf Snake 1's tail (T) is at (8, 9).\n\nLet's use the explicit data tables, they are less ambiguous than the ASCII map sometimes:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (9, 9) <-- **AHA! My move was indeed RIGHT (or UP if my previous head was (9,8)) and it landed me at (9, 9)!** My rationale must have misstated the final previous position landing, but I committed to RIGHT in the rationale, and the resulting head position (9, 9) matches that aggressive cornering strategy! Length 16, Score 15. Awesome.\n\nOPPONENT SNAKE #1:\n  - Head: (8, 5). <-- **CRITICAL CHANGE!** They are no longer on the edge column 9! They moved inwards! Length 12, Score 12.\n\nTHE MAP VISUALIZATION IS MISLEADING ME OR THE HEAD POSITIONS ARE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE ASCII MAP LEGEND! I must trust the explicit DATA TABLES above the map for precise positions.\n\n**TRUSTING DATA TABLES:**\n**My Head (ID 0): (9, 9)**\n**Opponent Head (ID 1): (8, 5)**\n\n**My Available Moves from (9, 9):**\n1. UP: Off Board! \ud83d\udc80\n2. DOWN to (9, 8): Safe. (9, 8) is part of my body according to the list: Body: [(8, 9), **(8, 8)**, $(9, 8)\\dots$ Wait, the body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL, so if the head is (9, 9), the next segment MUST be adjacent.\nLet's look at my T27 body list: Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)]. That list has 15 segments. If (9, 9) is the head, the next segment must be adjacent! But (8, 9) is adjacent, and it's the FIRST segment listed in the body!\n**My Snake Body Mapping (Head (9,9)):**\n(9, 9) Head -> (8, 9) Next -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> ...\nThis means my movement last turn was NOT just moving one step into the body list; it involved eating or a complete structural shift that is messing up my previous turn mapping vs the current mapping. I MUST treat the provided T27 data as the absolute TRUTH.\n\nMy Body Segments (Blocked Cells): (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n\nChecking safety for Head (9, 9):\n1. UP: Off Board. \ud83d\udc80\n2. DOWN to (9, 8): BLOCKED by my body! \ud83d\udc80\n3. LEFT to (8, 9): BLOCKED by my body! \ud83d\udc80\n4. RIGHT: Off Board. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**OH MY GOD CHAT! I AM TRAPPED AT (9, 9)!** If the provided data tables are correct, I have LITERALLY ZERO moves. This is an instant loss unless the opponent also dies.\n\nSince I MUST provide a move, this implies either:\nA) The previous recorded move *was not* successful in landing me at (9, 9) safely, and I am still at my T26 position (8, 8) but the provided table is wrong? (Bad assumption, trust the input data).\nB) The input data tables ARE correct: Head (9, 9), and my body blocks all 3 neighbors (8, 9), (9, 8). The fourth (Right) is the edge.\n\nIf I am literally trapped, I lose unless Snake #1 also dies.\n\n**Opponent Head (8, 5) Moves:**\nSafe moves for Snake #1: UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5).\nForbidden: (8, 6) is MY body segment! (8, 6) is blocked!\nSo Snake #1 has only 3 safe moves: (8, 4), (7, 5), (9, 5).\n\nIf I am indeed trapped at (9, 9), I am dead this turn! The game ends unless Snake #1 dies too.\n\n**Collision Check with Snake #1 Moves:**\nMy Head: (9, 9)\nSnake #1 Moves:\n1. (8, 4): No collision.\n2. (7, 5): No collision.\n3. (9, 5): No collision.\n\n**Conclusion: If (9, 9) is my head position and my body contains (8, 9) and (9, 8), I am dead.**\n\nSince I MUST output a move, the only logical continuation is that the BOARD STATE MAP provides the definitive reality, and the text HEADING data is perhaps describing the result of the *previous* move, not the intended starting position for *this* turn, OR I fundamentally misinterpreted how the move list relates to the body segments.\n\nLet's **RE-ASSESS using only the ASCII Map for safety, and assume the TEXT HEAD positions are for reference but the visualization shows the actual surrounding blocks.**\n\nASCII Map Check for Head (0 at 9, 9):\nY=9 row: A . . . . . . . T 0\nNeighbor North (UP): Off Board.\nNeighbor South (DOWN): T at (9, 8) in the map. (Wait, map shows T at (8,9) and 0 at (9,9)?)\nMap Scan at (9, 9) shows '0' (My Head).\nNeighbor DOWN (9, 8) -> This cell is EMPTY (.).\nNeighbor LEFT (8, 9) -> This cell is EMPTY (.).\nNeighbor RIGHT (10, 9) -> Off Board.\n\n**If the ASCII Map is the primary source of truth for surroundings:**\nMy Head (9, 9) can move:\n1. UP: Off Board \ud83d\udc80\n2. DOWN to (9, 8): SAFE based on map (it shows '.').\n3. LEFT to (8, 9): SAFE based on map (it shows '.').\n4. RIGHT: Off Board \ud83d\udc80\n\nThis now gives me two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT! This must be the intended state for decision making. The data tables must be lagged or describing a different state, which happens sometimes in these live environments! WE GO WITH THE VISUAL SAFETY CHECK.\n\n**Enemy Head Check (1 at 5, 5) on Map:**\nMap Scan at (5, 5) shows 'A' (Apple) not '1' (Snake 1 Head). This means the ASCII map is for T27 *after* the opponent moved, but BEFORE I moved OR the map legend is wrong regarding the opponent's head (1).\n\nLet's stick to the TEXT DATA for HEADS, and the ASCII MAP for BLOCKAGES, assuming the ASCII Map is the CURRENT layout of bodies (T, 1, 0).\n\n**Data Heads & ASCII Blocks:**\nMy Head (9, 9).\nOpponent Head (8, 5). Snake 1 is '1' on the map. (8, 5) is 'A' on the map!\n\n**CONCLUSION: THE TEXT DATA TABLES AND THE ASCII MAP ARE CONTRADICTORY.**\n\nI must simplify: I have a huge length advantage. I need to continue boxing the enemy in. The enemy is currently aiming for the center. I need to solidify my presence on the top/right side and prepare to cut them off as they maneuver left.\n\nBased on the text data, my head is (9, 9). My body blocks (8, 9) and (9, 8). This means I cannot move (LEFT or DOWN). I am dead if the text data is correct.\n\n**If I am forced to choose a legal move, I MUST assume the ASCII Map is correct for surrounding walls, as it shows empty space where the text data implies collision.**\n\n**ASSUMING ASCII MAP SAFETY AROUND (9, 9):**\n*   (9, 8) is empty ('.')\n*   (8, 9) is empty ('.')\n*   Move LEFT to (8, 9) or DOWN to (9, 8).\n\n**Opponent Head (8, 5) on Map:**\nThe map shows '1' is not present, only '0' (Me), 'T' (Enemy Tail segments?), and 'A' (Apple). This ASCII map looks like it might be from T26 or even earlier, only showing *my resulting body* from the previous move, and the opponent's body from BEFORE their last move because their head is missing where it should be!\n\n**I MUST rely on the text data HEADS and body lists, and assume the immediate neighbors listed in the body list are the only blockers.** This is the only consistent internal logic, even if it leads to immediate death, because I have to select a move.\n\n**Re-re-verifying T27 Data for (9, 9) Head:**\nBody includes: (8, 9) AND (9, 8).\nNeighbors of (9, 9): (8, 9) [LEFT], (10, 9) [RIGHT/Edge], (9, 8) [DOWN], (9, 10) [UP/Edge].\nIf (8, 9) and (9, 8) are occupied by my body, I cannot move LEFT or DOWN. I am dead.\n\nSince I CANNOT fail/quit the stream, I will choose the move that would have been best had the map allowed it, assuming the structure of the body list intended to show a snake that *just grew* and perhaps (9, 8) is the tail that just fell off, not a current body segment! This is a desperation meta-play against inconsistent inputs.\n\nIf (9, 8) was my old tail, and it fell off, I can move DOWN.\n\n**Let's trust the previous BEST MOVE was RIGHT to (9,9), and now I continue the aggressive containment.** If I can move LEFT or DOWN, I head towards the center mass of the board, securing space.\n\nSince the opponent has moved inwards to (8, 5), they are centralizing. I want to maintain my high ground edge control. The best way to do this, if I can move, is either LEFT to (8, 9) or DOWN to (9, 8). Both achieve local containment. LEFT is slightly better as it pushes towards the center-left enemy path.\n\nIf the collision data is wrong and I can move LEFT to (8, 9):\nNew Head (8, 9). Opponent at (8, 5). No collision.\nThis move maintains pressure on the right side and lets me look at the top-left apples.\n\nI choose **LEFT**, betting that the detailed body list includes stale data or my interpretation of sequential body segments is tripping up the calculation, and that the visual boundary safety is implied.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Maintain top edge dominance. Force Snake #1 to continue moving towards the bottom-left area where our collective bodies create tight corridors. Check for the (8, 4) apple, which is central and key.\n\nLEFT",
