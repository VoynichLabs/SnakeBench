We also need to consider that after taking apple at (5,9) the next apple at (7,9) is within reach in just two more movements to the right. \n\nA more defensive approach is to target the apple at (4,2). This requires six movements down and three to the right. This apple is the farthest from the enemy snake and there seems to be less risk to travel to it, considering both snake and enemy snake's current position.\n\nThe overall strategy here is to take the apples farthest from the enemy snake to reduce potential clashes. The next apple to target would be the one at (0,3) as it's the next farthest from the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."
