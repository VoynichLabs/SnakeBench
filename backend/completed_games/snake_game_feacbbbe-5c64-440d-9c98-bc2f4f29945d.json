Immediate apples: one directly north at (3,7), others distant or near enemy positions.\n\nValid moves analysis:\n- UP: Directly to (3,7), empty and holding an apple. Eating it grows me to length 3 with 2 apples, advancing score. No obstructions or collisions risk on this turn\u2014no snake body there, and enemy movements would need to coincide improbably.

Enemy at (1,5) could potentially converge if both move left-ish, increasing collision risk indirectly (e.g., if they aim for my body later). Opens some space but surrenders the easy apple.\n- RIGHT: To (4,6), empty, also lateral, pivoting isometrically. Could set up toward distant right-side apples like (8,3) or (8,1) later, but bypasses the immediate (3,7) apple, potentially allowing space gains now for enduring freedom.\n\nPriority: Safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is best\u2014it scores immediately, maintains momentum north into open vertical space (grid row 7-9 largely clear), avoids traps, and leaves multiple follow-ups (e.g., continue north or branch east/west). LEFT/RIGHT are viable alternatives but less efficient for apple access right now; LEFT risks tighter spaces near x=1-3, RIGHT spreads out more but wastes the prompt apple opportunity. No apparent head-on or self-collision imminent; enemy likely aiming for left apples, minimizing overlap threats.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns: Ate (3,7), now head at (3,7). From there, next move could be UP to (3,8) for more room or RIGHT to (4,7) to angle toward middle-row apples, depending on enemy movements\u2014avoid LEFT if enemy challenges x=2 axis to prevent congestion. Monitor enemy; if they head toward (0,1)/(4,1), circle right for (8,1); aim to hit 50 apples first, keeping space open.\n\nUP",

Closer to apples, maintains good options at (7,6) (up,down,left,right safe; left to (6,6) is open).

Keeps multiple followup options open (can UP back to (7,6), LEFT to (6,5), RIGHT to (8,5)) and advances toward the highest priority apple without immediate enemy threat (enemy is at x=0, y=2, needing ~6 right moves to reach x=6 and unlikely to contest this soon). No risk of head-on collision, as enemy can't reach x=7 this turn. Eating (7,2) grows me to 4 segments, boosting apple lead potential before enemy can eat bottom-left apples.\n\n- LEFT (6,6): Opens a path leftward for exploration or circling, but diverges from the direct route to (7,2) (requires interstate maneuvers to return, like LEFT then UP/DOWN). Still has solid followup options (UP to (6,7) but note (6,7) is my tail, so vertical options; RIGHT back to (7,6); DOWN to (6,5)). Less efficient for eating the imminent (7,2) and risks being cut off if enemy expands rightward unexpectedly, though current enemy distance makes it low-risk. Suboptimal compared to DOWN for apple progress.\n\n- RIGHT (8,6): Detour to x=8, positioning for (8,3)/(8,1) apples eventually (2 down moves + zigzag to (8,3), ~5 total turns from there), but skips (7,2) en route. Broad followup options (LEFT back; UP to (8,7); DOWN to (8,5)). Potentially costly if enemy eats (7,2) while I detour, though (7,2) is closer. Solid secondary choice if aiming for upper/right control, but DOWN is more immediate per last rationale.\n\nAmong safe moves, DOWN best aligns with prior plan to eat (7,2) first for quick growth, maintains high maneuverability, and avoids unnecessary detours\u2014enemy is distant (x=0) and likely targeting their own bottom-left apples ((0,1)/(4,1)), giving me breathing room.

No threat to me at x=7 this turn; they need many RIGHT moves to reach me, and their body is vertical. If they go RIGHT consistently, they'll emerge near x=4-8 eventually.\n- **Options & Trap Avoidance:** All safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) keep future options open: DOWN progresses toward plentiful apples and space; LEFT explores x=6 with potential for more apples if needed; RIGHT preps for x=8 apples later. Board is open, no tight spaces. DOWN doesn't create traps and directly advances my lead-up plan.\n- **Overall Favor:** DOWN is safest, fastest to (7,2), maximizes options, and lets me reassess enemy after enemy moves (and my growth triggers).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nEat (7,2) this turn via DOWN to (7,3), then DOWN next turn. After growth (now 4 segments), watch enemy: if they RIGHT into y=1 (e.g., toward (4,1) or (8,1)), pivot RIGHT to (8,4) then (8,3) or (8,1) to block/contest while eating more. If enemy stays left or up, loop LEFT via x=6 toward more apples or contest (4,1).

Safe enemy moves: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), RIGHT (4,1 eats apple, likely favoring apples). None collide with my head in safe moves this turn. Enemy will probably RIGHT to (4,1), tying them at 3 apples if I don't eat; if they eat, to 4, I stay at 3 temporarily.\n- **Apple Priorities:** (8,1) is reachable in 2 moves via DOWN now to (8,2), then DOWN to (8,1). Other apples ((7,2), (8,6), (1,9)) are farther/different columns. Prioritize chaining x=8 cluster for growth.\n- **Options & Trap Avoidance:** DOWN keeps vertical in x=8 open with 3+ safe follow-ups (e.g., LEFT to apple (7,2), RIGHT to explore). UP offers mid-options but stalls progress to apples. RIGHT hems against edge, reducing space. DOWN best balances progress and space.\n- **Enemy Watch:** If enemy eats at (4,1), they'll be at 4 apples, pulling ahead; I need to eat (8,1) soon to catch up.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\nExecute DOWN this turn to (8,2), position for quick eat at (8,1) next DOWN. Monitor enemy: if they pivot after (4,1) (e.g., towards (8,6) or left/up), adjust LEFT from (8,2) to contest (7,2) or explore x=7 remains. Stay vertical in x=8 for space; aim to eat (8,1) then maneuver to (8,6) or chase remaining apples, targeting 4-5 apples in next 5-8 turns to surpass enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head at (6,1), body extending left.\n\n### Safe Moves from (7,1):\n- UP: (7,2) \u2192 onto apple, safe, eat immediately (+1 to 5 apples, leading).\n- DOWN: (7,0) \u2192 empty, safe, more space at bottom.\n- LEFT: (6,1) \u2192 enemy head present, risk of head-on collision if enemy doesn't move away.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) \u2192 into own body (first part of tail), death.\n\nBest: UP to eat (7,2).\n\n### Enemy Analysis:\nEnemy head at (6,1); could move RIGHT to (7,1) into my head? No, they are at (6,1), RIGHT would be into me if I stay, but heads moving to same cell kill both. Likely enemy will avoid, e.g., UP to (6,2) towards center/cluster, RIGHT/DOWN for space. But LEFT risky; avoid.\n\n### Apple Priorities:\nEat (7,2) UP now (+1 score). Then pivot towards (4,4) or (8,4)/(8,6). Aim to reach 6+ apples soon.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\nAfter eating (7,2) this turn (head to (7,2), body now [(7,1),(8,1),(8,2),(8,3),(7,3)] + growth at tail? Wait, grow by 1: actually, tail stays, add to head end. New body: head(7,2), (7,1),(8,1),(8,2),(8,3),(7,3). From there, DOWN to (7,1) is own body, UP to (7,3) own body, LEFT to (6,2) empty/safe towards (4,4), RIGHT to (8,2) but (8,2) is body\u2014wait, (8,2) is my body, can't. So RIGHT to (8,2) death. Better: from (7,2), LEFT to (6,2) to chase (4,4) (reach in ~2 turns if clear), score +1 to 6. If enemy blocks, loop back for (8,4): after eat at (7,2), might need to go RIGHT to (8,2) but body there\u2014can't. Revising: from (7,2), perhapsDOWN? (7,1) body. Stuck? No: after eat, body is longer, but original body was up to (8,2),(8,3),(7,3). (7,3) is (7,3), from (7,2) UP to (7,3)? (7,3) is own body, death. From (7,2), RIGHT to (8,2) INTO BODY DEATH. LEFT to (6,2) safe. DOWN to (7,1) own body death. So only LEFT safe from (7,2). Damn, trapped after eat? Wait, but eating here means growing, but still only one safe move. Next turn from (7,2), only LEFT to (6,2). Then from (6,2), options to eat (4,4) by LEFT/DOWN etc. If enemy contests (4,4), post-eat at (7,2) I could... wait, is there another way? Maybe not eat now? But eating is priority. Stick to plan: eat now, then maneuver from tight spot.\n\nUP",
