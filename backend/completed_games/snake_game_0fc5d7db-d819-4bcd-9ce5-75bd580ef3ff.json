The enemy snake is at position (9, 6) with no body.\n\nGiven the current position and the apple locations, the best strategy would be to move towards the closest apple, which is at (0, 5). To get there, I need to move LEFT.\n\nAdditionally, I should avoid the enemy snake at (9, 6) by staying away from the right side of the board.\n\nTherefore, my next move is LEFT.\n\nLEFT"

I don't want to risk running into the enemy snake or the wall, so I'll try to move in a way that gives me some flexibility.\n\nI'll decide to move... RIGHT."
