Enemy at (8,0) cannot go RIGHT or DOWN; its only moves are LEFT to (7,0) or UP to (8,1). If the enemy goes LEFT while I go RIGHT we would swap head positions. The rules only declare a collision when two heads move into the same cell, so swapping is allowed by the given rules, but it keeps me adjacent to a long enemy body and reduces safe escape options. If the enemy instead goes UP, RIGHT is safe but still moves me toward the crowded right side.\n- UP moves me to (7,1). After both snakes move, (7,0) becomes my second segment. If the enemy chooses LEFT into (7,0) at the same time, it would move into my body and die (per rules). If the enemy instead goes UP to (8,1), we both simply move up without immediate conflict. UP therefore is the safer choice: it avoids the risky confrontation/swap on the right, keeps more escape options, and even has the potential to punish a hostile LEFT from the enemy.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to maintain space and avoid getting boxed on the right.\n- From row 1, head toward the cluster of apples up-left (3,5) or upward to reach (5,9), while avoiding the enemy\u2019s long body in the right/top-right area.\n- Keep track of the enemy\u2019s next moves; if it blunders into my body I can secure a big positional advantage.\n\nUP",
