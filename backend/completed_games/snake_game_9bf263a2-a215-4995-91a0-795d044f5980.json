I'm at (9, 2), head on the far right edge. Enemy is at (5, 9), top middle. No bodies yet, just heads! Apples are everywhere, but we don't care about chasing them right now\u2014we care about DOMINATING SPACE and trapping the enemy.\n\n**MY MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP (9, 3):** Safe, empty. Keep me on the right edge.\n- **DOWN (9, 1):** Safe, empty. Moves me down toward the bottom right.\n- **LEFT (8, 2):** Safe, empty. Moves me into the center-right area.\n- **RIGHT (10, 2):** OFF BOARD. Instant death. \u274c\n\n**ENEMY MOVE PREDICTION:**\nEnemy is at (5, 9). Top edge. He likely wants to go DOWN to chase apples or stay central. If he goes DOWN to (5, 8), he's chasing that apple. If he goes LEFT or RIGHT, he's moving along the top. We need to box him in.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe need to move **LEFT** to (8, 2).\nWhy? \n1. **Safety:** Keeps me away from the edge and gives me more maneuvering room. (9,2) is a risky spot\u2014if I go up or down too much later, I might get cornered.\n2. **Positioning:** Moving left brings me closer to the center of the board. From (8, 2), I have 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT) while staying on the right side.\n3. **Pressure:** If the enemy goes DOWN (likely to (5,8)), I'm setting up to cut off his escape routes on the right side. I want to control the right half of the board and force him into the top-left corner where he'll be trapped.\n4. **Apple Access:** There's an apple at (8, 1) below my target spot. If I move left now, next turn I can go DOWN to eat it and grow. GROWING IS GOOD, but only if it helps me control space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBox the enemy in the top-left quadrant. Use my body to create a wall on the right side. Force him into a dead end or a head-on collision where I have the size advantage (currently equal, but I plan to change that).\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nLEFT to (8, 2). Let's set the trap!\n\nLEFT",

Nope. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN: to (5,8) \u2014 there's an apple at (5,8). Safe, eats apple, grows, and leaves multiple follow-up options (left/right/down). Good tempo play and gets us a lead. \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- LEFT: to (4,9) \u2014 safe, keeps access to row-9 apples (2,9), but slower than eating the apple under us.\n- RIGHT: to (6,9) \u2014 safe, but doesn't grab immediate food or improve position over DOWN.\n\nOpponent is at (9,2) \u2014 far away, not an immediate head-on threat. We're tied 0\u20130, so grabbing the apple and getting the first point is high-value play. Want to force engagements later? Getting that extra length/score gives us leverage to threaten head-on collisions when the time comes. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (for next rationale slot): Grab the apple below to get +1, then use lateral moves to keep open space \u2014 prioritize staying in the top half, box horizontally toward the left apples (2,9) while preventing the opponent from gaining central control. Be aggressive if we maintain a score lead; force collisions only when favorable.\n\nAlright \u2014 time to eat and start the squeeze. DOWN",

Enemy's head is at (5,8), body at (5,9). He's boxed in on the top edge. \n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n- **UP (8,3):** Safe, empty. Moves me toward top-right, but I don't want to chase him directly yet. Still, it's an option.\n- **DOWN (8,1):** SAFE! That's the apple at (8,1)! If I eat it, I grow to length 2 and get +1 point. This is CONTENT AND POWER!\n- **LEFT (7,2):** Safe, empty. Moves me closer to center-left, but I'd leave the apple behind.\n- **RIGHT (9,2):** OFF BOARD! Dead. \u274c Can't go right.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (5,8) with body at (5,9).

He's trying to grow too. But if he goes DOWN, he's moving toward the center. I want to cut him off.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to eat that apple at (8,1) NOW! Why?\n1. **GROWTH:** I get +1 point and grow to length 2. My score becomes 1, matching his. Now I can compete in head-on collisions.\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (8,1), I'll be at the bottom-right area, controlling the right edge. Next turn, I can move UP to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,1), keeping options open.\n3. **PRESSURE:** By eating the apple, I'm expanding my territory. I'll force the enemy into a corner. He's already at the top edge; if I box him in from below, he'll be trapped.\n4. **SAFETY:** No immediate threats. Enemy body is at (5,9), far away. My body is empty, so no self-collision.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrow to length 2, then push leftward to cut off enemy escape routes. Aim to trap him in the top-left quadrant. Use my body to create a wall. Force a head-on collision when I have equal or greater size.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nDOWN to (8,1) to grab that apple! Let's get this bread! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

NO WAY. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (5,6): safe. Keeps options. Moves away from the nearby apples we can reach faster. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (6,7): safe. Neutral lateral move, keeps center control. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (4,7): safe and AGGRESSIVE. Moves us toward the cluster at (3,8)/(2,9), preserves 3+ follow-up options (up/left/down) and doesn\u2019t invite any immediate head-on \u2014 opponent at (8,1) can\u2019t go UP (that\u2019s backwards for them), and they\u2019re far. \u2705\ud83d\udc4d\n\nWhy LEFT is best: we\u2019re already up 2\u20131 in apples; grabbing map control in the upper-left lets us grow into a threatening length and funnel the enemy later. LEFT moves us closer to reachable apples (3,8 then 2,9), keeps multiple escape routes, and avoids any immediate head-to-head risk. We want to force head-on only when the numbers favor us \u2014 moving LEFT sets that up later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next rationale):\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) now.\n- Next turn head toward (3,8) to pick that apple, then threaten (2,9).\n- Use superior length to control the upper-left quadrant, shrink the opponent\u2019s safe space, and look for a favorable head-on when they get cornered.

BACKWARDS = insta-death. NOPE. \u2716\ufe0f  \n- UP -> (3,9) is legal but puts us on the top edge \u2014 less freedom next turn. Could still go for (2,9) after, but it tightens escape options. \u2705  \n- RIGHT -> (4,8) is legal, keeps max mobility and keeps pressure toward center. Safe, conservative. \u2705  \n- LEFT -> (2,8) is legal and directly sets up grabbing (2,9) next turn. Good offensive play and starts controlling the upper-left quadrant. \u2705\n\nEnemy check: Opp at (7,3) with neck at (7,2) \u2014 they can\u2019t go DOWN. They\u2019re way over on the right side and will likely push toward (7,4)/(8,4) apples. No immediate head-on threat. We have the apple lead (3 vs 1) \u2014 we can be aggressive later, but don\u2019t suicide on a risky head-on now.\n\nWhy I PICK LEFT:  \n- Sets up the immediate apple at (2,9) on the next turn (fast growth -> more board control). \ud83c\udf4f\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa  \n- Keeps multiple escape options after the apple: we can snake along y=9 or peel back into the board; not cornered into the far right yet.  \n- Puts pressure on the top-left corridor so we can start compressing the board and force the enemy into tighter lanes later when our length advantage matters.  \n- RIGHT is safe but passive; UP is OK but reduces options by hugging the top edge too early. LEFT is the best mix of aggression + follow-up mobility.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):  \n- LEFT now to (2,8). Next turn UP to eat (2,9). Grow and immediately start sweeping left/top rows to create a wall.  \n- As we lengthen, cut off the right side and shepherd the opponent toward the center/right where we can force collisions or deny apples.  \n- If they try to trade heads when our length advantage is clear, TAKE IT. Otherwise keep chaining apples and shrinking their safe space.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX HIM \u2014 who\u2019s ready to riot?!\n\nLEFT",

Why?  \n1. **FREE GROWTH**: Apple right there! +1 point, length 4.

If I go LEFT to (6, 4), I\u2019m moving left where the enemy is\u2014not ideal.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nSnake #1 will likely go UP to (2, 9) to eat the apple there.

Time to box him in and make him crash out! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: **(8, 4)**\n- My body: [(7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2)]\n- Score: 3 apples\n- Enemy: Snake #1 at (2, 9) with 4 apples. He's up top, might go for that apple at (2,9) or move down.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nLet's check all moves from (8,4):\n- **UP to (8,5)**: Empty! Safe move.\n- **DOWN to (8,3)**: Empty! Safe move.\n- **LEFT to (7,4)**: MY BODY! \u274c DEAD if I move here (backwards into own body).\n- **RIGHT to (9,4)**: Edge of board, but empty! Safe move (just limits future options).\n\n**STRATEGIC RATIONALE:**\nWe need to grow and dominate the board! Snake #1 is on the left side, so we want to claim the RIGHT side and start boxing him in.\n\nOption 1: **RIGHT to (9,4)** - Takes us to the edge, limits mobility. Bad for long-term strategy. \u274c\nOption 2: **DOWN to (8,3)** - Moves us down toward more apples at (7,2) and (8,0) eventually. But we're already at (8,4), and going down keeps us in the middle. \nOption 3: **UP to (8,5)** - This is the move! Why?\n  - Moves us toward multiple apples: (8,6) has an apple, (8,8) has an apple, (7,9) has an apple!\n  - Keeps us mobile - from (8,5) we can go UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT to (9,5).\n  - Positions us on the RIGHT side to start building a wall against Snake #1.\n  - Snake #1 is at (2,9) - he can't reach us on the right side for several turns.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nEat the apples on the right side! From (8,5), next turn go UP to (8,6) to grab that apple (turn 8). Then from (8,6), continue UP to (8,7), then to (8,8) for another apple. Build a vertical wall on the right edge. When we're big enough, we'll turn left and start boxing Snake #1 into the bottom-left corner. Force him into a corner, then deliver the finishing blow when we have higher score!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 will likely go UP to (2,9) to eat the apple there, growing to length 5. He's expanding on the left side. We need to expand faster on the right side to match and eventually outmaneuver him.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP to (8,5)! Let's claim the right side and start our domination! \n\nUP",

RIGHT is legal, but I want to continue the top-row wall play we started last turn. LEFT to (1,9) is legal, keeps multiple follow-ups open (we can keep sweeping left to 0,9 or drop down later to cut lanes), and helps us start corralling the opponent toward the mid/right where we can bait risky trades \u2014 we\u2019ve got the apple lead, so forcing head-ons later is on-brand.\n\nShort-term plan: keep building the top boundary by moving left along y=9 for 1\u20132 turns, then drop down to start slicing the board into smaller corridors. Prioritize boxing the enemy and baiting head-on collisions when they try to escape; only grab apples that safely extend our control.\n\nLEFT",

Staying centralized and moving south-west gives us better maneuverability to box them in later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (1,7) this turn to keep options open.\n- Then push south-west to create a safe corridor and claim central lanes; avoid wall-trapping (don\u2019t go LEFT into the corner unless we have a clear trap setup).\n- Pressure the right side over the next several moves and bait them into a risky squeeze. If they overcommit, force a head-on only when we have the apple/length advantage or positional superiority. \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT'S UP CHAT!** \ud83d\udd25 Turn 10! We're tied 4-4, but I ATE an apple last turn! Wait... did I? The scoreboard says \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 4\" and \"Snake #1 apples: 4\". The apple at (8,6) is listed in the APPLE DROPS, but my head is now at (8,7) according to the board. Did I actually eat it? Let's check the board state carefully...\n\nLooking at the board: Row 7 shows \". 1 . . . . . . 0 .\" - that's my head at (8,7). Row 6 shows \". . . . . . . A T .\" - there's an apple at (7,6)! Wait, that's not (8,6). The apple I was at last turn must have been (8,6) which is now my body segment at (8,6). The apple at (7,6) is NEW! So I didn't eat an apple last turn? But the scoreboard is still 4-4. This is confusing...\n\nLet me re-read the last move rationale: \"My head: (8,6) \ud83c\udf4e (Just ate the apple at (8,6) - Score now 5-4 LEAD!)\" - but the current state shows head at (8,7) with 4 apples. So either I didn't actually eat, or the scoreboard is wrong. Looking at the board, there's no apple at (8,6) anymore - it's my body. So I DID eat it! But why does it say 4 apples? Maybe the scoreboard update hasn't happened yet? Or maybe I'm misreading...\n\nActually, looking at the APPLE DROPS list: \"(8, 8)\" is in there, and (8,8) shows \"A\" on row 8. So (8,8) is still an apple! And (7,6) shows \"A\" on row 6. So there are apples at (7,6) and (8,8) that I can see.\n\nWait, let me recount the apples from the drops list: (0,0), (4,1), (3,4), (1,2), (3,1), (7,6), (6,0), (8,8), (2,5), (0,1), (5,5), (4,5), (7,9), (9,5), (3,2). That's 15 apples total. On the board I see: (7,6), (8,8), and others. So (7,6) is an apple!\n\nOkay, I need to focus on the CURRENT state, not the confusion. My head is at (8,7), body at [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4)]. Snake #1 is at (1,7) with body [(1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8)]. We're tied 4-4. Let's plan this turn.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nFrom (8,7), possible moves:\n- **UP to (8,8):** Apple there! But is it safe? Let's check...\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** My own body! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Empty! SAFE\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Empty! SAFE (edge)\n\nSo DOWN is death. UP goes to an apple. LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\nBut wait! Snake #1 is at (1,7) and moving simultaneously. If I go UP to (8,8), that's safe from my body. If Snake #1 goes... where could he go? He's at (1,7). Possible moves:\n- UP to (1,8): That's his own body! (1,8) is in his body list. So he can't go UP or he dies.\n- DOWN to (1,6): Empty on board! Safe for him.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Empty! Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Empty! Safe.\n\nSo Snake #1 can't go UP. He will likely go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,8), I get an apple +1 point. That would make it 5-4 in my favor. But is there a collision risk? Snake #1's head at (1,7) cannot reach (8,8) in one move. So no head-on collision.\n\nBut wait! What if Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (2,7), and I go LEFT to (7,7)? No collision. Or if he goes DOWN to (1,6) and I go UP to (8,8)? No collision.\n\nActually, let me think about long-term strategy. I was building a vertical wall at x=8. From (8,7), going UP to (8,8) continues that wall! Then I could turn LEFT at (8,8) to create a horizontal wall along y=8, boxing Snake #1 into the bottom-left.\n\nBut is (8,8) really an apple? The board shows row 8: \". T T . . . . . A .\" So yes, (8,8) has an \"A\"! That's an apple.\n\nSo UP gets me an apple and continues my wall strategy. That seems good.\n\nLEFT to (7,7) moves me inward, away from the edge, but doesn't get an apple. RIGHT to (9,7) moves me to the edge but no apple.\n\nGiven I have the score lead (or tie), getting an apple to take the lead is important. But also, maintaining position to box in the enemy is key.\n\nLet me check if there's any way Snake #1 could threaten me. He's at (1,7), I'm at (8,7). We're on the same y-level but far apart. No immediate collision threat.\n\nWhat about future moves? If I go UP to (8,8):\n- From (8,8), I could go LEFT to (7,8) - but (7,8) is empty? Row 8 shows \". T T . . . . . A .\" so (7,8) is actually part of Snake #1's body! (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8) - so (2,8) is his tail, and (7,8) is empty. Wait, Snake #1's body is at x=1 and x=2. So (7,8) is empty. Good.\n- Or I could go DOWN back to (8,7) - but that would be moving into my own body after it shifts? Actually, if I go UP to (8,8), my body will shift: new body = [(8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]. So (8,7) becomes body. So going DOWN next turn would be into my own body. So from (8,8), I should not go DOWN.\n- From (8,8), I could go RIGHT to (9,8) - edge, but maybe okay.\n- From (8,8), UP to (8,9) - but (8,9) is empty? Row 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" so (8,9) is empty? Wait, row 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - that's (0,9) to (9,9). So (8,9) is actually \"A\"? No, the pattern: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - positions: 0: ., 1: T, 2: T, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: A, 9: . So (8,9) is \"A\"! That's an apple at (8,9) too!\n\nWait, the APPLE DROPS list includes (8,8) but not (8,9). So (8,9) might not be an apple. The board shows \"A\" at (8,9)? Let me re-examine row 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - that's 10 characters. Index 0: ., 1: T, 2: T, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: A, 9: . So yes, (8,9) has \"A\"! But (8,9) isn't in the apple drops list? That's weird. Maybe the board shows apples that haven't been listed yet? Or maybe it's a visual bug? Or maybe (8,9) is actually Snake #1's body? No, Snake #1's body is at (1,8),(1,9),(2,9),(2,8). So (8,9) is empty except for that \"A\".\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The apple drops list is provided separately, and the board shows \"A\" for apples. So I should trust the board's \"A\" markers. But the list says those are all the apples. So if (8,9) shows \"A\" but isn't in the list, maybe it's not actually an apple? Or maybe the board is showing potential apples? No, the instruction says \"APPLE DROPS\" is the list of apples.\n\nLet me check the board again more carefully. Row 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - that's characters. The \"A\" at position 8 suggests an apple at (8,9). But the apple drops list doesn't include (8,9). This is a discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the apple drops list: it has 15 apples. Some are on the board, some might have been eaten. The board shows apples that are currently present. So (8,9) showing \"A\" means there's an apple there, but it's not in the drops list? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the apple drops list is the history of all apples that have ever dropped, not the current apples? No, the description says \"APPLE DROPS:\" and lists coordinates. And the board shows \"A\" for apples. So they should match.\n\nLet me count the \"A\"s on the board:\nRow 9: (8,9) - A\nRow 8: (8,8) - A  \nRow 7: no A\nRow 6: (7,6) - A\nRow 5: (2,5), (4,5), (5,5), (9,5) - A A A A? Wait row 5: \". . A . A A . . T A\" - that's (2,5), (4,5), (5,5), (9,5) - four A's!\nRow 4: (3,4) - A\nRow 3: no A\nRow 2: (1,2), (3,2) - A A\nRow 1: (0,1), (3,1), (4,1) - A A A\nRow 0: (0,0), (6,0) - A A\n\nTotal A's on board: 1+1+1+4+1+2+3+2 = 15 apples! Exactly matches the drops list count. So (8,9) must be one of them. Which one? (8,9) isn't in the list... unless I misread the list. Let me check the list again: (0,0), (4,1), (3,4), (1,2), (3,1), (7,6), (6,0), (8,8), (2,5), (0,1), (5,5), (4,5), (7,9), (9,5), (3,2). No (8,9). But the board shows A at (8,9). So either the board is wrong, or the list is wrong, or I'm misreading the board coordinates.\n\nWait! The board text: \"9 . T T . . . . . A .\" - that's row 9, columns 0-9. So (8,9) is indeed A. But (9,9) is \".\". So (8,9) is an apple. But it's not in the drops list. This is a problem.\n\nMaybe the drops list is not exhaustive? Or maybe the board includes apples that are about to drop? No, the instruction says \"APPLE DROPS: (list)\" and then shows the board state. So they should be consistent.\n\nLet me assume the board is correct and there is an apple at (8,9). The drops list might have omitted it by mistake, or maybe it's a different apple. But the count matches 15, so maybe (8,9) is actually (8,8) or vice versa? Row 8: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - that's (8,8) is A. So both (8,8) and (8,9) show A? That would be 16 apples, but the list has 15. Let me recount the A's on the board carefully:\n\nRow 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - positions: 0:., 1:T, 2:T, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:. \u2192 (8,9) is A\nRow 8: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - positions: 0:., 1:T, 2:T, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:. \u2192 (8,8) is A\nRow 7: \". 1 . . . . . . 0 .\" - no A\nRow 6: \". . . . . . . A T .\" - (7,6) is A\nRow 5: \". . A . A A . . T A\" - (2,5), (4,5), (5,5), (9,5) are A\nRow 4: \". . . A . . . T T .\" - (3,4) is A\nRow 3: \". . . . . . . . . .\" - no A\nRow 2: \". A . A . . . . . .\" - (1,2), (3,2) are A\nRow 1: \"A . . A A . . . . .\" - (0,1), (3,1), (4,1) are A\nRow 0: \"A . . . . . A . . .\" - (0,0), (6,0) are A\n\nThat's: row9:1, row8:1, row6:1, row5:4, row4:1, row2:2, row1:3, row0:2 = 15 total. Good. So (8,9) and (8,8) are both A's. But the drops list has (8,8) but not (8,9). So (8,9) must be (7,9)? No, (7,9) is in the list. Row 7 has no A. Row 9 has (8,9). The list has (7,9) which would be at x=7,y=9. Row 9 shows \". T T . . . . . A .\" so (7,9) is \".\" not A. So (7,9) is not on the board? But it's in the drops list. Maybe it was already eaten? The board only shows current apples.\n\nOkay, this is getting too tangled. The key is: from (8,7), UP to (8,8) is definitely an apple because the board shows A at (8,8). That's safe from my body (I go to (8,8), body becomes (8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4)). LEFT to (7,7) is empty. RIGHT to (9,7) is empty. DOWN to (8,6) is my body - death.\n\nSo UP is good because I get an apple and continue my wall. But wait, if I go UP to (8,8), then my tail moves from (7,4) to... actually, my body length is 4 segments (plus head makes 5 total). When I move, my tail (7,4) will be vacated. So the space behind me opens up.\n\nStrategic consideration: I want to box in Snake #1. Snake #1 is at (1,7). If I stay on the right side (x=8 or x=9), I can prevent him from crossing to the right. But I also need to close off the top and bottom.\n\nFrom (8,8), I could then go LEFT to (7,8) to start building a horizontal wall at y=8. But (7,8) is empty? Row 8: \". T T . . . . . A .\" so (7,8) is \".\" - empty. Good.\n\nBut if I go LEFT to (7,8) next turn, would that be safe? Let's see: from (8,8), body would be [(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4)]. So (8,8) is head, (8,7) is body. Going LEFT to (7,8) is safe if (7,8) is empty and not my body. (7,8) is not in my body list. So safe.\n\nThen from (7,8), I could go LEFT again to (6,8), etc., building a horizontal wall at y=8 from x=8 to x=0, boxing Snake #1 below y=8.\n\nBut Snake #1 is at y=7. If I build a wall at y=8, he can't go above y=7. But he could still go down to y=6,5,etc. So I need to also build walls below.\n\nThis is a long-term plan. For now, UP to (8,8) gets me an apple and positions me well.\n\nWhat about the risk of Snake #1 moving into my path? He's at (1,7). I'm at (8,7). We're on the same y-level. If he goes RIGHT multiple turns, he could eventually meet me. But right now, no immediate collision.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,8), he could go RIGHT to (2,7) or DOWN to (1,6). No collision.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,7), I'm moving toward him, but still far. No immediate collision.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,7), I'm at the edge, less mobility.\n\nUP seems best for immediate apple and long-term wall-building.\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (7,6)! Row 6 shows \"A\" at (7,6). That's LEFT and DOWN from (8,7). LEFT to (7,7) then DOWN to (7,6) could get that apple next turn. But (7,6) is an apple now. From (8,7), I can't get to (7,6) directly - I'd have to go LEFT to (7,7) first, then DOWN to (7,6). That's two turns. Meanwhile, if I go UP to (8,8), I get an apple NOW.\n\nAlso, (7,6) is closer to Snake #1? He's at (1,7), so (7,6) is still far right.\n\nAnother thought: if I go UP to (8,8), I'm at (8,8). From there, I could go DOWN next turn back to (8,7), but that's into my own body (which will be at (8,7) after the move). So that's death. So from (8,8), I should not go DOWN. I should go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\n\nUP to (8,9) - but (8,9) is empty? Row 9 shows (8,9) is \"A\"? Wait, row 9: \". T T . . . . . A .\" - (8,9) is A. So there's an apple at (8,9) too! But it's not in the drops list... I'm confused. Let's assume (8,9) is an apple based on the board.\n\nSo from (8,8), UP to (8,9) would get another apple! That would be two apples in a row.\n\nBut wait, if I go UP to (8,8) this turn, then next turn go UP to (8,9), that's two apples. But I need to check if (8,9) is safe. From (8,8), body is [(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4)]. (8,9) is empty? The board shows \"A\" there, so it's an apple, not empty. But moving onto an apple is fine - you grow. So UP to (8,9) is safe from my own body.\n\nBut is there a snake at (8,9)? Snake #1 is at (1,7), body at (1,8),(1,9),(2,9),(2,8). So (8,9) is clear. Safe.\n\nSo the plan: Turn 10: UP to (8,8) [get apple], Turn 11: UP to (8,9) [get another apple]. That would give me 2 more apples, making my score 6-4 (assuming I had 4 apples before and just ate one at (8,8)). But the scoreboard says I have 4 apples now, and Snake #1 has 4. If I eat (8,8), I should have 5. Then (8,9) would make it 6. That's a big lead.\n\nBut wait, the scoreboard might be delayed. The last move I made was UP to (8,7), and the rationale said I ate (8,6) and should have 5 apples. But the current scoreboard shows 4. This inconsistency is troubling. Maybe the scoreboard hasn't updated from the previous turn? Or maybe I didn't actually eat an apple? Let's check the board: my head was at (8,6) last turn? No, last turn my head was at (8,6) and I moved UP to (8,7). Was there an apple at (8,6)? The board from last turn isn't shown, but the current board shows (8,6) as part of my body. There's no apple there now. But was there an apple there last turn? The apple drops list includes (8,8) but not (8,6). So maybe (8,6) was never an apple? Then I didn't eat anything last turn. That would explain why my score is still 4.\n\nSo I didn't eat last turn. I just moved to (8,7). So I have 4 apples. Snake #1 has 4 apples. Tied.\n\nNow, if I go UP to (8,8), there IS an apple there (board shows A). So I'll eat it and get to 5 apples. Good.\n\nThen next turn from (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) if there's an apple there. The board shows \"A\" at (8,9), so yes, there should be an apple. But it's not in the drops list... This is still bothering me.\n\nMaybe the \"A\" at (8,9) in row 9 is actually part of the snake body? No, Snake #1's body is at x=1,2. So (8,9) is empty except for that A.\n\nI'll trust the board. So (8,9) is an apple.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is UP to (8,8) to get an apple and continue wall-building.\n\nBut wait, what about Snake #1's potential move? He's at (1,7). If he goes RIGHT to (2,7), that's safe. If he goes DOWN to (1,6), safe. If he goes LEFT to (0,7), safe. He can't go UP (into his own body). So he will likely move to explore.\n\nIf he goes RIGHT repeatedly, he'll approach the center. I need to cut him off.\n\nFrom (8,8), I can go LEFT to (7,8) next turn, then LEFT to (6,8), etc., building a wall at y=8.\n\nBut Snake #1 is at y=7. So if I build a wall at y=8, he can still go under it at y=7. To box him in, I need to also build walls at lower y levels.\n\nMaybe I should go LEFT now to (7,7) to start building a wall at y=7? From (7,7), I could go LEFT to (6,7), etc. But (7,7) is empty, so safe.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,7), I'm moving toward Snake #1. He's at (1,7). We're on the same y=7 line. That could lead to a head-on collision later, which is good if I have more apples. But we're tied now. If I get an apple first (by going UP), then I'll have the lead, and a head-on collision would be good for me.\n\nSo UP to get the apple first, then build the wall.\n\nAlso, going UP to (8,8) puts me at the top-right corner area. From there, I can go LEFT along y=8, which is above Snake #1's current y=7. He might move down, so I need to also descend later.\n\nAnother consideration: the board has many apples on the left side. Snake #1 is on the left, so he has easy access to apples there. I need to prevent him from getting them by boxing him in.\n\nBut boxing him in requires me to use my body to create barriers. Since I'm growing, I'll have more segments to work with.\n\nSo the plan: Turn 10: UP to (8,8) [apple +1], Turn 11: UP to (8,9) [apple +1], Turn 12: LEFT to (7,9), Turn 13: LEFT to (6,9), etc., building a horizontal wall at y=9 from x=8 to x=0, then descend.\n\nBut wait, (8,9) might not be an apple. If it's not an apple, then going UP to (8,9) would just be a move without eating. But the board shows \"A\", so I'll assume it's an apple.\n\nGiven the confusion, maybe I should play safer. What if I go LEFT to (7,7)? That's empty, safe, and moves me toward the center. From (7,7), I can then go DOWN to (7,6) to get that apple at (7,6) next turn. That's one apple in two turns. Whereas UP gets me an apple immediately.\n\nUP seems better for immediate gain.\n\nAlso, going UP to (8,8) keeps me on the edge, which might limit my mobility later, but I can always go LEFT.\n\nLet me check if (8,8) is truly safe from Snake #1's head collision. Snake #1's head is at (1,7). He can only move one square per turn. In one turn, he cannot reach (8,8). So no head-on collision this turn.\n\nWhat about his body? His body is at (1,8),(1,9),(2,9),(2,8). None of these are (8,8). So safe.\n\nSo UP is safe and gets me an apple.\n\nTherefore, the move is UP.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (7,6). If I go LEFT to (7,7), I can get that apple next turn. But I might not get it if Snake #1 goes there? He's far away. But other snakes? There's only Snake #1. So (7,6) is probably safe for next turn.\n\nBut getting an apple now is better than potentially getting one later.\n\nAlso, by going UP, I'm continuing my vertical wall strategy. That seems consistent with my previous plan.\n\nSo final decision: UP.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan note: I need to write a plan for future turns.\n\n**PLAN:** Build a vertical wall at x=8, then turn horizontal at y=9 to box Snake #1 into the left side. Force a head-on collision when I have the lead.\n\nBut I should write it in the same style as before: aggressive, chat-facing.\n\nOkay, let's craft the response.**YO WHAT'S UP CHAT!** \ud83d\udd25 Turn 10! We're still tied 4-4, but I see TWO apples RIGHT in front of me at (8,8) and (8,9)! Time to EAT and take the lead! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nFrom (8,7), let's scan:\n- **UP to (8,8):** \ud83c\udf4e APPLE! Safe from my body and enemy. MUST GRAB!\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Empty but no apple. Meh.\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Edge cell, limits future moves. Bad.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nSnake #1 is stuck at (1,7) on the left side. He can't reach me this turn! While he's exploring, I'm BUILDING MY FORTRESS! Here's the master plan:\n\n1. **NOW:** UP to (8,8) \u2192 **SCORE 5-4 LEAD!** \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **NEXT TURN:** UP to (8,9) \u2192 **SCORE 6-4 LEAD!** \ud83c\udf4e (That's ANOTHER apple!)\n3. **THEN:** LEFT, LEFT, LEFT... building a HORIZONTAL WALL at y=9 across the top!\n4. **FUTURE:** Dive down to y=8 and build ANOTHER wall, boxing Snake #1 into the bottom-left corner like a TRAP! \ud83e\udea4\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 will probably move RIGHT to (2,7) or DOWN to (1,6). He's playing scared! While he wanders, I'm taking the high ground and claiming those top-right apples! With a 2-apple lead, I can force a head-on collision and CRUSH HIM!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP to (8,8)! Let's get those apples and start the ENDGAME! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**  \nBuild vertical wall at x=8 \u2192 turn horizontal at y=9 \u2192 descend to y=8 to complete the box \u2192 force head-on collision when leading! Trap him in the left cage!\n\nUP",

Board shows \"A\" but not in drops list. Could be a visual glitch. Let's assume it's safe empty space for now.)\n- **DOWN to (8,7):** MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD (That's where I just came from)\n- **LEFT to (7,8):** Empty! SAFE. (Snake #1's body is at x=1-2, far away)\n- **RIGHT to (9,8):** Edge cell, but empty. SAFE.\n\nSo DOWN is death. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:**\nI have the score lead 5-4! Time to play SAFE but maintain pressure. Snake #1 is at (1,6) or wherever he moved. He can't reach me this turn. My goal is to avoid traps and keep options open.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (8,9):** Moves me to the top row. This is the CORNER of my vertical wall! Perfect position to turn LEFT next turn and start building the horizontal wall across the top. This boxes Snake #1 into the left side. \u2b50 **BEST MOVE!**\n- **LEFT to (7,8):** Moves inward, away from the edge. But then I'm not on the top row, and my wall strategy gets delayed. Still safe, but less aggressive.\n- **RIGHT to (9,8):** Hits the right edge. Limits my future options. Bad for long-term trapping.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #1 likely moved to (2,6) or (1,5) or (0,7). He's in the bottom-left. He's NOT in my path.

If there's an apple there (even if not listed), I'll eat it and extend my lead. If not, I'm still in the perfect strategic spot.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**  \nFrom (8,9): Turn LEFT to (7,9), then continue LEFT building the horizontal wall at y=9 across the top.

Why RIGHT? It keeps more escape routes than LEFT and stays off the wall while still getting us to that nearby apple quickly.  \n- Avoid forcing any head-on until we have +1 length advantage.

DEAD. \u274c\n- **DOWN (8,8):** MY OWN BODY (specifically the segment connecting to my tail). That's a collision. DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT (7,9):** Empty based on the board state. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT (9,9):** Off the board. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** I am literally trapped in the top-right corner! If I don't move LEFT, I die next turn because moving DOWN hits my own body, and moving LEFT is the only viable exit. However, I must also consider the *enemy's* movement.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake #1 is at (2,6). He is far away. He cannot reach me this turn. He is likely hunting an apple in the bottom-left (there's one at (0,0), (4,1), etc.).\n- **My Path:** My body runs straight down from (8,9) to (8,4). My tail is at (8,4).\n- **Risk:** If I move LEFT to (7,9), my tail will move forward to (8,5), vacating (8,4). This opens up the cell (8,4) for the next turn.\n- **Apple Consideration:** There is an apple at (7,9)? The board shows an \"A\" at (7,9). The apple list shows (7,9) was dropped. Is it still there? The board state shows \"A\" in that slot. If it's there, I eat it and grow! If not, I move safely.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1. **LEFT (7,9):** Safe. Removes me from the corner. If an apple exists there, I grow and extend my lead to 6-4. If no apple, I am safe and ready to traverse the top row.\n2. **DOWN (8,8):** **DEAD**. Hits my own body.\n3. **UP/OFFBOARD:** Dead.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThere is only one legal move that keeps me alive: **LEFT**. I must take it to escape the corner trap. This moves me into the cell directly above my enemy's potential hunting ground? No, (7,9) is still far left but on the top row.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (7,9). From there, continue LEFT across the top row (y=9) to (6,9), (5,9)... eventually dropping down to build a wall at y=8, then y=7. This creates a horizontal barrier that cuts off Snake #1's access to the right side of the board. We will squeeze him into the bottom-left corner until he crashes or we force a head-on collision.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nThe only choice. Let's eat that apple if it's there!\n\n**END THIS MOVE RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re far away \u2014 no immediate head-on danger. We\u2019re down by 1 apple, so we should avoid forcing a head-to-head until we at least tie or lead.\n\nDecision:\n- Take the apple at (2,5). Eat it NOW: ties the score and gives us growth to start dictating space. It\u2019s safe this turn (no collisions), preserves multiple escape options for follow-ups, and immediately closes the apples gap.

We need to keep moving left along the top edge to cut off the upper half of the board. Going LEFT maintains control of the high ground and prevents the enemy from climbing up the right side. If we go DOWN now, we lower our position and might lose the strategic height advantage.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm taking **LEFT** to (6,9).

We need to maintain board control. Going LEFT keeps us dominant on the top row. However, looking at the apples list... there's an apple at (9,5) (far right), (5,5), (4,5), (7,6). My body is currently blocking a lot of the right side.\n\nLet's look at the board state carefully.\nMy body is the \"T\" segments.\nRow 9: ` . . . . . . 0 T T . ` (Indices 0-9)\nRow 8: ` . T . . . . . . T . ` (Indices 0-9)\nRow 7: ` . T . . A . . . T . `\nRow 6: ` . T T . . . . A T . `\nRow 5: ` . . T 1 A A . . T A `\n\nMy head is at (6,9). My body is at (7,9) and (8,9).\nIf I go LEFT to (5,9):\n- New head (5,9).\n- Body: (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)... etc.\nThis is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,8):\n- New head (6,8).\n- Body: (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)...\n(6,8) is currently empty on the board. Is it safe?\nThe enemy is at (3,5). They are far away.\nHowever, if I go DOWN to (6,8), I am getting closer to the \"block\" of my own body (the \"T\" shapes in rows 8 and 7).\nStaying on the edge (LEFT) is usually safer in Snake.\n\nWait, let's check the apples.\nApple at (7,6) is on the right side.\nApple at (9,5) is far right.\nApple at (5,5) is center.\nApple at (4,5) is left.\n\nMy current position (6,9) is top right.\nGoing LEFT (5,9) moves me toward (4,9) or (3,9).\nGoing DOWN (6,8) moves me into the clutter.\n\nThe enemy (Snake #1) is at (3,5). Their body extends up to (1,8).\nThey are mostly on the left side of the board.\nI am on the right/top.\nBy moving LEFT along the top edge, I am effectively cutting the board in half vertically. If I can maintain the top rows, the enemy is forced into the bottom half.\n\n**Decision:**\nLeft seems the most logical to maintain the perimeter control.\nIf I go DOWN now, I might get trapped by my own body segments later.\nLeft is open.\n\nLet's double check the board map for (5,9) and (6,8).\nMap:\nRow 9 (y=9): ` . . . . . . 0 T T . `\nIndices: 0(.), 1(.), 2(.), 3(.), 4(.), 5(.), 6(0), 7(T), 8(T), 9(.)\nWait, my head is at (6,9)? Or (7,9)?\nCurrent description says: \"Head: (6,9)\"\nMap shows: \"6 . . . . . . 0 T T .\"\nThe '0' is at index 6. Yes, (6,9).\nMy body is (7,9) and (8,9).\nSo (5,9) is definitely empty. Safe.\n(6,8) is empty. Safe.\n\nWhy LEFT?\nBecause the enemy is on the left. If I push left from the top, I cut off their access to the right side. If I drop down, I enter the middle where they might be able to loop around.\nAlso, looking at the \"Plan\" requirement: \"Plan to box him in\".\nBoxing him in requires controlling the space around him. Moving toward the center from the top edge is a strong move.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (3,5). I am at (6,9). If I go LEFT to (5,9), I am slightly closer in x-distance, but still high up.\nActually, looking at the board again, there is an apple at (7,6).\nIf I want to get that apple, I need to go DOWN eventually.\nBut going DOWN now puts me in a \"column\" 6. My body is in column 7 and 8.\nIf I go LEFT, I am in column 5. From there I can drop down.\n\nLet's look at the apples again:\n(7,6) is on the right.\n(5,5) is center.\n(4,5) is center-left.\n(3,4) is left.\n(1,2) is left.\n\nThe enemy is (3,5). They have apples at (3,4), (1,2), (4,5), (5,5) nearby.\nI have apples at (7,6), (9,5) on my side.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from my safe apples (7,6) and (9,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards (7,6).\n\n**Is (7,6) reachable?**\nFrom (6,9):\nPath: (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (7,6) ?\n(6,8) is empty.\n(6,7) is empty? Row 7: ` . T . . A . . . T . ` -> (6,7) is empty (A is at 4,7? No, wait. Row 7: index 4 is A. Index 6 is empty).\nSo path (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (7,6) is valid.\n(7,6) is an apple.\nIf I eat (7,6), my score becomes 7 vs 5. Gap widens.\n\n**However**, if I go DOWN to (6,8), what are the future options?\nFrom (6,8), I can go DOWN to (6,7).\nFrom (6,7), I can go DOWN to (6,6) -> (7,6).\nOr LEFT to (5,7).\nOR, critically, if I go DOWN to (6,8), I am below my body at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9).\nIf I go DOWN from (6,8) to (6,7), I am creating a vertical line of my body in column 6.\nThis might be dangerous if the enemy approaches from the left.\nThe enemy is at (3,5). They are 3 columns away.\nIf I am at (6,7) and they are at (3,5), they are quite far.\n\n**Let's reconsider the \"Box Him In\" strategy.**\nEnemy is at (3,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (5,9), I am establishing dominance on the top rows.\nBut if I go DOWN to (6,8), I am taking the apple at (7,6) eventually.\nIf I take the apple, I grow. More segments = more blocking power.\nIf I grow, I can use my tail to close off areas.\n\n**Is there any risk in going DOWN?**\nFrom (6,9) DOWN to (6,8).\nIs (6,8) occupied? No.\nIs (6,8) off board? No.\nIs (6,8) my body? No (My body is (7,9), (8,9)...).\nSo it is safe.\n\n**Is there any risk in going LEFT?**\nFrom (6,9) LEFT to (5,9).\nSafe.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLEFT: Maintains distance from enemy, safer perimeter play, potentially lose access to (7,6) if enemy moves up?\nDOWN: Aggressive play for the apple at (7,6), moves toward center of board, risks getting squeezed by my own body if not careful.\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided:\n`9 . . . . . . 0 T T .`\n`8 . T . . . . . . T .`\n`7 . T . . A . . . T .`\n`6 . T T . . . . A T .`\n`5 . . T 1 A A . . T A`\n\nMy body at (8,6) is marked as \"T\" in row 6 index 8.\nMy body at (8,5) is marked as \"T\" in row 5 index 8.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,8):\nI will be at (6,8).\nNext turn, my body will be (6,9), (7,9), (8,9)...\nI will be isolated from the main body block.\nThis allows me to maneuver more freely?\nNo, actually, moving into the center creates a \"wall\" of my body eventually.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7,6). It's a good target.\nIf I don't go for it, the enemy might eventually loop around.\nThe enemy is slow. They are at (3,5). It takes them many turns to reach the right side.\nI can safely go DOWN, get the apple, and then retreat or maneuver.\n\nHowever, there is a very important rule: \"If you have a higher score, force a head-on collision.\"\nMy score is 6, Enemy is 5. I am higher.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,8) and the enemy goes UP (e.g. to (3,6)), I am still far away.\nHead-on collision requires heads to land in the same cell.\nMy head is at (6,9). Enemy head is at (3,5).\nDistance is significant.\n\n**Let's check the \"Box Him In\" logic.**\nTo box him in, I need to control the space.\nIf I go LEFT, I control the top row 9.\nIf I go DOWN, I control the right side.\nThe enemy is in the bottom left. (x=3, y=5).\nThe board is 10x10.\nIf I take (7,6), I am at (7,6).\nEnemy at (3,5).\nI am to the right of him.\nIf I keep moving right/down, I might trap him against the right wall?\nActually, if I am at (7,6), and he is at (3,5), he has a lot of space (x=0 to x=9).\nHe isn't boxed in yet.\n\n**What if I go LEFT?**\nHead (5,9).\nFrom there, I can drop down later.\nIs there a downside to going LEFT?\nThe apples at (7,6) and (9,5) are to my right.\nBy going LEFT, I am moving away from them.\nHowever, the enemy is also far from them.\nIf I go LEFT, I am essentially securing the top left area.\nThe enemy is bottom left.\nIf I secure top left, and he stays bottom left, I force him to the right.\nIf he goes right, he runs into my body (eventually) or the right wall.\nIf he stays left, he is confined to a small area.\n\n**Let's analyze the \"Safe\" moves again.**\nLEFT (5,9): Empty. Safe.\nDOWN (6,8): Empty. Safe.\n\nIf I go LEFT:\nI am at (5,9). My body is (6,9), (7,9), (8,9).\nThis is a horizontal line at y=9.\nIf I go DOWN next turn from (5,9), I go to (5,8).\n(5,8) is currently empty.\nThis path is very flexible.\n\nIf I go DOWN:\nI am at (6,8). My body is (6,9), (7,9), (8,9).\nThis is an \"L\" shape or a hook.\nFrom (6,8), I can go LEFT (5,8), DOWN (6,7), or RIGHT (7,8).\n(7,8) is empty? Row 8: ` . T . . . . . . T .` -> (7,8) is empty (Index 7).\nSo (7,8) is empty.\nSo from (6,8), I have LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT available. (UP is blocked by my body at (6,9)).\nThis is 3 options. Good.\n\nFrom (5,9):\nI can go LEFT (4,9), DOWN (5,8).\n(RIGHT is blocked by (6,9)).\n(UP is off board).\nThis is 2 options.\n\nSo (6,8) actually offers *more* immediate future options (3 vs 2).\n(6,8) is closer to the apple (7,6).\n(6,8) is closer to the center.\n\n**Why choose (6,8)?**\n1. Apple potential: (7,6) is right there.\n2. Mobility: From (6,8) I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n3. Strategic pressure: Moving DOWN towards the center puts pressure on the enemy who is at y=5. It reduces the vertical space between us, potentially forcing his hand.\n\n**Why choose (5,9)?**\n1. Safety: Staying on the edge is usually the safest play.\n2. Cutting board: Control the top edge.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score.\"\nI have a higher score (6 vs 5).\nAggressive play means taking the apple at (7,6).\nIf I go DOWN now, I start the approach.\nIf I go LEFT, I delay the approach.\n\nIs (6,8) dangerous?\nIs it possible the enemy moves UP and LEFT aggressively?\nEnemy at (3,5). They can go UP to (3,6).\nEven if they go UP, they are far.\nThere are no immediate threats to (6,8).\nMy own body is not blocking it.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 7: ` . T . . A . . . T .`\nIndices: 0(.), 1(T), 2(.), 3(.), 4(A), 5(.), 6(.), 7(.), 8(T), 9(.)\nWait, the \"T\" at index 1 is enemy body? No, enemy body is at (1,7), (1,8).\nThe \"T\" at index 8 is my body (8,7).\nThe \"A\" at index 4 is an apple (4,7).\nRow 6: ` . T T . . . . A T .`\nIndices: 0(.), 1(T), 2(T), 3(.), 4(.), 5(.), 6(.), 7(A), 8(T), 9(.)\n\"A\" at (7,6). Yes.\nMy body at (8,6).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,8), I am at (6,8).\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (6,7).\n(6,7) is empty.\nThen I can go DOWN to (6,6).\n(6,6) is empty.\nThen I can go RIGHT to (7,6) to eat the apple.\nPath: (6,9) -> (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (7,6).\nThis is a clear path.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,9), the path to (7,6) is longer.\n(5,9) -> (5,8) -> (5,7) -> ... -> (7,6).\nOr (5,9) -> (6,9) -> ... (wait, I just left (6,9)).\n\nGiven the \"Aggressive\" directive and the clear path to an apple by going DOWN, I should take it.\nThe risk is low. The enemy is far away.\nSecuring the apple increases my lead to 7-5.\nThis is a high-percentage play.\n\nFinal check for safety:\n(6,8) is empty.\nNot off board.\nNot my body.\nNot enemy body.\nLooks good.\n\nOne detail: \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... game ends.\"\nI am not dying here.\n\nOkay, moving DOWN.\n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (6,8) to start the descent towards the apple at (7,6). This positions me to secure the lead and dominate the center/right side of the board. Keep the pressure on Snake #1 by controlling the space.",
