Apples everywhere, but we're playing for DOMINANCE, not just snacks.\n\nFirst, check all four moves:\n\n- **UP** to (0,2): That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? It's on the board. No bodies there. Enemy is far. UP is safe.\n- **DOWN** to (0,0): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (-1,1): Off the board! \u274c DEATH. Eliminate LEFT.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,1): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all immediately safe.\n\nNow, think about the enemy. He's at (1,5). He could go anywhere. If he goes DOWN to (1,4), he's still far. If he goes LEFT to (0,5), that's closer but still 4 away. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nBut we gotta think LONG-TERM. We want to BOX HIM IN. Right now, we're in the bottom-left corner. If we go UP and eat that apple at (0,2), we grow to length 2. That gives us a body segment behind us, blocking our retreat. But it also starts our DOMINATION of the left wall.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (1,1) moves us toward the center, maybe more options. Going DOWN to (0,0) traps us in the corner\u2014only two exits next turn (UP or RIGHT). That's risky.\n\nUP gives us the apple, a point lead, and from (0,2) we can go RIGHT, UP, or DOWN next turn (three options). That's good flexibility.\n\nAlso, eating early apples puts us ahead in score\u2014if we ever get a head-on collision later when we're longer, WE WIN because we have more apples. That's the aggressive play.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (0,2), we'll have head at (0,2), tail at (0,1). Next turn, we should probably move RIGHT to (1,2) to start cutting off the enemy's space and avoid getting pinned on the left edge. We want to gradually expand our territory toward the enemy while keeping our body as a barrier.\n\nChat, we're going for the early lead and board control! Let's take that apple and start growing! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 is head at (2,5), no body. We have a 1-apple lead! That's HUGE early!\n\nCheck all four moves from (0,2):\n\n- **UP** to (0,3): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (0,1): That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c CRASH INTO OURSELVES. DEATH. Eliminate DOWN.\n- **LEFT** to (-1,2): Off the board! \u274c DEATH. Eliminate LEFT.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,2): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\nNow, think about the ENEMY! He's at (2,5). He has four possible moves: UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5), RIGHT to (3,5). All are safe for him right now.\n\nWe need to think about HEAD-ON COLLISION risk! If we go RIGHT to (1,2) and he goes DOWN to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,5), no collision. If he goes DOWN to (2,4), he's still far. If he goes LEFT to (1,5), that's 3 cells away vertically. No direct overlap.\n\nBut wait... what if he goes LEFT to (1,5) and then next turn he could come down? We need to be AGGRESSIVE! We have a length advantage (2 vs 1). If we get a head-on collision NOW, we win because we have more apples! That's the power move!\n\nCheck: Could we force a head-on this turn? If we go RIGHT to (1,2) and he goes... nowhere near. He's at (2,5), we'd be at (1,2). Not possible this turn.\n\nBut think FUTURE! If we go RIGHT to (1,2), we're moving toward the center, more options next turn. If we go UP to (0,3), we're sticking to the left wall, which could limit us.\n\nAlso, apples! There's an apple at (4,2) and (3,1) nearby. Going RIGHT gets us closer to those. Going UP gets us further from them.\n\nWe want to DOMINATE the board! With our longer body, we can start cutting off his space. From (1,2), next turn we could go UP to (1,3), RIGHT to (2,2), or DOWN to (1,1) (but that's our tail, so it'll be empty next turn since we moved). Actually, our tail at (0,1) will move? Wait, we didn't eat an apple last turn? Last turn we moved UP to (0,2) and ate the apple there! So we GREW. That means our tail stays at (0,1) this turn. So after we move, our body will be at head new position, then (0,2), then (0,1). So (1,1) will be empty next turn if we go RIGHT? Let's track: Current body: head (0,2), body (0,1). If we move RIGHT to (1,2), new head (1,2). Body becomes [(1,2), (0,2), (0,1)]? No, we grew last turn, so length is 2. Actually, we started length 1, ate apple, now length 2. So body is head (0,2) and tail (0,1). If we move without eating, we move head to new cell, tail disappears. So new body would be head (new), then (0,2). Tail (0,1) disappears. So (1,1) is empty next turn.\n\nOkay, so from (1,2) next turn, safe moves likely UP, RIGHT, DOWN (since (1,1) empty, (0,2) is our body, so DOWN is safe). Good options!\n\nIf we go UP to (0,3), next turn safe moves? RIGHT to (1,3), UP to (0,4), LEFT off board, DOWN to (0,2) which is our body (will be our body next turn? Actually if we move UP, new head (0,3), body becomes (0,2). So (0,2) is our body next turn, so DOWN would be suicide). So from (0,3), only UP and RIGHT are safe next turn. That's more limiting!\n\nChat, we want to keep options open! RIGHT gives us more flexibility and moves us toward the enemy and apples. Also, we're longer, so we can be more aggressive. If we can get adjacent to him, maybe force a head-on collision next turn if he moves into us.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move RIGHT to (1,2). Next turn, assess enemy position. If he's close, consider moving to set up a head-on collision since we have the apple lead. Otherwise, continue to expand toward center, maybe grab apple at (4,2) or (3,1). Use our body to slowly cut off his escape routes. We want to box him into a corner!\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 head at (2,4), body at (2,5). We both have 1 apple, so we're tied in length (2 vs 2). Head-on collision now would be a DOUBLE KO! We need an apple lead to force that. So avoid direct head-to-head for now.\n\nCheck all four moves from (1,2):\n\n- **UP** to (1,3): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,1): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (0,2): That's our OWN BODY segment! \u274c CRASH INTO OURSELVES. DEATH. Eliminate LEFT.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,2): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\nNow, think about the ENEMY! He's at (2,4). He has four possible moves: UP to (2,5) \u2014 that's his OWN BODY! \u274c He would die. So he won't choose UP unless he's throwing. DOWN to (2,3): Empty. LEFT to (1,4): Empty. RIGHT to (3,4): Empty. So his likely safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to avoid moving into where his head could go! Let's check head-on collision risk:\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,2) and he goes DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 no collision, we're at (2,2), he's at (2,3). If he goes LEFT to (1,4) \u2014 no collision. If he goes RIGHT to (3,4) \u2014 no collision. Safe.\n\nIf we go UP to (1,3) and he goes DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 no collision. He goes LEFT to (1,4) \u2014 adjacent vertically? No, he's at (1,4), we're at (1,3), not same cell. He goes RIGHT to (3,4) \u2014 fine. Safe.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (1,1) and he goes DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 far. He goes LEFT to (1,4) \u2014 far. He goes RIGHT to (3,4) \u2014 far. Safe.\n\nSo all three moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\nNow, FUTURE OPTIONS! We want to keep our options open and start boxing him in. He's at (2,4), near the top-right area? Actually board shows him at (2,4). There's an apple at (3,5) and (4,2) nearby. We want to dominate the center and cut off his space.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2,2) puts us closer to center, gives us next turn options: UP to (2,3), RIGHT to (3,2), DOWN to (2,1). That's three safe moves likely. Also closer to apple at (4,2).\n\nGoing UP to (1,3) sticks us near left wall, next turn options: UP to (1,4), RIGHT to (2,3), DOWN to (1,2) \u2014 but (1,2) will be empty? Wait, after we move, our body will be head new position, then (1,2). So (1,2) is our body next turn, so DOWN would be suicide. So from (1,3), only UP and RIGHT are safe next turn. That's limiting! \u274c\n\nGoing DOWN to (1,1) next turn options: UP to (1,2) \u2014 our body, so no. RIGHT to (2,1), DOWN to (1,0). That's only two safe moves. Also we go toward bottom edge, less control.\n\nChat, RIGHT gives the most flexibility and advances toward the enemy! Also, if we go RIGHT, we might tempt him to go for apple at (3,5) or (4,2), but we can intercept.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move RIGHT to (2,2). Next turn, assess his move. If he moves toward us, we can dodge or set up a trap. We need an apple lead to force head-on. Maybe grab apple at (4,2) soon. Use our body to slowly cut off his escape toward left wall. We want to push him toward top or right edges and box him in!\n\nRIGHT",

Actually (3,4) is center-left. Apples at (3,5), (4,2), (5,2) nearby. We want to cut off his space and maybe grab an apple to get a length lead.\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,2)**: Puts us closer to apple at (4,2) and (5,2). Next turn from (3,2): UP to (3,3), RIGHT to (4,2), DOWN to (3,1) \u2014 all likely safe (unless enemy moves into them). Three options. Also positions us to move toward enemy from below.\n\n- **UP to (2,3)**: Moves us toward enemy vertically. Next turn from (2,3): UP to (2,4) \u2014 that's enemy's current body, but he'll move, so maybe empty? Risky if he stays. LEFT to (1,3) empty, RIGHT to (3,3) empty. Two safe options likely. But we're closer to head-on risk next turn.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,1)**: Moves us away from enemy, toward bottom. Next turn from (2,1): UP to (2,2) \u2014 will be empty (our old head), LEFT to (1,1) empty, RIGHT to (3,1) empty. Three options. But we're giving up board control.\n\nChat, we need to be AGGRESSIVE! We want to pressure him and get an apple lead. Going RIGHT to (3,2) sets up a potential apple grab at (4,2) next turn, and also stays central. It also keeps distance from his head to avoid accidental collision.\n\nIf we go RIGHT, he might go for apple at (3,5) or (4,4). That's fine \u2014 we can then cut off his escape routes.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move RIGHT to (3,2). Next turn, if apple at (4,2) still there, consider grabbing it to get length 3 vs his 2. With length lead, we can force head-on collisions. Start working to push him toward left wall (x=0) or top wall (y=9). Use our body to block his paths. Watch his possible moves each turn and move to counter.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (4,1): Empty cell, on board. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,2): That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE. Eliminate LEFT.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,2): Empty cell, on board.

If we go UP to (4,3) and he goes DOWN to (4,4) \u2014 no collision. If we go RIGHT to (5,2) and he goes RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 no collision. If we go DOWN to (4,1) \u2014 far away.\n\nBut we need to think AGGRESSIVELY! We're tied in length \u2014 we want to get longer than him to force head-on wins! Apples nearby: (5,2) is one step RIGHT \u2014 ANOTHER APPLE RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udf4e That's HUGE! If we go RIGHT to (5,2), we eat the apple, grow to length 4, score 3 vs his 2!

He's at (4,5) \u2014 he'd need three moves to get there (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN). We can grab it NOW.\n\nAlso, going RIGHT to (5,2) puts us closer to other apples at (6,0) and (9,2)? Not immediate. But it sets up future pressure: from (5,2) we can go UP to (5,3), RIGHT to (6,2), or DOWN to (5,1). Lots of options.\n\nWhat about trapping him? He's at (4,5). If we go RIGHT and eat apple, we're at (5,2). He might move toward top apples like (4,8) or (4,9). We can start cutting off the right side of the board.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Grab that apple at (5,2) NOW to take length lead. Then pressure him from below/right. With length 4 vs his 3, we can start forcing him toward walls \u2014 if he faces us head-on, he dies! Next turn from (5,2), consider moving UP to (5,3) to position between him and the right side, or maybe LEFT to (4,2) to block his descent? But watch his moves \u2014 if he goes for apples on row 9, we can cut him off.\n\nRIGHT",

If we go RIGHT to (6,2) and he goes RIGHT to (5,6) \u2014 no collision. If we go DOWN to (5,1) \u2014 far away.\n\nBut we have LENGTH ADVANTAGE now! We should be AGGRESSIVE \u2014 try to force him into a corner or into a head-on! Where is he likely to go? He might go for the apple at (4,7) UP or (5,6) RIGHT. If he goes UP to (4,7), he'll be at (4,7) next turn. If he goes RIGHT to (5,6), he'll be at (5,6).\n\nWe want to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE and pressure him. From our position (5,2), going UP to (5,3) puts us closer to the center and maybe blocks his path down later. Going RIGHT to (6,2) moves us toward the right side apples and could eventually box him from the right.\n\nBut also, we need to think about FUTURE SAFETY \u2014 we're longer now, so we need space to maneuver without trapping ourselves.\n\nCheck apples nearby: (6,0) is two steps DOWN+RIGHT from (5,2). (9,2) is far right. (4,8) and (4,9) are up top.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Use our length advantage to pressure him toward a wall. Next turn, if we go UP to (5,3), we can then go RIGHT to (6,3) or LEFT to (4,3) to start cutting off his movement. If he goes for (4,7) apple, he'll be moving up \u2014 we can try to get above him and force him into the top wall.\n\nActually, RIGHT might be better short-term: go to (6,2), then next turn we can go UP to (6,3) to position between him and the right side apples, limiting his options. Also, from (6,2) we have DOWN to (6,1) toward the (6,0) apple.\n\nBut UP to (5,3) keeps us more central and flexible.\n\nCHAT, WHAT DO YOU THINK? \ud83e\udd14 We're up by 1 apple \u2014 we can afford to be bold!\n\nI'm leaning UP to (5,3) to maintain central pressure and keep options open to go LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn. It also avoids moving too close to the right wall too early.\n\nRIGHT",

From (6,2), going UP to (6,3) moves us toward the center. Going RIGHT to (7,2) moves us toward the right-side apples. Going DOWN to (6,1) moves us toward the (6,0) apple.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We need to get above him or beside him to limit his space. If he goes UP to (4,8), his head will be at (4,8). We could aim to get to (5,8) or (6,8) to block his rightward escape and force him toward the top wall.\n\nBut we also need to eat apples to regain length advantage! Look at apples: (6,0) is close if we go DOWN. (9,2) is far right. (4,9) and (2,9) are top.\n\nI think we go UP to (6,3) \u2014 that positions us to potentially go UP again to (6,4) and then head toward the top to challenge him. It keeps us central and flexible. Going DOWN for (6,0) apple gives us length but takes us away from the action.\n\nCHAT, WHAT'S THE MOVE? \ud83e\udd14 We gotta stay aggressive and contest that top area! I'm feeling UP to pressure him!\n\nUP",

From there we could go UP to (5,5) next turn to block.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,4): Moves us away from him, toward right-side apples (8,5, 9,7) but gives him more space. Seems passive.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! He's longer, but he's trapped against the top wall. We can try to **surround him** by getting above or to his sides. If we go LEFT to (5,4), next turn we could go UP to (5,5) \u2014 that's a key blocking square! If he's at (5,9), his path down is through (5,8), (5,7), etc. If we occupy (5,5), we're building a wall.\n\nAlso, apples: (5,6) is nearby if we go UP then maybe RIGHT later. (4,3) is below if we go LEFT then DOWN. But CHAT, FOCUS ON THE ENEMY! We need to pressure him while he's against the wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (5,4), we aim to go UP to (5,5) to block his downward escape on column 5. If he goes LEFT to (3,9) instead, we adjust. We must avoid letting him slip down and get more space. If we can force him to stay on the top row, he'll eventually run out of moves and crash! We need to eat apples to catch up in length so we can risk a head-on later.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're going **LEFT** to (5,4) to position for the critical block at (5,5)!

He's LONGER!)\n\n**Step 1: Check immediate death moves from (5,4):**\n- **UP** to (5,5): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (5,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,4): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,4): That's our OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE (our neck at (6,4)). Eliminate RIGHT.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Predict enemy moves from (5,9):**\nHis body: [(4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] (length 7)\n- UP to (5,10): OFF THE BOARD! \u274c Death.\n- DOWN to (5,8): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,9): His OWN BODY! \u274c Death.\n- RIGHT to (6,9): Empty.\n\nHis only safe moves: DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9). He'll likely go DOWN to get away from the top wall and toward more space/apples.\n\n**Step 3: Head-on collision risk THIS TURN?**\nIf we go UP to (5,5) and he goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 No collision.\nIf we go DOWN to (5,3) and he goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 No collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (4,4) and he goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 No collision.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 also no collision with any of our moves.\nSo NO DIRECT head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\n**Step 4: Aggressive boxing plan!**\nHe's trying to escape down from the top! We must cut him off! Look at the board: His body blocks column 4 from y=5 to y=9. If he goes DOWN to (5,8), he's still trapped on the right side by his own body? Actually, from (5,8) he could go LEFT to (4,8) (body), RIGHT to (6,8) (open), or DOWN to (5,7) (open).\n\nOur position (5,4) is key! If we go **UP to (5,5)**, we directly block his potential downward path on column 5! He'd have to go around through column 6 or 3. That's PRESSURE! If we go **LEFT to (4,4)**, we're moving toward his tail area but not directly blocking. If we go **DOWN to (5,3)**, we're moving away from him, giving him space \u2014 BAD!\n\nApples nearby: (4,3) is below-left, (5,6) is above-right. But CHAT, FOCUS ON THE ENEMY! We need to trap him while he's long but constrained!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (5,5), we aim to hold that line! If he goes DOWN to (5,8), we're blocking column 5 at y=5. Next turn we could go UP to (5,6) to eat the apple and grow, or go LEFT/RIGHT to further cut off his escape. We must NOT let him slip down past us! If he goes RIGHT to (6,9), we might need to shift right next turn. But occupying (5,5) is AGGRESSIVE and limits his options!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're going **UP** to (5,5) to block his descent and apply maximum pressure! This is the play to box him in! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

This puts MASSIVE pressure! He can't go left into his body, and if we hold that column, he can only move right or down into a shrinking space.\n\nIf we go **UP to (5,6)**, we eat the apple at (5,6) and grow to length 5! But that moves us AWAY from cutting him off. He could then slide down column 5 behind us. Risky!\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (6,5)**, we move away from him, giving him MORE space. BAD!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** OCCUPY COLUMN 4! From (4,5), next turn we can go UP to (4,6) (which is currently his body, but he'll move!) to further block, or go LEFT/DOWN to control more space. We want to squeeze him against the right wall and his own body! He's longer, so we must trap him, not fight him directly.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're going **LEFT** to (4,5) to slam the door on his escape! This is the AGGRESSIVE BOXING MOVE!

But he moved! He was at (5,8) and is now at (5,7), so he moved **DOWN**. His body is now: [(5,8), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (4,7), (4,6)].\nFrom (5,7):\n- UP to (5,8): His OWN BODY! \u274c Death.\n- DOWN to (5,6): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,7): His OWN BODY! \u274c Death.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Empty.\n\nHis only safe moves: **DOWN to (5,6)** or **RIGHT to (6,7)**. He's STILL TRAPPED by his own body wall on the left! CHAT, OUR LAST MOVE TO (4,5) IS PAYING OFF! We're BLOCKING his potential escape down column 4! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**STEP 3: HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go DOWN to (4,4) and he goes DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 No collision.\nIf we go LEFT to (3,5) and he goes DOWN to (5,6) \u2192 No collision.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (6,7) \u2192 also no direct collision with either of our moves.\nSo NO DIRECT head-on risk. Good.\n\n**STEP 4: AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN CONTINUED!**\nWe're at (4,5). Our goal is to squeeze him! He's in column 5, we're in column 4. If we go **LEFT to (3,5)**, we move AWAY from him, giving him more room to breathe. BAD! If we go **DOWN to (4,4)**, we stay in column 4, blocking his leftward escape, AND we position ourselves to maybe swing around and cut off his downward movement next turn.\n\nLook at the board: He's likely going to go DOWN to (5,6) (toward the apple at (5,6)?) or RIGHT to (6,7). If he goes DOWN, he's at (5,6). Next turn, from (4,4) we could go UP to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,4) to continue pressure. If he goes RIGHT to (6,7), he's moving away, but we still control column 4.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** HOLD COLUMN 4! From (4,4), we maintain our wall. We can potentially go UP next turn to (4,5) (which will be empty after we move) to re-block, or go RIGHT to (5,4) to threaten his space. We want to force him against the right wall (x=9) or into a dead end. He's longer, so we must be patient and constrict!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're going **DOWN** to (4,4) to maintain our defensive wall in column 4 and keep future options open! This keeps us alive and continues the squeeze! CHAT, THE BOX IS CLOSING! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Growing to length 5 gets us closer to his length. He has 6 apples, we'd have 4. Still behind, but closing the gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to grow while keeping him constrained. He's longer, so we can't let him roam free. After eating the apple at (4,3), our body will be longer, and we can use that to block more. Next turn from (4,3), safe moves likely DOWN to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,3) or RIGHT to (5,3) (if tail moves). We can start working toward the center again.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Going **DOWN** to (4,3) gets us an apple, grows our snake, and maintains a central position.

Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,3): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** are safe. UP is instant death.\n\n**STEP 2: PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (6,6):**\nFrom (6,6):\n- UP to (6,7): That's HIS OWN BODY! \u274c Death.\n- DOWN to (6,5): Empty.\n- LEFT to (5,6): Apple at (5,6)! He might go for it? But (5,6) is empty now.\n- RIGHT to (7,6): Empty.\n\nHis safe moves: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.** Apple at (5,6) is a strong lure LEFT. If he goes LEFT, he eats and grows to length 8. We need to be careful\u2014if he grows, he gets even longer advantage.\n\n**STEP 3: HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nWe need to check where his head could end up vs. our move.\n\nIf we go **DOWN** to (4,2):\n- He goes DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 No collision.\n- He goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2192 No collision.\n- He goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 No collision.\nSafe.\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (3,3):\n- He goes DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 No.\n- He goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2192 No.\n- He goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 No.\nSafe.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT** to (5,3):\n- He goes DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 No.\n- He goes LEFT to (5,6) \u2192 **WAIT!** If he goes LEFT to (5,6) and we go RIGHT to (5,3), we're not colliding (different cells). But check: Could he go further? No, one move only.\n- He goes RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 No.\nSafe.\n\nSo NO direct head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\n**STEP 4: AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN \u2014 WE NEED TO CUT HIM OFF!**\nHe's at (6,6). The board shows his body creating a wall along column 4-5 top right. We're at (4,3). If we move RIGHT to (5,3), we're moving closer to him horizontally but also closer to the center. If we move LEFT to (3,3), we're moving away and giving him space. If we move DOWN to (4,2), we're moving down, maybe toward apples at (3,1) or (1,0).\n\nBut think long-term: He's longer (7 vs our 5). We cannot afford to let him roam and eat more apples. We need to position ourselves to block his escape routes and force him into a corner.\n\nLook at his possible paths: He's near the right edge. If we move RIGHT to (5,3), we're directly below the apple at (5,6) he might go for. We could then move up next turn to (5,4) or (5,5) to block his descent? But our own tail is at (5,4) and (5,5) currently\u2014those will move as we move? Wait, our body: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). If we move RIGHT to (5,3), our tail (5,4) will move? Actually, on growth, the tail stays until we move without eating. We just ate an apple last turn, so our tail stays put this turn. So moving to (5,3) does not free up (5,4) yet.\n\n**FUTURE PLANNING:** We want to create a vertical wall around column 4-5 to trap him on the right side. Moving DOWN to (4,2) keeps us in column 4, good for wall. Moving RIGHT to (5,3) shifts us to column 5, which is also part of his body wall. Moving LEFT abandons the pressure.\n\nAlso, apples: (3,1) is close if we go DOWN then LEFT. (1,0) is far. (5,6) is near him. We need to grow, but safely.\n\n**BEST MOVE?** I think **RIGHT** to (5,3) is aggressive\u2014puts us closer to him, sets up a potential upward move next turn to threaten his space. It also avoids moving into the lower left where we might get trapped later. DOWN to (4,2) is safe but maybe too passive. LEFT to (3,3) is retreating.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE THE HUNTER! WE GO RIGHT AND START CLAMPING FROM BELOW! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (5,3), safe moves likely UP (to 5,4 but that's our tail next turn? Wait, tail will move after this move since we didn't eat? Actually, we last ate on turn 13, so turn 14 we move without eating (unless we eat now). We are NOT on an apple at (4,3)? No apple there now. So moving to (5,3) is not eating. So our tail (5,4) will move forward? Let's track: Our body: head at (4,3) moving to (5,3). New body: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Tail (5,4) is GONE! So (5,4) becomes empty. So next turn from (5,3), UP to (5,4) would be safe (empty). Good. So we can move up next turn to continue pressure.\n\nRIGHT",

STILL BEHIND, BUT WE'RE HUNTING!  \n\n---\n\n**STEP 1: CHECK IMMEDIATE DEATH MOVES FROM (5,3):**  \n- **UP** to (5,4): Empty (our old tail moved from (5,4) last turn). Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (5,2): Empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (4,3): That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c (second segment). DEATH.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6,3): Empty. Safe.  \n\nSo **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** are safe.

HE'S TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude31 He has no other legal moves unless he wants to suicide. That means we KNOW where he's going next: (4,6).  \n\n---\n\n**STEP 3: HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**  \nWe move simultaneously. If we go:  \n- **UP** to (5,4): He goes LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 No collision.  \n- **DOWN** to (5,2): He goes LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 No collision.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6,3): He goes LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 No collision.  \n\nNo direct head-on risk. BUT we must think ONE TURN AHEAD!  \n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: AGGRESSIVE BOXING PLAN \u2014 HE'S FORCED LEFT!**  \nNext turn, he'll be at (4,6). From there:  \n- UP to (4,7): That's his own body (from (4,8)? Wait, his body: (4,9), (4,8) are behind him. Actually, his body after moving: head to (4,6), then old head (5,6) becomes neck, then (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9). So (4,7) is empty! But (4,8) is his body, so UP to (4,7) is safe.  \n- DOWN to (4,5): That's OUR BODY? Our body: (4,5) is our third segment. If we move this turn, our body shifts. Let's track:  \n\nWe need to simulate our move to see where (4,5) ends up next turn.  \n\nIf we move **UP** to (5,4):  \nOur new body: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (4,5) is still our tail. So (4,5) is occupied by us next turn.  \n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (5,2):  \nOur new body: head (5,2), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (4,5) still ours.  \n\nIf we move **RIGHT** to (6,3):  \nOur new body: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (4,5) still ours.  \n\nSo NO MATTER WHAT, (4,5) is our tail next turn. That means if he goes DOWN from (4,6) to (4,5), he DIES. So his safe moves from (4,6) next turn: UP to (4,7), LEFT to (3,6), RIGHT to (5,6) (but (5,6) will be his old head? Actually after he moves, (5,6) becomes his neck, so RIGHT to (5,6) is his own body \u2014 DEATH). So next turn from (4,6), his safe moves: UP (4,7) and LEFT (3,6).  \n\nWE CAN TRAP HIM! If we position ourselves to block (3,6) or (4,7), we can force him into a corner.  \n\n---\n\n**STEP 5: CHOOSE OUR MOVE TO SET UP THE KILL BOX!**  \nWe want to be in a spot next turn to block his escape.  \n\nOption A: **UP to (5,4)**  \nNext turn from (5,4), we could go LEFT to (4,4) to block his potential DOWN? But he can't go DOWN anyway (our tail at (4,5)). Or we could go UP to (5,5) to pressure from below? Actually (5,5) is empty next turn (our old tail moves). Hmm.  \n\nOption B: **DOWN to (5,2)**  \nThis moves us away from him. Not aggressive. Lets him breathe. BAD.  \n\nOption C: **RIGHT to (6,3)**  \nThis moves us right, away from his position (4,6). Not directly pressuring.  \n\nBut think: We want to be able to move to (4,4) or (3,4) next turn to block his LEFT escape to (3,6). From (5,4), we can go LEFT to (4,4) next turn. From (4,4), we threaten (3,4) and (4,5) is our tail, so he can't go there.  \n\nActually, if we go **UP to (5,4)** now, next turn from (5,4):  \n- LEFT to (4,4) \u2192 safe, and puts us between him and the left side.  \n- UP to (5,5) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (6,4) \u2192 safe.  \n\nThat gives us flexibility to block.  \n\nIf he's at (4,6) next turn, and we're at (4,4), he can't go DOWN (our tail at (4,5)), can't go RIGHT (his body), can only go UP (4,7) or LEFT (3,6). If we then go to (3,4) or (3,5) later, we cut off LEFT.  \n\nYES! UP sets up the squeeze!  \n\n---\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nWe go UP to (5,4) now. Next turn, move LEFT to (4,4) to block his leftward escape from (4,6). Force him UP toward the top wall, where his own body is coiled. He'll have fewer and fewer moves until he crashes!  \n\nWe ignore apples for now \u2014 this is a TRAP play! He's longer, but we can outmaneuver him. If we force him into a dead end, he dies and we win!  \n\nCHAT, WE'RE SETTING THE SNARE! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nUP",

HE'S LONGER, BUT WE'RE SMARTER!\n\n---\n\n**STEP 1: CHECK IMMEDIATE DEATH MOVES FROM (5,4):**\n- **UP** to (5,5): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (5,3): That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c (second segment). DEATH.\n- **LEFT** to (4,4): That's OUR OWN BODY! \u274c (third segment). DEATH.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,4): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo **UP** and **RIGHT** are safe. DOWN and LEFT are instant death.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 2: PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (4,6):**\nFrom (4,6):\n- UP to (4,7): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,5): That's OUR TAIL! \u274c He would die.\n- LEFT to (3,6): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,6): That's HIS OWN BODY (neck after move). \u274c Death.\n\nHis safe moves: **UP to (4,7)** and **LEFT to (3,6)**. He has two escapes!\n\n---\n\n**STEP 3: HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nWe move simultaneously.\nIf we go **UP** to (5,5): He could go UP to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,6). No collision.\nIf we go **RIGHT** to (6,4): He could go UP or LEFT. No collision.\nNo direct head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: EXECUTE THE TRAP PLAN FROM LAST TURN!**\nLast turn we said: Go UP to (5,4), then next turn move LEFT to (4,4) to block his left escape. WE'RE AT (5,4) NOW! The plan is LIVE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nFrom (5,4), our goal is to get to (4,4) to block his LEFT path (to (3,6)). But we can't go LEFT this turn\u2014it's our body! So we must go **UP** or **RIGHT** first, then LEFT next turn? Wait, that delays the block!\n\nActually, if we go **UP** to (5,5) now, next turn from (5,5):\n- LEFT to (4,5) is our tail? Let's simulate: Our tail is at (4,5). If we move UP, our tail stays at (4,5) (we don't grow). So next turn, (4,5) is still our tail. So LEFT from (5,5) to (4,5) is safe (tail moves after we move into it? NO! Moving into your own tail is safe ONLY if the tail moves that same turn. Since we aren't eating an apple, our tail moves forward. So (4,5) becomes empty next turn before we move? Wait, game mechanics: On turn 17, all snakes move simultaneously. Our tail at (4,5) will move to (4,4) because our head moves to (5,5) this turn? Let's track:\n\nCurrent body: H(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), T(4,5).\nWe move UP to (5,5). New body: H(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). Tail (4,5) disappears. So (4,5) becomes empty this turn after our move. So next turn, (4,5) is empty! So from (5,5) next turn, LEFT to (4,5) is safe and empty.\n\nBut our goal is to block his LEFT escape to (3,6). Being at (4,4) or (3,4) is better. If we go UP now to (5,5), next turn we can go LEFT to (4,5) or DOWN to (5,4) (which is our neck, so no). Not ideal for blocking.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT** to (6,4) now, next turn from (6,4) we can go LEFT to (5,4) (safe), but that's not blocking him either.\n\nHOLD UP \u2014 THE PLAN NEEDS ADJUSTMENT! We wanted to be at (4,4) to block, but we can't get there directly because it's our body now. It will be empty next turn (since tail moves). So next turn, (4,4) is free! So we can aim to move to (4,4) next turn from wherever we are.\n\nBut we need to be in a position to move to (4,4) next turn. From (5,5), we can go DOWN to (5,4) or LEFT to (4,5), not to (4,4). From (6,4), we can go LEFT to (5,4) or DOWN to (6,3), not to (4,4). OH NO! We can't reach (4,4) next turn from either UP or RIGHT this turn! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWe need to go **RIGHT** to (6,4) this turn, then next turn go LEFT to (5,4), then turn after go LEFT to (4,4). That's too slow! He'll escape left by then!\n\n---\n\n**STEP 5: NEW AGGRESSIVE PLAY \u2014 CUT HIM OFF DIRECTLY!**\nHe's at (4,6). His escapes: UP (4,7) and LEFT (3,6). We can't block both immediately. But we can threaten a head-on collision if we have equal or greater length? We have shorter length (5 vs 7), so head-on kills us. AVOID.\n\nBut what if we go **UP** to (5,5) and then next turn go UP again to (5,6)? That's his old neck, but after he moves, (5,6) is his body. So going to (5,6) next turn would be suicide. Not good.\n\nWhat about going **RIGHT** to (6,4) and then UP to (6,5) to pressure from the right? Not directly blocking.\n\nCHAT, I'M THINKING... We need to force him toward the top wall where his own body is. If we go **UP** to (5,5), we're below him. That might encourage him to go LEFT to (3,6) away from us. We want him to go UP into the top-left corner where he can be trapped.\n\nActually, let's check his possible moves after he moves:\nIf he goes UP to (4,7), then from (4,7) his safe moves: UP (4,8) is his body? His body: after moving, his body is (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9). So (4,8) is empty! So he can go UP again. He can keep going up along column 4 until (4,9) which is his tail? Actually (4,9) is his tail end. He can go to (4,9) safely if his tail moves? Wait, his tail is at (4,9) currently. If he moves UP to (4,7), his tail stays at (4,9) (no apple). So (4,9) remains occupied. So from (4,7), UP to (4,8) is safe, but UP again to (4,9) is death. So he can go up to (4,8) and then be stuck!\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (3,6), he has more open space.\n\nSo we want to discourage LEFT. How? By being near (3,6) or threatening it. We can't this turn, but we can next turn if we go **RIGHT** now to (6,4), then next turn go LEFT to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4) to threaten (3,4). That's two turns to threaten.\n\nGoing **UP** now to (5,5) doesn't threaten his left escape.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 6: DECISION \u2014 PRESSURE FROM BELOW OR RIGHT?**\nWe have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n- **UP (5,5)**: Puts us closer to him vertically, but doesn't cut off left. He might feel pressured and go left anyway.\n- **RIGHT (6,4)**: Moves us away, but sets up a future flank.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! He's longer, but we can outmaneuver. Let's go **UP** to stay close and pressure him upward toward the top wall trap! If he goes left, we'll chase. If he goes up, we follow and keep him boxed against his own body!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We go UP now to (5,5). Next turn, from (5,5), we go LEFT to (4,5) (which will be empty) to start cutting off his left escape. Then we push him toward the top-left corner! Ignore apples, this is a HUNT! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nCHAT, WE'RE CLAMPING DOWN! HE THINKS HE'S SAFE WITH TWO ESCAPES, BUT WE'RE BUILDING THE WALLS AROUND HIM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

No collision.\nNo direct head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: LONG-TERM PLAN \u2014 CONTINUE THE BOX!**\nHe's longer (9 vs 5), so we CANNOT afford a head-on collision.

Going LEFT (3,5) gets us closer to those, maybe we can grow and close the length gap! Going DOWN (4,4) also moves toward apples but less directly.\n\n**TRAP CONTINUES:** If we go LEFT to (3,5), he likely goes UP or RIGHT. Next turn, we can go UP to (3,6) if he vacates it, or LEFT to (2,5) to further control. We're building a wall below him!\n\n---\n\n**STEP 5: DECISION \u2014 AGGRESSIVE LEFT!**\nWe stay on the offensive! LEFT to (3,5) pressures him, limits his movement, and sets up the final squeeze toward the top-right corner where his tail is coiled! We're shorter, but we're using positioning like a PRO!

Our body list shows 5 segments after head. So we're length 6 total? Let's count: Head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3) \u2192 that's 6 segments. Yes, length 6. Apples: 5. That matches.\n\n**ENEMY HEAD:** (1,7)\n**ENEMY BODY:** [(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)] \u2192 Length 9.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 1: CHECK OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (2,5):**\n- **UP** to (2,6): Empty.

Safe.\n- LEFT to (0,7): That's an APPLE! And empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): That's HIS OWN BODY (neck). \u274c Death.\n\nHis safe moves: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.

No collision.\nIf we go **DOWN to (2,4)**: Same. No collision.\nIf we go **LEFT to (1,5)**: He could go UP/DOWN/LEFT. No collision.\nNo direct head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: LONG-TERM PLAN \u2014 BOX HIM IN!**\nHe's at (1,7). We want to limit his space. Look at the board: His tail is at (5,7)? Wait, his body ends at (5,7) (last in list). Actually his tail is (5,7)? Let's check: His body list: [(2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7)] \u2192 yes, tail at (5,7). So he's coiled near top-left.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (1,5)**, we eat the apple, grow to length 7, and position ourselves to threaten (1,6) or (0,5) next turn. That puts us BELOW him, cutting off his downward escape routes toward the bottom apples.\n\nIf we go **UP to (2,6)**, we get closer to him horizontally, but he's at (1,7) \u2014 we'd be at (2,6), adjacent diagonally. Next turn we could go to (1,6) or (2,7) (but (2,7) is his body). This is more direct pressure but riskier if he moves down into us next turn? Not this turn though.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (2,4)**, we're running away, giving him space. WEAK!\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:** We need to close the length gap! He has 8 apples, we have 5. Eating the apple at (1,5) gets us to 6 apples, length 7. That's crucial! Plus, eating denies him that apple if he ever comes down.\n\n**TRAP VISION:** From (1,5) next turn, we can go UP to (1,6) \u2014 that would block his DOWN move from wherever he is. If he's at (1,7) now and moves UP to (1,8), we can still pursue. If he moves LEFT to (0,7), he's near the wall. We can keep squeezing!\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING 4D SNAKE! EAT AND APPLY PRESSURE! \ud83c\udf4e\u265f\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n**STEP 5: DECISION \u2014 AGGRESSIVE LEFT FOR THE APPLE AND POSITION!**\nLEFT to (1,5) is the MOVE! We grow, we cut off his south, we stay on the offensive! The length gap shrinks, and we're one step closer to forcing a head-on when we're longer! LET'S FEAST AND SQUEEZE! \ud83d\udea8\n\nLEFT",

CHAT, THIS IS OUR CHANCE! \ud83d\udea8\n\n---\n\n**STEP 3: HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**  \nWe move simultaneously.  \nIf we go **UP to (1,6)**: He could go UP (0,8) or DOWN (0,6). No collision.  \nIf we go **DOWN to (1,4)**: Same. No collision.  \nIf we go **LEFT to (0,5)**: He could go UP/DOWN. No collision.  \nNo direct head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 4: LONG-TERM PLAN \u2014 BOX HIM IN COMPLETELY!**  \nHe's pinned on the left wall! If we move **UP to (1,6)**, we block his potential DOWN escape next turn? Actually, from (0,7), if he goes DOWN to (0,6), next turn he could go RIGHT to (1,6) \u2014 but if we're at (1,6) now, next turn we'll move, so he could still move into our old spot. Hmm.\n\nBETTER: Move **LEFT to (0,5)**. This puts us directly below him on the left edge. Next turn, we can go UP to (0,6) \u2014 blocking his DOWN path entirely! If he goes DOWN to (0,6) this turn, we'd collide head-on? Wait, we're moving LEFT to (0,5), he's moving DOWN to (0,6) \u2014 different cells, no collision. But next turn, if we're at (0,5) and he's at (0,6), we can go UP to (0,6) for a head-on? BUT we have length 7 vs his 9 \u2014 we'd lose that head-on! So avoid that.\n\nActually, we want to force a head-on only when we're LONGER. So we need to grow more! Apple at (0,7) is gone (he ate it last turn). Nearest apple is at (1,9) or (2,9) top-left? Too far. Apple at (3,1) bottom-left? Maybe.\n\nBut the REAL PLAY: Go **DOWN to (1,4)** to grab apple at (1,4)? Wait, board shows apple at (1,4)? No, checking board: Row 1 has apples at (2,1), (3,1), (6,1), (9,1). Row 4 has apple at (9,4). So (1,4) is empty. So DOWN doesn't get apple.\n\nUP to (1,6) gets us closer to top apples but also closer to him \u2014 risky if he moves DOWN into us next turn? Not this turn.\n\nLEFT to (0,5) gets us closer to bottom-left apples (like (3,1)) next turns.\n\n---\n\n**STEP 5: DECISION \u2014 AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING!**  \nWe want to limit his moves while growing. He has only UP/DOWN. If we go UP to (1,6), we're adjacent to his possible DOWN path. If we go LEFT to (0,5), we're below him on the wall, maybe forcing him upward toward dead ends.\n\nBUT CHAT, THINK: From (0,5), our next moves: UP to (0,6), DOWN to (0,4), RIGHT to (1,5) (our body). So only UP/DOWN next turn \u2014 that's limiting US too! That's dangerous if he comes down.\n\nGoing UP to (1,6) gives us next turn options: LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6), DOWN to (1,5) (body), UP to (1,7) \u2014 wait (1,7) is his body! So actually from (1,6) next turn, safe moves would be LEFT (0,6) or RIGHT (2,6) or DOWN (1,5) but (1,5) is our old head? Actually our body will be at (1,5) next turn? Let's track: If we move UP to (1,6), our body becomes [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] \u2014 yes (1,5) is our neck. So DOWN next turn is death. So from (1,6) next turn, safe moves: LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6), UP (1,7) is his body so no. So two safe moves.\n\nGoing DOWN to (1,4) gives next turn options: LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4), UP (1,5) (our neck? Wait, if we move DOWN, body becomes [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] \u2014 so (1,5) is neck, so UP is death. So from (1,4) next turn, safe: LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4), DOWN (1,3). Three options! More flexibility!\n\nSO DOWN GIVES MORE FUTURE OPTIONS! And it keeps us safe from immediate head-on. And it moves us toward bottom apples for growth!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move DOWN to (1,4) to maintain mobility, then loop toward apples at (3,1) or (2,2) to grow, while he's stuck on left wall. Once we're longer, we can push for a head-on kill! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nDOWN",

ONLY RIGHT IS SAFE! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\nIf his only safe move is RIGHT to (2,6), then:\n- If we go UP to (0,5): He goes to (2,6) \u2014 no collision.\n- If we go DOWN to (0,3): He goes to (2,6) \u2014 no collision.\nSo UP is actually SAFE from head-on this turn because he CAN'T go to (0,5) \u2014 it's suicide for him.\n\n**SO OUR SAFE MOVES: UP and DOWN.** Both avoid immediate death and head-on.\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER?**\n- **UP to (0,5):** Puts us closer to him, on left column. Next turn from (0,5), our safe moves? Our body will be at (0,4) neck, so UP to (0,6) is enemy body? Yes (0,6) is his neck, so that's a crash into him \u2014 but he'd be dead already? Wait, he moves this turn to (2,6), so (0,6) becomes free? Actually his body shifts: his tail (6,6) might move? No, he doesn't grow unless he eats an apple. So his body list will shift: new head (2,6), neck (1,6), then (0,6) becomes second segment? Let's track: his current body: head (1,6), then (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), tail (6,6). After moving RIGHT to (2,6), new body: head (2,6), then (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6), tail (5,6). So (0,6) is still his body. So next turn, from (0,5), moving UP to (0,6) would crash into him. So UP now gives us fewer options next turn \u2014 likely only RIGHT or DOWN from (0,5). Risky.\n- **DOWN to (0,3):** Moves us toward bottom apples (3,1), (2,2), (1,0) etc. Grows us! More space, more options next turn. From (0,3) we can go RIGHT to (1,3) or UP to (0,4) (but that's our neck next turn? careful) or DOWN to (0,2). More freedom.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** He's forced RIGHT to (2,6). We need to GROW to surpass his length (9 vs 7). Let's snake down, grab apples, increase length, then cut him off. He's moving eastward \u2014 we can loop around and trap him against a wall or our body.\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN to (0,3)!** Secure growth path, avoid risky positioning, keep options open. Next turn we can head for (1,3) then (2,3) toward apples.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING SMART \u2014 FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER WHILE WE FEAST! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

That segment will glide to (2,\u202f6) this turn, so I won\u2019t be colliding with myself after the move. The only risk is a head\u2011on with the opponent if they also pick RIGHT, but their head is far at (0,\u202f3) and they have no incentive to head straight into my path this turn.  \n\n- **APPLE HUNT** \u2013 The centre of the board (around x=4\u20116, y=5\u20117) is the hotspot for upcoming apples like (8,\u202f5) and (9,\u202f7). Sliding right pushes me deeper into that hotspot, bringing me one step closer to those high\u2011value drops.  \n\n- **ENEMY PREDICTION** \u2013 Snake #1 is stuck near the left wall with only 6 apples. Their next move will likely be upward or rightward to chase apples at (9,\u202f7) or (9,\u202f4). If they go upward they\u2019ll head toward (0,\u202f4) \u2192 (0,\u202f5) which isn\u2019t my path. If they go right they\u2019ll move toward (1,\u202f4) \u2192 (2,\u202f4) \u2013 still not colliding with my new head at (3,\u202f6). So a RIGHT move keeps me safe from immediate collision.  \n\n- **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep expanding rightward to claim central real estate.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 Aim for the next apple drop at (9,\u202f7) or (8,\u202f5) as soon as it appears.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 Build a tight wall on the left side while I dominate the centre.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 Set up a squeeze that forces #1 into a corner where a head\u2011on collision is inevitable.  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **Rhetorical Question** \u2013 Should I keep the pressure on and ride the wave of central control, or play it safe and crawl along the wall? The odds favor aggressive central growth when I already have a higher apple count (9 vs\u202f6).  \n\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f **Final Choice** \u2013 Move RIGHT to keep the momentum and stay on the path to domination.  \n\nRIGHT",
