Since moving downward toward (6,4) would bring me closer and seems safe given that the immediate area doesn't seem blocked or occupied, moving down could be a good choice.\n\nHowever, I must ensure I don't run into the walls or the enemy snake. Moving down from (6,8) would go to (6,7), which doesn't seem to have any threats. The apple at (6,4) is quite far below, so moving down alone won't immediately get me the apple, but it's a step closer and safer than moving towards the more distant apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving left towards (5,8) could be considered, but there's no apple there and potentially more congestion. Moving right or up doesn't seem advantageous right now \u2014 moving up is not possible because I'm at y=8, just below the top edge. Moving right to (7,8) could be risky because there's nothing to suggest the path is safe, and it might lead me into the board edge or into the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering safety, proximity to apples, and the current position, moving down seems the safest and most strategic step now.\n\nNext move: DOWN",
