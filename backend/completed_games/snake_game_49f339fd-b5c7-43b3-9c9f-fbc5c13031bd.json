Moving UP from (9, 5) would take us to (9, 6), which is occupied by our own body, meaning moving UP now would cause a collision.\n\n- Our immediate goal is to reach the apple at (9, 6). To do that, we need to be at (9, 6). Currently, our head is at (9, 5), and moving UP would indeed take us to (9, 6). But since (9, 6) is occupied by our body, moving UP now is unsafe.\n\n- Alternatively, we could move LEFT from (9, 5) to (8, 5), then UP to (8, 6), then RIGHT to (9, 6), but that seems indirect and risky, especially as the snake's length increases.\n\n- Another important consideration is the position of apples and other snakes:\n\n  - The apple at (9, 6):\n    - Moving directly UP from (9, 5) would be the ideal move if not blocked, but as the body is at (9, 6), we can't move UP now.\n\n  - The apple at (0, 6):\n    - To reach it, we'd need to go all the way left along the Y=6 row, which is inefficient at this moment.\n\n  - The apple at (1, 7):\n    - Located at (1, 7), which is far from our current position, potentially reachable via a multi-step route.\n\n  - The apple at (1, 6):\n    - At (1, 6), which is closer.\n\n- Enemy snakes:\n\n  - Our own snake: at (9, 6), (9, 5), etc., which are dangerous to collide with.\n  - Enemy snake #0: around (4, 6), far from our immediate vicinity.\n\n- Walls: at the edges of the 10x10 grid.\n\nGiven the current position at (9, 5):\n\n- Moving DOWN isn't advisable because it would go to (9, 4), which is unoccupied and safe, but not towards any immediate apple.\n\n- Moving LEFT from (9, 5) to (8, 5) seems reasonable; from there, we could plan to move toward other apples.\n\n- Moving RIGHT is invalid because (10, 5) is outside the grid.\n\n- Reconsidering UP: moving UP from (9, 5) takes us to (9, 6), but that position is occupied by our body, so it's unsafe now.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Moving LEFT seems the safest and most strategic next move, as it free us to navigate toward other apples without risking collision.\n\nNext, from (9, 5), move LEFT to (8, 5) to explore options further.\n\n**Decision: LEFT**",

A safer option is to move left to (4, 5), which is away from Snake #1's current path and provides some breathing room.\n3. **Future Planning:** After securing the (1, 6) apple (if I choose to go for it), I should aim to move diagonally or upward to position myself for high-value targets like the apple at (5, 8) while keeping an eye on Snake #1\u2019s movements.\n\n### **Decided Next Move:** **LEFT (4, 5)**",

Our body at (9, 6) is behind us, so moving UP from (9, 5) would lead into our own body at (9, 6)\u2014not safe.\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (9, 5) isn't possible; x=10 is outside the board boundary.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (9, 4) looks safe, as (9, 4) is unoccupied, and moving down would avoid immediate collision.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 5) is also safe; it stays within bounds and keeps options open for subsequent moves.\n\n- Considering apples: the closest apples might be at (0, 6) and (1, 6), which are far to the left, so heading left now won't immediately help, but it can set us up for reaching them in future turns.\n\n- The apple at (9, 6) is blocked by our body at (9, 6), so we can't go upward.\n\n- The enemy at (4, 7) isn't nearby, so no immediate threat.\n\n- Given the above, moving DOWN seems optimal as it is a safe move that keeps options open and avoids collision. Moving LEFT could be considered but would lead away from immediate targets and increase the difficulty of returning toward apples later.\n\nNext turn strategy:\n\n- After moving down, potentially explore moving leftward toward the apples at (0, 6) and (1, 6)\u2014these are valuable targets.\n\n- Or plan to move toward other apples on the lower-left side after initial downward move.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic next move is to go DOWN.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",

This allows me to maintain proximity to the top row and avoid any anticipated moves by Snake #1 toward the bottom. It also positions me to explore more apples or block Snake #1 if needed.\n\n### **Next Turn Strategy:**\n\nNext time, I\u2019ll reassess Snake #1\u2019s position and decide whether to move upward further, shift toward (4, 5), or explore another apple.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **UP (9, 8).**",

Our body at (9, 6) is behind us, so moving UP from (9, 5) would lead into our own body at (9, 6)\u2014not safe.\n\n- Moving RIGHT from (9, 5) isn't possible; x=10 is outside the board boundary.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (9, 4) looks safe, as (9, 4) is unoccupied, and moving down would avoid immediate collision.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 5) is also safe; it stays within bounds and keeps options open for subsequent moves.\n\n- Considering apples: the closest apples might be at (0, 6) and (1, 6), which are far to the left, so heading left now won't immediately help, but it can set us up for reaching them in future turns.\n\n- The apple at (9, 6) is blocked by our body at (9, 6), so we can't go upward.\n\n- The enemy at (4, 7) isn't nearby, so no immediate threat.\n\n- Given the above, moving DOWN seems optimal as it is a safe move that keeps options open and avoids collision. Moving LEFT could be considered but would lead away from immediate targets and increase the difficulty of returning toward apples later.\n\nNext turn strategy:\n\n- After moving down, potentially explore moving leftward toward the apples at (0, 6) and (1, 6)\u2014these are valuable targets.\n\n- Or plan to move toward other apples on the lower-left side after initial downward move.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic next move is to go DOWN.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",

With these factors in mind, I aim to balance immediate points with strategic positioning. Opting for the apple at (1, 6) in this turn ensures a safe and quick score without overexposing my snake.\n\n**Strategy for the next turn:** After securing the (1, 6) apple, I should aim for either diagonal or upward moves to reposition for the apple at (5, 8) or maintain safe distance from Snake #1.
