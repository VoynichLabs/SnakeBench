Risk assessment:\n   - LEFT is fatal\n   - UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe\n   - RIGHT gives immediate apple but need to check if it creates future risks\n   - After eating at (4,4), next moves could be UP to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,4)\n   - Need to avoid being trapped between my body and enemy snake\n\n7. Long-term plan:\n   - Move RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple\n   - After growing, plan path to next closest apple (6,6) or (8,6)\n   - Maintain distance from enemy snake\n   - Keep path open to multiple escape routes\n   - Avoid getting trapped in corners\n   - Consider that enemy snake might try to block or compete for apples\n\nRIGHT is the best move as it achieves the immediate goal of eating the targeted apple while maintaining good future options.\n\nRIGHT",

My body is at (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1). Moving LEFT to (6, 6) would be backwards into my own body - invalid.\n2. The enemy is at (4, 6), not adjacent to my head at (7, 6). They could move RIGHT to (5, 6), UP to (4, 7), or DOWN to (4, 5).\n3. The closest apples are at (8, 6) (right) and (3, 6) (left). There's also an apple at (3, 8) (left and up).\n\n**Checking Possible Moves:**\n- UP (7, 7): Safe, moves me away from the closest apples but keeps me alive.\n- DOWN (7, 5): Safe, moves me away from the closest apples but keeps me alive.\n- LEFT (6, 6): Into my own body - invalid.\n- RIGHT (8, 6): Safe, moves me onto the apple at (8, 6).\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration:**\nThe enemy is at (4, 6). If they move:\n- RIGHT to (5, 6): Safe.\n- UP to (4, 7): Safe.\n- DOWN to (4, 5): Into their own body - invalid.\n- LEFT to (3, 6): Safe, and they could reach the apple at (3, 6).\n\n**Best Move:**\nRIGHT to (8, 6) is safe and moves me onto the apple at (8, 6). This is the best immediate move as it keeps me alive and allows me to eat an apple next turn.\n\n**Long-term Note:**\nAfter moving RIGHT, I'll be at (8, 6) with a new body segment at (7, 6). The next apple to target is at (3, 6). I need to be careful about the enemy's position and potential collisions, especially if they move towards me.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nRIGHT",

Apples visible: (0, 9), (8, 6), (3, 8), (2, 0), (3, 6)\n\n3.

Evaluation of safe moves:\n   - UP to (4,7):\n     - Moves toward (3,8) apple\n     - Creates path to top apples\n     - Keeps distance from enemy snake\n     - Good future options\n   - LEFT to (3,6):\n     - Would eat apple immediately (score 7)\n     - But creates potential trap - after eating, body would be [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ...]\n     - Next move would be limited (DOWN would hit body, RIGHT would be risky)\n     - High risk of getting trapped\n   - RIGHT to (5,6):\n     - Moves toward (8,6) apple\n     - Could lead to head-on collision if enemy moves LEFT to (6,6) (but they can't as their body is there)\n     - Enemy's likely moves: UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6)\n     - If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,6), they would eat the apple and grow\n     - This move keeps options open\n\n5. Enemy snake analysis:\n   - Current head at (7,6)\n   - Possible moves: UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5) [empty], LEFT to (6,6) [their body], RIGHT to (8,6) [apple]\n   - Most likely moves: UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6)\n   - RIGHT to (8,6) would let them eat the apple and grow\n   - UP to (7,7) would position them for (3,8) apple\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Current score: me 6, enemy 6 (tied)\n   - Need to maintain or gain lead\n   - (3,6) apple is tempting but risky to eat now\n   - Better to position for safer apples\n   - Avoid getting trapped in tight spaces\n   - Keep multiple escape routes open\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - DOWN is fatal (my body)\n   - LEFT is safe but creates immediate trap after eating\n   - UP and RIGHT are safe with good future options\n   - RIGHT might let enemy eat (8,6) apple\n   - UP positions me better for (3,8) apple while keeping distance from enemy\n\n8. Long-term plan:\n   - Move UP to (4,7) to position for (3,8) apple\n   - After this move, plan path to (3,8) apple\n   - Monitor enemy's movement - if they go for (8,6), I can safely go for (3,8)\n   - Keep path open to (0,9) apple as alternative\n   - Avoid getting trapped in bottom-left corner\n   - Be ready to adjust if enemy makes unexpected move\n\nUP is the best move as it positions me well for the (3,8) apple while maintaining safety and future options, and prevents me from getting trapped after eating the (3,6) apple.\n\nUP",

My body is at (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2). Moving DOWN to (8, 6) would be backwards into my own body - invalid.\n2. The enemy is at (3, 7), not adjacent to my head at (8, 7). They could move RIGHT to (4, 7), UP to (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 6), or LEFT to (2, 7).\n3. The closest apples are at (3, 8) (left and up) and (3, 6) (left and down). There's also an apple at (2, 0) (far left and down).\n\n**Checking Possible Moves:**\n- UP (8, 8): Safe, moves me towards the apple at (3, 8).\n- DOWN (8, 6): Into my own body - invalid.\n- LEFT (7, 7): Safe, moves me towards the apples at (3, 8) and (3, 6).\n- RIGHT (9, 7): Safe, moves me towards the edge of the board.\n\n**Enemy Movement Consideration:**\nThe enemy is at (3, 7). If they move:\n- RIGHT to (4, 7): Into their own body - invalid.\n- UP to (3, 8): Safe, and they could reach the apple at (3, 8).\n- DOWN to (3, 6): Safe, and they could reach the apple at (3, 6).\n- LEFT to (2, 7): Safe.\n\n**Best Move:**\nLEFT to (7, 7) is safe and moves me towards the apples at (3, 8) and (3, 6). This is the best immediate move as it keeps me alive and allows me to target an apple in the future.\n\n**Long-term Note:**\nAfter moving LEFT, I'll be at (7, 7) with a new body segment at (8, 7). The next apple to target is at (3, 8). I need to be careful about the enemy's position and potential collisions, especially if they move towards me.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nLEFT",

Evaluation of safe moves:\n   - UP to (3,8):\n     - Eats apple immediately (good for catching up in score)\n     - Positions me well for future moves toward (0,9)\n     - Risk: enemy is at (8,7) and could move LEFT to (7,7) or UP to (8,8)\n   - DOWN to (3,6):\n     - Eats apple immediately (good for catching up in score)\n     - Positions me closer to bottom apples (2,0) and (3,0)\n     - Risk: enemy could move DOWN to (8,6) or LEFT to (7,7)\n   - LEFT to (2,7):\n     - Safe but doesn't eat apple\n     - Positions me for future moves toward (0,9) or (2,0)\n     - Lower immediate reward but safer\n\n5. Enemy snake analysis:\n   - Current head at (8,7)\n   - Possible moves: UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7), RIGHT to (9,7)\n   - Most likely moves: LEFT to (7,7) or UP to (8,8) to go for (3,8) apple\n   - If they move LEFT to (7,7), they could be a threat to (3,8) apple\n\n6. Strategic considerations:\n   - Current score: me 6, enemy 7 (I'm behind by 1)\n   - Need to catch up safely\n   - Both (3,8) and (3,6) apples are accessible\n   - (3,8) is more valuable as it positions me better for (0,9)\n   - Need to consider enemy's likely move toward (3,8)\n\n7. Risk assessment:\n   - RIGHT is fatal (my body)\n   - LEFT is safe but doesn't eat apple\n   - UP and DOWN both eat apples but have different risks\n   - UP is better long-term positioning but higher immediate risk\n   - DOWN is safer but might trap me in bottom area\n\n8. Decision:\n   - I'll choose UP to (3,8) to eat the apple and position myself well\n   - This gives me +1 apple (score 7 vs enemy 7 - tie)\n   - Next moves can focus on (0,9) apple\n   - If enemy moves toward (3,8), I'll need to adjust\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Eat (3,8) apple this turn\n- Next move toward (0,9) apple via (2,8) or (3,9)\n- Monitor enemy movement - if they go for (0,9), consider alternative path\n- Avoid getting trapped in bottom-left corner\n- Maintain multiple escape routes\n- Be ready to adjust if enemy makes unexpected move toward my path\n\nUP",
