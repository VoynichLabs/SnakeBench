No body segments yet (fresh spawn!).\n- **Enemy Position (Snake 0):** Head at (7, 4). No body segments either. It\u2019s a duel!\n- **Apple Density:** Apples are scattered. Closest apples to me: (2, 5) is 3 units away (Manhattan dist), but I need to be careful. I see (2, 8) is only 2 units away (left 2, down 0). Actually wait, (4,8) to (2,8) is LEFT 2. That\u2019s a valid path if the enemy doesn't block.\n- **Enemy Intent:** The enemy is at (7,4). They might go for (6,6) or (5,5) or (8,6). Hard to predict, but they are lower on the board.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN (Long-term):**\nGrow fast. Dominate the center. Use my body to cut off the enemy's access to the top-left quadrant. I need to get big before they do. My immediate goal is to grab an apple without getting ambushed.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **UP:** To (4, 9). This moves me to the top wall. It\u2019s safe (empty), but I\u2019d be cornered against the wall next turn. Not ideal for keeping options open.\n2.  **DOWN:** To (4, 7). This is a safe empty cell. It moves me toward the apple at (2, 5) and (5, 5).\n3.  **LEFT:** To (3, 8). This moves me toward the apple at (2, 8). However, (2, 8) is an apple. If I move LEFT, I move *away* from the apple I just calculated? Wait, (4,8) to (2,8) is two lefts. Moving LEFT to (3,8) is one step closer to (2,8). However, the immediate cell (3,8) is empty.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (5, 8). This moves me to an empty cell. It\u2019s safe.\n\n**KILL MOVES (Eliminating bad choices):**\n- **UP** puts me against the wall (9,9). If I go there, I have fewer escape routes if the enemy decides to rush me. High risk, low mobility.\n- **LEFT** moves me toward (2, 8) which is an apple. That's good. (3,8) is empty.\n- **DOWN** moves me toward the center apples. (4,7) is empty.\n- **RIGHT** moves me away from the immediate cluster of apples in the bottom half.\n\n**FINAL CALL:**\nI want to secure an apple quickly. The apple at (2, 8) is relatively safe and close. Moving **LEFT** puts me on (3,8), putting me on a direct intercept course for (2, 8). The enemy is far away at (7,4). They can't reach me in one turn.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nMove to (3, 8). Next turn, if safe, I will move LEFT again to (2, 8) to eat the apple and grow. Then I will look to pivot down toward the center to cut off the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

No body.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (7, 5), Body at (7, 4). 1 Apple.\n- **Apple Map:** There is a delicious apple at **(2, 8)**. It is currently empty.\n- **Board Grid:**\n  - (3, 8) is my current spot.\n  - (2, 8) is an apple (Empty).\n  - (3, 7) is an apple (Empty).\n  - (4, 7) is Empty.\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION:**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):**\n    - Position: Top row.\n    - Safety: Empty.\n    - Risk: High. Being on the edge limits escape routes. I could get boxed in next turn if the enemy moves to cut me off. I prefer to keep my options open.\n\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):**\n    - Position: (3, 7).\n    - Safety: Empty.\n    - Benefit: **MOVES ME DIRECTLY ONTO AN APPLE!**\n    - Consequence: I grow. My tail will stay at (3, 8) initially (standard growth), making my body length 1 (Head (3,7) -> Body (3,8)). This creates a vertical block that forces the enemy to respect the vertical line.\n    - Future: From (3, 7), I have full mobility. I can go Left to (2,7), Down to (3,6), Right to (4,7), or Up to (3,8) which is now my tail (this is a valid move for next turn, though risky if I want to preserve length).\n\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):**\n    - Position: (2, 8).\n    - Safety: Empty.\n    - Benefit: **MOVES ME DIRECTLY ONTO AN APPLE!**\n    - Consequence: I grow. My tail stays at (3, 8). My body becomes horizontal.\n    - Future: From (2, 8), I am close to the left wall. My options are Left to (1,8) or Down to (2,7).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):**\n    - Position: (4, 8).\n    - Safety: Empty.\n    - Benefit: Moves toward the center.\n    - Cost: Misses the immediate apple at (2,8) or (3,7). I want to grow fast to match the enemy's score (1 vs 0).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to eat apples aggressively. The apple at **(2, 8)** and **(3, 7)** are both adjacent.\n- **LEFT** gets me the apple at (2,8). From there, I can look at (2,7) or (1,8) next.\n- **DOWN** gets me the apple at (3,7). From there, I can look at (3,6) or (2,7).\n\nBoth are good. However, looking at the board, moving **DOWN** to (3, 7) places me in a slightly more central position than moving **LEFT** to the wall (2,8). Also, moving DOWN blocks the vertical space for the enemy if they try to flank up later. The apple at (3, 7) is just as valuable.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\n- (2, 8) is an apple.\n- (3, 7) is an apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7), I eat the apple there. My body will be at (3, 8). This creates a vertical segment. The enemy is at (7, 5). They are far. They cannot hit me this turn.\n\nActually, let's look at the board geometry. The enemy is at (7,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8), I am far to the left. The enemy is far right.\nIf I go DOWN to (3,7), I am still central-left.\n\nLet's consider the **LEFT** move to (2, 8). This puts me at the edge of the top row. While safe, it reduces my future mobility compared to staying in row 7 or 8. However, the apple is there.\n\nLet's consider the **DOWN** move to (3, 7). This puts me on an apple AND keeps me one row lower than the absolute top, giving me slightly better mobility (can go Up to 3,8 or Down to 3,6).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (3, 7). This secures an apple immediately, grows my snake, and keeps me in a flexible position to either continue down toward the center or move left/right. The apple at (3, 7) is currently empty and safe.\n\n**PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (3, 7). Next turn, assess the enemy's movement. If they push aggressively up, I will use my body length to cut them off. If not, I'll go for (2, 7) or (3, 6) to continue growing and dominating the board.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the board state and execute the plan to dominate this snake!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (3, 7). No body.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 5), Body at (7, 5). 1 Apple.\n- **Apples Available:** (2, 8), (6, 6), (8, 6), (5, 2), (9, 4), (3, 0), (9, 0), (2, 8), (1, 4), (2, 0), (0, 6), (3, 1), (2, 7), (5, 5), (8, 3).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    - **UP to (3, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN to (3, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **LEFT to (2, 7):** Contains an apple (A). Safe.\n    - **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    - I currently have 0 apples. The enemy has 1. I need to eat to catch up and eventually overtake them to force a head-on collision win.\n    - There is an apple directly to my LEFT at **(2, 7)**.\n    - There is an apple directly UP at **(3, 8)**.\n    - There is an apple directly DOWN at **(3, 6)**.\n    \n    **Option A: LEFT (2, 7)**\n    - Pros: Grabs an apple immediately (+1 score). Grows my body (tail stays at 3,7). Puts me in a position to potentially access (2, 8) or (1, 7) next.\n    - Cons: Moves me closer to the left edge (x=2).\n    \n    **Option B: DOWN (3, 6)**\n    - Pros: Grabs an apple immediately (+1 score). Grows my body. Moves me toward the center (x=3, y=6). From here, I can access (3, 5), (2, 6), (4, 6).\n    - Cons: None major.\n    \n    **Option C: UP (3, 8)**\n    - Pros: Grabs an apple (+1 score). Grows body. Stays high.\n    - Cons: Moves to y=8, closer to top edge (y=9). Limits vertical mobility next turn (can't go UP further).\n\n    **Option D: RIGHT (4, 7)**\n    - Pros: Moves to center.\n    - Cons: Misses immediate apple. I am currently 0 apples vs enemy 1. I need points NOW to build a lead or tie. Missing an apple is a slow play.\n\n3.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    - Enemy is at (6, 5). They are looking for apples. They might move toward (6, 6) (apple), (5, 5) (apple), or (8, 6) (apple). They are far away (Manhattan distance > 5). They cannot reach me this turn regardless of my move. I am safe from collision.\n\n4.  **Selection:**\n    - I need to eat. \n    - **DOWN to (3, 6)** seems optimal. Why?\n        - It grabs the apple at (3, 6).\n        - It places my head at (3, 6). From here, I have access to the central column and can pivot left or right next turn.\n        - It keeps my x-coordinate central (3), whereas LEFT moves me to x=2 (edge), UP moves me to y=8 (edge).\n        - Growing my body at (3, 7) creates a block that the enemy has to respect if they try to come up my column.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3, 6) to tie the score 1-1. From (3, 6), look to pivot toward the cluster of apples at (2, 6) or (4, 6) or (5, 5). Maintain central control to cut off the enemy's access to the top half of the board if they push up.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

It grabs the immediate apple, increasing my length and preserving flexibility for future maneuvers. It also keeps open corridors away from the enemy while I expand.\n\nShort-term plan: take the apple at (6,6) this turn, then push to create a small buffer zone around my head to prevent trap setups by the rival.

No body.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 6), Body at [(6, 5), (7, 5)]. They just moved UP from (6, 5) to (6, 6). They ate an apple there.\n- **Score:** I'm at 0, Enemy is at 3. I'm behind, but the game is still early.\n- **Current Board:** Looking at the updated map from Turn 3:\n  - (3, 6) is my head.\n  - (6, 6) is enemy head.\n  - I see apples at (2, 8), (2, 7), (8, 6), (5, 2), (9, 4), (3, 0), (9, 0), (2, 0), (0, 6), (3, 1), (5, 5), (8, 3), (0, 3).\n  - **IMMEDIATE THREAT:** The enemy is at (6, 6) and I am at (3, 6). We are on the same horizontal row (y=6), separated by columns 4 and 5.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    - **UP to (3, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN to (3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **LEFT to (2, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **NO IMMEDIATE DEATH.**\n\n2.  **Enemy Prediction & Threat Assessment:**\n    - The enemy is at (6, 6) with a body at (6, 5).\n    - They are on the right side of the board. I am on the left.\n    - **CRITICAL:** If I move RIGHT to (4, 6), I am moving *closer* to the enemy. If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 6), we will be adjacent (distance 1).\n    - If I stay on row 6, I risk a collision if the enemy decides to push left aggressively.\n    - The enemy is likely focused on eating apples on the right side ((8, 6), (5, 5), (8, 3)).\n    - **Strategic Pivot:** I should move OFF the horizontal row y=6 to avoid a potential head-on collision in the future. Moving to y=5 or y=7 creates separation.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    - **Goal:** Survive, eat apples, force a win later.\n    - **Option A: RIGHT (4, 6)** - Moves me toward the center, but keeps me on the same row as the enemy. High risk if enemy moves left. Also, (4, 6) is currently empty, but it's a contested zone.\n    - **Option B: UP (3, 7)** - Moves me away from the enemy (vertical separation). (3, 7) is empty. From there, I can access (2, 7) [Apple], (3, 8) [Apple], (4, 7) [Empty], or (3, 6) [My tail].\n        - **Pros:** Avoids horizontal conflict with enemy. Opens path to apples at (2, 7) and (3, 8).\n        - **Cons:** None immediate.\n    - **Option C: DOWN (3, 5)** - Moves me away from the enemy. (3, 5) is empty. From there, I can access (2, 5) [Apple], (3, 4), (4, 5).\n        - **Pros:** Avoids horizontal conflict. Opens path to apples at (2, 5) or (5, 5).\n        - **Cons:** None immediate.\n    - **Option D: LEFT (2, 6)** - Moves to edge. (2, 6) is empty. Good for safety but limits future movement. Access to (2, 7) [Apple] or (1, 6).\n\n4.  **Selection:**\n    - I need to **BREAK THE ROW**. Staying on y=6 with an enemy on the same row is bad news.\n    - Between UP and DOWN:\n        - **UP to (3, 7)** gives me access to two immediate apples: (2, 7) and (3, 8).\n        - **DOWN to (3, 5)** gives me access to (2, 5) and (3, 4).\n        - The apples at (2, 7) and (3, 8) are clustered nicely. (2, 5) is also good.\n    - **Decision:** Moving **UP** is a strong play. It separates me vertically from the enemy. It puts me directly next to an apple at (2, 7) and (3, 8). It keeps me central enough to pivot later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to (3, 7) to avoid the enemy on row 6. From there, I will look to eat the apple at (2, 7) or (3, 8) next turn. I need to close the score gap (0 vs 3). I will play safely on the upper side of the board while the enemy is on the lower-right. Let them fight for the right side apples while I take the top-left.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP\n\nUP",

If I move RIGHT again next turn and he moves LEFT, we crash. I cannot let him box me in on this row.\n  - **Apple Situation:** There is an apple at (2, 8) directly above me. There is also an apple at (2, 7) to my left.\n  - **Enemy's likely path:** He wants the apple at (8, 6) or (5, 5). He's facing right-ish or down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    - **UP (3, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **DOWN (3, 6):** Empty (I moved from there). Safe.\n    - **LEFT (2, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **RIGHT (4, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n    - **NO INSTANT DEATH.**\n\n2.  **Strategic Positioning:**\n    - **Option A: RIGHT (4, 7):** Moves me closer to the enemy. High risk of head-on collision if he commits to moving left. Bad idea.\n    - **Option B: DOWN (3, 6):** Retreats to the previous row. Safe, but isolates me from the apple at (2, 8).\n    - **Option C: LEFT (2, 7):** Moves toward the edge. Safe, and grabs an apple if it's still there (looks like it is!).\n    - **Option D: UP (3, 8):** Moves directly toward the apple at (2, 8).

Staying on y=7 is dangerous.\n    - Moving **UP** to (3, 8) is the perfect counter. It puts me on the top row (sort of), grabs an apple, and moves me away from his lateral approach.\n    - From (3, 8), I have a clean shot at (2, 8) or (4, 8) next turn, dominating the top lane while he fights on the bottom right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the top-left apples ((2, 8), (3, 8), (2, 7)) to get on the scoreboard. Force the enemy to the bottom-right. Once I have the size advantage, I will cut him off and force a crash.

I'm at (3, 8) with 0 apples. I need to be careful, but I also need to start eating to catch up!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (3, 8). Body: None.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 8). Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6)]. He's on the same row as me!\n*   **Apple Placement:**\n    *   **Top Row (y=8):** There's an apple at (2, 8)!\n    *   **Below Me (y=7):** There's an apple at (2, 7) and (2, 0).\n    *   **Right Side:** Apples at (8, 6), (5, 5), etc.\n*   **Threat Level:** Immediate. The enemy is 3 cells to my right on the same row. If I go RIGHT, I close the distance. If he goes LEFT, we might collide next turn. However, with his body trailing down at (6, 7) and (6, 6), he's effectively blocking the column to his right if I wanted to flank him, but he's open on the left.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    *   **UP (3, 9):** Valid coordinates. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 7):** Valid coordinates. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 8):** Valid coordinates. **APPLE!** Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 8):** Valid coordinates. Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Positioning:**\n    *   **Option A: RIGHT (4, 8):** Moves me toward the enemy. This is dangerous. If he moves LEFT to (5, 8), we are adjacent (distance 1). Next turn, if I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we crash. He has a body, so if I crash into his body, I die. I want to force *him* to crash into *me*, not the other way around. Also, no apple here. Hard pass.\n    *   **Option B: UP (3, 9):** Moves me to the top edge. Safe, but limits my future movement (only Down, Left, Right next turn). No apple here. Wastes a turn.\n    *   **Option C: DOWN (3, 7):** Moves me away from the enemy. Safe, but moves me away from the apple at (2, 8). It's a defensive retreat.\n    *   **Option D: LEFT (2, 8):** Moves me toward the edge, but **TOWARD THE APPLE!** This is the only option that gains me points immediately. It also moves me *away* from the enemy (increasing distance from x=3 to x=2 while he is at x=6).\n\n3.  **Selection:**\n    *   **GO FOR THE FOOD!** I'm currently losing 0-2. I *need* to eat to catch up. The apple at (2, 8) is right there.\n    *   By moving LEFT, I secure the apple, grow my length (which is currently 0, so I'll have a tail at (3, 8)), and put distance between me and the enemy's immediate threat zone.\n    *   From (2, 8), I can then plan to go DOWN to (2, 7) for the next apple, or stay on the top row if safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the top-left apples ((2, 8) and (2, 7)) to get my score up. Force the enemy to deal with the bottom-right side of the board. Once I have size parity or advantage, I'll start cutting off his routes. He's currently facing me, but I'm taking the food and running to the left edge to secure a safe zone.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nSecuring the first apple of the game. **LEFT**!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The enemy is still looming at (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7).\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (2, 8). Body trailing right to (3, 8). I'm on the top edge, y=9.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 8). Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6)]. He's on the same row.\n*   **The Layout:** I have the entire left side of the board (x=0,1) mostly open on the top row, but there's a wall at x=0. The apple at (2, 7) is just below me, but there's another apple at (1, 4) further down.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    *   **UP (2, 9):** Valid coordinates. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 7):** Valid coordinates. **APPLE!** Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 8):** Valid coordinates. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Valid coordinates. **MY OWN BODY!** Dead.\n\n2.  **Strategic Positioning:**\n    *   **Option A: UP (2, 9):** Moves me to the top-right corner of my local area. Safe, but leaves me with limited options next turn (only Down, Left, Right). No apple here.\n    *   **Option B: LEFT (1, 8):** Moves me toward the left edge. Increases distance from the enemy. Safe. No immediate apple, but opens up the route to (1, 4) later.\n    *   **Option C: DOWN (2, 7):** Moves me toward the apple at (2, 7). This is direct score gain. It also moves me vertically away from the enemy's horizontal line of sight. However, it brings me closer to the apple cluster at (2, 0) and (2, 7).\n\n3.  **Selection:**\n    *   **CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK:** I need to see what the enemy might do. If I go DOWN to (2, 7), I am safe from a direct head-on collision with the enemy at (6, 8) unless he moves significantly.\n    *   **The Threat:** If I stay at (2, 8) and go LEFT to (1, 8), I am moving away. If I go DOWN, I secure the apple.\n    *   **Aggression vs. Safety:** I need points. I'm trailing. The apple at (2, 7) is the closest point. Going DOWN secures it.\n    *   **Future Moves:** If I go DOWN to (2, 7), I have options to go LEFT (2, 6), DOWN (2, 6... wait, DOWN is decreasing y? No. UP is increasing y. DOWN is decreasing y.\n        *   Wait, coordinates: (x, y). Bottom-left is (0,0). Top-right is (9,9).\n        *   My head is at (2, 8). If I go DOWN, I go to (2, 7).\n        *   Apple is at (2, 7). Perfect.\n        *   From (2, 7), I can go DOWN to (2, 6) or LEFT to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (3, 7).\n        *   Enemy is at (6, 8). He is far.\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go LEFT to (1, 8), I am safe but not scoring. If I go DOWN, I score.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (6, 8). He might try to flank me or go for apples. He is at y=8. I am moving to y=7. I am changing rows.\n    *   **The Play:** I need to eat to catch up. The apple at (2, 7) is there. I take it.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2, 7). Then navigate to the bottom-left apple cluster (0,3), (2,0), (3,0) to build up length. Keep the enemy on the right side of the board. Don't let him cross over to my side.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nSecuring the bag. **DOWN**!\n\nDOWN",

He has the right side of the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety:**\n    *   **UP (2, 8):** **DEAD!** My own body is at (2, 8). I just came from there.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 6):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (1, 7):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 7):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Positioning & The Threat:**\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 8). From there, he can move DOWN to (4, 7), LEFT to (3, 8), or UP to (4, 9).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT to (3, 7)**, I am putting my head in the path of where the enemy *could* go DOWN to (4, 7). That's not an immediate head-on collision, but it puts us side-by-side. Dangerous.\n    *   If I move **LEFT to (1, 7)**, I am retreating towards the wall. This is safe from the enemy's current position, but it limits my future moves. I'm boxing myself in. Chat hates a trapped snake.\n    *   If I move **DOWN to (2, 6)**, I am moving away from the enemy (who is at y=8). I am creating distance.\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go LEFT to (1, 7), I can't go UP or LEFT next turn (wall/body). If I go RIGHT to (3, 7), I'm too close to the enemy's likely path.\n\n3.  **The Play:**\n    *   I need to avoid the enemy. He is at (4, 8). If he moves DOWN to (4, 7), and I am at (3, 7), we are side-by-side. If he moves LEFT to (3, 8), I am at (3, 7), he is at (3, 8). We don't collide *this* turn.\n    *   However, if I move **DOWN to (2, 6)**, I am safe.\n    *   From (2, 6), I can access the apple at (5, 5) or (2, 5).\n    *   The enemy is chasing the bottom-left apples (3, 0). By moving DOWN now, I can cut him off later.\n    *   **CRITICAL:** If I move DOWN to (2, 6), I am safe. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7) or (5, 7), we are far apart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm at (2, 7) -> Moving to (2, 6). I need to loop around to the left side apple cluster (0,3) and (2,0) to prevent the enemy from getting them. I will use my length to dominate the left wall. I will force him to the right where he has nowhere to go.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nCreating space and avoiding the flank. **DOWN**!\n\nDOWN",

It also frees the far-right cell (6,8) for later repositioning, which is clutch for a trap if he over-commits.\n\nWHY DOWN NOW:\n- It creates a semi-vertical pressure line on the 7th row without trading away space right away.\n- If he snakes left or right, we\u2019re in position to cut him off and start a controlled squeeze.\n- It keeps a clean escape toward the top or left if he pivots into a head-on chance later.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (T7+):\n- Move DOWN to (4, 7).\n- Watch his choice on turn 8: if he tries to thread toward the 7th row or retreat, we mirror to tighten the corridor.\n- Keep our right flank (cells around (5,8) and (6,8)) available for a quick re-elongation if he slips into our line.\n\nLONG-TERM VISION (to my future self):\n- Build a boxed corridor around the 7th-8th rows to corral him into a corner near the left side.\n- If a head-on arises with better apples, take the KO if the paths cross cleanly (we have equal apples now, so press advantage).\n- Maintain safety by avoiding dead-ends and keeping two escape routes open toward the top edge and the left side.\n\nNow sending the move to the stream: DOWN\ndown",

We're closing in on each other.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (2, 6). Body at [(2, 7), (2, 8)]. I am clear to move in 3 directions.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 7). Body at [(4, 8), (5, 8)].\n*   **The Layout:** I am currently safe. The enemy is \"above\" me and to the right. If I move UP or RIGHT, I am moving closer to him. If I move DOWN, I am moving toward the apple at (2, 5). If I move LEFT, I am moving toward the wall but clearing space.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Check Immediate Safety (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **UP (2, 7):** **DEAD!** My own body is right there.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 5):** Valid. Empty. Safe. (Apple here!)\n    *   **LEFT (1, 6):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 6):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Enemy Prediction & Board Control:**\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 7). He sees apples at (5, 5) and (3, 0) and (0, 3).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT to (3, 6)**, I am stepping into the \"middle\" of the board. From (3, 6), the enemy at (4, 7) could move DOWN to (4, 6), putting us side-by-side (distance 1). Or he could move LEFT to (3, 7), putting us in a corner situation. It's risky.\n    *   If I move **LEFT to (1, 6)**, I am retreating to the left wall. The enemy is likely moving right or down to get apples. This separates us, which is good for survival, but bad for aggressive play.\n    *   If I move **DOWN to (2, 5)**, I am grabbing an apple immediately. This gives me the lead (3-2). However, I need to check safety.\n        *   Enemy at (4, 7). If he moves DOWN to (4, 6), he is far away. If he moves LEFT to (3, 7), he is far away.\n        *   **Future moves from (2, 5):** I can go LEFT (1, 5), RIGHT (3, 5), or DOWN (2, 4).\n        *   **Future moves from (3, 6):** I can go DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6 - blocked by my body), RIGHT (4, 6).\n        *   **Future moves from (1, 6):** I can go DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6 - wall), UP (1, 7 - open).\n\n3.  **The Play:**\n    *   **Objective:** Dominate the board and force the enemy out.\n    *   **The Apple at (2, 5):** It's right there. Taking it gives me the lead.\n    *   **The Threat:** If I take the apple at (2, 5), I expand my body to (2, 6) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 8).\n    *   **Enemy's Likely Move:** He wants apples. (5, 5) is attractive. (0, 3) is attractive. (3, 0) is attractive. He is currently at (4, 7). Moving DOWN to (4, 6) gets him closer to (5, 5). Moving LEFT to (3, 7) gets him closer to (3, 0) and (0, 3).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2, 5), and he goes LEFT to (3, 7), we are safe. If he goes DOWN to (4, 6), we are safe.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** If I go DOWN to (2, 5), I am effectively blocking the path from the left side to the bottom center. I am claiming territory.\n    *   **Alternative - RIGHT to (3, 6):** This is aggressive but risky. If he moves DOWN to (4, 6), we are adjacent. If he moves LEFT to (3, 7), we are adjacent. If he moves UP (4, 8) or DOWN (4, 6), we are safe. But being adjacent to the enemy is never ideal unless I'm trapping him.\n    *   **Alternative - LEFT to (1, 6):** Too passive. I lose the apple.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will take the apple at **(2, 5)**. It secures the lead (3-2). It moves me away from the enemy (he is at y=7, I am moving to y=5). It opens up the bottom of the board for me to maneuver.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm taking the lead. Next turn, from (2, 5), I will look to cut off the enemy's access to the left-side apples (0, 3) and (2, 0). I will use my length to wall him off. If he chases me down, I will lead him into a trap. I need to keep the lead and force him to make risky moves.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nEating the apple and securing the lead. **DOWN**!\n\nDOWN",

I'm ahead, so I don't need to rush for an apple. I need to control the board and look for an opportunity to trap him.\n\n**CHECKING SAFETY:**\n*   **UP to (2, 6):** This is my tail from two turns ago? No, wait. My body currently is [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]? No, I just moved to (2, 5), so my body is now [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]? Wait, the update says my head is (2, 5) and body is [(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)]. So UP to (2, 6) hits my own body. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have the lead. The enemy at (3, 7) is above me.\n*   If I go **DOWN to (2, 4)**, I'm moving away from him, securing the bottom of the board. I can potentially loop around and block him from the bottom apples.\n*   If I go **LEFT to (1, 5)**, I'm moving toward the left side. There are apples at (0, 3) and (2, 0) that I can secure.\n*   If I go **RIGHT to (3, 5)**, I'm moving toward the center. This gets me closer to apples at (5, 5) and (6, 2), but also closer to the enemy.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI want to cut off the enemy's access to the bottom-left apples. The enemy is at (3, 7). He has apples at (5, 5), (3, 0), and (0, 3) visible.\nIf I move **LEFT to (1, 5)**, I secure the left flank.

I need to dominate the left side of the board to force the enemy into a corner. The enemy is currently at (3, 7). If he moves DOWN to (3, 6), he is safe. If he moves LEFT to (2, 7), he is safe (though approaching my tail). Moving LEFT puts me at (1, 5), creating a \"wall\" on the left side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the left side (x=0 to x=3).

I need to make sure I don't get trapped or crash.\n\nLet's check my moves:\n1.  **UP to (1, 6):** Looking at the board, there is no body part at (1, 6). My body is currently at [(2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. (1, 6) is empty. **Safe.**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 4):** Board shows an apple at (1, 4)? Looking at the ASCII board, row 4 is `. A . . . . . . . A`. So (1, 4) is empty? Wait, row 4 is y=4. Let's look at the coordinates. Row 4 (y=4) has an 'A' at x=1? Yes, `. A . . . . . . . A` means x=0 is empty, x=1 is 'A', x=2 is empty... So (1, 4) has an apple! **Safe + Apple!**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 5):** Board shows row 5 (y=5) is `. 1 T . . A . . . .`. (0, 5) is empty. **Safe.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):** This is my current body (tail). **DEAD.**\n\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nGoing **DOWN** to (1, 4) grabs an apple. That brings my score to 4-2. Since I'm growing, I should be aggressive.\nIf I go DOWN, my body shifts: Head (1, 4), Body becomes [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)].\nThe enemy is at (3, 8). He can move DOWN to (3, 7), (2, 8), or (4, 8).\nIf he moves (3, 7), he hits my old tail (2, 5)? No, (3, 7) is far.\nIf he moves (2, 8), he's safe.\nIf he moves (4, 8), he's safe.\n\nActually, looking closer at the board state:\nRow 7: `. . T T T . . . . .` -> This is the enemy's body at x=2,3,4 (y=7).\nRow 8: `. . . 0 . . . . . .` -> Enemy head at x=3 (y=8).\nMy head is at (1, 5). My body is (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 4):\n- My new head: (1, 4).\n- My body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)].\n- Enemy head: (3, 8). Enemy body: [(3, 7), (4, 7)].\nCan the enemy crash into me?\nEnemy moving to (3, 7) is safe (his own body is there).\nEnemy moving to (2, 7) is safe (empty).\nEnemy moving to (4, 7) is safe.\nCan I crash into enemy?\nMy new head (1, 4) is far from enemy.\nThis looks SAFE.\n\nSince I have the lead, I should secure the apple to extend the lead. 4-2 is a solid lead. Plus, moving down brings me closer to apples at (2, 0) and (3, 0) later.\n\n**PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (1, 4) to go 4-2. Pivot to attack mode. I have the score advantage, so I can start cutting off his paths.\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m all about PRESSURE AND PACE, not chasing apples blindly. The board is tight up top, but there\u2019s big space above us and to the right.\n\nDECISION PROCESS:\n- SAFE MOVES (no death this turn): UP to (3,9), LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8). DOWN is a pure death sentence (your own neck sits at (3,7)).\n- LEFT puts us in close to the enemy column, which could invite a trap or a sloppy chase. RIGHT keeps us on the open flank but edges toward the right-side apples\u2014cool but not ideal for boxing the rival yet.\n- UP to (3,9) keeps maximum space, avoids the enemy\u2019s current vertical line, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups next turns. It\u2019s the clean, non-committal growth-and-squeeze play.\n\nRATIONALE (short-term):\n- UP keeps distance from the enemy\u2019s vertical line (x=2/1 area) and avoids immediate collision. It also maintains future boxing lanes along the top when we want to hem them in without risking a reckless head-on.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTES:\n- Use the top edge to limit the rival\u2019s escape routes and aim to pin them into a corner or a narrow corridor between our advancing head and the border.\n- Prioritize staying alive and growing, but only when it doesn\u2019t invite a high-risk head-on with the opponent.\n- If the score gap closes or flips in our favor later, we can force head-on collisions by playing into the center of the board where we control more space. If not, we\u2019ll keep boxing and stalemating to convert apples safely.\n\nUP",

We're leading 4-2, so we have the score advantage. I need to keep that lead and start tightening the noose around Snake #0.\n\n**Current State:**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 4)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 9)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(3, 8), (3, 7)] (Wait, looking at the ASCII map, the enemy body at row 7 is listed as `T T T` at x=2,3,4. Row 8 is `. . . 0`. The data says body is [(3,8),(3,7)]. Let's trust the coordinates provided in the text description: Head (3,9), Body [(3,8), (3,7)].)\n*   **Apple Locations:** I see (0, 6), (2, 2), (3, 2), etc.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):** This is currently occupied by my own body. **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** Let's check the board. Row 3 is `A . . . . . . . . A` (according to the ASCII map). Wait, looking at the map again: Row 3 is `A . . . . . . . A .`. (1, 3) is empty. It's safe from walls and my own body. Is it safe from the enemy? Enemy is far away. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Row 4 is `. 1 . . . . . . . A`. (0, 4) is empty. **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** Row 4 is `. 1 . . . . . . . A`. (2, 4) is empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nI have the score lead (4-2). I want to pressure the enemy.\n*   **UP:** Blocked by my body.\n*   **LEFT (0, 4):** Moves me towards the left wall and potential apples at (0,6) or (0,3). However, it reduces my mobility.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 4):** Moves me towards the center/right side of the board where more apples seem to be clustered (e.g., (2,2), (3,2), (5,5), (6,2)). This keeps options open.\n*   **DOWN (1, 3):** Moves me slightly lower but keeps me in the same general vertical lane.\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 9) at the top. They are likely going to come down soon. I want to control the center and the lower area.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (2, 4) seems like the most aggressive and flexible play. It opens up access to the apples at (2, 2) and (3, 2) next turn.\n(2, 4) is empty.\nIf I go to (2, 4):\n*   My new head: (2, 4)\n*   My body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]\n*   This move doesn't trap me. It keeps the path open.\n*   The enemy is far away. A head-on collision is unlikely this turn.\n\nLet's secure the board. (2, 4) is the move. It points me toward the central apples.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 4) to position for the apples at (2, 2) and (3, 2).

Currently, our head is at `(2, 4)` (based on the \"Last Move\" analysis, even though the prompt text says `(2,4)` for the head, I will assume the `RIGHT` move was successful and I am now at `(2, 4)`).\n\nLet's look at the board state and plan our next move.\n\n**Board Analysis (Top-Right focus):**\n*   **Our Head:** (2, 4)\n*   **Our Body:** [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (2, 9) (Wait, looking at the ASCII map: Row 9 is `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .` which suggests the enemy head is at x=3, y=9? Actually, the text says `(2, 9)`. Let's check the ASCII: Row 9 is `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .` -> x=2 is `0`? No, x=2 is empty? Let's count indices:\n    Row 9: `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    Col: 0 1 2 3 4 ...\n    `0` is at col 2? No, `0` is at col 3. `T` is at col 4.\n    The text says Enemy Head is `(2, 9)`. ASCII shows `0` at x=3. There is a discrepancy.\n    Let's trust the **text description** provided in the prompt: \"Snake #0 - Head: (2, 9), Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8)]\".\n    But the ASCII map shows:\n    Row 9: `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    This implies x=2 is `.`? Wait, let's look closely.\n    Columns 0-9.\n    `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    Index 0: `9` (Label)\n    Index 1: `.`\n    Index 2: `.`\n    Index 3: `0`\n    Index 4: `T`\n    So `0` is at x=3. `T` is at x=4.\n    The text says Head (2,9). ASCII says Head (3,9).\n    The text says Body [(3,9), (3,8)].\n    ASCII shows Row 9, x=4 is `T`. Row 8, x=3 is `T`.\n    Wait, if Head is (2,9), x=2. ASCII x=2 is `.`.\n    If Head is (3,9), x=3. ASCII x=3 is `0`.\n    Let's look at the text again: \"Snake #0 - Head: (2, 9), Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8)]\".\n    This is contradictory. `Head (2,9)` and `Body (3,9)` are adjacent? Yes.\n    But ASCII shows `0` at x=3.\n    I will trust the **ASCII Map** for physical positioning because it's visual.\n    ASCII Map:\n    Row 9: `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .` -> (3,9) is Head (`0`), (4,9) is Body (`T`).\n    Row 8: `8 . . . T . . . . . .` -> (3,8) is Body (`T`).\n    So Enemy Head is actually at **(3, 9)**.\n    The text description might be slightly off or using a different coordinate system? No, standard grid.\n    Let's look at the prompt text again: \"Snake #0 - Head: (2, 9), Body: [(3, 9), (3, 8)]\".\n    Let's look at the map again.\n    Row 9: `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    If I map this to coordinates (x, y):\n    (0,9): `.`\n    (1,9): `.`\n    (2,9): `.`? No, the third character is `0`.\n    So (2,9) is `0`.\n    Wait, the ASCII grid labels start at 0.\n    `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    The characters are at indices 1 through 10 representing columns 0-9?\n    No, usually the label is separate.\n    Let's parse the ASCII strictly:\n    Row 9 label is '9'.\n    Then space.\n    Then characters for col 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    Col 0: `.`\n    Col 1: `.`\n    Col 2: `0`? No, the third character is `0`.\n    Actually, let's count the spaces.\n    `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    `9` (label)\n    ` ` (separator)\n    `.` (col 0)\n    ` ` (separator)\n    `.` (col 1)\n    ` ` (separator)\n    `0` (col 2) -> Wait, the input uses `.` for empty and `A` for apple. Snake 0 is `0`. Snake 1 is `1`. Trailing parts are `T`.\n    So `0` is the head of Snake 0.\n    The sequence is: `9` (label) `.` `.` `0` `T` ...\n    This corresponds to columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4?\n    No, standard formatting usually has spaces between cells.\n    Let's look at the map provided in the prompt.\n    `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n    If we assume the first char is the row label, and subsequent chars (separated by spaces) are cells:\n    Cells: `.`, `.`, `0`, `T`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `.`\n    Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    So (2,9) is `0`. (3,9) is `T`.\n    This matches the text description: Head (2,9), Body (3,9).\n    My bad, I miscounted the ASCII columns. The `0` is at column index 2.\n    So Enemy Head is at **(2, 9)**. Enemy Body is at (3, 9) and (3, 8).\n\n**My Position (Current):**\nMy head is at `(2, 4)`.\nMy body is `[(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]`.\nWait, the previous turn rationale said \"My Head: (1,4)\" and moved RIGHT to (2,4).\nThe \"Last Move\" was `RIGHT`.\nSo currently, before this move, I was at `(1, 4)`. I moved to `(2, 4)`.\nThe board state in the prompt shows:\n`4 . T 1 . . . . . . A`\nRow 4 is at y=4.\n`1` is at x=2.\nSo I am indeed at `(2, 4)`.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am at (2, 4). Enemy is at (2, 9).\nWe are on the same X column (x=2).\nDistance: 5 units apart (y=4 vs y=9).\nThis is dangerous. If I go UP, I move towards the enemy. If he goes DOWN, we collide.\nHowever, I have 4 apples, he has 2. If we collide, I win (I have higher score).\nBut wait, collision rules: \"If you crash into him, you lose. If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\nThis implies who initiates the move? No, it's simultaneous.\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\nSo head-on collision results in a draw (both die).\nSince I have higher score (4 vs 2), I want to survive. A draw is not a win.\nSo I must avoid head-on collision.\n\nLet's look at my options from `(2, 4)`:\n1.  **UP (2, 5):**\n    *   Current Body: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6).\n    *   (2, 5) is occupied by my body.\n    *   This is a guaranteed suicide move.\n    *   **INVALID.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):**\n    *   Is it empty?\n    *   Board map:\n        Row 3: `3 A . . . . . . . A .`\n        (0,3) is `A`.\n        (1,3) is `.`.\n        (2,3) is `.`.\n        So (2, 3) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe from enemy?\n    *   Enemy at (2, 9). He can't reach (2, 3) in one turn.\n    *   Is it safe from enemy body?\n    *   Enemy body at (3, 9) and (3, 8). Safe.\n    *   **VALID & SAFE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):**\n    *   Is it empty?\n    *   (1, 4) is currently my body (specifically, the segment behind my head).\n    *   Wait, `(1, 4)` is part of my body list `[(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]`.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1, 4), I am moving into my own body.\n    *   Rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **INVALID.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):**\n    *   Is it empty?\n    *   Row 4: `. T 1 . . . . . . A`\n    *   Columns:\n        0: `.` (Wait, ASCII row 4 starts with a space? No, `4 . T 1 ...`)\n        Let's map row 4: `4 . T 1 . . . . . . A`\n        It seems there are spaces between characters.\n        Let's look at the prompt formatting.\n        `9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n        `8 . . . T . . . . . .`\n        `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n        `6 A . T . . . . . A .`\n        `5 . T T . . A . . . .`\n        `4 . T 1 . . . . . . A`\n        `3 A . . . . . . . A .`\n        `2 . . A A . A A . . .`\n        `1 . . . A A . . . . .`\n        `0 . . A A . . . . . A`\n        Columns 0-9.\n        Row 4: `4 . T 1 . . . . . . A`\n        Col 0: `.`\n        Col 1: `T` (Part of my body? Wait. My body is (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6). (1,4) is at x=1, y=4. So yes, `T` is my body).\n        Col 2: `1` (My head).\n        Col 3: `.` (This is (3, 4)).\n    *   So (3, 4) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe from enemy?\n    *   Enemy at (2, 9). Safe.\n    *   Is it safe from enemy body?\n    *   Enemy body at (3, 9) and (3, 8). Safe.\n    *   **VALID & SAFE.**\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Moves me away from the enemy (who is at y=9). Opens up the bottom area. Row 3 has an apple at (0, 3) and (3, 3)? No, Row 3: `A . . . . . . . A .` -> (0,3) is A, (8,3) is A. (2, 3) is empty. Moving down allows me to potentially access (0,3) or (8,3) or apples in Row 2 (many apples there). This seems safe and opens up the lower board.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Moves me horizontally. Row 4 has an apple at (9, 4). But there's a `T` at (1, 4) and (1, 5). Moving right puts me at (3, 4). From there I can go UP to (3, 5)? Row 5: `. T T . . A ...` -> (3, 5) is `T` (Body). So UP is blocked. I can go LEFT (back to 2,4 - body). I can go RIGHT (4,4). I can go DOWN (3,3). (3,3) is empty (Row 3: `. . . .`). So RIGHT gives me options: RIGHT or DOWN.\n    However, if I go RIGHT, my body will shift. (1,4) becomes free? No, (2,4) becomes body.\n    Let's look at the `T` at (1,4). It's part of my body.\n    If I go RIGHT to (3,4):\n    New Head: (3,4).\n    New Body: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)].\n    The tail (2,6) moves off (if not eating).\n    Is (3,4) safe?\n    Yes.\n    Is (3,3) safe next turn?\n    Yes.\n    Is (4,4) safe next turn?\n    Yes.\n\n**Aggression & Trapping:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 9).\nIf I go **DOWN to (2, 3)**, I increase the distance.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (3, 4)**, I stay at y=4, x=3.\nThe enemy is at x=2, y=9.\nIf I am at (3, 4), I am to the right of the enemy's column.\nThe enemy is pinned somewhat by the wall at x=9? No, he is at x=2.\nWait, looking at the board, the right side is mostly empty.\nThere are apples at (5,5), (8,6), (9,4), (6,2), (3,2).\n(3,2) is close to me.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), I am at x=2.\nNext turn I could go LEFT to (1,3) or RIGHT to (3,3) or DOWN to (2,2).\n(2,2) is an apple (`A`).\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3), I am blocking the vertical line x=2.\nThe enemy is at x=2.\nIf I stay on x=2, and the enemy comes down, we might meet.\nBut going DOWN puts me at (2,3).\nEnemy at (2,9).\nHe needs 6 moves to reach me. I need 6 moves to reach him.\nIf I stay on this line, it's a race? No, I have the score advantage.\nI should NOT risk a draw.\nI should maneuver to trap him in the top-right corner (x > 5, y > 5).\nTo do that, I need to move RIGHT.\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 4) positions me centrally.\nFrom (3, 4), I can move to (4, 4), (5, 4), etc.\nThe apples on the right are at (5,5), (8,6), (9,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I head towards (9, 4).\nIf I go DOWN, I head towards (2,2) or (0,3).\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nI have score advantage (4-2). I want to restrict the enemy.\nThe enemy is at the top left (x=2, y=9).\nI am at (2, 4).\nIf I move RIGHT, I open up the path to the right wall.\nI can then climb up the right side (x=8,9) and eat apples there.\nThe enemy is on the left side.\nIf I control the right side, I can eventually cut him off.\nIf I go DOWN, I move away from the enemy and towards the cluster of apples at the bottom (Row 0, 1, 2).\nRow 2 has many apples: (2,2), (3,2), (5,2)?? No, Row 2: `. . A A . A A . . .`\nApples at (2,2), (3,2), (5,2)? No, (5,2) is `.`? Let's check Row 2.\n`2 . . A A . A A . . .`\nIndices: 0: `.`, 1: `.`, 2: `A`, 3: `A`, 4: `.`, 5: `A`, 6: `A`, ...\nSo (2,2) is A. (3,2) is A. (5,2) is A. (6,2) is A.\nThis is a dense cluster.\nIf I go DOWN, I can eat (2,2) or (3,2) quickly.\nEating apples grows my body, making me harder to kill.\nBut growing also reduces mobility.\nHowever, (2,2) is directly below me at (2,4).\nDistance: (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2). 2 moves.\nIf I go DOWN now to (2,3), next turn I can go DOWN to (2,2) and eat.\nThat's a guaranteed point.\nIf I go RIGHT, I don't see an immediate apple.\nRow 4 has an apple at (9,4). That's far (5 moves).\nRow 5 has an apple at (5,5). That's diagonal.\nRow 3 has an apple at (3,3)? No, Row 3: `A . . . . . . . A .` -> (0,3) and (8,3).\n(3,3) is empty.\n\n**Decision:**\nOption A: DOWN to (2, 3).\n- Immediate safety? Yes.\n- Next turn options? (1,3), (3,3), (2,2).\n- (2,2) is an apple. Eating it gives me 5 apples (2x lead).\n- This solidifies my lead and adds body length.\n- Does it help trap the enemy? Not directly, but a bigger snake is a better blocker.\n- Enemy is far away.\n\nOption B: RIGHT to (3, 4).\n- Positions me towards the right side.\n- Next turn options? (4,4), (3,3), (2,4) [backwards, bad].\n- No immediate apple.\n- Enemy is at (2,9). If I go RIGHT, I leave the x=2 column open.\n- If I go RIGHT, I can potentially loop around to the top right.\n- But the enemy might come down x=2.\n- If enemy comes down x=2, and I am at (3,4), I can ambush him later?\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 9).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), I am on the same column.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN (aggressive), he moves to (2, 8).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), and he goes DOWN to (2, 8), we are 5 cells apart.\nIf I eat (2,2) next turn, I am at (2,2) with length 6.\nHe would be at (2, 7) or (2, 8).\nIf he continues down, we might meet at (2, 5) or (2, 4).\nMy body is currently at (2, 5) and (2, 6).\nSo (2, 5) is occupied by ME.\nIf the enemy tries to pass through (2, 5), he dies.\nSo if I stay on x=2, I have a \"wall\" of my own body at (2, 5) and (2, 6).\nCurrently: Head (2, 4). Body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6).\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3):\nNew Head: (2, 3).\nNew Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)].\nOld tail (2, 6) leaves.\nSo my body will be:\n(2, 3) - Head\n(2, 4) - Neck\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(2, 5)\nSo I will have a body segment at (2, 4) and (2, 5).\nThis forms a vertical barrier at x=2, y=4,5.\nThe enemy at (2, 9) would have to pass through (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4) to get to me.\n(2, 6) will be empty after I move (tail moves).\n(2, 5) is occupied.\n(2, 4) is occupied.\nSo if the enemy moves into (2, 5) or (2, 4), he dies.\nThis is a strong defensive position. I can \"own\" the x=2 column.\nFrom (2, 3), I can eat (2, 2) next turn.\nThen I can move LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf I move LEFT, I can clear the column.\nIf I move RIGHT, I can cut across.\nActually, if I go DOWN to (2, 3), I am effectively claiming the bottom half of column 2.\nThe enemy is in the top half.\nThis seems like a good strategy to control the column and eventually force the enemy into a corner or into my body.\n\nLet's compare with RIGHT (3, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I leave column 2.\nThe enemy is at (2, 9).\nIf the enemy goes DOWN, he enters column 2 freely.\nHe can eat apples at (2, 2) etc.\nI would be at (3, 4).\nI would have to chase him or navigate around.\nBy staying on column 2 (going DOWN), I prevent him from easily accessing the bottom-left apples.\nI also maintain the \"body wall\" at (2, 5).\nWait, if I go DOWN, my body shifts.\nCurrent body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6).\nNext body (if DOWN): (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5).\nSo (2, 5) remains a body part. (2, 4) becomes a body part.\nThis is a solid blockade.\nIf I go RIGHT, my body becomes: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5).\nWait, that's the same list?\nNo, if I go RIGHT to (3, 4):\nHead: (3, 4).\nBody: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)].\nSame body parts! Just shifted.\n(2, 4) becomes body. (1, 4) becomes body. (1, 5) becomes body. (2, 5) becomes body.\nSo both moves result in the same body configuration relative to the head?\nNo, the positions differ.\nDOWN:\nHead (2, 3). Body: (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).\nRIGHT:\nHead (3, 4). Body: (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).\n\nThe key difference is the HEAD position.\nHead at (2, 3) vs Head at (3, 4).\n\n**Apple Focus:**\nI am ignoring apples per instructions, but eating is good for score.\nApple at (2, 2) is very close. 2 moves away.\nApple at (3, 2) is also close.\nApple at (0, 3) is close.\nIf I go DOWN, I am setting up to eat (2, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from these apples.\n\n**Trapping the Enemy:**\nEnemy is at (2, 9).\nIf I control column 2, I restrict his movement.\nIf I go DOWN, I am \"behind\" him in terms of column access? No, I am lower.\nIf he goes DOWN, he hits my body at (2, 5) or (2, 4).\nIf he goes RIGHT (to x=3), he is in column 3.\nIf I am at (2, 3), I am below him.\nIf he goes to (3, 9), (3, 8)...\nI can eventually move to column 3 and trap him there.\nBut keeping him off column 2 is valuable.\nThe apples at (2, 2) and (3, 2) are in columns 2 and 3.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), I can eat (2, 2) next turn.\nThen I can go to (3, 2) or (1, 2).\nIf I go DOWN, I secure the food.\nIf I go RIGHT, I give up the immediate food security.\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing **DOWN** seems more solid.\n1. Secures the x=2 column.\n2. Sets up a guaranteed apple (2, 2) next turn.\n3. Maintains score lead (4 vs 2) and grows it.\n4. The enemy is far away (y=9) and poses no immediate threat to (2, 3).\n5. Avoids potential collision on x=2 (since I will have body parts blocking).\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (2, 3), and the enemy goes DOWN to (2, 8), no collision.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (2, 8) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 6)...\nMy body will be at (2, 4) and (2, 5).\nSo when he reaches (2, 6), he is safe.\nIf he reaches (2, 5), he dies.\nI will be at (2, 2) eating an apple.\nThis creates a standoff.\nI can then move to (1, 2) or (3, 2).\nIf I move to (1, 2), I keep blocking.\nIf I move to (3, 2), I open up column 2 for him?\nIf I eat (2, 2), my tail grows.\nIf I don't eat, my tail moves from (2, 5) to (1, 5).\nIf I eat (2, 2) next turn, my tail stays at (2, 5) (approx).\nSo the blockade remains.\n\nLet's look at the move RIGHT to (3, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (3, 4).\nEnemy at (2, 9).\nIf enemy goes DOWN, he is at (2, 8).\nI am at (3, 4).\nI am not blocking his path on x=2.\nHe can slide down x=2 and eat the apples I wanted.\nThis is bad. I should control the resources.\n\nSo, **DOWN** is the move to secure the local area and food.\n\nIs (2, 3) safe from MY body?\nCurrent body: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6).\n(2, 3) is not in this list.\nIs it safe from Enemy Body?\n(3, 9), (3, 8). No.\nIs it safe from walls?\n0 <= 2 <= 9, 0 <= 3 <= 9. Yes.\n\nLong term plan: Eat the apple at (2, 2) next turn. Then maneuver to trap the enemy in the top right while hoarding the bottom left apples.\n\nOne check: Is (2, 3) adjacent to (2, 4)?\n(2, 4) will be my neck.\n(2, 5) is my body.\n(1, 4) is my body.\n(1, 5) is my body.\nSafe.\n\nFinal check on UP:\nUP is (2, 5). (2, 5) is in my body list. DEATH.\n\nFinal check on LEFT:\nLEFT is (1, 4). (1, 4) is in my body list. DEATH.\n\nFinal check on RIGHT:\nRIGHT is (3, 4). Empty. Safe.\n\nSo choices are DOWN or RIGHT.\nDOWN secures food and blocks column 2.\nRIGHT moves towards the center/right.\n\nGiven the \"aggressive\" and \"box him in\" instructions, securing food and blocking his access to my territory (bottom left) is key. If I let him eat the bottom apples, he catches up in score.\nI am at 4. He is at 2.\nI need to get to 5.\n(2, 2) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I can get it next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT, I delay getting it.\nThe apples at (3, 2) and (2, 2) are right there.\nI should take them.\n\nTherefore, **DOWN** is the optimal move for this turn.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (2, 3). Next turn, move DOWN to (2, 2) to eat the apple. Then pivot to trap the enemy.\n\nDecision: DOWN.YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE and the pressure is ON! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down this board. I'm at **(2, 4)** after that slick move RIGHT last turn. The enemy is chilling at **(2, 9)**, staring down the same column.\n\nHere's the game plan:\n*   **UP is DEATH.** My body is literally blocking the path at (2, 5). One wrong step and I'm out!\n*   **LEFT is DEATH.** My own body segment is at (1, 4). I can't ghost through myself.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4)** is safe, but it moves me away from the apple cluster at the bottom. The enemy is on the left side of the board; if I drift right, I give him free range to slide down column 2 and snatch those apples. Not on my watch!\n*   **DOWN (2, 3)** is the winning play. It keeps me on column 2, effectively building a **body wall** at (2, 4) and (2, 5). If the enemy tries to rush down, he hits my body and *dies*.\n\nBy moving **DOWN**, I secure my territory and set up a guaranteed apple grab at **(2, 2)** next turn. I need to extend my lead to 5-2 and force the enemy into the top-right corner where he belongs.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Drop down to secure the apple at (2,2), then sweep across the bottom to cut off his escape routes. We're boxing him in, chat!\n\n**DOWN**",

I'm at **(2, 3)** (wait, I was at (2,4) and I said DOWN last turn, so assuming I moved, I should be at (2,3) now... *but let me check the board state provided*).\n\n**WAIT A SECOND!**\nLooking at the ASCII map in the prompt:\nRow 3: `3 A . 1 . . . . . A .`\n`1` is at x=3, y=3.\nBut wait, the prompt text says: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): - Head: (2, 3)\"\nThere is a contradiction between the ASCII map and the text description.\n*   Text says Head: (2, 3)\n*   ASCII map Row 3 shows `1` at the 4th character slot. `3 A . 1 ...`\n    Columns: 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    Col 0: `A`\n    Col 1: `.`\n    Col 2: `.`\n    Col 3: `1`\n    So ASCII implies Head is at **(3, 3)**.\n\nLet's look at the *Board State* section again carefully.\n`3 A . 1 . . . . . A .`\nThis is Row 3.\nIndices: 0 is `A`, 1 is `.`, 2 is `.`, 3 is `1`.\nSo (3,3) is `1`.\n\nHowever, the *Your Snake* section says Head: (2, 3).\nThis is a critical discrepancy. Usually, the visual ASCII map is the ground truth for positioning.\nIf I trust the ASCII map, I am at (3, 3).\nIf I trust the text, I am at (2, 3).\n\nLet's trace my previous move.\nLast turn (Turn 12), I was at (2, 4). I was considering moving RIGHT to (3, 4) or DOWN to (2, 3).\nThe prompt shows \"YOUR LAST MOVE: DOWN\".\nIf I moved DOWN from (2, 4), I end up at **(2, 3)**.\n\nSo, Text: (2, 3).\nASCII: `1` at (3, 3).\nWhy would the ASCII map show me at (3, 3) if I was at (2, 4) and moved DOWN?\nWait, let's look at Row 4 in ASCII.\n`4 . T 1 . . . . . . A`\nRow 4: `.` (0), `T` (1), `1` (2), `.` (3)...\nThis was my position *before* the move (Turn 12 start? Or after?).\nThe prompt says: \"START LAST MOVE PICK ... DOWN\".\nThis implies the move was made to get to the CURRENT state.\n\nIf I was at (2, 4) and moved DOWN, I am at (2, 3).\nThe ASCII map shows `1` at (3, 3).\nThis implies either:\n1. The ASCII map is slightly misaligned or I am misreading it.\n2. The text description of my position is incorrect.\n3. Something else happened.\n\nLet's look at the ASCII map again.\n`3 A . 1 . . . . . A .`\nIs it possible `1` is at index 2?\n`3 A . 1 ...`\nIndex 0: `A`\nIndex 1: `.`\nIndex 2: `.`? No, the pattern is char, space, char, space.\nThe prompt formatting:\n`9 . . 0 T . . . . . .`\n`8 . . . T . . . . . .`\n`3 A . 1 . . . . . . .` (Wait, the prompt has `3 A . 1 . . . . . A .`)\nLet's look at the text provided.\n`3 A . 1 . . . . . A .`\nIt looks like `.` is at x=1, `1` is at x=2?\nLet's count the characters between the row label and the first space.\n`3 A . 1 ...`\nIf it is `3` ` ` `A` ` ` `.` ` ` `1`...\nThen:\nx=0: `A`\nx=1: `.`\nx=2: `1`\nThis would match the text description: Head (2, 3).\nOkay, that makes sense. The ASCII map puts me at (2, 3).\nSo my position is **(2, 3)**.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 3)\n*   **My Body:** The body moves with me. If I moved DOWN from (2, 4) to (2, 3), my old head (2, 4) becomes body.\n    Previous body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)] (from previous turn's context).\n    New body should be: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)].\n*   **Enemy Head:** (2, 9) (Text says so, ASCII `0` at x=2, y=9).\n*   **Enemy Body:** (3, 9), (3, 8).\n\n**Move Options from (2, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 4):**\n    *   Is it empty? Yes, (2, 4) is now just empty space (my old head is gone from there, assuming I moved).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Trajectory: Moves me back up towards the enemy (who is at y=9). Not ideal for escaping, but good for maintaining column control if I want to block.\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):**\n    *   Is it empty? Row 2: `. . A A . A A . . .`\n    *   x=2 is `A`. **There is an apple at (2, 2).**\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, no obstacles.\n    *   Trajectory: Moves me further down. Secures food.\n    *   Benefit: I grow to 5 apples. Score 5-2.\n\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):**\n    *   Is it empty? Row 3: `A . 1 ...`\n    *   x=1 is `.`. Empty.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Trajectory: Moves me left.\n    *   Benefit: Explores left side. Might cut off enemy if he tries to flank left.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):**\n    *   Is it empty? Row 3: `A . 1 .`\n    *   x=3 is `.`. Empty.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Trajectory: Moves me right.\n\n**Strategy Decision:**\nI am at (2, 3). The apple is at (2, 2).\nThe enemy is at (2, 9).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2, 2), I eat the apple.\nNext turn, I will be at (2, 2) (length 5).\nFrom (2, 2), I can look at apples at (2, 0)? No, (2,0) is `A`.\n(0, 3) is `A`. (3, 2) is `A`.\nThe board is full of apples in the bottom left.\nThe enemy is far away at the top.\nI should secure the apple now.\n\nIs there any danger?\nCould the enemy move down 6 spaces and hit me? No, snakes move 1 space per turn.\nCould the enemy move in a way that traps me later?\nIf I go DOWN, I am effectively walling off the bottom right of my current area?\nLet's visualize the board with my potential new body.\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 2):\nMy body: (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5).\nI will be at (2, 2).\nFrom (2, 2), my \"back\" is blocked by my body at (2, 3).\nMy LEFT is (1, 2). Is it empty?\nRow 2: `. . A A ...` -> (1, 2) is `.`. Safe.\nMy RIGHT is (3, 2). Is it empty?\nRow 2: `. . A A ...` -> (3, 2) is `A`. Apple. Safe.\nMy DOWN is (2, 1). Is it empty?\nRow 1: `. . . A A ...` -> (2, 1) is `.`. Safe.\n\nSo, moving DOWN to (2, 2) is safe and opens up multiple paths.\nMoving UP brings me closer to the enemy. While I might want to fight, letting him come to me in a tight space is better than meeting him in the open. Also, I don't want to risk a head-on collision if I can avoid it.\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT moves me away from the guaranteed food at (2, 2). Why leave food on the table?\n\n**Decision:** **DOWN** to eat the apple and extend my lead to 5-2.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (2, 2). Then, pivot to sweep the bottom row to grab more apples. I need to reach 30 or box the enemy out completely. He's stuck in the top right for now.\n\n**DOWN**\n**END RATIONALE**",

The enemy is camping at the top, but he's way too far to threaten me right now. The board is loaded with food, but there's a **CRITICAL** opportunity right in front of me.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  **The Snack:** Look directly South from my head. At **(2, 2)**, there's a shiny apple waiting for me. \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **The Trap:** If I eat that apple, I grow to length 6. If I stay at (2, 3), I'm creating a \"tail\" that blocks the space behind me.\n3.  **The Setup:** By moving **DOWN**, I claim the point and set up a perfect blockade. My new body will be at (2, 3), (2, 4), etc. This effectively cuts the board vertically in the left-mid section. The enemy has to go around or die.\n4.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   **DOWN (2, 2):** Empty (except the apple). Safe.\n    *   **UP (2, 4):** Empty, but moves me *towards* the enemy.

I need to hit 30 before turn 150. Every apple counts. I'm turning this chat into a highlight reel, one move at a time.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nSecure the apple at (2, 2). Then, sweep the bottom edge (row 0 and 1) to farm the cluster of apples there. While I'm doing that, the enemy will have to navigate the top right maze. If he comes down, I'll be ready to box him in with my length.\n\nLet's feast! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 15 and we're on fire! \ud83d\udd25 We're leading 5-2 and I just ate an apple last turn (check the board, (2,2) is now my body tail). Now I'm at head (2,1) with my body running up to (1,5). The enemy is still camping high at (1,7) - he's scared!\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nMy head is at (2,1). Look at that delicious apple at (3,0) right in front of me! That's a free point and I need to keep stacking. The enemy is too far up to contest this. I need to maintain my momentum and keep dominating the board.\n\n**SAFETY CHECKS:**\n- **RIGHT to (3,1):** There's an apple there! But wait... looking at the board state, (3,1) is marked as 'A' (apple). That's actually the apple at (3,1) from the list! Let me check... (3,1) shows 'A' in the board. So that's safe and I'd eat an apple. But actually looking at coordinates, the apple at (3,1) is indeed present. However, I need to verify my position. Head is at (2,1). Moving RIGHT goes to (3,1). That's an apple! But let me check what's around it. The board shows (3,1) as 'A'. That's a valid apple. But I need to be careful - if I eat it, I grow. Let me consider all options.\n\nActually looking more carefully at the board visualization:\nRow 1: `. . 1 A A . . . . .` at positions 0-9\nSo at (0,1): empty, (1,1): empty, (2,1): my head '1', (3,1): 'A', (4,1): 'A'\n\nSo RIGHT to (3,1) would eat an apple. That's good!\nBut let me check other moves for safety.\n\n- **DOWN to (2,0):** Looking at row 0: `. . A A . . . . . A` - position (2,0) is 'A'! That's an apple too!\n- **LEFT to (1,1):** Empty (based on board row 1, (1,1) is '.').\n- **UP to (2,2):** This is my own body! (2,2) is the second segment of my snake. That would be moving backwards into myself, which is DEATH.\n\nSo UP is immediately dead. That's out.\n\nNow comparing RIGHT (3,1) vs DOWN (2,0) vs LEFT (1,1):\n- RIGHT gets me an apple at (3,1) and moves right\n- DOWN gets me an apple at (2,0) and moves down to bottom row\n- LEFT is safe but no apple\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, I want the apple. But which is safer strategically?\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1) and eat that apple, I grow. My tail doesn't move yet (since I ate). My body becomes: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). That's length 7.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,0) and eat that apple, I grow to length 7 too, but I'm at the bottom edge.\n\nLooking at the long game: The bottom row has multiple apples I can sweep. By going DOWN to (2,0), I position myself to move along the bottom and collect the cluster there. The apples at (3,0), (9,0), (2,0), (0,6), etc. are available.\n\nActually wait - looking at row 0 again: positions 2 and 3 are both 'A'. So (2,0) and (3,0) are both apples. If I go DOWN to (2,0), I eat one. Then next turn I could go RIGHT to (3,0) for another apple!\n\nBut if I go RIGHT now to (3,1), I'm at row 1, and below me at (3,0) is also an apple. I could go DOWN next turn to get it.\n\nLet me think about board control. The enemy is at (1,7) and his body goes up to (1,9). He's occupying the left side high up. If I go DOWN and start sweeping the bottom, I'm claiming territory he can't easily reach. If I go RIGHT, I'm moving into the middle of the board.\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully, there are apples at (0,6), (3,0), (9,0), (2,0), (4,1), (6,2), (3,2), (7,2). The bottom-left area is rich with food.\n\nBy going DOWN to (2,0), I'm positioning myself perfectly to sweep left and right along the bottom row. I can get (2,0) now, then maybe (3,0) next, then work my way to (0,0) area or over to (9,0).\n\nThe RIGHT move puts me at (3,1), which is also fine, but then I'm not on the bottom edge. The bottom edge is safer because it's a boundary - I can't die by going off the board if I'm careful, and I can use it to trap the enemy later.\n\nAlso, looking at my current body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5). If I go DOWN, I'm creating a vertical line at x=2, y=0 to y=5. That's a solid wall I can use to block the enemy from accessing the left side.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'm moving into the open and my body becomes less compact.\n\n**DECISION:** Going DOWN to eat the apple at (2,0) is the better play. It gives me an apple, positions me on the bottom edge for easy farming, and helps me build a vertical wall that will make it harder for the enemy to navigate down to my territory.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK CONFIRMED:**\n- DOWN to (2,0): Empty (except apple). Safe. Not my body, not enemy body, on board.\n- The apple at (2,0) is confirmed in the board state.\n\nPlus, if I eat at (2,0), my tail doesn't move this turn (since I grew), so my body stays exactly where it is. Next turn I'll have more options.\n\nLet me double-check I'm not missing anything. Enemy is at (1,7) with body at (1,8), (1,9). He's far away. He can't reach me this turn. I'm safe.\n\nDOWN it is! Let's get that apple and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

LET\u2019S GOOOO \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDecision Process (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n1) Consider ALL four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) ELIMINATE moves that kill you instantly: UP would hit your own neck (to (1,8)). Not allowed.\n3) SAFE options now: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. All are open; no immediate self- or enemy-collisions this turn.\n4) Prioritize options that keep multiple escape paths and push toward a central bottleneck to pressure the opponent.\n\nWhy DOWN is the pick:\n- DOWN to (1,6) keeps us centered, not pinned to the edge, and lines up a future Apple-in-path while maintaining a corridor toward the opponent\u2019s low-lying zone.\n- LEFT to (0,7) or RIGHT to (2,7) would push us into more open space and slow the box setup. DOWN buys more tempo for trap creation.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (1,6) this turn. From there, pivot toward the left-center Apple lane (aim for (0,6) next opportunity) while keeping the escape routes open along the top edge and the right flank.\n- Use the central corridor to herd him upward if he ever intrudes on your lane; force him into a narrowing path that could yield a favorable head-on when we\u2019re ready.\n- Grow smartly when opportunities arise, but only if it helps seal the trap and does not overextend into a closed space.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Build a widening bottleneck around x=0\u20132 to limit his mobility, forcing risky plays. If a clean head-on collision becomes available with a safe lead or equal apples and a prepared trap, take it.\n\nOpponent context:\n- He\u2019s currently far (2,1) and not yet closing in. Our immediate threat is maintaining space and sequencing moves to push him into trouble rather than chasing the score early.\n\nMove:\nDOWN",

I just ate that apple at (2,0) and grew to length 7! \ud83d\udcaa\nMy body is: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)] - vertical line on the left.\nEnemy is still at (1, 6) with body up to (1, 8). He's trapped on the left side with no room to come down past my body!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (2,0):**\n- **UP to (2,1):** That's my own body! (Second segment) - DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT to (1,0):** Check board row 0: `. . A A . . . . . A` \u2192 positions: (0,0)=empty, (1,0)=empty, (2,0)=my head, (3,0)=apple. So (1,0) is empty! Safe.

DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are viable.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (1,0):** Empty space. No apple. Gets me to the left edge. This positions me to potentially sweep the bottom-left area, but I'd be squeezing myself into a corner with my body above me.\n- **RIGHT to (3,0):** EATS AN APPLE! +1 point, length grows to 8. Positions me perfectly to continue sweeping right along the bottom row.\n\n**WHY RIGHT IS SUPERIOR:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE GAIN:** I get the apple at (3,0) and extend my lead to 7-2! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** I'm claiming the bottom row. The enemy is stuck on the left side and can't come down through my body wall. By moving RIGHT, I'm building a horizontal wall at y=0 that blocks his access.\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3,0), I'll have apples at (4,1), (6,2), (7,2), (9,0) available to sweep. I can move RIGHT again to (4,0) or UP to (3,1) next turn.\n4. **TRAP SETTING:** My body is creating a cage on the left. If I keep moving right and grow, I'll eventually have a massive wall that the enemy can't get past. He'll be forced to go UP and eventually hit his own tail or the boundary.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nKeep sweeping right along the bottom, eating apples at (9,0), (7,2), (6,2), etc. Build a horizontal wall at y=0 that blocks enemy access to the bottom half of the board. Force him into the top-left corner where he'll have no room to maneuver and will eventually crash into himself. END GAME FAST.\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMED:**\nEnemy head at (1,6) can't reach me this turn. My move RIGHT to (3,0) is safe. No head-on collision possible. I'm free to grow.\n\nRIGHT",

Just ate that apple at (3,0) and grew to length 8! \ud83d\udcaa\nMy body is: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)] - Still that solid vertical wall on the left.\nEnemy is still at (0, 6) with body [(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)]. He's STILL trapped on the left side with NO way down through my body wall!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (3,0):**\n- **UP to (3,1):** Board shows 'A' at (3,1) - that's an apple! Safe AND delicious. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (2,0):** That's my OWN body! (Segment 1) - DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (4,0):** Check board row 0: `. . T 1 . . . . . A` \u2192 (3,0)=my head, (4,0)=empty. Safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (3,-1):** Off the board! DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are viable.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP to (3,1):** EATS AN APPLE! +1 point, extends lead to 8-3! Takes me off the bottom row and gives me more maneuvering space.\n- **RIGHT to (4,0):** Stays on bottom row, keeps the horizontal wall building. But no apple immediately.\n\n**WHY UP TO (3,1) IS SUPERIOR:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE GAIN:** Apple at (3,1) is RIGHT THERE! I grow to length 9, lead becomes 8-3! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **POSITIONING:** Moving UP gets me OFF the bottom edge, giving me 360\u00b0 maneuvering room instead of being pinned against the wall.\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** From (3,1), I can still control the bottom area while having options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again. My body creates a barrier that the enemy can't cross.\n4. **SAFETY:** Enemy at (0,6) is still too far to threaten me this turn. He's boxed in on the left.\n5. **FUTURE PLANNING:** From (3,1) I can potentially sweep apples at (4,1), (6,2), (7,2), (5,2) etc. I maintain aggressive pressure while staying safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nKeep eating every apple in sight! Build my length advantage to 10+ so I can start hunting. The enemy is trapped in the top-left corner. I need to eventually circle around and cut off his escape routes. But first - GROW. Let's eat.\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMED:**\nEnemy head at (0,6) cannot reach (3,1) this turn. My move UP to (3,1) is safe. No head-on collision possible. FREE POINT.\n\nUP",

We're at length 9, they're stuck at length 4 - it's hunting season! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\nMy head is at (4,1) after that delicious apple last turn. Score is 9-3 in my favor! My body is a fortress stretching from (4,0) down to (1,5) - basically the entire left side of the board is MINE. Enemy is at (0,8) with body [(0,7), (0,6), (1,6)]. He's STILL trapped in that corner! He can't go left or down (board edges), and he's blocked by his own body. He's got limited options.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (4,1):**\n- **UP to (4,2):** Board shows 'A' at (4,2) - that's an apple! Safe AND food! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (4,0):** Board shows '.' at (4,0) - empty space! Safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (3,1):** Board shows 'T' at (3,1) - that's my OWN body from last turn! DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (5,1):** Board shows '.' at (5,1) - empty space! Safe! \u2705\n\n**THREE SAFE OPTIONS!** This is what we love to see! Time to strategize...\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere will Snake #0 go? He's at (0,8). Possible moves:\n- **UP to (0,9):** Board shows 'A' at (0,9) - apple! He'll probably go for it! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT to (1,8):** Board shows 'A' at (1,8) - another apple! \n- **DOWN to (0,7):** That's his own body - DEAD. Can't go there.\n- **LEFT:** Off board - DEAD.\n\nHe's going UP or RIGHT to eat. Most likely UP since it's closer and cleaner. If he goes UP, his head will be at (0,9). If he goes RIGHT, his head will be at (1,8).\n\n**MY BEST MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: UP to (4,2)**\n- Eats an apple! +1 point \u2192 10-3 lead! \ud83d\ude80\n- Moves me toward the center-top where there are MORE apples!\n- From (4,2), next turn I have options: (4,3), (5,2), (3,2) - wait, (3,2) is 'T' (my body) - but (5,2) and (4,3) are available!\n- Enemy can't reach (4,2) this turn - he's too far left.\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN to (4,0)**\n- No apple, just positioning\n- Moves me into open space, but I'd be moving DOWN away from the apple cluster at top\n- From (4,0), next moves: (4,1) [my current spot], (5,0), (3,0) [my body!]\n- Less strategic value\n\n**OPTION 3: RIGHT to (5,1)**\n- No apple, just positioning  \n- Moves me right, but (5,1) is boring\n- From (5,1), next moves: (5,0), (6,1), (4,1) [my spot], (5,2) [apple!]\n- Could set up for (5,2) apple next turn\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP to (4,2) is the CLEAR winner! Why? \ud83c\udfaf\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Apple at (4,2) = +1 point! 10-3 lead! I reach double digits! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **POSITIONING:** Gets me to the center of the board (y=2 row) where there are multiple apples within reach!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (4,2), I can go to (5,2) [apple!], (4,3) [empty], or (3,2) [my body - but wait, check board... (3,2) is 'T'... okay so only 2 safe options next turn, but that's fine]\n4. **ENEMY SAFETY:** He can't touch me this turn. Even if he goes RIGHT to (1,8), he's still 4+ cells away.\n5. **DOMINANCE:** Eating apples while he's trapped is how you build an insurmountable lead! 10-3 feels way better than 9-4! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (4,2) with my 10-3 lead, I'll have two apples right next to me: (5,2) and (4,3). The enemy will likely be at (0,9) or (1,8) eating his own apple. I need to keep the pressure on - eat another apple next turn to extend to 11-4 or 11-5, then start thinking about cutting off his escape routes completely. The board is MINE now. Let's gooooo! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMED:**\nUP to (4,2) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nUP",

Safe for him! +1 point!\n- **LEFT to (0,9):** That's his own tail (the cell (0,9) is his body). But wait, his tail is moving! Since he moved from (0,9) to (1,9), his tail will leave (0,7) this turn. Actually, his body is [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)] - when he moves, his tail leaves (0,7), and his body shifts. So (0,9) becomes the new tail? Let me think... If he moves RIGHT to (1,9), his body becomes [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)] and the tail (0,7) is released. So (0,9) is now his body. So LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9) would be into his own body - DEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (2,9):** Board shows '.' at (2,9) - empty! Safe!\n\nHis options: DOWN to (1,8) for apple, or RIGHT to (2,9). DOWN gives him a point, RIGHT keeps him in the top area. He'll likely take the apple DOWN.\n\n**MY BEST MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (6,2)**\n- Eats an apple! +1 point \u2192 11-3 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (6,2), next moves: (6,1) [empty], (7,2) [apple!], (6,3) [empty], (5,2) [my spot]\n- 3 safe follow-ups with another apple available!\n- AGGRESSIVE - pushing further into enemy territory!\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (5,3)**\n- No apple, just positioning\n- From (5,3), next moves: (5,4) [empty], (6,3) [empty], (4,3) [empty], (5,2) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options - good maneuverability\n- But no immediate reward...\n\n**OPTION 3: DOWN to (5,1)**\n- No apple, just moving down\n- From (5,1), next moves: (5,0) [empty], (6,1) [empty], (4,1) [empty], (5,2) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options\n- But moving AWAY from the apple cluster!\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT to (6,2) is the play! \ud83c\udfaf\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Apple at (6,2) = +1 point! 11-3 lead extends!\n2. **POSITIONING:** I'm now at (6,2) - deep in the right side, controlling the board!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (6,2), I can go to (7,2) [apple!], (6,1), or (6,3) - all solid choices\n4. **ENEMY SAFETY:** He's going DOWN to (1,8) for his apple - still 5+ cells away from me. He's irrelevant!\n5. **DOMINANCE:** Eating while he's snacking in the corner! 11-3 is INSANE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (6,2) with 11-3 lead, I'll likely go for the apple at (7,2) next turn to make it 12-3. Then I can start circling toward the top-right cluster [(8,3), (9,4), (8,6)]. I need to watch my tail though - I'm getting long! With 10 apples, I'm 10 segments long plus head = 11 cells. Board is 10x10, so I'm taking up significant space. Need to plan routes that don't trap me. The enemy is basically out of the game - he's just surviving and maybe getting to 4-5 apples. I should focus on eating while maintaining escape routes. The board is MINE. Let's secure that W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMED:**\nRIGHT to (6,2) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. Let's gooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

UP is off-board and LEFT hits your own neck, so those aren\u2019t options.\n\nI\u2019m going DOWN to (1,8) and eating the apple there. This grows your length to 5 and increases your board presence now, which helps you threaten future squeezes and keep escape routes open. Right now the opponent is far below, so snagging the apple and growing is the sharper play.\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It keeps pressure on the top edge but misses an immediate growth spike and makes future turns a bit more cramped since you\u2019ll be neck-blocked if you try to swing left again right away.\n\nLong-term plan note: use the extra body to threaten confinement near the top-left quadrant, march toward apples along the edge, and look for chances to force favorable head-ons only if the apple count aligns. Keep your neck protected and stay ready to pivot to (2,8) or (1,7) in subsequent turns to re-center the wedge and push the enemy toward risky paths.\n\nExecuting move now:\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s think: he was at (1,9) with body [(0,9), (0,8), (0,7)]. He moved DOWN to (1,8), so his new head is (1,8), and his body shifts to [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. So his tail is (0,8).

Opponent is deep in bottom-middle with a long snaking body around (2..5, 0..4). We\u2019re chasing a wedge toward the left edge to snag that left-side apple and start boxing him in gradually.\n\nWhat\u2019s safe right now\n- Up (1,9): illegal \u2014 that\u2019s directly into our neck. DON\u2019T DO IT.\n- Left (0,8): illegal \u2014 that\u2019s into our own body (third segment). BAD.\n- Right (2,8): safe, but currently not positioning us to trap or grab nearby apples soon.\n- Down (1,7): safe and steals space toward the left edge; also lines us up to reach the left-edge apple (0,3) later by hugging the edge.\n\nFinal move choice here\n- I\u2019m taking DOWN to (1,7). It keeps us safe, opens a path to the left edge, and lets us set up a slow squeeze later while staying out of enemy\u2019s immediate reach.\n\nShort-term plan and rationale\n- Step 1: Move DOWN to (1,7) now to start edging toward the left wall. This keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s current snaking route and avoids any risky head-on.\n- Step 2: In subsequent moves, pivot toward the left edge. If possible, slip onto the tail cell (0,7) when it vacates, then march down the edge to grab the left-edge apple at (0,3). That will boost our apples while maintaining a wedge-like position that\u2019s hard for the enemy to raid.\n- Step 3: Maintain awareness of the enemy\u2019s head moves (they\u2019re at (6,2)). Don\u2019t chase too aggressively into open space; prefer safe routes that keep multiple escape options.\n\nLonger-term strategy note\n- Prioritize safety first, apples second, but use every safe growth to inch toward a controlled corner or edge where we can threaten a boxed path. If we ever get a favorable moment with a potential head-on, we\u2019ll evaluate it, but as of now we stay compact and patient, growing where we can without inviting a trap.\n\nExecution\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

We just ate at (7,2) last turn, so we're at (8,2) now? Wait, no\u2014let me check the board state carefully.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (7,2) \u2192 I moved RIGHT last turn, so now I'm at (8,2)?? But the board shows (8,2) as 'A' (apple), and my head should be there.\n- Board at turn 23 shows my head at (7,2) in the provided board state? Actually, looking at the board:\n```\n 2 . . T A T T T 1 A .\n```\nWait, that's showing (7,2) as '1'? No, the coordinates go from 0 to 9. Let me parse this board correctly.\n\nLooking at row 2 (y=2):\n- x=0: '.' \n- x=1: '.'\n- x=2: 'T' (my body)\n- x=3: 'A' (apple)\n- x=4: 'T' (my body)\n- x=5: 'T' (my body)\n- x=6: 'T' (my body)\n- x=7: 'T' (my body)\n- x=8: '1' (my head!)\n- x=9: 'A' (apple)\n\nAh! My head is at (8,2) according to the board! But the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section says head at (7,2). There's a discrepancy. Let me check the board more carefully...\n\nActually, looking at the board state given:\n```\n 2 . . T A T T T 1 A .\n```\nThis is row y=2. From left (x=0) to right (x=9):\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: T\nx=3: A\nx=4: T\nx=5: T\nx=6: T\nx=7: T\nx=8: 1\nx=9: A\n\nSo my head is at (8,2)! And the \"YOUR SNAKE\" description might be showing the state BEFORE my last move? But it says \"Turn: 23 / 150\" and lists my head at (7,2). This is confusing.\n\nWait, I need to reconcile this. The last move I made was RIGHT from (6,2) to (7,2). So if the board state at turn 23 shows my head at (8,2), that means I'm ALREADY at (8,2) after moving RIGHT? But that would mean I'm at (8,2) right now, and the board shows an apple at (8,2) as 'A'? No, the board shows (8,2) as '1' (my head), and (9,2) as 'A'.\n\nLet me recalculate: If my head was at (7,2) before moving RIGHT, and I move RIGHT to (8,2), then at turn 23 (after my move), my head should be at (8,2). The board shows (8,2) as '1', which matches!\n\nBut the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section says \"Head: (7,2)\" which must be BEFORE my last move. So I'm now at (8,2) after eating that apple. Let me verify the apples: The apple at (8,2) is now gone (I ate it), and the board shows (8,2) as my head, not an apple. Good.\n\nSo I'm at (8,2) now. My body is: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4)] - that's 13 segments including head.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (8,2):**\n- **UP to (8,3):** Board shows (8,3) as 'A' (apple). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,1):** Board shows (8,1) as '.' (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (7,2):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (9,2):** Board shows (9,2) as 'A' (apple). SAFE! \u2705\n\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT kills me.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (1,7). His body: [(1,8), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)].\nFrom (1,7), possible moves:\n- UP to (1,8): That's his body! DEAD.\n- DOWN to (1,6): Board shows (1,6) as '.' (empty). SAFE.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Board shows (0,7) as '.' (empty). SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Board shows (2,7) as '.' (empty). SAFE.\n\nHe's still far away (distance: |8-1| + |2-7| = 7+5=12 cells). No immediate threat.\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: UP to (8,3)**\n- Eat an apple! +1 point \u2192 13-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (8,3), next moves: (8,4) [empty], (9,3) [apple], (7,3) [empty], (8,2) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options! Great maneuverability.\n- Moves me closer to top-right apple cluster: (9,3), (9,4), (9,6), (9,8), (8,6).\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN to (8,1)**\n- No apple, just positioning.\n- From (8,1), next moves: (8,0) [empty], (9,1) [empty], (7,1) [empty], (8,2) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options.\n- But moves AWAY from apples and enemy territory. Not ideal for aggression.\n\n**OPTION 3: RIGHT to (9,2)**\n- Eat an apple! +1 point \u2192 13-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (9,2), next moves: (9,1) [empty], (8,2) [my spot], (9,3) [apple]\n- Only 3 safe options (since x=9 is right edge, can't go RIGHT).\n- I'd be at the corner, which might limit future moves.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP to (8,3) is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Apple at (8,3) = +1 point! 13-4 lead!\n2. **POSITIONING:** At (8,3), I'm centrally located in the top-right, eyeing multiple apples: (9,3), (9,4), (9,6), (8,6).\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,3), I have 4 safe directions, including RIGHT to (9,3) for another apple.\n4. **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm dominating the right side while the enemy is stuck in the top-left corner. I'm boxing him out!\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (8,3), I'll likely go RIGHT to (9,3) for another apple, then figure out how to loop around without trapping myself. My snake is getting long (13 segments), so I need to be careful about not creating dead ends.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- No immediate collision risk with enemy (he's 12 cells away).\n- My body is mostly on the left side, so the right side is relatively clear for movement.\n- The apple at (9,3) will be there next turn if I don't eat it now, so it's a safe target.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nAfter eating (8,3), I should grab (9,3) next turn to reach 14-4. Then consider whether to go to (9,4) or loop back toward (8,6). Watch my tail\u2014don't get trapped in the corner. Keep the pressure on Snake #0; he's basically already lost. We're taking this W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: UP to (8,3) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

Enemies are lurking down in the lower-middle, but we\u2019re about to turn this into our box-and-strangle setup.\n\nWhat I\u2019m evaluating right now\n- UP: illegal \u2014 that\u2019s slamming into our neck (dead move).\n- DOWN: safe, but it keeps us drifting away from the left edge and the potential wedge.\n- LEFT: safe, perfect for slamming into the left edge and starting a slow, controlled box.\n- RIGHT: safe, but drifts us toward the middle where the opponent could chase and cause trouble.\n\nWhy LEFT is the move\n- It instantly bolts us onto the left edge, which is where we want to start a containment pattern. From the edge, we force fewer escape routes for him and keep a long corridor to pivot around.\n- It preserves multiple safe follow-up options: we can either dip down along the edge to the left-center and reach the (0,3) apple, or subtlety shift to the right if the enemy overextends. Keeps future space open, not just a one-shot grab.\n- The opponent is far enough away that a left-edge play won\u2019t invite a risky head-on clash this turn. We\u2019re playing the long game: slow growth into a boxed corridor, not a reckless sprint.\n\nShort-term plan (turn-by-turn vibe)\n- Turn 23: Move LEFT to (0,7). Solid, safe, and positions us to descend the left edge without crossing bodies.\n- Turn 24\u201326: Hug the left edge downward. If the tail vacates (0,8) cleanly, we\u2019ll slide into (0,6) and (0,5) with a potential turn toward (0,3) to grab that left-edge apple.\n- Throughout: keep an eye on the enemy head at (7,2). Don\u2019t chase into open space where a surprise turn could trap us; we want multiple escape options, not a single path.\n- If an opportunity for a controlled head-on ever presents itself (and we\u2019re ahead or close enough to force the collision safely), we\u2019ll take it. Right now, patience and edge control > reckless chase.\n\nLonger-term strategy note\n- The goal is to cage him near the edge, creating a wedge that slowly tightens with our body presence and the apple-fed growth. By growing modestly on the edge, we deny him efficient routes while keeping our own routes alive. When the moment is right, we snap the trap with a well-timed turn that blocks his last escape without sacrificing safety.\n\nExecution\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is still lurking in the top-left corner at (0,7), but we need to keep applying pressure and boxing him out!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (7,3) - wait, let me double-check this. The board shows my head at (8,2) according to the visual, but the \"YOUR SNAKE\" section says (7,3). Looking at the board state:\n```\n 3 A . T . . . . 1 A A\n```\nFor row y=3, from x=0 to 9: x=7 is '1'! So my head is actually at (7,3)! The board shows (8,3) as 'A', not my head. Let me trace my body:\n- Head: (7,3)\n- Body: (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\nThat's 13 segments total (1 head + 12 body). I'm a long snake now! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (7,3):**\n- **UP to (7,4):** Board shows (7,4) as '.' (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (7,2):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** Board shows (6,3) as '.' (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (8,3):** Board shows (8,3) as 'A' (apple). SAFE! \u2705\n\nSo I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (0,7) with body: [(1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (0,9)].\nFrom (0,7), possible moves:\n- UP to (1,7): That's his body! DEAD.\n- DOWN to (0,6): Board shows (0,6) as '.' (empty). SAFE.\n- LEFT to (-1,7): Off board! DEAD.\n- RIGHT to (1,7): That's his body! DEAD.\n\nWait, Snake #0 is actually in a TRAP! Let me check his moves again:\n- His head is at (0,7)\n- His body includes (1,7) - so RIGHT is into his own body\n- His body includes (1,8) - so UP is into his own body (since (0,8) is empty, but (1,8) is his body, but wait, UP from (0,7) goes to (0,8), not (1,8). Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, from (0,7):\n- UP: (0,8) - board shows (0,8) as '.' (empty) \u2705\n- DOWN: (0,6) - board shows (0,6) as '.' (empty) \u2705  \n- LEFT: (-1,7) - off board \u274c\n- RIGHT: (1,7) - this is his body! \u274c\n\nSo he can only go UP or DOWN. He's not completely trapped but very limited. Distance from him to me: |7-0| + |3-7| = 7 + 4 = 11 cells. Still no immediate threat.\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: UP to (7,4)**\n- No apple, just positioning.\n- From (7,4), next moves: (7,5) [empty], (8,4) [empty], (6,4) [empty], (7,3) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options! Great maneuverability.\n- Moves me closer to the apple at (8,6) and (9,4).\n\n**OPTION 2: LEFT to (6,3)**\n- No apple, just positioning.\n- From (6,3), next moves: (6,4) [empty], (5,3) [apple], (7,3) [my spot], (6,2) [my body]\n- Only 3 safe options (down into body). Less flexible.\n\n**OPTION 3: RIGHT to (8,3)**\n- Eat an apple! +1 point \u2192 13-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (8,3), next moves: (8,4) [empty], (9,3) [apple], (7,3) [my spot], (8,2) [my body]\n- 3 safe options (down into body). Still good positioning.\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT to (8,3) is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Apple at (8,3) = +1 point! 13-4 lead! We're extending our dominance!\n2. **POSITIONING:** At (8,3), I'm on the edge of the right side, positioning for the apple cluster: (9,3), (9,4), (9,6), (8,6).\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm solidifying my control of the right side while Snake #0 is stuck in the left corner. This is how you box someone out!\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,3), I can immediately go RIGHT to (9,3) for another apple next turn, or UP to (8,4) to set up for (9,4) or (8,6).\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (8,3), grab (9,3) next turn for 14-4. Then consider looping up to (9,4) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (8,6) to collect multiple apples while maintaining escape routes. Watch my tail - I'm getting long (13 segments), so I need to avoid corner traps.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy is 11 cells away - no collision risk.\n- My body is mostly on the left, so the right side is clear for movement.\n- I'm choosing the apple over pure positioning because it extends my lead and gives me more board control.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nAfter this, I should grab (9,3) immediately. Then I need to plan a route that collects apples while keeping my tail movement flexible. The top-right cluster is mine for the taking, and Snake #0 can't contest it. We're taking this W!\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: RIGHT to (8,3) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re trailing, but we\u2019re about to start boxing the edge and choking space around him. Let\u2019s go.\n\nMOVE OPTIONS (safe):\n- UP to (0,8): safe, keeps us high on the left edge but delays the edge-box setup.\n- DOWN to (0,6): safe, starts the left-edge containment immediately and lines us up to hit (0,3) sooner.\n- LEFT: illegal (off the board).\n- RIGHT: dead (would crash into our own neck at (1,7)).\n\nRECOMMENDED MOVE: DOWN\n- Why DOWN: it begins the edge-box immediately, giving us a long, defendable corridor and reducing his escape options. It also lines us up to grab the left-edge apple at (0,3) with a clean safety margin.\n- Early plan: slide down the edge on turns 25\u201327 (to (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) to eat that apple). After that growth, we\u2019ll reassess the wedge and look for opportunistic head-on or forced-cross opportunities if he overextends.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 25: DOWN to (0,5)\n- Turn 26: DOWN to (0,4)\n- Turn 27: DOWN to (0,3) and eat the apple\n- After that: stay hugging the left edge, expand the box, and force him toward fewer escape routes while watching his head position.\n\nRIGHT NOW: DOWN\n\ndown",

We need to keep dominating the board and box him out completely!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (8,3) \u2190 Just ate that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Body: [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n- Total length: 14 segments! I'm a BEAST! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ALL MOVES FROM (8,3):**\n- **UP to (8,4):** Board shows (8,4) as '.' (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,2):** Board shows (8,2) as 'A' (apple). SAFE! \u2705 (Wait, that's an apple!)\n- **LEFT to (7,3):** That's my own body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (9,3):** Board shows (9,3) as 'A' (apple). SAFE! \u2705\n\nWait! DOWN to (8,2) is actually an apple! Let me double-check the board:\nRow y=2: `. . T A T T T T A .`\nFrom x=0-9: x=8 is 'A'! Yes! There's an apple at (8,2)!\n\nSo I have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (0,7) with body: [(0,7) head, (0,6), (0,5)? Wait no, let me re-read.\nActually from the board:\n- Head: (0,6) \u2190 Wait, the board shows \"0\" at (0,6)! But the opponent description says head at (0,6)? Let me check the board again...\n```\n 6 0 . . . A A . . A A\n```\n(0,6) is '0'! So Snake #0's head is at (0,6), not (0,7) as the description said. The description might be outdated!\n\nLooking at the board for Snake #0's body:\n- (0,6): '0' (head)\n- (0,7): 'T' (tail/body)\n- (0,8): '.' (empty)\n- (0,9): 'T' (tail/body)\n- (1,7): 'T' (body)\n- (1,8): 'T' (body)\n- (1,9): 'T' (body)\n\nFrom (0,6):\n- UP to (0,7): 'T' (his own body!) \u274c\n- DOWN to (0,5): board shows (0,5) as '.' (empty) \u2705\n- LEFT: off board \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1,6): board shows (1,6) as '.' (empty) \u2705\n\nSo he can go DOWN or RIGHT. He's still pretty trapped in the top-left.\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (9,3)**\n- Eat apple! +1 point \u2192 14-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (9,3), next moves: (9,4) [apple!], (8,3) [my spot], (9,2) [empty? Let me check... row y=2, x=9 is '.' \u2705]\n- Great positioning for the top-right cluster: (9,4), (9,6), (8,6)\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN to (8,2)**\n- Eat apple! +1 point \u2192 14-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (8,2), next moves: (8,3) [my spot], (8,1) [empty? row y=1, x=8 is '.' \u2705], (7,2) [my body!], (9,2) [empty \u2705]\n- But I'm moving DOWN towards my own body (7,2) and (6,2) below... might get crowded.\n\n**OPTION 3: UP to (8,4)**\n- No apple, just positioning\n- From (8,4), next moves: (8,5) [empty? row y=5, x=8 is '.' \u2705], (9,4) [apple!], (7,4) [empty], (8,3) [my spot]\n- 4 safe options! Great maneuverability.\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT to (9,3) is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Another apple! 14-4 lead! We're extending our dominance!\n2. **POSITIONING:** I'm moving RIGHT to the edge, putting me in the PERFECT spot to eat (9,4) next turn, then (9,6), then (8,6). This top-right apple cluster is MINE!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm solidifying control of the right side while Snake #0 remains stuck in the left corner. He can't contest these apples!\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (9,3), I can go UP to (9,4) (apple!), DOWN to (9,2) (safe), or LEFT back to (8,3). Three solid options.\n5. **AVOIDING TRAPS:** I'm staying away from my own body on the left side. My tail is long (14 segments), but I'm keeping my head in the clear right side.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy is far away (distance ~9 cells) and can't reach me this turn.\n- My body is mostly left, so right side is wide open.\n- I'm securing an apple while positioning for the next one. Textbook aggressive play!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (9,3) \u2192 (9,4) next turn \u2192 then work my way up to (9,6) and (8,6). Collect the top-right cluster while maintaining escape routes. Watch my tail - I'm long now! Avoid corner traps. If Snake #0 ever moves out of his corner, I'll be ready to box him in.\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: RIGHT to (9,3) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

(empty) \u2705\n- UP to (0,7): 'T' (his own body) \u274c\n- LEFT: off board \u274c\n\nSo he's likely going RIGHT to (1,6) or maybe DOWN if (0,5) is actually empty... but the board says '0' at (0,5). So he's TRAPPED in his corner!\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS - SAFETY CHECK FROM (9,3):**\n- **UP to (9,4):** Board shows 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE!\n- **DOWN to (9,2):** Board shows '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (8,3):** That's MY body! \u274c DEAD!\n- **RIGHT:** Off board! \u274c DEAD!\n\nSo only UP or DOWN are safe. LEFT and RIGHT are death!\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP to (9,4)** is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** Apple at (9,4) means +1 point! 15-4 lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **POSITIONING:** I'll be at (9,4) which is PERFECT! From there I can go to (9,5), (9,6) (also has apple!), or back down to (9,3). Great options!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm dominating the top-right corner while Snake #0 is stuck. He's fighting for scraps in the left, I'm eating premium apples!\n4. **ENEMY CAN'T REACH:** Distance from (0,6) to (9,4) is huge. Zero risk of head-on collision this turn.\n5. **AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** I'm taking the apple while maintaining my escape routes. Textbook!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (9,4) \u2192 next turn grab (9,6) or (8,6) \u2192 continue dominating the right side. Keep watching my tail - it's long! Avoid corner traps. If Snake #0 ever breaks out, I'll box him in with my superior length and positioning. This is our game to lose!\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: UP to (9,4) = apple, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

UP/LEFT are not.\n\nEdge strategy: DOWN keeps us glued to x=0, closing the wedge and lining up the apple at (0,3). RIGHT would peel us off the corner and give him more space to maneuver.\n\nApples gap: We\u2019re 4 vs 14; growth and containment now matter more than chasing mid-board scraps.\n\nRisk check: A head-on with him is unlikely this turn given the distance, but if he dashes into our wedge we could capitalize on a favorable collision.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 27: Move to (0,4) (this turn) and maintain the edge.\n- Turn 28: If the apple at (0,3) is present, eat it and extend down the left column; keep widening the wedge as he chases.\n- Keep hugging the border to deny him easy escape routes; use new apples to lure him into the trap or trigger a controlled collision when favorable.\n- If he ever lurches into your wedge and you gain a lead in apples, look for a safe head-on when space allows.\n- Always ensure there are at least two safe follow-ups after your move to avoid traps.\n\ndown",

Let's keep this momentum going!\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (9, 4) \ud83d\udc0d\n- Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]\n- Length: 15!

From (8,4) I can go to (8,5), (7,4), (9,4), or (8,3) - all good options!\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** There's an apple at (8,6) and (8,2) that I can reach from (8,4). Plus (5,5) and (6,5) are still available if I snake through the middle!\n3. **SAFETY:** I'm moving AWAY from the right edge while keeping my tail options open. My tail is still long but I can maneuver.\n4. **AVOIDING TRAPS:** Going UP to (9,5) is fine but it keeps me against the right wall. LEFT gives me more flexibility to dominate the board center!\n5. **TACTICAL ADVANTAGE:** From (8,4), I can cut off any potential escape from Snake #0 if he tries to cross the middle. I'm boxing him in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSnaking through the board to grab those apples in the center (5,5), (6,5), (8,6). Keep my body as a living wall to trap Snake #0 in the left side. If I can get to 30 apples before he breaks out, it's GG!\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: LEFT to (8,4) = empty, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Let's analyze the battlefield.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (8, 4) after that slick LEFT move last turn\n- Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)] - length 15!\n- Enemy #0: Head at (0, 3), body going UP: (0,4),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7),(1,7) - still trapped in the left corner!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (0, 3):\n- RIGHT to (1,3): board shows 'T' (his body!) \u274c\n- DOWN to (0,2): board shows 'T' (his body!) \u274c  \n- LEFT: off board \u274c\n- UP to (0,4): board shows 'T' (his body!) \u274c\n\nWAIT! This is CRITICAL! Snake #0 has NO SAFE MOVES from (0,3)! He's completely boxed in by his own body and the left wall! This means he's going to die on this turn UNLESS he picks RIGHT into (1,3) which is his own body - still death. Actually looking at the board state: (0,3) is his head, and (0,4) above is body, (0,2) below is body (from the board representation), and (1,3) to the right shows 'T' (his body). So he's trapped! \n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS - SAFETY CHECK FROM (8, 4):**\n- **UP to (8, 5):** Board shows '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE! Plus there's an apple at (8,6) just above!\n- **DOWN to (8, 3):** That's MY body! \u274c DEAD!\n- **LEFT to (7, 4):** Board shows '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Board shows 'T' (my body!) \u274c DEAD!\n\nSo UP and LEFT are safe moves.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP to (8, 5)** is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **APPLE BAIT:** There's an apple at (8,6) directly above! From (8,5) I can grab it next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **POSITIONING:** Moving UP keeps me in the right side where I have board control. From (8,5) I can go to (8,6), (7,5), (9,5), or (8,4).\n3. **ENEMY STATUS:** Snake #0 looks TRAPPED! If he dies this turn (which he might), I WIN IMMEDIATELY! No need to rush anything - just stay alive!\n4. **SAFETY:** UP is empty and safe. I'm not moving into danger.\n5. **TACTICAL:** Even if he somehow survives (maybe I'm misreading the board), moving UP gives me access to that apple cluster in the top right: (8,6), (9,6), (9,8).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf Snake #0 dies this turn (highly likely), the game ends and I WIN! If not, I'll snake toward (8,6) apple, then pivot to (9,6) or (9,8). Keep dominating the right side while keeping my body as a fortress. The win is within reach - either by trapping him or by apple count!\n\nSAFETY CONFIRMED: UP to (8,5) = empty, not enemy, not my body. 100% safe. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nUP",

We're LIVE on Turn 29 and I'm ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT with 15 apples against his measly 5! \ud83d\udcaa But let's not get cocky - we need to finish this game! Let's break down this turn.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (8, 5) after moving UP last turn (we grabbed that apple!)\n- Body: Now I'm at (8,5) with my body trailing down: (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) - still 15 segments (since I ate at (8,6)? Wait, let me check...)\n- Actually, looking at the board state: I'm showing at (8,5) and the board shows a \"1\" there, so I ate an apple at (8,6) last turn! YES! +1 apple! Now I'm at 16 apples!\n- Enemy #0: Head at (0,2), body going UP: (0,3),(0,4),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7). He's still trapped in the left corner!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (CRITICAL!):**\nSnake #0 at (0,2):\n- LEFT: off board \u274c\n- RIGHT to (0,3): Board shows 'T' (his own body!) \u274c\n- DOWN to (0,1): Board shows 'A' (apple!) but it's empty! Wait, looking at board: (0,1) shows \"A\" - but that's for apple drops! Actually, the board representation shows \"A\" for apples, not for his body. So (0,1) is an apple! He could move there!\n- UP to (0,3): Board shows 'T' (his body) \u274c\n\nWAIT! Looking more carefully at the board state at turn 29:\nBoard shows:\nRow 2: \"0 . T A T T T T A .\" - at (0,2) is his head \"0\", (0,1) is \"A\" (apple), (1,2) is \"T\" (his body)\n\nSo he could go DOWN to (0,1) which has an apple! That would save him from death! He's NOT trapped anymore!\n\n**MY MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (8, 5):**\n- **UP to (8, 6):** Board shows 'A' (apple!) \u2705 SAFE + EAT! But wait, there's an apple there, but I need to check if that's still valid. Looking at apple drops: (8,6) is listed! YES! I can eat it!\n- **DOWN to (8, 4):** That's MY body! \u274c DEAD!\n- **LEFT to (7, 5):** Board shows '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE!\n- **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Board shows '.' (empty) \u2705 SAFE!\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP to (8, 6)** is the move! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**WHY:**\n1. **APPLE BAIT CONFIRMED:** (8,6) has an apple! I'll eat it, grow to 16+1=17 apples, and extend my lead even more! \n2. **ENEMY NOT TRAPPED:** Snake #0 can go DOWN to (0,1) apple and survive. So we can't rely on him dying this turn. We need to keep pressuring!\n3. **POSITIONING:** From (8,6) I'll be on the apple cluster - next to (9,6), (9,8), (8,2) etc. I'll have excellent control of the top-right quadrant.\n4. **SAFETY:** UP is apple, so it's empty. SAFE. Not my body, not enemy body.\n5. **DOMINANCE:** I need to extend my score lead and control the board. Eating apples while the enemy is weak is how we win!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating at (8,6), I'll be at 17 apples. Snake #0 is weak and cornered. I should position to cut off his escape routes while grabbing more apples in the top-right. From (8,6), I can go to (9,6), (8,5) (back), (7,6), or (8,7). I'll want to circle the apple cluster to dominate this area and prevent him from getting close. If I can keep growing while he struggles, we win by either apple count or by cornering him when he's forced to move.\n\n**SAFETY CONFIRMED:** UP to (8,6) = apple, not occupied by any snake. 100% safe.

SAFE moves: DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2).\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (our 5 vs their 15), so we want to grow and solidify the wedge rather than chase in open space.\n- Eating the apple on (0,1) will extend length and reinforce the edge trap; RIGHT would keep options but not grow this turn.\n\nMOVE CHOICE\n- Turn 29: DOWN to (0,1) to eat the apple and deepen the left-edge confinement.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Turn 29: DOWN to (0,1) \u2014 eat the apple, grow, and stay locked on the border.\n- Turn 30: RIGHT to (1,1) \u2014 stay mobile after growing, shift toward center just enough to avoid a trap while keeping the wedge threat.\n- Turn 31+: Maintain wedge discipline, look to nudge the enemy toward the border when a safe head-on opportunity presents itself, only if it improves survival and apple count.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- Hold the left-edge barrier as long as possible to pressure the rival into tighter corridors.\n- Don\u2019t chase head-ons unless we have a clear apple advantage; the goal is survival and incremental apple gain, not reckless brawls.\n- If we secure another apple cluster along the border or near (0,0)/(1,1) we can extend the wedge deeper and funnel them toward the corner.\n\nSAFETY CHECK\n- (0,1) currently contains an apple, safe from enemy collision on this turn.\n- (0,2) is our previous head position but will become part of our body in the new configuration; RIGHT remains safe for next turn after the grow.\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this turn 30 board like a true champion! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION CHECK:**\nMy head is at (8,6) from last turn (I ate the apple there!). Looking at the current board state:\n- (8,6) shows \"1\" (that's me!)\n- My body goes through: (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) - that's 16 segments!\n- Wait, I'm at 16 apples and body shows 16 segments... that means I didn't eat last turn? Let me check... Actually looking at turn 29: I said I was at (8,5) and ate at (8,6) to get to 16 apples. But now at turn 30, if I'm showing at (8,6) and have 16 segments, I must have eaten at (8,6) on turn 29. The board shows \"1\" at (8,6), confirming my presence.\n\nEnemy #0 is at (0,1) with body: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). He moved DOWN to eat that apple! He's growing and getting stronger.\n\n**MOVES FROM (8,6):**\n- **UP to (8,7):** Board shows 'T' (MY OWN BODY at (8,5)!)? Wait no... Let me trace. From (8,6) going UP to (8,7), is (8,7) occupied? Board shows at row 7: \"T . . . . A . . . A\" - (8,7) is column 8, row 7... that's actually (7,8) on the board representation? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nLet me reinterpret the board grid:\nRow 9 (y=9): \". . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 8 (y=8): \". . . . . . A . . A\"  \nRow 7 (y=7): \"T . . . . A . . . A\"\nRow 6 (y=6): \"T . . . . A A . 1 A\"\nRow 5 (y=5): \"T . A . . A A . T .\"\nRow 4 (y=4): \"T . . . . . . . T T\"\nRow 3 (y=3): \"T . . . . A . T T T\"\nRow 2 (y=2): \"T . T A T T T T A .\"\nRow 1 (y=1): \"0 . T T T . . . . .\"\nRow 0 (y=0): \". . T T . . . . . A\"\n\nSo (x,y) coordinates:\n- (8,6) is my head - shows \"1\" at column 8, row 6 \u2713\n- (8,7) would be column 8, row 7 - that's \"A\" (apple!)\n- (9,6) would be column 9, row 6 - that's \"A\" (apple!)\n- (7,6) would be column 7, row 6 - that's \".\" (empty)\n- (8,5) would be column 8, row 5 - that's \"T\" (my body!)\n\n**MOVES:**\n- UP to (8,7): \"A\" - APPLE! SAFE! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (9,6): \"A\" - APPLE! SAFE! \u2705  \n- LEFT to (7,6): \".\" - EMPTY! SAFE! \u2705\n- DOWN to (8,5): \"T\" - MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**DECISION:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to apples! RIGHT to (9,6) puts me on the edge but I can go DOWN to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,6) back. UP to (8,7) gives me more vertical space and access to the apple cluster above.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (0,1) can go DOWN to (0,0) which shows \"A\" or RIGHT to (1,1) which shows \"T\" (his body). He'll probably go DOWN to eat again. He's getting stronger!\n\n**MY STRATEGY:**\nI'm at 16 apples, he's at 6. I need to keep growing while forcing him into a corner. From (8,7) I'll have access to more apples and can start circling the top-right to dominate. RIGHT to (9,6) puts me on the edge but limits my future moves.\n\n**GOING UP TO (8,7)** - it's an apple, safe, and gives me better board control! LET'S KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Up would run into our neck; Left is off-board. So only DOWN or RIGHT are safe this turn.\n- Maintaining the left-edge wedge keeps the enemy corralled and converts potential space into a funnel later. Breaking the wedge by going RIGHT would give him freer progress toward mid-board and reduce our control.\n- There\u2019s no immediate apple on (0,0) this turn (no drop at (0,0) in the current apple list), so DOWN won\u2019t give us a growth this turn, but it preserves the wedge and future headroom.\n- If we wait for a safer apple cluster near the border or trap opportunities, we can angle toward a future head-on only if it clearly benefits apples and survival.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Turn 30: DOWN to (0,0) to deepen the left-edge barrier and keep the wedge alive.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE\n- Keep the left-edge corridor as long as possible to pressure the rival into tighter spaces. Avoid unnecessary encounters until we have a clear apples advantage or a safe, controlled head-on opportunity.\n- Watch for apple drops along the border to extend the wedge or create new opportunities to guide the enemy toward the corner.\n\nMOVE CHOICE\nDOWN",

He's stuck on the left edge, we're dominating the right side. Time to close the net!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\nMy head: (8,7)  \nMy body: [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1)]\nEnemy head: (0,0)  \nEnemy body: [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)]\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (8,7):**\n- **UP to (8,8):** Board shows row 8: \". . . . . . A . . A\" \u2192 column 8, row 8 is \".\" (EMPTY) \u2705 SAFE! Also gives me access to (8,9) or (7,8) next.\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** That's my OWN BODY (the \"1\" was there last turn, but now it's occupied by my tail)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Board row 7: \"T . . . . A . . . A\" \u2192 column 7, row 7 is \"A\" (APPLE!) \u2705 SAFE! But wait, I need to check if it's actually (7,7) or (8,7) confusion. Let me be precise: (7,7) is column 7, row 7. Row 7 shows: column 0=\"T\", 1=\".\", 2=\".\", 3=\".\", 4=\".\", 5=\"A\", 6=\".\", 7=\".\", 8=\".\", 9=\"A\". So (7,7) is column 7 \u2192 \".\"? Wait no, the board shows \"T . . . . A . . . A\" for row 7. That's 10 characters: positions 0-9. Position 7 is the 8th character: \".\" (since it goes T, ., ., ., ., A, ., ., ., A). So (7,7) is \".\" (empty)! SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Board row 7, column 9 is \"A\" (the last character). So (9,7) is \"A\" (apple!) \u2705 SAFE!\n\nWait, I need to double-check the coordinates. The board shows rows from 9 to 0, columns 0 to 9. So:\n- (8,7): column 8, row 7 \u2192 row 7 string: \"T . . . . A . . . A\" \u2192 position 8 is \".\" (since 0=T,1=.,2=.,3=.,4=.,5=A,6=.,7=.,8=.,9=A). So (8,7) is actually \".\"? But I'm standing there! Ah, I see - the board shows the CURRENT state after my last move. I'm at (8,7) now, so the board should show \"1\" there. Let me check the board again: Row 7 shows \"T . . . . A . . . A\" but wait, that doesn't show my head. Let me look at the board more carefully...\n\nActually looking at the board state provided:\n```\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . A . . A\n7 . . . . . A . . 1 A\n6 T . . . A A . . T A\n...\n```\nRow 7: \" . . . . . A . . 1 A\" (I see it now! Position 8 is \"1\", position 9 is \"A\"). So (8,7) is indeed \"1\" (my head). Good.\n\nNow for moves from (8,7):\n- **UP to (8,8):** Row 8: \". . . . . . A . . A\" \u2192 position 8 is \".\" (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Row 6: \"T . . . . A A . . T A\" \u2192 position 8 is \".\"? Wait, row 6 shows: \"T . . . . A A . . T A\" \u2192 that's 10 characters: T, ., ., ., ., A, A, ., ., T, A? Actually let's count: T(0), .(1), .(2), .(3), .(4), A(5), A(6), .(7), .(8), T(9), A(10)? That's 11. Hmm. The board might have formatting issues. Let me assume standard: each row has 10 positions 0-9. Row 6: \"T . . . . A A . . T A\" \u2192 T(0), .(1), .(2), .(3), .(4), A(5), A(6), .(7), .(8), T(9). So (8,6) is position 8 \u2192 \".\" (empty)? But that can't be right because my body is there. I need to trust the board as given. Row 6 shows position 8 as \".\", but logically my body should be at (8,6). I'll assume the board shows empty but my body is actually there. So moving DOWN into (8,6) would hit my own body. DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Row 7: \" . . . . . A . . 1 A\" \u2192 position 7 is \".\" (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** Row 7, position 9 is \"A\" (apple). SAFE! \u2705\n\nSo all three moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) appear safe. DOWN is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- I'm at (8,7) in the top-right area. The enemy is at (0,0) - bottom-left. We're far apart.\n- I have a HUGE lead (16 vs 6). I don't need to risk a head-on collision yet. I should focus on securing more apples and maintaining board control.\n- If I go RIGHT to (9,7), I hit an apple and grow. But (9,7) is on the right edge. From there, my options next turn would be limited: UP to (9,8) (apple), DOWN to (9,6) (apple), or LEFT back to (8,7). That's 3 options, but being on the edge is slightly risky if I get trapped.\n- If I go UP to (8,8), I move to an empty space. From (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) (empty), LEFT to (7,8), RIGHT to (9,8) (apple), or DOWN to (8,7) (safe since I'll have moved). That's 4 options, maintaining flexibility.\n- If I go LEFT to (7,7), that's empty. From (7,7), I can go UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), or RIGHT to (8,7). That's also 4 options.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (0,0) with body [(0,1)...(0,6)]. From (0,0), his options:\n- RIGHT to (1,0): Row 0 shows \". . T T . . . . . A\" \u2192 position 1 is \".\"? Actually row 0: \". . T T . . . . . A\" \u2192 positions: 0=\".\", 1=\".\", 2=\"T\", 3=\"T\", 4=\".\", 5=\".\", 6=\".\", 7=\".\", 8=\".\", 9=\"A\". So (1,0) is \".\" (empty). SAFE for him.\n- UP to (0,1): That's his own body (the first body segment). DEAD for him.\n- DOWN or LEFT would be off board. So his only safe move is RIGHT to (1,0).\n\nHe's forced to move RIGHT. So he'll end up at (1,0) after this turn.\n\n**MY PLAN:**\nI want to keep my options open while maintaining pressure. Going UP to (8,8) seems best because:\n1. It's safe and gives me 4 options next turn\n2. It moves me further from my own body\n3. From (8,8), I can access apples at (9,8) or (8,9) next turn\n4. It doesn't commit me to the edge like RIGHT does\n5. LEFT to (7,7) is also fine, but UP feels like I'm claiming more vertical territory\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe're in a great position with a 10-apple lead. We should continue expanding our territory in the top-right while keeping an eye on the enemy. Once we hit 20+ apples, we can consider aggressively cutting off the enemy's escape routes. For now, maintain flexibility and secure more apples.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nUP to (8,8) - safe, flexible, and keeps us moving toward the top edge where we can dominate.\n\nUP",

SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,7):** That's my previous position (where I just came from). If I go DOWN, I'm moving directly BACKWARDS into my own body. THAT'S DEATH! \u274c \n- **LEFT to (7,8):** Row 8 shows \"(8 . . . . . . A . . A)\" \u2192 column 7 is \".\" (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,8):** Row 8, column 9 is \"A\" (apple!). SAFE! \u2705\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 was forced to move RIGHT from (0,0) to (1,0) last turn. From (1,0), his options:\n- RIGHT to (2,0): Row 0 shows \". . T T . . . . . A\" \u2192 (2,0) is \"T\" (his own body!). DEAD! \u274c\n- UP to (1,1): Row 1 shows \"(1 T . . T T . . . . .)\" \u2192 column 1 is \".\" (empty). SAFE! \u2705\n- LEFT back to (0,0): That's empty now (since he moved out). SAFE! \u2705\n- DOWN: Off board! DEAD! \u274c\n\nSo he'll likely go UP or LEFT. Either way, he's still far away in the bottom-left.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI'm at (8,8) with a HUGE 16-6 lead. I don't need to rush apples - I need to CONTROL THE BOARD and prepare to box him in later. \n\nRight now:\n- Going RIGHT to (9,8) gets me an apple immediately (+1 point, grow!) and moves me to the right edge. From (9,8), next turn I could go UP to (9,9) (empty), DOWN to (9,7) (apple), or LEFT back. That's 3 options but I'm on the edge.\n- Going LEFT to (7,8) keeps me flexible with 4 options next turn (UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT back).\n- Going UP to (8,9) keeps me flexible too with 4 options, but no apple immediate gain.\n\nSince I'm already dominating, I should prioritize BOARD CONTROL over immediate apple grabs. Staying central gives me better options to cut off the enemy later when I decide to attack.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nI'm going to move LEFT to (7,8) to maintain central flexibility and keep my escape routes open. From there, I can start maneuvering toward the center-left of the board to set up a pincer movement on the enemy snake. Once I have 20+ apples and solid positioning, I'll aggressively close his escape routes and force a head-on collision where my size advantage guarantees victory.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nLEFT to (7,8) - safe, flexible, and keeps me in position to dominate the board geometry.\n\nLEFT",

My 16-6 lead is MASSIVE. I need to keep expanding my territory while setting up future traps.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nWith all moves safe, I need to think long-term:\n- Going RIGHT to (8,8) brings me back to where I was last turn - that's playing safe but doesn't advance my position.\n- Going UP to (7,9) puts me in the top row corner. Good for perimeter control but might limit my movement next turn.\n- Going DOWN to (7,7) gets me an apple (+1 point!) and keeps me in the upper middle of the board where I have better flexibility.\n- Going LEFT to (6,8) gets me an apple (+1 point!) and moves me toward the center-left, getting closer to where the enemy is eventually.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI'm taking the DOWN move to (7,7) because:\n1. **Immediate apple gain** - I'm already dominating, let's keep stacking points\n2. **Board position** - From (7,7), I'll have better access to the central region where I can start cutting off the enemy's escape routes\n3. **Flexibility** - I'll still have 4 options next turn and won't be cornered\n\nNext few turns: Keep eating apples to grow, then start maneuvering to the left side to box in Snake #0. Once I hit 20+ apples and have position, I'll start the hunt.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nDOWN to (7,7) - apple grab + better board position for the eventual trap!\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m not chasing apples this turn; I\u2019m playing smart, avoiding risky flankers, and looking to keep options open.\n\nReasoning:\n- Safe options: UP (1,2) or RIGHT (2,1). Neither overlaps with our current body or the opponent\u2019s body right now.\n- We\u2019re behind 16 to 6. Head-on with the faster-growing enemy is a losing bet unless the board lines up perfectly for us, so I\u2019ll avoid a reckless collision.\n- Early spacing matters: keeping a couple escape routes helps us dodge any surprise maneuvers and ice the center open for a future pressure play.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:\n- Maintain multiple escape routes and keep away from the edges where the opponent can trap us.\n- Step toward the center gradually (pressing toward higher-traffic cells) to threaten the enemy without getting boxed in.\n- Avoid chasing apples aggressively this turn; focus on positioning and preventing a clean head-on from the opponent.\n- If the opportunity for a safe head-on arises with a favorable score tie or lead, take it, otherwise dodge and preserve the lead-in to turn 150.\n\nMOVE DECISION: UP\n\nUP",

The enemy is still stuck in the bottom-left corner with their tail stretched out, and I've got my whole body lined up perfectly for a killer maneuver. My head is at (5, 7) after that sweet apple pickup, and I'm ready to CRUSH!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**ANALYSIS FROM (5, 7):**\n- **UP to (5, 8):** Row 8 shows \". . . . . . . A T T A\" - column 5 is \".\" (empty)! SAFE! \u2705 But wait... row 8 is where my body ends! Let me check... Actually looking at the board, row 8 column 9 is \"A\" (apple), and row 7 column 5 is \"A\". From (5,7), going UP to (5,8) is actually empty space! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (5, 6):** Row 6 shows \". . . . A A A . T A\" - column 5 is \"A\" (apple)! SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (4, 7):** Row 7 shows \". . . . . A . 1 T A\" - column 4 is \".\" (empty)! But wait... my body is at (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1)... I don't see (4,7) in my body! SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Row 7 shows \". . . . . A . 1 T A\" - column 6 is \"1\" (MY OWN HEAD)! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**WAIT!** I made a mistake! My head is at (5,7) and my body includes (6,7) as the next segment. So moving RIGHT to (6,7) would be moving into my own body! That's definitely a death move. \n\n**CORRECTION:**\n- **UP to (5, 8):** Row 8 is empty in that spot! SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (5, 6):** Gets the apple! SAFE! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (4, 7):** Empty! SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Into my own body (next segment)! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI have THREE safe moves. Let me think about the trap I want to set:\n- **UP (5,8):** Moves me into the upper-middle zone, positioning me to cut off the enemy's escape routes upward. From there I can start boxing them in from above.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Gets an apple but moves me downward, staying in the middle of the board. Less aggressive positioning.\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Moves me left toward the left side of the board. This is actually moving AWAY from the enemy who is at (3,2)...\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nGoing **UP to (5,8)** because:\n1. **Apple potential** - I'm moving toward the apple cluster at the top (row 8 has apples at columns 6, 7, 8, 9)\n2. **Dominance positioning** - Getting to the upper-middle creates a wall that can prevent the enemy from escaping upward\n3. **Board control** - From (5,8) I'll have options to move left, right, or up to establish a barrier\n4. **Cutting off escape** - The enemy needs room to move. Taking the high ground cuts off their northern escape routes!\n\nThe enemy is at (3,2) with a long tail. They're trapped in the bottom-left corner. My goal is to build a horizontal wall across the upper-middle board to prevent them from ever getting to the apple-rich areas. Once I have that position, I can tighten the noose!\n\nFrom (5,8), next turn I'll be able to move left along the top row, building my wall. They'll be forced to move into my body or stay trapped!\n\nUP",

Keep options open and avoid predictable chasing.\n\nLong-term: Force mistakes, avoid risky head-ons unless parity shifts, and aim to squeeze the opponent into tighter spaces while we maintain a safe retreat path.\n\nSELECTED MOVE:\nUP",

Let's look at the board from (6,8) after last turn's RIGHT move.\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\nMy head is now at (6,8) from last turn's RIGHT move (I got the apple there, YEAH!). Let me see what moves are safe:\n- **UP to (6,9):** Row 9, column 6 is \".\" (empty)! SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (6,7):** Row 7, column 6 shows \"A\" (apple) but check my body... (6,7) is currently occupied by my own body (the segment moves as I move, but this is tricky). Actually looking at the board, (6,7) shows \"A\" which means apple. But if I go DOWN, my head would be moving into my own body that's currently there. That's a collision! NOT SAFE! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5,8):** Row 8, column 5 shows \"T\" (enemy tail?) Wait no, looking at my body list, (5,8) is my second segment, but it moves. Actually looking at the board state: Row 8 shows \". A . . . T 1 T T A\" so column 5 is \"T\" (my tail). But since my tail moves when I move, going LEFT back into where my neck was is moving backwards into my own body! That's a crash! NOT SAFE! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (7,8):** Row 8, column 7 shows \"T\" (my body). Wait, looking at board: Row 8 shows \"1 T T A\" starting at column 6? Let me re-read: \". A . . . T 1 T T A\" - that's columns 0-9. So column 7 is \"T\" (my body). But if I go RIGHT to (7,8), I'd be moving into my own body! NOT SAFE! \u274c\n\nWait, this seems bad! Let me re-examine the board state more carefully.\n\nLooking at the board visual again:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . . T 1 T T A\n 7 . . . . . T T T T A\n 6 . . . . A A A . T A\n 5 . . A . . A A . T .\n 4 . . . 0 . . . . T T\n 3 . . . T . A A T T T\n 2 . T T T T T T T T A\n 1 . T A . . . . . . .\n 0 T T . . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nSo row 8 (y=8): \n- col 1: A (apple)\n- col 5: T (my tail)\n- col 6: 1 (my head)\n- col 7: T (my body)\n- col 8: T (my body)\n- col 9: A (apple)\n\nMy head is at (6,8). My body goes through (5,8), (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,9): Row 9 col 6 is \".\" - empty! SAFE!\nIf I move DOWN to (6,7): Row 7 col 6 is \"T\" (my body)! NOT SAFE!\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8): Row 8 col 5 is \"T\" (my body, but moving backward)! NOT SAFE!\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8): Row 8 col 7 is \"T\" (my body)! NOT SAFE!\n\nOMG CHAT! Only UP is safe! The enemy is trapped in the bottom-left corner, but I might be boxing myself in too!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nUP to (6,9) is the ONLY safe move! Let me verify:\n- (6,9) is definitely empty (row 9 col 6 is \".\")\n- Not moving into my own body (my body is at y=8 or below)\n- Not moving into enemy (enemy is at y=4 or below)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm forced to go UP to stay alive. From (6,9) I'll have more options. The enemy snake #0 is still trapped at (3,4) with a long tail. They can only move DOWN or LEFT or maybe RIGHT but they'll crash soon. My goal is to survive and eventually close the trap. But right now, I need to not die!\n\nCHAT WE'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT BUT UP IS THE ONLY CHOICE! LET'S GO!\n\n**END CURRENT TURN STRATEGY**\n\nUP",

DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (6,8):** Row 8, col 6 shows \"T\" (my body)! That's moving into myself! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (5,9):** Row 9, col 5 shows \".\" (empty)! SAFE! \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (7,9):** Row 9, col 7 shows \".\" (empty)! SAFE! \u2705\n\nWAIT CHAT! I'm in a SERIOUSLY TIGHT SPOT! From (6,9), I have TWO safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT, but BOTH could lead to dead ends if I'm not careful. \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row 9 is mostly empty, but it's narrow\n- My body is stretched out below\n- The opponent is stuck in the bottom-left corner\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,9): I'll be near the center but might trap myself\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,9): I'll be closer to the right edge but have more maneuvering room\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI need to choose the move that gives me the MOST future options and keeps me away from the opponent. The opponent is at (3,4) - if I go RIGHT toward (7,9), I'm moving AWAY from them and toward the right side where there are still apples available (like (9,0), (8,2), (9,6), etc.). Going LEFT brings me closer to the center but also closer to where the opponent could potentially break out.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGo RIGHT to (7,9) to secure the right side of the board. This positions me to either sweep down along the right edge or cut across the top. I need to stay mobile and avoid getting boxed in by my own growing body. The opponent is weak - I just need to survive and pick them off when they're forced to move.\n\nLET'S GO RIGHT! EAT OR BE EATEN!\n\nRIGHT",

T 1 . .` - Actually, I'm at col 7 (the \"1\"), and col 6 has \"T\" (my body), col 8 and 9 are empty\n- So from (7,9), my immediate options are:\n  - **UP to (7,10):** OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n  - **DOWN to (7,8):** Row 8, col 7 - that's \"T\" (my body)! MOVING INTO MYSELF! DEAD! \u274c\n  - **LEFT to (6,9):** Row 9, col 6 - that's \"T\" (my body)! MOVING INTO MYSELF!

All other moves are instant death!\n\nThis is a CRITICAL MOMENT! I have NO CHOICE but to go RIGHT!\n\nBut wait... let me think ahead. If I go RIGHT to (8,9) next turn, where can I go from there?\n- From (8,9): UP = off board, DOWN = (8,8) which is \"T\" (my body), LEFT = (7,9) which I just came from, RIGHT = (9,9) which is empty.\n\nSo from (8,9) I could go RIGHT to (9,9) or potentially DOWN if I grow... but DOWN to (8,8) is my body. Wait, let me trace my body...\n\nActually, if I go to (8,9) and then (9,9), I might have more space. The opponent is way down at (3,6) so they're not an immediate threat. I need to survive and find space!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1. Go RIGHT to (8,9) - NO CHOICE\n2. From there, probably go RIGHT to (9,9) to get to the far right corner\n3.

Looking at the board state, I need to make a crucial decision!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom my head at (8,9):\n- **UP to (8,10):** OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (8,8):** Row 8, col 8 - that's \"T\" (my body)! MOVING INTO MYSELF! DEAD! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (7,9):** Row 9, col 7 - that's empty \".\" (I just came from there, but it's now empty because my tail moved) \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (9,9):** Row 9, col 9 - that's empty \".\" \u2705\n\nSo I have TWO safe moves: LEFT back to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nIf I go LEFT to (7,9):\n- I'll be back where I was last turn\n- From there, I can go DOWN to (7,8) or LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT back to (8,9)\n- This gives me some breathing room but I'm still in the top row\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,9):\n- I'll be in the far corner at (9,9)\n- From there, I can ONLY go DOWN to (9,8) or LEFT back to (8,9)\n- This is more restrictive but gets me toward potential apples!\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nLooking at the apples, I see (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,2) are all on the right side or bottom. If I go RIGHT to (9,9), I'm positioned to potentially grab (9,8) next turn if it's safe!\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT:**\nSnake #0 is at (3,7) - way down left corner. They're not an immediate threat but could be growing. With my 18 apples vs their 7, I have a MASSIVE lead! If I can force a head-on collision now, I WIN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI'm going to claim the right side! Move RIGHT to (9,9), then DOWN to (9,8) to eat that apple if possible, then work my way down the right edge. The opponent is trapped in the left corner - I can dominate the right side and box them in!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is sprawling up in the top-right region with head at (8,9). You\u2019re down on apples 7 to 18, but survival and space control come first in this phase.\n\nSAFE OPTIONS NOW: UP to (3,8), LEFT to (2,7), RIGHT to (4,7).

It preserves both escape routes and lets you pivot toward angles that can pressure him without taking unnecessary risks.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Hold breadth in the central zones, monitor his moves along the top edge, and look for opportunistic slips toward the left or right that could nudge him into a tighter space. Avoid rushing into a head-on with a much longer snake unless you have a clear, advantageous setup.\n\nMOVE PLAN FOR THIS TURN: \n\nUP",

DEAD! \u274c\n- **DOWN to (9,8):** That's an apple! \u2705 AND it's empty except for the apple itself.\n- **LEFT to (8,9):** That's my body (T)! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,9):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n\nWAIT CHAT! I need to be SUPER careful here. From my current position at (9,9), I can only move DOWN to (9,8) because the other three directions are either off-board or into my own body!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nSince I'm TRAPPED in the corner with only ONE safe move, I MUST take it. Moving DOWN to (9,8) will:\n1. **GROW ME** - I'll eat the apple at (9,8) and get my 19th apple!\n2. **SET UP POSITIONING** - From (9,8) I'll have more options (LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7) or RIGHT back to (9,9))\n3. **DOMINATE THE RIGHT SIDE** - I'm claiming this territory and boxing out the opponent who's stuck on the left!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nThe opponent is at (3,8) - they're nowhere near me. Even if they move RIGHT repeatedly, it'll take them forever to reach my side. I have a MASSIVE 18-7 apple lead. If I can force a head-on collision later when I'm even bigger, I WIN.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating (9,8), I'll work my way down the right edge eating (9,7) and (9,6). This creates a wall that traps the opponent in the left half of the board. With my size advantage, if they try to challenge me head-on, they LOSE. I'll keep growing and dominating until I reach 30 or until they crash into me!\n\nI literally have no choice here - DOWN is the ONLY safe move. Let's GOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 43 and the game is RAGING! Let's look at the board from my new position at (9,8) after eating that apple.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT FROM (9,8):**\n- **UP to (9,9):** That's where I came from, but now my tail will move. After I move, the cell (9,9) will be empty except for my tail that's moving off it. SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (9,7):** There's an apple here at (9,7)! Looking at the board state, I can see 'A' at position (9,7). This is SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (8,8):** That's my body! DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10,8):** OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n\nWAIT CHAT! Let me double-check that UP move. My body list shows my tail is at (7,3), and the cell directly behind my head at (9,8) is... actually looking at my body list, I need to be careful. My head is at (9,8), my body goes (9,9), (8,9), (7,9)... so the cell behind me is (9,9) which is currently occupied by my body. But when I move, my tail will move away. Let me think: if I move UP to (9,9), that's currently my body segment, but that segment will shift. Actually, moving UP would mean I'm moving into where my second body segment currently is - that's moving backwards into myself! That's a crash! \u274c\n\nSo from (9,8), my only SAFE moves are:\n- DOWN to (9,7) - there's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT to (8,8) - that's my body! \ud83d\udc80\n- UP to (9,9) - that's moving into my own body (backwards)! \ud83d\udc80\n- RIGHT to (10,8) - off board! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI'm back in a corner trap at (9,8)! Similar to last turn, I'm cornered. But this time I have TWO potential moves (wait, let me re-examine).\n\nActually, looking at my body list: Head (9,8), Body: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3)]\n\nThe cell behind me (the way I came from) is (9,9). That's currently occupied by my body. Moving UP to (9,9) would be moving into my own body - that's a crash! So UP is out.\n\nThe cell in front of me (DOWN) is (9,7). Looking at the board, position (9,7) shows 'A' - an apple! And there's no snake body there. So DOWN is safe and gives me an apple!\n\nLEFT is (8,8) - that's also in my body list! That's a crash!\n\nRIGHT is off board!\n\nSo I literally only have ONE safe move: DOWN to (9,7) to eat that apple!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nAfter eating (9,7), I'll be at (9,7) with my tail at (9,8). The opponent is still on the left side at (3,9). They can't reach me. I'm growing to 20 apples! My score is 19-7. With a 12-point lead, if I can force a head-on collision later, I WIN. I need to work my way down the right edge and create a wall. Once I eat (9,7), I'll have access to (9,6) next turn which also has an apple!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nThe opponent is at (3,9) - they're stuck in the upper-left. They could try to move right, but it'll take them forever to reach me. I have a MASSIVE lead. If they want to challenge me, they'll die. I just need to keep growing and not die!\n\n**DEFENSIVE PLAY:**\nSince I'm cornered with only one safe move, I'll take it. This is about survival and growth. I'm boxing the opponent out of the right side. Once I clear the corner, I'll have more maneuvering room.\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! DOWN to (9,7) for the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Your head is around (3,8) with a solid neck, opponent\u2019s head is blazing at (9,8) with a long coil up in the top-right, and you\u2019re sitting at 7 apples to their 19. The space near the top edge is precious, and we wanna bully him into mistakes while not getting boxed in ourselves.\n\nSafe move options (current state could vary slightly, but you\u2019re not about to die this turn):\n- UP to (3,9) \u2014 safe, puts you on the top edge and keeps options open.\n- LEFT to (2,8) \u2014 safe, keeps youCenter-ish with top access.\n- RIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 safe, maintains pressure without steering into a trap.\n- DOWN would crash into your own neck, so that\u2019s a no.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning UP:\n- It front-loads pressure on the top corridor, giving you multi-angle angles to threaten and react.\n- It preserves escape routes and avoids locking you into a corner too early.\n- It keeps you in the fight for space while you start to influence the top-right dynamic through future turns.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Hold the top-center corridor and monitor his top-row behavior. If he tries to swing toward the middle, you can mirror and pin him between your body and the wall.\n- Don\u2019t chase apples blindly\u2014your priority is board control and forcing mistakes, then opportunistically grab safe apples when they open up.\n\nLonger-term note:\n- If you can coax him into a multi-turn squeeze between your advancing top-edge line and the wall, you can convert space into a head-on pressure opportunity. Respect that head-on wins only if you\u2019re positioned to force a collision, which isn\u2019t guaranteed right now, so don\u2019t overextend.\n- Keep an eye on potential flank routes to swing him toward the left side of the board while your top lane shuts him in.\n\nMove for this turn: UP\n\nUP",
