RIGHT to (1, 3): Safe.\n\nAll safe moves are towards the center of the board, which is where the apples are located.\n\nLet's analyze apple proximity:\nThe closest apples are (2, 6) and (6, 2).\nDistance to (2, 6): $|2-0| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5$ steps.\nDistance to (6, 2): $|6-0| + |2-3| = 6 + 1 = 7$ steps.\n\nApple (2, 6) seems like the best target, requiring moving generally UP and RIGHT.\n\nAnalyzing safe moves for turn 1:\n- Move UP to (0, 4): This moves me towards (2, 6).\n- Move DOWN to (0, 2): This moves me slightly towards (6, 2), but generally away from the cluster of apples.\n- Move RIGHT to (1, 3): This moves me towards (2, 6) and towards the center, potentially creating a conflict with Snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (6, 3). Snake 1 might move:\n1. UP to (6, 4): Towards (6, 9) or (4, 8) or (9, 6).\n2. DOWN to (6, 2): Directly onto an apple (6, 2). Very likely move.\n3. LEFT to (5, 3): Towards me, but unlikely to collide immediately unless I move RIGHT.\n4. RIGHT to (7, 3): Away from most apples, unless targeting the right edge.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (6, 2), they grab the apple. This is 1 move away for them.\nIf I target (2, 6), I need 5 moves (e.g., R, R, U, U, U).\n\nI should aim to secure an apple as quickly as possible without risking a collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 3):\n- I am 2 moves from X=2, and 3 moves from Y=6.\n- Snake 1 is far away, a collision is not immediate.\n- This is a good path towards (2, 6).\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 4):\n- I maintain safety along the wall, 1 move closer to Y=6.\n- I am still far from X=2.\n\nSince speed and distance are calculated using Manhattan distance, moving across the X-axis (RIGHT) and Y-axis (UP) equally helps toward (2, 6).\n\n(0, 3) -> (1, 3) RIGHT: Distance to (2, 6) is $1+3=4$.\n(0, 3) -> (0, 4) UP: Distance to (2, 6) is $2+2=4$.\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP reduce the distance to (2, 6) by 1.\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 4), I stay along the left edge, which provides maximum space and safety from Snake 1 who is on the right side of the board. My movement path (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6) looks safer than moving RIGHT immediately and potentially getting into the central area where Snake 1 might move later.\n\nLet's stick to the perimeter for now to maximize space and separation from Snake 1, if distance to the target apple (2, 6) is the same.\n\nPlan: Stick to the left boundary and move UP towards the apple at (2, 6).\n\nMove 1: UP to (0, 4).\nNext moves: R, R, U, U.\n\nSnake 1 is likely to move DOWN to (6, 2) and score immediately. If they do, only 4 apples remain.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

Snake 1 must have moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2) and eaten an apple, as their score is now 1. The apple previously at (6, 2) is gone, and their body is now [(6, 3)]. *Correction: looking at the input, Snake 1's head is (6, 2) and body is (6, 3). Since they start as 2 segments long and have 1 apple, they must have eaten an apple on Turn 0's move.* The board representation confirms this: '1' at (6, 2) and 'T' (Tail/Body) at (6, 3).\n\nThe remaining apples are: A1 (4, 8), A2 (2, 6), A3 (9, 6), A4 (6, 9), A5 (3, 7).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (Head at (0, 4)):\n1. UP to (0, 5): Safe. On the perimeter.\n2. DOWN to (0, 3): Safe. Reversing movement path, but still safe.\n3. LEFT to (-1, 4): Outside boundary. DEATH.\n4. RIGHT to (1, 4): Safe.

They are far away. However, they are likely targeting A3 (9, 6) or A4 (6, 9) or moving towards the center (3, 7).\n\nIf Snake 1 moves:\n- UP to (6, 3): Head-to-Tail collision risk. Snake 1 moves onto its old body segment/tail. If it hasn't eaten, this is a normal move where the tail moves. If it *did* eat, the tail stays, and this is death. Since they just ate (score 1, length 2), their tail stays at (6, 3). Moving UP means death for them.\n- RIGHT to (7, 2): Safe, moving towards A3 (9, 6).\n- LEFT to (5, 2): Safe, moving towards A5 (3, 7).\n- DOWN to (6, 1): Safe, moving away from most apples.\n\nThe most likely smart moves for Snake 1 are RIGHT (7, 2) or LEFT (5, 2), targeting the large cluster of apples in the upper half of the board.\n\nMy strategy of sticking to the perimeter (moving UP) remains safe and efficient, as it maintains maximum separation from Snake 1 and preserves movement space.\n\n1.

Move RIGHT to (2, 4) -> D=2.\n3. Move UP to (2, 5) -> D=1.\n4. Move UP to (2, 6) -> EAT. (4 turns)\n\nBoth paths take 4 turns. Moving UP keeps me along the wall. I prioritize UP to maintain boundary safety, although both are equally good for distance.\n\nFuture Plan: Get A2 (2, 6) via 0, 5 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 5 -> 2, 6.\nCurrent move: UP.\n\nUP",

Any move S1 makes will maintain a large distance.\nSafe moves for S1: UP (6, 1) is blocked by its body/tail (since it ate on T=1, the tail stays at (6, 1)). S1 must move DOWN (6, -1: DEATH), LEFT (5, 0), or RIGHT (7, 0).\nS1 will likely move towards the nearest apples, which are A3 (9, 6) or potentially A5 (3, 7).\n- If S1 moves LEFT to (5, 0): Distance to A5 (3, 7) is 9. Distance to A3 (9, 6) is 10.\n- If S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 0): Distance to A5 (3, 7) is 11. Distance to A3 (9, 6) is 8.\nS1 is highly likely to move RIGHT to (7, 0) to pursue A3 (9, 6).\n\nThere is zero collision risk with S1 this turn regardless of my move.\n\nComparing UP (1, 6) and RIGHT (2, 5):\n\nIf I choose UP (1, 6):\nNext turn (T=4): RIGHT to (2, 6) [EAT].

(7, 0) is 10 moves away from (2, 6).\nS1 is likely moving towards A3 (9, 6) or perhaps A4 (6, 9).\nIf S1 moves:\n- UP to (7, 1): Safest, moving up the board towards A3/A4.\n- DOWN to (7, -1): DEATH. (Off-board)\n- LEFT to (6, 0): Blocked by its body/tail (since it ate on T=2, the tail is currently (6, 0)). Moving onto the tail is only safe if it grows, but since it ate last turn, the tail position is protected. The tail will move from (6, 0) to (7, 0) if it doesn't eat, or stay at (6, 0) if it does eat. Since it didn't eat last turn (T=3), its tail moved from (6, 1) to (6, 0). If it moves LEFT to (6, 0), it runs into its own body segment. This move is deadly.\n*Correction on S1's body rules: S1's body is [(6, 0)]. S1 T=3 head: (7, 0). S1 T=2 head: (6, 0). S1 T=1 head: (6, 1)? Wait, S1's last reported state was T=3: Head: (7, 0), Body: [(6, 0)]. If S1 moves LEFT to (6, 0), it hits its body.\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): Safe. This might be a good setup for A3 (9, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves UP (7, 1) or RIGHT (8, 0), there is no collision risk with my snake (0), which is moving to (2, 6).\n\nTherefore, the move UP is safe and achieves the primary goal of eating the apple A2.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nGoal A2 (2, 6) is achieved this turn.\nAfter eating A2, my snake will be at (2, 6) with length 2 and body [(2, 5)].\nNew nearby apples: A5 (3, 7) and A1 (4, 8).\nDistance from (2, 6) to A5 (3, 7): 1 + 1 = 2.\nDistance from (2, 6) to A1 (4, 8): 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nThe next target will be A5 (3, 7).\nT=5 plan: Move RIGHT to (3, 6).

But since I ate the apple at (2, 6), my body should be [(2, 5)] and it should not vanish next turn. The provided input Snake 0 body list is [(2, 5)]. Since I ate, the tail stays, so the occupied cells are (2, 6) Head, and (2, 5) Body/Tail. So, the board markers 0 (Head) at (2, 6) and T (Tail/Body) at (2, 5) are correct for T=5 START state.*\n\nMy current head is (2, 6).\nNext target: A4 (3, 7).\nDistance (Manhattan) from (2, 6) to (3, 7): $|3-2| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nLet's evaluate the current move options for Snake 0 (Head at (2, 6)):\n\n1.

If I move here, I hit my own body. DEATH.\n3.  LEFT to (1, 6): Safe. Distance to A4 (3, 7): 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away.\n4.  RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe. Distance to A4 (3, 7): 1. This aligns with A4.\n\nSafe moves: UP (2, 7), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6).\n\nComparing safe moves based on distance to A4 (3, 7):\n*   UP (2, 7): Distance 1. (Next turn move RIGHT to eat A4).\n*   RIGHT (3, 6): Distance 1. (Next turn move UP to eat A4).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT set me up to eat A4 in 2 turns.\n\nLet's check A1 (4, 8) as an alternative:\nDistance from (2, 6) to (4, 8): 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nS1 analysis: Head at (7, 1), Body at (7, 0). S1 is likely heading towards A2 (9, 6) or A3 (6, 9) or A5 (9, 9).\nPossible moves for S1:\n1.  UP to (7, 2): Safe. Moves towards center/top.\n2.  DOWN to (7, 0): *DANGER!* S1's body/tail is at (7, 0) and will not move this turn since S1 did not eat last turn. S1's body at T=4 was [(7, 0)]. S1 T=5 head is (7, 1). If S1 did not eat previously (T=4), its tail vanishes. However, the update implies S1's current state is Head (7, 1), Body [(7, 0)]. This means S1 must have moved UP from (7, 0) to (7, 1) and *did not eat*, so the body moved from [(6, 0)] (T=3 end state) to [(7, 0)] (T=4 end state). If S1 moves DOWN, it hits its body at (7, 0). DEATH.\n    *Self-Correction on S1 body movement:* If S1 Head moves from H_old=(7, 0) to H_new=(7, 1) and *no apple is eaten*, then S1 Body B_old=[(6, 0)] becomes B_new=[(7, 0)]. The tail position (6, 0) vanishes and (7, 0) becomes the new tail. So, (7, 0) is occupied by S1's body. Moving DOWN to (7, 0) is self-collision.\n3.  LEFT to (6, 1): Safe. Moves towards A3 (6, 9).\n4.  RIGHT to (8, 1): Safe. Moves towards A2 (9, 6) or A5 (9, 9).\n\nThere is no immediate collision risk with S1, regardless of my move (UP or RIGHT). S1 is far away.\n\nI should choose the path that offers better future coverage or slightly safer alignment.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 7):\nT=6: Move RIGHT to (3, 7) [EAT A4]. New state (3, 7), body [(2, 7), (2, 6)].\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 6):\nT=6: Move UP to (3, 7) [EAT A4]. New state (3, 7), body [(3, 6), (2, 6)].\n\nBoth options are equally effective for reaching A4 quickly.\n\nLet's look ahead to A1 (4, 8).\nIf I choose UP (2, 7): I\u2019m already slightly higher, closer to A1 (4, 8).\nIf I choose RIGHT (3, 6): I\u2019m already slightly further right, closer to A1 (4, 8).\n\nFrom (3, 7) (after eating A4):\nTo A1 (4, 8): 1 + 1 = 2 steps. E.g., RIGHT to (4, 7), then UP to (4, 8) [EAT]. This is the same regardless of whether I reached (3, 7) via (2, 7) or (3, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 6):\nPros: I create a path parallel to the 6th rank, which is clear. This might feel slightly more flexible than going high immediately, although (2, 7) is also wide open.\n\nLet's stick to the plan laid out earlier: Move RIGHT to (3, 6) and then UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Check:**\nT=5: Move RIGHT to (3, 6). New Head (3, 6), Body [(2, 6), (2, 5)].\nT=6: Move UP to (3, 7) [EAT A4]. Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5)].\nT=7: Move RIGHT to (4, 7).\nT=8: Move UP to (4, 8) [EAT A1].\n\nThis seems robust.\n\nFinal check on collision risks:\nSnake 0 moves to (3, 6).\nSnake 1 moves to (7, 2), (6, 1), or (8, 1). No intersection.\n\nRIGHT is the chosen move.\n\nRIGHT",

This suggests either:\na) The input description for T=6 is incorrect regarding the length/body segments, OR\nb) I did not eat on T=5, and the score increment happened earlier, OR\nc) I *did* eat on T=5, and the game system handles subsequent turns such that the body list reflects the length after growth, but the provided list `[(2, 6)]` still suggests length 2.\n\nGiven the constraints, I must trust the provided state: Head (3, 6), Body [(2, 6)]. Total length is 2. (This implicitly contradicts the score increase AND the common snake rule that if you eat, your tail segment does not vanish, increasing length by 1).\n*Assumption:* I must assume the current occupied cells are (3, 6) Head, and (2, 6) Tail/Body. Total length 2. Since I *just* ate (Score 1 -> 1, maybe the +1 was T=5, but score was already 1 before T=5 move, and I ate an *enemy* apple or something weird?), I will assume that the tail will **not** vanish this turn, making my next move a non-shrinking move. Even if the tail vanishes, it vanishes from (2, 6).\n\nWait, the inputs state:\nScores so far: Your apple score: 1.\nMy snake (ID: 0): Head: (3, 6), Body: [(2, 6)], Apples collected: 1.\nThis confirms length 2.\n\nLet's look at the location of the enemy snake (S1): Head (7, 0), Body [(7, 1)]. (Wait, the body list is head-to-tail, so S1 head is (7, 0) and the segment behind is (7, 1)). This is unusual as coordinates are usually ordered head-to-tail, meaning the coordinate list is H, B1, B2, ..., T. If H=(7, 0), B1=(7, 1) means S1's body stretches *up* from its head. But typically B1 must be adjacent to H. Let's look at the board state:\n 1 . . . . . . . T . .\n 0 . . . . . . . 1 . .\n'1' is at (7, 0) (Head). 'T' is at (7, 1) (Tail/Body). This confirms the standard convention of coordinates: (7, 0) is the head, (7, 1) is the body segment immediately behind it.\n\n**Target Apple (A4):** (3, 7). Distance: $|3-3| + |7-6| = 1$. It is directly UP.\n\n**Safe Moves Evaluation from (3, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7) [EAT A4]:**\n    *   Target is A4. Success leads to score +1, length +1.\n    *   Safe: No collision with walls, my body, or S1's body/head.\n    *   This is the optimal move: capture an apple.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from the immediate target. Keep as backup.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):**\n    *   *DANGER!* This is my body/tail. Since the body list is [(2, 6)], moving here means self-collision. DEATH. Even if the tail were to disappear (if I hadn't eaten previously), the segment (2, 6) holds the snake body until the move is executed.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from A4 (distance to A4 is 1 + 1 = 2).\n\n**Chosen Move:** UP (3, 7). This eats A4.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on):**\nMy move: UP to (3, 7).\nS1 Head (7, 0). S1 is very far away. No risk of collision.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=7 onwards):**\nAfter eating A4 at (3, 7), my new state will be Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 6), (2, 6)].\n\nNext targets:\nA1 (4, 8): Dist from (3, 7) = 1 + 1 = 2.\nA3 (6, 9): Dist from (3, 7) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nPlan:\nT=7: Move towards A1 (4, 8). Either RIGHT to (4, 7) or UP to (3, 8).\nIf UP to (3, 8), then T=8 RIGHT to (4, 8) [EAT A1]. If RIGHT to (4, 7), then T=8 UP to (4, 8) [EAT A1]. Both are 2 turns.\n\nLet's prioritize going UP first, as it keeps me more central for A3 (6, 9) afterwards if A1 is contested or missed.\n\nT=7: Move UP to (3, 8). Set up for A1.\nT=8: Move RIGHT to (4, 8) [EAT A1].\nT=9: Move towards A3 (6, 9).\n\nThis looks like a solid sequence to gain two more apples rapidly.\n\nUP",

Length 2. Apples collected: 1.\n\nApples remaining: (4, 8), (9, 6), (6, 9), (9, 9), (9, 4).\n\n**Goal:** Safely eat the nearest apple, (4, 8).\n\nCurrent position: (3, 7).\nTarget (A1): (4, 8). Euclidean distance is 1.41. Manhattan distance is $1+1=2$.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (3, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 8):**\n    *   Safe: (3, 8) is empty and on board.\n    *   Movement towards A1 (4, 8): Future move RIGHT from (3, 8) lands on A1.

DO NOT MOVE DOWN.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   Safe: (2, 7) is empty and on board.\n    *   Movement: This moves further away from A1 (1 + 2 = 3 steps away).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Safe: (4, 7) is empty and on board.\n    *   Movement towards A1 (4, 8): Future move UP from (4, 7) lands on A1. This is also a good setup move.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\nBoth UP to (3, 8) and RIGHT to (4, 7) set me up to eat A1 (4, 8) on Turn 8.\n\n*   If I move UP to (3, 8): Next move is RIGHT to (4, 8) [EAT A1].\n*   If I move RIGHT to (4, 7): Next move is UP to (4, 8) [EAT A1].\n\nThe overall vicinity of (3, 7) is relatively open. S1 is extremely far away at (6, 0). There is no immediate risk of collision with S1.\n\nI choose UP to (3, 8). This keeps me slightly further away from the center of the board's width, possibly making it easier to navigate towards A3 (6, 9) or A5 (9, 9) afterward, although the difference is minor.\n\nLet's maintain the planned sequence:\nT=7: UP to (3, 8).\nT=8: RIGHT to (4, 8) [EAT A1].\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Prediction:** S1 is at (6, 0), and its body is (7, 0). S1 is looking for apples. The closest apples to S1 seem to be A5 (9, 4) or A2 (9, 6).\nS1 is likely to move RIGHT to (7, 0) (This is an immediate kill move if the body list order meant (7, 0) was the body segment, but since H=(6, 0) and B1=(7, 0), S1 is likely to move UP to (6, 1) or LEFT to (5, 0) to avoid running into (7, 0) which is its tail/body *unless* the tail vanishes, which it won't since S1 didn't just eat).\nWait, the order of S1's body is Head (6, 0), Body [(7, 0)]. This means segment (7, 0) is immediately behind the head (6, 0). This is only possible if S1 moved LEFT from (7, 0) to (6, 0) on the previous turn.\n*Correction on S1 body list interpretation:* If coordinates are ordered Head-to-Tail, and S1 is at (6, 0), Body [(7, 0)]. (7, 0) *must* be adjacent to (6, 0). Yes, it is. But if S1 moved LEFT from (7, 0) to (6, 0), its previous body segment must have been (7, 0) or (7, 1) etc.\nLet's assume the map visualization is correct: 1 at (6, 0), T at (7, 0).\nS1 likely cannot move RIGHT (into its own body (7, 0)).\nS1 safe moves: UP to (6, 1), LEFT to (5, 0), DOWN to (6, -1) [Wall].\nS1 will likely move UP towards the board center if it wants high apples, or LEFT/UP if it wants A5 (9, 4). Given the distance, S1's movement doesn't affect my immediate move to A1 (4, 8).\n\nFinal decision remains UP to set up for A1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=8 onwards):**\nT=8: Move RIGHT to (4, 8) [EAT A1]. New Head (4, 8), Body [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)].\nT=9: Determine path to A3 (6, 9). From (4, 8), distance to (6, 9) is 2 + 1 = 3. Possible moves: UP to (4, 9), then RIGHT twice. Or RIGHT to (5, 8), UP/RIGHT/UP.\n\nI will stick with UP.\nUP",
