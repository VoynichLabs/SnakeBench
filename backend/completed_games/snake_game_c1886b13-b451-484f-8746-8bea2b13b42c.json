The enemy can reach (6, 5) in 2 steps by moving LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT. Moving to (6, 6) is a valid and potentially good move for the enemy to get closer to the apple at (6, 5).\n- If I move LEFT to (5, 7), I am further away from the enemy. This square is not a direct target for the enemy trying to reach (6, 5). This seems safe.\n- If I move RIGHT to (7, 7), I move adjacent to the enemy's starting column.

Moving LEFT to (5, 7) is the safest option this turn. While it means likely conceding the apple at (6, 5) to the enemy, it allows me to survive and compete for other apples, such as (0, 8) which becomes the closest apple from (5, 7).\n\nStrategy next turn: If I move LEFT to (5, 7), I will re-evaluate the board state. The apple at (0, 8) will likely be my primary target. I will plan a safe route towards (0, 8) while monitoring the enemy's movements.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

All these squares are within bounds and not currently occupied by my body (except the tail, which becomes free space, but (6,7) is not my tail) or the enemy snake.\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current head position (5, 7):\n- (6, 5): Manhattan distance = |5-6| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps.\n- (0, 8): Manhattan distance = |5-0| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6 steps.\n- (5, 0): Manhattan distance = |5-5| + |7-0| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n- (6, 0): Manhattan distance = |5-6| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8 steps.\n- (2, 2): Manhattan distance = |5-2| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 5).\nEnemy Snake 1 is at (7, 5).\nPossible moves for Enemy 1 from (7, 5):\n- UP: (7, 6) - Occupied by Enemy 1's body. Invalid.\n- DOWN: (7, 4) - Safe.\n- LEFT: (6, 5) - Safe and an apple!\n- RIGHT: (8, 5) - Safe.\n\nEnemy 1 can reach the apple at (6, 5) in 1 step by moving LEFT. My closest path to (6, 5) requires at least 3 steps. It is highly likely that Enemy 1 will reach and consume the apple at (6, 5) this turn. Therefore, targeting (6, 5) is not a good strategy for me this turn.\n\nLet's look at the next closest apple, which is at (0, 8), 6 steps away.\nHow do my valid moves affect my distance to (0, 8)?\n- Move UP to (5, 8): New distance = |5-0| + |8-8| = 5 + 0 = 5 steps. (Closer)\n- Move DOWN to (5, 6): New distance = |5-0| + |6-8| = 5 + 2 = 7 steps. (Further)\n- Move LEFT to (4, 7): New distance = |4-0| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps. (Closer)\n\nBoth UP and LEFT moves take me one step closer to the apple at (0, 8).\n\nNow consider safety regarding Enemy 1. Enemy 1's possible moves are (7, 4), (6, 5), (8, 5).\n- If I move UP to (5, 8), I do not collide with any of Enemy 1's potential positions.\n- If I move DOWN to (5, 6), I do not collide with any of Enemy 1's potential positions.\n- If I move LEFT to (4, 7), I do not collide with any of Enemy 1's potential positions.\n\nAll valid moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) appear safe from collision with Enemy 1 this turn.\n\nSince I cannot reach the closest apple at (6, 5) before the enemy likely does, my best strategy is to head towards the next closest apple, (0, 8), while maintaining safety.\nBoth UP and LEFT move me closer to (0, 8). Moving LEFT to (4, 7) positions me well to continue moving LEFT towards x=0, which is necessary to reach (0, 8). Moving UP to (5, 8) also moves me closer to y=8, but I would still need to make significant LEFT moves afterwards.\nMoving LEFT also puts more distance between me and the immediate vicinity of Enemy 1.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT seems like a good choice. It's safe and makes progress towards the most likely obtainable apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue path towards the apple at (0, 8) or reassess based on enemy movement and new apple spawns.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

From there, I would likely move LEFT multiple times.\nMoving LEFT to (3, 7) reduces my x-coordinate, getting me closer to the target's x-coordinate. From there, I would likely move LEFT multiple times and then UP.\n\nBased on the previous turn's rationale which favored moving LEFT to increase distance from the enemy (although both moves are safe), and with both UP and LEFT being optimal in terms of distance reduction to the closest apple, I will choose to continue moving LEFT. This aligns with the previous turn's strategy of heading towards (0, 8) by decreasing my x-coordinate.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue path towards the apple at (0, 8) by moving LEFT, or reassess based on new state.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

Notice there is an apple at (0, 8).\nEnemy Snake 1 is at Head (6, 2) with body segments at [(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)].\n\nMy current head position is (2, 8).\nPossible moves from (2, 8):\n- UP: (2, 9) - Valid and within bounds.\n- DOWN: (2, 7) - This square is currently occupied by my body segment (2, 7). This is not my tail, so this move is invalid.\n- LEFT: (1, 8) - Valid and within bounds.\n- RIGHT: (3, 8) - Valid and within bounds.\n\nValid moves are UP (2, 9), LEFT (1, 8), and RIGHT (3, 8). All these squares are within bounds and not occupied by any part of a snake (considering my tail will move).\n\nLet's find the closest apples from my current head position (2, 8):\n- (0, 8): Manhattan distance = |2-0| + |8-8| = 2 + 0 = 2 steps. This apple is very close!\n- (2, 2): Manhattan distance = |2-2| + |8-2| = 0 + 6 = 6 steps.\n- (8, 1): Manhattan distance = |2-8| + |8-1| = 6 + 7 = 13 steps.\n- (5, 0): Manhattan distance = |2-5| + |8-0| = 3 + 8 = 11 steps.\n- (6, 0): Manhattan distance = |2-6| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12 steps.\n\nThe closest apple is at (0, 8), just 2 steps away. This is clearly my target.\n\nHow do my valid moves affect my distance to (0, 8)?\n- Move UP to (2, 9): New distance = |2-0| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. (Further)\n- Move LEFT to (1, 8): New distance = |1-0| + |8-8| = 1 + 0 = 1 step. (Closer)\n- Move RIGHT to (3, 8): New distance = |3-0| + |8-8| = 3 + 0 = 3 steps. (Further)\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 8) takes me one step closer to the apple at (0, 8). From (1, 8), the next move LEFT would land me on the apple at (0, 8).\n\nEnemy Snake 1 is at (6, 2). It is far from the apple at (0, 8) and not a threat to reach it before me. My valid moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) do not put me in immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nThe safest and most direct move towards the closest apple is LEFT to (1, 8). This is a valid and empty square.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue path towards the apple at (0, 8). A LEFT move will put me right next to it, allowing me to eat it on the subsequent turn with another LEFT move. After eating, my tail will temporarily stay put, and I'll need to assess the new closest apple and any potential hazards with the new body layout.\n\nNext Move: LEFT"

I should prioritize moving towards an apple while avoiding collisions with walls, my own body, or the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apples: (2, 2), (8, 1), (3, 3), (8, 6), (1, 4).\nMy current position is (4, 7).\nThe nearest apples based on Manhattan distance are (3, 3) (distance 5) and (8, 6) (distance 5).\n\nLet's evaluate how each valid move affects my position relative to these apples:\n- Moving UP to (4, 8): Distance to (3, 3) increases, distance to (8, 6) increases.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 6): Distance to (3, 3) decreases, distance to (8, 6) decreases.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 7): Distance to (3, 3) increases, distance to (8, 6) decreases.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) decreases the distance to both of the currently closest apples. It also positions me lower on the board, which is beneficial as many apples are in the lower half.\n\nSafety check:\n- All valid moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) lead to empty squares that are not occupied by my body or the enemy snake's head or body in this turn.\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 3) and moving towards (3, 3) is a likely move for them (to eat an apple). My possible moves (4,8), (4,6), (5,7) are far enough from the enemy's current and likely next position to be safe this turn.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 6) is the best strategic move among the valid options as it brings me closer to multiple nearby apples without posing any immediate safety risk.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to re-assess the board from (4, 6), determine the new closest safe apple(s), and plan my path accordingly, always keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement and potential collisions.\n\nNext Move: DOWN"

My body segments are at [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)].\nThe apples are located at (8, 1), (8, 6), (1, 4), (8, 9), and (6, 1).\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (0, 3) with body segments at [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)].\n\nLet's check the possible moves from my current head position (3, 4):\n- **UP** to (3, 5): This cell is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body [(4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head (0,3) or body [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)]. This is a valid move to empty space.\n- **DOWN** to (3, 3): This cell is within bounds. It is occupied by the enemy snake's body at (3, 3). Moving here would cause a collision. This is an invalid move.\n- **LEFT** to (2, 4): This cell is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by the enemy snake's head or body. This is a valid move to empty space.\n- **RIGHT** to (4, 4): This cell is within bounds. It is occupied by my neck at (4, 4). Moving here would cause a collision. This is an invalid move.\n\nMy valid moves are UP to (3, 5) and LEFT to (2, 4). Neither of these moves lands on an apple in this turn.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 4), which is 2 moves away (|3-1| + |4-4| = 2).\n- Moving UP to (3, 5) would result in a distance of |3-1| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 to the apple at (1, 4).\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 4) would result in a distance of |2-1| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1 to the apple at (1, 4).\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 4) brings me closer to the nearest apple at (1, 4). It is a safe move as per the current board state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving LEFT, my head will be at (2, 4). My body will be [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6)]. The closest apple will still likely be at (1, 4). I will evaluate moves from (2, 4), primarily looking towards LEFT to (1, 4) if it is safe and available, to eat the apple at (1, 4). I will need to re-evaluate the entire board state, including the enemy snake's new position and any potential new apple spawns, prioritizing safety before heading towards the nearest apple.\n\nLEFT\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

          "rationale": "I'll start by visualizing our current board and goals. Our snake (ID 1) is on a 10\u00d710 board with its head at (0,3) and body at [(0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]. There are several apples on the board, but the one at (1,4) is closest: its Manhattan distance from our head is |1\u20130| + |4\u20133| = 1 + 1 = 2. That apple is our best immediate target.\n\nFrom our head at (0,3), our possible moves (without self-collision or running into walls) are:\n\u2003\u2022 UP to (0,4)\n\u2003\u2022 RIGHT to (1,3)\n\u2003\u2022 DOWN to (0,2) \u2013 but that\u2019s part of our body.\n\u2003\u2022 LEFT is off the board.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT eventually get us closer to the apple at (1,4). However, if we move RIGHT to (1,3), on our next move we can go directly UP to eat the apple at (1,4). In contrast, if we go UP, we\u2019d still need to move RIGHT afterward. Also, (1,3) is free (it isn\u2019t occupied by our body or the enemy snake, whose head is at (3,4) with its own body further away).\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is a direct step toward our target, minimizing delay to securing the apple. My strategy is:\n\u20031. Move RIGHT from (0,3) to (1,3).\n\u20032. Then next turn, plan to move UP into (1,4) to pick up the apple and grow.\n\nNo immediate dangers (walls, our own body, enemy snake) block that move.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT."
