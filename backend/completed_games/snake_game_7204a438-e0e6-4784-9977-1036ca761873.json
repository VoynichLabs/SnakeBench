My Body is (6, 4). (The snake grew by 1 segment because the game implies growth happens *after* the move if an apple was collected, or perhaps simply that the tail stays put for the first move; since I had 0 apples, I did not grow, and the body should reflect the previous head position).\n*Correction on body/length*: Since I started Turn 1 at (6, 4) and made no move yet (this is turn 2 logic processing turn 1 move), and I had 0 apples, I should not have grown. My head in Turn 1 was (7, 4). My body should be the *old* head position, i.e., (6, 4). This confirms my current state: Head (7, 4), Body (6, 4). Length is 2.\n\n**Enemy State (Turn 2):**\nSnake #1 Head: (0, 2). Body: (0, 1). Length 2. (It moved UP from (0, 1) in Turn 1, assuming it also chose a path towards an apple or randomly).\n\n**Target Analysis (Apples):** (9, 3), (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 3), (9, 4)\nMy Head: (7, 4).\n\nClosest apples to (7, 4):\n1. (9, 4): Manhattan distance = $|9-7| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2$ **(Closest)**\n2. (9, 3): Manhattan distance = $|9-7| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3$\n3. (4, 6): Manhattan distance = $|4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5$\n4. (1, 3): Manhattan distance = $|1-7| + |3-4| = 6 + 1 = 7$\n5. (4, 0): Manhattan distance = $|4-7| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7$\n\nThe nearest apple is (9, 4). Goal: Move RIGHT towards (9, 4).\n\n**Move Evaluation (Starting at (7, 4)):**\nMy body occupies (6, 4). The cell behind me (tail, but irrelevant for self-collision unless moving backward) is (6, 4). The \"backwards\" cell from the head (7, 4) is (6, 4).\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT (to (8, 4))**: Moves towards (9, 4).\n    *   Safety: Safe from self-collision. (8, 4) is not (6, 4).\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake #1 head is at (0, 2). No danger.\n    *   Advantage: Progress towards nearest apple (9, 4).\n\n2.  **Move UP (to (7, 5))**: Moves towards (4, 6).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (6, 4))**: Moves into my own body segment! (6, 4) is occupied by my tail/body.\n    *   Safety: **Self-collision!** This move is illegal.\n\n4.  **Move DOWN (to (7, 3))**: Moves towards (9, 3).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n\n**Enemy Prediction for Collision Check (Crucial step as the enemy also moves):**\nSnake #1 Prediction: Assume it also targets an apple or moves somewhat predictably. It is far from me. Its head is at (0, 2). It would need to move about 7 steps East to reach my current x-coordinate (7). No immediate threat of collision with my body or head this turn.\n\n**Final Choice:**\nWe must avoid LEFT. RIGHT is the direction towards the closest apple (9, 4).\n\n**Short-term Plan:** Continue heading East towards (9, 4). If (9, 4) is eaten next turn, the goal shifts to (9, 3). If (9, 4) is eaten this turn, the snake grows, and the next move calculation must consider the new body location and the potential for the tail to become the new \"backwards\" spot, although for now, only the static previous head position matters for self-collision.\n\nMove RIGHT $\\rightarrow$ Head (8, 4). If it eats the apple, it grows to length 3, with body (7, 4), (6, 4).\n\nRIGHT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy snake is at Head (7, 4), Body (6, 4). The nearest apple is (9, 4), distance 2 away.\nI evaluated moves from (7, 4):\n1. RIGHT to (8, 4): Moves towards the closest apple. Safe from self-collision since (6, 4) is the occupied body cell, and (8, 4) is not (6, 4). Safe from enemy collision as Snake #1 is at (0, 2).\n2. UP to (7, 5): Safe, but further from the closest apple.\n3. LEFT to (6, 4): Suicide, as this collides with my own body segment (6, 4).\n4. DOWN to (7, 3): Safe, but further from the closest apple.\n\nThe optimal move is RIGHT to continue the direct path towards the nearest apple (9, 4). I will prioritize reaching this apple. If I eat it, the snake will grow, and I will re-evaluate the next turn.\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

(This implies I collected an apple on Turn 2, moving to (7, 4) then growing, or the board state provided at the top of THIS prompt (Turn 2 data) is the *actual* state after Turn 1 move, and I made another move that resulted in growth).\n\nLet's strictly adhere to the state provided at the very top for Turn 2/150:\n**Turn: 2 / 150**\nApples: (9, 3), (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 3), (9, 4)\nYour snake (ID 0): Head: (8, 4), Body: none, Apples: 0.\nSnake #1 Head: (0, 3), Body: none.\n\nThis means my last move (Turn 1) resulted in me moving from some position (P_old) to (8, 4), and I collected 0 apples, so I didn't grow, but my length increased to 1 segment? No, the body is listed as \"none\". This implies my snake length is 1, Head (8, 4).\nThe rationale provided for my last move (which resulted in the state for the *next* turn, Turn 2) stated: Head (7, 4), Body (6, 4).\n\n**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** The provided state at the top of the prompt IS the state *before* I make my move for Turn 2. The rationale block describes what I *thought* happened in Turn 1, leading to the state for Turn 2, but the state provided at the top is the ground truth for this turn's decision making.\n\n**State for Move Decision (Turn 2):**\nMy Head: (8, 4). Length 1 (Body: none).\nSnake 1 Head: (0, 3). Length 1 (Body: none).\nApples: (9, 3), (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 3), (9, 4).\n\n**Target Analysis (From (8, 4)):**\n1. (9, 4): Distance $|9-8| + |4-4| = 1$ **(Closest)**\n2. (9, 3): Distance $|9-8| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2$\n3. (4, 6): Distance $|4-8| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6$\n4. (1, 3): Distance $|1-8| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8$\n5. (4, 0): Distance $|4-8| + |0-4| = 4 + 4 = 8$\n\nI am aiming for apple (9, 4).\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (8, 4)):**\nBody collision: None, length 1.\nEnemy prediction: Snake 1 is at (0, 3). It is far.\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT (to (9, 4))**: Moves onto the closest apple!\n    *   Safety: Safe from self-collision. Safe from enemy collision.\n    *   Advantage: Collects apple (9, 4). Gain 1 point. Snake grows to length 2. Body will be (the old head position, 8, 4).\n\n2.  **Move LEFT (to (7, 4))**: Moves towards (9, 3) diagonally, or towards the cluster around x=4.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n\n3.  **Move UP (to (8, 5))**:\n\n4.  **Move DOWN (to (8, 3))**: Moves towards (9, 3).\n\n**Decision:** Moving RIGHT is the optimal move as it secures the nearest apple immediately, guaranteeing growth and points.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on securing the remaining apples moving Westward/SouthWest (9, 3), (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 3). Since the board edge is at X=9, staying near the edge for the next apple (9, 3) seems reasonable after collecting (9, 4).\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

I will then be positioned advantageously to move towards the central apples, perhaps aiming for (4, 6) next or assessing the positions of the apples near (1, 1) and (2, 1). Since Snake 1 is currently on the left side, it might move towards the center or the cluster of low-Y apples. I will prioritize reaching the next closest group of apples, likely aiming for (4, 6) next, which would involve moving LEFT repeatedly.\n\nDOWN",

This requires moving UP.\n\n**Enemy Position Check:**\nSnake 1 is at (2, 3). It is moving toward the cluster of apples at low Y coordinates or possibly heading towards the center.\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (9, 3)):**\nPossible moves: UP (to (9, 4)), DOWN (to (9, 2)), LEFT (to (8, 3)), RIGHT (out of bounds).\n\nThe immediately desired move is UP towards (9, 6).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to (9, 4))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: New head (9, 4). The cell (9, 4) is occupied by my body (segment 2). **This move is suicide.**\n    *   The cell behind my head (9, 3) is (9, 4). Moving UP means moving onto the cell directly in front of my previous head position, which is currently occupied by my own body segment.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to (9, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (9, 2) is empty. (The tail (8, 4) will move to (8, 3), but the head is moving onto a new spot).\n    *   Enemy prediction: Snake 1 at (2, 3) moving. If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 3). No collision. If Snake 1 moves UP to (2, 4). No collision. If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 2). No collision. If Snake 1 moves LEFT (off board).\n    *   Outcome: Moves away from the nearest apple (9, 6). It sets up for a future LEFT move if Snake 1 isn't blocking the path.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (8, 3))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (8, 3) is empty.\n    *   Enemy prediction: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Moves towards the center where the largest cluster of remaining apples is, but is slower to reach (9, 6).\n\n**Collision Analysis:** Since moving UP (the direct path towards (9, 6)) is fatal, I must move sideways or down. Moving LEFT seems better as it places me in a more central location to pivot towards the remaining apples (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1) or continue toward the edge later. Moving DOWN seems less strategically sound as it pushes me further away from all remaining apples except potentially (4, 0) if I snake around the bottom edge, which is risky.\n\nSince I cannot move UP, I must move LEFT or DOWN. Moving LEFT (8, 3) positions me better for the large group of apples on the left/center if Snake 1 continues to dominate the low Y values.\n\n**Enemy Movement Possibilities (Worst Case for me):** Snake 1 wants the apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1). If it moves RIGHT to (3, 3), it puts pressure on the center. If it moves UP to (2, 4), it aims for the upper side. If Snake 1 moves LEFT off the board, it dies. Let's assume Snake 1 avoids suicide and moves towards the center mass, perhaps RIGHT to (3, 3) or UP to (2, 4). Neither move compromises my position at (8, 3).\n\nChoosing LEFT to transition toward the left side apples while avoiding immediate self-destruction.\n\nLong-term plan: Move LEFT for several turns (to (8, 3) -> (7, 3) -> ...) to position ourselves near the central apples ((4, 6), (4, 0), (1,1), (2,1)). After reaching the left side, we can evaluate whether to go up to (4, 6) or down towards the (1,1)/(2,1) cluster, or potentially swing around to try (9, 6) later if the gap opens.\n\nLEFT",

(8, 2) is empty.\n    *   Outcome: Moves me slightly away from all apples except potentially setting up a path towards (4, 0) later, but it feels less efficient than moving horizontally.\n\n4.  **Move LEFT (to (7, 3))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (7, 3) is empty.\n    *   Outcome: Continues the lateral movement towards the main cluster of apples. This seems strategically superior for the long game given the immediate block on (9, 6) access.\n\n**Comparison: UP (8, 4) vs LEFT (7, 3)**\nMoving UP is slow progress towards the far corner (9, 6) but keeps me away from Snake 1's path towards the low-Y apples.\nMoving LEFT is direct progress towards the mid-board apples (4, 6), (4, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1).\n\nSnake 1 is at (1, 3). It is likely aiming for (1, 1) or (2, 1). If Snake 1 moves towards these, it might stay low on the board. Moving LEFT to (7, 3) keeps us ahead of the central action.\n\nI will continue moving left/horizontally to position myself for the next meal near X=4, as the path to X=9 is currently too long without better footing.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving LEFT as long as possible (until X=0) or until a better opportunity (like a short path to an apple) opens up. Current priority is reaching the X=4 zone.\n\nLEFT\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nMy immediate goal is to maintain lateral progress towards the central apple clusters (X=1 to X=4). Moving LEFT to (7, 3) achieves this. I must navigate around Snake 1, which seems focused on the bottom-left corner apples (1, 1), (2, 1). I will move LEFT until I reach a better position to pivot up towards (4, 6) or down towards (4, 0)/(1, 1)/(2, 1). I must remain aware of the path to (9, 6) but accessing it currently requires too many turns without intermediate gains.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**",

Length 2.\n\nMy last move was DOWN, moving from (8, 3) to (8, 2). This put me in a position to access the lowest row (Y=0) apples, specifically (4, 0).\n\n**Target Apple Priority (Closest distance Manhattan):**\n1. (4, 0): Distance is 4 + 2 = 6. (A good target zone now)\n2. (1, 1): Distance is 7 + 1 = 8.\n3. (2, 1): Distance is 6 + 1 = 7.\n4. (9, 6): Distance is 1 + 4 = 5. (Still far)\n5. (4, 6): Distance is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe nearest accessible apple appears to be (4, 0) from my current position (8, 2) via a path that goes left/down. However, moving directly towards (4, 0) might mean spending several turns moving horizontally across Y=0.\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 3). It is well-positioned to pursue (1, 1) or (2, 1).\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (8, 2)):**\nPossible moves: UP (to (8, 3)), DOWN (to (8, 1)), LEFT (to (7, 2)), RIGHT (to (9, 2)).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to (8, 3))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (8, 3) is occupied by my body segment 2. **This move is suicide.** (Moving directly back to the cell the head just vacated is illegal if that cell is still occupied, which it is, as the body list represents the current state). *Correction: My body is [(8, 3), (9, 3)]. (8, 3) is my immediate previous cell/segment 2. Moving back into the cell the head *just* left is *only* illegal if that cell is occupied by a segment other than the tail that has just vacated. Since my length is 3, the tail is at (9, 3). Moving to (8, 3) means moving into the cell my head was in one turn ago, which is now occupied by segment 2. This is a collision.* **Move UP is suicide.**\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to (8, 1))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (8, 1) is empty.\n    *   Outcome: Continues moving generally down/left towards (4, 0). Distance to (4, 0) drops to 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (7, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (7, 2) is empty.\n    *   Outcome: Continues lateral progress towards the center. Distance to (1, 1)/(2, 1) is slightly reduced, but distance to (4, 0) increases slightly (5 + 1 = 6).\n\n4.  **Move RIGHT (to (9, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe. (9, 2) is empty.\n    *   Outcome: Moves away from all apples except possibly setting up an edge run towards (9, 6). This seems inefficient.\n\n**Comparison: DOWN (8, 1) vs LEFT (7, 2)**\nSnake 1 is higher up (Y=3). If Snake 1 goes UP this turn, it risks hitting the wall or moving towards the top apples. If it moves LEFT/DOWN to get apples (1, 1) or (2, 1), it will be near Y=1 or Y=2.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 1) seems more direct towards eating (4, 0) soon, whereas LEFT (7, 2) might lead to a better overall path if the density of apples near Y=1 is prioritized.\n\nLet's re-examine paths to the central apples:\nPath to (2, 1) (Snake 1's target):\nCurrent (8, 2) -> LEFT (7, 2) -> LEFT (6, 2) -> ... -> (2, 2) -> DOWN (2, 1) [Apple]. This takes 7 moves conservatively.\n\nPath to (4, 0):\nCurrent (8, 2) -> DOWN (8, 1) -> LEFT (7, 1) -> LEFT (6, 1) -> LEFT (5, 1) -> LEFT (4, 1) -> DOWN (4, 0) [Apple]. (6 moves if we stay at Y=1 horizontally). If we use DOWN (8, 1), the distance is 5 steps.\n\nThe pursuit of (4, 0) seems slightly faster/more direct given the current low Y-position. Let's commit to moving left along the bottom half of the board for now. LEFT (7, 2) keeps us slightly higher, which might be better for general maneuvering relative to Snake 1, which is currently high.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 2), my next move could be LEFT again, or DOWN to (7, 1) to start approaching Y=0 apples. If I move DOWN to (8, 1), I commit to Y=1 pathway.\n\nGiven that the previous move was DOWN, moving LEFT now keeps the momentum towards the overall center/left cluster of apples and avoids committing exclusively to the bottom edge initially.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT (7, 2) to continue progressing horizontally towards the main apple cluster.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nMy primary goal is to secure apples in the X=1 to X=4 region. I am currently at (8, 2). I will prioritize moving LEFT towards X=2/X=3. I need to keep an eye on Snake 1's position (currently 2, 3) as it targets the apples near X=1, Y=1. Moving LEFT currently positions me well to intercept the lower apples (1, 1), (2, 1) or pivot up towards (4, 6). I will continue moving LEFT unless a clear path to (4, 0) opens up via a downward move.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",

Distance to (2, 1) is now 5 steps (7->6->5->4->3->2 [apple]). If Snake 1 were to move UP/LEFT towards one of these, I might be able to steal it or block. Distance to (4, 0) is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (6, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Continues horizontal progression toward the center.

Moving to (8, 2) runs into my own body.)\n\n**Comparison: DOWN (7, 1) vs LEFT (6, 2)**\nBoth moves bring me closer to the apples in the (1, 1) to (4, 0) range.\n\nIf I move LEFT (6, 2), I maintain Y=2, hoping to sweep across toward X=0/1 or pivot toward (4, 6).\nIf I move DOWN (7, 1), I commit to the bottom half of the board, which is where the apples are currently dense.\n\nSnake 1 (2, 2) is likely to move LEFT (to 1, 2) or DOWN (to 2, 1 - eating an apple).\n\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 1) and eats, it now has 2 apples, and my distance advantage over (4, 0) is reduced relative to the race.\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 1), I am now 3 steps from (4, 0) and 5 steps from (2, 1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), I am 3 steps from (4, 0) and 4 steps from (2, 1).\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 2) keeps me on the same horizontal track as Snake 1's head if it moves horizontally, and keeps a slight proximity advantage to the central low apples (2, 1). It maintains flexibility to pivot up or down next turn.\n\nLet's prioritize maintaining forward progress towards the dense region.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT (6, 2). This continues the move towards X=0/1 while keeping options open. If Snake 1 moves down to (2, 1), I can respond by moving down next turn toward (4, 0) or trying to block around (1, 2).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nMy current path is moving horizontally towards the left/center of the board (X=0 to X=4). Snake 1 is currently near the target apples (1, 1) and (2, 1). I will continue moving LEFT to pursue these apples or the nearby apple at (4, 0). My next move will likely be LEFT again, unless DOWN becomes immediately advantageous for eating (4, 0) or blocking Snake 1 from reaching (1, 1) / (2, 1). I must be wary of committing too far left if Snake 1 secures the Y=1 apples quickly.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",

Snake 1 is also well positioned to pivot down towards (2, 1) or (1, 1).\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (6, 2)):**\nPossible moves: UP (to (6, 3)), DOWN (to (6, 1)), LEFT (to (5, 2)), RIGHT (to (7, 2)).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to (6, 3))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Moves away from the main cluster of apples (Y=0, Y=1). Might be useful if Snake 1 commits to the bottom.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to (6, 1))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Directly targets the bottom apples. Distance to (4, 0) is 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Distance to (2, 1) is 4 steps. This is a strong attacking move towards the nearest low apples.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (5, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Continues horizontal sweep towards X=0. Distance to (2, 1) is 3 steps.\n\n4.  **Move RIGHT (to (7, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: (7, 2) is my body segment 1. **This move results in self-collision and death.**\n\n**Comparison: DOWN (6, 1) vs LEFT (5, 2)**\nBoth moves bring me closer to the apples simultaneously located at (2, 1) and (4, 0), which are both 3-4 steps away.\n\nIf I move LEFT (5, 2), Snake 1 (3, 2) can also move LEFT (2, 2 - body) or DOWN (3, 1) or RIGHT/UP. If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (3, 1), it's one step closer to (2, 1) than I am to (4, 0) if I move LEFT.\n\nIf I move DOWN (6, 1), I immediately commit to the bottom row.\nDistance from (6, 1):\n*   To (4, 0): 2 horizontal, 1 vertical = 3 steps.\n*   To (2, 1): 4 horizontal, 0 vertical = 4 steps.\n\nLet's see what Snake 1 does. Snake 1 is at (3, 2). If it moves DOWN to (3, 1), then:\n*   My move (6, 1) allows me to reach (4, 0) next turn (1 move) if Snake 1 doesn't interfere.\n*   Snake 1 at (3, 1) can reach (2, 1) next turn (1 move).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), I am setting up a race for (4, 0). This seems slightly better than maintaining Y=2, as the apples are concentrated lower.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT this turn, it might land on my path next turn.\nSnake 1 moves from (3, 2).\nSafe moves for Snake 1: UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), LEFT (2, 2 - body, suicide), RIGHT (4, 2).\nSnake 1 *cannot* go LEFT this turn as (2, 2) is its own body (Body: [(2, 2)], Head was (3, 2)). Wait, my board reading of Snake 1's body from the turn start seems slightly off based on the previous turn analysis.\n\n*Revisiting Snake 1 position based on previous turn:*\nTurn 7: Snake #1 - Head: (2, 2), Body: [(2, 3)]. Apples: 1. (This seems to be an error in my previous analysis reading the board state, let's trust the current board state provided.)\n\nCurrent State:\nSnake 1 Head: (3, 2), Body: [(2, 2)]. This means Snake 1's length is 2, and its head moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2) last turn, and its tail (2, 2) advanced one slot maintaining its previous position (2, 2). Wait, if the body is [(2, 2)], and the head is (3, 2), this implies the move was RIGHT, and the tail from the turn before (which was presumably (2, 3)) was dropped if it didn't eat.\nIf S1 moved RIGHT last turn: Head (2, 2) -> (3, 2). Old body (2, 3) moved to (2, 2). So S1 body is [(3, 2), (2, 2)]. This matches the board interpretation: 1 is at (3, 2) and T is at (2, 2).\n\nSnake 1 (3, 2) moves available: UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), RIGHT (4, 2). LEFT (2, 2) is illegal (into body).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 1), and Snake 1 goes DOWN to (3, 1):\nMy next state: H(6, 1), B[(7, 2), (8, 2)]. S1 state: H(3, 1), B[(2, 2)].\nI am set up to potentially grab (4, 0) next. Snake 1 is better placed for (2, 1) next turn.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 2), and Snake 1 goes DOWN to (3, 1):\nMy next state: H(5, 2), B[(6, 2), (7, 2)]. S1 state: H(3, 1), B[(2, 2)].\nSnake 1 is now in a better position to dive for (2, 1) than I am for (4, 0).\n\nCommitting downward seems the best immediate aggression towards the closest visible apple source ((4, 0) is only 3 steps away).\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (6, 1).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nImmediately prioritize reaching the apples at Y=0 or Y=1, specifically targeting (4, 0) first due to proximity, planning to use (6, 1) next to reach (4, 0) in 1 move. I must be wary of Snake 1 aggressively pursuing (2, 1) or (1, 1). If Snake 1 commits downwards, I maintain a slight lead towards (4, 0). If Snake 1 commits horizontally/upwards, I secure (4, 0) easily.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nDOWN",

(2, 1) / (1, 1): Distance 4 horizontal, 0 vertical = 4 steps to (2, 1).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (Snake 1 at (2, 2)):**\nSnake 1 is close to the cluster of apples at Y=1.\nSnake 1 moves from (2, 2). Safe moves: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1 - eats apple!), RIGHT (3, 2 - body, suicide), LEFT (1, 2).\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 1), it eats an apple and grows.\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (6, 1)):**\nPossible moves: UP (to (6, 2)), DOWN (to (6, 0)), LEFT (to (5, 1)), RIGHT (to (7, 1)).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to (6, 2))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe (Body is [(6, 2), (7, 2)]). (6, 2) is my segment 1. **This move results in self-collision and death.** (Moving directly backward into the segment immediately behind the head is illegal).\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to (6, 0))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: One step closer to (4, 0) (Distance 2 steps). If Snake 1 pursues Y=1, I secure (4, 0) next turn.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (5, 1))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Moves towards the (2, 1) / (1, 1) apples. Distance to (2, 1) is 3 steps. Distance to (4, 0) is 1 + 1 = 2 steps (since I am now at Y=1). This seems excellent for targeting both bottom apples.\n\n4.  **Move RIGHT (to (7, 1))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Outcome: Moves away from the main cluster, towards the edge. Not optimal.\n\n**Comparison: DOWN (6, 0) vs LEFT (5, 1)**\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0): I am 2 moves away from (4, 0).\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 1) (eats apple): S1 Head (2, 1), S1 length 3.\nMy next move from (6, 0) would likely be LEFT to (5, 0) or (5, 1) to catch up.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 1): I am 1 move from (4, 0) and 1 move from (2, 1).\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (2, 1) (eats apple): S1 Head (2, 1), S1 length 3.\nNext turn, I can move to (4, 0) (eating it) or (3, 1) (trying to intercept S1 path).\nIf I move to (4, 0), my head is at (4, 0). S1 is at (2, 1). We are safe from collision.\n\nGoing LEFT seems more proactive, as it positions me centrally between my two closest targets ((4, 0) and (2, 1)) while Snake 1 is likely to grab one of them. If Snake 1 takes (2, 1), I secure (4, 0) next turn. If Snake 1 ignores (2, 1), I might be able to grab it or (4, 0) depending on its choice.\n\nLet's verify Snake 1's choices if I move LEFT to (5, 1):\nS1 (2, 2) available moves: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1 - eats), LEFT (1, 2). RIGHT (3, 2) suicide based on body [(3, 2)]. Wait, S1 body is [(3, 2)] means its previous head was (3, 2), and its body *is* (3, 2).\nPrevious state: S1 Head (3, 2), Body [(2, 2)].\nIf S1 moved RIGHT last turn: (3, 2) -> (4, 2). Old body (2, 2) -> (3, 2). S1 Head (4, 2), Body [(3, 2), (2, 2)].\n*Board shows S1 Head at (2, 2), Body [(3, 2)] -- This means the board state provided for Turn 9 is inconsistent with the move stated in Turn 8 Rationale if the turn 8 move was executed.*\n\n**Trusting the explicit board/state provided for Turn 9, NOT the implicit result of the Turn 8 preferred move.**\nS1 Head: (2, 2), Body: [(3, 2)]. Length 2. Apple count 1.\nThis implies S1 moved LEFT last turn: from (3, 2) to (2, 2), dropping (2, 3) (assuming that was X, Y tracking previously). The body [(3, 2)] means its tail is at (3, 2). The head is at (2, 2). This is impossible for a standard linear snake body definition (head-to-tail). If the body list provided is always the *next* segment after the head, then A->B->C->D, the list is [B, C, D].\nIf S1 Head is (2, 2) and Body is [(3, 2)], this means: (2, 2) -> (3, 2). This snake is only 2 long and pointing Right.\n\nAllowed moves for S1 (Head 2, 2, Body 3, 2):\nUP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1 - EATS APPLE), LEFT (1, 2). RIGHT (3, 2) is into body - SUICIDE.\n\nSince Snake 1 is almost guaranteed to go DOWN to (2, 1) and gain an apple, I must react optimally to that likely scenario.\nS1 -> (2, 1), new length 3.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1):\nI am 3 steps from S1's new head, and 2 steps from (4, 0). I can safely grab (4, 0) next turn.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 0):\nI am 4 steps from S1's new head, and 2 steps from (4, 0). I can safely grab (4, 0) next turn.\n\nThe advantage of LEFT (5, 1) over DOWN (6, 0) is that (5, 1) is also adjacent to the apple cluster at (1, 1)/(2, 1) that Snake 1 is targeting, maintaining better pressure/coverage there. (6, 0) moves me too far away from the Y=1 zone if S1 grabs (2, 1).\n\nTherefore, LEFT (5, 1) is the better positional move, setting up a clean capture of (4, 0) next turn, regardless of Snake 1's predictable move to (2, 1).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nSecure the apple at (4, 0) next turn (Turn 10) by moving to (5, 1) this turn. After securing (4, 0), reassess aiming for the Y=1 apples, keeping an eye on Snake 1's growth and location. Given the board asymmetry, I should continue pressuring the lower side before moving up to (4, 6) or (9, 6).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",

Wait, the board key says: \"1\" is Snake #1 Head, \"T\" is Snake segments.\nBoard interpretation: Snake 1 Head is at (2, 3). Body segment is at (2, 2).\nPossible moves for S1 (2, 3):\nUP (2, 4): Safe.\nDOWN (2, 2): Hits own body segment at (2, 2) if the body is defined as [Tail... (2, 2)]. Given standard representation, if the body list is *only* the segment immediately behind the head, then (2, 2) is the immediately previous position, and moving back there is suicide. If (2, 2) is an older segment, moving there is allowed IF the tail moved out of (2, 2).\nSnake 1 length is 2 (1 head + 1 body = 2 total segments). If it moved last turn, its tail must have been at (2, 2) *before* the move. If S1 moved from (2, 2) to (2, 3) last turn, then (2, 2) is its tail segment, and moving back into it is **suicide**. I will assume moving into the single listed body segment is suicide.\nRIGHT (3, 3): Safe.\nLEFT (1, 3): Safe.\nSnake 1 is likely to move to (2, 4), (3, 3), or (1, 3) to avoid collision or stay near the middle. It is unlikely to threaten my current path to (4, 0) immediately.\n\n**Move Evaluation (From (5, 1)):**\nPossible moves: UP (to (5, 2)), DOWN (to (5, 0)), LEFT (to (4, 1)), RIGHT (to (6, 1)).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to (5, 2))**: Safe. Moves away from the closest apples ((4, 0), (2, 1)). Not optimal.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to (5, 0))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Distance to (4, 0): 1 step. If I move here, next turn I eat (4, 0). This is the most direct route to the closest apple.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to (4, 1))**:\n    *   Self-collision check: Safe.\n    *   Distance to (4, 0): 1 step down.

This keeps the option open to pivot left towards the (2, 1) apple (or (1, 1)) immediately after taking (4, 0), or to swing up towards (4, 6).

Since the snake grew when collecting its 2nd apple, the body length of 3 is correct: Head (4, 1), Body (5, 1), (6, 1). This aligns with the rationale from Turn 10 where the head was (5, 1) and body was [(6, 1), (6, 2)]. The move LEFT from (5, 1) to (4, 1) means S0's new body is [(5, 1), (6, 1)]. Wait, snake movement means the tail drops off, and the new head position is added to the front.\n--- Re-evaluating body state based on your last move (LEFT from (5, 1) to (4, 1)) ---\nOld: Head (5, 1), Body [(6, 1), (6, 2)]. Length 3.\nNew Head: (4, 1).\nNew Body: The old head (5, 1) becomes the new first body segment. The old second segment (6, 1) becomes the new second segment. The old tail (6, 2) drops off (unless an apple was eaten, which it wasn't).\nExpected New Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1)]. This matches the current listed body state: Head: (4, 1), Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1)]. (Length 3). This is consistent.\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (1, 3), Body: [(2, 3)], Apples: 1 (Note: Snake 1 moved from (2, 3) to (1, 3) if the last move was LEFT OR if it moved UP, DOWN, or RIGHT and its body adjusted such that (2, 3) is now the second segment.\nIf S1 Head was (2, 3) and Body was [(2, 2)] last turn:\nIf S1 moved LEFT to (1, 3): New Body is [(2, 3)]. This matches the current S1 state: Head (1, 3), Body [(2, 3)]. This implies Snake #1 chose LEFT last turn.\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . A . . . .

(1, 3) 1 (2, 3) T (3, 3) . ...\nThis implies Snake 1 Head is at (1, 3). Its immediate body segment (tail end) is at (2, 3). This means S1 moved RIGHT last turn from (2, 3) to (1, 3) is impossible (unless the head is always listed first, and the body follows sequentially toward the tail).\nStandard format: Head is first. Body follows, ordered down to the tail.\nIf Current S1 is Head (1, 3), Body [(2, 3)]: This means S1 moved from (2, 3) to (1, 3) (LEFT) and its tail segment (2, 3) filled the gap, OR S1 moved from something else, and its body is now (2, 3).\nIf S1 was at (2, 3) before, and it moved LEFT to (1, 3), its new body should be the old head position: [(2, 3)]. This matches the observation. Snake 1 moved LEFT.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis (Turn 11)**\nMy Head: (4, 1). Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1)]. Length 3.\nTarget Apple: (4, 0) [Distance 1 DOWN].\nSnake 1 Head: (1, 3). Body: [(2, 3)]. Length 2.\n\n**My Move Options from (4, 1):**\n1. UP (to (4, 2)): Safe. Keeps me high. Distance to (4, 0) increases to 3.\n2. DOWN (to (4, 0)): **Eat Apple!** Head moves onto (4, 0). Score increases to 3. New body: [(4, 1), (5, 1)]. Length 4.\n3. LEFT (to (3, 1)): Safe. Next move would be (3, 0) or (2, 1) path. Distance to (4, 0) increases to 2 (via (4, 0) next turn).\n4. RIGHT (to (5, 1)): Hits own body segment. **Suicide.**\n\n**Snake 1 predicted moves (from (1, 3)):**\nS1 Head (1, 3). Body [(2, 3)].\nPossible moves:\n*   UP (1, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN (1, 2): Safe.\n*   LEFT (0, 3): Safe (on board edge).\n*   RIGHT (2, 3): Hits its own body segment. **Suicide.** (Assuming (2, 3) is the T segment immediately behind the head, and the tail hasn't moved out of it).\n\nIf S1 is restricted from moving into (2, 3), its options are (1, 4), (1, 2), or (0, 3). It seems S1 is moving towards the left edge or upward/downward. Neither path immediately intersects mine near (4, 0).\n\n**Choosing the Move:**\nMoving DOWN to (4, 0) captures the closest apple immediately and solidifies the lower grouping goal. Since I have a safe window (S1 is far away and seems restricted from moving right), capturing the apple now is the best strategy. This sets up the next target as (2, 1) via (3, 0) or (4, 1) depending on where I settle after eating.\n\nMove: DOWN (to (4, 0)).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nGoal: Clear apples around Y=0, Y=1 before engaging high apples or Snake 1 further.\nTurn 11: Move DOWN to (4, 0) and eat the apple. Score = 3. New Head (4, 0), Body [(4, 1), (5, 1)].\nTurn 12: From (4, 0), the next target is (2, 1) or (1, 1). Moving UP to (4, 1) or LEFT to (3, 0) seems preferable. (3, 0) sets up a direct path toward (2, 1). I will prioritize moving LEFT/UP towards the remaining closest apples (2, 1) and (1, 1). Snake 1 seems to be moving towards the left edge or looping up/down near X=1. My position will be safe.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

I continue towards (2, 1).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (5, 0): No collision risk.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\nMy priority is to eat the remaining low apples (1, 1) and (2, 1) before they are taken, especially since S1 is positioned perfectly to take (1, 1). If S1 takes (1, 1), it grows, potentially becoming a larger obstacle or threat.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 0), S1 moves to (1, 1).\nNext turn, my head is (3, 0). S1's head is (1, 1). Apple (2, 1) remains.\nFrom (3, 0), I move UP to (3, 1).\nS1 from (1, 1) would likely move UP to (1, 2) (if it needs length adjustments) or RIGHT towards (2, 1) if it's aggressive. If S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 1), it eats the last low apple.\n\nI need to get to (2, 1) before S1 does. Moving LEFT to (3, 0) sets up a direct path (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) or (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (2, 1).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 0), I waste a turn moving away from the fight for the low apples.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best aggressive move to pursue the cluster of apples (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nImmediate Goal: Secure (2, 1) apple, as (1, 1) is likely lost to Snake 1 this turn.\nTurn 12: Move LEFT to (3, 0). Body becomes [(4, 0), (4, 1)]. S1 likely moves to (1, 1).\nTurn 13: From (3, 0), move UP to (3, 1). This positions me directly adjacent to (2, 1) and (1, 1) (which S1 now occupies/has left). S1 will likely move to (2, 1) or continue expanding from (1, 1). If S1 moves to (2, 1), I am safe adjacent to it and can plan my next move toward the high apples or watch S1's growth. If S1 moves elsewhere, I eat (2, 1) next turn.\n**Current strategy remains focused on the low apple cluster.**\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

DOWN (to (3, -1)): Off board. **Suicide.**\n3. LEFT (to (2, 0)): Safe. Adjacent/close to (2, 1). Body [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)].\n4. RIGHT (to (4, 0)): Hits own body segment (4, 0). **Suicide.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Snake 1 predicted moves from (1, 1):** (Targeting (2, 1) or moving away)\nS1 Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)].\n1. UP (to (1, 2)): Hits own body segment (1, 2). **Suicide.**\n2. DOWN (to (1, 0)): Safe. Moves away from apple (2, 1).\n3. LEFT (to (0, 1)): Safe. Moves away from apple (2, 1).\n4. RIGHT (to (2, 1)): **Eat Apple!** S1 eats (2, 1). S1 score becomes 3.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (2, 1) and eats the last low apple.\n\n**Collision Check with S1 predicted move (S1 -> (2, 1)):**\nIf S1 moves to (2, 1):\n*   If I move UP to (3, 1): No collision. My head is at (3, 1), S1 head is at (2, 1). Safe.\n*   If I move LEFT to (2, 0): No collision. My head is at (2, 0), S1 head is at (2, 1). Safe.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\nIf S1 takes (2, 1), the low apple cluster is gone. My priority shifts to the mid-board apples/safety.\nIf I move UP to (3, 1), I am adjacent to S1's new position (2, 1). This keeps pressure on S1 and prepares for a possible future collision if S1 tries to corner me, or allows me to transition to the higher apples (5, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0), I am one cell away diagonally from S1's new position (2, 1). This seems slightly less direct positioning than (3, 1) for boundary management, although (2, 0) is a very low position setting up for a move right/up next turn.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 1) places my head adjacent to S1's head (2, 1). This is often a good position for applying pressure or watching containment, especially if S1 is now long and may have less room to maneuver later. Since the low apples are lost regardless, I prioritize setting up the best position for the middle apples ((5, 5), (4, 6)). (3, 1) is closer to both the center and higher ground than (2, 0).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nImmediate Goal: Move towards the central/upper apples ((5, 5), (4, 6)) now that the low apples are likely consumed by S1. Maintain safe distance from S1 (now at (2, 1) or nearby).\nTurn 13: Move UP to (3, 1). S1 likely moves to (2, 1).\nTurn 14: If S1 is at (2, 1), I can move LEFT to (2, 1) (Head-on collision, DANGER!) or RIGHT to (4, 1) (Hits own body segment (4, 1) if I move right to (4, 1), wait, my body is [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1)]. Moving to (4, 1) hits my own body segment (4, 1).).\nLet's recheck body move validity if I go UP to (3, 1):\nMy old body was [(4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1)]. New head (3, 1). New body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Tail (5, 1) is pushed out if I didn't eat. If I eat, length increases. I did not eat. So tail (5, 1) is removed.\nTurn 13: Head (3, 0) -> (3, 1). Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Tail (5, 1) is dropped. Length 4. OK.\n\nS1 next move from (2, 1) (Assuming it ate (2, 1)): Body: [(2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]. Length 5.\nMy head (3, 1). S1 head (2, 1).\nFrom (3, 1):\n1. UP (to (3, 2)): Safe. Moves towards (4, 6).\n2. DOWN (to (3, 0)): Safe. Moves away from S1, towards tail end.\n3. LEFT (to (2, 1)): Head-on collision with S1 head! **Suicide.**\n4. RIGHT (to (4, 1)): Hits own body segment (4, 1). **Suicide.**\n\nSo, if S1 eats (2, 1), my only viable moves next turn are UP or DOWN. UP is better for advancing toward apples.\n\nUP seems like the best controlled progression.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

Tail (4, 1) is now the newest segment, (5, 1) from the last turn was dropped. Wait, looking at the previous turn's state:\nTurn 13 state: Head (3, 0), Body [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. (Correction: My body list in rationale was [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1)] which implies length 5 before move, but the state said length 4 earlier in rationale. Let's use the given state for Turn 14 which reflects the result of UP move: Head (3, 1), Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]). This means my length is 4, and the segment at (5, 1) was dropped, confirming no apple eaten on Turn 13.\n\nSnake 1 Head: (2, 1). Snake 1 Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. Length 4 (no apple eaten on Turn 13, as S1 ate (2, 1) last turn, so its length should have increased).\n\n***Re-evaluating Turn 13 Apple Consumption***\nTurn 13 Apples: (4, 6), (2, 1), (9, 6), (5, 5), (0, 4).\nS1 Head was (1, 1). S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 1) and eats the apple (2, 1). S1 score goes from 2 to 3. S1 length increases by 1.\nS0 Head moved UP to (3, 1). S0 did not eat. S0 length remains 4.\n\nIf S1 ate (2, 1) on Turn 13:\nS1 Head: (2, 1). S1 Body *before* tail drop: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. New length 5. New Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)].\n\nThe provided state for Turn 14 suggests S1 only has 3 body segments: Head (2, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. This implies that EITHER S1 did not eat (2, 1) OR the board state presentation is slightly inconsistent following growth. Given scores are tied at 3, S1 definitely ate one of the low apples. Let's assume the provided current state is accurate for move calculation:\nS0: Head (3, 1), Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Length 4.\nS1: Head (2, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. Length 4. (This means S1 did *not* grow last turn, perhaps the apple (2, 1) was gone, or S1 chose not to move towards it, or the score reporting is based only on pre-turn apples).\n\nLet's stick strictly to the provided Turn 14 state:\nMy Head: (3, 1). My Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)].\nS1 Head: (2, 1). S1 Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)].\n\n**My Move Options (from (3, 1)): Head at (3, 1), Body segments at (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)**\n1. UP (to (3, 2)): Safe. No self-collision. S1 head is at (2, 1).\n2. DOWN (to (3, 0)): Hits own body segment (3, 0). **Suicide.**\n3. LEFT (to (2, 1)): Head-on collision with S1 head at (2, 1). **Suicide.**\n4. RIGHT (to (4, 1)): Hits own body segment (4, 1). **Suicide.**\n\nOnly UP is safe this turn based on the current topology and simultaneous movement rule where collisions are checked at the destination cell.\n\n**S1 Prediction (from (2, 1)): Body segments at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)**\nIf S1 moves UP (to (2, 2)): Safe. Towards high apples.\nIf S1 moves DOWN (to (2, 0)): Safe. Towards low ground.\nIf S1 moves LEFT (to (1, 1)): Hits own body segment (1, 1). Suicide.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (to (3, 1)): Head-on collision with my head (3, 1). Mutual suicide. (This is why my move UP is critical, it prevents S1 from moving RIGHT into me).\n\nSince my only safe move is UP, I must take it. If S1 moves RIGHT, we both die, and since scores are tied (3-3), the game might end in a draw based on the last state before collision. However, in simultaneous movement, both dying from a head-on collision is an accepted outcome if both players choose that move. My choice must maximize my survival/advantage among *all* safe options. Since only UP is safe for me, this is the only choice.\n\n**If I move UP to (3, 2):**\n*   If S1 moves UP to (2, 2): My head is safe at (3, 2). New states are established for Turn 15.\n*   If S1 moves DOWN to (2, 0): My head is safe at (3, 2).\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 1): Head-on collision. Both die. Draw based on score tie (3-3).\n\nIf I have only one safe move, I must execute it.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nMy only available move is UP to (3, 2). This places my head adjacent to S1's new potential position (2, 2) if S1 moves similarly towards the center mass of apples (4, 6), (5, 5). This move avoids immediate death and maintains pressure vertically. Next turn, I will aim towards (4, 6) or (5, 5).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nMove UP to (3, 2). This is the only safe move. Monitor S1's move. If S1 moves into (3, 1) we tie/draw. If S1 moves elsewhere, I am positioned well to advance towards (4, 6) or (5, 5) on Turn 15.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nUP",

S1's last move was also UP, landing them at (2, 2). This created a 1-cell horizontal separation, which is stable for now. We are close together, adjacent to apples (4, 6) and (5, 5) diagonally.\n\n**My Move Options (from (3, 2))**\n1. **UP (to (3, 3))**: Safe. Moves away from S1 (2, 2).

Moves towards the center of the high-value apples ((4, 6), (5, 5)).\n\nSafe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n**S1 Prediction (from (2, 2))**\nS1 is also looking at the apples (4, 6) and (5, 5).\n*   If S1 moves UP (to (2, 3)): Safe. Heads towards the top edge.\n*   If S1 moves DOWN (to (2, 1)): Hits own body segment (2, 1). **Suicide.**\n*   If S1 moves LEFT (to (1, 2)): Hits own body segment (1, 2). **Suicide.**\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT (to (3, 2)): Hits my head at (3, 2). **Mutual Suicide.**\n\nS1's only remaining safe move is UP (to (2, 3)). They cannot move RIGHT towards (3, 2) because that would cause self-suicide or mutual suicide based on where their body segments are, but WAIT: S1 body is [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)]. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) does not hit any current body segments.\n\nRecalculating S1's options from (2, 2): [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)]\n1. UP (2, 3): Safe.\n2. DOWN (2, 1): Hits own body (2, 1). **Suicide.**\n3. LEFT (1, 2): Hits own body (1, 2). **Suicide.**\n4. RIGHT (3, 2): Moves into my head cell. **Mutual Suicide.**\n\nSo, S1's ONLY guaranteed safe move is UP to (2, 3).\n\n**Strategy based on S1 forced UP move:**\nIf I choose UP (to (3, 3)), S1 moves to (2, 3). We continue moving vertically, slightly separated.\nIf I choose RIGHT (to (4, 2)), S1 moves to (2, 3). We move apart horizontally, and I am closer to the apple at (5, 5) and (4, 6).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 2) seems like a better aggressive positioning move. It creates space between us while positioning me ideally for the next step towards the central apples (4, 6) and (5, 5). If S1 moves UP to (2, 3) or potentially tries a tricky move next turn, I will be in a better position to capitalize on the available apples.\n\nIf I go UP, S1 goes UP. We are parallel, but neither gains an immediate advantage towards the apples.\nIf I go RIGHT, I move towards the apples, and S1 moves away from me vertically. This seems stronger as it immediately asserts control over the central area.\n\n**Predicted Outcome if I choose RIGHT:**\nMy Head: (4, 2). S1 Head: (2, 3). No collision.\nMy Body becomes: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0)]. My tail (4, 0) drops.\n\nThis move keeps me alive and pushes me one step closer to the prize apples (4, 6) and (5, 5) without running into S1 who is likely moving upwards.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 2). This positions me aggressively between S1 (moving up column 2) and the cluster of apples at (4, 6) and (5, 5). Next turn, I will likely aim for (4, 3) or (5, 2) depending on S1's response.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nRIGHT",
