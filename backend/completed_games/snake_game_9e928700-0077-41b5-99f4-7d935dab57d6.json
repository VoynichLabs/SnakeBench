However, it's safe and doesn't immediately threaten you.\n\n2. **DOWN (9, 1)**:\n   - Check if (9, 1) is occupied: No.\n   - Check if off the board: No.\n   - Check for head-on collision: Enemy is at (1, 2), so no.\n   - Check if (9, 1) is an apple: No apple at (9, 1).\n   - Future implications: Moving DOWN keeps you near the bottom edge, which may also limit future options. However, it's safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (8, 2)**:\n   - Check if (8, 2) is occupied: No.\n   - Check if off the board: No.\n   - Check for head-on collision: Enemy is at (1, 2), so no.\n   - Check if (8, 2) is an apple: No apple at (8, 2).\n   - Future implications: Moving LEFT keeps you closer to the center of the board, which may provide more flexibility for future moves. It also doesn't immediately threaten you.\n\n### Evaluating Apple Accessibility:\n- The closest apple to your head (9, 2) is at (6, 1) (distance: sqrt((9-6)^2 + (2-1)^2) = sqrt(9 + 1) = ~3.16).\n- Other apples are farther away: (3, 7), (6, 3), (1, 4), (4, 8).\n- Moving LEFT (8, 2) brings you closer to the center, which may help in reaching more apples in the future.\n- Moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately bring you closer to any apple.\n\n### Evaluating Enemy Movement:\n- Enemy is at (1, 2). It can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n  - UP: (1, 3)\n  - DOWN: (1, 1)\n  - LEFT: (0, 2)\n  - RIGHT: (2, 2)\n- None of these moves threaten your current position (9, 2) or your potential next positions (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- Since you are a single head, prioritize moving toward the center to maximize future options.\n- Avoid getting trapped near the edges (top or bottom).\n- LEFT (8, 2) is the best move to keep you closer to the center and avoid limiting future flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision:\n**LEFT**",

          "rationale": "1) First, I list the four possible moves from my current head position (1, 2):\n   - UP: (1, 3)\n   - DOWN: (1, 1)\n   - LEFT: (0, 2)\n   - RIGHT: (2, 2)\n\n2) I eliminate moves that would immediately kill me:\n   - UP: (1, 3) is empty on the board, no collision with any snake or wall. Safe.\n   - DOWN: (1, 1) is empty on the board, no collision. Safe.\n   - LEFT: (0, 2) is empty on the board, no collision. Safe.\n   - RIGHT: (2, 2) is empty on the board, no collision. Safe.\n\n   All four moves are currently safe.\n\n3) Now I consider the enemy snake's possible moves. The enemy head is at (9, 2). Their possible moves:\n   - UP: (9, 3)\n   - DOWN: (9, 1)\n   - LEFT: (8, 2)\n   - RIGHT: (10, 2) - off the board, so they would die if they chose this.\n\n   The enemy is unlikely to choose RIGHT as it would kill them. So their likely moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n4) I assess the risk of head-on collisions:\n   - If I move RIGHT to (2, 2), the enemy could move LEFT to (8, 2), which is far away, so no collision.\n   - If I move UP to (1, 3), the enemy could move UP to (9, 3), which is far away, no collision.\n   - If I move DOWN to (1, 1), the enemy could move DOWN to (9, 1), far away, no collision.\n   - If I move LEFT to (0, 2), the enemy could move LEFT to (8, 2), far away, no collision.\n\n   No immediate head-on collision risk with any move.\n\n5) I look at the apples on the board and their distances from my current position (1, 2):\n   - (3, 7): distance = |3-1| + |7-2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n   - (6, 3): distance = |6-1| + |3-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n   - (1, 4): distance = |1-1| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - (6, 1): distance = |6-1| + |1-2| = 5 + 1 = 6\n   - (4, 8): distance = |4-1| + |8-2| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n   The closest apple is (1, 4), which is directly above me. Moving UP to (1, 3) gets me closer to this apple.\n\n6) I consider future options:\n   - Moving UP to (1, 3) keeps LEFT and RIGHT options open for the next move, and I can continue moving UP toward (1, 4).\n   - Moving DOWN to (1, 1) would put me near the apple at (6, 1), but it's farther away and I might get trapped near the bottom wall.\n   - Moving LEFT to (0, 2) would put me near the left wall, limiting future options.\n   - Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) would move me away from the closest apple and toward the center, but with less immediate benefit.\n\n7) Long-term plan:\n   - Prioritize moving toward the closest apple at (1, 4) by moving UP.\n   - After eating that apple, reassess the board for the next closest apple.\n   - Avoid moving near the enemy snake's likely path to minimize collision risks.\n\nFinal move: UP",

RIGHT is slightly better because it moves me directly toward two apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize eating the closest apples first: (4, 8) and (4, 9).\n- After eating (4, 8), the next target could be (4, 9) or (6, 3), depending on the board state.\n- Avoid getting trapped in the top-right corner (near (4, 9)) or the bottom-left corner (near (3, 1)).\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements, but they are currently far away and not an immediate threat.\n- Maintain flexibility by avoiding moves that limit future options (e.g., moving into a corner).\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Final Decision:**\n- RIGHT moves me directly toward the closest apples (4, 8) and (4, 9) and keeps future options open.\n- UP is also good but slightly less optimal for immediate apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple Distances from (4, 8):**\nCalculate Manhattan distance to each apple:\n- (6, 3): |6-4| + |3-8| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- (4, 9): |4-4| + |9-8| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- (3, 1): |3-4| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- (9, 7): |9-4| + |7-8| = 5 + 1 = 6\n- (1, 7): |1-4| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nClosest apple: (4, 9) at distance 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP to (4, 9):**\n   - Moves me directly onto the apple at (4, 9). I will eat it and grow.\n   - After eating, my body will be [(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6)].\n   - Opens up future moves: UP to (4, 10) (off the board, unsafe), LEFT to (3, 9), RIGHT to (5, 9).\n   - Risk: Moving UP could trap me in the top row if I don't plan carefully. However, (4, 9) is the closest apple, and eating it is optimal.\n\n2. **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n   - Moves me away from the closest apple (4, 9).\n   - Distance to (4, 9) becomes |4-3| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2 (farther).\n   - Opens up future moves: UP to (3, 9), LEFT to (2, 8), DOWN to (3, 7) (unsafe).\n   - Less optimal for immediate apple collection, but safer long-term if I need to avoid the top row.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n   - Moves me away from the closest apple (4, 9).\n   - Distance to (4, 9) becomes |4-5| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2 (farther).\n   - Opens up future moves: UP to (5, 9), RIGHT to (6, 8), DOWN to (5, 7).\n   - Less optimal for immediate apple collection, but could set up a path to (6, 3) or (9, 7).\n\n**Best Move for Apple Collection:** UP, as it directly eats the closest apple (4, 9).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize eating the closest apples first: (4, 9) and then (1, 7) or (9, 7).\n- After eating (4, 9), avoid getting trapped in the top row. Plan to move LEFT or RIGHT to access other apples.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements, but they are currently not an immediate threat.\n- Maintain flexibility by avoiding moves that limit future options (e.g., moving into a corner).\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- UP moves me directly onto the apple at (4, 9), which is the optimal move for immediate apple collection and growth.\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple Distances from (1, 7):**\nCalculate Manhattan distance to each apple:\n- (3, 1): |3-1| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n- (9, 7): |9-1| + |7-7| = 8 + 0 = 8\n- (0, 6): |0-1| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- (5, 0): |5-1| + |0-7| = 4 + 7 = 11\n- (7, 5): |7-1| + |5-7| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nClosest apple: (0, 6) at distance 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n1. **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n   - Moves me closer to (0, 6) (distance becomes |0-1| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1).\n   - Future moves from (1, 6): UP to (1, 7), DOWN to (1, 5), LEFT to (0, 6), RIGHT to (2, 6).\n   - Path to (0, 6) is clear: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6).\n   - Risk: None immediate. This is a strong move.\n\n2. **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n   - Moves me directly to the left edge. Distance to (0, 6) becomes |0-0| + |6-7| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n   - Future moves from (0, 7): UP to (0, 8), DOWN to (0, 6), LEFT (off the board), RIGHT to (1, 7).\n   - Path to (0, 6) is direct: (0, 7) \u2192 (0, 6).\n   - Risk: Moving LEFT traps me in the left edge, reducing future flexibility.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n   - Moves me away from (0, 6) (distance becomes |0-2| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3).\n   - Future moves from (2, 7): UP to (2, 8), DOWN to (2, 6), LEFT to (1, 7), RIGHT to (3, 7).\n   - Path to (0, 6) is less direct: (2, 7) \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6).\n   - Risk: Moving RIGHT is safe but less optimal than DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- DOWN and LEFT both move me closer to (0, 6), but DOWN keeps more future options open (e.g., moving RIGHT later if needed).\n- LEFT traps me in the left edge, which is risky long-term.\n- RIGHT is safe but moves me away from the closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize eating the closest apples: (0, 6) and then (3, 1) or (7, 5).\n- After eating (0, 6), plan to move DOWN to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 6) to avoid being trapped.\n- Avoid the left edge unless necessary. Maintain flexibility by keeping open paths.\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements, but they are not an immediate threat.\n- If the enemy snake moves toward me, reassess and prioritize survival.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- DOWN moves me closer to (0, 6) while keeping future options open. It is the optimal move.\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1, 6) \u2192 My body segment. Unsafe.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate Moves That Kill Me:**\n- LEFT is unsafe (off the board).\n- RIGHT is unsafe (into my body).\n- UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apple Collection:**\n- Neither UP nor DOWN immediately collect an apple.\n- Closest apples are (2, 5) and (3, 2). Moving UP or DOWN does not directly approach these, but we need to plan a path toward them.\n\n**Post-Move State Analysis:**\n1. **UP to (0, 7):**\n   - New head: (0, 7)\n   - Body: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n   - Future moves from (0, 7): UP to (0, 8), DOWN to (0, 6), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1, 7) (my body).\n   - Safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n   - This keeps me near the left edge but with limited flexibility.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 5):**\n   - New head: (0, 5)\n   - Body: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n   - Future moves from (0, 5): UP to (0, 6), DOWN to (0, 4), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1, 5).\n   - Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n   - This opens up more options, including moving RIGHT toward the center of the board and closer to apples like (2, 5) and (3, 2).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Enemy Snake's Possible Moves:**\nEnemy head at (7, 5). Possible moves:\n- UP: (7, 6) \u2192 Their body. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7, 4) \u2192 Empty.\n- LEFT: (6, 5) \u2192 Their body. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8, 5) \u2192 Empty.\n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- My possible moves are (0, 7) and (0, 5). Enemy moves are far from these. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-Term Strategy:**\n- Prioritize moving toward the closest apples: (2, 5) and (3, 2).\n- DOWN to (0, 5) is preferable because it opens up more future moves (RIGHT to (1, 5)), which can lead toward the center and closer to apples.\n- Avoid getting trapped in the left edge. Moving DOWN and then RIGHT is a better path to the apples.\n- Monitor the enemy snake's movements, but they are not an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Future Plan:**\n- Move DOWN to (0, 5) this turn.\n- Next turn, move RIGHT to (1, 5) to approach the apples at (2, 5) and (3, 2).\n- Continue moving toward the center to collect apples while maintaining flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- DOWN moves me to (0, 5), opening up more future options and setting up a path toward the apples at (2, 5) and (3, 2). This is the optimal move.\n\nDOWN",
