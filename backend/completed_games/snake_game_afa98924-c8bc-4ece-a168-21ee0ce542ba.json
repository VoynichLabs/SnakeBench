          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- My snake's head is at (6, 2), with the body at (7, 2). (Note: The initial description said head at (8, 2) and body at (7, 2); however, the recent position mentions the head at (6, 2). Assuming the last move was to the right from (5, 2) to (6, 2), and that my snake's position is at (6,2) with body at (7, 2).)\n\n- According to the previous move, I moved right, which means my head is now at (6, 2).\n\n- The closest apple to me currently is at (9, 2), which is to the right, along the same row, 3 steps away.\n\n- There are other apples at (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 6), and (6, 6). But reaching those would require longer navigation.\n\n- On the board, the apples are at positions:\n\n  - (9, 2): directly to the right, 3 moves away.\n\n  - (0, 4): far left and up.\n\n  - (0, 5): far left and up.\n\n  - (3, 6): closer diagonally but still a longer route.\n\n  - (6, 6): directly above my current position, two moves up.\n\n- The enemy snake is at (7, 8), which is two rows above, so no immediate threat below.\n\n- The cell at (7, 2) is where my body is, so moving right to (7, 2) would lead to collision with my body unless I plan to grow, which I can do if the apple is at my target.\n\n- The apple at (9, 2) is two cells to the right of (7, 2). Therefore, to reach it, I need to move right twice.\n\n- Since I have only one segment after the move, moving right again would be safe so far.\n\n- However, moving directly to (7, 2) again would cause a collision, as it's my body position, so I need to consider moving around.\n\n- Given that, moving up from (6, 2) would take me to (6, 3). From there, I could go right, then up again, or navigate toward the apple at (9, 2).\n\n- Alternatively, moving down isn't going to get me closer to apples.\n\n- Moving left would take me away from the nearest apple and isn't strategic.\n\n- Considering safety and efficiency, moving right seems to be the plan, but I need to make sure the next move doesn't lead to a collision.\n\n- Since the cell at (7, 2) contains my body, I shouldn't move right immediately unless I want to grow into my own body, which isn't beneficial.\n\n- Therefore, perhaps it's better to move upward to (6, 3), then plan toward the apple at (9, 2).\n\n- From (6,3), I can move right to (7,3), then to (8,3), and then up to (8,2), closer to the apple.\n\n- Alternatively, heading toward the apple at (6,6) could involve moving up twice, reaching (6,4), then (6,5), then (6,6), then back down.\n\n- But the apple at (6,6) seems more accessible by moving up from my current position.\n\n- Wait\u2014the apple at (6,6) is directly above at two steps away along the y-axis. Moving up twice from (6,2) would be (6,3), then (6,4), then (6,5), and finally (6,6). So three moves to reach it.\n\n- I want to maximize points now, so reaching an apple as soon as possible.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving upward seems flexible, safe, and aligned with my goal.\n\nNow, is moving UP safe? Are there hazards in that direction?\n\n- The cell (6, 3) is currently empty; no snake occupies there.\n\n- Moving upward wouldn't cause collisions with walls or other snakes.\n\nTherefore, moving up is safe and strategic to reach closer apples efficiently.\n\n**Next move**: UP",

The body is at (8, 3). So I am at (8, 4) now, with a body at (8, 3); that implies my snake is vertical, heading upward with length 2.\n\nNow, the apples are at (9, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 6), and (6, 6). My current position at (8, 4) is closer to the apple at (9, 2), but it\u2019s two steps away in the x-direction. Moving directly right from (8, 4) to (9, 4) is safe and would put me closer to the apple at (9, 2) in the subsequent move. \n\nMoving right now would be safe, provided (9, 4) is empty.

Moving left to (7, 4) seems safe, but less direct.\n\nMoving upward is not optimal because I am already at (8, 4), so moving UP would go to (8, 5). But perhaps moving right directly aligns better with the apple at (9, 2).\n\nNext, the safest and most efficient way to approach the apple at (9, 2) is to move right to (9, 4), then down to (9, 2). Moving there now would position me to reach the apple on the subsequent move.\n\nIn considering safety, I note that:\n\n- Moving right to (9, 4): safe, as no obstacles.\n- From (9, 4), moving down to (9, 3): safe, as that cell is empty.\n- Then moving down again to (9, 2): the apple is there; eating it would grow my snake.\n\nThus, my immediate next move should be RIGHT, to start heading toward the apple at (9, 2).
