Let me check what happens if it moves in each direction:\n- UP to (8, 4): Safe - this is an apple location\n- DOWN to (8, 2): This is its own body - **DEADLY** for it\n- LEFT to (7, 3): Safe - moves left into open space\n- RIGHT to (9, 3): Safe - moves right into open space\n\nSo the enemy snake #0 cannot move DOWN - it would die. It can only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. If it moves UP to (8, 4), it will collect the apple there.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (1, 5) and LEFT to (0, 6). Neither will immediately eat an apple, but I need to consider future positioning and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (2, 2) is relatively close to my current position at (1, 6). Moving DOWN to (1, 5) would position me closer to that apple and keep me on the left side of the board. Moving LEFT to (0, 6) would move me to the edge of the board, which could be risky in the long run.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is constrained to only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. If it moves UP to (8, 4), it will collect an apple and grow, making it more dangerous. I should be mindful of its potential movements but don't need to directly avoid it since we're on different parts of the board.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nAfter this move, I'll be at either (1, 5) or (0, 6). My snake will have 5 segments total. The remaining apples are at (5, 1), (8, 4), (2, 2), (6, 6), and (6, 3). I should continue being mindful of enemy snake #0's movements - it's currently at (8, 3) and can only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is deadly for it). The apple at (2, 2) is relatively close to my current position and should be a priority target. I should avoid getting trapped in tight spaces and keep multiple safe paths available. Moving DOWN to (1, 5) seems like the best immediate option as it brings me closer to the apple at (2, 2) while maintaining flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

It's safe but not very strategic.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 1)**: This moves me toward the apple at (5, 1), which is currently occupied by enemy snake #0's body at (5, 1). Moving down to (4, 1) positions me to potentially reach the apple if the enemy moves away. This seems like a good strategic move.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 2)**: This moves me back toward my own body. Looking at my body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)], my head is at (4, 2) and the next body segment is at (3, 2). Moving LEFT to (3, 2) would be moving into my own body - **DEADLY**.\n\nWait, let me recheck that. My head is at (4, 2) and my body is [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]. So (3, 2) is the first body segment. Moving LEFT to (3, 2) would indeed be moving into my own body - **DEADLY**.\n\nSo I actually have two safe moves: UP or DOWN.\n\n**Enemy movement considerations:**\nEnemy snake #0 at (6, 2) can move:\n- UP to (6, 3): Safe\n- DOWN to (6, 1): Safe\n- LEFT to (5, 2): Safe\n- RIGHT to (7, 2): Safe\n\nSo the enemy has four safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN to (4, 1)** is the most strategic move. It positions me to potentially reach the apple at (5, 1) if the enemy moves away, and it gives me more options for future moves.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nI'm moving DOWN to (4, 1) to position myself closer to the apple at (5, 1) and to maintain flexibility for future moves. The enemy snake #0 at (6, 2) can move UP to (6, 3), DOWN to (6, 1), LEFT to (5, 2), or RIGHT to (7, 2). I should be aware of its movements and plan my next move accordingly.

This is the best move as it gives me an immediate point.\n\n2. **LEFT to (0, 4)**: This moves me away from the apples and potentially further from the other apples. It's safe but not very strategic.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 4)**: This moves me away from the apple at (1, 5) and towards the right side. It's safe but not as strategic as moving up.\n\n**Enemy movement considerations:**\nEnemy snake #0 at (6, 6) can move:\n- UP to (6, 7): Safe\n- DOWN to (6, 5): Safe\n- LEFT to (5, 6): Safe\n- RIGHT to (7, 6): This is its own body at (7, 6) - **DEADLY**\n\nSo the enemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP to (1, 5)** is the best move as it directly collects the apple at (1, 5). This gives me an immediate point and is the most strategic choice.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 5), I'll have 6 apples total. I'm currently on the left side of the board. The remaining apples are at (8, 4), (8, 8), (4, 8), and (6, 6). I should consider moving towards the right side of the board to compete for those apples, but I need to be careful of the enemy snake which is currently at (6, 6) or moving nearby. I should avoid moving back DOWN to (1, 4) as that would be moving into my own body (backwards movement).\n\nUP",
