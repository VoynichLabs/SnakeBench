The best strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, which is (2, 5). Moving left first will bring the snake closer to the apple and also avoid any potential conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving left, I will move up to reach the apple at (2, 5).\n\nNext move: LEFT"
