Moving LEFT to (2, 1) then UP to (2, 2) gets me very close to it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the enemy snake's position. Snake #1 is at (2, 9) facing left, so it's moving toward the apples on the left side of the board as well. We're both competing for the apple at (2, 3).\n\nLooking at the board layout, if I move UP now to (3, 2), I can then move UP again to (3, 3) and be right next to the apple at (2, 3). This gives me good positioning and maintains flexibility.\n\n**Future flexibility analysis:**\n- From (3, 2): Can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (3 options)\n- From (2, 1): Can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (3 options)\n- From (3, 0): Can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (3 options)\n\nAll safe moves offer similar flexibility. Since the apple at (2, 3) is my primary target and moving UP positions me well for it while keeping options open, UP is my best choice.\n\nUP",

This is clear and safe. \u2705\n- **DOWN**: Would move to (2, 2). This is occupied by my own body segment. \u274c\n- **LEFT**: Would move to (1, 3). This is clear and safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: Would move to (3, 3). This is clear and safe. \u2705\n\n**Available moves:** UP, LEFT, or RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI just collected an apple last turn and now I'm tied with snake #1. Looking at the available apples:\n\n- (1, 8): 5 moves away (1 left, 4 up) - closest and reachable\n- (0, 7): 4 moves away (2 left, 1 up) - second closest\n- (8, 2): 10 moves away - quite far\n- (9, 9): 13 moves away - very far\n- (0, 0): 10 moves away - very far\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nSnake #1 at (0, 8) can reach (1, 8) in 1 move (RIGHT) and (0, 7) in 1 move (DOWN). This creates competition for these apples!\n\nIf I move LEFT toward (0, 7) or (1, 8), I risk a head-on collision with snake #1 who is also likely targeting those apples. Let me think about this carefully:\n\n- If I go LEFT, I'm moving toward (0, 7) or (1, 8)\n- Snake #1 can go RIGHT to (1, 8) or DOWN to (0, 7)\n\n**Safety consideration:** Moving toward the same apples as the enemy increases collision risk. Instead, I should consider moving toward less contested apples or positioning myself strategically.\n\n**RIGHT move analysis:**\n- Moves me toward (8, 2) apple\n- Away from immediate enemy competition\n- Gives me more space and options\n- Positions me in the center-right area where I have more room to maneuver\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI should avoid direct competition with snake #1 for the nearby apples (1, 8) and (0, 7) since they're equidistant or closer to the enemy. Instead, I'll move RIGHT to position myself for the (8, 2) apple or to circle around the board. This keeps me safe from immediate head-on collisions while maintaining flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Give me 1 more apple (tying with snake #1 at 5 apples each)\n2. Grow my snake by 1 segment (making my body longer which is strategically useful)\n3. Position me well to continue toward other apples\n\n**Future planning:**\nAfter collecting (8, 2), I'll be at (8, 2) with a longer body. From there I could:\n- Go UP toward (8, 7) apple\n- Go RIGHT then UP toward (9, 9) apple\n- Go DOWN then LEFT toward (4, 5) apple\n\n**Enemy considerations:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8), quite far from my position. They might move toward (8, 7) or (9, 9), but they can't reach (8, 2) before me.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the perfect move - it's safe, collects the closest apple, and helps me catch up in the scoring race.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is at (4, 4), which is 5 moves away from (9, 9), so I can easily reach it first.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nTo reach (9, 9) efficiently:\n- Option 1: UP to (8, 8), then RIGHT to (9, 8), then UP to (9, 9)\n- Option 2: RIGHT to (9, 7), then UP to (9, 8), then UP to (9, 9)\n\nBoth paths take 3 moves. However, moving UP first keeps me more centrally positioned and gives me better flexibility.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nMoving UP is safe - no immediate threats. The enemy snake is far away and can't reach me in time to interfere with collecting the (9, 9) apple.\n\n**Movement Plan:**\nMove UP toward (9, 9), then RIGHT, then UP to collect the apple. This will bring my score to 7 apples, tying with the enemy.\n\nUP",

This position is in my body list at index 0 (my neck). \u274c\n- **DOWN**: Would move to (7, 4). This position is not in my body list or any enemy body. \u2705\n- **LEFT**: Would move to (6, 5). This is clear and safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: Would move to (8, 5). This position is not in my body or enemy body. \u2705\n\n**Available safe moves:** DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nFrom my current position (7, 5):\n- If I move **DOWN** to (7, 4), I continue my path toward the apple at (7, 1), which is 3 more moves down. This maintains my direct trajectory to the nearest apple.\n- If I move **LEFT** to (6, 5), I'm diverting from the direct path but could potentially reach the apple at (5, 6) via: LEFT\u2192DOWN\u2192LEFT\u2192UP (4 moves total), or continue toward (7, 1) with a detour.\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (8, 5), I'm moving away from all apples and into a more crowded area near my tail.\n\n**Future Path Planning:**\nThe enemy is at (0, 1) and can easily reach (0, 2), but getting to (7, 1) would require a long journey across the board. I have a clear path advantage to (7, 1).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nAll three moves are safe. DOWN continues my established strategy toward the closest apple. LEFT offers an alternative route but with more complexity. RIGHT doesn't provide clear strategic value.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN continues my direct path toward the apple at (7, 1), maintaining momentum toward scoring and catching up to the enemy's lead.\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nAfter reaching (7, 4), I'll need to continue DOWN toward (7, 1). After eating that apple, consider targeting (9, 3) or (9, 6) by moving right along row 1 or 2, taking advantage of the space opening up as my tail moves away from the wall.\n\nDOWN",

This is critical because:\n  - It's the closest apple to me\n  - Getting this apple helps me catch up to the enemy's lead\n  - I'm already committed to this trajectory after last turn's move\n  \n- **LEFT** to (6, 3) would be safer in terms of avoiding the trajectory, but it wastes time and doesn't get me closer to the apple\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nMoving DOWN positions me at (7, 2), one step away from the apple at (7, 1). This is an optimal position. The enemy snake is far away on the left side, so it won't reach this apple before me.\n\n**Future Planning:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (7, 1), I'll need to plan my path toward the remaining apples. The apples at (9, 3) and (9, 6) look like good targets, accessible by moving right and then navigating upward. I should avoid getting trapped in the bottom-right corner.\n\nDOWN",

Now I need to strategize which is optimal.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nSince I'm behind by 4 apples, I need to focus on efficient apple collection. The apples at (5, 6) and (5, 7) are both 3 cells away and appear to be the most reachable.\n\n**Future Planning:**\nI should move toward the cluster of apples in the center-left area (around column 5) while maintaining safe positioning away from snake #1, who dominates the far left side.\n\nLEFT seems optimal because:\n- Moves me toward the apple cluster at (5, 6) and (5, 7)\n- Positions me to compete for the central apples\n- Maintains distance from snake #1 (who is at (1, 8) on the far left)\n- From (7, 6), I'll have good flexibility with UP, DOWN, and LEFT moves available next turn\n\nLEFT",

I can reach it in 2 turns: (4,9) then (5,9). The enemy head at (5,6) is too far to beat me to (5,9) (it would need at least 3 moves via y=7,8).\n- No immediate head-on collision or body collision if I go RIGHT this turn. After eating at (5,9) I can go down to (5,8) to avoid being stuck at the top edge.\n- Going RIGHT keeps momentum toward an easy apple and preserves multiple follow-up options (east then down). Going DOWN would risk drifting into my own clustered body on the left and slow apple capture.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT to take (5,9).

No enemy can reach (5,9) this turn.\n- DOWN is safe but concedes the easy top-row apple to the opponent (they are two moves away and could take it if I don't).\n- There is some risk after eating: if I then go DOWN into (5,8) while the enemy head moves UP into (5,8), that would be a head-on collision next turn. However, that would kill both on that turn and I would already hold a bigger apple count (16 vs 13), so that outcome still favors me. More likely the enemy will avoid a suicide, allowing me to move down safely or reroute.\n- No immediate self-collision or body-block issues for RIGHT.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Eat at (5,9) this turn.

That cell is survivable if the enemy vacates it this turn (which they must move to one of {UP,LEFT,RIGHT} because moving back into their neck is illegal). The enemy cannot move DOWN, so the only true head-on risk (both moving into the same cell) is low. Moving DOWN puts me closer to the lower apple cluster (closest apple at (5,3) is 5 steps away after this move vs 6 from moving RIGHT).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- DOWN has modest risk only if the opponent chooses a move that results in a head-on into the same target cell; given their neck, a direct head-on into the same cell is unlikely. DOWN gives better access to the high-value apples at y=2\u20133 and keeps more routes available than heading right into open top edge.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to approach the lower apple cluster.\n- On the following turn, observe enemy movement: if they move into my current square or into my intended path, avoid head-on by sidestepping (prefer RIGHT from (5,8) to (6,8) or LEFT to (4,8) depending on free space).\n- After securing a path, prioritize apples at (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)/(3,2) while avoiding getting trapped along x=0..2.\n\nDOWN",

This would be a head-on collision - both snakes die \u274c\n- **DOWN (5, 7)**: My own body segment - would cause death \u274c\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: Empty cell, appears safe \u2705\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: Empty cell, appears safe \u2705\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nBoth UP and DOWN are deadly moves, so I must choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nThe apple cluster at (3, 2), (4, 2), and (5, 2) is very attractive - 3 apples in close proximity. LEFT moves me toward this cluster while also getting me away from the dangerous snake #1 that's directly above me.\n\nRIGHT would move me toward the apple at (8, 5), but that's farther away and puts me in a more vulnerable position in the right side of the board.\n\n**Move Decision:**\nLEFT is the strategically superior choice because:\n1. It's safe (avoids both suicide and head-on collision)\n2. It positions me to collect the 3-apple cluster at the bottom\n3. It creates distance from snake #1\n4. It keeps me in good board position with multiple future options\n\nLEFT",
