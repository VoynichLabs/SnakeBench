UP: (5, 9) - This would move me to the top row. Checking the board, (5,9) is empty. This is safe.\n2. DOWN: (5, 7) - This would move me to an apple! This is safe and beneficial.\n3. LEFT: (4, 8) - This is empty and safe.\n4. RIGHT: (6, 8) - This is empty and safe.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- DOWN is the most attractive option as it would let me collect the apple at (5,7) immediately.\n- UP would put me near the top edge, which might limit future movement options.\n- LEFT and RIGHT are safe but don't provide immediate benefits.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- The enemy snake is far away at (4,1), so no immediate collision risk.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,7) is safe as it's currently empty and not occupied by any snake body.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best move is DOWN to collect the apple at (5,7).

Invalid.\n2. **DOWN (4,4)**: Safe move. Doesn't hit anything.\n3. **LEFT (3,5)**: Safe move. Doesn't hit anything.\n4. **RIGHT (5,5)**: Safe move. Doesn't hit anything.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- UP (4,6): Invalid move as it would hit your own body.\n- DOWN (4,4): Moves away from the closest apple at (4,7).\n- LEFT (3,5): Moves away from the closest apple at (4,7).\n- RIGHT (5,5): Moves away from the closest apple at (4,7).\n\n**Best Move:**\nSince UP is invalid and the other moves don't directly lead to an apple, the best option is to move UP to reach the apple at (4,7). However, since UP is invalid, we need to choose a safe move that sets us up for the next turn. RIGHT (5,5) is a safe move that keeps us flexible for future moves.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nAfter moving RIGHT, reassess the board for the next closest apple while avoiding the enemy snake and potential traps. Keep in mind that the enemy snake might move toward the apples as well.\n\nRIGHT",
