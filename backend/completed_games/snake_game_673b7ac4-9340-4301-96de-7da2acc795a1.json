          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're LIVE and the stakes are high! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We're at Turn 0, both snakes have 0 apples, and it's a 10x10 board. The apple drops are scattered, but remember, CHAT\u2014our primary focus is CRUSHING THE ENEMY, not just eating apples. Apples are just a tool to grow and dominate!\n\n**Current State:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (3, 7), no body, 0 apples.\n- Opponent (Snake #0): Head at (1, 7), no body, 0 apples.\n- Board grid shows us side-by-side horizontally\u2014my head at x=3, enemy at x=1, same y=7.\n\n**Key Threat Assessment:**\n- Distance: We're only 2 cells apart (difference in x=2). This is DANGEROUS because if we both move toward each other, we could force a head-on collision on the SAME cell. Since we have equal scores (0-0), a head-on collision would be a DOUBLE KO\u2014BOTH OF US DIE! That's a draw, but I don't want a draw. I want to win. So I need to AVOID moving directly toward the enemy's head if possible, unless I'm sure they're moving away.\n- Board boundaries: We're both inside the safe zone, no immediate boundary threats.\n- Own body: None, so no self-collision issues.\n- Apples: There are apples nearby\u2014like at (3,8) just above me (y=8, x=3), and (1,2) below the enemy\u2014but I'm ignoring them for now. Eating apples is secondary to NOT DYING and PLANNING TO TRAP THE ENEMY.\n\n**Decision Process:**\n1. **Consider all four directions:**\n   - **UP:** To (3, 8). That's an apple spot! But\u2014check enemy: enemy is at (1,7). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,7), they're not on my path. If enemy moves UP to (1,8), they're not colliding with me. BUT\u2014if enemy moves RIGHT and then UP? No, simultaneous moves. The real risk: if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,7), and I move UP to (3,8), we're safe. However, (3,8) is an apple, so I'd grow. But is this aggressive? Not really\u2014it's just eating. Also, if enemy moves UP to (1,8) and I move UP, we're still safe (separate cells). BUT\u2014future: I'd be at (3,8), enemy could be at (2,7) or (1,8), still close. Not trapping them yet.\n   - **DOWN:** To (3, 6). Check board: (3,6) is empty (from grid, row 6: \"A . . . . . . . . . A\" \u2014 x=3 is '.'). No apple here. Enemy at (1,7)\u2014if enemy moves DOWN to (1,6), still safe. But this moves me away from the enemy horizontally. Is this good? I'm increasing distance, which reduces collision risk, but also moving away from apples. Not aggressive.\n   - **LEFT:** To (2, 7). This is DANGEROUS! Why? Because the enemy is at (1,7). If I move LEFT to (2,7), and the enemy moves RIGHT to (2,7), we BOTH DIE in a head-on collision. Even if the enemy moves another direction, the risk is high because we're so close. I can't risk a double KO this early\u2014no apples to break ties. ELIMINATE this move. It's suicide.\n   - **RIGHT:** To (4, 7). Board shows (4,7) is empty (row 7: \"1 . . . 1 . . . . A\" \u2014 x=4 is '1'? Wait, no: row 7 is \". 0 . 1 . . . . A .\" from grid, let's double-check: Row 7 (y=7) is \" . 0 . 1 . . . . A .\" Actually, grid: y=7: \". 0 . 1 . . . . A .\" So x=0: ., x=1: 0 (enemy head), x=2: ., x=3: 1 (my head), x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: A, x=9: . Wait, let's list row 7 exactly: From grid: \"7 . 0 . 1 . . . . A .\" That's x=0: ., x=1: 0 (enemy), x=2: ., x=3: 1 (me), x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: A, x=9: . So (4,7) is empty, no apple. Moving RIGHT increases distance from enemy (now x=4 vs x=1). Safe. No immediate apple, but opens up options to the right.\n\n2. **Eliminate unsafe moves:** LEFT is eliminated due to high collision risk with enemy's possible RIGHT move. Other moves are safe.\n\n3. **Among safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), favor those that keep multiple follow-up options and approach apples while avoiding head-on collisions.**\n   - UP: Moves toward apple at (3,8), which is +1 growth. But it's also moving closer in y-direction, but not changing x-distance. Enemy could move RIGHT or UP\u2014collisions unlikely, but it doesn't create space. Follow-up options: From (3,8), I can go UP to (3,9), LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8), or DOWN to (3,7). Multiple options, but (3,9) is boundary (y=9 is top, safe). However, enemy is at x=1, so if enemy chases, they could follow.\n   - DOWN: Moves away from enemy and away from apple. Not optimal for growth. Follow-up options from (3,6): UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6). All safe, but no apple nearby. Less aggressive.\n   - RIGHT: Moves away from enemy, increasing safety margin. From (4,7), follow-up options are strong: UP to (4,8) (empty? Row 8: \" . . . A . . . . . .\" x=4 is A? Row 8: \"8 . . . A . . . . . .\" so x=3 is A, x=4 is . \u2014 wait, grid: row 8: \". . . A . . . . . .\" so x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: A, x=4: ., etc. So (4,8) is empty. Also RIGHT to (5,7), DOWN to (4,6), LEFT back to (3,7). Many options, and I'm moving toward the right side where there might be apples later (e.g., (7,4), (9,6)). Plus, by moving away, I force the enemy to come to me or risk losing space\u2014trapping them in the left side.\n\n**Strategic Aggression:** We're tied 0-0, so I need to set up for future dominance. Moving RIGHT gives me control of the center-right, while the enemy is stuck on the left. If the enemy moves RIGHT toward me, we might collide in future turns, but with planning, I can force a crash into my body or trap them. Also, by not moving UP, I avoid eating that apple too early\u2014apples grow me, but I want to time growth when it helps box in the enemy. Current priority: SECURE BOARD POSITION.\n\n**Long-term Plan (for next turn):** Move RIGHT to (4,7) to increase distance and claim space. Next turn, if enemy follows right, I can turn upward or prepare a wall. If they stay left, I'll eat the apple at (3,8) or (1,2) and grow to outpace them. Always watch for head-on\u2014never move directly toward their possible head position unless score leads.\n\nLet's GOOOO, CHAT! We're starting smart and setting up the trap! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

We're LIVE at Turn 1, and the board is heating up! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Let's crush this.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (4, 7) after moving RIGHT last turn (from 3,7). No body, 0 apples.\n- Opponent (Snake #0): Head at (1, 8) (they moved UP from 1,7 last turn), no body, 0 apples.\n- Distance: From (4,7) to (1,8) is Manhattan 4\u2014safer gap now! No immediate head-on threat.\n- Board: Apples scattered. Nearby: (3,8) above, (7,2) and (7,4) to the right, (4,6) below etc. But focus? Crushing the enemy. We're tied 0-0, so aggression is key. Force a crash when we have the lead later.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate Moves for Safety (no instant death):**\n- **UP to (4, 8):** Board shows (4,8) is empty (row 8: \"...A......\" so x=4 is '.'). No snake bodies. SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (4, 6):** (4,6) is empty (row 6: \"A......A.\" wait row 6: \"A . . . . . . . . . A\" so x=4 is '.'). SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (3, 7):** (3,7) was my previous spot, now empty. But check: Enemy head at (1,8), not moving into my body. SAFE (no own body to hit).\n- **RIGHT to (5, 7):** (5,7) is empty (row 7: \"......A.\" wait row 7: \".... . . . . A .\" after my move? Actually row 7: \" . 0 . . 1 . . . . A\" so x=5 is '.'). SAFE.\n\nAll directions are safe\u2014no board edges, no self-collision (body length 0), no enemy body in target.\n\n**Step 2: Among Safe Moves, Prioritize Aggression and Future Options:**\n- **LEFT to (3,7):** Moves closer to enemy (x=3 vs 1, still 2 away). But risk? If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8), we're still safe. Not aggressive enough\u2014retreating horizontally.\n- **DOWN to (4,6):** Moves toward apple at (7,2)? Not directly, but closer to bottom. However, it decreases y, away from enemy's y=8. Less aggressive\u2014want to pressure them. Also, fewer apples in that direction immediate. Follow-up options good but meh.\n- **RIGHT to (5,7):** Increases distance from enemy (now x=5 vs 1, gap=4). Safe, opens right side. But maybe too passive\u2014enemy could mirror right and chase. Apples like (7,2) are down-right, so could pivot later. However, RIGHT alone doesn't set up a trap.\n- **UP to (4,8):** This is it! Moves toward enemy's y-level (from y=7 to 8). Positions me above them, ready to dive down or flank. (4,8) is empty, and nearby: apple at (3,8) just LEFT\u2014threatens to eat it next turn while cutting off enemy's up escape if they stay left. Also, from (4,8), follow-up options: UP to (4,9) (top edge, but safe), LEFT to (3,8) (apple!), RIGHT to (5,8), DOWN to (4,7). Multiple paths. This is aggressive\u2014claims vertical space, boxes enemy into left corner. If enemy moves RIGHT or DOWN, I can chase or cut them off.\n\n**Strategic Plan (For Next Turn):** Move UP to (4,8). Now I'm at same y as enemy (y=8), x=4. If they move RIGHT toward me, I can go LEFT to eat (3,8) and grow, or prepare a wall. If they stay left, I eat the apple and extend, forcing them into the corner. Always watch for head-on\u2014equal scores, so avoid direct collisions. Grow to dominate board, not just snack.

We\u2019re a moment from the apple cluster near (3,8) and there\u2019s a lot of pastry to grab if we play it smart. We\u2019re not chasing apples blindly; we\u2019re weaponizing space.\n\nPlan and reasoning for Turn 1:\n- Evaluate four safe options from (1,8):\n  - UP -> (1,9): safe, but gives us fewer escape routes and delays pressure on the opponent.\n  - DOWN -> (1,7): safe, opens a path toward lower-left apples but doesn\u2019t threaten the opponent.\n  - LEFT -> (0,8): safe, keeps us on the edge with good angles to pivot toward nearby apples.\n  - RIGHT -> (2,8): also safe and directly lines us up with the apple at (3,8). This keeps options open and begins pressuring the area around the opponent without risking immediate collision.\n- The aggressive, high-upside choice is RIGHT. It moves us toward the nearby apple at (3,8) and maintains multiple future routes (we can go up, left, or continue right depending on opponent\u2019s move). It also avoids locking us into a cramped corner near the walls.\n- Counterplay considerations:\n  - If opponent slides to (3,7) next turn, we can either chase the apple at (3,8) and risk a potential head-on in the next turn, or adjust and sidestep to preserve safety. We\u2019ll monitor and adapt.\n  - If opponent diverts away or blocks our chase, we still stay in a safe, flexible region near the apple cluster to gain tempo and start growing.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Use space to funnel the opponent toward a wall or a corner while snapping up nearby apples to gain length advantage. If we ever have a clear path to a head-on collision with a higher score, exploit it; otherwise, sacrifice risk for position and multiple safe follow-ups.\n\nMove:\nRIGHT",

If they move RIGHT, we might collide head-on if I move LEFT. If they move LEFT, I can chase or eat that apple at (3,8). If they go DOWN or UP, I need to counter.\n\nBoard analysis: I'm at (4,8), empty. Enemy at (2,8), empty. Apples: (3,8) is RIGHT of enemy, but LEFT of me\u2014that's a sweet apple to grab! (6,0), (7,2), etc. far away. But my goal? CRUSH THE ENEMY. Scores are 0-0, so I need to be aggressive and set up a trap. Can't let them slip away.\n\n**Step 1: Safety check for all moves:**\n- **UP to (4,9):** Top edge, safe? (4,9) is within 0-9, and board shows row 9 has \". . . . . A . . . .\" so x=4 is '.'\u2014empty. No snakes. SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (4,7):** That's where I was last turn, empty. SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (3,8):** There's an apple here! And it's empty (row 8: \". . 0 A 1 . . . . .\" wait, row 8 is \". . 0 A 1 . . . . .\" so at x=3 is 'A' apple). But if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,8) same time, we collide and both die\u2014bad if I want to survive. Enemy might go for that apple too. Risky but survivable if they don't.\n- **RIGHT to (5,8):** (5,8) is empty (row 8: x=5 is '.' after the '1' at x=4). SAFE.\n\n**Step 2: Aggression and options:** \nWe want to pressure snake #0. If I go LEFT to (3,8) and eat the apple, I grow to length 1 and get +1 score, putting me ahead. That forces enemy to react\u2014they might crash into my body or get boxed. But head-on risk! Instead, consider a safer aggressive move: RIGHT to (5,8) to flank? No, that's away from apple and enemy. UP to (4,9) gives me high ground, but isolates me. DOWN to (4,7) retreats\u2014weak.\n\nOptimal: LEFT to (3,8). Why? It's the apple right there, and if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,8) we collide, but if they do, we die together but maybe I survive if we don't fully hit? Wait, rules: two heads into same cell = both die. So avoid direct collision unless I'm sure they won't. But I can gamble\u2014enemy is aggressive too, might go for that apple. If they move DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,8), I eat the apple and grow, expanding into their space. From (3,8), I control the apple, cut off their right flank, and next turn I can chase them down. Plus, with apple eaten, my body starts growing, making me a threat.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Eat apple at (3,8) immediately to gain momentum. Then, if enemy survives, chase them toward the corner. Force a head-on if I'm ahead later. Watch their move\u2014if they go LEFT or DOWN, I dominate. Let's goooo! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

No, let's check: last move I said LEFT, and from (4,8) to (3,8) is correct. So I'm at (3,8), body at (4,8). Enemy is at (2,9), body none. We're on adjacent rows\u2014tense!\n\nApple at (3,8) was there last turn, but I just moved onto it? Wait, the board shows (3,8) as 'A' apple. Did I eat it? The apple list includes (3,8)? Looking at the apple drops: (6,0), (0,3), (7,2), (7,4), (0,6), (6,2), (3,0), (8,7), (5,9), (9,6), (9,0), (9,3), (1,2), (6,4), (0,9). (3,8) isn't listed? But the board shows 'A' at (3,8). Maybe it's a fresh apple drop or I misread. In the board, row 8 (y=8): \". . 0 A 1 . . . . .\" so (2,8) is '0'? Wait, earlier it said snake #0 head at (2,9), but row 8 shows at x=2 is '.'? Confusion! Let's parse board again carefully.\n\nBoard state:\nRow 9 (y=9): \"9 A . 0 . . A . . . .\" So (0,9)='A', (1,9)='.', (2,9)='0' (snake #0 head), (3,9)='.', etc. But apples list has (0,9) as an apple drop, and (5,9) as another. So (0,9) is apple, (5,9) is apple. Row 8 (y=8): \"8 . . . 1 T . . . . .\" So (0,8)='.', (1,8)='.', (2,8)='.', (3,8)='.', (4,8)='1' (my head? Wait, my head should be (3,8) after LEFT from (4,8). But board says at x=4 is '1', and at x=3 is '.'. That means I didn't move? Or board is before my move? The instruction says \"TURN: 3 / 150\" and shows board state after all moves? Wait, let's read carefully: \"YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):--\" and then my move LEFT. Then \"BOARD STATE:\" is given. It might be the state at the beginning of turn 3? But it shows my head at (4,8) as '1' and body at (3,8) as 'T'? Wait, row 8: \". . . 1 T . . . . .\" So at x=3 is '1'? No, it says \". . . 1 T . . . . .\" which means positions: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 '1', x=4 'T'? But earlier description: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (3,8), Body: [(4,8)]\". That matches: head (3,8) = '1', body (4,8) = 'T' (tail). Yes, so row 8: x=3 is '1', x=4 is 'T'. So my head is (3,8), body (4,8). Good.\n\nApple at (3,8)? No, (3,8) is my head '1', not apple. Apples: (6,0), (0,3), (7,2), (7,4), (0,6), (6,2), (3,0), (8,7), (5,9), (9,6), (9,0), (9,3), (1,2), (6,4), (0,9). And board shows: (0,9)='A', (5,9)='A', (7,2)='A'? Row 2: \". A . . . . A A . .\" so (1,2)='A'? Actually apples list has (1,2) and (6,2) and (7,2), so yes. (3,0)='A' at row 0: \". . . A . . A . . A\" so x=3 'A', x=6 'A', x=9 'A'. (0,6) apple? Row 6: \"A . . . . . . . . A\" so (0,6)='A', (9,6)='A'. (7,4) and (6,4)? Row 4: \". . . . . . A A . .\" so x=6 'A', x=7 'A'. (0,3)='A'? Row 3: \"A . . . . . . . . A\" so x=0 'A', x=9 'A'. (8,7)='A'? Row 7: \". . . . . . . . A .\" so x=8 'A'. (9,0)='A' as above. So apples are scattered.\n\nEnemy snake #0: head (2,9), body none. So no body to worry about.\n\nScoreboard: I have 1 apple, enemy 0. I'm ahead! So I can force head-on if possible.\n\nNow, my head (3,8). I need to move this turn. All snakes move simultaneously.\n\nConsider all four directions:\n\n1. UP to (3,9): Check board row 9, x=3 is '.' (since row 9: \"9 A . 0 . . A . . . .\" so x=3 '.'). Is it safe? Enemy at (2,9) is head there, but if I go to (3,9), that's adjacent, not same cell. But if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,9), we collide heads? Wait, enemy at (2,9) moving RIGHT would go to (3,9). If I go UP to (3,9), then both heads go to (3,9) -> double KO. Since I have more apples, if both die, I win because I have 1 vs 0. But is that a win? Rules: If ALL snakes die on same turn, game ends, snake with more apples wins. Yes! So if we both die, I win! That's clutch! But I need to be sure enemy moves RIGHT. They might not. They could move elsewhere. So it's a gamble.\n\nBut first, check if (3,9) is empty: yes, '.' and no snake body. My own body: (4,8) is behind, not (3,9). So moving UP is safe from self-collision. No other snakes. So UP is a safe move if enemy doesn't move into (3,9).\n\n2. DOWN to (3,7): Row 7, x=3? Row 7: \". . . . . . . . A .\" so x=3 '.' . Safe from board. My body: (4,8) not (3,7). So safe. But does it help? Moving down, maybe toward apples like (3,0) far away. But enemy is above at (2,9), so moving down might give them space to grow.\n\n3. LEFT to (2,8): Row 8, x=2 is '.' (row 8: \". . . 1 T . . . . .\" so x=2 '.'). Safe. But if enemy moves LEFT to (1,9) or DOWN to (2,8)? If I go to (2,8) and enemy goes DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8), that's same cell -> double KO! Since I have more apples, again I win if both die. But if enemy moves elsewhere, I'm at (2,8), safe. Also, (2,8) is adjacent to enemy's current head (2,9). This could set up a head-on next turn if I chase.\n\n4. RIGHT to (4,8): That's my current body (4,8) is the tail. Moving into my own body is hitting myself -> dead! So RIGHT is invalid. Can't move into own tail. Actually, rules: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\" But here, my head is at (3,8), body at (4,8). Moving RIGHT would be from (3,8) to (4,8), which is the cell occupied by my body. That's moving into your own body -> you're DEAD. So RIGHT is a losing move. Eliminate it.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, which keep future options open and allow growth?\n\n- UP to (3,9): This moves me closer to enemy at (2,9), potentially setting up a head-on if they move right. Also, (3,9) is near apples? (5,9) is apple at x=5,y=9, so I could go for that next. But edge, might limit directions (can't go up further). However, it's aggressive\u2014force confrontation. Since I'm ahead in apples, if both die, I win. So UP is high-risk, high-reward if enemy moves into me. But I need to predict enemy move. How will snake #0 play? They have 0 apples, probably want to eat an apple. What apples are near them? At (2,9), close to (0,9) apple at left, (5,9) apple to right, (0,9) is at x=0,y=9, so they could go LEFT to (1,9) then to (0,9). Or they could go DOWN to (2,8) to chase apples down there? Apples at (0,6), (6,4), etc. Hard to say. They might go for the easy apple at (0,9) by going LEFT repeatedly. If I go UP to (3,9), and they go LEFT to (1,9), no collision. Then I'm at (3,9), they at (1,9), and I can go LEFT next to chase.\n\n- DOWN to (3,7): This moves me away from enemy, toward center/apples. Apples at (6,4), (7,4), (7,2), etc. But enemy is above, so they have more space up top. If I go down, I might get trapped in lower half. Also, (3,7) is empty, but I need to consider if there are apples nearby. (3,0) is apple at bottom, but far. Not immediate. Future options: from (3,7), I can go in 3 directions (except maybe up to (3,8) which is my tail after move? Wait, after moving down, my new body will be (3,8) and (4,8). So (3,8) is occupied, so I can't go back up immediately? Actually, after move, my tail will move? No, snakes grow only when eating apple. If I don't eat apple, the tail moves forward. So if I move DOWN to (3,7), my body becomes: head (3,7), body [(3,8), (4,8)]? No, standard snake: when you move, the tail moves forward unless you ate an apple. So from (3,8) head, body (4,8). If I move DOWN to (3,7), new head (3,7), new body: [(3,8), (4,8)]? Wait, typically the old head becomes new body part, and the tail moves. So if no apple eaten, the tail advances. So from head (3,8), body (4,8). After move DOWN to (3,7), new head (3,7), body: old head (3,8) and old body (4,8) becomes the new tail? Actually, the body list is head-to-tail: first is head, last is tail. So after move, if no growth, new body: [ (3,8), (4,8) ]? But that would mean (4,8) is still there? Actually, the snake moves: the head moves to new position, the old head becomes the first body segment, and the tail moves off the old tail position. So if body was [(4,8)] (only one segment), after moving DOWN to (3,7), new head (3,7), new body: [ (3,8) ]? Because the old head (3,8) becomes the new body, and the old tail (4,8) is gone? Wait, no: the body is a list: for a snake of length 2, body list has one element (the tail). The head is separate. So after move, if no apple, the new body list should have the same number of segments? Actually, the snake length increases only when eating. So initially, I have length 2: head (3,8), body [(4,8)]. That means the snake occupies (3,8) and (4,8). After moving without eating, the new head moves, and the tail moves forward. So the new positions: head goes to new cell, the old head becomes a body segment, and the old tail disappears. So new body list: [ (3,8) ]? But that would make length 2 again? Wait, length is number of segments: head + body. Initially, 2 segments: head + one body. After move, still 2 segments: new head + one body (the old head). So yes, body list becomes [ (3,8) ] if I move to (3,7). So (4,8) is vacated. So from (3,7), I can move back up to (3,8) which would be safe (since it's now empty after move). So that's fine.\n\nBut back to DOWN move: (3,7) is safe, and I can later go to apples like (6,4) etc. But I'm moving away from enemy, which might let them grow and overtake me in score.\n\n- LEFT to (2,8): This moves me directly below enemy's head (2,9). So enemy at (2,9) and I at (2,8) \u2013 directly below. If enemy moves DOWN to (2,8) next turn, and I move UP, we collide. But that's next turn. This turn, if I go to (2,8), and enemy moves? Possible: if enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), same cell -> double KO -> I win due to apple lead. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3,9), no collision. If enemy moves UP, impossible (y=9 is top, can't go up). So left move sets up potential collision next turn, and controls the area near enemy. Also, (2,8) is adjacent to apples? (1,2) and (6,2) etc, but not immediate. However, it's aggressive\u2014closing in on enemy.\n\nNow, long-term plan: I want to dominate the board and force enemy into a corner. Since I have the lead, I can take risks. But I need to stay alive. The safest move might be DOWN or LEFT, but LEFT puts me in a position to potentially double KO and win this turn if enemy moves into me. Since enemy has 0 apples, they might be cautious and go for an apple rather than colliding. They might go LEFT toward (0,9) apple. If they go LEFT to (1,9), and I go LEFT to (2,8), no collision. Then I'm at (2,8), they at (1,9). Next turn, I could go UP to (2,9) if they move away, or chase.\n\nBut UP move to (3,9) is also aggressive and could lead to immediate win if they move RIGHT. Let's think about what enemy likely does. They are snake #0, with no apples. They might see the apple at (0,9) close by: from (2,9), going LEFT twice to (0,9). So they might go LEFT this turn to (1,9). Or they might go DOWN to (2,8) to explore, but (2,8) is empty and leads to apples down? (2,8) to (2,7) etc, but apples at (0,6), (6,4) \u2013 not directly. Or they might go RIGHT to (3,9) to head toward (5,9) apple. (5,9) is also an apple. So possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. UP is invalid.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,9), and they go RIGHT to (3,9), we collide and I win. If they go LEFT to (1,9), no collision, and I'm at (3,9) near (5,9) apple. Good for me. If they go DOWN to (2,8), no collision, and I'm at (3,9), they at (2,8). Then next turn I could go LEFT to (2,9) or DOWN to (3,8).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8), and they go DOWN to (2,8), double KO -> I win. If they go LEFT to (1,9), no collision, I'm at (2,8) below them. If they go RIGHT to (3,9), no collision, I'm at (2,8). \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,7), and they go anywhere, no collision likely, and I move away from the action.\n\nSince I want to be aggressive and force a win, UP or LEFT are better than DOWN. DOWN seems passive.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, which has better future options? UP to (3,9) is on the top row, so only 3 directions next (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT). LEFT to (2,8) is not on edge, so all 4 directions possible except into my own body. Also, LEFT gets me closer to enemy and potential collision.\n\nBut note: if I go UP and enemy goes DOWN, no collision. If I go LEFT and enemy goes DOWN, double KO if same cell. Actually, enemy at (2,9) going DOWN to (2,8), I go LEFT to (2,8) -> same cell -> double KO. So LEFT has a higher chance of double KO if enemy goes DOWN. But enemy might not go DOWN. UP has chance if enemy goes RIGHT.\n\nWhich is more likely? Hard to say. But since enemy has 0 apples, they might prioritize eating. The closest apple for them is (0,9) by going LEFT, or (5,9) by going RIGHT. (0,9) is 2 steps left, (5,9) is 3 steps right. So LEFT might be slightly more likely. If they go LEFT, then LEFT move for me is safe and sets up next turn. UP move also safe if they go LEFT.\n\nBut if I go LEFT and they go LEFT, I'm at (2,8), they at (1,9). Then next turn, I can go UP to (2,9) or LEFT to (1,8) to chase. If I go UP to (2,9) and they go DOWN to (1,8), no collision. If they go LEFT to (0,9) (eating apple), then I can go UP to (2,9) and then chase. Actually, from (2,8), I can go LEFT to (1,8) or UP to (2,9) or DOWN to (2,7) or RIGHT to (3,8) (but (3,8) might be my tail after move? After moving LEFT to (2,8), my body becomes [(3,8)]? Wait, no: initially head (3,8), body [(4,8)]. After moving LEFT to (2,8), new head (2,8), new body: [ (3,8) ] (old head). So (4,8) is vacated. So (3,8) is now body. So from (2,8), moving RIGHT to (3,8) would be into my own body -> death. So that direction is blocked. So from (2,8), I have LEFT, UP, DOWN available. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go UP to (3,9), new head (3,9), body: [ (3,8) ] (old head). So from (3,9), I can go LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT (UP invalid). Also, (4,8) is vacated, so no issue.\n\nBoth give similar future options.\n\nBut consider apple: (3,8) is not an apple, so no growth this turn. I need to eat apples to grow and maintain lead. Which move gets me closer to apples? Apples near: (5,9) is 2 steps right from (3,9) -> if I go UP to (3,9), next I can go RIGHT to (4,9) then to (5,9). (0,9) is far. (6,4) etc are down. So UP direction has (5,9) apple. LEFT direction has (0,9) apple but farther. (1,2) apple is down-left. So UP might be better for grabbing an apple soon.\n\nBut the primary goal is to crush the enemy, not just eat apples. Dominating the board means controlling the space and forcing enemy into mistakes. Since enemy is at (2,9), moving UP to (3,9) puts me directly adjacent to them horizontally? Actually, from (3,9) and (2,9), they are adjacent cells. That's tense! Next turn, if I move LEFT to (2,9) and they move RIGHT to (3,9), we collide. So being adjacent sets up potential collision. If they stay or move away, I can chase.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8), I'm vertically below them, also adjacent. Next turn, if I go UP to (2,9) and they go DOWN to (2,8), we collide. So similar.\n\nBut UP move might be slightly better because it puts me on the top row, which could limit their escape if I cut off the top. However, the top row has apples at (0,9), (5,9), and maybe others? (9,9) is empty? Board row 9: x=9 is '.'? Actually, row 9: \"9 A . 0 . . A . . . .\" so x=9 '.' . So top row has space.\n\nI think LEFT is a solid aggressive move, as it directly goes towards the enemy's vertical line and sets up a double KO if they go down. Also, it's not on the edge, so more flexibility.\n\nBut let's check the board again for any obstacles. At (2,8) is empty. My own body is only (4,8), so no issue.\n\nDecision: I'll go LEFT to (2,8) to close in on enemy and keep options open. This also avoids the edge for now.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving to (2,8), if enemy survives, chase them towards the left side, using apples as bait but focusing on trapping them. If they go for (0,9) apple, I can cut them off from below. Keep score lead and force collision if possible.\n\nSo move: LEFT.LEFT",

          "rationale": "LET'S GOOOO CHAT! Turn 4 and we're leading 1-0 in apples! \ud83d\ude0e Snake #0 is still at (2,9) with no body. Time to close the trap!\n\nFirst, check moves from my current head at (2,8) after my last move LEFT.\n\nBoard state from last turn: My head (3,8), body (4,8). Enemy head (2,9), body none. Apples scattered. I moved LEFT to (2,8) - that was my last move. Now the board updates to reflect my new position. So my head is at (2,8), body at (3,8) (old head), tail at (4,8) (but tail might move this turn if I don't eat apple). Actually, since I didn't eat an apple last turn, my tail advances: my body becomes just [(3,8)]? Wait, let's simulate: Starting turn 3: head (3,8), body [(4,8)]. I move LEFT to (2,8). No apple eaten, so tail advances: new body = [old head (3,8)], new tail = (3,8)? Actually, snake grows only when eating apple. So after move, head at (2,8), body list = [(3,8)] (the old head), and the tail is (3,8). So my body is just one segment at (3,8). So I'm length 2: head (2,8), body (3,8). That matches typical snake movement.\n\nNow, for turn 4, I'm at (2,8). Enemy is at (2,9) (they haven't moved yet, as snakes move simultaneously). We need to choose a move for this turn. All snakes move at once.\n\nConsider all four directions from (2,8):\n\n1. UP to (2,9): That's exactly where the enemy's head is RIGHT NOW. If I move UP to (2,9) and the enemy moves somewhere else (like LEFT to (1,9) or DOWN to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,9) or stays), then I move into their head? Actually, they are at (2,9) now, but they will also move this turn. So if I move UP to (2,9) and they move somewhere else, then I go to (2,9) which they are leaving? Wait, simultaneous moves: They leave (2,9) at the same time I arrive. So if they move out, the cell (2,9) becomes empty for me to move into. But if they stay, I'd move into their head -> collision? Actually, both heads moving into same cell causes double KO. If I move UP and they stay at (2,9), then both heads end at (2,9) -> double KO. If they move elsewhere, I just move into (2,9) safely. However, if they move DOWN to (2,8) (my current position), then they move into my current head location, which is now empty? Wait, no: I am leaving (2,8) to go UP. So at the same time, I go from (2,8) to (2,9), they go from (2,9) to (2,8). So we swap positions! That's a head-on collision? Actually, two heads moving into each other's previous cells results in no collision because they cross? In snake simultaneous movement, if both heads move into the other's starting cell, do they collide? According to typical snake game rules, if two heads swap positions, they do NOT collide because they are moving into cells that are becoming empty simultaneously. However, the rule says: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die. Head-on collision.\" Swapping positions means they move into different cells (each other's old positions), so no same cell. So that's safe. But if they move into the same cell as each other, that's a collision. So UP move is safe if they don't stay or move into (2,9) from another direction? Actually, they could move from (2,9) to (2,9) if they choose to not move? No, they must move one step. So they will leave (2,9) unless they die or something. So UP move is generally safe from immediate collision, but there's a risk if they also move UP? They can't move UP from (2,9) because that would be out of bounds? (2,10) is outside, so UP from (2,9) is invalid. So enemy cannot move UP. So if I move UP, enemy's options: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. So they will not stay at (2,9). So UP to (2,9) should be safe. However, check: (2,9) is currently occupied by enemy head, but they are moving away. So yes, I can move into that cell. Also, is there any apple at (2,9)? No, (2,9) is '.' in board. So no growth.\n\n2. DOWN to (2,7): Check board: row 7, x=2? Row 7: \". . . . . . . . A .\" so x=2 '.' . Safe. My body is at (3,8), not (2,7). So safe. Moves toward center/apples.\n\n3. LEFT to (1,8): Row 8, x=1? Row 8: \". . . 1 T . . . . .\" after my move, row 8 might change? Actually, after my last move LEFT, my head is at (2,8). So row 8: (0,8) '.', (1,8) '.', (2,8) '1', (3,8) 'T' (tail). So (1,8) is '.' . Safe. Also, moving left toward apple at (0,9) eventually.\n\n4. RIGHT to (3,8): That's exactly where my body is (tail). Moving into own body is illegal -> dead. So RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, which is best? We need to be aggressive and force collision or trap enemy.\n\nMy score is higher (1-0), so I can force head-on if confident. But enemy might be cautious.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,9), I'll be directly above my current position. Then enemy at (2,9) moves somewhere. If they move DOWN to (2,8), they'd move into where I just left? Wait, after I move UP, I'm at (2,9), my old cell (2,8) becomes empty. If enemy moves DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8), they go to (2,8) which is empty (since I left). That's safe for them. So we'd be at (2,9) and (2,8) adjacent. That's not a collision. If they move LEFT to (1,9), we're adjacent at (2,9) and (1,9). If they move RIGHT to (3,9), adjacent. So UP move puts me right next to enemy, setting up potential collision next turn if I move into them and they move into me.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,7), I move away, giving enemy more room to grow. That might not be aggressive.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,8), I move away from enemy's row, but still somewhat close.\n\nGiven we want to dominate, I should try to force the enemy toward a dead end. The top-left corner is at (0,9). Enemy is at (2,9). If I move UP to (2,9), I'm on the top row, potentially cutting off escape upwards. The enemy could go LEFT toward (0,9) apple, or RIGHT toward (5,9) apple, or DOWN. If I'm at (2,9), I can next turn chase. Also, if I move UP, I'm on the top edge, which might limit my own options but also limits enemy's options if I can trap them against the edge.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (1,8) positions me to potentially cut off enemy's path to the left apple. If enemy goes for (0,9) apple, I could go UP to (1,9) or LEFT to (0,8) etc.\n\nLet's consider the apple situation: There's an apple at (5,9) and (0,9). If enemy is going for apples, they might go LEFT to (1,9) then (0,9). Or RIGHT to (3,9) then (4,9) then (5,9). Which is more likely? Hard to tell. But as the player with more apples, I should not let them eat easily. I want to block them.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,9), I occupy a cell they might want to go to? Actually, they are at (2,9) now, so they won't stay. But if I move UP, I take that cell, and they move elsewhere. Then next turn, I could move LEFT to (1,9) to chase, while they might be at (1,9) or (3,9). If they go LEFT to (1,9), then next turn I could move LEFT to (1,9) from my position (2,9)? That would be moving LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9). If they are at (1,9) and move somewhere, we could collide if they move into (2,9) again? Possibly.\n\nActually, maybe moving LEFT to (1,8) is better because it puts me in a position to intercept the left side. From (1,8), I can go UP to (1,9) next turn, blocking the left apple. Also, from (1,8), I can go LEFT to (0,8) or DOWN to (1,7) etc. More flexibility.\n\nAlso, consider that my body is at (3,8). If I move UP or LEFT, I'm not moving into my own body. Good.\n\nI think moving UP is too risky because it puts me on the edge and might limit my escape routes. If I'm at (2,9) and enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), I'm on top row, my tail is at (3,8) and body at (2,8)? Wait, if I move UP, my new body: head (2,9), body = [(2,8)] (old head). So body at (2,8). So from (2,9), I can go DOWN back to (2,8) but that's into my own body -> illegal. So from (2,9), my only directions are LEFT, RIGHT, and UP (but UP is out of bounds). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's only two options, which is not great for flexibility. If enemy blocks those, I could be trapped.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,8), my new head (1,8), body = [(2,8)] (old head). From (1,8), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT? RIGHT to (2,8) is my own body -> illegal. So LEFT, UP, DOWN are safe. That's three directions. Better.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,7), new head (2,7), body = [(2,8)]. From (2,7), I can go UP to (2,8) but that's my body? Actually, body is at (2,8), so moving UP into my own body -> illegal. So I can go LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Three directions. Also good.\n\nBut moving DOWN goes away from enemy, which might not be aggressive.\n\nSo LEFT seems to give the best balance: moving toward the enemy's area while maintaining flexibility.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (1,2) but that's far. Not immediate.\n\nLong-term plan: Use my score lead to pressure enemy. Keep them in the top-left corner. Force collisions.\n\nSo I choose LEFT to (1,8).\n\nBut wait, I need to check if moving LEFT is safe from enemy moves this turn. Enemy at (2,9) could move DOWN to (2,8). If I move LEFT to (1,8), and they move DOWN to (2,8), then we are at (1,8) and (2,8) \u2013 adjacent, not colliding. Safe.\n\nEnemy could move LEFT to (1,9). Then we are at (1,8) and (1,9) \u2013 adjacent vertically.\n\nEnemy could move RIGHT to (3,9). Then we are at (1,8) and (3,9) \u2013 not adjacent.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nWhat about if enemy moves into my body? My body will be at (2,8) after I move LEFT? Actually, if I move LEFT to (1,8), my new body is [(2,8)]. So (2,8) will be occupied by my body. If enemy moves from (2,9) DOWN to (2,8), they would move into my body! That would cause them to die instantly! Because another snake's head moving into YOUR body results in THEIR death. So if enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), they die. That's perfect! I win immediately because they die and I survive. So moving LEFT is a great trap: if enemy moves DOWN, they crash into my body and I win. If they move elsewhere, I'm still in a good position.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (2,9), my body becomes [(2,8)]. If enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), they would also move into my body? Actually, if I move UP, my new body is [(2,8)] as well. So same effect: if enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), they die. So both UP and LEFT give that risk for enemy. But with UP, I'm on the edge.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,7), my body becomes [(2,8)]? Wait, if I move DOWN to (2,7), my new body is [(2,8)] (old head). So again body at (2,8). So all moves result in my body being at (2,8) (except if I move RIGHT, which is illegal). So regardless of which direction I choose (except RIGHT), my body will be at (2,8). That means if enemy moves DOWN from (2,9) to (2,8), they die. So the threat exists for any move except RIGHT.\n\nThus, I should choose the move that gives me the best positioning after the turn, knowing that enemy might die if they move down.\n\nNow, which move gives me the best positioning? If enemy moves DOWN, I win instantly. So we can assume they won't move DOWN if they're smart, because they'd die. But maybe they don't anticipate that? As the streamer, I should assume they might be smart, but maybe they're reckless. Let's think: They have 0 apples, I have 1. They might want to eat an apple. The closest apples: (0,9) is two steps left, (5,9) is three steps right, (0,6) is down-left, (6,4) is down-right. So they might go LEFT to (1,9) to eventually get (0,9) apple. Or RIGHT to (3,9) to go for (5,9). Or DOWN to (2,8) \u2013 but that's moving into my body if I stay put? Actually, if I don't move, they would move into my body and die. But I am moving. However, if I move LEFT to (1,8), my body is at (2,8). So (2,8) is still occupied. So if they move DOWN to (2,8), they die. So they probably won't move DOWN unless they have a death wish. So likely they'll move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf they move LEFT to (1,9), and I move LEFT to (1,8), then we are at (1,8) and (1,9). That's adjacent. Next turn, I could go UP to (1,9) to attack, and if they move DOWN to (1,8), we collide? They could move away. But it's a tense situation.\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (3,9), and I move LEFT to (1,8), then they are at (3,9), I at (1,8). That's farther apart. They could go for (5,9) apple. I would need to chase.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,9), and they move LEFT to (1,9), then we are at (2,9) and (1,9). Adjacent. I can go LEFT next turn. If they move RIGHT to (3,9), we are at (2,9) and (3,9). Also adjacent.\n\nSo both UP and LEFT put me adjacent to enemy if they move left or right. But with UP, I'm on the edge; with LEFT, I'm one row below the top, giving me more escape downward.\n\nGiven the flexibility, I think LEFT is better.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (0,9) on the top-left corner. If enemy goes for it, I want to be in a position to block or snatch it. From (1,8), I can go UP to (1,9) or LEFT to (0,8) then UP to (0,9). From (2,9), I can go LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9). So both are okay.\n\nBut consider that if I move LEFT to (1,8), my body is at (2,8). If I later go UP to (1,9), my body will be at (1,8) and (2,8). Then from (1,9), I can go LEFT to (0,9) if it's still there. That could be a plan.\n\nAlso, if I move UP to (2,9), my body at (2,8). Then if I go LEFT to (1,9), my body becomes (2,9) and (2,8)? Wait, after moving UP to (2,9), my body is [(2,8)]. If I then move LEFT to (1,9), new head (1,9), body becomes [(2,9)] (old head). So my body would be at (2,9). That's fine.\n\nBut from an edge, it's riskier.\n\nThus, I'll go LEFT.\n\nBut wait, there's another consideration: The apple at (6,0) is far, but there are apples at (6,2) and (7,2) etc. I might want to eventually go for those. Moving LEFT goes away from those, but maybe I should focus on controlling the enemy first.\n\nI think aggression means closing in, not chasing distant apples. So LEFT.\n\nNow, I need to output my move as the last word.\n\nBefore that, I should provide the decision process and rationale.\n\nSo my final move: LEFT.Alright chat, turn 4 and we're ready to set the trap! Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'm at (2,8) after my last move LEFT. My body is now at (3,8). Enemy is at (2,9). All snakes move simultaneously this turn.\n\n**Checking moves:**\n- **UP to (2,9):** Enemy is currently there but will move away. Safe move, but puts me on the top edge. From (2,9), I'd only have LEFT and RIGHT as safe options (UP is out of bounds, DOWN into my own body). Limited flexibility. Could work, but edge play is risky.\n- **DOWN to (2,7):** Moves me away from enemy. Not aggressive, gives them more space. Safe, but passive.\n- **LEFT to (1,8):** Moves toward the left side, maintains flexibility. From (1,8), I have UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe directions (RIGHT into my body). Good balance.\n- **RIGHT to (3,8):** That's my own body! Illegal \u2013 instant death. Eliminated.\n\n**Why LEFT?**  \n1. **Aggression:** I'm closing in on the enemy's territory without committing to the edge.  \n2. **Trap potential:** My body will be at (2,8) after moving LEFT. If the enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), they die instantly (head into my body). Even if they don't, being at (1,8) keeps pressure.  \n3. **Flexibility:** From (1,8), I can go UP next turn to intercept if they go for the (0,9) apple, or go LEFT/DOWN to chase elsewhere.  \n4. **Score lead:** I'm 1-0, so I can afford to force confrontations. Left position allows me to cut off the left-side apples, starving them.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \n- Stay aggressive: Use body positioning to block enemy access to apples.  \n- Chase toward the left-top corner, aiming to trap them against the wall.  \n- If they move into my body, GG. Otherwise, next move likely UP to (1,9) to challenge directly.\n\nLEFT",

My tail is at (3,8) (since I didn't eat last turn). Enemy has no body segments listed\u2014just a head at (2,9) with body \"none\". That means they're length 1.\n\nI have to evaluate all four directions.\n\n1. **UP to (2,9):** Enemy is currently there but will move (they can't stay). UP is valid since y=9 is max, but wait\u2014coordinate (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right, so y=9 is top row. Moving UP from (2,8) goes to (2,9). Is that within bounds? Yes, y=9 is allowed. So UP is valid. However, if I go UP and enemy moves DOWN to (2,8), they'd move into my current position? But simultaneously, I leave (2,8) for (2,9) and they leave (2,9) for (2,8). That's a swap, not a collision. That's safe. But from (2,9), I'm on the top edge. My body will be at (2,8). From (2,9), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP? UP would be y=10\u2014out of bounds. DOWN into my own body (2,8). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's only two options, which limits my future moves. Not ideal. Might work, but could trap me.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,7):** y=7 is valid. Board shows (2,7) is '.' (empty). No apple. This moves me away from enemy. Less aggressive. But gives more room. Could be safe, but doesn't pressure enemy.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,8):** x=1 valid. Board shows (1,8) is '.' after my last move (since I moved left to (2,8) last turn, (1,8) was empty). So safe. My body will be at (2,8) after move. From (1,8), I can go UP (to (1,9)), DOWN (to (1,7)), LEFT (to (0,8)), but RIGHT would be into my own body (2,8). So three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good flexibility.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,8):** That's where my body is! Illegal, instant death. Eliminated.\n\n**Ranking safe moves:**\n- LEFT: 3 safe follow-up moves, moves toward enemy's area (top-left corner), flexible.\n- UP: Only 2 safe follow-up moves (LEFT, RIGHT), puts me on edge, less flexible.\n- DOWN: Many safe moves but passive, moves away from enemy.\n\n**Strategy:** I'm leading in apples (1-0). I should be aggressive and try to trap the enemy. If I go LEFT, I position myself to cut off the left side (apple at (0,9) and (1,2)). My body at (2,8) acts as a potential death zone if enemy moves into it. Even if they don't, being at (1,8) allows me to chase or block. Plus, from (1,8), I can go UP to (1,9) next turn to confront them directly. That seems stronger.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Control the top-left quadrant. Use my body to create barriers. Force enemy toward the corner or into my path. If they go for left apple, I can intercept. If they go right, I can follow. Keep flexibility while applying pressure. Score lead means I can risk a head-on if it arises.\n\n**Move:** LEFT\n\n**Final move line:**  \nLEFT",

We\u2019re in a prime spot to pressure, but safety first.\n\nOptions this turn:\n- DOWN to (0,8) \u2014 safe, hugs the left wall, and heads toward the left-column apple line. Keeps multiple escape routes and avoids a guaranteed head-on this turn.\n- RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 also safe; stays near the top and could set up a wall-based squeeze later, but may invite a looser chase if he pivots.\n\nWhy DOWN: It preserves space, nudges us toward the left-side apple flow, and reduces risk of a bad head-on with an even score. It also sets up faster growth later by targeting (0,6) when the apple spawns or is reachable.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN this turn to (0,8).\n- If he shifts to (1,8) or (2,9), adapt by keeping a leash along the wall and look for the next apple path on (0,6) to grow.\n- Prioritize growth when the opportunity presents itself, then tighten the corridor to pressure him toward the edge.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",
