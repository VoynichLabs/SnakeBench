Time to establish dominance! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down the battlefield:\n- **My position**: Head at (7, 8) - pretty high up, near the top-right quadrant\n- **Enemy position**: Head at (0, 2) - bottom-left corner, opposite side of the board\n- **Apples**: 15 apples scattered everywhere, some close to me\n- **Strategy**: The enemy is far away right now, so I can focus on claiming territory and apples while being ready to box him in later. I need to think ahead about cutting off his routes.\n\n**EVALUATING MY MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7, 9) - Valid! Moves me to the top edge, gives me more top-row control\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 7) - Valid! Moves me toward the apple at (7, 7) \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 8) - Valid! Moves me left toward apples at (6, 8) and (6, 6)\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 8) - Valid! Moves me right toward apples at (8, 8) and (8, 2) and (8, 4)\n\nAll moves are safe since I'm solo with no body yet. Now let's think strategically:\n\n- The enemy is at (0, 2) in the bottom-left, so I should probably move **DOWN** or **LEFT** to start claiming the central apples and work toward the middle of the board where I can control more territory\n- Moving UP to (7, 9) puts me against the top wall - not ideal for long-term mobility\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 8) keeps me near the edge too\n- **DOWN to (7, 7)** gets me closer to the apple at (7, 7) AND keeps me in a central position with good mobility\n- **LEFT to (6, 8)** also gives me access to multiple apples and keeps me central\n\nActually, let me reconsider - the apple at (7, 7) is RIGHT THERE below me. That's an immediate +1 point and growth. Plus it keeps me in the central zone with 4-directional freedom. The enemy is far enough away that I can safely secure this apple without immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term plan**: Secure the central apples first (especially the cluster around center-right), grow my body, and then start moving toward the left side to cut off the enemy's expansion routes and trap him against the edge. I want to control the board's center and right side first.\n\n**DECISION**: I'm going **DOWN** to (7, 7) to grab that apple immediately and establish a presence near the center of the board. This gives me momentum and keeps my options wide open for the next turn!\n\nDOWN",

I just ate that apple! \ud83d\udcaa Now I have 1 apple, same as my opponent who has 1 apple too (they must have just eaten one).\n\nLooking at the board:\n- **My position**: Head (7,7), Body [(7,8)] - I'm growing!\n- **Enemy position**: Head (1,2), Body: none - they're still in the bottom-left corner\n- **Key apples near me**: (7,6) right below, (8,6), (6,6), (8,4), (8,2), (6,8), (8,8) - tons of apples in my zone!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (Turn 1):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7,8) - That's my own body! That's a crash into myself. DEAD. \u274c\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7,6) - Valid! Moves toward apple at (7,6) which is right there! \u2705\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6,7) - Valid!

I can continue dominating the right side of the board\n- I need to keep my options open - don't get boxed in\n- I want to grow while maintaining mobility\n- The cluster of apples on my right side is lucrative: (8,6), (8,4), (8,2), (8,8)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** I'm going to systematically claim the right side of the board (columns 7-9), grow my body, and then move leftward to cut off the enemy's expansion. By the time they realize what's happening, they'll be trapped against the left edge! \n\nI'm thinking **RIGHT** is the move - it keeps me in the central-right zone, gives me access to multiple apples, and maintains 3-4 future options (UP, DOWN, or further RIGHT next turn). \n\nDOWN would move me toward (7,6) but limit my future mobility slightly. LEFT moves me toward the center but might get me stuck near my own body eventually. RIGHT gives me the most flexibility!\n\nLet's GOOOO! RIGHT it is! \ud83d\udd25",

I can safely grow and prepare to box them in later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep eating apples on the right/top edge to grow my body. Once I'm 5-6 segments long, I'll start moving left to create a wall that cuts off the enemy's expansion. They'll be trapped against the left edge with nowhere to go.

Now I have 3 apples! \ud83d\udd25\n- **My body:** [(7, 8), (8, 8)] \u2014 I'm growing, so my tail stays at (8,8) for now\n- **Enemy head:** (1, 2) \u2014 They moved! Now at (1,2) with body at (1,1) and (2,1). They're still in the bottom-left.\n- **Apple locations:** Key ones near me: (7,5), (8,4), (8,2), (9,6), (9,1)\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS CHECK:**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6, 9) \u2014 **VALID!** That's space. Future options: (5,9), (7,9). 2 safe exits. Top edge, but okay.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 7) \u2014 **VALID!** That's space. Future options: (5,7), (7,7), (6,6). 3 safe exits. Good flexibility!\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 8) \u2014 **VALID!** That's space. Future options: (4,8), (5,9), (5,7). 3 safe exits. Moving toward the left side.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 8) \u2014 **DEAD!** That's my own body (tail)! Can't move into myself. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:**\n\nI just scored! 3 apples to 2! Now I'm leading! \ud83d\udcaa Time to press the advantage!\n\n**DOWN to (6, 7)** is the move! Why?\n\n1. **POSITIONING** \u2014 Moving DOWN puts me closer to the apple at (7,5) and (8,4). I can start hunting those while staying centrally located.\n\n2. **BOARD CONTROL** \u2014 From (6,7), I have 3 escape routes: (5,7), (7,7), (6,6). This keeps me flexible and mobile. I'm not getting trapped!\n\n3. **ENEMY ASSESSMENT** \u2014 Snake #1 is at (1,2) with 2 apples. They're still far away in the bottom-left. I have time to maneuver and grow before they become a real threat.\n\n4. **SCORE ADVANTAGE** \u2014 I'm up 3-2! I should play slightly more aggressively to maintain pressure. Moving DOWN keeps me in the game to grab more apples and extend my lead.\n\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN** \u2014 From (6,7), I'll assess apples at (7,5) and (8,4) next turn. I want to dominate the upper-right quadrant and force the enemy into tight spaces. Once I have a bigger lead, I can try to box them in!\n\n**COMPARING ALTERNATIVES:**\n- **UP to (6,9)** \u2014 Gets me to the top edge with only 2 escape routes. Risky for long-term survival.\n- **LEFT to (5,8)** \u2014 Safe but doesn't get me closer to any immediate apples. Might be too passive.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN to (6,7)! I'm maintaining mobility, staying flexible, and positioning myself to grab more apples while the enemy is still far away. Let's extend this lead! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Turn 7, let's break down this move!\n\n**Board State Check:**\n- **My head:** (6, 6) - Just moved DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) - **ATE THE APPLE!** Now 3 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **My body:** [(6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8)]\n- **Enemy head:** (1, 4) - Moved UP from (1,3) to (1,4)! Their body: [(1, 3), (1, 2)]\n- **Score:** ME: 3, ENEMY: 2 - **I HAVE THE LEAD!** Let's keep it!\n\n**Movement Options (HEAD AT 6,6):**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6, 7) - **DEAD!** That's my own body! \u274c\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 5) - **VALID!** Future options: (5,5), (7,5), (6,4) - 3 exits\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 6) - **VALID!** Future options: (4,6), (5,7), (5,5) - 3 exits\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 6) - **VALID!** Future options: (8,6), (7,7), (7,5) - 3 exits\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:** Snake #1 is at (1,4) - still on the left side but climbing UP toward top-left. They're not directly threatening me yet, but I need to start cutting off their territory!\n\n**APPLE DENSITY:** Looking at the board, I see apples at:\n- (5, 4) - South-west of me\n- (7, 5) - South-east of me  \n- (8, 2) - Far right, south\n- (9, 6) - Far right, middle\n\n**MY GOAL:** Stay aggressive, keep the lead, and start boxing in the enemy!\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**DOWN to (6,5)** \u2192 Moves toward (5,4) and (7,5) - TWO apples nearby! From (6,5) I can chase both left and right apples. Also gets me closer to the bottom of the board, potentially cutting off enemy's southward expansion. **STRONG!**\n\n**LEFT to (5,6)** \u2192 Moves toward (5,4) but (6,5) gets me closer to TWO apples. Also puts me closer to enemy territory where I might force collisions.\n\n**RIGHT to (7,6)** \u2192 Moves toward (7,5) apple, but again (6,5) gives me better access to BOTH (5,4) and (7,5) apples.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n**DOWN to (6,5)** is the play! Here's why:\n1. **DOUBLE APPLE ACCESS** - From (6,5), I'm adjacent to (5,4) and can also go to (7,5) - maximizing my next move options!\n2. **BOARD CONTROL** - Moving down pushes toward the bottom, potentially boxing the enemy into the left wall\n3. **LEVERAGE LEAD** - I'm ahead 3-2, so I should expand aggressively while staying safe\n4. **3 ESCAPE ROUTES** - (5,5), (7,5), (6,4) all keep me mobile\n5. **FORCE THEIR HAND** - By taking central positions, I force the enemy to react to MY movements!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (6,5), next turn I'll likely go for (5,4) or (7,5) depending on enemy movement. The goal is to establish a line across the middle-right of the board and force the enemy into the left corner where I can trap them!\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** DOWN to keep the pressure on!\n\nDOWN",

From (7,4): (8,4), (7,3), (7,5) - 3 safe exits!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\n**OPTION 1: RIGHT to (8,5) - PUSH FOR BOARD CONTROL!**\n- **BENEFIT:** Claims space near (8,5) apple, getting ready to eat it next turn\n- **BENEFIT:** Expands my territory to x=8-9, boxing enemy toward left wall\n- **BENEFIT:** From (8,5), I can see (9,6) apple and (9,1) apple - both reachable!\n- **BENEFIT:** Creates a horizontal barrier cutting off enemy from right side\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (7,6) - GO FOR THE APPLE!**\n- **BENEFIT:** Grows me to 6 apples! Score becomes 6-2!\n- **BENEFIT:** Gets me closer to (8,2) and (8,3) apples\n- **RISK:** Might leave right side slightly less controlled\n\n**OPTION 3: DOWN to (7,4) - SAFE BUT LESS AGGRESSIVE**\n- Moves toward (8,4) or (7,3) apples\n- Less immediate growth potential\n\n**THE PLAY: RIGHT TO (8,5) - ESTABLISH DOMINANCE!**\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **BOARD DOMINATION** - Moving right to (8,5) claims the central-right area permanently\n2. **FUTURE APPLE ACCESS** - From (8,5), I can get (9,6) or (8,2) apples easily, and I'm adjacent to (8,5) apple\n3. **ENEMY TRAP** - My body now spans from x=6 to x=8, creating a vertical wall that enemy cannot cross to the right side (x=7-9)\n4. **TERRITORY CLAIMING** - I'm occupying 3 columns (6,7,8) while enemy is stuck in column 1\n5. **SCORE LEVERAGE** - Already leading 5-2, I can afford to set up the trap before growing further\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 9: Move RIGHT to (8,5), establish the barrier\nTurn 10: Likely RIGHT to (9,5) or UP to (8,6) to grab apples and complete the wall\nGoal: Box enemy into columns 0-2, then chase down remaining apples while maintaining my 3+ apple lead. Force them into a dead-end where they have to crash into me!\n\n**TIME TO BUILD THE WALL AND FINISH THIS!** \ud83e\uddf1\n\nRIGHT",

DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**Enemy Position:**\n- Head: (1, 7) - They moved UP from (1,6)!\n- Body: [(1, 6), (1, 5)] - Still vertical at x=1\n- Score: 2 apples - THEY'RE DROWNING! \ud83d\ude35\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My body creates a massive barrier: (6,5)-(8,5) horizontal at y=5, plus vertical segments above!\n- Enemy is trapped in columns 0-2, completely cut off from the right side\n- **APPLE AT (9,5)** - Directly to my right! Can claim it this turn!\n- **APPLE AT (8,2)** - Down 3 steps, but risky with my own body path\n- **APPLE AT (9,6)** - Up-right from my head\n- Enemy is at (1,7) - they have no access to right side apples\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS - ELIMINATING THE DEADLY:**\n\n**LEFT to (7,5):** \u274c **DEAD!** That's my own body segment!

That's a 5-point lead! Game might be over if I maintain this!\n2. **TERRITORIAL COMPLETE DOMINATION** - I now occupy columns 6-9, creating an impenetrable wall that cuts enemy off from 40% of the board\n3. **ENEMY IS TRAPPED** - Enemy in columns 0-2 has NO access to 7 apples on the right side (all apples at x=7,8,9)\n4. **SAFE EXIT OPTIONS** - From (9,5): I can go UP to (9,6) for next apple, DOWN to (9,4), or back LEFT to (8,5)\n5. **PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE** - 7-2 lead with 140 turns left? They're mentally broken! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 10: RIGHT to (9,5), eat apple \u2192 7-2 lead\nTurn 11: Likely UP to (9,6) for another apple \u2192 8-2 lead\nTurn 12+: Sweep remaining apples on right side (9,6), then work back to claim (8,3), (8,2) etc.\n**ULTIMATE GOAL:** Hit 15 apples before turn 50, then start closing the trap on enemy.

So I won\u2019t crash into a head\u2011on collision no matter which safe direction I pick. \ud83c\udfaf  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 My short\u2011term move: I want to keep my options open and set myself up for that sweet (0,7) apple on the left column. To do that I need to get out of the way of my own tail, so moving **UP** to (2,8) is the cleanest way to clear the path and stay flexible.

Avoid getting boxed in, keep multiple safe follow\u2011ups alive. \ud83d\ude80  \n\nAlright, let\u2019s make the climb!  \n\nUP",

The enemy is crumbling!\n\n**Enemy Position:**\n- **Head: (2, 8)** - Still trapped in the left corner.\n- **Body:** [(2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6)] - Their vertical wall is weak.\n- **Score: 3 apples** - They're barely hanging on.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- **Apple at (8, 4)** - Directly below us, two steps away.\n- **Apple at (8, 2)** and **(8, 3)** - Down in our territory, easy to sweep.\n- **Apple at (7, 2)** and **(7, 3)** - We can reach these from (8,2).\n- **Apple at (4, 8)** and **(4, 9)** - Central left, but enemy might go for them.\n- **Apple at (0, 7)** and **(0, 0)** - Enemy's side, but they're too slow to reach them.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS - ELIMINATING THE DEADLY:**\n\n**UP to (9, 7):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell. From (9,7): (9,8), (8,7), (9,6) - 3 safe exits. But moving away from the apple cluster below.\n\n**DOWN to (9, 5):** \u274c **DEAD!** That's my own body segment! Moving into myself = instant death.\n\n**LEFT to (8, 6):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell. From (8,6): (8,5), (8,7), (7,6), (9,6) - 4 safe exits!

Instant loss.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\n**OPTION 1: UP to (9, 7) - EXPLORE UPPER RIGHT**\n- Moves away from the apple cluster below.\n- From (9,7), I'd have to eventually turn back down to reach (8,4) and others.\n- **NOT OPTIMAL!** I'm chasing apples I already passed.\n\n**OPTION 2: LEFT to (8, 6) - SWEEP THE LOWER RIGHT CLUSTER** \ud83c\udfc6\n- **BENEFIT:** Directly moves toward apples at (8,4), (8,2), (8,3), (7,2), (7,3).\n- **BENEFIT:** Maintains access to multiple safe directions from (8,6).\n- **BENEFIT:** Keeps my wall intact and expands my territory control.\n- **BENEFIT:** Enemy is still trapped and can't interfere with this apple sweep.\n\n**THE PLAY: LEFT TO (8, 6) - SET UP THE APPLE SWEEP!** \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **TERRITORIAL DOMINANCE** - Moving to column 8 gives me access to the entire right-side apple cluster. I can eat 5+ apples in the next few turns!\n2. **SCORE EXPLOSION INCOMING** - With 8 apples now, hitting that cluster will push me toward 15 apples by turn 20. The enemy will be mentally broken!\n3. **SAFETY FIRST** - From (8,6), I have 4 exit options. I'm not cornering myself at all.\n4. **ENEMY IS HELPLESS** - They're stuck on the left side, watching me feast on their potential apples. They can't reach the right side before I eat them all.\n5. **PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE** - Every apple I eat widens the gap. The enemy knows they can't catch up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 12: LEFT to (8,6)\nTurn 13: DOWN to (8,5) - but wait, that's my body! Actually from (8,6) I can go DOWN to (8,5) but that's my tail segment. NO! From (8,6) I need to go DOWN to (8,5) but that's occupied. Let me recalculate.\nActually from (8,6): DOWN goes to (8,5) which is my body. So I need to plan differently.\nBetter plan: From (8,6), I can go DOWN to (8,5) but that's blocked by my own tail. So I should go LEFT to (7,6) or DOWN to (8,5) but that's my body.\nWait, my body is at (8,5), so DOWN from (8,6) goes to (8,5) which is ME. So that's illegal.\nFrom (8,6), safe moves: LEFT to (7,6), UP to (8,7), RIGHT to (9,6). DOWN is blocked by my own body.\nSo from (8,6), I'll go LEFT to (7,6) to work my way down to (7,2) and (7,3).\n\n**ULTIMATE GOAL:** Sweep the entire right-side apple cluster (8,4), (8,2), (8,3), (7,2), (7,3), (4,3) to hit 15 apples by turn 20. Then consider boxing the enemy in the corner.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT!** We're on fire! The enemy is watching us eat apples they can't reach! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

I'm not cornering myself at all.\n4. **ENEMY IS HELPLESS** - They're stuck on the left side, watching me feast on apples they can't reach. They can't reach the right side before I eat them all.\n5. **PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE** - Every apple I eat widens the gap. The enemy knows they can't catch up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 13: LEFT to (7,6) - Set up the sweep\nTurn 14: DOWN to (7,5) - But wait, that's my body! NO! From (7,6), DOWN goes to (7,5) which is MY body. So I need to plan differently.\nActually from (7,6): DOWN is blocked (my body at (7,5)), so I'll go LEFT to (6,6) or DOWN to (7,5) but that's ME.\nWait, from (7,6): SAFE moves are UP to (7,7), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6), DOWN is blocked by my own body at (7,5).\nSo from (7,6), I'll go DOWN to (7,5) but that's my body... NO!\nActually, I need to check my body: My body is [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].\nSo (7,5) IS my body. DOWN from (7,6) goes to (7,5) which is ME = DEATH.\nSo from (7,6), safe moves: UP to (7,7), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6).\nI'll go DOWN to (7,5) is ILLEGAL. I'll go LEFT to (6,6) which is my body too! (6,6) is in my body list! NO!\nWait, my body includes (6,6). So LEFT from (7,6) to (6,6) is also MY BODY = DEATH.\nUP from (7,6) to (7,7) is SAFE.\nRIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6) is SAFE (we just left it).\nSo from (7,6), my only safe moves are UP to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,6).\nI'll go UP to (7,7) to stay safe and keep options open.\n\n**ULTIMATE GOAL:** Sweep the entire right-side apple cluster (8,4), (8,2), (8,3), (7,2), (7,3), (4,3) to hit 15+ apples by turn 20. Then consider boxing the enemy in the corner.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT!** We're on fire! The enemy is watching us eat apples they can't reach! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Up is forward progress. We're on the attack!\n4. **ENEMY CAN'T INTERFERE** - They're stuck on the left side (around x=3-4). They can't reach my hunting grounds before I clean up.\n5. **PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE** - Every turn I stay healthy and mobile, the enemy knows they're falling further behind.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nTurn 15: From (7,7), I'll assess the board. If the enemy is still lagging, I'll likely go DOWN to (7,6) (which will be empty by then as my tail moves) and continue toward the apple cluster at (7,3) and below. My goal is to hit the (7,3), (8,3), (7,2), (8,2) apples in the next 3-4 turns.

At least 3 options, but one is blocked.\n- **TERRITORY:** Moves toward enemy's side (left side), but might be safer long-term.\n\n**OPTION 3: RIGHT to (8, 7)** - THE RIGHT FLANK\n- **SAFETY:** Clear.\n- **POSITIONING:** Stays in column 8, close to apple at (8,3).\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (8,7): UP to (8,8) [empty], DOWN to (8,6) [blocked by my body], LEFT to (7,7) [empty], RIGHT to (9,7) [empty]. 3 safe options.\n- **TERRITORY:** Dominates the right side, but might be limited.\n\n**THE DECISION:** LEFT TO (6, 7) - CONTROL THE CENTER! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **SAFETY & FLEXIBILITY** - From (6,7), I have 3 safe directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) and can maintain a strong central position. Down is blocked, but that's okay.\n2. **CENTRAL DOMINANCE** - This puts me between the enemy's left-side cluster and my right-side apples. I control the board!\n3. **AVOIDING TRAPS** - Going DOWN to (7,6) creates a dangerous bottleneck where I might trap myself next turn. Better to stay flexible.\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE** - From (6,7), I can threaten both the central apples AND the enemy's path. They're at (4,9) - I'm boxing them in!\n5. **SCORE ADVANTAGE** - I'm up 2 apples. I don't NEED to rush. I need to dominate the space and force mistakes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 16: From (6,7), assess if I can safely go LEFT to (5,7) or RIGHT to (7,7) to continue positioning. Watch enemy movement - if they go down, I might cut them off. Goal is to secure the central apple cluster at (4,3), (3,3), (2,6) within 4-5 turns while keeping my escape routes open.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT!** The enemy thinks they're safe on the left side - I'm about to prove them wrong! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

My head is at (6,7) after that cautious LEFT last turn. I need to keep my options open and not get trapped. Enemy is at (5,9) \u2013 they're vulnerable.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Current Head Position:** (6,7)\n**Body:** [(7,7), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5)]\n**Score:** 8 vs 5 \u2013 I win if we collide head-on!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS - CHECKING SAFETY:**\n\n**UP to (6,8):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty. But moving toward enemy territory... risky.\n**DOWN to (6,6):** \u274c **DEAD!** My own body (7,6) is directly below. That's a backward move into myself. INSTANT DEATH.\n**LEFT to (5,7):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty. Moves me toward the center.\n**RIGHT to (7,7):** \u2705 **SAFE!** That's my own tail cell! The tail at (6,5) will move this turn, making (7,7) empty. SAFE!\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION 1: UP to (6,8)**\n- **SAFETY:** Clear.\n- **POSITIONING:** Aggressive! Positions me right under the enemy's head at (5,9). From here, I could potentially head-on next turn if they move down.\n- **RISK:** Moving into their immediate vicinity. If they move down to (5,8), I could collide. But with a 3-score lead, I WANT that collision! \ud83d\udc80\n- **TERRITORY:** Claims the top center.\n\n**OPTION 2: LEFT to (5,7)**\n- **SAFETY:** Clear.\n- **POSITIONING:** Central control. Moves toward the apple cluster at (4,3), (3,3).\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (5,7), I can go UP to (5,8) [empty], LEFT to (4,7) [empty], RIGHT to (6,7) [empty]. DOWN is blocked by my body at (5,5)? Wait, (5,5) is NOT in my body! My body is at (6,5), (7,5), etc. So DOWN to (5,6) is empty too! That's 4 safe options!\n- **TERRITORY:** Perfect central position.\n\n**OPTION 3: RIGHT to (7,7)**\n- **SAFETY:** Safe (tail moves).\n- **POSITIONING:** Stays on the right, but feels passive. I'd be retreading my path.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (7,7): UP to (7,8) [empty], DOWN to (7,6) [blocked], LEFT to (6,7) [empty], RIGHT to (8,7) [empty]. 3 safe options.\n- **TERRITORY:** Right side only.\n\n**THE DECISION:** UP to (6,8) - FORCE THE CONFRONTATION! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **SCORE ADVANTAGE IS KING!** I'm up 8-5. If I can force a head-on collision where we both die, I WIN (higher apples). If he dies into my body, I WIN. I WANT him to move down!\n2. **POSITIONING IS PERFECT:** (6,8) puts me directly below his head (5,9). He has limited safe moves: UP (9,9) is safe but empty, DOWN (5,8) leads to ME, LEFT (4,9) is his own body, RIGHT (6,9) is empty but brings him closer to me. If he goes DOWN to chase apples or escape, we collide. That's GAME.\n3. **LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** Even if he avoids collision, (6,8) gives me access to the top row and a strong defensive position. I can pivot left to (5,8) or right to (7,8) next turn.\n4. **AGGRESSION:** We're not here to hide. We're here to CRUSH. Let him feel the pressure of my 3-apple lead.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT!** I'm putting my head in the danger zone and daring him to move down. Either he plays scared and gives me more space, or he plays into my hands and gives me the win. NO LOSING MOVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

If I move DOWN, UP, or RIGHT, I avoid immediate collision.\n\n**TERRITORY & APPLES:**\n- **Apple at (5,8):** IT'S GONE. The enemy moved onto it this turn. I didn't get it. That sucks, but he's eating to survive.\n- **Apple at (6,7):** I moved off it? No, I was at (6,7) last turn. The apple at (6,7) might still be there or I ate it last turn? The log says I moved UP from (6,7). If I didn't eat it, it's there. But the list of apples includes (7,2) etc. I don't see (6,7) in the current list, so I likely ate it.\n- **Strategic Positioning:** I need to maintain pressure. He is currently \"in my body\" if you look at the grid? No.\n**Grid Check (Turn 16 Start):**\nHead 0: (6,7) -> Moved UP to (6,8).\nHead 1: (5,9) -> Moved DOWN to (5,8).\n**Grid Check (Turn 17 Start - Now):**\nMy Body: (6,7) [previous head], (7,7), (7,6)...\nEnemy Body: (5,9) [previous head], (4,9), (4,8)...\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6,9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check bounds (6,9) is valid (0-9).\n    *   **Check Body:** My body is at (6,7) and below. (6,9) is clear.\n    *   **Check Enemy:** Enemy head is at (5,8). Enemy body is at (5,9), (4,9)...\n    *   **Risk:** (6,9) is empty. This moves me away from the enemy (5,8).\n    *   **Analysis:** Safe, but passive. I give up the center.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6,7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check bounds (6,7) is valid.\n    *   **Check Body:** (6,7) is my previous head location. It becomes part of my body *after* I move, but wait... the rule says: \"If you crash into him, you lose.\" and \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\"\n    *   **CRITICAL:** My body currently occupies (6,7) (from last turn's head). If I move DOWN, I am moving my head into my own body. **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5,8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check bounds (5,8) is valid.\n    *   **Check Body:** My body does not cover (5,8).\n    *   **Check Enemy:** Enemy head is currently at (5,8). **HEAD ON COLLISION.**\n    *   **Result:** Both heads move into the same cell? Both die.\n    *   **Score:** 8 vs 5. If we both die, I win (8 > 5).\n    *   **Analysis:** INSTANT WIN condition. I can end the game right now.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7,8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check bounds (7,8) is valid.\n    *   **Check Body:** My body does not cover (7,8).\n    *   **Check Enemy:** Enemy body covers (4,8), (5,9) etc. (7,8) is clear.\n    *   **Analysis:** Safe. Moves me away from the enemy.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI hold the score advantage (8-5). A head-on collision guarantees my victory. The enemy moved to (5,8), potentially to eat an apple or flank. I am at (6,8). If I move LEFT to (5,8), we collide. This is the cleanest way to secure the win without risking a chase or getting trapped by his body.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO CHAT!** I see him at (5,8). I'm at (6,8). I end this right here. No hesitation. We take the win.\n\nLEFT",

Should we stay on the edge or dive into the centre? \ud83e\udd14  \n\n\ud83e\udded Quick scan:  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,7) is empty, opens a whole row of left\u2011side apples and puts us in a sweet spot to start a pincer.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,8) lands on the rival\u2019s current head; it\u2019s technically safe but leaves us with fewer escape routes.  \n- **LEFT** would smash into our own body.  \n- **UP** would hit our own tail.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Mini\u2011plan for the next few turns:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move **DOWN** \u2192 (5,7)  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn **LEFT** \u2192 (4,7) to start gobbling the (5,4) apple chain.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue **DOWN** \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) to snatch (3,3) and (2,6).  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the growing length to hem in the rival and force a head\u2011on clash when they try to chase.  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 Bottom line: we need to stay alive, grow, and keep options open. DOWN looks like the cleanest, safest, most aggressive move.  \n\nDOWN",
