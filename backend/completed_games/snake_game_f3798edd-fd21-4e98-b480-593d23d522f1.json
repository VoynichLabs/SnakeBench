Now I need to evaluate which move is strategically best.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\nThe nearest apples are at (1, 4), (6, 3), and (5, 2).\n\n- UP moves me toward (1, 4) - this apple is directly northwest at distance ~3-4 steps\n- RIGHT moves me toward (5, 2) and (6, 3) - these are to the right and slightly down\n- LEFT moves me toward (1, 4) - this apple is northwest at distance ~3-4 steps\n- DOWN moves me away from most apples\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- The apple at (1, 4) is quite close and reachable via UP or LEFT\n- Going UP toward (2, 2) then continuing up would bring me closer to (1, 4)\n- Going LEFT toward (1, 1) then up would also work\n- Going RIGHT takes me away from the closest apples\n\nUP seems like the best approach because:\n1. It moves me toward the nearest apple cluster at (1, 4)\n2. It keeps me in the middle-left area where multiple apples are clustered\n3. It doesn't move me toward the enemy at (0, 9) too aggressively early on\n4. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\n**Future Plan:** Continue moving UP toward (1, 4), then maneuver to collect it. After securing one apple, evaluate the next closest apple (either (6, 3) or (5, 2)) and plan a route there.\n\nUP",
