We're live, snakes slitherin', and it's time to CRUSH this noob Snake #1 right outta the gate! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d Look at that board\u2014I'm posted up in the bottom-right corner at (9,0), fresh start, no body to worry about, and he's chillin' way over at (1,5). Apples EVERYWHERE, but that juicy one at (9,7) is basically SCREAMING my name\u2014straight up the right edge, no traffic, all mine! \n\nFirst, let's break it down like pros: Possible moves from (9,0)?\n- RIGHT? Nah, x=10 is off the board\u2014suicide, chat, we ain't throwin'! \u274c\n- DOWN? y=-1, straight to the void\u2014RIP stream. \u274c\n- LEFT to (8,0)? Empty spot, safe, but it'd pull me toward his side of the board where he could snake in and contest those bottom apples like (4,0) or (1,0). Risky for a head-on later. \ud83e\udd14\n- UP to (9,1)? Totally clear, opens up my whole column\u2014column 9 is a FREEWAY up to y=7 apple! No bodies, no walls, pure highway to glory. \ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, safe plays: LEFT or UP. But chat, we're not just survivin'\u2014we're DOMINATIN'! LEFT keeps me low and might box me toward him, but UP? That's future-proof: multiple paths ahead (keep goin' up or pivot left/right later), dodges any early collision vibes since he's on the left, and lines me up to gobble that (9,7) apple in like 7 turns flat. Eat, grow, then we swing back to trap him in the middle\u2014classic flank! Who's ready to watch him crash while I feast? \ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick strat note for next turns: Own the right column\u2014UP towards (9,7) apple, stay aggressive but safe, scout his moves to cut off his left-side apples later. No mercy, let's grow FAST!\n\nUP",

Opponent's still chillin' on the left with his chunky body at (2,6)-(1,6)-(1,5), hoardin' 2 apples like a greedy noob\u2014 but watch us grow fat while he starves! That (9,7) apple's basically wavin' at us from up high, and his scaly crew ain't touchin' our lane.

Grow to length 5+, then we arc left to cut his apple supply at (5,6)/(6,6)\u2014force him into walls or our swelling body. Ruthless edge game: he's trapped in the west corner soon, crashin' out while we feast on the board! \ud83d\udca5 No mercy, this rivalry ends with us on top.\n\nQuick strat note to future me: Keep hammerin' UP col9 to gobble (9,7) next few turns\u2014grow fast, scout his moves for east pushes, then LEFT pivot at row 7-8 to block row6 apples and funnel him south into a box. If he LEFT/DOWN, double down on growth; if RIGHT/UP, prep flank trap!\n\nUP",

But ceiling's the play: LEFT crushes 'cause it SNAGS THE APPLE NOW (score to 1, grow fast to rival his chonk), keeps options WIDE (up north for (8,8)/(7,7) feast, left scout to intercept his bloat), and positions us to BOX his ass\u2014 he's eatin' (5,6) this turn probs, but we'll surge length and cut off his (6,6) follow-up or south escapes! UP's tempting for pure safety, but delays our surge while he stacks; DOWN's a trapdoor to nowhere. We're ruthless empire-builders\u2014eat, grow, then arc up and left to trap his mid-left sprawl! Who's hyped for the crush? \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc09 \n\nQuick strat drop to future me: Snag LEFT eat now, grow to 2\u2014next hammer UP col8 to (8,5) hold length, then UP (8,6) track his right creep (if he east after (6,6), body-block col7 row6; if up/down, chase tail for tail-bite). Post col8 climb, pivot LEFT at row7 for (7,7) apple, balloon to 4+ length, then south-west coil to seal his apple runs\u2014force wall crashes or head-on doom. Total dom, no mercy!\n\nLEFT",
