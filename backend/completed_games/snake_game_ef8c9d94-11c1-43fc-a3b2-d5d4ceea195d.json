          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current game situation:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 0).\n- The board is 10x10, with my snake initially only occupying that one cell at (7, 0).\n- There are apples at (4, 2), (6, 1), (9, 4), (2, 7), and (7, 8).\n- Enemy snake (#0) is at (3, 6) with no body, so it's just a head.\n\nMy goal is to collect apples efficiently while avoiding collisions with walls, the enemy, and myself. Since I only have a single segment now, the risk of self-collision is minimal until I grow.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 1). To reach it, I need to move downward and possibly leftward. Alternatively, I could aim for the apple at (4, 2), which is below and slightly left, or the apple at (2, 7), which is further left and up.\n\nGiven the starting position, the simplest immediate path seems to be:\n\n- Moving downwards (Y increasing from 0 to 1) to approach apples at lower Y's, then moving left or right as needed.\n\nHowever, let's check for immediate threats:\n\n- Moving up (north): from (7, 0), up to (7, 1). Is that safe?\n\n  - At (7, 1), is there an apple? Yes, at (7, 8), so it doesn't help immediately.\n\n- Moving right: from (7, 0) to (8, 0). No apples along that path.\n\n- Moving left: from (7, 0) to (6, 0). No apples at or near that cell, but nearby apples are at (6, 1).\n\n- Moving down: from (7, 0) to (7, -1). That's outside the board\u2014invalid.\n\nSo, moving down is invalid (wall). Moving up seems safe and brings me closer to (7, 8), the apple above. Moving right is safe, moving left is also safe.\n\nNow, I need to anticipate the best move:\n\n- Moving UP: from (7, 0) to (7, 1). That's safe, and the apple at (7, 8) is quite far, but I can go upward to gather it eventually.\n\n- Moving RIGHT: from (7, 0) to (8, 0). This moves towards no immediate apples, but could be part of a route to get to other apples.\n\n- Moving LEFT: from (7, 0) to (6, 0). Closer to apple at (6, 1). This seems promising for immediate growth.\n\nConsidering proximity and safety:\n\n- Going LEFT to (6, 0) is safe and positions me for the apple at (6, 1).\n\n- Moving UP emphasizes heading toward the apple at (7, 8), but that would require multiple turns.\n\nIt seems practical to go LEFT now, toward the apple at (6, 1). After that, I can plan to go upward to reach the apple at (7, 8).\n\nNext, I should also consider potential threats:\n\n- Enemy at (3, 6): nowhere nearby, so no immediate threat.\n\n- Walls: since starting at (7, 0), moving LEFT to (6, 0) is within bounds.\n\nI plan to move LEFT this turn to aim for the apple at (6, 1), grow, and then proceed towards other apples in subsequent moves.\n\n**Next move:** LEFT",
