Both die, likely a draw since scores are 0-0. This is very risky.\n    *   If I move **UP (0, 8)**: The enemy could move to (0, 6) (apple), (1, 7), (2, 6), or (1, 5).\n        *   The enemy might move (1, 7) or (0, 6). If they move to (1, 7), I am safe at (0, 8).

Both die.\n\n4.  **Strategic decision:**\n\nI am at (0, 7). Apple A1 is at (0, 6). Enemy E1 is at (1, 6).\n\n*   Moving DOWN to (0, 6) is an immediate apple grab, but puts me in direct collision threat with E1 if E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6). Given the relative positions, E1 also has a strong incentive to move to (0, 6) or (1, 7). E1 is closer to the apple (0, 6) by x-coordinate, but I am closer by y-coordinate. If E1 moves LEFT, it gets the apple *and* kills me (or we both die). E1 is only 1 block away from the apple (0, 6). E1 may prioritize the apple.\n\n*   Moving RIGHT to (1, 7) risks collision if E1 moves UP to (1, 7). E1 is also likely to move UP to avoid being constrained by the board edge and possibly attack the apple (5, 7) later, or just for freedom. Collision is highly probable here too.\n\n*   Moving UP to (0, 8) is the safest defensive move. It moves away from E1 and allows me to assess E1's initial objective. I can always come back down for (0, 6) if E1 doesn't take it, or immediately turn RIGHT toward the apple at (5, 7) or (9, 9) if E1 goes down.\n\nGiven that it's turn 0, and a head-on collision results in a draw (or death for both), I must avoid risky moves that immediately target an apple if the enemy is positioned to contest it. The risk of collision on DOWN (0, 6) or RIGHT (1, 7) is too high.\n\nI will move UP to (0, 8) to secure safety and maintain future options.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Priority apple is (5, 7) or (0, 6). E1 seems to be positioned to target (0, 6). If E1 goes for (0, 6), I will head toward (5, 7).\n\nUP",

I am at (0, 8). Moving DOWN to (0, 7) positions me perfectly to grab (0, 6) next turn.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN (0, 7)**, E1 might move LEFT (0, 5) or UP (1, 6) or towards (8, 5). If E1 moves LEFT, it targets (0, 1). If E1 moves UP, it targets (5, 7). The immediate threat of E1 contesting (0, 6) seems to have passed.\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT (1, 8)**, I start moving horizontally toward (5, 7). This is a good strategic target, but (0, 6) is only 2 steps away.\n\nPrioritizing the closest certain apple: (0, 6).\n\nPath to (0, 6): (0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 6) [EAT on Turn 3].\n\nSince E1 is currently at (1, 5), it is unlikely to reach (0, 6) before I do, as it would take E1 at least 2 turns (e.g., (0, 5) then (0, 6) or (1, 6) then (0, 6)). I need 2 turns.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7):\n*   T+1: I am at (0, 7). E1 might be at (1, 6) or (0, 5).\n*   T+2: I move DOWN to (0, 6) (EAT). If E1 is at (1, 6) it could move LEFT to (0, 6) resulting in a head-to-head collision.\n\nLet's re-evaluate E1's likely move from (1, 5). Apples nearby are (0, 1) and (8, 5). E1 is closer to (0, 1), which is 5 steps away. (8, 5) is 7 steps away. (0, 6) is 3 steps away (assuming optimal path change).\n\n*   If E1 targets (0, 1): (1, 5) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1).\n*   If E1 targets (0, 6): (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6). (2 turns).\n\nIf I choose DOWN now to (0, 7), I secure the line to (0, 6).\nNext turn (T+2), I move DOWN to (0, 6). If E1 moves (1, 5)->(1, 6) and (1, 6)->(0, 6), we collide.\n\nIs avoiding collision worth delaying the apple? Yes.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8): I move away from (0, 6) by 1 unit but secure safety.\nT+1: I am at (1, 8). E1 probably moves (1, 6) or (0, 5).\nIf E1 targets (0, 6) and moves (1, 6) then (0, 6), it eats the apple on T+2 and I am safe.\n\nThe apple (0, 6) is highly contested if E1 decides to turn back up. E1 just moved down toward the corner, perhaps prioritizing (0, 1).\n\nIf E1 moves UP to (1, 6) aiming for (0, 6) or (5, 7), and I move DOWN to (0, 7), E1 is still a threat.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8), I open up access to the center and the apple at (5, 7).\nDistance to (5, 7): |1-5| + |8-7| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\nDistance to (0, 6): |1-0| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7), distance to (5, 7) is 5+1=6 steps. Distance to (0, 6) is 1 step.\n\nSince E1 moved DOWN to (1, 5), it suggests a strong probability of continued movement downwards or cross-board (e.g., toward (0, 1) or (8, 5)).\n\nIf I take the risk and move DOWN to (0, 7):\n*   If E1 moves UP (1, 6), then next turn (T+2) I move to (0, 6) and E1 has a choice of going (0, 6) (collision) or (2, 6) or (1, 7). E1 is a simple snake and might go for the apple (0, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8):\n*   T+1: I am at (1, 8). E1 moves (1, 6) (for apple contest) or (0, 5) (for (0, 1) apple).\n*   I can then move DOWN/RIGHT towards (5, 7). This is much safer.\n\nGiven I am only 1 block wide, a head-on collision results in a draw/loss for me since my objective is to win. It is better to let E1 have the contested apple (0, 6) if the risk is high, or make a safe move to another high-value apple like (5, 7). (5, 7) is currently uncontested.\n\nLet's assume E1 is intelligent and will contest (0, 6).\nT=1: I move RIGHT to (1, 8). E1 moves UP to (1, 6) to contest.\nT=2: E1 is at (1, 6), I am at (1, 8). E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6) and eats. I move DOWN to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 8).\n\nIf E1 goes for (0, 1) instead (moves LEFT to (0, 5)):\nT=1: I move RIGHT to (1, 8). E1 moves LEFT to (0, 5).\nT=2: (0, 6) is wide open. I move DOWN to (1, 7). Not ideal.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7) and E1 moves LEFT to (0, 5) (towards (0, 1)):\nT=1: I am at (0, 7). E1 is at (0, 5).\nT=2: I move DOWN to (0, 6) (EAT). E1 is at (0, 4). My safe apple grab!\n\nThis depends entirely on E1's decision between going UP/LEFT for (0, 6) and going LEFT/DOWN for (0, 1). Since E1 just moved DOWN, it suggests a downward motion preference. (0, 1) is a strong candidate for E1.\n\nLet's assume E1 will play greedily for the closest apple they can reach:\nFrom (1, 5): (0, 6) is 2 moves away. (0, 1) is 5 moves away. (8, 5) is 7 moves away.\n(0, 6) is the optimal path for E1 to take *if* it changes its direction immediately upwards.\n\nHowever, I will prioritize safety first. Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) keeps my options open and steers me toward the large open area and apple (5, 7), which E1 is less likely to contest now. It also keeps me parallel to the apple at (0, 6) if E1 doesn't take it.\n\nIf E1 targets (0, 6) by moving (1, 6), my move of RIGHT allows me to monitor E1's path and then decide if I want to re-engage for another apple. If E1 targets (0, 1) by moving (0, 5), I can immediately turn back DOWN/LEFT to take (0, 6) and then move toward (0, 1) if E1 hasn't reached it yet.\n\nChoosing RIGHT seems safest and maintains strategic flexibility toward the large area of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Priority shift to (5, 7) or securing (0, 6) if E1 moves away. Since I moved RIGHT, I will evaluate if E1 contests (0, 6) or (0, 1) next turn. If (0, 6) remains open after T=2, I will pursue it. Otherwise, I will head for (5, 7) or (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

E1 cannot reach (0, 7) this turn (needs to move LEFT, UP or LEFT, DOWN). E1 must move 3 units: (2, 6) -> (1, 7) -> (0, 7). Or (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 7) -> (0, 7). No, E1 is 2 Manhatten distance away from (0, 7). E1 can reach (1, 7) this turn (1 step). E1 cannot reach (0, 7) this turn. Collision risk is zero at (0, 7).\n*   What if E1 moves towards (0, 6)?

Both snakes die.\n\nWe must anticipate E1's move. E1 is currently at (1, 6), right next to the apple (0, 6). It moved LEFT from (2, 6) to (1, 6) on the last turn, confirming its intent to reach (0, 6).\n\nIf I move DOWN, and E1 moves LEFT, we both die.\n\nWe must block or detour E1.\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT (1, 7).**\n    *   I move to (1, 7).\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6) (Eats apple, Length 2).

Both die.\n    *   If E1 moves DOWN/RIGHT (Safer).\n    *   Risk Assessment: High risk if E1 also targets (1, 7). E1 is 1 step from (0, 6) and 1 step from (5, 7) + 5 steps movement. E1 may prioritize the immediate apple (0, 6).\n\n*   **Option B: Move UP (0, 8).**\n    *   I move to (0, 8).\n    *   E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6) (Eats apple, Length 2).

If we move DOWN, E1 and I share the same target cell, resulting in mutual guaranteed death based on its recent trajectory.\n\nWe must yield the apple (0, 6) for now to survive and adjust the plan.\n\nIf E1 eats (0, 6), its head will be at (0, 6) and its body at (1, 6).\n\nLet's look at the next best apples: (0, 1) [6 steps away] or (5, 7) [5 steps away].\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 7):\n*   Target (5, 7) is 4 steps away (R, R, R, D or R, R, R, R, U). 4 steps seems reasonable (e.g., (1, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7)). Wait, (1, 7) to (5, 7) is 4 Manhattan distance.\n    *   T=4: (1, 7) [Move RIGHT]\n    *   T=5: (2, 7)\n    *   T=6: (3, 7)\n    *   T=7: (4, 7)\n    *   T=8: (5, 7) (EAT)\n    *   This path takes 4 turns to reach (5, 7). Total T=8.\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 8):\n*   Target (0, 1) is 7 steps away (D x 7).\n\nMoving RIGHT (1, 7) aims for (5, 7), which is a good target, especially if E1 is now trapped on the left side near its new body segment (0, 6).\n\nHowever, we must consider the risk of E1 moving UP (1, 7). If E1 intended to block (0, 6) for us but not eat it, it might move UP to (1, 7) to secure a favorable position for (5, 7) or block our path.\n\nE1 is at (1, 6).\nA movement history that suggests E1 wants (5, 7): (2, 5) -> UP -> (2, 6) -> LEFT -> (1, 6). This path takes E1 slightly away from (5, 7) (Manhattan distance was 5, now 5). But if E1 is focused on (0, 6), it goes LEFT. If it's focused on blocking/winning positioning, it might go UP.\n\nIf E1 moves LEFT: E1 (0, 6), eats. I move RIGHT (1, 7). Safe.\nIf E1 moves UP: E1 (1, 7). I move RIGHT (1, 7). Death.\n\nIf I move UP (0, 8):\nIf E1 moves LEFT: E1 (0, 6), eats. I move UP (0, 8). Safe.\nIf E1 moves UP: E1 (1, 7). I move UP (0, 8). Safe.\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT or DOWN, both UP and RIGHT moves for me are safe this turn.\n\nLet's assume the rational enemy will pursue the immediate apple (0, 6) if it's open, which it is for E1 since E1 is adjacent.\n\n**Scenario: E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6) (EATS).**\n1. If I move UP to (0, 8): Safe. Next target (5, 7) is 7 steps away, or (0, 1) is 7 steps away. This seems poor.\n2. If I move RIGHT to (1, 7): Safe. Next target (5, 7) is 4 steps away. This puts us in a better position for the next apple.\n\n**Scenario: E1 moves UP to (1, 7). (Less likely if E1 is greedy for apples).**\n1. If I move UP to (0, 8): Safe. E1 takes position (1, 7).\n2. If I move RIGHT to (1, 7): Death.\n\nSince E1 just moved directly toward the apple cluster (0, 6) by moving LEFT to (1, 6), the highest probability is that E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6) to eat. In this case, moving RIGHT is the best positioning move.\n\nIf we cannot assume E1 is apple greedy, moving UP (0, 8) is the safest escape route that maintains control of the Y=0 column for (0, 1).\n\nHowever, the risk of E1 moving UP to sacrifice the apple AND cause a head-on collision is generally low in competitive Snake unless E1 is larger or trying to trap me. E1 is also length 1.\n\nI prioritize survival, but I also must capture apples efficiently. Since (0, 6) is almost certainly contested (and thus deadly if I move down), I pivot.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (1, 7), and E1 moves LEFT (0, 6), I gain 4 steps advantage on (5, 7) compared to moving UP.\n\nLet's re-run the risk analysis for RIGHT:\nE1 is at (1, 6). To move UP to (1, 7), E1 must have a reason not to take the immediate apple. Perhaps E1 assumes I will move DOWN and wants to block a path or race for (5, 7). If E1 moves UP, it is aiming for (5, 7) (Manhattan distance 4 from (1, 7)). If I move RIGHT, I am also aiming for (5, 7) (Manhattan distance 4 from (1, 7)). A duel over (1, 7) kills both of us for no immediate gain.\n\nIf I move UP (0, 8):\n*   If E1 moves LEFT (0, 6): E1 eats. I'm safe, position (0, 8). Next target (5, 7) is 7 steps away.\n*   If E1 moves UP (1, 7): E1 is safe, position (1, 7). I'm safe, position (0, 8). Next target (5, 7) is 4 steps away for E1, 7 steps away for me. E1 wins the race for (5, 7).\n\nIf I abandon the race for (5, 7) and focus on (0, 1), then moving UP (0, 8) seems fine. From (0, 8), (0, 1) is 7 steps.\n\nLet's stick to the high probability assessment: E1 moves LEFT to eat (0, 6).\n\nIf E1 eats (0, 6): E1 head (0, 6), E1 body (1, 6).\n*   My optimal move to minimize moves to next apple (5, 7) is RIGHT to (1, 7).\n*   From (1, 7), E1 is constrained: (0, 6) -> (1, 6) is its body. E1 can only move DOWN (0, 5) or LEFT (-1, 6) [oops, off board] or UP (0, 7). Wait, E1 head is (0, 6), body is (1, 6). E1 can move UP (0, 7), RIGHT (1, 6) [oops, into body], or LEFT (-1, 6) [oops, off board] or DOWN (0, 5). E1 can only move UP (0, 7) or DOWN (0, 5).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 7) and E1 moves LEFT to (0, 6):\nT=4: I am at (1, 7). E1 head (0, 6), body (1, 6).\nE1's safe moves next turn (T=5): (0, 7) or (0, 5).\nIf E1 moves (0, 7), I can move (2, 7) or (1, 8) or (1, 6).\nIf I move (2, 7), E1 is far away. (5, 7) is 3 steps away for me.\n\nThis looks like an excellent move, assuming E1 is greedy.\n\nIf E1 is instead defensive and moves UP to (1, 7), we die. This risk is real but low given immediate reward.\n\nHowever, if I assume E1 will block me from the center by moving UP to (1, 7), then I must move UP to (0, 8). Then E1 gets (1, 7), preparing for (5, 7).\n\nLet's prioritize: Survival > Eating apples.\n\nThe safest move is UP (0, 8). It guarantees survival while waiting to see E1's real intent. But it loses the race for (5, 7).\n\nWhat if I move DOWN (0, 6)? This is a 50/50 mutual death if E1 moves LEFT. Cannot justify this.\n\nI will take the safest path UP, accepting E1 will likely capture (0, 6) and gain a positional lead towards (5, 7). My strategy pivots to (0, 1) and hoping E1 gets tangled or distracted.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (0, 8) to observe E1's move regarding (0, 6). If E1 takes (0, 6), pivot to (0, 1) (7 steps away). If E1 does not take (0, 6) but moves to position (e.g., (1, 7)), we might still be able to grab (0, 6) on T=5 or T=6.\n\nUP",

Eliminate.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 8):** Safe.\n\n2. **Evaluate existing apples and enemy position:**\nApples: A1 (0, 1), A2 (8, 5), A3 (5, 7), A4 (9, 9), A5 (0, 6).\nMy position: (0, 8).\nE1 position: (1, 5).\n\nE1 moved DOWN, perhaps aiming for A2 (8, 5) or A1 (0, 1). E1 is 7 steps from A2 and 5 steps from A1. My distance to A1 is 7 steps. My distance to A5 (0, 6) is 2 steps. My distance to A3 (5, 7) is 6 steps.\n\nA5 (0, 6) is very close. E1 is at (1, 5), 2 steps away (R, D, L, U). 3 steps away: (1, 5) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6). E1 is 3 steps away. I am 2 steps away. I can reach it faster.\n\nIf I target (0, 6):\n*   **DOWN (0, 7):** T=5\n*   **DOWN (0, 6):** T=6 (EAT)\n\nIf E1 targets (0, 6):\n*   E1 (1, 5) -> (0, 5) [T=5, LEFT]\n*   E1 (0, 5) -> (0, 6) [T=6, UP]\n\nIf I move DOWN twice, I beat E1 to (0, 6), assuming E1 immediately starts moving towards it.\n\n3. **Check for T=5 collision threat if I move towards (0, 6):**\nMy move: DOWN (0, 7).\nE1 moves: E1 can move UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5).\nIf E1 moves UP to (1, 6), we are safe.\nIf E1 moves LEFT to (0, 5), we are safe.\nIf E1 moves DOWN or RIGHT, we are safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risk pursuing (0, 6) this turn.\n\n4. **Analyze possible moves based on target (0, 6):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN (0, 7):** Puts me one step closer to A5 (0, 6). Path: D, D (EAT). Distance to E1: (0, 7) vs (1, 5) -> 3 steps M. A good proactive move.\n\n*   **Move UP (0, 9):** Moves further away from all nearby resources. Not ideal unless forced by threat.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (1, 8):** Positions me for A3 (5, 7). Distance: 5 steps (4 R, 1 D, or 5 steps R, 1 D later).\n    *   (1, 8) -> (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7). 5 steps.\n    *   Distance to A3 (5, 7) from (0, 8) is 6 steps.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, E1 might pursue A3 (5, 7) from (1, 5). E1 distance to A3 is 5 steps (4 R, 1 U).\n    *   If I move RIGHT: I'm at (1, 8). E1 moves towards A3, say (2, 5). My distance to A3 is 5. E1's distance is 4. E1 leads the race.\n\n*   Moving to (0, 7) keeps options open for A5 (0, 6) or A1 (0, 1).\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\nThe apple at (0, 6) is the closest and I have a time advantage over the enemy to reach it, provided I start moving immediately. Moving DOWN to (0, 7) closes that distance without risking collision this turn.\n\nMove plan for (0, 6):\nT=5: DOWN to (0, 7).\nT=6: DOWN to (0, 6) (EAT).\n\nIf E1 moves to close to (0, 6), say LEFT to (0, 5):\nT=5: I (0, 7), E1 (0, 5). Safe.\nT=6: I (0, 6) EAT. E1: must move UP to (0, 6) -> Head-on collision!\n\nAh, I must factor in E1's simultaneous move on T=6.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7) on T=5:\nE1 is at (1, 5). E1 can move LEFT to (0, 5).\nIf E1 moves (0, 5) on T=5, then on T=6, E1 will move UP to target (0, 6).\nIf I move (0, 6) on T=6, it's a mutual kill.\n\nThis means I only have a *potential* 1 turn advantage if E1 is going elsewhere, but if E1 is aiming for (0, 6), it leads to death.\n\nLet's re-evaluate E1's likely intent. E1 moved (1, 6) -> (1, 5). It moved DOWN. This is not a direct path immediately toward (0, 6). It is 3 steps to (0, 6) from (1, 5). It is 5 steps to (0, 1) from (1, 5). It is 5 steps to (5, 7) from (1, 5).\n\nIf E1 is aiming for (0, 6) (3 steps): E1 moves LEFT -> UP.\nT=5: E1 (0, 5).\nT=6: E1 (0, 6).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 7):\nT=5: Me (0, 7).\nT=6: Me (0, 6).\n\nThis scenario (E1 targets (0, 6)) leads to a guaranteed head-on collision on T=6 if I pursue (0, 6). I cannot commit to (0, 6) unless E1 moves away from the 0 column.\n\nSince E1 just moved DOWN, perhaps it's aiming for A1 (0, 1) or A2 (8, 5).\nIf E1 aims for A1 (0, 1): 5 steps. Path: (1, 5) -> L(0, 5) -> D(0, 4) -> D(0, 3) -> D(0, 2) -> D(0, 1) (EAT @ T=9).\nIf E1 aims for A2 (8, 5): 7 steps. Path: (1, 5) -> R x 7. (EAT @ T=12).\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT towards A2 (8, 5): E1 (2, 5).\nI move DOWN (0, 7). Safe. Now (0, 6) is open for T=6.\n\nIf E1 moves DOWN towards A1 (0, 1): E1 (1, 4).\nI move DOWN (0, 7). Safe. Now (0, 6) is open for T=6.\n\nIf E1 moves UP: E1 (1, 6).\nI move DOWN (0, 7). Safe. Still a risk for T=6 collision if E1 moves L(0, 6).\n\nIf E1 moves LEFT: E1 (0, 5).\nI move DOWN (0, 7). Collision risk on T=6.\n\nThe risk of E1 moving to (0, 5) is high because it is the start of a clear path to (0, 1) or a pivot for (0, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (1, 8):\nI am safe from any immediate move E1 makes. I pivot to A3 (5, 7).\nMy distance to A3: 5 steps (Target T=10).\nE1 distance to A3: 5 steps. E1 can get there just as fast or faster depending on path, e.g. (1, 5) -> U(1, 6) -> U(1, 7) -> R(2, 7) -> R(3, 7) -> R(4, 7) -> R(5, 7). (6 steps total).\nWait, M.D. (1, 5) to (5, 7) is 4+2=6.\n(1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7). 6 steps.\nIf E1 moves R(2, 5) on T=5, then E1 is 5 steps away. (T=10 EAT).\n\nMy move RIGHT (1, 8):\nT=5: Me (1, 8). MD to (5, 7) is 5 steps.\nT=10 EAT minimum.\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT (2, 5):\nT=5: E1 (2, 5). MD to (5, 7) is 5 steps.\nT=10 EAT minimum.\n\nIf we both commit to (5, 7), we will enter the area near the same time. This is risky, but potentially unavoidable if E1 pivots away from the 0-column.\n\nIf I move UP (0, 9):\nI am safe. Distances don't change much. I am very far from the action.\n\nThe most valuable, least contested apple is likely (5, 7) if E1 continues moving away from it.\n\nGiven E1 is at (1, 5), if it moves LEFT to (0, 5) it immediately sets up a dangerous T=6 collision at (0, 6), or commits to (0, 1). This is its highest priority move if it wants an apple immediately.\n\nIf E1 moves LEFT (0, 5), I must not move DOWN.\nIf I move RIGHT (1, 8), I am safe.\nIf E1 moves LEFT (0, 5), E1 risks collision with me at (0, 6) on T=6, but I successfully claim the outside path to (5, 7).\n\nI will prioritize position for A3 (5, 7) and A2 (8, 5). Moving RIGHT (1, 8) opens up the board for me and away from E1's projected path towards A1/(0, 6) area.\n\nLong-term plan: Move right towards (5, 7). If E1 takes (0, 6) or commits to (0, 1), continue right. If E1 also pivots right, look to outmaneuver or secure A2 (8, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

INSTANT DEATH.\n    *   If E1 moves elsewhere (D, L, R) $\\rightarrow$ Safe.\n    *   Since E1 just moved UP and is likely trying to close the distance/move towards the upper apples, moving DOWN into its path is extremely risky. **Eliminate DOWN.**\n\n2. **If I move LEFT (0, 8):**\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT (0, 6) $\\rightarrow$ E1 eats A5. Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT $\\rightarrow$ Safe for me.\n    *   This is a safe move, but it retreats and gives up positioning for A3/A4.\n\n3. **If I move UP (1, 9):**\n    *   Safe from E1 collision entirely on T=6, as E1 cannot reach (1, 9).\n    *   Moves towards A4 (9, 9).\n\n4. **If I move RIGHT (2, 8):**\n    *   Safe from E1 collision entirely on T=6, as E1 cannot block (2, 8) and E1 cannot jump to my side.\n    *   Commits to the path for A3 (5, 7) and A4 (9, 9).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nE1's move to (1, 6) on T=5 indicates a clear possibility of E1 aiming for A5 (0, 6) or continuing UP for A3/A4.\n\n*   If E1 targets A5 (0, 6) (moves LEFT): E1 gets the apple. I should preserve general positioning. Moving RIGHT (2, 8) sets me up for A3.\n*   If E1 targets A3 (5, 7) (moves RIGHT to (2, 6)): E1 is at (2, 6), I am at (2, 8). We are vertically aligned, 2 steps apart, both racing towards X=5.

I am safe from E1's possible UP move on T=6, and I will be positioned 2 steps above E1 if it moves RIGHT.\n\nLet's commit to A3/A4 via the RIGHT move, as it maintains the safest and most aggressive positioning without risking immediate collision like DOWN, or retreating like LEFT.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 8) maintains a strong, forward position, advancing towards the valuable central apple (5, 7) while avoiding E1's immediate vicinity.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** Continue moving RIGHT aggressively, aiming for A3 (5, 7).

E1 just ate an apple (0, 6) on the previous turn, meaning its body length is now 2 (head at (0, 6), body segment at (1, 6)). E1 is now facing UP or DOWN. If it moved LEFT to eat the apple, the previous position would have been (1, 6). Wait, the last turn recap shows E1 Head: (0, 6), Body: [(1, 6)].\n\n*Let's reconstruct E1's move history:*\nT=5: E1 Head at (1, 6). (Last known position where I started thinking).\nT=6: E1 moved LEFT to (0, 6) and ate the apple previously at (0, 6). Since E1 ate an apple, (1, 6) became the new tail/body segment, and its length increased.\n\nE1's safe moves from (0, 6):\n1. UP (0, 7): Safe.\n2. DOWN (0, 5): Safe.\n3. LEFT (-1, X): Off board. Death.\n4. RIGHT (1, 6): Hits its own body (1, 6). Death (moving backwards). **Wait, this is incorrect.** Its body segment is at (1, 6). Moving to (1, 6) is moving onto its own body *unless* the tail moves out. Since E1 just ate an apple, its body stays in place. Moving to (1, 6) is impossible. E1 must move UP, DOWN.\n\nHowever, if E1 did not grow (if the apple was *not* at (0, 6) but A5 was listed at (0, 6) previously and E1 moved there), we need to confirm the growth for E1.\nThe turn 6 snapshot said:\nApples at: (0, 1), (8, 5), (5, 7), (9, 9), (0, 6)\nOn T=6, E1 moved from (1, 6) LEFT to (0, 6), eating the apple.\nNew state (T=7): E1 Head: (0, 6), Body: [(1, 6)], Apples: 1. This confirms E1 grew and has a body segment at (1, 6).\n\nTherefore, E1's viable moves: UP (0, 7) or DOWN (0, 5).\n\n**My Snake Analysis:**\nMy Head: (2, 8). Body: none.\nMy safe moves from (2, 8):\n1. UP (2, 9): Safe.\n2. DOWN (2, 7): Safe.\n3. LEFT (1, 8): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 8): Safe.\n\n**Contested Apples:**\nWe are aiming for the nearest apples: A5 (4, 8) and A3 (5, 7). A4 (9, 9) is also high prize.\n\n1. **A5 (4, 8): New nearest apple.**\n   Me: (2, 8) -> R(3, 8) -> R(4, 8). **2 steps minimum.** Reaching T=9.\n   E1: (0, 6) -> U (0, 7) -> U (0, 8) -> R (1, 8) -> R (2, 8) -> R (3, 8) -> R (4, 8). **6 steps minimum.** I have a massive advantage here. This should be my priority.\n\n2. **A3 (5, 7):**\n   Me: (2, 8) -> R(3, 8) -> R(4, 8) -> D(4, 7) -> R(5, 7). 4 steps. (If I move straight to A5 first, the path changes slightly).\n   If I go for (4, 8) first, T=9 I am at (4, 8). Then (4, 7) -> (5, 7). Reach T=11.\n   E1: (0, 6) -> U(0, 7) -> R * 5 -> (5, 7). 6 steps minimum.\n   I am faster to A3 as well, but A5 is closer.\n\n3. **A4 (9, 9):**\n   Me: (2, 8) -> U(2, 9) -> R * 7. 8 steps minimum.\n   E1: (0, 6) -> U(0, 7) -> U(0, 8) -> U(0, 9) -> R * 9. 12 steps minimum.\n\n**Decision based on immediate goal (A5 at (4, 8)):**\nThe best way to reach A5 (4, 8) is to move RIGHT.\n\nMove choice: RIGHT (2, 8) -> (3, 8).\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on or into E1 body):**\nMy move: (3, 8).\nE1 potential moves (UP to (0, 7) or DOWN to (0, 5)):\n*   If E1 moves UP to (0, 7). No collision.\n*   If E1 moves DOWN to (0, 5). No collision.\n*   E1 body is at (1, 6). (3, 8) is far away. Safe.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\nWhat happens if I move UP (2, 9) or LEFT (1, 8) or DOWN (2, 7)?\n*   UP (2, 9): Ignores A5, focusing on A4. Too slow, A5 is an easy point.\n*   LEFT (1, 8): Retreats, giving up crucial positioning near A5 and A3.\n*   DOWN (2, 7): Safe from E1 (E1 is moving vertically in x=0 column). But moves away from A5 (4, 8) in Y=8.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 8) is the optimal move:\n1. It moves directly towards the closest, uncontested apple (A5 at 4, 8).\n2. It maintains safety from E1, which is trapped in column X=0 or X=1 due to its body segment [(1, 6)].\n3. It keeps me well-positioned for A3 (5, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\nT=7: Move RIGHT to (3, 8).\nT=8: Move RIGHT to (4, 8) and eat A5. This will guarantee my first apple and growth, securing the middle area.\nThen proceed towards A3 (5, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

Death.\n*   RIGHT (1, 3): Safe.\n\nE1's viable moves: DOWN (0, 2) or RIGHT (1, 3). E1 is very far and irrelevant to my immediate move.\n\n**3. Evaluate Optimal Move for ID 0 (at 4, 7):**\n\nI must choose between A3 (RIGHT to 5, 7) and A5 (LEFT to 3, 7). Both yield an apple in T=10.\n\n*If I move LEFT to (3, 7) [A5]:*\nHead (3, 7), Body (4, 7), (4, 8). Length increases to 3.\n\n*If I move RIGHT to (5, 7) [A3]:*\nHead (5, 7), Body (4, 7), (4, 8). Length increases to 3.\n\nBoth moves are equally beneficial in terms of immediate apple gain. I should look at which move maintains better future opportunities for the remaining apples: (0, 1), (8, 5), (9, 9).\n\nIf I go LEFT (3, 7): I am positioned near the left/center of the board. I am slightly closer to A1 (0, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT (5, 7): I am positioned near the right/center of the board. I am optimally positioned to pursue A2 (8, 5) or A4 (9, 9).\n\nA2 (8, 5) requires approximately 3 steps (e.g., R, D, R) or 4 steps.\nA4 (9, 9) requires approximately 6 steps.\n\nA1 (0, 1) requires approximately 5-6 steps.\n\nMoving RIGHT (to 5, 7) sets me up better for the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (A2, A4) should the remaining apple (3, 7) be eaten by someone else or taken by me later. Since the right side is less congested by E1, it seems like a slightly more advantageous area to control.\n\nTherefore, going for A3 (5, 7) via **RIGHT** is slightly preferred for positioning for subsequent apples (8, 5) and (9, 9).\n\n**4. Final Check:**\nMove: RIGHT to (5, 7). Apple collected. Safe move. No potential collision.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nT=10: Move RIGHT to (5, 7) to collect A3. Head at (5, 7).\nT=11: Reassess whether A5 (3, 7) is still available. If so, move towards it (L, L). If not, pursue A2 (8, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Distance increases to 4 moves (e.g., U, U, R, R).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 7) is the best choice to advance towards (6, 8).\n\n**3.

Tail at (4, 8).\nFrom (5, 7), I will have moves: UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7 - safe as old head/new tail), RIGHT (6, 7).\nTo reach (6, 8), the most critical step is moving UP to (5, 8) next turn, or RIGHT to (6, 7) and then UP. Since (5, 8) is currently empty, moving UP next turn looks good.\n\n**4. Evaluate Collision Risk with Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 2). Its body is [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. Tail at (1, 1).\nSnake 1 is likely targeting A3 (5, 2) (distance 2) or A5 (1, 4) (distance 4).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1: UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1 - into neck, DEATH), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2).\nWait, Snake 1's head is (3, 2) and its neck is (3, 1). So moving DOWN (3, 1) is instant death.\nSafe moves for S1: UP (3, 3), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2).\n\n*   If S1 moves UP (3, 3): Closest to A5 (1, 4) and A3 (5, 2). No collision risk with my RIGHT move to (5, 7).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT (2, 2): Moving towards A5 (1, 4). No collision risk.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT (4, 2): Moving towards A3 (5, 2). No collision risk.\n\nNo immediate collision risk is foreseen. My path remains clear.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7) to advance towards the apple at (6, 8).\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note for T=17:**\nT=17: Be at (5, 7), length 4. Target A4 (6, 8).\nPath: (5, 7) -> (5, 8) [UP] -> (6, 8) [RIGHT].\n(5, 8) is safe from my body (tail at 4, 8). I will check for enemy presence at (5, 8) next turn. If (5, 8) is safe, move UP.

Next turn, I plan to move UP to (6, 8) and eat the apple.\n\nBoth moves are equally effective regarding the immediate goal A4 (6, 8).\n\n**5. Choosing based on Future Position/Safety:**\n\n*A) If I move UP to (5, 8):*\nMy body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. Tail (3, 8).\nNext turn (T=18) from (5, 8).

Safe moves: U/D/L/R.\nTo eat A4, I move UP to (6, 8).\n\nPosition (5, 8) keeps me centered and slightly closer to A2 (9, 9) if I fail to get A4. Position (6, 7) is slightly less central.\n\nSince A4 (6, 8) is in the top right quadrant, moving UP to (5, 8) seems like a slightly better orientation for future plays, as it places me adjacent to the top edge and directly aligned with the final step to A4.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: reach A4 (6, 8). UP to (5, 8) leads directly to the apple in the next turn.\n\n**6. Final Check for Traps/Enemy:**\nS1 is far away and moving south/east to (5, 2).

DEATH.\n*   S1 RIGHT (6, 2): Safe, general maneuvering.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** S1 moves DOWN to (5, 1) and eats Apple A5.\nS1 New Head: (5, 1). S1 New Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]. Length 6.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation:**\nMy move RIGHT to (6, 8) is safe from S1, as S1 is likely moving DOWN to (5, 1).\nI will eat the apple, grow to length 5, and tie the score at 4 apples each.\n\n**5. Alternative Moves (if RIGHT was blocked):**\nN/A. RIGHT is the optimal move. UP (5, 9) or LEFT (4, 8) would move me away from the current closest apple.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note for T=19:**\nT=19: I will be at (6, 8), length 5, having eaten A3.\nS1 is expected to be at (5, 1), length 6, having eaten A5.\nRemaining closest major cluster of apples: A1 (8, 5) (distance 3) and A2 (9, 9) (distance 4). A4 (1, 4) is distance 6.\nI should aim for A1 (8, 5) or A2 (9, 9). Given my current position (6, 8), A2 (9, 9) is slightly more appealing as it's closer to the edge and gives me perimeter control, but (8, 5) is also reachable quickly. I will prioritize A2 (9, 9) unless S1 looks like a major threat to it.\n\nRIGHT",

Bad.\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (6, 7):** Sets up a move LEFT/DOWN next turn. (6, 7) -> (5, 7) is blocked by my body. (6, 7) -> (4, 7) is blocked by my body. From (6, 7), I can only go RIGHT (7, 7) or DOWN (6, 6). This effectively traps me away from the body block at (5, 8)/(5, 7). This is highly restrictive.\n*   **Option C: Move UP (6, 9):** This allows me to arc around my body to the LEFT, aiming for (5, 9) or (4, 9) next turn, putting me in a good position to reach A5 (3, 8).

DEATH. (S1's neck is now (5, 2) since S1 ate at (5, 1) and grew). WAIT. S1's body segments after eating at (5, 1) are: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)]. The tail is now at (2, 1) and will move to (3, 1) if no apple is eaten.\n    *   S1 Head: (5, 1)\n    *   S1 Neck: (5, 2)\n    *   S1 must avoid (5, 2).\n*   S1 DOWN (5, 0): Safe.\n*   S1 LEFT (4, 1): Safe. Moves toward A3 (1, 4).\n*   S1 RIGHT (6, 1): Safe.\n\nIf S1 aims for A3 (1, 4), S1 will move LEFT (4, 1). If S1 aims for A4 (5, 5), S1 might move UP (5, 2 is blocked) -> move LEFT (4, 1) or RIGHT (6, 1) to maneuver up the board.\n\nSince (5, 2) is blocked, S1 is forced to move LEFT (4, 1), RIGHT (6, 1) or DOWN (5, 0).\nIf S1 goes LEFT (4, 1), S1 aims for A3 (1, 4).\nIf S1 goes RIGHT (6, 1), S1 is trying to get around/up. S1 would be at (6, 1).\nIf S1 goes DOWN (5, 0), S1 is stalling/moving away.\n\nS1 is not a threat to A5 (3, 8) this turn or the next few turns. My move choice should be based purely on optimal pathing to A5 (3, 8).\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMoving UP to (6, 9) is the cleanest way to bypass my own neck segment (5, 8) and initiate the arc toward A5 (3, 8), which is the closest apple.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note for T=20:**\nT=20: I will be at (6, 9).

Tail is (5, 8).\nAt T=24, (9, 8) becomes head. Body shifts. (5, 8) will be free. (6, 8) will become the new tail.\nSo at T=26, if I move (7, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8), I would run into my own (new) tail segment (6, 8), if no apple is eaten. That is dangerous.\n\nSince S1 is committed to the right side and appears to be racing for A1 (8, 5), I should pivot to A4 (3, 8) or A3 (5, 5). A4 (3, 8) is significantly closer than A3 (5, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize the path to A4 (3, 8) while monitoring the tail position.\n\nT=23: Move DOWN to (9, 8).\nT=24: Move LEFT to (8, 8).\nT=25: Move LEFT to (7, 8).\nT=26: Move LEFT to (6, 8).\nTail position at T=26:\nWe moved 3 times without eating. The snake length is still 6.\nT=23 Head (9, 8). Tail (6, 8).\nT=24 Head (8, 8). Tail (7, 9).\nT=25 Head (7, 8). Tail (8, 9).\nT=26 Head (6, 8). Tail (9, 9).\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8) at T=26, that spot (6, 8) is empty, and the new tail will be (7, 9). My body segments will prevent movement to (7, 8) or (5, 8), but (6, 8) is fine if it's the tail movement spot OR far enough away.\nLet's trace the body list explicitly for T=23 to T=26, assuming no apples eaten.\nInitial T=23 (before move): H(9, 9). B: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8)].\n\nT=23 Move DOWN: H(9, 8). B: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)]. Tail (6, 8).\nT=24 Move LEFT: H(8, 8). B: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]. Tail (6, 9).\nT=25 Move LEFT: H(7, 8). B: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. Tail (7, 9).\nT=26 Move LEFT: H(6, 8). B: [(7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. Tail (8, 9).\n\n(6, 8) is safe to enter at T=26. I must continue the path towards A4 (3, 8).\nT=27: (6, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8). Safe.\nT=28: (5, 8) $\\to$ (4, 8). Safe.\nT=29: (4, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8). EAT A4!\n\nThis path (9, 8) $\\to$ (8, 8) $\\to$ (7, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8) $\\to$ (5, 8) $\\to$ (4, 8) $\\to$ (3, 8) is solid and avoids S1.\n\n**5. Final Decision for T=23:**\nThe only safe move is DOWN.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note for T=24:**\nS1 seems committed to A1 (8, 5), reaching it likely T=25. I cannot race S1 there.\nI must target A4 (3, 8), which takes 6 turns.\nT=23: (9, 9) $\\to$ (9, 8) [DOWN].\nT=24: Target LEFT to (8, 8).\nT=25: Target LEFT (7, 8).\n... continue left until near A4, then re-evaluate.\nI will monitor S1's move, but based on S1 moving UP to (8, 2), they are likely going (8, 3) next towards A1.\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

I am currently at (7, 8), moving effectively towards it.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves from (7, 8):**\nThe coordinates occupied by my body (after my last move, new tail) are: (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9). Note that the coordinate (7, 9) is the new tail and will be vacated this turn unless I eat an apple. Since my previous move did not result in an apple, the tail segment (7, 9) will be vacated and is a safe move space.\n\n*   **Move UP (7, 9):** Safe. (This cell was the tail of the snake before the move, and since no apple was eaten, the tail (7, 9) will move to (8, 9) or (9, 9) depending on which segment it connects to, but the current tail *was* (7, 9). Wait, let's re-verify the body list ordering *from* the input: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]. The last segment is (7, 9). If I move, (7, 9) is vacated. **Safe.**\n*   **Move DOWN (7, 7):** Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (6, 8):** Safe. This is the optimal path to A3 (3, 8).\n*   **Move RIGHT (8, 8):** Into my body (the segment right behind my neck). **DEATH.** Segment (8, 8) is the first body segment.\n\nSafe moves remain: UP (7, 9), DOWN (7, 7), LEFT (6, 8).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (Snake #1):**\nS1 is at (8, 5). S1 is now the longer snake and has the lead in apples (6 vs 5).\nPossible targets for S1: A2 (5, 5), A5 (9, 1).\nS1's current position (8, 5) suggests movement towards A2 (5, 5) or perhaps down towards A5 (9, 1).\n\n*   S1's safe moves from (8, 5): UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4\u2014vacated tail), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5).\n*   If S1 targets A2 (5, 5): S1 will move LEFT (7, 5) or LEFT again (6, 5).\n*   If S1 targets A5 (9, 1): S1 will move RIGHT (9, 5) or DOWN (8, 4).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (7, 8):**\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 8):** Continues the trajectory towards A3 (3, 8). This is 3 moves away. Optimal path. Distance (Manhattan) to A3: 4.\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** Moves away from A3. Would set me up for targeting A2 (5, 5) eventually, but that's currently closer to S1.\n*   **UP (7, 9):** Moves further away from all nearby accessible apples, putting me near the wall. Suboptimal.\n\n**4. Collision Check/Risk Assessment:**\n\n*   My intended move: LEFT to (6, 8).\n*   S1's likely moves (7, 5) or (8, 6).\n*   The paths do not currently intersect. Moving LEFT (6, 8) is safe and maintains aggression towards my target apple A3 (3, 8).\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Confirmation:**\nContinue pursuing A3 (3, 8).\n\nT=26: (7, 8) $\\to$ (6, 8) [LEFT].\nT=27: Target LEFT (5, 8).\nT=28: Target LEFT (4, 8).\nT=29: Target LEFT (3, 8).

If S1 commits to the right side, A4 (0, 3) provides the best safe accumulation.\n\nLEFT",

Manhattan distance M=4.\nA3 (0, 3): distance 5 (L, D, D, D, L or D, L, D, D, L). Manhattan distance M=4.\n\nS1 will likely be moving toward the center or left side. I should prioritize A1 (1, 4) as it is slightly more central than A3 (0, 3) and might bring S1 closer. A move like DOWN (3, 7) or DOWN (2, 8) then DOWN (1, 8) would be good to reposition toward (1, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for T=30:**\nAfter eating A2 at (3, 8), prioritize apple A1 (1, 4) to maintain pressure on S1 and contest the left side of the board.

(2, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4). This takes longer to get into the crucial central Y-levels.\n*   **Move UP (3, 9):** Moves away from all close apples (1, 4), (0, 3), (2, 4). Only useful if I decide to go for A4 (9, 6) and circle around the top, but (3, 9) is still too far left for that. Avoid UP.\n\n**S0 Decision: Move DOWN (3, 7).** This is the most efficient path to reach A5 (2, 4) and A1 (1, 4), which are the critical, contested apples right now.\n\n**Checking collision risk if I move DOWN (3, 7):**\nS1 is at (5, 6).\nS1 is too far away to hit (3, 7) or (3, 8) this turn.

(5, 6) is the neck. Moving to (5, 6) is immediate death.\n2. (6, 5) is also in the body. Moving to (6, 5) is death.\n\nS1 safe moves: UP (6, 7), RIGHT (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves UP (6, 7), it is targeting A4 (9, 6).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (7, 6), it is targeting A4 (9, 6).\n\nIt is highly likely S1 prioritizes A4 (9, 6) since it is only 3 steps away via RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, or 3 steps via UP, R, R, R.\nPath (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6). (3 moves)\n\n**4. S0 Selection based on S1's probable movement:**\nSince S1 is pinned to moving UP or RIGHT, both taking S1 *away* from the contested left cluster (A1, A5), I have a clear path to pursue A5 (2, 4) without immediate conflict.\n\nComparing DOWN (3, 6) and LEFT (2, 7):\n*   Moving DOWN keeps me further away (Y axis) from S1's predicted path (Y=6 or Y=7).\n*   Moving LEFT (2, 7) keeps me at Y=7, which is next to S1's potential location (6, 7).\n\nWhile unlikely to collide, moving DOWN (3, 6) maintains the most flexible central position for moving toward the apples (L, D, D, D) and sets up a clear path for future turns.\n(3, 7) -> DOWN -> (3, 6) (M=3 to A5) -> LEFT -> (2, 6) (M=2 to A5) -> DOWN -> (2, 5) (M=1 to A5) -> DOWN -> (2, 4) (EAT!) (4 turns total)\n\nIf I move LEFT:\n(3, 7) -> LEFT -> (2, 7) (M=3 to A5) -> DOWN -> (2, 6) (M=2 to A5) -> DOWN -> (2, 5) (M=1 to A5) -> DOWN -> (2, 4) (EAT!) (4 turns total)\n\nBoth yield 4 turns to eat A5. I will choose LEFT (2, 7) as it positions me slightly better horizontally for the immediate target (2, 4) and opens the option to go for (1, 4) or (0, 3) subsequently.\n\nIf I move LEFT (2, 7), my primary path is D, D, D.\nIf I move RIGHT (4, 7), M to A5 is 5. Less optimal.\n\nI choose LEFT (2, 7).\n\n**Collision Check (S0: (2, 7), S1: (7, 6) or (6, 7))**\nIf S1 moves UP (6, 7), we are not close.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (7, 6), we are not close.\nNo collision risk.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T=32 onwards:**\nSecure A5 (2, 4) in the next 3 turns. If S1 is preoccupied with A4 (9, 6), I should immediately pivot focus to A1 (1, 4) or A2 (0, 3). Focus on moving DOWN and LEFT over the next few turns.\n\nLEFT",

S1's body segments are dense in the (5-9, 5-7) range.\nS1's tail is (6, 5), which is currently occupied.\nS1 Safe Moves from (9, 6):\n*   UP (9, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (9, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 6): Into body. **DEATH.**\n*   RIGHT (10, 6): Off board. **DEATH.**\n\nS1 will move UP or DOWN.\nIf S1 moves UP, it approaches (9, 7). From there, it might look towards A4 (4, 6) or A5 (5, 4).\nIf S1 moves DOWN, it approaches (9, 5) or (9, 4). It might then go for A3 (9, 1).\n\nOverall, S1 is far away, and there is no immediate collision risk for me.\n\n**4. Final Selection:**\nI need to move towards A2 (0, 3). Moving DOWN (1, 3) or LEFT (0, 4) achieves this equally well.\n\nLet's pick **DOWN** to slightly favor the lower apples A2 (0, 3) and A6 (0, 1).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T=37 onwards:**\nT=37: Head at (1, 3). Target A2 (0, 3). Move LEFT to eat A2. Length 10.\nT=38: Head at (0, 3). Target A6 (0, 1).

Since the move calculation is based on the state *before* the move is executed, let's re-verify the current board state based on the provided information.\n\n**Current State (Turn 37 start):**\nMy snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (1, 3) (Assuming the previous move DOWN from (1, 4) was successful)\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)] (9 segments total, since the previous move ate an apple at T=36, the tail (4, 8) remains occupied).\nMy full body segments (Head included): (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n\nApples: (0, 3) (Target A1), (9, 1), (5, 4), (0, 1), (4, 6).\n\nWait, the apple list and my head position are crucial.\nMy head is at (1, 3). The apple list shows (0, 3) is an apple location.\n\nIf my head is (1, 3), I did *not* eat an apple this turn (T=37), because the closest apple was (0, 3). My previous move (T=36) was DOWN from (1, 4) to (1, 3). The board state confirmation shows (1, 3) is empty, and (0, 3) is an apple.\n\nIf I did *not* eat an apple on the previous turn (T=36), my tail (4, 8) would free up.\nHowever, I look back at the *last move information* provided for Turn 36:\n\"My segments: (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8).\nThe previous move was LEFT, *eating the apple at (1, 4)*.

Since I just moved to (1, 3) without eating, my old tail (4, 8) should be freeing up.\nThe *list* provided for the body doesn't include the previous total length, so I must rely on the movement dynamics.\nT=36: Head was (1, 4). Move DOWN to (1, 3). No apple at (1, 3).\nTherefore, my tail (4, 8) *did* free up.\nMy occupied segments: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8).

Evaluate Apple Proximity and Pathing:**\nThe closest apple is A1 (0, 3). Moving LEFT immediately secures this apple. This is the top priority.\n\n**Snake #1 Analysis (Head: (9, 5))**\nS1 moved from (9, 6) to (9, 5). S1 did not eat an apple (no apple at (9, 5)). S1 length remains 8 (1 + 7 body segments, tail position (5, 5) frees up).\nS1 segments: (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6).\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (9, 5):\n*   UP (9, 6): Into body. **DEATH.**\n*   DOWN (9, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 5): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (10, 5): Off board. **DEATH.**\n\nS1 might target A3 (9, 1) or A5 (5, 4) or A4 (4, 6).\nDistance to A3 (9, 1): M=4 (straight DOWN).\nDistance to A5 (5, 4): M=5 (LEFT 4, UP 1).\nDistance to A4 (4, 6): M=6.\n\nS1 is likely to move DOWN towards (9, 4) or LEFT towards (8, 5). Neither direction poses a collision risk for me, established at (1, 3), especially as I target (0, 3).\n\n**3. Final Decision:**\nThe optimal move is clearly LEFT to eat the apple at (0, 3). This will increase my score to 9, length to 10, giving me a score lead (or maintaining the tie if S1 also ate, but S1 didn't).\n\n**Plan for Next Turns (T=38 onwards):**\nHead moves to (0, 3).

This is distant from me, and there is no collision risk.\n\n**4. Final Plan and Rationale**\n\nI must move RIGHT to eat the apple at (1, 1). This will bring my apple count to 12 (10 apples + 2 this turn cycle).\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\nNew Head: (1, 1). New length: 12.\nRemaining Targets: (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 7).

My next move should be aimed at moving towards the center of the board, likely UP to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 1). (1, 2) is a good vertical path to intercept (5, 4) or (4, 6).\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nMove RIGHT to eat (1, 1).\n\n**Plan for Next Turns (T=41 onwards):**\nT=41: Head will be at (1, 1). Start moving towards the central apples, (5, 4) or (4, 6). Move UP (1, 2) seems safest and prepares for either target.\nT=42: From (1, 2), move UP (1, 3) or RIGHT (2, 2) depending on S1's relative position, though S1 is still far right.

My previous snake length was 11, now it is 12 (11 body segments + 1 head). The tail segment at (3, 8) is NOT freed up.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (ID 1) Head: (9, 1).\nS1 appears to have moved DOWN from (9, 2) to (9, 1), eating the apple that was at (9, 1). S1's previous length was 10, now it is 11. S1's tail at (7, 6) is NOT freed up.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (1, 1))**\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 2):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (1, 0):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 1):** Into my body. **DEATH.** (This is the neck segment).\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 1):** Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Proximity and Pathing**\n\nThe apples are distributed towards the center-right of the board:\nA1: (5, 4) - M=5\nA2: (4, 6) - M=8\nA3: (6, 7) - M=11\nA4: (8, 2) - M=8\nA5: (8, 9) - M=15\n\nMy head is at (1, 1), near the bottom left corner. I need to move towards the center (x=4 to x=6, y=4 to y=6).\n\nComparing the closest apples: (5, 4) and (4, 6).\n*   If I aim for (5, 4), I need to increase both X and Y.\n*   If I aim for (4, 6), I need to increase both X and Y significantly.\n\nPathing considerations:\n1.  **Move UP to (1, 2):** Keeps me along the left side of my current body segments (0, 2), (0, 3). This is generally a good path to move up the board towards (4, 6) or (5, 4).\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (2, 1):** Starts moving me horizontally, which also helps reach (5, 4) or (8, 2) (M=8).\n3.  **Move DOWN to (1, 0):** Moves away from all apples. Avoid unless forced.\n\nThe center of the board is slightly safer and more open than the edges, especially as my snake is now R-shaped in the bottom left. Moving UP to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 1) are both good starting points.\n\nLet's evaluate two primary paths:\n\n*   **Path A (Towards 4, 6 / 5, 4 via UP):** (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> ...\n    *   (1, 2) is a safe, clear path. It puts me one step closer to clearing the congestion around (0, 2), (0, 3) and allows for subsequent rightward movement.\n\n*   **Path B (Towards 5, 4 / 8, 2 via RIGHT):** (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> ...\n    *   (2, 1) is also safe. It prioritizes X movement first.\n\nSince (4, 6) (M=8) and (5, 4) (M=5) are the closest, and (5, 4) is relatively accessible via increasing X and Y, let's see which starting move facilitates this best.\n\n(1, 1) -> (2, 1) [RIGHT]\nFuture moves: (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4) (6 steps).\n\n(1, 1) -> (1, 2) [UP]\nFuture moves: (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4) (6 steps).\n\nThe path length is the same. The difference lies in maintaining space flexibility. My current body occupies (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), etc.\nIf I move UP, (1, 2) is open. My neck is (0, 1). This keeps my body structure largely intact along the y=0 column.\nIf I move RIGHT, (2, 1) is open.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 2) avoids getting too close to the body structure that runs (1, 3), (1, 4), and allows me to clear the cluster of my own segments at (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3) by moving to X=1 or X=2 later.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (9, 1))**\n\nS1's current head is (9, 1). S1 is still far to the right, near the border.\nS1 Safe Moves from (9, 1):\n*   UP (9, 2): Safe (into its own neck, but since it ate an apple, (9, 2) is part of its body for this turn). **DEATH.**\n*   DOWN (9, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT: Off board. DEATH.\n\nS1 will likely move DOWN to (9, 0) or LEFT to (8, 1) to navigate the board. If it moves LEFT (8, 1), it might aim for (8, 2) (M=1).\n\n**4. Considering Potential Collisions**\n\nS1 is at (9, 1). The closest apple S1 might target is (8, 2) (M=2, via (8, 1)).\nIf I move UP (1, 2) or RIGHT (2, 1), I am nowhere near S1. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**5. Long Term Strategy Refinement**\n\nSince (5, 4) is the closest apple (M=5), and the path is clear, I will prioritize moving towards the center of the board.\n\nIf I choose UP (1, 2):\nT=42 options: RIGHT (2, 2), UP (1, 3) (into body!), LEFT (0, 2) (into body!), DOWN (1, 1) (into body, as tail hasn't moved).\nWait, I ate an apple, so my tail (3, 8) is *not* freed up. My body segments are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), ...\nIf I move UP to (1, 2):\n*   (1, 3) is a body segment. Do not move there.\n*   (0, 2) is a body segment. Do not move there.\n*   (1, 1) will be my previous head position, which becomes a body segment. Do not move there.\n*   (2, 2) is safe.\n\nSo, if I move UP (1, 2), my only safe follow-up move is RIGHT (2, 2). This essentially locks me into a UP-RIGHT L-turn.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (2, 1):\nT=42 options: UP (2, 2), DOWN (2, 0), RIGHT (3, 1), LEFT (1, 1) (into body).\nIf I move RIGHT (2, 1), my safe follow-up moves are UP (2, 2), DOWN (2, 0), RIGHT (3, 1). Much better flexibility.\n\nLet's re-examine the target (5, 4).\nFrom (1, 1) -> (2, 1) [R] -> (3, 1) [R] -> (4, 1) [R] -> (4, 2) [U] -> (5, 2) [R] -> (5, 3) [U] -> (5, 4) [U] - 7 steps.\nFrom (1, 1) -> (2, 1) [R] -> (2, 2) [U] -> (3, 2) [R] -> (4, 2) [R] -> (5, 2) [R] -> (5, 3) [U] -> (5, 4) [U] - 7 steps.\n\nR-U path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2). This puts me in a good central position and maintains maximal escape routes for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (2, 1) is the preferred choice for flexibility and targeting the center of the board where most apples reside.\n\n**6. Final Decision**\nMove RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns (T=42 onwards):**\nT=42: Head at (2, 1). Move UP to (2, 2) to continue gaining altitude towards (5, 4) or (4, 6).\nT=43: From (2, 2), move RIGHT to (3, 2) or UP to (2, 3) depending on S1's movements and path security, but generally right and up towards the central cluster.\n\nRIGHT",

S1 did not eat an apple (or if it did, the information is not provided for this turn block). Assuming it didn't eat an apple, its tail (7, 7) will be freed up.\n\n**1.

Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 1):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move RIGHT (3, 1):** Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Apple Proximity and Pathing**\n\nApples: (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 7), (8, 2), (8, 9).\nMy head is at (2, 1). I want to move toward the center (5, 4 or 4, 6).\n\n*   A1 (5, 4): Manhattan distance M=6 ((5-2) + (4-1)).\n*   A2 (4, 6): M=7.\n*   A4 (8, 2): M=7.\n\nThe primary goal is (5, 4). This requires increasing X and Y.\n\nEvaluating safe moves:\n\n*   **UP (2, 2):** Increases Y, keeps X low. Good for pathing toward (4, 6) or transitioning toward (5, 4).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1):** Increases X, keeps Y low. Good for pathing toward (8, 2) or (5, 4).\n*   **DOWN (2, 0):** Moves away from all apples. Avoid unless necessary.\n\nLet's compare UP and RIGHT moving towards (5, 4).\n\n*   **Path via UP (2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4). (5 steps remaining after this move).\n*   **Path via RIGHT (3, 1):**\n    *   (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4). (5 steps remaining after this move).\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient in terms of distance. However, the path UP to (2, 2) immediately raises my Y coordinate, allowing me to bypass the lower section of the board quickly. The body segments currently occupy (1, 1), (0, 1), and then (0, 2), (0, 3). Moving UP to (2, 2) gives me better clearance from my own body segments to the left (1, 1), (0, 1). If I go RIGHT to (3, 1), I stay low and potentially restrict future movement if I need to dip down later.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 2) is a standard progression towards the central part of the board.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (8, 1))**\n\nS1 is at (8, 1). Its closest apples are (8, 2) (M=1) and (5, 4) (M=6).\nS1 Safe Moves from (8, 1):\n*   UP (8, 2): EATS APPLE (8, 2)!\n*   DOWN (8, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (7, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 1): Into its own body (neck). DEATH.\n\nS1 is highly likely to move UP to (8, 2) and score an apple. This is excellent for me, as (8, 2) was a target apple for me but now it will be consumed, focusing my primary objective solely on (5, 4) or (4, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (8, 2):\n*   S1 Head moves to (8, 2).\n*   S1 increases length to 12. S1 tail (7, 7) remains.\n*   Collision check: I am at (2, 1). S1 is at (8, 1). No collision risk.\n\n**4. Final Move Selection**\n\nMoving UP to (2, 2) is the most logical choice:\n1. It moves toward the remaining closest apples, (5, 4) and (4, 6).\n2. It maximizes future flexibility compared to staying at low Y coordinates.\n3. It keeps me far away from the enemy.\n\n**5. Long Term Plan (T=43 onwards):**\nIf I move UP to (2, 2):\nT=43: Head at (2, 2). Target (5, 4). Likely move RIGHT to (3, 2).\nT=44: Head at (3, 2). Move RIGHT to (4, 2) or UP to (3, 3) depending on visibility and necessity to avoid S1 (if S1 turns inward). S1 is likely at (8, 2) and will probably continue exploring the right side or move toward (6, 7).\n\nUP",

Tail (3, 7) was freed. The last segment was (2, 7). No, my rationale for the previous move was wrong about the tail movement.\n\nLet's re-examine the previous move:\nT=42: Head was (2, 1). Body was [(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]. Tail was (3, 7).\nI moved UP to (2, 2).

This list has 11 segments, so the total length is 12. The tail segment is (2, 7).\nSince I did not eat an apple, my tail (2, 7) will be freed up this turn (T=43).\n\nEnemy S1: Head was (8, 1). Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. S1 Length 11.\nS1 moved UP to (8, 2). The apple list for T=42 included (8, 2). S1 ate the apple (8, 2) and grew.\nS1 New Head: (8, 2). New Body: [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. The tail (7, 7) remains occupied. S1 Length 12.\nThe current turn list confirms S1 length is 11 segments + head, total 12. The tail is (7, 7). Since S1 ate an apple, (7, 7) remains occupied.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (2, 2))**\n\n*   **Move UP (2, 3):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (2, 1):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 2):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (3, 2):** Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2.

I need to increase both X and Y.\n\nEvaluating safe moves toward (5, 4):\n\n*   **Move UP (2, 3):** Reduces Y distance from 2 to 1. Maintains X distance 3. New M=4.\n*   **Move RIGHT (3, 2):** Reduces X distance from 3 to 2. Maintains Y distance 2. New M=4.\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 2):** Increases X distance from 3 to 4. Maintains Y distance 2. New M=6. (Moving away from target).\n\nBoth UP (2, 3) and RIGHT (3, 2) are good moves toward (5, 4).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (8, 2))**\n\nS1 is at (8, 2), having just consumed an apple and grown. S1's goal will likely shift towards (6, 7) (M=5 from (8, 2)) or (8, 9) (M=7).\n\n*   S1 Safe Moves from (8, 2):\n    *   UP (8, 3): Safe. Good path toward (8, 9).\n    *   DOWN (8, 1): Into its own body (neck). **DEATH.**\n    *   LEFT (7, 2): Safe. Good path toward (6, 7).\n    *   RIGHT (9, 2): Into its own body (neck). **DEATH.**\n\nS1 is restricted to UP (8, 3) or LEFT (7, 2). S1 is likely to go LEFT toward (6, 7) to block me, or UP if aiming for (8, 9) or (5, 9). Due to the board density, moving LEFT to (7, 2) seems plausible to secure a central apple.\n\n**4. Collision Check and Trapping**\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 2) and S1 goes LEFT to (7, 2), we are still far apart.\nIf I go UP to (2, 3), I keep moving toward the side of my existing body (0, 3), (1, 3).\n\nThe area around (3, 2) and (4, 2) is currently clear. Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) puts me on a fast track to (5, 4) by crossing the bottom half of the map.\n(3, 2) -> (4, 2) (T=44) -> (5, 2) (T=45) -> (5, 3) (T=46) -> (5, 4) (T=47). Total 4 moves.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 3):\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3) (T=44) -> (4, 3) (T=45) -> (5, 3) (T=46) -> (5, 4) (T=47). Total 4 moves.\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient distance-wise (4 steps).\n\nLet's look at relative position to my body.\nMy current body segments are dense on the left side: (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 2), I hug the clear space above coordinates (3, 1) and (4, 1). This area is completely unpopulated.\nIf I move UP to (2, 3), I move adjacent to (1, 3) and (0, 3) and (1, 4). While my tail (2, 7) is clearing, the density of my own body parts immediately to the left and up makes the UP move slightly more complex pathing-wise in the future, as I will have to navigate around the cluster of (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4). It is safer to move into the open lower part of the board now and turn UP later.\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to (3, 2). This keeps me in a wide-open area and directly maintains forward momentum toward (5, 4).\n\n**5. Long Term Plan (T=44 onwards):**\nHead at (3, 2). Target (5, 4).\nT=44: Move RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=45: Move RIGHT to (5, 2). Apple (5, 4) is now M=2 away.\nT=46: Move UP to (5, 3).\nT=47: Move UP to (5, 4) and eat the apple.\n\nThis four-turn aggressive path minimizes the chance of S1 intercepting me, as S1 is far to the right. S1 will likely be trying to secure (6, 7) or (8, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

S1 is currently at (7, 2). This means S1 moved, and I moved.\n\n**Reviewing T=43 moves (from the current state):**\n\nMy previous head was at (2, 2). I moved RIGHT to (3, 2). I did not eat an apple.

(Note: The board state shows (8, 7) marked T, but the body list ends at (8, 7). Let's assume the body list is correct and the board state drawing is slightly delayed or includes the tail that is *about* to move.)\nThe body list for S1 provided is: Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. This list has 10 segments. Total length 11.\n\nFor this turn (T=44), the coordinates (2, 6) (my old tail) and (8, 7) (S1's old tail) are safe to move into.\n\nApples: (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9)\nMy current head: (3, 2).\n\n**1.

Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 2):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 2):** Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Apple Proximity and Pathing**\n\nTarget Apple: (5, 4) (M=3 from (3, 2)).\n*   A1 (5, 4): X diff 2, Y diff 2. M=4. Wait, M = |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nEvaluating safe moves toward (5, 4):\n*   **Move UP (3, 3):** X diff 2, Y diff 1. M=3. (Closer)\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 1):** X diff 2, Y diff 3. M=5. (Further)\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 2):** X diff 1, Y diff 2. M=3. (Closer)\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are good moves toward (5, 4).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (7, 2))**\n\nS1 is at (7, 2).\nS1 targets: (6, 7) (M=1+5=6), (5, 4) (M=2+2=4). S1 is closer to (5, 4) than (6, 7). However, S1 might prefer (6, 7) to block my long winding body on the left side, or (8, 9) (M=1+7=8). S1 moved left last turn, suggesting intent to move toward the center/left.\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (7, 2):\n*   UP (7, 3): Safe. (M=5 to (5, 4))\n*   DOWN (7, 1): Safe. (M=5 to (5, 4))\n*   LEFT (6, 2): Safe. (M=3 to (5, 4))\n*   RIGHT (8, 2): Into its body (neck). **DEATH.**\n\nS1 is likely to move LEFT to (6, 2) to claim (5, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 7) (which is free this turn, (8, 7) is on the 7th row, but that's not a direct apple route). S1 will prioritize LEFT (6, 2) since it's the fastest way to the closest apple (5, 4).\n\nIf S1 moves to (6, 2):\nT=44 S1: (6, 2). M=3 to (5, 4).\n\n**4. Collision and Competition Analysis**\n\nMy plan from the previous turn was:\nT=44: Move RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=45: Move RIGHT to (5, 2).\nT=46: Move UP to (5, 3).\nT=47: Move UP to (5, 4) (Eat).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 2): M=3 to (5, 4).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (6, 2): M=3 to (5, 4).\n\nWe are racing for (5, 4).\nIf I choose (4, 2), S1 chooses (6, 2). At T=45:\nMy Head: (5, 2) (M=2)\nS1 Head: (5, 2) (M=2)\nIf we both target (5, 2) at T=45, we collide HEAD-ON and both die. This is highly probable if we both race for (5, 4) optimally.\n\nI must change my plan to avoid the collision square (5, 2) while maintaining the apple focus.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 3): (M=3 to (5, 4))\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (6, 2): (M=3 to (5, 4))\n\nT=45:\nFrom (3, 3): I can move RIGHT to (4, 3) (M=2), or UP to (3, 4) (M=3), or DOWN to (3, 2). I'd move to (4, 3).\nFrom (6, 2): S1 can move LEFT to (5, 2) (M=2), or UP to (6, 3) (M=3). S1 would move to (5, 2).\n\nIf this happens:\nT=45: I am at (4, 3). S1 is at (5, 2). No collision yet.\n\nT=46:\nMy head (4, 3). To (5, 4). I prefer UP to (4, 4) (M=2) or RIGHT to (5, 3) (M=1). I choose (5, 3).\nS1 head (5, 2). To (5, 4). S1 prefers UP to (5, 3) (M=1).\n\nIf I move (5, 3) and S1 moves (5, 3) at T=46, we collide HEAD-ON and both die.\n\nIt seems going for (5, 4) guarantees a head-on collision or a very close confrontation that results in a block. I should pivot to a different apple that S1 is less likely to race me for, or find a route that leads to a guaranteed win of (5, 4) or a position of strength.\n\nLet's look at the next closest apple: (4, 6) (M=2+4=6 from (3, 2)).\n\nIf I pivot UP to (3, 3), I am also aiming for (4, 6).\n(3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) (Eat). 4 moves.\n\nS1 at (7, 2). If S1 goes LEFT to (6, 2), and continues up:\n(6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7). 5 moves to (6, 7).\nS1 to (4, 6): M = |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7. Seems S1 won't prioritize (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, abandoning (5, 4) for (4, 6) seems like a safer, if slightly longer, strategy (4 moves vs 4 moves to (5, 4) if it were safe).\n\nPath to (4, 6):\nT=44: Move UP (3, 3). M=5.\nT=45: Move RIGHT (4, 3). M=4.\nT=46: Move UP (4, 4). M=2.\nT=47: Move UP (4, 5). M=1.\nT=48: Move UP (4, 6). Eat.\n\nThis path keeps me away from the center X=5 line intersection where S1 will likely be heading. If S1 pursues (5, 4), S1 blocks the central path, but opens up the Y=6 path for me.\n\nLet's verify the safety of UP (3, 3).\n(3, 3) is clear. It is far from S1 movement range this turn.\n\nRationale summary: I am abandoning the collision course for (5, 4). I am shifting UP to focus on (4, 6), which is less likely to be contested by S1, who appears headed toward the central right side (5, 4) or (6, 7). Moving UP (3, 3) is the start of an optimal pursuit path for (4, 6).\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=44 onwards):**\nHead at (3, 2). Target (4, 6).\nT=44: Move UP to (3, 3).\nT=45: Move RIGHT to (4, 3).\nT=46: Move UP to (4, 4).\nT=47: Move UP to (4, 5).\nT=48: Move UP to (4, 6) and eat the apple.\n\nIf S1 pivots unexpectedly: I will reassess. But for T=44, UP is the best move opening up the next best apple while mitigating immediate risks.\n\nUP",

M to (5, 4) is 2.\nS1 anticipated at (5, 2). M to (5, 4) is 2.\n\nT=46:\nMy options from (3, 4) to (5, 4):\n*   RIGHT to (4, 4). M=1.\n*   RIGHT, UP to (5, 4). M=1. (Dangerous, but slightly longer distance, so likely safer).\n*   Let's check (4, 4). From (4, 4), I can move RIGHT to (5, 4) and eat at T=47. Total 3 moves.\n\nS1's options from (5, 2) to (5, 4):\n*   UP to (5, 3). M=1.\n*   UP to (5, 4) and eat at T=47. Total 2 moves. (S1 would optimize and go for (5, 3) at T=46, then (5, 4) at T=47 OR S1 could move (5, 4) at T=46 if T=45 move was (5, 3), but it wasn't).\n\nWait, I miscalculated S1 speed.\nS1 Head (6, 2). Moves to (5, 2) at T=45. M=2 to (5, 4). S1 can reach (5, 4) at T=47.\n(6, 2) -> (5, 2) (T=45) -> (5, 3) (T=46) -> (5, 4) (T=47, Eat).\n\nMy snake Head (3, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT (4, 3). M=2 to (5, 4). I can reach (5, 4) at T=46 via (5, 3)!\n(3, 3) -> (4, 3) (T=45, M=2) -> (5, 3) (T=46, M=1) -> (5, 4) (T=47, Eat). Oh, still T=47. Wait, M=2 means 2 steps remaining.\n(4, 3) to (5, 4):\nMove 1: (5, 3). Remaining M=1.\nMove 2: (5, 4). Eat.\nI reach (5, 4) at T=47. Same as S1. This confirms the collision risk at (5, 3) at T=46.\n\nIf I move UP (3, 4). M=2 to (5, 4). I can reach (5, 4) at T=47.\n(3, 3) -> (3, 4) (T=45, M=2) -> (4, 4) (T=46, M=1) -> (5, 4) (T=47, Eat).\n\nIf S1 is going for (5, 4), S1 will travel through (5, 3).\nIf I travel through (5, 3), collision.\n\nIf I move UP (3, 4), and then RIGHT (4, 4), and then RIGHT (5, 4):\nS1: (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4).\nMe: (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4).\n\nIf we both move this way, we both arrive at (5, 4) at T=47. HEAD-ON COLLISION at (5, 4)!\n\nThis confirms that I absolutely must NOT race S1 for (5, 4).\n\n**Reverting to Apple (4, 6)**\n\nTarget (4, 6). M=4 from (3, 3). Reachable at T=49. Wait, 4 moves means T=45 + 4 = T=49.\n\nPath to (4, 6) from (3, 3):\nT=45: RIGHT (4, 3). M=3.\nT=46: UP (4, 4). M=2.\nT=47: UP (4, 5). M=1.\nT=48: UP (4, 6). Eat. Total 3 moves.\n\nLet's recalculate the path length:\n(3, 3) -> (4, 3) [1] -> (4, 4) [2] -> (4, 5) [3] -> (4, 6) [4].\nT=45 (Move 1): (4, 3)\nT=46 (Move 2): (4, 4)\nT=47 (Move 3): (4, 5)\nT=48 (Move 4): (4, 6) (EAT). Correct.\n\nS1 Path to (4, 6): M = |4-6| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6. S1 will not race me.\n\nSo, moving RIGHT to (4, 3) is safe and sets up the sequence for (4, 6).\n\n**Feasibility Check: RIGHT (4, 3)**\n(4, 3) is clear of my body and S1's head/body.\nIf S1 moves (5, 2), (4, 3) is safe.\n\n**Alternative T=45 move: UP (3, 4)**\nIf I move UP (3, 4). M to (4, 6) is 5.\n(3, 4) -> (4, 4) [1] -> (4, 5) [2] -> (4, 6) [3]. 3 moves from (3, 4). T=48.\nThis is identical in time to T=45: RIGHT (4, 3) and subsequent moves.\n\nWhy prefer RIGHT (4, 3) over UP (3, 4)?\n1. Spatial control: (4, 3) keeps me closer to the center line (X=4) where my goal (4, 6) resides, and also leaves (3, 4) as an escape route if needed, although I am heading up.\n2. If S1 decides to block me towards the center left, having moved right already puts me in a better position.\n\nGiven that both RIGHT and UP offer a safe path to (4, 6) in 3 total moves (reaching it at T=48), I choose RIGHT to maintain the X=4 column alignment immediately.\n\nLong Term Plan (T=45 onwards):\nHead at (3, 3). Target (4, 6).\nT=45: Move RIGHT to (4, 3).\nT=46: Move UP to (4, 4).\nT=47: Move UP to (4, 5).\nT=48: Move UP to (4, 6) and eat the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

S1 can reach (5, 4) in 2 moves (T=48).\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (5, 2):\n*   UP (5, 3): Direct path towards (5, 4). Optimal.\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Empty cell.\n*   LEFT (4, 2): Empty cell.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Into its body (neck). **DEATH.**\n\nWe strongly predict S1 moves UP to (5, 3) to approach apple (5, 4).\n\n**3. Collision Check**\n\nMy safe moves are (4, 4), (4, 2), and (5, 3).\n\n*   **If I move UP (4, 4):** No collision with anticipated S1 head (5, 3). Safe.\n*   **If I move DOWN (4, 2):** S1 moves to (5, 3). No collision. Safe.\n*   **If I move RIGHT (5, 3):** S1 is anticipated to move UP to (5, 3). **HEAD-ON COLLISION.

M to (4, 6) from (4, 2) is 4.\n    If I move DOWN, I might look for protection or another apple.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMoving UP to (4, 4) maintains my strategy to acquire apple (4, 6) safely and quickly (T=48), while completely avoiding the high-risk collision area at (5, 3) where S1 is almost certainly heading for (5, 4).\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=46 onwards):**\nHead at (4, 3).

Let's re-evaluate S1's last move.)\n\nS1 (T=46) Head: (5, 2). S1 moved DOWN from (5, 2) to (5, 1). This is a very surprising move, as (5, 4) was only 2 moves away from (5, 2). Moving to (5, 1) has increased its distance to (5, 4) to M=4.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (4, 4))**\n\nOccupied cells:\nMy body (excluding tail (1, 4)): (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3)\nS1 body (excluding tail (9, 5)): (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)\n\nPotential moves:\n*   **Move UP (4, 5):** Empty cell. Safe. (Continues towards (4, 6))\n*   **Move DOWN (4, 3):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move LEFT (3, 4):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (5, 4):** This is an apple! Potential EAT.\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 5), LEFT (3, 4), RIGHT (5, 4).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (5, 1))**\n\nS1 is at (5, 1).\nS1 Targets: (5, 4) (M=3), (6, 7) (M=7), (5, 9) (M=8). (5, 4) is clearly the best target.\n\nS1 Safe Moves from (5, 1):\n*   UP (5, 2): Into its body (neck). **DEATH.** (Wait, the body segments are (5, 2), (6, 2), ...). Moving UP to (5, 2) is into its neck. **DEATH.**\n*   DOWN (5, 0): Empty cell. Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 1): Empty cell. Safe.\n*   RIGHT (6, 1): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nS1 cannot move UP to (5, 2) because (5, 2) is its neck segment. S1 is now in a precarious position, locked below its own body segments (5, 2). It must move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, which takes it further away from (5, 4).\n\nGiven S1's bizarre move, it seems S1 is either trying to set up a trap or is poorly controlled. If S1 wants to go to (5, 4), it must now backtrack around its tail or move through the bottom edge.\n\nPrediction for S1:\n1.  Move RIGHT (6, 1): Closer to the open area to move up the right side.\n2.  Move LEFT (4, 1): Opens up the middle pathway.\n3.  Move DOWN (5, 0): Moves to the wall.\n\nSince S1 moved DOWN intentionally last turn, perhaps it is looking to hug the bottom wall. I will assume S1 moves to (5, 0) or (6, 1). Neither move threatens my current position at (4, 4) or my move to (5, 4).\n\n**3. Evaluate Move Choices for Snake 0**\n\nI have three safe moves: UP (4, 5), LEFT (3, 4), RIGHT (5, 4 - Apple).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (5, 4): EAT APPLE.**\n    This is the best strategic option. It gains 1 point, adds 1 length, and denies S1 its nearest target.\n    Collision check: S1 is at (5, 1). If S1 moves (5, 0), (4, 1), or (6, 1), there is no collision at (5, 4). This move is completely safe.\n\n*   **Move UP (4, 5):** Move toward (4, 6). Good, but passing up a closer, safer apple to go to a slightly farther apple is usually suboptimal unless there is a pressing reason (like a collision threat at (5, 4)). There is no collision threat at (5, 4).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (3, 4):** Moves away from all near apples. Bad.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe immediate move is to consume the apple at (5, 4). This is safe, rewarding, and hurts S1's strategy (S1 was positioned for (5, 4) until its self-defeating move to (5, 1)).\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=48 onwards):**\nMy new head will be at (5, 4).\nApples remaining: (4, 6), (6, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9).\nTarget (4, 6) is M=2 away.\nTarget (6, 7) is M=3 away.\n\nT=47 (Current): Move RIGHT to (5, 4) and EAT.\nT=48: Move UP to (5, 5) or LEFT to (4, 4) to position for (4, 6). Since (4, 4) is now part of my body, I should move UP to (5, 5) or perhaps LEFT/UP toward (4, 6). (5, 5) is M=3 to (6, 7) and M=3 to (4, 6). A move to (5, 5) is central and safe.\n\nStrategy: Eat (5, 4) now. Then pursue (4, 6) or (6, 7), depending on S1's repositioning. Given S1 is now trapped low, I should prioritize the cluster of apples (4, 6) and (6, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

Distance to (4, 6) is M=2.\n*   Move RIGHT to (6, 4). Distance to (4, 6) is M=3.\n*   Move DOWN to (5, 3). Distance to (4, 6) is M=4.\n\nTarget (6, 7):\n*   Move UP to (5, 5).

S1 can only move DOWN to (3, 0) safely, or S1 dies. I assume S1 makes the only safe move.\n\nPrediction for S1: S1 moves DOWN to (3, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Collision Threats**\n\nMy snake is high (Y=5). S1 is low (Y=1, moving to Y=0). No collision threat.\n\n**4. Evaluate Snake 0's Strategy (Head: (5, 5))**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to grab the apple cluster above.\nApples:\n*   (4, 6): M=2\n*   (6, 7): M=3\n*   (6, 8): M=4\n*   (5, 9): M=4\n\nWe want to get to (4, 6) or (6, 7).\n\nA.

Move LEFT to (4, 5):\n*   To (4, 6): M=1 (UP)\n*   To (6, 7): M=3 (RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP)\n*   This commits us heavily to the Y=6 level (apple at 4, 6).\n\nC. Move RIGHT to (6, 5):\n*   To (4, 6): M=3 (LEFT, LEFT, UP)\n*   To (6, 7): M=2 (UP, UP)\n*   This commits us heavily towards the Y=7/Y=8 levels (apples at 6, 7 and 6, 8).\n\nMoving UP to (5, 6) seems the most flexible, as it puts us exactly one step away from the coordinate 6, either (4, 6) or (6, 6) (which is M=1 from (6, 7)).\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6):\nNext turn, I can move LEFT to (4, 6) and eat the apple. This is excellent.\nIf I move UP, I prevent S1 from ever reaching (5, 6) or (5, 7) quickly, though S1 is already trapped. For now, prioritizing the shortest path to an apple is best.\n\nThe shortest Manhattan distance is to (4, 6) (M=2 via LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT).\nIf I go UP to (5, 6), the next turn I go LEFT to (4, 6) and eat. This feels secure and clean.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMove UP to (5, 6).\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=50 onwards):**\nIf I move UP to (5, 6): Next turn, move LEFT to (4, 6) and eat the apple. After eating (4, 6), aim for (6, 7) or (6, 8). S1 should remain bottled up down near Y=0.\n\nUP",

S1's priority will be survival and potentially getting out of the corner if possible, or blocking my tail if I move down. Given my position is high up, S1 is unlikely to interfere.\n\nAssume S1 moves RIGHT (4, 0) to try and move along the bottom edge towards the right side of the board.\n\n**3.

My old head position, which became a body segment because I ate the apple. **DEATH.**\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0: UP (4, 7), DOWN (4, 5), LEFT (3, 6).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (4, 0))**\n\nS1 is at (4, 0). S1 is still low down and currently focused on survival or maybe the single apple at (1, 0).\nPossible moves for S1:\n*   UP (4, 1): Into S1 body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   DOWN (4, -1): Wall. **DEATH.**\n*   LEFT (3, 0): Into S1 body (neck, from assumption T=50 move). Wait, let's re-examine body list.\n    S1 Body: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 1)].\n    Head (4, 0) moved from (3, 0) in T=50.\n    Thus, (3, 0) is now the neck/S1 body.\n    Move LEFT (3, 0): Into S1 body. **DEATH.**\n*   RIGHT (5, 0): Empty. Safe.\n\nS1's only safe move is RIGHT (5, 0). If S1 fails to move RIGHT, it dies. Given the constraints, S1 *will* move RIGHT to (5, 0). S1 is moving towards the right side of the board, distance 6 from the closest apple (1, 0). S1 is not a threat to my immediate objectives or collision path.\n\n**3. Evaluate Optimal Move for Snake 0**\n\nMy objective is to pursue the cluster of apples around (6, 7), (6, 8), and (5, 9).\n\nA) Move UP to (4, 7):\n*   Closer to the cluster.\n*   M to (6, 7) is 2 (RIGHT, UP).\n*   M to (6, 8) is 3.\n*   M to (5, 9) is 3 (UP, UP, RIGHT or 4,7 -> 5,7 then up up).\n\nB) Move DOWN to (4, 5):\n*   Moves away from the apple cluster. Bad.\n\nC) Move LEFT to (3, 6):\n*   Moves away from the apple cluster. Bad.\n\nMoving UP to (4, 7) keeps me high up and positions me well to move towards the center-right high apples. (6, 7) seems like the next best target.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 7):\nT=52 possibilities from (4, 7):\n1. UP (4, 8): Safe. M=2 to (5, 9) (RIGHT, UP). M=3 to (6, 7).\n2. DOWN (4, 6): Safe. (Tail segment (4, 6) is vacated by my head if I don't eat). Hitting the vacated head position is not a suicide move if the snake didn't eat.\n3. LEFT (3, 7): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (5, 7): Safe. M=1 to (6, 7) (RIGHT). M=2 to (5, 9). M=2 to (6, 8). This looks ideal.\n\nThe strategy of moving UP to (4, 7) sets up a move RIGHT to (5, 7) or further UP to (4, 8) depending on which apple seems most feasible/profitable.\n\nLet's look at the apple density around (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 9). This area is fairly open. I am currently in a dominant position in the top half of the board.\n\nChoosing UP (4, 7) maintains forward momentum and excellent positioning.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nMove UP.\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=52 onwards):**\nIf I move UP to (4, 7). Next target is (6, 7), (6, 8), or (5, 9).\nT=52 Plan: Move RIGHT to (5, 7). This positions me directly below (5, 8) and adjacent to (6, 7). From (5, 7) I can target (6, 7) (RIGHT), (5, 9) (UP, UP). Alternatively, move UP to (4, 8) to target (5, 9) and (8, 9). I will re-evaluate at T=52, but leaning towards moving towards (5, 7) or (4, 8) to secure the cluster.\n\nUP",

S1 moving UP is generally safer for S1 as it avoids the dense snake body configuration in the bottom right corner. If S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 0), it still has a long way to go for (1, 0).\n\nRegardless of S1's move, S1 is too far away (M=7 to (6, 7)) to contest (6, 7) this turn.\n\n**5.

Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 7):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 8):** Empty. Targeting (5, 9) apple. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0: UP (6, 9), LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8).\n\n**3. Evaluate Optimal Move for Snake 0**\n\nI am at (6, 8). I have two nearby apples: (5, 9) and (8, 9).\n\n*   (5, 9) is 1 move away via LEFT then UP (or UP then LEFT, both M=2).\n*   (8, 9) is 1 move away via RIGHT then UP (or UP then RIGHT, both M=3).\n\nLet's evaluate the available moves:\n\n*   **Move UP (6, 9):** Moves to the edge of the board. From (6, 9), I can move LEFT to (5, 9) (apple) or RIGHT to (7, 9) (empty). This is a strong move towards securing (5, 9) and (8, 9).\n    *   *Path to (5, 9):* (6, 8) -> UP (6, 9) -> LEFT (5, 9) [Apple]. Total 2 turns.\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 8):** Moves directly towards the (5, 9) apple. From (5, 8), I can move UP to (5, 9) (apple).\n    *   *Path to (5, 9):* (6, 8) -> LEFT (5, 8) -> UP (5, 9) [Apple]. Total 2 turns.\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 8):** Moves towards the (8, 9) apple. From (7, 8), I can move UP to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8). (8, 9) would be attained in 3 turns: (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 9).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT put me in position to eat (5, 9) next turn. However, LEFT seems slightly more direct and keeps the option open to cut back to the middle of the board if S1 moves up.\n\nLet's check for proximity to S1.\nS1 is at (7, 1). It is currently far away. Its closest apple is (6, 1). S1 is likely moving LEFT to (6, 1) next turn.\n\n**4. Analyzing Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (7, 1))**\n\nS1 is at (7, 1). Appreciable apples: (6, 1) [M=1, IMMEDIATE], (1, 0) [M=6].\nPossible moves for S1 from (7, 1):\n*   UP (7, 2): Empty. Safe.\n*   DOWN (7, 0): Into S1 body (neck). **DEATH.** Wait, (7, 0) is S1 body, not neck. S1 body starts at (7, 0). (7, 0) is the segment just *behind* the head. This is a move directly backwards and is **DEATH**.\n*   LEFT (6, 1): Apple! This is a winning maneuver for S1. S1 will certainly take this. Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 1): Empty. Safe.\n\nS1 will move LEFT to (6, 1). This is unavoidable. When S1 moves LEFT, it will eat the apple (6, 1) and grow.\nT=56 S1 Head: (6, 1). Tail remains at (6, 2).\n\n**5. Choosing between UP and LEFT for Snake 0**\n\nBoth UP and LEFT lead to (5, 9) in T=57.\n\n*   If I move UP to (6, 9), I maximize my options along the top wall.\n    *   T=56: (6, 9). Next moves: LEFT (5, 9, apple), RIGHT (7, 9), DOWN (6, 8, my body).\n*   If I move LEFT to (5, 8), I focus on the apple.\n    *   T=56: (5, 8). Next moves: UP (5, 9, apple), RIGHT (6, 8, my body), DOWN (5, 7, my body), LEFT (4, 8).\n\n(6, 9) gives me two options for non-body moves (LEFT, RIGHT).\n(5, 8) gives me two options for non-body moves (UP, LEFT).\n\nSince (5, 9) is the closest high-value target, moving LEFT to (5, 8) provides the most direct route in terms of minimizing Manhattan distance and positioning myself closer to the next apple. It also keeps my body structure more cohesive near the center-right of the board, which is currently beneficial.\n\nLet's confirm no collision risk:\nI am at (6, 8). S1 is at (7, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 8). S1 moves LEFT to (6, 1). No collision risk.\n\nMove LEFT is optimal for immediate apple acquisition.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Note**\nT=56: Move LEFT to (5, 8).\nT=57: Move UP to (5, 9), eating the apple.\nT=58: Target the remaining high-positioned apple at (8, 9). I will be at (5, 9). Route: RIGHT (6, 9), RIGHT (7, 9), RIGHT (8, 9). (3 turns).\nS1 will be at (6, 1) and will likely target (1, 0), or maybe try to move along the bottom towards the center. I should keep pushing for the upper territory before S1 can loop back up.\n\nLEFT",

(Note: The board shows (5, 2) is a body segment 'T', adjacent to (6, 2) which is S1's head '1'. If S1's body list is correct `[(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)]`, then (5, 2) is the current tail *if S1 ate last turn*. Let's re-verify S1's move from Turn 56 based on the provided state data.)\n\n**Revisiting Turn 56 Outcome based on Turn 57 Input:**\n\nInput for Turn 57 shows:\nYour Snake Head: (5, 9). Body length 16 -> 17. Tail is (1, 1). (You ate the apple at (5, 9)).\nS1 Head: (6, 2). Body list: `[(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)]`. Length 12.\nWait, the provided body list for S1 is 11 segments long. With the head (6, 2), S1 length is 12.\nThe previous turn S1 head was (6, 1). The current head is (6, 2). S1 must have moved UP from (6, 1) to (6, 2).\nDid S1 eat an apple at (6, 2)? The board state for Turn 56 did not list (6, 2) as an apple.\nIf S1 moved UP and did not eat, the tail (6, 2) from Turn 56 (which was the end of the previous body list: `[(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2)]`) should have been vacated. If S1 did not eat, the new tail is (5, 2).\nS1's move was UP: (6, 1) -> (6, 2). S1 did not eat, based on apple count remaining 11.\nTherefore: S1's body is now: Eaten (6, 1) -> Head (6, 2), Body `[(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]`. The tail (5, 2) should have been vacated *if* S1 had not eaten on M=55.\nThe board state diagram shows 'T' at (5, 2). Let's trust the provided body list structure, which implies (5, 2) is the tail: (5, 2) is the last element in the body list `... (5, 1), (5, 2)]`.\nSince S1 did not eat on Turn 56 (apples collected remains 11), S1's tail (5, 2) *will be vacated* this turn (T=57).\n\n**Summary of Occupation for T=58 Lookahead (T=57 is the move we are picking):**\n\nApples collected: 16 (You just ate (5, 9)). Your body grew. Tail remains at (1, 1). (It will be vacated IF you don't eat this turn).\n\nApples at: (8, 9), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (7, 4)\n\nYour Snake (ID 0) Head: (5, 9). You grew, so your tail (1, 1) is occupied for T=57 and T=58. The body list provided for (T=57) already incorporates the growth: `[(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)]`.\n\nS1 Head: (6, 2). S1 body: `[(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)]`. S1 did NOT eat last turn, so the tail (5, 2) **will be vacated** this turn.\n\n**Occupied cells for T=58 (Static obstacles for my head (5, 9)):**\n*   My body (minus the current tail (1, 1) because I ate T=56): (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1).

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (5, 9))**\n\n*   **Move UP (5, 10):** Off board (Y=10). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move DOWN (5, 8):** Into my body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move LEFT (4, 9):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (6, 9):** Empty. Safe. Targetting (8, 9).\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0: LEFT (4, 9), RIGHT (6, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Optimal Move for Snake 0**\n\nThe closest apple is (8, 9), 3 manhattan distance away.\n(5, 9) $\\to$ RIGHT (6, 9) $\\to$ RIGHT (7, 9) $\\to$ RIGHT (8, 9). I can reach it in 3 turns if the path is clear.\n\nIf I move LEFT (4, 9), I move away from (8, 9) (distance 5) and closer to the cluster (1, 6), (2, 6) (distance 5/6). This is currently less attractive than (8, 9).\n\nI should prioritize moving toward (8, 9) unless a safety conflict emerges.\n\n**3. Analyzing Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (6, 2))**\n\nS1 is at (6, 2). Possible moves:\n*   UP (6, 3): Empty. Safe.\n*   DOWN (6, 1): Into S1 body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   LEFT (5, 2): S1 tail! Safe (since S1 did not eat T=56).\n*   RIGHT (7, 2): Empty. Safe.\n\nS1 has UP (6, 3), LEFT (5, 2), RIGHT (7, 2) available.\n\nS1's closest apple is (7, 4) (M=3).\n(6, 2) $\\to$ UP (6, 3) $\\to$ UP (6, 4) $\\to$ RIGHT/LEFT (7, 4) or (5, 4)? No, S1 is closer via (7, 3) or (6, 3) path.\n(6, 2) $\\to$ UP (6, 3) $\\to$ RIGHT (7, 3) $\\to$ UP (7, 4). (3 turns)\n(6, 2) $\\to$ RIGHT (7, 2) $\\to$ UP (7, 3) $\\to$ UP (7, 4). (3 turns)\n\nS1 is clearly targeting (7, 4). The path (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) is very likely given the layout.\n\n**4. Collision Check (T=58)**\n\nMy move: RIGHT (6, 9).\nS1 likely moves: UP (6, 3), RIGHT (7, 2), or LEFT (5, 2).\n\n(6, 9) is far from S1's potential moves. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**5. Optimal Move Selection**\n\nMoving RIGHT towards (8, 9) is the fastest way to the next apple and keeps me away from S1.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy**\nT=57: RIGHT (6, 9). Target (8, 9).\nT=58: RIGHT (7, 9).\nT=59: RIGHT (8, 9). (Eat apple).\n\nS1 is likely going for (7, 4). We are currently in a good position to outscore S1.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nT=57: Move RIGHT to (6, 9) to continue targeting the apple at (8, 9). This keeps me high and safe from S1, who appears to be targeting (7, 4).\nT=58: Move RIGHT to (7, 9).\nT=59: Move RIGHT to (8, 9) and collect the apple.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (8, 9))**\n\n*   My occupied cells (Length 18, Tail at (2, 2), if I don't eat, (3, 2) is vacated):\n    [(8, 9 - Head), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2)]. (Excluding tail (2, 2)).\n\n*   S1 occupied cells (Length 13, Tail at (4, 1), if S1 doesn't eat, (4, 1) is vacated):\n    S1 Body T=59: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)].\n    S1 Head T=60: (7, 4).\n    S1 Body T=60 (excluding tail, assuming S1 ate): [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)]. (Length 12 segments behind head).\n    S1 occupied: (7, 4) (Head), [(7, 3)...(4, 1)].\n\nLet's check moves from (8, 9):\n*   **Move UP (8, 10):** Off board (Y=10). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move DOWN (8, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 9):** Into my body. **DEATH.**\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 9):** Empty. Safe.\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN (8, 8) and RIGHT (9, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Goals and Path Planning**\n\nMy current position is (8, 9), high up.\nApples available: (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (9, 5), (2, 4).\n\nThe cluster (1, 6) and (2, 6) is appealing because it blocks S1 from accessing the top left if I can get there quickly, and S1 is currently in the middle-bottom area. Apple (9, 5) is also close. Apple (2, 4) is also reasonably accessible.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT (9, 9)** (Towards Apple (9, 5))\nFrom (9, 9):\nIf I move RIGHT, I am pinned against the right wall.\nT=61: (9, 8) (DOWN). Safe.\nT=62: (9, 7) (DOWN). Safe.\nT=63: (9, 6) (DOWN). Safe.\nT=64: (9, 5) (DOWN). Apple!\nThis path is quick and deterministic: 4 moves to an apple. This is excellent.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN (8, 8)** (Towards Center/Left Apples)\nFrom (8, 8):\nT=61: (8, 7) (DOWN). Safe.\nT=62: (7, 7) (LEFT). Safe, (7, 7) is empty.\nT=63: (7, 6) (DOWN). Safe.\nT=64: (6, 6) (LEFT). **DANGER:** (6, 6) is currently occupied by S0 body segment if I don't eat this turn. Wait, let's recheck the map.\n\n**My Body Locations (T=60):**\n(8, 9) Head.\n(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9),\n(5, 8), (6, 8),\n(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7),\n(4, 6), (5, 6),\n(5, 5),\n(5, 4), (4, 4),\n(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2) Tail.\n\n(6, 6) is occupied by my body. So paths involving moving into my own dense structure must be avoided unless the movement rate is carefully calculated relative to the tail evacuation. Since my length is 18, the tail (2, 2) is a long way off.\n\nIf I move DOWN (8, 8) and continue towards the center, I encounter my body quickly (e.g., (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6)). This suggests moving RIGHT and down the wall is a safer short-term strategy to grab the guaranteed apple at (9, 5).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1**\n\nS1 Head: (7, 4). S1 is likely at length 13.\nApples S1 might aim for: (2, 4) (M=5 minimum), (1, 6)/(2, 6) (M=7 minimum), (1, 0) (M=4 minimum).\n\nS1 safe moves from (7, 4):\n*   UP (7, 5): Empty. Safe.\n*   DOWN (7, 3): Into S1 body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   LEFT (6, 4): Empty. Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 4): Empty. Safe. (S1 Head is at (7, 4), S1 body is behind it. (7, 3) is safe ONLY if S1 did not eat at T=59, but S1 likely did eat (7, 4)). Let's assume S1 ate (7, 4) and its body follows. (7, 3) is a body segment. So S1 cannot move DOWN.\n\nIf S1 wants (2, 4), S1 should move LEFT (6, 4).\nIf S1 wants (9, 5), S1 should move RIGHT (8, 4) then UP (8, 5) then RIGHT (9, 5). (3 steps).\nIf S1 wants (1, 6)/(2, 6), S1 should move [6, 4] -> [5, 4] -> ... (too long) or [7, 5] -> [6, 5] -> ...\n\nApple (9, 5) is 4 steps away for me (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\nApple (9, 5) is 3 steps away for S1 if S1 moves RIGHT, UP, RIGHT (or 4 steps if S1 moves RIGHT, UP, UP, LEFT/RIGHT).\n(7, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) (3 steps, if target is A).\nIf S1 plays optimally, it will go for (9, 5) which is the closest apple now.\n\n**Wait, (9, 5) is 4 steps for me: (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5). No, that's 5 steps.**\n\nMy calculation for Option A was wrong:\n(8, 9) Head.\nT=60: RIGHT to (9, 9). (1)\nT=61: DOWN to (9, 8). (2)\nT=62: DOWN to (9, 7). (3)\nT=63: DOWN to (9, 6). (4)\nT=64: DOWN to (9, 5). (5) -> Apple. (5 turns).\n\nLet's re-examine S1's path to (9, 5) from (7, 4).\nT=60: RIGHT to (8, 4) (1)\nT=61: UP to (8, 5) (2)\nT=62: RIGHT to (9, 5) (3) -> Apple! (3 turns).\n\nS1 will beat me to (9, 5) by two turns if S1 commits fully. I must abandon that target.\n\n**4. Alternative Targets for Snake 0**\n\nNearest targets are (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), and (1, 0).\n\nLet's look at the (1, 6) / (2, 6) cluster (Top Left).\nPath from (8, 9): I need to move left and down, avoiding my central mass.\n\nT=60: DOWN (8, 8). (Safe)\nT=61: DOWN (8, 7). (Safe)\nT=62: LEFT (7, 7). (Safe)\nT=63: LEFT (6, 7). **DEAD.** (6, 7) is my body.\n\nSo, I must swing wide around my body to the left side/bottom.\n\nPath B revised: Going left, starting with (8, 8), (8, 7).\n(8, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5 - my body T) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4 - my body T)\nThis path is highly congested by my own long body. I need to move to the open space in columns 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's aim for the open column 3, then down.\n(8, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (6, 8 - my body T) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 7 - my body T)\n\nThe most consistent path is to stay on the edge until I can cut across at Row 5 or lower.\n\n**Let's try to get to (0, 7) or (0, 6).**\n(8, 9) -> (8, 8) [D]\n(8, 8) -> (7, 8) [L]\n(7, 8) -> (7, 7) [D]\n(7, 7) -> (6, 7) [L] <- **DEATH**. (6, 7) is my body.\n\nThis means I must drop down towards the board center without immediately moving left, or only moving left in R9-R8 where I have free space.\n\nSafe movements sequence:\nT=60: DOWN (8, 8). Safe.\nT=61: DOWN (8, 7). Safe.\nT=62: LEFT (7, 7). Safe.\nT=63: DOWN (7, 6). Safe.\nT=64: DOWN (7, 5). Safe. (7, 5) is empty.\nT=65: LEFT (6, 5). Safe. (6, 5) is empty.\nT=66: LEFT (5, 5). **DEATH**. (5, 5) is my body.\n\nIf I cannot reach (1, 6) easily without hitting myself, I should look at (2, 4) or (1, 0).\n\n(2, 4) is 4 steps from (7, 5) or 5 steps from (6, 5).\nIf I stop at (7, 5) at T=64, I need: (7, 5) -> (6, 5) [L] -> (5, 5) [L] (DEAD) OR (7, 5) -> (7, 4) [D] (S1 head/body/old tail?).\n\nS1 Head is (7, 4) if S1 moves UP, or (8, 4)/(6, 4) if S1 moves R/L.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4) to grab (9, 5), (7, 4) is empty but likely S1's new tail (4, 1) or its immediate body segment (4, 1) is vacated. S1 length 13. S1 body moves. T=60, (7, 4) becomes S1 body segment. So (7, 4) is blocked.\n\nThe only genuinely safe path is moving DOWN the right edge until I pass my body cluster, then swinging left.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (9, 5). Although S1 is closer (3 steps vs my 5 steps), S1 might not take it.\nS1 has alternative targets: (2, 4) (M=5 from (7, 4)). (1, 0) (M=4 from (7, 4)). Wait, (1, 0) is actually very close to S1.\nS1 at (7, 4):\n(7, 4) -> (7, 3) (Body, DEAD) -> (6, 3) (Body, DEAD).\nIf S1 goes for (1, 0): (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) [My body]\n\nAha! (5, 4) is MY body. If S1 moves LEFT to (6, 4), and then tries LEFT again at T=61 to (5, 4), S1 will die.\n\nS1 needs to navigate around my body cluster (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2).\n\nS1 path to (1, 0):\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) [L] -> (5, 4) [L] (RISK: MY BODY)\nS1 might go for (2, 4) instead.\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) (MY BODY)\n\nS1's lower right quadrant is very restricted by my massive tail section and its own long body. This makes S1's move potentially predictable: prioritize the high visibility, low immediate collision risk apple (9, 5).\n\nSince I am slower to (9, 5), I must pivot. I need to move to a position that sets me up for the TL cluster (1, 6) / (2, 6) or (2, 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN (8, 8). This keeps both LEFT and RIGHT options open for T=61.\nIf I move RIGHT (9, 9). I commit to the wall. Only DOWN is safe for T=61.\n\nI need maximum maneuverability to find a path through my body segments.\n\nLet's stick to the plan of working left/down carefully. Moving DOWN to (8, 8) seems the most beneficial for accessing future apples without immediately trapping myself.\n\nT=60: Move DOWN to (8, 8).\n\nLong-Term Plan (LTP): Target (1, 6) / (2, 6) cluster.\nT=60: DOWN (8, 8). (Safe.)\nT=61: DOWN (8, 7). (Safe.)\nT=62: LEFT (7, 7). (Safe.) This is the crucial point for checking my interior body boundaries.\nT=63: DOWN (7, 6). (Safe.)\nT=64: DOWN (7, 5). (Safe.)\nT=65: DOWN (7, 4). (Check S1 position). If S1 moved to (8, 4), (7, 4) is S1's new body segment, highly likely. Wait, T=60: S1 H: (7, 4). S1 moves. If S1 moves (8, 4), then (7, 4) becomes S1 body segment. If I move to (7, 4) at T=65, that body segment would have evacuated five turns ago if S1 didn't eat. Since S1 likely ate, the segment remains 5 steps behind S1's head, which will be around (8, 9). (7, 4) will be part of the body.\n\nIf (7, 4) is dangerous, I must swing left earlier.\n(7, 6) -> (6, 6) (My body, dangerous)\n(7, 6) -> (6, 6) is M=4 from (8, 9). My tail is still at (2, 2). If I don't eat, my tail moves to (3, 2) at T=61, then (4, 3) at T=62, (4, 4) at T=63, (5, 4) at T=64, (5, 5) at T=65, (5, 6) at T=66, (4, 6) at T=67, etc.\n(6, 6) is clear at T=66 or later if I don't eat. I need to get there much sooner (T=63).\n\nThis confirms the central upper board movement is extremely restricted by my body unless I manage to grow quickly and accelerate the tail movement.\n\nLet's try to pass through Column 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n(8, 9) [H]\n(8, 8) [D]\n(8, 7) [D]\n(7, 7) [L]\n(6, 7) [L] -> **TRAP / Collision with my body.**\n\nOnly the border columns (0, 1, 8, 9) and the low rows (0, 1, 2) are guaranteed safe from my own body movements in the short term.\n\nSince (9, 5) is likely lost to S1, I must maximize movement towards the left side.\n\n(8, 9) -> DOWN (8, 8). (Safe, preserves options).\n\nIf S1 gets (9, 5) at T=62, their length increases to 14.\n\nMy plan continues to be DOWN to move away from the dense center of my mass.\n\nT=60: DOWN (8, 8).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\nS1 avoided (9, 5) last turn (by moving UP instead of potentially RIGHT). S1 is now in the center. (9, 5) might still be contested, but it requires S1 to move RIGHT, then RIGHT again.\nS1 to (9, 5): (7, 5) -> (8, 5) [R] -> (9, 5) [R]. (2 steps).\nS1 to (2, 6): (7, 5) -> (7, 6) [U] -> (6, 6) [L] -> (5, 6) [L] (My body, dangerous unless tail moves 5, 6 is vacated at T=62, impossible).\nS1 to (1, 0): S1 has a complicated path now due to S0's body density near row 4.\n\nThe closest and highly appealing apple for S1 is now (9, 5) (2 steps) or (7, 6) is available now to move closer to (1, 6)/(2, 6). If S1 moves UP (7, 6), only 3-4 steps to (2, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (8, 5), it will eat (9, 5) next turn (T=62).\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple Targets for Snake 0**\n\n*   (9, 5): S1 is 2 steps away (R, R). I am 3 steps away from (9, 5) if I move RIGHT: (8, 8) -> (9, 8) [R] -> (9, 7) [D] -> (9, 6) [D] -> (9, 5) [D]. Wait, (9, 5) is 3 steps away from me: (8, 8) -> (9, 8) [R] -> (9, 7) [D] -> (9, 6) [D]. No, (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5). That's 4 steps total. (9, 8) -> (9, 7) (1) -> (9, 6) (2) -> (9, 5) (3). 3 steps from (9, 8), 4 total. Still slower than S1 (2 steps if S1 moves R, R).\n\n*   (1, 6) / (2, 6) cluster: This is still my main goal, as it establishes superior position.\n\n*   (2, 4): This is close to my tail base and S1's current position.\n\n**Plan A: Move LEFT (7, 8) towards the TL cluster.**\n(8, 8) -> (7, 8) [L]. Safe.\nT=62: From (7, 8): (7, 7) [D]. Safe.\nT=63: From (7, 7): (6, 7) [L]. **DANGER:** (6, 7) is my body segment. Tail is currently (4, 3) and will vacate (4, 4) at T=62, (5, 4) at T=63, (5, 5) at T=64. (6, 7) will be T+4 steps away, so it won't be vacated until T=65 or T=66. I need to avoid (6, 7).\n\nIf I go (7, 7), I must go DOWN (7, 6) to keep going left/down safely, or potentially RIGHT (8, 7) (moving backward).\n\n**Plan B: Move DOWN (8, 7) to drop below the congestion.**\n(8, 7) [D]. Safe.\nT=62: From (8, 7): (8, 6) [D] -> (8, 5) [D] -> (7, 5) [L] (S1 Head location T=61). (7, 5) will be S1 body/new head if S1 moves.\n\nWe must anticipate S1's move. S1 is most likely to move R (8, 5) to grab (9, 5) or U (7, 6) to consolidate center position.\n\nCase S1 moves R (8, 5): (8, 5) blocked. (7, 5) becomes S1 body segment.\nIf I head towards (8, 5), I collide with S1 head or body next turn. Moving DOWN is dangerous if S1 moves RIGHT.\n\nCase S1 moves U (7, 6): (7, 6) blocked. (7, 5) becomes S1 body segment.\nIf I move DOWN (8, 7), then DOWN (8, 6), then DOWN (8, 5), then LEFT (7, 5) -> collision with S1 body (7, 5).\n\nSince I am trying to move LEFT/DOWN, but the center is highly dynamic and congested, staying out of the way vertically seems preferable for T=61.\n\n**Let's choose RIGHT (9, 8)**\nThis commits me to the right wall, avoiding immediate danger from S1 and setting me up to move DOWN along the boundary until the coast is clear to cut left later, potentially below the main body mass. This is a very safe strategy given the high density of my own body.\n\nT=61: RIGHT to (9, 8). (Safe. Board edge).\nT=62: DOWN to (9, 7). (Safe).\nT=63: DOWN to (9, 6). (Safe).\nT=64: DOWN to (9, 5). (Apple, if S1 hasn't taken it).\n\nLet's assume S1 takes (9, 5) at T=62. S1 will move (7, 5) -> (8, 5) (R) -> (9, 5) (R, eats A). S1 length 14.\nIf S1 does this, at T=62, S1 Head is (9, 5). My Head is (9, 7).\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\nT=61: (9, 8). Safe.\nT=62: (9, 7) [D]. Safe.\nT=63: (9, 6) [D]. Safe.\nT=64: (9, 5) [D]. S1 Head or body (9, 5) if S1 ate the apple.\n\nIf S1 eats (9, 5) at T=62, (9, 5) becomes S1 head. At T=63, S1 Head moves, and (9, 5) becomes S1 body. S1 length is 14. Its tail is constantly moving. For me to hit S1 body at (9, 5) at T=64, I need S1's body segment (that was Head at T=62) to still be there. S1 body will be 2 segments behind Head. S1 tail moves length/turn. S1 tail moves 1 cell per turn. If S1 is 14 long, its body segment (9, 5) will vacate at T=62 + 14 = T=76.\n\nSo if S1 takes A(9, 5), S1's body will block (9, 5), (9, 6), maybe (9, 7) for several turns depending on S1's path.\n\nIf S1 moves UP (7, 6) aiming for TL apples:\nS1 H: (7, 6).\nMy move RIGHT (9, 8) is completely safe and sets me up for the empty (9, 4), (9, 3) area and ability to swing left near R4.\n\nConsidering the high congestion in the center of the board caused by my own body, moving to the edge (RIGHT) and securing safety is the best immediate step for T=61. I can then drop down to get below my body mass and navigate back left towards (1, 0) or (2, 4).\n\n**Short Term Plan (T=61 to T=63):** Use the right wall to drop down to safety.\nT=61: RIGHT (9, 8)\nT=62: DOWN (9, 7)\nT=63: DOWN (9, 6)\nIf (9, 5) is still available, I can go for it at T=64. If not, I can continue down (9, 5)/(9, 4) if S1's body hasn't fully blocked the path, or cut LEFT.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n*   LEFT (7, 5): Into S1 body (neck). **DEATH.**\n*   RIGHT (9, 5): Apple A(9, 5). Safe and very appealing.\n\nS1 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (9, 5) and eat the apple. This is only 1 step away. S1 will grow to length 14.\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple Targets/Strategy for Snake 0**\n\nMy current position (9, 8) is on the right edge. The primary goal from the last turn was to use the edge to safely drop down below the main body mass.\n\nIf I move DOWN (9, 7):\n*   T=63: I will be at (9, 7). From here:\n    *   DOWN (9, 6): Safe. (2 steps towards A(9, 5) if S1 doesn't get it, but S1 IS getting it this turn).\n    *   LEFT (8, 7): Safe. Moves me off the wall.\n\nIf I move UP (9, 9):\n*   T=63: I will be at (9, 9). This is the corner.\n    *   DOWN (9, 8): Moving backward. Safe, but inefficient.\n    *   LEFT (8, 9): Into my body (8, 9) is my second segment (H: 9, 8, B1: 8, 8, B2: 8, 9). NO, (8, 9) is my *third* segment.\n        S0 Body start: (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), ...\n        If I move UP to (9, 9), (8, 9) is not my neck. My neck is (8, 8).\n        (8, 9) is my B2 segment. Since my length is 18, (8, 9) will not be vacated for many turns. Moving LEFT (8, 9) is **DEATH**.\n\nTherefore, moving UP (9, 9) is only safe if I immediately move DOWN again, which is pointless. I must move DOWN (9, 7).\n\n**Move DOWN (9, 7)**\nThis move continues the strategy of moving along the right boundary to bypass the dense concentration of my own snake body in the center/upper left section.\n\nAnticipated T=63 board state:\nS1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5) and eats the apple, length 14. Head (9, 5). (9, 5) is now S1's head.\nS0 moves DOWN to (9, 7). Head (9, 7).\n\nAt T=63 from (9, 7):\n*   UP (9, 8): Safe (moving backwards).\n*   DOWN (9, 6): Empty. Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 7): Empty. Safe.\n*   RIGHT (10, 7): EDG!\n\nIf S1 is at (9, 5) (Eats apple):\nS1's head position might block future moves. S1 will likely move away from the wall to open space, maybe (8, 5) (Down/Left). Wait, (8, 5) is S1's current head location. S1 would likely go to (9, 4) (Down) or (8, 5) (Left/Up).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 4), S1 H: (9, 4). (9, 5) is S1 B1.\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 5), S1 H: (8, 5). (9, 5) is S1 B1.\n\nIf S1 moves R, A(9, 5) is gone. I need to aim for (2, 4) in the center or the TL cluster (1, 6)/(2, 6).\nMoving DOWN is essential to get separation from my bulk.\n\nT=62: DOWN (9, 7).\nT=63: (9, 6).\nT=64: (9, 5). Wait, if S1 Head is (9, 5) at T=62, at T=63, (9, 5) is S1 Body. Since S1 is length 14, S1 body at (9, 5) will be a solid block for many turns.\n\nIf (9, 5) is blocked, I should focus on cutting left earlier, perhaps after getting to (9, 6) or (9, 5) if S1 moves away from the wall.\n\nPlan updated: Move DOWN to (9, 7). This is the only safe progressive move and allows me to navigate freely along the boundary or cut inward towards the currently empty lower half of the board.\n\nDOWN",

Tail (4, 3) will be vacated if no apple is eaten.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (ID 1) Head: (9, 5).\nBody segments: (8, 5) (Neck), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0).\nLength: 14 (assuming S1 ate (9, 5) last turn). Based on the body list provided, S1's length is 1 + 13 = 14. Tail (3, 0) will be vacated.\n\nApples at: (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (9, 7))**\n\n*   **Move UP (9, 8):** Into my body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move DOWN (9, 6):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (8, 7):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (10, 7):** Off board. **DEATH.**\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN (9, 6) and LEFT (8, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (9, 5))**\n\nS1's current position (9, 5) is on the right edge. S1 has a body segment (8, 5) to the left.\nS1 Safe moves from (9, 5):\n*   UP (9, 6): Empty.\n*   DOWN (9, 4): Empty.\n*   LEFT (8, 5): Into body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n*   RIGHT (10, 5): Off board. **DEATH.**\n\nS1 must move UP (9, 6) or DOWN (9, 4).\n\n**3. Collision Check**\n\n*   If S0 moves DOWN (9, 6) and S1 moves UP (9, 6): **HEAD-ON COLLISION.** Both die.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (8, 7): Collision is avoided regardless of S1's move, as S1 is far away.\n\n**4. Strategy and Apple Assessment**\n\nMy goal is to get away from my massive body structure and head towards the lower apples (1, 0), or the central apple (2, 4), or the (3, 5) apple.\n\nIf I move DOWN (9, 6):\nThis brings me down the wall, which is consistent with the previous turn's goal. However, S1 might preemptively block me or collide with me at (9, 6). Since S1 is at (9, 5), S1 moving UP to (9, 6) is a plausible, easy move. This is a high-risk move for S0.\n\nIf I move LEFT (8, 7):\nThis is a guaranteed safe move. It brings me inward, away from the wall and opens up the grid for movement.\nFrom (8, 7):\n*   (8, 6): Safe. (Towards A(1, 6), A(2, 6), A(2, 4), A(3, 5))\n*   (7, 7): Safe. (Further inward)\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 6):\nS1 is now blocking the clear path along the wall. S1 is also now closer to me, which is generally bad.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 4):\nS1 is moving away from me and towards the bottom half of the map. This is beneficial for S0 if S0 wants to use the wall path later.\n\nGiven the immediate risk of a head-on collision at (9, 6) if S1 chooses UP, the safest and still progressive move is LEFT (8, 7). This guarantees survival and moves me toward the central area where most remaining apples are.\n\n**5. Final Decision: LEFT**\nMoving LEFT to (8, 7) avoids the potential immediate collision with S1 at (9, 6) and opens up the board for S0 to navigate towards the central apples.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAt (8, 7), I will have immediate access to (8, 6), (7, 7), (9, 7) (backward), and (8, 8) (blocked by my body). From (8, 7), I should aim to move DOWN/LEFT to get to the lower quadrant or central area, possibly targeting (3, 5) or (2, 4).\n\nLEFT",

Tail (4, 0) will be vacated.\n\nApples at: (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (8, 7))**\n\n*   **Move UP (8, 8):** Into my body. **DEATH.** ((8, 8) is 3rd segment of my body list after neck (9, 7))\n*   **Move DOWN (8, 6):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 7):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 7):** Into my body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN (8, 6) and LEFT (7, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (9, 4))**\n\nS1's current position (9, 4) is on the right edge, slightly below us.\nS1 Safe moves from (9, 4):\n*   UP (9, 5): Into body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n*   DOWN (9, 3): Empty. Safe.\n*   LEFT (8, 4): Empty. (Note: (8, 5) is S1's body, but (8, 4) is free). Safe.\n*   RIGHT (10, 4): Off board. **DEATH.**\n\nS1 must move DOWN (9, 3) or LEFT (8, 4).\n\n**3. Collision Check**\n\nS0 is at (8, 7). S1 is at (9, 4). The closest potential conflicting cells are far apart. S0 moves are (8, 6) or (7, 7). S1 moves are (9, 3) or (8, 4). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**4. Strategy and Apple Assessment**\n\nI need to move towards the cluster of apples in the center-left: (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), and (3, 5).\n\n*   **If S0 moves DOWN (8, 6):** This is a direct path downward. From (8, 6), I could aim for (7, 6) towards (1, 6)/(2, 6).\n*   **If S0 moves LEFT (7, 7):** This is moving inward, slightly away from the column of my body parts (9, x and 8, x). From (7, 7), I could aim for (6, 7) or (7, 6).\n\nBoth moves lead towards the apples.\n\nLet's look at the density of my own body:\n- If I go DOWN (8, 6), I am still adjacent to the long vertical segment of my body (9, 7), (9, 8), (x, x). I also have (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7) below me. This route seems a bit congested by my own segments if I try to move further down or left.\n- If I go LEFT (7, 7), this allows movement towards (7, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6) etc., opening up the central area.\n\nLet's analyze the paths to the nearest apples:\n\nApple (3, 5):\n*   From (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) (Body!) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) (Body!) -> This path is blocked due to S0's length.\n\nApple (2, 4):\n*   (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) (Body!) -> Blocked\n\nI must move away from my own large body loop that occupies (4, 4) to (6, 9).\n\n(8, 7) -> (8, 6) [DOWN]\nFrom (8, 6), the path (7, 6) is open.\n(8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) (Body!)\n\nWait, let's recheck the body segments:\nBody segment list: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4)]\n\nCheck access from (8, 6):\nNeighbors: (7, 6) [Open], (9, 6) [Open], (8, 7) [Body], (8, 5) [Open].\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 6), then moving left to (7, 6) seems good. This is a path towards A(1, 6) and A(2, 6) and A(2, 4).\n\nCheck access from (7, 7):\nNeighbors: (6, 7) [Body], (8, 7) [Body], (7, 8) [Open], (7, 6) [Open].\n(6, 7) is my 10th segment. So moving LEFT (7, 7) then DOWN to (7, 6) is possible. The problem with (7, 7) is that (6, 7) is blocked, forcing me up or down.\n\nIf I move DOWN (8, 6):\nNext turn I can move LEFT (7, 6). This is an excellent cell, opening up the western side. (7, 6) is adjacent to A(1, 6) and A(2, 6) two steps away.\n\nIf I move LEFT (7, 7):\nNext turn I can move DOWN (7, 6). Same destination (7, 6), but the path is one step longer: (8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6).\n\nAh, wait. Moving LEFT to (7, 7) is slightly less constrained because from (7, 7), I have two non-backwards open directions: (7, 8) and (7, 6). The path (8, 7) -> (7, 7) is one step further from the busy right side.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 6):\nNon-backwards open directions: (7, 6), (9, 6), (8, 5). 3 options.\n\nLet's prioritize reaching the apples (1, 6) and (2, 6) which are close to the west wall. (2, 4) and (3, 5) are also attractive.\n\nTarget (7, 6) seems like the best intermediate step.\n\nPath 1: DOWN (8, 6). Safe. Next move likely LEFT to (7, 6).\nPath 2: LEFT (7, 7). Safe. Next move likely DOWN to (7, 6).\n\nBoth moves are viable and lead to the central area. (8, 6) keeps me in a column with more visibility down the board, which might be marginally better for pathfinding around S1's potential locations (9, 3) or (8, 4).\n\nIf S1 goes (8, 4), they are moving toward me, but still 2 squares away.\nIf S1 goes (9, 3), they are moving away.\n\nLet's stick with the most direct move towards the central board area, which is DOWN to (8, 6). This seems marginally superior as it immediately prepares for a move Left/Down into lower X coordinates without navigating around another snake's potential upward diagonal movement (if S1 had more choices).\n\nI choose DOWN (8, 6).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove towards (7, 6) next turn, then probe for the western apples (1, 6) and (2, 6), or if those are too constrained, move further south towards (2, 4) or (1, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Snake 1 moved from (9, 4) to (9, 3). My previous assessment that (8, 5) was open was based on evaluating the board *before* the last turn's movement, or I missed S1's body segments. Looking at the current S1 body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), ...]. Yes, (8, 5) is S1's 3rd segment. (If S1 moves away from (8, 5), it might be vacated, but (8, 5) is currently occupied). **DEATH.**\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 6):** Empty cell. Safe.

Strategy and Path Selection**\n\nThe objective is to move towards the dense cluster of apples in the west-center: (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 6):** This is the ideal move. It takes immediate advantage of my current position, moving directly into the available space necessary to approach (1, 6) and (2, 6). From (7, 6), I have good pathfinding options:\n    *   DOWN (7, 5) (open) towards (3, 5), (2, 4).\n    *   LEFT (6, 6) (open).\n    *   UP (7, 7) (open).\n    (7, 6) is a very open location.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 6):** This moves me back towards the corner and the heavily occupied columns (8, X) and (9, X). It leads away from *all* apples. This is primarily a stalling/safety move, not an aggressive apple-seeking move.\n\nSince LEFT (7, 6) is safe, it must be the priority.\n\n**5. Long-term plan**\nCurrent head (8, 6). Move to (7, 6). Next turn, assess the apples (1, 6) and (2, 6). If (6, 6) is open, move there to prepare for an immediate strike on (2, 6). If (6, 6) is closed (which it shouldn't be), or if a snake threatens the south, move down through (7, 5).\n\nLEFT\n**Long-term plan:**\nThe current move is LEFT to (7, 6), positioning Snake 0 centrally and adjacent to the cluster of apples (1, 6) and (2, 6). Next turn, I should aim to move LEFT again to (6, 6) or DOWN to (7, 5), depending on enemy positioning and internal snake body flow. The ultimate goal is to consume the apples in the (1-3, 4-6) region.\nLEFT",

(Adjacent to apples (1, 6) and (2, 6)).\n*   **Move RIGHT (8, 6):** Into my body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n\nTwo safe moves: UP (7, 7) and LEFT (6, 6).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (8, 3))**\n\nS1 is primarily focusing on the lower quadrant.\nS1 Safe moves from (8, 3):\n*   UP (8, 4): Empty. Safe. (Adjacent to apple (2, 4)).\n*   DOWN (8, 2): Empty. Safe.\n*   LEFT (7, 3): Body segment S1: (7, 3). **DEATH!**\n*   RIGHT (9, 3): Into body (Neck). **DEATH.**\n\nS1 must move UP (8, 4) or DOWN (8, 2). S1 is slightly closer to apple (2, 4) than I am to any apple, but that apple is also surrounded by S1's lower body (7, 3) and (7, 4). S1 will likely move UP to (8, 4) to approach the center apples (2, 4) and (3, 5).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves (S0)**\n\nS0 is at (7, 6). Apples are clustered around (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (6, 6):** This moves directly towards apples (1, 6) and (2, 6). It provides good access to the entire cluster. This is the most advantageous move strategically.\n    *   Future options from (6, 6): UP (6, 7 - open) or LEFT (5, 6 - my body/tail). The cell (5, 6) *is* currently part of my body, but it is $3$ segments from the tail (5, 5). So, unless I eat an apple, $5 segments will remain$ occupied by tail segments. Actually, the tail (5, 5) will vacate. My body segments are T ... (5, 6), (5, 5).\n    *   Body segment list: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), ..., (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)]. The 17th segment is (5, 6), the 18th/tail is (5, 5). If I move to (6, 6) and don't eat, (5, 6) becomes the tail, and (5, 5) is vacated. So L (5, 6) is a suicide move.\n    *   From (6, 6), I could move LEFT to (5, 6) into my own body, or DOWN to (6, 5).\n    *   The apple (2, 6) is 4 steps away: (6, 6) -> (5, 6) X / (6, 5) -> (5, 5) X / (6, 5) -> (5, 5) X / (6, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) A / (4, 6) T -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) A.\n\n    Let's re-examine body collision for (6, 6):\n    *   (6, 6) is safe this turn.\n    *   Next turn from (6, 6):\n        *   UP (6, 7): Safe.\n        *   DOWN (6, 5): Safe.\n        *   LEFT (5, 6): Body segment (4th from tail). **DEATH.**\n        *   RIGHT (7, 6): Backwards (Neck). **DEATH.**\n    *   Moving LEFT (6, 6) is still the best strategic choice this turn, placing me near the apple cluster, but I must plot my subsequent moves carefully to avoid my own body mass concentrated on the west side.\n\n*   **Move UP (7, 7):** This move takes me away from the apples and pushes me towards the top wall, though it is very open. It's a conservative move.\n\n**4. Conflict and Priority**\n\nI need to focus on the apple cluster. Moving LEFT to (6, 6) is crucial for controlling that central western area of the board.\n\nPotential enemy moves: S1 moves to (8, 4) or (8, 2).\nIf S1 moves to (8, 4), S1 is now in the central area, potentially aimed for (2, 4) or (3, 5).\nIf I move to (6, 6), I maintain control of the north-western approach to the apples.\n\nThere is no immediate collision threat with S1. S1 is 3 cells away (8, 3) -> (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 goes to (8, 4), S1 is 4 moves from (3, 5) and 6 moves from (2, 4).\nIf I go to (6, 6), I am 5 moves from (2, 6) (via 6, 7 -> 5, 7 X -> 5, 7 T / 6, 7 -> 6, 8 T -> 6, 9 T) -- wait, routing through my own body is hard here.\nLet's find the fastest route to (2, 6) from (6, 6) without hitting body:\n(6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5 evacuated/T) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) (Apple, eat!)\nThis route leads to (3, 5) (4 steps), but (3, 5) is not (2, 6).\n\nRoute to (2, 6):\n(6, 6) -> (6, 7) (open) -> (5, 7) (my body) X.\n(6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) (vacant) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) (Apple).\n(6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) (Apple). Long, but possible.\n\nIf I prioritize (3, 5) first, moving LEFT to (6, 6) allows for (6, 5) next turn, which is good positioning.\n\nIf I move UP (7, 7), I get stuck quickly near my body (7, 9), (8, 7), (8, 6).\n\nMoving LEFT (6, 6) is the only aggressive, apple-seeking move, despite the risk of getting body-locked next turn. I must commit to the west side.\n\n**5. Constraint Check: Next Turn Move**\nIf I move to (6, 6).\nNext turn S0 must go to (6, 7) or (6, 5). (6, 5) looks better as it bypasses the body congestion above.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move LEFT towards the apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 6). Next turn, aim DOWN to (6, 5) to bypass the body segment (5, 6) and approach the center apples (3, 5) and (2, 4). This aggressive push is necessary given S1's proximity to the center.\n\nLEFT",

Tail (7, 0) will be vacated.\n\nApples at: (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n\nBoard state:\n 9 . . . . . T T T T .\n 8 . . . . . T T . T T\n 7 . . . . T T T . T T\n 6 .

The previous head (7, 6) is now the neck/segment 2. The head is at (6, 6). T represents '0' body or '1' body/tail segments).*\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: (6, 6))**\n\n*   **Move UP (6, 7):** My body segment [(6, 7)]. **DEATH!**\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 5):** Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 6):** My body segment (Tail). If I move here, since the tail (5, 6) *would be* vacated, this is only safe if I eat an apple. However, there is no apple at (5, 6). **DEATH!**\n    *   *Check: Head (6, 6). Body list ends (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6). (5, 6) is the 18th segment/tail. If I don't eat, length 17, (5, 6) is vacated. If I move into (5, 6) without eating, I hit the tail segment before it vacates.* Rule: \"The last point in the body list (the tail) is vacated after the move, unless the snake eats an apple and grows.\" Moving into your own body is a collision unless that segment is the tail and a move is made *away* from it, or if you eat an apple. Moving into the **current** tail position is always DEATH unless you eat an apple there (which is not the case). The tail position must be evaluated *before* the move. If I move to (5, 6), I hit my body. **DEATH!**\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 6):** My body segment (Neck). **DEATH!**\n\nOnly one safe move: DOWN (6, 5).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Snake #1 (Head: (8, 4))**\n\nS1 is at (8, 4). S1 is slightly closer to the apples (2, 4) and (3, 5).\nS1's potential moves from (8, 4):\n*   UP (8, 5): Snake 1 body segment (7th segment from head). **DEATH!**\n*   DOWN (8, 3): Snake 1 body segment (Neck). **DEATH!**\n*   LEFT (7, 4): Snake 1 body segment (8th segment from head). **DEATH!**\n*   RIGHT (9, 4): Snake 1 body segment (4th segment from head). **DEATH!**\n\nWait, S1 is trapped! If S1 moves into *any* adjacent cell, it dies.\nBody list for S1: [(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)]\n\n*   (8, 5) is 5th segment, DEATH. (Correct)\n*   (8, 3) is Neck, DEATH. (Correct)\n*   (7, 4) is 7th segment, DEATH. (Correct)\n*   (9, 4) is 3rd segment, DEATH. (Correct)\n\nSnake 1 dies this turn, regardless of its move choice.\n\n**3. Strategy for Snake 0**\n\nSince S1 dies, I should ensure I pick the optimal move to secure future apples.\nI must move DOWN (6, 5).\n\nMove DOWN (6, 5) leads me towards apples (2, 4) and (3, 5).\n\n*   (6, 5) -> (5, 5) is potentially open next turn (if (5, 6) was the tail this turn and S0 did not grow, (5, 5) is currently empty and adjacent to vacated (5, 6)).\n*   (3, 5) is 3 steps away: (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5) [Apple!] if the path is clear.\n    *   (5, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   (4, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   (3, 5) is an apple!\nThis path looks optimal.\n\n**4. Long-term plan**\nI move DOWN to (6, 5). Next turn, I will aim LEFT to (5, 5) to approach (3, 5). S1 dies this turn, clearing the central board for me.\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN.\n\nDOWN",
