So you are length 1.\n- There are apples at (6,3), (1,1), (5,4), (3,6), (3,2).\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (2,6) (also length 1).\n\nPossible moves from (4,2):\n- UP: (4,3)\n- DOWN: (4,1) - but note: y=1 is valid (range 0-9), and there is an apple at (1,1) but that's not directly relevant.\n- LEFT: (3,2)\n- RIGHT: (5,2)\n\nNow, check each for immediate death:\n\n1. UP (4,3): \n   - Check if off-board: y=3 is within 0-9, valid.\n   - Check if into own body: no body segments, so safe.\n   - Check if into enemy body: enemy head is at (2,6), body is none. So no enemy body to hit.\n   - Also, no other snakes' heads are moving into (4,3) this turn? We need to predict enemy moves.\n\n2. DOWN (4,1):\n   - Valid coordinate.\n   - No self-collision.\n   - No enemy body at (4,1).\n\n3. LEFT (3,2):\n   - Valid.\n   - No self-collision.\n   - There is an apple at (3,2)! So if we move LEFT, we eat that apple and grow to length 2 (head at (3,2) and tail at (4,2) for next turn).\n\n4. RIGHT (5,2):\n   - Valid.\n   - No self-collision.\n   - No enemy body.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (2,6). It has no body, so it can move in any direction without self-collision. Possible moves: UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6). Note there is an apple at (3,6), so the enemy might be tempted to go RIGHT to eat it.\n\nBut for our moves, we don't see any immediate danger from the enemy for this turn. However, we should avoid moving into cells that the enemy might also move into (head-on collision). But since the enemy is far away (at (2,6)), it is unlikely to collide with us this turn.\n\nTherefore, all four moves are safe this turn.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n- Moving LEFT to (3,2) lets us eat an apple immediately. This is highly beneficial: we grow to length 2 and gain a point.\n- Other moves do not get an apple this turn.\n\nSo LEFT is the best move.\n\nAlso, after eating, our head will be at (3,2) and our tail at (4,2). This gives us flexibility for next moves.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- After eating the apple at (3,2), we will have a body segment at (4,2). Next turn, we can consider moving towards other apples (e.g., (1,1) or (5,4) or (6,3)).\n- We should avoid moving backwards into our tail (which would be at (4,2)) but that is not an issue for next turn since we can move in any direction except backwards (which would be RIGHT from (3,2) to (4,2) - but that would be into our own body and kill us). So we must avoid RIGHT next turn.\n- For now, eating the apple is the priority.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

You just ate the apple at (3,2) last turn.\n\nApples are at: (6,3), (1,1), (5,4), (2,4), (5,0) \u2014 note the apple at (3,2) is gone.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at head (3,6) with body [(2,6)] (length 2). It might have moved last turn (possibly to eat the apple at (3,6)? But that apple isn't listed now, so it might have eaten it? Actually, the apples listed are current, so (3,6) is not an apple now \u2014 meaning snake #1 might have eaten it? But the board state shows \"T 1\" at (3,6)? Wait, the board state from last turn showed an apple at (3,6) and enemy head at (2,6). Now enemy head is at (3,6) and body is [(2,6)], so it likely moved RIGHT to (3,6) and ate that apple. So snake #1 now has 2 apples (as per scores: it had 1, now it should have 2? But the scores say \"Snake #1 apples: 1\" \u2014 this might be a typo? Actually, the turn is still 1? Wait, the turn says \"Turn: 1 / 150\", meaning we are at turn 1? But we already made a move? This is confusing.\n\nActually, the header says \"Turn: 1 / 150\", but we have \"Your last move information\" which was LEFT. So this is the start of turn 2? The board state is after turn 1? Let me clarify:\n\n- The board state shown is after turn 1? Actually, the board state is labeled as \"Board state:\" and it shows your head at (3,2) and body at (4,2), which is after you moved LEFT to (3,2) and ate the apple. So this is the state at the beginning of turn 2.\n\nSo, for turn 2:\nYour head is at (3,2), body at (4,2).\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (3,6), body at (2,6).\n\nApples: (6,3), (1,1), (5,4), (2,4), (5,0)\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,2):\n- UP: (3,3)\n- DOWN: (3,1)\n- LEFT: (2,2)\n- RIGHT: (4,2) \u2014 but this is your own body! So RIGHT is suicidal.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nCheck other moves for immediate death:\n- UP (3,3): within board, not your body (only body is at (4,2)), not enemy body (enemy body is at (2,6)).\n- DOWN (3,1): valid, safe.\n- LEFT (2,2): valid, safe.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (3,6). It can move UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6) (but that is its own body!), RIGHT (4,6). So it cannot move LEFT (into its body). So it has UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe need to avoid head-on collisions. Our moves are far from enemy (we are at y=2, enemy at y=6), so no immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n- We want to go towards apples. The closest apples are (2,4) and (1,1) and (5,4). (2,4) is above and left; (1,1) is down and left; (5,4) is above and right.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- UP (3,3) gets closer to (2,4) and (5,4) (both at y=4).\n- DOWN (3,1) gets closer to (1,1) (at y=1).\n- LEFT (2,2) is neutral.\n\nAlso, we have to consider future moves: after this move, we will have a body at (3,2) and (4,2). So we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nIf we go UP to (3,3), next turn we can go UP to (3,4) to get closer to (2,4) or (5,4), or LEFT to (2,3), etc.\nIf we go DOWN to (3,1), we can go DOWN to (3,0) or LEFT to (2,1) towards (1,1).\nIf we go LEFT to (2,2), we can go UP to (2,3) towards (2,4), or DOWN to (2,1) towards (1,1).\n\nAll are reasonable.\n\nBut note: there is an apple at (2,4) which is very close. Moving UP then LEFT would be efficient.\n\nAlso, we should avoid moving into areas where the enemy might come, but enemy is far.\n\nSo, UP seems good to go towards the apples at y=4.\n\nDOWN is also good for (1,1), but (1,1) is farther? Actually, (1,1) is at distance |3-1| + |2-1| = 3, while (2,4) is |3-2| + |2-4| = 1+2=3, same. But (2,4) is directly above and left.\n\nSince UP is safe and moves towards multiple apples, choose UP.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid RIGHT, which is dead.\n\nSo, UP is best.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, head at (3,3), body at (3,2) and (4,2). Then next turn, we can go UP to (3,4) to get even closer to (2,4) and (5,4), or LEFT to (2,3). We should plan to collect (2,4) soon.\n\nUP",

You have collected 2 apples.\nApples are at: (6,3), (5,4), (2,4), (5,0), (4,3)\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (2,5) with body at (2,6). It has collected 1 apple.\n\nPossible moves from your head (2,1):\n- UP: (2,2) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (2,0) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- LEFT: (1,1) \u274c your own body segment (immediate death)\n- RIGHT: (3,1) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo LEFT is fatal. Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, enemy head at (2,5) can move:\n- UP: (2,6) \u274c its own body\n- DOWN: (2,4) \u2705 safe (empty) - but note there is an apple at (2,4)\n- LEFT: (1,5) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- RIGHT: (3,5) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo enemy's possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Importantly, DOWN leads to (2,4) which has an apple.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go UP to (2,2) - no collision risk (enemy cannot reach (2,2) in one move).\nIf you go DOWN to (2,0) - no collision risk.\nIf you go RIGHT to (3,1) - no collision risk.\n\nTherefore, all safe moves are collision-free this turn.\n\nGoal: collect apples safely. The closest apples are at (2,4) and (4,3). (2,4) is very close and directly above. However, the enemy might also move to (2,4) to eat the apple. If you both move to (2,4) simultaneously, it would be a head-on collision and both die.\n\nIf you go UP to (2,2), you are one step away from (2,3) and then (2,4). But if the enemy goes DOWN to (2,4) this turn, it will eat the apple and grow. Then next turn, if you go to (2,4), you might collide with the enemy's body? Actually, if the enemy eats the apple at (2,4) this turn, its head becomes (2,4) and it grows, so its body extends to include (2,5) (old head) and (2,6) (old body). Then next turn, (2,4) is occupied by the enemy's body, so you cannot go there without dying.\n\nAlternatively, if you go RIGHT to (3,1), you can then go to (3,2), (3,3), etc., to approach (4,3) or (5,4). This avoids direct competition for (2,4).\n\nConsidering the enemy might go for (2,4), it is risky to aim for it directly. Instead, we should go for (4,3) or (5,4) which are less contested.\n\nFrom (2,1):\n- UP to (2,2): sets up to go to (2,3) and then (2,4) - but risky if enemy is also going there.\n- DOWN to (2,0): moves away from apples.\n- RIGHT to (3,1): moves toward (4,3) and (5,4).\n\nRIGHT seems better to avoid the enemy and target the apples at (4,3) and (5,4). Also, (5,0) is far and not worth going down for.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (3,1), we can go UP to (3,2) and then to (3,3) or (4,3) to eat the apple at (4,3). This path is safe and avoids the enemy at (2,5). We should monitor the enemy's movement and avoid getting too close.\n\nRIGHT is the best move to head toward the apples while minimizing risk.\n\nRIGHT",

The closest apples are at (4,3) and (5,1). (5,1) is very close: from (3,1), going RIGHT to (4,1) then UP to (4,2) and RIGHT to (5,2) then DOWN to (5,1) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, (4,3) is also close: from (3,1), going UP to (3,2), then UP to (3,3), then RIGHT to (4,3) to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, note that (5,1) is also reachable and might be less contested. The enemy is at (2,4) and is likely to move away from that area (since it has no apples directly adjacent). It might go for (4,3) or (5,4) eventually.\n\nFrom (3,1):\n- UP to (3,2): sets up to go to (3,3) and then (4,3) to eat the apple at (4,3). This is a good path.\n- DOWN to (3,0): moves away from most apples (except (5,0), which is far).\n- RIGHT to (4,1): moves toward (5,1) and also allows going up to (4,2) and then to (4,3) or (5,4).\n\nRIGHT is particularly attractive because it gets us closer to (5,1) and also opens up paths to (4,3) and (5,4). Also, (5,1) is only two moves away: RIGHT to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1) (but note: (5,1) is an apple, so we need to check if it's safe next turn). Alternatively, we can go RIGHT then UP to (4,2) and then to (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nGiven that (5,1) is very close and there is no immediate threat, RIGHT seems best to target that apple quickly.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (4,1), we can evaluate next turn: if (5,1) is still there and safe, we can go RIGHT to (5,1) to eat it. Otherwise, we can go UP to (4,2) to approach (4,3) or (5,4). This keeps options open and avoids the enemy at (2,4).\n\nRIGHT is the best move to head toward the apples while minimizing risk.\n\nRIGHT",

The closest apples are at (5,1) (directly RIGHT) and (4,3) (UP then UP then RIGHT). (5,1) is adjacent and can be eaten this turn by moving RIGHT.

Similarly, DOWN to (4,0) moves away from most apples.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to immediately gain an apple and increase your score.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (5,1), your snake will be longer. Next turn, from (5,1), avoid moving LEFT to (4,1) (your body) and consider UP to (5,2) or DOWN to (5,0) (if safe) to continue collecting apples.

Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, enemy head at (4,4) can move:\n- UP: (4,5) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (4,3) \u2705 safe (apple present)\n- LEFT: (3,4) \u274c its own body\n- RIGHT: (5,4) \u2705 safe (apple present)\n\nSo enemy's possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go UP to (5,2) - no collision risk (enemy cannot reach (5,2) in one move).\nIf you go DOWN to (5,0) - no collision risk.\nIf you go RIGHT to (6,1) - no collision risk (enemy cannot reach (6,1) in one move).\n\nTherefore, all safe moves are collision-free this turn.\n\nGoal: collect apples safely. The closest apples are at (5,0) (directly DOWN) and (4,3) (UP then UP then LEFT) and (3,2) (UP then LEFT then DOWN). (5,0) is adjacent and can be eaten this turn by moving DOWN. This would grow your snake to length 5 (head at (5,0), then body at (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)).\n\nEating (5,0) is beneficial: it gives you an apple and grows your snake. It also positions you well for future moves: from (5,0), you can go UP to (5,1) (but that would be backwards into your new body? Actually, after eating, your body will be [(5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)], so moving UP to (5,1) would hit your own body next turn? But that's for next turn; we only consider immediate safety now). Alternatively, from (5,0) you can go RIGHT to (6,0) or LEFT to (4,0) (if safe).\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,0) is safe and immediately collects an apple.\n\nUP and RIGHT are also safe but do not collect an apple this turn. UP to (5,2) sets up for (5,4) or (6,3) in future moves. RIGHT to (6,1) moves towards (6,3) but is less direct.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to immediately gain an apple and increase your score.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (5,0), your snake will be longer. Next turn, from (5,0), avoid moving UP to (5,1) (your body) and consider LEFT to (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0) (if safe) to continue collecting apples. Also, watch for enemy #1 which might be targeting (4,3) or (5,4). Note that (3,2) is also an apple that might be reachable via LEFT and UP.\n\nDOWN",

You have collected 4 apples.\nApples are at: (6,3), (5,4), (3,2), (9,9), (6,9)\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (4,3) with body at (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). It has collected 3 apples.\n\nPossible moves from your head (5,0):\n- UP: (5,1) \u274c your own body segment (immediate death)\n- DOWN: (5,-1) \u274c off the board (immediate death)\n- LEFT: (4,0) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- RIGHT: (6,0) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo UP and DOWN are fatal. Safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, enemy head at (4,3) can move:\n- UP: (4,4) \u274c its own body\n- DOWN: (4,2) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- LEFT: (3,3) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- RIGHT: (5,3) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo enemy's possible moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go LEFT to (4,0): enemy cannot reach (4,0) in one move (needs to go LEFT then DOWN? Actually, enemy moves one step: closest it can get is (3,3), (4,2), or (5,3) - none is (4,0)). So no collision risk.\nIf you go RIGHT to (6,0): enemy cannot reach (6,0) in one move (enemy max x is 5,3). So no collision risk.\n\nTherefore, both safe moves are collision-free this turn.\n\nGoal: collect apples safely. The closest apples are at (6,3) (RIGHT then UP then UP then RIGHT? Actually from (6,0): go UP to (6,1), then UP to (6,2), then UP to (6,3) - but that requires three moves) and (5,4) (LEFT then UP then UP then RIGHT? From (4,0): go UP to (4,1), then UP to (4,2), then RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3), then UP to (5,4) - longer). Also (3,2) is accessible via LEFT and UP.\n\nHowever, note that (9,9) and (6,9) are far away.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe and lead to open areas. From (4,0), you can go UP to (4,1) (but note your body is at (4,1) - so next turn that would be fatal? Actually, after moving LEFT to (4,0), your body becomes [(4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]? Wait, you have 4 apples so length is 5: head at (5,0) and body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). After moving LEFT to (4,0), the new head is (4,0), and the body becomes [ (4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ]? Actually, the tail (2,1) is dropped because you didn't eat an apple. So your new body is [(4,0), (5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]? Wait, the order is head-first: head moves to (4,0), then the old head (5,0) becomes the next segment, then (5,1), then (4,1), then (3,1) (tail). So the body segments are: (4,0) head, then (5,0), then (5,1), then (4,1), then (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (6,0): head at (6,0), body: [(6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)].\n\nNow, for future moves:\nFrom (4,0):\n- UP: (4,1) \u274c your own body (segment #4)\n- DOWN: (4,-1) \u274c off board\n- LEFT: (3,0) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- RIGHT: (5,0) \u274c your own body (segment #2)\n\nSo only LEFT is safe from (4,0). That leads to (3,0), which is a dead-end? From (3,0), you can go UP to (3,1) \u274c your body, or LEFT to (2,0) \u2705 safe, or RIGHT to (4,0) \u274c your body. So only LEFT is safe. This is very restrictive.\n\nFrom (6,0):\n- UP: (6,1) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (6,-1) \u274c off board\n- LEFT: (5,0) \u274c your own body (segment #2)\n- RIGHT: (7,0) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. This gives more options.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,0) is better because it keeps more future moves open (UP and RIGHT) and avoids getting trapped. Moving LEFT to (4,0) forces you to go LEFT again to (3,0) and then only LEFT to (2,0), which is a dead-end path.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT gets you closer to the apple at (6,3) (via UP moves) and (6,9) (long term). The enemy is at (4,3) and might be heading towards (5,4) or (3,2), so staying to the right might be safer.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,0), go UP to (6,1) (if safe) to start moving towards (6,3) and (6,9). Avoid getting too close to the enemy at (4,3) until you have a size advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

But you are at (6,0) and going UP to (6,1) doesn't conflict immediately.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (6,1) to approach (6,3). Next turn, if safe, go UP to (6,2). Then UP to (6,3) if apple is still there. But be cautious of enemy at (5,3) moving to (6,3) this turn. If enemy eats (6,3), then you can aim for (5,4) or (6,9). Alternatively, if enemy goes to (5,4), you can still get (6,3).\n\nSince both moves are safe, but UP is more aligned with apple collection and opens a path north, prefer UP.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (6,1), if UP to (6,2) is safe, take it. Then assess for (6,3). Avoid head-on with enemy if it approaches. Also consider moving towards (6,9) if other apples are taken.\n\nUP",

You have collected 4 apples, so your length is 5.\nApples are at: (5,4), (3,2), (9,9), (6,9), (7,7)\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (6,3) with body: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)]. It has collected 4 apples.\n\nPossible moves from your head (6,1):\n- UP: (6,2) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (6,0) \u274c your own body segment (immediate death)\n- LEFT: (5,1) \u274c your own body segment (immediate death)\n- RIGHT: (7,1) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are fatal. Safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\nNow, enemy head at (6,3) can move:\n- UP: (6,4) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (6,2) \u2705 safe (empty) - note: this is adjacent to your head\n- LEFT: (5,3) \u274c its own body (segment #2)\n- RIGHT: (7,3) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo enemy's possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go UP to (6,2): enemy could go DOWN to (6,2) - same cell! This would cause a head-on collision and both die.\nIf you go RIGHT to (7,1): enemy cannot reach (7,1) in one move (enemy moves to max (6,4), (6,2), or (7,3)). So no collision risk.\n\nTherefore, UP is risky due to potential head-on collision with enemy moving DOWN. RIGHT is safe.\n\nGoal: collect apples safely. The closest apples are (5,4) and (6,9). From your head (6,1):\n- UP: (6,2) is a step towards (6,9) but risky.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) is away from immediate apples but safe.\n\nFuture moves:\nFrom (7,1) if you go RIGHT:\n- UP: (7,2) \u2705 safe (empty)\n- DOWN: (7,0) \u2705 safe (empty) - but note: your body is at (6,0) and (5,0), so (7,0) is free.\n- LEFT: (6,1) \u274c your body (segment #1) - but wait, after moving RIGHT, your body becomes [(7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1)]? So (6,1) is your body segment. So LEFT is fatal.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) \u2705 safe (empty)\n\nSo from (7,1), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. This gives good options.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (7,1) to avoid head-on collision risk. Then consider moving UP towards (7,7) or (6,9), or DOWN to (7,0) and then LEFT to approach (5,4) from below. Avoid enemy at (6,3) which might be moving towards (5,4) or (6,4). Since enemy has same apple count, we need to be cautious.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (7,1), assess apples and enemy positions. Consider moving UP to (7,2) to approach (7,7) or (6,9), or DOWN to (7,0) to circle towards (5,4) or (3,2). Keep options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Your body segments: [(7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (6,0)] (so length 5).\nApples at: (5,4), (3,2), (9,9), (6,9), (7,7)\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,6) with body: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] (length 5).\n\nPossible moves from your head (7,3):\n- UP: (7,4) - currently empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (7,2) - your own body segment (immediate death)\n- LEFT: (6,3) - currently occupied by enemy snake #1's body (segment #3) (immediate death)\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - currently empty (safe)\n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT. DOWN and LEFT are fatal.\n\nNow, enemy head at (6,6) can move:\n- UP: (6,7) - empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (6,5) - its own body (segment #1) (fatal)\n- LEFT: (5,6) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - empty (safe)\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is fatal.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go UP to (7,4): enemy cannot reach (7,4) in one move (max to (6,7), (5,6), (7,6)) - no risk.\nIf you go RIGHT to (8,3): enemy cannot reach (8,3) - no risk.\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nNow, consider apples:\n- (7,7) is directly above you (UP direction).\n- (6,9) and (9,9) are top-right.\n- (5,4) is left and up (but blocked by enemy body at (6,3) and (5,3)).\n- (3,2) is left and down.\n\nFrom (7,3):\n- UP (to (7,4)): moves towards (7,7) and (6,9)/(9,9). This is promising.\n- RIGHT (to (8,3)): moves away from most apples, but might be safe.\n\nFuture moves from each:\nIf UP to (7,4): next moves could be UP to (7,5) towards (7,7), or RIGHT to (8,4) to approach (9,9), or LEFT to (6,4) but note (6,4) is enemy body? Currently enemy body at (6,4) is segment #2. But after enemy moves, it might vacate. However, enemy might move UP to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6). So (6,4) might become safe next turn? But risky if enemy stays. Alternatively, from (7,4), UP and RIGHT are safe.\nIf RIGHT to (8,3): next moves: UP to (8,4) safe, DOWN to (8,2) safe, RIGHT to (9,3) safe. LEFT to (7,3) is body (fatal). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good options.\n\nUP leads directly towards (7,7) which is close. RIGHT moves away from apples but keeps options open.\n\nGiven that (7,7) is very close (only 3 moves away: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) then (7,7)), moving UP is efficient for collecting apples. Also, enemy is at (6,6) which is adjacent to your path (if you go UP to (7,4), enemy might go to (7,6) or (5,6)), but no immediate conflict.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (7,4) to approach (7,7). This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\nNext turns: From (7,4), move UP to (7,5) if safe (check enemy at that time). If enemy moves to (7,6), be cautious. Alternatively, if enemy blocks, consider RIGHT to (8,4) to go around.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove UP to approach (7,7). From (7,4), next move likely UP to (7,5) and then (7,6) to reach (7,7). Monitor enemy at (6,6) which might move to (7,6) or (5,6). If enemy moves to (7,6), consider alternative paths like RIGHT to (8,4) and then (8,5) to approach (9,9) or (6,9). Avoid head-on collisions.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

Wait: last turn you moved DOWN to (8,2) which had an apple. So after eating, your length becomes 6. However, the body list provided is still length 5? Actually, the body list is given as [(8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2)] - this is 5 segments. But you collected 5 apples so far, meaning initial length 1 + 5 = 6. There is a discrepancy: the body list should have 6 segments including the head? Actually, the head is separate: \"Head: (8,2)\" and body has 5 segments, so total segments = 6. So you are length 6 now.\n\nApples at: (5,4), (3,2), (9,9), (6,9), (1,1) - note (8,2) was eaten last turn, so it's no longer listed.\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,8) with body: [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5)] (length 6).\n\nPossible moves from your head (8,2):\n- UP: (8,3) - your own body segment (immediate death)\n- DOWN: (8,1) - currently empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (7,2) - your own body segment (immediate death)\n- RIGHT: (9,2) - currently empty (safe)\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nNow, enemy head at (6,8) can move:\n- UP: (6,9) - contains an apple (safe, and will eat it to grow to length 7)\n- DOWN: (6,7) - empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (5,8) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - its own body (fatal)\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is fatal.\n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:\nIf you go DOWN to (8,1): enemy cannot reach (8,1) in one move (max to (6,9), (6,7), (5,8)) - no risk.\nIf you go RIGHT to (9,2): enemy cannot reach (9,2) - no risk.\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nConsider apples:\n- The closest apple is (1,1) but it's far.\n- (3,2) is also relatively close.\n- (5,4) is farther.\n- (6,9) and (9,9) are far.\n\nFrom (8,2), moving DOWN to (8,1) gets you closer to (1,1) and (3,2) but requires going left/down.\nMoving RIGHT to (9,2) doesn't get you much closer to any apple.\n\nAlso, enemy is likely to go UP to (6,9) to eat the apple there, growing to length 7. So you need to catch up.\n\nLong-term plan: You should aim for the apples at (3,2) or (1,1). From (8,2), going DOWN to (8,1) is a step in that direction. Then you can continue down/left towards (1,1) or (3,2). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,2) might lead to a dead-end in the corner.\n\nCheck future moves from (8,1):\n- UP: (8,2) - your body? But you will move away, so it might be safe later? Actually, after you move, your tail moves too (since you didn't eat an apple this turn). So next turn, your body will be: head at new pos, then old head becomes body, and tail moves? Since you didn't eat, the tail moves away. So from (8,1), next turn:\n   If you go DOWN to (8,1), then your new body will be [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,3)] (tail (7,2) is gone). So (8,2) becomes free.\nSo from (8,1), possible next moves:\n   UP: (8,2) - free (safe)\n   DOWN: (8,0) - free (safe)\n   LEFT: (7,1) - free (safe)\n   RIGHT: (9,1) - free (safe)\nSo all directions safe next turn.\n\nFrom (9,2):\n   UP: (9,3) - free\n   DOWN: (9,1) - free\n   LEFT: (8,2) - your body? But wait: after moving to (9,2), your body becomes [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,3)] so (8,2) is body. So LEFT to (8,2) is fatal.\n   RIGHT: off board (fatal)\nSo from (9,2), only UP and DOWN are safe next turn. This is restrictive.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (9,2) leads to a corner with only 2 safe moves next turn, while moving DOWN to (8,1) gives 4 safe moves next turn.\n\nSo DOWN is better for future options.\n\nAlso, DOWN moves you towards the apples at (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN to (8,1).\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue down/left towards (1,1) and (3,2). Avoid getting trapped in corners. Monitor enemy movement.\n\nDOWN",

Your body has grown: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (3,2)? Wait, no - the head moved to (3,2) and the apple was there, so the new body segment is added at the head.

(1,7) is near the enemy area.\n\nStrategy: Since you and enemy both have 7 apples, you need to collect efficiently. Moving LEFT towards (1,1) and (0,0) seems good. RIGHT leads towards (5,4)/(5,5) but also towards the enemy area. UP goes away from apples initially.\n\nLEFT (to (2,2)) is a safe move that gets you closer to (1,1) and (0,0). From (2,2), next moves could be LEFT to (1,2) then DOWN to (1,1) for the apple, or DOWN to (2,1) but that is your body? Actually (2,1) is empty - your body is at (3,1) and below.\n\nLEFT is the best direction to target the bottom-left apples while avoiding the enemy. It also keeps you in open space with multiple options.\n\nRIGHT is also safe but moves you towards the center and potentially towards the enemy later. UP is safe but moves you away from the immediate apples.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: After LEFT to (2,2), consider moving LEFT again to (1,2) or DOWN to (2,1) to approach (1,1). Avoid moving into your own body. The enemy is still constrained in the top-right, so focus on collecting the bottom-left apples quickly.\n\nLEFT",

So safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (7,7), body: [(8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)] - length 8 including head. Enemy has safe moves from its position: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) - but RIGHT (8,7) is its own body, so actually UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nStrategy: The closest apples are (1,1) and (0,0) in the bottom-left. Moving LEFT to (1,2) gets you closer to these apples. DOWN to (2,1) also moves you toward (1,1) but might be slightly less direct. UP moves away from the immediate apples.\n\nFrom (1,2), you could then move DOWN to (1,1) to get the apple next turn. This path seems efficient.\n\nLEFT is also safe and maintains multiple options - from (1,2) you can go LEFT to (0,2), DOWN to (1,1), or UP to (1,3).\n\nDOWN to (2,1) is also safe and gets you closer to (1,1), but your body is at (3,1) which might constrain future moves downward.\n\nUP to (2,3) is safe but moves you away from the immediate apples and toward the center where the enemy might eventually go.\n\nGiven that you and the enemy both have 7 apples, collecting the bottom-left apples quickly is advantageous. LEFT seems optimal.\n\nPlan for next turns: After LEFT to (1,2), move DOWN to (1,1) to collect the apple. Then consider moving to (0,0) or other directions based on new apple spawns. Avoid moving into your own body and monitor enemy movement.\n\nLEFT",

Let me check: from (0,0), moves would be UP (0,1), RIGHT (1,0), DOWN off-board. UP would be into neck segment after tail advances \u2014 risky if timing wrong; safer to go right to (1,0) next.

Your body: [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] \u2014 length 10 (since you just ate the apple at (0,0) last turn).\n\nApples at: (5,4), (1,7), (6,4), (6,6), (7,8)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (5,5), body: [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)] \u2014 length 9.\n\nFrom your head at (0,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (0,1) \u2014 currently occupied by your own body (neck segment). However, since you just ate an apple and grew, your tail hasn't moved yet. On the next simultaneous move, your entire body will shift forward. So after the move, the neck segment (currently at (0,1)) will become the new head position? Wait no: the head moves first, then each segment follows.\n\nImportant: The body segments follow the head. So if you move UP to (0,1), that cell is currently occupied by your neck. But after the move, the head will be at (0,1), and the neck (previously at (0,1)) will move to the next segment? Actually, the entire snake moves: the head moves to the new cell, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if you move UP to (0,1), the current segment at (0,1) will move to (0,0)? But (0,0) is the head's current position \u2014 that would be backwards? Let's clarify the movement:\n\nSimultaneous movement: all heads move first. Then each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it. So if you move UP to (0,1):\n- Head moves from (0,0) to (0,1)\n- The segment that was at (0,1) (your neck) will move to (0,0) (the head's old position)\n- The next segment moves to the old neck position, and so on.\n\nSo moving UP to (0,1) is safe because after the move, the neck will have moved away to (0,0). So it is not occupied by your body at the time of head movement? Actually, at the moment of head movement, the cell (0,1) is still occupied by your neck. But the rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So if you move into (0,1), which is currently occupied by your neck, that would be lethal.\n\nTherefore, UP is lethal because it moves into your own body (the neck segment at (0,1)).\n\nNow check other directions:\n- DOWN: (0,-1) \u2014 off-board, lethal.\n- LEFT: (-1,0) \u2014 off-board, lethal.\n- RIGHT: (1,0) \u2014 empty? Looking at the board: at (1,0) there is nothing (marked as '.'). So safe.\n\nSo only RIGHT is possible.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1,0), your head will be at (1,0). Your tail (currently at (6,1)) will move to (5,1) because the entire body shifts.\n\nLong-term plan: From (1,0), you can then go UP to (1,1) \u2014 but (1,1) is currently your body? Actually, after the move, the segment at (1,1) will have moved to (0,1) (since the head moved from (0,0) to (1,0), the neck at (0,1) moves to (0,0), and the segment at (1,1) moves to (0,1), etc.). So (1,1) will be free next turn. So you can go UP to (1,1) safely next turn.\n\nThen you can path towards the apples at (5,4) or (6,4) \u2014 these are close. Also (1,7) is above, but enemy snake is near there. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5) and might be going for (6,4) or (6,6). So avoid head-on collisions.\n\nFor now, only RIGHT is safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Your body: [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] \u2014 length 10.\n\nApples at: (1,7), (6,6), (7,8), (8,9), (2,1)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,4), body: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)] \u2014 length 10.\n\nFrom your head at (2,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (2,1) \u2014 currently empty (shown as '.' on the board). Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,-1) \u2014 off-board, lethal.\n- LEFT: (1,0) \u2014 currently occupied by your own body (first segment). After movement, this segment will shift to (2,0), but at the moment of head movement, it is still occupied. So lethal.\n- RIGHT: (3,0) \u2014 empty (shown as '.' on the board). Safe.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, consider the apples: there is an apple at (2,1) directly above you! Moving UP would eat it immediately, growing to length 11. This is highly beneficial.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,0) does not eat an apple.\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (2,1), you will be eating the apple, so your tail won't move (you grow by 1). Your new head will be at (2,1), and your body will extend by adding (2,1) as the new head and shifting the rest. The segment that was at (4,1) (the tail) will remain, so your body becomes: [(2,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] \u2014 length 11.\n\nFrom (2,1), you can then consider next moves: UP to (2,2) is your own body (currently at (1,2) but after growth it shifts? Actually, (2,2) is currently occupied by your body (sixth segment). After growth, it will still be occupied? Wait: when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail doesn't move. So the body segments remain in place except the head moves to the apple. So (2,2) will still be occupied by your body. So UP from (2,1) would be lethal. But you can go LEFT to (1,1) or RIGHT to (3,1). (1,1) is currently your body (fourth segment), and after growth it will still be there? Actually, the segment at (1,1) will shift to (0,1) only if no growth? But with growth, the entire body remains except the head moves. So (1,1) remains occupied. So LEFT to (1,1) is lethal. RIGHT to (3,1) is currently your body (eighth segment), and it remains occupied. So after eating the apple at (2,1), you might be trapped? But wait, the board state after growth: your head is at (2,1), and the body segments are: (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So the cells around (2,1): UP (2,2) is body, DOWN (2,0) is body, LEFT (1,1) is body, RIGHT (3,1) is body. So all adjacent cells are occupied! That means after eating the apple, you will have no safe moves and die next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to eat the apple at (2,1) leads to certain death next turn.\n\nNow, consider moving RIGHT to (3,0). This is safe and does not eat an apple. Your head moves to (3,0), and your tail moves forward: the segment at (4,1) (tail) is removed, and the head moves to (3,0). Your new body becomes: [(3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)] \u2014 length 10.\n\nFrom (3,0), you can then consider next moves:\n- UP: (3,1) \u2014 currently your body (last segment). After movement, it will shift to (3,0), so it becomes free? But at the moment of head movement, it is still occupied. So lethal.\n- DOWN: (3,-1) \u2014 off-board, lethal.\n- LEFT: (2,0) \u2014 currently your body (first segment after head). After movement, it will shift to (3,0), so it becomes free? But at the moment, it is occupied. So lethal.\n- RIGHT: (4,0) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo only RIGHT is safe from (3,0). But that is for next turn.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now to (3,0) keeps you alive for this turn, and next turn you can only go RIGHT to (4,0). Then from (4,0), you can go UP to (4,1) (which is currently your tail? But after moving, it will be free) or RIGHT to (5,0). So you have a path to the right.\n\nLong-term plan: Avoid the apple at (2,1) because it traps you. Instead, move rightward to open space. Then head upward towards the apples at (1,7) or (6,6). The enemy snake is at (6,4) and might be going for (6,6). You are shorter (10 vs 10? Actually both are length 10 now) so avoid direct confrontation. Prefer to go for (1,7) which is closer and less contested.\n\nFor this turn, UP is lethal next turn, so only RIGHT is safe.\n\nRIGHT",

Your body: [(3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] \u2014 length 10.\n\nApples at: (1,7), (7,8), (8,9), (2,1), (7,6)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (6,6), body: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8)] \u2014 length 12 (11 apples + 1 head).\n\nFrom your head at (4,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (4,1) \u2014 currently empty (shown as '.' on the board). Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,-1) \u2014 off-board, lethal.\n- LEFT: (3,0) \u2014 currently occupied by your own body (first segment). After movement, it will shift to (4,0), but at the moment, it is occupied. So lethal.\n- RIGHT: (5,0) \u2014 empty (shown as '.'). Safe.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (6,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,7) \u2014 occupied by its own body (segment at (6,7)), lethal.\n- DOWN: (6,5) \u2014 occupied by its own body (first segment), lethal.\n- LEFT: (5,6) \u2014 occupied by its own body (segment at (5,6)), lethal.\n- RIGHT: (7,6) \u2014 empty and has an apple at (7,6). So likely it will go RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, enemy will likely move to (7,6) and grow to length 13.\n\nFor your moves:\n- UP to (4,1): This moves you toward the apple at (2,1), but note that your body is at (3,2) and (2,2), so you need to navigate carefully. From (4,1), next moves could be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN would be back to (4,0), which might be safe if tail moves).\n- RIGHT to (5,0): This moves you rightward, opening more space. From (5,0), next moves could be UP or RIGHT (DOWN off-board, LEFT to (4,0) which will be your body).\n\nLong-term plan: You are behind in apples (9 vs 11). You need to collect apples safely. The apple at (2,1) is close but risky due to your body winding. The apples at (1,7) and (7,8) are good targets. Since enemy is going for (7,6), it will be near (7,7) next turn. Avoid direct confrontation. Moving UP gets you closer to (2,1) and then you can go left/up to (1,7). Moving RIGHT gets you into open space but away from apples. Prefer UP to start moving toward the cluster of apples at top left.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,0) \u2014 occupied by your own body (fifth segment). Lethal.\n- LEFT: (1,1) \u2014 occupied by your own body (ninth segment).

The closest is (1,3) \u2014 move LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT. Also consider (1,7) and (3,7). Avoid the enemy snake #1 which is larger and to the right. Your priority is to collect apples safely to catch up in score (10 vs 12).\n\nGiven that only UP is safe, that's the move.\nUP",

RIGHT to (3,2):\n   - Moves away from the closest apples (1,3) and towards enemy territory (snake #1 is at right).\n   - From (3,2), next moves: UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1) \u2014 your body, LEFT (2,2) \u2014 your head's previous position (now body), RIGHT (4,2) \u2014 empty.\n        So safe: UP and RIGHT.\n   - Not ideal as it doesn't help catch up to enemy score.\n\nBest move is UP to (2,3). It provides good options next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) and moves directly towards the apple cluster at (1,3) and (1,7). Avoid LEFT which restricts next moves, and RIGHT which moves towards danger.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (2,3), aim for apple at (1,3) by moving LEFT to (1,3) next turn. Then continue upwards to (1,7) or other apples. Stay in the top-left quadrant to avoid the larger enemy snake #1 which is dominating the right side.

Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) \u2014 occupied by your own body (first segment). Lethal.\n- LEFT: (1,3) \u2014 apple! Safe (eating apple grows you).\n- RIGHT: (3,3) \u2014 currently empty ('.').

LEFT to (1,3): \n   - Immediately eat apple (gain 1 apple, now 11 vs enemy 12).\n   - After eating, your head becomes (1,3), and you grow by 1 segment \u2014 new body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), ...] (length 12).\n   - Next turn from (1,3): \n        UP: (1,4) \u2014 empty (safe)\n        DOWN: (1,2) \u2014 empty (safe) \u2014 note: your tail is at (0,1), so (1,2) is free.\n        LEFT: (0,3) \u2014 empty (safe)\n        RIGHT: (2,3) \u2014 your body (first segment) \u2014 lethal\n   So safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good options.\n\n2.

Safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n   - Good for long-term pathing but misses immediate apple.\n\n3. RIGHT to (3,3):\n   - Moves away from the closest apple (1,3) and towards enemy territory.\n   - From (3,3), next moves: UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2) \u2014 your body, LEFT (2,3) \u2014 your body, RIGHT (4,3). Safe: UP and RIGHT.\n   - Less ideal as it doesn't help close the score gap.\n\nBest move is LEFT to (1,3) to eat the apple immediately. This closes the score gap (11 vs 12) and gives good next moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Avoid RIGHT which is risky and UP which delays eating.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (1,3), consider moving UP to (1,4) or LEFT to (0,3) to avoid trapping yourself. Then aim for apple at (1,7) by going UP. Stay in top-left to avoid enemy #1.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (4,9):\n   - Collects the apple at (4,9), growing to length 15.\n   - Excellent strategic move - gets you closer to winning.\n   - After eating, your new head would be at (4,9), and your tail would remain in place (since you grow).\n   - From (4,9), next moves: DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9) - all currently empty.\n   - Highly recommended.\n\n2. DOWN to (4,7):\n   - Moves away from the apple cluster.\n   - From (4,7), next moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7) - but (3,7) is your body, so limited.\n   - Less strategic value.\n\n3. RIGHT to (5,8):\n   - Doesn't collect the apple immediately but positions you for future moves.\n   - From (5,8), next moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8) - all empty.\n   - Still keeps the (4,9) apple reachable next turn.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (4,4) and appears to be moving in a pattern that doesn't immediately threaten your position. The (4,9) apple is right above you - this is an optimal opportunity.\n\nUP is clearly the best move as it collects the apple immediately, grows your snake, and puts you in a strong position to pursue other apples (like (7,8) or (8,9)) next.\n\nLong-term plan: After collecting (4,9), consider moving toward (7,8) or (8,9) apples. The enemy snake #1 is still shorter than you (13 vs your new 15) and focused on the bottom area, giving you control of the top-right. Maintain awareness of potential head-on collisions if the enemy moves upward.\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT gives you better positioning and more options to collect the (8,9) apple next, then potentially move down toward (7,8).\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving right toward (8,9) apple, then consider moving down toward (7,8). The (0,9) apple is also available but would require backtracking. With your length advantage (15 vs enemy's 13), focus on efficient apple collection while maintaining safe movement options.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT to (7,8): This would collect the apple at (7,8), growing to length 16. However, this moves you directly toward the enemy snake's head at (7,7). The enemy could move UP to (7,8) as well, causing a head-on collision and both dying. Or the enemy could move elsewhere. This is risky.\n\n2. DOWN to (8,7): Moves away from immediate danger. From (8,7), next moves could be DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7) (enemy head, dangerous), RIGHT (9,7). This gives you 2 safe directions (DOWN and RIGHT) if the enemy moves away.\n\n3. RIGHT to (9,8): Moves to the edge. From (9,8), next moves could be DOWN (9,7) or LEFT (8,8) (your body, lethal). So only 1 safe direction (DOWN). This is limiting.\n\nLEFT is tempting for the apple but high risk due to potential head-on collision with enemy at (7,7). DOWN is safer and maintains options. RIGHT is too limiting.\n\nLong-term plan: Avoid direct confrontation with enemy snake #1 since you are longer (15 vs 13). After moving DOWN to (8,7), consider moving toward the (9,3) apple or (4,1) apple. The (2,0) apple is also reachable but far. Monitor enemy movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDOWN",

This gives you 2 safe directions (DOWN and RIGHT) if the enemy moves away. However, moving DOWN puts you closer to the bottom edge where there are apples at (2,0) and (4,1).\n\n2. RIGHT to (9,7): Moves to the right edge. From (9,7), next moves could be DOWN (9,6) or LEFT (8,7) (your previous position, but empty now). So 2 safe directions. This moves you toward the apple at (9,3) which is reachable by going DOWN along the right edge.\n\nBoth moves are viable. DOWN moves you toward the cluster of apples at (4,1) and (2,0), while RIGHT moves you toward (9,3). The enemy snake is at (7,6) and might move toward the (4,1) apple as well, so RIGHT might be slightly safer to avoid potential conflict.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (9,7), plan to go DOWN to (9,6) and continue toward (9,3) apple.

DOWN to (9,5): This moves you down the right edge toward the apple at (9,3). From (9,5), next moves could be UP (9,6) (will be empty after move), LEFT (8,5) (empty), or DOWN (9,4) (empty). So multiple safe follow-ups. This progresses directly toward the (9,3) apple.\n\n2. LEFT to (8,6): This moves you away from the edge. From (8,6), next moves could be UP (8,7) (your body), DOWN (8,5) (empty), LEFT (7,6) (occupied by enemy body? (7,6) is part of enemy #1's body - lethal), or RIGHT (9,6) (empty). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. This is risky because LEFT leads to enemy body and UP leads to your own body. It limits future options.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (7,4). It might move toward the apple at (4,1) or (2,0). Moving DOWN keeps you on the right edge and away from the enemy. LEFT is less safe due to proximity to enemy body and fewer escape routes.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue down to (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) to collect that apple. Then consider moving left toward (7,8) apple or further down to (4,1). Avoid the enemy in the center-left.\n\nDOWN is the safer and more strategic move.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (1,6)] - length 15.\n\nApples at: (7,8), (2,0), (9,3), (0,9), (4,1)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (8,4), body: [(7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] - length 13.\n\nFrom your current head position (9,5), possible moves:\n- UP: (9,6) - occupied by your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: (9,4) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (8,5) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,5) - off the board (x=10 invalid), lethal.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nEvaluate options:\n1. DOWN to (9,4): This moves you down the right edge toward the apple at (9,3). From (9,4), next moves could be UP (9,5) (will be empty after move), LEFT (8,4) (occupied by enemy head? enemy head is currently at (8,4) - but note: enemy will also move this turn, so we need to consider possible enemy moves), or DOWN (9,3) (empty and has an apple). However, moving to (8,4) might lead to a head-on collision if enemy moves there? Actually, enemy head is at (8,4), so if you move LEFT to (8,5) and enemy moves UP to (8,5), both heads collide and both die. But for DOWN to (9,4), enemy might move to (9,4)? Enemy can move from (8,4) to UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4), RIGHT (9,4). So RIGHT is a possible move for enemy to (9,4). If you both move to (9,4) same turn, head-on collision and both die. This is risky.\n\n2. LEFT to (8,5): This moves you away from the edge. From (8,5), next moves could be UP (8,6) (empty), DOWN (8,4) (occupied by enemy head - but enemy might move away), LEFT (7,5) (occupied by enemy body? (7,5) is enemy body segment), RIGHT (9,5) (empty). So only UP and RIGHT are safe next moves. However, enemy head is at (8,4). If you move LEFT to (8,5), enemy might move UP to (8,5) as well? That would cause head-on collision. Alternatively, enemy might move elsewhere.\n\nTo avoid head-on collision:\n- For DOWN to (9,4): enemy might move RIGHT to (9,4). We need to predict enemy likely moves.\n- For LEFT to (8,5): enemy might move UP to (8,5).\n\nEnemy likely moves: From (8,4), enemy safe moves? Check:\n- UP: (8,5) - empty? Currently (8,5) is empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (8,3) - empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (7,4) - occupied by its own body (first segment), lethal.\n- RIGHT: (9,4) - empty. Safe.\n\nSo enemy has safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy might go for apple at (4,1) or (2,0)? So DOWN to (8,3) is likely. Or RIGHT to (9,4) to compete for (9,3) apple? But enemy has lower apples (13 vs your 15), so it might avoid risk.\n\nTo be safe, we should avoid cells that enemy might move to.\n\nOption: LEFT to (8,5) is less likely for enemy? Enemy might move UP to (8,5) to chase you? But enemy might prefer DOWN to (8,3) toward apples.\n\nAlternatively, we can move DOWN to (9,4) and hope enemy doesn't choose RIGHT. But this is risky.\n\nAnother idea: move LEFT to (8,5) and then next turn go UP to (8,6) to avoid collision? But this turn, if enemy moves UP to (8,5), we both die.\n\nBest to choose a move that minimizes collision risk.\n\nSince enemy has three choices, probability of collision is 1/3 for each shared cell.\n\nFor (9,4): only if enemy chooses RIGHT (1/3 chance).\nFor (8,5): only if enemy chooses UP (1/3 chance).\n\nBoth have same risk.\n\nBut long-term: DOWN leads to apple (9,3) in two moves. LEFT leads to center where enemy is.\n\nAlso, after moving DOWN to (9,4), if enemy doesn't come, we can get apple next turn.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9,4). If enemy moves to (9,4), we both die, but enemy has lower apples (13 vs 15), so we win if both die? Actually, if both die, game ends and we have more apples (15>13), so we win. So head-on collision is acceptable here because we have higher score.\n\nSimilarly, for LEFT to (8,5): if enemy moves to (8,5), both die and we win.\n\nSo both moves are acceptable risks.\n\nBut DOWN is more direct toward apple.\n\nAlso, after (9,4), we can go to (9,3) for apple.\n\nLEFT to (8,5) doesn't lead directly to any apple.\n\nSo DOWN is better.\n\nTherefore, choose DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: After getting (9,3) apple, consider moving left toward (7,8) apple or down to (4,1). Avoid enemy in center.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)] - length 15.\n\nApples at: (7,8), (2,0), (9,3), (0,9), (4,1)\n\nEnemy snake #1 head is at (8,3), body: [(8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] - length 13.\n\nFrom your current head position (9,4), possible moves:\n- UP: (9,5) - occupied by your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: (9,3) - empty and has an apple.\n- LEFT: (8,4) - occupied by enemy body (first segment? enemy body starts at (8,4)), lethal.\n- RIGHT: (10,4) - off the board (x=10 invalid), lethal.\n\nSo only safe move: DOWN to (9,3) to get the apple.\n\nThis is straightforward. There is no other option. Moving DOWN will collect the apple at (9,3), growing your snake to length 16.\n\nAfter this move, your head will be at (9,3), and your body will extend with the new segment at (9,4) (the current head position). This is safe and beneficial.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,3) and might also be interested in the apple at (9,3)? But note: enemy head is at (8,3), so it can move RIGHT to (9,3) as well. However, if both move to (9,3), it will be a head-on collision. Since we have more apples (15 vs 13), we win if both die. But we prefer to avoid death if possible.\n\nBut in this case, we have no choice: only DOWN is safe. So we must take it.\n\nEnemy might not choose RIGHT because:\n- Enemy safe moves from (8,3): \n  - UP: (8,4) - occupied by its own body (first segment), lethal.\n  - DOWN: (8,2) - empty, safe.\n  - LEFT: (7,3) - empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT: (9,3) - empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nEnemy might avoid RIGHT to avoid collision? But we have no alternative.\n\nGiven that we have higher apples, even if enemy moves RIGHT and we collide, we win. So it's acceptable.\n\nPlan after this move: After getting the apple at (9,3), we will be at (9,3) with length 16. Then we should consider moving LEFT to (8,3) or DOWN to (9,2) to avoid staying in place. But note: enemy might be at (8,3) or move away. We'll assess next turn.\n\nFor now, only DOWN is possible.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)] - length 16 (since you just ate the apple at (9,3) last turn? Actually, last turn you moved DOWN to (9,3) which had an apple, so now you have 17 apples and length 17? Wait, let's clarify:\n\nLast turn, you had 16 apples and length 15 (head at (9,4), body 15 segments). You moved DOWN to (9,3) which had an apple. So now you should have 17 apples and length 16 (head at (9,3), body now includes the old head (9,4) as the first segment, and the tail remains? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end. So your body length becomes 16 (original 15 segments + new segment added at the tail). But the board state shows your head at (9,3) and body starting with (9,4). So indeed, you now have 17 apples and length 17? Wait, no: number of body segments = apples collected. Initially, a snake has length 1 (just head) and 0 apples. Each apple adds one segment. So if you have 16 apples, your length is 17 (head + 16 segments). After eating one apple, you have 17 apples and length 18 (head + 17 segments). But the body list has 16 segments? Actually, the body list does not include the head. So your body list has 16 segments, meaning total length = 17. With 16 apples collected, that matches. After eating the apple at (9,3), you now have 17 apples and length 18 (head + 17 body segments). But the body list provided has 16 segments? Wait, the problem says: \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (9,3), Body: [(9,4), ... , (1,7)]\" which has 16 segments. So length=17, apples=16? But it says \"Apples collected: 16\". So you haven't updated yet? Actually, the board state is after your last move? The turn is 62, and you just moved to (9,3) and ate the apple. So now you should have 17 apples. But the board state still shows \"Apples collected: 16\". This might be a lag in update? Or perhaps the board state is before the move? Actually, the board state is drawn after the move? The text says \"Board state:\" and shows your head at (9,3) with body segments. And apples at: (7,8), (2,0), (0,9), (4,1), (9,0) - note (9,3) is not listed, so it was eaten. So you should have 17 apples. But the scores say \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 16\" - this is inconsistent. Probably the scores are before the move? The board state is after the move. So you actually have 17 apples now.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's rely on the board state: your head is at (9,3), body segments 16, so length=17. Apples collected should be 16 (since initial length=1, each apple adds one segment, so segments = apples). So apples=16. But you just ate one, so it should be 17. There is a discrepancy. Perhaps the board state is before the move? Actually, the problem says \"Turn: 62 / 150\", and \"Your last move information\" shows you moved DOWN to (9,3). So after move, you are at (9,3) and ate the apple. So apples should be 17.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume you now have 17 apples and length 18? But the body list has 16 segments. So length=17, apples=16. This is messy. For safety, I'll use the provided numbers: \"Apples collected: 16\" and body length 16 segments, so total length 17. After eating the apple at (9,3), you now have 17 apples and length 18 (head + 17 body segments). But the body list is not updated? So in the next move, your body will be: head at new position, then (9,3) becomes first body segment, and the tail remains? Actually, when you eat, you don't remove the tail; you add a new segment at the tail. So the body list should be longer. But the provided body list is still the old one? This is problematic.\n\nTo resolve, I'll trust the board state as drawn: your head at (9,3), body: [(9,4), (9,5), ..., (1,7)] (16 segments). So length=17. And apples collected=16. So you haven't grown yet? Or the board state is before the growth? Actually, the growth happens after the move, so at the end of the turn, the tail grows. So for the next move, your body will be longer. But for movement purposes, the current body is as given.\n\nFor safety, I'll consider the current body as obstacles, including your own body segments listed.\n\nNow, from head (9,3), possible moves:\n- UP: (9,4) - occupied by your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: (9,2) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (8,3) - currently empty? But enemy snake #1 head is at (7,3), so (8,3) is empty. However, enemy might move to (8,3) this turn.\n- RIGHT: (10,3) - off board, lethal.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (7,3). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (7,4) - occupied by its own body (third segment? body: [(8,3), (8,4), (7,4), ...] so (7,4) is its body, lethal.\n- DOWN: (7,2) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (6,3) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8,3), and enemy moves RIGHT to (8,3), we have a head-on collision. Since we have 17 apples (assumed) and enemy has 13, we win. But we prefer to avoid death.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (9,2), it is safe regardless of enemy move.\n\nAlso, apples: (7,8), (2,0), (0,9), (4,1), (9,0). The closest is (9,0) which is two steps DOWN.\n\nLong-term: We are in the top-right corner. Moving DOWN towards (9,0) is good. Also, we need to avoid getting trapped. Our body is long and occupies many cells.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9,2) to approach the apple at (9,0). This is safe and gives us options next turn: from (9,2), we can go LEFT or DOWN (RIGHT off board, UP into body). So we need to be careful not to get trapped, but for now DOWN is safe.\n\nLEFT to (8,3) is risky due to possible enemy move to same cell. Even though we win in collision, it's better to stay alive.\n\nSo prefer DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7)] - 16 segments, so total length 17. Apples collected: 16 (so you have 16 apples, meaning you need to eat one more to grow to length 18).\n\nApples available: (7,8), (2,0), (0,9), (4,1), (9,0). The closest is (9,0) at two steps down.\n\nPossible moves from (9,2):\n- UP: (9,3) - occupied by your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: (9,1) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (8,2) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,2) - off board, lethal.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (7,2). Its body: [(7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] - 13 segments, length 14.\nEnemy's possible moves from (7,2):\n- UP: (7,3) - its own body, lethal.\n- DOWN: (7,1) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (6,2) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,2) - empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8,2), there is a risk that enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2) as well. This would cause a head-on collision. Since we have 16 apples and enemy has 13, we would win (our length 17 vs enemy length 14). However, we prefer to avoid collisions if possible to stay alive.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (9,1), it is safe regardless of enemy move.\n\nMoving DOWN also brings us closer to the apple at (9,0). From (9,1), next turn we can move DOWN to (9,0) to eat the apple. After eating, we grow and our tail will extend. This is beneficial.\n\nLong-term: We are in the bottom-right corner. After eating (9,0), we should consider moving left to avoid getting trapped. Our body occupies much of the top and right, so we need to navigate carefully.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9,1) to approach the apple at (9,0). This is safe and sets us up for eating next turn. Avoid LEFT due to potential collision risk.\n\nDOWN",

Apples collected: 16 (so you need to eat one more to grow to length 18).\n\nApples available: (7,8), (2,0), (0,9), (4,1), (9,0). The closest is (9,0) directly below you.\n\nPossible moves from (9,1):\n- UP: (9,2) - occupied by your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: (9,0) - contains an apple! Eating it would grow you to length 18.\n- LEFT: (8,1) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,1) - off board, lethal.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (7,1). Its body: [(7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)] - 13 segments, length 14.\nEnemy's possible moves from (7,1):\n- UP: (7,2) - its own body, lethal.\n- DOWN: (7,0) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (6,1) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) - empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy has three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (9,0), we eat the apple and grow. This is safe because no other snake can reach (9,0) this turn (enemy is at (7,1) and can only move to adjacent cells: (7,0), (6,1), (8,1) - none is (9,0)). So no risk of head-on collision.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8,1), there is a risk that enemy moves RIGHT to (8,1) as well. This would cause a head-on collision. Since we have 16 apples (length 17) and enemy has 13 (length 14), we would win. However, we prefer to avoid collisions if possible to stay alive and continue playing.\n\nMoving DOWN to eat the apple is clearly beneficial: it gives us an apple, grows our length, and avoids any collision risk. After eating, our tail will extend (so we won't move our tail for one turn), and we'll be at length 18.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (9,0), we should move left to avoid getting trapped in the bottom-right corner. Our body occupies much of the top and right, so we need to navigate carefully. Next turn, from (9,0), we can only move LEFT (to (8,0)) or UP (to (9,1)) but UP is our body? Actually, after eating, our body will be longer: head at (9,0), then (9,1) becomes the first body segment? Wait, let's clarify: when we eat an apple, we grow immediately, so the tail doesn't move this turn. So after moving DOWN to (9,0), our head is at (9,0), and the body becomes [ (9,1), (9,2), ... , (3,7) ] and we add a new segment at the tail? Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the tail. So the tail remains in place for this turn. So next turn, when we move, the tail will move normally.\n\nSo from (9,0) next turn, possible moves:\n- UP: (9,1) - occupied by our body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: off board.\n- LEFT: (8,0) - empty.\n- RIGHT: off board.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe. Therefore, we must move LEFT to (8,0) next turn. This is acceptable.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9,0) to eat the apple. Then next turn, move LEFT to (8,0). This is safe and sets us up to continue leftwards.\n\nAvoid LEFT this turn because it risks collision with enemy moving RIGHT to (8,1). Even though we would win, it's better to avoid and get the apple.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move.\n\nDOWN",

Your body segments: [(9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (4,8), (3,8), (3,7)] - 17 segments, plus head at (9,0).\n\nApples available: (7,8), (2,0), (0,9), (4,1), (4,7) - note (9,0) is gone.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at head (6,1), body: [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)], length 14.\n\nPossible moves from your head (9,0):\n- UP: (9,1) - your own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: off board, lethal.\n- LEFT: (8,0) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT: off board, lethal.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe. You must move LEFT to (8,0).\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (6,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,2) - empty? Board shows (6,2) is empty (from board state: row 2 has T at (2,7) and (2,9), but (6,2) is empty).\n- DOWN: (6,0) - empty.\n- LEFT: (5,1) - empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,1) - its own body (first segment), lethal.\n\nSo enemy has safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nMoving LEFT to (8,0) is safe from enemy: enemy cannot reach (8,0) in one move (its moves are to (6,2), (6,0), (5,1)). So no collision risk.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving to (8,0), you'll need to continue leftwards or upwards to avoid being trapped. Your body blocks the right and bottom. Next turn from (8,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (8,1) - empty? Currently empty (enemy is at (6,1), so (8,1) is free).\n- DOWN: off board.\n- LEFT: (7,0) - empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,0) - your previous head, but will be empty? Actually, after you move, your tail might move? Wait: you just ate an apple, so this turn your tail doesn't move. So after you move LEFT to (8,0), your body will be: head at (8,0), then (9,0) becomes first body segment? Actually, when you eat, you grow immediately. So after eating at (9,0), your head is at (9,0) and you have a new segment at the tail. Then when you move to (8,0), your head goes to (8,0), and the tail moves normally? Let's clarify the mechanics:\n\nIn standard Snake:\n- When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the tail. This growth happens immediately, so the tail does not move that turn.\n- On the next turn, when you move, the tail moves normally (so the last segment is removed and a new segment is added at the head).\n\nSo this turn (turn 65), you moved DOWN to (9,0) and ate the apple. So your tail did not move. Your body is now 18 segments long: head at (9,0), then segments [(9,1), (9,2), ..., (3,7)] and the tail is still at (3,7)? Actually, the growth adds a new segment at the tail, so the tail remains at (3,7) (it doesn't move), and you have an extra segment there? But typically, the tail doesn't move when you eat, so the tail stays in place and you become longer.\n\nThen on turn 66 (this move), you will move LEFT to (8,0). Then your head moves to (8,0), and your tail moves (the last segment is removed). So your new body will be: head at (8,0), then (9,0), (9,1), ..., up to the segment before the tail. The tail (which was at (3,7)) will be removed, and you'll have a new tail at the next segment.\n\nSo after moving to (8,0), your head is at (8,0), and your body includes (9,0) and (9,1), etc.\n\nNext turn from (8,0):\n- UP: (8,1) - should be empty (currently no snake there).\n- DOWN: off board.\n- LEFT: (7,0) - empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,0) - your body (first segment), lethal.\n\nSo next turn you can go UP or LEFT.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (8,0) now. Then next turn, prefer UP to (8,1) to start moving towards the center and available apples (like (4,1) or (4,7)). Avoid going too far left into the enemy territory? Enemy is at (6,1), so (8,1) is safe for now.\n\nSo for this turn, only one safe move: LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

From (8,2), next turn you could go UP to (8,3), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2) (but (9,2) is your body, so only UP/LEFT would be safe).

However, (7,2) is enemy body, and (6,1) is enemy body, so LEFT might lead to a trap.\n\nBoth moves have risks, but UP seems better because it moves you toward the apples and away from the enemy. The enemy is at (4,1) and moving away from you, so (8,2) should be safe. Also, your long-term goal is to collect apples, and UP gets you closer to (7,8) and (4,7).\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving UP to (8,2), consider moving LEFT to (7,2) if safe, to approach the apple at (7,8). Avoid moving into the enemy's body segments.\n\nUP",

This means you must have died on the previous turn. However, since the game is continuing, I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the board state.\n\nLooking at the board representation:\nRow 2: \". . . . 1 . . T 0 T\" - this shows your head (0) at (8,2) and enemy head (1) at (4,2). The 'T' at (7,2) and (9,2) are tails? But according to the body lists, (7,2) is enemy body and (9,2) is your body.\n\nWait, the board state uses 'T' for tail segments, but both snakes have moved since the body lists were recorded. The body lists are from the previous turn, and after moving, some tail segments may have moved.\n\nActually, the rules state that snakes move simultaneously. So the body lists provided are for the current state before moving? But the head position is given as (8,2) for you and (4,2) for enemy, which suggests this is after the move? This is confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Turn: 68 / 150\" - this is the current turn number. The state is given for the start of turn 68. So the head positions and body lists are current at the start of turn 68.\n\nYour head is at (8,2), which means you moved UP last turn as planned. The enemy head is at (4,2), which means enemy moved UP as well.\n\nNow, for your possible moves from (8,2):\n- UP to (8,3): Currently occupied by enemy body? The enemy body list includes (8,3) as a segment. So moving UP would hit enemy body.\n- DOWN to (8,1): Your own body (first segment).\n- LEFT to (7,2): Enemy body (segment at (7,2)).\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Your own body (segment at (9,2)).\n\nSo indeed, all four moves are lethal. This means you are trapped and have no safe move. The only possibility is if the enemy moves away from (8,3) and (7,2), but since moves are simultaneous, you cannot rely on that.\n\nHowever, since the game is continuing, I must have misinterpreted. Perhaps the body lists are from the previous turn, and the head positions are new? But the description says \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (8,2) Body: [...]\" which implies the body includes the current segments.\n\nAnother possibility: when a snake moves, the tail moves forward, so some tail cells might become free. But in this case, your body has 17 segments plus head, so length 18. When you move, you don't eat an apple, so you don't grow, and the tail moves. Therefore, the cell (9,2) might be freed if it was the tail? But looking at your body list, the last segment is (4,9), so (9,2) is not the tail.\n\nActually, your body list: [(8,1), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), ...] so (9,2) is your body and not the tail. Similarly, enemy body has (8,3) and (7,2) as segments.\n\nSo indeed, you have no safe move. This is a critical situation. The only hope is that the enemy might move away from the cells you are considering, but since moves are simultaneous, you cannot know.\n\nGiven that all moves are lethal, I must choose one arbitrarily. Perhaps UP is the best, hoping that the enemy moves its head away from (8,3), but that is unlikely.\n\nWait, the enemy head is at (4,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,3)\n- DOWN to (4,1) - its own body (first segment)\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n- RIGHT to (5,2)\n\nSo enemy has safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It might move UP to (4,3) or LEFT to (3,2), away from your area.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (4,3), then (8,3) remains occupied by enemy body, and (7,2) remains occupied. So no change.\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3,2), same.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5,2), same.\n\nSo no matter what, the enemy body segments remain in place.\n\nTherefore, you have no escape. This is the end.\n\nBut since I must choose a move, I'll choose UP, as it was the intended direction.\n\nUP",
