The apple at (6,1) is closest (Manhattan distance 2).\n   - Avoiding head-on collisions: The enemy head is at (0,1).

The immediate risk is low.\n   - Moving LEFT is slightly better than DOWN because it keeps more options open and is directly towards the apple at (6,1).\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Next turn, move DOWN to (6,1) to eat the apple.

Positioned directly below (0,9) apple (1 UP move away); no obstacles to eating it immediately.\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1)**: Head at (7,5), Body: [(7,4)] (length 2). Apples: 1. Likely to move UP to (7,6) for an easy apple eat, increasing to 2 apples. Distance is far (Manhattan ~10), so no immediate threat to me or my intended path. They could compete for the central/right cluster ((7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,8)) but won't reach it all in one turn.\n- **Apples**: (0,9) is isolated, zero-risk, and high-reward (gains me 2 apples vs enemy likely hitting 2 if they eat). The right cluster is closer to enemy (Manhattan closer), so allow them to potentially focus there while I secure the easy one and then reposition.\n- **Board obstacles**: X=0 wall limits LEFT; Y=9 top row; no other immediate blocks. Own body is behind/at (0,7), preventing DOWN/backwards.\n- **Safe moves**:\n  - UP: To (0,9), directly onto apple (eat it, grow to length 3, apples to 2). Post-grow, only RIGHT safe (to 1,9), but as detailed in last rationale's forward simulation, this quickly opens to multiple options (e.g., RIGHT then DOWN to 1,8, then RIGHT/UP/DOWN exploration). Increases apples now without enemy interference; distant enough to avoid head-on. Keeps paths open for maneuvering left/right/top later.\n  - RIGHT: To (1,8), empty. Length 2, no grow. Options: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), RIGHT (2,8). Good mobility but delays eating the isolated apple while enemy might eat theirs, letting them catch up in apples. Doesn't increase score this turn.\n  - DOWN: Into own body (0,7), backwards move, dies.\n  - LEFT: Off board, dies.\n- **Collision risks**: Head-on impossible (they'd need ~7 RIGHT moves minimally to even approach x midline). If they predict me eating, they might shift strategy, but unlikely given their prime UP option.\n- **Growth/Options**: UP eats safely, advances apples (critical for winning), and maintains open flexibility post-eat (can loop back to x=0 midline/center via RIGHT then LEFT-esque maneuvers after growth). RIGHT preserves length but lags in scoring. Prioritize eating apples over pure maneuvering in early game with no threats.\n\nUP maximizes apples gained without risk, aligning with scoring objective. Enemy will likely eat too, keeping parity unless they skip; secure the easy point. Post-eat plan: RIGHT to (1,9) for space, then DOWN to (1,8) to mirror current (1,8) position but with +1 apple/length uncertainty. From (1,8), RIGHT toward x=2-9 to intercept central apples or (9,8) if enemy lags (e.g., if they UP twice to cluster but I can reach laterally). Monitor for enemy aggression toward x=0 (unlikely); if they RIGHT hard, pull back left from y=9. Avoid crowding right cluster yet\u2014let enemy cluster, flank from top or left.\n\nUP",

No longer backed into corner by own body\u2014DOWN into (0,8) would die, but tail is at (0,7), so body occupies (0,8) and (0,7).\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1)**: Head at (7,6), Body: [(7,5), (7,4)] (length 3). Apples: 2. Also grew to 3 segments, likely by eating an apple (possibly at (7,5) or similar, based on last rationale's prediction). Positioned mid-right, heading toward central apples; Manhattan distance to me is still far (~7-8 steps), no immediate threat for head-on or blocking.\n- **Apples**: Remaining: (8,7), (9,8), (7,7), (1,8), (6,5). The cluster at (7,7) and (8,7) is ~4-5 moves away for me (diagonal-ish via x-y increases); enemy is closer (~1-2 moves? From (7,6) to (7,7) is UP, trivial). (1,8) is at (1,8), row 8 pos1 is A, so y=8, x=1\u2014about 1 DOWN +1 RIGHT from current head, but current move is from (0,9).\n- **Board obstacles**: Top row (y=9) limits UP (y=10 off-board); left wall (x=0); own body blocks direct DOWN. Enemy is far, no risk of them reaching x=0-1 this turn. Apple's at (1,8) might be eatable soon, but not this move.\n- **Safe moves**:\n  - UP: To (0,10), off-board, dies.\n  - DOWN: To (0,8), into own body segment, dies (even if tail, it's occupied).\n  - LEFT: To (-1,9), off-board, dies.\n  - RIGHT: To (1,9), empty cell (confirmed by board: row9 pos1 is '.', no snake or apple there). Safe, avoids immediate death.\n- **Other risks**: No head-on possible (enemy moving RIGHT several times wouldn't reach, and they'd likely eye apples). No other snakes. Both at 2 apples, but game is early (turn 8/150), need to tip score.\n- **Growth/Options**: RIGHT moves to (1,9), opening horizontal space. From there, next turn: RIGHT to (2,9) or LEFT back to (0,9 but body blocks), or DOWN to (1,8)\u2014directly onto apple at (1,8)! Yes, (1,8) is an apple (board shows row8 pos1 as A). So RIGHT this turn, then IMMEDIATE DOWN to (1,8) eats that apple, gaining my 3rd apple (to 3) vs enemy 2, increasing lead. Enemy might eat one from cluster this turn (e.g., vertical move to apple), but this secures a point. Post-eat, from (1,8), options open: RIGHT to (2,8) for exploration, DOWN to (1,7) safe, etc. Avoids trapping self; enemy is mid-board, I can flank left/top if they overcommit to x=7-9 cluster.

Eating an apple here brings me to 3 apples, closing the gap (they have 4).\n- **Risks and options**: Staying at y=9 edges upward; DOWN opens vertical space (e.g., can continue down to y=7-6 later). Avoid clustering near myself; enemy could flank left toward (6,5) or (3,8) if I delay. No tight spaces yet, but priority is apple proximity and escape routes.\n\n### Plan for Next Few Turns\nMove DOWN to (2,8) for central y=8 position, then prioritize eating either (1,8) or (3,8) next turn (whichever enemy doesn't block). Post-eat, shift left/down toward (6,5) or (0,3) if enemy pursues, while maintaining 3-4 safe moves per turn. Stay 4-6 cells from enemy to avoid head-ons or kills; use horizontals for flanking.

DOWN from (3, 8) brings me closer to pathways for these (e.g., to (6, 5) via right and down) while RIGHT keeps options open near y=8 but slightly farther from lower apples like (0, 3).\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n  - UP to (3, 9): Open, but results in only one safe follow-up move (RIGHT), trapping me near the top edge\u2014poor long-term options.\n  - LEFT to (2, 8): Into own body\u2014die.\n  - RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe, 3 follow-up directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).

They can only go UP to (6,9), DOWN to (6,7), or LEFT to (5,8). DOWN to (6,7) would collide head-on with my possible RIGHT move, likely suicidal for them since I have fewer apples (3 vs. 5); if both die, they win by points. They'll probably go LEFT to contest the left apples like (1,8), per prior behavior.\n- **Apples**: Closest reachable are (6,5) via continuing RIGHT/DOWN paths, with limited competition on the right side.

Risks entangling with enemy in less controlled territory.\n  - DOWN to (5,6): Safe, positions closer to (6,5) indirectly and opens paths toward lower apples; follow-ups include RIGHT (6,6), DOWN, or LEFT (opens multiple options, avoiding self-traps).

This move limits future options to LEFT or DOWN, potentially trapping me. No apples nearby, and it doesn't help reach any apple quickly.\n   - DOWN: (5, 7) is open space. The enemy's head is at (6, 7), and their possible moves include LEFT to (5, 7). If both move to (5, 7), it would be a head-on collision, killing both. This is risky.\n   - LEFT: (4, 8) is open space. This move keeps future options open (UP to (4, 9), DOWN to (4, 7), or further LEFT to (3, 8)). The apple at (6, 5) is still reachable, and this move avoids the enemy's likely path toward (5, 7).

Blocked by own body at LEFT ((5,7)), and enemy body at UP ((6,8)). Safe moves: DOWN to (6,6) or RIGHT to (7,7). No immediate death risks from board edge or enemy bodies in these directions.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1)**: Head at (5,8), body [(6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7)], length 6. Can go UP to (5,9) or LEFT to (4,8). Predicted to go LEFT to pursue (1,8) apple, as it's a multi-step path and aligns with prior behavior; UP is less strategic as it moves away from apples and offers limited follow-ups (only DOWN or RIGHT from (5,9), with RIGHT risking board edge at (6,9) if continued). No likely head-on collisions with my safe moves\u2014DOWN leads to uncontested cells, RIGHT avoids their probable LEFT path.\n- **Apples**: Closest reachable is (6,5), directly accessible via DOWN path: (6,7) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (6,5) for a quick 2-turn eat, increasing apples to 4 (still trailing enemy's 5). Other apples like (7,3) or (7,1) are farther (~4-3 extra turns from RIGHT start, plus navigation), and lower ones like (0,3) would require detouring LEFT (blocked) or looping, exposing me to enemy pursuit. (1,8) is contested if enemy pursues LEFT.\n- **Safe Moves Evaluation**:\n  - DOWN to (6,6): Keeps maximum future options (DOWN again, RIGHT to (7,6), or LEFT to (5,6) if needed post-growth); directly advances toward safer apple with low risk\u2014enemy's likely LEFT doesn't intersect. High mobility preserved.\n  - RIGHT to (7,7): Also safe, but reduces options sooner (DOWN to (7,6), RIGHT to (8,7), UP blocked by enemy); detours slightly from (6,5) and commits to right side, potentially trapping against board edges if contested later. Less efficient for near apple.\n- **Strategic Choice**: Choose DOWN to follow last plan (advancing to (6,6) en route to (6,5)), secure rapid apple growth without overcommitting to contested areas, and maintain broad escape routes. Prioritizes safety and growth over minor shortcuts.\n\n### Plan for Next Few Turns\nExecute DOWN: (6,7) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (6,5), eat apple, now length 5, apples to 4. From (6,5), head DOWN to (6,4) for flexibility or RIGHT to (7,5) if enemy pressures (to pursue (7,3)\u2014DOWN path to (7,4)\u2192(7,3), then (7,2)\u2192(7,1) for double eat). Monitor enemy: if they stay near (0-6,8), pivot LEFT-loop via (5,5) or lower board for (0,3); if they aggressive block RIGHT, revert to circling around lower left for remote apples, avoiding north entirely.\n\nDOWN",
