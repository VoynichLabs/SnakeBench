That\u2019s risky.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApple at (3,4) is adjacent LEFT. Eating it would grow my snake to length 2.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nMoving LEFT to (3,4) risks collision if Snake #1 moves DOWN.  \nSnake #1 has 4 possible moves, so probability of it moving DOWN is 1/4, but the consequence is death.  \nSince I have no body yet, Snake #1 might not see me as a threat yet and could move randomly.\n\n**Alternative safe moves:**\nUP (4,5) \u2013 safe, but moves away from apple.  \nDOWN (4,3) \u2013 safe, but moves away from apple.  \nRIGHT (5,4) \u2013 safe, but moves away from apple.\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\n- If I don\u2019t take the apple now, Snake #1 might take it next turn if it moves DOWN to (3,4).\n- If I move LEFT and Snake #1 moves DOWN, we both die. But if Snake #1 moves elsewhere, I get the apple safely.\n- Since we both start with no body, maybe Snake #1 will avoid moving into my head\u2019s possible next positions? But Snake #1 doesn\u2019t know my move beforehand.\n\n**Better approach:**\nI can move UP to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,4) to avoid the risk entirely, but then I lose the apple opportunity.  \nAlternatively, I could move DOWN to (4,3) and next turn go to (3,3) then (3,4) to get the apple from below, avoiding head-on risk this turn.\n\nBut moving DOWN gives Snake #1 a chance to eat the apple at (3,4) before me.\n\nGiven the rules, head-on collision only happens if both heads move into the same cell simultaneously. If I move LEFT to (3,4) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (3,4), we both die.  \nIf I move LEFT and Snake #1 moves elsewhere, I eat the apple and grow.\n\nSince the apple is valuable and the game is long, maybe take the risk? But the objective says: \"never choose a move that obviously kills you\" \u2014 this is not certain death, but it is possible death. \"Obviously kills you\" means guaranteed death, but this is probabilistic.\n\nActually, \"obviously kills you\" means if there's any scenario where the move is safe, it's not \"obviously\" deadly. But since simultaneous moves are unknown, we must consider all enemy possible moves \u2014 if any enemy move could cause my death, that move is dangerous.\n\nGiven Snake #1 could move DOWN, LEFT is dangerous. But is it \"obviously\" deadly? No, because Snake #1 might not move DOWN.\n\nStill, early in the game, it\u2019s better to avoid 25% chance of death for one apple.\n\n**Best safe move that also progresses toward apple:**  \nMove DOWN to (4,3), then next turn LEFT to (3,3), then UP to (3,4) to get apple safely, avoiding head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter eating first apple, aim for apple at (1,1) or (0,5), avoiding Snake #1. Keep body length short to maintain mobility.\n\n**Final decision:**  \nAvoid risk, go DOWN this turn.\n\nDOWN",

If I move RIGHT to (8, 7), I'll be well above the enemy and in a strong position. The enemy might be heading toward the apple at (8, 1) or (6, 0), so I should secure the high-value apple at (9, 7) while I have the chance.\n\nRIGHT seems like the best choice - it immediately positions me adjacent to the apple at (9, 7) and keeps me away from the enemy snake's path.\n\n**Short-term plan:** After moving RIGHT to (8, 7), I'll be in position to collect (9, 7) on the next turn if I move RIGHT again, or I can continue UP/DOWN as needed.

I need to secure (8, 1) immediately.\n\n4. **Future mobility**:\n   - Moving DOWN to (8, 2) positions me to collect (8, 1) next turn\n   - After collecting (8, 1), I'll have good access to (9, 1) and potentially (6, 0)\n   - Moving LEFT or RIGHT would delay reaching the closest apple\n\n**Decision**: DOWN is the optimal move to immediately secure the closest apple at (8, 1) on the next turn.\n\n**Next turn plan**: After moving DOWN to (8, 2), I'll continue DOWN to (8, 1) to collect the apple.
