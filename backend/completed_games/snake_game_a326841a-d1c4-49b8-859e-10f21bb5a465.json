This is a safe move and does not immediately threaten any future growth. The snake is currently at the bottom-left corner, so moving up opens up more space for future growth.\n- **DOWN**: Moves the snake down to (1, 2). This is also safe, but it is adjacent to the enemy head at (3, 2). If the enemy moves toward the snake, there is a risk of collision.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves the snake to (1, 2), which is adjacent to the enemy head at (3, 2). This is also safe but similarly risky.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- **Avoid immediate threats**: Since the enemy is at (3, 2), moving directly adjacent to it (down or right) could lead to a collision if the enemy moves toward you.\n- **Expand horizontally**: Moving up to (0, 3) is safer and opens up more space. This move does not immediately threaten the enemy and allows the snake to grow toward apples that are more distant and less likely to be targeted by the enemy.\n\n### Immediate Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (9, 2), which is far away. The snake should focus on expanding its territory and avoiding immediate threats.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most strategic move is to **UP**.\n\nUP",

The enemy's head is at (2,3), and moving UP moves away from potential collision paths (enemy would need to move diagonally to reach you, which is less likely).\n  - No immediate risk of hitting own body (no tail yet).\n  - Moving UP opens vertical space for future growth toward apples like (5,3) and (6,3), which are in the top-right quadrant.\n\n- **DOWN/RIGHT** are adjacent to the enemy's potential movement. The enemy could move toward (1,4) or (0,4) in the next turn, increasing collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Prioritize vertical expansion (UP/DOWN)** to avoid enemy encroachment. The enemy is currently at (2,3), and moving UP will keep you away from their direct line of sight or potential movement.\n- **Watch for enemy movement patterns**: If the enemy moves toward (0,3) or (0,4) in the next turn, pivot away. For now, UP is the safest.\n- **Target apples in the top-right quadrant** (e.g., (9,2), (5,3), (6,3)) for long-term growth.

This keeps you away from the enemy\u2019s direct line of movement and opens access to apples like (5,3) and (6,3) in future turns.\n   - Avoid moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT**\u2014both risk collision with the enemy if they move toward you. The enemy\u2019s head is at (2,3), and moving toward (1,4) or (0,4) could lead to a head-on next turn.\n\n2. **Short-Term Expansion (Turns 5\u201310):**\n   - After eating an apple (if any), **grow vertically** (e.g., UP or DOWN) to create space and avoid the enemy\u2019s expansion. The enemy has no body yet, so they\u2019ll likely try to grow toward you.\n   - Watch for the apple at **(5,3)**\u2014it\u2019s close to your current head (0,5) if you move **UP** repeatedly. Once you reach it, prioritize eating it to gain points and extend your body.\n\n3. **Enemy Threat Mitigation:**\n   - If the enemy moves **UP** (to (2,5)), you should **DOWN** to stay away. If they move **DOWN** (to (3,3)), you should **UP** to avoid collision.\n   - Monitor their head position\u2014if they\u2019re moving toward your potential path, pivot away immediately.\n\n4. **Apple Prioritization:**\n   - **Top-right quadrant (y=5\u20139):** (9,2), (5,3), (6,3) are high-value targets. (9,2) is far but rewarding; (5,3) and (6,3) are closer and safer to reach with vertical growth.\n   - Avoid apples in the enemy\u2019s path (e.g., (1,8) is safe but may not be reachable quickly).\n\n5. **Risk Management:**\n   - Never move **LEFT**\u2014it\u2019s off-board and unsafe. If you must avoid the enemy, **UP** or **DOWN** are safer.\n   - If the enemy grows (Turn 2+), their body will block certain paths.

If the enemy moves **UP** next turn, they could collide with your head at `(0, 5)`. This is risky if the enemy grows aggressively.\n\n3. **LEFT:**\n   - New head position: `(-1, 6)` (off-board).\n   - **Dead move.**\n\n4. **RIGHT:**\n   - New head position: `(1, 6)`.\n   - The enemy is at `(1, 4)`, so moving to `(1, 6)` could place your head in their potential path if they grow toward you.\n   - **Risky** (enemy could block or collide).\n\n**Conclusion:** Only **UP** and **DOWN** are safe. Between them, **UP** is preferable because:\n- The enemy\u2019s head is at `(1, 4)`, which is **below** your current position. If they grow **UP** (toward `(2, 4)`), they won\u2019t immediately threaten your `(0, 7)`.\n- Moving **UP** expands your vertical space, making it harder for the enemy to corner you later.\n- The apple at `(5, 3)` is reachable via **UP** in future turns (e.g., `(0, 7) \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 ...` or similar).\n\n#### **Apple Prioritization**\n- The closest apples are `(9, 2)` (far) and `(5, 3)`/`(6, 3)` (closer but require vertical growth).\n- **UP** keeps you aligned with the `(5, 3)` apple\u2019s potential path (e.g., `(0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 ...`).\n- Avoiding **DOWN** or **RIGHT** prevents immediate threats from the enemy.\n\n#### **Enemy Threat Assessment**\n- The enemy has no body yet, so they\u2019ll likely grow **UP** or **DOWN** next turn.\n- If they grow **UP** to `(2, 4)`, your `(0, 7)` is safe.\n- If they grow **DOWN** to `(2, 3)`, your `(0, 7)` is still safe (no overlap).\n\n#### **Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Turns 5\u201310)**\n1. **Immediate Goal (Turn 5):**\n   - Move **UP** to `(0, 7)` (current decision).\n   - Next turn, consider **UP** again to `(0, 8)` to extend vertically and avoid the enemy\u2019s potential path.\n\n2. **Short-Term Expansion (Turns 6\u20138):**\n   - If no apples are eaten yet, prioritize **UP** to `(0, 9)` to create space.\n   - Watch for the enemy\u2019s head. If they move **UP** to `(2, 5)`, pivot **DOWN** to `(0, 8)` to avoid collision.\n\n3. **Apple Targeting:**\n   - Once you reach `(0, 9)`, consider **RIGHT** to `(1, 9)` to explore the top-right quadrant (apple at `(9, 2)` is far but high-value).\n   - If the enemy grows, monitor their head. If they move toward `(1, 9)`, avoid that path.\n\n4. **Risk Management:**\n   - Never move **LEFT** (off-board).\n   - If the enemy grows, their body will block certain paths. Track their head and body positions to avoid collisions.\n\n---\n**Final Decision:** UP",

If the enemy grows **UP** next turn, they could collide with your head at `(0, 8)` if they move toward you.\n   - **Risky** if the enemy grows aggressively.\n\n3. **LEFT:**\n   - New head: `(-1, 9)` \u2192 **Off-board** \u2192 Dead move.\n\n4. **RIGHT:**\n   - New head: `(1, 9)` \u2192 Valid.\n   - Enemy is at `(3, 5)`, so moving to `(1, 9)` is safe in terms of immediate threats.\n   - This opens a path toward `(9, 2)` (long-term goal) and `(1, 8)` (if it persists).\n\n**Conclusion:** Only **RIGHT** is **guaranteed safe** without immediate threats. Moving **RIGHT** to `(1, 9)` expands your horizontal space and keeps future options open.\n\n---\n\n### **Apple Prioritization**\n- The closest apple is now `(1, 8)`, but it\u2019s unreachable from `(0, 9)`.\n- The next closest is `(4, 5)`, `(5, 3)`, or `(6, 3)`, but these are farther away.\n- The **long-term goal** is `(9, 2)`, which is reachable by moving **RIGHT** to `(1, 9)` and then **DOWN** to `(1, 8)`, `(2, 8)`, ..., `(9, 8)`, and finally **DOWN** to `(9, 2)`.\n- Moving **RIGHT** now keeps you aligned for this path.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat Assessment**\n- The enemy has no body yet, so they\u2019ll likely grow **UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT** next turn.\n- If they grow **UP** to `(3, 6)`, your `(1, 9)` is still safe.\n- If they grow **DOWN** to `(3, 4)`, your `(1, 9)` remains safe.\n- If they grow **LEFT** or **RIGHT**, they won\u2019t immediately collide with you.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan (Turns 8\u201312)**\n1. **Immediate Goal (Turn 8):**\n   - Move **RIGHT** to `(1, 9)` (current decision).\n   - Next turn, consider **DOWN** to `(1, 8)` to start moving toward `(9, 2)`.\n\n2. **Short-Term Expansion (Turns 9\u201311):**\n   - If `(1, 8)` is eaten, prioritize **DOWN** to `(2, 8)` to reach `(9, 2)`.\n   - Watch the enemy\u2019s head. If they move toward `(1, 9)` or `(0, 9)`, pivot **DOWN** to `(1, 8)` to avoid collision.\n\n3. **Apple Targeting:**\n   - Once you reach `(2, 8)`, explore **DOWN** to `(2, 7)` to reach `(4, 5)` or `(5, 3)` if needed.\n   - If the enemy grows, monitor their head. If they move toward `(1, 9)`, avoid that path.\n\n4. **Risk Management:**\n   - Avoid **UP** or **LEFT** if the enemy is aggressive (off-board).\n   - Avoid **DOWN** if the enemy is moving toward you.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nRIGHT",

If it grows downward, it will occupy `(4, 6)` next turn, which could block your path to `(9, 2)`.\n2. **Your Safety:**\n   - **UP:** `(1, 8)` \u2192 Collides with tail `(1, 9)`? No, but `(1, 8)` is adjacent to tail `(1, 9)`\u2014if you move UP, your head would be at `(1, 8)` and tail at `(1, 9)`, which is safe (no immediate collision). However, the tail is at `(1, 9)`, so moving UP would place your head at `(1, 8)`, which is adjacent but not overlapping. Wait, no: the tail is at `(1, 9)`, so moving UP would place your head at `(1, 7)` (not `(1, 8)`). Wait, let's clarify:\n     - Current head: `(2, 8)`.\n     - Body: `[(1, 9)]` (tail).\n     - If you move UP, head moves to `(2, 7)` (not `(1, 8)`).

Body is `[(1, 9)]`. Let's re-evaluate:\n   - **UP:** `(1, 8)` \u2192 Safe (no body at `(1, 8)`).\n   - **DOWN:** `(3, 8)` \u2192 Safe.\n   - **LEFT:** `(2, 7)` \u2192 Safe.\n   - **RIGHT:** `(2, 9)` \u2192 Off-board (dead).\n\n   **Apple Proximity:**\n   - `(9, 2)` is still far, but your path is open.\n   - `(4, 5)` is reachable if you pivot, but `(9, 2)` is the ultimate goal.\n\n**Enemy Strategy:**\n- Snake #0 is growing downward. If it reaches `(4, 6)` or `(4, 7)`, it could block your path to `(9, 2)`.\n- Your best moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- **UP:** `(1, 8)` \u2192 Safe (no body).\n- **DOWN:** `(3, 8)` \u2192 Safe.\n- **LEFT:** `(2, 7)` \u2192 Safe.\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\n- `(9, 2)` is the highest priority.
