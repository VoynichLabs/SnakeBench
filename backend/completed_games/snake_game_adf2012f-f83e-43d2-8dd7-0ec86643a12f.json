LEFT to (2, 5): Moves toward (1, 9) apple which is uncontested.\n\nI'm currently leading 3-2 in apples. The enemy likely just ate an apple at (5, 6), potentially tying us at 3-3.\n\nGoing UP gives me flexibility - I can then decide to go LEFT toward (1, 9) or continue RIGHT toward (5, 9). It keeps multiple paths open.\n\nGoing LEFT starts me toward the uncontested apple at (1, 9), which is a safe play.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Target apple at (1, 9) since it's uncontested - go LEFT then UP\n- After (1, 9), can go for (5, 9) \n- Avoid competing directly with enemy for (6, 7)\n- Currently likely tied 3-3, need to maintain safe apple collection\n- Watch enemy movements - they'll likely go for (6, 7)\n\nI'll go UP to maintain flexibility and position myself to access either (1, 9) via LEFT or other apples going RIGHT.\n\nUP",

But enemy is about to eat the apple at (6, 7), likely tying us at 3-3.\n\nStrategic evaluation:\n1. Apple at (6, 7) - enemy will likely get it this turn (1 move away vs my 4)\n2.

Apple at (7, 1) - far, but uncontested\n\nBest strategy: Go for uncontested apples. The apple at (1, 9) is a good target - I need to go LEFT and then UP. Alternatively, (5, 9) could be reached going UP first.\n\nChecking future mobility:\n- UP to (3, 7): Can then go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Good flexibility.\n- LEFT to (2, 6): Can then go UP, LEFT, or DOWN (but DOWN leads back toward body area). \n- RIGHT to (4, 6): Can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Gets closer to contested areas.\n\nGoing UP positions me well to choose between (1, 9) going left or (5, 9) going right. It also keeps me away from the enemy who is likely moving toward (6, 7).\n\nGoing LEFT starts the path toward (1, 9) more directly.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Target the apple at (1, 9) - it's uncontested\n- Current path: Go LEFT to (2, 6), then continue LEFT to (1, 6), then UP toward (1, 9)\n- After (1, 9), can go for (5, 9)\n- Enemy will likely get (6, 7) this turn, but I can secure (1, 9) safely\n- Avoid head-on collision risks by staying away from enemy's likely path\n\nI'll go LEFT to start my journey toward (1, 9), which is uncontested.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN seems slightly more direct since I can collect (7, 1) on my next turn, and I'm also closer to (2, 2) apple later.\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully, going DOWN now and then RIGHT twice gets me both apples efficiently.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**\nAfter going DOWN to (6, 1), go RIGHT to (7, 1) for an apple, then RIGHT to (8, 1) for another.

DEADLY\n\n**Analyzing each move:**\n\n**UP to (7, 4):**\n- Empty space on the board\n- No body parts there\n- Safe move\n- Moves toward (6, 6) apple\n\n**DOWN to (7, 2):**\n- Empty space\n- Safe move\n- But moves away from apples\n\n**LEFT to (6, 3):**\n- Empty space\n- Safe move\n- Could work toward (2, 2) apple area\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n- My own body - DEADLY, eliminate this option\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\n- Enemy at (6, 7) can move to (5, 7), (7, 7), or DOWN to (6, 6)\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (6, 6), they get the apple I'm targeting\n- Enemy might also go for (7, 8) by moving RIGHT to (7, 7)\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm leading 9-8\n- Apple at (6, 6) is 3 squares away from me (7,3) -> (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (6,5) or (7,6) -> (6,6)\n- Actually, UP to (7, 4), then UP to (7, 5), then UP to (7, 6), then LEFT to (6, 6) = 4 moves\n- Enemy at (6, 7) can reach (6, 6) in just 1 move (DOWN)!\n\nEnemy will likely take (6, 6) before me. Let me reconsider.\n\nBetter to go for (2, 2) which is closer:\nFrom (7, 3) going LEFT:\n- (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) = 5 moves\n- But my body is currently blocking some paths\n\nActually, looking at the board, going UP toward (6, 6) is still reasonable even if enemy gets it - I need to avoid enemy collision.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6, 6), and I go UP to (7, 4), we don't collide.\n\nGoing UP gives me:\n- Safe move\n- Path toward center/upper area\n- Avoids my body\n- Keeps options open\n\nGoing LEFT to (6, 3) also safe, but UP seems to give better positioning toward multiple apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Continue UP toward the center-upper area\n- Watch enemy movements\n- After enemy situation clears, target remaining apples\n- Stay safe and maintain lead\n\nUP",
