Moving here collects my 5th apple and grows my snake.

This is clearly superior because:\n- I gain 1 apple (5th apple total)\n- My snake grows by 1 segment\n- The apple is directly in front of me at no risk\n- After collecting, I'll have more options to move toward the remaining apples\n\n**RIGHT (1, 3):** This moves away from the nearby apple and doesn't advance my scoring.\n\nThe choice is unambiguous: **UP** to collect the apple at (0, 4).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 4) - collect apple #5, snake becomes 6 cells long\n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 5) - continue upward to get out of the left edge\n3.
