This is excellent - closest apple, grows my snake, earns a point.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 6)**: Safe move, but moves away from the apple cluster. Still ok if needed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 7)**: Safe move, but not optimal since no immediate apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 7)**: Safe move, would position me closer to the (6, 8) apple cluster.\n\n## Strategy\n\nUP is clearly the best move - it collects an immediate apple, growing my snake from size 1 to size 2.

I don't see any immediate dangers from the enemy snake, who is quite far away at (1, 3) and has their own nearby apple (2, 1) to potentially target.\n\n**Note to future self:** After collecting the apple at (3, 8), I'll be at size 2. Consider then moving toward the apple cluster at (6, 8) or (9, 5), but always prioritize survival over greedy apple chasing. Watch for the enemy snake's movement patterns.\n\nUP",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2013 inside board, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 3) \u2013 inside board, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2013 inside board, safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe right now because I have no body yet, so no self-collision possible, and enemy is far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and possible collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 7). Possible moves for enemy: UP (3, 8) \u2013 apple there, DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7), RIGHT (4, 7).  \nWe move simultaneously, so I must avoid moving into a cell where enemy head might move into same cell as me (head-on collision).  \n\nCheck each of my moves:  \n\n1. **UP to (1, 4)** \u2013 enemy could move to (1, 4)? No, enemy is at (3, 7), can\u2019t reach (1, 4) in one move. Safe from head-on.  \n2. **DOWN to (1, 2)** \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach in one move. Safe.  \n3. **LEFT to (0, 3)** \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach in one move. Safe.  \n4. **RIGHT to (2, 3)** \u2013 enemy could move LEFT twice? No, only one move. Enemy at (3, 7) \u2192 LEFT is (2, 7), not (2, 3). So safe.  \n\nSo no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (2, 1) \u2013 distance |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3  \n- (4, 0) \u2013 distance 3 + 3 = 6  \n- Others are far.  \n\nBest to go toward (2, 1) if possible. From (1, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 away from (2, 1)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 2) \u2013 distance to (2, 1) becomes 1 + 1 = 2  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 3) \u2013 distance to (2, 1) becomes 2 + 2 = 4  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2013 distance to (2, 1) becomes 0 + 2 = 2  \n\nSo DOWN or RIGHT both get me closer to (2, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 3):  \nNext turn, possible moves from (2, 3) \u2013 UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2), LEFT (1, 3), RIGHT (3, 3). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2):  \nNext turn moves \u2013 UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2).  \n\nBoth seem fine, but DOWN gets me closer to apple (2, 1) in y-axis, and next turn I can go RIGHT to (2, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1) then RIGHT to (2, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nPlan: Go for closest apple (2, 1) first, avoid enemy until longer. Keep space open, maybe go down toward bottom apples first, then sweep up. Enemy is top half, so bottom apples safer early.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

One move away\n- (6, 8) - Same row, 2 spaces to the right\n- (9, 5) - Southeast\n- (2, 1) - Southwest\n- (4, 0) - Far south\n\n**Enemy snake (ID 0):**\n- Head at (2, 2), no body\n- Moving toward (2, 1) apple most likely\n- Still far from my position at (4, 8)\n\n## Evaluating possible moves from (4, 8):\n\n1. **UP to (4, 9)**: Safe move, edge of board but not trapping myself yet. Would move away from nearby apples though.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 7)**: **APPLE MOVE!** This collects the apple at (4, 7), grows my snake, and scores a point. Safe move - just need to verify no collision issues.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8)**: This would move into my own body! Moving backwards into the cell directly behind my head - **MUST ELIMINATE**.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 8)**: Safe move, positions me toward (6, 8) apple. Good alternative if DOWN has issues.\n\n## Checking DOWN move for safety:\n- Moving to (4, 7) - this is an apple cell\n- No snakes currently at (4, 7)\n- Enemy snake at (2, 2) is far away\n- Safe from all collision rules\n\n## Strategy\n\nLEFT is eliminated (moving backwards into my own body). Among the safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), DOWN is clearly optimal because:\n- It collects an apple immediately at (4, 7)\n- Grows my snake to size 3\n- Increases my score to 2 apples\n- Puts me in good position - from (4, 7) I can then go RIGHT to target (6, 8) or (9, 5)\n- The move is perfectly safe with no collision risk\n\nUP and RIGHT are safe but don't collect apples immediately. DOWN gives me immediate reward and maintains good positioning.\n\n**Note to future self:** After collecting (4, 7), I'll be at (4, 7) with size 3. From there, target (6, 8) or (9, 5). The enemy snake will likely get (2, 1). Watch for their movement pattern - they're still small and not a threat yet. Keep collecting apples and growing while maintaining safe distance.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN (3, -1) off board. LEFT (2, 0) safe. RIGHT (4, 0) safe (apple there). So only 2 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nFrom (4, 1): body becomes [(4, 1), (3, 1)].

But moves away from both apples.\n\n## Immediate opportunities:\n\nPerfect situation! Both apples are at distance 1:\n- (6, 8) is just UP from my current position (6, 7)\n- (6, 6) is just DOWN from my current position (6, 7)\n\nBoth moves would collect an apple, grow my snake, and increase my score to 3 apples.\n\n## Strategy\n\nLEFT is eliminated (moving backward into my own body). Among the remaining moves:\n\n- **RIGHT** to (7, 7): Safe but moves away from both apples, wasting this excellent opportunity\n- **UP** to (6, 8): Safe, collects an apple, grows to size 4\n- **DOWN** to (6, 6): Safe, collects an apple, grows to size 4\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are excellent moves that immediately collect an apple. This is the perfect tactical position I planned for last turn!\n\nChoosing **UP** over DOWN because:\n- It moves me to the top half of the board where there's slightly more open space\n- (6, 8) is the most northern apple currently available, positioning me well for future exploration\n- The enemy snake is at (4, 1) in the south, so moving north creates more distance from the opponent\n\n**Note to future self:** After collecting (6, 8), I'll be at size 4 with head at (6, 8). From there, I can consider moving toward other apples like (9, 5) to the east or (0, 4) to the west. The enemy snake is still at (4, 1) with only 1 apple - maintain the lead by collecting apples efficiently.\n\nUP",

Eating (4, 0) is safe this turn and grows me to length 3, which gives more body to block enemy later. Even with only 2 moves next turn, both LEFT (3, 0) and RIGHT (5, 0) are safe and keep me alive. I can plan to move away from the bottom edge next turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away and might go for (6, 6) or (6, 8), so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (4, 0), body: head (4, 0), body segments (4, 1), (3, 1).  \nNext turn avoid UP (body) and DOWN (off board). Choose LEFT to (3, 0) or RIGHT to (5, 0) based on apple proximity and enemy position. Aim toward (0, 4) or (6, 6) depending on safety. Keep an eye on enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT eats the nearest apple, grows to length 4 (score 3), closing gap with enemy (score 3). Eating now is better than delaying because enemy could later take it. UP keeps more options but misses immediate score gain. Since RIGHT is safe and gives an apple, I choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 0), if apple at (7, 0) was eaten (it will be), then next turn avoid DOWN (off board) and LEFT (body). Choose UP to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (8, 0) depending on which is safer after checking enemy\u2019s new position. Monitor enemy head for possible collision risks.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is currently smaller (size 4 vs my size 5) so I have an advantage.\n\nMoving DOWN positions me well to reach (6, 3) while keeping options open for other apples afterward. LEFT would take me on a longer journey toward (1, 6), and UP heads away from the closest apple opportunities.\n\n**DOWN** is the optimal choice - it keeps me on track for the nearby (6, 3) apple while avoiding any immediate collision risks with the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake at (8, 2) would need at least 4 moves to reach this apple (LEFT 2, DOWN 2), so I'm guaranteed to get there first.\n\nThe risk assessment shows DOWN is safe - no body collisions, no board boundaries, and no enemy threats since enemy is far away at (8, 2).\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is far away in the east and cannot reach these apples before me.\n\nThis western apple cluster is my golden opportunity to pull ahead in the race. Collecting (0, 4) now and (0, 5) next turn will give me a 2-apple lead over the enemy.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**\n- After collecting (0, 4), move UP to (0, 5) to collect that apple\n- Then consider moving toward (1, 6) or (5, 7) depending on enemy position\n- Maintain edge hugging for safety while collecting these easy apples\n\nUP",

Puts me equidistant to (1, 6) and (5, 7).\n\n## Strategy and Move Selection\n\nExcellent! I just collected the apple at (0, 5) and now lead 7-6. I need to maintain momentum and continue collecting apples safely.\n\n**Considering my next target:**\n- (1, 6) is the closest apple and can be reached in 2 moves\n- From (0, 5), both UP and RIGHT put me on track to reach (1, 6) efficiently\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) gives me more future options - I can then go UP to (1, 6) or continue eastward\n- UP to (0, 6) is also good, but (0, 6) has fewer exit options (cannot go further up if needed, and going right is still needed for the apple)\n\n**RIGHT** gives me the most flexibility. From (1, 5), I can go UP to (1, 6) for the apple, or continue RIGHT if needed. This keeps me away from the northern boundary and gives me more safe continuation options.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\n- After RIGHT to (1, 5), move UP to (1, 6) to collect that apple\n- Then assess whether to continue toward (5, 7) or (6, 9)\n- Maintain safe positioning, avoid trapping myself\n- Watch enemy's movement patterns from the east\n\nRIGHT",

Growing first helps.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP limits next moves (only 2 safe).  \nDOWN limits next moves (2 safe) and moves away from apples.  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward center, and sets up for apple (6, 9) next turn.  \nChoose LEFT for flexibility and apple access.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 8), strongly consider UP to (6, 9) to eat apple unless enemy threatens that cell. Check enemy\u2019s new head position after its move. If (6, 9) is contested, maybe go DOWN or LEFT instead to avoid head-on. Keep path toward (5, 7) open afterward.\n\nLEFT",

Would move toward (9, 3).\n\n## Strategy\n\nNow that I have a 2-apple lead (10 vs 8), I need to maintain this advantage while staying safe. The enemy is at (5, 6), so moving RIGHT to (4, 6) brings me closer to them. However, the distance is safe - we'd need 2 moves to potentially collide.\n\n**Comparing safe moves:**\n\n- **UP to (3, 7)**: Opens up access to the northern apples (1, 9) and potentially (9, 9). Puts some distance between me and the enemy.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 6)**: Moves toward (9, 3) but also closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy's body extends north and east from (5, 6), so moving UP keeps me well clear of their territory while opening up more options. Moving RIGHT puts me in a potential collision course.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\n- Move UP to (3, 7) to maintain safe distance from enemy and position for northern apples\n- This keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available (could continue north to (3, 8) or move east from (4, 7) later)\n- With a 2-apple lead, prioritize staying safe over aggressive apple hunting\n- The northern region has fewer obstructions and more open space to maneuver\n\n**UP** is the safer choice that maintains flexibility and moves toward the less contested northern apples.\n\n**Future self advice:**\nAfter moving UP, consider continuing north toward (1, 9) or eventually circling toward (9, 9). Avoid getting too close to the enemy at (5, 6) - maintain at least 2-3 cell buffer. With the lead, focus on survival and gradual apple collection rather than risky maneuvers.\n\nUP",

It can go UP (3, 7) toward (1, 9) apple, or RIGHT (4, 6) toward center. If it goes RIGHT, and I go LEFT, we collide at (4, 6).  \nSince I\u2019m behind in apples (8 vs 10), I should avoid risky head-on.  \nLEFT is only safe if enemy goes UP.  \nDOWN or RIGHT avoid possible head-on.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is safest:  \n- No head-on risk (enemy not moving to (5, 5)).  \n- Leaves 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Moves toward (6, 1) apple area.  \n- Avoids left side where enemy may expand.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 5), consider moving toward (6, 1) via DOWN or RIGHT next, while watching enemy\u2019s new position. Enemy may have eaten (1, 9) apple and grown longer, blocking top-left. Right side apples (9, 3), (9, 9) are reachable later via safe path along bottom-right.\n\nDOWN",

The apple at (1, 9) is still accessible from this position.\n\n**UP** is the better choice because:\n- The apple at (1, 9) is only 3 moves away and appears uncontested\n- It puts maximum distance between me and the enemy snake (5, 4)\n- It opens up more future options in the northern territory\n- With my lead, I should focus on collecting safer apples in less contested areas\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nMove UP toward (1, 9), which is the closest apple and in relatively safe territory. After collecting (1, 9), I'll have 11 apples and can consider moving toward (9, 9) or (0, 6) depending on the board state. Continue building my lead while avoiding the enemy.\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (9, 3), (6, 1), (1, 9), (9, 9), (0, 6)  \n\nFrom (5, 4):  \n- (6, 1): Manhattan distance 4 (right 1, down 3).  \n- (9, 3): distance 5 (right 4, down 1).  \n- (0, 6): distance 6 (left 5, up 2).  \n- (1, 9): distance 7 (left 4, up 5).  \n- (9, 9): distance 9 (right 4, up 5).  \n\nClosest is (6, 1).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (5, 3):  \nBody: head (5, 3), then (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), tail (6, 8).  \nNext turn from (5, 3):  \n- UP (5, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN (5, 2) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (4, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n3 safe moves.

Keep checking enemy\u2019s position \u2014 it\u2019s going top-left for (1, 9) or (0, 6). Bottom right area (apples at (9, 3), (9, 9)) could be my next targets after (6, 1).  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s acceptable.  \n\nBest choice: RIGHT to eat apple and stay competitive.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 3), after eating apple, my tail will stay at (5, 5) for one more turn (growth delay). Next turn, avoid moving LEFT into (8, 3) (my body). Prefer UP to (9, 4) or DOWN to (9, 2) to keep space. Watch enemy movement toward my area.  \n\nRIGHT",

Goal: work toward (6, 5) apple while avoiding boxing myself in. Enemy is far left, so central area is safe for now.\n\nLEFT",

Looking at the board state:\n- Row 5: \"A . 1 . . . A . . .\"\n- My head (1) is at (2, 5)\n- (3, 5) appears to be empty (marked as \".\")\n\nActually, **RIGHT to (3, 5)** is safe! This opens up a path toward the apple at (6, 5).\n\n## Strategy\n\nFrom (2, 5), I have **THREE** safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. This is much better than last turn!\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n\n- **LEFT to (1, 5)**: Moves me toward the nearest apple at (0, 5). This is very tempting as it's only 2 moves away and would extend my lead. However, after eating it, I'd be at (0, 5) with limited escape routes (surrounded by my own body on the north side).\n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: Moves me toward the apple at (6, 5). This is 4 spaces away and keeps me in more open territory. This seems like the safer long-term option.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 4)**: Moves me away from all apples into open space, but doesn't help me collect apples or extend my lead.\n\n**Decision**: I should choose between LEFT and RIGHT based on apple collection strategy.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (9, 4), they are quite far away and would need many turns to reach any of these apples. I have time to maneuver safely.\n\n**LEFT to (1, 5)** is the most aggressive move - going for the closest apple. This will extend my lead to +3 apples. From (1, 5), I can then go LEFT again to (0, 5) to eat the apple, then potentially continue west or south to escape.\n\n**Short-term plan**: Go LEFT toward the nearest apple at (0, 5). This maintains my lead and the enemy is too far away to interfere. After collecting it, I'll need to navigate carefully to avoid getting trapped, but the western side has more open space.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s far from my possible moves (8, 6), (7, 5), (9, 5).

UP is safe but delays apple.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 5), go LEFT to (6, 5) to eat apple unless enemy suddenly appears near (6, 5) \u2014 unlikely. Then after eating, move UP to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 5) to avoid boxing in.\n\nLEFT",

From (2, 2), I can go to (2, 1) then (2, 0) to collect the apple. This is slightly more direct and keeps me in a better central position.\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 2)**: Moves me away from the apple and into a more confined area.\n\n**Priority**: **RIGHT** is strategically best because:\n1. It's the most direct route to the closest apple (2, 0) - from (2, 2), I'm just 2 moves away following the path (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (2, 0)\n2. It positions me more centrally, opening up future options\n3. After collecting (2, 0), I'll have good access to either continue south or head toward other apples\n4. The enemy snake is far away at (6, 7), so central positioning is safe\n\n**Safety check**: All three non-UP moves are safe. Enemy snake is on the east side and doesn't threaten immediate collision.\n\n**Next turn plan**: Continue toward (2, 0) apple, either RIGHT\u2192DOWN or DOWN\u2192RIGHT depending on position.\n\nRIGHT",

(empty)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 **no**  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy collision risk this turn**  \nEnemy head: (4, 4)  \nEnemy possible moves from (4, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 enemy body (T) \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 '.'  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible heads: (4, 5), (4, 3), (5, 4).  \nMy possible heads: (1, 8), (1, 6), (0, 7). No overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (9, 9), (7, 2), (7, 7), (6, 0), (0, 6)  \n\nFrom (1, 7):  \n- UP (1, 8): closest apple is (0, 6) distance 3 steps, (7, 7) distance 6 steps.  \n- DOWN (1, 6): closest apple is (0, 6) distance 2 steps, (7, 7) distance 5 steps.  \n- LEFT (0, 7): closest apple is (0, 6) distance 1 step, (7, 7) distance 7 steps.  \n\nLEFT is closest to (0, 6), but DOWN also close.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf UP to (1, 8):  \nNext turn from (1, 8):  \n- UP (1, 9) \u2192 '.'  \n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 my body (now at (2, 7) but after move my body shifts, so (1, 7) will be my neck) \u2192 actually after moving UP, my old head (1, 7) becomes body, so (1, 7) is occupied next turn. So DOWN into (1, 7) \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT (0, 8) \u2192 '.'  \n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 '.'  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 6):  \nNext turn from (1, 6):  \n- UP (1, 7) \u2192 body (old head) \u2192 no  \n- DOWN (1, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT (0, 6) \u2192 apple (0, 6) \u2192 safe (eating apple grows, so tail stays)  \n- RIGHT (2, 6) \u2192 board shows 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 no  \nSo safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nIf LEFT to (0, 7):  \nNext turn from (0, 7):  \n- UP (0, 8) \u2192 '.'  \n- DOWN (0, 6) \u2192 apple (0, 6) \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT (1, 7) \u2192 body \u2192 no  \nSo safe next moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple capture plan**  \nI\u2019m behind 13 vs 16 apples. (0, 6) is very close.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7), next turn I can go DOWN to (0, 6) and eat it.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 6), next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 6) and eat it.  \nBoth get apple in 2 moves.  \n\nBut: enemy at (4, 4) is 5 steps from (0, 6) via shortest path, so I can get there first either way.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of enemy cutting me off**  \nEnemy could move toward (7, 7) or (6, 0) or (7, 2). (0, 6) is relatively safe from enemy.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Space considerations**  \nMy snake is long (length 14). Going LEFT to (0, 7) puts me near left wall, reducing future flexibility. Going DOWN to (1, 6) keeps me more central.  \n\nBut DOWN to (1, 6) has only 2 safe follow-ups (DOWN, LEFT) next turn, and one of those (LEFT) is eating apple, which is fine. After eating apple, I grow, so my tail stays where it is, opening up more space behind eventually.  \n\nLEFT to (0, 7) also has 2 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN), but DOWN is eating apple.  \n\nActually, both are similar in steps to apple, but DOWN from (1, 7) to (1, 6) seems slightly safer because it doesn\u2019t hug the wall immediately, leaving more escape routes after eating apple.  \n\nLet\u2019s check board after eating apple at (0, 6):  \nIf I go DOWN now to (1, 6), then LEFT to (0, 6) next turn, after eating, my head at (0, 6), body extends back to (1, 6) etc. From (0, 6), possible moves: UP (0, 7) is body, DOWN (0, 5) is free, RIGHT (1, 6) is body. So only DOWN is safe unless I wait a turn. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nIf I go LEFT now to (0, 7), then DOWN to (0, 6) next turn, after eating, head at (0, 6), body extends back to (0, 7). Then from (0, 6), moves: UP (0, 7) body, DOWN (0, 5) free, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 6) free? Wait, (1, 6) will be free unless enemy moves there. Actually after eating, my body at (0, 7) and (1, 7) etc. So (1, 6) is free. So from (0, 6) after eating, safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. That\u2019s better than only DOWN.  \n\nSo LEFT now gives better escape after eating the apple.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT to (0, 7) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (0, 6) eat apple \u2192 then from (0, 6) can go DOWN or RIGHT. Safer post-apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 7), go DOWN to (0, 6) to eat apple, unless enemy suddenly threatens (0, 6) from (4, 4) in 1 turn (impossible). Then after eating, choose DOWN or RIGHT based on safety.  \n\nLEFT",

Actually (6, 5) is my body, so enemy would die if they go there, but they might not choose it.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 enemy body (T) \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 '.'  \n\nSo enemy possible heads: (6, 5), (6, 3), (7, 4)  \nMy possible heads: (0, 5), (1, 6)  \nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (9, 9), (7, 2), (7, 7), (6, 0), (9, 6)  \nFrom (0, 6):  \n- DOWN to (0, 5) \u2192 no apple.  \n- RIGHT to (1, 6) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nClosest apple to (0, 5) is (6, 0) or (7, 2).  \nClosest apple to (1, 6) is (7, 7) or (9, 6).  \n\nBoth moves don\u2019t get an apple immediately.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf DOWN to (0, 5):  \nNext turn from (0, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 enemy body (T) \u2192 no  \nSo only DOWN is safe next turn \u2192 dead end.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (1, 6):  \nNext turn from (1, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 no  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 '.'  \nSo only RIGHT is safe next turn \u2192 also dead end.  \n\nWait \u2014 check (1, 5) is enemy body? Yes, snake #1 body at (1, 5).  \nSo from (1, 6), only RIGHT is safe. That\u2019s also a trap.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Rethink: maybe I missed a safe move**  \nFrom (0, 6):  \nUP into body, LEFT off board, so only DOWN and RIGHT.  \nBoth lead to only 1 safe move next turn \u2192 dangerous.  \n\nBut maybe I can survive if I eat an apple soon? No apples reachable in 1 step.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves threatening my future positions**  \nEnemy at (6, 4) could go to (6, 3), (7, 4), or maybe (6, 5) if suicidal.  \nThey are far from me now, so not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Which is less trapping?**  \nDOWN to (0, 5) \u2192 only DOWN next turn to (0, 4) \u2192 then from (0, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 enemy body (T) \u2192 no  \nSo again only DOWN. This is a vertical corridor at left edge with enemy body blocking (1, 4) and (1, 5). I\u2019d be stuck going down until death.  \n\nRIGHT to (1, 6) \u2192 only RIGHT next turn to (2, 6) \u2192 from (2, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 '.'  \nSo at (2, 6), DOWN and RIGHT are safe. That\u2019s better!  \n\nSo RIGHT now gives me a future with 2 safe moves at (2, 6).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m behind 14 vs 16 apples. Need to survive and reach apples.  \nFrom (2, 6), I can go to (2, 5) or (3, 6).  \nApple at (7, 7) is reachable via moving right/up over time.  \nAvoid moving toward enemy head (6, 4) too soon.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), go RIGHT to (2, 6). Then assess.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check: enemy body list: [(7, 2), (7, 3), ...] so (7, 2) is its own body segment \u2192 no.  \n\nActually, enemy body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]  \nSo (7, 2) is its own body, so enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT.  \n\nEnemy possible heads: (6, 3), (6, 1), (5, 2)  \n\nMy possible heads: (4, 7), (4, 5), (5, 6)  \n\nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (9, 9), (7, 7), (6, 0), (9, 6), (2, 4)  \n\nFrom (4, 6):  \n- UP (4, 7): closer to (7, 7) and (9, 6)  \n- DOWN (4, 5): closer to (2, 4) and (6, 0)  \n- RIGHT (5, 6): closer to (7, 7) and (9, 6)  \n\nI\u2019m behind 14 vs 17 apples, need to catch up.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\nIf UP to (4, 7):  \nNext turn from (4, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 my old head (empty) \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 no  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 '.'  \n\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nIf DOWN to (4, 5):  \nNext turn from (4, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 old head (empty)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 enemy body (4, 4) \u2192 no  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5, 6):  \nNext turn from (5, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 '.'  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 '.'  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 old head (empty)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 '.'  \n\nAll 4 moves safe.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives most future options (4 safe moves), DOWN gives 3, UP gives only 2.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nUP to (4, 7) is risky because it reduces options next turn and puts me near my own body loop.  \nDOWN to (4, 5) gets me closer to (2, 4) but enemy body at (4, 4) blocks moving down further, and enemy head is at (6, 2) \u2014 could cut me off if I go toward (2, 4).  \nRIGHT to (5, 6) opens space toward apples (7, 7) and (9, 6) with more room to maneuver.  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away at (6, 2), so right side is safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nFrom (5, 6), I can go UP next to (5, 7) then right toward (7, 7), or go RIGHT to (6, 6) then up toward (9, 6).  \nThis keeps me away from enemy\u2019s long body and my own cluttered left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 6), check enemy\u2019s new head position, then likely go UP or RIGHT toward nearest apple while keeping options open.

All four directions appear to be blocked! Let me verify the board state more carefully.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n 0 . . T T 1 T T . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFrom (4, 0):\n- UP to (4, 1): blocked by my own body\n- DOWN: off board (y would be -1)\n- LEFT to (3, 0): blocked by my own body at (3, 0)\n- RIGHT to (5, 0): blocked by my own body at (5, 0)\n\nThis is a critical situation! All four directions are blocked or would kill me. However, let me reconsider - I need to think about whether any of these would actually result in immediate death.\n\nActually, let me re-examine the rules and the board state more carefully. Looking at my body coordinates:\n- My body segments near my head: (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)...\n\nAt position (4, 0), my neighboring cells are:\n- UP (4, 1): occupied by my body \u2713\n- DOWN (4, -1): off board \u2713\n- LEFT (3, 0): occupied by my body \u2713  \n- RIGHT (5, 0): occupied by my body \u2713\n\nAll four moves would indeed kill me! This is a dead end. However, I should consider if there's any possibility I'm misreading the situation. Let me think about whether moving into my own body from the previous position would actually cause death.\n\nThe rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So yes, all four directions would kill me.\n\n**This is a game-ending situation - I have no valid moves!** All moves lead to death. This means the game should end and my opponent would win by default if they have any valid moves.\n\nHowever, since I must provide a move, and there might be a slim chance I'm misunderstanding something, let me consider if there's any possible interpretation where one of these moves is valid. But according to the rules as stated, all four moves would kill me.\n\nGiven that I MUST choose a move, and the game rules don't provide for situations where all moves are invalid, I should choose the \"least bad\" option, but all options lead to immediate death.\n\nWait - let me reconsider the body coordinates. Maybe there's an error in my reading. Looking at the body again:\n- Head: (4, 0)\n- Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), ...]\n\nSo the cell at (4, 1) is definitely my body, and (5, 0) is definitely my body, and looking at the path, (3, 0) should also be my body based on the tail end of the list showing (2, 0).\n\nActually, I realize I might be misinterpreting the body list. Let me trace through it more carefully:\n- (4, 1): first body segment after head\n- (5, 1): second body segment\n- (5, 0): third body segment\n- (6, 0): fourth body segment\n\nSo (5, 0) is definitely occupied by my body. But wait, let me check (3, 0). Looking at the end of my body list: \"...(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)]\"\n\nYes, (3, 0) is also occupied by my body!\n\nUnfortunately, it appears all four directions from (4, 0) are indeed blocked:\n- UP to (4, 1): my body\n- LEFT to (3, 0): my body  \n- RIGHT to (5, 0): my body\n- DOWN to (4, -1): off board\n\nThis is a checkmate situation. Since I must provide a move, and all moves lead to death, I'll choose the move that doesn't involve going off the board immediately, which narrows it to UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nAmong these, UP to (4, 1) is moving \"forward\" along what would have been my path if I hadn't doubled back on myself. This seems like the most natural continuation, even though it will result in my death.\n\nUP",
