But Snake #2 may start to move towards the apple at (8, 6), so I need to get to the upper apples before it does. \n\nGiven this information, it would be best to start moving upwards towards the apple at (1, 6), making sure to still watch Snake #2's movements. \n\nNext move: UP."

Considering the enemy snakes' positions, I don't see any immediate threats.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to get closer to the apple at (1, 0) and then see if I can find any other apples or a way to block the enemy snakes.\n\nMy next move is: RIGHT"
