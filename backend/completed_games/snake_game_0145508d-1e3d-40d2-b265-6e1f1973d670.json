I need to make a move. My primary goal is to collect an apple without getting killed. I should look for a safe move that increases the probability of collecting an apple. The enemy snake is located on the right side of the board. It appears that my best bet is to move to (5,4) as that is where my tail ends and there\u2019s an apple at (5,4). I should also account for the fact that the enemy snake may move.\n\nLet's check the possible moves.\n\n*   **UP:** (3, 3) - Avoids hitting the enemy snake (8,6).\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 5) - Avoids hitting the enemy snake (8,6).\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 4) - Avoids hitting the enemy snake (8,6). Also, this is close to the apple at (2, 1).\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 4) - Avoids hitting the enemy snake (8,6). This also looks promising as an apple exists at (4,4).\n\nI will prioritize the move that allows me to potentially get closer to the apple at coordinate (4,4).\n\nI choose to move RIGHT.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT",

After the move, your body will occupy (8,7) -> (8,6).\n\n- DOWN -> (8,5): Safe, but no apple there. You\u2019d miss the immediate opportunity.\n\n- LEFT -> (7,6): Safe, but not an apple this turn.\n\n- RIGHT -> (9,6): Safe, but not an apple this turn.\n\nRationale: The easiest and safest way to gain points this turn is to eat the adjacent apple by moving UP. Other moves don\u2019t provide immediate reward and could complicate future spacing.\n\nPlan:\n- Short term: Eat the apple at (8,7) by moving UP this turn to gain 1 apple and grow.\n- After that, reassess the board: keep distance from walls, look for the next closest apple (likely (9,5) or (5,4)) while avoiding dead-ends. Maintain flexibility to avoid getting boxed in by the enemy.\n\nUP",

Since the enemy snake is on the right side of the board, it is more likely that it will move either down or right.

This will result in a stalemate; I will be in the same spot as before.\n- I won't reach any apple in this direction.\n\nMoving Down:\n- My head would move to (7, 5). This is a safe move.\n-  I'd be directly above the apple at (4, 4), but the apple is lower. Now that I'm facing a lower apple, my options are limited, making it hard to plan future moves.\n\nThe most straightforward and safe move is to move right to eat the apple. This gives me the highest immediate reward and maintains several future options.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT",

I currently occupy (7, 4) with my head at (9, 4) and a body segment at (8, 4). I have a good distance from the enemy. I see an apple at (4, 4).\n\nMy current situation is that I'm relatively close to the apple at (4, 4) but slightly to the right of it.

Alternatively, I can move right for a safer path directly to the apple.\n\nLet's consider the potential outcomes:\n*   **RIGHT:**  Moves my head to (8, 4), resulting in eating the apple. I move closer to the apple and maintain a good distance.  I'm also avoiding a likely collision with the enemy, which is based on a simplified assumption of the enemy's movement.\n*   **UP:** Moves my head to (7, 3). While it avoids a possible collision with the enemy, it\u2019s an unfavorable position. It would be better to go right and consume the apple.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves my head to (6, 4).  This is a dead end, and I cannot eat any apples.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves my head to (7, 5). It doesn't improve my situation and puts me directly above the apple, but also opens me up to direct confrontation with the enemy snake, which are both undesirable.\n\nTherefore, the most sensible move is to move right to obtain the apple.\n\nRIGHT",
