UP: Move to (2, 8)\n   - This is a safe position (not off board, not into my body)\n   - This is where the enemy snake's head is currently located\n   - If enemy moves RIGHT (which is likely given its current orientation), I could potentially get the apple at (2, 9) next turn\n   - Risky due to potential head-on collision\n\n2. DOWN: Move to (2, 6)\n   - This would move me back into my own body segment at (2, 6)\n   - This would kill me immediately\n   - NOT SAFE\n\n3. LEFT: Move to (1, 7)\n   - This is a safe position (not off board, not into my body, not into enemy body)\n   - No apple at this location\n   - This would move me away from the apples at (2, 9) and (3, 5)\n\n4. RIGHT: Move to (3, 7)\n   - This is a safe position (not off board, not into my body, not into enemy body)\n   - No apple at this location\n   - This would move me away from the apples at (2, 9) and (3, 5)\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (2, 8) directly above me, with its body extending to the right along row y=8. If I move UP to (2, 8), and the enemy snake moves RIGHT to (3, 8) (which is likely), then I would be at (2, 8) and the enemy at (3, 8) - this is safe and not a head-on collision. Then next turn I could move UP to (2, 9) and potentially get that apple.\n\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from the nearby apples at (2, 9) and (3, 5). Given the enemy's position and orientation, moving UP is the most strategic move to potentially access the apple at (2, 9).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving up, I should continue moving up to reach the apple at (2, 9) if the enemy moves away. I need to be aware of the enemy's movements and be ready to adjust my strategy if the enemy doesn't move as expected.UP<|end_of_box|>",
