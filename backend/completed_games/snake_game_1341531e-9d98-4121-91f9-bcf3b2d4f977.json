Moving DOWN to (1, 0) gets me an apple immediately - this is the clear best choice\n2. The enemy snake is at (2, 0) but since I'm going to (1, 0), there's no collision risk\n3. After getting the apple, I'll need to plan my next move carefully to avoid getting trapped\n\n## Decision:\nI'll move DOWN to (1, 0) to collect the apple. This will make my snake grow by 1.\n\n## Next Turn Strategy:\nAfter collecting the apple at (1, 0), I'll have limited options. The enemy snake will be to my right, and I can't go back up since my body will be there. I should plan to move LEFT to (0, 0) and then start working my way up the left edge of the board toward the apple at (0, 8). This gives me a clear path away from the enemy snake and toward another apple.\n\nDOWN"
