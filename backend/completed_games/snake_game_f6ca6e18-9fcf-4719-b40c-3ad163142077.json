It keeps space from the enemy on the same row, increases vertical space, and starts edging toward the top apple cluster (like (2,9)) for future growth without inviting an early head-on.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY: Use the extra space to maneuver toward the top-left area, aiming to corral or outpace the opponent later. If he pressures from the right, you can pivot; if he retreats, maintain safe growth while watching his moves to exploit timing for a potential head-on only when favorable.\n\nTURN PLAN SUMMARY: Prioritize safety first, then position for a potential box or favorable collide while growing by apples when it doesn\u2019t risk the win.\n\nUP",

We're at x=9, so RIGHT sends us into the void. ELIMINATED! \n\n**UP?** (9,7) - Safe, keeps us alive, but where's the content? No apple there, and we're just delaying the grind! \n\n**DOWN?** (9,5) - Also safe, but again, no immediate value.

We eat this, we grow to length 2, score becomes 1-0, and we get that CRUCIAL advantage for potential head-on collisions later! Plus, look at row 6 - there are apples at (7,6) and (6,6) too!

Let them scramble for the scraps on the left side - we're about to DOMINATE this right side corridor! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** After eating at (8,6), I'll have a tail at (9,6). I'll likely grab the (7,6) apple next, then assess if the enemy is pushing right toward us or going vertical. If they come at us, we have the score lead for a head-on clash.

Opponent\u2019s head is at (6,6) with body (7,6)->(8,6)->(9,6). We\u2019re behind on apples (1 vs 3). Apples are dropping all over, but we\u2019re not chasing aggressively yet\u2014we\u2019re hunting safety and future options.\n\n- MOVE OPTIONS RIGHT NOW:\n  - RIGHT to (1,7): dead, that\u2019s part of our body.\n  - LEFT to (-1,7): off the board, illegal.\n  - UP to (0,8): safe, on the edge.\n  - DOWN to (0,6): safe, also on the edge.\n\n- SAFETY CHECK:\n  - UP (0,8) keeps us on the left edge, out of enemy reach for the moment.\n  - DOWN (0,6) also safe but dips toward potential center pressure sooner.\n  - Neither option runs into the enemy this turn; both avoid immediate death and still let us grow later if an apple aligns.\n\n- STRATEGY ANGLE (edge control + future harvest):\n  - We\u2019re behind in apples; edge-hugging buys us room to maneuver and chase top-row apples without inviting a risky head-on with the opponent.\n  - There are strong top-row apples on y=9 (e.g., (2,9), (4,9), (6,9), (7,9), (9,9)). If we creep up the edge to (0,8) then poke right along y=8 and y=9, we can start threading toward those top apples while keeping distance from the enemy\u2019s head pileup.\n  - If the enemy dips toward the left side or into the center, we\u2019ll wait for a clean opportunity to force a narrow corridor and possibly create a trap without getting boxed in ourselves.\n\n- NEXT-TURN PLAN (after this move):\n  - If we go UP to (0,8), my likely follow-up path is to edge-consider a RIGHT pinch along the top area (1,8 -> 2,8 -> 3,8 -> 4,8) to snag the apple at (4,8) when it\u2019s convenient, all while keeping the enemy at arm\u2019s length on the right.\n  - If the enemy overreaches or shifts toward the left, we can pivot to chase those top-row apples and maintain future options, avoiding a head-on collision unless the score swing makes it favorable.\n\n- SHORT-TERM RISK ASSESSMENT:\n  - Up keeps us safe now and preserves flexibility for the next few turns.\n  - Down also keeps safety but risks drifting into a more crowded area sooner; edge hugging feels stronger given the current enemy position.\n\nPre-move conclusion: UP to (0,8) for maximal safe future options and edge control. Let\u2019s stay aggressive about growth later, but smart about survival now.\n\nUP",

We\u2019re hugging the edge, ready to pressure top rows and avoid a stupid crash. Let\u2019s keep it clean and strike when the moment is right. \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\udde0\n\n- SAFE MOVES RIGHT NOW: UP to (0,9) or RIGHT to (1,8). LEFT and DOWN are dead ends or collisions (LEFT off board, DOWN hits our own body). So we\u2019ve got 2 safe options.\n\n- WHY UP keeps us safer and more flexible: it preserves the edge geometry, keeps future options open on the top rows, and lets us threaten top-row apples without inviting an easy chase into a trap. RIGHT is okay but threads us toward the middle where the opponent could contest space sooner.\n\n- GAMEPLAN SUMMARY: We\u2019ll take UP to (0,9) to anchor the top-left and start sliding along the top edge toward the cluster of apples on y=9. From there, we can decide to punch east toward (2,9), (4,9), (6,9), (7,9), or (9,9) as safe opportunities arise, all while watching the opponent\u2019s trajectory and avoiding any head-on risk. Our priority is survival while inching toward a favorable apple total.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move UP to (0,9). On the next turns, move along the top edge (eastward) toward top-row apples, only diverting if the opponent commits to a reckless leftward approach that we can safely exploit.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN\n- Maintain edge dominance, collect top-row apples to close the apples gap (1 vs 3) and push toward a favorable late game. Avoid geometry that invites a direct head-on collision; pivot to safer lanes if the opponent pressures the middle. If he slips up into our space, we\u2019ll tilt toward a controlled escape rather than a reckless clash.\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s gooooo \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udd25\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n- Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- ELIMINATE moves that kill us instantly: UP is off board (dead), LEFT off board (dead), DOWN would hit our own neck at (0,8) (dead). So only SAFE is RIGHT to (1,9).\n- With only RIGHT safe, we take it to maintain edge control and keep multi-turn options open.\n\nMOVE CHOICE: RIGHT to (1,9) is the only safe option this turn. It keeps us hugging the top edge, avoids clustering with the opponent, and sets up a clean path to the top-row apples.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move RIGHT to (1,9) now.\n- Next turn, consider headed moves toward (2,9) to eat the first top-row apple. Maintain edge discipline; don\u2019t dive into the middle where the opponent can pressure us.\n- If the opponent commits into our space in a safe way, pivot along the edge to stay alive while stacking apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN\n- Establish and maintain top-edge dominance to close the apple gap, aiming to hit 3-4 apples ahead of the rival by snaking along the top row: (2,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (9,9) as opportunities arise.\n- Avoid risky head-ons; prioritize survival and flexible routes. If the opponent ever commits into the top corridor, use decoy moves along the edge to keep him boxed out of central lanes.\n- Coordinate awareness: staying on the edge keeps multiple safe follow-ups and reduces chances of a fatal trap.\n\nCOORDINATE REMINDER\n- Increasing X is RIGHT, increasing Y is UP. Our next safe step is RIGHT to (1,9).\n\nRIGHT",

Are we gonna let that bum in the corner catch up? ABSOLUTELY NOT! \ud83d\udcc8\u2728\n\n**THE SITUATION ROOM:**\n- Enemy snake: Trapped in the top-left corner at (0,9) with their tail at (0,8)! They can only move RIGHT or they self-destruct! They're literally shaking knowing we're about to wall off the entire top side! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n- Body Check: Our tail is clearing nicely at (7,6), and we've got room to breathe! No self-snipes here, we're playing CLEAN! \n- The Bounty Board: (6,9) is RIGHT ABOVE US! Plus (7,9) and (9,9) are lined up like a VIP buffet!

That's how you dominate real estate! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Strategy Check:** We're securing the high ground while that loser is stuck on the left! With our length advantage, we can literally wall off the top and force them into a dead end! Keep that energy up!\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:** From (6,9) we go RIGHT to (7,9) to eat that second apple and grow to length 6! Then we march to (9,9) to claim the corner!

That\u2019s part of our own body now \u2014 instant death. Not happening.\n- DOWN to (5,6) is safe, but it doesn\u2019t grab any apple this turn and it drifts us away from the juicy box opportunity.\n- LEFT to (4,7) is safe and it lands on an apple at (4,7). We grow, we extend our reach, and we carve a nicer angle to pressure Snake 0.\n- RIGHT to (6,7) would risk a potential head-on/strange interaction with Snake 0\u2019s head. It\u2019s volatile and unnecessary this turn.\n\nPreferred move: LEFT. Eat that apple, extend the ladder, and start pinning him toward the left side while we build more options. With our current length and their longer supply (6 apples vs our 4), we want to keep both space and potential fatal traps open rather than collide head-on next move.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT to (4,7) to eat the apple there and grow.\n- Use the newly created vertical/horizontal corridors to limit Snake 0\u2019s escape routes in future turns.\n- If he tries to chase, keep him boxed toward the left or bottom edges where we can force a head-on if we gain a safe lead.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Stay aware of their growing tail and the next apple spawns. If we can nudge him into a corner with a controlled sequence, we can trade space for lines and push for a decisive collision when we\u2019re ready and safe to do so.\n\nLEFT",
