The board is 10x10, so I need to avoid walls\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n- Closest apple is at (4, 5), which is directly above the enemy snake\n- Need to move cautiously to avoid the enemy snake\n- Want to move towards an apple for points\n- (4, 5) seems like a good target\n\nPotential Risk Analysis:\n- Moving UP puts me close to the enemy snake\n- Moving RIGHT seems clear and gives a path to the (4, 5) apple\n\nThinking out loud: I want to approach the (4, 5) apple carefully while avoiding collision.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
