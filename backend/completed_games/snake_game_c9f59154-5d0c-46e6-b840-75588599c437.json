No obstacles.\n- **DOWN (3,6)**: Safe. No obstacles.\n- **LEFT (2,7)**: Safe. No obstacles.\n- **RIGHT (4,7)**: Safe. No obstacles.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (6,7) is at the same y-level as me (y=7), 3 units to the right\n- (5,6) is 1 unit down and 2 units to the right\n- (2,3) and (1,3) are 4 units down and to the left\n\n### Movement Strategy\nI want to head toward the closest apple at (6,7). Since I'm at (3,7) and the apple is at (6,7), I should move RIGHT to get closer to it. This also maintains some distance from the enemy snake which is currently positioned above and to the left of me.\n\nRIGHT",
