This is a strong position as I'm on the same column as one of the apples. The enemy is at (3, 2), so moving up takes me closer to it, but there's space to maneuver.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moves toward (2, 8) apple. Takes me to column 2, moving away from the immediate enemy at (3, 2).\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moves toward (6, 4) and (9, 1)/(9, 0) apples. Opens up the right side of the board.\n\n**Best Strategy:**\nMoving UP is the strongest choice because:\n1. It takes me directly toward the closest apple at (3, 5)\n2. The apple is on the same x-coordinate, making a clear path\n3. I increase my score quickly early on\n4. The enemy snake at (3, 2) will move somewhere, and I have plenty of space to react\n5. Getting the first apple gives me a length advantage over the enemy\n\n**Long-term plan:** Focus on collecting the apple at (3, 5) by moving up. After that, pivot toward either (2, 8) on the left or the eastern apples at (9, 0), (9, 1), (6, 4) depending on the enemy snake's movements. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nUP",

However, there's an excellent opportunity here: the apple at (2, 8) is directly above me. Moving UP will:\n1. **Secure my first apple** - this is critical as I'm currently 0-2 in the apple score\n2. **Grow my snake** - having a body will give me more strategic flexibility\n3. **Maintain efficiency** - I've been tracking toward this apple and can collect it now\n\nThe enemy snake at (7, 4) is nowhere near this apple or my trajectory. No collision threats.\n\n**Next Turn Plan:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (2, 8), I'll grow to length 2. I should then assess the board:\n- Closest apples after (2, 8): (7, 7) is relatively far at distance ~6-7 moves\n- Alternative targets: (4, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1) - the bottom-right cluster\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake's movements for collision avoidance\n- Once I have a body, be more cautious about tight spaces\n\nUP",

The question is which is more efficient. Looking at the geometry: from (4, 1):\n- UP to (4, 2), then RIGHT to (5, 2), then UP to (5, 3) = 3 moves\n- RIGHT to (5, 1), then UP to (5, 2), then UP to (5, 3) = 3 moves\n\nThey're equally efficient. UP maintains slightly better flexibility in case of unexpected situations, and continuing the upward momentum toward the upper apples makes sense strategically.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** Target the apple at (5, 3) in the next few turns. After collecting it, work toward the apples at (5, 8) and (0, 8) in the upper section. Avoid the right side of the board where the enemy snake is stronger.

Check if (0, 6) is safe - it's not in the new body configuration after movement. Actually, I need to think about this differently. The tail moves away when I move, so (0, 6) would be safe IF the tail is no longer there.\n\nActually, looking at position (1, 6) in the body list - that's where the old tail is. After I move, that position will be vacated. So UP to (0, 6) should be safe.\n\nLet me verify safe moves more carefully:\n- UP to (0, 6): Not in my current body (after tail moves away) ✓, not in enemy body ✓\n- DOWN to (0, 4): In my current body ✗\n- LEFT: Out of bounds ✗\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): In my current body ✗\n\n**Safe Moves:** Only UP is safe.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nUP to (0, 6):\n- Gets me closer to the apple cluster at (3, 7)\n- My enemy is at (4, 7), very close to apples\n- I'm at 12 apples, enemy at 9\n- Need to reach 30 first\n- Moving UP continues my northward trajectory toward (3, 7)\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (0, 6), I should prepare to move RIGHT toward (3, 7). The enemy snake at (4, 7) is nearby, but I have one more apple in reach at (3, 7). Need to navigate carefully and ensure I don't collide with enemy head on subsequent moves.

Continuing RIGHT keeps me on the shortest path to collect it. The enemy snake #0 is at (5, 8), likely moving left or staying in the middle area, so there's no immediate collision risk. I have a clear 5-move path: (2,8) → (3,8) → (6,8) → (7,8) to collect the apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue moving RIGHT along row 8 to reach and collect the apple at (7, 8).
