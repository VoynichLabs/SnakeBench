Wait, the initial position is at (1,6); after the last move, moving DOWN, the new position should be at (1,7). \n\nActually, the last move was \"DOWN,\" and our position was at (1,8)\u2014probably a mistake. Let's double-check:\n\n- Initial position: (1,6)\n- Moved DOWN -> (1,7)\n- Then moved DOWN again -> (1,8)\n\nYes, in the current scenario, we're at (1,8), having moved down twice from (1,6), so we are at (1,8).\n\nNext, the closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly below us, five steps away. Moving further down seems logical as it brings us closer to the apple at (1,3).\n\n- Walls: the bottom boundary is at y=0, so moving down further is still safe.\n- No obstacles or enemy snakes blocking directly below us in the next moves, assuming we proceed cautiously.\n- Moving left or right is less direct toward the target apple unless there's an obstacle, and moving UP isn't an option as we're already near the top boundary (at y=8).\n\nGiven our goal to reach the apple at (1,3), the best immediate move is to continue moving downward.\n\nNext, I need to consider potential traps: I must avoid moving into walls or into the enemy snake or into my own tail if grown\u2014since I currently have no body segments,  I only need to avoid walls and enemy snakes.\n\nBased on the current board:\n\n- The cell below at (1,7) is free?\n- (1,7): Confirmed open.\n- (1,8): current position.\n- (1,7): next move downward.\n- (1,6): last known position, now two steps above.\n\nSo, moving DOWN from (1,8) to (1,7) looks safe and keeps us aligned with the apple at (1,3).\n\nAdditionally, after reaching (1,3), I can plan to go directly toward the apple at (3,2), which is to the right and below, with minimal risk.\n\nTherefore, I decide on moving DOWN again.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",
