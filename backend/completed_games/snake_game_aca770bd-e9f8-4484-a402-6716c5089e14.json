No body (mine or enemy\u2019s) there. Enemy is at (7, 2) \u2192 moving left would be to (6, 2), not colliding with (0, 2). No head-on collision risk.  \n  After eating apple, I\u2019ll grow to length 2 with head at (0, 2) and tail at (0, 1). That\u2019s fine.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 1) \u2013 empty, safe?  \n  Not off board, no apple, no snake there, no immediate danger.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 0) \u2013 contains an apple, safe?  \n  Not off board, no snake there. Enemy not moving there. Good.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 1) \u2013 off board, invalid.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n**Which is best?**\n- UP gets apple immediately, grows to length 2.  \n- DOWN gets apple immediately, grows to length 2.  \n- RIGHT gets no apple, stays length 1.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN:  \n- UP to (0, 2): Next turn, possible moves from (0, 2) if length 2:  \n  Body at (0, 1), so can\u2019t go DOWN (backwards into body = death).  \n  Can go UP to (0, 3), RIGHT to (1, 2) (apple), LEFT invalid. So 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n- DOWN to (0, 0): Next turn, body at (0, 1), so can\u2019t go UP (backwards into body).  \n  Can go DOWN (off board \u2192 no), LEFT (off board \u2192 no), RIGHT to (1, 0) (apple). So only RIGHT is safe next turn. That\u2019s more limiting.\n\nSo UP gives more options next turn than DOWN.  \nRIGHT gives no apple now but more freedom next turn (from (1,1) can go in 3 directions except LEFT). But enemy is far away, so collecting apple early seems good.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat apple at (0, 2) to grow to length 2, then move toward (1, 2) apple or (0, 3) empty space to keep options open. Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Actually (2, 0) is closer to enemy\u2019s x=6? No, enemy at x=6, (2,0) is x=2, enemy would take at least 4 moves to get there, not immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term:**  \nEating apples quickly helps win before enemy. RIGHT gives immediate apple, increasing my length and score now. UP puts me closer to apples at (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6) cluster later.  \n\nBut RIGHT also moves me away from left wall where my tail is trapped along x=0. Staying near left wall limits future moves. Moving right opens board.  \n\nEnemy is at bottom right, so moving UP might keep me central and safer from enemy\u2019s path.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nTaking the immediate apple at (3, 2) seems strong. It grows me to length 4, enemy length is 3, I\u2019ll be longer. Also, eating apple removes it from board, denying enemy.  \n\nNext turn after RIGHT, I\u2019ll be at (3, 2) with options UP/DOWN/RIGHT, all safe. Could go UP toward (3, 4) apple after.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT and eating apple at (3, 2), consider moving UP toward (3, 4) apple cluster, but watch enemy movement. Enemy likely moving left toward apples at (4, 0), (3, 0), etc. Keep distance.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Also positions near cluster (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6).  \n- **DOWN to (3, 1)**: next turn from (3, 1): UP to (3, 2) body (death), DOWN to (3, 0) apple, LEFT to (2, 1) empty, RIGHT to (4, 1) apple \u2192 3 safe moves, two lead to apples. But enemy might move toward (4, 0) or (4, 1) soon.  \n- **RIGHT to (4, 2)**: next turn from (4, 2): UP to (4, 3) empty, DOWN to (4, 1) apple, LEFT to (3, 2) body (death), RIGHT to (5, 2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves, one leads to apple (4, 1).  \n\nAll three safe moves keep options open.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nMy tail is at (0, 2), so moving UP or RIGHT opens space. Enemy is bottom-right, so moving UP keeps distance. Apple at (3, 4) is close after UP move. Moving DOWN risks moving toward enemy's possible path to (4, 0), (3, 0).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (3, 3), next turn I can take apple at (3, 4) unless enemy interferes (unlikely this turn). That grows me to length 5, increasing lead.  \n\nRIGHT also good, but puts me closer to right side where enemy might go UP from (5, 0) to (5, 1), etc.  \n\nDOWN puts me near bottom apples but also near enemy's possible moves.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives immediate path to apple next turn while staying central and away from enemy's likely leftward move toward (4, 0).  \n\nUP  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes.  \n   - Into my own body? No. My body: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2) \u2014 not there.  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy body: (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0) \u2014 not there.  \n   - Apple at (3, 5)? No (apples list: (3, 6) yes, (3, 5) no).  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 3)  \n   - On board? Yes.  \n   - Into my own body? Yes! My body\u2019s first segment after head is (3, 3) \u2192 would hit myself.  \n   - Eliminated.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 4)  \n   - On board? Yes.  \n   - Into my own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Apple at (2, 4)? Yes, apple present \u2192 would eat it and grow.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 4)  \n   - On board? Yes.  \n   - Into my own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Apple at (4, 4)? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions**  \n\nEnemy head at (2, 1). Possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 2)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 0)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 1)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1)  \n\nMy possible moves: UP (3, 5), LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4).  \n\nHead-on collision happens if we move into the same cell simultaneously.  \n- If I go LEFT to (2, 4), enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 4) in one move from (2, 1). Safe.  \n- If I go UP to (3, 5), enemy can\u2019t reach (3, 5) in one move. Safe.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 4), enemy can\u2019t reach (4, 4) in one move. Safe.  \n\nNo direct head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Future move safety after each choice**  \n\nFrom (3, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) apple, safe next? Check: body won\u2019t be there yet, enemy unlikely to reach.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) apple, safe? Possibly.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) apple, safe? Possibly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) currently empty but my old head position \u2014 next turn my body will be at (3, 4), so DOWN from (3, 5) next turn would hit myself unless I eat apple and tail moves? Wait, if I don\u2019t eat apple now, my tail stays at (3, 2) next turn, body: head(3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) \u2014 so DOWN from (3,5) goes to (3,4) which is occupied by my own body next turn, so DOWN not safe next turn unless I eat apple now to grow and shift tail? Actually, if I don\u2019t eat apple now, my length stays 5, tail moves forward, so (3,4) will be my neck, (3,5) head, (3,4) second segment, (3,3) third, etc. Yes, so DOWN into (3,4) would be suicide next turn. So from (3,5), only UP/LEFT/RIGHT might be safe next turn.  \n\nFrom (2, 4) after eating apple \u2192 length 6, body: new head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2). Possible moves next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,5) apple, safe?  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4) empty, safe?  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) empty, safe?  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) occupied by my body next turn (second segment), so not safe.  \n\nSo from (2,4), 3 safe directions next turn (UP, LEFT, DOWN).  \n\nFrom (4,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,5) apple, safe?  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,4) empty, safe?  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,3) my body next turn? Let\u2019s check: my body next turn if I go RIGHT now: head(4,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2). So (4,3) is my 4th segment, so DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3) would hit myself. So DOWN not safe next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,4) my second segment, so not safe.  \n\nSo from (4,4), only UP and RIGHT safe next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity**  \n\nLEFT (2,4) has apple immediately.  \nUP (3,5) no apple now, but closer to (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).  \nRIGHT (4,4) no apple now, but closer to (4,5).  \n\nImmediate apple gain is beneficial for score and length, but also for survival (tail follows later, more space).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Enemy threat**  \n\nEnemy at (2,1) could move UP to (2,2), then (2,3), etc., possibly toward apples at (2,4), but I\u2019d be at (2,4) this turn eating it, so he can\u2019t get there till I leave. He might move toward (4,1) apple, but that\u2019s far from me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Choose**  \n\nLEFT gives apple now, good growth, 3 safe moves next turn.  \nUP gives no apple now, but maybe safer distance from enemy? Actually enemy far away.  \n\nI think taking the apple at (2,4) is strong because:  \n1. Immediate score increase (5 vs 4 apples).  \n2. Length increases, which helps in potential head-to-head later.  \n3. Still keeps options open (3 directions next turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (2,4), consider moving to (2,5) apple next if safe, or (1,4) to explore left side apples. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if enemy moves toward (4,1), he\u2019ll be forced toward right wall after. Keep path open to cycle apples on left side. Avoid trapping near walls.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, tail is last segment (3,2), after moving without eating, tail leaves (3,2), new tail is (4,2)? Let\u2019s trace: current body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2).

Not in my body.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,3) empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,3) my 4th segment \u2014 suicide.  \nSo only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 4)** (no apple eaten, length stays 6):  \nBody next turn: head (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) \u2014 tail (4,2).  \n\nFrom (1,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,5) empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) my 2nd segment \u2014 suicide.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and score**  \n\nUP gives immediate apple, increases score to 6 vs enemy\u2019s 6 (they\u2019d tie score this turn unless they also eat one).  \nEnemy might eat apple at (0, 1) or (1, 0) or (0, 0) \u2014 they\u2019re near several apples.  \nEating apple now also gives me longer body, which helps in potential head-to-head later.  \n\nLEFT gives no apple now but opens path to left-side apples later.  \nDOWN gives no apple now and reduces future options (only 2 safe moves next turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Enemy movement threat**  \n\nEnemy at (1,1) could move UP to (1,2) toward (0,2) apple, or LEFT to (0,1) apple, or RIGHT to (2,1) empty. They are far from (2,5) or (1,4) or (2,3) right now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Decision**  \n\nUP gives apple, 3 safe moves next turn, good for score and length.  \nLEFT gives no apple but 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN gives no apple and fewer options next turn (2 moves).  \n\nBest choice: **UP** for immediate score gain and keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (2,5), consider moving to (2,6) apple or (1,5) to explore left side. Monitor enemy movement toward left-bottom apples \u2014 they might head toward (0,0) area. Keep space to avoid trapping near top wall later.  \n\nUP",

Avoid RIGHT into (2,6) (my body). Keep building length advantage and maintain escape routes. Watch enemy movement toward bottom-left apples.  \n\nLEFT",

Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 2) their own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 0) apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 1) their own body \u2192 suicide.  \n\nOnly safe move for enemy: DOWN to (0, 0).  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6).  \nEnemy\u2019s only safe cell: (0,0).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**\n\n**UP to (1, 7)** (eat apple, length 10):  \nBody next turn: head (1,7), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) \u2014 tail (3,2).  \nFrom (1,7):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) my 2nd segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) empty, safe.  \nSo only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn.\n\n**DOWN to (1, 5)** (no apple, length 9):  \nBody next turn: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) \u2014 tail (4,2).  \nFrom (1,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,6) my 2nd segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5) empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) my 4th segment \u2192 suicide.  \nSo only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn.\n\n**LEFT to (0, 6)** (no apple, length 9):  \nBody next turn: head (0,6), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) \u2014 tail (4,2).  \nFrom (0,6):  \n- UP \u2192 (0,7) empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,5) empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) my 2nd segment \u2192 suicide.  \nSo only UP and DOWN safe next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and score:**  \n\nUP gives apple, increasing my score to 9 vs enemy\u2019s 8 (enemy will eat apple at (0,0)).  \nDOWN and LEFT give no apple \u2192 enemy ties at 8 apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \n\nUP (1,7) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, trapped near top-left corner.  \nDOWN (1,5) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, but more central.  \nLEFT (0,6) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, trapped near left wall.  \n\nAll options leave me with 2 safe moves next turn. But UP gains an apple and keeps me ahead in score.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nScore advantage matters for win condition (most apples at end). UP gives apple and keeps lead. Trapping risk is similar for all moves, but I can try to escape corner next turn via LEFT or RIGHT from (1,7).  \n\nChoosing DOWN or LEFT gives no apple and enemy ties score. That\u2019s worse strategically.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll choose **UP** to eat apple at (1,7), go to length 10 vs enemy length 9, and deal with limited moves next turn by planning to go LEFT or RIGHT then.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,7) after eating apple, only LEFT (0,7) or RIGHT (2,7) are safe. Prefer direction that opens more moves afterward. Likely RIGHT (2,7) will be better than LEFT (0,7) to avoid left-edge trap.\n\nUP",

Closest: (0, 4) is 3 steps away vertically.  \nApples near (2, 7): (4, 7), (6, 6), (3, 6), (7, 7), (4, 5), (5, 5), (4, 4).

So enemy must go RIGHT to (2, 0) next turn. That means enemy will be in column 2 row 0 next turn, far from top rows.\n\nI should stay away from bottom rows for now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nBoth moves equally safe this turn, both leave one safe move next turn.  \nGoing RIGHT (2, 7) \u2192 next turn only RIGHT to (3, 7) \u2192 from (3, 7), maybe more options open?  \nFrom (3, 7): possible moves:  \nUP off board, DOWN (3, 6) apple?, LEFT (2, 7) body, RIGHT (4, 7) apple? Wait, need to check body then.  \n\nActually, from (3, 7) next turn: body will be: head (3, 7), then (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), tail (3, 2).  \nSo (3, 6) empty? Apples list: (3, 6) is apple. Not in my body then. DOWN to (3, 6) would be safe and eat apple. That\u2019s good.  \nRIGHT to (4, 7) also apple, also safe? (4, 7) not in body. So actually from (3, 7) I might have DOWN and RIGHT safe, not just one. Need to check carefully:  \nBody cells at that time: (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2).  \n(3, 6) not in list \u2192 safe.  \n(4, 7) not in list \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT (2, 7) is body \u2192 suicide. UP off board.  \nSo from (3, 7) next turn, I\u2019d have 2 safe moves (DOWN and RIGHT), both leading to apples. That\u2019s better than going LEFT now \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 only DOWN to (0, 6) next turn \u2192 from (0, 6) only DOWN to (0, 5) safe (since LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 6) body, UP (0, 7) body). That\u2019s worse.\n\nSo **RIGHT** now gives better options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7) \u2192 only RIGHT to (3, 7) safe. Then from (3, 7) choose between DOWN to (3, 6) apple or RIGHT to (4, 7) apple. Prefer whichever is safer regarding enemy position at that time.\n\nRIGHT",

That means if I survive this turn and next turn, I win immediately (all opponents dead).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Which move ensures I survive next turn?**  \n\nFrom (3, 6) next turn: safe moves DOWN to (3, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 6).  \nFrom (4, 7) next turn: safe moves DOWN to (4, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 7).  \n\nBoth give me a safe move next turn, so either is fine for surviving to see enemy die.  \n\nBut (3, 6) \u2192 (3, 5) next turn may be safer long-term because (3, 5) is closer to many apples (4, 5), (4, 4), etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nI prefer DOWN to (3, 6) apple to get off top row and be closer to middle apples. Enemy will die next turn regardless, so I just need to stay alive one more turn after this.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 6), choose DOWN to (3, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 6) depending on board state then, but likely DOWN to (3, 5) to go toward apple cluster at (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5), etc. Enemy will be dead after their move next turn, so focus on survival and apple collection.  \n\nDOWN",
