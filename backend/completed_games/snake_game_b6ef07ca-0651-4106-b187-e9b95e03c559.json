Moving DOWN gets me closer to these apples while keeping my options open - I can easily maneuver left or right as needed.\n\nThe apple at (1, 6) to my upper-left is relatively isolated and risky to pursue early. Better to secure the bottom apples first where there are multiple targets.\n\nSince both snakes are still small (just heads), there's minimal collision risk, so I should prioritize maximizing apple collection efficiency.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Move DOWN to approach the (4, 0) and (3, 0) apples cluster\n- Once I grab apples from the bottom, reposition to collect other scattered apples\n- Monitor enemy snake's movements to avoid head-on collisions as we both grow\n\nDOWN",

I'll collect my first apple and grow.\n   - No collisions with enemy snake\n   - Safe \u2713\n\n2. **UP** to (4, 2):\n   - Safe from collisions\n   - Moves away from nearest apple\n   - Safe but inefficient\n\n3. **LEFT** to (3, 1):\n   - Safe from collisions\n   - Moves away from nearest apple\n   - Safe but inefficient\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (5, 1):\n   - Safe from collisions\n   - Moves away from nearest apple\n   - Safe but inefficient\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nDOWN is clearly the optimal move. The apple at (4, 0) is directly below my current position, and moving DOWN will:\n1. Collect my first apple (gaining 1 point)\n2. Grow my snake to length 2\n3. Keep me alive (no collisions possible)\n4. Position me well for future moves\n\nThe enemy snake at (1, 0) with body at (2, 0) is not a threat for this move since I'm moving to (4, 0), which is far from their position.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (4, 0), I'll be at position (4, 0) with a tail at (4, 1). Next turn I should evaluate the remaining apples. The closest ones will likely be (6, 2) or (0, 2). I'll move to maximize apple collection while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

Looking at apple density, I should go RIGHT toward (6, 2) since it's a direct path upward, and I can also reach (9, 6) from that direction.\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps me in the lower portion of the board with good escape routes and positions me toward the eastern apples which are less contested.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5, 0), I should continue moving UP toward the apple at (6, 2).
