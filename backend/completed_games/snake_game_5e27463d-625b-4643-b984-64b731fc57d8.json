          "rationale": "**Analysis of current situation:**\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (1,2). Body: none. Apples: 0. I'm a single cell snake, so I have no risk of colliding with myself (except moving backwards, which doesn't apply since I have no body length). However, I must avoid enemy snake bodies and the enemy head.\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (8,2). Body: none. Apples: 0. Single cell snake. Potential for head-on collision if we move towards each other.\n- **Apples:** Many apples around. I should prioritize collecting apples while staying safe.\n- **Board constraints:** 10x10 grid, coordinates (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\n\n**Immediate move evaluation (Turn 0):**\nI need to choose one of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction for safety first.\n\n1. **UP:** From (1,2) to (1,3).\n   - Is (1,3) on the board? Yes (0-9).\n   - Is (1,3) occupied by my body? No, I have no body.\n   - Is (1,3) occupied by enemy body? Enemy snake #1 has no body, so no.\n   - Could this be a head-on collision? Enemy head is at (8,2). Enemy could move left to (7,2), right to (9,2), up to (8,3), or down to (8,1). None of those are (1,3). So no immediate head-on collision with enemy head. However, if enemy moves up-left in some pattern? But enemy is far away at (8,2). (1,3) is not a threat from enemy's perspective.\n   - Is there an apple? Let's check: Apples list: (7,8), (4,9), (0,3), (7,1), (0,5), (9,0), (7,4), (8,6), (5,5), (6,7), (6,9), (0,9), (1,8), (7,0), (7,9). None at (1,3). So moving UP does not eat an apple immediately.\n   - Future options: From (1,3), I can move in any direction (UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2) which is my current position but would be moving backwards into my own tail? Actually, since I have no body, moving DOWN to (1,2) would be moving into the cell my head just left? Wait, careful: After moving UP to (1,3), my previous position (1,2) becomes part of my body? Since I'm a single cell snake, after moving, my head will be at (1,3) and my body will be at (1,2) (one segment). So moving DOWN next turn would be moving back to (1,2), which is my body, and that would kill me. So from (1,3), the move DOWN would be suicide because it's moving into my own body. However, LEFT, RIGHT, and UP are safe (assuming no other obstacles). So moving UP keeps some options open but limits DOWN. Not terrible.\n\n2. **DOWN:** From (1,2) to (1,1).\n   - On board: Yes.\n   - My body: No (I have none).\n   - Enemy body: No.\n   - Head-on collision: Enemy head at (8,2) could potentially move? No, enemy would have to move all the way to (1,1) to collide, impossible in one turn.\n   - Apple? Check list: (1,8) is an apple, (1,1) is not. So no apple.\n   - Future options: From (1,1), moving UP would go to (1,2) which would be my body (since I moved from (1,2) to (1,1), (1,2) becomes body). So UP would be suicide. LEFT to (0,1), RIGHT to (2,1), DOWN to (1,0) are safe. So similar to UP, but different direction.\n\n3. **LEFT:** From (1,2) to (0,2).\n   - On board: Yes (x=0 is valid).\n   - My body: No.\n   - Enemy body: No.\n   - Head-on collision: Unlikely.\n   - Apple? Check: (0,3) is an apple, but (0,2) is not listed. So no immediate apple.\n   - Future options: From (0,2), RIGHT would go to (1,2) which is my body (since I moved from (1,2) to (0,2)), so RIGHT would be suicide. UP to (0,3) is an apple (and safe if no other threats). DOWN to (0,1), LEFT is invalid (off board, x=-1). So LEFT move gives access to an apple at (0,3) next turn via UP. That seems promising.\n\n4. **RIGHT:** From (1,2) to (2,2).\n   - On board: Yes.\n   - My body: No.\n   - Enemy body: No.\n   - Head-on collision: Unlikely.\n   - Apple? No apple at (2,2).\n   - Future options: From (2,2), LEFT would go to (1,2) which is my body -> suicide. UP to (2,3), DOWN to (2,1), RIGHT to (3,2) are safe. No immediate apple access.\n\n**Comparing moves:**\n- LEFT gives me immediate access to an apple at (0,3) on the next turn (by moving UP). This allows me to grow quickly.\n- UP and DOWN don't offer immediate apple access, and also limit future moves due to self-collision risk.\n- RIGHT also doesn't offer immediate apple access.\n\nBut I must consider the enemy snake. The enemy snake is at (8,2), single cell. It's far away, but if I move LEFT to (0,2), I'm moving towards the left edge. The enemy might be moving elsewhere. I should also consider if the enemy could threaten me. Since enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (1,2), we are on the same row (y=2). If I move LEFT to (0,2), and enemy moves RIGHT to (9,2), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT to (7,2), still far. If enemy moves UP to (8,3) or DOWN to (8,1), no issue. So no immediate collision risk.\n\nAlso, note that there are apples at (0,3), (0,5), (0,9). Moving LEFT gets me closer to these left-column apples.\n\nBut there's also an apple at (1,8) directly above my current position. If I move UP now to (1,3), I'm still far from (1,8). However, from (0,2) after LEFT, I can go UP to (0,3) (apple), then continue UP along the left column to (0,5) (another apple), etc. That seems a good path.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might also go for apples. The enemy is near the right side. There are apples on the right side too: (7,8), (7,1), (9,0), (7,4), (8,6), (6,7), (6,9), (7,0), (7,9). The enemy might go for those. I should focus on my own growth.\n\n**Long-term plan:** \nI want to collect apples safely. Since I'm at (1,2), the left column has several apples: (0,3), (0,5), (0,9). Also (1,8) is above. My plan for the next few turns: \n1. Move LEFT to (0,2) this turn.\n2. Next turn, move UP to (0,3) to eat the apple there.\n3. Then continue moving UP to (0,4), then (0,5) to eat another apple, etc. \nBut I must watch out for my own body as I grow. After eating the first apple at (0,3), my body will be at (0,2). Then moving UP to (0,4) is safe (no self-collision). Then from (0,4) to (0,5) to eat apple. That seems clear.\n\nAlso, I should avoid getting trapped by the board edge. Moving along the left edge is safe as long as I don't get stuck.\n\n**Potential threats:**\n- Enemy snake: It might move towards me? Unlikely, as there are apples on its side.\n- My own body: As I grow, I need to avoid hitting my tail. But since I'm moving in a straight line along the edge, it should be manageable.\n\n**Final decision:** \nI choose LEFT to move to (0,2). This sets up for eating the apple at (0,3) on the next turn, and I avoid immediate self-collision risks.\n\nTherefore, my move is LEFT.LEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state, I need to make a decision for Turn 1. My snake (ID 0) is at (0,2) after my last move LEFT. I am a single cell snake with no body. The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8,2). There are many apples, but I want to focus on the immediate safe moves and plan for the next turn.\n\nFirst, I need to check the safety of all four directions from my current position (0,2):\n1. **UP to (0,3)**: On board (y=3 is valid). No self-collision (I have no body). No enemy body. Is there an apple? Yes! (0,3) is listed in the apples. Moving UP would eat an apple immediately, which is great. However, I must consider enemy head movement. Enemy head at (8,2) could move in various directions. Could enemy move to (0,3)? No, impossible in one turn. Could enemy move to my head? No. So UP seems safe. If I move UP, after this turn my body will be at (0,2), and I'll be at (0,3) with 1 apple.\n2. **DOWN to (0,1)**: On board. Safe from self (no body). No enemy. No apple at (0,1). That's less desirable since I miss an apple opportunity.\n3. **LEFT to (-1,2)**: Off board (x=-1), so illegal and would kill me. Eliminated.\n4. **RIGHT to (1,2)**: On board. Safe from self (no body). No enemy. No apple at (1,2). But wait, (1,2) is the cell I just left last turn. After moving RIGHT, my previous position (0,2) becomes my body. However, moving RIGHT is not directly backwards? Actually, from (0,2), RIGHT is increasing x, so not into my own body since my body is none. So it's safe. But I miss the apple at (0,3).\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT vs DOWN: UP gives an immediate apple, which helps my score and growth. RIGHT and DOWN don't. Also, from a strategic perspective, moving UP to (0,3) aligns with a plan to go along the left edge where there are more apples: (0,5), (0,9). The apple at (0,3) is the closest. So UP seems the best.\n\nBut I must also consider potential head-on collisions. The enemy snake is at (8,2). If the enemy moves LEFT to (7,2), no collision. If enemy moves DOWN to (8,1) or UP to (8,3), no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (9,2), no collision. There's no scenario where the enemy head could reach (0,3) this turn. So no head-on risk.\n\nAlso, consider if there's any threat from enemy snake's possible movement towards me. The enemy is far, so no immediate threat.\n\nThus, UP is safe and beneficial. It gets me an apple and sets up for further apple collection on the left column.\n\nMy plan for next turn (if I survive): After moving UP to (0,3) and eating an apple, I'll have a body of one segment at (0,2). Then, I can consider moving UP again to (0,4) to continue towards (0,5) apple, or maybe go RIGHT if needed, but the left column seems safe.\n\nTherefore, my move is UP.UP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Staying on the edge provides a natural wall to one side, reducing attack vectors. Moving UP also preserves the ability to collect (0, 5) next turn. Moving RIGHT would require detouring back left later to get those apples, wasting turns and potentially getting trapped.\n\nStrategic decision: Continue moving UP along the safe left edge to gather apples efficiently and maintain positional advantage over the enemy, who is currently on the right side.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

It has 2 apples and is currently on the bottom edge.\nMy available moves from (0, 4):\n1. **UP to (0, 5)**: This is an apple. Moving here consumes the apple. My body is at (0, 3), so I don't collide with myself. The enemy is far away at (7, 0). This is a safe, high-value move. However, it leaves me at (0, 5) with a body at (0, 4). From (0, 5), my only safe move next turn would likely be RIGHT (to (1, 5)) because (0, 6) is blocked by my tail? No, wait. If I eat, I grow. My body becomes [(0, 4), (0, 3)] (assuming I don't eat, it would be [(0, 4), (0, 3)]?). No, if I eat at (0, 5), my tail (0, 3) stays. My new body is [(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)]. My next move from (0, 5) would be restricted.\n   - UP to (0, 6): (0, 6) is currently empty on the board state. It is safe.\n   - DOWN to (0, 4): Occupied by my own body. Fatal.\n   - LEFT to (-1, 5): Off board. Fatal.\n   - RIGHT to (1, 5): On board. Safe.\n   So (0, 5) offers 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT). This is acceptable but creates a bottleneck.\n2. **RIGHT to (1, 4)**: On board. Safe from self (body is at (0, 3)). Safe from enemy. No apple immediately. This positions me at (1, 4). From here, I can go UP to (1, 5), DOWN to (1, 3), or RIGHT to (2, 4). (LEFT is back to (0, 4) which is occupied by my body? No, my body is at (0, 3) currently. (0, 4) is empty after I move? Wait. If I move from (0, 4) to (1, 4), my body becomes [(0, 4), (0, 3)]. So (0, 4) is occupied. But I am moving to (1, 4). So from (1, 4) in the next turn, (0, 4) is a valid square (my body segment). I can move there. So from (1, 4), I have 4 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This keeps my options open significantly better than (0, 5).\n3. **DOWN to (0, 3)**: Occupied by my body. Fatal.\n4. **LEFT to (-1, 4)**: Off board. Fatal.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe enemy snake is at (7, 0). It is currently out of immediate threat range (Manhattan distance 10). It is likely moving towards apples on the right/bottom or the center.\nIf I move UP to (0, 5) and eat, I grow. I am forced into a corner (left edge). My next moves would be UP to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 5). While (0, 6) is currently empty, (0, 7) is empty, (0, 8) is empty, (0, 9) is an apple. I could potentially snake up the left edge. However, if the enemy decides to come up the left edge, or if the board closes in, I might get trapped. The path up the left edge is linear: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9). That is 4 moves including the current turn. If I go (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9), I collect 2 more apples (at 5 and 9). While doing this, my tail follows closely. If the enemy approaches the left side, I have no escape because x=0 is the wall and x=-1 is death. This is high risk if the enemy shifts left.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 4), I do not eat immediately. I keep my options open. I can navigate towards the center apples or circle back to the left edge apples when safe. The apple at (0, 5) is still there next turn (unless the enemy somehow gets it, which is impossible from (7, 0) in 1 turn). The apple at (0, 9) is safe for a while. By moving RIGHT, I avoid getting stuck in a corridor. I maintain the ability to react to the enemy's movement. The enemy is at (7, 0). If the enemy moves UP, I am safe. If the enemy moves LEFT, I am safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the safer long-term play. It prevents me from entering a potential trap on the left edge prematurely. I will collect the apple at (0, 5) later when I loop back or if the path remains clear. Currently, the board is open. Let's expand into the center to keep my movement fluid.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

However, looking at the current board state, the list of coordinates provided in the prompt contradicts the visual board representation for my snake's body. The prompt lists my body as `[(0, 4)]`, but the visual board shows `T` at (0, 4) and `0` at (1, 4). This discrepancy suggests that the text description (`[(0, 4)]`) represents my snake's state *before* the move, or there is an inconsistency. Given the visual board is the source of truth for the current turn's layout and the prompt explicitly asks to \"Use only the game state provided,\" I will base my analysis on the visual board.\n\n**Visual Board Analysis:**\n- My Head: (1, 4) (marked `0`)\n- My Tail: (0, 4) (marked `T`)\n- Enemy Head: (8, 0) (marked `1`)\n- Enemy Tails: (7, 0) and (7, 1) (marked `T`)\n\n**Available Moves from (1, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (1, 5):**\n    -   Board: Empty (shown as `.`).\n    -   Enemy: Snake #1 is at (8, 0). Safe distance.\n    -   Body: My body is at (0, 4). Moving UP does not cross my body.\n    -   Future: From (1, 5), I have access to (1, 6), (0, 5), (2, 5). Open.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 3):**\n    -   Board: Contains an Apple (A). (Coordinates (1, 3) show `A` in the row for y=3).\n    -   Enemy: Safe.\n    -   Body: Safe.\n    -   Future: Moving here consumes the apple. My body becomes [(1, 4), (0, 4)]. I will grow. This is a safe, scoring move.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 4):**\n    -   Board: My Tail (T).\n    -   Enemy: Safe.\n    -   Body: This is the cell immediately behind my head (tail). Moving here is \"moving directly backwards\" into my own body. This is fatal.\n    -   **Verdict:** KILLS ME.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    -   Board: Empty (shown as `.`).\n    -   Enemy: Safe.\n    -   Body: Safe.\n    -   Future: Open space. (2, 4) is safe.\n\n**Comparison & Strategy:**\n-   **LEFT** is immediate death (suicide into tail). Eliminated.\n-   **UP, DOWN, and RIGHT** are all safe regarding immediate collision.\n-   **DOWN** offers an immediate apple at (1, 3). Eating an apple is generally advantageous as it increases my score and length (potentially extending survival or reaching the 30-apple win condition). The position (1, 3) is not a corner; it has neighbors (1, 2), (0, 3), (2, 3) and (1, 4) (which will be my body).\n-   **UP and RIGHT** lead to empty cells. While expanding into open space is good, passing up a guaranteed apple is usually suboptimal unless the apple is a trap. (1, 3) is not a trap. It is adjacent to the bottom wall (y=0), but (1, 2) and (1, 1) are currently empty on the board.\n-   The enemy is far away at (8, 0) and does not threaten this move.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (1, 3) to eat the apple. This increases my score to 2, puts me in a relatively open area, and avoids the immediate suicide of moving LEFT.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of Current State and Long-Term Plan:**\n\nFirst, I need to resolve the discrepancy between the textual description of my body and the visual board. The textual description states my body is `[(1, 4), (0, 4)]` with the head at `(1, 3)`. The visual board shows `0` at `(1, 4)` and `T` at `(0, 4)`, with the row for `y=3` showing an apple at `(1, 3)`. The textual description aligns with the board's visual history (where I was at `(1, 4)` previously) and the apple location. The visual board seems to be displaying the state *before* my move or is slightly out of sync. However, the textual description explicitly says \"Your Snake (ID: 0): Head: (1, 3)\". I must prioritize the textual description as the ground truth for my current position. I am at `(1, 3)`. The visual board confirms an apple at `(1, 3)` (row 3 shows `.` for indices except `A` at (0,5) and (1,3) is `.`? Wait, looking closer at the visual board row `3` (which corresponds to y=3): `. 0 . . . . . . . .` in the prompt's visual grid. There is no apple at `(1, 3)` on the visual board. This is a contradiction. The prompt's text list of apples includes `(1, 8)`, `(7, 9)`, etc., but not `(1, 3)`. The text list of apples is: `(7, 8), (4, 9), (0, 5), (7, 4), (8, 6), (5, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (0, 9), (1, 8), (7, 9), (9, 1), (5, 6), (4, 5), (0, 7)`. No `(1, 3)`.\nWhy did I think there was an apple there? Looking back at my \"Last Rationale\" (which is part of the prompt context), I stated: \"DOWN to (1, 3): Board: Contains an Apple (A). (Coordinates (1, 3) show A in the row for y=3).\" The visual board in the prompt shows `. 0 . . . . . . . .` for row 3. There is no 'A'. My previous rationale was incorrect in reading the board. The visual board is the source of truth for the current state.\nWait, the prompt gives a list of apples: `(7, 8), (4, 9), (0, 5), (7, 4), (8, 6), (5, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (0, 9), (1, 8), (7, 9), (9, 1), (5, 6), (4, 5), (0, 7)`.\nLet's map the visual board against this list.\nRow 9: `A . . . A . A A . .` -> (0,9) A, (4,9) A, (6,9) A, (7,9) A. Matches list: (0,9), (4,9), (6,9), (7,9).\nRow 8: `. A . . . . . A . .` -> (1,8) A, (7,8) A. Matches list: (1,8), (7,8).\nRow 7: `A . . . . . A . . .` -> (0,7) A, (6,7) A. Matches list: (0,7), (6,7).\nRow 6: `. . . . . A . . A .` -> (5,6) A, (8,6) A. Matches list: (5,6), (8,6).\nRow 5: `A . . . A A . . . .` -> (0,5) A, (4,5) A, (5,5) A. Matches list: (0,5), (4,5), (5,5).\nRow 4: `T T . . . . . A . .` -> (7,4) A. Matches list: (7,4).\nRow 3: `. 0 . . . . . . . .` -> No apples.\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 1: `. . . . . . . T . A` -> (9,1) A. Matches list: (9,1).\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . T T 1`\nThe apple list and the visual board match perfectly. There is NO apple at (1, 3). My previous move (DOWN to 1,3) was based on a hallucination of an apple. The prompt text says \"My last move information: ... DOWN\". The prompt text says \"Head: (1, 3)\". This means I successfully moved to (1, 3). Since there was no apple there, I did not grow. My body length remains 2. My body segments are at the previous head position (1, 4) and the previous tail position (0, 4). My current head is (1, 3).\n\n**Current State Check:**\n- **Me:** Head (1, 3). Body: [(1, 4), (0, 4)]. (Assuming I just moved DOWN from 1,4 to 1,3).\n- **Enemy:** Head (9, 0). Body: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)].\n- **Apples:** None at (1, 3). Nearest apples: (0, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (7, 4) etc.\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 3):**\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):**\n    -   Board: Visual board shows `0` at (1, 4) (representing my previous position, now my body).\n    -   Collision: This is my own body segment. **DEAD**.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):**\n    -   Board: Visual board shows `.` (empty).\n    -   Collision: Safe.\n    -   Geometry: (1, 2) is above the bottom wall (y=0).\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):**\n    -   Board: Visual board shows `.` (empty).\n    -   Collision: Safe.\n    -   Geometry: Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    -   Board: Visual board shows `.` (empty).\n    -   Collision: Safe.\n    -   Geometry: Safe.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\nSince I am at (1, 3) with no apple, I need to navigate towards the apples in the top-left or central area. The apples are clustered at (0,5), (4,5), (5,5), (0,7), etc.\nMy current position is (1, 3). The open space is (1, 2), (0, 3), (2, 3).\nMoving **LEFT** to (0, 3) is the most direct path towards the cluster of apples at (0, 5) and (0, 7). It also keeps me near the left wall, which can be a safer boundary than the center if the enemy (at (9,0) - far right) expands.\nMoving **DOWN** to (1, 2) moves me away from all apples (the nearest apples are at y=4 and y=5).\nMoving **RIGHT** to (2, 3) moves me towards the center, but (1, 3) is already a good central-west position.\n\nLet's compare **LEFT (0, 3)** vs **DOWN (1, 2)**:\n- **LEFT (0, 3):** Gets me closer to (0, 5) and (0, 7). Opens up path to (0, 4) (currently my body, but will be empty next turn if I keep moving) or (0, 2) if I need to retreat. It also protects my left side. The enemy is at (9,0), so they are not threatening the left side.\n- **DOWN (1, 2):** Moves away from apples. While (1, 2) is safe, I am then forced to move UP or LEFT/RIGHT eventually to get apples. Moving DOWN now puts me in a position where I might be trapped against the bottom wall if I am not careful. (1, 2) has neighbors (1, 1), (1, 3) (my body next turn), (0, 2), (2, 2).\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (0, 3).\nReasoning:\n1.  **Apple Proximity:** It brings me closer to the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 7).\n2.  **Safety:** It creates a boundary (the wall at x=0) which simplifies navigation. I can \"hug\" the left wall to collect apples on that column.\n3.  **Avoidance:** Moving DOWN (1, 2) is a detour. Moving RIGHT (2, 3) is viable but puts me more in the open where the enemy might eventually path. The enemy is at (9, 0) (bottom right). They are currently moving up or right. They are not an immediate threat to the top-left.\n4.  **Body Mechanics:** My body is at (1, 4) and (0, 4). Moving to (0, 3) means my next body segment will be at (1, 3). The tail will be at (1, 4). This is a standard move.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 3). Next turn, likely move UP to (0, 4) (which will be empty as my body moves from (1, 4) to (1, 3) to (0, 3)? No, my body moves as I move.\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 3) now:\n- My head: (0, 3)\n- My body: (1, 3), (1, 4) [Wait, (0, 4) was the previous tail? No, prompt says body was [(1, 4), (0, 4)] before my move. My move DOWN to (1, 3) made body [(1, 4), (0, 4)]? No.\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"My snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (1, 3)\n  - Body: [(1, 4), (0, 4)]\"\nThis is the CURRENT state. I am at (1, 3). The body follows.\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 3):\n- New Head: (0, 3)\n- New Body: Old Head (1, 3) + Old Body [(1, 4), (0, 4)] -> [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4)].\n- Tail: (0, 4).\nThis is valid.\n\nNext move after LEFT: From (0, 3), I can go UP to (0, 4).\nWait, (0, 4) is currently part of my body (the tail). By the time I move to (0, 3), the tail will have moved.\nIf I move to (0, 3) now, my body becomes [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4)].\nNext turn, if I move UP to (0, 4):\n- The tail (0, 4) will move to (0, 3) (following the body).\n- The segment (1, 4) will move to (0, 4).\n- The segment (1, 3) will move to (1, 4).\n- My head moves to (0, 4).\nSo (0, 4) will be empty or occupied by a body segment moving there.\nActually, if I am at (0, 3) and the body is [(1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4)], moving UP to (0, 4) is moving into the current tail position. As the tail moves away to (0, 3), (0, 4) becomes free. This is a valid \"forward\" move (not backwards).\nSo the plan is: Move LEFT to (0, 3). Next turn, move UP to (0, 4). This navigates me up the left edge towards the apples at (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9).\n\nEnemy Check: Enemy is at (9, 0). They are far. They are moving. They likely want apples on the right or center. I am safe on the left.\n\nFinal check on coordinates:\n(1, 3) -> LEFT is (0, 3). Correct.\nIs (0, 3) occupied? Visual board shows `.` at (0, 3) (row 3 is `. 0 . . . . . . . .`, index 0 is `.`).\nIs (0, 3) a wall? No, x=0 is the left wall, but (0, 3) is a valid coordinate.\nIs (0, 3) suicide? No. My body is at (1, 4) and (0, 4). (0, 3) is not my body.\nIs (0, 3) backwards? My previous move was DOWN. LEFT is not backwards from DOWN.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",
