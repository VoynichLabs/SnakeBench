You\u2019re ahead on apples, so pressure him into mistakes rather than chase every apple.  \nMove rationale: UP to (7,9) grabs the apple at (7,9) this turn (+1 apple), extends your lead, and preserves a strong top-right corridor with multiple safe follow-ups (6,9 or 8,9) next turns. It also keeps you in a flexible shape to pivot away from any sudden pressure.  \nLong-term plan: Maintain two safe exits after each move, creep the control toward the top-right to pin him toward the left edge, and bait him into a head-on when apples are favorable. Exploit the lead by forcing mistakes rather than reckless chases.  \nDecision:  \nUP",

No immediate collision risk with the opponent.\n\n- RISK CHECK: Opponent is far left (0,7). No forced head-on this turn. We\u2019re not boxed in yet; DOWN preserves space to maneuver and chase future apples if they spawn nearby.\n\nLong-term plan (for future turns):\n- Edgeboxing: nudge him toward the left/top corridors gradually to shrink his available space while we keep two safe exits.\n- Score pressure: try to force a favorable head-on only if we have a clear apples lead; otherwise avoid mutual KO risk.\n- Stay mobile: avoid tight loops or self-traps; keep at least two viable next moves for the next turn.\n- Watch spawns: apples near our new corridors can swing the momentum; prioritize growth only if it doesn\u2019t compromise space.\n\nDOWN",

Should I charge straight into their head cell, slip up, or go up/down to stay flexible? \ud83e\udd14  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 If I go RIGHT I grab the cell they\u2019re occupying, forcing them to move away and possibly setting up a head\u2011on crash next turn when they chase me. It also pushes me toward the (8,6) apple and keeps the pressure on. Moving UP or DOWN is safe but keeps me stuck near the edge and gives fewer aggressive options.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan:  \n- Move RIGHT now to occupy their head spot, push them back, and set up a future collision when they try to follow.  \n- Keep an eye on the (8,6) apple and aim to grow beyond 10 apples before turn 30.  \n- Never let my tail block my only escape \u2013 always leave at least two viable directions.  \n\nRIGHT",
