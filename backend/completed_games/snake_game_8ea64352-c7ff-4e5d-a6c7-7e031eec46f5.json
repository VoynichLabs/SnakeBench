Great for growth, but it would lock us into a length\u20112 snake with the tail stuck at (3,9), meaning we can\u2019t retreat left right away. Slightly restrictive. \ud83c\udf4f\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,8) = apple **and** still keeps a decent number of exits (left, right, down) for the next turn. Plus we close the distance to the rival (Manhattan distance drops from 7 to 5). \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Opponent\u2019s likely move**\nFrom (5,5) they can only reach (4,5), (6,5), (5,4) or (5,6) this turn \u2013 nowhere near our chosen square. No chance of a head\u2011on collision.\n\n**Strategic vibe**\nGrab that apple, grow a segment, and stay mobile. We\u2019ll be one step closer to the middle of the board, ready to herd the other snake into a corner later. Aggressive, yet safe. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Bottom line:** the safest, most rewarding move right now is to head straight down into that tasty apple.\n\nDOWN",

We gotta be aggressive, grow, and pressure him into a corner. Ready to box him in? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nQuick safety check (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT):\n- UP -> (5,6): SAFE. Leaves 3 follow-ups (5,7),(4,6),(6,6). Good mobility.\n- DOWN -> (5,4): SAFE. Leaves 3 follow-ups (5,3 is an apple), solid options.\n- LEFT -> (4,5): APPLE and SAFE. Leaves 3 follow-ups (4,6),(4,4),(3,5). Closes distance to the enemy (x from 2 \u2192 1).\n- RIGHT -> (6,5): SAFE. Leaves 3 follow-ups (6,6),(6,4),(7,5).\n\nNo immediate death moves (no bodies to crash into, opponent too far for a head-on this turn). All four have equal immediate mobility, but LEFT gives us an apple (growth +1) and moves us closer to the enemy \u2014 perfect for forcing aggression and later head-on leverage once we\u2019re bigger. We want to grow early so we can punish him if he over-commits.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab the apple at (4,5) now to grow. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Then push north-west toward the top quadrant to corral the opponent around the (2-4,7-9) area. Keep pressure on his lateral escape routes.\n- Avoid risky head-to-head until we have a size advantage; if apples swing in our favor, force a head-on when he\u2019s trapped against the wall. Kill or be killed? We kill. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFinal move \u2014 let\u2019s grab that apple and start the squeeze.\n\nLEFT",

Their realistic moves: UP (6,8), LEFT (5,7), or DOWN (6,6).\n- They\u2019re separated vertically; they can\u2019t threaten our head this turn.\n- Their body blocks the top-right corridor at (6,9) and (7,9) \u2014 that\u2019s BAD for us if we try to sprint right along row 9 because our escape options shrink.\n\nWhy NOT RIGHT:\n- RIGHT to (5,9) is safe now but it reduces our future options. After moving to (5,9), LEFT becomes the neck (back move forbidden) so we\u2019d have only DOWN or RIGHT next turn. RIGHT after that would be into an opponent segment at (6,9) right now (instant death if we do it before their tail vacates). That sequence risks getting boxed with few safe follow-ups.

More mobility = more opportunities to control space and react to the opponent\u2019s drop.\n- Keeps pressure potential: if the enemy drops toward the middle, we can cut exits or close the trap from a safer angle.\n- Avoids unnecessary head-on risk while we\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 we force them to run into tight spaces instead.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to gain maneuverability.\n- Watch enemy\u2019s next move: if they drop, pivot right to hem them in; if they go toward center, follow and compress from the side while keeping an escape lane.\n- Only force a head-on if we gain apples or the math flips \u2014 otherwise trap and pick off.\n\nAlright fam, make this move clean and keep breathing down their neck.\n\nDOWN",

Their realistic moves: LEFT -> (5,6), RIGHT -> (7,6), DOWN -> (6,5).\n\nConsidered moves:\n- UP -> (4,9): ILLEGAL (neck/backwards).\n- LEFT -> (3,8): safe now, but pulls us away from the fight and slows encirclement.\n- RIGHT -> (5,8): safe and aggressive, but edges us into the opponent\u2019s upper-blocked corridor (lots of their body at x\u22656,y\u22657) and could reduce escape options soon.\n- DOWN -> (4,7): safe, keeps 3 non-backwards follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) and moves us closer to the enemy\u2019s zone without forcing a head-on. From (4,7) we can pivot RIGHT to hem them in or bait them left while preserving an escape lane.\n\nWhy DOWN (the move):\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (2 vs 6). We must NOT force a head-on unless we have the apple advantage. DOWN gains mobility and inches us toward their head-level so we can compress their available space next turn.\n- DOWN keeps multiple safe follow-ups and avoids committing into the tight top-right corridor where their body already blocks exits.\n- If they try to run left toward the center, we can cut them off from the side. If they try to close us, we still have escape options to the left or down.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (4,7).\n- On their next move, shadow their most probable escape (if they go LEFT to (5,6), prepare RIGHT to (5,7) to compress; if they go RIGHT/DOWN, keep pivoting to cut exits while keeping at least one escape lane).\n- Avoid head-on unless we flip the apple count or we can guarantee their death without our head also dying.\n\nDOWN",

Neck = (2,8) \u2192 moving RIGHT is directly into our neck (backwards) = illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy.  \n- Adjacent cells to consider: UP = (1,9), DOWN = (1,7), LEFT = (0,8).\n\nImmediate safety scan:  \n- Opponent head at (3,4) with a dense body cluster around x=4\u20137, y=4\u20137. They\u2019re lower-right of us and currently out of immediate head-butting range. We CANNOT force a head-on \u2014 they\u2019ve got 7 apples vs our 2. No suicidal melees.  \n- LEFT (0,8) has an apple! That\u2019s a free point and growth \u2014 chips into their lead and increases our board control on the left flank.  \n- UP (1,9) keeps us on the top row and would limit vertical escape (only left/right available next turn), though it gives a follow-up apple at (0,9) if we go that route.  \n- DOWN (1,7) moves us closer to the opponent cluster (bad) and doesn\u2019t give an immediate apple.\n\nMove reasoning (short, spicy):  \n- We need apples to close the 5-apple gap but we can\u2019t gamble against snake #0. LEFT gets us an apple immediately, expands our length (more body to block with), and keeps distance from the enemy hive. It also leaves two good exits next turn (UP to 0,9 or DOWN to 0,7). That\u2019s mobility + scoring. Win-win. \ud83c\udf4f\u2728\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):  \n- Eat (0,8) now to grow and reduce their lead.  \n- Use the left column as our corridor: if they try to swing left to chase, we\u2019ll kite up/down to force them into their own cluster.  \n- Avoid moving into the dense right-side cluster; only engage if we can guarantee they run into our body or we have more apples than them. Stay smart, stay hungry. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nAlright chat \u2014 final read and lock it in. LET\u2019S GO.\n\nLEFT",

If they overcommit for apples, bait them into colliding with our body. Stay smart \u2014 no suicidal head-ons while behind in apples.\n\nShort, spicy final read: safe eat + growth > passive move.

No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n- We\u2019re behind on apples 4 vs 7 \u2014 we need to be aggressive about securing grow opportunities, but not at the cost of dying. Moving RIGHT preserves mobility (more than being stuck at the top-left corner) and lets us run along the top row to pressure the board and swing toward top apples (like the (9,9) apple) later.  \n- Moving RIGHT also prevents us from getting boxed in by our own body on the next turns \u2014 it opens lateral space and keeps future options (top-row corridor control). We\u2019ll avoid any immediate suicidal head-on while we chip away at apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):  \n- Take RIGHT now to (1,9) to get off the corner and regain options.  \n- Then push RIGHT along the top row (e.g., to 2,9 then 3,9) to build lateral dominance and threaten the top-right apples (including 9,9).  \n- If the enemy tries to swarm or close from the midboard, use the top/left corridor to kite and create blocking body lines \u2014 bait them into colliding with our body if they overcommit. If we manage to surpass them in apples, force a head-on. Stay aggressive but alive.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 no flashy moves, just smart control.

We are trailing on apples (4 vs 8) \u2014 never gamble on a mutual KO when behind. HIGH RISK. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) = clear now, keeps us on the top row, preserves lots of options, and puts us on the path to the high-value apple at (9,9).

We must avoid double KO scenarios \u2014 that hands the match to #0. \ud83d\ude24\n- Moving east along y=9 keeps us open: we retain lateral room to snake across the top and then fold down the east side to attempt a box.

Only force head\u2011ons if we\u2019re ahead and it wins the game. \ud83d\ude08\n\nAlright fam \u2014 lock it in and let\u2019s make him crash. Final move: \nRIGHT",

Then ride down the east wall to fold back and tighten space on #0.\n- Avoid forcing head\u2011ons while still trailing. Pressure them into narrow corridors around x=3\u20136 where their long body is stretched.\n- Use our tail and growth to create a moving wall; bait them into risky moves or trap them against our body without trading heads.\n\nFinal move locked in \u2014 keep the aggression smart, not suicidal.

Quick, ruthless scan before we lock it in.\n\nCheck all four directions from our head at (9,9):\n- UP \u2192 (9,10) is off-board. Instant death. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) is our neck (backwards). Illegal. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,9) is off-board. Death. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) is the only legal square. It\u2019s empty this turn, BUT the enemy head at (8,8) can move RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) simultaneously and force a head\u2011on. If they do that, both of us die and they win (they have 8 apples vs our 5). This is a huge risk, but it\u2019s the only legal move that doesn\u2019t immediately kill us.\n\nAssessment: We have no safe alternatives \u2014 DOWN is forced. We must take it and hope the opponent doesn\u2019t choose the suicidal win-by-double-KO (they will if they want the guaranteed victory). If they avoid the collision, we survive to fight another turn.\n\nShort-term plan after DOWN:\n- If opponent doesn\u2019t go RIGHT, press south along the east edge to secure nearby apples (like (9,7)) and use our growing tail to form a moving wall.\n- Avoid moves that let them force a head-on when they can win by mutual death; keep options open by not hugging dead\u2011ends.\n- Look to compress them toward x=3 column where their body is long and slow to turn.\n\nLet\u2019s do the only legal play that keeps us playing: \nDOWN",
