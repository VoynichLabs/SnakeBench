DOWN would move into your neck at (8,1) and is not allowed.\n- Among safe options, UP keeps you on a straight path toward the nearest reachable apple at (8,6) along the same column, while LEFT would divert you toward the apple at (1,6) and could create tighter future constraints. RIGHT could run toward the edge with less immediate benefit.\n- Enemies are far from this path; head-on risk is low for the immediate next steps.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move UP to approach the apple at (8,6) along column x=8. After securing that apple, reassess targets (e.g., (6,7) or (1,6)) and maintain multiple safe options to avoid trapping yourself. Stay away from dead-ends and avoid stepping into your own neck in future moves.\n\nUP",

Moving up is the safest option for the turn because it avoids collision, and also allows me to progress toward the apple at (5, 1).\n\nI need to evaluate the risk of eating the apple at (5, 1) while also avoiding a collision with Snake #0. Eating the apple at (5, 1) will increase my apple count and may create opportunity for me to eat apples in the future. However, it might also lead to immediate contact with Snake #0 given their current positions.\n\nMy options are:\n1. UP: Safest, avoids immediate collision.\n2.
