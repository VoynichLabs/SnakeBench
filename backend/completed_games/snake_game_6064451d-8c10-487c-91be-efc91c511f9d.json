A . . . . . . 0\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . A . 1 . . A . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . . A . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (4, 4). Let me consider each direction:\n\n1. UP: (4, 5) - Empty cell, safe\n2. DOWN: (4, 3) - Empty cell, safe\n3. LEFT: (3, 4) - Empty cell, safe\n4. RIGHT: (5, 4) - Empty cell, safe\n\nAll four moves are safe since I have no body and the enemy snake is far away at (9, 9).\n\nNow let me think about which apples to target:\n\nDistances from (4, 4):\n- (2, 4): Manhattan distance = |4-2| + |4-4| = 2 (closest, same row!)\n- (2, 2): Manhattan distance = |4-2| + |4-2| = 4\n- (7, 4): Manhattan distance = |4-7| + |4-4| = 3 (same row!)\n- (1, 6): Manhattan distance = |4-1| + |4-6| = 5\n- (2, 9): Manhattan distance = |4-2| + |4-9| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 4), which is directly to my LEFT (2 cells away on the same row).\nThe second closest is at (7, 4), which is directly to my RIGHT (3 cells away on the same row).\n\nSince (2, 4) is closer, I should go LEFT.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 9), which is very far from me. They might go for (2, 9) or (7, 4). Let me think about their options:\n- (2, 9): distance from (9,9) = |9-2| + |9-9| = 7\n- (7, 4): distance from (9,9) = |9-7| + |9-4| = 7\n- (1, 6): distance from (9,9) = |9-1| + |9-6| = 11\n- (2, 4): distance from (9,9) = |9-2| + |9-4| = 12\n- (2, 2): distance from (9,9) = |9-2| + |9-2| = 14\n\nThe enemy might go for (2, 9) or (7, 4) since they're equidistant and closest.\n\nMy strategy:\n1. Go LEFT to collect the apple at (2, 4) first (2 moves)\n2. Then either go to (2, 2) which would be 2 more moves south\n3. Or go to (1, 6) which would be 3 moves (1 left, 2 up)\n\nThe cluster at x=2 (apples at (2,4), (2,2), (1,6), (2,9)) seems like a good area to focus on since I can collect multiple apples efficiently.\n\nFor this turn, I should move LEFT to start heading toward (2, 4).\n\nLet me double-check:\n- LEFT from (4, 4) goes to (3, 4)\n- This is safe (no walls, no snake bodies)\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (2, 4)\n\nDecision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current game state:\n\nMy head is at (4, 4) with no body yet. The enemy snake is at (9, 9), very far away.\n\nLet me analyze the apples and their distances from me:\n- (2, 4): Distance = 2 (same row, just 2 cells left!)\n- (7, 4): Distance = 3 (same row, to the right)\n- (2, 2): Distance = 4\n- (1, 6): Distance = 5\n- (2, 9): Distance = 7\n\nAll four directions are safe since I have no body and the enemy is far away.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe apple cluster around x=2 looks very attractive: (2,4), (2,2), (1,6), and (2,9). I can efficiently collect multiple apples in that area. The closest apple at (2,4) is directly to my left on the same row.\n\nThe enemy at (9,9) is likely to go for either (2,9) or (7,4) which are their closest options. They're too far to interfere with my plan for the left-side apples in the near term.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move LEFT twice to reach (2,4) and collect first apple\n2. Then move DOWN twice to (2,2) for second apple\n3. Consider (1,6) next, then potentially (2,9) if safe\n\nFor this turn, I'll move LEFT to start heading toward the closest apple at (2,4).\n\nLEFT",
