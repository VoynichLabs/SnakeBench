Board is wide open, no bodies yet, so the only instant-death risks this turn are:\n- Going off the board (not an issue for any of our four moves right now).\n- Head-on collision (both heads entering the same cell \u2013 impossible this turn given positions).\n\nEnemy from **(9,0)** can only go:\n- UP \u2192 (9,1) \u2705 (and there\u2019s an apple there \ud83d\udc40)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,0) \u2705\nThey can\u2019t go DOWN or RIGHT (off-board).\n\nWe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (7,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2)\n\nAll are technically safe this turn. So now it\u2019s about POSITIONAL DOMINANCE \ud83d\ude08  \n\n### Positional thinking\n- Moving **DOWN** pushes us closer to the enemy and pins us toward the bottom wall. That shrinks our long-term space. Bad for future flexibility.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (8,2) pulls us toward the right wall and closer to their column. With them at x=9, we\u2019re voluntarily entering a tighter lane on that side early.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (6,2) is safe and more central, but doesn\u2019t pressure anything important yet.\n- Moving **UP** to (7,3) keeps us:\n  - More central vertically (more future options up and down).\n  - Still in striking distance of mid-right apples and later the enemy\u2019s escape routes.\n  - Away from any early awkward tight corners on the bottom/right.\n\nEnemy is almost certainly going to grab that **(9,1)** apple soon, growing along the right edge. We want to build from the middle-right outward so we can later **cut off their escape** from the corner instead of joining them in the cramped bottom-right box too early.\n\n### PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF \ud83c\udfaf\n- Prioritize staying **central-right** (columns ~6\u20138, rows ~3\u20137) to control access between bottom-right and the rest of the board.\n- Let the enemy grow near the right and bottom edge; our job is to grow in more open space so we can later curl around and **wall them in** from above/left.\n- Avoid committing to the bottom rows too early; we want maximum mobility to respond to wherever they go after taking that (9,1) apple.\n\nWe stay flexible, we scale up, then we suffocate them later. For now, we take the high ground:\n\nUP",

Meh.\n\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**  \n  - Slides us closer to the enemy\u2019s column.  \n  - If they go **LEFT to (8,1)** we\u2019re now stacked above them on the same file \u2013 super easy to end up in a vertical chicken game at (8,2) later, which we **don\u2019t want yet** since a double KO favors them.\n\n- **LEFT (6,3)**  \n  - Safest, more central, but it **cedes** the upper-right lanes.  \n  - That lets them climb the right wall to **(9,7)/(8,7)** and farm while we\u2019re too far to contest or box.\n\n- **UP (7,4)**  \n  - Keeps us center-right with tons of future options.  \n  - Puts us one move away from the juicy **(8,4)** apple next turn, giving us parity in score (1\u20131) and a body segment to start forming walls.  \n  - Still comfortably far from their likely paths **UP** along x=9 or **LEFT** to (8,1), minimizing surprise jousts.\n\nThis is the best blend of **safety now + future dominance**. We step up, then likely snap right to control that 8-column corridor and start building a cage around them later.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF\n\n- Next few turns, favor paths like **(7,4) \u2192 (8,4)** to grab that apple and get to **1\u20131**.  \n- After growing, anchor a body along columns **7\u20138** between rows **3\u20137**, so we can eventually:\n  - Cut off their climb from the bottom-right,\n  - Then curl over the top to box them against the right/bottom walls.\n- No reckless head-on challenges until we\u2019re **at least tied** in apples; after that, we can start forcing knife-fight corridors where our body is the terrain and their only exits run through us. \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

We want:\n\n- Fast, safe growth to even the score.\n- Good future mobility, especially around enemy in bottom-right.\n- No double-KO while we\u2019re behind (or even right after we tie).\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (7,5)\n- Keeps us away from the enemy.\n- But **we skip the free apple at (8,4)** and stay 0\u20131 behind.\n- Also leaves (8,4) open for them to path into later. Not good.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (7,3)\n- Pulls us **toward** the enemy\u2019s side without growing.\n- We go closer while still smaller. That\u2019s just volunteering for a bad trade later.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (6,4)\n- Safe and central, but again **ignores (8,4)**.\n- Cedes that nice corridor on the right side where we eventually want to box him in.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)  \u2705\n- We eat the apple \u2192 we go to **1\u20131** on apples, length 2.\n- We park in **center-right**, very close to the enemy\u2019s lane but not colliding.\n- From there we can start forming a vertical wall along **x = 7\u20138**, cutting off his paths out of the bottom-right in a few turns.\n- Next turn, our body will be **[(8,4), (7,4)]**, so the only forbidden move will be directly **backwards (LEFT)**. We\u2019ll still have **3 good options**.\n\nThis is **exactly** what we want: secure growth + prime position to start boxing without any forced head-on yet.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick peek at enemy replies after RIGHT\n\nAfter we go **RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)**:\n\n### If they go UP \u2192 (9,3)\n- We\u2019re at **(8,4)**, they\u2019re at **(9,3)**.\n- Next turn:\n  - Us: can go **UP (8,5)**, **DOWN (8,3)**, **RIGHT (9,4)** (LEFT is backwards into (7,4) \u274c).\n  - Them: can go **UP (9,4)** or **LEFT (8,3)**.\n- Head-on only happens if:\n  - We go **DOWN (8,3)** and they go **LEFT (8,3)**, or  \n  - We go **RIGHT (9,4)** and they go **UP (9,4)**.\n- In both cases, we\u2019d be **1\u20131** on apples \u2192 double KO = **draw**. We can simply avoid those combos and keep playing for a win.\n\n### If they go LEFT \u2192 (8,2)\n- We\u2019re at **(8,4)**, they\u2019re at **(8,2)** (stacked vertically).\n- Next turn:\n  - Us: **UP (8,5)**, **DOWN (8,3)**, **RIGHT (9,4)**.\n  - Them: **UP (8,3)**, **LEFT (7,2)**, **DOWN (8,1)**.\n- Only dangerous head-on is both to **(8,3)** (our DOWN vs their UP) \u2192 again 1\u20131 draw. Easy to dodge if we don\u2019t want it.\n\nSo **RIGHT now is safe**, gets us bigger, and keeps control over future fights.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self \ud83d\udcd3\n\n- You\u2019re about to be **1\u20131** on apples and length 2 at **(8,4)**.\n- Avoid dumb head-ons while tied unless it clearly forces them through your longer body later.\n- Aim to:\n  - Grow while sweeping **upward** on the right side.\n  - Build a body \u201cfence\u201d in columns **7\u20138** so you can eventually **wrap above them** and squeeze them into a corner.\n- Once you\u2019re **ahead on apples**, then we can happily force a head-on in a tight corridor they can\u2019t dodge.\n\nRIGHT",

Too soft for us, chat \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Option C: UP \u2192 (8,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP hits an apple at (8,7), so we **grow**:\n\nBefore:\n- [(8,6), (8,5)]\n\nAfter UP + apple:\n- New head: (8,7)\n- Body: [(8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]  \u2192 length 3, apples 2 \u2705\n\nEnemy responses:\n\n1. **Enemy UP \u2192 (9,6)**  \n   - Their snake: [(9,6), (9,5)]\n   - Our body: (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)  \n   - No overlap, no collision, both live.\n   - We\u2019re now **ahead 2\u20131 in apples and longer 3 vs 2**.\n\n2. **Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,5)**  \n   - Their snake: [(8,5), (9,5)]\n   - Our body after move includes (8,5) as tail.\n   - Their head moves into our body at (8,5) \u2192 they **die**, we **live** \ud83e\ude78\n\nSo by going UP:\n- We **cannot die this turn**.\n- We either:\n  - Go to 2\u20131 and length 3 vs 2 (if they play safe UP), **or**\n  - They kill themselves instantly if they go LEFT into our tail.\n\nThat\u2019s insane value:\n- We gain apple lead.\n- We gain length advantage.\n- We create a trap where one of their natural moves (LEFT) becomes suicide.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of dominance we want \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan (note to future me \ud83d\ude0f)\n\n- Priority this turn: **GO UP**, secure (8,7), get to apples 2\u20131, length 3\u20132.\n- Use our longer body along column 8 (and possibly 7) as a **vertical wall** to squeeze them against the right edge.\n- Once we\u2019re longer, we can start **threatening head-on collisions** on lines where:\n  - If they challenge us, it\u2019s a head-on with us longer \u2192 we win.\n  - If they dodge, they\u2019re pushed into our body or the board edge.\n- Gradually expand control over the **top-right** lane, then push leftward to reduce their space until they\u2019re forced into a bad trade or a crash into our body.\n\nWe lock in the apple lead **now**, then bully them with size and position later \ud83d\ude24\n\nup",

Time to weaponize that lead \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Our legal moves\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,8) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6) \u274c directly backwards into our own body \u2192 instant death\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) \u2705 apple there\n\nSo candidates: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\nEnemy from (9,6):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,7) \u2705 apple\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6) \u2705 currently our body\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) \u274c backwards into own body\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,6) \u274c off-board\n\nSo they really only have **UP or LEFT** if they want to live (or at least try).\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate each of our moves vs their responses\n\n### Option A: UP to (8,8) \ud83d\ude10\n\nWe move to (8,8), no apple:\n- Our new body: [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]\n\nEnemy choices:\n\n- Enemy UP \u2192 (9,7) (apple):\n  - Their snake: [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5)], apples become 2\n  - No collision with us\n  - Result: **2\u20132 apples, equal length, both alive**\n\n- Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,6):\n  - Their head hits our body at (8,6) \u2192 **they die, we live**\n\nSo if we go UP:\n- Best for *them* is UP (tie the score, stay alive).\n- Worst for them is LEFT (suicide).\n- Worst-case for us = they pick UP \u2192 no immediate win, we lose our apple lead.\n\nSafe, but not lethal. Kinda soft, right chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### Option B: LEFT to (7,7) \ud83d\ude10\n\nWe move to (7,7), no apple:\n- Our new body: [(7,7), (8,7), (8,6)]\n\nEnemy choices:\n\n- Enemy UP \u2192 (9,7) (apple):\n  - Enemy: [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5)], apples = 2\n  - No collision\n  - Again **2\u20132 apples, both alive**\n\n- Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,6):\n  - Our body has (8,6), so they run into us \u2192 **they die, we live**\n\nSame story as UP: they have a safe equalizing move (UP) and a suicide (LEFT). So worst-case for us is them going UP and tying the game. Still no forced win.\n\n---\n\n### Option C: RIGHT to (9,7) \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80\n\nNow we cook. We go RIGHT onto the apple at (9,7):\n\n- We eat apple \u2192 apples: 3\n- Our new body: [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]\n\nEnemy choices:\n\n1. **Enemy UP \u2192 (9,7)**  \n   - Both heads move to **(9,7)** at the same time \u2192 **head-on collision**.\n   - Both snakes die this turn.\n   - Apples after moving:\n     - We collected the apple at (9,7): we go from 2 \u2192 **3**\n     - They also move onto the same apple: 1 \u2192 **2**\n   - Final score on double KO: **we have 3, they have 2 \u2192 we WIN** \u2705\n\n   Even in the worst interpretation where nobody gets the apple in a head-on, it\u2019s still:\n   - We: 2, They: 1 \u2192 we still WIN the double KO.  \n   So any way you slice it, head-on at (9,7) is **our victory**.\n\n2. **Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,6)**  \n   - After our move, our body includes (8,6): [(9,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]\n   - Their head moves into our body at (8,6) \u2192 **they die, we live**\n   - We keep the apple, so apples = **3\u20131**, and we\u2019re the only survivor \u2192 instant WIN \u2705\n\n3. Any suicidal move (DOWN or RIGHT) by them:\n   - They die alone, we live and take the apple \u2192 also WIN \u2705\n\nSo if we go RIGHT:\n- No line leads to our loss.\n- Every enemy move (UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) ends the game **this turn** with **us as the winner**.\n- Either:\n  - Double KO where we win on apples, **or**\n  - They slam into our body or a wall and we survive with an even bigger lead.\n\nThis is literally a **forced win** right now. Why give them extra turns when we can END THEIR CAREER ON THE SPOT, chat?! \ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini long-term plan (if somehow they grief incorrectly and game continues)\n\n- Maintain apple lead and length edge; keep playing for **head-on threats** where any challenge from them loses.\n- Use our longer body as walls to shrink their space along the right edge.\n- Prefer moves that keep 2+ safe exits while constantly nudging closer to them to force worse trades for them.\n\nBut honestly? We\u2019re about to delete them this turn \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",
