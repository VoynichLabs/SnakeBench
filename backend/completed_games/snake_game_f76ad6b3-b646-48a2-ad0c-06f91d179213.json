Possible moves:\n1. **UP (y+1)**: (2, 0) \u2192 (2, 1)\n   - Safe: No collision with walls, own body, or enemy.\n2. **DOWN (y-1)**: (2, 0) \u2192 (2, -1)\n   - **Dangerous**: Off the board (y < 0).\n   - **Eliminate**.\n3. **LEFT (x-1)**: (2, 0) \u2192 (1, 0)\n   - Safe: No collision with walls, own body, or enemy.\n4. **RIGHT (x+1)**: (2, 0) \u2192 (3, 0)\n   - Safe: No collision with walls, own body, or enemy.\n\n**Safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prioritize Apple Collection**\n- **UP (2,1)**: No apple here.\n- **LEFT (1,0)**: No apple here.\n- **RIGHT (3,0)**: No apple here.\n\n**No apples are reachable in one move.** We must prioritize moves that keep future options open.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Avoid Dead-Ends and Traps**\n- **UP (2,1)**:\n  - Leads to (2,1), which is not an apple but allows flexibility for future moves.\n- **LEFT (1,0)**:\n  - Leads to (1,0), which is also safe but may limit future options if the enemy moves toward it.\n- **RIGHT (3,0)**:\n  - Leads to (3,0), which is safe but may not be as advantageous as UP or LEFT.\n\n**UP and LEFT are both safe, but UP is slightly better because it keeps the snake moving upward toward the center of the board, where apples are more likely to be.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Enemy Movement Considerations**\nThe enemy is at **(4, 4)**. If the enemy moves **UP (4,5)**, it could threaten your snake if you move **UP (2,1)**. However, since the enemy is far away and no immediate collision is possible, this is not a critical concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**UP** is the safest and most strategic move for now, as it keeps the snake moving toward the center and avoids dead-ends.\n\n---\n**UP**",

If it moves UP to (4,6), it could threaten my path to (2,6) or (1,7). I should avoid giving it easy access to my future positions.\n2. **Prioritize apple reachability**: The closest apples are at (2,6) and (1,7). I need to position myself to reach them without getting trapped.\n3. **Expand my body**: Since I\u2019m currently just a head, I should grow by moving toward apples to increase my defensive space.\n4. **Avoid dead-ends**: The board is 10x10, so I should avoid corners or narrow paths where the enemy could corner me.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3-5 Moves):**\n- **Turn 3**: Move **UP** to (2,1) to avoid the bottom edge and create flexibility.\n- **Turn 4**: If (2,6) is still available, move **UP** repeatedly to reach it. If blocked, pivot toward (1,7) via **LEFT** or **UP**.\n- **Turn 5**: If the enemy moves toward (2,6), I should **LEFT** to (1,1) to avoid collision and then pivot toward (1,7).\n- **Turn 6**: If (1,7) is clear, move **UP** to (1,2), then **RIGHT** to (2,2), then **UP** to (2,3), etc., to reach it.\n- **General Rule**: Always keep at least two safe directions open (e.g., avoid moving into a position where only one safe move exists).\n\n**Enemy Prediction**:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,5) with body at (4,4). It likely wants to reach (6,4) or (8,8). If it moves **RIGHT** to (5,5), it could threaten my path to (2,6). I should monitor its movement and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Analysis (Turn 3)**\n- **Head Position**: (2,1) (after last move **UP** from (2,0)).\n- **Safe Moves**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would go to (2,0), which is off the board if we consider y=0 as the bottom edge, but the board is 0-9 in y, so (2,0) is valid. Wait, no: the board is 0-9 in y, with (0,0) at bottom-left. So (2,0) is valid, but moving **DOWN** from (2,1) would go to (2,0), which is safe but not ideal. However, the last move was **UP** from (2,0) to (2,1), so now the head is at (2,1).\n   - **UP**: (2,1) \u2192 (2,2)\n   - **DOWN**: (2,1) \u2192 (2,0) (safe but not optimal)\n   - **LEFT**: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1)\n   - **RIGHT**: (2,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n\n**Apples**:\n- (6,4), (2,6), (1,7), (8,8), (7,9) are still available (assuming no one has eaten them yet).\n\n**Enemy**:\n- Snake #0 is at (4,5) with body at (4,4). It could move toward (6,4) or (8,8). If it moves **RIGHT** to (5,5), it could block my path to (2,6) if I try to go UP repeatedly.\n\n**Best Move**:\n- **UP to (2,2)** is safe and keeps me moving toward the center, where apples are concentrated.\n- **LEFT to (1,1)** is also safe but may limit future options if the enemy moves toward (1,7).\n- **RIGHT to (3,1)** is safe but less strategic.\n\n**Decision**: **UP** to (2,2) to maximize flexibility and progress toward (2,6).\n\n---\n**UP**",

The best next move is **UP** to (2,5) to:\n  - Move closer to (2,6).\n  - Avoid the left edge (x=0) where Snake #0 might lurk.\n  - Keep multiple safe directions open (LEFT, RIGHT, UP).\n- **Turn 6**: If Snake #0 doesn\u2019t block, I\u2019ll move **UP** to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n- **Turn 7**: If (1,7) is still available, I\u2019ll move **UP** to (1,7) to secure another apple.\n- **Turn 8**: If Snake #0 moves toward (1,7), I\u2019ll pivot **LEFT** to (0,7) or **RIGHT** to (2,7) to avoid collision.\n- **General Rule**: Always leave at least two safe escape routes open. Avoid moving into positions where only one direction is safe.\n\n**Enemy Prediction**:\n- Snake #0 is likely targeting (6,4) or (8,8). If it moves **UP** to (6,6), it could threaten (2,6) if I go straight up. However, Snake #0 is 3 moves away from (2,6) via (6,6) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (2,6), which is not efficient. So it\u2019s unlikely to block me immediately.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (5,6), it could threaten (2,6) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **LEFT** to (1,6) or **RIGHT** to (3,6) to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Analysis (Turn 5)**\n- **Head Position**: (2,4) (after last move **UP** from (2,3)).\n- **Safe Moves**:\n  - **UP**: (2,4) \u2192 (2,5) (safe, moves toward (2,6)).\n  - **DOWN**: (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) (safe but not optimal; could get trapped near the bottom).\n  - **LEFT**: (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) (safe but less strategic for reaching (2,6)).\n  - **RIGHT**: (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) (safe but slower progress toward apples).\n\n**Apples**:\n- (2,6) is the closest high-value target. If I move **UP** repeatedly, I can reach it in 2 moves (from (2,4) to (2,6)).\n\n**Enemy**:\n- Snake #0 is at (6,5) with body at (5,5).

(1,7) is 2 moves away (from (2,6)), and (0,2) is 4 moves away after reaching (1,7). Prioritize this path unless Snake #0 blocks it.\n2. **Avoid Snake #0\u2019s expansion**: Snake #0 is at (7,5) with body at (7,4) and (6,4). It\u2019s likely targeting (8,8) or (6,6). If it moves **UP** to (6,6), it could threaten my path to (1,7). I need to stay flexible and avoid getting cornered.\n3. **Expand defensively**: Since I\u2019m still just a head, I should prioritize moves that keep me away from narrow paths or corners where Snake #0 could corner me. For example, avoid moving into (1,6) or (3,6) unless necessary, as Snake #0 could block from (5,5) or (6,6).\n4. **Monitor enemy movement**: Snake #0\u2019s last move was unknown, but if it\u2019s aggressive, I should avoid giving it easy access to my future positions. For example, if Snake #0 moves **UP** to (6,6), it could threaten (1,7) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **LEFT** to (0,7) or **RIGHT** to (2,7) to avoid collision.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3-5 Moves):**\n- **Turn 8**: I\u2019m at (2,6) after moving **UP** from (2,5). The best next move is **UP** to (1,6) to get closer to (1,7). If Snake #0 moves toward (1,7), I\u2019ll pivot **LEFT** to (0,7) or **RIGHT** to (2,7) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 9**: If (0,2) is still available, I\u2019ll move **DOWN** to (0,3) or **LEFT** to (0,1) to secure another apple.\n- **General Rule**: Always leave at least two safe escape routes open. Avoid moving into positions where only one direction is safe.\n\n**Enemy Prediction**:\n- Snake #0 is likely targeting (8,8) or (6,6). If it moves **UP** to (6,6), it could threaten (1,7) if I go straight up. However, Snake #0 is 3 moves away from (1,7) via (6,5) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7), which is not efficient. So it\u2019s unlikely to block me immediately.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (7,6), it could threaten (1,7) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **LEFT** to (0,7) or **RIGHT** to (2,7) to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Analysis (Turn 8)**\n- **Head Position**: (2,6) (after last move **UP** from (2,5)).\n- **Safe Moves**:\n  - **UP**: (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) (safe and moves me closer to (1,7)).\n  - **LEFT**: (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) (same as UP, but not optimal).\n  - **RIGHT**: (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) (safe but slower progress toward apples).\n  - **DOWN**: (2,6) \u2192 (2,5) (safe but not optimal; could get trapped near the bottom).\n\n**Apples**:\n- (1,7) is the closest high-value target. Moving **UP** to (1,6) is the best immediate move to get closer to it.\n\n**Enemy**:\n- Snake #0 is at (7,5) with body at (7,4) and (6,4). If it moves **UP** to (6,5), it could threaten my path to (1,7) if I go straight up.

In this case, I should pivot **LEFT** to (0,7) or **RIGHT** to (2,7) to avoid collision.\n\n**Best Move**:\n- **UP to (1,6)** is the safest and most strategic choice.

It\u2019s likely targeting (8,8) or (6,6). If it moves **UP** to (6,6), it could threaten my path to (0,2) if I go straight up. I must stay flexible and avoid getting trapped near the left edge.\n3. **Expand defensively**: Since I\u2019m still just a head, I should prioritize moves that keep me away from narrow paths or corners where Snake #0 could corner me. For example, avoid moving into (0,6) unless necessary, as Snake #0 could block from (0,5) or (1,5).\n4. **Monitor enemy movement**: Snake #0\u2019s last move was unknown, but if it\u2019s aggressive, I should avoid giving it easy access to my future positions. For example, if Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (6,8), it could threaten (0,2) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **DOWN** to (1,5) or **RIGHT** to (2,6) to avoid collision.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3-5 Moves):**\n- **Turn 11**: I\u2019m at (1,9) after last move **LEFT** from (2,9). The best next move is **DOWN** to (1,8) to avoid Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion upward and to position myself closer to (1,7) or (0,2).\n- **Turn 12**: If (1,7) is still available, I\u2019ll move **DOWN** to (1,7) to secure another apple.

If it moves **UP** to (6,8), it could threaten my path to (0,2) if I go straight up. I should stay flexible and avoid moving into positions where Snake #0 could block me.\n3. **Expand defensively**: Since my snake is still small (only 2 segments), I should prioritize moves that keep me away from narrow paths or corners where Snake #0 could block me.

Snake #0 is currently at (8,8) with a long body extending upward, but it\u2019s unlikely to block (0,2) immediately. However, I must avoid getting trapped near the top-left corner where Snake #0 could corner me.\n2. **Avoid Snake #0\u2019s expansion**: Snake #0 is likely targeting (6,8) or (8,7) next. If it moves **UP** to (6,8), it could threaten my path to (0,2) if I go straight up. I should stay flexible and avoid moving into positions where Snake #0 could block me.\n3. **Expand defensively**: Since my snake is still small (only 2 segments), I should prioritize moves that keep me away from narrow paths or corners where Snake #0 could block me. For example, avoid moving into (0,6) unless necessary, as Snake #0 could block from (0,5) or (1,5).\n4. **Monitor enemy movement**: Snake #0\u2019s last move was unknown, but if it\u2019s aggressive, I should avoid giving it easy access to my future positions. For example, if Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (6,7), it could threaten (0,2) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **DOWN** to (1,5) or **RIGHT** to (2,6) to avoid collision.\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3-5 Moves):**\n- **Turn 19**: Move **UP** to (0,3) to position myself closer to (0,2). This keeps me away from Snake #0\u2019s potential expansion near (8,8).\n- **Turn 20**: If (0,2) is still clear, move **UP** to (0,2) to secure it. If Snake #0 is blocking, pivot **RIGHT** to (1,1) or **DOWN** to (0,4) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 21**: If (0,2) is secured, consider moving toward (1,1) or (2,7) to avoid being cornered by Snake #0\u2019s expansion.\n- **General Rule**: Always leave at least two safe escape routes open. Avoid moving into positions where only one direction is safe.\n\n**Enemy Prediction**:\n- Snake #0 is likely targeting (8,8) or (6,6). If it moves **UP** to (6,8), it could threaten (0,2) if I go straight up. However, Snake #0 is 6 moves away from (0,2) via (6,7) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2), which is inefficient. So it\u2019s unlikely to block me immediately.\n- If Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (6,7), it could threaten (0,2) if I go straight up. In this case, I should pivot **DOWN** to (1,5) or **RIGHT** to (1,6) to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Analysis (Turn 19)**\n- **Head Position**: (0,3) (after last move **DOWN** from (0,4)).\n- **Safe Moves**:\n  - **UP**: (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) (safe and reaches the apple at (0,2)).\n  - **DOWN**: (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) (same as UP, but redundant since (0,2) is the target).\n  - **LEFT**: (0,3) \u2192 (-1,3) (invalid, off the board).\n  - **RIGHT**: (0,3) \u2192 (1,3) (safe and could pivot toward (1,1) or (2,3)).\n\n**Apples**:\n- (0,2) is reachable via **UP** to (0,2). This is the most efficient path.\n- (1,1) is also reachable but requires more moves and is not as high-priority as (0,2).\n\n**Enemy**:\n- Snake #0 is at (8,8) with body at (8,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7). It\u2019s unlikely to block (0,2) immediately, but I should avoid moving into positions where Snake #0 could corner me.\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (6,8), it could threaten (0,2) if I go straight up. However, Snake #0 is not in a position to block me yet.\n\n**Best Move**:\n- **UP to (0,2)** is the safest and most strategic choice. It:\n  - Secures the apple at (0,2).\n  - Keeps me away from the top edge (y=9) where Snake #0 might lurk.\n  - Leaves multiple safe directions open (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n**Alternative Consideration**:\n- If I move **RIGHT to (1,3)**, I could pivot toward (1,1) or (2,3) next, but this is less efficient for reaching (0,2).\n- Moving **DOWN to (0,2)** is redundant since (0,2) is the target.\n\n**Final Decision**: **UP** to (0,2) is the best move for progress and safety.\n\n---\n**UP**",

Possible moves:\n\n- UP to (9,4): Into my own body (the cell directly behind my head), which is fatal.\n- DOWN to (9,2): On board, empty, safe, and moves me closer to the apple at (9,0).\n- LEFT to (8,3): On board, empty, safe, but doesn't lead to an immediate apple.\n- RIGHT to (10,3): Off the board, fatal.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT. DOWN is optimal as it advances toward the apple at (9,0), allowing me to eat it next turn and grow to 7 apples, maintaining my lead. This aligns with prioritizing edge paths while monitoring the enemy.\n\n**START PLAN**  \nEat the apple at (9,0) this turn by going DOWN, growing to 7 apples, then continue toward (2,7) via the right edge (e.g., after eating, reassess to move left along the bottom or up). Avoid Snake #1 by staying on the edge for open options.  \n**END PLAN**\n\nDOWN",
