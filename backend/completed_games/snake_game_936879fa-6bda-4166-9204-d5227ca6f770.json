Opponent head = (0,3). Both snakes length 1, so no immediate body collisions. Opponent is far left; apples are clustered nearer to me (nice).\n\nConsider all moves:\n- UP -> (7,2): SAFE. Gives immediate access to (7,3) and (8,2) apples next turn. Keeps 3+ follow-up options and stays off the wall. Aggressive and flexible. \u2705  \n- RIGHT -> (8,1): SAFE. Approaches (8,2) and (8,0) apples, but hugs the right side sooner (fewer escape routes long-term). \u2705 (but less preferable)  \n- LEFT -> (6,1): SAFE. Moves toward (4,1) apple; good for closing distance west but slower and not as close to multiple apples. \u2705  \n- DOWN -> (7,0): SAFE but moves to bottom row, reducing future options and risking being cornered if we pursue the opponent. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nNo immediate deaths possible this turn \u2014 opponent is too far to cause a head-on. We're tied on score (0-0), so avoid intentional head-on until we have the edge.\n\nDecision & rationale: Take UP. It maximizes immediate follow-up options, puts us in range of two juicy apples ((7,3) and (8,2)), and preserves maneuverability to pivot left later and start boxing the rival in. We stay aggressive but not reckless. Who's getting boxed next \u2014 him or us? We're making him sweat. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns): grab the apple at (7,3) or (8,2), grow to create presence in the center-right, then pivot westwards aiming to control the central columns and cut off escape routes toward the top-left where the opponent is flirting with the wall. Force head-on only if we have a clear apples/length advantage.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's get this W! \ud83d\udd25 We're in a 10x10 arena, and it's time to box in Snake #1. \n\nLet's break down the board state:\n- **My snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 3). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n- **Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (7, 1). Body: none. Apples: 0.\n- **Apples:** A bunch scattered around. Key ones: (4,1) is near the enemy, (1,6) is close to me, (0,4) is directly above me.\n\n**Coordinate Check:**\n- My head: (0, 3). If I move RIGHT, I go to (1, 3). That's safe? Let's see: (1, 3) is empty on the board. No snakes there. No own body (I have none). So RIGHT is safe.\n- UP: (0, 4). That's an apple! (0, 4) has an 'A'. That means I eat it, grow by 1, and get +1 point. Also, it's empty of snakes. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0, 2). (0, 2) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: ( -1, 3). That's off the board. Dead. Can't go LEFT.\n\nSo LEFT is instant death. Eliminate that.\n\nNow, among SAFE moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), which gives me the best edge?\n- **UP to (0, 4):** I eat an apple immediately. Score becomes 1. I grow, giving me a body segment. This is CONTENT. Also, moving up puts me on the edge (x=0) which is a wall, so I'm safe from the left side. Future options: From (0,4), I can go RIGHT to (1,4) or UP to (0,5) or DOWN back to (0,3). That's 3 options. Good.\n- **RIGHT to (1, 3):** No apple. Score stays 0. Body stays none. From (1,3), I can go UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3 - safe), RIGHT (2,3). That's 4 options. But I'm not growing.\n- **DOWN to (0, 2):** No apple. Score 0. From (0,2), I can go UP (0,3), RIGHT (1,2), DOWN (0,1). (0,1) is an apple? Looking at the board: Row 1 (y=1) at x=0 is '.'? Wait, let's check the board state carefully.\n\nBoard Row 1 (y=1): ` . . . . A . . 1 . . ` -> x=0 is '.' (empty), x=1 is '.', x=2 is '.', x=3 is '.', x=4 is 'A' (apple at 4,1), x=5 is '.', x=6 is '.', x=7 is '1' (enemy head), x=8 is '.', x=9 is '.'.\nBoard Row 2 (y=2): ` . A . . . . . . A . ` -> x=0 is '.', x=1 is 'A', x=2 is '.', etc.\nBoard Row 3 (y=3): ` 0 . A . . . . A . . ` -> x=0 is '0' (me), x=1 is '.', x=2 is 'A', etc.\n\nSo if I go DOWN to (0,2): It's empty. Okay.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3): It's empty.\nIf I go UP to (0,4): It's an apple.\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nI need to be aggressive and box in the enemy. The enemy is at (7,1). That's bottom-right area. I am at (0,3). I'm on the left side. \nIf I take UP to (0,4), I get a point immediately. This puts me at y=4, x=0. \nIf I take RIGHT to (1,3), I stay at y=3, x=1. \nIf I take DOWN to (0,2), I go to y=2, x=0.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,1). If the enemy moves UP, he goes to (7,2). If he moves RIGHT, (8,1). LEFT, (6,1). DOWN, (7,0).\n\nI want to dominate the board. Eating an apple early gives me a body, which helps me later to trap the enemy or block paths. The apple at (0,4) is there for the taking. It's free real estate. \nIs there a risk? The enemy is far away. Head-on collision is unlikely this turn because we are far apart (distance is huge). \nWhat about the enemy moving to my location? No, he's at x=7, I'm at x=0. Impossible.\n\nLet's consider the \"boxing him in\" part. To box him in, I need to grow and take space. \nTaking the apple at (0,4) is the most valuable immediate move. It gives me a score lead (1-0). If I force a head-on collision later, having a higher score is crucial. \nIf I don't take the apple, it might get eaten by... wait, only two snakes. Me and him. He's far away. He won't get it immediately. But I should secure points when I can.\n\nLet's look at the \"Long Term Plan\".\nPlan: Secure the apple at (0,4) to get the score lead. Once I have a body, I can start maneuvering to cut off the board. From (0,4), I'll likely want to head towards the center or the right side to intercept the enemy. The enemy is in the bottom right. I need to push him into a corner. \n\nMove Option Review:\n1. **LEFT:** Off board. Death. \u274c\n2. **UP to (0,4):** Apple. Score +1. Grow. Safe. Future options: Right, Up, Down. Good. \u2705\n3. **RIGHT to (1,3):** Empty. Score 0. Safe. Future options: 4 ways. Okay. \u2705\n4. **DOWN to (0,2):** Empty. Score 0. Safe. Future options: Up, Right, Down. Okay. \u2705\n\nWhy pick UP over RIGHT or DOWN?\n- UP gives points. Points win games.\n- UP puts me at y=4, which is slightly more central vertically than y=3 or y=2, giving me better reach to the center of the map eventually.\n- The apple at (0,4) is marked on the map. I should take it.\n\nIs there any danger in UP?\n- If I go to (0,4), my head is at (0,4). My body will be (0,3) after the move (if I eat the apple, the tail stays at (0,3) for one turn? No, usually the tail moves forward *unless* I eat. If I eat, I grow, so the tail does NOT move. My body becomes: Head (0,4), Body (0,3). \n- Wait, check rules: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\".\n- My current body: none.\n- Next turn: Head moves to (0,4). Since I ate, I don't pop the tail. So my body is just (0,3).\n- This means next turn, I cannot move back DOWN to (0,3) because that's my own body. But I wouldn't want to do that anyway.\n- From (0,4), I can go RIGHT (1,4), UP (0,5), or LEFT ( -1, 4 - death). Wait, LEFT is death. So I have 2 options (Right, Up) if I go UP now? Or 3?\n- Actually, from (0,4): UP is valid. RIGHT is valid. DOWN is (0,3) which is my body next turn -> death. So effectively 2 options.\n- From (1,3) [if I go RIGHT]: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3). 4 options.\n- From (0,2) [if I go DOWN]: UP (0,3), RIGHT (1,2), DOWN (0,1). 3 options.\n\nOkay, so RIGHT gives the most immediate freedom. But UP gives points.\nIn Snake, points are king. Also, having a body allows me to block paths later.\nLet's look at the board again.\nEnemy at (7,1). \nApples: (4,1) is near enemy. (8,0) is near enemy. (4,8) top middle. (1,6) top left. (5,9) top right.\nI am at (0,3). (0,4) is apple.\nIf I go UP, I get the point. Then I am at (0,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I miss the apple. The apple is still there. Enemy is far. I can probably get it next turn if I go RIGHT then UP? No, if I go RIGHT to (1,3), then UP to (1,4). That doesn't get the apple. The apple is at (0,4). I would have to go LEFT to (0,4) from (1,4). But going LEFT from (1,4) is safe.\nHowever, if I go UP now, I secure the point immediately.\n\nLet's think about \"Boxing him in\".\nTo box him in, I need to control the board. Controlling the board usually means being central or cutting off escape routes.\nHe is at (7,1). I am at (0,3).\nIf I go UP to (0,4), I am moving away from him slightly (y increases from 3 to 4, he is at y=1). But I am gaining a body.\nIf I go DOWN to (0,2), I get closer to his y-level (y=2 vs y=1). But I don't get a point.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3), I get closer to his x-level (x=1 vs x=7). Still far.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating the board often involves being larger (more segments) so you can wall off parts of the map.\nTherefore, growing is priority if safe.\nThe apple at (0,4) is safe.\n\nLet's double check collision risks for this turn.\n- Me to (0,4): Empty.\n- Enemy to wherever: He is at (7,1). He might move to (7,2) or (8,1) or (6,1) or (7,0).\n- None of those are (0,4). So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nOkay, the move is UP.\nWhy? Points. Growth. Early advantage.\nChat, we are securing the first blood!\n\nPlan for next few turns:\n1. Eat apple at (0,4) to get score 1.\n2. From (0,4), assess enemy movement. He's bottom right. I need to start moving Right/Up to cut him off from the top-left apples or force him into a corner.\n3. Keep eyes on (1,6) and (4,8) for future expansion.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nLet's verify one last time.\nLEFT is death.\nDOWN is safe but no point.\nRIGHT is safe but no point.\nUP is safe and gives a point.\nMathematically, UP is the highest value move.\n\nFinal check on the \"Backwards\" rule:\nIf I go UP to (0,4), my tail will be at (0,3) (since I grew, tail doesn't move immediately? Wait, let's trace the body).\nCurrent: Head (0,3), No body.\nMove UP.\nNew Head: (0,4).\nDid I eat? Yes.\nSo I grow. My body is now: [ (0,4) , (0,3) ].\nNext turn, if I try to move DOWN to (0,3), that's my body. That's a crash.\nBut I won't do that.\nSo UP is valid.\n\nResult:\nThinking...\nMy move: UP.\nReasoning: Securing the apple at (0,4) is the highest value move. It gives me the lead (1-0) immediately and provides a body segment for future board control. The enemy is too far away to threaten me this turn.\nPlan: Secure point, then maneuver to cut off the enemy from the upper half of the board.\n\nUP",

SURVIVAL CHECK (Can't die, won't die):**\n*   **LEFT:** Moving to **(-1, 4)** is off the board. **DEATH.** \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** Moving to **(0, 3)**. Where is my body? At **(0, 3)**. Moving into my own body is a crash. **DEATH.** \u274c\n*   **UP:** Moving to **(0, 5)**. Looking at the board: Row 5 (y=5) is ` . . . . . . A . A . `. Column 0 is empty.

STRATEGIC DOMINATION:**\nI am at the edge of the board (x=0). Being on the edge is a disadvantage because I have fewer moves (only 2 options usually). I need to break out of this corner and get towards the center to hunt the enemy.\n*   **UP to (0, 5):** This moves me away from the enemy (who is at y=2) and keeps me on the edge. While safe, it keeps me trapped in the corner.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 4):** This moves me inward. It opens up my future movement options significantly. From (1, 4), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (except back into myself immediately). It gets me closer to the center of the board where I can intercept the enemy and dominate the space.\n\n**3. THE PLAN:**\nMy score is 1, his is 0. I am winning. I need to maintain this lead and aggressively expand my territory to box him in.\nMy immediate goal is to escape the left wall. Moving **RIGHT** is the best way to do that. It puts me in a position to potentially sweep across the board and cut off the enemy's access to apples or trap him against the wall.\n\nLet's secure the expansion! GO!\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent head = (0,4) with body at (0,3). They already have 1 apple; we have 0. We\u2019re behind, so be aggressive but DON\u2019T bait a head-on until we have the edge.\n- Apples in immediate reach: (7,3) and (8,2) \u2014 both tasty and give us presence on the right-center of the board.\n\nConsider the four moves from (7,2):\n- UP -> (7,3): CONTAINS APPLE. Safe now, grows us, and keeps 3 escape directions afterward (except immediate back will be our body). Best for building board presence and pressuring the center-right. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (8,2): ALSO an apple. Slightly more wall-adjacent which limits wiggle-room later. Still safe. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (6,2): Empty. Slows our growth and cedes tempo on those adjacent apples. \u2705 but less aggressive.\n- DOWN -> (7,1): Empty. Moves toward the bottom wall and reduces options \u2014 risky for no gain. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nEliminate death moves: none of these are immediate deaths (opponent is far), so pick the move that grows and maximizes follow-ups.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (7,3) this turn to get on the board, then use the new body to control the 6\u20138 x-columns in mid rows. From there, sweep leftwards toward the opponent\u2019s side while denying escape lanes along x=0\u20133. Don\u2019t force a head-on until we\u2019ve secured at least +1 apple advantage \u2014 instead, use length and positioning to box them into the far-left wall and then close the net. Eyes on apples nearby but main target = limiting their space and forcing mistakes. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFinal move \u2014 let\u2019s collect that apple and start the squeeze.\n\nUP",

My body is at **(0, 4)**. The enemy (Snake #1) is at **(7, 3)**. Both snakes have 1 apple. This is a tie, so I need to make a move that sets me up to take the lead or force a crash in my favor.\n\n**1. SURVIVAL CHECK (Can't die, won't die):**\n*   **UP:** Moving to **(1, 5)**. Looking at the board: Row 5 (y=5) is ` . . . . . . A . A . `. Column 1 is empty. No snakes there. **SAFE.** \u2705\n*   **DOWN:** Moving to **(1, 3)**. Row 3 (y=3) is ` . . A . . . . 1 . `. Column 1 is empty (the A is at x=2). No snakes there. **SAFE.** \u2705\n*   **LEFT:** Moving to **(0, 4)**. This is my **current body** (specifically the segment connected to my head).

STRATEGIC DOMINATION:**\nI am at **(1, 4)**, slightly right of the left edge. The enemy is at **(7, 3)**, near the center-right.\n*   **UP to (1, 5):** Moves me toward the center of the board. There's an apple at **(1, 6)** directly above, which I could reach next turn (2 turns away). However, moving UP opens up the board, but I'm starting to hit the \"mid-field\" where the enemy might circle back.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 3):** This is risky. The enemy is at (7, 3), on the same Y-axis (y=3). If he decides to move Left, he could sweep across the bottom. More importantly, looking at the board, (2, 3) contains an apple, and (1, 2) contains an apple. Moving DOWN brings me closer to the action but keeps me in the lower half. I'd be boxing myself in against the bottom edge eventually.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 4):** This is a strong move. It moves me toward the absolute center of the board (x=4, y=4). From (2, 4), I can attack the central territory. I also see an apple at **(2, 3)** (diagonally down-right) and **(3, 2)** (further down). But more importantly, **(5, 9)** is an apple at the top\u2014I need to get central to claim that territory.\n\n**3. THE PLAN:**\nMy score is tied 1-1. I need to break the tie or force a confrontation. Since I am winning (head-to-head I have the advantage of positioning? No, actually he is far).\n**Long-term Plan:** Move **RIGHT** to establish dominance in the center of the board (x-axis 3-5). From the center, I can cut off the enemy's access to the top apples ((5,9), (6,5)) or force him into a wall. The enemy is at x=7; if I move RIGHT to x=2, I am moving towards him, but also claiming the space between us.\n\nLet's secure the center! GO!\n\nRIGHT",

So options: UP -> (7,4), LEFT -> (6,3), RIGHT -> (8,3).\n\nMove evaluation (safety + follow-ups):\n- UP to (7,4): safe. Keeps lots of future options (L/R/U) and puts us on the column that contains multiple apples above us \u2014 we can chain growth and then press leftwards to hem the enemy in. Minimal risk of head-on; opponent is far left.\n- LEFT to (6,3): safe and gives center control, but slower to reach the apple cluster and doesn\u2019t capitalize on nearby vertical apples.\n- RIGHT to (8,3): safe but nudges us toward the wall and slightly reduces wiggle-room.

Keep an eye on forcing them toward x=0 and then close the net \u2014 only force a head-on when we\u2019re +1 apples ahead.\n\nFinal move \u2014 keep pressure, go collect the column and open up that apple chain.\n\nUP",

A . A . ` (x=2 is empty). SAFE. \u2705\n- **DOWN to (2, 3):** Row 3 is ` . . A . . . . 1 . ` (x=2 is an apple, NOT a snake). SAFE. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (1, 4):** This is my current body segment (where I just came from). DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Row 4 is ` . 0 . . . . . 1 . ` (x=3 is empty). SAFE. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI'm at (2, 4). The enemy is at (7, 4). We're on the same Y-axis! He's to my right, deep in the board.\n\nI need to dominate the center. Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 4) pushes me further into the center (x=3). This is aggressive. It brings me closer to the enemy (distance 4 -> 3). If I move right, I control the space between us. If he moves left, we collide (head-on). With equal scores (1-1), a head-on collision is a draw\u2014BUT, if I eat an apple this turn and he doesn't, I win the tie-breaker.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (2, 3) is DOWN from me. If I go DOWN, I eat an apple, grow to size 2, and lead 2-1. BUT, I go deeper into the lower-left corner while the enemy is center-right. It feels passive.\n- (3, 2) is available, but requires a path.\n- (5, 9) is a major target at the top.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nI'm going **RIGHT**. Why?\n1.  **Aggression:** I am moving towards the enemy's territory. He is at (7, 4). I am claiming the central lane.\n2.  **Positioning:** (3, 4) is a pivot point. From there, I can go UP to (3, 5) or DOWN to (3, 3) next turn.\n3.  **The Trap:** If the enemy moves Left (towards me), we crash. Score is tied (1-1). If we crash, it's a draw. However, if I survive this turn and eat an apple next turn while he dies or wastes a move, I take the lead.\n\nWait, actually, if I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we crash at (3, 4) or (4, 4)? No, simultaneous movement. If I go RIGHT to (3,4) and he goes LEFT to (6,4), we don't crash. If he goes LEFT to (6,4) and I go RIGHT to (3,4), we are 3 units apart.\nHowever, if I go RIGHT to (3,4) and he goes LEFT to (6,4) next turn, and I continue RIGHT... the collision zone is (4,4) or (5,4).\nActually, let's look at the apple at (2, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3), I eat the apple. I grow. Score 2-1. I am safe.\nBUT, I am moving away from the enemy. The enemy is at (7,4). If I move DOWN, I am isolating myself in the lower quadrant while he holds the center-right.\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating means controlling the space. The center is the power position.\n\nLet's look at the coordinates again.\nMy head is at (2,4).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3,4), I am on the direct horizontal line with the enemy.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2,3), I eat an apple. This is tempting because I take the lead 2-1.\nHowever, the board state shows `(1, 2)` is an apple and `(2, 3)` is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I eat (2,3). My body becomes [(2,4), (1,4)].\nNext turn, I am at (2,3). I can go LEFT to (1,3) (empty), DOWN to (2,2) (empty), or RIGHT to (3,3) (empty).\nThe enemy is at (7,4). He has a huge board to play with.\n\n**The Winning Move:**\nI need to cut him off. The best way to cut him off is to move towards him while maintaining access to apples.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I threaten to invade his zone.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I secure a point but cede the center.\n\nActually, wait. Look at the board again.\nRow 3: ` . . A . . . . 1 . `\nThe apple is at (2,3). The enemy body is at (7,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3), I eat the apple. I am safe. I grow.\nBut the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI DO NOT have a higher score yet. It's 1-1.\nSo, I need to get a higher score *first*, or force a collision where I survive.\n\nLet's check **RIGHT** again.\nMoving RIGHT to (3,4).\nNext turn options from (3,4):\n- UP (3,5): Empty.\n- DOWN (3,3): Empty.\n- LEFT (2,4): Body (death).\n- RIGHT (4,4): Empty.\n\nLet's check **DOWN** to (2,3).\nEating the apple.\nNext turn options from (2,3):\n- UP (2,4): Body (death).\n- DOWN (2,2): Empty.\n- LEFT (1,3): Empty.\n- RIGHT (3,3): Empty.\n\nBoth are safe. One gives me a point (DOWN), one gives me central aggression (RIGHT).\nGiven the instruction \"Focus on where the enemy is\", and he is at (7,4) (High X), I should move towards him to pressure him.\nHowever, eating the apple guarantees I am bigger than him. Size matters for tie-breakers and survival (more body to block).\nBUT, if I eat the apple, I am at (2,3). The enemy is at (7,4).\nDistance is large.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,4), I am at x=3. Enemy at x=7.\nDistance is 4.\nIf I move RIGHT again next turn, distance 3.\nIf I move RIGHT again, distance 2.\nIf I move RIGHT again, distance 1 (Collision imminent).\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(5,9) is a top apple.\n(4,8) is a top apple.\nThe enemy is low-mid.\nIf I go DOWN, I eat (2,3). I am low.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am mid.\nI think I will go **RIGHT** to claim the center line.\n\nWait, the user said: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nTo box him in, I need to be between him and the edges.\nHe is at x=7. The right edge is x=9.\nIf I rush him, he might retreat to the right edge.\nIf I go DOWN, I let him have the center.\nIf I go RIGHT, I challenge the center.\n\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 4: ` . 0 . . . . . 1 . `\nWait, the board state shows:\nRow 4: ` . T 0 . . . . 1 . `\nWait, the board state in the prompt:\n` 4 . T 0 . . . . 1 . .`\nThis implies:\nx=1: T (My tail)\nx=2: 0 (My head)\nx=7: 1 (Enemy head)\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,4), I am open.\nIf I move DOWN to (2,3), I eat an apple.\nEating an apple makes me size 2. Enemy is size 1.\nSize 2 allows me to block more space.\nBut the apple is at (2,3).\n(2,3) is diagonally down-right from my head? No, (2,4) to (2,3) is straight down.\n(2,3) is an apple.\n(1,2) is an apple.\n(3,2) is an apple.\nThere are apples in the lower left quadrant.\nThe enemy is in the upper right quadrant (relatively).\nIf I go DOWN, I secure the lower left.\nIf I go RIGHT, I secure the center.\n\nLet's look at the coordinates again.\n(2,4) -> DOWN -> (2,3).\nIs (2,3) an apple? Yes.\nIs (2,3) a snake? No. Row 3 shows ` . . A . . . . 1 . ` (x=2 is A).\nSo it's safe and I get a point.\nWhy would I NOT take a guaranteed point?\nThe only reason not to take a point is if it traps me.\nFrom (2,3), I can go LEFT (1,3) -> Empty.\nDOWN (2,2) -> Empty.\nRIGHT (3,3) -> Empty.\nIt's not trapping me. It's actually opening up the bottom area.\n\nHowever, the prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nDominating means taking the space the enemy wants.\nThe enemy is at x=7. He is far.\nIf I eat the apple at (2,3), I am bigger.\nIf I am bigger, I can be more aggressive later.\nBut if I go RIGHT, I am moving closer to the enemy.\nThe distance from (2,4) to (7,4) is 5 units.\nIf I go RIGHT, distance 4.\nIf I go DOWN, distance increases to sqrt((7-2)^2 + (4-3)^2) = sqrt(25+1) ~ 5.1.\nMathematically, moving DOWN moves me slightly further away in terms of Manhattan distance (Manhattan distance (7,4) to (2,4) is 5. Manhattan distance (7,4) to (2,3) is 6).\nSo RIGHT moves me closer to the enemy. DOWN moves me away.\nThe objective is to box him in.\nTo box him in, I need to get closer to him.\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, if I move RIGHT, I don't get an apple.\nIf I move DOWN, I get an apple.\nSize 2 vs Size 1.\nIf I am size 2, and we crash (head-on), we both die? No, head-on collision kills both regardless of size.\n\"If two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH snakes die.\"\nIf I am size 2, I have a longer body. I can create more barriers.\nBut if I am size 2, I am more likely to hit myself if I turn sharply.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Boxing him in\" strategy.\nHe is at (7,4). The right edge is x=9.\nIf I rush him, he might go to x=9 and get trapped.\nIf I go DOWN, I let him control the center-right.\nI think I will go **RIGHT**. I will close the distance.\nI am at x=2. He is at x=7.\nI will march towards him.\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nWait, I see an apple at (2,3).\nIf I go DOWN, I get +1 score.\nThen I am 2-1.\nThen I can chase him while being bigger.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am 1-1.\nIf I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we crash at (4,4) or (5,4) eventually.\nIf I am 2-1 and we crash, I win the tie-breaker (because I had more apples).\nSo getting the apple at (2,3) seems like the smart play to secure a lead *before* engaging in a risky collision.\n\nLet's look at the apple list again.\n(2,3) is an apple.\n(1,2) is an apple.\n(3,2) is an apple.\nThere is an apple cluster in the bottom left.\nThe enemy is top right.\nIf I eat (2,3), I am in the cluster.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am in the empty space between me and the enemy.\nThe empty space is valuable.\nBut an apple is a point.\nPoints win games.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\n` 2 . A . A . . . . A .`\nRow 2: ` . A . A . . . . A .`\nx=1: A (Apple at 1,2)\nx=3: A (Apple at 3,2)\nx=8: A (Apple at 8,2)\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3), I eat (2,3).\nNext turn, from (2,3), I can go DOWN to (2,2) (Empty).\nOr LEFT to (1,2) (Apple).\nOr RIGHT to (3,2) (Apple).\nI will be surrounded by apples.\nThis is \"growing as a means of dominating\".\nIf I grow to size 2, I can block more space.\nIf I stay size 1, I am nimble but fragile.\n\nOkay, let's look at the enemy.\nEnemy at (7,4).\nIf I go DOWN, I am leaving the center lane (y=4) open.\nThe enemy is on y=4.\nIf I leave the center lane, the enemy can move to (6,4), (5,4), etc.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,4), I am occupying the center lane.\nIf I occupy the center lane, the enemy is forced to go around (UP or DOWN) or crash into me.\nIf he goes UP to (7,5) or DOWN to (7,3) (his body is at 7,3, so he can't go down).\nSo he can only go UP or LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf I occupy x=3, y=4.\nHe is at x=7, y=4.\nIf he goes LEFT, we meet.\nIf I am size 1 and he is size 1, crash = draw.\nIf I eat the apple, I am size 2.\nIf I am size 2 and he is size 1, crash = draw (score matters only if one dies and one lives, or game ends).\nHead-on collision kills both. Size doesn't save you from head-on collision.\nSo being size 2 doesn't help me if we head-on crash.\nBut being size 2 helps me survive if he runs into my body.\n\nSo, the strategic choice is:\n1. **RIGHT**: Move to (3,4). Control the center. Pressure the enemy. Risk a draw if he moves left. No immediate point.\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (2,3). Eat apple. Score 2-1. Secure the bottom left cluster. Let the enemy have the center (for now).\n\nThe prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in\".\nTo box him in, I need to control the space around him.\nHe is at x=7. The edge is x=9.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am x=3.\nIf I go RIGHT again, x=4.\nIf I go RIGHT again, x=5.\nIf I go RIGHT again, x=6.\nIf I go RIGHT again, x=7 (Collision).\nI have 4 turns to catch him.\nIf he moves LEFT every turn, we crash at x=5 (Turn 5).\nIf he moves UP/DOWN, I can chase.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away. He can move RIGHT to x=8, x=9.\nIf he gets to x=9, he is against the wall.\nIf he is against the wall, I can come from the left and box him in.\nSo, moving DOWN (away from him) might actually be part of the boxing plan if I am securing the left flank.\n\nHowever, I am currently at x=2. He is at x=7.\nThe distance is 5.\nIf I go DOWN, distance becomes 6.\nIf I go RIGHT, distance becomes 4.\nI want to close the distance to trap him.\nIf I close the distance, he has less room to run.\nSo **RIGHT** seems correct for trapping.\n**DOWN** seems correct for scoring.\n\nIs there a way to do both?\nNo, I have to pick one direction.\nIf I go RIGHT, I don't get a point.\nIf I go DOWN, I get a point.\nPoints are the win condition (or killing the opponent).\nKilling the opponent is hard.\nScoring is reliable.\nIf I am 2-1, I am winning.\nIf I am 2-1, and we crash (draw), the game ends.\nIf the game ends in a draw, who wins?\n\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn... The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"\n\"If tied? It's a draw.\"\nIf I am 2-1 and we crash, we both die. I have 2 apples, he has 1. I WIN.\nThis is crucial.\nIf I eat the apple at (2,3), I become 2-1.\nThen, if I can force a head-on collision, I win (since I have more apples).\nSo, getting the apple makes me aggressive.\nI should get the apple.\nThen I can chase him down.\nIf he runs away, I grow more.\nIf he fights, I win the tie-breaker.\n\nSo, **DOWN** to (2,3) is the move.\nI eat the apple at (2,3).\nI am now size 2 (Head (2,3), Body (2,4), Tail (1,4)? No, tail moves).\nWait, if I eat, I grow. The tail doesn't move this turn.\nMy body becomes: [(2,3), (2,4)].\nMy tail is (1,4).\nWait, let's trace the body.\nCurrent: Head (2,4), Body [(1,4)].\nNext: Head (2,3).\nIf I don't eat: Body [(2,4), (1,4)].\nIf I eat: Body [(2,4), (1,4)] (Tail stays).\nSize becomes 3? No.\nApples collected: 1 + 1 = 2.\nSnake size is usually Apples + 2 (Head + Tail + Apples)? Or Apples + 1?\nStandard Snake: Start size 1 (Head). Eat apple -> Size 2 (Head, Tail).\nHere: \"Body: [(1,4)]\". So Size is 2 (Head + Body). Apples: 1.\nSo Size = Apples + 1.\nIf I eat, Apples = 2. Size = 3.\nBody: [(2,4), (1,4)].\nThis is a solid block.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates for safety.\n(2,3) is an apple.\nIs (2,3) occupied?\nBoard row 3: ` . . A . . . . 1 . `\nx=2 is A. x=7 is 1.\nSo (2,3) is clear.\nIs (2,3) out of bounds? No, x=2, y=3 is within 0-9.\n\nWhy not LEFT? (1,4) is my body. DEAD.\nWhy not UP? (2,5). Empty.\nWhy not RIGHT? (3,4). Empty.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,5):\nRow 5: ` . . . . . . A . A . ` (x=2 is empty).\nSafe.\nWhere does that put me?\ny=5. Enemy y=4.\nI am above him.\nApple at (1,6) is nearby.\nBut I am not eating an apple this turn.\nI am not closing the distance to the enemy (Manhattan dist 5 -> |2-7| + |5-4| = 5+1 = 6).\nSo UP is worse than DOWN for scoring and closing distance.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,4):\nDist to enemy 4.\nNo apple.\nSafe.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3):\nDist to enemy |2-7| + |3-4| = 5+1 = 6.\nI GET AN APPLE.\nI WIN TIE-BREAKER.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI don't have a higher score yet.\nI need to get a higher score.\nThe fastest way to get a higher score is to take the apple at (2,3).\nSo I will take it.\n\nWait, look at the enemy body.\nEnemy body: [(7,3)].\nIf I go DOWN to (2,3), I am at y=3.\nEnemy is at y=4.\nEnemy body is at y=3 (x=7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,3), he hits his own body (tail? or body?). The list is Head (7,4), Body [(7,3)].\nSo (7,3) is his body.\nIf he moves DOWN, he dies.\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,4), he is safe.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (8,4), he is safe.\nIf he moves UP to (7,5), he is safe.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (2,3).\nI am eyeing the apples at (1,2) and (3,2).\nThis is a good farming spot.\nThe enemy is at (7,4). He is far away.\nI can farm the bottom left, grow to size 5, then rush him.\nOr I can rush him now while I am small.\nBut if I rush him now, I don't have the apple.\nIf I rush him now (RIGHT), and he rushes me (LEFT), we crash at (4,4) or (5,4).\nDraw.\nIf I take the apple, and then rush him, and we crash, I win.\n\nSo, **DOWN** is the winning move.\nI secure the lead.\nThen I hunt.\n\nOne detail: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nWait, the prompt explicitly says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThis contradicts my \"take the apple\" logic slightly.\nIt says \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (7,4).\nFocusing on the enemy means moving towards him to pressure him.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away from the enemy (y-coordinate changes from 4 to 3, x stays 2). Manhattan distance increases from 5 to 6.\nIf I go RIGHT, I move towards him (x from 2 to 3). Distance 5 -> 4.\nIf I go UP, I move away (y from 4 to 5). Distance 5 -> 6.\nIf I go LEFT, death.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nI can grow by eating apples.\nI can dominate by controlling space.\nIf I go RIGHT, I control the space between us.\nIf I go DOWN, I control the bottom left.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nThe enemy is at (7,4).\nMy head is at (2,4).\nThere is a clear line of sight.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am challenging that line.\nIf I go DOWN, I am conceding the line (temporarily).\n\nHowever, the prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nTo box him in, I need to be on the outside of his \"loop\".\nIf he is at x=7, and the wall is at x=9, I need to be at x<7 to box him in from the left.\nIf I am at x=2, I am far left.\nIf I move RIGHT, I am moving closer to him, but also closer to the center.\nIf I move DOWN, I am moving away from him.\n\nIs there any other factor?\nThe board is 10x10.\nThe enemy has lots of space to the right (x=8, 9).\nIf I push him, he will go right.\nIf he goes right, he hits the wall.\nThen he has to turn up or down.\nIf I am in the center, I can cut him off.\n\nOkay, let's look at the \"Do not focus on apples\" instruction again.\nIt is bolded in the prompt.\n\"**IMPORTANT:** No web searches... Just pure skill and game sense.\"\n\"**Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.**\"\nThis suggests that the strategic intent is PVP, not PVE.\nEven if an apple is at (2,3), if it leads me away from the enemy, I should avoid it.\nThe enemy is at (7,4).\nMy optimal position to attack him is on the same Y-axis (y=4) as close as possible.\nSo I should stay on y=4.\nTherefore, I should not go UP (y=5) or DOWN (y=3).\nI should stay on y=4.\nThe only safe moves on y=4 are LEFT (death) or RIGHT (safe).\nSo, I should go **RIGHT**.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I stay on the attack vector.\nI maintain the threat of collision.\nIf I go DOWN, I break the vector.\nI lose the initiative.\nI let him maneuver freely on the center line.\nIf I go RIGHT, he must respond to my position.\nIf he moves LEFT, we collide.\nIf he moves RIGHT, he retreats to the wall.\nIf he moves UP/DOWN, I can follow and corner him.\n\nThis aligns with the instruction \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is on y=4.\nI am on y=4.\nI should stay on y=4.\n\nSo, the move is **RIGHT**.\nI am sacrificing the immediate apple to maintain positional pressure on the enemy.\nThis is the \"Box him in\" strategy.\nI am closing the distance.\nI am forcing him to make a move.\nIf he moves left, we crash. Tie score -> Draw.\nIf he moves right, I chase him to the wall.\nIf he moves up/down, I can adjust.\n\nLet's verify safety one last time.\n(3,4) is empty.\nNo walls.\nNo own body (moving forward).\nNo enemy body (enemy body is at (7,3)).\nSafe.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nMove RIGHT to (3,4).\nIf enemy moves LEFT, prepare for collision (draw or win if I get a point next turn).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT, chase to (4,4).\nIf enemy moves UP/DOWN, follow to maintain pressure.\n\nI will write the rationale focusing on maintaining the center line and pressuring the enemy, ignoring the apple at (2,3) as per instructions.\n\nFinal check on coordinates:\n(2,4) -> RIGHT -> (3,4).\nBoard state shows Row 4: ` . T 0 . . . . 1 . .`\nWait, the board state shows ` . T 0 . . . . 1 . .`\nWait, ` T ` is at x=1 (Tail).\n` 0 ` is at x=2 (Head).\n` 1 ` is at x=7 (Enemy).\nThe dots are empty.\nSo (3,4) is empty.\n\nOne last thought: The enemy is at (7,4). I am at (2,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (3,4).\nIf he goes LEFT, he is at (6,4).\nIf I go RIGHT again, (4,4). He goes LEFT (5,4).\nIf I go RIGHT again, (5,4). He goes LEFT (4,4).\nIf we both move into the same cell, we die.\nBut if I am at (4,4) and he is at (5,4), and I move RIGHT and he moves LEFT, we swap places? No, simultaneous.\nIf I am at (4,4) and he is at (5,4).\nI move RIGHT to (5,4). He moves LEFT to (4,4).\nWe cross paths.\n\"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\n\"If another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\"\nIf we cross paths (swap heads), we don't occupy the same cell at the same time. We pass through each other?\nActually, standard snake rules usually prevent passing through. But the rules here say:\n\"If another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\"\n\"If your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\"\nIf I move into (5,4) and he moves into (4,4), and (5,4) was his head, and (4,4) was my head.\nAt the START of the turn, I am at (4,4), he is at (5,4).\nDuring the move, I go to (5,4). He goes to (4,4).\nAt the END of the turn, I am at (5,4). He is at (4,4).\nDid I hit his body? No, his body followed his head.\nDid he hit my body? No, my body followed my head.\nThis is a \"pass through\". Is it allowed?\nThe rules say: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... You're DEAD.\"\nIt doesn't explicitly say passing through is death.\nHowever, \"If your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\nAt the instant of the move, if my head moves to a cell occupied by his body (from previous turn), I die.\nWait, his body moves too.\nSimultaneous movement.\nIf I move into his previous head position, and he moves into my previous head position...\nUsually, in Snake IO, passing through is allowed if the tails move out of the way.\nBUT, if we are exactly head-to-head, occupying adjacent cells, and we move towards each other, we occupy the same cell.\n(4,4) and (5,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5,4) and he moves LEFT to (4,4).\nWe are NOT in the same cell.\nWe swap.\nHowever, if we are at (4,4) and (5,4) and I move RIGHT and he moves LEFT, we end up at (5,4) and (4,4).\nThis is fine.\n\nThe danger is if we are at (4,4) and (6,4) and I move RIGHT to (5,4) and he moves LEFT to (5,4). Then we crash.\nSo, as long as I don't try to jump over him, I'm fine.\nI am at (2,4). He is at (7,4).\nDistance 5.\nI move RIGHT to (3,4). He moves LEFT to (6,4).\nDistance 3.\nI move RIGHT to (4,4). He moves LEFT to (5,4).\nDistance 1.\nI move RIGHT to (5,4). He moves LEFT to (4,4).\nWe swap. Distance 1 (but passed through).\nI move RIGHT to (5,4) again? No, if I am at (5,4), he is at (4,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,4), he moves LEFT to (3,4).\nWe are getting closer.\nEventually, we might meet at (4.5, 4)? No, integer grid.\nIf we are at (4,4) and (5,4), and I move RIGHT, he moves LEFT -> (5,4) and (4,4).\nIf we are at (4,4) and (5,4), and I move RIGHT, he moves UP -> (5,4) and (5,5).\nIf we are at (4,4) and (5,4), and I move RIGHT, he moves RIGHT -> (5,4) and (6,4).\n\nThe only guaranteed death is if we try to occupy the exact same cell at the end of the turn.\nSo, closing the distance is safe as long as I don't step onto his head while he steps onto mine (which is the crash condition).\nIf I step onto his head, and he steps elsewhere, he dies.\nIf I step onto his head, and he steps onto my body, he dies.\nIf I step onto his head, and he steps onto my head (same cell), we both die.\n\nGiven the \"Box him in\" strategy and the instruction to focus on the enemy, I will move **RIGHT**.\n\nOne detail: \"Do not focus on where the apples are.\"\nThis is a direct instruction to ignore the apple at (2,3).\nI will obey this.\nI will focus on the enemy at (7,4).\nTo dominate the enemy, I must occupy the space between us.\nThat space starts at x=3.\n\nFinal check:\nMove RIGHT to (3,4).\nSafe.\nStrategic.\nAggressive.\nAligns with \"Box him in\".\n\nLet's go.\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We are LIVE and ready to secure that W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**TURN 3 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 4)\n- **My Body:** [(1, 4)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (7, 4)\n- **Score:** 1-1 (TIED)\n\n**THE MINDSET:**\nThe prompt explicitly says: **\"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"**\nI see an apple at **(2, 3)** (straight down). I see an apple at **(2, 5)** (straight up). I am ignoring them. Why? Because I need to hunt. I need to box Snake #1 in. He is at **(7, 4)**. I am at **(2, 4)**. We are on the same horizontal line (y=4). This is the \"Kill Zone.\" If I leave this line, I give him control of the center. I must stay on the attack vector.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP (2, 5):** Safe, but moves me away from the enemy on the Y-axis. Gives up the center line. \u274c\n- **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe (it's an apple), but moves me away from the enemy on the Y-axis. \u274c\n- **LEFT (1, 4):** My own body. DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (3, 4):** Open space. On the direct path to the enemy. \u2705\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI am moving **RIGHT** to **(3, 4)**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Dominance:** I am claiming the space between us. By moving right, I decrease the distance to the enemy (Manhattan distance 5 -> 4).\n2.  **The Trap:** The enemy is at (7, 4). If he moves LEFT, we collide. If he moves RIGHT, he hits the wall (x=9) soon. If he moves UP or DOWN, I can adjust next turn to chase him down.\n3.  **The Plan:** I will march him down. I will keep moving right until he is forced to crash into me or make a desperate move. I am not chasing apples; I am chasing HIM.\n\nI am coming for you, Snake #1!

Focus on where the enemy is.\"**\nI see an apple at **(2, 3)** (straight down). I see an apple at **(2, 5)** (straight up). I am ignoring them. Why? Because I need to hunt. I need to box Snake #1 in. He is at **(7, 4)**. I am at **(2, 4)**. We are on the same horizontal line (y=4). This is the \"Kill Zone.\" If I leave this line, I give him control of the center. I must stay on the attack vector.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP (2, 5):** Safe, but moves me away from the enemy on the Y-axis. Gives up the center line. \u274c\n- **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe (it's an apple), but moves me away from the enemy on the Y-axis. \u274c\n- **LEFT (1, 4):** My own body. DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (3, 4):** Open space. On the direct path to the enemy. \u2705\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI am moving **RIGHT** to **(3, 4)**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Dominance:** I am claiming the space between us. By moving right, I decrease the distance to the enemy (Manhattan distance 5 -> 4).\n2.  **The Trap:** The enemy is at (7, 4). If he moves LEFT, we collide. If he moves RIGHT, he hits the wall (x=9) soon. If he moves UP or DOWN, I can adjust next turn to chase him down.\n3.  **The Plan:** I will march him down. I will keep moving right until he is forced to crash into me or make a desperate move. I am not chasing apples; I am chasing HIM.\n\nI am coming for you, Snake #1!

They can go UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), or RIGHT (4,4).

Actually looking at the board... yes, he's at (7, 6). He is NOT on my horizontal line anymore. He moved UP to (7, 6). That changes things! He's trying to escape the kill zone.\n- **Score:** 1 vs 2. I am behind.\n\n**THE ENEMY'S MISTAKE:**\nHe moved UP to (7, 6). Why is this a mistake? Because I am at (4, 4). The Manhattan distance between us is now |4-7| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5. If he had stayed on the horizontal line, I would have kept pressuring him. Now he's moved into the upper quadrant. I must cut him off. He is vulnerable.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP (4, 5):** Safe? The board shows (4, 5) is empty. Yes.\n- **DOWN (4, 3):** Safe? (4, 3) is empty. Yes.\n- **LEFT (3, 4):** My own body. DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (5, 4):** Safe? (5, 4) is empty. Yes.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI need to close the distance. If I move **UP** to (4, 5), I move closer to his current position (7, 6) and potentially cut off his path if he tries to move further up or right. I also align myself to chase apples if he ignores them, but I'm ignoring the apples. I am hunting HIM.\n\nWhy **UP**?\n1.  **Aggression:** I am closing the vertical distance. If I move right, I stay on y=4 and he is on y=6. I lose the vertical chase.\n2.  **Blocking:** By moving UP, I threaten the space above him. He is at (7, 6). If I get to (4, 6) or (5, 6), I can box him in against the top wall.\n3.  **Score Deficit:** I am losing 1-2. I need to force a collision where I win. I need to pressure him until he panics.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRush him down. He's at (7, 6). I'm at (4, 4). I will move UP and RIGHT to cut the diagonal. I want to trap him in the top right corner. Do not let him breathe. Do not eat apples unless they are on the path to his head. Hunt mode: ON. \ud83e\ude78\n\nUP",

No, wait. Last turn (Turn 5), the opponent head was at (7, 7)? Let me check the replay.\n\n**LAST TURN REPLAY:**\nEnemy Head was at (7, 7). The board showed '1' at (7, 7).\nWait, looking at the \"OPPONENTS\" section for Turn 6: \"Snake #1 - Head: (7, 7)\". And the board shows '1' at (7, 7).\nBut wait, I moved UP to (4, 5) in Turn 5.\nMy head is now (4, 5).\nEnemy head is (7, 7).\nDistance: |4-7| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5.\nHe didn't move? Or he moved from (7, 6) to (7, 7) as I calculated? No, in the replay I wrote \"Enemy Head: (7, 6) - Wait, he moved UP from (7, 6) to (7, 6)? Actually looking at the board... yes, he's at (7, 6).\"\nActually, the replay for Turn 5 said: \"Enemy Head: (7, 6)\".\nBut the current Turn 6 says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (7, 7)\".\nSo he moved UP to (7, 7).\nOkay, so he moved UP from (7, 6) to (7, 7).\nI am at (4, 5).\nHe is at (7, 7).\nHe is still in the top right.\nScore: Me 1, Him 3.\nI need to close the distance.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Turn 6):**\nMy Head: (4, 5)\nMy Body: [(4, 4)]\nEnemy Head: (7, 7)\nEnemy Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   **UP (4, 6):** Empty on board. Safe? Yes.\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** My own body (tail is (4, 4)). If I move DOWN, I hit my tail. The tail moves away, but since I have length 2, moving into (4, 4) is moving backwards into my body. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am losing 1-3. I must be aggressive.\nThe enemy is at (7, 7). He is hugging the top-right corner.\nIf I move **UP** to (4, 6), I get closer to him vertically.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (5, 5), I get closer horizontally.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (3, 5), I retreat. Bad idea.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I die.\n\nWhich direction cuts him off?\nHe is at x=7, y=7.\nI am at x=4, y=5.\nIf I go UP, I am (4, 6). Distance 4.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am (5, 5). Distance 4.\nIf I go UP, I am on the same row as his body (7, 6) and (7, 5) are at y=6 and y=5.\nWait, his body is vertical at x=7. y=4, 5, 6, 7 (head).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 5), I am horizontally aligned with his body segment at (7, 5).\nIf I move UP to (4, 6), I am vertically aligned with his body segment at (7, 6).\n\nWhere is the apple? There is an apple at (4, 8). That's straight UP from me.\nIf I go UP, I might eat the apple at (4, 8) in two turns (if it's still there).\nBut I need to hunt the snake.\nThe snake is at (7, 7). The top wall is at y=9. He is trapped at the top.\nI need to push him against the wall.\nTo do that, I need to go UP to cut off his upward escape.\nIf I go RIGHT, I chase him horizontally but he can still go UP to (7, 8).\nIf I go UP, I control the y-axis.\nAlso, looking at the board, there is an apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go UP, I am on the path to the apple and cutting off the enemy.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on the path to the enemy but not cutting off his upward escape.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `. . . . A . . . . .` (Apple at 4,8)\nRow 7: `. . . . . A . 1 . .` (Enemy at 7,7)\nRow 6: `. A . . . . . T . .` (Apple at 1,6, Enemy body at 7,6)\nRow 5: `. . . . 0 . A T A .` (Me at 4,5, Apple at 6,5, Enemy body at 7,5)\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 6):\nI am safe.\nI am closer to the apple at (4, 8).\nI am closer to the enemy vertically.\nI am positioning to block his move to (7, 8) or (6, 8) etc. by taking the central vertical axis.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5):\nI am safe.\nI am moving towards the enemy horizontally.\nThere is an apple at (6, 5). I could eat it next turn.\nBut eating apples is secondary to killing the enemy.\nHowever, eating the apple at (6, 5) would put me at (6, 5), which is right next to the enemy body at (7, 5). That's dangerous if the enemy moves left.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), I threaten the space.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's moves.\nHe is at (7, 7). He can go UP (7, 8), LEFT (6, 7), or DOWN (7, 6 - INTO HIS OWN BODY). He cannot go DOWN because his body is at (7, 6).\nSo he will likely go UP or LEFT.\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), he is safe.\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 7), he is safe.\nIf I go UP to (4, 6):\nI am at (4, 6). He is at (7, 7).\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), I am at (4, 6). I can chase.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5):\nI am at (5, 5). He is at (7, 7).\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), I am at (5, 5). I am not blocking his vertical escape well.\n\nThe goal is to box him in.\nThe top wall is a barrier.\nI need to form a barrier from the left/south.\nGoing UP allows me to eventually line up with his head at y=7 or y=8.\nMy y=5 -> y=6. His y=7.\nNext turn I can go to y=7. He might go to y=8.\nThis is a vertical chase.\nAlternatively, I can go RIGHT to (5, 5).\nThen next turn I can go RIGHT to (6, 5). Then I am at x=6, y=5.\nHe is at x=7, y=7.\nThis is a diagonal chase.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go UP, I head towards that apple.\nIf I eat the apple, I grow. More body segments mean more blocking power.\nIf I go RIGHT, I head towards the apple at (6, 5).\nThe apple at (6, 5) is dangerous because it's right next to the enemy body at (7, 5).\nIf I go for (6, 5), and the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), that's fine.\nBut if the enemy moves DOWN (he can't) or something weird happens.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7, 7).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), I am at x=5.\nIf I go RIGHT again to (6, 5), I am at x=6.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (6, 7), we are at (6, 5) vs (6, 7). Close but safe (vertical distance 2).\nIf the enemy goes UP to (7, 8), I am at (6, 5).\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), I am at x=4.\nIf I go UP again to (4, 7), I am at x=4, y=7.\nEnemy at (7, 7).\nDistance 3.\nIf I go UP to (4, 8) (eating apple), I am at x=4, y=8.\nEnemy at (7, 7).\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), we are at y=8.\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 7), he is safe.\n\nThe safest path to hunt and grow is **UP**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Apple at (4, 8):** It's on the path UP. Eating it grows my body. A longer body is a better wall.\n2.  **Blocking Vertical:** By moving UP, I control the vertical center (x=4). The enemy is at x=7. To escape to the left, he has to cross x=6, x=5. By moving UP, I position myself to intercept him if he tries to slide down the left side or if he gets forced left.\n3.  **Safety:** (4, 6) is empty. (4, 7) is empty (board shows '.' at 4,7). (4, 8) has an apple. This is a clear shot.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), there is an apple at (6, 5). If I eat it, my tail moves to (4, 5). My body becomes [(5, 5), (4, 5)].\nWait, if I eat the apple at (6, 5), my head moves to (6, 5). I grow. My body becomes [(5, 5), (4, 4)]? No, wait.\nCurrent body: Head (4, 5), Body [(4, 4)].\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 5):\nHead is (5, 5).\nTail (4, 4) moves to (4, 5)?\nNo, the tail moves to where the head *was* if I don't eat an apple.\nIf I eat an apple at (5, 5)? There is no apple at (5, 5). The apple is at (6, 5).\nSo if I move RIGHT to (5, 5), I don't eat. My body becomes [(4, 5), (4, 4)].\nNext turn, if I move RIGHT to (6, 5) and eat the apple:\nHead (6, 5). I grow.\nMy body becomes [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)].\nThis is good growth.\nHowever, (6, 5) is adjacent to (7, 5) (Enemy Body).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (7, 8), I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 7), I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves... wait, his head is at (7, 7).\nHis possible moves: UP (7, 8), LEFT (6, 7).\nHe cannot move DOWN (7, 6) is his body.\nHe cannot move RIGHT (8, 7) is board edge? No, 9x9 is 0-8? Or 0-9?\n\"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\nWait, board size 10x10. Indices 0-9.\nSo (9, 9) is top right.\n(7, 7) is safe.\nEnemy moves:\nUP: (7, 8) - Empty (Row 8 shows Apple at 4,8, dots elsewhere).\nLEFT: (6, 7) - Empty (Row 7 shows Apple at 6,7? No, Row 7 is `. . . . . A . 1 . .`. Apple at (5, 7). (6, 7) is empty).\nDOWN: (7, 6) - Own Body.\nRIGHT: (8, 7) - Empty.\n\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves. He will likely move UP or LEFT to get away from me.\nIf I go UP (4, 6):\nI threaten the space above.\nIf I go RIGHT (5, 5):\nI threaten the space to the right.\n\nLet's look at the \"Box him in\" strategy.\nI need to limit his space.\nHe is in the top right corner.\nBy going UP, I take the center-left high ground.\nBy going RIGHT, I take the center-low ground.\nHe is high (y=7).\nGoing UP matches his height faster.\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), next turn I can go to (4, 7).\nHe is at (7, 7).\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), I am at (4, 7).\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 7), I am at (4, 7).\nI am getting closer vertically.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), next turn I can go to (5, 6) or (6, 5).\nIf I go to (5, 6), I am at y=6. He is at y=7.\nIf I go to (6, 5), I am at y=5.\nGoing UP seems more direct to cut off his vertical movement.\nAlso, the apple at (4, 8) is a great lure.\nIf I eat it, I grow. My tail extends.\nIf I go UP now to (4, 6), next turn I can go to (4, 7), then (4, 8).\nI will be at (4, 8). He is at (7, 7).\nIf he goes UP to (7, 8), we are at (4, 8) and (7, 8).\nIf he goes LEFT to (6, 7), I am at (4, 8).\nFrom (4, 8), I can move RIGHT to (5, 8) to pressure him further.\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK for UP (4, 6):**\n- On board: '.' (Empty)\n- Not my body\n- Not enemy body (Enemy is at 7,7 and body at 7,6, 7,5, 7,4).\n- Not off board.\n**SAFE.**\n\n**SAFETY CHECK for RIGHT (5, 5):**\n- On board: '.' (Empty)\n- Not my body\n- Not enemy body\n- Not off board.\n**SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will choose **UP**.\nReasoning:\n1.  **Aggression:** I move towards the enemy's vertical axis. He is at y=7, I am at y=5. I need to close the vertical gap to trap him against the top wall (y=9).\n2.  **Apple:** There is an apple at (4, 8). Moving UP puts me on a straight line to consume it in 2 turns. This grows my body, which helps in blocking.\n3.  **Control:** By moving UP, I occupy the space that the enemy might want to use to escape upwards. The enemy is at (7, 7). If he tries to go to the center of the board, he has to cross my x-coordinate eventually.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRush UP to (4, 6). Next turn, move UP to (4, 7) to align horizontally with the enemy head. If the apple at (4, 8) is still there, eat it on the following turn to grow. Use the increased body length to form a wall on the x=4 line, forcing the enemy into the corner (x=7-9, y=7-9). Once he is cornered, look for the head-on collision or force him into a wall.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 7 and the pressure is ON! We're still trailing 1-3, so we need to make a move that sets up the trap.\n\nLet's look at the board state. My head is at (4, 6). The enemy is at (6, 7) (I see the board shows '1' at (6, 7) now, moving from (7, 7) LEFT. Good, he's coming closer). His body trails down the x=6 column.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   **UP (4, 7):** Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe. (Apple is at 4,8, so not immediately blocking).\n*   **DOWN (4, 5):** This is my current body position (since I moved UP last turn). Hitting myself = DEAD. \ud83d\udeab\n*   **LEFT (3, 6):** Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 6):** Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe. (Apple at 5,7 is diagonally close).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is pushing LEFT towards the center (x=6). I am at x=4. I need to close the gap to cut him off.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (5, 6)**:\n*   I move horizontally towards him. Distance to his head (6, 7) becomes sqrt(2). Very aggressive.\n*   I am stepping into the \"kill zone\".\n*   If he continues LEFT to (5, 7), we would be at (5, 6) vs (5, 7) (vertical neighbors). Safe distance (1 cell gap).\n*   If he goes UP to (6, 8), I am at (5, 6).\n*   This move pressures him.\n\nIf I go **UP to (4, 7)**:\n*   I move vertically. Distance to (6, 7) is 2.\n*   I am on the same y-level as him.\n*   This positions me to block his potential UP move to (6, 8) if I can get to x=6 next turn.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (3, 6)**:\n*   I retreat. He is moving LEFT (towards me). Retreating gives him more board space. Bad for an aggressive hunter.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to be aggressive. He is at (6, 7). I am at (4, 6).\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 6) closes the distance rapidly. It forces him to react. If he goes LEFT to (5, 7), I am at (5, 6) and he is at (5, 7). We are neighbors. If he tries to turn into me next turn, he dies. If I try to turn into him, I die. It becomes a game of chicken.\nHowever, looking at the board, there is an apple at (5, 7). If I go RIGHT to (5, 6), the apple at (5, 7) is right next to me. If he doesn't eat it, I can eat it next turn.\nAlso, moving RIGHT sets me up to possibly head-on collision if he moves LEFT to (5, 7) and I move RIGHT to (5, 6)? No, simultaneous. If I am at (5, 6) and he moves to (5, 6), we crash heads. That's a double kill. I don't want that unless I'm winning (I'm not, I'm 1-3). So I need to be careful.\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (5, 6) and he moves LEFT to (5, 7), we are adjacent.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 6) and he moves UP to (6, 8), I am safe.\nIf I move UP to (4, 7) and he moves LEFT to (5, 7), we are diagonal. Safe.\nThe apple at (5, 7) is a distraction, but also a lure.\nLet's look at the apple at (4, 8). If I go UP to (4, 7), I am one step away from that apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am stepping away from that apple.\nHowever, the enemy is the priority. By moving RIGHT, I am cutting off his path to the left side of the board. He is currently at x=6. If I take x=5, I force him to stay at x>=6.\nThis is a walling strategy.\nSo, **RIGHT** is the aggressive play to build a wall.\n\nWait, let's double check the board state provided:\n`9 . . . . . A . . . .`\n`8 . . . . A . . . . .`\n`7 . . . . . . 1 . . .` (Enemy at 6,7)\n`6 . A . . . . . . . .` (Me at 4,6)\n`5 . . . . T . A T A .` (Body at 4,5)\n`4 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`3 . .

Apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (5, 6):\nI am next to the apple at (5, 7).\nI am next to the enemy body at (6, 6)? No, enemy body is at (6, 7) head, (7, 7) body, etc.\nWait, the opponent list says:\nSnake #1 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)].\nSo his body is at x=7. His head is at x=6.\nIf I go to (5, 6), I am not touching his body.\nI am 1 step away from his head (diagonally (6,7) or straight (5,7) if he moves there).\n\nIf I go **UP** to (4, 7):\nI am next to the apple at (4, 8).\nI am moving away from his head (distance 3).\nI am not aggressively walling him in.\n\nThe goal is to box him in.\nHe is moving LEFT (x decreasing).\nI am at x=4. He is at x=6.\nIf I move RIGHT to x=5, I reduce the space between us.\nIf I move UP to y=7, I am on the same row as his head.\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially block his path to the left side (x < 5).\nLet's look at his possible moves from (6, 7):\n1. LEFT to (5, 7) - There is an apple there. He might eat it.\n2. UP to (6, 8) - Empty.\n3. RIGHT to (7, 7) - Into his own body? Body is at (7, 7). Yes, he has a body segment there. So RIGHT is likely death for him (unless his tail moves, but it's a loop).\n4. DOWN to (6, 6) - Empty.\n\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 7):\nI go RIGHT to (5, 6).\nWe are at (5, 6) and (5, 7). Safe.\nIf he continues LEFT next turn to (4, 7), I could be at (5, 6) or (4, 6) or (6, 6).\nActually, if I am at (5, 6) and he is at (5, 7), I can move UP to (5, 7)? No, he is there. I can move LEFT to (4, 6).\nWait, if I am at (5, 6) and he is at (5, 7), I can move UP to (5, 7)? No, that's his head. Crash.\nI must move LEFT (4, 6), DOWN (5, 5), or RIGHT (6, 6).\nDOWN (5, 5) is empty.\nLEFT (4, 6) is empty (my tail moved to 4,5? No, I moved from 4,6 to 5,6. Tail moves to 4,6? No, tail was at 4,5. It moves to 4,6? No, body was [(4, 5)].\nHead (4, 6) -> (5, 6).\nTail (4, 5) -> (4, 6).\nSo if I go RIGHT, my body occupies (4, 6).\nSo if I am at (5, 6), (4, 6) is my body.\nIf he is at (5, 7).\nIf he goes LEFT to (4, 7), he is safe (my body is at 4,6).\nIf he goes DOWN to (5, 6), he crashes into me. He dies. I win.\nSo I want him to move DOWN into me.\nCan I force that?\nI am at (5, 6). He is at (5, 7).\nIf I move... wait, I move simultaneously.\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6), and he moves DOWN to (5, 6), we miss.\nIf I stay at (5, 6) and he moves DOWN to (5, 6), we crash heads? No, he moves into my body (which is now at 5,6? No, my head moves. My body moves).\nSimultaneous movement is tricky.\nBut generally, forcing him into tight corners is good.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nApple at (4, 8) is a great growth point.\nApple at (5, 7) is right next to him.\nIf I go RIGHT, I threaten the space around him.\nIf I go UP, I secure growth.\nGiven the score is 1-3, I need to be aggressive but safe.\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 6) puts me in a position to control the central area.\nThe apple at (4, 8) is tempting. If I go UP, I get closer to it.\nIf I go UP to (4, 7):\nI am at (4, 7).\nHe is at (6, 7).\nDistance 2.\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 7), distance is 1.\nIf he goes UP to (6, 8), distance is sqrt(3).\nIf he goes DOWN to (6, 6), distance is sqrt(3).\nIf I go UP, I am effectively moving towards the wall.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards the enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Aggression:** I am closing the distance to the enemy head.\n2.  **Walling:** I am occupying the x=5 line. The enemy is at x=6. If he wants to go left (x<5), he has to get past me.\n3.  **Apple Option:** By moving to (5, 6), I am adjacent to the apple at (5, 7). If he doesn't take it, I can take it next turn.\n4.  **Safety:** (5, 6) is empty. My tail moves to (4, 6), securing that spot.\n\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from the immediate threat area. I want to engage.\nIf I go RIGHT, I engage.\n\nLet's simulate the worst case.\nI go RIGHT to (5, 6).\nEnemy goes LEFT to (5, 7).\nI am at (5, 6). Body at (4, 6).\nHe is at (5, 7).\nNext turn, I can move UP to (5, 7)? No, he is there.\nI can move LEFT to (4, 6)? No, my body is there.\nI can move RIGHT to (6, 6)? Yes.\nI can move DOWN to (5, 5)? Yes.\nSo I have options.\nHe is at (5, 7). He can move UP (5, 8), LEFT (4, 7), DOWN (5, 6 - into my body), RIGHT (6, 7 - into his body).\nIf he moves DOWN to (5, 6), he dies.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6, 7), he dies (his body is there).\nSo he must move UP or LEFT.\nIf he moves UP to (5, 8), I am at (5, 6). I can move UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6).\nThis seems like a good trap setup. I am forcing his moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 7):\nHe goes LEFT to (5, 7).\nI am at (4, 7). He is at (5, 7).\nI can move RIGHT to (5, 7)? Crash.\nI can move UP to (4, 8)? Eat apple.\nI can move LEFT to (3, 7)?\nThis is also good, but I am further from his body.\nI prefer the proximity of RIGHT.\n\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 7: `. . . . . . 1 . . .` (Apple at 5,7 is empty on board representation? No, row 7 is `. . . . . . 1 . . .`\nWait, let me re-read the board state carefully.\n`7 . . . . . . 1 . . .`\nThe dots are empty.\nApple at (5, 7) is listed in \"APPLE DROPS\".\nThe board state visual is just positions of snakes/apples.\nSo (5, 7) is empty (visually) but contains an apple.\n(6, 7) is Enemy Head '1'.\n(4, 7) is empty.\n\nSo if I go RIGHT to (5, 6):\nI am at (5, 6).\nIf he goes LEFT to (5, 7), he eats the apple. He grows.\nIf he eats the apple, his tail doesn't move immediately? No, if he eats, he grows. His body length increases.\nIf he is at (5, 7), and I am at (5, 6).\nIf I move UP to (5, 7), I crash into him.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 6), I am safe.\nIf he moves DOWN to (5, 6), he crashes into me.\nSo it's a standoff.\nBut if he eats the apple, he gets closer to 30. I need to stop him.\nBy moving RIGHT, I am blocking his path to the left side.\nThe apple at (5, 7) is a bait.\nIf I go UP to (4, 7), I am not blocking him from the apple. He will likely take it.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 6), I am threatening the space. He might hesitate to take the apple because he might crash into me next turn if he stays there or moves down.\nActually, if I go RIGHT to (5, 6), and he goes LEFT to (5, 7), I cannot kill him next turn unless he moves into me.\nBut I can trap him.\nLet's look at the apple at (4, 8).\nIf I go UP to (4, 7), I can eat (4, 8) next turn.\nEating grows me. 1->2 apples. Score 2-3.\nThis is good.\nBut I'm letting him eat (5, 7) if he wants.\nIf I go RIGHT, I deny him the space to my left.\nLet's compare:\nOption A (UP): I get closer to my apple (4,8). I let him have (5,7). Score 2-3 (if I eat next turn). Distance to enemy increases.\nOption B (RIGHT): I block his path. I threaten (5,7). I stay close to enemy. Score remains 1-3 (for now).\n\nI am losing 1-3. I need to engage.\nIf I let him eat apples uncontested, I lose.\nSo I must pressure him.\n**RIGHT** is the pressure move.\n\nOne more check: What if he moves UP to (6, 8)?\nI go RIGHT to (5, 6).\nHe goes UP to (6, 8).\nDistance is large.\nBut I have secured the center (x=5).\nIf he moves UP, I can chase him next turn (e.g., to (5, 7) or (6, 6)).\nIf he moves LEFT to (5, 7), I am at (5, 6).\nThis creates a wall.\n\nFinal decision: **RIGHT**. Cut off his escape. Force him to deal with me.\n\nUP is safe but passive.\nDOWN is death.\nLEFT is retreat.\nRIGHT is the only aggressive option.\n\nWait, is (5, 6) empty?\nBoard state row 6: `. A . . . . . . . .`\nRow 6 is y=6.\n(0,6) empty\n(1,6) Apple\n(2,6) empty\n(3,6) empty\n(4,6) Me (Head)\n(5,6) empty\n(6,6) empty\n(7,6) empty (Body at 7,5, 7,6? No, Body list is [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. Wait, if Head is (6,7), body is (7,7), (7,6), (7,5).\nSo (7,6) is body. (6,6) is empty.\n(5,6) is empty.\n(4,6) is me.\nSo (5,6) is safe.\n\nLet's go!\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body at [(4, 6)]. Apples: 1.\n**Enemy State:** Head at (5, 7). Body at [(6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. Apples: 4.\n\nWait, hold up. Look at the ASCII board again.\nRow 7 (y=7): `. . . . . . 1 . . .` -> Enemy Head is at (6, 7).\nRow 6 (y=6): `. A . . . 0 . . . .` -> My Head is at (5, 6).\n\nBUT the text description says:\nOpponent: Head (5, 7), Body [(6, 7)...].\n**CONFLICT!** The text says (5, 7), the ASCII says (6, 7).\nIf the text is correct, we are literally HEAD TO HEAD. (Me at 5,6, Him at 5,7).\nIf the ASCII is correct, we are diagonal.\n\n**Strategy Logic:**\nGiven the score is 1-4, I need to be aggressive but NOT suicidal.\nIf we are stacked vertically (Text version):\n- If I go UP to (5, 7), we collide heads. I lose (I have fewer apples).\n- If I go LEFT to (4, 6), I hit my own body (my tail is at 4,6? Wait, my body is [(4,6)]. My head moves to 4,6. That is my body. I DIE).\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 6), I am safe. But I step sideways.\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 5), I am safe.\n\nIf we are diagonal (ASCII version - Me 5,6 Him 6,7):\n- All moves are safe regarding collision, but I need to set up the kill.\n\n**Assuming the ASCII map is the ground truth (6,7) for enemy head:**\nEnemy is at (6, 7). I am at (5, 6).\nI am below and left of him.\nApple at (5, 7) is RIGHT above me.\nApple at (4, 8) is UP-LEFT.\n\n**The Trap:**\nI want to box him in.\nHe is in the top-right quadrant of my view.\nIf I move **UP** to (5, 7):\n- I eat the apple! \ud83c\udf4e (+1 Score, 1 -> 2 apples).\n- I occupy the spot directly between him and the left side.\n- If he continues to chase apples or move, I have cut off his retreat to the left.\n\n**Safety Check for UP (to 5, 7):**\n- Is it out of bounds? No.\n- Is it my body? No, my body is at (4, 6).\n- Is it enemy body? No, enemy body is at (6, 7) head, (7, 7) body, etc.\n- Is it enemy head? No (Assuming ASCII truth).\n- **Risk:** If the text description is correct and he is at (5, 7), moving UP is suicide. However, usually the visual ASCII map is the \"source of truth\" for board state in these games. The text might be describing the *previous* position or a misinterpretation.\n- **BUT** looking at the ASCII map row 7: `7 . . . . . . 1 . . .` -> There is a '1' at x=6. There is NO '1' at x=5.\n- Therefore, the ASCII map is accurate. The enemy is at (6, 7).\n\n**Why UP is the winning move:**\n1.  **Growth:** I grab the apple at (5, 7). I need to close the score gap (1-4).\n2.  **Positioning:** Moving to (5, 7) places me directly in the path between the enemy (6, 7) and the open board to the left (x < 5). I am effectively walling him in against the right edge.\n3.  **Options:** From (5, 7), I can easily move to (5, 8), (4, 7), or (6, 7) (if he moves away).\n4.  **Threat:** By moving UP, I am aggressively stepping into his personal space. If he moves DOWN to (6, 6), he is safe. If he moves LEFT to (5, 7), we collide heads (I win if I have more apples, or we tie if I eat this turn and get 2 vs 4? No, simultaneous. He dies, I live). Actually, if he moves into me, he dies.\n\n**Comparison to other moves:**\n- **LEFT (4, 6):** Into my own body. DEAD. \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT (6, 6):** Safe, but moves me AWAY from the apple at (5, 7) and AWAY from the enemy. Passive.\n- **DOWN (5, 5):** Safe, but moves me away from the enemy and the apple. Passive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI must be aggressive. The ASCII map confirms he is at (6, 7). I am at (5, 6).\nMoving **UP** to (5, 7) secures food and positions me to dominate the center. I am forcing him to react to MY position.\n\n**Plan:** Grab the apple, cut off his left flank, and prepare to box him in against the right wall. If he tries to cross into my space, he dies.\n\nLET'S GOOO!\n\nUP",

Neck: (6,7) \u2192 RIGHT is directly backwards (instant death). \u274c\n- Opponent head: (5,6), neck: (4,6) \u2192 they cannot move LEFT.

NOPE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7): empty, safe now, moves us toward the foe\u2019s side and enables a squeeze. \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (5,8): safe, keeps distance and options, but drifts off the immediate boxing lane. \u2705 but less aggressive.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6): currently occupied by their head \u2014 risky.
