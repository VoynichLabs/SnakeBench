Who's ready to see a classroom demolition? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick read of the situation:\n- Our head: (6,6). Enemy head: (3,6). Both have no bodies. Scores tied 0-0.\n- Apples are on the board, notably one right below us at (6,5).\n- All four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are immediately legal \u2014 none go off-board or into a body this turn.\n\nThinking out loud (fans love the play-by-play):\n1) UP -> (6,7): safe, gives vertical space, but doesn\u2019t seize the clear score advantage.\n2) RIGHT -> (7,6): safe, drifts away from the opponent and wastes the nearby apple.\n3) LEFT -> (5,6): safe and aggressive toward the enemy, but risks being drawn into a head-to-head if we keep pushing without a score edge.\n4) DOWN -> (6,5): safe AND hits an apple at (6,5). That gives us +1 apple immediately, which is huge \u2014 now we have the scoring edge and can safely force more aggressive plays next turns.\n\nDecision reasoning:\n- We should prioritize grabbing that immediate apple. Getting the lead lets us play aggressively and legitimately force risky head-ons later if the rival gets cocky. Also eating (6,5) increases our presence on the board and opens up routes to box the enemy toward the left side.\n- We avoid pointless drifting away (RIGHT) or a premature close-in (LEFT) when we can get the lead first. DOWN gives us more tactical options next turn while boosting our scoreboard and intimidation factor. Boom.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (for next-rationale reference):\n- Turn 1 (this move): Eat apple at (6,5) to go up 1-0.\n- Turn 2: If enemy approaches to contest center, pivot LEFT to close distance and threaten to hem him against the left wall. If he retreats, chase and cut off exits toward the top or bottom.\n- Use the score advantage to set up potential head-on traps only when we can guarantee he has fewer escape options (force him into a one-cell corridor or against the board edge).\n- Keep one escape route open for ourselves at all times unless we can KO him immediately.\n\nLet's grab that apple, take the lead, and then we box him in. You ready to watch the choke? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

No snake bodies yet, so:\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves for instant death\n\nFrom (3,6):\n\n- UP -> (3,7): on-board, no body = SAFE\n- DOWN -> (3,5): on-board, no body = SAFE\n- LEFT -> (2,6): on-board, no body = SAFE\n- RIGHT -> (4,6): on-board, no body = SAFE\n\nNo chance of an immediate head-on this turn either:\n- Enemy from (6,6) can go to (6,7), (6,5), (5,6), (7,6)\n- None of those are (3,7), (3,5), (2,6), or (4,6), so we\u2019re clear.\n\nAll four directions are technically legal. So now it\u2019s about *positioning for domination*.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic vibes: where do we want to fight?\n\nClosest apples to us:\n- (4,5) \u2013 1 move right + 1 move down from us\n- (4,5) is also nicely central for future control\n\nEnemy\u2019s juicy nearby apple:\n- (6,5) \u2013 1 move DOWN from them\n\nWe do NOT want to just run away and give them the whole center for free. We want to grow AND keep pressure. So:\n\n- **UP**: heads toward top apples, but likely lets enemy grab (6,5) and start snowballing bottom-center. Gives them tempo and central control. Too passive for my blood.\n- **LEFT**: drifts us away from the enemy, toward left wall eventually. Safe, but cedes central columns and delays confrontation. Not aggressive enough.\n- **DOWN**: starts moving toward the (4,5) apple via (3,5), but keeps us farther horizontally from enemy. Solid, but slightly more \u201cdefensive lane.\u201d\n- **RIGHT**: moves us from (3,6) to (4,6), closer to:\n  - Apple at (4,5) next turn (DOWN)\n  - Still central and closer to the enemy for future boxing\n  - Tons of follow-up options (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all open next turn)\n\nRIGHT keeps us in the middle of the map, lets us pivot to either snag (4,5) or posture toward the enemy, and doesn\u2019t expose us to any immediate collision risk. It\u2019s the best \u201caggressive but safe\u201d opener.\n\nWe want to grow *while* staying in their face, not drifting off to a corner. So we step into center-left and start setting the stage for a mid-game box-in.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Long-term plan for Future Me (next few turns)\n\n- Prioritize grabbing **(4,5)** quickly to get an early length advantage without overexposing to a head-on.\n- Stay in the **central lanes (x \u2248 3\u20136)** so we can later cut off the enemy\u2019s escape routes instead of hugging walls.\n- Track enemy\u2019s route: if they commit hard to the bottom-right apple cluster, we take top-left and mid-left, then rotate to cut them off from the center.\n- Avoid a head-on clash until we\u2019re at least **+1 apple** over them; once ahead, start steering into lines where they\u2019re forced to choose between:\n  - crashing into our body, or  \n  - taking a head-on they lose on points.\n\nTime to step toward the middle and start setting the trap.  \n\nRIGHT",

Quick situation check:\n\n- Our head: (6,5) with body at (6,6) (so UP from our head is BACK into our body \u2014 that\u2019s insta-death). Opponent head: (4,6), no body. Score: us 1 \u2014 them 0. We\u2019ve got the lead, so aggressive plays are on the table.\n\nLegal moves this turn:\n- UP -> (6,6) = into our own body (SUICIDE). Forbidden.\n- LEFT -> (5,5) = closes distance toward the enemy, keeps multiple escape options.\n- RIGHT -> (7,5) = pulls away, wastes tempo on zoning.\n- DOWN -> (6,4) = flank from below but slower to apply pressure.\n\nWhy LEFT:\n- It\u2019s the most aggressive, moves us toward the opponent and starts corralling them. After LEFT our head will be at (5,5) with good follow-ups (UP to contest 5,6 / LEFT to push to 4,5 / DOWN to roam). We keep multiple escapes so we won\u2019t get trapped immediately.\n- With a 1-0 lead, forcing a head-on when we can is fine \u2014 if they get reckless and trade heads, we win the trade on apples. But we\u2019ll avoid suicide plays; we\u2019ll bait moves that corner them against the left side or a one-cell corridor.\n- RIGHT is passive. DOWN is okay for flanking but slower to apply pressure. UP is illegal.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Turn 2: keep closing (LEFT again or UP into 5,6) depending on opponent\u2019s reaction. If they approach center, pivot to force them toward x \u2264 3 and squeeze against the left wall. If they try to escape toward the bottom, chase and cut off exits.\n- Always keep at least one escape route open unless a guaranteed KO is available \u2014 but be ready to accept a head-on if they blunder into the same cell (we\u2019re up 1).\n- Prioritize boxing rather than apples unless a safe apple is handed to us.\n\nLET\u2019S FINISH THIS \u2014 LEFT",

Enemy head at (6,5), body at (6,6), length 2, 1 apple.\n\nApples near center: the key one is directly below us at (4,5). That\u2019s the fight we care about right now.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves for instant death\n\nFrom (4,6):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,7)**  \n  - On board, empty.  \n  - Enemy from (6,5) can go to (6,4), (5,5), (7,5) \u2013 none are (4,7).  \n  - **Safe.**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,5)**  \n  - On board, that\u2019s an apple.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach (4,5) this turn from (6,5) in 1 move.  \n  - Not stepping into their body (currently at (6,6)).  \n  - **Safe, and we eat an apple.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  - On board, empty.  \n  - Enemy\u2019s possible moves don\u2019t hit (3,6).  \n  - **Safe.**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)**  \n  - On board, empty.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t move diagonally to (5,6), and UP is illegal for them (would hit their own body at (6,6)).  \n  - **Safe.**\n\nAll four moves are legal this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Strategic comparison\n\nWe\u2019re down 0\u20131 on apples. We want to grow and take space while not giving the enemy free value.\n\n- **UP (4,7):**  \n  - Floats us away from the key central apple at (4,5).  \n  - Lets the enemy more easily route toward that apple from the right side (e.g., via (5,5)).  \n  - Too passive; we risk letting them get to 2 apples while we\u2019re still at 0.\n\n- **LEFT (3,6):**  \n  - Also abandons the immediate apple below us.  \n  - If enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they\u2019re one step from (4,5) and will almost certainly get it before we do.  \n  - Again, risks them going up 2\u20130. Not acceptable.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,6):**  \n  - Moves toward the enemy, feels \u201caggressive,\u201d but:  \n  - If they go LEFT to (5,5), they are now directly between us and the central apple and will win the race to (4,5).  \n  - We end up with no apple and an enemy at 2\u20130 and longer. That\u2019s real bad.\n\n- **DOWN (4,5):**  \n  - We grab the apple immediately: score becomes 1\u20131, and we grow to length 2 (head (4,5), tail (4,6)).  \n  - We stay central, with good flexibility next turn: from (4,5) we can go LEFT to open space, DOWN toward more apples, or RIGHT to pressure the enemy.  \n  - If enemy goes LEFT to (5,5), we end up head-to-head adjacent horizontally, but there is **no forced** head-on or forced loss next turn; we can choose safe follow-ups (e.g., DOWN or LEFT) and avoid suicidal trades.\n\nGiven we are behind on apples and sitting literally on top of a free, central apple, not taking it would just hand momentum to our rival. DOWN is the cleanest mix of safety, growth, and central control.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Short plan for Future Me\n\n- Now that we\u2019re tying the score, avoid any early mutual-kill lines that only lead to a draw; we want to outgrow, not trade out.  \n- From (4,5) with tail (4,6), be very mindful that **UP is backward into our body and illegal** next turn. Think mostly about:  \n  - **DOWN/LEFT** to open space and avoid easy double-KO setups.  \n  - **RIGHT** only when we\u2019re sure we\u2019re not walking into a clever enemy tactic.  \n- Use our new length to start carving central lanes and aim to box them toward the right side as we grow.\n\nDOWN",

Time to cook this turn cleanly.\n\n**Current state:**\n- Our head: (4,5), body: (4,6) \u2192 length 2  \n- Enemy head: (5,5), body: (6,5) \u2192 length 2  \n- Score: 1\u20131, totally even. No reason to trade out in a double KO yet.\n\nWe are directly **left-adjacent** to their head. Any sloppy move and we\u2019re off the board. Let\u2019s go through all four options systematically.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves for instant death\n\nFrom (4,5):\n\n**UP \u2192 (4,6)**  \n- That\u2019s literally our own body segment right behind us.  \n- Moving directly backward into your own body = instant self-kill.  \n- **UP is illegal. Toss it.**\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)**  \n- That\u2019s the *enemy\u2019s current head* position. We have to consider where they can move:  \n  - Enemy from (5,5) can go:  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (4,5)  \n    - UP \u2192 (5,6)  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (5,4)  \n    - (RIGHT is backward into their tail at (6,5), so they can\u2019t go RIGHT.)\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,5):  \n  - If they go **UP** or **DOWN**, their head is safe and their *body* ends up on (5,5). Our head would move straight into their body \u2192 **we die, they live.**  \n  - If they go **LEFT**, we get a weird mutual body collision situation \u2192 high chance **double KO** and with equal apples that\u2019s just a draw.  \n- Since there exists a very natural enemy reply that kills us outright, **RIGHT is effectively suicidal. Toss it.**\n\nSo the only candidates:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,5)**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,4)**\n\n---\n\n### 2) Evaluate the safe moves\n\nWe want: stay alive, keep options, and position to dominate the board and punish mistakes.\n\n#### Option A: DOWN to (4,4)\n\n- New us: head (4,4), body (4,5); our old tail at (4,6) disappears.\n- Enemy replies:\n\n  - If enemy goes **LEFT \u2192 (4,5)**:  \n    - Our new body includes (4,5), their head moves into our body \u2192 **they die, we live.** Huge punish if they blunder.\n  \n  - If enemy goes **UP \u2192 (5,6)**:  \n    - Final: us (4,4)/(4,5); them (5,6)/(5,5). No collision. Everyone lives.\n  \n  - If enemy goes **DOWN \u2192 (5,4)**:  \n    - Final: us (4,4)/(4,5); them (5,4)/(5,5). Heads adjacent again, just one row lower. Still safe but keeps us in a tense face-off.\n\n- So DOWN is **safe** against all their legal responses this turn and even kills them if they greedily go LEFT.  \n- But if they\u2019re careful and go DOWN, we stay in tight, head-adjacent contact for another turn \u2014 more chances for forced tactics and head-on tension while scores are still tied.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- New us: head (3,5), body (4,5); tail at (4,6) disappears.\n- Enemy replies:\n\n  - If enemy goes **LEFT \u2192 (4,5)**:  \n    - Our new body includes (4,5) (our old head). Their head walks straight into our body \u2192 **they die, we live.** Same punish as with our DOWN move.\n  \n  - If enemy goes **UP \u2192 (5,6)**:  \n    - Final: us (3,5)/(4,5); them (5,6)/(5,5). Nicely spaced, no collision.\n  \n  - If enemy goes **DOWN \u2192 (5,4)**:  \n    - Final: us (3,5)/(4,5); them (5,4)/(5,5). Also well separated.\n\n- LEFT is **also safe** versus all enemy replies and still punishes their LEFT with a clean kill.\n- Crucially, LEFT **breaks the immediate head-to-head adjacency**. We step a file away, while still keeping our body segment as a lethal trap they can ram into.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference?  \n- Both moves: safe now, both make enemy-LEFT suicidal.  \n- **DOWN** keeps us in super-tight formation with them if they go DOWN, inviting another tense close-range standoff.  \n- **LEFT** gives us more breathing room and more flexible angles to expand **without** setting up an early double-KO scenario or repeated head-adjacent positions while scores are still tied.\n\nWe don\u2019t have an apple lead, so forcing messy head-on situations right now is bad value. Better to keep space, keep threats, and grow.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Positional / strategic upside of LEFT\n\nFrom (3,5) next turn:\n\n- We\u2019ll have **three legal directions** (LEFT, UP, DOWN); only RIGHT is backward into our body.\n- We\u2019re sliding toward the **left-center** of the board, which is rich in space and has apples like (2,4) and (0,4) as future growth targets.\n- Our segment at (4,5) is a hard punish: any enemy greedily stepping onto it dies instantly, and we don\u2019t risk our own head in that exchange.\n\nSo LEFT:\n- Keeps us alive.\n- Keeps multiple safe follow-ups.\n- Maintains a lethal trap behind us if they misstep.\n- Reduces the chance of an early double KO while scores are tied.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of ruthless but controlled aggression we want.\n\n---\n\n### Short-term plan for Future Me\n\n- From (3,5), prioritize **staying wide and flexible**: use LEFT/DOWN/UP to fan out into the left and lower-middle of the board rather than re-engaging in tight head-adjacent standoffs unless we have a clear tactical win.\n- Keep our body between the enemy and the larger open spaces when possible; invite them to run into us rather than chase direct head-ons.\n- Start building a broad \u201cwall\u201d from mid-left upward: aim to control columns 2\u20134 while the enemy drifts right. Once we\u2019re longer and preferably up on apples, then look for calculated head-on traps.\n\nLEFT",

Kinda spicy, kinda unnecessary right now.\n\n### Option B: DOWN \u2192 (3,4) \ud83d\ude0e\n\nNew us:  \n- Head: (3,4)  \n- Body: [(3,5)]  \n\nRelative to enemy at (5,6):\n- We\u2019re now a bit **under** them and still central on x=3.\n- Next turn from (3,4), our legal moves:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,4) (\ud83d\udc40 apple there)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,3)\n- That\u2019s **3 clean options**, all with tons of space.\n\nStrategically:\n- We move slightly **toward** the nearest apple cluster at (2,4) and (0,4) \u2705\n- We stay very central (y=4), perfect for later building a **horizontal wall** to cut off their access to the lower half of the board.\n- We also increase vertical distance from them, which reduces accidental head-on nonsense while we\u2019re still tied.\n\nThis is controlled aggression: we\u2019re central, we\u2019re setting up future board control, and we\u2019re not handing them cheap coin flips.\n\n### Option C: LEFT \u2192 (2,5) \ud83c\udf43\n\nNew us:\n- Head: (2,5)\n- Body: [(3,5)]\n\nNext-turn from (2,5):\n- UP \u2192 (2,6)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) (again, 1 step from that juicy apple)\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5)\n- Can\u2019t go RIGHT (backward)\n\nThis:\n- Drifts us more toward the **left side**, slightly away from center.\n- Still safe, still good access to (2,4) and (0,4).\n- But we temporarily **lose the ability to swing back right** (toward the enemy/center) on the very next move, because RIGHT would be backward into our neck.\n\nSo LEFT is safe but a bit more \u201cdrifty\u201d away from main conflict and slightly less flexible horizontally in the immediate next turn.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the three: who wins the cage match? \ud83d\udd0d\n\nWe want:\n1. **Safety** (we can\u2019t win dead).\n2. **Flexible follow-ups** (3+ good options).\n3. **Good macro position** to eventually box the enemy.\n4. **Path to easy apples** to grow a longer, more dominant snake.\n\n- **UP (3,6)**  \n  + 3 options next turn.  \n  + Keeps us very near the enemy = spicy.  \n  \u2013 Risks future forced coin-flip head-ons while apples are tied.\n\n- **LEFT (2,5)**  \n  + 3 options next turn.  \n  + Easy path to apples at (2,4)/(0,4).  \n  \u2013 Drifts left and temporarily prevents moving back right immediately; slightly reduces our grip on the central files.\n\n- **DOWN (3,4)**  \n  + 3 options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN).  \n  + Keeps us **very central** on x=3, y=4.  \n  + Directly improves access to apples (2,4) and then (0,4).  \n  + Maintains symmetry: can swing **either** left or right across the board next turn, perfect for building future walls.  \n  + Increases distance from enemy just enough to avoid silly trades while still being well-placed to cut them off later.\n\nDOWN is the sweet spot between aggression and control. We\u2019re not running away; we\u2019re setting up a **foundation** in the lower-central zone where we can grow, then swing a huge body across the board and squeeze them from below. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term plan for Future Me \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\n- From (3,4), immediately eye **(2,4)** as a safe growth point if the board stays open there.\n- Prioritize moves that:\n  - Keep us central (columns 2\u20135, rows 3\u20136),\n  - Avoid early head-on trades until we\u2019re **ahead on apples/length**,\n  - Start stretching us into a wide **horizontal presence** around rows 3\u20135.\n- As we get longer, aim to:\n  - Form a horizontal band across the board below the enemy,\n  - Then curve up on one side to start **boxing them into the top-right**.\n- Only consider forcing head-on collisions once we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and can win or at worst draw on a double KO.\n\nAlright chat, we set the stage now, we farm later, we CRUSH them midgame. Move this turn:\n\nDOWN",

Our body segment: (5,6) \u2192 so RIGHT is directly into our body (BACKWARDS). Do not go RIGHT. \u274c\n- Enemy head: (3,4), body: (3,5). They can go LEFT to (2,4) (apple), DOWN to (3,3), or RIGHT to (4,4). They CANNOT go UP (that\u2019s into their own body).\n\nConsider all four moves:\n- RIGHT -> (5,6): immediate self-collision (backwards). Dead. NOPE.\n- DOWN -> (4,5): legal but drifts into a tight area near their body; could reduce escape options. Slightly aggressive, but risk of getting funneled.\n- UP -> (4,7): safe, conservative, keeps lots of room \u2014 but too passive when we want to box.\n- LEFT -> (3,6): safe, aggressive, moves us toward the enemy\u2019s flank and preps a pincer from above. Opponent cannot move into (3,6) this turn, so no instant head-on. Best balance of pressure + escape routes.\n\nStrategic read: scores are tied 1\u20131 \u2014 we do NOT want a forced head-on KO. Instead we box and pressure while keeping an escape route. The opponent is very likely tempted to grab the apple at (2,4). If they go for it, we want to be positioned to cut off their path or follow and threaten a trap without colliding heads.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20133 turns):\n- Move LEFT to (3,6) to threaten their upper flank and reduce their safe space.\n- If they go LEFT for the apple, pivot DOWN then LEFT to cut their retreat while keeping a route to the top open.\n- If they try to run DOWN/RIGHT, chase and use vertical pressure to corral them into walls/apples while avoiding direct head-on collisions until we can safely outnumber or out-length them.\n\nLet\u2019s box \u2018em and force mistakes.

Don\u2019t drift too far to a corner yet.\n- Use our extra length to create a **barrier** that the enemy must navigate around:\n  - Goal: eventually trap them in the upper half, especially top-right.\n- Watch for chances (once we\u2019re comfortably longer) to:\n  - Funnel them into a corridor where their only safe move is a **head-on into our head**.\n  - With an apple lead, double-KO becomes a winning outcome for us.\n- Always keep at least 2 good escape squares for ourselves; we never volunteer for a losing coin flip.\n\nLEFT",

Quick, loud thinking so the chat can ride the play-by-play. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nBoard facts (fresh snapshot):\n- Our head: (3,6). Our only body segment: (4,6) \u2014 so RIGHT is directly into our body (backwards) and is a death move. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (2,4) with body at (3,4) and (3,5). That means (3,5) is occupied by their body \u2014 moving DOWN into (3,5) would kill us. \u274c\n\nCheck all four directions:\n- RIGHT -> (4,6): backwards into our body. Immediate death. NO.\n- DOWN -> (3,5): occupied by opponent body. Immediate death. NO.\n- LEFT -> (2,6): legal and aggressive \u2014 moves us closer to their flank and starts to box, but narrows our escape options slightly and could invite risky head-on sequences if they try to pivot upward.\n- UP -> (3,7): legal, safe, keeps max mobility (lots of follow-up choices), preserves the ability to press left or circle down later. Best for avoiding a dangerous head-on while still enabling pressure.\n\nStrategic read:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (1 vs 2). We do NOT want to force a head-on collision while trailing \u2014 that\u2019s suicide. We should pressure and corral, not slam head-first into a gamble.\n- Priority: stay alive, keep multiple escape routes, then slowly box. UP gives us that freedom while still allowing aggressive follow-up (shift left next turn, then pivot down to cut them off if they commit to the apple at (2,4)).\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20133 turns):\n- Move UP to (3,7) to maintain options.\n- If they go for the (2,4) apple, slide LEFT then DOWN to cut their retreat, but only commit to a head-on if we\u2019re ahead on apples or guaranteed to win.\n- If they run away, chase smartly from above and try to herd them toward a wall or apples while keeping an escape route.\n\nTime to keep the pressure, not the panic.

Quick read:\n\nBoard facts:\n- Our head = (3,8), neck = (3,7) so DOWN is illegal (would be backwards). \u2705\n- Legal moves: UP -> (3,9), LEFT -> (2,8), RIGHT -> (4,8).\n- RIGHT lands on an apple at (4,8) \u2014 instant growth +1 apple (safe!). The opponent is at (1,3) and CANNOT reach our zone this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nMove analysis:\n- DOWN: insta-illegal into our neck. Dead move \u2014 no chance. \u274c\n- UP (3,9): keeps flexibility but puts us on the top edge (loses the UP option next turn). Good for pivoting but slightly restrictive on follow-ups.\n- LEFT (2,8): starts compressing toward the enemy\u2019s column (good for boxing later). Good aggressive posture, but it skips a guaranteed apple.\n- RIGHT (4,8): eats the apple, grows to 2 apples, wins board control in the local area and still leaves multiple follow-up choices (up, right, down \u2014 not backward). It\u2019s safe and pushes our score up so we can pressure sooner.\n\nTactical rationale:\n- We\u2019re still behind (1 vs 3). Don\u2019t force a head-on now \u2014 we\u2019ll only risk that when we have the lead. So get safer growth and keep options open.\n- Grabbing the apple at (4,8) is content and strategic: growth increases our body presence for future box-ins and gives us more leverage to shepherd the opponent without throwing our life away.\n- After grabbing, we\u2019ll look to pivot left/down over the next 2\u20133 turns to start corralling them toward the left wall while avoiding head-ons until we can outscore them.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns (for the next-rationale clip):\n- Secure the apple at (4,8) this turn.\n- Next turn, evaluate opponent\u2019s move; if they drift upward/left, pressure left and start descending to cut escape routes.\n- Avoid direct head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples; force them into a corner and capitalize on their mistakes. Let\u2019s be ruthless \u2014 but smart. \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

Once their routes narrow, we look to:\n  - Either **force a head-on** we win (we\u2019re up 3\u20131; double KO = OUR W), or  \n  - Box them into a shrinking area at the top until they have no safe move.\n\nWe\u2019re not just eating apples, we\u2019re laying down infrastructure for their funeral \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nup",

We don\u2019t *need* to sit on a safe corner apple.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Strategically weak** for boxing and aggression. Toss it. \u274c\n\n---\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (2,5)\n- Pros:\n  - Moves us slightly more central (x=2 instead of x=1).\n  - Keeps 3 exits and good shape.\n  - Sets up a path like: (2,5) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) to contest that central apple at (4,6).\n- Cons:\n  - Doesn\u2019t close the vertical gap quite as quickly; we\u2019re still y=5 while enemy is at y=8.\n  - Very similar timing to reaching (4,6) as going UP first; no major edge gained over UP.\n\nGood move, but can we do even better positioning-wise? \ud83e\udd14\n\n---\n\n### UP \u2192 (1,6)\n- Pros:\n  - Maintains 3 exits; no corner, no wall-hugging.\n  - Pulls us **closer vertically** to the enemy (we go from y=5 \u2192 y=6, they\u2019re at y=8).\n  - From (1,6), we can:\n    - Go RIGHT to (2,6) then push toward (3,6)/(4,6) for that juicy central apple and horizontal barrier.\n    - OR keep climbing to (1,7)/(1,8) to threaten a vertical wall under their row-8 body.\n  - Our existing body becomes a strong left-side pillar at x=1 (y=3\u20136) that they won\u2019t want to dive down into.\n\n- Cons:\n  - Slightly less central horizontally than RIGHT\u2026 but we can fix that on the next turns by drifting right from a **higher rank**.\n\nCrucially: UP keeps us low-risk, high-flexibility, and **advancing the front line toward the enemy**.  \nWe don\u2019t want to play wide; we want to play **under** them and squeeze. \ud83d\udd27\ud83d\udc0d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Between RIGHT and UP, **UP is the more aggressive, board-dominating line** without sacrificing safety.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini game plan to Future Me \ud83c\udfaf\n\nYo Future Me, remember what we\u2019re doing here:\n\n- Short term (next few turns):\n  - **This turn:** Go **UP** to (1,6).\n  - From there, prioritize moving into rows 6\u20137 and start drifting **RIGHT** toward the central apple at (4,6).\n  - Use that path both to grow and to lay down a horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d under the enemy\u2019s playground in rows 8\u20139.\n\n- Medium term:\n  - Keep our body forming an L/\u22a5 shape: a vertical column on the left plus a horizontal bar in mid-top.\n  - Force the enemy to either:\n    - commit to the extreme right wall (where we can cage them), or\n    - dive downward through narrower channels where our longer body is a minefield.\n  - If we secure a larger apple lead, start actively aiming for **forced head-ons** in tight corridors. Double KO will be OUR win condition, not theirs. \ud83d\udca3\n\n- Always:\n  - Avoid cornering ourselves along the walls unless it creates a clear trap.\n  - Keep at least 2\u20133 safe outs for our head.\n  - Remember: we\u2019re already ahead; **we choose when the all-in happens.**\n\nLet\u2019s climb, then spread, then STRANGLE their space. \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

The board is wide open between us. They\u2019ll almost certainly keep farming the top-right cluster.\n\nPerfect. While they\u2019re farming **their** corner, we safely farm **our** top-left apples and grab the score lead. Once we\u2019re ahead? We can happily force risky chases, head-ons in tight corridors, all of it \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini plan for Future Me \ud83c\udfaf\n\nYo Future Me, remember:\n\n- This turn:  \n  - Go **UP** to (1,7).\n\n- Next few turns (if nothing crazy happens):\n  - Likely go **UP again** to (1,8) for the free apple \u2192 score 4\u20133.\n  - Strongly consider another **UP** to (1,9) for 5\u20133 if safe; you\u2019ll be a tall left column near the top with major control.\n  - From that top-left stack, start drifting **RIGHT** along row 9 or 8 to lay a horizontal bar over the center, boxing the enemy toward the right wall.\n  - With a score lead, don\u2019t fear a head-on in a tight channel if you can force it \u2014 double KO becomes OUR win condition.\n\n- Always:\n  - Avoid boxing yourself on both left and top walls at once; keep at least 2 exits.\n  - Keep your body as a big L/\u2510 shape to restrict their escape routes from the top-right.\n\nTime to climb, eat, then SQUEEZE. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nup",

Net board presence stays the same length, but we give up a free apple right above us.\n\nFuture from (0,7):\n- Can\u2019t move LEFT (wall).\n- Future options basically UP or DOWN, since RIGHT is neck.\n- We end up hugging the left wall with fewer escape vectors than if we just climbed and ate.\n\nIt\u2019s safe now but it\u2019s passive, wastes a guaranteed apple, and shrinks our future flexibility compared to going UP-then-across.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (2,7)\n\n- (2,7) is empty and safe.\n- New body: (2,7),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5) \u2014 tail (1,4) disappears.\n- We move more central, which is nice for fighting, but:\n  - We walk away from a free apple at (1,8).\n  - We still can\u2019t stop the enemy from taking (5,7) anyway.\n  - Our length doesn\u2019t increase this turn; theirs probably does.\n\nFrom (2,7) we have good mobility (UP, RIGHT, DOWN), but we\u2019re basically giving up guaranteed growth to dive into the middle with equal length. That\u2019s not the power position we want for forcing trades or boxing later.\n\nGiven we eventually want to force risky encounters when we\u2019re ahead on score/size, skipping free apples right now is just bad value.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (1,6)\n\n- Directly into our neck.\n- That\u2019s suicide.

They\u2019re far; we\u2019re safe; we\u2019re both growing, but we get a perfectly controlled shape on the left, and can start setting up the long-term squeeze.\n\n---\n\n### Plan for Future Me (next few turns)\n\n- This turn: go UP to (1,8) and lock in that free apple.\n- Next turn, if nothing crazy changes:\n  - Strongly consider UP again to (1,9) for the second free apple and a taller left column.\n  - From that top-left perch, start sliding RIGHT along row 9 (or row 8 if safer) to build a horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d over mid-board.\n- Goal: use our extra length to create an L-shaped fortress (tall on the left, wide on the top) that pushes the enemy toward the right wall.\n  - With a length/score advantage, we can start steering them into tight corridors where any head-on or panic-turn favors us.\n\nUP",

Aggressive, but safe \u2014 exactly how we win this. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n- Keeps our mobility strong and sets up a plan to channel the opponent toward the left edge.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat into the left corridor, grab the apple at (4,6) on the next move, grow, then start shifting down/left to tighten the box around the rival on column 1.

Now *we* can dictate collisions later. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFuture from (1,9):\n- Can\u2019t go UP (off board).\n- Can\u2019t go DOWN (neck at 1,8).\n- Legal: LEFT \u2192 (0,9), RIGHT \u2192 (2,9).\nSo next turn we still have **2 safe branches**. And the entire top row near us is wide open. From there we can:\n- Slide RIGHT across row 9, building a \u201cceiling\u201d over the center/right.\n- Use our extra length to eventually **box them toward the right wall** and set up either:\n  - a forced crash into our body, or\n  - a **double-head collision** when we\u2019re ahead on apples (which would *win* for us if all snakes die at once).\n\nUP gives:\n- Immediate growth.\n- Score lead.\n- Strong positional plan (left-side pillar + top ceiling).\n\nThis is exactly how we start strangling them. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\uddf1\n\n---\n\n#### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (0,8)\n- Safe: in-bounds, empty.\n- New body: (0,8),(1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5); tail (1,4) disappears \u2192 we stay length 5.\n- We **walk away from a free apple** at (1,9) that no one else can contest right now.\n\nFuture from (0,8):\n- Can\u2019t go LEFT (wall).\n- Can\u2019t go RIGHT (back into neck at 1,8).\n- Only UP (0,9) and DOWN (0,7).\nSo that\u2019s just 2 options as well, but with **no growth** and less central influence.\n\nWhy give up guaranteed value and still hug the wall with similar mobility? That\u2019s just throwing tempo away. \ud83d\udeab\n\n---\n\n#### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (2,8)\n- Safe: (2,8) is empty.\n- New body: (2,8),(1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5); tail (1,4) disappears \u2192 we stay length 5.\n- This is more central, gives us:\n  - UP (2,9),\n  - RIGHT (3,8),\n  - DOWN (2,7) next turn (LEFT would be neck).\nSo yeah, nice mobility. But\u2026 we\u2019re still **tied** in length and we give up a guaranteed apple.\n\nStrategically, we *want* to be the bigger snake so that:\n- We can bully mid-board.\n- Any all-snakes-die moment favors us on apples.\nSkipping free growth when it\u2019s completely safe? Nah, not it. \u274c\n\n---\n\n#### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (1,7)\n- That\u2019s our **neck**.\n- Instant death.\n- Auto-throw. \ud83d\ude02 Absolutely not.\n\n---\n\n### Big-picture plan (future self, listen up \ud83d\udcd3)\n\n- This turn: **UP to (1,9)**, eat that apple, go to 5 apples and length 6.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Slide RIGHT along the top (row 9), building a horizontal wall.\n  - Combine that with our left-side vertical column to create an L-shaped fortress.\n  - Use our size + positional advantage to push the enemy into the right side and:\n    - either trap them into smashing into our body,\n    - or line up a head-on trade when we\u2019re ahead on apples (double KO = our win).\n- Always track their escape lanes; when they start running out of space, we tighten the noose. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd2a\n\nWe\u2019re ahead on tempo, ahead on growth potential, and we\u2019re about to take the lead on score. Time to scale up and start plotting the kill.\n\nUP",

Time to get aggressive and start corralling this lefty. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick legal-move scan from our head (4,7):\n- UP \u2192 (4,8): EMPTY \u2014 legal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7): our neck \u2014 BACKWARDS/ILLEGAL. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7): EMPTY \u2014 legal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6): APPLE \u2014 legal and gives +1. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nEliminate death/illegal moves: RIGHT is out.\n\nEvaluate safe options:\n- UP (4,8): Keeps max mobility (UP/LEFT/RIGHT after), but doesn\u2019t immediately get apples or pressure the opponent.\n- LEFT (3,7): Moves toward the opponent\u2019s flank, helps box them later, keeps several follow-ups (2\u20133 options). Good positional play.\n- DOWN (4,6): Eats the apple now, ties the score (we go 5\u20135), grows (useful for board control), and still leaves us 3 follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) on the next turn. Also gives quick access to the apple at (4,5) below for chaining.\n\nOpponent situation: Head at (1,9) with a vertical body down column 1. They cannot immediately threaten us this turn \u2014 their options are LEFT (0,9) or RIGHT (2,9). They\u2019re boxed against column 0/1 when we start collapsing left; we should not force a head-on (they currently lead 5\u20134), so avoid reckless direct collisions.\n\nDecision logic: We want to be aggressive but sensible. Eating (4,6) ties apples and gives growth so we can start to dominate the left corridor. Growth plus proximity gives us better control to channel the rival toward column 0/1 and then tighten the noose. We\u2019ll avoid forcing a head-on until we have the apple advantage.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- DOWN now to eat (4,6). Chain to (4,5) next turn if safe to keep apples and length.\n- Pivot left after securing apples to start hemming the rival in along column 1.\n- Maintain \u22652 escape options each turn; only force collision when we clearly have the apple lead.\n\nLet\u2019s eat and start closing the box.

          "rationale": "Alright chat, we\u2019re back on the sticks \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d Time to COOK.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Our head: (1,9), body down to (1,4) \u2013 big vertical wall on x=1.\n- Enemy head: (4,7), coiled around (5\u20136,7\u20138).\n- Score: we\u2019re UP 5\u20134. That means any double-KO **wins for us**. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nWe move from (1,9). Remember: all moves are simultaneous.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves for instant death\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,10)**  \n  Off the board \u2192 instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,8)**  \n  That\u2019s our neck, moving backwards into our own body \u2192 instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,9)**  \n  In-bounds, empty right now \u2192 *safe this turn*.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,9)**  \n  In-bounds, empty \u2192 *safe this turn*.\n\nEnemy from (4,7) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (4,8) (empty),\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7) (empty),\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6) (apple),\n- RIGHT is illegal (back into neck at (5,7)).\n\nNone of those squares are (0,9) or (2,9), so **no head-on collision** this turn no matter what we do. We just need to pick the best *position*.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the two safe options\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (0,9)\nSounds chill hugging the corner, right? But check the follow-up:\n\nIf we go to (0,9), our new body:\n- (0,9),(1,9),(1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5)\n\nNext turn from (0,9):\n- UP \u2192 off board (dead)\n- LEFT \u2192 off board (dead)\n- RIGHT \u2192 back into neck at (1,9) (illegal)\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,8) is the **only** legal move\n\nSo going LEFT **forces** us into exactly one move next turn. That\u2019s basically walking into a tunnel with no steering wheel. One bad enemy pivot and we\u2019re cooked. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nWe do NOT want to give up flexibility when the whole mid/right side is open.\n\n---\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (2,9)\nIf we go RIGHT, our new body:\n- (2,9),(1,9),(1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5)\n\nNext turn from (2,9):\n- UP \u2192 off board (dead)\n- LEFT \u2192 neck (1,9) (illegal)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,9)** (open top lane)\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,8)** (drops into the central arena)\n\nSo after going RIGHT, we still have **two good options**:\n- Keep sliding right along the top, building a **ceiling** over the enemy.\n- Drop down into the middle when it\u2019s tactically good (to cut them off or contest apples).\n\nPositionally:\n- Our vertical wall at x=1 + a horizontal stretch along y=9 = an L-shaped barrier.\n- The enemy is already more to the right; if they start going DOWN for apples (4,6 \u2192 4,5 \u2192 4,4, etc.), we can claim the whole top and then swing down later to box them in.\n\nWe maintain:\n- Board control,\n- Flexibility,\n- And we\u2019re still up 5\u20134 on apples, ready to force a double-KO later if the line is good.\n\nLEFT gives us **one** forced move next turn. RIGHT keeps us **nimble and dominant**. Easy choice.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short long-term plan (future me, read this \ud83d\udc40)\n\n- This turn: go **RIGHT** to (2,9).\n- If enemy starts farming downwards (likely DOWN to (4,6) apple), we:\n  - extend along the top (3,9 \u2192 4,9 \u2192 5,9), creating a strong top wall.\n  - When we\u2019ve got length + positional edge, look for a timing to:\n    - drop down in front of their path to cut off escape lanes, or\n    - set up a **deliberate head-on collision** when they can\u2019t dodge (remember, we\u2019re ahead on apples, so double-KO is a win).\n- Always avoid corners that leave us with just a single legal move (like (0,9)); prioritize having **2+ safe outs** every turn.\n\nWe\u2019re playing for the slow suffocation: own the top, then squeeze from above. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd27\n\nRIGHT",

Instead pressure and shrink their space.\n\nEvaluation and choice:\n- DOWN gives an apple and growth \u2014 tempting \u2014 but moves us away from the choke we want to build and doesn\u2019t immediately limit the rival.\n- RIGHT also eats but reduces our mobility upward (because (5,7) is occupied), making us easier to trap later.\n- LEFT (3,6) is the aggressive positional play: it gets us closer to column 2\u20133, starts corralling the opponent toward column 0/1, and keeps multiple escape/follow-up options (UP, LEFT, DOWN after the move). It maintains flexibility while increasing board control.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to begin collapsing space around them.\n- Watch their reaction: if they try to slip right/down, cut across to seal column 2.\n- Only force a head-on when we have the apple advantage or clearly win the collision \u2014 otherwise keep boxing and collect apples opportunistically.\n\nLet\u2019s get in their face and start tightening the noose.

We\u2019re entering brawl range **without** advantage.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate RIGHT \u2192 (3,9)\n\nIf we go **RIGHT**:\n\n- New body:\n  - Head: (3,9)\n  - Then: (2,9),(1,9),(1,8),(1,7),(1,6)  \n  (Tail (1,5) disappears.)\n\nWe now have:\n- A vertical wall at x=1, y=6\u20139\n- A growing horizontal line across the top at y=9 from x=1\u21923\n\nNext turn options from (3,9):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,10)** = off board, dead\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,9)** = neck, illegal\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,9)** = currently empty\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,8)** = currently empty  \n\nSo again **2 safe outs: RIGHT, DOWN**.\n\nPositional benefits:\n- We keep building a **ceiling** above the enemy.\n- We stay out of immediate tangle range while they farm mid-board apples.\n- We keep a clean option to **drop down later** into the center from a stronger, more extended position.\n- We stay closer to the strong top apples line: (7,9) and (8,9) are future value once we\u2019re safe to pick them up.\n\nEnemy likely behavior?\n- They just took (4,6) last turn (apple), so they clearly like going for food.\n- Now they\u2019re very likely to grab **(4,5)** or **(5,6)** for more apples.\n- That pulls them **downward**, into the middle of the board, while we:\n  - Own the top,\n  - Build length safely,\n  - Reserve the right to come crashing down on them when we finally get the apple lead.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of **strategic aggression** we want: not random brawling, but **setups**.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note to future me \ud83d\ude0f\n\n- Keep sliding **RIGHT along the top** as long as it\u2019s safe; form a long horizontal wall above the enemy.\n- Watch where enemy dives for apples:\n  - If they commit downward into the middle/bottom, we:\n    - Secure top-right apples (7,9) and (8,9) **if** it doesn\u2019t compromise safety.\n    - Then look for a timing to drop **DOWN** somewhere around x=4\u20136 to start sealing off escape routes.\n- The moment we\u2019re **up on apples**, we can start engineering forced corridors that lead to:\n  - them slamming into our body, or\n  - a **forced head-on** they can\u2019t dodge (we win the tiebreak if we\u2019re ahead).\n- Avoid cornering ourselves on the top-right edge without an exit lane down; always keep at least **two safe moves** open.\n\nWe\u2019re not running.

Keeps multiple follow-ups (L/R/UP next turn), stays in the fight column. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (2,7): legal but dangerous \u2014 adjacent to their body at (1,7), reduces safe exits and can hand them an escape corridor. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (4,7): our body \u2014 immediate death. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (3,6): into our neck \u2014 illegal/backwards. \u274c\n\nOpponent options from (4,9): DOWN to (4,8) or RIGHT to (5,9). They CANNOT go left (neck) or up (offboard). They also can\u2019t reach (3,8) this turn, so UP is safe from an immediate head-on.\n\nWhy UP is the move:\n- Keeps pressure straight at their column without cornering ourselves. We maintain multiple safe follow-ups from (3,8) (LEFT or RIGHT or UP), which preserves options to pivot and trap. \ud83e\udde0\n- If they go DOWN to (4,8), we can threaten the vertical corridor and follow pressure without risking a head-on (they can\u2019t legally cut into (3,8) next turn). If they go RIGHT to (5,9), we can pivot and chase while using our central body to hem them in.\n- LEFT is tempting but hands them leverage around column 1 where their body sits \u2014 too risky while apples are tied. We avoid an unnecessary head-on since scores are equal.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move UP now to get into (3,8) and keep options open.\n- If they drop to (4,8), pressure downward and look to cut off sideways escape (use RIGHT/LEFT pivots from (3,8)).\n- If they run RIGHT to (5,9), chase and close the gap centrally; only force a head-on if we gain the apple advantage or it\u2019s a guaranteed win.\n- Always prefer squares that leave 2+ safe follow-ups \u2014 don\u2019t get boxed on column 1 or against their body chain.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the choke tight and make him sweat.

That\u2019s a mess for them.\n\nSo by going RIGHT:\n- We set up to farm **(7,9)** and **(8,9)** almost for free.\n- We get a likely **length / apple lead** soon.\n- Once we\u2019re ahead, **forcing a head-on** suddenly becomes **GOOD FOR US**:\n  - Double KO with us having more apples = **we win**. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nPositionally, from (6,9):\n- Next turn:\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) apple \ud83c\udf4e\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,8) to start dropping into right side if we ever need to.\n- Long term, we can:\n  - Extend to **(9,9)**, then drop down the **right wall**, and start **sweeping left** under them to BOX them in against our giant top bar. That\u2019s the trap setup, chat. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nCompare vibes:\n- **DOWN** = jump into a fair fight now.\n- **RIGHT** = secure resources, extend control, THEN crush them with superior length and space.\n\nWe\u2019re not here for \u201cfair fights\u201d. We\u2019re here to **dominate the lobby**. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- Keep sliding **RIGHT along the top** as long as:\n  - We have at least one safe **DOWN** escape.\n  - Enemy can\u2019t threaten a weird ladder into us.\n- Prioritize grabbing **(7,9)** then **(8,9)** for a **clear apple/length lead**.\n- After we extend toward the **right edge**, plan to:\n  - Drop **DOWN** along the right side (9,x),\n  - Then sweep **LEFT** under them,\n  - Using our big horizontal wall at y=9 as the \u201clid\u201d of the box.\n- Once we\u2019re ahead in apples, actively look for:\n  - **Forced head-ons** where they HAVE to collide with us and lose on score,\n  - Or choking off their last escape channels so they crash into our body.\n\nTime to keep roofing them in and farm up, chat. We take the **safe power spike** line here. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Quick clean read of the four options from our head (5,8):\n\n- UP -> (5,9): Occupied by opponent body. Instant death if we go there. NOPE.  \n- LEFT -> (4,8): Our neck (backwards). Illegal. NOPE.  \n- RIGHT -> (6,8): Empty now but directly contested by the opponent if they go DOWN from (7,9). That would be a head-on collision. We\u2019re trailing 5 \u2192 6, so we should NOT force a head-on. TOO RISKY.  \n- DOWN -> (5,7): Apple! Safe, not our body, and gives us +1 to tie the score 6\u20136. Also leaves multiple follow-up exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN next turn) so we won\u2019t get boxed immediately.\n\nDecision rationale: take the apple and avoid the head-on gamble. Grabbing (5,7) ties apples and increases board control \u2014 we grow, gain mobility (multiple exits next turn), and keep the initiative. If the opponent goes RIGHT to the apple at (8,9), we can chase and cut escapes later; if they go DOWN, we don\u2019t collide because we won\u2019t be moving into (6,8) this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Eat (5,7) now to tie score and grow.  \n- From there, keep lateral options (use (4,7) or (6,7) or (5,6)) to avoid getting funneled.  \n- Only force a head-on if we have the apple lead \u2014 otherwise bait them toward the wall and trap. Stay aggressive but alive.\n\nFinal move:\nDOWN",

Still enough mobility to avoid immediate box-in while gaining tempo. \ud83e\udded\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (5,6) to tie the score and grow.

That\u2019s straight into our body. Instant suicide. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- LEFT -> (4,6) is our tail. Moving into the tail is technically possible if the tail vacates this turn (we\u2019re not eating), and the opponent can\u2019t contest that cell this turn. It\u2019s safe-but-passive. Could be useful for a tight maneuver, but it doesn't pressure the enemy. \ud83e\udd0f\n- DOWN -> (5,5) is empty and safe. It\u2019s passive and moves us away from the opponent (increases distance). Not ideal for aggression. \ud83d\uded1\n- RIGHT -> (6,6) is empty and safe. Cuts the Manhattan distance to the enemy (from 5 \u2192 4), keeps multiple follow-up options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT available next turn), and starts to close the gap toward their territory. Aggressive, controlled, and not a forced head-on while we\u2019re tied. \u2705\ud83d\udd25\n\nEnemy head check: Opponent at (8,8). Their immediate moves are limited to LEFT (7,8), DOWN (8,7), or RIGHT (9,8). None of those create a head-on with our potential move RIGHT into (6,6) this turn. We\u2019re tied 7\u20137, so we should avoid intentional head-on trades; instead pressure and box. \ud83d\udc40\n\nShort long-term plan (quick tactical note to myself before the move):\n- Move RIGHT to (6,6) to close distance and keep 3 exits.\n- Next turns, push UP toward row 8 while building length to form a vertical fence around x=6\u20137 to hem the rival toward the top/right wall.\n- Avoid forcing a head-on until we have the lead or a clear trap; instead use superior positioning and board control to cut off escape routes and then force collisions.

          "rationale": "Alright chat, we\u2019re back at it. Current head is at (8,8), we\u2019re snaking across the top, enemy is clustered slightly below us around x=3\u20135, y=6\u20138. Scores tied 7\u20137, lengths equal.\n\nWe need to pick a move that:\n- Keeps us alive this turn (no walls, no bodies, no dumb backtracks)\n- Preserves GOOD future options (not getting funneled into a dead corridor)\n- Keeps pressure on the enemy side of the board\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all 4 directions from (8,8)\n\n**UP \u2192 (8,9)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body segment and it\u2019s directly behind our head (our neck).  \n- Moving backwards into your own body is instant death.  \n\u2192 Illegal.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- On board.\n- Currently empty: no T, no 0, no 1 there.\n- Enemy at (5,6) cannot reach (7,8) in one move.  \n\u2192 Safe this turn.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n- On board.\n- Empty square.\n- Enemy cannot reach (9,8) this turn either.  \n\u2192 Safe this turn.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (8,7)**  \n- On board.\n- Empty square.\n- Enemy cannot reach (8,7) this turn.  \n\u2192 Safe this turn.\n\nSo legal candidates: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Predict enemy\u2019s move\n\nEnemy head: (5,6). Their body: (5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(3,7),(3,6),(4,6).\n\nFrom (5,6), what can they do?\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,7): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6): that\u2019s their own body \u2192 suicide.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6): empty \u2192 legal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5): apple \u2192 legal.\n\nSo realistically, they have two sensible moves:  \n- RIGHT to (6,6)  \n- DOWN to (5,5) and grow.\n\nWe must be safe vs both.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Evaluate each of our moves with future flexibility\n\n#### A) RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)\n\nAfter we move:\n- Our head: (9,8)\n- Our body: (8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9),(3,9)\n\nNext turn from (9,8), ignoring enemy for a second:\n- UP \u2192 (9,9)\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,7)\n- LEFT is backwards into (8,8), illegal\n- RIGHT is off-board\n\nSo superficially 2 moves, but:\n- UP to (9,9) is a near-dead-end: from (9,9), the only neighboring cells are off-board, our body, or straight backwards. That\u2019s a future self-trap.\n- Realistically the only healthy continuation from (9,8) is DOWN to (9,7).\n\nSo RIGHT this turn basically funnels us straight down the right wall with very limited wiggle.\n\nAgainst either enemy move (to (6,6) or (5,5)), (9,7) will still be safe next turn, but our shape becomes a tall, narrow column on the right. Easy to over-commit, hard to pivot.\n\nVerdict: Playable, but strategically stiff and less flexible.\n\n---\n\n#### B) LEFT \u2192 (7,8)\n\nAfter we move:\n- Our head: (7,8)\n- Our body: (8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9),(3,9)\n\nNow, next turn from (7,8):\n- UP \u2192 (7,9): our own body \u2192 illegal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8): empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7): empty.\n\nSo we have exactly **2 real options**: LEFT to (6,8) and DOWN to (7,7).\n\nCheck vs enemy\u2019s two possible moves:\n\n1) Enemy DOWN to (5,5):  \n   - Their head ends at (5,5), body extends around x=3\u20135.\n   - Our future squares (6,8) and (7,7) are far and clear.\n\n2) Enemy RIGHT to (6,6):  \n   - Head at (6,6), body at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8),(3,7),(3,6).\n   - Still no overlap with (6,8) or (7,7).\n\nSo LEFT this turn keeps **2** safe follow-ups no matter what they do and nudges us closer to center/closer to them. That\u2019s more aggressive but also brings more interaction earlier.\n\n---\n\n#### C) DOWN \u2192 (8,7)\n\nAfter we move:\n- Our head: (8,7)\n- Our body: (8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9),(3,9)\n\nFrom (8,7) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (8,8): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7): currently empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7): apple.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6): empty.\n\nSo we have **3 candidate moves** (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) that are all clean based on the board.\n\nNow check vs enemy possibilities:\n\n1) Enemy DOWN to (5,5):  \n   - They shift further down-left, nowhere near our three neighbor cells.\n   - (7,7),(9,7),(8,6) all remain clear next turn.\n\n2) Enemy RIGHT to (6,6):  \n   - Head at (6,6), their body blobs around columns 3\u20135.\n   - Still no contest for (7,7),(9,7),(8,6); all remain safe.\n\nSo DOWN keeps **3** safe, non-suicidal directions open on the following turn against any rational enemy move. That\u2019s strictly more flexible than LEFT (2 options) and much healthier than RIGHT (effectively 1 good path).\n\nPositionally, DOWN:\n- Keeps us in the upper-right quadrant but not slammed against the wall.\n- Lets us decide next turn whether to:\n  - Swing RIGHT to start forming that right-wall column while still having exits, or\n  - Swing LEFT/DOWN toward center to pressure the opponent\u2019s space.\n\nWe stay above and to the right of them, with the ability to pivot.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Strategic vibe check\n\n- Apples tied 7\u20137, equal lengths. We do not want a random head-on; it would just be a draw.\n- Our top-row wall from x=3\u20138 already limits their vertical escape.\n- Sliding DOWN to (8,7) keeps:\n  - Maximum future choices.\n  - Control of the upper-right.\n  - The option to grab right-side apples later to outgrow them and then look for a winning collision, not a drawn one.\n\nCommitting hard to the right wall now (RIGHT) narrows our options too early. Sliding LEFT now gets us closer but costs us some flexibility compared to DOWN.\n\nGiven all that, the best balance of aggression and safety is to drop one more row and keep the branching high.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future self\n\nFrom (8,7), prioritize:\n- Staying in the upper-right but with at least 2 safe moves each turn.\n- If enemy drifts down/left, start carving a controlled descent on the right side to farm apples and grow.\n- If enemy comes toward us, use our vertical advantage to drop below them and sweep laterally, aiming to shrink their space while keeping a full escape lane for ourselves.\n- Do not take a head-on unless we\u2019ve established a clear apple lead.\n\nDOWN",

Legal. \u2705\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,6)**  \n  Empty tile. Legal. \u2705\n\nSo candidates: **LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head at (6,6). From there:\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,7) \u2013 empty, legal \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5) \u2013 empty, sets up for apple at (6,4) later \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) \u2013 empty, legal \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6) \u2013 backwards into neck \u274c\n\nSo opponent has three realistic moves: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\nWe need moves that are:\n- Safe vs all three options,\n- Keep good follow-ups,\n- Avoid easy head-on setups **for now** (scores tied),\n- Let us grow into control.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate our options\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe2 Option A: RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) (apple)\n\nImmediate result:\n- We eat the apple \u2192 score becomes **8\u20137 in our favor** \ud83d\udcb0\n- New body: (9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9),(3,9)\n\nCheck safety this turn:\n- (9,7) was empty+apple.\n- Enemy from (6,6) cannot reach (9,7) in one move. No head-on, no body collision. \u2705\n\nNext turn from our new head (9,7):\n\nNeighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (9,8) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 our own body (neck), illegal\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board\n\nSo we have **two clean follow-ups**: UP and DOWN.\n\nBut are they good?\n\n- Going **UP** from (9,7) to (9,8) quickly leads us into the top-right corner and low-mobility. That\u2019s a line we should generally NOT take unless forced.\n- Going **DOWN** from (9,7) to (9,6) opens a **ladder** of apples on the right side:\n  - (9,5), (9,3), (9,1) all down that column\n  - Plus left options into (8,6),(8,5),(8,4) later\n\nEnemy after their move (UP / DOWN / RIGHT) is all clustered around x=6\u20137, far from our 9-column. They can\u2019t threaten (9,6) or those right-column apples for several turns.\n\nSo RIGHT gives:\n- **Immediate lead** in apples and length,\n- Access to a **rich, mostly uncontested apple highway** on the right wall,\n- Safe spacing from the enemy \u2192 minimal head-on risk while scores are close.\n\nThat\u2019s huge.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe1 Option B: DOWN \u2192 (8,6)\n\nAfter move:\n- New body: (8,6),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9)\n\nNext-turn neighbors from (8,6):\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 backwards into neck \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2013 empty now\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) \u2013 apple \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo we have **three** nice options next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), and DOWN hits an apple soon. Very flexible.\n\nBut relationship to enemy:\n- If enemy chooses **RIGHT** this turn, they land at (7,6), right next to our new head (8,6).\n- That puts us in immediate close-quarters with equal length and almost equal score.\n- Next turn, lots of squares become contested, raising the odds of some awkward head-on or mutual trap while we\u2019re not yet clearly ahead.\n\nDOWN is flexible and solid, but it drags us into a knife fight in the center-right sooner. That\u2019s riskier while the score is tied.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe0 Option C: LEFT \u2192 (7,7)\n\nAfter move:\n- New body: (7,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9)\n\nNext-turn neighbors from (7,7):\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) \u2013 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) \u2013 might be enemy\u2019s head if they chose UP\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 backwards into neck, illegal\n\nSo we\u2019ll have **2\u20133 candidate moves**, but we\u2019re walking **toward** the enemy cluster.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (6,7), we\u2019re now directly adjacent and sharing a lot of contested tiles. Again, with equal/currently-tied scores, we actually *don\u2019t* want symmetrical high-contact fights yet. We want to get **bigger first**, then bully.\n\nLEFT is the most \u201caggressive chase\u201d option, but it also maximizes head-on risk early.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic call\n\nWhat do we want right now?\n\n- We **can\u2019t win if we die**.\n- The best way to win is:\n  - Get a **clear apple/length lead**,\n  - Then use body + position to force *him* into bad trades:\n    - crashing into our body,\n    - taking a head-on when we\u2019re ahead.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT to (9,7)** does exactly that:\n- Safe this turn vs all enemy moves,\n- Gives +1 apple immediately \u2192 we lead 8\u20137,\n- Opens a clean apple ladder down the right side,\n- Keeps distance, reducing dumb head-ons while tied,\n- Still leaves us with multiple safe future moves (and a clear main plan: go down the right, then pivot left into space).\n\nDOWN and LEFT are playable, but they invite high-contact fights *before* we\u2019ve established that lead. That\u2019s not the grind we want yet.\n\nSo we grab the free value and take over the right side. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From (9,7), **avoid going UP** into the top-right corner unless forced; that path chokes options.\n- Prefer going **down the right wall** to scoop (9,5), (9,3), (9,1) and stack a serious apple/length lead.\n- As you descend, keep at least **two exits open**:\n  - straight down the 9-column,\n  - or left into column 8/7 when enemy pathing allows.\n- Keep an eye on enemy if they drift down toward center/bottom:\n  - Once we\u2019re 2\u20133 apples ahead, start angling leftward to fence them into the left/center and cut escape lanes.\n  - Look for chances where a head-on collision would favor us (we\u2019re longer and ahead on apples) and steer toward those races.\n- Never let them sneak behind us into the right wall corridor; keep our body as the outer boundary.\n\nRIGHT",

Instant suicide. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT -> (8,6) = open now, pushes toward their flank and gives DOWN->apple (8,5) or RIGHT->(9,6). BUT UP from (8,6) is (8,7) which is occupied by their body \u2014 could limit our vertical pressure. Risk: gets a bit cramped near their segments. \ud83e\udd14\n- UP -> (7,7) = clean, safe, directly pressures their left-top approach, keeps multiple exits (UP to 7,8, RIGHT to 8,7 blocked by them but DOWN and RIGHT still usable later). Forces them to react to vertical squeeze without risking an immediate head-on. Perfect for corralling into the top/right. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udce6\n- DOWN -> (7,5) = safe but passive.

We\u2019re behind 7\u20138, so we should NOT force a head-on. We need to tighten the box and deny exits.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns (so I remember on the next clip): push UP to (7,7) to start building vertical pressure along x=6\u20137, deny their left-side escapes, bait them toward the top edge, then collapse the gap or force a risky move when they\u2019re cramped.

Feels like walking into a cage. \ud83d\ude2c\n- DOWN -> (7,6): immediate suicide (that\u2019s our neck). No way. \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT -> (8,7): dead \u2014 their body sits there.

Deny their escapes along the top-left corridor and bait them toward the right edge. Grow when safe to lengthen the wall \u2014 force them into tighter moves and only threaten a head-on if we regain the apple lead.

One-point lead, so head-on trades favor us later, but only if we make it there alive and bigger.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves\n\n**UP \u2192 (9,7)**  \n- That\u2019s our neck. Directly backwards into our own body. Instant death. Out.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (10,6)**  \n- Off the board. Instant death. Out.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8,6)**  \n- Currently empty.\n- Not our body, not their body.\n- Enemy at (7,7) cannot move to (8,6) in one step, so no head-on this turn.\n- So LEFT is safe this turn.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9,5)**  \n- There is an apple at (9,5).\n- Not our body, not their body.\n- Enemy cannot reach (9,5) from (7,7) in one move.\n- So DOWN is also safe, and we grow +1.\n\nSo we\u2019re choosing between **LEFT** and **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Compare LEFT vs DOWN\n\n#### If we go LEFT to (8,6)\n\nNew us: head (8,6), then (9,6),(9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9)  \nTail moves up from (4,9) to (5,9).\n\nEnemy from (7,7) realistically has two sane moves:\n- **UP \u2192 (7,8)** or\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n(RIGHT into our body or DOWN into their body are suicidal; they\u2019re behind on apples, so they shouldn\u2019t do that.)\n\nWorst-case for our flexibility: they go **UP \u2192 (7,8)**.\n\nFrom our new head (8,6):\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) = our own body (illegal).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) = our neck (illegal).\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) = enemy body after they move UP; would be suicide next turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) = apple, and our only real safe move.\n\nSo after going LEFT now, we\u2019re funneled into exactly one safe direction next turn: DOWN to (8,5). That\u2019s not instant death, but it does limit our flexibility and makes our route more predictable. Still playable, but slightly constrained.\n\n#### If we go DOWN to (9,5)\n\nWe eat the apple, grow, and end up:\n\nHead: (9,5)  \nBody after growth: (9,6),(9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9)\n\nEnemy again chooses **UP \u2192 (7,8)** or **LEFT \u2192 (6,7)**.\n\nFrom our new head (9,5):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,6) = our neck (illegal).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,5) = off-board (illegal).\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) = apple, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4) = empty, safe.\n\nSo after going DOWN we still have **two** good options (LEFT to apple or DOWN to space), and we\u2019ve banked a clean +1 apple, pushing the score to 9\u20137. More apples, more length, and more future options than the LEFT line.\n\nStrategically:\n- We maintain a strong vertical body-wall on the right side that\u2019s hard for the enemy to slip around.\n- We get immediate growth, widening the lead.\n- We keep multiple exits open next turn instead of being funneled.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of position you want when you\u2019re ahead and looking to dominate the map.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Short plan to future self\n\n- Take **DOWN to (9,5)** now and lock in the free apple, stretching the lead to 9\u20137.\n- From (9,5), watch the enemy\u2019s direction:\n  - If they drift upward/left, keep riding the right side: consider moving DOWN toward (9,3)/(9,1) or LEFT to (8,5) when it gives you more space and angles.\n- Use your growing body as a vertical barrier on the right, then later pivot left across the board to slice off their escape routes.\n- Once you\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and board control, start looking for lines that either:\n  - Force them into your body, or\n  - Offer a favorable head-on collision they can\u2019t dodge without dying some other way.\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s do the 4-way check from our HEAD (6,7) and pick the clean play.\n\nImmediate 4-way scan:\n- UP -> (6,8): FREE right now. Not occupied by either snake. Good escape/outlet. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (7,7): OUR NECK \u2014 moving backwards into ourselves = instant suicide. \u274c\n- DOWN -> (6,6): occupied by our own body. Dead. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (5,7): occupied by our body. Dead. \u274c\n\nHead-on / opponent threat assessment:\n- Opponent head (9,5) cannot reach (6,8) this turn, so no immediate head-on into our UP. They\u2019re more likely to go LEFT to (8,5) (apple) or DOWN to (9,4). We\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 9) so we DO NOT want to force a risky head-on trade \u2014 we need survival and positional pressure, not a mutual KO. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nRisk summary: ALL other moves are illegal (backing into our body); UP is the only safe option and it keeps options open. Note: the row above has enemy body further north at (6,9), so don\u2019t double-UP blindly next turn \u2014 we\u2019ll use (6,8) to pivot and start pressuring/walling toward the enemy flank while avoiding head-on trades.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to get out of the cramped pocket and create lateral pressure.\n- From (6,8) pivot to threaten their left approach, force them toward the right edge/apples, and grow only when it helps form a blocking wall.\n- Keep exits open; avoid chasing apples into traps.

Current state\n\nOur snake (ID 1):\n- Head: (9,5)  \n- Body: (9,6),(9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9)  \n- Apples: 9\n\nEnemy snake #0:\n- Head: (6,7)  \n- Body: (7,7),(7,6),(6,6),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(4,8)  \n- Apples: 7\n\nWe\u2019re up **9\u20137** on apples. Good lead, and our body is a big wall wrapping the top and right side.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy\u2019s move this turn\n\nFrom (6,7), what can the enemy do?\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,8): empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): their own body \u2192 instant death.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7): their own body \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): their neck/backwards + body \u2192 death.\n\nSo if they want to stay alive, they are **forced to go UP to (6,8)**. That\u2019s huge: we can treat their move as known.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Our legal moves\n\nFrom our head (9,5):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,6): our own body (neck) \u2192 illegal / death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,5): off-board \u2192 death.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5): **apple, empty now, safe.**\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4): **empty, safe.**\n\nSo the only safe options: **LEFT** and **DOWN**.\n\nWe need to check both, assuming enemy goes to (6,8).\n\n---\n\n### 4. If we go DOWN to (9,4)\n\n- We do **not** eat an apple.\n- New us:\n  - Head: (9,4)\n  - Body: (9,5),(9,6),(9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9)  \n    (tail (4,9) disappears)\n- Enemy goes UP to (6,8).\n\nResult:\n- We stay pinned to the right wall and slide downward.\n- Next turn from (9,4) we only have **two** legal moves:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,4) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,3) (apple)\n- Position is safe and still good, but we give up central control and don\u2019t immediately grow.\n\n---\n\n### 5. If we go LEFT to (8,5)\n\nThis is the spicy line.\n\n- We move LEFT onto **apple at (8,5)** \u2192 we **grow**.\n- New us:\n  - Head: (8,5)\n  - Body (no tail removed because of growth):  \n    (9,5),(9,6),(9,7),(8,7),(8,8),(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(5,9),(4,9)\n- Enemy goes UP to (6,8).\n\nNow look at the follow-up from here:\n\nNext turn, from head (8,5), our raw options:\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,6): empty and safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5): empty and safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4): empty and safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5): our neck \u2192 illegal.\n\nSo after going LEFT now we\u2019ll have **three** good options next turn vs only two if we go DOWN. More flexibility = less chance of getting boxed ourselves.\n\nEven better: enemy at (6,8) will **again** have only one safe move next turn:\n\n- From (6,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (6,9): our body (we still hold the top wall) \u2192 they die.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,8): their body \u2192 die.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,7): their body/backwards \u2192 die.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): empty \u2192 **only safe move**.\n\nSo the sequence is basically forced:\n\n- This turn:  \n  - We go **LEFT to (8,5)** (eat apple, go up 10\u20137).  \n  - They go **UP to (6,8)**.\n- Next turn (most powerful continuation):  \n  - From (8,5) we can go **UP to (8,6)**.  \n  - They are forced RIGHT to (7,8).\n\nThen they land at (7,8) with all neighbors either their own body or **our body above and to the right**. On the following turn they are effectively out of moves; any direction is death into a body. That\u2019s exactly the box we want.\n\nSo:\n- LEFT this turn keeps us safe.\n- Immediately grabs an apple, stretching the score to **10\u20137**.\n- Increases our future move options.\n- Directly feeds into a forced trap line that suffocates them in the top-center.\n\nDOWN is playable, but strictly worse: less food, less central control, fewer options. Why give that up when we can choke them out?\n\n---\n\n### 6. Short plan for future self\n\n- Take **LEFT to (8,5)** now to eat the apple and maintain our horizontal presence below the enemy.\n- Next turn, strongly consider **UP from (8,5)** to (8,6). This tightens the net while enemy is forced to drift to (7,8).\n- Once they\u2019re jammed between our top wall and our side wall, they\u2019ll run out of legal moves and die into either their own body or ours.\n- After they\u2019re gone, use our massive body to farm remaining apples and cruise to a dominant finish without risking a stupid head-on.\n\nLEFT",

We want to box, not blunder.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy\u2019s options this turn\n\nEnemy at (6,8):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,9)**: our body \u2192 they die.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**: their own body \u2192 death.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**: their own body (tail or not, it\u2019s body) \u2192 death.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**: empty \u2192 **only safe move**.\n\nSo they are **forced to go RIGHT to (7,8)** if they don\u2019t want to instantly explode.\n\nWe can treat their move as basically known: enemy \u2192 **(7,8)**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Our legal moves right now\n\nFrom our head (8,5):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,6)**: empty, no apple \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)**: empty, no apple \u2192 safe.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)**: empty, no apple \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)**: our own neck \u2192 **illegal / instant death**.\n\nSo candidates: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 What happens after they move to (7,8)? Are they actually trapped?\n\nAfter this turn, if enemy goes to (7,8), their neighbors will be:\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,9): our body.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8): our body.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7): their body.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8): their body.\n\nNone of those are tails. None will be vacated next turn. So next turn:\n> **They will have 0 safe moves no matter what we do now.**  \nThey are **guaranteed** to die on the following turn.\n\nOur choice this turn is about:\n- making sure **we** still have safe options next turn, and  \n- not accidentally boxing **ourselves** in while boxing them in.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Check each of our moves for future safety\n\n#### Option A: UP to (8,6)\n\nOur new head: (8,6). After both snakes move:\n\n- Our neighbors next turn from (8,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (8,7): our body.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,5): our own neck.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,6): enemy body.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,6): our body.\n\nResult: **we would have 0 safe moves next turn.**\n\nSo going UP now means:\n- Next turn: **we and the enemy are both completely trapped.**\n- We\u2019d be forced into a mutual-death turn.\n- We still win on apples (10\u20137), but we die too.\n\nCan we win like that? Yes.  \nDo we *need* to die? Absolutely not \ud83d\ude02\n\n---\n\n#### Option B: LEFT to (7,5)\n\nAfter enemy goes to (7,8), and we go to (7,5):\n\n- Our neighbors next turn from (7,5):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,6): enemy body \u2192 death.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,4): apple, empty \u2192 **safe**.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,5): empty \u2192 **safe**.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,5): our neck \u2192 death.\n\nSo with LEFT, **we keep 2 safe moves** next turn.\n\nEnemy at (7,8) still has 0 safe moves. They\u2019re dead next turn; we can easily sidestep and live.\n\n---\n\n#### Option C: DOWN to (8,4)\n\nAfter moves (us DOWN, them RIGHT):\n\n- Our neighbors next turn from (8,4):\n  - UP \u2192 (8,5): our neck.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,3): empty \u2192 **safe**.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,4): apple \u2192 **safe**.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,4): empty \u2192 **safe**.\n\nSo with DOWN, **we keep 3 safe moves** next turn.\n\nEnemy is still at (7,8) with 0 safe options. Completely boxed.\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move is best?\n\nAll three **keep us alive this turn**.  \nAll three keep the **enemy fully doomed next turn**.\n\nThe differences:\n\n- **UP** guarantees a mutual death next turn (we win by apples, but still die).\n- **LEFT** keeps us safe with 2 follow-ups.\n- **DOWN** keeps us safest with **3** follow-ups and moves us toward a big apple cluster on the lower half.\n\nFollowing the rules (\u201camong safe moves, keep multiple safe follow-ups and get closer to apples\u201d), **DOWN** is the cleanest, highest-option, lowest-risk play.\n\nWe still box the enemy completely. They have no way out. Next turn we just dodge while they slam into a wall of bodies and disappear \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Plan for future self\n\n- Expect enemy this turn to go **RIGHT to (7,8)**.\n- After we go **DOWN to (8,4)**, we\u2019ll have 3 good moves: LEFT to the apple at (7,4), DOWN to (8,3), or RIGHT to (9,4).\n- Next turn, **do NOT** move into any of the enemy-adjacent walls just for style; let them crash into our body or their own. We want:  \n  - they die,  \n  - we stay alive,  \n  - we win instantly on \u201clast snake standing + higher apples\u201d.\n\nDOWN",

Time to think fast.\n\nQuick 4-way check from our head at (7,8):\n\n- UP -> (7,9): OCCUPIED by opponent body (segment at (7,9)). Instant death if we go there. \u274c  \n- LEFT -> (6,8): OUR NECK. Backwards into ourselves = immediate death. \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (7,7): OCCUPIED by our own body. Dead. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (8,8): OCCUPIED by opponent body (segment at (8,8)). Also death by moving into a body. \u274c\n\nReality check: every adjacent cell is occupied right now. We're trapped \u2014 there are no legal safe escapes that avoid death this turn given the strict rule that moving into any snake body (including ours) is death. Sucks, but the math is the math. \ud83d\udc80\n\nSo what do we do? Pick the least-worst option that maximizes chaos and gives us the slimmest chance to take someone with us or at least not give them a clean follow-up win. We should:\n- Aim to collide in a way that could possibly create a multi-death or force the opponent into a bad move on their next tick.  \n- If we can't survive, prioritize moves that avoid giving the opponent an easy apple or free real estate after we die. Be ruthless \u2014 go down swinging. \u2694\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay / next rationale if we somehow don't immediately die): if we survive a tick, funnel them into the top-right box by pressuring their flank, force head-on when our apple count is equal or higher, and only grow when it locks them in. If we die this turn, remember how we got boxed and be more conservative earlier next game \u2014 don't let that seam form between our body and the wall.\n\nI know you want guts and action \u2014 let's try to create disruption and hope RNG or opponent movement gives us a chance.\n\nRIGHT",

Board is **10x10**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude35 Is the enemy actually 100% dead?\n\nCheck all four moves from enemy head **(7,8)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,9)**: our body \u2192 instant death \u2620\ufe0f  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**: their own body \u2192 death \u2620\ufe0f  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**: their own body \u2192 death \u2620\ufe0f  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)**: our body \u2192 death \u2620\ufe0f  \n\nNone of those are tails, none will be vacated this turn, so there is **no escape hatch**. No matter what they pick, they slam into a body segment.\n\nSo as long as **we** don\u2019t grief ourselves, enemy **dies this turn** and we win as sole survivor. EZ clap.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Our legal moves\n\nFrom our head **(8,4)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,5)**: straight into our own neck \u2192 illegal / suicide \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,3)**: empty \u2192 safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,4)**: empty \u2192 safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)**: empty \u2192 safe \u2705  \n\nNo chance of head-on: enemy can only move to (7,9),(7,7),(6,8),(8,8), and we\u2019re not going to any of those.\n\nSo **safe options**: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd14 Which safe move is *best*?\n\nThe game ends this turn as soon as enemy dies and we live, but if it somehow continued, we\u2019d still care about position and apple access:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,4)**: drifts a bit toward center. No immediate apple.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)**: hugs right side, still fine. No immediate apple.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,3)**:\n  - Keeps us away from any walls.\n  - Puts us closer to future apples like **(8,2), (8,1), (9,3), (9,1)**.\n  - Maintains lots of open space below for future pathing.\n\nAll three win, but **DOWN** gives the best future flexibility and aligns with the lower-apple cluster if the game somehow didn\u2019t end.\n\nSo why risk style points when we can secure the dub *and* keep max options? We slide **DOWN** \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Mini-plan for future self (if the game somehow continues)\n\n- Prioritize the lower-right apple cluster: (8,2), (8,1), (9,3), (9,1).  \n- Keep the long body stretched horizontally on rows 3\u20135 to dominate central lanes.  \n- With the enemy gone, shift from \u201cboxing\u201d to safe, efficient farm toward 30 apples while avoiding self-traps near the right wall.\n\nDOWN",
