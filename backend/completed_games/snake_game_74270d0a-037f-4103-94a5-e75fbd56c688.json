Yes, no collision with board edge or enemy\n   - Reasonable? Yes, moves toward middle of board\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (3, 1)\n   - Safe? Yes, no collision\n   - Reasonable? Yes, moves downward\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (2, 2)\n   - Safe? Yes, no collision\n   - Reasonable? Yes, moves leftward\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (4, 2)\n   - Safe? Yes, no collision\n   - Reasonable? Yes, moves rightward toward apple at (4, 4)\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nSince both snakes start with length 1 (just heads), there are no body segments to worry about yet. The key is to position myself to collect apples efficiently while avoiding head-on collisions with the enemy.\n\nApple locations relative to my position (3, 2):\n- (1, 9): Far away, upper-left\n- (5, 6): Medium distance, upper-right\n- (9, 0): Far away, lower-right\n- (8, 2): Medium distance, right (but enemy is at (8, 4))\n- (4, 4): Closest accessible apple, 2 cells diagonal up-right\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is very close and reachable. Moving RIGHT gets me to (4, 2), and then UP would reach (4, 4). This seems like a good short-term target.\n\nThe enemy at (8, 4) is far enough away that we won't collide immediately, but I should be mindful of it.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (4, 4) first since it's closest. Then reassess based on which other apples are most accessible and where the enemy is positioned. Maintain central positioning to keep options open.\n\nUP\n<",

Moving UP to (5, 9) gets me closer (4 away), then I can pivot LEFT.\n\nUP moves me to the top row, which keeps options open and positions me well for pursuing (1, 9).

The cluster at (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2) forms a vertical line that might be easier to chain through.\n\nUP",

Moving UP gives us the fastest route to the apple at (8,9) while preserving future mobility.\n\n**Short‑term plan:**  \n1. Move **UP** to (7,9).  \n2.
