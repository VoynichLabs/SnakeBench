The nearest apples are at (8, 9) and (4,9). \n\n- The apple at (8, 9): Our current position's x is 9, y is 7. Moving UP would go to (9,8), then (9,9), then (8,9). That seems straightforward.\n- Moving UP once from (9,7) to (9,8) is safe; then another move UP to (9,9) is safe. Then moving LEFT to (8,9) will get us an apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving directly LEFT from (9,7) goes to (8,7), which is not an apple, but would take us near to apples at (8,9). Moving LEFT is risky if we stay there too long, but since we only need to reach the apple at (8,9), going UP first makes sense.\n\nAlso, moving UP has no immediate obstacles and keeps us moving toward the apple above. Moving LEFT in one turn takes us directly to the apple at (8,9), but it's farther away to get there in a single move unless we go UP first.\n\nGiven the positions, moving UP once is a safe move that positions us nicely to then go LEFT to grab the apple at (8,9).\n\nNext, consider the enemy snake at (1,8)\u2014it's far from us, so no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, I decide to move UP first, then plan to go LEFT next turn to reach the apple at (8,9).\n\n**Next move: UP**",
