Possible moves:\n1. **UP**: (5,9) \u2192 (5,10) \u2192 **Out of bounds (y=10 is invalid)** \u2192 **Fatal**\n2. **DOWN**: (5,9) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 Valid (within bounds)\n3. **LEFT**: (5,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 Valid\n4. **RIGHT**: (5,9) \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 Valid\n\n**Eliminated moves:** UP (fatal)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Check for Self-Collision or Backwards Move**\n- Snake body: None (length = 1), so no self-collision risk.\n- Backwards move: The snake cannot move backwards because it has no body segments to collide with itself. So no restriction here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Check for Enemy Collision**\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) head is at (0,4). It will move this turn, but we don\u2019t know its direction yet. However, since the enemy is far away (distance from (5,9) to (0,4) is ~7.8 units), there\u2019s no immediate collision risk in the next move unless the enemy moves toward us.\n\n**No immediate enemy collision risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**\n#### **Option 1: DOWN (5,9) \u2192 (5,8)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward the center of the board, increasing flexibility for future moves.\n  - Doesn\u2019t immediately block any potential paths to apples.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn\u2019t directly lead to an apple (closest apple is (6,5), which is not in this direction).\n\n#### **Option 2: LEFT (5,9) \u2192 (4,9)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves left, which could eventually lead toward apples like (3,2) or (2,7).\n  - Keeps the snake near the top edge, which might be useful for avoiding enemies.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn\u2019t directly lead to an apple.\n\n#### **Option 3: RIGHT (5,9) \u2192 (6,9)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward the apple at (6,5) (though not directly toward it).\n  - Could eventually reach the apple at (6,5) if we keep moving right and down.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Less flexible than moving down or left, as it commits to the right edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Prioritize Apple Accessibility**\nThe closest apple to (5,9) is (6,5), which is 1 unit right and 4 units down. The most direct path would involve moving right first to (6,9), then down to (6,8), etc., until reaching (6,5).\n\n**RIGHT** is the best initial move to start moving toward the apple at (6,5).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Avoid Traps or Dead-Ends**\n- Moving **DOWN** keeps options open but doesn\u2019t prioritize apple collection.\n- Moving **LEFT** could lead to the apple at (3,2) but is less direct than moving right.\n- Moving **RIGHT** is the most direct path to the apple at (6,5) and doesn\u2019t trap the snake.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self)**\n**Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. **Turn 1:** Move RIGHT to (6,9) to start moving toward (6,5).\n2. **Turn 2:** Move DOWN to (6,8) to get closer to (6,5).\n3. **Turn 3:** Move DOWN to (6,7), then continue down to (6,6) and (6,5) to eat the apple.\n4. After eating the apple, explore other apples like (2,7) or (3,2) while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Getting stuck in corners or tight spaces.\n- Moving directly toward the enemy snake unless it\u2019s moving away.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **RIGHT**, as it starts the snake on a direct path to the closest apple at (6,5) while keeping future options open.\n\n**RIGHT**",

Continuing down is the most direct path to this apple.\n\n**DOWN** is the best move to continue toward the apple at (6,5).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Avoid Traps or Dead-Ends**\n- Moving **DOWN** keeps the snake on a direct path to the closest apple.\n- Moving **UP** reverses the previous move but doesn\u2019t lead to an apple.\n- Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** doesn\u2019t directly lead to an apple and is less efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Long-Term Strategy Note (Future Self)**\n**Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. **Turn 2:** Move DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to (6,5).\n2. **Turn 3:** Move DOWN to (6,6) to continue toward (6,5).\n3. **Turn 4:** Move DOWN to (6,5) to eat the apple.\n4. After eating the apple, explore other apples like (2,7) or (3,2) while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Getting trapped in tight spaces.\n- Moving directly toward the enemy snake unless it\u2019s moving away.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **DOWN** to continue the direct path to the closest apple at (6,5).\n\n**DOWN**",

No immediate collision risk unless the enemy moves toward us.\n\n**No immediate enemy collision risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**\n\n#### **Option 1: DOWN (6,5) \u2192 (6,4)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves away from the enemy snake's current position.\n  - Could lead toward the apple at (3,2) or (2,1) in future turns.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\n#### **Option 2: LEFT (6,5) \u2192 (5,5)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves away from the enemy snake's current position.\n  - Could lead toward the apple at (3,2) or (2,7) in future turns.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\n#### **Option 3: RIGHT (6,5) \u2192 (7,5)**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves away from the enemy snake's current position.\n  - Could lead toward the apple at (8,4) in future turns.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Prioritize Apple Accessibility**\nNo apples are immediately adjacent to (6,5). However, we need to plan for future turns to reach apples efficiently.\n\n#### **Long-Term Strategy:**\n- **Option 1: DOWN to (6,4)**\n  - From (6,4), we can move LEFT to (5,4) or RIGHT to (7,4) to explore further.\n  - This path could lead toward the apple at (3,2) or (2,1) in future turns.\n\n- **Option 2: LEFT to (5,5)**\n  - From (5,5), we can move UP to (5,6) or DOWN to (5,4).\n  - This path could lead toward the apple at (3,2) or (2,7) in future turns.\n\n- **Option 3: RIGHT to (7,5)**\n  - From (7,5), we can move UP to (7,6) or DOWN to (7,4).\n  - This path could lead toward the apple at (8,4) in future turns.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT to (5,5)** is the most flexible option, as it allows us to reach both (3,2) and (2,7) apples in future turns without getting trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Avoid Traps or Dead-Ends**\n- Moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** could lead to dead-ends or limit our flexibility.\n- Moving **LEFT** allows us to explore more of the board and reach multiple apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe best move is **LEFT** to (5,5) to maximize flexibility and reach future apples.\n\n**LEFT**",

Prioritize growth and positioning to control the upper-left quadrant of the board.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Apples Remaining:** (3,2), (8,4), (7,7) are still available. The closest to our current head at (3,7) is (2,7) and (3,2).\n2. **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (2,7), body at [(1,7), (1,6)]. It is likely to move toward (2,8), (3,7), or (2,6) next. We must avoid paths that lead into their future movement.\n3. **Our Snake:** Length 2 (head at (3,7), body at [(3,6)]). We need to grow to dominate the board and block Snake #0\u2019s access to (2,7).\n\n**Short-Term Plan (Next 3 Turns):**\n- **Turn 10:** Move **LEFT** to (2,7) to collect the apple there, growing our snake.\n- **Turn 11:** From (2,7), move **UP** to (2,8) to secure the upper-left corner and block Snake #0\u2019s movement.\n- **Turn 12:** From (2,8), move **LEFT** to (1,8) to expand our control over the upper-left quadrant.\n\n**Rationale for Turn 10:**\n- **UP (3,7) \u2192 (2,7):** Safe, allows us to collect the apple at (2,7) and grow our snake to length 3.\n- **DOWN (3,7) \u2192 (3,6):** Safe but doesn\u2019t improve apple proximity as effectively as LEFT.\n- **LEFT (3,7) \u2192 (2,7):** Safe, allows us to collect the apple at (2,7) and grow our snake to length 3.\n- **RIGHT (3,7) \u2192 (3,8):** Safe but doesn\u2019t improve apple proximity as effectively as LEFT.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n**LEFT**",
