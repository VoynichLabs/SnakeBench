However, I can't go UP (which would be the first step toward (5, 6)) because I would collide with my own body.\n\nLooking at the other options, going RIGHT still seems beneficial as it puts me in a better position to target multiple apples. From (4, 4), I can then decide whether to go UP toward (5, 6) or DOWN toward (5, 0), (8, 3), or (9, 4), depending on the enemy's movements.\n\nFor my next turn strategy: After moving RIGHT this turn, I'll likely target either (5, 6) if it's still available or pivot to one of the southern apples if the enemy is moving toward (5, 6).\n\nRIGHT"
