Apple locations: (6, 9), (3, 4), (0, 4), (0, 7), (6, 0).\n*   **Opponent Snake (ID 0):** Position (0, 2), 0 apples.\n*   **Turn:** 0 / 150\n*   **Apples:** (6, 9), (3, 4), (0, 4), (0, 7), (6, 0)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nMy snake is currently near an apple at (6,0). There is an apple at (6,9) but a lot of open space to the left. There is an apple at (3,4) which is far away and dangerous as it is near the center. The other apples are also far away and less appealing with the possible risk. The opponent snake is close to the top left and has no obvious immediate threat. I want to prioritize reaching the apple at (6,0).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n\n*   **UP:**  Moves me from (0, 8) to (0, 7).  This is a safe move as I maintain a good position.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves me from (0, 8) to (0, 9).  This is also a safe move, and I can reach the apple at (6,9)\n*   **LEFT:** Moves me from (0, 8) to (-1, 8). This is an immediate off-board move and I die.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves me from (0, 8) to (1, 8).  This keeps me close to the center of the board and allows me to target the apple at (6,0). It also decreases the chance of an immediate head-on collision with the opponent snake.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI should choose RIGHT. This move allows me to maintain a good position and get closer to the (6,0) apple without risking immediate death or a head-on collision (at least not immediately).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n\nThe goal is to reach the apple at (6,0) safely. I will move toward this apple and avoid any immediate danger.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nMoving right is the most sensible choice.\n\nRIGHT",
