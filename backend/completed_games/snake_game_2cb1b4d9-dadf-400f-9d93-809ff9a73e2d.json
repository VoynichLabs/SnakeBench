To get there, I need to go:\n- LEFT (from x=5 to x=3): 2 moves\n- UP (from y=5 to y=8): 3 moves\n\nThe next closest apple is (9, 3) at distance 6.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP gets me closer to the apple at (3, 8) and keeps me in the middle of the board, maintaining flexibility. UP takes me toward (3, 8) by increasing y from 5 to 6, and I can then continue up or move left as needed.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (3, 8) first since it's closest. After that, work on the apple at (3, 0) in the bottom-left. Keep the enemy in mind but since both snakes start with just heads, we have time before collision becomes likely. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nUP",

It moves me closer to the closest apple (3, 8)\n2. It increases y-coordinate toward the apple\n3. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n4. The enemy at (6, 7) will move away or in a different direction\n\n**Long-term strategy for next few turns:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (3, 8) first (closest target). After that, pivot toward either (3, 0) in the bottom-left or (9, 3) depending on positioning. Avoid corners. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position and don't let it cut off my path to apples.\n\nUP",
