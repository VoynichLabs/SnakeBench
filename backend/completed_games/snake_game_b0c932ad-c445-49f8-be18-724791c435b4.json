Snake #0 is at (2, 7) with a head at (2, 9) and body at (3, 9) and an apple at (1, 7).  The apple at (2, 4) is a potential target. The apple at (5,5) and (4, 1) are also close and reachable.\n\nMy immediate concern is snake #0.  His head is directly above my tail, meaning if I move in a way that brings my head closest to (2,7) then my tail will occupy the same position. So, I need to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nMoving left (to (3, 8) then (2, 8)) would put me closer to the apple at (2,4), and would keep me farther away from snake #0. Also, this would remove me from the area around snake #0's head. Continuing to move in this direction would keep further away from snake #0.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that snake #0 isn't stationary. He will be moving, and I should anticipate his movements.\n\nGiven that, moving left is the best option to minimize the risk of a collision and increase the chances of collecting the apple at (2, 4). It also helps to maintain a safer distance from Snake #0.  While the apple at (5,5) is closer, the apple at (2,4) is more easily reachable, and it prevents a potential collision. I need to be mindful of snake 0's likely direction of movement.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",
