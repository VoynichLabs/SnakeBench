No walls, no snakes, no my-body collision risk.\n- Enemy is far away and poses no immediate danger.\n\nThus, no immediate threats, perfect safety, and moves me closer to my next apple target.\n\nStrategy for future turns:\n- Next turns I should plan to move DOWN after moving LEFT.

Both paths eventually reach apple similarly easily.\n\nEither direction is generally good. The board currently gives no threats either way. DOWN seems slightly simpler since it maintains some flexibility and sets a clear path toward the apple relatively directly without delay.\n\nFinal decision and quick strategic reminder:\n- I'll proceed DOWN to clearly align vertically and horizontally with the apple at (7,5).\n- Next move, aim carefully toward apple at (7,5).\n\nFinal decision:\nDOWN"

It positions me best for the next apple collection.\n- LEFT (6,5) is also safe, but provides slightly less direct route toward apple at (7,2).\n\nConclusion:\nDOWN is the clear optimal and safe decision\u2014moves directly towards closest apple at (7,2) while maintaining immediate safety.\n\nReminder to self next turn:\nAfter moving DOWN, check carefully again for immediate surroundings and keep moving carefully toward the nearest apples (e.g. (7,2)) to maximize points safely.\n\nFinal decision:\nDOWN"

Occupied by my own body\u2014unsafe.\n- DOWN: moves out of the board at (7,-1). Clearly unsafe.\n\nThus, my safe move choices are either UP or RIGHT.\n\nThinking strategically:\n- Moving UP would begin to clear away from the crowded bottom edge. However, (7,2) and above are blocked heavily by my own body, so I have limited immediate upward movement after (7,1). Still, (7,1) is currently a free safe cell.\n- Moving RIGHT (8,0) also seems safe immediately. After moving RIGHT, from (8,0), I would still have potential to maneuver upwards or further right next turn. This gives more breathing room and allows me to consider pursuing the apples on the far right side (9,6) and (9,9) more effectively.\n\nGiven that RIGHT offers potentially greater freedom and a clearer longer-term route, I shall choose to move RIGHT.\n\nNext turn strategy reminder:\nContinue carefully assessing safe cells and aim upwards toward the apples higher on the right side (such as at positions (9,6) or ultimately (9,9)).

            "rationale": "Thinking out loud, let's carefully reassess our current situation to decide the next move:\n\nCurrent position and surroundings:\n- My snake's head position is now at (8, 1).\n- The snake body occupies the following positions: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\n- Apples remain at positions: (9,9), (1,7), (9,6), (4,6), (9,4)\n\nPossible moves assessment (from head position (8,1)):\n- UP (to 8,2): Checks the board state, (8,2) is empty and safe to move into. This move continues our upward strategy, moving closer to the apples located vertically above.\n- RIGHT (to 9,1): Also seems to be safe from the board information provided. It might position us closer to the apples along the right edge. However, maintaining upward movement may provide an efficient vertical path to multiple apples.\n- LEFT (to 7,1): This space appears safe as per the provided map. However, moving left brings us closer to our body's position at (7,2), potentially cornering ourselves, thus less favorable.\n- DOWN (to 8,0): This tile is occupied by our snake (body segment located here), thus unsafe and immediately eliminated as an option.\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- Our primary objective remains the apples clustered at positions (9,4), (9,6), and (9,9).\n- Continuing UPward aligns perfectly with our previously established plan, offering the most straightforward and safe vertical path toward multiple apples.\n- RIGHT could be considered as a secondary strategic option, but it moves horizontally too early, potentially complicating our route and limiting maneuverability.\n\nConclusion:\nThe best immediate and strategic move here continues to be UP. It maintains safety, aligns to our strategic approach, and helps us clearly move towards the apples awaiting pickup.\n\nStrategy Reminder for the next turn:\n- Keep a close observation on enemy snake movements.\n- Maintain vertical progression towards apples, primarily aiming at the ones along the right-hand side (particularly at (9,4), (9,6), and (9,9)), consuming them efficiently while avoiding traps or collisions.\n\nFinal decision: UP"

Continuing in the upward direction (UP) positions our snake perfectly to approach these apples efficiently.\n- RIGHT could be considered but doesn't directly bring us closer to apples vertically; UP is clearly superior at the moment.\n- Continue to keep safe, avoid collisions with our own snake body, other snakes, and walls.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe best immediate strategic move remains UP, bringing the snake closer to key apples (9,4; 9,6; 9,9), while staying safe and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nStrategy Reminder for next turn:  \n- Maintain clear upward/rightward direction to efficiently consume apples.  \n- Remain vigilant regarding changes in enemy snake positions to avoid being caught in a difficult spot or collision scenario.\n\nFinal decision: UP"

Continuing in the upward direction (UP) positions our snake perfectly to approach these apples efficiently.\n- RIGHT could be considered but doesn't directly bring us closer to apples vertically; UP is clearly superior at the moment.\n- Continue to keep safe, avoid collisions with our own snake body, other snakes, and walls.\n\nConclusion:  \nThe best immediate strategic move remains UP, bringing the snake closer to key apples (9,4; 9,6; 9,9), while staying safe and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nStrategy Reminder for next turn:  \n- Maintain clear upward/rightward direction to efficiently consume apples.  \n- Remain vigilant regarding changes in enemy snake positions to avoid being caught in a difficult spot or collision scenario.\n\nFinal decision: UP"

However, moving left brings us closer to our body's position at (7,2), potentially cornering ourselves, thus less favorable.\n- DOWN (to 8,0): This tile is occupied by our snake (body segment located here), thus unsafe and immediately eliminated as an option.\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- Our primary objective remains the apples clustered at positions (9,4), (9,6), and (9,9).\n- Continuing UPward aligns perfectly with our previously established plan, offering the most straightforward and safe vertical path toward multiple apples.\n- RIGHT could be considered as a secondary strategic option, but it moves horizontally too early, potentially complicating our route and limiting maneuverability.\n\nConclusion:\nThe best immediate and strategic move here continues to be UP. It maintains safety, aligns to our strategic approach, and helps us clearly move towards the apples awaiting pickup.\n\nStrategy Reminder for the next turn:\n- Keep a close observation on enemy snake movements.\n- Maintain vertical progression towards apples, primarily aiming at the ones along the right-hand side (particularly at (9,4), (9,6), and (9,9)), consuming them efficiently while avoiding traps or collisions.\n\nFinal decision: UP"

I cannot move there directly!\n- If I move LEFT: I move to (7, 9), which is clear and safe, and from there I have a clear route DOWN toward the apple at (7,5).\n\nThus, moving LEFT seems very logical, as it's an open space:\n- The cell (7,9) is not occupied and is safe. \n- It also positions me better towards apples (7,5) and (7,2).\n\nCheck possible dangers:\n- Moving LEFT to (7,9) is safe. No walls, no snakes, no my-body collision risk.\n- Enemy is far away and poses no immediate danger.\n\nThus, no immediate threats, perfect safety, and moves me closer to my next apple target.\n\nStrategy for future turns:\n- Next turns I should plan to move DOWN after moving LEFT. I still must make sure to avoid my own body as it might still be occupying (7,8), (7,7), etc. Initially, after LEFT at (7,9), next logical step likely DOWN again, intending to reach apple at (7,5).\n\nFinal decision for this turn:\nLEFT"

However, (7,2) and above are blocked heavily by my own body, so I have limited immediate upward movement after (7,1). Still, (7,1) is currently a free safe cell.\n- Moving RIGHT (8,0) also seems safe immediately. After moving RIGHT, from (8,0), I would still have potential to maneuver upwards or further right next turn. This gives more breathing room and allows me to consider pursuing the apples on the far right side (9,6) and (9,9) more effectively.\n\nGiven that RIGHT offers potentially greater freedom and a clearer longer-term route, I shall choose to move RIGHT.\n\nNext turn strategy reminder:\nContinue carefully assessing safe cells and aim upwards toward the apples higher on the right side (such as at positions (9,6) or ultimately (9,9)). Keep track of body's trailing segments clearing away space if necessary.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT"
