If I go to the right, that would take me towards the apple, but their snake is just as well-positioned. If I go to the left, I might be able to flank them and grab the same square that they could try to defend. That could be advantageous so that they can't stop me from eating the nearby apple. \n\nAlternatively, moving straight up would leave their head exposed, covering their area and reducing their choices. Furthermore, if I move towards them, I'm closer to that apple, but I've learned that the snake always has priority over them and if you go away from their line, they might get to the apple first. I'll instead try to anticipate their next move and move as if the e_snake will simply stay 2 spaces ahead of me to cover the apple. \n\nBy going to the left, I move into their north position, then moving forward will cut off the e_snake from going south. This successfully isolates them in a 3x3 space above the e_snake. With the e_snake being one move closer to this SE area, they can take 9 actions before the apple is gone. I will decide to eat the apple right from the get-go with the e_having no response except to enter the same cell, so pushing them out with force. I will do the following:\n\nDOWN\n</uplicate_with_unchanged_ending>\n```Step 1: Find nearest unprotected apple*s by calculating possible prey\nThere are currently four apples available on the board: \n- A at coordinates(1, 3) is elsewhere.\n- A at coordinates(3, 6)is elsewhere. \n- A at coordinates(8, 9)is still too far and no threat currently.\n\nStep 2: Calculate threats from enemy snakes\nSnakeID0is at(7,1). The enemy head is at(8,7). At a glace, the distance from snakeID0to the enemy is5spaces:\n7-8=-1 in the x-direction and1-7 =-6 in the y-direction. The Manhattan distance between them is |-1|+|-6|=7. In one move, I can change the snakeID0to(6,1), bringing the distance to6spaces, and the snakeID0still equal to 1 space behind on step1 of snake.  \n\nStep3: Determine which direction to move with respect to all possible scenarios\n\nBecause the last prediction for the enemy is that they will not act, this means that snakeID0can wait until turn10, where snake1 will have grown and be pushed against the walls. Provided that the enemy will not initiat\u00faa an attack, then the optimal route is to pursue the enemy from its starting position in the northEast quadrant (8,7). This has the advantage that at turn10, it will be easy to predict what snakeID0will be doing in future turns. However, it will require the snake to go further around to the east to avoid merging with the enemy head:\n\nRule #2 you should try not hit snake so if the enemy had Full control of the e_snake then, if you try to eat its head you would be adversely impacted. So, I preferI try to go towards it snakeID0because you want to eat as many as quickly and snakeID0towards the enemy in the SE. It's likely that it will end on the square behind the apple at (8,9) it so that direction won't work out.\n\nSnaking towards the otherENpatibility\u767c\u63ee, it is wide open, and the apple to the west is far away. To the north is(7,7), but also to the south has a safe space and apples to the south. This has the benefit of placing the enemy's entire body at reasonable distance in their own snake body.\n\nTherefore the last step is the correct choice, the optimal path towards the EN range and apple is towards the e_snake, since the enemy position more towards the E axis than the west axis of actions. The last\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 move of the enemy is towards the north\u53d1\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b, so their next shouldn't go further down into the west axis.\n\nTherefore I choose the last move be DOWN\n```",
