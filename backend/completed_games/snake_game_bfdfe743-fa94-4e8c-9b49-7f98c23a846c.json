Opponent is chilling at (0,2) so we can take a clean apple up top without drama.\n\nChosen immediate safe move: Up to (6,9) to grab the apple and grow. This puts us on the top edge with a safe escape route afterward.\n\nPLAN:\n- Short-term: Move Up to (6,9), eat the apple, grow to length 2. Stay away from the enemy\u2019s potential paths; keep the top row as a buffer.\n- Mid-term: After growing, keep two safe follow-ups (left to (5,9) or right to (7,9)) to avoid dead-ends. Don\u2019t loop back into your own neck yet.\n- Long-term: Use the open top-right-ish space to pressure the board center/left area and guide the opponent toward the edge. If a clean head-on isn\u2019t forced, prioritize survival and apple-gain while maintaining escape options.\n\nRationale (short): The immediate Up move is the safest apple gain given the opponent\u2019s distant position. It also creates a small body, which you can maneuver to dodge and force the longer-term box-in without risking a trap on turn 0. Stay aggressive but calculated; don\u2019t chase reckless head-ons when scores are even.\n\nup",

Opponent is chilling at (3,3) with one tail at (2,3). Score margin is in our favor (2 apples to 1). Apple drops are wild, but we\u2019re focusing on the man in front of us and the map shape.\n\nDecision process recap:\n- Evaluate four moves from (7,7): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- UP would run straight into our own neck (7,8) \u2192 death. Not an option.\n- DOWN continues forward, LEFT and RIGHT both safe and toward the center/apple cluster.\n- We want to pressure the center, grab nearby apples, and avoid giving the rival easy head-on lines.\n\nChosen move: LEFT to (6,7). This keeps us advancing toward the apple at (5,7) and toward the map\u2019s center, setting up future containment lines while staying safe from the current opponent\u2019s reach.\n\nWhy LEFT is the play:\n- It makes a beeline for the nearby apple at (5,7) (we can grab it next turn if we keep the flow), growing our lead.\n- It keeps multiple escape routes open (toward (5,7), (6,6), or (6,8) if needed) and doesn\u2019t box us in yet.\n- It inches us toward the central area to potentially corral the opponent into tighter corridors later.\n- We stay mindful of not trading a head-on collision unless it benefits the score; with the current apples advantage, forcing a decisive clash later could seal the round.\n\nLong-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Grow by safely snatching the apple near (5,7) and then pivot to a corridor-control approach, slowly squeezing space toward the center.\n- Use the center area to threaten head-on opportunities if the enemy pokes toward us; if we detect an opening for a head-on collision with higher apple count, commit to it to win on tie-breakers.\n- Maintain at least two safe exits from our head at each turn to avoid trapping ourselves in tight corners.\n- Keep the enemy\u2019s path predictable by steering into lines that push him toward edges or single-file corridors, while we stay flexible.\n\nFinal move choice (executed next turn): LEFT\n\nLEFT",

All three are free of walls and enemy bodies. \ud83d\udd25\n\nDecision: DOWN to (4,2). Why DOWN is the pick:\n- It\u2019s a safe move that doesn\u2019t crash into anything.\n- It keeps us centered and opens multiple safe follow-ups: from (4,2) we can jab toward (4,1) to grab potential apples, or swing to (3,2) or (5,2) to pressure the left/right lanes.\n- It nudges us toward the bottom-left quadrant where the enemy is weaker, while maintaining two strong escape routes.\n\nImmediate risk check:\n- We\u2019re not stepping into the opponent\u2019s body, and we\u2019re not colliding with our own.\n- A head-on now isn\u2019t forced, but we\u2019ve kept lines open to force advantageous exchanges later.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- From (4,2), threaten a cross-pocket: aim for (4,1) (apple or safe growth) while keeping (3,2) and (5,2) as backups. This lets you control the immediate corridor around the enemy\u2019s lower-left zone.\n- If the opponent hard-commits toward our side, look for a controlled head-on only if we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples; otherwise keep the box-friendly approach and dodge into safe lanes.\n\nLong-term strategy notes:\n- Always keep at least two safe exits from every pivot to prevent fatal traps.\n- Use central control to constrict the opponent\u2019s options and lure mistakes.\n- Prioritize safe growth when it doesn\u2019t compromise your box; avoid reckless expansions that create kinks or dead-ends.\n- If a clean head-on becomes favorable (we\u2019re up in apples), initiate it to wipe the rival off the board; if not, grind toward a win by consistency and positioning.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT is illegal (hits your own neck at (4,1)); LEFT would slam into the opponent\u2019s tail at (2,1) (not safe).\n- CURRENT READ: You\u2019re ahead on apples but not yet boxed in. We keep space now to threaten a left-side wedge on future turns while maintaining multiple escape routes.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next 4-6 turns):\n- Thread upward toward the left corridor (toward x=2) so we can stitch a wall along the second column. This sets up a cross-lock opportunity around turns 16-20.\n- If the opponent dips into the open left border, we punish with a controlled squeeze, forcing a potential head-on or trap while keeping two exits open.\n- Stay mindful of apples to avoid giving him a clean growth edge; use growth as leverage when it helps widen the trap, not to race ahead on a bare chase.\n\nEMOTIONAL PULSE: we\u2019re stacking pressure, eyeing the box, and staying two steps ahead. The move keeps us safe, flexible, and ready to crash the box.\n\nMOVE DECISION: UP\n\nUP",

DOWN is a death dive into our own neck, so we eliminate it.\n\nRationale: UP keeps the central corridors open, avoids immediate contact with his body, and sets up future squeezes without boxed-in risk. LEFT could push us toward a flank trap but may invite him to swing around into (2,7)/(3,7) lines. RIGHT expands toward the right apples but could invite him to sweep and pin us along our own waxy turn. We\u2019re playing the long game: multi-exit, multi-threat, and a potential head-on if we can pin him when we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nChosen move: UP\n\nUP",
