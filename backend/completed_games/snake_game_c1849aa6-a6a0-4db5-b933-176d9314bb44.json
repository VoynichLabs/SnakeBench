The last move information incorrectly states that our snake's head is at (1, 6) and the body is at [(2, 6)], but according to the initial board state, our snake's head is actually at (2, 3) with a body at [(2, 4), (2, 5)]. The apples and enemy snake positions are also different from what was described in the last move rationale.\n\nWith the correct board state in mind, our current goal is to collect the apple at (1, 3), which is directly to the left of our snake's head. There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake, as it is moving away from our position.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n1. Move towards the apple at (1, 3) since it's the closest and safest to collect.\n2. After collecting the apple at (1, 3), we should aim for the next closest apple that doesn't put us in danger. The apples at (2, 8) and (3, 9) are in close proximity and can be targeted next.\n3. We must continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions.\n4. It's important to keep an escape route open and not get cornered by the enemy snake or our own body.\n5. As we grow in length, we should also consider the entire board to plan future movements and avoid getting trapped as the game progresses.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT to collect the apple at (1, 3).\n\nThis move will increase our length and score, and it sets us up to consider our next move towards the apples at (2, 8) and (3, 9) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.",
