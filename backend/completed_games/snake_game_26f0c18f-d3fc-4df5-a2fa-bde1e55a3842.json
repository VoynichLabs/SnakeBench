My body is at [(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)], so I've grown to 5 segments total.\n\nCurrent situation analysis:\n- Remaining apples are at: (2, 9), (0, 9), (8, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8)\n- Enemy snake (ID: 1) is at (3, 2) with body at [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)] - only 1 space away from me on the same column!\n\nThis is a critical moment. The enemy snake is directly below me at (3, 2), and I'm at (3, 3). I need to get off this column immediately to avoid a potential head-on collision.\n\nLet me evaluate my movement options from (3, 3):\n- UP to (3, 4) - This would hit my own body segment (my neck), so I'd die\n- DOWN to (3, 2) - This would collide with the enemy snake's head, so I'd die\n- LEFT to (2, 3) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n- RIGHT to (4, 3) - Safe move, gets me away from the enemy snake\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe options. Let me consider which is more strategic:\n\nLEFT to (2, 3): This would position me closer to the apples at (1, 6) and (1, 8) on the left side of the board. From (2, 3), I could work my way toward these apples.\n\nRIGHT to (4, 3): This would position me closer to the apple at (8, 3), which is on the same row as my current position. From (4, 3), I could continue right toward that apple.\n\nThe apple at (8, 3) is particularly attractive because it's on the same y-coordinate, meaning I could reach it by moving straight right without changing elevation. This seems like the most efficient path.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (4, 3), continue moving RIGHT toward the apple at (8, 3). This will also keep me away from the enemy snake and give me a clear path to another point.\n\nRIGHT"

(Note: Our previous explanation had an outdated body, so we update accordingly.) Looking at the immediate adjacent cells from our head at (3,2):\n\n\u2022 UP \u2192 (3,3). However, the enemy snake\u2019s head sits at (3,3), so moving UP would result in an immediate collision.  \n\u2022 DOWN \u2192 (3,1) is occupied by our own body.  \n\u2022 LEFT \u2192 (2,2) is free.  \n\u2022 RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) is also free.\n\nNow, considering the apples on the board at (2,9), (0,9), (8,3), (1,6), and (1,8), two catch our attention from our current location:\n\u2022 The apple at (8,3) is 6 Manhattan steps away from (3,2): (8\u20133)=5 and (3\u20132)=1.  \n\u2022 The apple at (1,6) is also 6 Manhattan steps away: (3\u20131)=2 and (6\u20132)=4.\n\nBecause the enemy snake is near our UP direction, we want to avoid that part of the board. Heading RIGHT to (4,2) moves us toward the apple at (8,3) without drawing us into the enemy\u2019s proximity. From (4,2) we can later navigate upward and right to safely reach (8,3).\n\nThus, to avoid collisions and work toward a tasty apple, our chosen move is RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

My strategy of moving toward the apple cluster on the left side is working perfectly.

UP to (4, 7): This would take me off my efficient path to (1, 6) but could position me for the upper apple cluster later.\n3.

This is an excellent opportunity: moving UP collects the apple, grows our snake, and gives us a point. The cell is safe since only an apple occupies it.\n\n\u2022 LEFT leads to (1,8), which is already occupied by part of the enemy snake\u2019s body. That would be fatal.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT goes to (3,8), which is part of our own body. That move is not possible.\n\n\u2022 DOWN would take us to (2,7).

This snake could potentially move UP to (2, 9) to try to get the apple, but I should be able to reach it first if I move RIGHT now and then RIGHT again next turn.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 9), I'll be perfectly positioned to collect the apple at (2, 9) on my next turn, assuming the enemy doesn't get there first. But given the enemy's current position and body configuration, I should have priority.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move RIGHT again to (2, 9) to collect the apple, then assess the remaining apples at (9, 1), (1, 1), (4, 1), and (6, 7). The bottom row apples might be easier to access safely.\n\nRIGHT"
