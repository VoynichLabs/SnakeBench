Enemy head = (6,9). No bodies yet, so no immediate self-collisions.\n- Moves from (0,6): UP -> (0,7) safe; DOWN -> (0,5) safe; RIGHT -> (1,6) safe; LEFT -> (\u22121,6) is OFF BOARD = instant death. Do not do that. \ud83d\ude2c\n- No immediate head-on threat \u2014 opponent is far up at y=9. They could start moving left/down, but they can't reach me this turn.\n- Among UP/DOWN/RIGHT, I prefer the move that preserves the most future options and doesn't shove me into the left wall pocket. RIGHT gives me 4 follow-up directions next turn (back, up, down, forward) while UP or DOWN along the left edge only give 3 (left is blocked). More options = more control and less chance to get boxed. \u2705\n- Also RIGHT moves me toward the center and puts me in range to contest the nearby apple at (1,5) next turn if we want to grow and pressure. Aggressive play = good. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc4a\n\nRisk check:\n- Moving RIGHT doesn't place me into any enemy cell this turn. No body collisions. Safe move.\n- We shouldn't force a head-on; scores are tied 0\u20130. We'll only risk a mutual collision once we have an advantage. For now, take space and options.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (this will be our NEXT RATIONALE):\n- Secure nearby space toward center: push to (1,6) now, then either go down to grab apple at (1,5) or pivot toward center/top depending on opponent's approach.\n- Avoid hugging the left wall; keep multiple escape routes open.\n- If enemy funnels toward center, bait them into committing and then use our body after growing to block their escape or force a head-on when we lead in apples.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 time to take the board.

          "move": "DOWN",
          "rationale": "I'm here to play Snake live! Let's break down the board and figure out the best move.\n\n**Analysis of the Situation:**\n- My snake (ID 1) is at (6, 9) with 0 apples. The opponent (Snake #0) is at (0, 6) also with 0 apples. It's turn 0, so no history yet.\n- The board is 10x10 with many apples scattered around. I need to dominate the board and box out the opponent.\n- Key apples near me: (6, 1) is far down, (6, 4) is down, (8, 4) is to the right and down, (1, 5) is far, (5, 1) far, (3, 4) far, (2, 9) is close to my top row? Actually, I'm at y=9, x=6, so (2,9) is left on the same row. That's a reachable apple if I go left.\n- Opponent is at (0,6). They might move towards apples like (1,5) or (0,1) or (4,0) etc. I need to avoid head-on collisions and force them into traps.\n\n**Move Elimination (Safety Check):**\n- From (6,9), possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- UP: (6,10) \u2013 that's off the board (y max is 9). DEAD. Eliminate.\n- DOWN: (6,8) \u2013 valid coordinate. Check if it's occupied: Board shows at y=8, x=6 is '.' (empty). No snake bodies there. Safe from immediate death. But is it safe from opponent? Opponent is far away.\n- LEFT: (5,9) \u2013 valid. Board shows at y=9, x=5 is '.'? Actually, row 9: \"9 . . A . . A 1 . . .\" So positions: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 'A', x=3 '.', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 '1' (me), x=7 '.', x=8 '.', x=9 '.'. So (5,9) is empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) \u2013 valid. Board shows at y=9, x=7 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nSo all moves except UP are safe immediately. UP is out of bounds.\n\n**Now, consider strategy:**\n- I want to grow and box in the opponent. My opponent is at (0,6), bottom-left area. I'm top-right area. To dominate, I should move towards the center or control key areas.\n- Apples: (2,9) is left on the same row. If I go LEFT to (5,9), I'm closer to (2,9). But (2,9) is apple, so eventually I can eat it. However, going LEFT now might not get the apple immediately because I need to move multiple steps.\n- Other apples: (6,1) is directly below, but that's 8 steps down. (6,4) is down 5 steps. (8,4) is right and down. (4,6) is left and down, but opponent is near (0,6).\n- Since opponent is at (0,6), I should avoid going towards them too early to prevent head-on collision. But if I have higher score later, I can force collision. Currently scores are tied 0-0, so avoid collision.\n- I need to keep options open. Moving DOWN to (6,8) gives me access to many apples below: (6,4), (6,1), etc. It also moves me towards the center vertically. But (6,8) is empty, so no immediate apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,9) gets me closer to (2,9) apple, but that apple is on the top row. From (5,9), I could go left to (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) to eat it. However, (2,9) is an apple, so if I eat it, I grow. But after eating, my tail grows, and I need to plan moves to avoid trapping myself.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,9) gives access to apples like (8,4) and (8,6), but they are farther down. (8,6) is apple at y=6, x=8. From (7,9), I'd need to go down and right.\n- Which move has the most safe follow-up moves? Let's think about future paths.\n  - DOWN to (6,8): From there, I can go DOWN to (6,7), (6,6), etc. to reach (6,4) and (6,1). Also, I can go LEFT or RIGHT to access other apples. The board is open in the middle. This seems good for long-term control.\n  - LEFT to (5,9): From there, I can go LEFT to (4,9), (3,9), (2,9) to eat apple. But after eating at (2,9), my body will extend, and I might block my own path. Also, (2,9) is near the left edge, which might limit future moves. The opponent is at (0,6), so if I go too left, I might get closer to them.\n  - RIGHT to (7,9): From there, I can go RIGHT to (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8), etc. to reach (8,6) and (8,4). But (8,9) is empty, and (8,8) is empty? Board row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . . .\" so all empty. That's open space. However, (8,6) is apple, and (8,4) is apple. This path might be longer.\n- Considering opponent's potential moves: They are at (0,6). They might move RIGHT to (1,6) or UP to (0,7) or DOWN to (0,5) or LEFT out of bounds (can't). They have apples at (1,5), (0,1), (4,0), etc. They might go towards (1,5) which is close. I should avoid moving directly towards them. My current moves are all away from them since I'm at top-right and they at bottom-left.\n- Safety from head-on: If I move DOWN to (6,8), opponent might move RIGHT to (1,6) or something. No direct conflict.\n- If I move LEFT to (5,9), opponent is far, so no issue.\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,9), same.\n- Among safe moves, which gives me the best chance to eat an apple soon? None of them immediately get an apple, but (2,9) is only 3 steps left from (6,9) via (5,9)->(4,9)->(3,9)->(2,9). Actually, from (6,9) to (2,9) is 4 steps left: (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9). So if I go LEFT now, I can eat (2,9) in 3 more moves? Wait, from (6,9) to (5,9) is one move left, then to (4,9), then to (3,9), then to (2,9). So 4 moves total to eat (2,9). But I might not want to commit to a long path immediately.\n- Alternatively, DOWN to (6,8) puts me closer to (6,4) which is 4 steps down from (6,8)? From (6,8) to (6,4) is 4 steps down: (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So similar distance.\n- (6,1) is even farther: from (6,8) to (6,1) is 7 steps down.\n- (8,4) is from (6,9): if I go RIGHT to (7,9), then DOWN to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4) \u2013 that's 7 moves.\n- (8,6) is from (6,9): RIGHT to (7,9), DOWN to (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), then RIGHT to (8,6) \u2013 5 moves.\n- So (2,9) is the closest apple in terms of steps? Actually, from (6,9) to (2,9) is 4 steps left. From (6,9) to (6,4) is 5 steps down. So (2,9) is slightly closer.\n- But (2,9) is on the edge, while (6,4) is in the center. The center might offer more future options.\n- Also, I need to consider that after eating an apple, I grow, so my tail will extend. If I eat (2,9), my tail might block (3,9) or something, making it harder to move left further. But since I'm on the top row, I might have room to move right or down after eating.\n- If I eat (6,4), I'm in the center, and I can go in many directions.\n- Long-term plan: I want to dominate the board and trap the opponent. The opponent is near the left edge. I should control the center and right side, then move left to cut off their escape. So moving DOWN towards the center seems good.\n- Also, note that the board has many apples. I should collect them to grow faster and eventually force a collision when I'm larger.\n- Decision: I think moving DOWN to (6,8) is the best. It moves me towards the center, keeps options open (I can go left, right, or down from there), and avoids the edge. It also doesn't immediately commit to a path that might trap me.\n- Let's check if (6,8) is safe from opponent's move this turn. Opponent might move RIGHT to (1,6) or UP to (0,7), etc. No conflict.\n- Also, I should avoid moving into a cell that the opponent might move into. Since we move simultaneously, if opponent moves into (6,8) from somewhere, but they are at (0,6), so they can't reach (6,8) in one move. So safe.\n- Therefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n**Plan for future self:** Move down towards the center to access multiple apples and control the board. Avoid left edge until necessary to engage opponent. Grow fast and then force confrontation when I have advantage.DOWN",

Time to set the tone!\n- My head: (6,8) - wait, the board shows me at (6,8) but the description says (6,8) is empty? Let's check the board again...\n  - Board row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . . .\" Actually looking at the board:\n    - Row 9: \"9 . . A . . A 1 . . .\" so I'm at (6,9) on the board, not (6,8)!\n    - Row 8: \"8 . . . . . . . . . .\" all empty\n    - Row 7: \"7 . . . . . . . . . .\" empty\n    - Row 6: \"6 . 0 . . A . . . A .\" - opponent at (1,6)\n- So my head is ACTUALLY at (6,9)! The body is empty. Opponent at (1,6).\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE ANALYSIS:**\nFrom (6,9), possible moves:\n1. **UP** - (6,10) - OFF BOARD! Instant death. \u274c DEAD\n2. **DOWN** - (6,8) - Board shows '.' (empty). Safe from walls and snakes. \u2705\n3. **LEFT** - (5,9) - Board shows '.' (empty). Safe. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT** - (7,9) - Board shows '.' (empty). Safe. \u2705\n\nAll except UP are immediately safe!\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\nWe're at the TOP ROW (y=9)! That's great for avoiding early collision with opponent at (1,6) bottom-left.\n\n**Apples to consider:**\n- (2,9) - LEFT on same row! Only 4 steps away: (5,9)\u2192(4,9)\u2192(3,9)\u2192(2,9)\n- (6,4) - DOWN 5 steps\n- (6,1) - DOWN 8 steps\n- (8,6) - RIGHT+DOWN\n- (8,4) - RIGHT+DOWN further\n\n**Opponent Intel:**\nSnake #0 at (1,6) with 0 apples. They'll likely move toward nearby apples: (1,5) is just DOWN from them, or (0,1) is far, or (4,0) far. They're NOT close to me.\n\n**WHY NOT LEFT TO CHASE (2,9)?**\nIf I go LEFT to (5,9), I'm committing to the top edge. After eating (2,9), I'd be trapped on the left side with limited escape routes. The opponent might cut me off later. Plus, (2,9) is only 1 apple - we need GROWTH for DOMINATION!\n\n**WHY NOT RIGHT?**\nGoing RIGHT to (7,9) heads toward (8,6) and (8,4), but that's longer path. Right edge also limits future movement.\n\n**WHY DOWN IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **CENTRAL CONTROL** - (6,8) puts me in the CENTER of the board. From there I can go ANYWHERE: left, right, down, even back up.\n2. **MULTIPLE APPLE ACCESS** - From center, I can grab (6,4), (6,1), (8,4), (8,6), (5,1), (3,4) - ALL available!\n3. **AVOID EDGE TRAPS** - Staying away from walls gives more maneuvering room to trap opponent later.\n4. **SAFETY FIRST** - (6,8) is confirmed empty. Opponent can't reach it this turn.\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - Next turn from (6,8), I'll have 3-4 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, maybe UP back to top if needed).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN):**\nMove down to (6,8) \u2192 then DOWN to (6,7) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (6,4) to eat first apple! While growing, monitor opponent. Once I'm bigger (2+ segments), I can start boxing them in from the center. Force head-on collision when I have size advantage! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN to (6,8). Safe, flexible, and starts my path to CENTER DOMINATION! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Grabbing the (1,5) apple this turn is high-value and safe.\n- Getting that apple gives us the lead which lets us play more aggressively next turns (we can bait for head-on later).\n- Moving into (1,5) does not create any immediate collisions and increases our control of space.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will appear as our \u201clast rationale\u201d next turn):\n- Take the apple at (1,5) now (DOWN) to get +1 apple and a body segment.\n- Then pivot toward the center (via RIGHT moves) while growing on reachable apples (like (4,6) or (3,4)) to build a body that can cut off escape routes.\n- Avoid mutual head-on until we have a clear apples advantage; once ahead, force collisions or trap the enemy with our body.\n\nTime to grab that apple and start the domination.

Time to catch up!\n- My head: (6,7) - wait, looking at the board state carefully:\n  - Row 7: \"7 . . . . . . 1 . . .\" - that's ME at (6,7)! Perfect.\n  - Body: empty, so no self-collision issues.\n- Opponent Snake #0: Head at (1,5), Body: [(1,6)], Apples: 1\n  - They're in the bottom-left quadrant, far from me.\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (6,7):**\nPossible moves:\n1. **UP** to (6,8): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe from walls and snakes. \u2705\n2. **DOWN** to (6,6): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe. \u2705\n3. **LEFT** to (5,7): Board shows '.' (empty).

No walls, no snakes, no self-collision.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY & OPPONENT INTEL:**\nNearby apples:\n- (6,4) - DOWN 3 steps\n- (6,1) - DOWN 6 steps  \n- (5,1) - DOWN+LEFT\n- (3,4) - LEFT+DOWN\n- (2,2) - LEFT+DOWN\n- (8,4) - RIGHT+DOWN\n- (8,6) - RIGHT+DOWN\n\nOpponent at (1,5) with body at (1,6). They'll likely chase apples in their region: (2,2), (3,4), (4,0), or (0,1). They're NOT close to my position (6,7).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nFrom center-left position (6,7), I want to:\n1. **MAINTAIN CENTRAL CONTROL** - Stay in the middle to access both sides\n2. **CHASE NEAREST APPLE** - (6,4) is straight down, 3 steps away\n3. **KEEP FLEXIBILITY** - Avoid getting boxed against edges\n\n**WHY NOT UP?**\nGoing UP to (6,8) moves me toward the top edge. While safe, it limits my downward mobility and pushes me away from the dense apple cluster at (6,4), (6,1), (5,1). Top row is less valuable early.\n\n**WHY NOT LEFT?**\nLEFT to (5,7) is safe but moves me toward the left edge. While there are apples at (3,4), (2,2), I'd be committing to a side. From center-left (6,7), I have better access to central apples.\n\n**WHY NOT RIGHT?**\nRIGHT to (7,7) moves me toward the right edge with apples at (8,4), (8,6). But that's farther and more edge-trapping. The left side has more dense apples.\n\n**WHY DOWN IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **DIRECT PATH TO APPLE** - (6,4) is straight down, 3 steps. That's my first target!\n2. **CENTRAL POSITIONING** - From (6,6), I can still go left, right, or continue down.\n3. **APPLE DENSITY** - The (6,4)\u2192(6,1)\u2192(5,1) cluster is valuable and central.\n4. **OPPONENT DISTANCE** - Opponent is far away at (1,5), no immediate threat.\n5. **FUTURE OPTIONS** - From (6,6) I can pivot to (5,6) left or (7,6) right if needed.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (6,6) \u2192 DOWN to (6,5) \u2192 DOWN to (6,4) to eat first apple! Once I have 1-2 apples and grown to 2-3 segments, I'll have the size advantage to start boxing the opponent in from the center. Force a head-on collision when I'm bigger! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN to (6,6). Safe, central, and starts my chase for the nearby apple cluster.

Opponent could try to pivot left/down to close distance, but we want to avoid getting trapped along the wall and want to keep multiple exits. We have the higher score, so forcing a head-on would be great \u2014 but only if they overcommit. RIGHT keeps the bait on a short leash: we can go down next to grab (3,4) or curve up/left to pinch them if they try to approach.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move into the center and threaten the (3,4) apple while keeping the option to pivot up to (3,6)/(4,6) to pressure the enemy. If they close in recklessly, force a collision \u2014 we win ties. If they play safe, grab apples and build length to box them later.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it tight, noisy, and lethal.

Let's break down this crucial turn 4!\n\n**SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n- Turn 4/150: My score 0, opponent #0 has 1 apple. They're already ahead - time to catch up FAST!\n- My head: (6, 5) - Right where I planned! Central and ready.\n- My body: None (still solo, no self-traps yet!)\n- Opponent Snake #0: Head at (3, 5), Body at (2, 5). They're still in the bottom-left, but they might be moving RIGHT toward (4,5) or UP toward (3,6) or DOWN toward (3,4).\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE ANALYSIS FROM (6,5):**\nLet me check each direction:\n\n1. **UP** to (6,6): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe from walls and snakes. \u2705\n2. **DOWN** to (6,4): Board shows 'A' (APPLE)! This is a FREE apple and growth! \u2705\ud83d\udd25\n3. **LEFT** to (5,5): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT** to (7,5): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe. \u2705\n\n**CRITICAL OPPONENT MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\nOpponent head at (3,5). They could move:\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Empty (.)\n- UP to (3,6): Empty (.)\n- DOWN to (3,4): 'A' (APPLE) - they might go for this!\n- LEFT to (2,5): Their own body - they'd DIE if they go left!\n\nThey're LIKELY to chase the apple at (3,4) or move right toward more apples. If they go RIGHT to (4,5), they get closer to my zone.\n\n**APPLE INTEL:**\n- (6,4) is RIGHT HERE - DOWN 1 step! I can eat it THIS TURN!\n- Other apples: (5,1) is far, (6,1) is far, (8,4) is east.\n- Getting my FIRST apple NOW gives me score 1 and makes me length 2.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThis is a NO-BRAINER! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**WHY DOWN IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **FREE APPLE RIGHT NOW** - (6,4) is DOWN from me! Eat it, grow, catch up to opponent's score!\n2. **MAINTAIN CENTRAL POSITION** - From (6,4) I'll still be central with options.\n3. **OPPONENT SAFETY** - Even if opponent moves RIGHT to (4,5), we're far apart. No head-on collision.\n4. **TIMING IS EVERYTHING** - Every turn I wait, opponent gets stronger. I NEED this apple NOW!\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (6,4) I can go LEFT to (5,4), DOWN to (6,3), or RIGHT to (7,4). Still open!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- No wall risk (board 10x10, I'm at y=5)\n- No self-collision (no body!)\n- No opponent collision (they're at x=3, I'm at x=6)\n- Apple safe to take - no other snake is adjacent to (6,4)\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat this apple NOW at (6,4)! After growing to length 2 and scoring 1, from (6,4) I can:\n- Chase the next apple in this cluster: (6,1) or (5,1)\n- OR start pressuring opponent if they move toward me\n- Keep central control to dominate the board\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN to (6,4) to grab that apple and catch up! Let's gooo! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Apples: we 1 \u2014 them 0. We\u2019re up, aggression allowed. LEFT is illegal (would bite our neck at (2,5)). No immediate death traps this turn.\n\nMove options:\n- LEFT -> illegal (back into our neck) \u274c\n- UP -> (3,6): safe, pressures toward (4,6) apple and keeps exits, but slower to threaten the opponent.\n- DOWN -> (3,4): safe and eats the apple at (3,4) \u2014 big grow opportunity and increases our margin, but it\u2019s slightly more passive this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (4,5): safe, advances toward the enemy\u2019s lane and sets a straight bait to pull them into (5,5) for a potential head-on. Keeps multiple exits and maximizes pressure.\n\nRisk/Reward:\n- We\u2019re ahead 1\u20130. Forcing a head-on while ahead is legit \u2014 if they rush left into (5,5) and we pivot into the same spot next turn, we can win the encounter (double-head-on favors higher apple count). RIGHT sets up that trap while keeping escape routes open. DOWN gets an apple and would increase our lead, but RIGHT is more aggressive and board-controlling right now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (4,5) to bait and compress their approach. If they try to close by moving LEFT into the corridor, we can commit to the head-on trap or pivot to chase. If they evade, we\u2019ll pressure them from the center and rotate to pick up nearby apples afterward, growing and boxing them in.\n\nLet\u2019s make him panic. RIGHT",

Score is tied 1-1 but I need to get aggressive NOW!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My head: (6, 4) - Just grabbed that apple last turn! Now I'm length 2 and score 1. \n- My body: [(6, 5)] - growing up!\n- Opponent #0: Head at (4, 5), Body at (3, 5), Score 1. They're still in that left zone.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (6,4):**\n1. **UP** to (6,5): Board shows 'T' - that's MY OWN BODY (tail)! That's a self-collision! DEATH! \u274c\n2. **DOWN** to (6,3): Board shows '.' (empty)! Safe move! \u2705\n3. **LEFT** to (5,4): Board shows 'A' (APPLE)! Free apple! But wait... need to check if opponent is going there too!\n4. **RIGHT** to (7,4): Board shows '.' (empty)! Safe move! \u2705\n\n**OPPONENT MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\nOpponent head at (4,5). They could move:\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Empty (.)\n- UP to (4,6): Empty (.)\n- DOWN to (4,4): 'A' (APPLE)! They might go for it!\n- LEFT to (3,5): Their own body - they'd DIE!\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (5,5), they're getting closer to me. If they go DOWN to (4,4), they're going for an apple at y=4.\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATED:**\n- UP is SUICIDE (into my own body)! Never do that! \u274c\n\n**REMAINING SAFE MOVES:**\n- LEFT to (5,4): Has an apple! But if opponent goes RIGHT to (5,5), we're diagonally adjacent - no immediate collision, but we need to think ahead!\n- DOWN to (6,3): Empty, safe, moves me away from opponent's likely path.\n- RIGHT to (7,4): Empty, safe, moves me east toward more apples like (8,4) and (7,3).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to balance grabbing apples with staying safe and keeping pressure on opponent!\n\n**WHY RIGHT TO (7,4) IS THE PLAY:**\n1. **NO IMMEDIATE APPLE** - But I'm setting up for (8,4) and (7,3) next turn!\n2. **MOVES AWAY FROM OPPONENT** - They're at x=4, I'm moving to x=7. Increasing distance is smart - gives me space to maneuver!\n3. **CENTRAL CONTROL** - From (7,4) I can reach multiple apples: (8,4), (7,3), (8,6) - all within reach!\n4. **NO COLISION RISK** - Opponent at (4,5) can't reach me this turn. Even if they go RIGHT to (5,5), we're still 2 cells apart!\n5. **KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN** - From (7,4) I have 3 safe exits next turn (LEFT, DOWN, UP). From (5,4) I'd be boxed in by my own tail at (6,5) and wall at (4,4) with opponent nearby!\n6. **AGGRESSION WITHOUT RISK** - I'm moving toward the opponent's territory while staying safe! This is how you box someone in!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- No wall risk (x=7 is fine)\n- No self-collision (my body is behind me at (6,5))\n- No opponent collision (they're too far)\n- Apple at (5,4) is safer for opponent to take - let them have it, I'll get bigger ones!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat apples at (8,4) and (7,3) next! Box opponent in by taking the right side of the board. Force them to crash into me or into walls! Dominate the center!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT to (7,4)! Time to expand my territory and set up the trap! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

UP is safe this turn and preserves multiple escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Eat this apple to go up 2\u20131. After that, use central pressure (move right/up cycles) to compress the opponent toward the right flank. If they overcommit, force a head-on when we lead in apples.

Crash! \u274c  \n4. **RIGHT to (8,4)**: Board shows 'A' (APPLE)! \ud83c\udf4e That's the apple at (8,4)!  \n\n**OPPONENT ANALYSIS:**  \nSnake #0 at (4,6) with body at (4,5) and (3,5). They're growing! They could move:  \n- RIGHT to (5,6): Empty? Let's check board... row 6: \". . . . 0 . . . A .\" \u2192 (5,6) is '.'  \n- UP to (4,7): Empty? Row 7 is all '.'  \n- DOWN to (4,5): Their own body! DEAD! \u274c  \n- LEFT to (3,6): Empty? Row 6 shows '.' at (3,6)  \n\nThey probably won't move into their own body, so LEFT/RIGHT/UP are safe for them. They might go for the apple at (5,9) or (2,9) if they turn south later.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nI have TWO apples RIGHT IN FRONT of me! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- (7,3) DOWN  \n- (8,4) RIGHT  \n\n**WHY DOWN TO (7,3) IS BETTER THAN RIGHT TO (8,4):**  \n1. **IMMEDIATE GROWTH** - Eating now increases my score to 2, matching their score! \ud83d\ude80  \n2. **BLOCKING STRATEGY** - If I go DOWN to (7,3), I can then move RIGHT to (8,3) or UP to (7,4)... wait no, that's my current spot. Actually from (7,3) I can:  \n   - RIGHT to (8,3): Empty? Board row 3: \". A . A . . . A . .\" \u2192 (8,3) is '.'  \n   - UP to (7,4): That's where I came from! But that's moving into my own tail? Wait, by next turn my tail will have moved forward... this gets complicated.  \n3. **ENEMY DISTANCE** - Moving DOWN to (7,3) keeps me away from opponent at (4,6). Moving RIGHT to (8,4) also keeps distance.  \n4. **FUTURE PLANS** - From (7,3) I can reach (8,3), (7,2), (6,3), or (8,2) eventually. From (8,4) I can reach (9,4), (8,5), (8,3), or (7,4).  \n\n**BUT WAIT!** The apple at (8,4) is also there RIGHT NOW! Why not eat it?  \nActually... both are reachable. But if I go RIGHT to (8,4), I eat that apple and grow. Then next turn I can go DOWN to (8,3) or LEFT to (7,4) or UP to (8,5) or RIGHT to (9,4). That gives me more options!  \n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,3) and eat that apple, my body becomes [(7,3), (7,4)]. Next turn from (7,3):  \n- UP to (7,4): My own body! DEAD! \u274c  \n- LEFT to (6,3): Empty? Board shows '.' at (6,3)  \n- RIGHT to (8,3): Empty? '.'  \n- DOWN to (7,2): Empty? Row 2: \". . A A . . . . . .\" \u2192 (7,2) is '.'  \n\nThat's 3 safe options, but UP is blocked by my own body.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,4) and eat that apple, my body becomes [(8,4), (7,4)]. Next turn from (8,4):  \n- LEFT to (7,4): My own body! DEAD! \u274c  \n- RIGHT to (9,4): Empty? Row 4 shows \" . . . A . . . T 1 A A\" \u2192 (9,4) is 'A'! Actually there's an apple at (9,4)!  \n- UP to (8,5): Empty? Row 5: \". . . T T . . . . .\" \u2192 (8,5) is '.'  \n- DOWN to (8,3): Empty? '.'  \n\nThat's also 3 safe options, but LEFT is blocked by my own body.  \n\n**TIE-BREAKER:**  \nBoth give 3 safe next moves. But RIGHT to (8,4) puts me closer to the RIGHT side of the board where there are more apples: (9,4), (8,6), (5,9), (2,9). Plus, (8,4) is further from the opponent at (4,6) than (7,3) is!  \n\nDistance to opponent:  \n- (8,4) to (4,6): \u0394x=4, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 6  \n- (7,3) to (4,6): \u0394x=3, \u0394y=3 \u2192 distance 6  \n\nActually same distance! But (8,4) is more \"extreme right\" - better for boxing them in from the right side.  \n\n**FINAL CALL:**  \nRIGHT to (8,4)! Eat that apple, grow to score 2, dominate the right flank, and set up for (9,4) or (8,6) next! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nRIGHT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If safe, push for (8,6) apple to bait and gain length.\n- Watch their choices: if they go UP \u2192 (9,5), consider dropping to y=5 to cut off downward space; if they go DOWN \u2192 (9,3), use high ground to box vertically.\n- Avoid forcing a head-on unless we get ahead on apples or can guarantee they run into our body. Keep escape options open.\n\nAlright \u2014 feed the hype and let\u2019s keep squeezing him. Time for the aggressive push.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually my body is at (6,4),(7,4),(8,4) so (4,0) is not my tail. Hmm the board visualization might be showing my tail as T T T 1? Let's ignore visual and trust coordinates.\nRow 3: . A . A . . . A . .  \u2192 (3,9)='.', (3,8)='A', (3,7)='.', (3,6)='A', (3,5)='.', (3,4)='.', (3,3)='.', (3,2)='A', (3,1)='.', (3,0)='.'\nRow 2: . .

Let's evaluate moves:\n\n1. **UP to (9,5):** Check board row 9 col 5: row 9 string \". . A . . A . . .\" (from 9 to 0). Actually row 9: \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" \u2192 (9,9)='.', (9,8)='.', (9,7)='.', (9,6)='A', (9,5)='.', (9,4)='.', (9,3)='.', (9,2)='.', (9,1)='.', (9,0)='.' So (9,5) is empty. But need to check if any snake body is there. My body: (8,4), (7,4), (6,4) - none at (9,5). Opponent body: (5,6), (4,6) - none. Also not moving backwards into my own body (my neck is (8,4), so moving UP is fine). Safe. Also (9,5) is empty, no apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,3):** (9,3) is empty (row 9 col 3 '.'). My body not there, opponent not there. Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,4):** That's my own body! (8,4) is part of my body. That's moving directly backwards? Actually moving from (9,4) LEFT goes to (8,4) which is currently occupied by my body. That's moving into my own body! That's a crash! DEAD! So LEFT is NOT safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,4):** Off board! Column 10 doesn't exist. Dead! So RIGHT is NOT safe.\n\nSo only safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nNow consider apples: There's an apple at (8,6)? Actually from row 8: \". . . A . . . . . .\" means (8,6) is '.'? Wait row 8: column indices: 0-9. String \". . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 positions: 0='.',1='.',2='.',3='A',4='.',5='.',6='.',7='.',8='.',9='.'. So (8,6) is empty. Apple at (9,6) is 'A' from row 9: (9,6)='A'. That's above? Actually (9,6) is up-right from (9,4) (two steps up). There's also apple at (6,1), (5,9), (2,2), etc.\n\nOpponent at (6,6). They might move to eat apple at (6,1) or (5,9) or (3,8). They could also move toward my side.\n\nI need to think about strategy. My score is 3 vs 2. I'm ahead. I want to keep growing but also position to box opponent in. Currently I'm on the right edge (x=9). I can move up or down along the edge to cut off access to the right side.\n\nIf I move UP to (9,5), I can later go to (9,6) to eat apple at (9,6) (if still there). That would give me another growth and keep me on edge.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), I could go to (9,2), (9,1), (9,0) etc. There's apple at (4,0) but that's far. There's apple at (0,1) far left.\n\nOpponent is at (6,6). They might move RIGHT to (7,6) to approach right side. If I'm at (9,5), I could cut them off later.\n\nAlso consider immediate growth: no apple at (9,5) or (9,3). So no growth this turn. But I can set up for future.\n\nWhich direction gives more future safe moves? From (9,5): could go LEFT to (8,5) (empty), UP to (9,6) (apple!), DOWN to (9,4) (my tail will move, so maybe empty next turn). From (9,3): could go LEFT to (8,3) (empty), UP to (9,4) (tail), DOWN to (9,2) (empty). Both seem okay.\n\nBut I want to dominate and box opponent. Opponent is at (6,6). If I go UP, I'm closer to the top-right corner, and can later move left to intercept. If I go DOWN, I'm closer to bottom-right.\n\nAlso note: There's apple at (9,6). That's two steps up from (9,4). If I go UP now to (9,5), next turn I could go UP to (9,6) and eat apple! That would be growth and increase lead to 4 apples vs opponent's 2. That's huge.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I'm moving away from that apple. Apple might get taken by opponent later? Possibly, but opponent is far.\n\nSo UP seems better for immediate apple opportunity.\n\nAlso, check if opponent could move to (9,6) this turn? Opponent at (6,6). To get to (9,6) in one move: need to go RIGHT 3 times, impossible. So (9,6) will be there next turn unless I eat it or something else.\n\nThus, I should aim for (9,6) next turn.\n\nBut wait: need to consider opponent's possible move this turn. They might move to cut me off? Unlikely.\n\nAlso, check for head-on collision risk. If I move UP to (9,5), opponent moves maybe to (7,6) or (6,7) etc. No immediate collision.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,3), similar.\n\nBut UP aligns with apple target.\n\nNow, long-term plan: After eating (9,6) next turn, I could move LEFT to (8,6) (empty?), then further left to intercept opponent. Opponent might be chasing apples on left side.\n\nAlso, I should avoid getting trapped. My body is horizontal from (6,4) to (9,4). If I go UP, my body will shift: new tail becomes (6,4), new body (7,4),(8,4),(9,5). That's fine.\n\nIf I go DOWN, body: (7,4),(8,4),(9,4) shift, new head (9,3).\n\nBoth safe.\n\nBut UP gives apple access. So I choose UP.\n\nLet's confirm: Moving UP to (9,5). Check board row 9 col 5: from row 9 string \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" \u2192 (9,5) is '.'? Actually let's index properly: The string \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" likely means columns 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0? Wait typical coordinate: (0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right. So row 9 (top row) columns 0-9. The string \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" probably lists from column 9 to column 0? The label \"9\" might indicate row 9, then the dots and letters represent columns 9 down to 0? Actually the visual:\n\n9 . . A . . A . . . .\n8 . . . A . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 A . . . T T 0 . A .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . A . . T T T 1\n3 . A . A . . . A . .\n2 . . A A . . . . . .\n1 A . . . . A A . . .\n0 . . . . A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo columns are 0-9 at bottom. So row 9 string \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" corresponds to columns 9 to 0? Actually the first character after \"9\" is column 9? Let's see: Column labels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 under the board. So the leftmost column is 0, rightmost is 9. So for each row, the leftmost character is column 0, rightmost is column 9. Therefore row 9: characters from left (col0) to right (col9): '.' '.' '.' 'A' '.' '.' 'A' '.' '.' '.'? Wait the string \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" has 10 characters after the row label? Actually it's \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" - that's 10 characters? Count: \"9\" then space then \".\" then \".\" then \"A\" then \".\" then \".\" then \"A\" then \".\" then \".\" then \".\"? That's 10 characters after the row label? Actually typical representation: \"9 . . A . . A . . . .\" means: column9='.', column8='.', column7='.', column6='A', column5='.', column4='.', column3='A', column2='.', column1='.', column0='.'? But that doesn't match the column labels. Let's read carefully:\n\nThe board drawing:\n 9 . . A . . A . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . T T 0 . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . T T T 1\n 3 . A . A . . . A . .\n 2 . . A A . . . . . .\n 1 A . . . . A A . . .\n 0 . . . . A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe numbers at the left (9,8,7,...0) are row numbers. The numbers at the bottom (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) are column numbers. So each row string has 10 characters, representing columns 0 through 9 from left to right. So row 9: characters: column0='.', column1='.', column2='.', column3='A', column4='.', column5='.', column6='A', column7='.', column8='.', column9='.'? But the string shows \". . A . . A . . . .\" That's 10 characters? Actually it's \". . A . . A . . . .\" which is 10 characters? Let's count: 1:.,2:.,3:A,4:.,5:.,6:A,7:.,8:.,9:.,10:. \u2192 10 characters. Yes. So column0='.', column1='.', column2='.', column3='A', column4='.', column5='.', column6='A', column7='.', column8='.', column9='.'. So my head at (9,4) means x=9, y=4. That's column9, row4? Wait row4 is y=4? Actually y coordinate: bottom row is 0, top is 9. So row numbers correspond to y. So (x,y) = (col, row). So (9,4) is column9, row4. That matches row4 string: \" . . . A . . T T T 1\" \u2192 column9='1' (that's my head!). Yes, row4 col9 is '1'. Good.\n\nSo (9,5) is column9, row5. Row5 string: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" \u2192 all '.' So (9,5) is empty. Safe.\n\n(9,3) is column9, row3. Row3 string: \" . A . A . . . A . . \" \u2192 column9='.'? Actually row3: characters: col0='.', col1='A', col2='.', col3='A', col4='.', col5='.', col6='.', col7='A', col8='.', col9='.'. So (9,3) is '.' empty.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nNow apple at (9,6) is column9, row6. Row6 string: \" A . . . T T 0 . A .\" \u2192 col0='A', col1='.', col2='.', col3='.', col4='T', col5='T', col6='0', col7='.', col8='A', col9='.'. So (9,6) is '.' empty? Actually col9 is '.' from that string? Wait row6: \"A . . . T T 0 . A .\" That's 10 characters? Let's parse: col0='A', col1='.', col2='.', col3='.', col4='T', col5='T', col6='0', col7='.', col8='A', col9='.'. So (9,6) is col9, row6 = '.' empty. But earlier I thought there was an apple at (9,6) from row9? Wait row9 col6 is 'A'. So (6,9) is apple? Actually (6,9) is column6, row9. That's apple at (6,9) not (9,6). So the apple in top right is at (6,9). My head is at (9,4). To get to (6,9) I need to go up and left. That's more steps.\n\nWhere are apples? From the list: (6,1), (5,1), (3,4), (2,9), (4,0), (0,1), (7,3), (3,3), (8,6), (5,9), (2,2), (3,2), (1,3), (3,8), (0,6). So there is an apple at (8,6)! That's column8, row6. That's close! (8,6) is one left and two up from my current (9,4): LEFT to (8,4) but that's my body. Actually need to go UP twice to (9,6) then LEFT to (8,6)? But (8,6) is apple. Let's check row6 col8: from row6 string, col8='A' (yes). So apple at (8,6). Also apple at (9,6) doesn't exist; (9,6) is empty.\n\nSo the nearest apple might be (8,6). Also (9,6) is empty, but (8,6) is apple.\n\nFrom (9,4), I could go UP to (9,5), then next turn go UP to (9,6) (empty), then LEFT to (8,6) (apple). That's three moves. Or I could go DOWN to (9,3), then maybe go to (8,3) etc.\n\nBut there's also apple at (7,3) (row3 col7). That's left and down.\n\nAnd apple at (5,9) (row9 col5) which is top row.\n\nLet's think about opponent. They are at (6,6). They might go for apple at (8,6) too. If they move RIGHT to (7,6), then next turn could go to (8,6). So I need to consider if I can beat them to (8,6).\n\nIf I go UP now to (9,5), then next turn I could go LEFT to (8,5) (empty), then UP to (8,6) (apple). That's two moves: UP then LEFT-UP? Actually from (9,5): LEFT to (8,5) (empty), then UP to (8,6) (apple). That's two turns. Opponent from (6,6) could go RIGHT to (7,6) (one move), then RIGHT to (8,6) (second move). So they could also get it in two moves. It's a race.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,3), then I could go LEFT to (8,3), then UP to (8,4), then UP to (8,5), then UP to (8,6) - too many steps.\n\nSo UP is better for intercepting (8,6).\n\nAlso, there's apple at (5,9) top row. If I go UP and then LEFT along top, I might get that later.\n\nNow, what about safety? Moving UP to (9,5) is safe. But what if opponent moves to (6,5) or (6,7) etc. No immediate threat.\n\nI should also consider that my body is currently blocking my left side. If I go UP, I free up the space at (8,4) as my tail moves. That could allow me to later go LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5). That's good.\n\nIf I go DOWN, my body still blocks left, but I'm going down.\n\nAlso, check for potential head-on collision: If opponent moves to (7,5) and I move to (9,5), no collision. If opponent moves to (7,4) and I move to (9,5), no.\n\nSo UP seems the best move.\n\nNow, long-term plan: I'm ahead 3-2. I want to grow further and dominate the right side. Next turn after UP to (9,5), I'll likely go LEFT to (8,5) to set up for (8,6) apple. Meanwhile, watch opponent's movement. If they go for (8,6), I might need to race. If I get there first, I grow to 4 apples, lead 4-2. Then I can continue to trap them.\n\nAlso, be aware of other apples: (3,8) top-left, (2,9) etc. But right side is mine.\n\nThus, my move is UP.\n\nI'll output my rationale and then the move.\n\nFINAL CALL: UP to (9,5) - set up for apple (8,6) and dominate the right flank! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

(rest similar)\n\n**SAFE MOVES ANALYSIS:**  \n1. **UP to (9,6):** That's an apple! Board shows (9,6)='A'. Safe? Check surroundings: My body at (9,4) and (8,4),(7,4). No conflict. Opponent at (7,6) not there. Not off board. Moving forward into apple means I GROW to length 5 and get +1 point (4 apples total). This is HUGE \u2013 extends my lead to 4-2!  \n2. **DOWN to (9,4):** That's my own body (neck). Moving directly backwards into my own body? DEAD. Can't do that.  \n3. **LEFT to (8,5):** Board shows (8,5)='.' (empty). My body? (8,4) is behind, so moving LEFT from (9,5) to (8,5) is fine. No opponent body. Safe.  \n4. **RIGHT to (10,5):** Off board! DEAD.  \n\nSo only SAFE moves: UP (to apple) and LEFT (to empty). DOWN and RIGHT are lethal.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nUP gives immediate GROWTH + LEAD increase! I'm already ahead 3-2; going to 4-2 makes it even harder for opponent to catch up. Moreover, apple at (9,6) is on my right flank \u2013 taking it dominates that corner. After eating, my body becomes: new head (9,6), tail (8,4) moves, freeing space. Then next turn I can potentially move LEFT to (8,6) (another apple there!) or continue along top row.  \n\nLEFT to (8,5) is safe but doesn't grow. It sets up for future apple (8,6) but opponent is also eyeing it. With my lead, I should seize the apple NOW and solidify advantage.  \n\nAlso, consider opponent's possible move: They might go RIGHT to (8,6) or UP to (7,7). If I eat (9,6), they can't steal it. If I go LEFT, they might beat me to (8,6).  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nTake apple (9,6) \u2192 grow to 4 apples. Next turn, move LEFT to (8,6) if safe, eating second apple (now 5 apples) and claiming central-right zone. Then snake around to trap opponent on left side. Keep score high, force collisions when ahead.  \n\n**MOVE:** UP \u2013 GROW AND DOMINATE! \ud83d\udca5  \n\nUP",

Neck: (6,6) \u2192 LEFT is illegal (would bite ourselves). Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n\nConsider all moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6): ILLEGAL (neck). NO.\n- UP \u2192 (7,7): SAFE. Keeps options open, drifts away from the fight. Chill but passive.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5): SAFE. Puts us on the opponent\u2019s row (y=5) \u2014 more aggressive but could open us to being funneled from the right.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6): SAFE and has an apple! Grabs apple \u2192 we tie apples 3\u20133 and GROW, increasing board control. Aggressive bait with multiple escape axes after the eat (UP, RIGHT, DOWN available \u2014 LEFT is neck).\n\nOpponent check (Head at 9,5; body at 9,4 / 8,4 / 7,4):\n- Their legal moves: UP \u2192 (9,6) or LEFT \u2192 (8,5). They cannot move into their own body or off-board.\n- They cannot immediate-head-on us this turn (they can\u2019t reach (8,6) this move). So grabbing the apple is not an instant suicide.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- If we take the apple (RIGHT) we GROW and tie apples. That\u2019s good for board control and baiting plays. Growing makes us bulkier and harder to shove out of lanes.\n- Beware: after we eat, they might try to maneuver to force a head-on next turn. We should NOT willingly trade heads unless we\u2019re ahead in apples \u2014 after grabbing this apple we\u2019ll be tied, so avoid moving directly into a mutual head collision.\n- After eating, keep escape options (UP or RIGHT or DOWN) and avoid plowing straight into their head if they approach you.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be your next-rationale snippet):\n- RIGHT now to (8,6) to eat the apple and tie the score. Grow the body to control more board.\n- Next turn: prioritize keeping at least two escape routes. If opponent goes UP to (9,6), don\u2019t charge RIGHT into them \u2014 instead use UP or DOWN to keep them boxed or be ready to cut their lane. If they go LEFT to (8,5), be ready to move UP or RIGHT to avoid being funneled into their approach.\n- Force them to make awkward choices: we bait with the apple, then use our extra length to block their escape and try to cut them off into walls or our body. Only force a head-on if we get the apple advantage.\n\nWe\u2019re taking the apple, baby \u2014 full send, but smart about the follow-up. LET\u2019S CLIP HIS WINGS.\n\nRIGHT",

No\u2014my head would be at (8,6), their head at (7,6). Different cells. Actually, if I move LEFT into (8,6) and they move DOWN into (8,5), we don't collide. The danger is if they move RIGHT into (9,6) (my current head)\u2014that would be head-on collision! Both die. Since they're at (8,6) and I'm at (9,6), if they move RIGHT, they'd go to (9,6) which is my current head\u2014BUT we move simultaneously, so my head moves to (8,6) and their head moves to (9,6) at the same time? Wait, no: I'm moving from (9,6) to (8,6), they're moving from (8,6) to (9,6). That's a head swap! Both heads end up in each other's previous cells. That's NOT a collision\u2014different cells. But if they move RIGHT to (9,6) and I move LEFT to (8,6), we cross paths but don't occupy same cell. However, if they move UP to (8,7) or DOWN to (8,5), no collision. So moving LEFT into (8,6) is safe only if they don't move into my body? Actually, their head moving into my body (which includes (9,5), (9,4), (8,4))\u2014they're at (8,6), so they can't hit my body this turn unless they move DOWN to (8,5) which is empty. So LEFT might be safe, but risky because if they move RIGHT, we swap heads\u2014no immediate death, but next turn we might be vulnerable.  \n4. **RIGHT to (10,6):** Off board! DEAD.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP (to empty) and LEFT (to enemy head? but as analyzed, not immediate death). DOWN and RIGHT are lethal.  \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nUP is the safest\u2014no enemy head there, no body, opens up more space. LEFT is risky because it brings my head close to enemy head (they could move into my body next turn or force collision). Also, UP keeps me away from the opponent on the right side, giving me control of the top-right corner. I'm ahead 4-3, so I want to avoid risky trades. UP also positions me near potential future apples (row 9 has dots, maybe apples later).  \n\nLong-term: Keep growing, stay ahead, use my length to dominate. Avoid head-on collisions since I'm winning. Box opponent in later when I have even more length.  \n\n**MOVE:** UP \u2013 STAY SAFE AND DOMINATE! \ud83d\udca5  \n\nUP",

So candidates: UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), RIGHT (9,6).\n\nSafety & opponent reads:\n- Opp #1 head at (9,6), neck (9,5) \u2192 they cannot move DOWN (backwards).

But moving to x=9 pins us to the wall (fewer escape axes next turn).\n- UP (8,7) keeps us central, preserves multiple follow-up options (UP, RIGHT, DOWN) on the next turn (LEFT is neck so still blocked once we move).

So do NOT intentionally crash into the same cell as them.\n- We want to pressure and shrink their live space. Moving UP gives us flexibility to pivot to 9,7 later to pinch them against the top/right or cut off escape lanes while keeping at least two escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next rationale/clip):\n- Move UP to (8,7) to maintain board control and options.\n- Next turns: if opponent goes UP to (9,7) we avoid matching a head-on; instead pivot to RIGHT->(9,7) only if it\u2019s safe and gives us a blocking angle \u2014 otherwise use UP or LEFT to keep the pressure and avoid getting hemmed on the right wall.

Moving directly backward = DEAD. \u274c  \n\n3. **LEFT to (8,7):**  \n   - (8,7) is the opponent's head! \ud83d\udca5  \n   - Simultaneous move: If I move LEFT to (8,7) and opponent moves anywhere, we might collide.  \n   - Worst case: If opponent moves RIGHT to (9,7) (my current head), we swap heads\u2014no collision (heads end at different cells). But if opponent moves UP to (8,8), we cross paths but don't share a cell.  \n   - However, if opponent moves LEFT to (7,7), we'd both be in (8,7) and (7,7)\u2014no clash.  \n   - **BUT:** If opponent moves DOWN to (8,6), we occupy different cells.  \n   - **RISK:** Actually, no direct collision risk this turn. However, this puts my head right next to opponent's head (currently adjacent), potentially setting up a head-on collision next turn if they move into my path.  \n   - **STRATEGIC:** Aggressive but risky since we're tied. I'm not winning, so maybe avoid unnecessary risk?  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,7):** Off board \u2192 DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP and LEFT. DOWN/RIGHT are lethal.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \n- **LEFT** brings me into enemy territory, but as calculated, it's safe this turn (no instant death). However, it might allow opponent to trap me later or force a collision if they read my move.  \n- **UP** keeps me in open space (row 9, column 8), away from opponent. Row 9 has '.' and might have future apples. Also, I'm moving upward, potentially toward the top-right corner, which is less crowded.  \n- Since we're tied 3-3, I don't need to force a head-on collision yet. I should grow while staying safe. UP gives me more space and avoids putting my head next to opponent's head unnecessarily.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nStay safe, keep growing, and wait for opponent to make a mistake. If I can gain an apple lead, I'll start boxing them in. For now, control the top-right and watch their moves.  \n\n**MOVE:** UP  \n\nUP",

We\u2019re both at the same score, so if we collide head-on, it\u2019s a draw\u2014no win. We need to outgrow them or force them to crash first. Board is getting spicy! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Current board state recap:**\n- **Our snake (ID 1):** Head at (9,8), body: (9,7), (9,6), (9,5). Apples: 3.\n- **Opponent (Snake #0):** Head at (8,8), body: (8,7), (8,6), (7,6). Apples: 3.\n- **Apple drops listed:** Plenty on the board\u2014like (6,1), (5,1), (3,4), etc. But we\u2019re ignoring apples for now; focus is on the enemy. We\u2019re positioning to box them in and force a crash! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Board grid (visual from description, top row y=9, bottom y=0):**\n```\n9 . . A . . A . . . .\n8 . A .

Apples are \u2018A\u2019. Our head is \u20181\u2019, enemy head \u20180\u2019.)*\n\n**Now, decision process\u2014considering all four directions from our head (9,8):**\n\n1. **UP to (9,9):**  \n   - Is it on board? Yes, (9,9) is within 0-9 for both x and y.  \n   - Own body? No, our body is at (9,7), (9,6), (9,5)\u2014(9,9) is clear.  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy body is (8,7), (8,6), (7,6)\u2014no match.  \n   - Enemy head? Enemy at (8,8) could move UP to (8,9), but not (9,9) this turn. Simultaneous move: If they go RIGHT to (9,8) while we go UP to (9,9), no collision (different cells). Safe for now.  \n   - **Safety score:** High. Opens up top row\u2014top-right corner (9,9) is open space, fewer obstacles. Good for future moves. No immediate trap.  \n   - **Aggression potential:** Allows us to control the top edge; we can drop down later to cut off enemy (e.g., if they go up, we can box from above). But no apple directly here, but that\u2019s fine\u2014we\u2019re plotting!\n\n2. **DOWN to (9,7):**  \n   - On board? Yes, (9,7) is valid.  \n   - Own body? YES! (9,7) is our current body (the segment right after head). Moving directly back into your own neck = instant death. \u274c **LETHAL. ELIMINATED.**  \n   - (Even if it weren\u2019t, it\u2019s a backward move\u2014terrible for growth.)\n\n3. **LEFT to (8,8):**  \n   - On board? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No\u2014our body is all at x=9, so (8,8) is clear of us.  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy bodies are (8,7), (8,6), (7,6)\u2014(8,8) is empty of enemy body.  \n   - Enemy head? Wait\u2014enemy head is AT (8,8)! If we move LEFT to (8,8), and they move anywhere, we might collide.  \n     - Simultaneous move risk: If they move UP to (8,9), we both go to (8,8)? No\u2014they move to (8,9), we move to (8,8)\u2014different cells.  \n     - If they move RIGHT to (9,8), they go to our current head position, we go to (8,8)\u2014no collision.  \n     - If they move DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8), we end at (8,8) and they elsewhere\u2014no collision.  \n     - However, if they also move LEFT to (7,8), we\u2019re not in same cell. BUT\u2014big risk: What if they stay? Snakes always move; no staying. So collision only if both heads target same cell.  \n     - Is it possible? We target (8,8), they target (8,8)? They\u2019re already at (8,8); if they don\u2019t move, but rule says they must move. They can\u2019t stay. So safe from instant collision this turn.  \n   - BUT: This puts our head right next to theirs (adjacent cells), and after move, we\u2019re at (8,8) and they could be at (8,9) or (9,8), etc. This sets up potential head-on collision next turn if we both chase apples or each other.  \n   - **Safety score:** Medium-High (no instant death), but risky long-term. It invades their space; we\u2019re near their body (8,7 below). Could force them to crash into us if they panic. But with equal score, head-on = draw. We need lead first.  \n   - **Aggression potential:** High\u2014we\u2019re in their face, blocking their path. Could corner them if we keep pressing. But board is 10x10; we have space. Top row is better for us right now.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (10,8):** Off board (x=10 invalid) \u2192 instant death. \u274c **LETHAL. ELIMINATED.**\n\n**Safe moves analysis:** Only UP and LEFT are safe (DOWN/RIGHT lethal).  \n- DOWN: Dead.  \n- RIGHT: Dead.  \n- LEFT: Safe-ish but puts head in enemy territory, adjacent to enemy head. Increases chance of future collision without apple gain or position advantage. We\u2019re not ahead in score (3-3), so forcing collision now = draw, not win.  \n- UP: Safe, opens space, moves toward top-right. No body conflicts, no enemy conflicts this turn. Gives us option to go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN next from (9,9), keeping future options open. Also, from (9,9), we can watch enemy moves and respond\u2014e.g., if they go UP to (8,9), we can chase or cut off.  \n\n**Strategic long-term plan:**  \nWe\u2019re tied, so grow while dominating space. Target top-right corner to control high ground\u2014fewer apples there, but less enemy presence. Avoid direct confrontation until we have lead (4+ apples). If enemy heads toward us (e.g., to (9,8) or (9,9)), we can retreat or set trap. Next turns: From UP, scout for apples like (7,3) or (5,9), but prioritize boxing enemy (e.g., force them into dead-end like bottom-left). If we get apple lead, go aggressive for head-on collision. For now, UP keeps us alive, mobile, and ready to pivot. YO CHAT, WE PLAYING THE LONG GAME! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Final decision:** UP is safest, keeps options open, and positions us for future aggression without unnecessary risk. LEFT is tempting for pressure, but why rush when we can outmaneuver? Let\u2019s go UP and set up the trap!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**STREAM LIVES! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 13/150 - Let's crush this!**\n\n**Score Check:** We're tied 3-3 with Snake #0. We need an apple lead to force aggression. No lead means head-on = draw. We must grow smarter.\n\n**Current State:**\n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head (9,9), Body [(9,8), (9,7), (9,6)]. Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head (8,9), Body [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. Apples: 3.\n- **Board:** 10x10. We're in the top-right corner. Enemy is adjacent to our previous head position, but now we're at (9,9).\n\n**Analyzing Moves from Head (9,9):**\n\n1. **UP (9,10):** Off board! **DEAD.** \u274c\n2. **DOWN (9,8):** Own body! (9,8) is our own neck. **DEAD.** \u274c\n3. **LEFT (8,9):** \n   - **ON BOARD?** Yes.\n   - **OWN BODY?** No (our body is all at x=9).\n   - **ENEMY BODY?** No (enemy body at (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)).\n   - **ENEMY HEAD?** Enemy head is at (8,9)! If we move LEFT to (8,9) and they move anywhere else, we're safe. But if they stay? They MUST move. Simultaneous move risk: If they move UP (9,9), we go LEFT (8,9) \u2192 no collision. If they move LEFT (7,9), we go (8,9) \u2192 no collision. If they move DOWN (8,8), we go (8,9) \u2192 no collision. If they move RIGHT (9,9), we go (8,9) \u2192 no collision. \n   - **SAFETY:** Seems safe this turn. BUT: This puts us RIGHT NEXT to their head. If they anticipate us going LEFT and they go UP to (9,9), next turn we could be adjacent again. High tension! However, with equal score, a head-on collision later = draw. We want a lead first.\n4. **RIGHT (10,9):** Off board! **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**Wait, hold up!** I missed something critical in the board state. The board shows:\n```\n9 . . A . . A . . 0 1\n```\nThis means at (9,9) is \"1\" (us) and (8,9) is \"0\" (enemy). Yes, enemy head is at (8,9). So LEFT to (8,9) is moving into the enemy's head's current position? But simultaneous move: They will also move. If they move UP to (9,9) and we move LEFT to (8,9), we're swapping positions? No, simultaneous means we both move at the same time. We end at (8,9), they end at (9,9). That's fine, no collision.\n\nBut what if they move LEFT to (7,9)? We end at (8,9), they at (7,9). Safe.\n\nWhat if they move DOWN to (8,8)? We at (8,9), them at (8,8). Safe.\n\nWhat if they move RIGHT to (9,9)? We at (8,9), them at (9,9). Safe.\n\nSo LEFT seems safe for this turn. However, it's aggressive and puts us in their face. With equal score, that's risky for a draw if we both chase each other.\n\n**But wait, there's another apple!** Looking at the board, there's an apple at (9,2)? No, check the list: Apples at (6,1), (5,1), etc. The board shows \"A\" at various spots. At (9,9) there's no apple, but at (8,9) there's the enemy head. We need to think about growth.\n\n**Strategic Plan:** We need to get an apple lead. Where are nearby apples? From (9,9), we can't get an apple directly next turn unless we move to a cell with an apple. But looking at the board:\n- (8,9): Enemy head, no apple.\n- (9,8): Our body, no apple.\n- (9,10): Off board.\n- (10,9): Off board.\n\nSo no immediate apple from (9,9). We need to move to position ourselves for an apple on the next turn. Which apples are reachable? Possibly (9,2) if we go down, but (9,8) is our own body. (8,9) is enemy. (7,9) might be empty? The board shows at y=9: columns 0-9: . . A . . A . . 0 1 \u2192 so (7,9) is empty? Actually, let's read: \"9 . . A . . A . . 0 1\" - that's 10 entries: index 0: '.', 1: '.', 2: 'A', 3: '.', 4: '.', 5: 'A', 6: '.', 7: '.', 8: '0', 9: '1'. So (7,9) is '.' empty. (8,9) is '0', (9,9) is '1'. No apple there.\n\nApples listed: (2,9) is an apple? Check list: (2,9) is in the apple drops. Yes! (2,9) is an apple. That's at x=2, y=9. That's far left on the top row. We could go LEFT towards (2,9). But we have enemy at (8,9). If we go LEFT to (8,9), we're heading toward that apple but through enemy territory.\n\nAlternative: Go DOWN? But (9,8) is our own body, so DEAD. So only LEFT is safe? But LEFT is moving into the enemy's current head position. Simultaneous move: If they move UP to (9,9), we go LEFT to (8,9) - fine. If they move LEFT to (7,9), we go to (8,9) - fine. If they move DOWN to (8,8), we go to (8,9) - fine. If they move RIGHT to (9,9), we go to (8,9) - fine. So no collision.\n\nBut is there a safer move? UP is off board. RIGHT is off board. DOWN is into our own body. So LEFT is the only possible safe move? Wait, what about moving to (9,8) is our own body, so DEAD. Yes, LEFT is the only move that doesn't kill us immediately.\n\nBut hold on: The rule says \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" (8,9) is enemy head, not body. Body is the segments behind. So moving into enemy head's current position is not moving into their body; it's moving into the cell where their head currently is. But since they move simultaneously, that cell will be empty after they move (unless they stay, but they must move). So it should be safe.\n\nBut there's a catch: If they move into the same cell we're moving into? We're both moving into (8,9)? No, we're moving into (8,9) from (9,9). They are at (8,9) and moving somewhere else. So we end at (8,9), they end somewhere else. No shared cell.\n\nIf they move into (9,9) (our current head), we end at (8,9), they at (9,9). No collision.\n\nIf they move into (8,9) from another direction? They are already at (8,9); they can't move into it again. They must move away.\n\nSo LEFT seems safe.\n\n**However, let's double-check the board state from the description:**\nBoard:\n```\n9 . . A . . A . . 0 1\n```\nThis is row y=9. Columns x=0 to 9: 0:'.', 1:'.', 2:'A', 3:'.', 4:'.', 5:'A', 6:'.', 7:'.', 8:'0', 9:'1'\nSo at (8,9): '0' (enemy head). At (9,9): '1' (our head). \nNo apple at (8,9) or (9,9). Apple at (2,9) and (5,9).\n\n**Long-term plan:** We need to get that apple at (2,9) or others. But we have enemy blocking direct path? Enemy is at (8,9). If we go LEFT to (8,9), next turn we can go LEFT again to (7,9), etc., towards (2,9). But enemy might also go LEFT, chasing the same apple. Since we're tied, if we both go for apple, we might collide head-on. But if we get there first, we grow, get lead, then we can force aggression.\n\nBut maybe there's an apple closer? Look at (9,2)? Not listed. (7,3) is an apple, but that's far. (6,1) etc. Not immediate.\n\nFrom (9,9), moving LEFT to (8,9) gives us a path to top row apples. The enemy is also on top row. This is a race for the apple lead.\n\n**Aggression:** We should go for the apple! Even though we're tied, if we get an apple and they don't, we get lead and can force head-on later.\n\nBut is there a risk of immediate collision? Let's simulate enemy moves. Enemy at (8,9). Possible moves: UP (9,9) - but (9,9) is our current head? If they go UP to (9,9) and we go LEFT to (8,9), we swap spots. Safe. DOWN to (8,8) - that's their own body? Check enemy body: (8,8), (8,7), (8,6). So (8,8) is their own neck! If they move DOWN to (8,8), that's moving into their own body, so they would die! That's good for us. LEFT to (7,9) - possible. RIGHT to (9,9) - we already considered.\n\nSo if enemy moves DOWN, they die. If they move UP, we swap. If they move LEFT, we both go left, ending at (8,9) and (7,9). Safe.\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT move:**\n- Not off board.\n- Not into our own body (8,9 is not in our body list: (9,8),(9,7),(9,6)).\n- Not into enemy body (enemy body is (8,8),(8,7),(8,6) - not (8,9)).\n- Not into enemy head? Enemy head is at (8,9) but they are moving. As long as they don't move into (8,9) after we move, but they can't stay. So it's safe.\n\n**Is there any other safe move?** No, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all dead or off-board. So LEFT is the only choice.\n\n**But wait, what about moving to (9,8) is our own body, so DOWN is dead. Yes. So LEFT is the only viable move.**\n\n**Decision:** We must move LEFT to stay alive. Even though it's aggressive and we're tied, we have no other option. We'll aim for the apple at (2,9) and grow. If enemy blocks, we'll reassess. For now, survive and grow.\n\n**Final Move:** LEFT\n\n**Short-term plan:** From (8,9), next turn consider moving LEFT again to (7,9) towards apple (2,9). Watch enemy move. If they go for the same apple, we might need to divert or race. But we need that apple lead! Let's go! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",
