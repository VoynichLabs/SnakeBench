Moving right keeps me progressing toward these targets.\n\n**Long-term plan for future turns:**\nStart by moving right to reach the apple cluster on the right side of the board (particularly targeting (6, 7) first as it's accessible).

This starts positioning me toward the middle/bottom apples but keeps me on the edge where I might get trapped.\n\n- **RIGHT** (to 2, 9): Continues moving right along the top edge toward the cluster of apples at (6, 7), (7, 5), (8, 5), and (4, 5). This is more strategically sound as it moves me toward the densest apple region.\n\nRIGHT keeps more options open and moves me toward the apple cluster on the right side of the board. The enemy is behind me to the left, so moving right increases distance and safety.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nContinue moving right along the top of the board to reach the apple cluster. Target (6, 7) first as it's the most accessible apple on the right side. Build length advantage early. Monitor enemy snake's position to avoid collisions, particularly on the right side where apples are concentrated.\n\nRIGHT",
