No snake bodies or apples on (7,8).\n- Cons: Edges can limit future movement; apples not closer in this direction.\n\n### RIGHT (to 8,7)\n- Pros: Gets me closer to (8,4), one of the closest apples (just need to go RIGHT then DOWN x3).\n- Cons: None significant; board edge at x=9 is still one square away.\n\n### LEFT (to 6,7)\n- Pros: Would move toward (4,3) apple, but much further away than (8,4).\n- Cons: Further from closest apple.\n\n### DOWN (to 7,6)\n- My tail occupies (7,6), so if we just grew this tile is blocked (classic Snake behavior). Moving down is illegal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**RIGHT (to 8,7) is the best move**\n- Safest, directs me toward the nearest apple.\n- Leaves me options (can go DOWN after this and continue toward (8,4)).\n- No snakes near.\n\n## Next-Turn Strategy\nAfter stepping to (8,7), see if apple (8,4) remains available.

Potentially going up, left, or staying in place.)\n- **Apples:** (5,0), (1,8), (2,0), (4,3), (2,2)\n\n## Adjacency & Safety\n**Possible moves from (8,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,7):  \n    - My tail. Safe only because the tail is moving up after my head moves down (since I didn\u2019t grow last step).  \n    - So this IS safe this turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5):  \n    - Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6):  \n    - Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6):  \n    - Empty (edge of the board at x=9), safe.\n\n## Mid-, Short-, and Long-term Apple Targets\n\n- **Closest apple, direct path:**  \n    - (4,3): LEFT+DOWN, but the enemy could cut me off if I go straight left/down now.\n    - (5,0): All the way down, then a left; minimal risk of enemy, but long path.\n    - (2,2) and (2,0): Further out.\n    - (1,8): Top left corner, not worth pursuing now.\n\n## Enemy behavior\n- Enemy at (8,4), body at (7,4), (6,4).\n- If enemy goes UP this turn, it will be at (8,5) next turn, one below me; a potential collision zone if I also go DOWN now.\n- If enemy goes LEFT, it could be moving towards (4,3).\n- If enemy goes RIGHT or stays, less threat in my direct path.\n\n## Move-by-move analysis\n\n### 1. DOWN (to 8,5)\n- Pros:\n    - Popular classic choice; safe, keeps threat below me.\n    - Doesn't block own escape route.\n    - Opens flexibility for next move to go left, right, or down.\n- Cons:\n    - If enemy moves UP, we are stacked in the same column one row apart; possible head-on next turn.\n\n### 2. LEFT (to 7,6)\n- Pros:\n    - Opens up path towards (4,3) apple, possibly beating enemy if they head left more slowly.\n    - Gets off same vertical as enemy (safe from direct vertical conflict).\n- Cons:\n    - If enemy is also going left, can converge rapidly, leading to a possible collision in the next few turns as we both swing towards center-left.\n\n### 3. UP (to 8,7)\n- Pros:\n    - Doubles back onto own tail, which is safe if not eating.\n    - Clears enemy's horizontal entirely, minimizing chance of immediate engagement/collision.\n    - Gives visibility and timing for enemy movement before committing towards lower apples.\n- Cons:\n    - Stall: doesn't approach any apples; wastes a move in growth race.\n    - If enemy swings hard for left apples, I lose positional advantage.\n\n### 4. RIGHT (to 9,6)\n- Pros:\n    - Safe, avoids everything; gives complete info about enemy's next direction before action.\n    - No apple risk at all.\n- Cons:\n    - Crowds self against right wall; not efficient for winning.\n\n## Strategic thoughts\nMy instinct:  \nLEFT and DOWN are both safe, but LEFT brings me closer to contesting (4,3), possibly with the enemy. DOWN keeps options open (can swing left or keep going down), but has slight risk if enemy moves up toward me. UP is \"ultra-safe\", stalling for intel, but not competitive for apples.\n\n**To avoid direct contest and collisions, prefer moves that keep flexibility and maximize future apple options while minimizing immediate conflict.**\n\n## Decision\nTo maximize flexibility and keep my options open while moving toward apples, **DOWN (to 8,5)** is safe and sound. If enemy moves UP, we're not colliding yet (he'll be at (8,5) if so, but as long as we don't both go DOWN into (8,4), it's fine). Otherwise, I can re-evaluate next turn based on their path.\n\n**Self-strategy for next turn:**  \n- If enemy goes LEFT, I can contest (4,3) or bail toward (5,0).\n- If enemy goes UP, consider swinging LEFT then DOWN to avoid direct conflict.\n- Keep scanning enemy intent; avoid head-on unless advantageous.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: DOWN**"

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the board and moves again:\n\n## Current positions\n- **My head:** (8,6)  \n- **My body:** [(8,7)]  \n  (I am two segments long. My tail is at (8,7) and will move to where my head currently is, (8,6), unless I grow.)\n- **Enemy head:** (8,4)  \n- **Enemy body:** [(7,4), (6,4)]  \n  (Three segments. Potentially going up, left, or staying in place.)\n- **Apples:** (5,0), (1,8), (2,0), (4,3), (2,2)\n\n## Adjacency & Safety\n**Possible moves from (8,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,7):  \n    - My tail. Safe only because the tail is moving up after my head moves down (since I didn\u2019t grow last step).  \n    - So this IS safe this turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5):  \n    - Empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6):  \n    - Empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6):  \n    - Empty (edge of the board at x=9), safe.\n\n## Mid-, Short-, and Long-term Apple Targets\n\n- **Closest apple, direct path:**  \n    - (4,3): LEFT+DOWN, but the enemy could cut me off if I go straight left/down now.\n    - (5,0): All the way down, then a left; minimal risk of enemy, but long path.\n    - (2,2) and (2,0): Further out.\n    - (1,8): Top left corner, not worth pursuing now.\n\n## Enemy behavior\n- Enemy at (8,4), body at (7,4), (6,4).\n- If enemy goes UP this turn, it will be at (8,5) next turn, one below me; a potential collision zone if I also go DOWN now.\n- If enemy goes LEFT, it could be moving towards (4,3).\n- If enemy goes RIGHT or stays, less threat in my direct path.\n\n## Move-by-move analysis\n\n### 1. DOWN (to 8,5)\n- Pros:\n    - Popular classic choice; safe, keeps threat below me.\n    - Doesn't block own escape route.\n    - Opens flexibility for next move to go left, right, or down.\n- Cons:\n    - If enemy moves UP, we are stacked in the same column one row apart; possible head-on next turn.\n\n### 2. LEFT (to 7,6)\n- Pros:\n    - Opens up path towards (4,3) apple, possibly beating enemy if they head left more slowly.\n    - Gets off same vertical as enemy (safe from direct vertical conflict).\n- Cons:\n    - If enemy is also going left, can converge rapidly, leading to a possible collision in the next few turns as we both swing towards center-left.\n\n### 3. UP (to 8,7)\n- Pros:\n    - Doubles back onto own tail, which is safe if not eating.\n    - Clears enemy's horizontal entirely, minimizing chance of immediate engagement/collision.\n    - Gives visibility and timing for enemy movement before committing towards lower apples.\n- Cons:\n    - Stall: doesn't approach any apples; wastes a move in growth race.\n    - If enemy swings hard for left apples, I lose positional advantage.\n\n### 4. RIGHT (to 9,6)\n- Pros:\n    - Safe, avoids everything; gives complete info about enemy's next direction before action.\n    - No apple risk at all.\n- Cons:\n    - Crowds self against right wall; not efficient for winning.\n\n## Strategic thoughts\nMy instinct:  \nLEFT and DOWN are both safe, but LEFT brings me closer to contesting (4,3), possibly with the enemy. DOWN keeps options open (can swing left or keep going down), but has slight risk if enemy moves up toward me. UP is \"ultra-safe\", stalling for intel, but not competitive for apples.\n\n**To avoid direct contest and collisions, prefer moves that keep flexibility and maximize future apple options while minimizing immediate conflict.**\n\n## Decision\nTo maximize flexibility and keep my options open while moving toward apples, **DOWN (to 8,5)** is safe and sound. If enemy moves UP, we're not colliding yet (he'll be at (8,5) if so, but as long as we don't both go DOWN into (8,4), it's fine). Otherwise, I can re-evaluate next turn based on their path.\n\n**Self-strategy for next turn:**  \n- If enemy goes LEFT, I can contest (4,3) or bail toward (5,0).\n- If enemy goes UP, consider swinging LEFT then DOWN to avoid direct conflict.\n- Keep scanning enemy intent; avoid head-on unless advantageous.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: DOWN**"

Heading LEFT is both safe and moves us straight toward it.\n\nNext-turn strategy: once we reach x=4 at y=3, pivot south to collect the apples at (2,2) and (2,0), then swing back northeast for the remaining apples.\n\nDecided move: LEFT"
