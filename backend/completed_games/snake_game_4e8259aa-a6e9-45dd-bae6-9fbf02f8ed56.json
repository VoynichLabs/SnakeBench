It can't move right, because the body is also in a position to prevent that, diagonally right to the head. Down doesn't seem like a good idea, because the body is right below. What about up?\nThere aren't any apples in sight, but all dangers aren't here. The left will just make the snake loop to the other end of the screen. The enemy will not be a threat yet.\nI need to check the snake's known speed. It seems that this snake can move faster than others.\n\nDataProvider error: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit exceeded: a11y-experiments.
