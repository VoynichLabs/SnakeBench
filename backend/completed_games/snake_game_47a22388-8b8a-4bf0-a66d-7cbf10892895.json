This is the most direct and efficient path.\n\nThe other apples are:\n- (5, 9) - Further away and closer to enemy territory\n- (6, 0) - Very far away\n- (5, 7) - About 2-3 moves away but (3, 8) is closer\n- (1, 5) - About 3 moves away\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue UP to (3, 8) to collect the apple. After that, evaluate which apple to target next - likely either (5, 7) or (1, 5) depending on the enemy snake's position.\n\nUP"

Looking at the board, I can see my snake body is at [(1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)] and I should have grown by one segment due to eating the apple.\n\nFrom position (0, 7), let me check my available moves:\n- UP: Would go to (0, 8) - This looks clear on the board\n- DOWN: Would go to (0, 6) - This looks clear on the board  \n- LEFT: Would go to (-1, 7) - This is outside the board boundaries, DEATH\n- RIGHT: Would go to (1, 7) - This is where my body segment is now, DEATH\n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT are both deadly moves. I need to choose between UP and DOWN.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n- (1, 5) - This is relatively close\n- (6, 0), (7, 0) - These are far away in the bottom right\n- (6, 9) - This is far away in the top right\n- (5, 1) - This is also distant\n\nThe enemy snake head is at (2, 5) with a long body. If I want to go for the apple at (1, 5), I need to be careful about the enemy snake's position.\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 8), I'll be moving away from most apples temporarily but might have more maneuvering room.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 6), I'll be getting closer to the apple at (1, 5), and I can potentially approach it from the left side.\n\nI think DOWN is the better strategic choice here - it gets me closer to the nearest apple at (1, 5) and gives me a good approach angle.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (0, 6), continue moving toward the apple at (1, 5). I can move DOWN again to (0, 5) and then RIGHT to (1, 5) to grab it, assuming the enemy snake doesn't interfere.\n\nDOWN"

However, since the game is still asking for a move, there must be something I'm missing or the game state allows for one of these moves.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe the enemy snake moved and freed up a space? Looking at their head position at (0, 4), they might have moved their tail, potentially freeing up the space at (3, 6) or (2, 5).\n\nGiven that I was successfully moving RIGHT in my last turn and the strategy was to continue toward the apple at (9, 6), I'll continue with RIGHT, hoping that the enemy snake's movement has cleared the path.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I survive this move, continue moving right toward the apple at (9, 6). Monitor the enemy snake's movement pattern and look for opportunities to access other apples safely.\n\nRIGHT"
