My snake length is increasing, so the tail movement adjusts accordingly.\n\nLooking at the map:\n\n- Apples remaining: (4,4), (2,0), (4,2), (3,5), (6,3)\n- I am at (5,3) now.\n- The nearest apples are (4,4) (up-left diagonally), (4,2) (left-down), (6,3) (right at same y coordinate), and (3,5) which is further away.\n\nConsidering the next turn move the plan was to go LEFT to (4,2) to get that apple. Moving LEFT from (5,3) toward (4,3) is safe.\n\nBut the (4,4) apple is also close by, just one cell up and one cell left from (5,3).\n\nDanger check: Enemy snake #0 is at (6,0) and has no body. So no threat near me.\n\nNo walls directly in the way.\n\nOne concern: Avoid moving backwards into my own body at (5,2). Since my body is there, but since (5,2) is behind me, I shouldn't move DOWN immediately -- that would be suicide.\n\nSo current plan to go LEFT next turn is valid.\n\nThis turn, I see that moving LEFT would get closer to (4,2).\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (5,4) may get closer to (4,4) or (3,5).\n\nBut (5,4) is empty and safe.\n\nI will move LEFT this turn as per the plan to get the apple at (4,2) next turn.\n\nDecided move: LEFT\n\nStrategy for next turns: After collecting (4,2), move UP to (4,4), then to (3,5), then consider going towards (6,3).

RIGHT to (6, 4) - Safe, but doesn't get me closer to any apples\n\nI need to be careful about the enemy snake. They're at (3, 4) and could potentially move RIGHT to (4, 4) to grab that apple. However, I'm closer to it than they are.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the apple at (4, 4) - I can grab it in one move by going LEFT, while the enemy snake is currently at (3, 4). If they try to contest it, we'd both be going for the same square, but I should be able to get it since I'm making the move.\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is the closest and most valuable target right now. Going UP toward (5, 6) is safer but less rewarding.\n\nI think I should go for the apple at (4, 4) by moving LEFT. It's aggressive but should pay off.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After grabbing the apple at (4, 4), assess the enemy snake's position and either go for the apple at (3, 5) or (5, 6) depending on safety and enemy positioning.\n\nLEFT"
