Our immediate goal should be to move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snake (which is at (9, 4)) and not running into walls or ourselves.\n\n- **Possible moves from (0, 5)**:\n  - **UP (0, 6)**: This keeps us safe and allows for potential moves on the next turn.\n  - **DOWN (0, 4)**: This also keeps us safe.\n  - **LEFT (-1, 5)**: Out of bounds, which is a kill move.\n  - **RIGHT (1, 5)**: This keeps us safe and moves us into a position where we can navigate toward some apples.\n\nNext, let's evaluate what\u2019s around:\n1. If we move **UP** to (0, 6), the next possible moves could then be:\n   - DOWN (returning to (0, 5), not a good move),\n   - LEFT (out of bounds),\n   - RIGHT (to (1, 6) which has no apple nearby).\n  \n2. If we move **DOWN** to (0, 4):\n   - We could then go back up, left (out of bounds), or right to (1, 4).\n\n3. Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 5) gives greater flexibility:\n   - Next, we can then either go back left (to (0, 5), not ideal), down (to (1, 4)), or up (to (1, 6)), which might allow for further exploration.\n\nGiven that the apples are concentrated towards the right side of the board and considering the positioning of the enemy snake, moving to the right offers more options to pursue apples effectively while countering the threat from the enemy.\n\nTherefore, I should move **RIGHT** from (0, 5) to (1, 5). This opens up the possibility for the next turn to either go up to (1, 6) or down to (1, 4), while keeping my options as expansive as possible.\n\nNext move: **RIGHT**."

I also notice that Snake #1 is at (0, 5), which could be a potential threat.\n\nMy current position is at the top right corner of the board, and I have a good view of the entire board. I can see the apples and the other snakes, but I don't see any immediate threats.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to move towards the apple at (7, 6) and try to eat it. This will give me a good opportunity to grow and gain points.\n\nMy decided next move is: RIGHT."
