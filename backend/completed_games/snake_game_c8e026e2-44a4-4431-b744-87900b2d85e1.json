Since my snake is currently at (3, 5), the closest apple is the one at (3, 6). \n\nHowever, I also need to consider the position of the enemy snake, which is currently at (2, 5). If I move up to (3, 6) to get the apple, I may run into the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for this turn should be to move to the left, towards the apple at (0, 6). This will put some distance between myself and the enemy snake, while still allowing me to get an apple.\n\nTherefore, my next move is LEFT."

(2,7) - just 2 squares directly above\n2. (3,6) - diagonally up-right\n3. (0,6) - up and left\n\nStrategy:\nGoing UP seems safest and most efficient because:\n1. It moves me toward the closest apple at (2,7)\n2. It creates distance between me and the enemy snake\n3. It puts me in a position to potentially reach multiple apples\n\nFor next turn, I should continue evaluating the closest apples and enemy snake position.\n\nDirection: UP"
