Keep monitoring Snake #1's movement and adjust my path accordingly.\n2. Prioritize getting the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 2).\n3. Look for an opportunity to move down towards the apples without getting too close to Snake #1.\n\nNext move: LEFT. This move will take me to (7, 8), which is still a safe position for now.
