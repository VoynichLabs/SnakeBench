So to reach (5,1), must move down y from 3 to 1, totaling 2 down steps, while gaining x nearby. But apple at (5,1) is 3 down and 3 right \u2014 Manhattan distance 6. The apple at (6,3) is only 4 right and 0 down \u2014 closer in x and same y. And it's at (6,3), while head is at (2,3), so same row. Moving right 4 steps to (6,3) lands directly on the apple. That\u2019s efficient. Apple at (6,3) is an apple \u2014 moving directly toward it is optimal.

No other snake near that spot.  \nThus, go RIGHT.  \nStrategy: Secure the closest apple on same row to minimize moves and avoid detours.  \n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**",
