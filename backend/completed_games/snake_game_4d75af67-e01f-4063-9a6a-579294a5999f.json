Length 1.\n\nMy current available moves are:\n1. **UP**: New Head: (2, 2). Safe?\n    * Boundaries: (2, 2) is safe (0-9 range).\n    * Self-collision: Body is empty, so safe. The cell behind the head is (2, 1) if I move UP to (2, 2). Wait, since I am length 1, there is no cell behind me to worry about hitting in the traditional sense, but the rule is \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" If I move UP from (2, 1) to (2, 2), the cell behind me is (2, 1). Since I just moved *away* from (2, 1), this move cannot cause an immediate self-collision.\n    * Enemy collision: Enemy head at (0, 4). (2, 2) is safe from (0, 4) unless the enemy moves to (2, 2). We check enemy movements later. For now, (2, 2) is safe regarding the *current* enemy position.\n    * Apple: (2, 2) is not an apple.\n    * Next position (2, 2) is safe from immediate collision based on static opponent locations and boundaries.\n\n2. **DOWN**: New Head: (2, 0). Safe?\n    * Boundaries: (2, 0) is safe.\n    * Self-collision: Safe for length 1 snake.\n    * Enemy collision: (2, 0) is safe from (0, 4).\n    * Apple: (2, 0) is not an apple. (1, 0) is an apple, but (2, 0) is not.\n    * Next position (2, 0) is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT**: New Head: (1, 1). Safe?\n    * Boundaries: (1, 1) is safe.\n    * Self-collision: Safe.\n    * Enemy collision: (1, 1) is safe from (0, 4).\n    * Apple: **(1, 1) is an apple (A1)**. Eating this apple increases my length to 2.\n    * Next position (1, 1) is safe and collects an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: New Head: (3, 1). Safe?\n    * Boundaries: (3, 1) is safe.\n    * Self-collision: Safe.\n    * Enemy collision: (3, 1) is safe from (0, 4).\n    * Apple: (3, 1) is not an apple.\n    * Next position (3, 1) is safe.\n\n**Analysis of Target Apples:**\nMy head is at (2, 1).\nClosest apple is (1, 1) [Move LEFT]. Distance 1.\nNext closest is (1, 0) [Move DOWN to (2, 0), then LEFT to (1, 0)]. Distance 2 (minimum moves required).\nOther apples are further: (0, 7), (0, 8), (7, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n*   LEFT to (1, 1): Eats an apple. Length increases to 2. Body becomes: Head (1, 1), Tail (2, 1). (Wait, the body is ordered head-to-tail, so if I move from (2, 1) to (1, 1) and eat, my new snake will be: Head (1, 1), Tail (2, 1)). This is good.\n\n*   DOWN to (2, 0): Does not eat an apple. Length remains 1. Body: Head (2, 0), Tail (2, 1).\n\n*   UP to (2, 2): Does not eat an apple. Length remains 1. Body: Head (2, 2), Tail (2, 1).\n\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1): Does not eat an apple. Length remains 1. Body: Head (3, 1), Tail (2, 1).\n\n**Considering Opponent Movement (Snake #0 at (0, 4)):**\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4). The apples near it are (0, 7) and (0, 8). It is likely heading towards those or the corner.\nPossible moves for Snake #0: UP, DOWN, LEFT (death), RIGHT.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 5), it is safe.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 3), it is safe.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it is safe.\n\nDoes moving LEFT to (1, 1) clash with Snake #0's potential moves?\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 1), Snake #0 does not land on (1, 1) unless it moves (0, 4) -> (1, 1), which is an invalid move (diagonal). So, no head-on collision risk this turn, regardless of its next move.\n\n**Strategy:**\nEating an apple when possible is the primary goal, especially early in the game when length disparity is minimal, but gaining length provides safety margin and scoring advantage. Moving LEFT secures an apple and increases my length.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 0), my next goal would likely be to move LEFT to (1, 0) to get the second closest apple, which is available from (2, 0) in one step.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 1), I eat the apple, and my new head is at (1, 1). The nearest remaining apple is (1, 0). I can reach it next turn by moving DOWN, provided (1, 0) is still available and I don't clash with the enemy.\n\nMove LEFT maximizes immediate gain (apple + length) without introducing immediate danger.\n\n**Long-term plan update:** Secure the apples closest to me first: (1, 1) then (1, 0). Then assess trajectory toward the others. Given the enemy is far away in the upper left corner, focusing on adjacent territory seems safest.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**State update after move LEFT (assumed successful):**\nNew Head: (1, 1). Length 2.\nMy Snake (ID 1): Head (1, 1), Body (2, 1). Apples: 1.\nApples remaining: (1, 0), (0, 7), (0, 8), (7, 6).\n\nI must now output the enemy move calculations for Turn 1 simultaneously, but I only need to provide MY move now.\n\nLEFT",

No.\n    *   New Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1)].\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (2, 1):\n    *   Safe? **No.** Moving to (2, 1) means moving directly backwards into the cell previously occupied by the head, which is now the *tail segment* (2, 1). Wait, correction: The snake is currently Head (1, 1), Tail connected to (1, 1) is (2, 1). If I move RIGHT to (2, 1), I am moving into my own tail segment, so *this move is a self-collision and results in death*.\n\n*Self-Correction on Snake Body Interpretation for Turn 1:*\nMy snake state entering Turn 1 (based on my move choice in the previous turn, which you dictated was `LEFT` based on prior state where head was (2,1) and length 1):\nPrevious Head: (2, 1). Previous length 1.\nMove: LEFT -> New Head: (1, 1). Apple Eaten: (1, 1).\nNew Length: 2.\nNew Body (Head to Tail): Head (1, 1), connected to Tail (2, 1). *The body list provided in the prompt (Body: [(2, 1)]) implies the head moved from (2,1) to (1,1) and ate, resulting in a body segment at the previous head location (2,1).*\n\nLet's confirm this derived state against the provided input for Turn 1:\nTurn: 1 / 150\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (1, 1), Body: [(2, 1)], Apples collected: 1. (Length 2).\nIf the head is (1, 1) and the body segment is (2, 1), then my snake occupies cells (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n\nRe-evaluating Moves from Head (1, 1), Occupied Cells: (1, 1), (2, 1). Tail End is (2, 1).\n\n1.  **UP** to (1, 2): Safe from (2, 1).\n2.  **DOWN** to (1, 0): Safe from (2, 1). **EATS APPLE (1, 0).**\n3.  **LEFT** to (0, 1): Safe from (2, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT** to (2, 1): **Collision.** Moving into (2, 1) which is my body segment. **DEAD.**\n\n**Evaluating Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at (0, 5)):**\nEnemy options: UP (0, 6), DOWN (0, 4), RIGHT (1, 5). All safe paths for the enemy.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 0) and gain length, I am making a definite positive move. The enemy is far enough away that a head-on collision this turn is impossible, and they are not threatening my immediate path to (1, 0).\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove DOWN secures the second closest apple ((1, 0)) immediately following the apple eaten last turn. This increases length to 3 and score to 2, establishing a decent early lead structure. This move is clearly safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turn 1):** Secure (1, 0) via **DOWN**. Next, eyes on (0, 7) and (0, 8) if Snake #0 drifts away from them, or potentially (3, 7) if Snake #0 shows no interest there. Since (1, 0) is located near the bottom edge, moving there keeps me mostly out of the way of Snake #0 operating in the upper-left quadrant for now.\n\n**Chosen Move:** DOWN\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nStrategy: Continue aggressive apple collection while maintaining separation from Snake #0. Since I secure (1, 0) by moving DOWN, my new head will be (1, 0), and my body will be [(2, 1), (1, 1)] (body list order reversed after eating: Tail (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> New Head (1, 0)).\nNext targets are the upper left apples: (0, 7), (0, 8). After consuming (1, 0), I am at (1, 0). I will likely need an UP move next to approach the left wall targets (0, 7/8), or use the wall at Y=0 to maneuver toward X=0. Snake #0 is currently stationary or moving near (0, 5). I need to see where it goes this turn before committing to the upper left corner aggressively.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nDOWN",

This is a safe move, allowing me to ascend the left wall towards the apples soon.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 7), they score. If I move LEFT, I position myself to try and cut them off or pursue the remaining apples (3, 7) or (7, 6)/(7, 3). Given that the pathfinding to (0, 7) is now becoming contested, positioning myself on the wall (0, 0) seems proactive for the long game focusing on the left cluster.\n\nChoosing **LEFT** to secure position (0, 0) for upward movement towards the densely packed apples in the upper left corner.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMy primary goal is to reach apples (0, 7) and (0, 8) before Snake #0 claims them both. Since my current position at (1, 0) prevents immediate ascent (hitting my own body at (1, 1)), I must move to the side. LEFT to (0, 0) is the best preparatory move, allowing me to move UP next turn to (0, 1) and start climbing the wall. I need to monitor if Snake #0 eats at (0, 7) or attempts to move defensively around my ascent lane. If Snake #0 eats at (0, 7), I will focus on (0, 8) or pivot to the lower right apples (3, 7 / 7, 6).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The cell directly behind the head is (1, 0). Moving back to (1, 0) results in self-collision if I was longer than 2, but here (1, 0) is my body segment, so moving RIGHT to (1, 0) is **DEAD**. Wait, let's reconfirm the self-collision rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy body is [(1, 0), (1, 1)]. The cell behind (0, 0) is (1, 0).\n1.  **UP** to (0, 1):\n    *   Safe? Yes. Does not hit (1, 0) or (1, 1).\n    *   Apple? No.\n    *   This moves me directly towards (0, 8). This is the planned progression.\n2.  **DOWN** to (0, -1): **Off Board.** **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT** to (-1, 0): **Off Board.** **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT** to (1, 0): **Collision.** Hits my body segment (1, 0). **DEAD.**\n\nSince UP is the only safe move, it must be chosen, unless Snake #0 is moving into (0, 1).\n\n**Evaluating Enemy Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (0, 7)):**\nSnake #0 likely wants (0, 8) next, as it is adjacent.\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  UP to (0, 8) [Eats Apple].\n2.  DOWN to (0, 6) [Moves back to body segment, this is where the head was last turn, but now (0, 6) is its body segment]. Safe move.\n3.  RIGHT to (1, 7). Safe move.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 8), they gain another apple, and my pursuit path towards that cluster is blocked/delayed.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (1, 7), they leave (0, 8) open for me briefly.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 6), they leave (0, 8) open for me, but they are heading towards my current position vertically.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI only have one safe move: UP to (0, 1). I must take it, regardless of Snake #0's likely move to (0, 8), because suicide moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are eliminated. If Snake #0 takes (0, 8), my strategy shifts to pursuing the next closest apple, (3, 7) or (2, 3). Moving UP ensures I maintain vertical momentum towards that region.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Update:**\nThe primary goal on the left side is now compromised since Snake #0 likely consumed (0, 8) this turn (by moving UP). My move UP to (0, 1) establishes my ascent route. After this mandatory move, I will continue UP towards (0, 9) if possible, aiming to circle around or maintain pressure on the top edge, while monitoring when Snake #0 might attempt to move away from the wall or if I can cut them off near (0, 9) or (1, 8). If I cannot reach any apples soon, I will pivot towards the cluster in the middle/bottom (3, 7) or (2, 3).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nExecute the only safe move: UP to (0, 1). Continue moving UP towards (0, 9) to maximize presence near the apple cluster. If Snake #0 stays near the corner, I may try to use my length advantage (3 vs 2) later to trap them once I get higher, or pivot towards the right side apples ((3, 7), (7, 6), (7, 3), (2, 3)) if the left side proves too tightly contested or I cannot find an immediate apple.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nUP",

Moves away from the wall towards the center.\n\nSafe moves: UP (0, 2) and RIGHT (1, 1).\n\n**Target Evaluation:**\nClosest apples: (2, 3), (3, 7). (7, 6), (7, 3), (9, 7) are much further across the board.\n(2, 3) is closer than (3, 7) in terms of Chebyshev distance from (0, 1) if we go around the wall.\n\nPath to (2, 3) from (0, 1):\nIf UP to (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) [4 moves] - assuming no obstacles.\n\nPath to (3, 7) from (0, 1): Requires crossing the board entirely.\n\nSnake #0 at (0, 8) is likely going to stay high or move right/down and might challenge (9, 7) or circle back towards the center.\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n*   **UP to (0, 2):** Keeps me vertically aligned near the left edge, aiming for the top edge or perhaps circling around to the center-left apples like (2, 3). It keeps my snake stretched along the left edge.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Moves me towards the center mass of remaining apples [(2, 3), (3, 7)]. This seems strategically better as the upper left corner is now dominated by Snake #0.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 1):\nMy snake occupies [(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]. The tail end is (1, 0) which now moves to (1, 1) to become the new body segment. Wait, my body definition is Head:[0,1], Body:[(0,0), (1,0)]. If I move RIGHT to (1, 1), my new body will be [(0, 1), (0, 0)]. The old tail (1, 0) is dropped.\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\nNew Head: (1, 1). New Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]. (Tail (1, 0) is dropped). This is a safe and flexible move towards the center.\n\nIf I move UP:\nNew Head: (0, 2). New Body: [(0, 1), (0, 0)]. (Tail (1, 0) is dropped). This keeps me pinned against the wall.\n\nSince the direct path confrontation on the left side is over for this turn cycle (Snake #0 having eaten the highest apple), moving towards the central apple cluster {(2, 3), (3, 7)} via RIGHT seems more advantageous than staying stuck on the edge wall.\n\nSnake #0's likely move: If they move DOWN to (0, 7) or RIGHT to (1, 8), they are moving away from my area of interest (center).\n\nI choose **RIGHT** to start navigating towards (2, 3).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove right towards the center/bottom left apples: (2, 3) and (3, 7). Snake #0 is currently secure on the top edge. My next move after this one will likely be UP or RIGHT again, depending on where (1, 1) leads me relative to (2, 3). I aim to reach (2, 3) in 3-4 more moves.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nRIGHT\n\n---\n(Self-Correction check on body update for RIGHT move: My previous body was [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)]. If I move RIGHT to (1, 1), the new body sequence is Head (1, 1) -> Previous Head (0, 1) -> Previous Body Segment 1 (0, 0). The old tail (1, 0) is removed. This confirms the move progression is safe and reduces curvature slightly by moving away from the wall.)\nRIGHT",

(0, 0) is safe as it's part of the body, but Down moves into (1, 0) which is currently vacant and was the tail position in the previous state, but the old tail was (1, 0). Let's reconfirm body structure after moving RIGHT from (0, 1) to (1, 1).\n    Previous state T4: Head (0, 1), Body [(0, 0), (1, 0)].\n    Move RIGHT to (1, 1).\n    New state T5: Head (1, 1), Body [(0, 1), (0, 0)]. (Tail (1, 0) is dropped).\n    The cell directly behind (1, 1) is (0, 1). Moving to (0, 1) is **Collision** with my body. **DEAD.**\n    *Correction*: The cell directly behind the head (1, 1) is (0, 1) if moving LEFT. If moving DOWN, the cell is (1, 0).\n    Let's check against the current body: {(1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)}.\n    *   DOWN to (1, 0): Safe.\n    *   UP to (1, 2): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (0, 1): **Collision** with body. **DEAD.**\n    *   RIGHT to (2, 1): Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP (1, 2), DOWN (1, 0), RIGHT (2, 1).\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Position:** Head at (1, 8). Body {(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7)}. Snake #0 is very high up. It is unlikely to interfere immediately with my path towards (2, 3) or (3, 7).\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n*   **DOWN to (1, 0):** Moves me back to the bottom edge, reversing the progress made last turn. Not optimal unless Snake #0 is threatening to corner me high up, which it isn't.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Moves me closer to the central area and the apple (2, 3). This seems like the best continuation of the prior plan.\n*   **UP to (1, 2):** Keeps me vertical. It's 1 unit closer to (2, 3) in Y, but RIGHT gets me 1 unit closer in X, which is often more crucial for crossing the board.\n\nMoving RIGHT to **(2, 1)** seems most direct towards the closest low apple (2, 3).\n\n**Path to (2, 3) from (2, 1):**\n(2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) (2 moves if the path is clear).\n\nIf I move (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3), I reach the apple on Turn 7. This is a fast approach.\n\n**Snake #0 Prediction:** Snake #0 is at (1, 8). If it moves DOWN into (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 8), it stays away from my approach path towards the lower half of the board. It's unlikely to cause immediate conflict.\n\n**Decision:** Continue moving towards the center/lower left apples via RIGHT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nContinue closing the distance towards apple (2, 3). If I successfully move to (2, 1) and then (2, 2), I will attempt to consume (2, 3) on Turn 7. I need to monitor Snake #0, but for now, focus on the closest reward.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Where could it move?\nSafe moves for Snake #0 (Head at (1, 7), Body {(1, 8), (0, 8)}):\n*   UP to (1, 8): Collision with body segment (1, 8). **DEAD.**\n*   DOWN to (1, 6): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (0, 7): Safe (if (0, 7) doesn't belong to its body, which it doesn't seem to).\n*   RIGHT to (2, 7): Safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 6), it moves slightly closer to our target region, but it's still far from (2, 1)/(2, 2). If it moves RIGHT to (2, 7), it moves further away from us horizontally. There is no immediate threat of collision with our path towards (2, 3) by moving UP.\n\nPlaying UP maximizes the chance of reaching the closest available apple (2, 3) quickly.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nThe immediate goal is to consume Apple A4 at (2, 3) this turn or the next. Moving UP to (2, 2) (Head at (2, 1) -> (2, 2)) guarantees eating A4 on Turn 7 if Snake #0 does not move to (2, 3) itself (which is unlikely given its high position unless it moves DOWN far very quickly). If A4 is eaten, we reassess for A2 (3, 7) or A3 (7, 3). We must ensure Snake #0 doesn't reach our path or trap us. Continue aggressive move towards the nearest reward (2, 3).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n---\n**Turn 7 Analysis**\n\nYour Head is now at (2, 2). Your Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. Apples: 2.\nTarget Goal: Eat A4 at (2, 3).\n\n**Your Potential Moves from (2, 2):**\nOccupied cells: {(2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)}.\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** This is A4! This move eats the apple and you score 3 points.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** Collision with body segment (2, 1). **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP (2, 3) [EAT], LEFT (1, 2), RIGHT (3, 2).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #0):**\nSnake #0's previous head was at (1, 7). We need to know where it moved on Turn 7 based on its rationale from Turn 6. Since the rationale from Turn 6 specified the UP move, and we used that result to calculate the board state, we must determine where Snake #0's head moved *to reach* the current state (Head: (2, 7), Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8)]).\n\n*   Previous state (Turn 6 assumption): Head (1, 7), Body [(1, 8), (0, 8)].\n*   Current state (Turn 7 start): Head (2, 7), Body [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. (Oops, the board state provided shows the *result* of Turn 6's moves, it does not explicitly state what Snake #0 did on Turn 6 to get there, because the opponent's move is usually determined *after* we choose ours for the next turn, or the board shows the state *after* both moves were executed. Given the prompt structure, the board state shown is the state *after* your move in Turn 6 executes, and *before* you choose your move for Turn 7.)\n\nLet's re-examine the board state transition implied by the provided data:\n1.  **Start Turn 6:** Your Head (2, 1). Snake #0 Head (1, 7).\n2.  **Last Move Pick (Turn 6):** UP (You moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)).\n3.  **Board State Provided for Turn 7:**\n    Your Head: (2, 2). Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. (Matches if your UP move was executed).\n    Snake #0 Head: (2, 7). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. (This implies Snake #0 moved from somewhere to (2, 7)).\n\nIf Snake #0 was at (1, 7) and moved to (2, 7), its move was **RIGHT**.\nSnake #0 Occupied cells: {(2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8)}.\n\n**Collision Check for Your Move (Turn 7):** Head at (2, 2) moving to target (X, Y).\nYour potential moves: (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2).\n\n1.  **Move UP to (2, 3) (Eat A4):** Safe from Snake #0 (Head at (2, 7)). No collision with Snake #0 body {(1, 7), (1, 8)}.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (1, 2):** Safe from Snake #0. No collision with Snake #0 body.\n3.  **Move RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe from Snake #0. No collision with Snake #0 body.\n\n**Snake #0 Movement Prediction (Turn 8):**\nSnake #0 just moved RIGHT to (2, 7). Safe moves from (2, 7) (Body {(1, 7), (1, 8)}):\n*   UP (2, 8): Safe.\n*   DOWN (2, 6): Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 7): Collision with body segment (1, 7). **DEAD.** (Wait, body segments shift. If it was at (1, 7) on T6, and that segment shifted to (2, 7)'s tail segment, then (1, 7) is the position of body segment 2. If it moves LEFT to (1, 7), it hits its own body.)\n    *Let's confirm Snake #0's body indexing: Head: (2, 7). Body: [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. So (1, 7) is the segment directly behind the head. Moving LEFT to (1, 7) is a self-collision. **DEAD.**\n*   RIGHT (3, 7): This hits A2. Safe otherwise.\n\nSnake #0's safest moves appear to be DOWN (2, 6) or UP (2, 8). (3, 7) is also safe regarding self-collision, but targets A2.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe best move is unequivocally **UP to (2, 3)**, consuming Apple A4. This secures points, grows the snake, and moves us closer to the main cluster of remaining apples/enemy presence (around Y=7). Growing here also makes subsequent moves safer as we occupy more space.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN (Turn 8 onwards):**\nGoal: Secure A2 (3, 7) or A5 (9, 7) next, depending on Snake #0's positioning, or A3 (7, 3). We are now at (2, 3) with body [(2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)]. We have a stable vertical structure. Snake #0 is at (2, 7). We are well positioned to move towards the top half of the board without immediate conflicts. Aim for (3, 7) if Snake #0 moves away from it. If Snake #0 moves towards (3, 7) (A2), we might pivot towards A1 (7, 6) or A3 (7, 3). Consuming the nearest apple first is the priority.\n\nUP",

This means Snake #0 moved DOWN from (2, 7) on Turn 7, consuming A1=(7,6)? No, the board shows A at (7,6), (3,7), (7,3), (9,7), (6,8). Let's re-verify Snake #0's previous move based on the *current* board state.)\n\nFrom Turn 7 Rationale: Snake #0 Head was (2, 7), Body [(1, 7), (1, 8)].\nFor Turn 8 to start with Snake #0 Head at (2, 6) and Body [(2, 7), (1, 7)]:\nSnake #0 must have moved **DOWN** from (2, 7). The segment that was at (1, 7) moved to (2, 7). The segment that was at (1, 8) moved to (1, 7). This transition is consistent with a **DOWN** move for Snake #0 on Turn 7.\n\nApples remaining: A1(7, 6), A2(3, 7), A3(7, 3), A5(9, 7), A6(6, 8).\n\n**Your Potential Moves from (2, 3):**\nOccupied set: {(2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)}.\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Collision with body segment (2, 2). **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Safe.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP (2, 4), LEFT (1, 3), RIGHT (3, 3).\n\n**Enemy Future Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 6)):**\nSnake #0 is near the center/top/middle.\nSafe moves from (2, 6) (Body {(2, 7), (1, 7)}):\n*   UP (2, 7): Hits body segment (2, 7). **DEAD.** (Cannot move into its own previous head position if it's still in the body).\n*   DOWN (2, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 6): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (3, 6): Safe. (Aims towards A1 (7, 6)).\n\nSnake #0's safest moves are DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), or RIGHT (3, 6). They are far from us (distance 3 vertically). No immediate collision concern.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe are currently on the left side. The remaining good apple targets are A2 (3, 7) and A6 (6, 8), or A1 (7, 6).\nA2 (3, 7) is 1 cell right and 4 cells up.\nA6 (6, 8) is 4 cells right and 5 cells up.\nA3 (7, 3) is far right, same height.\n\nMoving towards A2 (3, 7) seems like the next natural objective, as A2 is close to the vertical line of sight of our current body structure.\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (3, 3)**: We are now aligned on X=3. Next move UP to (3, 4), then aiming at A2 (3, 7). This seems like a strong pathing towards A2.\n*   If we move **UP to (2, 4)**: Maintains vertical ascent, but keeps us far from the X=3/X=4 region where most apples are clustered.\n*   If we move **LEFT to (1, 3)**: Moves away from the action for now.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 3) positions us well to challenge A2 on Turn 9 or 10.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (Turn 8 onwards):**\nPrimary goal is collecting A2 (3, 7). Current position (2, 3). Move RIGHT to (3, 3) sets up a clean path (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7). Snake #0 is high and unlikely to threaten this path quickly. If Snake #0 moves towards A1 (7, 6) using (3, 6), that's fine, we prioritize A2 first as it is closer.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Moving UP to (3, 4) continues the direct path towards A2. This path is clear for at least the next 3 moves (3, 4 -> 3, 5 -> 3, 6 -> 3, 7 eats apple).\n\nSnake #0 appears to be maneuvering towards the center/upper region, possibly aiming for A6 (6, 8) or A1 (7, 6). Snake #0's move to (3, 6) would put it adjacent to A1 (7, 6). Our best chance to secure A2 before Snake #0 can intercept or block seems to be continuing the direct ascent.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 4) is the most direct progress toward the highest priority remaining apple (A2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turn 9 onwards):** Target A2 (3, 7) for the next 3 turns by continuously moving UP, utilizing the X=3 column. If Snake #0 tries to intervene by moving up towards (3, 7), we have enough space to maneuver away or possibly force a block, but for now, straight path is best.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

This move was safe.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 9 Start):**\nWe are at (3, 3). Target A2 is at (3, 7).\nSnake #0 is at (2, 6).\n\n**My Potential Moves from (3, 3):**\nOccupied set: {(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)}.\nBackwards move is to (2, 3), which is occupied (body). **Dead if move LEFT.**\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** Collision with body segment (2, 3). **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (3, 4), DOWN (3, 2), RIGHT (4, 3).\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (2, 6)):**\nBody: {(2, 7), (1, 7)}. Backwards move is to (2, 7), which is occupied (body). **Dead if move UP.**\nSafe moves calculated earlier (Turn 8 Rationale): DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6).\n\n**Collision Prediction (Turn 9 Simultaneous Move):**\nWe need to check if our safe moves (UP (3, 4), DOWN (3, 2), RIGHT (4, 3)) lead to a collision with Snake #0's potential safe moves (DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6)).\n\n1.  **If I move UP to (3, 4):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 5): Safe separation. (Path towards A2 is maintained: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)).\n    *   Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 6): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe separation.\n\n2.  **If I move DOWN to (3, 2):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 5): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 6): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe separation. (We are now below Snake #0, which is heading towards the center/right apples).\n\n3.  **If I move RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 5): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 6): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe separation.\n\n**Strategy Update:**\nThe primary goal is A2 (3, 7). Moving UP to (3, 4) continues the direct path towards A2. This path is clear for at least the next 3 moves (3, 4 -> 3, 5 -> 3, 6 -> 3, 7 eats apple).\n\nSnake #0 appears to be maneuvering towards the center/upper region, possibly aiming for A6 (6, 8) or A1 (7, 6). Snake #0's move to (3, 6) would put it adjacent to A1 (7, 6). Our best chance to secure A2 before Snake #0 can intercept or block seems to be continuing the direct ascent.\n\nMoving UP to (3, 4) is the most direct progress toward the highest priority remaining apple (A2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Turn 9 onwards):** Target A2 (3, 7) for the next 3 turns by continuously moving UP, utilizing the X=3 column. If Snake #0 tries to intervene by moving up towards (3, 7), we have enough space to maneuver away or possibly force a block, but for now, straight path is best.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis for Turn 10**\nThe previous move was UP, resulting in the snake being at (3, 4).\nYour Head: (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. Length 4 (Score 3). *Wait, the body list seems to have been truncated in the previous turn's move description for Turn 9. Let's re-establish the actual state.*\n\n**Revisiting State after Turn 9 Move (UP from (3, 3))**\nIf I moved UP from (3, 3) on Turn 9, my new head is (3, 4).\nMy previous body was [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)].\nMy new body sequence (head to tail): (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2). (Length 4, score 3). *This matches the derived state from the input board/score information.*\n\nEnemy Snake #0 (moved from (2, 6) to (3, 7) if it also chose UP, or some other safe move).\nThe board state shows: Snake #0 Head at (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Apples: 3.\n\nThis means:\n1. **My move (Turn 9):** UP from (3, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (3, 4). (Safe, no apple eaten).\n2. **Snake #0 move (Turn 9):** Snake #0 chose to move UP from (2, 6) to (3, 7) in the simultaneous move resolution, and potentially ate Apple A2 (3, 7)!\n\nWait, let's check the apple locations vs the board state:\nApples at: (7, 6) [A1], (7, 3) [A3], (9, 7) [A5], (6, 8) [A6], (4, 9) [A4].\nWhere is A2 (3, 7)? A2 is *missing* from the board representation provided for Turn 10.\nThe board shows:\nRow 7: `. . T 0 . . . . . A` (This implies Snake 0 head is at (3, 7), and an Apple A5 might be nearby if (9,7) is A5)\n\nLet's read the board state carefully for the status *after* Turn 9 move resolution.\n\n**Board State Interpretation (Turn 10 Start):**\n*   Your snake (1): Head (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. Score 3. (Matches UP move from (3, 3)).\n*   Snake #0: Head (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Score 3.\n\nIf Snake #0 is at (3, 7) and its score increased from 2 to 3, it *must* have eaten an apple.\nThe apple target A2 was (3, 7).\nIf Snake #0 successfully moved to (3, 7), it ate A2. This means my target A2 is gone.\n\n**If Snake #0 moved from (2, 6) *and* *ate* (3, 7):**\nThis implies Snake #0 moved **RIGHT** from (2, 6) to (3, 6)? No, (3, 7) is NE.\nFrom (2, 6), to reach (3, 7) is a diagonal move, which is impossible.\n\n**Revisiting Snake #0's move from (2, 6) on Turn 9:**\nSafe moves: DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6).\nIf the board state shows Head 0 at (3, 7), this is impossible unless the move rules allow diagonal movement, or the board state provided reflects an intermediate calculation or an error in recording/reading the state transition based on the previous rationale.\n\n**Assumption Check:** The board state provided at the start of Turn 10 dictates the current situation. We must base our next move on **Head (3, 4)** and **Enemy Head (3, 7)**. Snake #0 has 3 apples, meaning it ate one on Turn 9.\n\nWhich apple did Snake #0 eat?\nApples available: A1(7, 6), A2(3, 7), A3(7, 3), A5(9, 7), A6(6, 8).\nIf Snake #0 is at (3, 7), it ate A2 (3, 7).\n\nHow did Snake #0 get from (2, 6) to (3, 7)?\nIt didn't. The state implies Snake #0 must have been elsewhere before Turn 9, or the board state provided for Turn 10 reflects a move *other* than the one predicted/possible in the Turn 9 rationale.\n\n*Let's trust the current board state given for Turn 10:*\nMy Head: (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. Occupied: {(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}.\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Occupied: {(3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)}.\n\nA2 (3, 7) is gone. Snake #0 ate it. My primary target is gone/claimed.\n\n**New Priority Apples:**\nA1 (7, 6)\nA3 (7, 3)\nA5 (9, 7)\nA6 (6, 8)\nA4 (4, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is high up at (3, 7). We moved up to (3, 4). We need to decide how to proceed.\n\n**My Potential Moves from (3, 4):**\nBody: {(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}. Backwards move is (3, 3), occupied.\n1. **UP to (3, 5):** Safe. (Towards Snake #0, but far enough).\n2. **DOWN to (3, 3):** Collision with own body. **DEAD.**\n3. **LEFT to (2, 4):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (3, 5), LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4).\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (3, 7)):**\nBody: {(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)}. Backwards move is (3, 6), occupied. **Dead if move DOWN.**\nPossible safe destinations:\n1. **UP to (3, 8):** Safe.\n2. **LEFT to (2, 7):** Collision with body segment (2, 7). **DEAD.**\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe.\n\nSnake #0 Safe Moves: UP (3, 8), RIGHT (4, 7). Note: Snake #0 cannot move DOWN or LEFT safely.\n\n**Collision Prediction (Turn 10 Simultaneous Move):**\n1. **If I move UP to (3, 5):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 8): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): Safe separation.\n\n2. **If I move LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 8): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): Safe separation.\n\n3. **If I move RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 8): Safe separation.\n    *   Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): Safe separation. (If both move RIGHT, we end at (4, 4) and (4, 7) - safe).\n\n**Strategy:**\nA2 is gone. We are currently very close to Snake #0's column (X=3). Snake #0 is constrained and can only move UP or RIGHT.\nIf we move UP to (3, 5), we continue the vertical alignment, perhaps preparing to challenge Snake #0 for space, or move towards A6 (6, 8).\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 4), we move away from the center column and start heading towards the right side apples (A1 at 7, 6 or A5 at 9, 7).\n\nSince Snake #0 is currently trapped vertically (cannot retreat to X=2 or Y=6), moving UP (3, 5) keeps us close to the action path, but we are now below Snake #0 by 3 units.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 4) seems like a good directional shift to claim the right-side apples, and it moves us away from Snake #0 which has secured the center top spot currently.\n\nLet's assess distance to new targets from (4, 4) vs (3, 5):\nTarget A6 (6, 8) - Requires 2 Right, 4 Up (Total 6 moves from 4, 4).\nTarget A1 (7, 6) - Requires 3 Right, 2 Up (Total 5 moves from 4, 4).\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 5):\nTarget A6 (6, 8) - Requires 3 Right, 3 Up (Total 6 moves from 3, 5).\nTarget A1 (7, 6) - Requires 4 Right, 1 Up (Total 5 moves from 3, 5).\n\nThe move RIGHT seems slightly more centralizing towards A1/A3/A5 region than staying on X=3. Given the previous vertical focus failed to secure A2, shifting horizontally makes strategic sense.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to (4, 4).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move towards the cluster of apples A1(7, 6) and A3(7, 3) on the right side (X=7). Check if Snake #0 moves to (4, 7) and if we can safely cut it off or maintain distance.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis for Turn 11**\nPrevious move: RIGHT from (3, 4) $\\rightarrow$ (4, 4).\nYour Head: (4, 4). Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. (Length 4, Score 3).\nSnake #0 Head: (3, 7) or (4, 7) depending on its move.\nSnake #0 Safe Moves (from (3, 7)): UP (3, 8), RIGHT (4, 7).\n\nIf Snake #0 chose UP (3, 8):\nMy Head at (4, 4) vs Enemy Head at (3, 8). Safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 chose RIGHT (4, 7):\nMy Head at (4, 4) vs Enemy Head at (4, 7). Safe separation (3 units vertically).\n\n**My Potential Moves from (4, 4):**\nBody: {(4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}. Backwards move is (4, 3), occupied.\n1. **UP to (4, 5):** Safe.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3):** Collision with body. **DEAD.**\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe. (Returning to previous square).\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (4, 5), LEFT (3, 4), RIGHT (5, 4).\n\n**Enemy Potential Moves (Snake #0 at (3, 7) or (4, 7)):**\nCase A: Snake #0 is at (3, 8). Body: New body includes (3, 7). Backwards move (3, 7), occupied. Safe moves: UP (3, 9), RIGHT (4, 8).\nCase B: Snake #0 is at (4, 7). Body: New body includes (3, 7). Backwards move (3, 7), occupied. Safe moves: UP (4, 8), RIGHT (5, 7).\n\nSince we don't know the previous move of Snake #0, we must consider all safe future moves for Snake #0 based on the current state given for Turn 10 (Head (3, 7)). If we assume Snake #0 picked the most threatening/advancing move that was safe (RIGHT to (4, 7) due to our rightward shift), we should base collision checks on that.\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 moved RIGHT to (4, 7) on Turn 10.\nSnake #0 at (4, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. (Note: If it ate A2, its length should increase, but the body listings provided for T10 seem short/potentially inconsistent with score increase, but we proceed with the coordinates given).\n\nSnake #0 at (4, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)]. Backwards move is (3, 7), occupied.\nSafe Moves for Snake #0: UP (4, 8), RIGHT (5, 7). (DOWN (4, 6) is not threatened by body, but (3, 7) is in path if it moved in from (3, 7) to (4, 7). Wait, if it moved right from (3, 7) to (4, 7), its previous cell (3, 7) is now body, so DOWN to (4, 6) is safe, LEFT to (3, 7) is body collision. Backwards is (3, 7), occupied).\nIf current head is (4, 7), previous spot was (3, 7).\nSafe moves for Snake #0 at (4, 7) if body is [(3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)]:\n1. UP (4, 8) - Safe.\n2. DOWN (4, 6) - Safe.\n3. LEFT (3, 7) - Collision with body. **DEAD.**\n4. RIGHT (5, 7) - Safe.\n\nSnake #0 Safe Moves (assuming it landed at (4, 7)): UP (4, 8), DOWN (4, 6), RIGHT (5, 7).\n\n**Collision Prediction (My moves + Snake #0 moves S_0):**\nI am at (4, 4). I want to move towards A1 (7, 6).\n\n1. **If I move UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   S_0 moves UP to (4, 8): Safe.\n    *   S_0 moves DOWN to (4, 6): Safe. (We stay vertically aligned, 1 unit apart).\n    *   S_0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7): Safe.\n\n2. **If I move LEFT to (3, 4):** (Retreat/Wait)\n    *   S_0 moves UP to (4, 8): Safe.\n    *   S_0 moves DOWN to (4, 6): Safe.\n    *   S_0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7): Safe.\n\n3. **If I move RIGHT to (5, 4):** (Advancing towards A1)\n    *   S_0 moves UP to (4, 8): Safe.\n    *   S_0 moves DOWN to (4, 6): Safe.\n    *   S_0 moves RIGHT to (5, 7): **HEAD-ON COLLISION at (5, 7) if S_0 moves RIGHT?** No, S_0 would be at (5, 7) and I would be at (5, 4). Safe separation.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 4) makes the most progress towards A1 (7, 6). This seems like the best aggressive option, maintaining a safe buffer from Snake #0 which is high up.\n\n**Strategy Update:** Continue advancing towards A1 (7, 6) or A3 (7, 3). A1 is closer. Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) facilitates this.\n\nLong-Term Plan (Turns 11 onwards): Continue moving RIGHT/UP towards A1 (7, 6). Maintain awareness of Snake #0's proximity on the X=3/Y=7 line.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis for Turn 12**\nPrevious move: RIGHT from (4, 4) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 4).\nYour Head: (5, 4). Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. (Length 5, Score 3). (Assuming no apple just eaten).\n\nSnake #0 State Reassessment: We cannot definitively know Snake #0's move on T10. We must rely purely on the T10 board state Head=(3, 7) and T11 state derived from our move at (5, 4). Since no apple coordinates matched (3, 7) when Snake #0 reached it, the state descriptions are inconsistent regarding length/apple counts vs movement path.\n\nLet's rigorously check the Board State provided for T10 again:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. Apples: 3. (Length 4)\nSnake #0: Head (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. Apples: 3. (Length 4)\nIf both snakes just moved (Turn 9), and both have length 4, neither snake ate an apple on Turn 9. This contradicts the score change implied by the Rationale review (Snake 0 moving from Score 2 to 3).\n\n**Crucial Resolution:** The external state description (Scores so far, Board state for T10) *must* be taken as the ground truth for T10 start, *regardless* of previous rationales matching the transition.\nT10 Start: My Head (3, 4), L=4. S0 Head (3, 7), L=4. Both scored 3. This means A2 (3, 7) was already gone before T9, or neither ate on T9. Given the ambiguity, I will assume snake lengths reflect score, and analyze my next move based on the T10 board *coordinates*.\n\nIf T10 starts with Head (3, 4) and S0 Head (3, 7), this implies T9 moves resulted in these positions, AND **neither snake ate an apple on T9**. (If my length is 4, and S0 length is 4, scores are 3/3. If they started T9 at L=4/L=3 or L=3/L=2, a score change implies L change). This implies the provided state description is the result *before* the move resolution of T9 started, OR the provided \"Apples collected\" counts are NOT updating based on the observed body length change from T8 to T9.\n\n**Sticking to the Current Board Coordinates for T10 start:**\nMy Head: (3, 4). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. (Length 4).\nS0 Head: (3, 7). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]. (Length 4).\nApples: A1(7, 6), A3(7, 3), A5(9, 7), A6(6, 8), A4(4, 9). (A2 at (3, 7) is gone/eaten by S0 pre-emptively if S0 is at score 3, but S0 segment at (3, 7) implies it's occupied).\n\nMy move T9 was UP (3, 3) -> (3, 4). This move was safe.\nS0 move T9? S0 moved from (2, 6) to (3, 7). This is impossible in one step.\n\n**Conclusion on State:** The provided board state for Turn 10 MUST be used, and the movement logic must be derived *from* this state, assuming the board positions (Head/Body) are accurate *after* turn 9 resolved, despite inconsistencies with score/length/pathing derived from the rationale.\n\n**Current State (T10 Start, Based on Board):**\nMe: Head (3, 4). Body set $B_1$: {(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}.\nS0: Head (3, 7). Body set $B_0$: {(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)}.\nOccupied cells $O = B_1 \\cup B_0 \\cup \\{(3, 4), (3, 7)\\}$.\n\n**My Move Options from (3, 4):**\nBackwards move to (3, 3) is in $B_1$. **DEAD if move DOWN.**\n1. UP to (3, 5): Safe.\n2. LEFT to (2, 4): Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (4, 4): Safe.\n\n**S0 Move Options from (3, 7):**\nBackwards move to (3, 6) is in $B_0$. **DEAD if move DOWN.**\n1. UP to (3, 8): Safe.\n2.

S0 is cornered at (9, 9) and can only move LEFT to (8, 9).\n\n**My Potential Moves from (5, 2):**\nBody set $B$: {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}.\n1.

We must continue North/West.\n\n1. **I move LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   S0 moves LEFT to (8, 9). Separation is large (4 columns different in X, 7 rows in Y). Safe. This continues the best line towards A4.\n\n2. **I move RIGHT to (6, 2):** (Moving away from A4)\n    *   S0 moves LEFT to (8, 9). Safe.\n\n3. **I move DOWN to (5, 1):** (Losing ground)\n    *   S0 moves LEFT to (8, 9). Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) is the optimal move to press the advantage against the cornered S0 and target the final apple A4 (4, 9).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Move aggressively North/West towards A4 (4, 9) using UP/LEFT moves. S0 is constrained to move LEFT along Y=9 until it hits its body segments (which are far right/down). We should reach A4 safely in 5 moves (e.g., (4, 2) -> (4, 3) [body!] -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) ... Wait, UP moves are blocked).\n\nRevisiting path towards A4(4, 9) from (5, 2):\n(5, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{LEFT}}$ (4, 2) {Safe}\n(4, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{UP}}$ (4, 3) {Collision with my body!}\n\nMy body occupies X=4 rows 3 and 4: {(4, 3), (4, 4)}.\nPath to A4 (4, 9) is blocked by my own body segments! I must reroute around my body which spans X=4 region from Y=3 up to Y=4.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 2), my next move UP to (4, 3) is blocked. My only option from (4, 2) is likely DOWN to (4, 1) or RIGHT to (5, 2) [if (5, 2) isn't body].\n(5, 2) is NOT body. If I go (4, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 2) this retreats one turn.\n\nIf (4, 2) is reached:\n(4, 2) Backwards: (5, 2) (Not body).\nSafe moves: UP (4, 3) [DEAD], DOWN (4, 1) [Safe], LEFT (3, 2) [Safe], RIGHT (5, 2) [Safe].\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) exposes viable paths: (4, 1) or (3, 2). (3, 2) is better for reaching (4, 9).\n\nTherefore, LEFT is still the best first step to penetrate the region near A4.\n\nLEFT",

S0's body extends far down the right edge. Its forward movement option is LEFT towards (7, 9). If S0 moves LEFT to (7, 9), we are still far apart.\n\nMy Head is at H1=(4, 2).\nMy Body $B_1$: {(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}. (Note: (5, 2) is now empty space).\nS0 Head is at H0=(8, 9).\nS0 Body $B_0$: {(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6)}.\n\n**My Potential Moves from (4, 2):**\n1. UP to (4, 3): Collision with my body segment (4, 3). **DEAD.**\n2. DOWN to (4, 1): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (3, 2): Safe. (Moving slightly towards A4 (4, 9)).\n4. RIGHT to (5, 2): Safe. (Moving back towards previous position).\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (4, 1), LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2).\n\n**S0 Potential Moves from (8, 9):**\nS0 cannot move UP (off board). S0 cannot move RIGHT or DOWN into its own body or edge easily.\n*   LEFT to (7, 9): Appears safe, moving along the edge. (My previous analysis assumed it continued left along Y=9, which is the only open path on that row).\n*   UP: Impossible (Off board).\n*   DOWN to (8, 8): Safe from $B_O$.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 9): Collision with S0's own tail/body segment (9, 9). **DEAD.**\n\nS0 safe moves: (7, 9) or (8, 8). Let's assume S0 prefers to stay on the edge/top, so (7, 9) seems likely, or perhaps (8, 8) to try to maneuver downwards.\n\n**Collision Analysis based on potential outcomes:**\nWe aim for A4 (4, 9). We must go UP. Since UP=(4, 3) is blocked by my own body, we need a maneuver to escape the blockage region (X=2 to X=5, Y=2 to Y=4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2):\n*   If S0 moves to (7, 9): Safe. I gain ground towards X=0/1.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 2):\n*   If S0 moves to (7, 9): Safe. I am moving away from X=4 target column.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 1):\n*   If S0 moves to (7, 9): Safe. I am moving to the bottom edge, delaying approach to A4.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 2) seems best to navigate towards the left side of my body blockage and eventually move up towards X=4, 9. From (3, 2), next move UP is (3, 3) which IS my body!\nIf H1 moves to (3, 2):\nH1=(3, 2). B1={..., (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)}. (3, 3) is body.\nFrom (3, 2): UP (3, 3) -> DEAD. DOWN (3, 1) -> Safe. LEFT (2, 2) -> DEAD (Body segment). RIGHT (4, 2) -> Safe.\n\nThis region near my tail (X=2, 3, 4, Y=2, 3, 4) seems heavily constrained due to my own growth pattern. Moving LEFT to (3, 2) simply lands me in another dead end regarding upward movement.\n\nLet's re-examine the body structure around the head (4, 2):\nY: 4 3 [Body]\n   4 2 [Head] <-- Current position (4, 2)\nY: 5 4 3 2 1 0 <- Neighbors\nX: 3 [B] [B] [S] [S] [S]\nX: 4 [B] [H] [S] [S] [S] <-- H=(4, 2). B=(4, 3), (4, 4)\nX: 5 [S] [B] [S] [S] [S]\n\nNeighbors of (4, 2):\nUp (4, 3) is Body B1.\nDown (4, 1) is Safe.\nLeft (3, 2) is Safe.\nRight (5, 2) is Safe.\n\nIf I go (4, 1) (DOWN):\nFrom (4, 1): UP (4, 2) is safe (former head position). My body segments are low enough that I can easily maneuver around Y=0/1 region. This seems like a good way to exit the local constrained area safely.\n\nIf I go (5, 2) (RIGHT):\nFrom (5, 2): UP (5, 3) is Body B1. DEAD. This traps me into moving only LEFT or DOWN from (5, 2). (5, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{LEFT}}$ (4, 2). (5, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{DOWN}}$ (5, 1). (5, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{RIGHT}}$ (6, 2).\n\nIf I go (3, 2) (LEFT):\nFrom (3, 2): UP (3, 3) is Body B1. DEAD. Trapped into moving only RIGHT or DOWN from (3, 2). (3, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{RIGHT}}$ (4, 2). (3, 2) $\\xrightarrow{\\text{DOWN}}$ (3, 1).\n\nConclusion: Moving DOWN to (4, 1) provides the maximum flexibility for the subsequent move, allowing me to return to (4, 2) next turn if needed (using UP), or move left/right along Y=1. This grants a better chance to find a path upwards towards A4 (4, 9) without immediately getting trapped next turn. S0 is not close enough to pose an immediate threat.\n\nLong-Term Plan:\nUse DOWN move (4, 1) to safely exit the local immediate vicinity where upward movement is blocked by my own body segment (4, 3). In the next turn, plan to move UP (if available) or LEFT/RIGHT while attempting to gain latitude to climb towards A4 (4, 9). Continuously monitor S0's slow progress top right.\n\nLEFT was chosen last turn.\nDOWN seems best to ensure flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

S0 is moving away from A4=(4, 9) in both cases, but slowly towards my current position (4, 1) is not a concern yet. S0 seems focused on securing territory on the top edge or winding down the right side.\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\nWe are still aiming for A4 (4, 9). We must move UP eventually.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 2): This is the safest move, immediately reversing the previous move. This guarantees I can then attempt to move LEFT/RIGHT/UP again next turn (assuming S0 doesn't trap me). If S0 moves to (6, 9), next turn I can try RIGHT to (5, 2) or LEFT to (3, 2) to start climbing again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 0): This keeps me low. From (4, 0), next move UP is (4, 1) or SIDE moves. This delays addressing the block at (4, 3).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 1): From (3, 1), UP is (3, 2). From (3, 2), UP is (3, 3) which is my body! So LEFT is risky as it forces me towards the (3, 2) which leads to a trap again.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 1): From (5, 1), UP is (5, 2). From (5, 2), UP is (5, 3) which is my body! This is also risky for the same reason.\n\nRevisiting the UP move (4, 2):\nH1 = (4, 2). Neighbors: UP (4, 3) is Body. DOWN (4, 1) is Safe. LEFT (3, 2). RIGHT (5, 2).\nIf I move UP, next turn I can choose LEFT (3, 2) or RIGHT (5, 2) to start climbing out toward Y=3/4, where the body segments are thinner. This looks like the best way to regain vertical momentum safely.\n\nStrategy Note: Reverse the DOWN move to (4, 2) to regain a position that allows lateral movement toward the columns adjacent to the body block, setting up a better ascent in future turns. S0 is predictable along the edge for now.\n\nUP seems optimal for safety and setting up the next escape maneuver.\n\nUP\n---\nLong-term plan (for reference next turn): The primary goal remains reaching A4 (4, 9). Having reversed to (4, 2), the goal next turn is to move laterally (LEFT to (3, 2) or RIGHT to (5, 2)) in order to position the head such that the subsequent move UP ($Y \\to 3$) avoids collision with the body segments at $Y=3$. If (4, 2) is chosen, the next move should investigate (3, 2) or (5, 2) unless S0 closes the gap significantly.\n\nUP",
