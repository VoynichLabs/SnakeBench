In our analysis the most promising target is the one that steers us upward in our board area.\n\n\u2022 Checking our immediate moves:\n\u2003 \u2013 Moving UP from (4,1) goes into (4,2), which is already part of our body.\n\u2003 \u2013 Moving DOWN to (4,0) is safe but moves us away from our promising area.\n\u2003 \u2013 Moving LEFT to (3,1) is safe, but from there working upward toward our targets looks a bit awkward given our snake\u2019s current body formation.\n\u2003 \u2013 Moving RIGHT to (5,1) is safe; and under standard rules the tail will move on so it frees up the cell (2,3). More importantly, moving RIGHT gives us a clear turning option (for example, going UP from (5,1) on a future turn) so we can eventually maneuver toward the target apple (one promising candidate being the apple at (6,5)).\n\nGiven these factors\u2014with no immediate threat from the enemy snake which is far off\u2014and wanting our snake to have room to plan an upward path, our best move is to continue heading RIGHT.\n\nThus, my next move is: RIGHT."

That means from (8,5) our upward option is blocked and we\u2019d be forced to make a sharp turn. The alternatives from (8,5) are then left or right. Turning right (to (9,5)) puts us close to the enemy snake (which has its head at (9,8) and body in the upper right). That lateral move risks shrinking our available space as the enemy lurks in that corner.\n\n2. On the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,4) keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s cluster. From (7,4) our next possible moves would be UP to (7,5) or further LEFT to (6,4). Both these cells are free according to the board state, allowing us flexibility to aim for the apples (for example, heading eventually toward the apple at (5,6) or even the ones in the top left).\n\nGiven that safety and room for maneuver are key in Snake (remember, a single misstep into enemy territory could be fatal), the leftward move seems to offer the best balance of avoidance and future options.\n\nThus, for our next move I decide to go: LEFT."

Looking at our nearby options from our head (1,6):\n\n\u2022 UP would move to (1,7). That square is free, and from there we could plan to get the apple at (0,7), but that would put us near the enemy snake\u2019s head at (0,8).\n\n\u2022 LEFT would move to (0,6). This is clear, and from there the next move could be UP to (0,7), but again we\u2019d be a toss-up near the enemy\u2019s position.\n\n\u2022 RIGHT is not an option since (2,6) is part of our own body.\n\n\u2022 DOWN would move to (1,5). The square is empty (as seen in row 5 of the board), and from there our head is well positioned to reach the apple at (2,5) on the following turn\u2014a quick, safe, two-move path.\n\nConsidering safety and the proximity of enemy snake segments, moving DOWN is the best immediate choice. My plan is to head DOWN now to (1,5) and then plan to move RIGHT into the apple at (2,5) on my next turn.\n\nThus, my next move is: DOWN."
