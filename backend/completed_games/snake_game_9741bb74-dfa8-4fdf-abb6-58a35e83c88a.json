The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (0,7) with no body segments either. There are apples at (2,3), (7,3), (7,4), (2,7), and (7,2).\n\nSince I'm at the left edge of the board (x=0), LEFT would move me off the board to (-1,1), which would kill me.

However, I need to consider where the enemy snake might move.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,7). It can move UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), LEFT (invalid), or RIGHT to (1,7). Since LEFT is invalid for them too, they'll likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones to me are at (2,3) and (2,7). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to both of these apples, while UP/DOWN only change my y-coordinate without getting me closer to any apples.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (1,1) gives me more options for future moves - I'll be away from the edge and have more freedom to maneuver. Moving UP or DOWN keeps me on the left edge with limited options.\n\nThere's no immediate threat of head-on collision since the enemy is far away at y=7 while I'm at y=1.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Move toward the cluster of apples around (2,3) and (2,7), while avoiding moving too close to the enemy snake at the top left. Try to collect apples and grow while maintaining safe movement options.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 is at head (7,7) with body at (7,6).\n\nPossible moves from (7,3):\n- UP: (7,4) - contains an apple!\n- DOWN: (7,2) - contains an apple!\n- LEFT: (6,3) - my own body segment (would die)\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - empty\n\nLEFT is immediately eliminated as it would move into my own body at (6,3).\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- Both UP and DOWN lead directly to apples - this is excellent\n- RIGHT is safe but doesn't capture an apple immediately\n- The enemy snake at (7,7) could potentially move DOWN to (7,6) (its own body), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7), or UP to (7,8)\n- None of the enemy's moves directly threaten my position at (7,3) or the apple cells\n- After eating an apple, my body will extend, but I'll have good movement options\n\nI should prioritize capturing an apple. Both UP and DOWN are equally good for immediate apple capture. However, looking at the board layout:\n- UP to (7,4) puts me closer to the enemy snake at (7,7) - this might be riskier in future turns\n- DOWN to (7,2) moves me away from the enemy and toward the bottom of the board where there are fewer obstacles\n- The bottom area has more open space and another apple at (1,2) that I could potentially target later\n\nDOWN seems slightly better as it moves me away from the enemy snake and toward less congested areas of the board.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** After capturing the apple at (7,2), I'll be at (7,2) with a longer body. From there, I can consider moving toward the other apples at (1,2) or (9,2), but should prioritize safety and maintaining maneuverability.

DOWN and LEFT both give 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (8, 2) with apple at (9, 2) to its RIGHT. It will likely go RIGHT to eat it, growing to length 5 next turn. That moves enemy away from my area.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want (3, 8) apple. LEFT moves me toward it. DOWN moves me toward center but away from (3, 8).  \nLEFT also keeps me near top row where enemy isn\u2019t currently.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoiding dead ends:**  \nUP reduces options too much, so avoid.  \nLEFT seems best: toward apple, safe next moves, enemy moving away.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 8), if enemy eats (9, 2), it will be longer but far away. I can go LEFT again toward (3, 8) or DOWN/UP to avoid boxing myself.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

My body segments are: [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2)] - 5 segments total.\nApples at: (7,4), (1,2), (5,0), (8,5), (1,5)\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (2,8) with body [(3,8), (4,8)]\n\nPossible moves from (8,4):\n- UP: (8,5) - contains an apple\n- DOWN: (8,3) - my own body segment (would die)\n- LEFT: (7,4) - contains an apple\n- RIGHT: (9,4) - empty\n\nDOWN is eliminated as it would hit my body. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe options.\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- UP moves me to (8,5) where I can collect the apple and grow\n- LEFT moves me to (7,4) where I can collect the apple and grow\n- RIGHT moves me to (9,4) which is empty but safe\n- Both UP and LEFT lead to immediate apple collection, which is highly beneficial\n- The apple at (8,5) is directly adjacent and would require moving UP\n- The apple at (7,4) is directly adjacent and would require moving LEFT\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,4) doesn't collect an apple but keeps me safe\n- The enemy snake is far away at (2,8) and not an immediate threat\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are excellent choices since they collect apples. RIGHT is safe but doesn't provide immediate benefit. Between UP and LEFT, I should consider which one gives better positioning for future moves:\n- After UP to (8,5): I'll have eaten the apple and grown. From (8,5), I could move LEFT to (7,5), DOWN to (8,4) (but that's now my body), or RIGHT to (9,5)\n- After LEFT to (7,4): I'll have eaten the apple and grown. From (7,4), I could move UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), or LEFT to (6,4)\n\nUP appears slightly better because (8,5) gives me access to the right side of the board which has more open space, while LEFT moves me toward the center where I might have more constraints later. However, both are good options.\n\nSince I have multiple safe moves that collect apples, I should prioritize apple collection to increase my score advantage over the enemy snake.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** After collecting an apple this turn, I should focus on maintaining safe movement options. The enemy snake is still small and distant, so I can continue collecting apples efficiently while avoiding trapping myself. I should consider moving toward the remaining apples at (1,2), (5,0), and (1,5) after securing the nearby ones.\n\nUP",

Avoid moving back into column x=1 because body blocks upward movement there. Next turn from (2, 2), consider UP to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 2) to continue toward apples while keeping safe distance from enemy.\n\n**Best move:** RIGHT \u2013 safe now, good future mobility, closer to apples.\n\nRIGHT",

UP gives three safe moves next turn and also can get apple (0, 5) by going LEFT next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (0, 1) can only go UP or DOWN. If it goes UP to (0, 2), it moves toward apple (0, 5). If it goes DOWN to (0, 0), it moves away. Enemy is long (length 10), so it may try to get apple (0, 5) too. If I go LEFT to (0, 4), enemy could be at (0, 2) next turn, then (0, 3) turn after, competing for apple (0, 5). If I go UP to (1, 5), I can still reach (0, 5) next turn before enemy if enemy goes UP two turns in a row.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 9 apples, I have 7. Need to catch up. Apple (0, 5) is closest. Going LEFT now gets me adjacent to it, but enemy might race for it. Going UP gives more flexibility and still lets me grab (0, 5) next turn while keeping more options. Also, UP avoids being stuck on left edge with limited moves after eating apple.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s restricted moves (only UP/DOWN), I can predict it will likely go UP toward apple. If I go LEFT to (0, 4), we might collide head-on next turn if enemy goes UP twice and I go UP to (0, 5) while enemy goes to (0, 5) same turn. That\u2019s risky. Better to go UP now, then next turn decide: if enemy is at (0, 2), I can go LEFT to (0, 5) and eat apple before enemy can reach it (enemy would need two more moves to get to (0, 5) from (0, 2)).  \n\n**Best move:** UP  \n\nUP",
