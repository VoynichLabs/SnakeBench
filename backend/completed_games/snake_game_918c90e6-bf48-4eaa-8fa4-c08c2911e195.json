          "rationale": "Okay, I'm playing Snake game against one enemy. Let me check the current board state carefully.\n\nMy snake (ID 0) is at (7,7) with no body yet. Enemy snake #1 is at (9,4) with no body. Apples are scattered across the board.\n\nI need to consider my possible moves: UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), or RIGHT to (8,7).\n\nFirst, check if any move would kill me:\n- RIGHT to (8,7): This is within the board (0-9 for both x and y). No body to hit. Enemy is at (9,4), so not colliding. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,7): Within board. Apple at (6,2) and (6,6) but not at (6,7). Safe.\n- UP to (7,8): Within board. There's an apple at (7,5) but that's down from here, not up. Safe.\n- DOWN to (7,6): Within board. Apple at (7,5) is one step down from (7,6), so this would get me closer to that apple. Safe.\n\nAll four moves seem safe initially since we have no body and the enemy is far away at (9,4).\n\nNow I need to think strategically. I'm at (7,7). The closest apples are:\n- (7,5) is 2 steps down\n- (6,6) is 1 step left and 1 step down\n- (6,2) is 1 step left and 4 steps down\n- (5,5) is 2 steps left and 2 steps down\n\nThe enemy is at (9,4), which is quite far from me, so immediate collision isn't a concern.\n\nI should think about future moves. If I go RIGHT to (8,7), my next options would be limited - I could go back LEFT to (7,7), UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6), or RIGHT to (9,7). (9,7) has an apple! That's interesting. But going RIGHT now would also put me closer to the enemy's position at (9,4), though still far away.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7), I'm moving toward apples at (6,6) and (6,2). (6,6) is particularly close - just one step down from there. That seems promising.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the apple at (7,5) and also (6,6) is one step left.\n\nIf I go UP to (7,8), I don't see any immediate apples, and I'm moving away from several apples.\n\nConsidering long-term strategy, I want to avoid getting trapped. The board has apples scattered, but I should aim for clusters. The apple at (6,6) seems like a good target because it's close to (7,5) and (6,2). \n\nGoing DOWN to (7,6) gives me the option to then go LEFT to (6,6) and eat the apple, or DOWN to (7,5) to eat that apple. Both are good options.\n\nGoing LEFT to (6,7) gives me the option to go DOWN to (6,6) immediately.\n\nI think DOWN to (7,6) is a good first move because:\n1. It keeps me safe\n2. It gets me closer to multiple apples\n3. It gives me good options for the next turn\n4. It doesn't immediately put me near the enemy\n\nLet me also consider the enemy's potential moves. The enemy is at (9,4). They might go for apples at (9,5), (8,9), or (9,7). If they go UP to (9,5), that's an apple. If they go LEFT to (8,4), that's empty. They might be targeting the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nSince we're not close to each other yet, I should focus on my own growth first.\n\nDOWN seems like the best move to start collecting apples efficiently.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let me analyze the current game state very carefully.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (7,6), body empty, apples: 0\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (9,5), body [(9,4)], apples: 1\n- Apples are at: (1,6), (0,9), (7,5), (0,4), (5,5), (2,8), (2,1), (6,2), (2,7), (9,7), (8,9), (6,6), (2,0), (7,2), (2,6)\n- My last move was DOWN to (7,6)\n\n**Important Observations:**\n1. **Immediate Danger**: The enemy snake head is at (9,5). If they move LEFT to (8,5) or DOWN to (9,4), they could potentially threaten me later. But more importantly, if they move RIGHT to (10,5), they'd die (off board). If they move UP to (9,6), they'd be moving toward my head area. If they move LEFT to (8,5), that's an empty space.\n\n2. **Apple Priority**: The closest apples to me are:\n   - (7,5): 1 step DOWN from (7,6)\n   - (6,6): 1 step LEFT from (7,6)\n   - (6,2): 4 steps DOWN\n   - (5,5): 2 steps LEFT, 1 step DOWN\n\n3. **Body Growth**: I currently have no body, so moving into my own body isn't a concern. However, after this move, I will have a body segment.\n\n4. **Critical Decision**: If I move DOWN to (7,5), I will eat an apple and grow. My body would be at (7,6). This seems optimal because:\n   - I get an apple (+1 point)\n   - I grow longer (which is good for defense and future moves)\n   - I remain relatively central on the board\n   - I still have multiple escape routes: UP to (7,6) (back to where I was), LEFT to (6,5), RIGHT to (8,5), or DOWN to (7,4) if needed next turn\n\n5. **Alternative Considerations**:\n   - LEFT to (6,6): Also an apple, but puts me at the left edge with potentially fewer future options\n   - RIGHT to (8,6): No apple, moves toward edge\n   - UP to (7,7): No apple, moves away from food\n\n6. **Enemy Prediction**: The enemy at (9,5) with body at (9,4) has limited options. They likely want to eat the apple at (9,7) or (8,9), or maybe (8,9) via (8,5). If they go UP to (9,6), that could be dangerous if I go LEFT to (6,6) and they pursue the same direction. But given the distance, we're not in immediate collision danger.\n\n**Long-term Strategy**: \nI should focus on securing apples efficiently while maintaining board control. The board has clusters near my position: (7,5), (6,6), (5,5), (6,2), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). By eating (7,5) first, I position myself to easily access these clusters. I need to be mindful of the enemy snake who has already collected 1 apple and is positioned on the right side of the board. I should avoid getting cornered near the right edge.\n\n**Safety Check**:\n- DOWN to (7,5): On board (x=7, y=5). No body to hit. Enemy is at (9,5) - different x coordinate, so no collision. Safe.\n\n**Final Decision**: \nMoving DOWN to eat the apple at (7,5) is the best move. It gives me my first point, grows my body, and keeps me central with good future options.\n\nDOWN",

This is moving backwards into my own body \u2192 DEAD\n   - **LEFT (to 6,5)**: Empty space (no snake, no apple shown). But check: I would be moving into the path of the enemy's potential movement. Enemy at (9,6) could move LEFT to (8,6). If I move LEFT to (6,5), no immediate collision. Safe.\n   - **DOWN (to 7,4)**: Empty space. Safe, but moves me away from apples and toward the bottom edge.\n   - **RIGHT (to 8,5)**: Empty space. Safe. However, this moves me closer to the enemy at (9,6).\n\n2. **Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n   - Enemy at (9,6) has body at (9,5). Their possible moves:\n     - UP to (9,7) \u2192 There's an apple at (9,7)! This is likely their move.\n     - LEFT to (8,6) \u2192 Also an option.\n     - DOWN to (9,5) \u2192 Their own body! DEAD\n     - RIGHT to (10,6) \u2192 Off board \u2192 DEAD\n   - **Most likely enemy move: UP to (9,7)** to eat the apple.\n   - If they do that, they grow and their body will be [(9,6), (9,5)] next turn.\n\n3. **Apple Opportunities:**\n   - From (7,5), the nearest apples are:\n     - (6,6): LEFT+UP (2 moves)\n     - (5,5): LEFT+DOWN (2 moves)\n     - (6,2): LEFT+DOWN (4 moves)\n     - (2,6) cluster: Further left\n   - No apple at immediate adjacent cells now.\n\n4. **Strategic Positioning:**\n   - Moving RIGHT to (8,5) puts me at the right edge but still has escape routes:\n     - Back LEFT to (7,5) (my tail will move, so this won't be blocked)\n     - UP to (8,6)\n     - DOWN to (8,4)\n     - Right to (9,5) \u2192 This is currently the enemy's body position (9,5)! If the enemy moves UP to (9,7), then (9,5) will become empty (the enemy's tail will be at (9,6) after moving). So RIGHT could be safe next turn.\n   - Moving LEFT to (6,5) gives better board control and more apple options.\n\n5. **Long-term Planning:**\n   - I should aim for the apple cluster at (6,6), (5,5), (6,2), (2,6), etc.\n   - The enemy is positioned at the right edge and likely going for (9,7). If I move RIGHT, I might start competing for right-side apples, which is their territory.\n   - Moving LEFT maintains central board control and keeps me away from the enemy's likely path.\n   - From (6,5), I have easy access to (6,6) [UP], (5,5) [DOWN+LEFT], and (6,2) [DOWN+DOWN+DOWN].\n\n6. **Critical Observation:**\n   - If I move RIGHT to (8,5) and the enemy moves UP to (9,7), we're on different paths. But if the enemy decides to move LEFT instead (to 8,6), then moving RIGHT puts my head at (8,5) and their head at (8,6) - adjacent but not colliding. Still safe for this turn.\n   - However, if I move LEFT to (6,5), I maintain better positioning against a potentially aggressive enemy who might later pursue me into the central area.\n\n7. **Safety vs. Reward:**\n   - Neither LEFT nor RIGHT gives an immediate apple.\n   - LEFT keeps me away from the enemy's likely path and provides more future options.\n   - RIGHT moves me closer to the enemy, which could be risky if they change plans or if we both pursue the same apple later.\n\n**Final Decision:** LEFT to (6,5) is the safest and most strategically sound move. It maintains central board control, keeps me away from the enemy's likely trajectory, and positions me perfectly to collect the (6,6) apple next turn while having multiple escape routes. The RIGHT move, while not immediately deadly, unnecessarily moves me into the enemy's periphery and limits my future apple access.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn 3. My snake (ID 0) has head at (6,5) and body at [(7,5)] (the tail). Apples collected: 1. Enemy snake #1 is at head (9,7) with body [(9,6), (9,5)] and apples: 2. Board state is 10x10. Apples are many, including nearby ones like (6,6) above, (5,5) down-left, (6,2) down, etc. The enemy is at the right edge and likely will move to chase an apple or stay safe.\n\nI must consider all directions from (6,5) and check immediate safety. My body occupies (7,5) to the right. Moving RIGHT to (7,5) would hit my own body -> death. So RIGHT is deadly.\n\nMoving UP to (6,6): Check if (6,6) is empty. According to board state, (6,6) is an apple (there's an apple at (6,6)). There's no snake there. Enemy at (9,7) is far. I need to ensure moving UP doesn't cause a collision with enemy's possible move. Enemy's head at (9,7) could move DOWN to (9,6) (but that's its own body? Wait its body is (9,6) and (9,5). So (9,6) is its body, so DOWN is deadly for enemy. LEFT to (8,7) possible. UP to (9,8) possible. RIGHT to (10,7) off board. So enemy likely won't move to (6,6). So UP is safe.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,4): Empty? No apple there. Safe.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,5): There's an apple at (5,5). That's also an apple. So LEFT also gives an apple.\n\nBut wait, my current head is (6,5). Both UP (6,6) and LEFT (5,5) are apples. Which is better?\n\nNeed to consider future safety and avoiding traps. Also consider enemy's potential moves. The enemy is at (9,7) with two apples already. It might try to go for other apples like (8,9) or (9,9) maybe. But there's also apple at (8,9) and (9,9?) Actually board shows apple at (8,9) and (0,9) etc. So enemy might head upward.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,5), I eat apple at (5,5). My body will extend to (6,5) as tail? Actually after moving, my new head at (5,5), body will be [(6,5), (7,5)] because the old head (6,5) becomes part of body, and old tail (7,5) stays (unless we grow, then tail doesn't move? Actually when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment, so your tail does NOT move for that turn. So after moving LEFT and eating, my new body will be [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5)]? Wait careful: The head moves to (5,5). The previous head (6,5) becomes the first body segment. The previous body (7,5) remains the tail. Since we ate an apple, we grow, so we keep the tail (7,5) as well. So body becomes [(5,5) is head? No, the head is (5,5), but body list is head-to-tail: first tuple is head, so body list will be [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5)]. Actually the head is included in the list. So after moving, my snake will be: head (5,5), then body segments (6,5) and (7,5). So length 3.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,6) and eat apple, new body: head (6,6), then (6,5) and (7,5). That's also length 3.\n\nNow check immediate safety for each:\n\nFor LEFT (5,5): Need to check if any snake occupies (5,5) currently. Board shows apple at (5,5) but no snake. Enemy at (9,7). So safe. However, need to consider enemy's possible move that could cause collision on same turn. Enemy might move to (8,7) or (9,8) etc. Not near (5,5). So safe.\n\nFor UP (6,6): Same, apple there, no snake. Safe.\n\nBut we also need to consider that moving to an apple is beneficial because it gives a point and growth. However, we already have 1 apple, enemy has 2. We need to catch up. So eating an apple now is good.\n\nNow, which direction gives better future prospects?\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I'm at x=5,y=5. Nearby apples: (5,5) eaten, (6,6) up, (6,2) down, (2,6) left, etc. Also I'm closer to the center/left side.\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I'm at x=6,y=6. Nearby apples: (6,6) eaten, (5,5) down-left, (6,2) down, (2,6) left, (7,2) right-down, etc.\n\nNow consider the enemy's potential movements. Enemy at (9,7) could move UP to (9,8) (empty), LEFT to (8,7) (empty), or DOWN to (9,6) (its own body, deadly). So likely UP or LEFT. If it moves UP, it might chase apple at (8,9) or (9,9). If LEFT, it goes towards center. We need to avoid future head-on collisions. Being at (5,5) vs (6,6) might affect that.\n\nAlso consider board edges: At (6,6) I'm near right edge? x=6 is still central, but right edge at x=9. So both are central.\n\nNow think about traps: My body is at (7,5) currently. If I move UP to (6,6), my body becomes (6,5) and (7,5). If later I want to go right, I might have to be careful not to hit my own body. At (6,6), moving right to (7,6) might be safe if (7,6) is empty. Currently (7,6) is empty? Board shows (7,6) is empty (there's a T at (7,6)? Wait board shows at (7,6) it's a T? Let's examine the board state given:\n\nBoard:\nRow 9: 9 A . . . . . . . A .  (so (9,9)=A, (8,9)=A? Actually column 9 row9: A, column8 row9: ., column7 row9: ., etc. Let's map properly.)\n\nActually the board is displayed as:\n 9 A . . . . . . . A .\n 8 . . A . . . . . . .\n 7 . . A . . . . . . 1\n 6 . A A . . . A . . T\n 5 A . . . A A 0 T . T\n 4 A . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . A A . .\n 1 . . A . . . . . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nInterpretation: Each row is y coordinate from 9 top to 0 bottom. Each column from 0 left to 9 right.\n\nSo at (6,6): row 6 (y=6), column 6 (x=6). Row 6 shows: \". A A . . . A . . T\" Wait the string: \". A A . . . A . . T\" That's 10 characters? Let's count: characters: 0: ., 1: A, 2: A, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: A, 7: ., 8: ., 9: T. So column6 (index6) is A? Actually index6 is the 7th character: after the three dots? Let's list indices: 0:., 1:A, 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:A, 7:., 8:., 9:T. So column6 (x=6) is 'A' (apple). That matches (6,6) apple.\n\nAt (5,5): row5 (y=5): \"A . . . A A 0 T . T\" Wait row5: \"A . . . A A 0 T . T\" That's 10 chars: index0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:A,6:0,7:T,8:.,9:T. So column5 (x=5) is index5: A (apple). Good.\n\nNow check other cells around these positions to see if any are occupied by snakes.\n\nEnemy at (9,7): row7 (y=7): \". . A . . . . . . 1\" So column9 (x=9) is '1' (enemy head). Body at (9,6) and (9,5): row6 column9 is T? Row6 col9 is T (tail). row5 col9 is T (tail). So enemy's tail is at (9,5) and (9,6) is also part of body? Actually enemy body list is [(9,6), (9,5)] so (9,6) is first body segment, (9,5) is tail. On board, row6 col9 is T (tail), row5 col9 is T (tail). That seems consistent: two T's.\n\nNow my body at (7,5): row5 col7 is T (tail). That's shown as T in board at (7,5). So my tail is at (7,5). Good.\n\nNow check potential moves:\n\nIf I move UP to (6,6): I need to ensure (6,6) is empty except apple. It is apple, fine. But also need to ensure enemy doesn't move into (6,6) same turn. Unlikely as enemy is far.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,5): apple, fine.\n\nNow consider if moving UP to (6,6) could be dangerous because of my own body after move. My new body will be (6,5) and (7,5). (6,5) is currently empty? Actually (6,5) is currently empty? Board row5 col6: row5 col6 is '0' (my head). So (6,5) is my current head, but after move it becomes body segment. So it will be occupied by my body. That's fine.\n\nBut what about moving DOWN to (6,4)? That's empty, no apple, but safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT is deadly because hits my own body at (7,5).\n\nSo among safe moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN.\n\nNow we need to decide which is best. We should aim to eat apples to gain points and grow. So DOWN is less attractive because no apple there. So between UP and LEFT, both have apples.\n\nConsider future paths: If I go to (6,6), I can next turn go to (5,5) (if still apple), or (6,7) maybe, or (7,6) etc. If I go to (5,5), I can next turn go to (6,6) (apple), or (4,5), or (5,6), etc.\n\nAlso need to consider the enemy. The enemy is at the right edge. If I go to (6,6), I'm closer to the right side. Could the enemy move LEFT and come towards me? Possibly. But we have many turns left (3/150). We need to survive and outlast.\n\nAlso note that the board has many apples. We can grow a lot. The key is to avoid collisions and plan a path that doesn't trap us.\n\nThink about the board layout: There is a cluster of apples at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,6), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9) etc. The left side is rich. The right side has apples at (8,9), (9,7) (which enemy might take), (6,6), (6,2), (7,2), (8,9). So both sides have apples.\n\nGiven the enemy is on the right, maybe we should focus on the left side to avoid competition and potential confrontations. That suggests moving LEFT towards the left cluster.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I'm already left of center. From there, I can go further left to (4,5) then (3,5) etc. That might lead to the (2,6) cluster.\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I'm more central, still can go left later.\n\nBut also consider that moving UP to (6,6) puts me at y=6, which might be higher and closer to top apples like (2,8), (0,9). However, there's also apple at (6,6) itself.\n\nNow, we must also consider the enemy's possible move. If enemy moves UP to (9,8) or LEFT to (8,7). If it moves LEFT, it goes to (8,7). That's still far from us. No immediate threat.\n\nBut we need to think ahead: if we both go for the same apple? Not now.\n\nOne more factor: The enemy has 2 apples, we have 1. We need to catch up. Eating an apple now is crucial. So both UP and LEFT give us an apple. Which one is safer in terms of not getting trapped? Let's examine the surroundings after each move.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,5):\n- Head at (5,5). Body segments at (6,5) and (7,5).\n- Check surrounding cells for immediate escape options next turn:\n  - UP to (5,6): Is it empty? Board row6 col5: row6 col5 is '.'? Actually row6: \". A A . . . A . . T\" so col5 (x=5) is '.' (empty). So UP is open.\n  - DOWN to (5,4): row4 col5: row4 is \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so col5 is '.' empty.\n  - LEFT to (4,5): row5 col4: row5 col4 is 'A' (apple at (4,5)? Actually row5 col4 is 'A'? Let's see row5: \"A . . . A A 0 T . T\" indices: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:A,5:A,6:0,7:T,8:.,9:T. So col4 (x=4) is 'A' (apple). So LEFT is apple.\n  - RIGHT to (6,5): This is my own body segment (6,5) (since my body will include (6,5)). So RIGHT is deadly (self collision). So from (5,5), we cannot move RIGHT because it's occupied by our own body. That's a limitation: we have only 3 safe directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT. That's okay.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,6):\n- Head at (6,6). Body segments at (6,5) and (7,5).\n- Check surroundings:\n  - UP to (6,7): row7 col6: row7 is \". . A . . . . . . 1\" so col6 is '.' empty.\n  - DOWN to (6,5): This is my own body segment (6,5) -> deadly.\n  - LEFT to (5,6): row6 col5 is '.' empty (as above).\n  - RIGHT to (7,6): row6 col7 is '.'? Row6 col7 is '.' (since row6: col7 is '.'). So RIGHT is empty.\nSo from (6,6), we have UP, LEFT, RIGHT as safe directions, but DOWN is deadly. That's also 3 safe directions.\n\nBoth give similar number of escapes.\n\nNow consider future growth: If we eat an apple, we grow. That could affect our ability to maneuver. With longer body, we might block ourselves. But both moves grow us to length 3.\n\nNow, which direction leads to less risk of being trapped by the enemy later? The enemy is on the right, so moving LEFT might be safer to stay away from enemy's potential expansion.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (6,6) and (5,5). If we choose one, the other remains for later possibly. But we might want to collect multiple apples quickly.\n\nLet's think about a sequence: If we go LEFT to (5,5) now, next turn we could go UP to (5,6) (empty) or LEFT to (4,5) (apple) or DOWN to (5,4) (empty). If we go to (4,5) and eat another apple, we grow again. That could be good.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,6) now, next turn we could go LEFT to (5,5) (apple) or UP to (6,7) (empty) or RIGHT to (7,6) (empty). If we go to (5,5) later, we can eat that apple.\n\nSo both paths allow eating both apples eventually. However, the order might affect our position relative to the enemy.\n\nAnother consideration: The enemy might go for the apple at (9,7) (its head is already at (9,7) and there is an apple there? Wait board shows at (9,7): row7 col9 is '1' (enemy head). But there is also an apple at (9,7)? Let's check apple list: apples at (1,6), (0,9), (0,4), (5,5), (2,8), (2,1), (6,2), (2,7), (8,9), (6,6), (2,0), (7,2), (2,6), (4,5), (0,5). There's no (9,7) apple. Actually the apple list doesn't include (9,7). But the board shows a '1' at (9,7) which is the enemy head, not an apple. So enemy is standing on (9,7) without an apple there. So enemy is not eating an apple this turn. It might move to eat another apple. The nearest apple for enemy might be (8,9) or (6,6) or others. But (6,6) is also an apple we are considering. So there is potential competition for (6,6) if enemy moves towards it. However, enemy is at (9,7). To get to (6,6), it would take at least two moves: e.g., LEFT to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7), then DOWN to (7,6), etc. So not immediate.\n\nGiven that, maybe moving LEFT to (5,5) is safer because it moves us away from the right side where the enemy is, reducing the chance of future encounters.\n\nAlso, consider the board edges: At (5,5), we are not too close to any edge. At (6,6), we are a bit closer to the right edge (distance 3). Not a big deal.\n\nNow, we must also consider that moving LEFT to (5,5) means our head will be at (5,5) and our body will include (6,5) and (7,5). This creates a horizontal line to the right. If we later move RIGHT, we would hit our own body, so we cannot go back that way easily. But that's fine because we can go other directions.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,6), our body is at (6,5) and (7,5) forming an L shape. That might give more flexibility.\n\nActually, after moving UP, the body is vertical at (6,5) and horizontal at (7,5). That might allow more movement options later.\n\nLet's examine the potential for self-trapping. With length 3, it's still easy to maneuver.\n\nI think both moves are reasonable. However, we need to choose one.\n\nI recall that in Snake games, moving towards apples is generally good, but also consider that we should not move into a position where the enemy can easily head us off. The enemy is at (9,7). If we move to (6,6), we are still relatively close to the right side. If the enemy moves leftward, we might later conflict.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (6,6) and (5,5). If we take (5,5), we leave (6,6) for maybe later. If we take (6,6), we leave (5,5). Both are fine.\n\nBut there is also apple at (6,2) below. From (6,6), we can go down to (6,5) (but that's our body) so we can't go directly down. From (6,6), we can go down only after moving away. Actually from (6,6), down is (6,5) which is body, so not allowed. So to get to (6,2), we need to go left or right first then down. From (5,5), we can go down to (5,4) then further down to (5,3), etc., but not directly to (6,2) which is at x=6,y=2. Might be similar.\n\nGiven the symmetry, I need to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the apple at (2,6) cluster. From (5,5), we can go left to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then up to (3,6), then left to (2,6). That's a path. From (6,6), we can go left to (5,6), then left to (4,6), etc. Both can reach.\n\nOne more factor: The enemy might be targeting the apple at (8,9) or (0,9) etc. If we go to the left side, we avoid competition.\n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,5) is a good choice because it moves us towards the left cluster and away from the enemy.\n\nBut wait, what about the immediate safety? LEFT is safe as we checked.\n\nNow, we must also consider that moving LEFT to (5,5) might be moving into a position where the enemy could potentially move to (5,5) in the future? Unlikely given distance.\n\nAlso, we should consider the possibility of the enemy moving to (8,7) or (9,8). No threat.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nBut let's double-check: Is there any chance that moving UP to (6,6) could cause a head-on collision with the enemy if the enemy moves to (6,6) simultaneously? That's extremely unlikely because enemy would need to move three steps left and one down in one turn, which is impossible. So safe.\n\nThus, both are safe.\n\nI will go with LEFT to (5,5) to start heading toward the left side apple cluster.\n\nNow, for the final answer, we need to output just the direction.\n\nBut note: The user says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nSo we need to output only the direction. However, we can include our rationale before that, as long as the last line is the direction.\n\nWe have already included rationale in the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" section? Actually the instruction says we may write a long-term plan or strategy note to our future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to us as our last rationale on the next turn. So we can include a plan in our response before the final move line.\n\nBut the user also provided a format: They have \"--Your last move information--\" and we need to produce our move. The user expects us to output a response that includes our reasoning and then the move.\n\nLooking at the end of the user's message: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo we should include a plan. But note: The user also gave an example of \"START LAST RATIONALE\" and \"END LAST RATIONALE\". That might be part of the expected format? The user said: \"Your last move information: --\" and then showed \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" and \"END LAST MOVE PICK\". That seems like the format they used for their previous moves. Now they ask us to produce our move. It might be that we should output a similar structure.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the conversation: The user provided a \"Turn: 3 / 150\" and then asked for our move. They also showed our last move information with \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" etc. That is likely the format we should use for our response.\n\nThus, we should output:\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n[Our reasoning and plan]\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nAnd then the final move line? Actually the final line should be the direction word alone. But the format above already includes the direction in the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block. The user said: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" This suggests that after all the rationale, we should have a line with just the direction. But the previous format already has the direction inside the block. Possibly they want both: the structured block and then a final line with just the direction. However, in the example they gave (their last move information), they had \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" and \"END LAST MOVE PICK\" and then \"START LAST RATIONALE\" and \"END LAST RATIONALE\". And after that, they didn't have a final line with just the direction because that was their previous move. But now for our move, we need to output our decision.\n\nI think we should follow the same pattern: provide the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block with our move, then \"START LAST RATIONALE\" with our reasoning and plan, and then finally output the direction as a separate line? The instruction says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" So after our rationale, we need a line with just the word. That might be redundant with the pick block, but we can include both.\n\nTo be safe, I'll output:\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n[Our reasoning]\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT\n\nBut note: The user said \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" So the plan (rationale) should be before the final move line. The final move line is just the direction.\n\nThus, I'll include a short plan in the rationale.\n\nNow, let's craft the rationale.\n\nWe need to think hard and consider enemy snake and future moves.\n\nI'll write:\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn 3 analysis: My head at (6,5) with body at (7,5). Enemy at (9,7) with body at (9,6) and (9,5). Moving RIGHT is deadly (into my own body). Moving UP to (6,6) and LEFT to (5,5) both offer apples and are safe. Moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe but no apple.\n\nChoosing LEFT to (5,5) because:\n- It positions me toward the left side apple cluster (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,6), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9) and away from the enemy on the right, reducing collision risk.\n- After eating apple at (5,5), my body will be at (6,5) and (7,5). From (5,5), I have three escape directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) with UP and LEFT leading to apples (5,6) and (4,5). This keeps future options open.\n- The enemy likely moves toward the right-side apples (8,9) or stays central, so moving left minimizes early confrontation.\n- Eating now keeps pace with enemy (I have 1 apple, enemy has 2). We need to collect apples quickly to stay competitive.\n\nLong-term plan: From (5,5), aim to sweep leftward, collecting apples at (4,5), (2,6), etc., while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped by using edges and keeping an escape route. If enemy approaches, consider leading them into traps or using apples as bait.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT\n\nBut note: The user might expect only the final word after all that. I'll include the word as the final line.\n\nNow, ensure no extra text after the word.\n\nThus, my response will be as**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn 3 analysis: My head at (6,5) with body at (7,5). Enemy at (9,7) with body at (9,6) and (9,5). Moving RIGHT is deadly (into my own body). Moving UP to (6,6) and LEFT to (5,5) both offer apples and are safe. Moving DOWN to (6,4) is safe but no apple.\n\nChoosing LEFT to (5,5) because:\n- It positions me toward the left side apple cluster (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (1,6), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9) and away from the enemy on the right, reducing collision risk.\n- After eating apple at (5,5), my body will be at (6,5) and (7,5).

From (5,6) I can also go LEFT to (4,6) (empty) or UP to (5,7) (empty).

Actually (4,5) is not near any immediate apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe but leads away from all apples.\n\nThe best move is UP because it keeps me on a path to collect apples. The apple at (6,6) is still available and reachable in two moves (UP to (5,6), then RIGHT to (6,6)).

          "rationale": "After moving UP to (5,6) last turn, my body is now [(5,6) (head), (5,5), (6,5)]. I need to ensure I don't crash into my own body (specifically (5,5) or (6,5)). My tail is currently at (6,5).\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (5,6):\n1. **UP to (5,7)**: \n   - Is it safe? (5,7) is empty (board shows '.' at row7 col5).\n   - Is it backwards? My head is at (5,6), body is (5,5) -> (5,6). The cell behind my head is (5,5). (5,7) is not backwards.\n   - It's safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,5)**:\n   - (5,5) is occupied by my own body (the segment that was my neck). \n   - Moving here would be hitting myself.\n   - Dead.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,6)**:\n   - (4,6) is empty (row6 col4 is '.').\n   - Not backwards (backwards is (5,5)).\n   - Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,6)**:\n   - (6,6) is an apple ('A' at row6 col6).\n   - Moving here eats the apple. I will grow. Since I eat, my tail won't move this turn (my body length increases by 1).\n   - Is it safe? (6,6) is not occupied by a snake body currently. Enemy snake #1 is at (8,8) with body at (8,7), (9,7). (6,6) is far away.\n   - It is not backwards (backwards is (5,5)).\n   - It is safe, and beneficial.\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)** grabs an apple immediately. This puts me at 3 apples. \n  - From (6,6), I will be adjacent to apples at (6,2) (but blocked by my body or distance), (4,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). \n  - Specifically, from (6,6), the path to the left cluster is open: (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (2,6) is 4 moves, but (2,6) is an apple. However, (5,6) will be occupied by my body if I grow (since I don't move tail). Wait, let's trace:\n    - Current: H(5,6), B1(5,5), T(6,5).\n    - Move RIGHT to (6,6):\n      - New H(6,6)\n      - Old H(5,6) becomes body.\n      - Old B1(5,5) becomes body.\n      - Old T(6,5) becomes body.\n      - Since I ate an apple, I do *not* remove the tail.\n      - New Body: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5)].\n    - From (6,6), I can go LEFT to (5,6). Is (5,6) safe? (5,6) will be occupied by my own body segment (the old head). If I go LEFT, I move into (5,6), which will be occupied at the end of the turn. **I cannot go LEFT next turn if I go RIGHT this turn.**\n    - From (6,6), I can go UP to (6,7). (6,7) is empty. Safe.\n    - From (6,6), I can go DOWN to (6,5). (6,5) will be occupied by my body (the old tail). Unsafe.\n    - From (6,6), I can go RIGHT to (7,6). (7,6) is empty. Safe.\n    - So, if I go RIGHT, my next turn options are UP or RIGHT. I am blocked LEFT and DOWN. I am essentially moving East.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**:\n  - Moves me away from the apple at (6,6) but closer to the left cluster (2,6, 2,7, 2,8).\n  - From (4,6), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (back to 5,6).\n  - This maintains flexibility.\n\n- **UP to (5,7)**:\n  - Moves me up, away from the left cluster but keeping central.\n  - From (5,7), I can go to (5,8) (empty), (4,7) (empty), (6,7) (empty). \n  - This is also flexible.\n\nComparison:\n- The apple at (6,6) is immediate and safe. Eating it increases score and length.\n- While eating it restricts my movement (blocking left and down), I still have 2 options (UP and RIGHT).\n- The left cluster is promising, but (6,6) is currently the most accessible apple. The apples at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are further away and require navigating through (4,6), (3,6), etc.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (8,8). If I take (6,6), I am moving towards the right side, potentially getting closer to the enemy. However, the enemy is currently moving around the top right corner. If I stay on the left side (4,6), I am away from the enemy.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am at (6,6). The enemy is at (8,8). They are 2 cells away in X and 2 cells away in Y. They could move towards me (e.g., LEFT to 7,8 or DOWN to 8,7). If they move DOWN to (8,7), distance is (2,1). If they move LEFT to (7,8), distance is (1,2). We are not close enough for immediate head-on collision next turn unless they make a very specific move. \n- However, (6,6) puts me on the \"right side\" of the board. The enemy owns the top-right corner. It might be better to stay on the left side (go LEFT or UP) to avoid conflict.\n- The apple at (6,6) is valuable, but survival is more valuable.\n\nLet's reconsider the body constraint.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,6):\n- I cannot go LEFT or DOWN next turn.\n- I will be at (6,6). The board at (6,6) becomes my head.\n- The area around (6,6) is:\n  - (5,6): Will be my body.\n  - (6,5): Will be my body.\n  - (6,7): Empty.\n  - (7,6): Empty.\n- I am not trapped. I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4,6):\n- I am safe.\n- I am further from the enemy.\n- I am closer to the left cluster.\n\nGiven the enemy is at (8,8), engaging in the right side might force a confrontation. The left side is quieter. The apple at (6,6) is a \"trap\" apple? It's not a trap, but it leads me towards the enemy's territory.\n\nHowever, looking at the board, (6,6) is the only apple on the right side in my vicinity. The rest are on the left (x=0,1,2) or bottom-right (x=7,8). \nIf I take (6,6), I get a point. \nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I start the journey to the cluster at (2,6). \n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nEnemy at (8,8). Body at (8,7), (9,7).\nApples near enemy: (8,9), (9,9) is empty, (7,2), (8,2).\nThey will likely go for (8,9) or (6,6)? No, (6,6) is far for them.\nThey might go UP to (8,9) (apple). \nIf they go UP, they grow and lengthen their body towards (8,7). \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am at (6,6). They are at (8,9). Safe distance.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (4,6), I am at (4,6).\nFrom (4,6), I can go to (3,6), then (2,6).\n(2,6) is an apple.\n(2,7) is an apple.\n(2,8) is an apple.\nThis is a dense cluster.\n\nThe distance from (5,6) to (2,6) is 3 moves.\nThe distance from (5,6) to (6,6) is 1 move.\nThe distance from (5,6) to (4,6) is 1 move.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I am closer to the cluster.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am further from the cluster.\n\nIs (6,6) safe from the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (8,8). \nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7,8), they are at (7,8). I am at (6,6). Distance = 2 in X, 2 in Y.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8,7), they are at (8,7). I am at (6,6). Distance = 2 in X, 1 in Y.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (8,9), distance = 2 in X, 3 in Y.\nIt is safe.\n\nHowever, occupying the right side puts me closer to the enemy's potential future moves. The enemy might circle around. \nOn a 10x10 board, staying in the center or left side is generally safer against a top-right enemy.\n\nLet's evaluate **LEFT** to (4,6) vs **UP** to (5,7).\n- LEFT to (4,6): Moves towards the apple cluster. (4,6) is empty. From (4,6), I can go LEFT to (3,6) -> (2,6). This seems like a good path. (3,6) is empty. (2,6) is an apple.\n- UP to (5,7): Moves me up. (5,7) is empty. From (5,7), I can go UP to (5,8) -> (5,9). (5,9) is empty. Or LEFT to (4,7). Or RIGHT to (6,7). This keeps me central but not immediately grabbing an apple.\n\nThe apples at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are a \"food source\". Getting there first is good.\nThe apple at (6,6) is a single apple on the right.\nThe apple at (0,9), (0,5) are on the far left.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I am on track for the (2,x) apples.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I eat one apple but move away from the cluster.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,8). They are likely to chase apples in their quadrant or center. \nThe apples at (2,6) etc. are far from them. \nThe apples at (6,6) is closer to them than to me? No, I am at (5,6). They are at (8,8). I am closer.\nDistance from me (5,6) to (6,6): 1.\nDistance from enemy (8,8) to (6,6): |8-6| + |8-6| = 4. \nI am much closer.\n\nIf I take (6,6), I secure a point immediately and deny it to the enemy (though they are far). \nBut if I go LEFT, I start the journey to the cluster.\n\nLet's consider the body mechanics.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6):\n- New Head: (4,6)\n- Old Head: (5,6)\n- Old Body: (5,5), (6,5)\n- Tail moves forward: (6,5) becomes (5,5).\n- New Body: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)].\n- From (4,6), I can go LEFT to (3,6). Is (3,6) safe? Yes.\n- From (3,6), I can go LEFT to (2,6) (apple).\n- This path is clear.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6):\n- New Head: (6,6)\n- Old Head: (5,6)\n- Old Body: (5,5), (6,5)\n- Tail moves: (6,5) -> (5,5).\n- Since I eat an apple, the tail does NOT move.\n- New Body: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5)].\n- From (6,6), I am blocked LEFT (5,6) and DOWN (6,5).\n- My options are UP (6,7) or RIGHT (7,6).\n- UP (6,7) is empty. RIGHT (7,6) is empty.\n- If I go UP to (6,7), I am moving away from the board center slightly, but (6,7) is empty.\n- From (6,7), I can go UP to (6,8) (empty? row8 col6 is '.'), or LEFT to (5,7) (empty), or RIGHT to (7,7) (empty? row7 col7 is '.'), or DOWN to (6,6) (my body).\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,6), from (7,6) I can go to (8,6) (empty? row6 col8 is '.'), (7,5) (empty), (7,7) (empty).\n- The path UP from (6,6) leads towards (6,8), (6,9). (6,9) is empty. No apples up there.\n- The path RIGHT from (6,6) leads to (8,6), (8,5), etc. There are apples at (8,2), (7,2). But going that way takes me deeper into the right side, closer to the enemy who is at (8,8).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I move towards the left cluster. The left side is much safer because the enemy is on the right.\nThe apples at (0,9), (0,5), (2,0) are on the left/bottom left.\nThe enemy is at top right.\nIt is strategically much better to be on the left side.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6), I am committing to the right side.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I am committing to the left side.\nGiven the enemy's position (8,8), the left side is the winning territory.\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT to (4,6) to start claiming the left side apples.\n\nLet's double check the safety of (4,6).\nBoard state shows (4,6) is '.' (empty).\nMy body is at (5,5), (6,5). (4,6) is not occupied.\nEnemy body is at (8,7), (9,7). (4,6) is far.\nEnemy head is at (8,8). (4,6) is far.\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision?\nEnemy is at (8,8). They can move to (8,9), (7,8), (8,7).\nI am at (5,6). I move to (4,6).\nNo overlap possible.\n\nWhat if I stay at (5,6) and move UP to (5,7)?\n(5,7) is safe. But it doesn't get me an apple. It keeps me central.\nBut if I want to go left, I should turn left now. If I go UP to (5,7), I am at y=7. To get to (2,6), I have to go DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,6)... it's a loop.\nGoing directly LEFT to (4,6) is the most efficient route to the left cluster.\n\nThe only apple \"on the way\" to the left cluster from (4,6) is (2,6).\n(2,7) and (2,8) are above (2,6).\n(0,9) is far corner.\n(0,5) is below (2,5).\n(2,0) is bottom.\n\nI will prioritize the cluster (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n\nOne concern: The body tail is at (6,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6):\nHead moves to (4,6).\nBody becomes (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (5,5).\nTail (6,5) moves to (5,5)? No, wait.\nHead: (5,6) -> (4,6)\nBody segment 1: (5,5) -> (5,6)\nBody segment 2: (6,5) -> (5,5)\nTail (which is segment 2) moves to (5,5).\nSo the tail moves from (6,5) to (5,5).\n(5,5) was previously occupied by the body segment 1.\nSo the old tail position (6,5) becomes empty.\nThis is standard snake movement.\n\nSo from (4,6), the board state is:\n- Head (4,6)\n- Body (5,6)\n- Body (5,5)\n- (6,5) is now empty.\nI can go LEFT to (3,6). (3,6) is empty.\nI can go UP to (4,7). (4,7) is empty.\nI can go DOWN to (4,5). (4,5) is empty.\nI can go RIGHT to (5,6) -> into my own body. Dead.\nSo I have 3 safe moves from (4,6). This is good.\n\nIf I went RIGHT to (6,6):\nHead (6,6)\nBody (5,6)\nBody (5,5)\nBody (6,5)\nTail (6,5) does NOT move (growth).\nFrom (6,6), safe moves: UP (6,7), RIGHT (7,6). 2 safe moves.\n(5,6) is body. (6,5) is body.\n(6,6) is a tighter space.\n\nGiven the long-term goal of controlling the left side and avoiding the enemy on the right, LEFT is the superior move.\n\nFinal check for immediate death:\n- Off board? (4,6) is x=4, y=6. Inside [0,9].\n- Into own body? (4,6) is not (5,5) or (6,5) or (5,6).\n- Into enemy body? Enemy is at (8,8) range. (4,6) is far.\n- Into enemy head? No.\n- Backwards? Backwards from (5,6) is (5,5). (4,6) is not (5,5).\n\nMove is safe.\n\nThe only alternative to LEFT is UP or DOWN or RIGHT.\nRIGHT is risky due to enemy proximity.\nUP is passive.\nDOWN leads to (5,5) (death) or (5,4) if I turn, but I can't turn 180.\nActually, from (5,6), DOWN is (5,5) which is death.\nSo DOWN is impossible.\nLEFT or UP or RIGHT.\nLEFT gets me closer to the objective (left side apples).\nUP keeps me central but doesn't secure an apple immediately.\nRIGHT secures an apple but moves me towards enemy.\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nTo reiterate the strategy for the next turn (Plan):\nMove LEFT to (4,6). From there, proceed towards the apple cluster at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). Avoid the enemy on the right side.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is at (8,8). If they move DOWN to (8,7), they might block their own path or approach the center. But (8,7) is already occupied by their body? No, their body is (8,7) and (9,7).\nWait, enemy body is [(8,7), (9,7)].\nHead is (8,8).\nSo their body is directly below their head (8,7) and to the right (9,7).\nThis means they are in a corner-like shape.\nIf they move DOWN to (8,7), they hit their own body. So they cannot move DOWN.\nThey can move UP to (8,9) (Apple), LEFT to (7,8) (Empty), or RIGHT to (9,8) (Empty? row8 col9 is '.'? Board row8: \". . A . . . . . 1 .\" -> indices 0-9. Index 8 is '1' (head). Index 9 is '.'.\nSo they can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nIf they go UP, they eat (8,9).\nIf they go LEFT, they go to (7,8).\nIf they go RIGHT, they go to (9,8).\n\nRegardless, (4,6) is safe.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turn: Move to (4,6). From there, head towards the apple at (2,6). Keep an eye on the enemy who is likely moving UP or LEFT.\n\nOne final check: Are there any apples closer than (2,6) that I should prioritize?\n(6,6) is 1 move away (RIGHT). I rejected it.\n(4,5) is empty.\n(5,6) is empty? No, it's my head.\n(5,7) is empty.\n(6,5) is my tail.\nNo other apples are adjacent to me.\n\nSo (2,6) is the next target via (4,6).\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (4,6), can I reach (2,6) in 2 moves?\n(4,6) -> (3,6) -> (2,6). Yes.\nIs (3,6) safe?\n(3,6) is empty on the board.\nIs (2,6) safe?\n(2,6) is an apple. It's not occupied by a snake.\n\nSo the path is clear.\n\nI will execute LEFT.\n\nOne minor risk: The enemy might predict my move to the left and try to cut me off? No, they are too far away.\n\nI will generate the move LEFT.\n\nWait, I should consider if the enemy could move to (7,6) or similar and block my path if I go right, but since I'm going left, it's irrelevant.\n\nThe plan is solid.\n\nFinal check on the rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy body is (5,5), (6,5).\nBackwards from (5,6) is (5,5).\n(4,6) is not backwards. Correct.\n\nI will output LEFT.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.\"\nMy body is at (5,5), (6,5).\nEnemy body is at (8,7), (9,7).\n(4,6) is safe from both.\n\nThe prompt says \"Be constantly aware of the enemy snake and be making plans to outwit him and outlast him.\"\nMoving to the left side outlasts him by avoiding conflict and securing resources.\n\nI am confident in LEFT.\n\nOne last check on the board state provided in the prompt:\n```\n 9 A . . . . . . . A .\n 8 . . A . . . . . 1 .\n 7 . . A . . . . . T T\n 6 . A A . . 0 A . . .\n 5 A . . . A T T . . .\n ...\n```\nWait, in the board state provided in the prompt (the image-like text):\nRow 6: `. A A . . 0 A . . .`\nCoordinates: (0,6) is '.', (1,6) is 'A', (2,6) is 'A', (3,6) '.', (4,6) '.', (5,6) '0', (6,6) 'A'...\nSo (4,6) is indeed '.' (empty).\n(3,6) is '.'.\n(2,6) is 'A'.\n\nThe prompt also lists apples at:\n(1, 6), (0, 9), (0, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1), (6, 2), (2, 7), (8, 9), (6, 6), (2, 0), (7, 2), (2, 6), (4, 5), (0, 5), (8, 2)\nNote: (4, 5) is listed as an apple!\nWait, looking at the board state row 5: `5 A . . . A T T . . .`\n(0,5) is A.\n(4,5) is '.' (the 5th character, index 4).\nThe list says (4, 5) is an apple.\nThere is a discrepancy between the text board and the list.\nThe text board shows (4,5) as '.'.\nThe list shows (4,5) as an apple.\nWhich one is correct?\nUsually, the list is authoritative for coordinates, but the board is the visual representation.\nHowever, the board might be slightly simplified or the apple might be hidden.\nIf (4,5) is an apple, then from (5,6), I could go DOWN to (5,5) (death).\nI cannot go to (4,5) directly from (5,6).\nI would have to go LEFT to (4,6), then DOWN to (4,5).\nThis makes (4,5) a target for the turn after next.\nThis reinforces the decision to go LEFT to (4,6), as (4,5) is an apple and is adjacent to (4,6).\nIf (4,5) is indeed an apple, then (4,6) is even better.\n\nLet's trust the list.\nApples: (4, 5) is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I am above the apple at (4,5).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (4,5) to eat it.\nThis is a great move sequence.\n\nSo, LEFT -> (4,6) -> (4,5) (Apple).\nThis is better than going for (2,6).\n(4,5) is closer.\nDistance to (4,5) is 2 moves (Left then Down).\nDistance to (2,6) is 2 moves (Left then Left).\nBoth are 2 moves.\n(4,5) is an apple. (2,6) is also an apple.\n(4,5) is slightly safer because it's closer to my current position and I don't have to cross (3,6) (though 3,6 is empty).\nAlso, (4,5) is at y=5. (2,6) is at y=6.\n(4,5) allows me to stay at y=5 or go to y=4.\nThere are apples at (0,4), (2,1) at lower y.\n(2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are higher y.\nGoing to (4,5) keeps me in the lower-middle area.\nGoing to (2,6) moves me to the upper-left area.\nThe enemy is at (8,8) (upper right).\nBoth left-side areas are safe.\n\nIf (4,5) is an apple, then LEFT is definitely the move.\nI will proceed with LEFT.\n\nOne final check on the board discrepancy.\nThe board provided in the prompt is:\nRow 5: `5 A . . . A T T . . .`\nIndices: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:T, 7:T...\nWait, `A . . . . A`\n0: A\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: .\n5: A\nSo (4,5) is '.'.\nBut the list says (4,5) is an apple.\nThis is a conflict.\nIn Snake games, the list of apples is usually the ground truth.\nHowever, the visual board is also ground truth.\nIt is possible that the list is slightly inaccurate or I am misinterpreting the board string.\n\"5 A . . . A T T . . .\" \nLet's count the characters.\n1. '5'\n2. ' '\n3. 'A' (x=0)\n4. ' ' (x=1)\n5. '.' (x=2)\n6. ' ' (x=3)\n7. '.' (x=4)\n8. ' ' (x=5)\n9. '.' (x=6)\n10. ' ' (x=7)\n11. 'A' (x=8)\n12. ' ' (x=9)\n13. 'T' (x=10? No, coordinates are 0-9)\nWait, the string \"5 A . . . A T T . . .\" has a specific format.\nLet's look at the coordinates.\nRow 5.\n(0,5) -> board string char after \"5 \" -> 'A'. Matches list (0,5).\n(1,5) -> ' '. Matches.\n(2,5) -> '.'. Matches.\n(3,5) -> ' '. Matches.\n(4,5) -> '.'. Matches.\n(5,5) -> ' '. Matches.\n(6,5) -> 'A'. Wait.\nThe string is \"5 A . . . A T T . . .\"\nIndices: 0:'5', 1:' ', 2:'A', 3:' ', 4:'.', 5:' ', 6:'.', 7:' ', 8:'.', 9:' ', 10:'A', 11:' ', 12:'T', 13:' ', 14:'T', ...\nThis is very confusing. The spaces might be separators or part of the grid.\nLooking at row 6: \"6 . A A . . 0 A . . .\"\n(0,6): '.'\n(1,6): 'A'\n(2,6): 'A'\n(3,6): '.'\n(4,6): '.'\n(5,6): '0' (My head)\n(6,6): 'A'\nThis matches the list: (6,6) is an apple.\nSo the board visualization seems reliable.\nThe list says (4,5) is an apple.\nThe board says (4,5) is '.'.\nI will trust the board visualization for the immediate state, as the list might be a set of all apples that might have been eaten or are currently on the board.\nHowever, the prompt says \"Apples at: ...\". This usually implies current apples.\nIf the board shows '.' and the list shows 'A', I should be cautious.\nIf (4,5) is NOT an apple, then going to (4,6) leads to (4,5) which is empty.\nBut (2,6) IS an apple (board shows 'A' at (2,6)).\nSo (2,6) is definitely an apple.\n(6,6) is definitely an apple (board shows 'A').\n(4,5) is ambiguous.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6), I am safe.\nIf (4,5) is an apple, I eat it next turn.\nIf (4,5) is empty, I can still go to (2,6).\nSo LEFT is safe regardless.\n\nCompare RIGHT to (6,6).\n(6,6) is confirmed apple on board.\nRIGHT gets me a guaranteed apple now.\nLEFT gets me to a position where I can get an apple next turn (either (4,5) if it exists, or (2,6)).\nRIGHT: Score +1 immediately. Position (6,6). Blocked LEFT/DOWN.\nLEFT: Score 0 immediately. Position (4,6). 3 safe moves. Next turn potential apple.\n\nIs the immediate apple worth the restricted movement and moving towards the enemy?\nYes, usually, but given the enemy is on the right, moving left is better for survival.\nIf I move RIGHT, I am at (6,6). The enemy is at (8,8).\nThe enemy might go to (7,8) or (8,9).\nI am not in immediate danger.\nBut I am entering their territory.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I am entering the \"safe zone\".\n\nI will stick with LEFT.\n\nWhy? Because (4,6) is a pivot point.\nFrom (4,6), I can access (4,5), (2,6), (0,5), (0,4).\nFrom (6,6), I can access (6,2), (8,2), (7,2) on the bottom right, and (8,9) on top right.\nThe bottom right apples (7,2), (8,2) are close to the enemy's start (9,7)? No, enemy is at 8,8.\n(8,2) is far from (8,8).\nBut (6,6) is close to (8,8).\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nI will write the plan.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (4,6) to secure a position in the safe left sector. From there, I will target the apple cluster at (2,6) or the potential apple at (4,5). This avoids confrontation with the enemy snake currently occupying the top-right quadrant.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nOne last check: Is there any reason to go UP to (5,7)?\n(5,7) is empty.\nFrom (5,7), I can go to (5,8) (empty), (4,7) (empty), (6,7) (empty).\nThis keeps me central.\nBut I am not grabbing an apple.\nAnd I am closer to the enemy at (8,8) than if I were at (4,6).\n(5,7) vs (4,6):\nDistance to enemy (8,8):\n(5,7): |8-5| + |8-7| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n(4,6): |8-4| + |8-6| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n(4,6) is further away. Better.\n\nConclusion: LEFT is the best move.\n\nThe final line will be LEFT.LEFT",

The options were UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), and RIGHT (5,6).\n\n- **UP (4,7)**: The cell is empty. However, it moves me towards the enemy snake at (8,8) (distance 5.8) and away from the dense apple cluster at (2,6)-(2,8) on the left side. While safe, it doesn't maximize apple potential.\n- **DOWN (4,5)**: The board state at turn 5 indicated an apple at (4,5). If I move here, I eat an apple, grow, and increase my score. This is highly desirable.\n- **LEFT (3,6)**: The cell is empty. It moves me towards the left-side apple cluster (2,6, 2,7, 2,8). This is a safe strategic move to secure multiple future points.\n- **RIGHT (5,6)**: This is the path I came from. Moving here would immediately hit my own body (the segment at (5,6) is currently my body, as the tail moved to (6,5) on the previous turn). Moving backwards results in death.\n\n**Decision**: **DOWN** to (4,5) is the optimal move. It guarantees an apple consumption immediately (increasing score to 3) while keeping me in a relatively safe position. The cell (4,5) is confirmed safe (empty) based on the board state. Moving down avoids the immediate risk of moving into the enemy's proximity (compared to UP) and avoids the empty/emptying space of LEFT (though LEFT is strategically good, DOWN provides an immediate point).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

From (6,8) I will still have several viable follow\u2011up directions (up, down, left) while staying away from my own tail. Moving DOWN would restrict future options to essentially only further down, limiting flexibility and moving away from readily reachable apples.\n\nPlan: go left to claim the (2,8) apple cluster while preserving multiple safe follow\u2011up moves and staying clear of collisions.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**Reasoning for Turn 8:**\n\n1.  **Current State Analysis:**\n    *   My head is at (3,5). My body follows at (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).\n    *   Apples: There is a dense cluster of apples to my left and up: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), and also (0,5), (0,4), (0,9).\n    *   Enemy snake #1: Head at (7,8). Body segments at (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7). The enemy is to the right and slightly down.\n    *   Board state check: (2,5) is empty ('.').\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves:**\n    *   **UP (3,6):** The cell (3,6) is listed as an apple. However, checking the board state for Row 6 (`6 . A A A T T A . . .`), the character at x=3 is 'A', but wait. The input says `Apples at: ... (3, 6) ... (2, 6) ...`. The board visualization shows `A` at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)? No, let's look closely at Row 6: `6 . A A A T T A . . .`.\n        *   x=0: .\n        *   x=1: A\n        *   x=2: A\n        *   x=3: A\n        *   x=4: T (My body segment (4,6))\n        *   x=5: T (My body segment (5,6))\n        *   x=6: A\n        *   x=7-9: .\n        So (3,6) is indeed an 'A'. However, I must check if it's safe. If I move UP to (3,6), I eat the apple and grow. My new tail will remain at (5,6) (unless I eat, actually I grow, so the tail stays at (5,6)? No, when I eat, I don't remove the tail, so my body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)].\n    *   **LEFT (2,5):** The cell (2,5) is empty ('.' in row 5). This moves me closer to the apple cluster at (2,6), (2,7), (2,8).\n    *   **DOWN (3,4):** The cell (3,4) is empty (Row 4: `4 A . . . . . . . . .`). x=3 is '.'.\n    *   **RIGHT (4,5):** This is my own body segment. Invalid move (suicide).\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Avoiding Traps:** Moving UP to (3,6) seems attractive because it's an apple. However, consider the geometry. If I go UP to (3,6), my body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]. I am effectively blocking the path between (2,6) and (3,6).\n    *   If I move UP to (3,6) and eat, my head is at (3,6). My body is at (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,5), my head is at (2,5). My body becomes [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)].\n    *   **Comparing (3,6) vs (2,5):**\n        *   From (2,5), I have immediate access to (2,6) (up) and (1,5) (left). (1,5) is an apple. (2,6) is an apple.\n        *   From (3,6), I have access to (3,7) (up), (2,6) (left). (3,7) is empty. (2,6) is an apple.\n    *   **Risk Analysis:** Moving UP to (3,6) puts my head right next to the wall at x=3. Moving LEFT to (2,5) keeps me more central and closer to the cluster at (2,6)-(2,8). Also, from (2,5), I can eventually reach the apples on the left edge (0,4), (0,5), (0,9).\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (7,8). They are far away. They are likely targeting the apples at (6,6), (8,2), or (7,2). They are not an immediate threat to (2,5) or (3,6).\n    *   **Why LEFT is better than UP:** If I go UP to (3,6), I am slightly more constrained by the wall. If I go LEFT to (2,5), I open up a path to the left side of the board where there are many apples. The apples at (2,6) and (2,7) are easily accessible from (2,5). (2,5) is also safer as it is not adjacent to the enemy's potential trajectory (which is likely to stay right/center).\n    *   **Final Decision:** LEFT to (2,5) positions me to dominate the left side of the board and collect the cluster of apples there (2,6, 2,7, 2,8, 1,6, 0,4, 0,5, 0,9). It is a safer, more strategic expansion than going directly for the single apple at (3,6) which slightly encloses me.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (2,5) to secure the left side apple cluster (2,6, 2,7, 2,8). From there, navigate to (1,6) and eventually (0,4)/(0,5) to maximize score while keeping distance from the enemy on the right.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
