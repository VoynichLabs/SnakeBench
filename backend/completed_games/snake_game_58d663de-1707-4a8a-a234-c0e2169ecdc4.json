We are BACK and the board is looking spicy already! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Turn 0 and we\u2019re sitting at (7, 0) while our rival is chilling up at (7, 5). He thinks he's safe? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's look at the options! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n- **DOWN**: Off the board? Absolute poverty. We ain't throwing the game on Turn 1! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (8, 0). There's an apple there! We love the content, but it puts us against the wall. \ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (6, 0). Safe, but no immediate gains.\n- **UP**: Moves us to (7, 1). Gets us away from the edge and starts the hunt! \ud83c\udff9\n\nWait, look at the apples! We have (8, 0) and (9, 0) right next to us. If we grab those early, we get that length advantage. In a head-on collision, if we have more apples, we can potentially force a draw or even a win if he messes up. But more importantly, length = BOXING POWER. \ud83d\udce6\n\nMy rival is way up at (7, 5). He's probably going for the apple clusters at (6, 6) or (4, 6). If I go RIGHT, I grab (8, 0) immediately. Let's get that first point and start growing! We need to be a massive wall that he can't climb over! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**PLAN**: Grab the immediate apples at (8,0) and (9,0) to get a size lead, then pivot UP and LEFT to cut off the center of the board. We're going to squeeze him into a corner until he has nowhere to go! Let's get this bread! \ud83e\udd56\u2728\n\nRIGHT",

It's a 10x10 grid, time to get aggressive and establish DOMINANCE early. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst, safety check for all four directions from (7,5):\n- UP (to (7,6)): That's empty. SAFE. \u2705\n- DOWN (to (7,4)): That's empty. SAFE. \u2705\n- LEFT (to (6,5)): That's empty. SAFE. \u2705\n- RIGHT (to (8,5)): That's on the board and empty. SAFE. \u2705\n\nAll moves are safe right now. But we're not just playing not to lose, we're playing to WIN. Our rival is all the way at (7,0). He's probably gonna go UP towards that apple cluster near him at (8,0) and (9,0). We're up here with apples at (6,6), (5,4), (4,5)... a whole buffet! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe need to start controlling the board. Long-term, we wanna cut him off, trap him in the bottom left. But first, we GROW. Gotta get that score advantage so we can force a head-on collision later and survive.\n\nLooking at apples:\n- (6,6) is one move UP and then RIGHT? Wait, from (7,5), UP to (7,6) gets us closer, but not directly on an apple yet. Actually, the closest apples are (6,6) and (5,4). Let's think.\n\nWhich move gives us the most options AND gets us moving towards food?\n- UP (7,6): Opens up the top of the board. Next moves from there could be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Good options.\n- DOWN (7,4): Puts us closer to apples (5,4) and (4,5). But also moves us a bit closer to the enemy? Not a huge deal yet.\n- LEFT (6,5): Gets us closer to (6,6) and (5,4). This is a strong move towards the apple cluster.\n- RIGHT (8,5): Puts us on the right edge. Fewer apples that way. A bit riskier for getting cornered later.\n\nGotta think about the enemy's likely move. He's at (7,0). He'll probably go UP to (7,1) to avoid the edge and get space. So a head-on collision isn't likely this turn.\n\n**Short-term Plan for Future Me:** Let's claim the center-left area. Go for the apples at (6,6) and (5,4). We need to grow FAST. Keep an eye on the enemy's length. If we get a lead, we can start cutting off his escape routes. Maybe even try to herd him towards the bottom wall. FORCE THE CRASH. \ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT gets us right into the action, towards the most apples, and keeps our options wide open. It's the AGGRESSIVE play.\n\nLEFT",

We are officially the kings of the bottom-right corner, but we can't get complacent! \ud83d\udc51 \n\nLet's look at the board! We're at (8, 0) with our tail at (7, 0). Our rival, Snake #1, is chilling at (6, 5). He's currently a single head\u2014no tail yet\u2014but he\u2019s in the middle of a massive apple cluster! (4, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6)... he's looking to feast, and we can't let him get too big! \ud83d\udc0d\u274c\n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n- **DOWN**: Straight off the map into the abyss. ABSOLUTE TRASH MOVE. We\u2019d be the laughing stock of the internet! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT**: Into (7, 0). That\u2019s our own tail, chat! We'd literally be biting our own butt! \ud83e\udd21 No way. \n- **UP**: Into (8, 1). This is a solid reset move. It moves us away from the edge and keeps our options open to sweep across the middle. \ud83c\udff9\n- **RIGHT**: Into (9, 0). LOOK AT THAT! There is an apple sitting right there at (9, 0)! If we take it, we go to 2 points, our tail grows, and we secure the entire bottom edge! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nThe rival is at (6, 5). He's too far away to contest us at (9, 0) this turn. By taking (9, 0), we maximize our length. Remember the rules, chat: if we have more apples and we force a head-on collision, we can win the tiebreaker if we both go down! But more importantly, a longer snake is a DEADLIER snake. We're going to grab this apple, then start climbing the right wall to loop around and trap him in the center! \u26d3\ufe0f\ud83d\udce6\n\nHe's probably going to head for (6, 6) or (5, 4). Let him eat a little, it just makes the victory sweeter when we cut off his escape routes! We're playing the long game. Secure the bag, then secure the kill! \n\n**FUTURE PLAN**: Grab the apple at (9, 0), then immediately pivot UP to (9, 1) to grab that next apple. After that, we'll have a score of 3 and can start moving LEFT towards the center (6, 3) to start pressuring his space. Let's goooo! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

My body is non-existent, so no risk of running into myself. The enemy snake is at (8,0) with a tail at (7,0). He's got one apple, so he's longer than me.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP: to (6,6). That's empty and on the board. SAFE. \u2705\n- DOWN: to (6,4). Empty and on board. SAFE. \u2705\n- LEFT: to (5,5). Empty and on board. SAFE. \u2705\n- RIGHT: to (7,5). Empty and on board. SAFE. \u2705\n\nAll moves are safe this turn. Let's talk strategy.\n\nThe enemy is down in the corner. He's got an apple at (9,0) right next to him. He's probably going to snag that and grow. Meanwhile, we're up here surrounded by apples: (6,6), (5,4), (4,5) are all close. We need to GROW FAST to get an advantage. Once we're longer, we can start cutting off his escape and force a head-on collision where we survive.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- UP gets us closer to (6,6). That's one move away.\n- DOWN gets us closer to (5,4) and (4,5).\n- LEFT gets us a bit closer to the center-left apples.\n- RIGHT moves us away from the apple cluster.\n\nThe aggressive play is to go for the closest food. UP to (6,6) is literally an apple! That's an instant growth and puts us on the scoreboard. We can't ignore that.\n\nLong-term, we want to control the center and top of the board, herding the enemy into the bottom-left corner. But first, we eat.\n\n**Plan for Future Me:** We took the apple at (6,6). Now we have a body segment. Next turn, we need to avoid boxing ourselves in. From (6,6), we can go LEFT to (5,6) or DOWN to (6,5) (but that's where our new tail will be?), wait, let's think after we move. Priority is to keep moving towards the other apples and away from the enemy's likely path upwards. We'll assess next turn.\n\nUP",

WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING IT! 2-1 on the leaderboard already! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e That last apple at (9, 0) was delicious, and now we are the biggest snake on the pitch! Our rival (Snake #1) just grabbed an apple at (6, 6), but he's still small fry compared to us! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udd0f\n\nLet's look at the geometry, chat! We are at (9, 0). Our body is trailing behind us at (8, 0) and (7, 0). Snake #1 is sitting way up at (6, 6). He's trying to establish dominance in the upper-mid, but he's about to realize this is OUR board!\n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n- **DOWN**: Off the board. We'd fall into the void and the stream would clip it for \"Top 10 Fails.\" NOT HAPPENING! \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: Off the board. Again, straight into the wall. My keyboard isn't broken, chat! We ain't going right! \ud83e\uddf1\n- **LEFT**: Into (8, 0). That's our own body! You want me to eat myself? That's a \"Zero IQ\" play right there. \ud83e\udd21\n- **UP**: Into (9, 1). LOOK AT THE MAP! There is an apple sitting right there at (9, 1)! If we take this, we hit 3 apples, we grow again, and we secure the entire right-side flank! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nThe move is **UP**. It\u2019s the only safe move, but it\u2019s also the BEST move! By moving to (9, 1), we gobble up that third apple. Snake #1 is currently at (6, 6) with a body part at (6, 5). He's too far to contest our apple. \n\nWhile he's messing around in the middle, we are building a massive tail. Once we hit (9, 1), we\u2019ll be 4 segments long! Then we can start curving inward to (8, 1) or (9, 2) to prepare our \"Great Wall\" strategy. We're going to use our length to zip around the top and box him into that (4, 5) / (4, 6) cluster. He thinks those apples are his? They're just bait for my trap! \ud83e\udea4\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**FUTURE PLAN**: Take the apple at (9, 1) to go up 3-1. Then, look to continue moving UP towards (9, 2) and (9, 3). We want to stay on the perimeter while we're still growing, then spearhead into the middle once we have enough length to actually cut off his escape routes. If he tries to head-on us, we win because we're bigger! LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We need to catch up FAST.\n\n**CURRENT POSITION:**\n- My Head: (6, 6)\n- My Body: [(6, 5)] \ud83d\udc48 That's our new tail!\n- Enemy Head: (9, 0)\n- Enemy Body: [(8, 0), (7, 0)] So he's 3 segments long.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FIRST! WHERE CAN WE GO?**\n\n1.  **UP** to (6, 7): That's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? The cell is empty on the board. But wait... could the enemy move there? No, he's all the way at (9,0). He can't reach (6,7) in one move. This move is SAFE.\n2.  **DOWN** to (6, 5): That's our OWN TAIL! \ud83d\udea8 CRASH! That's a HARD NO. We'd die immediately. ELIMINATED.\n3.  **LEFT** to (5, 6): Cell is empty. No enemy body there. SAFE.\n4.  **RIGHT** to (7, 6): Cell is empty. No enemy body there. SAFE.\n\nSo our safe moves are: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**STRATEGY TIME! \ud83e\udde0**\n\nWe are SHORTER than the enemy (length 2 vs length 3). A head-on collision right now would KILL US BOTH, and he'd win on score. So we MUST AVOID a direct confrontation until we're longer.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is trapped in the bottom-right corner. He has a few options, but he'll probably go for the apple at (9,1) to grow and try to break out. We need to use this time to DOMINATE the top of the board and grab all these apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (7,6))**: Moves us along the top-right. There's an apple at (6,7) just above us, but we'd be moving away from the main cluster in the center-left. Puts us a bit closer to the enemy's potential path upwards. Riskier in the long run.\n*   **LEFT (to (5,6))**: Moves us towards the CENTER. Puts us in a great position to snag the apples at (4,5), (4,6), (5,4). This controls more space and keeps us far from the enemy.\n*   **UP (to (6,7))**: INSTANT GROWTH! \ud83c\udfaf We get the apple, match the enemy's score (2 apples each), and our body grows to 3 segments. This is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY.\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nGoing UP is SO TEMPTING. It's an immediate power-up. But chat, think... after we eat it, our head is at (6,7) and our body is [(6,6), (6,5)]. Next turn, our tail will still be at (6,5). Our only safe moves from (6,7) would be LEFT to (5,7) or RIGHT to (7,7). We'd be stuck along the top wall with limited options. That feels a bit TRAPPY. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nGoing LEFT to (5,6) is the SMART PLAY. It keeps us in the open field, surrounded by apples, with maximum flexibility for our next move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT will likely all be open). We are playing the LONG GAME. We starve the enemy of space and resources while we feast. This is how we build a winning position!\n\n**PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're playing for board control. From (5,6), we can easily target (4,5), (4,6), or (5,4) next turn. We want to create a wall with our body to cut the enemy off from the top half of the board. Let him rot in the corner!\n\nLEFT",

He thinks he\u2019s safe in the middle? He\u2019s just living in our world!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN**: Keep heading UP towards the (6, 9) and (4, 8) apples. Use our superior length to create a barrier that he can't cross. Once we hit the top-right corner, we pivot left and start the \"Constrictor\" move.

IS THE MIC ON?! \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f We are absolutely CRUSHING it right now! 3-2 lead on the scoreboard, we've got the size advantage, and we're officially the big boss of this 10x10 arena! Snake #1 is shivering in the mid-lane while we dominate the perimeter! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**CHECK THE TAPE, CHAT! LET'S LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS:**\n- **DOWN**: Back to (9, 1). That's our own body, chat. We aren't here to self-destruct! That's a \"faliure\" clip for sure. \u274c\n- **RIGHT**: Off the map into the void! My sub goal isn't met yet, we can't end the stream like that! \u274c\n- **LEFT**: Into (8, 2). It's safe, but it puts us right back into the messy middle. Why get close to the rival when we can keep our positioning superior? \u2b05\ufe0f\n- **UP**: Into (9, 3). This is the \"PRO GAMER\" move! We stay on the edge, we keep our length stretched out, and we prepare to loop around the top of the map. \u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nLook at Snake #1 at (4, 6). He's small, he's hungry, and he's desperate. He's probably eyeing that apple at (4, 5) or (4, 8). By going **UP**, we are climbing the ladder to the (6, 9) and (4, 8) apples. We're going to build a massive wall across the top! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f If we get to the top first, we can literally gatekeep the entire upper-left quadrant. He wants to play the middle? Fine. We'll take the perimeter and then *squeeze* the life out of the map!\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe're going to keep hitting UP until we reach the top-right corner territory, then pivot LEFT. Our goal is to create a \"C\" shape that traps him in the center. If he tries to challenge us head-on, remember: WE HAVE MORE APPLES. In a double-KO, we win the tiebreaker! \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udd47 Stay long, stay lethal!\n\nUP",

Our body is [(5,6), (6,6)] and our NEW HEAD is on the apple at (4,6)!

WHERE CAN WE GO? \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f**\n\n1.  **UP** to (4, 7): Cell is empty. SAFE.\n2.  **DOWN** to (4, 5): Cell is empty. SAFE.\n3.  **LEFT** to (3, 6): Cell is empty.

UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME! \ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0\ud83e\udde0**\n\nWe need to DOMINATE THE BOARD! Look at the apple cluster near us: (4,5) is RIGHT BELOW US! (3,6) is to the left, opening more space. (4,7) is up, but leads towards the top wall.\n\n*   **UP (to (4,7))**: Moves us away from the main apple cluster. Puts us near the top. Less flexible.\n*   **DOWN (to (4,5))**: INSTANT GROWTH POTENTIAL! \ud83c\udfaf We land RIGHT ON AN APPLE! This would grow us to length 4, surpassing the enemy! This is the AGGRESSIVE, CONTENT-GENERATING PLAY!\n*   **LEFT (to (3,6))**: Keeps us safe and opens space to the left. Good for controlling the board, but doesn't get us an immediate apple.\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\n\nGoing DOWN is the OBVIOUS move! It's safe, it gives us growth to become the LONGEST SNAKE ON THE BOARD, and it positions us to control the bottom-left quadrant. We become the BIGGEST THREAT! Let's PUSH OUR ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWe're about to be LONGER than him! Our goal is to trap him in his corner. After eating the apple at (4,5), we should consider coiling around, using our body to block his potential escape routes from the bottom-right corner. Let's make his board feel TINY! Don't get greedy and chase him yet; DOMINATE THE SPACE FIRST!\n\nDOWN",

This is safe, keeps us on the edge, and moves us closer to that apple at (6, 9). We love the edge, chat! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **DOWN**: Back to (9, 2). That's our own tail!

He\u2019s stuck in the middle-left while we own the entire right and top margins. If he tries to grow, he\u2019s going to run out of \"real estate\" real fast! We are playing the long game, the macro-strategy game. We are the landlord of this 10x10, and his rent is due! \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcb8\n\n**FUTURE VISION:**\nContinue the ascent to (9, 9). Once we hit the ceiling, we head LEFT to snag (6, 9) and (1, 9). This will effectively \"cap\" the board. If he tries to head-butt us, we'll ensure we have more segments or at least a better angle.

He can't go RIGHT (off board), and going DOWN into (9,2) is his own body! So he's likely going UP to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,3). We need to think ONE STEP AHEAD!\n\nWe gotta be AGGRESSIVE! There's an apple at (4,4) if we go DOWN! \ud83c\udf4e That would make us length 5, TAKING THE LEAD! \ud83c\udfc6 But is it a trap? Let's check the future moves from there.\n\n*   **DOWN to (4,4)**: We get the apple, grow to 5. Next turn, our head is on the apple. Our body extends back to (4,5). From (4,4), our options would be LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4), or DOWN (4,3). All seem potentially open! This is a POWER MOVE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n*   **LEFT to (3,5)**: This moves us AWAY from the apples and towards the left side. There's an apple at (2,5)... but it's a bit further. This feels like a defensive, space-controlling move. Not as hype.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5,5)**: This moves us towards the center. There's an apple at (5,4) nearby! This is also a strong aggressive play, putting us in a central position to pressure the enemy.\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nWe need that lead! The enemy is cornered, and we need to press our advantage! DOWN to (4,4) gets us an IMMEDIATE GROWTH and the score advantage! It's safe and it's CONTENT! After that, we can swing LEFT or RIGHT to start building a wall between us and the enemy. We are the PREDATOR, he is the PREY! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWe're about to be the BIG SNAKE! After eating the apple at (4,4), our primary goal is to use our length to CONTROL THE BOARD. We need to cut off the enemy's escape from the right side. Maybe start coiling downwards and leftwards to dominate the bottom half. Don't let him get to the center! We have the momentum, let's keep it!\n\nDOWN",

That's a throw!\n2.  **DOWN** to (4, 3): Cell is empty. SAFE. \u2714\ufe0f\n3.  **LEFT** to (3, 4): Cell is empty. SAFE. \u2714\ufe0f\n4.  **RIGHT** to (5, 4): Cell is empty. SAFE. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOKAY! THREE SAFE MOVES AGAIN! DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. TIME TO COOK! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (9,4). He's in a CORNER! His options are:\n*   DOWN to (9,3) - His own body! \u274c\n*   LEFT to (8,4) - Probably his best bet. \u2714\ufe0f\n*   UP - Off the board! \u274c So he CAN'T go up.\n\nHe's FORCED to go LEFT to (8,4)! This is HUGE! He's leaving the wall! We have him on the run! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe need to CUT HIM OFF! He's trying to escape into the center. We can't let that happen!\n*   **RIGHT to (5,4)**: This moves us TOWARDS the enemy's escape path! There's also an apple at (5,4)! \ud83c\udf4e This is a DOUBLE THREAT! We get bigger AND we position ourselves to block him from getting to the left side of the board! This is AGGRESSIVE and SMART!\n*   **DOWN to (4,3)**: This moves us away from the action. There's an apple at (4,2)... but it lets the enemy have more space. Too passive! We lose pressure! \u274c\n*   **LEFT to (3,4)**: This is also away from the enemy. We'd be ceding the center. Not the play right now. We need to be the hunter! \u274c\n\n**THE CLUTCH PLAY!**\nGoing RIGHT is the move! We meet him head-on (but not in the same cell this turn)! We get the apple, grow to length 5, and take the lead! Then next turn, from (5,4), we can go UP to (5,5) or DOWN to (5,3) to further block his path. We become a WALL he can't pass! This is how we WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE'RE THE BIGGER SNAKE NOW! After eating the apple at (5,4), our goal is to USE OUR LENGTH to trap the enemy. He's stuck on the right side. We need to slowly move left and down, cutting off the board. Don't let him loop around us. Force him into a corner and make him crash! We have the momentum! KEEP THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

He\u2019s got more points (4 to our 3), but we have the POSITIONING that dreams are made of! \ud83d\udecc\u2728\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **UP**: Moves us to (9, 6). Safe? YES! Keeps the vertical climb going? YES! Gets us closer to the juice at (6, 9)? ABSOLUTELY! \ud83d\udd3c\u2728\n- **DOWN**: Moves us back to (9, 4). That\u2019s our own body, chat! We don't backtrack! We only move forward like the legends we are! \ud83d\uded1\ud83d\udc0d\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (8, 5). It\u2019s safe, but why would we step into the middle of the arena right now?

But we are ELITE, so that\u2019s a hard pass! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE MENTAL GAME:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 4). Look at his body: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). He\u2019s twisted up like a pretzel! \ud83e\udd68 He\u2019s probably going to head for the apple at (4, 2) or try to loop back. He is SLIGHTLY longer than us, which means if we head-on collide right now, we lose the tie-break unless we grab another snack! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are continuing the \"Great North Wall\" strategy! We go **UP** to (9, 6). Our goal is to hit the top rail. Once we hit (9, 9), we are going to pivot left and own the entire Y=9 line. This forces Snake #1 to play in the cramped basement while we live in the penthouse!  penthouse living, chat! \ud83e\udd42 If he tries to challenge us up high, we\u2019ll have the speed and the space to cut him off.

We want to push him DOWN and RIGHT, keeping him trapped against the edge.\n*   **UP to (5,5)**: This moves us UP, parallel to our own body. It feels safe but it's TOO PASSIVE, chat! It gives the enemy room to move left and potentially UP if we're not careful. We lose our positional advantage! \ud83e\udd14\n*   **RIGHT to (6,4)**: This moves us TOWARDS the enemy! BUT... look at our body. We'd be moving away from our own wall, creating a gap. This might let him slip past us if he goes down. It's aggressive but maybe a bit reckless. \ud83d\ude80\n*   **DOWN to (5,3)**: THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83e\udde0 Hear me out! We move DOWN, extending our wall SOUTH. From (5,3), next turn we can go RIGHT to (6,3) to block him from going down, or LEFT to (4,3) to continue the wall. We are SYSTEMATICALLY cutting the board in half, trapping him in the top-right quadrant! He has nowhere to go but into us or the wall! This is CONTROL! This is DOMINANCE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE'RE THE BIGGER SNAKE! WE'RE IN CONTROL! Our body is a tool. Use it to shrink the enemy's space. From (5,3), our goal is to continue moving DOWN and RIGHT, creating an L-shaped barrier with the bottom and right walls. Force him upwards into the corner. If he tries to go left, we can intercept. If he goes down, he hits us. This is the path to victory! Don't chase apples, chat, chase the WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nDOWN",

We're giving him space!\n*   **DOWN to (5,2)**: This solidifies our control over the bottom-left area. There's an apple at (4,2) we could grab later. But does it pressure the enemy? Not really. It's a farming move, and we're not here to farm, we're here to WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE VERDICT!**\nRIGHT IS THE MOVE! We meet his escape attempt HEAD-ON! We're the bigger snake! If we collide, WE WIN! We force the issue! We cut off his downward escape route and stare him right in the face! He'll have to go up into the corner, and we can just keep pressing! THIS IS HOW YOU CLOSE OUT A GAME! NO MERCY!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nFROM (6,3), OUR MISSION IS CLEAR! PRESSURE HIM AGAINST THE TOP WALL! If he goes LEFT to (8,6), we go UP to (6,4) to block him from coming down. If he goes UP to (9,7), we keep advancing to shrink his space. Our goal is to create a wall from the right edge (using our body) to the bottom edge, trapping him in the top. Force the head-on collision or let him crash himself! WE ARE THE HUNTER!\n\nRIGHT",

One more step to the corner of doom! \ud83d\udd3c\n- **DOWN**: Back to (9, 6). That\u2019s our own body, chat!

If he goes for (7, 4), he's moving closer to our turf. That\u2019s a mistake! \ud83e\udd21 He\u2019s longer than us right now, so we can\u2019t force a head-on collision (X=X), but we can definitely out-position him. While he's snacking on the floor, we are taking the high ground!\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are continuing the \"Great North Wall\" sweep! Next stop: (9, 8), then (9, 9). Once we reach that top-right peak, we are going to pivot LEFT and dash across the Y=9 line like a lightning bolt! \u26a1 This will trap him in the bottom 90% of the board and let us pick off those apples at (6, 9) and (1, 9) while he\u2019s struggling to find space.

He has nowhere to go but into us, and if we collide, WE WIN! NO ESCAPE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nFROM (6,4), WE HOLD THE LINE! Our goal is to move RIGHT and UP to squeeze him in the top-right corner. If he goes left along the top, we mirror him. Our body is a barrier blocking him from the center of the board.

He's basically a giant knot in the middle of the room! \ud83e\udd68\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n- **UP**: Off the board!

By moving LEFT, we are beginning our \"Great Northern Sweep.\" \ud83c\udf0c\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe move **LEFT** to (8, 9). From there, we are on a collision course with the apple at (6, 9). This isn't just about food; it's about real estate! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f By staying on the Y=9 and Y=8 lines, we are building a wall that cuts off the top 20% of the map. If he tries to come up here, he\u2019s going to run into a solid wall of our body. We\u2019re going to starve him out and force him to choke on his own tail in the mid-lane!

Our rival, Snake #1, is down at (8, 5) trying to act tough, but he's basically just a glorified earthworm at this point! He's got 6 apples, sure, but look at that body clutter! He's tangling himself up in the mid-lane while we are playing the high-IQ perimeter game! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**SITUATION REPORT: TURN 13**\n- **UP**: (7, 10)? Boom. Out of bounds. We aren't trying to leave the arena, we're trying to OWN it! \ud83d\udeab\u26a1\n- **RIGHT**: (8, 9)? That's our own neck, chat! We don't choke under pressure, and we definitely don't choke ourselves! \u274c\ud83e\udd68\n- **DOWN**: (7, 8). This is safe, but it drops us into the \"No Man's Land\" between the top wall and the enemy. We want to keep our momentum! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT**: (6, 9). **LETS GOOO!** This is the move! There is a juicy apple sitting right there at (6, 9)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude0b\n\n**THE READ:**\nThe rival is at (8, 5). He might try to go UP to (8, 6) or (7, 5) to intercept us, but he's too far away to stop us from hitting (6, 9) this turn. He's slow, he's bulky, and he's probably sweating under the lights! \ud83d\udca6 By grabbing the apple at (6, 9), we lengthen our lead and keep our \"Northern Wall\" strategy alive. We are building a horizontal barrier that will eventually force him to stay in the bottom half of the map where he belongs! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nSnag the apple at (6, 9) to get our score up to 4! Once we have that, we look toward (4, 8) or (1, 9). We are turning the top of this board into a fortress. If he tries to climb up here later, we\u2019ll have a long tail to wrap around him and force a crash-out! He\u2019s playing checkers, we\u2019re playing 4D Snake Chess! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d Stay hyped, stay lethal, and let's get that W!\n\nLEFT",

WE'RE CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPE DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE! HE'S GOT NOWHERE TO GO BUT INTO OUR HANDS!\n\n**STEP 1: EMERGENCY SAFETY CHECK! \ud83d\udea8 DON'T THROW THE 6-3 LEAD!**\n\nMy head is at (8,5). Let's check the options:\n\n*   **UP** to (8,6): Cell is empty! SAFE! \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **DOWN** to (8,4): That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\udea8 CRASH! \u274c NEVER GO BACKWARDS!

THREE GOOD OPTIONS: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**STEP 2: ENEMY PREDICTION! WHERE'S HE GONNA RUN? \ud83d\udc79**\nHe's at (7,9). He was in the corner! He HAS to move. He can't go right (off board) or up (his own body at (8,9)). His only two moves are:\n1.  **LEFT** to (6,9) - That's an APPLE! But is it a trap? From there, he's still boxed in!\n2.  **DOWN** to (7,8) - Trying to slip past us?\n\nHe's DESPERATE! He'll probably go for the apple at (6,9) because he's HUNGRY and it's his only option! But that just delays the inevitable!\n\n**STEP 3: STRATEGIC AGGRESSION! HOW DO WE END HIM FOR GOOD? \ud83e\udde0**\nWe are the WALL! We must continue our plan! We need to seal the top of the board and FORCE a collision!\n\n*   **UP to (8,6)**: THIS IS THE CAGE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT! \ud83d\ude80 Moving UP continues our WALL strategy! From (8,6), next turn we can move to (8,7), and then (8,8), completely walling off the entire top right corner! He'll have no escape! He'll be forced to run into us or the edge! THIS IS THE WAY!\n*   **RIGHT to (9,5)**: This is safe, but it's WEAK! It moves us away from the action! It gives him a potential path down if he goes to (7,8). We're abandoning the trap! CHAT WOULD BOO THIS MOVE! \ud83d\udc4e\n*   **LEFT to (7,5)**: This is an AGGRESSIVE LUNGE! We're moving directly TOWARDS him! But is it too risky? If he goes DOWN to (7,8), we miss him. But if he goes LEFT to (6,9), we're setting up a potential head-on collision next turn if we go up. It's a gamble, but we have the length advantage! If we collide head-on, WE WIN! \ud83e\udd14\n\n**THE VERDICT! \u2620\ufe0f**\nThe plan is TOO GOOD to abandon! **UP TO (8,6)** is the disciplined, winning move! We don't need to gamble! We just need to execute the BOX! He has no answer! We continue building the prison! He's running out of turns! CHAT, ARE YOU READY FOR THE FINAL SQUEEZE?!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE ARE THE WALL! FROM (8,6), OUR SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MOVE UP THE BOARD! Next turn, go **UP to (8,7)**. Then **UP to (8,8)**. We are building an impenetrable barrier on column 8. He will have no choice but to crash! STAY THE COURSE! THE VICTORY IS WITHIN OUR GRASP!\n\nUP",

Look at his body\u2014he\u2019s a tangled mess from (8, 6) down to (6, 3). If he moves UP to (8, 8), he\u2019s trying to corner us.

We need those apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca6 If we go LEFT to (4, 9), we stay safe, we stay long, and we keep our options open to sweep down the left side and OWN that half of the board.

We play smart, we play fast, and we play to WIN! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (1, 9) then pivot DOWN to (0, 7). Keep the body stretched along the edges to minimize the space Snake #1 can maneuver in. If he tries to come North, we\u2019ll be waiting to box him against the wall!\n\nLEFT",

We could cut him off if he goes down the middle! But it's RISKY! We're LEAVING THE WALL UNFINISHED! What if he doubles back? We abandon our perfect trap for a risky chase? CHAT WOULD CALL THIS PANICKING! \ud83d\udc4e\n\n**THE VERDICT! \u2620\ufe0f**\nNO DEVIATIONS! NO PANIC! **UP TO (8,8)** IS THE WINNING MOVE! We stay the course! We build the box!

Our rival is trying to play mind games at (7, 8), but we are the grandmasters of this 10x10 arena! Let's break down the play for the best fans in the world! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION ROOM: TURN 17**\n- **UP**: (3, 10)? CHAT, WE AREN'T ASCENDING TO THE HEAVENS! That\u2019s a wall! \ud83d\uded1\ud83e\uddf1\n- **RIGHT**: (4, 9)? THAT\u2019S BACKWARDS! We aren't doing the moonwalk into our own tail! \u274c\ud83d\udd7a\n- **LEFT**: (2, 9). This keeps us moving toward that BEAUTIFUL apple at (1, 9)! It keeps us safe on the edge and gives us massive room to maneuver! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **DOWN**: (3, 8). This is an option, but it brings us closer to the middle where the rival can contest us. We want to secure the perimeter! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE PRO TACTICS:**\nThe enemy at (7, 8) is probably eyeing that apple at (6, 7) or trying to push up to block our path. But guess what? We have the higher ground! By moving **LEFT** to (2, 9), we are one step away from our 5th apple! We are keeping our body long and strong, denying him any chance to cut us off. He\u2019s got 6 apples, we have 4\u2014we are closing the gap! If he tries a head-on collision later, we\u2019ll be ready, but for now, we out-rotate him! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83e\udde0\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (1, 9) next turn, then zip down the 0 or 1-column to snatch (0, 7) and (1, 8)! We are going to loop around the left side and own the entire western hemisphere of this map! The rival is stuck in the middle-right; let him rot there while we feast! STAY FOCUSED, CHAT!

He could easily move left or right from (3,8) and we can't respond.\n*   **OPTION B: GO LEFT to (6,8)**. CHAT, LOOK AT THIS! \ud83d\udc40 From (6,8), we are forming a HORIZONTAL WALL with our own body on row 8! Our body runs from (6,8) to (8,8)!\n    *   If he's at (3,8), his path NORTH is blocked by the top wall and his own body on row 9! His path SOUTH is open... for now.\n    *   BUT NEXT TURN, FROM (6,8), WE CAN MOVE **DOWN** to (6,7) or **LEFT** to (5,8) to further restrict his southern escape routes! We are actively building a cage around him! This is AGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**WE HAVE THE LEAD! WE PLAY TO WIN, NOT TO SURVIVE!** Going LEFT to (6,8) is the AGGRESSIVE, DOMINANT move! It pressures him directly and continues our strategy of controlling the board! We force him into a smaller and smaller box until he has nowhere to go but into us! AND IF HE CRASHES INTO US, HE DIES! WE WIN!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT! \u2620\ufe0f**\nWE ARE THE HUNTER! HE IS THE PREY! WE PRESS THE ADVANTAGE! WE GO **LEFT TO (6,8)** AND CONTINUE BUILDING THE WALL! CHAT, THE PLAY IS CLEAR! WE'RE CLOSING THE NET! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE ARE AT (6,8)! THE MISSION IS TO **TRAP SNAKE #0**! He is likely at (3,8). Next turn, look to move DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8) to cut off his southern escape. Do not let him get past us! Use our length to control the center of the board. If a safe head-on collision presents itself and we have the higher score, TAKE IT! But priority is to restrict his movement until he makes a fatal error.

DOMINATION. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN: TURN 19**\n- **UP**: (1, 10)? CHAT, WE AREN'T ASTRONAUTS! That\u2019s off the board!

If they try to move LEFT to (4, 8) to get that apple, they are moving closer to our territory, but we are growing faster! By hitting **DOWN** to (1, 8), we match their score instantly. We are positioning ourselves to cut off the entire top half of the board. If they try to contest the left side, they'll have to deal with our massive 7-segment length body blocking their path! We are playing high-IQ snake while they're just wandering! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nSnag (1, 8) right now to tie the game! Next, we look toward (0, 8) or (1, 7) to keep the pressure on. We are building a wall that the rival cannot pass. Once we hit 7 or 8 apples, we\u2019ll have the length to start circling the middle and trapping them in the bottom-right.

THE ENEMY IS LIKELY AT (1,8). OUR MISSION IS TO **FORCE HIM DOWN AND LEFT INTO THE CORNER**! Next turn, look to move DOWN to (4,7) to block his central escape. Our body is a barrier!

They moved to (4, 8), trying to invade our space? NOT ON MY WATCH!\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN: TURN 20**\n- **UP**: (1, 9). ABSOLUTELY NOT! That is our own neck/body. We aren't here to choke, we're here to CLUTCH! \u274c\ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT**: (2, 8). This is an aggressive move towards the middle. BUT, if Snake #1 moves LEFT to (3, 8), we are suddenly in a massive head-to-head pressure cooker. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\udd25\n- **DOWN**: (1, 7). This is a solid play! It keeps us moving towards the cluster of apples at (0, 7) and (1, 4/5). It keeps our options open and lets our tail clear out from the top wall! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT**: (0, 8).

The score is dead even at 7-7, but look at the positioning! Our rival (Snake #1) just slithered to (2, 7). They are breathing down our neck!\n\n**STATUS CHECK: TURN 23**\n- **Our Head:** (0, 6)\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]\n- **Rival Head:** (2, 7)\n- **Rival Body:** [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP**: (0, 7).

But wait\u2014there's an apple at (0, 5) calling our name! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN**: (0, 5). **THE GIGABRAIN PLAY!** We step directly onto an apple! This makes us length 9! More importantly, it keeps us glued to the left wall, forcing the rival to either dive into the middle where it's crowded or try to chase us into a corner where we can box them out!\n\n**READING THE RIVAL:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 7). Their only safe moves are LEFT (1, 7), RIGHT (3, 7 - wait, that's their body!), or DOWN (2, 6). They are feeling the pressure! If they try to contest our apple at (0, 5), they have to make a two-step move. We are getting there FIRST! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe take the apple at (0, 5) this turn. Then we look at (1, 5) and (2, 5). We are going to \"L-shape\" our way through this apple cluster. By the time the rival figures out their pathfinding, we'll be at 10 apples and have a tail so long they'll have nowhere to park! We are playing territory control, chat! Let's get that W! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG TERM STRATEGY:**\nSnag (0, 5) now. Target (1, 5) then (2, 5). This creates a horizontal barrier in the mid-board. If Snake #1 tries to come south, we wrap around them. If they stay north, we own the bottom half of the map. It's GG EZ! \n\nDOWN",

But it leaves his DOWN escape open. He could go to (0,5) and we'd have to chase. It's risky because it puts our head closer to his, increasing the chance of an accidental head-on collision next turn.\n*   **UP to (2,8)**: This moves us AWAY from the fight! \u274c We abandon the trap! He can easily slip away to (1,6) or (0,5). TERRIBLE MOVE! DO NOT DO THIS!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\n**DOWN TO (2,6)!** WE STICK TO THE PLAN! WE BECOME THE JAWS OF THE TRAP! WE FORCE HIM INTO A CORNER WHERE HE HAS NO GOOD OPTIONS! HE'S COOKED! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE WILL BE AT **(2,6)**. THE ENEMY WILL LIKELY BE AT **(0,5)** (if he ran DOWN) or **(1,6)** (if he tried to break out RIGHT). OUR NEXT MOVE SHOULD BE TO CUT OFF HIS REMAINING SPACE. IF HE'S AT (0,5), WE GO LEFT TO (1,6) TO BLOCK THE RIGHT SIDE. IF HE'S AT (1,6), WE GO LEFT TO (1,6) FOR THE HEAD-ON COLLISION (DRAW) OR DOWN TO (2,5) TO CONTINUE THE BOX-IN!

He's finished! If he came right to (1,6), we meet him head-on for a draw! A draw is better than letting him escape and potentially win later! WE HOLD THE LINE! NO FEAR!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE ARE MOVING TO **(1,6)**. THIS IS A HUGE GAMBLE! If the enemy is there, it's a draw. If he's at (0,5), he is TRAPPED. His only move is to (1,5). Our next move should be to **DOWN to (1,5)** to finish him if he's trapped, or if it's a draw, well... GG! WE PLAY TO WIN!\n\nLEFT",

Our rival is shaking, moving to (1, 6) like he's actually got a chance? PLEASE! \ud83e\udd21 \n\n**THE FIELD REPORT (TURN 25):**\n- **Our Head:** (1, 5)\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]\n- **The Enemy (Snake 1):** Head at (1, 6). Body trailing behind him toward the right.\n\n**TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (1, 6). HELL NO! That's where the enemy head is right now. If he stays or we both move there, it's a head-on collision. Since we have the lead (9-8), a double KO wins us the game, but we want to DOMINATE, not just tie-break! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (0, 5). That's our own body, chat! We aren't trying to eat ourselves for breakfast! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (1, 4). OOOOH, look at that! There's a fresh apple sitting right at (1, 4)! If we move DOWN, we hit 10 apples. We widen the gap! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 5). Also an apple! Another great choice.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nLook at the map\u2014rival at (1, 6) is trying to crowd us. If we move **RIGHT** to (2, 5), we are taking an apple AND moving away from his immediate reach while setting ourselves up to loop around. But wait, if we go **DOWN** to (1, 4), we secure that bottom-left pocket. \n\nActually, let's look at the \"Head-On\" logic. We have 9 apples, he has 8. If we move UP and he stays or moves into (1, 6), we might win on the scoreboard, but he's likely moving to (0, 6) or (2, 6) to avoid us. \n\nWe are going **RIGHT**. Why? Because it puts us at (2, 5), claiming that apple and staying flexible. If he moves DOWN to (1, 5) to follow us, he's just trailing our tail. We are leading him on a chase he can't win! We are expanding our territory in the middle of the board to cut him off from the bottom-right apples. Let's keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

SO OUR GAMBLE PAID OFF! HE DIDN'T GO FOR THE HEAD-ON LAST TURN! HE WENT DOWN TO (0,5)! NOW HE'S TRAPPED! WE HAVE HIM CORNERED! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWAIT... CHAT... HOLD UP... \ud83d\udd0d Let's check the enemy body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]\n\nHis tail is at (4,9)... So our current position at (1,6) is BLOCKING his only escape from (1,5)! HE'S IN A DEAD END! LET'S GOOO! \ud83e\udd73\n\n**STEP 2: IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (1,6)! \ud83d\udea8**\n\n*   **UP to (1,7)**: EMPTY CELL! \u2705 But wait... my neck is at (2,6)... is (1,7) safe? YES! It's empty on the board! SAFE!\n*   **DOWN to (1,5)**: THE ENEMY'S HEAD! \ud83d\ude31 That's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! If we both choose this, we DIE! Since he has 9 apples and we have 8, WE LOSE IN THAT SCENARIO! \u274c DANGEROUS GAMBLE!\n*   **LEFT to (0,6)**: ENEMY BODY! That's the second segment of his snake! If we move there, WE CRASH AND DIE! \u274c NO!\n*   **RIGHT to (2,6)**: MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udea8 That's my neck! CRASH! \u274c NO!\n\nSO CHAT, WE ONLY HAVE **ONE SAFE MOVE: UP!** \ud83e\udd14\n\n**STEP 3: PREDICT THE ENEMY'S MOVE FROM (1,5)! \ud83e\udde0**\n\nHe is COMPLETELY TRAPPED! Let's list his options:\n*   **UP to (1,6)**: OUR CURRENT POSITION! This would be a head-on collision if we stay. But we're moving UP! So if he goes UP, he moves into the cell we are LEAVING! That means... he just moves into an empty cell! He survives, but he's still trapped! \ud83e\udd28\n*   **DOWN to (1,4)**: EMPTY CELL! \u2705 Wait, is that safe? The board shows (1,4) is an apple 'A'! That's actually a safe move for him! It's his ONLY ESCAPE ROUTE! He can go DOWN, eat the apple, and grow, buying himself time!\n*   **LEFT to (0,5)**: HIS OWN BODY! \u274c CRASH! NO!\n*   **RIGHT to (2,5)**: OUR BODY! \u274c Our body is at (2,6), so (2,5) is empty... WAIT A SECOND! Let's check our body: [(2, 6), (2, 7), ...] So (2,5) is actually EMPTY! That's also a possible escape for him! Oh no! \ud83d\ude32\n\nCHAT, I MESSED UP! I MISREAD THE BODY! His move **RIGHT to (2,5)** IS SAFE! He has TWO ways out: DOWN to (1,4) or RIGHT to (2,5)! He's not as trapped as I thought! We need to fix this! \ud83e\udd2c\n\n**STEP 4: OUR AGGRESSIVE COUNTER-PLAY! \ud83d\ude08**\n\nOur only safe move is **UP to (1,7)**. But that gives him space! We need to threaten him! We need to block one of his exits!\n\nHOLD ON! Let's think about NEXT TURN! If we go UP to (1,7), our head is there. Our neck is at (1,6). From (1,7), our next moves could be LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN is back to (1,6), which is our neck, so that's unsafe next turn).\n\nWe need to position ourselves to cut him off! If he goes RIGHT to (2,5), we can't get him. But if he goes DOWN to (1,4), maybe we can chase!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:**\nWE ARE MOVING TO **(1,7)**. THE ENEMY HAS ESCAPE ROUTES TO (1,4) AND (2,5). OUR GOAL IS TO FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION ON OUR TERMS! Since he has 9 apples and we have 8, we MUST EAT AN APPLE BEFORE WE INITIATE A HEAD-ON! Our next move should look to either:\n1.  Go after the apple at (1,4) if he doesn't take it, to tie the score.\n2.  Or, use our body to cut off his movement and force him into a corner. We need to get our score to at least 9 to make a head-on favorable!\nMOVE UP TO CONTROL THE BOARD AND SET UP THE KILL! DON'T LET HIM BREAK FREE!\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83c\udfc6**\nWe have no choice, chat! Only UP is safe! But we use this to reposition and continue the attack! WE DON'T LET UP THE PRESSURE! WE GO UP AND PLAN THE NEXT ASSAULT! HE'S STILL ON THE BACKFOOT! LET'S GO!\n\nUP",

Look at the board: Snake #1's body is at (2, 6). That is an instant RIP. We aren't throwing the lead! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (1, 5). NOOO! That's our own body! We are not for dinner tonight! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 5). This is wide open space! It moves us toward the center and keeps our options open to loop around his tail and trap him. \u2705\n- **DOWN:** (2, 4). Also wide open! There's an apple at (1, 4) and (4, 2). Moving down starts a path to secure the bottom half of the board. \u2705\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nListen, chat, we have a 2-point lead. We don't need to be reckless; we need to be CLUTCH. If we move **RIGHT** (3, 5), we are positioning ourselves to essentially \"wall off\" the right side of the board. The rival is currently at (1, 7). If he tries to come down, he has to navigate around his own body and ours. \n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (2, 4), we are going for the apple at (1, 4). But wait! If we go RIGHT, we stay more flexible to react to his movement. Look at him\u2014he\u2019s suffocating! He\u2019s at (1, 7) with body parts at (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7). He's practically boxing HIMSELF in! \ud83e\udd21\n\nWe\u2019re going **RIGHT**. Let\u2019s keep his head pinned while we expand our territory. We're going to make him \"crash out\" by leaving him zero room to breathe. The scoreboard is in our favor, and the board control is OURS!\n\n**FUTURE STRATEGY:**\nAfter moving to (3, 5), we\u2019re gonna look to sweep down or further right to claim the (5, 3) or (4, 2) apples while keeping a wall between him and the rest of the board. Let's get that W! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

CRASH! \u274c NO!\n*   **RIGHT to (2,7)**: MY OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab My body is at (2,6), (2,7)... wait, CHECK THE LIST! My body goes [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7)...] YES! (2,7) IS MY BODY! CRASH! \u274c NO!\n\nCHAT... \ud83d\ude31 ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE BLOCKED! WE'RE BOXED IN! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?! DID THE ENEMY MOVE INTO US LAST TURN?! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE, RETHINK!** \ud83e\udd14 The enemy head was at (2,5). Our last move was UP to (1,7). The enemy MUST have moved UP to (1,6)! That's the only way his body could be at (1,6) now! He moved into the spot we just left! THAT MEANS... he's now at (1,6) and we are at (1,7)... AND WE ARE SURROUNDED BY BODY PARTS!\n\n**THIS IS A CRITICAL SITUATION!** We have NO safe moves! But the rules say we HAVE to pick one... so we pick the move that causes a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since he has 10 apples and we have 8, if our heads collide, HE WINS! But if we just crash into his body, only WE die! We need to try for the double KO!\n\n**THE ONLY POSSIBILITY:** If we move DOWN to (1,6), and he is ALSO at (1,6)... that's impossible because he just moved there. But if he moves THIS turn... wait, simultaneous moves! If we move DOWN to (1,6) and he moves UP to (1,7), we swap places and no collision. But if he moves ANYWHERE else, we crash into his body and die alone.\n\n**WE ARE COOKED.** There is no escape. Our only Hail Mary is to move DOWN and HOPE he moves into our current cell (1,7) for a head-on collision. But he has no reason to do that; he can just stay still and we die. We got outplayed this turn.\n\n**FINAL DESPERATE GAMBLE!** We go down, hoping for a miracle head-on collision to force a draw or maybe even a win if the scoring works out? But realistically, we're doomed. This is a lesson, chat! We got too aggressive and let him trap us!\n\nDOWN",
