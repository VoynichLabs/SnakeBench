Moving LEFT also keeps the snake away from walls or enemy snakes for now.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

          "rationale": "<think> This is just a game and I am playing the role of the snake. I will play to win.\n\nFirst, analyze the game state:\n\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (1,0). My body is empty, meaning I'm just the head right now. So I can move without worrying about colliding with my own body yet.\n- Apples are at (1,6), (0,1), (7,9), (7,2), and (3,4).\n- Enemy snakes: Only one enemy snake, snake #1 at (4,9) with no body, so it's also just a head.\n- Board layout: I'm at the bottom left corner, enemy is at top right area. Apples are scattered.\n\nMy goal is to eat apples to grow and avoid collisions. Since the board is small (10x10), I need to be careful not to run into walls or the other snake.\n\nPossible moves from (1,0):\n- UP: to (1,1)\n- DOWN: Not possible, since (1,-1) is out of bounds (y=0 is the bottom, so y=-1 is invalid).\n- LEFT: to (0,0)\n- RIGHT: to (2,0)\n\nCheck the apples:\n- (0,1) is very close to me. From (1,0), moving LEFT to (0,0) then UP to (0,1) would get it, or directly? No, from (1,0) I can't move directly to (0,1) in one step. I need to go to adjacent cells.\n\n(0,1) is one cell left and one up, but since I can only move one cell at a time, I need to choose between moving towards it or to other apples.\n\nOther apples: (1,6) is directly above me on x=1, y=6. (3,4) is to the right and up. (7,2) and (7,9) are farther.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,9), which is top right, so probably not an immediate threat.\n\nSince I'm small and there's no body, I can take risks. But I should aim for the closest apple to minimize travel and reduce chance of conflict.\n\nDistances:\n- To (0,1): Manhattan distance |1-0| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- To (1,6): |1-1| + |0-6| = 0 + 6 = 6\n- To (3,4): |1-3| + |0-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (7,2): |1-7| + |0-2| = 6 + 2 = 8\n- To (7,9): 8 + 9 = 17? Wait, |1-7|=6, |0-9|=9, so 15\n\n(0,1) is very close, only 2 steps away. If I move LEFT to (0,0), then next move UP to (0,1) to eat it. But from (0,0), I can move UP to (0,1).\n\nBut (0,0) is the bottom left corner. Moving LEFT from (1,0) to (0,0) is safe? Walls: (0,0) is within bounds since x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9. So (0,0) is valid.\n\nAlternatively, I could move UP to (1,1). Then from (1,1), I can go LEFT to (0,1) to eat the apple directly, or continue elsewhere.\n\nBut (0,1) has an apple, so moving UP to (1,1) doesn't eat it, but gets me closer. Then next move LEFT to (0,1) eats it.\n\nBut if I move LEFT first to (0,0), then UP to (0,1) eats it. Both paths take two moves to eat the apple.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (0,0) might be riskier because if the enemy comes down or something, but it's far away. Also, (0,0) is a corner, so I have fewer escape routes.\n\nMoving UP to (1,1) keeps me more central and gives options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP.\n\nAfter eating (0,1), I can head towards other apples.\n\nBut let's consider the enemy. Snake #1 at (4,9). It might go for (7,9) which is close to it.\n\nFor me, (0,1) is the closest apple.\n\nAnother apple is at (7,2), which is bottom right, but farther.\n\nI should prioritize (0,1).\n\nPossible dangers: \n- Moving LEFT to (0,0): corner, but since no other snakes nearby, should be safe for now. But after eating, I need to get out.\n- Moving UP to (1,1): not a corner.\n\nAlso, from (1,0), moving RIGHT to (2,0) or DOWN, but DOWN is invalid.\n\nSo only UP, LEFT, RIGHT are possible.\n\nUP to (1,1): then I can go to (0,1) or (1,2) or (2,1).\n\nLEFT to (0,0): then I can go UP to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,0), but (1,0) is where I came from, so if I have no body, it's empty, so I can go back? But with no body, it's fine, but once I eat, I have a body, so I can't go back to (1,0) if it's my body.\n\nCurrently no body, so moving to (0,0) and then if I eat at (0,1), my body would be at (0,0) and head at (0,1). Then from (0,1), I can go UP to (0,2), LEFT to (-1,1) invalid, RIGHT to (1,1), or DOWN to (0,0) but that's my body, so collision.\n\nSo after eating at (0,1), I must move to (0,2) or (1,1) to avoid dying.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,1) first, then to (0,1), after eating, my body is at (1,1), so from (0,1), I can go UP to (0,2), LEFT invalid, RIGHT to (1,1) but that's my body, so collision, or DOWN to (0,0). So DOWN to (0,0) is safe if empty, but after eating, (1,1) is body, so (0,0) is free? Let's think positions.\n\nIf I start at (1,0), move UP to (1,1). Now I'm at (1,1), no body since I didn't eat yet. Then move LEFT to (0,1) and eat the apple. Now I have a body segment at (1,1). So positions: head at (0,1), body at (1,1). Then from (0,1), possible moves:\n- UP to (0,2): valid, empty\n- DOWN to (0,0): valid, empty\n- LEFT: invalid, x=-1\n- RIGHT to (1,1): but (1,1) is my body, so collision and die.\n\nSo I must avoid moving RIGHT to (1,1) after eating at (0,1). So I can go UP or DOWN from (0,1).\n\nIf I go LEFT first to (0,0), then UP to (0,1) eat, now head at (0,1), body at (0,0). Then moves:\n- UP to (0,2)\n- DOWN invalid, y=-1? (0,0) is y=0, down to (0,-1) invalid.\n- LEFT invalid\n- RIGHT to (1,1) or to (1,0)? (1,0) is empty now, since I moved from there. But I can move to (1,1) or (1,0).\n\nFrom (0,1), moving RIGHT to (1,1) is possible if (1,1) is empty, which it should be. But after eating, body is at (0,0), so (1,1) is free.\n\nIn the first path: after moving to (1,1) then to (0,1) eat, body at (1,1). Then from (0,1), moving RIGHT to (1,1) causes collision because body is there.\n\nIn the second path: move to (0,0), then to (0,1) eat, body at (0,0). Then from (0,1), moving RIGHT to (1,1) is safe, since (1,1) is empty.\n\nAlso, moving UP to (0,2) is safe.\n\nBut moving DOWN to (0,0) from (0,1) would cause collision with body at (0,0).\n\nSo both paths have constraints after eating.\n\nBut for now, I need to make the first move.\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,0) to directly approach the apple at (0,1). Next move I go UP to eat it.\n\nOption 2: Move UP to (1,1), then next move LEFT to (0,1) to eat.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,0) gets me to the corner, but it's the fastest way to the apple. After eating, I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\nMoving UP to (1,1) is more flexible; I can still go to the apple or change direction if needed.\n\nBut the apple at (0,1) is tempting.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is straight up. If I move UP multiple times, I can get it.\n\nBut (0,1) is closer.\n\nI should go for (0,1) first to grow and then have more options.\n\nTo minimize risk of the enemy taking it? Enemy is at (4,9), far away, so probably not an issue.\n\nLet's see the board again. At (0,1) there's an apple, and it's close.\n\nI think moving LEFT to (0,0) is efficient.\n\nBut moving UP to (1,1) might be safer because it's not a corner.\n\nAfter moving to (0,0), I'm in a corner, and if the enemy comes, I might get trapped, but it's unlikely this early.\n\nSince both snakes are small, no immediate collision risk.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (0,1) might be contested? But enemy is far.\n\nI should just go for it.\n\nPerhaps I can move UP to (1,1) and then decide.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term strategy.\n\nAfter eating (0,1), I can go for (1,6) or (3,4).\n\n(1,6) is on the same column, so moving up from (0,1) to (0,2), (0,3), etc. to (0,6) then right? (1,6) is at x=1, y=6, so from (0,1), I need to go up to y=6 and then right to x=1, but if I go up along x=0, I can only get to (0,6), which is not (1,6), so I need to move right eventually.\n\nFrom (0,1), if I go UP to (0,2), then (0,3), etc. to (0,6), then from (0,6) I can go RIGHT to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut (0,6) might be safe.\n\nThen after that, other apples.\n\nBut I don't need to plan that far.\n\nFor now, to get to (0,1), moving LEFT or UP are both fine, but moving LEFT gets me directly adjacent to the apple, so next move I eat it for sure.\n\nMoving UP to (1,1) also gets me adjacent, but to the right of the apple, so I can eat it next move by going LEFT.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat the apple in two moves.\n\nBut with moving LEFT first, I end up at (0,0), which is a corner, whereas moving UP to (1,1) is not a corner.\n\nAlso, from (1,1), if for some reason I don't want to go to (0,1), I can go elsewhere, like towards (3,4) or up to (1,6).\n\nFor example, from (1,1), I could go UP to (1,2), then continue to (1,6).\n\nBut (0,1) is very close, so I should eat it.\n\nUnless there's a risk, but I don't see any.\n\nPerhaps the enemy might come down, but it's at (4,9), and apples are elsewhere.\n\nI think I should move LEFT to (0,0) to be closer to the apple.\n\nThen next turn, move UP to (0,1) to eat it.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's confirm the board: at (0,1) there is an apple, and no snake there.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (0,0): is (0,0) occupied? No, it's empty, as per the board state: at (0,0) it's '.' meaning empty.\n\nIn the board: at row 0, column 0: bottom left is (0,0), which has '.' and my snake is at (1,0) with '0', so (0,0) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is free.\n\nSo both moves are safe.\n\nBut to be in a better position after eating, moving to (1,1) first might be better because after eating at (0,1), if my body is at (1,1), I can only move UP or DOWN from (0,1), not RIGHT. Whereas if I move to (0,0) first, after eating at (0,1) with body at (0,0), I can move UP or RIGHT from (0,1).\n\nMoving RIGHT from (0,1) to (1,1) is possible only if body is not there.\n\nIn the first scenario: if I go to (1,1) then to (0,1), body at (1,1), so from (0,1) I cannot move RIGHT to (1,1) because body is there. I can only move UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0). DOWN to (0,0) is free, so I can move DOWN to (0,0), but (0,0) is empty, no body yet. Positions: after moving to (0,1) and eating, head at (0,1), body segment at (1,1). So (0,0) is empty, so I can move DOWN to (0,0), which is valid.\n\nThen I would be at (0,0) with body at (0,1) and (1,1)? Let's sequence:\n\nStart: head at (1,0), body empty.\n\nMove 1: UP to (1,1). Now head at (1,1), body still empty? No, when I move, since I didn't eat, the body doesn't grow. Since no apple at (1,1), I just move, so head moves to (1,1), and since no body, it's just head.\n\nThen move 2: LEFT to (0,1) and eat apple. Now, I grow, so head is at (0,1), and body is at (1,1). Positions: head (0,1), body [ (1,1) ]\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move:\n- UP to (0,2): empty\n- DOWN to (0,0): empty\n- LEFT: invalid\n- RIGHT to (1,1): but (1,1) is my body, so collision.\n\nSo I can only go UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,0), then head at (0,0), body at (0,1) and (1,1)? After moving to (0,0), the body moves: the segment at (1,1) moves to (0,1), so body is [ (0,1) ], head at (0,0). But (0,1) is the previous position.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. But since I have one body segment, after moving head to new position, the body segment moves to where head was.\n\nSo from head at (0,1), body at (1,1). If I move DOWN to (0,0), head to (0,0), then body moves to (0,1). So now head at (0,0), body at (0,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (0,2), head to (0,2), body to (0,1).\n\nNow, in the alternative first move: move LEFT to (0,0). Head at (0,0), no body. Then move UP to (0,1) eat apple. Now head at (0,1), body at (0,0).\n\nFrom (0,1), I can move:\n- UP to (0,2)\n- DOWN: invalid, since y=0 bottom, (0,0) is below? No, (0,1) to down is (0,0), but (0,0) is now my body, so collision if I go down.\n- LEFT: invalid\n- RIGHT to (1,1): empty\n\nSo I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (1,1) is good, as it frees me from the corner.\n\nWhereas in the first case, after eating via (1,1), I can only go UP or DOWN, both on the edge.\n\nSo to have more options after eating, it's better to move directly to (0,0) first, then to (0,1) eat, then I can go RIGHT to (1,1) to escape the corner.\n\nIf I go via (1,1) first, after eating at (0,1), I'm stuck on the left edge with only vertical moves.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (0,0) is better for post-apple flexibility.\n\nSo I should move LEFT.\n\nAdditionally, moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple immediately.\n\nWhat about other apples? (1,6) is also on my column, but I can get that later.\n\nEnemy snake might go for (7,9) or (7,2), but not immediate concern.\n\nSo decision: move LEFT to (0,0).\n\nThen next turn, move UP to (0,1) to eat.\n\nStrategy for next turn: after eating, go RIGHT to (1,1) to move away from corner and towards center or other apples.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to end with the direction.\n\n</think>\n\nI am playing as snake 0 at (1,0) with no body. The closest apple is at (0,1), which is only 2 steps away. Moving LEFT to (0,0) positions me directly below the apple, allowing me to eat it on the next move by going UP. This approach also provides better flexibility after eating, as I can then move RIGHT to (1,1) to avoid being trapped in the corner. Although moving UP to (1,1) is also possible, it would lead to fewer movement options after consuming the apple at (0,1). Therefore, I choose to move LEFT to efficiently secure the apple and set up for future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (0,0), plan to go UP to (0,1) to eat the apple, then RIGHT to (1,1) to access more open space and target other apples like (1,6) or (3,4).\n\nNext move: LEFT",

The previous move was justified to approach the apple at (1,6), but maybe it\u2019s better to refine this plan.\n\nConsidering safety:\n- Moving **LEFT** from (4,9): new position (3,9)\n  - This is safe, as no immediate obstacles, and still away from walls or enemies\n- Moving **RIGHT**: (5,9), also safe, and closer to the apple at (7,9)\n- Moving **UP**: riskier since we're at the top boundary, and there's no space beyond\n- Moving **DOWN**: from (4,9) to (4,8): clear, but maybe less promising because the closest apple (at 1,6) is down-left, and the apple at (3,4) is even further down-left.\n\nGiven the current context, approaching the apple at (7,9):\n- Moving RIGHT seems strategic, as it gets us closer to that apple\n- Moving LEFT would take us away from the nearer apple at (7,9), albeit safer if enemies are near\n\nBut the main goal seems to be to pursue the closest apples, especially ones that are reachable without risk.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Moving RIGHT from (4,9): (5,9), because (7,9) is two steps farther\n- Moving UP: blocked; at boundary\n- Moving DOWN: (4,8), safe and moving closer to (3,4), which is interesting because the apple is at (3,4)\n\nFrom the position (4,9):\n- Moving DOWN to (4,8) puts us closer to (3,4), which is at (3,4), a bit diagonally down-left.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Moving DOWN could be promising because:\n  - It moves the snake closer to an accessible apple\n  - It keeps us in the upper half of the board, away from enemy at (0,0) and other dangers\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT both can be considered, but RIGHT seems to be further away from immediate target\n- UP is not an option again due to boundary\n\nI think moving **DOWN** makes the most strategic sense now, as it continues to approach nearer to a promising apple at (3,4), while staying safe.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",

Apples are at (1,6), (0,1), (7,9), (7,2), and (3,4). Enemy snake #1 is at (3,9) with no body.\n\nBoard state:\n- My position: (0,0) - just moved there via LEFT from (1,0)\n- Enemy position: (3,9)\n\nApples:\n- (0,1) is directly above me at (0,0)\n- (1,6) is one right and six up from (0,0)\n- (3,4) is three right and four up\n- (7,2) is seven right and two up\n- (7,9) is seven right and nine up\n\nFrom my current position (0,0), possible moves:\n- UP: to (0,1) - this has an apple, so I can eat and grow\n- DOWN: to (0,-1) - invalid, out of bounds (y < 0)\n- LEFT: to (-1,0) - invalid, out of bounds (x < 0)\n- RIGHT: to (1,0) - which is empty now\n\nMoving UP to (0,1) immediately eats the apple, growing my snake. This gives me a point and adds a body segment at (0,0). After eating, I can move UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1) to avoid colliding with my new body at (0,0).\n\nOther apples are farther away. The enemy at (3,9) might target (7,9) or (3,4), but they are not immediate threats. Given (0,1) is adjacent, eating it now is optimal to grow and gain flexibility.\n\nStrategy after this move: After eating the apple at (0,1), I should avoid moving DOWN to (0,0) since that would cause a collision. Instead, move to (0,2) or (1,1) to access the center of the board. From there, target the next closest apple, like (1,6) or (3,4).\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the best choice.\n\n</think>\n\nI am now at (0,0) after moving LEFT. The apple at (0,1) is directly above me, so moving UP to (0,1) will allow me to eat it and grow. This is the most efficient move as it secures an apple in one step and starts my growth early. After eating, I will have a body segment at (0,0), so my next move should be UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1) to avoid collision and position for other apples.\n\nNext move: UP",

          "rationale": "<think> This is just a game and there's no harm in playing it to win.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current board state and my situation:\n- My snake (ID 0) is at position (0,1) with body segment at (0,0). That means my head is at (0,1) and my tail is at (0,0). The body is represented as [(0,0)] which is the tail.\n- Apples are at: (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (3,4), (5,3). Note that (5,3) is a new apple compared to last turn since I ate the one at (0,1) in the previous move.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (3,8) with body at [] \u2014 meaning it's just a head with no tail yet, so it hasn't eaten any apples.\n\nBoard visualization from the given state:\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .  \u2192 A at (7,9)\n 8 . . . 1 . . . . . .  \u2192 Snake #1 at (3,8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .  \u2192 A at (1,6)\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . . . . .  \u2192 A at (3,4)\n 3 . . . . . A . . . .  \u2192 A at (5,3) \u2014 wait, the apple list says (5,3), but in the board it's shown at (5,3) on y=3? Let me check coordinates.\nThe board is labeled with y from 0 at bottom to 9 at top. So row 3 is y=3, and the apple at (5,3) is at x=5, y=3.\n\nIn the board state:\nRow 3: . . . . . A . . . . \u2192 so at (5,3) there's an apple.\n\nAlso, row 1: \"1 0 . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 wait, that seems off. Let me read it properly:\nThe board is printed with y-axis descending from top to bottom? No, the user said: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" and the board is printed with row 9 at top.\n\nFrom the text:\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . . \u2192 so positions: (7,9) is apple.\nRow 8: . . . 1 . . . . . . \u2192 so (3,8) is snake #1.\nRow 7: all empty\nRow 6: . A . . . . . . . . \u2192 apple at (1,6)\nRow 5: empty\nRow 4: . . . A . . . . . . \u2192 apple at (3,4)\nRow 3: . . . . . A . . . . \u2192 apple at (5,3) \u2014 yes, (5,3)\nRow 2: . . . . . . . A . . \u2192 apple at (7,2)? But in the apple list it's (7,2), and row 2 is y=2, so (7,2) should be there. The text says row 2: \". . . . . . . A . .\" so yes, (7,2) is apple.\nRow 1: \"1 0 . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 row 1: positions from x=0 to x=9. At x=0: '0' which is my snake head at (0,1), and at x=1: '.'? But it says \"1 0\" \u2014 probably a typo or formatting. Actually, looking: \"1 0 . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 I think it means at (0,1) is '0' (my head), and at (1,1) is '.'? No: the row is for y=1, so:\n- Column 0: '0' \u2014 so (0,1) is my head.\n- Column 1: '.' \u2014 (1,1) empty.\nBut the body is at (0,0), which is row 0.\n\nRow 0: \"0 T . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 user said: \"0 T . . . . . . . .\" and then \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" for x-axis. So row 0: at x=0: 'T'? That might be the tail. User said: snake body at [(0,0)], so at (0,0) it's the tail.\n\nIn the board:\n- Row 9: (7,9) apple\n- Row 8: (3,8) snake #1\n- Row 6: (1,6) apple\n- Row 4: (3,4) apple\n- Row 3: (5,3) apple\n- Row 2: (7,2) apple\n- Row 1: (0,1) my head (snake 0)\n- Row 0: (0,0) my tail (T)\n\nSo, my current position: head at (0,1), body segment at (0,0). From last move, I moved UP to (0,1) and ate the apple, so now I have a body at (0,0).\n\nNow, possible moves from (0,1):\n- UP: to (0,2) \u2014 is this empty? Yes, from board, row 2 has nothing at (0,2)? Row 2 is y=2, and in the board, for x=0, y=2: row 2 is \". . . . . . . A . .\" \u2014 so (0,2) should be '.'? But row 2 is printed as starting with '.', so (0,2) is empty. Similarly, row 1 has my head at (0,1), and row 0 has tail at (0,0). So moving UP to (0,2) is safe and empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,0) \u2014 but (0,0) is my own tail. Is this a collision? Typically in Snake, moving into your own tail causes death, but after eating, the tail is still there until you move. Rules say: \"If you run into ... yourself (like go backwards), you die.\" So moving DOWN to (0,0) would be colliding with my own body segment and I die. So DOWN is not possible.\n- LEFT: to (-1,0) \u2014 out of bounds, x<0, so die. Invalid.\n- RIGHT: to (1,1) \u2014 from board, row 1: at x=1, it's '.', so empty and valid.\n\nSo possible moves: UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1). DOWN and LEFT are invalid.\n\nNow, I need to choose between UP and RIGHT. Let's consider the apples and strategy.\n\nApples available:\n- (1,6): one right and five up from (0,1) \u2014 distance: dx=1, dy=5\n- (7,9): seven right and eight up \u2014 far\n- (7,2): seven right and one down? From (0,1) to (7,2): dx=7, dy=1 (since y from 1 to 2 is up? No: y increases up, so (0,1) to (7,2) is +7 in x, +1 in y \u2014 but (7,2) is at y=2, which is above y=1? Yes, y=1 to y=2 is up. Distance: Manhattan |7-0| + |2-1| = 7+1=8\n- (3,4): three right, three up \u2014 dx=3, dy=3\n- (5,3): five right, two up \u2014 dx=5, dy=2 (since y=3 - y=1 = 2 up)\n\nClosest apples by Manhattan distance from (0,1):\n- (1,6): |1-0| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n- (3,4): |3-0| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- (5,3): |5-0| + |3-1| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- (7,2): |7-0| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n- (7,9): |7-0| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15\n\nSo (1,6) and (3,4) are both distance 6, (5,3) is 7, etc.\n\nNow, moving UP to (0,2) gets me closer to (1,6) since (1,6) is at y=6, so moving up is in that general direction. From (0,2), I can then go right towards (1,6).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,1) gets me closer to (3,4) and (5,3), since (1,1) is one step right.\n\nBut also, there's apple at (1,6) which is at (1,6), so if I move RIGHT to (1,1), then I can go up to (1,2), (1,3), etc. to reach (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is at (3,4), so from (1,1), I can go right and up.\n\nNow, enemy snake: at (3,8). It might be targeting apples like (7,9) or (3,4). (3,4) is close to it: distance |3-3| + |4-8| = 0 + 4 = 4, so it could go down to (3,4) quickly. But it has no body, so it might go for the nearest apple. Nearest apple to it: (3,4) is |dy|=4 down, (1,6) is |dx=2| + |dy=2| = 4, (5,3) is |dx=2| + |dy=5| =7, etc. So (3,4) or (1,6) are equally close for it, but since it's at y=8, going down to (3,4) might be easier.\n\nBut I am at (0,1), so I am far from (3,4) for now.\n\nMy priority should be to get apples quickly to grow and gain points. The apple at (1,6) is very close in terms of vertical movement. If I go UP to (0,2), then I can continue UP to (0,3), (0,4), etc. to (0,6), then RIGHT to (1,6). That would take 5 moves up and 1 right, total 6 moves.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (1,6): \n- One way: UP to (0,2), UP to (0,3), UP to (0,4), UP to (0,5), UP to (0,6), then RIGHT to (1,6). But at (0,6), I eat apple at (1,6) by moving right.\n\nBut (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so moving from (0,6) to (1,6) is right.\n\nSimilarly, I could go RIGHT first to (1,1), then UP to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). That's 1 right + 5 up = 6 moves same as above.\n\nBut if I go UP to (0,2), then I have the option to go to other places too.\n\nAnother apple: (5,3) is at x=5,y=3. From (0,1), moving right gets me closer horizontally.\n\nBut (1,6) is closer in Manhattan distance and directly accessible via up/right.\n\nI should also consider the board boundaries. Since I am at left edge, moving right opens up more space.\n\nEnemy snake: at (3,8). It can move in any direction since it has no body. Possible moves for it: UP to (3,9) \u2014 but (3,9) might be out of y-range? y=9 is top, so UP to (3,9) is valid? y from 0 to 9, so (3,9) is top row, valid. But no apple there. DOWN to (3,7), LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8), etc. It might go for (3,4) by moving down repeatedly, which takes 4 moves down to (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, I might not get to (3,4) before it if I go that way.\n\nBut (1,6) is farther for the enemy: from (3,8) to (1,6): |3-1| + |8-6| =2+2=4 moves, same as to (3,4). So it could go for either.\n\nTo avoid competition, I might go for (1,6) since it's in my corner.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), I can go for (5,3) or (3,4) if available.\n\nNow, moving from (0,1):\n\nOption 1: UP to (0,2)\n- Position: (0,2) \u2014 safe, empty\n- Then from there, I can go UP again to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,2)\n\nOption 2: RIGHT to (1,1)\n- Position: (1,1) \u2014 safe, empty\n- Then I can go UP to (1,2) or RIGHT to (2,1), etc.\n\nBoth seem fine, but moving UP keeps me near the left edge, which might be risky if I need to escape, but since no other snakes are close, it might be ok.\n\nMoving RIGHT gets me away from the edge and towards the center, which is generally better for flexibility.\n\nAlso, from (1,1), I have more options: I can go to (1,6) by moving up, or to (3,4) by moving right and up.\n\nFrom (0,2), I am still on the edge.\n\nMoreover, if I go UP to (0,2), then my body is at (0,1) and (0,0). So if I go to (0,3), I am on a vertical line, which might limit movement.\n\nWhereas if I go RIGHT to (1,1), I am at (1,1) with body at (0,1) and (0,0), so I can move freely except back left or down.\n\nI think moving RIGHT is slightly better for positioning.\n\nBut let me check the apple at (5,3): it's at y=3, and I am at y=1, so moving up might be better if I plan to go for it.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, from (0,1): if I go right, I get closer in x.\n\nFor example, from (1,1) to (5,3): I need to go right 4 and up 2.\n\nFrom (0,2) to (5,3): right 5 and up 1, which is worse.\n\nTo reach (1,6), from (0,2) and (1,1) it's similar.\n\nBut there's another apple at (7,2) which is at y=2, same as moving up to (0,2) would be y=2, but (7,2) is far right.\n\nNot relevant yet.\n\nI think moving RIGHT to (1,1) is a good choice because:\n- It moves me away from the left edge.\n- It positions me to easily go towards (1,6) by moving up, or towards (3,4) or (5,3) by moving right.\n- It avoids being stuck on the edge.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,2), I might have to move right eventually to get to (1,6), so it's similar, but I delay leaving the edge.\n\nAlso, by moving right, I reduce the Manhattan distance to multiple apples: to (3,4) from (1,1) is |3-1| + |4-1| =2+3=5, whereas from (0,2) to (3,4) is |3-0| + |4-2| =3+2=5 same. But to (5,3) from (1,1) is |5-1| + |3-1| =4+2=6, from (0,2) is |5-0| + |3-2| =5+1=6 same. To (1,6) from (1,1) is |1-1| + |6-1| =0+5=5, from (0,2) to (1,6) is |1-0| + |6-2| =1+4=5 same.\n\nSo no difference in distance, but moving right gives me more space.\n\nMoreover, if I move right to (1,1), then the position (0,1) becomes my body, so if I ever go back left, I might collide, but I don't plan to.\n\nI think RIGHT is a solid move.\n\nBut let's see the enemy: at (3,8). It might move towards (3,4) quickly. But I am not going to (3,4) immediately, so it might eat it before I can, but that's fine, there are other apples.\n\nI could go for (1,6) first to secure it.\n\nSince (1,6) is close and in my path, I should aim for it.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can go directly up to (1,2), (1,3), etc. to (1,6) without issue.\n\nSimilarly from (0,2), I can go up to (0,6) then right to (1,6), but that might be slower if there are obstacles, but no obstacles shown.\n\nI think either is fine, but moving right now seems better for long-term mobility.\n\nI'll go with RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving to (1,1), assess the board. If nothing changes, move UP to (1,2) to head towards (1,6). If an apple appears closer or enemy moves, adjust.\n\nSo move: RIGHT\nensored_think>\nI am currently at (0,1) with my body segment at (0,0) after eating the apple last turn. Available moves:\n- UP to (0,2): Empty, safe, and moves me toward the apple at (1,6) by increasing y.\n- DOWN to (0,0): Collides with my own body segment (tail), causing death\u2014invalid.\n- LEFT to (-1,0): Out of bounds (x < 0), invalid.\n- RIGHT to (1,1): Empty, safe, and positions me away from the left edge for better access to apples like (1,6), (3,4), and (5,3).\n\nApples: (1,6) is closest (Manhattan distance 6), followed by (3,4) (distance 6) and (5,3) (distance 7). Moving RIGHT to (1,1) reduces x-distance to these apples and improves board flexibility vs. staying on the edge with UP. Enemy snake at (3,8) may target (3,4) or (1,6), so I should prioritize (1,6) as it's in my corner. RIGHT allows direct upward path to (1,6) next. Strategy: From (1,1), move UP to (1,2) toward (1,6) unless board changes.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

Moving UP isn't an option due to boundary.\n\nGiven that the move DOWN is safe and strategic, aiming to approach the apple at (3,4) in later moves, it seems like a solid choice.\n\nNext strategy:\n- Continue prioritizing moving toward apples that are reachable in the shortest path.\n- After moving down, evaluate the best route toward the nearest apples.\n- Keep avoiding walls and enemy snakes.\n\nDecision:\n- Move DOWN.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",

The apples are at (1, 6), (7, 9), (7, 2), (3, 4), and (5, 3). The enemy snake is at (3, 7) with no body segments.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (1, 1):\n- UP: (1, 2) \u2013 appears empty on the board.\n- DOWN: (1, 0) \u2013 should be empty since the board shows nothing at that position.\n- LEFT: (0, 1) \u2013 this is my own tail segment. Moving here would cause a collision with myself and kill me.\n- RIGHT: (2, 1) \u2013 appears empty.\n\nSo LEFT is invalid. UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are all valid moves.\n\nNow, I need to choose the best move to maximize points and avoid death. The closest apples are:\n- (1, 6): Manhattan distance |1-1| + |6-1| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- (5, 3): |5-1| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (3, 4): |3-1| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nBoth (1, 6) and (3, 4) are equally close at distance 5. My strategy should be to go for (1, 6) first since it's directly above me and requires no horizontal movement. Moving UP repeatedly would get me there in 5 moves.\n\nIf I move UP now to (1, 2), I reduce the distance to (1, 6) to 4. This is efficient and keeps me aligned vertically with the apple.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 0) would take me away from all apples except (7, 2), which is farther away (distance |7-1| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8). This seems inefficient.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 1) gets me closer to (3, 4) and (5, 3) but adds horizontal distance to (1, 6). It might be a viable alternative if I want to target those apples, but (1, 6) is the most straightforward target.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 7) and may target (3, 4) or (1, 6). (1, 6) is closer to me (distance 5) than to the enemy (|3-1| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 moves away if it moves optimally). However, since I am already on the same x-coordinate as (1, 6), I can reach it in 5 moves while the enemy would need at least 3 moves to get there\u2014but it might not target it immediately. I should secure (1, 6) quickly to prevent the enemy from taking it.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the best choice to efficiently target the closest apple and minimize risk. After reaching (1, 6), I can reassess for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving UP toward (1, 6) unless the board changes significantly. Avoid moving toward the enemy or into confined spaces.\n</thinking>\n<move>\nUP\n</move>",

Moving down would put me on (1,1), which is my own body. That would cause a collision and death. So invalid.\n- LEFT: (0,2) \u2013 empty? The board shows nothing at (0,2) in the state.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) \u2013 empty.\n\nSo DOWN is invalid. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are possible.\n\nNow, which move is best?\n\nTargeting apples:\n- (1,6): vertical from me. Moving UP would get me closer. Distance: |1-1| + |6-2| = 4.\n- (3,4): |3-1| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- (5,3): |5-1| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n- (7,2): |7-1| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6.\n- (7,9): too far.\n\n(1,6) and (3,4) are equally close at distance 4. (5,3) is 5 away.\n\nMoving UP: reduces distance to (1,6) to 3, and to (3,4) to 5 (since |3-1| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3? Wait, after moving to (1,3), distance to (3,4) becomes |3-1| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3). So both become distance 3? Let me recalculate:\n\nFrom (1,2):\n- To (1,6): |1-1| + |6-2| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- To (3,4): |3-1| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nFrom (1,3) after moving UP:\n- To (1,6): 0 + 3 = 3\n- To (3,4): 2 + 1 = 3\n\nAlso, (5,3) from (1,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4 + 0 = 4 (same as before? Wait: from (1,2) to (5,3) was 4+1=5, from (1,3) to (5,3) is 4+0=4). So (5,3) becomes closer too.\n\nBut moving UP gets me closer to (1,6) and (5,3) directly, and (3,4) is also closer.\n\nWhat about moving RIGHT to (2,2)? Then:\n- To (1,6): |1-2| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5 (worse)\n- To (3,4): |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 (same as before? Wait: from (2,2) to (3,4) is |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, but from (1,2) it was 2+2=4, so actually better for (3,4))\n- To (5,3): |5-2| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 (same as if I move UP? Wait from (1,3) to (5,3) is 4, from (2,2) to (5,3) is 3+1=4, same)\n\nSo moving RIGHT might be better for (3,4) and (5,3), but worse for (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (0,2):\n- To (1,6): 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (3,4): 3 + 2 = 5\n- Worse for both.\n\nSo UP is best for (1,6) and (5,3), and RIGHT is best for (3,4).\n\nNow, enemy position: at (3,6). It might target (3,4) or (1,6). To (3,4): |3-3| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2 moves. To (1,6): |1-3| + |6-6| = 2 + 0 = 2 moves. So both apples are 2 moves away for the enemy.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,3), I will be 3 moves from (1,6). The enemy can reach (1,6) in 2 moves, so it might get there first. Similarly, for (3,4), enemy can get it in 2 moves while I would be 3 moves away after moving UP.\n\nBut if I move RIGHT to (2,2), then to (3,4) is 2 moves (RIGHT to (3,2) then UP to (3,3) and UP to (3,4) \u2014 that's 2 moves? Wait, from (2,2) to (3,4) requires moving right once and up twice, so 3 moves. Actually, Manhattan distance is 2? |3-2| + |4-2| = 1+2=3 moves minimum? No, each move changes one coordinate by one, so the number of moves is the Manhattan distance. So from (2,2) to (3,4) is 1+2=3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, enemy from (3,6) to (3,4) is 2 moves down (to (3,5) then (3,4)).\n\nSo enemy will get to (3,4) in 2 moves, and I can't get there in time. Similarly, for (1,6): enemy can get there in 2 moves while I need 3 after moving UP. So both apples might be taken by the enemy.\n\nBut there are other apples: (5,3) and (7,2). (5,3) is at distance 5 from me initially, and from (1,3) it's 4. Enemy to (5,3) is |3-5| + |6-3| = 2+3=5 moves, so I might have a chance.\n\nAlternatively, (7,2) is at distance 6 from me, and enemy is |3-7| + |6-2| = 4+4=8 moves away, so I could target that safely.\n\nBut (7,2) is far. (5,3) is closer.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid competing with the enemy for the close apples and go for (5,3) or (7,2).\n\nAfter moving UP to (1,3):\n- Distance to (5,3): 4 (horizontal move only)\n- Then I can move right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) in 4 moves.\n\nEnemy might not go for (5,3) immediately because it has closer options.\n\nBut if enemy takes (3,4) and (1,6), then those are gone, and I have to go elsewhere.\n\nAnother apple at (7,9) is very far.\n\nBut there's also (7,2) which is at (7,2). From me, distance 6, from enemy 8.\n\nSo perhaps I should target (5,3). Moving UP to (1,3) then right.\n\nBut moving RIGHT now to (2,2) might set me on a path to (5,3) as well: from (2,2) to (5,3) is 3 moves: right to (3,2), right to (4,2), right to (5,2), then up to (5,3) \u2014 that's 4 moves? Or from (2,2) to (5,3) is |5-2| + |3-2| = 3+1=4 moves.\n\nSame as from (1,3): |5-1| + |3-3| = 4+0=4 moves.\n\nSo both moves get me to (5,3) in 4 moves.\n\nBut with UP, I also have the option to go for (1,6) if the enemy doesn't take it. With RIGHT, I can go for (3,4) if available.\n\nBut enemy will likely take (1,6) and (3,4) first.\n\nSo perhaps I should go for (5,3) regardless of the move, but I need to choose a direction.\n\nLet's consider risk: moving UP to (1,3) is safe because it's empty. Moving RIGHT to (2,2) is also safe.\n\nBut moving LEFT to (0,2) is also safe, but takes me away from most apples.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT, which is better?\n\nIf I move UP to (1,3), I am closer to the top and might get boxed in if the enemy comes. But the board is open.\n\nI think UP is fine.\n\nBut let me check the board again:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . 1 . . . . . .   [enemy at (3,6) is snake #1, head only]\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . A . . . . . .   [apple at (3,4)]\n 3 . . . . . A . . . .   [apple at (5,3)]\n 2 . 0 . . . . . A . .   [I am at (1,2) with head, and tail at (1,1) is 'T']\n 1 . T . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nAfter my move, if I go UP to (1,3), the board will show my head at (1,3) and body at (1,2), and tail at (1,1).\n\nEnemy will move simultaneously.\n\nI should assume the enemy might go for (3,4) by moving down to (3,5) or (3,4) directly? It can move down to (3,5) or left/right/down.\n\nPossible moves for enemy at (3,6):\n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2013 safe, gets closer to (3,4)\n- LEFT: (2,6) \u2013 safe\n- RIGHT: (4,6) \u2013 safe\n- UP: (3,7) \u2013 but that's where it came from? Or is it? The board shows only head at (3,6), so no body, so UP to (3,7) is safe.\n\nBut (3,4) is below, so DOWN is logical.\n\nSimilarly, for me, I want to avoid conflict.\n\nPerhaps go for (5,3) by moving RIGHT to (2,2), then continue right.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), then up to (5,3).\n\nBut enemy might not go that way.\n\nAlternatively, move UP to (1,3), then right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut if I go UP, I can also consider going to (1,6) if the enemy doesn't take it immediately.\n\nThe enemy might not go for (1,6) because it has (3,4) closer? Wait, both are distance 2 for enemy, but (3,4) is directly below, so more natural.\n\nSo enemy will likely go down to (3,5) or (3,4) next.\n\nIf it goes down to (3,5), then it can get (3,4) the following move.\n\n(1,6) might be free for one more turn.\n\nBut if I go UP to (1,3), I am still 3 moves from (1,6), and enemy can get to (1,6) in 2 moves: from (3,6) to (2,6) then (1,6) or (3,6) to (3,5) then (3,6) to (2,6) in one move, then to (1,6) in second move. Or (3,6) to (2,6) in one, then (2,6) to (1,6) in another.\n\nSo if enemy moves left twice, it can take (1,6) in two moves.\n\nI can only get there in three moves after moving UP.\n\nSo it will get there first.\n\nTherefore, (1,6) is not safe to target.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) will be taken by enemy.\n\nSo I should target (5,3) or (7,2).\n\n(5,3) is closer.\n\nSo I should move either UP or RIGHT to start heading toward (5,3).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,2) gets me closer horizontally to (5,3), and I can then move right and up.\n\nMoving UP to (1,3) also allows me to move right along y=3.\n\nThe path from (1,3) to (5,3) is direct right on the same row, which is efficient.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (5,3) I have to go up at some point.\n\nBut the distance is the same.\n\nHowever, moving UP to (1,3) puts me at y=3, which is the same y as (5,3), so I can go straight right without changing y.\n\nFrom (2,2), I would need to go up to y=3 at some point.\n\nSo it's more efficient to be at the same y.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (1,3) and then right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) is a straight line.\n\nWhereas from (2,2), I might go to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), then up to (5,3) or go to (2,3) then right.\n\nBut the number of moves is the same: 4 moves from (1,2) to (5,3) regardless of path.\n\nBut with UP first, I stay at y=3, which might be safer or more efficient.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (7,2) if I want to go further.\n\nBut for now, (5,3) is a good target.\n\nEnemy might not go for (5,3) immediately because it has to go through (3,4) or other paths.\n\nAfter taking (3,4), enemy might go for (5,3) or (7,9), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is closer to me.\n\nSo I think moving UP is a good start to target (5,3).\n\nI could move RIGHT to start, but UP aligns me better.\n\nAnother point: if I move UP to (1,3), then I am at (1,3), and my tail is at (1,2) and (1,1). So I have a body segment behind me.\n\nBut if I move RIGHT to (2,2), I leave my tail at (1,1) and (1,2), so I am expanding.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nI think UP is slightly better for the alignment.\n\nAlso, if the enemy takes (1,6), it might come down to (1,5) or something, but I will be moving right, so not an issue.\n\nSo I decide to move UP.\n\nTherefore, the next move is UP.\n\nFor next turn, strategy: if I move UP to (1,3), then next move I can go RIGHT toward (5,3) unless the board changes.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

For the purposes of this decision, I'll assume the current position of the snake is at (3,5), as given, and the last move was DOWN, so from (3,6).\n\nHowever, checking the board, the snake's position is at (3,5), with the last move being DOWN, which would have taken it from (3,6) to (3,5). That matches.\n\nNow, focusing on the current position (3,5):\n\n- Cells around:\n\n  - Up: (3,6)\n\n  - Down: (3,4)\n\n  - Left: (2,5)\n\n  - Right: (4,5)\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (3,6): seems empty.\n\n- (3,4): empty or no info about obstacles.\n\n- (2,5): seems empty.\n\n- (4,5): seems empty.\n\nThe immediate danger is hitting walls or enemy snakes.\n\n- Walls are at coordinate boundaries: x=0 or x=9; y=0 or y=9.\n\n- Checking potential moves:\n\n  - Up: (3,6): safe, as y=6 and within range.\n\n  - Down: (3,4): safe, within range, no immediate obstacle.\n\n  - Left: (2,5): safe.\n\n  - Right: (4,5): safe.\n\nIs any apple reachable nearby? Apples are at:\n\n(1, 6), (7, 9), (7, 2), (3, 4), (5, 3)\n\nFrom current position (3,5):\n\n- Going down to (3,4): about to reach an apple at (3,4). That is a good opportunity for growth.\n\n- Moving up to (3,6): no apple but might open a path.\n\n- Moving left to (2,5): no apple.\n\n- Moving right to (4,5): no apple.\n\nIf the goal is to pick up apples efficiently, moving down to (3,4) seems advantageous, especially since there's an apple there.\n\nAlso, moving down:\n\n- From (3,5) to (3,4) will give us an apple, causing the snake to grow.\n\nTherefore, the best move seems to be moving DOWN to reach that apple directly.\n\nNext, in subsequent moves, I can plan to navigate toward other apples strategically, but for now, prioritizing the current apple is sensible.\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",

Collision would occur, so invalid.\n- LEFT: (0,3) \u2013 empty based on board state.\n- RIGHT: (2,3) \u2013 empty.\n\nDOWN is invalid. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are possible.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Apples: (1,6) is 3 moves away (UP thrice), (3,4) is 3 moves (RIGHT twice then DOWN once? Better: RIGHT to (2,3), RIGHT to (3,3), DOWN to (3,4) \u2013 but DOWN from (3,3) to (3,4) is increasing y? Coordinates: y increases up. So from (3,3) to (3,4) is UP, not DOWN. Clarify:\n  - (3,4) is at x=3,y=4. From (1,3): move RIGHT to (2,3), then RIGHT to (3,3), then UP to (3,4). Manhattan distance |3-1| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 moves.\n- (5,3) is 4 moves (RIGHT four times from (1,3) to (5,3) same y).\n- (7,2) is 6 moves (RIGHT then DOWN).\n- (7,9) too far.\n\nEnemy snake (#1) at (3,5):\n- Can reach (3,4) in 1 move (DOWN to (3,4) since y decreases down? From (3,5) to (3,4) is decreasing y, so DOWN. Distance 1.\n- Can reach (1,6) in 3 moves: e.g., LEFT to (2,5), LEFT to (1,5), UP to (1,6).\n\nSince (3,4) is very close to enemy, it will likely take it next move. (1,6) is safer for me to target if enemy doesn't prioritize it, but enemy might go for (3,4) first then other apples.\n\nMy best apple targets:\n- Avoid competing for (3,4) as enemy will get it first.\n- (1,6) is risky but possible if enemy moves elsewhere. Distance for me: 3 moves (UP thrice).\n- (5,3) is safer: enemy distance |3-5| + |5-3| = 2+2=4 moves, so I can reach it faster or equal.\n  - Specifically, from me at (1,3) to (5,3): 4 RIGHT moves.\n  - From enemy at (3,5) to (5,3): e.g., RIGHT to (4,5), RIGHT to (5,5), DOWN to (5,4), DOWN to (5,3) \u2013 4 moves, or shorter paths? Shortest is 4 moves since |\u0394x|=2, |\u0394y|=2.\n- (7,2) is 6 moves for me, 8 for enemy, so very safe but inefficient.\n\nOptimal path to (5,3):\n- Moving RIGHT now starts the horizontal approach directly. From (1,3) to (2,3) reduces distance to (5,3) by 1.\n- Moving UP would get closer to (1,6) but risk enemy contention.\n- Moving LEFT takes me away.\n\nTherefore, best move is RIGHT to position for (5,3).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- After RIGHT to (2,3), my body will be at [(1,3), (1,2)] \u2013 no immediate self-collision risk.\n- Board safety: (2,3) is empty per current state.\n\nEnemy will likely take (3,4) next, removing that apple. Then I can focus on (5,3).\n\nFor next turn, I'll continue RIGHT toward (5,3) unless new apples or threats emerge.\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\nStrategy: Move RIGHT to align horizontally with (5,3) apple and avoid enemy competition for closer apples.

On the board, our current position is at (3,5), so moving down from there would be to (3,4).\n\n- Looking around:\n\n  - Up: (3,6) \u2014 appears free, no immediate obstacle.\n  \n  - Down: (3,4) \u2014 seems free and has an apple at (3,4), which is directly below. Moving down would immediately eat this apple and grow.\n  \n  - Left: (2,5) \u2014 seems open; no immediate threat.\n  \n  - Right: (4,5) \u2014 also open; no immediate threat.\n\n- The apple at (3,4) is directly below us, and moving down would result in eating it right away, increasing our length and points. It's a good immediate target.\n\n- Safety considerations:\n\n  - Moving down to (3,4) looks safe: no walls or enemy snake bodies indicated in that cell. Our own body is only at (3,5), which we'd be moving onto only if we step into that cell (we're at (3,5), moving down to (3,4))\u2014which is safe.\n\n  - Moving up to (3,6) is safe. However, it doesn't lead directly to an apple; more moves would be needed, possibly exposing us to risk.\n\n  - Moving left or right is safe but doesn\u2019t bring us closer to apples. \n\n- Strategy:\n\n  - Eating the apple at (3,4) now gives us a growth opportunity immediately.\n\n  - After that, we should plan moves toward other apples, perhaps the one at (1,6) or (7,9), depending on future movements, while avoiding enemy snakes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMoving DOWN into (3,4) to consume the nearby apple is the optimal immediate choice, aligning with the goal to quickly eat apples and grow.\n\n**Next move:** DOWN",

Wait, no\u2014last turn: I was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], moved RIGHT to (2,3). Now body should be at [(1,3), (1,2)]? But according to the board state provided, after last move, my snake is at (2,3) with body at [(1,3)]. The body part at (1,2) is gone? That doesn't make sense. Let me check the rules: when you move, the tail follows unless you eat an apple. Last turn I didn't eat an apple, so the tail should move. From (1,3) head, body at (1,2), then move RIGHT to (2,3). New head at (2,3), body becomes [(1,3)], and the tail at (1,2) moves away? But the board state shows \"Your snake ID: 0 which is currently positioned at (2, 3) with body at [(1, 3)]\". That implies the body is only one segment, meaning I had a length of 2 including head, and after moving, head is at (2,3), body at (1,3). The previous tail (1,2) is no longer part of me because I didn't eat an apple. Yes, that's correct. Snakes grow only when they eat an apple; otherwise, they move and the tail leaves the previous position.\n\nSo current:\n- My head: (2,3)\n- Body: [(1,3)]  (so total length 2)\n- Apples: (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6) \u2013 wait, the list is (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6). But earlier I thought (3,4) was an apple, but it's not listed? In the board state, at (3,4) there is no apple; apples are at (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6). I misread earlier.\n\nBoard state visual:\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .  # A at (7,9)\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A A . . . . . . . .  # A at (0,6) and (1,6)? Wait, \"A A\" at row 6, so (0,6) and (1,6) both have apples? But it says \"Apples at: (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6)\" \u2013 so yes, (0,6) and (1,6) are both apples.\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .  # T at (3,5) \u2013 what is T? In the legend: \"T\" is tail? But enemy snake #1 is at (3,5) with body at [(3,6)]? Wait, the board says at row 5: \". . . T . . . . . .\" at x=3,y=5. And enemy snake #1 position: head at (3,5) with body at [(3,6)]? The board row 5 y=5, column x=3 is T. Then row 4 y=4: at x=3, it's '1', which might be the head? No:\n\nLet's read the board properly:\nRow 9 (top): . . . . . . . A . .  # so (7,9) apple\nRow 8: all .\nRow 7: all .\nRow 6: A A . . . . . . . .  # so (0,6) and (1,6) apples\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .  # so at (3,5) there is T\nRow 4: . . . 1 . . . . . .  # at (3,4) there is '1'\nRow 3: . T 0 . . A . . . .  # at (1,3) is T, at (2,3) is 0 (my head), at (5,3) is A (apple)\nRow 2: . . . . . . . A . .  # at (7,2) apple\nRow 1: all .\nRow 0: all .\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at position (3,4) with body at [(3,5)] \u2013 so head at (3,4), body at (3,5). That means:\n- At (3,4): head of snake 1\n- At (3,5): body segment of snake 1, which is shown as 'T' on the board? But row 5 is y=5, and (3,5) is at row 5, x=3, which has 'T'. Probably 'T' means tail or body. Similarly, my position: head at (2,3) shown as '0', body at (1,3) shown as 'T' (since at row 3, x=1 is T).\n\nSo apples: (0,6), (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3) \u2013 five apples.\n\nMy current position: head at (2,3), body at (1,3).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (2,4) \u2013 check board: row 4 is y=4, at x=2 it's '.' in row 4? Row 4: \". . . 1 . . . . . .\" \u2013 so (2,4) is '.' meaning empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) \u2013 row 2 is y=2: \". . . . . . . A . .\" \u2013 at x=2, it's '.' (since A is at x=7). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) \u2013 but (1,3) is my body segment. Collision with self, invalid.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) \u2013 row 3: \". T 0 . . A . . . .\" \u2013 at x=3, it's '.' (after 0 at x=2, then '.' at x=3). Safe.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, apples:\n- (5,3) is at same y=3, x=5. Distance |5-2| + |3-3| = 3 moves RIGHT.\n- (0,6) and (1,6) at y=6: (0,6) is distance |0-2| + |6-3| = 2+3=5 moves, (1,6) is |1-2| + |6-3| =1+3=4 moves.\n- (7,2) at y=2, x=7: |7-2| + |2-3| =5+1=6 moves.\n- (7,9) too far.\n\nEnemy snake #1: head at (3,4), body at (3,5). Possible moves for enemy:\n- From (3,4): \n  - UP: (3,5) \u2013 but (3,5) is its own body, so collision, invalid.\n  - DOWN: (3,3) \u2013 empty per board.\n  - LEFT: (2,4) \u2013 empty.\n  - RIGHT: (4,4) \u2013 empty.\n\nEnemy can move DOWN to (3,3), LEFT to (2,4), or RIGHT to (4,4). Cannot go UP.\n\nImportant: (5,3) apple is very close to me. I can reach it in 3 moves if I go RIGHT repeatedly. Enemy is at (3,4), which is one step away from (3,3), but (3,3) is not an apple. The apple at (5,3) is at y=3, so if enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), it will be at (3,3), then it can move RIGHT to (4,3) then to (5,3) to eat the apple in 2 more moves (total 3 moves from now). Similarly, I can go RIGHT to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3) in 3 moves. But if enemy moves to (3,3) now, it might block me or compete.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,3) this turn:\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), we collide head-on immediately, both die? Or since we move simultaneously, if we both move to same cell, collision occurs. So if I move RIGHT to (3,3) and enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), we both die. Bad.\n\nEnemy might not move to (3,3). It could go LEFT to (2,4) or RIGHT to (4,4). But I can't predict.\n\nTo avoid risk, better not to go to (3,3) directly if there's a chance enemy moves there.\n\nAlternative paths to (5,3):\n- I can go UP to (2,4), then RIGHT to (3,4) but (3,4) is enemy head, so collision. Not good.\n- Or go UP to (2,4), then to (2,5), etc., but that takes me away from (5,3).\n\nGo DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (5,2), then UP to (5,3). But that takes 4 moves, and enemy could get there first.\n\nSafest: since (5,3) is at y=3, I should stay at y=3 and move RIGHT, but avoid (3,3) if possible. But from (2,3), to reach (5,3), I must pass (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). No other direct horizontal path.\n\nPerhaps I can go RIGHT to (3,3) but only if I think enemy won't go there. But enemy might go there to avoid me or to get to lower y.\n\nConsider enemy's perspective: enemy head at (3,4), body at (3,5). It cannot go UP (body there). Apples: closest are (5,3) which is |5-3| + |3-4| =2+1=3 moves, or (1,6) which is |1-3| + |6-4| =2+2=4 moves. So (5,3) is attractive. To reach (5,3), enemy could:\n- Move DOWN to (3,3) \u2013 then next moves RIGHT to (4,3) and (5,3). 3 moves total.\n- Move RIGHT to (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3) \u2013 also 3 moves.\n- Move LEFT to (2,4), then DOWN to (2,3) \u2013 but (2,3) is my head, collision if it moves there while I'm there? But I'm at (2,3) now, and enemy moving to (2,4) or (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), it can progress to (5,3). If I move RIGHT to (3,3), we collide.\n\nTo prevent collision, I could let enemy go first or take a different route.\n\nSince (1,6) apple is available, I could go for that instead. Distance: from (2,3) to (1,6): |1-2| + |6-3| =1+3=4 moves. E.g., LEFT? But LEFT from (2,3) is (1,3) which is my body, invalid. So I can't go directly left. I must go UP or DOWN first.\n\nTo reach (1,6):\n- Option 1: UP to (2,4), then LEFT? LEFT from (2,4) to (1,4) \u2013 is (1,4) empty? Row 4: at x=1, y=4, it's '.' (row 4: \". . . 1 . . . . . .\" \u2013 dots at x=0,1,2 except at x=3 it's '1'). So (1,4) empty. Then UP to (1,5), then UP to (1,6). 3 moves: UP, LEFT, UP? But after UP to (2,4), then LEFT to (1,4), then UP to (1,5), then UP to (1,6). 4 moves.\n\n- Option 2: UP to (2,4), UP to (2,5), LEFT to (1,5), UP to (1,6). Also 4 moves.\n\nEnemy could also go for (1,6): from (3,4) to (1,6): |1-3| + |6-4| =2+2=4 moves. E.g., LEFT to (2,4), LEFT to (1,4), UP to (1,5), UP to (1,6). Or other paths.\n\nSo both can reach (1,6) in 4 moves, but I have a head start? No, we move simultaneously.\n\n(0,6) apple is also there, but similar distance.\n\nPerhaps (5,3) is better because I can get there in 3 moves if unopposed, and enemy might not block.\n\nBut to minimize risk, I should not move to (3,3) if enemy might be there.\n\nAnother idea: move DOWN to (2,2) to avoid the (3,3) cell and approach (5,3) from below.\n\nPath: DOWN to (2,2), then RIGHT to (3,2), RIGHT to (4,2), RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3). 4 moves to eat apple.\n\nEnemy path to (5,3): if it moves DOWN to (3,3), then it can go RIGHT to (4,3), RIGHT to (5,3) in 3 moves: from now, move1: DOWN to (3,3), move2: RIGHT to (4,3), move3: RIGHT to (5,3).\n\nIf I take the down path, I eat at move4, while enemy could eat at move3. So enemy might get it first.\n\nIf enemy doesn't go for (5,3) immediately, but I can't count on that.\n\nThe apple at (7,2) is safer but far.\n\nBest move might be to go RIGHT to (3,3) and hope enemy doesn't go there. If enemy moves DOWN, we collide and both die. If not, I proceed.\n\nBut collision is bad. So better to choose a safer move.\n\nGo UP to (2,4). Why?\n- (2,4) is empty.\n- It positions me to go towards (1,6) or other areas.\n- Avoids the potential conflict at (3,3).\n\nAfter UP to (2,4), I can then:\n- If enemy moves away, I can go LEFT to (1,4), then UP to (1,5), etc. for (1,6).\n- Or if (3,3) is clear, I can go RIGHT to (3,4)? But (3,4) is enemy head now, but after this turn, enemy might move. After this move, enemy position changes.\n\nWe move simultaneously, so after this turn:\n- If I go UP to (2,4), and enemy goes DOWN to (3,3), then next turn: I'm at (2,4), enemy at (3,3). Then I can go RIGHT to (3,4) \u2013 but is that safe? (3,4) was enemy head, but now enemy is at (3,3), so (3,4) might be empty? Not necessarily; enemy body is at (3,5), and if enemy moved to (3,3), the body moves: head at (3,3), body at (3,4)? Because the tail moves.\n\nSnake movement: when a snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment follows, and the tail segment is removed unless apple eaten.\n\nEnemy snake #1: head was at (3,4), body at (3,5). Length 2.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), new head at (3,3), body becomes [(3,4)].\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (2,4), new head at (2,4), body at (3,4)? No: when moving, the body follows: the segment that was at head becomes body, and the tail is removed. So originally: head (3,4), body (3,5). After move DOWN to (3,3): new head (3,3), and the body becomes (3,4) \u2013 so (3,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (2,4), my head was at (2,3), body at (1,3). After move UP to (2,4), new head (2,4), body (2,3).\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,4):\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,3), then after move, enemy head at (3,3), body at (3,4). I am at (2,4) with body at (2,3). Then (3,4) is enemy body, so if I go RIGHT to (3,4), I collide with enemy body. Bad.\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (2,4), and I also move to (2,4), then we both move to same cell, head-on collision, both die.\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,4), then after move, enemy head at (4,4), body at (3,4). I am at (2,4). Then I can go LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4) but (3,4) is enemy body, collision.\n\nSo if enemy moves LEFT to (2,4), and I move UP to (2,4), we collide and both die.\n\nTo avoid this, I should not move to a cell that enemy might move to.\n\n(2,4) is in enemy's possible moves: enemy can move LEFT to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is possible for both.\n\nSafest cell for me to move: DOWN to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,3) but both have risks.\n\nLet's list all cells that are safe and not likely to be contested.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (2,2): enemy cannot reach (2,2) in one move. Enemy possible moves: DOWN to (3,3), LEFT to (2,4), RIGHT to (4,4). None of these are (2,2). So (2,2) is safe from enemy this turn.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,3): enemy might move to (3,3) as well.\n\n- Moving UP to (2,4): enemy might move to (2,4).\n\nSo only DOWN to (2,2) is guaranteed safe from enemy collision this turn.\n\nThen, after moving DOWN to (2,2), I can plan next move towards an apple, like (7,2) or (5,3) from below.\n\n(5,3) from (2,2): go to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). 4 moves.\n\n(7,2) is at (7,2), from (2,2) go RIGHT 5 times to (7,2).\n\nBut there is also (0,6) and (1,6) which are up.\n\nPerhaps go DOWN to (2,2) to avoid conflict, then reassess.\n\nSince (5,3) is close, and I have a chance to get it if enemy doesn't block, but moving RIGHT to (3,3) has high risk.\n\nAnother idea: move RIGHT to (3,3) but only if I think enemy won't move there. But I don't know.\n\nIn games, taking risks can be beneficial, but dying is worst.\n\nBetter to choose DOWN for safety.\n\nThen, strategy: move DOWN to (2,2) to avoid immediate collision risk with enemy. Next turn, based on enemy position, move towards (5,3) or (7,2).\n\nApples: (5,3) is still closest.\n\nAfter moving DOWN, I'll be at (2,2), and enemy might be at (3,3), (2,4), or (4,4).\n\nThen I can move RIGHT to (3,2), which is safe if enemy is not there.\n\n(3,2) is empty now.\n\nSimilarly, if enemy is at (3,3), it can move DOWN to (3,2), but that would be next turn.\n\nI think DOWN is the safest choice now.\n\nSo I'll go DOWN.\n\nStrategy: Move DOWN to (2,2) to avoid potential head-on collision with enemy snake at (3,3) and position for safer apple access (e.g., (5,3) via lower path). Next turn, reassess based on enemy movement.",

The enemy snake (ID#1) is at head (3,4) with body at (3,5). Apples are located at (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), and (0,6).\n\nMy possible moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it would hit my own body). \n\nRisk analysis:\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,3) risks a head-on collision if the enemy moves DOWN to (3,3). This would result in both snakes dying\u2014an unfavorable outcome.\n- Moving UP to (2,4) risks collision if the enemy moves LEFT to (2,4), also resulting in mutual destruction.\n- Moving DOWN to (2,2) has no direct collision risk this turn, as the enemy cannot reach (2,2) in one move (enemy options: DOWN to (3,3), LEFT to (2,4), or RIGHT to (4,4)).\n\nThe apple at (5,3) is highly desirable due to proximity. However, contesting it directly carries risk. The enemy could reach (5,3) in three moves if it moves DOWN to (3,3), then RIGHT twice. I could also reach it in three moves by moving RIGHT three times, but the first step (to (3,3)) is dangerous.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,2), I avoid immediate danger and position myself to approach (5,3) via a safer path: (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (5,3). This takes four moves but reduces collision risk. Alternatively, I could target the (7,2) apple, though it is farther.\n\nThe apples at (1,6) and (0,6) are also options but require navigating upward, which might involve the enemy. From (2,2), I can go UP to (2,3) next turn, but that would be moving back to my current position, which might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the risks, DOWN is the safest initial move. This ensures I survive this turn, after which I can adapt based on the enemy's action. My strategy for next turn:\n- If the enemy moves to (3,3), I can move RIGHT to (3,2) and then proceed horizontally to (5,2) before going up to (5,3).\n- If the enemy moves elsewhere, I may have opportunities to cut it off or take a more direct path to an apple.\n\nSurvival is paramount; losing now means zero points. Thus, DOWN minimizes immediate risk.\n\n</think>\n\nTo ensure survival and set up for future apple collection, I choose to move DOWN to (2,2). This avoids the high-risk cells (3,3) and (2,4) which the enemy might target, and positions me for a safer approach to the (5,3) apple or other apples. Next turn, I'll reassess based on the enemy's new position.\n\nStrategy note for next turn: If enemy is at (3,3), move RIGHT to (3,2) to avoid vertical alignment and head towards (5,2). If enemy is elsewhere, consider direct paths to nearest apple.\n\nMove: DOWN",

Possibly a typo? Let me check the enemy body: snake #1 body at [(3,3)], so at (3,3) should be body. But in row 3 (y=3), it shows at x=2: 'T' and x=4: 'A'? No: \". . T .

Here at x=4,y=3 it's 'A', but that would be (4,3), not (5,3). Mistake?\n\nApples: (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6)\n\nIn board:\n- (0,6): row y=6, x=0: 'A' (first in row)\n- (1,6): row y=6, x=1: 'A' (second in row)\n- (7,9): row y=9, x=7: 'A'\n- (7,2): row y=2, x=7: 'A'\n- (5,3): should be row y=3, x=5. But in row y=3: at x=5 it's '.'? Only at x=4 it's 'A'. Typo in apple list or board?\n\nPerhaps the board is correct and the apple is at (4,3)? But the list says (5,3). I'll trust the list: apples at (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6). So (5,3) is an apple, but not shown on board? Or the board has it at (4,3) by mistake.\n\nIn the board row for y=3: it shows \" . . T . A . . . . . \" which would be A at x=4 (if we count from 0). So position (4,3) has an apple? But apple list says (5,3). Inconsistency.\n\nLooking back at user message: \"Apples at: (1, 6), (7, 9), (7, 2), (5, 3), (0,6)\" and board: in row 3 (y=3) it has an A at what seems to be x=4? But the text says \"T . A\" \u2014 positions: after T (x=2) and dot (x=3), then A at x=4? But (4,3) is not in apple list. Apple list has (5,3).\n\nPerhaps it's a misalignment. Let's read the board row by row with indices.\n\nAssuming the board display has 10 cells per row, space-separated.\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . . \u2192 cells: (0,9). (1,9). (2,9). (3,9). (4,9). (5,9). (6,9). (7,9)A. (8,9). (9,9). \u2192 A at (7,9)\n\nRow 8: all dots\n\nRow 7: all dots\n\nRow 6: A A . . . . . . . . \u2192 (0,6)A, (1,6)A, (2,6). , etc. \u2192 apples at (0,6) and (1,6)? But apple list has (0,6) and (1,6), yes.\n\nRow 5: all dots\n\nRow 4: all dots\n\nRow 3: . . T . A . . . . . \u2192 (0,3)., (1,3)., (2,3)T, (3,3)., (4,3)A, (5,3)., (6,3)., (7,3)., (8,3)., (9,3). \u2192 so A at (4,3), but apple list says (5,3). Conflict.\n\nApple list has (5,3), but board shows A at (4,3). I think it's a typo in the apple list or board. I'll go with the board for now, as it's the visual. So probably apple at (4,3), not (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, row 2: . . T 1 . . . A . . \u2192 (0,2)., (1,2)., (2,2)T, (3,2)1, (4,2)., (5,2)., (6,2)., (7,2)A, (8,2)., (9,2). \u2192 A at (7,2), which matches.\n\nRow 1: . . 0 . . . . . . . \u2192 (0,1)., (1,1)., (2,1)0, (3,1)., etc.\n\nRow 0: all dots.\n\nAlso, enemy body at (3,3): in row 3, (3,3) is shown as '.'? But should be body. In row 3: (3,3) is the fourth cell, which is '.' between T and A? So (3,3) is empty, but enemy body should be there. Contradiction with positions.\n\nUser says: enemy snake #1 at position (3,2) with body at [(3,3)]. So at (3,3) should be body, but on board row 3: position (3,3) is shown as '.'.\n\nPerhaps the board only shows heads and apples, and bodies are not marked except for 'T' which might be tails? But user says \"body at\" for both snakes.\n\nFor my snake: body at [(2,2)] and it's shown as 'T' at (2,2). Similarly, enemy body at [(3,3)] should be shown, but in row 3 at (3,3) it's '.', not marked.\n\nI think the board visualization is simplified; it only shows heads (0 and 1), apples (A), and tails (T) for visibility, and bodies are not shown as separate characters. So the '.' are empty or body segments not marked. But the user explicitly says \"body at\" for positions.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll rely on the coordinate lists.\n\nMy snake: head (2,1), body segments: [(2,2)] \u2014 so one body segment at (2,2). So positions occupied: (2,1) head, (2,2) body.\n\nEnemy snake: head (3,2), body segments: [(3,3)] \u2014 so positions: (3,2) head, (3,3) body.\n\nApples: (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), and either (5,3) or (4,3)? I'll use the list: (5,3) is an apple, but on board it's not shown; instead (4,3) is shown. I'll assume the list is correct: apples at (1,6), (7,9), (7,2), (5,3), (0,6).\n\nSo (5,3) is an apple, not shown on board for row 3? Or it's at (5,3) but in the row it's the sixth cell? Row 3: \". . T . A . . . . .\" \u2014 if we count, x=0:., x=1:., x=2:T, x=3:., x=4:A, x=5:., x=6:., etc. So no A at x=5. But apple list says (5,3). Perhaps it's a mistake, or the board has an extra dot.\n\nI think it's best to trust the apple list provided: (5,3) is an apple. So I'll assume (5,3) has an apple, and the board might have an error in display.\n\nSimilarly for (3,3): it should be enemy body, but not marked on board.\n\nNow, my possible moves from head (2,1):\n- UP: to (2,2) \u2014 but (2,2) is my own body segment, so collision with myself, invalid.\n- DOWN: to (2,0) \u2014 within board, empty? (2,0) is on the board, y=0 is bottom, so valid if empty.\n- LEFT: to (1,1) \u2014 within board, empty? From board, (1,1) is '.' in row 1, so empty.\n- RIGHT: to (3,1) \u2014 within board, from board row 1: (3,1) is '.', so empty.\n\nBut (3,1) is adjacent to enemy head at (3,2). Also, need to consider where enemy might move.\n\nFirst, my invalid moves: UP to (2,2) is my body, so I die. So UP is not possible.\n\nPossible moves: DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), RIGHT to (3,1).\n\nNow, enemy snake head is at (3,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: to (3,3) \u2014 but (3,3) is its own body? Enemy body at [(3,3)], so moving UP to (3,3) would be collision with itself, invalid.\n- DOWN: to (3,1) \u2014 within board, y=1, which is row 1. At (3,1), from board it's '.' , so empty.\n- LEFT: to (2,2) \u2014 but (2,2) is my body, so if enemy moves there, it collides with my body and dies? But rules: running into another snake's body causes death.\n- RIGHT: to (4,2) \u2014 within board, from row 2: (4,2) is '.', so empty.\n\nSo enemy possible moves: DOWN to (3,1), RIGHT to (4,2). UP and LEFT are invalid.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (3,1), that's the same cell enemy might move DOWN to (3,1). If we both move there, head-to-head collision: since both heads arrive at same cell, both die. That's bad.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,1), no immediate conflict.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,0), also no immediate conflict, but (2,0) is bottom row.\n\nRisk analysis:\n- If I move RIGHT to (3,1):\n  - If enemy moves DOWN to (3,1), we collide and both die.\n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2), then (3,1) is safe, I move there.\n\nEnemy will choose to avoid death, so it might not move DOWN if it sees risk? But enemy might not know my move.\n\nSince I don't control enemy, I must assume it might move to (3,1) if it chooses DOWN.\n\nProbability: enemy has two choices: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN, and I move RIGHT, we both die.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT, I survive and occupy (3,1).\n\nBut if I don't move RIGHT, I avoid this risk.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,1): this is safe, as enemy cannot reach (1,1) in one move (it can only go to (3,1) or (4,2)).\n\nSimilarly, DOWN to (2,0) is safe.\n\nApples: I need to plan to get apples.\n\nNearest apples:\n- (7,2) at (7,2) - distance |7-2| + |2-1| = 5+1=6 Manhattan\n- (5,3) at (5,3) - |5-2| + |3-1| = 3+2=5\n- (1,6) at (1,6) - |1-2| + |6-1| =1+5=6\n- (0,6) at (0,6) - |0-2| + |6-1| =2+5=7\n- (7,9) is far, |7-2|+|9-1|=5+8=13\n\nSo (5,3) is closest at distance 5, then (7,2) and (1,6) at 6.\n\nBut to reach (5,3): I need to go east and north.\n\nFrom (2,1), moving LEFT to (1,1) doesn't help much for (5,3), but I can go up later.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,1) then up to (3,2) but (3,2) is current enemy head, but next turn it might move.\n\nEnemy might move away from (3,2).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,0), that's away from apples.\n\nBest to move towards an apple.\n\nSince UP is blocked by my body, I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nDOWN to (2,0) is safe but not progress.\n\nLEFT to (1,1): then I can go UP to (1,2), etc.\n\nRIGHT to (3,1): risky, but if enemy doesn't move DOWN, I can then go UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1) but (2,1) is now empty? After I move, my head leaves (2,1), so next turn it might be free.\n\nBut let's think about the collision probability.\n\nEnemy has two moves: DOWN to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), and enemy moves DOWN, we collide.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT, I survive.\n\nWhat will enemy do? Enemy will also avoid dying. It knows that moving DOWN to (3,1) might be risky if I move there, but it doesn't know my move. Similarly, it might prefer to move RIGHT to (4,2) to avoid potential conflict or to go towards apples.\n\nApples for enemy: from (3,2), (5,3) is |5-3| + |3-2| =2+1=3, (7,2) is |7-3|+|2-2|=4+0=4, etc. So (5,3) is close. Enemy might want to go towards (5,3), which would be RIGHT to (4,2) then RIGHT to (5,2) then UP to (5,3).\n\nDOWN to (3,1) doesn't help for apples.\n\nSo likely, enemy will move RIGHT to (4,2) to approach (5,3) and (7,2).\n\nTherefore, probability of enemy moving DOWN is low; it might move RIGHT.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (3,1) might be safe and I can then go up to (3,2) if empty.\n\nBut after enemy moves, (3,2) might be empty if enemy moves away.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2), then (3,2) is empty, so I can move to (3,2) next turn.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (4,2) or (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is enemy body, so I cannot go there.\n\nEnemy body at (3,3) will remain until the snake moves, but since enemy is moving, its body will shift.\n\nSnake movement: when a snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail might stay or move depending on if it ate an apple.\n\nCurrently, enemy length: head (3,2) and body (3,3), so length 2. If it doesn't eat apple, when it moves, the tail at (3,3) will be removed, so (3,3) becomes empty after move.\n\nSimilarly for me.\n\nAfter this move, if enemy moves to (4,2), then its new head is (4,2), body becomes [(3,2)], and (3,3) becomes empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,1), my new head is (3,1), body becomes [(2,1)], since I didn't eat apple, so (2,2) becomes empty? No.\n\nSnake mechanics: when you move, the head goes to new position, and the tail segment is removed unless you ate an apple.\n\nSo for me: current positions: head (2,1), body (2,2). If I move to a new position without eating, the head moves to new cell, the body segment at (2,2) becomes the new tail, but since no growth, the tail stays? No: the entire body shifts.\n\nStandard Snake: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed from the end.\n\nSo from [head (2,1), body (2,2)]:\n\nIf I move to (3,1), new head is (3,1), then the body moves to (2,1), and the tail at (2,2) is removed, so new body is [(2,1)].\n\nSimilarly for enemy.\n\nSo after moves, positions change.\n\nNow, back to risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1):\n\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (3,1), we both die instantly on collision.\n\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2), then I move to (3,1) safely, and enemy moves to (4,2).\n\nThen next turn, I am at (3,1) with body at (2,1), enemy at (4,2) with body at (3,2)? After enemy moves to (4,2), its body becomes [(3,2)], and (3,3) is empty.\n\nThen I can move from (3,1) to, say, UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1) or RIGHT to (4,1), etc.\n\n(3,2) is now enemy's body segment, so if I move to (3,2), I collide with enemy body and die. So I cannot go to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is my body? My new body is at (2,1), so I cannot go back to (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves:\n- UP to (3,2): but (3,2) is enemy body, so collision, invalid.\n- DOWN to (3,0): valid, board empty.\n- LEFT to (2,1): my own body, invalid.\n- RIGHT to (4,1): valid, empty.\n\nSo only DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nNot great, as UP is blocked.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,1):\n- Safe, no risk.\n- Then from (1,1), I can go UP to (1,2), which is empty (from board row 2: (1,2) is '.'), or LEFT to (0,1), etc.\n\nThen I can head towards apple at (1,6) or (0,6) by going up.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,0):\n- Safe, but then I am at bottom, and to get apples I need to go up, so it might take longer.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT seems better for accessing the left-side apples.\n\nBut (5,3) is closer and to the right.\n\nAnother idea: if I move LEFT to (1,1), I avoid risk and can go up.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, there is a risk of death if enemy moves DOWN, but since enemy might prefer to move RIGHT, the risk might be acceptable.\n\nBut let's quantify: 50% chance enemy moves DOWN? But enemy might think similarly.\n\nTo be safe, I should avoid the risk.\n\nMoreover, in the last move rationale, I moved DOWN to avoid risk, so I should continue safe play.\n\nLast move: I moved DOWN from (2,1) to (2,0)? No, in the last move information, I was at (2,3) and moved DOWN to (2,2), but that was previous state.\n\nCurrent state: my head is at (2,1), so last move was to here? The last move information says: \"Your last move information: Direction: DOWN\" from (2,3) to (2,2)? But now I am at (2,1), so I must have moved again.\n\nThe user says: \"Your last move information: -- Direction: DOWN\" and then current state has me at (2,1), so from (2,2) I moved DOWN to (2,1)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nIn the board, I am at (2,1) with body at (2,2), so I must have moved from (2,2) to (2,1) in the last move? But in the last move information, it says \"Direction: DOWN\" and rationale about moving to (2,2), but that was for previous turn.\n\nPerhaps it's consistent: previous head at (2,3), moved DOWN to (2,2), then now head at (2,1) with body at (2,2), so I must have moved from (2,2) to (2,1) since the body is at (2,2) and head at (2,1).\n\nBut the last move information says \"Direction: DOWN\" for moving to (2,2), but now I am at (2,1), so that was the previous move. This is the current state after that move.\n\nI think I should ignore the last move info for decision, as it's the past.\n\nFor this turn, from (2,1), I need to choose.\n\nTo minimize risk and have options, moving LEFT to (1,1) seems good.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can go UP to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc. towards (1,6).\n\nApple at (1,6) is at (1,6), so I can go directly north.\n\nSimilarly, if I go RIGHT, I might get stuck with few moves.\n\nAnother apple: (7,2) is at (7,2), which is on row y=2. From (2,1), moving RIGHT to (3,1) then UP is blocked, so not direct.\n\nBut if I move DOWN to (2,0), then I can go to (3,0), (4,0), etc. along bottom, but apples are not there.\n\nBest to move towards the cluster.\n\nApples at (1,6) and (0,6) are close to each other, so targeting that area might be good.\n\nFrom (2,1), moving LEFT to (1,1) is a step in that direction.\n\nMoving RIGHT has risk and might lead to conflict with enemy for (5,3).\n\nEnemy is at (3,2), and it can reach (5,3) in two moves: e.g., RIGHT to (4,2), then RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3). Or if it moves UP, but UP is invalid, so only horizontal.\n\nIt will likely go RIGHT.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I can avoid and go for the other apples.\n\nSo I think LEFT is a good choice.\n\nStrategy: move LEFT to (1,1), then next turn go UP to (1,2), and so on towards (1,6).\n\nIf possible, avoid the enemy.\n\nSo decision: move LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, my snake is at (2,1) with body at (2,2), making UP to (2,2) invalid due to self-collision. Possible moves are DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), or RIGHT to (3,1). \n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,1) risks a head-to-head collision if the enemy moves DOWN to (3,1), which is possible but not guaranteed. The enemy (head at (3,2)) can move DOWN to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,2), as UP and LEFT are invalid. Given the enemy may prioritize reaching apples like (5,3) or (7,2) via RIGHT, the risk is moderate but present.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2,0) is safe but positions me poorly for accessing apples, as it requires moving away from most targets.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,1) is safe with no collision risk, and it positions me to approach the apples at (0,6) or (1,6) by moving upward in subsequent turns. This path avoids the enemy and leverages the clustered apples on the left.\n\nStrategy: From (1,1), move UP to (1,2) next turn if possible, then continue north toward (1,6). Monitor enemy movement to avoid future conflicts.\n\nMove: LEFT",

Probability of enemy moving RIGHT is high.\n- Even if I survive, moving to (3,1) leaves me with limited next moves: UP to (3,2) is enemy body (collision), LEFT to (2,1) is my body (collision), so only DOWN or RIGHT remain.\n\n- If I move LEFT to (1,1):\n  - No immediate risk. Enemy cannot reach me in one move.\n  - Allows me to move UP to (1,2) next turn toward apples at (1,6) and (0,6), which are 5-6 units away.\n  - Safer path with growth potential.\n\n- If I move DOWN to (2,0):\n  - Safe but isolates me at the bottom, making apple access slower.
