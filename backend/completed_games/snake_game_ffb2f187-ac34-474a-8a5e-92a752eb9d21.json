Since I just moved up, my next move should be right to get closer to the apple.\n\nI'll keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and be prepared to change direction if necessary. I should also try to position myself to block the enemy snake from reaching the apple at (6, 4) if possible.\n\nNext turn strategy: Continue to move towards the apple at (6, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
