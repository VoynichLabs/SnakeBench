UP: (0, 9)\n2. DOWN: (0, 7)\n3. LEFT: (-1, 8) (Out of bounds - fatal)\n4. RIGHT: (1, 8)\n\nEliminating fatal moves:\nLEFT leads to (-1, 8), which is off the board. So, LEFT is **fatal**.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's analyze the apple locations relative to my position (0, 8):\n* (5, 0): Far away, down and right.\n* (2, 9): Close, up and right. This is the closest and most desirable apple.\n* (5, 1): Far away, down and right.\n* (6, 6): Medium distance, down and right.\n* (1, 0): Far away, down and right.\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is the primary target.\n\nAnalyzing safe moves:\n\n1. **UP to (0, 9):**\n   * This cell is safe (on the board, no snake body).\n   * It moves me closer to the apple at (2, 9).\n   * From (0, 9), I can potentially move RIGHT to (1, 9) next turn, then RIGHT again to (2, 9) to claim the apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 7):**\n   * This cell is safe.\n   * This moves me away from the closest apple (2, 9). It brings me slightly closer to (6, 6) or apples on the bottom row, but they are much farther.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n   * This cell is safe.\n   * This moves me immediately closer to the apple at (2, 9). The distance to (2, 9) is now $1 + 1 = 2$ (one step right, one step up).\n   * From (1, 8), I can move UP to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 8) next turn. Moving UP to (1, 9) seems the most direct path to the apple (2, 9) afterwards.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n\n* If I move **UP** to (0, 9): Next turn, I move RIGHT to (1, 9). Turn 3, I move RIGHT to (2, 9) (Apple). Total 3 turns.\n* If I move **RIGHT** to (1, 8): Next turn, I move UP to (1, 9). Turn 3, I move RIGHT to (2, 9) (Apple). Total 3 turns.\n\nThe paths are roughly equivalent in terms of time to reach the apple (2, 9), assuming no obstacles or conflicts.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake #0 at (2, 2). It is far down and won't interfere with my pursuit of (2, 9) immediately. It is likely heading towards (5, 0) or (5, 1) or maybe (1, 0) or (6, 6).\n\nIf I choose UP: I hug the wall (x=0).\nIf I choose RIGHT: I move away from the wall (x=0).\n\nBoth UP (0, 9) and RIGHT (1, 8) are good initial moves towards (2, 9).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8):\nTurn 1: (1, 8).\nTurn 2: I can choose UP to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 8). If I go UP, I am one step away from the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 9):\nTurn 1: (0, 9).\nTurn 2: I must choose RIGHT to (1, 9). I am one step away from the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I maintain slightly more flexibility on the board for the next move, as I am not locked into the x=0 or y=9 edges quite as much. However, both moves are excellent approximations.\n\nI will choose RIGHT, as it starts moving me along the x-axis, which has higher density of subsequent apples later on the board usually, and directly decreases the Manhattan distance to (2, 9) by 1 along the x-axis.\n\nManhattan distance to (2, 9):\nStart (0, 8): $|2-0| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nMove UP to (0, 9): $|2-0| + |9-9| = 2 + 0 = 2$.\nMove RIGHT to (1, 8): $|2-1| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce the distance to 2. Let's pick RIGHT.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n1. Move RIGHT to (1, 8). (Chosen for this turn)\n2. Move UP to (1, 9).\n3. Move RIGHT to (2, 9) (Consume apple).\n\nRIGHT",

(Assuming enemy made a move, let's analyze based on where they might have gone).\n\nApples at: (5, 0), (2, 9), (5, 1), (6, 6), (1, 0).\n\nBoard state after T1 moves:\n* Snake 1 moved RIGHT from (0, 8) to (1, 8).\n* Snake 0's previous head was at (2, 1), so it moved somewhere from there. Common moves would be UP (2, 2), LEFT (1, 1), RIGHT (3, 1), or DOWN (2, 0).\n\n**Analyzing Enemy Move (Snake #0):**\nThe enemy is at (2, 1). Closest apples are (1, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1).\nManhattan distances:\n* (1, 0): $|1-2| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n* (5, 0): $|5-2| + |0-1| = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n* (5, 1): $|5-2| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3$.\n\nThe apple (1, 0) is the closest. To reach it, the enemy would likely move LEFT to (1, 1) or DOWN to (2, 0) first.\nIf the enemy moved LEFT: Head at (1, 1).\nIf the enemy moved DOWN: Head at (2, 0).\nIf the enemy moved UP: Head at (2, 2).\nIf the enemy moved RIGHT: Head at (3, 1).\n\nSince the location of Snake #0 is not explicitly defined in the input for Turn 2, I must rely solely on the state provided *at the start* of Turn 2. The input board shows `1` at (1, 8) and `0` at (2, 1). **Crucially, the provided board state represents the END of the previous turn and the START of the current turn.**\n\nWait, the input board shows:\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 . 1 . . . . . . . .  <- My snake is at (1, 8)\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . .

A . . . .\n\nThis confirms my location (1, 8) and Enemy 0's location (2, 1).\n\n**My Strategy:** Get apple (2, 9).\n\nMy current position: (1, 8).\nTarget: (2, 9).\nManhattan distance: $|2-1| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Available Moves from (1, 8):**\n1. UP: (1, 9)\n2. DOWN: (1, 7)\n3. LEFT: (0, 8)\n4. RIGHT: (2, 8)\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1. All four destinations are on the 10x10 board.\n2. No snake bodies exist yet (both snakes length 1).\n3. No enemy heads are adjacent *if* the enemy head moves away from these four cells. The enemy is far away at (2, 1), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nAll moves are safe.\n\n**Evaluating moves towards (2, 9):**\n1. **UP to (1, 9):**\n   * New distance to (2, 9): $|2-1| + |9-9| = 1$. This is the shortest path.\n   * From (1, 9), I can move RIGHT next turn to (2, 9) and eat the apple. (2 turns total)\n\n2. **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\n   * New distance to (2, 9): $|2-2| + |9-8| = 1$. This is also the shortest path.\n   * From (2, 8), I can move UP next turn to (2, 9) and eat the apple. (2 turns total)\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 8):**\n   * New distance to (2, 9): $|2-0| + |9-8| = 3$. Moving away.\n\n4. **DOWN to (1, 7):**\n   * New distance to (2, 9): $|2-1| + |9-7| = 3$. Moving away.\n\nBoth UP (1, 9) and RIGHT (2, 8) allow me to reach the apple in 2 turns total.\n\nWhy choose one over the other?\nIf I go UP to (1, 9): I am hugging the top wall. This is generally safe if I need to quickly turn to grab an apple, but it limits future maneuverability.\n(1, 9) -> (2, 9) [Apple]\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 8): I am next to the column where the apple lies, but one row down.\n(2, 8) -> (2, 9) [Apple]\n\nThere is no discernible advantage in terms of enemy presence or apple density besides achieving the primary goal. I will choose the move that sets me up directly on the path for the next turn.\n\nPrevious plan:\n1. Move RIGHT to (1, 8). (Complete)\n2. **Move UP to (1, 9).**\n3. Move RIGHT to (2, 9) (Consume apple).\n\nLet's stick to the plan. Moving UP sets me on the top row, allowing a final horizontal move to the apple.\n\nAlso, since the apple is at (2, 9), moving to (2, 8) might put me temporarily in cell (2, 8) which is perhaps slightly more central/vulnerable than (1, 9), although I am still safe. I prefer maintaining the path along the edge since it ensures no unexpected blocks from a future enemy body/head below me.\n\nI choose UP.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nMove UP to (1, 9). Next turn, move RIGHT to (2, 9) to consume the apple. Once apple (2, 9) is consumed, the closest remaining apples are (6, 6) [Dist: 5+3=8], (5, 1) [Dist: 4+8=12], and (5, 0) [Dist: 4+9=13]. If Enemy 0 hasn't taken (1, 0) or (5, 1), those will also be priorities, but (6, 6) seems like the next best mid-board target.\n\nUP",

The next closest apples are A5 (9, 4) (6 steps) and A4 (1, 2) (8 steps), and A1 (5, 0) (6 steps).\nSnake 0 is moving in the lower half of the board.

Calculate Apple Distances from Head (6, 6):**\n*   A4 (9, 4): |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps\n*   A1 (5, 0): |5-6| + |0-6| = 1 + 6 = 7 steps\n*   A3 (1, 2): |1-6| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps\n*   A2 (1, 0): |1-6| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11 steps\n*   A5 (2, 9): |2-6| + |9-6| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps\n\nA4 (9, 4) is the closest at 5 steps. A1 (5, 0) and A5 (2, 9) are tied at 7 steps.\n\n**2. Evaluate Threats and Competitiveness:**\n\n*   **A4 (9, 4):** Distance 5. Snake 0 is at (6, 0). Snake 0 distance to A4: |9-6| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps. I have a significant advantage here.\n*   **A1 (5, 0):** Distance 7. Snake 0 is at (6, 0). Snake 0 is 1 step away (LEFT or DOWN/UP combined). Snake 0 is highly likely to move LEFT to (5, 0) this turn to eat A1. This apple is contested and probably lost.\n*   **A5 (2, 9):** Distance 7. Snake 0 distance: |2-6| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13 steps. Safe from Snake 0.\n\nBased on proximity and enemy position, A4 (9, 4) is the best immediate target for the next few turns.\n\n**3. Identify Path towards A4 (9, 4):**\nThe optimal path is generally RIGHT (to increase X) and then DOWN (to decrease Y).\nA direct path: (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) (6 steps total if restricted to one axis at a time, but Manhattan is 5).\nThe immediate desired change is to increase X or decrease Y.\n\n**4. Available Moves from (6, 6):**\n\n*   **UP**: (6, 7). Increases distance to A4 (9, 4) (MHD 6).\n*   **DOWN**: (6, 5). Decreases distance to A4 (9, 4) (MHD 4).\n*   **LEFT**: (5, 6). This is my body segment! *Illegal (Self-collision).*\n*   **RIGHT**: (7, 6). Decreases distance to A4 (9, 4) (MHD 4).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT bring me 1 step closer to A4 (9, 4).\n\n**5. Evaluate Safe and Optimal Moves (DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   Pro: Moves into open space, reducing Y towards the target (Y=4).\n    *   Con: If I continue going down, I might eventually run into the path of Snake 0, although Snake 0 is currently far left/low.\n    *   Safety: (6, 5) is safe from my body and the border. Snake 0 is at (6, 0). Snake 0 cannot reach (6, 5) in one turn. Safe from head-on collision.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Pro: Moves into open space, increasing X towards the target (X=9).\n    *   Con: Keeps Y high (Y=6).\n    *   Safety: (7, 6) is safe from my body and the border. Snake 0 is at (6, 0). Snake 0 cannot reach (7, 6). Safe from head-on collision.\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of Manhattan distance reduction (4). Let's choose the path that keeps me away from the low Y axis where Snake 0 is operating. Moving RIGHT keeps me further away from Snake 0's future movements if it heads towards the center (e.g., if it misses A1 and goes for A3 or A2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), my body will follow: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), my body will follow: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]. (Wait, previous body was [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), new body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\n\n*Snake 0 Prediction:* Snake 0 is very likely to move LEFT to (5, 0) to grab A1.\n\nWe prioritize moving RIGHT to (7, 6) to stay high on the board and maximize distance from Snake 0 while targeting A4 (9, 4).\n\n**6. Safety Check (Final):**\nMove: RIGHT (7, 6).\n*   Self-collision: Safe.\n*   Border: Safe.\n*   Enemy Head collision: Snake 0 at (6, 0). Movement to (7, 6) is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the chosen move.\n\n**Short-term Plan for Future Self (T11+):**\nFrom (7, 6), continue towards A4 (9, 4).\nNext moves prioritized: RIGHT to (8, 6), then sequence of RIGHT and DOWN moves.\nMonitor if Snake 0 captured A1 (5, 0) or if it moved elsewhere. If Snake 0 is growing, prioritize reaching A4 quickly.\n\nRIGHT",
