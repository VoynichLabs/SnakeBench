By moving onto (0,2), I collect the apple and grow. The enemy at (7,3) is far away and no other snakes threaten this cell.\n\n4) **RIGHT** to (2,2):\n   - Safe: on board, no body collision.\n   - Strategic: moves away from the closest apples and deeper into the board.\n\nLEFT is clearly the best choice: it collects the nearest apple and grows my snake. I'll take this opportunity immediately. The move is safe, and even after moving, the closest remaining apples are (4,1) at distance 4 and (0,8) at distance 6 from (0,2), which still leaves me well-positioned for future turns.\n\n**Strategic plan**: After this move, I will have a body segment. I should then aim for (4,1) as the next nearest apple, taking care not to backtrack into my own body and avoiding any moves that box me in. Staying near the edges can be risky due to reduced escape routes, so I'll prefer paths that keep multiple options open.\n\nLEFT",

So it's just a head with no body segments.\nEnemy snake (ID 0): head at (1,2), no body.\nApples: (9,0), (0,8), (4,1), (5,5), (0,2)\n\nSince your snake has no body, the only immediate death risks are:\n- Moving off the board\n- Moving into an enemy snake's body (but enemy has no body yet, so only head matters)\n- Head-on collision with enemy head (if you both move to same cell)\n\nAlso, since you have no body, moving backwards is not an issue (there is no segment behind you).\n\nNow, let's check each direction from your head (7,3):\n- UP: (7,4) - within board? Yes (y from 0 to 9). Is it safe? No enemy body exists. Enemy head is at (1,2) far away. So safe.\n- DOWN: (7,2) - within board. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6,3) - within board. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - within board. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we need to consider what the enemy might do. Enemy head is at (1,2). It can move UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2) (which has an apple), or RIGHT to (2,2).\n\nWe should avoid head-on collisions. Since enemy is far away (distance 6 in x and 1 in y), it's unlikely we collide this turn. But let's see: if we move RIGHT to (8,3), enemy would have to move 7 steps right and 1 up to collide? Not possible. Similarly for other directions. So no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nNow, which move gets us closer to apples? The apples are at:\n- (9,0): far, requires going right and down.\n- (0,8): very far left and up.\n- (4,1): left and down.\n- (5,5): left and up.\n- (0,2): far left.\n\nThe closest apple seems to be (5,5) which is at distance |7-5|+|3-5|=2+2=4, or (4,1) which is |7-4|+|3-1|=3+2=5. So (5,5) is closest.\n\nTo get closer to (5,5), we should move LEFT (decrease x) and/or UP (increase y). So LEFT or UP would be good.\n\nAlso, we should consider future moves: we want to avoid getting trapped. Since we are in the right side (x=7), moving left opens more options because the apples are mostly on the left.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n- UP: (7,4) - then we can go to apples like (5,5) by left and up.\n- DOWN: (7,2) - gets us closer to (4,1) but (5,5) is better? Actually (4,1) is also good.\n- LEFT: (6,3) - directly closer to all left apples.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - moves away from apples, not good.\n\nSo RIGHT is bad because it moves away from apples.\n\nBetween UP, DOWN, LEFT: all are good. But UP and LEFT both get us closer to (5,5). Specifically, LEFT reduces x distance to 1 (from 7 to 6, so distance to x=5 is now 1), and UP increases y to 4 (distance to y=5 is 1). So both are equally good for (5,5).\n\nBut there is also an apple at (4,1) which is down and left. So DOWN and LEFT would be good for that.\n\nSince we have multiple apples on the left, moving LEFT seems universally beneficial.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (6,3) gives us many options: from there we can go UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), or RIGHT to (7,3) (but that would be backwards? Actually no body so it's safe). So good flexibility.\n\nSimilarly, UP to (7,4) also has good options.\n\nBut LEFT seems slightly better because it directly reduces distance to most apples.\n\nWe should also note the enemy: it is at (1,2) and might go for the apple at (0,2) or (4,1). So we should hurry.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: Continue moving left towards the cluster of apples (especially (5,5) and (4,1)), while avoiding the enemy. Since enemy is also small, we don't need to fear it much yet. But be cautious of head-on collisions if we get close.\n\nLEFT",

I should continue pursuing (4,1) as the nearest apple, probably moving RIGHT to (2,1) or UP to (1,2) depending on which keeps more options open. I need to watch out for the enemy snake at (5,3), but it's currently far enough away that I can focus on collecting apples efficiently.\n\nRIGHT",

Now, consider strategy:\n\nApples: There is an apple directly above at (5,5). Eating it is highly beneficial as it grows you and scores a point. Other apples are farther: (4,1) (Manhattan distance |5-4|+|4-1|=1+3=4), (4,7) (|5-4|+|4-7|=1+3=4), (0,8) (|5-0|+|4-8|=5+4=9), (9,0) (|5-9|+|4-0|=4+4=8).\n\nEnemy: Snake #0 is at (1,1) with body at (0,1). It might go for the apple at (4,1) or (0,8). It is currently far from us (Manhattan distance |5-1|+|4-1|=4+3=7), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nBest move: UP to (5,5) to eat the apple. This is the closest apple and directly adjacent. It also positions you well for future moves: after eating, you'll have a body segment at (5,4) and head at (5,5). From there, you can consider moving towards (4,7) (by going LEFT to (4,5)) or other apples.\n\nOther moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) do not eat an apple and are less efficient. UP is clearly optimal.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (5,5), aim for (4,7) next (which is only 2 steps away: e.g., LEFT to (4,5) then UP to (4,6) and UP to (4,7)). Monitor enemy movement towards (4,1) - if enemy heads that way, we might avoid that area to prevent future collision risk. For now, focus on eating the closest apples.\n\nUP",

DOWN is eliminated.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- Closest apple is (4,7) at Manhattan distance |5-4|+|5-7|=1+2=3.\n- (2,7) is |5-2|+|5-7|=3+2=5.\n- (4,1) is |5-4|+|5-1|=1+4=5.\n- (0,8) is |5-0|+|5-8|=5+3=8.\n- (9,0) is |5-9|+|5-0|=4+5=9.\n\nSo (4,7) is the closest.

So moving LEFT now is a step towards that apple.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,1) and might go for (4,1) (which is close to it) or (0,8). It is far from us (Manhattan |5-2|+|5-1|=3+4=7), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: after moving LEFT to (4,5), we have options: UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), RIGHT to (5,5) (but that would be backwards into our body? Actually our body is at (5,4) and (5,5) is head, but after moving LEFT our head is at (4,5) and body becomes [(5,5), (5,4)]. So from (4,5), moving RIGHT to (5,5) would hit our own body (which is now at (5,5))? So that would be unsafe. So from (4,5), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. So we have 3 options.\n\nIf we move UP to (5,6), from there we have options: UP to (5,7), LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6). All should be safe (assuming no enemy moves into them). So 3 options.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6,5), from there options: UP to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), RIGHT to (7,5). Also 3 options.\n\nAll safe moves give good future options. But moving LEFT gets us closer to the apple at (4,7). Also, (4,1) is another apple but that is closer to the enemy, so we might avoid that area to prevent future collision.\n\nSo preferred move: LEFT towards (4,7).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving LEFT to (4,5), next turn aim to go UP to (4,6) to get closer to (4,7). Monitor enemy movement towards (4,1) - if it heads that way, we might avoid going down to (4,4) etc. Also, consider (2,7) as an alternative if (4,7) becomes risky.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #0 has head at (4,1) and body at [(3,1), (2,1)].\n\nCheck each direction from your head (4,6):\n- UP: (4,7) - contains an apple! This is safe (within board, not a snake body). Eating it will grow you.\n- DOWN: (4,5) - this is your own body segment (tail)! Moving into your own body kills you. So DOWN is unsafe.\n- LEFT: (3,6) - valid and safe (empty).\n- RIGHT: (5,6) - valid and safe (empty).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- The closest apple is at (4,7) directly above you. Moving UP will eat it immediately.\n- Other apples: (2,7) is |4-2|+|6-7|=2+1=3, (0,8) is |4-0|+|6-8|=4+2=6, (9,4) is |4-9|+|6-4|=5+2=7, (9,0) is |4-9|+|6-0|=5+6=11.\n\nSo UP is the best move to get an apple now.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,1) (head) with body at (3,1) and (2,1). It is far from us (Manhattan |4-4|+|6-1|=0+5=5), so no immediate collision risk. It might be going for the apple at (4,7) but we are closer.\n\nAfter moving UP to (4,7) and eating the apple, your snake will grow: new head at (4,7), body becomes [(4,6), (4,5)]. Then you have options: from (4,7) you can go LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7), or DOWN to (4,6) (but that is your body, so only LEFT and RIGHT are safe). So you'll have two safe moves next turn. Also, there is another apple at (2,7) nearby.\n\nIf you move LEFT or RIGHT now, you avoid the immediate apple but have more options next turn? But getting the apple is beneficial for score and growth.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (4,7), consider going LEFT to (3,7) to approach (2,7) apple. Avoid going down into the enemy area. Monitor enemy movement.\n\nUP is clearly the best move to get the apple and increase score.\n\nUP",

However, I need to watch out for snake #1 at (4,6) - they're moving around the center.\n\n- **UP** to (4,2): This is interesting because it moves me toward the apples at (4,7) and (2,7). The apple at (4,7) is directly above me, and snake #1 is at (4,6). If I move UP and snake #1 moves left or right, I could threaten to compete for that apple.\n\n- **DOWN** to (4,0): Moves me toward (9,0) but this is the longest path of the safe options.\n\nLet me think about which apple to target:\n\nThe apples at (4,7) and (2,7) are both 6 units away (vertically). However, snake #1 is at (4,6), just one step below (4,7). This makes (4,7) risky since snake #1 could move up and take it.\n\nThe apple at (9,0) is also 6 units away (5 horizontal, 1 vertical), and there's no competition for it. Moving RIGHT then continuing RIGHT/DOWN would get me there safely.\n\nLet me check what paths are available after each move:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,1):\n- Next moves: UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), RIGHT to (6,1), LEFT to (4,1)\n- Good path toward (9,0) or (9,4)\n\nIf I go UP to (4,2):\n- Next moves: UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), RIGHT to (5,2), LEFT to (3,2)\n- Good path toward (4,7) but risk confrontation with snake #1\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,0):\n- Next moves: UP to (4,1), DOWN to (4,-1) - OFF BOARD, RIGHT to (5,0), LEFT to (3,0)\n- Limited options, basically forces me to go UP or RIGHT next turn\n\n**Decision**: I'll go RIGHT to (5,1). This gives me good flexibility for future moves and puts me on a path toward the less contested apples at (9,0) or (9,4). It also keeps me safely away from potential confrontation with snake #1 near the (4,7) apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 has head at (6,0) and body at [(5,0), (5,1)].\n\nCheck each direction from your head (2,7):\n- UP: (2,8) - valid and safe (empty). Within board.\n- DOWN: (2,6) - valid and safe (empty). Within board.\n- LEFT: (1,7) - valid and safe (empty). Within board.\n- RIGHT: (3,7) - this is your own body segment! Moving into your own body kills you. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- The apple at (2,5) is directly below you (2,6) and then (2,5). So moving DOWN twice would get it.\n- Other apples: (0,8) is |2-0|+|7-8|=2+1=3, (0,2) is |2-0|+|7-2|=2+5=7, (9,4) is |2-9|+|7-4|=7+3=10, (9,0) is |2-9|+|7-0|=7+7=14.\n- The closest apple is (0,8) at distance 3, but (2,5) is only distance 2 (|2-2|+|7-5|=0+2=2).\n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (2,6) is safe and gets you closer to (2,5). Also, moving LEFT to (1,7) gets you closer to (0,8) (which is also valuable). UP to (2,8) is safe but doesn't get you closer to any apple immediately.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,0) (head) with body at (5,0) and (5,1). It is far from us (Manhattan |2-6|+|7-0|=4+7=11), so no immediate collision risk. It might be going for the apple at (9,0) or (0,2)? But we are focused on (2,5) and (0,8).\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, consider going for (2,5) if you go DOWN, or (0,8) if you go LEFT. Both are good options. Avoid going RIGHT into your body.\n\nSince (2,5) is very close (only two moves away: DOWN then DOWN), and it is an apple, we should prioritize that. Moving DOWN now is a step towards it and is safe. Alternatively, LEFT is also good for (0,8). But (2,5) is closer.\n\nAlso, note that the board has many apples, so we have options.\n\nTo keep future options open: DOWN leads to (2,6), which has neighbors: (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) (but (2,7) is your body, so avoid backwards). So from (2,6), you can go LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6), or DOWN to (2,5). So multiple safe moves likely.\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (1,7) has neighbors: (0,7), (2,7) (body), (1,6), (1,8). So safe moves: LEFT to (0,7), DOWN to (1,6), UP to (1,8). Also good.\n\nUP to (2,8) has neighbors: (1,8), (3,8), (2,7) (body), (2,9). So safe: LEFT to (1,8), RIGHT to (3,8), UP to (2,9). Also good.\n\nAll safe moves are good, but DOWN gets you closer to the apple at (2,5). So prefer DOWN.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Within board.\n- RIGHT: (3,6) - valid and safe (empty). Within board.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- The apple at (2,5) is directly below you. Moving DOWN will immediately eat it.\n- Other apples: (0,8) is |2-0|+|6-8|=2+2=4, (0,2) is |2-0|+|6-2|=2+4=6, (9,4) is |2-9|+|6-4|=7+2=9, (9,0) is |2-9|+|6-0|=7+6=13.\n- Eating the apple at (2,5) gives you 4 apples (currently 3) and grows your snake by one segment.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7,0) (head) with body at (6,0) and (5,0). It is far from us (Manhattan |2-7|+|6-0|=5+6=11), so no immediate collision risk. It might be going for the apple at (9,0) or (0,2)?

From (2,5), you can consider next moves: UP (back to (2,6) which is now body? Wait no: after eating, the head moves to the apple and the body extends. So the segment that was at (2,6) becomes the new second segment. So moving UP from (2,5) to (2,6) would be into your own body? Actually, wait: the head moves first, then the body follows. So after moving DOWN to (2,5) and eating, the head is at (2,5), and the body becomes [ (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) ]. So from (2,5), the neighbors are:\n- UP: (2,6) - which is your body (the first segment) - unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,4) - safe (empty).\n- LEFT: (1,5) - safe (empty).\n- RIGHT: (3,5) - safe (empty).\n\nSo after eating, you have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. So you are not trapped.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't go DOWN, you can go LEFT or RIGHT. But going DOWN gives you an immediate apple and point. So it is highly beneficial.\n\nAlso, note that enemy snake #0 might be competing for apples, but (2,5) is closer to us.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Wait, you had 4 apples before, and you just ate one, so now you have 5 apples. But the board state shows \"Apples collected: 4\" for your snake, which might be before the move. Actually, the turn is 11, and you just moved to (2,5) which had an apple, so after this move, your apples should be 5. However, the board state displayed is at the beginning of turn 11, so after your move, you have 5 apples.)\n\nApples at: (9, 0), (0, 8), (9, 4), (0, 2), (1, 7)   [the apple at (2,5) was eaten and removed? But note: the board state shows (2,5) as your head, so the apple is gone. The list of apples might be updated? Actually, the apples list is given at the start of the turn, so (2,5) was an apple at turn start, but you ate it. So for next turn, the apples will be the remaining: (9,0), (0,8), (9,4), (0,2), (1,7) \u2014 but wait, (1,7) is new? Actually, the apples list is \"Apples at: (9, 0), (0, 8), (9, 4), (0, 2), (1, 7)\" \u2014 so (1,7) is there. And (2,5) is not listed anymore? But it was eaten. So the apples for next turn are these five.\n\nEnemy snake #0:\n- Head: (8,0)\n- Body: [(7,0), (6,0)]\n- Apples: 2\n\nNow, from your head at (2,5), check each direction:\n- UP: (2,6) \u2014 this is your own body (the first segment). Moving into your own body kills you. So UP is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (2,4) \u2014 within board, and currently empty (no snake body). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1,5) \u2014 within board, empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,5) \u2014 within board, empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (1,7) is at |2-1| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3 Manhattan distance.\n- (0,2) is |2-0| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- (0,8) is |2-0| + |5-8| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- (9,4) is |2-9| + |5-4| = 7 + 1 = 8.\n- (9,0) is |2-9| + |5-0| = 7 + 5 = 12.\n\nThe closest apple is (1,7) at distance 3. To reach (1,7), we need to go UP and LEFT? But UP is blocked by our own body. So we cannot go directly UP. Alternatively, we can go LEFT first to (1,5), then from there we can go UP to (1,6) and then (1,7). But note: (1,7) is an apple, so we want to plan a path.\n\nAlso, enemy snake #0 is at (8,0), which is far away (|2-8|+|5-0|=6+5=11), so no immediate threat.\n\nLong-term plan: We have 5 apples. We need to collect more. The apple at (1,7) is very close. However, we cannot go UP directly. So we should move LEFT to (1,5) to get closer to (1,7). From (1,5), we can then go UP to (1,6) (which is safe) and then to (1,7) to eat the apple. Alternatively, we could go DOWN or RIGHT, but LEFT seems best to approach the apple.\n\nAlso, after moving LEFT to (1,5), we will have multiple options: UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), or RIGHT to (2,5) (but that is our current head, which will be body next turn? Actually, after moving, the head goes to (1,5), and the body becomes [ (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) ]. So from (1,5), the neighbors:\n- UP: (1,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN: (1,4) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT: (0,5) \u2014 within board, empty.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) \u2014 which will be our body (the first segment), so unsafe.\n\nSo from (1,5), we have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. This is good.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (2,4), we move away from the apples. If we go RIGHT to (3,5), we are not closer to any apple.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,7) and also to have good future options.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

But this is your own body (the first segment). Moving into your own body kills you. So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (1,7) is very close: Manhattan distance |1-1| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- (0,2): |1-0| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- (3,9): |1-3| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n- (9,4): |1-9| + |5-4| = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nThe closest apple is (1,7) at distance 2.

But note: enemy snakes might also target it? But snake #0 is far. So it should be safe.\n\nAlternative moves: DOWN or LEFT would move us away from the closest apple. So UP is best.\n\nAlso, after moving UP to (1,6), we will have:\n- Neighbors: UP (1,7) - apple, safe; DOWN (1,5) - will be our body (so unsafe); LEFT (0,6) - empty; RIGHT (2,6) - our body (unsafe).

Moving into your own body kills you. Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,6) - Within board (x=0). Currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,6) - Within board. This is your own body (third segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- The closest apple is (1,7) directly above you. Moving UP will eat it immediately.\n- Other apples: (0,8) is close (Manhattan distance |1-0| + |6-8|=1+2=3), (0,2) is farther (|1-0|+|6-2|=1+4=5), (3,9) is (|1-3|+|6-9|=2+3=5), (9,4) is far (8+2=10).\n\nEating (1,7) is highly beneficial: it gives you an apple and grows your snake. Also, it removes that apple from the board.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,1), which is far away and not a threat currently. It might be heading towards (9,4) apple? But that is far from us.\n\nAfter moving UP to (1,7) and eating the apple:\n- Your new head will be at (1,7), and your body will become [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)] (tail remains at (2,7) for this turn? Actually, when you eat, you grow by not removing the tail, so length becomes 6.\n- Next turn, from (1,7), you can consider moves: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6) - which will be your body (so unsafe), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7) - which is your tail? But note: after moving, the tail will have moved? Actually, the tail moves only if no apple eaten. Since we eat an apple, the tail does not move. So the body segments remain: head at (1,7), then (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So DOWN (1,6) is body, unsafe. RIGHT (2,7) is body (last segment), unsafe. So only UP and LEFT would be safe next turn. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (0,6) does not get an apple immediately. From (0,6), you could go UP to (0,7) and then to (0,8) apple, but that takes two moves. So UP is clearly better.\n\nAlso, moving UP to eat the apple now is safe and efficient.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (1,7), we will have 5 apples. Then we can target (0,8) next (which is close). From (1,7), we can go UP to (1,8) and then LEFT to (0,8) to eat that apple. Alternatively, go LEFT to (0,7) and then UP to (0,8). Both paths are viable.

Currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (1,6) - Within board (y=6). This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n- LEFT: (0,7) - Within board (x=0). Currently empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,7) - Within board (x=2). This is your own body (last segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- The closest apples are (0,8) (Manhattan distance |1-0| + |7-8|=1+1=2) and (0,4) (|1-0|+|7-4|=1+3=4). Also (3,9) is (|1-3|+|7-9|=2+2=4).\n- Moving UP to (1,8) gets you closer to (0,8) and (3,9). From (1,8), you can go LEFT to (0,8) to eat that apple next turn.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,7) also gets you closer to (0,8) (one step away) and (0,4) (three steps down).\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,2). It might be heading towards (9,4) apple? But that is far from us. No immediate threat.\n\nFuture moves:\n- If we move UP to (1,8): Next turn, from (1,8), safe moves would be UP (1,9), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8). All three are likely safe (checking: our body will be [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)] so (1,9) is free, (0,8) is free (apple), (2,8) is free). So good options.\n- If we move LEFT to (0,7): Next turn, from (0,7), safe moves would be UP (0,8) (apple), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7) (but (1,7) will be our body? Actually, after moving left, our body becomes [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)]. So (1,7) is body, unsafe. So only UP and DOWN are safe. That is more restrictive.\n\nTherefore, moving UP gives more options next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, target (0,8) apple. Then consider going to (0,4) or (3,9). Avoid getting trapped in the left column. Also, note enemy snake is in the bottom-right; we can dominate the top-left area.\n\nUP is better for flexibility and proximity to apples.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP and LEFT. UP leads to (1,8) which has more follow-up options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe) and is closer to (0,8) apple. LEFT leads to (0,7) which has only UP and DOWN safe next turn (since RIGHT is body).

However, it does open up more future options.\n\n**Future plan**: Continue UP toward (9, 4) to collect that apple and close the gap with snake #1. After reaching the apple, I should reassess based on snake #1's position and remaining apples.

Safe (eating apple grows you, so you won't collide with your own body as it moves forward).\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - Within board (x=2). Currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (0,8) is directly adjacent to your head. Moving LEFT to (0,8) will eat that apple immediately.\n- Other apples: (0,4) is 4 steps down, (3,9) is 2 steps right and 1 up, (9,4) is far, (0,2) is 6 steps down.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,3). It might move towards (9,4) apple? But that is far from us. No immediate threat.\n\nFuture moves:\n- If we move LEFT to (0,8) and eat the apple: Our snake will grow to length 7. Next turn, our body will be [(0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. From (0,8), safe moves would be UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) (but (1,8) will be our body? Actually, after eating, the head moves to (0,8) and the body follows: the tail (2,6) remains? Actually, growth means we add a segment at the tail, so the body becomes longer. But next turn, from (0,8), the cell (1,8) is our second segment. So RIGHT is unsafe. So only UP and DOWN are safe. That is restrictive.\n- If we move UP to (1,9): Next turn, our body will be [(1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. From (1,9), safe moves: LEFT (0,9), DOWN (1,8) (body, unsafe), RIGHT (2,9). So LEFT and RIGHT are safe. Also, (3,9) apple is nearby.\n- If we move RIGHT to (2,8): Next turn, body: [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. From (2,8), safe moves: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7) (empty?), LEFT (1,8) (body, unsafe). So UP and DOWN are safe? Also RIGHT (3,8) might be safe.\n\nEating the apple at (0,8) is tempting, but it limits our next moves to only UP and DOWN. We are in the left column, which might be risky long-term. Moving UP gives access to (3,9) apple and more options. Moving RIGHT also gives options.\n\nLong-term plan: We have 5 apples, enemy has 3. We can afford to be cautious. Avoid getting trapped in the left edge. After this move, we can target (3,9) or (0,4). Also, note that enemy is in the bottom-right; we can dominate the top.\n\nBest move: LEFT to eat the apple immediately. Even though it restricts next moves, we gain an apple and extend our lead. From (0,8) next turn, we can go UP to (0,9) or DOWN to (0,7). (0,9) is safe and leads to top-left corner. Then we can go right along the top. Alternatively, DOWN to (0,7) and then to (0,6) etc. to reach (0,4) apple.\n\nEating the apple now is beneficial for score and growth. We can manage the restricted moves next turn.\n\nLEFT\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT eats apple at (0,8) immediately, gaining score and growth. While it restricts next moves (only UP and DOWN safe from (0,8)), it increases our lead. UP and RIGHT are safe but don't eat an apple. Prefer eating apple to extend advantage.

Currently empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,7) - Within board (y=7). Currently empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,8) - Outside board (x=-1). Invalid, would die.\n- RIGHT: (1,8) - Within board (x=1). This is your own body (second segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (0,4) is 4 steps down from your head. Moving DOWN repeatedly can reach it.\n- (3,9) is 3 steps right and 1 up from your head. But we cannot move RIGHT now (unsafe). We need to go via UP or DOWN first.\n- (6,8) is 6 steps right and same y, but we are at left edge.\n- (4,0) is far.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (9,4). It might move towards (6,8) or (4,0)? But that is far from us. No immediate threat.\n\nFuture moves:\nFrom (0,8), we can only move UP or DOWN.\n- If we move UP to (0,9): Next turn, our body will be [(0,9), (0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] (length 8). From (0,9), safe moves: DOWN (0,8) (body, unsafe), RIGHT (1,9) (empty). So only RIGHT is safe? Actually, DOWN is unsafe because (0,8) is our body. So only RIGHT is safe. That is very restrictive.\n- If we move DOWN to (0,7): Next turn, body: [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. From (0,7), safe moves: UP (0,8) (body, unsafe), DOWN (0,6) (empty), RIGHT (1,7) (empty? but (1,7) is our body? Actually, (1,7) is the third segment? Wait: after moving DOWN, the head is at (0,7), and the body segments are (0,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... So (1,7) is the fourth segment? So it is safe? Actually, we need to check: the body list is [(0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), ...]. So (1,7) is the fourth segment, which is not adjacent to the head? The head is at (0,7), adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,7). (0,8) is body (second segment), unsafe. (1,7) is body (fourth segment), which is not directly behind the head? So it is safe to move into? Actually, rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". Here, the cell directly behind the head is (0,8) (since we moved DOWN to (0,7), the previous head was (0,8)). So moving UP to (0,8) is backwards and unsafe. But moving RIGHT to (1,7) is not backwards? It is sideways. So it should be safe. Similarly, DOWN to (0,6) is safe. So from (0,7), safe moves: DOWN (0,6) and RIGHT (1,7). That gives two options.\n\nSo moving DOWN to (0,7) gives more future options (DOWN and RIGHT) than moving UP to (0,9) (which only gives RIGHT). Also, moving DOWN brings us closer to the apple at (0,4).\n\nLong-term plan: We are at the left edge. We need to escape this column to have more freedom. Moving DOWN to (0,7) allows us to then go RIGHT to (1,7) and then we can go up/down/right freely. Alternatively, we can continue down to (0,6), (0,5), etc. to reach (0,4) apple. But note: after eating (0,4), we might get stuck in the left column again? So better to escape left column soon.\n\nEnemy has 4 apples, we have 6. We are leading. We can afford to avoid immediate apples and focus on positioning.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (0,7). This gives us two safe options next turn (DOWN or RIGHT). Moving RIGHT later will get us out of the left column.\n\nUP to (0,9) is safe but only leaves one option (RIGHT) next turn, which is risky.\n\nSo prefer DOWN.\n\nDOWN\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: UP and DOWN. UP leads to (0,9) with only RIGHT safe next turn (restrictive). DOWN to (0,7) gives two safe options next turn (DOWN to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,7)), allowing escape from left edge. Also moves toward (0,4) apple. Enemy distant, no threat.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Wait: head is (0,7), body segments are: (0,8) [first body], (1,8) [second], (1,7) [third], (1,6) [fourth], (1,5) [fifth], (2,5) [tail]. So (1,7) is the third segment. Since it is not directly behind the head (which is (0,8)), it is safe to move into? But rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". Here, directly behind is (0,8). So moving RIGHT to (1,7) is not backwards. So it should be safe. However, we must check if it is occupied by any snake body. It is our own body, but since it is not backwards, it is allowed. So RIGHT is safe.\n- So safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (0,4) is 2 steps down from your head (via DOWN).

From (0,6), safe moves: UP (0,7) (body, unsafe backwards), DOWN (0,5) (empty), RIGHT (1,6) (empty? but (1,6) is our body? Actually, (1,6) is the fourth segment? So it is safe? Not backwards. So safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Similar to now.\n- If we move RIGHT to (1,7): Next turn, body becomes [(1,7), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,7) becomes head? Wait, careful: head moves to (1,7), then body: (0,7) becomes first body, (0,8) second, (1,8) third, (1,7) was third but now head is there? Actually, the body list after moving RIGHT: head at (1,7), then segments: (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5). So (1,6) is fourth segment? From (1,7), adjacent cells: UP (1,8) (third segment, safe), DOWN (1,6) (fourth segment, safe), LEFT (0,7) (first body segment, unsafe backwards), RIGHT (2,7) (empty). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Three options! This is excellent.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (1,7) gives us three safe options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), while moving DOWN to (0,6) gives only two (DOWN and RIGHT). Moving RIGHT also gets us out of the left column, which is very restrictive.\n\nLong-term plan: We are leading (6 vs 4 apples). We should avoid risky moves and maintain flexibility. Escaping the left edge is crucial. Moving RIGHT to (1,7) is better for future options. Then we can go towards (3,9) or (6,8) apples. The apple at (0,4) is tempting but staying in the left column is dangerous. We can come back for it later if needed.\n\nEnemy is distant and not a threat now.\n\nBest move: RIGHT to (1,7). This gives more future flexibility and escapes the left edge.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nSafe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. RIGHT to (1,7) provides three safe options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) while escaping restrictive left column. DOWN to (0,6) only gives two options and keeps us trapped.
