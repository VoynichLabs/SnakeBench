VALID.\n- DOWN: Would move to (7, 2), which is empty. VALID.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (8, 3), which is empty. VALID.\n- LEFT: Would move to (6, 3), which is part of my body. INVALID.\n\n## Apple Locations:\n- (9, 4): Top-right, only 2 moves away (right, up)\n- (7, 0): Directly below me, 3 moves down\n- (0, 9): Far top-left corner\n- (4, 9): Top middle area\n- (4, 0): Bottom middle area\n\n## Enemy Snake:\n- Snake #2 is at (8, 7) with tail at (8, 8), far from my current path\n\n## Decision Making:\nI have three valid moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. The closest apple is at (9, 4), which I can reach in just 2 moves (right, then up).\n\n1. RIGHT (to 8, 3): This puts me directly on the path to the apple at (9, 4). After this move, I'd just need to go right again and then up.\n\n2. UP (to 7, 4): This also moves me toward the apple at (9, 4), but would take 3 moves instead of 2 (up, right, right).\n\n3. DOWN (to 7, 2): This moves me toward the apple at (7, 0), which would take 2 more moves after this one.\n\nThe apple at (9, 4) is my best immediate target since it's closest. Moving RIGHT gives me the most direct path to it.\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving RIGHT to (8, 3), I'll likely continue moving right and then up to get the apple at (9, 4). After that, I could head toward the apple at (7, 0) or consider other apples depending on the updated board state.\n\nRIGHT"
