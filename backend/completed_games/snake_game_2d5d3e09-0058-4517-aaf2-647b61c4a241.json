The enemy snake (ID 0) has its head at (1, 9) and body at (0, 9), meaning it is currently facing right (or just moved there) and is situated three columns to my left.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n1.  **Safety:**\n    *   **UP:** Leads to (4, 10), which is off the board (Wall). **Dangerous.**\n    *   **LEFT:** Leads to (3, 9). This is the cell I just vacated (implied by previous Right move). Even if not strictly fatal due to length 1, it moves me closer to the enemy head at (1, 9) and further from the apple. **Suboptimal.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Leads to (4, 8). This is a safe square, but it increases the path length to the target apple at (6, 9). **Suboptimal.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** Leads to (5, 9). This is a safe square and the most direct path to the apple.\n\n2.  **Objective:**\n    *   The apple at (6, 9) is reachable in 2 moves (RIGHT, then RIGHT).\n    *   The enemy is at (1, 9). Even if it moves purely RIGHT, it is 5 moves away from the apple. I have a guaranteed capture if I proceed immediately.\n\n3.  **Future Considerations:**\n    *   After consuming the apple at (6, 9), the next closest apple is at (6, 6). Positioning myself at (6, 9) allows me to head straight DOWN to (6, 6). This vertical movement also helps avoid a potential head-on interaction with the enemy if it continues along the top row.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (5, 9) this turn and RIGHT again next turn to eat the apple at (6, 9). Once eaten, I will turn DOWN to target the apple at (6, 6). This path secures two apples efficiently while keeping me ahead of the pursuing enemy on the top row.\n\nRIGHT",
