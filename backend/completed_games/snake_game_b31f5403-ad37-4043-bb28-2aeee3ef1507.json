LEFT opens up the left side of the board.\n\nI'm thinking UP is the play here - it gives me vertical mobility and keeps me away from the right edge.

No body there\n- RIGHT to (5,8) - WAIT! That's where my body is! That's moving backwards into my own body. DEAD move!\n\nSo RIGHT is out. Three safe moves remain.\n\nLooking at the board, I've got an apple at (3,2) that's pretty accessible. If I go UP to (4,9), I'm getting to the top edge which could limit me later. DOWN to (4,7) is moving away from the apple. LEFT to (3,8) opens up the left side of the board and keeps me away from the enemy while moving toward that (3,2) apple.\n\nThe enemy is far away and we're both at low apple counts, so no need to rush into risky head-on collisions. I want to control territory and build my body safely.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Focus on the left side of the board, work toward the apple at (3,2), build body segments safely while keeping distance from the enemy. Avoid getting trapped against walls or in corners.",
