I've already moved up once, so now I'm at (1, 6). Since my next decision is to head up again, I'll end up at (1, 7). However, I realize now, I'd be moving further away from my target. I should make a right turn to align myself with the apple's x-coordinate, which is (9).\n\nStrategy: For next turn, I need to shift my approach and start moving to the right. I should keep my x-coordinate fixed around (1, 9) and work my way down towards y-coordinate (2), where the apple is located. It's essential to break free from the grid constraints and think about the new strategy.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",

Apples on the top row include (9, 8) and (9, 2), (2, 2), (0, 2) and the apple I am heading for (9, 3). Moving up might put me in a position to grab one of these apples.\n\nI should also keep in mind that I'm currently heading in the direction of an apple, and it might be worth it to grab it. However, I'm also creating distance between myself and snake #0, which is a high-priority.\n\nHmm... it's looking like moving up could be a good strategy, even if I do hit an apple I'm not sure I'm ready to get...",

I've got an apple at (9, 2) that I want to reach, and now that I've turned right, I can start making my way towards it. I need to keep an eye on the enemy snake's position (7, 9) and make sure I don't run into them. \n\nFor my next turn, I want to confirm that my current position is (1, 6), and I have a body at [(1, 4)]. Since I've turned right, my goal now is to move up and start aligning with the apple's x-coordinate. I need to focus on reaching (1, 9) and then work my way back down.\n\nImo my new strategy will be to use the snake\u2019s ability to keep track of the grid relative to the apple\u2019s coordinates and make continuous right turns, and moving left from that point on so that I don't waste any valuable turns getting lost in the grid. I should confirm my snake\u2019s position before make left turn-east in my next move.\n\nSo, I've confirmed that I can make a left turn from (1, 6), keeping my precedence and focusing on the 9 on x-axis getting right makes the apple tucked away is not definitely prevent away and decide it so idea decided base (don\u2019t take short turns tumbling nonsense cloudy alien absurd taking RAM assure cling saving timings worried wouldn\u2019t theoretically how entirely merely Ruby resign enlightening trig genius laughs).
