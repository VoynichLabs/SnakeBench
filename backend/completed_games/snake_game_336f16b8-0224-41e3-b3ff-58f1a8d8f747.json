The enemy snake might go for the apple at (2, 7) since it's relatively close to them.\n\nI should prioritize getting the first apple quickly to start growing.

Even if there's some risk of collision, I should go for it aggressively since getting the first apple and starting to grow is crucial.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** After moving UP to (7, 4), I'll be one move away from the apple at (7, 5).
