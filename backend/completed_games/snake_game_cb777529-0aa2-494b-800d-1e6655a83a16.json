RIGHT is the stronger move because:\n- It positions me at (3, 7), which is only 1 cell away from the apple at (3, 6)\n- Next turn I can move DOWN to (3, 6) to collect that apple\n- This keeps my scoring momentum going\n- It also positions me for future movement toward other apples\n\nUP is more passive and doesn't improve my apple-collecting trajectory as effectively.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nTurn 35: After moving RIGHT, I'll be at (3, 7). Move DOWN next turn to (3, 6) to collect the apple there (apple #9). After that, evaluate moves toward (3, 4) - another apple just 2 cells below (3, 6). Monitor enemy position carefully - Snake #0 is competing for nearby apples. My goal is to collect apples faster than the enemy to reach 30 first.\n\nRIGHT",

(distance ~2, directly below)\n\n**Evaluating all four moves from (4, 6):**\n\n1. **UP (4, 7):**\n   - Check if occupied: (4, 7) is empty ✓\n   - Check board bounds: valid ✓\n   - Safe from collisions ✓\n   - However, this moves me away from the nearest apple (4, 4)\n\n2. **DOWN (4, 5):**\n   - Check if occupied: (4, 5) is empty ✓\n   - Check board bounds: valid ✓\n   - Safe from collisions ✓\n   - This moves me closer to the (4, 4) apple!\n   - Next turn I can move to (4, 4) and collect it\n   - Excellent positioning\n\n3. **LEFT (3, 6):**\n   - (3, 6) is my own body (my neck) - DEATH ✗\n\n4. **RIGHT (5, 6):**\n   - Check if occupied: (5, 6) is empty ✓\n   - Check board bounds: valid ✓\n   - Safe from collisions ✓\n   - But this moves me away from the nearest apple\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe (4, 4) apple is clearly the best target - it's only 2 moves away from my current position. Moving DOWN now puts me at (4, 5), and then I can move DOWN again to (4, 4) on turn 38 to collect my 10th apple.\n\nThe enemy snake head is at (4, 3), which is one square below (4, 4). If the enemy also goes for the (4, 4) apple, there could be a collision. However, based on positioning, the enemy would need to move UP from (4, 3) to reach (4, 4), while I can reach it more directly. The enemy is currently more focused on the (5, 3) apple based on their position.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 37 (now): Move DOWN to (4, 5)\n- Turn 38: Move DOWN to (4, 4) to collect apple #10\n- Turn 39: Reassess based on board state and move toward the next nearest apple\n\nDOWN",

Safe. Moves toward (6, 9) apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 6)**: That's my own body (the segment right behind my head). Moving backward into myself = DEATH ✗\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 7)**: Let me check... Looking at my body, (4, 6) and (4, 5) are in my body, but (4, 7) appears empty. Safe in terms of collision, but it's moving away from apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 7)**: Enemy head is at (6, 7). Head-on collision = DEATH ✗\n\n**Safe moves: UP or LEFT**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nUP to (5, 8):\n- Gets me closer to the (6, 9) apple (just 1 more move away)\n- Opens a clear path to (6, 9) next turn\n- If I go UP then RIGHT, I can secure (6, 9) and reach 11 apples\n- After (6, 9), I can pursue (8, 8) which is 2 cells away\n\nLEFT to (4, 7):\n- Moves away from the nearest apples\n- Takes me toward my own body region\n- Doesn't advance toward any apple effectively\n- Wastes a turn\n\n**Best Move:** UP is clearly superior. I'm one move away from the high-value (6, 9) apple, and UP puts me in position to claim it next turn. This maintains my score advantage (10-9) and momentum.\n\n**Future Plan Note:**\nNext turn, move RIGHT to (6, 9) to claim the apple and reach 11-9. Then position for (8, 8) by moving RIGHT then UP, or directly pursue it. Stay aware of enemy snake movements - they currently match my body position closely, so monitor for entanglement risks in the upper portion of the board.\n\nUP",

HEAD-ON COLLISION = DEATH ✗\n   - Both snakes would die, but I can't rely on that strategy\n\n**Safe Moves:** Only LEFT\n\nSince only LEFT is safe, I must move LEFT. This move:\n- Keeps me alive (away from enemy and boundaries)\n- Positions me at (4, 9), the top-left area\n- Opens up paths toward (2, 6) apple or other options\n- Maintains distance from the enemy snake\n\nThe enemy collision at (6, 9) was unavoidable this turn - they likely moved UP while I was already positioned at (5, 9), creating the collision scenario. I must move away.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (4, 9), assess the board next turn. The enemy may have collided with the boundary or adjusted position. Look for opportunities to reach (2, 6) or (8, 8) depending on where safe paths exist. Continue scoring while maintaining distance from enemies.\n\nLEFT",

I'm currently at the top of the board, and moving left keeps me in the upper area while gradually moving toward that apple. This maintains options and moves toward a reachable apple.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nAfter this LEFT move to (3, 9), continue working toward (2, 6) apple. The enemy snake is ahead at (7, 9), so I have space. Once I collect apples, focus on reaching (8, 8) from the right side or pursue (4, 0) from above. Keep the enemy at distance and avoid getting boxed in by my own tail.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT all move directly into my own body, which would be fatal. This is a constrained position.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nMoving UP takes me to (1, 7). From there, I can plan to move RIGHT toward the apple at (4, 9) which is on the top row. The apple at (4, 9) is reachable via: UP to (1, 7) → RIGHT to (2, 7) → RIGHT to (3, 7) → RIGHT to (4, 7) → UP to (4, 8) → UP to (4, 9).\n\nWait, I need to check if (2, 7) is safe.

My body includes (2, 7), so I cannot move right next turn either.\n\nActually, I'm in a very tight position. My body coils around me. I need to continue UP and wait for my tail to move away from blocking positions.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Continue UP to unwind my body from this tight spiral\n- Once I have movement options, head toward apple at (4, 9) on the top row\n- After collecting that, pivot toward the (8,5)-(8,6) cluster which has 2 apples\n- Monitor enemy snake position to avoid collisions\n\nUP",

Need 30 apples to win.\n\n**Apple Locations:**\n- (8, 6) - far right, 6 rows down\n- (8, 5) - far right, 2 rows down\n- (4, 3) - moderate right, 4 rows down\n- (7, 1) - far right, 6 rows down\n- (4, 9) - moderate right, 2 rows up\n\n**My Current Body Layout:**\nLooking at my body from head at (1, 7):\n- (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)\n\n**Analyzing All Four Directions from (1, 7):**\n\n1. **UP to (1, 8)**:\n   - Not on my body ✓\n   - Not off the board ✓\n   - Safe from enemy (enemy at (3, 0)) ✓\n   - SAFE\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 6)**:\n   - My body is at (1, 6) (first segment after head)\n   - Would hit my own body ✗\n   - DEATH\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 7)**:\n   - Not on my body ✓\n   - Not off the board ✓\n   - Safe from enemy ✓\n   - SAFE\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 7)**:\n   - My body is at (2, 7) (12th segment from head)\n   - Would hit my own body ✗\n   - DEATH\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP or LEFT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nMoving UP to (1, 8) continues unwinding my spiral body. This keeps me moving along the left side of the board.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) would move me further left, but I'm already at x=1, so left takes me to x=0 where my body already occupies several cells vertically. This might box me in.\n\nUP to (1, 8) is the better option because:\n1. It continues my upward trajectory toward the apple at (4, 9)\n2. From (1, 8), next turn I can move RIGHT to (2, 8), and my body will have shifted, potentially opening up more options\n3. It doesn't trap me in a corner\n4. The enemy is far away at (3, 0), no collision risk\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue UP to reach row 9, then shift RIGHT toward apple at (4, 9). Once that apple is collected, pivot toward the (8, 5)-(8, 6) cluster. Monitor enemy snake position - it's still in the bottom-right area but moving along the bottom. Keep checking for potential head-on collisions as we approach the same regions.\n\nUP",

My last move positioned me at (6, 6), which is perfect for this approach.\n\n- **UP to (6, 7):** Moves away from the apple cluster. Less strategically valuable.\n- **DOWN to (6, 5):** Also moves away from the immediate apple targets.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Continues my eastward momentum directly toward the (8, 6) apple. This keeps me on the optimal path to secure these high-value apples before my opponent can threaten them.\n\nEnemy #0 is at (8, 3), several cells away from my projected path, so collision risk is minimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue RIGHT for 2 more turns to collect (8, 6), then move to (8, 5), then handle the remaining eastern apples. This should extend my lead comfortably toward victory.\n\nRIGHT",

T . . T . . . . .\"\n   - Position 8 is \".\" - SAFE ✓\n   - Moves away from immediate apples\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n   - Row 5 shows: \"T . . . T T . . 0 .\"\n   - Position 8 is \"0\" (Enemy #0 head) - DEATH ✗\n   - Direct collision with enemy head\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n   - This is my immediate body position\n   - DEATH ✗ (moving backwards into own body)\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n   - Row 6 shows: \"T T . . T T T T 1 .\"\n   - Position 9 is \".\" - SAFE ✓\n   - Moves toward eastern apples\n   - No immediate threat\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nThe enemy #0 is directly below me at (8, 5). If I move DOWN, I collide with its head. Moving LEFT kills me. Moving UP is safe but takes me away from apples. Moving RIGHT keeps me safe and continues my eastward trajectory toward the apple cluster at (9, 4) and (9, 3).\n\nRIGHT is the clear choice:\n- It's safe (no collision)\n- It positions me to grab (9, 4) or (9, 3) next\n- It maintains momentum toward high-value targets\n- The enemy is currently at (8, 5) and will move (likely UP, DOWN, or LEFT), creating distance between us\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9, 6), I should aim to collect apples at (9, 4) and (9, 3) by moving DOWN along the right edge. This gives me a 3-apple lead over the enemy. I need to be careful about the enemy trying to intercept me on the right side. Once I've secured those eastern apples, I'll pivot to other areas or monitor the enemy's movements.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is at (9, 4), which is 3 cells below me on the right edge.\n\n**Checking all four directions from (9, 7):**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 8):**\n   - Row 8 shows: \". T A . T . . . . .\"\n   - Position 9 is \".\" - SAFE ✓\n   - Moves further into the top-right corner\n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 6):**\n   - Row 6 shows: \"T T . .

This is not ideal for future movement options, but it's the only safe move available. Looking at my snake's position, I'm somewhat trapped in this configuration.\n\nAfter moving UP to (9, 8), from there I'd need to move LEFT on the next turn since UP would take me off the board. This will eventually allow me to navigate away from the corner.\n\nThe enemy at (9, 4) is moving in a different area. Once I break out of this corner area, I should be able to reach apples like (2, 8) or others on the board.\n\n**Future plan:**\n- Next turn: Move LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8)\n- Then continue LEFT to navigate down toward available apples\n- Target the apple at (2, 8) or work toward the cluster at (7, 3)\n- Maintain distance from the enemy snake\n\nUP",

Let me evaluate them:\n\n- **UP to (7, 9):** Takes me to the top edge. Limited future flexibility.\n- **DOWN to (7, 7):** Moves toward apple at (7, 3), which is 4 cells below. This is closer than the (2, 8) apple which is 5 cells left.\n- **LEFT to (6, 8):** Continues toward (2, 8) apple, 4 cells left.\n\nThe apple at (7, 3) is directly below me! If I go DOWN now, I can collect it in 4 moves: (7, 8) → (7, 7) → (7, 6) → (7, 5) → (7, 4) → (7, 3).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The apple at (2, 8) is on the same row and only 5 cells left. The apple at (7, 3) is 5 cells down.\n\nGoing DOWN toward (7, 3) seems more direct right now. Let me verify the path is clear:\n- (7, 8) current position\n- (7, 7) - clear \".\"\n- (7, 6) - checking row 6: \". . . . T T T T T T\" - position (7, 6) is \"T\" (my own body!)\n\nOh no! There's my body at (7, 6). So going DOWN would hit my own body quickly. That's a dead end.\n\nLet me verify LEFT path toward (2, 8):\n- (7, 8) current\n- (6, 8) - clear \".\"\n- (5, 8) - checking row 8: \". T A . T . . 1 T T\" - position (5, 8) is \".\" - clear\n- (4, 8) - position (4, 8) is \"T\" (my own body!)\n\nWait, my body is at (4, 8) too. So LEFT also hits my body in 3 moves.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 9):\n- (7, 9) - clear \".\"\n- Next turn would need to continue somewhere from row 9\n\nThis is constrained! I'm hemmed in by my own body. I need to find a way out. Let me reconsider DOWN more carefully.\n\nActually, I see (7, 6) shows as \"T\" on the board. Let me check my body list again: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), ...]. Yes, (7, 6) is indeed my body.\n\nSo DOWN hits my body immediately. LEFT also hits my body after 3 moves. UP to (7, 9) seems like the only real option to keep moving.\n\n**Decision:** Go UP to (7, 9), which keeps me alive and maintains flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: UP to (7, 9)\n- Next: Reassess from (7, 9).

This will also give me a 20-1 lead.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 8)\n2. Continue LEFT to (4, 8) \n3. Continue LEFT to (3, 8)\n4. Continue LEFT to (2, 8) - eat apple!\n5.

But I need space to maneuver.\n- **DOWN to (5, 7)**: Moves toward the middle of the board, opens up movement toward apples at (6, 2) or eventually (2, 4).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 0), which is in the lower region. Moving DOWN keeps me in closer proximity but might position me better for future apple collection since the apple at (6, 2) is nearby.\n\nHowever, UP gives me more open space and keeps me away from the enemy's general area. Looking ahead:\n- If I move UP to (5, 9), I can then navigate left around my body to reach the (2, 8) apple region\n- DOWN is also viable but puts me in a more confined space with the enemy closer\n\nGiven the need for flexibility and future options, UP seems like the better choice to maintain control of the upper portion of the board.\n\n**Plan for next moves:**\n1. Move UP to (5, 9)\n2. Then navigate around my body to reach apples at (2, 8) or (2, 4)\n3. Keep distance from enemy snake moving in the lower half\n\nUP",

Looking at row 9:\n```\n 9 . . . . T 1 T T . .\n```\nPositions: (0,9)=., (1,9)=., (2,9)=., (3,9)=., (4,9)=T, (5,9)=1 (my head), (6,9)=T, (7,9)=T, (8,9)=., (9,9)=.\n\nSo my head is at (5, 9), and:\n- LEFT to (4, 9): T (my body) - DEATH\n- RIGHT to (6, 9): T (my body) - DEATH\n- UP to (5, 10): OUT OF BOUNDS - DEATH\n- DOWN to (5, 8): Let me check row 8:\n```\n 8 . . A . T T T T T T\n```\nPositions: (0,8)=., (1,8)=., (2,8)=A, (3,8)=., (4,8)=T, (5,8)=T, (6,8)=T, (7,8)=T, (8,8)=T, (9,8)=T\n\nSo (5, 8) is \"T\" - my body - DEATH\n\nThis is a catastrophic situation. My snake is completely boxed in. All four directions lead to death.\n\nLet me verify once more by checking my body list:\n- Head: (5, 9)\n- Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)]\n\nYes, my body segments surrounding me are:\n- (5, 8) below\n- (6, 8) and (6, 9) to the right\n- (4, 9) to the left\n\nI'm trapped in a dead-end snake configuration with no legal move available. This is a loss condition - any move I make will result in my death.\n\nSince I must make a move and all moves lead to death, I'll choose the move that seems least immediately catastrophic, though it doesn't matter. I'll go DOWN since that's at least toward the center of the board and away from the edge.\n\nDOWN",
