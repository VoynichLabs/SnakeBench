My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too. The last move was None, so I haven't moved yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where I can go. Since I'm at (5,2), my possible moves are UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves. The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too.

But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves.

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, so I'm playing this Snake game and I need to decide my next move. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and I'm Snake #0, currently at (5,2). My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too. The last move was None, so I haven't moved yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where I can go. Since I'm at (5,2), my possible moves are UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves. The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's dive into this problem. The user is playing a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake is at position (3,2) with an empty body, indicating it's just the head. The apples are located at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,5) with a body segment at (3,5). \n\nThe user's previous move was LEFT, which took their snake from (4,2) to (3,2). The rationale for that move was to move closer to an apple and avoid the enemy. Now, the user needs to decide the next move, considering the current positions of the apples and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apples are at (2,5) and (1,3). The enemy is at (4,5), which is in the same row as the apple at (2,5). Moving towards (2,5) might risk encountering the enemy. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) could be safer and closer.\n\nThe user's current position is (3,2). Possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), or RIGHT to (4,2). Moving RIGHT would take the snake back to (4,2), which might not be ideal. Moving DOWN to (3,1) moves away from the apples. Moving LEFT to (2,2) brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and further from the enemy. Moving UP to (3,3) also brings the snake closer to (1,3) but keeps it in the same column.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position at (4,5), it's better to avoid that area. Therefore, moving towards the apple at (1,3) seems like a safer and more strategic move. Between moving LEFT to (2,2) and UP to (3,3), moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple and further from potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, the user's snake is currently small, so growing by eating an apple is crucial. The apple at (1,3) is two moves away if the snake moves LEFT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3), and then LEFT to (1,3). Alternatively, moving UP to (3,3) and then LEFT twice would also reach (1,3) in three moves. Therefore, moving LEFT first seems more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, moving LEFT to (2,2) opens up the possibility of moving towards (1,3) without being in the same row as the enemy. It also allows the snake to maneuver more freely in the lower half of the board, avoiding potential collisions with the enemy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best move is to go LEFT to (2,2), positioning the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm at (3,2) and need to decide my next move.

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, so I'm playing this Snake game and I need to decide my next move. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and I'm Snake #0, currently at (5,2). My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too. The last move was None, so I haven't moved yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where I can go. Since I'm at (5,2), my possible moves are UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves. The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's dive into this problem. The user is playing a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake is at position (3,2) with an empty body, indicating it's just the head. The apples are located at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,5) with a body segment at (3,5). \n\nThe user's previous move was LEFT, which took their snake from (4,2) to (3,2). The rationale for that move was to move closer to an apple and avoid the enemy. Now, the user needs to decide the next move, considering the current positions of the apples and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apples are at (2,5) and (1,3). The enemy is at (4,5), which is in the same row as the apple at (2,5). Moving towards (2,5) might risk encountering the enemy. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) could be safer and closer.\n\nThe user's current position is (3,2). Possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), or RIGHT to (4,2). Moving RIGHT would take the snake back to (4,2), which might not be ideal. Moving DOWN to (3,1) moves away from the apples. Moving LEFT to (2,2) brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and further from the enemy. Moving UP to (3,3) also brings the snake closer to (1,3) but keeps it in the same column.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position at (4,5), it's better to avoid that area. Therefore, moving towards the apple at (1,3) seems like a safer and more strategic move. Between moving LEFT to (2,2) and UP to (3,3), moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple and further from potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, the user's snake is currently small, so growing by eating an apple is crucial. The apple at (1,3) is two moves away if the snake moves LEFT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3), and then LEFT to (1,3). Alternatively, moving UP to (3,3) and then LEFT twice would also reach (1,3) in three moves. Therefore, moving LEFT first seems more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, moving LEFT to (2,2) opens up the possibility of moving towards (1,3) without being in the same row as the enemy. It also allows the snake to maneuver more freely in the lower half of the board, avoiding potential collisions with the enemy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best move is to go LEFT to (2,2), positioning the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm at (3,2) and need to decide my next move.

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, so I'm playing this Snake game and I need to decide my next move. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and I'm Snake #0, currently at (5,2). My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too. The last move was None, so I haven't moved yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where I can go. Since I'm at (5,2), my possible moves are UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves. The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's dive into this problem. The user is playing a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake is at position (3,2) with an empty body, indicating it's just the head. The apples are located at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,5) with a body segment at (3,5). \n\nThe user's previous move was LEFT, which took their snake from (4,2) to (3,2). The rationale for that move was to move closer to an apple and avoid the enemy. Now, the user needs to decide the next move, considering the current positions of the apples and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apples are at (2,5) and (1,3). The enemy is at (4,5), which is in the same row as the apple at (2,5). Moving towards (2,5) might risk encountering the enemy. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) could be safer and closer.\n\nThe user's current position is (3,2). Possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), or RIGHT to (4,2). Moving RIGHT would take the snake back to (4,2), which might not be ideal. Moving DOWN to (3,1) moves away from the apples. Moving LEFT to (2,2) brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and further from the enemy. Moving UP to (3,3) also brings the snake closer to (1,3) but keeps it in the same column.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position at (4,5), it's better to avoid that area. Therefore, moving towards the apple at (1,3) seems like a safer and more strategic move. Between moving LEFT to (2,2) and UP to (3,3), moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple and further from potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, the user's snake is currently small, so growing by eating an apple is crucial. The apple at (1,3) is two moves away if the snake moves LEFT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3), and then LEFT to (1,3). Alternatively, moving UP to (3,3) and then LEFT twice would also reach (1,3) in three moves. Therefore, moving LEFT first seems more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, moving LEFT to (2,2) opens up the possibility of moving towards (1,3) without being in the same row as the enemy. It also allows the snake to maneuver more freely in the lower half of the board, avoiding potential collisions with the enemy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best move is to go LEFT to (2,2), positioning the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm at (3,2) and need to decide my next move.

            "rationale": "<think>Okay, so I'm playing this Snake game and I need to decide my next move. Let's see, the board is 10x10, and I'm Snake #0, currently at (5,2). My body is empty, so I'm just a single point. There are apples at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body too. The last move was None, so I haven't moved yet.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where I can go. Since I'm at (5,2), my possible moves are UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). But I have to be careful not to hit walls or other snakes.\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest one is at (2,5). Let me calculate the distance. From (5,2) to (2,5): the x distance is 3 to the left, and y is 3 up. So that's 6 moves. Another apple is at (1,3), which is 4 left and 1 up, so 5 moves. The apple at (8,5) is 3 right and 3 up, which is 6 moves. The one at (4,9) is 1 left and 7 up, which is 8 moves. The last one is at (0,6), which is 5 left and 4 up, 9 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). But I also need to consider the enemy snake at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I'll be moving left and up, but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) might be quicker.\n\nWait, but if I move towards (1,3), I have to go left and up. Let's see: from (5,2), moving left to (4,2). Then from (4,2), I can go left to (3,2), then to (2,2), then up to (2,3), then to (1,3). That's 5 moves. Alternatively, moving up first to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I also need to check if the enemy snake will block me. Snake #1 is at (6,5). If I go towards (2,5), I might run into the enemy if it moves towards me. But since both snakes are starting, maybe I can reach the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) because it's closer in terms of steps. Let's count steps again. From (5,2) to (2,5): x decreases by 3, y increases by 3. So 6 steps. To (1,3): x decreases by 4, y increases by 1. So 5 steps. So (1,3) is closer. So maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut wait, if I go to (1,3), I have to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block me. The enemy is at (6,5). If I move left and up, the enemy might move towards me, but since we're both starting, I think I can reach (1,3) before the enemy can get there.\n\nSo my next move should be LEFT to (4,2). Then I can continue moving left and up towards (1,3). Alternatively, maybe moving UP first to (5,3) would be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (2,5). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move towards (2,5), I might have a path that's less likely to be blocked. Because the enemy is on the right side, moving towards the left might be safer. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) is on the left side, which might be safer.\n\nI think I should start moving left to (4,2). That's the first step towards both (1,3) and (2,5). So my next move is LEFT.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm starting at (5,2) and need to choose a direction. The closest apples are at (1,3) and (2,5). I'll move LEFT to (4,2) to head towards these apples. I need to avoid the enemy at (6,5), so moving left seems safer. Next move: LEFT.",

            "rationale": "<think>Alright, let's dive into this problem. The user is playing a multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. Their snake is at position (3,2) with an empty body, indicating it's just the head. The apples are located at (0,6), (1,3), (8,5), (4,9), and (2,5). There's also an enemy snake, Snake #1, at (4,5) with a body segment at (3,5). \n\nThe user's previous move was LEFT, which took their snake from (4,2) to (3,2). The rationale for that move was to move closer to an apple and avoid the enemy. Now, the user needs to decide the next move, considering the current positions of the apples and the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apples are at (2,5) and (1,3). The enemy is at (4,5), which is in the same row as the apple at (2,5). Moving towards (2,5) might risk encountering the enemy. Alternatively, moving towards (1,3) could be safer and closer.\n\nThe user's current position is (3,2). Possible moves are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), or RIGHT to (4,2). Moving RIGHT would take the snake back to (4,2), which might not be ideal. Moving DOWN to (3,1) moves away from the apples. Moving LEFT to (2,2) brings the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and further from the enemy. Moving UP to (3,3) also brings the snake closer to (1,3) but keeps it in the same column.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position at (4,5), it's better to avoid that area. Therefore, moving towards the apple at (1,3) seems like a safer and more strategic move. Between moving LEFT to (2,2) and UP to (3,3), moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple and further from potential threats.\n\nAdditionally, the user's snake is currently small, so growing by eating an apple is crucial. The apple at (1,3) is two moves away if the snake moves LEFT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3), and then LEFT to (1,3). Alternatively, moving UP to (3,3) and then LEFT twice would also reach (1,3) in three moves. Therefore, moving LEFT first seems more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, moving LEFT to (2,2) opens up the possibility of moving towards (1,3) without being in the same row as the enemy. It also allows the snake to maneuver more freely in the lower half of the board, avoiding potential collisions with the enemy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best move is to go LEFT to (2,2), positioning the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n</think>\n\nAlright, I'm at (3,2) and need to decide my next move.

The enemy is at (4,5). The previous move was LEFT to get closer to an apple and avoid the enemy. The user needs to continue moving strategically.\n\nLooking at the board, moving LEFT to (2,2) would position the user closer to the apple at (1,3) and further from the enemy at (4,5). Alternatively, moving UP to (3,3) also moves closer to (1,3) but keeps the user in the same column, which might be riskier if the enemy moves down.\n\nConsidering the enemy's position, moving LEFT to (2,2) seems safer. This move keeps the user in a lower-risk area and progresses towards the apple. It also allows for more flexibility in future moves, avoiding potential collisions with the enemy.\n\nMoreover, moving LEFT first sets the user up for a clearer path to the apple at (1,3) without immediate threats. It's a cautious yet strategic move that prioritizes growth while minimizing risks.\n\n</think>\n\n After considering the board state and the positions of the apples and the enemy, moving LEFT to (2,2) seems like the safest and most strategic move. This positions the user closer to the apple at (1,3) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy at (4,5). By moving left, the user is also in a better position to avoid potential collisions and set up for future moves that could lead to capturing more apples.",
