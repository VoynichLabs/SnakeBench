I'd like to get closer to some of these apples to increase my chances of growing.\n\nI notice that there's an apple at (1, 9) which is relatively close to my current position. I could try to move towards it, but I'd have to be careful not to run into the wall or another snake.\n\nAnother option is to move towards the apple at (2, 6), which is a bit farther away, but still within reach. This might be a safer option since I'd have more space to maneuver.\n\nI also notice that Snake #2 is at position (8, 8), which is relatively far from me, so I don't need to worry about it for now.\n\nAfter considering these options, I think I'll move towards the apple at (2, 6). I'll try to move up to get closer to it.\n\nNext move: UP"

The closest apple to me is at (4, 8), which is directly to my left.\n\nSince my goal is to collect apples without running into walls, other snakes, or myself, I should prioritize moving towards the closest apple. Moving left would put me at (7, 8), which is closer to the apple at (4, 8) and also avoids the enemy snake at (7, 7) for now.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns will be to continue moving left towards the apple at (4, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid potential collisions.\n\nNext, I'll decide my move based on this strategy. Since moving left is the best option to get closer to the apple, my next move will be:\n\nLEFT"
