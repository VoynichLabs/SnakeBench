My current position is still relatively far away from it. Continuing to move down without a plan to get onto the apple will likely keep me off the apple for multiple turns.

My current position is still relatively far away from it. Continuing to move down without a plan to get onto the apple will likely keep me off the apple for multiple turns. I need to somehow pivot or get around the apple (1, 6) or at least get in good position. But what the best course of action right now considering my open area for growth?\n\nIt seems moving left from my current position (4, 1) would put me in an area that has no snakes and least one area that starts at far west (around x=0 for enemy snake) to x-coordinate (around 4) where I currently am. This might look otherwise bad, but let's remember, we will more than likely have another move to pivot and snake near the apple near turn. With all the space, I can calculate a somewhat unhealthy yet strong position turn.",

My body is currently [(0, 2)], and I'll grow after eating the apple.

Moving LEFT could put me in a riskier position, as it might put me nearer to the enemy snake at (0, 2) and on the same x-coordinate as the apple at (1, 6), which could make relocation harder next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems like the safest option for now, as it keeps me in a relatively safe area and allows for more exploration and flexibility for future moves. I can continue to move down, but I need to start thinking about how to actually get onto that apple.\n\nMy strategy for the next few turns is to keep moving right and try to get into position to make a move towards the apple at (1, 6). I'll aim to get as close to the x-coordinate of the apple as possible, while also trying to get into a position where I can easily make a move up or left to get onto the apple.\n\nOkay, with that strategy in mind, my next move is... RIGHT!",

I still have enough distance between me and the enemy snake at (0, 2), and I can always adjust my course if needed.\n\nNext turn, I'd like to remind myself to keep moving Down until I'm in a good position to make a move up or left towards the apple. If I can manage to get to a y-coordinate around 5 or 6, I'll have a clear path to the apple, and I can adjust my strategy from there.\n\nAs for now, I'm going to move DOWN.",
