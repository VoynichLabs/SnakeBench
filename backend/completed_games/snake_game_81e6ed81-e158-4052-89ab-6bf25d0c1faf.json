Keeps X alignment at 2.\n    *   *Future considerations:* If I take this path `(2,8)->(2,7)->(2,6)->(3,6)`, my body will be at `(2,6)` when I eat the apple. This blocks the immediate Left move towards the next apple at `(2,1)`. I would be forced to move Down to `(3,5)` or Right, staying on column 3 longer, which is slightly less efficient for the subsequent target at `(2,1)`.\n2.  **RIGHT (to 3, 8):** Moves closer to the apple at (3, 6) in X. Aligns X with 3 immediately.\n    *   *Future considerations:* If I take this path `(2,8)->(3,8)->(3,7)->(3,6)`, my body will be at `(3,7)` when I eat the apple. The square to my Left `(2,6)` will be free. This allows me to turn Left immediately after eating, aligning perfectly with column 2 to head straight down to the secondary apple at `(2,1)`.\n3.  **UP (to 2, 9):** Moves away from all targets. Bad.\n4.  **LEFT (to 1, 8):** Moves away from the primary target and towards a wall. Bad.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the best strategic move. It secures the path to the closest apple at (3, 6) while setting up a cleaner transition to the next apple at (2, 1). The enemy is too far to pose a threat or contest this specific apple efficiently.\n\n**Strategy for next turns**\nMove RIGHT, then DOWN, DOWN to eat the apple at (3, 6).

Moving RIGHT aligns my x-coordinate with this apple. While moving DOWN also reduces distance, moving RIGHT allows me to approach the apple from the top (via 3,8 -> 3,7 -> 3,6). This is advantageous because after eating the apple at (3, 6), my tail will be at (3, 7), leaving (2, 6) open. This permits an immediate LEFT turn to align with the next apple at (2, 1), optimizing the path for the subsequent target.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is far away in the bottom right quadrant, likely targeting the apples at (4, 2), (7, 1), or (3, 3).\n\n**Opportunity Analysis**\n1.  **Apple (2, 8):** Distance 2. I have a clear, uncontested path to this apple. Securing it is a guaranteed point and puts me in a safe position at the top of the board.\n2.  **Apple (3, 3):** Distance 4. The enemy is also distance 4 from this, or closer if they grab (4, 2) first. It's contested and risky.\n3.  **Apple (2, 1):** Distance 5. A straight shot down, but skipping (2, 8) to go for this seems inefficient when (2, 8) is so close and safe.\n\n**Strategy Formulation**\nMy previous move (LEFT) successfully aligned me with Column 2. The most logical continuation is to proceed **UP** to (2, 7) and then to (2, 8) to consume the apple. This isolates me from the enemy (reducing collision risk) and guarantees a point. After taking (2, 8), I can head down Column 2 or 1 towards the remaining apples in the lower left.\n\n**Conclusion**\nI will move **UP** towards the apple at (2, 8).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Snake 1 is likely to move Left to (1, 1) to consume the apple at (0, 1).\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (3, 3): Close, targetable.\n    *   (5, 4): Moderate distance, direct path.\n    *   (0, 1): Dangerous, likely taken by Enemy 1.\n    *   (4, 6): Farther away.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n1.  **DOWN (1, 3):** This moves into a \"pocket\" bounded by my body at x=0 and the enemy body at y=2. Furthermore, if Snake 1 moves to (1, 1) as expected, moving to (1, 3) places us in close proximity, fighting for the (1, 2) space or risking a squeeze against the left wall. This is high risk.\n2.  **UP (1, 5):** Safe move into open space, but moves away from the high-value cluster of apples at (3, 3) and (5, 4).\n3.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** This is the optimal move.\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 4) is empty. The enemy head is at (2, 1) with a body at (2, 2), meaning the enemy can't reach (2, 4) or (2, 3) immediately.\n    *   **Objectives:** It reduces distance to both the (3, 3) and (5, 4) apples.\n    *   **Positioning:** It keeps my snake \"North\" of the enemy's horizontal wall at row 2. This allows me to traverse the board freely while the enemy is preoccupied in the bottom rows.\n\n**Strategy Strategy**\nMove **RIGHT** to (2, 4). From there, proceed to (3, 4).

This path avoids the cramped columns 0 and 1 where the enemy is expanding upwards.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**\nTarget the apple at (3, 3) via (3, 4).

It lengthens the path to the second apple at (5, 4).\n2.  **RIGHT (3, 4):**\n    *   **Efficiency:** This square is adjacent to the apple at (3, 3) (via a DOWN move next turn) and lies on the direct path to the apple at (5, 4). It allows me to \"fork\" the two targets.\n    *   **Safety:** It keeps me at Y=4, maintaining a buffer row (Y=3) above the enemy's wall at Y=2. It moves my head away from the cramped left side where the enemy is operating.\n    *   **Future Path:** From (3, 4), I can move DOWN to consume the apple at (3, 3). Since the enemy body blocks (3, 2), I can then safely exit RIGHT to (4, 3) into open space.\n\n**Strategy**\nMove **RIGHT** to (3, 4). This sets up an immediate capture of the apple at (3, 3) on the next turn while keeping the option open to pivot towards (5, 4) if the situation changes. It avoids the potential congestion on the left side of the board.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**\nMove DOWN to take the apple at (3, 3), then plan to exit RIGHT towards open space, avoiding the dead-ends against the enemy body wall at Y=2.\n\nRIGHT",
