The board is 10x10.\n\nApples are at: A1=(2, 4), A2=(9, 5), A3=(4, 2), A4=(9, 7), A5=(3, 0).\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (5, 8).\n\nMy potential moves and resulting head positions:\n1. UP: (1, 1)\n2. DOWN: (1, -1) -> Dead (Off board)\n3. LEFT: (0, 0)\n4. RIGHT: (2, 0)\n\nChecking for immediate self-collision (body collision):\nMy body list is empty except for the head (1, 0). Moving backward from (1, 0) would be to (1, -1) if the tail was (1, 1), but since the body is empty, moving backwards would only be an issue if the *previous* head position was recorded as the \"tail segment\" to avoid\u2014however, the rules specify: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since my body is empty, there is no cell directly behind my head other than the hypothetical tail which doesn't exist yet. I only need to worry about collisions with existing body segments, and since my body is empty, this rule only applies if I were already longer. The move DOWN (1, -1) is invalid due to being off-board.\n\nChecking for opponent collision:\nSnake #1 head is at (5, 8).\nIf I move UP to (1, 1): No collision with (5, 8).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 0): No collision with (5, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 0): No collision with (5, 8).\n\nChecking for head-on collision (opponent moves simultaneously):\nI need to predict Snake #1's move. Snake #1 is at (5, 8). It has no immediate apples to target. The nearest apples are A1(2, 4), A2(9, 5), A3(4, 2), A4(9, 7), A5(3, 0).\n\nSnake #1's nearest apples by Manhattan distance:\nTo A4 (9, 7): Distance is $|9-5| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5$.\nTo A2 (9, 5): Distance is $|9-5| + |5-8| = 4 + 3 = 7$.\nTo A1 (2, 4): Distance is $|2-5| + |4-8| = 3 + 4 = 7$.\nTo A3 (4, 2): Distance is $|4-5| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7$.\nTo A5 (3, 0): Distance is $|3-5| + |0-8| = 2 + 8 = 10$.\n\n(5, 8) is very close to A4 (9, 7). A likely move for Snake #1 is RIGHT to (6, 8) or DOWN to (5, 7). Given the proximity to (9, 7), RIGHT seems plausible.\n\nSafe Moves Analysis:\n1. UP to (1, 1): Good move, moves away from the bottom edge, provides options.\n2. LEFT to (0, 0): Moves to the corner. May restrict movement slightly sooner than UP, but still very safe.\n3. RIGHT to (2, 0): Moves toward A5 (3, 0). This seems like the most strategically useful move as it begins moving towards the closest apple on the bottom row.\n\nComparing UP (1, 1) and RIGHT (2, 0):\nA5 (3, 0) is 2 steps away horizontally and 0 steps vertically.\nA3 (4, 2) is 2 steps away horizontally and 2 steps up.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 0):\nMy next potential positions are (2, 1), (1, 0) [backwards], (3, 0) [apple!], (2, -1) [off-board].\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (6, 8) (targeting A4), there is no collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 0), I am 1 step away from A5 (3, 0). This seems like the fastest route to an apple.\n\nLet's evaluate the position leading to my next turn if I choose RIGHT:\nTurn 0: I am at (2, 0). Snake #1 moves (e.g., to (6, 8)).\nTurn 1: I can move RIGHT to (3, 0) and eat A5. This would be highly favorable.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 1), I am 2 steps away from the nearest apple on the same Y-level (A3 at (4, 2) is 3 steps away in distance, but requires navigating up).\n\nGiven that I have an immediate path to an apple by moving towards it, RIGHT is prioritized over UP or LEFT, provided it doesn't put me in a compromising position (which it doesn't, as the board is wide open).\n\nStrategy Note: In the early game with no established body, prioritize reaching the nearest, easiest apple. (3, 0) is one step away if I move (2, 0) first.\n\nMove chosen: RIGHT to (2, 0).\n\nLong-term plan: My immediate goal is to eat the apple at (3, 0) on Turn 1 by moving RIGHT again, unless Snake #1 positions itself threateningly or another apple becomes significantly more accessible. Given the current state, maximizing apple acquisition safety is key.\n\nRIGHT",

My next targets will likely be A3 (4, 2) or A1 (2, 4). I need to consolidate my position after growing.

If S1 moved Right (6, 7) last turn, it is now at **Head (6, 7)**. If S1 moved Up (5, 8), it is now at **Head (5, 8)**. If S1 moved Down (5, 6), it is now at **Head (5, 6)**.\n\nSince Snake #1 was at proximity to A4 (9, 7), moving RIGHT (towards 9) seems the most logical aggressive move. Let's assume **Snake #1 head is at (6, 7)** for safety calculations.\n\nMy current snake structure: Head (3, 0), Body ((2, 0), (1, 0)). Length 3.\nMy next apple targets: A3 (4, 2) (Distance 3) or A1 (2, 4) (Distance 4). A3 seems slightly easier to reach initially.\n\nMy potential moves and resulting head positions:\n1. UP: (3, 1). Safe, moves away from the bottom edge.\n2. DOWN: (3, -1). -> Dead (Off board).\n3. LEFT: (2, 0). This is part of my body. **Collision.**\n4. RIGHT: (4, 0). Safe. Moves towards X=4 (A3).\n\nChecking for self-collision:\nLEFT (2, 0) hits body. DOWN is off-board. UP and RIGHT are safe from body collision. Note that UP (3, 1) does not hit the cell directly behind my head ((2, 0) is the body segment I just left, the cell *behind* the previous head (2, 0) would be (1,0) if I were moving out of a body segment, but here I am moving away from the entire body structure). The only self-collision concern is moving backward into the segment *my tail would occupy* if the snake was longer, or hitting the body segments I just vacated. Since my body is (2,0), (1,0), moving into (2,0) is illegal. Moving into (1,0) is only illegal if that was the cell I moved *from* last turn, which it wasn't. Moving RIGHT to (4, 0) is safe. Moving UP to (3, 1) is safe.\n\nChecking for opponent collision (Assuming S1 head at (6, 7)):\n1. UP to (3, 1): No collision with (6, 7).\n2. RIGHT to (4, 0): No collision with (6, 7).\n\nChecking for head-on collision:\nIf S1 moves towards me (unlikely since they are far away), the threat is low. If S1 continues moving RIGHT to (7, 7), or UP to (6, 8), we are safe.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\nUP (3, 1): Keeps options open centrally.\nRIGHT (4, 0): Moves me one step closer to A3 (4, 2).\n\nSince my goal remains reaching apples, moving along the X-axis toward A3 (4, 2) seems marginally better than just moving up to (3, 1). Reaching (4, 0) allows me to either continue RIGHT to (5, 0) or UP to (4, 1) next turn.\n\nI choose RIGHT to advance towards the next cluster of apples on the lower levels.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Maintain a steady movement towards A3 (4, 2). Avoid moving too far into corners until I have more length to maneuver safely. Since my body is short, I should prioritize extending strategically.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy current head is (3, 0) and my body is (2, 0), (1, 0). I just ate A5 (3, 0).\nMy objective is now A3 (4, 2) or A1 (2, 4). A3 (4, 2) is closer in terms of combined moves (1 right, 2 up).\n\nMy safe moves were UP (3, 1) and RIGHT (4, 0).\nI chose to move RIGHT to (4, 0) as it directly advances my X coordinate towards A3 (4, 2).\n\nIf Snake #1 is at (6, 7): It is likely still moving generally right or up towards A4 (9, 7).\n\nMove analysis for Turn 3:\n1. UP to (4, 1): Good, moves off the edge.\n2. DOWN: Off board.\n3. LEFT to (3, 0): Hits my previous head location (which is now body segment (2, 0), wait, no. My previous head was (3,0), I left it. The cell immediately behind my current head (3,0) is (2,0). (2,0) is my body segment. **Collision if I move LEFT.** Wait, error check: My body is (2, 0), (1, 0). If I move LEFT to move into (2, 0), that is hitting my body. **LEFT is suicidal.**\n4. RIGHT to (5, 0): Safe, advances further along the bottom edge.\n\nRevisiting the safe moves based on the structure: Head (3, 0), Body ((2, 0), (1, 0)).\nThe cell immediately behind the head (3, 0) is (2, 0). (2, 0) is a body segment.\nTherefore, moving LEFT (to (2, 0)) is a guaranteed self-collision and death.\n\nValid moves: UP (3, 1) or RIGHT (4, 0).\n\nComparing UP (3, 1) vs RIGHT (4, 0):\nRIGHT (4, 0) gets me one step closer to A3 (4, 2).\nUP (3, 1) moves me higher, but keeps me further from A3 horizontally.\n\nAdvancing horizontally towards the next target (4, 2) is preferred over moving vertically into an empty space when a horizontal path is available adjacent to the body structure.\n\nI confirm the move RIGHT (4, 0).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP\n\nTurn: 4 / 150\n\nApples at: (2, 4), (9, 5), (4, 2), (9, 7)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\n  - Snake #1 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (4, 0)\n  - Body: (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (7, 7) or similar, Body: unknown length.

UP is the best move.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move UP twice more to reach (4, 2) and eat A3.

UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\nChecking for opponent collision (Assume S1 is still far, e.g., (7, 7)): Safe for UP and RIGHT moves.\n\nThe move UP to (4, 2) guarantees eating A3. This is the clear best move.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Eat A3. Then my snake is length 5. Next targets A1 (2, 4) or A2 (9, 5). A1 (2, 4) is now 2 squares diagonally away. I will focus on A1 next. I will need to curve left or right away from my current vertical alignment (X=4) to start heading leftward (towards X=2).\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nRIGHT",

However, X=4 is the center column, which might be riskier if S1 decides to move towards the center later.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 1): Next move could be LEFT again to (2, 1) or UP to (3, 2).\nIf I move UP to (4, 2): Next move could be UP to (4, 3) or LEFT to (3, 2).\n\nTo get to (2, 4) from (4, 1) requires 2 steps left and 3 steps up (5 total steps minimum without zig-zagging).\nMove sequence (L, L, U, U, U) -> (2, 4)\nMove sequence (U, U, U, L, L) -> (2, 4)\n\nIf I choose LEFT (3, 1), I am prioritizing horizontal movement towards the near corner.\nIf I choose UP (4, 2), I am prioritizing vertical movement.\n\nSince A1 is further North than it is West (3 units North vs 2 units West), prioritizing UP might seem better, but the move LEFT (3, 1) creates better immediate maneuvering capability by getting me off the main central column (X=4) where I just built a long tail. Moving LEFT secures a better initial approach angle towards the corner (2, 4).\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move towards A1 (2, 4) via a sequence of LEFT and UP moves. Avoid the bottom edge completely. Once A1 is eaten, evaluate the situation again; A2 (9, 5) would then be the primary target, requiring a full reversal of direction. Stay safe from S1 by maintaining decent separation (S1 appears to be favoring the right side of the board).\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nHead (4, 1), Body ((4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)).

This is my previous head location (the move I made last turn). Safe move IF it is not occupied by body. My body segments now are (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0). (4, 1) is safe from body. If I move RIGHT, I backtrack, which is usually inefficient.\n\nChecking for self-collision: DOWN (3, 0) hits body. **DOWN is illegal.**\n\nComparing safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\nRIGHT (4, 1) is backtracking. Inefficient.\nUP (3, 2) vs LEFT (2, 1). Both are good steps towards (2, 4).\nMoving LEFT to (2, 1) gets me into the target column (X=2) faster. This allows my next move to be UP to (2, 2), or UP to (2, 3) if I move UP from (2, 1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 1): Path to (2, 4) is 3 UP moves. Total 4 moves.\nIf I move UP to (3, 2): Path to (2, 4) is 1 LEFT, 2 UP moves. Total 3 moves if I prioritize LEFT next.\n\n(3, 1) -> (2, 1) [L] -> (2, 2) [U] -> (2, 3) [U] -> (2, 4) [U]. Total 4 moves.\n(3, 1) -> (3, 2) [U] -> (2, 2) [L] -> (2, 3) [U] -> (2, 4) [U]. Total 4 moves.\n\nBoth moves seem equally efficient in terms of steps remaining. I will choose LEFT (2, 1) because it immediately puts me on the optimal X coordinate (X=2) required to reach A1.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue aiming precisely for A1 (2, 4) via successive UP moves from X=2. After eating A1, re-evaluate distance to A2 (9, 5). Given the board width, I will likely need to turn around completely, so I should enjoy the process of moving towards A1 before worrying about the reversal needed for A2.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\nUP\n\nTurn: 6 / 150\n\nApples at: (2, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 2\n  - Snake #1 apples: 0\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (2, 2)\n  - Body: (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)\n  - Apples collected: 2\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head position still rough guess, let's assume it's around (8, 7) or (9, 7) if eating A4 (9, 7).\n\nBoard state (Approximated based on S0 move to (2,2) and S1 likely move to (9,7)):\n 9 . . . . . . . . .

Body: [(5, 0)]. Length 2.\nThe rationale seems to belong to a different game instance or a much later turn state, as it describes a head at (3, 4) and a substantial body length. I must ignore the content of the previous rationale and base my decision only on the current board state provided for Turn 6.\n\n**Current State (Turn 6):**\nMy Head: (6, 0)\nMy Body: [(5, 0)]\nApples left: (2, 4) [A1], (9, 5) [A2], (4, 2) [A3], (9, 7) [A4], (9, 0) [A5].\nEnemy Head: (8, 8)\n\n**Goal:** Eat apples, survive.\nThe nearest apple is A5 at (9, 0). It requires moving Right twice.\n\n**Potential Moves from (6, 0):**\nPossible next positions: (6, 1) [UP], (6, -1) [DOWN - illegal], (5, 0) [LEFT - self collision], (7, 0) [RIGHT].\n\n1. **UP (6, 1):** Safe. Moves away from the nearest target (9, 0) but keeps options open on the Y-axis.\n2. **DOWN:** Illegal (Off board).\n3. **LEFT (5, 0):** Illegal (Collision with body segment at (5, 0)).\n4. **RIGHT (7, 0):** Safe. Moves toward A5 (9, 0).\n\n**Evaluation:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 0) directly pursues the nearest food item (9, 0) and is safe.\n\n**Enemy Position Check (Snake #1 at (8, 8)):**\nSnake #1 is far away and poses no collision threat this turn.\n\n**Strategy:** Prioritize eating the closest accessible apple A5 at (9, 0).\n\nMove RIGHT to (7, 0). This sets up reaching (9, 0) in two more turns if the path remains clear (assuming the enemy doesn't suddenly move South or East rapidly, which is unlikely given its isolated position).\n\nLong-term plan: Move aggressively towards (9, 0). Then assess next closest food. A1 (2, 4) is the next closest safe target after A5, requiring significant movement towards the center/top-left.\n\nRIGHT",

My body occupies (8, 0) and (7, 0).\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (9, 6) and (9, 7). They seem to be moving up the right edge as well, but are behind me.\n\n**Target Selection:**\nThe nearest apple is A2 at (9, 5).\nDistance from (9, 0) to (9, 5) is 5 moves UP.\n\n**1. Evaluate Moves from (9, 0):**\n\nMy current position is at the edge (X=9, Y=0). Only UP and LEFT are valid board moves.\n\n*   **UP (9, 1):** Moves towards the closest apple (9, 5).\n    *   *Self Collision Check:* (9, 1) is not in {(9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0)}. Safe.\n    *   *Enemy Collision Check:* Enemy head is at (9, 6). They are not moving near (9, 1) this turn unless they move aggressively down, which is unlikely given they are currently moving up the edge.\n\n*   **LEFT (8, 0):** Moves onto my current body segment (8, 0). **Illegal - Self Collision (Moving onto segment right behind the head).**\n\n*   **DOWN:** Illegal (Off board, Y= -1).\n\n*   **RIGHT:** Illegal (Off board, X= 10).\n\n**2. Selection:**\nThe only safe, non-backward move is UP, which directly chases the nearest apple (9, 5).\n\n**Prediction for Enemy Move:**\nEnemy at (9, 6). They are likely to continue moving UP towards (9, 7) or (9, 8) to stay along this edge. If they move UP to (9, 7), they are safe. If they move DOWN towards (9, 5), they will challenge for the apple. If they move LEFT to (8, 6), they are safe. My move UP to (9, 1) is unlikely to cause an immediate conflict.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP along the right edge (X=9) towards (9, 5). Once (9, 5) is eaten, the next closest apple is (2, 4). I will then need to traverse the board, likely moving LEFT at Y=5 or Y=6.\n\nUP is the only viable and desirable move.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

Last move was RIGHT (from some initial state).\n2. Resulted in Head: (9, 0). Body: [(8, 0), (7, 0)]. Apples: 3. (This contradicts the provided current state for Turn 9).\n\n**I must proceed based on the *Current State* provided *before* the last move analysis:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 9):**\nMy Head: (9, 1)\nMy Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0)]\nMy Apples: 2\nEnemy Snake #1 Head: (9, 5), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7)], Apples: 2 (Based on my analysis of the board rendering, Snake 1 is at (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7) if T in the rendering represents the tail moving up, but the canonical list says Head: (9, 5), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7)]).\n\nApples at: A1=(2, 4), A2=(4, 2), A3=(6, 2), A4=(6, 8), A5=(7, 2).\n*(Note: The board rendering uses A for apples, but the list above defines 5 apples. Let's map the rendering to the list if possible)*\nBoard rendering shows A at: (6, 8), (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2) -- Wait, the board only shows 4 'A' markers based on the simple ASCII art key provided in the setup:\n(6, 8) -> A rendered at row 8, col 6 $\\rightarrow$ Yes.\n(2, 4) -> A rendered at row 4, col 2 $\\rightarrow$ Yes.\n(4, 2) -> A rendered at row 2, col 4 $\\rightarrow$ Yes.\n(6, 2) -> A rendered at row 2, col 6 $\\rightarrow$ Yes.\n(7, 2) -> A rendered at row 2, col 7 $\\rightarrow$ Yes.\n\nSo, 5 apples exist at: (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 2).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:** Head (9, 5). Body [(9, 6), (9, 7)]. This snake looks stacked vertically on the right edge.\n\n**Target Identification (Distance from (9, 1)):**\n1. (9, 5) [Apple]: Distance 4 (UP)\n2. (2, 4) [Apple]: Distance 7 left, 3 up.\n3. (4, 2) [Apple]: Distance 5 left, 1 up. If I move UP to (9, 2), then LEFT.\n4. (6, 2) [Apple]: Distance 3 left, 1 up. If I move UP to (9, 2), then LEFT.\n5. (7, 2) [Apple]: Distance 2 left, 1 up. If I move UP to (9, 2), then LEFT. (This looks like the best option after moving toward the edge stack).\n\nThe closest apple seems to be (9, 5) in Manhattan distance if we ignore board boundaries, but since my head is at (9, 1), moving UP 4 times reaches (9, 5). Wait, (9, 5) is occupied by the ENEMY HEAD. This means this apple must have been eaten OR the configuration listed is for Turn 9, and the enemy moved *onto* (9, 5) while an apple was there, or the apple list provided is what *remains*.\n\nLet's re-read the goal: \"**Apples at: (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 2)**\"\nThis is the list of apples *currently* on the board for Turn 9.\nSnake #1 Head is at (9, 5). Since there is no apple listed at (9, 5), the enemy is blocking the potential path upwards if we were interested in that location, but that location is not an apple.\n\n**Re-evaluating Closest Apples to (9, 1):**\n1. (7, 2): Distance = 2 left + 1 up = 3 moves. Target move sequence: UP, LEFT, LEFT (or LEFT, UP, LEFT, etc.)\n2. (6, 2): Distance = 3 left + 1 up = 4 moves.\n3. (4, 2): Distance = 5 left + 1 up = 6 moves.\n4. (2, 4): Distance = 7 left + 3 up = 10 moves.\n5. (6, 8): Distance = 3 left + 7 up = 10 moves.\n\nThe closest apple is **(7, 2)**. This requires moving UP first (to (9, 2)) to clear the edge before heading left efficiently.\n\n**Move evaluation from (9, 1):**\nMy current body segments are (9, 0) and (8, 0). The tail is (8, 0).\n\n1. **UP to (9, 2):**\n    *   Safe from self-collision? Yes. (9, 2) is clear.\n    *   Collision with Enemy #1 (Head at (9, 5), Body at (9, 6), (9, 7))? No.\n    *   This is heading towards (7, 2).\n\n2. **LEFT to (8, 1):**\n    *   Safe from self-collision? Yes. (8, 1) is clear.\n    *   Collision with Enemy? No.\n    *   This sets up a path towards (7, 2) via (8, 2) -> (7, 2). Distance is 1 (to 8, 1) + 1 (to 8, 2) or (7, 1) + (7, 2).\n\n3. **DOWN / RIGHT:** Off board. Illegal.\n\n**Comparing UP (9, 2) vs LEFT (8, 1):**\nBoth moves are safe and start the convergence towards (7, 2).\n\n*   If UP to (9, 2): Next move could be LEFT to (8, 2), then LEFT to (7, 2) (3 turns total).\n*   If LEFT to (8, 1): Next move could be UP to (8, 2), then LEFT to (7, 2) (3 turns total). Or LEFT to (7, 1), then UP to (7, 2) (3 turns total).\n\nMoving UP keeps me higher on the board, which might give more maneuvering room if the enemy stack (9, 5)-(9, 7) decides to move sideways. Since (9, 2) is one step closer to the Y-coordinate of the target apple (7, 2), I favor UP momentarily, preparing to cut across.\n\n**Enemy Prediction for Turn 9:**\nEnemy Head (9, 5). Body (9, 6), (9, 7). They are stacked vertically. They likely want to move LEFT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (9, 4) if an apple was available there, or UP. Since (6, 8) is an apple far away, moving UP seems less prioritized than moving horizontally if they want to spread out.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 5): They are safe.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (9, 4): They are safe.\n\nMy move UP to (9, 2) is highly unlikely to conflict with the enemy movement pattern unless they decide to move aggressively down the edge, which would block my path only if they reached (9, 1) or (9, 0), which they cannot do in one turn from (9, 5).\n\nI will proceed UP to maximize vertical progress while initiating the path towards the closest apple (7, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nGoal: Collect (7, 2) first, then (6, 2), then (4, 2), then (2, 4), then (6, 8). Keep collecting apples sequentially based on travel distance. Snake 1 is currently blocking the obvious path to (9, 5) if that were an apple. I will prioritize the lower apples first, moving left along Y=1 or Y=2. Moving UP now sets me up to move LEFT at Y=2.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

However, the snake list says: `* Snake #1 - Head: (8, 5), Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6)]`\nThis configuration confirms Snake #1 moved LEFT from (9, 5) to (8, 5), and its body followed: (9, 6) <- new segment, (9, 7) was the old tail and is gone.

This is hitting my own body. **DEADLY MOVE.** (Since I moved UP from (9, 1) to (9, 2), my body is now (9, 2) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0). Moving DOWN to (9, 1) means collision).\n\n4. **RIGHT:** Off board.

New Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)].*\n\nLet's re-verify the body transition based on T10 move:\nT10 Head: (9, 2). Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]. Tail was (9, 0). (8, 0) segment was lost on T9.\nIf T10 move was LEFT to (8, 2):\nNew Head: (8, 2).\nNew Body: [(9, 2), (9, 1)]. (The old tail (9, 0) is pruned, the segment (8, 0) was already pruned on T9).\nThe board shows: My Body: [(9, 2), (9, 1)]. This means my tail is at (9, 1). The segment (9, 0) must have been pruned.\nIf T10 Head was (9, 2), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]. Moving LEFT to (8, 2) means new body is [(9, 1), (9, 0)] becomes [(9, 2), (9, 1)] if the tail segment (9, 0) is pruned.\n\nLet's trust the board state provided for T11 setup:\nHead: (8, 2)\nBody: [(9, 2), (9, 1)]\nThis implies the tail segment (9, 1) was the segment that just moved out from being the tail, leaving (9, 1) as the *new* tail segment connected to (9, 2). This means the move on T10 was LEFT from (9, 2) to (8, 2), and the segment that was at (9, 0) was pruned.\nIf Body T10 End was [(9, 1), (9, 0)], then moving LEFT to (8, 2):\nNew Head (8, 2). New Body becomes [(9, 2), (9, 1)]. The tail (9, 0) is lost.\nThis means my length is 3 (Head + 2 body segments) and I gained no apple. This is consistent with the score remaining 2.\nMy Body segments are (9, 2) and (9, 1). Tail is (9, 1). The next cell back from head is (9, 2).\n\n**Current Head Location: (8, 2)**\nApples remaining at: (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 2)\nClosest Apple: (7, 2). Distance 1 Left.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1:** Head: (8, 6), Body: [(8, 5), (9, 5)]. (Confirmed from provided state).\n\n**Move Evaluation from (8, 2):**\nForbidden cell (backwards move): (9, 2).\n\n1. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n    *   Safe from self? Yes. (7, 2) is clear.\n    *   Collision with Enemy? No. Enemy is far north.\n    *   This captures Apple (7, 2)! I grow by 1. Score becomes 3.\n\n2. **UP to (8, 3):**\n    *   Safe from self? Yes. (8, 3) is clear.\n    *   Collision with Enemy? No.\n    *   Moves toward (6, 2) or (2, 4) but misses easy capture.\n\n3. **DOWN to (8, 1):**\n    *   Safe from self? Yes. (8, 1) is clear.\n    *   Collision with Enemy? No.\n    *   Wastes turn moving away from adjacent apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n    *   This moves into my body segment (9, 2). **DEADLY MOVE.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving LEFT to (7, 2) is the optimal move as it captures the nearest apple immediately, increasing length and score, and moving me closer to the next cluster of apples on the right side of the board (6, 2), (4, 2).\n\n**New Long-Term Plan:** After capturing (7, 2), my head will be at (7, 2) and my body length increases. The next closest apples are (6, 2) and (4, 2). I should continue moving generally left/down towards these.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

If it moves LEFT to (7, 7), it's safe. If it moves UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7), it's safe. Since the nearest apples are far, the enemy is likely prioritizing safety or general movement toward the clustered apples (6, 8) or (0, 9). My move LEFT is entirely safe regardless of the enemy's immediate choice, given the distance.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Capture the nearest apple (7, 2) via LEFT move.

If the game continues long enough, then we look towards (2, 4) or generally the cluster of apples on the left side.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Continue to path efficiently towards the lowest available X coordinate apple, prioritizing sequential movement on the current row (y=2) towards (4, 2).

Move LEFT to (6, 2). Was there an apple at (6, 2)? No.\nThe apples were: (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 8), (0, 9), (2, 6).\nSince (6, 2) was empty, the snake did **not** grow. The tail did not extend.\n\n**Correct State after Turn 13 (Move LEFT from (7, 2)):**\nHead: (6, 2)\nOld Body (Tail end position (9, 1) moves out): [(7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)]\nNew Body (Length 4, same as before eating if no apple was eaten): [(7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1)]\n*Wait, the prompt shows the body for Turn 14 as: Head: (5, 2), Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)]*. This implies the move on Turn 13 was to (5, 2) OR that the state provided at the top reflects the outcome of Turn 13 *already*.\n\nSince the prompt explicitly states: \"Turn: 14 / 150\" and provides the current snake state:\n**Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (5, 2), Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)] (Length 5)**\nThis means the LAST MOVE PICK (LEFT) must have been executed leading to this state, and that move must have resulted in EATING an apple, likely implying the apple at (4, 2) was closer than realized, or the previous state description was slightly off regarding snake length/position relative to the goal stated in the rationale.\n\nLet's assume the provided current state *is* the result of the move from Turn 13.\nIf Last Head was (7, 2) and the body was [(8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1)] (Length 4).\nIf the move resulted in Head (5, 2) and Body [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)]. This implies the snake gained 1 segment and moved 2 units left, which is impossible in one move.\n\n**Conclusion on State Discrepancy:** I must strictly follow the state provided at the beginning of Turn 14, ignoring potential inconsistencies derived from my rationale for Turn 13, as the game resolution system dictates the current board state.\n\n**Current State for Turn 14:**\nHead: H = (5, 2)\nBody: B = [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)] (Length L=5)\nTail: (9, 2) is the 4th segment, (9, 2) is the 5th segment?

Body segments follow. If Body list has N elements, total length is N+1.*\nBody list has 4 elements: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)]. Total Length L = 5.\nThe tail is (9, 2).\n\nApples remaining: A = {(2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 8), (0, 9), (2, 6)}\nEnemy #1 Head: E1 = (6, 7). E1 Body: B1 = [(7, 7), (8, 7)]. L1 = 3.\n\n**Objective:** Move from (5, 2). The closest apple is (4, 2).\n\n**1. Check Move Options from (5, 2):**\n\n*   **Tail segment:** The position where the tail will vacate if we move (if we don't eat) is currently (9, 2). *(This is only relevant for very long snakes or if we move into a space that will become occupied when the tail shifts, but generally, only the current body segments matter for immediate collision).*\n\n*   **Forbidden Cells (Self-Collision):** The segment immediately behind the head is (6, 2).\n    *   LEFT to (4, 2): Safe spot. This eats Apple (4, 2)!\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 2): Collision with body. **FATAL.**\n    *   UP to (5, 3): Safe spot.\n    *   DOWN to (5, 1): Safe spot.\n\n**2. Enemy Collision Check (Deadly Cells):**\n*   E1 at (6, 7).\n*   E1 Body at (7, 7), (8, 7).\nAll safe moves (L, U, D) are far away from the enemy.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   Result: Eats Apple (4, 2). Score increases. Snake grows (L=6).\n    *   New Head: (4, 2). New Tail position for next turn: (9, 2) remains the tail segment unless we keep eating.\n    *   This move fulfills the goal established in the previous turn's rationale (approaching (4, 2)).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   Safe. Puts the snake in the middle of the board, further away from the current low-Y cluster of targets.\n\n*   **DOWN to (5, 1):**\n    *   Safe. Moves towards the bottom edge.\n\n**4. Selection:**\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) results in eating an apple and achieving the immediate short-term goal perfectly. This is the greedy, optimal choice if no immediate strategic risk outweighs the score gain.\n\n**Future Plan:** After eating at (4, 2), the next apple is (2, 4) or (2, 6). Moving left to (4, 2) sets us up nicely to continue left towards (2, X).\n\n**Long Term/Next Step Plan:** Continue moving LEFT towards x=0, then address the upper cluster of apples (2, 4), (2, 6), (6, 8), (0, 9). Prioritize reaching x=2 first.\n\n**Move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

If the board diagram is correct, the move LEFT in the *previous* turn (Turn 13 $\\to$ Turn 14) did NOT eat (4, 2) or the state listing is incorrect relative to the visualization.)\n\nLet's trust the Board Visualization and the Provided State information pair for the *Current Turn (14)*.\nBoard Visualization Apples: (2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (0, 3), (5, 4). **(4, 2) is NOT on the visualization.**\n\n***Re-evaluating Apples based on the Board Diagram:***\nThe board shows A at: (2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (0, 3), (5, 4).\nThe list provided explicitly states: Apples at: (2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), **(0, 3)**, **(5, 4)**.\nWait, the list in the text says (0, 3) and (5, 4). The board shows (5, 4) and (0, 3) seems missing/replaced.\nLet's strictly use the **Apples at:** list provided at the top, as that usually reflects the simulation's internal state, even if the visual ASCII map is slightly inconsistent (the ASCII map shows 5 locations too).\nA_List: {(2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (0, 3), (5, 4)}\nA_Board: {(2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (0, 3) is actually (0, 3) A, (5, 4) is actually (5, 4) A?}\n\nChecking the ASCII board again:\nRow 9: A at (0, 9)\nRow 6: A at (2, 6)\nRow 4: A at (2, 4), A at (5, 4) - *Wait, the ASCII diagram shows A at (2, 4) and A at (5, 4)*.\nRow 3: A at (0, 3)\n\nSo, the apples are: (2, 4), (0, 9), (2, 6), (0, 3), (5, 4). **This matches the text list exactly.** My previous assumption that (4, 2) was missing was based on misreading the board initially. **(4, 2) is NOT an apple.**\n\nEnemy #1 Head: E1 = (6, 7). B1 = [(7, 7), (8, 7)].\n\n**1. Evaluate Moves from H(5, 2):**\nSnake Segments (Collision Check): (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2).

Tail segment (9, 2) moves out.\n    *   Enemy Check: Safe from E1.\n    *   Result: Moves closer to the cluster of apples on the left side (x=0, x=2).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   Collision Check: (6, 2) is the segment immediately behind the head. **FATAL.**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   Collision Check: Cell (5, 3) is empty.

Strategy Consideration:**\nWe are currently at Y=2, with apples at Y=3, Y=4, Y=6, Y=9. The nearest path to apples involves moving left toward X=0 or X=2.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) is the most direct way to continue advancing towards the left wall and the apples at (0, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 6). Although it doesn't result in eating, it improves the grid position for subsequent moves. Moving UP or DOWN wastes a turn without positional gain relative to the primary target zone (X=0 to X=2).\n\nSince RIGHT is fatal, LEFT is the best positional move available.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT until hitting the wall (X=0) or an apple is reached. Then, assess the best zig-zag path to collect the clustered apples at X=0/X=2 while minimizing time exposed to the enemy (which is currently high up at Y=7/8).\n\n**Move Selection:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",
