Snake 1 is at (2, 0).\nApples are at (5, 8), (2, 3), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 2).\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and survive.\n\n1. **Analyze immediate safe moves:**\nMy head is at (6, 2).\n*   **UP (6, 3):** Safe. Inside the board, no snake body there. Closer to apple (2, 3) and possibly (5, 8), (8, 6), (9, 6).\n*   **DOWN (6, 1):** Safe. Inside the board. No snake body there. Moves away from most apples, but perhaps (9, 2) is reachable if I go right first.\n*   **LEFT (5, 2):** Safe. Inside the board. Closer to apple (2, 3).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 2):** Safe. Inside the board. Closer to apple (9, 2).\n\n2. **Evaluate proximity to apples:**\n\nApples:\nA1: (5, 8) - Manhattan dist: |6-5| + |2-8| = 1 + 6 = 7\nA2: (2, 3) - Manhattan dist: |6-2| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\nA3: (8, 6) - Manhattan dist: |6-8| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\nA4: (9, 6) - Manhattan dist: |6-9| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\nA5: (9, 2) - Manhattan dist: |6-9| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nApple A5 (9, 2) is the closest.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 2):** Distance to A5 becomes 2.\n*   **Move UP to (6, 3):** Distance to A5 becomes 4.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 2):** Distance to A5 becomes 4.\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 1):** Distance to A5 becomes 4.\n\nMoving RIGHT directly targets A5 (9, 2).\n\n3. **Consider the enemy snake (Snake #1):**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 0). Snake #1 is too far away to pose an immediate threat or compete for A5 (9, 2) unless they make a highly specific, lengthy detour. They are likely to go for A2 (2, 3).\n\n4. **Select the best move:**\nSince (9, 2) is the closest apple (3 moves away), moving towards it is the best strategy. Moving RIGHT gets me one step closer to (9, 2).\n\n*   If I move RIGHT (to 7, 2): Next turn, I will likely go RIGHT again (to 8, 2), and then RIGHT again to eat the apple (9, 2) on turn 2.\n\n*   If I move UP, I am going towards A2 (5 moves) or A3/A4 (6/7 moves), less efficient than A5 (3 moves).\n\n*   If I move LEFT, I am going towards A2 (5 moves), less efficient.\n\nRIGHT is the optimal first move.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move right to get A5 (9, 2). After eating A5, evaluate which of the northern apples (like A3 (8, 6) or A4 (9, 6)) are better targets, or if A2 (2, 3) is safe from Snake #1. For now, focus on A5.\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe closest apple is A5 at (9, 2), which is 3 steps away. Moving RIGHT brings me one step closer to (9, 2). The enemy snake is far away at (2, 0) and is unlikely to compete for this apple immediately.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",
