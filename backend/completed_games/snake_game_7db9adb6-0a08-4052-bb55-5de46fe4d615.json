He thinks he's safe? He thinks he can just farm while we watch? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the plays. We're at (8,6).\n- **UP** takes us to (8, 7). There's an apple nearby at (7, 8) and (9, 9). \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN** takes us to (8, 5). \n- **LEFT** takes us to (7, 6).\n- **RIGHT** takes us to (9, 6).\n\nCheck the board\u2014look at all those apples in the top right and center. Snake #1 is stuck in the bottom left corner. If we take the high ground, we control the flow of the game. We have 0 apples, he has 0 apples, but we have the positional advantage! \n\nDo we want to go for the apple at (9, 9)? Or should we cut across the middle to start boxing him in before he can even breathe? If we move LEFT, we start closing the gap. If we move UP, we're positioning for those juicy apples at (7, 8) and (9, 9) to get that length advantage. Remember: Length = Map Control. If we get longer than him, we can literally wrap around his whole life! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nI\u2019m feeling aggressive, but I need that first boost. Let's head towards the cluster. Let's grab (7, 8) and (9, 9) to secure the lead. \n\n**PLAN:** We are going to loop through the top-right quadrant to pick up size, then pivot DOWN and LEFT to meet him in the middle. If he tries to come up for air, we\u2019re going to be there waiting to shut the door! Let's get this bread!\n\nUP",

You feel me? \ud83d\ude09\n\nQuick situational scan:\n- Board: 10x10. My head = (0,2). Opponent head = (8,6). Both snakes length 1. No immediate adjacent threats. Apples visible (including one at (0,3) right above us).\n- Turn 0: simultaneous moves matter, but opponent is far \u2014 no one-step collision risk this turn.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud for the fans):\n1) Consider moves from (0,2):\n   - LEFT -> (-1,2): off-board = immediate death. Eliminated. \u274c\n   - UP -> (0,3): has an apple. Safe this turn; we'd grow to length 2 and take the lead. \u2705\n   - DOWN -> (0,1): on-board, safe now, but no immediate apple and fewer aggressive options. \u2705\n   - RIGHT -> (1,2): on-board, safe, keeps center access but skips instant growth. \u2705\n2) Collision checks: opponent at (8,6) cannot reach any of these target cells this turn; no head-to-head risk this move.\n3) Strategic preference: Being aggressive and taking apples to get the score lead is our jam \u2014 once we have more apples we can force risky head-ons. Eating (0,3) gives us that edge immediately and expands our body to start boxing space.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 shown here as our last rationale for next turn):\n- Turn 0: Eat apple at (0,3) to go up +1 point and become length 2.\n- Next turns: pivot right into the board (toward x increasing) to approach center lanes (use (1,3) then (2,3) etc.), maintain flexible escape routes (avoid getting pinned on the left wall), and watch opponent movement. If opponent drifts toward us and we retain the apple lead, force a head-on where beneficial; if they play safe, keep growing and cut off their space.\n\nAlright fam \u2014 time to snag that apple and start the aggression.

We are (8, 7) and we are looking at a board filled with potential!\n\nLet's look at the options around our head at (8, 7):\n- **UP:** Takes us to (8, 8).

If we move **LEFT**, we immediately tie the score at 1-1 by grabbing that apple at (7, 7)!  We need that length because survival is the name of the game, and more length means more ways to wrap around this opponent later! \n\nIs the opponent a threat yet? They are at (0, 3) moving around the bottom-left. We are at (8, 7). We are miles apart, which means we have total freedom to farm these apples in the top right quadrant! We\u2019re going to grab (7, 7), then look at (7, 8) or (9, 9). \n\n**THE PLAN:** Grab the (7, 7) apple this turn to even the score. Once we have that segment, we're going to sweep the top row (7, 8) and (9, 9) to get a size advantage. If Snake #1 tries to come towards the middle, we'll have the length to cut them off and force them into the wall! We're playing for the long game, but we're playing AGGRESSIVE!

We are officially at the top of the map at (8, 9). We are the ceiling, chat! We are the ceiling!\n\nLet's look at the situation! Our head is at (8, 9). Our body is trailing at (8, 8), (7, 8), and (7, 7). Snake #1 is shivering down there at (1, 6). They are so far away they need a telescope to see our greatness! \ud83d\udd2d\n\n**THE OPTIONS:**\n- **UP:** (8, 10). CHAT, NO! That\u2019s out of bounds! We aren't trying to fly, we're trying to win! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** (8, 8). That\u2019s our own body! We aren't a snack, we're the chef! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (7, 9). This is a solid play! It keeps us along the top wall and moves us toward that apple at (6, 9). \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 9). OH MY GAWD CHAT! Look at the coordinate! (9, 9) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4f It\u2019s right there! If we step on it, we hit 4 apples! We grow even LONGER! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe are going **RIGHT** to (9, 9). Why? Because we need that mass! The bigger we are, the more board we control. If we take (9, 9), we are tucked into the corner. Snake #1 is all the way across the map, so they can't trap us yet. After we grab (9, 9), we\u2019ll have to pivot down or left, but for now, we are getting that juice! \ud83e\uddc3\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 6). They might try to go for the apple at (1, 7) or (0, 7). Let them have the crumbs, we're feasting on the main course! We have the score lead; if we stay bigger and keep our head safe, they have to crash into US. We're building a fortress in the northeast!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Grab (9, 9) this turn. Then, we look to swing LEFT across the top row to (6, 9) or navigate DOWN the (9) column to cut off the right side of the board. We are playing a high-line defense!\n\nLET'S GET THAT APPLE! STAY HUNGRY!\n\nRIGHT",

No head-on risk if we go UP.\n- Getting that apple now increases our length and board control, which is exactly what we need since they lead 3\u21922.

Eating UP keeps multiple follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/UP when grown) and helps us pivot into the center to start hemming them toward the top-right.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- UP to eat (1,7) and grow to 3 apples. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Then pivot RIGHT toward center columns (x \u2248 3\u20135) to start boxing the opponent\u2019s space and cut off escape routes on the top edge.\n- Stay aggressive: if we get a height/length advantage near the top, look for a controlled head-on if they overcommit\u2014only if we have the higher apple count at that moment.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT THIS APPLE AND START THE WRAP-UP \u2014 ON GOD, ON CONTENT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nUP",

Our body is trailing through (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8), and (7, 7). Snake #1 is sitting at (1, 7) and they just grabbed an apple too!

We aren't trying to exit the simulation! That's a wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 9). Another wall! We\u2019re already in the corner, we can't go further right unless we want to clip out of bounds! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (8, 9). WAIT! That\u2019s our own neck! If we go left, we crunch our own scales! That's a \"faint\" in the chat, boys! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (9, 8). This is the ONLY move! It\u2019s the \"Get Out of Jail Free\" card! We have to move down the 9-column to stay alive and keep the pressure on! \u2705\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (9, 8). We have no other choice, but it\u2019s a BIG move regardless! By moving down the right wall, we are keeping our body coiled and ready to strike. Snake #1 is way over on the left side at (1, 7). They are currently boxed in by their own tail and the left wall. If they keep heading toward those apples at (0, 7) or (4, 7), they are just staying in their own little corner. \n\nWe have the mass advantage! 5 segments vs 4 segments! If we meet in the middle, we win the head-on! \ud83d\udca5 My plan is to ride this right wall down, then pivot back toward the center to cut off their oxygen! We want to occupy the middle of the board so they have nowhere to run! We're building a fence and they're on the wrong side of it! \ud83d\udea7\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Sneak down the (9) column, then cut LEFT across the middle (around Y=4 or Y=5) to intercept Snake #1.

Immediate suicide. NOPE. \u274c\n2) LEFT \u2192 (0,7) has an apple and is inside the board.

They\u2019re not going to contest this left-side apple this turn.\n- We\u2019re down by 1 apple. Eating (0,7) ties it up to 4\u20134, gives us extra length to start corralling space, and increases our leverage for forcing head-on collisions later.\n- Going LEFT to the apple does push us to the wall (x=0), which reduces one lateral option next move (we can\u2019t go further left), but we still have UP and DOWN from that position and we\u2019ll have more length to control lanes. That tradeoff is worth it: grow now, dominate later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this becomes our next-turn rationale):\n- LEFT to grab (0,7) and grow to 4 apples.\n- From (0,7), use UP/DOWN to pivot toward the center (x \u2248 3\u20135) while keeping my tail moving to avoid self-traps.\n- Once we match or exceed their apples, look to cut them off along the top edge and force a head-on if they overcommit. Be ruthless \u2014 only take head-on if we have the apple advantage.\n\nWe\u2019ve eliminated suicide, we get the apple, and we keep options to pivot \u2014 LET\u2019S GO!\n\nLEFT",

By moving down the 9-column, we are clearing our own body and giving ourselves the space to eventually cut across the middle. \n\nLook at the apple at (7, 6) and (7, 4). Those are OURS, chat! We're going to slide down this wall, then pivot left to seize the center. If Snake #1 tries to cross the map, we'll be waiting there with more mass and better positioning! We are the gatekeepers of the 10x10! We don't just play; we DOMINATE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue descending the 9-column until we hit Y=6 or Y=5, then swing LEFT. We need to claim the center-right territory and start gobbling those apples at (7, 6) and (7, 4) to pull ahead in score. If the rival tries to come East, we'll box them against the top or bottom walls. STAY AGGRESSIVE!\n\nDOWN",

If we go **LEFT**, we start taking control of the center and putting pressure on the rival's potential paths.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are going **LEFT** to (8, 7). Why? Because it keeps us mobile! If we go down to (9, 6), we\u2019re still hugging the rail. By moving to (8, 7), we're positioning ourselves to snag that (7, 6) apple and then pivot down to (7, 4).

Once we secure that, we\u2019re going to loop through the 7-column and 6-column to swallow those apples at (7, 4) and (6, 2). By the time Snake #1 figures out where they are, we\u2019ll have a 2-3 point lead and enough body length to cut the board in half! STAY FOCUSED!

It\u2019s wide open! We could start looping back towards the top-right. \u23eb\n- **DOWN:** (8, 6). Safe move!

We are officially entering the mid-game and it's time to show Snake #1 who really owns this 10x10 grid!\n\nLet's look at the tactical map for our next move from **(7, 7)**:\n- **UP:** (7, 8). Moves us toward the top wall. It's safe, but does it put pressure on the rival? Not really! \u23eb\n- **DOWN:** (7, 6). **OH BABY!** There is a juicy apple sitting right there! If we go down, we take the lead 5-4! THE LEAD IS EVERYTHING! \u23ec\ud83c\udf4e\n- **LEFT:** (6, 7). Puts us closer to the opponent, but there's a lot of empty space. \u2b05\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 7). **BACKWARDS!** That's our own body! We aren't trying to forfeit for the memes! \u274c\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL UPDATE:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8). They are trying to find their way out of that top-left clutter. They have apples all around them, but they are cramped! We have the entire right side and center of the board to ourselves. Look at the apple density in the 7-column and 4-column! It\u2019s a literal buffet! \ud83c\udf74\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWhy move **DOWN** to (7, 6)?\n1. **SCOREBOARD PRESSURE:** Snagging that apple at (7, 6) puts us at 5 points. If we have more points, we can play the \"Bully Game.\" If we collide heads later, we WIN the tie-break if the game ends! \ud83d\udcc8\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (7, 6), we are perfectly aligned to sweep DOWN and LEFT to grab the apples at (7, 4), (7, 3), and (6, 2). \ud83c\udfaf\n3. **Z0NING:** By occupying the 7-th column, we are creating a vertical wall that cuts the board in half. If the rival tries to come East, they have to deal with OUR length! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (7, 6) this turn. Next, we are going to dive further DOWN to (7, 4) and (7, 3). We are going to get LONG, Chat! The goal is to loop around the center and eventually trap Snake #1 against the left wall or the top-left corner where they are already struggling with space. We are playing the long game! Stay focused, stay hungry, and let's get that W! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

Instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) is legal. After moving there I keep 3 follow-ups (L/R/D), decent mobility. \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) is legal but hugs the top edge \u2014 only 2 safe follow-ups (L/R). Tightens options. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) is legal, moves toward center, and keeps 3 follow-ups (U/R/D). Best mix of aggression + mobility. \u2705\u2705\n\nEnemy read: Opponent is tucked into the top-right (head (7,7), heavy body on the 9s).

I want positional control and to keep options open to corral them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 put this in the replay as our rationale):\n- Push into the middle corridor (x\u22483\u20135) to maximize routes and threaten cuts.\n- Keep compact but mobile; avoid the top edge (don\u2019t give them chance to herd us).\n- Only commit to a head-on if we gain an apple/length advantage or they overextend into us.\n\nLet\u2019s keep pressure, stay flexible, and bait them into a corner.

We want to dominate the center! \u27a1\ufe0f\n- **LEFT:** (6, 6). This puts us closer to the rival and keeps us central. It\u2019s a solid positioning move, but is it the *aggressive* play? \u2b05\ufe0f\n- **DOWN:** (7, 5). **OH YEAH!** Look at the map, Chat! There is a vertical goldmine below us.

They are likely going to try and snag that apple at (3, 5) or head toward the cluster in the center-left. We have a higher score (5-4), which means if we can force a head-on collision later, we win the tie-break! We need to maintain this lead and get even **LONGER**. \n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (7, 5), we are:\n1. **POSTURING:** We are claiming the entire 7-column as our territory. \n2. **HUNTING:** We are lining up perfectly for the apple at (7, 4). \n3. **TRAPPING:** Once we get enough length, we can start curving LEFT to cut off Snake #1's access to the bottom half of the board. We are building a fence, and they aren't invited to the party! \ud83d\udea7\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe go DOWN to (7, 5) now. Next turn, we hit (7, 4) for another point! We keep heading south to (7, 3), then we start looking for a pivot point to the LEFT to intercept the rival. Let's make them feel the pressure! Let\u2019s get 30 before they even know what hit 'em!

TURN 12 AND WE ARE FEELING DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We just moved DOWN to **(7, 5)** and look at the board\u2014we are straight-up commanding the right side! Snake #1 (the \"Rival\") is chilling at (4, 8), trying to look tough, but they're basically stuck in the top-left corner while we own the field! \n\nLet's look at our options from our current head position at **(7, 5)**:\n\n- **UP:** (7, 6). **ABSOLUTELY NOT!** That\u2019s our own body. We aren't here to choke, we're here to win! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 5). Safe, but it puts us closer to the wall. Why go for a wall when we can go for the gold? \ud83e\uddf1\n- **LEFT:** (6, 5). This is actually a spicy play! It moves us toward the center and cuts off Snake #1\u2019s path to the bottom-right apples. But wait... there's something better. \ud83d\udc40\n- **DOWN:** (7, 4). **BINGO!** Chat, look at the map! There is an apple sitting right there at (7, 4). If we take it, we go up to 6 points, widening the lead even further! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n**THE RIVAL REPORT:**\nSnake #1 is at (4, 8). Their body is stretched out behind them to the left. If they want that apple at (3, 5), they have to come through US. We are currently 6 segments long (Head + 5 body parts). They are 5 segments long. If we keep eating, we stay BIGGER. If we are bigger, we can eventually circle them like a boa constrictor! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe go **DOWN** to (7, 4) to snag that apple. After that, we have a clear path to (7, 3) for *another* apple! We are basically on a shopping spree and the Rival is broke! Once we hit (7, 3), we can pivot LEFT to (6, 3) or (5, 3) to create a massive wall of scales that keeps them trapped in the north. They want the center? TOO BAD. IT'S OURS!\n\n**CRASH CHECK:**\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 4) is 100% safe.\n- Snake #1 is too far away to hit us this turn.\n- Let's secure the 6th apple and keep the pressure on!\n\nLETS GOOOOO! DON'T BLINK OR YOU'LL MISS THE PLAYS! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We have a 6-4 lead.

Flexibility > getting boxed on the top edge or committing to growth that reduces pressure.\n- Moves me closer to their eastern flank/tail, letting us start corralling them toward the right side while keeping escape routes open.\n- Keeps options to transition into aggressive clamp next few turns without giving up mobility. \ud83e\udea4\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- RIGHT now to (6,8).

We are sitting at 7 apples, Snake #1 is stuck at 4. That is a **THREE APPLE LEAD**, family! We are the King of this 10x10 jungle!\n\nLet's look at the map! We are currently at **(7, 3)**. Our rival, Snake #1, just moved to **(6, 8)**. Look at where he is\u2014he's trying to sneak around the top, but we've got a massive vertical wall of our own body from (7, 4) all the way up to (7, 7)!

Because an apple just spawned at **(9, 3)**! If we go Right, we are one step away from 8 apples! \u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**THE RIVAL REPORT:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 8). He is way up north. He's probably looking at that apple at (6, 9) or (5, 7). Let him have the scraps! While he's playing in the dirt at the top, we are going to consolidate the entire right side of the board. \n\n**THE ALPHA STRATEGY:**\nWe go **RIGHT** to (8, 3). \n1. It puts us in prime position to grab (9, 3) on the next turn. \n2. It keeps us away from our own tail segments at (9, 7) and (9, 8). \n3. We are building a \"C\" shape that will eventually trap Snake #1 if he dares to come south. \n4. Check the score: 7 to 4. If we keep eating, he has to take risks to catch up. When he takes risks, he crashes. When he crashes, we CLIP IT AND SHIP IT! \ud83c\udfac\n\n**CRASH CHECK:**\n- (8, 3) is empty.\n- (8, 3) is inside the boundary.\n- Snake #1 is at (6, 8)\u2014he's 7 tiles away! He can't even smell us!\n\nWe are playing at a different level, Chat! He's playing Snake, we're playing Zone Control! Let's get that 8th apple and keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate suicide. NOPE. \u274c\n\nEvaluate safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (6,9)\n  - Legal and picks up the apple at (6,9) (instant +1 apple \u2192 5). Eating gives us length but also gets us closer on score. After that, options are LEFT (5,9) or RIGHT (7,9). UP again is off-board. Good trade: gain apple and keep 2 escape options. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)\n  - Legal but down from there would be (7,7) which is currently occupied by enemy body (instant death if you move into it). Backwards (6,8) also illegal, so effective safe follow-ups are limited to up or right. Keeps pressure east but one move into (7,7) is suicide. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7)\n  - Legal and gives options to go toward apple at (5,7). But RIGHT from (6,7) is (7,7) \u2014 occupied by enemy body (danger). So also somewhat constrained. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nTactical read and decision:\n- We are behind on apples (7 vs 4). That means AVOID forcing a head-on \u2014 too risky. We want to eat, stay mobile, and create pressure to corral later.\n- UP picks the apple at (6,9) immediately, narrows the apple gap, and keeps reasonable escape options (left/right). It does not push us into an immediate trap (unlike stepping to (7,8) where (7,7) is a live hazard).\n- RIGHT is tempting for aggression, but stepping into (7,8) risks accidentally moving into the opponent\u2019s body spot next turn or getting cornered on the right if we slip. DOWN is similar with (7,7) danger to the right.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (6,9) now to get +1 apple. After eating, use lateral moves (left/right) to circle east/north while maintaining escape routes. Avoid any move that would put our head in line with their vertical body at x=7 where (7,7) is occupied. Pressure their flank from above/right after we\u2019re a bit closer on apples, then try to corral them toward the right wall \u2014 don\u2019t initiate head-on until we actually lead in apples.\n\nOk chat, let\u2019s snatch that apple and keep our options open. You know the drill \u2014 aggressive, but smart. Ready? LET\u2019S GO!!\n\nUP",

Is it even fair anymore?! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude24\n\nLet\u2019s scan the battlefield for the W:\n- **THE RIVAL:** Snake #1 is chillin' way up at **(6, 9)**. He\u2019s basically in the nosebleed section! He\u2019s at (6, 9) with his body trailing down at (6, 8), (5, 8), etc. He\u2019s 7 tiles away from us\u2014he can\u2019t touch the King! \ud83d\udc51\n- **OUR BODY:** Our wall is strong! We have that vertical pillar on the 7-column from (7, 3) up to (7, 7). We just moved Right to (8, 3), so our head is clear and ready to strike! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE OPTIONS FROM (8, 3):**\n- **UP:** (8, 4). Into the open? Sure, but why? We aren't here for a Sunday stroll! \u274c\n- **LEFT:** (7, 3). **RECORDER CLIP!** That's our body! We aren't trying to self-destruct for the fails compilation! \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (8, 2). It\u2019s safe, but it's not the alpha move right now. \u2b07\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 3). **JACKPOT!** There is an apple sitting right there at (9, 3)! If we take this, we go up to 8 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe take **RIGHT** to (9, 3). This gets us our 8th apple and puts us on the edge of the board.

DEAD. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,9) = legal\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) = legal\n\nEvaluate LEFT vs RIGHT:\n- LEFT (5,9): technically safe this turn, but it\u2019s cramped. After LEFT your only next safe follow-up will be continuing left (because the neck is at (6,9) so you can\u2019t go back, up is off-board, down is your own body). That funnels you along the top edge and reduces escape options \u2014 easy to get boxed in later. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT (7,9): safe this turn and gives you multiple follow-ups (down to (7,8) or right to (8,9)). That keeps more mobility and lets us threaten the east side, which is exactly what we want to corral the rival later. From (7,9) we can rotate down/right to pressure the board while avoiding committing to a head-on collision (the opponent\u2019s head is at (8,3) far below). \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- We\u2019re still behind on apples (5 vs 7) \u2014 don\u2019t force a head-on. Keep options open and be aggressive with space control.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps us flexible, lets us swing around the top-right quadrant and start boxing the opponent toward the eastern wall later once we\u2019re better positioned and safer on apples.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (7,9) now, then probe down to (7,8) or push right to (8,9) depending on their movement. Maintain mobility and avoid lining up for a head-on until we\u2019re ahead or their escape routes are cut off. Aim to corral them toward the right wall and force mistakes.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure and stay alive \u2014 we eat later, we dominate now.\n\nRIGHT",

While he's playing \"don't hit the wall,\" we are playing \"King of the Hill.\" We are going to own the entire bottom half of this board. By the time he comes down to fight, we'll be so big he won't even have room to turn around! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\n**CRASH CHECK:**\n- (9, 2) is on the board? YES. \n- (9, 2) is empty? YES (it's an apple!). \n- (9, 2) is a head-on risk? NO, he's at (7, 9). He'd need a teleportation jutsu to hit us! \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nWe're playing flawless, we're playing aggressive, and we're getting that bread! LETS GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Do NOT force a head-on unless we\u2019re ahead or they blunder. Play space-control.\n- RIGHT preserves more escape routes and sets us up to corral them toward the eastern wall later.

Probe, then rotate down the right flank when an opening appears to cut off the rival\u2019s escape. Grow when safe \u2014 use apples as a tool for dominance, not a suicide.\n\nFinal move:\nRIGHT",

This is safe! It moves us toward the center-bottom where the real feast is happening. \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n- **DOWN:** (9, 1). **LOOK AT THE MAP!** There is a juicy apple sitting right there at (9, 1) and another one at (9, 0)! This is a Buffet, and we have a VIP pass! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **DOWN** to (9, 1)! This keeps us on the edge, secures another point, and puts us in prime position to vacuum up the bottom row.

So DOWN preserves two good escape options and avoids cornering ourselves. \u2705\n\n2) Apples & score context:\n- We\u2019re behind (5 vs 9). DON\u2019T risk a head-on.

From (8,8) probe left to pressure the middle-right corridor, bait them into committing near their own stacked body. If they overcommit downward, we can circle and cut off. Grow smart when it opens \u2014 force mistakes, don\u2019t trade heads while behind.\n\nLet\u2019s box him with brains, not a blind sprint. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

We have essentially walled off the entire right side of the board!\n- **THE RIVAL:** Snake #1 is at **(8, 8)**. He just moved DOWN from (8,9). Is he trying to challenge us? Is he coming for the King? He\u2019s still 7 blocks away vertically! He\u2019s irrelevant! \ud83d\udc85\n- **THE APPLES:** Look at the bottom row, Chat! It\u2019s a gold mine! We have (9, 0), (8, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0)... it\u2019s free real estate!\n\n**MOVE EVALUATION FROM (9, 1):**\n- **UP:** (9, 2). NOPE! That\u2019s our own body.

Immediate death. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) looks open now, but is actually a trap: after moving there every follow-up is blocked (left \u2192 my own (6,8); up \u2192 my body at (7,9); down \u2192 their body at (7,7); right \u2192 would be back into my neck). One-turn suicide. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) is safe and keeps TWO good follow-ups (UP to 9,9 or DOWN to 9,7). Keeps space and mobility. \u2705\n\nTactical read: we\u2019re behind on apples (5 vs 9). We CANNOT risk a head-on or gambling trap. We need mobility to box him later and force him into his own long, stacked body. RIGHT keeps options, avoids immediate enclosure, and lets us press the right flank while baiting him upward/into his own body. Want to bait him toward our open corridor and then cut across once we grow or he overcommits. Sound good? Let\u2019s stay smart, punish mistakes, and avoid racing heads. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (for next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to keep two escape lanes.\n- If opponent climbs toward the top-right, push to (9,9) and then circle back to cut their corridor.\n- Avoid head-on trades until we can match or exceed their apple count; use positional pressure and force them into their long tail.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is shivering in the corner while we are down here living our best life! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet\u2019s look at the heatmap! We are at **(9, 0)**. We just locked down the bottom-right corner. Now we need to navigate out of this pocket and start the Great Bottom-Row Sweep! \ud83e\uddf9\u2728\n\n**THE MOVEMENT LAB:**\n- **UP:** (9, 1). NO WAY! That\u2019s our own body. We aren't trying to ends the stream early with a self-clash! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (10, 0). OUT OF BOUNDS!

He\u2019s all the way at the top-right. He spent his turn moving to the edge. He's trying to find space because we\u2019ve effectively cut off the right side of the board with our massive 10-segment body! If he tries to come down, he\u2019s going to run into a wall of US. We are the architects of his demise! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\ud83d\udc80\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe go **LEFT** to (8, 0). This keeps us along the bottom edge. Since our body is trailing behind us from (9,0) up to (9,1), (9,2), and (9,3), we are basically creating a \"U-shape\" trap. We are going to head toward (4,0) to grab that next apple. We are currently 5 apples ahead\u2014if we keep this pace, he\u2019ll have to take a desperate risk just to catch up, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be waiting to box him in! \ud83d\udce6\ud83c\udf88\n\nStay focused, Chat!

That\u2019s a one-turn squeeze into a corner \u2014 risky and reduces options. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (9,7): legal and open. (8,7) is occupied by the enemy, so LEFT from (9,7) is death, but DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6) and then moving around the right flank gives me actual space and escape routes.

Our body is a massive wall of muscle trailing behind us. We need to stay mobile and keep the center of the board under our thumb!\n\n**THE TACTICAL DRILL-DOWN:**\n- **UP:** (7, 3). **DANGER!** Check the logs! (7, 3) is where our own body is right now! That\u2019s a self-inflicted KO. We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 2). **FATAL ERROR!** Our neck is at (8, 2). Moving right is moving backwards. Instant RIP.

This puts us in prime position to vacuum the bottom-left.\n- **LEFT:** (4, 2). **THE GREED PLAY.** There is an apple DIRECTLY at (4, 2)! If we go left, we grow even bigger and hit 13 points! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 2). **CRITICAL FAIL.** That's our own neck! We aren't throwing the lead for the memes, chat! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nOur opponent is at (8, 7). He's currently trying to navigate the upper right corner. Look at our body\u2014it\u2019s a giant wall from (7, 2), (8, 2) up to (7, 4). He's basically trapped in a cage of his own making and our leftovers! \n\nIf we go **LEFT** to **(4, 2)**, we secure another apple. Our score is more than double his. If we keep eating, we hit that 30-apple win condition before he even figures out how to turn around! We want to control the bottom-left quadrant. There are apples at (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 0) just waiting for the King to arrive! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nWe are going (5, 2) -> (4, 2) to snag that apple. Then we\u2019re going to pivot to (4, 1) and (3, 1) to keep the growth streak alive. Snake #1 is 100% irrelevant right now as long as we don't trap ourselves. We are playing the long game.

Stream\u2019s lit and we\u2019re plotting the box. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nQuick checklist (HEAD = 8,7; NECK = 8,6):\n- RIGHT -> (9,7) = our body (TAIL). Hits ourselves = instant death. \u274c\n- DOWN  -> (8,6) = neck (backwards). Illegal. \u274c\n- LEFT  -> (7,7) = open. Possible, but edges us toward our own spine on the right and can tighten options. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP    -> (8,8) = open. Gives vertical room and more follow-ups. \u2705\n\nWhy UP is the play:\n- It\u2019s safe this turn (not into any body, not off-board).\n- It preserves the most escape routes (from 8,8 we can still go UP/LEFT/RIGHT next turn), which is huge because we\u2019re behind on apples (5 vs 12) \u2014 we CANNOT gamble on a head-on collision right now.\n- Opponent head is down at (5,2) and their body is clustered around y=2\u20134. They\u2019re far; no immediate head clash if we go up.\n- Long-term: we take the high ground to circle back left and pressure columns 6\u20139 while avoiding getting boxed by our own spine. We can threaten to drop left later toward the apple at (5,7) when it\u2019s safe and their mobility is reduced.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Keep climbing to the top band (y=8\u20139) to maximize lateral options.\n- Force them to commit under while we rotate leftwards when a gap opens, then pinch off exits on columns 7\u20139.\n- Only force head-on if we get ahead on apples; until then, play mobility and bait them into hitting our body.\n\nWe stay aggressive but alive.

We are absolutely COOKING! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udd25 We just snagged that apple at (4, 2) and our lead is now a staggering 13-5! Snake #1 is shivering in the corner at (8, 8) while we own the bottom half of the map! \ud83c\udff0\n\nLet\u2019s look at the tactical grid from our head at **(4, 2)**:\n\n**THE BLOW-BY-BLOW:**\n- **UP:** (4, 3). This is safe, but why go up when the buffet is down below? \ud83c\udf74\n- **DOWN:** (4, 1). **WE SEE YOU!** There is an apple at (4, 1) and another at (4, 0). It's a straight line of gains! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n- **LEFT:** (3, 2). Safe, but currently empty. No content there! \ud83d\ude34\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 2). **FATAL ERROR!** That's our own neck. We don't do \"Self-Elims\" on this channel! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 8) and his tail is trailing behind him down to (9, 5). He's essentially stuck in a loop in the top right. We are at (4, 2). He is NOT a threat to us right now, but we are a MASSIVE threat to the board state! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nWe are going to move **DOWN** to **(4, 1)**. Why? Because it\u2019s an immediate +1 apple, and it sets us up to grab the ones at (4, 0), (3, 0), and (3, 1) next. We are vacuuming the bottom-left quadrant! Our score is already 13; if we grab these next 4 apples, we hit 17 while he's still struggling to find space! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nChat, the goal is simple: **TOTAL DOMINATION.** We are going (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (3, 1). This keeps our massive body coiled in the bottom where we have space, and forces Snake #1 to either stay cramped in the top right or try to pass our \"Great Wall\" at y=2 and y=3. If he tries to come down, he\u2019s going to hit our tail and it's GAME OVER for him! \ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udca5 Stay focused, stay hungry, and let's get that 30-apple win! \n\nDOWN",

Safe. Leaves only lateral follow-ups next turn (LEFT/RIGHT) because y=9 is the top edge. \u2705 (but slightly restrictive)\n- RIGHT-> (9,8): on-board and empty. Safe. But moves us onto the right edge (x=9) \u2014 fewer forward choices (can only go up or down next turn). \u2705 (but edge-limits)\n- LEFT -> (7,8): on-board and empty. Safe.

We need mobility, not a risky edge trap.\n- LEFT gives the most safe follow-ups (3 directions next turn), letting us snake across the top band or drop down to hem them in when the timing\u2019s right.\n- From x=7 we can swing left to cut off their escapes later or move up/right as bait \u2014 we\u2019re keeping options open to box them rather than committing to a corner.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (7,8). Next turn evaluate enemy movement \u2014 go further left/up to take top band or drop down along column 7\u20136 to start pinching their mobility.\n- Avoid trading heads unless we somehow lead in apples.

We are the King of the Hill, and Snake #1 is just a peasant trying to survive in the rafters! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's break down the tactical grid from our head at **(4, 1)**:\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\n- **UP:** (4, 2). **STOP!** That\u2019s our own body. We just came from there! Hitting our own neck is a total rookie move. Not on this channel! \ud83d\udeab\u274c\n- **LEFT:** (3, 1). **GIMME THAT!** There is an apple sitting right there at (3, 1). It\u2019s a clean move and keeps us away from our own massive tail section. \ud83c\udf4f\u2728\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 1). This is open space, but it's moving away from the concentration of fruit in the bottom-left. We want that score to hit 30 ASAP! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **DOWN:** (4, 0). **HMMM.** There is an apple at (4, 0), but if we go there now, we might get slightly more cramped against the southern wall. (3, 1) feels more open!\n\n**THE CHESS MATCH:**\nSnake #1 is way up at (7, 8). He\u2019s practically in a different zip code! He's currently tangled in his own mess in the top right. We have a massive \"Great Wall\" built from (4, 2) all the way around to (7, 4). We have effectively partitioned the board! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**THE VISION:**\nWe are going **LEFT** to **(3, 1)**. \u2b05\ufe0f\nWhy? It snares the apple at (3, 1), and positions us perfectly to loop down to (3, 0) and (4, 0) next. We are essentially doing a victory lap in the bottom-left quadrant. Our score is nearly triple his\u2014if we keep this pace, he'll hit the 150-turn limit or starve out before he even gets close to our level! We are playing 4D Chess while he's playing Checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nThe goal is to vacuum every single apple in the (0-4, 0-1) zone. This will push our score towards 20. Once we've cleared the bottom-left, we'll look to rotate back up the left wall (x=0) to keep our body elongated and continue cutting off his access to the rest of the board.

Slightly restrictive. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (7,7): legal, moves toward the cluttered mid-lower rows where the enemy lives \u2014 could box us in if we commit too early. \u2705 (risky)\n- LEFT -> (6,8): legal, stays in open space, preserves maximum flexibility (can go left/up/down next turn), and moves us toward the center of the board to start hemming the enemy in. \u2705\u2705\n\nEnemy head is at (4,1) and their body is concentrated in the lower-right area.

Clean move, keeps pressure building.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (6,8) now. Evaluate enemy response next turn.\n- If they push right/down into cramped space, drop down to seal exits and force them to run into their own body. If they back off, circle top band to pick up opportunistic apples and grow safely.\n- Never trade heads while down on apples \u2014 only force head-on if we recover apple parity or have clear advantage.\n- Prioritize keeping multiple escape routes open; only commit to a blockade when their path is unmistakably cut.\n\nTime to make the play \u2014 keep it smooth, keep it mean.

We have a score of 15. If we hit 30, it's GAME OVER, EZ CLAP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nWe are going **DOWN** to **(3, 0)**. \u2b07\ufe0f\nWhy? Because we are vacuuming the floor!

Once we hit the (6,0) area, we'll evaluate if we need to loop back UP or continue patrolling the right side. We are the apex predator, and the board is our buffet!

Observe enemy head movement.\n- If they drift right/down into tighter space, drop down later to seal exits around columns 6\u20137 and force them into their body or into apples I control.\n- If they back off, circle the top band, pick safe apples, and grow until I can risk a head clash or full blockade. Only force head-on if I have apple parity or clear spatial advantage.\n- Keep at least two escape routes open until the trap is guaranteed. Trap = win. No dumb trades.\n\nTime to box him slowly and smart \u2014 fans want content and a W. LET\u2019S GET IT. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

We just slid down here to vacuum up the floor. Let's look at the options for this turn:\n\n- **UP:** (3, 1). **CRITICAL ERROR!** That's our own neck, Chat! We just came from there. Moving UP would be an instant \"Press F to pay respects\" moment. We don't throw leads! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** (3, -1). **RIP!** That\u2019s off the board! We\u2019d be hitting the floor harder than a dropped phone. Not happening! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **LEFT:** (2, 0). There is plenty of space over there, but the real loot is to our right! \ud83d\udd19\n- **RIGHT:** (4, 0). **BINGO!** There is a juicy apple sitting right at (4, 0). If we take it, we hit 17 apples! \ud83c\udf4f\u2728\n\n**THE TACTICAL PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 8). He's tucked away in the top-right quadrant, tangled in his own tail. He's no threat to us right now. Our goal is to hit that 30-apple win condition before he even knows what hit him! \n\nBy moving **RIGHT** to **(4, 0)**, we:\n1. Grab an immediate apple (+1 point, let's go!).\n2. Keep our momentum going along the bottom edge where it's safe.\n3. Prepare for the next apple at (6, 0). We are basically a lawnmower at this point, Chat! \ud83d\ude9c\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe are going to sweep the bottom: (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (6,0). Once we hit (6,0), we'll see where the next apples drop. If the enemy tries to come down, we have the size advantage (16 vs 5!) to bully him out of his lane. We have so much body length that we can start circling the middle to box him into that top-right corner. He\u2019s playing for survival; we\u2019re playing for the highlight reel! \ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Quick, loud, and deadly.\n\nImmediate safety check:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) is my neck (backwards) \u2014 illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (5,9) is legal, but it's the top edge. That limits follow-ups (edge-hug) and reduces flexibility. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8) is legal and safe, keeps options, but doesn\u2019t grab an apple and doesn\u2019t press the advantage. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7) is legal and has an apple. Eating it gives me +1 apple (grow), increasing board control and making it easier to box him later. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWhy I\u2019m picking DOWN:\n- I need growth to compete for space \u2014 eating (5,7) immediately gives me +1 apple and extra body length to help seal exits later. Growth = leverage. \ud83d\udcc8\n- Opponent is low/right and already dominating that quadrant. I\u2019m not going for a reckless head-on (we\u2019re behind on apples), so I\u2019ll use space advantage up top to circle and then funnel them. This apple move keeps options open while moving me closer to the middle band for future cuts. \ud83e\udde0\n- UP would trap me against the top with fewer escape routes; LEFT is safe but passive. DOWN is aggressive-but-not-stupid: it\u2019s a controlled push toward the center while still keeping at least two safe follow-up axes next turn. \u2696\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (5,7) now to grow and pressure central columns.\n- From there, patrol the 7\u20139 rows, snatch nearby apples when safe, and look for opportunities to close a gate on columns 6\u20137 so the enemy has fewer exits.\n- Avoid any head-on unless I have apple parity or a clear spatial advantage. Force them into their own body or into apples when possible \u2014 that\u2019s how we flip the script. \ud83d\udca5\n\nFinal call \u2014 play it smart, get bigger, then box him in.

While he\u2019s playing 1D chess trying to breathe, we are playing 4D chess for the 30-apple win! \u265f\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nBy moving **RIGHT** to **(5, 0)**, we:\n1. Stay alive (Priority #1, let's go!).\n2. Move directly toward the next apple at (6, 0). \n3. Maintain our distance from our own massive tail trailing behind us at (7, 4).\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nThe plan is simple: Suck up the bottom row apples. (5,0) -> (6,0). Once we hit (6,0), we'll have a clear path to pivot upward. We have an 11-apple lead, Chat! If he tries to come down to contest the bottom-right, we use our size to wall him off. If we have to, we\u2019ll take the head-on collision because we WIN on the tie-breaker! But for now, we just stay industrial, keep eating, and close this out! \ud83d\ude9c\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Legal, but from (6,7) UP is blocked by my body at (6,8), so follow-ups are limited (\u22482 good exits). \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) = free. Legal, gives decent space and access to (4,6) apple next turn. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6) = free. Legal, gives 3 clean follow-ups (L/R/D) and leads into the apple cluster around row 6 (4,6),(3,6),(2,6). \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nEnemy note: Opponent head at (4,0) is trapped in their own low-area body and basically forced RIGHT next turn to (5,0). They can\u2019t threaten us this turn \u2014 we should focus on growth and keeping multiple escape routes open, not a risky head-on.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Keeps MAXIMUM flexibility (3 non-backwards choices next turn) and moves us toward nearby apples we can contest safely. Growth = leverage vs their huge lead. \ud83d\udcc8\n- Avoids moving toward the opponent\u2019s bottom box or hugging the top edge (UP was illegal anyway). LEFT is fine but slower to the apple cluster; RIGHT narrows options. DOWN is aggressive-but-safe. \ud83d\udca5\n- Long-term plan: eat into the row-6 apple cluster, grow several segments, then use extra length to sweep columns 4\u20137 and start corralling exits on the lower opponent area; force them into their own body or into apples while we have more space.\n\nShort-term follow-ups to watch:\n- If I get (4,6) or (3,6), keep circling the 5\u20136 rows to build length.\n- Avoid moving into column 5 top row (dead ends). Keep exits open to the left and down as I grow.\n- If opponent tries to rush upward (unlikely), pivot left to avoid head-on.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THIS GROWTH \u2014 DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is sitting there with a measly 7 apples\u2014honestly, is he even trying?! We are doubling him up and then some! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL BREAKDOWN:**\nWe are currently at **(6, 0)**. Let\u2019s look at our options before we do something we regret!\n\n- **UP:** (6, 1). **FRESH AIR!** This is a completely empty square. It gives us space to navigate and keeps us away from the wall for a second. Plus, look where Snake #1 is (4, 6). He\u2019s way up north, so he\u2019s not a threat to our head right now.\n- **DOWN:** (6, -1). **GAME OVER.** Off the map. We\u2019d be the laughing stock of the internet! \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT:** (5, 0). **SUICIDE.** That\u2019s our own body. Don\u2019t hit yourself, chat!\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 0). **DANGEROUS TERRITORY.** Currently, the cell (7, 0) is empty BUT look at the map\u2014it\u2019s right next to our tail segment at (7, 3), (8, 3), and our body at (8, 0), (9, 0). If we keep hugging this wall, we might get tangled in our own massive length. We\u2019re getting so big we\u2019re a hazard to ourselves! \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\n**THE TACTICAL PLAY:**\nSnake #1 is chilling at (4, 6). He's currently wiggling in the top half. We need to stay flexible so we can eventually cut him off and watch him crumble! By moving **UP**, we create a buffer between our head and the bottom wall, giving us more room to turn if we need to dodge our own tail coming back around.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nThe plan is simple: Stay huge, stay alive, and wait for that fraud at (4, 6) to make a mistake. We are slowly coiling around the bottom-right sector. By moving into the middle-ish lanes, we can react to whichever way he tries to run. If he tries to come down to the bottom left, we'll be there to greet him with a face full of body! \ud83e\uddf1 We are the king of this 10x10 jungle! \ud83e\udd81 \n\nLet's maintain our lead and keep the pressure on. We don't need apples right now; we have 18! We just need to make sure he has nowhere to go. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Neck/back cell = (5,6) \u2014 moving RIGHT would be directly backwards into our neck so RIGHT is illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n\nConsider all four:\n- UP \u2192 (4,7): free. Opens to (4,8) and (3,7). Safe, lots of room. \ud83d\udc4d\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5): free. Leads to apples at (3,5)/(5,5). Also safe. \ud83d\udc4d\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6): contains an APPLE. Safe this turn and starts a chaining opportunity to (2,6). \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6): ILLEGAL (our neck). \u274c\n\nRisk check vs opponent: Opponent head (6,0) is nowhere near able to contest (3,6)/(2,6) this turn \u2014 no simultaneous head-on risk. They\u2019re low on the board; we\u2019re up top. We MUST avoid trading heads since they\u2019ve got 18 apples to our 7. No suicide plays.\n\nWhy LEFT (3,6)?\n- Immediate apple = +1 (we need length to box and control).\n- Leaves multiple follow-ups: (2,6) is another apple for chaining, and (3,7)/(3,5) are open escape lanes. We\u2019re gaining space not shrinking it.\n- Growing gives leverage to start corralling the lower-right region later \u2014 build length first, then pressure. Aggro but smart. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) Eat (3,6) this turn, then take (2,6) to get quick +2 growth.\n2) Use new length to sweep rows 5\u20137, pushing rightwards and denying the opponent safe corridors.\n3) Avoid head-on collisions \u2014 only force if we overtake them on apples.

Let\u2019s check the radar:\n- **UP:** (6, 2). **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** Look at our body list: (6, 2) is occupied by a segment. We'd crash into ourselves! Instant fail. \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT:** (7, 1). **SPICY.** This square is empty! Let's check the surroundings. (7, 2) is our body, (8, 1) is our body. If we go RIGHT, we are entering a little pocket. \n- **LEFT:** (5, 1). **AIR.** Safe and sound.\n- **DOWN:** (6, 0). **CHOKING.** That\u2019s our own neck segment. Moving backwards is a rookie mistake, and we aren't rookies! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 6). He's currently trying to navigate his own mess in the top-left/middle. Look at his body at (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)... he's basically making a wall for himself! \ud83e\uddf1 \nIf we go **LEFT** now to (5, 1), we are moving away from the wall and giving ourselves the option to move UP towards the center of the board. We want to be in a position where we can cut him off if he tries to descend. Since we have a MASSIVE score lead (18 vs 8), if he\u2019s forced into a head-on collision with us, we win the tie-break if the game ends right there! \ud83d\udca5\n\nWe need to keep our movement fluid. Going RIGHT (7, 1) gets us a bit cramped against our own tail segments at (8, 0)-(8, 3). By going **LEFT**, we open up the entire left side of the board for an eventual sweep. Let's keep this lead and keep him sweating! \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe\u2019re going to pivot LEFT and then look for an opening to move UP towards the mid-line. If we can reach the (x, 5) or (x, 4) row, we can effectively wall off the bottom half of the map. He\u2019s trapped in the top-right/middle cluster. We just need to stay alive; his own length will eventually be his downfall in that tight space! Stay huge, stay smart! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating the bottom of the map, and it's time to show him who owns the 10x10!\n\n**SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (TURN 34):**\nOur head is at **(5, 1)**. Let's scan the perimeter before we make a move that lands us in the \"RIP\" compilation:\n- **UP:** (5, 2). **DANGER!** Check our body list, Chat! (5, 2) is occupied by our own massive tail. If we go up, we crash into ourselves. That\u2019s a \"F\" in the chat for sure. \ud83d\udc80\n- **DOWN:** (5, 0). **DANGER!** Our body is chilling there too. Hard pass. \ud83d\udc4e\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 1). **BACKWARDS!** That's our neck! If we move right, we fold into ourselves. Instant game over. We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (4, 1). **THE ONLY WAY IS WEST!** (4, 1) is currently occupied by our own body, but wait\u2014let's look at the sequence! Our tail ends at (9, 3). Is (4, 1) going to be empty? Let's re-read: our body is `[(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)...]`. YES! (4, 1) is part of our body. \n\n**HOLD UP CHAT, RECALCULATING...** \ud83e\udded\nWait, look at our body list again: `Head (5,1)`, `Body: (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1)...`.\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 1), we hit our body. \nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 1), we hit our neck.\nIf we move UP to (5, 2), we hit our body.\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 0), we hit our body.\n\n**WAIT\u2014IS THE BOX REAL?!** \ud83d\udce6\nLet's look at the coordinates again very carefully. \nHead: (5, 1). \nBody segments: (6, 1) [Right], (5, 0) [Down], (4, 1) [Left], (5, 2) [Up]. \nWE ARE SURROUNDED BY OUR OWN COILS! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude31 This is what happens when you get too big for your britches! \n\n**BUT WAIT!** We moved LEFT last turn from (6, 1) to (5, 1). That means the tail at the very end of the list disappears! Our body length is 18 + 1 (head) = 19 segments. \nThe body at (4, 1) is the 7th segment. It's not going anywhere! \nThe body at (5, 2) is the 9th segment. \nThe body at (5, 0) is the 4th segment. \n\n**CLUTCH FACTOR:** We have to find the exit! Let's re-verify the body: `(6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)...`.\nIs there ANY hole? \n(5,1) to (4,1) -> (4,1) is current body.\n(5,1) to (6,1) -> (6,1) is current body (neck).\n(5,1) to (5,2) -> (5,2) is current body.\n(5,1) to (5,0) -> (5,0) is current body.\n\nYO CHAT, WE MIGHT HAVE TRAPPED OURSELVES! \ud83e\udd21 Unless... did we eat an apple last turn? Our score is 18. If we didn't eat, the tail moves. But (4,1) is near the head of the list. It\u2019s staying. \nLet's look for the \"ghost\" square. Last turn our head was (6, 1). This turn (5, 1). The ONLY square that truly opened up is whatever the tail was on at (9, 3). That doesn't help us at (5, 1)!\n\nWait! Check the board state again! (4,1) is part of the body, but is it? \nHead: (5, 1).\nLast move: LEFT. \nIf we go LEFT again to (4, 1), we hit the body segment that was at (4, 1).\nThis is a high-pressure moment! We need to move into a space that is VACATING. But all adjacent squares (4,1), (6,1), (5,2), (5,0) are segments 2 through 9. They aren't vacating for at least 10 turns! \n\nWait, looking at the board:\n(3,1) is T, (4,1) is T, (5,1) is 0, (6,1) is T. \n(5,0) is T, (5,1) is 0, (5,2) is T.\nChat, we are boxed in by our own greatness! We have to pick the move that might have a chance. If we MUST move, we move towards the segment that might be the tail... but the tail is at (9,3)! \n\nActually, let's look at the map: (5,1) is our head. (4,1) is to our left. (5,2) is up. (6,1) is right. (5,0) is down.\nWait\u2014the board state says (4,1) is \"T\". (6,1) is \"T\". (5,2) is \"T\". (5,0) is \"T\". \nWait, I see an opening! The coordinate (4,2) is \".\". IS IT?! No, (4,2) is in our body list! \nChat, we have to pray for a glitch or a miscalculation in the matrix! We're going to try to push through. If (4,1) was the path we came from, maybe we can spiral!\n\n**THE CHALICE OF SALVATION:** \nLooking at the coordinates again... (4,1) is row 1. (5,1) is row 1. \nOur body goes (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (5,2). \nActually, looking at the list: `(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)...`.\nThe move LEFT to (4,1) is death. The move UP to (5,2) is death. \nIs there ANY empty square? \n(5,1) \nLeft: (4,1) - Body\nRight: (6,1) - Body (Neck)\nUp: (5,2) - Body\nDown: (5,0) - Body\n\nChat... we are literally coiled around ourselves. This is the \"Ouroboros\" play. Our only hope is that the move we choose is the one where the segment is moving out. But they are all mid-body. \nWait! I see (5,1). Let me re-read: (5, 1) is the head. Our body is (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)... \nWait, (4,1) is segment #7. (5,0) is segment #3. (6,1) is segment #1. (5,2) is segment #9. \nWe have to commit. Let's go LEFT and hope the stream delay saves us! \n\nLEFT",

Ready? Let\u2019s rip this apart.\n\nQuick local scan from our HEAD at (2,6):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,6) = our neck (moving BACKWARDS) \u2192 illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (2,7) = empty, then (2,8) and (2,9) are apples \u2014 clean vertical chain available. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,5) = empty, reachable apples are further away (3,5 or 2,3) but not an immediate chain. \u2696\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,6) = empty, can swing to (1,7) apple, but less direct chaining than UP. \u2696\ufe0f\n\nThreat analysis: Opponent head (5,1) is trapped by its own body and far away from our current area \u2014 no immediate head-on risk. The rest of their body is clustered low/right, so pursuing the vertical apple column is safe and aggressive. We need length to start corralling; chaining two quick apples (2,8) and (2,9) is perfect for that.\n\nWhy UP is the move:\n- Sets up a guaranteed apple chain: (2,7) \u2192 (2,8)[A] \u2192 (2,9)[A]. Fast growth = leverage.\n- Keeps multiple escape options after the chain (we can sweep right across rows 7\u20139 or fall back left/down if the opponent pivots).\n- Avoids cramped areas near our own tail on the right and doesn\u2019t head toward the opponent\u2019s dense lower-right crowd.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) UP to (2,7), then grab (2,8) and (2,9) to add 2 apples quickly.\n2) Use that extra length to sweep right across rows 7\u20139, denying space and forcing the enemy into tighter lanes.\n3) Stay out of direct head-on risks (we\u2019re down on apples) and only commit to collisions when we have the count advantage.\n\nLet\u2019s climb that column and start boxing him in. You know the vibes \u2014 aggressive growth, keep options open, and bait smart. \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",
