Apples are scattered but we ignore them for now \u2014 focus on the enemy!  \n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:  \n- **UP** \u2192 (3,5). Empty? Yes. In bounds? Yes. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3). Empty? Yes. In bounds? Yes. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4). Empty? Yes. In bounds? Yes. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4). Empty? Yes. In bounds? Yes. Safe.  \n\nAll moves safe right now \u2014 but we gotta think about what the enemy might do. Enemy at (8,9) \u2014 they could go DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), or RIGHT? Right is (9,9) \u2014 in bounds. UP is (8,10) \u2192 off board, so they won't go UP.  \n\nWe want to be aggressive, but also not walk into a head-on collision. Right now we're far apart, so no risk of same-cell collision this turn.  \n\nLong-term plan: Enemy is in the top-right corner. I'm near the middle-left. I should start moving toward them to pressure, but also control center board. If I go UP or RIGHT, I move toward center/top-right. If I go LEFT or DOWN, I move toward edges \u2014 risk getting pinned later.  \n\nActually, let's think: Going UP to (3,5) keeps me central with more options next turn. Going RIGHT to (4,4) also fine. But going LEFT to (2,4) or DOWN to (3,3) pushes me toward bottom-left \u2014 less threatening.  \n\nWe want to dominate the board, so move toward enemy while keeping escape routes. UP feels good \u2014 opens future moves in all directions except maybe down next turn if my body grows.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 apples? Ignore apples, but still, moving toward apples can help us grow to have longer body for defense. Closest apple to me is at (3,6) \u2014 that's UP twice. So UP gets me closer to that apple safely.  \n\nEnemy's closest apple is at (9,7) \u2014 they might go DOWN/LEFT toward it.  \n\nI think: Go UP this turn, next turn reassess. If enemy moves toward me, we can try to cut off their space.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (3,5), check enemy position. If they moved toward center, consider moving RIGHT/UP to flank. If they stayed top-right, keep moving toward apples while boxing them into corner.  \n\nAlright chat, let's make the move \u2014 UP!  \n\nUP",

All four directions are currently safe, but which one fuels our aggression and keeps us flexible?  \n\n**Rhetorical questions:**  \n- Should I chase the apple swamp down south or risk heading right into empty space?  \n- Will moving up trap me in a corner with fewer escape routes?  \n- Is heading left a smart way to stay central or just a wasted slide?  \n\n**Risk check:**  \n- UP \u2192 (8,9) is off\u2011apple, but opens a narrow hallway near the top\u2011right edge.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) is a dead\u2011end for apples; we'd need to double\u2011back later.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) stays mid\u2011board but doesn't bring us closer to the cluster of apples at y\u22482\u20113.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) drops us straight into the apple\u2011dense lower zone (think (8,2), (8,1), (9,0) etc.) while still leaving multiple exit paths (left, right, down again).  \n\n**Strategic plan:**  \n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\u202fHead down to (8,7) to start gobbling those low\u2011lying apples, keep the board wide open, and force the rival to chase us from the opposite side.

Apples everywhere but we IGNORE 'em for now \u2014 focus on the ENEMY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, check all moves for instant death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,6). In bounds? Yes. Any snake body there? No. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about what the enemy might do THIS TURN! They're at (8,8). Their possible moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8). All in bounds, all empty.\n\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE and start boxing them into that top-right corner! If we move toward them, we cut off their escape. But we also don't want a head-on collision right now \u2014 we have equal length (0 apples), so head-on would be double KO. Not good.\n\nSo, which direction gets us closer to them? From (3,5) to (8,8): difference is +5 in x, +3 in y. So moving RIGHT gets us closer in x, moving UP gets us closer in y. Hmm.\n\nBut also, we need to think about future options \u2014 moving toward the center gives more flexibility. If I go UP to (3,6), I'm closer to that apple at (3,7) maybe later, but more importantly, I'm moving toward the top half where the enemy is. If I go RIGHT to (4,5), I'm moving toward the center-right.\n\nActually, let's think about the board edges \u2014 enemy is near the top and right edges. If we can approach from the LEFT or BELOW, we can push them into the wall! So moving UP or RIGHT helps with that.\n\nWhat about DOWN or LEFT? That moves us away from the enemy, giving them more space \u2014 BAD. We want to pressure! So eliminate DOWN and LEFT for now.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT: UP puts us at (3,6). Next turn, we could go RIGHT toward enemy or continue UP toward apples. RIGHT puts us at (4,5), then next turn UP or RIGHT again.\n\nWhich one sets up a better \"cut-off\" path? The enemy might move DOWN/LEFT toward center/apples. If they go DOWN to (8,7), and we go UP to (3,6), we're still far. If we go RIGHT to (4,5), we're still far but more central.\n\nHmm... I think UP is slightly better because:\n1. It moves us toward the top where enemy is.\n2. It keeps our x-position more left, which might allow us to later shift right and block their descent.\n3. There's an apple at (3,7) above us \u2014 if we grow, our body will be behind us, which could help block.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if we go UP, and enemy goes DOWN, they're moving toward center. That's fine \u2014 we can intercept next turn.\n\nActually, let's check: If enemy goes DOWN to (8,7), and we go UP to (3,6), distance changes from 5,3 to 5,2 \u2014 we get closer in y but same in x. If we go RIGHT to (4,5), and enemy goes DOWN to (8,7), distance changes to 4,2 \u2014 we get closer in both! So RIGHT might actually close distance faster.\n\nBut do we want to close distance fast? With equal length, we want to avoid head-on. So maybe keep a medium distance while we grow first? But the instructions say: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" We have equal score (0), so avoid head-on for now.\n\nSo maybe RIGHT is more aggressive in positioning, but UP is safer and sets up for future growth.\n\nYou know what, chat? Let's go RIGHT! Get closer to the center, cut off the enemy's path to the left side of the board. Next turn, we can go UP or RIGHT again depending on enemy move.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (4,5), check where enemy moved. If they moved DOWN/LEFT, consider continuing RIGHT or UP to intercept. If they stayed put or moved UP, maybe go UP to pressure. Avoid moving into their possible path until we have a length advantage.\n\nAlright, final decision \u2014 let's move RIGHT and start dominating the board! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let\u2019s break this down! \ud83d\ude24 Turn 2, we\u2019re at (4,5), enemy at (8,7). Still no bodies, so no instant death from that yet. Apples everywhere but we\u2019re IGNORING \u2018em \u2014 focus on the ENEMY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,6). In bounds? Yes. Any snake body there? No. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,4). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four are safe right now. But we gotta think about what the enemy might do THIS TURN! They\u2019re at (8,7). Their possible moves: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). All in bounds, all empty.\n\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE and start boxing them into the top-right corner! Our current position (4,5) vs enemy (8,7) \u2014 difference is +4 in x, +2 in y. So moving RIGHT closes x gap, moving UP closes y gap.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 if we move RIGHT to (5,5), we\u2019re moving toward the center-right, which could cut off their escape to the left side of the board. If we move UP to (4,6), we\u2019re moving toward the top, but still far left.\n\nWe also need to think about head-on collision risk \u2014 still equal length (0 apples), so head-on = double KO. Not good yet. So we want to close distance but NOT land on the same cell as them this turn.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate enemy likely moves: They might move DOWN/LEFT toward apples or center. If they go DOWN to (8,6), and we go RIGHT to (5,5), distance becomes (3,1) \u2014 getting close! If we go UP to (4,6), distance becomes (4,0) \u2014 even closer in y but still 4 in x.\n\nHmm\u2026 Actually, if they go DOWN to (8,6) and we go UP to (4,6), we\u2019d be on the same y-level \u2014 that could set up a horizontal chase. But if they go LEFT to (7,7) and we go RIGHT to (5,5), distance is (2,2) \u2014 still safe.\n\nWe also gotta think about future safe moves after this turn \u2014 moving RIGHT puts us at (5,5), which still has UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT all open. Moving UP to (4,6) also keeps all options open. So both are flexible.\n\nBut chat, remember the plan \u2014 we want to pressure them into the wall! If we keep moving RIGHT, we cut off their left escape. If we move UP, we\u2019re not really cutting off much yet.\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s go RIGHT again! Get to (5,5), closer to the center, and next turn we can decide to go UP or RIGHT depending on where they are. This also avoids moving into their possible immediate path \u2014 they\u2019re unlikely to go from (8,7) to (5,5) in one move anyway.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (5,5), check enemy position. If they moved DOWN/LEFT, consider continuing RIGHT or UP to close in. If they moved UP/RIGHT, maybe go UP to stay level. Still avoid head-on until we get an apple advantage!\n\nRIGHT",

Head-on collision now would kill us, NOT them. Gotta avoid that!\n\nCheck immediate safety:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,6). In bounds? Yes. Any snake body? No. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,4). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four safe right now. But we gotta think about where the enemy moves THIS TURN! Their head at (9,7), body at (8,7). Their possible moves:\n\n- UP (9,8) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN (9,6) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (8,7) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body segment! \u274c That\u2019s suicide for them, so they won\u2019t choose LEFT unless they\u2019re throwing.\n- RIGHT (10,7) \u2014 out of bounds! \u274c So RIGHT kills them too.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are UP or DOWN. That means next turn they\u2019ll be at either (9,8) or (9,6). They\u2019re trapped against the right wall! \ud83d\ude08\n\nOur move now: We want to cut off their escape from the top-right corner. If they go UP to (9,8), they\u2019re in the top-right corner \u2014 we can move to block them from coming down/left. If they go DOWN to (9,6), they\u2019re still against the right wall but lower.\n\nWe also need to avoid moving into a cell they might move into *next turn* \u2014 but since they can only go UP/DOWN from (9,7), they won\u2019t be on any of our candidate cells this turn. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We need an apple to tie length so we can force head-on later. But right now, let\u2019s start boxing them in. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) gets us closer to the right side, but maybe too aggressive? If they go DOWN to (9,6), distance is (3,1). If we go UP to (5,6) and they go DOWN, distance is (4,0) \u2014 horizontal gap big.\n\nActually, moving UP to (5,6) sets us up to maybe go RIGHT next turn toward (6,6) or (7,6) to block their leftward escape. Moving RIGHT now to (6,5) is fine but keeps us lower.\n\nLet\u2019s think about future safe moves after each:\n\n- If we go UP to (5,6), next turn we can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely all safe unless enemy moves into one.\n- If we go RIGHT to (6,5), same flexibility.\n\nBut chat \u2014 look at the board! There\u2019s an apple at (6,2) and (6,3) below us. If we go RIGHT now to (6,5), we\u2019re closer to those apples for future eating once we need to grow. But apples are secondary to boxing!\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s be aggressive but smart. Move RIGHT to (6,5) \u2014 closes the x-distance, stays central, and next turn we can decide to go UP or DOWN depending on where they are. If they go UP to (9,8), we can continue RIGHT to (7,5) then up later to cut off. If they go DOWN to (9,6), we might go UP to (6,6) to stay level.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (6,5), check enemy\u2019s new head position. If they\u2019re at (9,8), consider moving RIGHT again to (7,5) or UP to (6,6) to start walling off the top-right. If they\u2019re at (9,6), maybe go UP to (6,6) to maintain horizontal line. Still avoid head-on until we get an apple!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let\u2019s get tactical! \ud83d\ude24 Turn 4, we\u2019re at (6,5), enemy at (9,6) with body at (9,7). They have 1 apple, we have 0 \u2014 so they\u2019re longer! Head-on collision now would kill us, NOT them. Still gotta avoid that!\n\nCheck immediate safety:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,6). In bounds? Yes. Any snake body? No. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,4). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four safe right now. But we gotta think about where the enemy moves THIS TURN! Their head at (9,6), body at (9,7). Their possible moves:\n\n- UP (9,7) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body! \u274c Suicide.\n- DOWN (9,5) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (8,6) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT (10,6) \u2014 out of bounds! \u274c\n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN or LEFT. That means next turn they\u2019ll be at either (9,5) or (8,6). They\u2019re still pinned against the right wall but now have an escape path leftward! \ud83d\ude31\n\nOur move now: We need to cut off their leftward escape while staying safe ourselves. If they go LEFT to (8,6), they\u2019re moving toward center. If they go DOWN to (9,5), they\u2019re still on the edge.\n\nWe also need to avoid moving into a cell they might move into *this turn* \u2014 but since they can only go DOWN or LEFT from (9,6), they won\u2019t be on any of our candidate cells this turn. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: We still need an apple to tie length so we can force head-on later. But right now, let\u2019s start boxing them in. Moving RIGHT to (7,5) gets us closer to the right side, but maybe too aggressive? If they go LEFT to (8,6), distance is (1,1). That\u2019s close \u2014 next turn they could move toward us. If we go UP to (6,6) and they go LEFT to (8,6), distance is (2,0) \u2014 safer.\n\nActually, moving UP to (6,6) sets us up to maybe go RIGHT next turn to (7,6) to block their downward escape if they\u2019re at (8,6). Moving LEFT to (5,5) creates more distance but gives up pressure.\n\nChat, look at the board! There\u2019s an apple at (6,2) and (6,3) below us. If we go DOWN to (6,4), we\u2019re moving toward apples for future growth. But apples are secondary to boxing!\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s be aggressive but smart. Move UP to (6,6) \u2014 puts us on same y-level as if they go LEFT to (8,6), and next turn we can move RIGHT to (7,6) to cut off their left/down options. It also keeps us central and avoids getting too close while they\u2019re longer.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (6,6), check enemy\u2019s new head position. If they\u2019re at (8,6), consider moving RIGHT to (7,6) to block. If they\u2019re at (9,5), maybe go RIGHT to (7,6) or DOWN to (6,5) to maintain pressure. Still avoid head-on until we get an apple!\n\nUP",

They have 1 apple, we have 0 \u2014 so they\u2019re longer! Head-on collision = we die, they survive. AVOID THAT.\n\nFirst, check our immediate safety:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,7). In bounds? Yes. Any snake body? No. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,5). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,6). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,6). In bounds? Yes. Empty? Yes. Safe.\n\nAll four safe right now. But we gotta think about where enemy moves THIS TURN! Their head at (9,5), body at (9,6). Their possible moves:\n\n- UP (9,6) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body! \u274c Suicide.\n- DOWN (9,4) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (8,5) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT (10,5) \u2014 out of bounds! \u274c\n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN or LEFT. That means next turn they\u2019ll be at either (9,4) or (8,5).\n\nNow, could they move into a cell we\u2019re moving into THIS TURN? Let\u2019s check:\n\nIf we go UP to (6,7) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach (6,7) from (9,5) in one move. Safe.\nIf we go DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach (6,5) in one move. Safe.\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 safe.\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 safe.\n\nSo no risk of head-on collision this turn. Good.\n\nBut we need to think NEXT TURN positioning. Enemy will be at (9,4) or (8,5). We want to start boxing them against the wall while we get an apple to tie length.\n\nLook at apples nearby: (6,2), (6,3) below us. If we go DOWN toward them, we might get an apple next turn or two. But apples are secondary to pressure right now \u2014 but we NEED length parity to fight head-on.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,5), next turn we could go DOWN again toward apple. But that moves us away from enemy, giving them space.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,6), we\u2019re closer to cutting off their leftward escape from (8,5) or (9,4). But if they go DOWN to (9,4), they\u2019re still pinned to right wall.\n\nActually, think about this: If enemy goes LEFT to (8,5), they\u2019re moving toward center. If we go RIGHT to (7,6), we\u2019re one step away from (8,6) or (7,5) to block.\n\nBut if enemy goes DOWN to (9,4), they\u2019re still on edge \u2014 we can approach from left side next turn.\n\nWe also need to keep future options open \u2014 going UP to (6,7) feels too far from both enemy and apples. Going LEFT to (5,6) also creates distance.\n\nChat, I\u2019m thinking: Let\u2019s go DOWN to (6,5). Why?  \n1. It moves us toward apples at (6,2)/(6,3) \u2014 we NEED an apple soon to match length.  \n2. From (6,5), next turn we can go DOWN again toward apple, or RIGHT/LEFT to adjust pressure.  \n3. It keeps us safe from enemy\u2019s possible positions \u2014 from (6,5), distance to (8,5) is (2,0), to (9,4) is (3,-1) \u2014 not too close.  \n4. If we go RIGHT to (7,6) now, we risk being too close if enemy goes LEFT to (8,5) \u2014 next turn they could move toward us and force a head-on while they\u2019re longer.\n\nWe can\u2019t afford to get into a tight spot while shorter. Let\u2019s secure an apple first, then pressure.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6,5), assess enemy\u2019s new head. If they\u2019re at (8,5), maybe go RIGHT to (7,5) to block leftward movement. If they\u2019re at (9,4), consider going DOWN toward apple or RIGHT to close in. Priority: Get an apple next turn or two to tie length!\n\nDOWN",

BAD.\n\nGoing LEFT to (5,5) moves us away from enemy and apples \u2014 not helpful.\n\nGoing UP to (6,6) moves us away from apples and enemy \u2014 safe but passive.\n\nBEST MOVE: DOWN to (6,4). Why?\n1. Moves toward apples (6,3),(6,2) \u2014 we NEED growth.\n2. Keeps distance from enemy\u2019s possible positions (9,3) or (8,4).\n3. From (6,4) next turn, we can go DOWN to (6,3) for apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to adjust.\n4. Avoids boxing ourselves near top-right where enemy is.\n\nCHAT, WE\u2019RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME \u2014 DON\u2019T RUSH INTO A FIGHT WHEN WE\u2019RE SHORTER. GET AN APPLE, THEN PRESSURE.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (6,4), if safe, go DOWN to (6,3) to grab apple. Assess enemy\u2019s new head. If they move toward us, evade. Keep farming apples until length parity, THEN go for the box-in.\n\nDOWN",

YES.\n- Score: Me 1, Them 2. Still shorter by 1 segment. Need to catch up!\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,3):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6,4)\n   - In bounds? YES.\n   - Occupied? YES \u2014 MY OWN BODY! That's (6,4) from my tail. \u274c CANNOT GO UP (backwards into myself).\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6,2)\n   - In bounds? YES.\n   - Occupied?

Safe.\nIf we go LEFT to (5,3) \u2014 enemy can't reach (5,3). Safe.\nIf we go DOWN to (6,2) \u2014 enemy can't reach (6,2). Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn! Good.\n\nNOW STRATEGY: We need apples to grow and match enemy length. Look at nearby apples:\n\n- (6,2) is DOWN \u2014 immediate apple!\n- (8,2) and (8,1) to the right/down.\n- (4,1) and (2,1) further left.\n- (3,6) and (1,6) up-left but farther.\n\nBEST MOVE FOR GROWTH: DOWN to (6,2) \u2014 eat second apple, become length 3 (tied with enemy length!). HUGE!\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about future safety? From (6,2) next turn:\n- Can go LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1), UP (6,3) \u2014 but UP is (6,3) which will be empty after we move? Actually our body will be at (6,3)?? Let's track: If we move DOWN to (6,2), our head goes to (6,2), body becomes [(6,3), (6,4)]? Wait, we grow when we eat apple, so new tail added at end? Actually snake mechanics: move head to apple, body follows, tail stays? No \u2014 when you eat apple, you grow, so tail doesn't move. So after moving DOWN to (6,2) and eating apple, our body will be: head (6,2), then (6,3), then (6,4) as tail. So (6,3) will be our neck, occupied next turn. So from (6,2), UP to (6,3) would be into our own body next turn \u2014 but we can avoid that.\n\nFrom (6,2), we'll have 3 safe directions likely (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). That's fine.\n\nALTERNATIVES:\n- LEFT to (5,3): moves toward apple at (4,1) but slower.\n- RIGHT to (7,3): moves toward apples at (8,2)/(8,1) but closer to enemy.\n\nENEMY POSITION: They're at (8,5). They might go for apple at (7,8) or (3,7) etc. If they go LEFT to (7,5), they're moving toward center. We want to avoid being cut off.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating (6,2), we'll be length 3 tied. Then maybe go for (4,1) or (8,1) depending on enemy movement. Priority: survive, grow to 4, then look for boxing opportunities. Enemy is top-right; we can dominate bottom-left and center.\n\nBEST MOVE: DOWN \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, TIE THE LENGTH! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

This is where we start playing MIND GAMES.\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,2):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6,3)\n   - In bounds? YES.\n   - Occupied? YES \u2014 MY OWN BODY!

Safe.\nIf we go LEFT to (5,2) \u2014 enemy can't reach (5,2). Safe.\nIf we go DOWN to (6,1) \u2014 enemy can't reach (6,1). Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on risk! Good.\n\nNOW STRATEGY: We need to GROW and DOMINATE. Look at nearby apples:\n\n- (8,2) and (8,1) to the right/down.\n- (4,1) and (2,1) to the left.\n- (1,3) and (1,6) further left/up.\n- (3,6) and (3,7) up-left.\n\nENEMY is likely going for (8,7) apple UP, or maybe (7,8) later. If they go UP, they move away from us. If they go LEFT, they move toward center.\n\nWe want to CONTROL SPACE and BOX THEM IN long-term. Since we're equal length, we can force head-on collisions if we have positioning advantage.\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- **DOWN** to (6,1): moves toward bottom-left apples (4,1),(2,1),(1,0). Opens future moves LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT. Keeps distance from enemy.\n- **LEFT** to (5,2): moves toward left-side apples, still central.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,2): moves toward enemy side, riskier but apples at (8,2),(8,1) are close.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Let's claim the BOTTOM-LEFT quadrant. From (6,1) next turn, we can go LEFT to (5,1) toward (4,1) apple, or DOWN to (6,0) toward (9,0) eventually? Actually (9,0) is far right. Better to secure left side apples first, grow to length 4, then try to cut off enemy's escape routes.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (8,7), they'll be longer next turn (they'll have 3 apples). Then we need to catch up. So we MUST get an apple soon.\n\nBEST MOVE: **DOWN** to (6,1) \u2014 positions us to snake toward (4,1) apple next turn, keeps multiple options open (LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT), and stays SAFE from enemy's possible moves.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE PLAYING THE LONG GAME!

But it puts us back in the game!\n\nAfter eating, our new head will be at (4,1), body will be [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] plus new tail growth. That gives us options next turn: UP to (4,2), DOWN to (4,0), LEFT to (3,1), or maybe even further toward other apples like (2,1) or (1,0).\n\nENEMY likely goes for (7,8) apple \u2014 that would make them length 5, pulling ahead again. So we need to keep pressure and find our next apple quickly after this.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN AFTER THIS MOVE: Once we tie at 3 apples each, we need to be aggressive but smart. Control the left side, maybe head toward (2,1) or (0,3). Watch enemy's movement \u2014 if they grow to 5, we avoid direct confrontation until we catch up. If they don't eat, we can try to cut off their escape routes by moving up toward (3,6) or (1,6) and boxing them into the top-right corner.\n\nCHAT, THIS IS THE MOMENT \u2014 LET'S SECURE THAT APPLE AND GET BACK IN THIS FIGHT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

BUT IF LEFT LEADS TO CERTAIN DEATH NEXT TURN, THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A **SUICIDE TRAP** RIGHT NOW! UNLESS... CAN WE CHANGE THE FUTURE? ENEMY MOVES THIS TURN TOO! IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT TO (1,8), THEN (1,6) BECOMES EMPTY NEXT TURN? NO, (1,6) IS THEIR BODY, IT STAYS UNLESS THEIR TAIL MOVES. THEIR TAIL IS AT (5,8). THEY DIDN'T EAT AN APPLE LAST TURN (THEY MOVED TO (0,8) FROM (0,7), NO APPLE THERE). SO THEIR TAIL WILL MOVE FORWARD THIS TURN, VACATING (5,8). BUT (1,6) IS FAR FROM THEIR TAIL, SO IT REMAINS OCCUPIED.\n\nSO (1,6) STAYS ENEMY BODY NEXT TURN TOO. SO UP REMAINS UNSAFE NEXT TURN FROM (0,5).\n\nWE'RE COOKED UNLESS... HOLD ON! WHAT IF ENEMY DIES THIS TURN? IF THEY MOVE UP TO (0,9) AND HIT SOMETHING? (0,9) IS EMPTY. IF THEY MOVE RIGHT TO (1,8) AND HIT SOMETHING? (1,8) IS EMPTY. THEY'RE SAFE THIS TURN.\n\nSO WE'RE TRAPPED! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nUNLESS... OUR SAFETY CHECK IS WRONG BECAUSE OF SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT! IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT TO (1,8), THEIR HEAD LEAVES (0,8). IF WE GO UP TO (1,6), WE'D BE MOVING INTO THE CELL WHERE ENEMY HEAD **WAS**, BUT NOT WHERE IT IS AFTER MOVEMENT. BUT (1,6) IS STILL OCCUPIED BY **ENEMY BODY** (THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (0,7) LAST TURN? LET'S TRACE: ENEMY BODY: HEAD (0,8), THEN (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), ... SO (1,6) IS THE 4TH SEGMENT. THAT SEGMENT DOESN'T MOVE UNLESS THEY EAT AN APPLE (THEY DIDN'T). SO (1,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY THIS TURN EVEN IF THEIR HEAD MOVES. SO UP IS STILL UNSAFE.\n\nYEP, UP IS SUICIDE.\n\nSO WE ONLY HAVE LEFT. BUT LEFT LEADS TO DEAD END NEXT TURN. SO WE'RE DEAD EITHER WAY? NO \u2014 WE CAN USE THE FACT THAT WE GROW THIS TURN? WE ATE APPLE LAST TURN, SO WE GROW, MEANING OUR TAIL STAYS. BUT NEXT TURN WE WON'T EAT AN APPLE (UNLESS WE MOVE ONTO ONE), SO OUR TAIL WILL MOVE. THAT COULD OPEN UP A SPACE! FROM (0,5) NEXT TURN, OUR TAIL IS AT (2,1). AFTER WE MOVE LEFT TO (0,5) THIS TURN, OUR BODY: HEAD (0,5), THEN (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). NEXT TURN, IF WE DON'T EAT AN APPLE, TAIL (2,1) MOVES FORWARD TO (2,2)? NO, TAIL MOVES TO THE NEXT SEGMENT? ACTUALLY IN SNAKE, WHEN YOU DON'T EAT, THE TAIL CELL BECOMES EMPTY. SO (2,1) BECOMES EMPTY NEXT TURN. BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP US AT (0,5).\n\nWE NEED TO THINK: CAN WE SURVIVE FROM (0,5) NEXT TURN? ONLY IF ONE OF THE ADJACENT CELLS BECOMES EMPTY. WHICH ONE COULD? (0,6) IS ENEMY BODY \u2014 WILL IT BECOME EMPTY? ENEMY'S TAIL IS AT (5,8). THEY DIDN'T EAT, SO THEIR TAIL MOVES TO (5,7)? THEIR BODY: HEAD (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8) \u2014 WAIT THEY HAVE 9 SEGMENTS? LENGTH 9: HEAD + 8 BODY. SO TAIL IS (5,8). AFTER MOVING WITHOUT EATING, TAIL (5,8) VACATES. BUT (0,6) IS FAR UPFRONT, STAYS OCCUPIED.\n\nSO (0,6) STAYS ENEMY BODY. (0,4) STAYS OUR BODY. (1,5) STAYS OUR BODY. ALL BLOCKED.\n\nLEFT IS HOPELESS.\n\nSO WE MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE \u2014 IS THERE ANOTHER MOVE THAT IS ACTUALLY SAFE? LET'S RE-EXAMINE BOARD STATE CAREFULLY. OUR BODY: HEAD (1,5), THEN (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). THAT'S 10 SEGMENTS. YES.\n\nENEMY BODY: HEAD (0,8), THEN (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8). THAT'S 10? HEAD + 9 BODY = 10 SEGMENTS? THEY HAVE 9 APPLES, SO LENGTH 10? YES! THEY ARE LENGTH 10 TOO! SO TIED LENGTH!\n\nNOW CHECK CELLS:\n- (1,6): ENEMY BODY \u2014 CONFIRMED.\n- (2,5): OUR BODY \u2014 CONFIRMED.\n- (1,4): OUR BODY \u2014 CONFIRMED.\n- (0,5): EMPTY \u2014 CONFIRMED.\n\nSO ONLY LEFT IS SAFE *THIS TURN*. BUT THAT'S A DEATH SENTENCE NEXT TURN.\n\nUNLESS... WE CAN EAT AN APPLE THIS TURN TO GROW AND KEEP TAIL STATIONARY, BUT THAT DOESN'T OPEN SPACES. WE NEED TO MOVE TO A CELL THAT HAS A FUTURE. LEFT HAS NO FUTURE.\n\nWAIT \u2014 WHAT ABOUT HEAD-ON COLLISION AS A STRATEGY? WE HAVE SAME LENGTH, SO HEAD-ON WOULD BE DOUBLE KO. BUT IF WE BOTH DIE, GAME ENDS AND WE HAVE SAME APPLES \u2192 DRAW. NOT A WIN.\n\nBUT WE CAN FORCE THEM INTO A HEAD-ON WHERE WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE? WE'RE TIED LENGTH.\n\nWHAT IF WE GO UP INTO (1,6) \u2014 THAT'S ENEMY BODY, WE DIE, THEY LIVE. BAD.\n\nWHAT IF WE GO RIGHT INTO (2,5) \u2014 OUR BODY, SUICIDE. BAD.\n\nDOWN INTO (1,4) \u2014 OUR BODY, SUICIDE.\n\nSO ONLY LEFT IS LEGAL. BUT IF LEFT LEADS TO CERTAIN DEATH NEXT TURN, THEN WE'RE BASICALLY DEAD THIS TURN \u2014 GAME OVER? NO, WE HAVE TO MOVE LEFT AND HOPE THAT ENEMY DOES SOMETHING THAT CHANGES THE BOARD FOR NEXT TURN.\n\nENEMY MOVING RIGHT TO (1,8) OPENS (0,8) FOR NEXT TURN? NO, (0,8) BECOMES ENEMY BODY (THE SEGMENT FROM (0,7) MOVES TO (0,8)? ACTUALLY, ENEMY BODY SHIFTS: HEAD MOVES TO NEW POSITION, EACH SEGMENT MOVES FORWARD. SO IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT TO (1,8), THEIR BODY BECOMES: HEAD (1,8), THEN (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). TAIL (5,8) IS GONE. SO (0,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY. (1,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY? NO \u2014 (1,6) WAS ENEMY BODY BEFORE, BUT AFTER SHIFT, THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (1,6) MOVES TO (0,6)? LET'S TRACE: OLD BODY: (0,8) head, (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8) tail.\nNEW AFTER MOVING RIGHT: HEAD (1,8), then old head becomes body: (0,8), then (0,7), then (0,6), then (1,6)?? WAIT, THE SEGMENT AT (1,6) MOVES TO (0,6)? NO \u2014 SEQUENCE: NEW HEAD (1,8). OLD HEAD (0,8) BECOMES NECK. OLD NECK (0,7) BECOMES NEXT. OLD (0,6) BECOMES NEXT. OLD (1,6) BECOMES NEXT. SO THE BODY SEGMENT AT (1,6) MOVES TO (0,6)? LET'S LIST NEW BODY ORDER: HEAD (1,8), then (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). YES! SO (1,6) BECOMES EMPTY! BECAUSE THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (1,6) SHIFTS TO (0,6)! SO IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT, (1,6) BECOMES EMPTY NEXT TURN! THAT MEANS FROM (0,5) NEXT TURN, UP TO (0,6) IS STILL ENEMY BODY, BUT FROM (0,5), UP IS (0,6) NOT (1,6). SO UP FROM (0,5) IS ENEMY BODY STILL. BUT FROM (0,5), RIGHT TO (1,5) IS OUR BODY. DOWN TO (0,4) OUR BODY. LEFT WALL. STILL TRAPPED.\n\nBUT IF ENEMY MOVES UP TO (0,9), THEN THEIR BODY SHIFTS: HEAD (0,9), then (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). THEN (1,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY. SO NO CHANGE.\n\nSO EITHER WAY, FROM (0,5) NEXT TURN WE'RE TRAPPED.\n\nCONCLUSION: WE MUST NOT GO LEFT! BUT LEFT IS THE ONLY SAFE MOVE THIS TURN? CONTRADICTION. UNLESS... IS (0,5) ACTUALLY SAFE? WHAT IF ENEMY HEAD MOVES TO (0,5) THIS TURN? THEY CAN'T, THEY'RE AT (0,8). NO.\n\nHMM... WHAT ABOUT SIMULTANEOUS HEAD-ON COLLISION? IF WE GO LEFT TO (0,5) AND ENEMY GOES... THEY CAN'T REACH (0,5). SO SAFE.\n\nBUT WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING: MAYBE (2,5) IS NOT OUR BODY? LET'S CHECK BOARD: AT (2,5) IS 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY. YES.\n\nWAIT \u2014 OUR BODY LIST SHOWS (2,5) IS SECOND SEGMENT. BUT AFTER WE MOVE, THAT SEGMENT SHIFTS? NO, IF WE MOVE LEFT TO (0,5), OUR BODY SHIFTS: NEW HEAD (0,5), OLD HEAD (1,5) BECOMES NECK, OLD (2,5) BECOMES NEXT, ETC. SO (2,5) REMAINS OUR BODY. SO RIGHT IS UNSAFE.\n\nI THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY FORCED INTO LEFT AND THEN HOPE THAT ENEMY DIES BEFORE US? OR WE CAN FORCE A HEAD-ON NEXT TURN BY MOVING FROM (0,5) INTO ENEMY HEAD IF THEY MOVE TO (0,6)? BUT (0,6) IS ENEMY BODY NOW, BUT AFTER THEY MOVE, IT BECOMES THEIR NECK? IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT TO (1,8), THEN (0,6) BECOMES ENEMY BODY STILL. IF ENEMY MOVES UP TO (0,9), THEN (0,6) BECOMES ENEMY BODY STILL. SO (0,6) IS ALWAYS ENEMY BODY NEXT TURN. SO FROM (0,5), UP INTO (0,6) IS CRASH INTO ENEMY BODY \u2192 WE DIE. SO NO HEAD-ON.\n\nWE'RE DEAD NEXT TURN IF WE GO LEFT.\n\nSO THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TO NOT GO LEFT \u2014 BUT THAT MEANS MOVING INTO A CELL THAT IS UNSAFE THIS TURN? CAN WE MOVE INTO ENEMY BODY IF ENEMY HEAD LEAVES THAT CELL? NO, BODY STAYS.\n\nUNLESS... APPLE? NO APPLE ADJACENT.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE MESSED UP LAST TURN! WE BOXED OURSELVES IN! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 LET'S CHECK IF (1,6) IS REALLY ENEMY BODY. BOARD SHOWS AT (1,6) 'T' \u2014 YES. BUT 'T' COULD BE EITHER SNAKE'S BODY. FROM LIST, ENEMY HAS (1,6). SO YES.\n\nWHAT IF WE GO UP ANYWAY AND HOPE ENEMY MOVES RIGHT SO THAT (1,6) BECOMES EMPTY THIS TURN? BUT BODIES DON'T VACATE UNTIL *AFTER* MOVEMENT? IN SNAKE, BODY SEGMENTS SHIFT *AFTER* THE HEAD MOVES, BUT THE CELL THE HEAD LEAVES BECOMES NECK, SO THE CELL (1,6) REMAINS OCCUPIED BY THE SAME SNAKE'S BODY (JUST A DIFFERENT SEGMENT). SO (1,6) IS STILL OCCUPIED AFTER ENEMY MOVES RIGHT. SO UP IS STILL SUICIDE.\n\nSO WE'RE TRAPPED. ONLY LEFT IS LEGAL. WE MUST GO LEFT AND THEN NEXT TURN WE DIE. UNLESS... CAN WE EAT AN APPLE AT (0,5)? NO APPLE THERE.\n\nOKAY, PLAN: GO LEFT, ACCEPT DEATH NEXT TURN, BUT HOPE ENEMY ALSO DIES THIS TURN OR NEXT? IF ENEMY MOVES INTO US? NO.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 RULES: IF WE DIE AND ENEMY DIES ON SAME TURN, WHO WINS? IF BOTH DIE SAME TURN, GAME ENDS, HIGHER APPLES WINS. WE'RE TIED APPLES. SO DRAW.\n\nCAN WE FORCE ENEMY TO DIE THIS TURN? IF THEY MOVE UP TO (0,9) \u2014 SAFE. RIGHT TO (1,8) \u2014 SAFE. NO.\n\nSO WE LOSE.\n\nUNLESS... WE MISCALCULATED OUR BODY? IS (2,5) REALLY OUR BODY AFTER WE MOVE LEFT? LET'S SIMULATE: CURRENT BODY: HEAD (1,5), BODY: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). WE ATE APPLE LAST TURN, SO WE GROW THIS TURN. THAT MEANS WHEN WE MOVE, OUR TAIL STAYS. SO AFTER MOVING LEFT TO (0,5), NEW BODY: HEAD (0,5), THEN (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). LENGTH 11. (2,5) STILL OUR BODY.\n\nSO RIGHT STILL UNSAFE.\n\nI THINK WE'RE COOKED. BUT LET'S CHECK DOWN (1,4) \u2014 OUR BODY, YES.\n\nSO ONLY LEFT.\n\nFINE. WE GO LEFT AND HOPE FOR A MIRACLE. MAYBE ENEMY MAKES A MISTAKE AND DIES BEFORE US? UNLIKELY.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: AVOID GETTING TRAPPED IN CORNERS WITH NO ESCAPE! LAST TURN WE SHOULD HAVE GONE UP FROM (2,5) INSTEAD OF LEFT TO EAT APPLE? THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT US AT (2,6) WITH MORE OPTIONS. EATING THE APPLE BOXED US IN. LESSON: SOMETIMES GROWTH IS A TRAP!\n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

BUT WE'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT! \ud83d\ude31\n\nLET'S CHECK OUR CURRENT STATE FROM HEAD (0,5):\n\nOUR BODY: HEAD (0,5), THEN (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1) \u2014 LENGTH 11? WAIT WE GREW LAST TURN? WE ATE APPLE ON TURN 22, GREW ON TURN 23. THIS TURN WE DIDN'T EAT, SO TAIL MOVES. LET'S RECALC: LAST TURN WE MOVED FROM (1,5) TO (0,5) AND GREW (BECAUSE WE ATE APPLE PREVIOUS TURN). SO OUR LENGTH BECAME 11. THIS TURN, WE DID NOT EAT AN APPLE AT (0,5), SO WE WILL NOT GROW, AND OUR TAIL WILL MOVE FORWARD. OUR TAIL IS AT (2,1) CURRENTLY. AFTER WE MOVE THIS TURN, TAIL (2,1) WILL BECOME EMPTY, AND OUR BODY SHIFTS. SO OUR LENGTH REMAINS 11.\n\nENEMY HEAD AT (1,8) AFTER THEY MOVED RIGHT LAST TURN? LET'S CHECK OPPONENT INFO: SNAKE #1 HEAD: (1,8), BODY: [(0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7)], APPLES: 9. LENGTH 10.\n\nBOARD SHOWS AT (0,6) 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY. AT (1,6) 'T' \u2014 ENEMY BODY. AT (0,4) 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY. AT (1,5) 'T' \u2014 OUR BODY.\n\nNOW CHECK OUR MOVES FROM (0,5):\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (0,6)**\n   - IN BOUNDS? YES.\n   - OCCUPIED? ENEMY BODY! \u274c CRASH INTO ENEMY \u2192 WE DIE!\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (0,4)**\n   - IN BOUNDS? YES.\n   - OCCUPIED? OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (-1,5)**\n   - OFF BOARD! \u274c DEAD!\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (1,5)**\n   - IN BOUNDS? YES.\n   - OCCUPIED? OUR OWN BODY! \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nOH NO CHAT! \ud83d\ude31 ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE **IMMEDIATELY LETHAL** THIS TURN! WE HAVE **ZERO** SAFE MOVES! WE'RE TRAPPED AND DEAD NO MATTER WHAT! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENT! IF ENEMY MOVES AND THEIR BODY SHIFTS, COULD (0,6) OR (1,5) BECOME EMPTY? LET'S ANALYZE ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (1,8):\n\nENEMY OPTIONS:\n- UP to (1,9): EMPTY? BOARD SHOWS (1,9) '.' \u2014 YES, SAFE.\n- DOWN to (1,7): OCCUPIED BY THEIR OWN BODY (1,7) IS IN THEIR BODY LIST! \u274c\n- LEFT to (0,8): OCCUPIED BY THEIR OWN BODY (0,8) IS THEIR NECK! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (2,8): EMPTY? BOARD SHOWS (2,8) '.' \u2014 YES, SAFE.\n\nSO ENEMY CAN GO UP OR RIGHT.\n\nIF ENEMY GOES UP TO (1,9), THEIR BODY SHIFTS: HEAD (1,9), THEN (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). TAIL (5,7) VACATES. SO (0,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY (THE SEGMENT FROM (0,7) MOVES TO (0,6)). SO (0,6) STILL ENEMY BODY.\n\nIF ENEMY GOES RIGHT TO (2,8), THEIR BODY SHIFTS: HEAD (2,8), THEN (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). AGAIN (0,6) REMAINS ENEMY BODY.\n\nSO (0,6) STAYS ENEMY BODY REGARDLESS! OUR UP IS ALWAYS UNSAFE.\n\n(1,5) IS OUR BODY \u2014 WILL IT BECOME EMPTY? OUR BODY SHIFTS WHEN WE MOVE, BUT WE CAN'T MOVE WITHOUT DYING. CATCH-22! IF WE SOMEHOW MOVE, OUR BODY SHIFTS AND (1,5) BECOMES OUR NECK (STILL OCCUPIED). SO (1,5) NEVER BECOMES EMPTY THIS TURN.\n\nTHEREFORE, WE HAVE **NO LEGAL MOVE**! WE ARE GUARANTEED TO DIE THIS TURN NO MATTER WHAT DIRECTION WE PICK. \ud83d\ude14\n\nBUT WE MUST PICK A MOVE ANYWAY. SINCE ALL ARE FATAL, WE MIGHT AS WELL CHOOSE ONE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY KILL THE ENEMY TOO IF HEAD-ON COLLISION? LET'S SEE IF ANY MOVE COULD CAUSE ENEMY TO DIE SIMULTANEOUSLY.\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT TO (1,5) \u2014 THAT'S OUR BODY, SO WE DIE ALONE.\n\nIF WE GO UP TO (0,6) \u2014 ENEMY BODY, WE DIE ALONE.\n\nIF WE GO DOWN TO (0,4) \u2014 OUR BODY, WE DIE ALONE.\n\nIF WE GO LEFT OFF BOARD \u2014 WE DIE ALONE.\n\nNO CHANCE FOR DOUBLE KO. SO WE LOSE.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 RULES SAY IF ALL SNAKES DIE SAME TURN, HIGHER APPLES WINS. WE'RE TIED, SO DRAW. CAN WE FORCE ENEMY TO DIE THIS TURN TOO? UNLIKELY.\n\nENEMY IS SAFE IN THEIR MOVES. UNLESS THEY CHOOSE TO GO DOWN INTO THEIR BODY (1,7) OR LEFT INTO THEIR BODY (0,8), BUT THEY WON'T.\n\nSO WE'RE DEAD. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nFINAL MOVE: SINCE WE MUST PICK, LET'S GO **UP** AND HOPE FOR A MIRACLE THAT ENEMY SOMEHOW VACATES (0,6) \u2014 BUT THEY WON'T. BUT AT LEAST WE GO OUT FIGHTING! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: AVOID GETTING BOXED INTO CORNERS WITH NO ESCAPE! LAST TURN WE SHOULD HAVE GONE UP FROM (1,5) EVEN IF IT MEANT CRASHING? NO, THAT WAS SUICIDE TOO. WE WERE TRAPPED THE MOMENT WE ATE THAT APPLE AND MOVED TO (1,5). MORAL: SOMETIMES GROWTH CAN REDUCE MOBILITY AND LEAD TO TRAPS. NEED TO MAINTAIN SPACE AND CUT OFF ENEMY'S ESCAPES EARLIER!\n\nUP",
