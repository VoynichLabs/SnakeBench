No self-collision, and no overlap with enemy segments at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4).

Not progress toward the target.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves to (5,8), making progress toward (7,9). However, it requires subsequent upward movement and risks slower progress compared to UP.\n\n**Long-term strategy**: Prioritize reaching the closest apple (7,9) while maintaining flexibility.

          "rationale": "To determine the optimal move,we must consider the current state of the game and the rules governing movement and survival. Our snake is currently at position (7,8), with a body composed of (7,9) and (6,9). This means that our snake is currently facing downward, as the last move was \"DOWN.\" The apples currently available on the board are at (9,6), (9,4), (4,8), (3,8), and (2,8), and we have collected 2 apples so far.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate Unsafe Moves\n\n- **UP** is invalid because it would place the head at (7,9), which is currently occupied by our own body.\n- **DOWN** is valid. It would move the head to (7,7), with the body becoming [(7,8), (7,9)].\n- **LEFT** is valid. It would place the head at (6,8), with the body becoming [(7,8), (7,9)].\n- **RIGHT** is valid. It would place the head at (8,8), with the body becoming [(7,8), (7,9)].\n\nSo the valid moves are **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Prioritize Apple Collection\n\nAmong the valid moves, we need to prioritize the path that leads us to the nearest apples while maintaining safety and future maneuverability.\n\n- **LEFT** takes us to (6,8), which is directly toward the three apples on the same row: (4,8), (3,8), and (2,8). These are within a few moves of our current position and are the closest apples available.\n- **RIGHT** leads us toward (9,6) and (9,4), but these are further away and require more turns to reach.\n- **DOWN** takes us away from the apples and into a less promising area.\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the most strategic move, as it places us in a better position to collect multiple apples in the current and upcoming turns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Future Safety and Flexibility\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (6,8) gives us a body that is [(7,8), (7,9)], and the next move can continue left to (5,8), then (4,8), which contains an apple. From there, we can continue to (3,8) and (2,8), each of which is also an apple.\n\nThis path allows for a straight-line pursuit of high-value targets (3 apples), minimizing the need for complex maneuvers. It also keeps the snake in open space, reducing the risk of being trapped.\n\nWhile moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** might have potential in the long term, they are less immediately rewarding and could lead to being outpaced by the opponent or missing out on nearby apples.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the proximity of the apples, the safety of the move, and the strategic advantage of collecting multiple apples in a row, the best move is:\n\n**LEFT**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue moving left along the row y=8 to collect the apples at (4,8), (3,8), and (2,8). After collecting these, consider moving right or down to target the apples at (9,6) and (9,4), depending on safety and enemy behavior. Always prioritize staying alive while maximizing apple collection.\n\n**MOVE:** LEFT",

          "rationale": "### Decision Rationale:\n\n1. **Current Safe Moves**: After eliminating the invalid \"UP\" direction (as it would collide with our own body), the remaining valid moves are **RIGHT**, **DOWN**, and **LEFT**.\n\n2. **Apple Collection Optimization**:\n   - Moving **DOWN** (8,8 \u2192 8,7) would collect the apple at (8,7) but leaves us directly below the enemy snake\u2019s head (which is currently at (8,6)). This creates a high-risk scenario: if the enemy moves **UP** in the same turn, their head would collide with ours, resulting in both snakes dying. Since the enemy has more apples (8 vs. our 6), this would lead to their victory.\n   - Moving **LEFT** (8,8 \u2192 7,8) allows us to collect the apple at (7,8) while staying farther from the enemy\u2019s current position at (8,6), minimizing the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n3. **Safety and Strategic Positioning**:\n   - Moving **LEFT** to (7,8) avoids the immediate danger of the enemy\u2019s possible upward movement. It also keeps our snake away from the enemy\u2019s current trajectory, reducing the risk of being surrounded or cornered.\n\n4. **Body Expansion and Future Flexibility**:\n   - Growing the snake by collecting the apple at (7,8) increases our length, improving our ability to block enemy movements or secure additional apples in future turns. The new body configuration allows flexibility to move downward, leftward, or even bisect the board more effectively than moving vertically.\n\n### Final Decision:  \nWe choose to move **LEFT** to collect the apple at (7,8), enhancing our position safely and avoiding high-risk scenarios. This move balances immediate reward with strategic positioning for future growth.\n\n**Answer:** LEFT",

UP to (2, 3): Would hit my own body - deadly!\n2. DOWN to (2, 1): Safe (empty space)\n3. LEFT to (1, 2): Safe (empty space)\n4. RIGHT to (3, 2): Safe (has apple at (3,2))\n\n**Apple Distances:**\n- (3,2): 1 right (distance 1) - closest!\n- (4,2): 2 right (distance 2)\n- (1,0): 1 left, 2 down (distance 3)\n- (6,2): 4 right (distance 4)\n- (7,0): 5 right, 2 down (distance 7)\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (3,5) can move:\n  - UP to (3,6): hits own body\n  - DOWN to (3,4): safe, but close to my body\n  - LEFT to (2,5): safe\n  - RIGHT to (4,5): hits my body at (4,5) - deadly for them!\n\n**Best Option:**\nRIGHT to (3,2) is the best move because:\n1. It's safe (no body collision)\n2. It immediately collects the apple at (3,2)\n3. It moves me closer to other apples at (4,2) and (6,2)\n4. It doesn't risk head-on collision with enemy\n5. After eating, I'll grow and have more strategic options\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,2) and eating the apple, I'll likely continue RIGHT toward (4,2) to collect another apple. I'll monitor the enemy's movements to avoid potential collisions, especially since they might try to move toward the same apples.\n\nRIGHT",
