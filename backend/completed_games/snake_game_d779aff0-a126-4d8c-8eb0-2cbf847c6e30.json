To maximize the apple intake and avoid potential collisions or wall impact:\n\n1. **Avoiding Enemy and Walls**:\n   - Snake #2 is at (8, 8). This snake poses no immediate threat as it does not block any path to nearby apples nor is it close enough to consider for an immediate move.\n   - There are no walls close enough to my current position that restrict movement in any cardinal direction.\n\n2. **Apple Collection Strategy**:\n   - Closest apples are at (6, 5), (3, 4), and (4, 1). The apple at (6, 5) is closest in terms of a direct path, requiring movement right and potentially down, which seems like a two-move strategy to grow.\n   - The apple at (3, 4) is also relatively close but would require moving left and then finding a path around to reach it without backtracking.\n\n3. **Safe and Optimal Path Concerns**:\n   - Moving up or down doesn't directly help reach an apple soon, whereas moving towards right then down is optimal for reaching the apple at (6, 5).\n\nConsidering the above observations:\n- Moving **RIGHT** initially is a strategic option to align with the apple at (6, 5). After collecting it, reassessing the board situation for the next closest apple either at (6, 9) or revisiting possibilities for the one at (3, 4) and (4, 1) would be needed.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT\n\n**Future Strategy Note:** After moving RIGHT, consider moving DOWN in the next turn to reach and consume the apple at (6, 5), then proceed either up the same column, if safe, to reach (6, 9) or reset the plan based on the updated positions of enemy snakes and other dynamics."

Apples at (6, 5) and (3, 4) are relatively nearby. Reaching the apple at (6, 5) requires moving RIGHT by 2 spaces and then DOWN by 2 spaces. This is closest and seems to be the most direct route.\n2. The apple at (3, 4) would require me to move LEFT and then DOWN to place me in the apple's column but this is more complex due to positioning.\n\n**Hazards and Obstacles:** \n- There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake which is located at (9, 8).\n- No body parts from snakes obstruct the necessary path towards the desired apple at (6, 5).\n  \n**Move Reasoning:**\n- Due to the proximity and ease of path toward the apple at (6, 5), the plan is to move RIGHT.\n- Future moves will involve reaching to the desired x-coordinate (6) and then adjusting the y-coordinate accordingly.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- After moving RIGHT, consider moving DOWN in the subsequent turns to eventually consume the apple at (6, 5).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT\nThis aligns me closer to the apple at (6, 5) and keeps the path simple without needing to navigate around obstacles or potential threats from enemy snakes."
