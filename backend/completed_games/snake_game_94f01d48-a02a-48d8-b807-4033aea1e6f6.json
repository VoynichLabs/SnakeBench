Since I'm currently at (7, 6), I can move up (6, 6), down (8, 6), left (7, 5), or right (7, 7).\n\nTo avoid colliding with the walls, I should not move up or left since that would take me outside the board.\n\nTo avoid colliding with other snakes, I should not move towards snake #1 at (9, 8) since it's directly above me.\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. I'm currently near the apple at (8, 9), so if I move up (6, 6), I might be able to reach it. However, there's no guarantee that snake #1 won't move and block my path.\n\nAnother strategy could be to move towards the cluster of apples at (5, 5) and (8, 5). If I move right (7, 7), I can potentially reach the apple at (8, 5) and then move down to collect the apple at (8, 8). This strategy would also allow me to avoid the apple at (8, 9) for now.\n\nHowever, since I'm currently near the apple at (8, 9), I decide to take a risk and move up (6, 6) to try and collect it. This move could potentially lead to a collision with snake #1, but it also gives me a chance to gain a point.\n\nNext move: UP (6, 6)"
