(6,8) and (7,9) both have 3 options next turn.  \n\nBut (6,8) is closer to multiple apples: (5,7) and (5,6) nearby.  \n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy at (7,7) might go LEFT to (6,7) to get apple (5,7) next turn. If I go DOWN to (6,8), I could go DOWN again to (6,7) next turn \u2014 but that risks head-on if enemy goes UP to (6,7)? Wait, enemy at (7,7) to (6,7) is LEFT, not UP. So if I go (6,8) \u2192 (6,7) next turn, enemy could also go (7,7) \u2192 (6,7) this turn? No, that's this turn's move. Actually, I'm thinking ahead:  \n\nThis turn:  \nMe: (6,9) \u2192 (6,8)  \nEnemy: (7,7) \u2192 ?  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (6,7), then next turn I'm at (6,8), enemy at (6,7) \u2014 we're adjacent, risk of head-on if I go DOWN to (6,7) next turn. But I can avoid that by going LEFT to (5,8) instead. So it's fine.  \n\nActually, safest for now is DOWN to (6,8) \u2014 keeps me closer to apples and away from enemy's immediate path (enemy likely heading for (5,7) via LEFT this turn or next).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,8), check if enemy took (5,7). If not, consider DOWN to (6,7) to grab it if safe, else go LEFT to (5,8) to approach apple while staying safe.  \n\n**Final choice:** DOWN  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s a head-on collision if enemy stays or moves into me? Wait: enemy is at (6, 7) now. If I go DOWN to (6, 7) and enemy moves away, it\u2019s empty. But if enemy stays at (6, 7) (by moving DOWN to (6, 7)? That\u2019s impossible because moving DOWN from (6, 7) would be (6, 6), so staying means moving into same cell? Actually, staying in place isn\u2019t allowed \u2014 they must move. So if enemy moves away from (6, 7) this turn, then (6, 7) is empty when I arrive. However, if enemy moves into (6, 7) from elsewhere? They can\u2019t, they start at (6, 7). So they must leave (6, 7) this turn. So (6, 7) will be empty unless another snake enters it \u2014 only snake #1 is there now. So DOWN is safe from immediate collision with stationary body. But there\u2019s a risk: if enemy moves UP to (6, 8) (my current head) at same time I move DOWN to (6, 7), we swap positions and no collision. That\u2019s safe. So DOWN is not automatically lethal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n\nAll four moves are physically possible without leaving board.  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7), enemy could go UP to (6, 8) \u2014 we swap, safe.  \nIf I go UP to (6, 9), enemy could go UP to (6, 8) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (5, 8), enemy could go LEFT to (5, 7) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 8), enemy could go RIGHT to (7, 7) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nNo direct head-on collision possible this turn except if we both choose same cell that\u2019s not each other\u2019s start? Let\u2019s check:  \nPossible enemy moves from (6, 7): UP (6, 8), DOWN (6, 6), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7) and enemy goes UP to (6, 8) \u2192 safe swap.  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (6, 6) \u2192 safe, I occupy (6, 7) alone.  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7) and enemy goes LEFT to (5, 7) \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 7) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to (6, 8) is (5, 7): distance 2.  \n- DOWN to (6, 7): distance to (5, 7) = 1.  \n- LEFT to (5, 8): distance to (5, 7) = 1.  \n- UP to (6, 9): distance to (5, 7) = 3.  \n- RIGHT to (7, 8): distance to (5, 7) = 3.  \n\nAlso (5, 6) is at distance from (6, 8) = 3; from (6, 7) = 2; from (5, 8) = 3.  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT both put me closer to nearest apple.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (6, 7): can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT unless blocked.  \nFrom (5, 8): can go UP (off board? y=9 is valid, so UP to (5,9) valid), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nBut (6, 7) is adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible positions next turn \u2014 could increase risk.  \n\n**Enemy likely move:**  \nEnemy at (6, 7) likely wants apple at (5, 7) \u2014 they might go LEFT to (5, 7) this turn. If they do, and I go DOWN to (6, 7), I\u2019m next to them but not colliding. Then next turn I could go LEFT to (5, 7) if they move away, or if they stay, head-on. But they\u2019d grow if they eat apple this turn, so their body extends to (6, 7)? Wait: if enemy eats apple at (5, 7) this turn, they grow: new head at (5, 7), tail stays at (6, 7) (since length 1 \u2192 length 2, body at old head). So (6, 7) becomes their body segment. That means if I go DOWN to (6, 7) this turn, and enemy eats apple and grows, I\u2019d be moving into their body (since their old head becomes body after move) \u2014 that kills me!  \n\nYes \u2014 simultaneous movement:  \nEnemy moves head to (5, 7), eats apple, grows \u2192 tail stays at (6, 7) (their old head position becomes new body segment).  \nI move head to (6, 7) \u2192 that\u2019s now enemy\u2019s body \u2192 I die.  \n\nSo DOWN is unsafe if enemy goes LEFT to (5, 7).  \n\nIs that guaranteed? Not guaranteed, but probable. So DOWN is risky.  \n\nLEFT to (5, 8) avoids that risk: enemy going LEFT to (5, 7) puts them at (5, 7), not colliding with me at (5, 8).  \n\n**Better choice:** LEFT to (5, 8) \u2014 closer to apple (5, 7) and safe from enemy\u2019s possible growth into (6, 7).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 8), if apple (5, 7) still there, consider DOWN to (5, 7) if enemy not there. If enemy is at (5, 7), avoid head-on, maybe go LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8) to stay flexible.  \n\nLEFT",

But I'll have to check next turn's options.\n- LEFT: moves toward other apples but not as immediate.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy at (5, 8) can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- If enemy moves DOWN into (5, 7) and I move DOWN into (5, 6), no collision because we're in different cells.\n- If enemy moves LEFT into (4, 8) or RIGHT into (6, 8), no conflict.\n- Only risk is if enemy moves DOWN into (5, 7) and I move LEFT into (4, 7) \u2014 no collision.\n\n**Future safety:**\n- DOWN: After eating apple at (5, 6), my body becomes [(6, 7), (5, 7)]? Wait \u2014 careful:  \n  Current: head (5, 7), body [(6, 7)].  \n  Move DOWN to (5, 6) \u2192 eat apple \u2192 new head at (5, 6), body becomes old head + old body = [(5, 7), (6, 7)].  \n  Next turn from (5, 6), possible moves:  \n  UP \u2192 (5, 7) = my body \u2192 not safe.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (5, 5) safe.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (4, 6) safe.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) safe.  \n  So 3 safe moves afterward \u2014 good.\n- LEFT: Move to (4, 7). Next turn from (4, 7):  \n  UP \u2192 (4, 8) safe.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (4, 6) safe.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (3, 7) safe.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7) safe (but that's my old head position \u2014 is it occupied next turn? No, because my body is [(6, 7)] only, so (5, 7) will be empty next turn if I move LEFT now). Yes, so 4 safe moves afterward.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Closest apple: (5, 6) is DOWN.\n- Other apples: (4, 3), (3, 3), (5, 4), (3, 6) \u2014 DOWN gets me closer to (5, 4) and (4, 3) cluster.\n\n**Risk of enemy:**\nEnemy might also want (5, 6) apple \u2014 but enemy at (5, 8) would need to move DOWN twice to get it. If I go DOWN, I get it first.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN gets apple immediately and positions me near more apples. LEFT is safe but defers eating. Given the need to collect apples to win, DOWN is better.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (5, 6), head toward (4, 3) or (5, 4) next, avoiding going back into body. Keep enemy above in mind \u2014 don't move up into its path.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state.  \n\n**My snake (ID 0):** Head at (5, 8), length 1, no body yet.  \n**Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 7), body at [(6, 7)], length 2 (since it ate an apple last turn).  \n**Apples:** (3, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (4, 3), (3, 6).  \n\n**Possible moves from (5, 8):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 7) \u2192 occupied by enemy head \u2192 head-on collision if enemy stays or moves into same cell? Let\u2019s check: enemy at (5, 7) could move UP (to 5,8 \u2014 my current head), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). If I go DOWN to (5,7) and enemy moves away, it\u2019s empty. But if enemy stays at (5,7) (impossible \u2014 they must move), or if enemy moves into (5,7) from elsewhere (impossible), so only risk is if enemy moves DOWN to (5,6) and I move DOWN to (5,7) \u2014 no collision. Wait, but enemy\u2019s body is at (6,7). If enemy moves LEFT to (4,7), then (5,7) is empty when I arrive. So DOWN is not automatically lethal from collision with enemy head *this turn*, because enemy can\u2019t be at (5,7) after moving unless they stay (illegal). However, enemy\u2019s body is at (6,7), not in (5,7). So DOWN into (5,7) is safe from enemy body this turn.  \n\nBut there\u2019s a **head-on collision risk** if enemy moves UP to (5,8) while I move DOWN to (5,7) \u2014 that\u2019s fine, no collision. Actually, the only way we collide heads is if we both choose the same cell. Could that be (5,7)? Enemy can\u2019t choose (5,7) because they start there. So no head-on at (5,7). Could we both choose (5,8)? I start at (5,8), so I can\u2019t move to (5,8). So no head-on possible this turn.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe from immediate death.  \n\nBut \u2014 if enemy moves UP to (5,8), they would die because my head is currently at (5,8) and they\u2019d move into me? Wait, simultaneous move: I move out of (5,8) to somewhere, they move into (5,8) if they choose UP. If I move DOWN to (5,7), (5,8) becomes empty (since I left), so enemy can move UP to (5,8) safely. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to (5,8) is (5,6) at distance 2.  \n- DOWN to (5,7): distance to (5,6) = 1.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): distance to (5,6) = 2.8 (approx).  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): distance to (5,6) = 2.2.  \n- UP to (5,9): distance to (5,6) = 3.  \n\nSo DOWN gets me closest to an apple.  \n\n**Risk of enemy growth into (5,7) as body?**  \nEnemy head at (5,7), body at (6,7). If enemy eats an apple this turn, they grow: new head moves, old head becomes new body segment at (5,7). But if I move into (5,7) this turn, I\u2019d be moving into a cell that becomes enemy body after movement? No \u2014 simultaneous movement:  \nEnemy moves head from (5,7) to new cell, eats apple, grows \u2192 old head (5,7) becomes body.  \nI move head from (5,8) to (5,7) at same time. At the moment of movement, (5,7) is still enemy head, not body. After movement, enemy head leaves (5,7), I arrive at (5,7), then growth adds body at old head position (5,7) \u2014 but I\u2019m already there as my head. That means my head ends up in same cell as enemy\u2019s new body segment? That would kill me (head into another snake\u2019s body).  \n\nYes \u2014 this is the key danger. If enemy eats any apple this turn (e.g., moves DOWN to (5,6) eats apple there), then after movement, their old head (5,7) becomes body, and I\u2019m at (5,7) \u2192 I die.  \n\nSo DOWN is unsafe if enemy eats an apple this turn.  \n\nIs enemy likely to eat an apple?  \nApples near enemy: (5,6) is directly below them at (5,7). They will likely go DOWN to (5,6) to eat it. So DOWN for me is very risky \u2014 probably lethal.  \n\n**Other moves:**  \nUP (5,9): safe, but far from apples.  \nLEFT (4,8): safe, moderate distance to apples.  \nRIGHT (6,8): safe, moderate distance to apples.  \n\nLEFT or RIGHT keep me safe from enemy growth risk.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (4,8): can go DOWN to (4,7) next turn toward apples.  \nFrom (6,8): can go DOWN to (6,7) but (6,7) is enemy body \u2014 not safe next turn unless enemy moves it.  \n\nBetter to go LEFT to (4,8) to stay flexible and approach apples from left side, avoiding enemy\u2019s likely path down toward (5,6) and (5,4).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,8), consider DOWN to (4,7) if safe, then toward apple at (4,3) or (3,3). Keep distance from enemy head, which will likely be at (5,6) or moving toward other apples.  \n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 7) (its own body) \u2192 invalid (death for enemy).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy cannot move UP into its own body, so UP is not an option for them.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8), enemy could move UP? No, they can\u2019t. So no head-on at (5, 8).  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7), enemy could move LEFT to (4, 6) \u2014 different cells, no collision.  \nIf I move LEFT to (3, 8), enemy far away.  \nIf I move UP to (4, 9), enemy far away.  \n\nSo all my moves are safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Risk of moving into enemy\u2019s future body:**  \nIf enemy eats an apple this turn, their old head becomes body.  \nEnemy\u2019s possible apple targets:  \n- (5, 4) is 2 steps down from (5, 6) \u2014 not reachable this turn.  \n- (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 6), (2, 6) \u2014 none are adjacent to (5, 6) except (4, 6) if they move LEFT and apple at (4, 3) is not adjacent. Wait, check:  \nAdjacent to (5, 6): (5, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6), (5, 7) but (5, 7) is body so not allowed.  \nNo apple is in those adjacent cells. So enemy cannot eat an apple this turn unless I\u2019m missing something.  \nApples list: (3, 3), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 6), (2, 6). None adjacent to (5, 6).  \n\nSo enemy will not grow this turn. Therefore, no risk of me moving into a cell that becomes enemy body after movement.  \n\n**Closest apple:**  \nFrom (4, 8), closest apple is (3, 6) distance |4-3|+|8-6| = 3.  \nFrom (4, 8), (4, 3) distance 5, (3, 3) distance 6, (5, 4) distance 5, (2, 6) distance 4.  \n\nBest move toward (3, 6):  \n- LEFT (3, 8) \u2192 distance to (3, 6) = 2.  \n- DOWN (4, 7) \u2192 distance = 4.  \n- UP (4, 9) \u2192 distance = 5.  \n- RIGHT (5, 8) \u2192 distance = 4.  \n\nLEFT gets me closest to an apple.  \n\n**Future safety after move:**  \nFrom (3, 8): possible next moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 all likely safe next turn unless enemy approaches. Enemy at (5, 6) likely to move toward apples (5, 4) or (4, 3) or (3, 6). They might move LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5). Either way, they\u2019ll be closer to (3, 6) too.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (3, 7) then (3, 6) to get apple, possibly racing enemy. Enemy\u2019s path to (3, 6): from (5, 6) to (4, 6) to (3, 6) is 2 steps, same as mine from (3, 8) to (3, 7) to (3, 6). So we could arrive at (3, 6) same turn \u2014 head-on collision. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nMaybe better to approach apples from a different route to avoid racing enemy head-on.  \n\n**Alternative:** Move DOWN to (4, 7) to eventually target (4, 3) or (5, 4), while enemy might target (3, 6) or (5, 4).  \n\nBut enemy is longer (length 3), so they might avoid tight spaces.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m length 1, I should avoid head-on risk entirely. Let\u2019s check if moving LEFT risks future head-on at (3, 6):  \nIf enemy goes (5, 6) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (3, 6) in two turns, and I go (4, 8) \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 (3, 6) in three turns, so I\u2019d be one turn behind. Actually my path:  \nTurn 3: (4,8)\u2192(3,8)  \nTurn 4: (3,8)\u2192(3,7)  \nTurn 5: (3,7)\u2192(3,6)  \nEnemy:  \nTurn 3: (5,6)\u2192(4,6)  \nTurn 4: (4,6)\u2192(3,6)  \nSo enemy reaches (3, 6) on turn 4, I\u2019d reach on turn 5 \u2014 so no head-on, but apple gone.  \n\nSo LEFT doesn\u2019t cause head-on, but apple may be eaten before I get there.  \n\n**Better target:** (5, 4) \u2014 enemy might go (5,6)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(5,4) in two turns.  \nFrom (4,8), I could go RIGHT (5,8)\u2192DOWN (5,7)\u2192DOWN (5,6)\u2192DOWN (5,5)\u2192DOWN (5,4) in 4 turns, too slow.  \n\nGiven all this, safest is to avoid enemy and collect apples elsewhere.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove LEFT to (3, 8) to start descending toward left-side apples (3, 3) or (2, 6), while keeping distance from enemy at (5,6). Next turn, go DOWN to (3,7) toward (3,6) if enemy not heading there, else go (3,7)\u2192(2,7)\u2192(2,6) for apple.  \n\nLEFT",

Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 6) (its own body) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 4) (apple) \u2192 allowed, would grow.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5, 4), they eat apple and grow, making their old head (5, 5) become body next turn.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 5), no growth.  \n\nHead-on collision possible if we choose same cell this turn.  \nFrom my (3, 8), enemy at (5, 5) can\u2019t reach any of my possible moves in one step (distance > 1), so no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**Risk of moving into enemy\u2019s future body:**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5, 4) and eats apple, their old head (5, 5) becomes body immediately after movement? Wait, rules: \u201cIf you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\u201d  \nGrowth means a new body segment appears at the old tail position at end of turn, not at old head. So after enemy eats apple, their head is at (5, 4), body is [(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)] (old head becomes first body segment).  \nSo (5, 5) will be enemy body this turn after movement.  \n\nBut none of my moves go to (5, 5), so safe.  \n\n**Closest apples:**  \nFrom (3, 8):  \n- (3, 6): distance 2  \n- (2, 6): distance 3  \n- (3, 3): distance 5  \n- (4, 3): distance 6  \n- (5, 4): distance 6  \n\nBest apple target: (3, 6).  \n\n**Path to (3, 6):**  \nFrom (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 7) next turn, then DOWN to (3, 6) gets apple in 2 turns.  \n\nEnemy path to (3, 6): from (5, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 (3, 6) is 3 steps, or (5, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (3, 6) also 3 steps.  \nI can get there in 2 steps, so I\u2019d beat enemy if I go straight down.  \n\nBut need to check if enemy might cut me off or collide later.  \n\n**Safety after moving DOWN:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7), next turn possible moves: UP (back to 3,8), DOWN (to 3,6 apple), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7).  \nEnemy could be at (5,4) if they ate apple, or at (4,5) if they moved left. From (4,5), they could go to (4,6) next turn, which is adjacent to (3,6) \u2014 so if I go to (3,6) on turn 5, enemy could go to (3,6) same turn from (4,6) \u2192 head-on collision.  \n\nThat\u2019s risky. Maybe better to approach (3,6) from the left side: go LEFT first to (2,8), then down to (2,7), then right to (3,6) \u2014 but that\u2019s 3 steps, enemy might get there first.  \n\nActually, if enemy is at (5,5) now, they are 3 steps from (3,6). If I go DOWN now, I\u2019m 2 steps away. So I\u2019d get there on turn 5, enemy earliest turn 6 (if they move toward it now). So no head-on.  \n\nBut enemy might not even target (3,6) immediately \u2014 they might go for (5,4) apple this turn.  \n\n**Alternative: go for (2,6) apple**  \nFrom (3,8), LEFT to (2,8) \u2192 DOWN to (2,7) \u2192 DOWN to (2,6) in 3 steps.  \nEnemy path to (2,6): (5,5) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (2,6) is 4 steps, so I\u2019d win race.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nI think safest is to move toward closest apple while keeping distance from enemy.  \nDOWN to (3,7) gets me closer to (3,6) and also (2,6) via left later.  \nLEFT to (2,8) also fine but slightly slower to any apple.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN to get closer to apples faster while enemy is still far.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (3,7), assess if enemy is moving toward (3,6). If yes, maybe divert to (2,6) via LEFT then DOWN. If no, go to (3,6) for apple.  \n\nDOWN",

None of my moves go to (5, 4), so safe.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (3, 6) directly below me. If I go DOWN, I eat it immediately this turn, grow next turn (body appears at old head position after movement? Wait: growth means at end of turn, new segment added at tail \u2014 but I have no tail yet, so after eating apple, my head moves to (3, 6) and a body segment appears at (3, 7) \u2014 so next turn my body is [(3, 6), (3, 7)]? Actually careful:  \nSnake growth: when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn. For a length-1 snake, after moving to apple, head at new cell, old head becomes first body segment. So yes, after eating apple, my body will be [(3, 7)] behind head at (3, 6).  \n\nThat\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible apple targets:**  \nEnemy might go for (4, 3) or (3, 3) or (2, 6) eventually. They are 4 steps from (3, 6), so I can eat (3, 6) before they reach it.  \n\n**Future safety after eating (3, 6):**  \nFrom (3, 6) next turn, possible moves: UP (back to 3,7 body), DOWN (3,5 empty), LEFT (2,6 apple), RIGHT (4,6 empty).  \nEnemy could be at (4, 4) or (5, 3) or (6, 4) etc. If enemy is at (4, 4), they could move to (4, 5) or (3, 4) next turn \u2014 not adjacent to my possible moves except maybe (3, 5) if I go DOWN.  \n\nBut I can decide next turn based on enemy position.  \n\n**Alternative moves:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (2, 7), I\u2019m closer to (2, 6) apple (1 step away next turn).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I\u2019m moving away from most apples.  \nIf I go UP to (3, 8), I\u2019m moving away from apples.  \n\nBest is DOWN to eat apple now and grow to length 2, giving more survivability.  \n\n**Potential trap later?**  \nWith length 2, I must avoid moving into my own body next turn. From (3, 6) with body at (3, 7), UP is into my body \u2014 so UP would be invalid next turn. But DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (3, 6), consider going LEFT to (2, 6) to eat another apple if safe, or move toward center to avoid enemy. Enemy is longer, so avoid head-on collisions.  \n\n**Final choice:** DOWN to eat apple and grow.  \n\nDOWN",

They are at (3,3), so central area is risky.  \nLEFT (0,6) keeps me near left edge, away from enemy, but limits future moves (only UP/DOWN/LEFT next turn).  \nUP (1,7) moves toward top-left, still safe, and closer to (2,9) apple.  \nDOWN (1,5) moves toward bottom-left, toward (2,2) and (2,0) apples, but also closer to enemy's possible path.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nI want to collect apples while avoiding enemy. (2,9) is reachable in a few moves if I go UP now.  \nFrom (1,7) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (2,7) then UP to (2,8) then UP to (2,9) \u2014 but need to check if enemy might try for (2,9) too. Enemy at (3,3) is 6 steps away from (2,9), so I can likely get there first if I commit.\n\nLEFT is safe but delays apple collection.  \nUP is safe and progresses toward an apple.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP moves toward apple (2,9), keeps distance from enemy, and from (1,7) I'll have UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT options (RIGHT into (2,7) is safe next turn unless enemy moves there, unlikely).  \n\nI'll go UP.\n\nUP",

Actually, enemy moves simultaneously, so next turn enemy will be elsewhere. But (1, 6) could be enemy body next turn if enemy goes UP then?

So if enemy goes RIGHT, (1, 6) will be enemy body next turn, making my DOWN from (1, 7) invalid next turn.  \n   So DOWN now reduces future options if enemy goes RIGHT.\n\n3. **LEFT (0, 8):**  \n   Next turn moves from (0, 8): UP (0, 9) empty (apple), DOWN (0, 7) empty (but enemy could be at (0, 7) this turn if enemy goes UP), LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 8) body \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).  \n   If enemy goes UP to (0, 7), then my DOWN next turn is into enemy head (if enemy stays) \u2014 but enemy will move again. Actually, if enemy is at (0, 7) next turn, my DOWN to (0, 7) would be head-on if enemy stays, but I can avoid by going UP to (0, 9) to eat apple.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nI want the apple at (0, 9) because it\u2019s closest and enemy is not yet there.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 8) now, next turn I can go UP to (0, 9) to eat it, unless enemy moves to (0, 7) this turn and then to (0, 8) next turn (head-on). But enemy can\u2019t be at (0, 8) next turn from (0, 7) if I\u2019m at (0, 8) \u2014 that\u2019s impossible.  \nActually, if enemy is at (0, 7) next turn, and I\u2019m at (0, 8), enemy could go UP to (0, 8) and cause head-on. So I must check:  \n- Enemy at (0, 6) \u2192 UP to (0, 7) this turn.  \n- Next turn enemy from (0, 7) can go UP to (0, 8) or RIGHT to (1, 7) or DOWN to (0, 6) (body).  \nSo if I\u2019m at (0, 8) next turn, enemy could choose UP into me. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nBetter to go UP now to (1, 9), then LEFT to (0, 9) next turn to get apple while avoiding possible head-on with enemy moving from (0, 7) to (0, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 9), if enemy is at (0, 7), I can go LEFT to (0, 9) safely because enemy can\u2019t reach (0, 9) in one move from (0, 7).

Enemy is at (0, 7) and can go UP to (0, 8) this turn, then next turn could go UP to (0, 9) if I don\u2019t take it now.  \nIf I go LEFT now, I eat apple at (0, 9) and grow to length 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety after each move:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (0, 9) (eat apple):**  \n   Next turn head at (0, 9), length 8, tail at (6, 8) moves forward? Wait, after eating, tail stays until next move? Actually, growth happens immediately: new head at apple, old body stays, tail stays same until next move. So body will be: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)] (length 8).  \n   Next turn from (0, 9):  \n   - UP: off board  \n   - DOWN: (0, 8) \u2192 could be enemy head if enemy goes UP this turn to (0, 8)  \n   - LEFT: off board  \n   - RIGHT: (1, 9) \u2192 my body  \n   So only DOWN is possibly safe, but if enemy is at (0, 8), DOWN is head-on.  \n   That\u2019s risky \u2014 could be trapped if enemy goes UP this turn.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (2, 9):**  \n   Next turn from (2, 9):  \n   - UP: off board  \n   - DOWN: (2, 8) \u2192 my body (segment (2, 8) currently at index 1, but after moving to (2, 9), body becomes [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)] \u2014 wait, let\u2019s check:  \n     Current body: (1, 9) head, then (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8).  \n     Move RIGHT: new head (2, 9), old head (1, 9) becomes segment 2, (1, 8) segment 3, (2, 8) segment 4, etc. So (2, 8) is segment 4, not directly behind head. Actually, after move:  \n     Body: [(2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)] length 7 (no growth).  \n     So DOWN to (2, 8) is occupied by segment 4 \u2014 so invalid.  \n   - LEFT: (1, 9) \u2192 my body (segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \n   - RIGHT: (3, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   So only RIGHT is safe next turn from (2, 9). That\u2019s a dead-end path along top row.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (0, 7) sees apple at (0, 9) two steps away. It may go UP to (0, 8) to get closer. If it does, and I go LEFT to (0, 9), then next turn enemy could go UP to (0, 9) but I\u2019m already there \u2014 but that\u2019s head-on if both move into same cell? No, I\u2019d be stationary at (0, 9), enemy moves into me \u2192 enemy dies (its head hits my body). That\u2019s good for me.  \nBut wait \u2014 if enemy goes UP to (0, 8) this turn, then next turn from (0, 8) enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP to (0, 9) (my head), RIGHT to (1, 8) (my body), DOWN to (0, 7) (its body). So only DOWN is safe for enemy if I\u2019m at (0, 9). So enemy would avoid dying by going DOWN.  \n\nSo LEFT to (0, 9) seems okay: I eat apple, enemy likely avoids me next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Check RIGHT alternative:**  \nRIGHT to (2, 9) avoids enemy entirely but gives only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (3, 9)), then possibly trapped along top edge. Not good long-term.\n\nLEFT seems better: eat apple, grow, and enemy will probably not head-on me next turn because it would die.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn if I go LEFT:**  \nFrom (0, 9) with body length 8, if enemy is at (0, 8), my only safe move is DOWN into (0, 8) \u2014 but that\u2019s enemy head \u2192 head-on. So I must hope enemy moves away from (0, 8) next turn.  \nBut enemy at (0, 8) next turn will likely move DOWN to (0, 7) to avoid hitting me, so (0, 8) becomes free, so I can go DOWN safely. Yes \u2014 if enemy moves DOWN, I can go DOWN into (0, 8) safely after enemy leaves.  \n\nSo LEFT is safe and beneficial.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to eat apple, grow, and force enemy to move away next turn.\n\nLEFT",

So enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (1, 8). If enemy moves RIGHT, then (0, 8) becomes free, but I would move into it simultaneously \u2014 so if enemy moves RIGHT and I move DOWN, we don\u2019t collide. However, if enemy stays still (not allowed \u2014 must move), but they can\u2019t stay still. So if enemy moves RIGHT, I can move DOWN safely. But if enemy moves UP into (0, 9) while I move DOWN into (0, 8), no head-on collision (different cells). Wait, careful: simultaneous moves:  \n  - If enemy moves UP to (0, 9) and I move DOWN to (0, 8), we swap positions, no collision.  \n  - If enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 8) and I move DOWN to (0, 8), I land in empty cell (since enemy left it), safe.  \n  So DOWN is not automatically fatal \u2014 but there\u2019s a risk: if enemy moves UP to (0, 9) and I move DOWN to (0, 8), we\u2019re fine. The only fatal case is if enemy moves DOWN to (0, 7) \u2014 but that\u2019s invalid for them (their own body). So enemy\u2019s valid moves: UP or RIGHT.  \n  So DOWN for me is safe from immediate death.  \n\n- LEFT: off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT: (1, 9) \u2192 my body (segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN only? Wait, check DOWN again: moving into (0, 8) \u2014 enemy head currently there, but enemy will move simultaneously. If enemy moves UP to (0, 9), then (0, 8) is empty when I arrive \u2014 safe. If enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 8), then (0, 8) is empty \u2014 safe. So DOWN is safe.  \n\nBut what about moving into a cell that enemy also moves into? That\u2019s head-on collision only if both heads land in same cell. If I go to (0, 8) and enemy goes to (0, 8), that\u2019s impossible because enemy starts at (0, 8) and can\u2019t stay still. So no risk of head-on at (0, 8).  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn considerations:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (0, 8), my new body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)] length 7 (no apple eaten). Tail (6, 8) disappears.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s move: likely UP to (0, 9) or RIGHT to (1, 8).  \n\nFrom (0, 8) next turn, my possible moves:  \n- UP: (0, 9) \u2014 if enemy went UP this turn, enemy will be at (0, 9) now, so moving UP next turn would be head-on if enemy stays? But enemy will move again simultaneously. Need to think one step ahead, but for now DOWN is only legal move this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI must get apples to catch up (7 vs 10). Closest apple is (3, 5) \u2014 5 steps away. But I\u2019m trapped along top-left currently. After moving DOWN to (0, 8), I\u2019ll be adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible positions. Need to maneuver toward center/apples while avoiding dead ends.  \n\nGiven only one safe move this turn, the choice is forced.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No \u2014 (0,8) is my current head but will be empty after I move \u2014 so yes, enemy can move DOWN safely. So UP is safe for me? Let's check rules:  \n\nRule: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"  \nSo if I go UP to (0,9) and enemy also goes to (0,9) \u2014 impossible because enemy starts at (0,9), it can't stay there (no move \"STAY\").

So (0,9) will be empty after enemy leaves and I arrive \u2014 so UP is safe.  \n\nDOWN: (0,7) is my body segment \u2192 suicide \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT: off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT: (1,8) is enemy body segment \u2192 suicide \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo only UP is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Check again:**  \nEnemy's possible moves from (0,9):  \n- UP: off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN: (0,8) \u2014 empty after I leave \u2192 safe for enemy.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT: (1,9) \u2014 enemy's own body segment at (1,9) \u2192 suicide \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy's only safe move is DOWN to (0,8).  \n\nThus, I can safely go UP to (0,9) because enemy will leave it.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan after this move:**  \nFrom (0,9), next turn I'll have to move DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9) \u2014 but (1,9) is enemy body, so only DOWN is safe. Then from (0,8), again only UP/DOWN? Actually, from (0,8) next turn:  \nUP to (0,9) \u2014 empty? Maybe.  \nDOWN to (0,7) \u2014 my body \u2014 no.  \nLEFT off board \u2014 no.  \nRIGHT to (1,8) \u2014 enemy body \u2014 no.  \nSo only UP is safe \u2014 so I'll be stuck oscillating between (0,9) and (0,8) unless enemy moves its body away. That's a trap.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy will move its body along when it moves DOWN to (0,8) this turn \u2014 so next turn enemy's body will be at [(0,9), (1,9), (2,9), ...]? Let's simulate:  \n\nEnemy head at (0,9), body: [(1,9), (1,8), ...]  \nEnemy moves DOWN to (0,8): new head (0,8), add old head (0,9) to body front, remove tail. New body: [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)] \u2014 tail (6,8) removed.  \n\nSo next turn:  \nMy head at (0,9), enemy head at (0,8).  \nMy possible moves from (0,9):  \nUP: off board \u2192 no  \nDOWN: (0,8) \u2014 enemy head \u2192 potential head-on collision if enemy moves UP to (0,9)? But enemy at (0,8) can move:  \nUP to (0,9) \u2014 my head \u2014 collision if I go DOWN to (0,8)? Let's check: If I go DOWN to (0,8) and enemy goes UP to (0,9), we swap \u2014 no collision. Collision only if we go to same cell. So DOWN for me is safe? Wait, but (0,8) will have enemy's head after enemy moves \u2014 but if enemy moves UP to (0,9), then (0,8) is empty? No \u2014 enemy's body will be behind it. Let's check: If enemy moves UP to (0,9), then its new body includes old head (0,8) \u2014 so (0,8) becomes enemy body \u2014 so if I go DOWN to (0,8), I hit enemy body \u2192 die. So actually, from (0,9) next turn:  \nDOWN \u2192 (0,8) will be enemy body if enemy moves UP, or enemy head if enemy stays? Wait \u2014 next turn enemy head is at (0,8), so possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (0,9) \u2014 then (0,8) becomes enemy body segment \u2192 if I go DOWN to (0,8), I die.  \n- DOWN to (0,7) \u2014 then (0,8) becomes enemy body segment \u2192 if I go DOWN to (0,8), I die.  \n- LEFT off board \u2014 impossible.  \n- RIGHT to (1,8) \u2014 then (0,8) becomes enemy body segment \u2192 if I go DOWN to (0,8), I die.  \n\nSo no matter what enemy does, (0,8) becomes enemy body next turn. So my DOWN from (0,9) is suicide.  \n\nMy RIGHT from (0,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2014 enemy body segment currently? After enemy moves, (1,9) might remain body if enemy moved DOWN? Let's check: enemy body now: [(1,9), (1,8), ...]. If enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), its new body: [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), ...] \u2014 so (1,9) is still body. So RIGHT into (1,9) is suicide.  \n\nSo from (0,9) next turn, no safe moves \u2014 I'll be trapped and die.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** UP leads to certain death next turn.  \n\nBut earlier I thought UP was only safe move \u2014 but if all others are suicide now, and UP leads to death next turn, then I have no escape \u2014 meaning the game might end now.  \n\nWait \u2014 recheck current turn moves:  \nMaybe I missed something: Is RIGHT to (1,8) safe? (1,8) is enemy body segment now \u2192 suicide. Yes.  \nSo indeed only UP is safe this turn, but it traps me next turn.  \n\nSo I must take UP and hope enemy does something that leaves me an out? But enemy's only move is DOWN to (0,8), which indeed traps me.  \n\nSo I'm doomed? Possibly \u2014 unless there's a mistake:  \n\nEnemy's body: [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)]  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), new body: [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)] \u2014 so (1,9) and (1,8) remain body.  \n\nSo indeed from (0,9) next turn, all adjacent cells are off-board or enemy body.  \n\nSo I have no choice but to die next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",
