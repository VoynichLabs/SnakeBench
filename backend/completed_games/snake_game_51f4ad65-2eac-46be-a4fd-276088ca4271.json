From there we can head toward the cluster of apples on the left side (like (2,3), (1,4)) or swing up toward the high\u2011value apples near (0,9) while keeping the opponent in our sights. We want to stay flexible and avoid getting boxed in near the left edge.  \n\n\ud83d\udcad Long\u2011term plan: Keep growing, hug the middle of the board, and set up a trap for Snake #1 by moving toward the (2,3)\u2011(1,4) apple line while watching his head at (8,5).

(7,5) is currently occupied by an apple on the board, so LEFT will grow us by 1 and boost our score now. It also keeps us towards the center-right, maintaining room to pressure the opponent without getting boxed in yet.\n\nShort-term plan: grab the apple, stay mobile, and keep the threat of a cross-field push on the opponent as space permits. Maintain awareness of opponent\u2019s moves to avoid a head-on unless it benefits us (and we\u2019re ahead in apples, which we\u2019re not yet, but this keeps pressure).\n\nLEFT",

We can press growth and keep escape routes open.\n\nEVALUATION OF MOVES (SAFETY FIRST, OUTCOME SECOND):\n- UP to (5,8): Safe. Keeps distance from enemy and opens escape to top area.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Safe. Slightly more aggressive, could intersect future enemy paths; still no immediate threat.\n- DOWN to (5,6): Safe and best immediate gain. Eats apple at (5,6) now, grows length, and we gain momentum. This also opens lines toward other apples without trapping ourselves.\n- LEFT to (4,7): That\u2019s stepping into your own tail. Not safe under current rules here; avoid.\n\nDECISION: DOWN\n- Reasoning: There\u2019s a live apple at (5,6) right in front of you. Eating it grows you to length 3, giving you more board presence. It also keeps two solid escape routes (up or right) and doesn\u2019t box you in yet. It\u2019s the cleanest, most aggressive, growth-first option without increasing collision risk.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (FOR THE NEXT FEW TULLS):\n- After down-eat, solidify the new length and look to push toward additional apples with minimal risk: (7,3), (6,4) or (2,8) as mid-term targets.\n- Maintain two open avenues (up and right) to dodge any late-game box-in by the opponent.\n- If you ever have a lead in apples later, look for head-on opportunities only when the enemy is marching into your lane and you have a guaranteed path.\n\nMOVE PLAN REMINDER (for YOUR FUTURE SELF):\n- Stay aggressive, never lock yourself into a corner, and force head-ons only when it benefits your apple count.\n\nPLAN FOR TURN: DOWN\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s stay ruthless and surgical.\n\nDECISION PROCESS (WHAT WE\u2019RE THINKING OUT LOUD)\n- Consider all four directions from (8,6): UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5), LEFT to (7,6), RIGHT to (9,6).\n- SAFE moves (no instant death): UP (8,7), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6).

It keeps us near the juicy apple cluster around (8,8)/(7,7) and preserves multiple escape routes.\n- Opponent head is far away at (1,1); no immediate head-on risk this turn, so we should push toward growth without taking reckless risks.\n\nWHY UP (8,7) OVER LEFT OR RIGHT\n- Up towards the apple at (8,8) is a clean growth path (and we want to close the apples gap). From (8,7) we can go to (8,8) this turn or next to grab big points.\n- Left to (7,6) would also work and could set up a two-apple sequence via (7,7) and (7,8), but it tightens our corridor slightly and nudges us toward the left cluster that\u2019s a bit more contested.\n- Right to (9,6) risks hugging the edge with fewer immediate fruit lines and offers less flexibility if the board shifts later.\n- Given we\u2019re behind on apples, the priority is to secure safe growth with clear apple targets while staying nimble.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move UP to (8,7) now.\n- Next couple turns: aim for (8,8) to eat that apple, then (7,8) to pick up (7,8) apple, piling apples while staying with multiple exit options.\n- Keep distance from the left-side opponent area to avoid accidental entanglements.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN\n- Stay aggressive but disciplined: use the top-right pocket of the board to farm apples, then pressure the edges to force mistakes.\n- If the opportunity presents a clean head-on collision when we\u2019re even or ahead on apples, take it; otherwise, outgrow and outrun, not collide.\n\nMOVE PLAN\n- MOVE PLAN: UP\n\nup",

Eating them makes a big momentum swing.\n\nWHY UP IS THE PLAY:\n- UP to (8,8) lands on an apple this turn, growing us and getting us deeper into the apple flood.\n- From (8,8) we can next turn pivot to (7,8) to snag the apple there as well, keeping multiple exit routes open.\n- The opponent is nowhere near this pocket, so no head-on risk this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (turn-by-turn vibe):\n- Turn 20: MOVE UP to (8,8) and eat the apple.

Neither is worth the risk.\n\nRECOMMENDED MOVE: LEFT to (6,7) to eat the apple there this turn. That gives you +1 apple, boosting your lead to 9 vs 7 and keeps you in the open pocket for future farming.\n\nWhy LEFT here: you grab a nearby apple, you stay in the top pocket which has multiple escape exits (6,8), (5,7), (6,6), and the opponent is far away so no immediate head-on gambit.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Turn 23 - move LEFT to (6,7) eat. Turn 24 - evaluate the pocket; push toward the next nearby cluster (6,7) or (7,6) depending on apples and opponent moves, always keeping at least two safe exits.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTES: stay aggressive but avoid getting boxed in; watch for any chance to force a head-on when you have a bigger lead.\n\nLET'S DO THIS, LIVE!\nLEFT",

We\u2019re up 9 apples to 7\u2014time to press the advantage and push toward that left apple cluster. Let\u2019s keep it sharp and avoid any cages.\n\nSafe moves from (5,7):\n- UP -> (5,8): safe, keeps north exits open and away from our neck.\n- DOWN -> (5,6): safe, stays central and ready to pivot.\n- LEFT -> (4,7): safe, directly lines up with the left apple cluster at (2,7)/(2,8)/(2,9).\n- RIGHT is forbidden (would hit our neck at (6,7)).\n\nWhy LEFT first? It snakes us toward the left apples and keeps multiple escape routes: (4,8), (5,6), (3,7). It also starts shaping a potential advantage zone in the top-left pocket without boxing us in.\n\nWhy not UP now? It delays growth a bit and nudges us away from the immediate left apple path. DOWN is solid but slows the push toward the left apple group.\n\nPlan short-term: move LEFT now to (4,7), then chain toward (3,7) and (2,7) to grab the left cluster apple and keep open exits to dodge any surprise from Snake #0. Long-term: pressure the left side to force awkward turns from them, maintain freedom to peel back to (5,8) or (4,8) if they swing toward our corridor, and keep the lead with aggressive apple growth.\n\nFinal move decision coming next.

DOWN is disaster (back into our neck).\n- Why UP? There\u2019s an apple at (2,9) right above us, and eating it cleanly increases our lead while extending a vertical corridor. It also gives us top-row leverage to threaten (0,9)/(4,9) apples without getting boxed in.\n- Head-to-head risk: Snake #0 is far at (6,4). No immediate collision threat on the left/top side, so we can push a safe, aggressive alignment without exposing to a trap.\n\nDecision: UP to (2,9) to eat the apple and extend the corridor. This keeps multiple escape routes open (back toward center or along the top) and sets up a future top-left apple push if Snake #0 drifts.\n\nShort-term plan (turns 29-31):\n- Turn 29: Move UP to (2,9), eat apple (now 12 apples). You\u2019ll have a long, narrow vertical spine along x=2 with the tail trailing toward (8,5).\n- Turn 30: From (2,9), go LEFT to (1,9). This starts pressing toward the (0,9) apple and keeps options open for retreat back toward center if needed.\n- Turn 31: If safe and the (0,9) apple is still there, slide LEFT to (0,9) to claim it. If Snake #0 starts shadowing or you sense a trap, pivot back toward the center (1,9) or (2,9) to keep the corridor alive.\n\nLong-term vibe:\n- Maintain the x=2 vertical pressure with flexible exits toward the center. Collect apples to widen the lead and keep the enemy boxed into uncomfortable corridors. If a clean head-on opportunity with Snake #0 pops and the score favors you, you can force it; for now, you\u2019re plus-3 and you want to stay ahead with safe ki\u2014kill pressure.\n\nMove:\nup",

Tightening the top corridor and expanding toward the right gives us more room to threaten future box attempts while keeping distance from Snake #0.\n\nWhy RIGHT now?\n- It extends the topmost wall toward the right edge, reducing immediate room for Snake #0 to slip past from the left.\n- It preserves multiple future safe options (we don\u2019t close ourselves into a corner while still staying lofty and able to chase apples if needed).\n- It creates a potential path to push toward a head-on setup later if Snake #0 dares to cross paths near the top.\n\nLong-term note:\n- Keep pressuring the left flank with careful lateral moves, avoid getting boxed in yourself, and look for chances to force a mutual collision only when you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll win the apple race.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT would hit our neck (illegal).\n\nSafety check:\n- (9,9) and (8,8) are not occupied by either snake\u2019s body.\n- No imminent head-on risk right now; opponent is far left.\n\nApple map merit:\n- There is an apple at (9,9). Eating RIGHT gives an instant lead boost.\n\nPositioning plan:\n- Moving to (9,9) extends the top-right border, creates longer losing-path options for the opponent later, and keeps us out of the dense left-side snake territory.\n- Next, if safe, we can drop to (9,8) to chase the apple there, continuing a controlled growth along the border.\n\nFollow-up tactics:\n- After grabbing (9,9), prioritize safe growth along the right/top edge to prevent tight traps.\n- Maintain distance from Snake #0 and be ready to threaten a head-on only if we have the apples advantage and a clear line.\n\nShort-term safety note:\n- Don\u2019t curve back into your own body; keep options open and avoid isolating yourself in a corner.\n\nDecision: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Time to lock in the next move.  \n\n**Safe moves check**  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) is our own body \u2192 instant death \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (1,5) empty, no apple, but creates a narrow corridor with only one fresh exit  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) empty, no apple, but after moving we lose the ability to go back up (that cell becomes body)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) empty, **opens three fresh exits** (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and sits right next to the (3,4) apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n\n**Long\u2011term vibe**  \nWe want to keep pushing rightward, snag that (3,4) apple, then loop up to grab (1,7) and (1,2) while our length snowballs. A bigger snake = more power to box Snake\u202f#1 into a corner.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move RIGHT \u2192 claim (2,4) and set up a clear path to the (3,4) apple.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn evaluate UP vs DOWN based on board pressure, but always keep at least two safe exits.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Watch Snake\u202f#1\u2019s head; if they start sliding left, we can cut them off from the top.  \n\nLet\u2019s expand aggressively and keep the pressure on!  \nRIGHT",

We want to pressure and start closing space toward the center to box Snake #0 in, while keeping escape routes open.\n\nLong-term vibe: hugging the right border tight already buys us space. Slide left now to dip toward the center, threaten cross-choke points, and keep multiple exit paths open. If he overextends toward the right, we can trap him with a diagonal wall of our body and walls.\n\nNEXT FEW TURNS STRATEGY (short version):\n- Move LEFT now to (8,8), keeping our top-coastal wall intact and shifting the fight toward the center.\n- After that, pivot to create a two-axis constriction with controlled turns, aiming to funnel Snake #0 toward a cage against our own body and the border.\n- Only head-on if we\u2019re certain we\u2019ll maintain more apples than him after the collision.\n\nDECISION:\nMove: LEFT\nLEFT",

Stay aggressive but safe, chase apples judiciously to avoid giving him a head-on collision if it costs you control, and look for opportunities to pin him into a wall or corner as you gain apples and map control.\n\nMove choice (for this turn):\n\nDOWN",
