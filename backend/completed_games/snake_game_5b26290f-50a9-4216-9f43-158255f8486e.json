No apple at (4,1), so tail moves up or forward.\n- Apples still at (5,0), (4,5), (0,8), (7,1), (3,6).\n\n---\n\n**Neighbors of (4,1):**\n\n- UP: (4,2)\n\n  - Your previous body was around row 2 and 3; check if (4,2) is free.\n  - From initial position, (4,2) was your body. But after moving right twice, your body shifted.\n  \n  Let's reconstruct the body:\n\n  Initial body before last move:  \n  Head: (3,1)  \n  Body: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\n  After moving RIGHT (your last move):  \n  The head moves from (3,1) to (4,1), the body follows: the last element (tail) is removed, and the head added.  \n  So body becomes: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] (tail moved forward)\n\n  Now your new head is at (4,1), so \"body excluding head\" is [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)].\n\n  So (4,2) is occupied by your body (unsafe to move UP).\n\n- DOWN: (4,0)\n\n  - Not occupied, apple at (5,0) is adjacent to it.\n  - Safe move.\n\n- LEFT: (3,1)\n\n  - This is where your head was previously located. Is it part of your body now? Body includes (3,1) still (safe?).\n\n  Since your body includes (3,1), moving LEFT back onto your own body is death. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n- RIGHT: (5,1)\n\n  - Check if (5,1) is free.\n\n  No snake or body there; safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the neighbors:**\n\n- UP: (4,2) occupied by your own body, unsafe.\n\n- DOWN: (4,0) free, leads to apple at (5,0).\n\n- LEFT: (3,1) your own body - death if moved there.\n\n- RIGHT: (5,1) free, moves toward apple cluster.\n\n---\n\n**Strategy options:**\n\n1. Move DOWN to get closer to (5,0) apple.\n\n2. Move RIGHT to (5,1) good position for (5,0) and further apples toward (7,1) and (8,1).\n\n3. Avoid LEFT or UP as those positions are unsafe.\n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n\n- DOWN moves closer to the apple (5,0) but leads to some constriction near the \"T\" obstacles.  \n- RIGHT moves closer too, and allows more flexible options next turn.\n\n- Moving RIGHT also does not risk moving into your own body or enemy snake.\n\n---\n\n**My decision:**\n\nMove RIGHT to (5,1) to keep flexibility and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan:**\n\nFrom (5,1), move DOWN to (5,0) to get the apple.\n\n---\n\nFinal move: RIGHT"
