Our best bet is to seize the central ground and threaten multiple escape routes rather than chase him into a corner.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,5) drops us into the board\u2019s middle zone, keeps several follow-up options alive, and doesn\u2019t put us on a collision path with his next likely moves (to (4,7), (3,6), or (3,8)).\n- If he tries to thread toward the top-left corridor, we\u2019ll respond by adapting to keep options open (think (4,5) then (3,5)) to squeeze his space and create a potential isolating line.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTES\n- Keep you alive first; then pressure his movement choices by occupying the central lanes and cutting off backdoor escapes.\n- Avoid locking into a single path; stay flexible so we can pivot if he tries a sudden cross or a trap attempt.\n- Bite at opportunities to grow length when safe and to push him toward edges where his options collapse.\n\nFINAL DECISION\nLEFT",
