A rational enemy loves that move: if we also go UP, heads collide at (5,8) and both die; they win on apples (5 vs our 4, even if both gain +1). This is extremely dangerous.\n- LEFT to (4,7) is safe against the enemy’s best move (RIGHT to 5,8) but still allows a possible head-on at (4,7) if they choose DOWN. That move is strictly worse for them than RIGHT, so it’s less likely, but DOWN doesn’t secure us any apple now and slows our access to the 5,6–6,6 cluster.\n- DOWN to (5,6) is safe against all enemy choices this turn (none of their legal moves land on (5,6)) and immediately eats an apple. From (5,6) next turn we have good, safe access to (6,6) and control over the central apple cluster, while the enemy can safely take (5,8) without interacting with us.\n\nBest move: go DOWN, secure the certain apple at (5,6), and then aim to follow up toward (6,6) if still safe.\n\n**Strategy note for next few turns:**  \nAfter moving to (5,6), prefer taking (6,6) next if no new collision risks appear. Let the enemy keep control of the upper lane near (5,8) rather than racing them head-on; prioritize staying central with multiple escape routes and avoid giving them any chance for a winning head-on.\n\nDOWN",
