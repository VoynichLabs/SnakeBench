But watch out: enemy snake #0's head is at (4,4), possibly moving down or also aiming for (4,3). Collision risk or contest for the apple.\n\n- DOWN to (4,1): my own body is there (was head just before), so it's forbidden (going backwards).\n\n- LEFT to (3,2): empty square, possibly safe to avoid immediate conflict.\n\n- RIGHT to (5,2): empty square.\n\n---\n\nGiven the goal is to get maximum points quickly but not risk death, the best choice is probably to take the apple at (4,3) now. If the enemy snake also wants it and moves down, we have a contest. But I am already closer and can get it first.\n\nAfter getting (4,3), I will reconsider next apples \u2014 potential next target could be (3,4) as it's close and connected.\n\nIf I move UP now to (4,3), I gather a point instantly.\n\n---\n\nTherefore, next move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: After grabbing (4,3), plan a safe path to (3,4), also consider detours if enemy snake is aggressive.\n\n---\n\nMove: UP"
