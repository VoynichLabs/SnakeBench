Checking the board:\n       - There is an apple at (8,1), so moving there is safe and will grow our snake.\n       - No wall, snake, or obstacle is at (8,1).  \n   - After that, our snake will be longer, at least two segments, so future navigation should consider avoiding self-collision.\n\n3. **Next move after reaching the apple:**\n   - Continuing RIGHT from (8,1) would land outside the board at (9,1), which is safe as the board goes from 0 to 9 in both axes.\n   - However, moving further RIGHT would land us at (9,1), not necessarily beneficial unless we're aiming for other apples to the right.\n   - Alternatively, we may want to plan a route to other apples, or stay safe and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Current goals and risks:**\n   - Moving RIGHT to (8,1): safe, directly towards the apple, good choice.\n   - After eating this apple, our snake's length increases, so future paths should be planned carefully.\n   - The main enemy snake is at (5,5), far from our path, so no immediate danger there.\n   - Walls are the boundaries at x=0 and x=9, y=0 and y=9.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Continue moving RIGHT to consume the apple at (8,1).\n- After eating, consider whether to turn up or down toward other apples.\n- For now, ensure path safety.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Next move: RIGHT to collect the apple at (8,1).\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**"
