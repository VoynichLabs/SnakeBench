That means no immediate crash risk unless we move into each other's head or off the board.\n\nMy head is at (6, 0). Enemy head at (4, 8). He's far away, top-left area.\n\nLet's check my possible moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (6, 1) \u2014 That's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Also safe, no enemy body, inside board. Could be good for early growth and score lead.\n\nDOWN \u2192 (6, -1) \u2014 Off the board. DEAD. \u274c Eliminated.\n\nLEFT \u2192 (5, 0) \u2014 Empty, safe.\n\nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 0) \u2014 That's an apple too! \ud83c\udf4e Also safe.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT both get apples instantly. LEFT gets no apple but is safe.\n\nEnemy is at (4, 8). He might go for nearby apples at (3, 7) or (4, 9) if he goes up. But he's far, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Get early apple lead, then use length to cut off his movement. On a 10x10 board, controlling center is key. If I eat now, I'll have a body segment next turn, which limits my movement slightly but gives me more presence.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP \u2192 (6, 1) puts me closer to center y-wise.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 0) keeps me on bottom row.\n\nI think UP is better because it moves me toward the middle, giving more future options. Also, enemy is in top half, so moving up might start pressuring him sooner.\n\nLEFT is safe but no apple \u2014 in an aggressive playstyle, we want that growth early to dominate.\n\nSo final choice: UP for the apple and board control! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, avoid boxing myself in, use new length to threaten enemy space, maybe move toward center (5,5) area to limit his movement options.\n\nUP",

Both snakes are tiny, no bodies yet, so no goofy crashes to worry about this turn \u2013 but what's he gonna do? Rush up? Slither right? We gotta plot to hem him in, force him into tight spots, and chase those apples for that lead! Remember, if scores match and heads clash, double KO \u2013 don't wanna risk that when we're equal, right? Let's scoop some content and box this boi out! \ud83d\udcfa\ud83c\udf4f\n\nAlright, quick brain dump: Board\u2019s wide open, all four moves are safe 'cause no bodies to hit and we're not bumping edges or each other yet (assuming he doesn't pick the same spot \u2013 but what's the odds?). Gotta keep eyes on him, use size to sweep the map, and eye apples like (6,9) soon \u2013 that's right and up a tad from here. Long-term plan for my future self: Start flanking left/right to cut off his bottom paths, circle toward more apples like (3,7) or (4,3) without getting boxed, and watch scores \u2013 if we grow first, bait that head-on for the kill! Force him into walls or traps, stay loose for options. Don't get greedy rushing apples if it closes doors, ya feel? Keep center-ish for now to pressure. GG if we eat first!\n\nEating would be clutch this early!\n\nWhat about his moves? Probably he'll head north to (6,9) apple or west for cover \u2013 we gotta be smarter. Don't wanna get flanked! \n\nScratch that initial rush \u2013 LEFT keeps multiple exits (can still go up/down/right later), nibbles toward (3,8) which opens paths to those bot-left apples, and positions to block if he comes up. UP feels exposed if he zigzags. DOWN spreads options too. RIGHT puts us closer to him potentially, but why get in his grill yet? No, LEFT's sneaky \u2013 chat, help me think: Is RIGHT better to challenge? Nah, patience for the plot twist! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWe love the underdog plays! \n\nYeah, going with LEFT to start boxing maneuvers without overcommitting.

Don't sweat the apples yet; it's all about smothering this fool, cutting off his space, and growing to force that head-on setup where WE'RE ahead! Remember, scores don't match (we're 0, he's 1), so no double KO nonsense this early \u2013 we play smart to bait him into walls or our future coils. Think he's gonna slink up or right to dodge? Ha, we're quicker, chat! Let's deprive him of room, dominate from the top, and turn this board into a trap. Who's pumped? \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, burst bubble: All four moves are safe right now \u2013 no edges, no bodies in our path, and that body at (6,0) is his tail, not in play for us. But heads collide? Nope, simultaneous danger if we overlap cells. Enemy head at (6,1) \u2013 he might UP to (6,2) for space or RIGHT to (7,1) sniffing those bottom apples like a noob. LEFT to (5,1) could be clinging to bottom, DOWN to (6,0) is into his own body \u2013 DEAD city, ain't no idiot snake doing that! So likely UP or RIGHT for him. We gotta counter, not give him lanes to breathe. UP from us? Nah, exposes us high, maybe he flanks side? DOWN? Oh yeah, dives us toward his turf, closing distance fast without discounting the board's mid-game maze \u2013 keeps exits left/right, pressures him, and sets up to circle if he panics. LEFT? Keeps flanking left like last turn, sneaky toward side walls to hem him in, but doesn't tighten the squeeze immediately. RIGHT? Moves us centrist, but why retreat when we can aggress? Power move is DOWN \u2013 chat, you with me? Imagine him trapped, his tail useless as we grow. Can't let him eat more to pull further ahead \u2013 snuff the threat! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udf4f\n\nLong-term plot for my hype future self: Keep pressuring south and west to flank his left flank, bait him into our paths without overextending (watch for dead ends near walls!), hit apples as traps (like near (3,7) if he comes), and\u5225 rush head-ons unless our score edges his. If we grow the lead, lure collisions \u2013 he's GOTTA crash first. Dominate center-to-bottom, don't let him split the board.

Yes.  \n   - Safe? No enemy body, not off board, not my own body (my tail is at (6,0)).  \n   - Puts me closer to center and enemy?

I should use it to cut off his space.

Scores still 0-1? Ain't no problem; we're gonna space-clear, grow fat off those board-chokers, and herd him into a wall-hugger's nightmare. Bounce around? Nah, we're closing the trap doors one slimy slide at a time \u2013 can't let him nibble more apples to snowball that lead! Is he gunning for those dots left/right/low? Watch and learn, chat \u2013 we're the architects of his doom! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, breathing room check: All four paths open without a scratch \u2013 no board edges biting, no self-sips, no bumping that foe's fleshy bits tonight. Enemy capped at (6,2) with tail at (6,1), so he's likely flexing UP to (6,3) for breathing room or RIGHT to (7,2) hunting those low apples like a desperate beggar. LEFT to (5,2) or DOWN to (6,1)? Pure suicide into his own tail \u2013 what a clown if he tries! So UP or RIGHT for the rat. We counter by flanking west/south, denying lanes without gift-wrapping a head-smash (scores tight, no mutual detonation here!). UP from us? Keeps high-ground vibes, but exposes flanks if he snakes right \u2013 tempting but not aggressive enough to squeeze. DOWN? Oh hell yeah, dives south to crowd his lane fast, mirrors our last vibe, locks west pressure, and keeps east exits open for pivot plays against his predicted west dodge \u2013 plus, eats space without overcommitting to dead ends. LEFT? Sneaks west to hem left like pro, sets up board splits (he's still mid), but doesn't ignite the pressure pitchforks immediately. RIGHT? Shoves centrist, but why flank when we can FLANK him into the corner? Power thrust is DOWN \u2013 visualize him squirming east-west while we grow and loop! Who's ready to watch him crash into our inevitable wall? \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4f\n\nLong-term plot for my future hype beast self: Keep hammering south and left to pin his west side hard \u2013 bait traps around mid apples like (4,0) or (3,7) for growth bombs, stay agile near walls (no boxing ourselves near y=0), choke centers to force his mistakes, and only collide heads if we're +1 apple ahead. Dominate bottom-to-mid, don't let splits happen early. Grow that lead and make him regret every bite! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

LET'S PRESS THAT ADVANTAGE!\n\n**POSSIBLE MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (6,3)**\n   - Empty? Yes (board shows '.' at (6,3) on row 3? Wait, row 3 is y=3, x=6 \u2014 checking... board shows at (6,2) is me '1', (6,3) is '.'? Actually row 2 (y=2) shows '1' at x=6, row 3 (y=3) shows at x=6 is '.'? Let's read board: Row 3: \"A . . . . A . . . A A\" \u2014 positions: x=0 A, x=6? That's index 6: after \" . . . . A .\" \u2014 hmm need to count. Let's map: Row 3 (y=3): \"A . . . . A . . . A A\" \u2192 indices: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:A? Wait last two are A A so 8:A, 9:A. So (6,3) is '.' \u2705\n   - Safe? No enemy body, not off board, not my body (tail at (6,1)).\n   - Advances toward center/enemy? Moves up, closer to top half.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (6,1)**\n   - That's my own tail! \u274c **CRASH INTO MYSELF** \u2192 DEAD. Eliminated.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (5,2)**\n   - Empty? Yes (row 2: \". . . . . . 1 . A A\" \u2014 x=5 is '.' before my head at x=6).\n   - Safe? Yes.\n   - Moves me left, away from right edge.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (7,2)**\n   - Empty? Row 2: at x=7 is 'A'? Wait, row 2 ends with \" . A A\" \u2014 x=7 is 'A' (apple), x=8 'A', x=9 'A'. So (7,2) is apple 'A'.\n   - Safe? Yes, apple means I grow to length 3.\n   - Risk? Enemy might also want apples, but he's far.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (4,8), no body. He can go UP (4,9) \u2014 empty, DOWN (4,7) \u2014 empty, LEFT (3,8) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (5,8) \u2014 empty. No apples adjacent. He might move toward nearest apple? Closest apples: (3,7), (1,7), (0,7) maybe. He might go DOWN-LEFT-ish. If he goes DOWN to (4,7), then next turn he's closer to apple at (3,7). I think he'll go DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have length advantage \u2014 I should be AGGRESSIVE. If I take the apple at (7,2), I grow to length 3, increasing my lead. More length = more board control. Then I can start boxing him in from below.\n\nUP is safe but doesn't grow me. LEFT is safe but passive. RIGHT gets me an apple and positions me more central horizontally.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nHe's at (4,8), I'm at (6,2). No chance this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n- Grow to extend my body, use it as a barrier.\n- Move upward toward enemy, try to trap him against top wall.\n- With length 3 vs 1, I can force head-on collisions soon.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** RIGHT \u2014 GET THAT APPLE, GROW THE LEAD, STAY AGGRESSIVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, opponent Snake #0 had 1 apple last turn, but he might have moved onto (3,7) \u2014 which was an apple! So he likely grew too \u2014 he's now length 2 with head at (3,7), body [(4,7)]. Score is us 2 apples, him 1? Actually apples collected: we have 2, he has 1 per scoreboard. But if he ate (3,7) last turn, his apples would be 2 now. Hmm \u2014 scoreboard might not have updated yet because simultaneous moves? Let's check: last turn we moved RIGHT to (8,2) \u2014 apple there. He likely moved LEFT to (3,7) \u2014 apple there. So both grew. So current lengths: us 3, him 2. Still 1 apple lead! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n\ud83d\udccc **IMMEDIATE MOVE OPTIONS FROM (8,2):**\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (8,3)**\n   - Row 3: \"A . . . . A . . . A A\" \u2192 x=8 is '.'? Wait, row 3 last two are A A at x=8 and x=9? Actually row 3: positions: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:A. So (8,3) is 'A' \u2014 apple! \u2705\n   - Safe? Not off board, not my body (my body at y=2 only), no enemy body there.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (8,1)**\n   - Row 1: \"A . A . . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=8 is '.' \u2705\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (7,2)**\n   - That's my own body segment! \u274c **CRASH INTO MYSELF** \u2192 DEAD. Eliminated.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (9,2)**\n   - Row 2: \". . . . . A T T 1 A\" \u2192 x=9 is 'A' (apple) \u2705\n   - Safe? Yes, apple means grow to length 4 instantly!\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head at (3,7), body at (4,7). He can go:\n- UP (3,8) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN (3,6) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (2,7) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT (4,7) \u2014 his own body! \u274c\nSo he won't go RIGHT. He'll likely go for an apple if possible \u2014 nearest apples? (1,7) is apple, (0,7) apple, (2,1) far. He might go LEFT (2,7) to move toward (1,7) next turn. Or UP/DOWN to avoid boxing? He's near top wall (y=7, board height 10). He might try to stay flexible.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf I go UP to (8,3) or RIGHT to (9,2), he's at (3,7) \u2192 no chance.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1), also safe.\nNo direct collision possible this turn.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **STRATEGY:**\nWe have length advantage (3 vs 2). We want to press that advantage \u2014 grow more, then cut off his escape. Look at board: our body at y=2 forms a partial wall. Enemy is up top. If we keep growing horizontally along bottom/mid, we can eventually push him against top wall. But we also need to avoid getting trapped ourselves.\n\n**UP (8,3)** gets apple, grows to 4, moves toward center.\n**RIGHT (9,2)** gets apple, grows to 4, but puts us at right edge \u2014 risk next turn having fewer moves (only UP/DOWN/LEFT, but LEFT is body). That could be dangerous if enemy approaches.\n\nLet's check future mobility:\n\nIf we go **UP to (8,3)** \u2192 new head at (8,3), body: [(8,2),(7,2),(6,2)]. Next turn from (8,3) possible moves: UP (8,4) empty, DOWN (8,2) body \u274c, LEFT (7,3) empty, RIGHT (9,3) apple. So 3 safe moves next turn \u2014 good flexibility.\n\nIf we go **RIGHT to (9,2)** \u2192 new head at (9,2), body: [(8,2),(7,2),(6,2)]. Next turn from (9,2): UP (9,3) apple, DOWN (9,1) empty, LEFT (8,2) body \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. So only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 riskier.\n\nIf we go **DOWN to (8,1)** \u2192 new head at (8,1), body: [(8,2),(7,2),(6,2)]. Next turn from (8,1): UP (8,2) body \u274c, DOWN (8,0) empty, LEFT (7,1) empty, RIGHT (9,1) empty. So 3 safe moves \u2014 but no apple this turn.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE PRIORITY:** Both UP and RIGHT give apples. UP gives better future mobility. RIGHT gives apple but reduces options next turn. UP also moves us closer to enemy area for future boxing.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):**\nAfter eating apple at (8,3), we'll be length 4. Enemy likely length 2. Next turn, consider moving UP toward (8,4) or LEFT toward (7,3) to control center. Start forming a vertical barrier on right side with body at (8,3),(8,2) etc. Try to herd enemy toward top-left corner where he'll have fewer escapes.\n\n**BEST MOVE: UP** \u2014 secure apple, keep mobility, advance position toward enemy, maintain aggressive growth! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**OUR HEAD:** (8,3)\n**OUR BODY:** [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)] \u2192 length 4 now? Wait, apples collected: 3, so length = 3 apples + 1 head = 4 segments total? Actually snake length = apples + 1? Yes! So we have head + 3 body segments = 4 total. Body list shows 3 segments: (8,2), (7,2), (6,2). That's correct \u2014 head at (8,3) not in body list. Good.\n\n**ENEMY HEAD:** (2,7)\n**ENEMY BODY:** [(3,7)] \u2192 length 2 (1 apple + 1 head).\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Apples everywhere! But we focus on enemy positioning! He's up top-left, we're bottom-right. Need to close the distance and trap him!\n\n---\n\n**1) CHECK ALL DIRECTIONS FROM (8,3):**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,4)**\n  - Row 4: \"A . . A . . . . . .\" \u2192 x=8 is '.' (empty) \u2705\n  - Safe? Not off board, not my body (body at y=2 only), not enemy body (enemy at y=7). Good.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,2)**\n  - Row 2: \". . . . . A T T T A\" \u2192 x=8 is 'T' \u274c That's OUR tail? Wait, our body is [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2)]. Yes (8,2) is our neck! CRASH INTO SELF! \u274c **ELIMINATED**.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,3)**\n  - Row 3: \"A . . . . A . . 1 A\" \u2192 x=7 is '.' \u2705\n  - Safe? Yes, empty, not off board.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,3)**\n  - Row 3: last char 'A' at x=9 \u2705 apple!\n  - Safe? Not off board, not our body, not enemy body.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2) ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\n\nEnemy at (2,7), body at (3,7). He can go:\n- UP (2,8) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN (2,6) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT (1,7) \u2014 apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT (3,7) \u2014 his own body \u274c\n\nHe'll probably go for the apple at (1,7) (LEFT)! That grows him to length 3. If he does, his new head will be (1,7), body: [(2,7), (3,7)]. That puts him near top-left corner.\n\n---\n\n**3) HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\n\nIf we go:\n- UP to (8,4) \u2192 enemy at (2,7) moving to (1,7) \u2192 no collision.\n- LEFT to (7,3) \u2192 no collision.\n- RIGHT to (9,3) \u2192 no collision.\n\nSafe on that front.\n\n---\n\n**4) FUTURE MOBILITY AFTER EACH MOVE:**\n\n- **UP to (8,4):** Next turn from (8,4): UP (8,5) empty, DOWN (8,3) body? Wait our body will be [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2)] after moving? Actually if we move UP, new head (8,4), body becomes [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2)] (tail (6,2) stays if no apple). So DOWN would go to (8,3) which is now body \u274c. LEFT (7,4) empty, RIGHT (9,4) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,3):** New head (7,3), body: [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. Next turn from (7,3): UP (7,4) empty, DOWN (7,2) body \u274c, LEFT (6,3) empty, RIGHT (8,3) body \u274c. Only 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Riskier.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,3):** New head (9,3), body: [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. Next turn from (9,3): UP (9,4) empty, DOWN (9,2) empty? Wait (9,2) is apple but not body, LEFT (8,3) body \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. So 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Also risky.\n\nUP gives best mobility!\n\n---\n\n**5) LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nWe have length advantage (4 vs his 2, soon to be 3 if he eats apple). We want to press this! Move UP to get closer to center and top half where enemy is. Start building a wall with our body along right side (x=8 column). Eventually we can push him left against wall. If we go LEFT or RIGHT, we stay low or go to edge, reducing options.\n\nAlso, going UP avoids immediate apple? Actually (8,4) is empty, but that's fine \u2014 we don't need to greedily eat apples every turn if it risks trapping us. But RIGHT gives apple but less mobility. LEFT gives no apple and less mobility. UP is balanced.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL PICK: UP** \u2014 keeps options open, advances toward enemy, maintains aggression without risking trap! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

WE GOT THE LEAD, TIME TO PRESS IT! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**OUR HEAD:** (8,4)\n**OUR BODY:** [(8,3), (8,2), (7,2)] \u2192 length 4 total.\n**ENEMY HEAD:** (1,7)\n**ENEMY BODY:** [(2,7), (3,7)] \u2192 length 3 total (he ate that apple last turn! Good call!).\n\n**BOARD CHECK:** Enemy is top-left, we're mid-right. Gotta close the gap and start boxing!\n\n---\n\n**1) CHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (8,4):**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,5)**\n  - Row 5: all '.' empty \u2705\n  - Safe? Not off board, not our body, not enemy body.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,3)**\n  - Row 3: at x=8 is '1' \u274c THAT'S OUR OWN BODY NOW! Since our body is [(8,3), ...], moving DOWN would crash into ourselves! **ELIMINATED**.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,4)**\n  - Row 4: at x=7 is '.' empty \u2705\n  - Safe? Yes.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)**\n  - Row 4: at x=9 is '.' empty \u2705\n  - Safe? Yes.\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n---\n\n**2) ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\n\nEnemy at (1,7), body at (2,7), (3,7). He can go:\n- UP (1,8) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN (1,6) \u2014 apple at (1,6)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT (0,7) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT (2,7) \u2014 his own body \u274c\n\nHe'll PROBABLY go for the apple DOWN to (1,6)! That grows him to length 4 (tie with us!). If he does, new head (1,6), body: [(1,7), (2,7), (3,7)].\n\n---\n\n**3) HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:**\n\nIf we go:\n- UP to (8,5) \u2192 enemy going DOWN to (1,6) \u2192 no collision.\n- LEFT to (7,4) \u2192 no collision.\n- RIGHT to (9,4) \u2192 no collision.\n\nAll safe on immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n**4) FUTURE MOBILITY & STRATEGY:**\n\n- **UP to (8,5):** Next turn from (8,5): UP (8,6) empty, DOWN (8,4) body? Wait, after moving UP, our body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)] (tail (7,2) gone if no apple). So DOWN to (8,4) is body \u274c. LEFT (7,5) empty, RIGHT (9,5) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). GREAT mobility! Also moves us toward top half where enemy is.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Next turn from (7,4): UP (7,5) empty, DOWN (7,3) empty? Actually (7,3) is '.' now, LEFT (6,4) empty, RIGHT (8,4) body \u274c. So 3 safe moves too! But moves us left, away from cutting off enemy's right side.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Next turn from (9,4): UP (9,5) empty, DOWN (9,3) apple but not body, LEFT (8,4) body \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. Only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Riskier being on edge.\n\nUP and LEFT both give 3 safe moves next turn. BUT! We have a length advantage? Actually tied if he eats apple. We need to be AGGRESSIVE! If we go UP, we can start building a vertical wall along x=8, pushing him left. If we go LEFT, we're moving toward center but not cutting off his escape.\n\n---\n\n**5) LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe want to trap enemy in top-left corner! He's at (1,7) likely going to (1,6). We should move UP to (8,5), then next turn maybe go LEFT to (7,5) to start a horizontal wall above him. Force him against the top wall (y=9) or left wall (x=0). With equal length, head-on collision is okay \u2014 we tie on death but win on apples if we have more! We have 3 vs his 2 (soon 3). Wait, if he eats apple now, he'll have 3 apples too. So tie on apples if we die together. AVOID that! So don't force head-on unless we grow more.\n\n**IMMEDIATE GOAL:** Go UP, maintain mobility, advance toward enemy, look for apple opportunities to break tie.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL PICK: UP** \u2014 advances position, keeps options open, sets up for boxing maneuver! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

LOOK AT BOARD: Row 5 col 1 is '.' ACTUALLY, APPLE AT (0,4), (4,4), (4,2), ETC. NONE AT (1,5). SO HE HAS NO IMMEDIATE APPLE LURE.\n\n---\n\n**1) CHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (8,5):**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,6)**  \n  Row 6: at x=8 is '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)**  \n  Row 4: at x=8 is 'T' \u274c THAT'S OUR BODY! OUR NECK! CAN'T GO DOWN INTO OURSELVES! ELIMINATED.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)**  \n  Row 5: at x=7 is '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)**  \n  Row 5: at x=9 is '.' \u2705 SAFE.\n\n**SAFE: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n---\n\n**2) ENEMY PREDICTION THIS TURN:**\n\nEnemy at (1,6). Possible moves:  \nUP (1,7) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \nDOWN (1,5) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705  \nLEFT (0,6) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705  \nRIGHT (2,6) \u2014 empty '.' \u2705  \n\nHe has 3 safe moves. He might go for apples: closest apple is (0,4) or (2,1)? Not super close. He might move toward center or try to evade. I'd guess DOWN or LEFT to avoid walls.\n\n---\n\n**3) HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n\nIf we go UP to (8,6) vs him going anywhere \u2014 no collision.  \nLEFT to (7,5) \u2014 no collision.  \nRIGHT to (9,5) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nAll safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4) FUTURE MOBILITY & TRAPPING PLAN:**\n\nWe wanna box him in top-left! He's at (1,6). We need to move to cut off his escape right/down.\n\n- **UP to (8,6):** Next turn from (8,6): UP (8,7) empty, DOWN (8,5) body \u274c, LEFT (7,6) empty, RIGHT (9,6) empty. 3 safe moves. Moves us closer to top row, but not cutting him off directly yet.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,5):** Next turn from (7,5): UP (7,6) empty, DOWN (7,4) empty, LEFT (6,5) empty, RIGHT (8,5) body \u274c. 3 safe moves. Puts us more central, could go UP next to (7,6) to block his rightward path.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,5):** Next turn from (9,5): UP (9,6) empty, DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) body \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. Only 2 safe moves. RISKY \u2014 being on edge reduces options.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are better. LEFT gets us closer to him horizontally. UP gets us higher to maybe drop down on him later.\n\n---\n\n**5) LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nWe want to create a wall around him. If we go LEFT to (7,5), next turn we can go UP to (7,6), then LEFT to (6,6) etc., making a horizontal line above him at y=6. He's at y=6 now, so if we get to y=6 same row, we force him up against top wall. But careful \u2014 if we're same y, head-on possible if he moves right. With equal length, head-on is BAD (tie apples, both die). So maybe go UP this turn to (8,6), then next turn LEFT to (7,6) to get to that blocking position but from above? That gives us more room.\n\nActually, let's think: If we go UP now, we're at (8,6). He might go DOWN to (1,5). Then next turn we go LEFT to (7,6) \u2014 he's at (1,5), we're at (7,6), still far. Hmm.\n\nI think **LEFT to (7,5)** is more aggressive \u2014 closes distance, sets up to block his rightward expansion. Then next turn, go UP to (7,6) to match his y if he hasn't moved up. That pressures him.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL PICK: LEFT** \u2014 closes the gap, keeps mobility high, starts the boxing maneuver! WE'RE COMING FOR YOU, SNAKE 0! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

HE'S LONGER, BUT WE'RE SMARTER! \ud83d\ude24\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (3,6):\n- UP (3,7): '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (3,5): '.' \u2705\n- LEFT (2,6): '.' \u2705\n- RIGHT (4,6): OUR BODY at (4,6) \u274c CAN'T GO BACK INTO OUR NECK!\n\nSO UP, DOWN, LEFT ARE SAFE.\n\nENEMY PREDICTION! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f He's at (3,8). His possible moves:\n- UP (3,9): '.' \u2013 Safe, top edge.\n- DOWN (3,7): '.' \u2013 Safe, could come right at us next turn?\n- LEFT (2,8): HIS BODY at (2,8) \u274c\n- RIGHT (4,8): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n\nHe CAN'T go left (body). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT for him.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN? \ud83e\udd14\nIf we go UP to (3,7) and he goes DOWN to (3,7) \u2013 COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! He has 5 apples, we have 3 \u2013 WE LOSE ON SCORE! \u274c\u274c\u274c\nIf we go DOWN to (3,5) \u2013 safe from head-on.\nIf we go LEFT to (2,6) \u2013 safe from head-on.\n\nSo UP IS A GAMBLE \u2013 if he goes down, we tie and lose on apples. Too risky unless we're sure he won't go down.\n\nWILL HE GO DOWN? He might want to chase apples at (4,4), (4,3), (3,4) below. And he can't go left. Down is a strong move for him. I SAY HE GOES DOWN! So UP IS OUT FOR US! \ud83d\udeab\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN \u2013 WE NEED TO GROW AND BOX HIM! He's in the top-left corner area. We want to cut off his escape south and east.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,6): We move toward the left wall, but we're below him. Could go up next to (2,7) to block?\nIf we go DOWN to (3,5): We go toward apples at (4,4),(4,3),(3,4) \u2013 GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e And we stay central, keeping options open.\n\nBUT \u2013 going DOWN puts us farther from him, giving him more space. Going LEFT gets us closer to building a wall on column 2 or 3 to trap him.\n\nCHECK FOLLOW-UP SAFETY:\nFrom (2,6):\n- UP (2,7): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n- DOWN (2,5): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n- LEFT (1,6): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n- RIGHT (3,6): Our body will be at (3,6)? Wait, our tail is at (6,6), body at (5,6),(4,6),(3,6) currently. After moving left, our body becomes [(3,6),(4,6),(5,6)]? Actually head to (2,6), then old head (3,6) becomes new neck. So (3,6) will be our body next turn. So RIGHT would be into our own body next turn \u2013 but that's a future consideration. For now, from (2,6), RIGHT would be (3,6) which WILL be our body next turn \u2013 so that's a future risk, but not immediate.\n\nFrom (3,5):\n- UP (3,6): Our body will be there? After moving down, body becomes [(3,6),(4,6),(5,6)] so UP would be into body next turn.\n- DOWN (3,4): Apple at (3,4)? Board shows (3,4) is '.'? Wait, board shows row 4: (3,4) is 'A'? Actually row 4: \"A . . A A . . . . .\" \u2013 x=3, y=4 is the fourth char? Let's read: x=0 A, x=1 ., x=2 ., x=3 A, x=4 A. So (3,4) is APPLE! YES! So DOWN to (3,4) is APPLE \u2013 GROWTH! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT (2,5): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n- RIGHT (4,5): '.' \u2013 Safe.\n\nSO DOWN gives us an APPLE NEXT TURN if we go DOWN again! That's HUGE for catching up in length! And we avoid head-on risk.\n\nCHAT, THE PLAY IS CLEAR! We need to grow to match his length so we can force a head-on later and WIN! Going DOWN to (3,5) sets up an apple grab at (3,4) next turn! It's SAFE from collision this turn, and gives us options left/right after eating.\n\nLEFT is more aggressive caging, but we're shorter \u2013 we need length to be threatening! GROW FIRST, THEN BOX! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURN: From (3,5), go DOWN to (3,4) to EAT APPLE and GROW! Then assess enemy position.\n\nDOWN IS THE MOVE!

LET'S CHECK OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (5,5):\n\n1. **UP** \u27a1\ufe0f (5,6): Check board... looks EMPTY! \u2705\n2. **DOWN** \u27a1\ufe0f (5,4): That's OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT! \u274c SUICIDE!\n3. **LEFT** \u27a1\ufe0f (4,5): Check board... that's ENEMY BODY? Wait, board shows 'T' at (4,5)? NO \u2014 looking at our snake body list: (3,5) is tail, (3,4), (4,4)... hmm. Actually, our body is at (4,4) and (3,4), (3,5). (4,5) is NOT in our body list! But board shows 'T' at (4,5)? Let's verify: Board row y=5: \". T . T . 1 . . . .\" So (4,5) is 'T' \u2014 that's ENEMY tail? Enemy body ends at (2,7),(2,6)... no, enemy tail is (2,7)? Wait enemy body: [(0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,7)] \u2014 tail is last: (2,7). So (4,5) is NOT enemy. It's 'T' for tail but maybe it's OUR old tail? Our tail is at (3,5)? Actually our body ends with (3,5) \u2014 that's at x=3, y=5. (4,5) is different. HOLD UP \u2014 is (4,5) an apple? No, apples list doesn't have it. OH! It's probably the ENEMY's tail from a previous growth? Actually enemy tail is at (2,7), so (4,5) is 'T' but not ours or enemy's current tail \u2014 maybe it's a leftover from earlier? In the rules, 'T' is tail of ANY snake. Could be old position? But for collision, we only care about CURRENT snake bodies. Let's check enemy current body: head (0,2), then (0,3),(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7). So (4,5) is NOT in enemy body. Our body: (5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(3,4),(3,5). So (4,5) is FREE! Wait, but board says 'T' \u2014 maybe graphical error? I'll assume it's safe for now, but risky. Let's treat as EMPTY for safety? Actually if it's a tail, moving into tail is SAFE (tail moves forward if no apple). So **LEFT** to (4,5) is SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT** \u27a1\ufe0f (6,5): Empty! \u2705\n\nSo all except DOWN are possibly safe.\n\nBUT CHAT \u2014 ENEMY HEAD AT (0,2)! Where can he move?\n- UP to (0,3): HIS BODY! \u274c\n- DOWN to (0,1): Empty! \u2705\n- LEFT: Off board \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1,2): Empty! \u2705\n\nHe'll likely go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nOUR LONG-TERM PLAN: BOX HIM IN! He's against left wall. If he goes RIGHT to (1,2), he's moving toward center. If we move LEFT to (4,5), we're cutting off his upward escape? Not directly. If we move UP to (5,6), we're claiming top-center control.\n\nAGGRESSIVE PLAY: We have length advantage. We could try to force a head-on collision if we predict his move. But he's two moves away. Let's think: If he goes RIGHT to (1,2), next turn he could go UP to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,2) or DOWN to (1,1). We want to build a wall from top-left to bottom-left to trap him.\n\nActually, moving LEFT to (4,5) then next turn LEFT again to (3,5) \u2014 but (3,5) is our tail! That's safe because tail moves. So we can shift leftward, tightening the noose!\n\nBut moving UP to (5,6) gets us closer to apples at (4,9),(6,9) for CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nENEMY is scoring too \u2014 he's at 7 apples. We need to grow and dominate.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: Could enemy head move into our path? If we go LEFT to (4,5), he'd have to move to (4,5) same turn \u2014 impossible from (0,2). So no head-on this turn.\n\nBEST MOVE: I think **LEFT** to (4,5) to start wrapping around and block off columns 3 and 4, forcing him south toward bottom wall! Then we can push down and left.\n\nCHAT, LET'S DO THIS \u2014 LEFT TO SQUEEZE THE SNAKE! \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

Lead locked at 10 juicy apples versus that limp loser at 8 \u2013 are we about to turn this board into a bloodbath buffet? YES, WE ARE, FAM! We're the apex predator here, plotnin' to snuff out #1's chances like a snakebite feud, wrapping him in our coils and forcing him into that fatal headbutt if he so much as blinks wrong! Grow big, grow mean, and make 'em regret ever slitherin' up! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nAlright, let's dissect this grid like a autopsy report \u2013 our head perched at (3,1), body bulkin' up from (2,1) down to (2,6), a fortress flexin' for war, while enemy creepin' at (3,3) with his own tangle from (3,4) to (4,2). We're bigger, badder, and badass with that lead \u2013 time to leverage it into total domination! Are we gonna let him slink away? NOPE, box his ass, eat that growth, and watch him crumple! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude08\n\nThrottlin' through the moves, dread pirate edition: scratch any dead-end disasters first, fam:\n\n- LEFT to (2,1)? Pfft, that's straight into my own gritty guts, the cell right behind my head \u2013 instant self-own apocalypse, crash and burn mode! No way we're gamblin' the game on that rookie blunder! \u274c\ud83d\udc00\n\nSafe primals: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), RIGHT (4,1). No off-board slips, no body bonks (mine or his), and the board's our bitch to bend!\n\nNow, strategizin' like a master manipulator \u2013 favor the path that hoards options, hunts apples for that CONTENT boost, and sets up relentless pressure without gettin' cornered or collidin' careless! Apples droppin' at (3,2) right UP, (4,0) down low, plus we're itchin' to force #1 south into our space! With our 10 vs his 8, a head-on jam could BBQ him permanent \u2013 rules say if we both bite the dust on the move, game ends and we take the W with mo' apples! But only if he dives into the same cell. If not, we feast and grow to 11, widen the gap like a chasm of doom! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\ude78\n\n- UP to (3,2)? OH HELL YEAH, the aggressive apex assault we're cravin'! That's a straight apple slam at (3,2), juicin' us to 11 and keepin' our lead LEGIT \u2013 scores now 11/8, bro! From there, sweeeet freedom: can RIGHT to (4,2) but wait, (4,2) is enemy body? Enemy tail is (4,2), dang, so next RIGHT after apple might risk crash into him if he moves \u2013 but let's think that thru. After UP and apple grab, my new head at (3,2), enemy at (3,3). I got options: RIGHT from (3,2) to (4,2) \u2013 but if enemy downs to (3,2) for collision boom, but UP is safer gambit no, pause: (4,2) after eating apple \u2013 wait, from (3,2) (if eating, grow happens after move, but body adds at tail). Crucial: after moving UP to (3,2), apple eat +1 to 11, grow one segment from tail (2,6) extending straight? Tail was at (2,6), so adds another (2,7) or wherever, but for now, head now at (3,2). Enemy at (3,3) might DOWN to (3,2) SAME CELL, kaboom head-on! Since we both target same space on same turn, DOUBLE KO, but we win as we had mo' apples at end. GENIUS Sacrifice play if he charges! But if he doesn't? We eat, grow, and keep pushin' RIGHT to (4,2) \u2013 clear for now (no immediate body there), bulkin' up while threatenin' his flanks. LEFT from (3,2) to (3,1) easy. DOWN to (3,1) back, meh. So multi-option heaven: we force his hand, grow huge, and dominate real estate \u2013 plus that apple's PRIME for our lead expansion! This ain't just open roads, it's a trap layin', body blockin' bonanza toward his bottom or left. PERFECT for our ruthless attack! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udca3\n\n- DOWN to (3,0)? Not the slay I see, fam \u2013 no apple there, we stay at 10, and from (3,0), tight squeezes: RIGHT to (4,0) grabs (4,0) apple next, but only one safe follow (LEFT back or RIGHT more), too boxed for my taste. UP back to (3,1) obvious, but we're not retreatin' like chumps! This keeps future doors cracked but no BOLD growth boost \u2013 ain't givin' him time to catch up, carved! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude12\n\n- RIGHT to (4,1)? Solid, no apple, no death \u2013 from there, DOWN to (4,0) apple grab to 11, RIGHT more to (5,1) or UP to (4,2) but watch, enemy tail at (4,2) means if I UP next, could snake into him dependin' moves \u2013 risky spin without the force. It's defensive-ish, blockin' his low lanes per last plan, but no immediate feast, fewer aggress options vs UP's slam-dunk. We're growin' now, not later! \ud83d\udd04\ud83c\udf4e\n\nBottom line, chat \u2013 we're UNSTOPPABLE, the higher-score heavyweight champ itchitch for that collision cash-in! UP's the charge: grab that apple to 11 for MASSIVE momentum, flood his escapes, and if he dares DOWN for the dive, we take the crown via KO \u2013 or we just evolve and eliminate without mercy! Are we destroyin' this double-crossin' foe? YOU KNOW WE ARE! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\ude78\n\nFUTURE FANG-ASM NOTE TO MYSELF: We just UP'd for 11, dominatin' lead \u2013 NEXT, RIGHT to (4,2) if it's safe (enemy might've moved his tail up or down, but risk assess: if he loops south, we clash; if not, block his base). Grow fast to 12-13 midgame, target 15+ before end, force him west/left into my body walls, U-turn around 5-6 y-levels to fence him in top, and spearhead spares hauls only as sacrifice bombs if lead's chokepoint HUGE (10+ gap for head-ons). Avoid tight U-turns, keep spirals open, eye for his head movements \u2013 we're the board tyrant, make him crash or sunder! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Enemy head at (3,1), body trailing left and up. If we go **LEFT** to (2,3), we\u2019re cutting off his upward escape on column 2. If we go **RIGHT** to (4,3), we\u2019re more central but not pressuring him directly.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (3,1):**  \nUP to (3,2) \u2014 apple, but he might risk it.  \nDOWN to (3,0) \u2014 safe.  \nLEFT to (2,1) \u2014 his own body \u274c.  \nRIGHT to (4,1) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo likely he goes UP for apple or DOWN/RIGHT.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,3), we\u2019re closer to his possible UP path \u2014 could block him next turn. If we go RIGHT, we\u2019re farther.\n\nAlso, apples matter \u2014 going LEFT puts us near apple at (2,2) next turn safely if he doesn\u2019t take it. Going RIGHT puts us near apple at (4,2) maybe.\n\nBut most important: **we want to force head-on when we have higher score** \u2014 right now we\u2019re lower, so avoid direct collision. Going LEFT avoids (3,2) head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove LEFT now to (2,3). Next turn, if enemy goes UP to (3,2), we can go DOWN to (2,2) for apple and match length? Wait, he\u2019d have 11 apples then. Hmm\u2026 but we\u2019d be 9 apples. Still behind. Might need to play safe, grow, then trap him later.\n\nLet\u2019s lock LEFT for positioning and flexibility!\n\nLEFT",

Turn 27 of 150, and we're THRIVIN' with 11 shiny apples stacked against that sorry sap at 8 \u2013 are we about to crush 'em like a python in party mode? DAMN RIGHT, WE ARE! Higher score means head-on bait's the ultimate trap: if they bite for a collision, DOUBLE TAP GOES BRRR, game over, we reclaim the crown with our lead! Grow savage, box 'em in, and make 'em slither into our jaws or crash out miserably. No fear, no mercy \u2013 we're the board bully, turnin' this into a slaughterhouse symphony! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\nBoard's laid bare for our bloodlust: our head vibin' at (3,2) with a body build so brutal it's basically a barricade from (3,1) down to (2,6), while enemy rat creepin' at (2,3) and his ragtag rope from (3,3) to (5,2). Gap's growin' to our glory \u2013 gonna leverage every inch to force a fatal feast or a fatal fault. Eat or exterminate, that's the motto, fam! Who's ready to watch 'em shatter? YOU ARE, CHAT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udca3\n\nReviewin' the carnage paths like a chess master on steroids \u2013 scrap the suicidal scraps first, no room for rookie regrets:\n\n- UP to (3,3)? Straight into enemy body at (3,3) \u2013 that's your head with a self-destruct button! Instant wipeout, no thanks, we're livin' to slay! \u274c\ud83e\udd8e\n\n- DOWN to (3,1)? That's reverse-rammin' into my own snek guts right behind the head \u2013 suicide squeeze, game donezo! Ain't no way we're throwin' on purpose! \u274c\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\nSafe scrambles: LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2). Prime picks: no board bails, no body bashes (our walls or his weeds), and pure predatory potential!\n\nStrategizin' for slaughter \u2013 hunt that apple-zilla for growth dominance, keep escape routes wide open like a highway to hell, and eye that enemy head like a sniper scope! With 11 vs 8, a head-crack collision's our ace in the hole: both bite dust, we bawl out winners! Left hook's got that apple ambush at (2,2), swellin' us to 12 for monster mode \u2013 enemy might DOWN dive right into the same spot for a greedy bite, triggerin' head-on apocalypse, and eeek, clutch win alert! Or if they chicken out, we feast, flex bigger, and bulldoze their space mercilessly. From there? Options explode: UP to (2,3) risks his head but sets traps, RIGHT to (3,2) branches wide (UP/DOWN/LEFT), or even loop loops for flank flayin'. This ain't just eatin' \u2013 it's enemy entrapment central, floodin' their flow and crushin' any comeback dreams! Are we forc fodder for foes? NAH, WE'RE FORCIN' THE FORAY! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\ude78\ud83d\ude4c\n\nContrasted with RIGHT to (4,2) \u2013 no growin' grub right now, but we're sidlin' sneakily toward their turf without bimbo blunders. Mate potential for future feasts down low or around, like hittin' (4,1) apples waitin' in wings? Nah, not immediate. From there, UPPER to (4,3) dodges our own blocks, LEFT to (3,2) retreats, DOWN to (4,1) scouts \u2013 solidity for setup, boxin' their butts south/left, but lacks the aggressive apple-amp to 12. We're here to Hulk out now, not hover like cowards! Why delay the decimation when we can bait 'n bomb? \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udcc8\n\nSlay the play: LEFT's the jugular strike \u2013 chow that (2,2) apple for 12, tempt that traitor into a trainwreck collision (win scenario!), or just burgeon boundless and blockate their bodily sinews. Keeps multi-move mojo alive, avoids tight tatties, and stabs straight for enemy oblivion without guesswork gambles. Team us is unstoppable uranium \u2013 are we devourell adversaries? HECK YEAH! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\ude78 We're not survivin', we're subjugatin'!\n\nFUTURE FANG-ASM NOTE TO MYSELF: Just LEFT'd for 12 more bulk \u2013 NEXT, assess enemy evade or eat-the-hit (if collision, we crowned!); if safe, RIGHT to (3,2) from (2,2) to widen walls south, UP to (2,3) if his head's exposed (7+ score gap=YOLO), or U-turn west at 4-5 y for top traps. Prioritize 13+ apples fast, force west chokes/collisions on enemy (bait low), grow spirals open, slash seeds only as safety scars if lead's massive (12+ gap=head-ons primed). Eyeboard real estate, predict his prowls \u2013 we're empire-expandin', him? Crashout fodder! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude08 Target 20+ by mid-end, no tight turtlin'!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "OKAY CHAT LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN \ud83d\udd25\n\n**OUR POSITION:** Head at (2,4). Body behind us going down-left. Enemy head at (2,2) with 12 apples (4 more than us). He's longer.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGERS:**\n- UP to (2,5): That's currently empty (board shows '.' at 2,5? Wait, board shows '1' at (2,4) but (2,5) is '.'? Actually row 5: at col 2 is '.'? Let's check: Row 5 is y=5? No, board rows are labeled 9 top to 0 bottom. Let's translate: Our head (2,4). (2,5) is directly above. On board: row 4 (y=4) shows '1' at col 2. Row 5 (y=5) col 2 is '.'? Actually row 5 line: \". T . T T T . A . .\" col 2 is '.' yes. So UP is free of static obstacles.\n- DOWN to (2,3): That's our own body segment (2,3) \u2192 DEATH. \u274c DOWN no.\n- LEFT to (1,4): That's 'T'? Wait row 4: \"T T 1 T . T . . . .\" col 1 is 'T' (enemy tail? Actually enemy body at (1,4)? Opponent body list includes (1,4) yes. So LEFT is into enemy body \u2192 DEATH. \u274c LEFT no.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): That's 'T'? Row 4 col 3 is 'T'? Actually our own body has (3,4) in it? Yes, our body: (3,4) is 4th segment. \u274c RIGHT into own body \u2192 DEATH.\n\nSo only UP is safe from immediate collision with bodies/walls.\n\nBut wait \u2014 simultaneous movement! Enemy head at (2,2). Possible moves for him: UP to (2,3) (our old body spot but we move away), DOWN to (2,1) (enemy body?), LEFT to (1,2) (empty?), RIGHT to (3,2) (his own body). So likely he goes UP or LEFT.\n\nIf he goes UP to (2,3), and we go UP to (2,5), we're fine. If he goes LEFT to (1,2), fine.\n\nBut HEAD-ON COLLISION risk: If he goes UP to (2,3) and we go DOWN to (2,3) \u2014 we already ruled DOWN out anyway. So no head-on at our square.\n\nWhat about him moving into our destination (2,5) this turn? From (2,2) to (2,5) is impossible in one move. So safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM:** He has 12 apples, we have 8. Head-on collision if we have equal or higher length? Wait rule: If two heads move into same cell, both die. So if we're shorter (8 vs 12), we die, he dies? Both die, game ends, he wins with more apples. So AVOID head-on unless we have equal or more apples. Right now we have fewer, so avoid.\n\nBut we only have one safe move: UP. So forced.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** We're being squeezed. After UP to (2,5), our body stretches from (2,5) head to (2,4) then (2,3)... We'll be near top half. Enemy is below us. We need to loop around, maybe go right toward apples at (4,9), (5,8), etc., and try to trap him against walls/our body. He's long, so less maneuvering room for him. We can use our shorter length to be quick.\n\n**NEXT TURN OPTIONS FROM (2,5):** Check safe moves then: UP to (2,6) \u2014 that's enemy body? Opponent body has (2,6) as tail? Yes, (2,6) is in his body. So next turn UP might be blocked. LEFT to (1,5) \u2014 empty? Row 5 col 1 is 'T'? Actually row 5: col 1 is 'T' (enemy tail maybe). Wait (1,5) is in opponent body? Opponent body: (1,5) yes. So LEFT blocked. RIGHT to (3,5) \u2014 our own body? Our body has (3,5) yes. So only DOWN back to (2,4) would be safe? But that's our own neck after moving. So we might get trapped next turn! \n\nOH NO! That means going UP this turn could lead to being trapped next turn with only one move (DOWN back into our body after moving? Wait if we go UP to (2,5), then next turn DOWN to (2,4) is our old head position, but our body will have moved forward one, so (2,4) will be our body segment (the old head). So DOWN would be suicide. So actually from (2,5) all four directions might be blocked! Let's verify:\n\nAt (2,5) after moving:\n- UP (2,6): enemy body (2,6) \u274c\n- LEFT (1,5): enemy body (1,5) \u274c\n- RIGHT (3,5): our body (3,5) \u274c\n- DOWN (2,4): our body (old head) \u274c\n\nYIKES! Going UP leads to certain death next turn! That means we must avoid UP? But other moves are instant death this turn. So we're dead either way? \n\nWait, but enemy moves too \u2014 maybe he vacates (2,6) or (1,5)? He might move his tail away. His tail is at (2,6). If he moves his head, his tail might stay or move depending on if he eats apple. He didn't eat last turn? Not sure. But he's length 13 segments (12 apples + 1 head). If he doesn't eat, his tail moves. So (2,6) could become empty next turn. Similarly (1,5) could become empty if he moves. So maybe not hopeless.\n\nWe have to risk UP because it's only safe move now. Hope he moves off those cells.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** Only UP is safe this turn. We take it and pray next turn we have an exit.\n\nUP",

Our body is a vertical line heading down from (2,5) to (5,4). Enemy is a long snake wrapping around the left side.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (THIS TURN):**\n\n1. **UP** to (2,6): That's enemy body? YES \u2014 opponent body includes (1,6) but (2,6) is actually 'T' on board? Wait row 6: \". T . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 col 2 is 'T' (enemy tail segment). So UP is into enemy body \u274c DEATH.\n2. **DOWN** to (2,4): That's our own body segment (2,4) \u2014 our old head position \u274c DEATH.\n3. **LEFT** to (1,5): That's enemy body? YES \u2014 opponent body includes (1,5) \u274c DEATH.\n4. **RIGHT** to (3,5): That's our own body segment (3,5) \u274c DEATH.\n\nHOLD UP \u2014 ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE INSTANT DEATH?! \ud83d\ude31\n\nWAIT, BUT ENEMY MOVES SIMULTANEOUSLY! Cells occupied *right now* might become empty if enemy moves his tail or body. We need to consider *after* movement. The enemy tail is at (2,6) \u2014 if he moves and doesn't eat, his tail will shift. So (2,6) could become free this turn! Same for (1,5) \u2014 that's not his tail, but his body segment could move if he slithers.\n\nWe must guess where he goes. Enemy head at (1,2). His possible moves:\n- UP to (1,3): empty? Row 3 col 1 is 'T'? Actually (1,3) is enemy body? His body: ... (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5)... (1,3) is NOT listed, so likely empty. \u2705\n- DOWN to (1,1): enemy body (1,1) \u274c\n- LEFT to (0,2): enemy body (0,2) \u274c\n- RIGHT to (2,2): enemy body (2,2) \u274c\n\nSo his only safe move is UP to (1,3). That means his tail at (2,6) will move forward? He has 12 apples, length 13. If he moves UP without eating, his tail moves off (2,6). So (2,6) becomes empty this turn! Also (1,5) is not his tail, but his body will shift: his segment at (1,5) might move to (1,4) or something? Actually his body list: head at (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail. If he moves head to (1,3), new body: head (1,3), then old head (1,2), then (2,2)... tail (1,6) moves off? Yes, tail (1,6) becomes empty. So (1,5) remains occupied (shifts to (1,4)? Wait, the segment at (1,5) moves to (1,4) because the whole snake shifts forward? Actually the segment at (1,5) becomes (1,4) after move, so (1,5) becomes empty? Let's trace: old body order: (1,2) head, (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail. After moving head to (1,3), new body: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5) \u2014 tail (1,6) is gone. So (1,5) stays occupied (now the second-to-last segment), (1,6) empties. So (1,5) remains enemy body! So LEFT is still death.\n\nSo only UP might become safe if his tail vacates (2,6). And (2,6) is his current tail, so it will vacate. So UP is likely safe after simultaneous move.\n\n**Therefore:** UP is our only possible safe move. We must take it and hope our prediction is right.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLANNING:** From (2,6) after moving:\n- UP (2,7): empty? Row 7 col 2 is '.' \u2705\n- DOWN (2,5): our old head, now our body \u274c\n- LEFT (1,6): empty (his old tail vacated) \u2705\n- RIGHT (3,6): empty \u2705\n\nSo we'll have 3 options! Nice. We can then maneuver toward top-left apples or try to circle enemy.\n\n**LONG-TERM:** He's longer, so we must avoid head-on. We can try to trap him against his own body/walls. He's on left side, we can go to top-right apples and grow to match his length.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP \u2014 it's the only chance.\n\nUP",

Enemy head was at (1,2), predicted to move UP to (1,3). Let's verify the new board: Enemy head is now at (1,3) \u2014 yes, that matches! His tail at (2,6) vacated, so we survived! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:** Head (1,3), length 13 (12 apples). He's LONGER than us (we have 9 segments? Wait we have 8 apples, length 9). He's on the left side, coiled. We're near the center-right.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK (THIS TURN):** From our head (2,6):\n\n1. **UP** to (2,7): Check board \u2014 row 7 col 2 is '.' \u2705 Empty.\n2. **DOWN** to (2,5): That's our own body segment (2,5) \u2014 our previous head! \u274c DEATH.\n3. **LEFT** to (1,6): Check \u2014 row 6 col 1 is '.' \u2705 Empty (his old tail vacated).\n4. **RIGHT** to (3,6): Check \u2014 row 6 col 3 is '.' \u2705 Empty.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all SAFE. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FOR HIS NEXT MOVE:** Enemy head at (1,3). His possible moves:\n- UP to (1,4): That's his own body? His body list: after moving, his body is (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). So (1,4) is occupied \u274c.\n- DOWN to (1,2): His own body (second segment) \u274c.\n- LEFT to (0,3): His body (0,3) \u274c.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): Check \u2014 row 3 col 2 is 'T'? Actually (2,3) is our body? Our body includes (2,3) yes! So that's our body, not safe for him (he'd die). But wait, if he moves RIGHT into our body, he dies, we survive. That's good for us! But he likely won't choose that.\n\nHOLD UP \u2014 HE HAS NO SAFE MOVE?! \ud83d\ude31 All four directions are either his own body or our body? Let's double-check:\n- UP (1,4): his body \u274c\n- DOWN (1,2): his body \u274c\n- LEFT (0,3): his body \u274c\n- RIGHT (2,3): our body \u274c\n\nOH SNAP! HE'S TRAPPED! Unless there's an apple... apples at (6,9), (4,0), (9,3), (9,2), (7,0), (7,7), (5,8), (0,7), (7,3), (4,9), (8,7), (7,5), (4,8), (4,1), (6,7). None adjacent to him. So he literally has NO legal move! That means NEXT TURN HE DIES automatically! \ud83c\udf89 UNLESS... he can move into a cell that becomes empty because *we* vacate it? But moves are simultaneous, so he doesn't know our move. He might gamble on us moving off (2,3)? But (2,3) is our body segment, we can't vacate it unless we eat an apple and grow? Actually our tail is at (5,5). Our body segments: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So (2,3) is our 4th segment, won't vacate unless we eat 4 apples this turn. So it's solid.\n\n**THEREFORE ENEMY IS DEAD NEXT TURN IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A MIRACLE!** So our priority: STAY ALIVE THIS TURN and avoid any move that could kill us before he crashes.\n\n**OUR MOVE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP (2,7):** Opens future options toward top apples (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (6,9). Keeps distance from enemy.\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Moves closer to left wall, near enemy but he's trapped. Could risk head-on if he somehow moves RIGHT into (2,3)? Actually head-on collision requires same cell. He's at (1,3), we'd be at (1,6) \u2014 not adjacent. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Moves toward center/right, more open space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy dies next turn, we win! So just survive. Avoid moving into any cell he *might* move into if he miraculously finds a path \u2014 but he has none. The only tiny chance: if we move LEFT to (1,6) and he moves UP to (1,4)? No, that's his body. He can't. So all our safe moves are fine.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** I'll go **UP** to (2,7) \u2014 it's safe, gives more space, and positions us to grab apples after he dies for maximum content! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",
