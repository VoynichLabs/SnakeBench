From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall.

UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close.

However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk.

Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall.

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close.

Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat.

The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes.

The enemy snake ID 1 is at (5,6) with an empty body, so no immediate threat from its head.\n\nFrom my current position (5,2), the Manhattan distances to the apples are:\n- (7,5): |7-5| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (9,4): |9-5| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (8,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (6,5): |6-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- (4,9): |4-5| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a distance of 3. All adjacent cells (north, south, east, west) are empty, and moving right to (6,2) reduces the distance to (8,2) to 2 while keeping the path clear of obstacles. Moving left, down, or up increases the distance to (8,2) or keeps it the same, which is not optimal. The apple at (6,5) is also present but farther away, so it's not the priority.\n\nNo immediate threats: the enemy snake is at (5,6), but with no body, and moving right changes the x-coordinate, reducing the chance of interaction. The board shows no other snakes or blocked paths ahead toward (8,2).\n\nGoal: Minimize time to reach the closest apple by reducing x-coordinate until (8,2) is reached. If the apple is consumed, continue to the next closest.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving right to build on the current path, but analyze apple distances after each move to adjust direction if necessary. Be aware of enemy positions, but this doesn't seem critical yet.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",

Since I'm at (6,2) and the apple is at the same row but higher column, I need to increase my x-coordinate to reach it. Moving left or down or up would increase the distance or be unnecessary since the row doesn't change.\n\nThe adjacent cell to the right is (7,2). From there, the distance to (8,2) is only 1, and it's empty (based on board state). After moving right to (8,2), I'd consume the apple and grow, gaining points.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,7) with an empty body, so no immediate threat or obstacles on the path to (8,2). Since I'm continuing from a previous RIGHT move, this aligns with the strategy of progressing horizontally.\n\nThe goal is to gain points by consuming apples, so targeting the closest one is key. After consuming (8,2), I'll reassess the nearest apple.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to get closer to the apple.\n\n--End of thinking out loud--\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nI'll move towards the closest apple and then, upon reaching it, evaluate the next closest one, considering any new threats or obstacles.\n\n### Decided Next Move: RIGHT",

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat.

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

The cell (7, 2) is adjacent and moving there (east) is a step towards (8, 2). If (7, 2) is occupied, I may die, but based on the distance and no other obvious threats, moving right is the best initial action.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move right to (7, 2). Then, assess if the apple at (8, 2) is now reachable and make the next move accordingly. If the right direction is blocked, consider alternative paths to other close apples like (6, 5) or stay cautious for enemies.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nTarget the closest apple at (8, 2) by moving east. Move towards it in 1-2 steps if safe, then evaluate the next closest apple upon getting closer or after eating one.\n\n### Decided Next Move: RIGHT",

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat. Also, keep an eye on the board for apples and avoid walls or enemies.\n\nNow, for the move, I'll go with UP.\n\n{## Response Format ##}\n\n**My decided next move: UP**",

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat. Also, keep an eye on the board for apples and avoid walls or enemies.\n\nNow, for the move, I'll go with UP.\n\n{## Response Format ##}\n\n**My decided next move: UP**",

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

The apple at (6,5) is also present but farther away, so it's not the priority.\n\nNo immediate threats: the enemy snake is at (5,6), but with no body, and moving right changes the x-coordinate, reducing the chance of interaction. The board shows no other snakes or blocked paths ahead toward (8,2).\n\nGoal: Minimize time to reach the closest apple by reducing x-coordinate until (8,2) is reached. If the apple is consumed, continue to the next closest.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving right to build on the current path, but analyze apple distances after each move to adjust direction if necessary. Be aware of enemy positions, but this doesn't seem critical yet.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT",

The apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). From my current position, the Manhattan distances are:\n\n- (7,5): |7-6| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- (9,4): |9-6| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- (8,2): |8-6| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (6,5): |6-6| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- (4,9): |4-6| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a distance of 2. Since I'm at (6,2) and the apple is at the same row but higher column, I need to increase my x-coordinate to reach it. Moving left or down or up would increase the distance or be unnecessary since the row doesn't change.\n\nThe adjacent cell to the right is (7,2). From there, the distance to (8,2) is only 1, and it's empty (based on board state). After moving right to (8,2), I'd consume the apple and grow, gaining points.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,7) with an empty body, so no immediate threat or obstacles on the path to (8,2). Since I'm continuing from a previous RIGHT move, this aligns with the strategy of progressing horizontally.\n\nThe goal is to gain points by consuming apples, so targeting the closest one is key. After consuming (8,2), I'll reassess the nearest apple.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to get closer to the apple.\n\n--End of thinking out loud--\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nI'll move towards the closest apple and then, upon reaching it, evaluate the next closest one, considering any new threats or obstacles.\n\n### Decided Next Move: RIGHT",

I think my best strategy is to aim for the apple at (8, 2) or the apple at (7, 5). Moving left to (6, 7) is probably my best bet. It puts me in a better position to reach both apples, and it's not a terrible risk. I can always reassess my options and make a better move if I have to.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with...

Then, assess if the apple at (8, 2) is now reachable and make the next move accordingly.

The only safe adjacent moves are down to (8, 1) or up to (8, 3), both of which are empty and not occupied by walls or myself or enemies.\n\nAvailable apples: (7, 5), (6, 5), and (1, 6) are the valid apples (since (9, 4) and (4, 9) are on walls and cannot be accessed). The closest apple is (7, 5) with a Manhattan distance of 4. From my current position, I cannot reach any apples in one move, so I should move towards the general direction to potentially get closer to an apple.\n\nMoving up to (8, 3) is the better choice because: \n- It places me one step closer to the apple at (7, 5) (Manhattan distance decreases to 3 from (8, 3)).\n- Moving down to (8, 1) is farther from the apples and leads towards the bottom wall, which is less beneficial.\n- There are no immediate threats from the enemy snake (at (3, 7)), so I don't need to avoid specific paths.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving up, if I eat an apple, I'll focus on growing longer. If not, I should continue moving towards (7, 5) by prioritizing left or up/down moves based on the shortest path to that apple, avoiding walls and collisions.\n\nThere is one apple at (7, 5) with Manhattan distance 3 from (8, 3). I can reach it by moving left to (7, 3) or up to (8, 4) or directly left if possible, but currently from (8, 2) only vertical moves are safe.\n\n### Decided Next Move: UP",

The Manhattan distance to (9, 4) is 1, which is minimal, and this increases our score while gaining length, which is advantageous in a multi-apple game.\n- DOWN to (9, 2): This is invalid because (9, 2) is on the board, but it doesn't contain an apple right now, and the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2. Allowing that distance to increase isn't ideal unless there's an immediate threat.\n- LEFT to (8, 3): This is a valid move, but the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2 (|8-9| + |3-4| = 2). Moving away from the apple could lead to needing more moves to reach it, increasing the chance of encountering obstacles or being blocked.\n\nAdditionally, there are no immediate threats from enemies or walls. Snake #1 is at (5, 8), which isn't close to our current position, and no other snakes are mentioned. The path to (9, 4) is clear and direct.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize points and we have a short path to an apple, the priority should be to consume (9, 4) as soon as possible. Moving UP achieves this in one step, unlike other directions that require multiple moves or even increase distance.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After consuming (9, 4), we should reassess the apple distribution. The remaining apples include (7, 5) and (6, 5), which are closer together compared to (4, 9) or (1, 6). We should aim to target these while avoiding enemy movements.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP",

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat.

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

Moving down to (6, 8) also doesn't seem like a good option.\n\nI'm considering a strategy of trying to move towards the apple at (7, 5).

            "rationale": "Okay, let's assess the current situation based on the last move information. From the description, we are now at position (9, 3), with the head at that location. The board shows apples at (7, 5), (9, 4), (6, 5), (4, 9), and (1, 6), so the closest apple is still (9, 4), at a Manhattan distance of only 1 from our current head. Moving to (9, 4) directly would consume the apple and score a point.\n\nNow, considering the available moves:\n- UP to (9, 4): This position contains an apple, so moving there will eat it and likely cause us to grow. The Manhattan distance to (9, 4) is 1, which is minimal, and this increases our score while gaining length, which is advantageous in a multi-apple game.\n- DOWN to (9, 2): This is invalid because (9, 2) is on the board, but it doesn't contain an apple right now, and the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2. Allowing that distance to increase isn't ideal unless there's an immediate threat.\n- LEFT to (8, 3): This is a valid move, but the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2 (|8-9| + |3-4| = 2). Moving away from the apple could lead to needing more moves to reach it, increasing the chance of encountering obstacles or being blocked.\n\nAdditionally, there are no immediate threats from enemies or walls. Snake #1 is at (5, 8), which isn't close to our current position, and no other snakes are mentioned. The path to (9, 4) is clear and direct.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize points and we have a short path to an apple, the priority should be to consume (9, 4) as soon as possible. Moving UP achieves this in one step, unlike other directions that require multiple moves or even increase distance.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After consuming (9, 4), we should reassess the apple distribution. The remaining apples include (7, 5) and (6, 5), which are closer together compared to (4, 9) or (1, 6). We should aim to target these while avoiding enemy movements.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP",

This move is advantageous as it maximizes points and minimizes risk since there are no immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-encounters.\n\nThe alternative move, left to (8, 3), is valid but does not consume an apple and increases the Manhattan distance to the nearest remaining apples (e.g., (6, 5) and (7, 5)), potentially wasting turns. Given the high-value apples closer to the center of the board, moving right to (10, 3) is invalid due to the out-of-bounds board, and down to (9, 2) is invalid because it would collide with the body segment.\n\nAfter consuming the apple at (9, 4), the next priority should be to target the clustered apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) since they are closer together, allowing for efficient growth. The snakes should then plot a path to these apples while monitoring the enemy snake at (5, 9), which could be a threat if it moves towards the region.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: After gaining the point from the apple, move to a position that allows access to the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) by increasing y-coordinate toward row 5.

            "rationale": "### Thinking Out Loud\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (4, 0) with only the head, so the body is empty, meaning no self-collision risk yet. The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat. Also, keep an eye on the board for apples and avoid walls or enemies.\n\nNow, for the move, I'll go with UP.\n\n{## Response Format ##}\n\n**My decided next move: UP**",

The other directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the apples, (8,2) is the closest at Manhattan distance 5, but it's not in a direction I can directly move to without changing orientation. Moving UP increases y towards other potential apples like (4,9) and might keep me in the same column as the enemy snake at (4,7), but since both are just heads with no body, there's no immediate threat. Moving LEFT or RIGHT could help avoid the column threat or get me closer to some apples, but I need to prioritize safety first.\n\nFor my first move, I should avoid invalid moves and choose a direction that doesn't immediately put me in danger. UP to (4,2) is valid and keeps me in the same column, which might be beneficial if I can navigate away later. It also avoids the left or right walls initially.

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

            "rationale": "Okay, let's assess the current situation based on the last move information. From the description, we are now at position (9, 3), with the head at that location. The board shows apples at (7, 5), (9, 4), (6, 5), (4, 9), and (1, 6), so the closest apple is still (9, 4), at a Manhattan distance of only 1 from our current head. Moving to (9, 4) directly would consume the apple and score a point.\n\nNow, considering the available moves:\n- UP to (9, 4): This position contains an apple, so moving there will eat it and likely cause us to grow. The Manhattan distance to (9, 4) is 1, which is minimal, and this increases our score while gaining length, which is advantageous in a multi-apple game.\n- DOWN to (9, 2): This is invalid because (9, 2) is on the board, but it doesn't contain an apple right now, and the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2. Allowing that distance to increase isn't ideal unless there's an immediate threat.\n- LEFT to (8, 3): This is a valid move, but the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2 (|8-9| + |3-4| = 2). Moving away from the apple could lead to needing more moves to reach it, increasing the chance of encountering obstacles or being blocked.\n\nAdditionally, there are no immediate threats from enemies or walls. Snake #1 is at (5, 8), which isn't close to our current position, and no other snakes are mentioned. The path to (9, 4) is clear and direct.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize points and we have a short path to an apple, the priority should be to consume (9, 4) as soon as possible. Moving UP achieves this in one step, unlike other directions that require multiple moves or even increase distance.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After consuming (9, 4), we should reassess the apple distribution. The remaining apples include (7, 5) and (6, 5), which are closer together compared to (4, 9) or (1, 6). We should aim to target these while avoiding enemy movements.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP",

This move is advantageous as it maximizes points and minimizes risk since there are no immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-encounters.\n\nThe alternative move, left to (8, 3), is valid but does not consume an apple and increases the Manhattan distance to the nearest remaining apples (e.g., (6, 5) and (7, 5)), potentially wasting turns. Given the high-value apples closer to the center of the board, moving right to (10, 3) is invalid due to the out-of-bounds board, and down to (9, 2) is invalid because it would collide with the body segment.\n\nAfter consuming the apple at (9, 4), the next priority should be to target the clustered apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) since they are closer together, allowing for efficient growth. The snakes should then plot a path to these apples while monitoring the enemy snake at (5, 9), which could be a threat if it moves towards the region.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: After gaining the point from the apple, move to a position that allows access to the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) by increasing y-coordinate toward row 5.

The board is 10x10, with walls at x=0 (left), x=9 (right), y=0 (bottom), and y=9 (top). Currently, moving down (decreasing y to y=-1) or left (decreasing x to x=-1) is invalid and would kill me instantly because I hit the wall. Moving down is especially bad since I'm at the bottom row (y=0). Down direction would lead to an out-of-bounds error, triggering a death.\n\nAvailable directions: UP or RIGHT (LEFT is available but might not be ideal due to proximity to the left wall at x=0; moving to x=3 is safe but slightly risky). UP increases y towards the middle and upper parts of the board. I have apples nearby, like (8,2) at Manhattan distance 6, which is relatively close. The enemy snake is at (4,8), directly above me on the same column, so staying on x=4 might put me in line with it, but since we both have no body, it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). (4,9) is on the same column, but it's very high up (y=9), while (8,2) is lower (y=2) and to the right. Since I'm at the bottom, moving up might be a good way to access more apples without wasting time changing columns. However, I should avoid continuous movement on the same x=4 column if it puts me at risk from the enemy.\n\nFor the first move, since I have no prior movement data, I'll choose UP because it allows me to start exploring the board upwards, potentially towards the apple at (4,9) or other apples above. Moving RIGHT might be better to get away from the enemy's vertical line, allowing me to break free and find an apple from a different path. But UP is simple and direct for initial movement.\n\nStrategy for next turns: I will prioritize moving towards the closest apple (e.g., (8,2)) or a less contested one to minimize risk. I need to watch out for the enemy snake's position and adjust accordingly, perhaps by changing columns if it's a threat. Also, keep an eye on the board for apples and avoid walls or enemies.\n\nNow, for the move, I'll go with UP.\n\n{## Response Format ##}\n\n**My decided next move: UP**",

My snake ID 0 is currently at position (4, 2) with no body segments, so there's no immediate self-collision risk. The board is 10\u00d710, with (0,0) being the bottom-left and (9,9) the top-right, using standard coordinates. The available directions from (4,2) are UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). All of these positions are currently empty, and the enemy snake at (4,6) is just a head with no body, so there are no conflicts right now.\n\nI need to consider the apples: (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), (4,9). From the current position (4,2), the Manhattan distances are:\n- To (8,2): |8-4| + |2-2| = 4\n- To (6,5): |6-4| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- To (7,5): |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- To (9,4): |9-4| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- To (4,9): |9-2| + |4-4| = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a Manhattan distance of 4. To minimize time to food, I should reduce the x-distance (since (8,2) has the same y-coordinate). Moving RIGHT increases x, decreasing the distance from 4 to 3 (e.g., to (5,2)). Moving LEFT would increase distance or not help. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't reduce the distance to (8,2) effectively since y doesn't factor into its target.\n\nThere might be multiple apples, but (8,2) is attainable directly with a sequence of right moves. Considering the column where the enemy is located (x=4), staying or moving away could be advantageous, but since the enemy has no body, it's unlikely to be an immediate threat. Moving right also exits this column, potentially reducing future collision risks.\n\nFor the initial move, I should prioritize reducing distance to the closest apple while avoiding unnecessary risks. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) aligns with this strategy and keeps me moving closer to (8,2). Even though the last move was UP, I need to adapt to the current state.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Continue moving towards apples by focusing on reducing distances, and avoid enemy columns or other snakes if their presence changes. Stay aware of the board for any new snake movements or apple locations.\n\nNow, decided next move: RIGHT.",

The board is 10x10, with standard coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. Apples are at (7,5), (9,4), (8,2), (6,5), and (4,9). The enemy snake ID 1 is at (5,6) with an empty body, so no immediate threat from its head.\n\nFrom my current position (5,2), the Manhattan distances to the apples are:\n- (7,5): |7-5| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (9,4): |9-5| + |4-2| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- (8,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n- (6,5): |6-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- (4,9): |4-5| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThe closest apple is at (8,2) with a distance of 3. All adjacent cells (north, south, east, west) are empty, and moving right to (6,2) reduces the distance to (8,2) to 2 while keeping the path clear of obstacles.

The board shows no other snakes or blocked paths ahead toward (8,2).\n\nGoal: Minimize time to reach the closest apple by reducing x-coordinate until (8,2) is reached. If the apple is consumed, continue to the next closest.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving right to build on the current path, but analyze apple distances after each move to adjust direction if necessary.

We were last at (5, 8), and we moved right, so now we're at (5, 8) again. We want to make a decision on what to do next.\n\nWe see that there are apples at (7, 5), (9, 4), (6, 5), (4, 9), and (1, 6).

Moving left to (5, 7) is not an option since we can't decrease our x-coordinate.\n\nMoving up to (4, 8) puts us in a good position to reach the apple at (5, 5), but there's not one directly above us. Moving down to (6, 8) also doesn't seem like a good option.\n\nI'm considering a strategy of trying to move towards the apple at (7, 5). If I move up to (6, 8) and then left to (6, 7), I'll be in a good position to move right towards the apple.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move up first and then try to make my way towards the apple from there.\n\nMy decided next move: UP",

            "rationale": "Okay, let's assess the current situation based on the last move information. From the description, we are now at position (9, 3), with the head at that location. The board shows apples at (7, 5), (9, 4), (6, 5), (4, 9), and (1, 6), so the closest apple is still (9, 4), at a Manhattan distance of only 1 from our current head. Moving to (9, 4) directly would consume the apple and score a point.\n\nNow, considering the available moves:\n- UP to (9, 4): This position contains an apple, so moving there will eat it and likely cause us to grow. The Manhattan distance to (9, 4) is 1, which is minimal, and this increases our score while gaining length, which is advantageous in a multi-apple game.\n- DOWN to (9, 2): This is invalid because (9, 2) is on the board, but it doesn't contain an apple right now, and the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2. Allowing that distance to increase isn't ideal unless there's an immediate threat.\n- LEFT to (8, 3): This is a valid move, but the Manhattan distance to (9, 4) becomes 2 (|8-9| + |3-4| = 2). Moving away from the apple could lead to needing more moves to reach it, increasing the chance of encountering obstacles or being blocked.\n\nAdditionally, there are no immediate threats from enemies or walls. Snake #1 is at (5, 8), which isn't close to our current position, and no other snakes are mentioned. The path to (9, 4) is clear and direct.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize points and we have a short path to an apple, the priority should be to consume (9, 4) as soon as possible. Moving UP achieves this in one step, unlike other directions that require multiple moves or even increase distance.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After consuming (9, 4), we should reassess the apple distribution. The remaining apples include (7, 5) and (6, 5), which are closer together compared to (4, 9) or (1, 6). We should aim to target these while avoiding enemy movements.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP",

This move is advantageous as it maximizes points and minimizes risk since there are no immediate threats from walls, other snakes, or self-encounters.\n\nThe alternative move, left to (8, 3), is valid but does not consume an apple and increases the Manhattan distance to the nearest remaining apples (e.g., (6, 5) and (7, 5)), potentially wasting turns. Given the high-value apples closer to the center of the board, moving right to (10, 3) is invalid due to the out-of-bounds board, and down to (9, 2) is invalid because it would collide with the body segment.\n\nAfter consuming the apple at (9, 4), the next priority should be to target the clustered apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) since they are closer together, allowing for efficient growth. The snakes should then plot a path to these apples while monitoring the enemy snake at (5, 9), which could be a threat if it moves towards the region.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nStrategy for next turn: After gaining the point from the apple, move to a position that allows access to the apples at (6, 5) and (7, 5) by increasing y-coordinate toward row 5.

The goal is to secure points efficiently. I should avoid positions where I might be cornered or eaten by enemies. Moving left and up has higher value apples, so it's more beneficial than focusing on the low-value (4,1) apple.\n\nI should move LEFT to (8,2) and then, in future turns, move up to reach the apples at (6,5) and (7,5), which are directly reachable once I clear the row. From (8,4), I could directly access (9,4) if needed. After gaining points, I must monitor the enemy snake's position.\n\nFor this move, I decide to move LEFT.\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**",
