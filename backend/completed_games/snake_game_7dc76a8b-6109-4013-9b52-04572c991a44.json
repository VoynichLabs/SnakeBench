That's a reasonable plan to reach the apple.\n\nBut before committing, I should consider the move directly to (7, 2). Moving left now avoids any immediate danger and puts me on a path toward the apple.\n\nIs moving left safe?\n- No obstacles or walls at (7, 2).\n- No enemy snake here.\n- I am currently at (8, 2), moving left would be safe.\n\nNext, I should plan to keep moving towards the apple at (1, 2), but for now, the best immediate move is heading left to get closer.\n\n**Decision:** I will move LEFT to continue approaching the apple at (1, 2).\n\nNext move: LEFT.",
