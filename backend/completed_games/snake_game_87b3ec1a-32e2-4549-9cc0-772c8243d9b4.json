Down is safe and directly gains a point while keeping multiple future directions open (from (1,5) we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT with less risk of trapping).  \n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating (1,5), consider moving toward the apple at (0,2) on the left side, as the path appears clear and enemy snakes are not nearby.
