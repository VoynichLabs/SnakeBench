Next turn, possible moves from (6,7): UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7) \u2014 but (7,7) will be my tail, so it\u2019s safe next turn. So 3 directions safe next turn (since tail will be behind). Good.  \n- Other moves without apple: still safe but slower growth.  \n\n**5. Long-term:**  \nEarly game \u2014 getting first apple quickly is good, provided it doesn\u2019t trap me. (6,7) seems safe: far from enemy, and board is open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (6,7), avoid moving into possible enemy path; likely move away from center if enemy approaches.  \n\n**Final choice:** LEFT (towards apple at (6,7)).  \n\nLEFT",

Next turn from (0, 4): UP (0, 5) possibly enemy? Enemy could be at (0, 5) or (1, 6). But enemy could also go RIGHT to (1, 6).

So after eating apple at (0, 4), next turn only DOWN safe? Wait \u2014 check: body after eating: [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] \u2014 so (1,4) is now body, so RIGHT is deadly. UP possibly enemy head collision risk next turn if enemy goes DOWN to (0,5).

DOWN keeps options open and moves toward (1,0) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of enemy cutting off escape:**  \nEnemy at (0,6) could go RIGHT to (1,6), then next turn enemy could go DOWN to (1,5) or LEFT to (0,5) etc. Not an immediate threat to my DOWN or RIGHT paths.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGetting the apple at (0,4) now is tempting but could reduce future mobility next turn because body blocks RIGHT and UP may be enemy head. DOWN to (1,3) keeps more options, avoids immediate trap, and allows heading to (1,0) apple soon.  \n\nGiven the priority of staying alive and keeping future options, DOWN is safer than LEFT here despite missing the apple.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, head-on collision is simultaneous move into same cell \u2014 so if I go LEFT to (0,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (0,4), no collision this turn. But next turn if I go UP to (0,4) and enemy stays there? No, enemy would have moved away from (0,4) next turn.

All four directions lead to death. This is a critical situation.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the rules. If another snake's head moves into any part of my body, that snake dies and my body remains. However, if I move my head into another snake's body, I die.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's head at (2, 1), they have several options:\n- UP to (2, 2): Safe, empty cell\n- DOWN to (2, 0): Their own body segment \u2717\n- LEFT to (1, 1): Their own body segment \u2717  \n- RIGHT to (3, 1): Safe, empty cell\n\nThe enemy will likely move UP or RIGHT, which means they won't be moving into (1, 0).\n\nHowever, the problem remains: I have no safe moves from (0, 0). Unless... the enemy might move UP to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (3, 1), vacating (2, 1). But that doesn't help me at (0, 0).\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board state. Looking at the ASCII board, I can see that my snake occupies (0, 0) as head, with body at (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3). The enemy snake #1 has head at (2, 1) with body segments at (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n\nFrom (0, 0):\n- UP: (0, 1) - my body \u2717\n- DOWN: (0, -1) - out of bounds \u2717\n- LEFT: (-1, 0) - out of bounds \u2717\n- RIGHT: (1, 0) - enemy body at (1, 0) \u2717\n\nI truly have no safe moves. This means I will die regardless of what move I choose. However, I must make a move. Since all moves lead to death, I'll choose the move that might potentially cause the enemy to die if they collide with me.\n\nBut wait - if I move RIGHT to (1, 0) and the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 1), their head would be at (1, 1) and mine at (1, 0). No collision.\n\nActually, the only slim hope is if the enemy makes a mistake and moves into my path, but given the board state, this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me check if there's any possibility I'm missing... The enemy's tail might be moving... Let me trace their likely movement:\n\nEnemy snake #1 at (2, 1) will likely move:\n- UP to (2, 2) - this seems safest, toward open space\n- RIGHT to (3, 1) - also safe, toward open space\n\nThey won't move DOWN to (2, 0) or LEFT to (1, 1) because those are their body segments.\n\nGiven that I have no safe moves, and I must choose one, I'll choose RIGHT. At least this might create some pressure on the board, though it's essentially suicide.\n\nActually wait - let me reconsider the rules one more time. Could I potentially survive if the enemy moves in a specific way?\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (2, 2), then (2, 1) becomes empty (their former head position). But I'm at (0, 0), so that doesn't help.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 1), same situation.\n\nThere's no scenario where I can survive from (0, 0). I was trapped by my previous move. The only theoretical possibility would be if the enemy's tail at (1, 2) moves away, but that's not how snake movement works - only the head moves, and the body follows.\n\nI'm dead either way. I'll choose RIGHT as it's no worse than any other option.\n\nRIGHT",
