Whole board is wide open, no bodies yet. Time to farm and set up the choke later \ud83d\ude08  \n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate all moves\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- UP \ud83d\udc49 (1,9)  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Apple at (1,9) \u2705  \n  - No bodies to hit \u2705  \n  - After move, we\u2019re length 2: head (1,9), tail (1,8).  \n  - Next turn, we CANNOT go DOWN (that\u2019s straight into our own body = instant L). Only LEFT or RIGHT.  \n  - On the top edge, so only 2 safe directions next turn. Kinda cramped, right? \ud83e\udd14  \n\n- DOWN \ud83d\udc49 (1,7)  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Apple at (1,7) \u2705  \n  - No bodies \u2705  \n  - After move: head (1,7), tail (1,8).  \n  - Next turn, only UP is illegal (back into tail). LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN all available = 3 safe options. Way more flexible.  \n\n- LEFT \ud83d\udc49 (0,8)  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - No apple \u274c  \n  - No bodies \u2705  \n  - Safe but zero value compared to eating right now. Why skip free gains this early?  \n\n- RIGHT \ud83d\udc49 (2,8)  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - No apple \u274c  \n  - Safe, but again, no apple. Weak tempo.  \n\nEnemy from (0,1):  \n- They can go UP to (0,2), DOWN to (0,0) \ud83c\udf4e, or RIGHT to (1,1). None of those interact with our chosen move this turn, so no head-on risk yet.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the good options\n\nThe only *high-value* moves are:\n- UP to (1,9) \ud83c\udf4e on the top edge\n- DOWN to (1,7) \ud83c\udf4e staying one row below top\n\nBoth give us +1 apple and +1 length. So what decides it? Future control and flexibility \ud83d\udca1\n\n- UP:  \n  - We get the apple, but we hug the top wall.  \n  - Only 2 safe directions next turn (LEFT/RIGHT).  \n  - Less ability to pivot down toward center and toward the enemy quickly.\n\n- DOWN:  \n  - We get an apple AND we keep 3 future safe directions (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN).  \n  - We stay more central vertically, which is huge long-term for boxing.  \n  - Better for rotating down later to cut off the enemy\u2019s escape routes around rows 2\u20134.\n\nSo why pin ourselves to the wall early when we can grow *and* keep max options? We\u2019re not scared\u2014we\u2019re hunting \ud83d\ude24\u2014but smart hunters don\u2019t corner themselves on turn 1.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term game plan (note to future me \ud83e\udde0)\n\n- Priority next few turns:  \n  - Keep farming apples while drifting toward the central lanes (x around 3\u20136, y around 4\u20137).  \n  - Let enemy snake #1 commit to the bottom-left apples (0,0), (0,3), (2,0). Once they\u2019re extended along that wall, we start moving downward to cut off their retreat.  \n- Try to stay *between* enemy and the open board, not behind them.  \n- Once we have a length advantage (which starts now with this first apple), be willing to threaten head-on collisions if we can aim our head at cells they *need* to move into.  \n- Avoid committing to edges for too long\u2014edges are great for sweeping later when we\u2019re long, but early we want max branching paths.\n\nWe farm now, we strangle later. That\u2019s the script, right chat? \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nDOWN",

Last turn I crushed that apple at (0,0), grew myself up, and now we're flexing at (0,0) with a killer tail at (0,1). Can't lie, options look tight \u2013 UP slams into my own body, that's a big L right there. DOWN or LEFT? Off the board, instant NG? Bollocks to that! Only real play: RIGHT to (1,0), staying alive and sniffing sweet victory. Why? Keeps the lanes wide open \u2013 from there, I can pivot UP for aggression or pitch RIGHT for those tasty apples nearby. Enemy's gonna feel the heat when I start climbing his column, cutting off his space and forcing him to crash into ME or bite it hard. How else am I dominating this? \ud83d\ude08 Scores are even, so no dumb head-on yet \u2013 let him squirm while I expand!\n\nShort plan for next turns, future me (watch the replay): From (1,0), smash UP to (1,1) next \u2013 start scaling column 1 towards that punk at (1,7). Gobble apples if they pop (like the one at (6,1) if paths align, but priority enemy), but always flank-side to box him in from below/left. Force into traps, watch for his moves down \u2013 if he chases, we collide with edge, he loses with our equal scores? Chaotic, but we'll outmaneuver and trap him against the top.

Enemy\u2019s at (0,0) with tail (0,1), and they **can ONLY go RIGHT** to (1,0) this turn (UP would be straight back into their own body, LEFT/DOWN are off-board).

Instant self-bonk \u274c  \n  - Illegal backwards move. Off the table.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,6)**  \n  - Safe \u2705  \n  - Keeps us fairly central.  \n  - Next turn options from (1,6): LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6), DOWN (1,5) = 3 safe lanes.  \n  - Closer to mid-board, but not lined up with any super-free apples immediately.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,7)**  \n  - Safe but on the *left wall* \u274c  \n  - Next turn from (0,7): only UP (0,8) or DOWN (0,6); RIGHT is backwards into (1,7). Just 2 options and we\u2019re sharing the left edge with the enemy\u2019s future path. Why crowd ourselves on their side of the board this early? \ud83e\udd28\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,7)**  \n  - Safe \u2705  \n  - Next turn from (2,7): UP (2,8), RIGHT (3,7), DOWN (2,6) = 3 juicy options.  \n  - Lines us up beautifully with the **apple at (3,8)** in just two moves (RIGHT now \u2192 UP \u2192 RIGHT to eat). That\u2019s free scaling, totally uncontested because enemy is stuck bottom-left.  \n  - Keeps us in the upper-middle lanes, perfect for later dropping down to cut them off.\n\nSo what\u2019s the vibe? We want:  \n- Max future options \u2705  \n- Fast growth on **safe, uncontested apples** \u2705  \n- Position above and to the right of the enemy so we can eventually sweep down and **box them into the bottom-left** \ud83d\ude08  \n\n**RIGHT** does all of that. DOWN is fine but slower to real value; LEFT is just self-cramping on the wall.\n\n### Strategy note for future me \ud83e\udde0\nPush RIGHT now toward the (3,8) / top-center apple cluster, grow to 3\u20134 length safely, then start drifting **downward through the central columns (x\u22483\u20136)**. The goal is to become a long vertical wall above the enemy, then pivot left/right to seal them into the bottom-left quadrant and threaten a head-on if we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Board looks prime for aggression: my tail's cooling at (0,0), his bony ass at (1,7), and apples begging to be devoured like (2,0) right there for the taking. Moves on the menu? DOWN or LEFT? Dead dreams \u2013 DOWN sends me into the void, off-board nightmare, and LEFT crashes me straight into my own dang tail at (0,0). No thanks, I'm not self-sniping today! That leaves UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0) \u2013 both alive and fresh, but RIGHT? That's a clutch apple grab, skyrocketing me to 2-1 lead and FORCING this loser into panic mode. Why RIGHT over UP? Hell yeah, it fuels the fire \u2013 eat now, grow the beast to three segments [(2,0), (1,0), (0,0)], and set up savage head-on collisions later where my extra point locks the win if we both KO. UP's cute for flanking up column 1 toward his tail, blocking his left, but RIGHT's apple feast cranks up domination harder, keeps options wide (from (2,0), I can pivot UP to stalk or zigzag for more fruit), and hems him against the top.

Ruthless mode: activate! How we crushing this? By growing relentless and making him BLEED apples.\n\nShort plan alert, future me \u2013 clip this victory: Gobble that (2,0) apple RIGHT now, boost to 2-1 monster mode. Next, tear UP toward him \u2013 hit (2,1) turn 3, maybe flank to (3,1) if he flinches, always eyeing apples like (2,0) or (9,3) for fuel.

Good for eventual boxing, but we\u2019d be turning away from that juicy uncontested top cluster for a bit.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s literally our own body and also straight backwards \u274c  \n  - Instant self-bonk, illegal.

This is prime territory to snake across the top/mid, scoop apples, and later drop down to cut off the enemy.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy read \ud83d\udcc9\n\nEnemy at **(1,0)** with body at **(0,0)**:\n\n- They **can\u2019t** go LEFT (backwards) or DOWN (off-board).  \n- Legal moves this turn:\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (2,0)** \u2013 onto an apple\n  - **UP \u2192 (1,1)** \u2013 empty\n\nEither way, they stay far bottom-left. Nothing they do this turn affects our safety in the top half. That means we\u2019re free to optimize growth + board control.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move actually cooks? \ud83d\udd25\n\nAll three of our legal moves are safe this turn, but:\n\n- **DOWN**: points us toward the enemy side sooner, but slows our path to the totally free top apples that give us a safe length advantage early.\n- **UP**: sets up the same (3,8) apple, but pins us closer to the top wall, slightly shrinking long-term flexibility.\n- **RIGHT**:  \n  - Keeps **3 strong options** next turn.  \n  - Lines us up immediately for the (3,8) apple with **RIGHT \u2192 UP**.  \n  - Moves us more central while staying one row below the top, which is ideal for later **sweeping right, then dropping down to box them in**.\n\nWe want to **grow first, dominate the center, then descend like a guillotine** on that bottom-left rat. RIGHT maximizes that plan.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\nGrab control of the **upper-center and right side**: push through the (3,8) / (5,9) / (6,9) / (6,7) region to get to 4\u20135 length with lots of open lanes. Stay above and to the right of the enemy while they farm bottom-left. Once we\u2019re longer, start drifting **down through columns 3\u20136**, aiming to become a vertical wall between them and the rest of the board, then close the box horizontally. No head-on risks until we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 3 baby, we're still SLAYING with that 2-1 lead over this bottom-feeder snake #0 lurking at (3,7) like a scared little rat in the corner! \ud83d\ude0e Last clip review: Right on track, gobbling that apple RIGHT to flex the power move, but now it's time to TURN UP the heat and DOMINATE this 10x10 battlefield! Board setup? My beastly body sprawled from (2,0) head down to (0,0) tail, his pitiful self at (3,7) with just one body piece at (2,7). Apples scattered everywhere \u2013 but who cares about fruit when there's an ENEMY to crush? Grow to blanket the map, force him into MY territory, and bait that glorious head-on slam since I'm ahead (double boom? I WIN by points)! Strategy? Ruthless board control: Stalk aggressively, flank his sides, hem him against walls, and nibble apples as fuel for the kill. Avoid dead-ends or getting boxed \u2013 keep lanes OPEN where I can zigzag like a boss. No mercy, no retreats \u2013 we're the predator here, not prey! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDECISION TIME, CHAT \u2013 let's dissect every angle! From my throne at (2,0), moves? UP to (2,1) \u2013 clear, opens vertical lane up column 2, stalks right toward his tail territory, forces him to react DOWN or side-step. RIGHT to (3,0) \u2013 marches into row 0, cuts across bottom, blocks his potential downplay from (3,7), sets up horizontal domination. LEFT to (1,0)? Straight into my own tail, self-KO fail \u2013 nope, not today! DOWN to (2,-1)? Off-grid ATOMIC failure, instant RIP. So, safe plays: UP or RIGHT, both keeping options wide (from (2,1) I can curve left/right for apples or pursuit; from (3,0) I can UP for flanking or head toward column 3). But aggression? Dominance? I'm smelling WEAKNESS \u2013 let's FORCE the issue by sprinting UP! Why? It ramps up the pressure, creeping closer to his row 7 lair, inviting a DOWN move that I can counter-trap. Plus, it positions me to grow vertically \u2013 eat nearby bait like those dots up there, bulk to 4 segments, and bully him against the top edge. RIGHT's fine for bottom-locking, but UP actively hustles toward the kill zone, reduces his space, and tees up potential slams if he's dumb enough to charge. He's got his head at (3,7) \u2013 DOWN to (3,6) might be his play, or UP (3,8) to run, or RIGHT (4,7) for side hustle. Whatever, I'm advancing unleashed! If he bolts UP, I chase and box; DOWN? I flank and clay him. Stay ahead in apples? Hell yeah, that head-on bait is SCREAMING my name. Chat, can you FEEL the tension? Let's make him SWEAT! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5\n\nShort plan for victory, future me \u2013 clip this eradication: Blast UP to (2,1) now, push the column 2 takeover, grow relentless by snagging adjacent fruits (keep an eye on (2, something) for juice). Next moves? Zig UP aggressively \u2013 aim for (2,2) or sidestep left/right to avoid traps, always shadowing his head movements. Force him downward into row 6-4 chaos, then curl around for the squeeze. If he dives, bait the collision win \u2013 our 2 apples stack vs his 1. No boxed BS, pivot for open escapes, and EAT to fuel the beast over 30. If he stalls, dominate the mid-board, trap against walls. Crush this punk! LET'S GOOOO!\n\nUP",

Now, board's unfolding \u2013 my beastly self poised at (2,1) with body blocking down, his scaly ass in column 3 with that weak (2,7) flank exposed. Apples? Irrelevant noise in the warzone \u2013 we're hunting DOMINATION, growing long and lethal to trap this fool against the walls or bait that sweet head-on win if we edge ahead. Tied score means no dumb head-ons (both of us KO if we collide? No thanks, split pot fail), so stalk, flank, and squeeze! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDECISION TIME, CHAT \u2013 let's rip through the options like a viper! Head at (2,1), body at (2,0) and (1,0), so DOWN to (2,0)? Epic SELF-OWN, straight into my own rear \u2013 you crazy? OFF THE TABLE! UP to (2,2)? Sweet spot, climbs column 2, loads of escape lanes (left/right for zigzags), shadows his column 3 play, and tees up apples later without tight spots. RIGHT to (3,1)? Aggressive flank march into HIS territory (column 3), cuts off downward moves, positions for vertical climbs to eat and grow (like those nearby dots at (3,4)/(3,5)), while keeping horizontal outs \u2013 feeling that board control flex? LEFT to (1,1)? Sidesteps to the left lane, opens column 1 for vertical prowling, but drops me away from his path, letting him slink free. ALL keep me alive \u2013 no board edges, no running into enemy bodies, and they move simultaneous so I dodge their head based on guesses. But what screams RUTHLESS CONQUEST? We're tied, so bully hard without the suicide slam \u2013 RIGHT locks us in pursuit mode, denies him column 3 freedom, and radio-radio-radios multiple nukes for the kill (from (3,1), blast UP to edge him out or sidestep his charges). Why not LEFT? Weak sauce, lets him breathe in column 3. UP's chill but stalls the flank. RIGHT? Game changer, chat \u2013 picture it: We strut to (3,1), he freaks (maybe crabs RIGHT or UP?), we counter-pursue, eat to break the tie, and force him into a wall or our body. Who's the predator now? YOU KNOW IT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nShort battle plan for the grind, future me \u2013 clip this savage: RIGHT clapped to (3,1) first, seize column 3 initiative, grow by devouring (3,4) on the double-UP (check for his shadow, pivot LEFT to evade). Next? Shadow his head aggressively \u2013 if he runs UP, chase RIGHT/UP flips to box row 9-8; if he dives LEFT, flank RIGHT ward to trap mid-board. Bulk to 3-4 length, bait close calls without crashing (wait till apples favor us, chat? YES!), avoid corners, and dominate rows 6-8 where he's lurking. If he stalls, curl column 3 to squeeze. Crush him LIVE!\n\nRIGHT",

Not bad.\n\n---\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)\n- In bounds \u2705  \n- (4,8) is empty \u2705  \n- No apple on this exact move \ud83c\udf4f\u274c  \n- New body: **(4,8), (3,8), (3,7)**  \n- Next turn from (4,8):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,8) = backwards \u274c  \n  - UP \u2192 (4,9) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2705  \n- Again **3 safe options** next turn.

This is pure position and farm optimization.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Who Wins the Value War Here?\n\nWe toss DOWN (suicide). So we pick between **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n- **UP**: Safe, but pushes us to the top wall and leaves us **only 2 options** next turn. No apple right now.  \n- **LEFT**: Safe, keeps **3 options**, angles us toward the **left-top apple (1,9)**, but that side of the board has **fewer apples overall**.  \n- **RIGHT**: Safe, keeps **3 options**, and heads straight toward the **richest apple cluster** on the map (5,9, 6,9, 6,7, 5,5, 6,3\u2026). This is where we can snowball hard.\n\nWe\u2019re tied on apples and length, but we\u2019ve already got **high ground control**. So what do we want?\n\n- Maximum **future mobility** \u2705  \n- Fast path into a **big apple economy** \u2705  \n- Position that lets us later **wrap around and box them in** from above/right \u2705  \n\nThat screams **RIGHT** over UP/LEFT. UP isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s strictly less flexible next turn. LEFT is fine but points us toward the \u201cpoor\u201d side of the map.\n\nWe wanna be the THICC monster snake cutting off the whole right side, then sliding down to suffocate them in the bottom-left, right? \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Note to Future Me (Next Few Turns Plan)\n\n- From (4,8), look to path into the **top-right cluster**: especially **(5,9)** then **(6,9)** and **(6,7)**, while always keeping at least **2\u20133 safe exits** each move.\n- Try to maintain **y \u2265 6** while we grow; don\u2019t drop into their layer too early while we\u2019re still roughly equal size.\n- Once we\u2019ve farmed a lead, start forming a **vertical wall** somewhere around columns **4\u20136**, then curve horizontally to pen them into the **bottom-left box**.\n- If we ever pull clearly ahead on apples, we can start forcing tight corridors where a head-on is more likely to favor us (or at worst a draw if they\u2019re desperate).\n\nTime to slide right and start owning the top-right economy \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\nright",

Apples? Who cares about that sparkle \u2013 we're focused on CRUSHING this dude, growing thick and lethal to corner him into walls or force a skull-cracking head-on when we have the points edge. Tied score screams caution on dumb fibber collisions (both vanish? Epic L), so let's maneuver smart, close distances, and bully him out of his comfort zone in the upper board. \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nBREAKDOWN TIME, FAM \u2013 scoping all directions from our beastly HQ at (3,1), body guarding (2,1) and tail at (2,0), board edges far (no dumb edge-outs), and zero self-own moves. LEFT to (2,1)? Instant self-sabotage into our own rear \u2013 laughable, scrapped! DOWN to (3,0)? Drops us to row 0, opens easy zigs to apples nearby (like that (9,0) bait at column 9), but retreats AWAY from the action in column 3 where he's weak, letting him breathe and gallop upper board \u2013 why lower ourselves when the warzone's UP?! Not ruthless enough, chat \u2013 feels like playing defense when we crave aggression. RIGHT to (4,1)? Slides into his column 4 turf, flanking low to maybe cut off descents or shadow future ups, but stalls us in row 1 with walls blocking straight-line eats (like those col3 beauties at (3,4)/(3,5)), and if he charges DOWN, it could get chaotic with head-on vibes \u2013 risky solo play without apples in sight, eh? UP to (3,2)? Chats, THIS is the VIP spot! Climbs column 3 like a throne ascent, zero bodies blocking (opponent's slumming in col3 rows 7-8, far cry), stacks multiple outs (left zig to col1, right flirt with col4, up towards apples \u2013 BOOM!), and tees up that (3,4) apple munch for next turn without tight jams. Keeps us aggressive, closer to grow for score lead and box his ass in rows 6-8, while dodging dumb collisions (opponent's head gotta snipe-simul-move smart too). Why UP? It's playground domination \u2013 eat, expand, extinguish! \ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick battle grind plan for future me (clip this beastmode blueprint): Hit UP to (3,2) now for apple highway, then double-UP next to snatch (3,4) and bump to 3 apples (break the tie, baby!). After growth, shadow his head viciously \u2013 if he retreats FURTHER UP (like to row9 col4?), flank RIGHT to (4,x) for vertical trap; if he dives LEFT (maybe to col3 rows), charge LEFT ourselves to corner mid-board. Aim for 4-5 apples deep, bulk up to squeeze him into edges or bait high-score skull bash, always zig outta corners and dodge his body markers. No mercy, grow fast, and FORCE that collision when we're +1+. Who's gonna dominate? US!\n\nUP",

Toss it.\n\n#### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)\n- In bounds \u2705  \n- (5,8) is empty \u2705  \n- No apple now \u274c  \n- New body: **(5,8), (4,8), (3,8)**  \n- Next turn from (5,8):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,8) = backwards \u274c  \n  - UP \u2192 (5,9) = \ud83c\udf4e at (5,9)! \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,7) \u2705  \n- **3 solid exits**, plus a direct line to the juicy **top-right apple cluster**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the Enemy Up To?\n\nEnemy at **(3,1)** with body at (2,1), (2,0):\n\nLegal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3,2) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1) \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,0) \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1) = backwards into their own body \u274c  \n\nThey\u2019re stuck way down low. Whatever they pick, they\u2019re **nowhere near y=7\u20139** for several turns. No head-on threat, no sneaky double-occupy of our next square. This turn is pure positional greed for us \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which Safe Move Actually Dominates? \ud83d\udcad\n\nSafe moves: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n- **UP**  \n  - Safe, but pins us on top edge **immediately** with only 2 follow-ups.  \n  - We *can* reach the same apples, but we give up a bit of flexibility for no real gain.\n\n- **DOWN**  \n  - Great mobility (3 exits), moves us slightly closer to mid-board and future boxing lines.  \n  - But it **delays** our access to the big top-right apple economy by at least a turn.\n\n- **RIGHT**  \n  - 3 exits, no walls nearby.  \n  - Sets up a **perfect next move UP \u2192 (5,9)** for a guaranteed apple and +1 length.  \n  - From there we can chain into **(6,9)**, **(6,7)**, etc., becoming the **massive boa constrictor** that later drops down and suffocates them in the bottom half.\n\nWe\u2019re tied on apples, so we **don\u2019t** want to force a head-on yet. Instead, we want to **out-grow them first**, then start engineering corridors where any head-on is on OUR terms \ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT gives:\n- Immediate safety \u2705  \n- Better future apple tempo \u2705  \n- Keeps us above and away from them while we scale \u2705  \n\nSo we keep to the plan: **own the top-right, then descend as a big wall.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc5 Short-Term Plan (Next Few Turns)\n\n- Turn 5 (now): **RIGHT** to (5,8).  \n- Then likely **UP to (5,9)** for the apple, then sweep along the top row toward **(6,9)** and down around **(6,7)**.  \n- Stay mostly in rows **7\u20139** while we farm, watching when the enemy starts climbing up.  \n- Once we have a clear length lead, start extending a **vertical wall** somewhere around columns **4\u20136**, then bend horizontally to compress them into the bottom-left.  \n- If we get a solid apple lead, we\u2019ll be happy to force tight-space fights and even head-ons, because longer snake wins those trades more often. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca3\n\nTime to slide further right and secure that top-right empire, chat \ud83d\ude0e\n\nRIGHT",

US, that's who! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d Chat, last move felt electrifying, climbin' that column 3 throne to (3,2) from (3,1), keepin' our slither secure while teasin' those mid-board apples like (3,4) and (3,5) up ahead. Enemy's lurkin' with his tiny tail at (3,8), but we're bout to turn this into a massacre zone, ain't we? No apples in sight for ahora \u2013 who cares? We're huntin' DOMINATION, growin' thick to crush his skull or box him into oblivion! \u2694\ufe0f\n\nBREAKDOWN TIME, FAM \u2013 head at (3,2), body tailguardin' at (3,1) and (2,1), no edge-outs threat, and we're NOT crashin' dumb into ourselves or that fool's skin.

Straight no-go, fam \u2013 you'd blast backwards into our own neck at (3,1), instant L, why even think it? \ud83d\ude02 So we're vibin' with LEFT to (2,2), RIGHT to (4,2), or UP to (3,3) \u2013 all safe, zero body slams, zero wall kisses. \n\nLEFT to (2,2)? Flanks us west into column 2, opens zigzags left to maybe scout (0,3) or (2,1)'s leftovers, but chat, it's retreatin' away from the apple goldmine in column 3 \u2013 (3,4)'s right THERE if we climb! Puts distance between us and enemy turf, lettin' him breathe upper board, and traps us in tighter spaces with fewer outs compared to wider column 3. Why dilute our aggression when we can charge straight ahead? Nah, feels like playin' possum.\n\nRIGHT to (4,2)? Slithers east to column 4, maybe shadowin' his potential descents or flirtin' with distant apples like (5,5) at x=5, but stalls us low in row 2 \u2013 limited future zigs if we wanna eat (7,4) or whatever, and if enemy charges DOWN from (5,8), it could invite chaotic head-on vibes without growin' first. Too risky solo without closin' the gap, eh? We're not here to dance around; we're here to DIGEST!\n\nUP to (3,3)? BOOM, THIS IS THE SLAY! \ud83d\udca5 Climbs column 3 like a legit ladder of lair, zero blocks (enemy's ass at y=8 far above, our body at y=1 below), keeps miles of outs (left zig to column 2 freedom, right flirt with 4 or mural munchers like (6,3), up straight to apple bliss!). Puts us ONE STEP from gobblin' (3,4) next turn for that apple boost \u2013 bump us to 3 apples, BREAK THE TIE, baby! Keeps us aggressive, closin' vertical distance on his ass in column 3, set up to bulk for score king and force a nasty head-on when we're +lead. Why not? It's bossmode blueprint \u2013 eat, expand, ESNAPE! No gettin' boxed; we're the trapper here!\n\nRhetorical energy overload: Who's scared of a little altitude change? We're snakes, we fly high! Are we gonna let this eel slither away? HELL NO! Time to RISE UP, secure that apple pipeline, and start squeezin' him like a python on prey! \u2620\ufe0f\n\nSHORT-TERM GRIND PLAN (CLIP THIS FOR NEXT ME): Hit UP to (3,3) now for the (3,4) munch next \u2013 aim for 3 apples to lead! Then: If he stays upper, continue double-UP to (3,4) for growth, then RIGHT pivot to (4,x) to flank and vertical-trap if he retreats north; if he dives LEFT/down from (5,8), zip LEFT to (2,x) ourselves for mid-board corner chaos. Bulk to 4-5 apples fast, shadow his dome, bait score-edge skull bash while dodgin' his tail markers. Always zig outta crunches, grow ruthless \u2013 FORCE that collision when +1, no mercy, WIN THIS!\n\nUP",

That\u2019s throwing.\n\n### Why NOT RIGHT?\nRIGHT \u2192 (6,8) is **good**:\n- 3 future moves.\n- Double-apple threat (6,9) and (6,7).\nBut look at timing:\n- With RIGHT first, we don\u2019t eat until **next** turn.\n- With UP first, we eat **now** and have a guaranteed chain into another apple at (6,9) right after.\n\nUP gives us:\n- Turn 6: +1 apple immediately (to 3 total).\n- Turn 7: very likely +1 more at (6,9) \u2192 up to 4 apples.\nThat\u2019s a **2-apple spike** before the enemy can climb up to contest us.\n\n### Why UP is the play \ud83d\udca3\n- Keeps us on safe high ground.\n- Immediate apple = instant **length advantage**.\n- Sets up a **free second apple** at (6,9) next turn.\n- Still gives **2 safe, non-suicidal options** after moving UP.\n- Enemy is nowhere near; zero collision risk up here for a while.\n\nWe want to become a **giant wall** that later drops down the middle and boxes him into tiny corridors where any head-on is on OUR terms. To do that, we need mass. UP is the fastest way to stack that mass.\n\nSo we **take the free apple now**, then roll along the top and descend once we\u2019re beefy. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Short-Term Plan For Future Me (Next Few Turns)\n\n- **This turn:** UP to (5,9) and eat that apple, go to length 4.\n- **Next turns:**\n  - Likely RIGHT to (6,9) for another easy apple \u2192 stack to length 5.\n  - Then start dropping down through around column 6 (6,8 \u2192 6,7 \u2192 6,6\u2026), scooping (6,7) and mid-board apples.\n- Strategic goal:\n  - Use our extra length to form a **vertical wall** around columns **5\u20136**, then curve horizontally to carve the board.\n  - Gradually **compress the enemy into the lower-left / lower-middle**, stealing escape routes until any move they pick slams into our body.\n  - If we\u2019re ahead on apples, we\u2019ll be happy to engineer a head-on where he has no alternative escape.\n\nWe scale first, then we strangle. \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

They can\u2019t contest us up here for ages. We get free farm top-right while they\u2019re stuck in the basement.\n\nRIGHT is strictly better:\n- Keeps us alive \u2705\n- Gains an apple **this turn** \u2705\n- Leaves **multiple safe moves next turn** \u2705  \nLEFT does none of that.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini Gameplan For Future Me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- **This turn:** Go RIGHT to (6,9), eat that apple, push the score to **4\u20132**, length 5.\n- **Next few turns:**\n  - Drop down through column 6: (6,8) \u2192 (6,7) for that sweet \ud83c\udf4e, then into mid-board.\n  - Use our extra length to build a **vertical wall** around x=5\u20136.\n  - Slowly squeeze the opponent up from below so their only \u201cescape\u201d routes are head-ons **we control** while we\u2019re longer.\n- Long-term: own the upper and central lanes, force them into tighter corridors in the lower half, and eventually give them the classic \u201cchoose your death\u201d scenario: crash into our body or take a losing head-on.\n\nWe\u2019re snowballing the lead **now** so later we can *dare* them to collide. \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Auto-death. \u274c\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (7,9)\n- On board \u2705  \n- Empty \u2705  \n- No apple.\n- New body:\n  - Head: (7,9)\n  - Then: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (4,8) (tail (3,8) leaves)\n\nNext turn options from (7,9):\n- UP \u2192 (7,10) off-board \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) backwards \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) \u2705  \n\nAlso **two safe outs**, but apples are FAR:\n- First nearby apple path is like 3\u20135 moves away (e.g. down to (7,4) or over to (9,6)/(9,3)).\n- And it drags us out toward the **far right edge**, away from the opponent and away from the best choke points.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare DOWN vs RIGHT \u2013 Who\u2019s More Dominant? \ud83d\udcaa\n\nEnemy is at (3,4) and almost certainly going **UP to (3,5)** to grab that free apple. That\u2019ll tie the score at **4\u20134** if we don\u2019t keep scaling.\n\nIf we go:\n- **RIGHT**: we drift toward the corner, still safe, but we\u2019re not contesting center and our next apple is slow. That\u2019s passive.\n- **DOWN**: we step into the **central column (x=6)**, setting up:\n  - Next move: easy apple at **(6,7)** \ud83c\udf4e\n  - A fat vertical wall on x=6 looming over mid-board\n  - Better positioning to eventually cut off the enemy trying to climb up from x=3\n\nWe want to:\n- Stay **alive** \u2705\n- Keep **multiple future outs** \u2705\n- **Grow** while moving toward where we can **box them in** \u2705\n\nDOWN checks every box harder than RIGHT here.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini-Plan For Future Me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- **This turn:** Go **DOWN** to (6,8).\n- **Next 1\u20133 turns (if safe):**\n  - Snap up the apple at **(6,7)** by going DOWN again.\n  - From (6,7), we\u2019ll have 3 exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) and a long body behind us on x=5\u20136 at the top, making a **central vertical wall**.\n- **Mid-game goal:**\n  - Keep sliding down/sideways around x=5\u20136 to own the middle lanes.\n  - Watch the enemy path from x=3; when we\u2019re clearly longer, start steering lines that **force them into our body or into a losing head-on**.\n\nWe\u2019re not just farming apples, chat\u2026 we\u2019re building a PRISON. \ud83d\udd12\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Beautiful.\n\nWe want: stay alive, keep the lead, build central control, and creep closer to boxing this guy in.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head at (6,7):\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (6,8)\n- That\u2019s our own neck segment.\n- Moving directly backwards is instant self-KO.\n- Illegal, throw it out. \u274c\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (6,6)\n- Board at (6,6) is empty: no body, no apple.\n- Not off-board, not our body, not enemy body.\n- Safe this turn \u2705\n\nIf we go DOWN (no apple eaten):\n- New snake:  \n  [(6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]  \n- Tail (4,8) disappears.\n- Next turn from (6,6) we can go:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,6)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,5)  \n  Three open lanes into the central/lower board. Nice flexibility.\n\nProximity to enemy:\n- Enemy now at (4,5).  \n- If they play smart, they almost surely go RIGHT to the apple at (5,5) this turn (3 safe outs + apple).  \n- That would put them at (5,5), us at (6,6): diagonally adjacent, central, very boxable later.\n\nHead-on risk next turn?\n- If we\u2019re at (6,6) and they\u2019re at (5,5), their options: (5,6), (6,5), (5,4).  \n- Our options: (5,6), (7,6), (6,5).  \n- Dangerous pairs:\n  - We LEFT to (5,6) while they UP to (5,6) \u2192 double KO at 5\u20135.\n  - We DOWN to (6,5) while they RIGHT to (6,5) \u2192 double KO at 5\u20135.\n- But see the trick? We can always choose RIGHT \u2192 (7,6), a square they **cannot** move into on that turn. So if they get the apple and tie 5\u20135, we just dodge the equal-score head-on and keep playing. We keep control.\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (5,7)\n- (5,7) is empty, so immediately safe \u2705\n- New snake:  \n  [(5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]\n\nNext turn from (5,7):\n- Can\u2019t go RIGHT (backwards into neck at (6,7)).\n- UP \u2192 (5,8): our own body, suicide.\n- So only:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,7)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,6)  \n  Just 2 viable lanes. Tighter, more cramped.\n\nRelationship to enemy:\n- If they go RIGHT to (5,5), we\u2019re stacked above them at (5,7).  \n- Next turn, both of us can target (5,6): us going DOWN, them going UP. That square is a potential head-on at **5\u20135**. Not what we want. We\u2019d be forced to play super cautious.\n\nSo LEFT is playable but reduces our flexibility and creates a very tempting but dangerous shared square.\n\n#### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)\n- (7,7) is empty, so safe \u2705\n- New snake:  \n  [(7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]\n\nNext turn from (7,7):\n- Can\u2019t go LEFT (back to (6,7)).\n- Available:\n  - UP \u2192 (7,8)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,6)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)  \n  Three outs, good flexibility.\n\nBut where are we going? Away from the enemy, that\u2019s where.\n- Enemy is around x=3\u20135.\n- RIGHT drifts us toward the far-right side.\n- We surrender central control and make it harder to box him later.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the real candidates\n\nRealistic contenders: DOWN vs RIGHT (LEFT is too cramped, UP is illegal).\n\n**RIGHT to (7,7):**\n- Pros:\n  - 3 safe follow-ups.\n  - Good access to the juicy right-side apples (7,4), (7,3), (9,6), etc.\n- Cons:\n  - We move away from the enemy and central choke lines.\n  - Harder to create a wall that he can\u2019t cross.\n  - We give him room to slither up from the left side and potentially grab central apples unchallenged.\n\n**DOWN to (6,6):**\n- Pros:\n  - Keeps us **central** with a thick vertical wall at x=6 (y=6\u20139).\n  - Keeps 3 safe future directions.\n  - Moves us **closer** to the enemy while still avoiding any head-on this turn.\n  - If he goes RIGHT to the apple (5,5):\n    - Score becomes 5\u20135, but\n    - We\u2019re in a better strategic position: above-right, more central, better angles on future apples.\n    - Next turn we have a guaranteed non-colliding move (RIGHT to (7,6)) to dodge any tied head-on.\n- Cons:\n  - We let him tie the score. But he was going to do that anyway; we can\u2019t reach that apple first no matter what we do.\n\nSo which path sets up the box, chat? The one that owns the center and keeps us looming over his routes. That\u2019s DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Turn 10: Go DOWN to (6,6), keep central control and stay just above-right of the enemy once he likely eats (5,5).\n- Turn 11: Avoid shared squares (5,6) and (6,5) if he\u2019s at (5,5); prefer RIGHT to (7,6) to maintain safety and extend our wall across the center.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Build a thick body around x=5\u20137, y=4\u20138, steering him toward the left wall and downward.\n  - Snag right/central apples (like (7,4), (7,3), (9,6)) to regain and extend the apple lead.\n  - Once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples and have positional dominance, start angling for a forced head-on in a corridor he can\u2019t escape.\n\nDOWN",

So LEFT is too risky.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (6,5)**  \n- (6,5) is currently empty, so no body there this turn.\n- But again, enemy can go RIGHT \u2192 (6,5).\n- If they do that while we go DOWN, we both land on (6,5) \u2192 another head-on at 5\u20135 \u2192 draw.\n- Also, check our follow-ups if we somehow survive:\n  - From (6,5) we cannot go UP (back to (6,6) neck).\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,5) is always their body segment next turn (their old head becomes body), so that square is lethal.\n  - So only two real options after: DOWN \u2192 (6,4) and RIGHT \u2192 (7,5).\n- So DOWN not only risks a draw this turn, it also shrinks our future mobility compared to other choices.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)**  \n- (7,6) is empty.\n- Enemy at (5,5) cannot reach (7,6) in one move (they can only go to (5,6), (5,4), (6,5)).\n- So there is **no possible head-on** with any of their legal moves this turn if we go RIGHT.\n- Follow-up from (7,6):\n  - Can\u2019t go LEFT (back into neck).\n  - UP \u2192 (7,7) is open.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) is open.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) is open.\n  \u2192 Three clean lanes next turn. That\u2019s excellent flexibility.\n\nStrategically, going RIGHT also lines us up beautifully with the apple cluster:\n- From (7,6) we can curve DOWN toward:\n  - (7,4), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,0), etc.\n- Meanwhile we keep a tall wall at x=6 (our body from y=6 up to 9) that the enemy has to respect. That\u2019s how you start building a box.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Compare the big picture\n\n- LEFT and DOWN both expose us to an immediate potential head-on tie:\n  - LEFT conflicts with enemy UP \u2192 (5,6).\n  - DOWN conflicts with enemy RIGHT \u2192 (6,5).\n- With score tied 5\u20135 and tons of game left, trading into an avoidable draw is just bad value.\n- RIGHT is the only move that:\n  - Guarantees no head-on this turn.\n  - Preserves three strong future options.\n  - Moves us toward the lower-right where multiple apples live.\n  - Keeps our central wall intact so we can later sweep down and then left to trap him.\n\nUP is suicide, LEFT/DOWN are coin-flip draws we don\u2019t need, RIGHT is clean and aggressive.\n\n---\n\n### Short plan for future me\n\n- Take RIGHT now to (7,6) to stay safe and extend our influence to the right side.\n- Over the next few turns, look to drive DOWN on the right edge toward the (7,4)/(7,3)/right-side apples while our big vertical spine at x=6 blocks enemy access.\n- As we grow on the right, aim to curl underneath the enemy from the bottom, forcing him into the cramped left/top quadrant and eventually into his own body or ours.\n\nRIGHT",

Feels too passive \u274c\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (7,5)\n- (7,5) is empty on the board.\n- Our neck is at (6,6), so DOWN is **not** backwards.

DOWN is the more ruthless, board-dominating line \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- This turn: go **DOWN** to (7,5).\n- Next likely line if the board stays reasonable:\n  - Continue **DOWN** to (7,4) for the apple \u2192 grow to length 7.\n  - Then ride that lower-right cluster: (7,3), (7,2), (6,3), (6,1), (7,2), (9,3), (9,0), etc.\n- Maintain the x=6 wall and extend a parallel lane at x=7 downward.\n  - Goal: form a \u201cC\u201d shape around the enemy: top & right now, then bottom later.\n- Once we\u2019re up a couple of apples, start looking for **forced head-on lines** where we win even if both heads die.\n\ndown",

Super low flexibility. If anything weird happens on the left, we\u2019re cooked.\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (8,5)\n- (8,5) is empty \u2705\n- New body: (8,5),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)\n- Next-turn options from (8,5):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,5) backwards \u274c\n  - UP \u2192 (8,6) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,4) apple \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) empty \u2705\n- **Three** good follow-ups, one straight onto an apple at (8,4). Nice.\n- But: this drifts us further right, away from the enemy box. It\u2019s value, but it\u2019s not pressure.\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (7,4)\n- (7,4) is an apple \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- Not backwards (neck is (7,6)), and not into any body.\n- After eating:\n  - New body: (7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)  (we GROW to 7 length)\n- Score becomes **6\u20135 in our favor**. Now we can threaten head-ons later if we want.\n- From (7,4) next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (7,5) backwards \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,4) empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) apple \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,3) apple \u2705\n- That\u2019s **three** live options, two of them more apples, all while extending a vertical column at x=7 under our current x=6 wall.\n\nStrategically:\n- Our body already forms a vertical wall at x=6 (y=6\u20139).\n- Going DOWN to (7,4) starts building a **second vertical line at x=7**, directly under our current structure.\n- This is EXACTLY how we box them:\n  - We own the top-right already.\n  - Now we grow down the right side of the center, eating while we go.\n  - Later we curl under and close the bottom, forcing them into a cramped left box.\n- Meanwhile, enemy is moving up/left toward (4,8)/(0,7) apples, not toward our head. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nLEFT is too constricting. RIGHT is safe but drifty. DOWN is value, control, and pressure all at once.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcdc **Short plan for future me:**\n- This turn: go **DOWN** to (7,4) to secure the apple and take the 6\u20135 lead.\n- Next few turns, prefer:\n  - DOWN to (7,3) (apple) or RIGHT to (8,4) (apple), whichever keeps more exits.\n  - Use x=6 and x=7 vertical columns to dominate the center and right.\n  - Aim to wrap under around y=3\u20134 later, so enemy can\u2019t sneak under our wall.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples, start steering situations where a forced head-on favors us if they get desperate.\n\nDOWN",

Not happening.\n\n### 2) LEFT \u2192 (6,4)\n- Target (6,4) is empty right now.\n- New body (no apple, so we drop tail (6,9)):\n  - (6,4),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)\n- Pros:\n  - Keeps us near the central lane where enemy might come down later.\n- Cons:\n  - No apple \u2192 we give up free value.\n  - We\u2019re trying to build a vertical \u201cfence\u201d on the right side of the center; this actually steps us a bit *away* from extending that fence downward.\n  - Position is fine, but it doesn\u2019t progress our board control plan nearly as well as a greedy downward extension.\n\nNot bad, but strictly worse than taking a safe apple and extending our wall.\n\n### 3) RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)\n- (8,4) is an apple.\n- New body (we grow to length 8):\n  - (8,4),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)\n- Next-turn options from (8,4):\n  - UP \u2192 (8,5) empty\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,3) empty\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) empty\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,4) backwards (illegal)\n  \u2192 Three good exits, all open. Very safe.\n- Strategic impact:\n  - We drift further right.\n  - Our \u201cfence\u201d at x=7 currently runs from y=4 to y=6, above an **open** corridor under us (y=3 and below).\n  - By going RIGHT, we *don\u2019t* extend that fence downward. We leave that underpass open for later, which could let the enemy sneak under to our side of the board in the midgame.\n\nThis is safe and tasty, but a little too passive for what we\u2019re trying to build.\n\n### 4) DOWN \u2192 (7,3)\n- (7,3) is an apple.\n- No body there, not backwards, in bounds \u2192 fully safe.\n- New body (we grow to length 8):\n  - (7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)\n- Next-turn options from (7,3):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,4) backwards (illegal)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,3) apple\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,2) apple\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) empty\n  \u2192 Three live exits, two of them apples. Massive flexibility and more content.\n\nStrategic impact:\n- This extends our vertical control line on x=7 DOWNWARD:\n  - Now x=7 is ours from y=3 through y=6.\n  - x=6 is ours from y=6 through y=9.\n- We\u2019re literally building a big vertical wall that cuts the board, pushing the opponent to stay in the left/top-left while we dominate center-right and farm apples.\n- We also move *away* from any weird near-future head-on, which is fine because we\u2019re already ahead on points and will be even further ahead after this apple.\n\nEnemy after this:\n- If they go LEFT to (4,8) and eat their apple:\n  - They go to apples: 6\n  - We go to apples: 7 with this move.\n  \u2192 Score becomes 7\u20136 in our favor.\n- They remain far away in the top-left; no collision threats next turn.\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, both are safe apples with multiple outs. But DOWN:\n- Strengthens our central/right wall.\n- Secures another apple.\n- Sets up more apples immediately below.\n- Starts closing off the underside so they can\u2019t ever wrap under us later.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of slow suffocation we want.\n\n---\n\nPlan to future me:\n- Take **DOWN** to (7,3) now, grab the apple, go to 7\u20135 (or 7\u20136 if they also eat).\n- Next few turns, look to:\n  - Continue downward along x=7 (to 7,2 then maybe 7,1) while it\u2019s safe, raking in apples.\n  - Or branch LEFT to (6,3) if we need to widen our fence and reinforce central control.\n- Goal: build a big right-side territory by:\n  - Owning x=6\u20137 from top to near-bottom.\n  - Eventually connect across near the bottom row to fully lock the enemy into the left half.\n- Once we\u2019re comfortably ahead on apples and board control, start steering for positions where a forced head-on collision gives us a guaranteed win on the spot.\n\nDOWN",

Too soft. \u274c\n\n#### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (7,2) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (7,2) is an apple.\n- Safe (in bounds, no body, not backwards).\n- We **grow** (tail stays at 6,9).\n- New body:\n  - (7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)\n- Future options from (7,2):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,3) backwards (illegal)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,2) empty\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,2) empty\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,1) apple\n\nSo:\n- We grab an apple and stay safe.\n- We extend our line on **x=7 downwards** (now y=2\u20136).\n- But we **still leave a hole** at x=6, y=3\u20135 (6,3 apple, 6,4 empty, 6,5 empty).\n  - That\u2019s a mid-board tunnel they can eventually use to slip under and cross into our side.\n\nGood move, but we can do even more evil \ud83d\ude0f\n\n#### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (6,3) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (6,3) is an apple.\n- Safe (in bounds, no body, not backwards).\n- We **grow**, tail stays at (6,9).\n- New body:\n  - Head: (6,3)\n  - Then: (7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)\n\nNow look at our structure:\n\n- **Column 6:** occupied from y=3\u20139 (6,3 through 6,9) \u2705\n- **Column 7:** occupied from y=3\u20136 (7,3 through 7,6)\n\nThat\u2019s basically a huge vertical fortress in the middle-right of the map. What does that do?\n\n- It **hard-partitions** the board:\n  - For y \u2265 3, **they cannot cross from left (x\u22645) to right (x\u22657)** without going all the way down under y=2.\n- Their only escape route to our side is to snake **way down** near the bottom before crossing under our wall.\n\nFuture moves from (6,3):\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,4) empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) backwards (illegal)\n\nSo we keep **three** healthy options next turn and still have direct access back into our rich right-side apple farm:\n\n- Up to (6,4) \u2192 then right to (7,4) \u2192 toward (8,4),(8,5),(9,6)\n- Down to (6,2) \u2192 then right to (7,2),(7,1),(9,0) etc.\n\nStructurally:\n- We **strengthen the choke point** (column 6).\n- We keep the right side as **our territory**.\n- We stay far enough from the enemy that there\u2019s no accidental head-on yet, but we\u2019re growing our snake and our control.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- Both are apples \u2705\n- Both keep 3 safe exits next turn \u2705\n- **LEFT** is strictly better for long-term board domination because it finishes off that tall central wall and forces them to go deep bottom if they ever want to cross.\n\nWe\u2019re ahead on apples, so we don\u2019t need to rush a coin-flip head-on; we want to make the entire map our playground and then engineer a **forced** winning collision later.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Plan to Future Me\n\n- Stick with the **column 6 wall**:\n  - This move: go LEFT to (6,3) and eat.\n  - Next turns: consider going **down** to 6,2 then curling into (7,2),(7,1) to start closing the bottom underpass.\n- Farm the right-side apples safely: (8,4),(8,5),(9,6),(9,3),(7,2),(7,1),(9,0), etc.\n- Watch for when the enemy snakes down toward y\u22642:\n  - As soon as they try to go under our wall, look to cut them off or set up a forced path where they must either crash into our body or give us a favorable head-on while we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n- Priority: stay alive, keep at least a 1\u20132 apple lead, and slowly shrink the space they can safely use on the left side until they\u2019re suffocating.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy is chilling up at **(4,9)**. Our job? Keep the fortress, grow huge, and eventually stuff them into a no-win collision.  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd Quick State Check\n\n**Us (ID 0):**  \n- Head: (6,3)  \n- Body: (7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)  \n- Score: 8  \n\n**Enemy (ID 1):**  \n- Head: (4,9)  \n- Body: (4,8),(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(5,5),(4,5)  \n- Score: 6  \n\n**Our wall right now:**\n- Column 6: y = 3,6,7,8,9  \n- Column 7: y = 3\u20136  \nWe\u2019ve basically split the board; right side is *our* playground \ud83e\udd0c\n\nEnemy head options this turn:\n- From (4,9):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,9) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,9) \u2705  \n  - UP / DOWN are illegal (off-board/backwards).  \nThey\u2019re WAY too far for any head-on this turn no matter what we do.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Our Move Options from (6,3)\n\nNeighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (6,4) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) \u2705 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) \u274c backwards into neck (our own body)\n\nSo three candidates: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2b06\ufe0f Option: UP to (6,4)\n\nLooks safe *this* turn:\n- New body: (6,4),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)  \n\nFrom (6,4) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,5) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3) = backwards \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) = our body \u274c  \n\nSo we\u2019d have **only two legal choices**, and here\u2019s the nasty trap:\n\nIf future-us ever goes **UP to (6,5)**:\n- From (6,5), neighbors are:\n  - UP \u2192 (6,6) our body \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,4) backwards \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,5) enemy body \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,5) our body \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s an **instant self-checkmate** on the following turn. One wrong click and we\u2019re dead. Do we really want to stand on a square where 1 of 2 moves is auto-throw? Nah. \ud83d\ude24\n\nAlso: UP doesn\u2019t give us apples right away, and leaves the bottom underpass completely open for later.\n\nVerdict: technically safe now, but super fragile and easy to misplay later. Pass. \u274c\n\n---\n\n### \u2b05\ufe0f Option: LEFT to (5,3)\n\nIf we go LEFT:\n- New body: (5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)\n\nFrom (5,3) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (5,4) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,2) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,3) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) backwards \u274c  \n\nSo we\u2019d have **3 decent options**. That\u2019s nice. But what\u2019s the macro impact?\n\n- We drift **toward** the enemy side, sure, but:\n  - We don\u2019t grab an apple.\n  - We don\u2019t strengthen the vertical wall.\n  - We walk into a more crowded left-center where their body already runs down column 5 (5,5\u20135,8).\n\nIs it aggressive? Kinda. But are we actually *improving* our winning conditions? Not really. We\u2019re just giving up clean control over the right and not gaining a real trap yet.\n\nVerdict: playable, but strategically meh compared to farming bottom-right and extending our wall. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n### \u2b07\ufe0f Option: DOWN to (6,2) \u2705\n\nIf we go DOWN:\n- New body (no apple):  \n  - (6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)  \n  - Tail (6,9) disappears.\n\nOur wall afterward:\n- Column 6: y = 2,3,6,7,8  \n- Column 7: y = 3\u20136  \n\nStill a **huge vertical barrier**. We\u2019ve just shifted the top down by one, but enemy is miles away; they need many turns to approach the mid gap at (6,4)/(6,5).\n\nFrom (6,2) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,3) backwards \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1) = APPLE \ud83d\ude0b  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,2) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) = APPLE \ud83d\ude0b  \n\nSo we keep **3 solid options**, and two of them are **free food**. What does this do for us?\n\n- Marches us toward a **cluster of apples**: (7,2),(7,1),(6,1),(9,0),(4,0).\n- Extends the wall **downward** toward closing the underpass.\n- Keeps us **far from the enemy** while they\u2019re still stuck in that top-left prison.\n- Gives us more length to later build a full cage and engineer a **forced collision** when we want it.\n\nEnemy, from (4,9), needs ~6\u20138 turns of careful routing just to threaten the mid gap. In that time?\n- We can go (6,2) \u2192 (7,2)/(6,1)/(7,1), scarf multiple apples, and still have time to climb back up and patch (6,4)/(6,5) if needed.\n- Meanwhile we keep their only real crossing options either:\n  - Through the still-far-away mid gap, or  \n  - Way down under our wall near y=0, where we can ambush later.\n\nVerdict: **SAFE**, **expansive**, **apple-rich**, and keeps our macro-plan of board dominance alive. \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Long-Term Evil Plan (Future Me, READ THIS)\n\n- This turn: **DOWN to (6,2)**.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Prioritize apples around **(7,2), (7,1), (6,1)** to grow huge while keeping the column-6/7 barrier mostly intact.\n  - Extend our body down the right side of that wall, aiming to eventually **seal the bottom underpass** so they *cannot* cross under without walking into us.\n- Meanwhile:\n  - Farm right-side apples: (8,4),(8,5),(9,6),(9,3),(9,0) once we swing back up the right.\n  - Watch if enemy starts slithering down the left edge; when they commit toward the bottom to escape, we **cut them off** and:\n    - Either box them into a tiny pocket until they crash into our body,  \n    - Or force a **head-on** where both die and we win on apples (we\u2019re already up 8\u20136 and plan to widen that lead).\n- Priority: stay alive, get fatter, keep right side ours, and slowly choke their movement until they have literally no safe squares left. Then we cash in the checkmate \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re not losing value, just reordering the snacks.\n\nDOWN gives us **apple + flexibility**, which is exactly what we want.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Long-term plan for Future Me\n\nYo future me, listen up:\n\n- **This turn:** go **DOWN to (6,1)** for the free apple.\n- **Next few turns:**\n  - Farm the bottom-right cluster: (7,1) \u2192 (7,2) in some order, maybe then drift toward (8,4), (8,5), (9,3), (9,6), (9,0).\n  - Keep extending that **column 6\u20137 fortress** downward and across the bottom so the enemy **can\u2019t sneak under us** to the right side.\n- Watch the enemy:\n  - They\u2019re at (3,9); if they start dropping down the left, we\u2019ll already be huge and can swing back up to seal any mid/bottom gap.\n  - Goal is to **own the entire right & bottom**, then slowly choke them into a corner and force:\n    - Either a **panic crash into our body**, or  \n    - A **head-on collision we win on apples** once our lead is big enough.\n\nStay alive, keep eating, keep the wall thick, and make them SUFFER when they finally realize there\u2019s nowhere left to go \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Enemy\u2019s chilling way up at **(2,9)**. Time to think like a *predator*, not a fruit collector.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (6,1)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,2)**  \n  - That\u2019s literally our own neck segment. Moving backwards is instant self-KO. \u274c\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,0)**  \n  - On-board, empty, safe this turn. \u2705  \n  - But then we\u2019re stuck on the bottom edge with only:\n    - LEFT \u2192 (5,0)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (7,0)  \n  - Just **2 options next turn**, no apple, and we\u2019re hugging the wall = easier to get boxed later. Meh.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,1)**  \n  - Empty, not our body, not enemy, fully safe. \u2705  \n  - Next turn we\u2019d have:\n    - UP \u2192 (5,2) (open lane toward the center)\n    - DOWN \u2192 (5,0)\n    - LEFT \u2192 (4,1)  \n  - **3 good exits**, and we drift **toward the enemy side** rather than away.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,1)**  \n  - Apple \ud83c\udf4e, safe. \u2705  \n  - We\u2019d grow to 10\u20136 and solidify our right-side wall.\n  - Next moves: UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), RIGHT (8,1) \u2192 also **3 options**.\n\nSo **safe moves**: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is suicide.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Positional choice: farm or choke?\n\nNow the real question:  \nDo we farm the free apple on the **right** or slide **left** to start *boxing this dude in*?\n\n- **RIGHT (7,1)**:\n  - +1 apple, but we drift **away** from the opponent.\n  - We keep inflating the **already-dominant right side**, but don\u2019t pressure his escape routes.\n  - He still has the whole **left and center** to slither down later and scale up.\n\n- **LEFT (5,1)**:\n  - No apple this turn, but:\n    - We move **closer to the enemy**.\n    - We open a clean vertical lane through the **center** (5,2 \u2192 5,3 \u2192 5,4 \u2192 5,5 \u2192 5,6).\n    - That\u2019s exactly where we can build a **midboard wall** to cut off his descent.\n  - Remember the rules we live by:\n    - \u201cDo not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\u201d  \n    - \u201cGrow as a means of dominating the board.\u201d  \n  - LEFT does *both*: keeps us safe **and** increases our ability to dominate the **central choke point**.\n\n- **DOWN (6,0)**:\n  - No apple, fewer follow-ups, and it doesn\u2019t help trap him at all. This is just wasting tempo on the bottom edge.\n\nWe\u2019re already **ahead 9\u20136**. We don\u2019t need to greed every apple; we need to **own the map** and set up the eventual kill or winning head-on when the time comes.\n\nSo we take the **more aggressive, positional option**: slide **LEFT toward center** and start preparing the cage.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Plan for Future Me (listen up, you cracked gamer)\n\n- From **(5,1)**, look to swing **UP through the middle lanes**:\n  - Build a vertical presence around x=4\u20135, y=3\u20136.\n  - Goal: create a **central barricade** beneath the enemy\u2019s body at (5,6) / (5,7) / (5,8).\n- While we do that:\n  - Keep an eye on whether they go **LEFT for apples** (0-column) or **DOWN toward mid**.\n  - If they drift down, we\u2019re in perfect position to:\n    - Either box them into the **upper-left**, or  \n    - Force a **head-on collision** later from a position of strength (we\u2019ll still be up on apples).\n- Right-side apples (7,1), 7,2, 8,4, 8,5, 9,3, 9,6, 9,0?  \n  - They\u2019re not going anywhere.

Let\u2019s scan all four moves and see who\u2019s trolling and who\u2019s clutch \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate all directions from (5,1)\n\n**UP \u2192 (5,2)**  \n- In-bounds \u2705  \n- Not our body \u2705  \n- Not enemy body \u2705  \n- Safe this turn.  \n- Next options from there: (5,3), (4,2) \u2014 solid central lane toward midboard.  \n- Moves us **closer to enemy** vertically and toward mid-right apples.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5,0)**  \n- In-bounds \u2705  \n- Empty \u2705  \n- Next turn options: (4,0), (6,0) \u2014 just **2 real outs** (can\u2019t go back to (5,1)).  \n- Hugs the **bottom wall**, drifts us away from the fight. Playing scared, not our style \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4,1)**  \n- In-bounds \u2705  \n- Empty \u2705  \n- Next turn options: (4,2), (4,0), (3,1) \u2192 **3 exits**, nice and flexible.  \n- Pulls us **toward the opponent\u2019s side** (x shrinking from 5 \u2192 4).  \n- Keeps huge open space on the **left and center** available for us to snake through and start building that mid-board cage.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6,1)**  \n- That\u2019s literally our own neck.  \n- Moving backwards = instant self-KO \ud83d\udc80\u274c\n\nSo **safe options**: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.  \nRIGHT is trolling and we\u2019re not throwing for content\u2026 yet \ud83d\ude02\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move is actually *dominant*?\n\nWe\u2019re up **9\u20137** on apples. If we can eventually force a **head-on trade**, we **win the double KO** as long as we don\u2019t let them outscale us. So what do we want?\n\n- Stay alive \u2705  \n- Keep **lots of future options** \u2705  \n- Drift **toward the enemy**, not away \u2705  \n- Shape the board so we can **box them in** later \u2705\n\nCompare:\n\n- **DOWN (5,0)**  \n  - Fewer outs, further from enemy, hugging bottom.  \n  - Zero pressure, zero choke potential. That\u2019s a retreat move. \u274c\n\n- **UP (5,2)**  \n  - Aggressive toward mid, closer vertically.  \n  - Good if we want to build a vertical wall around x=5.  \n  - But enemy\u2019s at **x=1** and will likely snake **down the left side** (x0\u20132). We\u2019d still be a bit far horizontally.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1)**  \n  - Gets us **one step closer horizontally** to the enemy\u2019s file (5\u21924 vs their 1).  \n  - Opens up a beautiful path into **center-left** where they\u2019re most likely to drop once they leave the top row.  \n  - From there we can:\n    - Climb up through (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,4)\u2026  \n    - Start threatening to **cut off their descent path** as they come down from the top-left for those column-0 apples.\n\nUP and LEFT both move us closer, but **LEFT aligns us better with where they\u2019re GOING**, not just where they ARE. That\u2019s how you trap, right chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nSo between UP and LEFT, the more *strategically vicious* move is **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Plan for Future Me (yo, don\u2019t forget this \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d)\n\n- From **(4,1)**:\n  - Look to push **UP into 4,2 \u2192 4,3 \u2192 4,4** to claim the **center-left vertical lane**.\n  - Watch which way enemy head at (1,9) goes:\n    - If they drop **DOWN** toward (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), we\u2019ll already be sliding up the left-center to start closing the jaws from below.\n    - If they go hard **LEFT to the wall** and farm the 0-column apples, we can mirror up the **x3\u20134 band** and set up a later squeeze from the right side of their territory.\n- Maintain a shape that:\n  - Keeps our **right-side wall** intact as fallback.\n  - Extends our influence into **mid-left**, so when they finally try to rotate toward center, they\u2019re staring at our body and not free space.\n- Remember: we\u2019re up **9\u20137**. If a clean **head-on collision** becomes available later with no risky apple swing, we can absolutely take that trade and win the game on the spot \ud83d\udca5\n\nTime to drift left and start setting the trap \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s how you self-box and die.  \n- More length, worse position = not worth it. We\u2019re already ahead on score.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3,1)**  \n- Safe cell \u2705  \n- Next turn we\u2019d have **3 outs** (UP 3,2 / DOWN 3,0 / LEFT 2,1).  \n- Pulls us toward the enemy\u2019s side, but keeps us hugging the bottom row longer.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5,1)**  \n- Directly backwards into our neck = **instant self-KO** \ud83d\udc80  \n- Auto-throw.

Pass.\n\n- **LEFT to (3,1)**  \n  - Good, aggressive, keeps 3 outs.  \n  - But still at y=1 hugging the bottom; we\u2019d need an extra tempo just to climb off the floor before we start building the real cage.\n\n- **UP to (4,2)**  \n  - Immediately steps us **off the floor** and into the **center-left vertical lane**.  \n  - From there we can still slide LEFT next turn to 3,2 if we want that left barrier, or keep going UP to stack a wall at x=4.  \n  - Keeps **3 solid exits** every step and doesn\u2019t crowd our own body.\n\nAnd remember: we can reach **(3,2)** in two moves by going UP now then LEFT, ending with basically the same head location as if we went LEFT then UP \u2013 but with better vertical posture and less early wall-hugging. Why not take the cleaner tempo, right? \ud83d\ude09\n\nSo the best balance of **safety, flexibility, and future pressure** is clearly **UP**.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- Keep climbing that **center-left column** (around x=3\u20134).  \n- Watch enemy slither down column 0; they\u2019ll vacuum those left-wall apples and get longer but more cramped.  \n- Our right-side body at x=6\u20137 is already a fat wall; build a **second wall in the mid-left** and look for ways to:\n  - Cut off their escape from the left strip into center.\n  - Force them into either our body or a **future head-on** when we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n- Do **not** over-commit to the bottom row; stay mobile in the mid-board to control both sides.\n\nUP",

We want control, space, and eventually a *kill box* around them.  \n\nBoard reminder:\n- Our head: **(4,2)**\n- Our body wall: mostly around **x=6\u20137**, y **1\u20136**\n- Enemy head: **(0,8)**\n- Enemy body: big line across the **top row** and a hook down to **(4,8\u20139,5,8)**\n\nWe gotta choose between **UP**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT** (DOWN is instant throw).\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (4,2)\n\n### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (4,3)\n- In bounds \u2705  \n- Not our body \u2705  \n- Not enemy \u2705  \n- No way for heads to clash this turn \u2705  \n- We **don\u2019t eat an apple**, so tail moves and frees up (7,6) \u2013 no weird body overlaps.\n\nNew shape after UP:\n- Head: **(4,3)**\n- Body: (4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5)\n\nNext turn from (4,3), we\u2019ll have:\n- **UP \u2192 (4,4)** (open)\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,3)** (open)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)** (open)\n\nThat\u2019s **3 juicy outs** and we\u2019re building a **central vertical pillar at x=4**. Great for future box setups \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (4,1)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck.  \n- Direct backwards move = **instant self-KO** \ud83d\udc80  \n- Auto-delete. No.\n\n---\n\n### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (3,2)\n- In bounds \u2705  \n- Empty cell \u2705  \n- No enemy there \u2705  \n- No apple, so tail still moves \u2705  \n\nAfter LEFT:\n- Head: **(3,2)**\n- Body: (4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5)\n\nNext turn options from (3,2):\n- UP \u2192 (3,3) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1) (open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) is **backwards** \u274c\n\nSo also **3 safe outs**. This pulls us a bit closer to the left side and to those apples at (1,3), (0,3). Aggressive, still safe. Not bad at all.\n\n---\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (5,2)\n- In bounds \u2705  \n- Empty \u2705  \n- No enemy \u2705  \n\nAfter RIGHT:\n- Head: **(5,2)**\n- Body: (4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5)\n\nNext turn from (5,2):\n- UP \u2192 (5,3) (open) \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,2) (**backwards**) \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,1) (our own body) \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2) (our own body) \u274c  \n\nSo from (5,2) we\u2019d have **only ONE legal move** next turn. \ud83d\ude2c  \nThat\u2019s how you slowly walk yourself into a coffin. We *do not* want to sit pinned between our own right-side wall and the bottom.\n\nRIGHT is technically safe now, but it\u2019s **positionally trash** for future turns. Hard pass.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move best sets up the BOX? \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc0d\n\nWe\u2019re choosing between **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\nBig goals:\n- Stay **very alive** (duh).\n- Keep **3+ future options** as often as possible.\n- Build a **mid-board wall** to trap them on the left strip.\n- Eventually force them into:\n  - our body, or  \n  - a **head-on collision** while we\u2019re still ahead on apples \ud83d\ude08  \n\n### Comparing UP vs LEFT\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely behavior**:\n- From (0,8), they can go:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,7) \ud83c\udf4e (super likely, safe and greedy)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) (safe, no apple)\n- If they go DOWN, they start **walking down the left column** toward more apples at (0,3),(0,2),(0,1),(0,0).\n\nSo we want to:\n- Control the **center-left columns (x=3\u20134)**.\n- Be ready around **y=3\u20135** when they\u2019re coming down to 0,3.\n\nDistance-wise, both moves are equal:\n- From (4,2) to (0,3): Manhattan distance = 5.\n- UP \u2192 (4,3): then distance to (0,3) = 4.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2): then distance to (0,3) = 4.\n\nSo **tempo to the fight is the same** either way. The difference is **shape**.\n\n**If we go LEFT**:\n- Head at (3,2), our body stretches rightwards.\n- We start building a **low horizontal bar** at y=2.\n- That doesn\u2019t directly wall off the enemy\u2019s path from the left side into the mid-board; it's more like cutting bottom vs top.\n\n**If we go UP**:\n- Head at (4,3), with (4,2),(4,1) under us.\n- We\u2019re starting a **vertical spine at x=4**.\n- That spine can become the **center barrier** between left strip and right side:\n  - Enemy stuck on left wall?  \n  - We own mid and right?  \n  - We slowly compress them into a smaller and smaller corridor?  \n  - Eventually they misstep into our body or we offer a head-on trade while we\u2019re still up? \ud83e\udde0\n\nUP also keeps us a touch more **central**, giving flexibility:\n- Want to push left later? Go LEFT from (4,3) to (3,3).\n- Want to pivot right to threaten apples or re-route around our own body? We still have that angle too.\n\nGiven:\n- RIGHT is a positional trap,\n- DOWN is suicide,\n- LEFT is okay but builds more horizontal,\n- **UP builds the central vertical cage we\u2019ve been planning**,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **UP is the best move** here.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcd3\n\n- Keep scaling that **x=4 vertical column** upward: (4,3) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,5) when safe.\n- Once we\u2019re around **y=4\u20135**, start **leaning LEFT** to x=3 and x=2 to contest apples and space near (1,3),(0,3).\n- Watch enemy:\n  - If they keep sliding straight down column 0, meet them around **y=3\u20134** with our head and body already framing the mid-board.\n  - If they ever step right off the wall (toward x=1\u20132), tighten the net and look for a **forced corridor** where their only safe moves drift them into our body.\n- Always avoid over-filling x=4 from bottom to top with solid body; keep at least one **loop path** open so we can swing between left and right halves.\n- If a clean **head-on collision** opportunity arises while we\u2019re still **ahead in apples**, happily take the trade: double KO wins for us on score \ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s run the options:\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four directions from (4,3)\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,2)**  \n  That\u2019s straight back into our own neck. Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n  \u279c **Illegal / suicide. Toss it.**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,4)**  \n  In bounds \u2705  \n  Not our body \u2705  \n  Not enemy \u2705  \n  No apples (so tail moves as normal) \u2705  \n\n  After moving **UP**, our new body is:\n  - Head: **(4,4)**\n  - Body: (4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4)\n\n  From that future head **(4,4)**, our next-turn options:\n  - UP \u2192 (4,5) \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,4) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,4) \u2705  \n  - DOWN is backwards \u274c  \n\n  So we keep **3 solid outs** and build a **vertical spine at x=4**, right in the center. That\u2019s a perfect future wall to cut the board in half and squeeze the enemy on the left. \ud83d\udd25\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,3)**  \n  In bounds \u2705  \n  Empty \u2705  \n\n  New body:\n  - Head: **(3,3)**\n  - Body: (4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4)\n\n  From **(3,3)**:\n  - UP \u2192 (3,4) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,2) \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,3) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT is backwards into (4,3) \u274c  \n\n  Also **3 outs**. This pulls us slightly toward the left apples and the enemy\u2019s lane\u2026 but gives up a bit of central height compared to hard climbing.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)**  \n  In bounds \u2705  \n  Empty \u2705  \n\n  New body:\n  - Head: **(5,3)**\n  - Body: (4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4)\n\n  From **(5,3)**:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,4) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,2) \u2705  \n  - LEFT is backwards \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) is our own body \u274c  \n\n  That\u2019s only **2 safe moves** next turn. Plus it pushes us **toward our own right wall** at x=6\u20137, shrinking our maneuver space. That\u2019s how you slowly get coffin-locked, and we\u2019re not doing that. \ud83d\udeab\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where is the ENEMY likely going?\n\nEnemy head at **(0,7)**, body trailing up and across the top. Their legal moves:\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,6)**: empty and safe, keeps them on the left wall.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,7)**: also empty and safe, edges them toward center and apples at (1,6),(3,7).\n\nEither way, they\u2019re still **far** from us this turn. None of our options (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) can cause a head-on this move, and none walk into their body. So this is all about **positioning for the eventual box**.\n\nWe want:\n- A **central wall** that they can\u2019t cross without risking death.\n- Lots of **future options** so we never get trapped by our own tail.\n- To stay big and happy so if we *do* line up a head-on, we win the trade while ahead in apples.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs LEFT \u2013 which builds the better cage? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LEFT to (3,3)**:\n- Slightly closer to the left apples (0,3), (1,3), etc.\n- Helps press toward their side, but our main \u201cspine\u201d would still sit mostly at x=4 and right.\n\n**UP to (4,4)**:\n- Extends that **vertical pillar at x=4**: (4,1\u20134).  \n- Dominates the **middle of the board**, making it harder for them to ever escape the left strip if we later shift a bit left at higher y.\n- Keeps us perfectly central so we can branch:\n  - LEFT later to close the net around them, or  \n  - RIGHT to farm if they stall.\n\nGiven we\u2019re already ahead **9\u20138**, we want a **clean, fat, safe shape** that can tighten around them over several turns. UP gives us:\n- Maximum flexibility (3 good outs).\n- Best central control.\n- A smoother path to a huge, tall wall that\u2019s ideal for boxing them in later.\n\n\u279c **UP is the strongest, most ruthless positioning move here.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Long-term plan for future me\n\n- Keep climbing the **x=4 spine** upward: (4,4) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,6), as long as it stays safe.\n- Once we\u2019re around **y=5\u20136**, start probing **LEFT** to x=3\u20132 to compress the enemy\u2019s space on the left half.\n- Watch them drop down the left wall; be ready to:\n  - Seal lanes with our body so their only \u201csafe\u201d moves drift into a dead-end.\n  - Snap off a **head-on collision** only if we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and can force a trade.\n- Don\u2019t over-seal ourselves: always maintain at least one **loop or escape corridor** behind our front so we never get boxed in by our own tail.\n\nUP",

Instant self-KO.  \n  \u279c \ud83d\udeab **Illegal / suicide.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,4)**  \n  In bounds \u2705, empty \u2705.  \n  If we go here, tail (7,4) pops off, new body ends at (7,3).  \n  Next turn from (3,4) we\u2019d have:\n  - UP \u2192 (3,5) \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,4) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,3) \u2705  \n  Three outs, solid. Also drifts toward the enemy side.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)**  \n  In bounds \u2705, empty \u2705.  \n  From (5,4) next:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,5) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,3) \u2705  \n  Also three outs. But this walks us into the side where our own body already lives (5\u20137, y=1\u20133). Long-term, that\u2019s how you get slowly squeezed against the right wall. Meh.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,5)**  \n  In bounds \u2705, empty \u2705.  \n  Tail (7,4) leaves, new body ends at (7,3). New shape:\n  - Head: (4,5)\n  - Spine at x=4 from y=1\u20135, plus that right-side chunk.\n\n  Next turn from (4,5):\n  - UP \u2192 (4,6) \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,5) \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) \u2705  \n  Three clean outs, and we extend a **central vertical wall**.\n\nSo immediate safety: **LEFT, RIGHT, UP all safe**; DOWN is death.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head at **(0,6)**, neck at **(0,7)**.\n\nPossible moves:\n- **UP \u2192 (0,7)** is backwards into neck \u279c illegal \u274c  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (-1,6)** is off-board \u279c illegal \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,5)** \u279c legal \u2705, empty  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,6)** \u279c legal \u2705, and that\u2019s an apple \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo they must choose between:\n- **DOWN to (0,5)** to keep hugging the wall, or  \n- **RIGHT to (1,6)** to grab that apple and move toward center.\n\nEither way, they\u2019re still **far** from us. No move we pick this turn can cause a head-on or us hitting their body. So this turn is **pure positioning**.\n\nWe\u2019re up **9\u20138**, so a future **head-on trade is GOOD for us** (if both die with that score, we win). Our job now is to steer the geometry toward a future forced joust or box.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic vibes \u2013 which move tightens the noose?\n\nOur goals:\n- Keep **max options** open (don\u2019t self-box).\n- Build a **central wall** so the enemy is stuck playing on the left.\n- Grow enough that if we force a collision, we\u2019re happy with the trade.\n\nCompare the good options:\n\n#### RIGHT\n- Pulls us toward our existing body cluster on the right.\n- Long-term, risks shrinking our free space as we curve into the right wall.\n- Doesn\u2019t pressure the enemy\u2019s lane at all.\n\nRIGHT feels too cozy, not killer. \u2744\ufe0f\n\n#### LEFT\n- Steps toward the enemy side, yes.\n- Opens fresh space on the left, good for aggression.\n- But it starts shifting our \u201cspine\u201d off of perfect center before we\u2019ve built enough height.\n\nWe *do* want to go left eventually\u2014but ideally **after** we\u2019ve extended that central pillar up a little more.\n\n#### UP\n- Extends our **vertical spine at x=4** to y=5.\n- Keeps us perfectly central with **three clean exits next turn**.\n- Makes it easier later to:\n  - Go LEFT at high y to press them against the left wall, or  \n  - Swing RIGHT if they somehow slip out.\n\nUP keeps our shape clean and powerful: a big central wall they\u2019ll eventually have to run around or die trying. That\u2019s exactly the geometry you want when you\u2019re slightly ahead and hunting for either:\n- a **box**, or  \n- a **profitable head-on collision**.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both are good; UP is just the **cleaner, more flexible foundation** for the trap we\u2019re building.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Long-term plan for future me\n\n- Keep **climbing the central spine**: aim for (4,5) \u2192 (4,6) as long as enemy can\u2019t suddenly cut us off.\n- Once we\u2019re around **y=6**, start drifting **LEFT** (to x=3 then x=2) to squeeze their space on the left half.\n- Watch how they choose between:\n  - Going RIGHT to contest center (great, we line up a joust), or  \n  - Staying glued to the wall (great, we box them in).\n- Remember: we\u2019re ahead on apples, so if a **clean, forced head-on** presents itself in a corridor we control, we snap-take it.\n\nUP",

Our body is a chunky central/right pillar, enemy is still clinging to the left edge.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from our head (4,5)\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,4)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck segment. Instant self-KO.  \n  \u2192 Illegal / suicide. Toss it.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,5)**  \n  In bounds, currently empty.  \n  If we go here, tail (7,3) comes off, new tail becomes (6,3).  \n  Next turn from (3,5) we\u2019d have:\n  - UP \u2192 (3,6) safe  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,5) safe  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,4) safe  \n  Three exits, good flexibility, slightly closer to enemy side.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)**  \n  In bounds, empty.  \n  From (5,5) next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,6) safe  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) safe  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,4) safe  \n  Also three exits, but this drifts us further right, away from the enemy. That cedes central control and makes it harder to box them later.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  In bounds, empty.  \n  Tail (7,3) falls off, new tail becomes (6,3).  \n  Then our shape is a **solid vertical pillar at x=4 from y=1 up to y=6**, plus the right-side chunk at (5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3).  \n  From (4,6) next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (4,7) safe  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,6) safe  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,6) safe  \n  Again, three clean exits and great central dominance.\n\nSo safe moves this turn: **LEFT, RIGHT, UP.**  \nDOWN is the troll move that ends the stream.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head at **(0,5)**, neck at **(0,6)** (so they can\u2019t go back up).\n\nFrom (0,5):\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,5): off-board \u2192 illegal  \n- UP \u2192 (0,6): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,4)**: legal, empty  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,5)**: legal, empty, and lines them up near that apple at (1,6) next turn\n\nSo they realistically choose between:\n- **DOWN to (0,4)** to keep sliding down the left wall into that stack of apples, or  \n- **RIGHT to (1,5)** to start moving toward center and that (1,6) apple.\n\nEither way, nothing they do this turn can collide with us. This turn is pure positioning.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move best sets up the kill?\n\nWe\u2019re ahead **9\u20138**. If we can eventually force a clean **head-on trade**, we like that; if both snakes die with us still up on apples, we win. So we want:\n\n- Central control\n- Lots of future options\n- A shape that can **box them against the left wall** or force a joust on our terms\n\nCompare our safe moves:\n\n### RIGHT (5,5)\n- Walks us away from the fight.\n- Gives the enemy more open center to slip into.\n- Still safe, but it\u2019s the \u201ccoward to the corner\u201d line. Not our style, and strategically weaker for boxing.\n\n### LEFT (3,5)\n- Pulls us closer to the enemy side, which is good for aggression.\n- Keeps three future exits open.\n- But our tall central pillar only reaches up to y=5; we haven\u2019t fully extended it yet. If the enemy steps into the interior, we\u2019d rather already have that pillar at y=6 to cut lanes more effectively.\n\n### UP (4,6)\n- Extends our **central wall** at x=4 by another row, now y=1 through y=6.\n- Keeps us perfectly central with three good options next turn.\n- Works great whether the enemy goes RIGHT or DOWN:\n  - If they go **RIGHT to (1,5)**, we\u2019re at (4,6) and can then start drifting LEFT from a higher, stronger position to choke their approach.\n  - If they go **DOWN to (0,4)**, they\u2019re farming low-left while we build an enormous mid-board barrier that will let us wrap around and box them later.\n\nUP also stays consistent with the long-term trap we started last turn: build a tall center spine first, then swing left to squeeze.\n\nBetween LEFT and UP, both are workable, but UP gives us:\n- A taller, more oppressive central pillar\n- At least as many safe follow-ups\n- Better future geometry for either a box or a favorable head-on\n\nSo we play it solid and mean: **keep climbing the pillar.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(4,6)**, keep extending the central spine upward as long as it\u2019s safe (toward (4,7)), to make that x=4 wall massive.\n- Watch where the enemy goes:\n  - If they step **RIGHT** toward center, start drifting **LEFT** from high y (to x=3, then x=2) to meet them and narrow their lanes, aiming for a forced corridor or head-on where we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n  - If they keep sliding **DOWN** the left wall to farm apples, use our central dominance to curve around them and close off their escape routes from above or the right.\n- Always preserve at least two safe moves each turn; don\u2019t overcommit into tight corners just for a flashy clash unless the trade is clearly winning on apple count.\n\nUP",

Instant self-KO \u274c  \n  \u2192 Throw it out.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  In bounds, currently empty.  \n  If we go here (no apple), tail at **(6,3)** moves up to **(6,2)**.  \n  Next turn from (3,6) we\u2019d have:\n  - UP \u2192 (3,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,6)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,5)  \n  Three safe outs, strong, slightly closer to the enemy side.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)**  \n  In bounds, empty.  \n  Next turn from (5,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (5,7)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,5)  \n  Also three outs, but this drifts us **away** from the fight and weakens our box potential. Feels too passive.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,7)**  \n  In bounds, empty.  \n  Tail moves from **(6,3)** to **(6,2)**.  \n  After that, we\u2019ve got a **huge vertical wall at x=4 from y=1 up to y=7**.  \n  Next turn from (4,7):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - UP \u2192 (4,8)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)  \n  Again, three clean outs and we strengthen the central spine.\n\nSo **safe options**: **LEFT, RIGHT, UP**.  \n**DOWN** is trolling and we\u2019re not throwing for content today \ud83d\ude02\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy cooking? \ud83c\udf73\n\nEnemy head at **(0,4)**, body stacked up the left wall.\n\nFrom (0,4) they can:\n\n- UP \u2192 (0,5) = backwards into own body \u2192 illegal \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,4) = off-board \u2192 illegal \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,3)** = apple \ud83c\udf4e, they grow to 9 apples (tie us)  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,4)** = safe, no apple, they stay at 8\n\nSo they either:\n- Farm DOWN for apples and hug the left wall, **or**\n- Step RIGHT toward the interior to escape the box.\n\nNothing they do this turn can touch us, no head-on threat this move.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move best builds the box? \ud83d\udce6\n\nOur goals:\n- Stay alive (obvious \ud83d\ude05)\n- Keep **multiple future outs**\n- Grow and **control space**\n- Use our **apple lead** to eventually force a trade or trap\n\nCompare the safe moves:\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)\n- Safe, flexible.\n- But it cedes central control and drifts us away from the enemy.\n- Harder to box them in later. Too cozy, not ruthless enough.\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (3,6)\n- Pulls us **toward** the enemy side, keeps 3 exits, good aggression.\n- Nice line into the **(3,7)** apple next turn.\n- But it doesn\u2019t strengthen the **main wall** that\u2019s already slicing the board at x=4.\n\n#### UP \u2192 (4,7)\n- Extends our **central pillar** at x=4 from y=1 \u2192 y=7. That\u2019s HUGE.\n- We\u2019re building a nearly full-height wall that splits the board into **left** (their prison) and **right** (our playground).\n- Still gives us three clean exits and a line into the same **(3,7)** apple next turn.\n- Also increases distance to an immediate head-on if the enemy comes toward center, giving us more control over **when** to force the clash.\n\nStrategically, for a long-term **box on the left side**, UP is the premium move:\n- It pushes us toward sealing the **top crossing** over our wall.\n- The enemy ends up stuck working **below or left** of this huge spine.\n- We stay central and can later swing left across the top to cap them off.\n\nSo we stay **disciplined and cruel**: build the wall higher, then squeeze. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(4,7)**, look to:\n  - Either go **LEFT to (3,7)** to grab the apple and start forming a **horizontal ceiling** over the enemy\u2019s side, or  \n  - Go **UP to (4,8)** if we need even more vertical security first.\n- Watch if enemy goes **DOWN** (farming left wall) vs **RIGHT** (escaping inward):\n  - If they keep sliding down the wall, we complete the x=4 wall to the top and then later close the bottom, boxing them into a narrow left strip.\n  - If they step right into the interior, we use our central pillar + higher apple count to herd them into tight corridors and eventually set up a **favorable head-on** or a clean body-block kill.\n- Always keep at least **two safe escape squares** each turn; don\u2019t seal ourselves on the wrong side of our own wall.\n\nUP",

Instant self-KO. \u274c  \n  \u2192 Illegal / throw move.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)**  \n  In bounds, empty. Safe this turn.  \n  But: no apple, and it drifts us away from the enemy and away from central control. Also we\u2019d go to **9 apples** while enemy goes to **10**, giving them the scoreboard edge. Meh.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,8)**  \n  In bounds, empty, safe.  \n  Extends our vertical wall to **x=4, y=1\u20138**. Very nice shape control.  \n  But again, no apple: we\u2019d be at **9**, enemy almost certainly at **10** (they\u2019re sitting next to two apples). That flips the \u201chead-on tiebreak\u201d in *their* favor. Not ideal.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  There\u2019s an apple at **(3,7)**. No snake body there. Safe.  \n  We\u2019d **grow to length 11**, hit **10 apples**, and keep our vertical column at x=4 intact behind us.\n\nSo the only bad move is **DOWN**. **UP / LEFT / RIGHT** are all safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head at **(0,3)**:\n\n- UP \u2192 (0,4): into its own body \u2192 illegal \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,3): off-board \u2192 illegal \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,2)**: apple \ud83c\udf4e, totally legal  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,3)**: apple \ud83c\udf4e, totally legal\n\nSo they **must** eat an apple this turn, no matter what:\n- After their move, they will have **10 apples**.\n\nIf **we don\u2019t** eat, we fall to **9\u201310** behind on score.  \nIf **we do** eat, we stay **tied 10\u201310**, and keep pace in length and tiebreaks.\n\nThey cannot possibly reach **(3,7)**, **(4,8)**, or **(5,7)** in one move, so no head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term shape: which move actually cooks them? \ud83d\udd25\n\nOur goals:\n- Stay alive.\n- Stay at least even in apples.\n- Build a shape that **boxes them on the left** and gives us more board.\n\nCompare the good moves:\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)\n- Safe, but:\n  - Loses central dominance.\n  - Hands them the **score lead (9\u201310)**.\n  - Slows our pressure completely.\n- This is the \u201cscared\u201d move. We\u2019re not scared.\n\n### UP \u2192 (4,8)\n- Strengthens our vertical wall (x=4, y=1\u20138).\n- Keeps 3 good outs next turn.\n- But: no apple, so we go to **9** while they go to **10**.\n- We gain structure but lose scoreboard leverage.\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (3,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n- We **eat an apple**, go to **10 apples**, and grow:\n  - New head: (3,7)\n  - Our wall at x=4 from y=1\u20137 is still intact right behind us.\n- Next turn from **(3,7)** we have:\n  - UP \u2192 (3,8)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,7)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,6)  \n  (RIGHT is backwards into (4,7), so illegal.)\n- So we still have **three solid outs** and a strong central pillar at our back.\n- We also step **onto their side** of the wall, setting up a future **horizontal ceiling** over the left/top if we want to box them tighter.\n\nEnemy likely path:\n- If they go DOWN to (0,2), they\u2019ll keep sliding down the left wall into a vertical tunnel of apples at (0,1) and (0,0).  \n- We, from (3,7), can leisurely extend:\n  - UP/LEFT to form a **top strip**,\n  - or start drifting down inside the left region, always with that x=4 wall as a fallback.\n\nOverall: **LEFT** gives us:\n- Apple parity (stay tied at 10\u201310).\n- More length (11 segments vs 10 if we\u2019d gone UP).\n- Strong central wall preserved.\n- Entry point onto their side to start shaping the box later.\n\nNo immediate collision threat, lots of future options, and we don\u2019t give up the scoreboard.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me\n\nFrom **(3,7)**, prioritize:\n- Keeping **3 escape options** as long as possible (UP / LEFT / DOWN).\n- Watch whether enemy goes:\n  - **DOWN along (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0)**: then we can calmly build a **horizontal bar** around y=7\u20138 on the left side to cap their future upward escape.\n  - **RIGHT to (1,3)**: they\u2019re stepping into the interior; be ready to mirror closer, use our central wall to funnel them into tight corridors, but avoid head-on trades until we either tie or lead in apples.\n- Don\u2019t over-commit too deep left yet; keep our **x=4 spine** connected so we can always retreat right if needed.\n\nLEFT",

Slows our apple tempo while enemy farms bottom-left.\n\n### \u2705 DOWN \u2192 (3,6)\n- In bounds, empty.\n- Safe now.\n- Next turn from (3,6):\n  - Neck is (3,7), so **UP is illegal**.\n  - RIGHT is (4,6) = our own body \u2192 **blocked**.\n  - Only **LEFT (2,6)** or **DOWN (3,5)** \u2192 just **2 outs**.\n- Brings us a bit closer to the mid-board corridor but compresses our options near our own vertical wall. Meh.\n\n### \u2705 LEFT \u2192 (2,7)\n- In bounds, empty.\n- Safe this turn.\n- Next turn from (2,7):\n  - Neck is (3,7), so RIGHT is illegal.\n  - But we still have **3 outs**:\n    - **UP \u2192 (2,8)** (open)\n    - **LEFT \u2192 (1,7)** (open)\n    - **DOWN \u2192 (2,6)** (open)\n- Also **closer to apples**:\n  - To **(1,6)**: distance drops from 3 \u2192 **2**.\n- Keeps our **x=4 wall** right behind us as a big, solid barrier the enemy has to respect. We\u2019re pushing horizontally into the left side while still having space above and below. That\u2019s how you start a box \ud83d\udce6\n\n### \u274c RIGHT \u2192 (4,7)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck.\n- Direct backwards move \u2192 **instant self-KO**.\n- Completely off the table.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy possibilities (no surprise deaths)\n\nEnemy head: **(0,2)**\n\n- UP \u2192 (0,3): backwards into its own body \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,2): off-board \u2192 illegal.\n- \u2705 DOWN \u2192 (0,1): **apple**, safe.\n- \u2705 RIGHT \u2192 (1,2): empty, safe.\n\nSo they either:\n- Go **DOWN** and start hoovering that **bottom-left apple pile**, or  \n- Step **RIGHT** into the interior at (1,2).\n\nEither way, **they\u2019re miles away from (2,7)**, (3,8), or (3,6).  \nNo head-on collision risk this turn with any of our safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move actually sets up the box?\n\nWe want:\n- To **stay alive** (duh).\n- To **keep at least even access to apples** (can\u2019t let them run away with the score).\n- To **maximize future options** so we can **wrap and trap** them later.\n\nComparing our safe moves:\n\n- **UP**: Safe but fewer follow-ups (only 2 outs), drifts away from the nearest apples, and toward their tail area. Good structure, but slow on apples and more rigid.\n- **DOWN**: Also only 2 outs next turn, squeezes us near our own vertical wall, not ideal for long-term flexibility.\n- **LEFT**:\n  - Keeps **3 future directions** open (UP/LEFT/DOWN).\n  - Moves us **toward the central-left apple cluster** (especially (1,6) / (1,3)) so we don\u2019t fall too far behind while they farm bottom-left.\n  - Uses our **x=4 spine** as a backing wall \u2014 perfect to later build a **horizontal band** across the board and start boxing them on the left.\n\nSo the most **aggressive + flexible + apple-friendly** play from here is **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Note to future me (next few turns plan)\n\n- From **(2,7)**, prioritize staying with **3 escape options** as long as possible (UP/LEFT/DOWN).\n- Watch where enemy goes:\n  - If they dive **DOWN** to farm bottom-left, we can:\n    - Gradually drift toward **(1,6)** then **(1,3)** apples,\n    - While using our **x=4 wall** plus a horizontal extension around **y\u22486\u20137** to start carving off a big chunk of left space.\n  - If they go **RIGHT to (1,2)** and enter the interior earlier:\n    - Keep our distance for now but mirror their general direction,\n    - Try to stay **slightly longer** in apples so that when lanes get tight, we can force a **head-on or body-crash** in our favor.\n- Don\u2019t rush into a tight corner on the left edge yet; keep lanes above and below us open so we can pivot based on how greedy they get with those corner apples.\n\nLEFT",

Massive difference.\n- Also moves us toward the **central-left apple line** (1,6, 1,3, etc.) while keeping distance from their head at the bottom-left.\n\n### \ud83e\udd1c Enemy movement this turn\n\nEnemy head at **(0,1)**:\n- UP \u2192 (0,2) is backwards \u2192 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 off-board \u2192 illegal.\n- So:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,0)** (apple) \u2705\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (1,1)** (apple) \u2705\n\nEither way, they\u2019re staying **far from us** this turn:\n- We\u2019re at y=7 region; they\u2019ll be at y=0 or 1.\n- No chance of a **same-cell head-on** with ANY of our safe moves this turn.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Strategic choice\n\nWe want:\n1. **Guaranteed safety this turn.**\n2. **Max future mobility** (more than 2 outs).\n3. **Access to apples** to close the score gap.\n4. Avoid creating a lane where they can later force us into a losing head-on while we\u2019re behind.\n\nComparing:\n- **LEFT (1,7)** \u2192 only 2 exits, stuck hugging their body at x=0.\n- **UP (2,8)** \u2192 only 2 exits, drifting into top wall near their tail.\n- **DOWN (2,6)** \u2192 **3 exits**, central flexibility, and clear paths toward apples without walking into them.\n\nSo the clean, ruthless, *positionally dominant* move here is **DOWN**. We stay mobile in the middle corridor, set up to farm central-left apples, and keep our options wide open for a future box.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(2,6)**:\n  - Default idea: slide toward **(1,6)** apple **if** enemy commits to going **down to (0,0)** then along the bottom. That keeps us ahead in central control and starts closing the apple gap.\n  - If they instead go **RIGHT to (1,1)** and start climbing the interior on x=1:\n    - Be cautious about dropping too low on the left side; keep lanes **at y=5\u20137** open so we can pivot between **(2,6) \u2194 (3,6) \u2194 (2,7)** region, rather than getting pinned.\n- Long-term: use our **x=4 spine** plus a future horizontal extension around **y\u22485\u20137** to carve off a big central chunk. Goal is to make them navigate tight channels near the edges while we stay thick and flexible in the middle. When we\u2019re equal or ahead on apples, *then* we can start aiming for a decisive head-on.\n\ndown",

One bad corridor and we\u2019re cooked later. \u274c\n\n#### \u2705 DOWN \u2192 (2,5)\n- Cell (2,5) is empty, in-bounds, no collision.\n- We don\u2019t eat, so tail moves up (we lose (5,1)).\n- Next turn from **(2,5)**:\n  - BACK \u2192 (2,6) not allowed\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,5) empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,4) empty \u2705  \n- **3 safe outs** next turn, nice flexibility.\n- Also edges us a bit closer to future bottom action vs the enemy.\n\n#### \u2705 LEFT \u2192 (1,6) [APPLE] \ud83c\udf4e\n- Cell (1,6) has an apple, no snake, in-bounds \u2192 **safe AND we grow.**\n- Tail at (5,1) stays one more turn, so we get longer and keep that extra block on the bottom-right of our area.\n- New head: **(1,6)**  \n- Next turn from **(1,6)**:\n  - BACK \u2192 (2,6) not allowed\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,6) = enemy body \u274c\n  - UP \u2192 (1,7) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,5) empty \u2705  \n- **2 safe outs** (UP, DOWN).

We still have a vertical lane to run (x=1), and plenty of room to pivot back toward the center later. Getting fatter while staying safe is exactly how we set up a future box.\n\nSo we **take the apple** and keep building the wall. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Plan to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(1,6)**, ride the **x=1 lane** up or down depending on how the enemy snakes along the bottom:\n  - If they keep pushing right along y=0, we can slowly drift **down the left interior** (1,6 \u2192 1,5 \u2192 1,4...) while looking for a good moment to cut **right toward x=3\u20134** and reinforce that central wall.\n  - Maintain a solid structure with our big spine at **x=4** plus future horizontals around **y\u22484\u20136** to carve out a massive central zone that\u2019s ours.\n- Watch for when their head starts to climb up off the bottom row. When we\u2019re equal or ahead in apples, we can start aiming for routes that **force them into our body** or set up a favorable head-on corridor.\n- For now: grow, thicken our control between x=1\u20134, and do **not** allow ourselves to be pushed into narrow dead-ends vs the left wall.\n\nLEFT",

Score: **we 11, they 12** \u2013 they\u2019re STILL up one apple, so we **DO NOT** want a head-on trade yet. We want control, space, and safe growth \ud83d\udcaa  \n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (1,6)\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (0,6)\n- That\u2019s **enemy body** on the left wall.\n- Moving there = instant death. \u274c\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (2,6)\n- That\u2019s **our own body**, and also directly backwards into our neck.\n- Illegal / suicide. \u274c\n\n### UP \u2192 (1,7)\n- Cell (1,7) is empty, in-bounds. \u2705\n- No apple there.\n- But look at the neighborhood after we move:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,7) = enemy body \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) = our body \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,6) = backwards \u274c  \n  - UP \u2192 (1,8) = **only** safe move \u2705  \n- So if we go UP now, **next turn we are forced UP again**. Zero flexibility. That\u2019s a tight corridor between their wall at x=0 and our own chunk at x=2\u20134. Super linear, no choice.\n\nWe eventually can escape to the right from (1,8) \u2192 (2,8), but that whole sequence gives us **only one legal move for multiple turns**. That\u2019s exactly how you get boxed later. Risky long-term.\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (1,5)\n- Cell (1,5) is empty, in-bounds. \u2705\n- No apple, so tail moves up (we lose (5,1)).\n- After this move our shape is:\n\n  - Head: **(1,5)**\n  - Body: (1,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,1) (tail)\n\n- From **(1,5)** next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (1,6) = backwards \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,5) = enemy body \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) = empty \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,4) = empty \u2705  \n- So we keep **2 clean outs** (RIGHT & DOWN). Way more flexible than the UP line.\n\nAlso, DOWN pulls us **toward the lower interior**, where:\n- There\u2019s an apple at **(1,3)** and a ton of food in the lower-right.\n- Enemy is climbing up from **(1,0)** \u2013 we can stay **just above / to the right** of them, using our giant x=4 wall to dominate the center and stop them from escaping to the big open right side.\n\nGiven our rules:\n- UP = safe but forces a 1-move corridor next turn.\n- DOWN = safe with **multiple safe follow-ups**.\n- No apples either way this turn, so **mobility and future control** decide it.\n\nWe **take DOWN**. We keep options, we keep pressure, and we set up to farm bottom/center later while shadowing the enemy \ud83d\ude08  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Plan to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(1,5)**:\n  - Likely drift **DOWN toward (1,4) \u2192 (1,3)** to scoop that apple if it stays safe.\n  - Use **RIGHT turns (2,5 / 2,4 / 2,3)** to slide toward the middle under our big x=4 pillar.\n- Maintain that **x=4 spine** as a hard wall. Try to grow a horizontal band around **y\u22483\u20134** so enemy struggles to cross from the left-bottom into the right side.\n- Watch the enemy\u2019s path from **(1,0)**:\n  - If they go up the x=1 lane, we stay **one column to the right (x=2\u20133)**, boxing them between our wall and the board edge.\n  - No head-on unless we\u2019re clearly **ahead in apples**.\n- Goal: claim a massive safe region on the **right & center**, keep them squeezed in a smaller pocket on the left/bottom, and then look for a kill window when we\u2019re longer.\n\nDOWN",

They\u2019re up 13\u201311 in apples, so they WANT a trade; we absolutely do not.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Evaluate all four moves\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5): enemy body. Instant death. Out.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5): empty. Legal.\n- UP \u2192 (1,6): our own neck. Directly backwards = auto-lose. Out.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4): empty. Legal.\n\nSo it\u2019s a 2-move decision: RIGHT vs DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 2) What happens if we go DOWN?\n\nMove: (1,5) \u2192 (1,4).\n\nEnemy from (1,1) has:\n- UP \u2192 (1,2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,1)\n\nGiven they\u2019re ahead in score, what do they want? A head-on trade. If we go DOWN, then:\n\n- Likely enemy goes UP to (1,2) to threaten the apple at (1,3).\n- Next turn we\u2019d be at (1,4), they\u2019d be at (1,2).\n  - Our tempting move: DOWN to apple (1,3).\n  - Their tempting move: UP to the same apple (1,3).\n\nIf we ever go for that apple, they can choose to go for it too and force a head-on. Since they\u2019re ahead in apples, that ends the game in their favor. So going DOWN now basically walks us into a future zugzwang where we must avoid the juicy apple to stay alive. Not worth giving them that lever.\n\nYes, we can instead go RIGHT from (1,4) next turn to stay safe, but we\u2019re the ones being pushed around in that line, and we\u2019re staying close to their head in a narrow lane.\n\n---\n\n### 3) What happens if we go RIGHT?\n\nMove: (1,5) \u2192 (2,5).\n\nEnemy from (1,1):\n\n- If they go UP \u2192 (1,2), they set up for the (1,3) apple, but we\u2019re now offset at x=2, y=5. No immediate contested square between our heads.\n- If they go RIGHT \u2192 (2,1), they start the underpass toward the bottom lane, but they\u2019re still far below us.\n\nFrom (2,5) we have:\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) (safe)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) (safe)\n\nSo we still have two clean options, no forced corridor, and we\u2019re drifting toward the giant apple farm on the right side while staying safely above their head. Crucially, RIGHT this turn does not create any obvious future \u201cboth heads race into the same apple\u201d pattern the way DOWN does around (1,3).\n\nWe can\u2019t realistically stop them from eventually slipping under our x=4 wall via the bottom if they commit to it; the geometry just favors them there either way. So our best response is to:\n- Stay higher and more central,\n- Claim right-side apples,\n- Use our x=4 spine plus our future body to shape the battlefield and look for a safe box-in, without ever giving them a cheap head-on.\n\nRIGHT keeps us safe, flexible, and away from their preferred kill setup.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Short plan for future me\n\n- Keep sliding toward the center-right while maintaining altitude above their head; don\u2019t contest (1,3) if it ever lines up as a mutual head-on.\n- Use our existing x=4 wall as a backbone: extend horizontally around mid-board to limit how comfortably they can expand once they emerge from the left/bottom.\n- Watch their head path. If they commit to the bottom underpass, mirror from above and from the right, aiming to tighten a noose of our body around their available space.\n- No head-on trades until we\u2019ve overtaken them in apples and length; right now we play like a predator, not a martyr.\n\nRIGHT",

They WANT a head-on trade. If we ever give them a clean 50/50 collision square, they\u2019ll snap it up and win on apples. We cannot allow that.\n\nLet\u2019s cook through the options.  \n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (2,5)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,6)**  \n  That\u2019s our own body segment (2,6). Slam into ourselves = instant L \u274c  \n  Not happening.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,4)**  \n  Empty right now. No body, no wall, no apple. Currently safe \u2705\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,5)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck, directly behind the head. Moving backwards is auto-death \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,5)**  \n  Empty. No body there. Also safe \u2705\n\nSo once again, we\u2019re in a **2-move game**: **DOWN or RIGHT**.\n\nEnemy from (2,1) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (2,2) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,1) \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,0) \u2705  \n(LEFT is into their own neck at (1,1) so illegal.)\n\nWe must assume they play like a demon: if a head-on ever wins them the game on apples, they\u2019ll take it.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go DOWN to (2,4)\u2026 what happens?\n\nNew head: (2,4). Our body shifts with tail pulling up; from there we\u2019d have:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4) (safe)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) (safe)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) (safe *on the board*, but watch the enemy)\n\nIf enemy this turn goes **UP to (2,2)** (very plausible, climbing toward center):\n\nNext turn we\u2019re at (2,4), they\u2019re at (2,2). Now what?\n\n- If we go **DOWN to (2,3)** and they go **UP to (2,3)** \u2192 \ud83d\udca5 head-on at (2,3).  \n  Who wins that? They have 13 apples, we have 11. We BOTH die, but they win on score. They *want* that square.\n\nSo by going DOWN now, we hand them a future **threat square at (2,3)** that we\u2019re not allowed to step into without suiciding the game. That shrinks our freedom in the center-left corridor and pulls us closer to the trap around the apple at (1,3). Why walk toward their favorite kill zone when we\u2019re behind? \ud83e\udd28\n\nYes, we\u2019d still have LEFT and RIGHT from (2,4), so we\u2019re not *instantly* doomed. But we\u2019d be:\n- Lower on the board,\n- More lined up with their column,\n- Closer to their ideal head-on setups.\n\nThat\u2019s them dictating the fight, not us.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go RIGHT to (3,5)\u2026 how does that look?\n\nMove: (2,5) \u2192 (3,5). New head (3,5). Body shifts; from there:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,5) (backwards, illegal)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) (our own body, illegal)\n- UP \u2192 (3,6) \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,4) \u2705  \n\nSo we still have **two clean exits** next turn: UP and DOWN.\n\nNow check enemy responses this turn:\n\n### Enemy goes UP \u2192 (2,2)\nHeads after move:\n- Us: (3,5)\n- Them: (2,2)\n\nWe\u2019re high, they\u2019re low. Vertical gap of 3. There\u2019s no immediate mutual target square next turn that forces us into a head-on. We can:\n- Go UP to (3,6) and swing toward the big apple field on the right, or  \n- Go DOWN to (3,4) if we want to dip without ever sharing a contested cell.\n\n### Enemy goes RIGHT \u2192 (3,1)\nHeads:\n- Us: (3,5)\n- Them: (3,1)\n\nSame column, but **huge vertical distance** (4 cells). Again, no immediate \u201cboth heads dive into same square\u201d issue. We own the high ground. Think we like being the snake above, ready to swoop across the right side? Oh yeah we do \ud83d\ude08\n\n### Enemy goes DOWN \u2192 (2,0)\nThey tuck even lower. That just gives us more uncontested time to expand on the right half while still threatening to box them in later. Zero immediate head-on threat.\n\nSo **RIGHT**:\n- Keeps us **farther from their head-on traps**,  \n- Maintains **good mobility** (2 solid options next turn),  \n- Drifts us **toward the massive apple cluster on the right** without risking a score-losing trade.\n\nAnd remember: apples aren\u2019t the main focus, but **growing** is how we eventually body them off the board. Right side is our buffet line.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic picture: why RIGHT is better than DOWN\n\nCompare the two:\n\n- **DOWN to (2,4)**:\n  - Lines us up in the same column with them.\n  - Hands them a future kill square at (2,3) they\u2019d gladly trade on.\n  - Creeps us toward (1,3), another potential mutual contest we must avoid.\n  - Keeps us more in the cramped left-center zone.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**:\n  - Keeps us **well above** their head and off direct alignment.\n  - Preserves 2 safe moves next turn with **no forced collisions**.\n  - Moves us toward **open, rich territory on the right** where we can grow.\n  - Lets us use our existing x=4 spine as a **back wall** while we expand around it to eventually cage them.\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples right now. Forcing or allowing any clean head-on is basically signing the GG screen. So our move must:\n- Avoid giving them a forced trade,\n- Increase our future dominance,\n- Keep options wide open.\n\nRIGHT does exactly that. DOWN tempts their game plan.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Plan for future me (next few turns)\n\n- **Stay high**: from (3,5), favor staying around y5\u20137. Use altitude to hover over them while they\u2019re trapped low-left.\n- **Slide right**: look to step toward columns 5\u20137 soon, grabbing safe growth while our x=4 wall plus new segments start cutting the board in half.\n- **No early trades**: any time you see a square both heads could move into, *and* they\u2019re still ahead on apples, DO NOT take it. Let them be the one terrified of our length later.\n- **Long-term box**: as they work along bottom/left, aim to wrap from the right and above, turning our body into a cage. Once we\u2019re equal or ahead in apples, *then* we can consider using head-on threats aggressively.\n\nAlright chat, we stay icy, we stay lethal, we go where the control is \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nRIGHT",

Immediate self-chomp.  \n  \u274c Also out.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  Looks empty *this* turn\u2026 but look at the shape of our body:  \n  After moving to (3,6), we\u2019d be surrounded next turn by our own body on **all four sides**:\n  - (3,7), (2,6), (4,6), (3,5) are all our segments.  \n  That\u2019s a **hard self-lock**. Next turn we\u2019d have **zero legal moves** and be forced to die.  \n  \u274c Not acceptable.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,4)**  \n  Empty now, no body, no wall, no apple. Safe this turn \u2705  \n\nSo **only one move keeps us alive without walking into a guaranteed tomb**: **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Sanity check vs enemy moves\n\nEnemy from **(2,2)** can go:\n- **UP \u2192 (2,3)** (likely; lines them up to grab the apple at (1,3) next turn),\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,2)**.\n\nWhichever they do, **(3,4)** is not reachable by them this turn, so:\n- No head-on now,\n- No immediate crash into their body.\n\nYes, going **DOWN** pulls us a bit closer vertically, so we\u2019ll need to be careful next turn about squares like **(3,3)** and **(2,4)** that could become contested. But compared to:\n- UP = guaranteed self-death next turn,\n- LEFT/RIGHT = instant self-death,\n\nDOWN is the **only** line that actually keeps the game going and preserves future play.\n\nWe\u2019ll manage the head-on risk on the following turns by **avoiding any square they can also step into when they\u2019d win the trade**. We still have room to slip around through (2,4) / (3,3) and then arc back toward the right side of the board.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term plan for Future Me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- From **(3,4)**, prioritize moves that **don\u2019t share target squares** with their head:\n  - Be very wary of **(3,3)** and **(2,4)** if their head is one step away.\n- Try to **slide left/up** to stay above them rather than directly under/over their column, unless we can clearly avoid head-on.\n- Then rotate back **rightward** toward the open space and apple cluster on the right half of the board.\n- Long-term: use our **x=4 body wall** plus new growth to slowly partition the board, boxing them into the bottom-left. We only consider head-on fights **after** we\u2019ve closed the apple gap.\n\nWe stay alive, we stay mobile, we keep the grind going \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n---\n\n### Current situation\n\n- Our head: **(3,4)**  \n- Our neck (don\u2019t go there): **(3,5)**\n- Enemy head: **(3,2)**  \n- Score: **Us 11 vs Them 13** \u2192 if we trade heads right now and both die, **we lose**.\n\nEnemy\u2019s legal moves from (3,2) (no suicides, no backwards):\n- **UP \u2192 (3,3)**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,1)**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,2)**\n\nOur legal candidates from (3,4):\n- **UP \u2192 (3,5)** = backwards into neck \u2192 instant death \u2192 throw it out.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,4)**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)** (our current tail)\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,3)**\n\n---\n\n### Check each move\n\n#### 1) DOWN \u2192 (3,3)\n- That square is also reachable by the enemy going **UP from (3,2) to (3,3)**.\n- If we go DOWN and they go UP: **both heads land on (3,3)** \u2192 **Double KO**.\n- With scores **11 vs 13**, they win the game on the spot.\n- They have every incentive to choose UP if this is on the table.\n\nConclusion: **DOWN is suicidal against a rational opponent. Hard NO.**\n\n---\n\n#### 2) LEFT \u2192 (2,4)\n- (2,4) is currently empty (no body, no apple).\n- Enemy cannot reach (2,4) this turn (needs 3 moves).\n- Immediate safety: OK.\n\nBut look one turn ahead if enemy plays the aggressive **UP \u2192 (3,3)** (which is great for them vs our DOWN, so very plausible overall):\n\nAfter that:\n- Our head would be at **(2,4)**, neck at (3,4).\n- Enemy head at **(3,3)**.\n\nNext turn from (2,4), our non-suicidal options:\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)** = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- **UP \u2192 (2,5)** = runs into our own body (not tail) \u2192 death.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,3)** = free.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,4)** = free.\n\nEnemy from (3,3) can:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**  \n(Up is into our body, back is illegal.)\n\nContested square: **(2,3)**  \n- Our **DOWN** and their **LEFT** both land on (2,3) \u2192 head-on we lose.\n- So we\u2019d be forced to go **LEFT \u2192 (1,4)** only, drifting toward their wall on x=0 and getting cramped on the left side.\n\nConclusion: LEFT is *playable* but funnels us toward the enemy\u2019s territory and reduces flexibility.\n\n---\n\n#### 3) RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)  (our current tail)\nKey detail: moving into your **own tail** is allowed **if you\u2019re not growing**, because the tail vacates simultaneously and that cell becomes free.\n\n- (4,4) is our tail and has **no apple**, so we won\u2019t grow; the tail at (4,4) disappears as we move.\n- Enemy cannot reach (4,4) from (3,2) in one step.\n- No snake body will be on (4,4) after movement \u2192 safe.\n\nAssume again the aggressive enemy move **UP \u2192 (3,3)**:\n\nAfter this turn:\n- Our head: **(4,4)**  \n- Our next-step options (ignoring head-on for a second):\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (3,4)** = backwards \u2192 illegal.\n  - **UP \u2192 (4,5)** = our *new* tail; safe to step into next turn if we\u2019re not growing.\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (4,3)** = empty.\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)** = empty and opens the board.\n\nEnemy from (3,3):\n- Legal non-suicidal: **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)** or **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**.\n\nOnly contested square next turn is **(4,3)**:\n- Our **DOWN** and their **RIGHT** both could land there \u2192 head-on we\u2019d lose.\n- But we can simply choose **UP or RIGHT** instead, staying completely safe while sliding into open space to the right.\n\nSo with RIGHT:\n- We stay away from forced collisions.\n- We keep **multiple safe follow-up moves**.\n- We move toward the wide-open, apple-rich right side, while our thick body at x=2\u20134 starts to act like a wall between us and them.\n\nConclusion: **RIGHT is the best mix of safety, future options, and positional dominance.**\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan note for Future Me\n\n- Prioritize expanding **rightward and upward** from (4,4), using our existing body in columns 2\u20134 as a barrier to keep the enemy boxed toward the bottom-left.\n- Avoid any move that lands on a square the enemy head can also reach in one step while they\u2019re ahead on apples; no losing head-on trades.\n- Once we\u2019ve secured more of the right-side territory and farmed a few apples, we can start tightening the noose and look for chances where they are forced to run their head into our body or into a head-on where **we** are ahead.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards = instant death \ud83d\udeab  \n  \u279c **ELIMINATED**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,3)**  \n  Empty right now\u2026 but enemy can go:\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)** from (3,3)\n\n  If we go DOWN and they go RIGHT, **both heads land on (4,3)** \u2192 double KO \u2192 they win 13\u201311.  \n  They LOVE that trade, they snap-pick it every time.\n\n  \u279c DOWN is effectively **suicide vs a rational opponent** \u274c\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,5)**  \n  That\u2019s currently **our tail**. No apple there, so we **won\u2019t grow**, tail vacates, moving into it is **allowed** \u2705  \n  Enemy cannot reach (4,5) this turn from (3,3). No head-on possible this turn.  \n  \u279c **SAFE**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)**  \n  Empty, no body, no apple. Enemy can go to (2,3) or (4,3) \u2013 neither is (5,4). No collision this turn.  \n  \u279c **SAFE**\n\nSo **only real candidates:** **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare UP vs RIGHT\n\n#### Option A: UP \u2192 (4,5)\n\n- New head: (4,5)  \n- We\u2019re sitting on top of our own coil. Next turn our only legal moves are:\n  - **UP \u2192 (4,6)** (into our new tail, allowed)\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)** (empty)\n\nSo we\u2019ll have **2 safe options** next turn.\n\nEnemy responses this turn:\n\n- If they go **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)**:  \n  - Next turn they can go **LEFT \u2192 (1,3)** and grab an apple, bumping to **14 apples**, extending their lead.\n- If they go **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**:  \n  - They end up just under us, but next turn our moves (UP to 4,6 or RIGHT to 5,5) don\u2019t create any forced head-on. Still safe.\n\nConclusion: UP is **safe**, but:\n- It keeps us **tucked into our own mass**,  \n- Doesn\u2019t expand our territory,  \n- And lets them freely pivot toward more apples while we\u2019re still behind.\n\nNot terrible, but kinda passive \ud83d\ude12\n\n---\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)\n\n- New head: (5,4)  \n- Our next-turn neighbors:\n  - **UP \u2192 (5,5)** (empty)\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)** (empty)\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (5,3)** (empty)\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (4,4)** (our body, illegal)\n\nSo we\u2019ll have **3 good lanes** to work with next turn \u2013 way more flexibility \ud83d\ude0e\n\nEnemy this turn:\n\n1. **LEFT \u2192 (2,3)**  \n   - They drift further left, we claim center-right.  \n   - Next turn they can chase an apple at (1,3), but we\u2019re opening up the huge right side where a ton of apples live.\n   - No head-on risk next turn from any of our moves (5,5/6,4/5,3).\n\n2. **RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)**  \n   - They slide under us. Next turn:\n     - Our options: (5,5), (6,4), (5,3)\n     - Their options: (5,3) or (4,2) (UP into our body kills them)\n   - Only contested square is **(5,3)**.  \n     If we went **DOWN to (5,3)** and they went **RIGHT to (5,3)** \u2192 double KO \u2192 they win.\n   - But we just **don\u2019t choose DOWN** then; we still have **UP and RIGHT** to stay safe.\n\nSo **RIGHT**:\n- Avoids any forced collision this turn \u2705  \n- Gives us **more future options** \u2705  \n- Pushes us into the **wide-open, apple-rich right side** \u2705  \n- Starts building our body into a **wall between them (bottom-left) and the rest of the board**, setting up future box-ins \u2705  \n\nGiven they\u2019re ahead in score, we **must avoid trades** and instead:\n- Grab space,\n- Outscale them on apples later,\n- Then threaten head-on *after* we\u2019re the big boss snake.\n\nRIGHT does all of that better than UP.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Long-term note to Future Me\n\n- Keep snaking **right and slightly up**, using our thick body in the 2\u20134 columns as a **barrier**.\n- Avoid any move that lands on a square they can also reach next turn while they\u2019re ahead on apples \u2013 no losing double-KOs until we flip the scoreboard.\n- Once we secure the right side and start catching up on apples, look for moments where:\n  - Their only escapes run into our body, or\n  - They\u2019re forced into a head-on we **win** because we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nLet\u2019s take that center-right control and start boxing them in from above and the right, chat \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

They love that, we hate that.  \n\u2192 DOWN is effectively suicide vs a rational opponent. Eliminated.\n\n**UP \u2192 (5,5)**  \n- (5,5) is empty.  \n- It\u2019s not a tail square, just free space, so no weird interactions.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (5,5) this turn from (4,3) in one step, so no head-on risk this move.  \n\u2192 UP is safe this turn.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)**  \n- (6,4) is empty, not our body, not theirs.  \n- Enemy from (4,3) cannot reach (6,4) in one step, so no head-on this move.  \n\u2192 RIGHT is also safe this turn.\n\nSo we\u2019re down to **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare UP vs RIGHT\n\n#### UP \u2192 (5,5)\n\nIf we go UP:\n\n- New head: (5,5)  \n- After our move (no apple), tail (4,6) moves forward, so our body runs from (5,5) down and left into that big coil.\n\nNext turn from (5,5) we have:\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) (open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) is backwards into our own neck, illegal\n\nSo **3 safe options** next turn.\n\nEnemy likely responses this turn:\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)**:  \n  - They slide under us into the center lane.\n  - From there, next turn, they can go DOWN or RIGHT towards the juicy right/bottom apples.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,2)**:  \n  - They drift further down, still with access to the entire bottom and right sides across rows 1\u20133.\n\nStrategically: going UP keeps us a bit higher and lets them run freely along row 3 under us to the right-side apples. We end up \u201cfloating\u201d above them while they eat the lower-right candy. Safe, but it concedes a lot of central control.\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)\n\nIf we go RIGHT:\n\n- New head: (6,4)  \n- Our tail (4,6) moves up to (4,7), so we extend a **horizontal bar** through row 4.\n\nNext turn from (6,4):\n- UP \u2192 (6,5) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) (open, path toward apple at (8,4))\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3) (open but *contested*: from enemy at (5,3) they could go RIGHT to (6,3) \u2192 potential future head-on)\n\nEnemy likely this turn:\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)** (most natural: straight lane to (7,2), (9,3), etc.), or  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,2)** (falling back toward bottom).\n\nIf they go **RIGHT \u2192 (5,3)** while we go RIGHT \u2192 (6,4):\n\n- Positions: us (6,4), them (5,3).  \n- Next turn we can safely choose **UP** to (6,5) or **RIGHT** to (7,4), staying above/away from a head-on.\n- We just **don\u2019t** take DOWN to (6,3) if it would create a losing double-KO. We\u2019ll have at least two clean, safe moves.\n\nStrategically, RIGHT is much nicer:\n\n- We start forming a **ceiling** above their likely path along row 3.\n- We keep them mostly in the bottom-left and bottom-center while **we** step into the rich right-side.\n- From (6,4) we can very quickly pivot:\n  - UP then RIGHT to grab the apple at **(7,5)**,\n  - or chain RIGHTs to the apple at **(8,4)**.\n- We hold strong central-right control, which is exactly what we want to later box them in and then, once we\u2019re ahead, threaten a winning head-on.\n\nUP is safe but a bit evasive; RIGHT is safe *and* aggressively improves our board position and future trapping potential.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term note to Future Me\n\nKeep pushing into the **right side** while staying slightly **above** or level with their head. Aim to:\n\n- From (6,4), prioritize routes through (6,5) \u2192 (7,5) and/or (7,4) \u2192 (8,4) to snag quick apples and close the score gap.\n- Use our growing body across columns 3\u20136 as a **horizontal and vertical wall** that keeps them trapped mostly in the lower-left and lower-middle lanes.\n- Avoid any move that contests a single square with them while they\u2019re still ahead in apples; once we overtake their score, start looking for forced head-ons where they have no safe alternative but to run into our body or lose space.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards is illegal and instant death.  \n\u2192 LEFT is off the table.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (6,3)**  \n- Currently empty.  \n- But enemy from (5,3) can move:\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,2)  \n  - UP \u2192 (5,4) (into our body, suicide)  \n- If we go DOWN to (6,3) and they go RIGHT to (6,3) \u2192 both heads on same cell \u2192 double KO.  \n- On apples, they\u2019re ahead 13\u201311, so they win that. They are incentivized to take that collision.  \n\u2192 DOWN is effectively suicide against a rational opponent.\n\n**UP \u2192 (6,5)**  \n- (6,5) is empty.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move.  \n- No immediate collision risk; safe this turn.  \n- Future from (6,5): we\u2019ll have 3 legal directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) and great access to apples at (7,5), (8,5), etc.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7,4)**  \n- (7,4) is empty.  \n- Enemy cannot get to (7,4) this turn (they\u2019d need two steps).  \n- Safe this turn.  \n- Future from (7,4): we\u2019ll have UP (7,5, apple), RIGHT (8,4, apple), DOWN (7,3, contested but avoidable).\n\nSo legal candidates: **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) UP vs RIGHT \u2013 which dominates the board?\n\n#### If we go UP to (6,5):\n\nLikely enemy best response: **RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)**\n\nAfter that:\n- Our head: (6,5)  \n- Their head: (6,3)  \n- Our neck at (6,4) sits between us.\n\nNext turn we have from (6,5):  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5) (apple)  \n- UP \u2192 (6,6) (open)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5) (open)  \n\nThey from (6,3) have:  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2)  \n(UP hits our body, suicide; LEFT is back at neck.)\n\nSo UP is safe: we can eat apples and they run underneath.  \nBut note: when we later move from (6,5) to (7,5), the square (7,4) remains **empty**, not part of our wall. That means their path from below at x=7 isn\u2019t fully sealed\u2014harder to box them in tight later.\n\n#### If we go RIGHT to (7,4):\n\nLikely enemy best response: **RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)**\n\nAfter that:\n- Our head: (7,4)  \n- Their head: (6,3)  \n\nNext turn options for us from (7,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,5) (apple)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) (apple)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,3) (but that creates a possible double KO if they go RIGHT from 6,3 \u2192 we will simply *never* choose DOWN there while behind on score)\n\nIf on the next turn we go **UP to (7,5)** while they go **RIGHT to (7,3)**, we create:\n\n- Our head at (7,5)  \n- Our body at (7,4)  \n- Their head at (7,3), neck at (6,3)\n\nSo we\u2019ve built a **solid vertical pillar** at x=7:  \n- y=5: our head  \n- y=4: our body  \n- y=3: their head stuck underneath\n\nThey can\u2019t go UP (7,4 is our body), can\u2019t go LEFT (their neck), so they **must** go RIGHT or DOWN, staying trapped below our wall while we dominate the upper-right apples.\n\nThis is huge for long-term board control:  \n- We\u2019re above them.  \n- We\u2019re closer to the rich cluster of right-side apples (7,5), (8,5), (9,6), (7,8), (7,9), etc.  \n- We start constructing the kind of ceiling that can eventually box them into the lower-right or lower-left.\n\nUP gets us to the same apple zone, but RIGHT first gives us:\n- Equal immediate safety.\n- Better geometry to wall them off.\n- Stronger options to chain apples quickly (UP to 7,5, then RIGHT to 8,5, etc.) while they are forced to dodge beneath us.\n\nAnd as long as we **never** step DOWN from (7,4) while they can contest (7,3), there\u2019s no unwanted double KO.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan to future me\n\n- Take **RIGHT** now, then prioritise **UP to (7,5)** for the apple and the vertical wall over their head if they go rightward.\n- Stay slightly **above** and to the **right** of their head, using our existing left-side coil as a back wall and extending a horizontal/vertical cage across the middle.\n- Avoid any head-on collision until we\u2019ve overtaken their apple count; once we lead, start steering them into either:\n  - our body (they die alone), or  \n  - a forced head-on they can\u2019t escape where we\u2019re ahead on score.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backward is illegal, instant self-KO.  \n\u2192 LEFT is off the table.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7,3)**  \n- Currently empty.  \n- Enemy from (6,3) can move:\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,2)\n  - UP \u2192 (6,4) (into our body, suicide)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,3) (backwards, illegal)\n- If we go DOWN to (7,3) and they go RIGHT to (7,3) \u2192 head-on collision.  \n- With apples 13\u201311 in their favor, they happily take that trade and win the game.  \n\u2192 DOWN is effectively suicide vs any sane rival.\n\n**UP \u2192 (7,5)**  \n- There\u2019s an apple at (7,5), no snake body there.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (7,5) in one move from (6,3).  \n\u2192 UP is safe and gains us +1 apple.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)**  \n- There\u2019s an apple at (8,4), no snake body there.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (8,4) in one move from (6,3).  \n\u2192 RIGHT is also safe and gains us +1 apple.\n\nSo our real choices: **UP** or **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) UP vs RIGHT \u2013 who dominates the map?\n\n#### If we go UP to (7,5):\n\nBest enemy response is likely **RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)**, staying under us.\n\nAfter that:\n- Our head: (7,5)  \n- Our body at (7,4), plus a solid wall across y=4 from x=3\u20137  \n- Their head: (7,3)\n\nResult: we form a vertical pillar at x=7:\n- y=5: our head  \n- y=4: our body  \n- y=3: their head\n\nThey are trapped below that column:  \n- From (7,3) they **can\u2019t** go UP (our body), **can\u2019t** go LEFT (backwards), so they\u2019re forced RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nThat is good, BUT we leave the contested central apple at **(8,4)** still on the board. From below, they can later path:\n- 7,3 \u2192 8,3 \u2192 8,4 (apple)\nwhile we\u2019re busy eating 8,5 and moving higher. So UP first hands them a potentially free mid-board apple later.\n\n#### If we go RIGHT to (8,4):\n\nAgain, enemy\u2019s best likely response is **RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)**.\n\nAfter that:\n- Our head: (8,4) (we eat that apple)  \n- Our body now includes (8,4) and (7,4), still forming a strong wall across y=4 from x=3\u20138  \n- Their head: (7,3), trapped under our row-4 wall.\n\nCritically:\n- We **deny** them the contested apple at (8,4) forever.\n- Next turn we can go **UP \u2192 (8,5)** for another apple, keeping a tight vertical column **directly above** their likely lane at x=8.\n- The safe apple at (7,5) is basically unreachable for them as long as we own (7,4), so we can pick it up later without risk.\n\nFrom (8,4) next turn our safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8,5) (apple, enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) (open, no immediate contest)\nWe just avoid DOWN \u2192 (8,3), which could allow a head-on if they move RIGHT from (7,3). Easy to dodge.\n\nComparing:\n- Both UP and RIGHT this turn are safe and give us +1 apple (score 12\u201313).\n- **RIGHT** also removes a high-value, contested center apple from the enemy\u2019s future route and plants our body directly above them.\n- UP eats an apple they can\u2019t realistically ever touch anyway, while leaving the contested one alive for them.\n\nGiven we want to both grow and starve them of resources while keeping them boxed underneath our mid-board wall, **RIGHT** is the more ruthless, control-focused choice.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term note to future me\n\n- Take **RIGHT** now to grab (8,4) and extend our wall over their head.  \n- Next, favor **UP into (8,5)** for the chain of right-side apples (then towards 9,6, 7,8, 7,9).  \n- Keep them trapped in the lower rows (y\u22643) by maintaining a solid barrier at y=4\u20135 across the middle.  \n- Avoid all head-on collisions until we\u2019ve overtaken their apple count; once ahead, start steering them into either:\n  - our body (clean solo KO), or  \n  - a forced head-on they can\u2019t refuse when we\u2019re leading on apples.\n\nRIGHT",

We **cannot** take a head-on trade yet.  \n\nWe gotta box them in the basement and farm the penthouse \ud83c\udf4f\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head at (8,4):\n\n#### \ud83d\udd34 LEFT \u2192 (7,4)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck.\n- Moving backwards = instant self-KO.\n\u27a1\ufe0f **LEFT is illegal. Toss it.**\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe0 DOWN \u2192 (8,3)\n- Cell (8,3) is empty right now.\n- Enemy from (6,2) can go:\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) (apple)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,1)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,2)\n  - UP is backwards into (6,3), so **illegal**.\n- No immediate head-on this turn if we go DOWN.\n\nBut look at **next turn** if they go RIGHT to (7,2):\n- Our head: (8,3)\n- Their head: (7,2)\n\nOur neighbors from (8,3):\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,2)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,3, an apple)\n- UP \u2192 (8,4) is backwards (illegal)\n\nTheir neighbors from (7,2):\n- UP \u2192 (7,3)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1, an apple)\n\nShared future targets: **(7,3)** and **(8,2)**.  \nThey\u2019re ahead on apples, so if we ever step onto one of those while they also can, they\u2019ll happily take a double KO and win. We *can* dodge (e.g. go to 9,3), but going DOWN drags us into their half and into constant collision-threat territory. Why play in their arena when we\u2019re trailing? \ud83e\udd28\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f DOWN is *technically* survivable, but strategically bad and too cozy with the enemy while they\u2019re ahead.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe1 RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)\n- Cell (9,4) is empty.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (9,4) this turn from (6,2).\n- So RIGHT is immediately safe.\n\nBut:\n- We **don\u2019t** eat an apple \u2192 we stay at 12.\n- They likely go RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) and eat an apple \u2192 they go to 14.\n- That makes the gap **2 apples**, AND we drift toward the right wall with no food this turn.\n\nControl-wise:\n- Our horizontal wall on y=4 (x=3\u20138) is still strong, but we\u2019re less central and we\u2019re letting them outpace us in growth. Not ideal when we want to eventually bully them in head-on threats.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT is safe but passive and worsens the score gap. Meh.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe2 UP \u2192 (8,5)\n- Cell (8,5) has an apple.\n- Enemy from (6,2) **cannot** reach (8,5) in one move.\n- Immediate result if they go for the obvious apple at (7,2):\n  - Our head: (8,5), we go to **13 apples**.\n  - Their head: (7,2), they go to **14 apples**.\n  - Gap stays at **1 apple** instead of growing to 2.\n\nNext-turn safety check:\n- Our neighbors from (8,5):  \n  (8,6), (7,5), (9,5)  \u2014 (8,4) is backwards, illegal.\n- Their neighbors from (7,2):  \n  (7,3), (7,1), (8,2) \u2014 can\u2019t go back to (6,2).\n\nIntersection of those sets? **None.**  \nSo even next turn, there is **no possible head-on** square in a single move. We stay completely out of collision range while sitting in the juicy upper half of the board \ud83c\udf08\n\nBoard control:\n- We keep our thick wall along y=4 from x=3\u20138.\n- Moving UP to (8,5) puts us right in the corridor to:\n  - (7,5) apple\n  - (9,6) apple\n  - (7,8), (7,9), (5,8) apples\n- Meanwhile they\u2019re stuck farming the low stuff: (7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,0), (4,0)\u2026  \nWe dominate the **entire top belt** while staying well above them. That\u2019s exactly how we box them into the basement and grow into a monster \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **UP is safe, grabs an apple, keeps the gap from widening, and massively improves our strategic position.**\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan to future me \ud83c\udfaf\n\n- Priority: **Stay above row 4** for now. Keep that horizontal wall intact so they\u2019re trapped mostly in the bottom-left/mid rows.\n- From (8,5), chain the upper apples:\n  - Scoop (7,5) soon, then work toward (9,6), (7,8), (7,9), (5,8).\n- Avoid diving down into their neighborhood until we\u2019ve overtaken them in apples.\n- Once we\u2019re **ahead** on score, THEN start setting up corridors where any escape path gives them a forced head-on into us or into our body.\n- Always avoid giving them an easy double KO while they\u2019re ahead; they\u2019ll snap-take it.\n\nUP",

We basically own the **mid/top-center** of the map.\n\nEnemy head: **(8,1)**, crammed in the **bottom-left box** with their whole body coiled around there.\n\nScores:\n- **Us:** 14 \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **Them:** 15 \ud83c\udf4e  \nWe\u2019re down by 1, so a mutual head-on kill right now = **we lose**. No dumb trades yet. \ud83e\udde0\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Our Legal Moves from (9,6)\n\nCheck each:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,6)**: our own neck \u2192 **instant death** \u274c\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,6)**: off the board \u2192 **death** \u274c\n- **UP \u2192 (9,7)**: currently `.` \u2192 **safe**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,5)**: currently `.` \u2192 **safe**\n\nSo it\u2019s a **2-move decision**: UP vs DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd3a What Can the Enemy Do?\n\nEnemy head at **(8,1)**, neck at (8,2) so no back move.\n\nTheir options:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,1)** (apple)\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,0)** (empty)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,1)** (empty)\n\nNotice anything? None of these land anywhere near our options at (9,7) or (9,5).  \n\u27a1 **No possible head-on this turn**, whichever way we go. Good.\n\n---\n\n### Option 1: DOWN to (9,5) \ud83d\ude2c\n\nIf we go **DOWN**:\n\n- New head: **(9,5)** (safe this turn)\n- But then our follow-ups are super tight:\n  - **UP \u2192 (9,6)** = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (10,5)** = off board\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (8,5)** = our body \u2192 death\n  - **ONLY safe next turn: DOWN \u2192 (9,4)**\n\nSo by going **DOWN**, we are basically locking ourselves into:\n- This turn: (9,6) \u2192 (9,5)\n- Next turn: forced to (9,4)\n- Then likely **(9,3)** (apple) afterward to not die\n\nWe\u2019d be sliding down the **right wall** into the enemy\u2019s neighborhood, with almost no flexibility. Yeah, it helps build a vertical barrier at **x = 9**, and if we sit on **(9,4)** we close that right-side \u201cdoor\u201d for them\u2026\n\n\u2026but:\n- We enter a **narrow chute** with almost forced moves\n- We\u2019re walking into their sphere while **behind on score**\n- We risk creating awkward head-on scenarios around apples at **(9,3)** and **(9,2)** where a tie favors THEM\n\nThat\u2019s **high risk, low flexibility**. Aggression is good, but **suicidal corridors while losing**? Not it. \u274c\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: UP to (9,7) \ud83d\ude0e\n\nIf we go **UP**:\n\n- New head: **(9,7)** (empty, safe)\n- Snake shifts, tail at (2,7) disappears; we still keep our giant **y = 4 wall** intact.\n- Next turn from (9,7):\n  - **UP \u2192 (9,8)** (open, heading to lots of apples)\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (8,7)** (open)\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)** = backwards \u2192 illegal\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 off board**\n\nSo we have **2 safe options** next turn: UP or LEFT.\n\nStrategic upside? MASSIVE:\n\n- The entire **top band** (y = 7\u20139) is wide open:\n  - Apples at **(7,9), (5,8), (7,8)** just waiting for us \ud83e\udd24\n- We can grow in the **top-right / top-center**, building a **second horizontal wall** across the top from right to left.\n- Meanwhile, our **big y=4 wall** plus future top wall will start to **box the enemy into the bottom half**.\n- We stay FAR from immediate head-on risks while we\u2019re still down 1 point, but we\u2019ll be hoovering apples faster than them.\n\nThis is **safe**, **flexible**, and sets up our long-term **strangle play**. Exactly what we want.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Long-Term Plan to Future Me\n\n- **This turn:** Go **UP \u2192 (9,7)**.\n- Next few moves:\n  - Push **UP to (9,8)**, then either up to (9,9) and **LEFT across row 9**, grabbing:\n    - **(7,9)** apple\n    - Then swing down toward **(7,8), (5,8)** apples\n  - Use that to:\n    - Get **ahead on apples** so head-on trades become GOOD for us \ud83d\udc80\n    - Build a **top wall** so that, with our **mid wall at y=4**, we can later swing down left side and start **sealing off their escape at x=0\u20132**.\n- Do **NOT** dive down the right column into them until:\n  - We\u2019re **up on score**, OR\n  - We see a nearly forced line where they run straight into our body.\n\nGrow in the top, tighten the noose later. We\u2019re playing for the choke-out, not a coinflip.\n\nUP",

We own the **mid/top**. No immediate collision threats this turn, so this move is all about **position + future control**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Check All Four Moves\n\nFrom **(9,7)**:\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (9,8)**\n   - Board at (9,8): `.` (empty)\n   - Not our body, not enemy, in bounds \u2192 **SAFE \u2705**\n   - Next turn from (9,8): options **UP** or **LEFT** \u2192 still 2 safe moves.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (9,6)**\n   - That\u2019s our own neck segment.\n   - Moving directly backwards = **instant self-KO \u274c**\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (8,7)**\n   - Board at (8,7): `.` (empty)\n   - Not our body, not enemy, in bounds \u2192 **SAFE \u2705**\n   - Next turn from (8,7): options **UP** or **LEFT** (DOWN hits our body, RIGHT is backwards) \u2192 still 2 safe moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (10,7)**\n   - Off the 10x10 board \u2192 **DEATH \u274c**\n\nSo we only have **two real candidates**: **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd3a What Is The Enemy Doing?\n\nEnemy head: **(7,1)**, its neck is (8,1), so:\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,1)** = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal\n- **UP \u2192 (7,2)** = into their own body \u2192 death \u2192 they won\u2019t\n- Legal moves:  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (6,1)** (empty)  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (7,0)** (empty)\n\nEither way, they stay **down in the basement**. They are *nowhere near* our possible squares (8,7) or (9,8).  \nSo no head-on risk this turn at all.\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f UP vs LEFT \u2014 Which Actually Helps Us Win?\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so:\n- We **do not** want random coinflip collisions yet.\n- We **do** want:\n  - Fast, safe access to top apples\n  - A big body to dominate space and eventually **box them in**\n\nTop-area apples we care about:\n- **(7,9), (7,8), (5,8)**  \nPlus mid-ish: **(3,6), (7,5)** later.\n\n#### If we go **UP \u2192 (9,8)**\n\n- Keeps us hugging the **right wall**.\n- Next turn from (9,8): we\u2019re forced to choose **UP** or **LEFT**.\n- We can still pivot left afterward and sweep the top:\n  - Path to apples like (7,8), (7,9), (5,8) is clean but slightly more \u201cvertical first, then horizontal\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s safe, solid, but keeps us a bit more **stuck on the edge** for one extra move.\n\n#### If we go **LEFT \u2192 (8,7)**\n\n- We step **toward center** of the top half.\n- From (8,7) next turn:\n  - **UP \u2192 (8,8)** opens up three nice directions (UP, LEFT, DOWN) after that.\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (7,7)** positions us directly under the **(7,8)** and **(7,9)** apples.\n- This line quickly gives us access to:\n  - **(7,8)** and **(5,8)** and then **(7,9)**,\n  - While keeping a huge buffer between us and the enemy.\n\nStrategically, LEFT:\n- Keeps multiple future options open.\n- Moves us **closer to the main apple cluster** we want to monopolize.\n- Still stays miles away from any confrontation while we\u2019re behind on score.\n\nBoth are safe, but **LEFT** gives us slightly better **central control** and flexibility in the top band. Why play the edge when we can own the middle, right? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Long-Term Plan (Future Me, Don\u2019t Throw)\n\n- This turn: **go LEFT to (8,7)**.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Push **UP/LEFT** into the **(7,8), (5,8), (7,9)** apples to **catch up and pass** their score.\n  - Start building a **horizontal \u201cceiling\u201d** across the top rows (y=8\u20139).\n  - Keep distance from the bottom-right corridor for now; no diving down toward them until:\n    - We\u2019re **up on apples**, and  \n    - We can shape the board to force them into our body.\n- Once we\u2019re bigger & ahead:\n  - Use our mid-wall at **y=4** plus a new **top wall** to gradually **shrink their space** from the top and right.\n  - Aim to either:\n    - Starve them out of apples, or\n    - Force them into a desperate line that crashes into us \ud83d\udc80\n\nAlright chat, we play it smart, grow big in the top, then slam the cage shut later.\n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re stuck grinding bottom apples. No immediate collision danger.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Check ALL four moves from (8,7)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,8)**  \n  - Board at (8,8): `.` \u2192 **empty**\n  - Not our body, not enemy, in bounds \u2192 **SAFE \u2705**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,6)**  \n  - That\u2019s our body segment.  \n  - Head into own body = **INSTANT DEATH \u274c**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n  - Board at (7,7): `.` \u2192 **empty**\n  - Not our body, not enemy, in bounds \u2192 **SAFE \u2705**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our neck; moving backward is illegal and also our body \u2192 **DEATH \u274c**\n\nSo only **UP** and **LEFT** are legal.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy doing?\n\nEnemy head: **(7,0)**, neck at **(7,1)**.\n\n- **UP** = backwards into neck (illegal)\n- **DOWN** = off-board\n- Legal for them:\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (6,0)** (empty)\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (8,0)** (empty)\n\nThey\u2019re chilling at **y = 0**. We\u2019re at **y = 7**. There is **zero** chance of a head-on this turn or the next several. So this move is **pure positioning + farming**.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs LEFT \u2013 which is better?\n\nKey apples near us:\n- **Top band:** (7,8), (7,9), (5,8)\n- Mid-top: (3,6), (7,5) later\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so:\n- Priority: **safely grab top apples and get HUGE**, then box them in later.\n- Avoid dumb trades until we\u2019re **ahead**.\n\n#### Option A: UP \u2192 (8,8) \ud83e\udd14\n\nFrom new head **(8,8)**:\n- Neighbors (next turn):\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (7,8)** \ud83c\udf4e\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)** empty\n  - **UP \u2192 (8,9)** empty\n- That\u2019s **3 solid, safe options** and direct access to:\n  - (7,8) \ud83c\udf4e in 1 more move,\n  - (7,9) \ud83c\udf4e right after,\n  - Then we can slide left to (5,8) \ud83c\udf4e.\n\nWe also stay a bit **above** our own long horizontal wall on y=4 and the vertical stack on x=8, giving us clear air and low self-trap risk.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT \u2192 (7,7) \ud83e\udd14\n\nFrom new head **(7,7)**:\n- Neighbors:\n  - **UP \u2192 (7,8)** \ud83c\udf4e\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (6,7)** empty\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (7,6)** empty\n- Also **3 safe options**, same apple access timing.\n\nSo both moves are safe and strong. The tiebreaker?\n\n- **UP** puts us into the **wide-open top lane** with tons of escape routes.\n- It keeps us a bit more separated from our own dense body on the right/mid, reducing accidental box-ins.\n- We can then pivot LEFT into the apple line with maximum flexibility.\n\nGiven we\u2019re not under threat and we want **huge mobility up top**, **UP** is slightly better for long-term control.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Note to Future Me (Strategy)\n\n- Sweep the **top band**:\n  - Go UP now, then scoop **(7,8)**, **(7,9)**, then **(5,8)**.\n- Build a fat, safe body across **y=8\u20139**, keeping at least one clean route down the left/center so we don\u2019t self-trap.\n- While we\u2019re farming, watch how the enemy climbs out of the bottom pit; once we\u2019re **ahead on apples and size**, start steering toward them to threaten **forced head-ons** or traps using our big mid-wall at **y=4** + new top wall.\n\nTime to own the skies, chat \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

Our wall on **y=4** from x=3\u21928 plus the vertical at x=8 and x=9 basically **blocks the right-side passage to the top**. The only real highway left for them to reach the top? **Far left at x=0**.\n\nWe are safely far away from their head, so this turn is about **position + value**.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (8,8)\n\n**UP \u2192 (8,9)**  \n- In bounds? \u2705  \n- Tile: empty `.`  \n- Not our body, not theirs \u2192 **SAFE**\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (8,7)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body (neck).  \n- Backwards & collision \u2192 **INSTANT DEATH \u274c**\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- In bounds? \u2705  \n- Tile: **apple** \ud83c\udf4e  \n- Apples are good, not a body \u2192 **SAFE**\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n- In bounds? \u2705  \n- Tile: empty `.`  \n- Not a body \u2192 **SAFE**\n\nSo we have **3 legal moves**: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head: **(6,0)**, neck at (7,0).\n\nFrom (6,0):\n- UP \u2192 (6,1) empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0) **apple** \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,0) backward into neck \u274c\n\nThey\u2019re busy farming the **bottom apples**. No chance of any head-on with us in the next several moves. Our move is purely about **max value + long-term box**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate each safe move\n\n#### \u25b6 RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)\n\nFrom new head (9,8):\n- Next turn options:\n  - UP \u2192 (9,9) empty \u2705\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,8) (our neck, backward) \u274c\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,7) our body \u274c\n  - RIGHT \u2192 off-board \u274c\n\nSo if we go RIGHT, **next turn is basically forced UP**. Very tight. Not ideal for flexibility.\n\nVerdict: **Too constrained**, we ditch **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n#### \u25b6 UP \u2192 (8,9)\n\nFrom new head (8,9):\n- Neighbor options next turn:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,9) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,9) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (8,8) neck/backwards \u274c\n  - UP \u2192 off-board \u274c\n\nSo from UP we\u2019ll have **2 safe options** next turn and immediate access to **(7,9) apple** after.\n\nPros:\n- Keeps us in the **very top lane**.\n- Maintains our right-side blockade near the only right corridor (x=9), which is basically already locked by our body at (9,6),(9,7),(8,4\u20136).\n\nCons:\n- No apple **this** turn.\n- Slightly fewer future options than a more central tile.\n\n---\n\n#### \u25b6 LEFT \u2192 (7,8)\n\nFrom new head (7,8):\n- We **eat an apple immediately** \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 we go from 14 to **15**, shrinking the score gap to just **1** (while they likely go to 17 soon).\n- Next turn options from (7,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,9) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,8) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,7) empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) neck/backwards \u274c\n\nThat\u2019s **three** clean future moves, plus direct access to:\n- (7,9) apple above,\n- (5,8) apple to the left soon after.\n\nPositionally, (7,8) is **more central** on the top band. That makes it easier later to:\n- Sweep all the **top apples**,\n- Then rotate **leftward** to contest the only real escape corridor at **x=0**.\n\nSo between **UP** and **LEFT**:\n- Both are safe long-term.\n- **LEFT**:\n  - Gives an apple **right now** \u2705\n  - Gives **more future move options** (3 vs 2) \u2705\n  - Keeps us high and central for future rotations \u2705\n\nThat\u2019s strictly better by our own rules.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term game plan (memo to future me)\n\n- **Step 1: Farm top safely**\n  - Move **LEFT now to (7,8)** and grab that apple.\n  - Then likely go **UP** to **(7,9)** for another apple, then slide left toward **(5,8)**.\n  - Goal: get **bigger than them** so any future forced head-on is **in our favor**.\n\n- **Step 2: Maintain the right-side cage**\n  - Our existing wall at **y=4 (x=3\u20138)** and vertical stack near **x=8\u20139** already blocks the right passage.\n  - Keep that structure intact so they **cannot realistically climb up on the right** without walking into a death-trap pocket.\n\n- **Step 3: Rotate toward the left corridor**\n  - Once we\u2019re huge and top is mostly ours, begin drifting our head toward the **top-left**.\n  - Use our massive length to:\n    - Threaten to **cut off the x=0 vertical corridor**, or\n    - Push them into a **nasty squeeze** if they try to climb.\n\n- **Step 4: Look for lethal trades when ahead**\n  - When we\u2019re **up on apples**, be willing to steer into lines that threaten **head-on collisions** if they chase us.\n  - Bigger snake wins ties on simultaneous deaths at 30+ apples or endgame score; use that pressure.\n\nWe stay alive, we stay fat, and then we **strangle** them out of the map.  \n\nLEFT",

They\u2019re at **17 apples**, we\u2019re at **15** \u2014 we need to grow and set up the choke on the left corridor at **x=0**.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four directions\n\nFrom **(7,8)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,9)**  \n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Tile: apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Not our body, not theirs \u2192 **SAFE**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**  \n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Tile: empty `.`  \n  - Not our body, not theirs \u2192 **SAFE**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**  \n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Tile: empty `.`  \n  - Not our body, not theirs \u2192 **SAFE**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck segment.  \n  - Directly backwards into our body \u2192 **INSTANT DEATH \u274c**\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **3 safe moves**: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy up to?\n\nEnemy head: **(5,0)**. Their options:\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,1) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,0) apple \u2705  \n- Can\u2019t go DOWN (off board) \u274c  \n- Can\u2019t go RIGHT (back into neck) \u274c  \n\nWhatever they choose, they\u2019re **far** from us. No head-on risk this turn or the next few. This turn is all about **position + future control**.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate each safe move\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (7,7)\n\nNew head: (7,7), no apple, tail moves.\n\nNext-turn neighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) (our neck, backwards) \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) our body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) empty \u2705  \n\nOnly **2 safe options** next turn, and **no immediate apples** around. Also drifts us slightly away from the juicy top apples. This is the **weakest** option.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **DOWN: Pass.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (7,9) (apple)\n\nWe grab the apple immediately \u2192 go to **16 apples**.\n\nNext-turn neighbors from (7,9):\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) neck/backwards \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n\nSo **2 safe options** next turn. Solid, but it pushes us right up against the top wall and reduces flexibility. Also tends to funnel us toward the top-right, where we can get a bit cramped against our own vertical stack at x=8\u20139.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (6,8)\n\nNo apple this turn, tail moves (freeing (1,5)), but look at the follow-up:\n\nFrom new head **(6,8)**, next-turn neighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) **apple** \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) neck/backwards \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 safe options**, with a **guaranteed apple** at (5,8) in just **one more move** if we want it.\n\nPositionally:\n- We stay in the **top band**.\n- We become **more central** and closer to the **top-left** zone where the real choke point is (column **x=0**).\n- We *don\u2019t* hug the top wall yet, so we keep more room to maneuver and shape our future body as a net across the top.\n\nSo between **UP** and **LEFT**:\n- UP = apple now, but only 2 safe outs and pushes us tight to the ceiling.\n- LEFT = no apple this turn, but **better flexibility** and a clean line to **(5,8) apple** next, while drifting us toward the left-side choke we want to control.\n\nGiven how far the enemy is, we can afford to delay the apple by one move in exchange for **more control and better future options**.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **LEFT is strictly better for long-term domination.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Long-term plan (memo to future me)\n\n1. **Slide left along the top:**  \n   - Move **LEFT to (6,8)** now.  \n   - Strong candidate next turn: **LEFT to (5,8)** for the apple, then work toward the top-left quadrant.\n\n2. **Preserve the mid-right wall as long as possible:**  \n   - Our body on **y=4 (x=3\u20138)** and the vertical at **x=8\u20139** is still a big fence keeping them in the lower/mid-right.  \n   - As our tail shifts, be ready to reshape a new barrier if column 0 opens up behind their tail.\n\n3. **Contest the left corridor (x=0):**  \n   - Their only clean highway to the open top is that left column.  \n   - Grow big on the top side, then rotate toward **top-left** to threaten a massive wrap that can box them under us.\n\n4. **Avoid head-on trades until we\u2019re ahead:**  \n   - We\u2019re currently down **15\u201317**.  \n   - Priority: farm safe apples on the top; once we\u2019re **ahead in apples**, we can start steering into lines that threaten **favorable head-on collisions**.\n\nLet\u2019s keep squeezing the map, get bigger than them, then turn the whole top half of the board into our personal trap \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s cook.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Check all four directions from (6,8)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,9)**  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Currently empty.  \n  - Not our body, not theirs.  \n  - **SAFE.**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Currently empty.  \n  - Not our body, not theirs.  \n  - **SAFE.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - There\u2019s an apple there.  \n  - Not our body, not theirs.  \n  - **SAFE + GROWTH.**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck segment.  \n  - Directly backwards into ourselves.  \n  - **INSTANT DEATH \u2013 ILLEGAL.**\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **three live options**: **UP, DOWN, LEFT.**\n\n---\n\n## 2) Where\u2019s the enemy, can he touch us?\n\nEnemy head: **(4,0)**, body loops in the bottom rows.  \nOur head: **(6,8)**, way up in the top zone behind our y=4 wall.\n\nManhattan distance is massive (10+), and there\u2019s a solid strip of our body at **y=4, x=3\u20138** separating top and bottom. There is absolutely **no chance** of a head-on this turn or the next few. We can focus on position and growth, not collisions yet.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Evaluate each safe move\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (6,7)\n\nIf we go **DOWN**:\n\n- New head: **(6,7)** (no apple, tail moves).\n- Next-turn options from (6,7):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,7) empty.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) empty.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,6) empty.\n  - UP \u2192 (6,8) is our neck (backwards, illegal).\n\nSo **3 future options**, which is fine.  \nBut this nudges us slightly closer to our own wall at y=4 without actually gaining anything special \u2013 no immediate apple, no new strategic leverage. It doesn\u2019t help extend our control; just drifts us downward into thicker traffic.\n\nVerdict: **Playable but low value.**\n\n---\n\n### UP \u2192 (6,9)\n\nIf we go **UP**:\n\n- New head: **(6,9)** (no apple, tail moves).\n- Next-turn options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,9) empty.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) apple.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,8) neck (illegal).\n  - UP \u2192 off-board (illegal).\n\nSo **2 real options next turn**, one of which is a nice apple at (7,9).\n\nBiggest drawback: we glue ourselves to the **top wall** immediately. That reduces our flexibility to weave and shape our body for a future box. We\u2019re still safe, but we\u2019re voluntarily walking up to the ceiling early when we don\u2019t need to.\n\nVerdict: **Decent, but restricts our mobility a bit too soon.**\n\n---\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (5,8) (APPLE)\n\nIf we go **LEFT**:\n\n- New head: **(5,8)** on an apple \u2192 we **grow** (apples: 15 \u2192 16).  \n  - Tail at (2,5) does **not** move this turn (our mid-wall at y=4 stays solid).\n- Next-turn options from (5,8):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,8) empty.\n  - UP \u2192 (5,9) empty.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,7) empty.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,8) is our neck (illegal).\n\nThat gives us **3 excellent future options**, plus **immediate growth**, and we stay in a very open, high-mobility zone.\n\nStrategic upside:\n- We shift **toward the top-left**, exactly where we want to be to eventually own the left corridor (x=0\u20132).\n- We **maintain** our big blocking wall at y=4 because the tail doesn\u2019t move; that keeps the opponent boxed in the lower half longer.\n- We stay one row below the ceiling, so we can choose later whether to run the lid along y=9 or hover at y=8 as we sweep left.\n\nGiven we\u2019re **behind on apples (15 vs 18)**, grabbing a safe apple while preserving and expanding our control is ideal.\n\nVerdict: **Best combination of growth, safety, and future control.**\n\n---\n\n## 4) Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n1. **Sweep left along the top band:**  \n   - Use this move to go **LEFT to (5,8)**, then keep drifting left across y=8/9, eating apples and enlarging our \u201cceiling\u201d over the board.\n\n2. **Preserve the mid wall as long as possible:**  \n   - Our body at **y=4, x=3\u20138** is a brutal gate keeping the enemy stuck low.  \n   - Growing instead of shrinking that wall forces them to live under us while we farm the safe upper apples.\n\n3. **Build a lid and then a cage:**  \n   - Extend a wide body across the **top rows** and then down the **left side**, aiming to eventually bend under them from the left.  \n   - When we get **ahead in apples**, we can start actively steering into potential **head-on collisions** they can\u2019t afford.\n\n4. **Avoid unnecessary tight loops:**  \n   - As we push left, keep our turns wide so we never trap our own head in the top-left corner. Leave ourselves at least two escape lanes whenever possible.\n\nWe\u2019re going to get bigger, thicker, and then slam the door on them from above and the left.\n\nLEFT",

Our danger is 100% self-trap, not him.\n\nHe likely goes **UP to (3,1)** to grab the apple there, but whatever he does, it doesn\u2019t affect our immediate neighborhood.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare our safe moves\n\n#### UP \u2192 (5,9)\n- Pros:\n  - Safe.\n  - Path toward top apple at (7,9).\n- Cons:\n  - Glues us to the **top wall** immediately.\n  - Only **2 future options**, reduces flexibility.\n  - Doesn\u2019t move us toward the rich apple cluster around **(3,6), (6,6), (7,5)** as efficiently.\n\nNice but too claustrophobic for a long snake trying to control half the map.\n\n---\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (4,8)\n- Pros:\n  - Keeps **3 future options** (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n  - Shifts us toward the **left side**, which we eventually want to use to close the cage on him.\n  - Still not hugging the top.\n\n- Cons:\n  - Moves us **farther** from the super-valuable apple at **(6,6)** (distance 3 \u2192 4).\n  - Apple access is okay, but not optimal compared to going down.\n\nPositionally very nice for the box, but not the best balance of apples + flexibility right now.\n\n---\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (5,7)\n- Pros:\n  - **3 future options** (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) from an open central tile.\n  - Moves us **closer to multiple apples**:\n    - To (6,6): distance goes **3 \u2192 2**.\n    - To (3,6): distance goes **4 \u2192 3**.\n    - To (7,5): still very reachable.\n  - Keeps us off both the ceiling and our own y=4 body wall \u2013 we\u2019re in a big, breathable pocket.\n  - From (5,7) we can still swing **left** next turn if we want to start the cage.\n\n- Cons:\n  - Brings us *slightly* closer to our mid-wall, but we\u2019re still three rows above it with lots of horizontal space. No imminent self-box.\n\nGiven we\u2019re **down 16\u201319** on apples, getting closer to that mid-top apple cluster **while** keeping 3 outs is huge. DOWN threads the needle between aggression and safety better than UP or LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan (yo future me, read this \ud83d\ude0f)\n\n1. **Farm the mid-top apples safely**  \n   - From (5,7), drift toward **(6,6)**, **(3,6)**, and **(7,5)** to grow fast.  \n   - More length = more board control = more ways to choke him later.\n\n2. **Maintain the mid-wall at y=4 as a soft ceiling over him**  \n   - Try to keep that band **(3\u20138,4)** intact as long as possible.  \n   - He\u2019s stuck in the basement while we farm the penthouse.\n\n3. **Then migrate left to build the cage**  \n   - After we\u2019re chunkier and have eaten a few more apples, start shifting our route toward **x=0\u20132** on the top side.  \n   - Goal: eventually sweep down the **left side** and threaten to close off the gap around **x=0\u20132, y=4**.\n\n4. **No head-on suicide until we\u2019re ahead**  \n   - We\u2019re behind on apples, so **avoid dumb head-ons**.  \n   - Once we\u2019re up on score and bigger, we can start aiming for lethal collision lines he can\u2019t afford.\n\nAlright chat, we keep it flexible, get closer to value, and don\u2019t kiss the wall for no reason.\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re still the king of the penthouse, they\u2019re still renting the basement. Time to start BUILDING THE BOX \ud83d\udd12\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check every move from our head (5,7)\n\n**UP \u2192 (5,8)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck. Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udeab  \n- Illegal, we NEVER go backwards.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5,6)**  \n- On-board \u2705  \n- Cell is empty \u2705  \n- Future from (5,6):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,6) empty  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) apple \ud83d\ude0b  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,5) empty  \n- 3 good outs and easy access to the (6,6) apple. Very nice.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4,7)**  \n- On-board \u2705  \n- Cell is empty \u2705  \n- Future from (4,7):  \n  - UP \u2192 (4,8) empty  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,7) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,6) empty  \n  - RIGHT is back into neck (5,7), so not allowed  \n- Still **3 strong exits**. Super flexible.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n- On-board \u2705  \n- Cell is empty \u2705  \n- Future from (6,7):  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,6) apple  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) empty  \n  - UP and LEFT hit our body  \n- Only **2 outs**. Playable but tighter than LEFT/DOWN.\n\nSo **safe moves**: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**. UP is griefing.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy doing?\n\nEnemy head: **(3,1)**. Check their options:\n\n- UP \u2192 (3,2): their own body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,0): backwards \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1): their own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1): **apple and empty** \u2705\n\nThey are **forced** to go **RIGHT to (4,1)** and eat that apple.  \nNo way they touch us this turn; no head-on risk at all. Their whole drama is still below y=3.\n\nSo our danger this turn is ONLY self-positioning, not collisions.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT \u2013 which dominates the board?\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n- Drags us toward the right wall.  \n- Only 2 follow-ups, less freedom.  \n- Also walks us AWAY from the critical left-side escape lane we want to shut.  \n- Meh. Feels like playing scared, not ruthless.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5,6)**  \n- Super solid: 3 outs and direct access to (6,6).  \n- Good for farming apples and getting chunkier fast.  \n- BUT it keeps our head more central/right while our **tail slowly eats away our horizontal wall at y=4** from the left.  \n- If we don\u2019t shift left soon, the enemy can eventually slip out through a gap around **x=3,y=4** once that wall decays. Do we really want to give them that jailbreak opportunity? \ud83e\udd28\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4,7)**  \n- 3 great follow-ups (UP/LEFT/DOWN).  \n- Moves us **toward the left-side escape corridor** (columns 0\u20132) that the enemy could someday use.  \n- As we slide left, we can:\n  - Grab apples at **(2,7)** and **(0,7)** to grow, AND  \n  - Set up a future drop down the **left edge** to *rebuild* and *extend* the wall that boxes them in.\n\nRight now we have that beautiful band at **y=4 from x=3\u20138**. Our tail will eventually chew off the leftmost pieces if we don\u2019t refresh it with new body from the head route. Going LEFT now starts repositioning our head to the **top-left**, so later we can swoop **down around x=1\u20132** and **seal the cage** before they ever get near it.\n\nWhy let them breathe when we can suffocate them later, right chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nBetween **DOWN** (better short-term apple access) and **LEFT** (better long-term choke potential + still near apples), I\u2019d rather commit to the **containment win condition** now. Apples on the left (0,7 and 2,7) will feed us while we build that trap anyway.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (strategy for next few turns) \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- Push **further left** from (4,7): likely path through **(3,7) \u2192 (2,7)** to snag that apple and grow while drifting toward the left edge.  \n- After we\u2019re anchored around **x=1\u20132, y\u22487**, start eyeing a controlled **drop down the left side** toward **y=4**, aiming to reconnect with or rebuild a horizontal wall that keeps enemy locked in the basement.  \n- Keep our loops wide and avoid closing a tight pocket we can\u2019t escape; always leave at least 2 safe future moves for the head.  \n- Only think about head-on aggression against them once we\u2019ve **closed the cage** or caught up significantly on apples.\n\nWe play the long game, we own the map, and then we make them panic into a wall.

          "rationale": "We\u2019re BACK chat \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d Turn 50, big picture time.\n\nWe\u2019re at **(4,7)**, lounging up top. Enemy head is **(4,1)**, still stuck in the basement under our beautiful **y=4 wall** from **x=3 \u2192 8**. That wall is EVERYTHING right now \u2014 it\u2019s what keeps them penned in.\n\nOur body:\n- Horizontal wall: **(3\u20138, 4)**\n- Then up the right, then across the top center.\nTheir whole snake lives at **y = 0\u20133**. Only ways out are:\n- **Left gap** above columns **0\u20132**\n- **Right gap** near **x=9**\n- Or any gap we create in our own wall (like at **(3,4)**) if we misplay.\n\nWe want to **grow** AND **keep them caged** until we\u2019re big enough to choke them out or line up a winning collision. We\u2019re behind on apples (16 vs 21), so no reckless head-ons yet.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate our moves from (4,7)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,8)**  \n  - Cell: **apple**, no body there \u2705  \n  - Eating means **we grow**, and **our tail at (3,4) does NOT move**, so the wall from **(3\u20138,4)** stays solid this turn.  \n  - Next turn from (4,8):  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (3,8) empty  \n    - UP \u2192 (4,9) empty  \n    - 2 solid outs, with tons of open air on the left side.  \n  - Maintains the cage AND makes us longer. That\u2019s board dominance, not greed.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  - Cell empty \u2705  \n  - No apple, so tail shifts from **(3,4) \u2192 (4,4)**.  \n  - That means **we instantly open a gap at (3,4)**.  \n  - Above (3,4) is a clean vertical corridor: (3,5) '.', (3,6) 'A', (3,7) '.', (3,8) '.', etc.  \n  - If they ever snake their way to (3,4), they\u2019re FREE. Do we really want to hand them the keys to the cage right now? \ud83e\udd28\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  - Cell empty \u2705  \n  - Also no apple, so same problem: tail moves to **(4,4)**, **opening (3,4)**.  \n  - From new head (3,7) we\u2019d have:  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (3,6) apple  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (2,7) apple  \n    - UP \u2192 (3,8) empty  \n  - Super juicy locally (two apples next turn), BUT we\u2019ve already blown a hole right where our wall is closest to them. Once **(3,4)** opens, if they start drifting upward, they can eventually climb straight into the upper board through that pipe.\n\nSo both **DOWN** and **LEFT** this turn **immediately break our main horizontal cage** at (3,4). **UP** is the only move that keeps the wall fully intact right now.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head: **(4,1)**. Their options:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,2)** (apple) \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,1)** (empty) \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,1)** is backward into neck \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,0)** is into their own body \u274c  \n\nSo they\u2019re stuck choosing between **UP (to apple)** or **RIGHT**. Either way they\u2019re staying in the **low rows**, nowhere near breaking through our ceiling **this turn**.\n\nBut if we open **(3,4)** now, that\u2019s a future target. They can slowly slither up under us while their tail vacates space, and one bad timing from us and BOOM \u2014 they\u2019re in our half of the map. We do NOT want that while they\u2019re ahead on score.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Why UP is the play\n\nAsk yourself, chat: are we trying to race into a 50/50 scramble, or are we trying to **suffocate** this guy? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n**UP \u2192 (4,8)** gives us:\n\n1. **Growth**  \n   - Apples = length = **more body to wall them in**.  \n   - We go from 16 to 17 apples, getting closer to them while increasing our physical footprint.\n\n2. **Wall integrity (for at least one more turn)**  \n   - Tail stays at **(3,4)**, so the horizontal wall at **y=4, x=3\u20138** is still solid.  \n   - No instant escape hatch. They remain boxed under our \u201cceiling\u201d, forced to play in the basement.\n\n3. **Future mobility**  \n   - From (4,8) we have clean, low-risk routes:\n     - **LEFT to (3,8)** into wide open top-left space.\n     - **UP to (4,9)** then sweeping left or right along the top.\n   - Top-left is basically empty real estate we can colonize and later use to **drop a curtain down the left side** and fully lock them out of the upper board.\n\nChoosing **LEFT or DOWN now** trades long-term positional domination for short-term apple tempo, and it does so by **opening exactly the square that connects their prison to the rest of the map**. That\u2019s bad game sense when we\u2019re behind on score and already own the high ground.\n\nWe stay ruthless by:\n- Keeping them caged.\n- Growing where they can\u2019t contest us.\n- Only letting them see the sky when we\u2019re ready to crush them against it.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Game plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- After going **UP to (4,8)**:\n  - Favor drifting **leftward** (e.g., through (3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (0,7)) to claim the entire **top-left quadrant**.\n  - Use that position to plan a **controlled descent** down the left side (x=1\u20132) to build a new vertical wall that, combined with our horizontal at y=4 (or its successor), keeps the enemy totally sealed in the bottom-left.\n- Always track when our tail is about to vacate key wall squares; if we\u2019re about to create a gap that lines up with an enemy approach path, either:\n  - Re-occupy that file quickly with the head, or\n  - Have an alternate barrier (like a left-edge column) already in place.\n- Do NOT take head-on collision lines until:\n  - We\u2019re at least equal or ahead on apples, **and**\n  - We can force them into a no-escape corridor where the head-on favors us or draws when we\u2019re winning on board.\n\nWe win this by being the jailor, not by flipping a coin in the hallway.\n\nUP",

First, check all four moves:\n\n1. **DOWN \u2192 (4,7)**  \n   - That\u2019s our own neck segment. Moving directly backward is instant death.  \n   - DOWN is illegal.\n\n2. **RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)**  \n   - That\u2019s also our own body (not the tail). Running into it is a self-KO.  \n   - RIGHT is illegal.\n\n3. **UP \u2192 (4,9)**  \n   - On board: `.` (empty), inside the 10\u00d710 grid.  \n   - No way the enemy head reaches that square this turn.  \n   - Safe this turn.  \n   - But no apple there, so our tail at **(3,4)** will move to **(4,4)**, opening a permanent gap at **(3,4)** above the enemy\u2019s zone.\n\n4. **LEFT \u2192 (3,8)**  \n   - On board: `.` (empty), well inside the board.  \n   - Enemy is far away; no possible head-on.  \n   - Also no apple, so tail still moves from **(3,4)** to **(4,4)**, opening that same gap at **(3,4)**.  \n   - From (3,8) next turn we\u2019ll have three clean outs: UP (3,9), LEFT (2,8), DOWN (3,7), all empty.\n\nKey point:  \nThere is **no apple** on either UP or LEFT, so **our tail is moving this turn no matter what**. The horizontal wall at **y=4** loses the **(3,4)** segment either way. We cannot preserve the perfect ceiling this turn.\n\nSo what matters now?\n\n- **Both UP and LEFT open the (3,4) gap.**\n- **UP** leaves us at (4,9) with only two non-backward moves next: LEFT and RIGHT.\n- **LEFT** puts us at (3,8) with **three** non-backward moves (UP, LEFT, DOWN) and much better access to the wide-open **top-left quadrant** (huge for future wrapping and boxing).\n\nGiven the gap is inevitable, we should maximize **future mobility** and start **owning the left side** to eventually drop a vertical wall down and re-prison the enemy from above and the side.\n\n---\n\nStrategy note to future me:\n- From **(3,8)**, prioritize sweeping into the **top-left** (through (2,8), (1,8), etc.), then consider a controlled descent along the left columns to rebuild a multi-layer cage above and around the enemy. Keep avoiding head-on lines until we\u2019ve narrowed the score gap or set up a forced winning collision corridor.\n\nLEFT",

We just need a move that:\n\n- Keeps a ton of safe follow-ups open.\n- Stays well away from our own tight turns.\n- Does **not** risk some freak interaction with their head (which is extremely far away anyway).\n\nComparing our three legal moves:\n\n- **DOWN (3,7)**: safe and leads into a juicy apple cluster, but pulls us closer to our own mid-body and into a more tactically busy center. Still fine, but more complexity than we need while the opponent is auto-dying.\n- **UP (3,9)**: totally safe, but only two non-backwards options next turn and we hug the top edge. Not bad, just slightly less flexible.\n- **LEFT (2,8)**:  \n  - Maximum mobility (3 outs next turn).  \n  - Opens the whole **top-left** for us.  \n  - Far from enemy\u2019s doomed pocket and from the densest part of our own body.  \n\nWith the opponent already doomed, we prioritize **simplicity + safety + flexibility**. That screams:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **LEFT to (2,8)**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me\n\nEnemy is in a forced self-trap and will crash in a couple turns. Our only focus: keep tons of space open and avoid any tight self-wrapping. Continue drifting through the top-left quadrant, using the huge empty area to stay loosely coiled and far from our lower wall while their snake implodes. No hero plays needed\u2014just chill, stay wide, and collect apples only when they\u2019re on safe, open lines.\n\nLEFT",

Priority: do not die or create any convoluted tunnels near our own body for the next 2\u20133 moves. Stay in the top-left quadrant (rows 7\u20139, columns 0\u20133), using moves like LEFT/UP/DOWN to keep three or more options open. Only start pushing down toward the middle or eating more apples once the enemy is confirmed dead; until then, play wide and simple and avoid any path that could possibly self-box us or cause a same-turn death.\n\nLEFT",

Current situation\n\n- Our head: **(1,8)**\n- Our neck: **(2,8)** \u2192 so **RIGHT is backward = instant death.**\n- Enemy head: **(6,1)**, completely wrapped in its own body.\n\nLook at enemy\u2019s options from (6,1):\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,2) = their body  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,0) = their body  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,1) = their body  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,1) = their body  \n\nNo apples adjacent, no tail adjacent, no escape.  \nWhatever they do this turn, they slam into their own body and **die this turn**.\n\nSo the win condition is simple:  \n**Do not die this turn.**  \nIf we live and they die, we instantly win as the last snake alive, regardless of apples.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Check our possible moves\n\nFrom **(1,8)**:\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s our neck. Directly backward.  \n  - Illegal, suicide.  \n  - \u274c Reject.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,9)**  \n  - In bounds, currently empty.  \n  - No apple. Tail will move off (6,4), shortening our footprint a bit.  \n  - Next turn from (1,9):  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (0,9) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (2,9) empty  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (1,8) backward (illegal)  \n  - So we get **2 safe outs** next turn, and we stay on the very top edge.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,8)**  \n  - In bounds, empty.  \n  - No apple; tail moves off (6,4).  \n  - Next turn from (0,8):  \n    - UP \u2192 (0,9) empty  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (0,7) which is an apple  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) backward (illegal)  \n  - **2 safe outs**, and one of them leads directly to an apple.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,7)**  \n  - In bounds, currently empty.  \n  - No apple on (1,7); again tail moves off (6,4).  \n  - Next turn from (1,7):  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (0,7) apple  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) apple  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (1,6) empty  \n    - UP \u2192 (1,8) backward (illegal)  \n  - That\u2019s **3 safe outs**, with **two immediate apples** in reach.\n\nNo move puts us near the enemy; they\u2019re stuck deep at y=1 and dying no matter what. There\u2019s **zero risk** of a head-on this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Strategic choice\n\nWe only lose if:\n- We kill ourselves this turn (running into body / wall), and  \n- They also die this turn (which they will), making it a double KO decided on apples (we\u2019d lose 17 vs 22).\n\nSo our priorities:\n1. **Absolute safety this turn.**\n2. Among safe moves, maximize future flexibility + apple access once the enemy is gone.\n\nComparing safe options:\n\n- **UP (1,9)** \u2192 safe, but only 2 future directions, no immediate apple pressure.\n- **LEFT (0,8)** \u2192 safe, 2 future directions, one easy apple at (0,7).\n- **DOWN (1,7)** \u2192 safe, **3 future directions** (0,7 apple, 2,7 apple, 1,6 open), keeps us near a rich apple cluster in the upper-middle without getting near our own body.\n\nDOWN gives us the most freedom on the very next turn and positions us to start scooping apples in a wide, open corridor once the enemy\u2019s corpse is off the board.\n\n---\n\n### Short-term plan for future me\n\n- Enemy is guaranteed to die this turn; just stay alive.\n- After moving **DOWN to (1,7)**:\n  - Look to grab **(0,7)** and/or **(2,7)** apples while keeping an escape lane through **(1,6)**.\n  - Avoid diving too deep into the dense lower half (where the enemy coil is/was) until we\u2019ve controlled the top and upper-middle rows.\n  - Focus on smooth, wide loops rather than tight tunnels; with no enemy, our only remaining loss condition is self-trap.\n\nDOWN",
