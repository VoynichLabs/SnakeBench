Their head at (8,6) cannot jump up into row 9 this turn.\n- DOWN would put me into a tight corridor with fewer safe exits next turn (left/right are blocked by bodies), increasing risk of getting trapped.\n- RIGHT keeps options open (can continue right to collect the row-9 apples, then reassess), and gives the highest immediate reward (clear path to multiple nearby apples) with no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue RIGHT to collect the (5,9),(6,9),(7,9) cluster. After securing that cluster, head back down and navigate toward the lower apples (5,2) or (9,5) while avoiding the enemy’s row-8 blockade and not getting boxed in by my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

Even though that’s okay tactically, it unnecessarily restricts options on the next turn.\n- LEFT → (7,6) moves us away from the nearest apple at (9,5) and doesn’t gain us any strategic advantage right now; the enemy is nowhere near the lower-right, so we should claim that apple quickly.\n- DOWN → (8,5) is safe and keeps three follow-ups (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) open next turn. From (8,5) we can grab the (9,5) apple in one more move while maintaining maximum flexibility (from (9,5) with neck at (8,5), we can still go UP, LEFT, or DOWN).\n\nThe enemy at (3,9) can only move to (3,8) or (4,9) this turn, so they cannot contest (9,5) in time, and they are clearly better positioned for the top-row apple cluster; racing them there is both slow and unwinnable.

LEFT is explicitly illegal; UP and RIGHT go off-board. DOWN is the only move that is not illegal by the \"cannot move backwards\" rule (but does move into an occupied cell and thus is fatal). Because there is no safe legal move available, I will choose the non-backwards direction DOWN as the move.\n\nShort plan (if somehow I survive this turn): move back into the board and head toward the cluster of apples around x≈7 and x≈3 while avoiding row 8 where enemy bodies concentrate; keep routes open by staying in middle columns.\n\nDOWN",
