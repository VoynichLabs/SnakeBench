UP to (3, 6):\n   - Safe move, no collision with walls, my body, or enemy snake\n   - Continues toward the apple at (3, 8)\n   - Provides a path where I could potentially move toward (5, 6) later\n\n2. DOWN to (3, 4):\n   - This would collide with my body\n   - Invalid and fatal move\n\n3. LEFT to (2, 5):\n   - Safe move, no collision\n   - Could eventually lead toward apples at (0, 7)\n   - Takes me slightly away from the closest apple at (3, 8)\n\n4. RIGHT to (4, 5):\n   - Safe move, no collision\n   - Opens a path toward apples at (5, 6), (5, 3), and (5, 2)\n   - Provides more flexibility in movement options\n\nConsidering my options, RIGHT is very attractive as it:\n1. Opens paths to multiple apples (at (5, 6), (5, 3), and (5, 2))\n2. Gives me flexibility in my next moves\n3. Doesn't commit me to a single path\n\nGoing UP continues toward (3, 8) but is a more linear path, while RIGHT gives me access to more apples and movement options. Given the enemy snake is far away on the left side, I have room to maneuver on the right.\n\nFor my next turn strategy: After moving RIGHT to (4, 5), I'll likely move UP toward (4, 6) and then toward the apple at (5, 6), but will reassess based on the board state.\n\nRIGHT"

The enemy snake is to my left, so I need to be careful not to get cut off.\n\nGiven my options, I'll move RIGHT to (4, 8) which gives me space to maneuver and doesn't trap me against the upper wall yet. From there, I can potentially make my way toward either the apple at (9, 9) or plan a route to the southern apples.\n\nFor my next turn, I should consider continuing to move right and possibly up to eventually reach the apple at (9, 9), or start planning a safe path down to the cluster of apples in the lower part of the board.\n\nRIGHT"

UP to (6, 9):\n   - This is a safe move with no collisions\n   - Moves me one step closer to the apple at (9, 9)\n   - Creates a path where I can continue RIGHT toward that apple\n\n2. DOWN to (6, 7):\n   - This is a safe move with no collisions\n   - Moves me away from the apple at (9, 9)\n   - But could eventually lead to other apples in the lower part of the board\n\n3. LEFT to (5, 8):\n   - This would collide with my own body at (5, 8)\n   - Invalid and fatal move\n\n4. RIGHT to (7, 8):\n   - This is a safe move with no collisions\n   - Continues my path toward the apple at (9, 9)\n   - Maintains flexibility in my movement options\n\nLooking at the board, I have three viable options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\nThe UP move would put me at (6, 9), positioning me one row below the top of the board. From there, I could continue moving RIGHT to approach the apple at (9, 9).\n\nThe RIGHT move would put me at (7, 8), still allowing me to approach the apple at (9, 9) without getting too close to the top edge just yet.\n\nThe DOWN move would take me away from the closest apple at (9, 9), but might be a strategic option if I want to create more space for movement.\n\nConsidering that the enemy snake is currently at (4, 9) and could potentially move right toward the top-right apple, I should try to reach that apple first. The most direct path would be to move UP and then RIGHT multiple times.\n\nI'll move UP this turn to get closer to the apple at (9, 9). This gives me a straight path to continue right toward that apple. My next turn strategy should be to continue moving RIGHT until I reach column 9, then UP to get the apple.\n\nUP"
