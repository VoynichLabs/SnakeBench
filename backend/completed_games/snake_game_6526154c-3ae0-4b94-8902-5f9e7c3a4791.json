However, the last move information indicates the previous position was (7, 1), which suggests a misalignment or possibly that the initial coordinate reference for the snake's head was (4,1). Given the recent move was LEFT, and the head is now at (4,1), it makes sense that the snake moved from (5,1) to (4,1). \n\n- The closest apple is at (5, 2), which is directly above our current head at (4,1). Moving UP from (4,1) would bring us directly onto the apple at (5,2).\n\n- The position at (4,1) seems safe because:\n  - No other snake occupies that space.\n  - No immediate obstacle or wall adjacent in that direction.\n  - Moving upward toward the apple is efficient.\n\n- Moving left or right away would take us away from the apple or into less optimal positions.\n\n- Moving down from (4,1) would be outside the board if we consider y=0 as bottom, which is safe but less efficient because it doesn't lead to the apple.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving UP seems to be the best move to reach the apple at (5, 2) efficiently, with minimal risk.\n\nPotential risks:\n- Moving UP from (4,1) to (4,2): check if (4,2) is occupied or dangerous.\n- Looking at the board, (4,2) is free (not occupied by other snakes or apples at the moment).\n\nThus, the best move is to go UP to reach the apple at (5, 2). \n\nNext turn, I plan:\n- After reaching (4,2), move right to (5,2), which has an apple, and then plan subsequent steps accordingly to maximize points.\n\n**Next move: UP**",
