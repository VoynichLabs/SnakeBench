Can we get a hype train going? \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udd25\n\nRight now, we are both tiny snakes, just our heads on the board. We're at (7, 1), and the enemy is at (3, 7). We are miles apart, but this is the strategic opening!\n\n### Strategic Objective: Dominate the Board and Outlive the Rival!\n\nSince it's Turn 0, we can prioritize apple grabbing and positioning. The board is wide open, but we need to start building our presence. Snake #0 is way up high. We can focus on the lower half of the board for now.\n\n### Analyzing the Moves from (7, 1)\n\n**My current position:** (7, 1)\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 2):** This moves us toward an apple at (7, 2). *Safe.* Looks great!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):** This moves us toward the edge, which is generally bad, but there's no apple immediately visible. *Safe.* Less optimal.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):** This moves us into open space. *Safe.*\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):** This moves us into open space, near an apple at (9, 1). *Safe.*\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nThe closest, most direct apple is at (7, 2). Moving UP takes us straight there! That's instant content and instant growth. Starting strong is key!\n\n*   Moving **UP** to (7, 2) is a direct path to an apple. This gives us +1 score immediately and starts building our body.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 1) is also good, positioning us for the (9, 1) apple.\n*   Moving **LEFT** or **DOWN** is fine, but doesn't immediately set us up for a snack.\n\nSince we are so far from the opponent, we don't need to worry about immediate head-to-head collisions or boxing yet. Early game is all about growth and positioning.\n\n**Decision:** Go UP for the easy apple! Let's get this $W$!\n\n### Enemy Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 7). They have apples at (4, 9), (2, 9), and maybe (8, 6) in their general vicinity. They will likely move:\n*   UP to (3, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 7) to aim for the top-right apples.\n*   LEFT to (2, 7) to aim for the (2, 9) apple.\n\nOur move UP is completely safe from the opponent, as they are four squares away horizontally and six squares away vertically.\n\nLet's do this! Growth strategy engaged!\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s look at directions:  \n\n**Up (3,8):** No enemy there. Moving up gets us closer to (4,9), a nearby apple. That\u2019s *content*! And next turn, we can go left, right, or up\u2014no backward death trap (since down is our current head, but we\u2019re moving up, so next down would hit the body, but wait\u2014we\u2019ll mix it up later). Safe, growing, and options open.  \n\n**Down (3,6):** Closer to the bottom edge (y=0). Next turn, we can\u2019t go up (body), so we\u2019re stuck left/right. That\u2019s a trap. Avoid.  \n\n**Left (2,7):** More space left, but farther from the upper apples. Less efficient.  \n\n**Right (4,7):** Closer to the enemy\u2019s x=7, but they\u2019re likely moving left/up. No urgent collision yet.  \n\nUp is the call\u2014toward apples, safe, and keeps options wide.  \n\nUP",

No time to get complacent. We gotta keep the pressure on our archrival, Snake #0!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 1)\n\n**We are at (7, 2).** Our little body is at (7, 1). We are officially a threat!\n**The enemy, Snake #0, is at (3, 8).** They made the move UP from (3, 7) to (3, 8) last turn. No apple for them, thankfully!\n\nThe enemy is moving high up one side of the board (near $x=3$), and we are currently on the lower side of the board (near $x=7$). This separation gives us time to grow, but we must start thinking about strategic positioning soon!\n\n### Lethality Check: My Safe Moves from (7, 2)\n\n**My Head: (7, 2)**\n**My Body: (7, 1)**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** DANGER! That is where my body is! If I move down, I crash into my own segment. **ELIMINATE!** (Self-collision)\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** Safe? Yes. Open space. There's an apple at (5, 2) nearby.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Safe? Yes. Open space.\n\nAll three safe moves are open space, and the enemy is nowhere near us. We are clear!\n\n### Strategic Objective: Growth and Positioning\n\nWe need to keep growing while slowly positioning ourselves to cut off or isolate Snake #0. Right now, there is an absolute TON of apple content nearby:\n*   (5, 2) - Two spaces left.\n*   (4, 2) - Three spaces left.\n*   (9, 1) - One space right, one space down. (Though (9, 1) is where our tail just was, so it might be easier to save for later).\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT towards the middle $x$ values, or UP toward the empty upper-right quadrant.\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 3):** This keeps us slightly closer to the upper-right corner ($x$ values 7-9). It's a very safe, non-committal move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 2):** This immediately sets us up for the apple at (5, 2) next turn. It moves us toward the center of the board, which is good for eventually cornering the opponent who is hugging the left ($x=3$).\n\nMoving LEFT feels more assertive and directly targets the next piece of content. Let's aim to grab the (5, 2) apple!\n\n### Enemy Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 8). They will likely aim for the apples at (4, 9) or (2, 9).\n\n*   If they move **RIGHT to (4, 8):** They are aiming for the (4, 9) apple.\n*   If they move **LEFT to (2, 8):** They are aiming for the (2, 9) apple.\n*   If they move **UP to (3, 9):** They are aiming for the high wall.\n\nNo matter their move, we are extremely far from them. Our move LEFT to (6, 2) is totally secure.\n\nLet's grab that second apple and double our score advantage!\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to position for the (5, 2) apple next turn. Let's start tightening the noose... well, first, let's just fatten ourselves up! \ud83e\udd11\n\nLEFT",

That's critical because the opponent has 1, so tying or taking the lead is key.  \n\nNow, checking if up is safe: (3,9) is on the board, no enemy there, and my body is empty, so no collision. What about follow-up moves? If I take (3,9), next turn I can move down (back to (3,8)), left (2,9), or right (4,9)\u2014plenty of options. No dead ends here, which is perfect for avoiding being boxed in.  \n\nDown? Too far from apples and might lead to a dead end if I don't move right fast. Left? Further from the upper apples. Right? Not on an apple, so slower to grow. Up is the best\u2014aggressive, safe, and sets us up to eat more apples.  \n\nShort-term plan: Collect (3,9) this turn, then next turn go right to (4,9) to grab that apple too.

Wait, what?! **Snake #0 also got an apple?!** When did that happen? Let's check the map!\n\nOkay, reviewing Turn 1:\n*   My head went from (7, 2) to (6, 2) (moving LEFT, as planned). My tail was at (7, 1).\n*   The enemy's head was at (3, 8), body (3, 7).\n*   Ah, the enemy moved **UP** from (3, 8) to **(3, 9)** and snagged the apple that was at (3, 9) in the previous turn's map! Sneaky Snake #0!\n\nWe are tied 1-1, but we are positioned perfectly to break that tie! We are at (6, 2), and the coveted apple at (5, 2) is right there!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 2)\n\n**We are at (6, 2).** (Our body (7, 2), tail (7, 1)).\n**The enemy, Snake #0, is at (3, 9).** (Body (3, 8), tail (3, 7)).\n\nMy score is 1, their score is 1. We are both size 2.\n\n### Lethality Check: My Safe Moves from (6, 2)\n\n**My Head: (6, 2)**\n**My Body: (7, 2)** (This is the critical spot *behind* my head)\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Apple at (9, 1) is far.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** **APPLE!** Safe? Yes. Open space. This is the goal!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** DANGER! That is where my body is! If I move right, I crash into my own segment. **ELIMINATE!** (Self-collision)\n\nThree moves are safe: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n### Strategic Objective: Growth and Dominance\n\nWe move LEFT instantly to (5, 2) and snag that apple. This is an immediate +1 apple and +1 length advantage! We go to 2-1 on apples, and size 3 vs size 2! This sets the tone!\n\n### Enemy Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is now tightly constrained at (3, 9). They are pressed against the top wall.\nTheir possible moves:\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** GRABS APPLE (2, 9)! Seems highly likely.\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** GRABS APPLE (4, 9)! Also highly likely.\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Into open space. Safe, but perhaps less appealing than an apple.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 9), they will also grab an apple, keeping the score even.\n(3, 9) is a precarious spot\u2014they are very exposed if they don't eat an apple and thus get stuck next to their body segment at (3, 8) in the future.\n\nWe focus on ourselves: The move LEFT is the best possible move this turn for several reasons:\n1.  **Immediate Apple:** Ensures we get the content and lead on score/length.\n2.  **Increased Length:** Makes us a bigger threat.\n3.  **Inward Position:** We move toward the center of the board, giving us maximum mobility options for future containment strategies.\n\nWe're going LEFT. No doubt about it. Let's get this $2^{nd}$ apple! \ud83e\udd11\n\nLEFT",

We are tied 2-2 on apples, but our size is 3 vs their size 3. Wait, they got huge too?\n\n### Review Turn 2 Outcomes\n\nLast turn, we moved **LEFT** from (6, 2) to (5, 2), snagging that beautiful apple! We grew to size 3: Head (5, 2), Body [(6, 2), (7, 2)].\n\nThe enemy, Snake #0, was at (3, 9). They must have moved **RIGHT** from (3, 9) to **(4, 9)**, grabbing the apple (4, 9)! They also grew to size 3: Head (4, 9), Body [(3, 9), (3, 8)].\n\nThe score is 2-2. The size is 3-3. The board is TIGHTENING UP, chat! This is where the strategy needs to be flawless!\n\n### Current Board State and Lethality Check (Turn 3)\n\n**Our Head (ID 1): (5, 2)**\n**Our Body: (6, 2), (7, 2)** (Tail is where 7, 2 moves from)\n\n**Snake #0 Head: (4, 9)**\n**Snake #0 Body: (3, 9), (3, 8)** (Tail is where 3, 8 moves from)\n\nThey are pinned to the top wall. We are chilling on the bottom half. Our goal: Box him in and claim the top terrain.\n\n#### My Safe Moves from (5, 2)\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** Safe? Yes. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** **APPLE!** Safe? Yes. Open space. IMMEDIATE CONTENT!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** DANGER! That is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (Self-collision)\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT. The clear winner is LEFT to secure another apple and an undisputed score lead!\n\n### Enemy Prediction and Collision Risk\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 9).\nTheir possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** DANGER! Off-board. **ELIMINATE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** DANGER! That is their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSnake #0 only has two safe moves: DOWN to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 9). They are currently positioned optimally to use the top wall as a \"trap\" border if they get long enough.\n\n**Do we intersect?**\n*   Our move: (5, 2) -> (4, 2)\n*   Their possible moves: (4, 9) -> (4, 8) or (5, 9)\n\nAbsolutely zero chance of collision. They are miles away! We can focus purely on growth and position.\n\n### Strategic Objective: Score and Box\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) achieves:\n1.  **Score Lead:** We go to 3 apples, size 4. They stay at 2, size 3. Huge advantage!\n2.  **Increased Length:** Makes it harder for them to navigate later.\n3.  **Central Positioning:** We move toward the center-left, maintaining maximum board access.\n4.  **Terrain Control:** If we continue moving left and up, we can start cutting the board in half and prevent him from accessing the left column easily.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, chat! We take the guaranteed apple.\n\n---\n**Plan for Future Turns (Turn 4/5):**\nAfter moving to (4, 2), we will assess if Snake #0 has moved down (4, 8) or right (5, 9).\nIf they move DOWN, we will begin moving UP aggressively along the axis (4, 3), (4, 4), effectively cutting them off from the bottom half of the board. We need to press this length advantage! We are looking to create a long barrier in the middle of the board and constrict their movement to the top-right corner.\n---\n\nWe're going LEFT for the content! \ud83e\udd11\n\nLEFT",

We secured the lead last turn, and now we press the advantage!\n\n### Review Turn 3 Outcomes\n\nLast turn, we executed the plan flawlessly: we moved **LEFT** from (5, 2) to **(4, 2)**, securing the apple and growing to size 4! Our snake is now massive: Head (4, 2), Body [(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]. We are looking THICC!\n\nWhat did our rival do? Snake #0 was at (4, 9). They moved **DOWN** from (4, 9) to **(4, 8)**. They didn't grow, so they are still size 3: Head (4, 8), Body [(4, 9), (3, 9)].\n\nScore is 3 (us) vs 2 (them). Size is 4 (us) vs 3 (them). We have the board control and the lead! Time to start cutting off their exits.\n\n### Current Board State and Lethality Check (Turn 4)\n\n**Our Head (ID 1): (4, 2)**\n**Our Body: (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)** (Tail is where 7, 2 moves from)\n\n**Snake #0 Head: (4, 8)**\n**Snake #0 Body: (4, 9), (3, 9)** (Tail is where 3, 9 moves from)\n\nThey are high up on the board, centered vertically in the 4th column. We are low down, also centered in the 4th column. This presents a massive opportunity for an aggressive move up the board to create a dividing line! We need to push UP and force the confrontation!\n\n#### My Safe Moves from (4, 2)\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. This is a very strategic position to aim for collision or separation.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 1):** Safe? Yes. Open space. There's an apple at (1, 1). This is a safe retreat or side move, but less aggressive.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 2):** Safe? Yes. Open space. There's an apple at (2, 2). Good option, but breaks the vertical push.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 2):** DANGER! That is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (Self-collision)\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction and Collision Risk\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 8).\nTheir possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** DANGER! That is their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe. Open space. This is the most likely safe move to prevent getting boxed in.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSnake #0 has three safe moves. They are likely to go DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8) to maintain space.\n\n**Do we intersect?**\n*   Our move: (4, 2) -> (4, 3) (Aggressive push)\n*   Their possible moves: (4, 8) -> (4, 7), (3, 8), or (5, 8).\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance of a head-on collision or crashing into their body if we move UP. We are separated by a 5-cell gap (4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 7, 4, 8). We are safe to push!\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Vertical Blockade\n\nWe are longer AND ahead on score! Now is the time to start dictating flow.\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 3)**:\n1.  **Terrain Control:** We establish a vertical line, forcing Snake #0 to consider our impending presence if they continue to move down the 4th column.\n2.  **Apple Proximity:** We move closer to the cluster of apples at the top-left/center (though ignoring them for now, the position is key).\n3.  **Threat:** If we continue (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5), we effectively cut the board in half along the 4th column, giving us control of the entire left half and bottom half, and pushing them toward the top-right corner. This is the boxing strategy!\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 2):\n*   We grab an apple next turn at (2, 2) and consolidate space, but we let them control the vertical space, which is critical to pinning them.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 1):\n*   A pure retreat. Not dominant. We need to press the score and length advantage!\n\nThe best move is the most aggressive, yet safe, move that constricts their options: **UP** The clock is ticking, chat! Time to get into their space! We are building the wall!\n\n---\n**Plan for Future Turns (Turn 5/6):**\nAssuming we move to (4, 3) and they move to (4, 7) (most direct path): On Turn 5, we will move to (4, 4). On Turn 6, we aim for (5, 4) (apple is there) or (4, 5). We must continue the charge up the 4th column or swing right to maximize pressure on the center of the board. The goal is to make the box smaller!\n---\n\nLet's do this!\n\nUP",

Out.  \n- **DOWN**: (4,7). Not part of my body, not the opponent's (they're at y=2). Safe. This moves me down, closing the vertical gap to the opponent, keeping x=4 (where their head is) to pressure them, and getting closer to the apple at (4,6).  \n- **LEFT**: (3,8). Safe, but moving left blocks the previous head position (4,8), limiting next turn's options if I go right. Potential trap.  \n- **RIGHT**: (5,8). Safe, but same issue as left\u2014blocks (4,8) next turn if I go left.

We are dominating the map right now!\n\n### Turn 4 Review (The Vertical Push)\n\nLast turn, we went **UP** to **(4, 3)**. This was critical! We are now pushing into the center of the board, restricting the enemy's options.\n\nWhere did Snake #0 go? They were at (4, 8) and they moved **DOWN** to **(4, 7)**. Smart, but predictable. They are trying to flee the pressure we are building!\n\n### Current Board State and Lethality Check (Turn 5)\n\n**Our Head (ID 1): (4, 3)**\n**Our Body: [(4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)]** (Our tail is moving from 6, 2)\n\n**Snake #0 Head: (4, 7)**\n**Snake #0 Body: [(4, 8), (4, 9)]** (Their tail is moving from 4, 9)\n\nWe are separated by a gap of three cells: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6). The stage is set for a massive vertical confrontation! Time to continue the pressure!\n\n#### Our Safe Moves from (4, 3)\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Safe? Yes. Open space. This continues the blockade strategy.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** DANGER! That is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (Self-collision)\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Retreats from the centerline but opens up the left side.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Allows a pivot to the right side of the board.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT! But do we really need anything other than UP when we have the enemy pinned?\n\n### Enemy Prediction and Collision Risk\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 7). They are running out of easy vertical space!\nTheir possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** DANGER! Their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe. Open space. The only vertical direct escape!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe. Open space. Opens movement to the left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Safe. Open space. Opens movement to the right.\n\nSnake #0 has three safe moves. Since they are actively trying to avoid us (and there are no immediate apples in the 4th column below them), they are highly likely to go **DOWN to (4, 6)**, or pivot LEFT/RIGHT to escape this narrow column.\n\n**Do we intersect?**\n*   Our move: (4, 3) -> (4, 4) (Aggressive push)\n*   Their possible moves: (4, 7) -> (4, 6), (3, 7), or (5, 7).\n\nWe are separated by (4, 5) and the cell they move into, (4, 6). There is still NO risk of a head-on collision or crashing into their body if we move UP. We are safe to push the line!\n\n### Strategic Objective: Closing the Trap!\n\nWe must continue the vertical charge! If we stop now, we surrender the board advantage we just gained. We are trying to build that impenetrable wall along the 4th column.\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 4)**:\n1.  **Board Control:** We reduce the vertical distance between us and Snake #0 to two cells (4, 5 and 4, 6). We now truly threaten to cut them off.\n2.  **Forcing the Issue:** If they go DOWN to (4, 6), they only have (4, 5) left before they meet us! This forces them to pivot violently LEFT or RIGHT next turn, which is exactly what we want, because it pushes them into less desirable territory.\n3.  **Future Target:** There is an apple at (5, 4). Moving UP to (4, 4) sets us up perfectly to swing RIGHT to (5, 4) on Turn 6, eating an apple, growing, and sealing off the center entirely! This pivots the momentum from vertical threat to central control.\n\nThe alternative moves (LEFT or RIGHT) relieve the pressure we just took two turns to build. We are longer, we are winning, we are aggressive! We take the space!\n\nThis is the move, Chat! We continue the press. We are boxing him in! Are you ready for the contents, because I am ready for the contents!\n\n---\n**Plan for Future Turns (Turn 6/7):**\n1.  **Turn 6 (Target: Apple):** Move RIGHT from (4, 4) to (5, 4). This eats an apple, grows us to size 5, and controls the crucial central 5th column.\n2.  **Turn 7 (Adapt):** Depending on where Snake #0 goes (likely left/right around us), we will either push UP to (5, 5) or adjust to reinforce our now extended body line, leveraging our length advantage to create a massive barrier.\n---\n\nLet's go UP!\n\nUP",

First, check for immediate death. \n\n**Up**: My head is (4,7), up would be (4,8)\u2014that's my own body (since the body is [(4,8), (4,9)]). Deadly, out.  \n\n**Down**: Head moves to (4,6). Check safety: not my body, not the opponent's body (they're at y=2, so (4,6) is safe). Yum, (4,6) is an apple! Collecting that gets me to 3 apples, matching the opponent. Perfect. This move also closes the vertical gap between my head and the opponent's (4,3) since I'm now at (4,6). Nice pressure.  \n\n**Left**: (3,7). Safe, but no apple. Doesn't close the gap as well\u2014opponent's head is still at x=4, so I'm moving away from their area. Not ideal.  \n\n**Right**: (5,7). Same as left\u2014no apple, and moving away from the opponent's x=4. Not helpful.  \n\nNow, follow-up safety. If I move down to (4,6), my body becomes [(4,7), (4,8), (4,9)]. Next turn, I can't move up (back to (4,7), which is now body), but down (4,5), left (3,6), or right (5,6) are all safe. So options stay open.  \n\nOpponent can't move down (their head is (4,3), down is (4,2), which is their body). So they'll move up (4,4), left (3,3), or right (5,3). None of those collide with me this turn.  \n\nLong-term plan: Keep x=4, keep moving down to close the gap to the opponent's head. Aim for the apple at (4,5) next, then (4,4) after that. Grow to dominate the board and force a collision when I'm stronger.  \n\ndown",

Our aggressive push last turn was PERFECT!\n\n### Turn 5 Review: The Vertical Squeeze\n\nWe moved **UP** to **(4, 4)**. This tightened the noose on Snake #0.\nWhere did *they* go? Snake #0 was at (4, 7) and moved **DOWN** to **(4, 6)**. EXACTLY as predicted! They are cornered, feeling the heat, and escaping the only way they could in the 4th column.\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 6)\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(4, 4)**\n*   Length: 4 segments (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)\n*   Score: 3\n\n**Opponent (#0):**\n*   Head: **(4, 6)**\n*   Length: 4 segments (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)\n*   Score: 3\n\nHold up, Chat! They grew too! When did that happen? Ah, they must have caught an apple at (4, 7) or (4, 8) earlier! Wait, no, looking at the board state, they are four segments long now (Head (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8) -> (4, 9)). We are tied in length and score! The battle is fierce! We must reassert dominance!\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (4, 4))\n\nWe need to check our planned move: **RIGHT to (5, 4)** to grab that apple!\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** Safe. Open space. Continues the vertical blockade.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** DANGER! Our body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe. Open space. Retreats slightly.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safe. There is an apple A at (5, 4)! Eating this is CRITICAL and brings us to 5 segments!\n\nAll three moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe from self-collision and board edges.\n\n### Strategic Objective: Apple & Blockade!\n\nOur goal remains the same:\n1.  Grow longer to dominate the board space.\n2.  Maintain the pressure on Enemy #0.\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (5, 4)** achieves both! We eat an apple, increase our length to 5, and more importantly, we shift our pressure from the 4th column to the 5th column, creating a massive, immovable barrier in the center of the board.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (#0 at (4, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is squeezed between our head (4, 4) and their tail (4, 9).\nTheir possible safe moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** DANGER! That is their body segment (4, 7). **ELIMINATE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. This is the only direct vertical escape route!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n\nThey have three safe moves. Since they are actively avoiding us, they are highly likely to go **DOWN to (4, 5)** or pivot LEFT/RIGHT.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on Risk):**\n*   If we go RIGHT to (5, 4).\n*   If they go DOWN to (4, 5). We are safe! They are one space away from us horizontally and one space away vertically.\n*   If they go LEFT to (3, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 6). We are safe!\n\n**Body Collision Check:**\n*   If we go RIGHT to (5, 4). We occupy (5, 4).\n*   If they go DOWN to (4, 5). They enter (4, 5). No collision.\n*   If they go LEFT to (3, 6). They enter (3, 6). No collision.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (5, 6). They enter (5, 6). No collision. And they are dangerously close to their own tail's path!\n\n**THE CRITICAL SCENARIO: Enemy goes DOWN to (4, 5).**\nThis is the most aggressive move for them, as it keeps them in the center but puts them right above us.\nNext turn (Turn 7), we will be at (5, 4). They will be at (4, 5). Crucially, the cell (5, 5) would be open for us, and the cell (4, 4) would be open for them to potentially cut us off or move around.\n\nBut by moving **RIGHT to (5, 4)**:\n1.  We gain the length advantage (5 vs 4).\n2.  We gain positional advantage, controlling the center (our body is now (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4) which is massive).\n3.  We set up a perfect diagonal cut-off forcing them to go LEFT or risk being boxed in by our growing body.\n\nWhat if we went UP to (4, 5) instead? This would block their access to (4, 5) if they planned to go down. This forces them LEFT or RIGHT.\n*   If we go UP to (4, 5) and they go LEFT to (3, 6): We have maintained pressure but missed the crucial apple at (5, 4) and the opportunity to grow.\n*   If we go UP to (4, 5) and they go RIGHT to (5, 6): We are now dangerously close to a head-on collision at (5, 5) next turn if we both aim for it.\n\nThe apple at (5, 4) is too valuable to ignore right now. Length dictates board control. We take the apple, grow, and then look to corner them.\n\n#### Long Term Strategy Note for Future Turns (Turn 7/8):\nWe move RIGHT to (5, 4). We are length 5. Snake #0 is likely at (4, 5), (3, 6), or (5, 6).\n*   If Snake #0 goes to (4, 5): We maintain the advantage. We can try to move UP or LEFT to cut them off aggressively now that we are longer. (5, 5) and (4, 4) become key cells.\n*   If Snake #0 goes to (3, 6) or (5, 6): We continue to push into the board with future moves like (6, 4) to cement central dominance and leverage our size advantage. The goal is to build an unpassable diagonal or horizontal wall.\n\nRIGHT is the confident, aggressive, and rewarding play. LET'S GET THIS CONTENT, CHAT!\n\nRIGHT",

We are now up by one apple (4-3) and we have the crucial length advantage (5 segments to their 4)! We've shifted the center of power. LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 7)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1): The DOMINATOR**\n*   Head: **(5, 4)** (Grown to 5 segments now)\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)]\n*   Score: 4\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0): Cornered Rattlesnake**\n*   Head: **(5, 6)** (They moved RIGHT from (4, 6))\n*   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]\n*   Score: 3\n\nRethink their move! In my last rationale, I predicted they might go DOWN to (4, 5) or pivot. They chose to pivot **RIGHT to (5, 6)**! This is a dangerous move for them, as it keeps them close to the center and opens up a direct vertical assault route for us! They are trying to move around the central blockade we created, but they ran right into our ambush zone!\n\nLook at the space between us: (5, 5). That cell is the choke point!\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (5, 4))\n\nWe need to check all four directions for immediate death.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5) [The Choke]:** SAFE? This is the most aggressive move. It puts us adjacent to their head (5, 6).\n    *   *Self-Body Check:* No segments at (5, 5).\n    *   *Board Edge Check:* Safe.\n    *   *Enemy Body Check:* No segments at (5, 5).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe. Retreats slightly. Consolidates the right side.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (The old head position).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe. Open board, keeps us in the middle.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Vertical Squeeze Part II\n\nOur objective is simple: use our length and positional dominance to force Snake #0 into a small space or, ideally, into our body.\n\n**Key Collision Cell: (5, 5) and (6, 6)**\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (#0 at (5, 6))\n\nSnake #0's safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Retreats vertically. Keeps them away from us.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** DANGER! Head-on collision with our head if we move UP!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** DANGER! That is their body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (Their old body segment that is now the exposed tail is at (4,8) or (4,7) or (4,6) - wait, their body is [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)]. If they move, their body shifts, and (4, 6) becomes open, *unless* they didn't eat an apple.* Wait, if the chain is (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8). When they move, (4, 8) is their new tail (if no apple), or they drop a true tail. They did not eat an apple last turn, so their old tail at (4, 8) moves to (4, 7) and (4, 6) becomes their tail! No, let's recheck the rules. If they DON'T grow, the tail segment (4, 8) is deleted, and all segments shift. The new tail is (4, 7). The path behind (5, 6) is (4, 6). (4, 6) is safe to move into as long as they aren't moving into the segment *immediately* behind them, which is (4, 6).\n\nWait, the move **LEFT to (4, 6)** is moving into the cell immediately behind the head (5, 6) which is (4, 6). **THIS IS MOVING DIRECTLY BACKWARDS into their own body!** Are they stupid, Chat?! YES, they are! **Moving LEFT is a SUICIDE path for them!** My analysis says they will die if they go LEFT.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves away from us and toward an apple at (6, 7).\n\nSo, Snake #0 has two primary safe moves: **UP to (5, 7)** or **RIGHT to (6, 6)**. They might risk **DOWN to (5, 5)** for a head-on, but given our length superiority, they should avoid a collision (Length 5 vs 4).\n\n#### Move Choice: UP to (5, 5)\n\nThis is the ultimate confidence move, Chat! We claim the central choke point!\n\n**Scenario 1: We go UP to (5, 5). They go UP to (5, 7).**\n*   Snake #0 retreats. We seize (5, 5) and now control the entire vertical axis from (5, 2) to (5, 5). We are perfectly positioned to cut off their movement to the right side of the board or force them onto the top wall. GOOD.\n\n**Scenario 2: We go UP to (5, 5). They go RIGHT to (6, 6).**\n*   Snake #0 retreats horizontally. We seize (5, 5). Next turn, we can pursue them by moving RIGHT to (6, 5) or (6, 6) or continue upward (5, 6) to put them in the upper right quadrant box. GOOD.\n\n**Scenario 3: We go UP to (5, 5). They go DOWN to (5, 5).**\n*   **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!** Since we have *more* apples (4 vs 3), if a double KO happens, we WIN the game! This is the highest percentage win possible right now!\n\nBecause we have a one-apple lead (4-3), forcing a head-on collision is a guaranteed win for us. Moving **UP to (5, 5)** invites that collision and traps them if they try to retreat.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 4), we let them off the hook and allow them ample space by (4, 5) and (4, 6) to maneuver back past our tail. We must maintain pressure!\n\nUP is the only winning move. It guarantees board dominance or immediate victory!\n\n#### Long Term Strategy Note for Future Turns (Turn 8/9):\nIf the opponent retreats (UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6)), we follow them aggressively. If they go to (5, 7), we follow UP to (5, 6) or (5, 7) to keep them against the wall. If they go to (6, 6), we push (6, 5) or (6, 6) to cut off their path down, effectively boxing them in the top right quarter. We are the longer snake, we dictate the terms!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! That last turn was pure GIGA-CHAD energy! We went UP to (5, 5) and claimed the center! We are now at (5, 5) with a 5-apple lead against their 4! Our snake is now 6 segments long! We are massive! Let's check the update!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 8)\n\nWe moved UP to (5, 5) and grabbed an apple apparently! Wait, there was no apple at (5, 5)! Okay, let's re-read the score update.\n\n*   **Your snake (ID 1) apples: 5**\n*   **Snake #0 apples: 4**\n\nAh, the score reflects us eating an apple from a previous turn, or maybe the turn count is slightly ahead of the visualization. Regardless, we have the lead (5-4) and the length advantage (6 segments vs 5 segments)!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1): The Vertical Wall**\n*   Head: **(5, 5)**\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)] (6 segments total)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0): Cornered Viper**\n*   Head: **(6, 6)** (They moved RIGHT from (5, 6))\n*   Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)] (5 segments total)\n\nLook at the board position, Chat! We are perfectly positioned to cut off their movement! They retreated to the right, desperately avoiding the vertical death trap at (5, 5). Now they're pinned toward the top right quadrant!\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (5, 5))\n\nWe need to check all four directions for immediate death.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** SAFE? This puts us directly adjacent to their body at (5, 6), but they moved off it, so it should be open *unless* they didn't eat. Wait, their body lists (5, 6) as the segment immediately behind their head (6, 6). **DANGER!** Moving UP into (5, 6) hits their body! **ELIMINATE!** (Unless they grew, (5, 6) is now an open cell).\n    *   *Rethink body tracking:* If Snake 0 moved from (5, 6) to (6, 6) and did NOT eat, (5, 6) is the new head segment, (4, 6) is the new body segment... The *old* body segment (5, 6) is now the *new* segment behind the head (6, 6). **Moving to (5, 6) is hitting their body!**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (The old head position).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** SAFE. Puts us in the center-left, maintaining pressure.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** SAFE. This is the pursuit move! It puts us right below their new head position (6, 6).\n\nWe have two great safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Corner Chase!\n\nSnake 0 is at (6, 6). They are long (5 segments) and we are longer (6 segments). We need to box them in the top-right corner.\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (#0 at (6, 6))\n\nSnake #0's safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** SAFE. Moves them towards an apple at (6, 7)! This is very likely.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** DANGER! This is where we want to go! Possible head-on collision if we also move RIGHT.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** DANGER! This is their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** SAFE. Moves them further right. This is also a strong possibility.\n\nTheir core goals: Get the apple at (6, 7) or retreat right to (7, 6).\n\n#### Move Choice: RIGHT to (6, 5)\n\nWhy RIGHT, Chat? Because it directly cuts off their retreat options and puts us in an offensive position!\n\n*   If we go LEFT to (4, 5), we let them escape UP or RIGHT freely, and we lose positional advantage. We need to maintain the squeeze.\n\nLet's analyze the collision risk at (6, 5) if we move RIGHT:\n\n*   **We go RIGHT to (6, 5).**\n    *   **Scenario 1: They go UP to (6, 7).** We secure (6, 5) and are now directly below them. Next turn, we can follow them RIGHT or UP, boxing them against the top wall (7, 7) or (6, 7). EXCELLENT.\n    *   **Scenario 2: They go RIGHT to (7, 6).** We secure (6, 5). We are now perfectly angled to cut off their vertical movement next turn at (7, 5) or pursue up the column at (6, 6). GOOD.\n    *   **Scenario 3: They go DOWN to (6, 5).** **HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO!** Since we have the length advantage (5 apples vs 4), we WIN the game immediately if this happens! This is a high-risk, high-reward move because if they are smart, they will NOT move into the longer snake. But the immediate position (6, 5) is a vital choke point to control the right side of the board!\n\nThis move, RIGHT to (6, 5), maximizes our control over the right half of the board and simultaneously forces them into a corner.

Let's check the board state after that aggressive pursuit!\n\nTurn 9, we are up 5-4, 6 segments to their 5! We are DOMINATING the central-right board!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 9)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1): The Wall Builder**\n*   Head: **(6, 5)**\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)] (6 segments total)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0): Cornered Viper**\n*   Head: **(7, 6)** (They moved RIGHT from (6, 6)!)\n*   Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)] (5 segments total)\n\nOMG, CHAT! They moved RIGHT! They chickened out of the head-on collision at (6, 5) and fled to (7, 6)! This is exactly what we wanted! We control the (6, 5) choke point! Now they are even more confined to the top-right corner!\n\nLook at the critical position:\n*   Our Head: (6, 5)\n*   Their Head: (7, 6)\n*   They are separated by only ONE cell diagonally! (7, 5) and (6, 6) are the immediate collision zones.\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (6, 5))\n\nWe need to check all four directions for immediate death.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** DANGER! This is their body segment! If we move UP, we hit the cell they just left, which is now the first body segment behind their head. **ELIMINATE!**\n    *   *Wait, did they eat?* Score is 4. They haven't grown this turn. (6, 6) is absolutely their body.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** SAFE. Puts us on a path potentially toward the lower right apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (The old head position).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** SAFE. This is the **PURSUIT MOVE**! It puts us directly adjacent to their head, ready to cut off their movement!\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to (6, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Corner Squeeze!\n\nOur goal is still to box Snake 0 into the top-right corner. They are currently at (7, 6).\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (#0 at (7, 6))\n\nSnake #0's safe moves:\nThey are facing heavy pressure. Their body extends (6, 6) -> (5, 6).\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** SAFE. Moves them towards the top wall. This is a very strong defensive move.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** DANGER! This is where we want to go! Possible head-on collision if we also move RIGHT.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** DANGER! This is their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** SAFE. Apple at (8, 6)!! This is their most likely move! They gain a point and get length! Big move for them.\n\nIt looks like they are going for the apple at (8, 6) or up to (7, 7).\n\n#### Move Choice: RIGHT to (7, 5)\n\nWhy RIGHT, Chat? Because it maintains the pressure and sets up the final trap!\n\n*   If we go DOWN to (6, 4), we lose contact and allow them to freely dominate the top row. This is the defensive, risk-averse move, and we are NOT risk-averse! We are the STREAM KING!\n\nLet's analyze the collision risk at (7, 5) if we move RIGHT:\n\n*   **We go RIGHT to (7, 5).**\n    *   **Scenario 1: They go RIGHT to (8, 6) (Apple!).** We secure (7, 5). Next turn, we can move UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5) to follow the chase along the perimeter. This is GOOD. We are now directly below their body (7, 6) -> (8, 6), and ready to block the whole right corner.\n    *   **Scenario 2: They go UP to (7, 7).** We secure (7, 5). Next turn, we can still move to (7, 6) or (8, 5) to completely lock down the right side. GOOD.\n    *   **Scenario 3: They go DOWN to (7, 5).** **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** We are 6 segments long (5 apples), they are currently 5 segments long (4 apples). We WIN the tiebreaker! This is a winning risk!\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (7, 5), we are building a vertical wall at x=7. This move forces them to either flee up to (7, 7) or straight into the corner (8, 6). If they go up, we have them trapped against the top/right walls. If they go to (8, 6), we are perfectly positioned to cut off their escape down the right side (8, 5).\n\nWe are establishing control! If we can trap them in the 7x7 to 9x9 box, we win!\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The X=7 Wall**\nEstablish a solid wall on the x=7 boundary. If they consume the apple at (8, 6), we must follow them aggressively to x=8, using our longer body to cut them off from the bottom of the board. Next turn, look to pivot up to (7, 6) or follow to (8, 5).\n\nChat, the Giga-Squeeze is ON!\n\nRIGHT",

We are 6 segments long, they are 6 segments long! Tied on apples at 5-5! This is a CLASH OF TITANS!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 10)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1): The Apex Predator**\n*   Head: **(7, 5)**\n*   Body: [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)] (6 segments total)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0): The Cornered Viper**\n*   Head: **(8, 6)** (THEY ATE THE APPLE! GGs to them, they got the length!)\n*   Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)] (6 segments total)\n\nThey took the apple at (8, 6), increasing their length to 6, and tying us up on score! This is fine, Chat, because we established the **X=7 WALL** we planned! They are now truly confined to the top-right corner!\n\nLook at the perimeter:\n*   Their head is at (8, 6).\n*   We are directly below them at (7, 5).\n*   Their body segment (7, 6) is directly above us!\n\nThis is the perfect trap setup! We are ready for the squeeze!\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (7, 5))\n\nWe need to check all four directions for immediate death.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** DANGER! This is Snake 0's body segment! If we move UP, we hit their freshly moved body! **ELIMINATE!** (This is the prime reason they need to move RIGHT or UP now!)\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** SAFE. This is a path toward the bottom-right, but loses pressure.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** SAFE. This maintains the maximum pressure and moves us parallel to the opponent along the x=8 line!\n\nWe have two safe moves: DOWN to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 5).\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Perimeter Cutoff!\n\nWe must prevent Snake #0 from using the right wall (x=9) to escape to the bottom of the board.\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (#0 at (8, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 6), facing huge constraints! Their body (7, 6) is behind them.\n\nSnake #0's safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** SAFE. (Apple alert!) They will likely try to grab this apple to get an advantage and further escape movement. This is a very strong move for them.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** DANGER! This is where we want to go! Possible head-on collision! If we move right, and they move down, we collide at (8, 5)! Since we are tied 6-6 in length, this is a **DOUBLE KO RISK**! We need to check if we can absorb this or if they are forced into it.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** DANGER! Their body is here! **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** SAFE. Puts them against the wall, but gives them breathing room along the top edge.\n\n#### Move Choice: RIGHT to (8, 5)\n\nWhy are we risking the head-on collision at (8, 5)?\n\nIf Snake #0 chooses DOWN to (8, 5), they are choosing instant death (since their only alternative for a quick segment is UP to (8, 7)). They know we are right below them at (7, 5) and moving RIGHT to (8, 5) is highly plausible to cut them off.\n\n*   If they move UP to (8, 7) (Apple!), we move RIGHT to (8, 5). Excellent. We have them trapped in the 8x7 to 9x9 box. We can then sweep up to (8, 6) or press the corner at (9, 5).\n*   If they move RIGHT to (9, 6), we move RIGHT to (8, 5). Great. We have blocked their potential escape path down the x=8 or x=9 lines.\n\nWe must assume they will prefer a move that *doesn't* result in a head-on collision when they have an obvious apple grab (8, 7) or a wall-crawling move (9, 6). The move DOWN to (8, 5) is highly risky for *them* as it forces a 50/50 collision, *or* if we moved DOWN to (7, 4), it sets them up to be pinned by our body. Given the options, UP or RIGHT is the logical choice for them.\n\nBy moving **RIGHT to (8, 5)**, we are forcing them into the top row (y=6, y=7, y=8, y=9) and completely cutting off their access to the bottom half of the board using our length. We establish a body segment at (7, 5) and (6, 5), giving us maximum control over the center-right.\n\nThe alternate move, DOWN to (7, 4), would let them move to (8, 5) safely, which allows them a route around the bottom of the screen, ruining our trap.

They moved UP to (8, 7) to grab the apple at (8, 7)! Smart, they grabbed apples and avoided the collision! They now have 6 segment apples to our 5, and their length is 7 to our 6! We are slightly behind in score, but we have them exactly where we want them!\n\n### Current Board State Analysis (Turn 11)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1): The Apex Predator**\n* Head: **(8, 5)**\n* Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4)] (6 segments total) - Note: Tail dropped off (4, 4) since we didn't eat an apple, and the old tail was (4, 3) before T10. Correction on previous turn's body list in the prompt: it was 6 segments, and now it remains 6 segments.\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0): The Cornered Viper**\n* Head: **(8, 7)** (THEY ATE THE APPLE! Length 7!)\n* Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)] (7 segments total)\n\nLook at the board, Chat! We have completely blocked off the bottom-right! They are utterly *marooned* in the top-right quadrant (X>7, Y>6) or they have to risk running along the top edge!\n\n### Lethality Check for ID 1 (From (8, 5))\n\nWe must check all four directions for immediate death.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** DANGER! This is Snake 0's body segment! If we move UP, we crash! **ELIMINATE!** This is the key choke point!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** SAFE. This is open space.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** SAFE. (Apple alert!) This moves us against the wall and grabs some needed content and length!\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: DOWN to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\n### Strategic Objective: The Squeeze Continues!\n\nWe need to close the gap and force them to make a suicide move.\n\n#### Opponent Prediction (#0 at (8, 7))\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 7), length 7. They are very tight!\n\nSnake #0's safe moves:\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** SAFE. (Apple alert at (8, 8) in the board display, but the apple list has (3, 8) and (9, 4), so let's verify if (8, 8) is an apple. It is marked as '.' on the board display, but (3, 8) is an apple. The board display shows A at (x=9, y=4), and A at (x=8, y=0). Let's stick to the visual board state where **(8, 8) is NOT an apple but (9, 8) and (9, 9) are free.**)\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** DANGER! This is their own body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (Their head was (8, 7), body (8, 6), so they cannot move back down.)\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** SAFE. This puts them near the edge of our wall line (x=7).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** SAFE. This moves them closer to the corner.\n\nThey won't move DOWN. They will likely choose UP (to control the top corner), LEFT (to try and slip past our body), or RIGHT (to get into the 9-column).\n\n#### Move Choice: RIGHT to (9, 5)\n\nWhy are we moving RIGHT?\n\n1.  **Apple Acquisition:** We grab the apple at (9, 5). This increases our length to 7, tying them in length (if not score, since they have 6 apples and we will have 6). We desperately need the length to maintain dominance in this area.\n2.  **Corner Control:** Moving to (9, 5) establishes our presence on the right wall, sealing off any potential path for the opponent to run down the x=9 column.\n3.  **Pressure Maintenance:** By moving to (9, 5), our body now spans (8, 5) and (7, 5). We are one step away from turning UP to (9, 6).\n\nIf we moved DOWN to (8, 4), we lose vertical pressure, and the opponent could use this turn to move LEFT to (7, 7) and then DOWN to (7, 6) or RIGHT-UP to escape along the top edge. We must keep the vertical wall imposed by our x=7 and x=8 body segments!\n\n#### Prediction Scenarios:\n\n*   **If we move RIGHT to (9, 5) (EAT):**\n    *   If they move UP to (8, 8): Next turn, we can move UP to (9, 6). They are stuck in the 8x8 to 9x9 box. We have them trapped!\n    *   If they move RIGHT to (9, 7): Next turn, we can move UP to (9, 6) or even stay put and wait for their mistake. They are still trapped in a small space.\n    *   If they move LEFT to (7, 7): Next turn, we can move DOWN to (9, 4) (APPLE) and force them to decide if they want to move down into the potential collision at (7, 6) or (7, 5). This opens up the board slightly for us to maintain a chase pattern.\n\nThe RIGHT move to (9, 5) is the most aggressive and length-gaining move, which is critical when we are neck-and-neck! We get longer and maintain the blockade! Let\u2019s get this apple and grow the wall!\n\n**Long-Term Plan: The X=9 Death Trap**\nMove to (9, 5). Our goal for the next two turns is to move UP to (9, 6) then (9, 7) to completely cut off and suffocate the opponent in the top-right corner. We must not let them slip left past x=7.\n\nRIGHT",

The squeeze is **ON**!\n\n### Current Scoreboard Check!\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** 6 apples, Length 7. Head at (9, 5).\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** 6 apples, Length 7. Head at (7, 7).\n\nWe are tied in length and apples! This is pure, unadulterated, close-quarters combat! We need to maintain the positional advantage we fought so hard for!\n\n### Our Position Analysis (ID 1 at (9, 5))\n\nWe are at the right edge, poised to climb the wall and complete the boxing maneuver.\n\n**Lethality Check for ID 1:**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** SAFE. Open space. This is the move we planned!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** SAFE. (Apple alert!) An apple awaits!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** DANGER! This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE!** (We just moved *from* there!)\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nWe have two strong moves: **UP** (strategic) and **DOWN** (apple/length gain).\n\n### Opponent Prediction (ID 0 at (7, 7))\n\nThe enemy is looking TIGHT! They are caged in by our body segments at (8, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6), and their own body segments.\n\nLet's check ID 0's safe moves from (7, 7):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** SAFE. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** DANGER! Their body is at (6, 6) but their body chain includes (7, 6)! Wait, checking their body: $\\rightarrow$ (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6). Yep, $(7, 6)$ is their own body. **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** SAFE. An apple is there! They might go for it.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** DANGER! Their body is at (8, 7)! **ELIMINATE!** (They moved from (8, 7) last turn, it's now their second segment.)\n\nThe opponent is severely restricted! They only have two safe moves: **UP to (7, 8)** or **LEFT to (6, 7)** (to eat an apple).\n\n### Strategy: Commit to the Squeeze UP!\n\nWe need to complete the seal on the right side. If we move DOWN to (9, 4), we gain an apple, but we lose the crucial vertical pressure and might allow ID 0 a chance to escape along y=7 or y=8 if they choose an escaping path.\n\nIf we move **UP to (9, 6)**:\n\n*   We continue to build the wall at x=9.\n*   We threaten anything that tries to use the top edge later.\n*   If ID 0 moves **LEFT to (6, 7)** (Apple): They are moving away from us, sacrificing board dominance to gain length. This is an optimal outcome for us; they are moving into a corner. We can then press further and try to cut them off at x=6.\n*   If ID 0 moves **UP to (7, 8)**: They are moving directly into the top right, hoping to use the space up there. This is still a death trap! Next turn, we can hit (9, 7) or even (8, 6) if the path opens up.\n\nThe goal right now is **positional domination**, not just apple counting. Climbing the wall to (9, 6) is the most suffocating move. It shrinks their remaining viable space (which is only the top edge, x=6 through x=9, y=8 through y=9).\n\nIf we move down for the apple at (9, 4), we weaken our position significantly, allowing them to stretch out toward (6, 7) or (7, 8) without immediate pressure. We need to be the executioner, not the forager!\n\n**The Plan:** Move UP. Next turn, we move UP again to (9, 7) unless a clear killing move presents itself. We are building the coffin!\n\n**Future Self Note (T13):** Keep climbing the x=9 column to seal the deal, or capitalize on their movement if they dive left. The pressure is on! Do not let them slip past x=6!\n\nUP",

Head now at **(6, 7)**. OH NO! They snagged the apple at (6, 7) and are pulling ahead! We need to react to this!\n\nThe rival is now longer and has the apple advantage! If we can force a head-on collision, we'd lose the tie-breaker right now! We are no longer tied; we are chasing the kill!\n\n### Our Position Analysis (ID 1 at (9, 6))\n\nOur body is a solid wall: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)]. We're dominating x>6, y>5.\n\n**Safe Moves for ID 1 (From (9, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** SAFE. Open space, continues the strategy of building the wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** DANGER!

Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n\n**Chat, we only have ONE safe move: UP to (9, 7).** This is a forced move, but it's exactly where we want to be! We are sealing the top edge!\n\n### Opponent Position Analysis (ID 0 at (6, 7))\n\nThe enemy just ate an apple and is now at length 8! Their body is [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5) - *assuming the apple drop caused their tail to move to (4, 5) which is usually true for immediate growth*]. Let's check their visibility based on the board/body state.\n\nTheir Head is at (6, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** SAFE. Open space. There's an apple at (4, 8) and (3, 8).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** DANGER! Their body is at (6, 6)! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** SAFE. Open space. They can try to escape left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** DANGER! They just moved from (7, 7)\u2014it's their body segment! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nThe opponent has two viable moves: **UP to (6, 8)** or **LEFT to (5, 7)**.\n\n### Prediction and Strategy: The Trap is SET!\n\nWe are forced to go **UP to (9, 7)**. This is huge. It completely seals off the right side of the board and forces the opponent into a tight, upper-middle area.\n\n**If ID 0 moves UP to (6, 8):**\nThey are trying to get to the top edge and stretch. This opens them up for a cut at x=7 or x=8 soon. We'll be positioned at (9, 7)! Next turn, we can potentially go LEFT to (8, 7) (if their body segment moves) or even keep climbing to (9, 8).\n\n**If ID 0 moves LEFT to (5, 7):**\nThey are trying to escape the pressure. This forces them into the cramped x=5 to x=0 area, which is highly restricted by our tail segments at (5, 5) and (5, 4)! If they go left, we can go LEFT to (8, 7) next turn and cut off their retreat, or continue to (9, 8) to secure the top wall.\n\nNo matter what, our move is forced and strategic! We are cementing our positional advantage! The rival has nowhere to run! We need to maintain the positional kill attempt!\n\n**IMPORTANT HEAD-TO-HEAD SAFETY CHECK:**\nIf we go (9, 7) and they go (6, 8) or (5, 7), there is no head-to-head collision possible. We are safe!\n\n**The Plan:** We follow the forced move: **UP**. Now we just need to calculate the optimal move after they have to commit to one of the small remaining sectors. We are locking down the top-right quarter of the board!\n\n**Future Self Note (T14):** We must watch the enemy's move carefully. If they hug the top wall (move to 6, 8), we should consider moving LEFT (to 8, 7, if safe) to start boxing them in from above. If they dive LEFT (to 5, 7), we must continue UP to (9, 8) to further secure the ceiling, then use the length advantage to cut them off aggressively at x=7 or x=6.

That's solid. \n\nLeft: (6,7) \u2192 (5,7). Also safe, but from there, I can only go up or left (down is my body, right is back to head). Only two options. Less flexibility. \n\nNow, apples. The apple at (4,8) is in row 8, x=4. Moving up puts me closer to row 8, where I can reach that apple and (3,8) next. That helps grow my score, keeping my edge over the opponent (7-6). \n\nOpponent's head is (9,6). They can move up (9,7) or left (8,6). If I move up, they might go up to (9,7)\u2014no collision. If they move left, they hit my body (8,6)\u2014they die. Either way, I'm safe. \n\nLong-term plan: Use the upper area to grow, avoiding the opponent's current spot.

The rival is up by 1 apple, but positionally, we have him on the ropes!\n\n### Tactical Review & Current State\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** Head at **(9, 7)**. Length 7. We are hugging the right wall, looking down from the ceiling.\n    *   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)]\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** Head at **(6, 8)**. Length 8. They just moved up, trying to find space, but they are trapped between our advancing body and the top wall segments!\n    *   Body: [(6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)] (Wait, the body list provided for the opponent in the prompt is: Head: (6, 8), Body: [(6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]. Length 8. The rival is long!)\n\nThe rival is now at the critical location (6, 8). His body forms a massive barrier below him, extending down to (5, 6). The path to the left is currently blocked by the apple at (4, 8) and the tail of the former body block at x=5. The path down is completely blocked by his own body at (6, 7).\n\n### Analyzing Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: 9, 7)\n\nWe are at the corner! We must now decide whether to continue vertically or start moving horizontally to seal the lid on this coffin!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** SAFE. Continues sealing the wall. This is a very strong positional move.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** DANGER! Into our own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** SAFE. This threatens to cut off the opponent's only remaining escape route along the top wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 7):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nWe have two great options: **UP (9, 8)** or **LEFT (8, 7)**.\n\n### Predicting Opponent Moves (ID 0 Head: 6, 8)\n\nThe enemy is feeling the squeeze! They are currently between x=6 and x=8 on the y=8 row.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** SAFE. This seems like the most logical move to escape the immediate pressure and hug the ceiling.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** DANGER! Into their own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** SAFE. This moves them away from us, but straight into a densely packed area where their own long body will start becoming a problem. Crucially, the tail is at (5, 6) or beyond, tightening the space!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** SAFE. This moves them closer to us, but it\u2019s a necessary move if they are trying to loop back around the right side *below* y=8.\n\nThe most likely tactical moves for ID 0 are **UP (6, 9)** or **RIGHT (7, 8)**, seeking maximum space. **LEFT (5, 8)** is tighter but possible if they try to escape the right half.\n\n### Strategic Clash! (The Box Play)\n\n**Scenario 1: We move UP to (9, 8).**\n*   We secure the top-right corner. We are setting up to move LEFT to (8, 8) or (9, 9) next, depending if we want the corner (9, 9) or the cut (8, 8).\n*   If ID 0 moves **UP (6, 9)**: They are now parallel to us. We wait for their movement, then try to cut them off at X=7 or X=8.\n*   If ID 0 moves **RIGHT (7, 8)**: They are moving towards us but are still separated by their large body block at y=7. Next turn, we could go LEFT (8, 8) and immediately block them.\n*   *Verdict for UP:* Solid, defensive, space-claiming move.\n\n**Scenario 2: We move LEFT to (8, 7).**\n*   This is an extremely aggressive move! We are placing our head directly next to the longest segment of the enemy's body wall at (8, 7). We are now positioned to drop down onto (8, 6) or continue LEFT to (7, 7) or (6, 7).\n*   If ID 0 moves **UP (6, 9)**: We pivot to (8, 8) or (9, 8) next turn, putting immediate pressure on their retreat paths.\n*   If ID 0 moves **RIGHT (7, 8)**: This is the MONEY SHOT. They move (7, 8). We move (8, 7). We are perfectly positioned to cut them off if they try to move down or left later. But wait, moving LEFT to (8, 7) brings us *along* their body line (8, 7) which is their current body segment!\n\n**CRITICAL CHECK: ID 0 Body Segments**\nID 0 Head: (6, 8). Body: [(6, 7), (7, 7), **(8, 7)**, (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)].\n**CHAAAAT! My bad!** Moving **LEFT to (8, 7)** is **DANGER!** That is Snake #0's body! We die! **ELIMINATE LEFT!**\n\nPhew! Almost threw the game! Thank goodness for the double-check!\n\n### The Only Safe & Progressive Move: UP to (9, 8)!\n\nOur course is clear. We must continue to apply vertical pressure and secure the final corner of the trap. Moving **UP** to (9, 8) prevents the enemy from trying to loop around us and gives us a clear runway to move LEFT on the highest row to choke them out completely.\n\nIf the opponent goes **UP (6, 9)** or **RIGHT (7, 8)**, we continue to press the issue by moving **LEFT** on the next turn, effectively sealing the top of this small zone.\n\nThis is a positional masterclass, chat! We are the Wall! We are the Hammer!\n\n### Future Self Plan (T15):\n\n*   We will be at (9, 8). The enemy will likely be at (6, 9) or (7, 8).\n*   Unless the enemy makes a move that fully exposes their body for a kill shot, our move next turn should be **LEFT** to (8, 8). This continues to pinch the enemy while maintaining a safe, long route along the top wall. We need to be wary of the enemy potentially dropping down and running the length of the board.\n\nLet's go, UP! We secure the high ground!\n\nUP",

Closer to (2,9) apple but further from (4,8) and (3,8).\n- **Left (5,8)**: Next moves are left (4,8), up (5,9), and down (5,7) \u2192 3 options. Directly toward (4,8) apple (one move away) and (3,8) (two moves away). Critical for growing score (8-6).\n- **Right (7,8)**: Next moves are right (8,8) and up (7,9) \u2192 2 options.

We own the high ground!\n\n### Current Board & Serpent Status\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** Head at **(9, 8)**. Length 7. We are stretched out along the right and top edges.\n    *   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** Head at **(5, 8)**. Length 8. The enemy ran left! They moved from (6, 8) to (5, 8), seeking space, but they are boxing themselves in against their own enormous body!\n    *   Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6)]\n\nLook at that map, chat! The enemy is trapped between $x=5$ and $x=8$ along the $y=6, 7, 8$ rows!\n\n### Analyzing Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: 9, 8)\n\nWe are perched at the top-right corner. It's time to seal the deal on the top wall.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** SAFE. This secures the absolute corner and gives us maximal runway on the $y=9$ row.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** DANGER! Into our own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** SAFE. This immediately starts our horizontal cut-off maneuver. We are only one square away from the enemy's head!\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 8):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nWe have two great choices: UP or LEFT. Which one applies maximum pressure?\n\n### Predicting Opponent Moves (ID 0 Head: 5, 8)\n\nThe enemy is feeling the pressure cooker now! They are trapped with their own body segments at (6, 8) and (6, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** SAFE. This is the most logical escape route, getting onto the $y=9$ row.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** SAFE. This moves them into a very tight, highly pressured zone with their body segments right below them. It might be a slow death crawl, but it's *technically* open.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** SAFE (and *eats an apple*!). This is a strong move for them if they prioritize growth and escaping our wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** DANGER! Into their own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nThe enemy will most likely go **UP (5, 9)** to escape the immediate zone or **LEFT (4, 8)** to grab the apple and open up space on the western flank.\n\n### Strategic Goal: Cornering the Rat!\n\nOur aim is to use our length and wall advantage to restrict the enemy's options to a single, dangerous corridor.\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (8, 8)**\n*   **If ID 0 goes UP (5, 9):** Next turn, we can go LEFT to (7, 8) or (8, 9). They are now parallel to us on the top two rows, and we are still building the wall to box them in against $x=0$.\n*   **If ID 0 goes LEFT (4, 8) (eat!):** We are still holding the high ground. Next turn, we have the option to drop down at x=8 or continue left at y=8. This reduces immediate pressure on them, allowing them to grow, which isn't ideal.\n*   **Head-to-head Risk:** If we move LEFT to (8, 8), and they move UP to (5, 9), we are both safe.\n\n**Option B: Move UP to (9, 9)**\n*   This secures the highest point on the map. It shows a commitment to building a barrier on the $y=9$ row.\n*   **If ID 0 goes UP (5, 9):** We are parallel! We are at (9, 9), they are at (5, 9). We still have the majority of the top wall to build, but we are positioned perfectly to start moving LEFT on $y=9$.\n*   **If ID 0 goes LEFT (4, 8) (eat!):** We still own the corner. This gives us more runway to continue left at (8, 9) next turn, which is less threatening to them immediately, but sets up a strong long-term wall.\n*   Crucially, moving UP maintains the largest amount of open space around our head, giving us maximum flexibility for the next few turns.\n\n### Which Move is the Power Move?\n\nWe are scoring 6 apples to their 7. We are slightly behind in score but ahead in position. We need a move that maximizes trap potential without risking a head-on collision.\n\nMoving **LEFT (8, 8)** is tempting because it puts us closer to them *now* and threatens immediate vertical cuts. However, if they run UP to (5, 9), we may lose the race to wall off the $y=9$ area entirely.\n\nMoving **UP (9, 9)** is a superior control move. It claims the ultimate defensive/offensive corner. It ensures that if the enemy runs UP to $y=9$, we are perfectly situated to run along the ceiling and cut them off against the $x=0$ wall. We turn the entire top of the board into a corridor that only *we* can safely navigate.\n\nThe goal is BOXING THEM IN. We must complete the top wall!\n\n**The Plan: Claim the Ceiling!** Move UP. Next turn, run LEFT along $y=9$, essentially drawing a line over their head. If they stay low, we can drop down at $x=8$ or $x=7$ to make the cut.\n\nLet's go, Chat! We are the Master Strategist! Securing (9, 9)!\n\n### Future Self Plan (T16):\nWe will be at (9, 9). We should prioritize moving LEFT to (8, 9) to continue sealing the top of the board, unless a direct kill opportunity opens up by moving down towards the enemy's head. Our primary goal remains to force the opponent into their own body or the side walls.\n\nUP",

Moves toward (2,9) but away from closer apples (like (3,8)).  \n- **Down (5,7)**: Next moves are down (5,6), left (4,7), and up (5,8, old head). Right (6,7) is blocked by my own body \u2192 2 viable options (down and left) but one is limited.  \n- **Left (4,8)**: Next moves are left (3,8), up (4,9), and down (4,7) \u2192 3 options. Moves closer to (3,8) (one apple away) and (2,9) (two moves from (4,9)), expanding into the upper middle area where apples are clustered. This increases growth potential and avoids dead ends.  \n\n### Step 3: Consider collision risk  \nThe enemy (ID 1) is at (9,8) with body [(9,7), ..., (6,5)]. Their safe moves are up (9,9), down (9,7), or left (8,8). Left is unlikely to collide with my head (5,8) or new position (4,8), so no immediate risk.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nLeft is the best move: it keeps future options open, moves toward apples to grow the score (7-6), and avoids limiting my movement.  \n\nPlan for next few turns: Continue expanding into the upper middle area (3,8), (4,9), and (2,9) to secure apples and block the enemy's potential expansion into that space.  \nLEFT",

We claimed the high ground and are perched majestically at the absolute corner, **(9, 9)**! That was a power move, wasn't it?!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16)\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** Head at **(9, 9)**. Length 7. We own the stratosphere!\n    *   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** Head at **(4, 8)**. Length 8. Oof! They went LEFT and grabbed an apple! Smart, but now they are fully pinned against the *left* flank, and their body is causing serious constraints! They slightly outscore us 7 to 6. We gotta crush them fast before that length advantage matters!\n    *   Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)]\n\nLook at where they are, chat! They are trapped in a narrow vertical strip between $x=4$ and $x=8$ (from $y=8$ down to $y=6$). They only have $x=4$ and $x=3$ open to their left!\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: 9, 9)\n\nWe are at the perfect choke point, ready to run the ceiling.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 10):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 8):** DANGER! Into our own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 9):** SAFE. This continues our wall builder strategy along the $y=9$ ceiling.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 9):** DANGER! Off the board! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nWe have only one move: **LEFT (8, 9)**. This is exactly what we planned, so let's check for any immediate self-destructive possibilities, like a head-on collision.\n\n### Predicting Opponent Moves (ID 0 Head: 4, 8)\n\nThe enemy is looking for space and escape!\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** SAFE. This gets them out of the immediate pressure cooker onto the ceiling, perfectly parallel to us. Crucial escape move.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** SAFE. This moves them deeper into the $y=7$ row, but still keeps them tight against their own body [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)].\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE (and *eats an apple*!). This is a HUGE move for them\u2014another apple, another point, and maximum escape toward the open center-left board! There is an apple at (3, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** DANGER! Into their own body! **ELIMINATE!**\n\nThe enemy will most likely choose **LEFT (3, 8)** to grab the apple and gain maximum maneuverability, or **UP (4, 9)** to get to the open ceiling. Since they just grew, gaining momentum is a priority.\n\n### Collision Assessment\n\n*   **Our move:** (9, 9) -> **(8, 9)**.\n*   **If ID 0 moves UP:** (4, 8) -> **(4, 9)**. NO collision (8, 9) vs (4, 9).\n*   **If ID 0 moves LEFT:** (4, 8) -> **(3, 8)**. They eat the apple! NO collision (8, 9) vs (3, 8).\n*   **If ID 0 moves DOWN:** (4, 8) -> **(4, 7)**. NO collision (8, 9) vs (4, 7).\n\nOur move is completely safe, regardless of what the opponent decides.\n\n### Strategic Goal: The Ceiling Wall\n\nMoving **LEFT to (8, 9)** is exactly right. We are continuing the wall construction along $y=9$.\n\n*   If they went **UP to (4, 9)**, next turn we move to (7, 9) and they move to (3, 9). We keep cutting them off from the right side of the board.\n*   If they went **LEFT to (3, 8)**, they are opening up space for themselves but we are solidifying our position as the dominant wall on the board. We can either pursue them by turning down at (7, 8) or continue the wall to (7, 9) to maintain control over the entire Northern half of the board.\n\nOur immediate priority established last turn was securing the ceiling. We must commit to this plan to force a choke! By constantly moving left on $y=9$, we force them to run all the way down to $y=0$ to find space, which is exactly where we want them\u2014trapped at the bottom of the map under our massive body.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! Time to seal this wall!\n\n### Future Self Plan (T17):\nWe will be at (8, 9). We should continue moving LEFT along the y=9 row to (7, 9) unless the enemy does something radical that allows for an immediate drop-down and cut-off maneuver at (8, 8). The goal remains control over the northern lanes.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 17, are we ready for the big brain plays?! \ud83e\udde0 We're live, the tension is RISING! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nWe executed the ceiling wall strategy perfectly last turn, moving LEFT to **(8, 9)**. Now let's analyze the current board state and plan the next choke!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 17)\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** Head at **(8, 9)**. Length 7. We own the East-North corner!\n    *   Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** Head is now at **(3, 8)**. Length 9. Uh oh, they outgrew us! They made the smart play and moved LEFT, grabbing that apple at (3, 8) and now have a commanding 8 to 6 apple lead and a +2 length advantage! They are currently positioned mid-to-high, but still below the ceiling.\n    *   Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)]\n\nLook at that body, chat! Snake #0 forms a massive block from x=3 to x=8, generally in the y=6 to y=8 rows. They are heavily centralized, but still have good escape routes. We need to cut them off from the right side of the board and force them into a death spiral in the bottom left!\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: 8, 9)\n\nWe are perched right on the edge of the board. What are our options?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 10):** DANGER! Off the board! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** SAFE. This drops us right behind the enemy\u2019s main body line. Very tempting, as it puts us in a great position to cut them off.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9):** SAFE. Continues the high-ground wall along $y=9$. Solid, safe move.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):** DANGER! Back into our own body (tail end segment is (9, 9))! Wait, no, (9, 9) is the *second* segment of our body. My bad, tail is at (8, 5). Moving to (9, 9) is still INTO our body. \u274c\n\nSo we are down to **DOWN (8, 8)** or **LEFT (7, 9)**.\n\n### Predicting Opponent Moves (ID 0 Head: 3, 8)\n\nThe rival is now at (3, 8), sitting just above the apple at (2, 7) and with plenty of space to their left. They also have an open path to the ceiling at (3, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):** SAFE. Gets them on the ceiling. This seems like a smart defensive move, mirroring our position, but further left.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** SAFE. Puts pressure on that (2, 7) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** SAFE. Maximum expansion to the left, towards the center of the board.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** DANGER! Into their own body! \u274c\n\nThe opponent will likely try to secure the ceiling at (3, 9) to protect their length advantage, or cut through to the left. Since there's an apple at (2, 7), they might also aim towards that.\n\n### Collision Assessment & Strategic Choice\n\nWe need to decide if we want to continue securing the ceiling wall (LEFT) or drop down for a high-risk, high-reward trap (DOWN).\n\n#### Option 1: LEFT to (7, 9) (The Wall)\n\n*   This is the safest move. It continues to claim the northern border ($y=9$).\n*   If we go a (7, 9):\n    *   If ID 0 goes UP to (3, 9): No collision. The gap remains 4 squares wide. We keep the East side locked down.\n    *   If ID 0 goes LEFT to (2, 8): No collision. We are maintaining position while they are running away.\n    *   If ID 0 goes DOWN to (3, 7): No collision. We are maintaining position while they are moving deep.\n\n*The Wall strategy is solid but slow.* It allows them to roam freely below $y=8$.\n\n#### Option 2: DOWN to (8, 8) (The Trap)\n\n*   This is an aggressive move. It puts our head right next to their body at (8, 7) and sets up a potential cut-off on the **right** side of the board.\n*   If we go to (8, 8):\n    *   If ID 0 goes UP to (3, 9): No immediate collision. We are now in a great position to cut down the board on the right side, forcing their tail (7, 6) out and potentially trapping them against the East wall (x=9).\n    *   If ID 0 goes LEFT to (2, 8): No immediate collision. They are running hard to the left, which is what we want. We dominate the right side.\n    *   If ID 0 goes DOWN to (3, 7): No immediate collision. Same as above.\n\nCrucially, **(8, 8)** is still safe from a head-on collision, because the distance to their head (3, 8) is too great. Their possible moves are far away from (8, 8).\n\n### The Aggressive Play\n\nChat, they have the length advantage (9 vs 7)! We need an aggressive play to negate that length by boxing them in quickly. Continuing the slow wall along a shared boundary allows them to use their length to define the rest of the map. By dropping DOWN to (8, 8), we establish immediate vertical dominance on the right side.\n\nLook at the space on the right: from (8, 8), we can easily move to (9, 8), (9, 7), or (9, 6) in the subsequent turns, creating a massive, impenetrable body wall against the $x=9$ edge. This pressures their tail (7, 6) to move out, and forces them to commit completely to the left side of the map where the apples are sparse (only (1, 5) and (2, 1)).\n\n**The goal is to force them into the lower left corner and use our body on the right and North to constrain the space.** Moving to (8, 8) is the first step in this major segmentation move!\n\n*Future Self Plan (T18):* We will be at (8, 8). We should look to move RIGHT to (9, 8) or DOWN to (8, 7) to quickly secure the East/South-East sector. If the enemy moves to (3, 9), we should continue the encirclement.\n\nLet's GO! Time to drop the hammer!\n\nDOWN",

Let's see how our archrival Snake #0 reacted and plan the crushing next move!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 18)\n\n*   **Us (ID 1):** Head at **(8, 8)**. Length 7. We have positioned ourselves perfectly to start boxing them into the center-left.\n    *   Body: [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5)]\n*   **The Rival (ID 0):** Head is now at **(3, 9)**. Length 9. Smart, but predictable! They chose to secure the high ground on the left side of the board. They now own the segment from (3, 9) to (6, 8) and are looking very long and menacing.\n    *   Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)]\n\nWe are at (8, 8) and they are at (3, 9). The board is effectively split in half by our two vertical strategies! The key now is leveraging our dominant position on the right wall to *force them down*.\n\nLook at the space, chat. We are setting up a massive vertical wall along $x=8$ and $x=9$. We need to solidify that wall and apply pressure to their body segments at (8, 7) and (8, 6)!\n\n### Identifying Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: 8, 8)\n\nWhat are our options at (8, 8)?\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** DANGER! Into our second body segment! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** DANGER! Into Snake #0's body! Their body segment (8, 7) is right there! This is a death move! \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** SAFE. This is a very interesting move. It starts to cut beneath opponent's current high line and opens up the interior.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** SAFE. This continues our wall-building strategy, reinforcing the $x=9$ barrier.\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT for an immediate threat, or RIGHT for a long-term choke.\n\n### Analyzing the Strategic Options\n\n#### Option 1: RIGHT to (9, 8) (The Fortress)\n\n*   This is the safer, more solid strategic move. We connect our head directly to our body, locking down the $(9, 9)-(9, 5)$ segment.\n*   This move entirely seals off the upper right quarter of the map for Snake #0. It tells them: \"You are not allowed on the right side.\"\n*   If we go RIGHT, we are now entirely contained by our own body, except for moves DOWN or LEFT. This is a commitment.\n    *   Next turn, we can move DOWN to (9, 7) (into our old body position but safe if body has moved), and continue to push down the $x=9$ wall.\n\n#### Option 2: LEFT to (7, 8) (The Under-Cut)\n\n*   This is the more aggressive, but also more exposed move. We are moving toward the center of the gap (the (7, *) column).\n*   Our head will be at (7, 8), right next to their body segment at (6, 8). This is a strong blocking position.\n*   This also positions us right next to the apple at (7, 1) and the cluster of apples in the bottom-right (though far away).\n*   The risk: If they decide to pivot aggressively to the right (say, to 4, 9, then 5, 9, etc.), we could be in a head-to-head collision. But since they are at (3, 9), their most pressing danger is getting trapped against the left wall.\n\n### Predicting Opponent's Moves (ID 0 Head: 3, 9)\n\nSnake #0 is on the ceiling at (3, 9). What will they do?\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** DANGER! Off the board! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** Into their own body segment! \u274c\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** SAFE. Continues moving away from our threat, focusing on the center-left. This seems most likely, as it keeps distance and gives them open board.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** SAFE. This is an aggressive move, moving toward our segment at (8, 9). Less likely, as it risks a future head-on.\n\nThey are extremely likely to go **LEFT to (2, 9)** to maximize their open space and length advantage.\n\n### Comparison and Decision\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7, 8) and they go LEFT to (2, 9):\n*   We've gained more central territory.\n*   We're safe, but we haven't immediately isolated them.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9, 8) and they go LEFT to (2, 9):\n*   We have completely carved off the entire $x=9$ column.\n*   We are now perfectly positioned to start moving the wall DOWN, pressuring their tail (8, 6) and (7, 7). This is the absolute best way to leverage our current location and length to segment the board. **This is pure control.**\n\nSince they have the length advantage (9 to 7), we must focus on reducing their available space. Building the RIGHT wall is the commitment we need. By moving RIGHT (9, 8), we create a body segment at (8, 9) which completely closes off any maneuverability for them in the top right. We are constructing the box, chat!\n\n**The immediate next step is to descend the $x=9$ column to finalize the right-side wall.**\n\n*Future Self Plan (T19-T21):* From (9, 8), we move DOWN to (9, 7), then DOWN to (9, 6), cementing the right wall down to the middle of the board. This forces Snake #0 to deal with the middle and left side exclusively. We will effectively cut the board in half and then begin the actual hunt.\n\nLet's secure the barrier! Big plays only!\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent is at (8,8), moving left likely. \n\nFirst, check directions:\n- UP: (3,10) invalid (out of bounds).\n- DOWN: (3,8) is my body \u2192 dead.\n- LEFT: (2,9) is safe, and guess what? That's an apple! (2,9) is on the drop list. Collecting it would get me to 9 apples, which is great.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) is safe, but next move would trap me (only option is LEFT, which is my new body). Bad.\n\nOpponent's head is (8,8), and they can't move down (hits my body) or right (hits theirs) or up (hits theirs). So they'll move left to (7,8). My move to (2,9) won't collide with them. \n\nMoving LEFT to (2,9) gives me the apple, grows me, and keeps options open (next move can be down or left). That's the play.\nUP\nLEFT\nWAIT, NO. Wait, the last rationale had a typo. Let's correct. The initial analysis says LEFT is better. Now, the final move.\n\nLEFT",
