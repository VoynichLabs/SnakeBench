My body is at (2, 8), so I cannot go RIGHT (would run into myself).\n- LEFT would take me to (0, 8) (edge of board), but no apple there, just the corner\u2014danger of getting stuck in a dead end if I continue hugging the wall.\n- DOWN is to (1, 7).

If I go LEFT, my only next available moves will be UP (to (0, 9)) and DOWN (to (0, 7)), since RIGHT would be my own body at (1, 8).

This keeps open the downward and lateral options, avoids the peril of the wall on the left, and positions me for a path toward lower apples without boxing myself in.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n- Evaluate safest progression downward toward (1, 0) and/or LEFT toward (0, 3), depending on enemy snake movements or apple changes.\n- Maintain distance from board edges unless heading for a definite apple.\n\n**Decided next move:**  \nDOWN"

No apple here, does not line up for any apple directly. Eventually still need to go DOWN or RIGHT.\n    - Walls are not a threat, but using a \"side lane\" risks getting boxed if things go wrong later.\n\n3. **UP to (1, 5):**\n    - Backtracks onto my own tail, which should be safe but is not optimal. Unnecessary loss of progress.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    - Leaves the optimal apple path. No apple to the right any time soon. Only sensible if enemy threatens the left, but that's not the current case.\n\n**Route efficiency:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3), next turn I can decide:\n    - Go DOWN to keep going for (1, 0) (quickest possible straight path apple).\n    - Or LEFT to take (0, 3) (will require one more move, but I could swing back up after collecting that, potentially grabbing adjacent apples).\n\n**Which apple to get first?**\n- Both (0, 3) and (1, 0) are nearby. Starting DOWN now keeps all options open; forced commitment will only come at (1, 3).\n- No enemy risk, no reason to hurry to (3, 5).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN is again the best move. This keeps both left apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) available, keeps me out of the wall, and on the flexible, efficient route.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nWhen at (1, 3), decide between continuing DOWN for (1, 0) (quick point) versus going LEFT for (0, 3), based on which route preserves flexibility and doesn't create dead ends. Also consider where my new tail will be for self-collision safety.\n\n**Decided next move:** DOWN"

Only sensible if enemy threatens the left, but that's not the current case.\n\n**Route efficiency:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3), next turn I can decide:\n    - Go DOWN to keep going for (1, 0) (quickest possible straight path apple).\n    - Or LEFT to take (0, 3) (will require one more move, but I could swing back up after collecting that, potentially grabbing adjacent apples).\n\n**Which apple to get first?**\n- Both (0, 3) and (1, 0) are nearby.

OPEN.\n- (0, 3): LEFT. THIS IS AN APPLE!\n- (2, 3): RIGHT. OPEN.\n\n### Options:\n\n#### 1. LEFT to (0, 3) \u2014 Get an apple immediately\n- **Pros:** Immediate point/growth. Picking up an apple safely.\n- **Cons:** Next move, would be adjacent to wall at (0, 2), so have to plan carefully to not box myself when tail grows.\n- **After growing:** My new tail will be at (1, 3), so (1, 2) stays open for quick escape.

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

My own body stays above/behind me. Still easy to turn LEFT to (0, 3) at y=3, or continue for (1, 0).\n- LEFT at this point would move me to (0, 6).

I want to avoid getting trapped at the left or bottom wall after collecting (1, 0).\n- No risk of enemy for at least several turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Continue DOWN to (1, 5), still committed to the plan.\n- After (1, 3) or so (approaching y=3), decide whether to veer LEFT for (0, 3) or keep dropping for (1, 0), depending on enemy snake position.

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Going LEFT earlier doesn't really save steps to (0, 3) \u2014 I'd have to eventually go DOWN three spaces, and efficiency stays about the same, but hugging the wall increases risk of getting boxed in.\n- RIGHT opens up the central/north apples eventually, but those are less urgent for me and not efficient at the moment.\n- UP is blocked (my own body).\n\n**Strategic notes:**\n- Stay central enough to preserve \"exit\" options after grabbing apples close to walls. I want to avoid getting trapped at the left or bottom wall after collecting (1, 0).\n- No risk of enemy for at least several turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Continue DOWN to (1, 5), still committed to the plan.\n- After (1, 3) or so (approaching y=3), decide whether to veer LEFT for (0, 3) or keep dropping for (1, 0), depending on enemy snake position. Both will remain open.\n\n**For next turn:**\n- If I get closer to y=3, reevaluate targets \u2014 possibly detour for (0, 3) if it feels safer or tactically smart to avoid hanging on the bottom wall.\n- After getting to (1, 0) or (0, 3), look to double back or go UP/RIGHT to avoid being trapped.\n\n**Decided next move:**  \nDOWN"

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

This keeps both left apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) available, keeps me out of the wall, and on the flexible, efficient route.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nWhen at (1, 3), decide between continuing DOWN for (1, 0) (quick point) versus going LEFT for (0, 3), based on which route preserves flexibility and doesn't create dead ends.

DOWN to (1, 2) \u2014 Continue for (1, 0) soon\n- **Pros:** Sets up for another apple at (1, 0) quickly, but skips immediate apple at (0, 3).\n- **Cons:** Slightly less efficient; gives up on grabbing (0, 3) for now (might have longer route to get back to it).\n\n#### 3. UP to (1, 4) \u2014 Backtrack\n- Inefficient, no apple, better to keep going forward.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT to (2, 3)\n- Not optimal for apple gathering, unless I want to circle to (3, 5), which is not as urgent/efficient.\n\n### BEST OPTION:\nLEFT is best:\n- Grabs an apple right away.\n- After moving LEFT, tail stays at (1, 3), so even though next to wall, the adjacent (0, 2) and (1, 3) are open, allowing me to move safely back or down.\n- The other nearby apple at (1, 0) can be approached next by going DOWN and then RIGHT. No immediate threats.\n\n### STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:\n- After eating apple at (0, 3), consider:\n    - DOWN to (0, 2), then possibly RIGHT to (1, 2) and then DOWN to (1, 1) and (1, 0) to get apple there.\n    - OR if enemy snakes move toward left flank, be prepared to turn RIGHT quickly.\n- Keep aware of the wall at the left side (x=0). Don\u2019t box myself in, but with growing tail, the escape route will always be freed after growth.\n- Always verify enemy snakes' movement vectors\u2014still very safe now.\n\n---\n\n### Decided next move: **LEFT**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Not bad, but not optimal.\n- **LEFT (to 1,2):**\n   - Not helpful, toward already-cleared tail\u2014but also not toward any apples.\n   - Inefficient use of space.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1):**\n   - Moves away from apples, toward nothing.\n   - Increases distance from apples, so non-optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Planning**\n\n- Keep progressing right and up toward (3,5)\u2014the low-hanging apple and eventually the others in the cluster.\n- When at (3,2), next move should be either UP or RIGHT depending on enemy position and any apple consumption.\n- Maintain high flexibility and as many open squares as possible.\n- Keep an eye on the lower left quadrant to avoid boxing myself in.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n**Best move is RIGHT to (3,2).**\n\n- Maximizes my access to the apple cluster.\n- Positions me for a flexible next move.\n- No enemy threat.\n- All alternatives inferior regarding apple collection and space control.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (3,2), evaluate whether to continue UP toward (3,5) or RIGHT toward other apples. Prioritize the (3,5) apple unless enemy is suddenly in direct competition.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple?

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple?

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

There's more than enough space, as long as I don't double back along my own body.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for next move\n\nContinue collecting apples along the path of least resistance, avoid doubling back on own growing tail, keep away from board edges, and keep monitoring the enemy snake for any strategic interception attempts.\n\n---\n\n## Decision\n\n**Move: RIGHT (to (7,6))**\n\n---\n\n**Decided move:** RIGHT\n\n(NEXT turn after this: Aim DOWN for apple at (7,5) unless situation changes!)"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Safe and Optimal Apple Collection\n- Continuing UP gets me to (3,4), making the next step (3,5) apple a certainty unless something else intervenes.\n- No enemy snake is close enough to contest, block, or intercept.\n\n### 2. Escape and Space\n- After moving to (3,4), all adjacent squares (UP to (3,5) apple, LEFT right, or DOWN) remain free.\n- I'm not near any wall.\n- After eating the apple, I can decide whether to pursue other apples or branch right/left or continue up if more apples spawn.\n\n### 3. No Risk from Self or Enemy\n- I can't move into myself, as my tail will move up, freeing up (2,2) if I continue not growing.\n- The enemy is at least 2 squares \u201cdown and to the right,\u201d far away.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

This keeps both left apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) available, keeps me out of the wall, and on the flexible, efficient route.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nWhen at (1, 3), decide between continuing DOWN for (1, 0) (quick point) versus going LEFT for (0, 3), based on which route preserves flexibility and doesn't create dead ends.

DOWN to (1, 2) \u2014 Continue for (1, 0) soon\n- **Pros:** Sets up for another apple at (1, 0) quickly, but skips immediate apple at (0, 3).\n- **Cons:** Slightly less efficient; gives up on grabbing (0, 3) for now (might have longer route to get back to it).\n\n#### 3. UP to (1, 4) \u2014 Backtrack\n- Inefficient, no apple, better to keep going forward.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT to (2, 3)\n- Not optimal for apple gathering, unless I want to circle to (3, 5), which is not as urgent/efficient.\n\n### BEST OPTION:\nLEFT is best:\n- Grabs an apple right away.\n- After moving LEFT, tail stays at (1, 3), so even though next to wall, the adjacent (0, 2) and (1, 3) are open, allowing me to move safely back or down.\n- The other nearby apple at (1, 0) can be approached next by going DOWN and then RIGHT. No immediate threats.\n\n### STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:\n- After eating apple at (0, 3), consider:\n    - DOWN to (0, 2), then possibly RIGHT to (1, 2) and then DOWN to (1, 1) and (1, 0) to get apple there.\n    - OR if enemy snakes move toward left flank, be prepared to turn RIGHT quickly.\n- Keep aware of the wall at the left side (x=0). Don\u2019t box myself in, but with growing tail, the escape route will always be freed after growth.\n- Always verify enemy snakes' movement vectors\u2014still very safe now.\n\n---\n\n### Decided next move: **LEFT**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

Assess Options**\n\n#### **3.1. Move RIGHT to (5,0)**\n- This tile has an apple. \n- Growth occurs: head moves to (5,0), rest of body remains, tail does not disappear this turn.\n- Next turn, available moves:\n  - UP (5,1): open (was empty last turn).\n  - DOWN (5,-1): wall (off board).\n  - LEFT (4,0): which I'll be partially occupying, but my tail will lag one segment so it should be open unless I\u2019d block myself.\n  - RIGHT (6,0): open.\n- No threats from enemy snake.\n\n#### **3.2. Move LEFT to (3,0)**\n- Defensive, moves away from apple, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Trapping and Next Turn Safety**\n\n- After eating the apple (RIGHT), my head is (5,0), my body is [(4,0), (4,1), ..., (5,4)].\n- My tail will remain at (5,4) for now, then (4,4) next (unless I grow on more apples in succession).\n- After RIGHT, most immediate moves would likely be UP (5,1), or RIGHT again (6,0).\n\nIs there risk of self-trap?  \nNot immediately \u2013 path is open above (5,1) and to the right (6,0). Also, going LEFT (4,0) would double back over my own body, but since my tail moves, it\u2019s potentially safe.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Snake?**\n- Their head is at (7,8), nowhere near me.\n- No conflict this turn or next.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Considerations**\n- After eating apple at (5,0), think about:\n  - Safest route to next apple. (Possibly (0,4), which is on the left wall.)\n  - Don\u2019t cut myself off from the middle of the board\u2014avoid hugging the edge forever.\n  - Watch for opportunities to move up (5,1) and head towards apples.\n  - Still plenty of empty board.\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n- Taking **RIGHT** to eat the apple is by far the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

My own body stays above/behind me. Still easy to turn LEFT to (0, 3) at y=3, or continue for (1, 0).\n- LEFT at this point would move me to (0, 6).

I want to avoid getting trapped at the left or bottom wall after collecting (1, 0).\n- No risk of enemy for at least several turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Continue DOWN to (1, 5), still committed to the plan.\n- After (1, 3) or so (approaching y=3), decide whether to veer LEFT for (0, 3) or keep dropping for (1, 0), depending on enemy snake position. Both will remain open.\n\n**For next turn:**\n- If I get closer to y=3, reevaluate targets \u2014 possibly detour for (0, 3) if it feels safer or tactically smart to avoid hanging on the bottom wall.\n- After getting to (1, 0) or (0, 3), look to double back or go UP/RIGHT to avoid being trapped.\n\n**Decided next move:**  \nDOWN"

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Assess Options**\n\n#### **3.1. Move RIGHT to (5,0)**\n- This tile has an apple. \n- Growth occurs: head moves to (5,0), rest of body remains, tail does not disappear this turn.\n- Next turn, available moves:\n  - UP (5,1): open (was empty last turn).\n  - DOWN (5,-1): wall (off board).\n  - LEFT (4,0): which I'll be partially occupying, but my tail will lag one segment so it should be open unless I\u2019d block myself.\n  - RIGHT (6,0): open.\n- No threats from enemy snake.\n\n#### **3.2. Move LEFT to (3,0)**\n- Defensive, moves away from apple, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

Also, going LEFT (4,0) would double back over my own body, but since my tail moves, it\u2019s potentially safe.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Snake?**\n- Their head is at (7,8), nowhere near me.\n- No conflict this turn or next.\n\n---\n\n## **6.

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothetical Future Planning**\n\n- If I go UP now, my next options: \n    - UP (5,2): keep climbing.\n    - LEFT (4,1): skirting lower center.\n    - RIGHT (6,1): towards board right.\n- Aim for apple at (2,2)? It's a direct path with little risk, heading diagonally up-left\u2014start progress towards that.\n- Going UP makes future turns more flexible than hugging bottom edge.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risk Assessment**\n\n- No enemy threat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No apples nearby\u2014so main goal is to stay safe and move towards next apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder to Myself for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP, check if progressing towards (2,2) is still best, or if apple/tail positions have changed.\n- Continue to prioritize central control and route optionality over hugging walls or edges.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Enemy Snake**\n- **Enemy head:** (4,0)\n- **Enemy body:** [(3,0), (2,0)]\n- **Enemy is far, not an immediate threat.**\n\n## **4.

Best Path Toward Apples**\n- **(3,5)** is easiest, and no other snake can contest it for several moves.\n- From (3,2), path is: UP, UP, UP (i.e., (3,3), (3,4), (3,5))\n- **No obstacles on the direct UP route.**\n\n## **6.

Move Options**\n- **UP (to 3,3):** Closest route to (3,5), no danger.\n- **RIGHT (to 4,2):** Moves away from closest apple, toward open area.\n- **DOWN (to 3,1):** Wastes progress, away from apples.\n- **LEFT (to 2,2):** Legal, but takes me back along my just-vacated tail segment, and is not toward apples.\n\n### **UP is strictly best:**\n- Progresses directly to the nearest apple.\n- No enemy or wall threat.\n- Leaves plenty of escape options in the subsequent turn (can go RIGHT/LEFT if needed).\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After I move UP, if enemy is still not contesting and no apples appear closer, continue straight UP toward (3,5).\n- Keep monitoring enemy for unexpected approaches or race conditions for apples above.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

Safe and Optimal Apple Collection\n- Continuing UP gets me to (3,4), making the next step (3,5) apple a certainty unless something else intervenes.\n- No enemy snake is close enough to contest, block, or intercept.\n\n### 2. Escape and Space\n- After moving to (3,4), all adjacent squares (UP to (3,5) apple, LEFT right, or DOWN) remain free.\n- I'm not near any wall.\n- After eating the apple, I can decide whether to pursue other apples or branch right/left or continue up if more apples spawn.\n\n### 3. No Risk from Self or Enemy\n- I can't move into myself, as my tail will move up, freeing up (2,2) if I continue not growing.\n- The enemy is at least 2 squares \u201cdown and to the right,\u201d far away.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it.

Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothetical Future Planning**\n\n- If I go UP now, my next options: \n    - UP (5,2): keep climbing.\n    - LEFT (4,1): skirting lower center.\n    - RIGHT (6,1): towards board right.\n- Aim for apple at (2,2)? It's a direct path with little risk, heading diagonally up-left\u2014start progress towards that.\n- Going UP makes future turns more flexible than hugging bottom edge.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risk Assessment**\n\n- No enemy threat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No apples nearby\u2014so main goal is to stay safe and move towards next apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder to Myself for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP, check if progressing towards (2,2) is still best, or if apple/tail positions have changed.\n- Continue to prioritize central control and route optionality over hugging walls or edges.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

            "rationale": "Let\u2019s recap the game state after my last move and consider the best option again:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

My own body stays above/behind me. Still easy to turn LEFT to (0, 3) at y=3, or continue for (1, 0).\n- LEFT at this point would move me to (0, 6).

I want to avoid getting trapped at the left or bottom wall after collecting (1, 0).\n- No risk of enemy for at least several turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Continue DOWN to (1, 5), still committed to the plan.\n- After (1, 3) or so (approaching y=3), decide whether to veer LEFT for (0, 3) or keep dropping for (1, 0), depending on enemy snake position. Both will remain open.\n\n**For next turn:**\n- If I get closer to y=3, reevaluate targets \u2014 possibly detour for (0, 3) if it feels safer or tactically smart to avoid hanging on the bottom wall.\n- After getting to (1, 0) or (0, 3), look to double back or go UP/RIGHT to avoid being trapped.\n\n**Decided next move:**  \nDOWN"

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

(5,8)**\n- Still directly above me.\n- Path: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), ...(5,8)\n- Is (5,4) or above blocked? **Let\u2019s check:**  \n    - My tail is at (4,3) and I move forward, so my body will extend upward, tail moves.  \n    - **No overlap.** Clear path.\n\n### **B. (2,2)**\n- To the left, but left is blocked now by my own body.\n- Would need a detour; not accessible immediately.\n\n### **Other Apples**\n- Remaining apples are much farther or less accessible due to body or wall.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Risk check**\n\nIs there any risk going up?\n- After going UP to (5,3), I\u2019ll still have empty spaces above unless my own body loops upward (not currently the case).\n- Entire column above is vacant except where my own tail may enter as I proceed, but not immediately for several moves.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Right Move?**\n\nIf I go RIGHT instead:\n- Would put me onto (6,2)\n- No apple path opens up that is better than going up.\n- Moving right only makes sense if center gets crowded, but not currently the case.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Plan**\n\n- **Go up.** Continue central, safe corridor straight toward (5,8).\n- Monitor if path ahead gets blocked as I move, or if more apples spawn closer afterwards.\n- When I eat the upper apple, check lateral possibilities for (2,2), but for now, upward is optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Move    | Safe? | Progress to Apple?            | Comments                  |\n|---------|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| UP      | Yes   | Yes (direct path to (5,8))    | Maintain center, safe     |\n| RIGHT   | Yes   | No (no apple path available)   | Move away from apples     |\n| DOWN    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n| LEFT    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Strategy note (for next turn):**\n- Keep moving up unless sighted obstacle, or an enemy approaches.\n- Reassess once near (5,8) or if situation changes (board congestion, new apples).\n- Always check that going up does not trap myself by my tail due to snaking path.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Current Snake State**\n\n- **Head:** (5,2)\n- **Body:** [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n- **Available Moves:** UP (5,3), RIGHT (6,2)  \n  *LEFT and DOWN are blocked by your body.*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Evaluate UP Move**\n\n- **UP:** Moves head to (5,3).\n    - Not occupied; safe.\n    - Directly continues the upward route toward apple at (5,8).\n    - No current obstacles. Your old tail at (4,3) is two units left, not an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Evaluate RIGHT Move**\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moves head to (6,2).\n    - Not occupied; safe for now.\n    - No apple in that direction, and could isolate you on the right edge eventually if you can\u2019t double back safely.\n    - Does not improve path to any apple.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

Enemy Analysis**\n\n- Enemy snake is far away, upper right corner, no immediate pressure on your route or apples above you.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Risks**\n\n- ONLY risk would be if you trap yourself by snaking too tightly on future moves. But at your current path, this is not a concern.\n- Continue monitoring both right and left openings as you get higher.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Continue advancing UP as long as path is clear.\n- Once close to the top or after collecting apple at (5,8), reevaluate options for lateral apples (like (2,2)).\n- Be mindful of your own tail if path loops.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**\n\n*(Note: Continue up the central corridor toward the apple at (5,8).

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple?

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

(5,8)**\n- Still directly above me.\n- Path: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), ...(5,8)\n- Is (5,4) or above blocked? **Let\u2019s check:**  \n    - My tail is at (4,3) and I move forward, so my body will extend upward, tail moves.  \n    - **No overlap.** Clear path.\n\n### **B. (2,2)**\n- To the left, but left is blocked now by my own body.\n- Would need a detour; not accessible immediately.\n\n### **Other Apples**\n- Remaining apples are much farther or less accessible due to body or wall.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Risk check**\n\nIs there any risk going up?\n- After going UP to (5,3), I\u2019ll still have empty spaces above unless my own body loops upward (not currently the case).\n- Entire column above is vacant except where my own tail may enter as I proceed, but not immediately for several moves.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Right Move?**\n\nIf I go RIGHT instead:\n- Would put me onto (6,2)\n- No apple path opens up that is better than going up.\n- Moving right only makes sense if center gets crowded, but not currently the case.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Plan**\n\n- **Go up.** Continue central, safe corridor straight toward (5,8).\n- Monitor if path ahead gets blocked as I move, or if more apples spawn closer afterwards.\n- When I eat the upper apple, check lateral possibilities for (2,2), but for now, upward is optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Move    | Safe? | Progress to Apple?            | Comments                  |\n|---------|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| UP      | Yes   | Yes (direct path to (5,8))    | Maintain center, safe     |\n| RIGHT   | Yes   | No (no apple path available)   | Move away from apples     |\n| DOWN    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n| LEFT    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Strategy note (for next turn):**\n- Keep moving up unless sighted obstacle, or an enemy approaches.\n- Reassess once near (5,8) or if situation changes (board congestion, new apples).\n- Always check that going up does not trap myself by my tail due to snaking path.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Evaluate UP Move**\n\n- **UP:** Moves head to (5,3).\n    - Not occupied; safe.\n    - Directly continues the upward route toward apple at (5,8).\n    - No current obstacles. Your old tail at (4,3) is two units left, not an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Evaluate RIGHT Move**\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moves head to (6,2).\n    - Not occupied; safe for now.\n    - No apple in that direction, and could isolate you on the right edge eventually if you can\u2019t double back safely.\n    - Does not improve path to any apple.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

But at your current path, this is not a concern.\n- Continue monitoring both right and left openings as you get higher.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Continue advancing UP as long as path is clear.\n- Once close to the top or after collecting apple at (5,8), reevaluate options for lateral apples (like (2,2)).\n- Be mindful of your own tail if path loops.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**\n\n*(Note: Continue up the central corridor toward the apple at (5,8).

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Right Move?**\n\nIf I go RIGHT instead:\n- Would put me onto (6,2)\n- No apple path opens up that is better than going up.\n- Moving right only makes sense if center gets crowded, but not currently the case.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Plan**\n\n- **Go up.** Continue central, safe corridor straight toward (5,8).\n- Monitor if path ahead gets blocked as I move, or if more apples spawn closer afterwards.\n- When I eat the upper apple, check lateral possibilities for (2,2), but for now, upward is optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Move    | Safe? | Progress to Apple?            | Comments                  |\n|---------|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| UP      | Yes   | Yes (direct path to (5,8))    | Maintain center, safe     |\n| RIGHT   | Yes   | No (no apple path available)   | Move away from apples     |\n| DOWN    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n| LEFT    | No    | -                             | Blocked by self           |\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Strategy note (for next turn):**\n- Keep moving up unless sighted obstacle, or an enemy approaches.\n- Reassess once near (5,8) or if situation changes (board congestion, new apples).\n- Always check that going up does not trap myself by my tail due to snaking path.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**"

If I go LEFT, my only next available moves will be UP (to (0, 9)) and DOWN (to (0, 7)), since RIGHT would be my own body at (1, 8). Going into the corner can reduce future mobility\u2014especially since the next apple isn\u2019t in the corner.\n- UP: (1, 9) is safe temporarily.\n- DOWN: (1, 7) is safe, and opens up more options.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Avoid the corner unless there's an apple or tactical reason.\n- Start moving down the left-most column toward apples at (0, 3) or (1, 0)\u2014long-term plan, since nobody is contesting that side yet.\n- Maintain enough space around the head to maneuver rather than walling myself in.\n\n**Best move:**\n- Move DOWN to (1, 7). This keeps open the downward and lateral options, avoids the peril of the wall on the left, and positions me for a path toward lower apples without boxing myself in.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n- Evaluate safest progression downward toward (1, 0) and/or LEFT toward (0, 3), depending on enemy snake movements or apple changes.\n- Maintain distance from board edges unless heading for a definite apple.\n\n**Decided next move:**  \nDOWN"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it.

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path?

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

Move LEFT to (3,0)**\n- Defensive, moves away from apple, less optimal.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

Also, going LEFT (4,0) would double back over my own body, but since my tail moves, it\u2019s potentially safe.\n\n---\n\n## **5.

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothetical Future Planning**\n\n- If I go UP now, my next options: \n    - UP (5,2): keep climbing.\n    - LEFT (4,1): skirting lower center.\n    - RIGHT (6,1): towards board right.\n- Aim for apple at (2,2)?

Risk Assessment**\n\n- No enemy threat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No apples nearby\u2014so main goal is to stay safe and move towards next apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder to Myself for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP, check if progressing towards (2,2) is still best, or if apple/tail positions have changed.\n- Continue to prioritize central control and route optionality over hugging walls or edges.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

(5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Evaluate RIGHT Move**\n\n- **RIGHT:** Moves head to (6,2).\n    - Not occupied; safe for now.\n    - No apple in that direction, and could isolate you on the right edge eventually if you can\u2019t double back safely.\n    - Does not improve path to any apple.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Apple Distance Check**\n\n- **UP path to (5,8):**\n    - (5,3) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 (5,8)\n    - Six steps, all open.\n\n- **Other apples require detour, but can be reevaluated once you\u2019re in the upper board.**\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Analysis**\n\n- Enemy snake is far away, upper right corner, no immediate pressure on your route or apples above you.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Risks**\n\n- ONLY risk would be if you trap yourself by snaking too tightly on future moves. But at your current path, this is not a concern.\n- Continue monitoring both right and left openings as you get higher.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Strategy for Next Turn**\n\n- Continue advancing UP as long as path is clear.\n- Once close to the top or after collecting apple at (5,8), reevaluate options for lateral apples (like (2,2)).\n- Be mindful of your own tail if path loops.\n\n---\n\n# **NEXT MOVE: UP**\n\n*(Note: Continue up the central corridor toward the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal distance, no immediate threats.)*"

Total length: 7, after eating next apple, we'll be 8.\n- **Previous move:** UP, now head is at (5,7).\n\n## 2. Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3. Enemy Snake\n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (7, 6), body at [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n- **Interpretation:** It\u2019s east of me; not an immediate threat.

Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn.

Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Safe and Optimal Apple Collection\n- Continuing UP gets me to (3,4), making the next step (3,5) apple a certainty unless something else intervenes.\n- No enemy snake is close enough to contest, block, or intercept.\n\n### 2. Escape and Space\n- After moving to (3,4), all adjacent squares (UP to (3,5) apple, LEFT right, or DOWN) remain free.\n- I'm not near any wall.\n- After eating the apple, I can decide whether to pursue other apples or branch right/left or continue up if more apples spawn.\n\n### 3. No Risk from Self or Enemy\n- I can't move into myself, as my tail will move up, freeing up (2,2) if I continue not growing.\n- The enemy is at least 2 squares \u201cdown and to the right,\u201d far away.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it.

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

My Current State\n\n- **Head at:** (5, 7)\n- **Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n- **Next up:** The tail is at (5, 1). Total length: 7, after eating next apple, we'll be 8.\n- **Previous move:** UP, now head is at (5,7).\n\n## 2. Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3. Enemy Snake\n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (7, 6), body at [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n- **Interpretation:** It\u2019s east of me; not an immediate threat. Their head is moving upwards or leftwards, but they can't get to (5,8) before me.\n\n## 4. Board Assessment\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Free (and has an apple).\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Free.\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Free.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Occupied by my body (just came from there), cannot reverse.\n- **Edges:** Not near any edges yet.\n\n## 5. Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn. Their head is two columns to the right, three squares away.\n- Enemy can't access my space in one move. Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "Let's think through this turn carefully.\n\n## 1. New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center.

(5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Their head is moving upwards or leftwards, but they can't get to (5,8) before me.\n\n## 4. Board Assessment\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Free (and has an apple).\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Free.\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Free.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Occupied by my body (just came from there), cannot reverse.\n- **Edges:** Not near any edges yet.\n\n## 5. Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn. Their head is two columns to the right, three squares away.\n- Enemy can't access my space in one move. Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5).

Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center.

(5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Their head is moving upwards or leftwards, but they can't get to (5,8) before me.\n\n## 4. Board Assessment\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Free (and has an apple).\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Free.\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Free.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Occupied by my body (just came from there), cannot reverse.\n- **Edges:** Not near any edges yet.\n\n## 5. Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn. Their head is two columns to the right, three squares away.\n- Enemy can't access my space in one move. Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Safe and Optimal Apple Collection\n- Continuing UP gets me to (3,4), making the next step (3,5) apple a certainty unless something else intervenes.\n- No enemy snake is close enough to contest, block, or intercept.\n\n### 2. Escape and Space\n- After moving to (3,4), all adjacent squares (UP to (3,5) apple, LEFT right, or DOWN) remain free.\n- I'm not near any wall.\n- After eating the apple, I can decide whether to pursue other apples or branch right/left or continue up if more apples spawn.\n\n### 3. No Risk from Self or Enemy\n- I can't move into myself, as my tail will move up, freeing up (2,2) if I continue not growing.\n- The enemy is at least 2 squares \u201cdown and to the right,\u201d far away.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it.

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

My Current State\n\n- **Head at:** (5, 7)\n- **Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n- **Next up:** The tail is at (5, 1). Total length: 7, after eating next apple, we'll be 8.\n- **Previous move:** UP, now head is at (5,7).\n\n## 2. Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3. Enemy Snake\n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (7, 6), body at [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n- **Interpretation:** It\u2019s east of me; not an immediate threat. Their head is moving upwards or leftwards, but they can't get to (5,8) before me.\n\n## 4. Board Assessment\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Free (and has an apple).\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Free.\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Free.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Occupied by my body (just came from there), cannot reverse.\n- **Edges:** Not near any edges yet.\n\n## 5. Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn. Their head is two columns to the right, three squares away.\n- Enemy can't access my space in one move. Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

Eventually still need to go DOWN or RIGHT.\n    - Walls are not a threat, but using a \"side lane\" risks getting boxed if things go wrong later.\n\n3. **UP to (1, 5):**\n    - Backtracks onto my own tail, which should be safe but is not optimal. Unnecessary loss of progress.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    - Leaves the optimal apple path. No apple to the right any time soon. Only sensible if enemy threatens the left, but that's not the current case.\n\n**Route efficiency:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3), next turn I can decide:\n    - Go DOWN to keep going for (1, 0) (quickest possible straight path apple).\n    - Or LEFT to take (0, 3) (will require one more move, but I could swing back up after collecting that, potentially grabbing adjacent apples).\n\n**Which apple to get first?**\n- Both (0, 3) and (1, 0) are nearby.

This keeps both left apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) available, keeps me out of the wall, and on the flexible, efficient route.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nWhen at (1, 3), decide between continuing DOWN for (1, 0) (quick point) versus going LEFT for (0, 3), based on which route preserves flexibility and doesn't create dead ends.

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Trapping and Next Turn Safety**\n\n- After eating the apple (RIGHT), my head is (5,0), my body is [(4,0), (4,1), ..., (5,4)].\n- My tail will remain at (5,4) for now, then (4,4) next (unless I grow on more apples in succession).\n- After RIGHT, most immediate moves would likely be UP (5,1), or RIGHT again (6,0).\n\nIs there risk of self-trap?  \nNot immediately \u2013 path is open above (5,1) and to the right (6,0). Also, going LEFT (4,0) would double back over my own body, but since my tail moves, it\u2019s potentially safe.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Snake?**\n- Their head is at (7,8), nowhere near me.\n- No conflict this turn or next.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Considerations**\n- After eating apple at (5,0), think about:\n  - Safest route to next apple. (Possibly (0,4), which is on the left wall.)\n  - Don\u2019t cut myself off from the middle of the board\u2014avoid hugging the edge forever.\n  - Watch for opportunities to move up (5,1) and head towards apples.\n  - Still plenty of empty board.\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n- Taking **RIGHT** to eat the apple is by far the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothetical Future Planning**\n\n- If I go UP now, my next options: \n    - UP (5,2): keep climbing.\n    - LEFT (4,1): skirting lower center.\n    - RIGHT (6,1): towards board right.\n- Aim for apple at (2,2)? It's a direct path with little risk, heading diagonally up-left\u2014start progress towards that.\n- Going UP makes future turns more flexible than hugging bottom edge.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risk Assessment**\n\n- No enemy threat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No apples nearby\u2014so main goal is to stay safe and move towards next apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder to Myself for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP, check if progressing towards (2,2) is still best, or if apple/tail positions have changed.\n- Continue to prioritize central control and route optionality over hugging walls or edges.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3.

Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up.

Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

Apples & Path Planning\n\n**Apples:**\n- (0,4), (2,2), (0,7), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n**Planned Path:**\n- Continue moving LEFT along the top row until (0,9), then drop DOWN twice to (0,7) and eat the apple.\n\n**Am I still on plan?**\n- Yes.\n\n## 4. Check for Safety (Enemy & Own Body)\n\n- Enemy head: (7,3), far from me.\n- Enemy body: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)\n- No threat in my region.\n\n## 5. Alternative Options & Traps\n\n- If I go DOWN, I\u2019ll end up at (4,8). There\u2019s no apple nearby and it breaks my planned sweep along the top.\n- If I go LEFT to (3,9), I am still on track to reach the top left.\n\nNothing blocks my way.\n\n## 6. Next-Turn Plan\n\n- Keep moving LEFT along y=9 (so: to x=3, then x=2, etc.)\n- When at (0,9), drop DOWN to (0,7) to collect apple.\n- Monitor enemy if it starts heading upward toward top edge; otherwise, stick to plan.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving LEFT along the top (y=9). Monitor enemy. Be prepared to descend for the (0,7) apple after reaching (0,9).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**  \nLEFT"

Immediate Plan\n\n- Continue plan: Move LEFT along the top (currently at (4,9), next to (3,9)), heading toward (0,9).\n- Once reaching (0,9), plan to move DOWN to (0,7) for the apple.\n- Monitor for surprises but plan looks good!\n- No need to divert DOWN early; safer to hug the edge, gives better visibility, and prevents unexpected traps from developing.\n\n## 4. Check for Better Move\n\nDOWN does NOT get me closer to any apple on the next turn, while LEFT continues my advance to the high-value (0,7) apple (since (0,9), then (0,8), then (0,7)). The path is clear; plus, keeping to the edge gives flexibility.\n\n## 5.

No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple.

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it. No harm, no risk.\n- But DOWN is slightly safer, as it keeps me in the more open bottom of the board, in case any enemy snake enters the lower right.\n\n## **Preferred Move: DOWN**\n- Safe, keeps more options.\n- Sets me up for easy RIGHT\u2192DOWN to get apple at (5,0).\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- If safe, go toward (5,0) and eat the apple.\n- Monitor enemy's direction (if they start heading south).\n- As soon as the tail clears (left and up), be ready to loop back toward apples at (0,4) or upward if needed.\n\n---\n\n# **DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

No apple here, does not line up for any apple directly. Eventually still need to go DOWN or RIGHT.\n    - Walls are not a threat, but using a \"side lane\" risks getting boxed if things go wrong later.\n\n3. **UP to (1, 5):**\n    - Backtracks onto my own tail, which should be safe but is not optimal. Unnecessary loss of progress.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 4):**\n    - Leaves the optimal apple path. No apple to the right any time soon. Only sensible if enemy threatens the left, but that's not the current case.\n\n**Route efficiency:**\n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3), next turn I can decide:\n    - Go DOWN to keep going for (1, 0) (quickest possible straight path apple).\n    - Or LEFT to take (0, 3) (will require one more move, but I could swing back up after collecting that, potentially grabbing adjacent apples).\n\n**Which apple to get first?**\n- Both (0, 3) and (1, 0) are nearby.

This keeps both left apples (0, 3) and (1, 0) available, keeps me out of the wall, and on the flexible, efficient route.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**  \nWhen at (1, 3), decide between continuing DOWN for (1, 0) (quick point) versus going LEFT for (0, 3), based on which route preserves flexibility and doesn't create dead ends.

DOWN to (1, 2) \u2014 Continue for (1, 0) soon\n- **Pros:** Sets up for another apple at (1, 0) quickly, but skips immediate apple at (0, 3).\n- **Cons:** Slightly less efficient; gives up on grabbing (0, 3) for now (might have longer route to get back to it).\n\n#### 3. UP to (1, 4) \u2014 Backtrack\n- Inefficient, no apple, better to keep going forward.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT to (2, 3)\n- Not optimal for apple gathering, unless I want to circle to (3, 5), which is not as urgent/efficient.\n\n### BEST OPTION:\nLEFT is best:\n- Grabs an apple right away.\n- After moving LEFT, tail stays at (1, 3), so even though next to wall, the adjacent (0, 2) and (1, 3) are open, allowing me to move safely back or down.\n- The other nearby apple at (1, 0) can be approached next by going DOWN and then RIGHT. No immediate threats.\n\n### STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:\n- After eating apple at (0, 3), consider:\n    - DOWN to (0, 2), then possibly RIGHT to (1, 2) and then DOWN to (1, 1) and (1, 0) to get apple there.\n    - OR if enemy snakes move toward left flank, be prepared to turn RIGHT quickly.\n- Keep aware of the wall at the left side (x=0).

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

(6,2), which should be open unless blocked in a few turns.\n- My tail is at (4,4) and will start vacating spaces to the left and up. For now, moving down is safe, but check if this starts building a box.\n\n#### **RIGHT (7,4):**\n- Open.  \n- Enemy snake is at (7,5), above this square. \n- (7,4) is empty now, but moving right puts me nearer the enemy\u2019s sphere. If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

Trapping and Next Turn Safety**\n\n- After eating the apple (RIGHT), my head is (5,0), my body is [(4,0), (4,1), ..., (5,4)].\n- My tail will remain at (5,4) for now, then (4,4) next (unless I grow on more apples in succession).\n- After RIGHT, most immediate moves would likely be UP (5,1), or RIGHT again (6,0).\n\nIs there risk of self-trap?  \nNot immediately \u2013 path is open above (5,1) and to the right (6,0). Also, going LEFT (4,0) would double back over my own body, but since my tail moves, it\u2019s potentially safe.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Enemy Snake?**\n- Their head is at (7,8), nowhere near me.\n- No conflict this turn or next.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Considerations**\n- After eating apple at (5,0), think about:\n  - Safest route to next apple. (Possibly (0,4), which is on the left wall.)\n  - Don\u2019t cut myself off from the middle of the board\u2014avoid hugging the edge forever.\n  - Watch for opportunities to move up (5,1) and head towards apples.\n  - Still plenty of empty board.\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n- Taking **RIGHT** to eat the apple is by far the best move.\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:**  \n**RIGHT**"

Next Strategic Considerations**\n\n- After growth, my snake is now 7 segments long.\n- No nearby enemy threat\u2014the other snake is way up in the top right region.\n- **Nearest apples:** \n    - (2,2): Diagonal up-left; a bit far, but not blocked.\n    - (0,4): On left wall, also further but open.\n    - (5,8): Directly above, but a long climb (up 8 squares!).\n- **Board center:** I am currently at bottom row near the center. Good for options.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Each Available Move**\n\n#### **UP (to 5,1):**\n- Pros: Moves away from the wall, opens up access to vertical and left/right moves.\n- Begins the (long) journey towards (5,8) or up the board for flexibility.\n- Avoids risk of boxing self in at bottom..\n\n#### **RIGHT (to 6,0):**\n- Pros: Empty.\n- Keeps me on the bottom row a bit longer.\n- But: Could start boxing myself on the bottom edge if I keep going right; less escape upward if I stay on row 0.\n\n#### **UP vs RIGHT**\n- **UP (5,1)** sets me up for more flexibility next turn. \n- Avoids risk from retracing steps over where the tail won\u2019t have cleared yet (LEFT is not valid).\n- Keeps options open: from (5,1), could go up further, or left/right easily.\n- **RIGHT (6,0)**, while safe for now, could result in running along the bottom edge excessively, which is risky if my body blocks return routes.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothetical Future Planning**\n\n- If I go UP now, my next options: \n    - UP (5,2): keep climbing.\n    - LEFT (4,1): skirting lower center.\n    - RIGHT (6,1): towards board right.\n- Aim for apple at (2,2)? It's a direct path with little risk, heading diagonally up-left\u2014start progress towards that.\n- Going UP makes future turns more flexible than hugging bottom edge.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risk Assessment**\n\n- No enemy threat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- No apples nearby\u2014so main goal is to stay safe and move towards next apple.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy Reminder to Myself for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP, check if progressing towards (2,2) is still best, or if apple/tail positions have changed.\n- Continue to prioritize central control and route optionality over hugging walls or edges.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3.

Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up.

Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

Apples & Path Planning\n\n**Apples:**\n- (0,4), (2,2), (0,7), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n**Planned Path:**\n- Continue moving LEFT along the top row until (0,9), then drop DOWN twice to (0,7) and eat the apple.\n\n**Am I still on plan?**\n- Yes.\n\n## 4. Check for Safety (Enemy & Own Body)\n\n- Enemy head: (7,3), far from me.\n- Enemy body: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)\n- No threat in my region.\n\n## 5. Alternative Options & Traps\n\n- If I go DOWN, I\u2019ll end up at (4,8). There\u2019s no apple nearby and it breaks my planned sweep along the top.\n- If I go LEFT to (3,9), I am still on track to reach the top left.\n\nNothing blocks my way.\n\n## 6. Next-Turn Plan\n\n- Keep moving LEFT along y=9 (so: to x=3, then x=2, etc.)\n- When at (0,9), drop DOWN to (0,7) to collect apple.\n- Monitor enemy if it starts heading upward toward top edge; otherwise, stick to plan.\n\n---\n\n**Decided next move: LEFT**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Continue moving LEFT along the top (y=9). Monitor enemy. Be prepared to descend for the (0,7) apple after reaching (0,9).\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**  \nLEFT"

Immediate Plan\n\n- Continue plan: Move LEFT along the top (currently at (4,9), next to (3,9)), heading toward (0,9).\n- Once reaching (0,9), plan to move DOWN to (0,7) for the apple.\n- Monitor for surprises but plan looks good!\n- No need to divert DOWN early; safer to hug the edge, gives better visibility, and prevents unexpected traps from developing.\n\n## 4. Check for Better Move\n\nDOWN does NOT get me closer to any apple on the next turn, while LEFT continues my advance to the high-value (0,7) apple (since (0,9), then (0,8), then (0,7)). The path is clear; plus, keeping to the edge gives flexibility.\n\n## 5.

(8,0) is bottom right but far from me.\n\n#### Where might the enemy go?\n- Enemy at (1,0), body at (1,1), (2,1)\n- They could move LEFT to (0,0), DOWN is illegal, RIGHT goes into their own body.\n- UP to (1,1) is blocked (their own body).\n- They can only move LEFT to (0,0) now.\n\n#### Is there any urgent threat?\n- No, enemy cannot reach me within two moves, and there's empty space. But we are both in the lower left.\n\n---\n\n### Option analysis:\n\n#### UP (to (0,3))\n- Open, and removes me from the enemy's area. Let's see if it is good for the apple path? Could be, if I decide to head up to (3,5) or (5,6).\n- This puts me further away from the enemy.\n\n#### DOWN (to (0,1))\n- Also open. Let's check if it's smart. Closer to the enemy, but if enemy always forced to (0,0), it may block my way.\n- No apple down here, but more open territory. \n- If we both snake along the edge, possibility of head-on risk increases.\n\n#### RIGHT (to (1,2))\n- Open and immediately brings me horizontally toward the center, away from the wall. \n- Would keep more options in play for future turns.\n- Eventually needed for any apple pursuit.\n\n#### LEFT (to (-1,2))\n- Wall, fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Which direction best sets up the next apple? Let's reason:\n\n- (3,5) and (5,6) are prime apples, both at column x=3 and x=5, both y=5/6.\n- To get there, I need to start moving RIGHT and UP.\n\n#### Safest, best escape direction:\n- **RIGHT:** (1,2) moves me away from the wall (which always increases flexibility in snake), and is not threatened by the enemy (enemy is at (1,0), needs 2 turns even to reach (1,2), and that's highly unlikely). \n- **UP:** good for stalling but won't get me toward apples.\n- **DOWN:** minimal benefit, puts me near the enemy and at risk if enemy loops up. No apple there.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGY DECISION\n\n- **Go RIGHT to (1,2):**\n    - Puts me off the wall, always a good safety habit.\n    - Sets up vertical moves UP toward apple clusters in the center (i.e., (3,5), etc.).\n    - Enemy snake can't threaten (1,2) immediately.\n    - Keeps maximum escape paths open: after (1,2), can continue UP, or further RIGHT, or choose vertical position.\n    - Lets me react to the enemy's move safely.\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Move  | Pros                                           | Cons      |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| UP    | Avoid entanglement with enemy                  | Doesn't approach apples |\n| DOWN  | Stays along edge                              | Near enemy, leads to crowding |\n| RIGHT | Positions me for next apples, path flexibility | Slightly toward center (no immediate threat) |\n\n---\n\n## Next turn strategy:\n- After moving RIGHT, evaluate enemy's attempt to go up (or if they're cut off), choose either UP or more RIGHT depending on apple position and traffic.\n- Look for a safe route toward (3,5) or (5,6).\n- Avoid potential traps along the left wall if enemy doubles back up.\n\n---\n\n## Decided next move: **RIGHT**"

Safe and Optimal Apple Collection\n- Continuing UP gets me to (3,4), making the next step (3,5) apple a certainty unless something else intervenes.\n- No enemy snake is close enough to contest, block, or intercept.\n\n### 2. Escape and Space\n- After moving to (3,4), all adjacent squares (UP to (3,5) apple, LEFT right, or DOWN) remain free.\n- I'm not near any wall.\n- After eating the apple, I can decide whether to pursue other apples or branch right/left or continue up if more apples spawn.\n\n### 3. No Risk from Self or Enemy\n- I can't move into myself, as my tail will move up, freeing up (2,2) if I continue not growing.\n- The enemy is at least 2 squares \u201cdown and to the right,\u201d far away.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative Moves?\n- **RIGHT**: (4,3) \u2014 opens space, but moves away from the closest apple and the optimal route\n- **LEFT**: (2,3) \u2014 doesn't advance to any apple and would stall progress, perhaps only for safety in rare scenarios\n- **DOWN**: (3,2) \u2014 backtracking, and doesn't help with apples\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn**\n- After moving UP to (3,4), I want to immediately proceed UP again to get the apple at (3,5) (if not taken or moved).\n- After eating the apple:  \n  - Check proximity of other apples\n  - Check enemy movement direction for any race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Decided next move: UP**"

If I go right, he could come down next turn (to (7,4))? Let's check:\n    - Enemy last moved from (8,4) to (7,5). His possible moves next turn: UP (7,6), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5), DOWN (7,4).\n    - Of those, (7,4) is open, but he'll probably not want to go down unless he has no choice, as that's toward me and the wall.\n- Going right gives flexibility horizontally; my left and up are blocked, so right or down are my only options.\n\n---\n\n#### **Left & Up:**\n- Blocked (own body).\n\n---\n\n## **Bigger Picture:**\n- Closest apples: (5,0) is directly downward and slightly to the left; (0,4) is directly leftward, but left is blocked.\n- Immediate threat: None from the enemy this turn.\n- My current safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT. \n\nLet's consider possible sequences:\n- If I go DOWN:\n    - Next, I\u2019d be at (6,3), and can go to (6,2), keeping toward the bottom, or possibly left toward (5,0) once my tail moves. But left is blocked for a bit still.\n- If I go RIGHT:\n    - To (7,4). Next, I risk enemy motion if the enemy chooses DOWN (to (7,4)), but it\u2019s unlikely unless he\u2019s trying to escape something else. Also, the apple at (8,9) is in that general direction, but way up.\n\n## **Trapping?**\n- Is there a risk of getting boxed in by going DOWN? As my tail currently leads left-then-up, spaces to my left and up are blocked\u2014not likely to open for 2-3 more moves. But the board is fairly open below.\n\n- Going DOWN gives me more time and avoids immediate enemy proximity.\n- If I go DOWN, I should watch out for getting hemmed in as my body clears; I can possibly PUSH TOWARD the bottom-left corner, then swing left, assuming tail clears.\n\n---\n\n# **Decision**\n\n**Best move: DOWN.**\n- Keeps me clear of enemy, avoids immediate collision, and snakes toward an apple (eventually) at (5,0).\n- My tail will soon open up more movement options leftward.\n- Continuing DOWN keeps my options open and avoids unnecessary risk.\n- I'd only switch to RIGHT if enemy becomes threatening or DOWN becomes risky/dead end.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\n- If DOWN continues to be safe, pursue (5,0) apple. Watch if tail opens left, to avoid minor self-trapping.\n- Monitor enemy\u2019s next placement\u2014do NOT let him approach from my right.\n\n---\n\n**DECIDED MOVE: DOWN**"

DOWN (4,1):**\n- (4,1) is open (per board row 1, column 4 is empty).\n- Beyond that, (4,0) is open.  \n- To the left, (3,1), to the right, (5,1).  \n- So moving down is safe now, and keeps access to a fairly open part of the board.\n- This generally moves me toward the apple at (5,0), which is only two steps away (RIGHT to (5,1), then DOWN to (5,0)), though that trajectory depends if tails are in the way.\n\n### **2. LEFT (3,2):**\n- (3,2) is open.\n- After moving here, I could try for apple at (0,4), but would need to go UP, which is currently blocked by my own body at (4,3) (meaning I'd have to loop around).\n- Not an immediate route to an apple; more of an evasive/space-claim move.\n\n### **3. RIGHT (5,2):**\n- (5,2) is open.\n- Right after this comes (6,2), which is open; heading this way brings me closer to the enemy snake\u2019s territory.\n- This also lines up slightly better for (5,0) than going down, since from (5,2) you could go DOWN\u2014so two steps to (5,0).\n- Is there any collision risk? Enemy currently up at (7,6)\u2014no.\n- Similar to DOWN, but edges closer to open east edge.\n\n---\n\n### **Which Apple is Closest?**\n- (5,0) is the nearest apple: I'm two steps away if I move either DOWN (4,2)\u2192(4,1)\u2192RIGHT(5,1)\u2192DOWN(5,0) or RIGHT\u2192DOWN.\n- (0,4) is blocked off unless looping all the way around.\n- (5,8), (8,9), (9,8) are far.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Threat?**\n- Enemy is at (7,6), pretty far.\n- No risk of immediate collision.\n\n---\n\n## **Next-Turn Planning**\n- With (5,0) in the bottom row and only me near it, grabbing it quickly is optimal.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,1) and then RIGHT to (5,1), I setup for DOWN to (5,0) for the apple afterwards.\n- No immediate threat; I won't trap myself, as left and right of (4,1) are both open, and my tail up at (6,5) is vacating away from this area.\n\n---\n\n## **Move Evaluation:**\n**DOWN** (to (4,1)) and **RIGHT** (to (5,2)) both move me toward the apple.  \nBut if I go RIGHT, then DOWN, I\u2019m at (5,1) right above the apple.  \nIf I go DOWN, then RIGHT, the same.\n\n**Small risk with RIGHT:**\n- Right (5,2): Once there, my next DOWN (5,1) is above the apple, then I get it.

Game State**\n\n- **My head** is now at (5,1), after moving UP.\n- **My full body:** [(5,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,1)] (I grew last turn, so now my tail will move on my next advance.)\n- **My tail** is at (5,4).\n- **Apples at:** (5,8), (0,4), (8,9), (9,8), (2,2)\n- **Enemy snake** is still distant at the upper right.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Checking Valid Moves from (5,1)**\n\n**Possible moves:**\n- **UP (5,2):**\n    - What's there? Empty.\n    - Not occupied by myself (my body is only on the left and below currently).\n    - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (6,1):**\n    - (6,1) is empty.\n    - No body present there.\n    - Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (4,1):**\n    - My own body at (4,1), so would collide with myself.\n    - Not safe.\n\n- **DOWN (5,0):**\n    - (5,0) is currently part of my own body (as of start of move).\n    - After moving, the tail will vacate (5,4), and the rest of the body will follow, but (5,0) will still be occupied for this move.\n    - We'd only be able to move onto (5,0) if it were about to vacate on this turn as the tail, but it is not: my tail is (5,4) and will move.\n    - Not safe (collision with self this turn).\n\nSo, **UP** and **RIGHT** are the only legal, safe moves.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Apple Proximity Assessment**\n\n**Where are apples in reachable proximity?**\n\n- **(2,2):** Diagonally up-left; 3 spaces left, 1 space up.\n    - From my current spot, I'd need to start moving left at some point, but left is blocked by my own body now.\n    - I cannot reach (2,2) immediately and must route around.\n\n- **(5,8):** Straight up\u2014can approach by going straight upwards, but it is a distance (5,2), (5,3), ... (5,8).\n    - Unblocked vertically.\n\n- **(0,4):** Far left wall; blocked by my own body for now, so not a good route now.\n\n- **Other apples (8,9), (9,8):** Both on the top right; far from my current position and more accessible to the enemy, most likely.\n\n### **Summary:** The apple at (5,8) is the only unobstructed, straightforward target from my current location, progressing straight up.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Strategic Evaluation**\n\n**Option 1: UP (to 5,2)**\n- Safe.\n- Progresses directly toward the apple at (5,8).\n- Stays in the middle vertical lane, maximizing flexibility for future side-to-side movement.\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT (to 6,1)**\n- Safe.\n- Moves me away from the center to the right edge.\n- Not optimal for long-term flexibility; could limit escape options in a crowded board.\n- No apples nearby to the right; would need to circle back if chasing any apples.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Risks**\n\n- Very low; board remains open below, and only myself could block a future route upward.\n- For future turns, as I ascend, must always check for collisions with my own tail as it winds up above.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Strategic Note to Myself**\n\n- Stick to the central corridors for maximum maneuverability.\n- Head straight up to (5,8) unless the situation changes (enemy approaches, new apples spawn).\n- Monitor Left/Right passage for safe detour to (2,2) once upper apples are eaten.\n\n---\n\n# **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**NEXT MOVE: UP**"

My Current State\n\n- **Head at:** (5, 7)\n- **Body:** [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n- **Next up:** The tail is at (5, 1). Total length: 7, after eating next apple, we'll be 8.\n- **Previous move:** UP, now head is at (5,7).\n\n## 2. Apples\n\n- (5, 8) \u2013 Directly above, at (5, 8), immediately accessible by moving UP.\n- Others: (0, 4), (0, 7), (2, 2), (3, 2); all on the far left/bottom, none near threat range by enemy.\n\n## 3. Enemy Snake\n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (7, 6), body at [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]\n- **Interpretation:** It\u2019s east of me; not an immediate threat. Their head is moving upwards or leftwards, but they can't get to (5,8) before me.\n\n## 4. Board Assessment\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Free (and has an apple).\n- **LEFT (4,7):** Free.\n- **RIGHT (6,7):** Free.\n- **DOWN (5,6):** Occupied by my body (just came from there), cannot reverse.\n- **Edges:** Not near any edges yet.\n\n## 5. Path & Safety\n\n- Going UP eats the apple at (5,8). Safe, optimal, and in line with earlier plan.\n- Once apple is eaten, next likely apples are all to the left. Logical plan: after (5,8), move LEFT towards (0,7).\n\n## 6. Enemy Concerns\n\n- Enemy can't interfere this turn. Their head is two columns to the right, three squares away.\n- Enemy can't access my space in one move. Should keep an eye on board congestion coming from the right in future moves.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of My Choices\n\n- **UP (5,8):** Eat apple, grow, gain point. Most optimal.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT:** No apples, not productive before cleaning up the upper apple.\n- **DOWN:** Not allowed (own body).\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- After eating apple, assess whether to go LEFT towards (0,7) or (0,4), or loop over the top to approach (0,7).\n- Keep monitoring enemy; if they begin shifting leftwards, speed up towards leftmost apples or consider taking the apples at (3,2), (2,2) en route left.\n- Don\u2019t trap tail or get stuck along top wall; leave myself with space to turn left.\n- Watch for possible congestion in column 5 if enemy approaches from right or I get caught following my own tail.\n\n---\n\n**MY DECIDED NEXT MOVE:**  \n**UP**"

New State after last move\n\n- **My head:** (5,8) (I moved UP last turn, just ate the apple at (5,8))\n- **My new body:** [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]\n- **Length:** Grew to 8 (assuming tail hasn't moved)\n- **My current position:** (5,8)\n\n## 2. Apples Remaining\n\n- (0,4)\n- (0,7)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,2)\n- (3,3)\n\nNone are immediately adjacent. The closest appears to be (0,7), which is to my left and one row down.\n\n## 3. My Options\n\nI need to decide where to go next. Let's analyze each move:\n\n- **UP (5,9):** \n    - (5,9) is inside the board (max y=9).\n    - (5,9) is empty.\n    - But, top edge. If I go up, in the following move, I can only go LEFT or RIGHT, but cannot continue up. Is that safe?\n    - After moving UP, no apples are reached, but it gives a straightforward path to the left along the top edge towards (0,7) (if I move LEFT).\n- **LEFT (4,8):**\n    - (4,8) is inside.\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Going left keeps me central and allows turning up if needed, but doesn't directly approach an apple; however, it positions me to \"fall\" down toward (0,7) at a future time.\n- **RIGHT (6,8):**\n    - (6,8) is inside.\n    - (6,8) is empty.\n    - Not really useful: puts me closer to the enemy and the right wall, less optimal.\n- **DOWN (5,7):**\n    - Occupied by my body\u2014illegal move.\n\n## 4. Path to Next Apple\n\n- **(0,7)** is my closest apple: x=0, y=7\n- I am at (5,8). To get there efficiently:\n    1. Move UP to (5,9)\n    2. Move LEFT along y=9 towards (0,9) (four moves)\n    3. Move DOWN to (0,8) (one move)\n    4. Move DOWN to (0,7)\u2014collect apple.\n\n- Alternatively, after UP to (5,9), I can start moving LEFT along the top edge to approach (0,7). No immediate danger from enemy or self.\n\n### Enemy Snake Check\n\n- Enemy's head: (7,6)\n- Enemy's body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9)]\n- Enemy is to the right, positioned down and right. No immediate threat of collision.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n- If I go UP to (5,9), the square is free. Enemy snake is away (right).\n- If I go LEFT to (4,8), that is also free. However, if I plan to go for (0,7), being one row lower is less optimal than the top route (along y=9).\n\n## 5. Board Congestion / Safety\n\n- No snakes near my immediate left (columns 5,4,3,2,1,0). All clear.\n- No reason not to take the top edge route.\n- Going UP also maximizes safety, hugging the wall, giving me more time to observe enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Statement (for next move):\n\n- After moving to (5,9) this turn, plan a series of LEFT moves: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9).\n- Monitor the enemy snake in case it tries to climb up and block me on the left side, but unlikely given their current position.\n- After reaching (0,9), move DOWN directly to (0,7) to collect the apple.\n\n---\n\n# DECIDED NEXT MOVE: **UP**\n\nThis move keeps me safe, on path to apples, and maximizes my future options.\n\n---\n\n**Next move: UP**"

Less efficient route for apple collection and risks boxing myself in at the edge.\n\n#### Evaluation\n\n**Sticking with the plan**: Hugging the wall is safest, keeps my potential escape paths open, and best sets up for the apple at (0,7). There's no pressure from enemies.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Keep hugging the left/top edge for a direct path to the apple at (0,7).\n- Upon reaching (0, 9), turn DOWN when safe.\n- Watch for enemy advancement, but so far they are isolated.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE:**  \n**LEFT**"
