Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nCurrent facts: our head at (0,3). Opponent head at (1,0). No bodies. Apples are sprinkled\u2014there\u2019s a juicy one at (0,5) up the column from us. We MUST avoid moving off the board (LEFT from x=0 is instant death). No funky backwards rules since we have no body, but still don\u2019t be predictable.\n\nConsider each direction:\n- LEFT \u2192 (\u22121,3): immediate death. Nope. \u2716\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (0,4): safe. Keeps options open (can go up again to (0,5) apple or right into the board). Good control of left column. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,2): safe. More open space but farther from that (0,5) apple. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,3): safe. Moves toward center; slower to contest bottom apples and gives opponent freedom on bottom row. \u2705\n\nOpponent threat check: from (1,0) they can go to (2,0) apple immediately, (0,0), or (1,1). They cannot reach our immediate next squares in one move, so no immediate head-on risk this turn. Since both scores are tied (0\u20130), we should NOT risk a head-on collision right now \u2014 we want positional advantage.\n\nDecision reasoning: I want to be aggressive but smart. Moving UP to (0,4) pushes us toward the apple at (0,5), controls the left column, and gives us multiple future exits (UP or RIGHT). That both pursues apples and builds a wall to box the opponent later. DOWN keeps options but is less proactive; RIGHT is fine but cedes the strong left-column control and the (0,5) apple. LEFT is death.\n\nShort-term plan / long-term strategy (for the next few turns):\n- Grab the (0,5) apple by pushing up, then use the vertical presence to cut the board in half.\n- After eating, pivot right and advance south to pressure the opponent\u2019s route to bottom apples; if they try to contest a narrow approach, force them into a risky head-on only when we have the scoring advantage.\n- Always keep at least two escape options when possible \u2014 don\u2019t get trapped against the wall without wiggle room.\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make the move and start the squeeze! \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc4a\n\nUP",

No risk of a head-on this turn. They already have 1 apple, so avoid forcing risky head-to-heads until we have the scoring advantage.\n\nDecision: GO FOR THE APPLE.

Up, Left, Right are the only viable options. \ud83c\udf4e Is there an apple waiting for us?

Their legal moves: UP (6,4), RIGHT (7,3), LEFT (5,3). They cannot go DOWN (6,2) because that\u2019s their neck.\n- We\u2019re ahead 6 \u2192 5. If we can force a head-on into the same cell and both die, the game ends immediately with our win (apples 6 > 5). That\u2019s a legitimate finishing tactic if we can credibly bait it.\n- RIGHT (to 6,4) directly contests the square the opponent most likely wants (UP \u2192 6,4 to chase apples up-field). If they take that bait and go UP, it\u2019s a head-on and we win instantly. If they dodge (go RIGHT to 7,3 or LEFT to 5,3), moving to 6,4 still leaves us good follow-ups: UP to the apple at (6,5) or RIGHT to expand into the mid-right quadrant.\n- UP (to 5,5) is safe and contesting the (6,5) apple path, but it\u2019s more passive and gives them room to chase without immediate pressure.\n- DOWN (to 5,3) also threatens a head-on if they go LEFT \u2014 but it gives them easier routes to apples (they can go UP afterward to 6,4\u21926,5). DOWN offers more escape options for us, but it\u2019s less direct about forcing the opponent into a fatal choice.\n\nDecision (short-term plan):\n- Be ruthless: pressure the opponent into a binary choice \u2014 collide or lose ground. We\u2019re ahead, so a double KO is a win for us. If they avoid collision, we still land in a central aggressive square with two good follow-ups (grab (6,5) or push right and hem them in).\n- Maintain at least two exits next turn. From (6,4) we have UP (6,5) and RIGHT (7,4) as solid moves if they dodge. Keep our tail and body in mind to avoid getting boxed into the left corridor.\n\nFinal call \u2014 bait the confrontation, win the game or seize control of the right-side apples.

If both heads collide we both die, but I\u2019m up 10\u21928, so a mutual kill would give me the win. That\u2019s a valid aggressive play but also a gamble if they refuse to take it.\n\nOpponent head (8,5) legal moves this turn: UP \u2192 (8,6), DOWN \u2192 (8,4). LEFT (7,5) is my body and RIGHT (9,5) is their own body \u2014 both illegal. So they can try to bait or avoid a collision.\n\nEvaluation:\n- DOWN (force head-on) is a potential instant-win if they foolishly go UP, but it hands them a free choice to avoid the collision and keeps me out of apples this turn. Do I want to gamble? Not necessary \u2014 I already lead by 2 apples.\n- UP vs RIGHT both grab apples. UP (8,8) is slightly more flexible; RIGHT (9,7) is more aggressive\u2014it seizes the edge corridor and pressures their approach to the upper-right apples (9,6 / 9,7 / 8,8). Grabbing (9,7) extends our lead further (11\u21928) and limits their safe approaches into that quadrant.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Take the apple and keep pressure on the top-right. Force them into tight choices: either contest the corridor (risking a forced head-on later when timing favors us) or give us tempo to chain apples along the right/top edge.\n- Avoid folding back into x \u2264 6 where our body cluster lives. Keep lanes open and use extra length to box them in rather than trap ourselves.\n- If they blunder toward a head-on when we hold the higher score, we\u2019ll take the mutual KO. If they avoid it, we keep eating apples and tighten the board control.\n\nTime to seal the corridor and pick the apple \u2014 let\u2019s be the bully. RIGHT",

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,7) = off the board. Dead. No thanks.\n- UP \u2192 (9,8) = safe, keeps options to corner apples on the top edge.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) = apple right there, but opponent at (8,6) can go RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) simultaneously \u2192 head-on double KO. I\u2019m up 11\u21928, so a double KO would hand us the win. Risky? Hell yes. Reward? Instant win or +1 apple and stronger board control if they fold.\n\nOpponent at (8,6) legal moves: LEFT \u2192 (7,6) or RIGHT \u2192 (9,6). They cannot go UP (our body at 8,7) or DOWN (their neck). So they can either contest the apple (RIGHT) or bail to (7,6).\n\nEvaluation & decision:\n- UP is the safe, positional play. Maintains multiple follow-ups and avoids immediate mutual death.\n- DOWN is aggressive: it grabs the apple and either forces them into a head-on (they might take it and both die, but we win with 11>8), or they avoid and we grow to 12 while they retreat to (7,6). The rules literally encourage forcing head-ons when you lead on apples. Fans want blood \u2014 let\u2019s be the bully! \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- If they contest with RIGHT and cause head-on, we take the W. If they dodge to (7,6), we eat (9,6) and then push up along the right/top edge to box them into the 6\u20137 x-range, using our extra length to restrict their escape and force mistakes.\n- Keep looking to trap their head movement options (they\u2019ll have fewer legal moves than us). Prioritize apples on the right/top edges and avoid folding back into our cramped lower-left cluster.\n\nTime to be ruthless and force the issue \u2014 let's take the apple and make them sweat.
