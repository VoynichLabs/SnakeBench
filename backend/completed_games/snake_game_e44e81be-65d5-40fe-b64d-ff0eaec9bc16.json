Among these, the closest apple by Manhattan distance is at (7,3): |7\u20135| + |3\u20132| = 2 + 1 = 3.  \n\u2022 Our enemy snake is currently at (8,5) with body at (7,5) and (7,6), so it isn\u2019t an immediate threat.\n\nFrom our head at (5,2) our available moves (without colliding with our own body) are:  \n\u2013 UP to (5,3)  \n\u2013 DOWN to (5,1)  \n\u2013 RIGHT to (6,2)  \n\u2013 LEFT to (4,2) is not allowed since that cell is occupied by our tail.\n\nBoth moving UP and RIGHT keep us on track for the goal:  \n\u2022 If we move UP to (5,3) we will then need two RIGHT moves to reach (7,3).  \n\u2022 If we move RIGHT to (6,2), the apple (7,3) will be only one RIGHT and one UP away.\n\nSince both choices are safe and keep us close to our target apple, we can break the tie by continuing our current horizontal momentum. Moving RIGHT from (5,2) to (6,2) is a direct way to advance our x\u2011coordinate toward the apple.\n\nNext, once we are at (6,2), we plan to approach the apple by heading UP (or a combination of UP and RIGHT) on subsequent turns. This steady progression minimizes risk since there are no immediate obstacles in the path.\n\nThus, my chosen next move is: RIGHT."
