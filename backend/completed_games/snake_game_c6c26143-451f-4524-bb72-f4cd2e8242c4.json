Since we move simultaneously, the enemy will move away, but if they move RIGHT, we'd collide head-on at (3,3)/(2,3).

Keeps options open.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 3,2):** Safe move, but moves away from most apples.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nThe enemy at (2,3) might go:\n- RIGHT toward me (to 3,3) - if I'm not there, they take my spot\n- UP/DOWN/LEFT toward apples or away from me\n\nThe closest apple to me is (5,3) - just 2 squares right.\n\n**Best strategy:**\nGoing RIGHT toward (5,3) is the most direct path to an apple. It's safe (no collision unless enemy also goes to 4,3, which would require them to move 2 squares - impossible in one turn).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be at (4,3), then next turn RIGHT again to (5,3) to get the apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1.

They can't reach (5, 5) this turn.\n   - No collision risk with enemy.\n   - Not into my body.\n   - Safe!\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 6, 4):** Safe, no body or walls there. No apple, but moves toward (9, 5) and (9, 2).\n\n3. **LEFT (to 4, 4):** Safe, no body there. No immediate apple.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 5, 3):** This is where my body segment is! I can't move backwards into my own body - this would kill me.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nThe enemy at (1, 5) is positioned near (1, 8). They might:\n- Go UP toward (1, 8)\n- Go RIGHT toward the center\n- Can't reach (5, 5) in one move\n\n**Collision risk check for UP:**\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), enemy can move to (2, 5), (1, 6), (1, 4), or (0, 5). None of those are (5, 5). Safe!\n\n**Best strategy:**\nGoing UP to (5, 5) immediately collects an apple. This is optimal and continues my plan from last turn!\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. This turn: UP to (5, 5) - collect apple (will have 3 apples)\n2. Then move toward (9, 5) - 4 right from (5, 5)\n3. After that, get (9, 2)\n4. Enemy is likely going for (1, 8) and (1, 0) - let them have the left side\n\n**Eliminate dangerous moves:**\n- DOWN is fatal (into my own body at (5, 3))\n- LEFT, UP, RIGHT are all safe\n\n**Best move:** UP - gets me an apple immediately and I'll have 3 apples!\n</budget:thinking>\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My position:** Head at (5, 4), Body at [(5, 3), (4, 3)] - 2 apples collected\n**Enemy snake:** Head at (1, 5), no body - 0 apples\n\n**Apple locations:**\n- (5, 5) - directly 1 up from me! \n- (9, 5) - 4 right, 1 up\n- (1, 8) - 4 left, 4 up\n- (9, 2) - 4 right, 2 down\n- (1, 0) - 4 left, 4 down\n\n**Analyzing each move from (5, 4):**\n\n1. **UP (to 5, 5):** Gets the apple at (5, 5)! Enemy at (1, 5) can't reach this in one move - they're 4 squares away horizontally.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 6, 4):** Safe but no immediate apple.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 4, 4):** Safe but no immediate apple.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 5, 3):** FATAL - this is where my body segment is!\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy at (1, 5) is closest to (1, 8). They'll likely go UP toward it. Even if they go RIGHT, they'd be at (2, 5) - still can't contest (5, 5).\n\n**Best strategy:**\nGoing UP to (5, 5) gets me an apple immediately! This follows my plan from last turn perfectly.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (5, 5) - collect apple (will have 3 apples)\n2. Next: HEAD RIGHT toward (9, 5) - collect that apple\n3. Then go for (9, 2) on the right side\n4. Let enemy have the left side apples - I'm dominating the center/right\n\nUP",

Can't move backwards.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 10, 3):** FATAL - off the board! X would be 10 which is outside 0-9 range.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 8, 3):** Safe - no obstacles there. Moves away from the (9, 2) apple.\n\n4. **DOWN (to 9, 2):** Safe AND has an apple!

They might go for (5, 9) which is 3 squares right from them. They're very far from me - no collision risk.\n\n**Collision check for DOWN:**\n- DOWN leads to (9, 2) - there's an apple there, no snake bodies\n- Enemy head at (2, 9) can't reach (9, 2) in one turn\n- Safe!\n\n**After collecting apple at (9, 2):**\nMy body will extend. From (9, 2), I'll need to be careful:\n- Can't go RIGHT (off board)\n- Can't go UP (my body will be at (9, 3))\n- Can go DOWN to (9, 1) or LEFT to (8, 2)\n\nNeed to plan escape route from the corner. After getting (9, 2), I should go LEFT to avoid getting trapped in the corner.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (9, 2) - collect apple! (Score: 6)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (8, 2) to avoid corner trap\n3. Then navigate toward (7, 6) or work around to other apples\n4. Be careful of my growing body - don't get trapped on the right edge\n\nThe apple at (9, 2) is literally one square away. Taking it is the obvious best move.\n\nDOWN",

After collecting this apple, my body will form a \"C\" shape open to the left. By continuing to move LEFT (towards x=6) on subsequent turns, I ensure I do not trap myself in the pocket created by my body loops and position myself closer to the center of the board to contest the remaining apples or new spawns.

Score becomes 13 vs 8\n- I'm right at the top edge, so next turn I can only go LEFT or RIGHT (can't go UP again)\n- After getting apple, I can head RIGHT toward (5, 5) or further right toward (8, 8) and (9, 7)\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n- Safe move\n- Misses the easy apple directly above me\n- Keeps more movement options open\n\n**LEFT to (1, 8):**\n- Safe move\n- Gets closer to wall, limiting options\n- Misses the easy apple\n\n**Best choice:**\nUP to (2, 9) is clearly the best - I get an apple immediately! Even though I'll be at the top edge, I have plenty of room to move RIGHT toward more apples.\n\n**No head-on collision risk:**\nEnemy at (9, 2) is very far from (2, 9). No collision risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (2, 9) - get apple (13 total)\n2. Next: Go RIGHT toward (5, 5) apple - need to navigate around my body\n3.

Snake 0 is to my left at (6, 8).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Safety check**:\n    *   **UP (8, 8)**: Blocked by my body (neck).\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 7)**: Blocked by my body.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 7)**: Empty. However, this moves me closer to Snake 0. If Snake 0 decides not to take the apple at (6, 9) and instead moves RIGHT to (7, 8), we would be in close proximity, reducing my escape options.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 6)**: Empty. This keeps me in column 8, shielded by my body in column 9. It moves me towards the open space at the bottom and the apple at (7, 4).\n\n2.  **Enemy Prediction**:\n    *   Snake 0 is at (6, 8) with an apple at (6, 9). It is highly probable Snake 0 will move **UP** to eat the apple.\n    *   If Snake 0 moves to (6, 9), its left side (5, 9) is blocked by its own body. It will be forced to move RIGHT to (7, 9) on the following turn, and then likely DOWN to (7, 8). This loop takes several turns, effectively removing Snake 0 as an immediate threat to my path in column 8.\n\n3.  **Strategy**:\n    *   By moving **DOWN**, I maintain a safe distance from the enemy while he is busy at the top.\n    *   My goal is to reach orbit near y=4 or y=5 to target the apples at (7, 4) and (5, 5).\n    *   A path of (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5) seems optimal to approach the apple at (7, 4) safely.\n\nPlan:\nI will move DOWN to (8, 6), continuing down column 8. This exploits the fact that Snake 0 is likely to go UP for the apple at (6, 9), which forces him into a restrictive path along the top edge (6,9 -> 7,9 -> 7,8). This gives me a few turns of safety to advance down to (8, 5) and then cut left towards the apple at (7, 4) ahead of the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Their body is at (8, 6), so they CAN'T go RIGHT. They could:\n- Move LEFT to (6, 6) - there's an apple there!\n- Move DOWN to (7, 5)\n- Move UP to (7, 7)\n- Can't go RIGHT (body at 8, 6)\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n\n**DOWN to (7, 8):**\n- Empty space\n- No apple\n- Opens path toward apples at (6, 6) and (7, 4)\n- Enemy can't reach (7, 8) this turn (they're at 7, 6 and can only move to adjacent cells)\n- From (7, 8), I could continue down toward (7, 7) which is empty\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n- Empty space  \n- No apple\n- Gets me closer to edge, might be more restrictive\n- Enemy body at (8, 8), so (8, 8) would be blocked next turn\n- From (8, 9), I could go DOWN to (8, 8)... wait, that's enemy body! So from (8, 9), DOWN is blocked by enemy at (8, 8)\n\nActually let me recheck: Enemy body includes (8, 8). So from (8, 9), going DOWN to (8, 8) would be into enemy body - FATAL next turn!\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 9), my options next turn would be:\n- UP (to 8, 10) - off board, FATAL\n- DOWN (to 8, 8) - enemy body, FATAL\n- LEFT (to 7, 9) - my own body, FATAL\n- RIGHT (to 9, 9) - need to check... empty!\n\nSo RIGHT this turn leaves me with only RIGHT next turn.

Let me check (7, 7) - that's empty. And from (7, 7), I could potentially navigate toward apples.\n\nBoth moves are somewhat constrained, but DOWN keeps me moving toward the apples at (6, 6) and (5, 5). The enemy will likely grab (6, 6) this turn if they go LEFT.\n\n**Strategy:** Go DOWN to work toward the lower apples. My tail will keep moving, opening up space.\n\nDOWN",

So at the moment of my move:\n- (7, 8), (7, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7) are all occupied.\n\nHmm, this seems like I'm completely trapped! Let me re-verify the board:\n\nLooking at the board representation:\nRow 7: `. . T . . T T 0 T T`\nPosition (7, 7) shows \"0\" which is my head.\nPosition (6, 7) shows \"T\" - body\nPosition (8, 7) shows \"T\" - body\nPosition (7, 8) shows \"T\" - body\nPosition (7, 6) shows \"T\" - body\n\nAll four directions are blocked by body segments!\n\nBut wait - tails will move this turn. My tail at (3, 5) isn't adjacent to me. Enemy tail at (9, 2) isn't adjacent either.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. The snake bodies listed show current positions. When I move, the entire snake shifts - the tail leaves its current position.\n\nLet me check if any adjacent cells will be vacated by tail movement:\n- (7, 8) is my body but not my tail\n- (6, 7) is my body but not my tail  \n- (7, 6) is enemy body but not enemy tail\n- (8, 7) is enemy body but not enemy tail\n\nNone of these are tails, so none will be vacated this turn!\n\nUnless... I misread something. Let me look again at the body lists:\nMy body ends at (3, 5) - that's my tail\nEnemy body ends at (9, 2) - that's their tail\n\nI appear to be completely surrounded! This is a death trap situation.\n\nWait - could there be an error? Let me count spaces on row 7:\n`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`. . T . . T T 0 T T`\n\nSo at y=7: positions 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 have T, position 7 has 0 (my head).\n\nHmm, actually if (8, 7) is enemy body that will shift... but it's not the tail.\n\nI'm trapped. Given that all moves appear fatal, I should pick one that at least has some chance or makes strategic sense. Let me try DOWN - if enemy moves away, (7, 6) might clear... but unlikely.\n\nDOWN",
