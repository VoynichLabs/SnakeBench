The enemy snake is at (2,9), far enough to not immediately threaten, but I must avoid potential head-on collisions\u2014remembering that if our heads end up in the same cell this turn or this turn, both die. No bodies yet, so no self-collision risks, and all four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are on-board and body-free, making them all immediately safe without obvious lethal traps. However, the game favors moves increasing access to apples safely while keeping future options open (e.g., avoiding corners or bottlenecks). Board state shows wide open space, with no tight areas nearby, so flexibility is high. Prioritizing: moving LEFT brings me toward the left-side apples ((1,3), (2,4), (0,6)) in a direction with more board room to maneuver, versus RIGHT (potential toward (8,6) but crossing toward a wall edge) or UP/DOWN (minimal apple proximity benefit and UP is already near board edge). If the enemy moves DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9), no shared spaces; if RIGHT to (3,9), still no collision with me left at (3,8). This keeps multiple future safe moves (up, down, left, perhaps even looping back right safely) while positioning for growth.\n\n**Future strategy note: Move east/west to flank apple clusters while staying spaced from the enemy\u2014prioritize heading down after repositioning to avoid top-board crowding, aiming for (4,0) or left-bottom cluster, then loop for safety entour if needed.**\n\nLEFT",

Invalid.\n2. **DOWN**: (1, 1) - Safe, but moves away from the closest apple at (2, 2).\n3. **LEFT**: (0, 2) - Safe, but moves away from the closest apple.\n4. **RIGHT**: (2, 2) - Safe, moves directly to the apple at (2, 2).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Moving RIGHT is the best option as it takes me directly to the apple at (2, 2).\n- Moving DOWN or LEFT would take me away from the closest apple, which is not optimal.\n- The enemy snake is not in a position to threaten me immediately, so I can focus on collecting the apple.\n\n**Best Move:**\nRIGHT is the best move because:\n1. It keeps me alive.\n2. It moves me directly to the closest apple at (2, 2).\n3.

Avoids LEFT (retrograde, no gain) or DOWN/UP (diverts from apple, opens south/north south dead-end potential). LEFT would be reversing, potentially risky if considered hitting self (though prior turn example suggests okay without body), but RIGHT keeps strategy intact.\n\nStrategy notes next turns: After eating (8,6) on turn 9 (grow to length 2, body (7,6)), move UP to (8,7) on turn 10\u2014scout for (8,8) apple via RIGHT to (9,7) then UP to (9,8) then LEFT, or LEFT to (7,7) etc. if space allows.
