That\u2019s pure CONTENT.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **POSITIONING** \u2192 (3,\u202f6) puts me one step closer to the (6,\u202f7) apple cluster and keeps my x\u2011coordinate moving right, opening up future routes toward the center of the board.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **NO IMMEDIATE DANGER** \u2192 opponent can\u2019t reach (3,\u202f6) in one turn, and I\u2019m not stepping into any body cell.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **FUTURE OPTIONS** \u2192 after this move my body will be at (2,\u202f6). I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, and RIGHT available next turn (LEFT is blocked). That\u2019s still plenty of flexibility.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF)**  \n- TURN\u202f1: RIGHT \u2192 snag (3,\u202f6) apple, grow to length\u202f2.  \n- TURN\u202f2: Aim for (4,\u202f6) \u2192 keep marching right toward the (6,\u202f7) apple line.  \n- TURN\u202f3\u20114: Snake up toward (6,\u202f7) to eat another apple, then start heading upward to raid the (6,\u202f9) and (9,\u202f8) clusters.  \n- Keep my head away from the opponent\u2019s head and body, and constantly force a head\u2011on collision when my score outruns theirs.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **BOTTOM LINE:** The only move that gives me an apple **and** keeps me safe is RIGHT.

Apples matter but enemy is the focus. \ud83d\udc80\n- Apple right below us at (8,5). Other apples are far away / near the enemy on the left side.\n- Possible moves (HEAD \u2192 that cell):\n  * UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 safe, keeps many options, no immediate apple.\n  * DOWN \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 apple! Eat and go up 1 point. Safe this turn.\n  * LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 moves toward enemy but both 0 apples now; head-on risk later if they mirror.\n  * RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 safe but hugs the wall, fewer long-term options.\n\nEliminate suicide moves: none of these immediately kill us. No bodies to run into and all moves are on-board.\n\nStrategic choice rationale:\n- We're tied 0\u20130. We should NOT gamble on a head-on right now (we'd both die and tie). If we take the apple DOWN, we become 1\u20130 \u2014 then we can be much more aggressive and even force risky head-on plays later to end the opponent.\n- DOWN gives immediate growth/score advantage and is safe this turn. Yes, it slightly reduces backward options next turn (we\u2019ll have a body segment at (8,6)), but we still have two good escape choices after eating. That's the power play: score first, threaten later. \u2705\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (for my next-rationale clip):\n- After eating at (8,5), use the 1-0 advantage to pressure the enemy\u2019s corridor. Move to control central lanes (target columns ~4\u20136) and prioritize apples that help box them. Force them into tight moves; if they close for a head-on while behind, accept it \u2014 we win. If they avoid, keep chipping apples and growing to crush mobility. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nYou know what we do \u2014 go steal that apple and make him sweat. Ready? Let's eat.\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP gets me to y=7 (matching an apple at (6,7)) but leaves me stuck at x=3, while moving DOWN heads away from the apple hot\u2011spot.  \n\n also, after a RIGHT move my new head will be at (4,6) and my body will occupy (3,6), leaving me with three viable follow\u2011up directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2013 no dead\u2011ends in sight.

Opponent head at (3,6) with body at (2,6). Apples are everywhere but we\u2019re focusing on boxing the rival, not snacks right this second.\n\nConsider the four moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8,6): immediate death \u2014 that\u2019s our own body directly behind us. NOPE. \ud83d\udc80\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4): safe, but drifts away from the fight and doesn\u2019t pressure the foe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5): safe but hugs the wall and limits future options \u2014 not aggressive enough.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5): safe and the most aggressive. Moves us toward the opponent and toward the board center where we can cut off lanes.\n\nKey tactical note: Opponent at (3,6) cannot move LEFT because their body is at (2,6) (that\u2019s their backward cell). That reduces their escape options on the next turn and makes westward aggression effective for forcing them into tighter choices. We\u2019re currently tied on apples \u2014 so we should NOT suicidal-head-on while tied. Moving LEFT starts to build positional pressure without immediately risking a double KO.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Push west to control columns ~5\u20136, use central lanes to cut off the enemy\u2019s access to open space.\n- If they try to retreat right/center, box them with coordinated lateral movement and pick apples that increase our length to reduce their mobility.\n- If we gain an apples lead, be willing to force a head-on if they try to collide \u2014 we\u2019ll accept it if we\u2019re ahead.\n\nLEFT",

NO WAY. \ud83d\udc80\n- Opponent head: (4,6), body at (3,6) \u2192 they CANNOT go LEFT (that\u2019s into their body). Their options next turn: RIGHT (5,6), UP (4,7), or DOWN (4,5).\n- Apples? Ignoring for now \u2014 we\u2019re boxing the foe. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udeab\n\nConsider the four moves from (7,5):\n- UP \u2192 (7,6): safe, keeps options, but doesn\u2019t pressure as directly.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4): safe but retreats from the fight \u2014 boring and passive.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5): ILLEGAL (backwards into our own body). Instant loss if chosen. NOPE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5): safe and aggressive \u2014 moves us toward the opponent and centralizes control of the board.\n\nTactical read: opponent can\u2019t go left, so pushing west (decreasing x) hurts their escape lanes. We\u2019re tied on apples (1\u20131), so we should NOT seek a risky head-on. Instead we must shrink their accessible space and force them into suboptimal moves (up or down into edges), then pounce. Moving LEFT keeps multiple follow-ups (we can then go up/down to cut or continue pressuring west) and doesn\u2019t walk into a trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to close horizontal distance and deny columns to the enemy.\n- Watch their response: if they go RIGHT (5,6) we pivot UP/LEFT to corner; if they go DOWN (4,5) we shift LEFT then DOWN to hem them toward the bottom; if they go UP, we follow and box from above.\n- Avoid head-on while tied; if we gain an apple lead, prepare to force a head-on on their next risky move.\n\nWe play aggressive but smart \u2014 close the net, don\u2019t throw the game.\n\nLEFT",

From (4,5) we can pivot UP next turn to threaten their tail if they move up or right, or swing left to cut them off if they try to flee west. We keep multiple follow-ups (UP/LEFT/DOWN) and avoid risky head-on plays while we\u2019re behind on apples.\n- Long-term: hem them into the west wall or force them into a bad escape into our longer-range control.

Who\u2019s ready to box this clown in?\n\nQuick board read (fast, loud):\n- Our head = (4,5). Neck/behind = (5,5) \u2192 RIGHT is BACKWARDS = insta-death. Don\u2019t even think about RIGHT. \ud83d\udc80\n- Opponent head = (5,8), body = (4,8), (4,7). They cannot move LEFT (that\u2019s into their neck at 4,8). Their options this turn: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), or RIGHT (6,8).\n- Apples don\u2019t matter for the moment \u2014 we\u2019re focusing on boxing the rival and avoiding a risky head-on since we\u2019re DOWN 1 apple (1 vs 2). We do NOT want to trade heads while behind.\n\nEvaluate our four moves:\n- RIGHT -> (5,5): illegal (into our neck). DEAD. \u274c\n- UP -> (4,6): safe. Directly under their column (x=4). Applies immediate vertical pressure. Keeps multiple follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/UP depending on how they move). Aggressive but controlled.\n- DOWN -> (4,4): safe but passive \u2014 gives them more breathing room to roam the top half.\n- LEFT -> (3,5): safe and lateral pressure \u2014 good for flanking, but slower to pin them vertically.\n\nHead-on risk check:\n- Opponent can\u2019t reach any of our candidate squares this turn (they\u2019re at y=8). No immediate head-on threat. We still should avoid forcing a head-on because we\u2019re behind on apples.\n\nDecision & short plan (long-term note for next rationale):\n- Go UP to (4,6). Why? Because it immediately pressures the x=4 column right beneath their body pieces at (4,7)/(4,8), setting up to hem them toward the right/top walls and reduce their escape routes. UP keeps multiple escape/follow-up options (LEFT to cut, RIGHT to pivot, or continue UP if they vacate). It\u2019s aggressive without committing to a risky head-on while we\u2019re down an apple.\n- Long-term plan: Continue compressing the opponent\u2019s space on the x=4/5 area. Avoid forcing head-on until we\u2019re ahead on apples. Lure them into moving right or down into our trap \u2014 then close the west exit with a cut (LEFT pivot) and force them into collisions or bad escapes. Grab apples opportunistically only when they help the trap or don\u2019t expose us to head-on trades.\n\nReady to make the pressure move \u2014 LET\u2019S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Think loud, move smart.\n\nQuick sanity check (do the steps):\n- Our head = (3,7). Neck = (4,7) \u2192 RIGHT is backwards into our neck = insta-death. DELETE RIGHT. \u274c\n- Opp head = (5,7) with body behind it at (6,7),(6,8),(5,8). Opponent cannot move into our neck safely if we vacate it, and they can\u2019t move RIGHT (that\u2019s their neck), so their likely choices are LEFT (4,7) or DOWN (5,6) \u2014 maybe UP if tail logic allowed, but that\u2019s unlikely.\n- Immediate dangerous squares for us: (4,7) is our neck (no), any occupied opponent body squares (5,7),(6,7),(6,8),(5,8). Don\u2019t walk into those.\n\nEvaluate legal moves from (3,7):\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7): safe, keeps lots of room, but drifts away from pressure.\n- UP \u2192 (3,8): safe, gains higher ground, helps hem them toward the top border and creates future angles to box their flank.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6): safe, more central, also OK.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7): forbidden (backwards).\n\nWhy UP:\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups open (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN later) and pushes us toward the opponent\u2019s top-side where they already have body segments \u2014 good for compressing their escape options.\n- Avoids any possible head-on (their reachable squares this turn are not (3,8)), and avoids stepping into occupied cells.\n- Preserves mobility \u2014 we won\u2019t get trapped immediately and can pivot next turn to cut them off or circle back left to squeeze their corridor.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (3,8) to gain the high lane.\n- Next turns: shadow their top corridor, aim to move rightward into the x=3\u20135 band while preventing them easy exits (pressure left/top). Don\u2019t bait a head-on while trailing apples; only force direct collisions when we have the advantage or a guaranteed trap.\n- Use growth opportunistically to block their escapes; force them toward the board edge and pin them against our body.\n\nLong-term intent:\n- Box them into a shrinking corridor (preferably along the top or right wall) and then close the gap. Stay alive, keep options open, and only trade heads when we\u2019re ahead or it\u2019s a guaranteed win.\n\nUP",

RIGHT is safe and aggressive: it keeps multiple follow-ups open (we can continue press or peel out), nudges us into the corridor that can shrink their space, and doesn't invite an immediate head-on while we're trailing.\n\nShort plan (next few turns): Keep pressuring across x=4\u20136 to compress their room. Avoid forcing a head-on while we have fewer apples \u2014 instead bait them toward the edge and only collide if we have the apple-advantage. Time growth to lock escape corridors and watch their tail vacates.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait\u2014currently we have 1 apple; taking (6,9) gives us +1 \u2192 we get to 2 apples, closing the gap vs their 3. Good.\n   - Mobility after UP: once at (6,9) we cannot go UP (off-board) and cannot go DOWN next turn (that would be into our neck), so our only follow-ups will be LEFT (5,9) or RIGHT (7,9). That reduces degrees of freedom compared to moving RIGHT now.\n   - RIGHT now keeps more immediate escape options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT later) but passes up a free apple that\u2019s unreachable by the opponent this turn.\n\nTactical read and plan:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (1 vs 3). Grabbing reachable apples when safe is priority to close gap and give us leverage.\n- Take (6,9) now \u2014 it\u2019s safe and denies the apple to the opponent.\n- After eating, pivot laterally (likely RIGHT) along the top row to try to box the enemy toward the center/left. For the next 2\u20133 turns, avoid forcing a head-on while we accumulate apples; if they reckless-charge us later while we\u2019re ahead, we can accept a head-on.\n\nFinal move (short and loud): UP\n\nUP",

Opponent head at (3,1) with a stacked body up at x=4 (y=2..6). They\u2019re low-left; we\u2019re high-middle. We\u2019re down on apples (2 vs 6) so NO dumb head-on unless we get the edge.\n\nMove analysis:\n- UP \u2192 (5,8) = neck \u2192 ILLEGAL. \u2716\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) = open. Keeps center control, decent escape options (6,8 / 7,7 / 6,6). Safe. \u2714\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) = open. Pushes toward enemy column x=4, starts pinning pressure. Becomes adjacent above their body at (4,6) \u2014 risky if we overcommit but good for zoning. \u2714\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6) = open. Keeps maximum mobility in the middle, safe and flexible. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nRisk assessment: Opponent is far; no immediate head-to-head. Because we\u2019re behind on apples, we shouldn\u2019t force a symmetric head-on. We want to increase board control and threaten to box them toward x=4 while keeping escape routes. LEFT to (4,7) begins that squeeze \u2014 it gives us leverage to cut off their vertical column and bait them upward into traps later, while still leaving multiple follow-up options (UP to 4,8, LEFT to 3,7, or stay mobile). RIGHT and DOWN are safer but slower for aggression.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT to threaten the x=4 lane and limit their downward mobility.\n- Next turns, if they drift up or right, collapse toward their neck/shoulder by rotating around x=4 while guarding escape to the center.\n- Avoid committing to a head-to-head while behind in apples; look to chase their tail when they overextend.\n\nLEFT",

Low immediate risk, high pressure reward. \ud83d\udd25\n\nShort-term plan (2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to put pressure on x=3\u20134 column.\n- If they drift up/right, rotate down to trap around x=3\u20134 and look for tail-chase opportunities.\n- Avoid committing to simultaneous head-on collisions while still behind on apples \u2014 force them into tight corridors and pick them off or win by attrition.\n\nWe\u2019re making the aggressive play \u2014 let\u2019s go box him in and bait a mistake.

Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 open. Keeps high ground, but slightly passive. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 open. Center-preserving, flexible for escape lanes. \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 open. Aggressive, closes horizontal gap toward enemy columns x=1\u20134. \u2705\n\nRisk check:\n- Opponent head at (1,1) \u2014 too far to threaten our adjacent cells this turn. No immediate head-on risk regardless of our choice.\n- Their body forms a vertical blockade around x=4 (y=2\u20134) and some coverage of x=3 at low y; they\u2019re cramped low-left. We want to squeeze that space without throwing our head into a two-way collision.\n\nTactical read / short-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (2,7) to start corralling along the x=2\u20134 band; this increases pressure and gives us a clear path to drop down on their flanks.\n- From (2,7) pivot DOWN to cut off their upward escape if they try to climb; keep options UP/DOWN/LEFT available so we don\u2019t get funneled.\n- Avoid rushing head-on \u2014 they have more apples. Force them into tight corridors and bait a mistake or chase their tail. If they overcommit toward us, we capitalize on their collisions with our body.\n\nWe\u2019re staying aggressive but not reckless \u2014 close the net, deny space, look for the tail-chase.

Neck: (1,6) \u2014 so LEFT into (1,6) is immediate backwards death. No thanks. \u274c\n\nAll 4 directions:\n- UP \u2192 (2,7): legal, but (1,7) is our tail so LEFT from there is blocked \u2014 UP reduces immediate escape options. Slightly restrictive.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,6): legal and keeps lots of open space. Good for flexibility and center control.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,5): legal, moves us closer to the enemy (they\u2019re at (0,4)). Helps start boxing them toward column 0 and pressures their apple choices. Keeps multiple follow-ups (left/right/down) open.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,6): illegal \u2014 into our neck/backwards death.

They\u2019re already confined along column 0\u20131, so we should begin nudging them toward the wall and cutting off escape lanes rather than chasing apples ourselves.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- It proactively closes vertical distance to the enemy (we\u2019re at y=6 vs their y=4), allowing a quick pivot to (1,5) next turn to threaten (0,5)/(1,4) options.  \n- Keeps 3 safe follow-ups from (2,5): LEFT (toward their side), RIGHT (retreat to center), DOWN (continue press). Flexible and aggressive without committing to a risky funnel.  \n- Avoids unnecessary head-on risk (we\u2019re behind on apples \u2014 don\u2019t force a simultaneous collision unless we can win it).\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- From (2,5) hit (1,5) to contest/box column 0 exits, bait them into (0,5) or (1,4), then seal their lateral escape. If they overcommit, force a trap or force them into a collision on their head into our body. Grow opportunistically, but prioritize boxing and survival.

They have 8 apples vs our 2 \u2014 we CANNOT risk a simultaneous head-on that could kill us (they\u2019d win the apple count). Avoid opening a direct head-on possibility.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4): legal and aggressive \u2014 moves toward the enemy column. But it commits us into a tighter area and could let them bait us into trading apples or pulling us into risky head-on lines near (1,4). Risky when behind on apples.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5): legal and CLEAN. Keeps the center, preserves the most follow-up options (UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT next turn), avoids giving them an easy head-on target, and lets us pressure later from a safer angle.\n\nOpponent intentions:\n- If they go RIGHT to (1,5) we must NOT go LEFT into (1,5) this turn (would be potential head-on). If they go UP to (0,6), they\u2019re trying to wiggle out \u2014 maintain center control and close later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move to the safer center (RIGHT) to preserve mobility and avoid giving them a head-on shot.\n- From there, shadow and shrink their escape space: bait them toward column 0 by cycling around the center, then slide left when we can force them into a trapped flow (only force head-on if we have more apples).\n- Take apples opportunistically when safe; prioritize boxing and survival over greedy apple grabs while trailing in score.\n\nFinal move (locking it in):\nRIGHT",

Neck: (2,5) \u2192 LEFT is directly backwards into our neck (illegal). \u274c\n- Opponent head: (0,6) with a long column on x=0 and a tail stretching to (3,1).

Shadow their likely RIGHT/UP escape from the wall, then start compressing their horizontal wiggle room. Only commit to a leftward trap when we can safely cut their exits without risking a simultaneous head-on.\n\nAlright chat \u2014 lock it in and keep them boxed.

Who wants smoke? \ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick safety sweep (thinking loud for the viewers):\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5): illegal \u2014 that's into our neck (we'd hit ourselves). No thanks. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (5,6): safe. Keeps vertical options and stays central. \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4): safe. Moves toward lower center, still flexible. \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5): safe AND lands on an apple (6,5) \u2014 we grow and gain an extra apple. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nBoard & enemy read: Opponent #0 is stapled to the left wall (head at 0,8; body down column x=0 and across at y=1). They can wiggle up to (0,9) or start sliding right to (1,8) next turn, but they\u2019re not in range for any immediate head-on with us. We're behind on apples (2 vs 10), so we CANNOT bait a reckless head-on. We want to squeeze them over time and seize center control.\n\nWhy RIGHT? Short, ruthless reasoning:\n- Grabbing (6,5) grows us and extends our barrier into the center \u2014 more body = more leverage to cut routes later. \ud83d\udcaa\n- Staying central-right denies them horizontal space when they try to peel off the wall, and gives us flexible follow-ups (up/down/right) next turn. Multiple safe options = surviving and setting traps.\n- No immediate collision risk from the opponent this turn \u2014 so take the apple and force them to react to us, not the other way around.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Grow into the center and keep lateral pressure \u2014 use our additional length to pin their escape lanes if they tries to push right from the wall.\n- Avoid risking simultaneous head-on until we close the apple gap. Force them into tighter corridors and pick the moment to corral them when they have fewer safe steps.\n- Preserve at least 2 follow-up moves each turn; don\u2019t get funneled into single-file lanes near the borders.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE \u2018EM CRASH \u2014 now lock it in.\n\nRIGHT",

From there the only safe follow\u2011up is RIGHT, leaving us with a single option and risking a dead\u2011end.  \n- **RIGHT** moves us to (1,8). That keeps UP, RIGHT, and DOWN viable next turn, so we stay flexible and still land next to the (1,9) apple.  \n- Both moves are currently safe, but RIGHT preserves multiple escape routes and keeps pressure on the enemy.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Let\u2019s go for the flexible play and keep the pressure on!\n\nRIGHT",

All three (UP/DOWN/LEFT) are safe this turn.\n\nTactical choice reasoning (short-term):\n- We need apples fast to close the 5-apple gap. Both UP and DOWN are immediate apples. LEFT gives space but no apple.\n- DOWN to (6,1) gives an immediate apple and opens a sweet chain: (5,1),(4,1),(3,1) are apples too \u2014 we can sweep left along y=1 to rack points and stay flexible.\n- That bottom lane gives multiple escape options (continue left, drop to y=0 for apples at (5,0)/(2,0), or swing back up through the middle). UP also grabs an apple at (6,3) but pushes us into a denser cluster near our own body on the right and the opponent zone above \u2014 slightly riskier for being corralled in a few moves.\n- We must avoid forcing a head-on; opponent isn\u2019t close enough to threaten that, so prioritize growth and board control.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat DOWN to (6,1), then chain LEFT across row y=1 to pick off (5,1),(4,1),(3,1). After that pivot into the middle to pick (5,3)/(4,3) cluster or drop to the bottom apples at (5,0)/(2,0) depending on opponent movement.\n- Keep lanes open to the left and down so we don\u2019t get boxed by our own body. If the enemy starts descending, consider cutting them off only if we have a clear head-on advantage (we don\u2019t yet).\n\nDecision: TAKE THE BOTTOM APPLE \u2014 secure points, keep options open, and start the left sweep.\n\nDOWN",

That will be the fastest way to close the 5-apple gap and gain board control on the lower rows.\n- DOWN gives space but wastes an apple opportunity and slows the score catch-up.\n- RIGHT is passive and funnels toward our own midbody; not ideal for aggression.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- LEFT to eat (5,1), then keep moving LEFT to clear (4,1) and (3,1). After that pivot into row 0 for (5,0)/(2,0) or up into the middle apple clusters depending on how the rival moves.\n- Stay aware if the opponent drops south quickly \u2014 if they approach for a head-on and we still trail in apples, avoid direct head-on.

The board is ripe, apples are scattered, and I\u2019m itching to box that opponent into a corner.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all clear of my own body and the enemy\u2019s current cells.

Upward from there would run into my own body at (7,8), so that path closes off quickly.  \n- DOWN drops me to (8,6). Upward from there would also hit my own tail, limiting flexibility.  \n\nThus RIGHT seems the smartest: it grabs me a spot right under a free apple, keeps three viable follow\u2011up moves, and leaves the enemy nowhere near a head\u2011on collision this turn.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Plan:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Grab the (9,8) apple next turn.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the extra length to herd snake #1 toward the left edge.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep my tail expanding to block escape routes.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Stay alert for any chance of a double\u2011KO \u2013 with 14 vs 9 apples, a mutual death clinches the win.  \n\nWhat\u2019s the move?  \n\nRIGHT",

We need apples and board control fast. LEFT to (4,1) grabs an apple immediately and continues the bottom-left sweep: next turn we can hit (3,1) then pivot to row 0 apples like (2,0) or (5,0) as needed. That sequence gives high apple pickup rate while keeping many escape options across the lower rows.\n- DOWN to (5,0) also picks an apple but tends to funnel us along the bottom edge sooner and gives slightly fewer branching options than sweeping left first.\n- UP doesn\u2019t grab an apple and wastes momentum; only use if we need to escape a trap (not the case now).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- LEFT to (4,1) now (eat), then LEFT to (3,1) (eat), then decide between sweeping row 0 for (2,0)/(5,0) or turning north into central apples depending on how the rival moves. Avoid forcing head-on unless we manage to flip the score lead.\n\nFinal call \u2014 take the apple, keep options open, and maintain pressure. LET\u2019S GO!\n\nLEFT",

We need to close fast by collecting high-value, low-risk apples while keeping escape options open.\n- LEFT to (3,1) immediately eats an apple (growth + points) and continues our sweep of the lower-left area. From (3,1) we can follow up with (2,1) then drop to (2,0) to nab another apple, or pivot up toward central apples if the rival drifts down.\n- UP or DOWN are safe but slower and either hugs the wall (riskier) or gives fewer immediate apples. No nearby opponent head threats this turn \u2014 avoid unnecessary head-on gambles since they still lead.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Grab (3,1) now. Then prioritize (2,0) and (5,0)/(2,0) sequence depending on how the rival moves. Keep lateral mobility across rows 0\u20132 to avoid getting boxed by the big top snake. Only force a head-on if we flip the score lead.\n\nLEFT",

Don\u2019t back into ourselves. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,3) is an apple. Grabs +1 and keeps multiple exits (up/left/down) \u2014 solid and safe. \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,3) is also an apple and opens a chain (4,3 \u2192 5,3 \u2192 6,3). That chain can net us multiple apples quickly to close the 13\u219215 gap. Aggressive and high-reward, but will momentarily freeze our tail while we grow, so we must plan escape routes. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4f\n- UP \u2192 (3,4) is safe and conservative, keeps lots of room, but misses an immediate apple. Good for mobility, not as aggressive. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nRisk check vs opponent (head at 7,9): they\u2019re far up top \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn. The bigger danger is us getting boxed by our own eastern body if we blindly hug the right wall. We MUST keep at least two escape options after eating apples.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning RIGHT: we\u2019re down by 2 apples. The corridor at y=3 (4,3 / 5,3 / 6,3) is a golden streak \u2014 chain-eating here can swing the score quickly and force the other snake to take risks or try a head-on when we\u2019re ahead. We have room to take 2\u20133 apples and then pivot up/left before the east-side body traps us. That\u2019s aggression + options if we plan the exit. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4a\n\nShort-term plan (to appear as next-turn rationale):\n- Take the apple at (4,3) this turn, then follow the apple chain at (5,3) and (6,3) to jump the score.\n- After collecting 1\u20133 apples, pivot UP and then LEFT to avoid getting boxed by our own eastern body; keep at least two escape directions each move.\n- If we surpass them and they close for a head-on, we force it \u2014 we want that KO when we\u2019re ahead. \ud83d\udca5\n\nLet\u2019s cash in on that apple streak and swing the scoreboard.

Could get cramped if we grow here. \ud83c\udfaf\u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (5,4) = apple. Keeps multiple exits (LEFT, UP, RIGHT available next turn), lets us chain into (5,5) or swing to (6,4).

Quick, sharp read before we hit it.\n\nCheck all 4 from head (5,4):\n- UP \u2192 (5,5): apple, open space, gives us 2\u20133 follow-up exits (up/left/right). Safe and keeps options. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4): apple, but (7,4) is our own body right beyond it \u2014 that blocks a key escape and squeezes us into a narrower corridor. Riskier. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4): empty and legal, but fewer clear exits than UP and less immediate gain. Could be fine for maneuvering but less value. \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3): immediate neck (our body) \u2014 ILLEGAL. Don't be that guy. \ud83d\udeab\n\nOpponent is way up at y=9 with a big top-side coil \u2014 no immediate head-on threat this turn. We lead 16\u201315, so we should avoid gambling a risky positional trade; instead take safe content while maximizing future options.\n\nDecision: Go UP to (5,5). It grabs an apple, preserves mobility (multiple exits), and keeps us flexible to either expand toward the center or pivot around the enemy later. Controlled aggression \u2014 grab content, keep lanes open, then force the duel on our terms.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- After UP, keep moving to control the central band (use (5,6) or swing to (6,5)/(4,5) as needed) to avoid being funneled east.\n- If the opponent drifts down toward center, bait a head-on only if they commit and we still hold the apple lead.\n- Avoid pushing into the x\u22656 corridor unless we can loop out; prioritize space over immediate extra apples.\n\nUP",
