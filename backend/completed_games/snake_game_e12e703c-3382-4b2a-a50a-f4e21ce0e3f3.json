The apple at (7,6) is directly below and slightly left; the apple at (9,4) is farther down and right.\n- Since we're at (8,7), moving RIGHT would go to (9,7).\n- Moving DOWN from (8,7) would go to (8,6), which gets us closer vertically.\n- Moving LEFT would go to (7,7), which is occupied by our body \u2014 so it's a collision.\n- Moving UP from (8,7) would go to (8,8).\n\nCheck for collisions and safety:\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,7): \n  - Is (9,7) within bounds?

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- Our snake's head is at (8,7), with body at [(7,7)]. Since we moved down previously, now our head is at (8,7). Wait, according to the move record, our last move was DOWN, so our new head should be at (8,6). Let's clarify the current position:\n\nGiven the last move was DOWN:\n- Our previous head was at (8,7).\n- Moving DOWN brings us to (8,6).\n\nSo, our current head is at (8,6), with body at [(7,7)] (as per the past data). But the last move indicates the head is at (8,6). The previous body position was at (7,7), which is now behind us.\n\nNow, our goal is to reach an apple as efficiently as possible, preferably the one at (7,6), which is directly to the left of our current position.\n\nCheck surroundings:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6): Is it safe?\n  - Cell at (7,6): Is there an obstacle?\n  - The enemy snake at (7,7), body at [(7,7), (7,6)]? No, the enemy's head is at (7,8) with body at [(7,7), (7,6)]. Their body is at (7,7) and (7,6).\n\nSo, at (7,6), there's an enemy body segment.\n\nOur own body is at (7,7), so moving LEFT into (7,6) would cause a collision with the enemy's body segment.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is unsafe.\n\nNext options:\n\n- Moving UP to (8,7):\n  - (8,7): Empty\n  - Is safe, but moving UP would take us away from the target apple at (7,6)? Yes, that would increase distance.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,6):\n  - (9,6): Empty\n  - Moving right doesn't bring us closer to the apple at (7,6).\n\n- Moving DOWN to (8,5):\n  - Cell (8,5): Empty\n  - Moving down away from the goal, and possibly risky if dead-end or enemy nearby. But no immediate threat nearby indicates it's safe.\n\nNext, carefully considering the best move:\n\nOur priority is to reach the apple at (7,6). To do that safely:\n\n- Moving LEFT (to (7,6)) is impossible, as the cell is occupied by enemy's body.\n- Moving UP (to (8,7)) is safe, but doesn't progress toward the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT (to (9,6)) is safe, but also doesn't help with the current goal.\n- Moving DOWN (to (8,5)) is safe, but takes us away from the apple.\n\nAlternative strategy:\n\nSince the apple at (7,6) is directly left of our current position at (8,6), and LEFT is blocked, perhaps better to look for a different apple or plan a safe route toward future apples.\n\nOther apples:\n- (2,5): far away to the left.\n- (9,4): to the right and below.\n- (5,4): to the left and down.\n- (1,2): far to the left and down.\n- (6,7): to the left and above.\n\nThe nearest safe apple to reach directly is possibly (9,4), which is to the right at (9,4). Moving right from (8,6) to (9,6), then down to (9,4) could be an option.\n\nCheck that route:\n\n- From (8,6), moving RIGHT to (9,6): safe.\n- Next, moving DOWN to (9,4): at (9,4), which is Apple, safe and beneficial.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (9,6).\n2. Next move, move DOWN to (9,4) to eat apple.\n\nIn the immediate next move:\n\n- Moving RIGHT is safe.\n- Moving UP or DOWN towards the apple is possible but less direct.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be:\n\n**RIGHT**\n\nNext turn, I will plan to go down to (9,4).\n\n---\n\n**Next move: RIGHT**"
