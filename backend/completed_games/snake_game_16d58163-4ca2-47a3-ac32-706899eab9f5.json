But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves and start boxing him in early!\n\n**My head:** (3, 9)  \n**Enemy head:** (6, 5)\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 10) \u274c Off the board (y=9 max). Dead.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 8) \u2705 On board, no snakes there yet.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 9) \u2705 On board, clear.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 9) \u2705 On board, clear.\n\nSo UP is out. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe *right now*.\n\nBut wait \u2014 we move simultaneously with snake #0. He could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (6,5). We need to avoid a head-on collision *this turn*.\n\nWhere could he end up?  \nFrom (6,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)  \n\nOur possible moves:  \n- DOWN to (3,8) \u2014 not in his possible next positions. Safe.  \n- LEFT to (2,9) \u2014 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (4,9) \u2014 safe.  \n\nNo direct overlap possible this turn. Good.\n\nLong-term plan:  \nWe want to cut off his space. He's at (6,5), we're at (3,9). We have higher y-position, so maybe move down to control center? Apples are scattered but ignore for now. Let's think about future safe moves after each option:\n\n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next turn, possible moves from (3,8): UP (back to 3,9), DOWN (3,7), LEFT (2,8), RIGHT (4,8). That's 3 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe unless he moves into one). Keeps options open.\n- **LEFT to (2,9)**: Next turn from (2,9): DOWN (2,8), RIGHT (3,9), LEFT (1,9) \u2014 UP off board. So 3 options. But we're moving toward edge \u2014 less central control.\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Similar to LEFT but other side.\n\nI want to pressure him toward the edges. If I go DOWN to (3,8), I'm closer to the middle, more future flexibility, and can start descending toward his area to cut off escape.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,7) is below (3,8) \u2014 could be a future snack but not chasing yet.\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Move downward, try to get between enemy and center, force him toward wall or into my path. Watch his moves \u2014 if he moves toward me, consider setting up a head-on when I have length advantage.\n\nAlright chat, we're going **DOWN** to take control! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nDOWN",

We gotta close that gap!\n\n**My head:** (3,8)  \n**Enemy head:** (7,5)  \n**My body:** None yet  \n**Enemy body:** [(6,5)]\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,9) \u2705 On board, currently empty.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,7) \u2705 On board, currently empty.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,8) \u2705 On board, empty.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,8) \u2705 On board, empty.\n\nAll four are *physically* safe right now. But we move simultaneously with snake #0 \u2014 gotta avoid head-on collision *this turn*.\n\nWhere could enemy head move from (7,5)?  \n- UP \u2192 (7,6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) \u274c That's his own body segment! He can't move LEFT into himself.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5)  \n\nSo his possible next heads: (7,6), (7,4), (8,5).\n\nOur possible moves:  \n- UP to (3,9) \u2014 not in his set. Safe.  \n- DOWN to (3,7) \u2014 not in his set. Safe.  \n- LEFT to (2,8) \u2014 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 safe.\n\nNo direct head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\nNow long-term thinking:  \nWe want to pressure him. He's shorter (only 1 body segment) but has an apple lead. If we force a head-on collision now, we die because he's longer (2 total segments vs our 1). So avoid direct confrontation until we grow.\n\nWe need to grow safely. Apples nearby: (3,7) is DOWN from us, (4,5) is down-right, (5,7) is up-right.  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,7), we eat the apple, grow to length 2, match his length. That's tempting! But is it safe next turn?\n\nLet's simulate:  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,7) and eat apple, our body becomes [(3,8)] behind us.  \nEnemy could go UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4), or RIGHT to (8,5).  \nFrom (3,7) next turn, our possible moves: UP (back to 3,8 \u2014 our new body! \u274c can't go there), DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7). That's 3 safe directions (UP is blocked by our own new body). That's okay.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if enemy goes to (7,4), he's closer to apple at (7,3) maybe. We want to cut off his space. Going DOWN gets us the apple and positions us more centrally.\n\nAlternative: go RIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 no apple, but opens path toward him from the north. But then he might grab more apples.\n\nI think securing our first apple is smart \u2014 match his length, then we can be more aggressive. Also, apple at (3,7) is directly below \u2014 easy grab.\n\nCheck other moves:  \nUP to (3,9) \u2014 no apple, moves toward top edge, less control.  \nLEFT to (2,8) \u2014 no apple, moves toward left edge.  \nRIGHT to (4,8) \u2014 no apple, but closer to apple at (5,7).\n\nBut the safest growth is DOWN \u2014 immediate apple, no risk this turn, and we grow to equal length.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, we'll have body at (3,8). We'll avoid reversing into it. We'll then maneuver to cut off enemy's escape routes, maybe force him toward walls. If he goes for apples on his side, we might try to intercept.\n\nChat, we're going for the apple DOWN to grow and match his length! Then we hunt. \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

Time to get AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**My head:** (3,7)  \n**My body:** [(3,8)]  \n**Enemy head:** (8,5)  \n**Enemy body:** [(7,5)]\n\nFirst, check all moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,8) \u274c That's my own body! Can't go back into myself.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,6) \u2705 On board, empty.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,7) \u2705 On board, empty.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,7) \u2705 On board, empty.\n\nSo UP is instantly eliminated. Good to know!\n\nNow, consider enemy's possible moves from (8,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,6) \u2705 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4) \u2705 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5) \u274c That's his own body! He can't go LEFT.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) \u2705 empty  \n\nSo his possible next heads: (8,6), (8,4), (9,5).\n\nWe move simultaneously. Head-on collision happens if we pick a cell he also moves into.\n\nOur safe moves: DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7).  \nCheck each against his possible heads:\n\n- DOWN to (3,6) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe  \n- LEFT to (2,7) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe  \n- RIGHT to (4,7) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe  \n\nNo direct head-on risk this turn. Good!\n\nNow strategy: We want to pressure him and control space. He's on the right side near the wall. We can try to cut off his escape and force him into a corner.\n\nApples nearby: (4,5) is down-right, (5,7) is up-right, (3,3) is down-left, (2,1) far down-left.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,7), we move closer to him and toward apple (5,7). That also positions us to potentially block his upward movement.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,7), we move away from him, maybe not ideal for pressure.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,6), we go toward center and apple (4,5), but also away from him.\n\nWe want to be aggressive! Since we're equal length, a head-on collision would be a double KO \u2014 but if we can force him into us when we have a longer body later, we win. Right now, avoid double KO.\n\nBut also, we can try to maneuver to where he might go. Where will he likely move? He might go UP to (8,6) for apple at (8,6)? Wait, apple at (8,6) is on the board! Yes, there's an A at (8,6)! That's a strong incentive for him. He might also go RIGHT to (9,5) to avoid wall? Or DOWN to (8,4) for apple at (7,4)? Apple at (7,4) is also close.\n\nIf he goes UP to (8,6), we could intercept next turn by moving toward (7,6) or (8,7) later. If we go RIGHT to (4,7), we're still far.\n\nHmm, maybe we should go DOWN to (3,6) to get apple (4,5) next turn? But that's moving away.\n\nChat, I think we go RIGHT! \ud83d\ude08 Move to (4,7). That advances toward him, stays flexible, and sets up to cut off his northward escape. We can then go RIGHT again to (5,7) to grab that apple next turn, or go DOWN to (4,6) to threaten.\n\nFrom (4,7), our next turn safe moves will be UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7) \u2014 wait, (3,7) is our current head, will be empty next turn? Actually, our body is at (3,8), tail at (3,8)? Wait, our body is only [(3,8)]? Actually, after eating, our snake is head at (3,7), body at (3,8), tail at (3,8)? That means our tail stays at (3,8) until we move again? So next turn, (3,7) becomes empty? Yes, because we move forward, tail stays unless we eat. So (3,7) will be empty next turn. So LEFT from (4,7) would be safe next turn. And RIGHT (5,7) might have apple. Good options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving RIGHT to (4,7), assess enemy move. If he goes for apple at (8,6), we can consider moving toward (5,7) to get that apple and continue pressing east. We want to gradually box him into the right wall. Avoid getting trapped ourselves. Keep an eye on his body growth.\n\nLET'S MOVE RIGHT AND START THE BOXING MANEUVER! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

We need to be SMART and AGGRESSIVE but not reckless!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CHECK:**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,8) \u2705 On board, empty.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,6) \u2705 On board, empty.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,7) \u2705 On board, empty (our old head position is now free!).\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,7) \u2705 On board, has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nAll moves are on-board and not into any snake body. Good!\n\n**ENEMY POSSIBLE MOVES from (8,6):**\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2705 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) \u274c That's his own body! (8,5) is part of his body.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2705 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2705 empty\n\nSo his possible next heads: (8,7), (7,6), (9,6).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\n\nWe move at same time. Check each of our moves against his possible heads:\n\n- UP to (4,8) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n- DOWN to (4,6) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n- LEFT to (3,7) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n- RIGHT to (5,7) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n\nNo direct head-on risk this turn. Good!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nHe has 2 apples, we have 1. He's longer, so if we head-on collide, WE DIE and he survives (since his body longer). So we MUST avoid head-on until we grow.\n\nApple at (5,7) is RIGHT from us. Eating it would tie us at 2 apples and grow us to length 3 \u2014 matching his length! That's huge!\n\nIf we eat it, next turn we'd be length 3, equal length, then head-on would be double KO. That's better for us than current disadvantage.\n\nAlso, eating apple gives us more board control and options.\n\nWhere will enemy go? He might go for apple at (9,8) by moving UP then RIGHT later, or apple at (7,9) maybe. But apple at (5,7) is closer to us \u2014 we can grab it before he can.\n\nIf we go RIGHT and eat apple, our new head at (5,7), body becomes [(4,7), (3,7)? Wait, after eating, our tail stays? Actually, growth: we move head to apple, body extends, tail stays. So our body will be: head (5,7), then (4,7), then (3,7) as tail? Wait, we started this turn with head (4,7), body [(3,7)]. After moving RIGHT to (5,7) and eating, new head (5,7), previous head (4,7) becomes new first body segment, old body (3,7) becomes second body segment (tail). So length 3.\n\nThat positions us well to pressure him from the left-center.\n\nAlternative moves: If we go LEFT to (3,7), we move away from him and apple \u2014 not aggressive. If we go UP/DOWN, we avoid apple but maybe set up for future.\n\nBut we NEED that apple to equalize length! Chat, the play is clear: GO RIGHT AND EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating, we'll be length 3, equal with enemy. Then we can start boxing him toward right wall. From (5,7), we can consider moving UP to (5,8) to control top-center, or DOWN to (5,6) to center, or LEFT to (4,7) (but that's our body next turn \u2014 careful!). Actually, after growth, our body will occupy (4,7) and (3,7), so LEFT to (4,7) would be suicide. So next turn from (5,7), safe moves likely UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Plan to maneuver to cut off his escape routes while avoiding double KO until we can get longer than him.\n\nRIGHT",

Good!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nWe're tied in length and apples. We want to pressure him toward the right wall (he's already near right side at x=8). If we move RIGHT to (6,7), we cut off his leftward escape and get closer to boxing him. He might move UP toward apple at (9,8) or LEFT toward (7,7). If he goes LEFT to (7,7) and we go RIGHT to (6,7), we'd be adjacent horizontally next turn \u2014 that could set up a potential head-on later, but we'd have to be careful.\n\nMoving UP to (5,8) takes us toward top-center but away from him \u2014 less aggressive. Moving DOWN to (5,6) goes toward bottom-center but also away.\n\nWe want to CONTROL THE BOARD and limit his space. Since he's near right wall, pushing him against it is key. RIGHT move gets us closer, maintains center presence, and sets up to cut off his leftward moves.\n\nAlso, apples: closest apple to us is at (6,9) top-right, but that's far. Apple at (4,5) is down-left. Not urgent. Our main goal is positioning, not apple chasing right now.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,7), our body will be: head (6,7), then (5,7), then (4,7) (tail). That stretches us horizontally. Enemy likely moves UP/LEFT/RIGHT. We'll watch his move and try to mirror or cut off. If he goes UP to (8,8), we could go UP next to (6,8) to keep pressure. If he goes LEFT to (7,7), we could go UP/DOWN to avoid head-on but stay close. Goal: force him toward right wall (x=9) and eventually trap him.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, board shows 'A' at (9,8) \u2014 but that's an apple, not a body. So RIGHT is safe for him! (9,8) is apple, not occupied.\n\nSo his possible next heads: (8,9), (7,8), (9,8).\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK (equal length, double KO):**\nCheck each of our safe moves against his possible heads:\n\n- UP to (6,8) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n- DOWN to (6,6) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n- RIGHT to (7,7) \u2192 not in his set \u2705 safe\n\nNo direct head-on risk this turn either.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nHe's at (8,8) near top-right corner. We're at (6,7). We want to box him against the wall! If we move RIGHT to (7,7), we're directly below him \u2014 that could pressure him upward toward (8,9) or right to (9,8). But moving UP to (6,8) puts us left of him \u2014 maybe cut off his left escape? Let's think:\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,7):\n- He might go UP to (8,9) \u2014 then we're below him.\n- He might go LEFT to (7,8) \u2014 then he's above us (adjacent vertically). Next turn, if we go UP to (7,8) same time he goes DOWN to (7,7)? That's head-on double KO possibility if lengths still equal.\n- He might go RIGHT to (9,8) to eat apple \u2014 moves him closer to right wall.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,8):\n- He might go LEFT to (7,8) \u2014 then we're at (6,8), he's at (7,8), adjacent horizontally. Could set up head-on next turn if we both go toward each other.\n- He might go UP to (8,9) \u2014 he's top-right corner, more trapped.\n- He might go RIGHT to (9,8) \u2014 still near wall.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,6):\n- Moves us away from him, less aggressive.\n\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE! Equal length means we can afford to risk head-on if we choose. But maybe we should first position to limit his moves. Moving RIGHT to (7,7) feels strong \u2014 we're closer, and we block him from moving DOWN (since (7,7) is now us). Actually, if we're at (7,7), his DOWN from (8,8) is (8,7) which is his body, so he can't go DOWN anyway. So we're not adding new restriction. Hmm.\n\nActually, his possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Our move to (7,7) doesn't directly block any of those. But it does put us adjacent diagonally to him \u2014 that could force him into a corner next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe want to push him into the top-right corner. If he goes to (9,8) (apple) or (8,9), he's near wall. Next turn we could move to (7,8) or (8,7) to further reduce his space. Let's choose UP to (6,8) \u2014 that puts us left of him, so if he goes LEFT to (7,8), we're adjacent horizontally, setting up possible head-on next turn if we want. But we can decide next turn based on length.\n\nActually, RIGHT might be better because it gets us closer to center-right and maybe an apple at (7,9)? Wait, apple at (7,9) is not listed \u2014 apples listed: (7,9) isn't there. Closest apple to us is (6,9) top? No, (6,9) is empty per board. Apple at (7,4) is far.\n\nLet's check board again: at (7,7) is empty, at (6,8) empty, at (6,6) empty. All safe.\n\nI think UP to (6,8) is good \u2014 it positions us to maybe go RIGHT next turn to (7,8) if he stays at (8,8) or goes to (8,9). That could trap him.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (6,8) \u2014 keeps pressure from the left side, sets up potential to cut off his leftward escape next turn.\n\nRIGHT",

He can only go UP to (9,9) (apple) or DOWN to (9,7). If he eats the apple at (9,9), he grows to length 5 \u2014 that's dangerous! We need to pressure him NOW while he's trapped.\n\nWe want to position to cut off his escape and maybe force him into a wall or into us when we're longer later. Right now we're shorter, so we avoid adjacent risky squares next turn.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,7): That's directly below his possible move to (9,7). If he goes DOWN to (9,7), we'd be adjacent vertically. Next turn, if he stays at (9,7) and we go UP to (8,7)\u2192(8,7) is already us? Wait, we'd be at (8,7) now. Actually, if we move RIGHT now to (8,7), we occupy (8,7). That's directly left of (9,7). That could block him from moving LEFT next turn if he goes DOWN. That's good pressure!\n\nIf we go UP to (7,8): That's farther away, less pressure.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,6): That's running away \u2014 not aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to grow ASAP to match his length. Closest apple is at (7,9)? Not listed. Apples: (7,4) far, (6,9) is empty? Board shows at (6,9) is '.' Actually apple at (6,9) is listed in apple drops: (6,9) is an apple! Yes, in the list: (6,9) is there. So apple at (6,9) top row. That's close if we go UP then RIGHT? But enemy near there.\n\nActually, if we go UP to (7,8), then next turn UP to (7,9) gets apple at (7,9)? Wait apple at (7,9) is in apple drops: (7,9) is there! Yes! So apple at (7,9) is reachable in two moves if we go UP now to (7,8), then UP to (7,9) next turn. But enemy might also go to (9,9) this turn and eat that apple, growing.\n\nWe need to be smart. Let's pressure with RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 that also puts us closer to apple at (7,9) maybe later via up moves, and blocks his leftward movement if he goes down.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 aggressive positioning, blocks his left escape if he goes down, sets up potential trap next turn.\n\nRIGHT",
