No apples on the board in front of me yet, but we gotta set up the board control early.\n\n**TURN 0 ANALYSIS:**\nMy head is at (7,2). Snake #0 is at (9,5). The apples are scattered, but look at that board...\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . A\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n 7 . . A . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . . .

A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**ELIMINATING BAD MOVES:**\n- **UP** to (7,3): Safe (empty), but moves me toward the center cluster.\n- **DOWN** to (7,1): SAFE! There's an apple at (6,1) below me? Wait no, (7,1) is empty and clear. This opens up the bottom-left area.\n- **LEFT** to (6,2): **DANGER!** There's an apple at (6,2) but wait... looking at the board, (6,2) has an 'A' on it! But moving LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2) is valid, but let me check the snake bodies...\n- **RIGHT** to (8,2): Safe, but closer to enemy territory.\n\nWait, checking (6,2) on the board - row 2 shows: `A . . . . . A 1 . .` - so positions: (0,2)=A, (1,2)=., (2,2)=., (3,2)=., (4,2)=., (5,2)=., (6,2)=A, (7,2)=1, (8,2)=., (9,2)=.\n\nSo moving LEFT to (6,2) would eat an apple! That's +1 point! But is it safe from the enemy? Snake #0 is at (9,5), which is far away. Moving left is safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nWe need to dominate the board and trap enemy #0. The enemy is at (9,5) - top right corner area. I'm at (7,2) - bottom right area. \n\nBest move: **LEFT to (6,2)** - eat the apple immediately! This gives us the first point and grows our body. We need that advantage to force head-on collisions later. Plus, moving left positions us better to control the left side of the board while the enemy is stuck in the right corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nEstablish board control by eating available apples while boxing enemy into the right side. Use our length advantage to cut off escape routes. Force confrontation when we have the size advantage.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,2) for the apple! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is at (9,4) - they're shifting down slightly. Board is filled with apples but we need to focus on controlling space.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy is at (9,4) - right side, close to apples but also close to the wall.\n- I'm at (6,2) with body at (7,2). Need to avoid my own tail soon.\n- **IMMEDIATE DANGER:** If I go RIGHT back to (7,2), I'd hit my own tail (which moved from (7,2) to (7,3) or similar? Wait no, snake #0 moved simultaneously last turn. Actually need to think carefully...\n\n**CALCULATING SAFE MOVES:**\nLet's trace what happened last turn:\n1. I moved LEFT from (7,2) to (6,2) and ate apple\n2. Snake #0 was at (9,5), moved DOWN to (9,4)\n3. My tail (7,2) - since I didn't eat, my tail moves forward? Wait, I DID eat! I grew! So my tail stays at (7,2) while my new head is at (6,2). Actually NO - the rules: when you eat, you GROW, meaning your tail doesn't move! So my body is now: HEAD (6,2), BODY [(7,2)] - exactly as shown in the update.\n\n**MOVING FORWARD - NO BACKWARDS:**\nGoing RIGHT from (6,2) would be to (7,2) - THAT'S MY OWN BODY PART! That's death! \u2705 **ELIMINATE RIGHT**\n\n**OTHER DIRECTIONS:**\n- **UP to (6,3):** Check board... row 3 shows ` . . A . A . . . . ` so (6,3) is empty! Safe.\n- **DOWN to (6,1):** Row 1 shows ` . . . . . A . . . . ` so (6,1) is empty! Safe.\n- **LEFT to (5,2):** Row 2 shows ` A . . . . . A 1 T . . ` so (5,2) is empty! Safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nAll three moves are initially safe. Now consider board control:\n- Enemy is at right edge (9,4). They likely want to go LEFT toward center or UP/DOWN for apples.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,2), I'm moving away from enemy toward left side - good for splitting board control.\n- If I go UP to (6,3), I'm moving toward center but also toward apple at (5,1) below? Actually (5,1) is apple but that's DOWN then LEFT... hmm.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,1), I'm moving toward bottom-left area and could trap enemy in right corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMy goal is to box Snake #0 into the right side (columns 7-9) while I dominate left side. From (6,2), going LEFT toward the center line (column 5) gives me best positioning to cut off escape routes. Going DOWN is tempting for apples but brings me closer to enemy's potential path? Actually enemy is at right, so down is safe but...\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing LEFT to (5,2) is the most strategic. It moves me toward the central column, maintaining distance from enemy while positioning me to control the board. From there, I can potentially go DOWN or UP depending on enemy movement, keeping options open. Going DOWN (6,1) or UP (6,3) are more reactive to apple positions rather than board control.\n\n**CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD THE LEFT TRAIN!** \ud83d\ude82 LEFT",

If I go DOWN I stay glued to the right wall at x=9, limiting my next moves to just LEFT or DOWN and risk getting boxed in later.

Let's break this down:\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- My head: (4,2) | Body: [(5,2)] - We just moved LEFT last turn, so we're at (4,2) now.\n- Snake #0 head: (7,4) | Body: [(8,4), (9,4)] - They're creeping along the right side, probably trying to stay safe near the wall.\n- Apple positions: 15 of them scattered around. We're not FOCUSING on apples, but we might snag one on the way to trapping our enemy!\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS:**\nMy current position (4,2) has these options:\n- **UP to (4,3):** Row 3 shows ` . . A . A . . . . ` - (4,3) is EMPTY (no apple, no snake). SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (4,1):** Row 1 shows ` . . . . . A . . . . ` - (4,1) is EMPTY. SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (3,2):** Row 2 shows ` A . . . . . A 1 T . . ` - Wait, that's the old row 2! Let me recalculate. Row 2 is `A . . . . . A 1 T . .` with my head at (4,2) which is actually the space with `1`. So LEFT to (3,2) would be ` . . ` before the A? Actually looking at the board: Row 2 is `A . . . . . A 1 T . .` with coordinates 0-9. My head is at 4,2. So LEFT to 3,2 would be the fourth character which is ` . ` - EMPTY. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (5,2):** That's my OWN BODY! (5,2) is my tail from last turn. **DEAD** if I go right. NOPE!\n\n**ELIMINATING THE KILLER MOVE:**\nRIGHT is instant death into my own body. We're NOT doing that!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION TIME:**\nSnake #0 is at (7,4) with body at (8,4),(9,4). They're boxed in on the right wall. I need to cut off their escape to the left. \n\nFrom my position (4,2), moving LEFT to (3,2) moves me CLOSER to them and blocks more of the board. UP to (4,3) or DOWN to (4,1) are neutral but don't advance my trapping plan. \n\n**THE PLAY:**\n**LEFT to (3,2)** is the move! It positions me on column 3, one step closer to snake #0's position at column 7. From here, I can set up a blockade and force them into the top-right corner. If they move left next turn, I can cut them off. If they move up/down, I'll chase them along the wall.\n\n**FUTURE SELF PLAN:** If snake #0 moves left toward me, I'll continue left to column 2 to maintain pressure. If they move up toward (7,5), I'll move up to chase them along the top. We're building a wall!\n\n**LET'S CORNER THIS NOOB AND GET THE WIN!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down this board like a pro strategist.  \n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**  \n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (3,2) | Body: [(4,2)] | Apples: 1  \n  After last move LEFT, we're now at (3,2). Looking at the board row 2: `A . . . . . A 1 T . .` \u2013 actually, let me decode properly. Row 2 is:  \n  `0: A, 1: ., 2: ., 3: 1, 4: T (body), 5: ., 6: ., 7: A, 8: T (tail?), 9: .` Wait, the board shows `A . . 1 T . . . . .` at row 2. So coordinates:  \n  (0,2): A  \n  (1,2): .  \n  (2,2): .  \n  (3,2): 1 (MY HEAD)  \n  (4,2): T (my body)  \n  (5,2): .  \n  (6,2): .  \n  (7,2): A  \n  (8,2): T? Actually, board says `A . . 1 T . . . . .` so 8,2 is T? But my body is only one segment at (4,2). The board shows `1 T` at positions 3 and 4? Hmm, maybe it's a shorthand. Let's trust the data: my body is [(4,2)] from the description. So (4,2) is my body, (3,2) is head.  \n\n  My possible moves from (3,2):  \n  - **UP to (3,3):** Row 3: `. . A . A . . . . .` \u2192 (3,3) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n  - **DOWN to (3,1):** Row 1: `. . . . . A . . . .` \u2192 (3,1) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n  - **LEFT to (2,2):** Row 2: (2,2) is `.` (since `A . .` \u2192 index 2 is third char: `.`). SAFE.  \n  - **RIGHT to (4,2):** That's MY OWN BODY! (4,2) is my tail segment. Moving right would hit my body \u2192 INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATE RIGHT!  \n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (6,4) | Body: [(7,4), (8,4), (9,4)] | Apples: 3  \n  Row 4: `A . . . . A 0 T T T` \u2192 So (6,4) is '0' (enemy head), (7,4),(8,4),(9,4) are 'T' (body). They're along the right wall, facing left? Actually, head at (6,4) \u2013 if they move left, they go to (5,4) which is empty (row 4: index 5 is 'A'? Wait row 4: `A . . . . A 0 T T T` \u2192 let's index:  \n  0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:A, 6:0, 7:T, 8:T, 9:T. So (5,4) is A (apple). (6,4) is enemy head. If they move right, they hit their own body at (7,4). If they move up/down/left, they might go to empty spaces or apples.  \n\n  Key: They're cornered on the right. If they move left to (5,4), they eat an apple and grow. If they move up to (6,5), row 5: `. . . . . . . . . .` all empty. Down to (6,3): row 3: `. . A . A . . . . .` \u2192 (6,3) is empty. Left to (5,4) is apple. So they have options but are boxed by their body and wall.  \n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**  \n- **Immediate survival:** RIGHT is death. So eliminate that. UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe.  \n- **Score:** Enemy has 3 apples, we have 1. They're ahead. We need to close the gap and force them into a mistake.  \n- **Positioning:** From (3,2), we're not directly threatening snake #0 yet, but we can cut off their escape. If we move DOWN to (3,1), we stay low and might block an apple at (0,4) or others? Not sure.  \n- **Apple awareness (as a means to an end):** There's an apple at (5,1) \u2013 but we're at (3,2). Moving DOWN to (3,1) puts us adjacent to (5,1) but not directly on it. Moving LEFT to (2,2) gets us closer to apples on left? (0,6) is far. (0,2) is at x=0,y=2 \u2013 from (3,2), LEFT twice gets us there.  \n- **Aggression:** Enemy is at (6,4). We want to chase them and box them in. Moving LEFT (to (2,2)) actually takes us away from them? Wait, they're at x=6, we're at x=3. LEFT is x=2 (away from them). RIGHT is death. UP to (3,3) or DOWN to (3,1) are neutral moves.  \n- **But wait!** To box them in, we need to move toward the right side, not away. However, RIGHT is death. So we can't go right. The only way to get closer is to go UP or DOWN and then maybe right later? Actually, from (3,2), to get to x=6, we need to go right \u2013 but can't because of body. So we're stuck moving left/up/down to grow and reposition.  \n- **Long-term plan:** Since we can't go right, we need to loop around. Maybe go DOWN to (3,1), then RIGHT to (4,1) next turn? But (4,1) is empty (row 1: `. . . . . A . . . .` \u2192 index 4 is '.'). That would move us rightward without hitting our body because we'll have moved away.  \n  Alternatively, go LEFT to (2,2) then later go DOWN to (2,1) etc. But we want to pressure the enemy.  \n  Enemy is at (6,4). If they move left to (5,4) (apple), they grow to 4 apples. If they move up/down, they might go toward top or bottom.  \n  We need to intercept. From our current spot, the fastest path to their vicinity is to go DOWN then RIGHT repeatedly. But we must grow first.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \n- GO DOWN to (3,1). Why?  \n  1. It keeps us close to the bottom-left where there are apples at (0,2), (0,4), (5,1) etc. We can grow faster.  \n  2. It doesn't commit us left away from the enemy. From (3,1), next turn we can go RIGHT to (4,1) \u2013 which is safe and moves us toward the enemy's column.  \n  3. If we go LEFT to (2,2), we're moving away and might trap ourselves in the left corner. Not ideal.  \n  4. UP to (3,3) is fine, but (3,3) is empty and doesn't give a strategic advantage.  \n- **Risk of head-on collision:** Enemy might move toward us. If they move left to (5,4), that's still far. If they move down to (6,3), still not colliding. We're at y=1 or 2, they're at y=4. No immediate collision risk.  \n- **Future options:** From (3,1), we can go UP to (3,2) (which will be empty after we leave), RIGHT to (4,1), LEFT to (2,1), or DOWN to (3,0). (3,0) is empty (row 0: `. . . . . . . . . A`). So we have all 4 options open.  \n- **Content potential:** (5,1) is an apple to our right. From (3,1), we could go to (4,1) then (5,1) to eat it in two turns. That's good growth.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**  \nMove DOWN to (3,1) now. Next turn, assess enemy move. If enemy stays near right side, move RIGHT to (4,1) to advance toward them. Aim to grow by chasing apples on the bottom row while positioning to block enemy's leftward escape. If enemy moves up/down, we'll adjust to cut them off. We need to close the apple gap fast and force them into a corner.  \n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d DOWN into position!  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

SAFE.  \n\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (5,4) | Body: [(6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4)] | Apples: 4  \n  They moved LEFT from (6,4) to (5,4) to eat the apple! Now they're at (5,4) with body stretching right. They're growing and getting more dangerous. Their head is now at x=5, y=4. They're still confined to the right side but more mobile.\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**\n- **Immediate survival:** UP is death (into our own body). Eliminate UP. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe.\n- **Score gap:** Enemy has 4 apples, we have 1. They're pulling ahead! We NEED to eat apples fast and force collisions.\n- **Positioning:** We're at (3,1).

But we need to grow first!\n- **Aggression:** The enemy is growing and might try to move toward the center or bottom. We need to intercept. Moving RIGHT to (4,1) positions us to go for that apple next turn and gets us closer to their column.\n- **Long-term plan:** From (4,1), we can go RIGHT to (5,1) to eat the apple (GROW!), then we'll have more length to work with. Meanwhile, the enemy is at (5,4) - if they move DOWN to (5,3), we could potentially set up a collision if we grow and position right.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- GO RIGHT to (4,1). Why?  \n  1. **Aggression:** Moves us TOWARD the enemy's x-coordinate (5 vs our 3). We're closing the gap.  \n  2. **Apple chase:** Sets up for eating (5,1) next turn - that's CONTENT and growth.  \n  3. **Future options:** From (4,1), we'll have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) except LEFT back to (3,1) which is safe but not progressive.  \n  4. **Enemy prediction:** They might move DOWN or LEFT. If they move DOWN to (5,3), we're at (4,1) with potential to go RIGHT then UP to (5,2) to cut them off.  \n  5. **Avoiding traps:** LEFT keeps us in left side, DOWN goes to corner - RIGHT keeps us central and aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nMove RIGHT to (4,1) now. Next turn, if enemy doesn't block, GO RIGHT to (5,1) to EAT THE APPLE! Grow to 2 apples. Then we'll have length to work with.

We're still behind, but we just ate and grew\u2014now we're at Head: (5,1), Body: [(4,1), (3,1)] (from last move). That means our previous tail (3,1) is now free space. Good. They're at (4,3) with a long tail stretching right. Their head is right above us at y=4! They're close.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (Current Turn 7):**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head: (5,1), Body: [(4,1), (3,1)].  \n  From (5,1), possible moves:  \n  - **UP to (5,2):** Row 2: `A . . . . . . . . .` \u2192 (5,2) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n  - **DOWN to (5,0):** Row 0: `. . . . . . . . . A` \u2192 (5,0) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n  - **LEFT to (4,1):** That's my own body (second segment)! DEAD if I go there.  \n  - **RIGHT to (6,1):** Row 1: `. . . . . T T 1 . .` \u2192 (6,1) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n\n- **Snake #0:** Head: (4,3), Body: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)].  \n  They're directly above me at (4,3). Their body is mostly to the right (y=4). If they move DOWN to (4,2), they'd be one cell above my head? No\u2014wait, (4,2) is above my head at (5,1)? Actually, coordinates: (4,3) \u2192 DOWN is (4,2). My head is at (5,1). So (4,2) is adjacent diagonally? But in snake, movement is orthogonal. They could move DOWN to (4,2), which is near but not directly into me. If they move RIGHT to (5,3), that's above my head? (5,3) is above (5,2). They could threaten me later.\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS & STRATEGY:**\n- **Immediate survival:** LEFT is death (into my own body). Eliminate LEFT. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe.\n- **Score gap:** They have 5, we have 2. We NEED more apples. Look at the board: Apple at (5,2) is RIGHT ABOVE US (UP from current head)! But wait, my head is now at (5,1). If I go UP to (5,2), that's an apple! Yes! From the apple list: (5,2) is an apple? Actually, the apple list includes (5,7), (8,9), etc. Let me check the apple list again: Apples: (6,6), (0,6), (0,2), (2,7), (2,3), (7,8), (9,0), (9,9), (0,4), (5,7), (8,9), (7,7), (1,3), (6,9), (8,3). No (5,2)! Oops, I misread. Row 2 shows \"A\" at (0,2) but (5,2) is empty. So no apple at (5,2). My bad. The apple at (5,7) is far away. So no immediate apple growth from my head position.\n- **But wait:** The apple list includes (2,3), (5,7), etc. From (5,1), the closest apples are: (2,3) is left and up, (5,7) is up 6 cells, (7,8) is up/right, (9,9) is far. Actually, (6,6) is also an apple. But none are immediate. So no apple at (5,2). So UP doesn't eat.\n- **Aggression:** Enemy is at (4,3). If I go UP to (5,2), I move closer to them. If they go DOWN to (4,2), we're adjacent. If they go RIGHT to (5,3), they might chase an apple? (5,3) is empty? Row 3: `. A A . 0 . . . A .` \u2192 (5,3) is \"0\"? Wait, no: (4,3) is their head, (5,3) is empty? The board shows row 3: `. A A . 0 . . . A .` where \"0\" is their head? Actually, (4,3) is \"0\", so (5,3) is empty. So they could move RIGHT to (5,3). If I go UP to (5,2), and they go RIGHT to (5,3), they'd be above me. Not immediate collision.\n- **Head-on collision:** If I go UP and they go DOWN, they go to (4,2) and I go to (5,2)\u2014different cells, no collision. If I go RIGHT and they go DOWN to (4,2), no collision. If I go DOWN, I might get closer to bottom apples like (9,0) but far away.\n- **Forcing collision:** We have 2 apples vs their 5. We need more apples first to have higher score for collision. Currently, we can't win a head-on collision (we'd die). So avoid direct collision until we have 3+ apples maybe.\n- **Positioning:** The enemy is in column 4, we're in column 5. We're to their right. If we go RIGHT to (6,1), we move away from them, toward the right side. That might be good for control. But we lose proximity to central apples.\n- **Boxing them in:** They're at (4,3) with body to the right. If we go LEFT? No, can't. If we go UP to (5,2), we're closer to their head. If we go DOWN to (5,0), we go to bottom row\u2014might trap us if they come down later.\n- **Future options:** From (5,2) (if UP), we have: UP (5,3) - empty? Row 3: (5,3) is empty, but (4,3) is enemy head, so if they move into (5,3) and we also? Possible collision. LEFT (4,2) - empty? Row 2: (4,2) is empty. RIGHT (6,2) - empty. DOWN back to (5,1) - safe but backtracking. So UP gives 3 forward options. From (5,0) (DOWN): LEFT (4,0) - empty, RIGHT (6,0) - empty, UP back to (5,1). Also 3 options. From (6,1) (RIGHT): LEFT back to (5,1), UP (6,2) empty, DOWN (6,0) empty. Also 3 options.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **DOWN to (5,0):** Why?  \n  1. **Safety:** Moves us to the bottom row, away from the enemy at y=3. Less immediate collision risk.  \n  2. **Apple potential:** The bottom row has an apple at (9,0). From (5,0), we can head right toward it. Also apple at (0,4) but that's left/up.  \n  3. **Avoiding trap:** Enemy might move DOWN to (4,2) or further. If we're at (5,0), we're not in their direct path. If they come down, we can go RIGHT to (6,0) and keep distance.  \n  4. **Growth strategy:** We need apples. The apple at (9,0) is 4 cells right. We can start moving right along the bottom. The apple at (0,6) is too far left/up.  \n  5. **Enemy prediction:** They might move DOWN to chase an apple or LEFT to (3,3) for safety. If they move DOWN, we're already low and can avoid. If they move RIGHT, we're out of their way.  \n  6. **UP** to (5,2) puts us closer to enemy (y=2 vs y=3). Risky if they move DOWN.  \n  7. **RIGHT** to (6,1) moves us right but still at y=1, where enemy could chase.  \n  8. **DOWN** gives us breathing room and sets up a rightward push for the (9,0) apple. We need that apple to close the score gap (3 apples vs their 5).  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe're at (5,1). Go DOWN to (5,0). Next turn, move RIGHT toward (9,0) apple. Monitor enemy: if they head down, we can pivot left or right. Aim to eat at least 2 more apples before engaging. We want to reach 4 apples so we can force a head-on collision when we have higher score. Dominate the bottom-right corner first.  \n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d DOWN to secure the bottom and set up a chase!  \nDOWN",

We're behind, but we just moved DOWN to (5,0) last turn. Now our head is at (5,0), body is [(5,1), (4,1)]\u2014wait, no: from the board state, our body is [(5,1), (4,1)], so the tail is at (4,1). That means (5,1) is now empty? Actually, careful: after moving, our head is at (5,0), the previous head (5,1) becomes the first body segment, and (4,1) remains the second. So body is [(5,1), (4,1)], tail at (4,1). Good.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (Turn 8):**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head: (5,0), Body: [(5,1), (4,1)].  \n  From (5,0), possible moves:  \n  - **UP to (5,1):** That's my own body! DEAD if I go there.  \n  - **DOWN to (5,-1):** Off the board! DEAD.  \n  - **LEFT to (4,0):** Row 0: `. . . . . . . . . A` \u2192 (4,0) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n  - **RIGHT to (6,0):** Row 0: (6,0) is EMPTY. SAFE.  \n\n- **Snake #0:** Head: (3,3), Body: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)].  \n  They're at (3,3) with body to the right. They might move DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3), UP to (3,4), or RIGHT to (4,3)\u2014but (4,3) is their own body! So RIGHT is death for them. They likely won't go that way.\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS:**\n- **Immediate survival:** UP and DOWN are dead moves. Only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n- **Enemy prediction:** From (3,3), they might move DOWN to (3,2) (apple at (2,3) is near), LEFT to (2,3) (apple at (2,3) exists!), UP to (3,4) (empty), or RIGHT to (4,3) (death, so probably not). If they move LEFT to (2,3), that's an apple! They might eat and grow. We need to close the gap.\n- **Apple opportunities:** From our head (5,0), the closest apples are: (9,0) to the right (4 cells away), (0,4) up-left, (2,3) up-left, (5,7) up. None are immediate. But we need to start moving toward an apple.\n- **Aggression:** We have fewer apples (2 vs 5), so we must avoid head-on collision until we have 3+ apples. For now, we need to grow.\n- **Positioning:** Moving LEFT to (4,0) puts us closer to the left side where apples like (0,4) and (2,3) are. But (0,6) and (0,2) are also left. Moving RIGHT to (6,0) heads toward (9,0) apple along the bottom. Bottom-right might be safer long-term? Enemy is at y=3, so bottom is clear for now.\n- **Future options:**  \n  - LEFT to (4,0): From there, we can go UP to (4,1)\u2014but that's our body? Wait, body is at (4,1) currently, so UP would be into our own body after the turn? Actually, after moving left to (4,0), our body will shift: new head (4,0), old head (5,0) becomes body, old body (5,1) becomes next, tail (4,1) will move off. So (4,1) will become empty after the move! So from (4,0), UP to (4,1) will be safe next turn (since tail moves). That opens up moves toward left-side apples.  \n  - RIGHT to (6,0): From there, we can go RIGHT to (7,0) or UP to (6,1) (which is empty now). Also safe options.\n- **Boxing them in:** We're not boxing yet\u2014we're too low. Need to grow first.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **LEFT to (4,0):** Why?  \n  1. **Safety:** It's safe, and after the move, our tail (4,1) will free up, so we'll have 3 forward options next turn: UP to (4,1) (now safe), LEFT to (3,0), or RIGHT back to (5,0).  \n  2. **Apple potential:** This sets us up to move LEFT or UP toward the left-side apples (0,4), (0,2), (2,3). The apple at (2,3) is reachable via (4,0) \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) or similar. We can start that path.  \n  3. **Avoiding trap:** Moving RIGHT to (6,0) is fine, but the bottom-right has only (9,0) and (9,9) as apples\u2014far away. Left side has more clustered apples (three on left: (0,2), (0,4), (0,6)). Better growth potential.  \n  4. **Enemy avoidance:** Enemy is at (3,3). If we go LEFT to (4,0), we're not in their immediate path. They might move DOWN or LEFT, but we're at y=0, so we're below them.  \n  5. **Score gap:** We need apples fast. Left side apples are closer in terms of moves from our position.  \n  6. **RIGHT to (6,0)** moves us away from apples and toward empty space with only one apple (9,0) nearby\u2014less efficient.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nHead left along the bottom to target apple (0,2) or (0,4) while monitoring enemy. If they chase left, we can pivot right later. Aim to eat 2 apples quickly to reach 4 apples, then consider aggressive plays. Avoid bottom-right\u2014it's a dead end.\n\n**LET'S GO!** \ud83d\udc0d LEFT to set up the left-side apple chase!  \nLEFT",

Last turn we went LEFT to (4,0), and now our body is [(5,0), (5,1)]? Wait, let's check the new board state after our move:\n\n**MY CURRENT STATE (Post-Last Move):**\n- Head: (4,0)\n- Body: [(5,0), (5,1)] (tail at (5,1)? Actually, from the board state, our body is shown as [(5,0), (5,1)] with tail at (5,1)? Let's verify: From (4,0), our previous head was (5,0) which becomes body, and previous body was (5,1)? Actually, from Turn 8: We were at (5,0) with body [(5,1), (4,1)]. We moved LEFT to (4,0). So new head: (4,0). New body: previous head (5,0) + previous body without tail: (5,1) \u2192 so body is [(5,0), (5,1)]? But the board state shows: \n  - Row 0: \". . . A 1 T . . . A\" \u2192 at (4,0) is '1', at (5,0) is 'T'? Wait, the board state given: \n    Row 0: \". . . A 1 T . . . A\"\n    That means (0,0) '.', (1,0) '.', (2,0) '.', (3,0) 'A', (4,0) '1', (5,0) 'T', (6,0) '.', (7,0) '.', (8,0) '.', (9,0) 'A'. \n    So our head is at (4,0) (represented as '1'), and (5,0) is 'T' (tail). So our body is actually just [(5,0)]? No, that can't be right because we had two body segments before. Let's re-read: The board state shows \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (4,0), Body: [(5,0), (5,1)]\" \u2014 Wait, the user message says: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (4,0), Body: [(5,0), (5,1)]\". So body is two segments: (5,0) and (5,1). And the board state shows at row 0, (5,0) is 'T' (tail), and at row 1, (5,1) is 'T'? Actually row 1: \". . . . . T . . . .\" \u2192 at (5,1) is 'T'. So yes, body is [(5,0), (5,1)] with tail at (5,1). Good.\n\n**OPPONENT STATE:**\n- Snake #0: Head: (2,3), Body: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)] (from user message). So they are still at (2,3) with body extending right.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Current Turn 9):**\n```\n9 . . . . . . A . A A\n8 . . . . . . . A . .\n7 . . A . . A . A . .\n6 A . . . . .

A\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\nInterpretation:\n- Apples: (0,6), (0,2), (2,7), (7,8), (9,0), (9,9), (0,4), (5,7), (8,9), (7,7), (1,3), (6,9), (8,3), (3,0), (6,6) \u2014 15 total.\n- Snake #0: head at (2,3), body at (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) \u2014 that's 6 segments (head + 5 body). Apples: 6.\n- My snake: head at (4,0), body at (5,0), (5,1) \u2014 3 segments total (head + 2 body). Apples: 2.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS & SURVIVAL CHECK:**\nFrom head (4,0), consider all moves:\n1. **UP to (4,1):** Row 1: \". . . . . T . . . .\" \u2192 (4,1) is '.' (empty). BUT is it occupied by my own body? My body is at (5,0) and (5,1). (4,1) is not in my body list, so it's safe from self-collision. However, we must check if the enemy head or body moves into (4,1) this turn. Since enemy is at (2,3) with body at (3,3) etc., they might move DOWN to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,3) or UP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3) (which is their own body, so they won't). If they move DOWN to (2,2), that's not (4,1). If they move LEFT to (1,3), that's not (4,1). So (4,1) is likely safe from immediate enemy collision. But we also need to consider if they could grow and reach (4,1)? Not this turn\u2014they're too far. So UP seems safe.\n2. **DOWN to (4,-1):** Off board! DEAD. \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (3,0):** Row 0: (3,0) is 'A' (apple). Is it occupied by any snake? My body: (5,0) and (5,1) \u2014 not (3,0). Enemy body: at y=3-4, so not (3,0). Enemy head: (2,3) \u2014 not (3,0). So (3,0) is empty and has an apple! Moving there would eat the apple and we grow. But we must check if the enemy head moves into (3,0) simultaneously? Enemy at (2,3) could move DOWN to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,3) \u2014 not (3,0). So it's safe. However, if enemy moves RIGHT to (3,3) (their own body, they won't), or if they move DOWN and then maybe? No, (3,0) is not in their path. So LEFT is safe and gives an apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (5,0):** Row 0: (5,0) is 'T' (tail of my own body). That's my own body! If I move RIGHT to (5,0), I would be moving into my own tail. That's a collision with my own body \u2192 DEAD. \u274c\n\nWait, but my tail is at (5,1)? The board shows (5,0) as 'T' and (5,1) as 'T'. Actually, from the board state: (5,0) is 'T' (tail) and (5,1) is also 'T'? That can't be\u2014there's only one tail. Let's clarify: The board representation uses 'T' for the entire snake body except the head. So (5,0) and (5,1) are both part of the body. So moving RIGHT into (5,0) would be moving into my own body (the first body segment). That's definitely death. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\nSo the only safe moves are UP (to (4,1)) and LEFT (to (3,0)). DOWN is off-board, RIGHT is into own body.\n\n**NOW, AMONG SAFE MOVES, WHICH IS BETTER?**\n- **LEFT to (3,0):** This is an apple! Moving left eats the apple at (3,0). That means we grow by 1 segment, and our score increases to 3 apples. That's huge\u2014we need to close the gap (enemy has 6). Also, after eating, our body will expand: new head (3,0), old head (4,0) becomes body, old body shifts: (5,0) becomes next, (5,1) becomes tail? Actually, after eating, we grow, so the tail doesn't move off this turn? In Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment at your current tail position (the tail remains the same for that turn). So our body will be: new head (3,0), then (4,0), then (5,0), then (5,1) as tail? Wait, our current body is [(5,0), (5,1)] with tail at (5,1). After moving left to (3,0) and eating, the new body becomes: [ (3,0) as head, (4,0) as body1, (5,0) as body2, (5,1) as tail? Actually, the order is head -> ... -> tail. So the new list: head (3,0), then previous head (4,0), then previous body[0] (5,0), then previous body[1] (5,1) (since we grew, tail stays). So body length increases by 1. That's good.\n- **UP to (4,1):** This is empty, no apple. We don't grow. Our body shifts: head (4,1), body becomes [(4,0), (5,0)], tail (5,0)? Actually, after moving up, old head (4,0) becomes body, old body (5,0) becomes next, old tail (5,1) is shed off? Wait, in non-growth moves, the tail moves off. So body becomes [(4,0), (5,0)], tail at (5,0). That's still 3 segments. No score increase.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- LEFT gives an apple \u2192 growth \u2192 score 3, closes gap to 3 vs 6. That's critical. We need apples fast to catch up.\n- UP keeps us at score 2, no growth. We'll have to chase other apples later.\n\nBut we must consider if LEFT is truly safe from enemy moves. Enemy at (2,3) could potentially move to (3,0)? No, they're at y=3, so moving down 3 steps to y=0 is impossible in one turn. They move one step. So they can't reach (3,0) this turn. However, they might move to a position that threatens us later, but for immediate survival, LEFT is safe.\n\nAlso, after LEFT to (3,0), our new head position (3,0) is close to enemy head (2,3) \u2014 only 3 cells away. But they're at y=3, we're at y=0, so we're below them. They might move down toward us? Possibly, but we can react next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to eat apples aggressively to catch up. After eating at (3,0), we should head toward the next apple. From (3,0), we can go RIGHT back to (4,0), UP to (3,1), LEFT to (2,0), or DOWN is off-board. (2,0) is empty? Row 0: (2,0) is '.' (empty). Up to (3,1) is empty? Row 1: (3,1) is '.' (empty). So we'll have options. The apple at (0,2) or (0,4) or (0,6) are left/up. We can path toward them while monitoring enemy. If enemy comes down, we might need to dodge. But for now, eating this apple is the best move to grow and close the score.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT \u2014 eat the apple at (3,0), grow, score to 3, and set up future moves. UP is safe but no growth, which falls behind faster. We need to be aggressive and chase apples. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

UP \u2192 (4,1)**  \n- Cell (4,1) is empty (row\u202f1 shows '.' there).  \n- Not in my body list.  \n- Enemy head (2,3) is 2 units away in y\u2011direction; they cannot reach (4,1) in one move.  \n- No apple \u2192 no growth \u2192 score stays 3.  \n- **Future options:** From (4,1) we could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (but (5,1) is our body, so RIGHT would be into own body unless tail moves), or DOWN back to (4,0).  \n- **Downside:** No score increase, we fall further behind on apples.\n\n**B. LEFT \u2192 (3,0)**  \n- Cell (3,0) contains an **apple** (\u2018A\u2019 on row\u202f0).  \n- Not in my body list.  \n- Enemy head (2,3) is too far to reach (3,0) in one move (they would need to drop 3 rows and 1 column).  \n- **Effect:** Eating the apple \u2192 we grow by 1 segment \u2192 score becomes **4 apples**.  \n- **Future options:** From (3,0) we can go RIGHT (back to (4,0), empty after tail moves), UP (3,1, empty), or LEFT (2,0, empty). All are safe and offer good mobility.  \n- **Risk assessment:** After eating, our head will be at (3,0), closer to the opponent\u2019s vertical line at x=2\u20117, y=3\u20114. However, we are still 3 rows below, and the opponent is likely to move toward other apples or stay in their lane. We can react next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 4)\u202f**STRATEGIC COMPARISON**  \n\n| Factor | LEFT (to (3,0)) | UP (to (4,1)) |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Immediate safety | \u2705 (no collision, not off\u2011board) | \u2705 |\n| Apple gain | \u2705 (+1 apple) | \u274c |\n| Score gap closure | \u2705 (4 vs 7) | \u274c (3 vs 7) |\n| Growth & future flexibility | \u2705 (longer snake, more reach) | \u274c (same length) |\n| Risk of being boxed in | Low (multiple exits) | Moderate (still near bottom edge) |\n\nGiven our objective is to **win by closing the apple gap** and the enemy is ahead by 4 apples, taking the guaranteed apple now is critical. Playing it safe with no growth leaves us further behind and increases the chance we\u2019ll be outrun later.\n\n---\n\n### 5)\u202f**LONG\u2011TERM PLAN**  \nAfter eating the apple at (3,0), our head will be at (3,0) with body [(4,0), (5,0), (5,1)] (new tail at (5,1)).  \n- **Next turn options:**  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,0) (now empty) \u2014 maintain position near bottom row.  \n  - **UP** \u2192 (3,1) \u2014 start moving toward the cluster of apples at (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (2,7).  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 (2,0) \u2014 explore left side, but watch for enemy if they descend.  \n- **Enemy monitoring:** Enemy is at (2,3) with body stretching right. If they move DOWN or LEFT, they could approach our area. We\u2019ll keep an eye on their head direction next turn and adjust to force a head\u2011on collision if we gain a score lead.  \n- **Goal:** Continue aggressive apple\u2011hunting to reach 30 apples first or force opponent into a mistake (crash into our body). Stay out of tight corners and always keep at least two escape routes.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nWe choose **LEFT** to eat the apple, grow, and close the score gap. This is the most aggressive and beneficial move among safe options.  \n\n**LEFT**",

Actually after eating, my body grows! So new body: [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]? No, hold on - the apple was at (3,1), which is where I am now, so my old head (2,1) becomes part of body. So: **Head: (3,1), Body: [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)]** - length 5.\n- Enemy head: (0, 5) - they moved down from (0,4)!\n- Enemy body: [(0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] - they're growing left-to-right along row 3, 4, 5.\n\n**BOARD CHECK:**\nLooking at grid:\nRow 1: `. . . 1 . . . . . .` - I'm at (3,1), clear around.\nRow 2: `A . . . . . . . . .` - (3,2) is empty! Good.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . A .` - (3,3) is enemy body! No collision risk this turn since we're at same column but different row.\n\n**ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 2): Empty? Row 2 shows `.` at column 3! \u2705 Safe! Opens up UP, LEFT, RIGHT from there.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 0): My body! (3,0) is part of my body. \u274c DEAD!\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 1): My body! (2,1) is part of my body (old head). \u274c DEAD!\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 1): Empty? Row 1 shows `.` at column 4! \u2705 Safe! Opens up UP, LEFT, RIGHT from there (DOWN would be back to (3,1) - safe).\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**BOTH UP and RIGHT are viable!** LEFT and DOWN are death.\n\nLet's compare:\n- **UP to (3,2):** Gets me toward apple at (2,7) and (5,7) clusters. Opens up LEFT, RIGHT, UP options. Enemy is far left, not an immediate threat.\n- **RIGHT to (4,1):** Gets me toward apple at (7,8), (9,9), (8,9) - more apple concentration on right side. Also opens up UP, LEFT, RIGHT options. Enemy is far left.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (0,5) with body along 3-5 rows. They might go RIGHT toward center apples (2,7), (5,7), (7,7) or DOWN toward (0,2) or UP toward (0,6). They're hunting.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nRight now we're at 4 apples, enemy at 8. We need to eat FAST. Which direction has more apples we can reach quickly?\n- UP from (3,2): Next to (2,2)? Empty. Then can go to (2,3) but that's enemy body. (3,3) is enemy too. Might get boxed in.\n- RIGHT from (4,1): Can go to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)... then UP toward those apple clusters at (7,7), (8,9), (9,9). Looks cleaner path.\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT to (4,1)!** Why? Because from there I can go UP next turn and potentially reach the apple cluster on the right side (9,9) which is unclaimed. Also, moving right puts me further from enemy's current position (they're left side). \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (4,1), next turn go UP to (4,2) or (5,2) to start navigating toward the right-side apples. Keep enemy on our left flank and force them to come through our territory. If we can get to 10+ apples first, we might force a head-on collision when we have the score advantage!\n\n**CHAT - WE'RE GOING RIGHT!** Taking the path toward the apple jackpot on the right side!

          "rationale": "**STREAM CHAT WE'RE AT TURN 14!** \ud83d\udd25 Time to make a move! Score is 4 vs 9 - we're behind but still in this! My head at (4,1) needs to survive and hunt! Let's break it down.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (4, 1)\n- **My body:** [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0)] - length 5\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head (0, 6), Body along left side\n\n**BOARD CHECK (from the state at turn 14 start):**\nGrid shows:\nRow 1: `. . T T 1 . . . . .` at x=4? Wait, at x=4 is the head `1`. Adjacent: x=3 is body `T`, x=5 is empty `.`, x=4 y=0 is empty `.`, x=4 y=2 is empty `.` (from grid row 2: `. . A . . . . . . .` at x=4? Actually row 2: `. . A . . . . . . .` - x=2 is apple `A`, x=4 is empty `.`). So all four directions are potentially open except into self.\n\n**ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\n- **UP (4,2):** From grid, row 2 shows at x=4: `.` (empty). Check if it's enemy body? Enemy body is mostly left (x=0-5 but specific positions: body at (0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4),(5,4)). (4,3) is enemy body, but (4,2) is not in enemy body list. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN (4,0):** From grid row 0: `. . T T . . . . . A` - x=4 y=0 is `.` (empty). Is it my body? My body has (2,0) and (3,0) but not (4,0). Wait, my body is [(3,1),(2,1),(2,0),(3,0)]. (4,0) is NOT in my body. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT (3,1):** My body! (3,1) is the first element of my body list. \u274c DEAD (hitting own body).\n- **RIGHT (5,1):** From grid row 1: `. . T T 1 . . . . .` at x=5: it's `.` (empty). Check enemy body: none at (5,1). \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWhich move gives the best chance to eat apples and dominate?\n- **UP to (4,2):** This moves toward apple at (2,7) and (5,7) clusters. From (4,2), I can see apple at (2,2) is empty? Actually (2,2) is empty? Grid row 2: `. . A . . . . . . .` - x=2 is apple `A` at (2,2)? Wait, (2,2) is y=2, x=2. Yes, row 2 shows `. . A . . . . . . .` meaning (0,2) empty, (1,2) empty, (2,2) apple, (3,2) empty, etc. So (2,2) is apple! That's only 2 steps away: from (4,1) UP to (4,2), then LEFT to (3,2), LEFT to (2,2) for apple. But need to watch enemy. Enemy at (0,6) might move toward right side too. Also from (4,2), I can go to (4,3) but that's enemy body (occupied). So UP might limit vertical movement after one step.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,0):** From there, I can go LEFT to (3,0) but that's my body (current body at (3,0)). Actually (3,0) is in my body list, so LEFT from (4,0) would hit my own body. UP to (4,1) is back to current head - that's moving backwards into my own body? Wait, if I go DOWN to (4,0), then next turn going UP would move to (4,1), which is where my head was this turn. But since I moved, my body shifts, so (4,1) becomes part of my body? Actually after moving DOWN to (4,0), my new body would be [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]? No, wait: head moves from (4,1) to (4,0). The tail (3,0) moves forward? Actually standard snake: head moves, tail moves (unless ate apple). Since we didn't eat an apple this turn (no apple at (4,0)), the tail moves forward. So new body: head (4,0), body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]? Let's simulate: Old head (4,1) becomes body, old body shifts: (3,1) becomes first body, (2,1) becomes second, (2,0) becomes third, (3,0) was tail and moves away? Actually if no apple eaten, the tail is removed. So new body length remains 5: head (4,0), body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]? Wait, need to list old body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)]. When head moves to (4,0), new body: old head (4,1) added, tail (3,0) removed. So new body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]? Actually the list should be HEAD-TO-TAIL: first is head, then connections. So new snake: Head (4,0), then body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]? That would be length 5 (head + 4 body). But old length was 5 (head + 4 body). So yes. So from (4,0), I can go UP to (4,1) which is now my own body (part of body), so that would be hitting myself. Similarly, LEFT to (3,0) is empty? (3,0) is not in my new body list? Actually (3,0) was tail and moved away, so (3,0) is now empty. But wait, my new body is [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)] so (3,0) is not in body. So LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0) is safe? But we need to check board state: (3,0) is `T` in grid? Grid row 0: `. . T T . . . . . A` - at x=3 y=0 is `T` (my body?). But after moving, (3,0) might be empty because tail moved. But the grid shows current state BEFORE move. So (3,0) is currently my body. But after I move DOWN to (4,0), the tail (3,0) will be removed, so (3,0) becomes empty. However, we must consider that the grid shows current state, and we are planning our move. When we move, we must ensure our head doesn't go into a cell that is currently occupied (by any body or apple). Actually rules: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" So we check against CURRENT state. So if we move DOWN to (4,0), is (4,0) currently occupied? Grid shows (4,0) is `.` (empty). So that's safe. But what about next turn? We're not planning next turn yet; we just need to survive this turn. So DOWN is safe for this turn. However, from (4,0) after moving, our movement options next turn are limited: we can go LEFT to (3,0) (will be empty after tail moves), RIGHT to (5,0), UP to (4,1) (which will be our own body at that time), DOWN is out of board (y=0 is bottom, y=-1 is out). So from (4,0) we only have LEFT and RIGHT as forward moves (UP is back into own body, which is death). So DOWN move might trap us into a corridor. Let's see: (4,0) has LEFT (3,0) empty, RIGHT (5,0) empty? Grid row 0: x=5 is `.` (empty). So we have two forward moves. But we are near the bottom edge, and apple at (6,9) is far.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,1):** From there, I can go UP to (5,2) (empty? Grid row 2: at x=5 is `.`), LEFT to (4,1) (will be my body after move, so death next turn), DOWN to (5,0) (empty), RIGHT to (6,1) (empty? Grid row 1: x=6 is `.`). So from (5,1), I have three forward moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is back into own body (death). This seems better than DOWN which gives only two forward moves (LEFT, RIGHT). UP from (5,1) leads toward apple cluster (9,9) etc. Also, from (5,1), I can go to (5,2) then maybe to (6,2) etc. There are apples on right: (6,9), (8,9), (9,9), (7,8), (8,3), etc. (5,7) is also an apple. So RIGHT seems to open up more paths.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (0,6). They might go RIGHT toward center (maybe to get apples at (2,7), (5,7)), or UP to (0,7) (empty? Grid row 7: `. . A . . . . A . .` - x=0 y=7 is `.`), or DOWN to (0,5) (which is their body? Actually their head was (0,6), body includes (0,5) so DOWN would hit own body? They just came from (0,5) so moving back down might be death. They might go RIGHT to (1,6) which is empty? Grid row 6: `0 . . . . . . A . .` - x=1 y=6 is `.`. So likely they go RIGHT or UP.\n\n**STRATEGIC GOAL:**\nWe need to eat apples quickly to catch up (4 vs 9). Looking at apples: (2,2) is closest (2 steps away if we go UP then LEFT). But (2,2) is in the left-middle, near enemy territory. (6,9) is far but unclaimed. (5,7) is also somewhat far. (8,3) is moderate distance. (9,9) is top-right corner.\n\nWhich path has more apples? Right side has (6,9), (8,9), (9,9), (7,8), (8,3), (7,7) - many! Left side has (0,2), (2,7), (2,4), (2,8), (4,2) - fewer. But (2,2) is very close. However, enemy is on left, so going left might lead to confrontation. We want to avoid head-on unless we have score advantage. We're behind, so we need to eat without dying.\n\nIf we go RIGHT, we move toward right-side apples and away from enemy. If we go UP, we go toward (2,2) apple but also toward enemy territory.\n\nAlso consider board control: RIGHT moves us to column 5, which is more central, giving us access to both left and right later. UP to (4,2) puts us at y=2, near enemy body at (4,3). That's risky because if enemy moves DOWN or something, we could collide next turn.\n\nLet's check collision possibilities this turn: We move simultaneously with enemy. If we move UP to (4,2) and enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6) or something, no collision. If we move RIGHT to (5,1) and enemy moves RIGHT to (1,6), no collision. But we need to consider if enemy might move into our new position? Unlikely since they're far.\n\n**DECISION:**\nRIGHT seems better for long-term growth: opens up three forward directions, moves toward apple cluster, and keeps us away from enemy. Also, from (5,1) we can go to (6,1), (7,1) etc. and then UP to (7,2), (7,3)... eventually to (7,7) apple.\n\nUP to (4,2) also seems okay, but (4,2) is only 2 steps from apple at (2,2), but from there, after eating (2,2), we might be stuck near enemy body. Actually, from (4,2) we can go LEFT to (3,2) then LEFT to (2,2) for apple. That's two moves. From RIGHT move, we might take more steps to reach an apple but we have more options.\n\nLet's also consider that there's an apple at (5,7) - from RIGHT path, we could go UP to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)... but (5,4) is enemy body? Enemy body has (5,4) according to list: (5,4) is part of enemy body. So we can't go there. Actually enemy body: (5,4) is listed. So we must avoid (5,4). So path to (5,7) might be blocked. Better to go to (6,9) via right side: from (5,1) go UP to (5,2), then RIGHT to (6,2), then UP, etc. No enemy bodies there.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (8,3) which is on right side at y=3. From (5,1) we can go RIGHT to (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), then UP to (8,2), (8,3) for apple. That seems viable.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n- RIGHT gives more forward options and moves toward right-side apples.\n- UP gives a short-term apple (2,2) but might lead to congestion near enemy.\n- DOWN leads to a corridor with limited options.\n\nWe're behind on apples, so we need to secure apples safely. RIGHT seems the safest and most strategic for hunting multiple apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (5,1) next turn, go UP to (5,2) to start moving toward (8,3) or (6,9). Keep enemy on left flank, force them to cross the board if they want confrontation. Build score safely.\n\n**CHAT - WE'RE GOING RIGHT!** Toward the apple jackpot on the right! Let's eat! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

So three forward paths.\n   - Moves us toward RIGHT-SIDE apples: (8,3) is 2 steps away: (6,1) \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (8,3). Also (6,9) is reachable via upward path: (6,1) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 ... \u2192 (6,9).\n   - Enemy is on left, so we\u2019re moving AWAY from them \u2013 safer! No head-on risk.\n\n3. **UP to (5,2):**\n   - Moves us to row 2. From there, we can go UP to (5,3) (empty? row 3 at x=5 is `.`? Actually row 3: `T T T T T . . . A .` \u2013 x=5 is `.`), LEFT to (4,2) (empty), RIGHT to (6,2) (empty), DOWN back to (5,1) (death). So three forward paths.\n   - Apple at (5,7) is straight up, but (5,4) is enemy body! So we\u2019d need to detour. Apple at (2,2) is close: (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2). That\u2019s 2 moves, but that area is near enemy territory.\n   - Risk: enemy might move toward center. If we go UP, we\u2019re closer to their current head (1,6) and body.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (1,6) has options: RIGHT to (2,6) (empty), UP to (1,7) (empty), DOWN to (1,5) (body? (1,5) not in body, but (0,5) is body \u2013 they might not go back down). They\u2019re likely to move RIGHT/UP toward apples (2,7), (5,7), (7,8). If we go UP to (5,2), we\u2019re heading toward the same central apples \u2013 potential future collision risk.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need apples FAST to catch up. Right side has a CLUSTER of 5+ apples! Left side has fewer and enemy is camping there. We should aggressively claim the right side, build length, and force enemy to cross the board if they want a fight. Avoid head-on unless we\u2019re ahead \u2013 we\u2019re NOT ahead (4 vs 9), so we NEED to eat safely.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **DOWN** = tight corridor, few apples.\n- **UP** = toward enemy territory, riskier.\n- **RIGHT** = opens right-side hunting grounds, away from enemy, multiple forward paths.\n\n**CHOOOOOSE RIGHT!** We\u2019re going for the apple jackpot on the right!

Let's break down the board and plot our move.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (6, 1) \u2013 just moved RIGHT from (5, 1)!\n- **My body:** [(5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)] \u2013 length 5. (Note: I think the board shows a T at (2,0) but that might be an old tail or something. My body list doesn't include it, so I'll trust the list.)\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head (2, 6), body: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)].\n- **Apples:** Tasty dots everywhere! Right side has a jackpot: (6,9), (8,9), (9,9), (7,8), (8,3), (7,7), (6,9) \u2013 wait, (6,9) listed twice, but it's there. Left side has (0,2), (2,7), etc., but enemy is camping there.\n\n**BOARD CHECK (from 10x10 grid at turn start):**\nGrid row 1: (0,1)=A, (1,1)=., (2,1)=T (my body), (3,1)=T (my body), (4,1)=T (my body), (5,1)=T (my body? Actually after moving RIGHT, (5,1) is now body, not head), (6,1)=1 (head), (7,1)=., (8,1)=., (9,1)=. So (6,1) is HEAD, (5,1) is body. Adjacent cells:\n- **UP (6,2):** Grid row 2: (0,2)=A, (1,2)=., (2,2)=., (3,2)=., (4,2)=., (5,2)=., (6,2)=., (7,2)=., (8,2)=., (9,2)=. So at x=6, y=2 is `.` (empty). Enemy body? Check enemy list: (6,2) not in enemy body. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN (6,0):** Grid row 0: (0,0)=., (1,0)=., (2,0)=., (3,0)=., (4,0)=., (5,0)=., (6,0)=., (7,0)=., (8,0)=., (9,0)=A. So at x=6, y=0 is `.` (empty). My body? (6,0) not in my body. Enemy body? No. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT (5,1):** My body! (5,1) is now part of my body after moving RIGHT. \u274c DEAD (hit own body).\n- **RIGHT (7,1):** Grid row 1: at x=7, y=1 is `.` (empty). Enemy body? No. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is death.\n\n**ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\n- LEFT = death (into own body).\n- All others are safe from immediate crash.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nNow, which move gives us the BEST path to eat apples and avoid traps while forcing the enemy into a bad spot?\n\n1. **DOWN to (6,0):**\n   - At bottom row (y=0). From here, we can go LEFT to (5,0) (empty), RIGHT to (7,0) (empty? (7,0)=.), UP back to (6,1) (which will be our body after move \u2013 death). So only LEFT or RIGHT as forward moves.\n   - Apple at (9,0) is 3 steps away via RIGHT. But we'd be trapped on the bottom edge with limited escape. Not ideal for hunting multiple apples. Could get boxed in by enemy if they move down later.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7,1):**\n   - Opens up MORE forward options: UP to (7,2) (empty? row 2 at x=7 is `.`), DOWN to (7,0) (empty), RIGHT to (8,1) (empty), LEFT back to (6,1) (death). So three forward paths.\n   - Moves us toward RIGHT-SIDE apples: (8,3) is 2 steps away: (7,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (8,3). Also (7,7) is reachable via upward path: (7,1) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 ... \u2192 (7,7). (6,9) is also close via (7,1) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 ... \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,9).\n   - Enemy is on left, so we're moving AWAY from them \u2013 safer! No immediate head-on risk. This gives us space to claim the right side cluster.\n\n3. **UP to (6,2):**\n   - Moves us to row 2. From there, we can go UP to (6,3) (empty? row 3 at x=6 is `.`? Actually row 3: `T T T T T . . . A .` \u2013 x=6 is `.`), LEFT to (5,2) (empty), RIGHT to (7,2) (empty), DOWN back to (6,1) (death). So three forward paths.\n   - Apple at (2,2) is close: (6,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2). That's 4 moves, but that area is near enemy territory (their body at (2,3), (3,3), etc.). Apple at (5,7) is straight up, but (5,4) is enemy body! So we\u2019d need to detour.\n   - Risk: enemy might move toward center. If we go UP, we\u2019re closer to their current head (1,6) and body. Potential future collision if they push right.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (2,6) has options: RIGHT to (3,6) (empty), UP to (2,7) (empty, and there's an apple there!), DOWN to (2,5) (empty), LEFT to (1,6) (body? (1,6) is their body, so death). They\u2019re likely to go RIGHT or UP to grab (2,7) apple. If they go UP, they might head toward (5,7) or (7,8). If we go RIGHT, we\u2019re moving away from that path. If we go UP, we might cross paths sooner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're behind 4 vs 9 \u2013 need apples FAST. Right side has a CLUSTER of 5+ apples! Left side has fewer and enemy is camping there. We should aggressively claim the right side, build length, and force enemy to cross the board if they want a fight. Avoid head-on unless we're ahead \u2013 we\u2019re NOT ahead, so we NEED to eat safely. Goal: get to (8,3) next, then (7,7) or (6,9). Build length to dominate space. If enemy moves right, we'll be ready to box them in.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **DOWN** = tight corridor, few apples, limited options.\n- **UP** = toward enemy territory, riskier potential collision.\n- **RIGHT** = opens right-side hunting grounds, away from enemy, multiple forward paths, best for apple access and long-term expansion.\n\n**CHOOOOOSE RIGHT!** We\u2019re going for the apple jackpot on the right!

Let's analyze the board after our last move RIGHT.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (7, 1) \u2013 just moved RIGHT from (6, 1)!\n- **My body:** [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)] \u2013 length 5. (Tail at (3,1) will move forward after this turn).\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head (3, 6), body: [(2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]. (Note: From the board, (4,3) seems to be body too, but the list ends at (3,3) \u2013 I'll trust the list, but the board shows 'T' at (4,3) in row 3. If the list is missing one, I need to be careful.)\n- **Apples:** (8,3) is our immediate target! Right-side cluster is still available.\n\n**BOARD CHECK (from 10x10 grid at turn start):**\nGrid row 1: (0,1)=A, (1,1)=., (2,1)=T (my body), (3,1)=T (my body), (4,1)=T (my body), (5,1)=T (my body), (6,1)=T (my body after move), (7,1)=1 (head), (8,1)=., (9,1)=. So (7,1) is HEAD. Adjacent cells:\n- **UP (7,2):** Grid row 2: (0,2)=A, (1,2)=., (2,2)=., (3,2)=., (4,2)=., (5,2)=., (6,2)=., (7,2)=., (8,2)=., (9,2)=. So (7,2) is `.` (empty). Enemy body? Check enemy list: (7,2) not in enemy body. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **DOWN (7,0):** Grid row 0: (0,0)=., (1,0)=., (2,0)=., (3,0)=., (4,0)=., (5,0)=., (6,0)=., (7,0)=., (8,0)=., (9,0)=A. So (7,0) is `.` (empty). My body? (7,0) not in my body. Enemy body? No. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **LEFT (6,1):** My body! (6,1) is now part of my body after moving RIGHT. \u274c DEAD (hit own body).\n- **RIGHT (8,1):** Grid row 1: at x=8, y=1 is `.` (empty). Enemy body? No. So EMPTY. \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nGoal: Reach (8,3) apple quickly! Path: (7,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (8,3). That's 3 moves. We need to choose the first step wisely.\n\n1. **DOWN to (7,0):**\n   - Ends at bottom edge. From there, we can only go LEFT (7,0) \u2192 (6,0) (empty), or RIGHT (7,0) \u2192 (8,0) (empty? (8,0) is '.'), or UP back to (7,1) (death after move). So limited forward options. Apple at (9,0) is 2 steps away via RIGHT. But if we go DOWN now, we delay getting to (8,3). Risky if enemy moves rightward toward us. Not ideal.\n\n2. **UP to (7,2):**\n   - Moves us closer to center. From (7,2), we can go UP to (7,3) (empty? row 3 at x=7 is '.'), LEFT to (6,2) (empty), RIGHT to (8,2) (empty), or DOWN back to (7,1) (death). Good options.\n   - Apple at (8,3) is 2 steps away: (7,2) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (8,3). Also, (7,7) is reachable via straight up. This moves us toward the right-side cluster while staying flexible. Enemy is on left, so we're safe from immediate head-on. This seems solid!\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,1):**\n   - Directly toward (8,3)! From (8,1), we can go UP to (8,2) (empty), RIGHT to (9,1) (empty? row 1 at x=9 is '.'), or DOWN to (8,0) (empty). LEFT back to (7,1) is death.\n   - This gets us to (8,2) next turn, then (8,3). Perfect! We're hunting aggressively. Enemy might move right, but they're far away (head at (3,6)). No collision risk this turn.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (3,6) has apples nearby: (2,7) is UP, (5,7) is RIGHT. They'll likely chase one of those. If they go RIGHT toward (5,7), they might approach the center, but we're on the right side. If we go RIGHT, we keep distance. If we go UP, we might cut them off later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe need to secure (8,3) ASAP, then grab (7,7) or (6,9). Build length to control the right side. Avoid left side until we're bigger. Force enemy to cross board if they want to fight. We're not winning on apples yet, but space control is key. If we outgrow them, we can trap them later.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **DOWN** = delays apple hunt, traps on edge.\n- **UP** = good, but one step slower to (8,3).\n- **RIGHT** = FASTEST path to (8,3) apple! Aggressive and efficient. We'll be at (8,1) ready to strike next turn.\n\n**CHOOOOOSE RIGHT!** Let's eat that apple and climb the scoreboard!\n\n**STREAM CHAT \u2013 MOVING RIGHT FOR THE KILL!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 RIGHT",

Let\u2019s analyze.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (8, 2) \u2013 just moved UP last turn! Good positioning.\n- **My body:** [(8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] \u2013 length 5. Tail at (5, 1) will move forward if we grow.\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head at (5, 6), body: [(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)] \u2013 length 9, apples: 9. He\u2019s on the left side, far from us.\n- **Apples:** (8, 3) is directly UP from our head! That\u2019s our prize. (7, 7), (6, 9) are also on right side.\n\n**BOARD CHECK (10x10 grid):**\nRow 2 (y=2): (8,2)=1 (HEAD), (7,2)=., (6,2)=., etc.\nAdjacent cells from (8,2):\n- **UP (8, 3):** Row 3: (8,3)=A (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). Enemy? No. My body? No (my body is at y=1). SAFE! Eating this gives us +1 apple and grows us. \ud83d\udcaa\n- **DOWN (8, 1):** My body! (8,1) is part of my tail (current head was at (8,1) last turn, but after we moved UP, the tail moves forward? Wait, need to simulate. Currently, body is [(8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)]. If we move DOWN, we\u2019d go to (8,1), which is currently occupied by our own body. That\u2019s immediate death. \u274c DEAD.\n- **LEFT (7, 2):** Row 2: (7,2)=. (empty). Enemy? No. My body? No. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT (9, 2):** Row 2: (9,2)=. (empty). Enemy? No. My body? No. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP (apple!), LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nGoal: Eat (8,3) apple to grow and chase the score! Enemy is far left, so we have time.\n\n1. **UP to (8, 3):**\n   - EAT THE APPLE! We grow to length 6, score becomes 5 apples. From (8,3), we can go UP to (8,4), LEFT to (7,3), RIGHT to (9,3), or DOWN to (8,2) (which will be our tail after growth, so safe). We\u2019re in the right-side cluster, dominating. Enemy might chase (5,7) or (2,7), but we\u2019re safe. Aggressive and efficient! \ud83d\udca5\n\n2. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n   - Moves to (7,2). From there, we can go UP (7,3) [empty], DOWN (7,1) [my body? (7,1) is currently my body\u2014wait, after move, my body shifts: old head (8,2) becomes part of body, tail (5,1) drops? Need to simulate: if I move LEFT, new head (7,2), body becomes [(8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1)], tail (5,1) gone. So (7,1) is now body. So DOWN to (7,1) would be into my own body\u2014death. So from (7,2), only UP and RIGHT are safe? Actually LEFT to (6,2) might be safe. But we\u2019re moving away from apple (8,3). Not optimal.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n   - Moves to (9,2). From there, UP (9,3), DOWN (9,1) [empty? (9,1) is empty], LEFT (8,2) [my old body]. But we\u2019re missing the apple! We\u2019re on the edge, limiting future moves. Enemy won\u2019t reach us quickly, but we\u2019re not growing.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy head at (5,6). Apples near him: (5,7) is UP, (2,7) is UP-LEFT, (4,2) is DOWN-LEFT. He might go UP to chase (5,7) or (2,7). If he goes RIGHT, he could approach center, but we\u2019re far right. No immediate collision risk. We need to grow to catch up in apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (8,3) now! Then from (8,3), go UP to (8,4) or hunt (7,7) or (6,9). Build length to 30 before he does. If we outgrow him, we can trap him against the wall. Play aggressive\u2014force him into tight spaces. Avoid left side until we\u2019re bigger. Score gap is closing! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**DECISION:**\n- UP is the only move that gives us an apple immediately and keeps options open.\n- LEFT and RIGHT are safe but waste the apple opportunity.\n\n**LET\u2019S GOOO!** Eating that apple to level up! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break down the board.\n\n**CURRENT STATE (from the display, translated to my perspective):**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (8, 3). Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]. Length: 6 (since I ate an apple last turn and grew). Tail: (5, 1).\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head at (6, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)]. Length: 10 (10 apples). They\u2019re stacked on the left edge, far from me.\n- **Apples nearby:** (8, 3) was just eaten? Wait\u2014last turn I moved UP from (8, 2) to (8, 3) and ate that apple, so it\u2019s gone. Current apples listed: (0,2), (2,7), (7,8), (9,0), (9,9), (5,7), (8,9), (7,7), (6,9), (2,8), (2,4), (4,2), (0,1), (8,6), (9,8). From my head at (8,3), reachable apples:\n  - (9,0): DOWN-RIGHT, but far.\n  - (8,6): UP 3, but might be contested.\n  - (7,7): UP-RIGHT, good target.\n  - (8,9): UP 6, top-right cluster.\n  - (7,8): UP 5, right side.\n  - (9,9): TOP-RIGHT CORNER, max value! We can claim the edge.\n- **Enemy threats:** Head at (6,6). They could go RIGHT to (7,6) toward the center, or UP to (6,7) to chase (5,7) or (6,9). No direct collision risk yet\u2014they\u2019re too far left.\n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (8, 3):**\n- **UP (8, 4):** From row 4 display: \". . A . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (8,4) is empty (dot). No enemy, no body. SAFE. Follow-ups: (8,5) [row 5: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (8,5) empty? Wait row 5 y=5: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" so (8,5) is empty], (9,4) possible.\n- **DOWN (8, 2):** My body! (8,2) is currently in my body list. After move, old head (8,3) becomes body, so (8,2) will still be occupied by my own body (the next segment). Moving into your own body is instant death. \u274c DEAD\u2014DO NOT.\n- **LEFT (7, 3):** Row 3: \". . . . . . . . 1 .\" Wait that\u2019s for y=3? From grid, y=3 row: \"T T . . . . . . 1 .\" Actually (7,3) is empty (dot). No enemy (enemy body at y=3 is (1,3) only). SAFE. Follow-ups: (7,4) empty, (6,3) empty.\n- **RIGHT (9, 3):** Row 3: \"(9,3)\" is not shown as occupied; dot. Empty. SAFE. Follow-ups: (9,2) empty, (9,4) empty.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nWe\u2019re on the right side, dominating the top-right corner. Enemy is stuck on the left\u2014they\u2019re a long snake (10 segments) trapped against the wall, making them vulnerable to boxing. Score gap is 5 apples vs 10\u2014we need apples, but more importantly, we need to claim space and force them into a bad spot.\n\n1. **UP to (8, 4):**\n   - Moves toward (8,6) apple and top edge. From (8,4), we can go UP to (8,5) [empty], LEFT to (7,4) [empty], RIGHT to (9,4) [empty], or DOWN back to (8,3) [which will be tail after growth? Not growing this turn, but safe]. This keeps options wide open and positions us to chase (8,6) or (7,7). Enemy unlikely to reach us here. Aggressive advance! \ud83d\ude80\n\n2. **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n   - Moves toward (7,7) apple and center. From (7,3), we can go UP to (7,4) [empty], RIGHT back to (8,3) [tail], DOWN to (7,2) [empty? Row 2: (7,2) is dot], or LEFT to (6,3) [empty]. Solid, but it pulls us left, closer to enemy territory if they move right. Risk of future collision if they push center.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n   - Hugs the right wall. From (9,3), we can go UP to (9,4) [empty], DOWN to (9,2) [empty], or LEFT to (8,3) [tail]. Limited on the right side\u2014only two main directions (up/down). Could trap us later if we go too far right without apples. (9,0) and (9,9) are far. Not ideal for growth.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 is at (6,6) with apples at (5,7) [UP], (2,7) [LEFT/UP], (6,9) [UP]. They\u2019re likely to go UP to chase (5,7) or (6,9) to grow. If they go RIGHT to (7,6), they enter the center but still far from us. No head-on collision risk this turn\u2014they\u2019re 13 cells away Manhattan distance. We stay safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the right/top! Push to (8,6) apple next turn, then aim for (7,7) or top-right corner (8,9)/(9,9). Build length to 20+ while the enemy\u2019s long body gets jammed on the left wall. If they come center, we flank and force a head-on when we\u2019re bigger. Avoid left side until we\u2019re ready to pounce. Stay alive, eat apples, win the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is best\u2014maintains aggression, keeps multiple paths open, and puts us on the edge for future trapping. LEFT pulls toward enemy, RIGHT limits us. UP keeps the pressure on!\n\nUP",

Time to close the gap and press the advantage on the right side!\n\n**BOARD STATE RECAP:**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (8, 4). Body: [(8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)]. Wait, the display says my head is (8,4) now? That means I just moved UP last turn and it's confirmed! So my body shifts: old head (8,4) becomes part of body? No, careful\u2014snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is head. So after moving UP to (8,4), my body is now [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1)], tail at (6,1). Length 6. Good.\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head at (7,6) per scoreboard! They moved RIGHT from (6,6) to (7,6). Body: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3)]. Length 10. They're creeping right into the center\u2014dangerous but we can counter.\n- **Apples:** Same list, but (8,4) is now empty (I ate it last turn? Wait no, last turn I moved to (8,3) and ate that? Rereading\u2014last turn rationale said I moved UP to (8,3) and ate apple there? But current board shows my head at (8,4) and no apple at (8,3)? Actually, from the board display: row 4 has \". . A . . . . . 1 .\" so (8,4) is \"1\" meaning head there, and no apple at (8,3) (it's \"A\" in row 2? No row 2 is y=2: \"A . . . A . . . T .\" So apples at (0,2), (4,2), etc. Anyway, focus on current: reachable apples from (8,4): (8,6) [UP 2], (7,7) [UP-RIGHT], (8,9) [UP 5], (7,8) [UP 4], (9,9) [corner]. Enemy at (7,6) might go for (5,7) or (6,9).\n- **Threats:** Enemy head (7,6) is only 2 cells away vertically from my head (8,4)? Manhattan distance: |8-7| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3. If they go RIGHT to (8,6) and I go UP to (8,5), no collision. But if both go to same cell? Possible if I go UP-RIGHT? No moves are cardinal. Risk of head-on if I go RIGHT to (9,4) and they go DOWN? Unlikely. They're likely to go UP or LEFT. We'll predict.\n\n**CHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (8,4):**\n- **UP to (8,5):** Row 5: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (8,5) is empty (dot). No body, no enemy. SAFE. Good position\u2014next to (8,6) apple.\n- **DOWN to (8,3):** My body! (8,3) is currently my second segment (after head). Moving into own body = death. \u274c DEAD.\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Row 4: (7,4) is empty (dot). No enemy (enemy body at y=4 is (0,4)). SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Row 4: (9,4) is empty (dot). No body, no enemy. SAFE. But hugs wall\u2014future option limited.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy is at (7,6), pushing right\u2014 they might chase (5,7) or (6,9) or even (8,6) if they go UP. If they go UP to (7,7), they could eat (7,7) apple. We need to block them! We're on the right, we own this side. Our body is vertical on x=8 and x=6/7, forming a partial barrier. If we go UP, we get closer to (8,6) and can cut off their access to top-right apples. If we go LEFT, we chase (7,7) but risk getting close to their head\u2014might set up a head-on if they come down. RIGHT is safe but passive.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (8,5):** Best! Advances toward (8,6) apple (eaten next turn), positions to dominate right column. From (8,5), we can go UP to (8,6) [apple], LEFT to (7,5) [empty], RIGHT to (9,5) [empty], or DOWN to (8,4) [tail]. Multiple paths, aggressive. If enemy goes UP to (7,7), we're ready to flank. If they go RIGHT to (8,6), head-on risk? Both could target (8,6) next turn\u2014we have advantage if we grow first? But simultaneous: if both move to same cell, both die. We'll avoid that by eating apple if possible. UP keeps us away from their body (no risk yet).\n2. **LEFT to (7,4):** Moves toward (7,7) but also toward enemy center. From (7,4), we can go UP to (7,5) [empty], RIGHT to (8,4) [tail], DOWN to (7,3) [empty], LEFT to (6,4) [empty? Row 4: (6,4) dot]. Safe, but closer to (7,6) enemy head\u2014 potential collision if they go DOWN to (7,5) and we go UP to (7,5) same turn? Possible but unlikely. Still, it pulls us left where enemy is stronger.\n3. **RIGHT to (9,4):** Wall-hugger. From (9,4), only UP to (9,5), DOWN to (9,3), LEFT to (8,4) [tail]. Limited. (9,0) and (9,9) are far\u2014no immediate apple. Passive, wastes potential to cut enemy off.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 at (7,6) with apples at (5,7) [UP-LEFT], (6,9) [UP], (7,7) [UP]. They'll likely go UP to chase (5,7) or (7,7) to grow. If they go RIGHT to (8,6), that's aggressive but risky for them (we might be there). Distance to us is 3 cells\u2014no immediate head-on this turn if we move smart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClaim the right edge! Push to (8,6) apple, then (9,9) corner. Our vertical body on x=8 blocks enemy from accessing top-right. Force them to stay left/center where their long body will trap them. When we have 10+ apples, we go for head-on collision to eliminate them. Until then, eat, grow, control space. Stay alive!\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is the move\u2014aggressive, opens paths, targets apple. LEFT brings us too close to enemy; RIGHT is too passive. Let's go!\n\nUP",

Last move UP to (8,5) was money\u2014now we're perched right below the (8,6) apple, ready to strike. Time to close the gap and keep the pressure on!\n\n**BOARD STATE RECAP:**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (8,5) now. Body: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (7,1)]. Tail at (7,1). Length 6. Perfect vertical block on the right.\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head at (8,6)?? Wait, hold up\u2014last turn they were at (7,6), and board shows row 6: \"T T T T T T T T 0 .\" That \"0\" at (8,6) means their head moved RIGHT into (8,6) and ate the apple there! Now their body is [(7,6), (6,6), ..., (0,3)] and they're at 12 apples. Damn, they grew! They're invading our turf.\n- **Apples:** (8,6) is gone (enemy ate it). Reachable from (8,5): UP to (8,6) [now empty, but enemy just left? No, their body is there now], (7,7) [UP-LEFT], (9,9) [UP-RIGHT 4], (7,8) [UP-RIGHT 3], (6,9) [UP-RIGHT 4]. (5,7) and others are further left.\n- **Threats:** Enemy head at (8,6) is DIRECTLY ABOVE US! Manhattan distance: 1 cell. If they move DOWN back to (8,5), we crash if we don't move. But they just ate and grew, so their tail didn't move (apples don't shrink them). They might chase (7,7) or (6,9) next. We're vulnerable to a head-on if we both target same cell. Their body snakes left from (7,6)\u2014we're safe from it for now.\n\n**CHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (8,5):**\n- **UP to (8,6):** Their head is there RIGHT NOW! We'd crash into enemy head = both die. \u274c DEAD (head-on collision).\n- **DOWN to (8,4):** My body! (8,4) is my second segment. Hitting own body = death. \u274c DEAD.\n- **LEFT to (7,5):** Row 5: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" \u2192 (7,5) is empty (dot). No enemy body (enemy at y=5 is (0,5)). SAFE. Good escape.\n- **RIGHT to (9,5):** Row 5: (9,5) is empty (dot). No body, no enemy. SAFE. Wall-hug but alive.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. UP and DOWN are suicide.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nEnemy stole our apple and is now blocking our upward path! They're at (8,6), likely eyeing (7,7) or (6,9) next. If we go LEFT to (7,5), we flank them toward (7,7) apple\u2014aggressive, but we get closer to their head (distance 2). If they go DOWN to (8,5), we could collide if we go UP? But we're not going UP. If they go LEFT to (7,6) [their body], they'd die? Wait, (7,6) is their own body segment now? Their body starts at (7,6), so moving LEFT into their own body would kill them. They might not do that. They'll probably go UP or RIGHT to escape their body's tail. RIGHT to (9,6) is possible but wall-limited. UP to (7,7) is smart for them. We need to cut them off!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,5), we're safe but passive\u2014hugging wall, fewer options (only UP, DOWN, LEFT). From (7,5), we have UP to (7,6) [enemy body, but it's their segment\u2014would they die if we move there? No, we can't move into any snake's body. (7,6) is enemy body, so we can't go there. But from (7,5): UP to (7,6) [enemy body, blocked], DOWN to (7,4) [empty], LEFT to (6,5) [empty], RIGHT to (8,5) [our tail? No, our head is moving, tail might shift, but (8,5) will be empty after we leave]. Actually, tail moves only if we don't eat. So from (7,5), multiple safe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (back to (8,5) if safe). LEFT keeps us mobile and away from walls.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey're at (8,6) with apple just eaten. Their body is long (10 segments). They won't risk moving into their own body (LEFT to (7,6)). They'll chase the next apple: probably UP to (7,7) [apple at (7,7)] or maybe RIGHT to (9,6) [wall]. If they go UP to (7,7), they grow again. If they go DOWN to (8,5), that's our spot\u2014head-on collision if we stay? But we're moving. Let's avoid that.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're boxed in on the right, but our body is a wall. Go LEFT to reclaim the center and flank the enemy. From (7,5), we can chase (7,7) or (6,9) while keeping an eye on their long body. Eat apples to grow faster than them. When we hit 10+ apples, we can force a head-on where we win (we're at 5, they're at 12\u2014 we need to catch up). Stay alive, avoid their tail, and trap them in the left-bottom corner eventually. Plan: LEFT now, then UP to (7,6) if safe? Wait, (7,6) is their body\u2014blocked. So maybe LEFT to (6,5) next to cut off (5,7). Let's play it cool.\n\n**DECISION:**\nUP is death, DOWN is death. RIGHT is safe but we lose ground to enemy. LEFT is aggressive, opens paths to apples and flanks the enemy. Let's move LEFT and show them who owns this board!\n\nLEFT",

Now they're at (8,7) after moving UP (I think? Board shows \"0\" at (7,7) on row 7? Wait, board shows row 7: \". . A . . A . A 0 .\" So (8,7) is empty, (7,7) is apple? No, \"A\" at (2,7) and (7,7)? Actually row 7: positions: 0:\".\", 1:\".\", 2:\"A\", 3:\".\", 4:\".\", 5:\"A\", 6:\".\", 7:\"A\", 8:\"0\", 9:\".\" So Snake #0 head is at (8,7), body likely snakes from (8,6) down. They ate (8,6) last turn, now chasing (7,7)? They might go LEFT to (7,7) next to eat that apple. We're at (7,5) with body [(8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)], length 6. Apples: 5 vs their 12. We need to grow and trap them!\n\n**BOARD STATE RECAP:**\n- **My snake (ID 1):** Head at (7,5). Body vertical on the right from (8,5) to (8,1). Tail at (8,1). Length 6. We're in the center-right, flexible!\n- **Enemy snake #0:** Head at (8,7). Body: [(8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,5), (0,4)] (from board row 6 full of \"T\"). Apples: 12. They're a long vertical line on the left, head at (8,7) \u2013 they're invading the top-right!\n- **Apples near us:** (7,7) [UP-RIGHT 2], (6,9) [UP-LEFT 2? Wait from (7,5): (6,9) is dx=-1, dy=4], (5,7) [LEFT-UP 2], (9,9) [RIGHT-UP 4], (7,8) [UP-RIGHT 3], (6,5) [LEFT]. (6,5) is empty now (last turn board had \"A\" at (6,5)? No, apple drops list (6,5) but not on current board? Current row 5: \"T . . . . . A . . .\" so (6,5) is empty dot. (7,7) is apple (A). (6,9) apple. We can grab (6,5) or (7,7) if we move smart.\n- **Threats:** Enemy head at (8,7) is 2 cells away (Manhattan distance 3? From (7,5) to (8,7): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 3). If they move LEFT to (7,7) to eat apple, they'll grow. If we go UP to (7,6), that's enemy body (their segment at (7,6)? From body list: (7,6) is part of their body \u2013 yes, they have (7,6) as second segment. So UP is blocked. If we go RIGHT to (8,5), that's our body (second segment). Blocked. DOWN to (7,4): row 4 is \"T . A . . . . . . .\" so (7,4) is empty? Row 4 positions: 7 is \".\" (since 0:T,1:.,2:A,...). Yes (7,4) empty. LEFT to (6,5): empty. So only DOWN and LEFT are safe? Wait, let's verify all.\n\n**CHECK SAFE MOVES FROM (7,5):**\n- **UP to (7,6):** Enemy body! Snake #0 has (7,6) in its body. We'd crash into their body = death. \u274c DEAD.\n- **DOWN to (7,4):** Empty (dot on board row 4). No own body (our body is at x=8). No enemy (enemy at y=6+). SAFE. \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,5):** Empty (dot on row 5). No own body. No enemy (enemy at y=6+). SAFE. \u2705\n- **RIGHT to (8,5):** Our own body! Second segment. Hitting ourselves = death. \u274c DEAD.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (7,4), LEFT to (6,5). UP and RIGHT are suicide.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- **LEFT to (6,5):** Moves us closer to the center, positions us to chase apple at (6,9) [UP 4] or (5,7) [LEFT-UP 2]. Also flanks enemy body \u2013 from (6,5), we're near their vertical line on y=6. If they go LEFT to (7,7) to eat, we could go UP next to block (6,6) or chase (6,9). But (6,6) is enemy body? Their body has (6,6) \u2013 yes, so can't go there. From (6,5), safe follow-ups: UP to (6,6) [enemy, blocked], DOWN to (6,4) [empty], LEFT to (5,5) [empty], RIGHT to (7,5) [our current spot, will be empty after move]. So 3 safe options next turn \u2013 great mobility. This also avoids walls; we're not boxed in.\n- **DOWN to (7,4):** Moves us away from enemy, deeper into the center. Apples nearby: (7,7) [UP 3], (6,5) [LEFT 1], (4,2) [LEFT-DOWN 2]. From (7,4), follow-ups: UP to (7,5) [empty after move], DOWN to (7,3) [empty? Row 3: all dots except (8,3) is our body? Wait row 3: \". . . . . . . . T .\" so (7,3) empty], LEFT to (6,4) [empty], RIGHT to (8,4) [our body]. So 3 safe options. But it's more passive \u2013 we're moving away from the action, letting enemy eat (7,7) and grow to 13. We need to be aggressive!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThey're at (8,7), likely eyeing (7,7) apple (right next to them). If they move LEFT to (7,7), they eat and grow. Their tail is at (0,4), so they don't shrink. If we go LEFT to (6,5), we're cutting toward that apple too \u2013 distance to (7,7) is 2 (UP-RIGHT). If they go DOWN to (8,6) (their body), they'd die \u2013 unlikely. They might go UP to (8,8) but that's empty dot? Row 8: \". . A . . . . A . A\" so (8,8) empty. But (7,7) is closer and has apple. I predict they eat (7,7).\n\nIf we go DOWN, we retreat and they eat freely, widening the gap (13 vs 5). If we go LEFT, we position to contest apples and potentially force a head-on later when we grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe're at 5 apples vs 12 \u2013 HUGE deficit. We must eat apples FAST and grow while boxing them in. Their body is a long line on the left; we can use our right-side body to cut off the top-right. From (6,5), next move UP to (6,6) is blocked, so go LEFT to (5,5) or UP to (5,6) if safe? Wait (5,6) is enemy body? Their body has (5,6) \u2013 yes, so avoid. Better to go UP to (6,5) -> (6,6) blocked, so LEFT to (5,5) to get closer to (5,7) apple. Then UP to (5,6) if enemy tail moves? Actually enemy tail moves when they grow, but they might not. Plan: LEFT now to flank, then UP to (6,5)? Wait no, from (6,5) we can go UP to (6,6) blocked, so LEFT to (5,5) or DOWN to (6,4). Let's chase (5,7) or (6,9). Grow, grow, grow. When we hit 10+ apples, we can force a head-on collision in the center and win with higher score. Avoid walls, keep multiple paths open. Trap them in bottom-left eventually.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT is more aggressive and keeps us in the fight \u2013 we need to eat apples to close the score gap. DOWN is too passive and lets the enemy dominate. Let's move LEFT and show them we're not backing down!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break this down LIVE.\n\n**TURN 24 ANALYSIS \u2013 TIME TO LOCK IN!**  \nLast move: we went LEFT to (7,5). Now at (7,5), body behind us at (8,5) to (8,1). Enemy at (8,8) (snake #0 head). Their body stretches left along y=6, from (8,6) down to (0,5). They\u2019re longer, but we\u2019re scrappy!\n\n**BOARD SNAPSHOT (FROM YOUR POV):**  \n- **Apple clusters:** (7,7) UP-RIGHT from us (dx=0, dy=2), (6,9) UP-LEFT (dx=-1, dy=4), (5,7) LEFT-UP (dx=-2, dy=2), (9,9) TOP-CORNER, (6,5) LEFT (but empty now).  \n- **Threats:** Enemy head at (8,8) is hunting apples like (7,7) or (9,9). Their body blocks y=6 completely\u2014can\u2019t go UP from our current spot without crashing.  \n- **Our safety check from (7,5):**  \n  - **UP (7,6):** Enemy body! DEAD. \u274c  \n  - **DOWN (7,4):** Empty. Safe! \u2705  \n  - **LEFT (6,5):** Empty. Safe! \u2705  \n  - **RIGHT (8,5):** Our own body! DEAD. \u274c  \n  \u2192 Only safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC CALL \u2013 WHY LEFT OVER DOWN:**  \n1. **Aggression:** We\u2019re down 6 apples (11-6). Sitting back (DOWN) lets enemy feast on (7,7) and grow to 12. We NEED to close the gap.  \n2. **Positioning:** LEFT to (6,5) puts us closer to multiple apples\u2014(5,7) and (6,9). From there, we can zigzag upward and flank their vertical line.  \n3. **Mobility:** From (6,5), next moves open up\u2014DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), or RIGHT back to (7,5). Down traps us in the center with fewer apple options.  \n4. **Pressure:** Enemy might go LEFT to (7,7) to eat. If we go LEFT now, we contest that space and force them to think twice. If they go for (9,9), we\u2019re already closer.  \n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**  \nWe\u2019re building a \u201cright-side fortress\u201d with our body at x=8. Keep growing, then push upward to cut off the top-right from them. When we hit 10+ apples, we hunt a head-on collision in the open center\u2014our length advantage will guarantee we win the trade.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- DOWN is safe but passive\u2014enemy eats, we lose momentum.  \n- LEFT keeps us in the fight\u2014risky? Maybe, but we\u2019ve calculated: if enemy moves UP or RIGHT, they miss (7,7). If they LEFT to (7,7), we\u2019re one step closer to countering.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nLet\u2019s move LEFT and OWN the center! We\u2019re not dying today\u2014WE\u2019RE WINNING. \ud83d\udcaf  \n\nLEFT",

None of those intersect with (7,8), (8,9) or (9,8), so a head\u2011on collision is off the table for now.  \n\n**Strategic grab:** Snagging the (7,8) apple now not only adds a point but also positions us to chase the (7,7) apple on the next turn while keeping multiple safe routes open.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **Long\u2011term vision:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Eat (7,8) \u2192 grow to 12 apples.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn slide DOWN to (7,7) for the second apple, then swing LEFT/RIGHT to keep the pressure on the rival.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the enemy hemmed near their tail while we climb the wall and force a head\u2011on when we have the score edge.  \n\nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

DEAD \u274c  \n\u2192 Only safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**SCORE GAP:** Enemy has 12 apples, I have 6. They\u2019re DOUBLE my length! If I play passive, they\u2019ll snowball. I need to close the gap FAST or force a collision.  \n\n**BOARD DYNAMICS:**  \n- Enemy head at (7,8).

DEAD \u274c  \n- **DOWN (4,4):** Empty. Safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT (3,5):** Empty. Safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT (5,5):** My own body. DEAD \u274c  \n\u2192 Only safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**SCORE GAP:** Enemy 12 apples vs. my 6. DOUBLE THE LENGTH. I need to close this gap AGGRESSIVELY. They\u2019re at (6,8) \u2013 likely eyeing the apple cluster at (7,7), (9,9), etc.  \n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**  \n- **DOWN (4,4):** Safe, but passive. Leads to lower board where apples are scarce (only (4,2) and (2,4) nearby). Might trap me in a dead end.  \n- **LEFT (3,5):** Safe, opens up LEFT/UP/DOWN from (3,5). Moves me toward the center-left, closer to apples at (2,4), (2,8), and (0,2). Also flanks the enemy\u2019s vertical body at y=6.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CALL \u2013 LEFT TO (3,5):**  \n1. **AGGRESSION:** LEFT pushes toward the enemy\u2019s \u201cterritory\u201d (their body spans x=0 to x=8 at y=6). From (3,5), I can potentially UP to (3,6) next turn to threaten a head-on collision if they move down.  \n2. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3,5), I have three safe exits: DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5), or UP to (3,6) if they vacate. DOWN is too limited.  \n3. **PSYCHOLOGY:** Enemy expects me to cower DOWN. Surprise them by pushing LEFT, contesting the apple at (2,4) and pressuring their flank.  \n4. **LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n   - **Turn 27:** If enemy moves DOWN to (7,7) (likely), I\u2019ll go UP from (3,5) to (3,6) to cut them off.  \n   - **Turn 28-30:** Build a \u201cwall\u201d at x=3/y=6, boxing them into the top-right corner. Force them into a collision while I eat apples to grow.  \n   - **Win condition:** Level the apple count and force a head-on collision when I\u2019m at 9+ apples. My length will crush theirs.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **LEFT (3,5):** Immediate safety + future flexibility. Low risk of trapping myself.  \n- **DOWN (4,4):** Short-term safety but long-term isolation. Enemy grows unchecked.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT.

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT!** Turn 28 \u2013 time to tighten the trap on snake #0! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (Current Head: (2, 5)):**\n- **UP (2, 6):** Enemy body (part of the long vertical line). DEAD \u274c  \n- **DOWN (2, 4):** **APPLE AT (2, 4)!** \u2705  \n- **LEFT (1, 5):** Empty. Safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT (3, 5):** My own body (tail segment just left behind). DEAD \u274c  \n\n**SCORE GAP:** 6 apples vs. 13. Need to eat to grow and close the gap for potential head-on collisions.  \n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**  \n- **UP:** Immediate death into enemy body. NO GO.  \n- **DOWN:** Moves to **apple (2, 4)**. This grows me to 7 apples. It\u2019s also a key step in boxing snake #0 into the top-right corner. From (2, 4), I can move LEFT to (1, 4) or UP to (2, 5) (but that\u2019s moving back).  \n- **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe, but no apple. Moves me westward, potentially cutting off enemy access from the left. However, I can still reach the apple next turn from here (LEFT to (1, 5) \u2192 DOWN to (1, 4) \u2192 DOWN to (1, 3) etc.).  \n- **RIGHT:** Death. NO.  \n\n**STRATEGIC CALL \u2013 DOWN TO (2, 4):**  \n1. **AGGRESSION & GROWTH:** Grab the apple! Every point counts. I need to reach 9+ apples to challenge snake #0 in a head-on collision.  \n2. **POSITIONING:** Moving DOWN to (2, 4) puts me directly below their vertical body at (2, 6). If they try to move DOWN further (to (7, 7)), I can flank them.  \n3. **BLOCKING OPPORTUNITY:** From (2, 4), I can move LEFT (1, 4) or DOWN (2, 3) to set up a wall. I\u2019ve already planned to build a wall at x=2-3 \u2013 starting NOW.  \n4. **RISK:** Minimal. The only threat is if snake #0 moves HEAD to (2, 4) simultaneously \u2013 but they\u2019re at (7, 9) and need two moves to get there. Their body blocks UP, so they likely go DOWN or RIGHT.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (SELF-NOTE):**  \n- **Turn 28:** DOWN to (2, 4) \u2013 **EAT APPLE!** (Score: 7)  \n- **Turn 29:** LEFT to (1, 4) \u2013 secure position west of their body.  \n- **Turn 30:** DOWN to (1, 3) \u2013 start building a wall under their vertical line.  \n- **Goal:** Cut off their escape to the left/bottom, force them into the top-right corner where I can ambush. Wait for them to be trapped, then go for a head-on collision when I\u2019m at 9+ apples.  \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**  \n- **DOWN (2, 4):** Safe (no immediate threats), **GROWTH**, and **POSITIONING**. High reward, low risk.  \n- **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe but passive. Doesn\u2019t secure the apple or advance the trap.  \n\n**DECISION:**  \nDOWN. We eat, we grow, we dominate! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc80  \n\nDOWN",

Safe for now.\n- **Body:** Running vertically down the right side (x=8,7,6...) and then across y=6.\n- **Strategy:** They are trapped in the right quadrant. I need to close the left side of their cage.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (1, 5):** Moves me into the row above. Risk: The enemy body is at (1, 6). If I go UP, I'm getting closer to their vertical line at x=1. I want to box them in, not join them.\n- **DOWN (1, 3):** Moves me deeper into the cage building. Risk: None immediately.

They cannot cross my body.\n2. **CAGE DIMENSIONS:** If I go LEFT, I am at (0,4). The enemy is at (9,9). The gap is huge. I need to start narrowing it.\n3. **SAFETY:** DOWN is tempting to go lower, but LEFT guarantees I am not stepping into the enemy's reach for a turn or two.\n4. **FUTURE PLANS:** From (0, 4), I can go DOWN to (0, 3) to seal the corner, or UP to (0, 5). Both are safe.\n\n**SELF-NOTE (Next Turn Strategy):**\n- **Turn 30:** LEFT to (0, 4) \u2013 Secure the left wall.\n- **Turn 31:** DOWN to (0, 3) \u2013 Seal the bottom-left corner.\n- **Goal:** Create a barrier from (0,0) to (0,9) if possible, or force the enemy into the top-right 2x2 block (8,8)-(9,9). Once they are cornered and I have more apples, I go for the head hunt.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am trapped if I go RIGHT. I am safe in all other directions. To maximize the trap, I need to own the left edge. **LEFT** is the play.\n\nLEFT",

The segment at (0, 6) is currently my tail (one of the coordinates listed in my body list: `(2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)`... wait, looking at my body list: `[(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]`.\n    *   Wait, looking closely at the body list provided: `(0, 4)` is the second element. `(0, 5)` is the head. The tail is `(5, 5)`.\n    *   However, the board display shows `T` at (0, 6).\n    *   Let's look at the board again:\n        `5 1 A T T T T . . . .`\n    *   The `T`'s on row 5 are at x=2, 3, 4, 5.\n    *   Let's look at row 6:\n        `6 . .

Let's check the diagram again.\n    *   Row 6: `. . T T T T T T T .`\n    *   Row 5: `1 A T T T T . . . .`\n    *   Row 4: `T T T . . . . . . .`\n    *   Wait, `(0, 6)` is the first column of row 6.

T T T T T T T .`\n    *   Column 0, Row 6 is `.`\n    *   So `(0, 6)` is Empty.\n    *   **Wait**, I need to check my body coordinates again.\n    *   My body: `(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)`.\n    *   I do **not** have a segment at `(0, 6)`.\n    *   Therefore, **UP to (0, 6)** is SAFE.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 4):**\n    *   Is it safe?

The board shows `.` at `(1, 5)`.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy? Enemy is at (9,7). No.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE. \u2705\n\n**Decision:**\nI must choose between **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Analysis of UP (0, 6):**\n    *   Keeps me on the left wall.\n    *   Connects to my body at (0, 5) -> (0, 6).\n    *   My tail is at (5, 5). This move doesn't help me close the gap on the enemy immediately, but it maintains my position.\n    *   However, looking at the board, I see apples at (0, 2) and (0, 1). Moving UP moves me *away* from the apples on the bottom left.\n\n*   **Analysis of RIGHT (1, 5):**\n    *   Moves me off the wall into the interior.\n    *   Current Head (0, 5) -> New Head (1, 5).\n    *   Is (1, 5) safe? Yes.\n    *   Is (1, 5) an apple? The board shows `.`.\n    *   Strategic value: I have apples at (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (4, 9), (3, 9), (1, 5) is actually empty.\n    *   Wait, looking at the board row 5: `5 1 A T T T T . . . .`\n    *   (1, 5) is an `A` (Apple).\n    *   Let me re-read the board.\n    *   Row 5: `1 A T T T T . . . .`\n    *   (0, 5) is `1` (Me).\n    *   (1, 5) is `A` (Apple).\n    *   (2, 5) is `T` (My body).\n    *   So moving **RIGHT** allows me to **EAT AN APPLE**.\n\n**Score Check:**\nMe: 7 Apples.\nEnemy: 16 Apples.\nI am far behind. I need points. Eating an apple is +1 point and I grow. This allows me to extend my tail, potentially blocking the enemy more effectively later.\n\n**Collision Check for RIGHT:**\nHead moves to (1, 5). This is an Apple.\nSimultaneously, Enemy moves.\nEnemy Head is at (9, 7).\nPossible Enemy moves: Left (8,7), Down (9,6), Up (9,8), Right (10,7 - death).\nIf Enemy moves Left to (8,7), is (8,7) safe? Row 7: `7 . . A A . A . A T 0`. (8, 7) is `A` (Apple). Safe.\nIf Enemy moves Down to (9, 6). Row 6: `6 . . T T T T T T T .`. (9, 6) is `.`. Safe.\nEnemy will likely move to an apple or safer space.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1, 5) (Apple):\nI grow.\nMy tail stays at (5, 5) for this turn.\nNext turn my body will be: (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 6) (Empty):\nI do not grow.\nMy tail moves forward (if I don't eat).\nNext turn my body will be: (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n*   **RIGHT** gets me a point (7 -> 8). It puts me closer to the center/top where the density of apples seems higher (rows 7-9 have many apples). It opens up the path to the top-right where the enemy is trapped. It keeps my \"wall\" on the left side intact (since (0,4) and (0,5) remain part of my body).\n*   **UP** keeps me on the wall but denies me a point. Moving to (0, 6) puts me in a position where I might need to turn back down soon to loop around, or I risk trapping myself against the top wall (9,6).\n\n**Aggression & Strategy:**\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-right. I have 7 apples, he has 16. I am losing. I need to close the gap.\nMoving **RIGHT** to eat the apple increases my score and gives me a longer body. A longer body is better for boxing in the enemy. I can use my length to control the center lanes.\nIf I stay on the wall (UP), I am not threatening the enemy's space directly. I need to push forward.\nAlso, note the apple at (1, 5) is directly adjacent to my head. It's free points.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nIs (1, 5) safe from the enemy?\nEnemy is at (9, 7). The Manhattan distance is huge. He cannot reach me in one turn.\nIs (1, 5) safe from my own body?\n(1, 5) is currently empty on the board (Wait, I saw `A`).\nLet me check the board again.\n`5 1 A T T T T . . . .`\nIndex 0: '1' (Me at 0,5)\nIndex 1: 'A' (Apple at 1,5)\nIndex 2: 'T' (Body at 2,5)\nYes, (1, 5) is an Apple. It is NOT my body.\nMy body is at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5)...\n(1, 5) is empty space containing an apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nGo **RIGHT** to eat the apple.\nThis is the only move that allows me to score.\nMoving UP puts me in a defensive position on the wall, but I am already losing 7 to 16. I need to be aggressive and take points where I can find them to try to catch up.\n\nWait, looking at the board again...\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 5), I am eating the apple.\nNext turn, my head is at (1, 5).\nMy body occupies (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)...\nFrom (1, 5), my options next turn will be:\nUp (1, 6) -> Is it safe? Board: Row 6 col 1 is `.`.\nDown (1, 4) -> Is it safe? Board shows `T`. My body is there. **DEATH**.\nLeft (0, 5) -> Is it safe? My previous head position. **DEATH** (if I didn't grow enough, but usually it's safe if the tail moves... wait, moving into the spot the tail just left is safe, but moving into the body is not. (0,5) is occupied by my body *now*. If I move right, (0,5) becomes part of my body permanently until the tail leaves. Actually, (0,5) will be the second segment. So (0,5) is NOT safe to return to immediately).\nRight (2, 5) -> Is it safe? Board shows `T` (My body at 2,5). **DEATH**.\n\nSo, if I move **RIGHT** to (1, 5), I am in a very tight spot for Turn 33.\nI will be at (1, 5).\nMy body will loop behind me: (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)...\nThe only way out is **UP to (1, 6)**.\nIs (1, 6) safe?\nBoard Row 6: `. . T T T T T T T .`\n(1, 6) is `.` (Empty).\nSo I can go UP.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (0, 6)...\nMy head is at (0, 6).\nNext turn options:\nDown (0, 5) -> My body.\nRight (1, 6) -> Empty? Row 6 col 1 is `.`. Yes.\nLeft (-1, 6) -> Death.\nUp (0, 7) -> Row 7 col 0 is `.`.\n\nSo both moves keep me alive.\nHowever, **RIGHT** gets me a point.\n**RIGHT** also moves me towards the enemy's side of the board (Center X=1 vs X=0).\n**RIGHT** allows me to cut off the bottom-left area (which has apples at (0,2), (0,1)) but I can come back for them.\n\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (1, 5), I eat the apple.\nIf I go UP to (0, 6), I don't.\nI need points. I am down 7-16.\n\nLet's re-verify the \"Death by backward move\" rule.\n\"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself.\"\nIf I am at (0, 5) and I move RIGHT to (1, 5), my old position (0, 5) becomes part of my body.\nNext turn, if I try to move LEFT back to (0, 5), I hit my body. Correct.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTake the apple at (1, 5). Then go UP to (1, 6).\nThis pushes me towards the center. The enemy is at (9, 7). I need to apply pressure.\n\nOne detail: The board shows an apple at (2, 7). If I go RIGHT then UP, I am at (1, 6). From there I can go RIGHT to (2, 6) or UP to (1, 7) or RIGHT/UP to (2, 7).\nThis seems like a good path to chase points and intercept the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (9, 7). He is likely to move Left to (8, 7) (which is an apple) or Down to (9, 6).\nIf he moves Left, he stays in the top right.\nI am securing the left-center.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to eat the apple. It's the only way to gain points right now.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 5: `5 1 A T T T T . . . .`\nThe apple is at (1, 5).\nMy head is at (0, 5).\nMoving Right is safe.\n\nOne check: Is there any risk of the enemy crashing into me?\nEnemy is at (9, 7). He has a body at (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)... all the way to (2, 6).\nMy body is on the left (0, 4), (1, 4)...\nCollision is impossible this turn.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the winning move for points.\n\nFinal check on the \"Trap\" logic from last turn.\nLast turn I moved UP to (0, 5).\nThe plan was to box him in.\nTo box him in, I need to take space.\n(1, 5) is space.\n(0, 6) is also space, but it's \"dead end\" space on the wall. (1, 5) connects to (1, 6), which connects to (2, 6)...\n(2, 6) is part of the enemy's body!\nWait.\nIf I go RIGHT (1, 5) -> UP (1, 6) -> RIGHT (2, 6)...\n(2, 6) is part of Snake #0's body.\nIf I move into (2, 6), I die.\nSo I cannot go past (1, 6) to the right easily.\nBut I can go UP from (1, 6) to (1, 7).\n(1, 7) is empty? Row 7: `7 . . A A . A . A T 0`\n(1, 7) is `.`.\nSo I can go UP.\n\nSo the path is:\nTurn 32: RIGHT (1, 5) - Eat Apple.\nTurn 33: UP (1, 6).\nTurn 34: UP (1, 7).\nFrom (1, 7), I can go RIGHT to (2, 7) which is an Apple.\nOr I can go UP to (1, 8).\n(1, 8) is empty? Row 8: `8 . . A . . . T T T T`. (1, 8) is `.`.\nThis seems like a valid aggressive path.\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 6):\nTurn 33: Right (1, 6).\nTurn 34: Right (2, 6) -> DEATH (Enemy body).\nSo going UP limits my rightward movement because I hit the enemy's body at (2, 6).\nActually, if I go UP to (0, 6), I can go UP to (0, 7).\n(0, 7) is empty? Row 7 col 0 is `.`.\nThen I can go RIGHT to (1, 7).\nThis is also valid.\n\nBut going RIGHT to (1, 5) gives me an apple *now*.\nGoing UP to (0, 6) gives me nothing now.\n\nI'll take the apple.\n\nCHAT, LET'S EAT!\n\nOne final check:\n(1, 5) is an Apple.\nMy head is (0, 5).\nRight is safe.\nUp is safe.\nDown is death.\nLeft is death.\nI choose Right.\n\nNext move will likely be UP to (1, 6).\nFrom (1, 6), I am safe to go UP to (1, 7).\nFrom (1, 7), I can eat the apple at (2, 7).\nThis puts me closer to the top-right corner where the enemy is trapped.\nI will use my growing body to block his escape routes.\n\nLet's move.\n\nRIGHT",

My tail is at (5, 5), so I have room to grow eventually, but right now I have to push forward.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n*   **Immediate Move:** UP to (1, 6). This moves me closer to the top of the board where the apples are clustered.\n*   **Long-term Plan:** From (1, 6), I can look to move UP to (1, 7) or potentially RIGHT to (2, 6)...\n    *   **WAIT.** (2, 6) is currently occupied by Snake #0's body (checking the list: (2, 6) is not explicitly listed in the body, but let's check the board again).\n    *   Row 6: `6 . .

Wait, (2, 6) is NOT in the body list provided.\n    *   Let's look at the board output again.\n    *   `6 . . T T T T T T T 0`\n    *   The dots are (0,6) and (1,6).\n    *   The T's start at (2,6) through (8,6).\n    *   The 0 is (9,6).\n    *   The body list ends at (3, 6).\n    *   **CRITICAL:** The board visualization shows `(2, 6)` as a `T`, but the opponent's body list provided does not include `(2, 6)`. It ends at `(3, 6)`.\n    *   **Rule Check:** \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\n    *   Opponent Body: `[(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]`\n    *   The tail is at (3, 6).\n    *   Therefore, `(2, 6)` is technically **FREE SPACE** (or an apple).\n    *   Looking at Row 6 on the board: `6 . . T T T T T T T 0`\n    *   This is a discrepancy between the text list and the grid.\n    *   **Trust the list.** The list is the source of truth for movement logic.\n    *   If I move UP to (1, 6), I am safe.\n    *   From (1, 6), if I move RIGHT to (2, 6), I am moving into a space that *should* be empty (since the tail is at 3,6) or possibly an apple (though the board shows T).\n    *   *However*, if the board is right and the list is wrong, I die.\n    *   Given I am forced UP, I will deal with (2, 6) next turn.\n    *   Let's look for apples.\n    *   (2, 7) is an apple.\n    *   (1, 6) is empty.\n    *   (1, 7) is empty.\n\n**FINAL PLAN:**\n1.  Move **UP** to (1, 6) to survive and gain ground.\n2.  Next turn, assess (2, 6). If the list is correct, (2, 6) is open.\n3.  Target the apple at (2, 7) or (2, 8).\n\nThe enemy is still far away.

We are still in the game but we are on the ropes! \ud83d\ude24 We are neck-and-neck on apples (8 vs 16), but that opponent is a HUGE threat hanging out on the right side of the board. We need to move carefully. Let's break down the board state.\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 34):**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 6)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n*   **Opponent Head:** (9, 5) - *He just moved DOWN from (9, 6) last turn.*\n*   **Opponent Body:** [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\n    *   *Note: The board grid shows a `T` at (2, 6), but the body list ends at (4, 6). I will trust the list for movement logic, but visually it looks like the enemy body extends to (2, 6). I must be cautious.*\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (1, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** It's empty. I don't collide with my body (my body is at y=5 and below).\n    *   **Strategy:** This pushes me deeper into the top-left quadrant where the apples are clustering ((2, 7), (2, 8), (0, 2)). It keeps me away from the enemy who is on the far right.\n    *   **Future:** From (1, 7), I can go UP to (1, 8), LEFT to (0, 7), or potentially DOWN (if I want to loop back, though risky). It opens up the board.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE & STRATEGIC.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):**\n    *   **Board:** `T` (My Body - the neck)\n    *   **Safety:** This is moving backwards into my own body. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **Verdict: ILLEGAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 6):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** It's empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the absolute left wall.\n    *   **Future:** From (0, 6), I can go UP to (0, 7) or DOWN to (0, 5) (which is my body, so death). If I go UP, I'm safe. If I go RIGHT, I go back to (1, 6).\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE, but slightly more restrictive than UP.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n    *   **Board:** `T` (Visual T on grid, but list ends at (4, 6))\n    *   **Safety:** If the list is correct, (2, 6) is empty. If the grid is correct (enemy body extends here), it's death.\n    *   **Risk:** Even if safe, moving RIGHT brings me closer to the opponent's territory. The opponent is at (9, 5), but his body trails up the right side and across the top.\n    *   **Verdict: RISKY.** I don't want to weave through the enemy's body if I can avoid it.\n\n**DECISION:**\nChat, we have to play the long game. The opponent is currently moving DOWN towards the bottom-right apples. He is hunting. I am currently trapped in a small space (1,6). I need to expand my territory immediately.\n\n**UP to (1, 7)** is the move. It moves me away from the immediate danger of my own tail and positions me to grab the apple at (2, 7) or (2, 8) on subsequent turns. It also keeps me on the left side of the map, away from the enemy's massive body on the right. We need to start eating to catch up to that 16 apple lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (1, 7), I will look to secure the apples in the top-left corner (specifically (2, 7) and (2, 8)). I need to grow my length to defend against a potential late-game clash. If the enemy comes hunting, I want to have a longer body to block him off.\n\nLet's go!\n\nUP",

We're halfway through this marathon and the adrenaline is PUMPING! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 The opponent is absolutely dominating with 16 apples to our 8, and they're sitting pretty on the right side of the map. We need to make a move that secures our survival and sets us up to start chomping down those apples to catch up!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (1, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 4)\n*   **Enemy Body:** Tons of it, mostly on the right side and top of the board.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (1, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No collision with my body (lowest y is 4) and the enemy is far away.\n    *   **Strategy:** This pushes us further into the top-left corner. I can see apples at (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 9), etc., nearby. This keeps me away from the enemy's territory.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE & STRATEGIC. Good for hunting the cluster of apples on the left.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Board:** `T` (My Body - the neck)\n    *   **Safety:** Immediate collision. Moving back into the cell I just came from. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **Verdict:** ILLEGAL.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. Wall is there, but I'm not hitting it.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the left wall. From here, my only options are UP or DOWN (RIGHT goes back to (1, 7)). It's a bit restrictive, but safe.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE, but less flexible than UP.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** `A` (Apple)\n    *   **Safety:** Is it safe? Let's check. My body is at (1, 6), (1, 5), etc. The enemy body trails down the right side, but (2, 7) is clear on the board. *Wait!* Let's look closer at the board state.\n        *   Row 7: `. 1 A A . A . A T T`\n        *   My body is at (1, 7) now, moving to (2, 7).\n        *   Is (2, 7) occupied by the enemy? The enemy is at (9, 4). His body is listed as ending at (5, 6), but visually (2, 7) looks like an apple (`A`).\n        *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Is the apple at (2, 7) actually there? The Apple Drops list says `(2, 7)` is an apple. Yes.\n        *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Is there an enemy body part at (2, 7)?\n            *   Enemy body: `[(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)]`.\n            *   (2, 7) is NOT in this list. It is visually an `A`.\n    *   **VERDICT:** It is an apple. Eating it grows my length by 1. This is massive. I need apples to catch up to 16.\n    *   **Risk:** The enemy is at (9, 4). He moves simultaneously. If he moves UP to (9, 5), LEFT to (8, 4), or any other direction, he isn't hitting (2, 7).\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE, HIGH REWARD (Growth!), and moves me toward the apple cluster.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe opponent has a massive lead. Playing passive isn't an option if I want to win. I need to eat apples to grow and close that gap.\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 7)** allows me to eat an apple immediately. It keeps me in the top-left quadrant, away from the enemy on the right. From (2, 7), I'll be positioned to potentially grab (2, 8) or (3, 7) next. It opens up the board more than going LEFT to the wall.\n\nI'll take the apple. Let's chomp! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top-left apple cluster ((2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 9)). Grow my length to create a defensive wall if the enemy decides to invade my territory. Watch the enemy's movement towards the bottom-right.\n\n**END RATIONALE**",

We need to close this gap FAST, and we're hunting apples in the top-left quadrant to get those chomps in.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 3)\n*   **Enemy Body:** Long boi wrapping around the right edge, but he's way over there at x=9.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (2, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** `A` (Apple!)\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No body collision (my lowest y is 4). Enemy is far away at (9, 3).\n    *   **Strategy:** HUGE reward. Eating an apple grows me to length 10, closing the gap to 16 apples. From (2, 8), I can potentially go to (2, 9) or (3, 8) next. This is the aggressive play we need to catch up.\n    *   **Verdict:** HIGH REWARD & SAFE. Let's feast! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me down into the open space. I can see an apple at (0, 2) eventually, but it's far. From (2, 6), I have more options to move around, but I'm missing the immediate apple growth at (2, 8).\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE, but lower immediate reward. I need apples NOW to catch up.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** `T` (My Body - the neck)\n    *   **Safety:** Immediate collision. Moving back into the cell I just came from. **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n    *   **Verdict:** ILLEGAL.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Board:** `.` (Empty)\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. No collision. Enemy is at (9, 3), nowhere near here.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me into the center of the top-left area. From (3, 7), I can see an apple at (3, 7) listed in the drops? Wait, checking the drops: (3, 7) is an apple. Yes! (3, 7) is an apple.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE & REWARDING. Eating (3, 7) grows me too. But (2, 8) is UP, and I'm currently at (2, 7). UP feels like a direct path to the apple cluster.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm at (2, 7). The apple is at (2, 8). I need to eat it. Moving DOWN or RIGHT misses the immediate apple. Moving LEFT kills me. The only move that gives me instant growth and keeps me in the hunting grounds is UP.\n\nI'm taking the apple at (2, 8). I need to close that 7-apple gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2, 8). Grow to length 10. From (2, 8), scout for the next apple\u2014maybe (4, 9) or loop around to (0, 2). Keep the pressure on Snake #0. If he gets too close, use my body to block him out of my territory.\n\nUP",

There is an apple there.\n    *   **Safety:** Check my body... my highest Y is 8 (current head). The body goes down to Y=4. No collision.\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is at x=9. Safe distance.\n    *   **Verdict:** I EAT AN APPLE. This is huge. I grow to length 11 and get +1 point.

My immediate goal is growth to pressure the opponent.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm sitting on an apple at (2, 9). The only move that gives me immediate growth and keeps me safe is UP. Moving DOWN kills me. Moving LEFT or RIGHT wastes the opportunity to close the score gap. I need to eat to stay in this game.\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2, 9). Grow to length 11. From (2, 9), I'll have options to move to (1, 9), (3, 9), or potentially (2, 8) again (though that will be tail soon). I need to keep my eyes on the enemy. If he tries to cross over to my side, I need to be ready to block or cut him off. But first, I need the points.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! Turn 38 and the tension is REAL. I'm at 11 apples, opponent at 16. We're in a tight spot, but I just ate at (2, 9) and now I'm at (2, 9) with a length of 11. Let's break down the board from here.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (2, 9)\n*   **My Body:** Now includes (2, 9) as the new head, with the old head at (2, 8), and the tail is at (3, 5). I need to calculate my body positions correctly: My head is at (2, 9). The next segment is (2, 8), then (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5). The tail is at (3, 5). Wait, looking at the provided list: `Head: (2, 9), Body: [(2, 8), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]`. The list is Head-to-Tail. So the tail is (3, 5).\n*   **Opponent Head:** (9, 1). They are on the bottom right.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (2, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 10):**\n    *   **Board:** (2, 10) is off the grid.\n    *   **Safety:** CRASHED OUT.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** (2, 8) is currently occupied by my body (the segment right below my head).\n    *   **Safety:** CRASH INTO MYSELF.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 9):**\n    *   **Board:** (1, 9) is marked `.` (empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls. Safe from my body (my body is at y=8 and below). Safe from enemy body (enemy is at x=9).\n    *   **Strategy:** This opens up options to the left (0, 9) or down (1, 8). (1, 8) looks empty based on the grid `8 . . T . . . T T T T`. (0, 9) is currently `T` (Enemy tail), so I need to be careful moving into there if it gets eaten or moves.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Board:** (3, 9) is marked `T` (Enemy tail). Specifically, looking at Snake #0's body: `..., (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)...`. Wait, looking at the grid provided:\n       9 . . 1 A A . T T T T\n       8 . . T . . . T T T T\n    *   The grid shows `1` at (2, 9) (Me). To the right is (3, 9) which is `A`? No, wait. Let's look at the grid coordinates.\n       Row 9: ` . . 1 A A . T T T T `\n       Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n       (3, 9) is `A`.\n    *   Wait, the grid says (3, 9) is `A`.\n    *   Let's double check the opponent body list: `..., (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), ...`. So (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9) are `T`. (3, 9) is an `A`.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls. Safe from my body.\n    *   **Strategy:** (3, 9) has an apple! Eating it gets me to 12 apples. However, (3, 9) is adjacent to (4, 9) which is also an apple (`A` in the grid, and in the apple list). (4, 9) is marked `T` in the grid provided? No, let's look at the provided board state again.\n       9 . . 1 A A . T T T T\n       ...\n       0 . . A . . . . . A .\n    *   (3, 9) is `A`.\n    *   (4, 9) is `A`.\n    *   Is (3, 9) safe from the enemy head? Enemy is at (9, 1). He is far.\n    *   Is (3, 9) safe from enemy movement? The enemy is likely moving towards apples or me. He has 16 apples. I have 11. He wants to win.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (3, 9), I eat an apple. I grow.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1, 9), I do not eat an apple. I stay 11.\n    *   I need to close the gap. Eating is priority. Eating (3, 9) puts me at 12 apples.\n    *   Is there a trap? (4, 9) is an apple. (5, 9) is `T` (Enemy tail). If I eat (3, 9), next turn I can go to (4, 9).\n    *   However, the enemy might be moving to intercept. The enemy is at (9, 1). He is slow.\n    *   Let's check immediate safety. (3, 9) is `A`. No wall. No my body.\n    *   What about the enemy's move? The enemy is at (9, 1). He can move UP to (9, 2) (currently his body?), LEFT to (8, 1), DOWN to (9, 0), or RIGHT (wall).\n       *   Enemy body at (9, 2) (current). So UP is bad for him.\n       *   (9, 0) is `A`.\n       *   (8, 1) is `.`.\n    *   The enemy is growing (16 apples). He is likely hunting.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (3, 9), I am in the top row.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1, 9), I am in the top row.\n    *   (3, 9) has an apple. (1, 9) does not.\n    *   Eating apples is the only way to catch up.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need points. (3, 9) has an apple. (1, 9) does not.\n(3, 9) is safe.\nI am at (2, 9). Moving RIGHT to (3, 9) consumes the apple.\nMoving LEFT to (1, 9) does not.\nI choose RIGHT.\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3, 9) to reach 12 apples. From (3, 9), I will have the option to move to (4, 9) next turn (which is also an apple) or (3, 8) (empty). I need to maintain pressure on the opponent by staying on the top row and securing points. Watch the enemy's trajectory; if he comes up the right side, I might need to cut him off later.\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent is still chilling at 17, so we need to keep the pressure on. We are currently at (4, 9) with a massive tail behind us. Let's look at the immediate threat.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (4, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):**\n    *   **Board:** Off the grid.\n    *   **Safety:** CRASHED OUT.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Board:** (4, 8) is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls. My body is at (3, 9), (2, 9), etc. Enemy is at the bottom right. This is safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This keeps us in the upper middle of the board.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Board:** (3, 9) is currently empty (it was my head, now it's the space I just left).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls. Safe from my body (tail is far back). Enemy is far.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving back to where I was.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):**\n    *   **Board:** (5, 9) is marked `A` (Apple). Look at the board state: `9 ... 1 A A . T...`. (5, 9) is definitely an apple.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from walls. Safe from my body. The enemy is at (8, 0). Even if they move UP, they are miles away.\n    *   **Strategy:** **DOUBLE EAT OPPORTUNITY.** I just ate at (4, 9). If I move to (5, 9), I eat *another* apple. This brings me to 14 apples. I am on a roll and closing the gap (17 vs 14 is much better than 17 vs 13).\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE AND EXTREMELY SCORING. AGGRESSIVE.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am chasing the score. The gap is 4 apples. I need to eat every chance I get. Moving RIGHT secures another point immediately and keeps me at the top of the board where the apples are clustered. I have to take the points while they are hot. The enemy is far enough away that a head-on collision is unlikely this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apple at (5, 9) to hit 14. From there, look to sweep across the top or drop down into the center. The enemy is building a huge body on the right side; I need to dominate the left and center to force them into a corner. Don't get boxed in, but don't give up free points.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 41 and the pressure is CRANKED! \ud83d\udea8\n\nWe just ate that apple at (5, 9) last turn, bringing us to **14 apples**, but the opponent is STILL out there chilling at **18 apples**. That gap is 4 apples and we need to close it FAST. We are currently at (6, 9) (I moved RIGHT from (5, 9) because the turn just processed).\n\nLet's look at the board.\nThe opponent is still at the bottom right: Head (7, 0), Body winding up the right side.\nMy body is stretched across the top row and looping down left. Currently my head is at (6, 9).\nThe apple at (5, 9) is gone (that's where I just came from).\nLook at the board state for (6, 9): `9 ... 1 A A . T ...` -> Wait, looking at the provided board state:\n`9 A . T T T 1 T T T T`\nLet's re-read the board state carefully.\nRow 9: `A . T T T 1 T T T T`\nCoordinates:\n(0,9)=A\n(1,9)=.\n(2,9)=T (My body)\n(3,9)=T (My body)\n(4,9)=T (My body? Wait, I moved to (5,9) last turn, so (4,9) became tail? No, I grew. Let's trace my body.)\n**My Body Trace:**\nHead: (5,9) (Last turn's result)\nBody: [(4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8)...]\nThe board state provided is the *current* state *before* my move this turn? No, the prompt says \"Turn: 41 / 150\". The board state is the visual representation of the current grid.\nWait, the board state shows `1` at coordinate (5,9)? No, looking at the ASCII:\n`9 A . T T T 1 T T T T`\nThis row corresponds to Y=9.\nLet's map it out:\nX=0: A\nX=1: .\nX=2: T (My body)\nX=3: T (My body)\nX=4: T (My body)\nX=5: 1 (My Head? Wait, I moved to (5,9) last turn. If I moved to (5,9), that cell should be my head.)\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:**\nThe board state provided is *exactly* as described in the input.\nInput says: \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (5, 9)\".\nInput Board:\nRow 9 (Y=9): `A . T T T 1 T T T T`\nThis means:\n(0,9): Apple\n(1,9): Empty\n(2,9): Tail/Body\n(3,9): Body\n(4,9): Body\n(5,9): Head (1)\n(6,9): Empty? Wait, the visual shows `T` at index 6? No, the visual is:\n`9 A . T T T 1 T T T T`\nIndices 0 to 9.\n0: A\n1: .\n2: T\n3: T\n4: T\n5: 1\n6: T\n7: T\n8: T\n9: T\nSo (6,9) is a `T`. That is my body.\n(7,9), (8,9), (9,9) are also `T`s (based on the list: (9,9), (8,9), (7,9) are in my body list).\nWait, my body list is: `[(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`\nIf my head is (5,9), then (4,9) connects to it.\n(3,9) connects to (4,9).\n(2,9) connects to (3,9).\nThen it goes down to (2,8).\nSo where did the `T`s at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9) come from?\n**MISMATCH ALERT!**\nThe Board State ASCII art does NOT match the provided text list of coordinates for my snake.\nThe text list says my body is mostly on the left side (x=0-4).\nThe ASCII art shows my body occupying x=2,3,4,6,7,8,9 on the top row.\n**Which one to trust?**\nUsually, the specific coordinate list is the source of truth for logic, but the ASCII board is the visual representation.\nHowever, looking at the opponent's list:\nOpponent Head: (7,0)\nOpponent Body: [(8,0), (9,0)... (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)...]\nThe ASCII board at Row 9 shows `T`s at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9).\nThe opponent's body list explicitly includes (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9).\n**CONCLUSION:** The `T`s at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9) on Row 9 belong to the ENEMY (Snake 0), not me!\nMy visual on the board is:\n`9 A . T T T 1`\nMeaning:\n(0,9): Apple\n(1,9): Empty\n(2,9): My Body\n(3,9): My Body\n(4,9): My Body\n(5,9): My Head (1)\n(6,9): Enemy Body (T)\n(7,9): Enemy Body (T)\n(8,9): Enemy Body (T)\n(9,9): Enemy Body (T)\n\nOkay, crisis averted. Logic is solid.\nCurrent Head: (5, 9)\nAvailable moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** OFF BOARD. DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 9):**\n    *   Board: `T` (My own body).\n    *   Logic: (4,9) is the segment connecting my head to the rest of my body.\n    *   Safety: CRASH into myself. DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n    *   Board: `T` (Opponent's body).\n    *   Logic: (6,9) is part of Snake #0's long tail stretching across the top.\n    *   Safety: CRASH into enemy. DEATH. \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 8):**\n    *   Board: Row 8 is `8 . . T . A . T T T T`.\n    *   Coordinate (5, 8): Looking at X=5, Y=8. The visual shows `.` (empty).\n    *   Safety: No wall, no body (mine is mostly left/top, enemy is right/top).\n    *   Verdict: **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nWe are pinned in a corner!\nWe are at (5,9).\nLeft is our own body (4,9).\nRight is enemy body (6,9).\nUp is wall.\nDown is the ONLY opening.\nWe *must* go DOWN.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are forced to drop down from the top row. The enemy is stretched out across the top row to the right. By going DOWN to (5, 8), we escape the pin.\nWe need to look for apples. There is an apple at (5, 7) (from the list: (5,7)).\nIf we go DOWN to (5,8), we are safe this turn.\nNext turn, we can potentially go DOWN again to (5,7) to eat an apple.\nHowever, the opponent is huge. We need to be careful not to run into their body as we descend.\nThe opponent's head is at (7,0). They are at the bottom right. We are dropping near the middle-right (x=5).\nWe need to clear the top \"cage\" and get into the open space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDrop down to (5, 8) immediately to survive. Then aim for the apple at (5, 7). Once we eat, we need to navigate the center of the board. The opponent is long and slow; we can outmaneuver them if we stay agile. Watch out for the enemy's body as we descend from the top.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP:** Death (Wall).\n*   **LEFT:** Death (Self).\n*   **RIGHT:** Death (Enemy).\n*   **DOWN:** Safe (Empty).\n\nWe have no choice. We are forced down.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

The ASCII board is a visual snapshot that might be slightly outdated or misaligned with the coordinate list. **I must trust the coordinate list provided in the text.**\n            *   **Official State:** My Head is (5, 8).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   Coordinates: (5, 7).\n    *   Board State: Row 7 (Y=7).\n    *   Visual: `7 .

We need to eat.\n*   **UP:** Safe (empty), but leads me back to the top row where I was just trapped. It doesn't gain me an apple.\n*   **LEFT:** Safe (empty), moves me away from the enemy. No apple.\n*   **DOWN:** Safe (empty), **AND there is an apple at (5, 7)!**\n\nThis is a no-brainer. We take the apple. We grow. We get points. We get closer to the enemy's score.\n\n**Check for Head-on Collisions:**\n*   My move: DOWN to (5, 7).\n*   Enemy Head: (6, 0). Enemy is moving. Where will he go?\n*   Enemy Body occupies the right side (x=9) and top right.\n*   If the enemy moves UP to (6, 1), he is far away.\n*   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, -1), he dies (off board).\n*   If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 0), he is far away.\n*   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 0), he stays on board.\n*   Can the enemy reach (5, 7)? No. He is at y=0. I am at y=8.\n*   Can the enemy's body move into (5, 7)? No, his body is static on the right side.\n*   Can my own body hit me? My body is at (4,9), (3,9)... (2,4). Moving to (5,7) is clear.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Move DOWN to (5, 7)** to eat the apple.\n2.  **Next turn:** Look at (5, 6) or (4, 7). We need to start navigating the center.\n3.  **Watch the enemy:** They are huge. If I can get them to chase me or trap them, I win.\n\nWe are taking the food. Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

He is far away.\n    *   Enemy Body is mostly on the right edge (x=9) and top row.\n    *   My own body is winding from (5, 8) -> (4, 9) -> ... -> (2, 4).\n    *   Moving to (5, 6) is empty and doesn't hit my tail immediately (since I just grew, my tail stays at (2, 4) this turn, effectively lengthening me).\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n3.  **CHECK MOVE: LEFT to (4, 7)**\n    *   Board shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it safe?\n    *   Enemy is far away.\n    *   My body is at (5, 8) (previous head) and (4, 9) etc.\n    *   (4, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n4.  **CHECK MOVE: UP to (5, 8)**\n    *   Board shows `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it safe?\n    *   This is my *previous* head position. Since I moved DOWN to (5, 7), (5, 8) is now empty (my body segment there moves to (5, 7) effectively).\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n**ANALYSIS OF SAFE MOVES:**\n\n*   **UP (5, 8):** Takes me back to where I was. Not aggressive.\n*   **DOWN (5, 6):** Moves me further down into the open space below. No immediate apple, but keeps me moving away from the enemy's wall on the right.\n*   **LEFT (4, 7):** Moves me closer to the left wall and away from the enemy.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nThe enemy is at (5, 0). He is on the bottom row, x=5. I am at (5, 7).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 6), I am on the same vertical column as him (x=5). He is at y=0. I am at y=6. We are far apart.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 7), I move off his column. This might be safer long-term to avoid a direct line of confrontation if he rushes up.\n\nHowever, looking at the apples:\nThere is an apple at **(5, 4)**.\nThere is an apple at **(2, 0)**.\nThere is an apple at **(3, 7)**.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 7), I am closer to the apple at (3, 7) (to my left). I am also closer to the apple at (2, 0) eventually (by going down the left side).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 6), I am closer to the apple at (5, 4).\n\nThe opponent is on the right side. To box him in, I usually want to occupy the center or the opposite side. But he is huge and covering the right side completely.\nThe board is getting tight. I need to navigate around the \"T\" (enemy body) at (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9).\n\nLet's look at the immediate threats.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 7), I open up the move to (3, 7) next turn (which has an apple!).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 6), I open up moves to (5, 5) or (4, 6).\n\nLet's check the apples again.\nApple at (3, 7).\nMy current pos: (5, 7).\nIf I go **LEFT**, I land at (4, 7). Next turn I can go LEFT again to (3, 7) and eat the apple.\n\nIs (4, 7) safe from the opponent?\nOpponent is at (5, 0). Even if he moves UP every single turn, it will take him 6 turns to reach me. By then, I will have eaten apples and grown.\n\n**The Trap:**\nThe opponent is against the right wall (x=9). He is basically a line.\nIf I can secure the left side and center, I can potentially cut him off.\nHowever, he has 19 apples. I have 14. He is massive. He can afford to play slow.\nI need points.\n\nThe apple at (3, 7) is \"free\" (no enemy body there).\nThe apple at (5, 4) is also \"free\".\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **LEFT**.\nWhy?\n1.  It moves me away from the opponent's column (x=5).\n2.  It sets me up to eat the apple at (3, 7) next turn (Left -> Left).\n3.  It avoids moving directly toward the \"T\" wall on the right (which is at x=6).\n\nWait, let me double check the board visual.\nRow 7: `7 . T T A . 1 A A . T`\nMy head is at index 5 (5,7).\nIndex 4 (4,7) is `.`.\nIndex 6 (6,7) is `T`.\nSo LEFT is open.\n\nThe opponent is at (5,0).\nIf he moves UP (5,1), he eats an apple (Apple at (5,1)). He grows.\nIf he moves LEFT (4,0), he hits a wall? No, (4,0) is `.` (based on row 0: `A . A . . 0 ...`).\nIf he moves RIGHT (6,0), he hits his own body (6,0) is part of his body list? Let's check.\nOpponent Body: `[(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)...`\nWait, his head is (5, 0). His body starts at (6, 0).\nSo (5,0) -> (6,0) is his body.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,0), he crashes into his own body.\nSo he cannot move RIGHT.\nHe can move UP to (5,1) (Apple there).\nHe can move LEFT to (4,0) (Empty).\nHe can move DOWN to (5,-1) (Death).\n\nHe will likely move UP or LEFT.\nIf he moves UP, he gets an apple. He grows. He becomes even more of a threat.\n\nI need to secure my position.\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 7) is the play. It keeps me alive and sets up the apple at (3, 7).\n\nLet's consider the \"Box In\" strategy.\nThe opponent is trapped on the right. I am on the left/center.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving further into my territory.\n\nIs there any reason to go DOWN?\n(5, 6) is empty.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (5, 6).\nNext turn I could go LEFT to (4, 6).\n(4, 6) is empty (Row 6: `. T . . . . . . . . T`).\nIf I go DOWN, I am getting closer to the apple at (5, 4).\nBut the apple at (3, 7) is 1 move away if I go LEFT now.\n\nLet's compare:\nOption A: LEFT to (4, 7). Next turn: LEFT to (3, 7) [Apple].\nOption B: DOWN to (5, 6). Next turn: DOWN to (5, 5), then DOWN to (5, 4) [Apple].\n\nOption A gets the apple in 2 turns total (current turn + 1 next turn).\nOption B gets the apple in 2 turns total (current turn + 1 next turn).\n\nDistance is equal.\nSafety:\n(4, 7) is further from the opponent than (5, 6) is?\nOpponent is at x=5. (4, 7) is x=4. (5, 6) is x=5.\n(4, 7) is 1 unit horizontally offset. (5, 6) is directly below the opponent's column (but far away vertically).\nActually, (4, 7) is safer because it is not on the same vertical line as the opponent.\n\nHowever, if I go LEFT, I am moving towards the wall at x=0.\nLet's look at the left wall.\nRow 7 col 0 is `.`.\nRow 6 col 0 is `.`.\nRow 5 col 0 is `T` (Opponent body? No, wait).\nRow 5 (Y=5): `T T . . . . . . A T`\nRow 0 (Y=0): `A . A . . 0 T T T T`\n\nLet's look at the opponent body coordinates again.\n`Body: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]`\nThe opponent covers:\n- Bottom row (x=6 to 9).\n- Right column (y=1 to 9).\n- Top row (x=6 to 9).\n\nThe opponent does **NOT** cover the left side (x=0 to 4) at all.\nThe left side is mostly empty or my own body (which is also on the left side).\nMy body is on the left side: `(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)... (0, 5)... (1, 4)`.\nI own the left side.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am moving deeper into my own territory. This is safe.\nThe opponent cannot reach me there.\n\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am moving towards the center.\nThe center is \"No Man's Land\".\nThe opponent is at (5, 0). If he moves UP repeatedly, he will enter the center.\nIf I am at (5, 6) or (5, 5), we might collide.\nIf I am at (4, 7) or (3, 7), I am offset. I can navigate around him.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** prioritizes safety and positioning over the immediate \"center\" apples.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is a guaranteed score if I secure the path.\nMoving **LEFT** avoids the vertical line x=5 where the opponent is located.\n\nLet's check if (4, 7) is actually empty.\nBoard Row 8 (Y=8): `. . T . A . T T T T`\nBoard Row 7 (Y=7): `. T T A . 1 A A . T`\nMy head (5, 7) is '1'.\n(4, 7) is the character to the left of '1' in Row 7.\nRow 7 string: `. T T A . 1 A A . T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nIndex 4 is `.`. Correct.\n\nSo, **LEFT** is safe.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the \"Box In\" strategy.\nThe prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nHe is on the right. I am on the left.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from him.\nHow do I box him in if I move away?\nI box him in by occupying the space *around* him or cutting off his escape.\nHe is already against the wall. He can only go Left or Up (or die going Right/Down).\nIf I go DOWN, I might cut off his path Up?\nHe is at (5, 0). To go Up, he goes (5,1), (5,2)...\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am not blocking him. I am just sharing the column.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), I am freeing up the column for him to move up.\n**BUT**, he is huge. His body is long.\nIf he moves UP, his body will fill the column.\nIf I stay on the column (x=5), I risk running into his body as it grows upwards.\nIf I move OFF the column (x=4), I avoid his growing body.\n\nExample:\nI stay at (5, 6).\nOpponent moves UP to (5, 1). He eats apple. He grows. His tail doesn't move yet (he grew).\nNext turn, he moves UP to (5, 2).\nHis body is now at (5, 1)...\nEventually, if I am at (5, 6), and his body fills up to (5, 5), I die.\n\nSo, moving **LEFT** to (4, 7) is actually the correct defensive maneuver to avoid his expanding vertical reach.\n\n**Strategy Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 7).\nNext turn, look at moving LEFT again to (3, 7) to eat the apple.\nOr look at moving DOWN to (3, 6) or (4, 6) if the apple becomes contested.\n\n**Final Check:**\nOpponent Score: 19\nMy Score: 14\nGap: 5\nI need apples.\nApple at (3, 7) is visible and reachable.\nApple at (5, 4) is also reachable but requires moving through the column the opponent might occupy.\n\nDecision: **LEFT**.\n\nOne more check on the \"Head on Collision\" rule.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7).\nIf the opponent moves... where can he go?\n(5, 0) -> (6, 0) is blocked by his body.\n(5, 0) -> (5, 1) is Apple.\n(5, 0) -> (4, 0) is Empty.\n(5, 0) -> (5, -1) is Death.\nHe is likely to move UP or LEFT.\nIf he moves UP, he is at (5, 1). I am at (4, 7). Safe.\nIf he moves LEFT, he is at (4, 0). I am at (4, 7). Safe.\nNo head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nI am safe to move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

(3, 7) is an apple.\n        *   What is the `T` at (2, 7)? It's part of my body (index 7 in my list: `(2, 7)`).\n        *   So, (3, 7) is safe from my body.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nThe opponent is on the right. I need to dominate the left.\n**UP to (4, 8)** puts me closer to the top edge, but also closer to the apple at (4, 8).\n**LEFT to (3, 7)** keeps me in the mid-left area.\n\nLet's look at the future.\nIf I go **UP**:\n    *   Head (4, 8). Apple eaten.\n    *   Next moves: I can go LEFT to (3, 8), UP to (4, 9), or RIGHT to (5, 8).\n    *   (4, 9) is part of my body? Yes, body list has `(4, 9)`.\n    *   (5, 8) is part of my body? Yes, body list has `(5, 8)`.\n    *   (3, 8) is empty? Row 8: `. . T . A . T...` Wait, Row 8 is `(0,8)` to `(9,8)`.\n    *   Row 8 string: `. . T . A . T T T T`\n    *   Col 0: `.`\n    *   Col 1: `.`\n    *   Col 2: `T` (Enemy body? No, Enemy is on the right. Let's check Enemy body coords).\n        *   Enemy Body includes `(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)`.\n        *   (3, 8) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   So if I go UP, I am safe, but my \"forward\" options (UP/RIGHT) are blocked by my own body.\n\nLet's look at **LEFT**:\n    *   Head (3, 7). Apple eaten.\n    *   Next moves: LEFT to (2, 7), DOWN to (3, 6), UP to (3, 8).\n    *   (2, 7) is my body. \u274c\n    *   (3, 6) is empty? Row 6: `. T . . . . . . . . T`. Col 3 is `.`.\n    *   (3, 8) is empty? Row 8 Col 3 is `.`.\n    *   So if I go LEFT, I open up (3, 6) and (3, 8).\n\n**DECISION:**\nBoth UP and LEFT give me an apple.\n**UP (4, 8)** gives me +1 score.\n**LEFT (3, 7)** gives me +1 score.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state, (4, 8) is an apple. (3, 7) is an apple.\nThe opponent is at (5, 1). He is far.\nThe board is 10x10.\nI am at (4, 7).\nIf I go UP to (4, 8), I am on the top half.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 7), I am on the left half.\n\nLet's check the \"Box In\" strategy.\nThe opponent is on the right. To box him in, I need to control the center or left.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is \"safer\" regarding future moves because it opens up DOWN and UP moves. (4, 8) restricts movement because (4, 9) and (5, 8) are occupied by my own body.\n\nLet's verify (4, 9) and (5, 8).\nMy body: `[(5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9)...`\nIf I am at (4, 8):\n- UP to (4, 9) -> My own body. DEATH.\n- RIGHT to (5, 8) -> My own body. DEATH.\n- LEFT to (3, 8) -> Empty.\n- DOWN to (4, 7) -> Will be empty (my tail moves).\n\nIf I am at (3, 7):\n- UP to (3, 8) -> Empty.\n- DOWN to (3, 6) -> Empty.\n- LEFT to (2, 7) -> My own body (index 7: `(2, 7)`). DEATH.\n- RIGHT to (4, 7) -> Empty.\n\nBoth spots offer limited moves, but (3, 7) seems slightly better for maneuvering in the left corridor. (4, 8) is a bit of a trap near my own body pile-up at the top-left corner.\n\nAlso, the apple at (3, 7) is slightly more central/left, keeping me away from the enemy on the right.\n\nWait, looking at the prompt's board again:\nRow 7: `. T T A 1 T . A . T`\nThe apple at (3, 7) is immediately to my left.\nThe apple at (4, 8) is immediately above me.\n\nLet's look at the opponent. He is at (5, 1).\nIf he moves UP, he gets the apple at (5, 1). He grows.\nIf I take the apple at (3, 7), I am securing a point on the left side.\nIf I take the apple at (4, 8), I am securing a point on the top side.\n\nIs there any immediate threat from the opponent?\nDistance: Opponent head (5, 1) vs My head (4, 7). Distance = 6 moves (Manhattan).\nOpponent body is on the right side (x=6..9).\nI am safe for the next few turns regardless of which apple I pick.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI will pick **LEFT**.\nWhy?\n1.  It grabs the apple at (3, 7).\n2.  It keeps me slightly lower on the board than (4, 8), giving me more vertical room to maneuver if the opponent rushes up the center column (x=5).\n3.  It avoids the \"dead end\" feeling of being sandwiched between my own body parts at (4, 9) and (5, 8).\n\nPlan for next turn: After eating at (3, 7), I will likely move DOWN to (3, 6) or UP to (3, 8) to position for the next apple. The apple at (2, 0) is far away, but the apple at (1, 1) or (2, 1) might be reachable via the left side.\n\nLet's GO!\n\nLEFT",

I'd be moving toward a wall (top edge) with my own body blocking my retreat. I can't go RIGHT (into my own neck at 5,7? No, wait. If I move UP to (4,8), my neck moves to (4,7).

(4,6) is not in my body list.\n    *   Enemy is at (5,1) - far away.\n    *   Is this good? It moves me away from the top corner and into the center. But it doesn't grab an apple immediately. We need points to catch up!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):**\n    *   Board shows `A` at (3, 7). \n    *   Is it safe? My body list: `(2,7)` is part of my tail! \n    *   Wait, let's check the coordinates carefully.\n    *   My body: `[(5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (1, 7)...]`\n    *   (3, 7) is NOT in my body list.\n    *   (2, 7) is my body.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (3, 7), I eat the apple. \n    *   My tail will move forward. \n    *   This move is SAFE. It grabs a point.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n    *   Board shows `T` at (5, 7).\n    *   That is my neck/body part. \n    *   Moving into myself = DEATH. \u274c **ILLEGAL.**\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI have two safe moves that don't kill me immediately: **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n**LEFT** gives me an apple (+1 Score).\n**DOWN** gives me no apple.\n\nSince I am down by 6 points (15 vs 20), I MUST take the apple to stay competitive. \nGoing **LEFT** to (3, 7) eats the apple and opens up a new corridor. From (3, 7), I can go DOWN to (3, 6) or UP to (3, 8) next turn. (3, 8) is empty according to the board map (Row 8: `. . T . A . T T T T`, so Col 3 is `.`). (3, 6) is also empty (Row 6: `. T . . . . . . . . T`, Col 3 is `.`).\n\nThe enemy is on the right side (x=5+). By going LEFT, I am moving away from him and securing the left side. \n\nLet's look at the apple drops again: (0,2), (7,7), (4,2)... \nBy moving LEFT to (3,7), I am positioning myself centrally on the left side, opening up options towards (2,0) or (1,1) apples eventually.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGrab the apple. Maintain aggression. Don't get trapped in the corner with my own body.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (3,7). Pivot downward towards (3,6) next turn to avoid the body pile-up at the top. From there, I can sweep the lower left quadrant. I need to close the 5-point gap. The enemy is heavy on the right, so the left is MINE.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT",
