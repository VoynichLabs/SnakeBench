Distance to (8, 3) becomes 2 cells. Good progress.\n- **LEFT (6, 5)**: Moves toward (6, 3). Distance to (6, 3) becomes 2 cells vertically. Also good.\n- **UP (7, 6)**: Moves away from the apple cluster. Poor choice.\n\n**Optimal Decision:**\nDOWN is the best move because:\n- It moves me directly toward the (8, 2)/(8, 3) apple cluster\n- From (7, 4), I can easily reach (8, 3) on the next turn\n- This keeps me on an efficient path through the densest apple area\n- The enemy at (2, 9) is far away and moving away from me\n- This maintains good positioning for collecting multiple apples in sequence\n\n**Long-term plan for next 3 turns:**\n1. DOWN to (7, 4) - approach the vertical apple line\n2. RIGHT to (8, 4) - get closer to (8, 3) and (8, 2)\n3. DOWN to (8, 3) - collect apple at (8, 3)\n4. Continue DOWN to (8, 2) - collect next apple\n5. After that, pursue (6, 3) or monitor enemy position if they get closer\n\nDOWN",
