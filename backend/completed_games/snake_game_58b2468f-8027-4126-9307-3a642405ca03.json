Now I'm at position (3, 3) with my body at [(3, 2), (2, 2)]. I've grown by one segment and gained a point!\n\nNow I need to decide on my next move. Let me check what's around me:\n- UP: Would move me to (3, 4) - this looks safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN: Would move me to (3, 2) - this is where my body segment is, so I'd crash into myself!\n- LEFT: Would move me to (2, 3) - this looks safe\n- RIGHT: Would move me to (4, 3) - this looks safe\n\nDOWN is definitely out since that would be suicide.\n\nNow let me consider the remaining apples and their positions:\n- (7, 4) - to the right and slightly up\n- (1, 0) - to the left and down\n- (9, 0) - far right and down  \n- (0, 9) - far left and up\n- (0, 4) - left at same y-level\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (6, 5) with body at [(5, 5)]. They're getting closer to the apple at (7, 4), so I should consider whether to compete for that apple or go for a different one.\n\nLooking at my options:\n1. Go RIGHT towards (4, 3) - this would start me on a path toward the apple at (7, 4), but I'd be competing with the enemy snake\n2. Go LEFT towards (2, 3) - this would start me toward the apple at (1, 0) or (0, 4)\n3. Go UP towards (3, 4) - this keeps me moving upward, could go for (0, 9) eventually or position for other apples\n\nI think going LEFT toward (2, 3) is a good strategic choice because:\n- It moves me toward two apples: (1, 0) and (0, 4)\n- It keeps me away from the enemy snake who seems to be positioned closer to (7, 4)\n- The apple at (0, 4) is at the same y-level, so relatively close\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT, continue toward either the apple at (0, 4) or (1, 0), depending on positioning.

From (6, 4) I can safely move RIGHT for the apple.\n- Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (7, 5) also allows me to go DOWN to (7, 4).\n- Both paths are equally safe currently. However, moving DOWN may be slightly better because it starts to line me up for two apples in lower half (if new apples spawn or after I get (7, 4), (1, 0) and (9, 0) are further down), whereas moving RIGHT puts me on the upper row, not as close to other apples.\n\n**Potential trap detection:**\n- If I go DOWN to (6, 4), my body will be at (6, 5) and (5, 5), so after grabbing the apple I will be at (7, 4) and have a long tail trailing back safely. No collision risk.\n- Enemy is unlikely to threaten this area for at least 2-3 turns.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n- After moving DOWN to (6, 4), if safe, move RIGHT to (7, 4) (to eat apple).\n- After getting apple, egress options are safe\u2014can head back UP/RIGHT/LEFT as needed.\n- Monitor enemy movement and new apple spawns; if enemy aims toward (0, 4) or (3, 3), consider switching to a less contested apple.\n\n**Decided move:**  \n**DOWN**"
