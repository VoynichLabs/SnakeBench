DOWN or RIGHT keep more options open. Since enemy is far and apples are in bottom-left, DOWN seems good to open space away from my long body in top-right.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7, 4), I can go LEFT/DOWN to continue toward apples while avoiding traps.\n\nDOWN",

Need to check enemy movement this turn.  \n\nActually, enemy could be at (2, 1) or (4, 1) next turn. If enemy goes LEFT to (2, 1), my RIGHT next turn would be into enemy head \u2192 head-on collision if enemy stays there? Wait, enemy moves simultaneously next turn too, so risky.  \n\nFrom (1, 3) after UP:  \n- UP: (1, 4) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN: (1, 2) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n- LEFT: (0, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: (2, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nSafe next moves: 3 options.  \n\nFrom (0, 2) after LEFT:  \n- UP: (0, 3) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN: (0, 1) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT: (-1, 2) \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- RIGHT: (1, 2) \u2192 my body \u274c  \n\nSafe next moves: 2 options \u2014 worse mobility.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple but reduces next-turn mobility to 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT) if enemy is at (2, 1) blocking RIGHT. Also, if enemy goes LEFT to (2, 1), then next turn enemy could move UP to (2, 2) or DOWN to (2, 0) or LEFT to (1, 1) \u2014 if I\u2019m at (1, 1), enemy could go LEFT to (1, 1) \u2192 head-on collision? Actually, enemy\u2019s LEFT from (2, 1) is (1, 1), which would be my position next turn if I go DOWN now. But next turn I\u2019d move away from (1, 1) before enemy arrives? No \u2014 simultaneous movement: if I go DOWN now to (1, 1), enemy goes LEFT now to (2, 1). Next turn: I\u2019m at (1, 1), enemy at (2, 1). If enemy chooses LEFT next turn to (1, 1), and I choose any move, we collide heads at (1, 1) and both die. That\u2019s bad.  \n\nSo DOWN is risky if enemy goes LEFT this turn.  \n\nUP is safe from enemy and good mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is tempting for apple but carries head-on collision risk next turn if enemy goes LEFT now. Since I\u2019m ahead in apples (12 vs 10), I should avoid risky head-on collisions.  \n\nUP is safer and keeps options open.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove toward apples (1, 6) or (0, 7) after ensuring enemy is not nearby. Keep distance from enemy head to avoid accidental collisions.  \n\nUP",
