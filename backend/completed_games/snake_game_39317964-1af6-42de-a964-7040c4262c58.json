Eliminate **RIGHT**.\n\n2. **Self-collision:**\n   - Since your snake has no body, you cannot collide with yourself (no immediate risk here).\n\n3. **Enemy collision:**\n   - Enemy head is at (4, 1). Your possible moves are (9,7), (9,9), or (8,8).\n   - None of these overlap with (4,1), so no immediate collision risk from enemy.\n\n**Eliminated move: RIGHT**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves**\nRemaining safe moves: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**\n\n#### **Move UP (to (9, 7)):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward the apple at (9, 2) (directly down from here).\n  - No immediate threats.\n- **Cons:**\n  - If you move up, your head will be at (9,7) next turn. The enemy snake will also move this turn, but its head is at (4,1), so no direct collision.\n  - However, if the enemy moves toward you, it could block future progress.\n\n#### **Move DOWN (to (9, 9)):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward the apple at (9, 5) (directly down from here).\n  - No immediate threats.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Similar to UP, but the apple at (9, 5) is slightly farther away than (9, 2).\n\n#### **Move LEFT (to (8, 8)):**\n- **Pros:**\n  - Moves toward the apple at (8, 7) (directly left from here).\n  - No immediate threats.\n- **Cons:**\n  - The apple at (8, 7) is closer than (9, 2) or (9, 5), but you are already at the edge of the board (x=9), so moving left is a good short-term gain.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Prioritize Moves Based on Strategy**\n1. **Short-term gain (apple proximity):**\n   - (8, 7) is the closest apple (1 cell away).\n   - (9, 2) is 1 cell away but requires moving down twice.\n   - (9, 5) is 2 cells away.\n\n2. **Avoiding enemy threats:**\n   - Enemy is at (4,1) and will move this turn. It cannot immediately reach you, but if it moves toward you, it could block future progress.\n   - Moving LEFT to (8,8) is a safe, immediate win if the apple is there.\n\n3. **Long-term planning:**\n   - If you move LEFT, you will be at (8,8) next turn. The enemy could move toward you, but since you are a single segment, it\u2019s unlikely to collide unless it moves directly toward you.\n   - Moving UP or DOWN is safer in the long run because you can avoid being trapped.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Decision**\nGiven the immediate apple at (8, 7) is the closest, and moving LEFT is safe, I will choose **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Plan for Future Self:**\n- **Turn 1:** Move LEFT to (8, 8) and eat the apple at (8, 7).\n- **Turn 2:** If the enemy moves toward you, avoid moving directly into its path. If no threat, move toward the next closest apple (e.g., (9, 2)).\n- **Turn 3:** Continue expanding while avoiding enemy snakes. Prioritize apples that are closest and safe to reach.\n\n---\n**Final move: LEFT**",
