You are alone at the top-right corner.\n- There is one enemy snake (ID 1) at (3,1) with no body segments.\n- Apples are at: (5,9), (4,2), (4,4), (6,6), (5,4)\n\n**Possible moves from (9,6):**\n- UP: (9,7) - within bounds, no snake body there (currently empty), and no enemy head can reach it this turn? Enemy is at (3,1) so it can move anywhere but not to (9,7) in one move. So safe.\n- DOWN: (9,5) - within bounds, safe.\n- LEFT: (8,6) - within bounds, safe.\n- RIGHT: (10,6) - off the board (x max is 9), so invalid.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow, which moves are safe? UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe.\n\n**Which move is best?**\nWe want to move towards apples and avoid head-on collisions. The enemy is far away (at (3,1)), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nApples:\n- (5,9) is far, but we are at (9,6) - we need to go left and up.\n- (4,2) is far and down-left.\n- (4,4) is left and down.\n- (6,6) is close! Only 3 steps left (from x=9 to x=6) and same y=6.\n- (5,4) is left and down.\n\nThe closest apple is (6,6) - same row (y=6), just to the left. So moving LEFT (to (8,6)) gets us closer to (6,6). Also, (5,9) is up and left, so LEFT is good for that too.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (8,6), we can go LEFT again to (7,6) and then to (6,6) to eat the apple. That seems efficient.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP to (9,7): moves away from most apples (except (5,9) which is up-left, but we are at top already so going up might limit options).\n- DOWN to (9,5): moves down, which might be useful for (4,4) and (5,4), but (6,6) is same level so better to go left first.\n\nSo LEFT seems best.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead towards (6,6) to get first apple. Then consider going for (5,9) or (4,4) next. Avoid enemy snake which is currently far. Keep an eye on enemy movements.\n\nLEFT",

No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider apples:**  \nClosest apples: (4,2) is 2 moves away (Manhattan distance = |3-4| + |1-2| = 1+1=2).  \n(4,4) is 4 moves away.  \n(5,4) is 5 moves away.  \n(4,2) is the closest.  \n\nFrom (3,1):  \n- UP to (3,2) \u2192 distance to (4,2) becomes |3-4| + |2-2| = 1.  \n- RIGHT to (4,1) \u2192 distance to (4,2) becomes |4-4| + |1-2| = 1.  \n- LEFT to (2,1) \u2192 distance to (4,2) = 3.  \n- DOWN to (3,0) \u2192 distance to (4,2) = 3.  \n\nSo UP or RIGHT both reduce distance to the nearest apple equally.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety / space:**  \nFrom (3,2): possible next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all likely open except maybe near enemy later).  \nFrom (4,1): possible next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (also open).  \n\nBoth are safe now, but moving UP gets me closer to the top apples later if needed.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily:**  \nEnemy at (9,6), far away, so not an issue.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose:**  \nUP or RIGHT both fine. I'll pick UP because (3,2) is slightly more central and leaves more options to go toward multiple apples (4,2) above or (4,4) further up.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove toward (4,2) apple next turn if still there, but check enemy movement first.

No risk of dying.  \n\nEating early gives length advantage and more future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (4, 2), avoid moving back into own body at (3, 2).

Moving DOWN gets you closer.\n- (5,9) is above, but farther away.\n- (9,3) is far right and down.\n- (0,7) is far left and up.\n\nThe closest apples are (4,4) and (5,4) at y=4.

You need to be cautious about potential head-on collisions if you both go for the same apple.\n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (6,5) is safe and puts you one step closer to the apple cluster. From there, you could go LEFT to (5,5) or further DOWN to (6,4) next turn.\n\nLEFT to (5,6) is also safe but doesn't get you as close to the apples vertically.\n\nUP to (6,7) moves you away from the closest apples.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to approach the apple cluster at (4,4) and (5,4).\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (6,5), you'll have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe (unless enemy moves into them, but currently enemy is at (4,3) which is not adjacent to (6,5)).\n\nPlan for next few turns: Head towards the apple cluster at (4,4) and (5,4). Be aware of enemy snake #1 which is also near there. Avoid moving directly into the enemy's path.

          "rationale": "**Current situation:**  \nMy snake head at (5, 4), body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2)], length 4 (just ate apple).  \nApples: (5, 9), (9, 3), (0, 7), (7, 6), (8, 1).  \nEnemy snake #0: head at (6, 4), body at (6, 5), length 2, apples: 1.  \n\n**Possible moves from (5, 4):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 5) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 4) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 4) \u2013 enemy head? Wait, enemy head is at (6, 4) now. That would be a head-on collision if I go RIGHT and enemy stays or moves into (5, 4)? Let's check: enemy is at (6, 4) now. If I go RIGHT to (6, 4) and enemy stays there (moves elsewhere?), but we move simultaneously. If enemy moves away from (6, 4) this turn, then (6, 4) becomes empty and safe. If enemy stays at (6, 4) (by moving DOWN to (6, 3)? No, DOWN from (6, 4) is (6, 3), so staying means choosing a move that ends at (6, 4) \u2014 impossible unless they move LEFT to (5, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 4) etc. Actually, enemy\u2019s current head is (6, 4). To stay at (6, 4), they\u2019d have to move in a direction that returns to (6, 4) in one move \u2014 impossible. So (6, 4) will be empty after this turn unless enemy moves LEFT into (5, 4) \u2014 which would be a head-on collision with me if I go RIGHT? Let's map it:  \n\nEnemy at (6, 4) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 5) \u2013 its own body, unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2013 my current head position, but I will move away if I choose RIGHT/UP/DOWN. If I go RIGHT to (6, 4), enemy goes LEFT to (5, 4), then we swap positions without collision (I go to (6, 4), enemy goes to (5, 4)). That\u2019s safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo RIGHT to (6, 4) is safe regardless of enemy move:  \n- If enemy goes LEFT to (5, 4), we swap.  \n- If enemy goes DOWN/RIGHT, (6, 4) empty.  \n\nUP to (5, 5) is safe unless enemy goes UP? Enemy can\u2019t reach (5, 5) in one move from (6, 4).  \nDOWN to (5, 3) is safe.  \n\nLEFT is unsafe (my body).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 4) and enemy goes LEFT to (5, 4), next turn I\u2019m at (6, 4), enemy at (5, 4). Then possible head-on if we both move toward each other again (me LEFT to (5, 4), enemy RIGHT to (6, 4)) \u2014 but that\u2019s future.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (7, 6) at distance |7-5|+|6-4| = 2+2=4.  \n(8, 1) distance 3+3=6.  \n(5, 9) distance 0+5=5.  \n(0, 7) far.  \n(9, 3) distance 4+1=5.  \n\nGoing RIGHT moves toward (7, 6) and (9, 3).  \nUP moves toward (5, 9).  \nDOWN moves toward (8, 1).  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n- RIGHT to (6, 4): body becomes [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], tail (4, 2) gone. Next turn from (6, 4): UP (6, 5) enemy body? Enemy body at (6, 5) currently, but enemy will move, so (6, 5) may become empty if enemy moves away. DOWN (6, 3) empty. LEFT (5, 4) my body. RIGHT (7, 4) empty. So likely 2\u20133 safe moves.  \n- UP to (5, 5): body [(5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], tail gone. Next turn from (5, 5): UP (5, 6) empty, DOWN (5, 4) my body, LEFT (4, 5) empty, RIGHT (6, 5) possibly enemy body if enemy moves UP? But enemy at (6, 4) could go UP to (6, 5) but that\u2019s its own body now \u2014 unsafe for them, so unlikely. So (6, 5) likely empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (5, 3): body [(5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)], tail gone. Next turn from (5, 3): UP (5, 4) my body, DOWN (5, 2) empty, LEFT (4, 3) my body, RIGHT (6, 3) empty. So 2 safe moves.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy length 2, less dangerous unless they eat apple. They might go for (7, 6) or (8, 1). If I go RIGHT, I\u2019m closer to (7, 6) and could beat them there.  \n\n**Best move:**  \nUP gives most future safe moves and opens space. RIGHT moves toward nearest apple (7, 6) but slightly riskier if enemy also goes for it. Given my length advantage (4 vs 2), I can afford to be slightly aggressive.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (5, 5), next turn avoid DOWN into (5, 4). Likely go UP toward (5, 9) or LEFT/RIGHT to open area. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position \u2014 if they move toward (7, 6), I might loop around to collect other apples.  \n\nUP",

Wait, my body after my move depends on my move).  \n\nLet\u2019s simulate:  \n\n**If I go UP to (6,6):**  \nMy new body: [(6,6),(6,5),(5,5),(5,4)] (tail (4,4) gone).  \nEnemy moves:  \n- UP to (7,6) \u2013 eats apple, grows to length 3, body becomes [(7,6),(7,5),(7,4)].  \n- LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 hits my old head position (now my body segment) \u2192 enemy dies.  \n- RIGHT to (8,5) \u2013 safe.  \n\nSo if enemy chooses LEFT, they die and I win. If they choose UP, they get apple and are at (7,6).  \n\n**If I go DOWN to (6,4):**  \nMy new body: [(6,4),(6,5),(5,5),(5,4)] (tail (4,4) gone).  \nEnemy moves:  \n- UP to (7,6) \u2013 apple.  \n- LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 hits my body segment (6,5) \u2192 enemy dies.  \n- RIGHT to (8,5) \u2013 safe.  \n\nAgain, enemy LEFT kills them.  \n\n**If I go RIGHT to (7,5):**  \nMy new body: [(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(5,4)] (tail (4,4) gone).  \nEnemy moves:  \n- UP to (7,6) \u2013 apple, survives, body becomes [(7,6),(7,5),(7,4)] but my head is at (7,5) same time? Wait simultaneous move: we both move at same time. If enemy goes UP to (7,6) and I go RIGHT to (7,5), no collision.  \n- LEFT to (6,5) \u2013 my old head position, now empty (since I moved to (7,5)), so enemy survives, body becomes [(6,5),(7,5),(7,4)] but my head is at (7,5) same time? No, at turn end my head is at (7,5), enemy head at (6,5) \u2014 no collision.  \n- RIGHT to (8,5) \u2013 safe.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe unless enemy stays at (7,5) (impossible, they can\u2019t go DOWN into own body). So RIGHT is safe.  \n\n**But** if enemy goes LEFT to (6,5) and I go RIGHT to (7,5), we swap positions without collision.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (7,6) at distance 2 from me (1 up, 1 right). From (6,5), UP then RIGHT gets it. From (6,5), RIGHT then UP gets it.  \nEnemy at (7,5) is 1 step from (7,6) (UP). So enemy could eat it this turn if they go UP.  \n\n**Strategy:**  \nIf I go UP to (6,6), I\u2019m farther from (7,6) but enemy might die if they go LEFT. If enemy is smart, they\u2019ll avoid LEFT since they can see my head at (6,5) currently. They\u2019ll probably go UP for apple or RIGHT to avoid risk.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,5), I block enemy from moving LEFT (since I\u2019d be there), but they can still go UP for apple. Then next turn I\u2019m at (7,5) and can go UP to (7,6) if apple still there (if enemy didn\u2019t take it). But if enemy takes it, they grow and occupy (7,6), so I can\u2019t go there.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (6,4) moves away from nearest apple but might tempt enemy to go LEFT into death.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nUP to (6,6): next turn from (6,6): UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5) my body, LEFT (5,6) empty, RIGHT (7,6) possibly enemy or apple \u2192 2 or 3 safe moves.  \nRIGHT to (7,5): next turn from (7,5): UP (7,6) maybe enemy/empty, DOWN (7,4) enemy body, LEFT (6,5) my body, RIGHT (8,5) empty \u2192 only 1 safe move (RIGHT) if enemy at (7,6) and (7,4) occupied. Risky.  \nDOWN to (6,4): next turn from (6,4): UP (6,5) my body, DOWN (6,3) empty, LEFT (5,4) my body, RIGHT (7,4) enemy body \u2192 only 1 safe move (DOWN). Risky.  \n\nSo UP gives more options next turn.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nGo UP to (6,6). This avoids possible collision, keeps options open, and if enemy goes LEFT into my old head, they die and I win. If enemy goes UP for apple, I\u2019m still close to other apples (5,9) and safe.  \n\n**Next turn plan:**  \nFrom (6,6), assess if (7,6) is occupied. If apple still there and safe, go RIGHT then UP to get it. Otherwise, consider moving toward (5,9) via UP/LEFT. Keep away from enemy if they grow.  \n\nUP",

Wait, simultaneous move: if I leave (6,6) and enemy moves into it, no collision unless I also move into it). Actually, if I go UP to (6,7) and enemy goes LEFT to (6,6), they occupy my old head position, which is now empty, so they survive.  \n\n**Safety check:**  \n- RIGHT: risky because if enemy chooses LEFT (into my current square), we swap and no collision. But if enemy stays (impossible) or chooses RIGHT/UP, I survive. However, enemy might choose LEFT to avoid collision? They see my head at (6,6) and might avoid moving into it. But if they do move LEFT, we swap safely. So RIGHT is *probably* safe, but still a risk if they stay (they can't).  \n- UP: safe, moves to empty (6,7).  \n- LEFT: safe, moves to empty (5,6).  \n- DOWN: unsafe (my body).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (5,8) distance |6-5|+|6-8|=1+2=3.  \nFrom (6,6):  \n- UP to (6,7): then distance to (5,8) = 1+1=2.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): then distance to (5,8) = 0+2=2.  \nBoth equal.  \n\nOther apples: (5,9) is farther, (0,7) far, (9,3) far, (8,1) far.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (6,7): possible moves next turn: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6) my body, LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7) \u2192 3 safe moves likely.  \nFrom (5,6): possible moves next turn: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5) my body, LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) my old head position (empty) \u2192 3 safe moves likely.  \n\nBoth are similarly safe.  \n\n**Enemy consideration:**  \nEnemy at (7,6) is close. If I go LEFT to (5,6), I put more distance between us. If I go UP to (6,7), I stay closer horizontally.  \nEnemy might go for apple (5,8) or (5,9) as well.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nI prefer LEFT to (5,6) because:  \n1. It moves me toward apple column (x=5) for (5,8) and (5,9).  \n2. It increases distance from enemy head (currently at (7,6)), reducing collision risk next turn.  \n3. Still keeps multiple options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,6), consider moving UP toward (5,8) if safe, but check enemy movement.

From (6,8), next turn you can consider LEFT to (5,8) to potentially get the apple, or continue UP to (6,9).\n\nPlan for next turn: After moving UP to (6,8), your head will be at (6,8) with body segments at (6,7) and (7,7). The apple at (5,8) will be adjacent. Watch enemy snake #1's position - if they're at (5,8), avoid head-on collision. Consider moving LEFT to (5,8) only if safe, or UP to (6,9) to approach (5,9).\n\nUP",

I go UP to (5,8), enemy goes UP to (6,8) \u2192 not same.  \n- Both into (6,7)? I go RIGHT to (6,7), enemy goes LEFT to (5,7) \u2192 not same.  \n- Both into (5,7)? I stay (by moving DOWN? unsafe anyway), enemy goes LEFT to (5,7) \u2192 collision if I\u2019m still at (5,7) after move. But I won\u2019t stay because DOWN is unsafe.  \n\nSo actually RIGHT is risky only if enemy goes RIGHT (impossible, enemy\u2019s RIGHT is body) or if enemy goes UP while I go RIGHT? That\u2019s fine.  \n\nBut careful: enemy\u2019s LEFT is (5,7). If I go RIGHT to (6,7), enemy goes LEFT to (5,7) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (5,8), enemy goes LEFT to (5,7) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,7), enemy goes LEFT to (5,7) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo all three possible moves avoid head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Eating apple:**  \nUP goes directly onto apple (5,8) \u2192 grow to length 5, score 4 apples.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n- UP to (5,8) apple: new head at (5,8), body becomes [(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5)] length 5. Next turn moves from (5,8): UP (5,9) apple, DOWN (5,7) my body, LEFT (4,8) empty, RIGHT (6,8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- LEFT to (4,7): next turn moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7) my body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (6,7): next turn moves: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6) my body, LEFT (5,7) my body, RIGHT (7,7) enemy body \u2192 only UP safe? Wait, check: from (6,7) after move, my body will be at (5,7),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5). So (6,6) is my body, (5,7) is my body, (7,7) is enemy body. So only UP to (6,8) is safe. That\u2019s a dead-end next turn. So RIGHT is bad for future options.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s threat:**  \nEnemy at (6,7) after its move:  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,8), then next turn it could go LEFT to (5,8) or UP to (6,9).  \nIf I go UP to (5,8) and eat apple, enemy could go to (6,8) and next turn try to collide with me at (5,8) if I stay? But I\u2019ll move away.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT leads to only one safe move next turn \u2192 risky.  \nLEFT is safe but moves away from apples.  \nUP eats apple, increases score lead, and keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (5,8), apple at (5,9) is above. Consider moving UP to (5,9) if safe (check enemy head possible moves). If enemy might head-collide into (5,9), maybe go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid risk. Keep expanding toward top-left apples (0,7) later.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP  \n\nUP",

LEFT is unsafe (into my head) unless I move away.  \n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 we swap heads, no collision (different cells).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,8) and enemy stays in (6,8) (i.e., enemy goes DOWN? unsafe) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t stay because DOWN is body.  \nIf I stay at (5,8) (i.e., move UP or LEFT) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 head-on collision (enemy enters my current cell while I\u2019m still there).  \nBut if I move UP to (5,9), enemy goes LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I move LEFT to (4,8), enemy goes LEFT to (5,8) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo moving UP or LEFT avoids head-on collision.

However, if enemy chooses RIGHT to (7,8), (6,8) becomes empty. If enemy chooses UP to (6,9), (6,8) becomes empty. So (6,8) will likely be empty after move. But there\u2019s a small risk: if enemy chooses LEFT into my head (5,8) while I go RIGHT into (6,8), we swap, safe.

But we can assess next turn.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): length stays 5, body: [(4,8),(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5)]? Wait, tail stays: actually moving without apple means tail moves off (6,5), so body becomes [(4,8),(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(6,6)].

If enemy goes UP, then (6,9) occupied next turn, making my RIGHT from (5,9) dangerous.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives immediate apple, but next turn only LEFT is certainly safe (UP off board, DOWN body, RIGHT possibly enemy head). That\u2019s a potential trap.  \nLEFT gives no apple but keeps 3 safe moves next turn and stays away from enemy.  \nRIGHT gives no apple and leaves only 1 safe move next turn.  \n\nBetter to take apple now and deal with next turn\u2019s limited options then, because apple lead is valuable and enemy is shorter.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (5,9), if enemy is at (6,9), my only safe move is LEFT to (4,9).

So enemy will go RIGHT to (7,9).  \n\nThus after this turn:  \n- Enemy head at (7,9).  \n- My head at either (4,9) if LEFT, or (6,9) if RIGHT.  \n\n**Safety check:**  \n- LEFT (4,9): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,9): will be empty after enemy moves RIGHT, safe.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n- LEFT to (4,9): body becomes [(4,9),(5,9),(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(6,6)] (tail (6,5) moves off). Next turn from (4,9): UP off board, DOWN (4,8) empty, LEFT (3,9) empty, RIGHT (5,9) my body \u2192 two safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n- RIGHT to (6,9): body becomes [(6,9),(5,9),(5,8),(5,7),(5,6),(6,6)] (tail (6,5) moves off). Next turn from (6,9): UP off board, DOWN (6,8) enemy body, LEFT (5,9) my body, RIGHT (7,9) enemy head \u2192 zero safe moves \u2192 death.  \n\nSo RIGHT leads to certain death next turn. Only LEFT is viable long-term.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples: (4,3) is 6 steps away, (0,7) is 4 steps away horizontally, (8,1) and (9,3)/(9,4) are far. LEFT to (4,9) moves toward (0,7) area and also toward (4,3) vertically later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,9), safe moves are DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9). I\u2019ll aim to gradually descend toward the (0,7) apple while keeping space from enemy. Enemy at (7,9) is far for now.  \n\n**Final choice:** LEFT  \n\nLEFT",

The apple at (8,1) is still available and could be your next target. Continue focusing on collecting the remaining apples in the bottom-right quadrant while maintaining distance from the enemy snake. Be mindful of your growing body as it may limit your movement options in tight spaces.\n\nDOWN",

If enemy goes UP to (3,2), it might go toward (5,9) eventually.  \nIt won't threaten me immediately.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,5), I am moving closer to enemy and also into the area near enemy\u2019s upper body (8,5),(8,4)... but also near apple (5,9) and (7,7).\n\nHowever, my body blocks direct path from (1,5) to (5,3)-(5,5) region, so actually moving RIGHT might be safe but limits my options: from (1,5), next turn I could go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not LEFT (back to (0,5), which will be occupied by my body next turn after I move).  \nLet\u2019s check: After my move, my body shifts:  \nHead to new pos, tail from (5,5) to (5,4) etc. (0,3) will still be my body but (0,5) is now neck.\n\nActually, let\u2019s map it:  \nCurrent body: [(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5)]  \nIf I go UP: new head (0,6), body becomes: [(0,6),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4)] \u2014 tail (5,5) gone.  \nIf I go RIGHT: new head (1,5), body becomes: [(1,5),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4)] \u2014 tail (5,5) gone.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves next turn:  \nUP to (1,6) \u2014 empty.  \nRIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN to (1,4) \u2014 empty.  \nLEFT to (0,5) \u2014 my old head position, now a body segment ((0,5) becomes second segment) \u2192 so LEFT from (1,5) next turn would hit myself. So that\u2019s bad \u2014 reduces options.\n\nFrom (0,6) after UP:  \nUP to (0,7) \u2014 apple.  \nRIGHT to (1,6) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN to (0,5) \u2014 my body segment (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT off board.\n\nSo from (0,6), only UP and RIGHT are safe, but UP gets apple.\n\nGoing UP now sets me to get (0,7) next turn, giving me apple lead.  \nGoing RIGHT delays that and traps me a bit with fewer options next turn.\n\nGiven enemy is far away at y=1, focusing on apples (0,7) and (0,9) is good.\n\n**Long-term plan**: After eating (0,7), go to (0,8) then (0,9) for another apple. That gives me 11 apples vs enemy's 9. Then head right toward (5,9) or (7,7) while avoiding enemy\u2019s possible path upward.\n\n**Move choice**: UP to continue the left-wall strategy, collect apple next turn, gain lead.\n\nUP",

Wait, check: current tail is (8,3), after moving without apple, tail (8,3) disappears, new tail becomes (8,2)? Let's trace: current body: head (2,2), then (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(7,2),(8,2),(8,3). Moving UP: new head (2,3), shift all segments forward, last segment (8,3) removed, new tail (8,2).

If I go UP now to (2, 3), next turn I can go RIGHT to (3, 3) (safe if enemy not there), then UP to (3, 4) to eat apple.  \nGoing LEFT now moves away from that apple and toward enemy\u2019s area.  \n\nUP gives best future options (3 safe moves next turn) and moves toward nearest apple while avoiding trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 3), consider RIGHT to (3, 3) if safe, then UP to (3, 4) to eat apple.

Wait, note: after eating, the snake grows. So the body should now include the old head and the entire body, but the tail doesn't move until next turn. Actually, the body list provided is for the current state: head at (0,7), body segments: (0,6), (0,5), ... (5,4). So the tail is at (5,4).\n\n**Apples:** (9,5), (0,9), (5,9), (7,7), (3,4) \u2014 note (0,7) was eaten last turn, so it's gone.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:** head at (2,2), body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3)]\n\n**Safe moves from (0,7):**\n- UP: (0,8) \u2014 empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (0,6) \u2014 my body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (-1,7) \u2014 off board (unsafe)\n- RIGHT: (1,7) \u2014 empty (safe)\n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP leads to (0,8), which is empty. Then next turn, I can go UP to (0,9) which is an apple. This would give me 11 apples vs enemy's 9.\n- RIGHT leads to (1,7), which is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately. From there, I could go UP to (1,8) (empty), RIGHT to (2,7) (empty), or DOWN to (1,6) (empty). However, this moves me away from the apple at (0,9).\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (2,2). Its safe moves:\n- UP: (2,3) \u2014 empty? Actually, board shows (2,3) is my body? Wait, look at the board state: at row 3, column 2 is \"T\" (my tail). So (2,3) is occupied by my body? Actually, coordinates: (2,3) is x=2,y=3. In the board, at row 3 (which is y=3), column 2 (x=2) is \"T\" (my tail). So (2,3) is unsafe for enemy.\n- DOWN: (2,1) \u2014 its own body (unsafe)\n- LEFT: (1,2) \u2014 empty\n- RIGHT: (3,2) \u2014 empty? But (3,2) is empty? Actually, board at row 2 (y=2), column 3 (x=3) is \".\" (empty). So enemy can go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nEnemy is unlikely to threaten me immediately since it is at y=2 and I am at y=7.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue the left wall strategy: go UP to (0,8) this turn, then next turn go UP to (0,9) to eat that apple. That will give me 11 apples. After that, I can consider moving right toward (5,9) or (3,4) (which is closer), but be cautious of the enemy.\n\n**Move choice:**\nUP is safe and sets me up to eat (0,9) next turn. RIGHT is safe but doesn't provide immediate benefit and moves me away from the apple.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\nUP",
