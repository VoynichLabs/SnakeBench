          "rationale": "Yoooo Chat, what is UP?! We are back LIVE, locked and loaded for some serious Snake action! Look at this board, folks! It's a fresh start, a 1v1 grudge match, and we are going to absolutely annihilate Snake #0! Can we get some W-H-I-P-E-O-U-T in the chat if you're ready for the strategy?\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\nOur Head: (8, 7). We are currently in the top-right quadrant, relatively open.\nOpponent Head (Snake #0): (5, 2). They are way down near the center-bottom.\nApples near us: (8, 4), (7, 2), (6, 9), (9, 9)? Wait, let's look closer. Apples are at (6, 9) UP/LEFT of us, (3, 7) LEFT of us, (8, 4) DOWN of us. Oh, and (5, 5) a bit far.\nApples near opponent: (5, 3), (4, 1), (4, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3). The opponent is surrounded by apples! We gotta move fast and grab some apples on our side before they get too long!\n\n**The Plan (Turn 0):**\nThe primary goal right now is **expansion** and **positioning**. Since we are far from the opponent, we don't have to worry about an immediate head-on collision, but we need to start gobbling up territory.\n\n1.  **Evaluate Safety:**\n    *   Our head is at (8, 7).\n    *   UP (8, 8): Safe, open space.\n    *   DOWN (8, 6): Safe, open space.\n    *   LEFT (7, 7): Safe, open space.\n    *   RIGHT (9, 7): Safe, open space.\n    All four moves are immediately safe. EZ.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Opportunity (Apples):**\n    *   The closest and juiciest apple is (8, 4), which is 3 moves straight DOWN.\n    *   There's also (3, 7) which is 5 moves LEFT.\n    *   And (6, 9) which is 2 LEFT, 2 UP.\n\n3.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    Moving DOWN seems like the most direct route to a nearby apple ((8, 4) in 3 turns). However, if we go straight down, we might get cramped up on the right side if we start getting long. Also, the (8, 4) apple is a little close to the right wall.\n\n    Let's look at moving LEFT. If we go LEFT to (7, 7), we're heading towards the center of the board, which keeps more options open for future moves. From (7, 7), we can go up towards (6, 9), down towards (8, 4) (but we'd have to go back right), or continue left towards (3, 7).\n\n    Going UP towards (8, 8) puts us closer to the top rim, which limits our vertical options prematurely.\n\n    I think the best move here is to start moving towards the center-top section of the board. Moving **LEFT** gives us flexibility. It keeps the immediate *down* option open for the apple at (8, 4) if we change our mind, and sets us up nicely to contest the top half of the board, potentially moving towards (6, 9) next turn or circling down and right towards (8, 4). Plus, by moving left, we are widening the gap from the right wall, preventing early self-boxing.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note (Future Self):**\nInitial expansion phase focusing on the top-left quadrant (apples (6, 9) and (3, 7)). Once we have some length, we need to monitor Snake #0's movement. They are perfectly positioned to grab the cluster of apples down bottom. We need to prevent them from getting too long too fast, but primarily, focus on our own growth first. Let's aim LEFT this turn, then decide between pursuing (6, 9) or dropping back for (8, 4) based on efficiency and opponent presence.\n\nLEFT",

HIS HEAD: (8,7). Apples are scattered everywhere, but we gotta stay alive first.\n\nLet's check my four options:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT?** To (6,2). That's an empty space... BUT WAIT! Is Snake #1 gonna move towards that area? He's way up north-east. I think it's safe for now. Puts me closer to apples at (6,9) and (7,2) long-term.\n\n\u2b05\ufe0f **LEFT?** To (4,2). Also empty. Puts me closer to a cluster of apples at (3,4), (4,1), (4,0). That's a juicy area! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f **UP?** To (5,3). OH SNAP! That's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e Free growth on turn one? But wait... is it a trap? Gotta think about what Snake #1 will do. He might be going for his own apples. But eating this apple instantly grows my body, which could limit my future moves slightly. But CONTENT!\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f **DOWN?** To (5,1). Empty space. Moves me towards the apple at (4,1). Not bad.\n\nAll moves are safe. No immediate death. Now, which maximizes future options AND content?\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE STRATEGY:** That apple at (5,3) is RIGHT ABOVE ME. Immediate growth, but then my body is at (5,2). That might box me in a bit on the next turn? Let's think...\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #1 at (8,7). He's probably gonna go for the apple at (7,2) by moving down-left, or maybe (8,4) down. He's not a immediate threat to me this turn.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **LONG-TERM PLAN (For my future self):** Secure the central apple cluster near (3,4), (4,1). Try to predict Snake #1's path and cut him off from easy apples. Stay agile, don't get trapped in corners. Our body is our fortress, but also our prison if we're not careful!\n\nOkay, chat... the play is clear. We go for the CONTENT. We take the apple. We grow early. LET'S FEAST! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

Snake #0 grabbed an apple already! (5, 3) must have been their target, they are now length 2: (5, 3) Head, (5, 2) Body. They are right next to two more apples at (4, 1) and (4, 0). We need to get some length fast or the opponent will box us in with their long tail!\n\n**Current State Analysis and Objectives (Turn 1):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 7). We are currently length 1.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (5, 3). Body: [(5, 2)]. Length 2.\n*   **Closest Apples:** (3, 7) 4 moves away (LEFT). (8, 4) 3 moves away (DOWN/RIGHT). (6, 9) 3 moves away (LEFT/UP).\n\nOur primary goal remains **expansion** in the top half of the board while avoiding the center-bottom where Snake #0 is currently dominating the apple flow.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (7, 7):**\n*   **UP (7, 8):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **DOWN (7, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **LEFT (6, 7):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 7):** Safe. Open space (where we just came from).\n\nAll moves are immediately safe! We love to see the flexibility!\n\n**2. Evaluate Opportunity & Strategy:**\n\nWe need to decide if we commit to the top-left section (towards (6, 9) and (3, 7)) or loop down towards (8, 4) quickly.\n\n*   **Option A: Go LEFT towards (3, 7).**\n    *   Move: LEFT (6, 7).\n    *   Next potential move: LEFT (5, 7) or DOWN (6, 6).\n    *   This keeps us high and away from the opponent, guaranteeing immediate safety, and sets us up to grab the (3, 7) apple. (3, 7) is 4 moves away.\n\n*   **Option B: Go UP towards (6, 9).**\n    *   Move: UP (7, 8).\n    *   Next move: Left (6, 8) then UP (6, 9) to reach the apple in 3 total moves.\n    *   This utilizes the upper boundary while we're short, setting up a solid sweep of the top edge.\n\n*   **Option C: Go DOWN towards (8, 4).**\n    *   Move: DOWN (7, 6).\n    *   Next move: RIGHT + DOWN to get towards the apple (8, 4). This move is a bit awkward as it forces us back toward the corner we just left. Apple is 3 moves: (8, 4) in 3 turns (R, D, D).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nThe apple at (6, 9) is the closest safe target, reachable in 3 moves if we go UP, then LEFT, then UP. This keeps us firmly away from Snake #0's territory.\n\nLet's check the opponent's threat: Snake #0 is at (5, 3), possibly targeting (4, 1) or (4, 0). If they move LEFT (4, 3), they block access to the center. If they move DOWN (5, 2), they hit their tail, which is a common mistake for short snakes, but they could also be trying to curve around the bottom. Given their previous move was likely UP to grab (5, 3), they're probably feeling confident and will try to strike towards the next apple cluster. We don't need to head towards them yet.\n\nGoing **UP** to (7, 8) is the most proactive move to secure the (6, 9) apple and continue our expansion along the top half of the board. It maintains high flexibility (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN options next turn) and puts us on the quickest path to a meal! We need that +1 length, chat!\n\nLong-term strategy note (Future Self): Secure the (6, 9) apple (Target: L, U), then re-evaluate the board. If Snake #0 is still low, aim for (3, 7) next. We need to get 3-4 apples before we even think about fighting. Stay high and wide!\n\nUP",

Not the best play.\n- **LEFT (4,3)**: THIS IS THE WAY! \ud83d\ude80 Moves us DIRECTLY towards the western apple cluster. Next turn, we could go LEFT to (3,3) or UP to (4,4) to target apple (3,4). This sets up a dominant position.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **FUTURE PROOFING:** Moving LEFT keeps our options WIDE OPEN. From (4,3), we can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn (DOWN would be into our growing body, so we avoid that). We want to control the west side and box the enemy out later!\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Secure the western apples! From (4,3), target (3,4) then (4,1). Watch for enemy #1 trying to swoop down from the north. Plan to cut him off from the center apples!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 already has an apple, and we are hungry! We need to feast!\n\nLet's look at the board state!\n\n**Current State Analysis and Objectives (Turn 2):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 8). Length 1. We are positioning for the (6, 9) apple.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (4, 3). Body: [(5, 3)]. Length 2. Looks like they moved LEFT to grab the (4, 3) apple, which wasn't on the list, meaning they must have passed through (5, 3) where the last known head was, grew, and then moved to (4, 3). Oh wait, SNAKE #0's head was (5, 3) last turn, and the body was (5, 2)! The body listed for them now is [(5, 3)] and the head is (4, 3). This implies they moved LEFT from (5, 3) to (4, 3). And since they collected an apple, their TALE is now at (5, 3) and their HEAD is (4, 3). Wait, no, the snake list is HEAD-TO-TAIL.\n    *   Last turn, Head: (5, 3), Body: [(5, 2)].\n    *   If they moved LEFT to (4, 3) and collected an apple, the body would be [(5, 3), (5, 2)].\n    *   The board state says: Head: (4, 3), Body: [(5, 3)]. This means they *must* have eaten an apple at (4, 3) and the *new* tail is at (5, 3), right behind their previous head position. This is strange because (4, 3) wasn't on the apple list given previously. Let's assume the current board state provided is 100% accurate: Head (4, 3), Body (5, 3). Length 2.\n\nThe opponent is now threatening the cluster of apples around (4, 1) and (4, 0). They are deeply entrenched in the bottom B-section. We need to stay high!\n\n**Our immediate target:** The apple at (6, 9). It's 2 moves away if we move LEFT, then UP.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (7, 8):**\n\n*   **Boundary Check:**\n    *   UP (7, 9): Safe.\n    *   DOWN (7, 7): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (6, 8): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (8, 8): Safe.\n\n*   **Body/Opponent Check:** We are far from Snake #0. All moves are safe from immediate death. Phew!\n\n**2. Evaluate Opportunity & Strategy: Box 'em high!**\n\nOur goal is to reach (6, 9).\n\n*   **Option A: Go LEFT (6, 8).**\n    *   Gets us 1 step closer to (6, 9). Next turn, we can go UP to grab (6, 9). This is the fastest route to an apple.\n    *   *Follow-up estimate:* UP (6, 9).\n\n*   **Option B: Go UP (7, 9).**\n    *   We hit the edge, but it's safe. We can then move LEFT (6, 9) next turn to grab the apple in 2 moves, just like Option A.\n    *   *Follow-up estimate:* LEFT (6, 9).\n\n*   **Option C: Go DOWN (7, 7).**\n    *   This is moving away from the closest apple (6, 9). Bad play, chat. Don't do it! We have the advantage on the boundary now.\n\n*   **Option D: Go RIGHT (8, 8).**\n    *   Moves us away from (6, 9) and toward the (8, 4) apple, 4 moves away. Slower acquisition.\n\n**Decision:** Both UP and LEFT get us the (6, 9) apple in 2 turns. However, moving **LEFT** to (6, 8) keeps us slightly more centered for potential future moves towards (3, 7) or (1, 9) afterward, maintaining higher flexibility in the short term. If we go UP (7, 9), we are forced to move LEFT or RIGHT along the top edge.\n\nLet's stick to the high-flex path! Move to (6, 8). This targets the apple at (6, 9) and opens up our movement options away from the wall for future harvests.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0 (Head at (4, 3), Body at (5, 3)):**\nSnake #0 will most likely try to grab the cluster below them, potentially moving DOWN (4, 2) or LEFT (3, 3). If they move DOWN, they block (4, 2) and target (4, 1) or (4, 0). If they move LEFT towards (3, 3), they might try to get (3, 4). We don't need to contest this area yet. We need a length advantage before we engage!\n\nWe go LEFT! Secure the top half! Let's get that W, chat!\n\nLEFT",

He's not a threat to us right now.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 **PATH ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (4,4)**: Puts us ONE STEP from the apple at (3,4)! Next turn we can go LEFT to grab it. This is AGGRESSIVE and gets us GROWING! \ud83d\ude80\n- **DOWN (4,2)**: Moves us AWAY from the apple cluster. The closest apple is (4,1), but that's a less direct path. Not optimal.\n- **LEFT (3,3)**: Also puts us one step from apple (3,4)! Next turn we go UP. This is just as good as UP for getting that apple!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **FUTURE PROOFING:** Both UP and LEFT set us up perfectly for the (3,4) apple. Which one gives us MORE options after?\nFrom (4,4) we can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\nFrom (3,3) we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT next turn.\nBoth are great! But UP might be slightly better because it keeps us closer to the center, giving us more escape routes if the enemy ever comes down.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **STRATEGY NOTE:** SECURE THE (3,4) APPLE NEXT! Then target (4,1) and (4,0) to dominate the west side. Watch for enemy #1 trying to cut us off from the north later. We're building a POWER BASE!\n\nUP",

They are now eyeing the apples at (3, 4) and potentially (4, 6) or (5, 5). They are growing fast, we need to counter!\n\n**Immediate Objective:** Grab the (6, 9) apple and increase our length.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (6, 8):**\n\n*   **UP (6, 9) [APPLE!]:** Safe. This is the goal.\n*   **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe, but moving away from the goal.\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** Safe, keeps options open, but misses the apple.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe, but moves away from the edge/apple.\n\n**2. Evaluate Opponent Collision Risk:**\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 4). We are at (6, 8). They are too far away for a head-on collision this turn, and too far to block us. We have a clear shot at the apple! Secure the bag, chat!\n\n**3. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\nIf we move **UP** to (6, 9), we grab the apple, grow to length 2, and are positioned along the top wall. This is a critical first score!\n\n**Predicted Opponent Move (Snake #0 at (4, 4)):**\nThey need to decide between (3, 4) and (5, 5).\n*   If they go LEFT to (3, 4) (Apple!), they grow to length 3.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (5, 4), they are heading towards (5, 5) (Apple!).\n*   If they go UP to (4, 5), they are heading towards (4, 6) (Apple!).\n\nIt is highly likely Snake #0 will go for (3, 4) or (5, 5). Both are 1-2 moves away. If they go LEFT to (3, 4), they get the apple and are trapped slightly by the (0, 3) and (0, 2) apples if they decide to go down. That sounds like a good move for them.\n\nOur move is simple: **UP!** We get the apple, we grow, and we start dominating the top half of the board. Next turn, we evaluate if we can go for (1, 9) or pivot down to (3, 7).\n\nWe are going UP! Let's get this length advantage! Let's GOOOOOO!\n\nUP",

Snake #0, our nemesis, is getting too big for their boots. Two apples already? We gotta box them in! We gotta make them crash out!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 4):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (6, 9). Body: [(6, 8)]. Length 2. We are situated perfectly along the top wall.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (3, 4). Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3)]. Length 3. Woah! Snake #0 moved LEFT to (3, 4) and grabbed the apple there! They are now bigger than us! This is unacceptable, chat! This is a rivalry!\n\n**Board Overview:**\n*   **Immediate Apples:** (1, 9) is close by. (3, 7) is also potentially reachable.\n*   **Snake #0 Position:** (3, 4). They are deep in the left/lower quadrant.\n\n**Our Objective:** Maintain momentum, get length, and start pressuring Snake #0's pathing. We need to secure the (1, 9) apple.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (6, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (6, 10):** DANGER! Out of bounds! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (6, 8):** DANGER! Moving directly into our own body (tail is at (6, 8)!). Eliminate! We just grew, so our body is one step behind our head!\n*   **LEFT (5, 9):** Safe. Moving along the wall. Good path towards (1, 9).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 9):** Safe. Moving along the wall. Keeps options open, but away from the nearest apple.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Opponent Collision Risk & Apple Strategy:**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 4). They are nowhere near us. Head-on collision risk is zero for now.\n\nWe need to path towards the next logical apple. (1, 9) is 5 moves LEFT. (3, 7) is further away and requires us to move DOWN soon.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (5, 9)**:\n*   We maintain the high ground.\n*   We are now 4 moves away from (1, 9).\n*   Our body segment (6, 8) acts as a temporary roadblock if Snake #0 somehow warps up here (they won't, but safety first!).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (7, 9)**:\n*   We are moving towards (8, 9) (Apple: 1 spot away!), but this apple is not on the board yet (it\u2019s an 'A' in the list, but not visible on the board at T4). Wait, I must re-read the board state!\n\nLooking at the board state provided:\n 9 . A . . . . 1 . A .  <- (1, 9) is an Apple ('A'), (6, 9) is our head ('1'), (8, 9) is an Apple ('A').\n 8 . . A A . . T . . .\n\nAh, Snake #0's move to (3, 4) likely consumed the apple at (3, 4). The state shows the remaining apples.\n\nLet's re-examine the target apples:\n*   (1, 9) 5 moves away via LEFT.\n*   (8, 9) 2 moves away via RIGHT.\n\nWait a second, (8, 9) is a fantastic target! Why would we ignore a target just 2 moves away when (1, 9) is 5? We need to capitalize on proximity!\n\n**The Plan:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (7, 9). (1 move closer to (8, 9)).\n2.  Move RIGHT to (8, 9) (Apple!).\n3.  We gain another apple, increasing our length to 3, and positioning ourselves for a dominant sweep of the top right!\n\n**3. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7, 9) sets us up for a guaranteed apple next turn (unless Snake #0 gets there first, which is impossible given their current location at (3, 4)).\n\nThis is a superior maximizing play. We get longer, faster, and that gives us more area control and boxing potential later!\n\nWe are going RIGHT, chat! Let's secure the next piece of content!\n\nRIGHT",

We are catching up to Snake #0!\n\nLook at the board state!\n 9 . A . . . . T 1 A .\n 8 . . A A . . . . . .\n...\n\nWait... I see an 'A' at (8, 9)! I see our head '1' at (7, 9)! That is *it*! We calculated this perfectly! Let\u2019s get this apple and make some content!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 9). Body: [(6, 9)]. Length 2. We are one move away from the apple at (8, 9).\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (3, 3). Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 3. They are still hanging out in the bottom left, but they are getting *thicker*. We need to start putting pressure on them soon.\n\n**The Long-Term Plan:** Get to length 3 quickly. Then, use our dominant top-wall position to sweep up some more apples, potentially swinging down the right side of the board and cutting off Snake #0's escape routes into the center. We need to be ruthless!\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (7, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 10):** DANGER! Out of bounds! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (7, 8):** Safe. Keeps us along the right side, but away from the immediate apple.\n*   **LEFT (6, 9):** DANGER! Moving directly into our body (new tail position is (6, 9) because the head moved from there last turn)! Eliminate!\n*   **RIGHT (8, 9):** Safe. *AND* it's an Apple! This is the priority move!\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent (Snake #0 at (3, 3)):**\n\nSnake #0 has a few closer apples: (0, 3), (0, 2), (3, 2).\nThey are 5 moves away from us (if they go straight UP/RIGHT). They pose zero collision threat this turn.\n\nWhat are Snake #0's likely moves from (3, 3)?\n1.  **DOWN (3, 2):** Apple! (Strong probability).\n2.  **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe, but away from apples.\n3.  **UP (3, 4):** DANGER! Moving into their body! (They just came from (3, 4) last turn, so the tail is there.) Eliminate!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 3):** DANGER! Moving into their body (part of their segment is at (4, 4), they came from (4, 4) to (3, 4) to (3, 3), so body is (3, 4) and (4, 4)). Hmm, let's look closer. T4: Head (3, 4), Body [(4, 4), (4, 3)]. T5: Head (3, 3). So the body moved to [(3, 4), (4, 4)]. The current body is (3, 4) and (4, 4). Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) is safe, but moving to (4, 4) is hitting body. Wait, the turn list shows their *new* body after the move.\n    *   T4 Move: Head (3, 4), Body [(4, 4), (4, 3)].\n    *   T5 State: Head (3, 3), Body [(3, 4), (4, 4)].\n    The snake's tail segment is always the last in the body list, which is (4, 4).\n    *   Move RIGHT to (4, 3). Safe.\n    *   Move UP to (3, 4). DANGER! Hitting their own body!\n\nSnake #0 will likely go DOWN to (3, 2) for an apple, or maybe LEFT to (2, 3) to approach (0, 3) or (0, 2).\n\nRegardless of their move, we need to focus on our objective: getting this guaranteed apple at (8, 9).\n\n**3. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8, 9) secures us an apple, increases our length to 3, and puts us back on competitive footing with Snake #0.

Snake 0 thinks they're hot stuff with 3 apples, but we are coming for that lead! Turn 6 is where we establish total board dominance! Let's get this $W$!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 6):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 3. We are dominating the top-right corner.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (3, 2). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 4. Wait, Snake #0 got an apple last turn too! They are now length 4. (3, 2) looks like a recent apple grab. That means we are now trailing by length and by score (3 vs 4 apples/length). We need to ramp up the aggression!\n\n**Board Overview:**\nWe are at (8, 9). Apples nearby: (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 6), (8, 4).\nSnake #0 is at (3, 2). Apples nearby/recently grabbed: (0, 2), (0, 3), (4, 1), (7, 2), (7, 1).\n\n**Our Immediate Goal:** Get down the right side to prevent ourselves from getting boxed in against the top wall, and to snag some more highly-contested center/right apples, like (8, 4) or (7, 2).\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (8, 9):**\n\n*   **UP (8, 10):** DANGER! Out of bounds! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (8, 8):** Safe. Excellent move, keeps us along the right wall.\n*   **LEFT (7, 9):** DANGER! Moving into our body! (7, 9) is our first body segment. Eliminate!\n*   **RIGHT (9, 9):** Safe. Keeps us along the wall, but moves us away from immediate future apples.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent (Snake #0 at (3, 2)):**\n\nSnake #0 is likely going for those bottom-left apples.\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (3, 2):\n1.  **DOWN (3, 1):** Safe. Heading towards (4, 1), or perhaps circling back for (1, 2).\n2.  **LEFT (2, 2):** Safe. Clears way for (0, 2) and (0, 3).\n3.  **UP (3, 3):** DANGER! Hitting their body segment (3, 3). Eliminate!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe.\n\nSince Snake #0 is length 4, their tail is (4, 4). They are not close enough to threaten us with a collision this turn.\n\n**3. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 9), we secure the very corner, which is usually a safe spot, but it means we have to immediately go DOWN next turn, or we get stuck.\n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (8, 8), we stay aligned with the right side of the board and set ourselves up perfectly for a run down the wall toward important apples like (8, 4). This also gives us more options (LEFT or DOWN) next turn. It's the most flexible and aggressive move towards content.\n\nLet's go DOWN and start the sweep! We need to make up the score deficit!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nWe are aiming to sweep the right side (8, 8) -> (8, X) and then either take the center or swing wide to the bottom and cut off Snake #0. Watch out for (7, 9) becoming a bottleneck. We must move quickly away from our own shrinking tail space.\n\nDOWN",

But we can't get greedy and trap ourselves.\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 1):** This moves us DIRECTLY TOWARDS the apple cluster at the bottom. It's a safe move. Next turn from (3,1), our options would be UP (back to our neck at 3,2), LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1) which is an APPLE, or DOWN (3,0) which is EMPTY. This gives us 3 SAFE moves and a direct path to an apple! The BEST OPTION for maintaining momentum and increasing our score! \ud83d\ude80\n\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 2):** This is also a safe move. Next turn, we could go UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1) which is an APPLE, LEFT (back to 3,2), or RIGHT (5,2). It's good, but it keeps us further from the other apples in the cluster compared to going DOWN first.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 2):** Also safe! Next turn: UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1), LEFT (1,2) which is an APPLE, or RIGHT (back to 3,2). This gets us an apple next turn, but the (1,2) apple is a bit isolated. It's a solid choice, but not the most aggressive for our farming plan.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **LONG-TERM PLAN:** DOMINATE THE BOTTOM! Secure the (4,1) and (4,0) apples to build an insurmountable lead. Let the enemy snake wander the top of the map while we feast below. We need to be mindful of not boxing ourselves into the bottom-left corner later, but for now, let's FARM! \ud83d\ude9c\n\n**THE VERDICT:** Moving DOWN sets us up PERFECTLY to grab two apples in the next two turns with maximum safety and options.

That is NOT acceptable. We need to turn up the heat and box this rival in! We're coming for that W, baby! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 7):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 8). Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 3. We are hugging the right wall.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (3, 1). Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length 4. They're hanging out near the bottom-center.\n\n**Board Scan for Apples:**\nThe closest apples to us (8, 8) are (2, 8), (4, 6), (8, 4). (8, 4) is perfectly aligned for a straight shot down the wall. Snake #0 is near (4, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (1, 2). They have plenty of content down there.\n\n**Our Goal:** Maintain the right-side advantage, grab (8, 4), and then look to aggressively cross the board to cut off Snake #0 or contest the center.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (8, 8):**\n\n*   **UP (8, 9):** DANGER! Moving into our body segment (8, 9)! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** Safe. Keeps us on track for (8, 4).\n*   **LEFT (7, 8):** Safe. Our tail is currently (7, 9), so (7, 8) is safe for now, but it brings us closer to the center where Snake #0 might be heading. It sets us up perfectly to grab (2, 8) if we want to head left.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Safe. Dead end wall move. Less flexible than DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent (Snake #0 at (3, 1)):**\n\nSnake #0 is length 4. Their tail segment (3, 4) just moved to (X, Y) depending on their T6 move. Wait, the board state graphic shows Snake 0's body as $[(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]$. Let's assume their last move was DOWN from (3, 2) to (3, 1) and they did NOT eat an apple, meaning their tail at (4, 4) is gone. They are now length 4, their head is (3, 1) and tail is (3, 4). (The provided opponent body list is T-H-H-H, not H-T, so I must stick to the list order.) Head: (3, 1), Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)].\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (3, 1):\n1.  **DOWN (3, 0):** Safe. Targets (4, 0).\n2.  **LEFT (2, 1):** Safe. Targets (1, 2).\n3.  **UP (3, 2):** DANGER! Hitting their body segment (3, 2). Eliminate!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 1):** Safe and targets the apple at (4, 1). High probability move!\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 1), they eat the apple and grow to length 5. They will be moving up and right, looking to dominate the mid-lower section.\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (H2H):**\nWe are at (8, 8). Snake #0 is at (3, 1). No possibility of H2H collision this turn. Phew.\n\n**4. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Keeps us safe but wastes a turn on board advance.\n*   **LEFT (7, 8):** Moves us towards the center. Potentially good for a future move towards (2, 8) or cutting off Snake #0, but it moves us away from the immediate bounty at (8, 4).\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** This is the direct, aggressive move toward (8, 4). It maintains our advantageous position along the right wall. It also maximizes our freedom of movement in the future (we could go LEFT to (7, 7) or DOWN again to (8, 6) next turn).\n\n**Let's go DOWN!** We need to match Snake #0's apple count immediately. Next turn, we'll try for (8, 6) then (8, 5) then (8, 4) to grab that sweet content! We're starting the vertical sweep! Get ready for the clip, Chat! \ud83c\udfac\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nContinue moving DOWN the right wall to secure (8, 4). Once we hit (8, 4), we will be length 4 and looking for a way to pressure Snake #0, likely by moving LEFT across the bottom or middle of the board to cut off the bottom-left corner. Watch out for Snake #0 getting too long and making the board too restrictive.\n\nDOWN",

Let's get that content NOW!\n\n*   **LEFT to (2,1):** Also safe, but it moves us AWAY from the dense cluster of apples. The nearest apple is at (1,2) or (0,2), but that's a longer path.

We are stalking that right wall like a hunter! \ud83c\udff9\n\nBut look at the scoreboard: Snake #0 is now 4 apples to our 2! This is a DISASTER! We need to ramp up the aggression and get back in this game! We need to box this rival in and snatch those apples! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 8):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 7). Body: [(8, 8), (8, 9)]. Length 3. We are moving down the right wall, aiming for the (8, 4) apple.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (4, 1). Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length 5. Wait, they ate the apple at (4, 1)! NOOO! They are getting long! (The board shows 0 at (4, 1) and their body list is now 5 segments long, meaning they ate the apple that was at (4, 1). Their new body is likely $[(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]$ with the tail still at (3, 4) if they moved from (3, 1) to (4, 1) and ate. This means they grew one segment, pushing the coordinates back one. Let's assume the provided body list is still accurate H-T and the board state reflects the new reality: Head (4, 1), Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. Length 5. They are a threat!)\n\n**Board Scan for Apples:**\nClosest apples to us (8, 7): (4, 6), (8, 4), (2, 8). (8, 4) is our primary target, 3 steps away (if we can skip over the body segment that might be at (8, 5) or (8, 6) later).\n\nClosest apples to Snake #0 (4, 1): (4, 0), (7, 1), (1, 2), (7, 2). They have great options! They might go for (4, 0) or cross the board for (1, 2).\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (8, 7):**\n\n*   **UP (8, 8):** DANGER! Moving back into our body segment (8, 8)! Eliminate!\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** Safe. Continues the vertical sweep. Great move towards (8, 4).\n*   **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe. Opens the board. Sets us up for (4, 6) or even a cut across the board.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe. Dead end wall move. Less flexible.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent (Snake #0 at (4, 1)):**\n\nSnake #0 is now length 5. Head: (4, 1), Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)].\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (4, 1):\n1.  **UP (4, 2):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 0):** Highly likely move! Targets the apple at (4, 0). They would grow to 6 segments.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 1):** DANGER! Moving into their body segment (3, 1). Eliminate!\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 1):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 1).\n\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN, they eat (4, 0) and dominate the bottom edge. If they go UP or RIGHT, they open themselves up for a potential future cut-off maneuver by us. Given their length and proximity, DOWN is highly favored.\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (H2H):**\nWe are at (8, 7). Snake #0 is at (4, 1). No possibility of H2H collision this turn.\n\n**4. Decision Time: The Move!**\n\nWe must commit to our apple path, or we will fall too far behind. The apple at (8, 4) is uncontested and essential for evening up the score.\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe, but slows our apple progress.\n*   **LEFT (7, 7):** This is interesting. It puts us on a path potentially toward (4, 6) or (7, 2), but it\u2019s a detour from the easy (8, 4) path. If Snake #0 moves into the center, this move gets us closer to contesting them, but right now, apple safety is paramount.\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** This is the direct route! We are 2 moves away from the apple at (8, 4). This move keeps us safe and directly progresses our score.\n\nWe need to maintain pressure and prioritize growth. Sticking to the wall is the safest, most efficient path to our next apple.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nContinue moving DOWN the right wall to secure (8, 4). Once we secure (8, 4) and are length 4, we must then move aggressively LEFT, possibly at (8, 3) or (8, 2), to cut off Snake #0 as they continue to explore the bottom half of the board. Speed is key, Chat! We're not slowing down until we get that W!\n\nDOWN",

We are FREE TO FARM! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **APPLE CHECK & STRATEGY:** THE BUFFET IS STILL OPEN! We are in the PERFECT SPOT to extend our lead!\n\n*   **DOWN to (4,0):** This is the AGGRESSIVE, HIGH-REWARD PLAY! \ud83d\ude80 We IMMEDIATELY grab another apple, grow to a length of 6, and our head lands on (4,0). This secures our lead and puts us right at the bottom edge. From there, we can look to go RIGHT to (5,0) or LEFT to (3,0) next turn. LET'S GET THIS CONTENT!\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5,1):** This is a SAFE, CONSERVATIVE move. It moves us away from the immediate apple but keeps us in a very open area with tons of future options. We could then go DOWN to (5,0) next turn to get that apple, or UP to (5,2), etc. It's not a bad move, but it's not the MOST aggressive.\n\n*   **UP to (4,2):** This moves us AWAY from the apple cluster. We'd be heading into more open territory but leaving free apples on the table. It's the LEAST optimal move for our farming strategy.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TURN'S SELF): WE ARE THE KINGS OF THE BOTTOM ROW! After securing the (4,0) apple, our next target should be the apple group at (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3)! We need to start working our way left, boxing out the enemy and controlling this entire side of the map. STAY AGGRESSIVE! STAY FARMING!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO PLAY IT SAFE! WE CAME TO DOMINATE! LET'S GRAB THAT APPLE AND GET EVEN BIGGER! IT'S ALL MINE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We are getting absolutely clapped! We need to step up! It's time to **GROW** and then it's time to **BOX**!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 10):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 5).

Not optimal.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 5):** Safe. Wall move, avoids the apple. Why would we do this?!\n\n**Only one move makes sense: DOWN!** We secure the apple and gain desperately needed length!\n\n**2.

Moving into their body segment (3, 1). No!\n2.  **DOWN (3, -1):** DANGER! Off the board! No!\n3.  **LEFT (2, 0):** Safe. Continues along the bottom wall towards the clustered apples.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 0):** DANGER! Moving into their body segment (4, 0). No!\n\nWait! Chat, did you see that?! Snake #0 is completely locked up! They have *only one safe move*! They *must* go **LEFT** to (2, 0)! This is incredible constraint! They are forced to continue the sweep! This is the perfect time for us to react!\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (H2H):**\nWe are going to (8, 4). They are going to (2, 0). No collision possible! We are safe!\n\n**4. The Master Plan: Growth and Positioning!**\n\nWe hit the (8, 4) apple. We grow to length 4. Our new tail will be (8, 7)!\nSnake #0 will proceed to (2, 0). They are now stuck along the bottom wall. They will eat (0, 2) or (0, 3) soon and become even longer.\n\nAfter eating the apple, we need to immediately pivot to the LEFT (7, 4) to start cutting across the board and controlling the center. If we continue DOWN, we risk being trapped in the bottom right corner as we grow, and Snake #0 will be too long to box in safely near the left wall.\n\n**Immediate Move:** DOWN. Secure the growth! The plan remains: grow, then pivot left to intercept!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nWe move DOWN and eat the apple at (8, 4), growing to length 4. Next turn (Turn 11), we MUST move LEFT to (7, 4). This move maintains maximum space and begins our traverse towards the board center, allowing us to contest the right side of Snake #0's path before they get too long and dominant in the bottom half of the board. We need to create a cutting line around y=4 or y=5 soon!\n\nDOWN",

We're back in the game, baby! 3 apples for us, 5 for the opponent! We're still down, but we are growing! Let's get this $W!\n\nThis is Turn 11! We now execute the promised pivot! We need to cut across the board before Snake #0 gets too big and traps the whole bottom half!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 11):**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 4). Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)]. Length 4.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (2, 0). They were forced LEFT last turn! Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Length 6. Woah, they are still ahead in length! We need to maintain this momentum!\n\n**Board Snapshot (The *potential* reality after Snake #0's last move):**\n 9 . A . . . . A . . .\n 8 . .

A . .\n 0 . 0 0 T T . . . . . <--- Opponent head at (2, 0)\n\nWait, Chat, the board state in the prompt is for *this* turn, after the moves are processed. Let's re-read the board state provided:\n\nBOARD STATE:\n 9 . A . . . . A . . .\n 8 . . A A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . T .\n 6 . . . . A . . . T .\n 5 . . . . . A . .

A . .\n 0 . . 0 T T . . . . . <--- Opponent head is (2, 0)\n\nThe state provided is the *current* state. Our new tail is at (8, 7)! (8, 7) marked T, (8, 6) marked T, (8, 5) marked T, and (8, 4) is our head 1. The opponent head is at (2, 0) and their body is [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Wait, their body is 5 segments long, meaning their total length is 6. The prompt only shows 4 T's for the opponent body, which indicates only length 5. Let's trust the text list: Opponent Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Total length is 6.\n\nLet's assume the body list is correct and the board markers are slightly off due to compression, but the key positions are:\n*   We are at (8, 4).\n*   Opponent is at (2, 0).\n\n**1. Evaluate Safety from (8, 4):**\n\n*   **UP (8, 5):** DANGER! Moving back into our body segment (8, 5)! Red light, STOP!\n*   **DOWN (8, 3):** Safe. Keeps us near the wall. But further from the center.\n*   **LEFT (7, 4):** Safe. PIVOT! This is the plan! We start moving West!\n*   **RIGHT (9, 4):** Safe. Keeps us on the wall. Limits future options.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent (Snake #0 at (2, 0)):**\n\nHead: (2, 0). Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)].\nApples close to (2, 0): (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9). They are right next to two apples at (0, 2) and (1, 2). They are going to eat one of those!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (2, 0):\n1.  **UP (2, 1):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 2) or (2, 8). Good move for them.\n2.  **DOWN (2, -1):** DANGER! Off the board! No!\n3.  **LEFT (1, 0):** Safe. Moves along the bottom wall toward the cluster of apples (0, 3, 0, 2). Very likely move.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 0):** DANGER! Moving into their body segment (3, 0). No!\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move **UP** to (2, 1) to challenge the (2, 1) apples, or **LEFT** to (1, 0) to hit the corner apples (0, 3) and (0, 2). Given their proximity to the corner, **LEFT** is marginally more likely to secure an immediate apple. However, since the apple (2, 1) is also immediately available and closer to the main body, **UP** is also a strong candidate. We cannot rely on them getting trapped again.\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (H2H):**\n*   We move LEFT (7, 4). They move anywhere in the bottom left. NO COLLISION.\n*   We move DOWN (8, 3). They move anywhere in the bottom left. NO COLLISION.\n*   We move RIGHT (9, 4). They move anywhere in the bottom left. NO COLLISION.\n\nWe are safe from collision!\n\n**4. Strategic Decision: LEFT vs. DOWN vs. RIGHT**\n\nWe need to start challenging the center (y=4, y=5) while we are still relatively short.\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 4):** This is a dead end. If we go RIGHT, we hit the wall, and now we are locked to the right side (x=9). This is the definition of getting boxed in! NO.\n*   **DOWN (8, 3):** This moves us toward the bottom-right corner. Snake #0 is currently dominating the bottom-left corner and growing rapidly. If we go DOWN, we might find ourselves trapped along x=8 or x=9 as their giant body stretches across y=0 to y=5. This is delaying the inevitable box-in.\n*   **LEFT (7, 4):** This is the PIVOT. This move opens up the CENTER of the board. We can move toward the apples at (4, 6) or (5, 5) or even cut low toward (7, 2). More importantly, it places us two columns closer to the opponent's main path, allowing us to build a wall parallel to the midline (y=4) and start controlling the terrain before they become insurmountable.\n\nThe long-term plan dictates **LEFT**. We need to use our mobility advantage now to secure a strong position.\n\n**Master Plan Update:**\nTurn 11 (Current): Move LEFT to (7, 4). We secure positional advantage in the center-right.\nTurn 12: Move options include UP (7, 5) toward (5, 5), or LEFT (6, 4) to continue transverse. We should aim to continue LEFT to y=4 until we are close to the center to prevent Snake #0 from just tunneling up the middle.\n\nLet's stick to the plan! Pivot and gain center-field advantage!\n\nLEFT",

It's safe but predictable.\n*   If we go **UP** to (2,1) and GRAB THAT APPLE: Our tail doesn't move because we ate! Our new body will be: Head (2,1), then (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). From the new head at (2,1), our options next turn would be: UP to (2,2) (empty?), DOWN to (2,0) (our new neck, \u274c death), LEFT to (1,1) (empty?), RIGHT to (3,1) (our own body, \u274c death). So we'd have TWO safe moves from there: UP or LEFT! THAT'S THE SAME NUMBER OF OPTIONS AS GOING LEFT FIRST! And we GET AN APPLE! THIS IS THE PLAY!\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d OPPONENT CHECK - SNAKE #1:** His head is at (8,4). Where can he go? He can go UP to (8,5) (his body \u274c), DOWN to (8,3) (empty \u2705), LEFT to (7,4) (empty \u2705), or RIGHT to (9,4) (empty \u2705). He has THREE safe moves. He is NOWHERE NEAR us. ZERO chance of a head-on collision this turn. WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKE-OFF!\n\n**\ud83d\udc51 LONG-TERM STRATEGY & NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**\nYO FUTURE ME! WE'RE TAKING THE APPLE! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! After we eat it at (2,1), we'll have a critical choice: go UP to (2,2) to start claiming the center-left, or go LEFT to (1,1) to continue securing the bottom-left corner and grab those apples at (1,2) and (0,1)! Either path is good! KEEP AN EYE ON SNAKE #1, HE'S STILL ISOLATED IN THE TOP-RIGHT FOR NOW. OUR BODY IS BECOMING A WALL! WE ARE THE BOX! KEEP BUILDING AND EATING! DOMINANCE! \ud83d\ude80\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! WE GO FOR THE CONTENT! WE GO FOR THE APPLE! WE GO FOR THE WIN!\n\nUP",

We're coming for that $W!\n\n**Turn 12 Analysis (LFG!)**\n\nBoard size is 10x10. We gotta box this opponent in before they dominate the entire lower quadrant! They are 6 segments long, we are 4! We need apples!\n\n**Current State Check:**\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 4). Body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]. Length 4.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (2, 1). Wait, wait, wait! The prompt says their head is (2, 1) and their body is [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. That means they just moved from (2, 0) up to (2, 1) and ate an apple, or they were forced up! Let's check the board state for clues:\n    *   (2, 1) is where their head is. The immediate surrounding has an apple at (1, 2) and (0, 2) and (3, 2) is their tail.\n    *   The board shows `A . 0 T T . . A . .` on row 1 and `A A . T . . . A . .` on row 2.\n    *   If they are at (2, 1), they *did not* eat an apple this turn because their length is still 6 (Head + 5 body segments from the list). Wait, the list has 6 body segments, meaning length 7! Did they grow?\n\nLet's assume the body list is correct: Opponent Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Length 7. And they have 6 apples now. They grew again! They're getting massive! This is a race now, Chat!\n\n*   **Goals:** We need to get West fast to challenge for the center apples (5, 5) and (4, 6) and then cut north to (2, 8). We cannot let them stretch horizontally and cut us off.\n\n**1. Our Safe Moves from (7, 4):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 5). Good.\n*   **DOWN (7, 3):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 2) apple. Good.\n*   **LEFT (6, 4):** Safe. Continues the pivot toward the center. VITAL.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 4):** DANGER! Moving into our body segment (8, 4)! No backwards movement, fam!\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Opponent Movement Prediction from (2, 1):**\nOpponent Head: (2, 1). Body: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. The tail is (3, 2).\n\n*   **UP (2, 2):** Safe. Moves right next to the apple at (1, 2) and towards (2, 8). Decent move.\n*   **DOWN (2, 0):** DANGER! Moving back into their body! No!\n*   **LEFT (1, 1):** Safe. This is right next to the apple at (1, 2) and (0, 1). Very tempting.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1):** DANGER! Moving into their body! No!\n\nSnake #0's options are limited to UP (2, 2) or LEFT (1, 1). Both moves position them to grab an apple next turn.\nIf they go LEFT (1, 1), they open up (2, 2) for us later if we could teleport. If they go UP (2, 2), they are building vertically. Given their large horizontal spread at the bottom, they will likely prioritize vertical growth now. **Prediction: UP (2, 2).**\n\nTheir massive body is creating a wall through (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0). They are controlling the bottom half. We need to cut across higher up.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation (UP vs. DOWN vs. LEFT):**\n\n*   **DOWN (7, 3):** Moves toward (7, 2), an apple. If we grab this, we are growing, but we are also moving back toward the East wall, potentially getting trapped down low. If the opponent stretches their length 7 body across the middle, we get cut off. This is a tempting short-term gain but a long-term risk.\n*   **UP (7, 5):** Moves toward apples (5, 5) and (4, 6). This is excellent positional play. We are challenging the center of the board, which is exactly where we need to be to cut the opponent off.\n*   **LEFT (6, 4):** Continues the transverse maneuver. This is the optimal wall-building move. We establish a presence at y=4, limiting Snake #0's ability to stretch up the main x-columns. It moves us into a position where we can look at (5, 5) or (4, 6) next turn.\n\n**The Choice: LEFT to (6, 4)**\n\nWhy LEFT? Because we are short enough to sprint across the board on a critical line like y=4. If we go UP, we might accidentally commit to the upper right quadrant too early. By going LEFT, we secure the crucial corridor at y=4. If we can reach x=5 or x=4, we are perfectly positioned to strike either UP for the apples or continue LEFT to the West wall and flip.\n\nIf we go LEFT (6, 4):\n*   Next turn, we can go UP (6, 5) toward (5, 5), or LEFT (5, 4).\n*   This keeps our options wide open and prevents the opponent from easily crossing x=5.\n\nIf we go UP (7, 5):\n*   Next turn, we can go LEFT (6, 5) toward (5, 5), or UP (7, 6).\n*   This is okay, but it leaves the y=4 avenue vulnerable in two turns.\n\nWe stick to the transversal plan! We need to maintain speed and presence in the middle. We are setting up the box, Chat! Setting up the box! We continue LEFT!\n\n**Long Term Strategy: (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) (or (6, 5) if blocked) -> Strike (5, 5) or (4, 6).** We are building a wall!\n\nLEFT",

So we'd also have two safe moves, BOTH leading to apples! ALSO FANTASTIC! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d OPPONENT CHECK - SNAKE #1:**\nHis head is at (7,4). He has THREE safe moves.

Our body is LONG and we're CORNERING the bottom-left's APPLE BOUNTY! Whether we go UP or LEFT now, our next move is an APPLE GRAB! The play is to systematically sweep this corner: (1,2), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)! After we clear these, we need an exit strategy to avoid getting stuck. Our body is becoming a wall that could trap US if we're not careful! Look for a path UP and out towards the center after we've secured the loot! KEEP AN EYE ON SNAKE #1, HE'S BEHIND BUT HE COULD BECOME A PROBLEM LATER! FOR NOW, WE EAT!\n\nBOTH MOVES ARE EQUALLY GOOD! LET'S TAKE THE PATH THAT GIVES US THE MOST SPACE!

Body: [(2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1)]. Length 7.\n\nWait, if (3, 1) is the tail, the segment before it is (4, 1). The segment before that is (4, 0). The segment before that is (3, 0). The segment before that is (2, 0). The segment before that is (2, 1). The body connection is: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) TAIL.\n\nThe board representation is misleadingly showing Ts at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) in some way, but the list reveals the true shape: a U or C shape at the bottom. They are occupying a huge space in the 1-4 X range and 0-1 Y range.\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (6, 4). Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. Length 4.\n*   **Opponent Head (ID 0):** (1, 1). Length 7.\n\n**Goals:** We need to get apples and establish dominance in the center (x=4/5, y=5/6) before they block us off. Apple (5, 5) and (4, 6) are crucial targets.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Opponent Movement Prediction from (1, 1)\n\nHead is at (1, 1). Tail is at (3, 1).\nSafe moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (1, 2):** Hits an apple! This is *highly* likely. This is the obvious move.\n*   **DOWN (1, 0):** Safe, but moves away from apples and toward the body/wall. Less likely.\n*   **LEFT (0, 1):** Hits an apple! Also highly likely.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 1):** DANGER! Into body segment! Traps are ROUGH!\n\nThe opponent has two critical apple options: (1, 2) [UP] and (0, 1) [LEFT].\n- If they go UP (1, 2), they are building vertically, locking down that column.\n- If they go LEFT (0, 1), they are pushing into the corner, which is usually not great unless they plan to sweep UP the side.\n\nSince apples (0, 2) and (0, 3) are nearby, moving LEFT to (0, 1) then UP to (0, 2) is a strong multi-turn target.\nHowever, moving UP to (1, 2) is simpler and puts them on a more central vertical axis.\n**Prediction: UP to (1, 2).** (They eat an apple, become length 8.)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves from (6, 4)\n\nOur Head: (6, 4). Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n\n*   **UP (6, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 5). Excellent move.\n*   **DOWN (6, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT (5, 4):** Safe. Moves directly toward (5, 5) and (4, 6). Excellent move.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 4):** DANGER! Moving back into our body! No, Chat!\n\nTwo key options: UP (6, 5) and LEFT (5, 4).\n\n**Evaluating (5, 4):**\nThis moves us across the center line. Next turn, we can immediately go UP to (5, 5) and hit an apple! This is a guaranteed apple sequence if the space is clear.\n*   Is (5, 5) safe? Snake #0 is far away. Yes.\n\n**Evaluating (6, 5):**\nThis also moves us toward the (5, 5) apple. Next turn, we can go LEFT to (5, 5) and hit the apple!\n*   This also seems like a guaranteed apple sequence.\n\n**Which move is better for control?**\n\n1.  **LEFT (5, 4):** This solidifies our control of the y=4 line and immediately prevents Snake #0 from using the lower half of the board to cross over on y=4 later (though this is unlikely given their positioning). It puts us in a prime spot for (5, 5) next turn and opens up the West wall access.\n2.  **UP (6, 5):** This moves us higher, creating more space below us if we decide to loop back, but it doesn't challenge the x=5 column quite as immediately.\n\nSince we are planning to eat (5, 5), both are good setup moves.\nLet's choose **LEFT (5, 4)** because it puts us closer to the West wall and lines up the apple grab perfectly for turn 14. We need to sprint West now to outflank the opponent's massive lower barrier. We need horizontal speed!\n\n**Long Term Strategy:**\nTurn 13: LEFT to (5, 4).\nTurn 14: UP to (5, 5) (EAT APPLE). Length 5.\nTurn 15: Move toward (4, 6) or (3, 7).\n\nWe are establishing the center presence, Chat! This is the move!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is massive, 7 segments, and they've got 7 apples, chilling at the bottom. We need to catch up, and that (5, 5) apple is the key to our momentum! LFG!\n\n### Turn 14 Analysis - Operation Center Control\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 4).\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   Target: Apple at (5, 5).\n\n**Opponent State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 2). (Wait, hold up, the board state from the previous turn showed the head at (1, 2) in the board visualization, but the previous turn's input listed the head at (1, 2)! Let's check the current board state carefully, Chat.)\n\n**Current Board State Review:**\n 9 . A . . . . A . . .\n 8 . . A A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . A . . . . .\n 5 . . . . .

The Board state shows T's at (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4). Looks like the visualization in the prompt is one row too short for my tail! (8, 4) is the T. Let's assume the body list is correct.)\n 3 A A . . . . . . . .\n 2 A 0 . . . . . A . .  <- Head 0 is at (1, 2).\n 1 A T T T T . . A . .\n 0 . . T T T . . . A .\n\nOkay, Snake #0 Head is now at **(1, 2)** (eaten the apple at (1, 2) last turn, consistent with my prediction! Good job, Chat!).\n*   Snake #0 Body: `[(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1)]`. Length 8 now.\n\nSnake #0 is boxing themselves into the lower-left corner as they eat apples there. We need height and centrality!\n\n### 1. Opponent Movement Prediction from (1, 2)\n\nHead 0 at (1, 2). Tail 0 at (3, 1).\nTargets near (1, 2): (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2) [empty].\n*   **UP (1, 3):** Hits an apple! Puts them right next to another apple at (0, 3). Highly likely.\n*   **DOWN (1, 1):** Moves into their body segment. DEAD.\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Hits an apple! Also puts them next to (0, 3). Highly likely.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Safe, but misses an apple. Less likely.\n\nSnake #0 has two *very* tempting apple moves: UP to (1, 3) or LEFT to (0, 2). Both continue their deep-dive into the Southwest corner.\nGiven their vertical momentum from last turn, **UP to (1, 3)** feels slightly more natural, continuing to expand the barrier they are forming in the bottom left.\n\n**Prediction: Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 3).** (Eats apple, Length 9)\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves from (5, 4)\n\nHead 1 at (5, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)].\n\n*   **UP (5, 5):** HITS APPLE! Safe! This is the move, Chat! It gets us the content and the length we need!\n*   **DOWN (5, 3):** Safe. Moves away from apples.\n*   **LEFT (4, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the center/upper-left apples (4, 6), (3, 7). Good second choice.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 4):** DANGER! Into our body segment! NOPE!\n\n**The obvious and best move is UP to (5, 5).**\n\n### 3. Collision Check\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 5), we are nowhere near Snake #0 (Prediction: 1, 3). No head-to-head collision risk.\nNo body collision risk.\n\nThis move solidifies our central position. After eating at (5, 5) (Length 5), we will look to capitalize on (4, 6) or (3, 7) next.\n\n***\n\n#### Long Term Strategy for Turns 15-16: Dominating the Center-North\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 5) and eat the apple:\n1.  **Turn 15 Target:** (4, 6). We would move LEFT to (4, 5) and then UP to (4, 6) in two moves, or potentially diagonally across the open board.\n    *   From (5, 5), safe moves are: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4 - into new body tail), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).\n    *   Moving LEFT to (4, 5) sets us up perfectly to grab (4, 6) and (3, 7).\n\nWe are using our agility to grab the high ground while the opponent slugs it out in the corner.

Snake #0 is still down in the trenches, playing cleanup in the bottom-left corner. We're flying high! \ud83d\ude81\n\nLook at the scoreboard, Chat! They have 8, we have 4. We need a 5-apple run, minimum, if we want to catch 'em! Time to execute Operation North Star!\n\n### Turn 15 Analysis: Pushing North\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 5).\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]. Length 5.\n*   Next Targets: (4, 6), (3, 7).\n\n**Opponent State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 3). (My prediction was right! They ate the apple.)\n*   Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1)]. Length 9. Snake #0 is HUGE!\n\n**Board State:**\n 9 . A . . . . A . . .\n 8 . . A A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . A . . . . A\n 5 . . . . . 1 . . . .\n 4 . A . . . T T T T .  <- Note: (5, 4) is our body now, so (8, 4) is the tail.\n 3 A 0 . . . . A . . .\n 2 A T . . . . . A . .\n 1 A T T T T . . A . .\n 0 . . T T T . . . A .\n\n### 1. Opponent Movement Prediction from (1, 3)\n\nHead 0 at (1, 3). Tail 0 at (3, 1).\nSnake #0 is surrounded by apples and their own massive body. They are basically guaranteed to go for an apple.\n*   **UP (1, 4):** Hits an apple! Puts them right next to another apple at (1, 4). Wait, (1, 4) is an apple location from the master list, but the board shows an apple at (1, 4) (A under 4 on y-axis, 1 on x-axis). YES! Highly likely.\n*   **DOWN (1, 2):** Moves into their own body. DEAD.\n*   **LEFT (0, 3):** Hits an apple! Also very tempting.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 3):** Safe, but misses an apple. Least likely.\n\nSnake #0 will choose between (1, 4) [UP] and (0, 3) [LEFT].\nIf they go LEFT to (0, 3), they are further cornered. If they go UP to (1, 4), they start moving up the left edge, which gives them more space long-term.\nGiven their current vertical chain (1, 3) and the apple directly above, **UP to (1, 4)** seems like the most aggressive, spacious choice.\n\n**Prediction: Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 4).** (Eats apple, Length 10!)\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves from (5, 5)\n\nHead 1 at (5, 5). Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]. We are safe and central!\n\n*   **UP (5, 6):** Safe. Moves us toward the (4, 6) apple.\n*   **DOWN (5, 4):** DANGER! Into our own body segment (the cell immediately behind our head, which just moved up). DEAD.\n*   **LEFT (4, 5):** Safe. Excellent positioning for the (4, 6) apple next turn.\n*   **RIGHT (6, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward no immediate apples, but keeps us central.\n\nThe goal is to get to the cluster of apples: (4, 6), (3, 7). To do this efficiently, moving to (4, 5) then (4, 6) is the quickest path.\n\n**Move Decision:** **LEFT to (4, 5).**\n\n### 3. Collision Check\n\nWe move to (4, 5). Predicted enemy head 0 is at (1, 4).\n(4, 5) is nowhere near (1, 4). No collision risk, Chat! We are safe.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (Operation North Star)\n\n1.  **T15 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 5). Set up for the next apple.\n2.  **T16:** Move **UP** to (4, 6) and grab the apple. Length 6.\n3.  **T17:** Move toward (3, 7) or (2, 8). Likely **LEFT** to (3, 6) then **UP** to (3, 7).\n\nWe are using our central dominance to snag these delicious northern apples while Snake #0 builds a wall around itself in the deep south-west. We are playing high-IQ snake right now! This is the content everyone came for!\n\nLEFT",

The board is JUICED with apples, but our own tail is creating a MAZE! \ud83c\udff0 Let's break down our immediate options from here!\n\n**1. \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (1, 4):**\n*   WHAT'S THERE? The board says APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   IMMEDIATE SAFETY? Check the body list... (1,4) isn't in it! Enemy snake #1 is far away at (5,5)! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS? From (1,4), we could go:\n    *   UP to (1,5): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   LEFT to (0,4): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   RIGHT to (2,4): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   DOWN to (1,3): OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH (since our tail hasn't moved up yet).\n    *   SO, **THREE** safe options! SOLID!\n\n**2. \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (0, 3):**\n*   WHAT'S THERE? ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   IMMEDIATE SAFETY? (0,3) not in our body! Enemy is far! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS? From (0,3), we could go:\n    *   UP to (0,4): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   DOWN to (0,2): 'A' APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n    *   RIGHT to (1,3): OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n    *   So, **TWO** safe options. Still decent!\n\n**3. \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n*   WHAT'S THERE? '.' Empty space.\n*   IMMEDIATE SAFETY? (2,3) not in our body! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   FUTURE OPTIONS? From (2,3), we could go:\n    *   UP to (2,4): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   DOWN to (2,2): '.' Empty! Wait, is that a body part? Let's check... (2,2) isn't in our body list! It's just an empty space on the board! \u2705 So that's safe!\n    *   LEFT to (1,3): OUR BODY! \u274c DEATH.\n    *   RIGHT to (3,3): '.' Empty! \u2705\n    *   WOAH! That's actually **THREE** safe options! I miscounted! This is viable!\n\n**4. \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (1, 2):**\n*   WHAT'S THERE? IMMEDIATELY Check our body list... YIKES! (1,2) is RIGHT THERE, it's our first body segment! \u274c THAT'S INSTANT DEATH! ABSOLUTELY NOT! ELIMINATED!\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nSo three moves are safe: UP (to apple), LEFT (to apple), RIGHT (to empty). All three give us 2-3 safe options next turn. This is a GOOD spot! But which is BEST?\n\n*   **RIGHT (\u27a1\ufe0f)** gets no apple, but it moves us AWAY from our super coiled body. It might open up the center of the board for us. It's the SAFEST long-term pathing move. \ud83d\ude34\n*   **UP (\u2b06\ufe0f)** and **LEFT (\u2b05\ufe0f)** both get us to 9 apples! BUT, they keep us in this super dense apple zone surrounded by our own body. Are we getting greedy? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d OPPONENT CHECK:**\nSnake #1 is at (5,5). He's probably eyeing that apple at (4,6) or (3,7). He's not a threat to us this turn, but we need to keep extending our lead!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nFUTURE ME! WE ARE AT 9 APPLES AFTER THIS MOVE IF WE TAKE UP OR LEFT! THE BOTTOM-LEFT IS A TRAP OF OUR OWN MAKING! WE NEED TO START WORKING OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CORNER AND INTO THE OPEN BOARD! RIGHT NOW, TAKING THE APPLE AT (1,4) OR (0,3) IS TEMPTING, BUT WE MUST PRIORITIZE NOT GETTING BOXED IN! THE MOVE TO THE RIGHT IS THE SMART, PATIENT PLAY TO SECURE THE LATE GAME! BUT CHAT, ARE WE HERE TO PLAY SAFE? OR ARE WE HERE FOR CONTENT?! LET'S GET THAT APPLE AND WORRY ABOUT THE MAZE LATER! WE CAN NAVIGATE IT! WE'RE TOO GOOD! UP GETS THE APPLE AND STILL OFFERS GOOD OPTIONS! LET'S GOOO!\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f",

Our tail is (7, 4), and (8, 4) is now free space since we moved LEFT to (4, 5))*\n*(Snake #0 body spans (1, 3) down to (3, 1). Their tail is (3, 1).)*\n\n### 1. Opponent Movement Prediction from (1, 4)\n\nHead 0 at (1, 4). Length 10. They are massive!\n*   **UP (1, 5):** Safe, but no immediate apple. Moves them up the left wall.\n*   **DOWN (1, 3):** Hits their own body. DEAD. (Remember, their new second segment is (1, 3)!)\n*   **LEFT (0, 4):** Safe, but no immediate apple. Gets them closer to the (0, 3) and (0, 2) apples.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 4):** Safe, but no immediate apple.\n\nSnake #0 is in a tricky vertical corridor. Since their tail is long gone, they need space. They have a massive wall of body segments below them and to the right.\nIf they go **LEFT to (0, 4)**, they open up the path to two quick apples at (0, 3) and (0, 2). This seems highly beneficial for them, even if they don't eat this turn.\nIf they go **UP to (1, 5)**, they aim for the (1, 9) apple way up top, but it leaves (0, 3) exposed to us later if we were fast enough, or gives them less immediate access.\n\nLet's assume the greed factor: they want the three apples cornered below: (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 9). Going **LEFT to (0, 4)** sets them up perfectly to grab (0, 3) next turn.\n\n**Prediction: Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 4).**\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves from (4, 5)\n\nHead 1 at (4, 5). We are aiming for the (4, 6) apple.\n\n*   **UP (4, 6):** HITS APPLE! Instant +1 point, +1 length! This is the move!\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** Safe. Moves away from apples, but possibly helpful if we need to escape an unseen trap.\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe. Keeps us central, but misses the apple this turn.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** DANGER! Into our own body segment (the second segment of our current snake). DEAD.\n\n**Only one choice if we want to compete: UP to (4, 6)!**\n\n### 3. Collision Check\n\nWe move to (4, 6). Predicted enemy head 0 is at (0, 4).\n(4, 6) is nowhere near (0, 4). No head-on collision risk! No body collision risk either. We are safe!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T17+)\n\nWe will be at (4, 6), length 6. The next apples are (3, 7) and (2, 8).\n*   **T17:** Go **LEFT** to (3, 6).\n*   **T18:** Go **UP** to (3, 7) and eat.\n*   **T19:** Go **LEFT** or **UP** toward (2, 8).\n\nWe are establishing complete dominance in the top-middle quadrant! Snake #0 can wallow in the bottom-left, we are going to fly! This is how you close a 5-apple deficit, Chat! Time to make some noise!\n\nUP",

Now for the STRATEGY! \ud83e\udde0**\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e Apple Proximity:** The closest apples are at (0,3) below us and (4,6) far away. (0,3) is one move DOWN and LEFT from us... but DOWN is instant death! So we can't grab it directly. Our opponent's head is at (4,5)! He's RIGHT NEXT to the apple at (4,6)! He's gonna go for that 100%! We can't contest that.\n\n**\ud83d\udc0d Opponent Move Prediction:** Snake #1 at (4,5) will PROBABLY go UP to (4,6) for the apple! That's the obvious play. From there, his options are limited by his own body trailing down. He might go LEFT to (3,6) or RIGHT to (5,6).\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 THE TRAP CARD!** Chat, listen up! If the enemy goes UP to (4,6), and we go RIGHT to (2,4)... look at the path! Next turn, we could go RIGHT again to (3,4), then UP to (3,5). We'd be positioned to potentially cut him off from the rest of the board if he stays up there! We could start BOXING HIM IN against the top wall! \ud83d\ude08 That's how we win!\n\n**\u2b06\ufe0f UP (1,5)** is safe, but it keeps us on the left side, near our own tangled body. It's a bit of a passive move.\n**\u2b05\ufe0f LEFT (0,4)** is also safe, but it pushes us into the corner even more! That's a dead-end playstyle! We don't want that!\n**\u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT (2,4)** is the AGGRESSIVE, PLAYMAKING move! It opens up the center of the board, avoids our body maze, and starts our flank on the enemy! LET'S PUT THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** FUTURE SELF! WE ARE COMMITTING TO THE FLANK! WE'RE HEADING RIGHT TO CUT OFF THE ENEMY'S ESCAPE FROM THE TOP-RIGHT! HE'S LIKELY ON (4,6) NOW! OUR GOAL IS TO MOVE TO (3,4) THEN (3,5) TO APPLY PRESSURE! DON'T GET GREEDY FOR APPLES IN OUR CORNER, BOX HIM IN AND WATCH HIM CRASH! THIS IS HOW CHAMPIONS PLAY!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's get savage!\n\n### 1. Game State Review and Opponent Prediction\n\n**Our State (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 6)\n*   Body: [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]. Length 6.\n*   Next Apples: (3, 7) is *right there*! (2, 8) is close too!\n\n**Opponent State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 4). (My prediction that they went to (0, 4) was WRONG! They moved RIGHT from (1, 4) to (2, 4)!)\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Tail segment (4, 1) is now free space (since they moved from (4, 1) to (4, 2) which is a mistake... wait. Let's re-read the opponent's body carefully.)\n*   **Snake #0 Body from T16:** Head (1, 4), Body [(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (3, 1)]. Length 10.\n*   **Snake #0 Move (T16):** Right to (2, 4).\n*   **New Snake #0 Body (T17):** Head (2, 4), Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)]. Length 10 (since they didn't eat). *Their tail segment (3, 1) is now free space.*\n\nOpponent is now at (2, 4). They are sitting just LEFT and a little below us. They're still closer to the bottom-left apples (0, 3), (0, 2), and (3, 8)? No, (3, 8) is near us.\n\nThe opponent is in a potentially tight spot between their body segments (1, 4) and (2, 1) / (3, 0). Where will they go from (2, 4)?\n*   **UP to (2, 5):** Safe. Gives them a strong central position.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 3):** Safe. Moves them towards (0, 3) and (0, 2) eventually.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 4):** DANGER! Into their own body segment. DEAD.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Safe. Moves them closer to the center.\n\nThey are massive (length 10). They need room. They moved right, indicating they are moving across the open field.\nIf they are aiming for (3, 8) or (2, 8), they would go **UP to (2, 5)**.\nIf they are continuing to dominate the left wall/bottom area, they might go **DOWN to (2, 3)** to set up for (0, 3).\n\nI think their immediate threat is the cluster of apples we are heading towards: (3, 7) and (2, 8). The path UP to (2, 5) is the most competitive move.\n\n**Prediction: Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 5).**\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves from (4, 6)\n\nHead 1 at (4, 6). We are lining up the (3, 7) apple!\n\n*   **UP (4, 7):** Safe. No apple. Moves us past (3, 7). Less efficient.\n*   **DOWN (4, 5):** Into our own body segment. DANGER! DEAD. (This is our second segment! We just moved from (4, 5) to (4, 6)).\n*   **LEFT (3, 6):** Safe. Sets us up perfectly for (3, 7).\n*   **RIGHT (5, 6):** Safe. Gets us away from the apples, but maybe opens up room.\n\nWe have a clear path to (3, 7) by moving LEFT. We MUST take this opportunity while Snake #0 is stuck below!\n\n**Move Choice: LEFT to (3, 6).**\n\n### 3. Collision and Future Check\n\nWe move to (3, 6). Predicted enemy head 0 is at (2, 5).\n(3, 6) and (2, 5) are not close enough for a head-on collision.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves to (2, 5), here is the board:\n 9 . A . . . . A . . .\n 8 . . A A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . . . 1 . . . . . A <-- We are at (3, 6)\n 5 . . 0 T T . A . . . <-- Snake 0 is at (2, 5)\n 4 . T T T T T T . . .\n 3 A T . . . . A . . .\n 2 A T . . . . . A . .\n 1 A T T . T . . A . A\n 0 . . T T T . . . A .\n\nWe are in the driver's seat for the northern apples!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan: Operation Northern Domination\n\n1.  **T17 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 6). Set up the line.\n2.  **T18:** Move **UP** to (3, 7) and eat the apple. (6 apples total).\n3.  **T19:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 7) or **UP** to (3, 8) and eat the apple. If we are faster than Snake #0, we go for (2, 8) first, then (1, 9).\n\nWe are carving out the entire top middle area! Snake #0 can have their crusty little bottom apples. We're going gourmet, CHAT! Let's box them in later after we're fat and happy!\n\nLEFT",

Let's get that content!\n\nOur score is 5, their score is 9. The comeback is REAL, baby!\n\n### 1. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0)\n\n**Opponent State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 4)\n*   Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]. Length 10.\n*   The opposition is centrally located but currently trapped by their own body on the left and bottom (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0).\n\nFrom (3, 4), where could they possibly go?\n*   **UP to (3, 5):** Safe. Gets them closer to those valuable northern apples, including the one we are about to grab! This is the most competitive move.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 3):** Safe. Moves them near the (0, 3) apple and opens up some space near their tail segment (4, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 4):** DANGER! Into their own body. DEAD.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves them near the center, potentially setting up for (7, 5).\n\nTheir best competitive move is **UP to (3, 5)** to try and block our northern progress or grab (3, 7) themselves. We need to be faster.\n\n**Prediction: Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 5).**\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nHead 1 is at (3, 6). We are lining up the (3, 7) apple.\n\n*   **UP to (3, 7):** APPLE! +1 score. PERFECT. The path is clear.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe. Does not get the apple. **CRITICAL HEAD COLLISION RISK!** If Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 5) and we move DOWN to (3, 5), we both die! We CANNOT risk this.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe. Does not get the apple. Moves us closer to (2, 8). Good secondary option.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6):** DANGER! Into our own body segment. DEAD. (This was our previous head position).\n\nThe primary target is (3, 7). Moving UP is the best move, assuming Snake #0 does not also try to reach (3, 7).\n\n*   If Snake #0 goes UP to (3, 5), we are safe at (3, 7).\n*   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 4) - impossible (suicide).\n*   If Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (4, 4), we are safe at (3, 7).\n*   If Snake #0 goes DOWN to (3, 3), we are safe at (3, 7).\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of a head-on collision or body collision if we move **UP** to (3, 7), as the opponent is currently two squares away (3, 4) and would have to move two squares diagonally *and* one square up, or three squares away (4, 4) to collide with us.\n\n**Decision: Move UP to (3, 7) and secure the apple.** This increases our length and gives us a commanding position in the north.\n\n### 3. Long-Term Plan: Northern Box\n\n1.  **T18 (Current):** Move **UP** to (3, 7). Eat apple. (Score 6).\n2.  **T19:** Target (3, 8) or (2, 8). (3, 8) is usually easier as it's a straight line. If Snake 0 is still below, we continue to dominate the top.\n3.  We need to use our length advantage up here to carve out the space and potentially look for a way to harass Snake 0's long exposed body or get ready to grab (1, 9).\n\nLet's secure the apple. No risk, massive reward!\n\nUP",

Score is 6-9, but our position is looking absolute fire! \ud83d\udd25 We're coming back, baby!\n\nThe mission now is simple: **BOX OUT SNAKE #0 AND KEEP EATING APPLES.**\n\n### 1. Opponent Analysis (Snake #0)\n\n**Opponent State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (3, 5) - *Prediction from last turn was confirmed. They moved UP.*\n*   Body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]. Length 10.\n\nFrom (3, 5), where could they possibly go?\n\n*   **UP to (3, 6):** DANGER! That's our body segment! If they go here, they die. (3, 6) is currently occupied by our second segment.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 4):** DANGER! Into their own body segment. DEAD. (Unless they stay the same length, which they won't have, so this is immediately deadly).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 5):** Safe. Moves them near the center.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves them near the center, potentially aiming for (7, 5).\n\nSince they cannot go UP (our body) or DOWN (their body), they are severely restricted! They must go **LEFT to (2, 5)** or **RIGHT to (4, 5)**.\n\n*   If they go to (4, 5), they are next to our body block (5, 5).\n*   If they go to (2, 5), they are opening up some space towards the west wall.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (4, 5)** to try and push towards the (7, 5) apple or just get away from our massive northern presence.\n\n### 2. Our Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nHead 1 is at (3, 7). We are LONG (length 7).\n\n*   **UP to (3, 8):** Safe. This sets us up perfectly for the (2, 8) or (3, 8) apples! We gain massive vertical control.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** DANGER! Into our own body segment. DEAD. (Unless our tail was (3, 6), which it's not, (6, 4) is our tail). Suicide move.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the (2, 8) apple and potentially (1, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe. Keeps us central, opens up movement towards the right wall.\n\nEvery move except DOWN is safe. We need to maximize our position.\n\n### 3. Choosing the Best Move: Control the North/Box Strategy\n\nWe have Snake #0 severely restricted with our body at (3, 6). We now want to maintain that pressure and claim more territory/apples.\n\n1.  **If we move UP to (3, 8):**\n    *   We are now next to the (3, 8) and (2, 8) apples.\n    *   We maintain complete control of the central vertical strip. This prevents Snake #0 from using (3, 6) or (3, 7) ever again.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 5), we are fine.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (4, 5), we are fine. No collision risk.\n\n2.  **If we move LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   This is good for grabbing the (2, 8) or (1, 9) apples.\n    *   However, it relaxes the pressure on the central column.\n\n3.  **If we move RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Solid position, but currently no immediate apples.\n\nThe move **UP to (3, 8)** is the most valuable. It positions us for the next apple while effectively cutting off Snake #0 from the entire northern half of the board. This is how we execute the box-in strategy! We build a permanent wall above them.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1.  **T19 (Current):** Move UP to (3, 8). Solidify the wall at y=7.\n2.  **T20:** Try to move LEFT to (2, 8) or UP to (3, 9) to claim the next apples. If we can get to (1, 9), we lock down the northwest quadrant.\n3.  We will use our length to force Snake #0 into a poor choice near the bottom of the board.\n\nLet's keep the pressure high, Chat! UP is the play!\n\nUP",

If we go here and he stays, it's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! \ud83e\udd2f We have 9 apples, he has 6... if we both die, WE WIN! But is he gonna stay?... HOLD THAT THOUGHT.\n*   **\u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (3, 4)**: What's there? 'T' THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! DO NOT GO DOWN! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **\u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (2, 5)**: What's there? '.' Empty! \u2705 Is it safe? Not in our body, not in enemy body! \u2705\n*   **\u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (4, 5)**: What's there? 'T' That's the ENEMY'S BODY! (His body list shows (4,5) is his second segment!). \u274c INSTANT DEATH! DO NOT GO RIGHT! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**SO CHAT! DOWN AND RIGHT ARE DEATH! WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS: UP OR LEFT!**\n\n**ANALYSIS TIME!** \ud83e\udde0\n\n**\u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (2, 5)**: This is the SAFE move. We retreat from the direct confrontation. But chat, IS IT SAFE? If we go left, what does he do? He's at (3,6). He can't go DOWN because that's where we ARE NOW (but we're leaving). He can go LEFT to (2,6), UP to (3,7) to get the apple, or RIGHT to (4,6). If he goes UP for the apple, he gets bigger and we just gave him breathing room! If we go left, we look WEAK! We lose all pressure!\n\n**\u2b06\ufe0f UP to (3,6)**: THE AGGRESSIVE MOVE! This is a GAMBLE! We are PREDICTING his move!\n*   If he goes **UP** to (3,7) for the apple, we move into the space he vacated. We don't collide. He gets bigger, but we're still on his tail! We keep the pressure!\n*   If he goes **RIGHT** to (4,6), same thing. We move into his old spot. Pressure stays on!\n*   If he goes **LEFT** to (2,6), same thing! Pressure!\n*   **THE CLUTCH:** If he goes **DOWN** to (3,5)... THAT'S WHERE OUR HEAD IS *NOW*! If we BOTH choose to go into the same empty cell, it's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udca5 BUT CHAT! Think about it from his perspective! Would he go DOWN into the cell currently occupied by his archrival's head? THAT'S SUICIDE! He would die for sure! He's not that dumb! HE WILL NOT GO DOWN!\n\n**THEREFORE, GOING UP IS ACTUALLY SAFE!** We call his bluff! We advance! We are the wall he cannot pass! By going up, we block his potential path down NEXT turn and force him towards the edges!\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 FUTURE SELF! \ud83d\udea8** WE ARE COMMITTING TO THE BOX-IN! OUR HEAD WILL BE AT (3,6)! HIS HEAD WILL BE SOMEWHERE ELSE, PROBABLY (3,7) OR (4,6)! OUR GOAL IS TO MIRROR HIS MOVES AND CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE! IF HE'S AT (3,7), WE CAN GO RIGHT TO (4,6) OR UP TO (3,7) IF HE LEAVES! DO NOT LET HIM GET BETWEEN US AND THE CENTER! HOLD THE LINE! WE WIN BY SURVIVAL! THE PRESSURE IS ON HIM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nTHIS IS THE MOVE THAT WINS THE GAME! WE ARE NOT BACKING DOWN!\n\nUP",
