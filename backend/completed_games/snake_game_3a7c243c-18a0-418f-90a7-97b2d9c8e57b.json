Body: None.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3, 4). Score: 0. Body: None.\n*   Apples: (4, 5), (9, 5), (8, 9), (4, 1), (2, 0)\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n\n*   The enemy snake's head is dangerously close to your head. If they move (likely up) and you move (likely down), it's a direct head-on collision.\n*   The apple at (4, 5) is a good target. However, it is directly in the path of the enemy's possible upward movement.\n\n**Possible Moves and Analysis:**\n\n*   **UP:** Avoids immediate collision with enemy, but the apple at (4,5) is blocked. May create a dead end.\n*   **DOWN:** Avoids immediate collision, but the apple at (4,5) is blocked. Might make it more difficult to grow.\n*   **LEFT:** Avoids immediate collision but may result in being trapped in a corner with the enemy snake.\n*   **RIGHT:** Avoids immediate collision, but the apple at (4,5) is blocked. Potentially better if the enemy snake is forced to move to the right.\n\nGiven the close proximity and the blocking of the apple at (4,5), the best strategy is to try to avoid a collision, while still being able to reach the apples.\n\nI'm going to try to move right, taking advantage of the distance from the enemy. If the enemy snake can't utilize the apple at (9,5) (due to the collision), I can potentially eat it.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n\nMy primary goal is to increase my score safely. I'll prioritize moving in a direction that avoids collisions, allows me to reach apples, and avoids creating immediate dead ends. I should also try to anticipate the enemy's potential moves. If the enemy moves up, I should move down to avoid a collision.\n\nUP",

It also maintains a somewhat open path to potentially avoid Snake #0 if needed.\n\nLet's briefly consider the enemy's potential moves. Snake #0 is at (4, 3). If they move up, they will go to (4, 4). If they move left, they go to (3, 3). If they move right, they move to (5, 3). If they move down, they will go to (4, 2). Considering this, moving right is the best option, as it makes it safe to progress toward the apple.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

It also doesn't directly help me towards the apple at (4,5).\n*   **DOWN:**  Moving down would bring me to (8, 4), which is a bit too far away from the apples.\n*   **LEFT:** Moving left would bring me to (7, 5), the same as the UP option.\n*   **RIGHT:** This would move me to (9, 5), which is directly towards the apple at (9, 5). It's a good move to get closer. I also need to consider Snake #0's possible moves. If Snake #0 moves right, they will be at (5, 3). If Snake #0 moves down, they will be at (4, 2).
