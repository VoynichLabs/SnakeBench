This secures a string of points, pushes the enemy into the lower\u2011left corner, and leaves us with plenty of escape routes.\n\n**\ud83d\udccb Short\u2011Term Plan**  \n1. **UP** to (6,\u202f7).  \n2. **UP** again \u2192 apple at (6,\u202f8) (+1).  \n3. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,\u202f8) apple (+1).  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,\u202f8) apple (+1).  \n5. From there, snake the opponent into the bottom\u2011left trap while we harvest the remaining high\u2011value apples.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Bottom line:** Grab the vertical lane, dominate the apple mountain, and keep the rival boxed.\n\nUP",

Let me break this down:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Your snake: Head at (5,5), 0 apples, just a head\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (6,9), Body [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5)], 10 apples\n- Enemy has a 10-segment body blocking columns 8-9\n\n**Immediate Threats:**\n- UP to (5,6): **SAFE** - open space\n- DOWN to (5,4): **SAFE** - open space\n- LEFT to (4,5): **SAFE** - open space\n- RIGHT to (6,5): **DEAD** - that's part of enemy body!\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\nThis fool is up 10-0 and has a massive body blocking the right side. I need to be SMART and start climbing up while avoiding that body. The enemy's head is at (6,9) so I need to watch out for a head-on collision if we both go UP.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: Good escape route, moves me away from enemy territory\n- DOWN: Retreats but keeps me safe, opens up board control\n- LEFT: Good escape route, avoids enemy territory\n\n**My Move:**\nI'm going **UP** to (5,6)! This keeps me safe from the enemy's body and gives me space to maneuver. I can start working my way around the board to find apples while avoiding that massive enemy snake. Plus, I need to start eating apples to catch up on the scoreboard!\n\nUP",
