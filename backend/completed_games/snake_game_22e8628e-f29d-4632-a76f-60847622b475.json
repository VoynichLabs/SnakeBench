No move immediately kills me, and none of our snakes have bodies yet, so we\u2019re clear to be ruthless.\n\nGiven we\u2019re tied 0-0, I want to start claiming the center field and begin herding Snake #0 down from the top. Heading LEFT will start us closing the gap horizontally without committing too deep too fast, and it keeps several safe follow-ups open (UP and DOWN still available) so we can pivot toward him or dodge his plays. We\u2019re not chasing apples blindly\u2014we\u2019re building pressure.\n\nPlan: Continue edging toward the middle and cut off their escape routes over the next couple turns, forcing them into the lower half and hoping for a head-on if we can maintain a higher score.\n\nLEFT",

Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate, but first\u2014survive this turn.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\nFrom (4,9):\n- UP \u2192 (4,10) \u2192 off board (y=10 invalid) \u274c DEAD.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 empty on board \u2705 safe for now.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 empty \u2705 safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,9) \u2192 has an apple 'A' \u2705 safe (apple doesn't kill).\n\nNo body yet, so no self-collision. Enemy body empty too. So all but UP are safe from immediate death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (7,1). Possible moves: UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1). All are empty except maybe apples. He's far from me (difference y=8, x=3), so no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We need to grow and cut off his space. He's in bottom right area, I'm top middle. I should move toward center to control board and maybe trap him later. Also, getting apples early gives length advantage for head-on wins.\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n- DOWN to (4,8): moves me toward center, keeps options open.\n- LEFT to (3,9): edge of board, limits future moves.\n- RIGHT to (5,9): gets apple immediately (grow to length 2), puts me near right edge though.\n\nRight gets an apple, grows me, score 1-0. That's good for future head-on clashes. But being at (5,9) next turn, I'll have body at (4,9). Possible next moves from there: down, left, right (up off board). That's fine.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** After eating apple, move down toward center, avoid getting pinned on top row. Watch enemy movement\u2014maybe he goes for apples at (7,3) or (9,1). We'll try to cut off his expansion.\n\n**FINAL PICK:** I'm taking the apple for early lead. Aggressive growth! Let's go! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

He can go UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1), RIGHT (7,1). All are empty. He might go for apple at (7,3) eventually, or (9,1) nearby. Right now he's far from me (y difference 8), so no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\n**SCORE & GROWTH:** I have 1 apple, he has 0. If I take the apple at (6,9), I grow to length 3, score 2-0. That's a bigger length advantage for future head-on clashes! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS:**\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,9) and eat apple:\n  - Next turn head at (6,9), body at (5,9) and (4,9).\n  - From (6,9): UP off board \u274c, DOWN (6,8) maybe safe, LEFT (5,9) my body \u274c, RIGHT (7,9) apple? Actually board shows (7,9) is apple 'A'. So RIGHT would be safe and eat another apple next turn potentially. But that could trap me on right edge. Need to plan escape downward soon.\n\n- If I go DOWN to (5,8):\n  - Next turn head at (5,8), body at (5,9) and (4,9).\n  - From (5,8): UP (5,9) my body \u274c, DOWN (5,7) safe, LEFT (4,8) safe, RIGHT (6,8) safe. More options open, but no immediate growth.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Early game, grow fast to dominate. With length advantage, I can be more aggressive and force head-on collisions where I win. Taking the apple now gets me to length 3 vs his length 1. That's huge! Then next turn, from (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8) to get off the top row and toward center, avoiding getting pinned.\n\n**RISK:** Going RIGHT eats apple but leaves me at (6,9) with only DOWN and RIGHT as possible safe moves next turn (UP off board, LEFT into body). That's a bit risky if enemy approaches, but he's far away. I'll have time to maneuver.\n\n**VERDICT:** Take the apple! Grow that lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

My head is chilling at (6,2) with zero body to worry about, so let\u2019s break down these options before we pounce:\n\n- UP to (6,3): keeps me climbing toward their turf, keeps three clean escape routes, and keeps (6,4) accessible if I need to pop a quick apple (but I\u2019m watching Snake #0, not just fruit). I\u2019m keeping my options open to swing east or west depending on their shift.\n- DOWN to (6,1): hugging the wall and retracing steps. Doesn\u2019t box them in or pressure their northern play. That\u2019s a passive trap set for ME, not them.\n- LEFT to (5,2) or RIGHT to (7,2): both safe but don\u2019t advance the choke; just sidestepping when I should be looming over their center column at (6,x). I want them feeling boxed, not breathing easy.\nSo the cleanest pressure move is UP\u2014keep stacking toward their cluster and force them into a head-on if they dare overcommit below me. I\u2019m staying aggressive, stayin\u2019 aware, and not letting #0 breathe easy in the top half! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc0d\n\nPlan for the next stretch: Keep ratcheting north and then drift left to corral Snake #0 against the upper wall, forcing them toward that 0-body choke at (5-4,9). If they try to slip south, I\u2019m ready to snap the trap shut with a double-down head-on! \ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

I don't *need* to greed for another apple right now. Getting trapped in the corner could let the enemy grow freely in the open board. Better to stay mobile, keep options open, and start moving toward the center to pressure him. From (6,8) I can go down/left/right next turn and maybe cut off his paths. With my length advantage, I can aim to box him in later.\n\n**VERDICT:** Play it safe, keep mobility, deny him space! DOWN to (6,8)!\n\nDOWN",

I can try to get above him and slowly descend, boxing him against bottom wall. With my length, I can create barriers.\n\n**VERDICT:** DOWN to (6,7)!

Risky). Puts me closer to apples at (6,4)? Actually apple at (6,4) is gone? Wait board shows (6,4) is '1' (his head). So apple there is eaten.

If I try to force the column 6 squeeze by going straight into them, it\u2019s a double KO risk and I\u2019m down a snake and the lead. Left would be safe, but it starts drifting me away from the choke I\u2019ve been squeezing and gives the rival an easy lane to slip down into (6,5) while I\u2019m backing off.\n\nSo I\u2019m flipping to the RIGHT into (7,5). That keeps me adjacent to their column, still threatening that middle corridor, and keeps my escape routes open\u2014no walls, no bodies in the immediate vicinity. I stay aggressive, still zoning the board around their head while keeping more follow-up choices than a head-on brawl would allow. Score\u2019s 1 vs 2, so I\u2019m not letting them breathe, but I\u2019m also not throwing away the game for a risky smash.\n\nPlan: Stay glued to their vertical line, circle through the lower row (y=5) to force them into a corner, and be ready to cut off their retreat if they drop down into my old space.\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S CHECK THE BOARD!\n\n**MY SITUATION:**\n- Head: (6,6)\n- Body: [(6,7), (6,8)] \u2014 so my tail is at (6,8), neck at (6,7).\n- Length 3 vs his length 2. I'M LONGER! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION:**\n- Head: (6,5) \u2014 RIGHT BELOW ME! VERTICAL STANDOFF CONTINUES!\n- Body: [(6,4)] \u2014 so his tail is at (6,4), neck at (6,4)? Wait, his body list is just one segment? Actually his body is [(6,4)] meaning his head is at (6,5), tail at (6,4). So his snake length is 2.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 MY OWN BODY! \u274c SELF-COLLISION.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 ENEMY HEAD CURRENTLY THERE! But we move simultaneously \u2014 if I go DOWN and he stays still or moves elsewhere, I'd land where his head WAS. But if he moves UP into (6,6) at the same time, we'd head-on collide! That's a DOUBLE KO! But I have higher score (2 vs 1), so I'd WIN if game ends! \ud83e\udd14\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 Empty on board \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 Empty on board \u2705\n\nSo physically safe moves: DOWN (if he leaves), LEFT, RIGHT. UP is suicide into my own body.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (6,5):**\nHis safe moves from (6,5):\n- UP \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 Currently my head! If he goes UP and I stay, he dies hitting my body? Wait, my head is at (6,6), but my body is at (6,7) and (6,8). So (6,6) is just my head. If he moves into (6,6) and I'm still there, that's head-on collision! DOUBLE KO.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 His own body! \u274c SELF-COLLISION.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 Empty \u2705\n\nSo his safe moves: UP (risky if I stay), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION SCENARIOS THIS TURN:**\n- If I go DOWN to (6,5) and he goes UP to (6,6) \u2192 we swap places, no collision.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,5) and he stays at (6,5) \u2192 I move into where his head WAS? Actually simultaneous move: he would leave (6,5) if he moves, so if he moves LEFT/RIGHT/UP, I'd land on an empty cell. If he stays (which is illegal because DOWN is into his body? Wait, staying isn't a move. He must pick UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. So he won't be at (6,5) after the turn. So DOWN is safe from immediate collision with him.\n- If I stay at (6,6) and he goes UP to (6,6) \u2192 HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! I win because I have more apples! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nHOLD UP! Should I force the head-on? I have 2 apples vs his 1. If we double KO, game ends and I WIN! That's a VICTORY! But is it guaranteed? If I stay (i.e., move UP? Wait, staying isn't a move. I have to pick a direction. If I pick UP, that's into my body \u2014 suicide. If I pick LEFT/RIGHT, I leave (6,6). If I pick DOWN, I leave (6,6). So I CANNOT stay at (6,6). So head-on this turn only happens if he moves UP into (6,6) while I move into (6,6) from somewhere else? That's impossible because I can't move into (6,6) from any safe direction except maybe if I could move UP from (6,5) but I'm at (6,6). So head-on this turn is unlikely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nI want to BOX HIM! He's at (6,5), I'm at (6,6). I'm longer. I can descend and force him against the bottom wall (y=0). If I go DOWN to (6,5) and he goes LEFT/RIGHT, I'm still above him? Actually if I go DOWN to (6,5) and he goes LEFT to (5,5), then I'm at (6,5), he's at (5,5). Next turn I could go LEFT to (5,5) to chase, but he could move again. Better to use my body to cut off space.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6), I'm moving sideways, giving him room to breathe. I want PRESSURE!\n\n**CHECK DOWN (6,5):**\nNext turn from (6,5), my body will be at (6,6),(6,7). He might be at (5,5) or (7,5) or (6,6) if he went UP. If he went UP to (6,6) and I went DOWN to (6,5), we swapped \u2014 no collision. Then next turn I'm at (6,5), he's at (6,6). That's reversed positions. I could then go UP to (6,6) \u2014 but that's where his head is, potential head-on. But again, I have higher score, so if we head-on next turn, I win. But he might not go into me.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE:** DOWN! It keeps direct vertical pressure, limits his space, and sets up possible head-on next turn if he tries to go up into me. Plus, if he goes LEFT/RIGHT, I can follow horizontally next turn.\n\n**LEFT (5,6) or RIGHT (7,6)** are safer but less aggressive. I want to DOMINATE!\n\n**VERDICT:** DOWN! Keep the pressure, use my length, aim to trap him against the wall or force a winning head-on! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** If he goes LEFT/RIGHT, consider moving horizontally to block his escape. If he goes UP, we might swap; then next turn consider going UP to force head-on if I still have apple lead. Maintain aggression!\n\nDOWN",
