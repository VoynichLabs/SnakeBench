This is where my tail is\n\nThe enemy snake moved from (6, 5) to (6, 4), so they're now right next to the apple at (9, 4). They'll likely go for that one next.\n\nStrategy analysis:\nThe apple at (3, 8) is still my best target. From my current position (2, 3), I can reach it by:\n- Going RIGHT to (3, 3), then UP 5 times to (3, 8), or\n- Going UP to (2, 4), then RIGHT to (3, 4), then UP 4 more times\n\nBoth paths are viable, but going RIGHT first might be more efficient since it gets me directly in the same column as the apple. This also keeps me away from the left edge of the board.\n\nThe enemy is likely going RIGHT toward (9, 4), so there's no immediate collision risk.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (3, 3), continue UP toward the apple at (3, 8). Keep monitoring enemy movements and be ready to pivot to other apples if needed.\n\nRIGHT"

My previous move was from (9, 4) \u2192 (9, 5).\n\n---\n\n### **Available Moves**\n\n#### 1. **UP** \u2192 (9, 6)\n- Are we within the board? Yes. (y = 6 is less than 10)\n- Is the space empty? Check enemy and my own body.\n  - My body is [(9,4), (8,4)]\n  - Enemy Snake #0: Head (3,6), Body (3,5)\n  - Therefore, (9,6) is empty.  \n- **SAFE**\n\n#### 2. **RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 5)\n- (10,5) is off the board.  \n- **NOT SAFE**\n\n#### 3. **DOWN** \u2192 (9, 4)\n- (9,4) is part of my own body (immediately behind my head), but my tail will move away from (8,4) to (9,4). \n- However, moving BACKWARD into my body is typically forbidden.  \n- Even if tail moves, after my last move, the body is: [(9,5), (9,4), (8,4)] before moving.\n- So (9,4) is currently occupied by my own body and **NOT SAFE** to double back into.\n\n#### 4. **LEFT** \u2192 (8, 5)\n- (8,5) is not part of my body.\n- It's within board boundaries.\n- Enemy not present.\n- **SAFE**\n\n---\n\n### **Which Is Best?**\n\n#### **Apples:**\n- (0, 7), (3, 8), (5, 8), (4, 7), (6, 0)\n- The most apples are at the upper rows, especially (5,8), (3,8), (4,7), and (0,7).\n- So heading UP, then LEFT, is likely optimal to reach these apples.\n\n#### **Enemy Snakes:**\n- Enemy Snake #0 is at (3,6), body at (3,5); far from me.\n\n#### **Am I at the Wall?**\n- I'm at the far right edge (x=9).\n\n#### **Safe Space Check:**\n- Both UP (9,6) and LEFT (8,5) are safe.\n- UP keeps me hugging the wall and moving toward the cluster of apples in higher rows.\n- LEFT would put me in a less useful line, with no apples nearby on row 5.\n\n#### **Strategic Preference:**\n- Stay close to the board edge to minimize being surrounded.\n- Continue moving UP until I reach y=8, then start moving LEFT toward that apple cluster.\n- Keep difference in growth and body positioning in mind; don't double back into self.\n\n---\n\n## **STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**\n- If (9,7) is open next turn, move UP again.\n- Once you reach top rows (y=8 or y=7), start snake LEFT (decreasing x) toward apples.\n- Keep tracking snake #0's path in case it heads to any of the apples you target.\n\n---\n\n## **DECISION**\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n---\n\n**Next Move:** UP"

However, it may be preferable to maximize board coverage by using the upper row (y=8), as it is more open and keeps maximum options before dropping down.\n\n### 5. **Avoiding Getting Trapped**\n\nIf you go UP, you get one more \"row\" to utilize before you must start weaving left\u2014so it's safer in the long run (more space, less likely to get boxed in upper right).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Conclusion / Plan**\n\n- **Go UP one more time**\n- Next turn: If (9,9) is open, you could use it; but safe play is to start heading LEFT at (9,8), making your way toward apples on (5,8)/(4,7).\n- Monitor enemy snake's direction, especially if they start pushing right toward those apples.\n\n---\n\n### **Decided Move:**\n\n**UP**\n\n---\n\n**Next Turn Strategy Note:**  \nFrom (9,8), consider starting to move LEFT toward the apple cluster on your upper left, unless a threat or new apple appears somewhere else.\n\n**Move:** UP"

So I can safely take the (5, 8) apple.\n\nBetween the two apple options:\n- (5, 8) keeps me on the top row with more maneuvering space\n- (4, 7) puts me closer to the center but in a slightly more constrained position\n\nI'll go for the (5, 8) apple since it maintains better positioning and the enemy snake can't reach it in time.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting this apple, I'll be 4 segments long. I should then consider going for the (0, 7) apple or the remaining (4, 7) apple while keeping distance from the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT"

Snake Status and Position\n- **Current head:** (9,8)\n- **Body:** (9,7), (9,6)\n- **Your last move:** UP from (9,7)\n- **Enemy head:** (4,8)\n- **Enemy body:** (3,8), (3,7)\n\n### 2. Apples\n- (0,7)\n- (6,0)\n- (5,8)\n- (4,7)\n- (7,1)\n\n### 3. Board Analysis\n\n#### a) Possible Moves from (9,8):\n\n**UP:** (9,9)\n- On the board (yes)\n- Nobody occupies (yes)\n- No apple (no)\n- Safe? Yes\n\n**DOWN:** (9,7)\n- Occupied by your own body. Unsafe.\n\n**LEFT:** (8,8)\n- On the board (yes)\n- Empty (yes)\n- No apple (no)\n- Safe? Yes\n\n**RIGHT:** (10,8)\n- Off the board. Unsafe.\n\n#### b) Proximity to Apples\n- The nearest apples on the same y-row or nearby: (5,8) at y=8 (left), (4,7) at y=7 (left and down).\n- Going UP to (9,9) increases your distance from any apples.\n- Going LEFT to (8,8) keeps you at y=8, closer to (5,8), and starts moving you toward the cluster.\n\n#### c) Threats and Space\n- Your tail is trailing behind you in y=7 and y=6.\n- Edge at (9,9) is near; going UP further adds no benefit after that.\n- Enemy snake is at (4,8) \u2014 relatively far unless they move right quickly.\n\n### 4. Move Assessment\n\n#### UP to (9,9):\n- You'd be forced to turn LEFT next turn.\n- You are as far top-right as can be, so if cornered, your only safe direction would be LEFT.\n- Delays progression toward apples.\n\n#### LEFT to (8,8):\n- Preserves flexibility in movement.\n- Head toward apple cluster at (5,8), (4,7).\n- More options if something changes.\n- Safer than getting cornered at top right.\n\n### 5. Recommendation\n\n**Move LEFT to (8,8)**\n\n- Rationale: Progresses you safely toward the apple at (5,8), avoids pressing further into the corner, keeps open space and escape options.\n\n---\n\n## Strategy for Next Turn\n\nIf the way is clear, continue moving LEFT toward (5,8) to collect an apple. Keep an eye on the enemy if they approach from the left. Don't cut off your exit route; consider dropping DOWN at (5,8) toward the (4,7) apple, depending on the enemy's position.\n\n---\n\n**Decided move: LEFT**"

This is where my body segment is\n- UP: Move to (5, 9) - Safe, moves toward the (7, 9) apple\n- DOWN: Move to (5, 7) - Safe, positions me well for multiple apples\n\nAnalysis of each safe option:\n\n1.

Check Safe Moves\n\n- **UP (8,9):** On board, unoccupied.\n- **DOWN (8,7):** Not occupied by me, but if I just came from (9,7) previously, but my body right now is [(9,8), (9,7)] so (8,7) is open.\n- **LEFT (7,8):** Open.\n- **RIGHT (9,8):** My previous head, now part of my body, so not safe.\n\nSo all of UP, DOWN, LEFT are open.\n\nBut let's recheck: I am at (8,8), my body is [(9,8), (9,7)], so (8,7) is open (my body is not at (8,7)), so I can move DOWN if needed. Good.\n\n## 3. Apple Direction\n\nNearest apples:\n- (4,7): left and slightly down.\n- (7,9): left and up.\n- (6,0): down and left, but far.\n- (0,7): far left.\n- (7,1): down left.\n\nI am already heading LEFT, which brings me closer to (4,7) and (5,8).\n\nEnemy snake:\n- Head at (5,8), body at [(4,8), (3,8), (3,7)].\n- If enemy moves toward (4,8), they could reach the apple (4,7) soon.\n\n## 4. Assess Best Move\n\n**UP (8,9):**  \n- Stays on edge; not caught but doesn't progress toward apples.  \n- Next, can go LEFT to (7,9) (apple there).  \n\n**LEFT (7,8):**  \n- Approaches (7,9) (can go UP next turn to apple).  \n- Also closer to (4,7) cluster.  \n- Plenty of space, no threat.  \n- Keeps options open.\n\n**DOWN (8,7):**  \n- Not close to apples; (7,1) is two steps down then five steps left, not attractive.  \n- Not as effective as LEFT/UP to approach apples.\n\n## 5. Consider Opponent\n\n- Enemy is far enough to not be an immediate threat.  \n- The apple at (7,9) is two steps away: if I go LEFT now to (7,8), next I can go UP to (7,9) and possibly get the apple.\n\n## 6. Plan Chain\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,8).  \n- Then assess between UP (grabbing apple at (7,9)) or continue left toward (5,8)/(4,7) as per enemy position.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- **If the apple at (7,9) remains and enemy is not in reach,** go UP to claim it.\n- **If enemy starts chasing (4,7)/(5,8) apples,** switch toward (7,9) or further left as situation changes.\n- **Continue to avoid getting trapped near board edge** and keep my escape paths open.\n\n---\n\n## Decided Move\n\n**LEFT** (to (7,8))\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- Move: **LEFT**\n- Strategy: Go for apple at (7,9) next if it's still there; keep an eye on enemy movement for plans thereafter.\n\n---\n\n**Decided Move: LEFT**"

Safe Moves\n\n**From (7,9), what are my legal, safe options?**\n\n- **UP (7,10):** OFF the board \u2013 NOT allowed.\n- **DOWN (7,8):** This is now part of my body, but since I just grew, let's check if my tail moved: My body is now extended; if I moved UP and ate an apple, my body would be 4 segments: [(7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8)]. My tail (the last part) would stay at (9,8).\n  - Moving DOWN would put my head at (7,8), which is now my own body immediately behind my head.\n  - **So, DOWN is unsafe (I\u2019d hit myself).**\n- **LEFT (6,9):** Is (6,9) occupied? Check body:\n  - My current body: [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8)]\n  - Enemy: at or near (4,7), body on lower y.\n  - (6,9) is open.\n- **RIGHT (8,9):** Is (8,9) occupied?\n  - Look at my body: (8,8) is part of my body, but (8,9) is not.\n  - Enemy snakes not there.\n  - (8,9) is open.\n\n## 3. Apple Proximity\n\n- (0,7): Far left, and a dangerous bottleneck near edge.\n- (6,0): Far bottom left.\n- (7,1): Directly below me, far (need to travel down seven rows).\n- (8,0): Far bottom right.\n\nNo apples nearby.\n\n## 4. Enemy Position\n\n- Enemy head: (4,7), body: [(5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)]. They are towards middle-left, not near me for now.\n\n## 5. Trap Avoidance\n\nI'm at the top, edge of the board at (7,9).\n\nOptions:\n- LEFT (6,9): Puts me closer to more central board.\n- RIGHT (8,9): Puts me toward edge, but not as dangerous yet (since right edge is (9,9)).\n- DOWN is **unsafe** (would hit myself).\n- UP is forbidden.\n\n## 6. Which way is better: LEFT or RIGHT?\n\n### LEFT (6,9):\n\n- (6,9) is open.\n- Brings me closer to central board, possibly toward apple at (7,1).\n- Also brings me closer (by a little) to vertical column with apple at (0,7) if I want to cross to left.\n\n### RIGHT (8,9):\n\n- (8,9) is open.\n- (8,0) apple is in this column, way below.\n- (8,9) is toward top-right edge (I'm almost at the top-right corner if I keep going right).\n\n**But overall, moving LEFT usually is safer because it gives more escape routes and centers you, while moving RIGHT brings me to edge and possible trap.**\n\n## 7. Final Safe Moves & Decision\n\n- DOWN = unsafe, my own body.\n- UP = off board.\n- RIGHT = open, but moves toward edge.\n- LEFT = open, moves toward more central area.\n\n## 8. Future Plan\n\n- After moving LEFT, check if I have an opening downward toward apple at (7,1).\n- Monitor enemy snake and adjust if they threaten any apples.\n\n---\n\n## Final Decision\n\n**Decided Move: LEFT**\n\n### Next-Turn Self-Note:\nAfter moving to (6,9), reevaluate options to move toward apple at (7,1), watch for any new apples, and keep to open spaces while avoiding edges. If enemy approaches any apple near me, plan for cut-off or retreat.\n\n---\n\n**Move: LEFT**"

Updated State After Last Move\n\n- Last move: **LEFT** from (7,9) \u2192 **(6,9)**\n- My body now: head at (6,9), rest: [(7,9), (7,8), (8,8)]\n- My tail: (8,8)\n\n- Enemy #0:\n  - Head: (3,7) (from your info above)\n  - Body: [(4,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8)]\n- Apples: (0,7), (6,0), (7,1), (8,0), (3,3)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Check Surroundings for Safe Moves\n\n### Possible moves from (6,9):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,10): off board (**unsafe**)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,8): is (6,8) clear?\n    - My body: (7,9), (7,8), (8,8)\n    - Enemy: all y \u2264 8 and x \u2264 5\n    - (6,8) is open\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,9)\n    - My body: (7,9), (7,8), (8,8)\n    - (5,9) is open\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,9)\n    - My body: my previous head, now second segment: (7,9)\n    - So, (7,9) is occupied by me\n    - **Unsafe** (can't double back)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Apple Proximity and Pathing\n\n- (0,7): far to the left, y=7.\n- (6,0): same x, y=0 (directly below me, but very far).\n- (7,1): just right of me, near bottom.\n- (8,0): far right, bottom row.\n- (3,3): mid-left, lower portion.\n\nStrategically, going DOWN would incrementally take me toward (6,0).\nGoing LEFT would shift me more central, and next to column for (0,7), while preserving much escape space.\nNeither DOWN nor LEFT gives me an immediate apple.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Enemy Proximity\n\n- Closest enemy at (3,7)\u2014lower left area, not nearby\n- No enemy parts to immediate left or below\n\n---\n\n## 5. Trap Potential\n\n- (6,9) is still top edge, but one step more central than before.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,8):\n  - Still fairly open, but going down too soon limits the chance to escape if the body starts to close in from below.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,9):\n  - Centers me, keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Move Evaluation\n\nLet\u2019s examine moves:\n\n**UP:** Illegal (off board)\n\n**RIGHT:** Illegal (my own body at (7,9))\n\n**DOWN: (6,8):**\n- Open and safe\n- Gradual approach toward apple at (6,0)\n- Potentially safe, but possibly approaching own tail if not careful; but my tail will move too.\n\n**LEFT: (5,9):**\n- Open and safe\n- Staying on top row, but now more central\n- Opens more side-escape routes (5,8,6,8,4,9)\n- Closer to (0,7) (apple) by x-coordinate, but need to drop down two rows for y=7.\n\n**LEFT** is a safer, more flexible move because it keeps my options open and avoids pushing me into bottom half too soon.\n\nBut **DOWN** is still open\u2014if I want to start moving for (6,0) apple. But it's a long way down and exposes me to getting boxed in against my own tail if I zigzag.\n\n---\n\n### My Current Preference\n\n- I currently favor **LEFT (5,9)** because it keeps me near the center row and keeps both DOWN and LEFT open for subsequent moves, while moving DOWN starts to restrict my exit routes.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Next-Turn Self-Note\n\n- If I move LEFT, check if continuing LEFT or DOWN makes sense based on enemy and apples.\n- Reassess if it\u2019s time to start dropping lower for (6,0) apple or to contest apples on left with enemy.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Decision - Move: LEFT**\n\n**Move:** LEFT\n\n---\n\n**Next-turn strategy:**  \nContinue evaluating centrality for flexibility vs. direct approaches to apples, give extra weight to staying away from early dead ends/top/bottom rows unless I see a fast, clear apple route.\n\n**My move:** LEFT"

My own body: (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (8,8) \u2014 not at (5,8).\n    - Enemy: enemy's body parts are (4,7), (5,7), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) \u27f6 **ENEMY occupies (5,8)** (**unsafe**)\n- **LEFT**: (4,9)\n    - Clear?

          "rationale": "Let's think step by step from the current board state.\n\n### 1. My Current State\n- My head: **(4,9)** (just moved there by going LEFT)\n- My body: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9)]\n- My length is 4\n- Apples: (0,7), (6,0), (7,1), (8,0), (3,3)\n- Enemy's head: (1,7), body: [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8)]\n\n### 2. Evaluate Possible Moves from (4,9)\n\n#### UP: (4,10)\n- Off the board (**illegal**)\n\n#### DOWN: (4,8)\n- Is it free?\n- Check my own body: [(5,9), (6,9), (7,9)]: **not at (4,8)**\n- Check enemy body: [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8)] (**not at (4,8)**)\n- So, **(4,8) is free**\n\n#### LEFT: (3,9)\n- Check my own body: **not occupied**\n- Check enemy body: **not occupied**\n- So, **(3,9) is free**\n\n#### RIGHT: (5,9)\n- My body occupies (5,9): **illegal** (can't reverse into yourself)\n\n### 3. Safe Moves\n- Only options: **DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9)**\n\n### 4. Strategic Considerations\n\n- Apples: Closest apple toward the bottom left is (3,3). To get there, moving LEFT (to (3,9)) then continue dropping down is one option.\n- Danger from enemy: Enemy snake\u2019s body is largely in row 7, columns 2-5. However, moving DOWN to (4,8) keeps me above that cluster but could drop me near the middle (which the enemy is closer to control).\n- Moving LEFT to (3,9) further positions me closer to the leftmost apple at (0,7), and less risk of immediate head-on collision.\n- Both (3,9) and (4,8) are relatively safe short-term, but (3,9) keeps me along the top edge and away from the enemy and buys time.\n\n### 5. Plan\n- Move LEFT to (3,9)\n    - Avoids immediate danger\n    - Keeps options open to go down next turn\n    - Allows more control of the top left quadrant\n    - Positions to drop toward apples at (3,3) or (0,7) when safer\n\n### 6. Next Turn Strategy:\n- From (3,9), reevaluate dropping DOWN if enemy is still far, or continue left to (2,9) if enemy approaches the center faster.\n- Remain alert for trap formation; keep options open.\n- Avoid getting caught on the edge (plan an exit route downward in 1-2 turns).\n\n---\n\n## DECIDED MOVE\n\n**LEFT**\n\n---\n\n### Next Turn Self-Reminder\nIf enemy is advancing up center columns, drop down soon to secure (3,3) or (0,7). Do not get trapped at the edge. Prioritize safety, then apple collection.\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**LEFT**"

I'm 7 segments long.\n\nEnemy snake (ID: 1) is at position (3, 8) with body at [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9)]. They're 4 segments long.\n\nCurrent apples: (6, 0), (7, 1), (8, 0), (3, 3), (9, 0)\n\nI'm currently at (0, 6) on the left wall. Let me check my movement options:\n- LEFT: DEATH! This would take me to (-1, 6) which is outside the board.\n- RIGHT to (1, 6): Safe! This gets me off the left wall into open space.\n- UP to (0, 7): DEATH! This is where my body segment is.\n- DOWN to (0, 5): Safe, but keeps me on the left wall.\n\nRIGHT is clearly the best move here because:\n1. It gets me off the dangerous left wall\n2. It moves me into open territory \n3. It positions me better to navigate toward the apples\n4. It gives me more options for future moves\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 6), I'll be in a much better position. From there, I can start working toward the (3, 3) apple, which is the closest and most accessible apple. The bottom row apples are further away and closer to each other, which might create competition with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT, assess whether to continue RIGHT toward the center, or move UP/DOWN to start positioning for the (3, 3) apple. Need to be mindful of the enemy snake's movements and avoid getting trapped again.\n\nRIGHT"
