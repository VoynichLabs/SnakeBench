Moving RIGHT toward it could lead to early confrontation.\n\nMoving UP from (6, 1) to (6, 2) maintains flexibility - I can then move LEFT to chase the apple cluster, or explore other options. This seems like the best positioning move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFocus on harvesting the apple cluster in the (2-3, 3-5) region. Build a safe path leftward and upward to collect multiple apples before the enemy does. Avoid the right side where the enemy is currently positioned.\n\nUP",

It continues my northward progression toward (0, 5) and (0, 6)\n2. From (1, 2), I can move LEFT on the next turn to (0, 2), then continue UP to reach (0, 5)\n3. This keeps me in the middle of the board a bit longer, maintaining flexibility\n4. UP maintains more movement options than getting pinned to the left edge immediately\n5.

Once at approximately (1, 4) or (1, 5), move LEFT to (0, 4)/(0, 5) to collect the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6). This should give me 2 more apples for a total of 9. After that, assess the board and target (2, 9) if the path is clear, or continue managing the game state based on enemy snake movements.\n\nUP",

This continues my successful left-edge strategy.\n  \n- **RIGHT to (1, 8):** Breaks away from the left edge and moves toward the interior. The apple at (2, 9) would then require moving diagonally, which is less efficient.\n\nThe apple at (2, 9) is clearly the nearest target and can be collected in the next turn with UP followed by RIGHT→RIGHT. Enemy #0 remains far away at (8, 2), posing no immediate threat.\n\n**Next turn plan:**\nMove to (0, 9), then RIGHT to (1, 9) and (2, 9) to collect the apple at (2, 9). After collecting this apple, reassess the remaining apples at (7, 7), (6, 8), (9, 2), and (0, 0).

Less strategic.\n\nLooking at my long-term options:\n- The apple at (9, 2) is very accessible if I go RIGHT then DOWN\n- The apple at (5, 4) requires going LEFT then DOWN\n- Both (3, 6) and (5, 4) are viable paths\n\nGiven my position at (7, 7), moving DOWN to (7, 6) is a good strategic move because:\n1. It keeps me flexible - I can then move RIGHT to approach (9, 2) or (9, 0)\n2. It maintains distance from my body\n3.

This move positions my head at (8, 0), which is on the same row as the enemy head (5, 0) but with distance between us. From (8, 0), I can move UP toward (8, 4) or continue toward (6, 2).\n\n**Long-term strategy for next turns:**\nAfter moving to (8, 0), I should prioritize collecting the nearby apples at (8, 4) and (6, 2) as I work my way through the board. The enemy is still minimal threat with only 2 segments. With a 15-1 apple lead, I need to continue steady collection while avoiding head-on collisions. My body is currently running vertically and horizontally along the right edge and top; I have good maneuverability. Target sequence: (8, 4) → (6, 2) → (5, 4) → (3, 6) → (0, 0).\n\nLEFT",
