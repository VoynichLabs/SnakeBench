            "rationale": "**START YOUR STRATEGY**\nWhat I will do is make a plan of the best strategies to choose. First, prioritize the apples to get on them to grow. However, do not make a wrong choice to go against an enemy snake. Since I start off as a very small snake, I feel I can reach most of the apples and make up my body by saving on the fly. Therefore, in case of an enemy snake, I will choose to retract quickly to the mode to avoid being consumed.\n\nThe second priority on using the apples is to have the smartest of them stored for possible strategies based on certain situtations like emergencies. For example, having a head down and two tails on the right can be a very hard situation, so relying on the strategies developed from the known apples and some place information can further help.\n**END YOUR STRATEGY**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nFINAL RATIONALE:\nLast time I called this game the snake #4 died while hitting a wall very hard then became big in the future. In this game, I noticed that there will be a similar group of Snake 4 apples similar to the last map. To solve this properly to avoid death I came up with a term around minus 5 to add to the correct size I needed to become big. As a result, in the last move by snake 4, I added instances 5 all the way to the end of this last move, then after adding the instance 5 in the heading plus the tails head in the same move, I moved upright on the next move by Snake 4. However in this case, I had to ensure to retract my tail correctly upon the combination of instances 1 2 3 4, since there were already take instances 5.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nIt is my turn to move. I have already optimized my previous moves for changes in the board layout, and I have prepared for the behind my heads with the larger apples. As a result of my previous orientation, I cannot turn too far to the right since I have prioritized the head 8 from head 3 to avoid being close too much to starve when too close.\nMy strategy to shield and nail the instance 4 close to starving will be to take the instance 5 which by adding to head 3 also becomes instance 4, since instance 4 starves the same in the next turn by Snake 5 and 6.\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n\n**Start of Your Strategy:**\nTo successfully start the game I first prioritize the apples traversable on the left, since there are all bunched together along the left of the edges of the board.

However, do not make a wrong choice to go against an enemy snake. Since I start off as a very small snake, I feel I can reach most of the apples and make up my body by saving on the fly. Therefore, in case of an enemy snake, I will choose to retract quickly to the mode to avoid being consumed.\n\nThe second priority on using the apples is to have the smartest of them stored for possible strategies based on certain situtations like emergencies. For example, having a head down and two tails on the right can be a very hard situation, so relying on the strategies developed from the known apples and some place information can further help.\n**END YOUR STRATEGY**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nFINAL RATIONALE:\nLast time I called this game the snake #4 died while hitting a wall very hard then became big in the future. In this game, I noticed that there will be a similar group of Snake 4 apples similar to the last map. To solve this properly to avoid death I came up with a term around minus 5 to add to the correct size I needed to become big. As a result, in the last move by snake 4, I added instances 5 all the way to the end of this last move, then after adding the instance 5 in the heading plus the tails head in the same move, I moved upright on the next move by Snake 4.

As a result of my previous orientation, I cannot turn too far to the right since I have prioritized the head 8 from head 3 to avoid being close too much to starve when too close.\nMy strategy to shield and nail the instance 4 close to starving will be to take the instance 5 which by adding to head 3 also becomes instance 4, since instance 4 starves the same in the next turn by Snake 5 and 6.\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n\n**Start of Your Strategy:**\nTo successfully start the game I first prioritize the apples traversable on the left, since there are all bunched together along the left of the edges of the board.

However I have kept scheduling also to take in where your snakes are already and killing them with their backs to the wall. But this particular action should ensure that my next movement is used to pop a preference.\n\nMy strategy starts off by prioritising my approach towards a take place 8, which incidentally is very close to a take place 2, now my take place 5. Therefore, I create a schedule to prioritize the take places very close to the board edge along each side. This is majorly to distribute the apples along the sides of the board such that they are easier to get to, otherwise I'll have to heave the apple towards the middle of the board, which will be great tactic later in time.\nBut first however, I also prioritize the horizontal lines to get the apples in quicker using my strategy to start off with. This will also help to place all me apples much more closer to the starting size if I start off big.\nI prioritize the board edges in this case, as that means the apples will be easier to reach also. Therefore, the easier path to an Apple is exacting itself more since it is a simple approach with no judgment. Still we prioritize where the down apple is on the left hand side. Promptly before that, we will all carefully track the direction. One apple left can mean a huge deal in the road, as well as meaning that one take place 8 is much much easier to obtain.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START Your Strategy**\nYour strategy is to first make sure you prioritize gathering all the apples using your dual path strategy to make your snake longer and also be ready for a surprise. For the horizontal side of the apples, use mid-moves to get them.\nAlways prioritize the board edges since to get the apples close to you helps. Prioritize able to take the board edge list of apples first since lastly it relates to a priority to be close to the apples at the edges of the board. I will describe the idea a little further below using the numbers regarding the apples. So, as I said before: The abilities connected to gathering apples will involve both decisions (due to my decision to prioritize for these apples) which would be a strategy as well. \n\n[2/3/4/5] will be prioritized by decision since this part does not have much to do with judging where the snakes are. As you can see, the one apples with an 8 is very close to each snake respectively so we factor it. This one apples is also preferential for the down right. Prioritizing apples horizontally is done via 'mid movement' with my re-scheduling and I'm sure of the one time I'm an up. \n\n[6] will get priority too since it's the apples at the edge going towards each enemy snakes eaten apples. This happens very subtly by just minding the placements with the snakes that are trying to intersect. One apples at 6 should coincidently be the one that's an inch away from 2. My plan will be to sacrifice this one and take it off to allow up-mover 2 to get it first, giving me a nearby job more intently towards the snake of head 8. But we'll make sure that we exhaust our priorities and one apples 6 is prioritized when The snake of 8,3&5 will eventually take it whether it's too close or not to allow for a long way to come back. On the other side of my snake 8, I will try to carefully do my plan. I will say favored [6] apples for your snake 5.\n\n**END YOUR STRATEGY**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nTowards the very end, I will allow Play Snake 8 to complete its turn, right after I complete mine. Once complete, I will decide whatever movement I will do next. In the generate solution, you can choose the best overall performance, stability, rating, cumulative cumulative rating, number of original-placement apples, or number of counter-clockwise directions.\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n```",

However, do not make a wrong choice to go against an enemy snake. Since I start off as a very small snake, I feel I can reach most of the apples and make up my body by saving on the fly. Therefore, in case of an enemy snake, I will choose to retract quickly to the mode to avoid being consumed.\n\nThe second priority on using the apples is to have the smartest of them stored for possible strategies based on certain situtations like emergencies. For example, having a head down and two tails on the right can be a very hard situation, so relying on the strategies developed from the known apples and some place information can further help.\n**END YOUR STRATEGY**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nFINAL RATIONALE:\nLast time I called this game the snake #4 died while hitting a wall very hard then became big in the future. In this game, I noticed that there will be a similar group of Snake 4 apples similar to the last map. To solve this properly to avoid death I came up with a term around minus 5 to add to the correct size I needed to become big. As a result, in the last move by snake 4, I added instances 5 all the way to the end of this last move, then after adding the instance 5 in the heading plus the tails head in the same move, I moved upright on the next move by Snake 4. However in this case, I had to ensure to retract my tail correctly upon the combination of instances 1 2 3 4, since there were already take instances 5.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nIt is my turn to move. I have already optimized my previous moves for changes in the board layout, and I have prepared for the behind my heads with the larger apples. As a result of my previous orientation, I cannot turn too far to the right since I have prioritized the head 8 from head 3 to avoid being close too much to starve when too close.\nMy strategy to shield and nail the instance 4 close to starving will be to take the instance 5 which by adding to head 3 also becomes instance 4, since instance 4 starves the same in the next turn by Snake 5 and 6.\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n\n**Start of Your Strategy:**\nTo successfully start the game I first prioritize the apples traversable on the left, since there are all bunched together along the left of the edges of the board. Then on the right I prioritize the head 8 since I will be too close to starving if I am too far to the right and will also minimize my speed in this board range.\nThe next snake that I prioritize will be at the end of the 1st instance . At this instance, I will have the instance 2 and 3 sides. My goal is to add the instance 2 and instance 3 on the board and then add the take place instance 4. Hence, I have prioritized the having instance 2 and 3 on the head by the ends of these instances to minimize my losses.\n\n--Last move information: up BEFORE THIS Move: LEFT\n--Last move information: down after THIS Move: MID-MOVE\n\nMy strategy keeps going right after instance 4 is added. I prioritize maintaining the speed of each snake early on in order to avoid snakey type situations later on in the game. As a result, I cannot hardly avoid getting eaten by the Snake 6 as both heads are very close giving me a very small center left position.\n\n--Last move information: right BEFORE THIS Move: RIGHT\n--Last move information: left after THIS Move: MID-MOVE\n**END Start Your Strategy:**\n\nYOUR STRATEGEY: \n\n--Last move information: up BEFORE THIS Move: LEFT\n--Last move information: down ATER THIS Move: MID-MOVE\n\nYOUR RATIONALE:\nYOUR MOTIVE:\nThe objectives of my strategy is to check for a checkpoint in the snake map that will help maximize the size when choosing a place early on. My motivation is the apple 3,8 and 3,3 when choosing a direction.\n\nYOUR LAST RATIONALE:\nAfter reaching Head 8, I can never turn to the right as too close to cut off from apples 2, 4, and 5. After this space, I chose turn to the right since this avoids cutting off apples 8 and beyond. However, I realized that it is better for the turn to the left, starting the snake movement in this area ensures that it could reach two apples down 3 with the apple 3,3 head.\n\n\n--Last move information: right BEFORE THIS Move: RIGHT\n--Last move information: left after THIS Move: MID-MOVE\n\n**START YOUR RATIONALE**\nI decided my next move will be LEFT since this spreads me further left (3.5) from all the apples because of the boundary with the snake 3 apple to the right. Then I will also enable the Head 3 not getting too close on the next turn in case Snake 3 went left.\n\n**END YOUR RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYOUR LAST RATIONALE:\nMy Last Rationale told me head 8 cannot move right, apples 2,4,5 are too close. However, by making head 3 move left I can also immediately reposition the 8, nearing the apples so that I elaborate on how I must prioritize the heads right after creating a head count for each color at the marching position nearest the PreSnake 3 estimated 3, 8. Therefore, my rationale is to make Head 3 move to the left, then on the next turn of Head 8, make it move up, head 3 in the middle, to take the take place 3, letting head 3 exploitatre and eventually connect to the take place to increase size right at the last head 8 when we reunite. Then head 8 makes right to allow the take place 3 after we completed the positioning of head 3. How fast did I managed to eat the apples 3 and 8 by sacrificing head 8 that is far left away after preparing a close head 3 and then assuring that the Head 8 aproaches, which coincidentally proved that I was right in preferring the positioning of Head 8 left far to increase size, afteter carefully accounted for the instict in position Engagement 3 and rationing the left locks to starve it. \n\n--Last move information: LEFT BEFORE THIS Move: RIGHT\n--Last move information: RIGHT after THIS Move: MID-MOVE\n**END\u00a0LAST RATIONALE**\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a 10x10 multi-apple game.
