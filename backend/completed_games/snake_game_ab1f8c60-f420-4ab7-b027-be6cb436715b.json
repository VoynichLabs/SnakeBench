Safety Check for My Move (Head at (0, 0))**\n\nThe board boundaries are $0 \\le x \\le 9$ and $0 \\le y \\le 9$.\nMy current body is just the head (0, 0). There is no previous position, so moving backward (which would be moving into an empty space or off the board if the snake were longer) is not a concern unless it leads off-board, which it doesn't from (0,0).\n\n*   **UP (0, 1):** Safe from boundaries. Safe from my body (no body).\n*   **DOWN (0, -1):** Dies (Off board).\n*   **LEFT (-1, 0):** Dies (Off board).\n*   **RIGHT (1, 0):** Safe from boundaries. Safe from my body.\n\nPossible safe moves for me: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Head Position Check**\n\nEnemy Snake #1 Head is at (2, 6).\n\n*   If I move UP to (0, 1): Enemy is at (2, 6). No collision.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (1, 0): Enemy is at (2, 6). No collision.\n\n**3. Enemy Movement Analysis**\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (Head at (2, 6), Length 1) will also move. I need to anticipate where they might move and see if they threaten to eat me or block my path. Since they are very far from me, I will primarily focus on reaching the nearest apple.\n\n**4. Apple Proximity and Targeting**\n\nMy head is at (0, 0).\nApples:\nA1: (1, 4) - Distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$\nA2: (6, 0) - Distance $\\sqrt{6^2 + 0^2} = 6$\nA3: (6, 9) - Distance $\\sqrt{6^2 + 9^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 81} = \\sqrt{117} \\approx 10.8$\nA4: (7, 7) - Distance $\\sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \\sqrt{98} \\approx 9.9$\nA5: (9, 2) - Distance $\\sqrt{9^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 4} = \\sqrt{85} \\approx 9.2$\n\nThe closest apple is A1 at (1, 4).\n\n**5. Evaluating Safe Moves towards (1, 4)**\n\n*   **UP to (0, 1):** Moves closer in Y, but farther in X. Distance to (1, 4) is now $\\sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{10}$. (Change in distance: $\\sqrt{17} - \\sqrt{10} \\approx 4.12 - 3.16 = 0.96$ improvement).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 0):** Moves closer in X, same in Y. Distance to (1, 4) is now $\\sqrt{0^2 + 4^2} = 4$. (Change in distance: $\\sqrt{17} - 4 \\approx 4.12 - 4 = 0.12$ improvement).\n\nMoving UP provides a better net distance reduction towards the closest apple (1, 4). It also keeps me away from the bottom edge, allowing more maneuverability later, compared to moving RIGHT which hugs the bottom edge (y=0).\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nI will pursue the nearest apple at (1, 4). The move UP gets me closer to the target coordinates (1, 4) than RIGHT does in terms of distance reduction this turn. I will prioritize moving towards that apple.\n\nSince both UP and RIGHT are safe, UP is strategically better for minimizing distance to the closest target.\n\nMove: UP\n\nUP is to (0, 1). Distance to (1, 4) decreases from $\\sqrt{17}$ to $\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nUP",

Enemy Movement Analysis**\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1, 6). They will also move. I must assume they move optimally towards an apple or towards me if I am attractive prey. They are looking for apples at (1, 4), (6, 0), (6, 9), (7, 7), (9, 2). (1, 4) is the closest target for me, and reasonably close for them too (distance $\\approx 2.8$ to (1, 4)).\n\n**4. Apple Proximity and Targeting (Target: (1, 4))**\nCurrent position: (0, 1). Target: (1, 4).\n\n*   **UP to (0, 2):** Distance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. (Improvement: $\\sqrt{10} - \\sqrt{5} \\approx 3.16 - 2.23 = 0.93$).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Distance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$. (Improvement: $\\sqrt{10} - 3 \\approx 3.16 - 3 = 0.16$).\n\nMoving UP provides significantly better progress towards the nearest apple (1, 4) and keeps the snake centered, away from edges.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nContinue prioritizing movement towards (1, 4). Since moving DOWN is fatal, I must move UP or RIGHT. UP offers the greatest distance reduction towards the target apple. Next turn I will likely need to move RIGHT to start closing the X gap, assuming I don't eat the apple by moving UP twice.\n\nMove: UP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Enemy Movement Analysis**\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (2, 6). They are likely moving towards (1, 4) or (6, 9) or (7, 7). (1, 4) is the closest for us, but (2, 6) is closer to (1, 4) than we are (distance 2.23 for me, distance $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$ for them too). Wait, enemy is at (2, 6). Distance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (6-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. My distance is also $\\sqrt{5}$ if I move RIGHT to (1, 2) next turn, from (0, 2).\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 3), distance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 2), distance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 2^2} = 2$.\n\nMoving UP seems better for closing the gap toward (1, 4) this turn as well (distance reduced from $\\sqrt{5}$ to $\\sqrt{2}$).\n\n**4. Future Safety & Options**\nIf I move UP to (0, 3): Body becomes (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1). Next move options are (0, 4) (UP) or (1, 3) (RIGHT). Down (0, 2) is safe because my tail is at (0, 1).\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 2): Body becomes (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1). Next move options are (1, 3) (UP) or (2, 2) (RIGHT). Down (0, 2) is safe because my tail is at (0, 1).\n\nBoth paths look relatively open. Since UP provides better approach to the nearest apple (1, 4) (distance reduction from $2.23$ to $1.41$), I will choose UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Aim directly for apple (1, 4). Next turn try to minimize distance further. Be cautious about the enemy snake heading southwest.\n\nMove: UP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

(This is the position immediately behind the head).\n*   **LEFT (-1, 3):** Dies (Off board). **FATAL**.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 3):** Safe from boundaries. Safe from my body.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Head Position Check**\nEnemy Head at (2, 7).\n\n*   If I move UP to (0, 4): No collision with enemy head.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (1, 3): No collision with enemy head.\n\n**3. Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake #1 at (2, 7), body at (2, 6))**\nThe enemy might be aiming generally towards the upper right or the middle apples ((7, 7), (6, 9)). They moved UP last turn. Continuing UP to (2, 8) is possible. Moving LEFT $(1, 7)$ or RIGHT $(3, 7)$ or DOWN $(2, 6)$ are also possibilities.\nThe cell (2, 6) is occupied by the enemy body, so I cannot move there next turn if they move UP.\n\n**4. Future Targeting & Safety**\nTarget (1, 4).\n\nIf I move **UP to (0, 4)**:\nDistance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1$. Excellent position for next move.\nNext moves from (0, 4): (1, 4) RIGHT (Eating the apple!), (0, 5) UP. (0, 3) DOWN is safe now (tail is at (0, 2)). If they manage to move to (1, 4) that would be bad, but they are far away at (2, 7).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (1, 3)**:\nDistance to (1, 4) is $\\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1$. Also excellent position for next move.\nNext moves from (1, 3): (1, 4) UP (Eating the apple!), (2, 3) RIGHT. (0, 3) LEFT is safe now (tail is at (0, 2)).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to an immediate win condition (eating the apple at (1, 4) next turn) unless the enemy somehow gets to (1, 4) this turn (which they cannot, they are at (2, 7)).\n\nComparing UP (0, 4) vs RIGHT (1, 3):\n(0, 4) is slightly more central and keeps me slightly further away from the enemy, who is currently high up on the right side of the board. However, this is very early, and proximity to the apple matters most. Both moves guarantee position (1, 4) next turn by moving either UP or LEFT respectively.\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 4), next turn I move RIGHT to (1, 4) and eat A1.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 3), next turn I move UP to (1, 4) and eat A1.\n\nI prefer the move that keeps me more aligned vertically, as the board is very open. Moving UP to (0, 4) keeps my X coordinate at 0. I will select UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Focus solely on reaching apple (1, 4) in the next turn. After eating it, re-evaluate targets, likely aiming for (7, 7) or (6, 9). Ensure continued safety from the single opponent snake #1 moving north.\n\nMove: UP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

If they move in any other direction, they remain alive and pose no immediate threat to my path to (1, 4).\n\n**4. Choosing Move**\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the unambiguous best move as it secures the highest priority apple immediately and increases my length, improving overall safety margin against the single enemy.\n\nIf I move RIGHT: I eat (1, 4).

No collision with (1, 3). **SAFE**.\n\nC. If I move **RIGHT (2, 4)**:\n*   Enemy could move to (1, 5), (1, 7), (0, 6), or (2, 6). No collision with (2, 4). **SAFE**.\n\n**5.

My movement towards it involves moving Right and Down.\n\n*   Move **DOWN (1, 3)**: Progresses towards (4, 3) in the X direction over time, but moves further away in Y immediately. Distance to target changes from $\\sqrt{10}$ to $\\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (3-3)^2} = 3$. This is better than moving UP.\n*   Move **RIGHT (2, 4)**: Progresses towards (4, 3). Distance to target changes from $\\sqrt{10}$ to $\\sqrt{(4-2)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. This is the best move for closing distance to the nearest target (4, 3).\n\nSince both DOWN and RIGHT are safe from immediate collision, I prioritize the move that closes the distance to the nearest apple faster, which is **RIGHT (2, 4)** ($\\sqrt{5}$ vs 3).\n\n**6.

None of these hit (2, 4).\nThis move is safe and advances me towards the next closest apple (4, 3).\n\nLong-term plan: If I reach (2, 4), next turn I aim for (3, 4) or (2, 3) to continue the approach towards (4, 3). I need to keep an eye on the enemy at (1, 6), but they are currently not aggressively threatening my path to the central apples.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Safety Check for My Move (Head at (2, 4))**\nPossible moves from (2, 4):\n\n*   **UP (2, 5):** Safe. Not body (1, 4). Not enemy head (0, 6).\n*   **DOWN (2, 3):** Safe. Not body (1, 4). Not enemy head (0, 6).\n*   **LEFT (1, 4):** Collision with my own body segment (1, 4). **FATAL**.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe. Not body (1, 4). Not enemy head (0, 6).\n\nSafe moves (ignoring enemy movement for now): UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake #1 at (0, 6))**\nEnemy head location: (0, 6). They have no body segments.\n\nEnemy Safe Moves:\n*   UP (0, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN (0, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (Off board - Fatal).\n*   RIGHT (1, 6): Safe.\n\n**4. Collision Prediction (Simultaneous Move)**\nWe check my safe moves against the enemy's safe moves:\n\nA. If I move **UP (2, 5)**:\n*   Enemy potential next positions: (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6). None collide with (2, 5). **SAFE**.\n\nB. If I move **DOWN (2, 3)**:\n*   Enemy potential next positions: (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6). None collide with (2, 3). **SAFE**.\n\nC. If I move **RIGHT (3, 4)**:\n*   Enemy potential next positions: (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6). None collide with (3, 4). **SAFE**.\n\nAll three directions are safe from immediate collision.\n\n**5. Target Selection**\nApples remaining: (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (4, 3).\nMy Head: (2, 4). Target: (4, 3).\n\nDistances (Manhattan/Euclidean approximation):\n*   To (4, 3) via UP (2, 5): Move towards (4, 3). New distance to (4, 3) is $\\sqrt{(4-2)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{4+4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$.\n*   To (4, 3) via DOWN (2, 3): Move towards (4, 3). New distance to (4, 3) is $\\sqrt{(4-2)^2 + (3-3)^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. (Direct Y approach).\n*   To (4, 3) via RIGHT (3, 4): Move towards (4, 3). New distance to (4, 3) is $\\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$. (Best progress).\n\nThe move RIGHT (3, 4) maintains the best progress towards the closest apple (4, 3).\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan**\nContinue moving towards (4, 3) using RIGHT and DOWN moves primarily. The enemy snake is currently far in the top-left corner and poses no immediate threat to my current path or my body. Keep priority on apple acquisition.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--Your last move information:--\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**1. Current State Analysis**\nMy Head: (3, 4). Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4)]. Length 3. Apples: 1.\nSnake #1 Head: (1, 6). Body: none. Length 1. (Snake #1 moved RIGHT to (1, 6) in the last turn based on my analysis, though the board state shows (0, 6) from the input description. RE-EVALUATING ENEMY POSITION FROM BOARD STATE.)\n\n*Correction:* Board state shows Enemy Head at (0, 6) based on the map provided at the START of this turn. The last rationale was based on the prediction that Snake #1 would move to (1, 6) or stay at (0, 6). Let's re-verify the enemy board position from the start of *this* turn (Turn 7): Enemy Head is at (0, 6).\n\nIf Snake #1 was at (0, 6) last turn:\n*   Safe moves were (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6).\n*   If they chose (1, 6) (as predicted in step 3 of Turn 6 Rationale), they are now at (1, 6).\n*   If they chose (0, 7) or (0, 5), they are still on the edge.\n\n*Crucial Check:* I must rely on the board diagram provided for the start of Turn 7.\nBoard State at Turn 7 Start:\nYour Head: (2, 4), Body: [(1, 4)]. (This implies my move RIGHT to (2, 4) happened successfully).\nEnemy Snake #1 - Head: (0, 6), Body: none. (This implies Snake #1 did NOT move, or moved into a position that brought it back to (0, 6), or the input board state is based on the end of Turn 6 *before* the opponent moved, which is highly unlikely in a simultaneous game description format).\n\n**Assumption based on standard simultaneous game reporting:** The board state shown at the top reflects the state *after* all moves from Turn 6 were resolved.\nIf My Head is (2, 4) and Snake #1 Head is (0, 6), then:\nMy previous move (Turn 6) was RIGHT, moving from (1, 4) to (2, 4). (Matches my last rationale).\nSnake #1's previous move (Turn 6) must have resulted in them ending at (0, 6). They were previously at (1, 6) on the Turn 6 board diagram start, which implies they moved LEFT to (0, 6).\n\nApples remaining: (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (4, 3).\nMy Head is (2, 4). (My body is [(1, 4)] from the board state diagram provided for Turn 7 start).\n\n*Conflict Resolution:* The board diagram provided at the start of Turn 7 shows:\nMy Head: (2, 4). Body: [(1, 4)]. Apples: 1. (Length 2)\nEnemy #1 Head: (0, 6). Body: none. Apples: 0. (Length 1)\n\nThis implies that *my* prior move (Turn 6) was RIGHT, resulting in (2, 4), and the snake grew, but the board state only shows the head and one body segment (2, 4) -> (1, 4). If I ate an apple, the body should be longer.\n\nRevisiting Turn 6 status:\nTurn 6 Start: Head (0, 4), Body [( - , - )] (Assuming length 1 before eating). If I ate the apple at (1, 4), my new head is (1, 4), and the body should contain the old head (0, 4). Length 2, Score 1.\nThe Turn 6 rationale stated: \"My Head: (1, 4). Body: [(0, 4)]. Length 2.\"\n\nIf my Last Move (Turn 6) was RIGHT, and my Head is now (2, 4) (from Turn 7 start state):\nThe prior state must have been Head (1, 4), Body [(0, 4)].\nMove RIGHT -> New Head (2, 4). New Body [(1, 4), (0, 4)]. Length 3. Score 1 (if I didn't eat).\n\nThe provided Turn 7 Board State states:\nYour snake: Head (2, 4), Body [(1, 4)]. Apples collected: 1. Length 2.\nThis means I **did not eat an apple** on Turn 6, OR the apple at (1, 4) was never there, OR the board state summary is slightly out of sync regarding growth.\n\nLet's trust the current physical board representation for Turn 7:\nMy Head: (2, 4). My Body: [(1, 4)]. (Length 2).\nEnemy Head: (0, 6).\n\n**2. Safety Check for My Move (Head at (2, 4))**\nPrevious safe directions were UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3), RIGHT (3, 4).\n(LEFT (1, 4) is fatal as it is my own body).\n\n**3. Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake #1 at (0, 6))**\nEnemy safe moves (based on board state): (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6). (LEFT is off board).\n\n**4. Collision Prediction (Simultaneous Move)**\nMy safe moves vs Enemy possibility set { (0, 7), (0, 5), (1, 6) }:\n\nA. If I move **UP (2, 5)**: Safe from collision.\nB. If I move **DOWN (2, 3)**: Safe from collision.\nC. If I move **RIGHT (3, 4)**: Safe from collision.\n\n**5. Target Selection**\nApples remaining: (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (4, 3).\nMy Head: (2, 4). Closest target remains (4, 3).\n\nDistances from (2, 4):\n*   To (4, 3) via UP (2, 5): Distance $\\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$.\n*   To (4, 3) via DOWN (2, 3): Distance $2$.\n*   To (4, 3) via RIGHT (3, 4): Distance $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$. (Best progress).\n\n**6. Strategy**\nSince RIGHT is safe and makes the best progress towards the nearest apple (4, 3), I should choose RIGHT again. The enemy is constrained to the far left edge and is not currently intercepting my path.\n\nLong-term plan remains: Move towards (4, 3). If I reach (4, 3), I will gain length and re-evaluate.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe previous move analysis was for predicting the move *to* (2, 1). Now we are *at* (2, 1).\n\n**Strategy Note:** We just ate an apple and our length is 6. We are relatively safe from the only opponent who is far away at (1, 6).\nRemaining apples: (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (2, 5).\n\nOur current location (2, 1) is right next to the apple (2, 5) vertically (4 units away) and close to (6, 0) diagonally. (6, 0) seems like the next closest reachable apple if we prioritize moving generally East/South. (2, 5) is closer if we move predominantly North.\n\nLet's evaluate the safest path towards the nearest viable apples, prioritizing movement that keeps us alive and doesn't lead us into a dead-end immediately.\n\nCurrent Head: (2, 1).\nMy Body (Tail (4, 4) will move if we don't eat): [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n\n**1. Safety Check for My Move (Head at (2, 1))**\nPossible moves from (2, 1):\n*   UP (2, 2): Collision with my body segment (2, 2). **FATAL**.\n*   DOWN (2, 0): Safe. (Not an apple)\n*   LEFT (1, 1): Safe. (Not an apple)\n*   RIGHT (3, 1): Safe. (Not an apple)\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake #1 at (1, 6))**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 6). Potential moves: (1, 7), (1, 5), (2, 6), (0, 6). No threat this turn.\n\n**3. Target Selection & Pathfinding**\n\nTarget A: (6, 0). Requires moving generally East then South. (Distance ~ 4 East, 1 South).\nTarget B: (2, 5). Requires moving North. (Distance 4 North).\nTarget C: (9, 2). Further away.\n\nIf we move UP to (2, 2), we hit ourselves. We must move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n*   **DOWN to (2, 0):** Moves us away from the center of gravity and all apples except (6, 0). We might need to come back up later. If we go DOWN, the tail at (4, 4) moves to (4, 5) (assuming we don't eat). If we go DOWN, Body becomes: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. This is safe.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 1):** Moves us toward the edge. Body becomes: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Moves us towards the center area. Body becomes: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. This seems like a good starting move to move East toward (6, 0) or North toward (2, 5).\n\nComparing RIGHT (3, 1) to LEFT (1, 1) and DOWN (2, 0):\nMoving RIGHT positions us better for moving towards X=6 apples ((6, 0), (6, 9)) or Y=5/Y=7 apples. Moving LEFT pushes us towards the far left wall (X=0). Moving DOWN takes us away from most apples instantly.\n\nRIGHT seems best to start the approach towards $(6, 0)$ or $(7, 7)$.\n\nPath to (6, 0): (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (6, 0) or (6, 1). This takes a while.\n\nLet's check the path to (2, 5) next turn if we move RIGHT:\nT14: (2, 1) -> RIGHT -> (3, 1).\nT15: (3, 1) -> UP -> (3, 2).\nT16: (3, 2) -> UP -> (3, 3) (Collision if tail clears (3, 3)). We need to ensure the tail clears the path.\n\nCurrent Tail is (4, 4).\nIf we move RIGHT to (3, 1): The body shifts, and the old tail (4, 4) is removed unless an apple is eaten. New body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Length 5.\nIf we move North from (3, 1) next turn to (3, 2), body length 5 remains: [(3, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Safe.\n\nIf we move UP to (2, 2), we die. We need to clear (2, 2) first. Moving RIGHT clears the space directly above us in terms of immediate collision risk, as the body shifts down the line.\n\nMove RIGHT to (3, 1) is the best choice to initiate progress towards the center/east cluster of apples while maintaining safety.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards the cluster of apples near X=6. Avoid the top edge for now as Y=9 is high. Maintain maximum distance from Snake #1 (currently at Y=6). The move RIGHT sets coordinates (3, 1) which allows for straight movement East next turn if safe (via UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT choices).\n\nRIGHT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

(Length 1 body implies (1, 6) was their starting position from a 'newborn' state or they lost segments, but given the board history, we assume length 1 at (1, 6) based on prior analysis).\n\n**Revisiting Last Move (Turn 14): RIGHT to (3, 1)**\nThe rationale stated the body after moving RIGHT would be: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. This is based on the *previous* head position (2, 1) moving and *not* eating an apple.\nPrevious state (Turn 13 resolution): Head (2, 1), Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Length 5 (since the apple at (2, 1) was just eaten, the length should have been 6, and the tail (4, 4) was the position *before* the tail moved).\n\nLet's re-establish the exact state after Turn 13 (eating apple at (2, 1)):\nTurn 13 Head: (2, 1). Length became 6.\nIf previous body was: [B1, B2, B3, B4, B5] where B1 was (2, 2).\nNew body (with new head H_new=(2, 1) and old body shifted, and tail retained): [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (T_old)].\nWait, the previous rationale stated:\n> Your snake (ID: 0): - Head: (2, 1) ... Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)] (Length 6, previously length 5, grew by 1)\n\nIf length is 6, the body list should have 5 elements if the head is included in the length count, or 5 elements if it's just the segments behind the head. Snake coordinates are Head: (H), Body: [B1, B2, ..., Bn]. Total Length = n+1.\nLength 6 means 5 body segments behind the head.\nIf Head was (X, Y) and it ate an apple, the new tail is (X, Y).\nIf previous state (Length 5) was: H:(1, 1), B:[(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. (Example body structure prior to eating at (2, 1)).\nIf we move DOWN to (2, 1) and eat: New Head (2, 1). New Body: [(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Wait, (4, 4) must have been the actual tail of the previous length 5 segment.\n\nLet's trust the provided *current* state listed at the beginning of Turn 15 generation, which reflects the outcome of Turn 14 execution:\n\n**Initial State for Turn 15** (Calculated from Turn 14 move RIGHT):\nHead: (3, 1)\nBody: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\nThis implies the length is 5 segments + 1 head = 6 total segments.\nThe segment that was at (4, 4) seems to have been dropped (as expected when not eating).\nThe segment that was at (2, 1) is now segment B1, meaning the move RIGHT from (2, 1) caused the previous body segment (2, 1) to become the new second segment, and the tail segment dropped off.\nIf Head was (2, 1) and Body was [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. Length 6.\nMove RIGHT -> New Head (3, 1). Segment (2, 1) drops off the tail.\nNew Body: [(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Length 4 segments. Wait, this contradicts the provided body list.\n\n**Crucial interpretation check:** The provided state description *at the start of Turn 15* must be taken as truth for subsequent move calculation, even if my internal model of the transition from Turn 13/14 was slightly off due to length tracking confusion in the rationale summary.\n\n**Current State (Start Turn 15):**\nHead: (3, 1).\nBody: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]. Length = 5 body segments + 1 head = 6 segments total.\nIf this is length 6, the tail segment (4, 3) will move/disappear if we don't eat.\n\n**1. Safety Check for My Move (Head at (3, 1))**\nPossible moves from (3, 1):\n*   UP (3, 2): Safe. (Not an apple)\n*   DOWN (3, 0): Safe. (Not an apple)\n*   LEFT (2, 1): Collision with body segment at (2, 1). **FATAL**. (Remember, moving backward into the segment directly preceding the head is always fatal if that segment is the old head position).\n*   RIGHT (4, 1): Safe. (Not an apple)\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 2), DOWN (3, 0), RIGHT (4, 1).\n\n**2. Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake #1 at (1, 6))**\nNo immediate threat.\n\n**3. Target Selection & Pathfinding**\nApples: (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (2, 5).\nCurrent position (3, 1). Body is relatively spread out towards (4, 3).\n\nTarget B: (2, 5) North is 4 units away.\nTarget A: (6, 0) Southeast is ~3 East, 1 South away initially.\n\nIf we choose RIGHT to (4, 1), we continue moving East towards the (6, 0) / (7, 7) cluster.\nIf we choose UP to (3, 2), we move towards the center and potentially closer to (2, 5).\n\nLet's pursue (6, 0) or (7, 7) as they are slightly more central and provide options for the next few moves without hitting the top boundary (Y=9) too soon.\n\nPath via RIGHT (4, 1):\nT15: (3, 1) -> RIGHT -> (4, 1). Body becomes [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]. Tail (4, 3) is dropped. Length remains 6 if we assume the length calculation implied the head was added, but here (4, 3) is dropped. Wait, if the length is 6 (5 body segments), and we move without eating, length becomes 5. The move RIGHT drops the segment (4, 3).\n\nPath via UP (3, 2):\nT15: (3, 1) -> UP -> (3, 2). Body becomes [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]. Tail (4, 3) is dropped. Length becomes 5.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems to put us in a better linear path towards X=6 than moving UP, which puts us back into the Y-axis alignment of our current body towards X=2/Y=5.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (4, 1), next desirable move might be (5, 1) or (4, 2). This looks like a steady advance towards the lower right apples.\n\nStrategy Update: Prioritize the cluster around (6, 0) and (7, 7). Continue moving generally Eastward.\n\nMove RIGHT to (4, 1).\n\n**Next Move Plan (Long Term Note Draft):**\nWe are moving East towards apples (6, 0) and (7, 7). From (4, 1), we should aim for (5, 1) next turn if safe. We need to monitor body clearance when moving towards (2, 5) later, but for now, East seems promising.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Safety Check (Head at (5, 1))**\nThe snake has shrunk significantly due to the immediate previous move (Turn 15). Old length was 6, now length 4 (Head + 3 segments). The tail segment (4, 3) from the previous turn fell off.\nCurrent Head: (5, 1).\nVisible Body segments: (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1). (The tail is now at (2, 1)).\n\nPotential Next Positions:\n*   UP (5, 2): Safe. (5, 2) is empty.\n*   DOWN (5, 0): Safe. (5, 0) is empty.\n*   LEFT (4, 1): Collision! This is segment B1. **FATAL**.\n*   RIGHT (6, 1): Safe. (6, 1) is empty.\n\nSafe moves: UP (5, 2), DOWN (5, 0), RIGHT (6, 1).\n\n**2. Enemy Collision Check (Snake #1 at (0, 6))**\nSnake #1 is far away at (0, 6). Simultaneous collision is impossible this turn.\n\n**3. Target Selection**\nWe are aiming for apples (9, 2), (6, 9), (6, 0), (7, 7), (2, 5).\nOur head is at (5, 1). We are prioritizing moving East (Right) to reach the cluster around X=6/X=7.\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Moves E +1. Next turn positions us well to continue East or turn towards (6, 0) or (7, 7). This is the most direct path toward the central cluster of apples (6, 0) and (7, 7).\n*   **UP (5, 2):** Moves N +1. Neutral direction, moving towards (2, 5) or (6, 9) eventually, but not optimizing for the immediate cluster.\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):** Moves S +1. This moves us towards (6, 0) if followed by a Right move, but takes us further from (7, 7) and (9, 2).\n\nThe previous rationale correctly identified that moving Eastward is beneficial. Moving RIGHT to (6, 1) continues this trajectory effectively.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 1), the body will shorten again (tail at (2, 1) falls off), resulting in length 3. This is acceptable as we are minimizing travel time to the apples without entering enclosed spaces.\n\nStrategy Note: Continue direct horizontal movement towards the cluster of apples (6, 0) and (7, 7) unless a better opportunity or immediate threat arises.\n\nRIGHT",

Empty cell.\n\nSafe moves (non-fatal): LEFT (5, 0), RIGHT (7, 0).\n\n**2. Collision Analysis with Snake #1 (At (0, 8))**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 8). Our possible moves are (5, 0) and (7, 0). There is no risk of immediate collision with Snake #1.\n\n**3. Target Selection**\nAvailable Apples: (9, 2), (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0).\n\nOur current position (6, 0) is good for heading towards the right side of the board to reach (7, 7) or (9, 2), or perhaps towards (0, 0) if we hug the bottom edge.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 0):** Moves us closer to the center-right quadrant where apples (7, 7) and (9, 2) reside. This is generally well-aligned with our longer-term goal of clearing the right side.\n*   **LEFT (5, 0):** Moves us towards (2, 5) or (0, 0) along the bottom edge.\n\nSince we just moved along $X=6$, a move to the RIGHT seems better to reorient towards the visible cluster of targets on the right half of the board ($(7, 7), (9, 2)$). Moving left to $(5, 0)$ means we hug the edge, which is slightly more restrictive path-wise, although $(0, 0)$ is an apple.\n\nLet's evaluate proximity:\n*   To (7, 7): (7, 0) -> (7, 1) -> ... (7 steps)\n*   To (0, 0): (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> ... (5 steps)\n\nBoth are reachable. Given we are length 5 now, we have some maneuvering room. Moving RIGHT keeps the path somewhat more open towards the middle board.\n\nI choose RIGHT to advance towards the rightmost apples (7, 7) and (9, 2), which are currently the most numerous cluster.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving generally right and slightly up to clear the high-Y apples (7, 7) and (6, 9). If the path to (0, 0) becomes clear and safer, we can divert later. Safety is currently high as moves are restricted only by our immediate body segment at (6, 1).\n\nRIGHT",

Previous head was (7, 0). New head is (6, 0).\nIf I moved DOWN from (7, 0) to (7, -1) that would be off-board.

Apples collected = 4.\nIf the last successful move (Turn 18) was DOWN, it means the snake started at (7, 1) or (X, Y) and moved to (7, 0), eating an apple at (6, 0)? This contradicts the coordinates.\n\nLet's trust the **Turn 19 State** provided immediately before choosing the move:\nHead: (7, 0). Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]. Length 4.\nThe list provided for the body `[(6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]` does *not* connect head (7, 0) to (6, 0) if the head moved there.

Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (7, -1):** Off board. **Fatal**.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 0):** Collision! This is B1 (the segment immediately behind the head). **Fatal**.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 0):** Safe. Empty cell.\n\nSafe moves (non-fatal): UP (7, 1), RIGHT (8, 0).\n\n---\n**2. Collision Analysis with Snake #1 (Head at (0, 7))**\n\nSnake #1 is far away at (0, 7). Neither safe move (7, 1) nor (8, 0) risks an immediate collision with E1's head. E1 will move this turn.\n\n---\n**3. Target Selection and Long-Term Planning**\n\nWe need to select between UP (7, 1) and RIGHT (8, 0).\n\nAvailable Apples: (9, 2), (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0).\n\nOur current position (7, 0) is on the bottom edge. We are well-placed to move towards the apples on the right side: (9, 2) and (7, 7).\n\n*   **UP (7, 1):** This moves us off the bottom edge and closer to Y=7, where apple (7, 7) resides. Next move could continue up (7, 2) or right (8, 1).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 0):** This moves us along the bottom edge, closer to (9, 2). Next move could be UP (8, 1) or further RIGHT (9, 0).\n\nEvaluating proximity:\nTarget (7, 7):\nIf UP: (7, 1). Distance to (7, 7) decreases by 1 in Y. (6 more steps needed along Y axis).\nIf RIGHT: (8, 0). Distance to (7, 7) changes from $\\sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} \\approx 9.9$ to $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + 7^2} = \\sqrt{1+49} \\approx 7.07$. This is a better instantaneous reduction in Manhattan distance towards (7, 7) than UP is, if we consider only the destination coordinates relative to the current location.\nManhattan distance (MD) from (7, 0):\nTo (7, 7): MD = 7.\nTo (9, 2): MD = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT (8, 0)**: MD to (9, 2) becomes 3. MD to (7, 7) becomes 7. (Better approach to (9, 2)).\nIf we move **UP (7, 1)**: MD to (9, 2) becomes 2 + 1 = 3. MD to (7, 7) becomes 6. (Better approach to (7, 7)).\n\nUP (7, 1) seems slightly more balanced, improving the line to (7, 7) while staying close enough to approach (9, 2). Since (7, 7) is higher up, navigating there might require getting off the $Y=0$ boundary sooner rather than later to have flexible upward paths.\n\nLet's look at the structure again. If we move RIGHT to (8, 0), our body is now: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)]. If we move UP to (7, 1), body is: [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)].\n\nIf we choose UP (7, 1), we immediately start heading towards (7, 7) which is a high priority target, and we avoid hugging the bottom edge further.\n\nLong Term Plan: Move UP to gain vertical presence, aiming towards the high-value apple at (7, 7). We must be careful not to get trapped if the path opens up poorly, but for now, UP is the most direct route into the 2nd row, setting up for future diagonal movements.\n\nMy chosen move based on maximizing proximity to the highest available target (7, 7) while moving off the restrictive bottom edge is UP.\n\nUP",

The provided body list `[(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1)]` suggests the tail expired, making the effective length 4 (or the original body list was incomplete/incorrectly stated in the Turn 19 context, but we must proceed with the current explicit coordinate list).

Target Selection and Path Evaluation**\n\nApples $A$: (9, 2), (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0).\n\nOur head is at (7, 1).

Moving right keeps us flexible for an upward trajectory towards (7, 7) later on (e.g., move to (8, 2) or (9, 1) then up).\n\n**Short-Term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (8, 1).

Next move to (9, 2) puts us closer to the center of the right edge structure.\n\nMoving UP feels slightly safer as it keeps us slightly more centralized for maneuvering towards the other apples if apple (9, 2) happens to be claimed by E1, or if we need to adjust course to intercept E1 later (though E1 is far).\n\nTarget sequence: (9, 2) -> (7, 7) -> (6, 9).\n\nIf we move UP (8, 2): Next move can be RIGHT (9, 2) OR UP (8, 3).\nIf we move RIGHT (9, 1): Next move must likely be UP (9, 2) to grab the apple.\n\nLet's choose UP (8, 2) to keep the option of moving further up grid, closer to the next target cluster around (7, 7) and (6, 9), while still securing the nearest apple next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move UP towards (8, 2). Next turn aim for (9, 2) by moving RIGHT. If (9, 2) is claimed by E1 (unlikely given E1's position at (2, 7)), then re-evaluate path towards (7, 7).

Wait, the last move recorded was RIGHT, and the apple list indicates (9,2) was an apple. The body list seems slightly off based on the last turn's rationale, which implied eating the apple. Let's reconcile the state based on the input description for T23.)\n\n**Reconciling T22 outcome before T23 decision:**\n\nT22 Analysis: Head (8, 2). Apple at (9, 2). Move RIGHT -> Eat apple at (9, 2).\nSnake State Transition (If RIGHT was chosen in T22):\nOld Head: (8, 2)\nOld Body: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)] (Length 5, Tail (6, 0))\nIf eaten, length increases to 6, and the tail does not drop off.\nNew Head H': (9, 2)\nNew Body B': [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)] (Length 6)\nScore: 6 apples.\n\n**The provided T23 state information shows:**\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (9, 2), Body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. Apples collected: 5.\n\n*Discrepancy*: My T22 rationale indicated eating (9, 2), which should have resulted in 6 apples and a body of length 6 where the tail (6,0) is still present. The provided state shows the head is at (9, 2) but the apple count remains 5, and the body length is 5, meaning the tail (6, 0) was dropped off despite eating an apple, OR the apple at (9, 2) was *not* eaten, but the head moved there, which contradicts the coordinates AND the apple list.\n\nLet's assume the provided T23 board state and snake data is absolute truth:\nH: (9, 2)\nB: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)] (Tail is (6, 0)). Length 5.\nApples collected: 5. This implies the move in T22 resulted in the snake moving to (9, 2) but *not* eating an apple, OR the apple list provided for T23 is missing the one at (9, 2) if the move succeeded, OR the T22 move was not RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the T23 Apple List: (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0), (2, 4). **Crucially, (9, 2) is NOT listed as an apple in T23.** This confirms that the apple at (9, 2) *was* eaten in T22, and we successfully moved to (9, 2).\nHowever, the score is still 5, and the body structure suggests a normal, non-growth move where the tail dropped off.\n\nIf the snake moved RIGHT to (9, 2) in T22, and the score is 5, this implies:\n1. The snake moved to (9, 2) (which was an apple).\n2. For some reason (perhaps T22 move was RIGHT but the apple wasn't registered, or my body tracking from T21 to T22 was flawed and the growth didn't happen), the score is 5, and the tail (6, 0) dropped off.\n\nSince H=(9, 2) and B=[(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)], this body list means the move in T22 was RIGHT (from (8, 2) to (9, 2)), and the tail (6, 0) was dropped off (because length is 5, and T21 snake had length 5 + 1 head = 6).\nT21 Body: [(8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)] <- Assuming T21 state, length 5 + head.\nIf T21 score was 5, and length 5, T22 move RIGHT from (8, 2) means the old tail (6, 0) should drop to (6, 1) (if it existed).\n\nLet's strictly adhere to the input T23 state:\nH=(9, 2), B=[(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0)]. Length 5. Score 5.\nThis state means the previous move caused the head to move to (9, 2), and the tail segment (6, 0) *was* removed, consistent with a snake moving without eating.\n\n**BUT, the T23 Apple List *does not* contain (9, 2).** This strongly implies (9, 2) was eaten in T22, meaning the score should be 6 and the tail should NOT have dropped off.\n\nGiven the direct contradiction between the score/body size (suggesting no growth and tail drop) and the apple list (suggesting an apple at the old position was confirmed eaten), I must prioritize safety and future aiming based on the current physical coordinates (H=(9, 2)) and the current apple locations: (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0), (2, 4).\n\n**Current Location of T0 Snake (T21 Body + T22 move RIGHT):**\nIf we assume the state provided is correct, the snake successfully navigated to (9, 2) and lost its tail segment (if it had one deeper than (6, 0)). Since the score is 5, we assume standard movement occurred.\n\nE1 Head: (2, 7).\n\n**1. Safety Check (Head at (9, 2))**\nPossible successors:\n1. UP: (9, 3). Safe. Empty.\n2. DOWN: (9, 1). Safe. Empty.\n3. LEFT: (8, 2). This is $B_1$. **Fatal (Self-collision)**.\n4. RIGHT: (10, 2). **Fatal (Off board)**.\n\nSafe moves: UP (9, 3), DOWN (9, 1).\n\n**2. Enemy Collision Check (E1 at (2, 7))**\nE1 is far away. No immediate collision risk. We are on the right edge.\n\n**3. Target Evaluation**\nApples: (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0), (2, 4).\nClosest apple: A1=(7, 7) or A3=(2, 5).\nDistance to (7, 7): $|9-7| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7$.\nDistance to (6, 9): $|9-6| + |2-9| = 3 + 7 = 10$.\nDistance to (2, 5): $|9-2| + |2-5| = 7 + 3 = 10$.\n\nThe closest apple is (7, 7) (MD=7). We need to move towards smaller X and larger Y.\n\nCurrent position (9, 2).\nMove UP to (9, 3): MD to (7, 7) reduces to $2 + 4 = 6$. (Good progress towards Y)\nMove DOWN to (9, 1): MD to (7, 7) increases to $2 + 6 = 8$. (Bad progress)\n\nMoving UP is clearly the preferred direction to re-engage the main cluster of apples.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nMove UP to (9, 3). Then, in subsequent turns, try to move LEFT towards X=7 and UP towards Y=7. Since we are constrained to the right edge, we must move UP until we clear Y=9, or until we can safely turn inwards towards X=8 or X=7. Moving to (9, 3) is the best start to minimize distance to (7, 7).\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nUP",

We proceed assuming no immediate external collision unless it forces us into a position where E1 could possibly reach us next turn (which is not the case here).\n\n**3. Apple Targeting & Pathing:**\nThe nearest apples are A(2, 5) (MD=5) and A(2, 4) (MD=5). A(7, 7) is MD=6 away. A(6, 9) is MD=7 away.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 5):** MD to A(7, 7) becomes $|9-7| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4$. MD to A(6, 9) becomes $|9-6| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7$. This brings us closer to (7, 7).\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 4):** MD to A(6, 9) becomes $|8-6| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7$. MD to A(7, 7) becomes $|8-7| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4$. MD to A(2, 5) becomes $|8-2| + |4-5| = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT reduce the distance to the closest apple (7, 7) by 1 step towards it, or result in an equal distance to other apples like (6, 9), while clearing the immediate threat of hitting the body segment at (9, 3).\n\nMoving UP to (9, 5) is generally better than moving LEFT to (8, 4). Why?\n1.  We are moving towards the higher density of apples on the right side of the board (A is at (7, 7) and (6, 9)).\n2.  Moving LEFT places us closer to the cluster of apples near X=2, but keeps us further from the high Y apples.\n3.  Given our previous move was also UP (from (9, 2) to (9, 3)), continuing the UP trend helps us reach the highest apples (Y=9) faster, which are currently uncollected high-value targets.\n\nWe prioritize moving toward the apple at (7, 7) or (6, 9). UP achieves a distance of 4 to (7, 7).\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving UP to maximize Y position, aiming for apples (6, 9) or (7, 7). We will leverage the top wall to turn left once we are high enough or have a clear path toward the centers.\n\nUP",

Empty cell.\n*   RIGHT -> Off board ($\\text{x}=10$). **Fatal**.\n\nSafe moves based on self-collision/boundaries: UP, LEFT.\n\n**2. Predict Enemy Movement (E1 at (2, 8)):**\nE1 is small (length 1). Its immediate goal is likely movement toward the central apples or just moving away from the top/left corner edge.\nThe nearest apples to E1 are (2, 5) and (2, 4). E1 is likely to move DOWN towards Y=7, Y=6, or even aim for the X=2 apples.\n\nPotential next positions for E1 (E1'):\nIf E1 moves UP to (2, 9): Very unlikely, hitting top wall.\nIf E1 moves DOWN to (2, 7): Moves towards X=2 apples.\nIf E1 moves LEFT to (1, 8): Moves away from X=2 apples.\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (3, 8): Moves away from X=2 apples.\n\nSince E1 is far from me (MD approx 13), I don't need to worry about immediate head-to-head collision or E1 moving into my space unless it has an extraordinarily fast path to me. I will assume E1 moves to (2, 7) or stays put relative to my current safe choices for now, prioritizing my own survival and apple trajectory.\n\n**3. Apple Targeting & Pathing from (9, 5):**\nClosest apples: (7, 7) (MD=4), (6, 9) (MD=5), (2, 5) (MD=7).\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 6):**\n    *   New MD to (7, 7): $|9-7| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Excellent progress towards (7, 7)).\n    *   New MD to (6, 9): $|9-6| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n    *   Maintains high Y position.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 5):**\n    *   New MD to (7, 7): $|8-7| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (Excellent progress towards (7, 7)).\n    *   New MD to (6, 9): $|8-6| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n    *   Moves toward the middle column, away from the right edge wall.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT make optimal progress (distance reduced by 1 relative to the best target (7, 7)).\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving UP keeps me along the safe upper edge (X=9), which is useful if I need to switch direction later towards (6, 9). Moving LEFT takes me inside the board area, moving me closer to the density of apples clustered near X=2, but I am still aiming for (7, 7) which is in the middle-right.\n\nGiven that the highest apple (6, 9) is still up high, continuing the upward thrust seems slightly more strategically sound to clear high-value targets early, while staying safe along the edge.\n\n**Final Check on Safety after potential E1 collision:**\nIf I move UP to (9, 6). Next turn, E1 could move to (2, 7). No collision threat.\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5). Next turn, E1 could move to (2, 7). No collision threat.\n\nI choose UP to continue maximizing Y coordinate and closing in on (7, 7) or (6, 9) while staying safely along the top boundary.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Continue moving UP until near Y=9 or until the path to (7, 7) is clearer via a horizontal move. Use the top wall to pivot if necessary to reach (6, 9).\n\nUP",

Sticking to the wall (UP) seems slightly safer and still aggressive towards the central cluster.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue aggressive pursuit of the middle-right apples ((7, 7) and (6, 9)) while maintaining awareness of the cluster near X=2. Prioritize safety along the top edge.

If the snake ate an apple on Turn 27, it should have length 6, meaning the segment that would have been dropped (if it didn't eat) is retained.\nLet's assume the structure implies Length $L = |Body| + 1 = 6$.\n\nSnake segments $S$: \\{(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)\\}.\nThe cell (8, 2) mentioned in the rationale conclusion for Turn 27 is NOT on the visual board state for Turn 28, nor is it in the provided body list for Turn 28. This suggests the move UP on Turn 27 did *not* consume an apple, and the snake SHRANK, contradicting the rationale which seemed to prepare for growth or assumed growth based on proximity to (7, 7).\n\n**CRITICAL REASSESSMENT BASED ON INPUT:**\nThe state provided for Turn 28 takes precedence:\nH = (9, 7).\nB = [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)]. Length = 6. (No apple eaten on the previous move).\nE1 Head = (3, 9).\nApples: (6, 9), (7, 7), (2, 5), (0, 0), (2, 4).\n\n**Safety Check for H=(9, 7):**\n*   UP -> (9, 8): Safe. Empty cell.\n*   DOWN -> (9, 6): Self-collision ($B_1$). **Fatal**.\n*   LEFT -> (8, 7): Safe. Empty cell.\n*   RIGHT -> Off board ($\\text{x}=10$). **Fatal**.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**2. Enemy E1 Analysis (E1 at (3, 9)):**\nE1 is moving this turn. E1 is currently near the top edge.\nIf E1 moves:\nUP -> (3, 10) (Off board, die)\nDOWN -> (3, 8) (Safe)\nLEFT -> (2, 9) (Safe)\nRIGHT -> (4, 9) (Safe)\n\nNo immediate collision threat as E1 is far from (9, 7).\n\n**3. Apple Targeting & Pathing from (9, 7):**\nClosest apples: (7, 7) (MD=2), (6, 9) (MD=4).\n(7, 7): $|9-7| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n(6, 9): $|9-6| + |7-9| = 3 + 2 = 5$. Wait, the previous MD calculation had (6, 9) at 6. Now it's 5.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 8):**\n    *   New MD to (7, 7): $|9-7| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Distance increased by 1).\n    *   New MD to (6, 9): $|9-6| + |8-9| = 3 + 1 = 4$. (Distance decreased by 1).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 7):**\n    *   New MD to (7, 7): $|8-7| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1$. (Distance decreased by 1, optimal).\n    *   New MD to (6, 9): $|8-6| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4$. (Distance decreased by 1).\n\n**Comparison:**\nBoth safe moves advance towards the target apples.\nLEFT to (8, 7) achieves the best possible approach to the nearest apple (7, 7), reducing MD from 2 to 1.\nUP to (9, 8) increases the distance to (7, 7) to 3, while only reducing distance to (6, 9) to 4.\n\nLEFT is the greedy optimal move to reach (7, 7) next turn (move RIGHT from (8, 7) to (9, 7) is impossible, move DOWN to (8, 6) or LEFT to (7, 7) might be possible next). Moving LEFT puts us in a strong position to reach (7, 7) on Turn 29 if we move DOWN or RIGHT next.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (8, 7):\nTurn 29 options from (8, 7):\nDOWN -> (8, 6). MD to (7, 7) = 1.\nRIGHT -> (9, 7). MD to (7, 7) = 2.\nLEFT -> (7, 7). **EAT APPLE (7, 7) if safe.**\n\nIf we move UP to (9, 8):\nTurn 29 options from (9, 8):\nDOWN -> (9, 7). MD to (7, 7) = 2.\nLEFT -> (8, 8). MD to (7, 7) = 2.\n\nThe move LEFT puts us in a position for a direct collision/eat move on (7, 7) on the next turn via moving LEFT again, provided (7, 7) is not taken by E1 (unlikely) or E1 is not targeting that path. E1 is nowhere near this region.\n\nStrategy: Move LEFT to maximize progress towards the nearest apple (7, 7).\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue to utilize the top right wall to maneuver towards the apple cluster at (6, 9) and (7, 7). Since the snake shrank last turn (or didn't grow), maintaining length is important. We should be extremely aggressive towards (7, 7) now.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nWhile the previous rationale concluded LEFT was optimal to reach (7, 7), let's re-verify safety assuming the move to (8, 7) occurs this turn.\n\nMove: LEFT to (8, 7).\nNew position (8, 7).\nBody $S$: \\{(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)\\}. The tail (9, 2) will be dropped since no apple was eaten.\n\n**Safety Check for next turn (Turn 29) from (8, 7), assuming no apple eaten this turn:**\nNext Head Position $H' = (8, 7)$. Body $B' = \\{(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)\\}$.\n\nFrom (8, 7), safe directions are:\n1. UP -> (8, 8). Safe.\n2. DOWN -> (8, 6). Safe.\n3. LEFT -> (7, 7). **EAT APPLE!**\n4. RIGHT -> (9, 7). Collision with $B_1$. **Fatal.** (My new head moves into my previous head position).\n\nIf we choose LEFT now, our follow-up move of LEFT in Turn 29 results in eating (7, 7) IF (7, 7) is still there. This confirms LEFT is the best aggressive move.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",
