          "rationale": "Let's break down the current state and plan our move step-by-step.\n\n### Current Snake State:\n- **Head**: (3, 0)\n- **Body**: None (just a single segment)\n- **Apples**: 0\n- **Enemy**: Snake #0 at (0, 4)\n\n### Board State (with apples marked 'A'):\n```\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A .\nRow 8: . . . . A . . . .\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A .\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . A . . . .\nRow 4: 0 . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . A . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . 1 . . . . .\n```\n(Note: Snake #0 is at (0, 4), Snake #1 is at (3, 0).)\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n1. **Off-board**: Moving up from (3, 0) would go to (3, 1), which is safe. Moving down would go to (4, 0), which is also safe. Moving left would go to (2, 0), which is safe. Moving right would go to (4, 0), which is safe (but let's check if it's safe later).\n2. **Self-collision**: Since the snake is just a single segment, moving in any direction won't immediately collide with itself (no body to collide with).\n3. **Enemy collision**: Snake #0 is at (0, 4). Its possible moves this turn:\n   - Up: (0, 3) - safe\n   - Down: (1, 4) - safe\n   - Left: (-1, 4) - off-board (dead)\n   - Right: (0, 5) - safe\n\n   Snake #0's head is at (0, 4). If it moves right to (0, 5), it could collide with our head if we move left to (2, 0) (but that's not the case here). However, we need to ensure our move doesn't put us in a position where we could collide with Snake #0's new position.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: (3, 1)\n   - Check if Snake #0 moves into our body: Snake #0 could move to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). None of these are in our path.\n   - Check if Snake #0's new position collides with our head: Snake #0's new position could be (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). Our head is at (3, 1), so no collision.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN**: (4, 0)\n   - Snake #0 could move to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). No collision with our head.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **LEFT**: (2, 0)\n   - Snake #0 could move to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). Our head is at (2, 0), so if Snake #0 moves to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5), no immediate collision.\n   - However, Snake #0 could move to (0, 5) and then collide with our head if we move left to (2, 0) and Snake #0 moves right to (0, 5). But since Snake #0's move is simultaneous, we need to consider if Snake #0 could move to (0, 5) and then collide with our head if we move left. But our head is at (2, 0), so no direct collision unless Snake #0 moves to (2, 0) (which it can't). So safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (4, 0)\n   - Snake #0 could move to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). Our head is at (4, 0), so no collision.\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (7, 7), (7, 9), (4, 8), (6, 5), and (2, 1).\n- Our head is at (3, 0). Moving up to (3, 1) is a safe step to move closer to the apples on the right side (e.g., (4, 8), (6, 5), etc.).\n\n### Future Options:\n- Moving up to (3, 1) allows us to explore the right side of the board, where apples are located.\n- Moving down to (4, 0) would move away from the apples.\n- Moving left to (2, 0) would move further away from the apples.\n- Moving right to (4, 0) would move away from the apples.\n\n### Snake #0's Strategy:\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4). It can move to (0, 3), (1, 4), or (0, 5). If it moves to (0, 5), it could potentially block our path to the apples on the right side.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving up to (3, 1) is the safest and most strategic move. It keeps us alive, moves us closer to apples, and avoids immediate threats.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\n- **Turn 1**: Move up to (3, 1).\n- **Turn 2**: Move up to (3, 2) or right to (4, 1) to explore the area around the apples at (4, 8) and (6, 5).\n- **Turn 3**: Try to reach (4, 8) or (6, 5) by moving diagonally or in a zigzag pattern.\n\nUP",

Immediate Safety Check**\n- **Current Position:** Head at `(3, 2)`.\n- **Last Move:** `UP` (from `(3, 1)` to `(3, 2)`).\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(2, 4)`, no body segments yet.\n  - If Snake #0 moves `UP` to `(2, 3)` or `LEFT` to `(1, 4)` this turn, it could collide with my tail (if extended) or head.\n  - However, since my body is empty, the only immediate collision risk is if Snake #0 moves into `(3, 2)` (my current head position). But since it\u2019s at `(2, 4)`, it cannot reach `(3, 2)` in one move unless it moves diagonally (which is not allowed in this game). Thus, **no immediate collision risk from Snake #0**.\n\n- **Self-Collision Risk:**\n  - Moving `UP` to `(3, 1)` is safe (no tail to block).\n  - Moving `DOWN` to `(4, 2)` is safe (no tail to block).\n  - Moving `LEFT` to `(2, 2)` is safe (no tail to block).\n  - Moving `RIGHT` to `(4, 2)` is safe (no tail to block).\n\n#### **2. Apple Proximity & Strategic Value**\n- **Closest Apple:** `(2, 1)` is **1 cell away** (`UP` from `(3, 2)`).\n  - If I move `UP` to `(3, 1)`, then `UP` again to `(3, 2)`, I can reach `(2, 1)` in 2 turns.\n  - However, this is a **short-term gain** with no long-term expansion.\n- **Longer-Range Apples:**\n  - `(4, 8)` and `(6, 5)` are farther but more strategically valuable.\n  - Moving `RIGHT` or `UP` in a controlled manner could set up a path toward these apples while keeping Snake #0 at bay.\n\n#### **3. Snake #0\u2019s Potential Moves**\n- Snake #0 is at `(2, 4)` with no body. It could:\n  - Move `UP` to `(2, 3)` or `LEFT` to `(1, 4)` this turn.\n  - If it moves `LEFT` to `(1, 4)`, it could block my path to `(4, 8)` if I try to expand right.\n  - If it moves `UP` to `(2, 3)`, it could interfere with my vertical expansion.\n\n#### **4. Risk vs. Reward Analysis**\n- **Moving `UP` to `(3, 1)`:**\n  - **Pros:** Reaches `(2, 1)` in 2 turns, gains 1 apple.\n  - **Cons:** No long-term expansion; Snake #0 could block future moves.\n- **Moving `RIGHT` to `(4, 2)`:**\n  - **Pros:** Expands horizontally toward `(4, 8)` and `(6, 5)`; keeps Snake #0 at bay if it doesn\u2019t move aggressively.\n  - **Cons:** Slower progress toward `(2, 1)`; requires careful follow-up to avoid Snake #0\u2019s interference.\n- **Moving `DOWN` to `(4, 2)`:**\n  - **Pros:** Similar to `RIGHT` but slightly less direct toward `(4, 8)`.\n  - **Cons:** Less ideal for long-term expansion.\n- **Moving `LEFT` to `(2, 2)`:**\n  - **Pros:** Avoids Snake #0\u2019s potential interference.\n  - **Cons:** No progress toward any apple; dead-end.\n\n#### **5. Optimal Move Selection**\n- **Prioritize Long-Term Expansion:** Moving `RIGHT` to `(4, 2)` is the best choice because:\n  - It sets up a path toward the cluster of apples at `(4, 8)` and `(6, 5)`.\n  - It avoids Snake #0\u2019s immediate interference by not moving directly toward its current position.\n  - It keeps future options open (e.g., `UP` or `RIGHT` from `(4, 2)`).\n- **Avoid Short-Term Gains at the Cost of Long-Term Strategy:** While `(2, 1)` is close, moving `UP` would lock me into a narrow path that could be blocked by Snake #0.\n\n#### **6. Final Decision**\nThe move `RIGHT` to `(4, 2)` is the safest and most strategic choice, balancing immediate progress with long-term expansion.\n\n---\n**Final Move:** RIGHT",

Avoid moving directly toward its new position.\n3. **Prioritize Apple `(6, 5)`:** This is the most distant but strategically valuable apple. Moving toward it requires a combination of horizontal and vertical expansion, so I should plan to `UP` or `RIGHT` from `(4, 2)` next turn.\n4. **Avoid Immediate Shortcuts:** While `(2, 1)` is close, moving `UP` now would lock me into a narrow path that could be blocked by Snake #0. Instead, I\u2019ll use this turn to secure a broader expansion.\n5. **Watch for Snake #0\u2019s Growth:** If it grows this turn (e.g., by eating an apple), its body will constrain my future moves.

          "rationale": "**Rationale:**\n\n**Board recap**\n- Our snake (ID 0) head: (1,4), body [(2,4), (3,4)], 2 apples.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head: (8,6), body [(7,6)], 1 apple.\n- Apples: (7,7), (7,9), (4,8), (2,0), (6,3).\n\n**Safety check**\n- UP: (1,5) \u2014 not on board edges, not in our body [(2,4), (3,4)], not in enemy body [(7,6)]. This move is safe.\n- DOWN: (1,3) \u2014 safe.\n- LEFT: (0,4) \u2014 safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,4) \u2014 this is our own body segment, so it would kill us. Eliminate.\n\n**Enemy snake movement consideration**\nEnemy head at (8,6) with body at (7,6). The enemy can move UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5), LEFT to (7,6) (its own body, so it would die), or RIGHT to (9,6). If the enemy moves LEFT it would die, so the only safe moves for the enemy are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. We must avoid moving into (8,7), (8,5), or (9,6) to prevent head-on collision.\n\n**Reachable apple analysis**\n- We are at (1,4). The apple at (2,0) is reachable in Manhattan distance 5 (4 down + 2 right). The apple at (6,3) is reachable in Manhattan distance 6 (5 right + 1 down). The apple at (4,8) is reachable in Manhattan distance 8 (3 right + 4 up). The apple at (7,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 11 (6 right + 3 up). The apple at (7,9) is far.\n- The enemy is at (8,6). The apple at (7,7) is only 1 up away. The apple at (6,3) is 2 left + 3 down. The apple at (4,8) is 4 left + 2 up. The apple at (7,9) is 3 up. The apple at (2,0) is 6 left + 6 down.\n\n**Head-on collision avoidance**\n- If we move UP to (1,5), the enemy could also move UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5), or RIGHT to (9,6). None of these intersect our new position, so no head-on collision risk.\n- If we move DOWN to (1,3), the enemy could move UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5), or RIGHT to (9,6). Again, no intersection.\n- If we move LEFT to (0,4), the enemy's possible moves do not intersect.\n\n**Blocking and trapping**\n- Our body extends rightward from (1,4) to (3,4). Moving DOWN to (1,3) or UP to (1,5) does not immediately block our next move options. Moving LEFT to (0,4) also leaves options open.\n- Moving DOWN to (1,3) brings us closer to the apple at (2,0) and also closer to the apple at (6,3) in terms of y-coordinate alignment (we'll be at y=3, same as (6,3)).\n\n**Strategy considerations**\n- The enemy is likely to go for the apple at (7,7) on its next move (UP to (8,7) would not reach it, but a move RIGHT to (9,6) followed by UP to (9,7) is unlikely; more likely it will move UP to (8,7) to get closer to (7,7) or move RIGHT to (9,6) to avoid immediate confrontation). We should avoid going towards (7,7).\n- Our best target seems to be the apple at (6,3). It is closer in terms of y-coordinate if we move DOWN to (1,3). From (1,3) we can move rightward along y=3 to intercept it.\n- Moving DOWN also avoids moving into the enemy's likely path towards (7,7) or (4,8).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe move DOWN to (1,3) is safe, moves us closer to the apple at (6,3), and keeps multiple follow-up options open while avoiding the enemy's likely path.\n\n**Plan for next few turns**\n1. Move DOWN to (1,3).\n2. If the apple at (6,3) is still there and enemy is not blocking, move RIGHT repeatedly along y=3 to reach it.\n3. After eating (6,3), consider moving UP to y=4 and then RIGHT to head towards (7,7) if it's still available and enemy is not there.\n\nDOWN",

This move is safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) \u2014 safe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) \u2014 this is the snake's own body segment, so it would kill us. Eliminate.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) \u2014 safe.\n\n**Enemy snake movement consideration**\nEnemy head at (8,4) with body at (8,5). The enemy can move UP to (8,5) (its own body, so it would die), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). The only safe moves for the enemy are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. We must avoid moving into (8,3), (7,4), or (9,4) to prevent head-on collision.\n\n**Reachable apple analysis**\n- We are at (2,3). The apple at (6,3) is reachable in Manhattan distance 4 (4 right + 0 up/down). The apple at (2,0) is reachable in Manhattan distance 3 (0 right + 3 down). The apple at (4,8) is reachable in Manhattan distance 9 (2 right + 5 up). The apple at (7,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 10 (5 right + 4 up). The apple at (7,9) is far.\n- The enemy is at (8,4). The apple at (7,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 4 (1 left + 3 up). The apple at (6,3) is reachable in Manhattan distance 3 (2 left + 1 down). The apple at (4,8) is reachable in Manhattan distance 7 (4 left + 4 up). The apple at (7,9) is reachable in Manhattan distance 6 (1 left + 5 up). The apple at (2,0) is reachable in Manhattan distance 12 (6 left + 4 down).\n\n**Head-on collision avoidance**\n- If we move UP to (2,4), the enemy could move DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). None of these intersect our new position, so no head-on collision risk.\n- If we move DOWN to (2,2), the enemy's possible moves do not intersect.\n- If we move RIGHT to (3,3), the enemy's possible moves do not intersect.\n\n**Blocking and trapping**\n- Our body extends upward from (2,3) to (1,3) and then upward to (1,4). Moving UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2) does not immediately block our next move options. Moving RIGHT to (3,3) also leaves options open.\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,3) brings us closer to the apple at (6,3) in terms of x-coordinate alignment (we'll be at x=3, same as the apple at (2,0) and closer to (6,3)).\n- Moving DOWN to (2,2) brings us closer to the apple at (2,0) in terms of y-coordinate alignment (we'll be at y=2, same as the apple at (2,0)).\n\n**Strategy considerations**\n- The enemy is likely to go for the apple at (6,3) on its next move (LEFT to (7,4) followed by LEFT to (6,4) and then DOWN to (6,3) is a likely path). We should avoid going towards (6,3) if it means we will collide with the enemy.\n- Our best target seems to be the apple at (2,0). It is closer in terms of y-coordinate if we move DOWN to (2,2). From (2,2) we can move down to (2,1) and then down to (2,0) to eat it.\n- Moving DOWN also avoids moving into the enemy's likely path towards (6,3) or (7,7).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe move DOWN to (2,2) is safe, moves us closer to the apple at (2,0), and keeps multiple follow-up options open while avoiding the enemy's likely path.\n\n**Plan for next few turns**\n1. Move DOWN to (2,2).\n2. If the apple at (2,0) is still there and enemy is not blocking, move DOWN repeatedly along x=2 to reach it.\n3. After eating (2,0), consider moving RIGHT to x=3 and then UP to head towards (6,3) if it's still available and enemy is not there.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves:\n- UP: (2,1) \u2014 this is our own body segment, so it would kill us. Eliminate.\n- DOWN: (2,-1) \u2014 this is off the board (y < 0), so it would kill us. Eliminate.\n- LEFT: (1,0) \u2014 not on board edges, not in our body [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)], not in enemy body [(7,5)]. This move is safe.\n- RIGHT: (3,0) \u2014 not on board edges, not in our body [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)], not in enemy body [(7,5)]. This move is safe.\n\n**Enemy snake movement consideration**\nEnemy head at (7,6) with body at (7,5). The enemy can move UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5) (its own body, so it would die), LEFT to (6,6), or RIGHT to (8,6). The safe moves for the enemy are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. We must avoid moving into (7,7), (6,6), or (8,6) to prevent head-on collision.\n\n**Reachable apple analysis**\n- We are at (2,0). The apple at (6,3) is reachable in Manhattan distance 7 (4 right + 3 up). The apple at (2,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 7 (0 right/left + 7 up). The apple at (4,8) is reachable in Manhattan distance 10 (2 right + 8 up). The apple at (7,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 12 (5 right + 7 up). The apple at (7,9) is far.\n- The enemy is at (7,6). The apple at (7,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 1 (0 left/right + 1 up). The apple at (6,3) is reachable in Manhattan distance 4 (1 left + 3 down). The apple at (4,8) is reachable in Manhattan distance 5 (3 left + 2 up). The apple at (7,9) is reachable in Manhattan distance 3 (0 left/right + 3 up). The apple at (2,7) is reachable in Manhattan distance 12 (5 left + 1 up).\n\n**Head-on collision avoidance**\n- If we move LEFT to (1,0), the enemy's possible moves do not intersect our new position.\n- If we move RIGHT to (3,0), the enemy's possible moves do not intersect.\n\n**Blocking and trapping**\n- Our body extends upward from (2,0) to (2,1) and then upward to (2,2) and then upward to (2,3). Moving LEFT to (1,0) or RIGHT to (3,0) does not immediately block our next move options. Both moves leave options open.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,0) brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of x-coordinate alignment (we'll be at x=1, same as the apple at (2,7) is at x=2, so we can move right to (2,0) then up to (2,1) then up to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then up to (2,4) then up to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7)).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,0) brings us closer to the apple at (6,3) in terms of x-coordinate alignment (we'll be at x=3, same as the apple at (6,3) is at x=6, so we can move right to (4,0) then right to (5,0) and then right to (6,0) and then up to (6,1) and then up to (6,2) and then up to (6,3)).\n\n**Strategy considerations**\n- The enemy is likely to go for the apple at (7,7) on its next move (UP to (7,7) is a likely path). We should avoid going towards (7,7) if it means we will collide with the enemy.\n- Our best target seems to be the apple at (2,7). It is directly reachable in 7 moves if we move LEFT to (1,0) then right to (2,0) then up to (2,1) then up to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then up to (2,4) then up to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,0) also brings us closer to the apple at (6,3) in terms of x-coordinate alignment (we'll be at x=3, same as the apple at (6,3) is at x=6, so we can move right to (4,0) then right to (5,0) and then right to (6,0) and then up to (6,1) and then up to (6,2) and then up to (6,3)).\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves. Moving LEFT to (1,0) brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of x-coordinate alignment. Moving RIGHT to (3,0) brings us closer to the apple at (6,3) in terms of x-coordinate alignment. Since the apple at (2,7) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (7) compared to the apple at (6,3) (7), both are equally close. However, moving LEFT to (1,0) avoids moving into the enemy's likely path towards (7,7) and keeps us on the left side of the board, which might be safer.\n\n**Plan for next few turns**\n1. Move LEFT to (1,0) to keep options open and avoid the enemy's likely path towards (7,7).\n2. From (1,0), consider moving right to (2,0) then up to (2,1) then up to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then up to (2,4) then up to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7) to eat the apple at (2,7).\n3. If the apple at (2,7) is not there (e.g., if the enemy eats it first), consider moving right to (3,0) then right to (4,0) then right to (5,0) and then right to (6,0) and then up to (6,1) and then up to (6,2) and then up to (6,3) to eat the apple at (6,3).\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,0) does not immediately block our next move options. Both moves leave options open.\n- Moving LEFT to (0,0) brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of x-coordinate alignment (we'll be at x=0, same as the apple at (2,7) is at x=2, so we can move right to (1,0) then right to (2,0) then up to (2,1) then up to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then up to (2,4) then up to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7)).\n- Moving UP to (1,1) also brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of both x and y coordinates (we'll be at (1,1), same as the apple at (2,7) is at (2,7), so we can move right to (2,1) then up to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then up to (2,4) then up to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7)).\n\n**Strategy considerations**\n- The enemy is likely to go for the apple at (7,9) on its next move (UP to (7,8) then UP to (7,9) is a likely path).

Moving UP to (1,1) brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of both x and y coordinates. Moving LEFT to (0,0) brings us closer to the apple at (2,7) in terms of x-coordinate alignment. Since the apple at (2,7) is equally close in terms of Manhattan distance (8) from both positions, both moves are equally good.
