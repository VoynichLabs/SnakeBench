My snake (ID 0) is at (8, 9) and is 1 unit long.\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (2, 8), (6, 6), (1, 0), (9, 4), (7, 6).\nMy objective is to maximize my apple count while staying alive.\n\nMy current position is (8, 9).\n\n1. **Evaluate safe moves:**\n   * **UP:** (8, 10). Out of bounds (Y > 9). **Dead.**\n   * **DOWN:** (8, 8). Safe.\n   * **LEFT:** (7, 9). Safe.\n   * **RIGHT:** (9, 9). Safe.\n\n2. **Analyze remaining safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and proximity to apples:**\n\nApples locations: (2, 8), (6, 6), (1, 0), (9, 4), (7, 6).\n\n* **Move DOWN to (8, 8):**\n    * Distance to nearest apples:\n        * (7, 6): Manhattan distance: $|8-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n        * (9, 4): Manhattan distance: $|8-9| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n        * (6, 6): Manhattan distance: $|8-6| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n        * (2, 8): Manhattan distance: $|8-2| + |8-8| = 6 + 0 = 6$.\n    * This move brings me closer to the center of the board where many apples are located. It also directly positions me in the row below my starting position.\n\n* **Move LEFT to (7, 9):**\n    * Distance to nearest apples:\n        * (7, 6): Manhattan distance: $|7-7| + |9-6| = 0 + 3 = 3$.\n        * (2, 8): Manhattan distance: $|7-2| + |9-8| = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n        * (9, 4): Manhattan distance: $|7-9| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7$.\n    * This maintains a high Y coordinate, which might not be ideal since most visible apples are at lower Y coordinates (8, 6, 4, 0).\n\n* **Move RIGHT to (9, 9):**\n    * Distance to nearest apples:\n        * (9, 4): Manhattan distance: $|9-9| + |9-4| = 0 + 5 = 5$.\n        * (7, 6): Manhattan distance: $|9-7| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n    * This keeps me on the edge of the board and slightly closer to (9, 4), but (9, 4) is still 5 moves away.\n\n3. **Consider opponent (Snake #1 at (5, 5)):**\nSnake #1 is centralized. It can potentially target (6, 6) or (7, 6).\n\nMy goal is to reach the cluster of apples around the upper-right area: (7, 6), (6, 6), and (2, 8).\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (8, 8) seems like the best starting move.\n1. It moves me away from the wall.\n2. It sets up an approach toward (7, 6) (3 moves away), (6, 6) (4 moves away), and (9, 4) (5 moves away).\n3. If I move LEFT to (7, 9), I have to move DOWN twice to get to Y=7, and then potentially DOWN again to Y=6.\n4. If I move DOWN to (8, 8), I can next move LEFT to (7, 8) and then DOWN to (7, 7) or (7, 6).\n\nLet's estimate paths to (7, 6):\n* Start (8, 9).\n* Path 1 (via DOWN): (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6). Total 4 moves (D, L, D, D).\n* Path 2 (via LEFT): (7, 9) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6). Total 3 moves (L, D, D, D). Wait, $(7, 9) \\to (7, 8)$ is D, $(7, 8) \\to (7, 7)$ is D, $(7, 7) \\to (7, 6)$ is D. Total 4 moves (L, D, D, D). Re-calculating:\n    * (8, 9) $\\to$ (7, 9) [L, 1 move] $\\to$ (7, 8) [D, 2 moves] $\\to$ (7, 7) [D, 3 moves] $\\to$ (7, 6) [D, 4 moves]. Manhattan distance is 3, but the path takes 4 moves if sticking to cardinal directions one at a time. Oh, the Manhattan distance is 3: $|8-7| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4$. My initial calculation was wrong.\n    * Path 1 (via DOWN): (8, 9) $\\to$ (8, 8) [D, 1 move]. Current position (8, 8). Distance to (7, 6) is 3. Path takes 1+3 = 4 moves total. (D, L, D, D).\n    * Path 2 (via LEFT): (8, 9) $\\to$ (7, 9) [L, 1 move]. Current position (7, 9). Distance to (7, 6) is 3. Path takes 1+3 = 4 moves total. (L, D, D, D).\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT result in an overall 4-move path to (7, 6).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 8), I am 2 units away from where Snake #1 (5, 5) might head (e.g., if S1 goes RIGHT to (6, 5) and then UP twice, it gets to (6, 7)). Snake #1 is 1 unit away from (6, 6) and 2 units away from (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 targets (6, 6): S1 could go UP, RIGHT, UP (3 moves).\nIf S1 targets (7, 6): S1 could go UP, RIGHT, UP, RIGHT (4 moves).\n\nSince I am further away and S1 is centralized, S1 is likely heading towards (6, 6) or (7, 6).\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 8) puts me in a more open space than moving LEFT to (7, 9). If I move LEFT, I am still confined by the Y=9 wall. Moving DOWN allows me to navigate more freely.\n\nI will choose DOWN to position myself to intercept the apples on the right side (7, 6) or (9, 4), or potentially pivot left towards (6, 6) or (2, 8).\n\nDOWN is a safe and flexible introductory move.\n\nMy plan is to proceed towards (7, 6) or (6, 6), prioritizing the lower right cluster of apples. (7, 6) is currently slightly closer than (6, 6) or (9, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n   * **DOWN:** (8, 7). Safe.\n   * **LEFT:** (7, 8). Safe.\n   * **RIGHT:** (9, 8). Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe (not out of bounds, no collision risk as S0 and S1 are far apart, and S0 is minimal length).\n\n2. **Analyze Apple Proximity (using Manhattan Distance from (8, 8)):**\n| Apple | Location | Distance ($D_{M}$) |\n|---|---|---|\n| A1 | (7, 6) | $|8-7| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3$ |\n| A2 | (6, 6) | $|8-6| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4$ |\n| A3 | (9, 4) | $|8-9| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5$ |\n| A4 | (2, 8) | $|8-2| + |8-8| = 6 + 0 = 6$ |\n| A5 | (1, 0) | $|8-1| + |8-0| = 7 + 8 = 15$ |\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n*   **1. Move UP to (8, 9):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6): $|8-7| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4$. (Increased distance to target cluster.)\n    *   This moves away from the apples and limits vertical movement options upward again. Undesirable.\n\n*   **2. Move RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6): $|9-7| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4$. (Same distance as $D_M(8, 8)$ to (6, 6)).\n    *   $D_M$ to (9, 4): $|9-9| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4$.\n    *   This keeps me on the edge but directly aligns me vertically for (9, 4). If (7, 6) or (6, 6) are contested, pivoting for (9, 4) is a good alternative.\n\n*   **3. Move DOWN to (8, 7):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6): $|8-7| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2$. **(Closest)**\n    *   This is the best move to quickly approach the contested apple cluster (7, 6) and (6, 6).\n\n*   **4. Move LEFT to (7, 8):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6): $|7-7| + |8-6| = 0 + 2 = 2$. **(Tied Closest)**\n    *   This also achieves the minimum distance of 2 to (7, 6).\n\n**Tie-breaking between DOWN (8, 7) and LEFT (7, 8):**\n\nBoth moves get me $D_M=2$ from (7, 6). Let's check proximity to other apples.\n\n| Post-Move Pos | D to (7, 6) | D to (6, 6) | D to (9, 4) | D to (2, 8) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| (8, 7) [DOWN] | 2 | 3 | 4 | 7 |\n| (7, 8) [LEFT] | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5 |\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 8) puts me 5 units away from (2, 8) (which is now closer than from (8, 8)), but it increases my distance to (9, 4) slightly (5 vs 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7), my next move could be LEFT to (7, 7) and then DOWN to hit (7, 6) in 2 moves (D, L, D - wait, original position (8, 8)).\nPath (8, 8) $\\to$ (8, 7) [D, 1 move].\nFrom (8, 7): $\\to$ (7, 7) [L, 2 moves] $\\to$ (7, 6) [D, 3 moves].

Total 3 moves to apple (7, 6).\n\nBoth paths take 3 steps if S1 is not interfering.\n\n**Considering S1's move:**\nS1 is at (6, 5). S1 is 1 move from (6, 6) (UP) and 2 moves from (7, 6) (UP, RIGHT or RIGHT, UP).\nIf S1 moves UP $\\to$ (6, 6), S1 eats the apple (6, 6) immediately.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT $\\to$ (7, 5), S1 is 1 move from (7, 6) (UP) or 2 moves from (6, 6) (LEFT, UP).\n\nSince (6, 6) is immediate for S1, S1 is highly likely to take (6, 6). This means I should pivot to maximize my chance for (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 takes (6, 6) (moves UP):\nOur path to (7, 6) remains 3 moves (via L $\\to$ D $\\to$ D or D $\\to$ L $\\to$ D).\n\nLet's look at the density of available space.\n(8, 7) [DOWN] leaves me flexibility to go LEFT towards the central apples or RIGHT towards (9, 4).\n(7, 8) [LEFT] is slightly more constrained by the (2, 8) apple to the far left.\n\nSince S1 is likely heading for X=6, I want to stay slightly further right/down to avoid potential conflict if S1 pivots away from (6, 6) or if I decide to pursue (9, 4) instead.\n\nMove DOWN to (8, 7). This maintains a higher X coordinate, keeping the possibility of easily reaching (9, 4) (4 units away) or continuing LEFT to (7, 6) (2 units away).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8), I am now 5 units from (9, 4).\n\nI prefer the flexibility offered by moving DOWN, especially since the apple (7, 6) is the immediate priority (3 moves away), and moving DOWN prepares me for both (7, 6) and (9, 4) better than moving LEFT.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (8, 7), approaching (7, 6). If (7, 6) is taken, pivot towards (9, 4) or (2, 8).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (8, 6). Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (7, 7). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (9, 7). Safe.\nAll moves are safe as we are length 1 and opponent is far.\n\n**2. Analyze Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance $D_M$ from (8, 7)):**\n| Apple | Location | $D_M$ |\n|---|---|---|\n| A1 | (7, 6) | $|8-7| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2$ |\n| A2 | (6, 6) | $|8-6| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3$ |\n| A3 | (9, 4) | $|8-9| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4$ |\n| A4 | (2, 8) | $|8-2| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7$ |\n| A5 | (1, 0) | $|8-1| + |7-0| = 7 + 7 = 14$ |\n\nThe closest apple is (7, 6) at $D_M=2$.\n\n**3. Evaluate Candidate Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 8):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6) becomes 3. This steps backwards, increasing the distance. Bad move.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 6):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6) becomes $|8-7| + |6-6| = 1$. **(Best for A1)**\n    *   $D_M$ to (9, 4) becomes $|8-9| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3$. (Good for A3)\n    *   This puts me $1$ move away from (7, 6) (next move LEFT) and keeps high flexibility for (9, 4).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 7):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6) becomes $|7-7| + |7-6| = 1$. **(Best for A1)**\n    *   Next move DOWN hits (7, 6) immediately.\n    *   $D_M$ to (6, 6) becomes $|7-6| + |7-6| = 2$.\n    *   This is a direct path to (7, 6).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    *   $D_M$ to (7, 6) becomes 3. (Moves away from A1). Bad move.\n\n**4. Tie-breaking between DOWN (8, 6) and LEFT (7, 7):**\n\nBoth moves result in $D_M=1$ to (7, 6), meaning the apple can be reached in the next turn (Turn 3).\n\n| Post-Move Pos | Next Apple Path | D to (9, 4) | D to (6, 6) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| (8, 6) [DOWN] | LEFT to (7, 6) | 3 | 2 |\n| (7, 7) [LEFT] | DOWN to (7, 6) | 5 | 2 |\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 6) keeps me in a better position relative to the alternate apple (9, 4) (3 units vs 5 units). If, for some reason, Snake 1 goes for (7, 6), or if a collision risk arises, I can easily pivot to (9, 4).\n\n**5. Considering Enemy Snake 1 (at (5, 5)):**\nS1 is likely attempting to reach (6, 6) (1 move UP, 1 move RIGHT/LEFT), or (7, 6) (2 moves).\n\n*   If S1 moves UP $\\to$ (5, 6) (1 move towards center).\n    *   From (5, 6), S1 is 1 move from (6, 6) (RIGHT) and 2 moves from (7, 6) (RIGHT, RIGHT or RIGHT, UP).\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT $\\to$ (6, 5) (1 move towards center).\n    *   From (6, 5), S1 is 1 move from (6, 6) (UP) and 2 moves from (7, 6) (UP, RIGHT).\n*   If S1 moves UP, then in Turn 3 S1 moves RIGHT to hit (6, 6), S1 gets (6, 6) on Turn 3. (Path: U $\\to$ R).\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT, then in Turn 3 S1 moves UP to hit (6, 6), S1 also gets (6, 6) on Turn 3. (Path: R $\\to$ U).\n\nSince (7, 6) is 3 moves away for S1's fastest path (e.g., R $\\to$ U $\\to$ R to (7, 6) on T4, or U $\\to$ R $\\to$ R to (7, 6) on T4), and I can reach it by T3, I am clearly ahead on (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5) and I move LEFT to (7, 7).\nIn T3: S1 moves UP to (6, 6) (eats apple). I move DOWN to (7, 6) (eats apple). Simultaneous double score. This is acceptable.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5) and I move DOWN to (8, 6).\nIn T3: S1 moves UP to (6, 6) (eats apple). I move LEFT to (7, 6) (eats apple). Still acceptable.\n\nThe DOWN move to (8, 6) provides slightly better flexibility for (9, 4) and avoids taking an X coordinate that S1 is currently approaching (S1 is moving from 5 toward 6/7). By moving DOWN, I am using the Y axis to gain distance while remaining horizontally away from S1's approach line.\n\nDecision: Move DOWN to (8, 6). Next move LEFT to (7, 6) to eat the apple.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1. T2: Move DOWN to (8, 6).\n2. T3: Move LEFT to (7, 6) (Eat Apple A1). Length becomes 2.\n3. T4: Assess new apple locations and S1's growth/position. Likely target (9, 4) or (2, 8).\n\nDOWN",

The fastest move is across 2 dimensions (e.g., UP to (6, 6), then RIGHT to (7, 6)). Thus, I secure the apple unimpeded by S1.\n\n*   **S1's Likely Move:** S1 is perfectly positioned to move UP to (6, 6) and secure that apple.\n\n*   **Outcome Prediction for Turn 3:**\n    *   I move LEFT to (7, 6). Snack Apple A. Score: 1.\n    *   S1 moves UP to (6, 6). Snac Apple B. Score: 1.\n    *   This result is ideal: we both score an apple simultaneously, achieving our immediate local objectives without collision.\n\n**4. Confirm Safety and Execution:**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 6) is safe. There are no obstacles (self, opponent body, walls) and it results in scoring an apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T4 onwards):**\n1.

I should target (9, 4), which is 2 moves away (RIGHT $\\to$ DOWN) or (2, 8). (9, 4) is closer ($D_M=4$) than (2, 8) ($D_M=9$). S1 is 4 moves from (9, 4) ($D_M=|6-9| + |6-4| = 5$).

Length 1.\nApples are at: (2, 8), (6, 6), (1, 0), (9, 4), (1, 2). (Note: two apples were consumed in Turn 3: my snake consumed (7, 6) and S1 consumed (6, 6) based on the current board state showing only five apples remaining and S1's position relative to the apple at (6, 6) in T3).\n\nLet's re-verify the apples consumed in T3 based on the board/reports:\nT3 reports: My snake moved LEFT: (8, 6) -> (7, 6). The board shows (7, 6) is now my head \"0\". This implies I ate the apple at (7, 6). My current body is [(7, 6), (8, 6)].\nT3 reports: Snake #1 moved RIGHT: (6, 5) -> (7, 5). The board shows (7, 5) is S1's head \"1\". S1 did *not* eat the apple at (6, 6) or (7, 6).\n\nWait, the board displayed in the prompt for Turn 4 shows:\nApples at: (2, 8), (6, 6), (1, 0), (9, 4), (1, 2).\n\nThis means:\n1. I ate (7, 6) on T3. My apple count increased to 1. My tail (8, 6) is present.\n2. (6, 6) is *still an apple*.\n3. Snake #1 moved from (6, 5) to (7, 5). S1 did not eat any apple.\n\nSo the previous rationale's prediction about S1 eating (6, 6) was wrong. S1 made a potentially defensive/neutral move or chose to approach my area by moving RIGHT (6, 5) -> (7, 5).\n\n**Immediate Goals:**\n1. Secure the apple at (6, 6). It is 1 move away (LEFT).\n2. Avoid collision with S1, currently one space below me at (7, 5).\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves from (7, 6):**\nThe body is (8, 6). The space immediately behind the head (7, 6) is (8, 6).\n\n*   **UP:** (7, 7). Safe. Moves slightly away from immediate apples.\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 5). **Immediate Head-on Collision Risk!** S1 is there and S1 might also move UP to (7, 6) or stay put or move elsewhere. If S1 moves UP to (7, 6), and I move DOWN to (7, 5), S1's path is free. If S1 stays, and I move DOWN, I cause a head-on collision. **DANGER! Eliminate.**\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 6). **Apple!** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 6). **Self-collision!** This is my body/tail. Since I just grew, (8, 6) is my tail segment. I cannot move into it. **Eliminate.**\n\n*Safe and Optimal Move Candidates: LEFT (to (6, 6)).*\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (at (7, 5)) Intentions:**\nS1 is length 1. S1 has 0 apples.\nS1 is one square away from the apple at (6, 6) (1 move LEFT, then 1 move UP, or 2 moves if they move diagonal/indirectly).\nS1 is one square away from me (7, 6).\n\nPossible moves for S1:\n1. **UP (to 7, 6):** S1 targets my current head position. If I move LEFT (6, 6), S1 is safe and wastes a turn moving into empty space where I just was.\n2. **DOWN (to 7, 4):** Moves towards the apple at (9, 4) or away from conflict.\n3. **LEFT (to 6, 5):** Prepares to move UP to (6, 6) on the next turn (T5).\n4. **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** Moves away from conflict. Prepares for (9, 4) (3 moves).\n\n**3. Evaluate Competitive Moves (Moving LEFT to (6, 6)):**\n\nIf I move **LEFT (to 6, 6)**:\n*   I score an apple. My length becomes 3. Head (6, 6), Body [(7, 6), (8, 6)].\n*   S1 cannot reach (6, 6) this turn, regardless of its move.\n*   My move is guaranteed safe and rewarding.\n\nAnalyzing S1's counter-moves:\n*   If S1 moves UP (to 7, 6): S1 is now where I was.\n*   If S1 moves LEFT (to 6, 5): S1 is positioned for the next apple at (1, 2) or (1, 0).\n*   If S1 moves DOWN/RIGHT: S1 moves away.\n\nThis is a clear local optimization. I must secure (6, 6) while it is available in one move.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (T5 onwards):**\n1. T4: Move LEFT (Eat (6, 6)). Score 2. Length 3. Head (6, 6). S1 likely moves to (7, 6) or (6, 5).\n2. T5: Apples remaining: (2, 8), (1, 0), (9, 4), (1, 2). Current position (6, 6). S1 at (7, 6) or (6, 5).\n    *   (9, 4) is 3 moves away ($|6-9| + |6-4| = 5$).\n    *   (2, 8) is 6 moves away.\n    *   (1, 2) is 9 moves away.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (7, 6) (if S1 vacated it), I position myself either towards (9, 4) or towards the middle of the board. If S1 moves to (7, 6), I should move DOWN to avoid an immediate confrontation on T5, perhaps aiming for the eastern apples (9, 4).\n\nThe immediate move is strongly LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Moves towards (2, 8) and (8, 8).\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 5):** **Collision Risk!** Snake #1 is currently at (6, 5). If I move DOWN and S1 stays put, it's a head-on collision (Kill both). If S1 moves away, it's safe. If S1 moves UP (to 6, 6), it's a head-on collision (Kill both). **Danger! Eliminate.**\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 6):** Safe. Moves toward western apples (1, 0) and (1, 2).\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** Safe. This is my previous head position (now the first body segment). My tail will move off (8, 6) if I don't grow, freeing up (8, 6) for T6. If I move RIGHT, I am adjacent to my body, but I do not hit the head-adjacent segment (7, 6) *unless* I move into the cell that (7, 6) is in, which is the definition of a safe move if I don't grow. I *will* not grow, so the tail will move off of (8, 6). Safe.\n\n*Safe Move Candidates: UP (6, 7), LEFT (5, 6), RIGHT (7, 6).*\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (at (6, 5)) Intentions:**\nS1 is length 1. S1 has 0 apples. S1 moved L on T4, positioning itself directly below me.\n\nPossible moves for S1 (from 6, 5):\n1. **UP (to 6, 6):** Targets my current head position (6, 6). This is a head-on collision if I stay put, or if I move somewhere else and S1 lands on the space I just vacated, it's safe for S1. **If I move anywhere, S1 can safely take (6, 6).**\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 4):** Moves toward the apple at (9, 4) or just away. Safe.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 5):** Moves towards western apples. Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 5):** Moves towards eastern/center board. Safe.\n\nS1 is currently positioned very aggressively, directly next to my previous move path. If I move DOWN, it's a fatal collision risk regardless of S1's move *unless* S1 moves R, L, or D (and my current self-move is D). Because S1 might move UP, I cannot move DOWN.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves (Prioritizing Apple Access):**\n\nApples remaining: (2, 8), (1, 0), (9, 4), (1, 2), (8, 8).\n\n*   **Move UP (6, 7):**\n    *   Distance to (8, 8): 3 moves (R, U).\n    *   Distance to (2, 8): 5 moves (L/U).\n    *   If S1 moves UP (6, 6), S1 is now in my starting spot.\n    *   This move takes me towards the northern apples, but away from S1. S1 will likely pivot to (6, 6) or move west/east.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 6):**\n    *   Distance to (1, 2): 8 moves.\n    *   Distance to (1, 0): 10 moves.\n    *   S1 will get (6, 6). This is also a valid direction.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 6):**\n    *   Distance to (9, 4): 3 moves (R, D).\n    *   Distance to (8, 8): 3 moves (U, R).\n    *   This move keeps me near my body (7, 6 is the former head/current body segment 1). S1 will likely move to (6, 6).\n    *   This path seems to open up access to the eastern apples (9, 4) and (8, 8) quickly, while keeping me one square away from S1's likely position (6, 6).\n\n**Comparing Strategic Outcomes:**\n\nI just secured two apples and have a length advantage (3 vs 1). S1 is competing aggressively for central space. If I try to defend (6, 6), I risk a collision if S1 tries to take it anyway. Since no apples are immediately adjacent, securing a better strategic position is key.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (7, 6)**:\n- New Head: (7, 6). Body [(8, 6), (8, 6) - *wait, (8, 6) is the end of the snake, (7, 6) *was* the head*. Head (6, 6), Body (7, 6), (8, 6). If I move R, new body is (7, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6) no wait. New head (7, 6). Body: (6, 6), (7, 6) [oops, (7, 6) is what I just moved into], (8, 6). The sequence is Head (7, 6), Body (6, 6), (7, 6) - which is an invalid setup unless the tail moved off (8, 6).\nLet's restate the body: If I move R to (7, 6):\nOld body: (7, 6), (8, 6).\nAfter move: Head (7, 6). Body segments move: (6, 6) becomes body 1, (7, 6) becomes body 2, (8, 6) is the tail, and since I didn't grow, the old tail cell (8, 6) is now empty.\nNew snake: (7, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6). **SELF COLLISION!** I cannot move into (7, 6) if (7, 6) is the location of the *second* segment in the new configuration.\n\nLet's retrace the body movement rule:\nCurrent: Head (6, 6), B1 (7, 6), B2 (8, 6).\nIf I move R to (7, 6).\nNew Head: (7, 6).\nOld Head (6, 6) becomes B1.\nOld B1 (7, 6) becomes B2.\nWait, if B1 is (7, 6), and I move R to (7, 6), I hit B1!\n\nLet's re-read the body coordinates section: *All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.*\n\nMy snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (6, 6)\n  - Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6)]\nThe connection is (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I move onto the cell occupied by (7, 6). This is the segment immediately following my head.\n**Moving into the cell occupied by the current segment B1 (7, 6) is always defined as hitting myself and dying, unless I am guaranteed to grow.** Since I won't grow on (7, 6), where there is no apple, **move RIGHT is fatal.**\n\n*Revisiting Safe Moves: UP (6, 7), LEFT (5, 6).*\n\n**4. Final Choice between UP and LEFT:**\n\n*   **Apple Distance Comparison:**\n    *   (2, 8) is 5 away from (6, 7) [4L, 1U].\n    *   (8, 8) is 3 away from (6, 7) [2R, 1U].\n    *   (9, 4) is 5 away from (6, 7) [3R, 3D].\n    *   (1, 2) is 9 away from (6, 7) [5L, 5D].\n\n    *   (2, 8) is 6 away from (5, 6) [3L, 2U].\n    *   (1, 0) is 10 away from (5, 6) [4L, 6D].\n    *   (9, 4) is 4 away from (5, 6) [4R, 2D].\n\nMoving UP seems slightly better positioned to grab (8, 8) or (2, 8). Moving LEFT leads toward the west, which is heavily populated by apples but far away. The priority target should be the nearest apple: (9, 4) is 4 moves from (6, 6). (8, 8) is 4 moves from (6, 6).\n\nIf I move UP (6, 7): I am 4 moves from (8, 8) (R, R, U). I am 7 moves from (9, 4).\nIf I move LEFT (5, 6): I am 4 moves from (9, 4) (R, R, R, D, D). Wait, that's 5 moves. (4R, 2D) = 6 moves. From (5, 6) to (9, 4) is 4R, 2D = 6 moves.\n\nLet's stick with the closest northern apple (8, 8).\nFrom (6, 6): Move UP is (6, 7). Then R, R, U to (8, 8). 3 moves total. Total path length 4.\nFrom (6, 6): Move UP (6, 7) seems optimal for safety (moves away from S1) and access to the northern apples.\n\n**Predicting S1's move (from 6, 5):**\nS1 will likely move UP to (6, 6) to secure the central position, or LEFT to (5, 5) to move away from me. If S1 moves UP, I lose the territory (6, 6). If I move UP to (6, 7), S1 safely takes that ground.\n\nIf I move UP:\nHead: (6, 7). S1 takes (6, 6).\nT6: I would likely move RIGHT to (7, 7) or DOWN to (6, 6 - collision S1?). Wait, if S1 is at (6, 6) on T6, I cannot move DOWN to (6, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nHead: (5, 6). S1 takes (6, 6).\nT6: I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT. S1 is safely separated.\n\nMoving LEFT gives me more options on T6 since S1 is now separated to the right of me. It allows a pivot toward the center if S1 leaves (6, 6) later, or a continued safe path towards the west.\n\nLet's analyze the safety and positioning tradeoff. Moving UP risks getting boxed in the top right corner if S1 moves up aggressively. Moving LEFT keeps me in a more central region of the board horizontally.\n\nI choose LEFT (5, 6). This is safe, and maintains distance from S1, who is highly likely to move to (6, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T6 onwards):**\nHead at (5, 6). S1 likely at (6, 6).\nThe nearest apple (9, 4) is 6 moves away, (8, 8) is 5 moves away.\nT6 strategy will be to move towards the center/west based on S1's move. If S1 stays central, I consolidate towards (2, 8) or (1, 2).\n\nLEFT",

Potential conflict on turn 7 if both stick to the grid edge (5, 4 vs 5, 5).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (4, 6):**\n    *   Distance to (2, 8): 1 move closer (remaining 4).\n    *   Distance to (8, 8): 1 move further (remaining 6).\n    *   Good for western targets like (2, 8), (1, 2).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nWe are well-positioned to attack the northern apples (2, 8) and (8, 8). Moving UP (5, 7) immediately closes the distance to both by one step. It also keeps my snake safely away from S1's current position and most likely moves (S1 is expected to move toward (9, 4) or the center).\n\nIf I move UP:\nNew Head: (5, 7).\nS1 likely moves RIGHT (7, 4) toward (9, 4) or UP (6, 5) to claim territory.\n\nIf S1 moves to (6, 5), I have a safe path to (8, 8) (R, R, U) starting from (5, 7).\nIf S1 moves to (7, 4), I can continue north or pivot east towards (8, 8).\n\nMoving UP provides the best short-term apple access and maintains safety.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T7 onwards):**\nHead at (5, 7). Focus on securing (8, 8) or (2, 8). Since S1 is isolated in the bottom-right, (8, 8) is potentially faster and less contested. Target (8, 8) next. (5, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 8).

RIGHT if we see an opening to (8, 8) (more likely as S1 is far south).\n\nSince both (2, 8) and (8, 8) are equally close and promising, advancing north is the most efficient spatial move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T8 onwards):**\nHead at (5, 8).

(9, 4) is the closest apple (Manhattan distance 5).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (from 6, 2):\n1. **UP (to 6, 3):** Moves toward (9, 4). (Distance 4 after move). Distance to my path is large.\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 1):** Moves away from most apples, unless targeting (1, 0).\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 2):** Moves toward (1, 2).\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 2):** Moves toward (9, 4).\n\nS1 is not an immediate threat to my position (5, 8).\n\n**3.

Both currently Distance 3.\n\n*   **Move UP (5, 9):**\n    *   New distance to (2, 8): 4 (1 step further).\n    *   New distance to (8, 8): 4 (1 step further).\n    *   This move takes me to the boundary wall, limiting future options (only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT remain). It also moves away from both target apples horizontally. **Least desirable primary option.**\n\n*   **Move LEFT (4, 8):**\n    *   New distance to (2, 8): 2 (1 step closer).\n    *   New distance to (8, 8): 4 (1 step further).\n    *   This commits me strongly towards the (2, 8) apple.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (6, 8):**\n    *   New distance to (2, 8): 4 (1 step further).\n    *   New distance to (8, 8): 2 (1 step closer).\n    *   This commits me strongly towards the (8, 8) apple.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nSince both (2, 8) and (8, 8) are equally available, I should choose one and commit to it to ensure a capture before moving down the board.\n\nThe (8, 8) apple is on the right side, closer to the corner. The (2, 8) apple is closer to the center of the left wall. Given that S1 is currently biased toward the bottom right (6, 2), if S1 were to advance up the right side (7, 3, 8, 4, 9, 4), they might challenge (8, 8) in the long term, but they have to travel 6+ steps to reach that altitude.\n\nLet's commit to **RIGHT** (6, 8), targeting (8, 8). This keeps me in a less cramped space than the left wall (where I would be boxed in by the (2, 8) capture). Moving to (6, 8) positions me well for the next move to (7, 8) or (8, 8).\n\nLong-Term Plan (T9 onwards):\nMove RIGHT (6, 8). Target (8, 8). Future steps will likely involve moving RIGHT to (7, 8) or (8, 8) to secure the apple. After securing (8, 8), I will rotate and head down/left to pursue the central or bottom apples, potentially (9, 4) if S1 doesn't claim it.\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (at (7, 2)) Position and Intent:**\nS1 is likely going for A3 (9, 4) (distance 4) or A4 (1, 2) (distance 6).\nGiven S1 is at (7, 2), moving UP to (7, 3), RIGHT to (8, 2), or even LEFT to (6, 2) are possibilities. Targeting A3 (9, 4) usually involves RIGHT or UP moves.\n\nIf S1 moves:\n*   (8, 2): Distance to A3 (9, 4) is 3.\n*   (7, 3): Distance to A3 (9, 4) is 3.\n\nS1 is in a very strong position for A3. I need to move aggressively towards A3, or immediately switch to A1 (2, 8).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Apple Goals:**\n\n**Target A3 (9, 4):**\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Distance to A3: |9-9| + |8-4| = 4. This shortens my path to A3 from 5 to 4, matching S1's current path length (assuming S1 moves optimally). This is a strong move.\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** Distance to A3: |8-9| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Also good, starts moving vertically down.\n*   **UP (8, 9):** Distance to A3: |8-9| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6. Moves away.\n\n**Target A1 (2, 8):**\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Distance to A1: |9-2| + |8-8| = 7. (Worse)\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** Distance to A1: 6+1=7. (Worse)\n*   **UP (8, 9):** Distance to A1: 6+1=7. (Worse)\n\nCurrently, targeting A3 (9, 4) gives the best immediate gain, even if it is contested. Both RIGHT (9, 8) and DOWN (8, 7) are viable.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT vs DOWN for A3:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 8):** Puts me on the border, 4 moves away. My path is (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). This locks me onto the right wall.\n*   **DOWN (8, 7):** Puts me one step into the map, 4 moves away. My path is (8, 7) (down) -> (8, 6) (down) -> (8, 5) (down) -> (9, 5) (right) -> (9, 4) (down). Wait, this path is 5 steps: (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (9, 4). Oh, (9, 4) is 4 steps away: (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) (5 steps). Wait, Manhattan distance 4 means 4 moves. (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). (5 steps).\nLet's verify Manhattan Distances translating to exact moves:\nFrom (8, 8):\nA3 (9, 4). |8-9|=1, |8-4|=4. Total 5 moves.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8). M.D. to A3 is 4. (9, 8) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). 4 moves.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7). M.D. to A3 is 4. (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). 4 moves.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN lead to equal travel time toward A3 (9, 4).\n\n**Strategic preference:**\nMoving RIGHT (9, 8) keeps me further from S1's current position (7, 2) and potential upward/leftward movement. It also aligns me squarely on the fastest path along the right wall.\nMoving DOWN (8, 7) is slightly more central and flexible, allowing a pivot back towards mid-board apples like (3, 4) or further left to (2, 8).\n\nSince A3 is highly contested, flexibility is valuable. If S1 takes A3, I need to pivot quickly back left to A1 (2, 8).\n\nLet's check A1 (2, 8) path lengths:\nFrom (8, 8), M.D. is 6.\nIf I move RIGHT (9, 8). M.D. to A1 (2, 8) is 7.\nIf I move DOWN (8, 7). M.D. to A1 (2, 8) is 7.\nIf I move UP (8, 9). M.D. to A1 (2, 8) is 7.\n\nOkay, all safe moves increase distance to A1, but only marginally.\n\nGiven the distance equality to A3, I will choose **DOWN (8, 7)**. This provides better flexibility if S1 intercepts A3, as I will already be positioned lower to cross the board towards A5 (3, 4) or A4 (1, 2) later, and I can easily move LEFT (7, 7) or DOWN (8, 6) on the next turn.\n\n**4. Collision Check:**\nMy move: (8, 8) -> (8, 7).\nS1 is at (7, 2). S1 is unlikely to move higher than (7, 3) or right than (8, 2) this turn. No head-on collision risk with (8, 7).\n\n**Summary:** Move DOWN to (8, 7) to start the descent towards A3 (9, 4) while maintaining maximum flexibility for a pivot to A1 (2, 8) should S1 claim A3.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for T12 onwards:**\nHead at (8, 7). S1 is likely heading towards (9, 4).\nIf A3 (9, 4) is still available on T12, continue pressing towards it (e.g., RIGHT to (9, 7) OR DOWN to (8, 6)).\nIf A3 is taken, re-evaluate, pivoting towards A1 (2, 8) by moving LEFT or DOWN/LEFT.\n\nDOWN",

S1 is likely moving towards A3 (9, 4) or perhaps A4 (1, 2).\nIf S1 targets A3, optimal moves are UP (7, 2) or RIGHT (8, 1).\n*   If S1 moves UP to (7, 2), it is far from my resulting position (8, 6) or (9, 7).\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 1), it is far from my resulting position.\n\nThere is no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**4. Compare DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 7):** Places me on the right wall. Path: (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). This locks me into a very clean, right-side approach.\n*   **DOWN (8, 6):** Places me one square inward. Path: (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4). (Wait, (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (9, 4). 3 moves. Yes, 3 moves). This path requires a horizontal move later, potentially crossing more open space.\n\nSince A3 (9, 4) is now marginally non-contested (I'm 4 moves away, S1 is 5 moves away), I should choose the safest and most direct line. The right wall provides a secure corridor that minimizes central traffic.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT (9, 7)** sets me up for a smooth descent along the board edge, minimizing interaction with S1 who is still low and left.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for T13 onwards:**\nIf (9, 4) is still available, continue descending (DOWN from 9, 7). We are three moves away if S1 doesn't intercept or move extremely aggressively. If A3 is taken, re-evaluate target, likely switching focus to A1 (2, 8) or A5 (3, 4).\n\nRIGHT",

Next move needed: DOWN.\n*   M.D. to A4 (3, 4) becomes 6.\n*   Keeps my snake along the wall, which restricts movement but isolates S1.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 3), S1 is closer to A5.\n\nComparing LEFT and DOWN: Both put me 2 steps away from A5 (8, 2).\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (8, 4): I am now adjacent to my own body part (8, 7) three steps away.

If I move DOWN to (9, 2), I am 1 move away from A5.\n\nLet's prioritize the capture of A5 and avoiding S1. S1 is at (7, 3).\n\nIf I move **DOWN (9, 3)**:\nS1 optimal move for A5 (8, 2) is RIGHT to (8, 3) (M.D. 1 to A5).\nIf S1 goes (8, 3) and I go (9, 3), then next turn:\nI can go DOWN to (9, 2). S1 can go DOWN to (8, 2) (EAT) or LEFT/RIGHT/UP.\nS1 is likely to eat A5 this way.\n\nIf I move **LEFT (8, 4)**:\nS1 optimal move for A5 (8, 2) is RIGHT to (8, 3) (M.D. 1 to A5).\nIf S1 goes (8, 3) and I go (8, 4), then next turn:\nI can go DOWN to (8, 3). **Head-on collision or S1 body collision!** If S1 stays at (8, 3) (maybe moving into a wall, or into its own future body), I might hit it. But S1 just moved to (8, 3). If S1 moves *onto* A5 (8, 2), then the cell (8, 3) becomes available.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the race for A5 (8, 2).\nMe (9, 4): MD 3.\nS1 (7, 3): MD 2.\n\nT16:\nI move LEFT to (8, 4). MD 2.\nS1 might move RIGHT to (8, 3). MD 1.\nT17:\nI move DOWN to (8, 3).\nS1 moves DOWN to (8, 2) (EATS A5).\nResult: S1 gets the apple. I am at (8, 3).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 3). MD 2.\nS1 moves RIGHT to (8, 3). MD 1.\nT17:\nI move DOWN to (9, 2).\nS1 moves DOWN to (8, 2) (EATS A5).\nResult: S1 gets the apple. I am at (9, 2).\n\nIn both safe scenarios (LEFT or DOWN), it appears S1 will beat me to A5 because they are already 1 move closer (7, 3) vs (9, 4) and A5 is at (8, 2).\n\nSince A5 is likely lost, I must choose the move that sets me up better for the next closest apple, A4 (3, 4), and maintains maximum future mobility.\n\nDistance to A4 (3, 4):\nFrom (9, 4), MD is 6.\n\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 4). New MD to A4: 5. This is the optimal reduction in distance towards A4, which is on the same Y-axis.\n2. Move DOWN to (9, 3). New MD to A4: 6. No reduction in distance.\n\nTherefore, moving **LEFT (8, 4)** is superior for the long-term goal of reaching A4 (3, 4). It also successfully pulls my snake head away from the long vertical segment of my body along X=9, which is crucial for safety.\n\nWe must check for collision risk if S1 moves to (8, 4). S1 is at (7, 3). S1 can move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.\nS1 to (8, 3) (RIGHT, 1 step closer to A5) - Safe.\nS1 to (7, 4) (UP, 1 step closer to A4/A1) - Safe.\nS1 to (6, 3) (LEFT) - Safe.\nS1 to (7, 2) (DOWN) - Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 4), there is no immediate head-on collision with S1.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note for T17 onwards:**\nAssume S1 takes A5 (8, 2). Goal is now A4 (3, 4) (MD 5 from (8, 4)). Since I am at (8, 4), the path is LEFT repeated towards X=3. The body segment (8, 7) is nearby, but moving along Y=4 keeps me safe from my vertical body segments at X=9. I should continue moving LEFT until I reach (3, 4). I must watch out for S1 crossing my path.\n\nLEFT",

A4 (3, 4): |8-3| + |4-4| = 5. (Target)\n2. A5 (8, 2): |8-8| + |4-2| = 2. (Closest, but potentially risky near S1's previous location)\n3. A1 (2, 8): |8-2| + |4-8| = 6 + 4 = 10.\n4. A3 (1, 2): |8-1| + |4-2| = 7 + 2 = 9.\n5. A2 (1, 0): |8-1| + |4-0| = 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nA5 (8, 2) is now 2 steps away. A4 (3, 4) is 5 steps away.\n\n**S1's Position and Intent:**\nS1 is at (7, 4). My head is (8, 4). We are adjacent horizontally. This is dangerous.\n\nS1's distance to A5 (8, 2): |7-8| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nS1's distance to A4 (3, 4): |7-3| + |4-4| = 4.\n\nI have a competitive advantage for A5 (2 steps vs 3 steps for S1).\nI have a competitive advantage for A4 (5 steps vs 4 steps for S1, wait S1 is 4 steps away). S1 is closer to A4.\n\nSince S1 is adjacent to me at (7, 4), and my current position (8, 4) is perfectly aligned with A4 (3, 4), a defensive move towards A4 while maintaining safety is key.\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves from (8, 4):**\n\n*   My occupied body locations: (9, 4) (B1), (9, 5) (B2), (9, 6) (B3), (9, 7) (B4).\n*   S1 Head: (7, 4).\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 5):** Safe from my body. M.D. to A5 (8, 2) increases to 3. M.D. to A4 (3, 4) increases to 6. This move is generally bad for reaching targets, but safe from S1 collision.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), S1 hits me. **FATAL MOVE IF S1 MOVES RIGHT!**\n\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 3):** Safe from my body. M.D. to A5 (8, 2) is 1. Excellent for A5.\n    *   S1 at (7, 4). If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), S1 hits my head. **FATAL MOVE IF S1 MOVES RIGHT!**\n    *   If S1 moves DOWN to (7, 3), safe.\n    *   If S1 moves UP to (7, 5), safe.\n    *   If S1 moves LEFT to (6, 4), safe.\n\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 4):** Collision Risk! Moving into S1 head position. **FATAL MOVE (Head-on or mutual suicide if S1 moves LEFT too)!**\n    *   We are at (8, 4) and (7, 4). If I move LEFT, I enter (7, 4). If S1 stays, I hit S1. If S1 moves somewhere else, I occupy (7, 4). If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), we have a head-on collision.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 4):** Collision Risk! Moving into B1 (9, 4). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.** (Moving backwards)\n\nWait, I need to check the collision rules carefully when adjacent.\n\nMy Head: (8, 4). S1 Head: (7, 4).\n\nIf I move:\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):**\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), S1 moves into my previous location. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), S1 moves into my previous location. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):**\n    *   If S1 moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, I move into S1's occupied cell (7, 4) and S1 simultaneously leaves it. Safe for me, but S1 gets the space.\n    *   *If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4):* This is a head-on collision. Both die. **EXTREMELY RISKY, AVOID.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** Hits my body. Fatal.\n\n**Re-evaluating Collision Check for Adjacent Heads:**\nIf I move to U, and S1 moves to V, we collide if U=V (Head-on) or if U is S1's body/tail, or V is my body/tail. Since S1 is length 1, and I am length 5, no body collision risk exists yet.\n\nThe only way I can die by S1 hitting me is if I move into the cell S1 just occupied and S1's move was RIGHT (to 8, 4), which is my current cell. Wait, no. If I move to (8, 5) [UP], and S1 moves to (8, 4) [RIGHT], S1 occupies the cell I *just left*. This is perfectly safe for both of us.\n\nLet's re-examine LEFT move:\nI move LEFT (8, 4) -> (7, 4).\nS1 moves RIGHT (7, 4) -> (8, 4).\nThis is a fatal head-on collision (U=V where U is occupied by my head and V is occupied by S1's head). **FATAL.**\n\nSo, I cannot move LEFT.\nMy only safe moves against S1 moving RIGHT are UP or DOWN, as these directions move vertically away from S1.\n\n*Safe Move Candidates: UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3).*\n\n**2. Analyze Optimal Move (UP vs DOWN):**\n\n**Option A: DOWN (to 8, 3)**\n*   M.D. to A5 (8, 2) is 1. Path: (8, 3) -> (8, 2) (EAT).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (6, 4) or UP to (7, 5) or DOWN to (7, 3), I am safe and primed to eat A5 next turn.\n*   The risk is low as S1 moving RIGHT (8, 4) is non-fatal for me (it moves into my just-vacated spot).\n*   This is the fastest path to the closest apple A5.\n\n**Option B: UP (to 8, 5)**\n*   M.D. to A5 (8, 2) is 3.\n*   M.D. to A4 (3, 4) is 6.\n*   This move takes me further away from both primary targets (A4 & A5). It keeps me safe but is inefficient.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (8, 3) secures the closest apple (A5 (8, 2)) in the next turn, regardless of S1's movement, as long as A5 is still there. Since S1 is 3 steps away from A5, S1 cannot steal A5 this turn or next turn even if S1 moves optimally towards it (e.g., S1 moves DOWN to 7, 3, then RIGHT/DOWN/etc.).\n\nLet's confirm the path to A5 (8, 2) if I move DOWN:\nT17: I move DOWN to (8, 3).\nT18: I move DOWN to (8, 2). I eat A5.\n\nS1 moves towards A5:\nT17: S1 moves DOWN to (7, 3).\nT18: S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 3). S1 runs into my previous segment (8, 3) if I eat and grow, meaning my tail doesn't follow. However, if I eat, my body stays at (8, 3). If S1 moves into my *new* body segment (8, 3), S1 dies. This is good!\n\nT17: S1 moves towards A4 (3, 4).\nS1 moves LEFT to (6, 4).\nT18: I eat A5. S1 continues towards A4. Good setup.\n\nT17: S1 moves UP to (7, 5) (or RIGHT to (8, 4)). Since S1 moving RIGHT is safe for me, it is a non-issue. S1 moves away from A5.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best tactical move to secure an apple and possibly trap S1 later if they chase.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary:**\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 3) to set up A5 consumption on T18.\n2. After consuming A5, my head is at (8, 2). The next primary target is A4 (3, 4) (MD: 5).\n3. Continue moving LEFT to maximize movement toward A4 while monitoring S1's position.\n\nDOWN",

Select Optimal Move:**\n\nThe goal is immediate apple consumption at A5 (8, 2).\n\nMove **DOWN** to (8, 2) is the only logical choice:\n1. It guarantees an apple (A5).\n2. It's safe against S1. Even if S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 3), S1 merely occupies the cell I just left, and since I eat, my body segment (8, 3) will remain, potentially trapping S1 next turn if S1 tries to move into it.\n\nLet's confirm the potential trap:\nT18: I move DOWN to (8, 2) and eat A5. My new body is [(8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]. Length 6.\nScenario 1: S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 3). S1 is now adjacent to my new head (8, 2) and adjacent to my body segment (8, 4). S1 is essentially squeezed by my snake.\nScenario 2: S1 moves DOWN to (7, 2). S1 is still 1 step away from A5 (8, 2), but A5 is gone.\n\nIn both cases, DOWN is the best move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Post-Apple A5):**\nMy head will be at (8, 2). Length 6.\nThe next closest target is A4 (3, 4) - MD: 5.\nI should start moving efficiently towards A4 (LEFT and UP). Since S1 is likely now at (8, 3) or (7, 2), I need to be careful about S1 blocking my path or chasing me. Since my snake is long, I can use the length defensively. I will primarily move LEFT towards the center column (x=4 or x=3) to grab A4.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safe Moves from (8, 2):**\n\n*   My occupied body/head locations: (8, 2) (H), (8, 3) (B1), (8, 4) (B2), (9, 4) (B3), (9, 5) (B4), (9, 6) (B5).\n*   S1 Head: (7, 2).\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 3):** Collision with B1 (8, 3). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.**\n\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 1):** Safe. Moves away from apples. Inefficient.\n\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 2):** Collision Risk! Moving into S1 head position. Head-on collision results in both dying. Must be eliminated unless S1's move is 100% predictable, which it is not. **FATAL RISK! Eliminate.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 2):** Apple A5 at (9, 2). Safe from my body. This is the optimal move to acquire an apple.\n    *   S1 at (7, 2).\n    *   S1's potential moves: UP (7, 3), DOWN (7, 1), LEFT (6, 2), RIGHT (8, 2).\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 2), S1 moves into my previous head location. This is safe for S1, and I successfully eat the apple.\n\n**2. Select Optimal Move:**\n\nThe immediate goal is to consume the apple at (9, 2), which is 1 step away.\n\nMove **RIGHT** to (9, 2) is the only logical choice:\n1. It guarantees an apple (A5) and increases my lead to 6-0.\n2. It's safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Post-Apple A5):**\nMy head will be at (9, 2). Length 7.\nS1 will be forced to look for targets on the left side of the board (A3 at (1, 2) or A4 at (3, 4)).\n\nAfter consuming (9, 2), my snake is confined to the right edge (x=8 and x=9) of the board near the bottom. To reach the next targets (A3 at (1, 2) or A4 at (3, 4)), I need to traverse the board horizontally.\n\nMy body blocks (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6).\nNew Head (H): (9, 2). New B1: (8, 2). New B2: (8, 3).\n\nI should prioritize moving LEFT immediately to start crossing the board, probably targeting (9, 1) or (9, 3) first, then moving towards x=4. Given my current position on the wall, I should move DOWN to (9, 1) or UP to (9, 3) to clear the traffic area, and then move LEFT. (9, 3) seems slightly better as it is closer to the center of the grid, but I must check safety.\n\nNext turn (T20) analysis (Assuming I move RIGHT now):\nNew Head: (9, 2). My tail (temporarily) remains at (9, 6).\nSafe moves from (9, 2):\n1. UP (9, 3): Safe.\n2. DOWN (9, 1): Safe.\n3. LEFT (8, 2): Collision with B1. **FATAL.**\n\nSo after eating, I must move UP or DOWN. Since A4 (3, 4) and A3 (1, 2) are targets, moving UP towards (9, 3) seems slightly better positioned for a horizontal sweep across the middle (y=3 or y=4).\n\nCurrent decision is RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

Length 7 (since the snake grows after eating).\nBody: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]. Apple count: 6.\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1) Head is at (6, 2). S1 likely moved LEFT from (7, 2). S1 length 1. Apple count: 0.\n\nBoard size: 10x10.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (2, 8)\nA2: (1, 0)\nA3: (1, 2)\nA4: (3, 4)\nA5: (4, 4)\n\nCurrent Apples and Manhattan Distance (MD) from my Head (9, 2):\n1. A3 (1, 2): |9-1| + |2-2| = 8 + 0 = 8 (Straight across bottom).\n2. A4 (3, 4): |9-3| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n3. A5 (4, 4): |9-4| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7. (Closest for now)\n4. A2 (1, 0): |9-1| + |2-0| = 8 + 2 = 10.\n5. A1 (2, 8): |9-2| + |2-8| = 7 + 6 = 13.\n\nThe goal is to move across the board towards the cluster of apples (A4, A5) or the straight shot at A3. Since A5 (4, 4) is closest and S1 is far away on the left side, I need to start moving LEFT.\n\n**S1's Position and Intent:**\nS1 is at (6, 2), looking for food. S1 is currently closer to A3 (1, 2) (MD=5) and A4 (3, 4) (MD=3) than I am (MD=8 for both).\nS1's MD to A5 (4, 4) is 4. My MD is 7.\n\nS1 will likely pursue A4 or A5, or possibly A3 (the path is blocked by my former body segment at (8, 2) (now 9, 2) if it were a direct shot, but since I moved right, (8, 2) is now my body segment $B_1$).\n\nSince my snake ate the apple, my entire body shifts. Current Body: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6).\n\n**1. Evaluate Safe Moves from (9, 2):**\n\n*   My occupied body/head locations: (9, 2) (H), (8, 2) (B1), (8, 3) (B2), (8, 4) (B3), (9, 4) (B4), (9, 5) (B5), (9, 6) (B6).\n*   S1 Head: (6, 2).\n\n*   **UP (to 9, 3):** Safe. Keeps me along the wall. Good maneuvering toward the center.\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 1):** Safe. Keeps me along the wall.\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 2):** Collision with B1 (8, 2). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.**\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 2):** Off the board (x=10). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.**\n\nOnly UP and DOWN are safe immediate moves. I need to move LEFT overall.\n\n**2. Choosing between UP and DOWN:**\n\nMoving towards the center of the board (y=4 or y=5) is generally better for navigation and reaching central targets (A4, A5 at y=4).\n\n*   **Move UP (to 9, 3):**\n    *   Next potential moves (T21) from (9, 3): RIGHT (off grid/wall), UP (9, 4) [BLOCK, B4], DOWN (9, 2) [Backwards], LEFT (8, 3) [BLOCK, B2].\n    *   Wait, let's re-examine body blockages carefully for T21:\n        *   New Head (H): (9, 3).\n        *   New Body: (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5). Tail releases (9, 6).\n        *   From (9, 3):\n            *   UP (9, 4): Collision with B5 (9, 4). **FATAL.**\n            *   DOWN (9, 2): Backwards move. **FATAL.**\n            *   LEFT (8, 3): Collision with B3 (8, 3). **FATAL.**\n            *   RIGHT (10, 3): Off board. **FATAL.**\n    *   **If I move UP, I will trap myself and die on T21!** This is a critical realization. (The body segment (9, 4) is 2 moves away right now, but (8, 3) is 1 move away). T21 analysis based on UP move: (9, 3) is surrounded by my body (9, 4) UP, (8, 3) LEFT, and the wall/backwards movement.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 9, 1):**\n    *   Keeps the path clear along the bottom edge for a horizontal traversal.\n    *   Next potential moves (T21) from (9, 1):\n        *   New Head (H): (9, 1).\n        *   New Body: (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5). Tail releases (9, 6).\n        *   From (9, 1):\n            *   UP (9, 2): Collision with B1 (9, 2). **FATAL.**\n            *   DOWN (9, 0): Safe.\n            *   LEFT (8, 1): Safe. (Opens path to A3 (1, 2) / A2 (1, 0)).\n            *   RIGHT (10, 1): Off board. **FATAL.**\n    *   If I move DOWN, I have two safe follow-up moves: DOWN to (9, 0) or LEFT to (8, 1). Moving LEFT is the strategic choice to start chasing apples. This guarantees survival for T21.\n\n**S1 Evasion Check:**\nS1 is at (6, 2). S1 can move UP (6, 3), DOWN (6, 1), LEFT (5, 2), or RIGHT (7, 2).\nS1 is focused on the central/left apples. My move won't directly interfere with S1, but moving DOWN clears the way for a long horizontal traversal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (9, 3) leads to an immediate trap and death on T21.\nMoving DOWN to (9, 1) provides safe options (DOWN or LEFT) on T21, allowing me to start working my way towards the remaining apples on the left side of the board.\n\nTherefore, the only safe and strategic move is DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary:**\n1. Move DOWN to (9, 1).\n2. T21: Move LEFT to (8, 1) to begin horizontal sweep.\n3. Continue moving LEFT along the bottom edge (y=1 or y=0) aiming for A3 (1, 2) or A2 (1, 0).\n4. Monitor S1's progress. If S1 is distracted, turn UP toward A4/A5 on the way.\n\nDOWN",

A2 (1, 0): |9-1| + |1-0| = 8 + 1 = 9. (Closest on the bottom row)\n2. A3 (1, 2): |9-1| + |1-2| = 8 + 1 = 9.\n3. A4 (3, 4): |9-3| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n4. A5 (4, 4): |9-4| + |1-4| = 5 + 3 = 8. (Technically closest, but requires upward movement deep into my body structure).\n5. A1 (2, 8): |9-2| + |1-8| = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**S1's Position and Intent:**\nS1 is at (6, 3). S1 is now closest to A4 (3, 4) (MD=3) and A5 (4, 4) (MD=3). S1 is likely heading for one of those central apples, or perhaps A3 (1, 2) (MD=5). My snake is currently far from S1 and not in danger of immediate conflict.\n\n**1.

Eliminate.** (Moving backwards)\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 0):** Safe. Moves toward A2 (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT (to 8, 1):** Safe. Strategic move to start horizontal traversal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 1):** Off the board. **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.**\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**2. Comparing DOWN and LEFT:**\n\nBoth moves allow me to make progress towards the left side of the board.\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (to 8, 1):**\n    *   This is the most direct way to start moving towards the cluster of apples (A2/A3/A4/A5).\n    *   T22 options from (8, 1): UP (to 8, 2) [Collision with B2: (8, 2)], DOWN (to 8, 0) [Safe, continues traversal], LEFT (to 7, 1) [Safe, continues traversal], RIGHT (to 9, 1) [Backwards, B1].\n    *   If I move LEFT now, I have safe options DOWN or LEFT next turn. This is good.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (to 9, 0):**\n    *   This positions me on the bottom wall, potentially simplifying future movement, and puts me 8 MD away from A2 (1, 0).\n    *   T22 options from (9, 0): UP (to 9, 1) [Backwards, B1], DOWN (to 9, -1) [Off board], LEFT (to 8, 0) [Safe, continues traversal], RIGHT (to 10, 0) [Off board].\n    *   If I move DOWN now, I must move LEFT next (to 8, 0). This is a safe sequence, but forces me onto the very bottom edge.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move:**\nMoving LEFT (to 8, 1) keeps me off the absolute edge and closer to the central apples (A4, A5) if S1 misses them, while still providing a clear path to A2 and A3. It allows me to maintain a slightly higher y-coordinate, which generally offers more maneuverability than the y=0 boundary. Both options guarantee survival and continuous progress. LEFT is slightly more flexible because it doesn't force me onto the boundary.\n\nI will move LEFT to (8, 1), guaranteeing two safe consecutive moves (LEFT then LEFT or LEFT then DOWN).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Next few turns):**\n1. Move LEFT (to 8, 1).\n2. T22: Continue LEFT (to 7, 1) or perhaps DOWN (8, 0). Aim to stay around y=1 or y=2 while moving towards A3 (1, 2) or A2 (1, 0). The primary goal is horizontal progression.\n3. Monitor S1 (currently (6, 3)) and see if they claim A4 or A5.\n\nLEFT",

The last segment that will be released next turn is (9, 4).)\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1) Head: (6, 4). Length 1. Apples: 0. S1 moved UP from (6, 3) (based on the previous turn's state and the current position).\n\nBoard size: 10x10.

Monitor S1's progress on A4/A5.\n\n**Target Evaluation (Manhattan Distance from H: (8, 1)):**\n1. A2 (1, 0): |8-1| + |1-0| = 7 + 1 = 8.\n2. A3 (1, 2): |8-1| + |1-2| = 7 + 1 = 8.\n3.

A1 (2, 8): |8-2| + |1-8| = 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nCurrently, A5 is the closest, but it requires moving into the upper part of the board where my snake is relatively long and coiled, and S1 is positioned nearby. The path to A2/A3 is clearer and seems safer for continued horizontal progress.\n\n**S1's Position and Intent:**\nS1 is at (6, 4).\n* MD to A4 (3, 4): 3.\n* MD to A5 (4, 4): 2.\nS1 is now very effectively positioned to take A5 or A4. I will assume S1 will take one of those, making my long journey towards them less urgent. I should focus on A2/A3.\n\n**1.

S1 is essentially a point right now.\n\n*   **UP (to 8, 2):** Collision with B3 (8, 2). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.**\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 0):** Safe.

Eliminate.** (Moving backwards)\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**2. Comparing DOWN and LEFT:**\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (to 7, 1):**\n    *   Maintains my current y-level (y=1). Good for accessing A2 (1, 0) or A3 (1, 2).\n    *   T23 options from (7, 1): UP (7, 2) [Safe], DOWN (7, 0) [Safe], LEFT (6, 1) [Safe]. Excellent flexibility.\n    *   This choice keeps me moving away from the crowded area where S1 is operating.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (to 8, 0):**\n    *   Positions me on the bottom wall (y=0). This is slightly closer to A2 (8 MD -> 7 MD from (7, 0) next turn).\n    *   T23 options from (8, 0): UP (8, 1) [Backwards], DOWN (8, -1) [Off board], LEFT (7, 0) [Safe], RIGHT (9, 0) [Safe]. Good flexibility, though constrained by the boundary.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 1) provides slightly greater vertical movement flexibility next turn (can move up or down) compared to moving DOWN to (8, 0), which makes moving down impossible and moving up immediately is backwards. Since both get me closer to A2/A3, the move with higher positional flexibility is preferred.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Next few turns):**\nContinue moving LEFT towards x=1. Once around x=3 or x=2, decide whether to move down for A2 (1, 0) or up for A3 (1, 2). Since A3 is higher (y=2), it provides more space for maneuvers than A2 (y=0).\n\nLEFT",

I moved LEFT to (7, 1). The previous head (8, 1) is now the first body segment. The old tail (9, 4) should have been released if I didn't eat an apple. I did not eat an apple as stated in the previous rationale. However, the current body list given in the prompt is: `(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)`. This confirms my length is 7 (1 head + 6 body segments). The segment that will be released next turn is (8, 4).)\n\nEnemy Snake #1 (S1) Head: (6, 3). Length 1. Apples: 0.\n\nBoard size: 10x10.\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (2, 8)\nA2: (1, 0)\nA3: (1, 2)\nA4: (3, 4)\nA5: (4, 4)\n\n**Goal:** Continue moving left towards A2 (1, 0) and A3 (1, 2), as the central apples A4/A5 are still closer to S1 or require navigating a congested area.\n\n**Target Evaluation (Manhattan Distance from H: (7, 1)):**\n1. A2 (1, 0): |7-1| + |1-0| = 6 + 1 = 7. (Closest left side)\n2. A3 (1, 2): |7-1| + |1-2| = 6 + 1 = 7. (Closest left side)\n3. A4 (3, 4): |7-3| + |1-4| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n4. A5 (4, 4): |7-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6. (Absolute closest)\n5. A1 (2, 8): 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nNow A5 is the closest at MD 6. A4, A2, and A3 are all MD 7.\n\n**S1's Position and Intent:**\nS1 is at (6, 3).\n* MD to A4 (3, 4): |6-3| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n* MD to A5 (4, 4): |6-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nS1 is overwhelmingly focused on A5 (4, 4) or A4 (3, 4). S1 can reach A5 in 3 moves or A4 in 4 moves if moving directly. S1 will likely move towards (6, 4) or (5, 3) or (5, 4).\n\nIf I try to go for A5, I risk collision or entrapment. Given my current path (horizontal progress towards the left-side fruits), I should stick to A2/A3, which are less contested and offer clearer routes.\n\n**1. Evaluate Immediate Safe Moves from (7, 1):**\n\n*   My occupied body/head locations: (7, 1) (H), (8, 1) (B1), (9, 1) (B2), (9, 2) (B3), (8, 2) (B4), (8, 3) (B5), (8, 4) (Tail, releases)\n*   S1 Head/Body: (6, 3).\n\n*   **UP (to 7, 2):** Safe. Moves toward A3 (1, 2) slightly.\n*   **DOWN (to 7, 0):** Safe. Moves toward A2 (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT (to 6, 1):** Safe. Continues horizontal traversal toward A2/A3.\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 1):** Collision with B1 (8, 1). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.** (Moving backwards)\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (to 6, 1):**\n    *   This is the most direct path towards A2/A3. MD decreases from 7 to 6.\n    *   Keeps flexibility (UP to 6, 2 or DOWN to 6, 0 possible next turn).\n    *   (6, 1) is not immediately threatened by S1 (S1 is at (6, 3)). S1 is unlikely to move to (6, 2) then (6, 1) in two turns as it is chasing higher apples. S1's priority is (4, 4) or (3, 4).\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (to 7, 0):**\n    *   Moves towards A2 (1, 0). MD decreases from 7 to 6.\n    *   Constrains future movement vertically (can only move UP next turn).\n\n*   **Option C: Move UP (to 7, 2):**\n    *   Moves towards A3 (1, 2). MD is maintained at 7 (since (1, 2) is A3). No, MD decreases: 6 + |2-1| = 7. New H (7, 2). MD to A3 is |7-1| + |2-2| = 6. MD decreases from 7 to 6.\n    *   Provides high vertical freedom.\n\nAll three safe moves decrease the Manhattan Distance to the nearest desired apple (A2, A3).\n\nComparing (6, 1) and (7, 2):\n(6, 1) is one step further left. (7, 2) is one step further up. Both are MD 6 to their respective apples (A2 or A3).\n(6, 1) keeps me closer to the center of the board's width, which generally offers more options. However, being low at y=1 or y=2 is already limiting compared to the central y=4-6 area.\n\nSince I am trying to clear the left side, continuing the horizontal path is generally simplest and avoids moving toward the middle area where S1 is currently located. Moving LEFT to (6, 1) is consistent and efficient.\n\n**Checking for Head-on Collisions:**\nI move to (6, 1).\nS1 is at (6, 3).\nS1's safe moves:\n1. UP (6, 4): Towards A5. Safe from me.\n2. DOWN (6, 2): Towards me, but 1 cell away. Safe from collision this turn.\n3. LEFT (5, 3): Towards A4/A5. Safe from me.\n4. RIGHT (7, 3): Away from apples. Safe from me.\nThere is no risk of immediate head-on collision at (6, 1).\n\n**Decision:** The path LEFT (to 6, 1) is the most direct continuation of my current strategy toward the left-side apples, maintaining flexibility without moving into the relative congestion of the middle board where S1 is concentrated.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Next few turns):**\nContinue moving LEFT along y=1/y=2 depending on which apple (A2 or A3) becomes easier to reach. If I move to (6, 1), my likely next move will be LEFT (5, 1) or UP (6, 2) towards A3 (1, 2) for maximum open space. If S1 is preoccupied with A4/A5, I should have a clear run.\n\nLEFT",

Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (to 5, 1):**\n    *   This is the fastest progress towards A2/A3. MD 5 to both.\n    *   Keeps me on the bottom/edge, minimizing contact with S1.\n    *   Next turn, I have options: LEFT (4, 1), UP (5, 2), or DOWN (5, 0). Good flexibility.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (to 6, 0):**\n    *   MD to A2 is 5 + 0 = 5. MD to A3 is 5 + 2 = 7. Favors A2.\n    *   This puts me on the bottom edge (Y=0). If I move L/L/L/L, I hit A2. If I go LEFT now, I have more options next turn than if I go DOWN.\n\n*   **Option C: Move UP (to 6, 2):**\n    *   MD to A3 is 5 + 0 = 5. MD to A2 is 5 + 2 = 7. Favors A3.\n    *   (6, 2) is a good, slightly raised position for flexibility.\n\n**The Choice:**\nMoving LEFT (to 5, 1) maximizes progress toward both A2 and A3 simultaneously and offers the best central placement along the bottom half for general movement.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on or Enemy Body):**\nS1 is at (6, 4). S1 is 3 cells away from (5, 1) and will likely move to (6, 5) or (5, 4) or (7, 4) to secure A5 (4, 4) or A4 (3, 4). S1 will not move to (5, 1) this turn. No body exists for S1 yet.\n\nLet's confirm S1's likely move: S1 at (6, 4). Apples A5 (4, 4) and A4 (3, 4).\nS1 will likely move to (5, 4) [MD 1 to A5] or (6, 5) [if trying a higher route, less likely].\nIf S1 moves to (5, 4) and I move to (5, 1), we are 3 blocks apart. If S1 moves to (5, 4) and I move UP to (6, 2), we are 2 blocks apart. Moving LEFT keeps the largest distance between us horizontally.\n\nI choose LEFT (5, 1) to continue the clean sweep of the left side.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Summary (Next few turns):**\nContinue moving LEFT towards (1, 1). From x=5, I can prioritize A3 (1, 2) or A2 (1, 0) based on immediate surroundings. Since A2 is on Y=0, it is harder to reach without sacrificing future movement. I will continue moving LEFT aiming for x=1/x=2, and then adjust UP/DOWN.\n\nLEFT",

Analyzing Enemy Snake 1 (S1) movement:**\nS1 is at (5, 4). S1's targets are A5 (4, 4) (MD 1) and A4 (3, 4) (MD 2).\nPossible S1 moves:\n*   LEFT (4, 4) - Takes A5.\n*   DOWN (5, 3) - Moves closer to A4/A5 general area, avoids immediate collision if I move up.\n*   UP (5, 5) - Retreats from apples, unlikely.\n*   RIGHT (6, 4) - Retreats from apples, unlikely.\n\nIt is highly likely S1 moves LEFT to (4, 4) and eats A5.\n\n**3. Comparing Safe Moves for Snake 0:**\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT (to 4, 1):**\n    *   MD to A2/A3 drops to 4. Excellent progress.\n    *   Keeps large separation from S1 (3 blocks away if S1 goes (4, 4) or (5, 3)).\n    *   Next turn: can go Left (to 3, 1), Up (4, 2) or Down (4, 0). High flexibility. This move is directly on target for the left-side apples.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN (to 5, 0):**\n    *   MD to A2 (1, 0) is 4. Excellent.\n    *   MD to A3 (1, 2) is 6.\n    *   Restricts future moves somewhat (must go LEFT or UP next). It forces us to commit to A2 quite early.\n\n*   **Option C: Move UP (to 5, 2):**\n    *   MD to A3 (1, 2) is 4. Excellent.\n    *   MD to A2 (1, 0) is 6.\n    *   This move takes us slightly closer to S1's potential path if S1 moves DOWN to (5, 3). If S1 moves (5, 3) and I move (5, 2), we are adjacent, which is safe, but less ideal than maximizing separation.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT (4, 1) is the most flexible move that maximizes distance from S1 while making optimal progress towards both A2 and A3. It maintains a strong horizontal trajectory towards the goal area (x=1, x=2).\n\nIf S1 moves to (4, 4) (likely), and I move to (4, 1), we are 3 blocks apart, and S1 gets longer (length 2). If S1 moves to (5, 3), and I move to (4, 1), we are 2 blocks apart. All scenarios are safe.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT until I reach x=2 or x=1. Then, based on remaining apples and board congestion, I will pivot UP (for A3) or DOWN (for A2).\n\nLEFT",

(S1 was at (5, 4) last turn and moved to (5, 3) or it moved from (5, 4) to (4, 4) and ate an apple, then expanded to (5, 3). Reviewing the previous state, S1 was at (5, 4) and expected to move toward (4, 4). The current board state shows S1 at (5, 3) and apples at (3, 4) and (4, 4) still existing. This means S1 must have moved DOWN from (5, 4) to (5, 3) and missed the close apple (4, 4) and (3, 4). This is surprising but useful information).\nApples collected: 0.\n\nBoard size: 10x10.

A5 (4, 4) is now the closest apple and uncontested by S1 if I move towards it. S1 is at (5, 3).\n\n**1.

Analyzing Enemy Snake 1 (S1) movement:**\nS1 is at (5, 3). S1's targets are A5 (4, 4) (MD 2) and A4 (3, 4) (MD 3). S1 is very close to A4/A5.\nPossible S1 moves:\n*   UP (5, 4): Moves closer to A5/A4.\n*   LEFT (4, 3): Moves closer to A5/A4.\n*   DOWN (5, 2): Retreats slightly, but possibly setting up for a move toward A3 (1, 2) or A2 (1, 0) later, blocking me. Less likely.\n*   RIGHT (6, 3): Retreats, unlikely.\n\nIt is highly likely S1 moves UP (5, 4) or LEFT (4, 3) to contest the central apples (A4, A5).\n\n*   If S1 moves UP to (5, 4): S1 is still 1 step away from A5 (4, 4) and 2 steps from A4 (3, 4).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (4, 3): S1 is 1 step away from A5 (4, 4) and 2 steps from A4 (3, 4).\n\n**3. Comparing Safe Moves for Snake 0:**\n\n**A. Move LEFT (to 3, 1): Focus on A2/A3**\n*   MD to A2/A3 drops to 3. Optimal for hitting the bottom-left corner.\n*   Separation from S1 (5, 3): 2 blocks for S1 (L/U).\n*   Pro: Maximizes progress towards guaranteed side apples.\n*   Con: Allows S1 a free pass to A4/A5.\n\n**B. Move UP (to 4, 2): Focus on A5 (4, 4)**\n*   MD to A5 (4, 4) drops to 2. Might be able to intercept S1 or take A5 first.\n*   If S1 goes LEFT (4, 3): We collide head-on at (4, 2)? No, S1 goes to (4, 3) and I go to (4, 2). We are adjacent, safe. I will be 2 steps from A5, S1 will be 1 step from A5. S1 gets A5 next turn.\n*   If S1 goes UP (5, 4): I move to (4, 2). We are separated by distance 3. I am 2 steps from A5, S1 is 1 step from A5. S1 gets A5 next turn.\n*   Moving UP only makes sense if I can block S1 or take A5 first. I cannot take A5 first, and attempting to block S1 risks getting trapped or being adjacently constrained. Given S1's proximity, they will almost certainly grab A5 (4, 4) or A4 (3, 4) before me.\n\n**C. Move DOWN (to 4, 0): Focus on A2 (1, 0)**\n*   MD to A2 (1, 0) is 3. Excellent progress towards A2.\n*   Keeps maximum separation from S1 (3 blocks away minimum, regardless of S1 move).\n*   Pro: Solidifies path to A2, ensures safety.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe central apples (A4, A5) are too risky and likely to be taken by S1 next turn. If S1 moves (4, 3) or (5, 4), they are in a prime position to take A5 (4, 4). My strong advantage is controlling the bottom region.\n\nBoth LEFT (3, 1) and DOWN (4, 0) provide optimal progress towards A2/A3.\n*   LEFT (3, 1) maintains flexibility to choose A2 (down) or A3 (up) next turn (both 2 steps away).\n*   DOWN (4, 0) commits me firmly to A2 (2 steps away), keeping A3 (4 steps away).\n\nSince A2 (1, 0) and A3 (1, 2) are equally distant now (4 steps), moving to (3, 1) keeps options open longer. It aims for the vertical line x=1, which serves both target apples.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT until (2, 1) or (1, 1). Then pivot to capture A2 (1, 0) and A3 (1, 2). If S1 captures A4 and A5, I need to ensure I maintain my apple advantage by swiftly securing A2 and A3.\n\nLEFT",

S1 has moved away from the central cluster.\nPossible S1 targets: A4 (3, 4) (MD 4), A5 (4, 4) (MD 3), or A1 (2, 8) (MD 7).\nLikely S1 moves from (6, 3):\n*   LEFT (5, 3): Moves toward A5 (4, 4). This is the most logical short-term move.\n*   UP (6, 4): Moves toward A1 (2, 8).\n*   DOWN (6, 2) or RIGHT (7, 3): Less likely immediate apple pressure.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (5, 3), they re-engage A4/A5. Distance remains large enough that S1 cannot block me from the bottom left apples, A2 and A3.\n\n**3. Comparing Safe Moves for Snake 0 (3, 1):**\n\n**A. Move LEFT (to 2, 1): Focus on A2/A3**\n*   MD to A2 (1, 0) and A3 (1, 2) drops to 2 (1 step away from the x=1 column).\n*   Pro: Keeps momentum toward the corner, secures two apples first.\n*   Con: Increases distance to A4 (3, 4) to 4 steps.\n\n**B. Move UP (to 3, 2): Focus on A3/A4**\n*   MD to A4 (3, 4) drops to 2. MD to A3 (1, 2) drops to 2.\n*   Pro: Keeps options for A3 and A4 open. A4 is easier to reach (vertical travel only), and A3 requires horizontal travel next. This is a very flexible move.\n*   If I move UP to (3, 2) and S1 moves LEFT to (5, 3): S1 is 2 steps from A4. I am 2 steps from A4. It's a race, but I have the positional advantage since I'm already in the column.\n\n**C. Move DOWN (to 3, 0): Focus on A2**\n*   MD to A2 (1, 0) drops to 2.\n*   Pro: Direct path to A2.\n*   Con: Less flexible regarding A3/A4.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 1) is great for securing A2 (1, 0) and A3 (1, 2). I would choose this if I wanted to ignore the central apples entirely.\nMoving UP to (3, 2) allows me to race S1 for A4 (3, 4) or pivot immediately to A3 (1, 2). Since A4 is 3 steps away from my current position (3, 1), and S1 is currently 4 steps away from A4 (6, 3) (e.g., L, L, U, U to 3, 4), I have an advantage in terms of MD if I move UP.\n\n*   My path to A4 (3, 4) if I move UP: (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4). 3 steps total, arriving Turn 29.\n*   S1 path to A4 (3, 4) if they move L, U, U, L: (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4). 4 steps total.\n*   If S1 moves L, U, U, U, L: (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4). 4 steps total.\n\nCrucially, S1 is length 1 and has high flexibility. If S1 moves L to (5, 3), L to (4, 3), L to (3, 3), and then U to (3, 4), they get there in 4 moves if they move only L for the first two steps. Still 4 moves minimum.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 2), I shorten the distance to A4 to 2 steps, and I arrive in 2 turns. This guarantees A4, provided S1 does not manage a 2-turn move (which is impossible from (6, 3)).\n\nTherefore, moving UP to target A4 (3, 4) is the optimal path for maximizing apple gain, as it is safe and ensures I can beat S1 to this apple. It also keeps A3 (1, 2) as a strong secondary option (2 steps away via a LEFT move).\n\nI choose UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nCapture A4 (3, 4) in two turns by moving UP, then UP again. After A4 is secured, pivot LEFT/DOWN to rapidly secure either A3 (1, 2) or A2 (1, 0).\n\nUP",

S1 is far from my immediate targets A3 and A4.\nPossible S1 moves:\n*   LEFT (6, 3): Moves back toward the center.

Comparing Safe Moves for Snake 0 (3, 2):**\n\n**A. Move UP (to 3, 3): Targeting A4 (3, 4)**\n*   Leads directly to A4 in 1 turn (next turn: Move UP to (3, 4) and eat A4).\n*   Pro: Easy, direct, guarantees apple acquisition, extends my length vertically.\n*   Con: None, as S1 is far away.\n\n**B. Move LEFT (to 2, 2): Targeting A3 (1, 2)**\n*   Leads almost directly to A3 in 1 turn (next turn: Move LEFT to (1, 2) and eat A3).\n*   Pro: Secures A3 quickly.\n*   Con: A bit more twisting/closing in on myself than the vertical UP move.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nBoth UP and LEFT lead to an apple in 1 turn (i.e., I move there now, then spend next turn eating it).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 3): Next move is UP to (3, 4). Apple A4 secured.\n*After A4 is eaten (Turn 29)*, my head is at (3, 4). My body starts filling the (3, 3) to (3, 1) column, forcing me to maneuver around my body when going for A3 (1, 2) or A5 (4, 4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 2): Next move is LEFT to (1, 2). Apple A3 secured.\n*After A3 is eaten (Turn 29)*, my head is at (1, 2). My body is mostly spread across y=1 row. This position is excellent for targeting A2 (1, 0) immediately afterward.\n\nComparing the sequence:\n1. **Sequence A (UP):** (3, 2) -> (3, 3). Turn 29: (3, 3) -> (3, 4) [EAT A4]. Next targets: A5 (4, 4) or A3 (1, 2). Getting to A3 requires going L, L, D, D around my body, which is complicated. A5 is close (MD 1) but requires moving R, R.\n2. **Sequence B (LEFT):** (3, 2) -> (2, 2). Turn 29: (2, 2) -> (1, 2) [EAT A3]. Next targets: A2 (1, 0). Getting to A2 is simple (DOWN, DOWN). (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0).\n\nSequence B is better because it secures three tightly clustered apples (A3, A2, and later possibly A4) sequentially and keeps my body contained in the bottom-left corner, maximizing the available space for future maneuvers. It creates a good flow (LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN...).\n\nI choose LEFT to (2, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Sequence B Focus):**\nT28: Move LEFT to (2, 2).\nT29: Move LEFT to (1, 2) [EAT A3].\nT30: Move DOWN to (1, 1).\nT31: Move DOWN to (1, 0) [EAT A2].\nAfter securing 8 apples, I will then assess the situation for A4 (3, 4) and A5 (4, 4).\n\nLEFT",

S1 moved from (8, 3) to (9, 3) (RIGHT).\n\nApples remaining:\nA1: (2, 8) (MD 7 from (1, 2))\nA2: (1, 0) (MD 2 from (1, 2)) <- Primary Target (next score)\nA3: (3, 4) (MD 4 from (1, 2))\nA4: (4, 4) (MD 5 from (1, 2))\n\nThe immediate strategic goal is to secure Apple A2 (1, 0), following the plan from the previous turn.\n\n**1. Evaluate Immediate Safe Moves from (1, 2):**\n\n*   My occupied body/head locations: (1, 2) [H], (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1).\n*   Tail (apple *was* eaten last turn): The cell (7, 1) remains occupied.\n*   S1 Head: (9, 3).\n\n*   **UP (to 1, 3):** Safe. Moves away from A2. (MD to A2 = 3).\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 1):** Safe. Moves one step closer to A2 (1, 0). This is the planned intermediate step. (MD to A2 = 1). **Excellent move.**\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 2):** Safe. Moves away from A2. (MD to A2 = 3).\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 2):** Collision with B1 (2, 2). **FATAL MOVE! Eliminate.** Moving directly backward into the segment I just vacated.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent Threat (Snake #1):**\nS1 is at (9, 3). S1 is in the top right quadrant, far from my current location and targets (A1 is far but closer to S1 than A2/A3/A4).\nS1 is 9 cells x-distance away, 1 cell y-distance away from my head.\nNo immediate collision risk or apple competition.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (1, 1) is the required intermediate step to reach the target apple A2 (1, 0) safely next turn.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan Refinement:**\nT30: Move DOWN to (1, 1). Head: (1, 1). Tail remains at (7, 1).\nT31: Move DOWN to (1, 0) [EAT A2]. Head: (1, 0). Length 10. Tail remains at (7, 1).\n\nAfter A2 is eaten, the head is (1, 0).\nApples remaining: (2, 8), (3, 4), (4, 4).\n*   A3 (3, 4): MD 6 from (1, 0).\n*   A4 (4, 4): MD 7 from (1, 0).\n*   A1 (2, 8): MD 9 from (1, 0).\n\nThe cluster around (3, 4) and (4, 4) is the next logical target. From (1, 0), I would move RIGHT to (2, 0) or UP/RIGHT towards (3, 4). Next move will likely be UP to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (2, 0) to reposition for the central apples.\n\nDOWN",
