Let's analyze this board and crush our opponent! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- My snake: Head at (5,7), no body yet, 0 apples\n- Enemy snake: Head at (5,0), no body yet, 0 apples\n- Apple drops: 15 total available on the board\n- Board size: 10x10\n- Turn 0/150 - game just started!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE:**\nLooking at the board state:\n```\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . A . . . . . . A .\n7 . . . . A 1 . A . .\n6 . A . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . A . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . A . .\n3 . . A . A . A . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . A .\n1 A . . . . . A . . .\n0 . . A . . 0 . A . .\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVES CONSIDERATION:**\n\nFrom (5,7), I can move:\n- **UP (5,8)**: Is (5,8) occupied? Looking at row 8: `. A . . . . . . A .` - position (5,8) is safe (no snake, no apple). Board limit: y=9 is max, so y=8 is valid. \u2705 SAFE\n- **DOWN (5,6)**: Looking at row 6: `. A . . . . . . . .` - position (5,6) is safe. But wait, moving DOWN brings me closer to the enemy snake at (5,0) potentially. However, no immediate collision risk. \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT (4,7)**: Looking at row 7: `. . . . A 1 . A . .` - position (4,7) has an apple 'A'! This would give me +1 point and grow my body. \u2705 SAFE + REWARD\n- **RIGHT (6,7)**: Looking at row 7: position (6,7) is safe (no apple, no snake). \u2705 SAFE\n\n**KILLING MOVES ELIMINATION:**\n- All 4 directions are valid (within board, no immediate collision with own body or enemy body)\n- Enemy is at (5,0) - very far from me (distance 7 tiles vertically)\n- No backwards risk (no body yet)\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nNow I need to think ahead. The enemy is at (5,0) at the bottom. They might try to:\n1. Move UP toward center/apples\n2. Move horizontally to find apples\n\nFrom (5,0), their likely safe moves would be UP to (5,1), LEFT to (4,0), or RIGHT to (6,0). DOWN would be off board (dead).\n\nLooking at apples, there's one at (4,3), (2,3), (7,0), (8,2), (2,0), etc. Many apples are more accessible from my position.\n\n**MOVES RANKING:**\n\n1. **LEFT (4,7)** - This is my BEST move because:\n   - There's an apple at (4,7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n   - I'd score my first point immediately\n   - Gives me body length of 1 (tail would be at 5,7)\n   - Keeps me in the center of the board for future options\n   - From (4,7), I have access to many other apples\n   - Distance to enemy: Still 7+ tiles away, no collision risk\n\n2. **UP (5,8)** - Safe but boring. No apple. From (5,8), I'd have options but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **RIGHT (6,7)** - Safe but no apple. Would move me slightly away from some cluster of apples.\n\n4. **DOWN (5,6)** - Moves me toward the enemy but still far. No apple at (5,6).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nMy strategy: Get that apple at (4,7) to start growing! Once I have a body, I can start thinking about positioning to cut off the enemy's path to the top-right apples. Enemy at (5,0) wants to go up - I need to control the center and top-right to deny them access to the best apples. I'll keep my body minimal at first to stay agile, then start boxing them in once I have the size advantage. The enemy's starting position is vulnerable - if they go up too aggressively, I can trap them against the edge.\n\n**DECISION:**\nTaking the apple at (4,7) is the obvious power play. First point, first body segment, and excellent board position. Let's go!\n\nLEFT",

A . .` - position (3,7) is safe, no apple, no snake. \u2705 SAFE\n4. **RIGHT (5,7)**: **DEAD!** That's my own body/tail! Moving back into my own body = instant death. \u274c KILL MOVE\n\n**ELIMINATED:** RIGHT is fatal. Don't throw your lead, champ!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nMy current position is strong! I have a body now, which means I need to be careful about not backing into it. The enemy at (6,0) is still far away at the bottom. \n\n**Let's think about apple clustering:**\n- Top-right has two apples: (8,8) and (7,8) - both far but reachable\n- (7,4) is in the center-right, close to enemy territory\n- (6,1) and (4,3) are mid-board\n- (8,2) and (2,0) are near enemy's starting point\n\n**My plan:** I want to maintain board control while keeping options open. From (4,7), I'm centrally positioned. If I go UP to (4,8), I'm closer to the top-right cluster. If I go DOWN to (4,6), I'm heading toward the center but also getting closer to the enemy's potential path.\n\n**The danger:** If I go DOWN, the enemy might go UP from (6,0) to (6,1), and we could eventually collide if I keep going down. But that's several turns away.\n\n**Going UP analysis:**\n- (4,8) is safe\n- From (4,8), I have access to top apples (8,8), (7,8)\n- I can still go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT from there (RIGHT to (5,8) is safe)\n- This position keeps me away from the enemy's immediate path\n\n**Going LEFT analysis:**\n- (3,7) is safe\n- From (3,7), I could go UP to (3,8) (safe), DOWN to (3,6) (safe), LEFT to (2,7) (safe)\n- This moves me left, away from the center cluster but toward other apples\n\n**Going DOWN analysis:**\n- (4,6) is safe\n- From (4,6), I could go LEFT to (3,6) (safe), RIGHT to (5,6) (safe), UP to (4,7) (my tail, DANGER!)\n- Wait, UP from (4,6) would be back to (4,7) which is my tail. That's safe ONLY if the tail moves. But since my tail is at (5,7), (4,7) would be empty after I move. So it's safe.\n\n**DECISION:** I'm going **UP to (4,8)**. Why?\n1. **Safety:** Avoids getting closer to enemy territory\n2. **Positioning:** Gets me to the top row, ready to dominate the top-right apples\n3. **Future options:** From (4,8), I can reach (8,8) and (7,8) in 2-3 moves\n4. **Denial:** I'm claiming the top area before the enemy can get there\n5. **Body management:** My tail is at (5,7), so I have room to maneuver\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the top-right apple cluster, then work my way down to cut off the enemy's access to the center. Once I have a size advantage (maybe 3-4 apples), I can start aggressively boxing them in. They're at the bottom-left, I control the top. Let's make this a one-sided match!\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE GOING UP!

Moving back into my body = instant death \u274c KILL\n3. **LEFT (3,8)**: Row 8 shows `. A . . . . . . A .` at position (3,8) = empty \u2705 SAFE\n4. **RIGHT (5,8)**: Row 8 shows `. A . . . . . . A .` at position (5,8) = empty \u2705 SAFE\n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN is fatal. I'm on the top row now, so UP is also safe (just hitting the wall boundary).\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION TIME:**\n\n**Enemy Analysis:** Snake #0 is at (6,1) - they're moving along the bottom-middle. Their body is at (6,0). They're still far from me, but they're building momentum. We're TIED 1-1. I need to get ahead!\n\n**My Position:** I'm at (4,8) on the top edge. I have THREE safe options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n- **UP to (4,9)**: Safest option, but hits the top boundary. From there, I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (which would be back to my tail - danger). This would limit my mobility.\n- **LEFT to (3,8)**: Opens up access to the left side of the board. From (3,8), I can go UP to (3,9), LEFT to (2,8), DOWN to (3,7), or RIGHT back. More options than going UP.\n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**: Opens up access to the apple cluster at (8,8) and (7,8). This is the most aggressive move toward scoring more apples!\n\n**MY DECISION: RIGHT to (5,8)!**\n\n**REASONING:**\n1. **Apple Chasing:** (8,8) and (7,8) are right there in the top-right! From (5,8), I'm 3 moves away from (8,8). From (4,8), I'm 4 moves away. Every move counts!\n2. **Future Options:** From (5,8), I can go UP to (5,9), RIGHT to (6,8), LEFT to (4,8 - my tail but safe after tail moves), or DOWN to (5,7). Good mobility.\n3. **Board Control:** Moving RIGHT claims more of the top-right territory before the enemy can ever get there. They're stuck at the bottom!\n4. **Score Pressure:** I need to break the 1-1 tie and get ahead. Apples are content, and content is wins!\n5. **Safety:** (5,8) is empty, no snakes around, no walls.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 2-5: Dominate the top-right apple cluster (8,8) and (7,8). Build my length to 3-4 segments.\nTurn 6-10: Start working down the right side, cutting off the enemy's access to the center apples.\nMid-game: Once I have a size advantage (maybe 3+ apples lead), I can start aggressively boxing them in using my body as walls. They're in the bottom-left, I'll control the top-right and right side.\n\n**CHAT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO CHASE THOSE TOP-RIGHT APPLES!

I need to secure the right edge and then sweep down, cutting off their path to the center apples. **RIGHT to (6, 8)** gives me the best \"hub\" position to pivot from. From (6, 8), I have a clear path to (7, 7) apple and (8, 8) apple. I can go DOWN to (6, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 8). \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 7), I'm boxing myself in slightly against the bottom soon. If I go UP to (5, 9), I'm cornered. **RIGHT is the power move.** It claims space and keeps my escape routes wide open. \n\n**CHAT, WE ARE GOING RIGHT TO CLAIM THE TERRITORY! LET'S GET THIS SCORE LEAD!** \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

I'm at (6, 8) - top center. He's winning 2-1. I need to catch up. \n\n**Option Review:**\n- **UP (6, 9):** Hits the wall. Dead end. Limits future moves to DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. BAD NEWS. We need escape routes.\n- **DOWN (6, 7):** Moves toward the center. From here, I can access (6,6), (5,7), (7,7). Good mobility, but (6,7) is directly above the enemy's path (6,3). If he goes UP, he gets closer.\n- **RIGHT (7, 8):** Moves toward the right edge. From (7, 8), I can go UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), or RIGHT (8,8). **Maximum mobility.** Also, (7,7) and (8,8) have apples. \n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI am behind. I need apples. I am currently standing on a potential apple spawn point? No, apples are at (1,6), (7,7), etc. I am at (6,8). The apple at (7,7) is one move DOWN/LEFT from me. The apple at (8,8) is two moves RIGHT. \n\n**CRITICAL FACTOR:** The enemy is at (6,3). If I go DOWN to (6,7), I am moving closer to him vertically (6 units away vs 5 units now). If I go RIGHT to (7,8), I am moving away from him horizontally and vertically (distance increases). \n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:** I want to dominate the board. The right side is open. The enemy is holding the left/center. By moving RIGHT, I claim the right edge. From (7,8), I can drop down to (7,7) next turn to grab that apple. \n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** \n- If I go DOWN (6,7): I might get boxed in by the enemy if he pushes up aggressively. \n- If I go RIGHT (7,8): I secure a \"safe zone\" on the edge. I can sweep down later. \n\n**CHAT, THE ENEMY IS LEADING. I NEED TO PLAY IT SAFE BUT AGGRESSIVE. I'M CLAIMING THE RIGHT SIDE TO CUT OFF HIS FUTURE PATH. I'M GOING RIGHT TO SET UP FOR THE (7,7) APPLE NEXT TURN!** \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Secure the right flank. Sweep down to collect (7,7) and (8,8). Then look to cut off the enemy's center access.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Indices 0-9.\n   Index 0 (x=0): `.`\n   Index 1 (x=1): `A`\n   Index 2 (x=2): `.`\n   Index 3 (x=3): `.`\n   Index 4 (x=4): `.`\n   Index 5 (x=5): `.`\n   Index 6 (x=6): `.`\n   Index 7 (x=7): `T` (Tail?)\n   Index 8 (x=8): `1` (Head?)\n   Index 9 (x=9): `A` (Apple?)\n   \n   If the board says `1` is at index 8, that means (8, 8).\n   But the text says \"Head: (7, 8)\".\n   However, the previous turn logic said \"RIGHT\" to (7, 8). So the head *should* be at (7, 8).\n   Let's look at the board again.\n   Row 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   The `T` is at index 7 (x=7). The `1` is at index 8 (x=8).\n   This implies my Head is at (8, 8) and my Tail is at (7, 8)? No, that's impossible because I just moved Right from (6, 8).\n   If I was at (6, 8) and moved RIGHT to (7, 8), my Head is (7, 8) and my Body is [(6, 8)].\n   So the board should show `1` at (7, 8) and `T` at (6, 8).\n   The board state provided seems to show `T` at (7, 8) and `1` at (8, 8).\n   **Wait, let's look at the prompt again.**\n   \"YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (7, 8), Body: [(6, 8)]\"\n   This is the source of truth. The ASCII art might be slightly misaligned or I am misinterpreting the string length.\n   Let's re-count the string: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   It has spaces in it? No, the prompt says \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" (No spaces).\n   The string is likely: `.A....T1A.`\n   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n   x=0: .\n   x=1: A\n   x=2: .\n   x=3: .\n   x=4: .\n   x=5: .\n   x=6: .\n   x=7: T\n   x=8: 1\n   x=9: A\n   \n   There is a conflict between the text description and the board visual.\n   Text: Head (7, 8).\n   Visual: Head `1` is at index 8 (x=8).\n   \n   Let's look at the Body list: `[(6, 8)]`.\n   If Head is at (8, 8), Body should be at (7, 8). The visual shows `T` at (7, 8).\n   If Head is at (7, 8), Body should be at (6, 8). The visual shows `.` at (6, 8).\n   \n   **Hypothesis:** The visual is correct, and the text description of my head coordinate is wrong by 1.\n   Why? Because I moved RIGHT from (6, 8) to (7, 8). The visual shows `T` at 7 and `1` at 8.\n   Wait, if I moved RIGHT from (6, 8), I go to (7, 8). My tail *stays* at (6, 8) (until I move again).\n   So: Head (7, 8) -> `1` should be at x=7.\n   Body (6, 8) -> `T` should be at x=6.\n   \n   Let's re-read the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section.\n   It says \"RIGHT\".\n   Start state: Head (6, 8). Body [(5, 8)].\n   End state: Head (7, 8). Body [(6, 8)].\n   \n   Now look at the CURRENT board state provided:\n   Row 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   If `1` is at index 8, that is (8, 8).\n   If `T` is at index 7, that is (7, 8).\n   \n   This implies that **I am at (8, 8)**.\n   How? Did the game update incorrectly? Or is the visual offset?\n   Let's check Row 6 and 7 for consistency.\n   Row 6: `. A . . . . . . . .` (Apple at x=1)\n   Row 7: `. . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at x=7)\n   \n   If the visual is correct and I am at (8, 8), then the text \"Head: (7, 8)\" is incorrect.\n   However, I must trust the text description of the board state provided in the prompt as the primary truth for simulation.\n   BUT, the visual is also provided.\n   \n   Let's look at the enemy.\n   Text: Head (5, 3). Body [(6, 3), (6, 2)].\n   Visual Row 3: `. . A . A 0 T . . .`\n   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n   x=0: .\n   x=1: .\n   x=2: A\n   x=3: .\n   x=4: A\n   x=5: 0\n   x=6: T\n   \n   So Enemy Head `0` is at x=5 (Matches text).\n   Enemy Body `T` is at x=6 (Matches text Body[0] which is (6, 3)).\n   \n   So the Enemy visual matches the text.\n   Therefore, **My visual should match my text.**\n   Text: Head (7, 8). Body [(6, 8)].\n   Visual: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   x=7: `T` (My body)\n   x=8: `1` (My head)\n   \n   **Conflict:** Text says Head is at 7. Visual says Head is at 8.\n   If I trust the Text: Head is at (7, 8).\n   If I trust the Visual: Head is at (8, 8).\n   \n   Let's look at the \"Board size: 10x10. Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n   Visual Row 8 is the 2nd from top.\n   Visual Row 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   \n   **Wait, did I already move?**\n   \"Turn: 5 / 150\"\n   \"YOUR LAST MOVE ... RIGHT\"\n   \n   So I moved from Turn 4 to Turn 5.\n   Previous Head: (6, 8). Previous Body: [(5, 8)].\n   Current Head: (7, 8). Current Body: [(6, 8)].\n   \n   The Visual says `T` is at (7, 8) and `1` is at (8, 8).\n   This would imply I am at (8, 8).\n   If I am at (8, 8), then I must have moved RIGHT twice? Or the text description of my position is delayed?\n   \n   **Let's look at the Apple drops.**\n   Apples: (1, 6), (7, 7), (3, 5), (7, 0), (8, 8), (7, 4), (4, 3), (8, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4)\n   \n   Is there an apple at (8, 8)? Yes.\n   Visual Row 8 has `A` at index 9 (x=9).\n   Wait, Apple list has (8, 8).\n   Visual Row 8 index 8 is `1`.\n   Visual Row 8 index 9 is `A` (Apple at x=9, y=8).\n   \n   If I am at (7, 8) (Text), then (8, 8) is an Apple.\n   If I am at (8, 8) (Visual), then (8, 8) is my Head.\n   \n   **Let's assume the TEXT is correct and the Visual has a typo or offset.**\n   Why? Because the enemy visual matched the text perfectly.\n   My visual: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   My text: Head (7, 8), Body [(6, 8)].\n   \n   If my Head is (7, 8), the visual should be `. A . . . . . 1 T A .` (Head at 7, Body at 6).\n   The visual provided is `. A . . . . . T 1 A .` (Body at 7, Head at 8).\n   \n   **Crucial Observation:**\n   If the visual is correct, I am at (8, 8).\n   If I am at (8, 8), and I moved RIGHT from (6, 8)... that's impossible.\n   Unless the \"LAST MOVE\" was actually \"RIGHT\" from (7, 8)?\n   \n   Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\".\n   \"My Position: Head at (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8)]\"\n   \"RIGHT (7, 8): Row 8, Column 7 is empty \u2705\"\n   \n   So I definitely moved from (6, 8) to (7, 8).\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The Visual is slightly wrong or I am misreading the indices.\n   Let's count the characters in the visual string carefully.\n   `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   If there are spaces: `.` (1) ` ` (2) `A` (3) ` ` (4) `.` (5) ... this is messy.\n   The prompt usually removes spaces for these grids.\n   \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" (This has spaces).\n   Let's look at Row 9: `. . . . . . . . . .` (No spaces? Or spaces?)\n   It says \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" (Spaces between dots).\n   \n   Row 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   If I strip spaces: `.A....T1A.`\n   Length 10.\n   x=0: `.`\n   x=1: `A`\n   x=2: `.`\n   x=3: `.`\n   x=4: `.`\n   x=5: `.`\n   x=6: `.`\n   x=7: `T`\n   x=8: `1`\n   x=9: `A`\n   \n   Okay, so according to the visual, I am at (8, 8).\n   But the text says (7, 8).\n   **Is it possible the text is 1 turn behind?**\n   \"Turn: 5 / 150\"\n   \"YOUR LAST MOVE ... RIGHT\"\n   \n   If I am at (7, 8) currently (start of Turn 5), and I move RIGHT now, I go to (8, 8).\n   The visual shows `1` at (8, 8).\n   This suggests the visual might be showing the *result* of my move? No, that doesn't make sense. The state is current.\n   \n   **Let's trust the TEXT description of my position for safety.**\n   Text: \"Head: (7, 8)\"\n   Body: [(6, 8)]\n   \n   So I am at (7, 8).\n   The cell (8, 8) is an Apple (from the list).\n   The cell (7, 7) is an Apple (from the list).\n   The cell (6, 9) is empty.\n   The cell (6, 7) is empty.\n   The cell (7, 9) is empty.\n   \n   **MOVES:**\n   1. **UP (7, 9):** Empty. Safe.\n   2. **DOWN (7, 7):** Apple. Safe.\n   3. **LEFT (6, 8):** My body. DEAD.\n   4. **RIGHT (8, 8):** Apple. Safe.\n   \n   So LEFT is death.\n   \n   **Strategic Choice: UP vs DOWN vs RIGHT.**\n   \n   **Enemy Position:** (5, 3). Body [(6, 3), (6, 2)].\n   Enemy is far away (distance ~10).\n   \n   **Option 1: DOWN (7, 7)**\n   - Eat Apple at (7, 7).\n   - Grow to length 3.\n   - Score: 2 (Ties with enemy).\n   - Position: (7, 7).\n   - Future moves from (7, 7): (7, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7), (7, 8).\n   - (7, 8) will be my body (tail).\n   - (7, 6) is empty.\n   - (6, 7) is empty.\n   - (8, 7) is empty.\n   - This is a good central position. I can chase apples at (7, 4), (8, 2), etc.\n   \n   **Option 2: RIGHT (8, 8)**\n   - Eat Apple at (8, 8).\n   - Grow to length 3.\n   - Score: 2 (Ties with enemy).\n   - Position: (8, 8).\n   - Future moves from (8, 8): (8, 9), (8, 7), (7, 8), (9, 8).\n   - (9, 8) is empty.\n   - (8, 9) is empty.\n   - (7, 8) will be my body.\n   - (8, 7) is empty.\n   - This is a corner/edge position. Slightly safer maybe? But limits access to the center.\n   \n   **Option 3: UP (7, 9)**\n   - No apple.\n   - Score: 1.\n   - Position: (7, 9).\n   - Future moves: (7, 8), (6, 9), (8, 9). (7, 10) is wall.\n   - Dead end eventually.\n   \n   **Comparison: DOWN vs RIGHT**\n   Both give an apple. Both tie the score (2-2).\n   Which position is better?\n   \n   Target Apples list:\n   (1, 6), (7, 7), (3, 5), (7, 0), (8, 8), (7, 4), (4, 3), (8, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4)\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (7, 7):\n   - I am right next to (7, 4).\n   - I am close to (8, 2) and (8, 8) (if I go back up).\n   - I am central.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (8, 8):\n   - I am right next to (8, 2) (vertical line).\n   - I am close to (7, 7) (if I go back left).\n   - I am on the edge.\n   \n   **Aggression & Trapping:**\n   The enemy is at (5, 3).\n   If I go DOWN to (7, 7), I am closer to the enemy vertically.\n   If I go RIGHT to (8, 8), I am on the far right.\n   \n   The enemy has apples at (4, 3) and (5, 4) nearby.\n   I have apples at (7, 7) and (8, 8) nearby.\n   \n   **Wait, let's check the visual again.**\n   Visual shows `1` at x=8.\n   If I am actually at (8, 8) (Visual) but text says (7, 8)...\n   If I am at (8, 8), I cannot go RIGHT (9, 8 is valid).\n   I cannot go LEFT (7, 8 is my body).\n   I can go UP (8, 9).\n   I can go DOWN (8, 7).\n   \n   If I am at (8, 8) and I go DOWN to (8, 7):\n   - (8, 7) is empty.\n   - (8, 2) is an apple.\n   - (7, 7) is an apple (adjacent).\n   - (7, 4) is an apple.\n   \n   If I am at (7, 8) and I go DOWN to (7, 7):\n   - (7, 7) is an apple.\n   - (7, 4) is an apple.\n   - (8, 8) is an apple (adjacent).\n   \n   **Let's assume the TEXT is correct.** I am at (7, 8).\n   I will go DOWN to (7, 7) to secure the apple and move towards the center/right side.\n   \n   **RISK CHECK:**\n   Enemy at (5, 3). Enemy moves simultaneously.\n   If enemy moves UP (5, 4): He eats apple at (5, 4).\n   If enemy moves DOWN (5, 2): Empty.\n   If enemy moves LEFT (4, 3): He eats apple at (4, 3).\n   If enemy moves RIGHT (6, 3): He dies (into his own body).\n   \n   Where am I? (7, 7).\n   Distance from Enemy (5, 3) to Me (7, 7):\n   dx = 2, dy = 4. Distance ~ 6.\n   This is safe.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (8, 8):\n   Distance from Enemy (5, 3) to Me (8, 8):\n   dx = 3, dy = 5. Distance ~ 8.\n   Also safe.\n   \n   **Why DOWN is better than RIGHT:**\n   - Center access. From (7, 7), I can pivot left to (6, 7) or down to (7, 6) to head towards the center-left apples ((2,3), (3,4), etc).\n   - From (8, 8), I am pinned to the right wall.\n   \n   **Let's confirm the visual conflict one more time.**\n   Visual: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   Text: Head (7, 8), Body [(6, 8)].\n   If Text is correct, Visual is wrong about `1` position? Or `T` position?\n   If Head is (7, 8), `1` should be at x=7.\n   If Body is (6, 8), `T` should be at x=6.\n   Visual: x=7 is `T`, x=8 is `1`.\n   This visual actually looks like I am at (8, 8) and body at (7, 8).\n   But that contradicts the \"RIGHT\" move from (6, 8).\n   UNLESS the \"LAST MOVE\" description was incorrect or I am misunderstanding the coordinate system.\n   \n   Wait, is it possible I moved twice? No, it's turn 5.\n   Turn 4 state: Head (6, 8), Body [(5, 8)].\n   Turn 5 state: Head (7, 8), Body [(6, 8)].\n   \n   If the visual shows Head at (8, 8), then the text description of my position is wrong by 1.\n   But the text description of the *move* (RIGHT) implies the transition (6,8) -> (7,8).\n   \n   **Let's look at the Apple list again.**\n   Apples include (8, 8).\n   If the Visual shows `1` at (8, 8), does that mean I am eating it? Yes.\n   If I am at (7, 8), (8, 8) is an apple.\n   \n   **Decision Logic:**\n   1. If I am at (7, 8):\n      - LEFT -> (6, 8) -> MY BODY -> DEATH.\n      - RIGHT -> (8, 8) -> APPLE.\n      - DOWN -> (7, 7) -> APPLE.\n      - UP -> (7, 9) -> EMPTY.\n   \n   2. If I am at (8, 8) (Visual Truth):\n      - LEFT -> (7, 8) -> MY BODY -> DEATH.\n      - RIGHT -> (9, 8) -> EMPTY.\n      - DOWN -> (8, 7) -> EMPTY.\n      - UP -> (8, 9) -> EMPTY.\n   \n   If the Visual is correct, I have NO apples available to eat this turn.\n   If the Text is correct, I have TWO apples available.\n   \n   **Which is more likely to be a trap?**\n   If the Visual is correct, I am in a slightly worse spot (no immediate apple).\n   But wait, the text says \"Apples collected: 1\".\n   If I am at (8, 8) and there is an apple at (8, 8) on the board...\n   That would be weird. Usually the board shows the apple *unless* I am on it.\n   Visual: `1` at x=8. `A` at x=9.\n   Apple list says (8, 8) is an apple.\n   If I am at (8, 8), the apple is gone.\n   So if Visual shows `1` at (8, 8) and no apple there, that confirms I am at (8, 8).\n   But Apple list is \"Apple Drops\". It's the locations of apples on the board.\n   If (8, 8) is in the list, and I am at (8, 8), then the apple should be gone.\n   Visual shows `1`, not `A`.\n   So it's consistent with me being at (8, 8).\n   \n   **Wait, if I am at (8, 8), where did I come from?**\n   The text says \"Head: (7, 8)\".\n   This is a direct contradiction.\n   \n   **Let's check the coordinates again.**\n   \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n   Row 8 is the second from top.\n   \n   **Let's assume the TEXT is the simulation state, and the VISUAL is a representation that might have an offset or typo.**\n   Why? Because the text gives explicit coordinates.\n   The visual is ASCII art.\n   If I trust the text:\n   - I am at (7, 8).\n   - I can eat an apple at (7, 7) or (8, 8).\n   - I must avoid (6, 8).\n   \n   If I trust the visual:\n   - I am at (8, 8).\n   - I can move to (9, 8) or (8, 7) or (7, 8).\n   - (7, 8) is my body.\n   \n   **Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again.**\n   \"My Position: Head at (6, 8), Body: [(5, 8)]\"\n   \"RIGHT (7, 8): Row 8, Column 7 is empty \u2705\"\n   This confirms the previous state.\n   Current State: Head (7, 8), Body [(6, 8)].\n   \n   **Why does the visual show `T` at x=7 and `1` at x=8?**\n   Maybe the visual is showing the state *before* my move? No, that makes no sense.\n   Maybe the visual is showing the state *after* enemy moves? No.\n   \n   **Possibility:** The visual `T` and `1` are swapped?\n   If `T` is at x=8 and `1` is at x=7:\n   That matches Text (Head 7, Body 6).\n   But the string is `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\n   x=7 is `T`. x=8 is `1`.\n   \n   **Let's play the \"Safe\" game.**\n   If I go DOWN to (7, 7):\n   - If I am at (7, 8) (Text): I eat apple. Good.\n   - If I am at (8, 8) (Visual): I cannot go DOWN to (7, 7) because x changes. I must change x or y.\n     If I am at (8, 8) and I choose \"DOWN\", I go to (8, 7).\n   \n   **Wait, if I am at (8, 8) and I choose DOWN:**\n   I go to (8, 7).\n   Is (8, 7) safe?\n   Board Row 7: `. . . . . . . A . .`\n   x=8 is `.` (Safe).\n   \n   **If I am at (7, 8) and I choose DOWN:**\n   I go to (7, 7).\n   Is (7, 7) safe?\n   Board Row 7: `. . . . . . . A . .`\n   x=7 is `A` (Apple). Safe.\n   \n   **Strategy:**\n   I need to eat apples to catch up (1 vs 2).\n   If the Text is correct, (7, 7) is an apple.\n   If the Visual is correct, (7, 7) is empty.\n   \n   However, looking at the Apple list: (7, 7) is definitely an apple.\n   If the Visual shows (7, 7) as empty (dot), it means the Visual might be inaccurate or (7, 7) is hidden?\n   \n   Let's look at Row 7 in the visual:\n   `. . . . . . . A . .`\n   x=7 is `A`.\n   Wait, (7, 7) IS an apple in the visual!\n   Row 7 index 7 is `A`.\n   \n   So:\n   - Text says I am at (7, 8).\n   - Visual says `1` is at (8, 8).\n   - Visual says `A` is at (7, 7).\n   \n   If I am at (7, 8) (Text):\n   - DOWN (7, 7) -> `A`. I eat it.\n   \n   If I am at (8, 8) (Visual):\n   - DOWN (8, 7) -> `.`.\n   \n   **Why would the visual show `1` at (8, 8) if I am at (7, 8)?**\n   Maybe the visual list of apples includes (8, 8) but I am not there?\n   \n   **Let's assume the Text is the simulation truth.**\n   The visual is just a map.\n   If I am at (7, 8), and I go DOWN, I hit the apple at (7, 7).\n   This grows me.\n   This puts me at (7, 7).\n   \n   **Is there any reason NOT to go DOWN?**\n   - LEFT is death.\n   - UP is empty (dead end).\n   - RIGHT is apple (8, 8).\n   - DOWN is apple (7, 7).\n   \n   Between RIGHT and DOWN:\n   - RIGHT (8, 8): Puts me on the edge. I can only go DOWN (8, 7), UP (8, 9), or LEFT (7, 8).\n   - DOWN (7, 7): Puts me in the center/right. I can go DOWN (7, 6), LEFT (6, 7), RIGHT (8, 7), UP (7, 8).\n   \n   CENTER CONTROL is better than EDGE.\n   So DOWN (7, 7) is the better move if I am at (7, 8).\n   \n   **Wait, let's check the visual coordinates again.**\n   Row 8: `.

(Visual says `.` at x=6).\n   - (7, 8) is my head. (Visual says `T` at x=7).\n   - (8, 8) is empty. (Visual says `1` at x=8).\n   \n   This means the Visual is shifted.\n   If I move DOWN from (7, 8) to (7, 7):\n   - (7, 7) is an Apple (Visual confirms `A` at x=7, Row 7).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   \n   **Why is the visual shifted?**\n   Maybe the visual includes the apple at (8, 8) as `1`? No, that makes no sense.\n   \n   **Let's assume the Text is correct and the Visual has a slight display error or I am misinterpreting the indices.**\n   The Text is the game state.\n   The Visual is a map.\n   \n   **Move Analysis (Assuming Text State: Head 7, 8):**\n   1. UP (7, 9): Empty. Safe.\n   2. DOWN (7, 7): Apple. Safe. (Visual confirms `A` at x=7, y=7).\n   3. LEFT (6, 8): My Body. Dead.\n   4. RIGHT (8, 8): Empty (Visual shows `1` at x=8, but that must be wrong if I am at x=7). Or is it an apple?\n      Apple list says (8, 8) is an apple.\n      Visual says `1` at x=8.\n      If I am at (7, 8), (8, 8) is an apple.\n   \n   So both DOWN and RIGHT are apples.\n   \n   **Comparison: DOWN (7, 7) vs RIGHT (8, 8)**\n   - DOWN (7, 7): Central.

I have size 2, enemy has size 3.\n   However, being closer allows me to cut off his path.\n   \n   If I go DOWN (7, 7):\n   - I can threaten to move to (6, 7) or (5, 7).\n   - If I move to (6, 7), I block the column x=6.\n   - Enemy is at (5, 3).

It's an apple. It's central. It's aggressive.\n   \n   **Risk:**\n   Enemy moves simultaneously.\n   If Enemy moves UP (5, 4) -> Eats apple.\n   If Enemy moves LEFT (4, 3) -> Eats apple.\n   If Enemy moves DOWN (5, 2) -> Empty.\n   If Enemy moves RIGHT (6, 3) -> Dies.\n   \n   If Enemy moves UP, he is at (5, 4).\n   Distance to me at (7, 7) is |5-7| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   If Enemy moves DOWN, he is at (5, 2).\n   Distance is |5-7| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (7, 7), I am safe from collision.\n   \n   **Is there a trap?**\n   If I go RIGHT (8, 8):\n   - I am at (8, 8).\n   - I am safe.\n   - But I am not in the center.\n   \n   **Decision:**\n   I will move DOWN.\n   It gets me an apple.\n   It keeps me in the game for central control.\n   \n   Wait, let's check the visual again.\n   Row 8: `.

Move DOWN to (7, 7).\n   2. Eat apple.\n   3. Tie score 2-2.\n   4. Prepare to move Left or Down next turn to engage enemy.\n   \n   Wait, if I am at (7, 8) and I move DOWN, I go to (7, 7).\n   The Visual shows `A` at (7, 7).\n   This is consistent.\n   \n   What if I am actually at (8, 8) as the Visual suggests?\n   If I am at (8, 8), and I move DOWN, I go to (8, 7).\n   (8, 7) is empty.\n   I don't get an apple.\n   I stay at 1 apple. Enemy stays at 2.\n   \n   If the Text is wrong and Visual is right, I should probably move RIGHT to (9, 8) or DOWN to (8, 7).\n   But moving away from the center is bad.\n   \n   **Why is the Visual discrepancy there?**\n   \"Head: (7, 8)\"\n   \"Body: [(6, 8)]\"\n   Visual: `T` at x=7, `1` at x=8.\n   It looks like the visual just swapped the `T` and `1` symbols or shifted them.\n   If `1` was at x=7 and `T` at x=6, it would match the text.\n   \n   I will proceed based on the Text, as it is the explicit state description.\n   Move: DOWN.\n   Target: (7, 7).\n   \n   Wait, look at the Apple list again.\n   Apples: (7, 7).\n   If I move DOWN and I am at (7, 8), I get the apple.\n   \n   If I move RIGHT and I am at (7, 8), I get the apple at (8, 8).\n   \n   If I am at (8, 8) (Visual) and I move DOWN, I go to (8, 7). No apple.\n   \n   If the Visual is right, I am missing an apple opportunity.\n   But the Text says I am at (7, 8).\n   I have to trust the Text.\n   \n   Also, if I go DOWN, I am closer to the enemy.\n   If I go RIGHT, I am further.\n   The prompt says \"Be aggressive\".\n   Being closer to the enemy is aggressive.\n   \n   Let's go DOWN.\n\nOne more check.\nIs (7, 7) definitely safe?\nYes.\nIs (6, 8) my body?

Impossible. He is at (5, 3).\n\nSo DOWN is safe and optimal.\n\nOne final check on the visual.\nRow 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\nIf this is correct, `T` is at 7, `1` is at 8.\nIf `1` is at 8, and I move DOWN, I go to (8, 7).\n(8, 7) is empty.\nIf `1` is actually at 7 (and visual is misaligned), I go to (7, 7) (Apple).\nIf `1` is at 8 (and visual is correct), I go to (8, 7) (Empty).\nIf the Text is correct (Head 7, 8), then `1` is at 7.\nThe Visual shows `1` at 8.\nThe Visual is likely wrong about the `1` position or the `T` position.\nGiven the Enemy Visual was correct, let's assume My Visual is slightly shifted.\nIf `1` is at 7, `T` is at 6.\nThe visual string `. A . . . . . T 1 A .` has `T` at 7 and `1` at 8.\nIt's possible the string represents the board state *including* my tail at 7 and head at 8?\nBut the text says I just moved to (7, 8).\nThis is a confusing state.\nHowever, moving DOWN is the best \"center control\" move.\nIf I am at (7, 8), DOWN is (7, 7) (Apple).\nIf I am at (8, 8), DOWN is (8, 7) (Empty).\nIf I am at (8, 8) and I go DOWN, I lose momentum.\nIf I am at (7, 8) and I go DOWN, I gain momentum.\nThe Text is the \"Game Logic\" truth.\nThe Visual is the \"Display\" truth.\nI will trust the Game Logic.\n\nWait, look at the Apple list again.\nApples: (1, 6), (7, 7), (3, 5), (7, 0), (8, 8), (7, 4), (4, 3), (8, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4)\nBoth (7, 7) and (8, 8) are apples.\nIf I go DOWN (to 7, 7) or RIGHT (to 8, 8), I get an apple.\nThe position (7, 7) is better.\n\nI will choose DOWN.\n\nWait, I need to write the rationale.\n\"YO CHAT...\"\n\"DOWN\"\nLast word must be the move.\n\nLet's write the response.\n\nCheck:\n1.

Yes, empty/apple.\n\nBetween UP, DOWN, RIGHT:\nUP is a dead end (row 9).\nDOWN and RIGHT are both apples.\nDOWN is more central.\nDOWN is better.\n\nI am at (7, 8) (according to text).\nI go to (7, 7).\nScore becomes 2.\nLength becomes 3.\nCenter control secured.\n\nI will ignore the visual discrepancy and trust the text description of my coordinates, as it defines the simulation logic. The visual might just be slightly off or misaligned, but the apple locations in the text list are the source of truth for items.\n\nWait, the visual shows `T` at x=7.\nIf I am at (7, 8), my body is at (6, 8).\nThe visual shows `.` at x=6.\nSo the visual is definitely wrong about my body location.\nTherefore, I should trust the text.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move DOWN to (7, 7).\n2. Eat apple.\n3. Score tie.\n4. Control center.\n\nEnemy is at (5, 3). He is far.\nNo collision risk.\n\nFinal check:\nIf I go DOWN, do I trap myself?\nFrom (7, 7), I can go to (6, 7), (8, 7), (7, 6).\n(7, 8) will be my body (blocked).\nThis is good freedom.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 8):\nFrom (8, 8), I can go to (8, 7), (9, 8).\n(7, 8) will be my body (blocked).\nThis is restricted.\n\nDOWN is the move.\n\nI will provide the rationale and the move.\n\nOne detail: \"If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\nI am moving to (7, 7).\nIf the enemy moves to (7, 7) (Impossible, he is at 5,3).\nIf I move to (7, 7), and his tail moves to (7, 7) (Impossible, his tail is at 6,2).\n\nSafe.\n\nResponse structure:\n1. Greeting/Engagement.\n2. Analysis of current state.\n3. Elimination of bad moves (LEFT).\n4. Comparison of remaining moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n5. Decision (DOWN).\n6. Future plan.\n7. Move word.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nI should mention the enemy.\nEnemy is at (5, 3). Far away.\nI am safe to grab an apple.\n\n\"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nEating an apple allows me to grow.\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI don't have a higher score yet (1 vs 2).\nSo avoid collision, grow first.\n\n\"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score.\"\nI am behind, so I need to eat.\n\nThe move DOWN gets me an apple. This is good.\n\nLet's write it.\n\nOne minor thing.\nThe prompt says \"Last word must be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\".\nMake sure the final line is just the word.\n\n\"DOWN\" is the word.\n\nWait, is there any chance (7, 7) is blocked by the enemy?\nNo.\nIs there any chance (7, 7) is blocked by my body?\nNo.\n\nOkay, I'm confident.\n\nOne check on the visual text again.\nRow 8: `. A . . . . . T 1 A .`\nIf I am at (7, 8), I am `1`.\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (7, 7).\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nx=7 is `A`.\nThis confirms the apple is there.\n\nIf I am at (8, 8) (Visual), I am `1`.\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (8, 7).\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nx=8 is `.`.\nThis confirms no apple there.\n\nThe visual strongly implies I am at (8, 8).\nBut the text explicitly says (7, 8).\nThis is a conflict between \"Game Logic Text\" and \"Board Map Visual\".\nIn these scenarios, usually the explicit coordinate text is the ground truth for the simulation state, and the visual is a representation that might have artifacts or errors (like the `T` and `1` swapped or shifted).\nWhy? Because the text says \"Body: [(6, 8)]\".\nIf I were at (8, 8), my body would be at (7, 8).\nThe text says body is at (6, 8).\nTherefore, I am at (7, 8).\nThe visual is wrong about the positions of `T` and `1`.\nI will trust the text.\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\nWait, if I trust the text, and move DOWN.\nBut if the game engine uses the visual state (I am at 8,8), and I say DOWN.\nI go to (8, 7).\nI don't get an apple.\nI remain at 1 apple.\nEnemy gets apples.\nI lose.\nIf the game engine uses the text state (I am at 7, 8), and I say DOWN.\nI go to (7, 7).\nI get an apple.\nI win.\n\nI have to bet on the text being correct, because it's the description of the *state*.\nIf the visual was the state, the text would just be a summary of the visual.\nBut the text gives coordinates that contradict the visual.\nSo the text is the source of truth.\n\nI will proceed with DOWN.\n\nFinal check on UP.\nUP (7, 9) is empty.\nBut it's a dead end.\nI want to stay in the game.\nDOWN is better.\n\nFinal check on RIGHT.\nRIGHT (8, 8) is an apple.\nPosition (8, 8) is an edge.\nPosition (7, 7) is center.\nCenter > Edge.\nDOWN > RIGHT.\n\nDecision is solid.\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nDon't forget the emojis and the \"YO CHAT\" vibe.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Coordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the LEFT, increasing your x coordinate is to the RIGHT. Decreasing your y coordinate is DOWN, increasing your y coordinate is UP.\"\nThis is standard.\n\nFinal move: DOWN.\n\nOne last thought:\nThe enemy has 2 apples. I have 1.\nIf I eat an apple, I tie.\nIf I don't, I fall further behind.\nSo I *must* eat an apple if possible.\nFrom (7, 8), I can eat at (7, 7) or (8, 8).\nFrom (8, 8), I can eat at (7, 7) (if I go LEFT) but that's my body. Or (9, 8) (empty).\nSo if I am at (8, 8), I cannot eat an apple this turn (unless (9, 8) or (8, 7) is an apple, but they aren't).\nSo the text MUST be correct, otherwise I have no move to eat an apple and I will lose the score gap.\nThe game design usually gives options.\nSo (7, 7) and (8, 8) are apples.\nI am at (7, 8).\nI can go DOWN to (7, 7).\nI can go RIGHT to (8, 8).\nDOWN is better for center control.\nDOWN is the move.\n\nI'll add a note about the visual discrepancy in the rationale, just to show I noticed it, but that I'm trusting the game logic.\n\n\"YO CHAT! Let's check the board.\"\n...\n\"Visual says I'm at (8,8) but Text says (7,8).\"\n\"Trusting the game logic.\"\n\"DOWN is the move.\"\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it.\"\nI should avoid saying \"Then I will go Left\".\nJust describe the current move's benefits.\n\n\"Move DOWN to eat the apple at (7, 7) and secure center control.\"\nThat's good.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Word\" rule.\n\"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will put \"DOWN\" on its own line at the end.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nYO CHAT!

Let's break this down. \ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nI am at **(7, 7)** now (since I just ate that apple in the last turn).\nMy Body is at **[(7, 8), (6, 8)]**.\nMy score is **2**.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at **(5, 4)** (Head) with Body **[(5, 3), (6, 3)]**.\nEnemy score is **3**.\n\n**THE DANGER ZONE:**\nThe enemy is directly to my LEFT at (5, 4). They are one step higher in score.\nIf we collide head-on (e.g., I go LEFT to (6, 7) and they go DOWN to (5, 3)? No, wait.\nTheir head is at (5, 4). My head is at (7, 7).\nDistance is 2 cells.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 7), and they go **DOWN** to (5, 3)? No, that's not collision.\nCollision happens if we swap spots or land on the same cell.\nI am at (7, 7). They are at (5, 4).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (6, 7), I am safe.\nBUT, looking at the board, there is an Apple at **(2, 4)**.\nThe enemy is at (5, 4). They are on the same row!\nThey are likely to chase that apple (6, 4 -> 7, 4... wait, (6, 4) is empty? No, (6, 3) is their body.\nIf they go RIGHT, they hit their own body at (6, 3)? No, their head is (5, 4). Neck is (5, 3).\nSo they can go RIGHT to (6, 4).\nIf they go RIGHT to (6, 4), and I go LEFT to (6, 7), we are getting closer.\n**If I go LEFT, I am moving INTO their hunting ground.**\n\n**MY SURVIVAL CHECKS:**\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 7):**\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? My body is (7, 8) and (6, 8). (6, 7) is safe.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy is at (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3). Safe.\n    *   **Is it a trap?** I am moving closer to the enemy. If they are heading for the apple at (2, 4), they might sweep across the board. If I move Left, I am on the intercept course.\n    *   **Future moves from (6, 7):** I can go UP (6, 8) -> CRASH (My tail moves, but (6, 8) is currently occupied by my body? Yes, (6, 8) is my tail. I can't go there. **Wait.** If I go Left to (6, 7), my body moves from (7, 8) to (7, 7) and (6, 8) to (7, 8).\n        *   If I am at (6, 7), my body is [(7, 7), (7, 8)].\n        *   Next turn, UP to (6, 8) would be valid! (Since my tail is now at (7, 8)).\n    *   However, (6, 7) is near the center wall. It restricts my Left/Right freedom eventually.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** I am at (7, 7). Right side is more open.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** There is an Apple at **(8, 8)**.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (8, 7), I am *under* the apple at (8, 8).\n    *   Next turn, I can go **UP** to (8, 8) and eat the apple!\n    *   This keeps me on the Right side, away from the enemy (who is on the Left/Middle).\n    *   This secures the Right flank.\n\n3.  **UP to (7, 8):**\n    *   Is it my body? YES! My body is currently [(7, 8), (6, 8)].\n    *   **DEAD.** Don't do it.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 6):**\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** (7, 6) is empty.\n    *   Apples: (7, 4) is below. (8, 2) is far down.\n    *   This moves me down, but keeps me in the same column.\n    *   However, the enemy is at (5, 4). They might go Down to (5, 3) or Left/Right.\n    *   Moving Down is safe, but RIGHT gives me a clear path to the apple at (8, 8) which is *guaranteed* food.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to secure points. The enemy has 3. I have 2.\nI see an apple at (8, 8). It is safe.\nTo get it, I must move to (8, 7) first (or (8, 9) but that's a detour).\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8, 7) sets up a guaranteed eat on Turn 7.\nMoving Left or Down risks engaging the enemy or just wandering.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the apple at (8, 8) on the next turn. Dominate the right side of the board to avoid the enemy's patrol zone on the left. Don't let them trap us in the middle.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI'm going **RIGHT** to set up the apple grab.\n\nDOWN\n\nWait, I said RIGHT in my thought process. Why did I type DOWN?\nLet me re-read.\n\"Moving RIGHT to (8, 7) sets up a guaranteed eat on Turn 7.\"\n\"Move: I'm going RIGHT.\"\n\nLet me double check the DOWN move.\nDOWN to (7, 6). From there, I can go DOWN to (7, 5). Then (7, 4) has an apple.\nPath: (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4).\nThat's 3 turns to get an apple.\nPath Right: (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 8).\nThat's 1 turn to get an apple.\nRIGHT is mathematically better.\n\nWhy did I type DOWN? A typo in my thought draft.\nI must output the correct word.\n\n**MOVE: RIGHT**",

It must have been eaten by the enemy or just vanished? No, wait. The apple list shows (8, 8) was a drop. Did the enemy eat it? No, enemy is at (4, 4).\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\n`9 . . . A . . . . . .`\n`8 . A . . . . . T A .`\n`7 . . . . . . A T 1 .`\nThe apple at (8, 8) is NOT on the board state visual. It must have been eaten or the visual is missing it? Wait, the visual shows `T` and `A` and `1`.\nLet's look at row 8: `. A . . . . . T A .`\nCoordinates: (0,8) to (9,8).\n(1,8) is A.\n(7,8) is T (My body).\n(8,8) is A.\nOkay, the apple at (8, 8) **IS** there in the visual!\nMy head is at (8, 7).\n**I can eat the apple at (8, 8) by moving UP.**\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (8, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** Apple at (8, 8).\n    *   **Safety:** My body is at (7, 7) and (7, 8). (8, 8) is empty. Enemy is at (4, 4).\n    *   **Outcome:** I eat the apple. Score becomes 3. I grow.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (4, 4). They see apples at (3, 9), (6, 7), (7, 4), etc. They are far away.\n    *   **Verdict:** **HIGH VALUE.** Matches score. Secures the apple right in front of my face.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 7) is on the board.\n    *   **Outcome:** I miss the apple. I'm on the edge.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but why move away from food? I want to box the enemy in, not run to the wall.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 7) is currently my body (specifically, the segment after my head).\n    *   **Outcome:** **DEATH.** I would crash into my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** I move down. I miss the apple at (8, 8).\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but passive. I lose the chance to tie the score immediately.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe enemy has 3 apples, I have 2. I need to tie this up NOW.\nThe apple at (8, 8) is free real estate. No body is blocking it. No immediate threat.\nIf I take it, we are tied 3-3, and I have growth on the right side of the map, isolating me from the enemy who is lurking on the left/center.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nCould the enemy predict this? Possibly.\nCould they reach (8, 8) this turn? No, they are at (4, 4). Max movement is 1 square.\nIs there a head-on collision risk? Only if they move to (8, 8), which is impossible.\nIs there a trap? No.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI am going **UP** to eat the apple and tie the score.\n\nUP",

We tied it up! \ud83d\udc0d)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 4 (Snake #0 is still one up, but we're closing in.)\n*   **My Head:** (8, 8)\n*   **My Body:** [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 4) \u2014 He's on the left side, lurking.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nI just ate the apple at (8, 8). I'm at the top-right corner. I see a new apple at **(1, 8)** on the top row. That's a long run, but it's open highway if I stick to the top.\nHowever, looking at the immediate board, there's an apple at **(7, 4)**. That's actually closer in terms of Manhattan distance (4 steps down), but the top row is wide open and I can cut off the board horizontally.\nWait, looking at the board state, there is an apple at **(1, 8)** on the top row. That's directly accessible if I move Left along the top edge. That's my priority.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (8, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):**\n    *   **Target:** Wall. No apple.\n    *   **Safety:** It's a wall.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** Don't hit the wall, chat!\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** I move to the edge. I'm boxing myself in on the right. I want to move Left to chase apples.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe but limiting. I lose access to the left side of the board.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (8, 7) is currently my body (the segment right below my head).\n    *   **Outcome:** **DEATH.** I would crash into my own body. Can't go back down immediately.\n    *   **Verdict:** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** Opens up the path to the apple at (1, 8) and (2, 8). Also puts me closer to the apple at (7, 3) if I decide to dive down later.\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 8) is currently my tail! My body is [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]. So (7, 8) is the very last segment.\n    *   **Outcome:** I move into the spot where my tail *currently* is. But remember, in Snake, the tail moves away *at the same time* I move. So if I move Left to (7, 8), my tail will move from (7, 8) to (7, 7), leaving (7, 8) empty for my head.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This opens up the entire top row. I can start zig-zagging or cutting across the board to dominate the territory. The enemy is at (3, 4), so the top is relatively safe for now.\n    *   **Verdict:** **OPTIMAL.** I maintain my length, stay safe, and open up the board to hunt apples and cut off the enemy.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nThe enemy is far away at (3, 4). They aren't threatening my top-right corner. Moving Left is the only way to actually *play* the game instead of getting stuck in a corner. I'm moving towards apples (1, 8) and (2, 3). I'm extending my reach.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI am going **LEFT** to (7, 8). The tail moves, the head moves, we stay alive and we stay hunting.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake is hanging out at (3, 5), planning its next move. We need to play smart and aggressive. We're at (7, 8) after moving Left last turn. We didn't get an apple (sad face), but we didn't die (happy face).\n\nLet's check the board.\n**Current Head:** (7, 8)\n**Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)] (Wait, looking at the board state, my body is actually at [(8,8), (8,7), (7,7)]? No, wait. Last turn I was at (8,8). I moved Left to (7,8). My previous body was [(8,8), (8,7), (7,7)]. Wait, the board state shows my tail at (7,8) in Turn 8?\nLet's re-read the Board State from the prompt.\nBoard 9:\n```\n 9 . . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . A . . . . A 1 T .\n 7 . . . . . . A T T .\n 6 .

At (7,8) there is a '1'. That means my head is at (7,8).\nWhere is my body? The board shows 'T's for tails? Or maybe those are just empty or enemy? The prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL\". The prompt gave:\n`YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1): Head: (7, 8), Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)]`\nWait, if my head is at (7,8), and my body includes (7,7), that means my tail is at (7,7)? No, the list is Head -> ... -> Tail. So:\nHead: (7, 8)\nBody segment 1: (8, 8)\nBody segment 2: (8, 7)\nBody segment 3 (Tail): (7, 7)\n\nSo my body occupies: (8,8), (8,7), (7,7).\nCurrent Head: (7,8).\nLet's look at the Board State again.\nAt (8,8) there is a 'T' in the board state? No, at row 8 (y=8), col 8 (x=8): The board shows `A 1 T .`.\nLet's map it out.\nRow 8: `. A . . . .

No. (My body is (8,8), (8,7), (7,7)).\n*   Is it occupied by Enemy? No.\n*   Verdict: **OPTIMAL.** It's an apple! We need apples to catch up to snake #0 (5 apples vs our 3). Plus, moving Left keeps us in the game towards the apples at (1,8) and (2,3).\n\nWait, looking at the board state again for (6,8). It says `A`.\nAlso (1,8) says `A`.\nAlso (6,7) says `A`.\nAlso (4,3) and (2,3) and (7,0)...\n\nLet's look at the long-term plan. I want to dominate the board.\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) eats an apple.\nIf I eat an apple, I grow. My tail won't move this turn.\nMy new length will be 5.\nMy head will be at (6,8).\nMy body will be [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7)].\nWait, if I eat an apple, I don't pop the tail. So my body becomes (current head (7,8) becomes body, then old body...)\nSo: Head (6,8) -> Body (7,8) -> Body (8,8) -> Body (8,7) -> Tail (7,7).\n\nIs (6,8) safe from the enemy moving into my tail or head?\nEnemy is at (3,5). He is far away. He has a length of 6 (Head + 5 body).\nHe might move towards the cluster of apples at (4,3), (2,3), (1,1)? Or maybe (7,3)? There are apples everywhere.\nThe enemy is at (3,5).\nIf he moves UP (3,6), RIGHT (4,5), DOWN (3,4 - wait, he has body at (3,4)), or LEFT (2,5).\n(3,4) is his body. So he can't go DOWN.\n(2,5) is empty.\n(3,6) is empty (Row 6 shows `. A . . . . . . . .` -> (3,6) is `.`).\n(4,5) is empty.\n\nI need to eat this apple at (6,8). It's right there. It gives me +1 point.\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I am safe, but I miss the apple. The apple might get eaten by... no one? There are no other snakes near (6,8). But I am giving up a point. I need points to win.\nSnake #0 has 5 apples. I have 3.\nIf I eat this, I get 4. Still behind, but closer.\nIf I don't eat, I stay at 3.\nI should eat.\n\nIs there any risk?\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I am moving into an empty cell (filled with apple).\nThe only risk is if the enemy crashes into me.\nHe is at (3,5). To crash into me at (6,8), he would need to be close. He isn't.\nHe could theoretically crash into my tail (7,7) if he moves rapidly? No, he's at x=3.\nHe could crash into my body (7,8) or (8,8)? No.\n\nSo, EAT THE APPLE.\nThis moves me closer to the center/top-left area. From (6,8), I can continue Left to (5,8) or (4,8) or (3,8) or (2,8). Or Down to (6,7) (which also has an apple!).\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 8: `. A . . . . A 1 T .`\nRow 7: `. . . . . . A T T .`\nI am at (7,8). Apple at (6,8) and (6,7).\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8) and eat:\nNext turn I am at (6,8). My body will be (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7).\nFrom (6,8) I can go DOWN to (6,7) which is an apple.\nOr LEFT to (5,8).\nOr UP to (6,9).\n\nIf I go UP to (7,9):\nI miss the apple. I am at (7,9). My body becomes (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7) (tail moves).\nFrom (7,9) I can go DOWN (back to 7,8), LEFT (6,9), or RIGHT (8,9).\n(6,9) is empty (Row 9 shows `. . . A . . . . . .` -> (6,9) is `.`).\n(8,9) is empty.\nI am safe, but I am not scoring. The enemy is scoring (he has more apples).\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nThe enemy has 5 apples. I have 3. I need to close the gap. The apple at (6,8) is free real estate. I take it. Then I can look at (6,7) next. I am essentially clearing the top-right quadrant. The enemy is bottom-left/center. I can box him out of the top if I keep moving left/up.\n\nOne detail: I need to be careful about the move *after* this one.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8) and eat:\nMy body is (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7).\nIf I then go DOWN to (6,7) (which has an apple), is (6,7) safe?\n(6,7) is currently an apple. It is not occupied by my body (My body is at x >= 7).\nSo DOWN is safe next turn.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,8) next turn, is (5,8) safe?\n(5,8) is empty.\nSo options are open.\n\nLet's verify the \"Death\" conditions again for LEFT.\nTarget (6,8).\nBoard state: `A`. Not a wall.\nMy body: (8,8), (8,7), (7,7). (6,8) is not in there.\nWait, (7,8) is my *current head*. The *next* head will be (6,8).\nThe *current* body includes (7,8)? No, the body list provided is [(8,8), (8,7), (7,7)]. It does NOT include (7,8) yet because (7,8) is the head.\nSo the cells occupied by me *before* moving are: Head (7,8), Body (8,8), (8,7), (7,7).\nIf I move to (6,8), I am leaving (7,8).\nSo (6,8) is empty of my own body.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy Head (3,5).\nIf he moves RIGHT (4,5), he is at (4,5). Far away.\nIf he moves UP (3,6), (3,6). Far away.\nHe cannot reach (6,8) this turn.\n\nSo, LEFT is the move. It scores a point. It keeps me alive. It opens up the board.\n\nOne check: Is there a reason to go UP to (7,9)?\nMaybe to avoid a future trap? But scoring is important to win.\nAlso, (6,8) is actually a better position to move down to (6,7) next turn (another apple).\nIf I go UP to (7,9), next turn I can go LEFT to (6,9) (empty) or DOWN to (7,8) (which will be empty by then, but leads back to where I came from).\nSo LEFT seems strictly better for apple collection and board control.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**Rationale:**\nYO CHAT! Turn 9 check-in. We are at (7,8). The enemy is at (3,5), safely on the other side of the board. He has 5 apples, we have 3. We need to eat!\nLooking at the board, there is a juicy apple waiting for us at **(6, 8)**. It's literally right next to my head.\nLet's check the moves:\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** Safe, but misses the apple. We fall further behind.\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Death. That's my body.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** Death. That's my body.\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** **OPTIMAL.** It's an apple! It's safe (no enemy, no wall, no self). It gives us a point, bringing us to 4 apples, closing the gap to 5-4.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTake the apple. From (6, 8), I'm looking at the board. There's another apple at (6, 7) directly below me. If I eat (6, 8) now, I can likely eat (6, 7) next turn. I'm sweeping the top-right corner, collecting points while the enemy is stuck in the bottom-left. By the time he realizes, I'll be ready to box him in. Never give up free food, chat!\n\n**Move:**\nI am going **LEFT** to (6, 8). Let's get that apple!\n\nLEFT",

He cannot reach (6, 7) this turn. Even if he sprints, he's 3-4 turns away.\n    *   **Consequence:** I eat the apple! I grow to **5 apples**.

We are only one point behind. We need to close that gap and eventually take the lead.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- My Head: (6, 7)\n- My Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n- Score: 5 vs 6 (We are trailing, but closing in!)\n\n**Enemy Status:**\n- Head: (2, 4)\n- Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n- He's still down in the bottom-left quadrant. We are dominating the top-right.\n\n**Available Apples (Top Candidates):**\n- (6, 5) - Directly below us. 2 turns away.\n- (7, 3) - Good position.\n- (2, 3) - Close to enemy.\n- (8, 4) - Top right.\n- (3, 9) - Top middle.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. Check UP to (6, 8):**\n- **Safety Check:** (6, 8) is currently my body (the segment right behind my head). If I go UP, I move into my own body. **DEAD**.\n- **Verdict:** \u274c **SUICIDE.**\n\n**2. Check RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n- **Safety Check:** (7, 7) is also part of my body. Specifically, it's the tail.\n- **Movement Rule:** Moving back into your own tail is allowed *if* the tail moves away on the same turn. However, in this configuration, (7, 7) is connected to (8, 7) and (7, 8). If I move to (7, 7), I am effectively turning 90 degrees into my own body segment.\n- **Verdict:** \u274c **CRASH INTO SELF.**\n\n**3. Check LEFT to (5, 7):**\n- **Safety Check:** (5, 7) is currently empty on the board.\n- **Enemy Check:** Enemy is far away at (2, 4). No risk of head-on collision.\n- **Body Check:** (5, 7) is not part of my body.\n- **Future Options:**\n    - From (5, 7), I can go **DOWN** to (5, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4)... wait, (5, 4) is enemy body. Danger zone.\n    - From (5, 7), I can go **LEFT** to (4, 7) -> (3, 7) -> (2, 7)... open space.\n    - From (5, 7), I can go **UP** to (5, 8) -> (5, 9)... open space.\n    - From (5, 7), I can go **RIGHT** back to (6, 7) (my head will be gone, so it's the tail).\n- **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE.**\n\n**4. Check DOWN to (6, 6):**\n- **Safety Check:** (6, 6) is empty.\n- **Enemy Check:** No immediate threat.\n- **Future Options:**\n    - From (6, 6), I can go **DOWN** to (6, 5). **There is an apple at (6, 5)!** \ud83c\udf4e\n    - From (6, 6), I can go **LEFT** to (5, 6).\n    - From (6, 6), I can go **RIGHT** to (7, 6).\n- **Strategic Value:** This move positions me to grab the apple at (6, 5) next turn. This is the closest apple to me.\n- **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE & AGGRESSIVE (Towards Apple).**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are on the hunt. We are trailing by 1 point (5 vs 6). We need to eat to tie or take the lead. The apple at (6, 5) is low-hanging fruit. Moving **DOWN** to (6, 6) puts us directly above it. We maintain control of the right side of the board and prepare to grow.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN now. Next turn, move DOWN again to (6, 5) to eat the apple. We tie the score 6-6 and grow our length. We keep the pressure on the enemy while safely farming the right side.\n\n**Move:**\nI am moving **DOWN** to position for the apple!\n\nDOWN",
