Who\u2019s ready for some chaos? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick read-through (thinking out loud for the stream):\n- Our head: (7,6). Opponent head: (5,3). No bodies anywhere \u2014 clean slate.\n- Apples nearby: (7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (7,9) \u2014 a sweet cluster to our north/northeast. Yum. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDecision process (step-by-step, per the playbook):\n1) Check all four moves:\n   - UP -> (7,7): apple present. Safe from immediate collision (opponent cannot reach that cell this turn). Will give us +1 apple and a body segment behind us at (7,6).\n   - RIGHT -> (8,6): empty, safe but no immediate apple.\n   - LEFT -> (6,6): empty, safe.\n   - DOWN -> (7,5): empty, safe.\n\n2) Eliminate deadly moves: none of the four are instant-death (we have no body to hit, not at the edge). No move is backwards into our body (we have no body). Opponent is too far for any head-on into our intended UP cell.\n\n3) Tactical preference: we want apples and to keep options open. UP gets an apple and places us right into the apple-rich corridor (7,x and 8,x). That both grows us (more control) and opens multiple follow-up moves (we can go up to keep snatching apples or sidestep). Also gives us a 1\u20130 edge, making a future head-on more favorable if he ever tries to ram us. Aggressive and safe = WIN.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns (for the replay viewer & future me):\n- Grab (7,7) now. Then prioritize (7,8)/(8,8)/(7,9) to chain apples and build length near the top-right. Pressure the center from above; if the opponent comes north to contest, force a head-on if we have more apples. Avoid getting funneled into tight columns; keep lateral escape space (esp. via x=6..9).\n\nLet\u2019s get that first apple and start boxing him in \u2014 you know the plan. Ready? Let\u2019s gooooo! \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udfc1\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "LET'S GOOOO CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE and ready to box out the enemy! Turn 0, let's set the tone. Board is 10x10, apples are scattered, but we don't care about apples yet\u2014we care about DOMINATING the board and trapping Snake #0!\n\nFirst up: **Scouting the board and enemies.**  \n- My head is at (5, 3) with no body. Clean slate, baby!  \n- Enemy snake #0 head is at (7, 6), also no body. We're even in score and length.  \n- Apples: 15 of them! But I'm ignoring them for now. Focus on positioning to force a collision or block the enemy.  \n\n**Board visualization (from my perspective):**  \n- Top rows: 9 has an apple at (7,8), 8 has apples at (7,8) and (8,8), 7 has apples at (4,7) and (7,7), 6 has apples at (1,6) and (4,6), 5 has apple at (5,2), 4 has apples at (1,4) and (7,4), 3 has apple at (8,3), 2 has apples at (0,2) and (5,2), 1 has apples at (6,1) and (4,1), 0 has none.  \n- Key: Enemy at (7,6) is near apples at (7,7), (8,8), (7,4). My head at (5,3) is central. I need to close in.  \n\n**Decision Process:**  \n1. **Check all directions for immediate death:**  \n   - **UP** to (5,4): On board, no own body (empty), no enemy body (enemy body empty). SAFE.  \n   - **DOWN** to (5,2): On board, no own body, no enemy body. BUT (5,2) is an apple! SAFE, and if I eat it, I grow.  \n   - **LEFT** to (4,3): On board, no own body, no enemy body. SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT** to (6,3): On board, no own body, no enemy body. SAFE.  \n   All moves are safe\u2014no immediate deaths. No head-on collision risk this turn since enemy might move unpredictably.  \n\n2. **Among safe moves, favor those that:**  \n   - Increase chance to eat apples? Yes, but we prioritize dominating space and keeping options open.  \n   - Keep future options OPEN? Absolutely\u2014avoid corners or tight spaces.  \n   - Move CLOSER to reachable apples? Apples at (5,2) is down, (4,7) is up-left, (7,4) is right-up.  \n   - Avoid likely head-on collisions? Enemy is at (7,6). If I move right toward (6,3), I'm getting closer to enemy's potential path. But we want to force collisions if we have higher score\u2014we're tied 0-0, so not yet. Better to position aggressively.  \n\n   Evaluating:  \n   - DOWN to (5,2): Gets an apple +1 growth, central, keeps options open (can go up, left, right later). But apple is a distraction\u2014content is good, but we want to box enemy.  \n   - LEFT to (4,3): Moves left toward (4,7) apple, away from enemy slightly, opens paths upward and left. Good for controlling space.  \n   - UP to (5,4): Directly toward center, potential to cut off enemy if he goes for (7,4) or (4,7).  \n   - RIGHT to (6,3): Closer to enemy at (7,6), but risky if enemy moves left-down to (6,5) and we collide next turn.  \n\n   Best for aggression: **UP** or **LEFT**.  \n   - If I go UP to (5,4), I threaten the center and can pivot to cut off enemy's access to apples on right/top.  \n   - If I go LEFT to (4,3), I start boxing him in from the left, forcing him right into corners.  \n\n   Long-term plan: Enemy is at (7,6) with apples at (7,7) and (7,8) nearby. If I move UP to (5,4), next turn I can go RIGHT to (6,4) or UP to (5,5) to close in. This positions me to force a head-on collision if he heads left or blocks his escape. Goal: Trap him in the right side (x=7-9) and grow by snaking around. Since we're even, once we eat an apple and grow, we can push for collision.  \n\n   Rhetorical for chat: Why stay low when we can take the high ground and rain down pressure? Do we want to chase apples or chase victory? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51  \n\n   Chosen move: **UP** to (5,4). Opens upward paths, keeps multiple options (right, left, up next), and moves toward center to dominate. Avoids immediate apple temptation to stay focused on positioning.  \n\nPlan for future: Move UP now to secure center, then watch enemy move\u2014if he goes for (7,7), I close in from (6,4) next to block. Grow when safe, but always advance on his territory. Let's box him in!  \n\nUP",

Last move we went UP to (5,4), securing the center and avoiding that tempting apple at (5,2). Good call\u2014apples are content, but DOMINANCE is king. Now, let's check the board and plot our next aggressive move.  \n\n**Scouting the Current State:**  \n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5,4), no body yet (perfect\u2014we're agile). Apples: 0.  \n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (7,7), body at (7,6), apples: 1. Score: 0 vs. 1\u2014they're ahead, but we're tied in length. No head-on risk this turn since we're distant.  \n- **Board Visualization:** Apples everywhere, but we ignore them for now. Key areas:  \n  - Enemy is in the top-right (x=7-9, y=6-7), near apples at (7,8), (8,8), (7,9). He's hungry.  \n  - We're central at (5,4), with apples at (4,7) up-left, (7,4) right, (5,2) down (but we skipped it), and more scattered.  \n  - Our body is empty, so no self-collision worries.  \n- **Goal:** Box out the enemy! He's on the right side; we need to push left/up to cut off his escape and force him into a corner. Grow when safe to boost score for collisions.  \n\n**Decision Process:**  \n1. **Check all directions for immediate death (Rule #2: Stay alive!):**  \n   - **UP to (5,5):** On board (y=5 \u2264 9). No own body (empty). Enemy body is at (7,6)\u2014not (5,5). SAFE.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,3):** On board (y=3 \u2265 0). No own body. Enemy body at (7,6)\u2014not (5,3). SAFE. (Plus, we came from (5,3) last turn\u2014moving back is allowed since body is empty! No \"backwards into own body\" risk.)  \n   - **LEFT to (4,4):** On board (x=4 \u2265 0). No own body. Enemy body at (7,6)\u2014not (4,4). SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,4):** On board (x=6 \u2264 9). No own body. Enemy body at (7,6)\u2014not (6,4). SAFE. (Close to enemy, but not adjacent yet.)  \n\n   All moves are SAFE\u2014no deaths. Enemy moves simultaneously, so we can't predict, but we're not in immediate collision path (enemy likely goes for apples like (8,8) or (7,9)).  \n\n2. **Among SAFE moves, favor aggression and future options (Rules: Increase apple chances + keep paths open):**  \n   - **UP to (5,5):** Moves deeper into center, toward apples at (4,7) and (6,5). Opens up upward/rightward paths. Great for boxing enemy from the north\u2014next we can go RIGHT to (6,5) or LEFT to (4,5) to flank. Multiple options: 3+ safe moves ahead.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,3):** Retreats to previous spot\u2014wastes momentum. We'd lose center control and narrow options (can only go up, left, right, but we'd be looping back). Not aggressive.  \n   - **LEFT to (4,4):** Starts boxing enemy from the left. Good for cutting off his left escape, but slightly less central. Paths: Up to (4,5), down to (4,3), right back. Still solid, but enemy is right-side focused.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,4):** Moves toward enemy territory\u2014risky if he heads left-down to (6,6) next turn, potential head-on if we both go wrong. High reward (closer to apples at (7,4)), but we're even score, so avoid collisions for now.  \n\n   **Why UP?** It's the power move! We're at (5,4); going UP to (5,5) claims the high ground, threatens to dominate the middle, and forces enemy to react. If he goes for (7,8), we can next move RIGHT to (6,5) and start encircling. Keeps options WIDE OPEN (up, left, right, even down if needed)\u2014no corners here. Aggression without overextending. Chat, we're not chasing apples; we're chasing VICTORY! Why settle for down when up means we rain pressure? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25  \n\n   **Long-term Plan:** Push center \u2192 Right-flank enemy \u2192 Grow on safe apples (e.g., (4,7) if path clears) \u2192 Force collision once we hit +1 apple. Box him into top-right dead-end by turn 10. Watch his moves\u2014 if he's greedy, we trap. Let's GOOO!  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nUP",

With more apples, head-on collisions become a win condition for us \u2014 we can threaten rams and bully the opponent.\n- LEFT moves toward the enemy but gives up an easy apple and isn\u2019t necessary right now.

We need to box him in and force mistakes. Let's break it down!\n\n**Current State Check:**  \n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5,5), no body. Apples: 0.  \n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (7,8), body at [(7,7), (7,6)]. Apples: 2. Score is 0 vs 2\u2014we're behind but equal length (1 vs 3 segments, but he's grown twice). No immediate head-on risk, but he's in top-right corner hungry.  \n- **Board:** Apples everywhere, but we ignore them. Enemy is near (8,8) and (7,9); he might go RIGHT to (8,8) or UP to (7,9). We're central at (5,5). Key threat: if we both rush right, we could collide.  \n- **Goal:** Dominate the center, cut off his left escape, grow only when safe. Force him into the top-right dead-end. Don't chase apples\u2014chase VICTORY!\n\n**Decision Process (Rule #2: Stay Alive First):**  \n1. **Eliminate deadly moves:**  \n   - **UP to (5,6):** On board (y=6 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy bodies at (7,7)/(7,6)\u2014not (5,6). SAFE.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,4):** On board (y=4 \u2265 0). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. SAFE (we came from (5,4) last turn\u2014allowed since no body).  \n   - **LEFT to (4,5):** On board (x=4 \u2265 0). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,5):** On board (x=6 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. But this brings us closer to enemy's path\u2014potential future head-on if he heads left-down. Risky for now since score is even; avoid collisions until we lead.  \n   All moves safe\u2014no deaths this turn.  \n\n2. **Favor aggression and future options (keep paths OPEN, box enemy):**  \n   - **UP to (5,6):** Claims the north, positioning to flank enemy from above. Opens paths to (4,6), (6,6), (5,7). Great for boxing enemy's left side if he stays top-right. Multiple options ahead.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,4):** Retreats\u2014loses center control. Options narrow (loop back up or sideways). Not aggressive.  \n   - **LEFT to (4,5):** Starts left flank to cut off enemy's escape. Solid, but slightly less central than UP. Paths good, but UP is better for overall board control.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,5):** Tempting to pressure enemy, but too risky head-on potential. Save for later when we have more apples.  \n\n**Why UP?** We're at (5,5); going UP to (5,6) elevates our game\u2014literally! It threatens the top-middle, forces enemy to react, and keeps us central. If he grabs (8,8) or (7,9), we can next move RIGHT to (6,6) and close the net. No corners, wide options (up/left/right). Aggression without overcommitting. Chat, we're not settling for scraps\u2014we're taking the board! Why stay low when we can dominate high? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Long-term Plan:** From (5,6), next move RIGHT to (6,6) to flank enemy's left. Then push up to (6,7) or (5,7) to box top-right. Grow only on safe apples like (4,7) if path clear. Aim to trap enemy by turn 10, then force collision once we hit +1 apple. Watch his moves\u2014if greedy, we snare! Let's GOOO!\n\nUP",

The enemy snake #0 is at (6,8) with body (7,8) and (7,7) (looking at the board: \"0\" at (6,8), \"T\" at (7,8) and (7,7)). They've got two apples and are camping the top-right corner near apples like (8,8) and (7,9). Meanwhile, we're at (5,6) with no body\u2014clean slate, perfect for aggression. Apples are scattered, but we ignore the fruit and focus on boxing him in. He's growing faster, so we need to cut off his escape routes and force a mistake. If we can trap him in the top-right dead-end, he'll crash out or starve. Let's stay alive first, then dominate.\n\n**Current State Check:**  \n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5,6), no body. Apples: 0.  \n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (6,8), body at [(7,8), (7,7)]. Apples: 2.  \n- **Board:** 10x10 from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. We're at y=6, enemy at y=8. Key apples nearby: (5,7) and (6,7) are close to him; we have (6,1), (5,2), etc. down low, but we're not chasing\u2014hunting the snake. Enemy could move RIGHT to (7,8) or UP to (6,9) or LEFT to (5,8) or DOWN to (6,7). We're positioned to intercept.\n\n**Decision Process (Rule #2: Stay Alive First):**  \n1. **Eliminate deadly moves:**  \n   - **UP to (5,7):** On board (y=7 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy bodies at (7,8)/(7,7)\u2014(5,7) is clear. SAFE (no immediate death).  \n   - **DOWN to (5,5):** On board (y=5 \u2265 0). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. SAFE (but we came from (5,5) last turn\u2014backwards into own empty body is fine).  \n   - **LEFT to (4,6):** On board (x=4 \u2265 0). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,6):** On board (x=6 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy bodies not there. SAFE.  \n   All moves are safe\u2014no deaths this turn. Good, we have options!\n\n2. **Favor aggression and future options (keep paths OPEN, box enemy):**  \n   - **UP to (5,7):** Aggressive push north! Gets us closer to enemy's domain\u2014threatens his potential moves to (6,7) or (5,8). From (5,7), we have up to (5,8), right to (6,7), left to (4,7), down to (5,6). Opens the top-middle, positions to flank his left if he goes right. Solid for boxing: if he's greedy for (8,8), we can cut him off. But risky if he heads left\u2014could lead to head-on if we both go wrong. Still, it's forward momentum.  \n   - **DOWN to (5,5):** Retreats\u2014loses ground. From (5,5), options are up to (5,6), down to (5,4), left to (4,5), right to (6,5). Narrowing our field, not aggressive. We're giving up the north to the enemy? No way, chat\u2014we're predators!  \n   - **LEFT to (4,6):** Starts building the left wall. Positions to block enemy's escape if he retreats south. From (4,6), options: up (4,7), down (4,5), right (5,6), left (3,6). Safe and expanding, but doesn't directly pressure enemy yet.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,6):** Moves toward enemy's left side. From (6,6), we can go up to (6,7) next, right to (7,6), left to (5,6), down to (6,5). This sets up to flank and potentially force a collision if we grow. But heading right too early might lead to head-on if enemy moves down to (6,7). Since we're behind in score, we need to play smart\u2014avoid direct clashes until we're up.  \n\n**Why UP?** We're at (5,6), and going UP to (5,7) is the bold play! It elevates us right into the enemy's shadow, threatening his space and forcing him to react. If he goes for an apple like (6,7) or (8,8), we're in position to next move RIGHT to (6,7) and box him in from below. From (5,7), we control the vertical axis\u2014wide options up/left/right to close the net on the top-right corner. Staying low or sideways feels passive; we need to dominate the board height early. Chat, zero apples? That's just fuel\u2014let's climb up and make him sweat! Why hug the floor when we can own the sky? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Long-term Plan:** From (5,7), next move RIGHT to (6,7) to cut off his path down. Then push UP to (6,8) if he's clear, or LEFT to (5,8) to trap. Grow on safe apples like (7,9) if we can grab it without risk. Aim to force him into (7,9)/(8,9) dead-end by turn 8. Once we snag one apple, we go for head-on collision\u2014he's got 2, we need to match and overtake. Watch his body; if he moves into our future path, we kill him.

Enemy snake #0 is lurking at (5,8) with body (6,8) and (7,8), trapping himself in that top-right corner. We're at (5,7), fresh and hungry. No apples for us yet? No biggie\u2014we're hunting bodies, not fruit! Let's box him in and force a crash. Remember, simultaneous moves mean we gotta predict his path: if he goes for (5,9) or (6,9), we cut him off. If he dips down, we chase. Aggression mode: ON.\n\n**Decision Process (Keep It Alive, Dominate the Field):**  \n1. **All Moves Check:**  \n   - **UP to (5,8):** On board? Yes (y=8 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy body? (6,8) and (7,8)\u2014(5,8) is currently \"0\" (enemy head!) Wait no, board shows \"0\" at (6,8)? Hold up, recheck board: \"0\" at (6,8), but turn says head at (5,8). Board visual might be misaligned, but from info, enemy head is (5,8). Moving UP into (5,8) would hit enemy head directly\u2014HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die? But we're behind in apples (0 vs 2), so if both die, we lose since opponent has more apples. DEADLY MOVE\u2014ELIMINATED!  \n   - **DOWN to (5,6):** On board (y=6 \u2265 0). Own body empty (no body, we're growing later). Enemy bodies: (6,8)/(7,8) not there. SAFE. Backward? We came from (5,6) last turn? Wait, our head was (5,7) this turn? No: start of turn 4, we're at (5,7). Last move we went UP from (5,6) to (5,7). So DOWN to (5,6) is back to previous spot\u2014NOT into our own body (still empty). SAFE.  \n   - **LEFT to (4,7):** On board (x=4 \u2265 0). Own body empty. Enemy bodies far. SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT to (6,7):** On board (x=6 \u2264 9). Own body empty. Enemy bodies: (6,8) is directly above, but (6,7) is clear. SAFE.  \n\n2. **Aggression & Strategy Among SAFE Moves:**  \n   - DOWN is passive\u2014retreating to y=6 while enemy dominates top. We lose board control. Not ideal.  \n   - LEFT to (4,7): Builds left flank, positions to block if enemy retreats south via (4,8)/(5,8) paths. From there, future options wide (up/down/left/right). Good for boxing but doesn't press the enemy hard yet.  \n   - RIGHT to (6,7): Aggressive push toward enemy's left side! Threatens his space directly\u2014 from here, next turn UP to (6,8) could force a collision or trap him against his own body. Plus, (6,7) is near apple (7,4)? Not relevant, but it keeps us in striking distance of top apples if we wanna grow later. From (6,7), we have options: UP (6,8), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7), DOWN (6,6). Wide open, multiple escape routes. This puts pressure on enemy: if he moves UP to (5,9) or RIGHT to (6,8), we're close to intercept. If he tries to flee left/down, we chase.  \n   - UP was deadly\u2014avoid head-on until we're up in score or corner him safely.  \n\n**Why RIGHT?** We're at (5,7), and RIGHT to (6,7) is the power play! It closes the gap on enemy, forcing him to react. If he stays greedy for apples (like (7,9) or (8,8)), we can next turn UP to (6,8) and box him against his own body at (7,8). From (6,7), we control the approach to his den\u2014vertical and horizontal dominance. LEFT feels too safe, but RIGHT screams aggression: \"Chat, we're not waiting\u2014we're invading!\" Keep future paths open: once we flank, we can pivot left to (5,8) or up to trap. Long-term: Turn 5 UP to (6,8), force him into dead-end at (7,9)/(8,9). If he crashes into us? We win. If we grow first? Even better. Let's make him sweat!\n\n**Long-term Plan:** From (6,7), next UP to cut off his down path, then LEFT to (5,8) if he's cornered. Snatch apple (7,9) safe later to grow. Watch for simultaneous moves\u2014 if he moves DOWN to (6,7), we crash? But he's unlikely. Stay alive, then attack! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5",

We have 0 apples. We need to **CRUSH** them before they get more apples. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**  \n1. **All Moves Check:**  \n   - **UP to (6,10):** Off the board \u2014 **DEADLY** \u274c  \n   - **DOWN to (6,8):** Enemy head is at (6,8) RIGHT NOW. If we both move simultaneously, this is a **HEAD-ON COLLISION**. Since we have 0 apples and they have 2, **WE DIE**. \u274c  \n   - **LEFT to (5,9):** On board. Check board: row 9 shows \". . . . . . . 1 A . .\" at (6,9) and (8,9) is A (apple). So (5,9) is empty (dots). SAFE.  \n   - **RIGHT to (7,9):** On board. Row 9: (7,9) is empty (dot between our head at (6,9) and apple at (8,9)). SAFE.  \n\n2. **Aggression & Domination:**  \n   - We're trapped in a corner! From (6,9), only LEFT or RIGHT are safe. UP is death, DOWN is head-on collision.  \n   - Enemy at (6,8) can move UP to (6,9) \u2014 if they do, we're already moving LEFT or RIGHT, so no head-on collision. They might also move LEFT to (5,8) or RIGHT to (7,8) to chase apples.  \n   - We need to **escape the corner** to maintain mobility. Staying in (6,9) limits us to only two future moves (LEFT/RIGHT) \u2014 too restrictive.  \n\n3. **Board Control & Long-Term Plan:**  \n   - **LEFT to (5,9)** puts us near the apple at (8,9) but also closer to the left side.  \n   - **RIGHT to (7,9)** moves us toward the apple at (8,9) \u2014 immediate content! If we grab it, we grow and tie their score.  \n   - From (7,9), next turn we can go DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9) for the apple.  \n   - From (5,9), next turn we can go DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9) \u2014 fewer apples nearby.  \n   - **LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We need apples to catch up. The apple at (8,9) is our best shot. If we move RIGHT, we can snipe it next turn. Meanwhile, enemy is stuck in the lower sector \u2014 we can keep them boxed in from the north. If they move UP to (6,9), we'll be at (7,9) and can chase them down.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT to (7,9) \u2014 aggressive positioning, secures a path to the apple at (8,9), and keeps us mobile. CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE CONTENT! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udf4e  \n\nRIGHT",

Quick, loud, and deadly \u2014 here\u2019s the read.\n\nImmediate legality check (fast):\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) = our neck = instant suicide. NOPE.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) = safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) = safe.\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) = currently opponent head; safe because moves are simultaneous (we can move into their current head cell as long as they vacate). Most aggressive.\n\nEnemy options from (6,9):\n- UP \u2192 (6,10) = off-board \u2192 instant death (they wouldn\u2019t).\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,9) = escape left.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) = apple at (7,9), tempting.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,8) = our current head (would be a head-swap if we move UP or another direction that vacates our head).\n\nTactical reasoning (think-out-loud, loud for chat):\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples (2 vs 0). Aggression is the play. We want to limit their escape routes and pressure them against the wall or onto apples where we can contest them.\n- LEFT or RIGHT are safe and keep options, but they don\u2019t immediately put pressure on their head. They let the opponent pick where to run next.\n- UP is the most aggressive: it immediately contests their head cell, pins their movement choices (they can\u2019t go up, and if they go for the apple right or try to go left we can follow and cut off their escape). If they go DOWN we do a head-swap \u2014 that\u2019s fine for us (no death) and keeps them boxed between us and the top wall. If they go RIGHT for the apple, we can pivot and chase into the same corridor to trap them near the wall. Forcing a true same-cell head-on this turn isn\u2019t possible from here, but UP maximizes pressure to force them into a risky play next turn.\n- Crucial: avoid moving into our neck (we won\u2019t). Maintain multiple exits when possible, but prioritize corralling this lone short opponent.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns) \u2014 paste this as our future rationale:\n- STEP 1: Play UP now to contest the head and push them against the top wall.\n- STEP 2: If they flee RIGHT to the apple, chase RIGHT then UP to cut them off toward the right wall; use our length to box them in.\n- STEP 3: If they flee LEFT, pivot left and collapse the corridor between the wall and our body; keep at least one escape route for ourselves.\n- STEP 4: If they attempt a desperate head-swap or weird move, exploit it \u2014 we survive, they get boxed. If a head-on same-cell ever becomes available when we still lead on apples, force it.\n\nShort, brutal verdict: aggressive pressure is the play. UP puts maximum stress on them and sets up a trap for the next turns. LET\u2019S FINISH HIM. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",
