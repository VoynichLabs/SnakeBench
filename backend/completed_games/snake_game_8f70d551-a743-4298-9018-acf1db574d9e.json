UP: (8, 5) - directly onto an apple!\n2. DOWN: (8, 3)\n3. LEFT: (7, 4)\n4.

UP (8,5):\n   - Collects the apple at (8,5) immediately.\n   - Grows my snake by 1 segment.\n   - Gains 1 point.\n   - Perfect move with no downsides.\n\n2. Other moves:\n   - All other moves don't collect an apple and are less optimal.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is clearly the best move as it:\n- Collects an apple immediately.\n- Grows my snake.\n- Maintains safe distance from enemy.\n- Sets up for future apple collection.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nAfter collecting this apple, reassess the board. The next closest apples are at (4,9) and (3,8). Consider moving toward these while maintaining awareness of enemy movements. Avoid getting trapped and prioritize apple collection while staying safe.\n\nUP",
