Let me analyze my possible moves:\n\n- UP: Would move to (1, 9), which is part of my body. Not possible.\n- DOWN: Would move to (1, 7), which is empty. Possible.\n- LEFT: Would move to (0, 8), which is empty. Possible.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2, 8), which is empty. Possible.\n\nLooking at the nearest apples:\n- (2, 1): Down and slightly to the right\n- (0, 0): Bottom left corner\n- (8, 0) and (8, 8): Far to the right\n- (9, 3): Far to the right\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (7, 7) with body at [(7, 8)], so they're on the right side of the board and not an immediate threat.\n\n# Decision Making\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 1), which requires me to move down and eventually right. I currently have three valid options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 7), I continue my vertical path toward the apple at (2, 1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 8), I'm closer to the apple at (0, 0), but I'd be putting myself in a more confined position near the edge.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 8), I'd be positioning myself better for the apple at (2, 1), making it a straight path down when I get to position (2, 7).\n\nThe RIGHT move seems optimal as it aligns me better with the apple at (2, 1) while keeping me away from the board edge. This gives me more flexibility in future moves.\n\n# Next Turn Strategy\nAfter moving RIGHT, I should continue moving DOWN to approach the apple at (2, 1). I'll need to be careful not to trap myself against the wall or my own body.\n\nRIGHT"

However, it enables further downward movement in future turns.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 7)** also keeps my options open and takes me to the edge of the board, allowing access to area with fewer obstructions and potentially also leading toward future apples.\n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n- My main priority should continue to be avoiding collisions and maximizing flexibility in movement.\n- Moving **DOWN** keeps me in the center row while moving **RIGHT** pushes me towards the outer edge, which might restrict my movement in subsequent turns.\n- Additionally, going down doesn\u2019t lead me closer to any apples, while going right keeps the options for future turns potentially more open.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **DOWN** seems less advantageous since I will be primarily focused on avoiding walls or my body in restricted subsequent moves. Thus, I will choose to move **RIGHT to (9, 7)** for continued flexibility and control over the board.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT.**"

Possible.\n- LEFT: Would move to (1, 5), which is empty. Possible.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (3, 5), which is empty. Possible.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (2, 1): This is still directly below me at the same x-coordinate\n- (0, 0): Bottom left corner\n- (7, 1): On the right side of the bottom row\n- (8, 0): Bottom right corner\n- (9, 3): Right side of the board\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (8, 8) with body at [(8, 7), (8, 6)], so they're still on the right side of the board and not an immediate threat.\n\n# Decision Making\n\nI'll continue with my strategy to go for the apple at (2, 1), which is aligned with my current x-coordinate. This apple is the closest to me and requires the fewest turns.\n\nMoving DOWN would continue my path toward this apple. I'm at (2, 5) and the apple is at (2, 1), so I need to keep moving down to reach it.\n\nThe enemy snake is still far to the right and not in my path, so I don't need to worry about collision with them right now.\n\n# Next Turn Strategy\n\nAfter moving DOWN, I'll continue moving DOWN until I reach y=1, where I'll be at the apple at (2, 1). After collecting that apple, I'll need to decide whether to head toward (0, 0) or (7, 1) based on my position after eating the apple at (2, 1).\n\nDOWN"
