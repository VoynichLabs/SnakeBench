Eat that apple, grow to length 3, and set you up with a tight right-edge corridor to pressure the rival later. After this, you\u2019ll want to extend along the right column, force small detours from him, and keep options open to avoid being boxed in.\n\nShort-term plan: after DOWN, keep a vertical leash along x=9 to pressure the center and threaten a potential head-on when we\u2019re ahead in apples. Use the extra length to create defensive space and avoid risky moves that could trap us.\n\nLong-term plan: build a controlled queue along the edge to box him in, aim to force a head-on if we have a score lead, and prize safety while stacking apples to widen the lead.\n\nSafety and edge awareness: maintain at least two escape routes and monitor enemy heading; don\u2019t let him wedge you into a corner.\n\nDOWN",

UP and RIGHT are DEAD (into yourself or off-board).\n\n- HIGH-LEVEL PLAN: Stay aggressive but keep multiple escape routes. Press from the right edge, use the edge to limit his mobility, and keep a potential head-on option since we\u2019re ahead in apples.\n- WHY DOWN NOW: Keeps us hugging the right edge (9,4 after move), preserves two solid futures (down or left), and avoids tightening into a trap that could happen if we chase left too early.\n- WHY NOT LEFT: Slants us inside the board, could create angles that give him room to dodge and complicates edge-based pressure. It also breaks the immediate edge leash we want to maintain for later boxing.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Move DOWN to (9,4), maintain the vertical edge, and stay ready to either loop left or advance further down in subsequent turns while watching the opponent\u2019s moves.\n\nFINAL DECISION: DOWN",
