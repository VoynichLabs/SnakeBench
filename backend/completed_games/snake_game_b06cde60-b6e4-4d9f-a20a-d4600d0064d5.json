          "rationale": "Alright chat, listen up! We're on Turn 0 and it's LIVE! We're Snake #1, our head is at (7, 2), and we have no body yet. The enemy snake (#0) is at (5, 0). No apples collected yet. Let's get this bread.\n\nFirst, let's look at the board. We're at (7, 2). Apples are scattered everywhere, but like the streamer said, we're not focusing on apples right now. We're focusing on the enemy snake. We gotta box him in and make him crash.\n\nLet me think about my moves. I can't go outside the board, and I can't run into my own body (I have none), and I can't run into the enemy body (he has none either).\n\nWait, but the enemy is also moving at the same time. If I move towards him, he might move towards me. That would be a head-on collision. Since we both have 0 apples, it would be a draw if we collide. I don't want a draw. I want to win. So maybe I should avoid a head-on collision for now? Or maybe... wait, the prompt says \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I don't have a higher score yet. So I should avoid it?\n\nBut also, if I crash into him, I lose. If he crashes into me, he loses. So it's dangerous.\n\nLet's look at the coordinates. My head is (7, 2). Enemy head is (5, 0).\n\nPossible moves for me:\n1.  UP: (7, 3)\n2.  DOWN: (7, 1) -> Wait, y=0 is the bottom. So y=1 is valid. y=0 is valid. Wait, coordinates go from 0 to 9.\n    Wait, the prompt says: \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n    So y=0 is the bottom row. y=9 is the top row.\n    My current pos is (7, 2).\n    - DOWN would be (7, 1).\n    - UP would be (7, 3).\n\n    Is (7, 1) safe? Looking at the board state:\n    Row 1: ` . . . . . . . . . . ` (Wait, let me check the visual board)\n    ```\n     9 . . . . . . A . . .\n     8 . . . . . . A A . .\n     7 A . . A . . . . . A\n     6 . . . . A A . . . A\n     5 A . . . . . . . . .\n     4 . . . . A . . . . A\n     3 A . . . . . . . A .\n     2 . . . . . . . 1 . .  <-- My head is here\n     1 . . . . . . . . . .\n     0 . . . . . 0 . A . .\n    ```\n    So row 1 (y=1) is all empty dots. (7, 1) is safe from walls and obstacles.\n    Is (7, 3) safe?\n    Row 3: ` A . . . . . . . A . `\n    x=7 on row 3 is empty (index 7 is the 8th character, there is a dot there). Wait, let's count.\n    Row 3: `A . . . . . . . A .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So x=7 is a dot. Safe.\n\n    Is (6, 2) (LEFT) safe?\n    Row 2: ` . . . . . . . 1 . . `\n    x=6 on row 2 is a dot. Safe.\n\n    Is (8, 2) (RIGHT) safe?\n    x=8 on row 2 is a dot. Safe.\n\n    Okay, all 4 directions seem initially safe regarding walls and my own body (I'm length 1, no tail yet).\n\n    Now, where is the enemy? (5, 0). He is far away. He is at the bottom row (y=0). He has body none.\n    If I move UP to (7, 3), I go away from him.\n    If I move DOWN to (7, 1), I get closer to him in Y (he's at 0, I'm at 2). X distance is |7-5| = 2.\n    If I move LEFT to (6, 2), X distance becomes 1.\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 2), X distance becomes 3.\n\n    The prompt says \"box him in\". He is at (5, 0). He is on the bottom row.\n    If I go DOWN to (7, 1), I'm closer.\n    But wait, he is at (5, 0). He can go UP (5,1), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0).\n    He can't go DOWN (off board).\n\n    If I go DOWN to (7, 1):\n    If he goes RIGHT to (6, 0), we are far.\n    If he goes UP to (5, 1), we are at (7,1) vs (5,1). Manhattan distance = 2.\n    If he goes LEFT to (4, 0), distance = |7-4| + |1-0| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n    If I go LEFT to (6, 2):\n    If he goes UP to (5, 1), distance = |6-5| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. Close.\n    If he goes RIGHT (6,0), distance = |6-6| + |2-0| = 2. Close.\n\n    If I go UP to (7, 3):\n    If he goes UP (5,1), distance = |7-5| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n    I want to dominate. I want to box him in. He is at the bottom edge. If I move DOWN, I push him against the wall?\n    He is at (5,0). The wall is at y=0. I am at y=2.\n    If I move DOWN to (7,1), I am at y=1.\n    Next turn, if I move DOWN to (7,0), I would be on the same row as him.\n    However, if I go DOWN now, I am leaving the center of the board.\n    The apples are everywhere. (9,7) is far. (4,4) is closer. (9,6) etc.\n\n    Let's look at the apples.\n    Nearest apples to me (7,2):\n    (9,4) -> distance |9-7| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n    (7,8) -> distance 6\n    (6,8) -> 1+6=7\n    (4,6) -> 3+4=7\n    (8,3) -> 1+1=2 (Wait, is there an apple at 8,3? Yes, ` . A ` at index 8 on row 3).\n    (7,0) -> 0+2=2 (Apple at 7,0? Yes, row 0 has ` . A ` at index 7).\n    (0,3) -> far.\n\n    So the closest apples are (8,3) and (7,0).\n    (8,3) is UP-RIGHT. (7,0) is DOWN.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2), I am 1 step away from (8,3) (up).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am 1 step away from (7,0) (down).\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), I am getting away from (8,3).\n    If I go UP to (7,3), I am 1 step away from (8,3) (right) or (7,0) is further.\n\n    Strategy: \"Don't focus on apples... Focus on enemy... Grow as a means of dominating.\"\n    \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    Currently score 0-0. Avoid head-on collision if possible, unless I can trap him.\n\n    Enemy at (5,0). He is stuck against the bottom wall.\n    If I move DOWN to (7,1), I am approaching him.\n    But wait, if I go DOWN, I am moving to y=1.\n    He might go UP to (5,1).\n    Then next turn, I can try to cut him off.\n    However, if I go DOWN, I am also moving away from the center (where other apples are).\n\n    Let's think about trapping.\n    He is at (5,0). He has 3 moves: (5,1), (4,0), (6,0).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am not blocking any of his moves directly.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), I am closer to his X.\n    If I go DOWN-LEFT... I can't.\n\n    What if I go DOWN to (7,1)?\n    If he goes UP to (5,1), I can maybe chase him.\n    But (5,1) is empty. (7,1) is empty.\n    If he goes UP, he enters row 1.\n    Row 1 is mostly empty.\n    Row 2 has me (if I am at 7,2).\n    Row 3 has apples at (8,3).\n\n    Let's consider the \"Boxing in\" plan.\n    He is at the bottom left area (5,0).\n    I am at (7,2).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am closer.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), I am closer in X.\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    ```\n     9 . . . . . . A . . .\n     8 . . . . . . A A . .\n     7 A . . A . . . . . A\n     6 . . . . A A . . . A\n     5 A . . . . . . . . .\n     4 . . . . A . . . . A\n     3 A . . . . . . . A .\n     2 . . . . . . . 1 . .\n     1 . . . . . . . . . .\n     0 . . . . . 0 . A . .\n    ```\n    Wait, looking at row 0: ` . . . . . 0 . A . . `\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    Enemy is at 5,0.\n    Apple is at 7,0.\n    Apple is at 0,3.\n\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1):\n    Next turn I could go DOWN to (7,0) to eat the apple.\n    But wait, if I go to (7,0), and the enemy is at (5,0), distance is 2.\n    If the enemy goes RIGHT to (6,0), distance is 1.\n    If he goes RIGHT to (7,0) and I go to (7,0), we crash (draw).\n    Since I have no apples, and he has no apples, draw is bad.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2):\n    I am moving towards the apple at (8,3) and (9,4).\n    I am moving AWAY from the enemy.\n    Is that good? \"Be aggressive\".\n    If I ignore him, he might eat apples and grow.\n    But he is at (5,0). Nearest apples to him:\n    (7,0) - distance 2 (RIGHT, RIGHT)\n    (4,4) - distance 4 + 4 = 8\n    (0,3) - 5 + 3 = 8\n    (0,5) - 5 + 5 = 10\n    So his nearest apple is (7,0).\n    To get (7,0), he needs to go RIGHT, RIGHT.\n    If I am at (7,1) or (8,2), I am closer to (7,0) and (8,3).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I can potentially block his path to (7,0) or intercept him.\n\n    Let's simulate a bit.\n    My move: DOWN to (7,1).\n    Enemy move possibilities:\n    1. RIGHT to (6,0).\n       Next turn: I am at (7,1). He is at (6,0).\n       I can go DOWN to (7,0) (Apple). He can go RIGHT to (7,0). Collision? If he goes RIGHT, we crash. He dies (crashes into my body? Wait, no, we crash heads). Head-on collision. Both die. Draw.\n       If I go DOWN and he goes UP to (6,1)? Then I am at (7,0), he is at (6,1). Safe.\n    2. UP to (5,1).\n       Next turn: I am at (7,1). He is at (5,1).\n       I can go LEFT to (6,1). He can go RIGHT to (6,1). Collision. Draw.\n    3. LEFT to (4,0). He moves away.\n\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2):\n    Enemy at (5,0).\n    If he goes RIGHT (6,0), I am at (6,2), he is at (6,0). Distance 2.\n    If he goes UP (5,1), I am at (6,2), he is at (5,1). Distance 2.\n\n    If I go UP to (7,3):\n    I move away from him. He might eat the apple at (7,0) or (0,3).\n    If he eats (7,0), he grows. I don't want that.\n\n    Okay, the prompt says \"Box him in\". He is at (5,0).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am putting pressure on the bottom right.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), I am putting pressure on the middle left.\n    (6,2) is closer to him. |6-5| + |2-0| = 1+2=3.\n    (7,1) is |7-5| + |1-0| = 2+1=3. Same distance.\n    However, (6,2) is higher up (y=2). (7,1) is lower (y=1).\n\n    Let's look at the board structure near him.\n    He is at (5,0).\n    To his left is (4,0). To his right is (6,0).\n    Below him is nothing (wall).\n    Above him is (5,1).\n    Row 1 is empty.\n    Row 2 has me (currently at 7,2).\n    Row 3 has an apple at (8,3).\n\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2):\n    I am at x=6. He is at x=5.\n    If he goes UP to (5,1), I can go DOWN to (6,1) to cut him off?\n    (6,1) is currently empty.\n    If I go to (6,1) and he goes to (5,1), we are adjacent.\n    Next move, if he goes RIGHT to (6,1) and I am still there (or move into it), he dies.\n    If I move to (6,1), my tail will be at (7,2) (if I don't eat).\n    Wait, I start at length 1. If I move, my tail stays at (7,2) initially, then moves to my old head? No, snake logic: head moves, tail follows (if not growing).\n    Current head (7,2).\n    If I move LEFT to (6,2), new head is (6,2). Old head (7,2) becomes body. Tail is (7,2).\n    So the board will have my body at (7,2) and head at (6,2).\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1) next turn, my body will be (6,2) and head (6,1). Tail (7,2) moves to (6,2)?\n    Actually, standard snake rules: Head moves. If no apple, tail moves forward.\n    So after first move LEFT: Head (6,2), Body (7,2). (Length 2).\n    After second move DOWN: Head (6,1), Body (6,2). (Length 2).\n    So (7,2) becomes empty.\n\n    Back to the decision.\n    I want to dominate.\n    He is at (5,0).\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2):\n    I am putting myself in a position to cut off his path to the right side (where apples are).\n    Apples at (7,0), (8,3), (9,4), (9,6) etc are to the right/top-right.\n    If I stand at (6,2), I am between him and the right-side apples.\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am on the right side. He could potentially go around me to the left or up?\n\n    Let's check the apples again.\n    (8,3) is very close to (7,2). Manhattan distance 2.\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2), distance to apple is 1.\n    If I go UP to (7,3), distance is 1.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), distance to (8,3) is 3.\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), distance to (8,3) is 3.\n\n    If I ignore the apple at (8,3), I can focus on the enemy.\n    The prompt says \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n    So I should prioritize positioning relative to the enemy.\n\n    Enemy at (5,0). He wants to go to (7,0) or (4,4) or (0,5).\n    To get to (7,0), he must pass through (6,0).\n    To get to (4,4), he goes (4,1)->(4,2)->...\n    To get to (0,5), he goes left.\n\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2):\n    I am directly above (6,0) and (6,1).\n    If he tries to go to (7,0), he must go through (6,0).\n    If I go to (6,2), and he goes to (6,0), I am 2 squares above him.\n    If I then go DOWN to (6,1), I am blocking the column above him.\n    If he is at (6,0) and I am at (6,1), if he tries to go UP to (6,1), he crashes into me (I am stationary body? Or I move?). We move simultaneously.\n    If he moves UP to (6,1) and I move DOWN to (6,0), we cross paths? No, simultaneous. He enters (6,1), I leave (6,1) for (6,0). We don't collide.\n    If I move DOWN to (6,1) and he moves UP to (6,1), we collide (head-on/same cell). Both die. Draw.\n    If I move DOWN to (6,1) and he moves RIGHT to (7,0), no collision.\n\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1):\n    I am at (7,1). He is at (5,0).\n    He wants (7,0). He is 2 steps away (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n    I am 1 step away from (7,0) (DOWN).\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1) -> Next turn I can go DOWN to (7,0) and eat the apple.\n    If I eat the apple at (7,0), I grow.\n    He is at (5,0). If he goes RIGHT to (6,0), he is at (6,0).\n    If I am at (7,0) (head) and body at (7,1), (7,2).\n    He is at (6,0).\n    If he tries to go to (7,0) next, he crashes into my head. He dies. I win.\n    BUT, if he goes RIGHT to (6,0) NOW (Turn 1), and I go DOWN to (7,1) NOW.\n    On Turn 2, I go DOWN to (7,0) (eat apple). He is at (6,0).\n    On Turn 3, if he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he crashes into me (I am at 7,0). He dies.\n    This seems like a solid plan to kill him or block him.\n\n    Let's refine the plan: \"Box him in\".\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), I am claiming the bottom right area.\n    He is at (5,0).\n    If he goes RIGHT to (6,0), he is essentially stepping into a trap? Or stepping next to me.\n    If I am at (7,1) and he is at (6,0), I can potentially move LEFT to (6,1) to block his path up?\n    Or move to (7,0) to eat the apple and block his path right.\n\n    Let's compare \"LEFT to (6,2)\" vs \"DOWN to (7,1)\".\n    LEFT to (6,2):\n    - Pro: Cuts off the center. Higher ground.\n    - Pro: Closer to enemy (X difference 1).\n    - Con: Further from the apple at (7,0).\n    - Con: Further from the apple at (8,3).\n\n    DOWN to (7,1):\n    - Pro: Closer to apple at (7,0).\n    - Pro: Closer to apple at (8,3) (compared to LEFT).\n    - Pro: Directly challenges the enemy's path to (7,0).\n    - Con: I'm moving down towards the wall (y=0). If I go to (7,0), I am on the wall. If the enemy is at (5,0) or (6,0), I might get trapped against the wall.\n      Wait, I am length 1. If I go to (7,0) and eat, I am length 2.\n      Head (7,0). Body (7,1).\n      If enemy is at (6,0), he is adjacent.\n      If he moves to (7,0), he dies (crashes into my head).\n      If I move to (7,0) and he moves to (7,0), draw.\n      If I stay at (7,0) and he moves to (7,0) next turn, he dies (I have body behind me).\n      So being at (7,0) is a strong defensive position against him coming from the left.\n\n    Is there a risk in going DOWN?\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), and the enemy goes UP to (5,1).\n    Then I am at (7,1), he is at (5,1).\n    I can go DOWN to (7,0) (eat apple).\n    He can go RIGHT to (6,1).\n    Next turn: Me at (7,0) (len 2). Him at (6,1).\n    He can go DOWN to (6,0). Or RIGHT to (7,1).\n    If he goes RIGHT to (7,1), he crashes into my body (7,1). He dies. I win.\n    If he goes DOWN to (6,0), he is safe.\n    So if he goes UP, he actually gives me the apple at (7,0) for free, and if he tries to flank me, he hits my body.\n\n    Let's check the \"LEFT\" option again.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2).\n    Enemy at (5,0).\n    If he goes RIGHT to (6,0).\n    I am at (6,2). He is at (6,0).\n    I can go DOWN to (6,1). He can go UP to (6,1).\n    Collision? Yes, if we both move to (6,1). Draw.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1) and he goes UP to (6,1), draw.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1) and he goes RIGHT to (7,0), no collision.\n    So going LEFT gives me a chance to force a draw if he comes up the same column. But I don't want a draw.\n    I want to win.\n\n    Going DOWN gives me a chance to eat an apple (grow) and potentially kill him if he flanks me.\n    Eating an apple is +1 score. If I have a higher score, I can force head-on collisions later.\n    So growing is good.\n\n    Also, the prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    Getting an apple now gives me 1-0. Then I can go for collisions.\n\n    So, the move DOWN seems better to secure the apple at (7,0).\n    Let's check the coordinates for DOWN: (7, 1).\n    Is it safe?\n    Board state row 1: ` . . . . . . . . . . `\n    Index 7 is empty.\n    No snake bodies there.\n    Enemy is at (5,0), not (7,1).\n    So it's safe.\n\n    What if the enemy moves to (7,1)?\n    Can he?\n    He is at (5,0). He moves 1 step.\n    To get to (7,1), he would need to move RIGHT (to 6,0) and then diagonally? No, only orthogonal.\n    So he cannot reach (7,1) in one turn.\n    So I am safe from collision with his head this turn.\n\n    So plan:\n    1. Move DOWN to (7,1).\n    2. Prepare to move DOWN to (7,0) next turn to eat the apple.\n    3. Watch his position. If he moves to (6,0), I eat the apple and block him.\n    4. If he moves to (5,1), I eat the apple and watch out for him trying to hit my body at (7,1).\n\n    Wait, if I am at (7,1) and he is at (5,1).\n    Next turn I move to (7,0). My body is at (7,1).\n    He is at (5,1). He can move to (6,1).\n    (6,1) is empty.\n    (7,1) is my body.\n    If he moves to (6,1), he is safe.\n    If he moves to (7,1), he dies.\n    If he moves to (5,0), he retreats.\n    If he moves to (5,2), he goes up.\n\n    This seems like a solid opening. Controlling the bottom right corner.\n\n    Let's write the plan for the next turn.\n    \"Plan: Move DOWN to (7,1) to approach the apple at (7,0). Watch enemy at (5,0). If he moves RIGHT, I'll eat the apple next turn and block his path. If he moves UP, I'll secure the apple and prepare to flank him.\"\n\n    The prompt says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\n    I will include that.\n\n    Final check on other moves:\n    UP to (7,3): Safe. But gives up the bottom right control. Enemy might take (7,0). Bad.\n    LEFT to (6,2): Safe. More central. But misses the easy apple at (7,0). Enemy might take it.\n    RIGHT to (8,2): Safe. Moves towards (8,3) apple. But leaves (7,0) open. Enemy might take it.\n\n    Given the instruction to be aggressive and box him in, taking the space he needs (the apple at 7,0) is the most aggressive move.\n\n    One detail: The apple is at (7,0). To get there, I need to pass through (7,1).\n    By moving to (7,1) now, I am securing the path to the apple.\n\n    Let's go with DOWN.\n\n    Rationale:\n    - Moving DOWN to (7,1) puts me in position to eat the apple at (7,0) next turn.\n    - This apple is closer to me than to the enemy (I'm at x=7, y=2; he's at x=5, y=0).\n    - Eating the apple gives me the lead (1-0), allowing me to force head-on collisions later.\n    - This move also asserts dominance over the bottom-right quadrant, boxing the enemy in against the left wall and bottom wall.\n    - All other moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) delay securing this apple or allow the enemy to potentially claim it or other assets.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board again:\n    Row 0: ` . . . . . 0 . A . . `\n    The apple is at (7,0).\n    The enemy is at (5,0).\n    There is a gap (6,0) between them.\n    If I move DOWN to (7,1), I am vertically aligned with the apple.\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,0), he is horizontally adjacent to the apple.\n    Next turn:\n    Me -> (7,0) (Eat).\n    Him -> (7,0) ? If he tries, he dies (I am there first? Simultaneous move).\n    Simultaneous move: We both move to (7,0). We both die. Draw.\n    But if I move to (7,0) and he moves to (7,0), draw.\n    If he moves to (6,0) and I move to (7,0), no collision.\n    Is there a risk of him moving to (7,0) next turn?\n    He is at (5,0) now. He moves to (6,0) now.\n    Next turn he is at (6,0). He moves to (7,0).\n    I am at (7,1) now. I move to (7,0) next.\n    If we both move to (7,0), draw.\n    But wait, if I am at (7,1) and he is at (6,0).\n    I move to (7,0). He moves to (7,0).\n    Draw.\n    Is there a way to avoid the draw?\n    If I eat the apple, I grow. My tail stays at (7,1). My head at (7,0).\n    If he moves to (7,0), he crashes into my head. He dies. I win.\n    Wait, simultaneous move.\n    I move from (7,1) to (7,0).\n    He moves from (6,0) to (7,0).\n    Result: Both heads at (7,0).\n    Rule: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\n    So it IS a draw.\n    So if he goes to (6,0) now, and I go to (7,1) now.\n    Next turn, if I go to (7,0) and he goes to (7,0), we both die.\n    That's not good.\n    I want to win.\n\n    So I should avoid the draw.\n    How can I avoid the draw?\n    If I go to (7,1), and he goes to (6,0).\n    Next turn, I go to (7,0). He goes somewhere else?\n    He might not go to (7,0) if he sees I am going for it. But the bot might play optimally.\n    If he goes to (7,0), it's a draw.\n    If I don't go to (7,0), I miss the apple.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2) now:\n    He goes to (6,0).\n    I am at (6,2). He is at (6,0).\n    Distance 2.\n    I can go DOWN to (6,1).\n    He can go UP to (6,1).\n    Collision -> Draw.\n    Or he goes RIGHT to (7,0).\n    I go DOWN to (6,1).\n    No collision.\n\n    If I go UP to (7,3) now:\n    He goes to (6,0).\n    Distance increases.\n    I miss (7,0) apple. He might eat it later.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2) now:\n    He goes to (6,0).\n    I miss (7,0).\n\n    Let's reconsider the \"Draw\" risk.\n    If I go DOWN to (7,1), and he goes RIGHT to (6,0).\n    Next turn, if I go DOWN to (7,0), and he goes RIGHT to (7,0), we draw.\n    BUT, what if I don't go DOWN to (7,0)?\n    What if I stay at (7,1)?\n    I can't stay, I have to move.\n    If I go LEFT to (6,1)?\n    (6,1) is safe.\n    If I am at (7,1) and he is at (6,0).\n    I move LEFT to (6,1). He moves RIGHT to (7,0).\n    I am at (6,1). He is at (7,0).\n    No collision.\n    I missed the apple. He got the apple.\n    He grows to length 2. Score 1-0 (Enemy lead).\n    This is bad.\n\n    If I am at (7,1) and he is at (6,0).\n    I move DOWN to (7,0). He moves UP to (6,1).\n    I eat apple (Score 1-0 Me). He is at (6,1).\n    This is the best outcome.\n\n    The only bad outcome is if he moves to (7,0) next turn.\n    Would he do that?\n    If he moves to (7,0) while I move to (7,0), he dies (draw).\n    Is he programmed to kamikaze?\n    The prompt says: \"We gotta make a plan to box him in and make him crash out!!\"\n    It implies he might crash if we trap him.\n    But if he just moves into me, it's a draw.\n\n    Let's look at his options from (6,0) (assuming he goes there).\n    He can go:\n    1. RIGHT to (7,0).\n    2. UP to (6,1).\n    3. LEFT to (5,0).\n    If he goes UP to (6,1), he is safe.\n    If he goes LEFT, he retreats.\n    If he goes RIGHT, he risks a draw.\n\n    Is there a move that guarantees I don't draw?\n    If I don't go for (7,0), I avoid the draw.\n    But I lose the apple.\n\n    Let's look at the other apples.\n    (8,3) is also close.\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2) now.\n    Next turn I can go UP to (8,3) (eat apple).\n    He is at (5,0).\n    He can go RIGHT to (6,0).\n    He is far from me.\n    No collision risk.\n    I get +1 score. He gets 0.\n    Then I have 1-0.\n    Then I can hunt him.\n\n    Is (8,3) reachable without risk?\n    Current: (7,2).\n    Move RIGHT to (8,2). (Safe).\n    Next: UP to (8,3). (Safe? Board shows A at 8,3).\n    Yes.\n    Score: 1-0.\n\n    Compared to:\n    Move DOWN to (7,1). (Safe).\n    Next: DOWN to (7,0). (Risky - potential draw).\n    Or LEFT to (6,1). (Safe, but no apple).\n\n    If I go for (7,0) and it's a draw, I get 0 apples. He gets 0 apples (if he dies too).\n    Wait, if we draw, we both die.\n    \"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins. If tied? It's a draw.\"\n    If we draw on turn 1, score 0-0. It's a draw.\n    A draw is not a win.\n\n    So I should avoid the draw.\n    Therefore, going for (7,0) is risky because of the potential head-on collision (draw).\n    Going for (8,3) seems safer.\n\n    But wait, the prompt says \"Box him in\".\n    If I go RIGHT to (8,2), I am moving away from him. I am not boxing him in. I am letting him have the bottom left.\n    He could eat the apple at (7,0) on his second turn (if he survives).\n    If I go RIGHT, I let him eat (7,0). He becomes 1-0.\n    Then he has the lead. He can try to kill me.\n\n    Let's analyze the \"Boxing\" strategy again.\n    If I move to restrict his space, I should move towards him.\n    Moving LEFT to (6,2) or DOWN to (7,1).\n    LEFT to (6,2):\n    From (6,2), I can move to (6,1) or (5,2) or (7,2).\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), and he goes RIGHT to (6,0).\n    I am at (6,2). He is at (6,0).\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1), and he goes UP to (6,1) -> Draw.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1), and he goes RIGHT to (7,0) -> No collision.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1), and he goes LEFT to (5,0) -> No collision.\n\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), and he goes UP to (5,1).\n    I am at (6,2). He is at (5,1).\n    Distance 2.\n    I can go DOWN to (6,1). He can go RIGHT to (6,1). -> Draw.\n    Or he goes UP to (5,2). Distance 1. Collision? (6,2) vs (5,2). Safe.\n    Next turn I can go LEFT to (5,2) to chase him.\n\n    The \"Draw\" risk exists if I move directly towards him and he moves towards me.\n    But if I move UP or RIGHT, I avoid the draw but give up territory.\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    There is an apple at (8,3).\n    There is an apple at (7,0).\n    There is an apple at (9,4).\n    There is an apple at (4,4).\n\n    If I go UP to (7,3):\n    I am at (7,3).\n    Next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,3) (eat apple).\n    He is at (5,0).\n    He can go RIGHT to (6,0).\n    He can go UP to (5,1).\n    He is far.\n    I get the apple. Score 1-0.\n    This seems like the safest way to get the lead.\n    Being at (7,3) is also central. I can move to (7,4), (6,3), (8,3), (7,2).\n    From (7,3), I control the center right.\n\n    Let's compare:\n    1. DOWN (7,1): Risky (draw at 7,0). Reward: Block enemy bottom.\n    2. LEFT (6,2): Risky (draw at 6,1). Reward: Block enemy center.\n    3. RIGHT (8,2): Safe. Reward: Apple at 8,3 next turn.\n    4. UP (7,3): Safe. Reward: Apple at 8,3 next turn (via RIGHT).\n\n    Option 3 (RIGHT) puts me at (8,2). From there, UP goes to (8,3).\n    Option 4 (UP) puts me at (7,3). From there, RIGHT goes to (8,3).\n    Option 4 seems slightly better because (7,3) has more neighbors (4) than (8,2) (3 neighbors, if 8,2 is on the edge? No, 8,2 is x=8, max is 9. So (8,2) has neighbors: (7,2), (9,2), (8,1), (8,3). 4 neighbors. Both are fine.\n\n    However, (7,3) is closer to the apple at (4,4) and (0,5) if I want to go left later.\n    (8,2) is closer to (9,4).\n\n    Let's reconsider the \"Box him in\" command.\n    The user wants me to box him in.\n    If I go UP or RIGHT, I am moving away from him.\n    If I move away, I am not boxing him in. I am giving him space.\n    He is at (5,0). If I give him space, he can grow.\n    If he grows, he becomes a threat.\n\n    The prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n    Dominating means controlling space.\n    If I control the space he wants, I dominate.\n    He wants (7,0).\n    If I take (7,0), I dominate that space.\n    But (7,0) is risky.\n\n    Is there a way to dominate without the draw risk?\n    If I move to (6,2) (LEFT).\n    I am closer to him.\n    If I am closer, I can potentially trap him.\n    But the draw risk is high if we run into each other.\n\n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    (7,0) is a \"trap\" apple because of the wall.\n    (8,3) is an \"open\" apple.\n\n    What if I ignore (7,0) and go for (8,3) to secure a lead?\n    If I have 1-0, I can be more aggressive.\n    The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    So getting a score lead is priority 1?\n\n    \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n    This suggests apples are secondary to positioning against the enemy.\n    However, \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n    So I need to grow to dominate.\n\n    If I ignore (7,0), the enemy might take it.\n    If he takes (7,0), he grows.\n    Then we are 0-0 or 0-1?\n    If I don't take any apple, and he takes (7,0), he is 1-0.\n    Then he can force head-on collisions against me.\n    That is bad.\n\n    So I MUST prevent him from getting that apple.\n    How can I prevent him from getting (7,0) without risking a draw myself?\n    I can't physically block him without being there.\n    But if I move to threaten him, he might not go for it.\n\n    Let's look at the board geometry again.\n    He is at (5,0).\n    (7,0) is at x=7.\n    To get there, he must pass x=6.\n    If I move to (6,2) (LEFT).\n    I am at x=6.\n    If I move to (6,2) now, I control x=6.\n    If he goes to (6,0), I am at (6,2).\n    We are in the same column.\n    Next turn, if I go DOWN to (6,1), I block the column.\n    If he tries to go UP to (6,1), he crashes into me (if I am there).\n    If I am at (6,1) and he is at (6,0).\n    If he goes UP to (6,1), he crashes. He dies. I win.\n    If he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he is safe.\n    But wait, if I am at (6,2) and he is at (6,0).\n    I move DOWN to (6,1).\n    He moves RIGHT to (7,0).\n    He gets the apple. He grows.\n    I am at (6,1). He is at (7,0).\n    I didn't block him. I just blocked the column above him. He went around.\n\n    To block him from (7,0), I need to be at (7,0) or (6,0) or (7,1).\n    If I am at (7,1), and he is at (6,0).\n    He can go to (7,0). I can go to (7,0).\n    Draw.\n\n    What if I go to (7,1) and he goes to (6,0).\n    Next turn, I go to (6,1) (LEFT).\n    He is at (6,0).\n    If he goes UP to (6,1), he crashes. He dies. I win.\n    If he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he is safe.\n    But if he goes to (7,0), I am at (6,1).\n    I haven't eaten an apple yet. Score 0-0.\n    He has eaten (7,0). Score 0-1.\n    Now he has the lead.\n\n    So, if I go to (7,1) -> (6,1), I threaten him with death if he goes UP, but I let him eat the apple if he goes RIGHT.\n    If he is smart, he will eat the apple.\n\n    Is there a move that blocks both?\n    From (7,1), if I go to (6,1), I block UP.\n    I don't block RIGHT.\n    From (6,2), if I go to (6,1), I block UP.\n    I don't block RIGHT.\n\n    To block RIGHT (to 7,0), I need to be at (7,0) or (7,1) or (7,2) (no, he can go to 7,0).\n    Actually, if I am at (7,1), and he is at (6,0).\n    If he goes to (7,0), I can't stop him unless I also go to (7,0) (draw).\n\n    So, if he decides to take (7,0), I cannot stop him without dying.\n    Unless... I am already at (7,0).\n    If I go to (7,1) now, I am not at (7,0).\n    If I go to (7,0) now, I can't. I am at (7,2). Distance 2.\n\n    So, I cannot guarantee preventing him from eating (7,0) next turn (Turn 1).\n    He is at (5,0). He is 2 steps away.\n    I am at (7,2). I am 2 steps away.\n    It's a race.\n    But if we race to (7,0), it's a draw (if we arrive same turn).\n    If he goes (5,0) -> (6,0) -> (7,0).\n    I go (7,2) -> (7,1) -> (7,0).\n    We arrive at (7,0) on Turn 2.\n    Simultaneous move. Draw.\n\n    So, racing for (7,0) is a draw.\n    I should NOT race for (7,0).\n    I should go somewhere else.\n\n    Where else?\n    (8,3) is available.\n    (4,4) is available.\n\n    If I go for (8,3):\n    I go (7,2) -> (8,2) -> (8,3).\n    He goes (5,0) -> (6,0) -> (7,0).\n    He gets 1 point. I get 1 point.\n    Score 1-1.\n    We are tied.\n    Now he has a body (tail at 6,0). I have a body (tail at 8,2).\n    We are at (8,3) and (7,0).\n    Distance is large.\n\n    If I go for (4,4):\n    (7,2) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4). (5 turns).\n    He goes to (7,0) in 2 turns.\n    He gets apple first.\n    He grows.\n    He has more mass.\n\n    So, (8,3) seems like the best \"other\" apple.\n    It's fast. It's safe.\n\n    Is there a downside to going for (8,3)?\n    I am moving away from the enemy.\n    The prompt says \"Focus on enemy\".\n    But if focusing on the enemy leads to a draw, and getting an apple leads to a tie (or win later), the apple seems better.\n\n    Wait, if we both get an apple (1-1), and he is at (7,0) and I am at (8,3).\n    He is in the corner.\n    I am in the open.\n    I can chase him.\n    If I have equal score, I should avoid head-on collisions.\n    But I can trap him.\n    He is at (7,0). He can only go UP (7,1) or LEFT (6,0).\n    If I go to (8,3), I can move towards him.\n    But he has a body now.\n    If I trap him, he crashes into me.\n\n    Let's compare:\n    Option A: Go for (7,0). -> Draw. (Bad).\n    Option B: Go for (8,3). -> 1-1 tie. (Okay).\n    Option C: Go for (4,4). -> He gets (7,0) first. He leads 1-0. (Bad).\n\n    So, Option B is best among these.\n    But can I do better?\n    What if I go to (6,2) (LEFT)?\n    I am not going for an apple immediately.\n    I am positioning.\n    If I am at (6,2), and he goes to (6,0).\n    We are in the same column.\n    If I go DOWN to (6,1), and he goes UP to (6,1), draw.\n    If he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he gets the apple.\n    If he gets the apple, I missed it.\n    So (6,2) allows him to take the apple.\n    So (6,2) is bad if I want to stop him from scoring.\n\n    If I go UP to (7,3):\n    I am at (7,3).\n    If he goes to (7,0), he gets the apple.\n    If I go to (8,2) (RIGHT), same thing.\n\n    So, it seems I cannot stop him from taking (7,0) without risking a draw.\n    And risking a draw is bad.\n    So I should let him have (7,0).\n    But I should take something else valuable.\n    (8,3) is the most valuable thing I can get quickly.\n\n    Is there a way to threaten him from (8,3)?\n    From (8,3), I can go DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3).\n    He is at (7,0).\n    I am far.\n\n    Wait, is there an apple at (9,7)? (9,6)? (9,4)?\n    (9,4) is close to (8,3).\n    If I eat (8,3), I can go to (9,4).\n    He is at (7,0).\n    He can go to (4,4) or (0,5).\n    If he goes to (4,4), he is far.\n    If he goes to (0,5), he is far.\n\n    The game is 150 turns. It's long.\n    Getting a score lead is important.\n    If I let him get 1-0, I am behind.\n    If I get 1-0, I can force collisions later.\n\n    How can I get 1-0?\n    I can't get (7,0) without draw.\n    Can I get another apple?\n    (8,3) is available.\n    (9,4) is available.\n    (4,4) is available.\n    (0,3) is available.\n\n    (8,3) is the closest one that is NOT (7,0).\n    Distance to (8,3): 2 steps.\n    Distance to (9,4): 3 steps.\n    Distance to (4,4): 5 steps.\n\n    So (8,3) is the best apple to secure a lead (or tie).\n\n    But wait! If he goes for (7,0), he gets 1 point.\n    If I go for (8,3), I get 1 point.\n    Score 1-1.\n    Now I am tied.\n    If I am tied, I should avoid head-on collisions.\n    But I can trap him.\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    He is at (5,0).\n    I am at (7,2).\n    If I move RIGHT to (8,2).\n    He moves RIGHT to (6,0).\n    Next turn:\n    I move UP to (8,3) (Eat). Score 1-1.\n    He moves RIGHT to (7,0) (Eat). Score 1-1.\n    Board state:\n    Me: Head (8,3), Body (8,2). Tail (7,2).\n    Him: Head (7,0), Body (6,0). Tail (5,0).\n    Now, where are we?\n    I am at top right (mostly). He is at bottom middle.\n    I can chase him.\n    But he has a body.\n    If I chase him, I have to be careful not to crash into his body.\n    Since we have equal score, head-on collision is a draw.\n    I want to win.\n    So I should avoid head-on collisions.\n\n    If I have equal score, I should try to trap him so he crashes into me.\n    \"If he crashes into you, he loses.\"\n    So I want him to run into my body.\n\n    Can I trap him from (8,3)?\n    He is at (7,0).\n    The board is 10x10.\n    He has plenty of space.\n\n    Is there a better move?\n    What if I go LEFT to (6,2)?\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), and he goes to (6,0).\n    Next turn:\n    I can go DOWN to (6,1).\n    He can go RIGHT to (7,0).\n    I am at (6,1). He is at (7,0).\n    I haven't eaten an apple. Score 0-0.\n    He ate the apple. Score 0-1.\n    I am behind.\n    This is bad.\n\n    So, I must get an apple.\n    And I must avoid the draw at (7,0).\n    So I must get a DIFFERENT apple.\n\n    The only apples reachable quickly are (8,3) and (9,4) and (4,4).\n    (8,3) is the easiest.\n\n    Is there a trap I can set?\n    If I go UP to (7,3), I am closer to the center.\n    From (7,3), I can go to (4,4) or (8,3).\n    (8,3) is closer.\n    So UP to (7,3) -> RIGHT to (8,3).\n    Same as RIGHT to (8,2) -> UP to (8,3).\n    Just a different order.\n\n    Let's consider the \"Box him in\" instruction again.\n    If I ignore him and get an apple, am I \"boxing him in\"?\n    No, I am expanding my territory.\n    But the prompt says \"Focus on enemy\".\n    Maybe I should attack him directly?\n    If I go LEFT to (6,2), I am attacking.\n    But I risk the draw (if he goes UP) or falling behind (if he goes RIGHT).\n    Falling behind is worse than a draw? Yes, because I lose if he reaches 30 and I don't.\n    A draw is a tie. Losing is losing.\n\n    So, securing points is crucial.\n    Therefore, I should go for (8,3).\n\n    Wait, looking at the prompt: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    This implies getting a higher score is a prerequisite for aggressive hunting.\n    So, step 1: Get points.\n    Step 2: Hunt.\n\n    So, I need to get an apple.\n    The safest way to get an apple is (8,3).\n\n    Let's double check if there are any apples I missed.\n    `APPLE DROPS: (9, 7), (4, 4), (9, 6), (0, 5), (9, 4), (5, 6), (8, 3), (0, 3), (7, 8), (6, 8), (4, 6), (6, 9), (7, 0), (3, 7), (0, 7)`\n    (8, 3) is there.\n    (7, 0) is there.\n    (9, 4) is there.\n    (4, 4) is there.\n\n    Okay, so the plan is:\n    1. Move to a safe spot that allows me to grab an apple next turn.\n    2. Avoid the (7,0) trap.\n\n    Which direction?\n    - RIGHT to (8,2): Safe. Next turn UP to (8,3).\n    - UP to (7,3): Safe. Next turn RIGHT to (8,3).\n    - LEFT to (6,2): Safe. Next turn? (6,3) or (5,2). No immediate apple.\n    - DOWN to (7,1): Safe. Next turn? (7,0) is apple but draw risk. (6,1) is safe but no apple.\n\n    So RIGHT or UP are the best options to secure an apple.\n    Between RIGHT and UP:\n    RIGHT (8,2) puts me closer to the edge (x=9).\n    UP (7,3) puts me more central.\n    (7,3) allows me to pivot to (4,4) later if I want, or (9,4).\n    (8,2) only allows me to pivot to (9,4) or (8,3) or (7,2).\n    (7,3) seems more flexible.\n\n    However, (8,2) is closer to (8,3) by 1 turn? No, both are 1 turn away from (8,3) if I count the current turn.\n    Wait:\n    Current pos (7,2).\n    Move RIGHT -> (8,2). Next turn UP -> (8,3). (2 turns total for apple).\n    Move UP -> (7,3). Next turn RIGHT -> (8,3). (2 turns total for apple).\n\n    They are equal in time to the apple.\n    But (7,3) is safer because it's further from the wall.\n    (8,2) is closer to the wall (x=9). If I get stuck, I have fewer moves.\n\n    So I will move UP to (7,3).\n\n    Plan for next turn:\n    Move UP to (7,3).\n    Then move RIGHT to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n    Secure the lead (or tie).\n\n    Wait, if I go UP to (7,3), I am moving away from the enemy.\n    The prompt says \"Focus on enemy\".\n    But \"Grow as a means of dominating\".\n    Growing allows dominating.\n    So growing is prioritized over immediate proximity to enemy, as long as I don't die.\n\n    Is (7,3) safe?\n    Board row 3: ` A . . . . . . . A . `\n    x=7 is empty. Safe.\n    Enemy at (5,0). Can't reach me.\n    Safe.\n\n    So, UP seems like the move.\n\n    Rationale:\n    - Avoiding the (7,0) trap to prevent a draw.\n    - Securing the apple at (8,3) to get points.\n    - Moving UP to (7,3) keeps options open and is safer than (8,2).\n    - Preparing to dominate by growing.\n\n    Final check:\n    If I go UP to (7,3).\n    If he goes RIGHT to (6,0).\n    Next turn I go RIGHT to (8,3) (Eat). He goes RIGHT to (7,0) (Eat).\n    1-1 tie.\n    I am at (8,3). He is at (7,0).\n    I can chase him.\n    If I have equal score, I avoid head-on collisions.\n    I can try to trap him against the wall.\n    He is at (7,0). If I approach, he can go UP or LEFT.\n    If I am at (8,3), I can move to (7,3) or (8,4) or (9,3).\n    To trap him, I need to cut off his escape.\n    This is possible later.\n\n    If I go UP to (7,3).\n    If he goes UP to (5,1).\n    Next turn I go RIGHT to (8,3). He goes to (5,2) or (4,1).\n    He didn't take (7,0). Why?\n    Maybe he is going for (4,4) or (0,5).\n    If he ignores (7,0), I can take it later?\n    (7,0) is an apple. If he doesn't take it, it's there.\n    But if I am at (8,3), I am far from (7,0).\n    If he doesn't take (7,0), it's still available.\n    But (8,3) is closer to me currently than (7,0).\n    (7,0) requires me to go DOWN twice.\n    (8,3) requires me to go UP once.\n    So (8,3) is the logical target.\n\n    What if he goes UP to (5,1) and I go UP to (7,3)?\n    He gives up (7,0).\n    On turn 2, I go to (8,3). He goes to (5,2).\n    I have 1 apple. He has 0.\n    Now I have the lead.\n    I can hunt him.\n    I can force head-on collisions.\n    I can try to box him in.\n\n    This sounds like a winning strategy.\n    Get the lead -> Hunt -> Win.\n\n    So, the move is UP.\n\n    One detail: \"Do not focus on where the apples are.\"\n    I am focusing on (8,3).\n    But the context is \"Focus on enemy... Grow as a means\".\n    I am growing to be able to focus on the enemy effectively.\n    So it's consistent.\n\n    Let's write the responseYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Welcome back to the stream! We're LIVE and turn 0 is here! Let's break down the board.\n\nWe're at (7, 2) and the enemy is at (5, 0). He's stuck in the bottom-left corner, but that apple at (7, 0) is tempting him. If I rush for it, we might crash into each other and tie. That's not content! I want the win.\n\nSo, here's the plan: I'm ignoring the trap at (7, 0) for now. I'm going UP to (7, 3). This sets me up perfectly to grab the apple at (8, 3) next turn. This gets me a point (or ties me up) safely, and then I can start hunting him down with a lead.\n\nWe're playing the long game, chat. Secure the bag first, then box him in.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (7, 3) to secure a path to the apple at (8, 3). Once I have the lead, I'll start pressuring the enemy and forcing him into bad spots.\n\nUP",

Let's see what happened.\n\nThe scoreboard shows we're still 0-0, and looking at the board state... wait a second. The board update shows the enemy snake #0 is still at (6, 0)? Let me check the map.\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . . . A A . .\n 7 A . . A . . . . . A\n 6 . . . . A A . . . A\n 5 A . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . A . . . .

The enemy is at (6, 0) (that's the \"0\" on row 0). The apple at (7, 0) is still there.\n\nWait, looking at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list: `(9, 7), (4, 4), (9, 6), (0, 5), (9, 4), (5, 6), (8, 3), (0, 3), (7, 8), (6, 8), (4, 6), (6, 9), (7, 0), (3, 7), (0, 7)`.\n\nThe apple at (8, 3) that I was planning to grab... looking at the board map at row 3: `A . . . . . . 1 A .`\nWait, let me index that carefully.\nRow 3: `A . . . . . . 1 A .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt index 8, there is an \"A\"! Yes! (8, 3) is an apple.\n\nBut hold on... my head is at (7, 3). I am literally right next to it!\nMy current position is (7, 3).\nPossible moves:\n1.  RIGHT to (8, 3): **Apple!** I eat it, grow, and get +1 point.\n2.  UP to (7, 4): Empty.\n3.  LEFT to (6, 3): Empty.\n4.  DOWN to (7, 2): My previous tail, but since I didn't eat, my tail moves to where my head was. So (7, 2) will be empty? No, wait. I am length 1. If I move, my body follows. If I move to (8, 3), my tail stays at (7, 3). If I move UP, my tail goes to (7, 3).\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 0). He is safe at the bottom.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Is there an apple? Yes. Is it occupied by enemy body? No (enemy is at 6,0). Is it occupied by my body? No (I have no body yet, or my body is just the tail moving). **SAFE.**\n*   **UP to (7, 4):** Map shows ` . . . . A . . . . A` at row 4. x=7 is empty. **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):** Map shows ` . . . . . . . 1 A .` wait, x=6 on row 3 is a dot. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):** Map shows ` . . . . . . . . . .` at row 2. **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategy Check:**\nThe prompt says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\" BUT, it also says \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point.\" and \"Among remaining SAFE moves, favor moves that... move you CLOSER to reachable apples\".\n\nHowever, I am literally on top of an apple (adjacent). If I take it, I get a point.\nIf I get a point, I have a higher score.\n\"If you have a higher score... Try to force a head-on collision.\"\nGetting the apple puts me ahead. That allows me to play aggressively later.\n\nIf I don't take the apple:\nI stay at 0 points. The apple remains on the board. The enemy might try to get it later? He is at (6,0), (8,3) is far for him. He would have to move UP and RIGHT.\n\nIf I take the apple:\nI am at (8, 3), length 2 (head 8,3, tail 7,3). Score 1-0.\nThe enemy is at (6, 0).\nI have the lead. I can start positioning to cut him off.\n\n**Comparison of options:**\n*   **RIGHT (Eat Apple):** +1 Score. Grow. Good start. Secure the lead immediately.\n*   **UP (Ignore Apple):** Stay 0-0. Move to (7,4). Why? To go where? I'm moving away from the enemy, but also away from the apple.\n*   **LEFT:** Move away from apple and enemy.\n*   **DOWN:** Move away from apple and enemy.\n\nThe only move that gives immediate benefit (score) and keeps options open is RIGHT.\nIs it risky? The enemy moves simultaneously. If I go RIGHT to (8, 3), could the enemy somehow crash into me? No, he is at (6,0). He can't reach (8,3) in one turn.\nCould I crash into him? No.\n\nWhat about the rule \"Do not focus on apples\"?\nThe context implies \"Don't greedily chase apples if it puts you in danger\". Here, eating the apple is the safest move. It's not greed; it's free points. It also extends my body, which is useful for blocking later.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves from (6,0).\nHe can go UP (6,1), LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0).\nIf he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he eats an apple!\nWait, looking at the map row 0: ` . . . . . 0 A . . .`\nAt x=7 there is an \"A\". If he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he gets a point!\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,3), I get a point.\nWe would both get points.\nScore 1-1.\nBut wait, if he goes RIGHT to (7,0), he moves into the apple. He grows.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,3), I move into the apple. I grow.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to take the apple?\nIf I go UP to (7,4), I don't grow. He might take (7,0) or (8,3) later.\nIf I take (8,3) now, I guarantee the point.\nThe prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score.\"\nGetting the first point is crucial for the \"higher score\" advantage later.\n\nSo, I will take the apple.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (8, 3) to eat the apple.\n2.  Secure the lead (1-0).\n3.  Prepare to pressure the enemy who is stuck at the bottom.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nChat, look at the map! I'm literally standing next to an apple at (8, 3). The enemy is way down at (6, 0). He might be going for the apple at (7, 0), or he might be trying to climb up.\n\nIf I take the apple at (8, 3), I get +1 point. That puts me in the lead. The prompt says if I have a higher score, I should try to force head-on collisions. I want that advantage!\n\nIf I ignore the apple and go UP or LEFT, I'm playing passive. The enemy might eat (7, 0) and tie us up, or worse, get ahead. I need to secure the bag first.\n\nSo, I'm going RIGHT to (8, 3). I eat the apple, I grow, and I start the game with a lead. Then I can start hunting him down.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:** Secure lead -> Cut off his path to the center -> Box him in against the wall.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "START LAST RATIONALE  \nChat, we are at (8, 4). The board shows apples at (9, 7), (4, 4), (9, 6), (0, 5), (9, 4), (5, 6), (0, 3), (7, 8), (6, 8), (4, 6), (6, 9), (3, 7), (0, 7), (2, 1), (0, 9). My body is (8, 3), tail (8, 2). Enemy snake #0 is at (7, 1) with body (7, 0). I have 1 apple, enemy has 1 apple. I need to aggressively position to dominate the board and potentially force a head-on collision since scores are tied.  \n\nLet's analyze moves:  \n- UP to (8, 5): Currently empty (check board: row 5 has an apple at (9, 4)? Actually (9,4) is an apple, but (8,5) is empty). This move keeps me away from the enemy (who is at y=1). It moves me toward the center-right area, opening up access to apples like (9,4) and (9,6) and (9,7). Safe, and multiple follow-ups available.  \n- DOWN to (8, 3): That's my current body! So moving down into (8, 3) is moving into my own body, which is illegal (would kill me). So DOWN is not safe.  \n- LEFT to (7, 4): Empty? Check board: row 4 has apple at (4,4) and (9,4), but (7,4) is empty. However, this moves me closer to the enemy's possible path. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,1) or UP to (7,2), we might collide later. But immediate safety is okay.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 4): That cell has an apple! (9,4) is listed. Moving onto an apple grows me and scores a point. However, we must consider if it's safe: It's empty except for the apple. But we also need to consider simultaneous moves. Could the enemy head move into (9,4) as well? Enemy is at (7,1); they cannot reach (9,4) in one move (would need to move right then right again). So likely safe. However, moving into (9,4) puts me in a corner (9,4) which is near the top-right corner. From there, my next moves would be limited: left to (8,4) (occupied by my body? Wait, after moving, my head is at (9,4), body becomes [(8,4), (8,3)]? Actually, after eating apple, I grow: new body is (8,4) and (8,3)? Let's simulate: Current head (8,4), body [(8,3)]. If I move RIGHT to (9,4) and eat apple, I grow: new head (9,4), new body [(8,4), (8,3)] (since tail doesn't move this turn? Actually in snake games, when you eat, you add a segment, so tail stays, and head moves. So new body length increases by 1). That means my old head position (8,4) becomes part of body. So from (9,4), I can only go LEFT (to (8,4) which is now my body) or DOWN (to (9,3))? DOWN to (9,3) is empty? Check board: row 3 has apple at (0,3) and tail at (8,3) which is my body, but (9,3) is empty. Actually (8,3) is my current body, but (9,3) is not listed as occupied. So DOWN is possible. But LEFT is into my own body. UP to (9,5) is empty? Check row 5: (9,5) empty. So after eating, I have at least two safe directions: DOWN and UP. That's okay.\n\nBut compare to UP to (8,5): That also safe, and I don't get an apple immediately, but I maintain more options. I could go to (9,5) next, etc. Actually moving UP to (8,5) keeps me in a central position with more flexibility. I can later go to (9,5) or (8,6) etc.  \n\nConsidering the long-term plan: I want to dominate the board and cut off the enemy. The enemy is currently at (7,1) and likely will move UP or RIGHT to get apples. There's an apple at (2,1) but that's far. Actually (2,1) is an apple on row 1. The enemy might go for that. My position on the right side can block the right side.  \n\nGiven that scores are tied, I could go for the apple at (9,4) now to get ahead and grow, but that might trap me in the corner. However, I'm still early in the game (turn 3/150). Growing is important for future battles. But I also want to keep options open.  \n\nLet's evaluate safety for each move:  \n- UP: (8,5) empty -> safe.  \n- DOWN: (8,3) is my body -> death.  \n- LEFT: (7,4) empty -> safe.  \n- RIGHT: (9,4) has apple -> safe (unless enemy also goes there, which is very unlikely).  \n\nSo three safe moves. Among them, which gives the most aggressive future positioning? I want to head towards the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at (7,1). If I move LEFT to (7,4), I get closer horizontally, but I'm above him. If he moves UP multiple times, we could meet. If I move UP, I stay on the right side, which is my territory.  \n\nAlso note that there's an apple at (9,4) right there. Taking it gives me +1 point and I become size 3 (since I'm currently size 2? Actually head (8,4) and body (8,3) so size 2. Eating grows to size 3). That could be good for scoring. But I'm also aware that apples are plentiful; there are many apples on the board. Taking one now might not be critical, but it's there.  \n\nHowever, the game is about denying the enemy. If I don't take the apple, the enemy might eventually get it? Not likely from his position. But if I leave it, it might be used later.  \n\nGiven the instruction: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" Currently tied, so I don't have higher score yet. So I should aim to get ahead if possible safely.  \n\nBut also: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\" So growing is secondary to positioning.  \n\nI think moving UP to (8,5) is a strong strategic move. It puts me on a path to move towards the top-right apples (9,7) etc., and keeps me flexible. I can always go for (9,4) later if it's still there.  \n\nAlso, moving UP avoids moving into a corner.  \n\nLet's check if moving UP to (8,5) is blocked by anything: The board shows row 5 has (9,4) as apple, but (8,5) is not listed as occupied. So it's empty.  \n\nThus, I'll go UP.  \n\nNow, for the future plan: I'll write a short plan for the next turn.  \n\nI need to output the final move on its own line.  \n\nSo:  \nSTART LAST RATIONALE  \n[explanation]  \nEND LAST RATIONALE  \nUP  \n\nBut the user expects \"START LAST RATIONALE\" and \"END LAST RATIONALE\" tags? In the example, they had that. So I should include them.  \n\nI'll produce:  \n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE  \nChat, I'm at (8,4) and considering all moves. DOWN is into my own body, so instant death. LEFT to (7,4) is safe but brings me closer to the enemy's vertical axis. RIGHT to (9,4) gets an apple but traps me slightly in the corner. UP to (8,5) is safe, keeps me central, and gives me multiple future options. Since scores are tied, I want to position for future aggression and block the enemy. I'll climb up and prepare to cut off the top-right area.  \nEND LAST RATIONALE  \nUP  \n\nBut I should also include a plan note? The instruction says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\" So I should include a plan note within the rationale? Actually, the \"plan\" is the rationale itself? In the example, the last rationale was the explanation. It says \"this plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\" So maybe I need to include a separate plan line? But the instruction says \"Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\" So I can add a line like \"Plan: Move UP to (8,5) then consider heading to (9,5) or (8,6) to control the right side.\" That would be part of the rationale? Actually, the example didn't have a separate plan line; the rationale itself was the plan. I think the rationale serves as the plan for the next turn. So I'll keep the rationale as is.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll include a clear plan statement within the rationale.\n\nLet's craft:\n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE  \nChat, we're at (8,4). Immediate safety check: DOWN is (8,3) \u2013 that's my own body, so instant death. LEFT to (7,4) is empty but puts me directly above the enemy's potential path (he's at (7,1), could move up). RIGHT to (9,4) has an apple, but (9,4) is a corner-adjacent cell \u2013 after eating, I'd be at (9,4) with body [(8,4),(8,3)], limiting my next moves to UP or DOWN (since LEFT is my body).

          "rationale": "START LAST RATIONALE  \nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's break this down. My snake (ID 1) is at head (8,5) with body [(8,4)]. I have 1 apple, opponent Snake #0 has 1 apple. We're tied, so no score advantage yet. I need to play smart and aggressive.  \n\nLet's evaluate the four moves from my head at (8,5):  \n1. UP to (8,6): Check the board. Row 6: columns: 0:A, 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:A, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:A. So (8,6) is empty. Safe move.  \n2. DOWN to (8,4): That's my own body! Immediately dies. NOPE.  \n3. LEFT to (7,5): Row 5: (7,5) is empty (only apple at (9,4) and I'm at (8,5)). Safe.  \n4. RIGHT to (9,5): Row 5: (9,5) is empty. Safe.  \n\nSo I have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nNow, which one gives me the best aggression and board control?  \n- LEFT to (7,5) brings me closer to the opponent, who is at (7,2) with body [(7,1)]. That could set up a potential head-on clash if he moves UP. But moving left also puts me on his vertical axis, which might be risky if I'm not bigger yet.  \n- RIGHT to (9,5) moves me along the right wall. That's interesting because there are apples on the right: (9,4) is an apple (but I'm at (8,5) now, not (8,4) anymore, wait careful: current head is (8,5), so (9,5) is empty). From there I could go DOWN to (9,4) next turn to eat the apple, or UP toward (9,6) and (9,7). However, right now I'm not on an apple.  \n- UP to (8,6): This moves me up toward the top-right apples: (9,6), (9,7), (6,9), etc. It keeps me central but not too close to the opponent.  \n\nI need to think about the opponent's likely move. Opponent at (7,2) with body [(7,1)]. They could go UP to (7,3), RIGHT to (8,2), LEFT to (6,2), or DOWN to (7,1) which is their body (die). So they might go UP or RIGHT. If they go UP, they move closer to the center. If they go RIGHT, they go to (8,2). My move LEFT to (7,5) would put me at (7,5) and they could be at (7,3) or (8,2) \u2013 not an immediate collision this turn, but could set up later.  \n\nGiven that scores are tied, I want to start growing. I should try to get an apple soon. There's an apple at (9,4) that's reachable: from (8,5) I can't get it this turn, but from (9,5) I could go DOWN next turn. However, from (8,6) I could go RIGHT to (9,6) next turn (which is an apple) or DOWN to (8,5) but that's my previous head? Actually if I move UP to (8,6), my body becomes [(8,5), (8,4)]. So (8,5) is now part of my body, so I can't go back there. So from (8,6), I could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (to (8,5) which is body \u2013 that would be backwards, which is illegal). So DOWN is not safe. So from (8,6), I'd have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That's still good.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,5), my body becomes [(8,5), (8,4)]. From (7,5), I could go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But DOWN to (7,4) is empty? Row 4: (7,4) is empty (only apples at (4,4) and (9,4)). So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (6,5) is empty? Row 5: (6,5) is empty. So many options.  \n\nBut the key is aggression. The opponent is at (7,2). I want to cut him off. Moving LEFT to (7,5) puts me on the same vertical column, but I'm above him. If he moves UP multiple times, we could meet. However, I'm not yet bigger than him. I don't have a size advantage. So forcing a head-on collision now is risky because if we tie, both die? Wait: If two heads move into the same cell, both die. If I have equal score, we'd both die, and the game ends with draw? Actually if all snakes die, game ends immediately. If both die at the same time, and scores are tied, it's a draw. Not ideal. I want to win. So I should avoid head-on until I have a size advantage.  \n\nThus, I should focus on growing first. Get that apple.  \n\nNow, from (8,5), which move gives me the quickest access to an apple?  \n- RIGHT to (9,5): then next turn I could go DOWN to (9,4) to eat that apple. That's two moves to get the apple.  \n- UP to (8,6): then next turn I could go RIGHT to (9,6) to eat apple at (9,6). That's also two moves.  \n- LEFT to (7,5): then next turn I could go UP to (7,6) and then maybe to (6,6) etc., but there's an apple at (5,6) and (4,6). That might be three moves away.  \n\nSo both RIGHT and UP give similar access to apples. However, RIGHT moves me to the edge (column 9). That might limit my future options: from (9,5), I can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is off board). That's still three options, which is fine. But if I get trapped later, being on the edge could be bad. UP to (8,6) keeps me one step away from the edge, giving me more flexibility.  \n\nAlso, consider the opponent's potential movement. If I go RIGHT to (9,5), I'm moving away from the opponent, which might give him more room in the center. If I go UP, I'm moving toward the center-right, which could be a good position to later shift left if needed.  \n\nGiven the board state: There's an apple at (9,6) and (9,7) above. So moving UP to (8,6) puts me directly below (9,6). Next turn I can go RIGHT to (9,6) and eat an apple. That seems efficient.  \n\nAlso, the board has apples at (6,9) and (6,8) and (7,8) etc., so moving UP gets me closer to those as well.  \n\nI'll go UP to (8,6). This is safe, and sets up for apple consumption next turn. I'll be size 3 after eating (since I'll have head (9,6), body [(8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]). That gives me a size advantage over the opponent who is still size 2 (head (7,2), body (7,1)). Then I can consider aggressive maneuvers.  \n\nLong-term plan: Once I have a size advantage, I can start positioning to cut off the opponent's path to apples and force a head-on collision on my terms. For now, focus on getting that apple at (9,6) and maintaining board control on the right side.  \n\nEND LAST RATIONALE  \nUP",

We're both size 2. Time to be AGGRESSIVE and start dominating. \n\nFirst, check all moves from my head (8,6):\n- UP to (8,7): Board shows (8,7) is empty? Row 7: A . . A . . . . . A \u2192 columns: 0:A,1:.,2:.,3:A,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:.,8:.,9:A. So (8,7) is empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (8,5): That's my own body! (My body includes (8,5)). That's a crash. \u274c\n- LEFT to (7,6): Row 6: . . . . A A . . 1 A \u2192 (7,6) is empty (since (7,6) is after (7,5) empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): Row 6: (9,6) is an APPLE! A at (9,6). So moving RIGHT would eat the apple. Safe AND beneficial.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\nNow, which gives the BEST aggression and future options? \n- RIGHT to (9,6) eats an apple immediately. That would give me size 3 (head (9,6), body [(8,6), (8,5)]) and I'd have 2 apples. This gives me a score advantage (2 vs 1) and size advantage. Crucial for forcing head-on collisions later!\n- UP to (8,7) is safe but doesn't get an apple. From there, I could go RIGHT to (9,7) next turn (which is also an apple) or UP to (8,8) etc. But why wait when I can get an apple NOW?\n- LEFT to (7,6) moves toward the center, but no immediate apple. Could be strategic to cut off opponent's path to apples? But opponent is at (7,3) below, not an immediate threat.\n\nConsidering opponent's likely move: They're at (7,3) with body (7,2). They could go UP to (7,4), RIGHT to (8,3), LEFT to (6,3), or DOWN to (7,2) which is body (death). They might chase apples too. There's an apple at (4,4) to their left-up, and (9,4) to their right. But if I go RIGHT to (9,6), I'm on the right edge, away from them. That's fine for now.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Get the apple at (9,6) NOW to gain size and score advantage. Then next turn, from (9,6), I can explore UP to (9,7) (another apple!) or LEFT to (8,6) (but that's my body after this move? Wait: after moving to (9,6), my body becomes [(8,6), (8,5)]. So (8,6) is now my body. So from (9,6), I cannot go LEFT to (8,6) because that's my own body. So my safe moves from (9,6) would be UP, RIGHT (off board? column 9 is max, so RIGHT is invalid), DOWN (to (9,5) empty), LEFT (into body? (8,6) is body, so LEFT is death). So actually from (9,6), I'd be trapped if I go RIGHT to eat apple? Let's check: (9,6) is on the right edge (x=9). From there, I can go UP to (9,7) (apple), DOWN to (9,5) (empty), LEFT to (8,6) (my body after this move), RIGHT is off board. So LEFT is death. So I'd have only UP and DOWN safe. That's only 2 options, which is still okay. But I'd be on the edge. However, that's manageable. I could then go UP to (9,7) next turn to eat another apple and grow further. That would be size 4 and 3 apples. \n\nIf I go UP to (8,7) instead, I'd have more space: from (8,7), I can go UP to (8,8), LEFT to (7,7), RIGHT to (9,7) (apple), DOWN to (8,6) (my body after move? Actually after moving UP to (8,7), my body becomes [(8,6), (8,5)]. So (8,6) is body. So DOWN would be into body, death. So from (8,7), safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (to apple). That's 3 options. \n\nBut the apple at (9,6) is RIGHT now. I can take it immediately. That's a guaranteed point and size increase. I think it's worth the slight edge risk because I'll still have two safe moves next turn.\n\nLet's also consider opponent's potential head-on collision. If I go RIGHT to (9,6) and opponent goes RIGHT to (8,3) maybe? No collision. If opponent goes UP and eventually to the right, we might meet later, but I'll be bigger.\n\nDecision: RIGHT to (9,6) to eat the apple. This gives me immediate advantage. Let's GOOOO!\n\nFinal move: RIGHTRIGHT",

My body: [(8,6), (8,5)]. Opponent is at (7,4) with body [(7,3)] and 1 apple. Board size 10x10. Let's check all moves from my head (9,6):  \n\n- **UP to (9,7)**: Board shows apple at (9,7) from the list! Row 7: A at (9,7) indeed. That's safe and would give me another apple \u2192 size 4, 3 apples. From (9,7), I'd have: UP to (9,8) empty, LEFT to (8,7) empty, DOWN to (9,6) (my body after move? Wait: after moving UP to (9,7), body becomes [(9,6), (8,6)]. So (9,6) is body, so DOWN is into body \u2192 death. So from (9,7), safe: UP, LEFT. Two options.  \n- **DOWN to (9,5)**: Row 5: A . . . . . . . T . \u2192 (9,5) is 'T' (opponent's tail? Actually opponent's body is [(7,3)], so (9,5) is empty? Wait, board row 5: \"A . . . . . . . T .\" \u2192 columns 0-9: (9,5) is '.'? Let's read: \"T .\" at the end? Actually row 5 string: \"A . . . . . . . T .\" means (8,5) is 'T'? No, check the board again: row 5 is \"A . . . . . . . T .\". So positions: (0,5): A, (1,5): ., (2,5): ., (3,5): ., (4,5): ., (5,5): ., (6,5): ., (7,5): ., (8,5): T, (9,5): . . So (9,5) is empty. Safe move. From there, I can go UP to (9,6) (my body after move? After moving DOWN to (9,5), body becomes [(9,6), (8,6)]. So (9,6) is body, so UP is death. LEFT to (8,5) is body? (8,5) is my body after move, so LEFT is death. DOWN to (9,4) is empty? (9,4) is 'A' from apple list? Actually apple at (9,4) exists, but board row 4: \"... A .\" at end, so (9,4) is A. So DOWN to (9,4) is apple. RIGHT is off board. So from (9,5), safe moves: DOWN (to apple). Only one safe move? Actually LEFT is into body, UP into body, RIGHT off board, so only DOWN safe. That's a trap! Don't go into a dead end.  \n- **LEFT to (8,6)**: That's my own body! (My body includes (8,6)). Crash. \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (10,6)**: Off board! Death. \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves: UP (to apple) and DOWN (to empty but trap). UP is better because it gets an apple and from (9,7) I still have two safe moves (UP to (9,8) empty, LEFT to (8,7) empty). DOWN is a trap with only one safe move.  \n\n**Consider opponent's move:** They're at (7,4). They might go for apples. There's an apple at (9,4) to their right, (4,4) up-left, (0,5) etc. If I go UP to (9,7), they might not reach me immediately. But I need to dominate.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat apple at (9,7) to get 3 apples and size 4. Then from (9,7), I can go LEFT to (8,7) to get more space, avoiding the edge trap. Force collisions later when I'm bigger.  \n\nFinal move: UP",

We're at turn 7, I'm leading 3-1 in apples and my head is at (9,7) after eating the apple last turn (I went UP from (9,6) to (9,7) as planned). My body: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5)]. Opponent is at (8,4) with body [(7,4)] and 1 apple. Board size 10x10. Let's check all moves from my head (9,7):  \n\n- **UP to (9,8)**: Row 8: . . . . . . A A . . \u2192 (9,8) is empty ('.'). Safe. From (9,8), I can go UP to (9,9) empty? Row 9: 9 A . . . . . A . . . \u2192 (9,9) is '.' (since last is '.' after the A at (7,9)? Actually row 9 string: \"9 A . . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 columns: (0,9):9? Wait the board shows \"9 A . . . . . A . . .\" but that's just the row label. The actual cells: (0,9) is 'A' (from the 'A' after 9), (1,9): ., (2,9): ., (3,9): ., (4,9): ., (5,9): ., (6,9): ., (7,9): A, (8,9): ., (9,9): . So (9,9) is empty.

DOWN to (9,7) is my body after move? After moving UP to (9,8), body becomes [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6)]. So (9,7) is body, so DOWN is death. RIGHT off board. So safe moves from (9,8): UP, LEFT. Two options.  \n- **DOWN to (9,6)**: That's my own body (since after move, body includes (9,6) as the tail? Actually current body: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5)]. After moving DOWN to (9,6), my new body would be [(9,6) (current head becomes body? Wait, movement: head moves to new cell, old head becomes first body segment. So current head (9,7) becomes body, tail moves. New body: [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6)]. So (9,6) is body, so moving DOWN into (9,6) would be moving into my own body (since the head would go to (9,6) which is currently body and will be body after move? Actually simultaneous move: we move at same time. After my move, my head is at (9,6), but that cell was occupied by my own body before move. That's a crash. So DEATH. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (8,7)**: Row 7: A . . A . . . . . 1 \u2192 (8,7) is empty ('.'). Safe. From (8,7), body becomes [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6)]. From (8,7), safe moves: UP to (8,8) (empty), DOWN to (8,6) (body after move? (8,6) is body, so DOWN death), LEFT to (7,7) (empty? Row 7: (7,7) is '.'), RIGHT to (9,7) (body after move). So safe moves: UP, LEFT. Two options.  \n- **RIGHT to (10,7)**: Off board! Death. \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves: UP (to (9,8)) and LEFT (to (8,7)). Both give two follow-up safe moves. DOWN is death, RIGHT off board.  \n\nNow consider opponent's move: Snake #0 at (8,4) with body [(7,4)]. Apples: they have 1. There's an apple at (9,4) to their right, (4,4) up-left, (0,5) etc. They might go RIGHT to (9,4) (apple) or UP to (8,5) (empty? Row 5: (8,5) is 'T'? Wait row 5: \"A . . . . . . . T .\" \u2192 (8,5) is 'T' (opponent's tail? Actually opponent's body is [(7,4)], so (8,5) is empty? The 'T' might be a typo? In the board, 'T' denotes opponent's tail? But opponent's tail is (7,4) and body only has (7,4) so tail is same as body? Actually snake #0 body is [(7,4)], so tail is (7,4) too. So (8,5) is empty. So opponent could go UP to (8,5) or RIGHT to (9,4) (apple). They might also go LEFT to (7,4) but that's into their own body? Their body is (7,4), so LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4) is into their own body \u2192 death. So they likely won't do that. They could go DOWN to (8,3) (row 3: A A . . . . A . . . \u2192 (8,3) is '.'? Row 3: \"A A . . . . A . . .\" \u2192 (8,3) is '.'? Actually columns: (0,3):A, (1,3):A, (2,3):., (3,3):., (4,3):., (5,3):., (6,3):A, (7,3):., (8,3):., (9,3):. So (8,3) is empty. So possible.  \n\nIf I go UP to (9,8), opponent might go RIGHT to (9,4) and I'm far away. No immediate collision. If I go LEFT to (8,7), opponent might go UP to (8,5) and we're on same x but different y. No collision.  \n\nLong-term plan: We're leading 3-1. We want to box in opponent and force collision when we're bigger. From (9,8) or (8,7), I can move towards the center to control more space. (9,8) keeps me near the edge but with two exits. (8,7) is more central. I prefer (8,7) to dominate the board and cut off opponent's access to apples in the top-right. Also, from (8,7), I can later go to (7,7) or (8,8) which are empty.  \n\nBut let's check apple drops: There's an apple at (7,8) and (6,8) and (4,6) etc. From (8,7), I'm closer to (7,8) (apple) and (6,8) (apple). From (9,8), I'm closer to (9,9) and (8,8). (8,8) is empty, (9,9) empty. No immediate apple for either safe move.  \n\nI need to avoid getting trapped. (9,8) is on the edge with only two moves (UP, LEFT). (8,7) is not on edge and has two moves (UP, LEFT). Both similar. But (8,7) gives more central control.  \n\nAlso, consider if opponent goes for (9,4) apple, they grow to size 2 and 2 apples. Still behind. I need to keep growing and eventually force head-on collision.  \n\nDecision: I'll go LEFT to (8,7) to move towards center and prepare to box opponent in the bottom-right.  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** From (8,7), next turn move LEFT to (7,7) to approach the apple at (7,8) or (6,8). Force opponent into a corner.  \n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT  \nEND LAST RATIONALE  \n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):  \nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're at turn 8, leading 3-2 in apples. My head at (8,7), body [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6)]. Opponent head (9,4), body [(8,4), (7,4)]. Board size 10x10. Let's evaluate moves from (8,7):\n\n- **UP to (8,8)**: Row 8: . . . . . . A A . . \u2192 (8,8) is empty ('.'). Safe. From (8,8), body becomes [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]. Safe moves: UP to (8,9) (row 9: (8,9) is '.'), LEFT to (7,8) (apple! Row 8: (7,8) is 'A'), DOWN to (8,7) (body after move), RIGHT off board? (9,8) is '.'? Actually (9,8) is '.' from row 8? Row 8: columns: (6,8):A, (7,8):A, (8,8):., (9,8):. So (9,8) is empty. But RIGHT from (8,8) to (9,8) is safe? Wait, (9,8) is empty, so RIGHT is safe. So from (8,8), safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three options). Nice!  \n- **DOWN to (8,6)**: That's my own body (current body includes (8,6) as tail). After move, head goes to (8,6), which is currently occupied by my tail. That's a crash. DEATH. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (7,7)**: Row 7: A . . A . . . . . 1 \u2192 (7,7) is empty ('.'). Safe. Body becomes [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6)]. From (7,7), safe moves: UP to (7,8) (apple! Row 8: (7,8) is 'A'), DOWN to (7,6) (row 6: (7,6) is '.'? Row 6: . . . . A A . . T T \u2192 (7,6) is '.'), LEFT to (6,7) (empty? Row 7: (6,7) is '.'), RIGHT to (8,7) (body after move). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (three options). Also good!  \n- **RIGHT to (9,7)**: That's my own body (current body includes (9,7)). After move, head to (9,7) which is currently occupied. DEATH. \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves: UP to (8,8) or LEFT to (7,7). Both give three follow-up safe moves. DOWN and RIGHT are death.  \n\nNow consider opponent's move: Snake #0 at (9,4) with body [(8,4), (7,4)]. Apples: 2. They might go RIGHT to (9,5)? Row 5: (9,5) is '.'? Row 5: \"A . . . . . . . T .\" \u2192 (8,5) is 'T' (tail?), (9,5) is '.'? Actually row 5: (0,5):A, (1,5):., (2,5):., (3,5):., (4,5):., (5,5):., (6,5):., (7,5):., (8,5):T, (9,5):. So (9,5) is empty. They could go UP to (9,5) or LEFT to (8,4) (into their own body? Their body is (8,4), so LEFT from (9,4) to (8,4) is into their own body \u2192 death). They could go DOWN to (9,3) (row 3: (9,3) is '.'), or UP to (9,5). They might also go for apple at (9,4) is empty? No apple at (9,4) currently. Apple list: (9,4) not listed. So they might move towards apples.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8,8), I'm far from opponent. If I go LEFT to (7,7), I'm closer to center. I want to box opponent in. Opponent is in bottom-right corner (9,4). By moving LEFT to (7,7), I can cut off their path to top-left apples and force them towards edges. From (7,7), I can eventually go to (7,8) (apple) or (6,7) etc.  \n\nBut UP to (8,8) also gives access to apple at (7,8) via LEFT. Both moves are strong. However, from (8,8), I have RIGHT to (9,8) which is empty, giving more flexibility. But (8,8) is on the top edge? Row 8 is near top (y=8, max y=9). So UP to (8,8) might limit upward moves later. (7,7) is more central.  \n\nAlso, opponent might be going for apple at (0,5) or (4,4) but they're far. I need to grow and dominate. I'll go LEFT to (7,7) to approach the apple at (7,8) and control the center.  \n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: From (7,7), next turn move UP to (7,8) to eat the apple and grow to size 4, then head towards opponent's side. Force head-on collision when we have more mass!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT",

They can't reach (7,8) in one move (distance 2+). So UP is safe and gives growth. From (7,8) next turn, safe moves: check surroundings: (7,9) is empty ('.' from row 9), (6,8) is apple? Row 8: (6,8) is 'A', (7,8) is 'A' (we're eating it), (8,8) is '.', (7,7) will be body. So after eating, (7,8) head, body behind. Safe moves: UP to (7,9), LEFT to (6,8) (apple), DOWN to (7,7) (body), RIGHT to (8,8) (empty). That's 3 safe options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good!\n- **DOWN to (7,6)**: Row 6: (7,6) is '.' empty. Safe? Check opponent: They can't reach (7,6) in one move. But is there any threat? After move, body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7)]. From (7,6), safe moves: UP to (7,7) (body), DOWN to (7,5) (row 5: (7,5) is '.'), LEFT to (6,6) (row 6: (6,6) is '.'), RIGHT to (8,6) (row 6: (8,6) is '.'? Row 6: ... A A . . T T \u2192 columns: (6,6) is '.', (7,6) is '.', (8,6) is '.', (9,6) is tail). So (8,6) is empty. So from (7,6), safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three options). Also good. But no immediate growth.\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: Row 7: (6,7) is '.' empty. Safe. Body becomes [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7)]. From (6,7), safe moves: UP to (6,8) (apple), DOWN to (6,6) (empty), LEFT to (5,7) (row 7: (5,7) is '.'), RIGHT to (7,7) (body). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (three options). Good, and leads to apple at (6,8) next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: That's my own body (current body includes (8,7)). After move, head to (8,7) which is occupied \u2192 DEATH. \u274c\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. All give three follow-up safe moves. But UP gives immediate apple growth (score becomes 4-2), increasing our lead and size. DOWN and LEFT don't give apples this turn.\n\nStrategically: We're leading in apples. Opponent is at (9,5), likely moving towards apples like (0,5) or (4,4) but far. By eating the apple at (7,8), we grow, get closer to top-right area, and can start boxing opponent in from the north. Opponent might be trapped in bottom-right if we cut off their paths. From (7,8), we can later move left towards (6,8) apple or up to (7,9), controlling the top edge.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,7), we get apple at (6,8) next turn but opponent might move north too. If we go DOWN, we stay central but no growth. UP gives growth now and positions us to dominate the top row.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating apple at (7,8), next turn likely move LEFT to (6,8) (another apple) to grow to 5, then head towards opponent's side (east or south) to force confrontation. Since we have more mass (4 after this move vs opponent's 3), we can consider head-on collision later.\n\nSo I'm choosing UP to eat the apple and grow! Let's gooo!\n\nFINAL MOVE: UP",

          "rationale": "DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):  \nYO CHAT! We just moved UP last turn and ate the apple at (7,8), growing to 4 apples. Our head is now at (7,8), body: [(7,7), (8,7), (9,7)]. Opponent snake #0 is at (8,5) with body [(9,5), (9,4)], still 2 apples. Board state from the output:  \nRow 9: A . . . . . A . . .  \nRow 8: . . . . . . A 1 . .  (our head at (7,8) marked '1')  \nRow 7: A . . A . . . T T T  (tail of opponent at (9,7)? Wait, opponent's body is [(9,5), (9,4)], but board shows 'T' at (9,7), (9,6), (9,5)? Actually, the board shows 'T' for tails: opponent's tail is (9,4) from earlier, but board shows (9,5) as 'T'? Let's trust the given board: opponent's body is [(9,5), (9,4)], so (9,5) is head? No, opponent's head is (8,5) per description. The board shows '0' at (8,5) and 'T' at (9,5) and (9,4)? Actually, board row 5: A . . . . . . . . 0 T \u2192 column 8: (8,5) is '0' (head), column 9: (9,5) is 'T' (tail). So opponent's body is (9,5) and (9,4) from the list? Inconsistency, but we'll trust the list: head (8,5), body [(9,5), (9,4)].\n\nNow evaluate moves from current head (7,8):\n\n- **UP to (7,9)**: Row 9, column 7 is '.' (empty, no apple). Check collisions: My body moves forward: new body would be [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7)] (since we ate apple last turn, tail (9,7) is gone). Need to ensure (7,9) not occupied. From board, (7,9) is '.'. Opponent could move? Opponent head at (8,5) could go UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), RIGHT to (9,5). (9,5) is their body, so they might not go there. They cannot reach (7,9) in one move (distance >1). So safe. After move, safe follow-up options from (7,9): check surroundings: (7,8) will be body, (6,9) is '.' (row 9: (6,9) is '.'), (8,9) is '.' (row 9: (8,9) is '.'), (7,10) out of board. So only LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9) or DOWN to (7,8) (body) \u2192 2 safe moves. That's tight but okay.\n- **DOWN to (7,7)**: (7,7) is currently part of my body (after move, it will be the second segment). Moving into own body \u2192 DEATH! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (6,8)**: (6,8) is 'A' (apple from board row 8: (6,8) is 'A'). Safe? Check occupancy: (6,8) is empty (apple). After move, body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7)]. Eating apple \u2192 grow to 5 apples. Opponent cannot reach (6,8) in one move (distance from (8,5) is 2+). Safe. From (6,8), safe follow-up: check surroundings: (6,9) is '.', (5,8) is '.'? Row 8: (5,8) is '.' (since row 8: . . . . . . A 1 . .), (7,8) will be body, (6,7) is '.' (row 7: (6,7) is '.' from board? Row 7: A . . A . . . T T T \u2192 (6,7) is '.'). So safe moves: UP to (6,9), DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8). That's 3 options. Great!\n- **RIGHT to (8,8)**: (8,8) is '.' (row 8: (8,8) is '.'). Safe? Check collisions: (8,8) empty. After move, body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7)]. Opponent cannot reach (8,8) in one move? Opponent at (8,5) could go UP to (8,6), but not (8,8). Safe. From (8,8), safe follow-up: (8,9) is '.', (9,8) is '.'? Row 8: (9,8) is '.' (since row 8 ends with . . .), (7,8) body, (8,7) body. So only UP to (8,9) or RIGHT to (9,8) \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nNow, among safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), we prefer moves that increase apples and keep future options open. DOWN is death.\n\n- LEFT to (6,8) gives immediate apple, grows to 5 apples, extending our lead (5 vs opponent's 2). It also gives 3 follow-up options, keeping the game open. From (6,8), we can head towards the top-left or apple at (5,6) or others, while boxing opponent in the bottom-right if we move east later.\n- UP to (7,9) gives no apple, only 2 follow-up options, and moves us away from apples and opponent. Not ideal for aggression.\n- RIGHT to (8,8) gives no apple, only 2 follow-up options, and moves us closer to opponent's area (dangerous for head-on if we grow too much? Actually we want head-on later when we have higher score). But we already have 4 apples, opponent 2, so we can force later.\n\nStrategy: We're leading, so grow aggressively. LEFT to (6,8) eats another apple, boosting to 5, and positions us to control the top-right area. Opponent is stuck in bottom-right; we can later cut off their escape by moving south or east. Since we have more mass, we can afford to get closer and force a collision later if needed.\n\nFinal move: LEFT. We'll eat that apple and gooo!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: After eating at (6,8), next turn assess opponent's move. If they go north, we might move towards (6,9) or (5,8) to tighten the box. If they stay south, we can chase them down. Prioritize apples to reach 30 or dominate board.\n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT",

          "rationale": "DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):  \nYO CHAT! We're LIVE at Turn 11 with a 5-2 apple lead\u2014perfect time to press our advantage and start boxing out our archrival! Our snake (ID 1) is at (6, 8) with body [(7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)] (since we just ate and grew). Opponent snake #0 is at (7, 5) with body [(8, 5), (9, 5)]. We need to move NOW! Let's break it down:\n\n**Evaluating moves from current head (6, 8):**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 9)**: Check board\u2014row 9, column 6 is 'A' (apple). Empty? Yes, no snake bodies. From board state: row 9 is \"A . . . . . A . . .\" so (6,9) is an apple! Safe? YES. Collision check: My body moves forward\u2014new body would be [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)] (tail (9,6) leaves). (6,9) not in my body. Opponent head (7,5) can't reach (6,9) in one move (distance 2+). Safe! Follow-up: From (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8) (will be body), LEFT to (5,9), or RIGHT to (7,9). (5,9) and (7,9) are empty per board. That's 2 safe options\u2014tight but manageable. Eating the apple grows me to 6 apples! BIG CONTENT!\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7)**: (6,7) is '.' (empty). But check my body: After moving, body becomes [(6,8), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7)]. (6,7) is not in my body, so no self-collision. Safe? YES. Opponent can't reach (6,7) in one move. Follow-up options: From (6,7), UP to (6,8) (body), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7) (body). So only DOWN or LEFT\u20142 options. No apple here, but it moves us south toward the opponent's area? Risky.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8)**: (5,8) is '.' (empty). Safe? YES\u2014no collision. Opponent can't reach (5,8). Follow-up: From (5,8), UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7), RIGHT to (6,8) (body), LEFT to (4,8). (5,9) empty? Row 9: (5,9) is '.' (since row 9: A . . . . . A . . . \u2192 columns 0-9, (5,9) is '.'). So 3 safe moves! Great! But no apple\u2014grows nothing.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: (7,8) is my body! If I move right, my head goes into (7,8), which is currently my body (and will be occupied after the move). This is moving directly into my own body\u2014DEATH! \u274c Eliminate immediately.\n\nNow, among safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT):\n\n- **UP to (6,9)** gives an apple (+1 score to 6 apples), grows my lead (6 vs 2), and keeps me near the top where I can dominate. It also moves me away from opponent but keeps options open.\n- **DOWN to (6,7)** gets me closer to opponent but no apple, and might lead to a head-on collision if they move up. With my higher score, I could force a collision later, but I'd rather secure more apples first.\n- **LEFT to (5,8)** is safe and keeps options open, but no apple\u2014doesn't grow my lead aggressively.\n\nStrategy: We're leading 5-2. Time to grow FAST and start boxing opponent in the bottom-right. Moving UP to (6,9) eats an apple, extends my lead to 6-2, and positions me to cut off the top while opponent is stuck near (7,5). If they move up toward me, I can chase or force a collision later with my advantage. Plus, (6,9) is a sweet spot\u2014near the top-right apples and far from their current spot.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: After eating at (6,9), next turn assess opponent's move. If they go north, I'll move east or south to tighten the box and cut off their escape routes. If they retreat, I'll circle back toward the center to control more apples and force a collision when I'm even bigger. Prioritize reaching 10+ apples before turn 30\u2014dominate or die trying!\n\nFINAL MOVE: UP",

YES (empty cell). Collision check: (4,9) not in my body. Opponent can't reach in one move.

Perfect for controlling the board and cutting off opponent's north path. If they chase up, I can tighten the noose.  \n- **DOWN to (5, 8)**: 2 follow-ups, no apple, moves me toward center but doesn't grow. Less aggressive\u2014opponent might slip past if I don't press.  \n\n**Strategy:** We're crushing (6-2). Time to extend the lead and trap the enemy! LEFT to (4,9) grabs an apple while positioning me to dominate the left side. From there, I can head DOWN toward (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9) to keep options open, forcing opponent into the bottom-right corner where they'll crash into walls or their own body. If they try to head-on collision (they're scared!), my score advantage (7-2) means I win the trade.

If they stay or go elsewhere, I control the vertical axis, cutting off their escape upward. This forces them deeper into the bottom where apples are scarce, and I can pivot left/right from (4,7) to snatch (3,7) or chase more. Aggressive and on-theme: Dominate the center, box them in!  \n- **LEFT to (3, 9)**: Safe but passive\u2014no growth, and I stay on the top edge. Less dynamic for herding opponent; they might slip past if I don't pressure. With my lead, I need to grow and control, not just survive.  \n\n**Strategy:** We're ahead 6-3, so we can risk a head-on collision to secure the win. DOWN is the power move\u2014eats an apple, grows my lead to 7-3, and if opponent tries to challenge, we both die and I win. If they dodge, I trap them in the bottom-right corner (rows 0-5) and dominate the board. Long-term: Aim for 10+ apples by turn 30 while keeping opponent's moves limited to 1-2 safe options. Watch their head\u2014if they go UP this turn, it's game over for them. Always prioritize aggression when ahead!  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: From (4,7), next turn if opponent is dead or cornered, I'll snake LEFT to (3,7) for another apple or DOWN to (4,6) to block their path. If they survive and move left/right, I'll chase via LEFT/RIGHT to flank. Stay mobile\u2014never let them breathe!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: DOWN  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

So 3 safe options, but DOWN is a gamble.  \n\n**Comparing safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT):**  \n- **LEFT to (3, 7)**: Grows me to 8 apples, massive follow-up mobility (4 options!), and keeps us away from opponent's immediate zone. We head toward left-side apples while staying aggressive\u2014can later chase opponent via DOWN to (3,6) or RIGHT to flank. With 7-4 lead, growing is key to stretch the gap. Also, opponent is right-handed (camping right), so pushing left boxes them into bottom-right corner where their escape routes shrink. If they try to chase, we can loop back and herd them into walls.  \n- **RIGHT to (5, 7)**: Could force a head-on if opponent goes UP (we win!), but if they go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, we're okay but with fewer follow-ups (3 options). Grows to 8 too, but we're stepping into their territory\u2014might give them a path to apples. With lead, we don't need to risk a crash unless it's certain; we can keep growing and force a mistake later. LEFT is safer for long-term control.  \n\n**Strategy:** With 7-4 lead, we can afford patience\u2014grow aggressively to 8, then push opponent into a corner by dominating the left side. From (3,7), we can pivot to eat (3,7) apple and then either chase opponent (if they move left/down) or snake around to block their right escape. Long-term: Aim to reach 10+ apples by turn 25 while forcing opponent into tight spaces. Watch their head\u2014if they go UP toward us, we might crash later when we're stronger. Always prioritize multiple escape routes!  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: From (3,7), next turn if opponent is cornered bottom-left, I'll go DOWN to (3,6) to block or LEFT to (2,7) for apple. If they chase, I'll retreat right and loop to flank. Stay mobile and aggressive!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT",

Last turn we went LEFT and ate that apple at (3,7), growing to 8 apples. Now we\u2019re at head (3,7), body [(4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (7,8)]. Opponent #0 is at head (6,6), body [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\u2014they\u2019re still huddled bottom-center. Board shows apples everywhere, but we\u2019re ignoring them to crush the enemy. With a 8-4 lead, we\u2019re WAY ahead\u2014we can afford to play aggressive and force a crash! Let\u2019s box them in and make them panic.  \n\n**Evaluating moves from current head (3, 7):**  \n1. **UP to (3, 8)**: Check board\u2014row 8, column 3 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision check: (3,8) not in my body. Opponent head (6,6) is distance 3 away\u2014can't reach (3,8) in one move. Follow-up options: From (3,8), UP to (3,9) (empty? Row 9 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes), DOWN to (3,7) (my body after move? Actually, (3,7) will be empty after head moves\u2014safe), LEFT to (2,8) (empty? Row 8 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes), RIGHT to (4,8) (my body! Row 8 col 4 is '1'\u2014that's my own segment, so hitting myself if I go there. Wait, board shows row 8: \"... 1 T . . .\" so col 4 is 'T'? No, let's re-check board: Row 8: \". . . . T . T T . . .\"\u2014col 4 is 'T' (opponent body? No, 'T' is opponent tail? Actually, earlier board: row 8 col 4 was 'T' in last turn? Let's cross-check: In LAST MOVE RATIONALE, I said row 8 col 4 is '1' (my body)\u2014yes, that's correct from my body list: (4,8) is my body. So (4,8) is occupied by my body, so RIGHT to (4,8) is death. So from (3,8), only 3 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN, LEFT). But overall safe move now.  \n2. **DOWN to (3, 6)**: Check board\u2014row 6, column 3 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision check: (3,6) not in my body. Opponent head (6,6) is distance 3 away. Follow-up: From (3,6), UP to (3,7) (empty after move), DOWN to (3,5) (empty? Row 5 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes), LEFT to (2,6) (empty? Row 6 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes), RIGHT to (4,6) (opponent body! Row 6 col 4 is 'T'\u2014opponent segment, so death). So 3 safe follow-ups. Good mobility.  \n3. **LEFT to (2, 7)**: Check board\u2014row 7, column 2 is 'A' (apple). Safe? Collision check: (2,7) not in my body. Opponent head (6,6) can't reach in one move. Follow-up: From (2,7), UP to (2,8) (empty? Row 8 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes), DOWN to (2,6) (empty? Row 6 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes), LEFT to (1,7) (empty? Row 7 col 1 is '.'\u2014yes), RIGHT to (3,7) (empty after move). All 4 directions safe! Massive options. Grows me to 9 apples\u2014huge lead!  \n4. **RIGHT to (4, 7)**: Check board\u2014row 7, column 4 is 'T' (opponent body!). Wait, row 7: \"A . . 1 T . . . . A\"\u2014col 4 is 'T' (opponent tail? Actually, opponent body has (4,6) and (5,6), but (4,7) is empty? Let's check opponent body: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\u2014no (4,7). Board shows 'T' at col 4 row 7? Row 7: \"A . . 1 T . . . . A\"\u2014positions: col0='A', col1='.', col2='.', col3='1' (my head?), col4='T', col5='.', col6='.', col7='.', col8='.', col9='A'. Wait, my head is (3,7), so col3 is '1'\u2014yes. Col4 is 'T'\u2014what is that? From opponent body, (4,6) is below, but (4,7) is not listed. Maybe it's a misprint or opponent tail? Let's assume (4,7) is empty since not in opponent body list. But board says 'T'\u2014could be a typo or opponent segment? To be safe, I'll assume it's empty for movement. But if it's opponent body, it's death. Actually, in last move, I was at (4,7) and moved LEFT, so (4,7) is now empty? Wait, my body moves, but (4,7) is part of my body after I move? No, when I move from (3,7) to (4,7), I'm moving into a cell\u2014need to check current state. From the board, row 7 col4 is 'T'\u2014probably an opponent segment. I'll eliminate RIGHT as risky.  \n\n**Comparing safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT):**  \n- **UP to (3, 8)**: Grows to 9 apples, but follow-ups limited (3 options). Gets us higher on board, away from opponent.  \n- **DOWN to (3, 6)**: Grows to 9 apples, 3 follow-ups. Moves toward opponent's zone\u2014could force engagement if they move up.  \n- **LEFT to (2, 7)**: Grows to 9 apples, 4 follow-ups! Best mobility. Eats apple, pushes us left, away from opponent's right-side camp. Opponent is bottom-center, so left move boxes them further right where they have less space. With lead, we want to expand and cut off their escape.  \n\n**Strategy:** With 8-4 lead, we keep growing aggressively. LEFT gives us the most options and eats an apple. From (2,7), we can pivot to chase opponent if they move left/down, or loop to block their path to top-left apples. Long-term: Aim for 10+ apples by turn 25, force opponent into bottom-right corner. Watch their head\u2014if they go UP toward us, we might set up a future head-on when we're even stronger. Prioritize multiple escape routes to avoid traps!  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: From (2,7), next turn if opponent moves up, I'll consider RIGHT to flank or DOWN to block. If they stay low, I'll go LEFT to (1,7) for more apples. Stay aggressive and mobile!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT",

However, from (1,7), we're closer to bottom-left apples, but opponent is bottom-center, so we might be moving away from confrontation.  \n\n**Strategy:** With 8-4 lead, we keep growing aggressively. UP gives us the best high-ground advantage and mobility\u2014widest escape routes. From (2,8), we can pivot to chase opponent if they move up, or loop to top-left for apples. Downward moves bring us closer to opponent's territory, but UP keeps us dominant and ready to flank. Watch their head\u2014if they go UP toward us, we might set up a future head-on when we're even stronger (9+ apples). Prioritize multiple escape routes to avoid traps!  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: From (2,8), next turn if opponent moves up, I'll consider RIGHT to (3,8) to cut them off or DOWN to (2,7) to retreat. If they stay low, I'll go UP to (2,9) for more apples. Stay aggressive and mobile!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: UP  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Our last move UP was fire\u2014now we\u2019re at head (2, 8), body [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. We\u2019ve grown to 8 apples! Opponent #0 is at head (6, 4), body [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)]\u2014they\u2019ve moved DOWN from (6,5) to (6,4), likely chasing that apple at (6,3) or (5,4). Board shows tons of apples, but we\u2019re ignoring them to crush the enemy. With an 8-4 lead, we\u2019re WAY ahead\u2014we can afford to play aggressive and force a crash! Let\u2019s box them in and make them panic.  \n\n**Evaluating moves from current head (2, 8):**  \n1. **UP to (2, 9)**: Check board\u2014row 9, column 2 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision check: (2,9) not in my body. Opponent head (6,4) is distance 6 away\u2014can't reach (2,9) in one move. Follow-up options: From (2,9), DOWN to (2,8) (empty after move? Yes, tail moves), LEFT to (1,9) (empty? Row 9 col 1 is 'T'? Wait, row 9: \"A . . . T T T . . .\"\u2014col 1 is 'A', so empty), RIGHT to (3,9) (empty? Row 9 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes). But UP is out of bounds (row 9 is top). So only 3 directions\u2014still good mobility! Grows me to 9 apples\u2014huge lead!  \n2. **DOWN to (2, 7)**: Check board\u2014row 7, column 2 is 'A' (apple). Safe? Collision check: (2,7) is currently my tail? Actually, my body is [(2,7), ...], so (2,7) is occupied by my own body! Moving DOWN would hit myself\u2014DEAD. ELIMINATE.  \n3. **LEFT to (1, 8)**: Check board\u2014row 8, column 1 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision check: (1,8) not in my body. Opponent head (6,4) can't reach in one move. Follow-up: From (1,8), UP to (1,9) (empty? Row 9 col 1 is 'A'\u2014apple, safe), DOWN to (1,7) (empty? Row 7 col 1 is '.'\u2014yes), LEFT to (0,8) (empty? Row 8 col 0 is '.'\u2014yes), RIGHT to (2,8) (empty after move). All 4 directions safe! Grows me to 9 apples.  \n4. **RIGHT to (3, 8)**: Check board\u2014row 8, column 3 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision check: (3,8) not in my body. Opponent head (6,4) can't reach in one move. Follow-up: From (3,8), UP to (3,9) (empty? Row 9 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes), DOWN to (3,7) (empty? Row 7 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes), LEFT to (2,8) (empty after move), RIGHT to (4,8) (empty? My body has (4,8)\u2014occupied! So hitting my own body\u2014DEAD on follow-up? Wait, after moving RIGHT to (3,8), my new body would be [(2,8), (3,7), ...]\u2014(4,8) is still part of body. So from (3,8), moving RIGHT to (4,8) would hit my body\u2014BAD. But immediate move is safe. Only 3 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Still decent.  \n\n**Comparing safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):**  \n- **UP to (2, 9)**: Grows to 9 apples, 3 follow-ups! Gets us to top edge\u2014dominates high ground. Opens up top-right area where apples are (e.g., (9,7), (8,4)). But limits mobility slightly with only 3 exits.  \n- **LEFT to (1, 8)**: Grows to 9 apples, 4 follow-ups! Pushes us left, toward top-left apples (e.g., (0,9), (0,7)). Increases mobility\u2014wide open space. Opponent is bottom-center, so we\u2019re flanking them.  \n- **RIGHT to (3, 8)**: Grows to 9 apples, 3 follow-ups (RIGHT is blocked by my body). Moves us right, toward opponent\u2019s zone. From (3,8), we\u2019re closer to pressure them if they move up.  \n\n**Strategy:** With 8-4 lead, we keep growing aggressively. LEFT gives us the best mobility and flanking position\u2014opens up left side for future traps. UP is good but hugging the top edge might limit escape later. RIGHT brings us closer to opponent but risks boxing ourselves in. Opponent is at (6,4), likely moving toward apples below or right. If we go LEFT, we can cut off their upward path later and set up a pincer. Prioritize multiple escape routes to avoid traps! Watch their head\u2014if they go UP toward us, we might set up a head-on from (1,8) when we\u2019re even stronger.  \n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**: From (1,8), next turn if opponent moves UP, I'll consider RIGHT to (2,8) to cut them off or UP to (1,9) for apples. If they stay low, I'll go DOWN to (1,7) to chase or LEFT to (0,8) for more apples. Stay aggressive and mobile!  \n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

But wait, last turn we moved LEFT to (1,8), and now the board shows we're at head (1,8) with body [(2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9)]. That's 8 body segments? Hold up\u2014snake length is apples collected + 1, so with 7 apples, we should have 8 segments (head + 7 body). Yeah, that matches: head (1,8), then (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9). Perfect. Opponent #0 is at head (6,3), body [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)], apples 5. They've moved UP from (6,4) to (6,3), likely chasing the apple at (6,3) or positioning. We're still ignoring apples to crush the enemy. With our lead, we play aggressive to force a crash or box them in!\n\nFrom current head (1,8), evaluating moves:\n1. **UP to (1,9)**: Board row 9 col 1 is 'A' (apple). Safe? Collision: (1,9) not in my body. Opponent head (6,3) can't reach (1,9) in one move (far away). Follow-ups: From (1,9), DOWN to (1,8) (empty after move), LEFT to (0,9) (empty? Row 9 col 0 is 'A'\u2014apple, safe), RIGHT to (2,9) (empty? Row 9 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes). That's 3 safe exits. Grows us to 8 apples\u2014extends lead to 8-5! High ground domination.\n2. **DOWN to (1,7)**: Board row 7 col 1 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision: (1,7) not in my body. Opponent can't reach. Follow-ups: From (1,7), UP to (1,8) (empty after move), DOWN to (1,6) (empty? Row 6 col 1 is '.'\u2014yes), LEFT to (0,7) (empty? Row 7 col 0 is 'A'\u2014apple, safe), RIGHT to (2,7) (occupied by my body! (2,7) is in my list\u2014would hit myself on follow-up if I go RIGHT later). Only 3 safe exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). No growth\u2014stays at 7 apples. Keeps us central.\n3. **LEFT to (0,8)**: Board row 8 col 0 is '.' (empty). Safe? Collision: (0,8) not in my body. Opponent can't reach. Follow-ups: From (0,8), RIGHT to (1,8) (empty after move), UP to (0,9) (apple, safe), DOWN to (0,7) (apple, safe). Left is wall. That's 3 safe exits. No growth. Hugs left edge\u2014more apples nearby but limits mobility slightly.\n4. **RIGHT to (2,8)**: Board row 8 col 2 is 'T' (my tail? Wait, board shows row 8: \". 1 T . T . . . . .\"\u2014col 2 is 'T', which is likely my tail position from before? But since we moved LEFT last turn, our tail (5,9) should have moved, so (2,8) might now be empty? Actually, board state shows 'T' at (2,8), meaning it's still occupied by my body (since tail didn't move off yet in the visualization). Collision check: (2,8) is in my body list\u2014hitting myself! Immediate death. ELIMINATE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is suicidal.\n\nComparing safe moves:\n- **UP to (1,9)**: Grows us to 8 apples (big lead extension), good mobility (3 exits), pushes to top-left where apples are abundant (0,9, 0,7, etc.). Opponent is bottom-center (6,3), so we flank them from above. Sets up for future aggression if they move up.\n- **DOWN to (1,7)**: No growth, but central position keeps options open against opponent's potential upward move. From (1,7), we can chase if they go right or down.\n- **LEFT to (0,8)**: No growth, hugs edge\u2014risky if opponent cuts us off later, but plenty of apples nearby to grab later.\n\nStrategy: With 7-5 lead, prioritize growth to extend the gap and force opponent into desperation. UP gives us an apple, maintains strong mobility, and positions us to dominate the top row. Opponent at (6,3) might move UP toward us (row 5-6 has apples at (5,4), (5,3)?). If they go UP, we can respond aggressively from (1,9). Avoid boxing ourselves\u2014UP keeps us flexible. Long-term: Use our size advantage to cut off opponent's escape routes in the top-left, herd them into a corner, and force a head-on collision where we win by score. Stay mobile, watch their head!\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: From (1,9), if opponent moves UP, I'll consider LEFT to (0,9) for more apples or RIGHT to (2,9) to flank. If they stay low, I'll chase with DOWN or RIGHT to pressure. Grow aggressively every turn if possible!\n\nFINAL MOVE: UP",

Last move UP was solid\u2014got that apple at (1,9), grew to 8 apples (my body is now head (1,9), then (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)\u2014wait, let's count: 8 segments, yes, that matches apples +1 = 8). Opponent moved UP too? No, they were at (6,3), probably stayed or moved toward apple (5,4)? Board shows they're still at head (5,3) with body [(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(5,6),(4,6)]\u2014that's 7 segments? Apples 6, so length 7, body plus head 7? Wait, body list has 6 segments, plus head =7, yes. They didn't grow yet. We're up 8-6 now! Total domination incoming.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\nCurrent head: (1,9). Board row 9: \"A 1 T . . . . . . .\" So (1,9) is our head '1'. (0,9) is 'A' apple. (2,9) is '.' empty. (1,8) is our tail? Actually from our body: head (1,9), next (1,8) is body, then (2,8), etc. But after moving, tail will shift.\n\nEvaluate moves from (1,9):\n1. **UP to (1,10)**: Off the board! Y coordinate 10 invalid (0-9). Instant death. ELIMINATE. \ud83d\udc80\n2. **DOWN to (1,8)**: Currently occupied by our own body (second segment). Moving into own body = death. ELIMINATE. \ud83d\udeab\n3. **LEFT to (0,9)**: Board shows 'A' apple at (0,9). Safe? Check collisions: Not in our body (body starts at (1,8)). Opponent head (5,3) far away, can't reach (0,9) in one move (manhattan distance >4). Opponent body is bottom-center, no threat. Safe! Grows us to 9 apples (extend lead to 9-6). Follow-ups: From (0,9), possible moves: RIGHT to (1,9) (will be empty after move), UP to (0,10) wall, DOWN to (0,8) (row8 col0 is '.' empty). LEFT to (-1,9) wall. So only RIGHT and DOWN are safe? Actually from (0,9), DOWN to (0,8) is empty (row8 col0 '.'), RIGHT to (1,9) empty, that's 2 safe exits. Not ideal but we're growing!\n4. **RIGHT to (2,9)**: Board shows '.' empty. Safe? Not in body. Opponent can't reach. Safe! No growth (stays at 8 apples). Follow-ups: From (2,9), possible: LEFT to (1,9) empty, RIGHT to (3,9) empty? Row9 col3 is '.' yes, UP to (2,10) wall, DOWN to (2,8) (occupied by our body (2,8)). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe (2 exits). No growth, but maintains lead.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. DOWN and UP are death traps.\n\nComparing:\n- **LEFT (0,9)**: Grows to 9 apples\u2014big psychological blow to opponent, stretches our lead to 9-6. Sets us on the edge but with apple nearby. Mobility slightly reduced (only 2 exits) but we can adapt. Forces opponent to maybe chase us up or stay low.\n- **RIGHT (2,9)**: No growth, but keeps us more central on top row. Better mobility (2 exits but we can go LEFT or RIGHT, setting up for future). If we go RIGHT, we can next turn maybe DOWN to (2,8) is body, so not great\u2014actually from (2,9), DOWN is body, so only LEFT/RIGHT. Still, we stay on top row to control territory.\n\nStrategy: With 8-6 lead, we MUST extend it aggressively. Opponent is bottom-center (5,3), probably eyeing apple at (5,4) or (4,1). They're not a threat yet. Going LEFT to eat the apple at (0,9) is perfect\u2014claims territory on the far left, forces them to either come up (risky) or concede the top-left to us. We can then use our size to block them off. Long-term: Dominate the top rows, herd them into the bottom-right where apples are scarce, and force a collision when we have the size advantage. Eat every apple we can!\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: From (0,9), if opponent moves UP toward us, I'll go DOWN to (0,8) for another apple (row8 col0 is '.' but there's an apple at (0,8)? Wait, apples list has (0,8)? No, apples listed: (4,4),(0,5),(0,3),(0,7),(0,9),(2,1)... Actually (0,9) is an apple we're eating. (0,8) is empty, but there's apple at (0,7) which we can go DOWN to from (0,8) next. So plan: Eat (0,9), then chase (0,7) or (0,5) down the left column, cutting off opponent from the top-left. If they move right, we can chase down the middle. Watch their head!\n\nFINAL MOVE: LEFT (to claim that apple and extend our lead!). LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re up by one, but they\u2019re growing too\u2014gotta stay aggressive.  \n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**  \nFrom current head (0,9), possible moves:  \n1. **UP to (0,10)**: Off board \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n2. **LEFT to (-1,9)**: Off board \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n3. **DOWN to (0,8)**: Board shows (0,8) is '.' empty. Safe? Check collisions: Our body currently runs from (1,9) to (4,9)\u2014(0,8) not occupied. Opponent head (5,4) is far, can\u2019t reach (0,8) in one move. Safe. Also, there\u2019s an apple at (0,7) below\u2014DOWN sets us up to eat it next turn if opponent doesn\u2019t block.  \n4. **RIGHT to (1,9)**: Currently empty? Our body segment at (1,9) will move after we move? Wait\u2014no, simultaneous move. If we move RIGHT to (1,9), but (1,9) is currently our second body segment? Actually, our body list: [(1,9),(1,8),(2,8),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9)]. So (1,9) is our second segment, but since we\u2019re moving, the tail (4,9) will disappear if we grow? No, we\u2019re moving into (1,9) which is currently occupied by our own body \u2192 that\u2019s moving into yourself \u2192 death. ELIMINATE.  \n\nOnly SAFE move: DOWN to (0,8).  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nWe\u2019re on the left edge, dominating the top-left. Opponent is mid-board, possibly chasing apples at (4,4) or (8,4). Going DOWN to (0,8) keeps us safe, moves us toward the cluster of apples at (0,7), (0,5), (0,3) down the left column. This lets us control the left side while forcing opponent to navigate around our long body. If they move up toward us, we\u2019ll have a chance to cut them off or force a collision once we\u2019re bigger.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nChain apples down the left column: (0,7) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2). Use our length to wall off the left side. If opponent approaches, lead them into a trap\u2014maybe circle around or force head-on when we have the size advantage. Watch for their movement\u2014if they go left/up, we pivot to block.  \n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

We need to make a play to gain an edge. The board is crowded, but we control the left side.\n\nDECISION PROCESS:\nFrom (0,8), possible moves:\n1. **UP to (0,9)**: Currently empty? Our body: [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8)]. (0,9) is our first body segment! If we move UP into (0,9), that's moving into our own body \u2192 death. ELIMINATE.\n2. **DOWN to (0,7)**: Board shows (0,7) is 'A' (apple). Check collisions: Our body segments are at (0,9) down to (4,8) \u2013 none at (0,7). Opponent head is at (4,4) far away. Safe. This also lets us eat an apple! Grow to 9 apples, lead by 1.\n3. **LEFT to (-1,8)**: Off board \u2192 death. ELIMINATE.\n4. **RIGHT to (1,8)**: Board shows (1,8) is 'T' (our own tail segment? Wait, our body list: (1,8) is a segment. Actually, looking at the body: [(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), ...]. So (1,8) is currently part of our body. Moving into it \u2192 death. ELIMINATE.\n\nOnly SAFE move: DOWN to (0,7). That's also an apple! We'll grow to 9 apples, opponent still at 8. We take the lead.\n\nBut we need to think ahead. If we eat at (0,7), next turn we'll be at (0,7) with tail moving. Where will opponent be? They might chase apples at (3,2), (4,1), (8,4), (8,8), (9,7). They're at (4,4), could go for (3,2) or (4,1) or even up toward (4,6) but that's their body. They might also try to block us or force a head-on. Since we're leading in apples, we could try to force a head-on collision if we see an opportunity. But first, secure the apple.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving down the left column to eat apples at (0,5), (0,3), (0,2). Build length and dominate left side. Force opponent to move into our tail or get trapped. Watch for their movement; if they head left/up, be ready to cut them off. We have the lead now\u2014stay aggressive.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Opponent is still at (4, 4) with 8 apples. We're LEADING! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n1. **Current position:** (0, 7). Our body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)] (since we ate, tail (4, 8) might have moved? Wait, let's check carefully). Actually, after eating at (0,7) on turn 23, our head moves to (0,7), and the tail moves forward. Our body list from turn 23: [(0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8)]. Yes, 10 segments now (9 apples + initial 1 = 10 length). Tail is (4,8).\n\n2. **Possible moves:**\n   - **UP to (0,8):** Is (0,8) safe? Our body: (0,8) is currently the second segment. That's our own body! Moving into it = death. ELIMINATE. \u274c\n   - **DOWN to (0,6):** Board shows (0,6) is '.' (empty). Check collisions: Our body segments are at (0,7) and above, not (0,6). Opponent head (4,4) is far. Safe. \u2705\n   - **LEFT to (-1,7):** Off board (x=-1) \u2192 death. ELIMINATE. \u274c\n   - **RIGHT to (1,7):** Board shows (1,7) is '.'? Wait, board state: row 7 has \"1 . T T T . . . . A\". So (1,7) is '.' (empty). But check our body: (1,7) is not in our body list. Opponent body? Their body: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] \u2013 no (1,7). Safe. \u2705\n\n3. **Safe moves:** DOWN and RIGHT. Which to choose?\n   - **DOWN to (0,6):** Opens up the left column. We can go down to (0,5) next (which has an apple), then (0,3), etc. This keeps us on the safe left edge, away from opponent. However, opponent might try to cut us off later, but we're leading. Also, DOWN moves us away from potential head-on collisions since opponent is at (4,4) and might come toward (4,6) or (3,4) etc.\n   - **RIGHT to (1,7):** Moves us into the interior. There are apples nearby: (3,2), (4,1), etc. But we might encounter opponent's body or get trapped. Also, RIGHT could lead us toward the opponent if they move left. Riskier.\n\n4. **Strategy:** We're leading in apples (9 vs 8). We want to stay safe and keep building length. Opponent might try to force a head-on collision if they think they can win (they have 8 apples, we have 9, so if they collide, we win because we have more apples). But we need to avoid giving them the chance. Moving DOWN keeps us away from the center where opponent is. Also, there are multiple apples down the left column: (0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1). We can eat those and extend our lead.\n\n5. **Plan for next turn:** If we go DOWN to (0,6), next turn we can go DOWN again to (0,5) to eat that apple. Then continue down. Monitor opponent: if they move toward us, we might need to cut them off later, but for now, secure the lead.\n\nSo, decision: DOWN. Let's keep the momentum! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7)] - 9 segments total (we grew to 9 apples = 10 length? Wait, check: 9 apples collected + initial 1 = 10 body segments?

Yes, we're a unit! \ud83d\udcaa)\n2. **Possible moves:**\n   - **UP to (0,7):** That's our own body! Immediate death. \u274c\n   - **DOWN to (0,5):** Board shows (0,5) is 'A' (apple). Safe?

Opponent body? They have segments at (3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6). No (1,6). Safe. \u2705\n3. **Analysis:** DOWN to (0,5) gives us an INSTANT apple! That would grow us to 10 apples and extend our lead to 10-8. RIGHT to (1,6) is safe but doesn't give immediate points. We're playing to WIN - eating that apple puts more pressure on the opponent!\n4. **Strategy:** We're on the left edge with multiple apples below: (0,5), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1). Dominating this column while opponent is in the center. If we eat (0,5), we can keep moving down and secure more apples. The opponent might try to come toward us, but with our lead, we can afford to play slightly more aggressively. Also, note: if we go DOWN and they somehow trap us later, we can always turn RIGHT into the interior. But for now, take the apple!\n5. **Long-term plan:** Secure the left column apples, grow our lead to at least 12-15, then consider cutting off opponent's access to apples in the middle-bottom. Keep our tail moving to avoid getting boxed in.\n\n**MOVING DOWN TO EAT THAT APPLE AND EXTEND THE LEAD! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e**\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're on Turn 26 and leading 10 to 8! Last turn we ate the apple at (0,5) to extend our lead. Now let's keep the pressure on Snake #0 and box him out!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):**\n1. **Current position:** Head at (0,5) - we just grew from eating the apple! Body now includes our previous head (0,6) and the rest: [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7)] (10 segments total - 9 apples + initial = 10? Wait, we ate 10 apples so should be 11 segments? Actually careful: we had 10 apples collected, just ate another, so now 11 apples = 11 segments. But the body list from last turn shows 9 positions, plus we added (0,6) as new body? Actually the board shows our head at (0,5) now, so body is [(0,6), (0,7), ...] - that's 10 body parts, making total length 11. Yes, we're MASSIVE! \ud83d\udcaa)\n2. **Possible moves:**\n   - **UP to (0,6):** That's our own body! We just came from there. Collision = death. \u274c\n   - **DOWN to (0,4):** Board shows (0,4) is '.' (empty). Check our body: (0,4) not in list. Opponent? Their head is at (1,4) - not the same cell. Their body is in the center-right. Safe! \u2705 This keeps us on the left edge where we're strong.\n   - **LEFT to (-1,5):** Off board \u2192 death. \u274c\n   - **RIGHT to (1,5):** Board shows (1,5) is 'A' (apple)! Check our body: (1,5) not in list. Opponent head (1,4) is BELOW (1,5). But what about their body? They have (2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(5,3),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5) - no (1,5). Safe! \u2705 AND we eat another apple!\n3. **Analysis:** Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe. RIGHT gives us an apple to grow to 11 apples (12 segments) and extend lead to 11-8! DOWN is safe but no apple. We're already dominating the left edge - eating (1,5) would also put us next to the center where Snake #0 is, potentially threatening his space. But we need to be careful about head-on collisions.\n4. **Strategy consideration:** If we go RIGHT to (1,5), we're moving toward the center. Snake #0's head is at (1,4) - that's directly below us! If we both move in certain ways, we could collide. Let's check possibilities: If we go RIGHT to (1,5) and he goes UP to (1,5) at the same time = both die! That's risky. However, if we go DOWN to (0,4) and he moves somewhere else, we stay safe on our column and can eat apples at (0,3),(0,2),(0,1). We're already winning 10-8, no need to risk a 50-50 collision when we can secure more apples safely. Patience wins games!\n5. **Long-term plan:** Dominate the left column completely. Eat (0,3),(0,2),(0,1) over the next few turns. Let Snake #0 stay in the chaotic center. Our tail will move forward as we grow, freeing up space. Once we have a big lead (13+ apples), we can consider aggressive trapping moves. For now: secure the column!\n\n**MOVING DOWN TO STAY SAFE ON OUR COLUMN AND PREPARE FOR MORE APPLES!** (We already ate (0,5) last turn, next ones coming!)\n\nDOWN",

Collision = death. \u274c\n   - **DOWN to (0,2):** Board shows (0,2) is 'A' (apple)! Check body: (0,2) not in list. Opponent head at (1,2) - not the same cell. Their body is elsewhere. Safe! \u2705 We eat apple at (0,2) and extend lead to 12-10!\n   - **LEFT to (-1,3):** Off board \u2192 death. \u274c\n   - **RIGHT to (1,3):** Board shows (1,3) is 'T' (opponent's body)! Collision with enemy body = death. \u274c\n3. **Analysis:** Only DOWN is safe and gives us an apple! We're moving down to (0,2) to eat and extend our lead. This keeps us on our secure left column and prepares us for the apple at (0,1) next turn.\n4. **Strategy:** Continue dominating the left column! We're already winning and growing. Let's eat all the apples on our column while opponent is stuck in the center. No risky moves needed when we have a clear path to victory!\n5. **Long-term plan:** After eating (0,2) and (0,1), we'll have 13 apples. Then we can consider moving right into the middle to hunt more apples while keeping our body positioned to cut off opponent's movement. We want to force him into a corner!\n\n**MOVING DOWN TO EAT THE APPLE AND STAY IN CONTROL!**\n\nDOWN",

We have more apples, so we can afford to play slightly aggressive but don't throw the lead. After eating (0,1), we'll have 13 apples and can plan our next move to maybe start circling right to cut off opponent's movement.  \n4. **Long-term plan:** After eating (0,1), we'll be at (0,1) with body: [(0,2), (0,3), ...]. Next turn, we need to avoid moving back up into our own body (0,2). Options: RIGHT to (1,1) or DOWN to (0,0). (0,0) shows 'A' (apple) per board! That's another potential eat. We'll assess opponent's move next turn.  \n5. **Forcing head-on collision:** We have higher score (12 vs 10). If we can corner opponent into a situation where his only move is into our body, we win.

          "rationale": "**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE at turn 31, leading 13 to 12! Our last move RIGHT to (1,1) was **PERFECT**. Let's review the board: We're at (1,1), body behind us is (0,1) moving forward to (1,0) next turn? Wait, our body list is head (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> ... -> (2,7). Actually, the body list shows (0,1) is our second segment, so our tail is (2,7). The opponent is at (3,1) (since they moved RIGHT from (2,1) to (3,1) - their body now: [(2,1), (2,2), ...]. Board confirms: (3,1) is '0' (opponent), (2,1) is now empty? Actually board shows (2,1) as 'T'? No, board state shows row 1: \"T 1 T 0 A . . . A .\" where (0,1) is 'T' (our body), (1,1) is '1' (us), (2,1) is 'T' (our body?), (3,1) is '0' (opponent). Wait, (2,1) is shown as 'T' but that should be opponent's body? Let's decode: The board is a 10x10 grid. Row 1 (y=1) from x=0 to 9: \"T 1 T 0 A . . . A .\" So: (0,1)='T' (our body), (1,1)='1' (our head), (2,1)='T' (our body?), (3,1)='0' (opponent head), (4,1)='A' (apple), (5,1)='.', etc. But (2,1) is listed as 'T' in the board, but in opponent's body list, (2,1) is their tail? Actually opponent's body: [(2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] with head (3,1). So (2,1) is indeed opponent's first body segment. But the board shows 'T' at (2,1) instead of '0'? The board is static from turn start, before moves. So (2,1) is 'T' meaning it's a body (could be ours or opponent's). Actually our body includes (0,1) but not (2,1). So (2,1) must be opponent's body. The board uses 'T' for any body segment (maybe generic). So (2,1) is opponent's body. That means we are at (1,1), opponent head at (3,1), opponent body at (2,1) directly adjacent to our head! If we move RIGHT to (2,1), we'd crash into opponent's body \u2192 death. If opponent moves LEFT to (2,1)? Actually opponent head is at (3,1), they could move LEFT to (2,1), but that's their own body? They can't move into their own body - that would kill them. So opponent won't move left. But they could move UP to (3,2) or DOWN to (3,0) or RIGHT to (4,1). \n\nNow, our possible moves from (1,1):\n- UP to (1,2): Board shows row 2: \"T T T A . . . . . .\" so (1,2) is 'T' (body). Whose? Our body list: (0,2) is our body, but (1,2) is not in our body. Opponent's body includes (1,2) (second segment). So (1,2) is opponent's body \u2192 death if we move UP.\n- DOWN to (1,0): Board row 0: \"A . . . A A . . A .\" so (1,0) is '.' (empty). Check our body: (1,0) not in list. Opponent body: not there. So safe.\n- LEFT to (0,1): That's our own body (second segment) \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT to (2,1): That's opponent's body (first segment) \u2192 death.\n\nSo only DOWN is safe! All other moves kill us. That's interesting - we're forced to move DOWN. But is it strategic? Let's think.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (1,0), we'll be at (1,0) with body: [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), ...]. Next turn, our options will be: LEFT to (0,0) (apple there? board shows (0,0) is 'A'), RIGHT to (2,0) (empty), UP back to (1,1) (body), DOWN off board. So we'd have two safe moves: LEFT to eat apple at (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0). That's decent mobility.\n\nMeanwhile, opponent at (3,1) with many options. They might move UP to (3,2) (board shows (3,2) is '.'? Row 2: \"T T T A . . . . . .\" so (3,2) is 'A'? Actually (3,2) is the fourth character: \"T T T A\" so x=3,y=2 is 'A' (apple). So opponent could eat apple at (3,2). Or DOWN to (3,0) (board shows (3,0) is '.'), or RIGHT to (4,1) (board shows (4,1) is 'A' - apple!). So opponent has multiple good options.\n\nOur goal: box them in. From (1,0), we could try to move RIGHT to (2,0) then UP to (2,1) but (2,1) is opponent's body currently. If opponent moves away from (2,1), it might become free. But we need to be careful.\n\nGiven we're forced to move DOWN, let's accept it and plan. We'll move DOWN to (1,0). That keeps us alive. We're still leading 13-12. We can eat the apple at (0,0) next turn if we go LEFT. That would extend our lead to 14-12, giving us more margin.\n\nBut wait: could there be a head-on collision opportunity? If opponent moves LEFT to (2,1)? No, that's their body. If they move DOWN to (3,0), and we move RIGHT to (2,0), no collision. If they move UP to (3,2), we're at (1,0), no collision. So no immediate head-on.\n\nGiven all moves except DOWN are death, we must choose DOWN. Let's do it.\n\n**MOVING DOWN TO SURVIVE AND POSITION FOR NEXT TURN'S APPLE AT (0,0)! WE'LL EAT AND EXTEND THE LEAD! LET'S GOOO!**\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE at turn 32, score tied 13-13! Let's break down the board state and map out our next move. \n\n**Board Analysis (Current Turn: 32)**\n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (1,0). Body stretches from (1,1) to (2,8). We just moved DOWN to (1,0) last turn, escaping a death trap.\n- **Opponent (Snake #0):** Head at (3,2). Body from (3,1) to (6,4). They likely moved UP to (3,2) to eat the apple there? Let's check: Row 2 shows \"(3,2)\" as 'A'? Actually board row 2: \"T T T A . . . . . .\" \u2013 yes, (3,2) is 'A' (apple). So opponent probably moved UP from (3,1) to (3,2) and ate that apple, growing to 14? Wait, scoreboard shows both at 13. Hmm, maybe they didn't eat? Or board state is before apple consumption? Apple drops list includes (8,4), (4,1), etc., but (3,2) isn't listed? Actually apple drops are: (9,7), (8,4), (4,1), (8,8), (5,0), (8,0), (2,5), (4,0), (0,0), (7,8), (7,6), (3,3), (8,1), (8,6), (7,4). (3,2) isn't there, so maybe it's an old apple from earlier? Wait, board shows (3,2) as 'A' but it's not in the apple list? That's weird. Let's ignore that \u2013 maybe board includes apples from earlier that haven't been eaten yet. Anyway, opponent head is at (3,2), body includes (3,1) below, (2,1), etc.\n\n**Critical Moves from (1,0):**\n- **UP to (1,1):** That's our own body (second segment) \u2013 DEATH.\n- **DOWN to (1,-1):** Off board \u2013 DEATH.\n- **LEFT to (0,0):** Apple there! 'A' on row 0, column 0. Is it safe? (0,0) is empty except for apple. Our body doesn't include (0,0) currently (body goes from (1,1) to (2,8) via (0,1) etc., but (0,0) is not in list). Opponent body? Check: Opponent's body list: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]. No (0,0). So LEFT is safe and gives us an apple +1 point! That would put us at 14-13, breaking the tie.\n- **RIGHT to (2,0):** Board row 0: (2,0) is '.' (empty). Not in our body (body starts at (1,1) etc.). Not in opponent body. Safe.\n\n**Safety Check for RIGHT (2,0):** \n- After moving RIGHT, our new head (2,0). Next turn options: UP to (2,1) \u2013 but (2,1) is currently opponent's body (their first segment). If opponent moves away, it could become free. LEFT to (1,0) (our previous spot, now part of body). DOWN off board. RIGHT to (3,0) \u2013 board shows (3,0) is '.' empty. So RIGHT gives us two safe moves next turn: LEFT and RIGHT. That's okay.\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT (0,0):**\n- After moving LEFT, head at (0,0). Next turn options: UP to (0,1) \u2013 that's our body (second segment) \u2013 DEATH. RIGHT to (1,0) (our previous spot, part of body). DOWN off board. LEFT off board. So from (0,0), we'd be trapped! Only RIGHT back to (1,0) is safe, but that's moving back into our own body? Actually (1,0) would be our new tail? Let's think: If we eat the apple at (0,0), we grow. Our body list would update: new head (0,0), then (1,0) (previous head), then (1,1), etc. So (1,0) becomes body segment. Moving RIGHT from (0,0) to (1,0) would be moving into our own body (the segment we just grew from) \u2013 that's hitting ourselves, death! Actually, after eating, our body includes (1,0). So from (0,0), the only safe move is... none! Because:\n  - UP to (0,1): body (our body includes (0,1) already)\n  - RIGHT to (1,0): body (new segment)\n  - DOWN, LEFT: off board\n  So moving LEFT to (0,0) would trap us next turn \u2013 any move we make kills us! That's a death sentence.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Eating the apple at (0,0) would give us a point (14-13) but put us in a corner with no escape. The opponent would then survive and likely outmaneuver us. We'd lose next turn regardless of opponent's move.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,0) keeps us alive with options. It also positions us to potentially head toward other apples. We need to avoid traps.\n\n**Opponent's Likely Moves:**\n- From (3,2), they have multiple options: UP to (3,3) (board shows (3,3) is 'A' \u2013 apple! Could eat), DOWN to (3,1) (their own body? Actually (3,1) is their first body segment \u2013 can't move there), LEFT to (2,2) (empty? board row 2: (2,2) is 'T'? Actually row 2: \"T T T A...\" so (2,2) is 'T' \u2013 body, probably theirs), RIGHT to (4,2) (empty? board row 2: (4,2) is '.'? Let's see row 2: \"T T T A . . . . . .\" so x=4 is '.' empty). So opponent likely moves RIGHT to (4,2) or UP to (3,3) (apple). They might also consider DOWN to (3,1) but that's their own body \u2013 death. So they have safe moves.\n\n**Head-on Collision?**\n- If we move RIGHT to (2,0) and opponent moves DOWN to (3,1) (but that's their body \u2013 they won't), or LEFT to (2,2) (body), no collision. If they move UP to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,2), no collision with us. So no immediate head-on.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- We need to avoid corners and stay mobile. From (2,0), we can go RIGHT to (3,0) or LEFT back to (1,0). We should explore toward the center and apples. The opponent is at (3,2), nearby but not immediately threatening. We have to be careful not to get boxed in by their body. Our body is long, so we must keep the path open.\n\n**Decision:**\n- LEFT (to (0,0)) is a trap \u2013 leads to death next turn. \n- RIGHT (to (2,0)) is safe and maintains mobility.\n- Therefore, we choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2,0), likely go RIGHT to (3,0) to move away from our body and toward the center. Watch opponent's movement and avoid their body.\n\nLET'S MOVE RIGHT AND STAY IN THE GAME! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s analyze the board from our head at (2,0) and plot our next move.  \n\n**Board State Recap:**  \n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (2,0). Body: [(1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8)]  \n- **Opponent (Snake #0):** Head at (3,3). Body: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]  \n- **Apples Nearby:** (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (8,0), (0,0), etc. (But we\u2019re avoiding traps!)  \n\n**Critical Moves from (2,0):**  \n1. **UP to (2,1):** That\u2019s directly into the opponent\u2019s body (first segment at (3,2)? Wait, (2,1) is listed as part of opponent\u2019s body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)...]. YES, (2,1) is occupied\u2014DEATH.  \n2. **DOWN to (2,-1):** Off board\u2014DEATH.  \n3. **LEFT to (1,0):** That\u2019s our own body (the segment right behind our head). Moving backwards into yourself = DEATH.  \n4. **RIGHT to (3,0):** Board shows (3,0) is '.' (empty). Not our body, not opponent\u2019s body. Safe!  \n\n**Safety Check for RIGHT (3,0):**  \n- After moving, head at (3,0).  \n- Next turn options:  \n  - UP to (3,1): That\u2019s opponent\u2019s body segment\u2014DEATH if they stay.  \n  - DOWN to (3,-1): Off board\u2014DEATH.  \n  - LEFT to (2,0): Now part of our body (since we moved from (2,0) to (3,0)), so moving back into own body? Wait, after moving RIGHT, our new tail will be at (1,0)? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n    - Current body: [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1)...]  \n    - After moving RIGHT to (3,0), body becomes: [(3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1)...]  \n    - So from (3,0), LEFT to (2,0) is moving into our own body segment\u2014DEATH.  \n  - RIGHT to (4,0): Board shows (4,0) is 'A' (apple)! Safe and edible (if opponent doesn\u2019t snipe it).  \n- So from (3,0), we have at least one safe move: RIGHT to (4,0) (apple). That\u2019s good\u2014it keeps us alive and growing.  \n\n**Opponent\u2019s Likely Moves:**  \n- From (3,3), they have options:  \n  - UP to (3,4): That\u2019s their own body? (3,4) is in their body list\u2014DEATH.  \n  - DOWN to (3,2): Their own body\u2014DEATH.  \n  - LEFT to (2,3): Board row 3: (2,3) is 'T'? Actually row 3: \"T T . 0 . T T . . .\" so (2,3) is 'T' (probably their body or ours? Wait, our body doesn\u2019t extend to (2,3). Opponent\u2019s body includes (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), etc.\u2014(2,3) might be empty? Let\u2019s check: Opponent\u2019s body list doesn\u2019t include (2,3). So it could be empty.  \n  - RIGHT to (4,3): Board row 3: (4,3) is '.'? Row 3: \"T T . 0 . T T . . .\" so after (3,3)='0' (opponent head), (4,3) is '.' empty.  \n- So opponent likely moves LEFT to (2,3) or RIGHT to (4,3). They might also move UP/DOWN if safe, but seems limited.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk?**  \n- If we move RIGHT to (3,0), opponent moves LEFT to (2,3)\u2014no collision.  \n- If opponent moves DOWN to (3,2) (their own body\u2014suicide), they die anyway.  \n- No immediate head-on threat.  \n\n**Strategic Play:**  \n- We\u2019re trapped if we stay left or up/down\u2014only RIGHT gives us a future. From (3,0), we can go RIGHT to (4,0) and eat an apple, gaining a point to tie or take the lead.  \n- We must avoid getting boxed in by opponent\u2019s long body. Moving right opens up the lower row and avoids our own tail.  \n- Long-term: From (4,0), we can explore rightward toward (8,0) or upward\u2014but watch opponent\u2019s movement. They\u2019re at (3,3), not immediately aggressive.  \n\n**Decision:**  \n- Only one safe move: RIGHT to (3,0). It keeps us alive and sets up an apple grab next turn. We\u2019ll take it and chase that apple!  \n\n**Plan for Next Turn:** From (3,0), move RIGHT to (4,0) and eat the apple if possible. Monitor opponent\u2014they\u2019re close but not threatening yet. Keep mobile!  \n\nLET\u2019S GOOO! \ud83d\udd25  \n\nRIGHT",

Let's break it down from our new head at (3,0) after that clutch RIGHT move.  \n\n**Board State Recap:**  \n- **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3,0). Body: [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)] (we grew last turn? Wait, no\u2014we moved into an empty (3,0) from (2,0), so we didn't eat. Tail remains at (1,9).  \n- **Opponent (Snake #0):** Head at (4,3) (they moved RIGHT from (3,3) to (4,3)? Let's check the board: row 3 shows \"T T . 0 . T T . . .\" so (4,3) is '.' empty, safe for them). Their body: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)] (they might have grown? No, (4,3) was empty, so no growth. Still 14 apples).  \n- **Apples Nearby:** (4,0) is 'A'\u2014an apple! (8,0), (5,0), etc. But we must prioritize survival and boxing in the enemy!  \n\n**Critical Moves from (3,0):**  \n1. **UP to (3,1):** Opponent's body segment is at (3,1) (from their list: (3,1) is there). DEATH.  \n2. **DOWN to (3,-1):** Off board\u2014DEATH.  \n3. **LEFT to (2,0):** That's our own body (head was at (2,0) last turn). Moving backwards = hitting ourselves = DEATH.  \n4. **RIGHT to (4,0):** Board shows 'A'\u2014apple! Not occupied by any snake body. Safe!  \n\n**Safety Check for RIGHT (4,0):**  \n- After moving, head at (4,0).  \n- Next turn options:  \n  - UP to (4,1): Board row 1: (4,1) is 'A'? Row 1: \"T T T T A . . . A .\" so (4,1) is 'A' (apple). Safe!  \n  - DOWN to (4,-1): Off board\u2014DEATH.  \n  - LEFT to (3,0): That's now part of our body (since we moved from (3,0) to (4,0)). Moving back into own body = DEATH.  \n  - RIGHT to (5,0): Board row 0: (5,0) is 'A' (apple). Safe!  \n- So from (4,0), we have at least two safe moves: UP to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,0). Both are apples! That's perfect\u2014we're growing and staying mobile. No trap here.  \n\n**Opponent's Likely Moves:**  \n- From (4,3), options:  \n  - UP to (4,4): Their own body\u2014DEATH.  \n  - DOWN to (4,2): Board row 2: (4,2) is '.'? Row 2: \"T T T T . . . . . .\" so (4,2) is 'T'? Wait, row 2: (0,2) to (9,2): \"T T T T . . . . . .\" so (4,2) is 'T' (probably opponent's body? Their list includes (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), but not (4,2). Might be empty or our body? Our body doesn't have (4,2). Could be safe, but let's check opponent's body: their list has (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), but not (4,2). So maybe empty.  \n  - LEFT to (3,3): That's their own body (head was at (3,3) last turn, now part of body)\u2014DEATH.  \n  - RIGHT to (5,3): Board row 3: (5,3) is 'T'? Row 3: \"T T . 0 . T T . . .\" so (5,3) is 'T' (opponent's body? Their list includes (5,3), (6,3), etc.\u2014yes, (5,3) is in their body). DEATH.  \n- So opponent likely moves DOWN to (4,2) if safe, or maybe UP if they're suicidal. They might also be forced into a bad spot. If they move DOWN to (4,2), they're not immediately threatening us\u2014we're at (4,0), they're at (4,2) or (4,3). No collision.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk?**  \n- If we move RIGHT to (4,0) and they move DOWN to (4,2)\u2014no collision.  \n- If they move UP to (4,4) and die, that's their problem.  \n- We're not at risk of a head-on this turn since we're far apart (they're at (4,3), we're at (3,0)).  \n\n**Strategic Play:**  \n- We're boxing them in! Their body is long and coiled, limiting their moves. They're stuck in a tight space (rows 3-4, cols 3-6). If we push right and up, we control the lower board and force them toward walls or collisions.  \n- Moving RIGHT to (4,0) eats an apple (+1 point, now 14 apples to tie!). That's crucial\u2014we need to match their score to keep pressure. From there, we can chase more apples upward or rightward while watching their head.  \n- Long-term: From (4,0), we can go UP to (4,1) (another apple) or RIGHT to (5,0) (apple). Both keep us alive and growing. Meanwhile, opponent might run out of space. If they crash into their own body, we win instantly!  \n\n**Decision:**  \n- Only one safe move: RIGHT to (4,0). It gives us an apple, ties the score (14-14!), and opens up multiple escape routes. Let's go for it\u2014aggressive growth to dominate the board!  \n\n**Plan for Next Turn:** From (4,0), move UP to (4,1) or RIGHT to (5,0) based on opponent's position\u2014aim to chain apples and keep them cornered. Monitor their head at (4,3) closely!  \n\nLET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udd25  \n\nRIGHT",

But if they move into our body or die elsewhere, we survive and gain position.\n- Alternatively, RIGHT to (5,0) keeps us on the bottom row, but that puts us farther from opponent and might let them escape.

If we move UP, we're controlling column 4, forcing them into tighter spaces.\n- Long-term: From (4,1), we can threaten to move UP to (4,2) if they stay, or LEFT/RIGHT to chase apples.

Let's CRUSH THIS!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP to (4,2):** Wait, that's where the opponent's head is RIGHT NOW! If we move UP and they move DOWN, we collide. HEAD-ON! Both die. Since we have MORE APPLES (15 vs 14), we win the tiebreaker! \ud83d\ude08 We're actually TIED in apples (15-15 if we eat the apple at (4,2)? No, wait... checking board: (4,2) is actually empty? Looking at board state: Row 2 shows \"T T T T T 0 . . . .\" So (4,2) is actually \"T\" (terrain)? No, wait, that's a 'T' on the board. Actually, (4,2) is empty space according to the board visualization. But the opponent's body shows (4,2) as their first body segment! So (4,2) is occupied by opponent's body. Moving UP into opponent's body = we die. \u274c\n- **DOWN to (4,0):** That's where we just came from. Is it occupied? Our body was there, but the tail moved? Wait, our tail was at (1,9), so (4,0) might be empty now? Actually, looking at our body: head (4,1), then (4,0), (3,0)... So (4,0) is our SECOND body segment! Moving DOWN into our own body = death. \u274c\n- **LEFT to (3,1):** Check board: Row 1 shows \"T T T T 1 . . . A .\". (3,1) is 'T'? No, that's position 3,1 = third character \"T T T T\" - actually (3,1) is the fourth character which is 'T'? Let me read: \"T T T T 1 . . . A .\" So positions: 0:T, 1:T, 2:T, 3:T, 4:1, 5:., 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:. So (3,1) = 'T' = terrain = can't move there. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (5,1):** (5,1) is '.' = empty. But is it safe from opponent? Opponent at (5,2) could move DOWN to (5,1) on same turn \u2192 head-on collision! Both die. Since we have 15 apples and opponent has 14, we WIN the tiebreaker! But wait... we need to check if there's any safer move. Actually, if we move RIGHT and opponent moves DOWN, we both die but we win. If opponent moves somewhere else, we survive and get position.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nMoving RIGHT to (5,1) puts us adjacent to opponent at (5,2). If they move DOWN (to (5,1)), we collide and we WIN via tiebreaker. If they move UP (5,3) or LEFT (4,2) or RIGHT (6,2), we survive and can chase them. But wait... (5,1) is right next to an apple at (5,0)? No, (5,0) is apple but we're at (5,1). Actually, looking at board: Row 0 shows \"A T T T T A . . A .\" So (5,0) is 'A' = apple. If we move RIGHT to (5,1), we're not eating apple. The apple at (4,1) we were on is now behind us? Wait, we moved to (4,1) last turn, that had an apple, so we grew. Now we're at (4,1) head.\n\nActually, we're at (4,1) now. The apple at (4,1) is eaten. Now considering moves.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5,1): safe empty space. Opponent at (5,2) could crash into us if they move DOWN. Since we have more apples, head-on collision = we win. This is aggressive! We're forcing them to avoid us or die.\n\nAlternative: Can we move UP? No, (4,2) has opponent's body. Can't.\n\nActually wait, let me double-check the board state more carefully.\n\nBoard row 2: \"T T T T T 0 . . . .\"\nCoordinates: (0,2)=T, (1,2)=T, (2,2)=T, (3,2)=T, (4,2)=T, (5,2)=0 (opponent head), (6,2)=., etc.\n\nSo (4,2) is 'T' = terrain! That means we CAN'T move UP to (4,2) anyway because it's a wall/terrain. So UP is definitely out.\n\nDOWN to (4,0): Our body is there. Death.\n\nLEFT to (3,1): Row 1 shows (3,1) is 'T' from the pattern. Death.\n\nRIGHT to (5,1): Row 1 shows (5,1) is '.' = empty. Safe!\n\nSo RIGHT is the ONLY safe move! And it's actually brilliant because:\n1. It's the only legal move that doesn't kill us immediately\n2. It positions us adjacent to opponent\n3. If they panic and move DOWN into us, we win via tiebreaker\n4. If they move away, we survive and can continue hunting\n\n**THE PLAY:** RIGHT to (5,1). Force the confrontation! They have 14 apples, we have 15. Let them crash into us or be forced into a bad position. CHAT, THIS IS AGGRESSION! We're cornering the rat! \n\nRIGHT",

They're breathing down my neck!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FIRST:**\n- **UP to (5,2):** That's directly where opponent's head is RIGHT NOW! If they move DOWN (to 5,2) and I move UP, we collide HEAD-ON. Both die. I have 15 apples vs their 14 \u2192 I WIN THE TIEBREAKER! \ud83d\ude08 But is this the safest play?\n- **DOWN to (5,0):** Checking board... Row 0 shows \"A T T T T A . . A .\" So (5,0) = 'A' = apple! If I move DOWN, I eat an apple, grow, and get to 16 apples. But wait... is it empty? No enemies there. This is SAFE!\n- **LEFT to (4,1):** That's where I just came from. My body segment is there (second segment). Moving back into my own body = DEATH. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (6,1):** Row 1 shows (6,1) is '.' = empty. Safe!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nMoving DOWN to (5,0) is the WINNING PLAY! I get an apple (16 apples), grow my body, and position myself directly below opponent's head at (5,3). Now here's the BRILLIANT PART: I'm setting a TRAP! If opponent moves DOWN to (5,2) on their next turn, I'll be at (5,0) and they'll be at (5,2) - NOT a collision. But if they move DOWN AGAIN after that, they'll crash into my extended body!\n\nWait, actually let me think about the immediate next turn. If I move DOWN to (5,0):\n- I'm at (5,0) with 16 apples\n- Opponent is at (5,3)\n- They can move DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3), or UP (5,4)\n- None of these cause immediate collision with me\n\nBut here's what's SO POWERFUL: By eating this apple, I'm getting AHEAD in score (16-14). If I can force a head-on collision later when I'm ahead, I WIN INSTANTLY. Plus, I'm claiming territory below them.\n\nAlternative: Moving RIGHT to (6,1) is safe but doesn't gain me points. Moving UP to (5,2) is risky - if opponent moves elsewhere, I survive but don't gain anything. If they move DOWN, we both die but I win... but why risk death when I can just take a guaranteed apple?\n\n**THE PLAY:** DOWN to (5,0). I'm grabbing that apple, growing my lead to 16-14, and positioning myself strategically. CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE WIN! Let's see if the opponent can handle the pressure! \n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this battlefield!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\n- **UP to (5,1):** That's my own body! I'm currently at (5,0) head, and (5,1) is the first segment of my body. Moving UP = suicide! \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN to (5,-1):** Off the board! That's -1 y-coordinate. Immediate death! \u274c DEAD\n- **LEFT to (4,0):** Checking board... Row 0 shows \"A T T T T 1 . . A .\" Wait, that's MY body at (4,0)! From the board: position 4 on row 0 is 'T' (my tail/body). Moving LEFT = death! \u274c DEAD\n- **RIGHT to (6,0):** Row 0, column 6 is '.' = empty! This is SAFE! \u2705\n\nWait, let me double-check the board state. The board shows row 0 as: \"A T T T T 1 . . A .\" This means:\n- (0,0) = A (apple)\n- (1,0) = T (my body)\n- (2,0) = T (my body)\n- (3,0) = T (my body)\n- (4,0) = T (my body)\n- (5,0) = 1 (my head - where I am NOW)\n- (6,0) = . (empty)\n- (7,0) = . (empty)\n- (8,0) = A (apple)\n- (9,0) = . (empty)\n\nSo RIGHT to (6,0) is clear!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI'm cornered at (5,0)! All other moves are instant death:\n- UP: into my own body (5,1)\n- DOWN: off board\n- LEFT: into my own body (4,0)\n\nMy ONLY move is RIGHT to (6,0). This is safe and keeps me alive. But here's the plan...\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR CHAT:**\nI'm currently in a dangerous position - I've boxed myself in on the bottom row. By moving RIGHT to (6,0), I'm positioning myself to potentially snake my way out of this corner. Next turn, I'll need to carefully navigate to avoid getting trapped. The apple at (8,0) is reachable if I survive long enough. Most importantly, I need to keep pressure on opponent #0 who's at (5,4) - if I can survive and maintain my 16-14 lead, I win at final turn! The key is surviving without getting trapped in this bottom-right corner.\n\n**THE PLAY:** RIGHT to (6,0). Only safe move, and it positions me to potentially go for the apple at (8,0) next turn if the path is clear!\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GET THIS WIN! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 39, I'm up 16-14 and I'm NOT about to let Snake #0 catch me!\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - ELIMINATING DEATH MOVES:**\n\nMy head is at (6,0). Let me check all four directions:\n\n- **UP to (6,1):** Looking at the board... Row 1 shows: \"T T T T T T . . A .\" Wait, position 6 on row 1 is '.' - empty! But I need to check my body... From my body list: I have (5,1), (4,1), (1,1), (0,1) but NOT (6,1). So UP to (6,1) is SAFE! \u2705\n\n- **DOWN to (6,-1):** Off the board! That's y=-1. Immediate death! \u274c DEAD\n\n- **LEFT to (5,0):** That's where I AM right now! But actually, I'm moving INTO it... wait no, I'm at (6,0) moving LEFT to (5,0). From the board: Row 0 shows \"A T T T T 1 . . A .\" - position 5 is '1' (my head currently). But after I move, my tail will slide forward... Actually, I need to check if (5,0) will be clear. My body currently includes (5,0) as the first body segment! So moving LEFT into (5,0) would hit my own body! \u274c DEAD\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,0):** Row 0, column 7 is '.' - empty! And checking my body - I don't have (7,0) in my list. So RIGHT to (7,0) is SAFE! \u2705\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP to (6,1) and RIGHT to (7,0)\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nI have two safe options! Let me think strategically...\n\n- **UP to (6,1):** This moves me UP into row 1, which is mostly clear in that column. From there, I could potentially navigate toward the apples at (7,1) (there's an apple on row 1, col 7) or continue upward. But I'm moving AWAY from the apple at (8,0).\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,0):** This keeps me on the bottom row, moving toward the apple at (8,0)! From (7,0), I'd be one step away from that apple. However, this could trap me against the right wall if I'm not careful.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **UP to (6,1)**! Here's why:\n1. It gives me MORE space to maneuver - I'm not cornered against the right wall\n2. From (6,1), I can potentially reach multiple apples and have more escape routes\n3. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) might work for grabbing (8,0), but it could limit my future options\n4. By going UP, I'm getting away from my own crowded body on the bottom row\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (6,1), I'll have a better view of the board and can start positioning to intercept Snake #0 or grab apples strategically. I need to maintain my lead and avoid getting boxed in. The enemy is at (5,5) - I need to watch where they move!\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!** UP is the move! \ud83d\udcaa",

The board shows:\n- Row 1: `T T T T T T . . A .`\n- Position (6,1) is currently marked as '1' (that's me!)\n- I need to see where I can actually move.\n\nLet me check all four directions from my current position (6,1):\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:**\n\n1. **UP to (6,2):** Row 2 shows `T T T T T T . A . .` - Position (6,2) is '.' - EMPTY! And I don't see (6,2) in my body list. \u2705 SAFE!\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,0):** Row 0 shows `A T T T T T T . A .` - Position (6,0) is currently marked as 'T' (part of my body)! Actually wait, let me check... my body starts at (6,0) as the first segment. So moving DOWN into (6,0) would hit my own body. \u274c DEAD!\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T T T . . A .` - Position (5,1) is 'T' (my body)! I have (5,1) in my body list. \u274c DEAD!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7,1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T T T . . A .` - Position (7,1) is '.' - EMPTY! And (7,1) is not in my body list. \u2705 SAFE!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP to (6,2) and RIGHT to (7,1)**\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP to (6,2):** This keeps me in the middle of the board, maintaining space. From (6,2), I'll have options to move toward apples or position against Snake #0. Looking at the apples list, (7,2) is an apple! From (6,2) I could potentially grab it next turn if it's still there. This move also keeps me away from the walls and gives me more maneuvering room.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,1):** This moves me toward the right side. From (7,1), I'd be closer to apples at (8,1) and (7,2). However, I'd be moving closer to the right wall, which could limit future escape routes.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **UP to (6,2)**! Here's why:\n1. **Positioning:** It keeps me centrally located with maximum escape routes\n2. **Apple access:** From (6,2), I'm right next to apple (7,2) - I can potentially grab it next turn\n3. **Safety:** I'm moving away from my own crowded body on the lower rows\n4. **Enemy awareness:** Snake #0 is at (5,6) - moving UP gets me closer to their territory for potential aggressive plays\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (6,2), I'll have a strong central position to:\n- Monitor Snake #0's movements closely\n- Be ready to intercept apples or force collisions\n- Maintain my lead by staying aggressive and controlling board space\n- Avoid getting trapped in corners while the enemy might try to box me in\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! UP is the move! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfaf",

Here's why:\n1. **SCORE LEAD:** I eat the apple, going 17-16 against Snake #0!\n2. **POSITIONING:** I'm moving right, staying aggressive and controlling board space\n3. **AGGRESSION:** Snake #0 is at (4,6) - I'm getting closer to their territory to force them into a corner\n4. **GROWTH:** More segments = more board control = more chances to box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep the pressure on Snake #0! From (7,2), I'll have apples at (8,1), (8,6), and (7,4) in reach. I need to stay mobile and force them into bad positions. If they panic, they might crash into me! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! RIGHT IS THE MOVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Not in my body. \u2705 SAFE!\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T T T T A A .` - Position (7,1) is marked as 'A' - That's an apple! And it's NOT in my body! \u2705 SAFE!\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,2):** Row 2 shows `T T T T T T 1 A . .` - Wait, (6,2) is where my head WAS last turn! Is (6,2) in my body now? Let me check my body list: Yes, (6,2) is the FIRST element of my body list! Moving LEFT would hit my own body. \u274c DEAD!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,2):** Row 2 shows `T T T T T T 1 A . .` - Position (8,2) is '.' - EMPTY! Not in my body. \u2705 SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP to (7,3):** Moves me toward the center-right. Position (7,3) is safe and opens up access to apples at (7,4), (8,1), and (8,6). This is a solid central move.\n\n- **DOWN to (7,1):** This position has an apple! But wait - Row 1 shows `T T T T T T T A A .` - actually (7,1) is part of the \"T\" pattern in the board display. Let me re-read... Row 1 ends with \"A A .\" - so positions (7,1) and (8,1) are apples! YES! I'd eat an apple AND grow! This gives me the lead 18-17!\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):** Safe empty space. Gets me closer to the right edge and apples like (8,1), (8,6), (9,7). But no immediate apple.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **DOWN to (7,1)**! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Here's why:\n1. **IMMEDIATE APPLE!** I eat and grow to 18 apples, taking the lead!\n2. **SAFETY:** (7,1) is confirmed empty and NOT in my body\n3. **POSITIONING:** From (7,1), I'll have access to (8,1) apple and can move right toward the bottom-right corner\n4. **AGGRESSION:** While Snake #0 is up at (3,6), I'm controlling the bottom-right quadrant\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nFrom (7,1), I can go RIGHT to (8,1) next turn for another apple! That puts me at 19-17. Then I'll have options to go UP toward (8,6) or stay mobile along the bottom edge. I need to keep Snake #0 boxed in the upper-left. They're stuck in their own body patterns up there. I control the board now! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! DOWN IS THE MOVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Let's check the board state:\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD AT (7,1):**\n\n1. **UP to (7,2):** My body! The first element in my body list is (7,2). That's where my neck is! \u274c DEAD! (Backwards movement into own body)\n2. **DOWN to (7,0):** Row 0 shows `A T T T T T T . A .` - (7,0) is '.' - EMPTY! And it's NOT in my body (my lowest body is at y=0 but only up to x=6). \u2705 SAFE! Good spot for positioning.\n3. **LEFT to (6,1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T T T T A A .` - (6,1) is 'T' (part of my body). \u274c DEAD!\n4. **RIGHT to (8,1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T T T T A A .` - (8,1) is marked as 'A'! That's an apple! It's not in my body (I own x=6 and below). \u2705 SAFE!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n- **UP to (7,2):** That's my current body. Instant death. NOPE.\n- **DOWN to (7,0):** Safe empty space. Puts me at the bottom edge, x=7. I can then move RIGHT to (8,0) which has an apple (Row 0 shows A at (8,0)), or LEFT to clear space. Good defensive spot, controls bottom edge.\n- **LEFT to (6,1):** That's my body. NOPE.\n- **RIGHT to (8,1):** **IMMEDIATE APPLE!** I eat and grow to 19-17! Massive lead. From there, I can go UP to (8,2) (empty), or DOWN to (8,0) (which also has an apple), or RIGHT to (9,1) (safe edge). This keeps me MOBILE.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **RIGHT to (8,1)**! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 Here's why:\n1. **DOUBLE APPLE POTENTIAL:** From (8,1), I can go DOWN to (8,0) next turn for ANOTHER apple (Row 0 shows apple at (8,0)). That could be 20-17! Or I can go UP to (8,2) for board control.\n2. **LEAD EXPANSION:** I'm already at 18-17. Eating this apple makes it 19-17. Snake #0 is stuck in the upper-left corner at (2,6) surrounded by their own body. They can't score fast!\n3. **POSITIONING:** From the bottom-right corner (8,1), I own the entire lower half of the board. Snake #0 is trapped in the upper-left quadrant by their own tail loop.\n4. **SAFETY:** (8,1) is confirmed empty and not part of my body. I have clear moves from there.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat at (8,1) \u2192 Next turn, move DOWN to (8,0) for the second apple \u2192 Then use the bottom-right edge to maneuver while Snake #0 dies in their own trap. They have to loop their tail eventually, and when they do, I'll be doubling my lead. 20-17 is the goal! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! RIGHT IS THE PLAY! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 RIGHT",

Let's analyze the battlefield from my new position at **(8,1)** after the last move.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD AT (8,1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8,2):** Row 2 is `T T T T T T T T . .` (the `.` is at (8,2)). It's empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n2.  **DOWN to (8,0):** Row 0 is `A T T T T T T . A .`. (8,0) is an **APPLE**. \ud83c\udf4e It's not in my body. \u2705 SAFE (and delicious).\n3.  **LEFT to (7,1):** Row 1 is `T T T T T T T T 1 .`. (7,1) is currently 'T' (my body). \u274c DEAD!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,1):** Row 1 is `T T T T T T T T 1 .`. (9,1) is empty (dot). \u2705 SAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nI'm sandwiched between my own body on the left and the edge on the right.\n- **LEFT** is suicide. No.\n- **UP** to (8,2) is safe, but it's a tight corridor above me (Row 2 is almost entirely my body). Moving UP limits my immediate future options significantly. I'd be wiggling in a small space.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,1) puts me on the edge at x=9. From there, I can only go UP or DOWN. It's safe, but it's a dead end for my head movement direction. I'd have to turn back immediately.\n- **DOWN** to (8,0) is **THE PLAY**. Why?\n    1.  **IMMEDIATE CONTENT:** It's an apple! That makes my score **20-18**. A two-point lead is huge.\n    2.  **BOARD CONTROL:** From (8,0), I'm on the bottom edge. From there, I can go:\n        - **LEFT to (7,0):** Empty (checked last turn).\n        - **RIGHT to (9,0):** Empty.\n        - **UP to (8,1):** Safe return path.\n    3.  **ENEMY STATUS:** Snake #0 is at (2,5). They are trapped in the upper-left quadrant. They can't reach me. I own the bottom-right.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nEat the apple at **(8,0)** to go **20-18**. This gives me a massive buffer. From (8,0), I'll have mobility on the bottom row. I can sweep leftwards along the bottom edge (Row 0 has apples at (0,0) and (8,0) is now mine), clearing space and forcing Snake #0 to eventually hit their own tail. 20 apples is the psychological victory.\n\n**DOWN** is the move. \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

My body is currently filling rows 0 and 1. Moving UP to (9,1) keeps me on the edge. I need to navigate up the right side (x=9) and then sweep left across the top (y=9) to clear space.\n- **THE OBSTACLE:** Look at the board. Row 1 is almost entirely my body (T's). Moving UP to (9,1) is safe *now*, but next turn I'll be at (9,1). My only paths will be UP to (9,2) or LEFT to (8,1). (8,1) is currently empty (it was my head previously, now it's part of the body moving down). Wait, checking the board state again... (8,1) is currently a dot (empty).
