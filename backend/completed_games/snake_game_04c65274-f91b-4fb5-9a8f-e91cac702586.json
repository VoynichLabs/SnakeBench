Moving left brings me directly toward that apple, while keeping three safe follow\u2011up moves (up, down, or another left). The enemy snake at (3,7) cannot reach the apple without crossing my body, so I can secure it safely.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1. Move **LEFT** now to (1,8).  \n2. Next turn move **LEFT** again to (0,8) and eat the apple.  \n3. Then move **UP** to (0,9) and eat the second apple.  \n4. Afterwards head down toward the remaining apples at (2,3), (1,1), and (2,0), always checking that the enemy cannot cut me off.  \n\nThis sequence maximizes my apple count while avoiding immediate collisions and keeping future options open.\n\nLEFT",
