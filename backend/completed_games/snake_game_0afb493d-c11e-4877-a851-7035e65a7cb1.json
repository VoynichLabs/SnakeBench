Look at that starting position!\n\nMy head is at (5, 2). Short and plump, ready to grow!\nThe enemy, Snake #0, is way up there at (9, 4). He's cornered himself already, what a noob! \ud83d\ude02\n\n**Current Strategy:** We need to spread out and take over the middle of the board. My first goal is to grab that apple at (5, 3) or (4, 3) or even (3, 2). I need length, and I need it fast, so I can start pressuring the opponent. Right now, safety is key, and securing a growth advantage is paramount.\n\n**Analyzing the Moves (Turn 0):**\n\nMy position: (5, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** This is an apple! Instant growth! Also keeps me central and away from the edges. Seems like a fantastic start. Is it safe?\n    *   *Snake #0's potential moves:* Snake #0 is at (9, 4). He's probably going UP to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3) to get out of the corner or grab that apple at (8, 5) or (8, 1). There is absolutely zero chance of a head-on collision or collision with his body (which doesn't exist yet). **SAFE and AWESOME.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** This is safe, but no apple. Moves me toward a lower density of apples immediately. Why would I do that when I can grow? **SUB-OPTIMAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe, no immediate apple, but positions me for (4, 3) or (3, 2). Okay, but not *the best*. **DECENT.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe, but no immediate apple (closest is (7, 0) or (8, 1), which are far). **DECENT.**\n\n**The Verdict:** Moving UP to (5, 3) secures an immediate apple and puts us in a dominant central position for the next move. We take this free growth, no question, chat! We need that length! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):** Secure the early apples around (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 2). Establish a central body presence. Snake #0 is way off on the right edge. Once we have 3-4 body segments, we can start driving toward the right side and cut him off from the main board, forcing him into his little corner. Get big, then get aggressive!\n\nUP",

The enemy snake #1 is at (5,2). Both of us are just heads right now - no bodies to worry about yet. \n\nLooking at our options:\n- **UP** to (9,5): Safe! No immediate threats.\n- **DOWN** to (9,3): Safe! No immediate threats.\n- **LEFT** to (8,4): Safe! No immediate threats.\n- **RIGHT** to (10,4): OFF THE BOARD! Dead instantly. Not happening.\n\nWe gotta be smart here. Since we're both at 0 apples, we need to start collecting ASAP. Let's see what's reachable:\n- (9,5) is UP - that's closer to apples at (8,5) and (8,8)\n- (8,4) is LEFT - that's closer to apples at (8,5) and (8,1)\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are solid moves that open up multiple future options. But here's the play - we're in the bottom-right corner. If we go UP, we can start building toward the center where all the apples are spawning. Going LEFT just takes us along the edge.\n\nUP is the move! It gives us more flexibility and gets us toward the apple cluster. Plus, if the enemy tries to box us in, we'll have escape routes upward.\n\n**UP**",

EZ lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's look at the board state and dissect our archrival, Snake #0. He's still small, but he's looming up there, far away. We need to capitalize on this early lead and build an impenetrable wall!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 3). Body at [(5, 2)]. We just got longer, chat!\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (9, 5). He moved from (9, 4) to (9, 5). Looks like he's scouting the edge, maybe trying to grab that apple at (8, 5) or the one further up at (8, 8). He's currently in a super restricted area.\n\n**Strategic Goal:** Continue growing in the center, positioning ourselves to dominate the top-right quadrant where the enemy is stuck, OR use our central position to grab resources and then wall him off later. I favor immediate growth and establishing a control zone.\n\n**Available Apples Around Me:**\n*   (4, 3) - Directly LEFT.\n*   (3, 2) - DOWN/LEFT.\n*   (0, 2), (1, 2) - Further LEFT.\n*   (8, 1), (7, 0) - Further RIGHT/DOWN.\n\nI love the looks of (4, 3). It\u2019s easy growth, and it expands my influence toward the central-left side, giving me space to maneuver.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (5, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision (body is at (5, 2)). Safe from wall (plenty of space).\n    *   *Opportunity:* No apple. Moves me slightly away from the majority of immediate cluster apples.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* Snake #0 is at (9, 5). He's 4 columns away. Zero risk of collision. **SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DANGER!** This is where my body (tail) is! Moving back onto my own body segment is instant death! NOPE! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision. This is an apple!\n    *   *Opportunity:* Instant growth, good positioning toward the cluster of apples on the left.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* Still zero risk. **SAFE and AWESOME.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No apple. Moves me toward the right side, but I don't want to get too close to the enemy before I'm long enough to dictate the flow.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* Zero risk. **SAFE.**\n\n**Selection Rationale:**\nThe move to (4, 3) is a no-brainer, chat! It's *immediate* growth (doubling our initial length in the first two moves *is* content!), and it continues our push to take control of the center-left. We are establishing dominance quickly. Getting to length 3 means we can start being much more aggressive in future positioning.\n\n**Plan (Next Few Turns):**\nAfter grabbing (4, 3) (Turn 1), our head will be at (4, 3) and body at [(5, 3), (5, 2)]. The next logical targets are (3, 2) or (2, 1) to continue growing down and left, or potentially moving UP/LEFT into the (1, 4) apple. We need to secure length 4-5 before we worry about engaging the rival. He\u2019s going to be busy dealing with the limitations of the edge until he builds length himself. We build up, and then we crush him! We need to make a wall, chat! A big, beautiful wall!\n\nLEFT",

Can I get a Pog in the chat for the length of 3 we\u2019ve achieved already? L-E-N-G-T-H! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (4, 3). Body is [(5, 3), (5, 2)]. We are perfectly positioned in the central-bottom quadrant. We are a threat!\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (8, 5). Body is [(9, 5)]. He just ate an apple too! He's trying to keep up. He moved from (9, 5) to (8, 5), which is a move LEFT. This confirms he is trying to escape the top-right corner or establish dominance in that quadrant. He's at length 2.\n\n**Strategic Goal:** We need to keep growing and pressuring the enemy. He's moving left, so we need to consolidate our central position and potentially move up to cut him off if he tries to drop down the middle. For now, maximal growth and safe maneuvering are key.\n\n**Available Immediate Apples (from (4, 3)):**\nThe board is littered with apples!\n*   (3, 2) - DOWN/LEFT. Excellent target.\n*   (1, 4) - UP/LEFT. Excellent target.\n*   (3, 6) - Further UP/LEFT.\n*   (6, 4) - To the RIGHT.\n\nThe most attractive moves that offer both growth and good board positioning are DOWN/LEFT and UP/LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self-collision (body is (5, 3)). Safe from wall.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No immediate apple, but sets up for (1, 4) or (3, 6). Moves toward the center of the board, offering excellent maneuverability. Gaining altitude is always a good move.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* Snake #0 is at (8, 5). No risk of collision. **SAFE.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Avoids my current body segments.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No immediate apple, but sets up for (3, 2). It crowds the lower part of the board, which isn't ideal for large maneuvers down the line.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* No risk. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No apple. This moves us immediately next to the delicious (3, 2) apple, setting up an easy grab next turn if we go DOWN. It also opens up the path toward the cluster of apples at (0, 2) and (1, 2) and (0, 6) and (1, 4). This move gives us maximum options for Turn 3.\n    *   *Enemy Threat:* No risk. **SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DANGER!** This is where my body (head segment from last turn) is! Moving back onto my own body is instant death! NOPE! **ELIMINATED.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Selection Rationale: LEFT is the POWER MOVE!**\nWe need to keep maximum options open. Moving LEFT to (3, 3) immediately sets us up for a guaranteed apple grab on Turn 3 by moving DOWN to (3, 2). This path uses our current size to dominate the bottom-left area, allowing us to grow rapidly.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 4), the next apple targets are (1, 4) (requires two moves) or (6, 4) (requires two moves).\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 3), we are one move away from (3, 2), and two moves away from (1, 4). This trajectory seems to maximize early potential growth. We are hunting for length 5 or 6 before considering cutting off the rival.\n\nThe enemy is moving to (8, 5). He is relatively far and restricted. We need to focus on securing our lead through rapid growth without getting trapped ourselves. Moving LEFT maintains our flexibility in the highly contested central zone.\n\n**Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 2 (Current):** Move LEFT to (3, 3).\n2.  **Turn 3 (Next):** Move DOWN to (3, 2) to snag another apple (reaching length 4).\n3.  **Turn 4:** From (3, 2), move UP/LEFT toward (1, 4) or (0, 2) to continue growth and pressure the center.\n\nLet's do this! We are taking the left side, chat! Wall him off later, grow now!\n\nLEFT",

Opens top-right corner, but we'd miss the immediate apple at (8,5)\n- **DOWN** to (9,4): Safe! Takes us away from apples, not ideal\n- **LEFT** to (8,5): THIS IS THE MOVE! We eat the apple immediately and grow! Score becomes 2-2\n- **RIGHT** to (10,5): OFF THE BOARD! Dead instantly. Not happening.\n\nWe gotta be smart here. Snake #1 has body segments blocking them - they can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from (4,3). If they go RIGHT to (3,3), they're heading toward the center where we want to dominate.\n\nHere's the play - we need to start collecting apples ASAP to catch up. LEFT to (8,5) is GOLDEN! We eat that apple immediately, grow to length 2, and tie the score at 2-2. This positions us perfectly to start dominating the center of the board and control the apple spawns.\n\n**LEFT**",

We are at length 3, and we moved to (3, 3) last turn, setting ourselves up for a buffet! Can I get a F-E-A-S-T in the chat?!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3, 3). Body is [(4, 3), (5, 3)]. We are perfectly positioned to strike the low-hanging fruit.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7, 5). Body is [(8, 5)]. He's still floating around the mid-right area. He is also length 2, so we have the length advantage, 3 vs 2! Let's leverage that!\n\n**Strategic Goal:** Rapid growth and board domination. We planned to grab the apple at (3, 2). Let's see if that's still the safest and best move!\n\n**Available Immediate Apples (from (3, 3)):**\n*   **(3, 2):** Directly DOWN. An absolute must-grab!\n*   **(1, 2):** Two steps DOWN/LEFT.\n*   **(3, 6):** Three steps UP.\n*   **(1, 4):** UP/LEFT.\n\nThe (3, 2) apple is the lowest hanging fruit, literally! Grabbing this takes us to length 4 and cements our control over the central-bottom quadrant.\n\n**Evaluating Opponent's Threat (Snake #0 at (7, 5)):**\nThe enemy is far away and currently poses no immediate threat of collision. He's at (7, 5). He will likely move toward the cluster of apples around (6, 5), (6, 6), or perhaps drop down toward (7, 0) or (8, 1). We are safe from him regardless of his move.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (3, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No immediate apple. Sets up for (3, 6) or perhaps (1, 4) if we curve left. It\u2019s a good positional move, but why delay growth?\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. This is the apple grab!\n    *   *Opportunity:* Eats the apple, increasing our length to 4 and maintaining our scoring lead. It is a calculated power play.\n    *   *Follow-up:* From (3, 2), we can move toward (1, 2) or (0, 2) or cut back toward the center-left. Excellent options remain.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Opportunity:* No apple. Moves us closer to the walls, which can be restricting early on, but potentially sets up for (2, 1) apple. We delay the guaranteed apple grab at (3, 2).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DANGER!** This cell (4, 3) is our current *first* body segment! Moving into it is an immediate self-collision! **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**Selection Rationale: DOWN for the Apple!**\nThe plan from last turn was flawless, chat! We move DOWN to (3, 2), secure the third apple, and reach length 4. This is an optimal move for growth and maintaining board position. We are dominating the bottom half of the board, forcing the opponent to deal with the upper half or risk a deep dive into our growing territory. We are maximizing our lead and preparing to turn UP or LEFT after the grab.\n\nThe enemy is focusing on (7, 5). Let him chase his apples. We are building an unstoppable fortress down here! Are we getting this W, chat?! YES WE ARE!\n\n**Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1.  **Turn 3 (Current):** Move DOWN to (3, 2) to eat the apple (length 4).\n2.  **Turn 4:** From (3, 2), we should assess moving LEFT to (2, 2) to continue positioning for the cluster of apples like (1, 2) and (0, 2), or UP to (3, 3) to maintain altitude. We need to stay flexible. We are going to prioritize moving toward the corner apples to secure a long, dominant body.\n\nDOWN",

In this case, (3, 3) is still our body.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Not an apple, but it moves us closer to the (2, 1) apple if we curve left later. This also potentially sets up a massive U-turn block in the bottom corner.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us toward the (2, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 2) apples. This is excellent for control and growth. From (2, 2), we have multiple follow-up options.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. No immediate apple. Moves us closer to the center, away from the left wall, but away from the apple cluster we're targeting.\n\n**Strategic Comparison & Opponent Prediction:**\n\nThe most promising move is **LEFT to (2, 2)**. It maintains our momentum toward immediate growth targets on the left side: (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2). This path builds a huge wall on the bottom of the map.\n\nWhat is the opponent doing at (6, 5)?\n*   He sees the apple clusters UP and RIGHT (6, 6) or (8, 6), or perhaps he'll dive down for (7, 0).\n*   *Possible moves for Snake #0 (6, 5):* UP (6, 6 - apple), RIGHT (7, 5 - apple), DOWN (6, 4 - apple), or LEFT (5, 5).\n    *   If he goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT, he stays far away.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (5, 5), he is starting to move toward the center.\n\nWe are completely safe regardless of his move. He is length 3, and we are length 4. We want to maximize this length advantage to reduce his available movement channels.\n\n**Decision Rationale: LEFT to (2, 2)!**\nThis move is purely about position and sustained growth. We secure the next segment of the left wall, setting up to grab (2, 1) or (1, 2) next turn. We are locking down the entire bottom quadrant. We are building the fortress, chat! Who's going to stop us?! NO ONE!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Self Note):**\n1.  **Turn 4 (Current):** LEFT to (2, 2).\n2.  **Turn 5:** From (2, 2), move DOWN to (2, 1) to grab the apple (length 5).\n3.  **Turn 6:** From (2, 1), move LEFT to (1, 1), then UP toward (1, 2) and (0, 2).\n\nThis plan maximizes our length and traps the opponent in the upper-right quadrant. Let's make this move happen!\n\nLEFT",

We are building a fortress on the bottom-left, ready to feast on these clustered apples. Who's ready for some high-IQ movement? Let's check the state and plan the next move. We are LIVE!\n\n**State Analysis (Turn 5):**\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(2, 2)**. Body: $[(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]$. Length 4.\n    *   *Goal:* Grab the apple at (2, 1) or (1, 2) to increase our length advantage and secure the corner.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(5, 5)**. Body: $[(6, 5), (7, 5)]$. Length 3.\n    *   *Enemy Position:* They are chilling in the center-right. They have apples around them: (6, 6), (8, 6), (6, 4), (5, 9). They are likely going to move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**Possible Moves from My Head (2, 2):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves us towards the apples at (1, 2), (0, 2). Good option.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. **APPLE!** (2, 1) is an apple. This is prime growth. Best option for score/length.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. **APPLE!** (1, 2) is an apple. Also, prime growth, and positions us for (0, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* **DANGER!** (3, 2) is our first body segment (the neck). Self-collision! **ELIMINATED!** \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1) [Apple!], and LEFT (1, 2) [Apple!]. This is a good position, Chat!\n\n**Strategic Choice: DOWN to (2, 1) vs. LEFT to (1, 2)**\n\nBoth moves result in capturing an apple and increasing our lead to 4-2! Which one gives us better board control?\n\n*   **If we move DOWN to (2, 1) (Apple):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (2, 1). We can move LEFT to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 1) or UP to (2, 2) (now empty).\n    *   This secures the bottom edge and pivots us toward the highly valuable (0, 2) apple, keeping movement open.\n\n*   **If we move LEFT to (1, 2) (Apple):**\n    *   Next turn, we are at (1, 2). We can move UP to (1, 3), DOWN to (1, 1), or LEFT to (0, 2) (next apple!).\n    *   Moving LEFT sets up a two-turn apple chain: (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (0, 2). This is ultra-efficient for building a long wall on the left side.\n\n**Comparing Control and Efficiency:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 2) is slightly superior because it immediately sets up the next apple capture at (0, 2) by simply continuing LEFT, locking down the left border. The trajectory is smoother for maximum growth in this specific area. This is how you seize control of the map, Chat! We are building a massive barricade!\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake #0 at 5, 5):**\n\nThe enemy is far away, so no immediate head-on collision danger.\n*   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (4, 5) or DOWN to (5, 4), they are trying to cross the mid-line.\n*   If Snake #0 goes UP to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (6, 5) (Body part! $5 \\to 6$ is wrong, old head was 6, Body is 6,5, 7,5. New Head is 5, 5. Body is 6, 5, 7, 5).\n    *   From (5, 5), if they move RIGHT to (6, 5), they hit their own body! **DANGER!** (6, 5) is their neck. So they cannot move RIGHT.\n    *   Safe moves for Snake #0 are UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), or LEFT (4, 5).\n\nSince they can't move RIGHT, they will likely go UP toward the apples (5, 9), (6, 6) or DOWN to find space. Regardless, they are far from us. Our move is risk-free relative to the opponent.\n\n**Final Decision:** Maximize length and board control! We move LEFT to (1, 2), then secure (0, 2) next turn. This is the path of the champion!\n\n**Long Term Plan (Self Note for Turn 6):**\n1. **Turn 5 (Current):** LEFT to (1, 2) [Apple]. Length is now 5.\n2. **Turn 6:** From (1, 2), move LEFT to (0, 2) [Apple]. Length is now 6. Dominate the West wall!\n3. **Turn 7:** Move DOWN to (0, 1) or UP to (0, 3) to continue growth and wall construction.\n\nLEFT",

They are still lingering around (4, 5), maybe eyeing the (3, 6) or (0, 6) apples, or maybe they are targeting that (5, 9) apple. Their position is loose, and they haven't committed to a wall yet. This gives us space!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Eliminate Suicide Moves from (1, 2)**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** Safe. Keeps us along the left side.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Safe. Keeps us along the left side, slightly away from the (2, 1) apple we may use later.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe! (2, 2) was our old neck, which is now clear. Retreating back toward the center.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe! **APPLE!** This is the planned move. Hits the border and gains length.\n\nAll moves are safe from self-collision and border crashes. Now let's check for enemy collision, which is extremely unlikely given the distance (Enemy at 4, 5).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Maximizing Lead and Board Domination**\n\nThe strategy from last turn was to move LEFT to (0, 2) and aggressively build a wall along the $x=0$ axis. This move hits the jackpot!\n\n**Move: LEFT to (0, 2) (Apple!)**\n\n*   **Pro:** Immediate apple gain, extending the lead to 5-2. Our length grows to 6. We establish control of the critical dead-end wall at $x=0$, boxing ourselves out of that dangerous zone, but giving us maximum flexibility along the edge for future vertical movement.\n*   **Next Turn Position:** (0, 2). We can then move UP to (0, 3) or DOWN to (0, 1), continuing to hug the wall and potentially hit the (0, 6) apple further up.\n\n**Alternative Move: UP to (1, 3)**\n\n*   **Pro:** Moves us higher up the board, offering more central options later, and positions us for the (1, 4) apple.\n*   **Con:** Delays the apple at (0, 2), and doesn't immediately lockdown the border. The enemy might try to sweep the left side if they come down hard.\n\n**Conclusion:** We stick to the plan! We need to grow as fast as possible to make our body a massive obstacle. Moving LEFT to (0, 2) is the most risk-free and growth-maximized move. We are turning into a literal blockade! Box life is the best life!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Enemy Prediction and Counter-Strategy**\n\nEnemy Head at (4, 5). Safe moves are UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), or LEFT (3, 5). They cannot go RIGHT to (5, 5) (their neck).\n\n*   If they go **UP to (4, 6)** (likely): They are targeting the cluster of apples above them, potentially (3, 6) or (0, 6).\n*   If they go **LEFT to (3, 5)**: They are trying to move toward the center-left. This would still be *three* turns away from being a physical threat to our wall, so we are safe.\n\nNo matter where Snake #0 goes, they are focused on their territory, and we are focused on ours. Our growth advantage is paramount. We are going LEFT!\n\n---\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns (Future Me, Listen Up!):**\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (Current):** LEFT to (0, 2) [Apple]. Length 6. Lock down the West wall.\n2.  **Turn 7:** From (0, 2), we should move UP to (0, 3). This keeps our tail near the bottom-left corner, maximizing usable board space (The enemy is not down here, so we don't need to circle back yet). We maintain an aggressive posture up the $x=0$ wall toward the (0, 6) apple.\n3.  **Turn 8:** Move UP to (0, 4), continuing the wall build, aiming for that (0, 6) apple.\n\nThe plan is sound. We are building the Wall of Shame for our opponent! LET'S GET IT!\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating the board, and our opponent (ID 0) is still milling around the middle!\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Turn 7 Analysis: Building the Western Wall! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**SCORE ALERT:** 5 apples! Opponent has 2! We are crushing the apple game and the length game! The pressure is ON!

A .\n 0 . . . . . . . A . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe enemy is now at (3, 5), trying to move toward the left/center. They clearly see the opportunity for space. Their tail is still at (5, 5). They are highly focused on the upper-left quadrant. This is fantastic news for us, as it leaves the bottom half of the board entirely open for our maneuvers!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Eliminate Suicide Moves from (0, 2)**\n\nRemember, we are at the border $x=0$.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 3):** Safe. Continues the wall build.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 1):** Safe. Keeps us along the left side.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):** Safe! (1, 2) was our old neck, which is now clear. Backtracking into the body's path is safe *unless* the cell is still part of the moving body segment. Since we ate an apple last turn, our tail (4, 3) DID NOT move, and our old neck (1, 2) is now free space. This is a common situation after eating!\n4.  **LEFT to (-1, 2):** **DEATH!** Border crash! NO THROWING!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Maximizing Lead and Board Domination**\n\nThe long-term plan was UP to (0, 3). Does this still hold? Yes!\n\n**Move: UP to (0, 3)**\n\n*   **Pro:** Continues our aggressive wall build along the $x=0$ axis. It positions us perfectly to snag the (0, 6) apple in three turns. It maintains maximum distance from the enemy, who is currently chilling at (3, 5). This makes us longer and more of a threat without having to engage directly yet.\n*   **Next Turn Position:** (0, 3). We have two safe moves available: UP (0, 4) and RIGHT (1, 3).\n\n**Alternative Move: RIGHT to (1, 2)**\n\n*   **Pro:** Keeps our options open, moving us slightly away from the border. Potentially positions us for the (1, 4) apple.\n*   **Con:** It sacrifices the aggressive wall-building momentum. We want to be a huge blocker, and staying on the $x=0$ edge is the fastest way to get long without risk of getting flanked.\n\n**Alternative Move: DOWN to (0, 1)**\n\n*   **Pro:** Positions us near the tail end of our snake, maximizing usable area (often a good defensive move).\n*   **Con:** Moves us away from all nearby accessible apples, wasting movement while the enemy is growing. Slowing down now is dangerous!\n\n**Conclusion:** We stick to the main strategy! We are going UP! We want that (0, 6) apple and we want to solidify the leftmost column as ours. We are building a fortress!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Enemy Prediction and Counter-Strategy**\n\nEnemy Head at (3, 5). Safe moves are UP (3, 6) [APPLE!], DOWN (3, 4), or RIGHT (4, 5) (their old neck, now free). They cannot go LEFT (2, 5) (clear), but they cannot go into (2, 5) if their body is 4, 5, 5, 5? Wait, enemy body is [(4, 5), (5, 5)]. Okay, so they moved from (4, 5) to (3, 5).\nPossible enemy moves from (3, 5):\n1.  **UP to (3, 6) [Apple]:** Very likely. They get longer, and their head starts pushing toward the top center.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** Less likely, as it moves away from all the active apples.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** Likely, if they want to get to the (0, 6) apple before us.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Safe, but retreats from the apple.\n\nIf they move UP to (3, 6) (Apple!), they reach length 4 and are very far from us. No collision threat.\nIf they move LEFT to (2, 5), they are moving toward our segment (1, 2). Still no immediate threat this turn.\n\nOur move UP to (0, 3) is safe and maximizes our growth potential. We have the huge advantage, so we must press it! UP UP UP! Time to climb the wall, folks!\n\n---\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (Current):** UP to (0, 3). Continue Western Wall.\n2.  **Turn 8:** From (0, 3), move UP to (0, 4). Continue the wall, position for the (0, 6) apple.\n3.  **Turn 9:** From (0, 4), move UP to (0, 5). Almost there!\n4.  **Turn 10:** From (0, 5), move UP to (0, 6) [Apple]! BOOM! Length 7!\n\nLet's maintain this momentum!\n\nUP",
