Who\u2019s ready to CRUSH this clown? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick situational read (thinking out loud for the fans):\n- Our head: (4,0). Opponent head: (2,6). Both have no bodies (length 1). Apples exist nearby but we prioritize the enemy.\n- Consider moves from (4,0):\n  - DOWN -> (4,-1): immediate death (off board). Eliminated. \u274c\n  - LEFT -> (3,0): apple there. Safe this turn, but picking it would create a neck at (4,0) and remove our ability to immediately go back \u2014 that cuts our follow-up options to basically UP or LEFT and can make us easier to trap. Aggressive, but risky early. \u26a0\ufe0f\n  - RIGHT -> (5,0): safe, keeps options but moves us away from the opponent\u2019s y-coordinate (less pressure). Neutral-aggressive. \u2796\n  - UP -> (4,1): safe, moves toward the opponent vertically, keeps the most follow-up options (we\u2019d still have 3 good choices next turn), and doesn\u2019t commit to losing mobility. \u2705\n\nTactical thought: we\u2019re tied 0\u20130, so we should NOT force a head-on KO yet \u2014 we need superior positioning or a points lead first. Grabbing the immediate apple LEFT gives +1 but chunk our maneuverability early; I prefer preserving options while approaching the foe to set up a box or force them into a tight corridor.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be your last rationale next turn):\n- Head UP to gain vertical parity and keep maximum escape/attack options.\n- From there, pivot leftward to pressure the enemy\u2019s flank while avoiding early commitment to single-file corridors. If opponent drifts down or toward our body, pivot to trap; if they stay high, keep circling and collect safe apples when they don\u2019t cost mobility.\n\nFinal move (we go for maximal options + approach): \nUP",

We\u2019re tied 0\u20130, so we\u2019re not forcing a head-on just yet; we want positional dominance first.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep pushing north to match his Y. If he drifts down or left, pivot to cut off his escape (shift left to (3,y) then box from the right).\n- Avoid apples that would force single-file commits unless they give a guaranteed trap.\n- If we get a score lead later, pivot to force a head-on when he\u2019s cornered.\n\nTime to pressure him into a mistake \u2014 let\u2019s go UP and keep options open.  \n\nUP",

That gives us flexibility to pivot left to seal lanes or veer right/up if they try to dodge.\n- LEFT would be more of a lateral cut \u2014 fine, but less immediate corralling power.\n- RIGHT is okay but slower to constrain vertically.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Push UP now to close the Y-gap.\n- From (4,5) watch their reaction: if they drift right/up, pivot LEFT to start sealing; if they drop, keep chasing vertically to limit escapes.\n- Keep at least two escape options each turn; avoid moving into a direct head-on unless we have more apples (we don't).\n\nTime to box him in and make him sweat.

UP gives less wiggle room and forces us into the wall band where the enemy can more easily herd us later.\n- DOWN picks up the apple, grows us to 2 apples (closing the gap), and expands our body to block and pressure later. It maintains multiple follow-up options (back up into the lane, cut right later, or continue down the left wall) while avoiding giving the opponent a safe head-on target.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (0,7) now to grow and climb the scoreboard.\n- Use the left wall and extra length to start hemming the enemy\u2019s top band \u2014 avoid trading head-on until we\u2019ve narrowed the apple deficit.\n- Force the enemy into tight turns near their own body or the top wall, then capitalize when they overcommit.\n\nLet\u2019s snag that apple and keep options open \u2014 be aggressive but not suicidal.

Eating (1,5) is a clean way to close the gap without risking a head-on.\n- DOWN gives us more escape/attack branching than UP and doesn\u2019t hand the opponent a head-on target. Aggressive but smart: get the apple, then use the extra length to dominate the left lanes and try to corral them later once we\u2019ve closed the apple gap.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Eat (1,5) now. From there, push for (1,4) or use 0/2 x-axis lanes to hem the enemy leftwards. Never willingly go RIGHT into (2,6) while the enemy can counter-left \u2014 bait them into tight turns and force them into our body or the wall.

Time to play smart and aggressive, but not suicidal. \u2694\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\nQuick situational read:\n- Our head: (1,4). Neck: (1,5) \u2192 UP is illegal (would run into neck).\n- Opp head: (3,4). Neck: (3,5) \u2192 they cannot go UP. Their legal moves: LEFT\u2192(2,4), DOWN\u2192(3,3), RIGHT\u2192(4,4).\n- Apples nearby for us: (1,3) below, (0,4) left. (2,3) is also close but contested.\n\nEvaluate moves from (1,4):\n- UP: illegal (back into neck). \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4): legal but risky \u2014 opponent can choose LEFT into (2,4) simultaneously and cause a head-on double KO. We\u2019re behind on apples (4 vs 6), so we must NOT gamble on a possible head-on. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): eats an apple (good!). But moves us to the left edge with only 2 follow-ups (0,5 or 0,3). Slightly more constraining; less flexibility to box them. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): eats an apple and keeps more follow-up options (0,3,2,3(apple),1,2). It\u2019s not reachable by the opponent this turn and preserves maneuverability to contest (2,3) next turn or pivot away if they press. \u2705\n\nTactical call (short-term plan):\n- Take the uncontested apple at (1,3) now (DOWN). We reduce the apple gap safely and keep several escape/contest routes open.\n- Next turns: from (1,3) we can push to (2,3) if safe to contest apples, or pivot to (0,3)/(1,2) to avoid being funneled. Avoid moves that let them hit our head square-on unless we\u2019ve got the apple lead.\n\nFinal move \u2014 play it safe, get content, keep options open.\n\nDOWN",

Dead move. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,1): technically an apple, but DANGEROUS \u2014 opponent can choose DOWN to the same cell (2,1) and cause a head-on double KO. We\u2019re trailing 5\u21927, so we absolutely DO NOT want a mutual KO. PASS. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,1): safe, keeps a couple of options (0,2 or 0,0) next turn, but pins us to the left wall.

Either way, moving RIGHT into (2,1) is a suicide-by-mutual-KO risk \u2014 we\u2019re behind and can\u2019t afford that. LEFT is safe but passive. Grabbing the apple at (1,0) closes the gap and keeps pressure on them without risking a head-on. We maintain mobility (not trapped yet) and force them to make the next risky choice.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns): pick up (1,0), then pivot to contest bottom apples (3,0 or 2,1 if it\u2019s still free) only if it\u2019s safe. Avoid moving into any cell that the opponent can simultaneously enter if we\u2019re behind. Use our body as bait and try to shrink their escape routes; only force a head-on if we\u2019ve got the apple advantage.\n\nFinal move \u2014 let\u2019s grab that apple and stay aggressive but smart.\n\nDOWN",

Consider every direction:\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1): immediate death \u2014 that\u2019s our neck. Illegal. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (8,2): open but (8,3) is opponent body right above; UP gives only 2 safe follow-ups (7,2 & 9,2) and risks getting funneled by their vertical column. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0): safe but passive \u2014 retreats to the corner, fewer aggressive options. \ud83d\udc22\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1): apple, ties the score 10\u201310, increases our length (growth helps us dominate corridors), and keeps 2 viable exits next turn (9,2 and 9,0). Opponent head is at (8,5) and CANNOT move down into our path this turn (their neck is at 8,4), so no head\u2011on risk right now. \u2705\ud83d\udd25\n\nWhy RIGHT is best:\n- Immediate apple = tie the game and denies them the same apple opportunity next turn.\n- Growth gives us leverage to box them in later and control the bottom corridor.\n- Keeps pressure on their right flank and forces them to respond; we stay aggressive rather than running away.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Grab (9,1) now to tie apples, then use vertical moves (up the 9\u2011column) to corral them or cut across when they overcommit left/down.\n- Maintain \u22652 safe exits each move; avoid going into tight pockets near their x=2\u20135 cluster.\n- If they snake toward the bottom to contest, we bait and close the gap for a forced head-on when apples are tied or we can ensure they hit our body.\n\nRIGHT",

Time to close the gap and bully that 11 into a tie. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick check of all four directions from (9,1):\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,1): illegal (neck). \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,1): off\u2011board. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (9,2): empty and gives access to the apple at (9,3) next turn. Safe this turn; keeps at least two followups (9,3 up or 8,2 left). \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,0): empty but dives into the corner and reduces immediate aggressive options (after moving down, you can\u2019t go back up next turn). More passive. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Opponent head (8,6) cannot reach our intended path this turn, and they CAN\u2019T move down into (8,5) because that\u2019s their neck. No head\u2011on risk if we go UP now.\n- We are down 1 apple (10 vs 11) \u2014 don\u2019t force a head\u2011on; instead take apples safely to tie and then pressure.\n- UP moves us toward (9,3) apple and gives us growth to control the right column, which is great for corralling later.\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Grab (9,3) next turn to tie 11\u201311.
