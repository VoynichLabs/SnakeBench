DOWN moves me toward (5, 7), which is a clear path downward. LEFT moves me toward (3, 9). \n\nLooking at the board, moving DOWN to (5, 8) puts me in excellent position to collect the apple at (5, 7) next turn. This is a direct, safe path with good follow-up options. The enemy at (7, 1) is far away and not a threat.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Focus on collecting the nearby apple at (5, 7) by moving down, then reassess for other apples like (3, 9) or (1, 9) on the top row.\n\nDOWN",

It gives me an immediate apple (1st point)\n2. The enemy at (7, 0) is far away and poses no immediate threat\n3. After collecting, I'll have flexibility to move toward the top-row apples at (1, 9), (3, 9), or continue toward (9, 8)\n\n**Long-term plan:** Collect the apple at (5, 7) this turn, then reassess. After eating, I'll likely move to collect apples in the upper region (1, 9) or (3, 9) which cluster together, or potentially head right toward (9, 8).\n\nDOWN",
