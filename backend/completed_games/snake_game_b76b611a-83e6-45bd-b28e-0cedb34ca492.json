Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Short-Term Plan:\n- **Avoid corner traps:** Starting in a corner limits options to 2 moves (DOWN or RIGHT here). I should prioritize breaking out of the corner to maximize future flexibility.\n- **RIGHT (x+1) is better:** Moving RIGHT opens up more potential paths toward apples (e.g., (6,6), (6,2), (6,3)) while also allowing me to eventually move DOWN toward (3,3) or (3,7) if needed. DOWN would keep me stuck in the left column, which is less strategic.\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is at (2,6). If I move RIGHT to (1,9), it won\u2019t interfere with me yet, but I should avoid moving directly toward it unless necessary. The apple at (6,6) is the closest to both snakes, but I can reach it faster via RIGHT + UP.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:\n- **Goal:** Reach the apple at (6,6) first, as it\u2019s the most central and valuable for long-term growth.\n- **Path Preference:** RIGHT + UP + RIGHT + UP + RIGHT + UP (to (6,9) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (6,6)) is a strong candidate, but I should also consider LEFT + UP + RIGHT + UP + RIGHT + UP if RIGHT becomes risky later.\n- **Watch Enemy:** Snake #0 is moving toward (6,6) as well. If it takes a path that blocks mine, I\u2019ll need to pivot toward (3,3) or (3,7).\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** Never let my snake get trapped in a single path (e.g., moving DOWN too early could limit options).\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**RIGHT**",

If it moves **DOWN** to **(3, 6)**, it would be invalid (already occupies that cell). If it moves **RIGHT** to **(4, 7)** or **LEFT** to **(2, 7)**, it could threaten me.\n- If I move **DOWN** to **(2, 7)**, the enemy could move **LEFT** to **(2, 7)**, causing a head-on collision.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to **(3, 8)** is safe and keeps me away from the enemy's current position.\n\n**Apple Accessibility:**\n- The closest apple is **(3, 3)** (distance: ~3 moves if I go **DOWN** twice and then **LEFT**).\n- **(6, 6)** is farther but may be contested by the enemy.\n- **(0, 7)** is reachable if I move **LEFT** to **(1, 8)**, then **UP** to **(1, 7)**, and finally **LEFT** to **(0, 7)**.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n- Snake #0 is likely to move toward **(6, 6)** or **(3, 3)**. If it moves toward **(6, 6)**, I should prioritize **(3, 3)** or **(3, 7)**.\n- If it moves toward **(3, 3)**, I should pivot to **(6, 6)** or **(6, 2)**.\n\n---\n\n### Short-Term Plan:\n1. **Avoid immediate collision risk** with the enemy at **(3, 7)**. Moving **DOWN** to **(2, 7)** is risky because the enemy could move **LEFT** to **(2, 7)**.\n2. **Expand movement options** by moving **RIGHT** to **(3, 8)**. This keeps me safe and allows me to pivot toward **(3, 3)** or **(6, 6)** in future turns.\n3. **Prioritize reaching (3, 3)** first** as it is the closest apple and less likely to be contested by the enemy in the short term.\n   - From **(3, 8)**, I can move **DOWN** to **(3, 7)** (but this is adjacent to the enemy's head, so I need to be cautious).\n   - Alternatively, I can move **DOWN** to **(3, 7)** only if the enemy does not move into **(2, 7)** or **(4, 7)**.\n   - If the enemy moves toward **(6, 6)**, I can pivot to **(3, 3)** or **(3, 7)**.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note to Future Self:\n- **Goal:** Reach **(3, 3)** first. If the enemy moves toward **(6, 6)**, pivot to **(3, 3)** or **(3, 7)**.\n- **Path Preference:**\n  - If I move **RIGHT** to **(3, 8)**, I can then move **DOWN** to **(3, 7)** (if safe) or pivot to **(6, 6)** if the enemy moves toward **(3, 3)**.\n  - If I move **DOWN** to **(2, 7)**, I risk being too close to the enemy at **(3, 7)**. Avoid this unless the enemy moves away.\n- **Avoid Dead-Ends:** Never let my snake get trapped in a single row or column without escape routes.\n- **Watch Enemy:** If Snake #0 moves toward **(6, 6)**, prioritize **(3, 3)**. If it moves toward **(3, 3)**, pivot to **(6, 6)** or **(6, 2)**.\n- **Flexibility:** Moving **RIGHT** to **(3, 8)** allows me to pivot toward **(3, 3)** or **(6, 6)** depending on enemy movement.\n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n**DOWN** to **(2, 7)** is risky due to potential enemy collision.\n**RIGHT** to **(3, 8)** is safe but does not immediately progress toward an apple.\n**UP** to **(2, 9)** is safe but moves away from apples.\n**LEFT** to **(1, 8)** is safe but moves away from apples and does not expand options.\n\n**Best move:** **DOWN** to **(2, 7)** is the only move that directly progresses toward an apple, but it carries a risk of collision. Given the enemy's current position and movement patterns, it is unlikely to move **LEFT** to **(2, 7)** in the same turn. I will take the risk to move closer to **(3, 3)**.\n\nDOWN",

The board shows Snake #0 at **(5, 7)** with body at **(4, 7)**, but the last move info says it was at **(3, 7)** with body at **(3, 6)**. This discrepancy suggests the enemy moved **UP** from **(3, 7)** to **(5, 7)** is impossible in one move. I must rely on the current board state for accuracy.)\n  - Current board shows Snake #0 at **(5, 7)** with body at **(4, 7)**. This implies it moved **UP** from **(4, 7)** to **(5, 7)** (but this contradicts the last move info).

Wait, no: Snake #0's body is at (4, 7), so (3, 7) is empty. But (3, 7) is adjacent to (4, 7), but not occupied. So RIGHT to (3, 7) is valid unless the enemy moves into it this turn. However, the enemy is at (5, 7) with body at (4, 7). It cannot move to (3, 7) in one turn (it would have to move DOWN from (5, 7) to (5, 6) or LEFT to (4, 7), but (4, 7) is already occupied by its body. So RIGHT to (3, 7) is safe unless the enemy moves into it, which it cannot this turn. So RIGHT is valid.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Enemy snake is at (5, 7) with body at (4, 7).

It could move:\n  - **LEFT** to (5, 6) \u2192 Threatens me if I move **DOWN** to (3, 5) or stay at (3, 6) while it moves **LEFT**.\n  - **DOWN** to (6, 5) \u2192 No immediate threat to me at (3, 6).\n  - **UP** to (7, 6) \u2192 Out of bounds (invalid).\n  - **RIGHT** to (7, 6) \u2192 Out of bounds (invalid).\n- The enemy snake is likely to move toward apples at (6, 2), (6, 3), or (3, 3). Given its current position, it is most likely to move **LEFT** to (5, 6) to progress toward (6, 2) or (6, 3).\n\n---\n\n### Apple Accessibility:\n- Closest apple is **(3, 3)** (distance: **DOWN** once to (3, 5) and then **LEFT** twice to reach (3, 3)).\n- (6, 2) and (6, 3) are also close (~2 moves if I go **LEFT** twice and **DOWN** once).\n- (0, 7) and (2, 2) are far and not a priority yet.\n\n---\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction:\n- Snake #0 is currently at (6, 6) and is likely to move **LEFT** to (5, 6) to reach apples at (6, 2) or (6, 3) in the future.\n- If I move **DOWN** to (3, 5), I am one step closer to (3, 3) but risk being threatened by the enemy moving to (5, 6) next turn.\n- If I move **LEFT** to (2, 6), I am closer to (6, 2) or (6, 3) but still need two more moves to reach them.\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (4, 6), I am expanding my options to reach (6, 2) or (6, 3) in the future.\n\n---\n\n### Short-Term Plan:\n1. **Avoid immediate collision risk**: No immediate threats from the enemy's current position, but moving **DOWN** to (3, 5) could put me in a risky position if the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 6) next turn.\n2. **Progress toward (3, 3)**: Moving **DOWN** to (3, 5) is a step toward (3, 3).\n3. **Expand options**: Moving **LEFT** to (2, 6) allows me to reach (6, 2) or (6, 3) in two moves.\n4. **Prioritize (3, 3)**: It is the closest apple and less likely to be contested immediately.\n5. **Alternative path**: Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 6) is safe and allows me to pivot toward (6, 2) or (6, 3) if needed.\n6. **Avoid dead-ends**: Moving **UP** to (3, 7) does not immediately progress toward an apple.\n\n**Best move:**\n- **DOWN** to (3, 5) is the best move to progress toward (3, 3) while keeping options open to reach other apples like (6, 2) or (6, 3). However, I need to be cautious about the enemy's potential move next turn.\n- **LEFT** to (2, 6) is also a good move to progress toward (6, 2) or (6, 3) while avoiding potential threats from the enemy's move.\n\nGiven the enemy's likely move to (5, 6), **LEFT** to (2, 6) is safer and still moves me closer to apples.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Goal**: Reach (3, 3) or (6, 2)/(6, 3) as soon as possible.\n- **Avoid**: Moving into a position that could be contested by the enemy snake.\n- **Watch**: Enemy snake's movement toward apples, especially (6, 2), (6, 3), and (3, 3).\n- **Flexibility**: Keep multiple safe paths open to pivot if needed. Consider moving **LEFT** to (2, 6) and then **DOWN** to (2, 5) to avoid potential threats.\n\nLEFT",

Let me correct this.)\n\n**Correction on Enemy Snake's Position:**\nFrom the last move info, my snake moved **DOWN** from (2, 6) to (2, 5) on Turn 27.\nThe enemy snake's head was at **(3, 6)** on Turn 27, and its body included (4, 6), (4, 7), etc.\nIf the enemy snake moved **UP** from (3, 6) to (3, 7), it would be invalid because (3, 7) is occupied by its own body (from Turn 27's body list: (4, 7) is its body, but (3, 7) is not).\nIf the enemy snake moved **DOWN** from (3, 6) to (3, 5), this would be valid and safe (since (3, 5) is empty).\nIf the enemy snake moved **LEFT** from (3, 6) to (2, 6), this would be invalid (occupied by my snake's body).\nIf the enemy snake moved **RIGHT** from (3, 6) to (4, 6), this would be invalid (occupied by its own body).\n\nGiven this, the most likely move for the enemy snake on Turn 27 was **DOWN** to (3, 5).\nThus, the enemy snake's current position is:\n- **Head: (3, 5)**, **Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5)]** (assuming it moved **DOWN** to (3, 5) and its tail is now at (8, 5)).\n\n---\n\n### Safe Moves from (2, 5):\n1. **UP (y+1):** (2, 6) \u2192 **Invalid** (occupied by my own body).\n2. **DOWN (y-1):** (2, 4) \u2192 Valid (no immediate threats).\n3. **LEFT (x-1):** (1, 5) \u2192 Valid (no immediate threats).\n4. **RIGHT (x+1):** (3, 5) \u2192 **Invalid** (occupied by enemy snake's head).\n\n---\n\n### Threats:\n- The enemy snake's head is at **(3, 5)** and its body occupies (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5).\n- Possible enemy moves from (3, 5):\n  - **UP** to (3, 6) \u2192 **Invalid** (occupied by its own body).\n  - **DOWN** to (3, 4) \u2192 Valid and safe.\n  - **LEFT** to (2, 5) \u2192 **Invalid** (occupied by my head).\n  - **RIGHT** to (4, 5) \u2192 Valid and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Apple Accessibility:\n- The closest apple is at **(3, 3)**. It is 2 moves away if I go **RIGHT** twice (from (2, 5) to (3, 5) to (3, 3), but (3, 5) is occupied by the enemy snake's head).\n- The apple at **(0, 0)** is far away but might be reachable if I move **LEFT** and **DOWN** multiple times.\n- Other apples are even farther away.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n- **DOWN** to (2, 4) is a safe move that keeps me away from the enemy snake's head and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n- **LEFT** to (1, 5) is also a safe move, but it might not be as strategic as **DOWN** in terms of maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nGiven the enemy snake's current position and potential moves, **DOWN** to (2, 4) is the safest and most strategic move to avoid immediate threats and keep options open.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Goal**: Maintain safe distance from the enemy snake while positioning myself to collect apples at (3, 3) or other reachable locations.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - If I move **DOWN** to (2, 4), my new body will be: [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n  - Evaluate the next move from (2, 4) to ensure continued safety and apple collection.\n  - Avoid getting trapped in corners or dead-ends. The enemy snake is currently at (3, 5) and might move **DOWN** to (3, 4) or **RIGHT** to (4, 5) on the next turn.\n  - If the enemy snake moves **DOWN** to (3, 4), I should avoid moving to (3, 4) or (3, 5) in the future.\n  - If the enemy snake moves **RIGHT** to (4, 5), I should consider moving **LEFT** to (1, 5) or **DOWN** to (2, 4) to avoid future threats.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

It is 2 moves away if I go **RIGHT** twice (from (2, 4) to (3, 4) to (3, 3)).\n- The apple at **(0, 0)** is far away but might be reachable if I move **LEFT** and **DOWN** multiple times.\n- Other apples are even farther away.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move:\n- **RIGHT** to (3, 4) is a strategic move that positions me closer to the apple at (3, 3) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n- **DOWN** to (2, 3) is also a safe move, but it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n- **LEFT** to (1, 4) is safe but doesn't contribute to apple collection.\n\nGiven the enemy snake's current position and potential moves, **RIGHT** to (3, 4) is the best move to position myself for future apple collection while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Goal**: Position myself to collect the apple at (3, 3) on the next turn.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - If I move **RIGHT** to (3, 4), my new body will be: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n  - On the next turn, I can move **LEFT** to (3, 3) to collect the apple.\n  - Avoid getting trapped in corners or dead-ends. The enemy snake is currently at (3, 5) and might move **DOWN** to (3, 4) or **RIGHT** to (4, 5) on the next turn.\n  - If the enemy snake moves **DOWN** to (3, 4), I should avoid moving to (3, 4) in the future.\n  - If the enemy snake moves **RIGHT** to (4, 5), I should consider moving **LEFT** to (2, 4) or **DOWN** to (3, 3) to avoid future threats.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",
