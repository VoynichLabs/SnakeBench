Snake #0 is at (0, 3), so it can move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to (0, 4), (0, 2), (-1, 3), or (1, 3). None of these overlap with where my head can land on this turn, so **no head-on risk this turn**.\n\nAmong UP, LEFT, and RIGHT, I want to move toward reachable apples and maximize future options. Let me estimate reachability of apples:\n- (2, 1): Manhattan distance 4 + 1 = 5\n- (9, 4): Manhattan distance 2 + 4 = 6\n- (5, 4): Manhattan distance 2 + 4 = 6\n- (2, 0): Manhattan distance 5 + 0 = 5\n- (0, 4): Manhattan distance 7 + 4 = 11 (farthest)\n\nThe closer apples are at (2, 1) and (2, 0). Moving LEFT brings me closer to both, while UP only slightly reduces the distance and RIGHT moves away. LEFT also keeps me in the center-left region with plenty of open space, avoiding the right-edge trap near (9, 4).\n\nSo among safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), LEFT appears best: it reduces distance to the two nearest apples and maintains good future mobility.\n\n## END LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

I need to consider potential head-on collisions with snake #0. From (0, 4), snake #0 could move:\n- UP \u2192 (0, 5)\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 3) - but this is its own body segment\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 4) - off the board, so snake #0 won't choose this\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4)\n\nNone of these positions overlap with my potential landing spots of (6, 1), (5, 0), or (7, 0). So **no head-on collision risk this turn**.\n\nNow let me consider which move brings me closer to apples:\n- (2, 1): Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |0-1| = 5 from current position\n  - From (6, 1): |6-2| + |1-1| = 4 \u2713\n  - From (5, 0): |5-2| + |0-1| = 4 \u2713\n  - From (7, 0): |7-2| + |0-1| = 6\n- (2, 0): Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |0-0| = 4 from current position\n  - From (6, 1): |6-2| + |1-0| = 5\n  - From (5, 0): |5-2| + |0-0| = 3 \u2713\n  - From (7, 0): |7-2| + |0-0| = 5\n- (5, 4): Manhattan distance = |6-5| + |0-4| = 5 from current position\n  - From (6, 1): |6-5| + |1-4| = 4 \u2713\n  - From (5, 0): |5-5| + |0-4| = 4 \u2713\n  - From (7, 0): |7-5| + |0-4| = 6\n\nBoth UP and LEFT put me at distance 4 from (2, 1), but LEFT puts me closer to (2, 0) (distance 3 vs 5). LEFT also gives me more future mobility by keeping me in the center of the board rather than moving toward the bottom edge.\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Continue moving toward the cluster of apples at (2, 1) and (2, 0), while monitoring snake #0's movements.

Normally moving into your own tail is deadly, but in Snake, the tail moves forward after the head moves unless you eat an apple. Since I am NOT eating an apple this turn, my tail will move from (0,3) to ??? Actually, my body is [(0,4),(0,3)] after last turn\u2019s growth? Wait, check: Last turn I moved from (0,3) to (0,4) and ate apple. So after growth, my body is now: head (0,4), tail (0,3). This turn, if I don\u2019t eat apple, tail moves forward to where? The movement logic: head moves first, then each body segment moves into the previous segment\u2019s old position. So if I move UP to (0,5), my head goes to (0,5), segment at (0,4) moves to old head\u2019s position? Actually, the body follows: the old head position becomes new body segment 1, old body segment 1 moves to old body segment 2\u2019s position, but since length is 2, tail disappears from (0,3) and new tail is at (0,4). So after moving without eating: head at new position, body segment at old head position (0,4), tail gone from (0,3). That means (0,3) becomes empty. So moving DOWN to (0,3) is safe because tail will vacate it before collision check? No \u2014 collision check is simultaneous: you check if head moves into a cell occupied by any snake\u2019s body at the start of the turn. At start of turn, (0,3) is my tail, so moving DOWN into (0,3) would be moving into my own body \u2192 death. So DOWN is not safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,4) \u2014 off board, invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,4) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (6,0) could move LEFT to (5,0), UP to (6,1), RIGHT to (7,0), DOWN invalid (off board). Nearest apples to enemy: (2,0) and (2,1). Enemy likely moves LEFT/UP. Not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to me: (2,1) is 2 steps right, 3 steps down from (0,4). (5,4) is 5 steps right, 0 steps vertically. (9,4) far right. (8,8) far.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,4), I\u2019m closer to (5,4) and (2,1).  \nIf I go UP to (0,5), I\u2019m moving away from most apples except maybe (8,8) long term.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (1,4) next turn: can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT back to (0,4) (which will be empty after tail moves).  \nFrom (0,5) next turn: can go UP, RIGHT, DOWN (back to (0,4) empty), LEFT off board.  \n\nBoth keep options open, but RIGHT seems better for apple proximity.  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (6,0) can\u2019t reach (1,4) or (0,5) in one move, so no head-on possible this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1,4), next turn I can aim for (2,4) then (5,4) apple, or go down toward (2,1). Need to watch enemy\u2019s path to (2,0)/(2,1) \u2014 they might compete for that apple.  \n\nGiven my score lead (1 vs 0), I can play safe and go toward apples while avoiding risky narrow paths later.  \n\n**Choice:**  \nRIGHT gets me closer to apples and keeps multiple exits.  \n\nRIGHT",

Not an immediate threat to my position at (2,4) or (1,3).  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nI want to collect (2,1) or (5,4) soon.  \nGoing RIGHT to (2,4) sets up: next turn I could go DOWN to (2,3) then (2,2) then (2,1) for apple, or go RIGHT toward (5,4).  \nGoing DOWN to (1,3) sets up: next turn go RIGHT to (2,3) then down to (2,2) then (2,1).  \n\nBoth are fine, but RIGHT to (2,4) also keeps (5,4) in reach and avoids being too low near enemy's possible path to (2,0).  \n\n**Choice:**  \nRIGHT seems slightly better \u2014 it keeps more space above and below, and I can still go down later toward (2,1).  \n\nRIGHT",

Neither overlaps with my possible moves (DOWN to (2,2), LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3)). So no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nFrom (2,3):\n- (2,1) is 2 steps DOWN.\n- (2,0) is 3 steps DOWN.\n- (5,4) is 3 steps RIGHT + 1 UP.\n- (9,4) far.\n- (8,8) far.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (2,1) to eat apple, but enemy might also reach (2,1) next turn if they go LEFT to (3,1) then DOWN to (3,2)? Wait, (2,1) from enemy at (4,1): quickest path is LEFT to (3,1), LEFT to (2,1) in 2 turns, or LEFT+DOWN in 2 turns. Actually, from (4,1) to (2,1) is 2 steps min (LEFT twice). So they could be at (2,1) in 2 turns. If I go DOWN to (2,2), next turn I can go DOWN to (2,1) and eat apple before enemy if they take 2 turns. But if enemy moves LEFT this turn to (3,1), then next turn they could move LEFT to (2,1) same time as me moving DOWN to (2,1) \u2192 head-on collision at (2,1) next turn.

If I go LEFT to (1,2) or RIGHT to (3,2) instead, I avoid collision but lose apple.\n\nMaybe safer to go for (5,4) instead.  \nFrom (2,3), going RIGHT to (3,3) moves toward (5,4). Enemy is far from (5,4) right now (distance |4-5| + |1-4| = 1+3=4 steps). Less competition.\n\n**Future options:**\n- DOWN to (2,2): then can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is body? tail will move, so UP might be safe next turn depending on tail movement).

Both UP and LEFT would work, but RIGHT is strategically best for apple acquisition.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2, 1), my next move should likely be RIGHT again to (3, 1), then DOWN to (3, 2).

However, RIGHT keeps me more central and is more directly aligned with the path to (4, 2), the closest apple. I also need to consider that snake #0 is at (4, 5) and might also be interested in nearby apples, so getting to (4, 2) quickly could be important.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3, 1), my next move should be RIGHT again to (4, 1), then UP to (4, 2) to collect the closest apple. I need to monitor snake #0's position carefully - they're at (4, 5) with 3 apples and might move toward (5, 0), (0, 5), or (4, 2). If they head toward (4, 2) as well, I may need to pivot to a different apple like (5, 0) or (0, 5). After collecting (4, 2), I should consider (5, 0) or (0, 5) as next targets depending on positioning.

Their possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (1, 6)\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4)\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5): apple location!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5): their own body - not valid\n\nMy potential positions (4, 3), (4, 1), (5, 2) don't overlap with snake #0's possible moves (1, 6), (1, 4), or (0, 5). No risk of head-on collision.\n\n**Strategic evaluation of safe moves:**\nAll three moves UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe. Now considering value:\n\n1. RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2): Moves toward the apple at (5, 0) - 2 moves away, good progress\n2. UP \u2192 (4, 3): Moves toward center, maintains flexibility\n3. DOWN \u2192 (4, 1): Moves away from most apples and toward edge\n\n**Future mobility analysis:**\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2): Will have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available (LEFT goes back to (4, 2) which will be occupied by my body)\n- UP \u2192 (4, 3): Will have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT available\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1): Will have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT available\n\nRIGHT is optimal - it positions me to reach the apple at (5, 0) in 2 moves (RIGHT then DOWN), while maintaining good future mobility. This continues my path toward increasing my apple lead over snake #0.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**\nFrom (5, 2), I should continue RIGHT to (5, 1) then DOWN to (5, 0) to collect that apple. Snake #0 moving to (0, 5) gives them an apple but puts them far away from me, reducing collision risk. After (5, 0), I should target (8, 6) or (8, 8) as the next closest apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (4,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2) \u2013 its own body (neck), unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2) \u2013 empty.  \n\nEnemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:  \nEnemy cannot reach (1,6), (1,4), or (0,5) in one move. No immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (0,5) \u2013 1 step left from (1,5).  \n- (5,0) \u2013 5 steps away.  \n- (8,6) \u2013 7 steps away.  \n\nLEFT directly eats (0,5) apple this turn. That gives me length 5, enemy length 4, and I lead 4 apples to 3.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \n- UP to (1,6): next turn can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all likely safe).  \n- DOWN to (1,4): next turn can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP back to (1,5) will be empty).  \n- LEFT to (0,5): eat apple, grow next turn. Next turn head at (0,5), possible moves: UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), RIGHT (1,5) \u2013 but (1,5) will be empty because body moved? Wait: after eating apple, tail stays, so body segments: new head at (0,5), old head (1,5) becomes body, old neck (2,5) stays body, old tail (4,5) stays tail. So (1,5) is occupied by my own body next turn. So from (0,5) next turn, UP, DOWN, RIGHT (into 1,5) is unsafe, LEFT off board. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn if I go LEFT now. That\u2019s risky \u2014 reduces future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of going LEFT now:**  \nGoing LEFT eats apple but traps me at (0,5) with only UP/DOWN next turn. That\u2019s a potential dead end if enemy approaches.  \n\nEnemy at (4,2) could move toward (5,0) apple or (8,6). They\u2019re not close to (0,5) immediately, but being stuck at left edge with only 2 moves is dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative: go UP or DOWN to keep flexibility:**  \nUP to (1,6): next turn I can still reach (0,5) in two moves (LEFT then DOWN) if needed, but also have more space.  \nDOWN to (1,4): moves toward center, more options.  \n\nGiven enemy length same as mine now, I should avoid trapping myself. Eating apple now with LEFT is tempting but could backfire if enemy cuts off my escape.  \n\nBetter to stay flexible, keep distance from enemy, and aim to eat apple later when safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP to (1,6) to stay in open area, then reassess. From (1,6) I can go LEFT to (0,6) then DOWN to (0,5) to eat apple in two turns if enemy isn\u2019t threatening. This keeps more options open.  \n\nUP",

If enemy goes UP to (6, 3), they\u2019ll be closer to center.  \nI want to avoid being trapped near enemy while collecting apples.  \n\nRIGHT to (5, 8) keeps me near apples (8, 8) and (8, 6), and also opens possibility to go DOWN later toward (5, 4) if safe.  \nFrom (5, 8), I can go DOWN next turn to (5, 7) \u2192 toward (5, 4) in 2 more steps.  \n\nDOWN now to (4, 7) also moves toward (5, 4) but puts me farther from (8, 8) and (8, 6).  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s position, moving DOWN might bring me closer to enemy\u2019s potential path upward, but still safe for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT seems best:  \n- Moves toward multiple apples (8, 8), (8, 6), (9, 4).  \n- Keeps 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Avoids moving into enemy\u2019s likely upward path.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 8), consider DOWN toward (5, 4) if safe, else continue RIGHT toward apples. Monitor enemy\u2019s movement toward center.  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes, because head moves to (8, 8), body is [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)], so LEFT (7, 8) is body, unsafe.

(9, 4) is far for them. They might go UP to (5, 5) or LEFT to (4, 4).  \n\nEating apple now is good to close gap.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets apple, keeps future options open, no immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8, 8), consider DOWN to (8, 7) to approach (8, 6) apple, or RIGHT to (9, 8) to stay near top-right area.

Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (4,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) \u2013 its own body, unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) \u2013 empty.  \n\nEnemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nHead-on collision risk:  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,6), enemy cannot reach it in 1 move.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7,7), enemy cannot reach it in 1 move.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,7), enemy cannot reach it in 1 move.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (8,6) directly below me. Eating it would make me length 6 (tie enemy length).  \nOther apples: (5,9) is 5 steps away, (9,4) is 5 steps away, (2,4) and (0,5) far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each option:**  \n- DOWN to (8,6): eat apple, grow to length 6. Next turn from (8,6): body at (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8). Possible moves: UP (8,7) body, DOWN (8,5) empty, LEFT (7,6) empty, RIGHT (9,6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. But eating apple means tail stays at (5,8) for now, so body blocks UP only.  \n- LEFT to (7,7): next turn from (7,7): body at (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8). Possible moves: UP (7,8) body, DOWN (7,6) empty, LEFT (6,7) empty, RIGHT (8,7) body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (9,7): next turn from (9,7): body at (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8). Possible moves: UP (9,8) empty, DOWN (9,6) empty, LEFT (8,7) body, RIGHT off board \u2192 2 safe moves (edge).  \n\nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and gets apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy might go UP toward (5,9) apple, or LEFT toward (2,4) apple. From (4,5), (5,9) is 5 steps, (2,4) is 3 steps. Likely enemy goes LEFT to (3,5) or UP to (4,6). Either way, not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEat (8,6) now to tie length with enemy. After eating, from (8,6) I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. I should avoid trapping myself near edges. Next turn after eating, consider moving toward center (LEFT to (7,6)) to keep options open, unless enemy is close.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gets apple, keeps most future options, no immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,6), avoid going UP into body. Prefer DOWN or LEFT to stay safe and move toward center. Watch enemy\u2019s position for possible collisions.  \n\nDOWN",

From there, apples at (5, 9), (8, 6), and (9, 4) become more accessible.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 5)**: Moves me toward the center and positions me to potentially reach various apples in the upper-right quadrant. The apple at (9, 4) would be 5 units away from (5, 5).\n- **LEFT to (3, 5)**: Moves me away from most apples and toward the left edge. The apple at (2, 4) is closest but not particularly intriguing compared to the cluster in the upper-right and center.\n\n**Distance analysis from my current position (4, 5):**\n- To (5, 9): 5 units\n- To (8, 6): 4 units\n- To (9, 4): 5 units\n- To (2, 4): 3 units\n- To (0, 5): 5 units\n\n**Future flexibility:**\n- From (4, 6): I'll maintain height advantage and can potentially move LEFT/RIGHT in future turns\n- From (5, 5): Good central positioning with options in all directions\n- From (3, 5): Limited options, away from the main action\n\n**Competition with snake #0:**\nSnake #0's new head position at (8, 7) is well-positioned to grab (8, 6) very quickly. I need to maintain upward momentum to compete for (5, 9) while snake #0 is likely targeting (8, 6).\n\n**Optimal choice:**\nUP continues to be the best choice. Building upward momentum will allow me to better compete for the apples in the top half of the board and maintain proximity to multiple apples as my tail continues to clear.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**\nContinue upward momentum toward the apple cluster. Monitor snake #0's position at (8, 7) - it's positioned to take (8, 6) soon. Consider a rightward turn in 1-2 moves once my body segment at (4, 4) clears to position myself for (5, 9) or intercept other apples in the upper-right quadrant.\n\nUP",

From (5,6), (5,9) is 3 steps, (2,4) is 5 steps. Could also go RIGHT toward center. Not an immediate threat to me.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want to stay safe and go for nearest apple (9,4). To do that, I could go RIGHT now, but that reduces future safe moves. Better to go DOWN to (8,4), then next turn go RIGHT to (9,4) to eat apple, while keeping options open.  \nGoing LEFT moves me away from (9,4) but toward center and other apples later.\n\nGiven enemy length ties mine, I should avoid risky edge moves unless necessary. DOWN seems safest now, keeps apple path open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,4), consider RIGHT to (9,4) to eat apple, but check enemy position first. If enemy is close to (9,4), maybe avoid and go for (5,9) instead via LEFT later.\n\nDOWN",

Less optimal when food is so close.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (6, 8)**: Also avoids the apple, takes me away from immediate points.\n\n**Future flexibility after eating (5, 9):**\n- My new head will be at (5, 9), having just eaten\n- I'll have 6 segments total\n- From (5, 9), I can consider moving toward other apples like (0, 9) or (6, 6)\n- The enemy snake at (9, 4) is far away and can't interfere\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nSnake #0 is currently winning with 6 apples. Eating the apple at (5, 9) will tie the score at 6-6, putting us back on equal footing.\n\n**Optimal choice:**\nUP is the clear winner - it's safe, immediately beneficial, helps me catch up to the enemy, and positions me well for future turns.\n\n**Strategy note for next turns:** After eating (5, 9), I'll be at 6 apples tied with the enemy. Consider targeting (0, 9) next - it's the farthest apple from enemy snake #0 (at 9, 4), giving me a good chance to claim it. Watch out for potential head-on collisions if the enemy also targets the same apple.\n\nUP",

(6, 6) is the most reachable apple from center-left. Enemy at (4, 9) might go for (6, 6) too, but they\u2019re far. If we go LEFT now, we can go UP next to (8, 3) and then toward (6, 6) while keeping options open.

Moving UP from (7, 2) gets me to (7, 3), closer in y-direction to (6, 6).  \nLEFT to (6, 2) also reduces x-distance to 0, but y-distance is still 4.  \nDOWN to (7, 1) increases y-distance to 5.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (7, 3):**  \nBody becomes: head (7, 3), then (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), tail (8, 6).  \nFrom (7, 3):  \n- UP (7, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (7, 2) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn. Good.\n\n**DOWN to (7, 1):**  \nBody: head (7, 1), then (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), tail (8, 6).  \nFrom (7, 1):  \n- UP (7, 2) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (7, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8, 1) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn. But moves me away from apples.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 2):**  \nBody: head (6, 2), then (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), tail (8, 6).  \nFrom (6, 2):  \n- UP (6, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (6, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (5, 2) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (7, 2) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn. Gets me closer to (6, 6) in x-direction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nUP and LEFT both keep options open. UP is slightly better for apple (6, 6) because it reduces y-distance by 1 and keeps x-distance 1.  \nLEFT reduces x-distance to 0 but y-distance stays 4, meaning I\u2019ll need 4 moves upward later, possibly getting boxed in by my own body if I\u2019m not careful.  \nUP now gives me more central position and flexibility to go LEFT/UP next turn toward apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7, 3), consider moving UP or LEFT toward (6, 6) depending on safety. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s movement toward (0, 9) or (2, 4) \u2014 they\u2019re far away for now.\n\nUP",

Possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 apple, empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 its own body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 empty.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, RIGHT.  \nManhattan distance from enemy (2,5) to me (9,8) = 7 + 3 = 10 \u2192 no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples: (9,9), (4,0), (2,1), (2,6), (1,1).  \nFrom (9,8):  \n- (9,9) distance 1 (UP)  \n- (2,6) distance 10  \n- Others farther.  \n\nClosest is (9,9) \u2014 requires UP.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (9,9) \u2013 eat apple, grow by 1.**  \nNew body: head (9,9), then (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2) \u2014 wait, need to check length: currently 10 segments (head + 9 body). After eating apple, length becomes 11 segments. So tail stays where it was (8,2) this turn, but next turn tail moves forward one cell (since we grew, tail doesn\u2019t move this turn? Actually in Snake, after eating, you grow at the end of the turn, so tail stays in place for this turn, then next turn tail doesn\u2019t move \u2014 but here the game likely grows immediately, meaning the tail stays at (8,2) until next move? Let\u2019s clarify: In this game, \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" That means after moving to apple, new segment is added at the tail position before moving? Or at the head? Usually it's added at tail end after movement, so tail doesn\u2019t move that turn. So next turn, tail will still be at (8,2) when we move from (9,9).  \n\nFrom (9,9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nOnly 1 safe move: LEFT to (8,9). That\u2019s risky \u2014 cornered with only one exit.  \n\n**DOWN to (9,7) \u2013 no apple.**  \nBody: head (9,7), then (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (8,2).  \nFrom (9,7) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 my body (fourth segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nOnly 1 safe move: DOWN to (9,6). Also risky.  \n\nBoth UP and DOWN lead to only one safe move next turn, but UP gives us an apple and the lead (10 vs enemy 9), and we might survive if we can escape the corner next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves:**  \nEnemy might go UP to (2,6) to eat apple, or RIGHT to (3,5). If enemy goes UP, they\u2019ll be at (2,6) next to apple (2,6) \u2014 they\u2019ll eat it and grow. That ties apples again if we don\u2019t eat ours.  \n\nIf we go DOWN, we avoid corner but lose apple, enemy likely gets (2,6) apple \u2192 tie at 9 each, but we\u2019re in a slightly better position? Actually from (9,7) only DOWN safe, then from (9,6) maybe more options open.  \n\nBut going DOWN means we\u2019re stuck along right edge with limited exits for a couple turns.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gets apple and lead, but traps us in corner with only LEFT exit next turn. We must hope LEFT (8,9) is free next turn \u2014 it should be, since enemy is far away. Then from (8,9) we can go DOWN or LEFT to open space.  \n\nDOWN avoids corner but gives enemy chance to tie or pass us in apples soon.  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple and trust I can escape next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (9,9), next turn only LEFT to (8,9) is safe. Take it, then from (8,9) we\u2019ll have more options (DOWN to (8,8) will be empty then because body moves).  \n\nUP",

Let\u2019s check:\n- UP (3,7): empty.\n- DOWN (3,5): empty (enemy\u2019s body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), \u2026 so (3,5) free).\n- LEFT (2,6): enemy\u2019s own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (4,6): empty.\n\nSo enemy has 3 safe moves. Manhattan distance from (3,6) to (7,9) = 4+3=7, no immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after moving LEFT to (7,9):**\nFrom (7,9) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 empty (my body after move: head (7,9), then (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), \u2026 so (7,8) free).\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nSo next turn from (7,9) I\u2019d have DOWN and LEFT safe \u2014 better options.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan:**\nGoal: get off top row toward apples at bottom. From (7,9) \u2192 next turn go DOWN to (7,8) to open more space. Then from (7,8) I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT depending on body positions. Need to navigate toward (4,1) area while avoiding enemy (who is on left side). Enemy may go for (2,1) or (1,1) soon, so maybe aim for (4,1) or (3,1) via a safe path.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting:**\nApples are at y=0 and y=1. I\u2019m at y=9, so long way down. Need to move down gradually while keeping options open. Enemy is closer to those apples but may also be maneuvering around its own body.\n\nGiven only one legal move now, I must take LEFT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,9), go DOWN to (7,8) to leave top edge and open future moves. Then evaluate path toward apples while avoiding dead ends.\n\nLEFT",

Actually, my body currently is: (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), \u2026 so (7,8) is empty now. Yes, safe from my own body.

I should avoid moving into its path but currently far apart.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nLEFT gives better future mobility. DOWN traps me next turn with only one move.  \n\nSo choose **LEFT** to (6,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6,9), go DOWN to (6,8) to continue descending toward apples while keeping LEFT/UP/RIGHT options open.

No \u2014 last turn apples were at (4,0),(2,1),(1,1),(3,1),(4,1) and I was at (6,9) moving DOWN to (6,8) \u2014 that\u2019s not an apple. So length stayed 10. Let\u2019s recount: current body: head (6,8), then (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) \u2014 that\u2019s 11 segments. Did I eat an apple earlier? Yes, last turn info says \u201cApples collected: 10\u201d before move, now after move still 10? Wait, if I didn\u2019t eat, length stays same. But my body list in current state has 11 coordinates including head. That means I must have eaten an apple last turn \u2014 but apple locations didn\u2019t change? Let\u2019s check board: apple at (4,0),(2,1),(1,1),(3,1),(4,1). (6,8) is not an apple. So why 11 segments? Let\u2019s check: maybe I\u2019m misreading. The \u201cYour snake\u201d body list given now is: [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)] \u2014 that\u2019s 10 segments, plus head (6,8) makes 11 total. But I started with 10 apples, length 10 segments before last move. If I didn\u2019t eat, length stays 10 after move (head moves, tail moves). But here tail is (6,6) \u2014 that\u2019s new tail after moving from (6,5)? Wait, last turn my tail was (6,5) after shift? Let\u2019s trace: last turn my body before move: [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)] \u2014 that\u2019s 10 segments, head at (6,9). I moved DOWN to (6,8). New head (6,8), add old head (6,9) as second, drop last segment (6,6) becomes tail? No \u2014 dropping last segment would remove (6,6), but in new list (6,6) is still there as last segment. That means I didn\u2019t drop tail \u2014 so I grew. That means I ate an apple last turn. But apple list unchanged? Possibly apple at (6,8) was not listed? Let\u2019s check board: at y=8 x=6 is \u20180\u2019 (my head), no apple. So contradiction. Possibly the \u201cApples collected: 10\u201d is after last move, and an apple was at (6,8) and got eaten and removed from list. Yes \u2014 that must be it: apple at (6,8) was there last turn but not shown in current apple list because it was eaten. That explains length 11 now.  \n\nSo current length 11.  \n\nNow check moves:  \nUP (6,9) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,7) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5,8) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (7,8) \u2192 my body segment 6? Let\u2019s list: head (6,8), seg2 (6,9), seg3 (7,9), seg4 (8,9), seg5 (9,9), seg6 (9,8), seg7 (8,8), seg8 (8,7), seg9 (7,7), seg10 (7,6), seg11 (6,6). So (7,8) not in my body. Actually (7,8) is empty. So RIGHT is safe too.  \n\nCheck enemy body: enemy body: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6)] plus head (3,3). So (6,7),(5,8),(7,8) not in enemy body.  \n\nSo all but UP are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (3,3). Possible moves:  \nUP (3,4) \u2192 its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (3,2) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (2,3) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (4,3) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nManhattan distance to my possible next positions:  \n- If I go DOWN (6,7): |6-3|+|7-3|=3+4=7.  \n- If I go LEFT (5,8): |5-3|+|8-3|=2+5=7.  \n- If I go RIGHT (7,8): |7-3|+|8-3|=4+5=9.  \n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn (distance >1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (6,7):**  \nNext turn options from (6,7):  \nUP (6,8) \u2192 my head now \u2014 wait, after move, body: seg2 (6,8), seg3 (6,9), seg4 (7,9), seg5 (8,9), seg6 (9,9), seg7 (9,8), seg8 (8,8), seg9 (8,7), seg10 (7,7), seg11 (7,6), tail (6,6).  \nSo (6,8) is my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,6) \u2192 my tail (seg11) \u2192 but tail moves when I move next turn? Actually tail at (6,6) will move only if I don\u2019t eat apple. If I move to (6,7) now, next turn tail at (6,6) will be gone if no growth. So (6,6) will be empty next turn. So DOWN safe next turn.  \nLEFT (5,7) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (7,7) \u2192 my body seg10 \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn safe: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (5,8):**  \nNext turn from (5,8):  \nUP (5,9) \u2192 my body seg3? After move, body: seg2 (6,8), seg3 (6,9), seg4 (7,9), seg5 (8,9), seg6 (9,9), seg7 (9,8), seg8 (8,8), seg9 (8,7), seg10 (7,7), seg11 (7,6), tail (6,6). So (5,9) empty. Actually (5,9) not in my body. So UP safe.  \nDOWN (5,7) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (4,8) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (6,8) \u2192 my body seg2 \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\n**RIGHT to (7,8):**  \nNext turn from (7,8):  \nUP (7,9) \u2192 my body seg4 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (7,7) \u2192 my body seg10 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6,8) \u2192 my body seg2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8,8) \u2192 my body seg8 \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo RIGHT leaves me with 0 safe moves next turn \u2014 deadly. So eliminate RIGHT.  \n\nSo safe now: DOWN, LEFT.  \nLEFT gives more options next turn (3 vs 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nApples at (4,0),(2,1),(1,1),(3,1),(4,1).  \nFrom (5,8) vs (6,7):  \nLEFT to (5,8) is farther from apples in y (distance 7 vs 6).  \nDOWN to (6,7) is closer in y.  \n\nBut LEFT gives more future flexibility.  \n\nEnemy at (3,3) will likely go DOWN/LEFT toward apples. If I go DOWN to (6,7), I\u2019m closer but still far right. Might cut across later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (5,8) gives 3 safe moves next turn, better survival.  \nDOWN to (6,7) gives only 2 safe moves but slightly closer to apples.  \n\nGiven scores tied at 10 apples each, survival is top priority. More options next turn means less chance of being trapped.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **LEFT** to keep flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,8), likely go DOWN or LEFT to descend toward apples while keeping distance from enemy. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if they go for (4,1) area, I might aim for (4,0) from right side later.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, enemy body: (3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(1,4),(1,5). Yes, (3,6) is enemy body segment 6 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (5,6) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly DOWN safe next turn \u2192 very risky.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,6):**  \nNext turn from (6,6):  \nUP (6,7) \u2192 my body segment 4? Wait, my body after moving: head (6,6), then (5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8),(8,8),(8,7). Actually (6,7) is not in my body (check: (5,7) yes, but (6,7) no). So (6,7) is safe.  \nDOWN (6,5) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5,6) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (7,6) \u2192 empty.  \nSo safe next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives only 1.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting & enemy path:**  \nApples: (4,0), (2,1), (1,1), (4,1), (9,7).  \nEnemy at (3,0) will likely go RIGHT to (4,0) to eat apple and grow, or LEFT to (2,0) to avoid immediate death (but (2,0) is empty, no apple). If enemy goes RIGHT, its new head at (4,0) will be near bottom left.  \n\nFrom my position (5,6):  \n- DOWN (5,5) moves toward lower apples (4,0) but enemy may be there next turn \u2014 careful.  \n- RIGHT (6,6) moves toward center/right, away from enemy\u2019s likely position, and toward apple at (9,7) eventually.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid future trap:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (5,5), next turn enemy could be at (4,0) or (4,1) if it ate and moved up. That\u2019s still 4\u20135 steps away. But going DOWN reduces my y, possibly boxing me near bottom if enemy moves up.  \nGoing RIGHT keeps me central with more space on right side (less enemy body there).  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s long body along x=3 and x=2 in mid rows, staying away from left side is safer.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives good future options and moves away from enemy\u2019s current area. DOWN also safe but heads toward where enemy will be after eating apple.  \nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT for safety and future flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6,6), consider moving toward apple (9,7) via safe path, but watch enemy\u2019s new head position after it eats apple at (4,0) or (2,0). Avoid getting close to enemy\u2019s possible upward movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** (6,5): Not in my body, not off board, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** (5,6): My body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe.  \n- **RIGHT** (7,6): Not in my body, not off board, not enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat this turn**  \nEnemy head: (4,0)  \nPossible enemy moves:  \nUP (4,1) \u2013 apple at (4,1), will eat and grow.  \nDOWN (4,-1) \u2013 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (3,0) \u2013 enemy body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (5,0) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (4,1), it eats apple, grows, and will be at (4,1) next turn.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5,0), no apple, stays length 13.  \n\nManhattan distance from enemy head to my possible next positions:  \n- My UP (6,7): |6-4|+|7-0| = 2+7=9  \n- My DOWN (6,5): |6-4|+|5-0| = 2+5=7  \n- My RIGHT (7,6): |7-4|+|6-0| = 3+6=9  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk (distance >1).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (6,7):**  \nNext turn from (6,7):  \nUP (6,8) \u2192 my body segment 4 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,6) \u2192 my body segment 1 (old head) will be at (6,6) after move? Wait, after moving UP, my body becomes: head (6,7), then (6,6),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9),(9,8),(8,8). So (6,6) is my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5,7) \u2192 my body segment 4 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (7,7) \u2192 empty.  \nOnly RIGHT safe next turn \u2192 risky.  \n\n**DOWN to (6,5):**  \nNext turn from (6,5):  \nUP (6,6) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,4) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5,5) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (7,5) \u2192 empty.  \nThree safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (7,6):**  \nNext turn from (7,6):  \nUP (7,7) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (7,5) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (6,6) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8,6) \u2192 empty.  \nThree safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn, UP gives only 1.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (2,1), (1,1), (4,1), (9,7), (0,2).  \nEnemy likely to eat (4,1) if it goes UP.  \nFrom my position:  \n- DOWN (6,5) moves toward bottom apples (4,1) but enemy will be there next turn if it goes UP.  \n- RIGHT (7,6) moves toward right side apple (9,7) eventually.  \n- UP (6,7) moves toward (9,7) but leaves me with only 1 safe move next turn \u2192 too risky.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy\u2019s possible path**  \nEnemy at (4,0) going UP to (4,1) will grow to length 14. Next turn it could go UP (4,2), LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1).  \nIf I go DOWN to (6,5), I\u2019m 2 steps away from (4,5) horizontally, not too close.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7,6), I\u2019m farther from enemy\u2019s area.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s long body along left side (x=3,2,1), staying right seems safer.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN and RIGHT both safe with good future options.  \nRIGHT moves toward apple (9,7) and away from enemy\u2019s current location.  \nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT for safety and future flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,6), consider moving UP toward (9,7) if safe, but check enemy\u2019s new head position after it likely eats (4,1). Avoid getting near enemy\u2019s body on left side.  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** (7,6): My body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe.  \n- **LEFT** (6,7): Not in my body, not off board, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** (8,7): Not in my body, not off board, not enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat this turn**  \nEnemy head: (4,2) (likely moved UP last turn to eat apple at (4,2), now length 15).  \nPossible enemy moves from (4,2):  \nUP (4,3) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (4,1) \u2013 enemy body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (3,2) \u2013 enemy body segment 5 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (5,2) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT.  \n\nManhattan distance from enemy head to my possible next positions:  \n- My UP (7,8): |7-4|+|8-2| = 3+6=9  \n- My LEFT (6,7): |6-4|+|7-2| = 2+5=7  \n- My RIGHT (8,7): |8-4|+|7-2| = 4+5=9  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk (distance >1).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (7,8):**  \nNext turn from (7,8):  \nUP (7,9) \u2013 my body segment 8 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (7,7) \u2013 my old head position, now body segment 2? Wait, after moving UP, my body becomes: head (7,8), then (7,7),(7,6),(6,6),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9). So (7,7) is body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (6,8) \u2013 my body segment 6 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (8,8) \u2013 empty.  \nOnly one safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s risky.  \n\n**LEFT to (6,7):**  \nNext turn from (6,7):  \nUP (6,8) \u2013 my body segment 6 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (6,6) \u2013 my body segment 3 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (5,7) \u2013 my body segment 4 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (7,7) \u2013 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nNo safe moves next turn! That\u2019s a death trap. So LEFT is actually unsafe in the 2-step lookahead.  \n\n**RIGHT to (8,7):**  \nNext turn from (8,7):  \nUP (8,8) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (8,6) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (7,7) \u2013 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (9,7) \u2013 apple at (9,7), but need to check if it\u2019s safe: not in my body, not enemy body.  \nSo three safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nThus, only RIGHT gives multiple safe moves next turn. UP gives only 1 safe move, LEFT gives 0 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (2,1), (1,1), (9,7), (0,2), (5,4).  \nRIGHT to (8,7) puts me adjacent to apple (9,7) for next turn.  \nUP to (7,8) moves away from (9,7) and into a corner with only 1 safe move next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy path**  \nEnemy at (4,2) can go UP or RIGHT. If it goes RIGHT to (5,2), it\u2019s still far from me. My RIGHT move keeps me far from enemy and near apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT is a death trap next turn. UP leaves me with only RIGHT next turn, which could be dangerous if enemy approaches.  \nRIGHT gives me 3 safe moves next turn and gets me next to apple (9,7) to eat next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,7), eat apple (9,7) if safe, but check enemy position first. Keep distance from enemy\u2019s long body on left side.  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat this turn**  \nEnemy head: (5,2)  \nPossible enemy moves from (5,2):  \nUP (5,3) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (5,1) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (4,2) \u2013 enemy body segment 1 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (6,2) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nManhattan distance from enemy head to my possible next positions:  \n- My UP (8,8): |8-5|+|8-2| = 3+6=9  \n- My DOWN (8,6): |8-5|+|6-2| = 3+4=7  \n- My RIGHT (9,7): |9-5|+|7-2| = 4+5=9  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk (distance >1).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (8,8):**  \nNext turn from (8,8):  \nUP (8,9) \u2013 my body segment 10 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (8,7) \u2013 my old head position, now body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (7,8) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT (9,8) \u2013 empty.  \nTwo safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**DOWN to (8,6):**  \nNext turn from (8,6):  \nUP (8,7) \u2013 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (8,5) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (7,6) \u2013 my body segment 3 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (9,6) \u2013 empty.  \nTwo safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,7):**  \nApple at (9,7) \u2192 eating it will grow to length 12.  \nAfter eating, body will be: head (9,7), then (8,7),(7,7),(7,6),\u2026,(8,9).  \n\nNext turn from (9,7) after eating:  \nUP (9,8) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN (9,6) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (8,7) \u2013 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo two safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (2,1), (1,1), (9,7), (0,2), (5,4).  \nRIGHT gets apple (9,7) immediately.  \nUP and DOWN move away from nearest apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety**  \nEnemy is at (5,2) with length 15, far from me.  \nEating apple now gets me to 11 apples, still behind enemy\u2019s 14.  \nBut RIGHT to (9,7) puts me at right edge, which could limit future moves if I\u2019m not careful. However, after eating, I\u2019ll have UP and DOWN available next turn, which keeps me along the right wall but not trapped yet.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple and keeps 2 safe moves next turn.  \nUP and DOWN give 2 safe moves next turn but no apple.  \nGiven enemy\u2019s lead, I should collect apples when safe.  \nRIGHT is safe now and gets an apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9,7) after eating, choose UP or DOWN based on enemy position and apple locations. Avoid moving back into body. Consider moving toward center after eating to keep options open.  \n\nRIGHT",
