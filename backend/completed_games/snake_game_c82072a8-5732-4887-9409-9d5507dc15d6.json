Let me reconsider...\n\nWait, I need to reconsider the immediate situation. My head is at (9, 0), and my body is [(9, 1), (9, 2), ...]. The enemy head is at (8, 0).\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully: UP moves to (9, 1) which is my immediate body segment. That's a collision with my own body.\n\nThis appears to be a losing position where I cannot survive this turn. However, let me verify the board state one more time:\n\nLooking at the visualization:\n- Row 0: positions show \".\" at 0-7, \"0\" at 8, \"1\" at 9\n- My snake (1) is at (9, 0) - head\n- Enemy snake (0) is at (8, 0) - head\n\nAll moves are blocked:\n- UP: into my body (9, 1)\n- DOWN: off board\n- LEFT: enemy head at (8, 0) - collision\n- RIGHT: off board\n\nSince I must make a move and all moves result in death, I should choose the move that makes the most game-theoretic sense. LEFT results in a head-on collision where the enemy also dies. Since both snakes die on the same turn, the tiebreaker is whoever has more apples (me: 6, enemy: 4), so I would win.\n\n**Plan for future (if applicable):** This position was likely not ideal. The previous move DOWN may have been a mistake in hindsight, as it trapped me in a corner with the enemy.\n\nLEFT",
