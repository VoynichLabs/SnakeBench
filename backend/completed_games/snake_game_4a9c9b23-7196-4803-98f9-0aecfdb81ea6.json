Board is completely empty - no bodies anywhere!\n\nLet me check my safe moves:\n- UP to (7,4): Safe! Inside board, no body there\n- DOWN to (7,2): Safe! Inside board, no body there\n- LEFT to (6,3): Safe! Inside board, no body there\n- RIGHT to (8,3): Safe! Inside board, no body there\n\nAll four directions are safe right now! But we need to think strategically. The closest apple is at (8,3), which is to my RIGHT. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to that apple cluster and the northeast area where more apples are spawning.\n\nThe enemy is pretty far away at (0,3), so no immediate collision threat. I should focus on positioning myself to control the board and maybe force a head-on collision later when I have more apples.\n\nI'm gonna go RIGHT to (8,3) to start working my way toward those apples while keeping my mobility open for future turns.\n\nRIGHT",
