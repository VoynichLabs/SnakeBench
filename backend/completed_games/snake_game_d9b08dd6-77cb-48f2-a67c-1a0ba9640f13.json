Safe from backwards rule.\n- Opponent head: (7,1). Also length 1.\n- All four immediate moves are on-board and not an instant crash. No apple focus right now \u2014 we want control and to pressure the enemy.\n\nMove-by-move thinking (eliminate deadly options first):\n- UP -> (1,2): Safe. Keeps lots of freedom (can go L/R/U next turn). Moves slightly toward center and gives good mobility. Nice conservative option.\n- DOWN -> (1,0): Safe but hugs the bottom edge (fewer future vertical moves). Can aim for apple at (0,0) but reduces escape routes \u2014 riskier for being boxed.\n- LEFT -> (0,1): Safe but on the left wall \u2014 much less freedom. Only 3 exits and corner potential. Bad for aggressive maneuvering.\n- RIGHT -> (2,1): Safe and aggressive. Moves me toward the opponent along the same row, but still plenty of escape routes (up/down/right). Opponent is far enough that a head-on this turn is very unlikely. This both pressures him and keeps options open for cutting him off next turns.\n\nRationale / short-term plan for next few turns:\n- Push RIGHT to close the gap and threaten to cut off his horizontal escape. If he drifts toward me (left), I\u2019ll continue to advance and try to corral him between me and the right side of the board. If he moves up/down, I\u2019ll pivot to mirror and take the high ground (move up) to reduce his vertical options.\n- Don\u2019t force a head-on unless I get ahead on apples. Use positioning to limit his choices and then grow to dominate space.\n- Always keep at least two escape routes available \u2014 avoid hugging walls unless I'm actively boxing him against them.\n\nAlright fans \u2014 time to send the pressure. Ready? LET'S GO!!!\n\nRIGHT",

Time to plot our dominance! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**TURN 1 ANALYSIS:**\n- **Board State:** 10x10, apples scattered everywhere like loot drops! Enemy at (2,1), me at (7,2).\n- **My Position:** (7,2) - nice central spot on the right side. Body is empty, so I have full mobility! \ud83d\udca8\n- **Enemy Position:** (2,1) - way over on the left side. He's isolated in the west corner.\n- **Apples Nearby:** (7,3) is literally 1 tile above me - that's FREE FOOD! Also (8,6) to the northeast, (7,5) north, and (8,9) top-right corner.\n- **Score:** We're both at 0-0. Need to start stacking apples first!\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES:**\n- **UP (7,3):** Moves me onto apple (7,3)! FREE GROWTH! Opens up to (7,4), (6,3), (8,3) options. SAFE - no body collisions.\n- **DOWN (7,1):** Open space, but moves AWAY from the apple above me. Wasteful.\n- **LEFT (6,2):** Open space, moves toward center-left but away from (7,3) apple. Not optimal.\n- **RIGHT (8,2):** Open space, moves toward right edge but away from apple. Not optimal.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEnemy is trapped in the west corner! We need to claim the center-right territory and start growing. Taking (7,3) gives us our first point and positions us to dominate the eastern half of the board. Once we have size advantage, we can start boxing him in! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nFirst apple secured at (7,3). Then push toward (8,6) and (8,9) to claim the entire right side. Force enemy into a corner and end this early! \n\n**DECISION:** UP - free apple, first blood, let's gooo! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Aggression is the name of the game \u2014 we want to pressure his escape routes.\n- Keeps multiple follow-up exits (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) so we won't get boxed immediately.\n- No immediate head-on risk this turn \u2014 opponent is far enough that a simultaneous collision into the same cell is impossible.\n- Avoids wall-hugging (unlike LEFT or DOWN) so we maintain freedom to pivot if he jukes vertically.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep advancing right to take ground and threaten cuts. Mirror his vertical moves to limit his options; if he drifts toward the right wall, close and force a head-on only if we have more apples.\n- Always maintain at least two escape routes; if forced toward an edge, pivot vertically to keep options.\n- Use growth opportunistically \u2014 grab apples only when it helps dominate space, not at the cost of getting trapped.\n\nLET\u2019S PRESS \u2014 TIME TO MOVE!  \nRIGHT",

No growth for him yet! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Board State:** I see apples at (8,6), (7,5), (8,9), (5,0), (7,0), and others. The right side is OPEN for the taking!\n- **Score:** 1-0 - We're leading! Time to snowball this advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES:**\n- **UP (7,4):** Safe! Moves me toward (7,5) apple. Opens up (7,5), (6,4), (8,4). Good positioning.\n- **DOWN (7,2):** WAIT - That's my BODY! My tail is at (7,2). Moving there would be HEAD-ON into my own body - INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n- **LEFT (6,3):** Safe! Moves toward center. Could chase (5,0) or (6,0) apples. Opens (6,4), (5,3), (7,3) - but (7,3) is where I just came from.\n- **RIGHT (8,3):** Safe! Moves toward right edge. Opens (8,4), (9,3), (8,2). Could chase (8,6) or (8,9) apples.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nEnemy is still stuck on the left! I need to claim MORE territory while I have the size advantage. (7,4) UP gives me the best route to dominate the right side - I can then go for (8,6) or (8,9). \n\nLEFT toward center is tempting, but the right side is MINE to claim! RIGHT (8,3) also good, but UP gets me closer to multiple apple clusters.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nClaim the right side, box enemy into left corner, grow to size 10+, then start cutting off his escape routes. Once we're big enough, we force the collision! \ud83d\udd2a\n\n**DECISION:** UP - moving toward that sweet (7,5) apple and dominating the right flank!\n\nUP",

None of those coincide with any of my candidate cells this turn, so no instant head-on threat this move. Good \u2014 we can press without risking a double KO now.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Aggression with caution: it gains ground toward #1 and starts corralling him toward the right wall, but there is no immediate head-on risk this turn.\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT still available next turns), unlike DOWN which would pinch us to the edge.\n- Matches our plan to dominate space and pressure their escape routes while avoiding a reckless head-on because they have the higher score.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be shown as next turn\u2019s rationale):\n- Keep moving right/up as needed to reduce his safe area on the right flank.

Why?\n1. **APPLE HUNTING:** (8,6) has an APPLE! We eat it \u2192 size 4 + another point! We're reaching size 4 while the enemy is still size 1! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **POSITIONING:** Moving UP keeps us on the right side where apples are CLUSTERED.

The enemy can't beat us in size yet!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (8,6) \u2192 size 4. Then chase (8,9) or (7,0) to reach size 5+. Once size 5+, start BLOCKING the left side by positioning at (6,6) or (5,7) to cut off enemy escape routes.

They can go UP to (8,6) (likely), RIGHT (9,5), or DOWN (8,4). We\u2019re down 0\u21922, so NO reckless head-on until we have leverage. Stay aggressive, keep options open, and press to box him in.\n\nMove-by-move sanity check:\n- UP -> (6,2): safe, centralizes, lots of follow-ups. Good control.\n- DOWN -> (6,0): apple at (6,0) \u2014 would give +1 but pins us to y=0 (fewer options). Avoid early self-constriction.\n- LEFT -> (5,1): safe, retreats and gives space, but loses pressure on opponent.\n- RIGHT -> (7,1): safe, advances toward opponent\u2019s x-line, lines us up to start hemming him from below without forcing head-on.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (we\u2019re not pinned to a wall yet) while moving toward the opponent\u2019s column so we can cut off lateral escapes later.\n- Avoids grabbing the bottom-row apple now (we\u2019re not going to trap ourselves). We want apples as a tool to dominate, not as an early leash.\n- Opponent likely goes UP to (8,6) for an apple \u2014 if they do, we can pivot UP after a RIGHT to start compressing vertical escape routes. If they try RIGHT/DOWN, we still keep freedom to chase and box.\n- No collision risk this turn; preserves ability to force a head-on later only if we have more apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Continue pressing right to x=8 while staying one or two rows below him. If he heads toward the right wall or up for apples, pivot UP to reduce his vertical space and close corridors.\n- Don\u2019t commit to the bottom apples yet. Eat apples only when they improve board control or give us a scoring edge for a head-on.\n- If he drifts left into our column, be ready to back off or bait him into moving into our body; only force head-on if we tie or lead apples.\n\nLet\u2019s make him choke on his mistakes.

No body segments. Opponent head = (8,6) with body at (8,5),(7,5),(7,4) and 3 apples. They cannot move DOWN into (8,5) (their own body), so their options are UP (8,7), LEFT (7,6), or RIGHT (9,6).\n- Nearby apples: (7,0) below us, cluster on the bottom-left, several high apples up top. We don\u2019t need to chase apples obsessively \u2014 use them when they help dominate.\n- Immediate danger? None. All four moves are survivable right now. No head-on can happen this turn unless we both try to land on the same square (not happening).\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- UP -> (7,2): Safe, keeps many follow-ups, begins vertical approach. Good control.\n- DOWN -> (7,0): Grabs apple (+1). But eating creates a body segment at (7,1) next turn, which would make BACK-UP (to (7,1)) impossible and could limit mobility on the first move after growth. Risk of getting boxed if we commit to bottom too soon.\n- LEFT -> (6,1): Safe, retreats toward center. Keeps options but loses immediate pressure on opponent.\n- RIGHT -> (8,1): Safe, directly under the opponent\u2019s column. Keeps multiple follow-ups (UP to start compressing them, LEFT/RIGHT for lateral play). Maintains pressure and sets up a vertical squeeze toward the right wall. Low immediate risk.\n\nStrategic thought: we\u2019re behind 0\u20133. We need apples to threaten head-on later, but don\u2019t rush into a trap by gobbling the bottom apple right now. Better to get under them and start compressing their space \u2014 move into their column, then climb. If they drift right into the wall, we pivot up and cut off their vertical escape. If they step left toward x=7, we can bait and react \u2014 never force a head-on while behind on apples.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (8,1) to align under them. Then push UP along x=8 to reduce their vertical room. Eat apples opportunistically only when they improve board control or give us parity for a safe head-on later. Keep exits open (don\u2019t get pinned to a single corridor).\n\nReady to press the attack and start the squeeze? Let\u2019s get it \u2014 time to box him in! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Puts us directly under their column (x=8). Gives strong vertical pressure and multiple follow-ups (L/R/U).\n- DOWN -> (8,0): SAFE but hugs the bottom wall and moves away from the opponent. Less pressure, fewer aggressive options.\n- LEFT -> (7,1): SAFE. Decent lateral play, but slower to compress their vertical lane.\n- RIGHT -> (9,1): SAFE but shoves us into the right wall early \u2014 can be powerful to trap later but reduces immediate escape routes.\n\nImmediate threats: none \u2014 no move causes instant death. Opponent at (8,7) cannot go DOWN (blocked by their body at (8,6)), so their likely options are UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7), or RIGHT to the apple at (9,7). They want apples and space.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Climbing into their column (8) now starts a vertical squeeze. If they head right for the apple (9,7) we can follow up to cut them off along x=8/x=9. If they drift left, we can pivot and corral them toward our growing wall.\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups open (LEFT/RIGHT/UP) \u2014 preserving mobility is priority since we\u2019re currently behind on apples (0 vs 3). Avoid grabbing bottom apple this turn; growth now would limit our flexibility.\n- Avoids early wall-trap on the right/bottom that could let them bait a head-on while we\u2019re at fewer apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb column x=8 to (8,2) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (8,4) as needed to compress vertical space.\n- If they go to x=9 for (9,7), shadow and try to cut lateral escapes; if they go left, pivot to block exits toward the center.\n- Only force a head-on if we have apple parity/advantage or can guarantee they hit our body; otherwise outmaneuver and pick apples opportunistically to gain parity.\n\nWatch their move \u2014 we\u2019re setting up a squeeze.

Puts me directly under their column and keeps L/R/D follow-ups. UP next-turn into (8,5) would be illegal right now (occupied by their body), but moving to (8,4) maintains pressure.\n- DOWN -> (8,2): SAFE but passive; gives them room to escape and pick apples.\n- LEFT -> (7,3): SAFE and aggressive \u2014 cuts their left escape later.\n- RIGHT -> (9,3): SAFE but wall-hugging, reduces future mobility.\n\nImmediate opponent constraints:\n- Opponent head at (8,9) with neck at (8,8) \u2192 they cannot go DOWN (that\u2019s their neck) or UP (off-board). They are forced to go LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9) this turn. That means we can predict their lateral exit and prepare to cut them off.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Keeps maximum pressure on their vertical column. By occupying (8,4) I start compressing them downwards and shrink their safe space when they later move into row 9.\n- Keeps more flexible follow-ups than hugging the wall (RIGHT) and is more immediately threatening than dropping back (DOWN).\n- LEFT is also tempting to pre-block, but staying in the column means I can pivot to either side next turn depending on which way they go \u2014 reactive aggression > premature commit.\n- We are down on apples (0 vs 4), so don\u2019t force a head-on. We box, bait, and take apples opportunistically.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 stash this as last rationale):\n- Hold column x=8: move to (8,4) now, then react to their LEFT/RIGHT choice on row 9.\n- If they go left to (7,9), pivot LEFT next turn to cut column 7 and trap them; if they go right to (9,9), pivot LEFT too (from the column) to block exits rather than hugging the wall.\n- Avoid head-on until we can guarantee either survival or apple advantage. Use their forced lateral move to begin boxing them in and grabbing apples along the edges when safe.\n\nUP",

Still DOMINATING! \ud83d\ude80\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 at (8, 4) - Still size 1! They're crawling while we're UNSTOPPABLE! \ud83d\ude02\n- **Board State:** We're at (7, 9) - SECOND SPOT FROM THE CORNER! We just moved LEFT last turn!\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **UP (7, 10):** \u274c DEAD! Off the board! NO GO!\n- **DOWN (7, 8):** \u274c DEAD! That's where our body tail was! It's moving, but that's still our body segment (8, 8) will shift there! CRASH!\n- **LEFT (6, 9):** \u2705 SAFE! (6, 9) is empty! Opens up to (5,9), (6,8), (7,9) - 3 safe options!\n- **RIGHT (8, 9):** \u274c DEAD! That's our OLD head position! Our body is moving into (8, 9)! CRASH!\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nLEFT to (6, 9) is the PLAY! Why?\n1. **SAFE EXIT:** LEFT is our ONLY safe move! Both UP and DOWN and RIGHT are deadly! We HAVE to go LEFT or we're DEAD! \ud83c\udfaf\n2. **APPLE HUNTING:** From (6, 9), we're one step CLOSER to apples at (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), and (2, 9)! These are ALL within reach! We're going on an apple spree! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** By moving LEFT along the top row, we're building a \"wall\" that cuts off the right side from the enemy! If they try to go up, they'll hit our body!\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** Enemy is still at (8, 4) - they could try to go UP to (8, 5) or (8, 6), but we're moving AWAY from them, staying safe and dominating the top!\n5. **LONG-TERM VISION:** Once we eat those apples at (5,9) and (4,9), we'll be size 6+! Then we can curve DOWN through the right side and start clearing the rest of the board! We're building a fortress brick by brick!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nNext turn \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 then LEFT to (5, 9) to eat that apple! Once we're size 6, we can either continue LEFT to (4, 9) or start curving DOWN through (5, 8) and (5, 7) to dominate the center! The goal is to create a snake-shaped barrier that traps the enemy in the bottom-right while we feast! We're playing chess while they're playing checkers! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT - IT'S OUR ONLY SAFE MOVE, AND IT LEADS DIRECTLY TO APPLE TOWN! LET'S GOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Tempts a risky approach into their column \u2014 not great when we're down 0\u21924 apples.\n- DOWN -> (8,3): safe and conservative. Keeps options but passive \u2014 gives them room to maneuver up top.\n- RIGHT -> (9,4): safe but wall-hugging. Reduces escape routes and flexibility. Not ideal for an aggressive trap.\n- LEFT -> (7,4): safe and aggressive. Puts me in the same file as their head (x=7) so I can climb and cut exits when they move.\n\nOpponent read: head is at (7,9) with neck at (8,9), body down (8,8),(8,7),(8,6). That means they CANNOT go RIGHT (neck) or UP (off-board). Their only legal options this turn are LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8). Nice \u2014 predictable! \ud83d\udc40\n\nWhy LEFT?\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (0 vs 4), so we DON\u2019T want a head-on. We need to box, not suicide.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,4) is an aggressive zoning move: it lines us up with their head column so we can climb and hem them in if they drop down. It avoids stepping into the column directly beneath their body (so less chance of immediate awkward collisions).\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups: UP to start climbing, or RIGHT to re-enter column 8 if needed. Better than committing to the wall or retreating.\n\nShort-term plan (stash this as next-turn rationale):\n- Move LEFT now to (7,4).\n- If they go DOWN to (7,8), pivot UP next turn to (7,5) then (7,6) to pressure and march up; threaten to cut their downward escape.\n- If they go LEFT to (6,9), start climbing column 7 to box them toward the top-left \u2014 force them into tighter space and exploit any mistake.\n- Avoid head-on until we can guarantee survival or apple parity.\n\nLET\u2019S GET IT \u2014 aggressive, flexible, and safe.

Likely moves: LEFT to (4,9) to grab that apple, or DOWN to (5,8) to drop toward the board interior.\n  - If they go LEFT, they\u2019ll grow and be harder to trap \u2014 we should deny easy space later.\n  - If they go DOWN, they\u2019ll approach our vertical lane and we can apply pressure.\n\nWhy UP is best now:\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (we can keep climbing, swing left to cut them, or drop back if needed).\n- Puts vertical pressure above them so when/if they descend we can pivot to hem them in.\n- Avoids x=8 column where their body is stacked \u2014 less chance of accidental head-on scrums.\n- We are down on apples (0 vs 5) so we AVOID forcing a head-to-head. UP maintains flexibility to corral, not suicide.\n\nShort-term / long-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale clip):\n- Keep climbing the center column (7,6 -> 7,7) to control mid-high board.\n- If opponent drops toward us, pivot LEFT to x=6 then x=5 to cut their exits and chase them into our vertical wall.\n- If opponent veers left to collect (4,9), close the gap horizontally and threaten their return path so they can\u2019t freely roam; pick apples opportunistically only when safe.\n- NEVER trade head-on unless we\u2019ve closed the apple gap \u2014 we\u2019ll force them into crashing into our body, not collide.\n\nWe\u2019re being patient and aggressive \u2014 pressure, then trap.

He's size 1. He's going to move. Where can he go? He might see apples at (5,0) or (7,0) or try to flank us. But we are at the top!\n- **Board State:** I am at (3, 9). The top row is open to my LEFT. My body occupies (4, 9) through (8, 9) and (8, 8).\n\n**ELIMINATING DEADLY MOVES:**\n- **UP (3, 10):** \u274c **DEAD!** Off the board. NO GO.\n- **DOWN (3, 8):** \u274c **RISKY!** (3, 8) is empty *now*, but check the logic. If I move DOWN, my body shifts. My head goes to (3, 8). My old head (3, 9) becomes part of the body. But wait... look at my body list. Currently: Head (3, 9) -> (4, 9) ... -> (8, 8). If I move DOWN to (3, 8), my body becomes [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. The tail (8, 8) moves away. Is (3, 8) safe? It's empty. BUT, look at the board. (2, 8) is empty. (3, 7) has an apple. Actually, DOWN seems safe *physically*. However, let's look at the geometry. I am building a wall. If I go DOWN, I am cutting off my own retreat slightly and moving into the \"board\" where the enemy might be.\n- **LEFT (2, 9):** \u2705 **SAFE!** (2, 9) is empty. Top row is clear.\n- **RIGHT (4, 9):** \u274c **DEAD!** (4, 9) is my *current* body (specifically, the neck). I cannot move into my own neck. That's a crash.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n**LEFT is the play!** \ud83c\udfae\nWhy?\n1.  **SAFETY FIRST:** LEFT is the *only* move guaranteed not to kill me immediately (DOWN is physically empty, but let's analyze why LEFT is superior).\n2.  **BOARD CONTROL:** I am at (3, 9). Moving LEFT to (2, 9) continues my march along the top edge. I am creating a \"wall\" of my body along y=9 from x=2 to x=8. This effectively splits the board. The enemy is at (6, 6). He is below this wall.\n3.  **BOXING HIM IN:** By moving LEFT, I am consolidating my position. If I go DOWN now, I expose my flank. By staying on the top row, I force the enemy to stay in the bottom half of the board. He has to go around my long body.\n4.  **ENEMY PREDICTION:** The enemy is at (6, 6). He wants apples. There are apples at (9, 7) and (4, 8). (4, 8) is dangerous for him because it's close to my tail. (9, 7) is far right. By moving LEFT, I am not interfering with his path to (9, 7), but I am securing my own territory.\n5.  **FUTURE MOVES:** From (2, 9), I can continue LEFT to (1, 9), or eventually curve DOWN. From (3, 9), if I went DOWN to (3, 8), I would be sandwiched between my own body at (4, 9) and the open board. It's safer to stay on the edge.\n\n**DECISION:** **LEFT** - Keep the wall tight, stay safe on the edge, and prepare to trap him! LET'S GOOO!\n\nLEFT",

No instant kills available. So all are survivable.\n\n3) Choose among the safe moves by prioritizing future options and aggression without risking a head-on:\n   - We\u2019re 0 apples vs 6 apples.

It also nudges us toward the middle of the board so we can start hemming them in horizontally.\n\nShort-term plan (for next 1\u20133 turns):\n- Move LEFT to (5,6) to keep maximum escape options and start pressuring horizontally.\n- Next turn, read their move \u2014 if they push right/up toward the wall, pivot UP and begin corralling their space toward top-left; if they retreat/down, press to cut off access to apples around x=3\u20135.\n- Avoid any simultaneous head-into-head unless we\u2019ve closed the apple gap. Grow only when it helps trap them, not just for the stat.\n\nWe\u2019re staying aggressive but not suicidal. Time to close the gap smartly for the box-in. LET\u2019S MAKE HIM CRASH.\n\nLEFT",

We are at (2, 9). We need to close the trap.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECKING MOVES FROM HEAD (2, 9):**\n    *   **UP (2, 10):** \u274c **DEAD.** Off the board.\n    *   **DOWN (2, 8):** \u274c **DEAD.** (2, 8) is currently empty, BUT... if I move DOWN, my head goes to (2, 8). My body currently is [(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. After the move, my new body becomes [(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. The tail (8, 9) moves away. (2, 8) is empty. WAIT. Let me check the board state again.\n        *   Board row 8: ` . . . . A . . . . . ` (y=8)\n        *   (2, 8) is empty.\n        *   However, looking at the *last move rationale*, the user moved LEFT to (2, 9) to build a wall. Moving DOWN from (2, 9) to (2, 8) creates a \"dent\" in the wall. The enemy at (5, 6) is below. If I go DOWN, I am moving towards the center. Is it safe?\n        *   Let's look at the enemy. Snake #0 at (5, 6). It's size 1. It can move in 4 directions.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (2, 8), the enemy could potentially move towards (2, 8)? Unlikely, it's far.\n        *   BUT, looking at my own body logic... wait. My body currently occupies (3, 9) through (8, 9). If I move DOWN, I create a gap at (2, 9) which becomes my body. The cell (2, 8) is free.\n        *   *Self-Correction*: The previous turn's move was LEFT to (2, 9). The body list provided is `[(3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)]`. The head is (2, 9).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (2, 8), I am moving into an empty cell. It is *physically* safe from immediate collision.\n        *   **HOWEVER**, look at the board state row 8. (3, 8) is empty, (2, 8) is empty.\n        *   Let's look at the board state provided in the prompt.\n        *   Row 9: ` . . 1 T T T T T T . ` (My head is at 2,9. The body parts are T's).\n        *   Row 8: ` . . . . A . . . . . `\n        *   Row 7: ` . . . A . . . . . A `\n        *   Row 6: ` . . . . . 0 . . . . `\n        *   (2, 8) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (2, 7) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (2, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Moving DOWN to (2, 8) seems safe. BUT, let's check the *Last Move Rationale* again. It says: \"LEFT is the play! ... I am creating a 'wall' of my body along y=9.\"\n        *   If I move DOWN, I am breaking my own wall formation. I am exposing my flank. The enemy is at (5, 6). If I go to (2, 8), the enemy could potentially flank around the side if I don't control the space.\n        *   Let's check **LEFT (1, 9)**.\n        *   (1, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (0, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Moving LEFT continues the wall. It keeps me at the top edge, maximizing safety. The top edge is the safest place to be because you can't die going off the board (except x<0).\n        *   **RIGHT (3, 9)**.\n        *   (3, 9) is currently my body (the neck). \u274c **DEAD.** Can't move into self.\n        *   **DOWN (2, 8)**.\n        *   (2, 8) is empty. It seems safe. But is it *strategic*?\n        *   If I go DOWN to (2, 8), I am moving into the open board. The enemy is at (5, 6). The distance is closing. Head-on collision risks increase.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (1, 9), I am moving away from the enemy. I am securing the corner. I am maintaining the \"wall\" strategy.\n        *   **Strategic Plan:**\n        *   The enemy is at (5, 6). He wants apples. There are apples at (3, 7), (2, 2), (0, 0).\n        *   If I stay at the top, I force him to stay below y=9.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (2, 8), I am entering the \"arena\". This increases the chance of a head-on collision.\n        *   Since the enemy has 0 apples and I have 6, I should play safe. I have the lead. I don't *need* to take risks.\n        *   Also, look at the board. (4, 8) has an apple. If I go DOWN to (2, 8), I am closer to (3, 7) and (2, 2).\n        *   BUT, look at the body. My body is a long line at y=9. If I go DOWN to (2, 8), the next turn I can move to (2, 7), (1, 8), or (3, 8).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (1, 9), the next turn I can move to (0, 9), (1, 8).\n        *   The top row (y=9) is clear. (0, 9) is empty.\n        *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #0 is at (5, 6). It has 0 apples. It's small. It will likely chase apples. Apples at (3, 7), (2, 2), (0, 0). It might move UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6) or (3, 6) towards the cluster.\n        *   If I stay at the top (LEFT), I am not interfering with its path to (3, 7) directly, but I am blocking the top exit.\n        *   If I go DOWN, I am blocking the path to (2, 2) and (0, 0) potentially.\n        *   Let's look at the \"Wall\" strategy. I am currently at x=2 on y=9. The wall extends to x=8.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (1, 9), the wall is now x=1 to x=8.\n        *   The enemy is at (5, 6).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (2, 8), I open up the top row slightly, but I start \"hunting\" or \"cutting off\" the bottom.\n        *   However, the safest move is always to stick to the edge when you have a lead. The edge reduces degrees of freedom for the enemy to trap you.\n        *   **Decision:**\n        *   **LEFT (1, 9)** is the safest move. It keeps me on the edge. It maintains the wall. It avoids moving into the center where the enemy is.\n        *   **DOWN (2, 8)** is risky because it moves me towards the enemy. The enemy might move UP. If I go DOWN to (2, 8) and Enemy goes UP to (5, 7), the board state changes.\n        *   **Refined Strategy:**\n        *   I am winning 6-0.\n        *   I should not take risks unless forced.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (1, 9) extends my wall to the left edge.\n        *   From (1, 9), I can eventually drop down at x=0 or x=1.\n        *   The enemy is at (5, 6). If I go LEFT, I am at (1, 9). The enemy has to navigate around my long body (which occupies y=9, x=1..8).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (2, 8), I am moving into the open space.\n        *   **Verdict:** LEFT is the play. It maintains the defensive perimeter. It prevents the enemy from getting above me (impossible anyway, but keeps the space tight).\n        *   Check for immediate death:\n        *   LEFT to (1, 9): Is it empty? Yes. Is it off board? No. Is it my body? No (My body is 3,9 to 8,9 and 2,9 is head). Wait, if I move, my head moves from (2,9) to (1,9). My body will shift. The cell (1,9) is currently empty.\n        *   Is there an apple at (1,9)? No.\n        *   Is there an apple at (1,2)? Yes.\n        *   I am not eating an apple this turn. That's fine. I am controlling space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep the perimeter tight. I am building a wall on the top row (y=9) from x=0 to x=8. The enemy is forced to stay below y=8. Once the wall is complete (head at 0,9), I will drop down to y=0 and sweep the bottom row, boxing the enemy into the right side or trapping them against their own tail. I have the score lead, so I play safe and squeeze.\n\n**TURN 15 ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head (2, 9).\n- **Enemy Position:** Head (5, 6).\n- **Move LEFT to (1, 9):** Safe. Extends wall. Keeps me out of enemy range.\n- **Move DOWN to (2, 8):** Unsafe/Risky. Moves me toward the enemy. Exposes me to center play.\n- **Move RIGHT to (3, 9):** Self-collision. DEAD.\n- **Move UP:** Off board. DEAD.\n\n**DECISION:** **LEFT**\n\nLEFT",

Actually, looking at the board state provided for Turn 16:\n` 9 . 1 T T T T T T . .`\nWait, the prompt says:\n`YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):`\n`  - Head: (1, 9)`\n`  - Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]`\n\nOkay, so I moved LEFT to (1, 9) as planned.

I would die instantly.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8):** \u2705 **SAFE.** (1, 8) is empty on the board state.\n\n2.  **ANALYSIS:**\n    *   I am at (1, 9). The enemy is at (4, 6).\n    *   **Option: LEFT to (0, 9).**\n        *   This places my head at the corner (0, 9). This completes the top wall. I will be boxed into the top edge, but it's safe.

If the enemy gets behind me (which is impossible because I'm at the wall), or if I block my own exit... wait, no.\n        *   If I go to (0, 9), next turn I must go DOWN to (0, 8). (0, 8) is empty.\n        *   This seems like a very slow, safe play. But is it *winning*? I have 6 apples.

It opens up my options.\n        *   From (1, 8), I can go to (1, 7), (0, 8), or (2, 8) next turn (can't go up to 1,9 because that's my body).\n        *   Why would I move down?\n        *   Look at the apples. There is an apple at (0, 0), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), etc.\n        *   If I stay at the top, I am far from the food.\n        *   However, my goal is to box the enemy in.\n        *   The enemy is at (4, 6). He is below me.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 8), I am stepping down into the arena.\n        *   Let's look at the enemy's potential moves from (4, 6). He has 0 apples. He wants to grow. Apples near him: (3, 7) is close. (3, 4) is close. (2, 3) is close.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 8), I am getting closer to the apple at (2, 8)??? No, (2, 8) is empty on the board. Wait, the board state shows row 8: ` . . . .

My body is (2,9) through (7,9).\n        *   (0, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (1, 8) is `.` (Empty).\n\n    *   **Why LEFT to (0, 9) is the winning move:**\n        *   I have 6 apples. The enemy has 0.\n        *   The enemy is at (4, 6).\n        *   If I move to (0, 9), I am in the corner.\n        *   From the corner, I am forced to move DOWN next turn (to 0,8).\n        *   This effectively shifts my \"wall\" from the top row to the left column.\n        *   I will be constructing a vertical wall on x=0.\n        *   This pushes the enemy to the right (x > 0).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 8), I am opening up the top row (x > 1) and moving into the center.\n        *   The enemy is at (4, 6). If I go to (1, 8), the distance is 5 tiles (Manhattan distance approx).\n        *   If I go to (0, 9), the distance is larger.\n        *   Since I am winning, I should not close the distance unnecessarily. I should extend my perimeter (the wall).\n        *   Moving to (0, 9) extends my wall to the left edge. This is the final piece of the top barrier.\n        *   Then, next turn, I will move DOWN to (0, 8). This starts the left-side barrier.\n        *   This strategy squeezes the enemy into the right side of the board (x > 0).\n        *   The enemy is currently at x=4. If I take x=0, he is restricted to x=1..9.\n        *   This is a classic Snake domination tactic: claim the edge, force the opponent into the center or the opposite edge where they are more likely to crash.\n\n    *   **Check for Head-on Collision:**\n        *   Enemy moves from (4, 6). Can he reach (0, 9) or (1, 8) in one turn? No. Max distance is 1 tile.\n        *   Can he reach my *body*? No, I am at y=9. He is at y=6. He can't hit my body this turn.\n        *   Can he hit my head? Only if I move to the same cell as him. Impossible from these distances.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   LEFT to (0, 9) is the \"Claim the Corner\" strategy. It's safe and sets up a vertical wall on the left edge.\n        *   DOWN to (1, 8) is \"Roaming\". It's more flexible but riskier as I enter the main play area.\n        *   Given the 6-0 lead, I choose **LEFT**. Secure the edge. Squeeze the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 9) to complete the top barrier. Next turn, I will be forced to move DOWN to (0, 8) to start the left-side barrier. I will slowly descend the left edge (x=0), forcing the enemy into the right half of the board (x > 0). Once I reach the bottom, I will sweep right, boxing the enemy against the right wall or their own tail.\n\n**TURN 16 ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head (1, 9).\n- **Enemy Position:** Head (4, 6).\n- **Move LEFT to (0, 9):** Safe. Completes the top wall. Prepares the left wall. Maintains distance from enemy.\n- **Move DOWN to (1, 8):** Safe, but moves me into the open center. Less controlling.\n\n**DECISION:** **LEFT**\n\nLEFT",

They can only go LEFT to (0,9) or DOWN to (1,8) this turn.

Play smart: pressure and box, don\u2019t suicide for glory.\n\nMove options:\n- UP -> (4,7): moves toward them, keeps multiple escape options, puts pressure vertically. From there we can threaten to cut their descent or pivot left to get between them and the rest of the board.\n- LEFT -> (3,6): safe, keeps center control and options, gradual approach \u2014 conservative.\n- RIGHT -> (5,6): drifts away from them toward their tail zone later; less useful for immediate boxing.\n- DOWN -> (4,5): safe but passive \u2014 lets them keep farming apples unchallenged.\n\nChoice rationale \u2014 being aggressive but not reckless:\n- We need to close vertical distance so we can threaten their only descent route (the gap at y=8). UP gives us the best immediate posture to pressure their choice next turn while retaining multiple follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN available from (4,7)).\n- We will NOT attempt a head-on while behind on apples. Instead we\u2019ll use position to limit their escape options and bait mistakes.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns:\n- Move UP now to approach. If opponent goes DOWN to (1,8), pivot LEFT and then UP to try to seal off columns near x=1\u20133 and force them into a tighter corridor where we can herd them away from apples.\n- If they go LEFT and stay on row 9, chase left and then cut down to keep them stuck along the wall and reduce their mobility.\n- Grow only when it helps close exits or secure a trap \u2014 don\u2019t risk simultaneous-head collisions while we\u2019re trailing on apples.\n\nLet\u2019s box him in, make him sweat, and force the error.

I moved DOWN last turn.\n\n**Available Moves from (0, 8):**\n*   **UP:** Back to (0, 9). That's my old body part! \u274c DEAD (unless the tail moves, but it's risky).\n*   **LEFT:** Off board. \u274c DEAD.\n*   **RIGHT:** (1, 8). Checking the board: `8 1 . . . A . . . . .` -> Wait, (1, 8) is empty in the visual grid. But let's look closer. The text says my body is at (0,9) -> (5,9). (1,8) is definitely empty. This is safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (0, 7). Checking the board: `7 . . . 0 T . . . . A`. (0, 7) is empty. Safe.\n\n**The Strategy Check:**\nI am trying to build a **Left Wall Barrier** to box in the enemy (Snake #0 at (3, 7)).\n*   If I go **DOWN** to (0, 7), I continue down the left edge.\n    *   **Pros:** It gets me closer to the apple at (0, 2) and eventually (0, 0). It maintains the barrier.\n    *   **Cons:** I am moving towards the enemy's general y-coordinate (he is at y=7). He is at x=3. I am at x=0. There is distance.\n*   If I go **RIGHT** to (1, 8):\n    *   **Pros:** I clear the corner. I open up the top side again.\n    *   **Cons:** I break my wall formation. I give the enemy breathing room on the left side. I am not advancing towards the low apples.\n\n**Aggression vs. Safety:**\nThe enemy has 1 apple. I have 6. I am winning.\nThe \"Box In\" strategy requires me to take space. The left side is valuable real estate.\n**Apple Check:** (0, 7) is empty. (0, 6) is empty. (0, 5) is empty. (0, 4) is empty. (0, 3) is empty. (0, 2) has an apple.\nBy going DOWN, I am walking a safe path directly toward an apple.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nSnake #0 is at (3, 7). With 1 apple, he's probably looking for food. There's an apple at (3, 4) or (3, 3). He might move DOWN. He is far from me (x=3 vs x=0). A collision is unlikely this turn.\nIf he moves UP towards (4,8) or (6,0) etc, he moves away from me.\n\n**The Move:**\nI need to secure the bottom-left corner. Moving **DOWN** is the most aggressive way to claim territory and line up for the apples at (0, 2) and (0, 0).\nMoving RIGHT feels passive. I want to cage him.\n\n**Decision:** **DOWN**\n\nDOWN",

Neck/body: (4,7) (so RIGHT would be moving *back* into our neck = instant death). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Opponent head: (0,8) with body across (0,9)-(5,9). From (0,8) they can go RIGHT to (1,8) or DOWN to (0,7). They cannot go UP (into their neck) or LEFT (off-board).\n- Head-on risk check: their possible moves this turn are (1,8) or (0,7). Our candidate moves (UP\u21923,8, DOWN\u21923,6, LEFT\u21922,7) do NOT coincide with those, so no immediate head-on risk this turn. Good \u2014 we avoid trading our low apple count for a double KO.\n\nEvaluate all four directions:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7): forbidden (into our own neck). DEAD.\n- UP \u2192 (3,8): safe, keeps options, moves toward apples at (4,8). More passive.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6): safe, conservative, keeps lots of room but delays pressure.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7): safe and aggressive \u2014 closes the horizontal gap to the enemy, helps set up a box toward columns 0\u20132 while keeping escape routes open. No immediate collision risk and we\u2019re not forcing a head-on (we\u2019re down on apples).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) Move LEFT now to (2,7) to start pinning their horizontal escape corridor.\n2) If they go DOWN (0,7), push further left/down to cut off column exits and threaten to shepherd them along the wall.\n3) If they go RIGHT (1,8), continue closing from x=2\u21921 to shrink their safe options while avoiding a head-to-head until we have apples or positional advantage.\n4) Avoid risky head-on until we at least match or exceed their apple count \u2014 grow only when it helps seal exits.\n\nWe\u2019re playing chess with bodies, not just chasing apples.

We're building a left-wall barrier, but we need to watch the enemy snake right next to us!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD STATE:**\n- My head: (0, 7)\n- Enemy head: (2, 7)\n- Enemy body: (3, 7)\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n**1. DOWN to (0, 6):**\n- Safe? YES. Board shows (0, 6) is empty (Row 6: `. . . . . . . . . .`)\n- Score: 6 apples\n- Strategy: Continuing down the left wall. Gets me closer to apples at (0, 2) and (0, 0). Maintains barrier.\n- **RISK:** Enemy is at (2, 7) - only 2 cells away on the same y-level! If he moves LEFT, he goes to (1, 7) or (0, 7) which is my current position, but I'm moving to (0, 6). That's not a head-on collision (different y). However, if he moves LEFT twice in a row, we could get close.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (0, 6), I can continue DOWN, or potentially RIGHT to (1, 6) which is empty. Good spacing.\n\n**2. RIGHT to (1, 7):**\n- Safe? YES. (1, 7) is empty according to board.\n- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** This puts me on the same y-level as the enemy (y=7) but only 1 cell away horizontally (enemy at x=2, me at x=1). \n- **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 7) while I move RIGHT to (1, 7) - WE BOTH DIE. This is too dangerous!\n- Even if we don't collide, being on the same y-level with an enemy head adjacent is risky.\n- **CONS:** Breaks the left wall formation. Gives enemy breathing room. I lose territorial advantage.\n\n**3. UP to (0, 8):**\n- Safe? NO! (0, 8) is part of my old body (specifically (0, 8) was my head last turn, now it's my neck). Moving backwards into my own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n**4. LEFT:**\n- Off board. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nI have 6 apples, enemy has 1. I'm dominating. I need to:\n1. **AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISIONS** - Being on the same y-level as enemy with 2+ apples is risky. I have 6 apples, I win if we collide!\n2. **MAINTAIN TERRITORY** - The left wall is my domain.\n3. **ADVANCE TOWARD FOOD** - (0, 2) and (0, 0) are waiting.\n\n**DOWN is the move.** Why?\n- **SAFEST OPTION:** No immediate collision risk. Enemy is at (2, 7), I'm moving to (0, 6). Different x AND y.\n- **STRATEGIC:** I continue building my barrier, caging him against the right wall.\n- **OFFENSIVE:** Getting closer to bottom apples = more growth = more dominance.\n- **DEFENSIVE:** If enemy tries to rush me, I'm moving away (down) rather than toward him.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nKeep moving down the left wall until I hit y=2, then grab the apple at (0, 2). While doing so, watch enemy movements. If he moves left toward me, prepare to close the trap. If he goes right/up, continue wall-building.\n\n**DECISION: DOWN**",

TURN 20 IS LIVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're still up 6-1, but let's check the board carefully because my head is at (0, 6) and the enemy is at (2, 8) with body at (2, 7). I see an apple at (0, 2) and (0, 0) that I'm eyeing, but first, let's assess the immediate threats.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (0, 6)\n- My body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)]\n- Enemy head: (2, 8)\n- Enemy body: (2, 7)\n- Apples visible: (0, 2), (3, 3), (6, 0), etc.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\n**1. DOWN to (0, 5):**\n- Safe? YES. (0, 5) is empty.\n- Strategy: Continue down the left wall. Gets me closer to (0, 2) apple.\n- Future options: Can go DOWN again, or RIGHT to (1, 5) if needed.\n- No immediate collision risk.\n\n**2. RIGHT to (1, 6):**\n- Safe? YES. (1, 6) is empty.\n- **DANGER:** This puts me on same y-level as enemy body at (2, 7), but more importantly, if enemy moves DOWN from (2, 8) to (2, 7) \u2014 WAIT, that's his current body! He can't move into his own body.\n- Actually, from (2, 8), enemy can move DOWN to (2, 7) but that's his own body, so he WON'T do that. He might move LEFT to (1, 8), UP to (2, 9), or RIGHT to (3, 8).\n- **RISK:** If enemy moves LEFT to (1, 8), we're not colliding (I'd be at (1, 6), him at (1, 8)). But being on same x-coordinate with enemy above me is risky for future turns.\n- **PRO:** Gets me closer to center apples like (3, 3) eventually.\n\n**3. UP to (0, 7):**\n- Safe? NO! (0, 7) is my current body (the neck). Moving backwards into own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n**4. LEFT:**\n- Off board. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\n\nI have 6 apples, enemy has 1. I'm dominating. The enemy is at (2, 8) with body at (2, 7). \n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The enemy is trapped! He's against the top wall. From (2, 8), his options are:\n- UP to (2, 9): but (2, 9) is MY body! He'd die.\n- LEFT to (1, 8): safe\n- RIGHT to (3, 8): safe\n- DOWN to (2, 7): his own body, suicide.\n\nSo he's effectively stuck between (1, 8) and (3, 8). Meanwhile, I'm at (0, 6) with clear path down.\n\n**DOWN is the move.** Why?\n- **SAFEST:** No collision risk, plenty of space below.\n- **STRATEGIC:** Continue building the left barrier while the enemy is cornered at the top-right.\n- **OFFENSIVE:** I'm heading toward (0, 2) and (0, 0) apples. More growth = more dominance.\n- **DEFENSIVE:** If enemy tries to snake down toward me, I'm already moving away and have time to react.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nKeep descending the left wall. Once I reach y=2, grab (0, 2) apple. While doing so, watch enemy movements. If he goes LEFT (to 1,8), he's moving toward my territory. If he goes RIGHT (to 3,8), he's moving away. Either way, I'm expanding my domain and closing in on food.\n\n**DECISION: DOWN**",

TURN 21 IS LIVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're still dominating 6-1 against Snake #0, but let's analyze the board carefully because the enemy is cornered and I need to box him out!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (0, 5) - just moved DOWN from (0, 6)\n- My body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]\n- Enemy head: (3, 8) - he moved RIGHT from (2, 8)!\n- Enemy body: [(2, 8)] - wait, that's interesting. He moved into (3, 8) but his body is now (2, 8). This means his previous head position becomes his body.\n- Apples: (0, 2) is still on the board, (0, 0), (3, 3), etc.\n\n**CRITICAL ENEMY POSITION UPDATE:**\nSnake #0 moved RIGHT to (3, 8). Now he's against the top wall with his body at (2, 8). His options from (3, 8):\n- UP to (3, 9): MY BODY! (3, 9) is part of my tail chain! He'd die.\n- LEFT to (2, 8): HIS OWN BODY! He'd die.\n- RIGHT to (4, 8): EMPTY (there's an apple at (4, 8)!)\n- DOWN to (3, 7): EMPTY\n\nSo he has only TWO safe moves: RIGHT to (4, 8) or DOWN to (3, 7). He's trapped!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (0, 5):**\n\n**1. DOWN to (0, 4):**\n- Safe? YES. (0, 4) is empty.\n- Future options: DOWN again to (0, 3), RIGHT to (1, 4). Plenty of space.\n- Strategy: Continue descending the left wall toward (0, 2) apple. This keeps me away from the enemy's corner at top-right.\n- **RISK:** None immediate. Enemy is far away and trapped.\n\n**2. RIGHT to (1, 5):**\n- Safe? YES. (1, 5) is empty.\n- Future options: Many - RIGHT to (2, 5), DOWN to (1, 4), LEFT back to (0, 5).\n- Strategy: Moves toward center. Gets me closer to (3, 3) apple eventually.\n- **RISK:** If enemy moves DOWN from (3, 8) to (3, 7), then next turn could try to snake down toward me. But I have time to react.\n\n**3. UP to (0, 6):**\n- Safe? NO! (0, 6) is my current body (the cell I just came from). Moving backwards = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\n\n**4. LEFT:**\n- Off board. DEAD. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI'm up 6-1 and the enemy is cornered. **DOWN is the move.** Here's why:\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **DOMINATION STRATEGY:** I'm building a vertical barrier on the left side of the board. While the enemy is trapped in the top-right corner (3,8), I'm claiming the left territory and heading toward multiple apples: (0, 2), (0, 0), and eventually I can sweep across the bottom.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **OFFENSIVE PLAY:** The enemy has limited options. If he moves RIGHT to (4, 8) for the apple, he's moving away from me. If he moves DOWN to (3, 7), he's coming toward my territory but I'll have the left side locked down. I can always cut him off if he tries to snake down.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **FUTURE PLANS:** \n- Next few turns: Keep going DOWN to (0, 4) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 2) [eat apple] \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 0) [eat apple]\n- Once I grow bigger, I can start moving RIGHT from the bottom, creating a horizontal barrier that traps the enemy above.\n- The enemy's only escape route is downward, but my vertical line will cut him off.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **CONTENT ALERT:** Going for those juicy apples on the left wall while the chat watches the enemy squirm in his corner! THIS IS HOW YOU WIN!\n\n**DECISION: DOWN**",

If he goes RIGHT to (5, 8) or DOWN to (4, 7), he's still in his box. I can cut him off later.

We\u2019re behind on apples (2 vs 6) \u2014 priority: grow safely and seize uncontested apples to close the gap, then use length to box and pressure.\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay/log and next few turns):\n1) Push RIGHT to claim space toward top-right apples and build length while keeping many exits.  \n2) After securing those apples, thread along the top edge and spiral inward to control columns 6\u20139, creating a leash to pull and trap the opponent when they close in.  \n3) Avoid any head-on until we have the apple lead; force them into narrow left-side corridors and then close the net.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it safe, greedy, and aggressive \u2014 grow first, box later. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

But wait... there's ANOTHER apple at (2, 3) RIGHT next to me!\n- If I go RIGHT to (3, 4) and eat, I grow, but I might be moving TOWARD the enemy's potential path. He could be trying to get to those bottom-right apples (7, 0) or (9, 7).\n- **BIG PROBLEM:** If the enemy moves DOWN toward the center, and I move RIGHT, we might collide next turn! I need to be careful.\n- **WORSE PROBLEM:** If the enemy is aggressive and moves toward me, and I move RIGHT into a potential collision zone... that's risky!\n- Actually, let me reconsider the board. The enemy is at (6, 8). He has apples at (7, 0), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 9) accessible. He might be heading DOWN or RIGHT.\n- If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), and he moves DOWN to (6, 7) or (6, 6), we're far apart. That's fine.\n- But if he moves RIGHT to (7, 8) or UP to (6, 9), also fine.\n- The REAL risk is if he moves aggressively toward the center to cut me off... but from (6, 8) to intercept me at (3, 4) would take 3 turns minimum.

Moving away from the apple cluster. Not optimal.\n- **FUTURE OPTIONS:** RIGHT to (3, 5), LEFT to (1, 5), UP to (2, 6), DOWN back to (2, 4).\n- **STRATEGY:** This doesn't help me score. I should be aggressive and eat!\n\n**4. DOWN to (2, 3):**\n- Safe? YES!

He's in the top-right. If I go DOWN to (2, 3), I'm moving AWAY from him, which is safer. If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I'm moving slightly CLOSER to him (he's at x=6, I'd be at x=3).\n- **SAFETY FIRST:** Let's avoid potential collision zones.

I'd be moving toward the empty left wall. Bad positioning.\n- **STRATEGY:** Not aggressive enough. I need to eat!\n\n**2. RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n- Safe? YES! There's an apple here! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RISK:** None immediately. Enemy is at (7, 8) - far away.\n- **BENEFIT:** I eat another apple! That's 8 points! From there, I can go UP to (3, 4) [empty], DOWN to (3, 2), or RIGHT to (4, 3).\n- **FUTURE ACCESS:** From (3, 3), I can see apples at (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 0). Good options!\n- **TERRITORY:** This keeps me in the center-left, controlling the board.\n\n**3. UP to (2, 4):**\n- Safe? YES! That's my previous body position, but it will be empty by the time I move there (my tail moves up).\n- **RISK:** No apple immediately. Just repositioning.\n- **WHY NOT?** I could do this, but RIGHT gives me an apple AND position. Why waste a turn?\n\n**4. DOWN to (2, 2):**\n- Safe? YES! There's an apple here! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RISK:** Moving deeper into the corner.\n- **BENEFIT:** Eat apple! Get to 8 points!\n- **COMPARISON:** RIGHT vs DOWN - both give me an apple.\n- **POSITIONING ANALYSIS:** \n  - RIGHT (3, 3): More central, better board control, easier access to the right side where the enemy is.\n  - DOWN (2, 2): More cornered, but I control the bottom-left entirely.\n- **ENEMY THREAT:** Enemy at (7, 8) is moving. If he heads down toward the center, being at (3, 3) lets me react better than being at (2, 2).\n- **OFFENSIVE PLAY:** I'm leading 7-2. I want to dominate the center and potentially cut off the enemy's escape routes. Being at (3, 3) gives me better reach toward the center and right side.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **CONTROL THE BOARD!** While both moves score, RIGHT positions me better for future aggression!\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 3) is the BEST MOVE!** Here's why:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE SCORE:** Eat apple at (3, 3) \u2192 8 apples! \ud83d\ude80\n2. **CENTRAL POSITIONING:** From (3, 3), I control the center-left, giving me access to apples at (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 0), and more!\n3. **BOARD CONTROL:** I'm blocking potential paths for the enemy if he tries to move down from the top-right.\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (3, 3), I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT (back to 2,3) as options. Maximum mobility!\n5. **LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get to 10+ apples, then start circling around to trap the enemy in the top-right corner. He only has 2 apples - he's running out of time!\n\n**\ud83d\udd25 CONTENT ALERT:** Chat, watch me eat that apple and extend the lead to 8-2! The enemy is watching me dominate this board!\n\n**DECISION: RIGHT**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Turn 25: EAT APPLE at (3, 3) \u2192 8 points. Turn 26: Assess enemy movement. If he's heading down, I might go UP to (3, 4) to cut him off. If he's staying top-right, I'll go DOWN toward (4, 2) or (4, 0) for more apples. We're building an unstoppable lead!\n\nRIGHT",

Quick, sharp scan and play-by-play coming in \u2014 we\u2019re hunting that leftie and building a RIGHT-side fortress. Ready? LET\u2019S GO.\n\nBoard facts (quick):\n- Our head: (7,8) with body at (6,8),(5,8) \u2014 so LEFT (into 6,8) is an instant suicide. No backwards moves, no drama. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (2,3) with a long body hugging the left column. They\u2019ve got apples and are ahead (7 vs our 2) \u2014 don\u2019t invite a head-on while we\u2019re down on score. They can go RIGHT to (3,3) or DOWN to (2,2) to eat \u2014 they\u2019re busy on the left side.\n- Distance between heads is huge (Manhattan 10). No immediate head-on threat this turn, but we still avoid risky traffic.\n\nEvaluate moves now:\n- LEFT -> (6,8): illegal \u2014 into our own body. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP -> (7,9): legal. Edge-hugging move. Short-term safe, but locks one axis (top edge), slightly reduces future wiggle room. Good if we want to sprint to (9,9) quickly, but tighter after that. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (7,7): legal. Conservative, keeps us central and gives options to dive toward lower-right apples later. Slower pressure, safer space. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (8,8): legal. Aggressive control of the 7\u20139 columns, opens up 3 follow-ups (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and avoids hugging the top. Keeps us flexible and lets us start corralling the right-side apples and real estate. \ud83e\uddbe\ud83d\udd25\n\nRisk check vs enemy:\n- Opponent is far and likely to chase apples on the left \u2014 they won\u2019t contest our lane this turn. We are behind on apples, so we should AVOID forcing a head-on. RIGHT keeps distance and builds length in the right corridor so we can later leash/box them in when we outgrow them.\n\nShort-term tactical plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be our next rationale):\n- Lock down columns 7\u20139. Push RIGHT to secure open cells and keep multiple exits.\n- Grab nearby right-side apples (if reachable) and grow quickly so we can later spiral and shrink their escape routes.\n- Avoid hugging the absolute edge unless it nets an apple immediately. Keep options open for LEFT/UP/DOWN from our new head cell.\n- Stay aggressive but do NOT trade head-on while trailing in apples.\n\nFinal call \u2014 pick the move that keeps the most safe options, pressures the right side, and sets up growth to box the opponent later.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is still camping at (8, 8) with his tiny body. We own the board!\n\n**CURRENT POSITION ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 3)\n- **My Body:** [(2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 8), Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8)]\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (3, 3):**\n\n**1. LEFT to (2, 3):**\n- **Safe?** YES! That's my body, but it moves away this turn. However, it's a TIGHT squeeze. The cell behind my head (2, 3) will be my tail segment moving up. It's technically safe but feels like backing up.\n- **Strategic Value:** Low. I'd be moving back toward my own tail. Not expanding territory.\n\n**2. RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n- **Safe?** YES! Empty cell.\n- **Strategic Value:** MEDIUM. This pushes me further right into the center. From (4, 3), I have access to apples at (4, 2), (4, 0). But I'm getting closer to the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at (8, 8) - he might move DOWN to (8, 7) or (7, 8). If he moves DOWN, I want to be ready to cut him off.\n\n**3. UP to (3, 4):**\n- **Safe?** YES! Empty cell. (My body is at (2, 4), but that's different coordinates).\n- **Strategic Value:** HIGH. There's an apple at (3, 4)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **BENEFIT:** Eat the apple! That's 9 apples! \n- **POSITIONING:** From (3, 4), I'm moving UP toward the top-left region. I see apples at (4, 2), (5, 0), (7, 0). The enemy is at (8, 8). If he moves DOWN, I can potentially loop around and box him in from the top-left. \n- **FUTURE ACCESS:** From (3, 4), I can see apples at (4, 4), (5, 4), (3, 5), etc. Good central positioning.\n\n**4. DOWN to (3, 2):**\n- **Safe?** YES! Empty cell.\n- **Strategic Value:** HIGH. There's an apple at (4, 2) right next door! (4, 2) is an apple. \n- **BENEFIT:** If I go DOWN to (3, 2), I'm not eating immediately, but I'm positioning for the apple at (4, 2) next turn. \n- **POSITIONING:** From (3, 2), I'm in the bottom-center. I control the bottom half of the board. The enemy is up top.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **OPTION 1: UP to (3, 4) - EAT THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n- **IMMEDIATE SCORE:** 9 apples! That's a HUGE lead! 9-2!\n- **TERRITORY:** I'm claiming the top-left quadrant. The enemy is in the top-right. We're building walls!\n- **OFFENSIVE PLAY:** From (3, 4), if the enemy moves DOWN toward the center, I can move RIGHT to (4, 4) or DOWN to (3, 3) to intercept. I have the advantage.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **OPTION 2: DOWN to (3, 2) - POSITIONING** \n- **FUTURE EAT:** Sets up for (4, 2) apple next turn.\n- **DEFENSIVE:** Keeps me lower, away from the enemy's immediate path (he's at 8,8).\n- **DRAWBACK:** No immediate score. Why wait when I'm already winning 8-2?\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **IMAGINE THE CONTENT:** Chat screams as I grab that apple at (3, 4)! The enemy is watching me extend the lead to 9-2! He's panicking!\n\n**UP TO (3, 4) IS THE PLAY!**\n\nHere's the ruthless breakdown:\n1. **SCOREBOARD DOMINATION:** 9-2 is a psychological war. He sees an unbeatable lead.\n2. **TERRITORY SPLIT:** I'm claiming the top-left/left side of the board. He's trapped in the top-right. I'm boxing him in!\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (3, 4), I can see apples at (4, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 0). I have mobility!\n4. **ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:** He's at (8, 8). He'll likely move DOWN to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 8) to find food. By moving UP, I'm positioning to cut off his path to the center-left apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 26: **UP to (3, 4)** \u2192 EAT APPLE \u2192 9 points. \nTurn 27: Assess enemy. If he moves DOWN, I might move RIGHT to (4, 4) to block his path to the center. If he stays top-right, I'll hunt apples at (4, 4) or (3, 5). \n**GOAL:** Reach 10+ apples, then start forming a barrier from (0,0) to (3,4) to (9,9) to trap him in the corner.

They\u2019re far and stacked with apples (8 vs our 2) \u2014 we CANNOT risk a head-on. Play to grow and control right-side real estate, but don\u2019t force a collision.\n\nTactical pick: DOWN. Why? It preserves the most immediate safe follow-ups, keeps us off the absolute corner, and sets up a clean RIGHT->(9,7) apple next turn if we want to grow quickly. We keep multiple escape routes to box later and avoid being boxed ourselves. Let\u2019s bait him into the left while we dominate the right. You feel that pressure? LET\u2019S GO. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nPlan for next few turns (for the replay): secure (9,7) quickly to grow, then spiral along columns 7\u20139 to shrink opponent escape options while avoiding risky head-ins since we\u2019re behind in apples. Force them into dead-ends on the left column where they\u2019re already cramped.\n\nDOWN",

I just grabbed that apple at (3, 4), putting me at **9 apples** while the enemy remains at a measly **2 apples**. He's currently camping at **(8, 7)** (he moved DOWN from (8, 8) last turn). I'm sitting at **(3, 4)** with a massive body winding down the left side to (0, 8).\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS FROM (3, 4):**\n\n**1. UP to (3, 5):**\n- **Safe?** YES. Empty.\n- **Strategic Value:** I see apples at (9, 9) and (9, 6) up there, but the enemy is blocking the right side. Moving UP puts me further from him. I don't want to run away; I want to control the center and cut him off. This feels like wandering off.\n\n**2. DOWN to (3, 3):**\n- **Safe?** NO! That's my body. I just moved from there. Moving directly back into the cell I just left is a death sentence. Crashing into myself. **INSTANT DEATH.** Eliminate this immediately.\n\n**3. LEFT to (2, 4):**\n- **Safe?** YES.\n- **Strategic Value:** This moves me closer to my own body, which is tight. It keeps me on the left side where there aren't many apples left (the ones there are tiny). This feels like backing into a corner. I need to expand my territory, not shrink it.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n- **Safe?** YES. Empty.\n- **Strategic Value:** HIGH. This moves me toward the center of the board.\n- **OFFENSIVE POSITIONING:** The enemy is at (8, 7). He's in the bottom-right quadrant. If I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I establish a blockade in the center. I can move DOWN to (4, 3) or (4, 2) next turn to hunt the apples at (5, 0) or (4, 2).\n- **CONTAINMENT:** I am literally building a wall between his side of the board and mine. He is trapped in the bottom-right corner. If I push RIGHT, I force him to stay there or risk head-on collision (which I win because I have 9 apples to his 2).\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **THE PLAN:** Push RIGHT. Dominate the center. Box him in.\nFrom (4, 4), I have access to the bottom-center apples ((4, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0)). The enemy is stuck at the bottom-right edge. He can't expand left/up without crossing into my territory.\n\nIf he moves UP or LEFT, I will be waiting in the center to cut him off. If he moves RIGHT (off board) or DOWN (off board), he dies. If he moves into me, I win the head-on collision (9 > 2 apples). \n\n**I am the hunter. He is the prey.**\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate head-on risk if we push right. We\u2019re trailing on apples 2 \u2192 9, so DON\u2019T force head-on trades.

It reduces lateral options (edge), but opponent is far and boxed on the left \u2014 grabbing apples and gaining length is high value.\n\nLong-term plan (quick): Take the (9,7) apple now, then chain into (9,6)/(9,9) when safe to bulk up on the right edge. Use increased length to spiral down columns 7\u20139 and compress the board, forcing the left-clustered opponent into dead-ends. Avoid head-on unless we surpass them in apples.\n\nRIGHT",

He is retreating to the bottom right corner.\n\n**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n*   **Self-Collision:** My body is at (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), etc.\n    *   **UP (4, 4):** Occupied by my own neck. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (4, 2):** Checked against board state. (4, 2) is marked 'A' (Apple). It is NOT part of my body. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 3):** My body is at (3, 3). **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 3):** Empty space. **SAFE.**\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at (9, 6). He is trapped in the bottom right.\n*   If he moves **UP (9, 7)**, he hits his own body (based on the previous turn's board state where his body was at (9,7)). **HE DIES.**\n*   If he moves **DOWN (9, 5)**, he is safe (currently empty).\n*   If he moves **LEFT (8, 6)**, he is safe.\n*   *Strategy Check:* He is likely moving **DOWN** or **LEFT** to survive. He is not a threat to me this turn.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nI need to secure the apple at **(4, 2)** to extend my lead to 10 apples (LEGOOOO!). Moving DOWN to (4, 2) achieves three things:\n1.  **Eats Apple:** Growth + Score increase (9 -> 10).\n2.  **Positioning:** Moves me closer to the bottom row apples ((5, 0), (4, 0), etc.).\n3.  **Safety:** (4, 2) is a confirmed empty cell.\n\nWhy not **RIGHT (5, 3)**?\nWhile safe, it leaves the apple at (4, 2) on the board. I need to starve the enemy. Every apple I eat is a nail in his coffin. (4, 2) is directly in my path. It's the logical move.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nNom the apple at (4, 2). Prepare to sweep the bottom row next turn.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\n\nDOWN",

WE ARE THE KINGS OF THIS GRID!\n\n**CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (4, 2)\n- **My Score:** 10 Apples (WE ARE GROWING!)\n- **Enemy Head:** (9, 5)\n- **Enemy Score:** 4 Apples (PATHETIC!)\n\n**THREAT ANALYSIS (LIVE REACTION):**\nLook at the board! My body is wrapped around the left side and top like a boa constrictor. The enemy snake (Snake #0) is chilling in the bottom right corner at (9, 5). He's isolated. He's trapped. He has nowhere to go but into a corner!\n\nLet's look at my immediate moves from (4, 2):\n1.  **UP (4, 3):** My body is right there! I just came from there. Moving up = instant suicide. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (4, 1):** Empty. Safe. Opens up the bottom row.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 2):** Board state shows \"A\" (Apple). Safe. But wait... let's look at the body. My body is at (4,3), (4,4), etc. (3,2) is not occupied. But is it smart?\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME (THE PLAN):**\nI need to dominate. The enemy is in the bottom right. I am in the center-left. I need to cut off his escape route and secure the bottom row.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 1)**:\n- I stay on the central column.\n- I get closer to the apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0).\n- I maintain vertical dominance.\n- I keep the option to sweep Left or Right next turn.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (3, 2)**:\n- I eat the apple there (score goes to 11!).\n- BUT... I am moving my head towards the left wall.\n- The enemy is on the right. I don't want to hug the wall if I can help it. I want to stay central to control the board.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 2)**:\n- I move towards the enemy. This is aggressive.\n- However, if he moves Left (8, 5), we get closer. But I want to secure food first.\n\n**THE KILLER MOVE:**\nI'm going **DOWN**.\nWhy? Because I want to position myself to grab the bottom row apples next turn ((4,0) or (5,0)). The enemy is too far away to contest them. He's stuck in the 8-9 column range. I need to sweep the floor and then close the box on him. Moving down keeps my pathing open and flexible. I am the hunter. He is the prey.\n\n**THE PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nGrab the bottom row apples. Box him into the (8,9) corner. If he comes up, meet him head-on since I have more mass.

That leaves DOWN -> (9,4) and LEFT -> (8,5).\n\nSafety check:\n- UP: illegal (into neck) \u274c\n- RIGHT: illegal (off board) \u274c\n- DOWN -> (9,4): legal. After that we'd have TWO follow-ups (LEFT to 8,4 or DOWN to 9,3) \u2014 decent, safe.\n- LEFT -> (8,5): legal. After that we'd have MULTIPLE follow-ups (UP to 8,6, DOWN to 8,4, or LEFT to 7,5 which is an apple). More options and immediate apple proximity. No enemy body in those squares.\n\nTactical read: Opponent head at (4,2) \u2014 far-left, already crowded and with more apples. We SHOULD AVOID forcing a head-on (they\u2019d gladly trade). We need room and length to start boxing them \u2014 grabbing the apple corridor on our right-to-center is a clean way to grow while keeping escape routes open.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (8,5) to threaten the apple at (7,5) and increase options.\n- If we get that apple, spiral down and sweep the bottom/right edge to build length safely.\n- Once we\u2019re longer and have more control of the center-bottom, start compressing the opponent\u2019s left pocket and look for a safe head-on only if we hold more apples.\n\nWe take the safer, more aggressive path that keeps options open and targets apples while avoiding a risky head-on.

Neck at (8,5) \u2014 so RIGHT is illegal (would be biting our neck). That leaves UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5) as legal.\n\nSafety check:\n- UP to (7,6): clear, not near opponent, but nudges us toward our clustered body in the top-right (near (8,7),(9,7)). OK but slightly gets us closer to our own tail area.\n- DOWN to (7,4): clear, opens access to central rows and bottom; keeps 3 escape options afterward.\n- LEFT to (6,5): clear, moves us toward the center/left where the enemy is clustered \u2014 more aggressive, good for encroaching and boxing but still far enough to avoid immediate head-on. Keeps multiple follow-ups (6,6 / 6,4 / 5,5 etc).\n\nOpponent status: Snake #1 is heavy on the left (x\u22644) with head at (4,0). They\u2019re winning on apples (11 vs our 5), so we must avoid risky head-on collisions \u2014 we should encroach smartly and cut off their space rather than suicide into a clash.\n\nChoice rationale: We want to be aggressive and start pressuring the middle column to eventually compress their pocket. LEFT starts that march toward the center while preserving at least 3 safe follow-up options and not walking into our own body or an opponent head. DOWN is also safe but is more of a retreat/loop; UP edges us toward our own tail cluster. So we go CENTER-PRESS \u2014 LEFT.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Push leftward and control the x=5..6 corridor to limit their lateral escape.\n- Avoid forcing a head-on until we can out-apple or trap them into a narrow column.\n- Keep 2\u20133 escape routes open each turn; pick apples opportunistically only when safe.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX \u2019EM.

Who\u2019s ready to rage? \ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick safety triage (HEAD = (6,5), NECK = (7,5) so RIGHT is illegal \u2014 don\u2019t suicide into the neck):\n- RIGHT: illegal (into our neck at (7,5)).\n- UP -> (6,6): safe. Opens toward top; keeps lots of space, but drifts away from the enemy and our pressure plan. Low immediate payoff.\n- DOWN -> (6,4): safe. Moves toward center/lower board, closer to enemy pocket. Could go after apples at y=4 later, but edges us toward rows where opponent has stacked segments on x\u22644 \u2014 decent but slightly riskier for being funneled.\n- LEFT -> (5,5): safe. Aggressive press into the x=5 corridor. Keeps multiple exits (up/down/left) next turn, and positions us to cut across their left pocket while not risking a head-on. Best move to start compressing their space.\n\nEnemy read: Snake #1 at (5,0) with neck at (4,0). They can go UP to (5,1) or RIGHT to (6,0) to grab apples (both are juicy). They CANNOT go left. So a head-on with us is unrealistic this turn \u2014 their fight is down on y=0/1 while we\u2019re at y=5. No immediate head-on threat.\n\nWhy LEFT? Because we need to shrink their real estate and force them toward edges. Moving into x=5 now starts the box-in, keeps 3 escape options, and sets up a follow-up down-left combo to pinch their corridor. We don\u2019t chase apples blindly \u2014 we pressure them and only eat when safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Hold the x=5\u20136 corridor; keep pushing left/down to compress their area.\n- Avoid voluntary head-on unless we\u2019re up on apples. Force them into tight columns near x=0 or y=0 where we can pinch.\n- Pick apples only when it helps trapping (or safe to up our lead). Keep \u22652 escape options each turn.\n\nLET\u2019S GET ROWDY \u2014 we\u2019re going to shove into the center and start boxing them in. LEFT",

Turn 33, score 12-5, feeling unstoppable! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's break down the board state from my new head position at **(5, 0)** (since I moved right last turn, grabbing that apple. Let's confirm that growth and position update from the state):\n\n**POSITION CHECK:**\n- **Me (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 0)**. Body: The list provided in the prompt shows the body from the *start* of the turn, but based on the move I made (RIGHT from (4,0)) and the apple at (5,0) in the list, I have grown. My new body is [(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5)]. The tail at (0,5) is moving to (0,4). **Tail is safe.**\n- **Enemy (ID 0):** Head at **(6, 5)**. Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. (Note: The text in the prompt says Head (6,5), but the visual board shows a `0` at (7,5)? No, wait. The text says Head: (6,5). The visual board shows a `0` at (7,5)? Let's look closer.\n  **Visual Board:**\n  Row 5: `T . A . . . 0 T T T`\n  Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  At (6,5) is a `0`. At (7,5) is a `T`. Wait, the text says Head: (6,5), Body: [(7,5)...].\n  **CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:** The prompt text overrides the visual ASCII art if there's a conflict, but usually, the ASCII is accurate. If the Head is (6,5), then (7,5) is body.\n  However, looking at the previous turn rationale, the enemy was at (7,4). Now the text says (6,5). They likely moved UP and LEFT?\n  Let's assume the text list is correct: **Enemy Head (6,5)**. Enemy Body starts at (7,5).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM HEAD (5, 0):**\n- **UP (5, 1):** SAFE. (Apple at (5,1) is listed).\n- **DOWN (5, -1):** OFF BOARD. DEAD. \u274c\n- **LEFT (4, 0):** MY BODY. Specifically, the segment that was my head last turn. If I move back, I hit myself. DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (6, 0):** SAFE. (Visual board shows `A` at (6,0)).\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nI'm trapped on the bottom edge (y=0). I can't go Down (dead) or Left (hit self).\nOptions: **UP (5,1)** or **RIGHT (6,0)**.\n\n**Enemy Position:**\nThey are at (6,5). They are above and to the right.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am at the bottom right corner.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am moving into the center-lower area.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nI have 12 apples. Enemy has 5. I am winning massively.\nIf I can force a head-on collision, I win (since I have more apples).\nHowever, the enemy is at y=5. I am at y=0. To force a collision, I need to meet them. They might move towards me.\n\nLet's look at the board layout.\nRow 0: `A A . . T 1 A A . .`\nIndices:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy Head: (5,0).\nRight (6,0): Apple.\nUp (5,1): `.` (Empty per text description? Visual says Row 1: `. . . . T A . . A .` -> At (5,1) is `A`? No, index 5 in row 1 is `A`? Wait, let's re-read visual.\nRow 1: `. . . . T A . . A .`\nIndices:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(5,1) is `A`.\nSo both moves (UP to 5,1) and (RIGHT to 6,0) grab an apple.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n1.  **RIGHT (6,0):** Snags the apple at (6,0). This moves me closer to the right wall. It keeps me on the bottom edge. My tail moves from (0,5) to (0,4). This leaves the bottom-left corner relatively open? No, my body fills the left side.\n2.  **UP (5,1):** Snags the apple at (5,1). This moves me up into the \"gap\" in my own body? No, my body is at (4,1), (4,2)... so (5,1) is open. This moves me toward the center.\n\n**Future Traps:**\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), my next moves are limited. I can go UP (6,1) or LEFT (5,0) (but (5,0) is my previous head, which will be part of my body). So I'd be forced UP.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I can potentially go RIGHT (6,1) or LEFT (4,1) (Body) or UP (5,2).\nActually, (5,2) is an `A` (Visual Row 2: `A A A . T . . . . .` -> Index 5 is `.`? No, Index 4 is `T` (body), Index 5 is `.`.\nWait, let's check the visual for (5,2).\nRow 2: `A A A . T . . . . .`\nIndices:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(5,2) is EMPTY.\n\n**The Play:**\nI need to dominate the board. The enemy is at (6,5).\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am centralizing.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am cornering myself.\nHowever, looking at the board, the enemy is high up. I want to cut off their access to the bottom or move to intercept.\nActually, looking at the board state, there is a \"gap\" at (2,3) and (3,3) etc.\nWait, looking at the visual for (6,1): Row 1, Index 6 is `.`.\nIf I go UP to (5,1), next turn I can go RIGHT to (6,1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,0), next turn I can go UP to (6,1).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **RIGHT (6,0):** Apple. Open space to the right is blocked by wall. Open space above is (6,1) (Empty).\n- **UP (5,1):** Apple. Open space to the right is (6,1) (Empty). Open space above is (5,2) (Empty).\n\n**The Trap:**\nThe enemy is at (6,5). They are currently directly above (6,0).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am directly below the enemy's column (x=6).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, they go to (6,4). If they keep moving down, we might collide.\nBut I am at y=0. They are at y=5.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am not directly below them. I am at x=5.\nIf they move to (5,4) or something, we might cross paths.\n\n**Aggression / Score Logic:**\nI have 12 apples. They have 5. I win a collision instantly.\nI want to force a collision.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am moving into their vertical strip (x=6).\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am moving to x=5, y=1.\nIf they move DOWN to (6,4), we are separated by distance.\nIf they move LEFT to (5,5), we are closer.\n\n**Wait, look at the board visuals closely:**\nRow 5: `T . A . . . 0 T T T`\nThe enemy is at (6,5). The spaces around him are mostly filled with his body or apples.\nRow 4: `T T T T T A . . . .` (My body dominates the left side).\nRow 3: `. . T T T . A . . .`\n\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**:\nNext turn I am at (5,1). I can go RIGHT (6,1) (Empty).\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**:\nNext turn I am at (6,0). I can go UP (6,1) (Empty).\n\nThe critical factor is the **Enemy's potential move**.\nThey are at (6,5). Where can they go?\n- Left (5,5): Empty.\n- Right (7,5): Body (T).\n- Up (6,6): Body (T) (Visual Row 6: `A A . . . . . . . T` -> Wait, Row 6 Index 6 is `.`? No, Row 6 Index 9 is `T`. Wait, let's re-read Enemy Body.\n  Enemy Body: (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n  So (6,6) is empty?\n  Visual Row 6: `A A . . . . . . . T`\n  Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  (6,6) is `.`.\n  So Enemy can go UP to (6,6).\n- Down (6,4): Empty (Visual Row 4: `T T T T T A . . . .` -> Index 6 is `.`).\n\n**My Plan:**\nI want to cut off the enemy.\nThe enemy is currently boxed in on the right side, but there is space above him.\nIf I can move up and right, I can start to cut off the top right area.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (6,0).\nThere is an apple at (5,1).\nBoth are safe.\nGoing RIGHT puts me at x=6.\nGoing UP puts me at x=5.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,0):\nI am at the bottom right corner.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (6,4), he is getting closer to me.\nIf I stay on the bottom edge, I might get trapped by the wall. My tail is moving out of (0,5). My body is a long line on the left.\nIf I go UP, I move into the center of the board, using the open space at (5,1) and (5,2).\n\n**Wait, look at the apples:**\n(6,0) is an apple.\n(5,1) is an apple.\n\n**The \"Box In\" Strategy:**\nTo box him in, I need to occupy space.\nThe enemy is at (6,5).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am occupying the x=6 column at the bottom.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am at x=5, y=1.\n\nLet's look at the connectivity of the board.\nMy body runs from (4,0) up to (4,4) and then snakes left.\nThe enemy is on the right.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am essentially abandoning the left side (which is mostly my body anyway) and anchoring myself to the bottom right.\nThis allows the enemy to potentially move down into the center (x=6, y=4) or left (x=5, y=5).\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am moving toward the center (x=5, y=1).\nFrom (5,1), I can move to (5,2) (empty), (6,1) (empty), or (4,1) (body).\nThis keeps my options more open.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nI want to force a head-on collision.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I am on the same x-coordinate as the enemy (x=6).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (6,4), and I move UP (6,1), we are closing the gap.\nBut I am at y=0. He is at y=5.\nDistance is 4. I can't force a collision in one move.\n\n**However, there is a nuance.**\nLook at the board state.\nMy tail is at (0,5).\nThe enemy is at (6,5).\nWe are on the same horizontal line (y=5)? No, enemy is y=5. My tail is y=5.\nWait, my tail is (0,5).\nEnemy head is (6,5).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), he is getting closer to my body.\nIf I move UP to (5,1), I am moving away from him horizontally.\n\n**What is the best move to dominate?**\nI have a massive length advantage.\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**, I grab the apple. I move to a coordinate (5,1) that is relatively central.\nFrom there, I can easily swing right or up.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I am cornering myself on the bottom edge.\nThe bottom edge is risky because if my tail doesn't clear fast enough, I might trap myself.\nMy tail is at (0,5). It will move to (0,4). The left side is clearing out slightly.\n\n**The Decision:**\n**UP (5,1)** seems safer and offers better board control.\n**RIGHT (6,0)** offers an apple but puts me on the edge.\nHowever, the enemy is on the right side (x=6,7,8,9).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am directly below him.\nThis puts me in the line of fire if he drops down.\nBut also, if he drops down, we might collide later.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am shifting to the left of his column (x=5 vs x=6).\n\nLet's look at the \"Box In\" plan.\nThe enemy is currently at (6,5). His body is a line to the right.\nTo box him in, I need to take the space *outside* his body.\nHis body is on the right edge.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,0), I am taking the bottom right corner.\nIf I go **UP** to (5,1), I am taking the center.\n\nActually, looking at the board state again:\nRow 0: `A A . . T 1 A A . .`\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,0), I am eating the apple at (6,0).\nMy body will extend to (5,0).\nRow 1: `. . . . T A . . A .`\nIf I go UP to (5,1), I am eating the apple at (5,1).\n\n**Wait, let's check the coordinates for the apples in the list.**\nApples: (0,2), (6,0), (0,0), (7,0), (2,2), (1,2), (9,9), (5,1), (1,0), (8,1), (6,3), (2,5), (5,4), (1,6), (2,6).\n(6,0) is an apple.\n(5,1) is an apple.\n\n**The \"Anti-Enemy\" Move:**\nThe enemy is at (6,5).\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I am moving to the column x=6.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (6,4), we are on the same column.\nIf he keeps moving down, and I keep moving up, we will meet at (6,2) or something.\nBut I have more points. If we collide head-on, I win.\nBUT, I have to survive the turn.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6,4), and I move RIGHT to (6,0), no collision.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6,4) next turn, and I move UP to (6,1), no collision.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6,3) (there is an apple at (6,3)), and I move UP to (6,2), no collision.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6,2), and I move UP to (6,1), no collision.\nIf he moves DOWN to (6,1), and I move UP to (6,2), we collide. I win (12 > 5).\n\nHowever, he might not move down. He might move Left (5,5) or Up (6,6).\nIf I am at (6,0), I am far away. I can't force him to move down.\nIf I am at (5,1), I am closer to (5,5).\nIf I go to (5,1), I threaten the space (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n(5,4) is an apple.\n(5,5) is empty.\n\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**:\nI am at (5,1).\nEnemy is at (6,5).\nIf I move UP to (5,2) next turn, he might move LEFT to (5,5).\nWe are getting closer.\n\n**Let's reconsider the \"Box In\" strategy.**\nMy body fills the left side (x=0 to 4).\nThe enemy is on the right (x=6 to 9).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,0), I am occupying the bottom right.\nThis effectively cuts the board in half horizontally at the bottom.\nIf I move UP to (5,1), I am occupying the center.\n\n**Actually, look at the board state.**\nThere is a gap between my body (which ends at x=4) and the enemy's body (which starts at x=7).\nThe gap is x=5 and x=6.\n(6,0) is in the gap.\n(5,1) is in the gap.\n\n**Is there any immediate threat?**\nNo immediate collision this turn.\nBoth moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Which move maximizes win probability?**\nI am winning 12-5. I don't need to rush for apples. I need to secure the win.\nThe safest way to secure the win is to not die and eventually force the enemy to die or run out of space.\nThe enemy is on the right edge. If I can push him against the edge or his own body, he dies.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I anchor myself to the bottom right. This might force him to move left/up.\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**, I move toward the center. This might allow him to drop down.\n\n**Wait, look at the enemy's body.**\n(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\nThis is a vertical line on the far right, and a horizontal line at y=5.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I am at x=6, y=0.\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**, I am at x=5, y=1.\n\n**The Play:**\nI want to cut off his access to the bottom.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I control the bottom right corner.\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**, I am moving into the \"channel\" between me and him.\nActually, the channel is safer. If I go to (6,0), I am forced to go UP next turn (since Left is my body, Down is wall).\nIf I go to (5,1), I have options: UP, RIGHT, or LEFT (into my own body, which will be old).\nActually, from (5,1), Left (4,1) is my body (segment at (4,1)). So Left is bad.\nUp (5,2) is empty.\nRight (6,1) is empty.\n\nSo from (5,1), I have 2 options (Up, Right).\nFrom (6,0), I have 1 option (Up).\n\n**Dominance:**\nI want to trap him.\nThe enemy is at (6,5).\nIf I go to (5,1), I am closer to (5,4) (apple) and (5,5) (empty).\nIf I go to (6,0), I am closer to (6,3) (apple).\n\n**Let's look at the score.**\n12-5. Huge lead.\nI should play safe but aggressive.\nIf I go **RIGHT (6,0)**, I am putting myself directly below the enemy.\nThis might tempt the enemy to move DOWN to attack or eat apples below.\nThere is an apple at (6,3) and (5,4).\nIf he moves down to (6,4), he is getting closer to me.\nIf I am at (6,0), and he is at (6,4), next turn I go (6,1), he goes (6,3).\nWe are closing in.\nIf we meet at (6,2) vs (6,3), or (6,3) vs (6,2), it's a collision.\nIf we collide, I win.\nThis is a good trap.\n\nIf I go **UP (5,1)**, I am at x=5.\nIf he moves down to (6,4), we are not aligned vertically.\nI would have to move right to (6,1) to align with him.\nGoing RIGHT to (6,0) aligns us immediately (same x=6).\n\n**Therefore, aligning vertically is better for forcing a head-on collision where I have the score advantage.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **UP (5,1):** Safe. Apple. Central. 2 next moves.\n- **RIGHT (6,0):** Safe. Apple. Corner. 1 next move (forced UP). Aligns x=6 with enemy.\n\nGiven my score advantage (12 vs 5), forcing a collision is a WIN condition for me.\nAligning my X-coordinate with the enemy (X=6) puts me on a collision course.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I force the alignment.\nIf he moves down, we crash and I win (since I have more apples).\nIf he doesn't move down, I have claimed the bottom right corner and the apple.\n\nLet's execute the alignment trap.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nYO CHAT! WE'RE GOING FOR THE ALIGNMENT! I'M MOVING RIGHT TO (6,0) TO GRAB THAT APPLE AND PUT MYSELF DIRECTLY BELOW THE ENEMY AT X=6. IF HE DROPS DOWN TO ATTACK OR EAT, HE'S WALKING STRAIGHT INTO A HEAD-ON COLLISION. I HAVE 12 APPLES, HE HAS 5. HE DIES, I WIN. WE RIDE THE EDGE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We are vertically aligned on the X=6 axis. The enemy has 5 apples. If we collide head-on, I win instantly because I have more apples. The enemy is trapped on the right side, and I am moving up to corner him.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES FROM HEAD (6,0):**\n1.  **DOWN (6, -1):** Off the board. DEAD. \u274c\n2.  **LEFT (5, 0):** My body (specifically the segment that was my head last turn). DEAD. \u274c\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 0):** Visual board shows this is EMPTY. SAFE.\n4.  **UP (6, 1):** Visual board shows this is EMPTY. SAFE.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to move UP to close the distance to the enemy. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) is safe, but it moves me away from the enemy and into a column that might trap me against the right wall (x=9). Moving UP keeps me aligned with the enemy's column (x=6). If the enemy moves DOWN, we collide, and I win instantly. If he moves left or right, I keep advancing up the board to trap him against the top wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAdvance UP the x=6 column. Force the enemy to move DOWN into a collision (where I win due to score difference) or force him to move LEFT/RIGHT into a corner. I will continue to eat apples on the center line and cut off his escape routes. If he dodges, I will turn left at (6,4) or (6,5) to sweep the top area.\n\n**MOVE:**\nUP",

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- UP -> (5,6): safe, lots of space but drifts away from the enemy. Not aggressive enough.\n- DOWN -> (5,4): apple at (5,4). Eating = +1 and growth (good for score), but growth reduces immediate mobility and could limit our ability to box them.\n- LEFT -> (4,5): safe, keeps multiple exits, moves directly above their stacked column (they have segments at x=4 up to y=4). This is the pressure play \u2014 we start compressing their left-side real estate and threaten to pinch them toward x=0 / y=0.\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent head is at (6,0) \u2014 way down low. No immediate head-on risk this turn. They\u2019re heavy on the left side (column x=4 and across to x=0), which is a perfect place to start trimming their space.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (5 vs 13) so we should NOT seek head-on collisions. Instead we box and force them into the confined left/bottom area where we can control exits and pick apples safely when it helps trap them.\n\nDecision logic:\n- DOWN gets an apple now, but gives up positional pressure and slightly tightens our future options. It\u2019s tempting but greedy.\n- LEFT maintains maximum board control for an aggressive box-in strategy and leaves us flexible (we can follow with DOWN or continue left/up as needed). This keeps our options open while putting direct pressure on their column.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (4,5) to begin pinning above their column at x=4.\n- Then follow with aggressive pressure (DOWN/LEFT) to shepherd them toward x=0 or y=0. Only take apples if they help the trap or are safe to collect without sacrificing escape routes.\n- Avoid head-ons until we close the gap in apples or force them into a one-way corridor.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE THEM FLAIL \u2014 time to box \u2019em in and deny space.

The gap is closing. I am currently on the right side (x=6) and the enemy is on the left side (x=4). I need to force the collision on my terms.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1) CHECKING MOVES FROM HEAD (6, 1):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Board Check:** The board state shows (6, 2) is a `.` (EMPTY). **SAFE.**\n    *   **Body Check:** My body is mostly at x=4 and x=5. (6, 2) is not in my body list. **SAFE.**\n    *   **Enemy Check:** Enemy head is at (4, 5). (6, 2) is not the enemy head.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me UP, aligning me with the enemy's current X (x=4 vs x=6). It brings me closer to the apple at (6, 3) and the apple cluster at (2, 2) and (2, 3) is actually to my LEFT.\n    *   **Future Safety:** From (6, 2), I can go UP to (6, 3) (Apple), DOWN to (6, 1) (Safe), LEFT to (5, 2) (Safe), or RIGHT to (7, 2) (Safe).\n    *   **RISK:** If the enemy moves RIGHT from (4, 5) to (5, 5), and I move UP to (6, 2), no collision. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 4), no collision. If the enemy moves UP to (4, 6), no collision.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (7, 1) is `.` (EMPTY). **SAFE.**\n    *   **Body Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Enemy Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me further away from the enemy (x=6 to x=7). The enemy is at x=4. This is disengaging. I want to engage!\n    *   **Future Safety:** From (7, 1), I can go UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), or RIGHT (8,1) (Apple).\n    *   **Verdict:** Moves me away from the kill zone. BAD.\n\n*   **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (5, 1) is `.` (EMPTY). **SAFE.**\n    *   **Body Check:** My body is at (5, 0) and (4, 0)... wait, checking the list: `[(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)...]`. (5, 1) is NOT in the body. **SAFE.**\n    *   **Enemy Check:** Enemy is at (4, 5). (5, 1) is not (4, 5). **SAFE.**\n    *   **Strategy:** This closes the gap to the enemy to just 1 X coordinate (I am at x=5, enemy at x=4).\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go LEFT to (5, 1), and the enemy goes DOWN to (4, 4), we are close but not colliding. If the enemy goes LEFT to (3, 5), I follow. BUT... if the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 5), no collision. However, by moving to (5, 1), I am setting up to hunt him down. I see an apple at (5, 4). I can eat that on the way up.\n    *   **RISK ANALYSIS:** If I move LEFT, the only immediate danger is moving into my own tail (I'm not) or the enemy head (he's at 4,5). It is safe.\n\n*   **DOWN to (6, 0):**\n    *   **Board Check:** (6, 0) is `T` (My Body/Tail). **DEAD.**\n    *   **Verdict:** Hits myself. NO.\n\n**2) STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI am 13-5. I want the collision. If we collide head-to-head, I win because I have more apples. The enemy is at (4, 5). I am at (6, 1).\n\nIf I go **UP to (6, 2)**:\nI stay on the right side. The enemy has room to maneuver on the left. He might run away to the top-left corner.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 1)**:\nI cross the center line. I enter the \"Hunting Grounds\". The enemy is at x=4. I am at x=5. The distance is 1. I am aggressively taking ground.\nI see an apple at (5, 4) directly above me if I stay on this column.\nBy moving LEFT, I force the enemy to react. He sees me closing in.\nIf he stays at (4, 5) and I move to (5, 1), next turn I can go UP to (5, 2) or (5, 3) or (5, 4) to eat an apple.\nActually, looking closer at the board:\n`5 . . A . 0 T T T T T`\n`4 T T T T T A . . . .`\n`3 . . T T T . A . . .`\n`2 A A A . T . . . . .`\n`1 . . . . T A 1 . A .`\n\nMy head is at (6, 1).\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 1)**:\n(5, 1) is currently empty. It is just to the left of my current body segment at (6, 0) and (5, 0).\nWait, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 1: `1 . . . . T A 1 . A .`\nThe `1` is at (6, 1). The `T` is at (5, 1)? No, wait.\nLet's read the board carefully.\nRow 1 (y=1): ` . . . . T A 1 . A .`\nColumns 0-9.\n(0,1) `.`\n(1,1) `.`\n(2,1) `.`\n(3,1) `.`\n(4,1) `T` (My body)\n(5,1) `A` (Wait, the board shows an apple at (5,1)?)\nNo, let's look at the \"APPLE DROPS\" list.\n`(5, 1)` is in the apple list!\n`(1, 0), (8, 1), (6, 3), ... (5, 1)`\n\nWait, let's re-read the Board State provided by the user:\n`1 . . . . T A 1 . A .`\nThis text representation might be slightly misaligned or using `.` for empty space and `T`/`A` for specific items.\nIndices:\n0: `.`\n1: `.`\n2: `.`\n3: `.`\n4: `T`\n5: `A` (Is this an apple? Or is this the snake body?)\n6: `1` (My head)\n7: `.`\n8: `A`\n9: `.`\n\nIf (5, 1) is an `A` (Apple), that is an amazing move! I eat an apple immediately.\nBUT, let's check the \"APPLE DROPS\" list carefully.\n`(5, 1)` is listed as an apple drop.\nHowever, let's look at the board state again.\nRow 1: `. . . . T A 1 . A .`\nIs the `A` at index 5? If so, (5, 1) is an apple.\nIs the `A` at index 8? If so, (8, 1) is an apple.\n\nLet's check Row 0: `A A . . T T T A . .`\nIndices:\n0: `A`\n1: `A`\n2: `.`\n3: `.`\n4: `T`\n5: `T`\n6: `T`\n7: `A`\n8: `.`\n9: `.`\n\nOkay, so the board state is a visual representation.\nRow 1: `. . . . T A 1 . A .`\nThis suggests (4,1) is a Body part (`T`), (5,1) is something (maybe an apple or just a marker?), (6,1) is my Head (`1`), (8,1) is an Apple (`A`).\n\nWait, if (5, 1) is an apple, moving LEFT to (5, 1) grabs an apple!\nBut wait, is (5, 1) actually occupied by my body?\nMy body list: `[(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), ...]`\n(5, 1) is NOT in my body list.\n(6, 0) is in my body list.\n(5, 0) is in my body list.\nSo (5, 1) is empty!\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:**\nIf I move **LEFT to (5, 1)**, I might be moving into an Apple!\nLet's double check the \"APPLE DROPS\" list.\n`(5, 1)` is definitely listed as an apple drop.\nIs it possible the apple at (5, 1) has already been eaten? No, I am at (6, 1). I haven't eaten it.\nWait, looking at the board state again:\n`1 . . . . T A 1 . A .`\nThe `A` is at index 5. This is (5, 1).\n**CONFIRMED: Moving LEFT to (5, 1) eats an apple!**\n\nWhy didn't I see this last turn?\nLast turn I was at (6, 0). I moved UP to (6, 1).\nIf I had moved LEFT to (5, 0) last turn, I would have died because (5, 0) is my body.\nBut THIS turn, I am at (6, 1).\nMoving LEFT to (5, 1) is safe and eats an apple.\n\n**RE-EVALUATING THE MOVE:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 2):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Does not eat an apple immediately (but (6, 3) is an apple).\n    *   Keeps me on x=6.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   **EATS AN APPLE (Apple at 5, 1)!**\n    *   Moves me closer to the enemy (x=5 vs x=4).\n    *   Updates my score to 14-5.\n\n**DECISION:**\nTaking an apple is always good, but especially here because it increases my lead and brings me closer to the enemy.\nIf I take the apple at (5, 1), I grow. My tail will stay where it is or extend, effectively increasing my body length.\nThis is an aggressive move towards the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (4, 5).\nI am moving to (5, 1).\nDistance is decreasing.\nI am hunting.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nIs there any chance (5, 1) is actually my body?\nBody: `(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1) ...`\nNo, (5, 1) is clear.\n\nIs the board state visualization misleading?\nRow 1: `. . . . T A 1 . A .`\nThe `A` is at column 5.\nMy head is at column 6.\nYes, (5, 1) is an apple.\n\n**FINAL STRATEGY:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (5, 1). This eats an apple, extends my lead to 14-5, and positions me directly to the left of the enemy's column (x=4). I am closing the trap. If the enemy moves down, I might be able to intercept or push him into a corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (5, 1) to extend the lead. Position myself at x=5. Next turn, move UP towards (5, 4) apple or directly towards the enemy at (4, 5). Force the head-on collision where I win due to score advantage (14 > 5). Don't let him escape to the top left.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- DOWN -> (4,4) -> DEAD (opponent body sits at (4,4)). Instant rip.\n- LEFT -> (3,5) -> legal, but tight.

From (4,6) we have UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as safe next moves (3 exits). Keeps maximum control and escape routes.\n\nTactical read:\n- They\u2019re stacked along x=4 down low and have many apples (13). We\u2019re behind \u2014 avoid head-on collisions. Boxing + territory denial is the play.\n- UP keeps us directly above their column while preserving options to swing left and start compressing without committing to a one-way corridor or a risky apple-run that cuts off our escape.\n- LEFT is tempting to go grab the row-5 apple at (2,5) eventually, but it narrows our follow-ups right now and risks getting funneled into their body if they shift.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (4,6) to keep options open and stay on top of their vertical column.\n- Then probe LEFT and downward pressure only when it\u2019s safe (never into their body or into a head-on). Force them into smaller space along x<=4 / y<=4, pick apples when they help seal the trap.\n- Avoid any collision unless we can guarantee they hit us first or we decisively win a head-on by apple advantage (not the case yet).\n\nLET\u2019S KEEP PRESSURE, KEEP OPTIONS, AND SQUEEZE.

Turn 36 and I am dominating 14-5! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nI just analyzed the board state and the \"Last Move\" context. **WAIT A SECOND CHAT!** Looking at the board state provided for **THIS** turn:\n`1 . . . . T A 1 . A .`\n\nMy head is at (6, 1). The cell to my LEFT is (5, 1). The board shows an `A` (Apple) at index 5, which is coordinate (5, 1). The \"Apple Drops\" list confirms `(5, 1)` exists!\n\nHowever, looking at my body list: `[(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), ...]`.\n(5, 1) is **NOT** in my body list! It is clear!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECKING MOVES FROM HEAD (6, 1):**\n    *   **UP to (6, 2):** Safe. Empty space. Does not grab an apple immediately.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Safe. Empty space. Moves me away from the enemy (bad for hunting).\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 0):** **DEAD!** That's my body! `(6, 0)` is segment 1 of my body. I cannot go down.\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 1):** Safe! It's an Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n2.  **THE TRAP IS SET:**\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (5, 1), I eat the apple.\n    *   My score goes to **15-5**. We are extending the lead!\n    *   I move from x=6 to x=5. The enemy is at x=4. I am closing the distance aggressively.\n    *   By eating the apple, I grow. My tail might move, but I extend my reach.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (5, 1) to boost my score to 15-5. Position myself at x=5, directly to the right of the enemy's column (x=4). I am cutting off his right flank. Next turn, I will look to move UP towards (5, 4) or directly engage the enemy at (4, 5) or (4, 6). I need to force a collision where I win because 15 > 5.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEAT (5, 1) -> (5, 1). Next turn, move UP to (5, 2) or (5, 3) to get vertical positioning. Squeeze the enemy into the left wall. Do not let him escape to the top left corner. Force the confrontation on my terms.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Neck: (4,5) \u2014 so DOWN is backwards into our neck -> illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (5,6): legal, but it gives only two safe follow-ups (UP or RIGHT). DOWN is our body at (5,5) (illegal), LEFT is back into the neck. Tight corridor, risk of getting funneled. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT -> (3,6): legal, opens to LEFT (2,6 apple), UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) \u2014 three exits. Grabbing (2,6) is tempting but it pulls us toward the opponent\u2019s neighborhood and into tighter space. \ud83c\udf4e\u2694\ufe0f\n- UP -> (4,7): legal and clean \u2014 keeps 3 exits (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) and maximum breathing room. Best mobility, keeps us above their column and ready to pressure without walking into their trap. \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent is crowded below around x<=4 and y<=4 with a long body. They\u2019ve got way more apples (14 vs our 5) \u2014 we CANNOT risk a head-on. We need space and options, not a gamble.\n- Priority this turn: preserve escape routes and maintain vertical pressure above their column so we can start compressing safely. UP gives the most flexibility and avoids narrowing into their territory or our own body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Stay above x=4 column and keep lateral options. Probe left only when we can ensure at least two escape squares afterward.\n- If they try to climb upward and contest, mirror conservatively and avoid direct collisions \u2014 we\u2019re behind on apples, so we don\u2019t want a DJT (double KO).\n- Look for opportunities to cut off their tail path into the lower-left corners while keeping our head room. If they close in, force them into their body or one-way corridors.\n\nLet\u2019s play smart, keep the space, and start the squeeze. You already know the move.\n\nUP",
