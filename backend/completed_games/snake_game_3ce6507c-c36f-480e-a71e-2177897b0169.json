We gotta be AGGRESSIVE and make him crash out! \ud83d\udc80\n\nCurrent State:\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (6, 9), no body, 0 apples. Clean slate!\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (9, 3), no body, 0 apples. Zero-threat mode.\n- Apples are scattered, but FOCUS is on the enemy. We need to dominate the board and box him in.\n\nStrategy:\nWe have a clean board with no immediate body threats. Our goal is to get closer to apples while keeping options open and setting up to trap the enemy. Since the enemy is at (9,3), far right bottom, we should move towards the center or left to control more space and potentially cut off his routes. Let's avoid moving directly towards his head to prevent early collisions.\n\nAvailable moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) -> Off board (y=10 invalid, max 9). Dead. \u274c\n- DOWN: (6,8) -> On board, no body, no enemy body. Safe. \ud83d\udfe2\n- LEFT: (5,9) -> On board, no body, no enemy body. Safe. \ud83d\udfe2\n- RIGHT: (7,9) -> On board, no body, no enemy body. Safe. \ud83d\udfe2\n\nEliminated: UP (off board). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, among SAFE moves:\n- DOWN to (6,8): Moves us closer to the bottom center. Nearby apples: (7,8) and (4,8? Wait, board shows A at (7,8). From (6,8), we could potentially go to (7,8) next turn if not blocked. Also, keeps us away from enemy (9,3). Future options: from (6,8), we can go DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), RIGHT to (7,8). Plenty of space. Avoids trapping.\n- LEFT to (5,9): Moves towards left edge. Apples nearby: (4,9? Actually, board shows apples at (0,9) but far. From (5,9), options: DOWN to (5,8), LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9). Also good space. But might move us away from central control.\n- RIGHT to (7,9): Moves towards right edge, closer to enemy? Enemy at (9,3), so not immediate, but might reduce future maneuvering space on right side. Options: DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), RIGHT to (8,9). Still decent.\n\nFor aggressive play and box-in strategy: We want to claim central/upper space to limit enemy's upward movement. Enemy is at (9,3) bottom-right, so moving DOWN or LEFT gives us better control of the upper board. RIGHT might bring us too close to right wall, which could trap us later.\n\nDecision: DOWN to (6,8) is ideal. It moves us towards the center (closer to apples like (7,8) and (4,8)? Actually (4,8) not an apple, but (7,8) is. Also, from (6,8), we can later move towards (4,6) or other apples while staying mobile. LEFT is good but we're already left of center. RIGHT is less favorable as it pushes us towards enemy side.\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns: Chase apples at (7,8) or (4,6) to grow, while keeping an eye on enemy's moves. If he moves up, we cut him off by taking the upper rows. Force him into a corner!\n\nLet's move!\n\nDOWN",

We're locked in with Snake #0 who's got 1 apple on us\u2014time to catch up and then trap him! \ud83d\udc80\n\nCurrent state:\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (6,8), no body. We're clean and ready to roll.\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (9,2), body at (9,3), 1 apple. He's clustered near the right edge\u2014good, he's boxed in on the right side already!\n- Apples are everywhere, but we're ignoring apples for now. Focus is on enemy. We need to dominate the board and force him into a corner. Enemy is at (9,2) bottom-right corner, so we should claim the left/center to cut off his escape routes.\n\nFrom (6,8), let's evaluate moves:\n- UP: (6,9) -> On board, no body, no enemy body. Safe! Options: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (but UP would be back into (6,8) which is our own body? Wait, our body is none, so (6,9) is fine. Actually, from (6,9) next turn, we could go DOWN back to (6,8), but that's not \"backwards\" into own body because body is empty. So it's safe. However, (6,9) is top row\u2014limiting future upward moves, but we can still go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. Might be okay.\n- DOWN: (6,7) -> On board, no body, no enemy body. Safe! Options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (to (6,6)). More space downward.\n- LEFT: (5,8) -> On board, safe. Moves us left towards center-left. Good for controlling more space.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) -> On board, safe. But (7,8) has an apple! Wait, checking board: Row 8 (y=8): \". . . . . . 1 A . A\" \u2014 that's (6,8) is 1 (our head), (7,8) is A (apple), (8,8) is ., (9,8) is A. So RIGHT to (7,8) would eat an apple immediately! That's +1 score, +1 growth. That's content and gets us on the board with a lead. Also, it moves us closer to the right side but still safe. From (7,8), future options: LEFT (back to (6,8)), DOWN (7,7) which is A, UP (7,9), RIGHT (8,8). Plenty of space. And eating apple puts us at 1 apple, tying with enemy (he has 1). But we want to dominate, so growing is key.\n\nWe're aggressive and want to box in the enemy. Enemy at (9,2) is stuck near the right wall; if we move RIGHT to (7,8), we're still left of him (x=7 vs 9), and we grow. But is it safe? Let's consider enemy's possible moves. Enemy at (9,2) body at (9,3). He could move LEFT to (8,2) (down-left), or DOWN to (9,1) (apple there), or UP to (9,3) but that's his body? Wait, his body is (9,3), so moving UP to (9,3) would hit his own body\u2014dead. So he won't do that. He could move RIGHT but off board\u2014dead. So his safe moves: LEFT to (8,2), DOWN to (9,1). He might go for apple at (9,1) or (8,2). We're at (7,8), far away. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,8) and eat apple, we grow to length 1 (head at (7,8), body will be previous head (6,8) after next move). That's good.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP to (6,9): Safe, but no apple. Might be less aggressive for growth. (6,9) is near top, could trap us later if we go too high. But it's okay.\n- DOWN to (6,7): Safe, no apple. Moves us down, away from top, more central. Good space.\n- LEFT to (5,8): Safe, no apple. Moves left, away from enemy, good for control.\n\nBest aggressive move: RIGHT to (7,8) for apple. It grows us immediately, ties score, and keeps us mobile. Also, it positions us to potentially chase other apples like (7,7) or (8,6) next. We're still left of enemy, so we can cut him off from the left side. Let's go for it!\n\nPlan for next few turns: After eating (7,8), watch enemy's move. If he goes LEFT, we might chase him left. If he goes DOWN for apple, we can head towards center to block his upward paths. Keep growing to dominate space and force him into walls.\n\nLet's eat that apple and get hyped! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

We just ate that apple at (7,8) and now we're tied with Snake #0 at 1 apple each. \ud83d\udcaa Time to push our advantage and start boxing him in!  \n\nCurrent state:  \n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (7,8), body now [(6,8)] (since we grew). We're length 2.  \n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (8,2), body at (9,2). He\u2019s still lurking in the bottom-right corner.  \n- Apples are scattered, but we\u2019re ignoring them\u2014focus on the enemy! He\u2019s trapped on the right edge; we need to take over the center and left side to cut off his escape routes.  \n\nFrom (7,8), let\u2019s evaluate moves:  \n- **UP (7,9)**: On board (y=9 is top row). No body, no enemy body. Safe! But (7,9) is empty\u2014no apple. Moving UP puts us at the top, which limits upward options later. Might trap us if we go too high.  \n- **DOWN (7,7)**: On board. (7,7) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e That would grow us again, putting us at 2 apples and leading by 1. Safe move\u2014no body, no enemy. From there, we\u2019d have options: UP (back to 7,8), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7), DOWN (7,6). Plenty of space!  \n- **LEFT (6,8)**: On board. This is our own body! We\u2019d crash into ourselves\u2014DEAD. Eliminate immediately.  \n- **RIGHT (8,8)**: On board. (8,8) is empty. Safe\u2014no body, no enemy. But no apple. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to the enemy (he\u2019s at x=8, y=2), but we\u2019re still far apart. From (8,8), options: LEFT (back to 7,8), DOWN (8,7), RIGHT (9,8), UP (8,9). Also plenty of space.  \n\n**Eliminating unsafe moves:** LEFT is death\u2014into own body. Other three are safe.  \n\nNow, among safe moves:  \n- **UP to (7,9)**: Neutral\u2014no growth, but keeps us mobile. However, top row might limit us later if enemy pushes upward. Not ideal for aggression.  \n- **DOWN to (7,7)**: GROWS US! +1 apple, +1 length. We lead 2-1 in apples. This positions us more centrally (y=7) and closer to other apples like (6,2) or (8,6). Also, from (7,7), we can easily pivot left or right to chase the enemy or block his paths.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,8)**: No growth, but moves us rightward. Could help cut off enemy if he tries to go up, but we\u2019re not eating anything. Less aggressive.  \n\n**Best aggressive move:** DOWN to (7,7) for the apple! It grows us immediately, extends our lead, and keeps us in a flexible central position. We\u2019re still left of the enemy (x=7 vs 8,2), so we can dominate the board from here. Plus, eating apples is content\u2014chat loves it!  \n\nLong-term plan: After this move, watch enemy\u2019s response. If he moves LEFT to (7,2) or DOWN to (8,1), we\u2019ll chase him toward the left edge. Our goal is to trap him against the wall while we control the center.

Turn 4 of 150\u2014we\u2019re tied in apples, but we\u2019re on the attack! \ud83d\udd25  \n\n**Current State Recap:**  \n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (8,7), body [(7,7), (7,8)]. Length: 3. Apples: 2.  \n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (6,2), body [(7,2), (8,2)]. Length: 3. Apples: 2.  \n- **Board:** Enemy is stacked vertically at x=6-8, y=2. We\u2019re near the top-right, with an apple at (8,6) below us.  \n\n**My Moves (from Head at (8,7)):**  \n- **UP (8,8):** Safe? Let\u2019s check! (8,8) is empty (board shows 'T' at (8,8)? Wait\u2014board shows 'T' at (8,8) in row 8, but that\u2019s likely an apple typo? Actually, board row 8: `. . . . . . . T . A`\u2014T is at (7,8)? Hmm, but our body is at (7,8). The board might be misaligned. Let\u2019s trust coordinates: (8,8) should be empty based on the list. But to be safe, avoid UP if unsure\u2014board shows a T (maybe tail?) but we can\u2019t risk it. Eliminate UP if uncertain.  \n- **DOWN (8,6):** Safe! (8,6) has an apple (listed in apple drops). That\u2019s a growth opportunity! From there, we can go LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6), DOWN (8,5). Good options.  \n- **LEFT (7,7):** That\u2019s our own body segment (second segment). Moving into our own body\u2014DEAD! Eliminate.  \n- **RIGHT (9,7):** Safe? (9,7) is on the edge (x=9 is max). Empty? Board shows nothing there. From (9,7), we can only go LEFT (back), DOWN (9,6), or UP (9,8). Limited options\u2014trapped against right wall. Not ideal for aggression.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **UP is risky**\u2014board shows a 'T' at (8,8)? Might be an apple or tail. Since we can\u2019t confirm, we avoid suicide.  \n- **RIGHT to (9,7)** is safe but boxes us in\u2014no right move, only up/down/left. That limits future hunting.  \n- **DOWN to (8,6)** is perfect\u2014apple there, grows us to length 4, and from (8,6) we have LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN options. We stay aggressive, near enemy territory (enemy at y=2, we\u2019re at y=6). If enemy moves UP, we can chase. If he moves RIGHT to (7,2) or (8,2), we might force a head-on later.  \n\n**Aggressive Play:** Eating the apple at (8,6) boosts our score to 3\u2014now we LEAD! With higher score, we can pressure enemy into a head-on collision. From (8,6), we\u2019re closer to intercepting enemy if he goes UP. Also, we can cut off his escape routes.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Grow now to dominate. After (8,6), pivot LEFT or DOWN to steer enemy toward walls. If he moves UP, we chase. If he hesitates, we trap him on the right edge. Goal: force him into a bad move while we grow.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8,6). Safe, grows us, and keeps options open. Let\u2019s eat and hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5  \n\nDOWN",

Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (5,2), body [(6,2), (7,2)]. Length: 3. Apples: 2.\n- **Board:** Enemy is low on the left, we\u2019re mid-right. Apple at (4,5) is close to enemy but we can chase.\n\n**My Moves (from Head at (8,6)):**\n- **UP to (8,7):** That\u2019s my own body segment (first after head)\u2014DEAD! Can\u2019t move into yourself. Eliminate.\n- **DOWN to (8,5):** Safe? Check board: (8,5) is empty (row 5 shows `. A . . . A . . . .`\u2014so (8,5) is '.'). Good! From there, options: UP (back to (8,6)), LEFT (7,5), DOWN (8,4), RIGHT (9,5). Plenty of space.\n- **LEFT to (7,6):** Safe? (7,6) is empty (board row 6: `. . . . A . . . 1 .`\u2014so (7,6) is '.'). Good! From there, options: UP (7,7) but that\u2019s my own body (second segment)\u2014DEAD if I go there later, but for now moving into (7,6) is fine. LEFT (6,6), DOWN (7,5), RIGHT (back to (8,6)).\n- **RIGHT to (9,6):** Safe? (9,6) is on the edge (x=9 max). Empty? Board row 6: last column is '.' (since head at 8,6). Good. From there, options: LEFT (back to (8,6)), UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5). But RIGHT is blocked\u2014trapped against wall. Not ideal for aggression.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **UP is a death sentence**\u2014into my own neck. No go.\n- **RIGHT boxes me in** against the right wall\u2014limited escape routes. If enemy comes up, I\u2019m stuck. Avoid.\n- **DOWN to (8,5)** is solid\u2014safe, opens up DOWN and LEFT paths. I can head toward the apple at (4,5) or cut off enemy\u2019s potential UP moves.\n- **LEFT to (7,6)** is also strong\u2014safe, moves me toward enemy territory (enemy at y=2, I\u2019m at y=6). From (7,6), I can go LEFT to (6,6) and potentially block enemy\u2019s path if he goes RIGHT. Also, (7,6) is closer to apples like (4,5) or (5,3).\n\n**Aggressive Play:** Since I\u2019m leading 3-2, I want to corner the enemy. Enemy is at (5,2) with body down the y-axis. If I go LEFT, I can position myself to cut off his right-side escape. If he moves UP, I might chase or force a head-on if he\u2019s dumb. If I go DOWN, I can pivot left later to flank him.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Move LEFT to (7,6) to close distance and control mid-board. Next turn, aim to go LEFT again to (6,6) or DOWN to (7,5) to keep options open. Watch enemy\u2019s move\u2014if he goes UP, I can head toward him to threaten collision. Goal: trap him against the left wall or force a mistake while I eat apples safely.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (7,6). Safe, aggressive, and keeps me hunting!

Let\u2019s crush him! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**State Recap:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (7,6), body [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7)]. Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (4,2), body [(5,2), (6,2), (7,2)]. Length: 4. Apples: 3. (He grew! Now we're neck-and-neck.)\n- **Board:** Apples everywhere, but focus on enemy. He's low-left at (4,2). I'm at (7,6). We both have 3 apples\u2014score is TIED. Time to be aggressive! If we force a head-on collision and I survive, I win by being ahead? Actually, rules: if heads collide, both die. But if he crashes into me, he dies. I want to maneuver so he either crashes into my body or I trap him. Since scores are equal, I need to grow or force an error.\n\n**Check moves from (7,6):**\n- **UP to (7,7):** That's my own body (second segment). DEAD. Can't go there.\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** Safe? Board row 5: (7,5) is '.' (row 5: `. A . A A . . . . .`\u2014so (7,5) is '.'). Good. From there, options: UP (back to 7,6), LEFT (6,5), DOWN (7,4), RIGHT (8,5). Plenty of space. Moves me toward the apple at (4,5) or (5,3) maybe, but more importantly, I can flank enemy if he goes UP.\n- **LEFT to (6,6):** Safe? (6,6) is '.' (row 6: `. . . . A . . . . .`\u2014yes). Good. From there, options: UP (6,7) is apple at (6,7)? Wait, apple list includes (6,7). But moving onto apple means I GROW and get point. That's huge! Also, from (6,6), I can go LEFT (5,6), DOWN (6,5), RIGHT (back to 7,6). And UP to apple (6,7) is tempting for next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (8,6):** That's my own body (first after head). DEAD. (Actually, (8,6) is part of my body\u2014first element after head in list [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7)]. So moving into my own body = death.) So RIGHT is invalid.\n\n**Elimination:**\n- UP and RIGHT are immediate deaths. No go.\n- DOWN and LEFT are both safe.\n\n**Aggressive Analysis:**\n- **DOWN to (7,5):** Safe, but I'm moving down toward y=5. Enemy is at y=2, might go UP to chase apples. From (7,5), I can later go LEFT to (6,5) or UP to (7,6). Not directly toward enemy, but I can cut off his right side if he goes UP. However, I'm not growing immediately.\n- **LEFT to (6,6):** SAFE and I land on an apple at (6,7)? Wait, (6,6) is not an apple\u2014apple at (6,7) is ABOVE (6,6). So moving LEFT to (6,6) doesn't eat an apple now, but (6,7) is an apple (apple list: (6,7)). From (6,6), I can go UP next turn to eat (6,7) and grow! That puts me at 4 apples vs enemy's 3. HUGE! Also, moving LEFT brings me closer to enemy's territory (x=4 vs my x=6). I can then go LEFT again to (5,6) or DOWN to (6,5) to approach enemy.\n\n**Forcing a win:**\nSince scores are tied, I need to either grow first or force enemy into a mistake. Going LEFT to (6,6) sets up growth next turn (UP to apple at 6,7). Meanwhile, enemy might move toward his own apples (like (4,5) or (3,5)). If he goes UP, I can chase and potentially corner him against the left wall or my body.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (6,6) to position for apple growth next turn. Then, after eating, I'll have length 5 and 4 apples. Then, push LEFT to (5,6) and DOWN to (5,5) to block enemy's upward path. Force him into a tight spot\u2014maybe against the left wall or into my body. If he tries to head-on me, I'll have the size advantage. Stay aggressive! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (6,6) for positioning and future apple!\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 4.  \n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (3,1), body [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]. Apples: 4. (He\u2019s still near the bottom-left, likely moving UP or RIGHT.)  \n- **Board:** Apple at (5,7) is tempting, but I\u2019m focusing on the enemy\u2019s position\u2014he\u2019s vulnerable! I\u2019m at y=7, he\u2019s at y=1. I can dive down and trap him against the left wall.  \n\n**Check moves from (6,7):**  \n- **UP to (6,8):** Safe? (6,8) is '.' (row 8: `. . . . . . . . . A`\u2014yes). From there, I can go LEFT (5,8), DOWN (back to 6,7), RIGHT (7,8). No apple, but I\u2019m positioning high to cut off his escape if he moves UP.  \n- **DOWN to (6,6):** That\u2019s my own body (first segment after head). DEAD.  \n- **LEFT to (5,7):** That\u2019s an apple! I GROW and get +1 point! Length becomes 5, head at (5,7). From there, I can go UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (back to 6,7). Safe and aggressive\u2014closer to enemy\u2019s x=3!  \n- **RIGHT to (7,7):** Safe? (7,7) is '.' (row 7: `. . . A A . . 1 . T .`\u2014yes, it\u2019s open). From there, I can go UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6) (my body? Wait, (7,6) is in my body list\u2014yes! So DOWN is into my own body\u2014DEAD). LEFT (back to 6,7), RIGHT (8,7) (my tail, but moving into tail? Tail is (8,7), but if I move into it, it\u2019s my body\u2014DEAD). So RIGHT from (6,7) to (7,7) is safe, but from (7,7), only UP and LEFT are safe? That\u2019s getting boxed in.  \n\n**Elimination:**  \n- DOWN is immediate death (into my own body).  \n- RIGHT leads to a dead-end later (only one safe exit from (7,7)).  \n- UP is safe but no growth, and I\u2019m moving away from the enemy.  \n- LEFT to (5,7) is SAFE, gives me an apple, and moves me LEFT toward the enemy!  \n\n**Aggressive Analysis:**  \n- **LEFT to (5,7):** I EAT THE APPLE! Now I\u2019m at 5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 4\u2014LEAD! From (5,7), I can go LEFT to (4,7) next turn, getting even closer to his x=3. If he moves UP to (3,2) or (4,2) \u2192 (3,3) or (4,3), I can chase and trap him against the left wall. He\u2019s at y=1, I\u2019m at y=7\u2014I have the height advantage. If he tries to come up, I can intercept. Head-on collision? If he moves RIGHT into my path, I\u2019m bigger (5 vs 4)\u2014I survive, he dies!  \n- Other moves: UP delays growth and lets him potentially eat and tie again. RIGHT traps me. LEFT is the power move\u2014grow, lead, and pressure!  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat the apple at (5,7) now\u2014take the 5-4 lead. Then from (5,7), push LEFT to (4,7) to cut off his escape. If he goes UP, I chase and box him in against the top-left corner. Keep growing while dominating the board. If he challenges me, I\u2019m bigger\u2014crush him!  \n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (5,7) for the apple and the lead! LET\u2019S GOOO!  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy Snake #0 has 5 apples, head at (1,1), body snaking right to (5,2). We're behind by one apple, so we need to grow and dominate. The board is packed with apples, but I'm ignoring them\u2014focus on boxing in the enemy! He's low-left (y=1), I'm mid-high (y=7). Time to descend and cut off his escape routes. Let's go aggressive and force a collision where I win because I'm bigger? Actually, I'm smaller (4 vs 5), so avoid direct head-on unless I'm sure I win\u2014wait, rules say if I crash into him, I lose. If he crashes into me, he loses. So I need to position to make him crash into my body or force him into a trap. Plan: Move DOWN to get closer to his level and control the left side.\n\nCheck moves from head (4,7):\n- UP to (4,8): Safe? (4,8) is '.' (row 8: `. . . . . . . . . A`\u2014yep, open). From there, options: UP to (4,9) (safe, row 9: `A . . . . . . . . .`\u2014(4,9) is '.'), LEFT to (3,8) ('.'?), RIGHT (5,8) ('.'?), DOWN back to (4,7). But I'm moving away from enemy\u2014no! I want to descend, not ascend. Chat, we chase, not flee!\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe? (4,6) is 'A' (apple! Row 6: `. . . . A . T T T .`\u2014(4,6) is apple). My body is [(5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6)]\u2014(4,6) is clear, not off-board, not into myself. From there, I grow to 5 apples (tying his score!) and options: DOWN to (4,5) ('A' on row 5: `. A . A A . . . . .`\u2014(4,5) is apple but safe? Yes), LEFT to (3,6) ('.'), RIGHT to (5,6) ('.'), UP back to (4,7). All open\u2014perfect for trapping! And I'm moving toward y=5, getting closer to his y=1 area without overextending.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe? (3,7) is 'A' (apple! Row 7: `. . . A A 1 T T . . .`\u2014yes, (3,7) is apple). My body? No overlap. From there, options: LEFT to (2,7) ('.'?), DOWN to (3,6) ('.'), RIGHT back to (4,7), UP to (3,8) ('.'). Also good, eats an apple, but I stay at y=7\u2014still high. Good for cutting left, but I want to descend faster to corner him.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Safe? (5,7) is '.' (row 7\u2014yes). But from there, RIGHT to (6,7) is my own body! DEAD. So RIGHT is risky long-term, limits future moves.\n\nEliminate: RIGHT is bad (potential self-crash next turn). UP moves away from enemy\u2014bad for aggression. LEFT is safe but keeps me high. DOWN is SAFE, EATS AN APPLE (grow to 5, tie score!), moves me closer to the enemy (y=6), and opens up multiple exits including DOWN (toward y=5) and LEFT (toward x=3). Aggressive play: Descend to mid-board, position to intercept his potential UP moves. If he goes UP from (1,1) to (1,2) or (2,1), I'll be at (4,6) and can chase left/down. Plus, with 5 apples, I match his score\u2014if he forces head-on into my body, he dies. Let's grow and own the board!\n\nLong-term plan: Eat apple at (4,6), move to (4,6). Next, from there, go DOWN to (4,5) (another apple!) to hit 6 apples and control y=5. Then LEFT toward x=3 to box him against left wall. If he tries to snake up, I'll cut him off. Keep options open\u2014never trap myself. We win by dominating space, not just apples!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze the board and plot our move! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Board scan from my head at (4,5):**\n- UP to (4,6): That's my old spot (now empty since I moved). Safe? My body is now at [(4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6)] after growing. So (4,6) is occupied by my body! **DEAD.** Eliminated.\n- DOWN to (4,4): Empty ('.'). Safe! Body doesn't block this. From there, options: DOWN to (4,3) (apple at (4,3)? Wait, apples are listed as (4,3) in drops\u2014yes! That's a future apple). LEFT to (3,4) ('.'), RIGHT to (5,4) ('.'), UP back to (4,5).

On the board display, it's marked as 'A' in row 5: \". A A A 1 . . . . .\" Wait, let's double-check: Row 5 is \". A A A 1 . . . . .\" So (3,5) is 'A'! Indeed, from drops (3,5) is an apple. So moving LEFT eats an apple! That's content and grows to 7 apples\u2014LEAD OVER ENEMY! Safe? My body doesn't hit it. From (3,5), options: DOWN to (3,4) ('.'), LEFT to (2,5) (apple at (2,5)? Drops say yes, but board shows 'A' at (2,5) in row 5? Row 5: col 2 is 'A'\u2014yes. So another apple!), RIGHT to (4,5) (old spot, empty), UP to (3,6) ('.'? Row 6 col 3 is '.' but my body is at (4,6) not there). Multiple escapes. Perfect for climbing in x and boxing enemy against left wall.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Empty ('.'). Safe. From there, options: RIGHT to (6,5) ('.'), DOWN to (5,4) ('.'), UP to (5,6) ('.'? But (5,6) is '.' in row 6, and my body is at (6,6) and (7,6)\u2014not blocking). LEFT back to (4,5). Also good, but moves me away from left-side apples where enemy might be heading.\n\n**Elimination:**\n- UP is death\u2014can't go into my own body.\n- All others are safe immediately.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- LEFT is the strongest: Eats an apple (7-6 lead!), keeps multiple safe paths, and positions me at x=3, y=5\u2014closer to enemy's path (he's at x=1, y=3, likely going right/up). This cuts off his escape to the right and forces him toward the left wall where he'll be trapped.\n- DOWN is solid: Gets to (4,4) for potential apple at (4,3) next, but no immediate grow. Still aggressive for mid-board control.\n- RIGHT is okay but shifts me right (x=5), potentially letting enemy slip left if he goes for bottom apples.\n\n**Aggressive strategy:** We're tied! Need to push the lead and pressure. LEFT to eat that apple at (3,5) gives me 7 apples\u2014LEAD! Then from (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4) to chase enemy (he might go to (2,4) or (1,4)), or LEFT to (2,5) for another apple. This boxes him in against bottom-left corner (x=0-2, y=0-3). If he goes for (0,9) or top-right, I mirror and own the center-left. Force him into a wall and crash him! Don't let him breathe. We're LIVE and hungry\u2014time to dominate! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLong-term plan: Eat left-side apples to grow and control x=2-4. Chase enemy toward x=0, y=0. If he heads right, cut him off and force head-on if I'm ahead (7>6). Keep eyes on his moves\u2014anticipate and trap!\n\nLEFT",

My body: Tail at (7,6) is far, and I grew last turn (added head at (3,5), old head (4,5) becomes body, so new body: [(4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6)]). (3,6) is not in my body.

RIGHT to (4,6) is my old spot but now empty? Wait, (4,6) is my body now? After moving, body shifts: my tail (7,6) moves to (6,6)? No, body is fixed except new head adds. Actually, body segments are static unless eating or dying. My body currently: (4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(6,7),(6,6),(7,6). So (4,6) is occupied\u2014can't go RIGHT back there without dying if it were my head, but from (3,6) moving RIGHT would hit my own body at (4,6). So UP option: From (3,6), immediate follow-ups: LEFT (3,5) is old head\u2014empty now, DOWN back to (3,5), RIGHT (4,6) is body\u2014DEAD if move there, UP to (3,7) safe. So at least 3 safe starts (LEFT, DOWN, UP). Excellent mobility.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,4):** Row 4 col 3 is '.'\u2014empty. Safe. My body doesn't block. Enemy body? (3,1),(3,2)\u2014no. From here, DOWN to (3,3) is '.'? Row 3 col 3 is '.'\u2014yes. LEFT to (2,4) '.'? Row 4 col 2 is '.'\u2014yes. RIGHT to (4,4) '.'\u2014yes. UP back to (3,5). All 4 directions safe! Perfect control of mid-board.\n\n- **LEFT to (2,5):** Row 5 col 2 is 'A'\u2014apple! Eats it, grows to 8 apples! Lead increases to 8-6. Safe? My body? (2,5) not in current body. Enemy body? (2,1) but y=1, not 5. Good. From there, options: RIGHT back to (3,5) safe, DOWN to (2,4) '.'\u2014safe, LEFT to (1,5) has apple at (1,5)? Drops say yes, board shows 'A' in row 5 col 1? Row 5: \".

All 4 directions open, and chaining apples to box enemy.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** Old head spot\u2014now empty (since I moved to (3,5)). Safe. But no apple. My body? (4,5) is now the second segment of my body? Wait, after last move, my body includes (4,5) as the first body segment (old head). So moving back to (4,5) would be hitting my own body\u2014DEAD! Can't go backwards into self. Eliminated. Also, from (4,5), options limited: LEFT to (3,5) safe, DOWN to (4,4) safe, RIGHT to (5,5) safe, UP to (4,6) is body\u2014dead. So even if safe, it's not as good.\n\n**Elimination:**\n- RIGHT is death\u2014backwards into my own body. Dead.\n- UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe immediately.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **LEFT is the move:** Eats apple, grows to 8-6 lead, and positions me at (2,5). This is aggressive\u2014enemy at (1,4) is close, likely moving UP to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,4). If he goes UP, I could chase or force collision. From (2,5), I control left side, cut off his escape to bottom-right apples like (0,9) or (4,0). If he crashes into my body later? He dies. I own the left corridor. Plan: Next turn, if safe, LEFT to (1,5) for another apple (9-6!), then chase his head toward bottom-left where he'll be trapped against wall/apples. Force head-on if he's dumb.\n- **UP to (3,6):** Safe, sets up for apple at (3,7), but slower grow. Enemy might slip left/down. Less pressure.\n- **DOWN to (3,4):** Very safe, opens bottom options (apples at (4,3),(2,0), etc.), but no immediate grow. Good for defense if he rushes, but we're ahead\u2014attack!\n\n**Aggressive strategy:** We're up 7-6! Eat that left apple to extend the lead and force him into a corner. Mirror his moves to trap him\u2014push toward x=0, y=0. If he goes for top-right, I'll cut through center. Keep body safe; use apples to grow and dominate space. Long-term: Chain left-side apples ((2,5)->(1,5)->(0,9) path?), but prioritize chasing his head. Anticipate his UP to (1,5)\u2014if so, I could go DOWN from (2,5) to (2,4) to block, or LEFT to collide if I'm bigger.

But first, safety check!  \n\n**Board scan from (2,6):**  \n- **UP to (2,7):** Row 7 col 2 is 'A'\u2014apple! Eats for 9-7 lead. Is it safe? My body: closest is (2,5) below\u2014no self-crash. Enemy: heads at (1,6), body segments at (1,5),(1,4)... so (2,7) is clear. From (2,7) next turn, we have LEFT to (1,7) 'A'? Row 7 col 1 is 'A'\u2014apple! RIGHT to (3,7) 'T'\u2014my own tail? Wait, (3,7) is in my body list? My body includes (4,7),(5,7),(6,7),(6,6)... (3,7) isn't listed, but (3,5) is. Actually, (3,7) is '.'\u2014empty? Wait, board shows row 7: \". . A A T T T . . .\" so col 3 is 'A'? Let's read: positions: col 0 '.', col 1 '.', col 2 'A', col 3 'A', col 4 'T', col 5 'T', col 6 'T', etc. So (3,7) is col 3 y=7 \u2192 'A'\u2014apple! Not tail. So (2,7) UP gives options: LEFT to (1,7) 'A' (eat apple!), RIGHT to (3,7) 'A' (another apple!), DOWN back to (2,6) safe. All 4 directions safe! This is GROWTH PATH\u2014perfect for dominating and trapping enemy below.  \n- **DOWN to (2,5):** Row 5 col 2 is 'T'\u2014my own body segment! (First body tuple is (2,5)). Moving into own body\u2014DEAD. Eliminate!  \n- **LEFT to (1,6):** Row 6 col 1 is '.'\u2014empty. Safe? Enemy head currently at (1,6)! If he stays or moves, we move into his head\u2014head-on collision, both die! Too risky. We're ahead, can't gamble. Eliminate.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,6):** Row 6 col 3 is '.'\u2014empty. Safe. From (3,6): options UP to (3,7) 'A' (apple), LEFT to (2,6) back, RIGHT to (4,6) 'T'? My body has (4,6) as segment\u2014yes! So moving into own body if go RIGHT. DOWN to (3,5) '.'? Empty. But only 3 safe moves, no immediate apple. Passive\u2014lets enemy grab apples and box us.  \n\n**Decision:** Only UP is SAFE and AGGRESSIVE! Forces growth, opens apple chain (2,7) \u2192 (1,7) or (3,7) next. Enemy is low on space (left wall), we push up to control top rows. If he goes UP to (1,7) to chase apple, we might head-on? But we can adapt\u2014grab apple first, then cut off his escape. Score 9-7, pressure on!  \n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating (2,7), pivot LEFT to (1,7) to eat that apple too, then DOWN-left to chase his tail at (1,1). Box him into left wall and force crash.

Our head is at (2,7) after eating that apple last turn (since we moved UP to (2,7) from (2,6)). Now, we gotta stay AGGRESSIVE and trap that enemy snake #0 who's hugging the left wall at (1,7) with a body going down to (2,1). They're at risk of crashing into us or the wall if we box them in!\n\n**Board scan from (2,7):**  \n- **UP to (2,8):** Row 8 col 2 is '.'\u2014empty! Safe. From (2,8), we can see apples at (3,7) 'A', (4,3) 'A', etc. But check enemy: they might go RIGHT to (2,7) or UP to (1,8). If they go RIGHT to (2,7) and we go UP, no collision. From (2,8), options: LEFT (1,8) '.' empty, RIGHT (3,8) '.' empty, DOWN (2,7) which is now empty (we left it), UP (2,9) 'A'\u2014apple at top! Opens path to top apples and controls center. Multiple safe follow-ups.  \n- **DOWN to (2,6):** Row 6 col 2 is '.'\u2014empty. Safe. But from (2,6), we're back where we were, and options: UP (2,7) 'A' (still apple? Wait, we ate it last turn?

Enemy at (1,7) now? Wait, enemy head is at (1,7) this turn? Actually, board shows enemy head (1,7) '0' in row 7. So (1,6) is empty. But if we go DOWN to (2,6), we might trap but less growth. From (2,6): DOWN (2,5) 'T'\u2014my body! DEAD move. So limited options.  \n- **LEFT to (1,7):** Row 7 col 1 is 'A'\u2014apple! But enemy head is currently at (1,7)? Wait, board shows row 7: \". 0 1 A T...\" so col 1 is '0' (enemy head). If we move LEFT to (1,7), we're moving into enemy head's CURRENT position. Since moves are simultaneous, if enemy stays or moves away, we might eat the apple and survive, but if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,7), we collide heads\u2014both die! Risky. We're ahead 9-7, can't gamble on double KO. Eliminate.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,7):** Row 7 col 3 is 'A'\u2014apple! Safe? Enemy at (1,7), body at (1,6) etc. (3,7) empty. From (3,7): UP (3,8) '.' empty, LEFT (2,7) empty (we left it), RIGHT (4,7) 'T'\u2014my body segment! DEAD if go RIGHT. DOWN (3,6) '.' empty. So 3 safe moves, including eating another apple. But does this trap us? We're moving right, away from enemy. Enemy could chase us or grab apples on left.  \n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (3,7) is the safest and most aggressive! We eat another apple (now 10-7 lead!), stay alive, and open options to pivot LEFT later or UP to (3,8) to control middle. From (3,7), we can threaten enemy's left side while keeping escape routes. UP to (2,8) was close but RIGHT gives immediate growth and avoids any head-on risk this turn. Long-term: After eating (3,7), move UP to (3,8) next to chase apples at (4,3) or (3,0), then circle back to box enemy into the bottom-left corner. We're the alpha snake\u2014no mercy! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Long-term plan:** Dominate the center after eating (3,7). Cut off enemy's escape routes by moving toward (3,8)/(4,8) to control top rows, then sweep down to block their path to apples on the right. Force them into a corner\u2014crash or starve!\n\nRIGHT",

Time to press the advantage and force that enemy snake into a corner! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nCurrent head at (3,7). Let's break down the moves:\n\n**UP to (3,8):** Row 8 col 3 is '.' - empty! From there: UP (3,9) 'A' - apple! LEFT (2,8) '.' - empty, RIGHT (4,8) '.' - empty, DOWN (3,7) empty (we left). That's THREE safe follow-ups including an apple! This controls the top row and sets up the attack path. Enemy at (1,8) can't reach us up here easily.\n\n**DOWN to (3,6):** Row 6 col 3 is '.' - empty. From there: UP (3,7) empty, LEFT (2,6) 'T' - MY BODY! DEAD! RIGHT (4,6) 'T' - also my body! DOWN (3,5) 'T' - another body segment! This is a TRAP - only one safe direction (UP). Eliminate!\n\n**LEFT to (2,7):** Row 7 col 2 is 'A' - apple! But wait... that's empty now? Actually we moved FROM (2,7) last turn to (3,7). But enemy body might be there? Enemy is at (1,8) heading down left side. (2,7) should be empty now. However, from (2,7) our options: UP (2,8) empty, LEFT (1,7) where enemy head WAS, RIGHT (3,7) empty, DOWN (2,6) empty. All safe? Actually DOWN (2,6) is my body segment! That's backwards into myself! So LEFT is safe now but gives only 2 safe moves (UP and RIGHT). Less flexible.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,7):** Row 7 col 4 is 'T' - MY BODY! DEAD MOVE! I'm currently at (3,7), body goes to (4,7) from previous positions. Can't go right.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP is the KING move! We get to (3,8), then can go UP to (3,9) for apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to control the top. This positions us perfectly to SWEEP DOWN and box enemy into the left wall. Enemy is stuck on the left side with their body forming a line - we can cut them off from the apples on the right!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating (3,9) apple next turn, move LEFT to (2,9) or (2,8) to cut off enemy's upward escape. Then chase down to block their path to the bottom-left apples while maintaining center control. We're turning this into a CHICKEN FIGHT!

Time to press the advantage and force that enemy snake into a corner! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nCurrent head at (3,8). Let's break down the moves:\n\n**UP to (3,9):** Row 9 col 3 is 'A' - apple! That's a GROW move! From there: LEFT (2,9) '.' - empty, RIGHT (4,9) '.' - empty, DOWN (3,8) empty (we left). But wait, is (3,9) safe? Let's check if the enemy snake could be moving there. Enemy is at (1,9) with body down to (1,2). The only way they could reach (3,9) is by moving RIGHT to (2,9) this turn, then UP to (2,10) which is off-board (DEAD), or RIGHT to (3,9) next turn. However, if we go UP to (3,9) this turn, we occupy it. Enemy moving RIGHT to (2,9) would be safe for them but doesn't threaten us. So UP seems safe for this turn, but we need to consider what happens next. From (3,9), we'd be at the top edge with only DOWN as a safe retreat, potentially trapping us.\n\n**DOWN to (3,7):** Row 7 col 3 is '.' - empty. From there: UP (3,8) empty, LEFT (2,7) '.' - empty (we moved from there), RIGHT (4,7) 'T' - MY BODY! DEAD if we go right. DOWN (3,6) 'T' - also MY BODY! So from (3,7), we'd have only 2 safe directions (UP and LEFT), with LEFT leading toward the enemy's side. This gives us flexibility to move LEFT toward the enemy or UP back to safety. This seems better than being trapped at the top.\n\n**LEFT to (2,8):** Row 8 col 2 is '.' - empty. From there: UP (2,9) '.' - empty, LEFT (1,8) where the enemy head CURRENTLY IS! But we move simultaneously, so if enemy moves DOWN to (1,8), they'd be there at the same time as we move to (2,8)? No, we're moving to (2,8), they're moving from (1,9) to somewhere. If they move DOWN to (1,8), we're at (2,8) - no collision. But if they move RIGHT to (2,9), we could potentially collide if we also go UP next turn? More importantly, LEFT (2,8) gives us: UP (2,9) empty, LEFT (1,8) empty (enemy left), RIGHT (3,8) empty (we left), DOWN (2,7) empty. All safe! That's 4 safe directions from (2,8)! This gives us maximum flexibility to chase the enemy or retreat.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,8):** Row 8 col 4 is '.' - empty. From there: UP (4,9) '.' - empty, LEFT (3,8) empty (we left), RIGHT (5,8) '.' - empty, DOWN (4,7) 'T' - MY BODY! So 3 safe directions. Good flexibility.\n\n**VERDICT:** LEFT to (2,8) is the KING move! It gives us maximum future options (4 safe moves) and positions us closer to the enemy on the left side. From (2,8), we can choose to go UP to (2,9) (blocking the top row), LEFT to (1,8) (directly at the enemy's previous position), or DOWN to chase their tail. This puts PRESSURE on the enemy who is currently at (1,9). We're cutting off their escape routes and forcing them into the corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After moving to (2,8), analyze enemy's likely move. If they move DOWN to (1,8), we could go LEFT to (1,8) on the next turn (if they move down, we'd move into their old spot, not a collision). If they move RIGHT to (2,9), we could go UP to (2,9) for a potential head-on collision (we have more apples, so we'd win if they don't crash into us first). We're setting up a CHICKEN FIGHT! Force them to make the wrong move and watch them crash! \ud83d\udc80\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

But gives up the apple at (2,9) and doesn't pressure the enemy.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,8):** Row 8 col 3 is 'T' - MY BODY! DEAD. Backwards into myself. Eliminated.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP to (2,9) is the ONLY aggressive, winning move! I get an apple (growing to 11), I move to the top edge where the enemy can't follow easily, and I force them to react. From (2,9), I'll have LEFT (1,9) and DOWN (2,8) as safe options. This puts me in their face and maintains pressure.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** After eating that apple at (2,9), I'll be at 11 apples. The enemy is at 7. I need to keep pushing down the left side to trap their tail. If they move DOWN to (2,8), I could chase them. If they move RIGHT to (3,9), I can go DOWN to (2,8) to cut off their retreat. I'm the alpha snake now! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LET'S GET THIS BAG!** UP",
