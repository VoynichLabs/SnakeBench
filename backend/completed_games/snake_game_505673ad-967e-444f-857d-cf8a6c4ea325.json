The only potential risk would be a head-on with the enemy, but they are far away and cannot reach (6,4) this turn.\n- Among safe options, RIGHT gives an immediate +1 apple and creates a two-segment body (head at (6,4), tail at (5,4)), which is still easy to manage since there are no nearby obstacles.\n- Plan: After gaining this apple, stay aware of space to avoid self-trapping and keep options open toward other apples like (5,6), (3,4), and (2,4 vicinity), while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT",

          "rationale": "Here is my reasoning and plan:\n\n**Board Analysis and Safety:**\nMy head is at (4, 1). My body is empty. The enemy snake #1 is at (5, 4).\nApple locations: (2,0), (9,2), (0,5), (1,3), (6,4), (2,2), (8,3), (3,4), (9,4), (1,6), (1,9), (9,0), (5,6), (2,8), (5,2).\n\nI need to avoid moving into the enemy snake's body or off the board.\n- **UP** to (4, 2): Occupied by an apple `A`. This is a valid move, I will grow.\n- **DOWN** to (4, 0): Empty `.`. Valid.\n- **LEFT** to (3, 1): Empty `.`. Valid.\n- **RIGHT** to (5, 1): Empty `.`. Valid.\n\n**Strategy and Enemy Prediction:**\nThe enemy snake is at (5, 4).\nThere is an apple at (6, 4), which is immediately to the right of the enemy.\nThere is an apple at (5, 2), which is two steps down from the enemy.\nThere is an apple at (5, 6), which is two steps up from the enemy.\nThere is an apple at (4, 2), which is diagonal up-left from the enemy and directly above my current position.\n\nIf I am the enemy, I see the immediate apple at (6, 4) is a strong candidate. However, moving right to (6, 4) puts the enemy's head directly adjacent to my head if I stay at (4, 1) (distance is roughly 2.8 units). If the enemy moves to (6, 4) and I move to (4, 2), we are separated by distance.\nIf the enemy moves to (5, 2) (Down), they collect an apple.\nIf the enemy moves to (5, 5) (Up), they get closer to (5, 6).\n\nHowever, considering the \"War\" aspect: The apple at (4, 2) is very close to me (1 move away) and looks like an accessible food source. If I take it, I grow.\nIf I go to (4, 2), I am at y=2.\nIf the enemy goes to (5, 2), they are at y=2 as well, adjacent to me. This creates a potential head-on collision or blockage next turn.\nIf the enemy goes to (6, 4), they are safe.\nIf the enemy goes to (5, 5), they are safe.\n\nCrucially, looking at the apple distribution, there is a cluster around (2,0)-(2,2). My current position (4,1) is close to this cluster.\nThere is an apple at (2,2).\nThere is an apple at (2,0).\nThere is an apple at (1,3).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (4, 2), I eat the apple at (4, 2). This grows my snake.\nAfter growing, my head is at (4, 2) and my tail (currently non-existent or effectively length 1) will be at (4, 1).\nThis position (4, 2) is open. I can then plan to move towards the cluster at (2,2) or (2,0).\nFrom (4, 2), I can go Left to (3, 2), then Left to (2, 2).\nFrom (4, 2), I can go Down to (4, 1), but that's my previous body segment (if I grow, the tail moves, so (4, 1) becomes body). Actually, if I move UP to (4, 2) and eat an apple, I grow. My head becomes (4, 2). My body becomes (4, 1). So I cannot move back DOWN immediately.\nThis restriction is fine; I will look to go Left or Down-Left in the next turn.\n\nLet's evaluate the immediate threat. The enemy is at (5, 4). The most logical move for them is to the adjacent apple at (6, 4) or perhaps (5, 2) or (5, 6). If they move to (6, 4), they are safely away from me. If they move to (5, 2), they are close to me. If they move to (5, 5), they are safe.\nIf I move UP to (4, 2), I secure a point and grow. This is a positive action.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 0), I am safe but don't get an apple immediately.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 1), I move towards the (2, 0) and (2, 2) apples.\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 1), I move towards the enemy's potential path (if they go down to 5,2).\n\nMoving UP to (4, 2) seems the most aggressive and beneficial start. It grabs an apple and positions me at y=2. The enemy is at y=4. The distance is 2 vertical units. If the enemy moves Down to (5, 3), we are at distance 1.5. If the enemy moves Down to (5, 2), we are adjacent. This would be dangerous. However, the enemy has apples at (5, 6) and (6, 4) directly accessible. It is unlikely they will blindly rush down to (5, 2) without seeing the apples above and to the right. Even if they do, I will be at (4, 2) and they at (5, 2). I can move Left to (3, 2) next turn, securing my safety and moving toward (2, 2).\n\nTherefore, **UP** is the best move. It gains a point, grows the snake, and starts a path toward the western apples.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nSecure the apple at (4, 2). Observe enemy movement. Move Left towards (3, 2) or Down-Left towards (3, 1) depending on the enemy's new position, aiming for the (2, 2) and (2, 0) apples.\n\nUP",

To avoid being \"under\" the enemy?\n        *   The enemy is at (6, 4). Being at (5, 2) puts me South of the enemy's body Y-level.\n        *   The enemy's body is at y=4. My y=2.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3), y=3.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 2), y=2. (Same Y as me, but X=6 vs X=5). Not colliding.\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 2), and I move RIGHT to (5, 2) (already there), and they move to (6, 2), distance is 1. Safe.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (3, 2), I am further from the enemy.\n\n    *   **The \"War\" aspect:**\n        *   The enemy has 1 apple. I have 0.\n        *   I should eat.\n        *   The apple at (5, 2) is the closest accessible apple (Distance 1).\n        *   (2, 2) is distance 2.\n        *   (2, 0) is distance 2 + 2 = 4 steps (Manhattan: |4-2| + |2-0| = 2+2=4).\n        *   (5, 2) is |4-5| + |2-2| = 1.\n\n    *   **Trapping myself?**\n        *   If I go to (5, 2), and the enemy moves to (5, 3) somehow? No, enemy is at (6, 4). To get to (5, 3), they need 2 turns.\n        *   If I go to (5, 2), and the enemy moves to (6, 3) (Down).\n        *   My previous position is (4, 2). I will have a body segment there if I eat an apple.\n        *   Wait, I didn't eat an apple at (4, 2). I am still length 1.\n        *   If I move to (5, 2) and eat an apple, I grow.\n        *   My body will be (4, 2).\n        *   Next turn, I can move from (5, 2) to (5, 1), (5, 3), (4, 2) [Tail], or (6, 2).\n        *   (4, 2) will be occupied by my own tail (which is safe to move into if it's the *only* body segment, but since I ate, I grow. The tail moves from (4, 2) to... wait.\n        *   Current Head: (4, 2). No body.\n        *   Move to (5, 2). Eat Apple.\n        *   New Head: (5, 2).\n        *   New Body: [(4, 2)].\n        *   Tail: (4, 2).\n        *   Next turn, if I move LEFT to (4, 2), I am moving into my tail. This is allowed *only if* I don't grow that turn. But (4, 2) will be my tail.\n        *   So (4, 2) is a valid move to enter (it's the tail).\n        *   However, (5, 2) neighbors:\n            *   (5, 1): Empty\n            *   (5, 3): Empty\n            *   (4, 2): My future tail\n            *   (6, 2): Empty\n        *   It is a safe and flexible position.\n\n    *   **Is there a better option?**\n        *   (2, 2) is in a cluster. But (5, 2) is guaranteed *now*.\n        *   If I don't take (5, 2), the enemy might see it. They are 2 moves away. I am 1 move away.\n        *   Taking the apple secures growth.\n\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:**\n        *   Enemy at (6, 4).\n        *   Apples near enemy: (5, 6) [Up], (9, 4) [Right], (5, 2) [Down-Left].\n        *   Enemy might go UP to (6, 5) to get closer to (5, 6) or (9, 4).\n        *   Enemy might go RIGHT to (7, 4) to get to (9, 4).\n        *   Enemy might go DOWN to (6, 3) to get to (5, 2).\n        *   If enemy goes DOWN to (6, 3):\n            *   I am at (5, 2).\n            *   Distance: |6-5| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n            *   We are diagonal. Safe.\n        *   If I go to (5, 2) and enemy goes DOWN to (6, 2) (impossible in 1 turn, needs 2 turns: (6,4)->(6,3)->(6,2)).\n        *   So (5, 2) is safe from collision next turn.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n        *   Board boundaries: (5, 2) is valid (0-9).\n        *   Self collision: No body.\n        *   Enemy collision: Enemy body at (5, 4). I am at (5, 2). Not colliding.\n        *   Enemy head collision: Enemy at (6, 4). They can't reach (5, 2) in 1 turn.\n\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT to (5, 2) is the optimal move. It gets an apple, grows the snake, and prepares for the next move.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 2) to eat the apple. This grows my snake. My body will be at (4, 2). I will look to move DOWN to (5, 1) or LEFT to (4, 2) [Tail] or (6, 2) depending on the enemy's new position. The goal is to continue moving towards the cluster of apples in the bottom-left (2, 0) or (2, 2) while maintaining safety.\n\nRIGHT",

So (5, 1) is an apple.\n        *   So (5, 1) is safe (Apple).\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n        *   (4, 2) is currently occupied by my body (tail).\n        *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body is death.\n        *   Exception: If the tail moves out of the way *simultaneously*. Since my length is 2, my tail is (4, 2). If I eat an apple *this turn*, my tail (4, 2) will stay, and I will grow. If I *don't* eat an apple, my tail (4, 2) moves to (5, 2) (my current head).\n        *   However, if I move LEFT to (4, 2) and do *not* eat an apple, I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my tail. Since my head moves to (4, 2) and my tail moves to (5, 2), the move is valid *only if* I don't eat an apple.\n        *   If I eat an apple at (4, 2), I grow. My tail stays at (4, 2).

If they move LEFT, they hit their body.\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3), they might be chasing (8, 3) or (5, 2) (gone).\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (7, 5), they chase (5, 6).\n    *   **Option Analysis:**\n        *   **UP (5, 3):**\n            *   Targets apple at (4, 3) or (5, 6) or (3, 4).\n            *   (5, 3) is empty.\n            *   Next turn options from (5, 3): (5, 4) [Empty], (5, 2) [My tail], (4, 3) [Apple], (6, 3) [Empty].\n            *   This puts me closer to the center and enemy territory (y=4).\n            *   Risk: Enemy might move DOWN to (7, 3) or (6, 3). If Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3) and I am at (5, 3), we are diagonal (safe). If Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3), we are far.\n            *   If Enemy moves UP to (7, 5), we are distance 2.\n        *   **DOWN (5, 1):**\n            *   Target apple at (5, 1) or (2, 0).\n            *   (5, 1) contains an apple `A`.\n            *   Eating (5, 1) grows me. My body becomes [(5, 2), (4, 2)].\n            *   Moving DOWN puts me at y=1. Enemy is at y=4. Distance increases.\n            *   Bottom of board is y=0. Down is a \"dead end\" direction eventually, but (5, 1) is not a corner yet.\n            *   Neighbors from (5, 1): (5, 0) [Empty], (5, 2) [My future tail], (4, 1) [Empty], (6, 1) [Empty].\n            *   This is very safe.\n        *   **LEFT (4, 2):**\n            *   (4, 2) is my tail. No apple.\n            *   Move is valid (tail shifts to (5, 2)).\n            *   Moves me closer to (2, 2) and (2, 0).\n            *   Next turn from (4, 2): (4, 3), (4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2) [Tail].\n            *   This keeps me on the \"floor\" of the safe zone.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n            *   (6, 2) is empty.\n            *   Moves me East. Apples in East are (9, 2) and (8, 3).\n            *   Enemy is at (7, 4). Moving to (6, 2) puts me closer to the enemy (distance |7-6| + |4-2| = 3).\n            *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3), distance is |7-6| + |3-2| = 2.\n            *   If Enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (can't).\n            *   Moving RIGHT brings me into the \"danger zone\" where the enemy is hovering.\n            *   Enemy's body is at (6, 4). If I go to (6, 2), I am under the enemy's body.\n            *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3) (its own body is at 6,4, so it can't move left into (5,4) if that's occupied, but can move DOWN).\n            *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3), and I am at (6, 2), we are vertical neighbors. Safe.\n            *   However, if Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3) and I move RIGHT to (6, 2), we are safe.\n            *   But, if Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3), and I move UP to (6, 3) next turn? Collision.\n            *   Staying away from the enemy is generally better.\n\n3.  **Comparison of Options:**\n    *   **UP (5, 3)**: Centrally located. Good for future flexibility. Slight risk of proximity to enemy (who is at y=4).\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1)**: Guaranteed apple at (5, 1). Safe. Moves away from enemy. Eases pressure from top side. Allows access to (2, 0) or (5, 0).\n    *   **LEFT (4, 2)**: Safe. No apple. Moves towards left cluster. Conserves move (no growth).\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2)**: Safe. No apple. Moves towards enemy territory (East). Less safe than DOWN or UP regarding enemy proximity.\n\n    *   **Decision Factor:**\n        *   I have 1 apple. Enemy has 1 apple.\n        *   I need to grow.\n        *   (5, 1) is a guaranteed apple.\n        *   (5, 1) is directly away from the enemy (who is at y=4). This is advantageous for safety.\n        *   From (5, 1), I can move to (4, 1), (6, 1), or (5, 0) next turn. All are currently empty.\n        *   The enemy is unlikely to chase me to y=1 immediately, as they have apples at y=3, y=4, y=6.\n        *   Eating at (5, 1) grows my snake, increasing length. While longer snakes can be harder to maneuver, length 3 is still very flexible.\n        *   **Verdict:** DOWN to (5, 1) is the strongest move. It secures a point, puts distance between me and the enemy, and opens up the bottom-left quadrant for future turns.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 1) to eat the apple.

Their previous move from (7, 4) to (8, 4) suggests they are moving East.\n  - Apples nearby for enemy: (9, 4) is immediately to their right. (8, 3) is down. (7, 8) is up.\n  - If they move to (9, 4) next, they grow.\n  - If they move down to (8, 3), they are closer to the center but also closer to my potential path (I am at y=1).\n  - The enemy is far away (Manhattan distance: |8-5| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6). There is no immediate threat of collision.\n\n- **Option Analysis:**\n  - **UP (5, 2):** Invalid (suicide).\n  - **DOWN (5, 0):**\n    *   (5, 0) is an empty space.\n    *   This moves me further away from the enemy and the central chaos (y=4).\n    *   From (5, 0), I have access to (4, 0), (6, 0), and (5, 1) (my tail).\n    *   (5, 1) is now an empty space.\n    *   (5, 0) is on the bottom edge. This is a potential \"dead end\" if I get trapped, but with only length 3, I have plenty of maneuvering room. I can move to (4, 0) or (6, 0) next turn to turn the corner.\n    *   There is an apple at (2, 0) and (9, 0). Moving to (5, 0) keeps me aligned with the bottom row apples.\n  - **LEFT (4, 1):**\n    *   Moves towards the left side of the board.\n    *   (4, 1) is empty.\n    *   This brings me closer to apples at (2, 0) and (2, 2).\n    *   From (4, 1), I can move to (3, 1), (5, 1), (4, 2), or (4, 0).\n    *   (4, 2) is currently occupied by my body (the tail segment at (4, 2) will move to (5, 2)). So (4, 2) will be empty next turn. However, moving to (4, 2) would mean moving into the space my tail just left. This is valid *if* I don't eat an apple there (I won't, there's no apple at (4, 2)). But (4, 1) is safer for now.\n  - **RIGHT (6, 1):**\n    *   Moves towards the right side.\n    *   (6, 1) is empty.\n    *   This moves me closer to the enemy (distance becomes |8-6| + |4-1| = 5).\n    *   There are apples at (9, 0) and (9, 2).\n    *   However, moving right puts me directly under the enemy's territory (x=8, y=4). If the enemy decides to drop down to (8, 3) or (7, 3), we could be in closer proximity.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing DOWN vs. LEFT vs. RIGHT:\n- **LEFT** is good for chasing the left-side apples ((2, 0), (2, 2)).\n- **DOWN** is good for securing the bottom row and maintaining distance from the enemy.\n- **RIGHT** is riskier because it reduces the distance to the enemy.\n\nSince I ate the apple at (5, 1), I am now length 3. I need to be careful not to trap myself. Moving DOWN to (5, 0) is a valid, safe move. It keeps me on the bottom edge, which is often easier to navigate than the center. From (5, 0), I can easily pivot Left to (4, 0) or (3, 0) to head towards the (2, 0) apple, or Right to (6, 0) and (7, 0) to head towards (9, 0).\n\nThe bottom row is currently empty. Moving DOWN to (5, 0) utilizes that empty space and positions me to collect the apple at (2, 0) or (9, 0) in the coming turns. It also ensures I am not moving into the \"middle\" where the enemy is patrolling.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 0). From there, I will likely move LEFT to (4, 0) to head towards the (2, 0) apple, keeping the enemy at a safe distance on the upper half of the board.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The apple at (9, 4) from Turn 3 is gone from the board (replaced by `.` in the Turn 4 board state).

The enemy must have eaten it last turn (Turn 3) and moved to (8, 5) this turn (Turn 4). So Enemy is now Length 4.\n\n**Safety Check (Simulated for Turn 4):**\n1.  **UP to (5, 1):**\n    *   This is occupied by my own body (the segment at (5, 1) currently). This is a collision. **DEADLY.**\n2.  **DOWN to (5, -1):**\n    *   This is outside the board (y < 0). **DEADLY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n    *   Row 0: `. . A . . 0 . . .

A`\n    *   (6, 0) is `.` (empty).\n    *   My body will be at (5, 1) and (5, 2).\n    *   This is safe.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- **Enemy Analysis:**\n  - Enemy is at (8, 5). They just ate at (9, 4) and grew. They are likely looking for more food.\n  - Apples nearby for enemy: (9, 2), (9, 0), (8, 3), (7, 8), (2, 8).\n  - The enemy is at y=5, x=8. I am at y=0, x=5. Distance is |8-5| + |5-0| = 8.\n  - The enemy is far enough that immediate collision is unlikely unless we both move aggressively toward each other.\n\n- **Option Analysis:**\n  - **UP (5, 1):** Invalid (suicide).\n  - **DOWN (5, -1):** Invalid (off-board).\n  - **LEFT (4, 0):**\n    *   Moves towards the left side of the board.\n    *   (4, 0) is empty.\n    *   There is an apple at (2, 0). Moving Left puts me 2 steps closer to it.\n    *   From (4, 0), I can move to (3, 0), (4, 1), or (5, 0) (tail).\n    *   (5, 0) will be empty next turn (my tail moves to (5, 1)).\n    *   This is a very safe and productive move.\n  - **RIGHT (6, 0):**\n    *   Moves towards the right side of the board.\n    *   (6, 0) is empty.\n    *   There is an apple at (9, 0). Moving Right puts me 3 steps closer to it.\n    *   From (6, 0), I can move to (7, 0), (6, 1), or (5, 0) (tail).\n    *   However, the enemy is at (8, 5). The apple at (9, 0) is directly below the right wall.\n    *   If I go Right, I might clash with the enemy if they decide to drop down to the bottom right corner.\n    *   Checking the board for potential traps: (9, 0) is an apple. (9, 1) is `.`. (9, 2) is `A`. The right side is potentially dangerous if the enemy pivots down.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing LEFT vs. RIGHT:\n- **LEFT** leads to (2, 0) which is an apple. The path seems relatively clear. Row 0 is open on the left side.\n- **RIGHT** leads to (9, 0) which is an apple. However, the enemy is closer to the right side (x=8) than to the left side (x=0). Engaging near the enemy is risky.\n- **Current State:** My snake is at (5, 0). The bottom row (Row 0) is mostly empty on the left. Row 0: `. . A . . . . . . A` at indices 0-9. Indices 0, 1 are `.`. Index 2 is `A`. Index 3, 4 are `.`. Index 5 is me. Index 6, 7, 8 are `.`. Index 9 is `A`.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 0) puts me at x=4. Next turn I can go to (3, 0) or (2, 0) (Apple).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 0) puts me at x=6. Next turn I can go to (7, 0) or (9, 0) (Apple).\n- Distance to apples:\n  - (2, 0): Distance 3. (Path: (4,0)->(3,0)->(2,0)).\n  - (9, 0): Distance 4. (Path: (6,0)->(7,0)->(8,0)->(9,0)).\n- The enemy at (8, 5) is much closer to the right-side apples ((9, 0), (9, 2)). To avoid conflict and potential head-on collisions in the future, I should prioritize the left-side apple (2, 0).\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 0). This positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (2, 0) in two turns. It also keeps me away from the enemy's current location and likely path (which seems to be the right side/upper board).\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Analyze Current State**\n*   **Board:** 10x10, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Length 3. Head at (4, 0). Body at [(5, 0), (5, 1)].\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Length 4. Head at (9, 5). Body at [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4)].\n*   **Apples:** (2, 0), (9, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 2), (8, 3), (3, 4), (9, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (9, 0), (5, 6), (2, 8), (7, 8), (6, 3).\n*   **My Score:** 2. **Enemy Score:** 2. (Tied).\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves (Safety & Strategy)**\n\n*   **UP to (4, 1):**\n    *   *Board State Check:* The cell (4, 1) is empty (marked as `.` in row 1: `1 . . . . T . . . .`). It is not an apple.\n    *   *Body Collision:* My body will shift to [(4, 0), (5, 0)]. (4, 1) is clear.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* (4, 1) is a safe middle-ground but offers no immediate apple. It positions me to access (3, 4), (5, 6), or (6, 3) later.\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* The enemy is at (9, 5). Moving UP moves me away from the bottom wall but brings me closer to the center vertically.\n\n*   **DOWN to (4, -1):**\n    *   *Collision Check:* This is outside the board (y < 0).\n    *   *Result:* **DEADLY.** Invalid move.\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 0):**\n    *   *Board State Check:* Row 0 is `. . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n    *   *Body Collision:* My body shifts to [(4, 0), (5, 0)]. (3, 0) is clear.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* This is a direct path to the apple at (2, 0). From (3, 0), I can eat (2, 0) on the next turn.\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* The enemy is far away (x=9).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 0):**\n    *   *Board State Check:* Row 0 index 5 is currently `T` (my tail).\n    *   *Body Collision Rule:* Moving into the cell directly behind the head (the tail) is allowed *if* the tail moves away on the same turn. However, standard snake rules (and the prompt's specific warning \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\") often forbid this. Even if valid, (5, 0) is my current tail. It will move to (5, 1) when I move. However, looking at the provided Board State for Turn 5:\n        `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        My head is at (4, 0) (represented by `0` at index 4).\n        My body is at (5, 0) (represented by `T` at index 5).\n        My body is at (5, 1) (represented by `T` at index 5 of row 1).\n        If I move RIGHT to (5, 0), I am moving into my own body segment. Even if the tail moves, this is considered a collision in most snake implementations (similar to moving backwards).\n    *   *Safety:* High risk of self-collision. The prompt explicitly warns against moving backwards into your own body. While the tail *physically* moves, standard logic treats this as a collision to prevent trapping. Given the strict \"think hard about body\" prompt, assuming this is unsafe is prudent.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* (9, 0) is an apple, but (5, 0) is occupied by my body. Even if the move were technically legal by strict movement mechanics (head moves to old tail position, tail moves away), it offers no immediate food and is risky.\n\n**3. Decision**\nComparing **UP** and **LEFT**:\n*   **UP** keeps me in the center (4, 1). I have no immediate food target. The enemy is at (9, 5), so distance is large.\n*   **LEFT** moves me to (3, 0). This is 1 step closer to the apple at (2, 0). The bottom row (Row 0) is very open on the left side (empty cells at x=0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n*   Moving LEFT secures a guaranteed growth in 2 turns (3, 0 -> 2, 0). Moving UP requires searching for food (e.g., going up to (4, 4) for (3, 4)).\n*   The enemy snake is on the right side (x=8,9). Avoiding the right side and staying on the left is safer and splits the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move LEFT to (3, 0) to approach the apple at (2, 0). From there, I can eat (2, 0) next turn, grow, and then decide whether to sweep the bottom row or head up into the open spaces.\n\nLEFT",

A`\n        Indices: 0(`.`)1(`.`)2(`A`)3(`.`)4(`0`)5(`T`)...\n        \n        Wait, the Rationale says: `My head is at (4, 0) (represented by 0 at index 4).`\n        So in the previous turn board: `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        Index 4 was `0` (Head at 4,0).\n        Index 5 was `T` (Body at 5,0).\n        \n        Current Turn Board (Turn 6):\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If the head was at (4,0) and moved LEFT (as the rationale says \"My last move information: LEFT\"), then the head moves to (3,0).\n        The body shifts.\n        \n        Let's re-examine the *Current* Board State string provided in the prompt for Row 0:\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If the head is at (3,0), and the body is at (4,0) and (5,0):\n        Index 3: Should be Head (`0`).\n        Index 4: Should be Body (`T`).\n        Index 5: Should be Body (`T`).\n        \n        The string `0 . . A . T T . . A` has `A` at index 3.\n        \n        **Hypothesis:** The prompt text description is the source of truth, and the board string might be slightly misaligned or I am misparsing the string formatting.\n        \n        However, looking at the *previous* turn board in the Rationale:\n        `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        This string has `0` at index 4.\n        \n        Current turn board:\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        Let's look at the indices again.\n        Previous: `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A` (Length 11? No, standard 10x10).\n        Previous string in rationale: `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        Wait, the user's rationale board string: `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        Indices: 0(`.`)1(`.`)2(`A`)3(`.`)4(`0`)5(`T`)6(`.`)7(`.`)8(`.`)9(`A`).\n        If index 4 is `0` and Head is (4,0), that fits.\n        \n        Current string: `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        Indices: 0(`0`)1(`.`)2(`.`)3(`A`)4(`.`)5(`T`)6(`T`)7(`.`)8(`.`)9(`A`).\n        \n        If I moved LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0):\n        My head moves to (3,0).\n        My body moves to (4,0) and (5,0) -> (Wait, old body was at (5,0) and (5,1) according to Rationale? No, Rationale said: `Body: [(5, 0), (5, 1)]`. Wait, Rationale said: `My snake (ID 0): Length 3. Head at (4, 0). Body at [(5, 0), (5, 1)].` in step 1.\n        But in the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section, the user history says:\n        **START LAST MOVE PICK**\n        LEFT\n        **END LAST MOVE PICK**\n        \n        So, previous Head was (4,0). I moved LEFT.\n        New Head: (3,0).\n        Previous Body: [(5,0), (5,1)].\n        New Body: [(4,0), (5,0)].\n        \n        So on the board, (3,0) should be `0`, (4,0) should be `T`, (5,0) should be `T`.\n        \n        Let's look at the *Current* Board string for row 0 again:\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        Let's map indices:\n        0: `0`\n        1: `.`\n        2: `.`\n        3: `A`\n        4: `.`\n        5: `T`\n        6: `T`\n        ...\n        \n        If index 3 is `A` (Apple), then (3,0) is an apple, not empty.\n        If I move to (3,0), I eat the apple.\n        \n        But wait, the prompt's description of the board says: `Board state: ... 0 . . A . T T . . . A`.\n        Is it possible the `0` represents the head, and the layout is shifted?\n        \n        Let's rely on the textual description of coordinates provided in the prompt's \"Your snake\" section, which is usually authoritative over the ASCII map if there's a conflict, *but* the ASCII map is the visual ground truth.\n        \n        Prompt: `Head: (3, 0)`\n        Prompt: `Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0)]`\n        \n        Prompt Board Row 0: `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If (3,0) is the head, then index 3 should be `0`.\n        If (4,0) is body, index 4 should be `T`.\n        If (5,0) is body, index 5 should be `T`.\n        \n        The string provided: `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        Index 0: `0`\n        Index 3: `A`\n        \n        This suggests the ASCII map has the head at (0,0) and an apple at (3,0).\n        However, the text explicitly states `(3,0)` is the head.\n        \n        Let's look at the *previous* turn's board in the Rationale again.\n        Rationale says: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        Wait, the Rationale text says: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Wait, let's re-read that part of the Rationale carefully.\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Wait, the Rationale text provided by the user says:\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Actually, looking at the string ` . . A . . . . . . A`:\n        Index 0: `.`\n        Index 1: `.`\n        Index 2: `A`\n        Index 3: `.`\n        \n        So in the *previous* turn, (3,0) was empty.\n        \n        Now in the *current* turn, the board is:\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If the text says Head is at (3,0), and the board shows `0` at index 0, there is a conflict.\n        \n        **However**, let's look at the rest of the board string.\n        Row 5: `A . . . . . . . T T`\n        Row 4: `. . . A . . . . T 1`\n        \n        Enemy Snake #1 is at Head: (9,4).\n        Row 4, index 9 is `1`. That matches.\n        \n        My Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0)].\n        Row 0: `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        Index 4: `.`\n        Index 5: `T`\n        \n        If my body is at (4,0) and (5,0), then index 4 should be `T` and index 5 should be `T`.\n        The string has `.` at index 4 and `T` at index 5.\n        \n        **Possibility:** The text description `Head: (3,0), Body: [(4,0), (5,0)]` is correct, and the ASCII map is slightly shifted or I am misinterpreting the ASCII map's alignment.\n        \n        Let's look at the ASCII map again.\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        If we assume `0` is at (3,0), then the string would be ` . . . 0 . T T . . A`.\n        The provided string is `0 . . A . T T . . A`.\n        \n        **Let's try another interpretation.**\n        Is it possible the `0` is a placeholder for the row number?\n        No, the rows are numbered 9 to 0 on the left.\n        \n        Let's look at the *Previous* Turn's board in the Rationale again.\n        `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        Wait, the user's Rationale text says:\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Wait, I am misreading the Rationale text provided by the user.\n        User's Rationale text:\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Wait, the string ` . . A . . . . . . A` has `A` at index 2.\n        Index 0: `.`\n        Index 1: `.`\n        Index 2: `A`\n        Index 3: `.`\n        \n        So (3,0) was empty in the previous turn.\n        \n        Current Turn board:\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If the head moved LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0):\n        New Head: (3,0).\n        Old Head (4,0) becomes body.\n        Old Body (5,0) becomes body.\n        \n        So the board should show:\n        (3,0): `0`\n        (4,0): `T`\n        (5,0): `T`\n        \n        The ASCII map shows:\n        Index 3: `A`\n        Index 4: `.`\n        Index 5: `T`\n        \n        This implies (3,0) is an apple, (4,0) is empty, and (5,0) is body.\n        \n        **CRITICAL CONTRADICTION:**\n        The text says Head is (3,0). The map says Index 3 is `A`.\n        The text says Body is (4,0). The map says Index 4 is `.`.\n        The text says Body is (5,0). The map says Index 5 is `T`.\n        \n        **Resolution Strategy:**\n        When text and ASCII map conflict, which is the source of truth?\n        In Snake games, the board state is the physical reality.\n        However, the prompt explicitly states: `Head: (3, 0)`.\n        \n        Let's look at the *previous* turn's board in the Rationale again.\n        The Rationale says: `Row 0 is . .

No, row numbers are on the left.\n        \n        **Let's look at the *Previous* Turn's board in the Rationale:**\n        `0 . . A . 0 T . . .

A mistake in the prompt.\n        2. Referring to a coordinate system I don't understand.\n        3.

A`.\n        The text says: `Head: (3, 0)`.\n        \n        Let's look at the previous turn's map in the Rationale again.\n        Rationale: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . .

A`\n        Characters: `0` `.` `.` `A` `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `A`\n        If `0` is at index 3, then the string is ` . . . 0 . T T . . A`.\n        The provided string is `0 . . A . T T . . A`.\n        \n        **There is no way to make `0 . . A . T T . . A` mean `0` is at index 3.**\n        \n        **Let's look at the *previous* turn's map again.**\n        The Rationale text says: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A`.\n        Wait, I am reading the user's Rationale.\n        It says: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9).\n        \n        Wait, the user's Rationale says:\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9).\n        \n        Let's look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" block. It doesn't have the board.\n        \n        **Okay, I have to make a choice.**\n        \n        1. **Trust the Text Description:** Head at (3,0). Body at (4,0), (5,0).\n           - Move LEFT to (2,0) -> Eat Apple. Safe.\n           - Move RIGHT to (4,0) -> Die (Body collision).\n           - Move UP to (3,1) -> Safe.\n           - Move DOWN -> Die.\n        \n        2. **Trust the ASCII Map:** Head at (0,0). Body at (5,0), (6,0).\n           - Move RIGHT to (1,0) -> Safe.\n           - Move UP to (0,1) -> Safe.\n           - Move LEFT -> Die.\n           - Move DOWN -> Die.\n        \n        **Which is more likely?**\n        - The text description `Head: (3,0)` is very specific.\n        - The ASCII map `0 . . A . T T . . A` is also specific.\n        - However, the text description is consistent with the move \"LEFT\" from the previous turn (Head was at 4,0, moved Left, now at 3,0).\n        - The ASCII map is NOT consistent with the move \"LEFT\" from 4,0 (it puts the head at 0,0).\n        \n        **If the ASCII map is correct, my previous move \"LEFT\" (from 4,0) was illegal or moved me to 0,0? No.**\n        \n        **Conclusion:** The ASCII map in the prompt has a visual error or I am misinterpreting the visual representation of `0`.\n        However, looking at the board string again: `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        Is it possible the `0` is at index 3 and the string is just displayed poorly?\n        No, `0 . . A` clearly shows `0` at start.\n        \n        **Let's look at the Enemy Snake again.**\n        Enemy Head: (9,4).\n        Map: `. . . A . . . . T 1` (Row 4).\n        Index 9 is `1`. Correct.\n        \n        **Let's look at my snake again.**\n        Text: Head (3,0).\n        \n        **Is there any other clue?**\n        The prompt says: `Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.`\n        \n        **Let's assume the Text Description is correct and the ASCII map is shifted or I am misreading the ASCII map.**\n        \n        **Wait, look at the prompt's \"Board state\" string again.**\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If I delete the first character, I get `. . A . T T . . A`.\n        That's 9 characters. Needs 10.\n        \n        **Let's consider the possibility that the `0` is at (3,0).**\n        If `0` is at (3,0), then the string `0 . . A . T T . . A` must be interpreted as:\n        Index 0: `.`\n        Index 1: `.`\n        Index 2: `.`\n        Index 3: `0`\n        ...\n        \n        But the string explicitly starts with `0`.\n        \n        **Let's look at the *previous* turn's board in the Rationale again.**\n        `0 . . A . 0 T . . . A`\n        (Wait, the user's Rationale text says `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A`).\n        \n        There is a conflict between the user's Rationale text description of the board and the visual map in the prompt.\n        \n        **Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text again.**\n        It says: `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A` (indices 0-9). Index 3 (x=3) is `.` (empty).\n        \n        Wait, the string ` . . A . . . . . . A`:\n        Indices: 0(`.`)1(`.`)2(`A`)3(`.`)4(`.`)5(`.`)...\n        \n        So in the previous turn, (3,0) was empty.\n        My head was at (4,0).\n        I moved LEFT.\n        I arrived at (3,0).\n        \n        So in the current turn, (3,0) is my head.\n        \n        **Current Turn Map: `0 . . A . T T . . A`**\n        If I am at (3,0), then index 3 should be `0`.\n        The map shows `A` at index 3.\n        \n        **This implies the map in the prompt is from the *previous* turn?**\n        No, the prompt says \"Turn: 6\".\n        \n        **Let's look at the map again.**\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        **What if the `0` is at index 4?**\n        No, the string is `0 . . A . T T . .

A`).\n        \n        **Okay, I will trust the Text Description over the ASCII Map because:**\n        1. The Text Description is consistent with the move history (Head moved from 4,0 to 3,0).\n        2. The ASCII Map puts the head at (0,0), which contradicts the move history.\n        3. The ASCII Map puts the apple at (3,0), which would mean I am moving *onto* the apple if I am at (3,0).\n        \n        **So, if I am at (3,0):**\n        - **LEFT (2,0):** Apple. Safe.\n        - **RIGHT (4,0):** Body. Dead.\n        - **UP (3,1):** Empty. Safe.\n        - **DOWN:** Off board. Dead.\n        \n        **Between LEFT and UP:**\n        LEFT gives an apple (growth + score).\n        UP gives empty space.\n        \n        LEFT is the superior move.\n        \n        **Double check: Is (2,0) safe from enemy?**\n        Enemy is at (9,4). Moving (0,1) or (0,-1) or (-1,0) or (1,0).\n        He cannot reach (2,0) this turn.\n        \n        **Double check: Is (4,0) safe?**\n        It is my body. Moving there is death.\n        \n        **Final Decision:**\n        Move LEFT to (2,0) to eat the apple.\n        \n        **Wait, let's check the ASCII map one more time.**\n        `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        If I am at (3,0), and I move LEFT to (2,0), and the map says index 2 is `.`, then (2,0) is empty.\n        But the prompt's apple list says (2,0) is an apple.\n        \n        **Conflict:**\n        Map: Index 2 is `.` (Empty).\n        List: (2,0) is an Apple.\n        \n        **Resolution:**\n        The Map is a visual representation of the board *state*.\n        The List is the configuration of the game.\n        If I eat an apple, it is removed from the list and the map.\n        \n        In the previous turn, (2,0) was an apple (based on Rationale: `Row 0 is . . A ...`).\n        In the current turn, if I haven't eaten it, it should still be there.\n        \n        If the Map shows `.` at index 2, does that mean the apple is gone?\n        Or does it mean the Map is wrong?\n        \n        **Let's look at the *previous* turn's board in the Rationale again.**\n        `Row 0 is . . A . . . . . . A`.\n        Index 2 is `A`.\n        \n        Current Map: `0 . . A . T T . . A`.\n        Index 2 is `.`.\n        \n        **Wait!**\n        Previous Map (Rationale): ` . . A . . . . . . A`\n        Current Map (Prompt): `0 . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If I remove the `0` from the current map (representing my head at 3,0), then:\n        ` . . A . T T . . A`\n        \n        If I am at (3,0), and my body is at (4,0), (5,0):\n        (3,0): `0`\n        (4,0): `T`\n        (5,0): `T`\n        \n        So the map should be:\n        ` . . 0 T T . . . A` (Wait, apple is at (2,0)? No, text says apple at (2,0)).\n        \n        **Let's look at the Apple List again.**\n        Apples at: (2, 0) ...\n        \n        **If the Map shows `.` at index 2, and the List shows (2,0) is an apple, then the Map is missing the apple.**\n        This happens if the map generation logic only shows snake bodies and heads, not apples? No, the map shows `A` elsewhere.\n        \n        **Look at the map: `0 . . A . T T . . A`**\n        Index 3 is `A`.

Safe.\n        2. **UP (3,1):** Safe.\n        3. **RIGHT (4,0):** Body. **DEAD.**\n        4. **DOWN:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n        \n        **Between LEFT and UP:**\n        LEFT gives an apple. UP does not.\n        \n        **Decision: LEFT.**\n        \n        **One final check:**\n        Is there any way (2,0) is unsafe?\n        Enemy is at (9,4). He moves one step. He cannot reach (2,0).\n        My body is at (4,0) and (5,0). (2,0) is clear.\n        \n        **Long-term plan:**\n        Eat the apple at (2,0). Grow to length 4.\n        Next turn, I will be at (2,0) with body at (3,0) and (4,0).\n        Apples remaining near me: (1,3), (2,2).\n        I can head towards (2,2) or (1,3).\n        \n        **Wait, I need to be careful.**\n        If I move LEFT, I eat the apple.\n        If I eat the apple, my tail grows.\n        \n        **Let's verify the \"Moving into your own body\" rule.**\n        \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n        \n        If I am at (3,0) and body is at (4,0), (5,0):\n        Moving RIGHT to (4,0) is moving into the cell directly behind the head.\n        This counts as death.\n        \n        So RIGHT is definitely out.\n        \n        **So, between LEFT and UP.**\n        LEFT = Apple.\n        UP = No Apple.\n        \n        LEFT is the best move.\n        \n        **Wait, look at the map string `0 . . A . T T . . A` one last time.**\n        If `0` is at (0,0), and I move RIGHT to (1,0), I am safe.\n        If `0` is at (0,0), and I move UP to (0,1), I am safe.\n        \n        **But the text says Head is (3,0).**\n        I must trust the text description of my own position. The map is just a visualization.\n        \n        **Decision: LEFT.**\n        \n        **Final check on the apple:**\n        Apples: (2, 0)...\n        Head: (3, 0).\n        LEFT moves to (2, 0).\n        This is an apple.\n        \n        **Is there any risk of head-on collision?**\n        Enemy is at (9, 4). He might move towards (9, 3) or (8, 4) or (9, 5).\n        He is nowhere near me.\n        \n        **Is there any risk of trapping myself?**\n        (2,0) is at the bottom edge.\n        From (2,0), I can go UP to (2,1), LEFT to (1,0), or RIGHT to (3,0) (which will be my body).\n        (1,0) is empty (based on previous map).\n        (2,1) is empty.\n        So I have options.\n        \n        **Conclusion:** LEFT is the optimal move. It gains a point and grows the snake.\n\nLEFT",

Analyze Current State and Discrepancies**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Text Description:** \"Head: (2, 0)\", \"Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]\".\n    *   **Previous Turn:** My head was at (3, 0). I moved LEFT (as per the provided \"Last Move Information\").\n    *   **Logic Check:** Moving LEFT from (3, 0) lands exactly on (2, 0). This confirms the text description is accurate.\n    *   **Board State Visuals:** The provided ASCII map shows `0` at index 0 for row 0 (`0 . . A . T T . . . A`), which conflicts with the head being at (2, 0). However, the textual coordinates (\"Head: (2, 0)\") and the move logic (Previous Head 3,0 -> Move LEFT -> New Head 2,0) are mutually consistent and precise. I will trust the coordinate descriptions and logic over the potentially misaligned ASCII visualization.\n    *   **Position:** Head is at (2, 0).\n    *   **Body:** (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0).\n    *   **Score:** 3.\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (9, 3).\n    *   **Body:** [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)].\n    *   **Score:** 3.\n    *   **Status:** The enemy is in the top-right corner.\n\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   Key apples near my position: **(1, 0)**, **(2, 0)**, **(2, 2)**, **(1, 3)**.\n    *   **Note:** The ASCII map shows an apple `A` at index 2 (x=2) for row 0. However, since I am *currently* at (2, 0) and haven't eaten yet (my score is still 3), (2, 0) cannot be an apple. If it were, my score would be 4 or I would be dead if I just ate. Therefore, the ASCII map's representation of apples at (2, 0) is likely outdated or incorrect for the current turn's logic. I will rely on the explicit list of apples provided in the prompt.\n    *   Looking at the apple list: (9, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 2), (8, 3), (3, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (9, 0), (5, 6), (2, 8), (7, 8), (6, 3), (3, 9), (0, 4).\n    *   **Wait, I need to double check the apple list provided at the start.**\n    *   **Apples at:** (9, 2), (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 2), (8, 3), (3, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (9, 0), (5, 6), (2, 8), (7, 8), (6, 3), (3, 9), (0, 4).\n    *   **Observation:** There is **no apple at (1, 0)** and **no apple at (2, 0)** in the explicit list. The ASCII map appears to show apples that may have been eaten or are errors. I must rely on the list provided in the prompt header. Since my score is 3 and I just moved, I assume I have not eaten an apple this turn unless I move onto one listed in the header.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves**\nI am at (2, 0). I need to check `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 2, -1):**\n    *   Y = -1 is off the board.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 0):**\n    *   My body is at (3, 0).\n    *   Moving into my own body is fatal.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 0):**\n    *   Is there an apple? Checking the list: (1, 0) is **not** listed.\n    *   Is it occupied? My body is at (3, 0) and (4, 0). Enemy is far away.\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but no immediate point gain.\n    *   **Future:** From (1, 0), I can go UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0). This keeps options open but (0, 0) is a corner.\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 1):**\n    *   Is there an apple? (2, 1) is **not** listed.\n    *   Is it occupied? No.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Future:** From (2, 1), I have UP, LEFT, RIGHT options (DOWN is back to (2, 0)). This is a central position with good connectivity.\n    *   **Proximity to Apples:** (2, 2) is 1 step away. (1, 3) is 2 steps away. (0, 4) is 3 steps away. (0, 5) is 4 steps away. (1, 6) is 5 steps away.\n    *   Moving UP puts me directly adjacent to the apple at (2, 2), which is a safe and valuable target.\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison (LEFT vs UP)**\n*   **LEFT (1, 0):**\n    *   Moves towards the corner (0, 0).\n    *   While (0, 5) and (0, 4) are to the left, moving to (1, 0) brings me closer to the wall.\n    *   If I go LEFT, my next move to (0, 0) puts me in a corner (trapped).\n    *   If I go LEFT, I can go UP to (1, 1), but I am still hugging the wall.\n*   **UP (2, 1):**\n    *   Maintains central positioning.\n    *   Creates a path to the cluster of apples at (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6).\n    *   Avoids the immediate danger of being cornered at (0, 0).\n    *   The enemy snake is at (9, 3). They are far away and likely targeting apples at (9, 0), (9, 2), (8, 3), (7, 8), etc. No collision threat here.\n\n**4. Decision**\nThe explicit apple list does not contain (1, 0) or (2, 0), meaning moving to (1, 0) gains nothing immediately and moves me toward a corner. Moving **UP** to (2, 1) positions me to collect the apple at (2, 2) next turn, or head towards the apple chain at (1, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (1, 6). The central path offers more long-term safety and scoring potential than hugging the left wall.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (2, 1). From there, move to (2, 2) next turn to eat the apple and gain a point. After that, navigate towards the cluster of apples at (0, 4) and (1, 3).\n\nUP",

Moving UP to (2, 2) places me directly on an apple. This position is safe because the enemy snake is far away in the top-right corner (around x=9, y=3). The area to my left and above is relatively open, allowing me to navigate towards the cluster of apples near (0, 5) and (1, 6) after eating. I must avoid getting trapped near the walls. Moving UP maintains central positioning and keeps my escape routes open to the left (towards 0,5) and down (towards 4,0) if needed.\n\n**Current Turn Analysis:**\n1.  **Position:** Head at (2, 1). Body at [(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)].\n2.  **Immediate Options:**\n    *   **UP (to 2, 2):** Leads to an apple (score increases to 4). Safe (empty cell). Good long-term positioning.\n    *   **LEFT (to 1, 1):** Safe. However, it moves me away from the immediate apple at (2, 2) and closer to the wall without gaining points. While (1, 3) and (0, 5) are in that direction, securing the point at (2, 2) first is more efficient.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 3, 1):** Safe, but leads to an empty cell and moves me away from the apple cluster at (2, 2) and (1, 3).\n    *   **DOWN (to 2, 0):** This is my tail. Moving backwards kills me.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (8, 3) with body segments at (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5). They are nowhere near my position (2, 1). There is no risk of collision this turn.\n3.  **Decision:** Moving **UP** is the optimal choice. It guarantees a point gain immediately and sets me up perfectly to target the next nearest apple at (1, 3) or the chain at (0, 5). I will not get trapped by moving UP.\n\nUP",

The apple at (1, 6) is also accessible, but (0, 4) is the immediate proximity target.\n*   **Pathing:** Moving **LEFT** to (0, 3) maintains the shortest path to the apple at (0, 4). It also keeps the path to (0, 5) open.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (0, 3) is the optimal move. It positions the head perfectly to collect the apple at (0, 4) next turn.

Wait, let's check the board state provided in the prompt).\n        *   *Re-checking Board:* The board shows `T` at (0, 2). Since I ate an apple at (0, 4) last turn (turn 11), my tail did not move.

Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **Only Viable Move:** UP to (0, 4).\n    *   **Safety:** It is the only move that does not result in immediate death (wall, own body).\n    *   **Reward:** It contains an apple. Eating it will increase my score to 6 and grow my length. This prevents my tail from moving next turn, which might be useful for blocking or maintaining position, but more importantly, it secures a point.\n    *   **Future Positioning:** Moving to (0, 4) places me next to another apple at (0, 5). From (0, 4), I can move UP to (0, 5) next turn.\n\n**3. Long-term Consideration:**\n*   The enemy snake is currently at (7, 6) and is not an immediate threat to my position on the left edge.\n*   There is a cluster of apples on the left side: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6).

That's the only option.\n    *   **Future:** From (0, 6), the only empty neighbor is (1, 6) or (0, 7). (0, 7) is empty. This path leads into the \"crowded\" area with many T's. (1, 6) is an apple. (1, 5) is an apple. (1, 4) is empty.\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (1, 4):**\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up movement significantly. (1, 4) connects to (2, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 3).\n    *   **Cons:** Does not eat an apple immediately.\n    *   **Next Turn from (1, 4):**\n        *   (2, 4) -> leads to (3, 4) (Apple).\n        *   (1, 5) -> (Apple).\n        *   (1, 3) -> currently a `T` (body), but by next turn, my tail (2, 0) moves, making (1, 3) empty (since I'm at 1,4).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **UP (0, 5)** is a \"greedy\" move. It locks me into a single-file line. I would be 7 long. My body occupies the column x=0 from y=0 to y=4. If I go UP to (0, 5), my body will be x=0 [0..4] + (0,5). If I then turn right to (1, 5) (an apple), I trap myself on the left wall unless my tail moves out of the way in time.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 4)** is a \"positional\" move. It moves me off the wall (x=0) and into the open board (x=1).\n        *   From (1, 4), I can go UP to (1, 5) (Apple).\n        *   From (1, 4), I can go RIGHT to (2, 4), then UP to (3, 4) (Apple).\n        *   From (1, 4), I can go RIGHT to (2, 4), then RIGHT to (3, 4), then UP to (3, 5), then UP to (3, 6), then LEFT to (2, 6).\n    *   The cluster of apples at (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 9) is more accessible if I am at x=1 or x=2 rather than trapped at x=0.\n    *   **Crucially:** The board shows \"T\" at (1, 5) and (1, 6) in the provided ASCII map. However, that map is static. My body currently occupies (0, 3), (1, 3)... so (1, 5) is actually empty. The map key is likely showing generic body parts, but the prompt text says `Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)]`. So (1, 5) is definitely empty.\n    *   **Safety:** If I go UP to (0, 5), I am pinned. If the enemy decides to rush left (unlikely but possible), or if I misjudge the tail timing, I die. If I go RIGHT to (1, 4), I have 2-3 escape routes.\n\n**3. Long-term Consideration:**\n*   Enemy is at (6, 6). They are occupied with the central apple (5, 6) or (7, 8).\n*   I want to clear the left-side apples (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 8) efficiently.\n*   The path **RIGHT -> UP -> RIGHT -> UP** (1,4 -> 1,5 -> 2,5 -> 3,5) leads to (3, 4) or (3, 6).\n*   The path **UP -> RIGHT** (0,5 -> 1,5) is also possible if I go UP now, but then I am at (0,5) with a single file line behind me. If I go RIGHT now to (1, 4), I approach (1, 5) from a more flexible angle.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to (1, 4) is the safer and more strategic play. It avoids getting stuck in a dead-end column and allows me to pivot towards the central-left apple cluster.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Tie game.\n    *   **Turn:** 14/150. Plenty of time.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves from Head (1, 4):**\n    *   **UP (1, 5):**\n        *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid (0-9).\n        *   **Collision Check:** Is (1, 5) in my body? No.\n        *   **Apple Check:** (1, 5) is `.` (Empty) according to the current board state.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Opens access to (1, 6) which is an apple, and (2, 5) which leads to the cluster. It keeps me relatively central.\n    *   **DOWN (1, 3):**\n        *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n        *   **Collision Check:** (1, 3) is in my body list. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 4):**\n        *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n        *   **Collision Check:** (0, 4) is in my body list (specifically the segment connecting to my tail). **DEADLY.**\n        *   *Note:* Even if it wasn't body, moving back to the wall is bad strategy (leads to immediate trap).\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 4):**\n        *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n        *   **Collision Check:** (2, 4) is not in my body.\n        *   **Apple Check:** (2, 4) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me right, towards the center. From (2, 4), I can access (3, 4) (Apple), (2, 5) (Empty), or (2, 3) (Empty).\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   **Head:** (5, 6).\n    *   **Body:** [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3)].\n    *   **Strategy:** They are at (5, 6) with an apple at (5, 6) and (6, 6) is blocked by their own body. They likely move UP to (5, 7), DOWN to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 6), or RIGHT to (6, 6) (which is body, so illegal). If they move UP to (5, 7), they threaten the apple at (5, 7).\n    *   **Distance to me:** They are far away (distance ~4-5 units). No immediate head-on collision threat unless I blindly path into them.\n\n4.  **Comparing UP (1, 5) vs RIGHT (2, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Both are technically safe this turn.\n    *   **Future Flexibility (The \"Trap\" Check):**\n        *   **If I go UP (1, 5):**\n            *   My body becomes: Head(1,5), Body(1,4), Body(0,4)...\n            *   Next turn options from (1, 5): (1, 6) [Apple], (2, 5), (1, 4) [Body].\n            *   This is a \"Cul-de-sac\" move. I am moving into a position where I only have 2 real exits (up or right). The \"Left\" option is blocked by my own tail (which takes time to clear).\n            *   I am forced to either go UP into (1, 6) or RIGHT into (2, 5).\n        *   **If I go RIGHT (2, 4):**\n            *   My body becomes: Head(2, 4), Body(1, 4), Body(0, 4)...\n            *   Next turn options from (2, 4): (3, 4) [Apple], (2, 5), (2, 3), (1, 4) [Body].\n            *   This gives me **3** distinct safe paths (Up, Right, Down). It keeps me more mobile and flexible. I am not pinned against a wall or a tight cluster.\n\n5.  **Apple Prioritization:**\n    *   My goal is to outlast the enemy.\n    *   The apples at (3, 4), (2, 8), (1, 6), (0, 5) are all reachable.\n    *   Moving RIGHT (2, 4) positions me perfectly to pivot towards (3, 4) or sweep up towards (2, 8) and (1, 6).\n    *   Moving UP (1, 5) forces me to commit to the x=1 column immediately, which is riskier if the enemy surprises me.\n\n6.  **Decision:**\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 4)** is the superior move. It maintains maximum flexibility, avoids boxing myself in, and keeps the central-left apples in play. It avoids the immediate trap of the \"single-file\" column.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (2, 4). From there, pivot UP to (2, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 4) to eat the apple at (3, 4). Use the center to outmaneuver Snake #1, who is currently occupied on the right side. Avoid the left wall until necessary.\n\nRIGHT",

I am trailing by 1.\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 7).\n- **Turn:** 15/150.\n\n**Evaluate Moves from Head (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 5):**\n    *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid (0-9).\n    *   **Collision Check:** (2, 5) is not in my body.\n    *   **Apple Check:** (2, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me closer to apples at (1, 6) and (2, 8). It maintains central positioning.\n\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):**\n    *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n    *   **Collision Check:** (2, 3) is not in my body.\n    *   **Apple Check:** (2, 3) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me down towards (2, 2) which is currently occupied by my tail. This move is risky because it pulls me into a narrow corridor. From (2, 3), I would be boxed in by my tail at (2, 2) and my body at (1, 3), (1, 2) below. This significantly reduces future mobility.\n\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):**\n    *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n    *   **Collision Check:** (1, 4) is in my body (it was my head in the previous turn). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **Verdict:** Invalid move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):**\n    *   **Coordinate Check:** Valid.\n    *   **Collision Check:** (3, 4) is not in my body.\n    *   **Apple Check:** (3, 4) is an **APPLE**. Eating this would increase my score to 7, tying me with the enemy.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me right. From (3, 4), I can access (4, 4), (3, 5), or (3, 3).\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\n- **DOWN (2, 3)** is the worst move because it forces me into a tight space (2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3) with very limited exits and risks trapping myself against my own tail. This reduces my ability to react to the enemy.\n- **UP (2, 5)** is a safe move that maintains mobility but does not gain an apple immediately. It keeps me in the center.\n- **RIGHT (3, 4)** is a safe move that gains an apple, putting me at 7 apples and tying the score. It moves me away from the wall and keeps access to the center of the board open.\n\nSince the enemy is at 7 apples and I am at 6, I need to close the gap. Eating the apple at (3, 4) is the priority. The move is safe (no collision with self or enemy). While the enemy is currently at (5, 7) and moving, (3, 4) is not an immediate collision risk for a head-on clash this turn based on their distance and likely movement patterns (they are near apples at (5, 6) and (5, 7)). Eating the apple provides the best path to winning while maintaining better mobility than the DOWN move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (3, 4) to tie the score. From there, assess the enemy's movement. If the enemy moves towards the cluster on the right, I should consider pivoting UP towards (2, 8) or (1, 6) to secure more apples while keeping the center accessible. Avoid getting trapped on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

I ate the apple at (3, 4) in the last move, so my score is now 7 (tying the enemy).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at head (6, 7), body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3)].\n\nBoard shows apples at: (9,2), (0,5), (1,6), (1,9), (9,0), (2,8), (7,8), (6,3), (3,9), (9,6), (4,5), (7,9), (3,6), (8,8), (8,6).\n\nMy body occupies: (3,4) head, (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nI need to evaluate each possible move from (3,4):\n\n**UP to (3,5):**\n- Check: (3,5) is within board (0-9 for both x,y).\n- Collision: (3,5) is not in my body list.\n- Apple: Looking at apples list - (3,5) is NOT an apple (apples at (3,6), (3,9), etc. but not (3,5)).\n- Strategic: This moves me toward apples at (3,6) and (2,8). (3,5) appears empty on board map. From (3,5), I could later go to (3,6) for an apple, or (4,5) which is an apple. This seems safe and opens up options.\n\n**DOWN to (3,3):**\n- Check: (3,3) is within board.\n- Collision: (3,3) is NOT in my body list (my body has (3,4) head, (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)). (3,3) appears empty.\n- Apple: (3,3) is NOT an apple.\n- Strategic: This moves down toward (3,2), (3,1), etc. Looking at board, (3,3) appears empty. However, my tail is at (2,2). Moving down to (3,3) keeps me in a relatively open area but away from the apple clusters. Also, note (6,3) is an apple to the right, but going down might not be optimal.\n\n**LEFT to (2,4):**\n- Check: (2,4) is within board.\n- Collision: (2,4) IS in my body! It's the second element in my body list. This would be moving into my own body (specifically, into the segment right behind my head). This is a death move. **Invalid.**\n\n**RIGHT to (4,4):**\n- Check: (4,4) is within board.\n- Collision: (4,4) is NOT in my body list.\n- Apple: (4,4) is NOT an apple (apples include (4,5) but not (4,4)).\n- Strategic: This moves right. From (4,4), I could go up to (4,5) which IS an apple, or right to (5,4), etc. This seems safe and keeps me moving toward the center-right area where there are apples.\n\nComparing UP (3,5) and RIGHT (4,4):\n- UP moves toward apples at (3,6) and (2,8) and keeps me in column 3.\n- RIGHT moves toward the apple at (4,5) and keeps me in row 4.\n- The enemy is at (6,7) and seems to be in the top-right area. I want to avoid direct confrontation while securing apples.\n- (4,5) is an apple that looks reachable from either direction, but RIGHT gets me closer to it directly.\n- UP to (3,5) is also safe and might lead to (2,8) or (3,6) which are apples.\n\nLooking at the board layout more carefully: My tail is at (2,2), so moving DOWN to (3,3) might not trap me yet, but UP or RIGHT seem better for apples.\n\nActually, (3,6) is an apple - that's just two steps up from (3,4). (4,5) is an apple - that's one step right then one step up. Both are good targets.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider enemy movement. The enemy is at (6,7) with 7 apples. They might be moving toward apples at (7,8), (8,8), (8,6), (9,6), etc. I should avoid the top-right cluster where they are likely heading.\n\nThe apple at (4,5) seems safer and closer to my current position. Let me check if there are any immediate threats:\n\nFrom (3,4), moving UP to (3,5): safe, no apple.\nFrom (3,4), moving RIGHT to (4,4): safe, no apple.\n\nBut which gives better future options? (4,4) can go to (4,5) [apple], (5,4), (3,4) [back], (4,3). (3,5) can go to (3,6) [apple], (2,5), (4,5) [apple], (3,4) [back].\n\nBoth seem good, but RIGHT might be slightly better because:\n1. It moves me away from my tail at (2,2) and body segments on the left\n2. It positions me to grab the apple at (4,5) next turn\n3. It keeps me more central in the board\n\nActually, let me reconsider UP. (3,5) is empty, and from there I could go to (3,6) which IS an apple. That's a direct path to an apple.\n\nBut looking at the board state again: Row 5 shows \"A . . . A . . . T . .\" meaning (0,5) is A, (4,5) is A, and (8,5) is T (enemy body?). So (4,5) is an apple.\n\nRow 6 shows \". A . A . T T T A A\" meaning (1,6) is A, (3,6) is A, and (6,6) is T, (7,6) is T, etc.\n\nSo both (3,6) and (4,5) are apples.\n\nGiven that I'm at (3,4), moving UP to (3,5) puts me directly below (3,6) apple. Moving RIGHT to (4,4) puts me left of (4,5) apple.\n\nI think UP might be slightly better because:\n- (3,6) is an apple I can reach next turn\n- The path seems clearer upward\n- I can potentially go to (2,8) later which is also an apple\n\nBut let me check for enemy head-on collision risk. The enemy is at (6,7). If they move LEFT or DOWN, they could potentially reach areas I'm considering, but they're quite far away. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nI'll choose UP to position myself for the apple at (3,6) and maintain upward mobility toward (2,8).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nCurrent state at turn 17: My head at (3,5) after moving UP last turn. My body is now: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] (the tail has moved, removing (3,5) from the head position). Enemy snake #1 is at (7,7) with 7 apples.\n\nKey observations:\n- Apples at (3,6) and (4,5) are very close and safe to pursue.\n- My tail is now at (2,2), so my body is mostly in the left-center area.\n- Enemy is in top-right and might be targeting apples at (7,8), (8,8), (8,6), etc.\n- I need to secure apples to reach 30, but also avoid the enemy's zone to prevent head-on collisions.\n- Long-term: After eating (3,6), move toward (2,8) or (4,5), then potentially explore the left side for (0,5) and (1,6) apples.\n- Strategy: Stay out of top-right corner where enemy is, use the center-left area, and plan routes that avoid dead ends.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nCurrent turn 17. My head is at (3,5) after moving UP last turn. Enemy head at (7,7). Apples at: (3,6) is directly above me, (4,5) is to my right-up diagonal.\n\nEvaluating moves from (3,5):\n- **UP to (3,6)**: This is an apple! I will grow and score 8 points. Must check safety: (3,6) is within board. Is it occupied? My body: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] - (3,6) not in body. Enemy body: [(6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)] - (3,6) not in enemy. So safe. This is the best move - immediate apple gain, and opens up future moves to (2,8), (3,7), (4,6) etc.\n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: This is where my tail was, but now my body has moved, so (3,4) is my second segment (the new tail after moving up?). Wait, my body list shows (3,4) as first body segment after head. Actually, if I moved UP from (3,4) to (3,5), my body becomes: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (2,4), etc. So (3,4) is part of my body. Moving DOWN to (3,4) would be moving into my own body (the segment right behind my head) - that's a death move. Invalid.\n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: Check: (2,5) within board. Not in my body (body is at (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)). Not in enemy body. No apple. Safe but not optimal since we have an apple directly above.\n- **RIGHT to (4,5)**: Check: (4,5) within board. Not in my body. Not in enemy body. (4,5) IS an apple! So this also gives an apple. But wait, looking at board state: Row 5 shows \"A . . . A . . . T . .\" meaning (0,5) is A, (4,5) is A. Yes, (4,5) is an apple. So both UP and RIGHT give apples.\n\nNow choose between UP (to (3,6) apple) and RIGHT (to (4,5) apple). Both are safe and give points. Consider future options:\n- From (3,6) after eating apple: Can go UP to (3,7), DOWN to (3,5), LEFT to (2,6), RIGHT to (4,6). (2,6) might lead to (2,8) apple. (3,7) is empty. (4,6) is empty? Board row 6: \". A . A . T T T A A\" so (4,6) is empty (between (3,6) apple and (5,6) T). So good options.\n- From (4,5) after eating apple: Can go UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), RIGHT to (5,5). (4,6) is empty. (3,5) is my current position (would be moving back into my own body after I move? Wait, if I move RIGHT to (4,5), my body would shift: head at (4,5), body: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]? Actually, need to simulate: Before move, head (3,5), body [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]. If I move RIGHT to (4,5) (apple), my new head is (4,5), and my body becomes: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] - the tail (2,2) remains unless I eat. So from (4,5), moving LEFT would go to (3,5) which is now part of my body - that would be death. So LEFT is not safe from (4,5). From (4,5), other moves: UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), RIGHT to (5,5). Those are safe.\n\nCompare:\n- UP to (3,6): Gets apple at (3,6). From there, moves: UP(3,7), DOWN(3,5), LEFT(2,6), RIGHT(4,6) - all potentially safe, and LEFT(2,6) might lead to (2,8) apple later.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Gets apple at (4,5). From there, moves: UP(4,6), DOWN(4,4), RIGHT(5,5) - LEFT is unsafe. So fewer options, and (4,4) is empty but might not lead to more apples quickly.\n\nApple proximity: (3,6) is one step up; (4,5) is one step right. Both are immediate.\n\nStrategic position: (3,6) is closer to (2,8) apple (two steps away: (3,6)->(2,6)->(2,7)->(2,8)? Actually (2,8) is at x=2,y=8. From (3,6) to (2,8) is two steps: left then up-up. (4,5) is farther from (2,8). Also, (3,6) is in column 3, which has another apple at (3,9) far up, but that might be too far. The left side has apples at (0,5), (1,6), (1,9). From (3,6), I can head left toward those.\n\nEnemy movement: Enemy at (7,7). They might go for apples at (7,8), (8,8), (8,6), (9,6). Avoiding top-right is good.\n\nConsidering all, UP to (3,6) gives an apple and keeps options open toward left-side apples. RIGHT to (4,5) gives an apple but moves me right, closer to enemy zone. So UP seems better for long-term strategy.\n\nAlso, note: If I go UP, I eat (3,6). If enemy goes for (4,5), they might eat it, but that's okay - I don't need to compete directly. I should focus on my own path.\n\nTherefore, choose UP.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

My body is now: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] (tail remains at (2,2) since I ate). Enemy snake #1 at (7,8) after moving UP (since last turn head was (7,7), and likely they went UP to (7,8) to eat apple there). Enemy body: [(7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)]. Apples: still many, but note (3,6) is now gone (eaten). Apples near me: (2,8) is two steps away (left-up), (4,5) is to my right-down diagonal, (0,5), (1,6), (1,9) on left side.\n\nNow from (3,6) (head), evaluate moves:\n- **UP to (3,7)**: Check board: row 7 has \" . . . . . T T T . .\" (from visual: row 7 is 7: . . . . . T T T . .). (3,7) is empty (not T, not A). Not in my body (my body occupies (3,5) and others). Not in enemy body (enemy body includes (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), etc., but not (3,7)). Safe. This moves me upward toward (3,9) apple (far) and keeps center-top path open.\n- **DOWN to (3,5)**: (3,5) is now part of my body (first segment after head). Moving down into own body would cause death. Invalid.\n- **LEFT to (2,6)**: Check board: row 6 has \". A . A . T T T A A\". (2,6) is between (1,6) and (3,6)? Actually coordinates: row 6: (0,6) empty? Visual shows row 6: \". A . A . T T T A A\" meaning x=0 empty, x=1 A (but that's (1,6) apple? Wait row 6 is y=6. So (0,6) empty, (1,6) apple? Actually the string: \". A . A . T T T A A\" corresponds to x=0 to 9: x0: empty, x1: A, x2: empty, x3: A (but we ate (3,6) so that's now empty?), x4: empty, x5: T, x6: T, x7: T, x8: A, x9: A. So (2,6) is empty. Not in my body (my body: (3,5) etc., not (2,6)). Not in enemy body (enemy at y=7,8). Safe. This leads to (2,8) apple.\n- **RIGHT to (4,6)**: Check board: (4,6) is empty (as above). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe. But this moves right, closer to enemy zone (enemy at (7,8), body nearby). Might not be optimal.\n\nNow choose between UP, LEFT, RIGHT. All safe. Consider strategy: Want to gather apples toward left side (0,5), (1,6), (1,9) and avoid top-right where enemy is. LEFT to (2,6) brings me closer to (2,8) apple (two steps away: (2,6)->(2,7)->(2,8)). From (2,6), I can also go UP to (2,7) (empty), LEFT to (1,6) (apple), etc. RIGHT to (4,6) is neutral but less strategic. UP to (3,7) is upward but away from left-side apples.\n\nEnemy is at (7,8) and likely will go for (8,8) or (9,6) apples, so they are in top-right. I should avoid that area and secure my own apples. LEFT seems best for long-term apple collection and path flexibility. Also, (1,6) is an apple, and from (2,6) I can go LEFT directly to eat it next turn if still there. Also (0,5) is nearby via (2,6)->(1,6)->(0,6)->(0,5) or other routes.\n\nSo I will go LEFT to (2,6).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

UP to (2,7) also safe but doesn't gain apple now. DOWN to (2,5) also safe but maybe less strategic. RIGHT to (3,6) is neutral but closer to enemy zone. So choose LEFT to eat apple at (1,6).

          "rationale": "**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nFrom current head (1,6) after eating apple, I have grown. My body now includes (1,6) and (2,6) etc. I need to avoid moving back into (2,6) next turn. Apples nearby: (0,5) is left/down, (1,9) is up, (0,8) is left/up. I should head towards (0,5) or (1,9) depending on safety. Enemy snake #1 is near top-right, likely going for apples there. I should avoid their area. Consider moving UP from (1,6) to (1,7) (currently empty per board: row7 \". . . . . T T T . .\"? Wait board row7 shows: \". . . . . T T T . .\" and row6 shows \". 0 T T . T T T A A\". Actually row7 column1 is '.'? Let's verify board: Row 9: \"9 . A . A . . 1 T . .\" Row 8: \"8 A . A . . A . T A .\" Row 7: \"7 . . . . . T T T . .\" Row 6: \"6 . 0 T T .

A . . . . . . .\" Row 0: \"0 . . . . . . . . . A\". So at (1,7) is '.' empty. (1,8) is '.'? Row8 col1 is 'A'? Row8: \"8 A . A . . A . T A .\" so col1 (x=1) is '.'? Actually indexes: x=0: 'A', x=1: '.', x=2: 'A', x=3: '.', x=4: 'A', x=5: '.', x=6: 'A', x=7: '.', x=8: 'T', x=9: 'A'. So (1,8) is empty. (1,9) is 'A' apple. So moving UP twice gets to apple. But need to consider enemy head (6,9) maybe moving left? Could be dangerous if they head towards me. However, distance is large. Also (0,5) apple is closer but there is a body at (0,4) and (0,3) etc. (0,5) is empty? Row5 col0 is 'A' apple. So (0,5) is apple. But path: from (1,6) I can go LEFT to (0,6) which is empty? Row6 col0 is '.'? Row6: \"6 . 0 T T . T T T A A\" so col0 is '.' empty. Then DOWN to (0,5) apple. But moving DOWN from (1,6) goes to (1,5) which is empty? Row5 col1 is '.' empty. So many options. I'll decide after immediate safety check.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nFrom (1,6), check moves:\n- UP to (1,7): empty (row7 col1 '.'). Safe.\n- DOWN to (1,5): empty (row5 col1 '.'). Safe.\n- LEFT to (0,6): empty (row6 col0 '.'). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,6): but (2,6) is my own body (first segment after head? Actually my body list: [(2,6), (3,6), ...] so (2,6) is my body. Moving right into my own body would kill me. Also moving backwards? The head is at (1,6), previous body segment is (2,6) which is to the right. Moving right would be moving into that segment, which is forbidden. So RIGHT is fatal.\n\nThus safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow consider enemy: head at (6,9). Could move LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8) or RIGHT (off board) or UP (off board). Likely they will go for apples: (5,8) apple is at (5,8), (4,5) etc. They might go DOWN to (6,8) which is empty? Row8 col6 is 'A' apple? Row8: \"8 A . A . . A . T A .\" col6 is 'A'? Actually col6 is x=6, which is 'A'? Let's index: x=0 A, x=1 ., x=2 A, x=3 ., x=4 A, x=5 ., x=6 A, x=7 ., x=8 T, x=9 A. So (6,8) is apple. That could be a target. Also (5,8) is apple at (5,8) which is also an apple? Row8 col5 is '.'? Actually x=5 is '.'? Wait row8: \"8 A . A . . A . T A .\" So positions: x=0 'A', x=1 '.', x=2 'A', x=3 '.', x=4 'A', x=5 '.', x=6 'A', x=7 '.', x=8 'T', x=9 'A'. So (5,8) is '.' empty, (6,8) is 'A' apple. So enemy might go DOWN to (6,8) to eat apple. If they do, they grow. That could affect later. Also they might go LEFT to (5,9) but (5,9) is empty? Row9: \"9 . A . A . . 1 T . .\" x=5 is '.'? Actually x=5 is '.'? Row9: x=0 '.', x=1 'A', x=2 '.', x=3 'A', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 '.', x=7 '1', x=8 'T', x=9 '.'. So (5,9) is '.' empty. So both possible.\n\nNow for my move, I need to consider future options and avoid traps. If I go UP to (1,7), next turn I can go UP to (1,8) or LEFT to (0,7) or DOWN back to (1,6) (but that's now my body? After moving, my head will be at (1,7), body will include (1,6) and then the rest. So moving back DOWN would be into my own body (the cell I just came from) which would kill me. So I must avoid moving back into immediate previous body segment. So from (1,7), the only safe directions are those not occupied by my own body. At (1,7), the cell behind (1,6) is occupied by my body, so moving DOWN is fatal. Left (0,7) is empty, UP (1,8) empty, RIGHT (2,7) empty? Row7 col2 is '.'? Row7: \"7 . . . . . T T T . .\" so (2,7) is '.' empty. So multiple options.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,5), then next turn I could go DOWN to (1,4) but (1,4) is my body? Let's see my body list: (1,4) is in my body? Actually body includes (1,4) from list: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3)]. So (1,4) is indeed my body. So moving DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4) would kill me. So I must avoid that. Other options from (1,5): UP back to (1,6) (which will be body after move? After moving to (1,5), my head will be at (1,5), body will include (1,6) and the rest. So moving UP back to (1,6) would be moving into my own body, fatal. LEFT to (0,5) is apple, but check if (0,5) is empty? It's an apple, but also is there any body there? My body doesn't include (0,5). So safe to move into apple. RIGHT to (2,5) is empty? Row5 col2 is '.'? Row5: \"5 A . . T A . . T . .\" so (2,5) is '.' empty. So from (1,5) I have LEFT (apple) and RIGHT (empty) and maybe DOWN? Down to (1,4) is body, so not safe. So limited options.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,6), then next turn I could go UP to (0,7) empty, DOWN to (0,5) apple, LEFT off board (die), RIGHT to (1,6) which will be body? After moving to (0,6), my body includes (1,6) as the segment behind. So moving RIGHT back to (1,6) would be fatal. So only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nNow which move gives me more options and safety? LEFT to (0,6) gives me access to apple at (0,5) directly below, and also (0,7) up. That seems good. Also I am moving away from enemy and toward left side apples. However, note that there is a body segment at (0,4) and (0,3) etc. So going down to (0,5) is an apple but then from there I could go RIGHT to (1,5) or DOWN to (0,4) but (0,4) is my body? Actually (0,4) is in my body list. So after eating apple at (0,5), my head at (0,5), body includes (0,6) and then (1,6)... So moving DOWN from (0,5) to (0,4) would be moving into my own body (the segment (0,4) is part of my body). That's fatal. So after eating (0,5), I must avoid moving into (0,4). So I would need to move RIGHT or maybe UP if possible. But (0,5) apple is good, but it might lead to a trap later. However, I can still go RIGHT to (1,5) which is empty and not my body? (1,5) is empty and not in my body (my body includes (1,4), (1,3), etc but not (1,5)). So after eating (0,5), I could go RIGHT to (1,5). That seems fine.\n\nAlternatively, going UP to (1,7) gives me more space and access to (1,9) apple later. Also (2,8) apple is nearby. But enemy might be heading that way? Enemy is at (6,9), could go left and down, but not immediately threatening. However, if I go up, I might be getting closer to enemy territory? Actually distance: from (1,7) to enemy head (6,9) is 5 steps away, not immediate.\n\nBut also note there is an apple at (1,6) which I already ate. So now I have grown. My current length is 10 (head + 9 body segments). I need to survive and collect more apples.\n\nLet's think about long-term survival: I should avoid getting trapped by my own body. Currently my body forms a shape that might limit my movement. My body is: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3). This forms a sort of loop? Actually it's like a snake winding. I have a potential trap around the left side. If I go LEFT to (0,6), I am moving into a region with my body below (0,5) and (0,4) etc. But that's okay for now.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving DOWN to (1,5) to go to apple (0,5) next turn? But from (1,5), I can go LEFT to (0,5) apple. That seems like a direct path to an apple. However, from (1,5), moving LEFT is safe and eats apple. But after eating, I will be at (0,5) with body extending to (1,5) and (1,6) etc. That might be okay.\n\nBut from (1,6), moving DOWN to (1,5) is safe and gives me the option to go LEFT to (0,5) next turn. That seems good because I get two moves to eat an apple? Actually from (1,6) to (1,5) is one move, then next turn from (1,5) to (0,5) eats apple. So in two turns I eat an apple. Alternatively, if I go LEFT directly to (0,6) and then DOWN to (0,5), that's also two moves to eat the same apple. But from (0,6) I can also go DOWN to (0,5) directly, which is one move? Actually from (0,6) to (0,5) is one move DOWN, and (0,5) is an apple. So if I go LEFT now to (0,6), then next turn I can go DOWN to (0,5) and eat the apple. That's also two moves total. So both paths take two moves to eat (0,5). However, from (0,6) I have only one apple reachable in the next move, while from (1,5) I also have apple (0,5) reachable, but also I could go RIGHT to (2,5) and maybe other apples later? Not sure.\n\nBut there is also apple at (2,8) which is up from (1,6) via (1,7) and (1,8) then (2,8). That's three moves away. Apple at (1,9) is up from (1,6) via (1,7) and (1,8) then (1,9) (three moves). Apple at (0,8) is left and up from (1,6) via (1,7)->(1,8)->(0,8) or (0,6)->(0,7)->(0,8). So many options.\n\nNow, also consider enemy. Snake #1 has 9 apples, same as me. We are tied. The game is only at turn 20, plenty of time. I need to outlast and outgrow them. They are in the top-right, potentially heading towards apples there. I should avoid competing directly and focus on left side apples. But note there are many apples: (9,2), (0,5), (1,9), (9,0), (2,8), (6,3), (3,9), (9,6), (4,5), (8,8), (8,6), (2,1), (5,8), (5,2), (0,8). Actually I already ate (1,6) which is an apple? Wait (1,6) is not in the list? The apples list includes (9,2), (0,5), (1,9), (9,0), (2,8), (6,3), (3,9), (9,6), (4,5), (8,8), (8,6), (2,1), (5,8), (5,2), (0,8). There is no (1,6). But the board shows at (1,6) my head is there, but the board notation might be outdated? Actually the apples are listed separately. The board shows the current state with '0' for my head, '1' for enemy head, 'T' for snake body, 'A' for apple, '.' for empty. So at (1,6) the board shows '0' because that's my head. But earlier there was an apple at (1,6)? Wait, in the previous turn rationale, it said LEFT to (1,6) (apple). But looking at the apples list, (1,6) is not there. Perhaps there was an apple at (1,6) that got eaten by me? But the apples list provided is the current apples on the board. Let's check: In the initial board state, at (1,6) there is '0' (my head). But earlier in the last move rationale, they said \"LEFT to (1,6) (apple)\". That might be a mistake? Let's examine the board from turn 20: The board is given after my move? Actually the turn is 20, and they show the board state. It shows row6: \"6 . 0 T T . T T T A A\". So at (1,6) is '0'. That means I moved LEFT from (2,6) to (1,6) and ate an apple? But there is no apple at (1,6) in the list. However, maybe the apple list is only for apples currently on the board, and the apple at (1,6) was eaten, so it's removed. That makes sense: I moved into an apple, so it's gone, and I grew. So now there is no apple at (1,6). So the apples list is the remaining apples. Good.\n\nSo remaining apples: (0,5), (1,9), (9,0), (2,8), (6,3), (3,9), (9,6), (4,5), (8,8), (8,6), (2,1), (5,8), (5,2), (0,8), (9,2). That's 15 apples. I have 9 apples, enemy has 9.\n\nNow, from (1,6), which move gives me the best chance to get an apple soon while staying safe? Let's evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. UP to (1,7): safe, empty. Then from there I can go UP to (1,8) (empty), LEFT to (0,7) (empty), RIGHT to (2,7) (empty). Also maybe DOWN back is fatal. This opens up to apple (1,9) in two moves (via (1,8)), and also apple (0,8) via (0,7) then (0,8). Also apple (2,8) via (2,7) then (2,8). So multiple options. However, note that apple (1,9) is at (1,9), which is currently empty? Row9 col1 is 'A' according to board? Row9: \"9 . A . A . . 1 T . .\" so (1,9) is 'A' apple. Yes, there is an apple at (1,9). So moving UP gives me access to that apple. Also enemy head at (6,9) might move towards (5,9) or (6,8). If they move left to (5,9), they are getting closer to the left side? But still far. However, if I go up, I might be heading towards the top row, which could be risky if enemy comes down. But they are at (6,9), so they are on the top row already. They could move down to (6,8) or left to (5,9). If they move left, they could approach (4,9) etc. Not immediate threat.\n\n2. DOWN to (1,5): safe, empty. From there, I can go LEFT to (0,5) (apple), RIGHT to (2,5) (empty), UP back to (1,6) (fatal after move). So limited to left and right. If I go LEFT to (0,5) and eat apple, then from (0,5) I can go UP to (0,6) (but (0,6) will be my body? After moving to (0,5), my body includes (1,6), (2,6)... and also (1,5)? Wait careful: If I move DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5), my head becomes (1,5). The old head (1,6) becomes part of my body. So my body will be: (1,5) head, then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3). So (0,6) is not in my body; it's empty. So from (0,5) after eating apple, I can go UP to (0,6) which is safe? (0,6) is empty and not my body. But is (0,6) reachable? Yes. Also from (0,5) I could go RIGHT to (1,5) but (1,5) is my body? Actually (1,5) is the segment I just left? After moving to (0,5), my body includes (1,5) as the segment behind the head? Wait the body order: head (0,5), then (1,5), then (1,6), etc. So (1,5) is part of my body. So moving RIGHT back to (1,5) would be fatal. So from (0,5), I can go UP, LEFT (off board), DOWN (to (0,4) which is my body? (0,4) is in my body list, so fatal), or RIGHT (to (1,5) body). So only UP is safe. That would lead to (0,6). Then from (0,6), I can go UP to (0,7) or LEFT off board or RIGHT to (1,6) (body) or DOWN back to (0,5) (body). So (0,7) is safe. Then from (0,7) I can go UP to (0,8) (apple) or RIGHT to (1,7) etc. So after eating (0,5), I am forced to go UP, which leads to (0,6) then (0,7) then (0,8) apple. That's a path. However, note that (0,8) is an apple, but also (1,9) is an apple. So I could eventually go right to (1,8) etc. But from (0,7), I could go RIGHT to (1,7) which is empty. So not trapped.\n\n3. LEFT to (0,6): safe, empty. From there, I can go UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5) (apple), LEFT off board (die), RIGHT to (1,6) (body after move). So safe moves: UP, DOWN. That gives me access to apple (0,5) directly below in one move, and also (0,8) via up. Also from (0,6) I can go DOWN to (0,5) and eat apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow comparing these three options, which is best? I need to consider that the enemy might be moving towards me. The enemy is at (6,9). They are far, but if they start moving left and down, they could eventually reach the left side. However, there are many turns left. I should focus on immediate safety and apple collection.\n\nOption UP to (1,7) gives me more mobility and access to multiple apples (1,9, 2,8, 0,8). However, moving up might bring me closer to the top row where the enemy is. But the enemy is at (6,9), so they are on the top row. If they move left, they could be at (5,9), (4,9), etc. So moving to (1,9) might be safe for a while. Also, note that there is an enemy body at (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5). So they have a long body extending leftwards. They might be moving towards the left side themselves? Their head at (6,9) could go down to (6,8) (apple), then left to (5,8) (apple), etc. They might be heading towards the cluster of apples at (5,8), (8,8), (4,5), etc. So they might not come to my side immediately.\n\nOption DOWN to (1,5) leads to apple (0,5) but then I am forced to go UP. That might be okay, but it limits my options after eating the apple. However, I can still go UP to (0,6) then (0,7) then (0,8) or (1,8). That might be slower.\n\nOption LEFT to (0,6) gives me immediate access to (0,5) apple in one move, and also (0,8) via up. But after eating (0,5), I am forced to go UP as well. So similar to the DOWN path but starting from (0,6) instead of (1,5). Actually from (0,6) I can go DOWN to (0,5) and eat apple. Then from (0,5) I must go UP to (0,6) (body) wait no, after eating, my head at (0,5), body includes (0,6) as the segment behind. So moving UP to (0,6) would be into my own body (fatal). So from (0,5) I cannot go UP because (0,6) is now part of my body. I must go RIGHT or LEFT or DOWN. But LEFT off board, DOWN to (0,4) body, RIGHT to (1,5) empty? Wait (1,5) is empty and not my body? After moving to (0,5), my body includes (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), ... and also (1,5) is not in the body because I didn't move through (1,5). So (1,5) is empty. So from (0,5), I can go RIGHT to (1,5). That's safe. So actually I am not forced to go UP; I can go RIGHT. That gives me more flexibility. So LEFT to (0,6) then DOWN to (0,5) is good, then from (0,5) I can go RIGHT to (1,5) and continue.\n\nThus LEFT move seems promising because it gets me closer to the left side and opens up the left edge.\n\nNow, also consider that there is an apple at (2,1) and (2,8) etc. But I need to plan long-term.\n\nGiven the board size is only 10x10, and there are two snakes, I should try to control the left side while enemy controls the right side. The apple distribution: many apples on left: (0,5), (0,8), (1,9), (2,8), (2,1), (4,5) is central? (4,5) is left of center. Also (6,3) is center, (5,8) right, (8,8) right, (8,6) right, (9,2) right, (9,0) right, (5,2) center-right. So left side has (0,5), (0,8), (1,9), (2,8), (2,1). That's five apples. Right side has many more. So I might want to secure the left side first, then maybe venture into center if safe.\n\nBut note that my current body is on the left side already, blocking some paths. I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nNow, evaluating safety: From (1,6), moving LEFT to (0,6) is safe. However, check if (0,6) is adjacent to any enemy body? The enemy body is at (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5). So not near.\n\nAlso, check for potential head-on collision: If enemy moves into (0,6) at the same time? That's highly unlikely because they are far away. They would need to move multiple steps. So safe.\n\nThus, LEFT is safe and gives good options.\n\nNow, what about UP? UP to (1,7) is also safe. But I need to consider if enemy might move into (1,7) simultaneously? No, they are at (6,9), so impossible in one move.\n\nDOWN to (1,5) is safe, but (1,5) is empty and not in my body.\n\nAll three are safe. Which one maximizes future options? Let's count the number of safe moves from each potential head position after one move:\n\n- After UP to (1,7): From (1,7), safe moves: UP (1,8) empty, LEFT (0,7) empty, RIGHT (2,7) empty. That's 3 safe moves (excluding DOWN into body). So degree 3.\n- After DOWN to (1,5): From (1,5), safe moves: LEFT (0,5) apple, RIGHT (2,5) empty. UP is into body (1,6), DOWN into body (1,4). So degree 2.\n- After LEFT to (0,6): From (0,6), safe moves: UP (0,7) empty, DOWN (0,5) apple. LEFT off board, RIGHT into body (1,6). So degree 2.\n\nThus, UP gives me more maneuverability. However, I must also consider that moving UP might bring me closer to the top row, which could be dangerous if enemy heads left. But from (1,7), I am still far from enemy. Also, from (1,7) I can go to (1,8) and then (1,9) apple, which is a direct target. That seems efficient.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (2,8) which is near. From (1,7), I could go RIGHT to (2,7) then UP to (2,8) apple. That's two moves. Or UP to (1,8) then RIGHT to (2,8). Same.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,6), I can get apple (0,5) in one move, but then I might be forced to go RIGHT or UP, and I am somewhat confined to the left edge. But that might be okay.\n\nI also need to consider the enemy's potential move. If I go UP, I am moving away from the enemy, which is good. If I go LEFT, I am also moving away. If I go DOWN, I am moving slightly towards the center but still left.\n\nAnother factor: the board has a \"T\" for snake bodies. My own body is present. I must avoid getting trapped. Looking at the board, there are many T's on the right side (enemy body). My body is on the left. The board shows my body as T's on rows 4-6 etc. For example, row4: \"4 T T T T . . . . . .\" That's my body at (0,4) to (3,4) maybe. Row3: \"3 T T . . . . A . . .\" that's my body at (0,3) and (1,3). So my body occupies a rectangle-like shape on the left. This could become a trap if I move into it. I need to avoid moving into those cells.\n\nFrom my current head at (1,6), moving UP, DOWN, LEFT are all outside my body. Moving RIGHT is into my body.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,9). If I go UP, I can reach it in two moves. If I go LEFT, I could eventually go UP to (0,7) then (0,8) then (1,8) then (1,9), which takes more moves. So UP seems more direct for that apple.\n\nAlso, apple (2,8) is also reachable via UP. So UP might be better for immediate apple acquisition.\n\nWhat about apple (0,5)? If I go LEFT, I can get it in one move (from (0,6) to (0,5)). If I go UP, I can still eventually get to (0,5) via (0,6) and (0,5), but that would take more moves. However, I might prioritize apples that are closer and safer.\n\nGiven that I have 9 apples already, and the game is at turn 20, I have time. I should aim to collect apples while maintaining safety and future options. Moving UP seems to give me more freedom and access to multiple apples. It also keeps me away from my own body, reducing risk of self-collision later.\n\nNow, I must also consider the possibility of the enemy moving into my path. If I go UP, and the enemy moves leftwards, they might eventually threaten me. But that's many turns later.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (1,9) which is adjacent to the top edge. If I go there, I might be trapped if enemy comes from the right. But the enemy's body is currently on the right side, so they might not come quickly.\n\nLet's simulate a possible sequence: If I go UP to (1,7), then next turn I could go UP to (1,8) (safe), then UP to (1,9) and eat apple. That would be two turns. During those turns, the enemy might move, but they have to cover distance from (6,9) to (1,9). That's 5 steps left, impossible in two moves. So I can safely eat (1,9). After eating, I grow, and my head at (1,9). From there, I could go DOWN to (1,8), LEFT to (0,9) but (0,9) is empty? Row9 col0 is '.' empty. Or RIGHT to (2,9) but (2,9) is '.'? Row9 col2 is '.'? Actually row9: \"9 . A . A . . 1 T . .\" so (2,9) is '.'? col2 is '.'? yes. So I have options. However, note that (0,9) is empty, but if I go there, I might be near the left edge. Also, (1,9) is at the top, so I have to be careful not to go off board. From (1,9), I can't go UP. So I would have to go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. All are safe except maybe right into enemy if they are at (2,9) but they are far.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,6) and then DOWN to (0,5) to eat apple, I could then go RIGHT to (1,5) and then maybe UP to (1,6) but that's body, so not. I would have to go UP from (1,5) to (1,6) which is body, so not. So from (1,5) after eating (0,5), I might go RIGHT to (2,5) and then explore. That might lead to central apples like (4,5) or (2,8) via up.\n\nBut (4,5) is an apple, but it's to the right. That might bring me closer to enemy territory.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the fact that I am currently at (1,6) and my body is on the left, I think moving UP is the most flexible and safe.\n\nAlso, note that in the last move, I moved LEFT to (1,6) to eat an apple. Now I am at (1,6). If I move UP, I am continuing in a similar direction (up-left). That might be consistent.\n\nNow, check for any immediate danger: If I move UP to (1,7), is there any possibility that the enemy could move into (1,7) simultaneously? No, because they are at (6,9). Their maximum movement range is one cell. So they cannot reach (1,7) in one turn.\n\nWhat about my own body? I already checked.\n\nWhat about moving off board? UP from (1,6) goes to (1,7) which is within board.\n\nThus, UP is safe.\n\nNow, I need to decide which move to choose. I think UP is the best for maintaining options and accessing apples quickly.\n\nBut let's also consider DOWN: moving down to (1,5) might be good because it gets me closer to apple (0,5) and also apple (2,1) via down? Actually (2,1) is far down. But from (1,5), I could go RIGHT to (2,5) and then down to (2,4) but (2,4) is my body? Actually (2,4) is my body? My body includes (2,4) from the list? Yes, (2,4) is in my body. So going down from (2,5) to (2,4) would be fatal. So I need to be careful.\n\nFrom (1,5), going RIGHT to (2,5) is safe, then from (2,5) I could go UP to (2,6) but (2,6) is my body? Actually (2,6) is my body (the segment after head? At this point, after moving to (1,5), my body includes (1,6), (2,6), etc. So (2,6) is my body. So moving UP from (2,5) to (2,6) would be fatal. So from (2,5), my safe moves would be LEFT back to (1,5), DOWN to (2,4) (body), UP to (2,6) (body), RIGHT to (3,5) maybe empty? (3,5) is '.'? Row5 col3 is '.'? Row5: \"5 A . . T A . . T . .\" so (3,5) is '.' empty. So from (2,5), I could go RIGHT to (3,5). That's safe. So I could go to the right. But that brings me closer to enemy body? (3,5) is near enemy body? Enemy body has (5,6), (5,7), etc. Not immediate.\n\nStill, I think UP gives me more freedom.\n\nNow, consider the long-term plan I would write. I should document my strategy.\n\nI'll choose UP.\n\nBut wait, there's also the apple at (1,9) which is an immediate target if I go UP. However, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't also target that apple. The enemy is at (6,9) and there is an apple at (8,8) and (8,6) etc. They might not go for (1,9). So it's likely safe.\n\nThus, my move is UP.\n\nI'll write my rationale and plan.\n\nNote: The response must end with exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nSo I'll output: UP\n\nBut I need to include the long-term plan before the move. So in my response, I'll write the plan, then the move.\n\nLet's structure:\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n[plan text]\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP\n\nI'll make sure the move line is exactly \"UP\" without extra text.\n\nNow, writing the plan: I'll summarize my reasoning and future steps.\n\nFinal decision: UP.**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nFrom (1,6), moving UP to (1,7) opens up multiple safe paths to nearby apples (1,9, 2,8, 0,8) while keeping maximum maneuverability (3 safe follow-up moves). This avoids confinement to the left edge and maintains distance from my own body and the enemy. Prioritizing the top-left apples secures the left side while staying clear of enemy territory for now. Plan: From (1,7), next turn move UP to (1,8) (safe), then UP to (1,9) to eat apple. After that, assess enemy movement and consider pivoting to (0,8) or (2,8) as needed.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nUP",

However, I must also consider the enemy snake's move. Snake #1 is at (5,8) with body filling around it. From (1,9), my immediate options next turn will be LEFT to (0,9) (safe, empty), DOWN to (1,8) (safe, just vacated), or potentially RIGHT to (2,9) (safe if empty). I need to avoid moving into the enemy's body. The enemy could potentially move toward me, but given the distance and board layout, (1,9) seems reasonably secure for now.

The apples at (0,8) and (2,8) are the nearest targets. The enemy's head is at (4,9), which is relatively far from the left edge. If I move to (0,9) or (1,9), I will be much closer to the apple at (0,8) than the enemy is. However, moving to (0,9) traps me against the wall if the enemy cuts me off. Moving to (2,9) keeps me more central but leaves the apple at (0,8) vulnerable if the enemy moves left. Considering the score is tied, I need to secure points while maintaining safety. The apple at (9,2) is too far. The apple at (5,2) is a potential mid-game target. I should focus on clearing the left side first.\n\n**Current Move Calculation:**\n1.  **Current Position:** (2, 9).\n2.  **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 9). Body blocks (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6).\n3.  **My Body:** (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4).\n4.  **Available Apples:** (0, 8), (2, 8), (9, 2), etc.\n\n*   **UP (2, 10):** Off board. Death.\n*   **DOWN (2, 8):** Contains an apple.\n    *   Board check: (2, 8) is marked 'A'.\n    *   Snake check: The enemy snake occupies (4,9) and other coordinates, not (2, 8). My body is at (1, 9) and (3, 6)... wait, let's check my body carefully. The list is head-to-tail.\n        *   Head: (2, 9)\n        *   Segment 1: (1, 9)\n        *   Segment 2: (1, 8)\n        *   Segment 3: (1, 7)\n        *   ...\n        *   Segment 10: (1, 4)\n    *   My body does not currently occupy (2, 8). (1, 8) is adjacent but (2, 8) is empty of my body.\n    *   Enemy body is at (4, 8), (5, 8), etc. Not (2, 8).\n    *   Collision check: If I move DOWN, I go to (2, 8). The enemy moves simultaneously.\n        *   Enemy moves from (4, 9). Possible moves: (4, 10) off, (3, 9) empty (apple at 3,9?), (5, 9) empty? Let's check board.\n        *   Board at 9: `. T 0 A 1 . T T . .`\n        *   (3, 9): 'A' (Apple). (5, 9): '.' (Empty). (4, 8): 'T' (Tail of enemy? No, body). (4, 10): Off board.\n        *   If enemy moves to (3, 9), it eats an apple. If enemy moves to (5, 9), it is safe.\n        *   Enemy cannot reach (2, 8) in one move from (4, 9).\n    *   Conclusion: Move DOWN is safe and eats an apple. It expands my snake, giving me 11 apples.\n\n*   **LEFT (1, 9):** My body segment 1 is at (1, 9).\n    *   Since I am moving simultaneously with the enemy, my tail will move *after* I move. However, moving into the cell currently occupied by my own body counts as suicide.\n    *   The cell (1, 9) is occupied by my body. I cannot move there.\n\n*   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Contains an apple.\n    *   Board check: (3, 9) is 'A'.\n    *   Snake check: My body is at (2, 9), (1, 9)... not (3, 9). Enemy body is at (4, 8), (5, 8)... not (3, 9).\n    *   Enemy collision: The enemy head is at (4, 9). (3, 9) is adjacent to (4, 9).\n        *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 9), we have a head-on collision. Both die.\n        *   If the enemy moves UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, it does not hit (3, 9).\n    *   Risk Analysis: Moving DOWN to (2, 8) guarantees I eat an apple and grow. Moving RIGHT to (3, 9) risks a head-on collision with the enemy if the enemy decides to move LEFT.\n    *   The enemy is at (4, 9). Looking at the board, (4, 8) is occupied by its own body (tail of the segment). (4, 10) is off board. (5, 9) is empty. (3, 9) is an apple.\n    *   The enemy likely wants to eat the apple at (3, 9) or (5, 9).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (3, 9), and the enemy goes LEFT to (3, 9), we both die.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2, 8), I eat an apple and avoid the enemy's immediate proximity.\n    *   (2, 8) is safer.\n\nDecision: Moving DOWN is the safest move that also scores a point. Moving RIGHT risks death by collision. Moving LEFT is suicide into my own body. Moving UP is off board.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT is safe: it avoids head-on collision, keeps space on the top row, and advances without unsafe risk.\n\nObservation: Staying on the top row gives me room to maneuver and time to see the enemy\u2019s plan. The nearest safe apple opportunities to the right are at (8,8) and (8,6); moving toward them preserves options.\n\nPlan: After moving RIGHT to (5,9), head toward the right-side apples (8,8) and (8,6) while watching the enemy\u2019s moves and keeping an exit path open to avoid being boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (0, 8) and (3, 9) are attractive. From (5, 9), moving **LEFT** to (4, 9) is a valid move but hits its own body (since (4, 9) is its neck). Moving **UP** (5, 10) is off board. Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 9) is valid (currently empty on board, though part of its previous body, the tail will move). Moving **DOWN** to (5, 8) is valid (currently part of its body, but the tail moves). Given the apples at (3, 9) and (0, 8), a move **LEFT** or **DOWN** are likely. However, to reach the left side apples, **LEFT** is the direction, but it's blocked by its own neck. It must turn. It will likely try to maneuver towards the left via **DOWN** or wrap around via **RIGHT**. Let's assume it wants to chase the apples at (0,8) or (2,8) (which is now me). To get to (0,8), it needs to move towards (4,8) or (3,9). From (5,9), it can move DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9). (5,8) is currently occupied by its body. (6,9) is empty.\n\n3.  **Board State & Apples:**\n    *   Apples remaining include (0, 8), (2, 1), (9, 2), etc.\n    *   I am at (2, 8).

This is now my tail (after moving down from (2,9) to (2,8) last turn). However, since I just moved, my tail will move forward to (2,9) *after* I move. So (2, 9) will be occupied by my body (the segment currently at (2,9) becomes the new tail, but the cell (2,9) is currently occupied by my body). Wait, let's trace the body flow.\n        *   Current Head: (2, 8)\n        *   Current Body: (2, 9) ...\n        *   If I move UP to (2, 9): The cell (2, 9) is currently occupied by my second body segment. Since I am moving into a cell occupied by my own body (even if it's the tail, it's still occupied *at the start of the turn*), this is suicide.\n        *   **Result:** INVALID (Death).\n\n    *   **LEFT:** (1, 8).\n        *   **Board:** (1, 8) is empty ('.').\n        *   **Body:** My body is at [(2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9)...]. (1, 8) is not currently occupied by my body.\n        *   **Enemy:** The enemy is at (5, 9). Can it reach (1, 8)? No.\n        *   **Goal:** Moving LEFT towards (0, 8) apple.\n        *   **Safety:** Looks safe.\n\n    *   **RIGHT:** (3, 8).\n        *   **Board:** (3, 8) is 'T' (Enemy tail? No, looking at the enemy body list: (3,8) is not listed). Wait, looking at the provided body list for Snake #1: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7)].

Less optimal for scoring immediately.\n\n    *   **DOWN:** (2, 7).\n        *   **Board:** (2, 7) is '.' (Empty).\n        *   **Body:** Not occupied by me.\n        *   **Enemy:** Not occupied by enemy.\n        *   **Goal:** Moves towards the (2, 1) apple, but (0, 8) is closer.\n\n5.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    *   The apple at (0, 8) is the closest immediate target (2 moves away).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (1, 8) is the direct path.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** or **RIGHT** delays grabbing this apple and allows the enemy (who is nearby at (5,9)) potentially to cut me off or take it.\n    *   **Safety Check on LEFT (1, 8):** Is there any danger?\n        *   My body: (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8) is free. Wait, (1, 8) is NOT in the body list. The list is [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,7)...]. (1,8) is skipped. So it's safe.\n        *   Enemy: Enemy is at (5,9). It cannot attack (1,8) this turn.\n        *   Head-on collision: Is the enemy moving to (1, 8)? Highly unlikely. It is focused on the apples at (3,9) or (0,8) from a distance.\n\n    *   **Decision:** Move LEFT to (1, 8). This secures the path to the apple at (0, 8) for the next turn. It is safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (0, 8) next turn to reach 13 apples. Keep an eye on the enemy's position; if it pushes aggressively towards the left side, I may need to pivot to the central apples (2, 1) or bottom-right apples (9, 2) to avoid a trap. The enemy is currently on the right/top side, giving me temporary safe access to the left wall apples.\n\nLEFT",

If forced to move anyway, the least risky-looking option would be to continue the same direction I just used, hoping for a fleeting advantage or a misstep from the enemy next turn.\n\nLong-term plan note:\n- Keep the top edge as a high-mafety corridor to avoid being boxed in.\n- Watch enemy head movements closely to anticipate head-on risks and aim for safe apples on the far-right side (e.g., around (8,8) and (8,6)) when possible.\n- If the opportunity arises, try to force space openings by coordinating turns that push the enemy away from the central corridors and toward the edges.\n\nRIGHT",
