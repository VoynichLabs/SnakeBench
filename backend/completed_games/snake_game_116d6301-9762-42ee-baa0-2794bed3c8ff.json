            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area.

Last move was RIGHT, which brought me to this position.\n- Apples: (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), (1,6)\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,7) with no body segments. So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple. Monitoring enemy movement toward the x=6 apples will be crucial.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Last move was RIGHT, which brought me to this position.\n- Apples: (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), (1,6)\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,7) with no body segments. So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple. Monitoring enemy movement toward the x=6 apples will be crucial.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Distance reduces to 2 moves away.\n   - Since I'm on the same row, this is the fastest path to an apple.\n   - Enemy is at (6,6), which is 4 units away vertically from (6,2). If enemy moves straight down, it would take 4 moves to reach (6,2), while I can get there in 2 more moves (after RIGHT now). So I'll likely beat them to it.\n   - Low risk: No snakes or walls nearby. Path to (6,2) is clear.\n\n2. **UP (to 3,3)**:\n   - Moves me toward the apple at (6,4) or (1,6), but both are farther away.\n   - Distance to (6,4): |3-6| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4 moves.\n   - Distance to (1,6): |3-1| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves.\n   - This is less efficient than going for (6,2) first.\n\n3. **DOWN (to 3,1)**:\n   - Targets apple at (6,1). Distance: |3-6| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3 moves (after moving down, I'd be at (3,1), then right 3 times).\n   - But (6,2) is closer (only 2 moves away after RIGHT). Also, (6,1) might be contested if enemy moves down, but they're farther.\n\n4. **LEFT (to 2,2)**:\n   - Backtracks away from all apples except (0,9) and (1,6), which are far. \n   - (0,9) is |3-0| + |2-9| = 3 + 7 = 10 moves away\u2014too slow.\n   - (1,6) is |3-1| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\u2014still inefficient.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The apple at (6,2) is the closest and easiest to secure. Grabbing it quickly should be the priority.\n- After eating (6,2), I can immediately go DOWN to (6,1) or UP to (6,4) for more points, creating a chain.\n- Enemy at (6,6) could threaten (6,4) if they move down, but they might go elsewhere (e.g., toward (1,6) or (0,9)).\n- Risk assessment: \n  - Moving RIGHT is safe\u2014no snakes or obstacles between (3,2) and (6,2). \n  - Walls: All moves are within bounds (x=0-9, y=0-9), so no wall collision.\n- If I get the apple at (6,2), I grow by one segment. My body would then be at (3,2) when I move to (4,2), but since it's just one segment, it won't cause self-collision unless I backtrack immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move. It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2). Continue RIGHT unless the enemy moves aggressively toward (6,2). \n- If enemy starts descending (e.g., to (6,5)), I might need to hurry, but they're still 4 moves away vertically from the apple.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nTo maximize efficiency and points, move RIGHT toward the apple at (6,2). This is the shortest path to an apple and positions me to potentially chain multiple apples in the area. Enemy interference is unlikely given their distance. Proceed with RIGHT.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer. However, moving directly up to (1,6) would require 4 UP moves, but I can only move one step per turn. \n- The (6,2) apple is 5 units away (|1-6| + |2-2|=5+0=5). Enemy is farther from it (|5-6| + |7-2|=1+5=6). \n- (1,6) is tempting due to proximity, but going UP now would take me away from the denser apple cluster at x=6. \n- LEFT to (0,2) moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and enemy is closer to it.\n- DOWN to (1,1) gets me closer to (6,1) but that apple is 5 units away vs 4 to (1,6).\n\nBest immediate move is RIGHT to (2,2):\n- Puts me on a direct path toward (6,2), where I have a slight time advantage over the enemy.\n- Avoids the wall (no risk since x=2 is within bounds).\n- Not moving toward the enemy\u2019s position (5,7), which is distant.\n- After this, I can continue RIGHT to (3,2), (4,2), etc., to reach (6,2) in 4 more moves.\n\nFor next turn: Plan to go RIGHT again unless the board changes significantly.

So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

My body would then be at (3,2) when I move to (4,2), but since it's just one segment, it won't cause self-collision unless I backtrack immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move. It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2).

Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer.

The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

            "rationale": "<think> After that, I will write the response as the user expects, in the format of a Snake game strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current board state:\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (5,2) with no body segments (since body at []). That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5). That means the head is at (6,4) and it's facing down, since the body is above it at (6,5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 .

But no snake is mentioned there. Perhaps T is a typo or something else. Let me recheck the board state:\n\nActual board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .   # (1,6) is A\n 5 . . . . . T . . . .   # (5,5) is T? Not explained. Maybe it's a typo? The enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5). Perhaps T is at (5,5) but not mentioned? Or it could be a mistake in the input. I'll assume it's an error and (5,5) is empty for now, since no snake is listed there.\n 4 . . . . . . 1 . . .   # Enemy snake head at (6,4)\n 3 . . .

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Closer to apple at (6, 4), but we need to go around other apples and avoid walls.\n- Moving to (4, 6) (DOWN):\n  - Obstacle at (4, 4)? Not currently, but moving down may lead us toward the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving to (3, 7) (LEFT):\n  - No immediate obstacle, but may not be strategic unless heading toward the apples on the left side.\n- Moving to (5, 7) (RIGHT):\n  - No obstacle, but the apples are predominantly on the right side at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nPriority is to reach apples efficiently:\n\n- The apple at (6, 4) is relatively close.

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer. However, moving directly up to (1,6) would require 4 UP moves, but I can only move one step per turn. \n- The (6,2) apple is 5 units away (|1-6| + |2-2|=5+0=5). Enemy is farther from it (|5-6| + |7-2|=1+5=6). \n- (1,6) is tempting due to proximity, but going UP now would take me away from the denser apple cluster at x=6. \n- LEFT to (0,2) moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and enemy is closer to it.\n- DOWN to (1,1) gets me closer to (6,1) but that apple is 5 units away vs 4 to (1,6).\n\nBest immediate move is RIGHT to (2,2):\n- Puts me on a direct path toward (6,2), where I have a slight time advantage over the enemy.\n- Avoids the wall (no risk since x=2 is within bounds).\n- Not moving toward the enemy\u2019s position (5,7), which is distant.\n- After this, I can continue RIGHT to (3,2), (4,2), etc., to reach (6,2) in 4 more moves.\n\nFor next turn: Plan to go RIGHT again unless the board changes significantly.

This also keeps me aligned to potentially collect other apples in the x=6 cluster afterward. \n\nNext turn strategy: Continue moving RIGHT if possible to reach the apple faster, but reassess based on enemy movement and apple availability.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Last move was RIGHT, which brought me to this position.\n- Apples: (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), (1,6)\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,7) with no body segments. So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple. Monitoring enemy movement toward the x=6 apples will be crucial.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2).

That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5). That means the head is at (6,4) and it's facing down, since the body is above it at (6,5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 . A . . . . . . . .   # A at (1,6)\n5 . . . . . T . . . .   # T? Not sure what T is, but (5,5) is empty? Wait, in the board state, it says at row 5: \". . . . . T . . . .\" - so (5,5) is T? But no snake is mentioned there. Perhaps T is a typo or something else. Let me recheck the board state:\n\nActual board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .   # (1,6) is A\n 5 . . . . . T . . . .   # (5,5) is T? Not explained. Maybe it's a typo? The enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5). Perhaps T is at (5,5) but not mentioned? Or it could be a mistake in the input. I'll assume it's an error and (5,5) is empty for now, since no snake is listed there.\n 4 . . . . . . 1 . . .   # Enemy snake head at (6,4)\n 3 . . .

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Wait, hold on\u2014the apple at (6,2) appears to be at (6,2) as well, but the enemy snake is at (6,2). So that position is actually occupied by the enemy snake; hence, I can't go into (6,2).\n\nThis is crucial:\n- Since the enemy snake is occupying (6,2), I cannot move into it.\n- Therefore, I need an alternative route to reach other apples or find a safe path.\n\nLooking at other apples:\n- (8,8): far away, less desirable for now.\n- (0,9): at top-left; may not be accessible directly now.\n- (1,6): nearby, but perhaps more complex to reach.\n- (3,3): in the middle, but less accessible now.\n- (6,1): just below (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the enemy.\n\nSince (6,2) is occupied by the enemy, I should avoid moving into it.\n\nMoving downward from (6,4) to (6,3):\n- Is (6,3) occupied or dangerous?\n- (6,3) appears to be free, given current info.\n\nNext, from (6,3):\n- The cell below is (6,2), occupied by the enemy snake.\n- Moving down again from (6,3) would bring me into (6,2)\u2014not possible.\n\nTherefore, instead of moving down, maybe consider moving left or right.\n\nOptions:\n- Moving left: (5,4)\n- Moving right: (7,4)\n\nChecking their surroundings:\n- (5,4): safe if unoccupied.\n- (7,4): safe as well.\n\nAre there apples nearby that can be reached by moving left or right? From our current position:\n- Moving left to (5,4): seems safe.\n- Moving right to (7,4): also seems safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- Moving left to (5,4):\n  - Looks like it leads to (5,6) which has an apple at (1,6), not helpful.\n- Moving right to (7,4):\n  - Doesn't immediately lead to an apple either.\n\nPerhaps moving towards the apple at (1,6):\n- To reach (1,6), I could maneuver around.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ostensible goal of the immediate apple at (6,2):\n- Since (6,2) is occupied by the enemy snake, I can't go there.\n\nGiven these observations, perhaps the best move is to move **left** from (6,4) to (5,4), as that provides options for future moves and avoids the obstacle at (6,2).\n\nConclusion:\n- Move left (to (5,4)) to explore safer avenues and avoid the enemy snake occupying (6,2).\n\nNext move: LEFT.",

So my full snake is: [(6,2) head, (5,2) body].\n- Apples at: (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3), (8,8) \u2014 note that (6,1) is directly below me.\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at head (6,3) with body [(6,4)]. So its full snake: head at (6,3), body at (6,4). This means the enemy is above me on the same x=6 column.\n\nBoard visualization (y=9 top to y=0 bottom):\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9: A . . . . . . . . .   (apple at (0,9))\n8: . . . . . . . .

Wait, the board state shows at y=2: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" meaning only my head at (6,2), but body at (5,2) is at y=2, x=5, which should be shown in the same row? In the board:\n\nThe board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . .

But that's my body? **\n\nClarifying: The board state says for row 2: \". . . . . T 0 . . .\" \u2014 so at (5,2) it's marked as 'T', but that's my body. Similarly, at row 4: \". . . . . . T . . .\" at (6,4) is the enemy body? But enemy body is at (6,4), so it should be part of snake 1. This seems like a rendering artifact. I think 'T' might represent a snake body segment. In the description, it says \"T\" in positions that are snake bodies. So for row 2: (5,2) is my body, marked 'T', and (6,2) is my head '0'. For row 4: (6,4) is enemy body 'T'? But in row 3, (6,3) is enemy head marked '1'. In row 4, it says (6,4) is 'T', which is consistent with the enemy body. Similarly, in row 2, (5,2) is 'T' for my body. So I'll interpret:\n- '0': my head\n- '1': enemy head\n- 'T': any snake body segment (could be mine or enemy's)\n- 'A': apple\n\nSo corrected board:\n 9: (0,9)='A', others empty\n 8: (8,8)='A'\n 7: all empty\n 6: (1,6)='A'\n 5: all empty? But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now. Current state has row 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 empty.\n 4: (6,4)='T' (enemy body)\n 3: (3,3)='A', (6,3)='1' (enemy head)\n 2: (5,2)='T' (my body), (6,2)='0' (my head)\n 1: (6,1)='A'\n 0: all empty\n\nSo my snake: head (6,2), body (5,2)\nEnemy snake: head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from my position (6,2):\n- UP: to (6,3) \u2014 but that's where the enemy head is! That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8). Avoid self-collision with my growing body.",

Closer to apple at (6, 4), but we need to go around other apples and avoid walls.\n- Moving to (4, 6) (DOWN):\n  - Obstacle at (4, 4)? Not currently, but moving down may lead us toward the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving to (3, 7) (LEFT):\n  - No immediate obstacle, but may not be strategic unless heading toward the apples on the left side.\n- Moving to (5, 7) (RIGHT):\n  - No obstacle, but the apples are predominantly on the right side at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nPriority is to reach apples efficiently:\n\n- The apple at (6, 4) is relatively close.

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky.

So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2).

If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Wait, hold on\u2014the apple at (6,2) appears to be at (6,2) as well, but the enemy snake is at (6,2). So that position is actually occupied by the enemy snake; hence, I can't go into (6,2).\n\nThis is crucial:\n- Since the enemy snake is occupying (6,2), I cannot move into it.\n- Therefore, I need an alternative route to reach other apples or find a safe path.\n\nLooking at other apples:\n- (8,8): far away, less desirable for now.\n- (0,9): at top-left; may not be accessible directly now.\n- (1,6): nearby, but perhaps more complex to reach.\n- (3,3): in the middle, but less accessible now.\n- (6,1): just below (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the enemy.\n\nSince (6,2) is occupied by the enemy, I should avoid moving into it.\n\nMoving downward from (6,4) to (6,3):\n- Is (6,3) occupied or dangerous?\n- (6,3) appears to be free, given current info.\n\nNext, from (6,3):\n- The cell below is (6,2), occupied by the enemy snake.\n- Moving down again from (6,3) would bring me into (6,2)\u2014not possible.\n\nTherefore, instead of moving down, maybe consider moving left or right.\n\nOptions:\n- Moving left: (5,4)\n- Moving right: (7,4)\n\nChecking their surroundings:\n- (5,4): safe if unoccupied.\n- (7,4): safe as well.\n\nAre there apples nearby that can be reached by moving left or right? From our current position:\n- Moving left to (5,4): seems safe.\n- Moving right to (7,4): also seems safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- Moving left to (5,4):\n  - Looks like it leads to (5,6) which has an apple at (1,6), not helpful.\n- Moving right to (7,4):\n  - Doesn't immediately lead to an apple either.\n\nPerhaps moving towards the apple at (1,6):\n- To reach (1,6), I could maneuver around.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ostensible goal of the immediate apple at (6,2):\n- Since (6,2) is occupied by the enemy snake, I can't go there.\n\nGiven these observations, perhaps the best move is to move **left** from (6,4) to (5,4), as that provides options for future moves and avoids the obstacle at (6,2).\n\nConclusion:\n- Move left (to (5,4)) to explore safer avenues and avoid the enemy snake occupying (6,2).\n\nNext move: LEFT.",

Wait, the board state shows at y=2: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" meaning only my head at (6,2), but body at (5,2) is at y=2, x=5, which should be shown in the same row? In the board:\n\nThe board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . .

But that's my body? **\n\nClarifying: The board state says for row 2: \". . . . . T 0 . . .\" \u2014 so at (5,2) it's marked as 'T', but that's my body. Similarly, at row 4: \". . . . . . T . . .\" at (6,4) is the enemy body? But enemy body is at (6,4), so it should be part of snake 1. This seems like a rendering artifact. I think 'T' might represent a snake body segment. In the description, it says \"T\" in positions that are snake bodies. So for row 2: (5,2) is my body, marked 'T', and (6,2) is my head '0'. For row 4: (6,4) is enemy body 'T'? But in row 3, (6,3) is enemy head marked '1'. In row 4, it says (6,4) is 'T', which is consistent with the enemy body. Similarly, in row 2, (5,2) is 'T' for my body. So I'll interpret:\n- '0': my head\n- '1': enemy head\n- 'T': any snake body segment (could be mine or enemy's)\n- 'A': apple\n\nSo corrected board:\n 9: (0,9)='A', others empty\n 8: (8,8)='A'\n 7: all empty\n 6: (1,6)='A'\n 5: all empty? But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now. Current state has row 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 empty.\n 4: (6,4)='T' (enemy body)\n 3: (3,3)='A', (6,3)='1' (enemy head)\n 2: (5,2)='T' (my body), (6,2)='0' (my head)\n 1: (6,1)='A'\n 0: all empty\n\nSo my snake: head (6,2), body (5,2)\nEnemy snake: head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from my position (6,2):\n- UP: to (6,3) \u2014 but that's where the enemy head is! That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8).

(6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer.

The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

            "rationale": "<think> After that, I will write the response as the user expects, in the format of a Snake game strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current board state:\n- My snake (ID 0) is at (5,2) with no body segments (since body at []). That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5). That means the head is at (6,4) and it's facing down, since the body is above it at (6,5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 .

But no snake is mentioned there. Perhaps T is a typo or something else. Let me recheck the board state:\n\nActual board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .   # (1,6) is A\n 5 . . . . .

I'll assume it's an error and (5,5) is empty for now, since no snake is listed there.\n 4 . . . . . . 1 . . .   # Enemy snake head at (6,4)\n 3 . . .

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Wait, hold on\u2014the apple at (6,2) appears to be at (6,2) as well, but the enemy snake is at (6,2). So that position is actually occupied by the enemy snake; hence, I can't go into (6,2).\n\nThis is crucial:\n- Since the enemy snake is occupying (6,2), I cannot move into it.\n- Therefore, I need an alternative route to reach other apples or find a safe path.\n\nLooking at other apples:\n- (8,8): far away, less desirable for now.\n- (0,9): at top-left; may not be accessible directly now.\n- (1,6): nearby, but perhaps more complex to reach.\n- (3,3): in the middle, but less accessible now.\n- (6,1): just below (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the enemy.\n\nSince (6,2) is occupied by the enemy, I should avoid moving into it.\n\nMoving downward from (6,4) to (6,3):\n- Is (6,3) occupied or dangerous?\n- (6,3) appears to be free, given current info.\n\nNext, from (6,3):\n- The cell below is (6,2), occupied by the enemy snake.\n- Moving down again from (6,3) would bring me into (6,2)\u2014not possible.\n\nTherefore, instead of moving down, maybe consider moving left or right.\n\nOptions:\n- Moving left: (5,4)\n- Moving right: (7,4)\n\nChecking their surroundings:\n- (5,4): safe if unoccupied.\n- (7,4): safe as well.\n\nAre there apples nearby that can be reached by moving left or right?

But that's my body? **\n\nClarifying: The board state says for row 2: \". . . . . T 0 . . .\" \u2014 so at (5,2) it's marked as 'T', but that's my body. Similarly, at row 4: \". . . . . . T . . .\" at (6,4) is the enemy body? But enemy body is at (6,4), so it should be part of snake 1. This seems like a rendering artifact. I think 'T' might represent a snake body segment. In the description, it says \"T\" in positions that are snake bodies. So for row 2: (5,2) is my body, marked 'T', and (6,2) is my head '0'. For row 4: (6,4) is enemy body 'T'? But in row 3, (6,3) is enemy head marked '1'. In row 4, it says (6,4) is 'T', which is consistent with the enemy body. Similarly, in row 2, (5,2) is 'T' for my body. So I'll interpret:\n- '0': my head\n- '1': enemy head\n- 'T': any snake body segment (could be mine or enemy's)\n- 'A': apple\n\nSo corrected board:\n 9: (0,9)='A', others empty\n 8: (8,8)='A'\n 7: all empty\n 6: (1,6)='A'\n 5: all empty? But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now.

That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8).

The head is the front of the snake.\n- Apples are at: (0,9), (1,6), (3,3), (8,8), (7,0) \u2014 but note that (7,0) is an apple, and I'm at (6,0), so that apple is adjacent to my head to the right.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at head position (5,2) with body at [(5,3)]. So its head is at (5,2), and one body segment at (5,3).\n\nBoard state visualization:\n  Y coordinates from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom)\n  X coordinates from 0 (left) to 9 (right)\n\nFrom the board:\n  Row 9: A at (0,9), rest empty\n  Row 8: A at (8,8)\n  Row 6: A at (1,6)\n  Row 3: A at (3,3)\n  Row 0: A at (7,0) \u2014 this is the apple I see near me.\n\nAlso:\n  My snake: head at (6,0), body at (6,1) and (6,2). So on the board, at:\n    (6,0): head (marked as 0)\n    (6,1): body (T for tail? but it says \"T\" in the board, but in the list it's part of my body)\n    (6,2): body (T again)\n\n  Enemy snake: head at (5,2) (marked as 1), body at (5,3) (marked as T)\n\nThe board shows:\n  At (0,9): A\n  At (8,8): A\n  At (1,6): A\n  At (3,3): A\n  At (7,0): A  \u2014 this is important because it's right next to me.\n\nAlso, the board has:\n  (6,0): 0 (my head)\n  (6,1): T (my body)\n  (6,2): T (my body) \u2014 actually, since I have two body segments, (6,1) and (6,2) are both my body.\n  (5,2): 1 (enemy head)\n  (5,3): T (enemy body)\n\nNow, my head is at (6,0). I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's see the possible moves from (6,0):\n\n- UP: to (6,1). But (6,1) is currently occupied by my own body. If I move there, I collide with myself and die. So UP is not possible. It would be suicide.\n\n- DOWN: to (6,-1). But y=-1 is outside the board (since y ranges from 0 to 9). Moving DOWN would hit the wall, and I die. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (5,0). What is at (5,0)? From the board, it's not listed as an apple or a snake. So it should be empty. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (7,0). At (7,0) there is an apple. So I can move there and eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, possible safe moves are LEFT to (5,0) and RIGHT to (7,0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate:\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0):\n  - I eat the apple at (7,0), so I gain a point and grow. After moving, my head is at (7,0), and my body will extend: the new body will include the old head and body. So the new snake will be: head at (7,0), body segments at (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Since I ate an apple, I grow, so the tail doesn't move yet. Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays in place and you add a segment. But at the moment of movement, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. After eating, the snake increases in length.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0):\n  - This is empty, so I just move without eating. My head moves to (5,0), body moves to (6,0) and (6,1), and the tail (6,2) is removed? But since I didn't eat, I don't grow, so the tail moves forward. So new snake: head at (5,0), body at (6,0), and (6,1). The segment at (6,2) is gone.\n\nNow, considering the enemy: The enemy is at (5,2) with body at (5,3). From (5,2), it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP to (5,3): but (5,3) is its own body, so suicide. Not likely.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): but (6,2) is my body segment. If it moves there, it collides with my body and dies. So it might avoid that.\n\nBut I don't control the enemy, so I have to assume it might do anything. However, I should choose a move that minimizes risk and maximizes gain.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) to eat the apple is immediately beneficial. I get a point and grow. Also, it positions me to go up or left next turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) doesn't give me anything, and I might be closer to the enemy, but at (5,0) I'm below the enemy head at (5,2). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then it could be adjacent to me, but not necessarily colliding this turn.\n\nMoreover, after moving RIGHT to (7,0), I can consider going UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) but (6,0) will be my body, so I can only go UP or perhaps RIGHT to (8,0) if possible, but (8,0) might be out of bounds? x=8, y=0 is within 0-9.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there's an apple at (1,6), (3,3), (0,9), (8,8). After eating at (7,0), I can plan to go towards (8,8) or (3,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) might allow me to go up to (5,1) and then towards (3,3) or (1,6), but without the immediate benefit of eating.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is better.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be a threat. If I move LEFT to (5,0), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then next turn it could move DOWN again to (5,0) if I'm still there, causing a head-on collision if I don't move. But since I would move, it might not happen. Still, it's riskier than moving RIGHT to eat safely.\n\nSo RIGHT is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy next turn: From (7,0), move UP to (7,1) to start heading towards the center or other apples. But I'll reassess based on the board.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the current board state, I see that moving UP or DOWN would lead to death (UP into my own body at (6,1) or DOWN off the board). Moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe but offers no immediate reward. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) allows me to consume the apple, gaining a point and growing. This is the optimal move as it secures a point and positions me near the board's edge for potential upward movement next turn. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (7,0), prioritize moving UP to (7,1) to target apples like (8,8) or (3,3), while monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Closer to apple at (6, 4), but we need to go around other apples and avoid walls.\n- Moving to (4, 6) (DOWN):\n  - Obstacle at (4, 4)? Not currently, but moving down may lead us toward the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving to (3, 7) (LEFT):\n  - No immediate obstacle, but may not be strategic unless heading toward the apples on the left side.\n- Moving to (5, 7) (RIGHT):\n  - No obstacle, but the apples are predominantly on the right side at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nPriority is to reach apples efficiently:\n\n- The apple at (6, 4) is relatively close.

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Enemy is farther from it (|5-6| + |7-2|=1+5=6). \n- (1,6) is tempting due to proximity, but going UP now would take me away from the denser apple cluster at x=6. \n- LEFT to (0,2) moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and enemy is closer to it.\n- DOWN to (1,1) gets me closer to (6,1) but that apple is 5 units away vs 4 to (1,6).\n\nBest immediate move is RIGHT to (2,2):\n- Puts me on a direct path toward (6,2), where I have a slight time advantage over the enemy.\n- Avoids the wall (no risk since x=2 is within bounds).\n- Not moving toward the enemy\u2019s position (5,7), which is distant.\n- After this, I can continue RIGHT to (3,2), (4,2), etc., to reach (6,2) in 4 more moves.\n\nFor next turn: Plan to go RIGHT again unless the board changes significantly. If the enemy moves toward (6,2), I might need to adjust, but for now, prioritize efficiency.\n\nThe <uncensored_think> tag is only for my internal thought process and should not be included in the final response. The user won't see it, so I'll think freely.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to continue my path toward the apple at (6,2), as it's the most efficient way to gain a point while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy. This also keeps me aligned to potentially collect other apples in the x=6 cluster afterward. \n\nNext turn strategy: Continue moving RIGHT if possible to reach the apple faster, but reassess based on enemy movement and apple availability.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Last move was RIGHT, which brought me to this position.\n- Apples: (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), (1,6)\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,7) with no body segments. So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

My body would then be at (3,2) when I move to (4,2), but since it's just one segment, it won't cause self-collision unless I backtrack immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move. It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2).

That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5). That means the head is at (6,4) and it's facing down, since the body is above it at (6,5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 .

But no snake is mentioned there. Perhaps T is a typo or something else. Let me recheck the board state:\n\nActual board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .   # (1,6) is A\n 5 . . . . . T . . . .   # (5,5) is T? Not explained. Maybe it's a typo? The enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5). Perhaps T is at (5,5) but not mentioned? Or it could be a mistake in the input. I'll assume it's an error and (5,5) is empty for now, since no snake is listed there.\n 4 . . . . . . 1 . . .   # Enemy snake head at (6,4)\n 3 . . .

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Wait, hold on\u2014the apple at (6,2) appears to be at (6,2) as well, but the enemy snake is at (6,2). So that position is actually occupied by the enemy snake; hence, I can't go into (6,2).\n\nThis is crucial:\n- Since the enemy snake is occupying (6,2), I cannot move into it.\n- Therefore, I need an alternative route to reach other apples or find a safe path.\n\nLooking at other apples:\n- (8,8): far away, less desirable for now.\n- (0,9): at top-left; may not be accessible directly now.\n- (1,6): nearby, but perhaps more complex to reach.\n- (3,3): in the middle, but less accessible now.\n- (6,1): just below (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the enemy.\n\nSince (6,2) is occupied by the enemy, I should avoid moving into it.\n\nMoving downward from (6,4) to (6,3):\n- Is (6,3) occupied or dangerous?\n- (6,3) appears to be free, given current info.\n\nNext, from (6,3):\n- The cell below is (6,2), occupied by the enemy snake.\n- Moving down again from (6,3) would bring me into (6,2)\u2014not possible.\n\nTherefore, instead of moving down, maybe consider moving left or right.\n\nOptions:\n- Moving left: (5,4)\n- Moving right: (7,4)\n\nChecking their surroundings:\n- (5,4): safe if unoccupied.\n- (7,4): safe as well.\n\nAre there apples nearby that can be reached by moving left or right? From our current position:\n- Moving left to (5,4): seems safe.\n- Moving right to (7,4): also seems safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- Moving left to (5,4):\n  - Looks like it leads to (5,6) which has an apple at (1,6), not helpful.\n- Moving right to (7,4):\n  - Doesn't immediately lead to an apple either.\n\nPerhaps moving towards the apple at (1,6):\n- To reach (1,6), I could maneuver around.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ostensible goal of the immediate apple at (6,2):\n- Since (6,2) is occupied by the enemy snake, I can't go there.\n\nGiven these observations, perhaps the best move is to move **left** from (6,4) to (5,4), as that provides options for future moves and avoids the obstacle at (6,2).\n\nConclusion:\n- Move left (to (5,4)) to explore safer avenues and avoid the enemy snake occupying (6,2).\n\nNext move: LEFT.",

So my full snake is: [(6,2) head, (5,2) body].\n- Apples at: (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3), (8,8) \u2014 note that (6,1) is directly below me.\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at head (6,3) with body [(6,4)]. So its full snake: head at (6,3), body at (6,4). This means the enemy is above me on the same x=6 column.\n\nBoard visualization (y=9 top to y=0 bottom):\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9: A . . . . . . . . .   (apple at (0,9))\n8: . . . . . . . .

Wait, the board state shows at y=2: \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" meaning only my head at (6,2), but body at (5,2) is at y=2, x=5, which should be shown in the same row? In the board:\n\nThe board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . A .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . .

But that's my body? **\n\nClarifying: The board state says for row 2: \". . . . . T 0 . . .\" \u2014 so at (5,2) it's marked as 'T', but that's my body. Similarly, at row 4: \". . . . . . T . . .\" at (6,4) is the enemy body? But enemy body is at (6,4), so it should be part of snake 1. This seems like a rendering artifact. I think 'T' might represent a snake body segment. In the description, it says \"T\" in positions that are snake bodies. So for row 2: (5,2) is my body, marked 'T', and (6,2) is my head '0'. For row 4: (6,4) is enemy body 'T'? But in row 3, (6,3) is enemy head marked '1'. In row 4, it says (6,4) is 'T', which is consistent with the enemy body. Similarly, in row 2, (5,2) is 'T' for my body. So I'll interpret:\n- '0': my head\n- '1': enemy head\n- 'T': any snake body segment (could be mine or enemy's)\n- 'A': apple\n\nSo corrected board:\n 9: (0,9)='A', others empty\n 8: (8,8)='A'\n 7: all empty\n 6: (1,6)='A'\n 5: all empty? But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now. Current state has row 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 empty.\n 4: (6,4)='T' (enemy body)\n 3: (3,3)='A', (6,3)='1' (enemy head)\n 2: (5,2)='T' (my body), (6,2)='0' (my head)\n 1: (6,1)='A'\n 0: all empty\n\nSo my snake: head (6,2), body (5,2)\nEnemy snake: head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from my position (6,2):\n- UP: to (6,3) \u2014 but that's where the enemy head is! That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8). Avoid self-collision with my growing body.",

So on the board, at:\n    (6,0): head (marked as 0)\n    (6,1): body (T for tail? but it says \"T\" in the board, but in the list it's part of my body)\n    (6,2): body (T again)\n\n  Enemy snake: head at (5,2) (marked as 1), body at (5,3) (marked as T)\n\nThe board shows:\n  At (0,9): A\n  At (8,8): A\n  At (1,6): A\n  At (3,3): A\n  At (7,0): A  \u2014 this is important because it's right next to me.\n\nAlso, the board has:\n  (6,0): 0 (my head)\n  (6,1): T (my body)\n  (6,2): T (my body) \u2014 actually, since I have two body segments, (6,1) and (6,2) are both my body.\n  (5,2): 1 (enemy head)\n  (5,3): T (enemy body)\n\nNow, my head is at (6,0). I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's see the possible moves from (6,0):\n\n- UP: to (6,1). But (6,1) is currently occupied by my own body. If I move there, I collide with myself and die. So UP is not possible. It would be suicide.\n\n- DOWN: to (6,-1). But y=-1 is outside the board (since y ranges from 0 to 9). Moving DOWN would hit the wall, and I die. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (5,0). What is at (5,0)? From the board, it's not listed as an apple or a snake. So it should be empty. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (7,0). At (7,0) there is an apple. So I can move there and eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, possible safe moves are LEFT to (5,0) and RIGHT to (7,0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate:\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0):\n  - I eat the apple at (7,0), so I gain a point and grow. After moving, my head is at (7,0), and my body will extend: the new body will include the old head and body. So the new snake will be: head at (7,0), body segments at (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Since I ate an apple, I grow, so the tail doesn't move yet. Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays in place and you add a segment. But at the moment of movement, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. After eating, the snake increases in length.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0):\n  - This is empty, so I just move without eating. My head moves to (5,0), body moves to (6,0) and (6,1), and the tail (6,2) is removed? But since I didn't eat, I don't grow, so the tail moves forward. So new snake: head at (5,0), body at (6,0), and (6,1). The segment at (6,2) is gone.\n\nNow, considering the enemy: The enemy is at (5,2) with body at (5,3). From (5,2), it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP to (5,3): but (5,3) is its own body, so suicide. Not likely.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): but (6,2) is my body segment. If it moves there, it collides with my body and dies. So it might avoid that.\n\nBut I don't control the enemy, so I have to assume it might do anything. However, I should choose a move that minimizes risk and maximizes gain.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) to eat the apple is immediately beneficial. I get a point and grow. Also, it positions me to go up or left next turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) doesn't give me anything, and I might be closer to the enemy, but at (5,0) I'm below the enemy head at (5,2). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then it could be adjacent to me, but not necessarily colliding this turn.\n\nMoreover, after moving RIGHT to (7,0), I can consider going UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) but (6,0) will be my body, so I can only go UP or perhaps RIGHT to (8,0) if possible, but (8,0) might be out of bounds? x=8, y=0 is within 0-9.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there's an apple at (1,6), (3,3), (0,9), (8,8). After eating at (7,0), I can plan to go towards (8,8) or (3,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) might allow me to go up to (5,1) and then towards (3,3) or (1,6), but without the immediate benefit of eating.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is better.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be a threat. If I move LEFT to (5,0), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then next turn it could move DOWN again to (5,0) if I'm still there, causing a head-on collision if I don't move. But since I would move, it might not happen. Still, it's riskier than moving RIGHT to eat safely.\n\nSo RIGHT is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy next turn: From (7,0), move UP to (7,1) to start heading towards the center or other apples. But I'll reassess based on the board.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the current board state, I see that moving UP or DOWN would lead to death (UP into my own body at (6,1) or DOWN off the board). Moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe but offers no immediate reward. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) allows me to consume the apple, gaining a point and growing. This is the optimal move as it secures a point and positions me near the board's edge for potential upward movement next turn. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (7,0), prioritize moving UP to (7,1) to target apples like (8,8) or (3,3), while monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

The apple at (7,0) is adjacent to my head to the right.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at head position (5,2) with body segment at (5,3).\n\nPossible moves from my head (6,0):\n\n- UP: (6,1) - Occupied by my body segment. Moving here would cause a collision with myself. Invalid.\n- DOWN: (6,-1) - This is outside the board (y-coordinate < 0). Moving off the board is invalid and fatal.\n- LEFT: (5,0) - Currently unoccupied. Safe to move.\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - Occupied by an apple. Moving here would eat the apple and grow my snake.\n\nEvaluating options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): Safe but doesn't provide any immediate benefit. I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow or gain points. It also moves me closer to the enemy snake at (5,2), which could be risky if the enemy moves downward.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. This is clearly the best move for immediate gain. After moving, my head will be at (7,0), and my body will extend to include the old head position, so my new body will be segments at (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2). I grow by one segment.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- The enemy snake at (5,2) could move downward to (5,1) or (5,0), but even if it moves to (5,1) this turn, it won't threaten me until next turn. By then, I'll have moved away from (7,0). Eating the apple now gives me an advantage.\n\nFuture planning:\n- After moving to (7,0), my next moves could include UP to (7,1) to start heading toward other apples like (8,8) or (3,3). I'll need to avoid the board edges and enemy snakes.\n\nConclusion:\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) is the optimal move because it:\n1. Avoids collisions (unlike UP or DOWN)\n2. Gains a point by eating the apple\n3. Grows my snake, giving me more presence on the board\n4. Positions me better for future moves toward other apples\n\nTherefore, I will move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

Closer to apple at (6, 4), but we need to go around other apples and avoid walls.\n- Moving to (4, 6) (DOWN):\n  - Obstacle at (4, 4)? Not currently, but moving down may lead us toward the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving to (3, 7) (LEFT):\n  - No immediate obstacle, but may not be strategic unless heading toward the apples on the left side.\n- Moving to (5, 7) (RIGHT):\n  - No obstacle, but the apples are predominantly on the right side at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nPriority is to reach apples efficiently:\n\n- The apple at (6, 4) is relatively close. The path would be moving right (towards x=6), and then down to y=4.\n- The apple at (6, 2) is further down.\n\nNext, I notice that trying to go directly toward (6, 4) from current position (4, 7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT: (5, 7), then (6, 7), then down to (6, 4). But I need to ensure the path is clear. \n- Moving DOWN from (4, 7) to (4, 6): no obstacle appears, but that would miss the apple at (6, 4).\n\nBecause the apples are mostly on the right, and the left side is clear, perhaps moving RIGHT is the best initial move to approach the right-side apples.\n\nAlso, I should avoid moving into positions where enemy snakes are located:\n\n- Enemy at (0, 2): far away.\n- Enemy at (0, 2): no direct threat ahead.\n\nThe next step is moving RIGHT to (5, 7).

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer.

The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple. Monitoring enemy movement toward the x=6 apples will be crucial.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Distance reduces to 2 moves away.\n   - Since I'm on the same row, this is the fastest path to an apple.\n   - Enemy is at (6,6), which is 4 units away vertically from (6,2). If enemy moves straight down, it would take 4 moves to reach (6,2), while I can get there in 2 more moves (after RIGHT now). So I'll likely beat them to it.\n   - Low risk: No snakes or walls nearby. Path to (6,2) is clear.\n\n2. **UP (to 3,3)**:\n   - Moves me toward the apple at (6,4) or (1,6), but both are farther away.\n   - Distance to (6,4): |3-6| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4 moves.\n   - Distance to (1,6): |3-1| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves.\n   - This is less efficient than going for (6,2) first.\n\n3. **DOWN (to 3,1)**:\n   - Targets apple at (6,1). Distance: |3-6| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3 moves (after moving down, I'd be at (3,1), then right 3 times).\n   - But (6,2) is closer (only 2 moves away after RIGHT). Also, (6,1) might be contested if enemy moves down, but they're farther.\n\n4. **LEFT (to 2,2)**:\n   - Backtracks away from all apples except (0,9) and (1,6), which are far. \n   - (0,9) is |3-0| + |2-9| = 3 + 7 = 10 moves away\u2014too slow.\n   - (1,6) is |3-1| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\u2014still inefficient.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The apple at (6,2) is the closest and easiest to secure. Grabbing it quickly should be the priority.\n- After eating (6,2), I can immediately go DOWN to (6,1) or UP to (6,4) for more points, creating a chain.\n- Enemy at (6,6) could threaten (6,4) if they move down, but they might go elsewhere (e.g., toward (1,6) or (0,9)).\n- Risk assessment: \n  - Moving RIGHT is safe\u2014no snakes or obstacles between (3,2) and (6,2). \n  - Walls: All moves are within bounds (x=0-9, y=0-9), so no wall collision.\n- If I get the apple at (6,2), I grow by one segment. My body would then be at (3,2) when I move to (4,2), but since it's just one segment, it won't cause self-collision unless I backtrack immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move. It minimizes distance to the nearest apple, sets up for potential multi-apple collection, and has no immediate threats. \n\n**Note for next turn:**\n- After moving to (4,2), I'll be 2 moves from (6,2). Continue RIGHT unless the enemy moves aggressively toward (6,2). \n- If enemy starts descending (e.g., to (6,5)), I might need to hurry, but they're still 4 moves away vertically from the apple.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nTo maximize efficiency and points, move RIGHT toward the apple at (6,2).

That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5). That means the head is at (6,4) and it's facing down, since the body is above it at (6,5).\n\nBoard visualization:\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n9 A . . . . . . . . .   # A at (0,9)\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . . . . . . . . . .\n6 .

I'll assume it's an error and (5,5) is empty for now, since no snake is listed there.\n 4 . . . . . . 1 . . .   # Enemy snake head at (6,4)\n 3 . . .

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now. Current state has row 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 empty.\n 4: (6,4)='T' (enemy body)\n 3: (3,3)='A', (6,3)='1' (enemy head)\n 2: (5,2)='T' (my body), (6,2)='0' (my head)\n 1: (6,1)='A'\n 0: all empty\n\nSo my snake: head (6,2), body (5,2)\nEnemy snake: head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from my position (6,2):\n- UP: to (6,3) \u2014 but that's where the enemy head is! That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8). Avoid self-collision with my growing body.",

The head is the front of the snake.\n- Apples are at: (0,9), (1,6), (3,3), (8,8), (7,0) \u2014 but note that (7,0) is an apple, and I'm at (6,0), so that apple is adjacent to my head to the right.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at head position (5,2) with body at [(5,3)]. So its head is at (5,2), and one body segment at (5,3).\n\nBoard state visualization:\n  Y coordinates from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom)\n  X coordinates from 0 (left) to 9 (right)\n\nFrom the board:\n  Row 9: A at (0,9), rest empty\n  Row 8: A at (8,8)\n  Row 6: A at (1,6)\n  Row 3: A at (3,3)\n  Row 0: A at (7,0) \u2014 this is the apple I see near me.\n\nAlso:\n  My snake: head at (6,0), body at (6,1) and (6,2). So on the board, at:\n    (6,0): head (marked as 0)\n    (6,1): body (T for tail? but it says \"T\" in the board, but in the list it's part of my body)\n    (6,2): body (T again)\n\n  Enemy snake: head at (5,2) (marked as 1), body at (5,3) (marked as T)\n\nThe board shows:\n  At (0,9): A\n  At (8,8): A\n  At (1,6): A\n  At (3,3): A\n  At (7,0): A  \u2014 this is important because it's right next to me.\n\nAlso, the board has:\n  (6,0): 0 (my head)\n  (6,1): T (my body)\n  (6,2): T (my body) \u2014 actually, since I have two body segments, (6,1) and (6,2) are both my body.\n  (5,2): 1 (enemy head)\n  (5,3): T (enemy body)\n\nNow, my head is at (6,0). I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's see the possible moves from (6,0):\n\n- UP: to (6,1). But (6,1) is currently occupied by my own body. If I move there, I collide with myself and die. So UP is not possible. It would be suicide.\n\n- DOWN: to (6,-1). But y=-1 is outside the board (since y ranges from 0 to 9). Moving DOWN would hit the wall, and I die. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (5,0). What is at (5,0)? From the board, it's not listed as an apple or a snake. So it should be empty. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (7,0). At (7,0) there is an apple. So I can move there and eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, possible safe moves are LEFT to (5,0) and RIGHT to (7,0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate:\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0):\n  - I eat the apple at (7,0), so I gain a point and grow. After moving, my head is at (7,0), and my body will extend: the new body will include the old head and body. So the new snake will be: head at (7,0), body segments at (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Since I ate an apple, I grow, so the tail doesn't move yet. Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays in place and you add a segment. But at the moment of movement, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. After eating, the snake increases in length.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0):\n  - This is empty, so I just move without eating. My head moves to (5,0), body moves to (6,0) and (6,1), and the tail (6,2) is removed? But since I didn't eat, I don't grow, so the tail moves forward. So new snake: head at (5,0), body at (6,0), and (6,1). The segment at (6,2) is gone.\n\nNow, considering the enemy: The enemy is at (5,2) with body at (5,3). From (5,2), it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP to (5,3): but (5,3) is its own body, so suicide. Not likely.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): but (6,2) is my body segment. If it moves there, it collides with my body and dies. So it might avoid that.\n\nBut I don't control the enemy, so I have to assume it might do anything. However, I should choose a move that minimizes risk and maximizes gain.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) to eat the apple is immediately beneficial. I get a point and grow. Also, it positions me to go up or left next turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) doesn't give me anything, and I might be closer to the enemy, but at (5,0) I'm below the enemy head at (5,2). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then it could be adjacent to me, but not necessarily colliding this turn.\n\nMoreover, after moving RIGHT to (7,0), I can consider going UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) but (6,0) will be my body, so I can only go UP or perhaps RIGHT to (8,0) if possible, but (8,0) might be out of bounds? x=8, y=0 is within 0-9.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there's an apple at (1,6), (3,3), (0,9), (8,8). After eating at (7,0), I can plan to go towards (8,8) or (3,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) might allow me to go up to (5,1) and then towards (3,3) or (1,6), but without the immediate benefit of eating.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is better.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be a threat. If I move LEFT to (5,0), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then next turn it could move DOWN again to (5,0) if I'm still there, causing a head-on collision if I don't move. But since I would move, it might not happen. Still, it's riskier than moving RIGHT to eat safely.\n\nSo RIGHT is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy next turn: From (7,0), move UP to (7,1) to start heading towards the center or other apples. But I'll reassess based on the board.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the current board state, I see that moving UP or DOWN would lead to death (UP into my own body at (6,1) or DOWN off the board). Moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe but offers no immediate reward. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) allows me to consume the apple, gaining a point and growing. This is the optimal move as it secures a point and positions me near the board's edge for potential upward movement next turn. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (7,0), prioritize moving UP to (7,1) to target apples like (8,8) or (3,3), while monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

That should be at y=1, x=5.\n\nIn the board for y=1: \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 positions: x=0 to 9: so x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T'? Or is it \" . . . . . T T . . .\" meaning from the start: first character is x=0, which is '.', then x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', etc.\n\nBut enemy snake #1 has a body segment at (5,1), so at (x=5,y=1) should be part of enemy body. So the board shows it as 'T'? Similarly, my body at (6,1) is also at (x=6,y=1), which is also shown as 'T'.\n\nSo in the board, 'T' probably means a body segment of any snake. Head is shown as the snake ID: '0' for me, '1' for enemy.\n\nNow, my current head position: (8,0). Body: (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). So at (8,0): head, (7,0): body, (6,0): body, and (6,1): body.\n\nPossible moves from (8,0):\n\n- UP: (8,1) \u2014 what's there? From the board, at y=1, x=8: in the string \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 for y=1, it's \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 so x=8 is '.'? Let's count: positions for y=1: x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'? The string is \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 spaces? The board is shown with leading y-coordinate, then 10 characters.\n\nIn the board state:\n\" 9 A . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 that's 10 dots/letters after \"9 \"\nSimilarly, \" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" \u2014 10 characters: . . . . . . . A A . \u2192 10 positions.\n\nFor y=1: \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 after \"1 \" there are 10 characters: first is '.', then '.', '.', '.', '.', 'T', 'T', '.', '.', '.' \u2014 so positions:\nx=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'\n\nSimilarly, y=0: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 that's after \"0 \" : 10 characters: . . . . . 1 T T 0 . ? But it has spaces? No, it should be without spaces. The text says: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 but that includes spaces? Actually, I think the board is printed with spaces between for readability, but the positions are without spaces. Let me parse:\n\nIt says: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 and it's for x from 0 to 9. So the characters are: first character is '.' (x=0), then space? No, I think the board representation has spaces between the characters for readability, but we should ignore spaces. For example:\n\n\" 9 A . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 means at y=9: A, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., ., . for x=0 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, \" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" \u2014 at y=8: ., ., ., ., ., ., ., A, A, . for x=0 to 9.\n\nFor y=0: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 if we remove spaces, it would be: characters are [., ., ., ., ., 1, T, T, 0, .] for x=0 to 9? But it has \"0 \" at the beginning, which is the y-coordinate, then the 10 cells.\n\nSo for y=0: cells are: x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: '1', x=6: 'T', x=7: 'T', x=8: '0', x=9: '.'? But at x=8, it's '0', which is my head, and x=7: 'T' (my body at (7,0)), x=6: 'T' (my body at (6,0)), and x=5: '1' (enemy head at (5,0)).\n\nNow, back to possible moves from my head (8,0):\n\n- UP: to (8,1) \u2014 from board, at (8,1): in y=1 row, x=8 is '.' (empty), so safe to move.\n- DOWN: to (8,-1) \u2014 invalid, off the board (y=-1 doesn't exist).\n- LEFT: to (7,0) \u2014 at (7,0) is currently my body segment? From the board, at y=0, x=7 is 'T', which is a body segment. Specifically, it's part of my own body: my body segments are at (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). So (7,0) is occupied by my body. Moving left to (7,0) would cause a collision with myself. Invalid.\n- RIGHT: to (9,0) \u2014 at y=0, x=9 is '.' (from the board: last character for y=0 is '.' at x=9). So (9,0) is empty. But x=9 is within 0-9? (9,0) is the bottom-right corner, which is valid.\n\nCoordinates: from (0,0) to (9,9). So x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9. (9,0) is on the board.\n\nSo possible moves: UP to (8,1) or RIGHT to (9,0). DOWN is off board, LEFT is into my own body.\n\nApples: there is an apple at (7,8) and (8,8), but they are far away. Also at (0,9), (1,6), (3,3). None are adjacent to me.\n\nMy current position: (8,0). Moving to (9,0) is the right edge, which might be risky in future moves, but for now, it's empty and safe. Moving up to (8,1) is also safe.\n\nWhat about enemy snake? Enemy snake #1 is at (5,0) head, with body at (5,1). So it's not directly threatening me right now. It's at x=5,y=0, I'm at x=8,y=0, so three cells away.\n\nI need to choose between UP and RIGHT.\n\nStrategy: I should head towards apples to grow. The nearest apples might be (8,8) or (7,8), but they are at the top. (0,9) is top-left, (1,6) is left, (3,3) is center-left.\n\nFrom (8,0), moving UP to (8,1) starts going up the right column towards (8,8). Moving RIGHT to (9,0) puts me on the corner, which limits options next turn: from (9,0), I can only go UP (to (9,1)) or LEFT (back to (8,0), but (8,0) will be empty after I move, but it might be risky if enemy comes, but not immediately).\n\nAlso, after moving, my tail will move. My body is: head at (8,0), then (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). When I move, the tail (6,1) will move to (6,0) or something? In snake games, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment, and the tail segment is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince I'm not eating an apple this move (no apple at (8,1) or (9,0)), my snake will not grow, so the tail will be removed. So after move:\n\n- If I move UP to (8,1): new head at (8,1), body becomes: (8,0), (7,0), (6,0). The segment at (6,1) is removed? No: the body segments shift: the segment that was at head position (8,0) becomes the new first body segment, then (7,0) becomes second, then (6,0) becomes third, and the tail (6,1) is removed because no growth. So new body: [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0)].\n\nSimilarly, if I move RIGHT to (9,0): new head at (9,0), body: (8,0), (7,0), (6,0).\n\nNow, considering future paths:\n\nMoving UP to (8,1): from there, I can go LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), or RIGHT to (9,1). (7,1) is empty, (9,1) is empty? From board, y=1, x=7 is '.', x=9 is '.'.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,0): then I can go UP to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,0). (8,0) will be empty after I move, since it's now a body segment but when I move it becomes part of body, but for next move, when I move from (9,0), (8,0) is occupied by my body? Yes, but I can go back to (8,0) only if I have to, but it's generally not good to go backwards into body unless necessary.\n\nBut in this case, after moving to (9,0), the body is at (8,0), (7,0), (6,0). So if I go LEFT to (8,0), that's where my body is, which would be a collision. So from (9,0), I cannot go LEFT back to (8,0) because it's occupied. Only UP to (9,1) is possible? And (9,1) from board is '.'.\n\nSo moving to (9,0) leaves me only one direction: UP to (9,1) next turn, which is okay but limits options.\n\nWhereas moving UP to (8,1) gives me more options: next turn, I can go LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), or RIGHT to (9,1). All of which might be safe.\n\nAlso, to reach the apples at (8,8) or (7,8), going up is better. (8,8) is directly above at (8,8), same x, so moving up multiple times.\n\nBut there are no immediate apples, so I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, enemy snake at (5,0) might be moving. It could move up to (5,1), but (5,1) is its own body? Enemy body is at (5,1), so it cannot move there. It could move LEFT to (4,0), DOWN is off board? (5,-1) invalid, RIGHT to (6,0) \u2014 but (6,0) is my body? Currently, (6,0) is my body segment. So if enemy moves RIGHT to (6,0), it collides with my body and dies. Similarly, UP to (5,1) is its own body, collision. So enemy can only move LEFT to (4,0) or DOWN invalid, so only LEFT to (4,0) is possible? But (4,0) is '.' from board, empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely move LEFT to (4,0) to avoid death.\n\nThus, enemy is not an immediate threat to me.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems better than RIGHT because it gives more flexibility and starts moving towards the top apples.\n\nI could also consider that moving RIGHT to (9,0) is safe but cornered, while UP opens more paths.\n\nSo I'll choose UP.\n\nLast move was RIGHT, which brought me to (8,0). Now moving UP to continue upward.\n\nThus, direction: UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",

Closer to apple at (6, 4), but we need to go around other apples and avoid walls.\n- Moving to (4, 6) (DOWN):\n  - Obstacle at (4, 4)? Not currently, but moving down may lead us toward the apple at (6, 4).\n- Moving to (3, 7) (LEFT):\n  - No immediate obstacle, but may not be strategic unless heading toward the apples on the left side.\n- Moving to (5, 7) (RIGHT):\n  - No obstacle, but the apples are predominantly on the right side at (6, 1), (6, 2), and (6, 4).\n\nPriority is to reach apples efficiently:\n\n- The apple at (6, 4) is relatively close. The path would be moving right (towards x=6), and then down to y=4.\n- The apple at (6, 2) is further down.\n\nNext, I notice that trying to go directly toward (6, 4) from current position (4, 7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT: (5, 7), then (6, 7), then down to (6, 4). But I need to ensure the path is clear. \n- Moving DOWN from (4, 7) to (4, 6): no obstacle appears, but that would miss the apple at (6, 4).\n\nBecause the apples are mostly on the right, and the left side is clear, perhaps moving RIGHT is the best initial move to approach the right-side apples.\n\nAlso, I should avoid moving into positions where enemy snakes are located:\n\n- Enemy at (0, 2): far away.\n- Enemy at (0, 2): no direct threat ahead.\n\nThe next step is moving RIGHT to (5, 7). Then, in subsequent moves, move toward (6, 4).\n\nThis plan avoids immediate obstacles and positions me well to chase the apple.\n\nHence, my next move is: RIGHT.\n\n**Next turn strategy:**\n- After moving right, plan to move towards (6, 4) by moving right to (6, 7), then down to (6, 4), while avoiding walls and enemies.\n\nMy final answer: **RIGHT**.",

            "rationale": "<think> This tag is not visible to the user and the user is unaware of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The board is 10x10, with apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4), (0,9), and (1,6). My snake is at (0,2) with an empty body, meaning I'm just the head right now. There's one enemy snake at (4,7) also with an empty body.\n\nThe board state shows:\n- At (0,2): that's me, snake 0.\n- Apples: (6,2) is directly to the right on the same row, (6,1) is down-right, (6,4) is up-right, (0,9) is straight up but far away, and (1,6) is up and a bit right.\n\nI'm currently at (0,2). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (0,3) \u2013 no apple there, just empty.\n- DOWN: to (0,1) \u2013 but that might be risky if I'm near the bottom? Wait, y=0 is bottom, so y=1 is above bottom. Down to (0,1) is safe unless there's an obstacle. No apple at (0,1) per the board.\n- LEFT: to (-1,2) \u2013 that's off the board! Since x ranges from 0 to 9, x=-1 is invalid. I'd die if I go left. So LEFT is not an option.\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) \u2013 no apple there, but it moves me toward the apples at x=6.\n\nApples are clustered around (6,1), (6,2), (6,4). (6,2) is on the same y-level as me, just 6 steps right. (6,1) is one down from that, and (6,4) is two up.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (0,9) which is directly above me at the top row, but that's 7 steps up with no obstacles \u2013 but I might not get there first, and it's far. (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is closer in terms of y but x is only 1 step away.\n\nEnemy snake at (4,7). That's far from me right now \u2013 x=4, y=7. I'm at (0,2), so they're 4 units right and 5 up. Not an immediate threat.\n\nSince my body is empty, I don't have to worry about running into myself. Only risks are walls, enemy snakes, or possibly running into the enemy if they move toward me.\n\nImmediate goal: get to an apple to grow. The closest apples are at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4). Among these, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right repeatedly, I can reach it in 6 moves. But I need to avoid dying.\n\nLeft is invalid, as I'd hit the wall. So I can't go left.\n\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3), that's safe but doesn't get me closer to apples quickly. (0,3) has no apple, and I'm moving away from (6,1) and (6,2) which are below or same level.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so if I go down to (0,1), I'm closer to y=1 but still need to go right. But (0,1) might not be beneficial.\n\nRight to (1,2) gets me closer to the apples at x=6.\n\nThere's also an apple at (1,6), which is at x=1, y=6. That's only one step right and then up. From (0,2), if I go RIGHT to (1,2), then I can plan to go up towards (1,6). But (1,6) is 4 steps up from (1,2), and there might be competition.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is 7 steps up from my current position, but no one is near it? Enemy is at (4,7), which is closer to (0,9)? (4,7) to (0,9) is distance |4-0| + |7-9| = 4+2=6, while I am |0-0| + |2-9|=7, so enemy is closer to (0,9). But since both snakes are small, it might be a race.\n\nBut the apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,4) are more clustered and might be easier to get multiple.\n\nPrioritize the closest apple. What is the Manhattan distance?\n\nTo (6,2): |0-6| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6\nTo (6,1): |0-6| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7\nTo (6,4): |0-6| + |2-4| = 6 + 2 = 8\nTo (0,9): |0-0| + |2-9| = 0 + 7 = 7\nTo (1,6): |0-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOh! (1,6) is only distance 5 away, and it's an apple. That seems closer than (6,2) at distance 6.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go right to x=1 and up to y=6. From (0,2), I can go RIGHT to (1,2), then UP multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, the enemy snake is at (4,7), which is |4-1| + |7-6| = 3+1=4 from (1,6), so enemy is closer to (1,6) than I am. I'm at distance 5, enemy at distance 4, so if both head directly, enemy might get it first.\n\nBut I don't know where enemy is moving. They might not go for (1,6).\n\nOther apples: (0,9) is distance 7 for me, distance |4-0| + |7-9| =4+2=6 for enemy, so enemy closer.\n\n(6,2) is distance 6 for me, |4-6| + |7-2| =2+5=7 for enemy, so I might have a chance.\n\n(6,1) distance 7 for me, |4-6| + |7-1| =2+6=8 for enemy.\n\n(6,4) distance 8 for me, |4-6| + |7-4| =2+3=5 for enemy, so enemy closer to (6,4).\n\nSo for (1,6): I am dist 5, enemy dist 4 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(0,9): me dist 7, enemy dist 6 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n(6,2): me dist 6, enemy dist 7 \u2013 I have slight advantage.\n(6,1): me dist 7, enemy dist 8 \u2013 I have advantage.\n(6,4): me dist 8, enemy dist 5 \u2013 enemy advantage.\n\nTherefore, the apples where I have a distance advantage are (6,2) and (6,1). (6,2) is closer to me.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is on the same row, so if I go right, I can reach it directly.\n\nBut to go right, I need to move step by step. From (0,2), RIGHT to (1,2), then (2,2), etc., until (6,2).\n\nNo obstacles in the way? Board shows:\nAt y=2: positions: (0,2) is me, (1,2) is empty, (2,2) not shown so empty, ..., up to (6,2) is apple.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (6,1) is apple, but that's below.\n\nEnemy is at (4,7), which is not on my path.\n\nSo going right seems safe for now.\n\nWhat about going down? To (0,1). But (0,1) has no apple, and I'd be moving away from (6,2). Then from (0,1), I could go right to (1,1), but that doesn't help much.\n\nOr I could go down to (0,1) and then right towards (6,1), which is an apple at (6,1). Distance to (6,1) is 7, same as above.\n\nBut from (0,2), going down to (0,1) puts me at y=1, which is closer to (6,1) but farther from (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is closer and I have advantage, better to go for (6,2).\n\nMoreover, after getting (6,2), I might be able to get (6,1) or (6,4) next.\n\nAlso, going right now starts me on that path.\n\nBut what about the apple at (1,6)? It's tempting because it's Manhattan distance 5, but with enemy closer, it's risky. I might not get it.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (0,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nSo best move is RIGHT towards (6,2).\n\nThen, after moving right, I'll be at (1,2), and can continue right next turns.\n\nIs there any immediate danger? At (1,2), it should be safe. No snake or wall there.\n\nEnemy might move, but they are far away.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: continue right towards the apple at (6,2), and be aware of enemy movements.\n\n</think>\n\nI will move RIGHT to start heading towards the apple at (6,2), which is the closest apple where I have a distance advantage over the enemy snake. This move is safe as it avoids walls and other snakes, and positions me to potentially collect multiple apples in that area. Next turn, I should continue moving right if possible to reach the apple faster.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

No immediate obstacle, but less optimal because our goal is to reach the 6th column quickly.\n- Moving RIGHT: (6,7). Moving right to the apple column closest to our position makes sense.\n\nGiven there is no obstacle in moving right and that it brings us closer to the apples, the best choice is to proceed RIGHT.\n\nNext turn, once at (6,7), I can move down toward (6,4). Moving into (6,7) seems safe, and the path appears clear.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\n**Next move: RIGHT.**",

But the enemy at (5,7) is closer to it (|5-1| + |7-6|=4+1=5 vs my 4? Wait: my distance is |1-1| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4. Enemy distance is |5-1| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5. So I\u2019m slightly closer. However, moving directly up to (1,6) would require 4 UP moves, but I can only move one step per turn. \n- The (6,2) apple is 5 units away (|1-6| + |2-2|=5+0=5). Enemy is farther from it (|5-6| + |7-2|=1+5=6). \n- (1,6) is tempting due to proximity, but going UP now would take me away from the denser apple cluster at x=6. \n- LEFT to (0,2) moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and enemy is closer to it.\n- DOWN to (1,1) gets me closer to (6,1) but that apple is 5 units away vs 4 to (1,6).\n\nBest immediate move is RIGHT to (2,2):\n- Puts me on a direct path toward (6,2), where I have a slight time advantage over the enemy.\n- Avoids the wall (no risk since x=2 is within bounds).\n- Not moving toward the enemy\u2019s position (5,7), which is distant.\n- After this, I can continue RIGHT to (3,2), (4,2), etc., to reach (6,2) in 4 more moves.\n\nFor next turn: Plan to go RIGHT again unless the board changes significantly.

So it's also just a head.\n\nPossible moves from my current position (2,2):\n- **UP**: to (2,3) \u2192 empty space, no apple.\n- **DOWN**: to (2,1) \u2192 empty space, and an apple at (6,1) is below-right but not directly on this path.\n- **LEFT**: to (1,2) \u2192 empty space (since I was just there and moved away, so it should be empty now).\n- **RIGHT**: to (3,2) \u2192 empty space, and this continues toward the apple at (6,2).\n\n**Analysis of options:**\n- **UP (to 2,3)**: This moves me toward the center of the board but doesn't directly target any apple. The closest apple in this direction would be (6,4) or (1,6), but both are several moves away. It also doesn't align with my current path. Risk is low since no snakes or walls nearby.\n- **DOWN (to 2,1)**: This gets me closer to the apple at (6,1). Manhattan distance to (6,1) is |2-6| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves away (since y=1 is now only 1 down from my current y=2). However, I'd need to go down then right multiple times. But this abandons the (6,2) apple, which is closer horizontally (only 4 units right at same y=2).\n- **LEFT (to 1,2)**: This backtracks to my previous position. It might be safe, but it moves me away from all apples except (0,9), which is far and the enemy at (6,7) is closer to it. Wasteful move.\n- **RIGHT (to 3,2)**: Continues my path toward (6,2). Distance to (6,2) is |3-6| + |2-2| = 3 moves. This is the most direct route to an apple. The enemy is at (6,7), which is 5 units away from (6,2) (in y-direction only), so I might reach it first if I keep moving right.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The cluster of apples at x=6 (y=1,2,4) is valuable. By going right to (3,2), I'm setting myself up to grab (6,2) in 3 moves. After that, I can easily go down to (6,1) or up to (6,4) if they're still there.\n- The apple at (1,6) is tempting\u2014it's only 4 moves away (2 up and 0 left/right? Wait, from (2,2) to (1,6): |2-1| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves). But changing direction to go up would take me away from the x=6 cluster. The enemy at (6,7) might target (1,6) too, but it's farther (|6-1| + |7-6| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves). Still, I have a slight edge if I go for it, but it's less efficient than sticking to my current path.\n- The enemy is at (6,7), which is above the apple cluster. They might move down toward (6,4) or (6,2). I need to be faster.\n- Wall collisions: No move would hit a wall\u2014all positions are within 0-9.\n- Death risk: No snakes or obstacles near (2,2), so all moves are safe for now.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Sticking with RIGHT is optimal. It maintains momentum toward the nearest high-value target (the x=6 apple cluster) and minimizes travel time. \n- After this move, I should continue RIGHT unless something changes (e.g., enemy moves toward me or apples disappear).\n\n**Note for next turn:** If I go to (3,2), I'll be one step closer to (6,2). If the enemy starts moving south, I might need to hurry. Also, watch if new apples spawn or if the enemy changes direction.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nI choose to move RIGHT to continue efficiently toward the apple at (6,2). This keeps me on a direct path with minimal risk and maximizes my chances of collecting it before the enemy can intervene. \n\nFor next turn: Unless new threats appear, I'll move RIGHT again to reach (3,2) and close in on the apple.

That means I'm just the head right now.\n- Apples are at: (6,2), (6,1), (0,9), (1,6), (3,3)\n- Enemy snake (#1) is at (6,4) with body at [(6,5)] - so it has a body segment at (6,5).

But no snake is mentioned there. Perhaps T is a typo or something else. Let me recheck the board state:\n\nActual board state provided:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .   # (1,6) is A\n 5 . . . . . T . . . .   # (5,5) is T? Not explained. Maybe it's a typo? The enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5). Perhaps T is at (5,5) but not mentioned? Or it could be a mistake in the input.

T . . . .\" which would be at (5,5). Since it's not explained, I'll assume it's an obstacle or something. But in standard Snake, only snakes and apples are on the board. Perhaps it's a typo and should be '.'? Or maybe it's the tail of the enemy? But enemy body is at (6,5) which is in row 5? Let's see coordinates: (6,5) is x=6, y=5. In the row labeling, row 5 is y=5. So in the board, at (x=5, y=5) it's marked T, and (x=6, y=5) is part of enemy body? But the enemy body is listed as [(6,5)], so at (6,5). Then (5,5) is separate. Since it's not explained, I'll treat T as an empty space or perhaps a typo. For safety, I'll avoid (5,5) if possible.\n\nNow, my current position: (5,2). From the last move, I was at (4,2) and moved RIGHT to (5,2). Now I need to move from (5,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: to (5,3)\n- DOWN: to (5,1)\n- LEFT: to (4,2)\n- RIGHT: to (6,2)\n\nApples:\n- (6,2) is directly to the RIGHT. If I move RIGHT, I land on (6,2) and eat the apple.\n- (6,1) is below (6,2), so after eating (6,2), I could go DOWN to (6,1).\n- Other apples: (0,9) is far top-left, (1,6) is top-middle, (3,3) is middle-left.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,4), body at (6,5). So it's facing downward? Because the body is at (6,5) which is above (6,4), so it must have moved down to (6,4). Therefore, on its next move, it could go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not UP (since that would hit its own body at (6,5)). Possible moves for enemy:\n- LEFT: to (5,4)\n- RIGHT: to (7,4)\n- DOWN: to (6,3)\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (6,3), it would be moving toward the apple at (6,2) or (6,1).\n\nBut I am at (5,2), and if I move RIGHT to (6,2), I eat the apple immediately. The enemy is at (6,4), so even if it moves DOWN twice, it would take two moves to reach (6,2): first to (6,3), then to (6,2). I can reach (6,2) in one move. So I can definitely get it first.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,2), my snake will grow, so my body will become [(5,2)] (the previous position). Then I'll be at (6,2) with body at [(5,2)].\n\nThen, the apple at (6,1) is directly below. I could move DOWN to (6,1) to eat it, but I need to consider the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,3) this turn, it would be at (6,3) next turn. Then if I move DOWN to (6,1), I'm safe, but the enemy could move DOWN to (6,2) or to (6,2) if it wants, but (6,2) would be empty after I move. However, if the enemy goes to (6,2), it might try to cut me off or something.\n\nBut for now, the immediate move: moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and gets me an apple. No risk of collision because:\n- Walls: (6,2) is within 0-9.\n- Other snakes: Enemy is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (6,2).\n- Myself: I have no body, so no self-collision.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple.\n\nOther options:\n- UP to (5,3): Moves me away from the apples at (6,2) and (6,1). There's an apple at (3,3), but it's farther and I might not get there before others.\n- DOWN to (5,1): Also moves away from the cluster of apples at (6,2) and (6,1). Apple at (6,1) is close, but I could get it next turn if I go RIGHT first.\n- LEFT to (4,2): Backtracks; not useful.\n\nSo, no reason not to go RIGHT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating (6,2), I'll be at (6,2) with body at (5,2). Then I can consider:\n- DOWN to (6,1) for another apple, if the enemy isn't threatening.\n- Or other directions depending on enemy movement.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is clear.\n\nTherefore, my move: RIGHT\n\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I'm at (5,2) with the apple at (6,2) directly to my right. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple immediately, growing my snake. The enemy snake at (6,4) can't reach (6,2) before me, as it would take them at least two moves. Other moves would delay or avoid this opportunity. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

Wait, hold on\u2014the apple at (6,2) appears to be at (6,2) as well, but the enemy snake is at (6,2). So that position is actually occupied by the enemy snake; hence, I can't go into (6,2).\n\nThis is crucial:\n- Since the enemy snake is occupying (6,2), I cannot move into it.\n- Therefore, I need an alternative route to reach other apples or find a safe path.\n\nLooking at other apples:\n- (8,8): far away, less desirable for now.\n- (0,9): at top-left; may not be accessible directly now.\n- (1,6): nearby, but perhaps more complex to reach.\n- (3,3): in the middle, but less accessible now.\n- (6,1): just below (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the enemy.\n\nSince (6,2) is occupied by the enemy, I should avoid moving into it.\n\nMoving downward from (6,4) to (6,3):\n- Is (6,3) occupied or dangerous?\n- (6,3) appears to be free, given current info.\n\nNext, from (6,3):\n- The cell below is (6,2), occupied by the enemy snake.\n- Moving down again from (6,3) would bring me into (6,2)\u2014not possible.\n\nTherefore, instead of moving down, maybe consider moving left or right.\n\nOptions:\n- Moving left: (5,4)\n- Moving right: (7,4)\n\nChecking their surroundings:\n- (5,4): safe if unoccupied.\n- (7,4): safe as well.\n\nAre there apples nearby that can be reached by moving left or right? From our current position:\n- Moving left to (5,4): seems safe.\n- Moving right to (7,4): also seems safe.\n\nNow, which is better?\n- Moving left to (5,4):\n  - Looks like it leads to (5,6) which has an apple at (1,6), not helpful.\n- Moving right to (7,4):\n  - Doesn't immediately lead to an apple either.\n\nPerhaps moving towards the apple at (1,6):\n- To reach (1,6), I could maneuver around.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ostensible goal of the immediate apple at (6,2):\n- Since (6,2) is occupied by the enemy snake, I can't go there.\n\nGiven these observations, perhaps the best move is to move **left** from (6,4) to (5,4), as that provides options for future moves and avoids the obstacle at (6,2).\n\nConclusion:\n- Move left (to (5,4)) to explore safer avenues and avoid the enemy snake occupying (6,2).\n\nNext move: LEFT.",

But that's my body? **\n\nClarifying: The board state says for row 2: \". . . . . T 0 . . .\" \u2014 so at (5,2) it's marked as 'T', but that's my body. Similarly, at row 4: \". . . . . . T . . .\" at (6,4) is the enemy body? But enemy body is at (6,4), so it should be part of snake 1. This seems like a rendering artifact. I think 'T' might represent a snake body segment. In the description, it says \"T\" in positions that are snake bodies. So for row 2: (5,2) is my body, marked 'T', and (6,2) is my head '0'. For row 4: (6,4) is enemy body 'T'? But in row 3, (6,3) is enemy head marked '1'. In row 4, it says (6,4) is 'T', which is consistent with the enemy body. Similarly, in row 2, (5,2) is 'T' for my body. So I'll interpret:\n- '0': my head\n- '1': enemy head\n- 'T': any snake body segment (could be mine or enemy's)\n- 'A': apple\n\nSo corrected board:\n 9: (0,9)='A', others empty\n 8: (8,8)='A'\n 7: all empty\n 6: (1,6)='A'\n 5: all empty? But at (5,5) in previous state? Not present now. Current state has row 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 empty.\n 4: (6,4)='T' (enemy body)\n 3: (3,3)='A', (6,3)='1' (enemy head)\n 2: (5,2)='T' (my body), (6,2)='0' (my head)\n 1: (6,1)='A'\n 0: all empty\n\nSo my snake: head (6,2), body (5,2)\nEnemy snake: head (6,3), body (6,4)\n\nNow, possible moves from my position (6,2):\n- UP: to (6,3) \u2014 but that's where the enemy head is! That would cause a head-to-head collision. Since both heads would be moving, if we collide head-on, both die. So this is dangerous and likely fatal.\n- DOWN: to (6,1) \u2014 that's an apple! I would eat it and grow.\n- LEFT: to (5,2) \u2014 but that's my own body at (5,2). Moving there would cause a collision with myself, so I die.\n- RIGHT: to (7,2) \u2014 empty space.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP and LEFT are fatal.\n\nDOWN leads to eating the apple at (6,1). After eating, my snake would grow: new head at (6,1), body becomes [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so I have two body segments now.\n\nRIGHT leads to (7,2), which is safe but no immediate apple.\n\nNow, consider the enemy at (6,3). Where can it move?\n- UP: to (6,4) \u2014 but that's its own body at (6,4), so collision and death.\n- DOWN: to (6,2) \u2014 but I am at (6,2) currently. If it moves down, it would collide with me. But in the rules, if two snakes move into the same cell, both die. So if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2) while I am there, it dies, and I might die too? Actually, since I am moving away, if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), then enemy would be moving into the space I just left (if I move first). The order of moves: all snakes move simultaneously. So if I move DOWN to (6,1) and enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they land on (6,2) which was my position but I'm leaving it. So (6,2) becomes empty after I leave. Enemy would then be at (6,2) without collision? But my body is at (5,2), not at (6,2) anymore? After I move, my head is at (6,1), and my body is now [(6,2), (5,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) becomes my body. Therefore, if enemy moves to (6,2), it collides with my body at (6,2) and dies. I am safe at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if enemy moves LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) \u2014 safe.\nOr RIGHT from (6,3) to (7,3) \u2014 safe.\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), it dies because (6,2) becomes my body after I move.\n\nTherefore, if I move DOWN, I eat the apple and the enemy might kill itself by moving into my former position. Even if it doesn't, I get the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I avoid immediate threats but gain nothing. Then the enemy might eat the apple at (6,1) if it moves down to (6,2) and then to (6,1). Or if it moves other directions.\n\nSo moving DOWN is beneficial: I get the apple, and there's a chance the enemy dies if it moves down. Even if not, I'm positioned to go for other apples.\n\nStrategy for next move: After moving DOWN to (6,1), I'll have head at (6,1) and body at [(6,2), (5,2)]. Then I can consider moving LEFT to (5,1) or RIGHT to (7,1), or DOWN to (6,0) \u2014 but need to see where apples are and avoid the enemy.\n\nOther apples: (3,3) is close, (1,6) and (0,9) and (8,8) are farther.\n\nBut for now, DOWN is the best move: it secures the apple and might eliminate the enemy if they make a mistake.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the board, my snake at (6,2) has two safe moves: DOWN to eat the apple at (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2). Moving DOWN is optimal as it immediately consumes an apple for growth and positions me advantageously. If the enemy snake at (6,3) moves DOWN, it will collide with my new body segment at (6,2) and die\u2014eliminating a threat. Even if the enemy avoids this, I still gain a point. Moving RIGHT offers no benefit and delays scoring.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (6,1), assess enemy position and target nearest apples like (3,3) or (8,8).

I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLet's see the possible moves from (6,0):\n\n- UP: to (6,1). But (6,1) is currently occupied by my own body. If I move there, I collide with myself and die. So UP is not possible. It would be suicide.\n\n- DOWN: to (6,-1). But y=-1 is outside the board (since y ranges from 0 to 9). Moving DOWN would hit the wall, and I die. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (5,0). What is at (5,0)? From the board, it's not listed as an apple or a snake. So it should be empty. Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (7,0). At (7,0) there is an apple. So I can move there and eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, possible safe moves are LEFT to (5,0) and RIGHT to (7,0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate:\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0):\n  - I eat the apple at (7,0), so I gain a point and grow. After moving, my head is at (7,0), and my body will extend: the new body will include the old head and body. So the new snake will be: head at (7,0), body segments at (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Since I ate an apple, I grow, so the tail doesn't move yet. Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so the tail stays in place and you add a segment. But at the moment of movement, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. After eating, the snake increases in length.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0):\n  - This is empty, so I just move without eating. My head moves to (5,0), body moves to (6,0) and (6,1), and the tail (6,2) is removed? But since I didn't eat, I don't grow, so the tail moves forward. So new snake: head at (5,0), body at (6,0), and (6,1). The segment at (6,2) is gone.\n\nNow, considering the enemy: The enemy is at (5,2) with body at (5,3). From (5,2), it can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- UP to (5,3): but (5,3) is its own body, so suicide. Not likely.\n- DOWN to (5,1): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (4,2): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,2): but (6,2) is my body segment. If it moves there, it collides with my body and dies. So it might avoid that.\n\nBut I don't control the enemy, so I have to assume it might do anything. However, I should choose a move that minimizes risk and maximizes gain.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) to eat the apple is immediately beneficial. I get a point and grow. Also, it positions me to go up or left next turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) doesn't give me anything, and I might be closer to the enemy, but at (5,0) I'm below the enemy head at (5,2). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then it could be adjacent to me, but not necessarily colliding this turn.\n\nMoreover, after moving RIGHT to (7,0), I can consider going UP to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,0) but (6,0) will be my body, so I can only go UP or perhaps RIGHT to (8,0) if possible, but (8,0) might be out of bounds? x=8, y=0 is within 0-9.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there's an apple at (1,6), (3,3), (0,9), (8,8). After eating at (7,0), I can plan to go towards (8,8) or (3,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,0) might allow me to go up to (5,1) and then towards (3,3) or (1,6), but without the immediate benefit of eating.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is better.\n\nAlso, note that the enemy might be a threat. If I move LEFT to (5,0), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,1), then next turn it could move DOWN again to (5,0) if I'm still there, causing a head-on collision if I don't move. But since I would move, it might not happen. Still, it's riskier than moving RIGHT to eat safely.\n\nSo RIGHT is the clear choice.\n\nStrategy next turn: From (7,0), move UP to (7,1) to start heading towards the center or other apples. But I'll reassess based on the board.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating the current board state, I see that moving UP or DOWN would lead to death (UP into my own body at (6,1) or DOWN off the board). Moving LEFT to (5,0) is safe but offers no immediate reward. Moving RIGHT to (7,0) allows me to consume the apple, gaining a point and growing. This is the optimal move as it secures a point and positions me near the board's edge for potential upward movement next turn. \n\nStrategy for next turn: From (7,0), prioritize moving UP to (7,1) to target apples like (8,8) or (3,3), while monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nDirection: RIGHT",

The apple at (7,0) is adjacent to my head to the right.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at head position (5,2) with body segment at (5,3).\n\nPossible moves from my head (6,0):\n\n- UP: (6,1) - Occupied by my body segment. Moving here would cause a collision with myself. Invalid.\n- DOWN: (6,-1) - This is outside the board (y-coordinate < 0). Moving off the board is invalid and fatal.\n- LEFT: (5,0) - Currently unoccupied. Safe to move.\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - Occupied by an apple. Moving here would eat the apple and grow my snake.\n\nEvaluating options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (5,0): Safe but doesn't provide any immediate benefit. I don't eat an apple, so I don't grow or gain points. It also moves me closer to the enemy snake at (5,2), which could be risky if the enemy moves downward.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,0): I eat the apple, gain a point, and grow. This is clearly the best move for immediate gain. After moving, my head will be at (7,0), and my body will extend to include the old head position, so my new body will be segments at (6,0), (6,1), and (6,2). I grow by one segment.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- The enemy snake at (5,2) could move downward to (5,1) or (5,0), but even if it moves to (5,1) this turn, it won't threaten me until next turn. By then, I'll have moved away from (7,0). Eating the apple now gives me an advantage.\n\nFuture planning:\n- After moving to (7,0), my next moves could include UP to (7,1) to start heading toward other apples like (8,8) or (3,3). I'll need to avoid the board edges and enemy snakes.\n\nConclusion:\nMoving RIGHT to (7,0) is the optimal move because it:\n1. Avoids collisions (unlike UP or DOWN)\n2. Gains a point by eating the apple\n3. Grows my snake, giving me more presence on the board\n4. Positions me better for future moves toward other apples\n\nTherefore, I will move RIGHT.\n\n</think>\n\nRIGHT",

T T . . .   // T is body segment? Actually, from the board, it shows T for body? But in positions, it's given as numbers and letters. Let's decode the board:\n\nFrom the board state:\n\" 9 A . . . . . . . . .\" -> (0,9) is A\n\" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" -> (7,8) and (8,8) are A? Wait: positions given are (0,9), (1,6), (3,3), (8,8), (7,8) \u2014 so (7,8) and (8,8) are both apples.\n\nIn the board string:\n\" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" \u2014 this means at x=7,y=8 and x=8,y=8 are apples? Because it's from x=0 to 9.\n\nAlso, \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 at y=1, x=5 and x=6 are 'T'? But in the snake body, enemy snake #1 has body at [(5,1)]? Let's see:\n\nEnemy snake #1 position: head at (5,0) with body at [(5,1)].\n\nIn the board:\n\" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 this is y=0 row: at x=5: '1' (enemy head), x=6: 'T' (body?), x=7: 'T', x=8: '0' (my head), but wait:\n\nMy snake: head at (8,0) with body at [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)]\n\nSo at y=0:\nx=5: '1' \u2014 enemy head\nx=6: should be my body? But it shows 'T'? And x=7: 'T' \u2014 that should be my body segment at (7,0)\nx=8: '0' \u2014 my head.\n\nBut also, (6,1) is my body, which is at y=1, x=6. In the y=1 row: \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 at x=6: 'T' and x=5: '.'? No, it says \" . . . . . T T . . .\" for y=1, so at x=5: '.' and x=6: 'T'? But enemy snake #1 body is at (5,1)? That should be at y=1, x=5.\n\nIn the board for y=1: \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 positions: x=0 to 9: so x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T'? Or is it \" . . . . . T T . . .\" meaning from the start: first character is x=0, which is '.', then x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', etc.\n\nBut enemy snake #1 has a body segment at (5,1), so at (x=5,y=1) should be part of enemy body. So the board shows it as 'T'? Similarly, my body at (6,1) is also at (x=6,y=1), which is also shown as 'T'.\n\nSo in the board, 'T' probably means a body segment of any snake. Head is shown as the snake ID: '0' for me, '1' for enemy.\n\nNow, my current head position: (8,0). Body: (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). So at (8,0): head, (7,0): body, (6,0): body, and (6,1): body.\n\nPossible moves from (8,0):\n\n- UP: (8,1) \u2014 what's there? From the board, at y=1, x=8: in the string \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 for y=1, it's \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 so x=8 is '.'? Let's count: positions for y=1: x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'? The string is \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 that's 10 characters? \" . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 spaces? The board is shown with leading y-coordinate, then 10 characters.\n\nIn the board state:\n\" 9 A . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 that's 10 dots/letters after \"9 \"\nSimilarly, \" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" \u2014 10 characters: . . . . . . . A A . \u2192 10 positions.\n\nFor y=1: \" 1 . . . . . T T . . .\" \u2014 after \"1 \" there are 10 characters: first is '.', then '.', '.', '.', '.', 'T', 'T', '.', '.', '.' \u2014 so positions:\nx=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: 'T', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'\n\nSimilarly, y=0: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 that's after \"0 \" : 10 characters: . . . . . 1 T T 0 . ? But it has spaces? No, it should be without spaces. The text says: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 but that includes spaces? Actually, I think the board is printed with spaces between for readability, but the positions are without spaces. Let me parse:\n\nIt says: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 and it's for x from 0 to 9. So the characters are: first character is '.' (x=0), then space? No, I think the board representation has spaces between the characters for readability, but we should ignore spaces. For example:\n\n\" 9 A . . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 means at y=9: A, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., ., . for x=0 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, \" 8 . . . . . . . A A .\" \u2014 at y=8: ., ., ., ., ., ., ., A, A, . for x=0 to 9.\n\nFor y=0: \" 0 . . . . . 1 T T 0 .\" \u2014 if we remove spaces, it would be: characters are [., ., ., ., ., 1, T, T, 0, .] for x=0 to 9? But it has \"0 \" at the beginning, which is the y-coordinate, then the 10 cells.\n\nSo for y=0: cells are: x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: '1', x=6: 'T', x=7: 'T', x=8: '0', x=9: '.'? But at x=8, it's '0', which is my head, and x=7: 'T' (my body at (7,0)), x=6: 'T' (my body at (6,0)), and x=5: '1' (enemy head at (5,0)).\n\nNow, back to possible moves from my head (8,0):\n\n- UP: to (8,1) \u2014 from board, at (8,1): in y=1 row, x=8 is '.' (empty), so safe to move.\n- DOWN: to (8,-1) \u2014 invalid, off the board (y=-1 doesn't exist).\n- LEFT: to (7,0) \u2014 at (7,0) is currently my body segment? From the board, at y=0, x=7 is 'T', which is a body segment. Specifically, it's part of my own body: my body segments are at (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). So (7,0) is occupied by my body. Moving left to (7,0) would cause a collision with myself. Invalid.\n- RIGHT: to (9,0) \u2014 at y=0, x=9 is '.' (from the board: last character for y=0 is '.' at x=9). So (9,0) is empty. But x=9 is within 0-9? (9,0) is the bottom-right corner, which is valid.\n\nCoordinates: from (0,0) to (9,9). So x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9. (9,0) is on the board.\n\nSo possible moves: UP to (8,1) or RIGHT to (9,0). DOWN is off board, LEFT is into my own body.\n\nApples: there is an apple at (7,8) and (8,8), but they are far away. Also at (0,9), (1,6), (3,3). None are adjacent to me.\n\nMy current position: (8,0). Moving to (9,0) is the right edge, which might be risky in future moves, but for now, it's empty and safe. Moving up to (8,1) is also safe.\n\nWhat about enemy snake? Enemy snake #1 is at (5,0) head, with body at (5,1). So it's not directly threatening me right now. It's at x=5,y=0, I'm at x=8,y=0, so three cells away.\n\nI need to choose between UP and RIGHT.\n\nStrategy: I should head towards apples to grow. The nearest apples might be (8,8) or (7,8), but they are at the top. (0,9) is top-left, (1,6) is left, (3,3) is center-left.\n\nFrom (8,0), moving UP to (8,1) starts going up the right column towards (8,8). Moving RIGHT to (9,0) puts me on the corner, which limits options next turn: from (9,0), I can only go UP (to (9,1)) or LEFT (back to (8,0), but (8,0) will be empty after I move, but it might be risky if enemy comes, but not immediately).\n\nAlso, after moving, my tail will move. My body is: head at (8,0), then (7,0), (6,0), (6,1). When I move, the tail (6,1) will move to (6,0) or something? In snake games, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment, and the tail segment is removed unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince I'm not eating an apple this move (no apple at (8,1) or (9,0)), my snake will not grow, so the tail will be removed. So after move:\n\n- If I move UP to (8,1): new head at (8,1), body becomes: (8,0), (7,0), (6,0). The segment at (6,1) is removed? No: the body segments shift: the segment that was at head position (8,0) becomes the new first body segment, then (7,0) becomes second, then (6,0) becomes third, and the tail (6,1) is removed because no growth. So new body: [(8,0), (7,0), (6,0)].\n\nSimilarly, if I move RIGHT to (9,0): new head at (9,0), body: (8,0), (7,0), (6,0).\n\nNow, considering future paths:\n\nMoving UP to (8,1): from there, I can go LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), or RIGHT to (9,1). (7,1) is empty, (9,1) is empty? From board, y=1, x=7 is '.', x=9 is '.'.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,0): then I can go UP to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,0). (8,0) will be empty after I move, since it's now a body segment but when I move it becomes part of body, but for next move, when I move from (9,0), (8,0) is occupied by my body? Yes, but I can go back to (8,0) only if I have to, but it's generally not good to go backwards into body unless necessary.\n\nBut in this case, after moving to (9,0), the body is at (8,0), (7,0), (6,0). So if I go LEFT to (8,0), that's where my body is, which would be a collision. So from (9,0), I cannot go LEFT back to (8,0) because it's occupied. Only UP to (9,1) is possible? And (9,1) from board is '.'.\n\nSo moving to (9,0) leaves me only one direction: UP to (9,1) next turn, which is okay but limits options.\n\nWhereas moving UP to (8,1) gives me more options: next turn, I can go LEFT to (7,1), UP to (8,2), or RIGHT to (9,1). All of which might be safe.\n\nAlso, to reach the apples at (8,8) or (7,8), going up is better. (8,8) is directly above at (8,8), same x, so moving up multiple times.\n\nBut there are no immediate apples, so I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, enemy snake at (5,0) might be moving. It could move up to (5,1), but (5,1) is its own body? Enemy body is at (5,1), so it cannot move there. It could move LEFT to (4,0), DOWN is off board? (5,-1) invalid, RIGHT to (6,0) \u2014 but (6,0) is my body? Currently, (6,0) is my body segment. So if enemy moves RIGHT to (6,0), it collides with my body and dies. Similarly, UP to (5,1) is its own body, collision. So enemy can only move LEFT to (4,0) or DOWN invalid, so only LEFT to (4,0) is possible? But (4,0) is '.' from board, empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely move LEFT to (4,0) to avoid death.\n\nThus, enemy is not an immediate threat to me.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems better than RIGHT because it gives more flexibility and starts moving towards the top apples.\n\nI could also consider that moving RIGHT to (9,0) is safe but cornered, while UP opens more paths.\n\nSo I'll choose UP.\n\nLast move was RIGHT, which brought me to (8,0). Now moving UP to continue upward.\n\nThus, direction: UP.\n\n</think>\n\nUP",
