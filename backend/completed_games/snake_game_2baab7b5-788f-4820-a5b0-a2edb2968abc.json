The only immediate danger is moving into the enemy's body or head.\n3. **Enemy body/head**: Enemy head is at (3,4). Your possible moves:\n   - Up: (8,2) \u2192 No overlap with enemy head.\n   - Down: (8,4) \u2192 No overlap.\n   - Left: (7,3) \u2192 No overlap.\n   - Right: (9,3) \u2192 No overlap.\n   So all moves are safe in terms of immediate collision.\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n- Closest apple to your head (8,3) is (6,9), (3,8), (0,1), (4,8), (9,7).\n  - Distance to (6,9): Manhattan distance = |8-6| + |3-9| = 2 + 6 = 8\n  - Distance to (3,8): |8-3| + |3-8| = 5 + 5 = 10\n  - Distance to (0,1): |8-0| + |3-1| = 8 + 2 = 10\n  - Distance to (4,8): |8-4| + |3-8| = 4 + 5 = 9\n  - Distance to (9,7): |8-9| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n  The closest apple is (9,7), which is 1 unit right (x+1).\n\n### Enemy Movement:\n- Enemy head is at (3,4). Possible moves for enemy:\n  - Up: (3,3)\n  - Down: (3,5)\n  - Left: (2,4)\n  - Right: (4,4)\n  If enemy moves right to (4,4), it could collide with your head if you move to (8,4) or (9,3). But since we're prioritizing immediate safety, we can ignore this for now.\n\n### Safe Moves:\nAll four directions are safe. Now, we need to prioritize moves that:\n1. Move you closer to the closest apple (9,7).\n2. Avoid trapping yourself or limiting future options.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n1. **Right (9,3)**:\n   - Moves you to (9,3), which is 1 step closer to (9,7).\n   - No immediate danger.\n   - Future options: You can still move up/down/left from here, and the enemy's path is not blocked.\n\n2. **Up (8,2)**:\n   - Not directly closer to (9,7).\n   - Less direct path to the apple.\n\n3. **Down (8,4)**:\n   - Not directly closer to (9,7).\n   - Could be a trap if enemy moves right to (4,4) and you are at (8,4), but this is speculative.\n\n4. **Left (7,3)**:\n   - Not directly closer to (9,7).\n   - Less direct path to the apple.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Short-term**: Prioritize moving towards the closest apple (9,7) to maximize immediate gains.\n- **Mid-term**: Monitor enemy movement and avoid paths that could lead to collisions or traps.\n- **Long-term**: Expand your body to cover more ground and reduce vulnerability to enemy attacks.\n\n### Decision:\nThe most direct and safe move is **Right**.\n\nRIGHT",

The board shows (9,7) as an apple, but the snake is at (9,3), so distance is **4 down**. The next closest is (6,9) (distance 7), then (0,1) (distance 10), etc. The closest is actually **(0,1)** at distance 10, but that\u2019s far. The **next closest is (9,7) at distance 4 down**, then (6,9) at distance 8. The last rationale\u2019s claim of (9,7) being distance 1 was incorrect\u2014likely a typo.\n\n#### **Safe Moves (Eliminating Immediate Death):**\n1. **UP (9,2):** Valid (no overlap with enemy or body).\n2. **DOWN (9,4):** Valid (no overlap).\n3. **LEFT (8,3):** Valid (no overlap).\n4. **RIGHT (10,3):** Invalid (off-board).\n\n#### **Apple Proximity & Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP (9,2):** Distance to (9,7) = 5 (not optimal).\n- **DOWN (9,4):** Distance to (9,7) = 3 (better than UP).\n- **LEFT (8,3):** Distance to (9,7) = 2 (closest!).\n\n#### **Enemy Threat:**\n- Enemy head is at (3,5) (no body yet). No immediate collision risk, but if it grows, it could block paths.\n\n#### **Follow-Up Moves After Each Safe Move:**\n- **UP (9,2) \u2192 Next turn:** Head at (9,1). Possible moves: UP (invalid), DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,2), RIGHT (10,2 invalid). Safe options: DOWN, LEFT.\n- **DOWN (9,4) \u2192 Next turn:** Head at (9,5). Possible moves: UP (9,4), DOWN (9,6), LEFT (8,5), RIGHT (10,5 invalid). Safe options: UP, LEFT.\n- **LEFT (8,3) \u2192 Next turn:** Head at (8,2). Possible moves: UP (8,1), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,2), RIGHT (9,2). Safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n#### **Best Move:**\n- **LEFT (8,3)** is the best because:\n  - It moves the snake **closer to the closest apple (9,7)** (distance 2 down).\n  - It leaves the most options for future moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n  - It avoids blocking future paths (unlike UP or DOWN, which could trap the snake).\n\n#### **Enemy\u2019s Next Move:**\n- The enemy is at (3,5). If it moves UP (3,4), LEFT (2,5), DOWN (3,6), or RIGHT (4,5), it could block paths, but no immediate collision risk.\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**LEFT**",
