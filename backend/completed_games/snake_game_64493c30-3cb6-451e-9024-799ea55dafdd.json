          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "**Initial Plan:** My snake (ID 1) is at (2, 4) and has a length of 1 (just the head). The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (8, 7) and also has a length of 1. There are many apples on the board. Since both snakes are just heads, we cannot collide with each other's bodies, but we can collide head-on. I must avoid the enemy snake's body and potential head-on collisions. The enemy snake is at (8, 7), which is far from me. I should look for nearby apples and plan a route that avoids the enemy and potential traps. The nearest apples to me appear to be at (0, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, something? Actually (2,4) is my head, no apple there), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5,9), (6,1), (7,3), (8,0), (8,1), (8,8), (9,1), (9,6). Looking at the board state: I am at (2,4). The apple at (0,4) is directly to my left on the same y-level. That seems safe and close. But wait, moving left from (2,4) to (1,4) and then to (0,4) would require two moves. However, the enemy snake is far away. Let's check immediate safety of moving LEFT to (1,4). (1,4) is empty on the board map (row 4: \"A . 1 . . . . . . .\" Wait, the map shows row 4: \"A . 1 . . . . . . .\". That's (0,4) is 'A', (1,4) is '.' (empty), (2,4) is '1' (my head). So (1,4) is empty. No snakes there. So LEFT is safe. Moving DOWN to (2,3): Row 3 is \". . . . A . . A . .\". (2,3) is empty? Let's check coordinates: Row 3, column 2 is '.' (since columns 0-9: 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 'A', ...). Yes, (2,3) is empty. Moving RIGHT to (3,4): Row 4, col 3 is '.' (empty). Moving UP to (2,5): Row 5 is all '.' (empty). So all four directions seem safe immediately regarding obstacles. However, I need to consider the enemy snake's move. The enemy is at (8,7). It could move towards apples. I don't know its strategy, but I should assume it might move towards me or apples. Since I am at (2,4) and it is at (8,7), the distance is significant. I should prioritize eating apples to grow. The closest apple is at (0,4). Moving LEFT seems the most direct path to an apple. However, if I go LEFT, I will eventually need to turn to eat other apples. But for now, moving LEFT gets me closer to (0,4). Let's verify if there are any immediate threats. Since I have no body, I cannot hit myself. I cannot hit the enemy's body (it has no body). The only danger is moving into the enemy's head if it moves into the same cell as my next move. The enemy is at (8,7). It cannot reach (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,4) or (2,5) in one move because its maximum move distance is 1 in cardinal directions. From (8,7), moving left goes to (7,7), right to (9,7), up to (8,8), down to (8,6). None of these are adjacent to my current position (2,4), and certainly not the cells I am considering moving to. So collision is impossible this turn. Therefore, I am safe from immediate collision regardless of the enemy's move. Thus, I should choose a move that maximizes my progress. The apple at (0,4) is a clear target. Moving LEFT is the correct choice to approach it.\n\n**Move Selection:** I will move LEFT to (1,4).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nLEFT",

Apples are scattered.\n- **Immediate Safety Check:**\n  - **UP** to (1,5): Empty (row 5 is all '.'), safe.\n  - **DOWN** to (1,3): Empty (row 3, col 1 is '.'), safe.\n  - **LEFT** to (0,4): **APPLE**. Board shows 'A' at (0,4). Safe as it's empty.\n  - **RIGHT** to (2,4): Empty (row 4, col 2 is '.'), safe.\n- **Strategic Assessment:**\n  - **Immediate Gain:** Moving **LEFT** to (0,4) is the only move that yields an apple this turn, granting +1 length and +1 score. This is optimal for growth.\n  - **Risk:** No immediate collision threat. Snake #0 is far away (8,8), and even if it moves aggressively, it cannot reach me this turn.\n  - **Future Positioning:** Eating at (0,4) clears a corner. While corners can be limiting, this apple is directly adjacent and worth the immediate point. After eating, I will be at (0,4) with a tail at (1,4) (if I had length 2), but currently length 1 so no tail yet. This move sets up a path to collect more apples in the lower-left quadrant (e.g., (1,7), (1,8), (0,4) is eaten).\n- **Conclusion:** **LEFT** maximizes point gain this turn with zero risk. It is the clear best move.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Note for Future Self):**\nAfter eating the apple at (0,4), my immediate goal is to collect adjacent apples safely. I should avoid being trapped in the left edge. I will likely move up toward (1,7) and (1,8) in subsequent turns, while monitoring Snake #0's position. If Snake #0 heads toward the center/left, I may need to maneuver to avoid head-on collisions. Prioritize apples while keeping escape routes open.\n\nLEFT",

Length = 2 (Head + 1 Body segment).\n    - **Restrictions:**\n        - I cannot move **RIGHT** back to (1,4) because that is my immediate tail (backwards). This is a collision with self.\n        - **LEFT** is off the board (x=-1). This is death.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7,8). Body at (8,8).\n    - The board shows '0' at (7,8) and 'T' (tail) at (8,8).\n    - The text description lists Body as [(8,8)], which is consistent.\n    - Enemy is far away (Manhattan distance ~12). They cannot reach me this turn or the next few turns.\n\n**2. Evaluating Viable Moves:**\n- **LEFT:** Off board (x = -1). **DEAD**.\n- **RIGHT:** To (1,4). Currently occupied by my own tail. **DEAD** (backwards move).\n- **DOWN:** To (0,3).\n    - Check map: Row 3 (y=3) at x=0 is '.' (empty).\n    - No snake body there.\n    - **Safe.**\n- **UP:** To (0,5).\n    - Check map: Row 5 (y=5) at x=0 is '.' (empty).\n    - No snake body there.\n    - **Safe.**\n\n**3. Strategic Selection:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN (to 0,3) or UP (to 0,5).\n\n*   **Option: DOWN to (0,3)**\n    *   **Pros:** The board shows an apple at (0,4) (where I am now, just eaten or just moved from? Wait, last turn I was at (0,4) and ate the apple. My body is now (1,4). The apple at (0,4) is gone. The board visualization is static/simplified and shows 'A' at (0,4) in the ASCII, but logically that apple is consumed or part of my body? Actually, looking at the ASCII: `4 1 T . . . . . . . .` -> Row 4, Col 0 is '1'. Wait, the ASCII map shows `1` at (0,4). The head is at (0,4). The apple listed is at (0,4) in the text \"Apples at:\". This is a conflict between the ASCII map (which marks the head) and the list. The list is authoritative for apples. If I was at (0,4) last turn and ate an apple, the apple is gone. The ASCII map `1 T` indicates Head `1` and Tail `T`.\n    *   Looking at the ASCII map again: `4 1 T . . . . . . . .` (Row 4). `1` is at x=0, `T` is at x=1.\n    *   The text says Apples at: `(8, 1), (5, 9), (1, 7), (4, 2), (9, 1), (1, 8), (9, 6), (4, 3), (8, 0), (7, 3), (5, 2), (3, 2), (6, 1), (7, 5), (6, 5)`.\n    *   There is NO apple at (0,3) or (0,5).\n    *   Therefore, neither move grabs an apple immediately.\n    *   **Future Outlook:** (0,3) is near `(3, 2)` and `(4, 2)`, but blocked by the left wall. It is a dead end.\n*   **Option: UP to (0,5)**\n    *   **Pros:** Moves away from the bottom-left corner.\n    *   **Future Outlook:** (0,5) allows access to `(1,7)` and `(1,8)` (apples listed) via a safer path along the left edge or opening up to column 1. It keeps options open.\n    *   (0,3) is a dead end. (0,5) is safer for long-term survival.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to (0,5) is the only move that avoids immediate corners and keeps future paths available. (0,3) is a trap.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move up towards the apples at (1,7) and (1,8). Avoid getting boxed in by the left wall. Monitor the enemy snake (ID 0) moving from (7,8); currently distant.\n\nUP",

Body is [(0,4)]. Length = 2.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (7,9). Body is [(7,8)]. Length = 2.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Moves (From (0,5)):**\n- **LEFT (x=-1):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n- **RIGHT (to (1,5)):** Open '.' on map. No snake bodies there. **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN (to (0,4)):** Currently occupied by my own body (tail). This is moving backwards into self. **DEAD**.\n- **UP (to (0,6)):** Open '.' on map. **SAFE**.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nI have two safe moves: RIGHT to (1,5) or UP to (0,6).\n\n- **Option: UP to (0,6)**\n    - **Pros:** Stays against the left wall. Safe immediately.\n    - **Cons:** Limited space. The next move from (0,6) would be limited to (0,7) or (1,6). From there, heading toward apples at (1,7) and (1,8) might require squeezing past tight spots or backtracking.\n    - **Apple Reachability:** The closest apples are (1,7), (1,8), and (3,2) (via down). (0,6) is close to (1,7) but (0,7) is empty, and (0,8) contains an enemy tail 'T'.\n    - **Dead End Risk:** (0,6) -> (0,7) -> (0,8) is blocked by Enemy Tail. (0,8) is safe to enter (enemies die if their tail is eaten, but here the tail moves *away* next turn because the head moves). Wait, the enemy tail is static in the turn description, but actually moves as the snake slides. If I move to (0,7) now, and the enemy head moves (from 7,9), the enemy tail at (7,8) might not move until the *next* turn (depending on growth). Actually, if the enemy doesn't eat, the tail follows the head. The current enemy tail is at (7,8). If the enemy moves from (7,9), the body segment (7,8) becomes the new tail or moves? With length 2: Head(7,9) -> Body(7,8). If Head moves to (7,8), Body becomes (7,7) (or is eaten if not growing). The map shows Enemy Tail at (8,8)? Wait, looking at the prompt: `9 . . . . . A . 0 . .` (Row 9, col 7 is '0'). `8 . A . . . . . T . .` (Row 8, col 7 is 'T').\n    - Correction: The Enemy Head is at (7,9). The Enemy Tail is at (7,8) according to text, but the ASCII map shows 'T' at (8,8) and '0' at (7,9)? No, ASCII map Row 9: `7 . . . . . . . 0 . .` (Col 7 is 0?). Wait, the map is a visual representation.\n    - Let's look at the board map again:\n      Row 9: `9 . . . . . A . 0 . .` (Indices 0-9). The '0' is at index 7. So (7,9) is Head.\n      Row 8: `8 . A . . . . . T . .` (Indices 0-9). The 'T' is at index 7. So (7,8) is Tail.\n    - The text says Body: [(7,8)]. This matches the map.\n    - If I go UP to (0,6), I am moving into the top-left corner.\n    - If I go RIGHT to (1,5), I open up access to the entire board.\n    - **Pathing:** (1,5) connects to (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) (Apple). Also connects to (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (1,7) (Apple).\n    - **Safety:** Moving to (1,5) keeps my back to the open board (column 0 is empty behind me). I have space to retreat.\n    - **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is at (7,9). They are far away. They might move to (6,9), (8,9), or (7,8). (7,8) is their own body, so they won't go there unless growing? They can't eat an apple at (8,8) (it's their tail). They might go Left to (6,9) or Down to (7,8) (suicide) or Right (8,9). (8,9) is empty.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT to (1,5)** is strictly superior to UP.\n- **RIGHT** gives me access to the large open area of the board.\n- **RIGHT** avoids trapping myself in the top-left corner, where I would be blocked by the wall and potentially the enemy's tail at (0,8) or (7,8) depending on movement.\n- **RIGHT** provides more immediate options for the next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nBreak out to the center from the left wall. Head towards the apple cluster at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). Monitor enemy snake #0 at (7,9) to ensure they don't cut off access to the right side.\n\n**RIGHT**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

A . . . . . T . .`. The 'T' is at (7,8).\n    - *Correction:* The ASCII map is slightly ambiguous. Row 9: `9 . . . . . A . 0 . .` (Col 7 is '0'). Row 8: `8 . A . . . . . T . .` (Col 7 is 'T').\n    - The prompt text says: Head: (6, 9), Body: [(7, 9)].\n    - If Head is (6,9) and Body is (7,9), then the ASCII map must be interpreted as Head at (6,9) and Tail at (7,9)? No, the ASCII map shows '0' at (7,9) and 'T' at (7,8).\n    - Let's trust the ASCII map visual over the text description if there is a discrepancy, or reconcile them. Map shows '0' at (7,9). Map shows 'T' at (7,8). Text says Head (6,9), Body [(7,9)].\n    - If the text is correct (Head 6,9), then the map '0' at (7,9) is wrong or represents the body? No, usually '0' is head.\n    - Let's look closely at the map provided in the prompt:\n      `9 . . . . . A . 0 . .`\n      The '0' is at index 7 (0-indexed columns). So (7,9).\n      `8 . A . . . . . T . .`\n      The 'T' is at index 7. So (7,8).\n      Text says: Head: (6, 9), Body: [(7, 9)].\n      This is inconsistent. The map implies Head is (7,9) and Tail is (7,8).\n      However, the text is usually the authoritative source for coordinates. If the text says Head is (6,9), then the map '0' is likely a mistake or I'm misreading the map spacing.\n      Let's re-read the map row 9: `9 . . . . .

The ASCII map is a visual aid which might be simplified or slightly offset.\n      Text: Head (6,9), Body [(7,9)].\n      This means the snake occupies (6,9) and (7,9).\n      The map shows '0' at (7,9). This suggests the map might be showing the body part as '0' or the text is wrong.\n      **Let's assume the ASCII map is roughly correct for visualization but the text is the strict rule.**\n      If Head is (6,9) and Body is (7,9), then the '0' on the map at (7,9) represents the body segment (which is unusual, usually head is 0). Or the text is wrong and Head is (7,9) and Body is [(6,9)]? No, text says Body [(7,9)].\n      **Hypothesis:** The enemy snake is at (6,9) and (7,9). The '0' at (7,9) on the map is likely just a visual representation of the snake occupying that tile, but strictly speaking, the Head is at (6,9).\n      **Let's proceed with the text coordinates:** Enemy Head (6,9), Enemy Body (7,9).\n      Wait, if Head is (6,9) and Body is (7,9), the snake is horizontal.\n      Map shows '0' at (7,9) and 'T' at (7,8).\n      If Text is right: Head(6,9), Body(7,9).\n      If Map is right: Head(7,9), Tail(7,8).\n      The Map 'T' at (7,8) implies the tail is there. If Head is (6,9), the tail should be at (7,9) (last turn's head).\n      If Head is (7,9), the tail would be (6,9) (if didn't grow) or (7,8) (if grew and moved).\n      Given the map shows 'T' at (7,8), it's likely the snake is vertical at (7,9) and (7,8).\n      **Let's assume the map is the most accurate visual snapshot of the board state.**\n      Map: Head '0' at (7,9). Tail 'T' at (7,8).\n      I will plan based on the Map visual: Enemy Head (7,9), Enemy Tail (7,8).\n      *Self-Correction:* The prompt says \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 9), Body: [(7, 9)]\". This is very specific.\n      If Head is (6,9) and Body is (7,9), they are adjacent horizontally.\n      If Map shows '0' at (7,9) and 'T' at (7,8), it's a contradiction.\n      **Let's prioritize the Text Description.** It is the game state logic.\n      Enemy Head: (6,9).\n      Enemy Body: (7,9).\n      Map Visualization: Maybe the '0' is just a generic snake marker and the 'T' is the tail? But (7,8) is not connected to (6,9).\n      Okay, I will trust the text: Enemy Head (6,9), Body (7,9).\n      This means the Enemy is to my right and up.\n      Enemy Head (6,9) is far away (vertical distance 4, horizontal distance 5).\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves from (1,5):**\n- **Current Body:** [(0,5)].\n- **Apple at (1,5)?** No, (1,5) is empty.\n- **Apples nearby:** (1,7), (1,8) are close UP. (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) are DOWN-LEFT.\n\n- **Option 1: UP to (1,6)**\n    - Is (1,6) safe? Yes, map shows '.'.\n    - Is (1,6) occupied by my body? No.\n    - Is it occupied by Enemy Body? No.\n    - **Pros:** Moves towards apples at (1,7) and (1,8).\n    - **Cons:** (1,6) is in column 1. To get to (1,7), I go to (1,6) -> (1,7). To get to (1,8), I go (1,7) -> (1,8).\n    - **Trapping Risk:** If I go to (1,6), my body is at (0,5) and (1,5). From (1,6), I can go UP to (1,7), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6), or DOWN to (1,5) (which will be occupied by my body then? No, my body moves).\n    - If I eat the apple at (1,7), I grow. If I don't eat, my tail moves from (0,5) to (1,5).\n    - The space at (1,6) is open.\n\n- **Option 2: RIGHT to (2,5)**\n    - Is (2,5) safe? Yes, map shows '.'.\n    - **Pros:** Opens up the center of the board.\n    - **Cons:** Moves away from the immediate apples at (1,7) and (1,8).\n\n- **Option 3: DOWN to (1,4)**\n    - Is (1,4) safe? Yes, map shows '.'.\n    - **Pros:** Moves towards the cluster of apples at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\n    - **Cons:** (1,4) is a bit of a dead end if I go further down? (1,3) is '.' (map shows row 3 col 1 is '.'). (1,2) is '.'.\n    - Actually, the apple cluster is at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). To reach them from (1,4), I can go (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n    - This path is valid.\n\n- **Option 4: LEFT to (0,5)**\n    - Is (0,5) safe? My body is currently at (0,5). My tail is there.\n    - **Rules:** Moving into your own body (including backwards) kills you.\n    - My head is at (1,5). My body is at (0,5). Moving LEFT goes to (0,5). This is moving directly backwards into my tail.\n    - **DEAD.**\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison:**\n- **UP (1,6):**\n    - Target: Apples at (1,7), (1,8).\n    - Immediate gratification.\n    - Risk: (1,6) is close to the left wall. (0,6) is a possible retreat, but (0,7) leads to (0,8) which is 'T' (Enemy tail? or just empty? Map shows row 8 col 0 is '.'). Wait, map row 8: `8 . A . . . . . T . .`. Col 0 is '.'.\n    - If I go UP, I am climbing the left wall.\n    - If I eat (1,7), I grow. The path (1,6) -> (1,7) -> (1,8) is clear.\n    - However, (1,8) is at the top. (1,9) is wall. (0,8) is 'T' (Enemy tail? Map shows (0,8) is 'T'? No, Map row 8 col 0 is '.'). Map row 8 col 7 is 'T'.\n    - Let's look at map row 9: `9 . . . . . A . 0 . .`. Col 0 is '.'.\n    - So (0,9) is empty.\n    - If I go to (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), I am cornered at the top left.\n    - From (1,8), I can go to (0,8) (empty) or (2,8) (empty). (1,9) is wall.\n    - If I eat (1,8), I grow.\n    - Is there a trap? The enemy is at (6,9). They are far.\n\n- **DOWN (1,4):**\n    - Target: Apples at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\n    - Path: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n    - (3,2) is an apple.\n    - (4,2) is an apple.\n    - (5,2) is an apple.\n    - This cluster is very attractive. 3 apples close together.\n    - The path (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is all '.' on the map (check map: Row 4 col 2 is '.', Row 3 col 2 is 'A'. Row 3 col 3 is '.').\n    - This direction seems safer and offers more growth potential (3 apples vs 2 apples).\n    - Also, moving DOWN moves me towards the center and away from the wall.\n\n- **Comparison:**\n    - UP gets 2 apples ((1,7), (1,8)) but leads to a corner.\n    - DOWN gets 3 apples ((3,2), (4,2), (5,2)) and keeps options open.\n    - The DOWN path is also safer because it's in the open board.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nMove DOWN to (1,4) to head towards the apple cluster at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). This is a better long-term strategy than chasing the two apples on the left wall.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1,4). Next turn, move to (2,4) or (1,3) to position for (3,2). Monitor enemy snake #0 at (6,9).\n\n**DOWN**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body is [(1,5)].\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Based on the text description (which is usually authoritative over the ASCII art), the Enemy Head is at (6,9) and Body is at (7,9).\n    - *Discrepancy Note:* The ASCII map shows an '0' at (7,9) and 'T' at (7,8). However, if the enemy head is at (6,9), then (7,9) is the body. The 'T' at (7,8) is confusing. If the enemy is at (6,9) and (7,9), then (7,8) is empty. I will trust the text coordinates (Head 6,9, Body 7,9) as they are explicitly listed.\n    - Enemy Head is currently at (6,9). Distance to me is significant (Manhattan distance ~7). They are not an immediate threat for collision in the next move or two.\n- **Board:** 10x10.\n- **Apples:** Several apples are scattered. The most notable cluster is at **(3,2), (4,2), (5,2)**. There are also apples at (1,7) and (1,8) (vertical line up), but these are on the wall edge.\n\n**2. Option Evaluation (From Head (1,4)):**\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (1,5)**\n    *   **Safety:** My body is currently at (1,5). Moving UP puts my head directly into my own body.\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death.\n    *   **Verdict:** **INVALID.**\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (0,4)**\n    *   **Safety:** (0,4) is on the wall boundary. Map shows '.'.\n    *   **Body:** My body is at (1,5). (0,4) is not occupied by my body.\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is far away at (6,9).\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   If I move to (0,4), I am on the left wall.\n        *   To reach the main apple cluster (3,2), I would need to go (0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n        *   This is a long detour.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but restricts movement and delays access to the best apples.\n\n*   **Option 3: RIGHT to (2,4)**\n    *   **Safety:** (2,4) is '.'.\n    *   **Body:** (1,5) is the only body part. (2,4) is safe.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   This moves me into the center of the board.\n        *   From (2,4), I can access the apple cluster at (3,2) very quickly: (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n        *   (3,2) is an apple. (4,2) is an apple. (5,2) is an apple.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Strong Contender.** Opens up the board and targets the densest apple cluster.\n\n*   **Option 4: DOWN to (1,3)**\n    *   **Safety:** (1,3) is '.'.\n    *   **Body:** Safe.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   From (1,3), I can go to (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2).\n        *   This is also a good path to the apple cluster.\n        *   However, (1,3) is slightly closer to the wall than (2,4).\n    *   **Verdict:** Good, but RIGHT (2,4) keeps me more centered.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nThe apple cluster at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) represents 3 apples. Moving **RIGHT** to (2,4) is the best way to position myself to grab these apples efficiently.\n- From (2,4), the path (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is clear.\n- Moving to (2,4) also avoids the wall at (0,4) and the self-collision at (1,5).\n- The enemy snake is at (6,9) and poses no immediate threat. I should focus on maximizing my score by eating the cluster.\n\n**Move Choice:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (2,4).\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (2,4).\n2. Next turn, move to (3,4) (or (2,3) if needed, but (3,4) is closer to the cluster).\n3. Secure the apples at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\n\n**RIGHT**",

The vertical line at **(1, 7), (1, 8)** is also a target but is currently occupied by the enemy's tail (Snake #0 is at 5,8 and 5,9, so 1,7 and 1,8 are likely safe apples for now, but far away).\n\n**2. Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Located at (5, 7). He is moving this turn. His likely moves are DOWN to (5, 6) or RIGHT to (6, 7) towards the apples at (6,6), (7,5), etc. He is not an immediate collision threat to my head at (3, 4).\n*   **Self-Collision:** My body is at (2, 4). My head is at (3, 4).\n*   **Board Boundaries:** I am at x=3, so x=0 is reachable. Y=9 is the top wall.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (3, 4)):**\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (3, 5)**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 5) is currently empty ('.').\n    *   **Body:** My body is at (2, 4). (3, 5) is safe.\n    *   **Pathing:** Moves me closer to the top wall and away from the bottom apple cluster.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Discard.** It moves me away from the densest apples.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (3, 3)**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 3) is currently empty ('.').\n    *   **Body:** (2, 4) is safe.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   This moves me closer to the apple at (3, 2).\n        *   Next turn (Turn 8), I can move DOWN to (3, 2) to eat the apple and grow.\n        *   From (3, 2), I can pivot to (4, 2) or (5, 2) for the next apple.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Good candidate.** This is the planned path from the previous turn's rationale.\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (2, 4)**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 4) is occupied by my own body.\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death.\n    *   **Verdict:** **INVALID.**\n\n*   **Option 4: RIGHT to (4, 4)**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 4) is currently empty ('.').\n    *   **Body:** (2, 4) is safe.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   This moves me east, parallel to the apple cluster but slightly above it.\n        *   From (4, 4), I can move DOWN to (4, 3) and then (4, 2) (Apple).\n        *   This opens up the board significantly. From (4, 4), I can also pivot to (5, 4).\n    *   **Verdict:** **Alternative candidate.** It offers flexibility.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI must choose between **DOWN to (3, 3)** and **RIGHT to (4, 4)**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Down (3, 3):**\n    *   Keeps me on the direct path to the apple at (3, 2).\n    *   However, looking at the board state, (2, 3) and (4, 3) are empty. Moving to (3, 3) commits me to the x=3 column for at least one more turn.\n    *   The apple at (3, 2) is immediately below. Eating it on Turn 8 is safe (no other snake is close enough to contest it on Turn 8).\n    *   *Self-Correction/Deep Thought:* Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt again:\n        ```\n         9 . . . . . T . . . .\n         8 . A . . . T . . . .\n         7 . A . . . 0 . . . .\n         6 . . . . . . . A . A\n         5 . . . . . . A A . .\n         4 . . T 1 . . . . . .\n         3 . . . . A . .

The apple at (3, 2) is \"down\".\n        However, the apple at (4, 2) is \"down-right\".\n        If I go DOWN to (3, 3), I am getting closer to (3, 2).\n        If I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am getting closer to (4, 2) and (5, 2).\n\n*   **Comparison of Targets:**\n    *   **Path Down (3, 3) -> (3, 2):**\n        *   Eat (3, 2). Then I am at (3, 2).\n        *   From (3, 2), I can go to (4, 2) (Apple).\n        *   From (4, 2), I can go to (5, 2) (Apple).\n        *   This path is a straight line down, then a zig-zag.\n    *   **Path Right (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2):**\n        *   Eat (4, 2). Then I am at (4, 2).\n        *   From (4, 2), I can go to (5, 2) (Apple) or (3, 2) (Apple).\n        *   This path approaches the cluster from the side.\n\n*   **Enemy Position Check:**\n    *   Enemy is at (5, 7).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3, 3), I am safe.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am safe.\n\n*   **Flexibility:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT to (4, 4)** gives me more options. I can turn down to (4, 3), then (4, 2), OR turn down to (5, 3), then (5, 2).\n    *   Moving **DOWN to (3, 3)** locks my x-coordinate to 3 for the immediate next move (unless I turn left to (2, 3) or right to (4, 3)).\n    *   However, (2, 3) is closer to the left edge (x=0). (4, 4) is more central to the board's open space.\n\n*   **Final Decision Logic:**\n    *   The goal is to reach the apple cluster safely.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 4)** is slightly better because it keeps me centered horizontally relative to the cluster (which spans x=3, 4, 5).\n    *   From (4, 4), I have a clear path down to (4, 2) or (5, 2).\n    *   From (3, 3), my path is slightly more constrained to the left side of the cluster.\n    *   Also, looking at the \"Board state\" text, the apple at (4, 2) is listed as `A`, and (3, 2) is `A`.\n    *   Moving RIGHT aligns me with the \"right\" side of the cluster, which is often safer because it avoids running into the edge of the board if I need to spiral later.\n    *   Additionally, moving RIGHT avoids potential collisions if the enemy decides to move aggressively towards the center, though unlikely from (5,7).\n\n    *Wait, let me check the coordinates again.*\n    Head at (3, 4).\n    Down -> (3, 3). Next move Down -> (3, 2) (Apple). Growth +1.\n    Right -> (4, 4). Next move Down -> (4, 3). Next move Down -> (4, 2) (Apple). Growth +1.\n    \n    The apple at (3, 2) is directly accessible. The apple at (4, 2) is also accessible.\n    However, the apple at (5, 2) is the furthest right of the cluster.\n    If I go **RIGHT** now, I am equidistant to (4, 2) and (5, 2).\n    If I go **DOWN**, I am closest to (3, 2).\n    \n    Is there a danger in (3, 3)? The board shows (3, 3) is empty.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the \"Right\" move.\n    From (3, 4) to (4, 4).\n    Is there any wall blocking me? No.\n    Is there any snake blocking me? No.\n    Is there any immediate benefit to going Down?\n    Going Down gets me an apple 1 turn sooner (Turn 8 vs Turn 9).\n    But going Right might offer better positioning for the *next* apple (4,2 or 5,2).\n    \n    Let's look at the board geometry again.\n    Cluster:\n    (3, 2) A\n    (4, 2) A\n    (5, 2) A\n    \n    My head (3, 4).\n    If I go DOWN to (3, 3):\n    Next turn I go to (3, 2). Eat.\n    Now I am at (3, 2). My tail is at (1, 4).\n    I can then go to (4, 2).\n    \n    If I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\n    Next turn I go to (4, 3).\n    Turn after I go to (4, 2). Eat.\n    Now I am at (4, 2).\n    I can then go to (5, 2).\n    \n    The time to get the *first* apple is faster if I go DOWN.\n    However, the prompt asks to \"outwit him and outlast him\".\n    The enemy is at (5, 7). He is likely moving towards (5, 6) or (6, 6).\n    He is not going for the bottom cluster (y=2).\n    \n    So the bottom cluster is safe for me.\n    Getting the first apple faster (DOWN) allows me to grow and reach the next apple faster.\n    Therefore, **DOWN** is actually the better move to maximize apple intake speed.\n    \n    Let me verify the safety of (3, 3).\n    (3, 3) is empty.\n    My body (2, 4) is not at (3, 3).\n    Enemy body is at (5,8), (5,9). Enemy head is at (5,7).\n    Enemy will move. Even if he moves DOWN, he goes to (5,6). (3, 3) is far away.\n    \n    So, **DOWN** is safe and gets me closer to the apple faster.\n    \n    Why did I hesitate? Because \"Right\" seemed more flexible.\n    But \"Down\" is a direct path to food.\n    In Snake, food is growth. Growth is survival.\n    Since the enemy is not contesting this food, speed to food is efficiency.\n    \n    Let's re-read the previous turn's rationale.\n    \"Turn 7: Move DOWN to (3, 3). Turn 8: Move DOWN to (3, 2) (Apple).\"\n    The previous turn's plan was to go DOWN.\n    I should stick to the plan unless the situation has changed.\n    The situation has not changed. The enemy is still far away.\n    \n    Therefore, I will continue the plan to go DOWN.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (3, 3). This is the most efficient path to the apple at (3, 2). The enemy is not a threat on this vector.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\n1. **Turn 7:** Move DOWN to (3, 3).\n2. **Turn 8:** Move DOWN to (3, 2) to eat the apple.\n3. **Turn 9:** Move to (4, 2) (Apple) or (5, 2) (Apple) depending on availability.\n4.

Option Evaluation (From Head (3, 4)):**\n\n*   **UP (3, 5):** Empty. Safe. But moves away from the apple cluster. Suboptimal.\n*   **DOWN (3, 3):** Empty. Safe. Moves closer to the apple at (3, 2). This is the planned path.\n*   **LEFT (2, 4):** Occupied by my own body. **DEADLY.**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 4):** Empty. Safe. Moves laterally.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI am at (3, 4). The apple at (3, 2) is two moves directly south.\nThe apple at (4, 2) is diagonal and slightly further.\nTo maximize growth and secure territory, the most efficient path is straight to (3, 2).\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 3) puts me in position to eat the apple at (3, 2) on the next turn (Turn 9).\n*   If I move DOWN now (Turn 8): Head (3, 3).\n*   Next turn (Turn 9): Head (3, 2). Eat apple. Grow.\n\nThis path is safe from the enemy (who is at y=6) and safe from my own body.\nI will continue the plan to move DOWN.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 8:** Move DOWN to (3, 3).\n2.  **Turn 9:** Move DOWN to (3, 2) to eat the apple.\n3.  **Turn 10:** Pivot to (4, 2) or (5, 2) to eat the next apple in the cluster.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **Enemy Prediction (Simultaneous Move):**\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 6) with a body trailing left to (6, 6) and down to (5, 6).\n    *   The enemy likely wants the apple at (6, 5) (marked 'A' on the board) or the apple at (9, 5).\n    *   If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 6), his tail moves from (5, 7) to (5, 6).\n    *   If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (7, 5), he risks colliding with the apple cluster or potentially moving towards me later.\n    *   **Prediction:** The apple at (6, 5) is directly adjacent to his head at (7, 6). He will likely attempt to move **LEFT** or **DOWN** to eat it. Moving LEFT to (6, 6) is safe for him (his own body is at (6, 6), but it will move by the time he arrives if he moves). Actually, looking at the board, (6, 6) is marked 'T' (tail?), but the prompt says his head is (7, 6). Wait, let's re-read the board state.\n\n**3. Board State Review:**\n*   Row 6: `. . . . . T T 0 .

Safe.\n*   If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (7, 5), he finds an apple. Safe.\n*   **Collision Risk:**\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (5, 2), the enemy moves to (6, 6) or (7, 5). No collision.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (4, 3), the enemy moves to (6, 6). No collision.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (4, 1), the enemy moves to (6, 6). No collision.\n\n**4. Option Evaluation (From Head (4, 2)):**\n\n*   **LEFT (3, 2):** Occupied by my own body (specifically the segment immediately behind me). **DEADLY.**\n*   **UP (4, 3):** Empty. Contains an apple. Safe.\n*   **DOWN (4, 1):** Empty. Safe. Moves closer to the edge of the board (y=0).\n*   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Empty. Contains an apple. Safe.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Target Selection:**\n    *   **(5, 2)** is to my RIGHT.\n    *   **(4, 3)** is UP.\n*   **Risk Analysis:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) allows me to eat an apple and grow. This keeps me in the \"lower\" part of the board (y=2), which is currently safer and has more apples (8,1; 9,1; 6,1; 4,0; 7,3).\n    *   Moving UP to (4, 3) moves me towards the \"middle\" of the board where my body (x=3, y=3,4) is located. While (4, 3) is currently open, moving UP might restrict my movement later because I am moving closer to my own vertical body column at x=3.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 1) is safe but moves away from the immediate apple at (5, 2).\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Eating apples is the priority to win the score game.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (5, 2) is the strongest move. It secures an apple, keeps my x-coordinate > 3 (avoiding immediate self-collision), and keeps me in a low-risk area of the map.\n    *   **UP** to (4, 3) is the second best, but risks boxing me in against my own body later if I need to loop back.\n    *   **DOWN** to (4, 1) is safe but passive.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 10:** Move RIGHT to (5, 2) to eat the apple.\n2.  **Turn 11:** Assess options from (5, 2). Likely targets will be (6, 1) or (7, 3) or (4, 0).\n3.  Monitor enemy snake (ID 0). He is eating apples at (6, 5) or (9, 5). I need to keep my score competitive.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State & Interpretation:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (5, 2) (Previous move: RIGHT from (4, 2)).\n    *   **Body:** [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)].\n    *   **Apples:** 5 (Ate apple at (5, 2)).\n    *   **Notes:** My body is anchored at x=3. I am at x=5.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (6, 5) (Previous move: DOWN-LEFT or similar from (7, 5)).\n    *   **Body:** [(7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)] (Tail at (5, 6)).\n    *   **Notes:** The enemy ate the apple at (6, 5). He is now much closer to my position.\n*   **Apples Available:**\n    *   **(6, 1):** DOWN and RIGHT (diagonal). 2 steps away? No, from (5, 2), (6, 1) is DOWN-RIGHT (x+1, y-1). It is adjacent? No, (6, 1) is x=6, y=1. I am x=5, y=2. Distance is 1 Manhattan.\n    *   **(7, 3):** UP-RIGHT. (x+2, y+1).\n    *   **(4, 0):** DOWN-LEFT. (x-1, y-2).\n    *   **(6, 5):** Eaten by enemy.\n    *   **(4, 3):** Still there (UP).\n\n**2. Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **LEFT (4, 2):** Occupied by my body (segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **UP (5, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n*   **Enemy Prediction (Simultaneous Move):**\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (6, 5).\n    *   **My Head:** (5, 2).\n    *   **Distance:** Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |5-2| = 4. Not an immediate head-on collision threat this turn, *unless* the enemy moves aggressively towards me and I move towards him. However, the board is open.\n    *   **Enemy Moves:**\n        *   The enemy is in the cluster of apples/tails. He has just eaten at (6, 5).\n        *   He might chase other apples: (9, 5), (8, 8), (1, 8) are far. (7, 3) is closer.\n        *   However, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n            *   Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n            *   Row 6: `. . . . . T T . . A`\n            *   Row 7: `. . . T . T . . . .`\n        *   Wait, the prompt says Enemy Head is (7, 5) in the text, but the board state (generated just now) shows `0` at (7, 5)? No, re-reading the prompt provided by the user: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5), Body: [(7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)], Apples: 4\".\n        *   *Correction*: The prompt text says Head is (7, 5). But the board visual says `0` is at (7, 5)? Let's look at the board visual again.\n            *   Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n            *   Indices 0-9. At index 7 (x=7), the character is `0`.\n            *   This implies the enemy head is at (7, 5).\n            *   Wait, the user text says \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5)\".\n            *   Okay, the enemy did not move. He is still at (7, 5). The previous turn analysis (from the user) said he moved. But the current state says (7, 5).\n            *   Let's re-verify the board state provided in the *current* prompt.\n                *   Row 6: `. . . . . T T 0 . A` -> This is (5,6)=T, (6,6)=T, (7,6)=0?\n                *   Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 . A` -> This is (6,5)=A, (7,5)=0.\n                *   Wait, the board visual has a conflict or I am misinterpreting.\n                *   Let's look strictly at the text: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #0 - Head: (7, 5)\".\n                *   Let's look at the board: \"Row 5: ... 0 ...\" at x=7. \"Row 6: ... 0 ...\" at x=7? No, Row 6 says `0` at index 8? No.\n                *   Row 6: `. . . . . T T T . A` (Indices 0-9).\n                    *   (5,6)=T, (6,6)=T, (7,6)=T.\n                *   Row 5: `. . . . . . A 0 .

(5,7) is T (Row 7 has T at index 5).\n                *   This matches.\n            *   **Conclusion:** Enemy Head is at (7, 5).\n            *   **Threat:** The enemy is at (7, 5). I am at (5, 2). The gap is 3 steps horizontally and 3 steps vertically. No direct collision this turn.\n            *   However, the enemy is \"above\" me. I am in the lower open space. I should stay low to avoid him.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (5, 2)):**\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):** Occupied by my body. **DEADLY.**\n*   **UP (5, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   Moves me closer to my body at (3, 3) and (3, 4).\n    *   Moves me away from the \"safe\" lower area (y=0,1).\n    *   Not ideal.\n*   **DOWN (5, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   Moves towards the edge (y=0).\n    *   Moves closer to apple at (4, 0) and (6, 1).\n    *   Keeps me away from the enemy (who is at y=5).\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   Moves closer to apple at (6, 1) and (7, 3).\n    *   Increases x coordinate, moving away from my body at x=3.\n    *   Good option.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Stay alive, grow, stay competitive on score.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **UP (5, 3):** This moves me into the \"middle\" layer. My body is at x=3, y=3,4. If I go UP to (5,3), I am parallel to my body at y=3. This limits my ability to move left (body is at 4,2 and 3,2... actually (4,2) is my second segment). If I go UP, I am at (5,3). My body is at (4,2), (3,2)... So (4,2) is below and left.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 1):** This is very safe. It puts me at y=1, x=5. From there, I can easily access apples at (4,0), (6,1), (8,1), (9,1). It keeps me in the \"low y\" region where the enemy is not.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 2):** This is also good. It gets me closer to (6,1) and (7,3). However, (6,2) is only one step away from (7,3) and (6,1).\n    *   **Comparison of DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n        *   If I go DOWN to (5, 1), I am at y=1. The enemy is at y=5. I am effectively safe from him for several turns.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I am moving \"up\" in the sense that y=2 is higher than y=1, and I'm moving right towards the center-right.\n        *   There is an apple at (6, 1). If I go DOWN to (5, 1), I am adjacent to (6, 1). If I go RIGHT to (6, 2), I am also adjacent to (6, 1).\n        *   However, if I go DOWN, I secure the option to go to (4, 0) next turn (which is an apple). (4,0) is an apple.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, (4, 0) becomes further away.\n    *   **Apple Priority:**\n        *   (6, 1) is very close.\n        *   (4, 0) is very close.\n        *   (7, 3) is close.\n        *   (8, 1) is close.\n    *   **Safety:**\n        *   The enemy is at (7, 5). He is not threatening me if I stay at y <= 1 or 2.\n        *   However, if I go UP to (5, 3), I enter the \"mid-field\" where the enemy might eventually travel. Staying low is better.\n        *   Also, my body is at (3, 2), (3, 3). If I go UP, I am getting closer to the \"wall\" of my body on the left.\n        *   If I go DOWN or RIGHT, I increase the distance between my head and my body, keeping options open.\n\n*   **Final Choice:**\n    *   **UP** is risky because it brings me closer to my own body and potential enemy engagement later.\n    *   **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are both safe and lead to apples.\n    *   **DOWN** to (5, 1) seems the most conservative and safest play. It places me in the bottom row (almost) and allows access to multiple low-lying apples ((4,0), (6,1), (8,1), (9,1)). It also moves me away from the enemy's y-level (5).\n    *   **RIGHT** to (6, 2) is also good, but it leaves me at y=2, slightly more exposed than y=1, and further from (4,0).\n    *   Comparing (5, 1) and (6, 2):\n        *   From (5, 1): Can reach (4,0) [Left-Down], (6,1) [Right], (8,1) [Right-Right].\n        *   From (6, 2): Can reach (6, 1) [Down], (7, 3) [Up-Right], (8, 1) [Right-Down].\n    *   (5, 1) seems to offer a slightly better \"hub\" position for the low-y apples.\n    *   Also, moving DOWN increases the distance from the enemy's current y=5 to my y=1. This is good for avoiding collision later.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 11:** Move DOWN to (5, 1) to secure a low position and open paths to (4,0) and (6,1).\n2.  **Turn 12:** Target apple at (4, 0) or (6, 1).\n3.  **Enemy Watch:** Keep the enemy at y=5 in my peripheral vision. Stay low.\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **LEFT (4, 1):** Empty.\n    *   **UP (5, 2):** Occupied by my own body (segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN (5, 0):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Empty.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   The enemy is at (6, 5). He is likely to move towards available apples (e.g., (9, 5), (8, 8), etc.) or just wander. He is not currently positioned to threaten me in the bottom-left quadrant where I am heading.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (5, 1)):**\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** Moves me closer to apple at (4, 0) (Down-Left). Also closer to (0, 1).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me away from my body at (5, 2) and (4, 2). This is good for maneuverability.\n    *   **Pros:** Opens the path to the bottom-left corner apples.\n\n*   **UP (5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**. My body occupies (5, 2). Moving here kills me.\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n*   **DOWN (5, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No immediate apple at (5, 0). (4, 0) is Left-Down. (6, 0) is Right-Down (no apple).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me to the bottom wall. Limits vertical mobility.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but not as good as LEFT because I want to go to (4, 0) eventually. Moving DOWN now forces a turn later to get to (4, 0).\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** **Immediate apple at (6, 1)**. Eating this grows me immediately.\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me closer to the center-right.\n    *   **Pros:** Immediate growth. Secures points.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves me slightly away from the (4, 0) apple cluster, though (4, 0) is still reachable via (5, 0) -> (4, 0) or (6, 1) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0). However, (6, 1) is an immediate win.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nComparing **LEFT (4, 1)** vs **RIGHT (6, 1)**:\n*   **RIGHT (6, 1)** provides an **immediate apple**. This is usually the priority unless the move is unsafe or leads to immediate death. Eating apples increases score and length, which is the objective.\n*   **LEFT (4, 1)** positions me for a future apple at (4, 0) but does not grant an apple this turn.\n*   **Safety:** Both moves are safe from self-collision. Both are safe from the enemy (Enemy at y=5, me at y=1).\n*   **Future Options:**\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 1) (eating apple): My body becomes [(6, 1), (5, 1), ...]. Next turn, I can go to (7, 1), (6, 0), or (6, 2). (6, 0) is safe. (7, 1) is near apple (8, 1). (6, 2) is safe. Good options.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (4, 1) (no apple): My body is [(4, 1), (5, 1), ...]. Next turn, I can go to (4, 0) (Apple!), (3, 1), or (4, 2) (Body). (4, 0) is the target.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe apple at (6, 1) is right there. It is the safest and most productive move. The apple at (4, 0) is also very close and will likely still be there next turn (unless the enemy does a miracle teleport, which he won't). Securing the point immediately is the best play.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 12:** Move RIGHT to (6, 1) to eat the apple. This grows my snake and secures a point.\n2.  **Turn 13:** From (6, 1), I can target (8, 1) or (4, 0) depending on the board state. (8, 1) is reachable.\n3.  **Enemy Watch:** Continue to monitor enemy at (6, 5). Keep distance.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT\n**END TURN 12 ANALYSIS**\n**END RATIONALE**",

Current State & Interpretation:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (6, 1) (Previous move: RIGHT from (5, 1)). **Apple eaten at (6, 1).**\n    *   **Body:** [(5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)].\n    *   **Apples:** 6 (Grew from 5).\n    *   **Notes:** I am at (6, 1). I have eaten the immediate apple. My body is still mostly in the center-left area.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (6, 4).\n    *   **Body:** [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)].\n    *   **Notes:** Enemy is still at (6, 4), y=4. He is vertically aligned with me (x=6) but 3 units away. This is a potential vertical threat if he moves down, but currently safe.\n*   **Apples Available (Relevant to my position at (6, 1)):**\n    *   **(7, 1):** RIGHT. Empty.\n    *   **(8, 1):** RIGHT-RIGHT. Apple.\n    *   **(6, 0):** DOWN. Empty.\n    *   **(5, 0):** LEFT-DOWN. Empty.\n    *   **(4, 0):** LEFT-LEFT-DOWN. Apple.\n    *   **(6, 2):** UP. Empty.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **LEFT (5, 1):** Occupied by my body (segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **UP (6, 2):** Empty.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 0):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 1):** Empty.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy is at (6, 4). If he moves DOWN to (6, 3) this turn, and I move UP to (6, 2), we will be 1 square apart. If I move UP again next turn to (6, 3), we collide (assuming he stayed or moved there). However, if I move UP to (6, 2), my tail will move from (3, 3) to (3, 2), opening up space. The enemy is currently 3 squares away vertically.\n    *   **Immediate Head-on Collision Check:**\n        *   If I move UP to (6, 2), Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3): No collision.\n        *   If I move UP to (6, 2), Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 2): Collision. (Highly unlikely, but possible).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (6, 0), Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3): Safe.\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 1), Enemy moves DOWN to (6, 3): Safe.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (6, 1)):**\n\n*   **UP (6, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from self. Potentially dangerous if Enemy moves aggressively down, but currently safe distance.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple at (6, 2).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me closer to the center. However, it points me directly toward the Enemy at (6, 4). This creates a \"corridor\" where we might race or block each other.\n    *   **Verdict:** High risk of future entrapment or collision. I should avoid moving directly toward the enemy unless I have a distinct advantage (like being much longer, which we are not - we are equal length 5 vs 5 body segments).\n\n*   **DOWN (6, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple at (6, 0).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me to the bottom wall (y=0). This limits movement to Left/Right along the bottom.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe, but restrictive. It doesn't lead to an immediate apple.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple at (7, 1).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me horizontally away from my body and toward the right side.\n    *   **Pros:** Opens path to (8, 1) apple next turn.\n    *   **Cons:** None immediate. Moving away from the cluster of apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0).\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY**. Occupied by my own body.\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nMy goal is to outlast the enemy and maximize apples.\n*   **Avoiding the Enemy:** The enemy is vertically aligned at (6, 4). Moving UP (6, 2) brings me closer to him. While not immediately fatal, it reduces the safety buffer. I should prefer moves that disengage from the vertical axis.\n*   **Chasing Apples:** The apple at (8, 1) is two steps to the right. The apple at (4, 0) is three steps left and down.\n    *   To reach (8, 1), I need to move RIGHT to (7, 1) first.\n    *   To reach (4, 0), I need to move LEFT (illegal) or DOWN to (6, 0) then LEFT to (5, 0) then LEFT to (4, 0).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 1):** Sets me up for (8, 1) next turn. Moves me away from the enemy (distance increases to ~5 Manhattan).\n    *   **DOWN (6, 0):** Sets me up for (5, 0) or (4, 0). Moves me to the wall. Stays on the enemy's vertical axis (x=6).\n*   **Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT to (7, 1) is the best move. It prepares for an immediate apple at (8, 1) next turn, increases distance from the enemy, and keeps me in the open central area rather than bottling myself at the bottom wall. It also leaves the bottom-left apples accessible for later (I can loop back down via (7, 0) -> (6, 0) etc. if needed).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 13:** Move RIGHT to (7, 1).\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move RIGHT to (8, 1) to eat the apple.\n3.  **Enemy Watch:** Maintain distance. The enemy is currently on my x-axis but 3-4 units away. Moving right is safe.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State & Interpretation:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (7, 1) (Previous move: RIGHT from (6, 1)). **Apple eaten at (6, 1).**\n    *   **Body:** [(6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)].\n    *   **Apples:** 6.\n    *   **Notes:** I am at (7, 1). The apple I planned to eat at (8, 1) is still there.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (7, 4).\n    *   **Body:** [(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6)].\n    *   **Notes:** Enemy moved from (6, 4) to (7, 4). He is now at x=7, y=4. We are on the same vertical line (x=7). He is 3 units above me (y=4 vs y=1).\n*   **Apples Available (Relevant to my position at (7, 1)):**\n    *   **(8, 1):** RIGHT. **Apple.**\n    *   **(7, 0):** DOWN. Empty.\n    *   **(6, 1):** LEFT. My tail (occupied).\n    *   **(7, 2):** UP. Empty.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **LEFT (6, 1):** Occupied by my body (segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **UP (7, 2):** Empty.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 0):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 1):** Apple (Empty space).\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   **Direct Collision:**\n        *   If I move UP to (7, 2) and Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3): Safe.\n        *   If I move UP to (7, 2) and Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 2): **Collision.**\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (8, 1) and Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3): Safe.\n    *   **Future Threat Analysis:**\n        *   **If I move UP (7, 2):** I get closer to the enemy (distance 2). If the enemy continues down to (7, 3) next turn, I will be trapped in a dangerous vertical squeeze. If I move UP again to (7, 3), I die (head-on collision). If I move RIGHT to (8, 3), I am safe for a moment but the enemy is very close. The geometry of moving UP creates a \"corridor\" where the enemy can easily cut me off or force a collision.\n        *   **If I move RIGHT (8, 1):** I move to an apple. The distance to the enemy increases (Manhattan distance becomes 4). More importantly, I move *off* the vertical line x=7 that the enemy currently occupies. This forces the enemy to chase me or maintain position. If I am at (8, 1), the enemy at (7, 4) cannot directly kill me next turn unless he moves to (8, 4) (unlikely) or (7, 3) (doesn't hit me). This move maximizes my safety buffer.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (7, 1)):**\n\n*   **UP (7, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from self. High risk of future collision with enemy on the same x-axis.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple.\n    *   **Geometry:** Directly toward the enemy.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Avoid.** Engaging the enemy vertically when we are equal length is dangerous. I need space, not a bottleneck.\n\n*   **DOWN (7, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple.\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves to bottom wall. Restricts future movement.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Suboptimal.** While safe now, it limits my ability to navigate the board and reach other apples.\n\n*   **RIGHT (8, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** **Apple.** Immediate point gain.\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves away from the enemy (distance 4) and off the vertical axis. Keeps me in the open area (y=1).\n    *   **Verdict:** **Best.** Secures a point, creates distance, and avoids entrapment.\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY** (Body).\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI have an opportunity to eat an apple immediately at (8, 1).\n*   **Option 1: Eat the apple (RIGHT).** This grows my snake, increases my score, and moves me away from the enemy's current position. It places me at (8, 1), where I have future options (Right to (9,1) which is an apple, Down to (8,0) which is an apple, Up to (8,2)).\n*   **Option 2: Avoid the apple (UP/DOWN).** This preserves the apple for later but puts me closer to the enemy (UP) or in a corner (DOWN).\n*   **Comparison:** Eating the apple is strictly better. It is a guaranteed point. The enemy is at (7, 4); moving to (8, 1) does not put me in immediate danger, and actually increases the Manhattan distance compared to moving UP. The enemy would have to move aggressively to threaten me next turn, whereas moving UP brings me into his immediate striking range.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 14:** Move RIGHT to (8, 1) to eat the apple.\n2.  **Turn 15:** Evaluate the board. Likely targets will be (9, 1) or (8, 0) or (9, 3), depending on enemy movement. I will likely need to turn up or down to avoid the wall at x=9.\n3.  **Enemy Watch:** Maintain distance. I am moving away from him.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State & Interpretation:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** (8, 0) (Previous move: DOWN from (8, 1)). **Apple eaten at (8, 0).**\n    *   **Body:** [(8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)].\n    *   **Apples:** 8 (Previous 7 + 1).\n    *   **Notes:** I successfully moved to the bottom edge, eating the apple at (8, 0). My tail will not grow immediately since I didn't eat this turn (wait, I did eat at (8, 0) on the previous turn. The body shown is the state *after* the move. The tail is at (3, 2)).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (8, 3).\n    *   **Body:** [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)].\n    *   **Notes:** The enemy moved from (7, 3) to (8, 3). He is now directly above me at (8, 0), separated by (8, 1) (my body) and (8, 2) (empty). He is trying to close the distance.\n*   **Apples Available (From Head (8, 0)):**\n    *   **(9, 0):** RIGHT. **Apple.**\n    *   **(7, 0):** LEFT. Empty.\n    *   **(8, 1):** UP. My body (occupied).\n    *   **(8, -1):** DOWN. Out of bounds.\n\n**2. Threat Assessment:**\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   **UP (8, 1):** Occupied by my body (segment 1). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN (8, -1):** Off board. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **LEFT (7, 0):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 0):** Apple (Empty space).\n*   **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   The enemy is at (8, 3). If he moves DOWN to (8, 2), he will be adjacent to my body at (8, 1). If I stay at (8, 0), I am safe from immediate collision, but my escape route is limited.\n    *   **Head-on Collision:** If I move UP (impossible, body) or DOWN (impossible, wall), I die. If I move LEFT (7, 0) or RIGHT (9, 0), the enemy would need to be at (7, 0) or (9, 0) to kill me. He is at (8, 3). He cannot reach (7, 0) or (9, 0) in one move.\n    *   **Future Threat:**\n        *   **Geometry:** I am pinned against the bottom wall at (8, 0). My only safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n        *   **If I move RIGHT (9, 0):** I eat an apple. Next turn, I can only go UP (9, 1) or LEFT (8, 0). (8, 0) will be empty (I leave it). (9, 1) is an apple. This puts me back on the right wall, which is a dangerous bottleneck.\n        *   **If I move LEFT (7, 0):** No apple. Next turn, I can go UP (7, 1), RIGHT (8, 0), or LEFT (6, 0). (7, 1) is my body (deadly). (8, 0) is empty. (6, 0) is empty. This opens up the bottom row for sweeping.\n\n**3. Option Evaluation (From Head (8, 0)):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** **Apple.** Immediate point gain (9 total).\n    *   **Geometry:** Hits the wall. Restricts future movement to UP or LEFT.\n    *   **Verdict:** High immediate reward, but traps me against the wall again.\n\n*   **LEFT (7, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple.\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me away from the wall. Opens up the bottom row (can go to 6,0 next turn).\n    *   **Verdict:** Strategic. Increases mobility and keeps me away from the enemy at (8, 3).\n\n*   **UP (8, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY** (Body).\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n*   **DOWN (8, -1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY** (Wall).\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI have two choices: eat the apple at (9, 0) and risk getting pinned against the wall, or move to (7, 0) to maintain mobility and safety.\n*   **Option 1: Eat (9, 0).** Score increases to 9. However, I will be at (9, 0) with only UP or LEFT as moves. UP leads to (9, 1) (Apple), LEFT leads to (8, 0) (Empty). If I go UP to (9, 1), I am still on the wall. The enemy at (8, 3) can easily cut me off if he moves to (8, 2) or (9, 2). Being on the wall limits my ability to dodge.\n*   **Option 2: Move to (7, 0).** Score remains 8. I gain access to (6, 0) and (7, 1) (though 7,1 is my body, I can eventually wrap around). This keeps me mobile at the bottom of the board, far from the enemy's current position. It allows me to sweep the bottom edge for apples (like (6,0), (5,0), etc.) which are currently unguarded.\n*   **Comparison:** While eating an apple is always tempting, survival and positioning are paramount. The enemy is at (8, 3) and moving down. If I am at (9, 0), I am in a corner. If I am at (7, 0), I have room to maneuver. **Option 2 is safer and strategically superior.**\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Turn 16:** Move LEFT to (7, 0).\n2.  **Turn 17:** Move LEFT to (6, 0) (Apple).\n3.  **Enemy Watch:** Maintain distance from enemy at (8, 3). Sweep the bottom row.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

The coordinate `(5, 0)` is empty and contains an apple.\n*   **Right (7, 0):** The board shows `T` (Tail).

Option Evaluation (From Head (6, 0)):**\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. It is an apple. My body is at `(5, 1)`, which is not the target.\n    *   **Apple Potential:** **Apple.** Immediate point gain (9 total).\n    *   **Geometry:** Moves me further left along the bottom edge.\n    *   **Verdict:** Excellent. I eat an apple and continue my sweep.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 0):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. It is my tail. The tail will move away on this turn (assuming I don't eat an apple this turn, which I can't if I move right because there's no apple there).\n    *   **Apple Potential:** No apple.\n    *   **Geometry:** Retracing steps. I would be moving into a cell that will be occupied by my tail *until* I move there. Since it's the tail, it's safe to move into as the tail will shift forward.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe but suboptimal. I would not gain an apple.\n\n*   **UP (6, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY** (Body).\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n*   **DOWN (6, -1):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY** (Wall).\n    *   **Verdict:** Illegal.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\nI have two safe moves: LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple) or RIGHT to (7, 0) (Empty/Tail).\nMoving LEFT allows me to eat the apple at (5, 0). This increases my score to 9 and extends my body. Given the enemy is at (9, 5) and I am at (6, 0), the distance is significant. Eating the apple is the correct play to maximize score and keep momentum.\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 0) is safe but doesn't progress my score. It would be a defensive move if LEFT was unsafe, but LEFT is an apple and safe.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to eat the apple at (5, 0).\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's count the prompt's body: `[(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]`. That's 7 body segments. Plus Head (5, 0) makes 8 segments.\n                10. I ate an apple at (5, 0). I grow. Total segments = 9.\n                11. The body list for Turn 19 should be:\n                    1. (5, 0) [New Head]\n                    2. (6, 0) [Old Head]\n                    3.

(Old Tail is gone? No, I didn't move the tail if I ate).\n                    10. Wait, I have 8 segments. I ate. I have 9.\n                    11. The provided board state for Turn 19 shows `T` at (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1). And `T` at (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3).\n                    12. This is confusing. The board state shows many T's. Let's rely on the rule: \"Do not perform web searches... Use only the game state provided.\"\n                    13.

Let's assume I am at (4, 0) and need to choose a move for Turn 20.\n\n**Board Analysis (Turn 20):**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (4, 0) (Based on last move being LEFT from (5, 0))\n    *   Body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), ...] (Likely length 9 or 10 depending on growth).\n    *   Surroundings of (4, 0):\n        *   **LEFT (3, 0):** Empty `.`.\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 0):** Body `T` (Neck). *Self-collision*.\n        *   **UP (4, 1):** Body `T` (Attached to body at (5, 1)). *Self-collision*.\n        *   **DOWN (4, -1):** Out of bounds (Wall).\n\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (9, 6) (Based on Turn 19 info: `(9, 6)`).\n    *   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 4), ...].\n    *   Movement: Enemy is at the top-right corner.\n        *   From (9, 6), possible moves: Left (8, 6) or Down (9, 5) or Up (9, 7).\n        *   (9, 5) is body (risk of tail moving, but generally unsafe).\n        *   (8, 6) is likely safe.\n        *   (9, 7) is likely safe.\n    *   Distance from my head (4, 0) to Enemy head (9, 6) is large. No immediate collision threat.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI am at (4, 0).\n1.  **RIGHT (5, 0):** Blocked by my own body. **Unsafe**.\n2.  **UP (4, 1):** Blocked by my own body. **Unsafe**.\n3.  **DOWN:** Wall. **Unsafe**.\n4.  **LEFT (3, 0):** The only safe move. It is an open cell.\n\n**Strategic Implication:**\nI am being forced to move LEFT.\n(3, 0) is an empty space. From (3, 0), my options are:\n*   **Left (2, 0):** Empty `.`.\n*   **Right (4, 0):** My current head (will be body).\n*   **Up (3, 1):** Empty `.` (Based on board state where (3, 1) is not marked as body in the immediate vicinity of (4, 1) unless the body loop is very tight). Wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 19, row 1 shows `A . . . . T T T T A`. This suggests (1, 1) is `T`. (2, 1) is `T`. (3, 1) is `T`. (4, 1) is `T`. (5, 1) is `T`.\n*   If (3, 1) is `T` (Body), then (3, 0) is a dead end if I cannot go left.\n\nLet's re-examine the board state from the prompt for Turn 19 (which is the state I am reasoning from):\nRow 0: ` . A . . 1 T T T . .` (Indices 0-9)\nRow 1: ` A . . . . T T T T A`\nRow 2: ` . A . . . . . . . .`\nRow 3: ` . . A . A . . T T T`\n\nMy head is at (4, 0) (marked as 1).\nMy body is at (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0) (marked as T).\nMy body is also at (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1) (marked as T).\nRow 1 shows `T` at indices 5, 6, 7, 8.\nRow 1 shows `.` at index 4. (4, 1) is empty!\nWait, the prompt says \"Board state provided in prompt\" and shows `T` at (4, 1) in the rationale. But the actual grid provided in the prompt shows `.` at (4, 1).\nLet's look at the grid provided in the prompt again:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . A A . . A . . A .\n 7 A A . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . A . . . . . 0\n 5 . . . . . . T T . T\n 4 . . . . . A T T A T\n 3 . . A . A . . T T T\n 2 . A . . . . . . . .\n 1 A . . . . T T T T A\n 0 . A . . 1 T T T T .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n*   (4, 1) is at row 1, column 4. The string is `A . . . . T T T T A`. The 5th character (index 4) is `.` (empty).\n*   (3, 1) is index 3, which is `.` (empty).\n*   (2, 1) is index 2, which is `.` (empty).\n*   (1, 1) is index 1, which is `.` (empty).\n*   (0, 1) is index 0, which is `A`.\n\nSo, (4, 1) is EMPTY. (3, 1) is EMPTY. (2, 1) is EMPTY.\nThis means the \"Body\" list provided in the prompt text `[(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]` is inconsistent with the visual grid for Turn 19.\nHowever, the instructions say: \"Board state provided in prompt\" and \"Use only the game state provided\".\nThe visual grid is the most reliable representation of the board state.\nTherefore, I should trust the visual grid.\n\n**Revised Analysis with Visual Grid:**\n*   **Current Position:** (4, 0).\n*   **Visual Grid Check:**\n    *   (3, 0): `.` (Empty).\n    *   (5, 0): `T` (Body).\n    *   (4, 1): `.` (Empty).\n*   **Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 0):** Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 0):** Unsafe (Body).\n    *   **UP (4, 1):** Safe (Empty).\n    *   **DOWN:** Wall.\n\n**Choice: LEFT vs UP.**\n*   **UP (4, 1):**\n    *   (4, 1) is empty.\n    *   From (4, 1), neighbors are:\n        *   (4, 0): Current head.\n        *   (4, 2): Row 2 ` . A . . . . . . . .` -> (4, 2) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (3, 1): `.` (Empty).\n        *   (5, 1): `T` (Body). This is dangerous. If I go UP to (4, 1), I am sandwiched between (4, 0) and (5, 1). (5, 1) is body. If I later try to go Right to (5, 1), I die. If I try to go Left to (3, 1), I am safe.\n    *   (3, 1) is Empty. (3, 2) is `A`.\n    *   (4, 2) is Empty.\n    *   This path seems viable. It opens up the area (3, 1), (4, 2).\n*   **LEFT (3, 0):**\n    *   (3, 0) is empty.\n    *   From (3, 0), neighbors are:\n        *   (2, 0): Row 0 ` . A . . . T T T T .` -> (2, 0) is `.` (Empty).\n        *   (4, 0): Current head.\n        *   (3, 1): `.` (Empty).\n    *   (2, 0) is Empty.\n    *   (1, 0) is `A`.\n    *   This path leads towards the left wall.\n    *   (0, 0) is `.` (Bottom left corner).\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **UP (4, 1):** Moves into the central area. Avoids the bottom-left corner. Keeps the apple at (4, 2) in reach. Opens up (3, 1) and (4, 2).\n*   **LEFT (3, 0):** Moves towards the left wall. Closer to apple at (1, 0). Closer to corner (0, 0).\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nThe enemy is at (9, 6). I am at (4, 0). The left side is safer from the enemy.\nHowever, going too far into the corner (0,0) is risky if my body blocks the exit.\nCurrently, my body extends to (5, 0), (6, 0)...\nIf I go UP to (4, 1), I am moving away from my body chain at y=0 (x=5,6,7,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0), I am moving closer to the wall but opening up the (2,0) -> (1,0) path.\n\nLet's look at the apples.\nApples near me: (1, 0), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n(4, 2) is reachable via (4, 1) -> (4, 2).\n(1, 0) is reachable via (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0).\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 1):\nI am at (4, 1).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (4, 2) (Apple) or LEFT to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (5, 1) (Body - unsafe). DOWN to (4, 0) is safe (old head).\nIf I go UP to (4, 2) and eat the apple, I grow.\nMy body will extend.\nFrom (4, 2), I can go (3, 2) (Apple) or (4, 3) (Apple). This is a rich area.\nHowever, (4, 3) is `A`.\nWait, (4, 3) is `A`.\n(3, 2) is `A`.\n(2, 2) is `.`.\nThis looks like a good path.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0):\nI am at (3, 0).\nNext turn, I can go (2, 0) or (3, 1).\n(2, 0) is empty.\n(1, 0) is apple.\nThis path leads to (1, 0).\nFrom (1, 0), I am at x=1, y=0. Wall is at x=0. I can go UP to (1, 1) which is empty. (1, 1) is empty in the visual grid. Wait, row 1 is `A . . . . T T T T A`. (1, 1) is `.`.\nSo from (1, 0), I can go (1, 1).\nFrom (1, 1), I can go (1, 2) (`A`), (0, 1) (`A`).\nThis is also a rich area.\n\n**Which path is better?**\nPath UP: (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 3)...\nPath LEFT: (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2)...\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nEnemy is at (9, 6).\nIf I go UP, I am entering the main body of the board. The enemy might turn towards me eventually, but it's a long way.\nIf I go LEFT, I am hugging the wall. This limits my movement options (only 2 directions usually). If I get trapped, I die.\nHowever, my current body is long (8 segments). If I go LEFT, my tail might not move immediately (if I don't eat), or it will move if I eat (1, 0).\nIf I go UP, my body moves towards the center.\n\nLet's check the visual grid for safety of the UP move.\n(4, 1) is `.`.\n(3, 1) is `.`.\n(4, 2) is `.`.\n(3, 2) is `A`.\n(2, 2) is `.`.\n(1, 2) is `A`.\n(0, 2) is `.` (Row 2 ` . A . . . . . . . .` -> index 0 is `.`).\nSo the left side is actually quite open at y=2.\n\nLet's check the LEFT move.\n(3, 0) is `.`.\n(2, 0) is `.`.\n(1, 0) is `A`.\n(0, 0) is `.`.\n(1, 1) is `.`.\n(0, 1) is `A`.\nThe path (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) is good. (0, 1) is apple. But (0, 1) is on the wall. From (0, 1), I can go UP to (0, 2). (0, 2) is empty. (0, 3) is `.` (Row 3 ` . . A . A . . T T T` -> index 0 is `.`).\nThis is a safe loop along the left edge.\n\n**Comparison of Safety:**\n*   **UP Path:** (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2)...\n    *   At (4, 1), I am adjacent to (5, 1) (Body) and (4, 0) (Body). But (3, 1) and (4, 2) are open. This is a standard movement.\n*   **LEFT Path:** (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0)...\n    *   At (3, 0), I am adjacent to (4, 0) (Body) and (2, 0) (Open). (3, 1) is Open.\n    *   The risk here is the corner at (0, 0). If I get stuck at (0, 0), I die.\n    *   However, (0, 0) is empty. I can pass through it to (1, 0) -> (1, 1) or (0, 1).\n    *   If I go (0, 0) -> (0, 1) (Apple) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3)...\n    *   I can spiral up the left side.\n\n**Apple Availability:**\n*   **UP:** (4, 2), (3, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3) is empty, (2, 3) is `A`.\n*   **LEFT:** (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 3) is `A`.\n*   Both paths have apples.\n\n**Enemy Interaction:**\nThe enemy is at (9, 6).\nIf I go UP, I move closer to the center (x=4).\nIf I go LEFT, I move away from the enemy (x=3, then 2...).\nMoving away from the enemy is generally safer, especially since the enemy is leading in apples (9 vs 8).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe LEFT path offers a clear path to eat apples at (1, 0) and (0, 1) while hugging the wall, keeping me safe from the enemy in the center.\nThe UP path moves me into the open board.\nGiven the enemy is at (9, 6) and I am at (4, 0), I should secure the left side.\nThe move LEFT to (3, 0) is the first step of this path.\n\nOne detail: (3, 0) is adjacent to (3, 1). (3, 1) is empty.\nNext turn from (3, 0):\n*   LEFT to (2, 0) (Safe, Apple at 1,0).\n*   UP to (3, 1) (Safe, connects to open space).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 0) (Body).\n*   DOWN (Wall).\nOptions are good.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 1):\n*   UP to (4, 2) (Safe, Apple).\n*   LEFT to (3, 1) (Safe).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 1) (Body).\n*   DOWN to (4, 0) (Body).\nOptions are good.\n\nBoth are viable.\nHowever, moving LEFT commits me to the wall strategy.\nMoving UP commits me to the center strategy.\nThe wall strategy is often safer in Snake games because you don't have to watch your back (one less direction to die).\nWith the enemy far away, I can afford to take the safer wall path to build my length.\nI will move LEFT.\n\nWait, check the \"Last Move Rationale\" from the user.\nThe user said: \"I have exactly one legal move: **LEFT**.\"\nThat was for Turn 19 (Head at 5,0).\nNow for Turn 20 (Head at 4,0), I have TWO legal moves: LEFT and UP.\nI must choose the best one.\nIs there any trap?\n(4, 1) is empty.\n(3, 1) is empty.\n(4, 2) is empty.\n(3, 2) is Apple.\n(2, 2) is empty.\nThis area is clear.\n(3, 0) is empty.\n(2, 0) is empty.\n(1, 0) is Apple.\n(0, 0) is empty.\nThis area is also clear.\n\nLet's look at the apples list:\n`(1, 7), (9, 1), (1, 8), (4, 3), (0, 1), (8, 8), (3, 6), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (8, 4), (5, 8), (1, 0), (5, 4), (1, 2)`\nApples near me:\n(4, 3) - reachable via UP path.\n(0, 1) - reachable via LEFT path.\n(1, 0) - reachable via LEFT path.\n(1, 2) - reachable via LEFT path.\n(2, 3) - reachable via UP or LEFT.\n\nDistance to (1, 0): 3 moves (4->3->2->1).\nDistance to (0, 1): 4 moves (4->3->2->1->0 or 4->3->2->1->0? No, (4,0) to (0,1) is 5 moves Manhattan. 4+1=5.\nDistance to (4, 3): 3 moves (4->4->4->4).\nDistance to (1, 2): 5 moves (4->3->2->1->1->1? No, (4,0) to (1,2) is 3+2=5.\n\nThe apples on the left are closer or equidistant compared to the apples in the center.\nSpecifically, (1, 0) is very close.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0), I can grab (1, 0) quickly.\nIf I go UP to (4, 1), I can grab (4, 2) or (3, 2).\n(4, 2) is not in the apple list! Wait, the apple list provided in the prompt is the full list for the game.\nLet me check the list again.\nApples: `(1, 7), (9, 1), (1, 8), (4, 3), (0, 1), (8, 8), (3, 6), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (8, 4), (5, 8), (1, 0), (5, 4), (1, 2)`\n**Crucial Check:**\n(4, 2) is NOT in the apple list.\n(3, 2) is NOT in the apple list.\n(4, 3) IS in the apple list.\n(2, 3) IS in the apple list.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) (Apple).\nIf I go UP to (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) (Apple).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) (Apple).\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (Apple).\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) (Apple).\n\nThe LEFT path has immediate apples (1, 0) and (0, 1).\nThe UP path has (4, 3) which is slightly further (3 steps to head there), but (4, 3) is a single apple in that direction. (2, 3) is also available via UP path.\n\nLet's reconsider the board visual.\nRow 0: ` . A . . 1 T T T . .`\n(1, 0) is `A`.\n(4, 0) is `1`.\n(5, 0) is `T`.\n(6, 0) is `T`.\n(7, 0) is `T`.\n(8, 0) is `T`.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 0):\n(3, 0) is `.`.\n(2, 0) is `.`.\n(1, 0) is `A`.\nThis is a clear shot to an apple.\nOnce I eat (1, 0), I will be at (1, 0).\nFrom (1, 0), I can go UP to (1, 1) (which is empty).\nFrom (1, 1), I can go UP to (1, 2) (Apple) or LEFT to (0, 1) (Apple).\nThis forms a very safe loop on the left side: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3)...\nThe left wall is a safe boundary.\n\nIf I go UP to (4, 1):\nI enter the open field.\nFrom (4, 1), I can go to (4, 2).\nFrom (4, 2), I can go to (4, 3) (Apple).\nFrom (4, 3), I am at y=3.\n(4, 4) is `.` (Row 4 ` . . . . . A T T A T` -> (4,4) is `.`).\n(3, 3) is `.` (Row 3 ` . . A . A . . T T T` -> (3,3) is `.`).\nThis is also open.\nHowever, the enemy is at (9, 6).\nIf I go UP, I am moving closer to the horizontal center line (y=3, 4, 5).\nThe enemy is at y=6.\nThe enemy might move down towards the center.\nIf I stay on the left wall (x=0, 1, 2), I am safer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe LEFT move is strategically sound. It leads to an immediate apple (1,0) and secures the left edge of the board. The UP move moves me into the open board where I might encounter the enemy later or get trapped in loops. The left wall is a high-value defensive position.\n\n**Move:** LEFT",

Board State & Geometry:**\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10 (Coordinates 0-9).\n*   **My Position (Snake 1):** Head at (3, 0).\n*   **My Body:** [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)].\n*   **Enemy (Snake 0):** Head at (8, 6), Body at (9, 6)...(6, 5). He is far away in the top-right quadrant.\n*   **Apples:** (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7), (0, 1), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (4, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (8, 8), (8, 4), (9, 1), (3, 6), (1, 8).\n\n**2. Evaluation of Available Moves:**\nI am at (3, 0). My previous move was LEFT, bringing me here from (4, 0).\n\n*   **RIGHT (4, 0):**\n    *   Target cell (4, 0) is currently occupied by my body (neck).\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death. **Unsafe.**\n\n*   **DOWN:**\n    *   Y-coordinate is 0. Moving down would be Y = -1.\n    *   **Result:** Out of bounds. Immediate death. **Unsafe.**\n\n*   **UP (3, 1):**\n    *   Visual check: Row 1 is `A . . . . T T T T A`. At x=3, y=1, the cell is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe move.\n    *   **Path Analysis:** From (3, 1), I can go UP to (3, 2) or LEFT to (2, 1).\n    *   **Risk:** (3, 2) is empty, but (3, 3) contains an apple (3, 3 is safe). (3, 4) is `.`. (3, 5) is `.`. (3, 6) is `A`. However, the vertical strip x=3, y=3..6 is \"open\" but leads toward the center. The area x=3, y=7..9 is currently empty. The main risk is that I am moving vertically into the board, potentially creating a \"hallway\" if I try to loop back down later, or crossing paths with the enemy if he decides to head this way (unlikely immediately, but possible). Also, if I go UP and eventually turn LEFT, I might cross my own body if I don't wait for it to clear. My body extends from (4, 0) to (8, 0) then up to (6, 1). If I go UP to (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1), I am safe. If I go UP to (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2), I am safe. This is a viable path.\n\n*   **LEFT (2, 0):**\n    *   Visual check: Row 0 is ` . A . . 1 T T T T .`. At x=2, y=0, the cell is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **Result:** Safe move.\n    *   **Path Analysis:** From (2, 0), I can go LEFT to (1, 0) or UP to (2, 1).\n    *   **Apple Potential:** (1, 0) is an apple. (0, 1) is an apple. (1, 2) is an apple. This is the \"Left Wall\" cluster.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving LEFT keeps me against the left wall (x=0). This provides a solid boundary (no wall-kill risk on the left side) and funnels movement. It maximizes the utility of the left-side apples which are clustered safely. I can easily chain: (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) [Eat] -> (1,1) -> (0,1) [Eat] -> (0,2) -> (1,2) [Eat]. This path is safe, predictable, and gains points quickly.\n\n**3. Comparison and Decision:**\n*   **UP** moves me toward the center and vertical freedom but creates a horizontal barrier (my body at y=0, x>3) that I must navigate around. While safe, it moves away from the densest cluster of low-risk apples on the left side.\n*   **LEFT** moves me toward the left wall and the apple cluster at (1,0). This path is geometrically safer (wall protects one side) and allows for a high-efficiency loop. The enemy is at (8, 6), far to the right. Moving left increases the distance between us and secures a resource-rich zone.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT. It secures immediate apples (1,0) and establishes a safe perimeter along the wall.\n\n**MOVE PLAN:**\n1.  **Turn 21:** Move LEFT to (2, 0).\n2.  **Turn 22:** Move LEFT to (1, 0) to eat the apple. This extends my length.\n3.  **Turn 23:** Move UP to (1, 1) to open up the vertical path.\n4.  **Turn 24:** Move UP to (1, 2) to eat the apple.\n5.  **Turn 25:** Move LEFT to (0, 2) or continue UP depending on body length, securing the corner.\n\nThis plan avoids the enemy, maximizes apple intake in a safe zone, and keeps my body from trapping me.\n\nLEFT",

They are distant and pose no immediate threat to my current position.\n4.  **Available Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 0):** This cell contains an apple ('A'). It is empty of obstacles. Moving here allows me to eat, grow, and gain a point. The path forward from (1, 0) leads to (1, 1), then (0, 1) (another apple), keeping me safe along the left wall.\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 0):** This cell contains my own body (the neck). Moving here results in immediate death.\n    *   **UP (2, 1):** This cell is empty ('.'). While safe, it moves me away from the tight cluster of apples at (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 2). It also places my head (2, 1) directly above my body at (2, 0), (3, 0), etc., potentially creating a trap if I need to backtrack.\n    *   **DOWN:** This is out of bounds (y=-1). Immediate death.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 0) is the optimal choice. It secures an immediate point, positions me to safely collect two more apples ((0, 1) and (1, 2)) in the following turns, and utilizes the left wall as a protective barrier. Moving UP is a safe alternative but delays apple collection and leaves my body blocking the bottom of the board, which could become problematic later. Moving RIGHT is fatal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nCollect the apple at (1, 0). Move to (1, 1) to set up for the apple at (0, 1). Then collect (0, 1) and move to (1, 2) to collect the next apple. This secures a 3-point lead safely against the wall.\n\nLEFT",

The user has provided the state for **Turn 24** (apples at (1, 7), etc.), but the descriptive text for the snake and the last move rationale are from **Turn 23**. The \"Turn: 24 / 150\" label is likely a header for the prompt, while the actual simulation is asking for the move for Turn 24 based on the Turn 23 state.\n\n**I am at Turn 23.**\n**My head is at (1, 0).**\n**I have collected 8 apples (score 8 in the rationale, 9 in the scoreboard might be a discrepancy or include the current turn, but the position (1, 0) is definitive).**\n\n**Analysis of Turn 23 Moves:**\n\n1.  **Current Head:** (1, 0).\n2.  **My Body:**\n    *   (2, 0) - Neck (Directly behind head)\n    *   (3, 0) to (8, 0) - Body\n    *   (8, 1), (7, 1) - Tail\n3.  **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (8, 9), Body at [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4)].\n\n**Evaluate Moves from (1, 0):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (2, 0):**\n    *   Target: (2, 0).\n    *   Status: **Occupied by my own body (neck)**.\n    *   Outcome: **DEATH (Self-collision)**.\n\n*   **UP (1, 1):**\n    *   Target: (1, 1).\n    *   Status: Empty on the board.\n    *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n    *   Pros: Moves toward apples at (0, 1) and (1, 2). Keeps me away from the wall, giving more maneuvering space.\n\n*   **DOWN (1, -1):**\n    *   Target: y = -1.\n    *   Status: Out of bounds.\n    *   Outcome: **DEATH**.\n\n*   **LEFT (0, 0):**\n    *   Target: (0, 0).\n    *   Status: Empty on the board.\n    *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n    *   Pros: Moves me to the absolute corner, hugging the wall. This protects my left and down sides (walls).\n    *   Cons: Limits movement options for the next turn (only can go UP or RIGHT, but RIGHT is usually my own body).\n\n**Comparison and Strategy:**\n\nThe rationale provided in the prompt (which seems to be a log of my previous thought process or a system hint) argues for **LEFT** to (0, 0) to \"hug the wall\". While (0, 0) is safe, it is also a trap. From (0, 0), the only valid move that isn't a wall or immediate self-collision (if the tail hasn't moved) is UP to (0, 1). This puts me on a predictable path.\n\nFrom **(1, 1)**, I have more options:\n- I can go to (0, 1) (Apple).\n- I can go to (1, 2) (Apple).\n- I can go to (2, 1) (Safe space).\n\nThe enemy snake is at the top right (8, 9) and is moving downwards. They are not an immediate threat to me at (1, 0) or (1, 1). The distance is significant (9 units away).\n\nSafety check for **UP (1, 1)**:\n- My body is at x >= 2. (1, 1) is clear.\n- Walls: No.\n- Enemy: No.\n\nSafety check for **LEFT (0, 0)**:\n- My body is at x >= 2. (0, 0) is clear.\n- Walls: Left and Down are walls (safe).\n- Enemy: No.\n\n**Decision:**\nWhile the previous rationale suggested **LEFT**, the immediate safety and future flexibility of **UP** are superior. Moving to (1, 1) opens up the cluster of apples at (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) without immediately trapping myself against the wall. If I go to (0, 0), I am forced to go UP next. If I go to (1, 1), I can choose to go to (0, 1) or (1, 2) next.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"Last Move\" information again, it says \"I need to choose a move for turn 23\" and then \"Decision: Move LEFT to (0, 0).\" This implies the previous step was already decided.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Turn: 24 / 150\".\nIf I am at Turn 24, my head is at (1, 0) (having eaten the apple at (1, 0) on Turn 23).\nIf the prompt is asking for the move for Turn 24, and the \"Last Move\" was LEFT (moving me from (1,0) to (0,0) on Turn 23), then my head is currently at (0, 0).\n\nThere is a conflict in the provided text:\n1. \"Turn: 24 / 150\" implies I am entering Turn 24.\n2. \"Your snake (ID: 1) - Head: (0, 0)\" implies I am at the start of Turn 24 (post-move from 23).\n3. \"Your last move information... LEFT\" implies I moved from (1,0) to (0,0).\n4. \"Scores so far... Your snake apples: 9\" implies I have eaten 9 apples.\n\nIf I am at (0, 0) with 9 apples, I am at the start of Turn 24.\nIf I am at (1, 0) with 8 apples, I am at the start of Turn 23.\n\nLet's re-read carefully.\n\"Turn: 24 / 150\"\n\"Apples at: (1, 7)...\"\n\"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (0, 0)\"\n\"Your last move information: LEFT\"\n\nIt seems the prompt is giving me the state *after* I have moved to (0, 0) for Turn 24.\nIf my head is at (0, 0), I must now choose a move for Turn 24.\n\n**If my head is at (0, 0):**\n- **LEFT:** Wall. (Death).\n- **DOWN:** Wall. (Death).\n- **RIGHT:** (1, 0). My body starts at (2, 0). (1, 0) is safe.\n- **UP:** (0, 1). This is an apple! (Listed in \"Apples at\").\n\nFrom (0, 0):\n- **UP** to (0, 1) is safe (empty space) and eats an apple.\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 0) is safe (empty space, as my tail will move from (7, 1)).\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT from (0, 0):\n- **UP** gets me an apple immediately. This brings my score to 10, matching Snake #0 (currently 10).\n- **RIGHT** moves me to (1, 0), which is safe but doesn't eat an apple immediately. The apples near (0, 0) are at (0, 1) and (1, 2). From (1, 0), I can go UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0) (but I just came from there).\n\n**If the prompt implies I am at (1, 0) (Turn 23):**\n- I would choose **UP** to (1, 1) to avoid the trap of (0, 0).\n\n**If the prompt implies I am at (0, 0) (Turn 24):**\n- I should choose **UP** to (0, 1) to eat the apple.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let's look at the structure of the prompt. It lists \"Turn: 24 / 150\". The \"Your last move information\" is usually context for the *current* turn. If the prompt says \"Turn 24\", I should provide the move for Turn 24.\n\nAssuming the state provided (Head: (0, 0)) is the *current* state for Turn 24:\n- **UP (0, 1)** is an apple.\n- **RIGHT (1, 0)** is empty.\n\nIs (0, 1) safe?\nBoard state for Turn 24 shows `1` (my head) at (0,0).\nApples at (0, 1).\nMy body is at [(1, 0), (2, 0)...].\nSo (0, 1) is not occupied by my body.\nThe enemy snake is at the top right.\nSo (0, 1) is safe.\n\nIs (1, 0) safe?\nMy body is at (2, 0) onwards. (1, 0) is empty.\nSo (1, 0) is safe.\n\nStrategy: Eat the apple at (0, 1).\nMoving UP gives me a point and brings me closer to the other apples in that cluster ((1, 2), (2, 3)).\nMoving RIGHT keeps me on the bottom edge, which is generally less flexible than the interior or the corner-adjacent spots.\n\nDecision: Move **UP**.\n\nWait, if I am at (0, 0) and I move UP to (0, 1), I am eating an apple. My tail will not move (I grow). My body is currently [(1, 0), (2, 0)...].\nNext turn (Turn 25), I will be at (0, 1). My tail will still be at (7, 1) (assuming I haven't eaten enough to shift it much, or if I have 9 apples, the tail is at a specific position).\nActually, looking at the \"Your snake\" section:\nHead: (0, 0)\nBody: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]\nTail: (8, 1) (last element).\nApples: 9.\n\nIf I eat an apple at (0, 1), my score becomes 10.\nMy new body will be: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)].\nI will grow, so the tail (8, 1) stays.\n\nThis seems like a very solid move. It secures a point and denies the area.\n\nOne final check. The \"Scores so far\" says my apples: 9. Snake #0 apples: 10.\nIf I eat one, I reach 10. Tie.\nSnake #0 is at (8, 9). Are there apples near him?\nApples at (8, 4), (9, 1), (5, 8).\nHe is chasing downwards. I am safe in the bottom left.\n\nUP is the best move.\n\nWait, if I am at (1, 0) and the prompt is asking for Turn 23, I should move UP to (1, 1).\nBut the prompt header says \"Turn: 24 / 150\".\nAnd the \"Your snake\" section says \"Head: (0, 0)\".\nThis strongly suggests I am at the start of Turn 24, having moved to (0, 0) on Turn 23.\n\nIf I am at (1, 0) (Turn 23), the \"Head: (0, 0)\" is a lie.\nIf I am at (0, 0) (Turn 24), the \"Turn: 24\" is correct.\nI will trust the explicit state description (\"Head: (0, 0)\") and the Turn counter.\n\nIf I am at (0, 0), I move UP.\n\nOne edge case: Moving UP from (0, 0) puts me at (0, 1). Is it possible the enemy snake #0 could reach (0, 1)?\nSnake #0 is at (8, 9). Distance is 8 columns + 8 rows = 16 steps. Impossible in one turn.\n\nConclusion: Move UP.\n\nFinal check on constraints.\n- Not out of bounds (UP from 0 is valid).\n- Not into my body (My body starts at (1, 0)).\n- Not into enemy body.\n- Increases score.\n\nThe move is UP.\n\nWait, if I am at (1, 0) and the prompt is asking for Turn 23, and I move UP to (1, 1), that is also valid.\nBut (1, 1) is not an apple. (0, 1) is the apple.\nIf I am at (0, 0), I get the apple.\nIf I am at (1, 0), I don't.\n\nGiven the specific mention of \"Head: (0, 0)\" and the apples list including (0, 1), it is highly likely I am positioned to take that apple. Taking apples is the primary way to win. If I am at (1, 0), I should move LEFT to (0, 0) to set up for the apple next turn. But if I am at (0, 0), I should take it now.\n\nThe prompt asks \"You are controlling a snake... Turn: 24 / 150\". This implies I am making a decision for Turn 24.\nState for Turn 24: Head (0, 0).\nAction for Turn 24: Move UP to (0, 1).\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT not only collects an apple immediately but also moves me away from the board's left edge, giving me more maneuvering room in the future.\n\nThe apple at (1,2) is available and safe to take.

My strategy should be to safely collect apples while maintaining escape routes. Moving RIGHT to (2,2) gives me immediate points and keeps me away from my left-side body cluster. From (2,2), I'll have access to apples at (5,2) and potentially (2,3), (2,6), etc. I need to avoid getting trapped against walls or my own body. The enemy is in the top-right, so I'll keep an eye on their movements and try to stay in the center/right area where I have more options.

My strategy should be to safely collect apples while maintaining escape routes. Moving UP to (2,3) gives me immediate points and a better position in the center/right area. From (2,3), I'll have access to apples at (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7) and potentially (5,4), (8,4). I need to avoid getting trapped against walls or my own body. The enemy is in the top-right, so I'll keep an eye on their movements and try to stay in the center/right area where I have more options. My immediate priority is to collect the apple at (2,3) and then assess the safest path to the next reachable apple while considering the enemy's potential moves.\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules and win conditions:\n- All snakes move simultaneously each turn.\n- Each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples. If multiple snakes reach 30 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",

However, the initial state provided shows my head at (3,2) with body starting at (2,2). Let me re-read the state carefully.\n\nThe board state shows:\nRow 2: \"T T T 1 . A . . . .\"\nThis means:\n- (0,2) = T (tail/body)\n- (1,2) = T (tail/body)\n- (2,2) = T (tail/body)\n- (3,2) = 1 (my head)\n- (4,2) = .

Let me verify the coordinates from the prompt:\n- My snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (3, 2)\n  - Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)]\n\nSo my head is currently at (3, 2).

LEFT to (2,2):\n   - Board shows (2,2) is \"T\" (my own body!)\n   - This is UNSAFE - would hit myself\n\n4. RIGHT to (4,2):\n   - Board shows (4,2) is \".\" (empty)\n   - Check if it's my body: No\n   - This is safe\n\nSo unsafe moves: LEFT only.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow I need to consider the apple at (5,2) to the right. If I move RIGHT to (4,2), then next turn I could move RIGHT again to (5,2) and get the apple.\n\nLet me think about strategy:\n- Score is tied 11-11\n- I need to collect apples while staying alive\n- My body is mostly in the bottom left, so I have room to move right/up\n- The enemy is in the top right (near (4,8))\n- I should avoid moving into a trap or giving the enemy a chance to head-on collide\n\nPotential head-on collision considerations:\n- Enemy is at (4,8) - far away from me at (3,2)\n- Enemy could move towards me, but I'm far enough that immediate collision is unlikely\n- I should keep options open\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- UP (3,3): Opens up more space above. From there I can go to apples at (3,6), (2,6), etc.\n- DOWN (3,1): Moves me toward bottom edge. I have body at (3,0) and (2,0), etc. This might be more confined.\n- RIGHT (4,2): Moves me toward apple at (5,2). From (4,2) I can go RIGHT to (5,2) for apple, or UP to (4,3), or DOWN to (4,1).\n\nLooking at apples reachable:\n- (5,2) - directly to the right, 1 step away\n- (4,3) - up-right from me\n- (3,6) - up-left\n- (2,6) - up-left\n\nMy current position (3,2) is close to several apples. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) gives me immediate access to (5,2) apple. Moving UP gives me access to other apples but doesn't get me an immediate point.\n\nSince the score is tied and I need every point, and RIGHT is safe and gives me access to an apple next turn, that seems optimal.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider the enemy's move. The enemy is at (4,8). Could they move to intercept me? It's possible but unlikely in one turn. More importantly, if I move RIGHT to (4,2) and they move DOWN-left toward me, we might collide in future turns, but for this turn, they're far away.\n\nLet me reconsider the board more carefully. The board shows apples at:\n(1,7), (9,1), (1,8), (4,3), (3,6), (0,7), (2,3), (2,8), (8,4), (5,4), (2,6), (1,6), (5,2), (6,5), (3,7)\n\nMy current head (3,2) is near:\n- (4,3) - up-right\n- (5,2) - right\n- (3,6) - up\n\nI think moving RIGHT is good because:\n1. It's safe (no immediate collision)\n2. It positions me to eat the apple at (5,2) next turn\n3. It gives me more options in the center/right area\n4. My body is mostly on the left, so moving right opens up space\n\nActually, let me double-check the coordinates. The board shows row 2: \"T T T 1 . A\"\nThis is:\n- (0,2): T\n- (1,2): T\n- (2,2): T\n- (3,2): 1 (my head)\n- (4,2): . (empty)\n- (5,2): A (apple)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe and positions me to eat the apple at (5,2) next turn.\n\nBut I should also consider if moving UP is better strategically. From (3,3), I could access apples at (3,6), (2,6), etc. But I wouldn't get a point immediately.\n\nGiven the tie score and the proximity to (5,2), I think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nWait, I need to think about the enemy's potential move. They are at (4,8). If they move DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN again to (4,6), etc., they could eventually come toward me. But for this turn, they're 6 steps away vertically.\n\nActually, let me reconsider my body position. My body goes from (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (6,0).\n\nSo my body is in a sort of \"L\" shape on the left side and bottom. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) is clear.\n\nI think RIGHT is the correct move. It gives me immediate access to an apple and keeps my options open.\n\nActually, let me think about the long-term plan. I'm tied 11-11. I need to lead. The apple at (5,2) is one step away. If I move RIGHT to (4,2), next turn I can move RIGHT to (5,2) and get the apple. That would put me at 12 vs 11.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,3), I'm not getting an apple immediately, and the nearest apple is at (2,3) or (4,3), but they're 1-2 steps away.\n\nSo RIGHT seems better for immediate gain.\n\nBut what about safety? From (4,2), what are my options?\n- RIGHT to (5,2) - apple, but then my body moves forward, so (4,2) becomes part of my body\n- UP to (4,3) - apple at (4,3)\n- DOWN to (4,1) - empty\n- LEFT to (3,2) - my current head, but after I move, (3,2) will be my body, so LEFT would be into my own body\n\nSo from (4,2), I have 3 safe directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN).\n\nFrom (3,3) if I move UP:\n- UP to (3,4) - empty\n- RIGHT to (4,3) - apple\n- LEFT to (2,3) - apple\n- DOWN to (3,2) - will be my body\n\nSo also 3 safe directions.\n\nBoth give similar safety. But RIGHT gives me faster access to the apple at (5,2).\n\nOne more consideration: The enemy is at (4,8). If they move DOWN, they could be closer. But I'm at (3,2), they're at (4,8). We're not on the same column. If they move DOWN to (4,7), (4,6), etc., and I move RIGHT to (4,2), I'm still far apart.\n\nActually, wait. If I move RIGHT to (4,2), and the enemy moves DOWN to (4,7), we're still far. But if we both keep moving toward each other, we could eventually collide. However, that's a future concern.\n\nFor now, I think RIGHT is the best move because:\n1. It's safe\n2. It positions me to eat an apple next turn\n3. It gives me good options for subsequent moves\n\nLet me also consider if there's any trap I'm walking into. The board shows a lot of \"T\" (snake body) in the bottom rows, but that's my own body. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) is clear.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\nActually, wait. I just realized something. Looking at the board again:\nRow 2: \"T T T 1 . A . . . .\"\nRow 1: \"T . . . . . . . . A\"\nRow 0: \"T T T T T T T . . .\"\n\nMy body is at:\n- (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)\n- (0,1)\n- (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)\n\nSo (3,1) is empty. If I move DOWN to (3,1), that's also safe.\n\nBut from (3,1), what are my options?\n- UP to (3,2) - will be my body\n- DOWN to (3,0) - my body\n- LEFT to (2,1) - empty\n- RIGHT to (4,1) - empty\n\nSo only 2 safe directions from (3,1) (LEFT and RIGHT). That's more confined.\n\nFrom (4,2) (if I move RIGHT):\n- RIGHT to (5,2) - apple\n- UP to (4,3) - apple\n- DOWN to (4,1) - empty\n- LEFT to (3,2) - will be my body\n\nSo 3 safe directions. Better than (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) (if I move UP):\n- UP to (3,4) - empty\n- DOWN to (3,2) - will be my body\n- LEFT to (2,3) - apple\n- RIGHT to (4,3) - apple\n\nSo also 3 safe directions, but includes two apples.\n\nHmm, both (3,3) and (4,2) give 3 safe options. (3,3) gives access to two apples (2,3) and (4,3), while (4,2) gives access to one apple (5,2) directly next turn.\n\nBut wait, from (3,3), I can get to (2,3) or (4,3). Let me check:\n- (2,3) shows \"A\" in the board\n- (4,3) shows \"A\" in the board\n\nSo from (3,3), I have two adjacent apples! That's actually better than (4,2) which only has (5,2) adjacent.\n\nLet me reconsider. If I move UP to (3,3):\n- Next turn I can go LEFT to (2,3) to get apple\n- OR RIGHT to (4,3) to get apple\n- OR UP to (3,4) to keep moving\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,2):\n- Next turn I can go RIGHT to (5,2) to get apple\n- OR UP to (4,3) to get apple\n- OR DOWN to (4,1)\n\nSo (3,3) gives me two adjacent apples, while (4,2) gives me one adjacent apple directly and one at (4,3) that's 1 step away.\n\nActually, from (4,2), (4,3) is also adjacent (UP), so I can get it in one move too.\n\nLet me list the adjacent cells:\nFrom (3,3):\n- (2,3): apple\n- (3,2): will be my body\n- (3,4): empty\n- (4,3): apple\n\nFrom (4,2):\n- (3,2): will be my body\n- (4,1): empty\n- (4,3): apple\n- (5,2): apple\n\nSo both positions have two apples adjacent. (3,3) has apples at (2,3) and (4,3). (4,2) has apples at (4,3) and (5,2).\n\nWhich is better? Let me think about long-term positioning.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), I'm more central. From there I can access:\n- (2,3) apple\n- (4,3) apple\n- (2,6) apple (further up)\n- (3,6) apple (further up)\n- (2,8) apple (top area)\n\nIf I go to (4,2), I'm more to the right. From there I can access:\n- (4,3) apple\n- (5,2) apple\n- (5,4) apple (further up-right)\n- (8,4) apple (further right)\n- (6,5) apple\n\nThe enemy is at (4,8) in the top-right. If I go to (4,2), I'm in the same column as the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN toward me, we could have a head-on collision in future turns.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), I'm not in the same column, so less risk of head-on collision with the enemy.\n\nAlso, from (3,3), I have access to more apples that are clustered together (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (2,8). This is a dense apple area in the top-left center.\n\nFrom (4,2), the apples are more spread out.\n\nGiven that the enemy is in the top-right, going to (3,3) (left/center) might be safer from the enemy and give me access to a dense apple cluster.\n\nBut wait, let me check the board again for the apple cluster:\n- (2,3): apple\n- (2,6): apple\n- (2,8): apple\n- (3,6): apple\n- (3,7): apple\n- (1,6): apple\n- (1,7): apple\n- (1,8): apple\n\nYes, there's a dense apple cluster in the top-left center area.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,8), which is to the right of this cluster.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), I can start navigating toward that cluster while staying away from the enemy.\n\nIf I go to (4,2), I'm moving toward the enemy's area.\n\nGiven the tie score and the long game (150 turns, we're at 29), I should prioritize safety from the enemy while collecting apples.\n\nMoving UP to (3,3) seems like the better strategic choice. It keeps me away from the enemy's column and gives me access to a dense apple cluster.\n\nBut I need to be careful about my own body. Let me trace my body again:\nHead: (3,2)\nBody: (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0)\n\nSo (3,3) is clear. Moving UP is safe.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The immediate apple access:\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- If I move UP to (3,3), next turn I can get either (2,3) or (4,3) apple\n- If I move RIGHT to (4,2), next turn I can get either (5,2) or (4,3) apple\n\nBoth give me an apple next turn. So immediate gain is the same.\n\nBut strategic positioning:\n- (3,3) is central, away from enemy's column\n- (4,2) is in enemy's column, potentially dangerous\n\nTherefore, UP is better for long-term safety.\n\nWait, but there's another consideration. The enemy is at (4,8). If they move DOWN to (4,7), (4,6), etc., they're coming toward the center. If I'm at (3,3), we're not in the same column, so no direct head-on collision risk. If I'm at (4,2), and they move down, we're in the same column and could eventually collide.\n\nSo UP to (3,3) is safer from enemy collision.\n\nAlso, from (3,3), I have more apples immediately accessible (2,3 and 4,3).\n\nLet me check if (2,3) and (4,3) are indeed apples. The board shows:\nRow 3: \". . A . A . . . . .\"\n- (0,3): .\n- (1,3): .\n- (2,3): A\n- (3,3): .\n- (4,3): A\n- (5,3): .\n- etc.\n\nYes, both (2,3) and (4,3) are apples.\n\nSo from (3,3), I have two adjacent apples.\n\nFrom (4,2), I have one adjacent apple (5,2) directly, and (4,3) is also adjacent (UP), so actually two adjacent apples too.\n\nWait, from (4,2):\n- RIGHT to (5,2): apple\n- UP to (4,3): apple\n\nSo also two adjacent apples.\n\nSo both positions give me two adjacent apples. The difference is strategic positioning.\n\nGiven the enemy is at (4,8), and I want to avoid being in the same column, UP to (3,3) seems better.\n\nBut there's one more thing to consider. My body is mostly on the left side. If I move UP to (3,3), I'm moving away from my body, which is good. If I move RIGHT to (4,2), I'm also moving away from my body (which is more left/bottom).\n\nBoth moves are away from my body, so both are good in that regard.\n\nI think the key difference is enemy collision risk. Since the enemy is in column 4 (at (4,8)), if I go to column 4 (at (4,2)), we're in the same column. If the enemy moves down and I move up, we could eventually meet in the middle.\n\nIf I go to column 3 (at (3,3)), we're not in the same column, so collision is less likely unless we move diagonally toward each other.\n\nTherefore, UP to (3,3) is safer from enemy collision.\n\nAlso, from (3,3), I can access the dense apple cluster in the top-left center area, while the enemy is in the top-right.\n\nSo my decision is UP to (3,3).\n\nWait, but I need to double-check the board one more time to make sure (3,3) is empty.\n\nRow 3: \". . A . A . . . . .\"\n- (3,3) is the fourth entry (0-indexed: 0,1,2,3)\n- The string is: \". . A . A\"\n- Positions: 0=., 1=., 2=A, 3=., 4=A\n- So (3,3) = . (empty)\n\nYes, it's empty.\n\nAnd it's not my body. My body is at (2,2), (1,2), etc., and below at (3,0).\n\nSo UP is safe.\n\nActually, let me think about one more thing. The enemy's head is at (4,8). What apples are near them?\n- (3,7): apple (left-down from enemy)\n- (2,8): apple (left from enemy)\n- (1,8): apple (further left)\n- (4,3): apple (down from enemy, but also accessible to me)\n- (5,4): apple (down-right)\n\nThe enemy has many options too. If they go for (3,7) or (2,8), they're moving left, away from me. If they go for (4,3), they're moving down toward me.\n\nBut if they go for (4,3), they would have to travel from (4,8) to (4,3), which is 5 steps. I'm at (3,2). If I move UP to (3,3), I'm at (3,3). If they move DOWN to (4,7), (4,6), etc., and I move UP to (3,4), (3,5), etc., we're still not in the same column.\n\nActually, if I'm at (3,3) and they're at (4,8), we're one column apart. If they move DOWN to (4,7) and I move UP to (3,4), we're still one column apart and different rows.\n\nI think UP is safer.\n\nLet me also consider if I should move RIGHT to (4,2) instead. From (4,2), if the enemy moves DOWN to (4,7), we're still far apart. But if we both keep moving toward each other in the same column, we could eventually collide.\n\nFrom (3,3), even if we both move toward each other, we're in different columns, so collision is less likely unless one of us moves sideways.\n\nGiven the long game (121 turns left after this), avoiding the same column as the enemy seems wise.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP to (3,3).\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (3,3) to access the dense apple cluster in the top-left center (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), etc. This keeps me away from the enemy in column 4 and gives me multiple apple options. From (3,3), I can collect (2,3) or (4,3) next turn, then navigate toward the cluster while monitoring the enemy's movement.\n\nUP",

I need to evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1. **LEFT to (2,2)**: The board shows (2,2) is occupied by my own body (as indicated by \"T\" in the board state and my body list). This would result in immediate death. **UNSAFE**\n\n2. **DOWN to (3,1)**: The board shows (3,1) is empty (\".\"). This is safe from immediate collision. However, this moves me toward the bottom edge where my body is densely packed. From (3,1), I would only have 2 safe directions (LEFT to (2,1) and RIGHT to (4,1)), limiting my future options.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (4,2)**: The board shows (4,2) is empty (\".\"). This is safe from immediate collision. It positions me to potentially eat the apple at (5,2) next turn. From (4,2), I would have 3 safe directions (RIGHT to (5,2), UP to (4,3), DOWN to (4,1)). However, this moves me closer to column 4 where the enemy snake (#0) is located (head at (4,8)). Moving into the same column as the enemy increases collision risk in future turns, especially in a 10x10 board where paths can cross.\n\n4. **UP to (3,3)**: The board shows (3,3) is empty (\".\"). This is safe from immediate collision. It moves me away from the enemy in column 4 and toward the dense apple cluster in the center-left area ((2,3), (2,6), (3,6), etc.). From (3,3), I would have 3 safe directions (UP to (3,4), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3)). This also maintains spatial separation from the enemy, reducing head-on collision risk.\n\n**Strategic Consideration**: The score is tied 11-11, and there are 121 turns remaining. Since the enemy is in column 4 at (4,8), moving to (3,3) in column 3 keeps me in a different column, making accidental head-on collisions less likely. The apple cluster in the center-left region offers multiple scoring opportunities while maintaining board control.\n\n**Decision**: UP to (3,3)\n\n**Long-term Plan**: Move toward the apple cluster in the center-left ((2,3), (2,6), (3,6)) while staying in columns 2-3 to avoid the enemy in column 4. Monitor enemy movements each turn to avoid collision. Prioritize safety over immediate apples to ensure survival for the full game duration.\n\nUP",

This increases the risk of future head-on collisions.\n   - From (4,4), I would have: UP to (4,5) [empty], RIGHT to (5,4) [apple], DOWN to (4,3) [apple], LEFT back to (3,4) [my body].\n   - While there are apples nearby, being in column 4 puts me directly in the path of the enemy, who is moving toward lower Y values.\n\n3. **DOWN to (3,3)**:\n   - Board state shows (3,3) is empty.\n   - Safe from immediate collision.\n   - This is my previous position, and the body will shift up, making it safe to return.\n   - From (3,3), I would have: UP to (3,4) [my body], DOWN to (3,2) [empty], LEFT to (2,3) [apple], RIGHT to (4,3) [apple].\n   - This offers a safe option with access to two apples ((2,3) and (4,3)).\n\n**Strategic Analysis**:\n- **Safety**: LEFT is safest as it moves me away from the enemy in column 4. The enemy is at (2,8), and moving to (2,4) is 4 units below them. Since we move simultaneously, the enemy could move DOWN to (2,7), but that would still be 3 units away. HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK is minimal.\n- **Scoring**: Both LEFT and DOWN offer access to apples. LEFT targets (2,3), DOWN targets (2,3) and (4,3).\n- **Board Control**: LEFT moves me to column 2, which is currently \"quiet\" (no enemy, few apples, but open space). DOWN keeps me in column 3, which is also relatively safe.\n\n**Decision**: LEFT to (2,4).\nWhy? It moves me away from the immediate threat of the enemy (column 4) and into an open column (2). It maintains a safe distance from the enemy's head. It sets up a path to the apple at (2,3) or (3,3) next turn. It avoids the potential trap of staying in column 3 where my body is vertically aligned, potentially limiting mobility.\n\n**Long-term Plan**: Move to column 2 to avoid the enemy in column 4. Collect apples in the left-center region ((2,3), (1,6), (2,6)) while maintaining distance from Snake #0. Monitor enemy Y coordinate; if it drops significantly, be prepared to shift right again. Prioritize survival over risky apple grabs.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

LEFT and UP are safe but offer no immediate points. Since survival is paramount but scoring is necessary to win, taking a guaranteed, safe apple is the optimal play.\n\nI will move DOWN to collect the apple at (2,3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (2,3) to eat the apple. From (2,3), I can look towards (1,3) or (2,2) (though 2,2 is my tail later) or back to (2,4). The left side of the board seems relatively safe from the enemy snake, which is currently on the right side (Snake #0 at (1,8) but body mostly on right).

          "rationale": "Based on the provided game state, my current head is at `(2, 3)` after moving `DOWN` on the previous turn. I must determine my next move for turn 33.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** `(2, 3)`\n*   **Apple Eaten:** I moved `DOWN` from `(2, 4)` to `(2, 3)`, successfully eating the apple at `(2, 3)`. My score increases to 13.\n*   **My Body:** My body has shifted. The segment that was at `(2, 4)` (my previous head) is now at `(2, 3)`? No, wait. The rule is that the head moves to the new cell, and the tail moves off unless an apple was eaten. Since I ate an apple at `(2, 3)`, I grow by 1. The new body is my old body *plus* the old head position `(2, 4)`.\n    *   New Head: `(2, 3)`\n    *   New Body (pre-shift, then append old head): `[(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]`\n    *   *Correction:* The body listed in the prompt was from the previous turn. My new body effectively includes `(2, 4)` as the first body segment. The tail `(3, 0)` remains (unless I eat again).\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(1, 7)`, body extends downwards on the right side (y=6 down to y=5) and left side (x=1..8, y=8,9). Distance from my head `(2, 3)` to enemy head `(1, 7)` is roughly 4 units vertical + 1 horizontal. We are moving towards each other.\n*   **Board Apples:** 15 apples listed.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (2, 3):**\nPossible moves: UP `(2, 4)`, DOWN `(2, 2)`, LEFT `(1, 3)`, RIGHT `(3, 3)`.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):**\n    *   **Immediate:** `(2, 4)` is empty on the board (last turn's board state). Is it occupied by my body?\n    *   **Body Check:** My new body includes `(2, 4)` (my previous head position). Moving UP into `(2, 4)` means moving into the segment that just disconnected from my head.\n    *   **Result:** Collision with my own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Decision:** Eliminated.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):**\n    *   **Immediate:** `(2, 2)` contains an apple 'A'.\n    *   **Body Check:** Is `(2, 2)` in my body? The current body (pre-move) is at `(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2) ...`. `(2, 2)` is *not* in this list (it is the tail position `(2, 2)`? Wait, looking at the prompt's body list: `[(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2)...]`. Yes, `(2, 2)` is currently occupied by my body!\n    *   **Result:** Collision with my own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Decision:** Eliminated.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):**\n    *   **Immediate:** `(1, 3)` contains an apple 'A'.\n    *   **Body Check:** Is `(1, 3)` in my body? My body is at `x >= 2` (mostly) or `x=0,1` at `y=2,1,0`. `(1, 3)` is clear.\n    *   **Enemy Check:** Snake #0 is at `y=5` to `y=9` (mostly). The closest body segment is `(1, 8)`. `y=3` is safe.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. I eat an apple (score 14). I grow.\n    *   **Future:** From `(1, 3)`, I have access to `(0, 3)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`. `(1, 2)` is currently my body, but by the next turn, `(1, 2)` will be free (tail moves). This seems viable.\n    *   **Decision:** Strong candidate.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Immediate:** `(3, 3)` is empty.\n    *   **Body Check:** Is `(3, 3)` in my body? Yes. My body is at `..., (3, 3), ...`.\n    *   **Result:** Collision with my own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Decision:** Eliminated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly **LEFT** is a safe move. It allows me to eat an apple at `(1, 3)` and survive. Moving DOWN into `(2, 2)` would kill me because my tail is there. Moving UP into `(2, 4)` kills me because my neck is there.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to `(1, 3)` to eat the apple. From `(1, 3)`, I can explore the left side of the board where there are fewer enemy interactions. I need to be careful of my own body wrapping around. I will look to move towards `(0, 3)` or `(0, 4)` next.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Based on the game state at turn 34, my snake (ID 1) has its head at `(1, 3)` after having moved `LEFT` on the previous turn (Turn 33). The provided \"Last Move Information\" confirms that the chosen move for Turn 33 was `LEFT`. I am now to choose a move for Turn 34.\n\n**Analysis of Current State:**\n*   **Head:** `(1, 3)`\n*   **Body:** The previous body was `[(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0)]`.\n    *   Since I moved `LEFT` to `(1, 3)` and I see an apple at `(1, 3)` in the board state, I have eaten an apple. I did not lose my tail.\n    *   My new head is `(1, 3)`.\n    *   My new body segments are: `(1, 3)` (old head), `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, `(2, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 2)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(2, 0)`, `(3, 0)`.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(1, 6)`, body extends around the top and right. It is currently \"hunting\" me, having moved from `(1, 7)` to `(1, 6)`. We are on a collision course if I move UP.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Turn 34):**\nFrom `(1, 3)`, my possible moves are UP `(1, 4)`, DOWN `(1, 2)`, LEFT `(0, 3)`, RIGHT `(2, 3)`.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** The board state at `(1, 4)` shows `.` (empty).\n    *   **Body:** Is `(1, 4)` in my body? No. My body occupies `(1, 3)` (current head) and `(1, 2)` further down.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at `(1, 6)`. If Snake #0 moves DOWN to `(1, 5)`, and I move UP to `(1, 4)`, we do not collide directly. However, Snake #0 is aggressively chasing. Moving directly towards the enemy head is dangerous. If Snake #0 moves DOWN twice (which is impossible, only one move per turn), it would hit me. But head-on collision only happens if we land on the *same* cell. `(1, 4)` is safe from immediate collision on this turn.\n    *   **Future:** Moving UP opens the path to `(1, 5)` and potentially the top area, but risks trapping myself against the enemy or walls later.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** The board state shows an apple at `(1, 2)`.\n    *   **Body:** My body list (from before the move) includes `(1, 2)`. Since I ate an apple on the last move, my tail `(3, 0)` did not move. Therefore, `(1, 2)` is currently occupied by my own body segment.\n    *   **Result:** Collision with own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Decision:** Eliminated.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** `(0, 3)` is within bounds `(0,0)` to `(9,9)`. Looking at the board state:\n        ```\n         3 . 1 T T A . . . . A\n        ```\n        Column 0 is `.` (empty) for Row 3.\n    *   **Body:** My body is at `(1, 3)`, `(2, 3)`, etc. `(0, 3)` is empty of my body.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is far away at `(1, 6)`.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. No immediate apple, but survivable.\n    *   **Future:** From `(0, 3)`, I can move DOWN to `(0, 2)`. `(0, 2)` is currently occupied by my body, but it is the \"neck\" connecting to the tail. By the time I reach `(0, 3)` and want to move to `(0, 2)` next turn, the tail `(3, 0)` will have moved (unless I eat again). If I don't eat, `(0, 2)` will be the *new* tail and will be safe to move into. This seems like a valid path to wrap around the left wall.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** `(2, 3)` is empty.\n    *   **Body:** My body (post-move) includes `(2, 3)` (the segment immediately following the head). This is the cell I just vacated. Moving back into the body segment behind the head is illegal and results in death.\n    *   **Result:** Collision with own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Decision:** Eliminated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only viable moves that avoid immediate death are UP `(1, 4)` and LEFT `(0, 3)`.\n*   Moving UP leads me toward the enemy snake #0. While a collision isn't guaranteed this turn, the enemy is moving towards me, and this path narrows my long-term options.\n*   Moving LEFT `(0, 3)` moves me away from the enemy, into an open area (Column 0 is largely clear), and allows me to navigate the left side of the board where there are apples (e.g., `(0, 7)`).\n\nStrategy: Survive and outmaneuver. Avoid the aggressive enemy head-on collision path. Go LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Since I moved `LEFT` to `(0, 3)` and there was no apple at `(0, 3)`, I did not grow. The tail `(3, 0)` has moved.\n    *   The new body segments are: `(0, 3)` (old head), `(1, 3)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, `(2, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 2)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, `(2, 0)`.\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** The cell `(0, 2)` is currently occupied by my body. The cell `(0, 1)` is also occupied.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(2, 6)`, body extends down to `(1, 6)` and around the top. It is likely moving towards me or hunting apples near `(3, 6)` or `(3, 7)`.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Turn 35):**\nFrom `(0, 3)`, possible moves are UP `(0, 4)`, DOWN `(0, 2)`, LEFT (impossible, off-board), RIGHT `(1, 3)`.\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** Looking at the board state for Row 4, Column 0 is `.` (empty).\n    *   **Body:** My body does not extend to `(0, 4)` yet.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is far away at `(2, 6)`.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Future:** This keeps me along the left wall.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** `(0, 2)` is within bounds.\n    *   **Body:** My body list (before this move) includes `(0, 2)`. Since I ate an apple at `(0, 2)` on Turn 32? No, looking at the apple list, `(0, 7)` is an apple, but `(0, 2)` is not in the list of available apples. However, the body list provided in the prompt shows `(0, 2)` is part of my body.\n    *   **Analysis:** The body list is ordered head-to-tail. The tail is `(2, 0)`. The segment at `(0, 2)` is \"older\" than the tail. Since I did not eat an apple on the last move (Turn 34), the tail moved forward.

Moving back into the cell immediately behind the head is forbidden.\n    *   **Result:** Death. **Eliminate.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only available safe move is **UP**. I must continue up the left wall to survive and open up future paths.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP along the left wall (Column 0). The goal is to reach the apple at `(0, 7)` and eventually open up the right side of the board or drop down the right column (Column 9) which seems relatively clear based on the enemy's position. I must be careful to avoid trapping myself in the corner. Moving UP is the only viable option.\n\nUP",

My body occupies `(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)` and extends to the right.\nPossible moves:\n- **UP to `(0, 5)`**: Check board state (Row 5, Col 0). It is empty (`.`). Check body. My body at `(0, 3)` and below is currently safe as I move away. There is no immediate body collision. Enemy snake #0 is at `(3, 6)`, far enough away to not threaten immediate collision on this turn unless it moves significantly towards `(0, 5)`. Since it has 17 apples and is likely hunting, it might move towards the cluster of apples at `(3, 7)` or `(4, 3)`. Moving UP keeps me on the left edge and moves towards the apple at `(0, 7)`.\n- **DOWN to `(0, 3)`**: This is the cell immediately behind my head. Moving here is invalid (backwards into self). **Eliminated**.\n- **RIGHT to `(1, 4)`**: Check board state (Row 4, Col 1). It is `.` (empty). Check body. `(1, 4)` is not currently in my body list. This is a valid move. However, this moves me away from the left wall and into the center. My current body is tightly packed on the left side (column 0). Moving right puts me at `(1, 4)`, while my body occupies `(0, 3), (0, 2)...`. This opens up paths, but I need to be careful about the enemy. The enemy is at `(3, 6)`. If I move RIGHT, I am closer to the enemy's potential path. If I stay UP on the wall, I am safer from flanking.\n- **LEFT to `( -1, 4 )`**: Off the board. **Eliminated**.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP**: Keeps me on the wall (maximum safety on one side). Moves towards `(0, 7)` (1 point). My body is currently somewhat bunched on the left side of the board (columns 0 and 1). Moving UP stretches the tail along column 0. If I need to turn later, I have the column 0 wall as a barrier.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves me towards the center. While `(1, 4)` is safe now, the center is a danger zone with the enemy snake nearby. The enemy snake has a long body and is active. Engaging in the center risks collision.\n\nThe safest strategy to outlast the enemy is to stick to the wall where possible, using it as a shield. The apple at `(0, 7)` is a clear objective. Moving UP is the best way to chase that apple and stay safe.\n\nUP",

Enemy cannot reach me this turn.\n  - However, Enemy could move to `(2, 7)` or `(3, 8)` or `(4, 7)`. Moving `(3, 7) -> (2, 7)` is blocked by Enemy's own body at `(2, 6)`? No, `(2, 7)` is empty on the board (`.`). But `(1, 7)` is part of the Enemy's body.\n  - If Enemy moves `(3, 7) -> (2, 7)`, it is safe for them. It puts them adjacent to my potential position `(0, 6)`.\n  - If I stay at `(0, 6)`, I am safe from immediate collision but exposed to a chase on the open edge.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to `(1, 5)`**:\n- I move into the open center.\n- My body currently blocks `(0, 4), (0, 3)`.\n- If I move `(0, 5) -> (1, 5)`, my tail `(0, 0)` moves to `(0, 1)`.\n- Enemy #0 at `(3, 7)` is far away.\n- This move frees up the left wall. It allows me to maneuver around the obstacles in the center (the cluster of apples and obstacles at `(2, 3)-(3, 4)`).\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison**\n- **Option UP (Sticking to Wall)**:\n  - Pros: Wall protects my left side. Headed towards apple `(0, 7)`. Limits exposure to Enemy #0 who is on the right side.\n  - Cons: The left side is getting \"filled\" by my own tail. If I keep going UP, I might eventually trap myself if I don't clear the lower body. However, my tail is moving UP as I move UP, so the space at the bottom clears.\n- **Option RIGHT (Moving Center)**:\n  - Pros: Moves towards the center apples. Opens up flexibility.\n  - Cons: Puts me in the \"Danger Zone\" where Enemy #0 operates. Enemy #0 is highly aggressive (18 apples). Engaging in the center increases the probability of a head-on collision or being trapped by the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSticking to the wall is the classic survival strategy against a longer, aggressive snake. By moving UP, I force the enemy to come all the way to the left edge to attack me, giving me time to react. Moving RIGHT exposes me too early. I will take the apple at `(0, 7)` when safe.\n\nMove: UP",

Note: `(0, 0)` is now empty.\n  - **Enemy Head:** `(2, 7)`\n  - **Enemy Body:** The tail moved; the body now includes `(3, 7)` and stretches towards `(4, 7)`.\n- **Apples:** The apple at `(0, 7)` remains (I didn't reach it).\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (My Turn 38 Move)**\nMy head is at `(0, 6)`. My body segments are strictly below me in the column `(0, y)` for `y <= 5`, and scattered to the right in columns 1-3.\nPossible moves:\n- **DOWN to `(0, 5)`**: Valid. This cell is now part of my body (the segment immediately after the head moved up). **Wait**, actually, looking at the body list: `[(0, 5), ...]`. Yes, `(0, 5)` is occupied by my body. Moving here would be suicide. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT to `(-1, 6)`**: Out of bounds. **Invalid**.\n- **UP to `(0, 7)`**: Valid.\n  - Board state: `(0, 7)` contains an apple (`A`).\n  - Body check: My body is at `(0, 5)` and lower. `(0, 7)` is empty of my body.\n  - Enemy check: Enemy head is at `(2, 7)`. Enemy body is at `(3, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6), ...`. `(0, 7)` is not occupied by the enemy.\n  - **Safe and grabs an apple.**\n- **RIGHT to `(1, 6)`**: Valid.\n  - Board state: `(1, 6)` is currently empty (`.`).\n  - Body check: My body is at `(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2), ...`. `(1, 6)` is not in my body list. Safe.\n  - Enemy check: Enemy head is at `(2, 7)`. Enemy body is at `(2, 6), (1, 6), ...`. **(1, 6) is occupied by the enemy's body!**\n  - If I move `(1, 6)`, I hit the enemy's body. I die. **Invalid**.\n\n**2. Strategic Decision**\n- **Option UP (`(0, 7)`):**\n  - **Growth:** I eat an apple (+1 segment, +1 score). My tail will not move (I grow), so my body will lengthen into `(0, 6)`.\n  - **Safety:** The enemy is at `(2, 7)`. The distance between my head `(0, 7)` and enemy head `(2, 7)` is 2 cells (Manhattan distance). This is safe from a head-on collision this turn, as heads can only move 1 cell.\n  - **Positioning:** I am at the edge of the board. The enemy is approaching from the right (column 2). By eating the apple at `(0, 7)`, I claim the resource and continue to \"hug\" the left wall. This forces the enemy to travel further to engage me.\n- **Option RIGHT (`(1, 6)`):**\n  - **Lethal:** Moves directly into the enemy's body. Dead.\n\n**3. Long-term Plan**\n- **Current Score:** 13 vs 18. I am behind.\n- **Strategy:** Continue hugging the left wall to force the enemy to cross the board to attack or compete for apples. The left wall provides safety on my left side.\n- **Next Moves:** After eating at `(0, 7)`, I will likely need to move UP to `(0, 8)` or RIGHT to `(1, 7)` next turn. I must anticipate the enemy's movement. The enemy is currently at `(2, 7)`. If the enemy moves UP to `(2, 8)` or RIGHT to `(3, 7)`, they are not an immediate threat to my position at `(0, 7)`.\n- **Goal:** Reach 30 apples or outlast the opponent. I need to close the 5-point gap. Eating available apples on the left edge is crucial.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove UP to `(0, 7)` to eat the apple. This is the only safe move that also yields a point. Hitting the enemy's body at `(1, 6)` is strictly forbidden.\n\nUP",

My body is now `[(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1)]`.\n  - **Enemy Head:** `(1, 7)`\n  - **Enemy Body:** The tail moved; the body now includes `(2, 7)` and stretches towards `(3, 7)`.\n- **Apples:** I ate the apple at `(0, 7)`. My score is now 15. Enemy score is 18.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (My Turn 39 Move)**\nMy head is at `(0, 7)`. My body segments are strictly below me in the column `(0, y)` for `y <= 6`, and scattered to the right in columns 1-3.\nPossible moves:\n- **DOWN to `(0, 6)`**: **Deadly.** This is now occupied by my own body (the segment I just grew from). Moving here would be suicide. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT to `(-1, 7)`**: Out of bounds. **Invalid**.\n- **UP to `(0, 8)`**: Valid.\n  - Board state: `(0, 8)` is currently empty (`.`).\n  - Body check: My body is at `(0, 6)` and lower. `(0, 8)` is empty of my body.\n  - Enemy check: Enemy head is at `(1, 7)`. Enemy body is at `(2, 7), (3, 7), ...`. `(0, 8)` is not occupied by the enemy.\n  - **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT to `(1, 7)`**: Valid, but risky.\n  - Board state: `(1, 7)` is currently occupied by the **Enemy Head**.\n  - Body check: My body is not at `(1, 7)`.\n  - Enemy check: Enemy head is at `(1, 7)`.\n  - **Collision:** If I move RIGHT and the enemy stays or moves, we risk a head-on collision. Since the enemy just moved from `(2, 7)` to `(1, 7)`, they might move UP to `(1, 8)` or LEFT to `(0, 7)` or RIGHT to `(2, 7)`. If I move RIGHT to `(1, 7)`, I will collide with the enemy unless they move *out* of the way immediately.\n  - If the enemy moves UP to `(1, 8)`, I arrive at `(1, 7)` safely (empty space). But the enemy is right next to me.\n  - If the enemy moves LEFT to `(0, 7)`, we collide head-on at `(1, 7)` vs `(0, 7)`? No, they would be moving to `(0, 7)` (where I am currently). Wait, the enemy is at `(1, 7)`. If they move LEFT, they go to `(0, 7)`. I am currently at `(0, 7)`. If I move RIGHT to `(1, 7)`, we swap positions. **This is a head-on collision.** Both snakes die.\n  - If the enemy moves RIGHT to `(2, 7)`, they leave `(1, 7)` empty. I arrive at `(1, 7)` safely.\n  - **Risk:** High. The enemy could move LEFT, killing us both. Or they could move UP, placing them directly above me for a potential trap next turn.\n  - **Reward:** Potential apple at `(2, 7)`? No, `(2, 7)` is empty. I don't gain points.\n\n**2. Strategic Decision**\n- **Option UP (`(0, 8)`):**\n  - **Safety:** Very high. I am hugging the wall. The enemy is at `(1, 7)`.\n  - **Positioning:** I am moving towards the top-left corner. The enemy is below and to the right. If I go UP, I maintain distance.\n  - **Follow-up:** From `(0, 8)`, I can move UP to `(0, 9)` (top-left corner) or RIGHT to `(1, 8)`.\n- **Option RIGHT (`(1, 7)`):**\n  - **Risk:** High chance of head-on collision if enemy moves LEFT (to `(0, 7)`).\n  - **Reward:** None immediate.\n  - **Outcome:** Even if I survive, I am at `(1, 7)` with the enemy at `(1, 8)` (if they moved UP). This puts me in a tight spot with limited escape routes.\n\n**3. Long-term Plan**\n- **Current Score:** 15 vs 18. I am behind by 3 apples.\n- **Strategy:** Continue hugging the left/top wall. The enemy is at `(1, 7)`. They are likely trying to cut me off or compete for the central apples.\n- **Goal:** Survive and find a safe path to apples. The board has many apples in the center `(4-6, 3-5)`. I need to navigate there carefully.\n- **Observation:** The enemy's body is relatively long. If I can force them to crash into their own body or the wall, I win.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP to `(0, 8)` is the safest play. It keeps me away from the enemy and maintains the wall as a shield. Moving RIGHT invites a potential immediate death or a dangerous standoff. I must prioritize survival over a risky chase.\n\nUP",

It also moves me toward the lower\u2011y apple cluster (e.g., (6,5), (5,4)).  \n- RIGHT moves to (6,7); after the move only down and right remain safe, reducing future options.\n\nBecause DOWN preserves more safe future moves and pushes me toward reachable apples while avoiding any head\u2011on conflict with the enemy (whose only safe move will be upward to (0,8)), it is the best choice.\n\nPlan: Move down to approach the lower\u2011y apples, keep side options open, and avoid self\u2011collision.\n\nDOWN",

It is accessible if I can navigate through my own body.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check (Turn 40 Move):**\nMy head is at `(0, 8)`. My body segments occupy `(0, 7)` and `(0, 6)`.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT (`-1, 8`):** Out of bounds. **Invalid**.\n2.  **RIGHT (`1, 8`):**\n    - **Occupancy:** The board state shows `1 T T T T T T T T .` on row 8. The `1` represents my head at `(0, 8)`. The `T` at `(1, 8)` represents a **Enemy Body Segment**.\n    - **Risk:** Moving into the enemy's body kills me instantly.\n    - **Status:** **Unsafe**.\n3.  **UP (`0, 9`):**\n    - **Occupancy:** Row 9 is `. . . . . . . . T T .`. `(0, 9)` is `.` (empty).\n    - **Body Check:** My body is at `(0, 7)`. `(0, 9)` is not occupied by my body.\n    - **Safety:** **Safe**. I can move to the top-left corner.\n4.  **DOWN (`0, 7`):**\n    - **Occupancy:** This is currently my own neck.\n    - **Rule:** Moving backwards into the cell directly behind the head is suicide.\n    - **Status:** **Unsafe** (Suicide).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- **Immediate Move:** I must move **UP** to `(0, 9)` to survive. This places me in the corner, securing my immediate safety.\n- **Long-term Target:** The apple at `(1, 4)`.\n    - **Path Planning:** From `(0, 9)`, I will eventually need to reach `(1, 4)`.\n    - **Obstacle:** My own body currently blocks the direct path `(0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> ... -> (0, 2)`.\n    - **Requirement:** To reach `(1, 4)`, I must wait for my body to \"slough off\" or move in a way that opens the path. Specifically, I need to reach a state where I can move to `(0, 4)`.\n    - **Current Blockage:** The segment at `(0, 3)` is part of the chain. If I move `UP` to `(0, 9)`, my tail will move from `(0, 2)` to `(0, 1)`.\n    - **Future Opportunity:** By staying at `(0, 9)` or moving `(0, 9) -> (0, 8)` on subsequent turns, I can keep my head near the top while my body extends downwards. Once my head is at `(0, 9)` and the body chain is `(0, 8), (0, 7), ... (0, 3)`, the segment at `(0, 2)` will eventually detach (tail moves).\n    - **Critical Path:** To get to `(1, 4)`, I will likely need to:\n        1.  Wait for the tail to pass `(0, 3)`.\n        2.  Move to `(0, 4)`.\n        3.  Move `RIGHT` to `(1, 4)` and eat.\n- **Enemy Status:** The enemy is at `(5, 6)`. They are moving towards the center apples. By securing the top-left and waiting for my path to clear, I avoid confrontation and prepare to snag the apple at `(1, 4)`, which seems safer than competing in the center immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **UP** to `(0, 9)`. This is the only safe move. It secures my survival for the turn and positions me to eventually access the apple at `(1, 4)` once my body moves out of the way.\n\nUP",

My body occupies `(0, 8)` directly below me.\nPossible moves:\n1.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds. **Invalid**.\n2.  **UP:** Out of bounds. **Invalid**.\n3.  **RIGHT (`1, 9`):**\n    - **Occupancy:** Board state row 9 is `9 1 . . . . . . T T .` (Wait, looking at the board state provided: `9 1 . . . . . . T T .`). This row interpretation seems slightly off or misaligned in the text, but the provided list of coordinates for Snake #0's body includes `(8, 9)` and `(7, 9)`.\n    - **Risks:**\n        - **Enemy Body:** The enemy body list includes `(1, 8)`, `(2, 8)`, etc. Checking `(1, 9)`: The enemy body list does *not* explicitly list `(1, 9)`. However, the visual board shows a `T` at the end of row 9. Given the enemy's movement pattern, `1, 9` might be safe.\n        - **Head-on Collision:** This is the critical risk. The enemy head is at `(5, 5)`. To collide with me at `(1, 9)`, the enemy would need to move UP to `(5, 6)` and then UP AGAIN to `(5, 7)`, but `1, 9` is the destination. No. If I move to `(1, 9)`, the enemy must move to `(1, 9)` to kill me. The enemy is at `(5, 5)`. The distance is 4 X units and 4 Y units. The enemy would need to move diagonally, which is impossible. The enemy cannot reach `(1, 9)` in one turn. **RIGHT is Safe from head-on collision.**\n    - **Body Check:** My body is `(0, 8)...`. `(1, 9)` is not occupied by my body.\n    - **Status:** **Safe** (assuming `(1, 9)` is not an enemy body segment).\n4.  **DOWN (`0, 8`):**\n    - **Occupancy:** This is my neck.\n    - **Status:** **Unsafe** (Suicide).\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n- **RIGHT (`1, 9`):**\n    - Moves me away from my body tail.\n    - Opens up the top row for maneuvering.\n    - Moves me closer to the right side apples (e.g., `(6, 5)`) by 1 unit, but more importantly, it allows me to eventually drop down to the central area.\n    - **Crucially:** It allows me to avoid being trapped in the corner. If I stay at `(0, 9)` or move `DOWN`, I am on the left wall. Moving RIGHT gives me space.\n- **Strategic Targeting:**\n    - My primary target is still the apple at `(1, 4)`.\n    - To reach `(1, 4)` from `(1, 9)`, I need to go DOWN 5 times. My body is currently trailing down the left side `(0, 8)` to `(0, 3)`. By moving RIGHT to `(1, 9)`, I am moving *orthogonal* to my body blockage. This is good. It means I can start looping around my own body or moving down once the space clears.\n    - If I move `RIGHT` to `(1, 9)`, my tail will move from `(1, 2)` to `(0, 2)` (based on the previous turn's tail info).\n    - The enemy is at `(5, 5)`. They are likely going for the central apples `(6, 5)`, `(7, 5)`, etc. By moving to the top right or center-top, I might be moving towards them, but `1, 9` is far enough away for now.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to `(1, 9)`.\n1. It is safe (not out of bounds, not into my body).\n2. It avoids the enemy (enemy cannot reach `(1, 9)` this turn).\n3. It provides mobility. Being in the corner `(0, 9)` is a dead end. `(1, 9)` allows movement to `(2, 9)` or down to `(1, 8)`.\n4. It positions me to eventually move down towards the apple at `(1, 4)` or intercept apples in the top-right quadrant (e.g., `(9, 4)`) if the opportunity arises.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to `(1, 9)` to escape the corner. From here, I will need to navigate around my own body which occupies the left side column. The gap between my head and the nearest \"hole\" in my body (around `(0, 4)`) is currently blocked by my own segments. I need to wait for my tail to advance or find a path through the center/top. The apple at `(1, 4)` remains a priority, but I must ensure I don't trap myself by moving into the center too early while the enemy is active.\n\nRIGHT",

The board grid shows `.` at `(1, 9)` (the `1` refers to my ID, not an apple, and `.` indicates empty space).\nMy body is at `(0, 9)`, `(0, 8)`, etc.\nEnemy is far away at `(6, 5)`.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1.  **UP:** Out of bounds (y=10). **Invalid**.\n2.  **LEFT (`0, 9`):**\n    -   **Target Cell:** `(0, 9)`.\n    -   **Occupancy:** This cell is currently my tail (first segment of my body list).\n    -   **Rule:** Moving into your own body is death. Even if the tail moves (which it will, since we are growing by eating an apple), the game logic checks collision against the body state *before* the tail moves. Or simply, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    -   **Verdict:** **Unsafe**. It is strictly forbidden to reverse into the immediate segment behind the head.\n3.  **RIGHT (`2, 9`):**\n    -   **Target Cell:** `(2, 9)`.\n    -   **Visual Check:** Row 9 is `. 1 . . . . . T T .`. The cell `(2, 9)` is a `.` (empty).\n    -   **Body Check:** My body occupies `(0, 9)`, `(0, 8)...`. `(2, 9)` is not in my body.\n    -   **Enemy Check:** Enemy is at `(6, 5)`.

Moving right towards the top-right corner is a valid maneuver to avoid immediate confrontation while keeping options open to descend later.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to `(2, 9)`. From there, I will assess the path down the right side. I must watch for the enemy's movement towards `(6, 5)` and the potential clash over apples in the center/right.

          "rationale": "Based on the analysis of the current game state, here is my reasoning for the next move:\n\n**1. Current Position Analysis:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 9)\n- **My Body:** The tail is at (3, 2). Because I ate an apple on the previous turn, my body length will increase by 1 segment this turn. This means the current tail (3, 2) will remain occupied, and a new segment will be added behind my current head (3, 9) in the next turn's body list. This effectively makes my current body (including the growing tail) a critical factor for collision safety, especially in crowded areas.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (5, 4), Body length is significant (21 apples eaten). The enemy is currently in the lower center of the board.\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves from (3, 9):**\n\n*   **UP:** (3, 10) - Out of bounds. **Unsafe**.\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 8)\n    *   **Visual Board Check:** Row 8 shows `T T T T T T T T T .`. At x=3, there is a `T` (part of Snake #0's body).\n    *   **Occupancy Check:** (3, 8) is occupied by the enemy body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Unsafe**.\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 9)\n    *   **Body Check:** (2, 9) is the cell I just moved from. Moving backwards into the cell immediately behind the head is strictly forbidden and results in death.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Unsafe**.\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 9)\n    *   **Board Check:** Row 9 is `T T 1 . . . . T T .` (where 1 is at x=2). At x=4, the board shows `.` (empty).\n    *   **Body Check:** My body occupies x=0 to 2 on row 9, and lower down. (4, 9) is not in my body.\n    *   **Enemy Body Check:** The enemy body on row 9 occupies x=0 and x=1. The next enemy segment is at x=8 and x=9. (4, 9) is clear.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Safe**.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nThe only mechanically safe move is **RIGHT** to (4, 9).\n\n*   **Long-term Safety:** Moving right keeps me along the top edge. While this reduces my vertical maneuvering space (y=9 is the wall), it keeps me away from the dense enemy body in the lower-left quadrant and my own body trailing below.\n*   **Future Options:** From (4, 9), moving RIGHT to (5, 9) and (6, 9) are potential paths. The top-right corner (x=9) has an apple at (9, 5). By moving right now, I position myself to potentially drop down later or sweep the top edge. Staying at (3, 9) offers no forward path (blocked down) and moving left is suicide.\n*   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is at (5, 4) and is unlikely to reach the top row (y=9) in one turn, especially since they are likely moving toward apples or other territory. We are safely separated for the moment.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 9). This avoids immediate death by walls, own body, or enemy body. From here, I will continue moving RIGHT along the top edge to clear the distance from the left side of the board, allowing me to eventually drop down into the right-side quadrant where apples like (9, 5) and (8, 4) are located.\n\nRIGHT",

My body occupies a significant portion of the left and top sides of the board, specifically occupying the entire column x=0 from y=9 down to y=3, and a segment across the top at (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9). The enemy snake #0 has its head at (5, 2) and a large body that blocks the bottom center and right side of the board.\n\nI must choose a move for turn 46. I will evaluate the four possible directions:\n\n1.  **UP:** Moving to (5, 10) would exceed the y-axis limit of 9. This move is **invalid** and results in death.\n2.  **DOWN:** Moving to (5, 8). Looking at the board state, row 8 (y=8) at x=5 is marked 'T'. The enemy snake #0's body list confirms (5, 8) is part of its body. Moving here would cause a collision. This move is **lethal**.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving to (4, 9). My previous move was from (4, 9) to (5, 9) (Right). The rules state that moving directly backwards into the cell immediately behind the head counts as hitting my own body. (4, 9) is currently the second element in my body list. Moving there would be fatal. This move is **lethal**.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moving to (6, 9).\n    *   **Boundary:** x=6 is within the 0-9 range.\n    *   **My Body:** My body currently occupies (0,9) through (4,9) and (0,8) etc. (6, 9) is not in my body.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** The enemy body occupies (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9). (6, 9) is not in the enemy body.\n    *   **Outcome:** This move is safe.\n\nMy last move was RIGHT, and I am currently at the top edge of the board (y=9). Moving RIGHT along the top edge keeps me in open space and away from the enemy snake, which is currently active in the lower half of the board. Moving RIGHT aligns with my previous direction, maintaining momentum.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "I am currently at (6, 9) after moving right on the previous turn. I need to evaluate my four possible moves for turn 47: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP:** Moving to (6, 10). This is outside the valid Y range (0-9). This move is invalid and lethal.\n2.  **DOWN:** Moving to (6, 8).\n    *   Checking the board state and enemy snake #0's body: Enemy snake #0 has a segment at (6, 8).\n    *   Moving down would result in a collision with the enemy snake's body. This move is lethal.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moving to (5, 9).\n    *   Checking my own body: My body list is `[(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), ...]`. The second segment of my body is (5, 9).\n    *   Moving left would move my head directly into the segment currently behind it. This is moving backwards into my own body. This move is lethal.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moving to (7, 9).\n    *   **Boundary:** x=7 is within 0-9.\n    *   **My Body:** My body occupies x=0-5 at y=9, and the left side. (7, 9) is not in my body.\n    *   **Enemy Body:** Enemy snake #0 occupies (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9). Wait, looking at the enemy body list: `..., (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)`. Enemy segment (7, 9) is present.\n    *   **Collision:** Moving right to (7, 9) would hit the enemy snake's body.\n    *   **Result:** This move is lethal.\n\nAll immediate moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) appear to be lethal based on the current board state and my previous position.\n- UP is out of bounds.\n- DOWN hits enemy (6, 8).\n- LEFT hits self (5, 9).\n- RIGHT hits enemy (7, 9).\n\nHowever, I must choose a move. The prompt asks me to \"Outwit him and outlast him\" and \"Think very hard\".\nIn previous turns, I survived situations that looked impossible (e.g., moving into a cell occupied by the enemy head when they moved out, or the enemy died).\nGiven the constraints:\n- I cannot go UP (die off board).\n- I cannot go LEFT (die to self).\n- I cannot go RIGHT (die to enemy).\n- I cannot go DOWN (die to enemy).\n\nThere is no valid move that guarantees survival based on the static board state.\nHowever, I must pick one. I will evaluate the *risk*.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,9) is blocked by enemy.\n- Moving DOWN to (6,8) is blocked by enemy.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,9) is blocked by self.\n\nIf I am forced to choose a death move, I should try to move in a way that maximizes the chance of the enemy colliding with me or dying (e.g., head-on collision). But since I am moving into a body segment, it's usually a standard death.\n\nLet's re-read the board state carefully.\nEnemy Head at (5,1). Enemy Body includes (5,2)... (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9).\nMy Head at (6,9).\nMy Body includes (5,9).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (7,9):\nI hit enemy body (7,9). I die.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (6,8):\nI hit enemy body (6,8). I die.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (5,9):\nI hit my own body (5,9). I die.\nIf I move **UP**:\nI die.\n\nI am in a checkmate state.\nHowever, looking at the \"Last Move\" info, I was at (5,9) and moved RIGHT to (6,9).\nThe enemy head is at (5,1).\nPerhaps the enemy will die or move?\nBut I must make a move now.\nWait, is there any move that *doesn't* immediately kill me?\n- Left: Hits my body. Immediate death.\n- Right: Hits enemy body. Immediate death.\n- Down: Hits enemy body. Immediate death.\n- Up: Hits wall. Immediate death.\n\nI am forced to choose a move. I will choose **RIGHT**.\nWhy? In the event that the enemy snake dies *simultaneously* (e.g. hits a wall or its own body), my move might result in a win if I am the last survivor, or at least a draw. But the logic holds that I will likely die.\nHowever, if the enemy head moves into (6,9) (my current position) and I move to (7,9) (enemy body), I die anyway.\nIf the enemy head moves into (6,9) and I stay (not an option), or move elsewhere.\n\nLet's look at the apples. There is an apple at (8,4). I am far away.\nI am trapped in the top right corner.\nEnemy is at bottom left.\nGiven the constraints, I must pick a direction. I will stick with RIGHT as it maintains the trajectory towards the right side of the board, although I will likely crash into the enemy body.\n\nActually, looking at the board state again:\nRow 9: `T T T T T T 1 T T .`\nMy head is at index 6 (the `1`).\nIndex 7 is `T` (Enemy body).\nIndex 5 is `T` (My body).\nThere is no safe move.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** I am trapped. I need to survive. I will move RIGHT. If the enemy moves out of (7,9), I survive. If the enemy dies, I survive. If I die, I die.\n\nMy last move was RIGHT.\nCurrent position: (6, 9).\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (6, 10) -> Wall -> Death.\n- DOWN: (6, 8) -> Enemy Body -> Death.\n- LEFT: (5, 9) -> My Body -> Death.\n- RIGHT: (7, 9) -> Enemy Body -> Death.\n\nAll moves result in death. I must choose one. I will choose RIGHT.\n\n**Wait**, is there any other interpretation?\nThe enemy body at (7,9) is a tail segment?\n`..., (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)`.\nIf the enemy head is at (5,1), the distance is large.\nIt is impossible to survive this turn based on the provided state.\nHowever, in previous turns, I have seen the enemy die.\nIf the enemy dies, its body disappears.\nIf the enemy dies *before* I move into it, (7,9) becomes empty.\nSo, moving RIGHT is the only move that offers a chance of survival *if* the enemy dies.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT. Hope the enemy dies or moves. If I survive, I will be at (7,9).\n\nOne word output: RIGHT.\n\nDouble check coordinates:\nMy head (6,9).\nRight -> (7,9).\nEnemy body (7,9).\nIf enemy moves head away, and the tail leaves (7,9), I survive.\nIf enemy hits a wall or dies, I survive.\nIf enemy stays or grows, I die.\nMoving LEFT hits my own body (5,9). That is certain death regardless of enemy actions (unless I grow, but I haven't eaten yet this turn).\nMoving DOWN hits (6,8) (Enemy body). Certain death.\nMoving UP hits wall. Certain death.\n\nRIGHT is the only move with a *potential* survival outcome (if enemy dies).\n\nI will output RIGHT.",
