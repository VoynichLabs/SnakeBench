Moving up would take me closer to it, which could be risky.\n3. **Potential Moves**:\n   - **UP**: To (9, 3). Safe, but not toward any apples.\n   - **DOWN**: To (9, 1). Safe, but not toward any apples.\n   - **LEFT**: To (8, 2). Safe, heading toward the apple at (7, 7).\n   - **RIGHT**: Not possible, as I\u2019m already at the right edge of the board (x=9).\n\n### Strategy:\n- I want to move toward the closest apple to grow and gain points.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 2) seems like the best option, as it takes me closer to the apple at (7, 7) and avoids the enemy snake.\n\n### Next Move:\n**LEFT**"

There are apples at (7, 8), (5, 7), (3, 0), (0, 5), and (7, 7). I'll prioritize the closest ones. The closest apple to me is at (7, 7), but I need to be careful because there's another snake (#1) at (9, 2) with no body, which means it's not a threat yet, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (7, 7) while keeping an eye on the other snakes, especially #1.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible moves.
