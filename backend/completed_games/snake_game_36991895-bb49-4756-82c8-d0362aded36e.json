Safe, but no apple is directly above.\n   - **DOWN**: Moves to (0, 4). Safe, and could be a step towards the apple at (0, 2).\n   - **LEFT**: Moves to (-1, 5). Invalid move (outside the board).\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves to (1, 5). Safe, but not directly towards any apple.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Short-Term Goal**: Move towards the nearest apple to gain points.\n- **Long-Term Goal**: Avoid colliding with walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (0, 4) seems like a good step towards the apple at (0, 2). This move is safe and aligns with the strategy of targeting the closest apple.\n\n### Next Move:\n**DOWN**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn**: Continue moving towards the apple at (0, 2) while ensuring no immediate threats are present.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

We should avoid moving towards this area.\n- **Reaching Apples**: The closest apples are at (5, 4), (7, 3), (8, 4), (0, 2), and (3, 3). We should aim to move towards these apples while avoiding the enemy and walls.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the immediate danger of moving DOWN and the need to avoid the enemy, moving UP seems like the safest and most strategic move. It keeps us away from the enemy and doesn't put us in immediate danger. Moving UP will also bring us closer to the apple at (8, 4).\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP to (8, 8), I should consider moving LEFT to get closer to the apple at (8, 4). I should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's position to avoid any potential threats.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"
