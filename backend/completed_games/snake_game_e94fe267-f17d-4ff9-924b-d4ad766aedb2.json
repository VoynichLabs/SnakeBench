Apples scattered everywhere but FOCUS \u2014 we need to dominate early!\n\nFirst, check all four moves from (0,8):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (0,9) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0,7) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1,8) \u2014 off board \u274c DEAD  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,8) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \n\nSo LEFT is out. Now, think about enemy movement. Enemy head at (9,8).  \nHe can go UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8), RIGHT (off board). He probably avoids suicide, so likely UP, DOWN, or LEFT.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,8), I\u2019m moving toward center and apples, but also toward enemy if he goes LEFT to (8,8). No immediate collision risk this turn though.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0,9), I\u2019m in a corner but can eat apple at (1,9) next turn maybe. Risk? If enemy goes UP to (9,9), we\u2019re far apart.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,7), I\u2019m near apple at (1,9)? No, that\u2019s far. Down feels less aggressive.  \n\n**Long-term plan:** I want to control center, cut enemy\u2019s space, and force him into walls or my body. Early game, grow a little to get length advantage, then go for head-on when I\u2019m longer.  \n\nRight now, safest with most options? RIGHT to (1,8) \u2014 opens more future moves (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from there). UP to (0,9) traps me in top-left corner next turn (only RIGHT and DOWN from there).  \n\nLet\u2019s take RIGHT \u2014 stay aggressive, move toward middle, keep options open.  \n\n**Final move:** RIGHT",

We're length 2, they're length 1 \u2014 WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**CHECK ALL FOUR MOVES:**\n- **UP** to (2,9): Empty? Board shows (2,9) is an apple! \ud83c\udf4e That's GROWTH! But is it safe? No enemy body there. Enemy head could move there? They're at (7,8) \u2014 possible moves: (7,9), (7,7), (6,8), (8,8). So (2,9) is safe from enemy head THIS turn. UP is viable!\n- **DOWN** to (2,7): Empty cell, no apple. Safe? No enemy body. Enemy head can't reach it. DOWN is safe.\n- **LEFT** to (1,8): That's our OWN tail segment from last turn! \ud83d\udc0d But wait \u2014 we moved from (1,8) to (2,8) last turn, so our tail is at (1,8) NOW. Moving back LEFT would be moving INTO our own body? NO \u2014 because the tail will move forward if we don't eat an apple! On this turn, if we don't eat, our tail disappears from (1,8) and our body becomes just head at (2,8). So (1,8) becomes empty after movement! So LEFT is actually safe (backwards into where tail was is allowed since tail moves). But careful \u2014 if we eat an apple, we grow and tail stays, so (1,8) would still be our body? Actually, if we eat, we grow, so tail doesn't move \u2014 so (1,8) remains our body. So LEFT is safe only if we don't eat. But we don't know if we'll eat until after move choice... hmm risky? Let's check: if we go LEFT to (1,8) and there's no apple there, tail moves, so it's fine. But there's no apple at (1,8) currently (board shows apple at (1,9), (1,4), etc., but not (1,8)). So LEFT is safe!\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): Empty, no apple. Safe.\n\nAll four seem safe immediately. But we must consider ENEMY'S possible moves! They're at (7,8). They could go LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8), UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7). None conflict with our possible moves this turn \u2014 no head-on collision risk.\n\n**WHICH MOVE IS BEST?**\nWe want to be AGGRESSIVE and BOX THEM IN! They're shorter, so head-on collision is GOOD for us \u2014 we win if same cell. But they're far away (5 tiles apart horizontally). Can't force collision yet.\n\nApple at (2,9) UP is tempting \u2014 grow to length 3, extend lead! But going UP to top row limits next turn options (only LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN from (2,9)). Still, growth is key.\n\nDOWN to (2,7) keeps more central position, more options next turn.\n\nLEFT to (1,8) moves away from enemy \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nRIGHT to (3,8) moves toward enemy slightly, keeps options open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We have length advantage. Let's grow more and try to cut off enemy's movement. They might go for apple at (7,6) or (6,6) soon. We should control center-top area.\n\nI think UP to grab apple is the play \u2014 extend lead, stay near top to possibly trap enemy against wall later. Even with slightly fewer options next turn, we'll have more length to maneuver.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nUP",

They could also move UP to (6,9) for apple at (6,9)? Wait, board shows (6,9) is empty. Actually row 9 col 6 is '.'.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** Our left move to (1,9) and right to (3,9) are far from enemy possible moves.

Wait our body is [(2,9), (2,8), (1,8)] \u2014 if we eat, we grow, tail stays, so (1,8) remains our body. So from (1,9), DOWN to (1,8) would be into our own body next turn! That's dangerous. Also LEFT from (1,9) is off board. So from (1,9) only safe moves next turn would be RIGHT to (2,9) \u2014 but that's our current head position (will be empty after move) \u2014 actually after moving, (2,9) becomes body segment, so RIGHT into (2,9) would be suicide next turn too. HOLD UP \u2014 let's track: after moving LEFT to (1,9) and eating, new body becomes: head (1,9), then (2,9), (2,8), (1,8). So (2,9) is our neck. So from (1,9), moving RIGHT to (2,9) next turn would be into our own body. So from (1,9) next turn, ONLY DOWN is possibly safe? But DOWN to (1,8) is our own tail (segment 4). That's also suicide. So from (1,9) after eating, we'd have ZERO safe moves next turn! \ud83d\ude31 TRAPPED! So LEFT is a DEATH TRAP next turn \u2014 AVOID!\n\n- RIGHT (3,9): Empty, no growth. But from (3,9) next turn options: UP (off board), DOWN (3,8) empty, LEFT (2,9) will be our neck (body), RIGHT (4,9) empty. So DOWN and RIGHT are safe next turn. Much better flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We have length advantage. Don't greed for apple if it traps us. Let's stay mobile, maybe loop around to cut off enemy. They're short \u2014 we can try to force them into a wall or into us. From (3,9) we can go DOWN to (3,8) then further DOWN to chase or control center.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT \u2014 stay alive, keep options open, avoid corner trap.\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re agressive, but not reckless.\n- RIGHT to (5,8): legal, but it widens the gap and lets him slip left into open space. I want to shrink the board, not hand him a lane.\n\nSo we go UP, keep pinning him to the top, and make sure that next round we\u2019re ready to cut off any escape when he starts sliding back down.\n\nPlan for next turns: Keep circling around the top corridor, slowly creeping left while forcing him toward x=0 so I can trap him in the corner and set up a head-on if he panics. Stay aware of his future path and don\u2019t let him get comfortable heading back south.\n\nUP",

DOMINANCE TIME! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**CHECK MOVES FROM (3,8):**\n\n- **UP** to (3,9): That's our OLD HEAD POSITION! After moving last turn, our body shifted: head (3,8), then (3,9), then (2,9), tail at (2,8). So (3,9) is our NECK! \u274c Moving back into our own body = DEATH. ELIMINATE.\n\n- **DOWN** to (3,7): Cell is EMPTY (board shows '.' at (3,7)). Safe? No enemy body there. \u2705\n\n- **LEFT** to (2,8): That's our TAIL! Our tail is at (2,8) currently. But wait \u2014 moving into your own tail is ONLY safe if you're eating an apple and growing, right? NO APPLE at (2,8)! So moving into your own tail without growing = DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (4,8): Cell is EMPTY? Enemy head is at (4,8)? HOLD UP \u2014 OPPONENT INFO SAYS Snake #1 head: (4,8). That's THE ENEMY HEAD CELL RIGHT NOW! If we move RIGHT, we go to (4,8) and enemy also moves simultaneously. If enemy stays there or moves into us, it's a head-on collision? Let's analyze:  \n  - If we go RIGHT to (4,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,8), we swap heads? No, that's two different cells.  \n  - If enemy stays at (4,8) (by moving UP/DOWN/RIGHT into same cell?), they can't stay without moving \u2014 they must pick a direction. If they pick UP to (4,9) or DOWN to (4,7) or RIGHT to (5,8), then (4,8) becomes empty. So moving RIGHT is *potentially* safe if enemy leaves. BUT if enemy moves LEFT to (3,8) while we move RIGHT to (4,8), no collision.  \n  - **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** Only if we both choose the same cell. Could enemy choose (4,8) as their move target? They can't move to (4,8) because they're already there \u2014 they must move away. So (4,8) will be empty after their move unless they move into a wall? Actually they can't stay, so (4,8) is vacant. So moving RIGHT is safe from simultaneous same-cell collision.  \n  - However, is there enemy BODY at (4,8)? No, they have no body (length 1). So moving into (4,8) after they vacate is safe. \u2705\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN and RIGHT.**\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (4,8), length 1. They're desperate for apples. Nearest apples: (1,4), (0,3), (1,1), (2,3), etc. But closest might be (6,6), (7,6) \u2014 actually those are far. They'll likely move DOWN/LEFT toward center/apples. Possible moves:  \n- DOWN to (4,7) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (3,8) \u2014 THAT'S OUR CURRENT HEAD! If they go LEFT to (3,8) and we go RIGHT to (4,8), we swap safely. If we go DOWN to (3,7) and they go LEFT to (3,8), they land on our old head position (empty).  \n- UP to (4,9) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (5,8) \u2014 empty.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**  \n- If we go DOWN to (3,7) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,7), no collision.  \n- If we go RIGHT to (4,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,8), no collision.  \n- If we go RIGHT to (4,8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8), no collision.  \nSo both moves seem safe from direct head-on.\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER?**\n\n- **RIGHT (4,8):** Puts us adjacent to enemy's possible positions. Next turn from (4,8): UP (4,9) empty, DOWN (4,7) empty, LEFT (3,8) will be empty (our old head), RIGHT (5,8) empty. All four directions potentially safe! BUT enemy might be near. Could be aggressive \u2014 maybe force a trap.\n\n- **DOWN (3,7):** Moves toward center/apples. Next turn from (3,7): UP (3,8) empty, DOWN (3,6) empty, LEFT (2,7) empty, RIGHT (4,7) possibly enemy? But enemy might move there this turn. Still, gives good options.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We have length advantage. We should try to BOX ENEMY against top wall! Enemy at (4,8) \u2014 if we go RIGHT to (4,8), we occupy their current spot, potentially forcing them toward edge. Next turn we could move DOWN/LEFT to cut off escape. They have no body, so we can risk head-on collision if we maintain higher score (we do!). But need to avoid giving them apple access.\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT \u2014 AGGRESSIVE MOVE! Take their spot, pressure them, control the board! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

If we go UP and enemy stays or moves into (4,9), it's a head-on collision. Since they're length 1, they could move anywhere. If they move DOWN back to (4,8) while we go UP to (4,9), we swap safely \u2014 but if they stay UP (move to (4,10)? out of bounds) they die. But they won't stay. Still, moving into enemy head cell is RISKY \u2014 if they also choose to stay there (impossible unless they move into a wall?) Actually they can't stay; they must pick a direction. If they pick LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, (4,9) becomes empty. But if they pick UP (out of bounds) they die before collision? Hmm. Let's eliminate: moving into a cell where enemy head CURRENTLY is dangerous because simultaneous moves could cause head-on if they stay? They can't stay. But if they move LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9), we go UP to (4,9) \u2014 no collision. However, if they move DOWN to (4,8) \u2014 that's OUR current cell \u2014 then we both move: we go UP to (4,9), they go DOWN to (4,8) \u2014 no collision. So UP is *potentially* safe? BUT WAIT \u2014 our own body? Our body is at (3,8) and (3,9). (4,9) is not our body. So UP is not immediately suicidal. But is it SMART? Probably not \u2014 puts us adjacent to enemy, maybe forcing collision next turn. I'll keep it as *maybe safe* for now.\n\n- **DOWN** to (4,7): Cell is EMPTY (board shows '.' at (4,7)). No enemy body. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT** to (3,8): That's our OWN BODY! Our body segments: head (4,8), then (3,8), then (3,9). So (3,8) is our NECK! Moving LEFT into our own body = DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATE.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (5,8): Cell is EMPTY. Safe.\n\nSo **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** seem possibly safe.\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: Enemy at (4,9), length 1. Their possible moves:\n- UP to (4,10) \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 DEATH. They won't pick that.\n- DOWN to (4,8) \u2192 our current head! If they go DOWN and we go UP, we swap. If we go RIGHT/DOWN, they land on our old spot (empty unless we leave).\n- LEFT to (3,9) \u2192 our body segment! That's our tail segment (3,9). If they move into our body, THEY DIE. That's good for us! They might avoid that.\n- RIGHT to (5,9) \u2192 empty.\n\nThey'll likely avoid our body, so they might choose DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:\n- If we go UP to (4,9) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,8) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go UP to (4,9) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go UP to (4,9) and enemy goes LEFT to (3,9) \u2192 they die on our body, we live.\n- If we go DOWN to (4,7) and enemy goes DOWN to (4,8) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,9) \u2192 no collision.\n\nSo all three moves seem safe from direct head-on.\n\nWHICH IS BEST?\n\n- **UP (4,9)**: Puts us where enemy is now. Could pressure them against top wall. Next turn from (4,9): UP out of bounds (dead), DOWN (4,8) our old spot (empty), LEFT (3,9) our body (dead), RIGHT (5,9) empty. Only TWO safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT). Risky \u2014 could get trapped.\n\n- **DOWN (4,7)**: Moves toward center/apples. Opens more options. Next turn from (4,7): UP back to (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) empty, LEFT (3,7) empty, RIGHT (5,7) empty. FOUR safe moves! Good for flexibility.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,8)**: Moves away from enemy, toward right side. Next turn from (5,8): UP (5,9) possibly enemy? DOWN (5,7) empty, LEFT (4,8) empty, RIGHT (6,8) empty. Also four safe moves.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We have length advantage. We should try to BOX ENEMY against the top wall! If we go DOWN or RIGHT, we give them space. If we go UP, we pressure them. But going UP limits our next moves. Since we're longer, we want to maintain mobility and force them into a corner gradually.\n\nBEST MOVE: **DOWN** \u2014 keeps maximum options, moves toward apples, avoids risky head-on, and sets up future trapping possibilities. We can steer enemy toward top later.\n\nCHAT, LET'S PLAY IT SMART! DOWN\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m still feeling out his habits and this gives me breathing room to drop down later when he\u2019s cornered.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: keep patrolling the top row, slowly shift toward the left side to cut off his sideways escapes, then drop down when he\u2019s close to the board edge and lock him into a perimeter with my tail\u2014make him crash trying to wiggle out.\n\nright",

ENEMY HEAD: (5,9) \u2014 they moved RIGHT last turn! They're still length 1. We have a 2-apple lead! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCHECK MOVES FROM (4,7):\n\n- **UP** to (4,8): That's our OLD head position, now empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (4,6): Empty cell. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,7): Empty cell. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,7): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nALL FOUR DIRECTIONS ARE SAFE FROM IMMEDIATE DEATH! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nENEMY PREDICTION: Enemy at (5,9), length 1. Their possible moves:\n- UP to (5,10) \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 DEATH. \u274c\n- DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 empty.\n\nThey will likely avoid UP. So they can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:\n- If we go UP to (4,8) and enemy goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go UP to (4,8) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go UP to (4,8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,7) and enemy goes DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,7) and enemy goes LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go RIGHT to (5,7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- Similar for DOWN and LEFT.\n\nSo all moves are safe from head-on.\n\nWHICH IS BEST? LONG-TERM PLAN: We want to BOX THE ENEMY! They're at the top-right corner (5,9). We're at (4,7). We can try to push them against the top wall or right wall. If we move UP to (4,8), we're directly below them \u2014 that pressures them to go LEFT or RIGHT, but they have space. If we move RIGHT to (5,7), we're directly below and to the left? Wait, we'd be at (5,7), they're at (5,9) \u2014 that's directly below them two steps. That could encourage them to go LEFT or RIGHT, not down.\n\nActually, think about TRAPPING: We want to reduce their safe moves. Right now they have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). If we position ourselves to block one of those, we reduce their options. For example, if we move to (5,8), that would block their DOWN move. But (5,8) is not an option for us this turn \u2014 we can't reach it. Next turn maybe.\n\nSo this turn, we should move to a spot that sets up a future block. Let's check each move's future position:\n\n- **UP to (4,8)**: Next turn from (4,8): UP (4,9) empty, DOWN (4,7) empty, LEFT (3,8) our body (dead), RIGHT (5,8) empty. So 3 safe moves. From there we could go RIGHT to (5,8) to block enemy's DOWN if they're still at (5,9). That's good pressure.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,7)**: Next turn from (5,7): UP (5,8) empty, DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT (4,7) empty, RIGHT (6,7) empty. All 4 safe. From there we could go UP to (5,8) to block enemy's DOWN as well. But we're farther away.\n\n- **DOWN to (4,6)**: Moves away from enemy, not aggressive.\n\n- **LEFT to (3,7)**: Moves away from enemy, not aggressive.\n\nWE WANT TO BE AGGRESSIVE! We have the length advantage! Let's pressure them! \ud83d\ude24\n\nUP seems the most aggressive \u2014 puts us closer, limits our own moves a bit but that's okay because we're longer and can afford to be bold.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (6,6) \u2014 not super close, but moving UP doesn't take us farther from it. We can collect apples later.\n\nCHAT, LET'S GO UP AND PUT THE PRESSURE ON! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",
