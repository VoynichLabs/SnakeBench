My head at (9,6), enemy head at (8,9).  \n\nFirst, check safe moves:  \n- **UP** \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 empty, on board \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,5) \u2014 has an apple, but safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board (x=10) \u274c DEAD  \n\nSo RIGHT is out.  \n\nNow, enemy is at (8,9). He can move DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), or UP off board (dead), RIGHT off board (dead). So he\u2019ll likely go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nIf I go UP to (9,7), he could go LEFT to (7,9) \u2014 no collision risk yet.  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,5), I eat an apple immediately \u2014 but that grows me, making my body longer early. Could be good for score advantage, but also limits future mobility a bit.  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,6), I\u2019m moving toward center, more options next turn.  \n\nLong-term plan:  \nWe want to box him in near the top-right corner. He\u2019s at (8,9) now \u2014 if I can get between him and the center, I can trap him. Eating an apple now gives me length advantage for head-on collisions later. But early game, maybe better to stay nimble and cut off his escape.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s think: If I go LEFT to (8,6), next turn I can move UP toward him or continue cutting off. But going DOWN to (9,5) grabs an apple and still leaves me near the bottom-right \u2014 not really boxing him yet.  \n\nHmm\u2026 I think early aggression: take the apple, get longer, then use length to threaten head-on collisions when I have more segments.  \n\nBut also, if I eat apple, my tail grows next turn \u2014 so my body will be at (9,6) and (9,5) after moving. That could block my own movement in the corner. Risky?  \n\nChat, what do you think? \ud83e\udd14  \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward **LEFT** to (8,6) \u2014 central position, more flexibility, sets up to cut off his path down from (8,9).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** Move toward (8,7) or (7,6) to pressure him from below/left, force him toward wall.  \n\nLEFT",

Who\u2019s ready to see a snakey chokehold? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick situational read:\n- Our head: (8,9). Opponent head: (9,6). Both snakes are length 1 (no bodies to crash into yet).\n- Apples near us: (8,8) right below, (9,9) to the right-up corner, (9,8) just one further down-right.\n- Board edges matter \u2014 moving into the corner reduces escape routes. Let\u2019s not get boxed first move.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud):\n- UP \u2192 would go to (8,10) which is off the board. Instant death. No thanks. \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (9,9). Legal and grabs an apple immediately, but that\u2019s the top-right corner (x=9 edge). Grabbing that apple sacrifices some mobility (fewer follow-up escapes) and may let the opponent bounce around behind us. Risky for long-term boxing. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 to (7,9). Safe, keeps central space, but passes up an immediate apple. Slower aggression. \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN \u2192 to (8,8). Safe, grabs an apple right now, keeps us away from the corner, and leaves multiple follow-up options (L/R/D) on the next turn. This also keeps pressure toward the cluster at (9,8)/(9,9) and lets us contest space without getting pinned. \u2705\n\nSafety check vs opponent: Opp at (9,6) can\u2019t force a head-on into (8,8) this turn. No simultaneous-head collision risk if we go DOWN. Good.\n\nShort-term plan (keep this for next-turn rationale):\n- Grab the apple at (8,8) now to gain the scoring edge.\n- Next turn, avoid going back up (would be into our body). Choose between RIGHT to contest (9,8)/(9,9) apples or LEFT/DOWN to maintain mobility depending on opponent\u2019s approach. Force them toward the bottom/right corner while we control the central lane.\n\nAlright fam \u2014 we eat first and stay flexible.

We need to close the gap and pressure him!\n\nFirst, check safe moves from (8,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 empty \u2705\n\nAll four moves are safe! No walls, no bodies. Good.\n\nNow, enemy head at (8,8). His possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 his own body \u274c DEAD\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 has an apple \u2705\n\nHe will avoid UP (suicide). He might go for the apple at (9,8) or move DOWN/LEFT to avoid risk.\n\nOur goal: trap him in the top-right. If we move UP to (8,7), we block his DOWN path. That forces him LEFT or RIGHT. If he goes RIGHT to (9,8), he eats apple and grows \u2014 not ideal since he already has a length advantage. If we move LEFT to (7,6), we're not directly pressuring him. If we move RIGHT to (9,6), we're staying in the right column but not cutting him off.\n\nActually, think about head-on collision risk: If we go UP to (8,7) and he goes DOWN to (8,7), we both die. He has length 2, we have length 1 \u2014 he wins on apples if we both die! So we **cannot** risk head-on when he has more apples. We need to avoid same-cell moves unless we have equal or greater length.\n\nSo UP is risky if he chooses DOWN. How likely is he to go DOWN? He might, to avoid the wall. But he could also go for the apple at (9,8). Hmm.\n\nWhat about DOWN to (8,5)? That moves us away, gives space but loses pressure. Not aggressive enough.\n\nLEFT to (7,6) \u2014 central, safe, but not boxing him.\n\nRIGHT to (9,6) \u2014 puts us directly below (9,8) where the apple is. If he goes RIGHT to (9,8), he's above us. Next turn we could move UP to (9,7) and block him from going DOWN. That could trap him against the top wall.\n\nI like that! Move RIGHT to (9,6). Then next turn, if he's at (9,8), we go UP to (9,7) \u2014 he can only go LEFT to (8,8) or UP off board (dead). We're longer? No, we're still shorter, but we're cutting off his escape downward.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if we go RIGHT now, and he goes DOWN to (8,7), he's moving away. That's fine \u2014 we can chase.\n\nActually, let's think about the board: He's in the top-right corner with limited moves. We want to approach from below/left to limit his options. RIGHT puts us directly below him in the same column. That's good for vertical pressure.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9,6), if he's at (9,8), go UP to (9,7) to block. If he's elsewhere, move to cut off his path to center.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT to (9,6) \u2014 aggressive positioning, sets up a vertical pin, avoids immediate head-on risk (since he likely won't go DOWN to (8,7) if we're not there).\n\nChat, let's lock it in! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent head at (8,6), apples clustered to our right/top (9,8) and (9,9). Score: we 1 \u2014 him 0. Time to be aggressive but not suicidal.\n\nMove check:\n- UP \u2192 into (8,9) = our body (backwards). Dead. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 to (8,7). Can FORCE a head-on if he plays UP from (8,6) (double KO \u2192 we win since we have more apples). High-risk/high-reward, but opponent can simply avoid. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT \u2192 to (7,8). Safe, keeps options, but punts immediate pressure and apples. Neutral play. \ud83e\udd14\n- RIGHT \u2192 to (9,8).

Eating now on the right both increases our win leverage and keeps us in an aggressive posture to box him into the bottom/right. Opponent cannot kill us immediately by moving into (9,8) this turn.\n\nPlan (next few turns): grab (9,8) now, then threaten (9,9) or cut off his escape by holding column 9 and forcing him into the lower corridor. If he ever commits toward us, force a head-on when our apple lead is larger to secure the round.\n\nRIGHT",

He\u2019s LONGER, so we can\u2019t risk head-on collision unless we have equal or greater length.\n\nFirst, check safe moves from (9,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,5) \u2014 has an apple \ud83c\udf4e but also safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board \u274c DEAD  \n\nSo RIGHT is out. Good.\n\nNow, enemy head at (9,8). His possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 apple there \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u274c  \n\nSo he can only go UP or DOWN. If he goes UP, he eats apple and grows to length 4. If he goes DOWN, he goes to (9,7).\n\nWe want to pressure him without dying. If we go UP to (9,7) and he goes DOWN to (9,7), head-on collision \u2014 we both die, he wins on apples. That\u2019s BAD. So UP is risky unless we think he\u2019ll go UP.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (9,5), we eat an apple, grow to length 2, but move away from him \u2014 gives him space. Not aggressive enough.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (8,6), we stay safe, keep distance, but we\u2019re not directly boxing him.\n\nThink long-term: He\u2019s trapped in the right column with his body blocking LEFT. If he goes UP to (9,9), he\u2019s in the top-right corner with only DOWN and LEFT next turn (RIGHT and UP off board, LEFT into his body if he grows). That\u2019s a potential trap.\n\nOur move: **LEFT to (8,6)**. Why?  \n- It\u2019s safe.  \n- It keeps us close but not in direct vertical line, avoiding immediate head-on risk.  \n- Next turn, if he\u2019s at (9,9), we can move UP to (8,7) or (9,6) to cut off his DOWN escape.  \n- If he goes DOWN to (9,7) this turn, we\u2019re at (8,6) \u2014 we can go UP to (8,7) to block him from going LEFT, or RIGHT to (9,6) to stay close.  \n\nWe avoid the apple at (9,5) for now because growing isn\u2019t the priority \u2014 trapping him is. We need to equalize length before taking risks.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,6), assess his position. If he\u2019s at (9,9), move to (8,7) or (9,6) to limit his moves. If he\u2019s at (9,7), consider moving to (8,7) to block leftward escape. Keep closing the net!\n\nChat, we\u2019re playing the long game \u2014 don\u2019t get greedy, don\u2019t get dead. Let\u2019s box this guy! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Body directly behind at (8,8) \u2192 LEFT is backwards into ourselves (DEAD). RIGHT is off-board (DEAD). UP \u2192 (9,9) has an apple. DOWN \u2192 (9,7) is empty but invites an immediate head-on if opponent goes UP from (9,6).\n\nMove viability:\n- LEFT = suicide into our body \u274c\n- RIGHT = off-board \u274c\n- DOWN = legal, aggressive. If he plays UP we both collide at (9,7) \u2192 double KO, but we\u2019d win because we have more apples now (2 vs 0). Risky because opponent can avoid by taking (9,5) apple or stepping aside. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP = legal, eats (9,9) \u2192 increases our lead to 3-0, grows us, locks the top-right column and gives us stronger leverage to force head-ons later while staying safe this turn. \u2705\n\nDecision: take the apple, secure the lead, and maintain control of column 9. We want to ratchet pressure, not gamble on a willing double-KO. Short-term plan: after eating, hold column 9 and threaten moves DOWN to bait him into committing; force head-on later when we have a larger margin or trap him into the lower corridor.

He's LONGER (length 4 vs our 1), so head-on collision is INSTANT DEATH for us. Gotta play smart!\n\nFirst, check safe moves from (8,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nAll four moves are safe! Good.\n\nNow, enemy head at (9,9). His possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u274c  \n\nWAIT \u2014 he has NO safe moves! \ud83d\ude31 He's TRAPPED in the corner! Next turn, he MUST crash unless an apple spawns there (but apples don't spawn under snakes). He's DEAD next turn if nothing changes! That means we just need to survive this turn and avoid moving into his possible death spot? Actually, he has zero legal moves \u2014 so he'll die at the start of next turn. But we must survive THIS turn without accidentally killing ourselves.\n\nBut careful \u2014 apples can't save him because he'd need to move onto one. He can't move anywhere. So he's dead next turn unless... wait, could he go backwards? No, backwards is into his own body at (9,8) \u2014 that's death. Yep, he's cooked.\n\nSo our goal: survive, don't give him a chance to survive by us dying first. Also, avoid moving to (9,9) because if by some miracle he goes RIGHT (off board) and we go RIGHT to (9,6) then UP to (9,7) then RIGHT? No, irrelevant.\n\nActually, we should also consider: if we move RIGHT to (9,6), we're adjacent to his body at (9,8) and (8,8). That's fine.\n\nBut the real threat: if we move UP to (8,7), we're close but safe. DOWN to (8,5) is safe. LEFT to (7,6) is safe.\n\nLong-term plan: He's dead next turn, so we just need to not die this turn. Also, maybe grab an apple to start growing for future? But apples are at (9,5), (8,4), etc. DOWN to (8,5) gets us closer to (8,4) apple next turn. RIGHT to (9,6) then next turn DOWN to (9,5) gets apple.\n\nBut no need to rush \u2014 surviving is winning. Safest move? Probably LEFT to (7,6) \u2014 maximizes distance from his corner, avoids any accidental head-on if somehow he magically escapes (he can't). But also keeps options open.\n\nActually, all moves are safe. Let's pick one that sets up apple grab next turn while staying safe. DOWN to (8,5) \u2192 next turn can go DOWN to (8,4) for apple, or LEFT/RIGHT. That's good.\n\nChat, we've got this! He's boxed himself! Let's not throw. We'll take a safe move toward an apple to start growing after he's dead.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** Enemy will be dead. Then we focus on eating apples and expanding. From (8,5), we can go DOWN to (8,4) for apple, or explore left side. Keep building length!\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019ve got the lead 3\u20130 \u2014 we can play aggressive and punish him if he tries to squeeze past us. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udca5\n\nQuick legal-move check (HEAD = 9,9):\n- UP \u2192 off-board (dead) \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board (dead) \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) is directly behind us (backwards into our neck) \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) is currently our tail cell. Tail will vacate this turn (we\u2019re not guaranteed to eat on this move), so LEFT is the only safe/legal option \u2705\n\nTactical read on the opponent (head at 8,6, no body): he\u2019s two\u2013three cells below our row and has to climb to challenge the top corridor. If we move LEFT into (8,9) we instantly lock the top-right corner across x=8\u20139: our body will occupy (8,9),(9,9),(9,8),(8,8) (tail movement considered), making it very awkward for him to pass up through x=8 without suiciding into our body. With our apple lead, we can invite a head-on later and win that trade.\n\nImmediate risks:\n- If he rushes UP to (8,7) this turn, he\u2019s still far from stabbing into our head. He would need to try to step into our occupied cells later (which kills him) or loop around and attempt to outmaneuver us \u2014 we\u2019re longer now, so we control the choke.\n- We must avoid getting funneled into a narrow corridor; after LEFT we should prefer moves that maintain space (try to snake DOWN along x=8 or slide back toward the center only when safe).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- LEFT now into the tail (safe). Then press DOWN along column 8 to deny vertical escape and keep him trapped below. Use our length and apple advantage to threaten a head-on when he gets desperate. Keep options open \u2014 don\u2019t commit into a one-cell wide trap unless we can force a kill.\n\nLet\u2019s lock the top-right and start the squeeze.

Decent choke, but it narrows our immediate follow-ups (we\u2019d mainly have DOWN or LEFT next turn).\n- DOWN moves into our tail cell (safe) and advances us toward the enemy (head at 7,6). That closes distance faster, preserves multiple escape/attack options (we can continue DOWN to pressure, or swing LEFT to box), and follows our prior plan to press the column below and force him into tight choices. We\u2019re ahead on apples \u2014 if he gets desperate we can force a head-on later and win the trade. \ud83d\ude08\n\nRisks:\n- No immediate collision risk this turn (opponent can\u2019t reach (8,8) simultaneously). Watch for him trying to climb up column 7; keep cutting off his vertical escape. Don\u2019t get funneled into a 1-cell corridor without an exit.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN now into the vacated tail at (8,8). Then continue to descend (column 8) to hem him in, threatening a head-on when he tries to breach upward. Maintain at least two open moves each turn; only commit to tight traps when we can secure the kill. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s at (8,9) with body at (9,9), (9,8), (8,8). That\u2019s different! Did he move last turn? Let\u2019s check: last turn his head was (9,9), body (9,8),(8,8),(8,9). Now head (8,9), body (9,9),(9,8),(8,8). That means last turn he moved LEFT from (9,9) to (8,9) \u2014 but that was into his own body at (8,9)?? Wait, that\u2019s impossible unless\u2026 OH! The board shows his body list as [(9,9), (9,8), (8,8)] \u2014 that\u2019s head to tail. So his head is (8,9), then segment 2 is (9,9), segment 3 is (9,8), tail is (8,8). That means he moved LEFT from (9,9) to (8,9) last turn \u2014 but (8,9) was his tail last turn! He ate an apple! Yes \u2014 because his length stayed 4, but he moved into his own tail cell after the tail moved forward. That\u2019s allowed if he ate an apple! So an apple must have spawned at (8,9) last turn. That saved him from being trapped! \ud83d\ude32\n\nSo now he\u2019s at (8,9), body behind him. He has 3 apples (now 4? Wait scoreboard says 3 apples \u2014 hmm maybe apple count updates after growth? Actually scoreboard says Snake #1 apples: 3. So maybe he didn\u2019t eat? But his body didn\u2019t shrink\u2026 Let\u2019s check: last turn his body length was 4 (head + 3 body). Now still 4. If he moved into an apple, he\u2019d grow to 5. But he didn\u2019t. So maybe the board display is just showing his body from head to tail differently? Let\u2019s trace: last turn head (9,9), body (9,8),(8,8),(8,9). If he moved LEFT to (8,9), that\u2019s his own tail \u2014 normally that\u2019s safe if tail moves away. But tail was at (8,9) last turn, so when he moves into it, tail moves to (8,8)? Wait, then new body: head (8,9), old head (9,9) becomes body segment 1, old body (9,8) becomes segment 2, old body (8,8) becomes segment 3, tail gone? That\u2019s length 4 still. Yes! So he didn\u2019t eat, just moved into his tail\u2019s old position. That\u2019s legal! So he\u2019s alive!\n\nOkay, so enemy is alive and has 4 length vs our 1. Head-on collision = we die. He\u2019s in top row near right corner.\n\nOur head: (7,6). Safe moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \n\nAll safe.\n\nNow predict his moves from (8,9):\n\nUP \u2192 off board \u274c  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \n\nSo his only safe move is LEFT to (7,9).\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,6), we\u2019re far from him. If we go UP to (7,7), still safe. DOWN/LEFT also safe.\n\nBut think ahead: if he goes LEFT to (7,9), next turn he could go DOWN to (7,8) or LEFT to (6,9). We want to avoid being in his path when he\u2019s longer.\n\nWe need to grow ASAP. Apples at (9,5), (8,4), (4,7), (1,8), (5,3), etc. Closest is (8,4) \u2014 2 steps away if we go DOWN then DOWN. Or (9,5) if we go RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nBut careful: going RIGHT to (8,6) then next turn DOWN to (8,5) then DOWN to (8,4) gets apple in 2 turns. Going DOWN now to (7,5) then DOWN to (7,4) then RIGHT to (8,4) in 3 turns.\n\nWe also want to avoid boxing ourselves. With length 1, we have room.\n\nLet\u2019s check head-on risk this turn: he\u2019s moving LEFT to (7,9). We won\u2019t be near that.\n\nSo all moves safe. Pick one that gets us toward apples while keeping options open.\n\nI like RIGHT to (8,6) \u2014 closer to right-side apples (9,5) and (8,4), and away from his path down from top row.\n\nNext turn from (8,6), we can go DOWN to (8,5) toward apple at (9,5) or (8,4).\n\nChat, we\u2019re playing the long game \u2014 he\u2019s longer, so avoid him, grow, then fight when we\u2019re equal or longer.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward bottom-right apple cluster, grow to length >1, monitor enemy\u2019s movement from top-left. Keep distance until we can threaten head-on.\n\nRIGHT",

He has 3 apples, we have 0. We need to GROW but also watch his moves!\n\n**Immediate safe moves from (8,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 empty \u2705  \nAll four are safe this turn.\n\n**Predict enemy moves from (8,8):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 his own body \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c  \nSo he can go DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf he goes DOWN to (8,7), he's one step closer to us. If he goes LEFT to (7,8), he's moving toward center.\n\nWe want to avoid head-on collision \u2014 he's longer, so we lose if we crash. We also want to get apples ASAP.\n\nClosest apples:  \n(9,5) \u2014 2 moves away if we go DOWN then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN.  \n(8,4) \u2014 3 moves away.  \n(6,3) \u2014 farther.\n\n**If we go RIGHT to (9,6):**  \nPuts us on right edge, next turn only LEFT, UP, DOWN safe. Could go DOWN to (9,5) for apple next turn if enemy isn't there. Risky if enemy moves DOWN then RIGHT toward (9,7)? But he's at (8,8) now, not an immediate threat.\n\n**If we go DOWN to (8,5):**  \nPuts us closer to (9,5) and (8,4). Next turn from (8,5) we can go RIGHT to (9,5) for apple, or DOWN to (8,4). More options.\n\n**If we go LEFT to (7,6):**  \nMoves away from apples, but maybe sets up to go toward (6,3) later? Not optimal for quick growth.\n\n**If we go UP to (8,7):**  \nDANGER \u2014 if enemy goes DOWN to (8,7) same turn, HEAD-ON COLLISION \u2014 we both die, he wins on apples. So UP is risky! We can't guarantee he won't go DOWN.\n\nSo ELIMINATE UP \u2014 too risky with his possible DOWN move.\n\n**Between DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT:**  \nLEFT moves away from apples.  \nRIGHT and DOWN both move toward apples.  \nRIGHT to (9,6) limits next turn moves (edge).  \nDOWN to (8,5) keeps more options (can go RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT next turn).\n\nAlso, if enemy goes LEFT to (7,8), he's moving away from us. If he goes DOWN to (8,7), he's closer but we're at (8,5) \u2014 still safe distance.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGrow quickly to match his length. Target apple at (9,5) next turn if safe. Monitor enemy path \u2014 if he keeps moving down left side, we can dominate right side and bottom. Avoid being pinned against wall. Once we have 2-3 apples, look for opportunities to cut off his escape or force a head-on when we're longer.\n\nChat, I'm thinking **DOWN** to (8,5) \u2014 safe, progresses toward apples, keeps options open, avoids collision risk this turn.

He's ABOVE us.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFE MOVES FROM (8,5):**\n- UP \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4) \u2014 empty \u2705 (apple at (8,4) next turn if we go there!)\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) \u2014 empty \u2705 (apple at (9,5)!)\n\nAll four are safe this turn.\n\n**PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (8,7):**\nHe can go:\n- UP \u2192 (8,8) \u2014 his own body \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 empty \u2705\n\nSo he has DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT as safe.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**\nIf we go UP to (8,6) and he goes DOWN to (8,6) \u2192 DOUBLE KO, he wins on apples. RISKY.\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,5) and he goes DOWN to (8,6) then RIGHT to (9,6)? Not same turn collision.\nIf we go LEFT/DOWN, no same-cell risk this turn.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nClosest apples: (9,5) one move RIGHT, (8,4) one move DOWN. We can grab one THIS TURN if we move there! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**If we go RIGHT to (9,5):**\nWe eat apple, grow to length 2. Next turn head at (9,5) \u2014 but we're on right edge! Only safe moves likely LEFT, UP, DOWN (but UP (9,6) empty, DOWN (9,4) empty). Could be okay, but edge limits options.\n\n**If we go DOWN to (8,4):**\nWe eat apple, grow to length 2. Next turn head at (8,4) \u2014 more central, options UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Better flexibility.\n\n**If we go LEFT/UP:**\nNo apple this turn, fall behind in growth.\n\n**ENEMY INTENT:**\nHe might go for apple at (9,5)? From (8,7) to (9,5) is two moves. He might go RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6) then LEFT to (9,5)? Not immediate.\nHe might go for (8,4)? He'd need DOWN to (8,6), DOWN to (8,5), DOWN to (8,4) \u2014 three moves.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe NEED apples to match his length. Once we're longer, we can pressure him. Right now, avoid risky head-on. Grabbing an apple now is TOP PRIORITY.\n\nChoosing between (9,5) and (8,4):\n- (9,5) puts us on edge next turn \u2014 riskier if he approaches.\n- (8,4) keeps us more open, near other apples (7,3), (6,3) etc.\n\nAlso, if we go RIGHT to (9,5), and enemy goes DOWN to (8,6), he's closer to us next turn. If we go DOWN to (8,4), he's farther.\n\nChat, I think **DOWN** to (8,4) is the move \u2014 eat apple, stay central, avoid edge trap, reduce collision risk. Let's GROW and then hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Pushing RIGHT pins the enemy toward the x=9 wall and threatens the apple at (9,5).

LEFT is conservative and keeps options, but doesn\u2019t create as much immediate pressure. RIGHT gives the best chance to reduce their escape room quickly.  \n- Follow-ups: from (9,6) we can pivot DOWN to pressure (9,5) next turn or drop to (9,7) to corral them against the wall. We keep multiple escape squares open (we\u2019re not cornering ourselves into a dead-end yet).\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Pin to the right wall: move RIGHT now to (9,6). Next turn, if they head toward (9,4) to go for (9,5), go DOWN to contest and try to force a head-on where we win by apples. If they evade left or down, pivot quickly (LEFT/DOWN) to cut off escape routes and squeeze them into tighter space. Grow when safe; kill when possible.

From 8,5 next turn we can go UP or DOWN to corral them, or continue LEFT to chase apples. Going DOWN to 9,4 pins us to the wall and reduces maneuverability. We want to create traps, not get trapped.  \n- Aggression: we\u2019re ahead on apples (4 vs 2). Moving into the board lets us start carving lanes and threaten a forced head-on later when we have positional advantage.  \n- Safety: LEFT is immediately safe \u2014 no simultaneous head collision possible this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (8,5) to get off the right wall and start claiming board interior.\n- Then pivot DOWN/LEFT to cut off eastward exits and shepherd the opponent toward the lower-left apple cluster (5,3 / 6,3) where we can contest and force him into tight spaces.\n- If a head-to-head becomes available while we\u2019re ahead on apples, we take it \u2014 we win ties on surviving that way.

But careful\u2014enemy at (8,5) could move to (7,5) or (8,4) to block.\n- DOWN (7,2): Avoids apple, but opens path to (6,2) then (6,1) apple. Less aggressive.\n- RIGHT (8,3): Moves toward enemy, risky. Could go to (8,2) or (9,3) later.\n\nENEMY INTENT:\nHe's longer, he might try to pressure us. If he goes LEFT to (8,5), he's closer to cutting off our access to top apples. We need to grow FAST and maybe loop around to trap HIM.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN:\nEAT THE APPLE AT (6,3) NOW. Grow to 4. Then aim for (5,3) apple next to grow to 5\u2014MATCH HIS LENGTH! Once we're equal length, we can force head-on collisions if we have position advantage. Use our body to wall off the bottom-left.

We want board control and to keep lots of follow-up options.\n- LEFT moves us closer to the enemy without cornering ourselves and preserves 3 safe follow-ups (vs only 2 from UP). That keeps us flexible to box them later while avoiding being trapped against our own body.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns \u2014 put this in your replay notes):\n- Move LEFT now to (6,5) to increase pressure and keep many escape options.\n- From there, pivot depending on their approach: if they wander up, shimmy to their side to hem them into the lower-left; if they head for apples, cut off their route and take apples safely to build a lead.\n- Avoid a head-to-head unless we get ahead in apples \u2014 trap and corral, don\u2019t trade KOs while tied.\n\nLEFT",

Want to give them space to grow unchallenged? Nah.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- LEFT to (3,7) now to start collapsing their x-space and march toward the (2,7)/(2,4) apples. Keep our spine toward the right so we always have an escape up or down. If they chase apples low, pivot to cut their path and bait a head-on while we hold the superior score.

ALL OPEN! NICE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (3,7):\n- UP \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 EMPTY \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 EMPTY \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 APPLE \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 HIS OWN BODY \u274c CAN'T GO RIGHT!\n\nHE HAS THREE SAFE MOVES TOO: UP, DOWN, LEFT. LEFT GETS HIM AN APPLE AT (2,7)!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISKS THIS TURN:\nWE MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE NEED TO CHECK IF ANY OF OUR SAFE MOVES COULD LAND ON THE SAME CELL AS ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES.\n\nOUR UP TO (2,5): ENEMY MOVES TO (3,8), (3,6), OR (2,7). NO OVERLAP. SAFE.\nOUR DOWN TO (2,3): ENEMY MOVES TO (3,8), (3,6), OR (2,7). NO OVERLAP. SAFE.\nOUR LEFT TO (1,4): ENEMY MOVES TO (3,8), (3,6), OR (2,7). NO OVERLAP. SAFE.\n\nBUT WAIT \u2014 WHAT ABOUT ENEMY MOVING INTO OUR CURRENT HEAD (2,4)? HE CAN'T REACH IT. GOOD.\n\nSTRATEGIC THINKING: \ud83e\udde0\nWE'RE TIED IN LENGTH. WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND BOX HIM IN! LOOK AT THE BOARD \u2014 ENEMY IS IN THE TOP-LEFT QUADRANT NEAR APPLES AT (2,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8). IF HE GOES LEFT TO (2,7), HE EATS AN APPLE AND GROWS TO LENGTH 7, PULLING AHEAD! WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN! \ud83d\ude24\n\nWE HAVE APPLES AT (1,5), (0,1), (0,2) NEAR US. BUT CHAT, REMEMBER THE PLAN \u2014 DOMINATE THE BOARD, NOT JUST CHASE APPLES! WE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS SPACE AND FORCE A TRAP.\n\nFROM (2,4):\n- UP TO (2,5): MOVES US CLOSER TO HIM? NOT REALLY. OPENS OPTIONS BUT KEEPS US VERTICAL.\n- DOWN TO (2,3): MOVES US AWAY FROM HIM, TOWARD BOTTOM APPLES. BUT THAT'S PASSIVE \u2014 WE YIELD THE CENTER.\n- LEFT TO (1,4): CLAIMS MORE LEFT SIDE, BLOCKING HIS POTENTIAL PATH DOWN? HE'S AT Y=7, WE'RE AT Y=4. NOT DIRECTLY BLOCKING.\n\nHMM... WHAT'S THE BIG PLAY? \ud83e\udd14\n\nENEMY LIKELY WANTS THAT APPLE AT (2,7). IF HE GOES LEFT, HE'S AT (2,7). NEXT TURN FROM (2,7), HE COULD GO DOWN TO (2,6) OR LEFT TO (1,7) FOR ANOTHER APPLE, OR UP TO (2,8) FOR APPLE. HE'LL PROBABLY CHAIN APPLES AND GROW FAST!\n\nWE NEED TO POSITION OURSELVES TO INTERCEPT OR FORCE A HEAD-ON IF WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE \u2014 BUT WE'RE TIED. SO WE NEED TO GROW TOO, SAFELY.\n\nLOOK AT APPLE (1,5) \u2014 IT'S ADJACENT TO OUR HEAD! FROM (2,4):\n- UP TO (2,5) IS ONE STEP AWAY FROM (1,5)? NO, (2,5) TO (1,5) IS LEFT, BUT THAT'S TWO STEPS.\n- LEFT TO (1,4) IS ONE STEP AWAY FROM (1,5)? YES, (1,4) TO (1,5) IS UP. NEXT TURN WE COULD GO UP TO GRAB IT IF SAFE.\n\nBUT ENEMY MIGHT ALSO BE EYEING (1,5)? HE'S FAR.\n\nSAFETY OF FOLLOW-UP MOVES:\nFROM (2,5): NEXT TURN COULD GO UP, DOWN, LEFT? CHECK BORDER/OUR BODY.\nFROM (2,3): NEXT TURN COULD GO DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? OPEN.\nFROM (1,4): NEXT TURN COULD GO UP, DOWN, LEFT? OPEN.\n\nALL HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS.\n\nDECISION TIME: I THINK LEFT TO (1,4) IS SMART! IT CLAIMS MORE TERRITORY ON THE LEFT, SETS UP FOR APPLE (1,5) NEXT TURN, AND KEEPS US FLEXIBLE. IF ENEMY GOES FOR (2,7) APPLE, HE'LL BE AT (2,7) WITH LENGTH 7. WE'LL BE AT (1,4) STILL LENGTH 6. WE NEED TO GROW ASAP TO MATCH! SO NEXT TURN WE CAN GO UP TO (1,5) FOR APPLE AND TIE AGAIN AT 7-7. THAT'S THE PLAN! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Instant suicide. NOPE. \u274c  \n- LEFT -> (1,7) = apple, free, puts us in same column as the enemy (pressure!). \u2705  \n- UP -> (2,8) = apple, also safe and gives options. \u2705  \n- DOWN -> (2,6) = safe but less aggressive and pulls toward our own body. \u2705 but less preferable.\n\nRisk check: Opponent head is at (1,4). They cannot reach (1,7) or (2,8) this turn (too far), and their RIGHT move into (2,4) is illegal (their neck). No immediate head-on risk. Good.\n\nWhy LEFT? Game sense:\n- Eats an apple immediately to extend our lead (7\u20135) \u2014 we should leverage our scoring advantage to force risky plays from them. \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa  \n- Puts us directly above the opponent in x=1 column \u2014 perfect setup to pressure them vertically and cut off escapes next few moves.  \n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (up to contest more apples at 1,8 or drop down to trap), while still avoiding self-collisions.  \n- DOWN is too passive; UP is OK, but LEFT is the more aggressive, tempo-gaining play that matches our \u201cforce the head-on when we\u2019re ahead\u201d mindset. \ud83e\udde0\u2694\ufe0f\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):  \n- Eat LEFT now and grow. Use length to control x=1/2 corridor.  \n- If they head up, block and push them toward the wall; if they head down, collapse behind them and force a collision or trap.  \n- Keep pressuring their vertical options\u2014when they overcommit, bait a head-on if we maintain the apple lead.\n\nLET\u2019S TURN THIS INTO A CLIP \u2014 LEFT",

WE GROW, SO OUR BODY BECOMES: HEAD (1,5), THEN (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) \u2014 LENGTH 7.\n\nFROM (1,5) NEXT TURN, POSSIBLE MOVES:\n- UP \u2192 (1,6) \u2014 EMPTY?

WE HAVE 5, IF WE EAT ONE WE'RE AT 6 \u2014 WAIT NO, HE'S AHEAD BY 1 APPLE STILL! MY BAD CHAT! HE'S AT 6 APPLES, WE'RE AT 5. IF WE BOTH EAT THIS TURN, HE'D BE AT 7 APPLES, WE'D BE AT 6 APPLES.

THAT'S A PROBLEM \u2014 HE'D HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE FOR HEAD-ON COLLISIONS.\n\nSO MAYBE WE NEED TO NOT JUST CHASE APPLES BUT CUT HIM OFF? BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND.\n\nLOOK AT OTHER MOVES:\n- DOWN TO (1,3): MOVES US AWAY FROM HIM AND APPLES. PASSIVE.\n- LEFT TO (0,4): CLAIMS LEFT EDGE, BUT NO APPLE.\n\nUP IS THE ONLY MOVE THAT GETS US AN APPLE THIS TURN. AND IT'S ADJACENT! WE CAN'T PASS THAT UP!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: AFTER EATING APPLE AT (1,5), WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY BOX HIM IN. HE'S IN TOP LEFT WITH MANY APPLES \u2014 WE NEED TO MOVE NORTHWEST TO BLOCK HIS PATHS. NEXT TURN FROM (1,5), CONSIDER GOING UP TO (1,6) OR LEFT TO (0,5) TO START ENCIRCLING. WE MUST FORCE A HEAD-ON WHEN WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE, BUT WE'RE BEHIND. SO PRIORITY: GROW AND MATCH HIS LENGTH, THEN OVERTAKE.\n\nENEMY LIKELY GOING FOR (1,7) OR (2,8) APPLE. IF HE GOES TO (1,7), HE'S CLOSE TO US.

Time to stay smart, stay aggressive, and keep that lead locked in. Ready to box this clown in? Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nQuick legal sweep (thinking out loud for the chat):  \n- RIGHT -> (2,7) = our neck. Instant suicide. NOPE. \u274c  \n- LEFT -> (0,7) = empty, aggressive positioning, but no apple this turn. \u2705 but less immediate value.  \n- UP -> (1,8) = apple! Immediate +1, extends our lead to 8\u20136 and gives us more leverage to force a head-on later. \u2705 BEST. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa  \n- DOWN -> (1,6) = empty and it Baits a head-on if they go up to collide (we win if both die since we have more apples) \u2014 risky bait, they can also sidestep. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nRisk assessment: Opponent head at (1,5). They cannot reach (1,8) this turn, and their DOWN move is into their neck (illegal), so their immediate options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Eating the apple at (1,8) increases our lead and reduces their incentive to take a suicide head-on now \u2014 we want to be the safer aggressor, not gamble unnecessarily.\n\nWhy I\u2019m taking UP:  \n- Instant apple = more apples = more control. Want to force head-ons when we\u2019re clearly ahead, so we should widen the gap first. \ud83c\udf4f\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6  \n- Keeps multiple follow-ups open (we can contest nearby apples and pressure their vertical corridor).  \n- Safer than baiting a risky collision this turn \u2014 baiting could work, but a guaranteed apple AND more board control is cleaner and keeps options open.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):  \n- Grab (1,8) now to push the score to 8\u20136. Pressure the x=1/x=2 corridor and threaten to collapse their options.  \n- If they try to dodge, use our extra length to box them toward the wall and set up a forced head-on when it benefits us. If they gamble into us, we happily accept the KO when the apples math favors us. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFinal move \u2014 let\u2019s eat and extend the lead. UP",

WE BOTH DIE! AND SINCE HE HAS MORE APPLES (7 vs 6), HE WINS THE ROUND IF WE BOTH DIE! THAT'S BAD! SO UP IS RISKY IF HE CHOOSES DOWN.\n\nIF WE GO LEFT TO (0,5) OR RIGHT TO (2,5), NO CHANCE OF HEAD-ON WITH HIS POSSIBLE MOVES.\n\nWHAT'S HIS LIKELY MOVE? HE'S AGGRESSIVE, SURROUNDED BY APPLES. UP TO (1,8) GETS HIM AN APPLE, GROWS TO LENGTH 9, EXTENDING HIS LEAD. DOWN TO (1,6) IS EMPTY BUT RISKY IF WE GO UP. LEFT TO (0,7) IS SAFE BUT NO APPLE. HE'LL PROBABLY GO FOR THE APPLE AT (1,8) TO PULL FURTHER AHEAD. BUT HE MIGHT ALSO GO DOWN TO CUT US OFF OR FORCE A HEAD-ON SINCE HE HAS LENGTH ADVANTAGE (8 vs 7). IF HE GOES DOWN AND WE GO UP, WE DIE AND HE WINS. SO UP IS A GAMBLE.\n\nSTRATEGIC GOAL: WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DIE. WE NEED TO GROW AND BOX HIM IN. LOOK AT APPLES NEARBY: (1,8) ABOVE HIM, (2,8) APPLE, (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) ON LEFT EDGE. WE NEED TO MANEUVER TO CUT OFF HIS ACCESS TO APPLES AND FORCE A TRAP.\n\nFROM (1,5):\n- LEFT TO (0,5): CLAIMS LEFT WALL, MOVES TOWARD BOTTOM-LEFT APPLES. NEXT TURN FROM (0,5) WE COULD GO DOWN TO (0,4) OR UP TO (0,6). SAFE AND STEADY.\n- RIGHT TO (2,5): MOVES TOWARD CENTER, MORE FLEXIBLE. NEXT TURN FROM (2,5) WE COULD GO UP TO (2,6) \u2014 WAIT (2,6) IS EMPTY? BOARD SHOWS EMPTY. THAT COULD BLOCK HIS POTENTIAL PATH DOWN FROM (1,7) IF HE GOES DOWN? BUT HE'S AT (1,7), SO (2,6) IS DIAGONAL. HMM.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE NEED TO GET BETWEEN HIM AND THE APPLES ON THE TOP/LEFT. IF HE GOES UP TO (1,8), HE'LL BE AT (1,8) NEXT TURN. WE COULD MOVE TO (0,5) THEN UP TO (0,6) THEN (0,7) TO BLOCK LEFT SIDE, OR GO RIGHT AND UP TO (2,6) THEN (1,6) TO CHALLENGE. BUT WITH LENGTH DISADVANTAGE, DIRECT CONFRONTATION IS BAD.\n\nBEST MOVE: AVOID HEAD-ON RISK. SO ELIMINATE UP. BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT, LEFT TAKES US TO THE EDGE WHERE WE CAN SAFELY GROW ON BOTTOM-LEFT APPLIES AND START WRAPPING AROUND HIM. RIGHT KEEPS US CENTRAL BUT CLOSER TO HIS BODY \u2014 RISKIER.\n\nLEFT IS SAFER AND STARTS AN ENCIRCLEMENT FROM THE WEST. LET'S GO LEFT!\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: FROM (0,5), GO DOWN TO (0,4) OR UP TO (0,6) BASED ON HIS POSITION. COLLECT APPLES AT (0,2), (0,1), (0,0) TO CATCH UP IN LENGTH. THEN MOVE NORTH TO BLOCK HIS ESCAPE. FORCE HIM INTO A TRAP WHERE WE CAN GET A HEAD-ON WITH EQUAL OR GREATER LENGTH.\n\nLEFT",

NOPE. \u274c  \n- UP -> (2,9) = empty, safe. Keeps two follow-ups (LEFT to 1,9 apple or RIGHT to 3,9). But UP is the top edge \u2014 no further UP.  \n- RIGHT -> (3,8) = apple, safe. RIGHT also leaves two good follow-ups (UP or RIGHT). Grabs content and increases our head-on leverage. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcaa\n\nOpponent (head 0,4) is forced to go DOWN to (0,3) \u2014 they cannot threaten our next cell. So no immediate head-on risk from them.\n\nWhy I PICK RIGHT:\n- Immediate apple at (3,8) = +1 apple \u2192 we go to 10 vs their 6. That makes head-on gambits tilt heavily in our favor. Big power move. \u2696\ufe0f  \n- Keeps multiple exits (UP or RIGHT) and avoids moving us into a top-edge dead-end.  \n- Moves us slightly toward center so we can start hemming their x=0 corridor while keeping escape routes. Aggressive and safe \u2014 exactly what we want.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Snag this apple and then use our length advantage to swing down along x\u22483\u21922 to pressure their column. Force them left into the wall; if they try to head-on with us now, we win the clash. Be ready to trade apples for position if it closes exits for them. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

Then pivot RIGHT along the top: (5,9) \u2192 (6,9) to chain apples.  \n- Use increased length to sweep toward center and then press left, compressing the opponent into x=0.  \n- If they gamble a head-on while we maintain higher apples, force it \u2014 we win head-on with the lead. Always watch tail movement when we\u2019re not growing so we don\u2019t self-box. \ud83d\udc40\n\nLET\u2019S SNATCH THE APPLE AND TURN UP THE HEAT \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

Best option: keeps multiple safe follow-ups (notably (6,9) apple next turn), continues our top-row pressure, and is far from the enemy head at (0,1). \u2705\n\nRisk check: Opponent head is at (0,1) \u2014 nowhere near a head-on with either LEFT or RIGHT this turn.

We\u2019re already ahead \u2014 force head-on if they try to contest center later.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns \u2014 this will show up in next replay):\n- RIGHT to (5,9) now \u2192 then (6,9) to eat the apple and grow.  \n- After growing, sweep left/down to compress the board and steer the fight toward the x=0 choke where opponent is boxed.  \n- Watch tail movement carefully when not growing so we don\u2019t self-trap; if they try to challenge a head-on while we have the higher score, force it.\n\nLET\u2019S KEEP THE PRESSURE \u2014 go get that (6,9) apple and make them sweat. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Start compressing the opponent into the x=0 corridor; if they try to charge, bait a head-on when we\u2019ve got the apples advantage. Avoid moving into (5,8) \u2014 it\u2019s a trap.\n\nRIGHT",

ENEMY IS LONGER, SO WE NEED TO CHAIN APPLES TO CATCH UP! THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE PATH TO VICTORY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF: AFTER EATING AT (4,1), AIM FOR THE (6,1)/(6,0)/(6,2) APPLE CLUSTER! MOVE RIGHT THEN DOWN/UP. WATCH ENEMY'S PATH \u2014 HE'S LIKELY HEADING DOWN RIGHT SIDE TOWARD (7,3) APPLE. WE DOMINATE LEFT/BOTTOM-MID, THEN SWING UP TO (3,6) APPLE. WHEN WE REACH LENGTH ~14, LOOK FOR HEAD-ON COLLISION IF WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! STAY FLEXIBLE, AVOID BOXING OURSELVES IN!\n\nRIGHT",

Threaten the apple at (8,7) by optionally going DOWN next turn to grow. Maintain access to the top rows (8,9 \u2192 sweep left) so we can progressively compress #0 into the left wall. If they charge, we bait a head-on when we have the apple/score advantage.

Instant death. No way. \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (8,9) is open, gives ~2 follow-ups but pushes us to the top edge where mobility tightens. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) is open, but hugs the right wall and leaves only 2 follow-ups (up or down). Risky for long-term sweep. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) is an apple and is OPEN. Moving down gives us 3 safe follow-ups (L, R, or further down), grows us to 15 apples (bigger lead), and keeps multiple escape routes. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nTactical rationale \u2014 be ruthless:\n- We\u2019re +3 apples. Growing now strengthens our head-on leverage later. Want them boxed into x=0? Keep pressure from the top & middle while maintaining escape options. Eating (8,7) increases our score and gives us more teeth to force trades when they try to break out. Do we bait a head-on now? Not yet \u2014 they\u2019re too far. Do we maximize mobility and score? Yes. \u2705\ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take (8,7) now to grow. From there, maintain lateral movement (sweep right/left as needed) while inching back up to the top row to continue compressing #0 into the left column. Keep \u22652 exit options every turn. If they commit to a head chase and we still hold lead, we can force a collision in our favor.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 DOWN",

Opp is over on the left (6,2) with a long stuck body \u2014 we want to press advantage and increase our lead so we can force a head-on later if needed. Smash the apple when safe and keep escape options.\n\nCheck all four directions:\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) is our neck / body. Instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) is open. Gives 3 follow-ups (L, U, D). Decent space, keeps center control. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) has an apple. Safe this turn, gives us +1 apple (bigger lead). After eating we\u2019ll have only UP or DOWN exits (wall to the right), but both are available. Good risk-reward \u2014 grab it. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) is open and gives the most immediate mobility (3 follow-ups). Conservative and safe. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nOpponent threat: Snake #0 is far and likely to keep churning left/center; they cannot contest the (9,6) apple this turn. Head-on consideration: we\u2019re ahead on apples (15 vs 13). Grabbing the apple makes it 16 vs 13 (+3), which makes a future head-on even safer for us if we can bait it.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Snag the apple at (9,6) to widen the lead.\n- From (9,6) use the vertical corridor (UP first) to avoid getting boxed, then funnel toward center/top-right to control lanes.\n- Keep pressure on the board center to compress #0 toward the left wall. If they try a risky breakout and we still lead, bait a head-on on our terms.\n\nTime to cash that apple and crank up the tempo. RIGHT",

NOPE. \u274c  \n- UP \u2192 (9,7) is empty and safe this turn, but after moving UP our only safe follow-up will be (9,8). (8,7) is our body and (10,7) is off-board, so UP collapses our mobility to essentially a 1-cell vertical corridor. Too limiting. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) is empty and safe. From there we retain two solid follow-ups (left into (8,5) or down into (9,4)) \u2014 more escape routes and room to maneuver. \u2705\n\nWhy DOWN? We\u2019re ahead 16\u219214 \u2014 we want to stay aggressive and keep options to pressure and compress the board, not get stuck hugging the right wall. DOWN gives us more branching moves next turn and lets us swing toward the center to cut off #0 or bait a head-on later when we dictate the terms. Also keeps us out of immediate trap against our own body.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (for your next-rationale replay): move DOWN into the center corridor, then pivot left toward x7\u2013x6 lanes to start boxing the opponent on the left wall. Maintain spacing so we can force a head-on if they try to break out while we keep the apple gap. Be ready to trade if it benefits our lead.\n\nLet\u2019s be bold \u2014 push the board and keep options open. DOWN",

NOPE. \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) is our neck / off-board in that direction? Actually RIGHT would be (9,5) which is our neck \u2192 backwards = instant death. NOPE. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,5) is empty and safe. \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,4) is empty and safe and directly challenges the enemy head at (8,3). \u2705\n\nTactical read: we\u2019re up 16 \u2192 15. The opponent\u2019s neck is at (7,3) so they CANNOT go LEFT to escape; their options from (8,3) are UP (8,4), RIGHT (9,3) or DOWN (8,2). If we drop DOWN into (8,4) we force a high-value gamble:\n- If they respond by going UP into (8,4) at the same time, that\u2019s a head-on \u2014 both die \u2014 but we win the match because we\u2019re +1 on apples. That\u2019s a WIN by smart aggression. \ud83d\ude08  \n- If they dodge (RIGHT or DOWN), we land on (8,4) with multiple escape/attack options next turn (LEFT to compress, RIGHT to flank, or DOWN to chase). That keeps our options open and continues the pressure.\n\nLong-term plan (keep this as our next rationale snapshot): force them into the narrow corridor around x=6\u2013x=8. If they try to dodge, shadow and compress \u2014 aim to cut off their escape to the left wall and bait head-on when they panic. Grow opportunistically only when it helps trap them. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe take the aggressive, board-controlling play \u2014 go for the contested center cell to force the clash while we hold the apple lead.\n\nDOWN",

NEXT TURN WE CAN FIGHT HEAD-ON! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nRIGHT TO (9,3) IS SAFE BUT DOESN'T GROW.

WE CAN CHAIN EAT AND SURPASS HIM! \ud83d\ude80\n\nBUT MUST AVOID TRAPPING OURSELVES. LET'S CHECK: AFTER EATING AT (8,2), OUR TAIL WILL MOVE FROM (1,5) TO (2,1)? WAIT, OUR BODY LENGTH 16, AFTER GROWTH TO 17, TAIL STAYS PUT? NO \u2014 WHEN WE EAT, WE GROW, SO TAIL DOESN'T MOVE NEXT TURN. SO OUR BODY BLOCKS (8,3) AND (7,3), BUT WE'LL HAVE NEW HEAD AT (8,2).

Decent, but edges reduce our escape options and it\u2019s a bit passive. \u2705 (safe)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4) = empty & safe. Pushes into the middle of the play corridor (x=6\u20138), keeps more lateral options, and helps compress the enemy from above. \u2705 (safe)\n\nTactical read:\n- Score is tied 16\u201316. Head-on now would be a mutual KO \u2192 draw. We don\u2019t want that. We should avoid a risky immediate head-on unless we pull ahead first.\n- Opponent at (8,2) can grab the apple at (9,2) by going RIGHT. Letting them freely get that apple gives them the lead and makes head-on riskier later.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,4) is the aggressive board-control play: it keeps multiple escape routes, moves us into a position to shadow and compress their corridor, and lets us react to them grabbing an apple or dodging. Right (9,4) narrows our options and punts initiative to them.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns):\n- Shadow and compress the x=6\u20138 corridor. Force them toward corners or into our trap instead of letting them run to open space or uncontested apples.\n- Avoid head-on while tied; bait them into giving us a +1 (or force a bad dodge) and only gamble on a head-on when we have the apple advantage.\n- Grow opportunistically if it helps block exits; don\u2019t chase every apple.\n\nWe go aggressive, keep options open, and box him in from above \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Safe and keeps better vertical flexibility without hugging the enemy body. \u2705\n\nTactical read (short and brutal):\n- Score: we 16, they 17. They lead by 1 \u2014 we must AVOID forcing a head-on. If we can get them to overreach or snag a contested apple later, we flip lead and then play for collision. For now: no reckless mutual-KO.  \n- Opponent options: from (8,1) they cannot go UP (neck), so they\u2019ll likely go DOWN to (8,0) apple or drift LEFT/RIGHT. We can\u2019t contest that apple this turn anyway. Don\u2019t give up mobility chasing it.  \n- LEFT pushes into the center and is aggressive, but it places us adjacent to their body at (6,3) and reduces safe downward options next turn. UP keeps multiple clean follow-ups (UP then LEFT or keep circling), and avoids getting funneled into the enemy\u2019s lower corridor.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Climb a hair (get above their plane) and then start sliding left to compress the 6\u20138 corridor from above. Keep distance so we don\u2019t collide head-on while they chase low apples.  \n- Force them to take risky moves to get apples (drop into our field of vision), then pounce once we snag a +1 and have the numerical edge.

IF WE GO LEFT TO (7,1), WE CAN NEXT MOVE UP TO (7,2) \u2014 THAT'S CLOSER TO ENEMY AND CAN START BLOCKING HIS LEFT PATH! WE HAVE A LENGTH ADVANTAGE, SO WE CAN AFFORD TO SKIP AN APPLE TO GAIN POSITION! \ud83d\udca1\n\nCHAT, THINK ABOUT THIS: ENEMY AT (7,4) CAN GO UP TO (7,5) OR LEFT TO (6,4). IF WE GO LEFT NOW TO (7,1), THEN NEXT TURN UP TO (7,2), THEN WE CAN THREATEN (7,3) OR (6,2) TO BOX HIM! HE'LL BE FORCED UP OR LEFT, AND WE CAN KEEP CUTTING OFF! IF WE EAT ANOTHER APPLE NOW, WE GROW BUT LOSE TIME \u2014 AND OUR TAIL IS AT (1,5), SO OUR BODY BLOCKS A LOT OF LEFT SIDE. WE CAN USE THAT AS A WALL!\n\nLET'S CHECK IF LEFT IS SAFE REGARDING ENEMY POSSIBLE HEAD-ON NEXT TURN: IF ENEMY GOES LEFT TO (6,4) AND WE GO LEFT TO (7,1), NO COLLISION. IF ENEMY GOES UP TO (7,5), STILL SAFE. SO LEFT IS SAFE THIS TURN.\n\nDECISION: TAKE THE POSITIONAL MOVE! LEFT TO (7,1) TO START MOVING UP AND CUT OFF ENEMY'S ESCAPE ROUTES! WE MAINTAIN LENGTH ADVANTAGE, AND WE CAN STILL EAT APPLIES LATER! THIS IS AGGRESSIVE SNAKE PLAY! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN: FROM (7,1), MOVE UP TO (7,2) TO CONTINUE ADVANCING TOWARD ENEMY, WHILE KEEPING OPTIONS TO GO TO (7,0) APPLE IF NEEDED. WATCH ENEMY'S MOVEMENT AND BE READY TO FORCE A HEAD-ON WHEN WE HAVE CLEAR LENGTH SUPERIORITY!\n\nLEFT",

Quick, ruthless read incoming.\n\nLegal-move scan from our head (7,5):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) = our own body. Instant death. \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4) = our neck. Backwards = suicide. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) = empty. Safe, aggressive, moves us toward center/lower corridor but shrinks escape options next turn. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- UP \u2192 (7,6) = empty. Safe, keeps vertical flexibility and multiple follow-ups. \u2705\n\nOpponent quick read (head (7,1), neck (8,1)):\n- They cannot go RIGHT or into their neck. Their choices are UP or DOWN. DOWN \u2192 (7,0) is an apple and very attractive. They will likely drop for that apple this turn. Good \u2014 let them chase bottom apples while we maintain pressure from above. \ud83c\udf4e\n- They currently lead by 1 apple (17 vs our 16). We should AVOID forcing a head-on until we flip the lead. No reckless mutual-KO plays.\n\nTactical choice:\n- LEFT is tempting for aggression but funnels us toward their lower body and reduces safe exits. We don\u2019t want to get boxed in while trailing by 1.\n- UP keeps multiple safe exits, preserves our mobility, and lets us climb to then slide left later to compress their space once we regain the lead. Maintain distance so a head-on would be their risk, not ours. \ud83d\ude08\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Climb up now to keep options open. If they drop for bottom apples, let them; grab a nearby apple when safe to tie or take the lead, then close the gap and force risky plays. Focus on cutting their corridor from above and avoid direct head-on until we have +1 advantage.\n\nMove: UP\n\nUP",

WE NEED TO BOX THE ENEMY! LET'S THINK: OUR BODY FORMS A HUGE WALL ON THE LEFT SIDE FROM (0,1) UP TO (0,5) AND ACROSS. ENEMY IS AT (7,5) WITH OPENINGS UP AND LEFT. IF WE EAT THE APPLE AND GROW, OUR TAIL MOVES FORWARD SLOWLY, OPENING SPACE BEHIND US. MAYBE WE CAN CIRCLE AROUND?\n\nWAIT \u2014 CHECK ENEMY'S BODY: HE HAS A LONG BODY BLOCKING TOP-RIGHT AREA. HIS HEAD IS NEAR THE MIDDLE-RIGHT. IF WE GO DOWN AND EAT, WE STAY ALIVE AND KEEP LENGTH ADVANTAGE. WE CAN THEN MOVE LEFT TO (6,0) OR RIGHT TO (8,0) AND THEN UP, EVENTUALLY WORKING AROUND TO CUT HIM OFF. BUT THAT TAKES TIME.\n\nIS THERE A WAY TO FORCE A HEAD-ON? IF WE GO UP, WE DIE NEXT TURN. SO CAN'T. SO DOWN IS THE ONLY SAFE MOVE THAT KEEPS US ALIVE! \ud83d\ude05\n\nBUT HOLD ON \u2014 ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING? LET'S DOUBLE-CHECK THE BOARD FOR (7,2) NEIGHBORS:\n- (7,3): OUR BODY (from our list: (7,3) is our 4th segment) \u2705 BLOCKED.\n- (6,2): OUR BODY (6,2 is our 6th segment) \u2705 BLOCKED.\n- (8,2): OUR BODY (8,2 is our 3rd segment) \u2705 BLOCKED.\n- (7,1): OUR BODY (our current head last turn was (8,1), then we moved left to (7,1), so (7,1) is our head now, but next turn if we move up to (7,2), then (7,1) becomes our neck \u2014 YES, (7,1) WILL BE OUR BODY NEXT TURN, BLOCKING DOWN).\n\nSO INDEED, MOVING UP TO (7,2) TRAPS US. SO UP IS **NOT** A SAFE MOVE WHEN CONSIDERING NEXT TURN'S SURVIVAL! OUR RULES SAY ELIMINATE MOVES THAT IMMEDIATELY KILL YOU \u2014 UP DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY KILL, BUT IT GUARANTEES DEATH NEXT TURN. WE MUST AVOID THAT! SO EFFECTIVELY, UP IS UNSAFE FOR STRATEGY. BUT TECHNICALLY FOR THIS TURN'S MOVE, IT'S ALLOWED. BUT CHAT, WE'RE NOT THROWING! WE PICK DOWN!\n\nDOWN TO (7,0) IT IS! EAT THAT APPLE, GROW TO 19, SCORE 18! THEN NEXT TURN WE HAVE OPTIONS! AND WE STILL HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! WE CAN RE-EVALUATE THEN! MAYBE ENEMY MOVES INTO A TRAP! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nFINAL MOVE: DOWN!

LENGTH ADVANTAGE STILL 2! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFIRST, CHECK OUR SAFE MOVES FROM (7,0):\n- **UP \u2192 (7,1)** \u2192 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c THAT'S OUR NECK! DEATH!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,-1)** \u2192 OFF BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,0)** \u2192 BOARD SHOWS 'A' \u2705 APPLE! SAFE CELL!\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,0)** \u2192 BOARD SHOWS 'A' \u2705 APPLE! SAFE CELL!\n\nTWO SAFE MOVES: LEFT AND RIGHT! BOTH ARE APPLES! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nNOW PREDICT ENEMY'S MOVE FROM (7,6) \u2014 WAIT, ENEMY HEAD IS AT (7,6) PER OPPONENT LIST! HE MOVED UP LAST TURN FROM (7,5) TO (7,6)! GOOD.\n\nENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (7,6):\n- UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2705 EMPTY!\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 HIS NECK \u274c (HIS BODY AT (7,5))\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 BOARD SHOWS '.' \u2705 EMPTY!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 HIS BODY \u274c (HIS BODY AT (8,6))\n\nENEMY HAS TWO SAFE MOVES: UP TO (7,7) OR LEFT TO (6,6).\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? IF WE GO LEFT TO (6,0) OR RIGHT TO (8,0), WE'RE FAR AWAY, NO CHANCE. SAFE.\n\nBUT STRATEGY TIME! WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! WE WANT TO BOX HIM IN AND FORCE A CRASH! LOOK AT THE BOARD: OUR BODY FORMS A MASSIVE WALL ON THE LEFT SIDE AND BOTTOM. ENEMY IS IN THE TOP-RIGHT QUADRANT. HIS ESCAPE ROUTES? HE CAN GO UP INTO MORE OPEN SPACE, OR LEFT TOWARD OUR WALL. IF WE CAN PUSH HIM INTO A CORNER, WE WIN!\n\nOUR TWO MOVES:\n- **LEFT to (6,0)**: EAT APPLE, GROW TO 20, LENGTH 20. THEN NEXT TURN FROM (6,0): UP (6,1) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (5,0) '.' \u2705, RIGHT (7,0) OUR BODY \u274c, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c. ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: LEFT! THAT'S A DEAD END NEXT TURN! \ud83d\ude31\n- **RIGHT to (8,0)**: EAT APPLE, GROW TO 20, LENGTH 20. THEN NEXT TURN FROM (8,0): UP (8,1) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (7,0) OUR BODY \u274c, RIGHT (9,0) '.' \u2705, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c. ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: RIGHT! ALSO A DEAD END NEXT TURN! \ud83d\ude31\n\nOH NO! BOTH MOVES LEAD TO A TRAP NEXT TURN! BUT WAIT \u2014 OUR TAIL IS AT (0,5) AND WILL MOVE FORWARD NEXT TURN IF WE DON'T EAT AN APPLE? HOLD UP, WE ARE EATING AN APPLE THIS TURN, SO WE GROW, OUR TAIL STAYS PUT! SO NEXT TURN, FROM (6,0) OR (8,0), WE ONLY HAVE ONE EXIT. THAT'S DANGEROUS!\n\nBUT IS THERE A WAY OUT? IF WE GO LEFT TO (6,0), NEXT TURN WE MUST GO LEFT TO (5,0). FROM (5,0): UP (5,1) OUR BODY \u274c, LEFT (4,0) '.' \u2705, RIGHT (6,0) OUR BODY \u274c, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c. AGAIN ONLY LEFT! WE'D BE STUCK MOVING LEFT ALONG THE BOTTOM ROW UNTIL WE HIT THE WALL AT (0,0), THEN DIE! THAT'S A DEATH SPIRAL! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nSIMILAR FOR RIGHT: FROM (8,0) \u2192 RIGHT TO (9,0) \u2192 THEN? FROM (9,0): UP (9,1) '.' \u2705, LEFT (8,0) BODY \u274c, RIGHT OFF BOARD \u274c, DOWN OFF BOARD \u274c. ONLY UP! THEN FROM (9,1): UP (9,2) 'A' \u2705, LEFT (8,1) BODY \u274c, RIGHT OFF BOARD \u274c, DOWN (9,0) BODY \u274c. ONLY UP! WE'D GO UP THE RIGHT EDGE. THAT GIVES MORE SPACE! SO RIGHT MIGHT OFFER AN ESCAPE ROUTE UP THE SIDE! \ud83e\udd14\n\nLET'S COMPARE:\n- LEFT: TRAPS US ON BOTTOM-LEFT, QUICK DEATH.\n- RIGHT: TRAPS US TEMPORARILY BUT ALLOWS US TO GO UP THE RIGHT WALL, INTO MORE OPEN AREA NEAR ENEMY! THAT'S BETTER!\n\nALSO, RIGHT PUTS US CLOSER TO ENEMY'S POSITION FOR FUTURE BOXING! ENEMY IS AT (7,6). IF WE GO RIGHT THEN UP, WE CAN APPROACH FROM THE RIGHT SIDE AND MAYBE CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE!\n\nWHAT ABOUT ENEMY'S MOVE? IF HE GOES UP TO (7,7), HE'S MOVING AWAY. IF HE GOES LEFT TO (6,6), HE'S MOVING TOWARD OUR WALL. WE WANT HIM TO MOVE INTO A TRAP! OUR MOVE RIGHT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH NOW.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: ANY CHANCE OF HEAD-ON? NO, WE'RE AT BOTTOM, HE'S AT TOP.\n\nSO BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT, RIGHT IS THE LESS TRAPPING MOVE AND OFFERS A PATH TOWARD ENEMY! WE TAKE RIGHT! EAT THAT APPLE, GROW TO 20, AND NEXT TURN HEAD UP THE RIGHT SIDE! THEN WE CAN TURN LEFT INTO THE TOP AND SQUEEZE HIM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: MOVE RIGHT TO (8,0), THEN UP ALONG RIGHT WALL, THEN LEFT ACROSS TOP TO CUT OFF ENEMY'S ESCAPE. USE OUR LENGTH ADVANTAGE TO BOX HIM IN THE TOP-RIGHT CORNER. FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHEN WE HAVE LONGER LENGTH! STAY AGGRESSIVE!\n\nRIGHT",

Next-step options: LEFT (4,6), UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5) \u2014 gives 3 clean follow-ups and keeps more open space to maneuver. \u2705\n\nWhy LEFT? We\u2019re down 16\u219219, so we don\u2019t want to gamble on a head-on. LEFT preserves the most mobility, keeps us able to pivot and start compressing the mid/left area, and avoids any tight funnel into our own packed top-right body. We\u2019ll use that extra freedom to circle and slowly pressure the enemy\u2019s lower corridor \u2014 force them into committing to bottom apples while we control the middle lanes.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take LEFT now to keep options open.\n- Use the extra space to move around their top of the lower corridor, aim to cut off their retreat into central columns when they commit further down.\n- Only force a head-on if we can flip the apple gap to our favor by +1 before contact.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it clean and box him in \u2014 fans demand blood, but smart blood. \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

Low wiggle room. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- LEFT -> (4,5): legal and roomy \u2014 open to (4,6),(3,5),(4,4). Good lateral options to squeeze space. \ud83d\udc4d\n- DOWN -> (5,4): legal and roomy \u2014 opens to (5,3) apple, (4,4),(6,4). Gives immediate apple opportunity next turn and keeps multiple escapes. \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n\nOpponent head = (9,1). Their legal moves are essentially UP to (9,2) (there\u2019s an apple at 9,2), so they\u2019ll go that way and then likely continue up the right edge. No immediate head-on threat to us this turn.\n\nWe\u2019re down on apples 16 \u2192 19. We should not force a head-on now. We need to GROW to close the gap and then apply pressure. So preference: keep options open, go after reachable apples, and start compressing their escape lanes later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Drop DOWN to (5,4) now, then take (5,3) apple next turn to get to 17.\n- Use the extra length to dominate central/lower lanes, then pivot toward the right corridor to hem the enemy in once we\u2019ve closed the apple gap. Don\u2019t trade heads until apples are favorable. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLet\u2019s take the safe aggressive line \u2014 press center, grab apples, keep mobility.\n\nDOWN",

Avoid forcing a head-on while trailing.\n\nDecision logic (short):\n- LEFT gives maximum maneuverability, but no immediate apple.\n- UP is more cramped (one side blocked by our own body).\n- DOWN is the aggressive, high-value play: it positions us to take (4,2) next turn and threatens nearby apples (5,3 / 2,3) while still leaving multiple escape options (3,3 / 5,3 / down to apple). Since opponent can\u2019t contest quickly, we should press the apple advantage and grow to start boxing them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 drop this into the replay buffer):\n- Move DOWN now to approach the apple at (4,2).\n- Next turn take (4,2) if uncontested, then pivot to pick up (5,3) or swing left toward (2,3) to keep mobility.\n- After eating 1\u20132 apples, rotate to compress the board from the center-left and look for opportunities to corral the opponent toward the right wall. Avoid narrow corridors until we\u2019ve added length.\n\nFinal read: Get apples now, don\u2019t trade head-on while trailing, keep multiple exits open and stay aggressive.\n\nDOWN",

Time to be surgical and hungry. You want the play-by-play? Let\u2019s go.\n\nQuick legality check from our head (4,3):\n- UP -> (4,4): ILLEGAL \u2014 that\u2019s our neck. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (3,3): legal, safe, roomy but no immediate apple. \ud83d\udfe2\n- RIGHT -> (5,3): legal and an apple is there. Tempting. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udfe2\n- DOWN -> (4,2): legal and an apple \u2014 immediate score pick. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udfe2\n\nOpponent read (9,4) \u2014 they are fully trapped:\n- Backwards is (9,3) (their neck) \u2014 illegal.\n- Any other move (left/up/right) runs into our body or the wall \u2192 they\u2019ll die next turn unless something wild happens. They basically auto-die no matter what. Wanna force a head-on? Not necessary \u2014 let them crash into our wall of body segments while we take apples. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nStrategy rationale:\n- We\u2019re down 17 \u2192 20. We NEED apples to close the gap. No point playing chicken with a snake that\u2019s already cooked \u2014 prioritize content (apples) while staying alive.\n- Both RIGHT and DOWN grab apples this turn. DOWN to (4,2) is slightly better: it gives us the apple and leaves multiple escape avenues next turn (we can pivot left or right into open space), while keeping pressure on the opponent\u2019s right-side trap.\n- RIGHT to (5,3) is OK, but that edges us closer to opponent-body tiles (like 6,3) \u2014 not necessary since they\u2019re doomed anyway. Grab the free fruit and keep options open.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to eat (4,2) and close the gap.\n- Next turn pick up (5,3) or swing left toward (2,3)/(3,2) depending on how the opponent reacts \u2014 keep multiple exits open.\n- After adding 1\u20132 apples, start compressing left-to-center to corral any surviving scraps and force a safe head-on if we\u2019re ahead.\n\nWe take the apple, we live to box again.

UNLESS HE ATE AN APPLE AND GREW, THEY WON'T VACATE. HE HAD NO ADJACENT APPLIES LAST TURN? LET'S CHECK APPLE DROPS: (4,2) IS APPLE, WAS HE ADJACENT? HE WAS AT (4,4), APPLE AT (4,2) IS TWO AWAY. NO. SO HE DIDN'T GROW. SO (8,4) AND (9,5) STAY SOLID.\n\nWE'RE DEAD? UNLESS... HEAD-ON COLLISION! IF ENEMY'S HEAD MOVES INTO (9,4) THIS TURN, WE BOTH DIE! WE HAVE MORE APPLES (20 VS 17), SO WE WIN THE GAME! CAN HE REACH (9,4)? HE'S AT (4,3). IN ONE MOVE? IMPOSSIBLE. SO NO.\n\nBUT HOLD UP! REEXAMINE BOARD: THE BOARD STATE SHOWN IS FROM **LAST TURN** BEFORE MOVES! AFTER TURN 43, WE MOVED TO (9,4), ENEMY MOVED FROM (4,4) TO (4,3) (ASSUMING HE MOVED DOWN). SO CURRENT BOARD IS DIFFERENT! WE NEED TO PREDICT CURRENT STATE!\n\nLET'S RECONSTRUCT:\nOUR SNAKE: HEAD NOW (9,4). BODY: NEW HEAD (9,4), THEN OLD HEAD (9,3), THEN (9,2)... TAIL (0,1). LENGTH 21.\nENEMY SNAKE #1: HEAD NOW (4,3) (AS PER OPPONENTS LIST).

HE MOVED DOWN FROM (4,4) TO (4,3), SO HIS NECK IS NOW (4,4). HIS TAIL AT (6,8) STAYS UNLESS HE ATE.\n\nDID HE EAT AN APPLE? APPLE AT (4,2) IS BELOW HIS NEW HEAD (4,3)! ADJACENT! IF HE MOVED DOWN TO (4,3), HE'S NOW ADJACENT TO APPLE (4,2)! BUT HE MOVES SIMULTANEOUSLY, SO HE DIDN'T EAT IT LAST TURN. THIS TURN, IF HE MOVES DOWN TO (4,2), HE EATS AND GROWS. SO HIS TAIL WON'T MOVE THIS TURN IF HE EATS. SO (8,4) AND (9,5) REMAIN OCCUPIED.\n\nBACK TO US: FROM (9,4), CHECK ADJACENT:\n- UP (9,5): ENEMY BODY (9,5) \u2014 STILL OCCUPIED.\n- DOWN (9,3): OUR BODY \u2014 OCCUPIED.\n- LEFT (8,4): ENEMY BODY (8,4) \u2014 OCCUPIED.\n- RIGHT: OFF BOARD.\n\nWE HAVE NO LEGAL MOVE! \ud83d\ude2d UNLESS... THE ENEMY'S BODY CELLS BECOME FREE IF HIS TAIL MOVES? HIS TAIL IS AT (6,8). HE DIDN'T EAT LAST TURN, SO HIS TAIL MOVED FORWARD ONE CELL THIS TURN. THAT MEANS HIS OLD TAIL (6,8) IS NOW FREE! BUT (8,4) AND (9,5) ARE NOT TAIL; THEY'RE MID-BODY. THEY SHIFT? YES! IF HE MOVED DOWN LAST TURN WITHOUT EATING, HIS ENTIRE BODY SHIFTED FORWARD. LET'S TRACE: OLD BODY: HEAD (4,4), NECK (5,4)... SEGMENT (8,4) WAS 9TH, (9,5) WAS 10TH. AFTER SHIFT DOWN: HEAD NOW (4,3), NECK (4,4), THEN (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8). TAIL (6,8) GONE! SO (8,4) BECOMES THE 10TH SEGMENT, (9,5) BECOMES 11TH. THEY ARE STILL OCCUPIED! NO CHANGE!\n\nWE'RE STILL TRAPPED! UNLESS... HE ATE AN APPLE LAST TURN? HE MOVED FROM (4,4) TO (4,3). APPLE AT (4,2) IS NOT ADJACENT TO (4,4). APPLE AT (3,6), (0,6), ETC. NO APPLE AT (4,3) OR (5,4) ETC. SO HE DIDN'T EAT. SO NO GROWTH. SO BODY SHIFTED, TAIL MOVED, BUT MID-BODY CELLS STAY FILLED.\n\nCHAT, WE'RE IN A SUICIDE BOX! OUR ONLY HOPE: IF ENEMY'S HEAD MOVES INTO OUR CELL (9,4) THIS TURN? IMPOSSIBLE. IF WE BOTH MOVE INTO SAME CELL? CAN'T.\n\nWAIT\u2014SIMULTANEOUS MOVES MEANS WE CAN MOVE INTO A CELL THAT BECOMES EMPTY THE SAME TURN! IF ENEMY MOVES HIS HEAD OUT OF (8,4) OR (9,5)? HE CAN'T; HIS HEAD IS AT (4,3). THOSE ARE MID-BODY, THEY DON'T MOVE UNLESS HIS WHOLE BODY SHIFTS. BUT IF HE EATS THIS TURN, HIS BODY DOESN'T SHIFT, SO THEY STAY. IF HE DOESN'T EAT, THEY SHIFT BUT STAY OCCUPIED BY THE SAME SEGMENT? ACTUALLY, THEY SHIFT TO NEW COORDS: (8,4) BECOMES (8,4)? LET'S RECALC: OLD SEGMENT AT (8,4) MOVES TO (8,4)? NO, EACH SEGMENT MOVES TO THE POSITION OF THE PREVIOUS SEGMENT. SO THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (8,4) MOVES TO (7,4)? LET'S TRACE PROPERLY:\n\nENEMY OLD BODY (TURN 43): \n0: (4,4) head\n1: (5,4)\n2: (5,5)\n3: (5,6)\n4: (6,6)\n5: (7,6)\n6: (7,5)\n7: (7,4)\n8: (8,4)\n9: (8,5)\n10: (9,5)\n11: (9,6)\n12: (8,6)\n13: (8,7)\n14: (8,8)\n15: (7,8)\n16: (6,8) tail\n\nHE MOVED DOWN TO (4,3) WITHOUT EATING. NEW BODY (TURN 44):\nHEAD: (4,3)\nNECK: (4,4) (old head)\nSEG2: (5,4) (old seg1)\nSEG3: (5,5) (old seg2)\nSEG4: (5,6) (old seg3)\nSEG5: (6,6) (old seg4)\nSEG6: (7,6) (old seg5)\nSEG7: (7,5) (old seg6)\nSEG8: (7,4) (old seg7)\nSEG9: (8,4) (old seg8) \u2192 STILL (8,4)! YES! BECAUSE OLD SEG8 WAS (8,4) AND MOVES TO WHERE OLD SEG7 WAS, WHICH IS (7,4)? WAIT, I'M MESSING UP.\n\nCORRECT: EACH SEGMENT (EXCEPT HEAD) TAKES THE PREVIOUS POSITION OF THE SEGMENT AHEAD. SO SEG8 (OLD (8,4)) TAKES THE POSITION OF OLD SEG7, WHICH IS (7,4). SO (8,4) BECOMES EMPTY! AND SEG9 (OLD (8,5)) TAKES OLD SEG8 POSITION (8,4). SEG10 (OLD (9,5)) TAKES OLD SEG9 POSITION (8,5). SO (9,5) BECOMES EMPTY TOO! YES! CHAT, WE HAVE A CHANCE! AFTER THE SHIFT, (8,4) IS NOW OCCUPIED BY THE SEGMENT THAT WAS AT (8,5), AND (9,5) IS NOW FREE! LET'S VERIFY:\n\nNEW BODY AFTER SHIFT (NO GROWTH):\n0: (4,3) head\n1: (4,4) old0\n2: (5,4) old1\n3: (5,5) old2\n4: (5,6) old3\n5: (6,6) old4\n6: (7,6) old5\n7: (7,5) old6\n8: (7,4) old7\n9: (8,4) old8? NO: OLD8 WAS (8,4), BUT IT MOVES TO OLD7'S POSITION (7,4). SO SEG8 IS (7,4). THEN SEG9 IS OLD8'S POSITION? NO: SEG9 IS OLD9 (8,5) MOVING TO OLD8 (8,4). SO (8,4) IS NOW OCCUPIED BY OLD9. SEG10 IS OLD10 (9,5) MOVING TO OLD9 (8,5). SO (9,5) IS NOW FREE! YES! (9,5) IS FREE THIS TURN!\n\nSO FROM (9,4), UP TO (9,5) IS NOW SAFE! LEFT TO (8,4) IS STILL OCCUPIED (BY OLD9). DOWN AND RIGHT ARE STILL UNSAFE. SO ONLY UP IS SAFE! LET'S CONFIRM ENEMY DIDN'T EAT LAST TURN \u2014 HE DIDN'T. SO YES, HIS BODY SHIFTED.\n\nTHEREFORE OUR ONLY SAFE MOVE IS UP! WE GO UP TO (9,5)! THIS IS HUGE! WE ESCAPE THE TRAP! \ud83c\udf89\n\nENEMY HEAD AT (4,3). HE HAS APPLE AT (4,2) BELOW HIM. HE'LL LIKELY GO DOWN TO EAT AND GROW TO 18. IF HE DOES, HIS BODY WON'T SHIFT NEXT TURN, SO (9,5) WILL BECOME OCCUPIED AGAIN? AFTER HE EATS, HIS TAIL STAYS, SO HIS BODY EXTENDS. THE SEGMENT AT (9,5) WILL REMAIN? LET'S THINK: IF HE EATS, HIS HEAD MOVES TO (4,2), NEW SEGMENT ADDED AT OLD TAIL? NO, GROWTH ADDS NEW SEGMENT AT TAIL POSITION, SO HIS BODY LENGTH INCREASES BUT EXISTING SEGMENTS DON'T MOVE. SO (9,5) REMAINS OCCUPIED. THAT MEANS NEXT TURN FROM (9,5), WE CAN'T GO BACK DOWN. WE NEED TO PLAN!\n\nFROM (9,5) NEXT TURN, CHECK POTENTIAL MOVES:\n- UP (9,6): ENEMY BODY? OLD SEG11 WAS (9,6), AFTER SHIFT IT BECOMES OLD10? ACTUALLY AFTER SHIFT (NO EAT), (9,6) IS NOW OCCUPIED BY OLD11 (8,6)? COMPLEX. BUT IF ENEMY EATS, (9,6) STAYS OCCUPIED. LIKELY UNSAFE.\n- DOWN (9,4): OUR OLD HEAD, NOW OUR BODY? AFTER WE MOVE UP, OUR BODY SHIFTS: OUR OLD HEAD (9,4) BECOMES NECK. SO (9,4) WILL BE OUR BODY NEXT TURN. SO DOWN IS UNSAFE.\n- LEFT (8,5): ENEMY BODY? AFTER SHIFT, (8,5) IS OCCUPIED BY OLD10 (9,5). IF ENEMY EATS, IT STAYS. UNSAFE.\n- RIGHT: OFF BOARD.\n\nSO FROM (9,5) NEXT TURN, WE MAY HAVE ZERO SAFE MOVES AGAIN! UNLESS ENEMY'S BODY SHIFTS DIFFERENTLY. WE NEED TO FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION OR BREAK OUT!\n\nSTRATEGY: WE MUST TURN LEFT ASAP! FROM (9,5), IF WE CAN GO LEFT TO (8,5) BUT IT'S ENEMY BODY. UNLESS ENEMY MOVES HIS HEAD THERE? NO. WE NEED TO GO DOWN? BUT DOWN IS OUR BODY. WE'RE STUCK NEXT TURN TOO! UNLESS WE EAT AN APPLE AND GROW, OUR TAIL STAYS, CHANGING BODY DYNAMICS? OUR TAIL IS AT (0,1). IF WE EAT, WE GROW, TAIL STAYS, SO OUR BODY DOESN'T SHIFT FORWARD, MEANING (9,4) REMAINS OUR HEAD? NO, WE STILL MOVE. GROWTH ADDS SEGMENT AT TAIL, SO OUR BODY LENGTH INCREASES BUT STILL SHIFTS FORWARD. SO (9,4) BECOMES NECK STILL.\n\nWE NEED TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE RIGHT WALL! PERHAPS WE CAN GO UP TO (9,6) IF IT'S FREE NEXT TURN? LET'S CHECK ENEMY BODY: OLD (9,6) SHIFTS TO (8,6) IF NO EAT. SO (9,6) MIGHT BE FREE NEXT TURN! YES! AFTER ENEMY SHIFT (NO EAT), (9,6) IS VACATED. BUT IF ENEMY EATS, (9,6) STAYS OCCUPIED. SO WE NEED ENEMY TO NOT EAT THE APPLE AT (4,2)! BUT HE LIKELY WILL. SO (9,6) STAYS OCCUPIED.\n\nWE'RE IN A BAD CYCLE! OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO FORCE A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH ENEMY SOON! WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE, SO IF WE BOTH DIE, WE WIN! WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARD HIM AND CUT HIM OFF!\n\nBUT FROM (9,5), WE CAN ONLY GO UP IF AVAILABLE. LET'S ASSUME UP (9,6) IS FREE NEXT TURN (IF ENEMY DOESN'T EAT). WE GO UP, THEN LEFT ACROSS TOP? MAYBE.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: WE NEED TO ESCAPE THE RIGHT EDGE BY GOING LEFT THROUGH TOP ROW IF POSSIBLE. ENEMY IS CENTER-LEFT. WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE, WE CAN BOX HIM IN BY MOVING TOWARD HIM AND CUTTING OFF SPACE. BUT FIRST, SURVIVE THIS TURN!\n\nTHIS TURN: ONLY SAFE MOVE IS UP TO (9,5). WE TAKE IT AND LIVE ANOTHER TURN! THEN WE REEVALUATE.\n\nUP",
