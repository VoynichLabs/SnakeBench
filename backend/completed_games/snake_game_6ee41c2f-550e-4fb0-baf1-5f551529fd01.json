I'm right next to the apple at (8, 4).\n\nLet me check my available moves:\n- UP: (8, 6) - This is where my body segment is, so this would kill me\n- DOWN: (8, 4) - This is where the apple is! This is exactly what I planned\n- LEFT: (7, 5) - This is empty space, so it's safe\n- RIGHT: (9, 5) - This would go outside the board boundary, so I'd die\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (5, 3) with body at [(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. They're still several moves away from the apple at (8, 4), so I can safely claim it.\n\nCurrent apples: (5, 1), (7, 1), (8, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5)\n\nMy optimal move is clearly DOWN to (8, 4) to collect the apple. This will:\n1. Give me 1 point\n2. Make my snake grow by 1 segment\n3. Execute the plan I've been following\n\nAfter collecting this apple, my strategy for next turn should be:\n- Head toward the bottom row apples at (7, 1) and (5, 1) since they're relatively close\n- The enemy snake is likely to go for the apples at (3, 5) and (2, 5) since they're closer to those\n- I should move LEFT after collecting this apple to start positioning myself toward the bottom apples\n- Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position to avoid potential collisions\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (8, 4), move LEFT to start heading toward the bottom row apples at (7, 1) and (5, 1). Watch the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to adapt if they change direction toward my target apples.\n\nDOWN"

Therefore, I will consider going DOWN to avoid both the enemy snake head and my last tail.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\n- Moving forward, I will evaluate opportunities to move RIGHT when safe, initially towards (6, 2) and further ahead towards (6, 3) while planning my path to either (3, 5) or (2, 5).\n\n**Decided Move: DOWN**"

This would kill me.\n- LEFT: (7, 1) - This is where the enemy snake's body is! This would also kill me.\n\nThis is a very dangerous situation. Both DOWN and LEFT are blocked by the enemy snake. I can only go UP, but that's my own body segment at (8, 2).\n\nWait, let me double-check the board representation. Looking at row 1 and 0:\nRow 1: \". . . . . T T T 0 .\"\nRow 0: \"A . . . . . .

However, I can't predict their move, so I need to find a safe move now.\n\nActually, looking again at the coordinates - I think I may have made an error. Let me be very careful:\n- My head is at (8, 1) \n- DOWN would take me to (8, 0) where enemy head is - death\n- LEFT would take me to (7, 1) where enemy body is - death  \n- RIGHT would take me to (9, 1) which is off the board - death\n- UP would take me to (8, 2) where my own body is - death\n\nThis appears to be checkmate!

Let me re-examine if there's any mistake in my analysis... No, I think the situation is clear.\n\nI have to choose the best of bad options.

My body is now at [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)].\n\n2. **Board Conditions:**\n   - Remaining apples are at (3, 5), (2, 5), (0, 4), and (0, 0).\n   - Snake #0 is at position (8, 1) with its body extending from (8, 2) up to (7, 4). \n\n3. **Immediate Risks:**\n   - To my RIGHT is the wall, so I can't move RIGHT. \n   - Moving LEFT to (7, 0) would mean heading into my body, which is a potential collision.\n   - ABOVE me at (8, 1) is part of Snake #0's body.\n   - Moving DOWN would be a safe option. It won't lead immediately toward an apple but maintains safety.\n\n4. **Strategic Considerations:**\n   - The apple at (0, 0) is relatively close and potentially reachable if I head towards it.\n   - I must avoid the head of Snake #0 and any potential traps.\n\n5. **Action Plan:**\n   - The safest move at this moment is to go DOWN to (8, -1), considering into an unsecured area.\n   - This direction allows maintaining proximity to (0, 0) while keeping options open by not being directly beside Snake #0.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\n- Continue towards (0, 0) unless it becomes unsafe, reassess after each move considering the position and movement of Snake #0.\n\n**Decided Move: DOWN**"

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state:\n\nMy snake (ID 0) is at position (8, 1) with body at [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)].\n\nCurrent apples: (3, 5), (2, 5), (0, 4), (0, 0), (2, 2)\n\nLet me analyze my available moves:\n- UP: (8, 2) - This is where my body segment is, so this would kill me\n- DOWN: (8, 0) - This is empty space and safe\n- LEFT: (7, 1) - This is empty space and safe\n- RIGHT: (9, 1) - This would be outside the board boundary, so this would kill me\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at position (8, 0) with body at [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]. Wait, let me re-examine this - the enemy snake is at (8, 0) and has a body segment at (7, 1).\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board:\n- Position (8, 0) shows \"1\" which is the enemy snake's head\n- Position (7, 1) shows \"T\" which is part of the enemy snake's body\n\nSo my options are:\n- DOWN: (8, 0) - This is where the enemy snake's head is! This would kill me.\n- LEFT: (7, 1) - This is where the enemy snake's body is! This would also kill me.\n\nThis is a very dangerous situation. Both DOWN and LEFT are blocked by the enemy snake. I can only go UP, but that's my own body segment at (8, 2).\n\nWait, let me double-check the board representation. Looking at row 1 and 0:\nRow 1: \". . . . . T T T 0 .\"\nRow 0: \"A . . . . . . T 1 .\"\n\nSo at (8, 1) there's \"0\" (my head), at (8, 0) there's \"1\" (enemy head), and at (7, 1) there's \"T\" (enemy body).\n\nI'm in a very tight spot! My only safe move appears to be LEFT to (7, 1), but that has an enemy body segment. Actually, let me recount the enemy snake position more carefully.\n\nThe enemy snake head is at (8, 0) and body at [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]. So (7, 1) is indeed occupied by the enemy.\n\nThis looks like I might be trapped! But wait - let me check if the enemy snake might move and free up a space. However, I can't predict their move, so I need to find a safe move now.\n\nActually, looking again at the coordinates - I think I may have made an error. Let me be very careful:\n- My head is at (8, 1) \n- DOWN would take me to (8, 0) where enemy head is - death\n- LEFT would take me to (7, 1) where enemy body is - death  \n- RIGHT would take me to (9, 1) which is off the board - death\n- UP would take me to (8, 2) where my own body is - death\n\nThis appears to be checkmate! But let me double-check the enemy snake body positions one more time from the given information:\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at position (8, 0) with body at [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)].\n\nYes, (7, 1) is occupied by enemy body. I appear to be completely trapped.\n\nHowever, I must make a move. The least bad option might be to go LEFT and hope for some miracle, but that's definitely death.\n\nWait! Let me re-examine if there's any mistake in my analysis... No, I think the situation is clear.\n\nI have to choose the best of bad options. I'll go LEFT.\n\nStrategy for next turn: This appears to be a losing position, but if by some chance I survive, I should focus on grabbing apples while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT"
