Apple at (8, 5) would require moving left and down. This move keeps me in the upper area.\n\n- **DOWN (9, 6)**: Moves toward the middle-right. The closest apple is (8, 5), which is just one left and one down from here. This is a very strong position to pursue the (8, 5) apple.\n\n- **LEFT (8, 7)**: Moves left along the same row as the enemy head (4, 7). Could lead to head-on collision risk if we both keep moving left. Less ideal.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is the best move because:\n1. It's safe and keeps all options open\n2. It positions me directly above the apple at (8, 5) - I can grab it next turn\n3. It moves me away from the enemy snake's current row (reducing collision risk)\n4. It doesn't trap me in a corner\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nContinue positioning to secure the (8, 5) apple next turn, then assess the board state. The enemy is far away on the left side, so I have room to maneuver safely. Focus on collecting apples on the right side of the board first.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps me on the right edge, reducing collision risk with the enemy on the left\n2. From (9, 5), I can move LEFT to capture (8, 5) next turn\n3. It maintains strategic space and doesn't move me toward the enemy\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue securing the (8, 5) apple next turn. The enemy is still on the left side of the board. Focus on collecting apples on the right side first, then reassess. Maintain distance from the enemy and avoid being herded into corners.\n\nDOWN",

This is a significant development.\n\n## Evaluating All Four Moves\n\n**1. UP (6, 7)**\n- Within bounds ✓\n- No self-collision ✓\n- No collision with enemy at (3, 6) or body at (3, 7) ✓\n- Safe move\n\n**2.

RIGHT (7, 6)**\n- Within bounds ✓\n- But this would move me onto my own body at (7, 6) ✗\n- **ELIMINATED** (moving backwards into own body = death)\n\n## Strategic Analysis\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\nThe enemy just collected the apple at (3, 6), denying me that target. My options are:\n- **(3, 8)** - distance 3 up, but enemy body is at (3, 7) blocking direct vertical approach\n- **(6, 2)** - distance 4 down, a viable target\n- **(3, 2)** - distance 4 down and 3 left, competing zone with enemy\n- **(1, 1)** - distance 5 down and 5 left\n- **(0, 9)** - distance 6 up and 6 left, far away\n\nSince the enemy has moved to (3, 6) and their body is at (3, 7), they're likely heading for (3, 8) or down toward (3, 2). \n\n**Collision Risk Analysis:**\n- LEFT toward (3, 6) would put me on a direct collision course with the enemy head if they move toward me. Too risky.\n- UP toward (6, 7) moves me away from the enemy and opens up the possibility to go UP to (6, 8) then potentially left, or shift focus to (6, 2).\n- DOWN toward (6, 5) moves me toward the apple at (6, 2), which is relatively isolated and safe.\n\n**Best move: DOWN**\nThis move positions me toward the (6, 2) apple, which is 4 cells away and less contested. It keeps me away from the enemy snake's current position and keeps options open for pivoting LEFT or RIGHT afterward.\n\n## Long-term Plan\n1. Move DOWN toward (6, 2) - this is my nearest uncontested apple\n2. After collecting (6, 2), reassess enemy position and move toward (1, 1) if safe, or (3, 2)\n3. Avoid direct competition with enemy around (3, 8) and (3, 2) - prioritize isolated apples first\n4. Monitor for head-on collision opportunities if enemy gets cornered\n\nDOWN",

The enemy head at (4, 6) is positioned near apple (3, 8) or could move toward (3, 2).\n\n- **DOWN**: Moves me to (6, 4), getting me 1 step closer to (6, 2). Very promising. This keeps me on track to collect an isolated apple.\n- **LEFT**: Moves me toward enemy territory where (3, 2) is located. The enemy might also contest this area. Less favorable.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves me away from all apples. Poor choice.\n\n**DOWN is clearly the best move** - it progresses me toward the closest, most isolated apple at (6, 2), and I'll collect it in just one more turn if I continue downward.\n\n## Strategy Note for Next Turn\nContinue DOWN to reach and collect the apple at (6, 2) on turn 8.

UP (6, 4)**\n- Would move onto my own body at (6, 4) ✗\n- **ELIMINATED** (self-collision)\n\n**2.

I can collect the apple at (6, 2) this turn, which will:\n- Give me my 2nd apple (tying with the enemy)\n- Increase my score\n- Keep me on a clear vertical path that maintains control\n\nThe enemy snake is in the upper-left portion of the board (head at 4,6), so there's no collision risk. After collecting this apple, I'll have more options for pursuing the remaining apples.\n\n## Future Strategy Note\nAfter this turn, my head will be at (6, 2) with body at [(6, 3), (6, 4)]. The remaining apples are at (3, 8), (1, 1), (3, 2), (0, 9). The apple at (3, 2) is relatively close (distance 3 to the left). I should move LEFT toward (3, 2) next, being cautious of the enemy position. The (1, 1) apple is also reasonably isolated and could be a good secondary target after that.\n\nDOWN",

I should continue moving northward toward the apple cluster at (3, 8) and (5, 8). These two apples are in close proximity to each other and represent the richest target for apple collection.\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 5) with body at (6, 5). Moving UP to (3, 3) keeps me safe and away from the enemy while positioning me perfectly for the northern apples.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: Move UP to (3, 3) - heading toward the northern apple cluster\n2. Next turn: Continue UP toward (3, 8) to collect that apple\n3. After collecting (3, 8), pivot to collect (5, 8)\n4. Monitor enemy position and adjust if needed\n5. After northern cluster, work on remaining apples at (1, 1), (1, 4), (0, 9)\n\nUP",
