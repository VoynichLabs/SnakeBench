But this moves me away from the remaining apples and doesn't seem strategically beneficial.\n\n**LEFT to (2, 5)**: This would put me directly on the apple at (2, 5)! This is perfect - I can continue my successful strategy of collecting the apples along row 5. This apple is immediately adjacent to my current position.\n\n**RIGHT to (4, 5)**: Can't do this - that's where my body segment is. Would cause self-collision.\n\nThe apple at (2, 5) is right next to me, just one square to the left. This continues my excellent apple collection strategy along row 5. After collecting this apple, I'll have gotten two apples in consecutive moves, which is very efficient.\n\nThe enemy snake at (8, 5) with body at (8, 4) is still far enough away (5 squares) that it's not an immediate threat. Moving LEFT keeps me moving away from it while being productive.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples after this move, I'll have:\n- (1, 7) - which I can reach by going LEFT once more to (1, 5) then UP twice\n- (8, 8) - far away and closer to the enemy snake\n- (0, 9) - reachable but requires more moves\n- (6, 0) - quite far south\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (2, 5), I should consider either continuing LEFT toward (1, 5) to position myself better for the apple at (1, 7), or moving UP to start heading toward that apple directly.\n\nLEFT"

From here we can only move UP (to (8,9)), LEFT (to (7,8)), or RIGHT (to (9,8)) because going down would reverse into our neck.\n\nEvaluating our options:\n\u2022 Moving UP to (8,9) puts us into the top row, which is safe and positions us closer to the apple at (0,9). Once there, we could later maneuver left to collect it.  \n\u2022 Moving LEFT to (7,8) is safe but leaves us less advanced vertically. We\u2019d still have to work upward to get to our target.  \n\u2022 Moving RIGHT to (9,8) is also safe, but it puts us next to the edge, which reduces future maneuverability.\n\nGiven that our enemy is far away and we have abundant open space, moving UP not only keeps us safe but also places us in an advantageous position to reach the apple at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, my decided next move is: UP."

My body is at [(1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)], so I've grown by one segment.\n\nLet me analyze my current options from position (1, 7):\n\n**LEFT to (0, 7)**: Safe move, no obstacles. This would position me well to go after the apple at (0, 9) - I'd just need to move UP twice from there.\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 7)**: Safe move, no obstacles, but this moves me away from the nearest apple at (0, 9).\n\n**UP to (1, 8)**: Safe move, no obstacles. This gets me closer to the apple at (0, 9). From (1, 8) I could go LEFT to (0, 8) then UP to (0, 9).\n\n**DOWN to (1, 6)**: Can't do this - that's where my body segment is now. Would cause self-collision.\n\nThe enemy snake at (8, 9) is still far away and not an immediate threat, but I should keep an eye on it.\n\nMy best options are either LEFT or UP, both leading toward the apple at (0, 9). Let me think about the paths:\n- Path 1: LEFT to (0, 7), then UP, UP to reach (0, 9) - total 3 moves\n- Path 2: UP to (1, 8), then LEFT to (0, 8), then UP to (0, 9) - total 3 moves\n\nBoth are equally efficient. I'll go with UP to (1, 8) as it gives me slightly more flexibility and keeps me closer to the center of my movement options.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue toward the apple at (0, 9). From (1, 8), move LEFT to (0, 8), then UP to collect the apple at (0, 9). After that, reassess the remaining apples on the bottom row.\n\nUP"
