It directly approaches the nearest apple at (5, 5), maximizing the potential for growth while maintaining ample space to navigate and avoid the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After moving left towards (7, 5), I'll continue advancing towards the apple at (5, 5). I'll monitor the enemy snake's position to ensure I avoid any potential collisions, especially as I get closer to the apple where movement options might become limited.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"
