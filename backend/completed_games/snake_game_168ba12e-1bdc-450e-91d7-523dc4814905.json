The enemy snake is at (2, 9).\n\nMy possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n- Moving UP to (1, 8) is safe.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 6) is safe.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 7) is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 7) is safe.\n\nAll immediate moves are safe. Now I need to choose the move that best helps me get apples and avoid the enemy.\n\nThe closest apple to my current position (1, 7) is at (1, 9), with a Manhattan distance of 2 (|1-1| + |9-7| = 2).\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 9). The distance from the enemy to the apple at (1, 9) is 1 (|1-2| + |9-9| = 1).\nThe enemy is one step away from the apple at (1, 9), while I am two steps away. It is highly probable that the enemy snake will move LEFT to (1, 9) and eat the apple next turn.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 8) to get closer to (1, 9), the enemy can still move LEFT to (1, 9) and take the apple before I can reach it.\n\nLet's consider the next closest apple. The apple at (0, 5) has a Manhattan distance of 3 from my current position (1, 7) (|0-1| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3).\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 7), the distance to the apple at (0, 5) becomes 2 (|0-0| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2). This is a good move towards this apple.\n- If I move DOWN to (1, 6), the distance to the apple at (0, 5) becomes 3 (|0-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2, but that's distance 2 from (1,6) to (0,5) not quite right.. |0-1| + |5-6| = 1+1 = 2. No, distance from (1,6) to (0,5) is |0-1|+|5-6| = 1+1 = 2... Wait, distance is |dx| + |dy|. From (1,6) to (0,5) is 1 step left and 1 step down, total 2 steps. My bad, distance is 2, not 3. From (1,7) to (0,5) is |0-1|+|5-7| = 1+2 = 3. From (1,6) to (0,5) is |0-1|+|5-6| = 1+1 = 2. Correct. Moving DOWN to (1,6) also gets me distance 2 from (0,5).\n- If I move LEFT to (0, 7), distance to (0,5) is |0-0|+|5-7| = 0+2 = 2. Correct.\n\nBoth moving LEFT to (0, 7) and moving DOWN to (1, 6) result in a distance of 2 from the apple at (0, 5).\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) sets me up for two DOWN moves to reach (0, 5). (0,7) -> (0,6) -> (0,5).\nMoving DOWN to (1, 6) sets me up for one LEFT move and one DOWN move to reach (0, 5). (1,6) -> (0,6) -> (0,5) OR (1,6) -> (0,6) -> (0,5) OR (1,6) -> (1,5) -> (0,5). The path is L, D or D, L.\n\nLet's check other apples from these positions.\nFrom (0, 7): Closest is (0, 5) at distance 2. Next closest is (1, 9) at distance |1-0|+|9-7|=1+2=3 (but likely taken). Next closest is (8,7) at distance |8-0|+|7-7|=8. (8,6) at 9. (8,4) at 11. (0,5) is the best target.\nFrom (1, 6): Closest is (0, 5) at distance 2. Next closest is (1, 9) at distance |1-1|+|9-6|=0+3=3 (but likely taken). Next closest is (8,6) at distance |8-1|+|6-6|=7. (8,7) at 8. (8,4) at 9. (0,5) is the best target.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN seem viable if targeting (0, 5).\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) keeps me on the edge of the board, which can sometimes be safer but also limits escape routes.\nMoving DOWN to (1, 6) keeps me one step away from the left edge.\n\nGiven that the enemy is likely to take the apple at (1, 9), moving towards the next closest apple at (0, 5) is a better strategy. Both LEFT and DOWN moves are equally close to (0, 5) in terms of final Manhattan distance (distance 2).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the paths to (0,5):\nFrom (1,7) -> LEFT to (0,7) -> DOWN to (0,6) -> DOWN to (0,5). Total 3 moves.\nFrom (1,7) -> DOWN to (1,6) -> LEFT to (0,6) -> DOWN to (0,5). Total 3 moves.\nFrom (1,7) -> DOWN to (1,6) -> DOWN to (1,5) -> LEFT to (0,5). Total 3 moves.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are equally optimal for reaching (0,5). The previous rationale mentioned considering UP towards (1,9) if safe. Since the enemy makes (1,9) less viable, I need a new plan. The rationale didn't explicitly state a backup plan if (1,9) wasn't feasible.\n\nLet's reconsider the previous move's rationale: \"Moving LEFT to (1, 7) positions the snake directly below the apple at (1, 9). From (1, 7), the apple is just 2 steps UP. Next turn, I will likely move UP if it is safe to approach the apple at (1, 9).\"\nThis rationale *strongly* suggested moving UP. While I've analyzed that the enemy is closer and likely to get the apple, sticking to the stated plan unless there's a clear reason *not* to (like collision) could be the intended behaviour of this AI. The prompt asks me to decide the next move. The previous turn's reasoning said I would \"likely move UP if it is safe\". Moving UP to (1, 8) *is* safe.\n\nMaybe the enemy AI doesn't always go for the closest apple, or maybe I'm supposed to follow the stated plan regardless of the enemy's perceived move. The prompt asks for my decision based on the rules and board state. The previous turn's plan is part of the context, but I should make the *best* move now.\n\nHowever, simply moving UP towards an apple the enemy is likely to get doesn't seem optimal for scoring points. Moving towards a different apple that is less contested makes more sense for winning the game.\n\nLet's choose the move that is most likely to lead to getting *an* apple soon. Moving towards (0, 5) seems more reliable than contesting (1, 9) with the enemy.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN lead to the same distance (2) from (0,5) in the next step. Let's choose LEFT as it positions me on the edge, away from the enemy's potential path towards the right side of the board.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to move DOWN towards the apple at (0, 5).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nThe closest apples using Manhattan distance from my current head position (6, 5) are (8, 6) and (8, 4), both at a distance of |8-6| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 and |8-6| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3, respectively. The apple at (8, 7) is also close at distance 4.\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves based on proximity to the closest apples (8, 6) and (8, 4):\n- If I move UP to (6, 6): New position (6, 6). Distance to (8, 6) is |8-6| + |6-6| = 2. Distance to (8, 4) is |8-6| + |4-6| = 4. (Gets closer to (8,6))\n- If I move DOWN to (6, 4): New position (6, 4). Distance to (8, 6) is |8-6| + |6-4| = 4. Distance to (8, 4) is |8-6| + |4-4| = 2. (Gets closer to (8,4))\n- If I move RIGHT to (7, 5): New position (7, 5). Distance to (8, 6) is |8-7| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.

Its head is at (7, 7) and body at [(6, 7)]. Possible safe moves for Enemy 1 from (7, 7) are UP to (7, 8), DOWN to (7, 6), and RIGHT to (8, 7) (avoiding its body at (6, 7)). The apple at (8, 7) is the closest apple to the enemy (distance 1). It is highly likely the enemy will move RIGHT to (8, 7) to consume the apple.\n\nLet's evaluate the safety of my safe moves assuming the enemy moves to (8, 7).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6): My head (6, 6). Enemy head (8, 7). Safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 4): My head (6, 4). Enemy head (8, 7). Safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5): My head (7, 5). Enemy head (8, 7). Safe.\n\nIn all safe move scenarios, my head position in the next turn does not collide with the enemy's likely next head position (8, 7) or its resulting body position (7, 7). Moving RIGHT to (7, 5) places me adjacent to where the enemy's body will be (7, 7) but not on the same square, and also adjacent to apple (8,6). Moving DOWN to (6, 4) or UP to (6, 6) keeps me further from the enemy's projected position after it eats the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the most effective move for getting closer to the available apples on the right side of the board, and the immediate risk from the enemy is low if it takes the closest apple.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: My head will be at (7, 5) and body at [(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]. Assuming the enemy took the apple at (8, 7), the remaining closest apples will be (8, 6) and (8, 4). I will re-evaluate safe moves from (7, 5) and continue moving towards the closest accessible apple, prioritizing safety from walls, my body, and the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Moving DOWN to (7, 4) places me further away from the area the enemy snake is likely to occupy ((8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)) compared to moving RIGHT to (8, 5), which places me adjacent to the enemy's likely next head position.\n\nMoving DOWN seems like the slightly safer approach while still positioning me to grab the next closest apple efficiently.\n\nMy strategy is to move towards the closest available apple, prioritizing moves that keep me safe from collisions with walls, my own body, and the enemy snake. Given the enemy's likely move will take one of the closest apples, I will position myself for the next most accessible apple, favouring the path that minimizes potential immediate conflict with the enemy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Moving LEFT aligns better with this, making progress towards the vertical line containing multiple apples.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away on the right side of the board and poses no immediate threat to any of the safe squares.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving LEFT if it remains safe, or navigate towards the closest apples at (2,1), (0,3), and (2,0).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Moving LEFT is the best option for approaching the closest apples and the general cluster of apples on the left side of the board.\n7.  **Consider Other Factors:**\n    *   Enemy Snake: Enemy 1 is far away on the right side. No immediate threat to the safe squares.\n    *   Self-preservation: All identified safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) do not immediately lead to death.\n    *   Trapping: My snake is short. Not likely to get trapped by my own body or the enemy on the left side.\n8.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT is the best strategic move as it brings me closer to the most apples and specifically the closest ones.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue navigating towards the cluster of apples on the left side of the board (primarily columns 0 and 2), prioritizing the closest available apple while maintaining safety.\n\nFinal Decision: LEFT.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

The enemy snake is away from me.\n\nI need to choose a safe and strategic move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) from my current position (0, 3).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves:\n1.  Move UP to (0, 4): This square is empty and within the board boundaries. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This is a safe move.\n2.  Move DOWN to (0, 2): This square is empty and within the board boundaries. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This is a safe move.\n3.  Move LEFT to (-1, 3): This square is outside the board boundary (x < 0). This is a wall and an unsafe move.\n4.  Move RIGHT to (1, 3): This square is occupied by the first segment of my body. Moving here would cause me to collide with myself. This is an unsafe move.\n\nThe only safe moves are UP to (0, 4) and DOWN to (0, 2).\n\nNow, I need to choose the move that brings me closer to the nearest apple. The apples are at (2, 0), (2, 1), (0, 8), (3, 0), and (3, 1). My current head position is (0, 3).\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n-   (2, 0): |2 - 0| + |0 - 3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n-   (2, 1): |2 - 0| + |1 - 3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n-   (0, 8): |0 - 0| + |8 - 3| = 0 + 5 = 5\n-   (3, 0): |3 - 0| + |0 - 3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n-   (3, 1): |3 - 0| + |1 - 3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 1) with a distance of 4.\n\nLet's see how moving UP or DOWN affects the distance to (2, 1):\n-   If I move UP to (0, 4), the distance to (2, 1) becomes |2 - 0| + |1 - 4| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Increases distance)\n-   If I move DOWN to (0, 2), the distance to (2, 1) becomes |2 - 0| + |1 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Decreases distance)\n\nMoving DOWN brings me closer to the closest apple (2, 1). It also brings me closer to the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board ((2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)). Moving UP would take me towards the single apple at (0, 8), increasing distance to the others. Therefore, moving DOWN is the better strategic choice.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN, my head will be at (0, 2). My body will be [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]. The closest apple is now (2, 1). I will evaluate safe moves from (0, 2) and prioritize moving towards (2, 1), likely moving RIGHT or DOWN depending on the updated state, to reach it.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Move UP to (0, 3): This cell is occupied by the first segment of my body. This is an unsafe move.\n2.

Move RIGHT to (1, 2): This cell is within the board boundaries, is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This is a safe move.\n\nThe only safe moves are DOWN to (0, 1) and RIGHT to (1, 2).\n\nNow, let's determine which safe move is best by considering the distance to the nearest apple. The closest apple to my current position (0, 2) is (2, 1), with a Manhattan distance of |2 - 0| + |1 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (2, 1) after each safe move:\n- If I move DOWN to (0, 1): The distance to (2, 1) becomes |2 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 2 + 0 = 2.\n- If I move RIGHT to (1, 2): The distance to (2, 1) becomes |2 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBoth safe moves reduce the distance to the closest apple (2, 1) to 2. Let's check the distances to the other apples from these potential next positions:\n\nFrom (0, 1) (after moving DOWN):\n- (2, 0): |2 - 0| + |0 - 1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (2, 1): |2 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- (0, 8): |0 - 0| + |8 - 1| = 0 + 7 = 7\n- (3, 0): |3 - 0| + |0 - 1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- (3, 1): |3 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nFrom (1, 2) (after moving RIGHT):\n- (2, 0): |2 - 1| + |0 - 2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (2, 1): |2 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- (0, 8): |0 - 1| + |8 - 2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n- (3, 0): |3 - 1| + |0 - 2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- (3, 1): |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nComparing the resulting distances to all apples, both moves lead to the same set of distances (2, 3, 3, 4, 7) from the respective positions. Strategically, both moves appear equally effective in terms of immediately reducing distance to the closest apple and positioning towards the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board.\n\nSince both moves are safe and equally beneficial based on apple distances, I can choose either. Moving DOWN to (0, 1) places me on the row y=1, which contains two apples (at x=2 and x=3). This feels slightly more direct in approaching the main cluster rows (y=0 and y=1).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn, after moving DOWN to (0, 1), will be to evaluate safe moves from (0, 1) and prioritize moving towards the closest apples (2, 1) and (2, 0), likely heading RIGHT towards (1, 1) or (2, 1).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

Let's check adjacent squares:\n\n- LEFT to (1,8): This seems safe (no snake bodies on (1,8), and inside boundaries). This moves us closer to the apple (1,7), potentially serving as a stepping stone down.\n\n- DOWN to (2,7): It's free and closer to the apples on the bottom rows (at y=0 and y=1). This could be a strategic move to start moving down the board.\n\n- UP to (2,9): (2,9) is inside the board, but we have no apples above and could risk being stuck at top with limited space.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,8): Occupied by our own body, so no.\n\nGiven that the last move was LEFT to (2,8), the move LEFT again to (1,8) seems safe and agrees with the last plan. However, there\u2019s no apple at (1,8), but there is an apple at (1,7) one step down from there.\n\nPotential plan:\n\n- Move LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8).\n\n- Then move DOWN from (1,8) to (1,7) to grab apple at (1,7).\n\nThis allows us to start moving downward towards the cluster of apples on the bottom rows.\n\nThe enemy snake is at:\n\n- Head at (2,1), body at positions (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3).\n\nSo on the bottom left corner the enemy snake occupies (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), but none of these are close to our planned path.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe to start moving DOWN soon.\n\nSummary:\n\nCurrent head (2,8). Moving LEFT to (1,8) next turn aligns with that plan and brings us closer to the apple at (1,7).\n\nLet's check whether moving LEFT again is possible:\n\n- (1,8) is free (not occupied).\n\nThus, moving LEFT is the right move.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nFrom (1,8), move DOWN to (1,7) to eat the apple there, then possibly move further down to the apples at (3,1) and (3,0).\n\nAfter that, attempt to loop back or target the apple at (9,8) if possible.\n\nFor now, KEEP MOVING LEFT.\n\nDecided move: LEFT"

Moving RIGHT to (3, 1) lands on an apple. Moving UP to (2, 2) does not land on an apple.\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT moves are highly desirable as they allow me to collect an apple immediately. The apple at (2,0) is distance 1 away (|2-2|+|0-1|=1) and the apple at (3,1) is also distance 1 away (|3-2|+|1-1|=1).\n\nBoth moves (DOWN to (2,0) and RIGHT to (3,1)) lead to eating an apple and positioning me one step away from another apple at (3,0). There doesn't appear to be a significant difference in safety or future opportunity between these two moves based on the current board state and enemy position.\n\nI will choose to move RIGHT.
