The distance metric used here is the manhattan distance, which measures the minimum number of steps required to travel from one point to another when only horizontal and vertical movements are allowed. The rice consumption metric used here is equal to minus 3 units, assuming that each apple can provide three rice points for the snake. So the expected adjust score for a point can be calculated with the following formula:\n\nexpected_adjust_score = number_of_apples_<|fim_suffix|>nthe time. If you are wasting time in games, i would suggest you should find a better thing to do<|fim_middle|>left - rice_consumption * manhattan_distance_apple_to_tail\n\nAction 2700UN0\n\nAccording to the formula above, we can calculate the expected adjust score for each point in the board state for snake zero. However, since we don't know how many apples are left in the game, we have to make an assumption to fill this information in the calculation. Assuming there are 6 apples left, we can get the following table for expected adjust score:\n\n---\n\n|   | 5 |",
