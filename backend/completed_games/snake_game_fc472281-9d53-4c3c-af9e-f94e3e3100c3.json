That means only the current position matters for collision considerations.\n- Nearby apples are at:\n  - (0, 7): Up and to the left\n  - (7, 1): Far to the right and down\n  - (2, 9): Up and slightly to the right\n  - (6, 5): Same y-coordinate, quite to the right\n  - (0, 6): Slightly to the left and one up from current position\n  \n- The closest apple is at (0, 6), directly to the left and one step upward from our position at (1, 5). Moving left would get us there, but that's only safe if the cell (0, 5) is free.\n- Our current position is (1, 5). The cell to the left (0, 5) is currently empty, so a left move is safe.\n- Moving up would go to (1, 6), which looks empty and could be a good route to reach apples at (0, 6) or (2, 9) eventually.\n- Moving right (to (2, 5)) seems less favorable because (2, 5) isn't near any immediate apples and might be less strategic.\n- Moving down (to (1, 4)) seems less ideal as well, as no apples are nearby downward.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- Moving left seems most promising to reach the nearby apple at (0, 6).\n- Moving up could also be an option, but it might lead us away from the closest apple.\n- Moving in any other direction seems less advantageous.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move seems to be LEFT to approach the apple at (0, 6).\n\nNext, I will execute the move:\n\n**LEFT**",

Currently, my snake is at (4, 3).\n\t- Moving **DOWN** leads to (4, 2), which is safe.\n\t- Moving **RIGHT** leads to (5, 3), which is also safe.\n\t- Moving **UP** or **LEFT** would bring me closer to the wall or the opponent snake, which is risky.\n3. **Strategy**:\n\t- Prioritize safety and focus on creating safe paths to apples without getting trapped.\n\t- Avoid moving too close to enemy snakes while securing apples efficiently.\n\n**Next Move**: **DOWN**.
