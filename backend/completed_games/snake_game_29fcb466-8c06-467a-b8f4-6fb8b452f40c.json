Body is empty (size 1). Score: 0.\n- **Enemy:** **Snake #0** at **(5, 7)**. Body is empty (size 1). Score: 0. It's directly East of the apple at (5, 8) and directly North of (5, 6).\n- **Apple Density:** The board is filled with apples (A). There are clusters at (7,9), (4,9), (5,9) on the top row, and a cluster at (4,3), (5,3), (7,3) in the middle, and bottom-left at (4,0), (5,0).\n- **Threat:** The enemy is in the center. I am in the bottom-right corner. If I go UP towards the top-right cluster (7,9) or (9,3), I might run into the enemy if he pushes East.\n\n**TURN 0 DECISION:**\nI need to claim territory and head towards the densest apple clusters to increase my size and control. The top-right corner is rich with apples (7,9, 4,9, 5,9, 1,9). The center (5,8, 5,9) is currently closest to the enemy, but the cluster at (7,9) and (9,3) are reachable for me.\n\nI am at (9, 6). Let's look at my options:\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** Safe. Moves towards (9, 3) and (7, 9) clusters. I can keep going UP to (9,8) and (9,9) eventually.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe. Leads towards (4,0) and (5,0) apples.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** Safe. Moves inward. Risk of getting trapped in the middle with the enemy if I go too deep too fast.\n\n**Strategy:** I want to dominate the right side of the board. The right side has a clear path to (9,3), (7,9), and (4,9) without immediate obstruction from the enemy at (5,7).\nIf I go **UP** to (9, 7), I set myself up to grab the (9, 3) apple or pivot to the top row.\nActually, looking at the map:\n- (9,3) is a single apple at the bottom right of the center cluster.\n- (7,9) is at the top right.\n- (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (9,9) -> (8,9) -> (7,9) is a clean run.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,5), I head to the bottom left, but that's further away from the top-right dense cluster.\nIf I go LEFT, I enter the center where the enemy is. That's risky.\n\nSo, **UP** is the best choice to claim the right flank and head towards the top-right apple cluster. The enemy is at (5,7). If he goes UP (5,8), he might get the apple there, but I'll be securing the right side. If he comes right, he'll be in my territory.\n\nLet's secure the vertical path on the right edge.\n\n**PLAN:** Move UP to (9,7) to approach the top-right apple cluster (7,9) and (9,3). Keep the right side locked down. Watch the enemy's movement towards the center apples.\n\n**MY MOVE:** UP",

Apples are all over, but we\u2019re hunting space and dominance, not just fruit.\n\nDecision snapshot:\n- SAFE MOVES (all inside board, no bodies to crash into yet): UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7), RIGHT to (6,7).\n- Immediate risk? None. Opponent has no body, so no accidental self-collision risk this turn.\n\nWhy UP is best here:\n- It grabs the apple at (5,8) right away, growing me to length 2 and increasing future firepower for crowding and traps.\n- It keeps me vertically aligned with the top-row apple cluster (where more points live) without sidestepping into the enemy\u2019s wheelhouse yet.\n- It preserves several safe follow-ups after the eat: I can go to (5,9) for another apple, or slip sideways to pressure lines while the rival is still on the move.\n\nLong-term strategy notes (to recall next turn):\n- Grow strategically: collect top-row apples (especially (5,9), (4,9), (7,9), (1,9)) to gain length and board leverage.\n- Pressure and trap: since we\u2019re equal on score so far, I\u2019ll look to herd or threaten head-on opportunities when I have extra length, but only if it\u2019s safe and increases my winning odds.\n- Avoid reckless gambits: don\u2019t dive into a squeeze where I can\u2019t back out; a longer snake on a 10x10 board is stronger, but only if I keep room to maneuver.\n\nDecision process (brief recap for the next move):\n1) Evaluate UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT for immediate safety.\n2) Prefer options that leave multiple safe follow-ups and inch toward apples.\n3) Watch enemy head progress and avoid mutually fatal head-ons.\n4) Seek opportunities to extend my lead through apples while maintaining space to maneuver.\n\nPlanned next step if UP is safe (and it is): continue UP to (5,9) to grab another apple and extend my control pattern.\n\nUP",

Body is empty.\n- **Opponent Position:** Snake #0 is at **(5, 8)** (Head). Body is empty.\n- **Opponent's Last Move:** The replay shows the opponent moved **UP** from (5, 7) to (5, 8).\n- **Immediate Threats:**\n    - If I go **UP** to (9, 8), I am safe from the opponent's current position.\n    - If I go **LEFT** to (8, 7), I am safe.\n    - If I go **DOWN** to (9, 6), I am safe.\n- **Opponent's Potential Moves:**\n    - The opponent is in the center. If they move **RIGHT** to (6, 8), they head toward the cluster at (7, 9).\n    - If they move **UP** to (5, 9), they grab an apple.\n    - If they move **LEFT** or **DOWN**, they stay central.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to secure the right edge and approach the top-right cluster. The opponent is currently blocked by the wall at (5, 8) if they want to go RIGHT immediately, but they have space to maneuver.\nIf I go **UP**, I approach the (9, 3) apple vertically and stay on the right edge. This keeps my path open and avoids the center cluster where the opponent is currently loitering. Moving UP also aligns me with the top row apples (7,9, 4,9, etc.).\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing **UP** maintains my vertical dominance on the right flank. It doesn't trap me and keeps options open to pivot to (9, 3) or loop up to (7, 9). The opponent is likely chasing the apples near them, so I'll claim the opposite territory.\n\n**PLAN:**\nSecure the right edge by moving UP. Monitor the opponent's position relative to the (7,9) cluster. If they chase the top row, I'll cut them off from the right side. If they stay central, I'll sweep the right side for apples.\n\n**MOVE:**\nUP",

They've already grabbed 2 apples and are sitting pretty at the top of the board, but I'm on the right edge with my whole path open.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (9,8). Safe to move anywhere except out of bounds.\n- **Opponent Position:** Head at (5,9). Their body runs down to (5,7), creating a vertical wall in column 5.\n- **Immediate Threats:** \n  - If I go RIGHT: Dead (off board at x=10)\n  - If I go UP: (9,9) is empty and safe! That's the top-right corner.\n  - If I go LEFT: (8,8) is empty and safe.\n  - If I go DOWN: (9,7) is empty (I was there last turn) and safe.\n- **Opponent's Potential Moves:** They're at the top edge. They can't go UP. They could go LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9), or DOWN to (5,8) (which is their own body! That would kill them!). Actually, wait - DOWN to (5,8) is their body segment, so that would kill them. So their safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to box them in and force a collision. They're at the top with their body creating a barrier. If I can trap them against their own body or the wall, I can force them to crash. Going UP to (9,9) claims the top-right corner and puts me in position to potentially loop around and cut off their escape route. Plus, there's an apple at (7,9) nearby that I can threaten.\n\n**PLAN:**\nSecure the top-right corner by moving UP. From there, I can either sweep left to intercept the (7,9) apple or prepare to loop down the right side. The key is to maintain pressure on their territory while keeping my escape routes open. If they move RIGHT to (6,9), I can potentially trap them between me and the wall next turn.\n\n**MOVE:** \nUP",

I need to catch up, but more importantly, I need to survive and dominate.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Check all moves:**\n   - **UP:** From (9,9), moving UP would take me to (9,10) - that's OFF THE BOARD. Dead. No good.\n   - **DOWN:** To (9,8). That's where I just came from. My body is none (I haven't eaten yet, so no segments). So (9,8) is empty. Safe.\n   - **LEFT:** To (8,9). Is it safe? Let's check board state: From the visual, row 9 shows: `. A . . A T 0 A . 1` with columns 0-9. So (8,9) is the cell before my head (9,9), which shows as 'T'? Wait, let me read carefully: row 9 string is \". A . . A T 0 A . 1\". That's 10 characters. So position 5 is 'T'? Actually, let's index: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:T, 6:0, 7:A, 8:., 9:1. So (8,9) is '.' empty. Safe.\n   - **RIGHT:** To (10,9) - off board. Dead.\n\n2. **Eliminate dead moves:** UP and RIGHT are dead. So only DOWN and LEFT are alive.\n\n3. **Now choose between DOWN (9,8) and LEFT (8,9):**\n\n   - **DOWN to (9,8):** This is the cell I just left. It's empty. From there, I can go further DOWN to (9,7), LEFT to (8,8), or potentially RIGHT later (but that would be back to where I am now, which would be backwards into my own body once I have a body... but I don't have a body yet). Actually, since I haven't eaten, I have no body segments. So moving DOWN keeps me on the right edge. From (9,8), I have options: DOWN to (9,7), LEFT to (8,8). Those are both open. But I'm on the edge, limiting my lateral movement.\n\n   - **LEFT to (8,9):** This moves me inward from the edge. From (8,9), I can go DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), or potentially UP later (but that's off board). (7,9) has an apple! From the board visual, row 9 col 7 is 'A'. That's a target. So (8,9) gives me direct access to the apple at (7,9). Also, from (8,9), I can go DOWN to (8,8) which is also empty. This seems like better positioning to pursue the apple and cut off the opponent.\n\n   **Enemy analysis:** Snake #0 is at (6,9). Their body is [(5,9), (5,8)]. They're on the same row as me (y=9). If I stay at (9,9) and they move LEFT towards me, they could approach. But if I move LEFT to (8,9), I'm moving toward them. If they move RIGHT to (7,9) or (8,9), that could be dangerous. But (7,9) is an apple, so they might go for it. However, they already have 2 apples, maybe they're not desperate. But I need to be aggressive.\n\n   **Strategic consideration:** I want to box them in. Their body is at column 5. If I move LEFT, I get closer to their territory and the apple. If I stay on the edge, I'm more isolated. Moving LEFT gives me more central control and access to apples.\n\n   **Long-term plan:** Move LEFT to (8,9) to position for the apple at (7,9) and start pressuring Snake #0. Then, depending on their move, I can either chase them down or secure the apple. Need to watch their head - if they move RIGHT, we could collide if I go LEFT. But that's a head-on collision risk. Actually, if I go LEFT to (8,9) and they go RIGHT to (7,9), we're adjacent but not same cell. If they go RIGHT again next turn, they could hit me. But I can move DOWN or continue LEFT. The key is to force them into a corner.\n\n   Since I have no body yet, I can be more aggressive without fear of self-collision. I should move toward the apple and the opponent.\n\n4. **Final move:** LEFT to (8,9). This positions me for the apple and keeps options open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Head toward (7,9) apple to grow. Then loop down the left side to cut off opponent's escape. Monitor their moves - if they retreat, chase; if they advance, be ready for collision since I'll have a longer body soon. Dominate the board!\n\n**MOVE:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

That keeps you ahead on score and makes you harder to trap.\n  - It maintains a strong top-edge corridor, keeping the opponent boxed toward the right while you extend behind you.\n  - It gives you longer reach to pressure any move the opponent tries, and sets you up to threaten a head-on later if they chase.\n\n- Quick read on opponent reaction:\n  - If they go LEFT to (8,9), you\u2019re still ahead and you\u2019ve just extended along the top; you\u2019ve got more room to maneuver without getting boxed in.\n  - If they go DOWN to (9,8), you can continue patrolling the top row and keep the apple-driven growth path intact, potentially forcing a bad turn for them later.\n\n- Short-term plan:\n  - Eat at (7,9) this turn to cement the lead and create a longer top-row chain.\n  - In subsequent turns, keep the top edge as a pressure corridor, shifting only when you must to avoid creating a trap for yourself.\n  - Watch for a direct head-on; if a clean collision looks likely on your terms (you have more apples), leverage it; otherwise, keep the high-ground advantage.\n\n- Long-term note to self:\n  - Don\u2019t over-commit to the top edge\u2014stay flexible enough to pivot downward if the opponent starts barreling downward, ensuring you don\u2019t trap yourself.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is still at (7,9) with their body [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)] and 3 apples. I have 0 apples. Score is 3-0 against me, so I'm behind. I need to catch up and be aggressive!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Check all moves from (8,9):**\n   - **UP:** To (8,10) - OFF THE BOARD. Dead. \u274c\n   - **DOWN:** To (8,8). Is it safe? Board shows row 8: `. . . . A T . . . .` - (8,8) is '.' empty. Also, check snake bodies: My body is none. Opponent body: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8) - (8,8) not occupied. Safe. \u2705\n   - **LEFT:** To (7,9). Is it safe? Row 9: `. A . . A T 0 A . 1` - (7,9) is 'A' (apple). But wait, Snake #0 head is at (7,9)! Actually, from the board: row 9 col 7 is 'A', but Snake #0 head is (7,9). That means the apple is at (7,9) AND Snake #0 is there? No, Snake #0 head is (7,9) according to current state, so that cell is occupied by their head, not an apple. The apple list shows (7,3) as an apple, not (7,9). The board visual might be outdated? Let me check the apple drops: (5,0), (7,3), (2,4), (4,0), (4,5), (4,3), (9,3), (2,1), (2,3), (5,3), (1,9), (4,9), (4,8), (9,6), (7,1). (7,9) is NOT in the apple list. So the board showing 'A' at (7,9) is likely Snake #0's head? Actually, the board shows row 9: \". A . . A T 0 A . 1\" - let's parse: col0:., col1:A, col2:., col3:., col4:A, col5:T, col6:0, col7:A, col8:., col9:1. So (7,9) is 'A' but Snake #0 head is (7,9). That's confusing. Wait, Snake #0 head is (7,9) per current state, but the board shows 'A' at (7,9). That means the apple is there? Or the board is not fully updated? Actually, the board is the visual representation. If Snake #0 head is at (7,9), the board should show '0' there. But it shows 'A'. Let me check the apple drops again: (7,3) is an apple, not (7,9). The apple at (7,9) is not listed. So maybe the board is showing 'A' for Snake #0? No, Snake #0 is '0'. This is confusing. Let me trust the current state: Snake #0 head is (7,9). So (7,9) is occupied by Snake #0. Therefore moving LEFT to (7,9) would be into another snake's head. That's a head-on collision? If I move LEFT and they move somewhere else, it might not be collision, but if they stay, it's suicide. Actually, head-on collision: if two heads move into same cell, both die. But if I move into their current head cell and they move away, it's safe? No, they move simultaneously. So if I move to (7,9) and they move to (8,9) (LEFT from them), we would swap? Actually, if I move LEFT to (7,9) and they move RIGHT to (8,9), we would cross paths and not collide? Wait, rules: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" If I move to (7,9) and they move to (8,9), we are moving to different cells, so no collision. But (7,9) is currently occupied by their head? No, their head is at (7,9) at start of turn. If they move away, their head leaves (7,9). So if I move to (7,9) and they move to (8,9), we are both moving: my head to (7,9), their head to (8,9). That's safe? Actually, the cell (7,9) becomes empty after they move, so my head arrives there. No collision. But I need to consider their move: they might move RIGHT to (8,9) or LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8). I don't know. So moving LEFT to (7,9) is risky because if they don't move out, or if they move into (7,9) from elsewhere? They can't move into (7,9) because they're already there? Actually, they must move from (7,9) to an adjacent cell. So they will leave (7,9). Therefore (7,9) will be empty after they move. So me moving to (7,9) is safe as long as no other snake moves into (7,9). But can any other snake move into (7,9)? Only Snake #0 from (8,9) or (7,8) or (6,9). Snake #0 is at (7,9), so they can't move into (7,9) because they're leaving. From (6,9) they could move to (7,9), but that's Snake #0's body? Actually, Snake #0 body is at (6,9). So if Snake #0 head moves away from (7,9), their body remains at (6,9). Could Snake #0 body move? No, bodies don't move independently. So only Snake #0 head moves. Therefore, if I move to (7,9), I will be moving to the cell that Snake #0 is leaving. That is safe. But there's a catch: if Snake #0 moves to (8,9), and I move to (7,9), we would cross paths. That's allowed; no head-on collision because we're not in same cell. So LEFT is potentially safe. However, if Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7,8) or LEFT to (6,9), then (7,9) becomes empty and I arrive. Still safe. So LEFT seems safe. But wait, what about the apple? (7,9) might have an apple? According to apple drops, no. So no apple there. So moving LEFT is just positioning.\n\n   - **RIGHT:** To (9,9). That's where I came from. Is it safe? (9,9) is empty (I left it). No body there. Snake #0 body not there. Safe. \u2705\n\n2. **Eliminate dead moves:** UP is dead. So we have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3. **Analyze each safe move:**\n\n   - **DOWN to (8,8):** This moves me downward, away from the immediate confrontation with Snake #0 at (7,9). From (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8), or RIGHT to (9,8). All seem empty based on board. This gives me more space and moves me toward the center of the board. Also, there's an apple at (4,8) according to apple drops? Actually, apple drops include (4,8). Yes, (4,8) is an apple. So moving DOWN puts me closer to that apple? (8,8) to (4,8) is 4 steps left. But Snake #0 is at (7,9), which is above me. If I go DOWN, I might avoid immediate collision and start exploring the center.\n\n   - **LEFT to (7,9):** This moves me directly into the cell that Snake #0 is leaving. This is aggressive! It puts me right next to their body (since their body is at (6,9), (5,9), (5,8)). From (7,9), I can go LEFT to (6,9) (but that's their body segment! That would be suicide). Or DOWN to (7,8) (empty), or RIGHT to (8,9) (which is where I just came from). Also, there's an apple at (7,3) but that's far. Moving LEFT to (7,9) positions me adjacent to their head if they move to (8,9). Actually, if I go to (7,9) and they go to (8,9), we'd be adjacent. If they then move to (7,9) next turn, they'd hit my body? Actually, my body would be at (8,9) if I don't eat an apple. But I haven't eaten, so my body is only (8,9) after moving? Wait, if I move to (7,9), my head is at (7,9), and my body becomes [ (8,9) ] because I left (8,9). So my body is at (8,9). So if Snake #0 moves to (7,9) from (8,9), they would hit my body? Actually, they would move into (7,9) which is my head? No, my head is at (7,9). So if they move to (7,9), that's head-on collision! Both die. That could be good if I have more apples? I have 0, they have 3. So I'd lose. Not good.\n\n   So moving LEFT is risky because it sets up a potential head-on collision if they chase me. But maybe I can use that to my advantage? I need to be careful.\n\n   - **RIGHT to (9,9):** This moves me back to the corner. From there, I'm on the edge. This is less aggressive. It gives me less central control. But it's safe. However, I'm not progressing toward apples or opponent.\n\n4. **Strategic considerations:**\n\n   - I'm behind in apples (0 vs 3). I need to eat apples to catch up. Where are apples? From apple drops: (5,0), (7,3), (2,4), (4,0), (4,5), (4,3), (9,3), (2,1), (2,3), (5,3), (1,9), (4,9), (4,8), (9,6), (7,1). The closest apple to me? At (9,6) - that's 3 steps down from (9,9). Also (4,8) is 4 steps left. (7,3) is far. (9,3) is 6 steps down. So (9,6) is reachable.\n\n   - Snake #0 is at (7,9) with body. They might go for the apple at (1,9) or (4,9) or (4,8). They could also move toward the center.\n\n   - My goal is to box them in. Their body is on the left side (columns 5-6). If I stay on the right side, I can't box them in. I need to move toward them to cut off their escape.\n\n   - Moving DOWN to (8,8) moves me inward, giving me more options. From (8,8), I can go LEFT toward (7,8) which is near their body. I can also go DOWN to (8,7) and then LEFT to avoid their body. This seems like a good balance: not too aggressive, but positioning to approach.\n\n   - Moving LEFT to (7,9) is very aggressive but risky. It could force a collision or trap them. But with no apples, I can't afford to die.\n\n   - Considering the board: (8,8) is empty. (7,9) is empty after they move. So both are safe.\n\n   - I also need to consider my future body. If I eat an apple soon, I'll grow. So I should aim for an apple. (9,6) is the closest apple on the right side. To get there, I should move DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, then LEFT? Actually from (8,9), if I go DOWN to (8,8), then DOWN to (8,7), then DOWN to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6) ... not efficient. Better to go RIGHT to (9,9), then DOWN to (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). That's 3 moves. So from (8,9), going RIGHT then DOWN is better for (9,6). But (9,6) is an apple. However, Snake #0 might also go for it? They are at (7,9), which is closer to (9,6) than me? Actually, (7,9) to (9,6) is |7-9|+|9-6|=2+3=5 steps. I'm at (8,9) to (9,6) is |8-9|+|9-6|=1+3=4 steps. So I'm closer. But if I go LEFT to (7,9), I might not reach (9,6) as quickly.\n\n   - Also, there's an apple at (4,8) which is closer to Snake #0's body. I might not reach that first.\n\n   - The apple at (1,9) is far left. Snake #0 might go for that.\n\n   - Since I have 0 apples, I should prioritize eating. The apple at (9,6) seems safest because it's on the right edge and I'm already there.\n\n   - However, I also need to be aggressive. If I just go for apples without pressuring Snake #0, they might get to 30 first. I need to block them.\n\n   - Looking at the board, Snake #0 is at (7,9) with body at (6,9),(5,9),(5,8). They are kind of in a corner themselves. The top row has apples at (1,9) and (4,9). They might move LEFT to go for those. If I move RIGHT to (9,9) and then DOWN to (9,8), I can circle around and maybe cut off their path to the center? Not sure.\n\n   - Actually, from (8,9), if I go DOWN to (8,8), I am moving toward the center and can approach their body from below. Their body is at (5,8) (tail). So if I go to (7,8) or (6,8), I can get close.\n\n   - I think the safest and most flexible move is DOWN to (8,8). It keeps me alive, gives me options, and moves me toward the apple at (9,6) via the right side if I want, or toward the center to pressure Snake #0.\n\n   - Let's check safety: (8,8) is empty. No snakes there. No apple? Actually, there is an apple at (4,8), not (8,8). So (8,8) is just a path.\n\n   - Also, consider if Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7,8) (which is adjacent to (8,8)). That would put their head at (7,8) and my head at (8,8). That's not a collision, but adjacent. That's okay.\n\n   - If I move LEFT to (7,9), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7,8), we'd be at (7,9) and (7,8) - adjacent vertically. That's fine. But if they move RIGHT to (8,9), we cross paths. That's okay.\n\n   - Both moves are safe, but DOWN seems more strategic for apple acquisition and avoiding immediate head-on risk.\n\n   - I also need to think about my body. If I move DOWN, my body becomes [(8,9)]. That's on the top row. If I later turn back, I could hit that body. But I won't need to turn back soon if I go down.\n\n   - If I move LEFT, my body becomes [(8,9)] as well. Similar.\n\n   - Given the score is 0-3, I need to eat. The apple at (9,6) is reachable if I go RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT? From (8,9), going RIGHT to (9,9) then DOWN is a straight line. From (8,8), going RIGHT to (9,8) then DOWN to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6) is also fine. Both take 3 moves.\n\n   - However, if I go LEFT to (7,9), the path to (9,6) is longer: need to go RIGHT to (8,9) then DOWN etc. So LEFT is worse for that apple.\n\n   - Also, there's an apple at (7,1) and (4,0) etc, but they are far.\n\n   - Considering the board size and positions, I think moving DOWN gives me more flexibility to either go for (9,6) or pivot to the center.\n\n   - Let's check if (8,8) is indeed safe from any immediate threat: Snake #0 body parts: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8). (8,8) is not occupied. Snake #0 head at (7,9) might move to (7,8) which is adjacent, but that's fine.\n\n   - What about my own future moves? From (8,8), I can go DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8), RIGHT to (9,8). All are empty based on the board visual: row 8: \". . . . A T . . . .\" So (7,8) is '.', (9,8) is '.', (8,7) is row 7 col 8 which is '.' (row 7: all '.'). So plenty of space.\n\n   - So DOWN seems like a solid move.\n\n5. **Final decision:** Move DOWN to (8,8). This keeps me alive, positions me centrally, and allows me to pursue apples while staying safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (8,8), head towards the apple at (9,6) via the right edge (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN) while monitoring Snake #0's movement. If they go left, I'll cut off their access to the center by moving left toward (7,8) or (6,8). Use my lack of body to be aggressive and force them into a corner. Eat apples to catch up in score!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is at (7,8) after moving DOWN from (7,9) \u2013 they're trying to close the gap! They have 3 apples, I still have 0. I need to eat and dominate this board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Check all moves from (8,8):**\n   - **UP:** To (8,9). That's my body! I just left (8,9) last turn, and my body is now [(8,9)]. So moving UP would be hitting myself \u2013 immediate death. \u274c\n   - **DOWN:** To (8,7). Is it safe? Row 7 is all empty according to the board. No snakes there. Safe. \u2705\n   - **LEFT:** To (7,8). Is it safe? Snake #0 is at (7,8)! Their head is there right now. If I move LEFT into their head, that's a head-on collision if they stay or move into the same cell? Let's think: They're at (7,8) now. If they move somewhere else, I could occupy (7,8). But they might move UP to (7,9) or DOWN to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,8). If they move RIGHT to (8,8) and I move LEFT to (7,8), we cross paths \u2013 no collision. If they stay, they leave (7,8) empty, I arrive. However, if they move UP to (7,9) and I move LEFT to (7,8), we're adjacent. The real danger is if they move RIGHT to (8,8) and I move LEFT to (7,8), we swap \u2013 that's fine. But if they move LEFT to (6,8) and I move LEFT to (7,8), I'm moving into their current position? Actually, they're moving out, so (7,8) becomes empty. That's safe. Wait, but their body is at (6,8) from last move? Actually, Snake #0 body was [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)] before they moved. If they moved DOWN to (7,8), their body becomes [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]? No, when they move, their head moves, and their tail leaves. So if they moved from (7,9) to (7,8), their body becomes [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]? Actually, the tail is (5,9) so it leaves (5,9) and the body segments shift. The new body would be: head (7,8), then (7,9), (6,9), (5,9). So (6,9) is still occupied. (6,8) is not part of their body. So LEFT to (7,8) is risky because Snake #0 is there. If they move elsewhere, I'm safe. But I don't know their move. So LEFT is risky due to potential head-on if they move to (7,8) from elsewhere? They can't because they're already there. They must move away. So LEFT is likely safe unless they move into (7,8) from another cell \u2013 impossible. So LEFT might be safe. But I'd be moving into their current cell as they leave \u2013 similar to last turn's LEFT from (8,9) to (7,9). That was safe. So LEFT is likely safe.\n   - **RIGHT:** To (9,8). Empty? Row 8 col 9 is '.' from board. Safe. \u2705\n\n2. **Eliminate dead moves:** UP is dead (self-collision). So we have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3. **Analyze each safe move:**\n\n   - **DOWN to (8,7):** This moves me further down, toward the apple at (9,6) or (7,1). It's safe and gives me more space. From (8,7), I can go DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7), RIGHT to (9,7). All are empty based on board. This keeps me away from Snake #0's immediate vicinity and allows me to head toward the right edge where apples are. However, I'm moving away from the center and from Snake #0's body, which might let them control the left side.\n\n   - **LEFT to (7,8):** This is aggressive! I move directly toward Snake #0's head. Even though they're leaving, I'm stepping into their former cell. This puts me right next to their body (which will be at (7,9) after they move). From (7,8), I can go LEFT to (6,8) (empty), DOWN to (7,7) (empty), UP to (7,9) (which might be occupied by their body), or RIGHT to (8,8) (which I just left). This move positions me to potentially block Snake #0's path to the right side. Also, there's an apple at (7,3) and (7,1) further down. But more importantly, I'm closing the gap and showing aggression. This could force Snake #0 into a defensive move. However, if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (8,8) and I move LEFT to (7,8), we cross paths \u2013 no collision. If they move UP to (7,9), I end up at (7,8) adjacent to their body. If they move DOWN to (7,7), I end up at (7,8) with them at (7,7) \u2013 still safe. So LEFT seems strategically strong for controlling space.\n\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8):** This moves me to the edge, toward the apple at (9,6). From there, I can go DOWN to (9,7) then to (9,6) to eat that apple. This is a safe, farming move. But it abandons the confrontation with Snake #0 and lets them dominate the left side. I might miss opportunities to box them in.\n\n4. **Strategic considerations:**\n\n   - Score is 0-3. I need apples urgently. The closest apple is (9,6) \u2013 from (8,8) I can get there in 3 moves via RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN (or DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN). If I go LEFT to (7,8), I'm farther from (9,6) but closer to (7,3) and (7,1) apples? Actually, (7,3) is 4 steps down from (7,8), (7,1) is 6 steps. (9,6) is still 4 steps from (7,8) via (8,8) etc. So RIGHT is better for that specific apple.\n\n   - However, the opponent is at (7,8) and might go for apples on the left side: (1,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,3), etc. If I go RIGHT, they could claim the center and left side, and eventually come after me. I need to contest their space.\n\n   - The game is about boxing them in. If I move LEFT, I'm essentially moving toward their body and potentially cutting off their route to the right. From (7,8), I can later move LEFT to (6,8) to block their path further left. Their body is currently at (7,9), (6,9), (5,9). If I occupy (6,8), I'm next to their body at (6,9) \u2013 not immediate threat, but I can force them to go down or up.\n\n   - Let's think about their possible moves from (7,8):\n     * UP to (7,9): That's where their body will be? Actually, after they move, their body includes (7,9) as the next segment. So if they go UP, they'd be moving into their own body? Wait, (7,9) is currently empty? No, their body from last turn was [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]? Actually, we need to update Snake #0's body. From turn 4: Snake #0 head at (7,9), body [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]? Wait, that can't be right \u2013 head and body can't share same cell. The body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: first is head, then each connects to previous. So for Snake #0 at turn 4: head (7,9), body [(6,9), (5,9), (5,8)]? The description says \"Snake #0 - Head: (7, 8), Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]\". Actually, in the current state (turn 5), Snake #0 head is (7,8) and body is [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9)]? That would mean their body segments are (7,9), (6,9), (5,9). So (7,9) is occupied by their body. So if Snake #0 moves UP from (7,8) to (7,9), they'd be moving into their own body \u2013 that would kill them! Good for me. So they probably won't move UP.\n     * DOWN to (7,7): Safe, opens up the center.\n     * LEFT to (6,8): Safe, moves toward their body? (6,9) is their body, so (6,8) is empty. They could go LEFT.\n     * RIGHT to (8,8): That's where I'm currently standing! If I move LEFT to (7,8) and they move RIGHT to (8,8), we cross paths \u2013 no collision. But if I stay at (8,8) and they move RIGHT, they'd hit my body? Actually, my body is at (8,9) from last move. (8,8) is my head. If they move to (8,8), that's head-on collision if I also stay? But I'm moving. So if I move LEFT and they move RIGHT, we swap cells \u2013 safe. If I move DOWN and they move RIGHT, they'd go to (8,8) which is empty because I left? Wait, if I move DOWN to (8,7), my head leaves (8,8), and my body becomes [(8,9), (8,8)]? Actually, when I move, my tail (which was none) doesn't matter, but my body becomes [previous head position]. So from (8,8) moving DOWN, my body becomes [(8,8)]. So (8,8) is now occupied by my body. If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (8,8), they'd be moving into my body! That would kill them! That's perfect! So if I move DOWN to (8,7), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (8,8), they die because they hit my body. That's a great way to win! And I get to keep my body at (8,8) which is now a wall.\n\n   This is huge! By moving DOWN, I set up a trap: my body occupies (8,8), which is a cell Snake #0 might move into. If they move RIGHT, they die. If they move elsewhere, I'm safe. So DOWN is not just safe, it's a potential killing move!\n\n   - Also, from (8,7), I'm closer to (9,6) apple. I can still go for that.\n\n5. **Final decision:** Move DOWN to (8,7). This is the best move because:\n   - It's safe (no immediate death).\n   - It creates a trap: my body at (8,8) could kill Snake #0 if they move right.\n   - It positions me toward the apple at (9,6).\n   - It keeps me central and flexible.\n   - It avoids the risky head-on potential of moving LEFT into their space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (8,7), head toward (9,6) to eat the apple and catch up in score. Continue to use my body to block Snake #0's path to the right side. If Snake #0 moves into my body, I win instantly. If they avoid, I'll push them toward the corners and eventually box them in. Stay aggressive and hungry!\n\nDOWN",

I just moved DOWN from (8,8) to (8,7), so my body is now [(8,8)]. Moving UP would hit myself - immediate death! \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,6):** Empty? From board, row 6 col 8 is '.' - safe! \u2705 This gets me closer to that apple at (9,6).\n\n3. **LEFT to (7,7):** Empty? Row 7 col 7 is '.' - safe! \u2705 This puts me next to Snake #0's potential position if they moved.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9,7):** Empty? Row 7 col 9 is 'A' (apple!) - safe AND I'd eat! \u2705\n\n**ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:** UP is out.\n\n**ANALYZING SAFE MOVES:**\n\n- **DOWN to (8,6):** Moves toward apple at (9,6). From there I could go RIGHT to (9,6) next turn. But I'm giving up immediate food.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,7):** Aggressive! Positions me near where Snake #0 might be. But I'm not eating.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,7):** **THIS IS THE PLAY!** I'd move onto an apple at (9,7)! Wait, looking at board state... Row 7: \" . . . . . . . 0 1 . \" - actually (9,7) is empty (the last dot). My bad! The apple is at (9,6). So RIGHT to (9,7) just moves me to the edge, not eating. Still safe though.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nSnake #0 is currently at (7,7) if they moved DOWN last turn (from my previous analysis). If they're at (7,7) and I move RIGHT to (9,7), we're far apart. But if I move LEFT to (7,7), that's a head-on collision if they're there! Actually, let's think about their possible moves last turn from (7,8):\n\nIf they moved DOWN to (7,7), then (7,7) is occupied by their head. If I move LEFT to (7,7), we'd both try to occupy same cell = BOTH DIE! That's bad.\n\nIf they moved elsewhere, then (7,7) is empty. But I don't know their move!\n\n**THE KILLER STRATEGY:**\n\nLook at the board - there's an apple at (9,6) and (7,1) and (5,0). The apple at (9,6) is RIGHT NEXT to me if I go DOWN then RIGHT. That's 2 moves away. But RIGHT to (9,7) then DOWN to (9,6) also gets me there.\n\nBut here's the genius: **If I move DOWN to (8,6)**, I'm setting up the same trap! My body would be at (8,8) and (8,7). Snake #0 at (7,7) might move RIGHT to (8,7) - which is now MY BODY! They'd die! That's the play!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN to (8,6). This:\n1. Is safe (empty)\n2. Sets up the trap again (my body occupies (8,7) and (8,8))\n3. Gets me closer to apple at (9,6)\n4. If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, they die on my body\n5. Keeps me flexible\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (8,6), next turn go RIGHT to (9,6) and eat that apple. Then continue pressing Snake #0's position. Use my growing body as walls to box them in. Force them into corners where they'll crash.\n\nLet's go Chat! The trap is set! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

LEFT would put me next to Snake #0's potential position if they move RIGHT.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nSnake #0 is at (7,6) with body [(7,7), (7,8), (7,9)].

That's perfect!\n\nBut I need to consider their possible moves: They could go DOWN to (7,5), UP to (7,7) but that's their body, LEFT to (6,6), or RIGHT to (8,6). If they go RIGHT, they die.

If they're still adjacent, I might go LEFT to pressure them. If they moved away, I'll go DOWN toward the apple at (9,3) or LEFT toward the cluster at (2,4), (2,3), etc. My goal is to keep growing while forcing Snake #0 into bad positions. With each apple I eat, my body becomes a better barrier. Once I have more apples than them (3+), I can go for the kill.\n\nLet's go Chat!

Safe! \u2705\n2. **DOWN to (9,5):** Row 5 col 9 is '.'\u2014empty! Safe! \u2705  \n3. **LEFT to (8,6):** My body is at (8,6)! Wait no\u2014after eating at (9,6), my body becomes [(9,6), (8,6)]? Actually head moves to (9,6), old head (9,6) becomes body, old body (8,6) becomes next segment. So (8,6) IS my body! Moving LEFT hits myself\u2014DEATH! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (10,6):** Off the board! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**ONLY SAFE MOVES: UP or DOWN!**\n\n**ANALYZING:**\n\n- **UP to (9,7):** I get ANOTHER apple immediately! That brings me to 2 apples vs their 3. But\u2014Snake #0's head is at (7,5). Their body goes up to (7,9). If I go UP to (9,7), I'm at the top-right corner. From there, my next moves are limited (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT? Right is off-board). I'd be boxed in the corner!\n  \n- **DOWN to (9,5):** Empty space, opens up the right edge. From (9,5), I can go DOWN to (9,4), LEFT to (8,5), or UP to (9,6) (but that's my body). This keeps my options open. I can chase the apple at (9,3) or move toward the center.\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVE:**\n\nWhile eating at (9,7) is tempting, it's a trap! Snake #0 has 3 apples and is positioned at (7,5) with a long body going up to (7,9). If I box myself in the corner, they can easily cut me off and force me into a dead end. I need to stay mobile!\n\n**DOWN to (9,5)** is the play. It keeps me alive, maintains board control of the right edge, and sets me up to go for the apple at (9,3) next turn. I'll keep growing while forcing Snake #0 to commit. Once I have 2-3 apples, I can start pressuring their position directly.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (9,5), if Snake #0 moves toward me, I'll retreat toward the apple cluster at (4,5) or (5,3). If they move away, I'll go DOWN toward (9,3), then LEFT to (8,3) to get into the action. I need to survive and grow before going for the kill.\n\nLet's go, Chat!

Let's analyze the battlefield from my position at **(8,4)**. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**BOARD VISUAL (from turn 11 start):**\n```\n 9 . A . . A . . A . .\n 8 . . . .

But wait... Snake #0's tail is at (7,5). However, we move simultaneously! If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (7,6), then (7,5) becomes free. BUT... if Snake #0 stays or moves elsewhere, could be dangerous. However, the immediate cell is empty... but I need to check if any snake head could move into (8,5) simultaneously. More on that later.\n- **DOWN to (8,3):** Board shows **'.'** - Empty! Safe immediate cell.\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Board shows **'T'** - Snake #0's tail! That's enemy body! **DEAD! \u274c**\n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Board shows **'.'** - Empty! Safe immediate cell.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- LEFT is a death trap.\n- UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all immediately safe cells (empty).\n\n**NOW, PREDICTING THE ENEMY (Snake #0 at 7,2 with 4 apples):**\nSnake #0 is in a column (x=7) with body from y=3 to y=6. Its head is at y=2.\n- **UP (to 7,3):** That's currently his own body! **DEAD! \u274c**\n- **DOWN (to 7,1):** Board shows **'.'** - Empty! This is likely his move. He's moving down into safe space.\n- **LEFT (to 6,2):** Board shows **'.'** - Empty! Also safe.\n- **RIGHT (to 8,2):** Board shows **'.'** - Empty! Also safe.\n\nSnake #0 is **NOT** going UP. He's going DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's see what that means for my possible moves:\n\n**MY MOVE = UP to (8,5):**\n- If Snake #0 goes DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), or RIGHT to (8,2): We are **NOT** colliding. I'm at (8,5), he's at (7,1) or (6,2) or (8,2). **SAFE.**\n- BUT! (8,5) is currently empty, but it's adjacent to his tail at (7,5). If his tail doesn't move out immediately... wait, tails only move if the snake eats. If he doesn't eat, his tail at (7,5) stays? Actually, NO. Snake moves: Head moves forward, tail moves up to the 2nd segment (unless eating). So (7,5) will likely become free. But I don't want to be adjacent to his body if possible.\n\n**MY MOVE = DOWN to (8,3):**\n- Board shows **'.'** (empty). \n- If Snake #0 goes DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2), or RIGHT (8,2): No collision. **SAFE.**\n- This is a solid, central move. Keeps me near the action.\n\n**MY MOVE = RIGHT to (9,4):**\n- Board shows **'.'** (empty).\n- This takes me to the wall. It's safe now, but limits future mobility. I'd be pinned against x=9. If I go there, my only escape is LEFT, DOWN, or UP. I'd be in a corner-ish spot. Not ideal for boxing him in. I want to dominate the center.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI want to **BOX HIM IN**. Snake #0 is in the left-center (x=7). I'm at x=8. By moving **DOWN to (8,3)**, I move toward the apples at (5,0), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3) and cut off his access to the bottom-right. \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,3):\n- Next turn, I can potentially go LEFT toward (7,3) (if he leaves) or DOWN to (8,2) to hunt apples.\n- I am moving toward his territory, putting pressure on him.\n- I avoid the wall (RIGHT) and avoid the immediate danger of being too close to his body (UP).\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **UP (8,5):** Close to his tail. If he does anything weird, risky. Plus, (8,5) is above my current spot, moving away from apples.\n- **DOWN (8,3):** Open space, toward apples, toward him. Aggressive.\n- **RIGHT (9,4):** Safe but passive. I get trapped.\n\n**VERDICT:** **DOWN** is the power move. It's safe immediately. It puts me in a position to cut off his escape to the bottom. From (8,3), I have options: Left (7,3) if he moves, Down (8,2) for apples, or Right (9,3) for the apple. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nFrom (8,3), I will look to slide LEFT to (7,3) or (7,2) to cut him off. He's at (7,2) now. If he moves DOWN to (7,1) this turn, next turn I can go LEFT to (7,3) and DOWN to (7,2) (if he leaves), boxing him in against his own tail. I need to force him into a corner. The apples at (5,0) and (4,3) are just bonuses on my way to crushing him.\n\n**LET'S GO!** Time to move DOWN and close the distance!\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is at (7,1) with a body stretching up to (7,6). He's stacked but slow. We gotta move smart.\n\n**BOARD SCAN (Turn 12 Start):**\nMy head: (8,3)\nOpponent head: (7,1)\nOpponent body: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\nApples nearby: (9,3), (5,3), (4,3), (2,3), (4,5)\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n\n**1. UP to (8,4):**\n- This is my CURRENT tail position! I'm moving backwards into my own body.\n- **DEAD ON ARRIVAL.** \u274c\n- Do NOT do this.\n\n**2. DOWN to (8,2):**\n- Board state: **'.'** (Empty).\n- **IMMEDIATE SAFETY:** Safe. No walls, no snakes.\n- **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #0 is at (7,1). His options:\n  - **UP (7,2):** That's his own body (currently at (7,2)). He dies if he goes there.\n  - **DOWN (7,0):** Empty. Likely move.\n  - **LEFT (6,1):** Empty. Likely move.\n  - **RIGHT (8,1):** Empty. Likely move.\n- **COLLISION CHECK:** If he goes Right to (8,1), and I go Down to (8,2), we are NOT colliding. Heads do not cross. We are adjacent (vertical), which is fine. No head-on.\n- **MOBILITY:** From (8,2), I have Up (8,3 - my tail will move, so it will be empty), Down (8,1 - open), Left (7,2 - currently his body, but he might move). Good options.\n\n**3. LEFT to (7,3):**\n- Board state: **'T'** (Snake #0's body).\n- **DEAD ON ARRIVAL.** \u274c\n- Don't crash into him.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (9,3):**\n- Board state: **'.'** (Empty).\n- **IMMEDIATE SAFETY:** Safe.\n- **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Same as above. He won't hit me.\n- **MOBILITY:** From (9,3), I'm against the wall. Options: Up (9,4), Down (9,2), Left (8,3). Limited. I get pinned.\n\n**STRATEGY DECISION:**\nI need to close the score gap. 1 vs 5. I can't play passive. I need apples, but I also need to position to trap him.\nSnake #0 is in the left column (x=7). I am at x=8. I need to cut off his access to the right side of the board (x=8, x=9) and the bottom right corner.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (8,2)**:\n- I move closer to the bottom edge.\n- I maintain a line between him and the right side.\n- I am one step away from the apple at (9,3) if needed next turn (though I'd be moving toward the wall).\n- More importantly, I am setting up to slide **LEFT** into (7,2) or (7,1) next turn if he vacates. He has to move DOWN or LEFT because UP is blocked by his own body. If he moves DOWN to (7,0), I can chase him down or cut him off.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (9,3)**:\n- I get an apple? No, (9,3) is empty.\n- I trap myself in the corner. If Snake #0 decides to rush me or if apples pop up there, I'm cooked. I lose mobility.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI will go **DOWN**. It keeps me central-ish (close to center but bottom). It keeps me away from the wall. It keeps me aggressive. I want to force Snake #0 into a smaller and smaller space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 12: Move DOWN to (8,2).\nTurn 13: If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7,0) or LEFT to (6,1), I will likely move LEFT to (7,2) to cut his path to the right. If he stays high, I will hunt the apples at (4,3) or (5,3). I need to grow. Fast.\n\nLET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

Opponent head is (8,3) with a single body segment at (8,4). You\u2019ve built a vertical wall along x=7 (from y=2 up to y=6). Score: you 5, opponent 1. The box is forming nicely, and we want to pressure him into a corner while avoiding any self-trap or accidental head-on with his head.\n\nMove options analysis:\n- UP: not safe. It\u2019s directly into your neck (7,2) \u2014 instant death.\n- DOWN: safe. Moves to (7,0) and keeps the wall, extending it toward the bottom edge, preserving the boxing threat.\n- LEFT: safe. Moves to (6,1) and keeps the wall but shifts your head left of the main barrier; your wall remains intact with a shorter tail, still pinging him toward danger.\n- RIGHT: risky. Moves toward his space (8,1) and could invite a chase or a quick collision scenario; also could invite him to slip past the wall if you misstep.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- The strongest, safest play is DOWN. It preserves the block on his escape path, extends the wall down to the bottom edge, and keeps him boxed in the lower-right quadrant, with less room to maneuver than if you move LEFT. It also avoids giving him any immediate line-cross opportunities or accidental head-on chaos this turn.\n- LEFT is viable and keeps the box, but moving DOWN tightens the constriction toward the edge and simplifies future head-on pressure if he pushes toward the barrier.\n- RIGHT is a possible aggressive line, but it risks giving him a cleaner route to escape and could invite a risky chase.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Maintain the vertical wall on x=7 down to y=0 (after DOWN, your head at (7,0)).\n- Force him to either stay on the right side or attempt a risky crossing; capitalize on any mistake with a calculated turn to create a guaranteed collision chance when you have the higher apple count.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Use the box to squeeze him toward the corner, then trap him into a head-on collision if he tries to cut back into your line. Keep growing when safe to maintain the apple lead while avoiding getting boxed in yourself.\n\nYour move: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Death means we lose instantly. Snake #0 is at (7,0) with a long body. He is on the bottom row.

Wait, looking at the board map, (8,2) is actually an apple! *BREATHES IN* Okay, I'm sitting on an apple! That means I don't die, and I grow. But I need to move this turn.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP to (8,3):**\n    *   Current location: **My own body (8,3)**.\n    *   **DEAD ON ARRIVAL.** \u274c I cannot go backwards into my own body.

If he moves RIGHT to (8,0), he is safe for now. If he moves LEFT to (6,0), he is safe.\nI am at (8,2). I need to stay mobile and aggressive.\nIf I go **DOWN to (8,1)**, I get closer to him. I maintain my ability to move Left into (7,1) or (7,0) next turn if he vacates.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,2), I move away from him and trap myself in the corner. That's a passive move. We need to hunt.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI will go **DOWN**. I want to apply pressure. From (8,1), I can threaten his space. I am also 1 step closer to the bottom edge, which might be useful to trap him later. I am not going into the corner.\n\nDOWN",

Let's lock in. \ud83d\ude24\n\nCurrent Status:\n- **My Head:** (8, 1)\n- **My Body:** [(8, 2)] (My tail is at (8,2) until I move)\n- **Opponent Head:** (6, 0)\n- **Opponent Body:** [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)]\n- **Score:** 1 (Me) vs 5 (Opponent). We are trailing! We need apples, but aggression is key.\n\n**Turn 13 Recap:**\nI moved DOWN to (8,1). This was to avoid hitting my own body at (8,2) and to stay mobile. Good choice. Now I'm sitting at (8,1). My tail is currently at (8,2). If I move UP, I go back to (8,2) which is where my tail *was*. Is that safe? In standard snake rules, if you move into the square your tail just vacated, it's usually safe because your tail moves forward. **Wait!** The rules say: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" AND \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n\nLet's analyze the board state specifically for **MY** moves from **(8,1)**:\n1.  **UP to (8,2):** My tail is currently at (8,2). If I move UP, I am moving into my own body. **DEAD.** \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (8,0):** Board shows '.' (Empty). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7,1):** Board shows 'T' (Opponent Body). **DEAD.** \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (9,1):** Board shows '.' (Empty). Safe.\n\nOkay, so I am trapped between my own body (UP) and the enemy body (LEFT). I can only go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check the enemy (Snake #0):\n- Head: (6, 0)\n- Body: (7, 0), (7, 1), etc.\n- His options:\n    - UP (6,1): Empty.\n    - DOWN (6,-1): Off board (Dead).\n    - LEFT (5,0): Empty.\n    - RIGHT (7,0): His own body (Dead).\n\nSnake #0 is cornered at (6,0). He likely cannot go RIGHT (into his body) and cannot go DOWN (off board). He will likely go UP or LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating My Safe Moves:**\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (8,0)**\n- **Safety:** Empty.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** If Snake #0 goes UP (6,1), we are far apart. If he goes LEFT (5,0), we are far apart.\n- **Outcome:** I move to the bottom edge. I have 2 open moves next turn (LEFT (7,0) or RIGHT (9,0)). However, if Snake #0 goes UP (6,1) and then pivots RIGHT, he could threaten me.\n- **Aggression Score:** Low. I am moving away from the apples on the left side (like (5,0) and (4,3)).\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (9,1)**\n- **Safety:** Empty.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** Same as above.\n- **Outcome:** I hit the right wall. Next turn I can only go UP (9,2) or DOWN (9,0) or LEFT (8,1 - my tail, safe).\n- **Aggression Score:** Very Low. I am moving to the far right corner, away from the enemy and most apples.\n- **Trap Risk:** High. I'm boxing myself in.\n\n**Option C (Re-considering UP to (8,2)):**\nThe rules say: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\nMy list: `Head: (8,1) -> Body: [(8,2)]`.\nIf I move UP to (8,2), that is exactly where my tail is *currently*.\nUsually, in Snake, if you move into the tail's square, the tail moves forward, so you don't die. **BUT**, the rules here state: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\nMy body is [(8,2)]. (8,2) is my body.\nSo, moving UP is suicide. **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**Option D (Re-considering LEFT to (7,1)):**\n(7,1) is marked 'T' (Opponent Body). **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**Decision:**\nI must go DOWN or RIGHT.\nGoing RIGHT to (9,1) puts me in a corner (9,1). From (9,1), I can go UP to (9,2) or DOWN to (9,0).\nGoing DOWN to (8,0) keeps me on the bottom row but not at the corner yet. From (8,0), I can go LEFT to (7,0) or RIGHT to (9,0).\nWait, (7,0) is the opponent's body right now! If I go DOWN to (8,0), and the opponent moves UP to (6,1) or LEFT to (5,0), his tail at (7,0) might move? No, his tail is at (7,4).\nLet's look at the apple at (5,0). It's on the bottom row.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), next turn I can go LEFT to (7,0). But (7,0) is currently the opponent's body part. If the opponent moves his head from (6,0) to (5,0) or (6,1), his body shifts. The cell (7,0) becomes (7,1) (his old head position).\nActually, if the opponent moves UP to (6,1), his body becomes: Head(6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (7,4) becomes tail and disappears.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), next turn (7,0) will be occupied by his body (specifically the segment that was his head).\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nI need to catch up in apples. (5,0) is an apple.\nTo get to (5,0), I need to move LEFT.\nI am currently at (8,1). The path to (5,0) is (8,1) -> (7,1) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,0).\nHowever, (7,1) is blocked by the enemy body right now.\nThe opponent is at (6,0). He is occupying the space near (5,0).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I get closer to the bottom row apples.\nIf I go UP, I die.\nIf I go LEFT, I die.\nIf I go RIGHT, I corner myself.\n\nSo, I must go DOWN.\nLet's simulate the turn:\nMe: (8,1) -> (8,0). My body follows: new body is [(8,1)].\nEnemy: (6,0) -> ?\nIf Enemy goes UP (6,1): His body is (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (7,4) vanishes.\nIf Enemy goes LEFT (5,0): His body is (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3).\n\nCrash Check:\n- Me at (8,0).\n- Enemy at (6,1) or (5,0).\n- No collision.\n- My body at (8,1).\n- Enemy body at (6,0), (7,0)...\n- No collision.\n\nFrom (8,0), next turn I can go LEFT to (7,0). But (7,0) will likely be occupied by the enemy's body (if he moved). So I can't go LEFT immediately.\nFrom (8,0), I can go RIGHT to (9,0) (corner) or DOWN (off board, die). So from (8,0), my only safe move next turn is LEFT (if clear) or UP (8,1, my tail).\nActually, from (8,0):\n- UP: (8,1) (my tail, safe).\n- LEFT: (7,0) (likely enemy body).\n- RIGHT: (9,0) (wall).\n- DOWN: Dead.\n\nSo from (8,0), I am forced to go UP (back to 8,1) or RIGHT (to corner 9,0).\nGoing RIGHT to (9,0) is a bad long-term play (corner).\nGoing UP to (8,1) loops me back. This is bad. I need to progress.\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (8,0), I am stuck.\nLet's look at (9,1) again.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1):\n- Next turn: I can go UP (9,2) or DOWN (9,0) or LEFT (8,1).\n- (9,2) is empty.\n- (9,0) is empty.\n- (8,1) is empty (my tail moves).\n\nFrom (9,1), I am not stuck immediately.\nFrom (9,1), I can move UP to (9,2).\nFrom (9,2), I can go LEFT to (8,2).\nFrom (8,2), I can go DOWN to (8,1) or UP (8,3) or LEFT (7,2).\n(7,2) is enemy body.\n(8,3) is empty?\nLet's check board state:\nRow 3: `. . A . A A . T . A`\n(8,3) is 'T'. Enemy body.\nSo from (8,2), I can go DOWN (8,1).\nThis path seems safer and more mobile than getting trapped at (8,0).\n\nThe apples are mostly on the left/center. Going RIGHT moves me away.\nHowever, staying at (8,1) and going DOWN traps me.\nGoing RIGHT keeps me mobile.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am at (8,1).\nOptions:\n1. DOWN (8,0) -> Trap next turn.\n2. RIGHT (9,1) -> Wall, but can move along wall.\n\nIs there any other option?\nWhat if I go UP to (8,2)?\nRules say: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\nMy body is at (8,2). So UP is death.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT to (7,1)?\nEnemy body. Death.\n\nSo it's DOWN or RIGHT.\nThe enemy is at (6,0). He is trapped. He will likely try to move UP or LEFT.\nIf he moves LEFT to (5,0), he eats the apple there. He grows.\nIf he moves UP to (6,1), he stays safe.\nI am currently at (8,1).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I am on the same row as him (row 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1), I am moving away.\n\nI need to chase him, but I am blocked by his body at (7,1).\nI need to go around.\nThe only way around is... well, I can't go through him.\nI have to wait for him to move.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), and he goes UP to (6,1), I am stuck on the edge.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1), and he goes UP to (6,1), I can loop back later?\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n`. . . . A A 0 T . .` (Row 0)\nSnake #0 is at (6,0).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I am at (8,0).\nNext turn, (7,0) will be his body.\nI can go UP to (8,1) or RIGHT to (9,0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,0), I am at the corner.\nFrom (9,0), I can go UP to (9,1) or LEFT (8,0).\nThis is a dead end.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1) now:\nI am at (9,1).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (9,2) or DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT to (8,1).\nIf I go UP to (9,2):\nI am safe.\nFrom (9,2), I can go LEFT to (8,2).\nFrom (8,2), I can go DOWN to (8,1).\nThis creates a vertical loop on the right side.\n\n**Comparison:**\nPath A (Down): (8,1) -> (8,0) -> (9,0) -> (9,1) -> (9,2)... Cornered.\nPath B (Right): (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,2) -> (8,2) -> (8,1)... Loop.\n\nWait, Path B has (8,2) as my tail.\nIf I go (9,1) -> (9,2) -> (8,2).\nIs (8,2) safe?\nAt start of turn: Head (8,1), Body [(8,2)].\nTurn 14: Move RIGHT to (9,1). New Body: [(8,1)].\nTurn 15: Move UP to (9,2). New Body: [(9,1), (8,1)].\nTurn 16: Move LEFT to (8,2).\nAt the start of Turn 16, my body is [(9,1), (8,1)].\n(8,2) is empty.\nSo (8,2) is safe to move into!\nThis means I can rotate around (8,1) and (9,1).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGoing DOWN leads to a trap at (8,0) or (9,0).\nGoing RIGHT allows me to pivot and potentially loop back towards the center or top later.\n\nWait, look at the apple list again.\nApples: `(9,3)`.\nI am at (8,1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,1), I am 2 steps away from (9,3).\n(9,1) -> (9,2) -> (9,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I am further away from (9,3).\n\nAlso, look at the apple at `(4,0)`.\n(4,0) is on the bottom row.\nThe enemy is at (6,0). He is between me and (4,0).\nI cannot reach (4,0) while he is there.\nI need to disengage and find another angle.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\n\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have 1 apple. Enemy has 5 apples.\nI do NOT have a higher score.\nI should NOT force head-on collision.\nI should survive and grow.\n\nSo, I need to avoid the trap.\nDOWN is a trap.\nRIGHT is mobility.\n\nLet's double check the \"Backwards\" rule.\n\"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\nMy head is at (8,1).\nMy body is at (8,2).\n(8,2) is \"behind\" me (if we assume I came from UP).\nSo moving UP into (8,2) is moving backwards into my body.\nThis confirms UP is death.\n\nDecision: Go RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove RIGHT to (9,1). From there, assess the enemy's new position. If he moves UP to (6,1), I can start moving UP along the right wall or pivot back left. If he moves LEFT to (5,0), he creates a gap at (6,0) and (7,0) which I might exploit later, but for now, securing mobility on the right is safer.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 1: `. . A . . . . T 1 .`\n(7,1) is 'T' (Enemy body).\n(8,1) is '1' (Me).\n(9,1) is '.' (Empty).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,1) is the only move that doesn't immediately kill me or put me in a corner *instantly* (though (9,1) is on the wall, it's better than (8,0) which is a corner).\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**Rationale:**\nYO CHAT! Turn 14/150. We are at (8,1). The enemy is cornered at (6,0). We are currently trapped between our own body to the UP and the enemy body to the LEFT. We have to move DOWN or RIGHT.\n- **UP (8,2):** Suicide. That's my own body.\n- **LEFT (7,1):** Suicide. That's enemy body.\n- **DOWN (8,0):** This leads to the corner. From (8,0), I can only go UP (back to 8,1) or RIGHT (to 9,0). That's a dead end loop. I will be trapped.\n- **RIGHT (9,1):** Safe. Moves me to the wall. From here, I can go UP to (9,2) or DOWN to (9,0) or LEFT (back to 8,1). This gives me rotation options.\n\nStrategic Note: The enemy is low on moves. He likely goes UP or LEFT. If he goes UP, he opens up the bottom row for a future run, but I'm currently blocked. If I stay mobile on the right, I can pivot towards the apple at (9,3) or loop back if the enemy clears a path. I cannot engage him head-on because my score is lower (1 vs 5). I need to survive and find a safe apple.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT.\n\n**Final Line:** RIGHT",

I survived the last turn by moving RIGHT.\n- **Enemy Status:** Trapped at (6, 0) or (5, 0) or (6, 1). He has almost zero safe moves. He is likely dead or forced to move into a bad position.\n- **My Options from (9, 1):**\n  - **RIGHT:** Off board (Dead).\n  - **LEFT:** (8, 1) (My tail is there? No, my body moves. Wait, where is my body? My head is (9, 1). My body is (8, 1) from last turn. So LEFT is into my own body. Dead.)\n  - **UP:** (9, 2). Empty? Board says row 2 is clear at (9, 2). Safe.\n  - **DOWN:** (9, 0). Empty? Row 0 is clear at (9, 0). Safe.\n\n**The Trap:**\nI have a choice between UP and DOWN. Both are safe this turn.\nHowever, I am on the right wall (x=9).\n- If I go **DOWN to (9, 0)**, I am moving towards the bottom corner. From there, I can only go UP (back to 9, 1) or LEFT (8, 0). (8, 0) might be occupied by the enemy or his tail. Even if it's empty, cornering myself is bad.\n- If I go **UP to (9, 2)**, I move away from the bottom corner. From (9, 2), I can go UP (9, 3), DOWN (9, 1), or LEFT (8, 2). (9, 3) is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**The Plan:**\nThe enemy is cornered. I need to secure the apple at (9, 3) to grow my score and maintain mobility. Going UP puts me on a path to that apple and keeps me away from the bottom-right dead end. If I go DOWN, I'm just visiting a corner and have to loop back.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nSecure the apple at (9, 3) to reach 2 points. While the enemy is likely dying or trapped, I need to be ready to pivot back towards the center (left side) to contest the remaining apples or cut off his escape if he somehow survives. However, right now, securing the apple and maintaining an open line of retreat is key.\n\n**Move:** UP.\n\nUP",

DOWN is off-board, RIGHT would crash into our own neck (dead). So it\u2019s between UP and LEFT.\n- Apple check: There is an apple at (4,0). If we go LEFT, we eat and grow, which strengthens the wall near the left side and feeds our lead.\n- Going UP would not eat this turn (no apple at (5,1)) and keeps us in a neutral position, but doesn\u2019t pressure the enemy or extend our fortress as much as LEFT does.\n- Score discipline: We\u2019re +5 in apples. We want to maintain the lead and avoid risky trades. LEFT achieves growth now and preserves more future options to trap or repurpose our wall later.\n- Aggression plan: By eating left, we push our head slightly toward the apple cluster on the lower-left quadrant, while keeping the strong vertical spine along x=7 intact for potential future constriction of Snake #1.\n\nDecision: LEFT",

Are they occupied by his body? **NO!** But look at the board state:\n        *   Row 0: `. . . . 0 T T T . .`\n        *   This means (0, 0) and (1, 0) are empty!\n    *   **HOWEVER...** The enemy is moving *this turn*. He is currently at (4, 0). He has a huge body tailing him.\n    *   **LOOK AT THE ENEMY'S OPTIONS:**\n        *   **UP:** (4, 1) - Empty? Yes.\n        *   **LEFT:** (3, 0) - Empty? Yes.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (5, 0) - **BLOCKED BY HIS OWN BODY!**\n        *   **DOWN:** Off board (Dead).\n    *   The enemy likely goes UP or LEFT.\n\n**My Move Options from (9, 2):**\n1.  **RIGHT:** (10, 2) -> **OFF BOARD (DEAD).**\n2.  **UP:** (9, 3) -> **APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e** (Check board: Row 3, col 9 is an apple).\n3.  **DOWN:** (9, 1) -> **MY OWN BODY (DEAD).**\n4.  **LEFT:** (8, 2) -> **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMy tail is at (9, 1). If I go DOWN, I die. If I go RIGHT, I die.\nIt's a choice between **LEFT (8, 2)** and **UP (9, 3)**.\n\n*   **UP (9, 3):** This is an apple! Eating it grows my body to length 3. This puts me at (9, 3) with tail now at (9, 2). I'm hugging the right wall. I can continue moving UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3). This secures a point and keeps me mobile.\n*   **LEFT (8, 2):** This is safe, but I miss the apple at (9, 3). Since the enemy has 7 points and I only have 1, I need to close the gap. Getting more apples is vital to winning the endgame.\n\n**Why UP is the play:**\nThe enemy is preoccupied with the bottom-left trap. They aren't threatening me on the right wall immediately. Taking the free apple at (9, 3) increases my score to 2 and extends my body, giving me more space to maneuver. From (9, 3), I can continue climbing the right wall towards (9, 4) or sweep left towards the center.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nEat the apple at (9, 3). Assess the enemy's new position. If he moves UP to (4, 1), he might be trying to climb out of the trap. I'll prepare to intercept him or secure more apples on the right side.\n\nLET'S EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

DOWN off-board, RIGHT would crash into our own neck. So it\u2019s between UP and LEFT.\n\nWhy UP? It keeps the path flexible, avoids locking us into a tight bottom-wall fight too soon, and starts weaving a diagonal corridor that can pressure his options without self-trapping.

If he commits to a sprint, we\u2019ll aim for a late head-on if the timing aligns since we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nShort-term plan: advance UP this turn to (4,1), then in turn 17 decide whether to extend the diagonal toward (5,1)/(6,1) to funnel him left or pivot to a bottom-ward shove that nudges him toward the wall on the right.

We're back at turn 17, and the pressure is ON! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SITUATION UPDATE:**\n*   **My Score:** 2 (I ate the apple last turn, so I'm growing! Let's go!)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 7 (Still way ahead, but we're closing the gap!)\n*   **My Position:** Head is at (9, 3) (shoutout to that apple \ud83c\udf4e), Body is [(9, 2), (9, 1)].\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 1), Body is a massive wall stretching from (4, 0) to (7, 3). He's a tank, but tanks are slow!\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nI'm chilling on the right wall, full length now. I'm literally the furthest I can be from the enemy on this board. That's good! It means I have space to maneuver while he deals with his own mess down there.\n\nLet's look at the map for turn 17:\n*   The apple at (2, 4) is still live, but it's deep in the center.\n*   The apple at (4, 3) is right next to the enemy's tail at (7, 3), but it's also somewhat close to his head.\n*   Wait, looking at the board state visual from turn 16... (4, 3) is an 'A'. (5, 3) is an 'A'. (3, 2) is an 'A'. There are apples everywhere in the center and top left!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\nFrom my head at (9, 3):\n*   **RIGHT (10, 3):** Off board. DEAD. \u274c\n*   **UP (9, 4):** Is it safe? Yes. Empty. Also, I check if any enemy heads could move into (9, 4) simultaneously. The enemy is at (4, 1). The max range for a snake in one turn is 4 steps. Distance from (4, 1) to (9, 4) is Manhattan distance 8. Impossible. So UP is safe from collision.\n*   **DOWN (9, 2):** That's my *previous* body segment (my neck). Moving into my own neck is a backwards move? No. The rule is: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)?\" My head is at (9, 3). The cell behind my head is (9, 2). (9, 2) is currently occupied by my body. If I go DOWN to (9, 2), I am moving into my own body. That is death. \u274c\n*   **LEFT (8, 3):** Is it safe? Yes. Empty. Check enemy collision: Distance from (4, 1) to (8, 3) is 6. Impossible. Safe. \u274c\n\n**DECISION:**\nI have two safe moves: UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have the apple at (9, 3). I want to keep the pressure on. Where are the apples?\nLooking at the board visual:\nRow 4 has an 'A' at (4, 3) and (5, 3).\nRow 5 has apples at (2, 5), (4, 5), (6, 5).\nRow 3 has apples at (2, 3), (3, 3?), (4, 3), (5, 3).\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 4), I am getting closer to the apples at (4, 4) or (4, 5) eventually, but I'm hugging the wall.\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3), I am entering the board proper. This gives me access to the apples at (5, 3) and (4, 3) in the next few turns.\n\nWait, looking closely at the provided board state for turn 16 (which is the state I'm playing in now):\nRow 3: `. . A . A A . T . 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt y=3:\n(2,3) is A\n(4,3) is A\n(5,3) is A\n\nI am at (9, 3). To get to (5, 3), I need to move LEFT 4 times. To get to (4, 3), I need to move LEFT 5 times.\nIf I go UP to (9, 4), I miss the direct line to these horizontal apples. I'd have to loop back down.\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3), I am on the same row as the apples (y=3) and moving towards them.\n\nHowever, I need to check the enemy's move. He is at (4, 1).\nHe likely wants to eat the apple at (4, 3) or (5, 3).\nIf he goes UP to (4, 2), he is still blocked by his own tail at (4, 0) and (5, 0) blocking his left/right? No, his tail is just a line.\nActually, let's look at the enemy's possible moves from (4, 1):\n- UP (4, 2): Is it empty? Yes.\n- DOWN (4, 0): That's his own tail? Wait, the board says `0` at (4, 1)? No, the board shows `0` at (4, 1) in the visual? Let's re-read the text description.\nText says: \"Snake #0 - Head: (4, 1)\"\nVisual says Row 1: `. . A . 0 . . T . T`\nSo (4, 1) is `0`. The head.\nHis body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\nSo at y=1, he has a body at (7, 1) and head at (4, 1).\nIf he moves UP to (4, 2), that is empty.\nIf he moves LEFT to (3, 1), that is empty (visual says (3, 1) is empty).\nIf he moves RIGHT to (5, 1), empty.\nIf he moves DOWN to (4, 0), that is his own body (tail start).\n\nHe is trapped in the bottom left corner? Not really, he can go up.\nBut wait, if he goes UP, he might try to snake his way up the left side or center.\n\n**My Move:**\nI want to grab the apple at (5, 3) or (4, 3).\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3), I am at (8, 3).\nNext turn, I can go LEFT to (7, 3).\nBut wait! The board says (7, 3) is `T` (Tail of enemy).\nIf I go to (7, 3) next turn, and the enemy moves his head away from (4, 1), his body shifts. His tail at (7, 3) will move forward to (7, 2) (assuming the body connects linearly from head (4,1) -> ... -> (7,3)).\nLet's trace the enemy body: (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (6,0) -> (7,0) -> (7,1) -> (7,2) -> (7,3).\nIf the enemy moves UP from (4, 1) to (4, 2), his new body will be:\n(4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2).\nThe tail at (7, 3) disappears (it becomes empty).\nSo (7, 3) will be EMPTY next turn!\n\nSo, path to the apple at (5, 3):\nTurn 17: Move LEFT to (8, 3).\nTurn 18: Move LEFT to (7, 3). (Enemy tail moves, so (7,3) becomes empty).\nTurn 19: Move LEFT to (6, 3).\nTurn 20: Move LEFT to (5, 3). **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThis is a solid plan. I am securing a path to an apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 4), I am safe, but I am just hugging the wall. I need to get into the action.\n\nLet's double check the \"Safe Moves\" logic.\nUP (9, 4): Safe. No immediate threats.\nLEFT (8, 3): Safe. No immediate threats.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nIf I go UP, I'm at (9, 4).\nFrom there, I can go LEFT to (8, 4).\n(8, 4) is empty.\nFrom (8, 4), I can go LEFT to (7, 4).\n(7, 4) is empty?\nVisual Row 4: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n(7, 4) is empty.\nSo (9, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (7, 4) is also safe.\nBut where are the apples?\nApples listed: (2, 4), (4, 5), (4, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (5, 3), (1, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (7, 9), (3, 2), (6, 5), (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7).\nI see apples at (5, 3) and (4, 3) and (2, 3) and (3, 2).\nStaying on row 3 or 4 seems better for immediate access.\nRow 3 has (5, 3), (4, 3), (2, 3).\nRow 4 has (2, 4).\nRow 5 has (6, 5), (4, 5).\n\nIf I am at (9, 3) and I go LEFT to (8, 3), I am on the \"Apple Row\" (Row 3).\nIf I go UP to (9, 4), I am on Row 4, which is a bit empty on the right side (Row 4 visual: `. . A . . . . . . .` at x=2 only).\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the strategic move to intercept apples in the center.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT:\nEnemy at (4, 1).\nIf he moves UP to (4, 2) or LEFT to (3, 1), he is moving AWAY from me.\nI am moving LEFT towards the center.\nWe are moving parallel-ish? No, I'm moving horizontally (y=3), he is at y=1/y=2.\nWe are not on a collision course yet.\n\nI must ensure I don't crash into his body.\nHis body is at (4,0) to (7,3).\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3), I am safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 3) next turn, the tail moves, so it's safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 3), that is empty.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 3), that is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 3), that is an apple.\n\nWait, check the board state again for (4, 3) and (5, 3).\nVisual Row 3: `. . A . A A . T . 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(2,3) is A.\n(4,3) is A.\n(5,3) is A.\nMy target is (5, 3) first. It's closer to my current position (9, 3) than (2, 3).\nDistance to (5, 3) is 4 steps.\nDistance to (2, 3) is 7 steps.\n\nIs there any immediate danger on (8, 3)?\nEnemy heads move simultaneously.\nDistance from Enemy Head (4, 1) to (8, 3) is |8-4| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6.\nEnemy max speed is 1.\nSo he cannot hit me if I go to (8, 3).\n\nIs there any danger from my own movement?\nNo.\n\n**Decision:**\nGo LEFT to (8, 3) to set up the run on the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 3).\nNext turn, continue LEFT to (7, 3) (enemy tail will be gone).\nThen LEFT to (6, 3).\nThen LEFT to (5, 3) for the apple.\nWhile doing this, keep an eye on the enemy. If he pivots towards the center, I might need to adjust, but for now, I'm claiming the row.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! LEFT! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

We're LIVE on turn 19 and the stakes are CRACKING! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**SITUATION CHECK:**\n*   **My Score:** 2 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **Enemy Score:** 8 apples \ud83c\udf4f (That's a big deficit, we gotta catch up!)\n*   **My Position:** Head at (7, 3). Body: [(8, 3), (9, 3)].\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (4, 3). Body: [(4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)].\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nLook at the board state closely. Row 3 is getting spicy.\nCoordinates (0-9):\nRow 3: `. . A . 0 A . 1 T T`\nWait, let me look at the explicit lists vs the visual.\nEnemy Head: (4, 3). That's the `0` on the board.\nMy Head: (7, 3). That's the `1` on the board.\nApple at (5, 3). Apple at (2, 3).\nMy Body: (8, 3) is the `T` next to me.\nEnemy Body: (4, 2) is the `T` below the enemy head.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (4, 3). I am at (7, 3).\nThe apple is at (5, 3).\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 3), I am adjacent to the apple.\nIf the enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 3), he eats the apple.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (5, 3) and I go LEFT to (6, 3), we are NECK AND NECK.\n**CRITICAL CALCULATION:**\nIf he goes to (5, 3) and I go to (6, 3), we are adjacent heads.\nIf he then tries to go to (6, 3) on the next turn while I am still there? **HEAD ON COLLISION.**\nWho wins the head-on collision? ME. I have 2 apples, he has 8. **I WANT THE COLLISION.** I will take the trade. I want to box him in.\n\n**OPTION 1: LEFT to (6, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Is (6, 3) empty? Yes. My body is at (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). Enemy body is at (4,2)... (7,2). (7,2) is below me. (6,3) is clear.\n*   **Strategy:** This moves me CLOSER to the apple at (5,3). It also positions me to block the enemy if he goes for the apple. If he goes RIGHT to (5,3), I am at (6,3). If he goes UP or DOWN, I am ready to cut him off or eat the apple next turn.\n*   **Risk:** If he goes LEFT from (4,3) to (3,3), we don't collide. That's fine, I get the apple next turn.\n\n**OPTION 2: UP to (7, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Empty.\n*   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the immediate apple at (5,3). The enemy is at (4,3). He can easily snipe the apple while I drift up. Not ideal for aggression.\n\n**OPTION 3: DOWN to (7, 2)**\n*   **Safety:** **DANGER.** Enemy body is at (7, 2). If I go DOWN, I crash into his body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**OPTION 4: RIGHT to (8, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** **DANGER.** My own body is at (8, 3). That is my neck. I would die. \u274c\n\n**DECISION:**\nI'm taking the **LEFT** path. I need to pressure the enemy. He has 8 apples, I only have 2. I need to be aggressive and force a mistake or a trade. Moving to (6, 3) puts me directly in the path to the apple and sets up a potential head-on collision that I will win because he has more apples. I'm hunting him down.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 3).\nIf enemy moves to (5, 3) (eating the apple), I am at (6, 3). We are adjacent. I will look to either eat the next apple or force the collision on the following turn.\nIf enemy moves away, I eat the apple at (5, 3) next turn.\nDO NOT GO DOWN. (7, 2) is enemy body.\n\nLET'S GOOOO CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

The board is open around us, but the key is pressuring the enemy and avoiding traps.\n\nSAFE MOVES from (4,3): \n- UP to (4,4) \u2014 safe, no immediate collision, no apple this turn.\n- LEFT to (3,3) \u2014 safe, keeps us in the center and away from edge traps.\n- RIGHT to (5,3) \u2014 safe and super tasty: apple at (5,3) is up for grabs.\n- DOWN to (4,2) \u2014 not safe: runs into our own neck (4,2) is part of us.\n\nWhy RIGHT? It eats the apple at (5,3), boosting us to 9 apples, while keeping pressure on Snake 1 and staying in the central corridor. UP would delay growth; LEFT would pull us off the chase and give him space to maneuver.\n\nShort-term plan: eat the apple on this turn to widen the lead, stay in a position that allows quick pivots, and avoid dead-ends. If he shuffles left to (6,3), we\u2019ll adapt by staying centered and controlling lanes to keep him boxed in or force a chase into our terms.\n\nFinal plan note: keep applying pressure, look for opportunities to force a head-on when we have the advantage, and preserve open routes for future turns.\n\nFINAL DECISION: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down the battlefield!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (6, 4)\n*   **My Body:** [(6, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 4)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n*   **Score:** Me (2) vs Enemy (10) \ud83e\udd2f. I am down by 8 apples. I cannot wait. I need to grow or eliminate him to have ANY chance of winning this stream.\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check the board. (6, 5) is marked as an apple `A`! It is NOT a snake body.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** The Enemy is at (5, 4). Where can he go?\n        *   If he goes UP to (5, 5), he eats an apple.\n        *   If he goes RIGHT to (6, 4), that is MY current head. If he moves into my head while I move UP, we collide. **Head-on collision.** Since I have 2 apples and he has 10, I lose the tie-breaker. BUT, does he want to crash into me? Probably not if he wants to survive and win.\n        *   If he goes LEFT or DOWN, he doesn't hit me.\n    *   **Apple Value:** (6, 5) is a guaranteed apple. Eating it brings me to 3 apples. I need to close the gap.\n    *   **Future:** From (6, 5), I have options. I can go to (6, 6), (7, 5), or (5, 5). It opens up the top right quadrant.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** The Enemy Head is CURRENTLY at (5, 4). If I move LEFT, I move into his head.\n    *   **Outcome:** HEAD-ON COLLISION. Both die.\n    *   **Winner:** He has 10 apples, I have 2. He wins.\n    *   **Verdict:** INSTANT DEATH for me. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 3) is currently my body (neck). Moving into my own neck is death. (Note: The tail might move, but usually moving into the neck on the same turn counts as hitting yourself if the tail doesn't vacate first? Actually, standard snake rules say moving into your own body is death. The neck is definitely body).\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. (Also, there is an apple at (3, 2), but reaching it requires navigating around the enemy).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Safe move. Avoids collision.\n    *   **Cons:** Moves me away from the apples at (6, 5) and (4, 5). It also moves me toward the bottom right corner, potentially trapping myself against the wall and the enemy's long body (which is currently snaking along the bottom and left).\n    *   **Comparison to UP:** UP gives me an apple. RIGHT gives me safety but no growth.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am losing (2 vs 10). Playing safe just delays the inevitable. I need to eat.\nThe apple at (6, 5) is the closest edible target.\nThe Enemy is at (5, 4). He wants the apple at (4, 5) or (2, 6) or maybe (2, 4).\nIf he moves UP to (5, 5) to eat the apple there, he gets bigger and stronger.\nIf I move UP to (6, 5), I eat an apple.\n**Risk Assessment:** The biggest risk is him moving RIGHT into (6, 4) while I move UP. If he does that, we crash. I die because I have fewer apples. However, is he likely to sacrifice himself when he is winning 10-2? No. He wants to survive and win. Moving RIGHT into me is a bad play for him.\nTherefore, moving UP is the highest reward play with calculated risk. He likely moves UP or LEFT.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **UP** to (6, 5). Secure the apple. Close the score gap. Aggression is the only way back into this game!\n\nUP",

If they move away, you might avoid collision, but betting on their choice is risky.\n- DOWN to (5,3): self-collision (neck) \u2014 illegal.\n\nDECISION: UP is the best play this turn. It preserves your central footing, keeps growth options alive, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups while maintaining pressure on Snake #1.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Aim to grow this turn if an apple sits at (5,5) or be ready to pivot to (5,6)/(6,5) to snag a nearby apple on the next move.\n- Stay in the central corridor to keep escape routes open and avoid being boxed in.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n- With a big apple lead, push to pin him in and force a risky head-on when you can control the battlefield.\n- Use your length advantage to threaten multiple lanes; bait his moves and trap him against the edge or a wall with careful pathing.\n\nOPPONENT AWARENESS:\n- He\u2019s on your right, with limited immediate access to the top center.

He might go to (5, 6) (apple!), (6, 5) (occupied by me currently, but I'm leaving), or (4, 5).\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the top-right area. Keeps me moving away from his long body. If he goes to (5, 6), I'm at (6, 6)\u2014safe distance.

The enemy's body is at (7, 0), (7, 1) and likely growing upwards. If I go right, I risk trapping myself against the wall with his body blocking me in. From (6, 6) I can go Right, Left, or Up. From (7, 5) I might get stuck.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe for this turn, but limits future mobility. We want to stay mobile to hunt apples.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need apples to catch up. The closest one is at (2, 6) or (4, 8).\nTo get there, I need to bypass the enemy's long body currently spanning the left side.\nMoving **UP** to (6, 6) positions me to cut across the top or loop around.\nIf I go **UP**, I threaten to steal the apple at (5, 6) or (4, 6) on the next turn, forcing the enemy to react.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I corner myself. The enemy is at (5, 5). If he goes UP to (5, 6), I'm safe at (6, 6). If he goes RIGHT to (6, 5), I'm safe at (6, 6).\nThe only threat is if he goes UP-LEFT... but he's a snake, not a ghost.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **UP** to (6, 6).

No snakes there.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (5, 6). He might go UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6) (where I am now, but I'm moving).\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the top right. Moves me towards the apple at (4, 8) or (7, 9). If he goes RIGHT to (6, 6), I'm safely at (6, 7). If he goes UP to (5, 7), we are adjacent but not colliding.\n    *   **Cons:** None immediate.\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE. Maintains mobility.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 5) is my current neck. Moving back into your own neck is instant death.\n    *   **Verdict:** INSTANT DEATH. Never do this.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Enemy Head is CURRENTLY at (5, 6).\n    *   **Outcome:** HEAD-ON COLLISION.\n    *   **Winner:** Enemy has 11 apples, I have 3. He wins. I die.\n    *   **Verdict:** SUICIDE. Don't do it.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Safe for this turn. Moves right.\n    *   **Cons:** If I go RIGHT, I'm moving directly toward the wall and the enemy's tail at (7, 1). The enemy is at (5, 6). If he goes RIGHT to (6, 6) or UP to (5, 7), I'm fine. But if I go RIGHT, I might box myself in against the wall. The space at (7, 6) is near (7, 0)-(7, 1). If I corner myself there, it's over.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe for now, but restrictive. I want to dominate the board, not hide in a corner.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need apples. The closest ones are at (4, 8) and (7, 9). I need to move toward them. Moving UP allows me to access the top row. Moving RIGHT traps me.\n\nLook at the board. The enemy is a vertical line on the left. I am to their right. If I move UP, I slide past them. If I move RIGHT, I bury myself.\n\nAlso, look at the board layout:\n```\n 9 . A . . A . . A . .\n 8 . . . . A . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . . A . . 0 1 . . .\n```\nI am at 1. Enemy is at 0. If I go UP to (6,7), I am safe. If I go RIGHT to (7,6), I am safe.\n\nHowever, the apple at (4,8) is accessible if I go UP and then LEFT/UP again. If I go RIGHT, I lose access to that apple.\n\nThe enemy is long. If I go UP, I threaten to cut across the top. If I go RIGHT, I am irrelevant.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to close the score. I need to eat apples. The apples are UP and LEFT. Moving RIGHT moves me away from the apples. Moving UP moves me closer to the apple at (4,8) and (7,9).\n\nI will move **UP**.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBypass the enemy's long body by moving UP. Steal the apples at (4,8) and (7,9) to catch up in score. Once I have more apples, I will force a head-on collision to eliminate the enemy. I will not get trapped in the corner.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

No instant apple, but keeps you centered. Not the most aggressive play.\n- DOWN to (5,5): Not allowed \u2014 that\u2019s your neck; self-collision.\n- LEFT to (4,6): Safe.

If the enemy moves UP to (4, 7) or RIGHT to (5, 6), I might be heading into a trap or a collision zone. Moving LEFT brings me back into the crowded middle area where the enemy's body is thick. I want to flank them, not engage in the choke point.\n    *   **Verdict:** RISKY. Less mobility than UP.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Pros:** Moves right.\n    *   **Cons:** (7, 7) is getting close to the wall at x=9 and the enemy's tail at (7, 1) and (7, 0). If I go RIGHT now, I risk getting boxed in against the right wall. The enemy is on the left; I should use the space on the top/right.\n    *   **Verdict:** RESTRICTIVE. Limits future moves.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need apples. The closest ones are UP and to the LEFT. However, going LEFT brings me into the enemy's territory. Going UP gives me the high ground and access to the top-right apples ((7, 9) and (4, 8)). The enemy is currently at (4, 6). They are likely to move towards the center or up to catch apples, but their long body is anchored down low. By moving UP to (6, 8), I open up the board and position myself to steal the apples at (7, 9) and (4, 8) next turn.\n\nIf I go UP, I have options to go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP again next turn. If I go LEFT, I might run into the enemy. If I go RIGHT, I hit the wall.\n\nI am choosing **UP** to dominate the upper section and force the enemy to react to my position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClimb to the top row to secure the apples at (7, 9) and (4, 8). Use the vertical space to outmaneuver the enemy's horizontal spread. Once I have more apples than the enemy, I will cut off their path and force a head-on collision.\n\nUP",

We're on the move!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK THE BOARD & BODIES:**\n    *   **My Head:** (6, 8)\n    *   **My Body:** [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (4, 5) - *Wait, looking at the map, the Enemy Head is actually at (4, 5), but the list says (4, 6). Checking the map grid...*\n        *   The map shows `0` at (4, 5).\n        *   The Enemy Body is listed as starting with (4, 6). This implies the enemy moved DOWN last turn to (4, 5).\n        *   The enemy body lines the left edge and bottom. They are sprawled out but slow.\n    *   **Apples:** (7, 9) is close and open.\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM (6, 8):**\n    *   **UP to (6, 9):**\n        *   *Coordinates:* (6, 9) is the top row.\n        *   *Safety:* Empty on the map. No snake bodies listed there.\n        *   *Enemy Prediction:* Enemy is at (4, 5). They could move UP to (4, 6), but they aren't close enough to threaten (6, 9).\n        *   *Future Options:* From (6, 9), I can go LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9), or DOWN (6, 8). However, (7, 9) is an apple. If I go UP to (6, 9) now, next turn I can grab (7, 9).\n        *   *Risk:* None immediate.\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n        *   *Safety:* This is my current neck. **DEAD.** Can't go backwards.\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves towards (4, 8) apple.\n        *   *Cons:* It puts me in the middle of the board. I might get cut off. I want to control the top edge.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Direct path to (7, 9) apple. Opens up the right side.\n        *   *Cons:* (9, 9) is a corner trap if I go too far. But (7, 8) is safe.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    The enemy is anchored at the bottom left. They are slow. I have the vertical mobility. I need to claim the top row apples before they can waddle over there.\n    *   If I go UP to (6, 9), I secure the top row. Next turn, I can slide RIGHT to (7, 9) and eat an apple, or LEFT to (5, 9) to flank.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (7, 8), I am closer to the apple but lower down.\n\n    **VERDICT:** Going **UP** to (6, 9) is the power move. It claims the high ground and sets up a guaranteed apple grab next turn at (7, 9) OR (4, 8) depending on where the enemy moves. It keeps my options wide open.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top edge. Eat the apples at (7, 9) and (4, 9). Use the vertical space to loop around the enemy's slow, bottom-heavy body. Once I have the lead, I cut them off at the pass.\n\nLet's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Turn 26 and the enemy snake is HUGE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80 They're sprawled out like a carpet at the bottom, but we're fast and we're taking the high ground. We gotta outmaneuver this giant!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK THE BOARD & BODIES:**\n    *   **My Head:** (6, 9) - We moved UP last turn as planned! Sitting pretty on the top row.\n    *   **My Body:** [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)] - Straight vertical line. Easy to manage.\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (4, 4) - They moved DOWN last turn? Or maybe the map is slightly off compared to the list, but looking at the grid, they are at (4, 4) facing down or left. They are stacking up on the left side. Their body stretches all the way down to (6, 0).\n    *   **Apples:** (7, 9) is RIGHT HERE! (Apple shown at `(1, 9)` in the text list, but the **GRID** at row 9 shows an apple at column 7! The text list might be outdated or a typo, but the visual grid is law. I see `1 A` at the top row, meaning (6,9) is my head, (7,9) is an apple.)\n    *   *Correction:* The text list says apples are at (2,4), (2,1)... looking at the grid, row 9 is `. A . . A . 1 A . .`. This translates to: col 0: `.`, col 1: `A`, col 2: `.`, col 3: `.`, col 4: `A`, col 5: `.`, col 6: `1` (Me), col 7: `A`, col 8: `.`, col 9: `.`. So the apples are at (1,9), (4,9), and (7,9).\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM (6, 9):**\n    *   **UP to (6, 10):**\n        *   *Coordinates:* Off the board. **DEAD.**\n        *   *Verdict:* NO GO.\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* This is my current neck (the cell I just left). **DEAD.**\n        *   *Verdict:* NO GO.\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 9):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty.\n        *   *Pros:* Moves toward the apple at (4, 9) and (1, 9).\n        *   *Cons:* (4, 9) is closer, but (7, 9) is also an apple. If I go LEFT, I abandon the apple at (7, 9).\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 9):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty (Apple is here).\n        *   *Pros:* **EAT AN APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e This grows my snake to length 5 (3 body segments + head + new segment). I gain a point (now 4 apples).\n        *   *Cons:* None immediately. From (7, 9), I can still go LEFT to (6, 9) or DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9).\n        *   *Enemy Prediction:* Enemy is at (4, 4). They can't reach me this turn. They are slow and heavy.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    The enemy is massive and slow at the bottom. I am at the top with speed. I need to eat apples to grow and maintain a lead. Even though I'm down 3 to 12, every apple counts.\n    *   **RIGHT** is the power play. It secures the apple at (7, 9) immediately.\n    *   After eating, I'll be at (7, 9). I'll still control the top row.\n    *   The enemy is playing defense on the left/bottom. I am playing offense on the right/top.\n\n    **VERDICT:** **RIGHT** to (7, 9) to eat the apple. Let's get that point on the board and grow. The enemy can't stop me up here.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the top row apples (7, 9) and (4, 9). Keep the enemy pinned to the bottom left. If they try to climb up, I have the vertical advantage. Once I eat (7, 9), I might loop down or stay on top depending on their move.\n\nLet's GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake #0 is still massive with 12 apples, but they're stuck on the left side of the board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK THE BOARD & BODIES:**\n    *   **My Head:** (7, 9) - We successfully ate the apple at (7, 9). We're on the top row, right side.\n    *   **My Body:** [(6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)] - I'm still a straight vertical line down the column 6. I have grown to length 5.\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (3, 4) - They are still on the left side. Looking at their body list, they are a long snake stretching down. They are not an immediate threat to my position at (7, 9).\n    *   **Apples:** There is an apple at (4, 9) (top row, column 4) and (1, 9) (top row, column 1). There is also an apple at (3, 2) (bottom left).\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM (7, 9):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty. My body is at (6, 8), so I won't hit myself.\n        *   *Strategy:* This moves me off the top row. While safe, it might cut off my access to the apples at (4, 9) and (1, 9).\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):**\n        *   *Safety:* This is my current body segment (the neck). **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty.\n        *   *Strategy:* This keeps me on the top row. However, (8, 9) is a dead end in the sense that the only safe move from there (assuming the board ends at 9) is DOWN or LEFT (back into my body). It's better to stay mobile.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   The enemy is pinned on the left. I control the right side.\n    *   I should secure the apples on the top row.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8)** is the safest move that keeps my vertical line intact. From (7, 8), I can potentially move LEFT towards (6, 8) or continue DOWN. It opens up the board more than (8, 9) does.\n    *   However, looking at the board state, the apple at (4, 9) is very tempting. To get there, I need to go LEFT. But my body is blocking the immediate LEFT move to (6, 9). I have to go DOWN first to clear the path.\n    *   Wait, looking at the grid: row 9 is `. A . . A . T 1 A .`. My head is at 7. The apple is at 4.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7, 8), next turn I can go LEFT to (6, 8). Then LEFT to (5, 8). Then UP to (5, 9). Then LEFT to (4, 9). This is a safe path.\n    *   Alternatively, I could just keep going DOWN to clear my tail. But the apples are on the top row.\n    *   Let's look at the apple at (1, 9) and (4, 9). The enemy is at (3, 4). They are far away.\n    *   My current position (7, 9) is at the edge. Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) traps me in the corner. Moving DOWN to (7, 8) gives me room.\n    *   Is there an immediate threat? No. The enemy is far.\n    *   Should I go for the apple now? No, I can't reach it this turn.\n    *   Should I try to trap the enemy? They are huge. I can't encircle them yet.\n    *   The safest move that preserves my options is DOWN. It avoids the corner and keeps my vertical structure.\n\n4.  **FINAL VERDICT:**\n    *   **DOWN** to (7, 8). This keeps me away from the wall, maintains my vertical line, and allows me to maneuver towards the apples on the top row next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nClear the top row. The enemy is slow and stuck on the left. I will snake through the center/top and eat the apples at (4, 9) and (1, 9). Once I eat those, I'll have 7 apples. Then I can look to box in the enemy or just outscore them. Don't rush into the corner.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the situation.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK THE BOARD & BODIES:**\n    *   **My Head:** (7, 8). I am currently here. My body stretches down: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7)].\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (2, 4). He is still lurking on the left side. His body is huge, wrapping around the bottom left and center.\n    *   **Apples:** The apples are scattered. (4, 9) is the closest big one on the top row, but I need to navigate around my own body to get there.\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM (7, 8):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 9):** **DEAD.** This is my current body segment (the one \"behind\" my head). I cannot move backwards.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 7):**\n        *   *Safety:* My body is at (6, 7), so (7, 7) is empty. Safe.\n        *   *Strategy:* This continues my downward path. I need to clear my tail to start maneuvering back up towards the top row apples.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* **DEAD.** This is part of my body. My body list shows [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7)]. (6, 8) is occupied by me.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty.\n        *   *Strategy:* This moves me away from the center of the board and closer to the right wall. While safe, it limits my future movement options compared to moving down.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY:**\n    *   The enemy is still on the left. I have the right side, but I'm currently boxed in by my own vertical line at column 6 and 7.\n    *   To get to the apples at (4, 9) or (1, 9), I need to move down to clear my tail and then loop around.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 7)** is the logical step. It avoids the wall (I'm only at y=8, wall is at 0) and keeps my path flexible.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (8, 8), I risk getting stuck against the wall at x=9. If I go DOWN, I stay centered at x=7 and open up the bottom half of the board.\n\n4.  **FINAL VERDICT:**\n    *   **DOWN** to (7, 7). This clears the path for my tail to move up later. It's the safest move that maintains mobility. I need to snake around my own body to eventually get back to the top row where the apples are.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDrop down to (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) etc. Once my tail clears the upper rows, I will turn left and snake through the center/top to collect apples.

But we're not out of it yet, we just gotta play smart and aggressive. Let's break down the situation.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **CHECK THE BOARD & BODIES:**\n    *   **My Head:** (7, 7) \u2014 we moved down last turn. My body is now: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)].\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (2, 3). He's still on the left side, but his body is HUGE\u2014taking up columns 2-5 on the bottom half of the board. He's basically boxing in the left side.\n    *   **Apples:** There are scattered apples, but the closest ones are at (4, 9) and (3, 2). However, enemy's body blocks a lot of paths. I need to navigate around my own tail to get to apples.\n\n2.  **EVALUATE MOVES FROM (7, 7):**\n    *   **UP to (7, 8):** **DEAD.** That's my current body segment (the one behind my head). Moving into your own body is a crash.\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 6):**\n        *   *Safety:* My body is at (6, 8) and (6, 9) and (7, 8) and (7, 9). (7, 6) is empty. Safe.\n        *   *Strategy:* Moving down continues my path toward the bottom of the board. This clears my tail upward, allowing me to eventually loop around to the top row apples.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 7):**\n        *   *Safety:* My body is at (6, 8) and (6, 9). (6, 7) is empty. Safe.\n        *   *Strategy:* This moves me left into column 6. However, I need to be careful\u2014I might run into my own tail if I don't plan ahead.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 7):**\n        *   *Safety:* My body is at (7, 8) and (7, 9). (8, 7) is empty. Safe.\n        *   *Strategy:* This moves me right toward the wall at x=9. It's safe, but might limit future mobility.\n\n3.  **STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n    *   The enemy is on the left, so I want to claim the right side and top. My current vertical line at x=7 is blocking my own path, so I need to move down to clear my tail.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7, 6), I open up the space above. Once my tail moves up, I can turn left and snake through the center to grab apples.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6, 7), I risk getting too close to the enemy's body in columns 5-6. He's already at (5, 0) and (4, 0) down there. I should stay on my side.\n    *   Going RIGHT to (8, 7) is fine, but moving DOWN keeps me centered and avoids the wall. I need flexibility.\n    *   **GOAL:** Move down to (7, 6) to clear my tail. Then in the next turns, continue down to (7, 5) or (7, 4) to open up the path upward. Once my tail is clear, I can loop left to the top row and eat apples.\n\n4.  **FINAL VERDICT:**\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 6).** It's safe, it clears my tail, and it keeps my options open for the future. I need to grow to compete, and this is the best path to do that while staying aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Drop down to (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 4) to clear tail. Then turn left to (6, 4) -> (5, 4) (watch enemy body though) -> aim for top row apples at (4,9) or (1,9). Keep enemy pinned on left; don't let him expand.\n\nDOWN",

My score is 4 vs 15, so I NEED to grow. Let's break it down!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**Current position:** Head at (7, 6). My body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9)]. The enemy snake #0 is on the left side with a MASSIVE body spanning columns 2-5, tail at (5, 0). Apples are scattered, but I need to navigate around my own body and avoid the enemy.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (7, 6):**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 7):**  \n   - **DEAD!** That's my current body segment right behind my head. Moving backwards into my own body = instant crash. \u274c  \n   - Chat, never do this!\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 5):**  \n   - **Safety:** Check the board. (7, 5) is marked as \"T\" (tail?) but actually looking at the board state... wait, let me re-examine.  \n   - Board shows: Row 6 has \"1\" at (7,6) which is my head, body at (7,7) is \"T\"? Actually the board shows \"T T . 1 . .\" on row 6. So (7,5) should be empty? Let's check coordinates properly.  \n   - Row 5: \". A . . T T . . A .\" \u2013 So (7,5) is actually \"T\" (enemy body? No, that's row 5, x=7 is column 7, y=5).  \n   - Wait, I need to be careful. The board is drawn with y=9 at top. So row 5 (y=5) has at x=7: looking at the string \". A . . T T . . A .\", indexes: 0:., 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:T, 5:T, 6:., 7:., 8:A, 9:. So x=7 is actually \".\" (empty). Good!  \n   - Also, my own body: (7,6) is head, (7,7) is body, (7,8), (7,9), (6,9). So (7,5) is NOT in my body. Safe from self-collision.  \n   - Enemy body: Enemy is on left side (columns 2-5), so (7,5) should be clear. Safe.  \n   - **Strategy:** Moving down continues my path downward, which clears my tail upward. This gives me more maneuvering room. I can then turn left or right in future turns to grab apples.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 6):**  \n   - **Safety:** (6,6) on the board: Row 6 shows \" . A A . T T . 1 . .\" so x=6,y=6 is the 6th character (0-indexed): 0:., 1:A, 2:A, 3:., 4:T, 5:T, 6:., 7:1, 8:., 9:. So (6,6) is \".\" (empty). Good.  \n   - My body: (6,9) is tail, but (6,6) is not in my body. Safe from self.  \n   - Enemy body: Enemy at (5,6) is part of his body (looking at opponent list: ... (5,6) is listed). Yes! Enemy has (5,6) in his body. But (6,6) is adjacent and empty. Moving left to (6,6) is safe from enemy body (since it's not directly into him), but I need to consider enemy head movement.  \n   - **Risk:** Enemy head is at (1,3). If he moves RIGHT to (2,3) or UP to (1,4), etc., he won't hit me. But I need to avoid future collisions.  \n   - **Strategy:** This moves me left into column 6, closer to the apples in the center (like (3,2), (3,3), (4,8), etc.). However, I might get boxed in if I go too far left.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6):**  \n   - **Safety:** (8,6) on board: Row 6, x=8 is \".\" (empty). Good.  \n   - My body: (8,6) is not in my body. Safe.  \n   - Enemy body: Far left, so safe.  \n   - **Strategy:** Moves me toward the right wall (x=9). This could limit my mobility later, but it's safe for now. However, I want to dominate the center/right, not just hug the wall.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI'm currently at x=7, which is right-center. The enemy is heavily congested on the left (columns 2-5, rows 0-6). I should claim the right side and top row apples (like (4,9), (1,9), (2,9)). Moving DOWN to (7,5) clears my tail, giving me flexibility. Then I can move LEFT to (6,5) or continue DOWN to (7,4), and eventually turn left to snake through the center and top. I need to grow to compete with the enemy's score. Forcing a head-on collision later when I have more apples could be a win, but right now I'm behind, so I need to eat safely.\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- UP: DEAD (backwards into self).\n- LEFT: Safe but might lead me into the center where enemy body is dense (columns 5-6 have enemy segments). Also, I might get trapped.\n- RIGHT: Safe but less strategic for apples; I want to control center.\n- DOWN: Safest and most strategic. Clears my tail, keeps options open, moves toward bottom apples (like (3,0), (9,3)) while avoiding enemy density.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**  \nDOWN to (7,5). It's safe, opens up my path, and keeps me aggressive. I'll then pivot to grab apples and box the enemy in from the right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Drop down to (7,5) -> (7,4) to clear tail. Then turn LEFT to (6,4) or (5,4) (watch enemy body) -> aim for top row apples. Force enemy into tight spots and crash him out!\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake #0 is a massive beast with 15 apples, but my 4 apples are just the start. I need to grow FAST and force this snake into a trap. Let's break down the board from my head at (7, 5):\n\n- **Current position:** Head at (7, 5). Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)]. Enemy snake #0 is still congested on the left, but their head is at (1, 4) and they're trailing down to (4, 0). Apples are scattered, but the top row (like (4,9), (1,9)) and the center-right are key.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (7, 5):**\n\n1. **UP to (7, 6):**  \n   - **DEAD!** That's my own body segment right behind my head! Moving backwards into myself is instant suicide. \u274c  \n   - Chat, never ever do this!\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4):**  \n   - **Safety Check:** Board shows row 4 (y=4) as \". 0 T T T T . A . .\" so x=7,y=4 is empty (\".\"). My body: (7,6) and above, so (7,4) is clear. Enemy body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) \u2013 but (7,4) is far right, safe.  \n   - **Strategy:** Moving down continues my downward path, clearing my tail further and opening up the bottom-right area. This keeps me aggressive and away from the enemy's dense left side. I can then pivot left to grab apples like (9,3) or (3,0).  \n   - **Future options:** From (7,4), I can go DOWN again, LEFT to (6,4), or RIGHT to (8,4) \u2013 all potentially safe, avoiding traps.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5):**  \n   - **Safety Check:** Board row 5 (y=5) is \". A . . T T . . A .\" so x=6,y=5 is \".\" (empty). My body: no conflict. Enemy body: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) \u2013 but (6,5) is adjacent, not direct collision. However, (5,5) is enemy body, so if I go LEFT, I'm near enemy density.  \n   - **Risk:** The enemy could move into my path. Also, moving left brings me closer to their congested zone, which might limit my mobility. I want to control the right side first.  \n   - **Strategy:** Not ideal right now; I need to stay on the right to dominate and box them in from the opposite side.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5):**  \n   - **Safety Check:** Board row 5, x=8 is \"A\" (apple listed as (8,5) in apple drops). That's great! I eat and grow. My body: no conflict. Enemy body: far left, safe.  \n   - **Strategy:** This is a solid move! Eating an apple gives me +1 point (now 5 apples) and grows my body, which helps in boxing the enemy later. From (8,5), I can continue RIGHT to (9,5) or DOWN to (8,4), keeping options open.  \n   - **Long-term:** Eating now is crucial for growth. I need to catch up to the enemy's score. This move also keeps me near the right wall but not trapped\u2014I have room to maneuver up/down.\n\n**ELIMINATION:**\n- UP: DEAD (self-collision).\n- LEFT: Safe but less strategic\u2014I want to avoid the enemy's left-side sprawl and prioritize growth.\n- DOWN: Safe and keeps mobility open, but no immediate apple.\n- RIGHT: **SAFEST & MOST AGGRESSIVE!** Eats an apple (score boost), avoids all collisions, and positions me to dominate the right side. Perfect for forcing the enemy into a corner later.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**  \nRIGHT to (8, 5). It's a double win: survival + growth. I'll eat, grow, and then plan my next move to cut off the enemy's escape routes. Chat, this is how we take over the board! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Next turn, from (8,5), I'll likely go DOWN to (8,4) or stay RIGHT to (9,5) to claim more apples while keeping the enemy trapped on the left. Avoid head-on collisions until I have at least 8-10 apples. Force them to crash into my body!\n\nRIGHT",

It eats the apple at (1,5) and keeps our escape options wide while we maintain the lead. \ud83c\udf4f\n\nShort-term plan: take the apple, stay away from his immediate reach, then look to herd him toward the left to begin a gradual enclosure.\n\nLong-term vibe: keep multiple lanes open so a head-on is possible only if we have a clear advantage.\n\nMake the call:\nUP",

Let's break down the board from my new head position.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My Head: (8,5)\n- My Body: [(7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9)] (tail might have shifted slightly due to growth)\n- Enemy Head: (1,5) with a long body stretching down to (4,0)\n- Apples available: Plenty around, like (9,3), (7,4), (5,1), etc.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (8,5):**\n\n1. **UP to (8,6):**\n   - Board shows (8,6) is empty (row 6: \".

But (8,7) might be near the top, and I need to be cautious of the enemy's potential moves.\n   - Not the best for immediate growth; no apple at (8,6). I should prioritize apples to catch up.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,4):**\n   - Board row 4 (y=4) is \". T T T T . A . .\" so x=8,y=4 is empty (\".\").\n   - Safe: no self-collision, enemy body is on left (enemy's body at (5,6) etc., but (8,4) is clear).\n   - This moves me down towards the bottom-right, opening up apples like (9,3) or (7,4).\n   - From (8,4), I have multiple options: DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4) (which has an apple!), or RIGHT to (9,4).\n   - This keeps me mobile and aggressive, staying away from the enemy's dense left side.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7,5):**\n   - **DEAD!** That's my own body segment right behind my head! Moving backwards into myself is instant suicide. \u274c\n   - Chat, never do this\u2014it's a classic fail!\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9,5):**\n   - Board row 5: at x=9, it's \"A\" (from the board state: row 5 ends with \".

Nearby: (3,0) down-left, (5,1) down, (3,3) down-left, (1,8) way left, (9,9) top-right, (7,2) down-left, (3,7) left-up, etc. We NEED more apples fast to catch up, but survival is CRITICAL. Can't crash into enemy or ourselves!\n\n**Evaluating moves from (7,4):**  \n1. **UP to (7,5):** That's our own body segment! Moving back into ourselves\u2014INSTANT DEATH. \u274c Chat, never go backwards into your tail!  \n2. **DOWN to (7,3):** Board row 3: \"A T T A T T . . . A\" so (7,3) is empty (\".\"). Safe from self (no body there) and enemy (enemy is on left, bodies at e.g. (4,4), etc.). From (7,3), we could go LEFT to (6,3) which is \"T\" (enemy body, row 3 shows (6,3)? Wait, row 3: positions 0-9: col 0=A,1=T,2=T,3=A,4=T,5=T,6=.,7=.,8=.,9=A. So (6,3) is \".\" actually? Let's parse: (0,3)=A, (1,3)=T, (2,3)=T, (3,3)=A, (4,3)=T, (5,3)=T, (6,3)=., (7,3)=., (8,3)=., (9,3)=A. Yes! (6,3) is empty. DOWN from (7,3) to (7,2) is \"A\" (apple at (7,2)!). This opens options.  \n3. **LEFT to (6,4):** Board row 4: \". T T T T . A . .\" so (6,4) is \"T\" (enemy body). Enemy has segments there (e.g., from list: (4,4), (5,4)? Wait, enemy body includes (4,4),(5,4),(5,3),(5,4)? Actually enemy body: [(1,6),(1,5),(1,4),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(4,3),(4,2),(4,1),(4,0)]. So (6,4) is NOT in that list\u2014board might show \"T\" for enemy tail at (6,4)? No, row 4: col6 is \".\" (positions: 0=.,1=T,2=T,3=T,4=T,5=.,6=A,7=.,8=.,9=). Wait, (6,4) is col6, which is \"A\"? No: row 4 string: \". T T T T . A . .\" so indices: 0=.,1=T,2=T,3=T,4=T,5=.,6=A,7=.,8=.,9= (assuming 10 chars). So (6,4) is col6? No, x=6, so index 6 is \"A\" (apple at (6,4)? But apple list has (5,1),(7,2), etc., no (6,4). Mistake: apples listed are (2,1),(1,9),(4,9),(4,8),(3,2),(3,7),(3,0),(9,3),(5,1),(3,3),(1,8),(9,9),(0,3),(7,2),(3,1). So (6,4) is not an apple\u2014must be empty? Board says \"A\" at col6 for row4? Wait, the board grid: row4: \". T T T T . A . .\" yes, after 5 dots/Ts, then \"A\" at col6. So (6,4) is \"A\"! That's an apple not in the apple drops list? Inconsistency, but I'll trust board: (6,4) is apple. But is it safe? Body not there, enemy not there (enemy bodies at x<=5). So LEFT to (6,4) is apple! Growth! But from there, options: UP to (6,5) is \"T\" (row5 col6? Row5: \". T . . T T . T T .\" so col6 is \"T\" enemy body). LEFT to (5,4) is \"T\" (enemy body). DOWN to (6,3) is \".\" (safe). So limited from (6,4).  \n4. **RIGHT to (8,4):** Board row4: \". T T T T . A . .\" so (8,4) is \".\" (empty). Safe? Self: (8,4) is currently our old head position, but our tail is at (7,8), and body is (8,4)? Wait, our body list: after growth, should be [(7,4) head, (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]? No, last move was LEFT from (8,4) to (7,4), so old head (8,4) becomes body, tail shifts if no eat? But we ate (7,4), so we grew, tail stays at (7,8). So current body includes (8,4). So moving RIGHT back to (8,4) is hitting our own body\u2014DEATH! \u274c Same as UP, can't reverse.  \n\n**ELIMINATION:**  \n- UP: DEAD (self).  \n- LEFT: SAFE, apple at (6,4)? But board shows \"A\", so yes. However, if it's not apple (apple list missing), still safe empty. Prioritize apples.  \n- RIGHT: DEAD (self).  \n- DOWN: SAFE, empty at (7,3), with apple at (7,2) below. No immediate growth, but opens path to multiple apples ((7,2),(3,0),(5,1), etc.).  \n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (6,4) for the apple\u2014growth to 7 apples, closer to enemy's 18! But is it truly apple? Board says yes, so GO. From there, pivot to (7,2) apple next. Aggression: we're boxing enemy from right, force them to turn into us if they chase apples left! CHAT, LET'S EAT AND DOMINATE!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: From (6,4) after eating, head DOWN to (7,2) for another apple, then LEFT toward (3,0) or (3,3) while keeping distance from enemy on left. Watch for enemy head (2,6)\u2014if they move right, we cut them off from below. Force collision only if we lead in apples after eating more!\n\nLEFT",

Left is blocked by your own neck.\n- Right gives a clean path toward the nearby apple cluster and keeps multiple escape lanes open. Up and Down also work, but Right lines you up for a future apple grab and central control.\n\nWhy RIGHT (3,6) now:\n- Keeps flexible corridors and avoids pinning yourself in a corner too soon. \ud83e\udded\n- Sets up a quick chase toward the apple at (3,7) next turn, which helps your already-healthy lead grow even more. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Maintains pressure in the center-left, so he can\u2019t breathe easy and might be forced into a mistake or a head-on later when you\u2019re ready.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (3,6) this turn. If you can, aim for (3,7) next turn to eat that apple and extend the lead.\n- After eating, keep your body layout to funnel him toward the edge or into a boxed corridor.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Keep trading space with him, never suicide into a trap.

Opponent snake #0 is massive (19 apples) with head at (3,7) and body wrapping left side. Score gap is huge: 6 vs 19, but we\u2019re not out\u2014we just need to play smart and aggressive.  \n\nBoard state shows our immediate moves:  \n- **UP to (6,4)**: That\u2019s our own body segment\u2014DEATH! \u274c  \n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: Empty (row 2: \u201c. . . A T . . A . .\u201d so (6,2) is \u201c.\u201d). No enemy body there (enemy bodies at x\u22645). Safe! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: Row 3: \u201cA T T A T T . . . A\u201d \u2192 (5,3) is \u201cT\u201d (enemy body). Enemy is there\u2014DEATH! \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: Empty (row 3: (7,3) is \u201c.\u201d). No self or enemy body. Safe! \u2705  \n\nSo we have two safe moves: DOWN to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,3).  \n\nNow, long-term strategy: We need apples to close the gap. Apples near us: (3,0), (5,1), (3,3). From (6,3):  \n- If we go DOWN to (6,2), we\u2019re closer to (5,1) (apple at row 1, col 5) and (3,0). Path open: from (6,2) \u2192 LEFT to (5,2) \u2192 LEFT to (4,2) \u2192 DOWN to (4,1) \u2192 LEFT to (3,0) or UP to (5,1). This routes us through bottom-left where enemy body is sparse (enemy main body is at y\u22651, x\u22645).  \n- If we go RIGHT to (7,3), we\u2019re heading to right side where apples are scarce: (9,3) and (8,2) are farther, but board shows (8,2) is apple? Actually apple list: (8,2) is listed, but board row 2: (8,2) is \u201cA\u201d (yes!). So RIGHT to (7,3) \u2192 RIGHT to (8,3) \u2192 DOWN to (8,2) to eat apple. But enemy is on left, so RIGHT might isolate us from main apple cluster and give enemy room to grow.  \n\nFor aggression: Enemy head at (3,7) likely moving toward right/top apples like (9,9), (4,9), (4,8). If we go DOWN, we can cut them off from below and force them into our tail if they chase. Score gap is big, so we want apples FAST\u2014DOWN gets us closer to (5,1) and (3,0) quickly. Also, from (6,2), we have more options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is back to (6,3) which will be our tail soon).  \n\nVerdict: DOWN to (6,2) is safer for growth and positioning. Let\u2019s eat those apples and box the enemy!  \n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

DOWN is a no-go (that\u2019s hitting your own neck).\n- I\u2019m picking RIGHT. It keeps us in a central corridor, lines up a clean path to the juicy stack on the 4th column (eat 4,8 then 4,9 in the next moves), and importantly presses the opponent toward the edge instead of giving him free space.\n- This move also preserves multiple follow-up options (we can zig from 4,7 to 4,8 or swing left if needed) while maintaining a solid cage-building potential around the center.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: push toward the apples on (4,8)/(4,9) to extend the lead, keep the opponent boxed in the right side, and avoid giving him an easy head-on line.\nLONG-TERM PLAN: maintain pressure, milk the lead by forcing mistakes, and if a clean head-on opens up, take it with the bigger score.\n\nMOVE:\nRIGHT",

A A . A . . . .\u201d so (6,1) is \u201c.\u201d \u2013 empty! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: Row 2 shows \u201c. . . A T . 1 A A .\u201d \u2013 (5,2) is \u201cT\u201d (enemy body)! Enemy is there \u2013 DEATH! \u274c  \n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: Row 2 shows (7,2) is \u201cA\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s an apple! But check: is it safe? Enemy bodies are mostly at x\u22645, so (7,2) should be clear. \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,2).  \n\n**Strategic deep dive:**  \n- **RIGHT to (7,2) eats an apple!** \ud83c\udf4e That would grow us to 7 apples, closing the gap slightly. Plus, it positions us closer to other apples: (8,2) is also an apple (from list), (9,3) is nearby. But the right side is open, and enemy is on the left/top.  \n- **DOWN to (6,1)** keeps us safe but doesn\u2019t grab an apple immediately. From (6,1), we could go LEFT to (5,1) which has an apple (listed: (5,1)), or RIGHT to (7,1) which might lead to (7,2) later.  \n\n**Aggression check:** Our score is 6 vs 19 \u2013 we NEED apples FAST to catch up! The apple at (7,2) is RIGHT there \u2013 why not take it? Also, moving RIGHT might pull us away from the enemy\u2019s massive body (which is currently coiled left of x=5). If we go RIGHT, we could start dominating the right side and force enemy into a corner.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \n- **RIGHT (7,2)**: Safe from self (no body parts at (7,2) currently). Safe from enemy (enemy body doesn\u2019t touch x=7). However, after eating the apple, we\u2019ll grow. Next turn, from (7,2) we could go UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2) (but that\u2019ll be our tail soon), or RIGHT to (8,2) which has another apple! That\u2019s a potential DOUBLE apple run!  \n- **DOWN (6,1)**: Also safe, but slower growth. From (6,1), we could go LEFT to (5,1) (apple!) or DOWN to (6,0), etc. But apple at (5,1) is closer than the cluster on the right? Actually, from (6,1) to (5,1) is one step left.  \n\n**Long-term plan:** The enemy is huge but likely slow \u2013 they might be heading to top-right apples like (9,9), (4,9), (4,8). If we take the right side now, we can eat (7,2), (8,2), (9,3), (9,9) and build up. Meanwhile, we can try to cut them off by positioning between their head and apple clusters. Since they have 19 apples, they\u2019re probably growing fast too \u2013 we need to stay aggressive and force a head-on collision ONLY if we have higher score (not yet!).  \n\n**Verdict:** RIGHT to (7,2) is the move! It gives us an immediate apple, keeps us safe, and opens up the right side for more growth. Let\u2019s GOOOO! \ud83d\ude80  \n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START RATIONALE**  \nWe\u2019re at turn 37, head (6,2), body as listed. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) gives us an apple. That\u2019s content! Then we\u2019ll have more options. Plan: After eating, move toward (8,2) next if safe, then (9,3). Force the enemy into the left side and box them in!

LEFT would smack into our neck at (3,7); DOWN would smack into our body at (4,6). So Safe options: UP or RIGHT.\n- Why UP first? It lets us immediately grab an apple at (4,8) and set up a vertical barrier along x=4 that tightens control of the central corridor. It also lines up a second apple at (4,9) for a quick growth streak without pulling us into open space near the opp.\n- Why not RIGHT now? It would hold space and keep us mobile, but it doesn\u2019t press the immediate apple gain as hard as UP does, and the goal is to cement the lead while forcing the rival toward the edge.\n\nShort-term plan (next 1\u20133 turns):\n- Move UP to (4,8) and eat the apple there. This increases our apples to 20, and keeps a tight vertical line along column 4 as we also push toward (4,9) on the following turn for another bite.\n- Maintain pressure on the center to discourage the opponent from crossing our path; use the growing body to cage the middle and funnel him toward the outer borders.\n- If the opportunity for a forced head-on with higher odds presents itself later, we\u2019ll take it, but the primary objective is safe growth while preserving options.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Continue expanding up the 4th column to form a stronger barrier trap, press toward the top edge to reduce escape routes for Snake #1, and look for induced mistakes from the rival to convert into head-on or collision opportunities while staying alive.\n- With a large lead, avoid reckless back-and-forth; prioritize lines that keep multiple escape options open and keep the rival boxed in longer.\n\nMOVE:\nUP",

A A\") \u2013 safe! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (7,1)**: Row 1 shows (7,1) is \".\" (empty) \u2013 safe! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (6,2)**: That's our own body segment (first in list) \u2013 DEATH! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (8,2)**: Board shows (8,2) is \"A\" (apple from apple list!) \u2013 safe from bodies? Enemy bodies max at x=5, so safe! \u2705\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is death)\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\n- **RIGHT to (8,2)** grabs ANOTHER apple immediately! That's 8 apples, closing gap faster! From (8,2), we'd have options to (8,3) (empty), (9,2) (apple from list!), or (7,2) (our tail will move). This keeps us on the apple highway right side!\n- **UP to (7,3)** is empty but no apple immediately. Could lead to (7,4) (our body!) later, limiting options.\n- **DOWN to (7,1)** is empty, could go to (6,1) or (8,1) but apples are sparse there.\n\n**Risk vs reward:** RIGHT gives immediate growth + positions for more apples. Enemy is on left/top, we're dominating right side. If we keep eating right-side apples, we might force enemy into a corner when they try to reach us!\n\n**Long-term plan:** Eat (8,2) now, then aim for (9,2) next, then (9,3). Build our length while boxing enemy left! If they come at us, we might have higher score soon for head-on collision!\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (8,2) for the apple!

We\u2019re going nuclear on aggression and cage control\u2014score pride, not chase vibes. Let\u2019s lock this down.\n\nDecision process (THOUGHTS, not fake news):\n- Evaluate all four directions from (4,8):\n  - UP -> (4,9): inside board, there\u2019s an apple at (4,9). Safe now; grows us taller and extends the central barrier. High-reward if we secure it.\n  - DOWN -> (4,7): runs into our neck/body (there\u2019s a segment at (4,7)). Not safe.\n  - LEFT -> (3,8): safe, but not immediate growth; maintains barrier options rather than expanding upward.\n  - RIGHT -> (5,8): safe, keeps options open but doesn\u2019t press the apple now.\n- Priority: maximize immediate growth while expanding our central barrier to corral Snake #1 and keep multiple safe follow-ups.\n- Opponent dynamics: with a ~23-apple gap, we can afford to press up and push the fight toward edges; head-on risk is real if we chase, but right now we\u2019re in control and want to enforce the wall.\n\nShort-term plan (turn 38\u201340):\n- Move UP to (4,9) and eat the apple there. This adds a new segment, grows our lead, and extends the barrier along column x=4 from the head down toward the tail (more wall to funnel Snake #1).\n- After the move, keep a tight vertical line on x=4 and monitor Snake #1\u2019s path. If he darts toward an edge or toward our line, be prepared to adjust with a safe lateral step (likely RIGHT) to maintain two escape routes.\n- Avoid any reckless reversals; stay on the pressure while ensuring the head never aligns with his path for a direct head-on unless the odds are in our favor.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Maintain the column 4 barrier, push him toward the top-right quadrant, and force missteps into walls or the edge.\n- Use the lead to force a high-odds head-on only if it guarantees a collision without sacrificing our safety.\n- If possible, engineer sequences that trap him into a corner or gap where one misstep ends the game for him.\n\nMOVE:\nUP",

Enemy snake #0's head is at (4,9) - they're way up top. Let's analyze this board LIVE!\n\n**Safety check from (8,2):**\n- **UP to (8,3)**: Board shows (8,3) is empty (row 3: \"A T T A T T T . A A\") - SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (8,1)**: Row 1 shows (8,1) is \".\" - SAFE! \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (7,2)**: That's our tail position (7,2) from previous turn, but wait... our body moves! Actually (7,2) will be empty after we move since tail moves last. However, checking enemy bodies - enemy #0 has segments at (4,2) and (4,3) but not near (7,2). So LEFT is potentially safe? But need to check if it's our own path...\n- **RIGHT to (9,2)**: Board shows (9,2) is \"A\" from apple list! Empty? Yes, apple at (9,2) is there - safe from bodies.\n\nWait, checking our body more carefully: Our body segments are [(8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5)] - but (8,2) is our current head. If we go LEFT to (7,2), that's currently our second body segment. When we move, our head moves first, then body follows. So if we go LEFT, our head would move into where our second body segment currently is - that's guaranteed death! Because when we move, our body segments shift, but the head moving into its own body segment is instant death. So LEFT is death.\n\n**Correct safety check:**\n- **UP (8,3)**: Empty - SAFE \u2705\n- **DOWN (8,1)**: Empty - SAFE \u2705\n- **LEFT (7,2)**: This is our own body segment (currently the first after head) - DEATH \u274c\n- **RIGHT (9,2)**: Apple at (9,2) - SAFE \u2705\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nWe have three safe moves. RIGHT gives immediate apple (9,2), but from there we'd be at (9,2) next turn with possible moves: UP to (9,3) (apple exists!), LEFT to (8,2) (our previous position but will be empty), DOWN to (9,1) (unknown). Could get trapped at right edge though.\n\nUP to (8,3) is empty, gets us closer to top-right where there are apples at (9,3) and (9,9). Also opens path to (9,3) next.\n\nDOWN to (8,1) goes toward bottom-left where apples are at (0,3), (1,2), (1,7), etc. Might be safer long-term but slower growth.\n\n**Aggressive play:** We need to close the 13-apple gap! RIGHT to (9,2) gives immediate growth to 9 apples. Then next turn we can go UP to (9,3) for another apple! That's 2 apples in 2 turns. Enemy is far away, not an immediate threat for head-on collision. Let's eat!\n\n**Plan:** RIGHT now to (9,2) for apple, then UP to (9,3) next. Build length, dominate right side.\n\nRIGHT",

Board state shows we're on the right edge - dangerous but also opportunities!\n\n**Safety check from (9,2):**\n- **UP to (9,3)**: Board shows \"A\" at (9,3) - that's an apple! No bodies there. SAFE \u2705\n- **DOWN to (9,1)**: Row 1 shows (9,1) is \".\" - SAFE \u2705\n- **LEFT to (8,2)**: Currently our body segment?

DEAD \u274c\n\n**Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT**\n\n**Strategic analysis:**\n- **UP to (9,3)** gets us an immediate apple (that's apple #10!) and positions us at (9,3). From there next turn: RIGHT is off-board, DOWN to (9,2) (our current spot, will be empty), LEFT to (8,3) (empty), UP to (9,4) (empty). Good options! Also closer to (9,9) apple.\n- **DOWN to (9,1)**: Empty, no apple. From there: LEFT to (8,1), UP to (9,2), DOWN to (9,0) (edge). Limited apple access immediately.\n- **LEFT to (8,2)**: Empty, no apple. From there: We could go UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2). Actually... (8,2) was our head before last move! But now it's empty.\n\n**Enemy analysis:** Snake #0 at (5,9) is far top-left. Their body snakes down to (4,3) area. They're not threatening our immediate moves.\n\n**GO FOR THE WIN PLAN:** We need apples FAST to close the 12-apple gap. UP to (9,3) gets us apple #10 immediately! Then we can work toward (9,9) for apple #11. This keeps us on the right edge where we have space to maneuver. Being aggressive with growth is our only path to victory - we can't play scared!\n\n**Tactical move:** UP to (9,3) - eat that apple and keep the momentum! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**  \nYo chat! Turn 41, and we're still trailing 10 vs 21 apples. We grew last turn to (9,3) - solid move, got that apple. Now head is at (9,3), body is [(9,2), (8,2), ...] and the tail is at (7,5).  \n\nLet's analyze moves from (9,3):  \n\n- **UP to (9,4)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). Safety check: our body isn't there, enemy body isn't there. Off-board? No. Backwards? Not into our own body (we came from (9,2)). So SAFE.  \n- **DOWN to (9,2)**: That's our current body segment (the one behind us). That's moving backwards into ourselves - DEAD. Can't do that.  \n- **LEFT to (8,3)**: Board shows \".\" (empty). Our body? No. Enemy? Snake #0 has no segments there. SAFE.  \n- **RIGHT to (10,3)**: Off-board, DEAD.  \n\nSo only safe moves: UP to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,3).  \n\nNow strategic: We need apples FAST to close the gap. Where are apples on the board? From the list:  \n(2,1), (1,9), (3,2), (3,0), (5,1), (3,3), (1,8), (9,9), (0,3), (3,1), (8,3), (1,2), (1,7), (8,9), (5,0).  \n\nLooking at board state: (8,3) shows \"A\" in the board! Wait, check board state again:  \nRow 3: \"A T T A . T T . A 1\" (that's y=3, from x=0 to 9). At x=8, y=3? The row: indices: 0:A,1:T,2:T,3:A,4:.,5:T,6:T,7:.,8:A,9:1. So at (8,3) there's an \"A\" (apple). But our head is at (9,3) which is \"1\". So (8,3) has apple!  \n\nThus moving LEFT to (8,3) would eat an apple and grow. That's huge - we need apples.  \n\nUP to (9,4) is empty (row 4 shows \"T T T T T T T T .\" - at x=9, row 4 shows \".\" actually row 4: \" . T T T T T T T T .\" - wait let's read row 4: \"4 . T T T T T T T T .\" That means (9,4) is \".\" (the last character before the dot? Actually coordinates: x=0 to 9. So positions:  \nx=0: \".\"  \nx=1: \"T\"  \nx=2: \"T\"  \nx=3: \"T\"  \nx=4: \"T\"  \nx=5: \"T\"  \nx=6: \"T\"  \nx=7: \"T\"  \nx=8: \"T\"  \nx=9: \".\"? Wait the string: \" . T T T T T T T T .\" That's 10 characters? Let's count: characters: space, ., space, T, space, T, space, T, space, T, space, T, space, T, space, T, space, T, space, .? That seems like 19 characters. Actually board state is given as a grid of 10x10 characters with spaces. Let's parse row 4 correctly:  \n\"4 . T T T T T T T T .\" That's likely: (0,4) = \".\", (1,4) = \"T\", (2,4) = \"T\", (3,4) = \"T\", (4,4) = \"T\", (5,4) = \"T\", (6,4) = \"T\", (7,4) = \"T\", (8,4) = \"T\", (9,4) = \".\"? Wait the pattern: after \"4 \" there's \". T T T T T T T T .\" So that's 10 symbols: index0: ., index1: T, index2: T, index3: T, index4: T, index5: T, index6: T, index7: T, index8: T, index9: .? Actually the string ends with \" .\" so maybe (9,4) is \".\" indeed. So UP to (9,4) is empty, no apple.  \n\nThus LEFT to (8,3) gets us an apple immediately. That's a no-brainer: we need growth.  \n\nAlso, we should consider future positioning. If we go LEFT to (8,3), we eat apple, grow. Next turn, from (8,3) we'll have options: UP (8,4) is \"T\" (snake body? Actually (8,4) is \"T\" - that's likely our own body? Wait our body: from head (9,3) to tail. Let's list our body segments:  \nHead: (9,3)  \nBody: (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5).  \nSo (8,4) is indeed our own body segment (the 8th element). So UP from (8,3) would go into our own body? That would be deadly next turn unless we move differently. But we can plan.  \n\nFrom (8,3) after eating apple, we could go DOWN to (8,2) - that's also our body (second segment). LEFT to (7,3) - board shows (7,3) is \".\" (row 3: at x=7 is \".\"? Row 3: \"A T T A . T T . A 1\" - positions: x=0:A,1:T,2:T,3:A,4:.,5:T,6:T,7:.,8:A,9:1. So (7,3) is \".\" empty. RIGHT to (9,3) would be our previous spot (now empty after moving). So we have options.  \n\nUP to (9,4) is safe but no apple, and from there we could go to (9,5) which is \"T\" (our body? Check (9,5): row 5: \" . T . . T T . T T .\" - that's x=0:.,1:T,2:.,3:.,4:T,5:T,6:.,7:T,8:T,9:.? Actually string: \"5 . T . . T T . T T .\" That's 10 symbols: index0: ., index1: T, index2: ., index3: ., index4: T, index5: T, index6: ., index7: T, index8: T, index9: . So (9,5) is \".\" (the last character before the dot? Wait after \"5 \" there's \". T . . T T . T T .\" That's 10 symbols: positions: 0:.,1:T,2:.,3:.,4:T,5:T,6:.,7:T,8:T,9:. So (9,5) is actually \".\"? Let's map: The pattern: after \"5 \" there's a dot, then space, then T, etc. Actually it's easier: The board is displayed with spaces between characters, so we can take the string as is. Row 5: \"5 . T . . T T . T T .\" So ignoring the \"5 \" at start, the characters: ., T, ., ., T, T, ., T, T, . So x=0:., x=1:T, x=2:., x=3:., x=4:T, x=5:T, x=6:., x=7:T, x=8:T, x=9:. So (9,5) is the last character: \".\" (dot). So (9,5) is empty. So from (9,4) we could go UP to (9,5) empty. But no apple there.  \n\nThe apple at (8,3) is immediate. We must prioritize growth to close the gap. Also, we need to consider enemy. Snake #0 head at (6,9), body extends down to (4,3) etc. They might move toward apples too, but we need to focus on our own growth.  \n\nWe should also think about boxing in the enemy. But with a huge deficit, we need apples first.  \n\nThus move: LEFT to (8,3) to eat apple.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is at (6,9) and could move toward us. We should be aggressive and try to cut off their access to apples, but first we need growth. Plan: after eating, move LEFT toward central apples, then DOWN toward bottom apples if safe. Keep path open. If enemy approaches, consider head-on collision later when we have higher score (we need +10 more apples to catch up, so not yet). For now, survive and grow.\n\n**Move rationale:**  \nWe need apples urgently to close the 11 vs 21 gap. From (9,3), moving LEFT to (8,3) eats an apple (+1 point, grow to 12). That's the only safe move that gives immediate growth. UP to (9,4) is safe but no apple. DOWN is into our own body, RIGHT is off-board. So LEFT is the optimal play.

They\u2019re effectively boxed in by their own tail/segments. This turn looks ripe for their collapse, which we can leverage to run the score up and stay spotless.\n\n- My read on the plan:\n  - We\u2019re ahead 21 apples to 11. Pressure + smart spacing > reckless head-on. Since they\u2019re effectively stuck, we want to maximize safe expansion and keep doors open for future traps without risking our neck.\n  - The strongest concrete cue is to slide to the right to (8,8). It keeps us away from immediate danger, positions us near the top-right apple cluster, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups next turn.\n\n- Short-term plan (turns 44+):\n  - If opponent collapses this turn, we focus on maintaining the top-right corridor, using the edge to funnel any stray moves into safe zones, avoid bottlenecks, and stay ready for a potential final clutch.\n  - If they somehow survive, we\u2019ll continue to pressure by zigging toward the center while avoiding tight corners that trap us.\n\n- Confidence check: RIGHT to (8,8) looks clean\u2014no body collision now, no edge escape risk, and it preserves space for future maneuvers while we ride the lead. \ud83e\udde0\u26a1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s break it down.**\n\n**Current board:**  \nMy head at (7,3), body snakes from (8,3) all the way back to (8,5). Enemy head at (7,8), body wrapping around the top-left. Apples scattered everywhere, but we\u2019re not hunting apples\u2014we\u2019re hunting the enemy\u2019s weakness.  \n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**  \n- **From (7,3), possible moves:**  \n  - **UP to (7,4):** That\u2019s my own body (part of the tail, see board: row 4, col 7 is \u2018T\u2019). DEAD.  \n  - **DOWN to (7,2):** My own body (row 2, col 7 is \u2018T\u2019). DEAD.  \n  - **LEFT to (6,3):** Empty? Check board: row 3, col 6 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body, part of tail). WAIT\u2014board shows row 3: \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d \u2014 that \u2018T\u2019 at col 6 is my body! So LEFT is into my own body. DEAD.  \n  - **RIGHT to (8,3):** That\u2019s empty! (From board: row 3, col 8 is \u2018T\u2019? Let\u2019s verify. Row 3: \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d \u2014 positions: 0:A,1:T,2:T,3:A,4:.,5:.,6:T,7:1,8:T,9:T. So col 8 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body). But wait\u2014my body list shows (8,3) as part of my body, but it\u2019s the segment behind my head? Actually, my head is at (7,3). The body list: (7,3) head, (8,3), (9,3), etc. So (8,3) is indeed my body. So RIGHT is into my own body. DEAD.  \n\n**HOLD UP\u2014EVERY MOVE IS DEAD?**  \nThat can\u2019t be right. Let\u2019s re-examine the board carefully.  \n\n**Board state key:**  \nRow 3 (y=3): \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d  \nColumns:  \n0: A (apple)  \n1: T (my body? Wait, my body at (1,3) is not in my snake list. My snake body is from (8,3) to (8,5). So (1,3) is enemy snake? Actually enemy snake #0 has a body at (2,3) and (1,3)? Let\u2019s check enemy body: \u201c1, 3\u201d is in the list? Yes: \u201c(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\u201d. So (1,3) is enemy body. So row 3 col 1 is T (enemy).  \nSo row 3 col 2 is T (enemy body? Actually enemy has (2,3) and (1,3), so col 2 is empty? Wait board says \u201cT\u201d at col 2. Hmm.  \nBut my own body: I have (8,3) which is col 8 row 3, and (6,3) which is col 6 row 3. So row 3 col 6 is my body (T).  \n\nNow, from my head (7,3):  \n- **UP (7,4):** Row 4 col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body, from list (7,4)). So yes, into my own body.  \n- **DOWN (7,2):** Row 2 col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body, from list (7,2)). So yes, into my own body.  \n- **LEFT (6,3):** Row 3 col 6 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body, (6,3)). So into my own body.  \n- **RIGHT (8,3):** Row 3 col 8 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body, (8,3)). So into my own body.  \n\n**EVERY MOVE IS INTO MY OWN BODY?** That means I\u2019m trapped? But that can\u2019t be\u2014maybe I misread the body list. Let\u2019s re-list my body:  \nHead: (7,3)  \nBody: [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)]  \nSo the segment in front of head is (8,3) (to the right). Behind head is (6,3)? No, the list is head-to-tail, so after head (7,3), the next is (8,3) (right), then (9,3), etc. So the tail is (8,5).  \n\nSo from (7,3), the immediate adjacent cells:  \n- Right (8,3) is body (second segment) \u2192 can\u2019t go there (would hit own body).  \n- Left (6,3) is also a body segment? Let\u2019s see: the list includes (6,3) later. Yes, (6,3) is in the body list. So left is also body.  \n- Up (7,4) is body (ninth segment).  \n- Down (7,2) is body (fifth segment).  \n\nSo indeed, I\u2019m completely surrounded by my own body. But wait\u2014this is impossible because snakes move simultaneously and I just moved last turn from (9,3) to (7,3)? Actually, my last move was LEFT from (9,3) to (8,3)? No, the replay says last move was LEFT, but my head is now at (7,3). Hmm.  \n\nLet\u2019s check the replay:  \n**--YOUR LAST MOVE (LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP):--**  \n**START LAST MOVE PICK**  \nLEFT  \n**END LAST MOVE PICK**  \n\nBut my head is at (7,3). If I was at (9,3) last turn, moving LEFT would go to (8,3), not (7,3). Something\u2019s off. Maybe the head moved two steps? No, each turn only one step.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe I misread the head. The input says:  \n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**  \n- **Head: (7, 3)**  \n- **Body: [(8, 3), (9, 3), ...]**  \n\nSo head is (7,3), and the first body segment is (8,3) (to the right). That means last turn I was at (8,3) and moved LEFT to (7,3)? But (8,3) is in the body list, so that can\u2019t be. Unless the body list includes the previous head position? In snake games, the body list usually includes all segments except the current head. But here it says \u201cHEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\u201d So the list includes the head at the front. So head (7,3), then (8,3) is the next segment. So (8,3) is immediately behind the head? That would mean the head moved from (8,3) to (7,3) last turn, and (8,3) is now the first body segment. That makes sense: I moved LEFT from (8,3) to (7,3). So my previous head was (8,3). That aligns with last turn\u2019s move being LEFT.  \n\nNow, from (7,3), the cells:  \n- Left (6,3): Is that empty? The body list includes (6,3) but that\u2019s further down the tail. The segment immediately to the left of (7,3) is (6,3)? But (6,3) is in the body list, but is it adjacent? Yes, because the body list is connected: (7,3) \u2192 (8,3) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 ... So (6,3) is not immediately adjacent to (7,3) because there\u2019s (8,3) in between? Wait, no: (7,3) is connected to (8,3) (right). (6,3) is connected to (6,2) and (6,4), not directly to (7,3). So (6,3) is not adjacent to (7,3). The only adjacent body segments are:  \n  - Right: (8,3) (immediate next segment)  \n  - Others: (7,2) is below, but is that adjacent? Yes, (7,2) is directly below (7,3). And (7,4) is above.  \n\nFrom the body list, (7,2) and (7,4) are in the list. So indeed, (7,3) is surrounded: left (6,3) might be empty? Let\u2019s check the board.  \n\nBoard row 3: \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d  \nCol 6 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body). So (6,3) is occupied by my body. But is it adjacent to (7,3)? Yes, left is (6,3). So left is body.  \nRow 3 col 8 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body), so right is body.  \nRow 4 col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body), so up is body.  \nRow 2 col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body), so down is body.  \n\nSo I\u2019m completely boxed in by my own body. That means I have no safe moves? But that can\u2019t be\u2014I must have misread something. Perhaps the board representation is from a previous turn? No, it\u2019s the current state.  \n\nWait, maybe I can move into my own body if it\u2019s the tail? No, the rule says: \u201cMove into ANY snake\u2019s body (including your own)? You\u2019re DEAD.\u201d So all moves are death.  \n\nBut that\u2019s impossible\u2014there must be a mistake. Let\u2019s double-check the body list order. The body list is head-to-tail, so the head is first. The head is at (7,3). The next segment (8,3) is directly to the right. Then (9,3) is right of (8,3). Then (9,2) is down from (9,3). Then (8,2) is left from (9,2). Then (7,2) is left from (8,2). Then (6,2) is left from (7,2). Then (6,3) is up from (6,2). Then (6,4) is up from (6,3). Then (7,4) is right from (6,4). Then (8,4) is right from (7,4). Then (8,5) is up from (8,4).  \n\nSo the body forms a loop? Not exactly, but it\u2019s tight.  \n\nNow, from (7,3), the only adjacent cells are:  \n- (8,3): body segment (immediately after head)  \n- (6,3): body segment (but not directly connected to head, but still part of body)  \n- (7,4): body segment (connected to (6,4) and (8,4))  \n- (7,2): body segment (connected to (6,2) and (8,2))  \n\nAll are occupied by my own body. So indeed, every move is into my own body \u2192 death.  \n\nBut wait\u2014there\u2019s an apple at (7,3)? No, (7,3) is my head, not an apple. Apples are listed: (2,1), (1,9), etc. Not (7,3).  \n\nSo if I move, I die. But the game must allow me to move\u2014I can\u2019t be stuck. Unless I made a mistake and one of those cells is actually empty? Let\u2019s look at the board again:  \n\nRow 3: \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d  \nColumns: 0:A, 1:T, 2:T, 3:A, 4:., 5:., 6:T, 7:1, 8:T, 9:T  \n\nSo at (7,3) (col 7, row 3) is \u20181\u2019 (my head).  \n- Left (6,3) is col 6, row 3: \u2018T\u2019 (my body)  \n- Right (8,3) is col 8, row 3: \u2018T\u2019 (my body)  \n- Up (7,4) is col 7, row 4: from row 4: \u201c. T T T T . T T T .\u201d so col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body)  \n- Down (7,2) is col 7, row 2: from row 2: \u201c. A . A . . T T T T\u201d so col 7 is \u2018T\u2019 (my body)  \n\nYes, all four directions are my body. So I have no legal move? That can\u2019t be\u2014maybe I can move off the board? No, that\u2019s death.  \n\nPerhaps I misread the rules: \u201cMoving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That\u2019s hitting yourself.\u201d But here, all directions are into my body, not just backwards.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe the body list doesn\u2019t include the entire snake? No, it says \u201cbody: [list]\u201d and it\u2019s head-to-tail.  \n\nThis is a crisis. But maybe I missed that one of those cells is actually empty because the body moved last turn? No, snakes move simultaneously, so the board is after all moves.  \n\nPerhaps the enemy snake could be moving into my body? But that doesn\u2019t help me\u2014I\u2019d still die if I move into my own body.  \n\nUnless... the rule says: \u201cAnother snake\u2019s head moves into YOUR body? THEY die. Your body stays. You survived the clutch!\u201d So if I move into my own body, I die. If enemy moves into my body, they die. But I still die if I move into my own body.  \n\nSo I have to choose a move that doesn\u2019t kill me. But all moves kill me.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe (6,3) is not part of my body? Let\u2019s check the body list again:  \nBody: [(8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]  \nYes, (6, 3) is there. So (6,3) is my body.  \n\nBut is (6,3) adjacent to (7,3)? Yes, left.  \n\nSo all four directions are occupied by my body.  \n\nThis seems like a bug, but maybe I\u2019m supposed to pick a move anyway, and I\u2019ll die. But the game might have a rule that if you have no safe moves, you die? But the prompt says \u201cpick ONE move - UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\u201d So I have to pick one.  \n\nPerhaps I should pick a move that might kill me but if the enemy moves in a certain way, I survive? No, moving into my own body is death regardless of what enemy does.  \n\nUnless the enemy moves into that same cell and we have a head-on collision? But that cell is my body, not an enemy head. For head-on collision, both heads move into the same cell. Here, my head moving into my own body is not a head-on collision\u2014it\u2019s just suicide.  \n\nSo I\u2019m dead no matter what. But the game must have allowed this state\u2014maybe I made a mistake in previous moves.  \n\nLet\u2019s think: last turn, I was at (8,3) and moved LEFT to (7,3). Was (7,3) empty? Yes, it was empty last turn (since I moved into it). Now, after moving, my body follows: the old head becomes body, and the tail moves. So after moving to (7,3), my body should be: new head (7,3), then old head (8,3), then (9,3), etc. So indeed, (8,3) is now body.  \n\nBut why is (6,3) body? Because the tail didn\u2019t move? In snake, when you move, the tail moves forward (unless you eat an apple). I didn\u2019t eat an apple last turn? Last move was from (8,3) to (7,3), and (8,3) was an apple? No, the apple list shows (8,3) is not in the apple list. Apples are at (2,1), (1,9), etc. So I didn\u2019t eat last turn. So the tail should have moved forward.  \n\nLet\u2019s simulate:  \nBefore move: head at (8,3), body: [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)]  \nBut wait, that list includes (8,3) as head and body? That\u2019s impossible\u2014the head should not be in the body list. Usually, the body list excludes the head. But the prompt says: \u201cHEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\u201d So the list includes the head at position 0, then segment 1, segment 2, etc. So the head is at (7,3) now, and the first body segment is (8,3) (the previous head). So the body list includes the previous head positions.  \n\nSo before move, head was (8,3), body list: [(8,3), (9,3), ...] but that would mean the head is also the first body segment? That\u2019s confusing.  \n\nMaybe the body list provided is for the current state, and it includes the current head as the first element. So current head is (7,3), body list starts with (8,3) (immediately behind). So the body list does not include the head. That makes more sense.  \n\nSo current body: [(8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)]  \nHead: (7,3)  \n\nNow, adjacent cells to head (7,3):  \n- (8,3): body segment (immediately behind)  \n- (6,3): body segment (see list, (6,3) is in the list)  \n- (7,4): body segment (in list)  \n- (7,2): body segment (in list)  \n\nAll are body. So indeed, no safe moves.  \n\nBut wait\u2014when the snake moves, the tail moves forward (if no apple eaten). So from the previous state, after moving left from (8,3) to (7,3), the tail at (8,5) should move forward, so (8,5) might become empty? But in the current body list, (8,5) is still there. Let\u2019s see the order: tail is (8,5). The body list is head-to-tail, so tail is last: (8,5). When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, and the new head is added. So the body list should shrink by one? No, the length stays the same unless eating.  \n\nI\u2019m confused. Let\u2019s step back.  \n\nMaybe I have to consider that the enemy might move into one of those body cells, and if they do, they die, but I still die if I move there.  \n\nUnless the rule is: if I move into a cell that was my body but my tail moves away, then it\u2019s empty? But we move simultaneously, so the tail moves at the same time.  \n\nIn standard snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was the tail becomes empty. But if that cell is adjacent to the head, it might become available for the head to move into? No, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves from its current cell, so the cell that was the tail is now empty, but the head is not moving into it\u2014it\u2019s moving into a different cell.  \n\nIn this case, my head is at (7,3). The tail is at (8,5). When I move, the tail moves forward along the body. So the cell (8,5) might become empty, but that\u2019s not adjacent to (7,3).  \n\nI think there\u2019s a misunderstanding. In the current state, my snake is in a position where every adjacent cell is occupied by my own body. That means I\u2019m trapped and will die on my next move regardless. But the game might have intended for me to have an escape, or I misplotted.  \n\nGiven the board state, perhaps (6,3) is not actually occupied? Let\u2019s look at the board again: row 3, col 6 is \u2018T\u2019. What does \u2018T\u2019 stand for? Probably \u201ctail\u201d or \u201cbody\u201d. But for which snake? The board legend isn\u2019t given, but likely \u2018T\u2019 for my snake\u2019s body, \u20180\u2019 for enemy head, \u2018A\u2019 for apple, etc.  \n\nIn row 3, we have \u201cA T T A . . T 1 T T\u201d. The \u20181\u2019 is my head. The \u2018T\u2019s are my body. So yes, (6,3) is my body.  \n\nBut wait, the enemy snake #0 also has a body. Could some \u2018T\u2019s be enemy body? The board doesn\u2019t distinguish between snakes. The enemy snake body might be marked as \u2018T\u2019 as well. But the prompt says \u201cBoard state\u201d with letters: \u2018A\u2019 for apple, \u2018T\u2019 for snake body (probably both snakes), \u20180\u2019 for enemy head, \u20181\u2019 for my head. So \u2018T\u2019 could be either snake\u2019s body.  \n\nThat changes everything! If \u2018T\u2019 is just \u201ca snake body (either mine or enemy\u2019s)\u201d, then (6,3) might be enemy body, not mine. But the body list says (6,3) is in my body. So it is mine.  \n\nBut the board might not show the distinction. However, the body list is explicit: (6,3) is my body.  \n\nI think I have to accept that I have no safe move and will die. But that can\u2019t be the intended play\u2014maybe I missed an apple. Let\u2019s check if there\u2019s an apple at (7,3) that I ate last turn? The apple list doesn\u2019t include (7,3). Apples are at (2,1), (1,9), (3,2), (3,0), (5,1), (3,3), (1,8), (9,9), (0,3), (3,1), (1,2), (1,7), (8,9), (5,0), (2,7). No (7,3). So I didn\u2019t eat.  \n\nPerhaps I can move off the board? No.  \n\nMaybe the rule is that if you have no safe moves, you lose, but you still have to pick a direction. So I have to pick one and die.  \n\nBut let\u2019s consider the enemy. Enemy head at (7,8). They might move into my body? But that doesn\u2019t save me.  \n\nPerhaps I can force a head-on collision by moving into a cell where the enemy head will be? But I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll move.  \n\nGiven that I have no safe moves, I might as well pick a move that could kill the enemy if they move into that cell. But since I\u2019m moving into my own body, I\u2019ll die regardless. Unless the enemy moves into that same cell and it\u2019s a head-on collision? But for head-on collision, both heads must move into the same cell. Here, I\u2019m moving into a body cell, not an empty cell. The enemy head could move into that same cell, but that cell is occupied by my body, so if enemy head moves into my body, they die (rule: \u201cAnother snake\u2019s head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\u201d). So if I move into (6,3) (my body), and enemy head moves into (6,3), I die because I moved into my own body, and enemy dies because they moved into my body. But since both die, if we die on the same turn, we compare apples. I have 11, they have 21, so they win.  \n\nIf I move into (6,3) and enemy does not move into (6,3), I die alone.  \n\nSo either way, I die.  \n\nThis is a disaster. But maybe I miscalculated the adjacency. Let\u2019s list all cells adjacent to (7,3) and see if any are not in my body list:  \n- (7,4): my body? Body list includes (7,4). Yes.  \n- (7,2): my body? Yes.  \n- (6,3): my body? Yes.  \n- (8,3): my body? Yes.  \n\nAll are in my body list. So no escape.  \n\nPerhaps the body list is wrong? Or the board is wrong? I have to trust the given data.  \n\nGiven this, I have to choose a move. Let\u2019s pick LEFT to (6,3) since that\u2019s the direction I\u2019ve been moving, and maybe the enemy will move away. But I\u2019ll die.  \n\nWait\u2014could it be that (6,3) is not actually occupied because my tail moves? In standard snake, when you move, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was the tail becomes empty. But (6,3) is not the tail\u2014the tail is (8,5). So (6,3) remains occupied.  \n\nI think I have to accept that this is a losing position. But the game must continue, so I\u2019ll pick a direction and explain.  \n\n**Move rationale:**  \nI\u2019m completely surrounded by my own body. Every possible move leads to death. However, I must pick a direction. I\u2019ll choose LEFT to (6,3) because it\u2019s the direction I\u2019ve been trending, and if the enemy snake accidentally moves into (6,3), they\u2019ll die, but I\u2019ll still die. Given my low score compared to the enemy, forcing a mutual death might be better than dying alone, but since they have more apples, they\u2019d win the tie. Still, it\u2019s all I can do.  \n\n**Final decision:**  \nLEFT  \n\n**But wait\u2014could there be a misinterpretation? Let\u2019s check the board once more. Row 3, col 4 is \u2018.\u2019 (empty). But that\u2019s not adjacent to (7,3). Col 4 is two steps left. No.  \n\nPerhaps (7,3) has an apple I didn\u2019t see? The board shows \u20181\u2019 at (7,3), no apple.  \n\nI think I have to go with LEFT.  \n\nBut the prompt says \u201cAmong remaining SAFE moves\u201d\u2014but there are no safe moves. So I have to pick any move.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick LEFT.  \n\n**Final answer:**  \nLEFT  \n\nBut let\u2019s make sure: the last word must be exactly UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. So I\u2019ll say LEFT.  \n\nHowever, before that, I need to include a plan for future turns, even though I\u2019m likely dead.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nIf I survive (unlikely), I need to immediately head toward an apple to grow and get out of this tight space. But with every move death, I might be dead. If I die, game over. But since the game continues if I die? No, if I die, I\u2019m out. But the prompt says \u201cIf ALL snakes die on the same turn, game ends immediately.\u201d So if I die alone, opponent wins. If both die, we compare apples.  \n\nGiven that, I should try to lure the enemy into a collision. From (7,3), if I move LEFT, and enemy moves DOWN from (7,8) to (7,7), no collision. But if enemy moves LEFT to (6,8), no. To collide, enemy would need to move to (6,3), which is unlikely.  \n\nMaybe I can move UP? But (7,4) is my body. Same issue.  \n\nI think I have to accept the inevitable.  \n\n**Move rationale:**  \nI\u2019m trapped with no safe moves. Every direction leads into my own body, resulting in death. I\u2019m choosing LEFT to (6,3) to at least keep the possibility of the enemy moving into that cell (though unlikely). If the enemy moves into (6,3), they die, and since we both die, I lose due to lower apples. But it\u2019s my only option. This is a tough spot\u2014we need to be more careful in the future to avoid boxing ourselves in.  \n\n**Final decision:**  \nLEFT  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nNow, the last line must be exactly the move. So:  \n\nLEFT",
