The apples are spread out, with some near the top and bottom edges.\n- The enemy snake is at (7, 3), which is to the right and slightly above the snake's head.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Move to (2, 5)\n   - Check if this is safe:\n     - No snake body or apple in (2, 5) (from the board state, it's empty).\n     - No immediate danger from enemy or own body.\n   - This move is safe.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (3, 4)\n   - Check if this is safe:\n     - No snake body or apple in (3, 4) (empty).\n     - No immediate danger from enemy or own body.\n   - This move is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (1, 4)\n   - Check if this is safe:\n     - No snake body or apple in (1, 4) (empty).\n     - No immediate danger from enemy or own body.\n   - This move is safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 4)\n   - Wait, this is the same as DOWN. I think I made a mistake here. Let's correct that:\n   - **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 4) is the same as DOWN. Actually, moving right from (2, 4) would be (3, 4), which is the same as DOWN. That's incorrect. Correcting:\n   - **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 4) is not correct. Moving right from (2, 4) is (3, 4) which is the same as DOWN. Wait, no, moving right from (2, 4) is (3, 4) is incorrect because moving right increases x-coordinate. So, (2, 4) + right = (3, 4). Wait, no, moving right from (2, 4) is (3, 4) is correct. But that's the same as DOWN. I think I'm confusing myself here. Let's clarify:\n\n   - **RIGHT**: (2, 4) + right = (3, 4)\n   - **DOWN**: (2, 4) + down = (3, 4) (no, wait, down increases y-coordinate, so (2, 4) + down = (2, 5). Wait, no, down is decreasing y-coordinate, so (2, 4) + down = (2, 3). I think I messed up the coordinate system.\n\n   Let me clarify:\n   - Increasing y-coordinate is up, decreasing y-coordinate is down.\n   - Increasing x-coordinate is right, decreasing x-coordinate is left.\n\n   So:\n   - **UP**: (2, 4) -> (2, 5)\n   - **DOWN**: (2, 4) -> (2, 3)\n   - **LEFT**: (2, 4) -> (1, 4)\n   - **RIGHT**: (2, 4) -> (3, 4)\n\n   So my initial analysis was correct.\n\n### Safe Moves:\nAll four directions are safe at this moment.\n\n### Next Step: Evaluate which move is best.\n\n#### Apple Proximity:\n- The closest apple is at (5, 4), which is 3 steps away diagonally (not directly reachable in one move).\n- The next closest apple is (2, 8), which is 4 steps away vertically.\n- The apple at (5, 8) is also far away.\n- The apple at (8, 0) is far away.\n\n#### Snake Movement:\n- Enemy snake is at (7, 3). If we move right to (3, 4), the enemy snake will move towards us. If we move left to (1, 4), the enemy snake will move towards us as well.\n- If we move up or down, the enemy snake will not immediately threaten us.\n\n#### Future Options:\n- Moving up or down keeps the snake in a more central position, allowing more flexibility in future moves.\n- Moving left or right could lead to the snake being more exposed to the enemy snake.\n\n#### Apple Eating:\n- The snake is currently at (2, 4). The apple at (5, 4) is directly ahead if we move right, but it's not immediately reachable in one move.\n- Moving up to (2, 5) is safe and keeps the snake in a position where it can potentially reach apples more easily in the future.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- Avoid moving directly towards the enemy snake.\n- Keep the snake in a position where it can safely grow and avoid collisions.\n- Prioritize moves that keep the snake in a central area, allowing for more flexibility.\n\n### Decision:\nMoving **UP** to (2, 5) is the safest and most strategic move. It keeps the snake in a central position and avoids immediate threats from the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

If we move **UP** to (2,5), the enemy could move toward us (e.g., UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,3)), but no immediate collision is guaranteed.\n   - If we move **LEFT** to (1,6) or **DOWN** to (3,6), the enemy could still approach from the right or top, but the distance is slightly longer.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** to (3,6) risks the enemy closing in faster (e.g., if it moves UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,3), it could collide with us if we move right).\n\n2. **Apple Proximity**:\n   - The closest apple is (5,4), which is **3 steps away** (directly right).\n   - Other apples are farther away (e.g., (2,8) is 4 steps up).\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Considerations**\n- **Avoid getting trapped**: Since we have no body segments, moving in a straight line (e.g., UP or RIGHT) is safer than turning sharply (e.g., LEFT or DOWN), as it reduces the risk of colliding with the enemy or ourselves.\n- **Prioritize UP/DOWN**: These moves keep the snake in a central position and avoid immediate enemy threats.\n- **Watch enemy movement**: If the enemy moves UP, we should avoid moving DOWN, and vice versa.\n\n### **Optimal Move Analysis**\n- **UP to (2,5)**:\n  - Keeps the snake in a central position.\n  - Avoids immediate enemy threats.\n  - Allows future flexibility to reach apples like (5,4) or (2,8) without being trapped.\n  - The enemy cannot immediately collide with us if it moves away from us.\n\n- **DOWN to (3,6)**:\n  - Keeps distance from the enemy but reduces flexibility for future moves.\n  - The enemy could still approach from the top, but the risk is slightly higher.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**:\n  - Reduces flexibility and could be risky if the enemy moves toward us from the right.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,6)**:\n  - Risks the enemy closing in faster, especially if it moves UP or RIGHT.\n\n### **Final Decision**\nMoving **UP** to (2,5) is the safest and most strategic choice.

Snake State Recap**\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (3, 6)\n  - Body: [(3, 7)] (tail)\n  - Apples collected: 1\n- **Enemy (Snake #0):**\n  - Head: (5, 6)\n  - Body: [(4, 6)]\n  - Apples: 1\n\n#### **2. Board State & Apple Locations**\n- **Apples at:**\n  - (7, 7), (8, 0), (5, 8), (8, 6), (5, 0)\n- **Closest apple to your head (3,6): (7,7)** (2 moves away: DOWN \u2192 DOWN)\n- **Enemy\u2019s likely next moves (from last rationale):**\n  - UP to (5, 3) or LEFT to (4, 6)\n\n#### **3. Safe Moves (Eliminating Immediate Death)**\n- **UP (2, 6):**\n  - **Risk:** Enemy could move UP to (5, 3), then collide with your head at (2, 6) in the next turn.\n  - **Also:** If enemy moves LEFT to (4, 6), your head at (2, 6) is safe, but you\u2019re not progressing toward (7,7).\n  - **Conclusion:** **Not ideal** due to potential future collision.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 7):**\n  - **Risk:** None against enemy\u2019s current position (head at (5,6), body at (4,6)).\n  - **Follow-up moves:** From (4,7), you can safely move DOWN to (5,7) next turn, then DOWN to (6,7), then DOWN to (7,7) (apple).\n  - **Pros:** Direct path to (7,7), avoids immediate threats.\n  - **Cons:** Slightly slower than LEFT (but LEFT risks blocking access to (7,7)).\n\n- **LEFT (2, 6):**\n  - **Risk:** If enemy moves LEFT to (4,6), your head at (2,6) is safe, but you\u2019re not progressing toward (7,7).\n  - **Also:** If you move LEFT now, your body at (3,7) could be blocked by enemy\u2019s body at (4,6) in the next turn if enemy moves UP.\n  - **Conclusion:** **Risky** unless you\u2019re sure enemy won\u2019t move UP.\n\n- **RIGHT (4, 6):**\n  - **Risk:** Enemy\u2019s body is at (4,6), so moving RIGHT would collide with their body immediately.\n  - **Conclusion:** **Immediately deadly**.\n\n#### **4. Best Move: DOWN (4, 7)**\n- **Why?**\n  - **Safe:** No immediate collision with enemy or yourself.\n  - **Progressive:** Moves toward (7,7) in a straight line, minimizing risk of getting trapped.\n  - **Future flexibility:** After moving DOWN to (4,7), you can safely move DOWN again to (5,7) next turn, then (6,7), then (7,7).\n  - **Enemy\u2019s reaction:** If enemy moves UP to (5,3), they won\u2019t interfere with your path to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (4,6), your head at (4,7) is safe.\n\n#### **5. Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self)**\n- **Short-term (Turns 8-10):**\n  - Prioritize reaching (7,7) first (2 moves: DOWN \u2192 DOWN).\n  - Avoid moving LEFT unless enemy is clearly moving UP (which would block your path).\n  - Watch for enemy\u2019s body at (4,6) and avoid moving RIGHT or diagonally into it.\n- **Medium-term (Turns 11-15):**\n  - If (7,7) is eaten, focus on (5,8) or (8,6) (both are reachable in 3-4 moves).\n  - Monitor enemy\u2019s movement patterns\u2014if they\u2019re aggressive, avoid straight lines.\n  - If enemy grows (eats an apple), they may become more dangerous; adjust path accordingly.\n\n---\n**Final Move:** DOWN",

If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, your head would not collide with their body, but your body at (2,7) is still a hazard if they move RIGHT to (6,6) and your head moves to (3,6). This is a bit ambiguous, but the primary risk is Snake #0\u2019s head moving to (6,6) and your body at (2,7) being adjacent to their head at (6,6) if they move RIGHT.\n\n2. **LEFT (2,7):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves toward (5,8) or (8,6) in future turns. Avoids immediate collision with Snake #0\u2019s body if they move UP.\n   - **Risk:** If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,6), your body at (2,7) is adjacent to their new head at (6,6). This would be a collision if Snake #0 moves RIGHT, but your head is moving LEFT, so no immediate collision. However, your body at (2,7) is adjacent to Snake #0\u2019s head at (5,6) if they move UP to (5,3). This is a future hazard.\n   - **Outcome:** Safe if Snake #0 moves UP, but if they move RIGHT, your body at (2,7) is adjacent to their head at (6,6), which is a future hazard.\n\n3. **UP (3,8):**\n   - **Risk:** Collides with your own body (tail) at (2,7). Deadly.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,7):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves toward (7,7) without immediate collision with Snake #0\u2019s body if they move UP.\n   - **Risk:** If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,6), your head would not collide with their body, but your body at (2,7) is still a hazard if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,6). Additionally, your head moving RIGHT to (4,7) is adjacent to Snake #0\u2019s head at (5,6) if they move UP to (5,3). This is a future hazard.\n   - **Outcome:** Safe if Snake #0 moves UP, but if they move RIGHT, your head would not collide with their body, but your body at (2,7) is still a hazard.\n\n**Best Move: DOWN (3,6)**\n- **Rationale:** Moving DOWN is the safest immediate option. It keeps your head away from Snake #0\u2019s body if they move UP or RIGHT. Your body at (2,7) is not directly adjacent to Snake #0\u2019s head in this direction, and you are moving toward the closest apple (7,7) in a controlled manner.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self (Turns 10\u2013150):**\n1. **Prioritize (7,7):** Keep moving toward the closest apple (7,7) while avoiding Snake #0\u2019s potential expansions.\n2. **Monitor Snake #0\u2019s movements:** If Snake #0 moves UP to (5,3), their body at (4,6) becomes a hazard. Avoid moving RIGHT or diagonally into their new segments.\n3. **Avoid immediate collisions:** If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,6), ensure your head does not collide with their body. Your body should be positioned to avoid future hazards.\n4. **Expand toward multiple apples:** If Snake #0 is not a threat, consider moving toward other apples like (8,0), (5,8), or (8,6) to diversify your path.\n5. **Stay flexible:** Keep your body in a way that allows multiple safe follow-up moves. Avoid getting trapped in tight spaces.\n6. **Watch for Snake #0\u2019s growth:** If Snake #0 grows significantly, plan for their potential path expansions and avoid their body segments.\n7. **Long-term goal:** Aim to reach 30 apples by Turn 150. If Snake #0 reaches 30 or more, ensure you have a higher apple count to win.\n\nDOWN",

Moving UP to (4,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9,6)/(9,5), and your body is at (4,3). However, if Snake #0 moves LEFT to (8,6) next turn, it could collide with your head if you stay UP. Also, moving UP may not be the most direct path toward (7,7) or (5,8).\n\n2. **DOWN (6, 3):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8,6). Moving DOWN to (6,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9,6)/(9,5), and your body is at (4,3). This move is more direct toward (5,8) (distance: 1 down, 5 right). However, if Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9,7), it could block future expansion.\n\n3. **LEFT (5, 2):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8,6). Moving LEFT to (5,2) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9,6)/(9,5), and your body is at (4,3). This move is toward (5,0) (distance: 2 left, 9 up). However, it\u2019s a long-term strategy and may not be optimal for immediate apple collection.\n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 3):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (8,6). Moving RIGHT to (6,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9,6)/(9,5), and your body is at (4,3). This move is toward (7,7) (distance: 1 right, 4 up). It\u2019s the most direct path toward (7,7) and avoids immediate threats.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note:**\n- **Prioritize (7,7) and (5,8):** These are the most accessible apples. Moving RIGHT is the most efficient way to reach (7,7) while keeping Snake #0\u2019s head at bay.\n- **Avoid Snake #0\u2019s direct path:** If Snake #0 moves toward (8,6), avoid that cell in future turns. Currently, Snake #0\u2019s body is at (9,6)/(9,5), so it\u2019s unlikely to block your path to (7,7) directly.\n- **Expand toward (8,0) and (5,0):** These are distant but safer long-term targets if Snake #0 is aggressive. However, for now, focus on (7,7) and (5,8).\n- **Stay flexible:** If Snake #0 moves unpredictably, adjust your strategy to avoid tight corners and maintain a safe perimeter.\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**RIGHT**\n\nThis move maximizes your chances of reaching the closest apple (7,7) while keeping future options open and avoiding immediate threats.",

Moving UP to (6,2) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), and your body is at (5,3). However, this move is far from (7,7) and may not be optimal for immediate apple collection.\n\n2. **DOWN (7, 3):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (7,6). Moving DOWN to (7,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), and your body is at (5,3). This move is toward (7,7) (distance: 0 right, 4 up). However, Snake #0\u2019s head at (7,6) could block your path if it moves UP to (7,7) next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT (5, 3):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (7,6). Moving LEFT to (5,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), and your body is at (5,3). However, this move is backward into your own body (tail at (5,3)), which is a death move.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7, 3):**\n   - **Risk:** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (7,6). Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is safe because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), and your body is at (5,3). This move is toward (7,7) (distance: 0 right, 4 up). Snake #0\u2019s head at (7,6) could block your path if it moves UP to (7,7) next turn, but this is a safer immediate move than LEFT.\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note**\n- **Prioritize (7,7):** This is the closest apple, and moving RIGHT/DOWN to (7,3) is the most direct path.\n- **Avoid Snake #0\u2019s head at (7,6):** If Snake #0 moves UP to (7,7), you should avoid that cell in future turns. Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is safer than DOWN to (7,3) because Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), and it won\u2019t block your path.\n- **Expand toward (5,8) and (8,0):** These are distant but safer long-term targets if Snake #0 is aggressive. However, for now, focus on (7,7).\n- **Stay flexible:** If Snake #0 moves unpredictably, adjust your strategy to avoid tight corners and maintain a safe perimeter.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n**DOWN**\n\nThis move is the most direct path toward (7,7) while keeping Snake #0\u2019s head at bay. Snake #0\u2019s body is at (8,6)/(9,6), so moving DOWN to (7,3) is safe and maximizes your chances of reaching the apple.",

Moving DOWN to (7, 3) is safer than RIGHT in this scenario because Snake #0\u2019s head at (7, 6) could still block us if it moves UP, but the path is more straightforward toward the apple. The risk is manageable given the proximity of the apple.\n\n---\n**DOWN**",
