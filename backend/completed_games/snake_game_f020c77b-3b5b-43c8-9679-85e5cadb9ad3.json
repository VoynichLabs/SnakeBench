Immediate grab!\n- (2, 3) - far left\n- (1, 3) - far left  \n- (9, 3) - lower right corner area\n- (6, 3) - below and left\n\n**Enemy snake:** Head at (5, 9), no body. It's at the top row, to my upper-left.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (8, 8):**\n\n1. **UP (8, 9):** Safe, moves to top row. No apple there. Enemy is at (5, 9) so no head collision risk.\n\n2. **DOWN (8, 7):** Safe, no body there. Moves me away from the apple at (9, 8).\n\n3. **LEFT (7, 8):** This is where my body segment is! Would kill me. ELIMINATED.\n\n4. **RIGHT (9, 8):** Safe! This is where the apple is! I can grab it immediately!\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**\n- Enemy at (5, 9) could move: DOWN (5, 8), LEFT (4, 9), RIGHT (6, 9)\n- Cannot move UP (would go off board)\n- Enemy is far from me (3 cells away horizontally), no head collision risk this turn\n- Enemy might head toward the cluster of apples at (1, 3), (2, 3) on the left side\n\n**Collision risk analysis:**\n- RIGHT to (9, 8) is completely safe - no enemy threat, grabs an apple\n- No way enemy can reach (9, 8) this turn\n\n**Best move:** RIGHT to (9, 8)\n- Safe move\n- Immediately collects apple at (9, 8)!\n- Will grow to 5 segments\n- Score becomes 4 apples vs enemy's 0\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (9, 8) - collect apple!\n2. Next turn: Can go DOWN toward (9, 3) - another apple on the right side\n3. The right column (x=9) has apple at (9, 3), so I can go DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN to reach it\n4. After that, consider the apples on the left side (6, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3)\n5. With a 4-apple lead, I'm in a strong position - play somewhat safe while continuing to collect\n\nThis is an easy decision - grab that apple!\n\nRIGHT",

However, the enemy might also go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT to avoid collision or hunt other prey.\n\nActually, with a 5-0 lead and being longer, I should play aggressively. If we collide, I win. If enemy chickens out, I get the apple.\n\n**Strategic plan:**\n- Go LEFT to (6, 3) - either get apple or win by collision\n- Enemy has strong incentive to avoid collision since they'd lose\n- They might move away, letting me claim the apple\n\nLEFT",

Length 4 (collected the apple at (0, 6)).\n\nWait, looking at the board, the enemy head is AT (0, 6), which means they ate the apple there! Good for them but they're now longer.\n\n**Evaluating moves from (1, 1):**\n\n1. **UP (1, 2):** Safe! No obstacles there.\n\n2. **DOWN (1, 0):** This is where my body segment is! Would kill me. ELIMINATED.\n\n3. **LEFT (0, 1):** Safe - empty space.\n\n4. **RIGHT (2, 1):** Safe - empty space.\n\n**Safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT**\n\n**Comparing options:**\n\n**LEFT to (0, 1):**\n- Moves me toward the left column\n- Enemy is at (0, 6), so they're on the same column but far away\n- From (0, 1): can go UP (0, 2), or RIGHT (back to where I was)\n- Limited future options near the wall\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 1):**\n- Opens up toward the middle of the board\n- But moves away from the apple cluster at (2, 8), (2, 9)\n- Good for safety but not optimal for apple collection\n\n**UP to (1, 2):**\n- Moves me toward the apple cluster at (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7)\n- From (1, 2): can go UP (1, 3), LEFT (0, 2), or RIGHT (2, 2)\n- Multiple options available\n- Direct path toward apples\n\n**Enemy movement analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (0, 6) with body at (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)\n- Enemy can move: UP (0, 7), RIGHT (1, 6)\n- DOWN would hit their body at (0, 5)\n- LEFT would be off board\n- They're likely heading UP toward apples at (2, 8), (2, 9) or (3, 7)\n\n**Strategic decision:**\n\nUP to (1, 2) is the best choice:\n- Moves toward the apple cluster\n- Multiple escape routes available\n- My body will start clearing behind me\n- I'm winning 8-3, so I should keep collecting apples while staying safe\n\n**Path planning:**\n- Turn 26: UP to (1, 2)\n- Turn 27: Continue UP or navigate toward (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7)\n- Plan: Go UP the left side (avoiding enemy), collect apples at (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7)\n- Be cautious of enemy who might also be heading toward the same apple cluster\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nKeep heading UP toward the apple cluster. My tail will clear from the bottom, giving me more room. Watch the enemy's position - they're on (0, 6) and might interfere with my path to (2, 8) and (2, 9). Consider going slightly right to (3, 7) or (4, 9) if enemy blocks the left path.\n\nUP",
