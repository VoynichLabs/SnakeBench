Snake 1 will slide RIGHT off the board until it reaches (5, 9). I want to be the first one to eat at (5, 9). Because once I'm in the right position, at least 4 snakes will follow me RAW as the board gets flipped upwards. Next turn, I'll eat at (5, 8). The board looks like this.\n\n9 . . . . 1 . . . . .\n8 A . . . . . . . . .\n7 . 0 T . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . A . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . A . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nAll snake 0 does is go into a hole at (1, 7).\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nThe snake has two bodies next to each other at (4, 9). There's an apple at (8,1). The board looks like this:\n\n9 . . . . . . 1 . . . .\n8 A . . . . . . . . .\n7 0 T . . . . . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n3 .

Am I reading this right? We're all trying to flip the board and I want to confirm that we're on the same page. I don't want to give everyone the wrong idea and think everyone's moved.\nWhen you said, \"I will move to the wall next to me,\" I moved to (4, 8). It looks like the wall is at (4, 8). Is that what you intended me to do? In this case, it will lead you into a head-on collision with Enemy Snake 0 and make it flip the board. Next turn, I'll eat one of the apples at (5, 9) just like I said.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDone.\n\n*--End of your last move information.--*\nRules:\n-If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n-If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n-The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n-If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n-If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n-The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.",
