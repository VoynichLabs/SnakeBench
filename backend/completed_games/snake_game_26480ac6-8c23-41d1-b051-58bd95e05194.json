Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), with body at (0, 9). Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

Wait, this seems off; the initial info suggests the head is at (0, 7), but the last move analyzed was \"DOWN\" from (7, 9). I need to clarify which position is accurate.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\n- My snake's head is at (7, 9), but the position labels show 9 at the top, with (0,0) at bottom left. The display shows the snake at (0,7), but the last move was \"DOWN,\" which would move from (7,9) to (7,8). So the initial mention of head at (0,7) seems inconsistent.\n\nFrom the \"Board state\" snippet:\n\n- At row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" at top\n- The snake character \"1\" (my snake) is at row 7, column 0 (bottom left is (0,0)), and the head is at (0,7).\n\nBut in the \"Your snake\" description: head at (0,7), body at [(0,8)].\n\nSo, the snake's head at (0,7), body at (0,8). The move \"DOWN\" from (0,7) leads to (0,6). But the last move was \"DOWN,\" which indicates moving from (0,7) to (0,6)? But in the previous message, the move was from (7,9) to (7,8).\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to trust the initial details:\n\n- Head at (0,7)\n- Body at [(0,8)]\n- Last move: DOWN\n\nMoving from (0,7) down to (0,6):\n\n- (0,6) is safe, no obstacle.\n- But, we know the apples are at various positions.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (1,3), (1,6), (7,8), (7,5), (2,1)\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly above (1,3). The apple at (7,8) is to the right and up.\n\nGiven that, and considering we're at (0,7):\n\n- Moving right to (1,7) would be close to apples at (1,6), which is only one cell below, or (1,3), which is outside the immediate area.\n\n- Moving up from (0,7) would be to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell (0,8) is occupied by the body, so moving up would cause collision if the body is there.\n\n- Moving left to (-1,7) would go outside the board, invalid.\n\n- Moving down to (0,6):\n\n  - If no obstacle, safe.\n\nSince the last move was \"DOWN,\" and moving from (0,7) to (0,6) is safe, and aligns with the prior move, and no apples at (0,6). But we see apples at (1,6) and (2,1), which are not immediately accessible.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit, I want to eat the apple at (1,6). To do that:\n\n- From (0,7), moving right to (1,7) is the adjacent cell.\n\n- The apple is at (1,6), one space below.\n\n- Moving down from (0,7) to (0,6) would be away from the apple.\n\nTherefore, to reach the apple at (1,6), better to move right from (0,7) to (1,7), then down to (1,6).\n\nBut, the move just made was \"DOWN\" from (0,7); perhaps I should plan my move accordingly.\n\nGiven this, perhaps moving right (to (1,7)) is more advantageous to pursue the apple at (1,6).\n\nMoreover, check for hazards:\n\n- Moving right to (1,7): cell is free.\n\n- Moving down from (1,7) to (1,6): cell contains an apple.\n\nThis suggests a two-turn plan:\n\n- Next move: RIGHT (to (1,7)), then after consuming apple at (1,6), move down to (1,6).\n\nBut in one move, I cannot go two steps. So, for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better as it positions me closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nOr, alternatively, moving down (from (0,7) to (0,6)) is safe and might allow direct access to a different apple if paths are considered.\n\nIn addition, the current position at (0,7):\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,7):\n\n  - Cell is empty.\n\n- Moving UP to (0,8):\n\n  - Cell occupied by body at (0,8), so unsafe.\n\n- Moving DOWN to (0,6):\n\n  - Safe.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (-1,7):\n\n  - Out of bounds, invalid.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT to (1,7) seems the best move to get closer to the apple at (1,6) and to grow.\n\nLikewise, moving RIGHT from (0,7) to (1,7), then further down to (1,6), would be a good plan.\n\nSince I can only choose one move now, I should pick the move that advances me toward known apple locations.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move:\n\n- **Next move: RIGHT**\n\nThis will position me closer to the apple at (1,6) and is safe.\n\nNext, I can plan to move down to eat the apple.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision: RIGHT**",

No obstacle there, and not near an apple; but it could be a safe move if there's no immediate threat.\n\n- Moving up: to (2,8). Is there any obstacle there? No known obstacle, but at (2,8), which is not directly indicated as dangerous.\n\n- Moving down: to (2,6). No obstacle there.\n\nIf I want to go toward the apple at (1,6), moving left is the obvious choice, but it's blocked by my own body at (1,7), which is unsafe.\n\nNext, perhaps moving down to (2,6) is safe; from there, I could move left toward (1,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (3,7) may be a safe way to explore.\n\nGiven the proximity of the apple at (1,6), and that moving left is blocked, the safest immediate move is to go DOWN to (2,6).\n\nNext turn, I can attempt to move left to (1,6) to eat the apple.\n\nSo, the best immediate move is DOWN.\n\nNext move plan: move down to position (2,6), then plan to go left to eat (1,6).\n\n**Next move: DOWN**",
