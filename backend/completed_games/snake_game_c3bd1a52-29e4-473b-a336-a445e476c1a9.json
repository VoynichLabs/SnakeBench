Since Snake #2 has no body length, it's likely that it just started the game, and I should be cautious not to collide with it.\n\nGiven my current position at (3, 3), moving up seems to be a viable option, as it would bring me closer to the apple at (2, 8) and potentially allow me to grow. However, I should also consider moving right to get closer to the apple at (5, 2).\n\nFor now, my strategy will be to prioritize moving towards the closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position. \n\nNext turn, I'll remind myself to continue monitoring the enemy snake's movements and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nMy decided next move: UP"
