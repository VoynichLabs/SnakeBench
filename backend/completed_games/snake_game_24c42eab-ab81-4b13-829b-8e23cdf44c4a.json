We're at (0,6) and we need to move AGGRESSIVELY. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1. **Assessing the Board:**\n   - We are at **(0,6)**.\n   - Enemy is at **(4,1)**.\n   - Apples are scattered. The closest one to us is likely **(1,5)** (distance 2) or **(5,8)** (distance 7).\n   - The enemy is closer to **(1,5)** than we are (distance ~4.5 vs our ~2.4) but they have to traverse through the board while we are on the edge.\n\n2. **Eliminating Moves (DEATH ZONE):**\n   - **UP:** (0,7) -> Safe empty space.\n   - **DOWN:** (0,5) -> Safe empty space.\n   - **LEFT:** (-1,6) -> **DEATH** (Off board). Eliminated.\n   - **RIGHT:** (1,6) -> Safe empty space.\n\n3. **Strategic Analysis:**\n   - **GOAL:** Box in the enemy.\n   - **Current Threat:** The enemy is far away (center-left). We are on the far left edge.\n   - **Apple Contention:** Apple at (1,5) is very close to both of us. If I go DOWN to (0,5), I am close to (1,5) but I'm giving up the center. If I go RIGHT to (1,6), I secure a spot closer to (1,5) and (5,8).\n   - **Trapping Potential:** By moving **RIGHT**, I move away from the wall and into the board. This gives me more maneuvering room. If I stay on the edge (Up or Down), I risk getting boxed in by the enemy later if he pushes me against the wall.\n   - **Aggression:** The enemy is at (4,1). They likely want to go up or right toward the apples in the top right or center. By moving **RIGHT**, I intercept the center-left area.\n\n4. **The Play:**\n   - **RIGHT** to (1,6).\n   - Why? It opens up paths to multiple apples: (1,5) is now adjacent, (5,8) is reachable, and (6,6) is reachable.\n   - It forces the enemy to deal with my presence in the center rather than me being a passive edge camper.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the center-left quadrant. Force the enemy into the top-right corner where the density of apples is higher, but the space is more crowded for them. I need to cut off their access to the left side.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nI'm moving into the fray. Let's see what he does.\n\nRIGHT",

This is the opening move \u2014 gotta set the tone! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nMy head at (4,1). Enemy head at (0,6). Apples scattered everywhere but we ignore apples for now? Nah, we can glance \u2014 closest apple to me is (4,3) up two, or (1,1) left three down zero? Wait (1,1) is left 3, down 0 from me? Actually from (4,1) to (1,1) is left 3, same y. But enemy is far away top-left.\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\nUP \u2192 (4,2) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \nDOWN \u2192 (4,0) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (3,1) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5,1) \u2014 empty, in bounds \u2705  \n\nAll safe. No bodies anywhere.\n\nNow, think about enemy movement. Enemy at (0,6) can go UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), RIGHT to (1,6), LEFT is out of bounds (dead). So they probably won't go left. They might go for apple at (1,5) down-left from them? That's (1,5) from (0,6) is RIGHT + DOWN. Hmm.\n\nBut long-term: I want to control center, cut off enemy expansion. If I go UP to (4,2), I'm closer to center y-level and closer to apple at (4,3). Also from (4,2) my next moves still open. If I go RIGHT to (5,1), I'm near apple at (5,0) down, but that's edge. LEFT to (3,1) is okay but not progress. DOWN to (4,0) is bottom row \u2014 limiting.\n\nBest aggressive but safe? UP. Gets me toward middle, more options next turn. Enemy far away, no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nPLAN FOR NEXT TURNS: Move toward center, try to get between enemy and the bulk of apples. Watch enemy's possible path toward apples at (1,5),(3,6),(4,6). If I can cut off his access by occupying key cells, we can trap him later. Grow early to have longer body to block with.\n\nUP",

Right in the thick of it now.\n- **Enemy Location:** (4,2) \u2014 Still chilling in the lower-center.\n- **Score:** 0-0. Even Steven. Time to make a move that counts.\n\n**ANALYZING THE GRID (10x10):**\nFrom my spot at (1,6), I'm surrounded by potential. But I need to watch my step because that Enemy Snake #1 is lurking nearby. If I move wrong, I could meet him head-on and that's a GG for both of us.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP \u2192 (1,7):** Empty space. Safe.\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (1,5):** Contains an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e If I eat this, I grow to length 2 and get +1 score. However, looking at the board, Snake #1 is at (4,2). He's two moves away from this apple (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5). Wait, he's further than I thought. He can't get there this turn. Eating this apple is SAFE.\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (0,6):** Empty space. Safe.\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (2,6):** Empty space. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **Goal:** Dominate the board. Growth is key, but so is positioning.\n- **Apple Contention:** (1,5) is free for the taking. If I don't eat it, I'm letting potential growth slip away. Plus, it puts me closer to (1,2) or (0,5) etc.\n- **Enemy Threats:** The enemy is at (4,2). He has apples at (5,0), (4,3), (3,4), (1,2), (6,2). He might move toward the center-left. If I go DOWN to (1,5), I block his path upward to the center cluster.\n- **Board Control:** By taking the apple at (1,5), I effectively claim the left-center area. I'll grow, which gives me more reach (literally, a longer tail next turn).\n- **Risk Assessment:**\n    - If I go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT, I miss the apple. That's weak play. We want points.\n    - If I go DOWN to (1,5), I get a point. The enemy is too far to contest it. The only danger is if he moves into a spot that hits my *tail* next turn, but since I'm just a head and a tail now, and he's at (4,2), that's highly unlikely.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm taking the **DOWN** move. Secure the point. Grow the snake. Establish presence near the bottom-left cluster of apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGobble up the apples on the left side ((1,5), (1,2), (0,5)) to build size. Once I'm big enough, I can wall off the left side and force the enemy into the tighter top-right corners.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1. Eliminate off-board moves (None here, I'm central-ish).\n2. Eliminate moves into my own body (None, I'm just a head and a tail).\n3. Eliminate moves into enemy body (Enemy is far at (4,2)).\n4. Among safe moves, pick the one that yields the highest immediate reward (Apple at 1,5) and doesn't trap me.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nI'm hungry. Let's eat. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

No risk of collision this turn since enemy is far.\n\nBut we gotta think AGGRESSIVELY! \ud83d\udc0d Enemy is at (1,6). They can go: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5) \u2014 apple there!, RIGHT (2,6), LEFT (0,6). They'll probably go for that apple at (1,5) DOWN. If they do, they grow next turn.\n\nWe need to start cutting off their space and growing ourselves. Look at apples near us: (4,3) UP one, (3,4) UP-LEFT, (4,6) far up, (6,2) RIGHT two. Also (1,2) far left but that's closer to enemy maybe?\n\nIf we go UP to (4,3), we eat apple immediately, grow to length 2. That's CONTENT! \ud83d\ude0e And it puts us closer to center control. From (4,3) next turn, we have options. Downside? If enemy goes for (1,5) and grows, they'll be same length as us (both length 2). But we'll have more body to block later.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,2), we're moving toward center-left but no apple. RIGHT to (5,2) moves toward apple at (6,2) but not eating yet. DOWN to (4,1) is backtracking, less aggressive.\n\nBEST MOVE: UP to eat apple, grow early, gain score advantage. With higher score, if we force head-on collision later, WE WIN. Also, eating apple at (4,3) might deny enemy pathing through middle later.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After eating, aim to control vertical column around x=4, expand toward enemy's side (left side) to limit their expansion. Watch enemy's likely path toward apples at (3,6),(4,6). If we grow faster, we can wall them off.\n\nUP",

We ate the apple last turn, so we are growing! Our body is now at (1,5) (old head) and (1,6) (old body). Wait, looking at the board state, our head is (1,5) and body is [(1,6)]. That means last turn we moved DOWN to (1,5), eating the apple. Correct. Now we are length 2.\n\n**THE SCOUTING REPORT:**\n*   **My Location:** (1,5) - Head. Body at (1,6).\n*   **Enemy Location:** (4,3) - He moved UP. He is hunting. He has apples nearby at (3,4) and (4,6) maybe? Actually (4,6) is an apple? No, the list shows (4,6) is an apple? Let me check. Board shows A at (4,6)? No, board state shows (4,6) is empty? Wait, the apple list has (4,6). Board state shows (4,6) is empty? Let me look at the board state again.\n    Board:\n    Row 6: `. T . A A . A . . .` -> (3,6) is A, (4,6) is A? No, (4,6) is A. (6,6) is A.\n    Row 5: `. 0 . . . . A . . .` -> (6,5) is A.\n    Row 4: `. . . A . . . A . .` -> (3,4) is A, (7,4) is A.\n    Row 3: `. . . . 1 . . . . .` -> (4,3) is Enemy.\n    Row 2: `. A . . T . A . . .` -> (1,2) is A? No (1,2) is A? Wait (1,2) is empty? (1,2) is empty? (1,2) is A in the list. Board shows `. A . . T` at row 2. (1,2) is A? Yes (1,2) is an apple. (4,2) is T (Tail).\n    \n    Apples near me: (1,5) gone (ate it). (1,2) is below me. (3,6) is to the right/up. (6,5) is far right.\n    Apples near enemy: (3,4) is close to him (4,3). (1,2) is closer to me (distance 3) than him (distance 5? 4,3->3,3->2,3->1,3->1,2 = 4 moves). I am at 1,5. 1,5->1,4->1,3->1,2 = 3 moves. I am faster.\n    (3,4) is 3,4. Enemy at 4,3. Distance 2. He can eat it next turn if I don't interfere.\n\n**ANALYZING THE GRID:**\nI need to grow. I have an apple at (1,2) which is DOWN. I have (3,6) which is RIGHT and UP.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4):\n*   I am safe? (1,4) is empty.\n*   Next turn I can go to (1,3) then (1,2).\n*   Enemy is at (4,3). He might go for (3,4). If he goes to (3,4), he grows. That gives him length 2 (he was 1, plus body). I am currently length 2 (head + body). If I eat (1,2) next turn, I become length 3.\n*   If I go RIGHT to (2,5): Safe. (2,5) is empty. But I am moving away from the easy apple (1,2). I am moving toward (3,6).\n*   If I go UP to (1,6): **DEATH**. My body is at (1,6). I would hit myself.\n*   If I go LEFT to (0,5): Safe. But isolated. Bad idea.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n*   **Apple Contention:** (1,2) is the play. It's close and safe. Enemy is distracted by (3,4).\n*   **Enemy Threats:** Enemy is at (4,3). He wants (3,4). If I go DOWN, I am not in his way. If I go RIGHT, I might get closer to the center fight, but I leave the apple behind.\n*   **Board Control:** Dominating the left side is key. Securing (1,2) sets up a chain down the left edge.\n*   **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   **UP:** Hits my body (1,6). **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT:** Safe but leads to a dead end eventually (0,5).\n    *   **RIGHT:** Safe. (2,5) is open. But I lose momentum on (1,2).\n    *   **DOWN:** Safe. (1,4) is empty. Moves me closer to (1,2). Keeps me in a safe corridor.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am going **DOWN**. I need that apple at (1,2). I need to grow to match or exceed the enemy's potential growth. He might eat (3,4) this turn. I need to eat (1,2) in 2 turns.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (1,2). Then maybe sweep right towards (3,6) or (6,5) depending on enemy position. Keep him pinned on the right side.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **UP:** Hits own body (1,6). **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **LEFT:** Safe but cornering. **LOW PRIORITY.**\n3.  **RIGHT:** Safe, but misses the immediate apple target. **GOOD BUT SECONDARY.**\n4.  **DOWN:** Safe, moves towards (1,2), keeps path open. **BEST.**\n\nI am safe. I am growing. Let's go.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We have UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, enemy at (1,5) can move: UP (1,6) \u2013 that's their own body, so unlikely unless they're throwing. DOWN (1,4) \u2013 empty. LEFT (0,5) \u2013 empty. RIGHT (2,5) \u2013 empty.\n\nThey might go for the apple at (3,4) by moving RIGHT then DOWN next turn, or go DOWN toward (1,2) apple later.\n\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc0d We have higher score? NO, tied. But we want to grow and control.\n\n**UP to (4,4)** \u2013 Puts us closer to apples at (4,6) and (3,6). Opens future options UP/LEFT/RIGHT. Safe.\n\n**LEFT to (3,3)** \u2013 Moves toward center-left, closer to apple at (3,4) next turn. But enemy might also aim there.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,3)** \u2013 Moves toward apples at (6,2) or (6,5). Slightly away from enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to **cut off enemy's expansion** toward the right side (apples at (4,6), (6,6), etc.). If we go UP, we start building a vertical wall near x=4. Enemy is on left side (x=1). If we control the center, we can slowly squeeze them.\n\nAlso, think about **head-on collision risk** this turn: Could enemy move to (4,4) same time we do? No, they're too far. Could they move to (3,3)? No. So all safe.\n\nBest move? **UP** \u2013 gains territory toward top-center apples, keeps options open, avoids backtracking into our body.\n\nChat, we're going UP to dominate the board!

We\u2019re LIVE on Turn 3 and the stakes are rising! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc0d The score is tied 1-1, and that enemy snake is sitting at (4,4) right now, eyeing that apple at (3,4) like it\u2019s free real estate. But I\u2019m not letting him take the lead without a fight! Let\u2019s break this down.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (1,4) | **Body:** [(1,5)] | **Apples:** 1\n- **Enemy Head:** (4,4) | **Body:** [(4,3)] | **Apples:** 1\n- **Board State:** It\u2019s a 10x10 grid. I\u2019m on the left side, enemy is central. Apples are scattered, but the closest ones to me are (1,2) DOWN and (3,6) RIGHT/UP.\n- **Critical Move:** My last move was DOWN, so I\u2019m now at (1,4). I cannot move UP because that would crash into my own body at (1,5). **DEATH TRAP!**\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1. **UP:** Hits my body (1,5). **ELIMINATED** \u2013 instant death, no questions asked.\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (1,3). This is safe (empty) and brings me closer to the apple at (1,2). It also keeps me in a corridor where I can pivot later.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (0,4). This is safe (empty) but pushes me into the corner. That\u2019s a dead end in the long run \u2013 bad news for board control.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (2,4). This is safe (empty) and moves toward the center, but it abandons the easy apple at (1,2). The enemy is eyeing (3,4), so going right might put me in his path.\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **Apple Contention:** (1,2) is a low-hanging fruit. Enemy is too far to contest it if I head down now. If I go DOWN to (1,3), I can eat (1,2) next turn. Meanwhile, the enemy will likely go for (3,4) \u2013 good for him, but I\u2019ll grow faster.\n- **Enemy Threats:** The enemy is at (4,4). If he moves LEFT to (3,4), he eats an apple and grows. If he moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, he\u2019s chasing apples elsewhere. I need to avoid head-on collisions. My DOWN move keeps me away from him for now.\n- **Board Control:** Dominating the left edge is key. Securing (1,2) opens up a path to the bottom-left corner, which I can sweep later. Going RIGHT or LEFT traps me early.\n- **Risk Assessment:** \n  - DOWN is safe and growth-oriented. \n  - RIGHT is safe but delays my apple gain. \n  - LEFT is a corner trap. \n  - UP is suicide.\n\n**THE PLAY:** \nI\u2019m going **DOWN** to (1,3). Why? \n- It\u2019s safe. \n- It positions me to eat (1,2) next turn, growing to length 3 and taking the lead. \n- It avoids the enemy\u2019s immediate vicinity. \n- It keeps my options open for future moves (I can pivot right or down later).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (1,2) next turn. Then, assess the board: If the enemy is distracted by (3,4), I\u2019ll sweep toward (3,6) or (6,5) to secure more apples. If he tries to cut me off, I\u2019ll use my length to box him in. Remember, chat: aggression wins games. But first, I need to grow!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN \u2013 because I\u2019m here to eat apples and dominate, not to crash and burn! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Enemy is on left column x=1. If we move LEFT to (3,4), we're moving toward them, cutting off their expansion to the right.

If we go LEFT to (3,4), next turn we could go UP to (3,5) or LEFT to (2,4) to block their rightward moves. They'll be stuck near left edge with fewer apples.\n\nAlso, apple at (3,4) is RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udf4e If we go LEFT, we land on it, GROW to length 3, and get score advantage! That means if we force a head-on collision later while longer, WE WIN! \ud83d\ude08\n\nCheck: moving LEFT to (3,4) \u2014 apple present? YES! (3,4) is an apple! Let's eat it and get bigger!\n\nUP and RIGHT don't get an apple this turn. So LEFT gives immediate growth + score lead + positional pressure.\n\nChat, this is the play! We go LEFT, eat the apple, become longer, and start cutting off the enemy's space! We'll be at (3,4) length 3, they're at length 2. Next turn we can threaten head-on if they come close!\n\nLEFT",

We're length 3, score 2 vs enemy score 1. We have the lead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nOur body: [(4,4), (4,3)]  \nEnemy head: **(1,3)**, body: [(1,4)]\n\nCheck our moves from (3,4):\n\n**UP \u2192 (3,5)** \u2013 Empty \u2705  \n**DOWN \u2192 (3,3)** \u2013 Empty \u2705  \n**LEFT \u2192 (2,4)** \u2013 Empty \u2705  \n**RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)** \u2013 That's our own body! \u274c SELF-CRASH! So RIGHT is out.\n\nAll moves except RIGHT are safe from immediate self-crash and in bounds.\n\nNow, enemy at (1,3) can move:  \nUP (1,4) \u2013 their own body \u274c  \nDOWN (1,2) \u2013 empty \u2705 (apple at (1,2)!)  \nLEFT (0,3) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nRIGHT (2,3) \u2013 empty \u2705\n\nThey will likely go DOWN for the apple at (1,2) to tie the score. Or maybe RIGHT toward center.\n\nHead-on collision risk THIS TURN?  \nIf we go LEFT to (2,4), enemy going RIGHT to (2,3)? No, different y.  \nIf we go UP to (3,5), enemy can't reach.  \nIf we go DOWN to (3,3), enemy going RIGHT to (2,3)? Still no collision.  \nSo all safe from immediate head-on.\n\nBut we're AGGRESSIVE!

We're building a WALL! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nUP goes toward apples at (3,6), (4,6), (4,8) \u2014 growth.  \nDOWN goes toward apple at (1,1), (1,2) \u2014 but that's where enemy might go! Risk sharing apples? Nah, we want to PRESSURE!\n\nLong-term plan: **Squeeze them against the left wall!** Move left to dominate the center-left, cut off their rightward expansion, and force them into a corner or a bad collision. With our length lead, we can afford to be aggressive and control space.\n\nLEFT feels like the power move! We advance our position, maintain multiple safe options next turn (from (2,4) we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT), and keep the pressure!\n\nChat, we're going in for the KILL! LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 4, and we're still in this! The score is 1-2, so I'm trailing but not out. We gotta be sharp and aggressive. Let's break down the board state and map out the kill move.\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 3) | **Body:** [(1, 4)] | **Apples:** 1 (Down from (1,4) last turn. Good.)\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 4) | **Body:** [(4, 4), (4, 3)] | **Apples:** 2\n- **Board State:** I'm at (1,3), enemy is at (3,4). That's a direct line. We're close, chat.\n- **Critical Move:** My last move was DOWN from (1,4) to (1,3). So moving UP back to (1,4) would be moving into my own body (my tail/old body segment). That's death. **DEATH TRAP!**\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (ELIMINATE THE BAD):**\n\n1.  **UP:** Moves to (1,4). This is my own body. **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** I'm cooked. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (1,2). This is safe (empty) and actually an apple location `(1, 2)`. I'd grow to length 3. Solid move, but it moves away from the enemy.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (0,3). This is on the wall, safe. But it's a corner play. Limits my future moves.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (2,3). This is safe (empty). It moves me towards the center and towards the enemy's position at (3,4).\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n- **The Trap Setup:** The enemy is at (3,4). He wants apples like `(3, 6)` or maybe `(4,6)`. If I can cut him off or force a collision, I win because I have the lower score? NO! Wait. **THE RULES:** \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" I have 1, he has 2. I have the *lower* score. If we collide, I die and he lives. I need to avoid head-on collisions unless I'm winning.\n- **BUT:** If he moves into my body, *he* dies. That's the plan. I need to position myself so his possible moves into me result in his death.\n- **Apple Analysis:** `(1, 2)` is right there. Eating it grows me to length 3. But if I take it, I'm at (1,2). The enemy at (3,4) isn't threatening me directly yet.\n- **Aggression vs. Survival:** I need to close the distance to threaten him, but I can't crash. The board is open.\n- **Look at Enemy Moves:** He is at (3,4). Where can he go?\n    - UP to (3,5) - safe\n    - DOWN to (3,3) - safe\n    - LEFT to (2,4) - safe\n    - RIGHT to (4,4) - **CRASH!** (4,4) is his own body. If he moves RIGHT, he dies.\n    - If I move RIGHT to (2,3), I am adjacent to his potential path. If he moves DOWN to (3,3), I am at (2,3). Not a collision. If he moves LEFT to (2,4), I am at (2,3). Not a collision.\n\n**The Play:**\nIf I move **RIGHT to (2,3)**:\n- I am safe.\n- I move toward the center.\n- I am close to the enemy.\n- I keep options open.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (1,2)**:\n- I eat an apple (Growth! Content!).\n- I move away from the fight.\n- I am at (1,2). The enemy is at (3,4). Distance is increasing.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nEnemy: (3,4).\nMe: (1,3).\nApple at (1,2) is DOWN.\nApple at (2,5) is not there.\nApple at (3,6) is UP/RIGHT from enemy.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I am setting up to potentially head him off. If he goes LEFT to (2,4), we are side by side. If he goes DOWN to (3,3), we are diagonal. If he goes UP to (3,5), we are diagonal.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,2), I secure an apple. That grows me to length 3. I am safe. But am I being too passive? The chat wants aggression!\n\nLet's look at the `APPLE DROPS` list again.\n(1, 2) is an apple. It is literally below me.\nIf I take it, I get +1 length.\nIf I don't take it, the enemy is too far to get it this turn.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (1,2) to grow. Once length 3, I have more body to work with to box him in. If I stay at length 2, I'm small and agile, but growing is necessary to win the score game.\n\n**Why not RIGHT?**\nRight moves me to (2,3). The apple at (1,2) is still there. I'm not eating anything. I'm just moving. In a race to 30 apples, every apple counts. Taking the free apple is smart.\nAlso, by going DOWN, I am at (1,2). My body will be [(1,3), (1,4)].\nThe enemy is at (3,4).\nNext turn, I can turn RIGHT towards (2,2) or (2,1) or stay near the edge.\nOr, if the enemy rushes me, my body blocks the path.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe enemy is at (3,4). He has a body at (4,4) and (4,3).\nIf I go DOWN to (1,2), I am securing a point. I am not exposing myself to immediate collision.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I am entering the \"danger zone\" without growing.\nGrowth is power. I need to close the score gap (1 vs 2).\n\nI will take the apple at (1,2).\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head (1,1), body [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)], score 3 apples. He's longer, so head-on collision would kill us if we meet heads! Gotta avoid that for now.\n\n**POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (2,5):**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,6)** \u2013 Check: Inside board? Yes. Our body? No. Enemy body? No enemy there. Safe? \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,4)** \u2013 Check: That's our own neck! That's moving backwards into our body segment. INSTANT DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATE!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,5)** \u2013 Check: Inside board? Yes. Our body? No. Enemy body? No enemy there. Safe? \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,5)** \u2013 Check: Inside board? Yes. Our body? No. Enemy body? No enemy there. Safe? \u2705\n\nAll three UP, LEFT, RIGHT seem immediately safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (1,1). He can move UP (1,2) \u2013 that's his own body segment, so he probably won't (suicide). DOWN (1,0) \u2013 safe. LEFT (0,1) \u2013 safe. RIGHT (2,1) \u2013 safe. He'll likely avoid UP. He might go for apple at (1,9)? Too far. He might try to cut us off or grow.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to **BOX HIM IN** while we grow! He's longer, so we can't face him head-on yet. Let's maneuver to get above him or trap him against a wall. The board has apples top-left and top-right. We should move towards open space and maybe grab an apple to close the score gap.\n\n**RIGHT NOW:** \n- **UP (2,6)** \u2013 Puts us closer to apples at (3,6), (4,6), (6,6) etc. Good growth path. Keeps distance from enemy.\n- **LEFT (1,5)** \u2013 Moves us closer to left wall, might limit options. But could go up later towards apples.\n- **RIGHT (3,5)** \u2013 Moves us toward center, more options.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** Could enemy move into our target cell simultaneously? If we go LEFT to (1,5), enemy could go RIGHT to (2,1) \u2013 no conflict. If we go RIGHT to (3,5), enemy would need to go to (3,1) \u2013 not possible. If we go UP to (2,6), enemy can't reach. So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**DECISION:** Let's take **UP** to gain height, move toward apple cluster, and keep our distance from the longer snake. We'll reassess next turn!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\n\nUP",

Let's break it down:\n- **UP to (1, 1):** \u274c **DEATH.** That's my own body\u2014straight into myself, game over.\n- **LEFT to (0, 0):** \u274c **DEATH.** Off the board\u2014wall hit, I'm done.\n- **DOWN to (1, -1):** \u274c **DEATH.** Off the board\u2014negative y, not allowed.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 0):** \u2705 **SAFE.** Open space, no snakes, no apple. Moves me right along the bottom edge.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWith my length (4 segments) vs their length (3), I'm winning on the scoreboard.

From (2, 0), I can pivot UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (if I wrap around mentally) next turn, keeping options open. No head-on collision risk here\u2014enemy is way up at (2, 6). Stay aggressive, but stay alive!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nHold the bottom edge. If the enemy paths down toward apples like (6, 0) or (4, 0), I'll cut them off. Keep growing if apples appear, but prioritize boxing them in. We're aiming for the win by outlasting and dominating space.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at (1,0), body [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], score 3 apples. He's longer by 1 segment! Head-on collision would kill us right now, so we must avoid meeting heads.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (2,6):**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,7)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. Safe.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,5)** \u2013 That's our own neck! Moving backwards into our body segment \u274c INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATE!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,6)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. Safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all immediately safe.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (1,0). He can move:\n- UP to (1,1) \u2013 That's his own body! \u274c Suicide, unlikely.\n- DOWN to (1,-1) \u2013 Off board! \u274c Death, unlikely.\n- LEFT to (0,0) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (2,0) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n\nHe'll probably avoid UP and DOWN. So likely LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0). Could he go for the apple at (5,0)? Maybe, but he's far.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go LEFT to (1,6), enemy would need to go to (1,6) too \u2014 impossible from (1,0). If we go RIGHT to (3,6), enemy can't reach. If we go UP to (2,7), enemy can't reach. So NO risk of head-on collision this turn. Good.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We're shorter, so we need to grow while boxing him in! He's trapped near the bottom-left corner with his long body along y=1,2,3. We're above him. If we move UP or RIGHT, we head toward apple clusters at (3,6), (4,6), (6,6), (6,8) etc. That's growth! We want to get longer FAST so we can challenge him head-on. Also, we could try to trap him against the left wall by controlling the space above him.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP (2,7):** Puts us closer to apples, keeps central y-axis, opens future moves in all directions except back down. Good for growth.\n- **LEFT (1,6):** Moves us closer to left wall, limits future rightward options. But could go up next turn toward apples at (1,9) maybe. Riskier space.\n- **RIGHT (3,6):** Moves us toward center and apple at (3,6) directly! That's an apple next turn if we go RIGHT now? Wait, apple at (3,6) is on the board! Yes, look at board: (3,6) has 'A'. So RIGHT puts us adjacent to an apple we can eat next turn! That's HUGE for closing the score gap! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**APPLE FOCUS:** Right now, apples at (3,6), (4,6), (6,6) are nearby. Going RIGHT to (3,5)? No, we're at (2,6). RIGHT is (3,6) \u2014 THAT'S AN APPLE CELL! OH SNAP! That means if we move RIGHT, we land on (3,6) and EAT AN APPLE THIS TURN, growing to length 4! Enemy would still be length 4 (he has 3 apples, so 3+1=4 segments? Wait, he has 3 apples, so length = 3+1=4? Actually, starting length is 3? Let's check: his body is [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] \u2014 that's 4 segments! Yes, he has 3 apples, so length 4. We have 2 apples, length 3. If we eat this apple, we become length 4, TIED with him! Then head-on collision would be a tie \u2014 both die, but he has more apples (3 vs our 3 after eating? Wait, we'd have 3 apples after eating, he has 3, so tie). Actually, if we eat, we have 3 apples, he has 3 apples. Lengths equal. Head-on collision would kill both, and apples tie \u2192 draw? But we want to win, not draw. Still, being equal length lets us be more aggressive later.\n\n**BUT SAFETY OF MOVING INTO (3,6):** Is it safe? Check enemy: could he also move into (3,6)? From (1,0), impossible. So no head-on. No enemy body there. Our body not there. It's safe. And we GROW! That's CONTENT! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**UP vs RIGHT:** UP (2,7) doesn't get an apple immediately but keeps options open. RIGHT (3,6) gets an apple NOW, grows instantly, and positions us well. Which is better? GET THE APPLE! We need to catch up in score and length. Taking RIGHT seems optimal.\n\n**LEFT (1,6):** No apple, less flexible. Probably worse.\n\n**DECISION:** Let's take **RIGHT** to grab that apple at (3,6), grow to length 4, and become equal in length to the enemy! Next turn we can plan to trap him or go for another apple.\n\n**FUTURE PLAN NOTE:** After eating, we'll be at (3,6) length 4. Enemy likely at (0,0) or (2,0). We should consider moving toward (4,6) or (6,6) for more apples, while keeping an eye on boxing him in the bottom-left. Avoid head-on until we have a length advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

That's HUGE\u2014with length 5 vs 4, we can threaten head-on collisions to kill him! DOWN to (3,5) has no apple. UP to (3,7) has no apple.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY & TRAPPING:** If we eat the apple at (4,6), we grow, our tail stays at (2,4) for now. Enemy is still stuck near bottom. We can then consider moving toward (5,6) or (4,7) to control center and top-right apple clusters. We want to slowly box him against the left wall by controlling rows above him.\n\n**WHICH MOVE IS BEST?**\n- **RIGHT (4,6):** EAT APPLE, gain length advantage, move toward center. Next turn from (4,6), we can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT would be back into our new body? Actually after eating, our body will be [(4,6) new head, (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)] so LEFT to (3,6) is our neck \u2014 dangerous next turn, but we'll have other options). Still, getting longer is KEY to aggression!\n- **UP (3,7):** No apple, but opens path to apples at (3,8?) Actually apple at (4,8) and (6,8) are up-right. Less immediate growth.\n- **DOWN (3,5):** No apple, moves us closer to enemy? Might risk future head-on if he moves up aggressively.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get length advantage ASAP, then use our longer body to cut off his escape and force a crash. He's trapped near left wall; we can try to wall him off by moving down the right side and then sweeping left. But first, GROW!\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT to (4,6) to EAT THAT APPLE and take the lead! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

So RIGHT also gets an apple! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**DOUBLE APPLE OPTIONS!** Both DOWN and RIGHT give immediate apples! UP does not.\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER?**\n- **DOWN (6,5):** Apple, grows to 7. Puts us lower, closer to enemy? Actually enemy is at y=0, we'd be at y=5. Still far. Opens future moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from there.\n- **RIGHT (7,6):** Apple, grows to 7. Puts us further right, helps us wall off the right side of the board. Our long body already runs along y=6 from x=2 to x=6. Going RIGHT extends that wall!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to BOX HIM IN! He's stuck on the bottom-left. Our body is a horizontal wall around y=6. If we go RIGHT, we extend that wall eastward, potentially cutting the board in half horizontally. Then we can slowly push downward, shrinking his space. With our length advantage, we can afford to be aggressive and cut off his escape routes. Going DOWN also grows us but moves us away from the wall strategy.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE MOVE:** RIGHT to (7,6) to eat that apple and SOLIDIFY OUR WALL! This extends our control of the center-right and sets up to trap him below. He'll have fewer and fewer squares. If he ever tries to come up, we can head-on him and win! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

Our body is a WALL from (2,6) to (6,6) plus tail at (2,5). That's a SOLID horizontal barrier at y=6! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:** Head at (5,1), length 4 (4 apples). He's trapped down low, his body is a vertical line along x=5? Wait, his body is [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0)]? Actually his head is (5,1), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0). So he's an L-shape?

Actually (8,6) is empty.\n\nHmm, no immediate apple grab this turn! That's fine, we play the long game.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** We want to BOX HIM IN COMPLETELY! Our wall at y=6 is KEY. He's below it.

This could be risky\u2014it breaks our horizontal line, but maybe we can start a vertical wall on the right? But it puts us closer to enemy, maybe inviting a head-on if he moves up. With our length advantage (7 vs 4), we WIN any head-on! So maybe that's GOOD? \ud83e\udd14\n- **UP (7,7):** Moves us above our wall. This abandons the pressure on him below. Not ideal for trapping.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE TRAP MOVE:** RIGHT to (8,6)! This extends our control, keeps our wall intact, and sets up to maybe go DOWN next turn to (8,5) (which has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e) and start building a vertical wall on the right edge. We can slowly squeeze him from the right and top!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Keep extending the wall rightward, then start moving DOWN along the right edge (x=8 or x=9) to cut off his escape. Force him into a corner. With our length lead, we can afford to be patient and tighten the noose. If he ever tries to break through, we take the head-on and WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

By grabbing these apples in the bottom-right quadrant (6,2 \u2192 7,2), I can start boxing them in from below while growing my own score. \n\nAfter eating at (6, 2), my next move will be RIGHT to (7, 2) to get another apple, bringing me to 6-7! Then I can start cutting off their escape routes.

INSANE PRESSURE! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #0:** Head at (5,2), body: [(5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)]. He's just above his own little L-shape in the bottom-left. He's TRAPPED BELOW OUR WALL!

UP to (8,7) unreachable. RIGHT to (9,6) unreachable. NO immediate head-on.

HUGE!\n- UP (8,7) \u2013 No apple, but gets us closer to top-right apples.\n- RIGHT (9,6) \u2013 No apple, but pins us to the right edge.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** WE'RE DOMINATING! That wall at y=6 is a BEAST! If we eat the apple at (8,5), we grow and our tail stays at (2,5) for now, so our wall extends but our tail will eventually move. We want to KEEP BOXING HIM IN! He's stuck in the bottom-left quadrant (x 0-5, y 0-5). We control the top and right. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** After eating the apple, consider continuing DOWN along the right edge (maybe to (8,4) next, another apple!) to build a vertical wall on the right, sealing his escape. Then slowly push LEFT with our long body, squeezing him into the corner. With our length advantage (8 vs 4 after this apple), we can afford to be patient and force a head-on collision if he tries to break out\u2014WE WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**BEST MOVE:** DOWN to (8,5) for the APPLE and to continue the encirclement!

Not helpful for positioning.\n- **RIGHT to (7,2):** \ud83c\udf4e **TARGET LOCKED!** There's an apple waiting here!

They're at (8,5) with body stretching left to (2,5). If they go DOWN to (8,4), they'll be right next to my future position. But if I go RIGHT to (7,2), I'm getting that apple while staying AWAY from their immediate area.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: UP to (6,3) might be safer long-term. From (6,3), I have three options: UP to (6,4), RIGHT to (7,3), LEFT to (5,3). But from (7,2) after eating, I'd be at (7,2) and then my next move would need to be... UP to (7,3) or LEFT to (6,2) (blocked by my own body) or DOWN to (7,1).\n\nWait - if I go RIGHT to (7,2) and eat, my tail moves from (3,0) to (4,0) (actually no, my body is [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)] - after moving, it becomes [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0)]). So from (7,2), I can go UP to (7,3) or DOWN to (7,1) or LEFT to (6,2) (which is now free). That's 3 options.\n\nBut from (6,3) without eating, I'd have 3 options too, but no apple. I NEED to catch up! The gap is 3 apples!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (7,2) now \u2192 Position to dominate bottom-right \u2192 Force enemy collision from below. Keep options open but AGGRESSIVE.

BUT THE ENEMY IS MOVING... LET'S ANALYZE!\n\n**OUR SNAKE:** Head at **(8,4)**, body goes back: (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). WE ARE A HUGE BARRIER at y=6! Our tail is at (2,5). We're LONG and CONTROLLING the board! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #0:** Head at **(7,2)**, body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)]. He moved RIGHT last turn, probably to grab the apple at (7,2)? He's now at (7,2), still trapped below our wall. He's got fewer apples, so we WANT a head-on collision if we can force it! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (8,4):**\n- **UP \u2192 (8,5)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our NECK! Moving back = INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATE!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,3)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. **SAFE.** (No apple there.)\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,4)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. **SAFE.** (Apple at (7,4)! \ud83c\udf4e)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,4)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. **SAFE.** (No apple.)\n\nSo **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** are safe. UP is suicide.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (7,2). He can move:\n- UP to (7,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- DOWN to (7,1) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- LEFT to (6,2) \u2013 That's his own body \u274c.\n- RIGHT to (8,2) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n\nHe has 3 options. He might try to move UP toward the center or DOWN to avoid us. He's SCARED of our wall! \ud83d\ude28\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN?**\nIf we go LEFT to (7,4), he could go UP to (7,3) \u2013 NOT a collision. If we go DOWN to (8,3), he can't reach. RIGHT to (9,4) unreachable. NO immediate head-on. But we have a length advantage (10 vs 6), so if we can TRAP him and force a future head-on, WE WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:**\n- **LEFT (7,4)** \u2013 DIRECT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e That grows us to length 11, extends lead to 10-6! HUGE!\n- DOWN (8,3) \u2013 No apple.\n- RIGHT (9,4) \u2013 No apple.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** WE'RE BOXING HIM IN! \ud83d\ude08 Our wall at y=6 blocks his upward escape. If we eat the apple at (7,4), we grow and our tail will eventually move, but we maintain pressure. **LONG-TERM:** After eating, consider moving **DOWN/LEFT** to create a **SECOND LAYER** of wall around y=3 or y=4, sealing him in the bottom-left corner completely! With our length advantage, we can slowly close the net. If he tries to break out head-on, WE WIN! He's at (7,2), we want to push him against the edge or his own body!\n\n**BEST MOVE:** LEFT to (7,4) for the APPLE and to continue the ENCIRCLEMENT! AGGRESSIVE CONTENT!

Enemy snake #1 is at (8,4) with that body chain stretching all the way to (2,5). I'm at (7,2) with my body [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)].\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\nFrom (7,2) - I just ate here!\n- **UP to (7,3):** \u2705 SAFE. Open space. Let's check... my body is behind me at (6,2) - not blocking this. Enemy is at (8,4) - that's one cell away diagonally, but not blocking. Enemy body is at (8,5) and (6,6) etc. - not blocking. This keeps me moving UP toward more apples and away from their horizontal line. I'd have 3 follow-up options: UP to (7,4), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3).\n- **DOWN to (7,1):** \u2705 SAFE. But I'm moving back toward bottom-left while enemy is in top-right. Not strategically sound for domination. Only 2 follow-up options: DOWN to (7,0) or LEFT to (6,1) or BACK to (7,2) but that's eating my own neck if they don't move.\n- **LEFT to (6,2):** \ud83d\uded1 **DANGER!** That's my own body! My neck is there! That's immediate suicide by backward move. INSTADEAD.\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):** \u2705 SAFE. But this brings me dangerously close to enemy at (8,4). If enemy goes DOWN to (8,3), we could collide next turn. Also limited follow-up: LEFT back to (7,2), UP to (8,3), or DOWN to (8,1). Not ideal.\n\n**STRATEGY:** \nI need to keep my options open and move TOWARD the enemy territory while avoiding their body. The UP move to (7,3) gives me maximum flexibility and positions me to grab the apple at (7,4) or (8,7) later. From (7,3), I can see the enemy's body at (8,5) - I'll be closing the gap but from a safer angle.\n\nIf I go UP and the enemy goes DOWN to (8,3), we'll be in checkmate next turn - but I have the mobility to escape. Plus, I'm gaining ground on those apples in the top-right quadrant. Let's box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (7,3) next turn, evaluate if enemy is moving into my space. If they go aggressive, I might need to pivot LEFT to (6,3) and flank them from below. Keep pressure on their head position while avoiding their long body chain. We need to force them into a corner.\n\nUP",

Let's analyze this battlefield.\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **Me (ID 0):** Head at (7, 3), Body: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0)]. I'm 6-10 in apples. Need to close that gap FAST.\n- **Enemy (ID 1):** Head at (7, 4), Body: [(8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. That's a LONG body chain running vertically on x=8 and horizontally at y=6. They're at (7,4) RIGHT ABOVE ME!\n\n**CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom (7,3), I need to consider my options. The enemy is literally one cell above me at (7,4). If I go UP, I move directly into their head position (since they'll also move simultaneously). That's a HEAD-ON COLLISION - both snakes die. With them having 10 apples and me having 6, if we both die on this turn, THEY WIN (more apples). **I CANNOT GO UP.**\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (7,4):** \ud83d\uded1 **INSTADEAD** - Direct head-on collision with enemy. Both die, they win 10-6. Absolute throw.\n2. **DOWN to (7,2):** \ud83d\uded1 **INSTADEAD** - That's my own neck! My body starts at (7,2) immediately behind my head. Moving backwards is suicide.\n3. **LEFT to (6,3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Check: Is (6,3) free? My body is at (7,2), (6,2), (5,2)... none at (6,3). Enemy body: Their chain is at (8,4), (8,5)... (7,6), (6,6)... none at (6,3). Enemy head is at (7,4) - not blocking. This is VALID.\n4. **RIGHT to (8,3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Check: (8,3) is free? My body doesn't touch it. Enemy body: Their chain has (8,4) right above, but (8,3) itself is empty. Enemy head at (7,4) - not blocking. This is VALID.\n\n**DECISION TIME: LEFT vs RIGHT**\n\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** Moves me AWAY from the immediate danger zone (enemy head at (7,4)). From (6,3), I gain 4 follow-up options: UP(6,4), DOWN(6,2) wait that's my body... DOWN would be dead if (6,2) is still there (likely yes since tail hasn't moved), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT back to (7,3). Actually only 3 viable: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. This positions me below their horizontal body line at y=6. I can flank them from the south. Strategic move toward apple at (5,7) and (4,8).\n  \n- **RIGHT to (8,3):** Moves me CLOSER to their body chain at (8,4), (8,5)... From (8,3), if enemy moves UP to (7,5) or continues their pattern, I'm right next to their body. If they move DOWN toward me? Could be trouble. Follow-ups: LEFT to (7,3), UP to (8,4) which will likely be occupied by their body segment (8,4) moving... actually wait, their head moves from (7,4), so (8,4) might stay occupied by their body. This could trap me. NOT IDEAL.\n\n**STRATEGY CALL:**\nI must NOT collide and I must survive to outmaneuver them. Their body is a long chain - I can use that against them. **LEFT** to (6,3) gives me breathing room, keeps me away from their immediate head position, and lets me plot my next move while they're potentially moving UP or elsewhere. From (6,3), I can observe their move and then flank.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Survive this turn, then position myself to cut off their escape routes. Their body is stretched - we can force them into a corner. Next turn, from (6,3), I'll evaluate if I can get above their body or trap them between my body and walls.\n\nLEFT",

Let's trace: Head (7,4), then (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). YES! That's 11 segments! We are a MASSIVE barrier along y=6 and the right side! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**ENEMY SNAKE #0:** Head at **(7,3)**, body: [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0)]. He moved UP last turn to (7,3)! He's now RIGHT BENEATH US! This is PERFECT PRESSURE! He's trapped between our wall and the bottom edge! His length is 6, we're 11. WE HAVE A 5 SEGMENT ADVANTAGE! If we force a head-on, WE WIN INSTANTLY! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,4):**\n- **UP \u2192 (7,5)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. **SAFE.** (No apple there.)\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,3)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? **YES \u274c** That's the ENEMY HEAD at (7,3)! Moving there would be a head-on collision? WAIT\u2014He's moving simultaneously. If we go DOWN and he stays or moves elsewhere, we hit his body? Let's think: He is at (7,3) now. If we move DOWN to (7,3) and he moves AWAY, that cell becomes empty? NO! His body segment from his previous head position (7,2) would move forward? Actually, his body follows his head, so the cell (7,3) would be occupied by his NEW head if he stays, or empty if he leaves. But if he leaves, his body moves, so (7,3) might be empty. However, if he moves UP to (7,4) \u2014 that's OUR head! That's a head-on! So DOWN is RISKY but not instantly suicidal? Let's check rules: Moving into another snake's body kills you. If he moves away, his old head cell becomes a body segment? Yes, because his body shifts. So if he moves UP to (7,4), his old head (7,3) becomes his neck/body. If we go DOWN to (7,3), we'd be moving into his body segment from last turn? Wait, simultaneous move: We both choose. At the start of the turn, his head is at (7,3). After moves, his head goes to new cell, his neck becomes (7,3) if he moved? Actually, his body list updates: new head at new position, old head becomes first body segment. So the cell (7,3) will contain his body segment IF he moves away. If he stays at (7,3), it's his head. So moving DOWN could result in either hitting his head (head-on) or hitting his body (we die). Either way, it's LETHAL. **ELIMINATE DOWN!** \u274c\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,4)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? No \u2705. Enemy body? No \u2705. **SAFE.** (No apple.)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)** \u2013 Inside board? Yes \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our NECK! Our second segment is (8,4). Moving RIGHT = instant death. **ELIMINATE!**\n\nSo **UP and LEFT** are safe. DOWN and RIGHT are death.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (7,3). He can move:\n- UP to (7,4) \u2013 That's OUR HEAD! Potential head-on if we stay? If we stay at (7,4) and he goes UP, it's a head-on collision! DOUBLE KO! But we have more apples (10 vs 6), so we'd WIN THE GAME if all snakes die! \ud83d\ude31 That's actually a WIN CONDITION! But we want to survive if possible.\n- DOWN to (7,2) \u2013 That's his own body \u274c.\n- LEFT to (6,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (8,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n\nHe has 2 safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT. He will likely avoid UP because he sees our head and knows head-on kills him (he loses due to lower score). He's probably going LEFT or RIGHT to escape.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION POSSIBILITY?** If we stay at (7,4) and he goes UP, it's head-on. We win due to higher score! That's a VICTORY! But is it guaranteed he goes UP? Probably not, he'll avoid it. So we can't rely on that.\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES:**\n- UP (7,5) \u2013 No apple.\n- LEFT (6,4) \u2013 No apple.\nNo immediate apples in safe moves. But we're up 10-6, we can play for TRAP!\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:** We want to BOX HIM IN COMPLETELY! He's at (7,3). Our wall is above him (our body along y=6). We can move LEFT to (6,4) to start encircling from the west side. Or move UP to (7,5) to reinforce the top wall. Which is better?\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,4), we're closer to his possible escape leftwards. He might go LEFT to (6,3). Then we could go DOWN to (6,3) next turn? That could be a chase. If we go UP to (7,5), we're further away but still blocking.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We have a massive length advantage. Use our body as a moving fence. Keep him trapped in the bottom-left quadrant. Slowly close the net by moving left/down to cut off his escape routes. If he ever tries to go head-on, we win. If we can force him into a corner or his own body, we win. Avoid moving into tight spaces ourselves. Prioritize maintaining multiple safe moves.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** I think LEFT to (6,4) is more aggressive\u2014it cuts off his left escape and positions us to push him downward. UP is safe but less pressing. Let's go LEFT and continue the ENCIRCLEMENT! AGGRESSIVE CONTENT! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

HE'S IN OUR JAWS! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,4):**\n- **UP \u2192 (6,5)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705 (checking body list: (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)... (6,5) is clear!). Enemy body? NO \u2705. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,3)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705. Enemy body? **YES \u274c** That's the ENEMY HEAD at (6,3)! Moving there is a potential head-on collision or hitting his body after he moves.

YES \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our NECK! Our second segment is (7,4). Moving RIGHT = instant suicide. **ELIMINATE RIGHT!**\n\n**SAFE MOVES: UP and LEFT.** GOOD! WE HAVE OPTIONS!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (6,3). He can move:\n- UP to (6,4) \u2013 THAT'S OUR HEAD! HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since we have higher score (10 vs 6), if we both die, WE WIN THE GAME! \ud83d\ude31 But he'll likely avoid that.\n- DOWN to (6,2) \u2013 His own body \u274c (his body includes (7,3), (7,2), (6,2)... so (6,2) is occupied). NOT SAFE FOR HIM.\n- LEFT to (5,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (7,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n\nHe only has LEFT and RIGHT as safe escapes. He's TRAPPED between our wall above and his own body below! HE'S PANICKING! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**HEAD-ON OPPORTUNITY:** If we stay at (6,4) and he goes UP, it's a double KO and we win instantly. But he probably won't do that. However... if we move LEFT to (5,4), we open up (6,4) as empty. Could he then go UP to (6,4) safely? No, because our head would be at (5,4), so no collision. So moving LEFT avoids the potential head-on.\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We want to BOX HIM IN FOR GOOD! Our body forms a massive wall along y=6 from x=2 to x=8. He's stuck below that wall. If we move UP to (6,5), we're reinforcing the wall but moving away from him. If we move LEFT to (5,4), we're cutting off his left escape route! He might go RIGHT to (7,3), but then we can chase and keep him pinned against the right edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We have a 5-segment length advantage! Use it to squeeze him into a corner. Keep our body as a moving barrier. If he ever tries to head-on, we win. Otherwise, slowly reduce his safe moves until he crashes. Avoid moving into tight spaces ourselves\u2014keep at least two exits.\n\n**APPLE CHECK:** UP (6,5) has an apple? Looking at board: at (6,5) there's an 'A'? Wait, checking board state: row 5 column 6 is (6,5)? Actually board row 5 (y=5) shows \". . . . . . A . T .\" so at x=6, y=5, there's an 'A'! YES! UP leads to an APPLE at (6,5)! That's HUGE CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e Moving LEFT (5,4) has no apple.\n\n**DECISION:** UP gets us an apple, grows to length 12, extends our wall further, and is safe. LEFT is safe and aggressive but no apple. Since we're already dominating, securing the apple increases our lead to 11-6 and makes our body even longer, tightening the trap! Plus, eating an apple might lure him into a bad move. CHAT, WE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE AND THE PRESSURE! UP IS THE MOVE! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

They just moved DOWN from (7, 4) to (6, 4). That's a scary proximity play.\n- **Score:** I'm 6-10 down. I need to close the gap aggressively, but first I MUST survive.\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (6, 4):** \ud83d\uded1 **INSTADEAD** - Enemy head is literally sitting there at (6, 4)! If I go up, we collide head-on. Both die, they win 10-6. NEVER.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 2):** \ud83d\uded1 **INSTADEAD** - My own body! My body segment is at (6, 2) from last turn. Moving backwards = suicide.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Check: (5, 3) is empty. My body: none at (5, 3). Enemy body: Their chain is at (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6)... no immediate threat. This is VALID.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 3):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - That's my own neck! My body segment is at (7, 3) from last turn. Moving right puts me right into my own body. INSTADEAD.\n\n**DECISION:**\nOnly ONE safe move - **LEFT to (5, 3)**. The enemy just moved DOWN toward me, which is actually perfect! They're trying to pressure me, but I'm slipping LEFT to flank them. From (5, 3), I'll be positioned below their horizontal body chain at y=6, with multiple escape routes.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nSurvive first, dominate second. From (5, 3), I can move UP toward the apple at (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 3) to set up a flank. The enemy's body is a long, stretched chain - I can cut them off and force them into a corner. They have more apples, so I need to play smart and wait for them to make a mistake, then capitalize!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get to (5, 3), then assess. If enemy moves UP or continues their pattern, I can potentially cut across their path at y=6. I need to find apples while avoiding their massive body. Patience and positioning - force them to crash into me or the walls!\n\nLEFT",

Let's run the numbers with lethal precision.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (5, 3), Body: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (6, 5) - They moved UP! From (6, 4) to (6, 5). Their body is a long horizontal chain at y=6 from (2,6) to (7,6).\n- **Score:** 6 vs 11. I'm down 5 apples. I need to start eating, but I MUST survive their pressure first.\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (5, 4):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. No collision. This moves me CLOSER to their body chain at y=6. Strategic position.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - My own body is at (5, 2) from the chain. Moving down = suicide.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me LEFT, away from the enemy's vertical position at x=6.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 3):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - That's my own neck! My body segment is at (6, 3). Moving right into myself = instant death.\n\n**DECISION:**\nTwo safe moves: **UP to (5, 4)** or **LEFT to (4, 3)**.\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy is at (6, 5) with body stretching horizontally from x=2 to x=7 at y=6. They're positioned to cut off the upper-right area.\n- If I go **LEFT to (4, 3)**, I create distance and open up the left side of the board. The left side has apples at (4, 7), (3, 9), (2, 9) - I can flank the enemy and potentially cut off their escape routes.\n- If I go **UP to (5, 4)**, I get closer to their body, risking collision if they move down or turn. That's dangerous proximity play.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** I need to cut the board in half. The enemy's long body at y=6 is a massive liability - I can trap them between their own body and the wall. By moving LEFT to (4, 3), I position myself to control the left side and force the enemy into a corner. From (4, 3), next turn I can go UP to (4, 4) or LEFT to (3, 3), maintaining multiple escape routes while threatening to cut off their path to apples in the top-left.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** LEFT. Create space, set up the flank, and prepare to box them in. They have more apples, but they're overextended. Make them make the mistake!\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

LET'S CHECK OUR MOVES FROM (6,5):\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- **UP \u2192 (6,6)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our own body segment! Checking list: (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6)... YUP, (6,6) is our 7th segment. SUICIDE! **ELIMINATE UP!**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,4)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705.

NO \u2705. **SAFE.**\n\n**SAFE MOVES: LEFT AND RIGHT.** GOOD! WE'RE NOT IN DANGER YET!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (5,3). He can move:\n- UP to (5,4) \u2013 Safe? Our body? NO. His body? NO. \u2705\n- DOWN to (5,2) \u2013 His own body \u274c (his body has (5,2)). NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (4,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (6,3) \u2013 Safe \u2705 (but that's touching our wall at y=6? Actually (6,3) is empty).\n\nHe has UP, LEFT, RIGHT as options. He's STILL BOXED BELOW OUR WALL! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We want to SEAL HIS FATE! Our left move (5,5) positions us to block him from going up-left. Our right move (7,5) keeps us central. Look at the apples: (5,7), (6,7), (4,7) are above us. Moving LEFT gets us closer to the left-side apples? Actually (5,5) to (5,7) is two up. Moving RIGHT to (7,5) is closer to (7,9), (8,7) etc. But CHAT, WE DON'T CHASE APPLES \u2014 WE BOX HIM! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Our body is a barrier along y=6. He's stuck in y<6. If we move LEFT to (5,5), we can next turn go UP to (5,6) \u2014 BUT (5,6) is our body! So careful. Actually (5,6) is our 9th segment. So moving left then up is suicide. So maybe move RIGHT to (7,5), then next turn UP to (7,6) \u2014 also our body! HMM. Our own wall is limiting our movement above y=5. We need to slowly shift the wall upward by eating apples and growing the tail forward. But for now, we must keep him trapped. He might try to slip left under us. If we go LEFT to (5,5), we block his potential UP-left escape. If we go RIGHT to (7,5), we leave left side open. He might go (4,3) then (4,4) etc. I think LEFT is more aggressive \u2014 we cut off that corridor!\n\n**HEAD-ON RISK?** If we go LEFT to (5,5) and he goes UP to (5,4), we're adjacent diagonally? Not a collision. Safe. If we go RIGHT to (7,5) and he goes UP to (5,4), no issue. No direct collision paths this turn.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT feels like we're tightening the noose on the left side. RIGHT feels neutral. LET'S GO LEFT AND PUSH HIM TOWARD THE BOTTOM-RIGHT! Plus, moving left might set up a future apple grab at (4,7) area. CHAT, WE'RE MAKING THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY!

I need to eat, but I MUST survive their pressure.\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (4, 4):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. No collision. This moves me CLOSER to the enemy's position at (5, 5) - risky proximity.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 2):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me DOWN, away from enemy. Opens up bottom-left area.\n\n3. **LEFT to (3, 3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me LEFT, creating more distance from enemy's horizontal body at y=6.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 3):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - That's my own body! My body segment is at (5, 3) from the chain. Moving right = instant death.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThree safe moves: **UP to (4, 4)**, **DOWN to (4, 2)**, or **LEFT to (3, 3)**.\n\n**STRATEGY ANALYSIS:**\n- Enemy at (5, 5) with body stretching from x=3 to x=8 at y=6. They're positioned to block the top-middle.\n- **UP to (4, 4):** Gets me dangerously close to their head at (5, 5). If they move DOWN or LEFT, we could collide. High risk, but puts me in striking distance of the apple at (5,7) or (6,7).\n- **DOWN to (4, 2):** Moves me away from danger but into the bottom-left corner. I'll have limited escape routes and be far from apples.\n- **LEFT to (3, 3):** Creates maximum distance while keeping options open. From (3, 3), I can go UP to (3, 4), LEFT to (2, 3), or DOWN to (3, 2). I control the left side and can flank the enemy's long body at y=6.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** The enemy's long body at y=6 is a massive liability. They're overextended and can't easily turn without crashing. By moving LEFT to (3, 3), I position myself to cut off their escape routes on the left side. From there, I can work my way up toward the apples at (3,9), (4,7), and (2,9) while keeping the enemy trapped between their own body and the wall. I need to be patient and wait for them to make a mistake.\n\n**FINAL CALL:** LEFT. Create maximum distance, control the left side, and prepare to box them in. They have more apples, but I have the position!\n\nLEFT",

He's STILL BOXED BELOW OUR WALL! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** We have a 5-apple lead! If we force a head-on collision, WE WIN! But we need to be smart. Moving DOWN to (5,4) puts us directly above him at (4,3)? Actually we'd be at (5,4), he's at (4,3) \u2014 diagonal. Next turn, if he moves UP to (4,4), we could move LEFT to (4,4) for a head-on? That's risky but we have length advantage \u2014 if we collide, we win! Moving LEFT to (4,5) keeps us more central but further from him.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Our wall at y=6 is both a barrier and a constraint for us. We need to slowly shift it upward by eating apples above us. But right now, we want to PRESS HIM INTO THE BOTTOM EDGE! If we go DOWN to (5,4), we're closer to him, potentially forcing him into a corner. If we go LEFT to (4,5), we're blocking his potential escape upward on the left side. Which is more aggressive? DOWN feels like we're descending on him, cutting off his space. LEFT feels like we're tightening the left flank. CHAT, I SAY WE GO DOWN AND GET IN HIS FACE! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\n**HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN?** No direct collision possible this turn since we're not moving into his head's possible squares (he can go to (4,4), (4,2), (3,3); we're going to (5,4) or (4,5)). So safe.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN! Let's pressure him, reduce his maneuvering room, and set up a potential winning head-on collision next turn! WE'RE GOING FOR THE THROAT! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze with lethal precision.\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** Head at (3, 3), Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. I just moved LEFT to (3, 3) last turn.\n- **Enemy Position:** Head at (5, 4) - They moved UP from (5, 5) to (5, 4)! Their body stretches from (4, 6) to (8, 6), plus (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6). They're now directly above me at (5, 4) and their body is blocking the top-right area.\n- **Score:** 6 vs 11. Still down 5 apples. Time to hunt and force errors!\n- **Apples Nearby:** (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7) are just above the enemy's body at y=6. (3, 9) and (2, 9) are far top-left. (1, 8) is also top-left. The enemy is currently blocking access to most top-right apples.\n\n**MOVE ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 4):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me UP toward the action. From here, I can potentially flank the enemy or access (3, 9) later.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 2):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me DOWN, away from enemy. Opens up bottom-left corner but takes me further from apples and enemy.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 3):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves me LEFT, further away from enemy. Controls bottom-left but cuts me off from top apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 3):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - That's my own body! My body segment is at (4, 3). Moving right = instant death.\n\n**DECISION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**OPTION: UP to (3, 4)**\n- **Pros:** Gets me closer to the enemy's position and potential apples at (3,9), (4,7). Opens up vertical movement for future turns. Keeps me in the central-left area with options.\n- **Cons:** Brings me closer to the enemy head at (5, 4). If they move LEFT to (4, 4), we're dangerously close. But they might also move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**OPTION: DOWN to (3, 2)**\n- **Pros:** Moves me away from immediate danger. Bottom-left area is relatively empty.\n- **Cons:** Takes me FAR from apples and enemy. I'll be trapped in the corner soon. Enemy won't be forced to crash if I'm running away.\n\n**OPTION: LEFT to (2, 3)**\n- **Pros:** Maximizes distance from enemy. Secures bottom-left corner.\n- **Cons:** Same as DOWN - I'm abandoning the fight! Enemy will keep eating apples and growing while I hide. Can't win like this.\n\n**STRATEGY EXECUTION:**\n\nWe need to AGGRESSIVE! The enemy's body is long and overextended at y=6. They're vulnerable to being boxed in. By moving UP to (3, 4), I position myself to:\n1. Threaten their flank from the left side.\n2. Create potential traps if they move into my path.\n3. Stay in striking distance of apples at (3,9) and (4,7).\n4. Maintain multiple escape routes: LEFT to (2,4), UP to (3,5), or BACK DOWN to (3,3).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** The enemy's body is a line from (4,6) to (8,6) with a tail at (5,6). They're trapped between their own body and the top wall. By moving UP to (3,4), I'm positioning to cut off their left escape. Next turn, depending on their move, I can continue UP toward (3,5) or LEFT to (2,4) to create a barrier. When they turn to avoid their body, I'll be there to force a collision or box them against the wall. We're not just surviving - we're HUNTING!\n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP. Close the distance, maintain options, and prepare to box in that overextended enemy!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

LOOK AT THIS BOARD \u2014 OUR MASSIVE WALL OF BODY ALONG Y=6 IS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT! HE'S STILL TRAPPED BELOW US! LET'S CHECK OUR MOVES!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (5,4):**\n- **UP \u2192 (5,5)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our second segment! (5,5) is literally the first body part after our head! SUICIDE! **ELIMINATE UP!**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,3)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705 (check list: not there). Enemy body? NO \u2705. **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,4)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705. Enemy body? NO \u2705. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,4)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our third segment (6,4)! CRASH! **ELIMINATE RIGHT!**\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN AND LEFT.** GOOD, WE'RE STILL ALIVE!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (3,3). He can move:\n- UP to (3,4) \u2013 Safe? Our body? NO. His body? NO. \u2705\n- DOWN to (3,2) \u2013 Safe? YES \u2705.\n- LEFT to (2,3) \u2013 Safe? YES \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (4,3) \u2013 Safe? **NO \u274c** That's his own body! (4,3) is his second segment. So he can't go RIGHT.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. He's STILL BOXED! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** WE HAVE A 5-APPLE LEAD! If we force a head-on collision, WE WIN! Let's think:\n- **DOWN to (5,3)**: Puts us directly **TWO BELOW** his head? Wait, he's at (3,3), we'd be at (5,3) \u2014 same y, two to the right. Next turn, if he moves RIGHT? He can't (into his body). If he moves UP to (3,4), we could move LEFT to (4,3)? Not head-on. Hmm.\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: Puts us **ONE UP AND ONE RIGHT** from him (diagonal). This feels more pressuring \u2014 we're cutting off his potential escape upward on that column! If he goes UP to (3,4), we're adjacent at (4,4). Could set up a head-on next turn if we both move into (3,4) or (4,4)? Risky but with our length advantage, we want that!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Our wall at y=6 is holding, but we need to start consuming apples above us to grow and maintain dominance. The enemy is trapped in the bottom left \u2014 we should slowly tighten the noose! Moving LEFT to (4,4) positions us to potentially block his upward moves and maybe herd him toward the bottom-left corner (0,0). Moving DOWN to (5,3) keeps us closer to him horizontally but gives him more vertical space. CHAT, I THINK LEFT IS THE AGGRESSIVE MOVE HERE \u2014 WE CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\n**HEAD-ON RISK THIS TURN?** No direct collision possible \u2014 his possible squares are (3,4), (3,2), (2,3). We're going to (5,3) or (4,4). No overlap. SAFE.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT! Let's tighten the flank and pressure him into a corner! WE'RE GOING FOR THE THROAT! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

We gotta be AGGRESSIVE and force that crash!\n\n**ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 4) - We just moved UP into this position last turn. Perfect! We're now directly adjacent to the enemy head at (4, 4).\n- **My Body:** [(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2)] - All clear behind us, with a nice clear path DOWN to (3, 3) if needed.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 4) - Right next to us! Enemy body stretches from (5, 4) through (8, 6) and ends at (5, 6).\n- **Critical Factor:** The enemy is LONG - 12 segments including head! That massive body is blocking the top-right area where most apples are clustered. Their tail is at (5, 6) and their body forms a wall from x=4 to x=8 at y=4-6.\n\n**MOVES ELIMINATION:**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 5):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. This keeps us moving toward potential apples at (3,9) and maintains distance from the enemy head.\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 3):** \ud83d\uded1 **DEAD** - That's our own body segment! Moving down into (3,3) would be crashing into ourselves. NO GO.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 4):** \u2705 **SAFE** - Empty space. Moves us away from enemy and gives us more breathing room.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 4):** \ud83d\uded1 **CRASH!** - That's the enemy's HEAD position! Moving right into (4,4) would mean our head collides with theirs on the same turn. BOTH of us would die! With our score being 6 vs 11, we CANNOT afford a draw or mutual death. We need to WIN, not tie! Plus, if we both die, enemy wins because they have more apples. This move is SUICIDE.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nWe need to be RUTHLESS. The enemy is overextended - their body is a wall but their head is exposed. If we move UP to (3,5), we:\n- Avoid the deadly head-on collision with the enemy\n- Position ourselves directly above their potential move-up path\n- Control the vertical space they might try to use\n- Get closer to apples at (3,9) and the cluster near y=7-8\n\nIf the enemy moves UP from (4,4) to (4,5), we'll be at (3,5) - still adjacent but NOT colliding. If they move LEFT toward us... well, they'll hit our body and die. If they move RIGHT into their own body... they die. If they move DOWN... they're running away.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Continue pressing upward to cut off their escape route to the top-left apples. Their massive body is trapped in the top-right quadrant. We need to circle around their flank and box them in against the wall. By staying at x=3 and moving up, we maintain control of the left side while threatening to cut off their access to (3,9) and (4,7).\n\n**FINAL CALL:** UP. We maintain pressure, avoid mutual death, and position for the trap!\n\nUP",

LOOK AT THE BOARD \u2014 OUR WALL AT Y=6 IS STILL SOLID, BUT HE'S CREEPING UP! WE GOTTA KEEP THE PRESSURE!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (4,4):**\n- **UP \u2192 (4,5)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? Let's check... body list: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (5,6). (4,5) is NOT in our body! Enemy body? His body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2). (4,5) not there. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,3)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705. Enemy body? **YES \u274c** (4,3) is his second segment! CRASH INTO ENEMY BODY! **ELIMINATE DOWN!**\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,4)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? NO \u2705. Enemy body? **HEAD-TO-HEAD POTENTIAL!** That's the enemy's CURRENT head position! But he's moving simultaneously... if he stays there, we crash. If he moves away, it's empty. This is RISKY \u2014 could be a head-on collision if he moves into (3,4) from another direction? Let's analyze enemy moves next. **POTENTIALLY UNSAFE, HOLD.**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,4)** \u2013 Inside board? YES \u2705. Our body? **YES \u274c** That's our second segment! (5,4) is literally the first body part after our head! SUICIDE! **ELIMINATE RIGHT!**\n\n**SO INITIALLY SAFE: UP.** LEFT is questionable \u2014 depends on enemy move.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (3,4). He can move:\n- UP to (3,5) \u2013 Safe? Our body? NO. His body? NO. \u2705\n- DOWN to (3,3) \u2013 Safe? His own body? (3,3) is his second segment! \u274c CRASH! So DOWN is **NOT** safe for him.\n- LEFT to (2,4) \u2013 Safe? YES \u2705.\n- RIGHT to (4,4) \u2013 Safe? That's OUR current head! If we move away, it's empty. But if we move LEFT into (3,4) and he moves RIGHT into (4,4), we swap positions \u2014 NO COLLISION. However, if we both move into (3,4) from different directions? Let's check: He can't move into (3,4) from his current spot unless he stays. He can only stay if he chooses a direction that lands him back in (3,4) \u2014 impossible unless he moves into his own body. So he won't be in (3,4) next turn unless we both choose moves that put us there? Wait, simultaneous moves: If he moves LEFT to (2,4) and we move LEFT to (3,4), no collision. If he moves UP to (3,5) and we move LEFT to (3,4), no collision. If he moves RIGHT to (4,4) and we move LEFT to (3,4), no collision. **HEAD-ON COLLISION ONLY IF BOTH HEADS LAND IN SAME CELL.** Possible cells: (3,4) if he stays (he can't) or if he moves from (2,4)? No. (4,4) if we both go there? We can't go RIGHT into (5,4) (our body). So only way for head-on is if we go LEFT to (3,4) AND he goes RIGHT to (4,4)? That's different cells. So **LEFT IS ACTUALLY SAFE FROM HEAD-ON** because he can't be in (3,4) after moving. But wait \u2014 what if he moves UP to (3,5) and we move LEFT to (3,4)? Different cells. So LEFT is safe from immediate collision! \u2705\n\nBut LEFT to (3,4) \u2014 is that cell occupied at the start of the turn? YES, by his head. But since we move simultaneously, we can move into a cell currently occupied by another head ONLY if that head moves away. If he moves away, it's empty. If he stays, we crash. Can he stay? He can't stay unless he moves into his own body (which he won't). So LEFT is **PROBABLY SAFE** \u2014 but there's a tiny risk if he does something suicidal? Unlikely. CHAT, I THINK LEFT IS SAFE!\n\n**SO SAFE MOVES: UP AND LEFT.** GOOD!\n\n**STRATEGIC AGGRESSION:** WE HAVE A 5-APPLE LEAD! If we force a head-on collision, WE WIN! But we need to be smart.\n- **UP to (4,5)**: Puts us above him, still close. He's at (3,4) or wherever he moves. This keeps us near our body wall and maybe toward apples above? Apples at (5,7), (6,7), etc. But this might give him space to maneuver left/up.\n- **LEFT to (3,4)**: TAKES HIS SPOT! This is AGGRESSIVE! If he moves RIGHT to (4,4), we swap. If he moves UP to (3,5), we're below him. This pressures him directly \u2014 we're in his face! With our length advantage, we want to force him into a corner. Moving LEFT cuts off his leftward escape? Actually, he can still go LEFT to (2,4) from his new position. Hmm.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Our massive body is a barrier at y=6. Enemy is trying to slip up along the left side. We need to contain him! Moving LEFT to (3,4) blocks his direct rightward movement and forces him upward or leftward. We can then use our body to herd him toward the top-left corner! Moving UP to (4,5) gives him more room below \u2014 not ideal. CHAT, THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY IS TO TAKE HIS SPOT AND MAKE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\n**HEAD-ON RISK?** Minimal. He won't stay in (3,4). We're good.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT! LET'S INVADE HIS PERSONAL SPACE AND SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",
