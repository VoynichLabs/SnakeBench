The closest apple to me seems to be (5,3), but let's evaluate distances.\n\nDistance to (5,3): |3-5| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 (Manhattan distance)  \nDistance to (8,0): |3-8| + |0-0| = 5 \u2192 also 5  \nDistance to (0,5): |3-0| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8  \nOthers are farther.\n\nBut (8,0) is on the same row (y=0), just to the right. That's only 5 units away, and since I'm at (3,0), moving right toward x=8 is efficient.\n\nHowever, I must avoid crashing. Currently, I have no body, so I can move freely as long as I don't hit walls or other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,6), far away, so no immediate threat.\n\nBut if I go for (8,0), that\u2019s along the bottom row. But wait \u2014 apple (8,0) is at (8,0). That's on the same row as me! I'm at (3,0). So from (3,0), moving RIGHT four times gets me to (7,0), then (8,0) on the fifth \u2014 that is valid.\n\nBut I need to make the first move now.\n\nFrom (3,0):\n- UP \u2192 (3,1) \u2014 safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,-1) \u2192 invalid (out of bounds) \u2192 **DEATH**\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,0) \u2014 safe\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,0) \u2014 safe\n\nSo DOWN is invalid. I cannot go down.\n\nSo options: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I want to go to (8,0), I should go RIGHT.\n\nBut is (8,0) already being targeted? Not clear. But it's far from the enemy at (2,6), so likely safe.\n\nAlternatively, (5,3) might be a better long-term goal \u2014 it's more central. But requires moving UP and RIGHT.\n\nFrom (3,0) to (5,3): need to increase x by 2, y by 3. So a combination of RIGHT and UP moves.\n\nBut I can only move one step now.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,0), then I\u2019m closer to (5,3) and also still in position to go for (8,0).\n\nBut (5,3) might be closer in path if I start moving up soon.\n\nBut moving UP from (3,0) to (3,1) doesn't directly get me closer to (8,0), while RIGHT does.\n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT repeatedly, I can get (8,0) in 5 moves, and grow. That gives me length, which helps survival.\n\nAlso, once I grow, I have a body \u2014 so I must start avoiding myself.\n\nAnother thought: the apple at (0,5) and (0,9) are on the left edge. I'm on the bottom right. Not close. Similarly, (2,8) is top left.\n\nSo (5,3) and (8,0) are the only realistic targets.\n\n(5,3) is at distance |3-5| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5  \n(8,0) is |3-8| = 5, same.\n\nBut (8,0) is reachable in a straight line (just right), no turns needed.\n\n(5,3) requires both right and up moves, so more complex path.\n\nSo (8,0) is simpler.\n\nAlso, if I go for (8,0), I can get there fast, grow early, and then reposition.\n\nNo enemies near.\n\nSo strategy: go for the apple at (8,0) by moving RIGHT repeatedly.\n\nCurrent position: (3,0). Move RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 safe.\n\nNo obstacles.\n\nAlso, no risk of self-collision since I\u2019m length 1.\n\nSo best move now: RIGHT.\n\nI will head east (RIGHT) along the bottom row toward (8,0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving RIGHT unless the apple is taken or a threat appears. After picking up an apple, reassess based on new position and apple availability.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm still on the bottom row (y=0), and my goal is to reach the apple at (8, 0), which is on the same row and 4 units to the right. This is a straight-line path with no obstacles, and since I have no body, self-collision is not a concern yet.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate current options from (4, 0):\n- **UP** \u2192 (4, 1): valid and safe\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4, -1): invalid \u2192 **WALL \u2192 DEATH**\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 0): valid, but moving backward along my path \u2014 not ideal unless fleeing, which is unnecessary\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 0): valid, gets me closer to (8, 0)\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (2, 7), far away and not threatening any immediate collision. The other apples \u2014 (0,5), (0,9), (2,8), (5,3) \u2014 are all much farther away or require navigation through the center, which could put me at risk later.\n\nThe apple at (8, 0) is highly accessible, on the edge, and reachable in just 4 more RIGHT moves. Securing it quickly will give me +1 point, grow my length to 2, and allow me to start planning longer-term movement with more presence on the board.\n\nThere is no indication that the enemy is moving toward (8, 0), and given their position, it\u2019s unlikely they will reach it before I do if I continue rightward.\n\nThus, my current strategy remains: **Move RIGHT repeatedly to reach the apple at (8, 0) as quickly as possible.**\n\nAfter I eat the apple, I will be at (8, 0) with a body segment at (7, 0), so I must remember not to move LEFT immediately afterward (as that would crash into myself). But that\u2019s a decision for future turns.\n\nFor now, best move is clearly RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy reminder for next turn:** Continue moving RIGHT unless apple is taken or board state changes drastically.

Staying in the interior (1, 8) is slightly safer and more flexible than moving to the edge (2, 9). It also reduces the Manhattan distance to the X-coordinate of the target immediately.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move **LEFT** to (1, 8).\n2.  Next turn, move **UP** to (1, 9).\n3.

I\u2019m continuing my westward journey toward the apple cluster on the left.

Looking at the board \u2014 (6,2) is '.' \u2192 safe \u2192 valid.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,0)**: Within bounds. (6,0) is '.' \u2192 empty \u2192 valid.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,1)**: Within bounds. (5,1)?

But doesn't get me closer to any apple. (5,3) is two up and one left \u2014 could be a setup move, but not urgent.\n   - Might be useful later if I'm going for (5,3), but currently not optimal for progress.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,0)**:\n   - Safe. But I'd go to (6,0), which is slightly toward (4,1) but not directly. (4,1) is still at y=1, so going down to y=0 might be inefficient.\n   - Could help me move toward (0,0), but (4,1) is much closer and worth grabbing first.\n   - Risk of getting stuck on the bottom edge again.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,1)**:\n   - Direct progress toward the apples.\n   - (5,1) is empty \u2192 safe.\n   - From (5,1), I can then go to (4,1), where there\u2019s an apple \u2192 I\u2019ll eat it and grow.\n   - This is the most direct and efficient path.\n\nThe (4,1) apple is only **two moves away** if I go LEFT twice: (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1). And I\u2019ll grow after eating it \u2014 good momentum.\n\nEnemy snake is up at (0,6)\u2013(0,8), far away. No threat on the bottom middle. The left side is wide open.\n\nStaying on the y=1 row is great \u2014 allows access to both (4,1) apple and upward access to (5,3) later.\n\nTherefore, **LEFT is the best move** \u2014 continues efficient, safe progress toward the nearest apple.\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After moving to (5,1), I will aim for (4,1) next \u2014 it\u2019s an apple, so I'll grow. Once I grow, my tail will stay put, so I need to plan my turn: after eating (4,1), I\u2019ll have to decide whether to go UP to (4,2) to target (5,3), or continue left to go for the (0,3)/(0,5) cluster. But that\u2019s for soon \u2014 for now, keep moving left.\n\nLEFT",

Let's verify:\n\nWait \u2014 correction:  \nWhen we ate the apple at (4,1), we grew, so the body expanded and the tail **stayed in place** \u2014 meaning the segment at (6,1) remains part of the body **this turn**.\n\nSo current body:  \n- Head: (4,2)  \n- Next: (4,1)  \n- Next: (5,1)  \nBut wait \u2014 previously, before eating, we were:  \n- Head: (5,1) \u2192 no, let's recheck the **last rationale** carefully.\n\n**From last rationale**:\n> - Head at: **(4,1)**  \n> - Body: **[(5,1), (6,1)]**\n\nWait \u2014 that seems backward. If head is at (4,1), and body is (5,1), then snake is moving **left**, which makes sense because last move was LEFT.\n\nSo body order:  \n- Head: (4,1)  \n- Body[0]: (5,1)  \n- Body[1]: (6,1)\n\nThen we ate the apple at (4,1), grew, so this turn:\n- Head moves to **(4,2)** via **UP**\n- Body becomes: (4,1), (5,1) \u2014 and tail does **not** advance because we grew\n- So full snake now:\n  - Head: (4,2)\n  - Body: (4,1), (5,1)\n  - Tail still (5,1)? Wait, no \u2014 length is now 4? Or was it?\n\nWait, confusion here. Let\u2019s clarify:\n\nOriginal snake before last move:\n- Head: (5,1)\n- Body: (6,1) \u2014 so two segments\n\nThen moved **LEFT** to (4,1), ate apple \u2192 so we **grew**, meaning length increased from 2 to 3.\n\nThus, after growth:\n- Head: (4,1)\n- Body: (5,1), (6,1)\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nNow current turn: we chose **UP** to (4,2)\n\nSo now:\n- Head: (4,2)\n- Body: (4,1), (5,1)\n- Tail: (5,1)? No \u2014 tail should be (6,1) \u2014 because when we grow, tail doesn\u2019t move.\n\nAh! Important: when a snake grows, **on the next turn, it moves normally \u2014 but tail does not advance**.\n\nBut in this case:\n\n- Turn N-1: head at (5,1), body (6,1) \u2014 length 2\n- Move LEFT to (4,1) \u2014 which had apple \u2192 so eat and grow \u2192 length becomes 3\n- So after move: head (4,1), body (5,1), tail (6,1) \u2014 so **(6,1)** is still part of body\n\nThen **this turn** (current turn): we move from (4,1) to (4,2) \u2014 UP\n\nAfter this move:\n- Head: (4,2)\n- Body: (4,1), (5,1)\n- Tail: (6,1) \u2192 will vacate (6,1) this turn, **unless** we grow again.\n\nSo currently, body occupies: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) \u2014 and (6,1) is still occupied by tail until this move completes.\n\nSo during movement, (6,1) will be vacated **after** we move.\n\nNow, apples at: (5,3), (0,0), (0,2), (7,7), (5,7)\n\nCurrent head: (4,2)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,3)**\n  - In bounds? Yes\n  - Is it occupied? (4,3): looking at board \u2014 currently '.' \u2192 **empty**\n  - Also not in our body: our body is (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1) \u2014 (4,3) is not among them \u2192 safe\n  - Leads toward (5,3) apple? Yes \u2014 from (4,3), can go RIGHT to (5,3) next turn\n  - Strong option\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,1)**\n  - (4,1) is currently occupied by our body \u2014 it\u2019s the first body segment behind head\n  - Moving back into own body \u2192 **collision \u2192 death**\n  - **Invalid**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,2)**\n  - (3,2): '.' on board \u2192 looks empty\n  - Not part of our body \u2192 safe\n  - But moves away from (5,3) \u2014 not optimal\n  - Could lead toward center or other paths, but no immediate benefit\n  - Less efficient\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,2)**\n  - (5,2): board shows '.' \u2192 empty\n  - Not in our body \u2192 safe\n  - From (5,2), can then go UP to (5,3) \u2192 which has an apple!\n  - So from (5,2) \u2192 UP to (5,3): direct path to apple in **two moves**\n  - Compare with UP \u2192 (4,3), then (4,4) or (5,3)? (4,3) to (5,3) is adjacent \u2192 yes, (5,3) is right of (4,3)\n\nWait: (4,2) \u2192 UP to (4,3), then \u2192 RIGHT to (5,3): that\u2019s also two moves\n\nSo both **UP** and **RIGHT** lead to (5,3) in 2 moves.\n\nBut is one better?\n\nLet\u2019s compare:\n\nOption 1: UP to (4,3)\n- (4,3): safe\n- Then RIGHT to (5,3): yes, valid\n- From (4,3), (5,3) is to the east \u2192 no problem\n\nOption 2: RIGHT to (5,2)\n- (5,2): is '.' \u2014 empty\n- But wait \u2014 is it occupied by anything?\n\nLook at board:\n\nRow 2: \n- (0,2): A\n- (4,2): 1 (me)\n- (5,2): '.' \u2014 yes, empty\n- (7,2): '.'\n\nSo (5,2) is free.\n\nAlso, after we move, (6,1) will be vacated \u2014 so no issue.\n\nBut: enemy snake is at (0,3), body down to (0,7) \u2014 so vertical on left edge. Not a threat.\n\nNow, which move is better: UP or RIGHT?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **obstacles or risks**:\n\n- After RIGHT to (5,2): body becomes (4,2), (4,1) \u2014 and tail (5,1) vacates (6,1), so new tail is (5,1)\n- Then next move: UP to (5,3) \u2192 apple!\n\n- After UP to (4,3): body is (4,2), (4,1), and (5,1) \u2014 wait no, movement:\n  - From (4,2) \u2192 (4,3): so new body: (4,2), (4,1), and (5,1) \u2014 yes\n  - Then RIGHT to (5,3): fine\n\nBut note: if we go RIGHT to (5,2), then UP to (5,3), that gets us the apple in two moves.\n\nSame as UP then RIGHT.\n\nBut: is (5,3) accessible from both?\n\nYes.\n\nBut: **after moving RIGHT to (5,2)**, are we blocking anything? Not really.\n\nBut: look at **(5,2)** \u2014 is it safe to go there?\n\nWait \u2014 **(6,1)** is our **old tail**, which will be vacated when we move \u2014 so no problem.\n\nBut: could there be a conflict if another snake moves?\n\nEnemy is far away \u2014 not a concern.\n\nNow, **tiebreak**: which path keeps us safer?\n\n- UP to (4,3): moves further from own body \u2014 good\n- RIGHT to (5,2): moves toward column 5, where (5,1) is \u2014 but (5,2) is above (5,1), so only issue if we later move DOWN\n\nBut (5,1) is part of our body, so we just need to avoid moving DOWN from (5,2) \u2014 which we won\u2019t, because we\u2019ll go UP to (5,3)\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nBut: **RIGHT** gets us to a position where the next move to (5,3) is **UP**, which may be slightly better because (5,3) is above (5,2), and no obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) to (5,3) is RIGHT \u2014 also fine.\n\nBut \u2014 important: **(5,2)** is **not** currently occupied, but is it part of another snake?\n\nEnemy snake is on left edge \u2014 all at x=0.\n\nApples are at (5,3) \u2014 so no other snakes near.\n\nBut: is there a possibility that **enemy snake moves down** and starts coming around?\n\nUnlikely \u2014 they are at (0,3), moving up \u2014 body from (0,3) to (0,7), so head at (0,3), body (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) \u2014 so actually, they are moving **downward**?\n\nWait: head at (0,3), body at (0,4), so y decreases from head to body \u2014 meaning snake is moving **down**, not up.\n\nBecause (0,4) has higher y than (0,3), so if head is at (0,3) and body goes to (0,4), that means body is above head \u2014 so the snake is moving **down**.\n\nSo movement: from (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2014 so previous move was DOWN.\n\nSo they might continue down to (0,2), (0,1), etc. \u2014 toward apples at (0,2), (0,0)\n\nSo they are going after the left-side apples.\n\nNo threat to center.\n\nBack to our move.\n\nSo both UP and RIGHT are safe and lead to apple in 2 moves.\n\nBut: **RIGHT to (5,2)** has one advantage \u2014 it\u2019s **closer** to the apple in terms of alignment.\n\n(5,2) is directly below (5,3), so next move is straight up \u2014 no turn needed.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is left of (5,3) \u2014 so we\u2019d have to turn right.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nBut: **is (5,2) safer?**\n\nWait \u2014 our body is at (5,1) \u2014 so (5,2) is directly above it.\n\nAfter we move to (5,2), our body will be:\n- Head: (5,2)\n- Body: (4,2), (4,1)\n- Tail: (5,1) \u2014 but (5,1) is at (5,1), and (5,2) is above it \u2014 so our body is not connected vertically.\n\nWait: no \u2014 when we move RIGHT from (4,2) to (5,2), the new body is:\n- Leave (4,2) \u2192 so new head: (5,2)\n- Body: (4,2), (4,1)\n- And tail: (5,1) is vacated, so tail moves from (6,1) to (5,1)? No.\n\nLet\u2019s trace:\n\nBefore move:\n- Positions: (4,2) \u2014 head\n- (4,1) \u2014 body\n- (5,1) \u2014 body\n- (6,1) \u2014 tail\n\nWait \u2014 **that\u2019s a problem**.\n\nIf head is at (4,2), and body is [(4,1), (5,1)], then the segment after (5,1) must be (6,1) \u2014 so the snake is:  \n(4,2) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (6,1)\n\nIs that a valid shape?\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,1): DOWN  \n(4,1) to (5,1): RIGHT  \n(5,1) to (6,1): RIGHT\n\nSo the body goes:  \n(4,2) \u2193 to (4,1) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (6,1)\n\nBut (4,1) connects to both (4,2) above and (5,1) right \u2014 so it's a corner.\n\nBut the full path is:  \nHead (4,2) \u2014 DOWN to (4,1) \u2014 RIGHT to (5,1) \u2014 RIGHT to (6,1) \u2014 tail\n\nSo the snake forms a \"down then right\" L-shape.\n\nNow, if we move **RIGHT** to (5,2), the new head is (5,2)\n\nThen the body becomes: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTail: (6,1) vacates \u2014 so tail moves to (5,1)? No \u2014 the tail only advances if we don\u2019t grow.\n\nBut we are not eating this turn, so tail will advance \u2014 meaning (6,1) is vacated, and new tail is (5,1)? No \u2014 the snake length remains 4, but tail moves forward one.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before move: segments:\n  1. (4,2) \u2014 head\n  2. (4,1)\n  3. (5,1)\n  4. (6,1) \u2014 tail\n\nMove RIGHT to (5,2)\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n- Then the body follows: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n- Tail: (6,1) is abandoned \u2192 so (5,1) becomes the new tail segment\n\nBut (5,1) is still in the body \u2014 yes, it's now the end.\n\nNow, is (5,2) adjacent to (4,2)? Yes \u2014 from (4,2) to (5,2) is RIGHT \u2014 correct.\n\nBut: after the move, is the body connected?\n\n- (5,2) \u2192 (4,2): LEFT? But snake moves forward \u2014 the body follows the head.\n\nActually, the snake becomes:\n- Head: (5,2)\n- Then what was head: (4,2)\n- Then what was first body: (4,1)\n- Then what was second body: (5,1)\n- Tail: (5,1)\n\nSo segment order: (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (5,1)\n\nNow, is this connected?\n\n- (5,2) to (4,2): left \u2014 okay\n- (4,2) to (4,1): down \u2014 okay\n- (4,1) to (5,1): right \u2014 okay\n\nSo it\u2019s a zigzag: but valid.\n\nBut now, if we later move DOWN from (5,2), we\u2019d go to (5,1) \u2014 which is our tail \u2014 but tail will vacate when we move, so if we move DOWN, we must ensure (5,1) is not occupied.\n\nBut after move to (5,2), tail is at (5,1), so (5,1) is still occupied until the turn ends.\n\nSo moving DOWN from (5,2) on the **next** turn would be to (5,1), which at that moment **might be empty** if tail advances.\n\nBut only if we don\u2019t grow.\n\nBut we\u2019re not planning to go DOWN.\n\nWe plan to go UP to (5,3) next.\n\nSo (5,2) to (5,3): UP \u2014 no problem.\n\n(5,3) is currently an apple \u2014 so when we move there, we\u2019ll eat it and grow.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to choice: UP to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,2)?\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut: let's check if (5,2) is **closer to danger** or not.\n\nNo.\n\nBut: **UP to (4,3)** has a slightly higher chance of allowing us to see the board and react.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 is there a **blocked** path?\n\nWait \u2014 if we go to (5,2), then UP to (5,3), we eat the apple.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3) \u2192 RIGHT to (5,3).\n\nBut: suppose another snake is also going for (5,3)? None in the area.\n\nBut enemy is far.\n\nSo both paths work.\n\nBut: **RIGHT to (5,2)** aligns us **directly below** the apple, so we can go straight up \u2014 which is clean.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT keeps us more central.\n\nBut: is there a risk of self-collision later? Not immediately.\n\nAnother point: after eating at (5,3), we will grow again \u2014 so we need space to maneuver.\n\n(5,3) has neighbors:\n- (4,3): will be empty\n- (6,3): '.' \u2014 empty\n- (5,4): '.' \u2014 empty\n- (5,2): we just came from \u2014 will be vacated\n\nSo plenty of room.\n\nSo both moves are fine.\n\nBut let's go with **RIGHT to (5,2)** because:\n- It puts us directly below the apple\n- Next move is straightforward UP\n- Slightly more direct alignment\n\nAlso, moving UP to (4,3) would require a turn to the right later, while RIGHT then UP is same number of turns.\n\nBut no major difference.\n\nWait \u2014 but in the last rationale, we said:\n> Best choice: **UP \u2192 (4,2)**\n\nAnd now we\u2019re at (4,2).\n\nWe should be consistent with the plan: from (4,2), go UP to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3)\n\nThat was the stated strategy.\n\nChanging might not be better.\n\nBut is (4,3) safe? Yes.\n\n(5,2) safe? Also.\n\nBut \u2014 **(5,2)** is closer to (5,1), which is in our body \u2014 but not occupied at the destination.\n\nHowever, **no advantage** to RIGHT over UP in this case.\n\nBut let's check the **board**:\n\nIs there any apple-related urgency?\n\nApples at (5,3) \u2014 we\u2019re closest.\n\nIf we don't take it, maybe no one else will for a while.\n\nSo we can afford to approach carefully.\n\nBut both paths are safe.\n\nI recall that in snake, it's often better to **avoid moving too close to your own body**, but both (4,3) and (5,2) are one move away.\n\nAnother idea: **DOWN** is invalid (into (4,1), our body), LEFT to (3,2) is safe but not useful.\n\nSo between UP and RIGHT.\n\nBut \u2014 **RIGHT to (5,2)**: is that cell in the enemy's path? No.\n\nBut wait \u2014 let's list current occupancy at (5,2): empty, as per board.\n\nYes.\n\nBut **(5,1)** is our body, and (5,2) is directly above it \u2014 after we leave (4,2), our body is at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), with tail at (6,1)\n\nWhen we move to (5,2), we vacate (4,2), so our new body segments are:\n- (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) \u2014 still there\n- But now head at (5,2)\n\nSo (5,2) and (5,1) are vertical \u2014 no problem, as long as we don't move down next.\n\nWe won't \u2014 we'll move up.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,3) \u2014 (4,2) is directly below, our former head \u2014 but it will be vacated, so (4,3) and (4,2) are fine.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nBut to maintain consistency with the plan in the last rationale \u2014 we said:\n> From (4,2), next move can be UP to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3)\n\nSo let\u2019s follow that.\n\nIt's a clear path.\n\nAlso, moving UP keeps us on the same column, which may be smoother.\n\nSo I\u2019ll go with **UP**.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- After moving to (4,3), evaluate if (5,3) is still available and safe to reach.\n- If so, move RIGHT to (5,3) to eat the apple.\n- Watch for any snake movements that might threaten (5,3) or block access, though currently low risk.\n- Long-term, aim to control the center and expand toward other apples when safe.\n\nUP",

(empty)\n- No snake or apple\n- **Safe**, but not ideal\n- Moves me away from the (5,7) apple\n- Would take more moves to reach (5,7), requiring a later RIGHT turn\n- Not efficient\n- Only makes sense if (5,7) were unsafe, but it\u2019s not\n\n---\n\n### 4. **RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)**\n- (6,6): '.' \u2014 empty, safe\n- Could be a step toward (6,8) or (7,7) apples\n- But that's **longer path**, and (5,7) is right above me\n- Turning away from immediate gain with no threat justification\n- Suboptimal when a free apple is adjacent and safe\n\n---\n\n### Strategic Assessment:\n- The apple at **(5,7)** is **right above me** \u2014 I can eat it in one move.\n- Eating it gives me **+1 length and +1 point**\n- After eating, my body will grow: new tail remains at (5,3), and my head extends to (5,7)\n- Post-eating, I should prepare to avoid trapping myself \u2014 my tail will be stuck moving up the (5,y) column for a few turns\n\n**Next turn strategy reminder:**  \nAfter eating (5,7), I will be at (5,7) with body at (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3).  \nFrom there:\n- Avoid going back DOWN immediately (would collide with (5,6))\n- Best continuation: **RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)** to start moving toward (6,8) or (7,7)\n- (6,7) is currently empty ('.')\n- (7,7) has apple \u2014 will be 2 moves away after eating (5,7)\n- So, next turn, expect to go **RIGHT**, unless blocked\n\nNo threats are near. Enemy snake #0 is stuck near the left wall, currently at (2,0), and appears constrained along the bottom-left edge.\n\n**Decision:**  \nGo **UP** to eat the apple at (5,7) \u2014 safe, optimal, and high reward.\n\nUP",

This means my body is now:  \n**(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)** \u2014 same as before, just extended by the apple, with the head now at (5,7).\n\nApples remaining:\n- (7,7) \u2014 northeast, two steps right\n- (6,8) \u2014 north and right, one up and one right\n- (9,1) \u2014 far southeast, low priority\n- (4,1) \u2014 far southwest, low priority\n\nSo the closest valuable apples are (7,7) and (6,8). Both are relatively close and worth targeting.\n\nNow, let's evaluate my possible moves from **(5,7)**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **UP \u2192 (5,8)**\n- (5,8): check board \u2192 currently '.' (empty)\n- Not occupied by self, enemy, or wall\n- Safe move\n- But doesn't get me closer to (7,7) or (6,8)\n- (6,8) would require a later rightward move\n- Not the most efficient\n\nStill, it\u2019s safe and gives breathing room.\n\nBut let\u2019s compare.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **DOWN \u2192 (5,6)**\n- (5,6): currently occupied by my **own body segment**\n- Moving back here \u2192 **self-collision**\n- \u274c **Invalid move \u2014 would die**\n- **Do NOT choose DOWN**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LEFT \u2192 (4,7)**\n- (4,7): check board \u2192 '.' (empty), not occupied\n- Safe\n- But moves me away from both (7,7) and (6,8)\n- The apple at (4,1) is far and not worth it given competition\n- Not optimal \u2014 heading west doesn't align with apple distribution\n- Not desirable\n\n---\n\n### 4. **RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)**\n- (6,7): '.' \u2014 empty, safe\n- Gets me closer to both (7,7) and (6,8)\n- From (6,7), I can either:\n  - Go **UP to (6,8)** \u2192 eat that apple next!\n  - Or go **RIGHT to (7,7)** after that\n- This move sets up **immediate access to two apples**\n- (6,8) is just one up from (6,7), and (7,7) is one right from (6,7)\n\nMoreover, (6,8) is closer than (7,7) \u2014 so best plan:\n- Move **RIGHT** to (6,7)\n- Then **UP** to eat (6,8) apple\n\nAlso, I need to avoid getting boxed in. The enemy snake (#0) is currently stuck near the left side, moving along the bottom. No immediate threat from it.\n\nMy current body is a vertical column from (5,7) down to (5,3). After moving **RIGHT** to (6,7), my new body will be:\n- Head: (6,7)\n- Body: (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nThis keeps me moving horizontally, freeing up (5,7) for my next body segment, which avoids immediate trapping.\n\nNo self, wall, or enemy blocks this move.\n\n\u2705 **RIGHT is safe and strategically optimal**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy for next turn:\nAfter moving **RIGHT** to (6,7), I will be positioned to:\n- Go **UP to (6,8)** to eat that apple, +1 point and grow again\n- Then from (6,8), options include:\n  - **UP+RIGHT** toward (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), or (9,1) if desired\n  - Or **RIGHT** to (7,8), then down to (7,7)\n- Stay aware of tail movement \u2014 I\u2019ll have a longer body soon\n- Avoid circling without escape room\n\nNo nearby threats. Priority: **secure (6,8) apple next turn via UP**\n\n---\n\n**Verdict:**\n- UP \u2192 safe but not optimal\n- DOWN \u2192 death\n- LEFT \u2192 away from goals\n- RIGHT \u2192 best move, enables apple capture at (6,8) next\n\nRIGHT",

Its body blocks column 5 from y=3 upwards. However, since my target path involves rows 0 and 1, I can safely pass under the enemy snake (at x=5, y=1) after collecting the current apple.

No. But I should consider:\n- If I go **UP** to (6,8), then next turn I can go **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)** then **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)** to get the other apple\n- If I go **RIGHT** to (7,7), then I can go **UP \u2192 (7,8)** then **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**\n\nSo both paths allow me to get both apples \u2014 but **order matters slightly**.\n\nBut there's a spatial difference:\n\nIf I go **UP first to (6,8)**:\n- My body will be extending down through (6,7), (5,7), etc.\n- (6,7) becomes body, so I can't go back there immediately\n- But (7,7) remains free \u2014 I can then go **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)** \u2192 **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)** to eat it\n\nIf I go **RIGHT first to (7,7)**:\n- Then go **UP \u2192 (7,8)** \u2192 **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)** \u2014 also fine\n\nBut \u2014 **(6,8)** is directly above my current position \u2014 moving **UP** is more natural and keeps my body aligned vertically, giving more room.\n\nAnother consideration: **Board symmetry and escape routes.**\n\nAfter eating:\n- If I go **UP**, I'm at (6,8), surrounded by open space on 3 sides (left, right, up)\n- If I go **RIGHT**, I'm at (7,7), same\n\nNo real difference.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the apple at **(6,8)** is one step **closer in Manhattan distance**?  \nFrom (6,7):  \n- (6,8): distance = 1  \n- (7,7): distance = 1  \n\u2192 Equal.\n\nBut (6,8) is **UP**, which keeps me closer to the top \u2014 more headroom.\n\nAlso, **(7,7)** can be easily reached from (6,8) next turn \u2014 but after eating (6,8), I grow, so I must be cautious not to trap myself.\n\nHowever, the entire area is open \u2014 no danger.\n\nBut here's a key insight:  \n**After eating an apple, I grow \u2014 so I must ensure I don't box myself in.**\n\nSuppose I go **RIGHT to (7,7)**:\n- Head: (7,7)\n- Body: (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)\n- Then if I go **UP to (7,8)** \u2192 safe\n- Then **LEFT to (6,8)** \u2192 safe\n\nSuppose I go **UP to (6,8)**:\n- Head: (6,8)\n- Body: (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)\n- Then **RIGHT to (7,8)** \u2192 safe\n- Then **DOWN to (7,7)** \u2192 safe\n\nBoth are equally viable.\n\nBut \u2014 **(6,8)** is directly above current head, and my body is all to the south and west \u2014 so **UP** gives me the most open space in front.\n\nAlso, if I go **UP**, my movement is clean upward \u2014 and from (6,8), I can continue to explore upward or right freely.\n\nNo strong reason to prefer one over the other except **slight convenience**: (6,8) is orthogonally aligned up \u2014 and if I go **UP**, then next move **RIGHT**, I'm expanding into fresh territory.\n\nBut I should also consider: **which apple might be at risk**?\n\nEnemy snake #0 is far away \u2014 (4,0), stretched along bottom-left \u2014 no chance they reach (6,8) or (7,7) anytime soon. So **no competition**.\n\nTherefore, **both are safe to take \u2014 I can choose either**.\n\nBut since both are equally safe and accessible, I should pick one to avoid hesitation.\n\nLet\u2019s consider **future path efficiency**.\n\nIf I go **UP to (6,8)** first:\n- Then I can go **RIGHT to (7,8)**\n- Then **DOWN to (7,7)** \u2014 eat second apple\n- Then **DOWN to (7,6)**, etc. \u2014 clean path\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7,7)** first:\n- Then **UP to (7,8)**\n- Then **LEFT to (6,8)** \u2014 same path\n\nSo total cost is same.\n\nBut \u2014 **when I eat the first apple**, I grow, so the second apple must be reachable **without cutting off my tail**.\n\nBut since I\u2019ll be growing immediately, my tail doesn\u2019t move forward \u2014 so as long as the path is open, I can reach it.\n\nNo danger.\n\nBut one subtle difference:  \nIf I go **UP to (6,8)**, then my body is at (6,7) \u2014 which is directly below me.  \nFrom (6,8), I cannot go **DOWN** without collision.  \nBut I don\u2019t want to.\n\nFrom (6,8), I want to go **RIGHT** toward (7,8), which is open.\n\nSimilarly, if I go **RIGHT to (7,7)**, I can then go **UP** to (7,8), then **LEFT**.\n\nSame.\n\nNo advantage.\n\nBut \u2014 **(6,8)** is listed first in the apple list? Irrelevant.\n\nI could prioritize **UP** because it\u2019s the \"higher\" apple \u2014 y=8 vs y=7 \u2014 so it\u2019s more central to the top area.\n\nBut again, no strong reason.\n\nWait \u2014 look at the board:\n\nAfter I move, my **tail** will be at (5,4), and I\u2019m not close to it. So I have room.\n\nBut here\u2019s a tiebreaker: **directional consistency**.\n\nMy last move was **RIGHT**, so I\u2019m now moving horizontally. If I go **UP**, I\u2019m changing direction \u2014 but that\u2019s fine.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT again**, I go from **(5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (7,7)** \u2014 straight line.\n\nBut then I\u2019ll be at (7,7), with body at (6,7), (5,7), etc. \u2014 still a horizontal extension.\n\nBut I can\u2019t go further right indefinitely \u2014 no apples that way.\n\n(8,7), (9,7) \u2014 empty.\n\nBut (9,1) is far below \u2014 not worth it.\n\nSo extending right doesn't gain much long-term.\n\nWhereas going **UP to (6,8)** starts me moving upward \u2014 toward open space.\n\nAlso, from (6,8), I can consider going toward (8,8), (9,9), or down to (7,7) \u2014 more flexible.\n\n(7,7) will still be there \u2014 I can get it next move.\n\nBut if I go to (7,7) first, I might be less likely to go back up for (6,8)? No, I should still go.\n\nBut: **if I go to (7,7), and then want to go UP, I go to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8)** \u2014 that\u2019s fine.\n\nAlternatively, if I go **UP first**, I can still get (7,7) easily.\n\nSo truly symmetric.\n\nBut: **which apple respawns first**? Not applicable \u2014 we don\u2019t have info on respawn.\n\nSo assume they stay until taken.\n\nNo urgency.\n\nBut: **to maximize growth and control**, I should just take one \u2014 both are equal.\n\nBut I recall in prior rationale, I said: \u201cAfter moving RIGHT to (6,7), I will go UP to eat (6,8)\u201d\n\nAh! \u2014 in the **last move rationale**, I explicitly planned:  \n> After moving RIGHT to (6,7), I will be positioned to:  \n> - Go **UP to (6,8)** to eat that apple\n\nSo **I already committed to that strategy**.\n\nTo maintain consistency and avoid flipping, I should follow through.\n\nAlso, (6,8) is directly accessible \u2014 no reason to deviate.\n\nTherefore, **UP is the next logical move**.\n\nAdditionally, if I go **UP**, I occupy the higher ground \u2014 more central in y-direction \u2014 better for future expansion.\n\nFinal decision: **UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn:  \nAfter eating (6,8), I will likely move **RIGHT to (7,8)** to position for (7,7) or further exploration. I\u2019ll reassess based on board state, but will aim to get (7,7) next if still available.\n\nUP",

As a result, I grew in length. My body is now:\n\n- Head: (6, 8)\n- Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4)]\n\nThe apples are still located at:\n- (7, 7) \u2014 one **DOWN** from my current head\n- (9, 1) \u2014 far southeast\n- (1, 7) \u2014 far west\n- (0, 4) \u2014 southwest\n- (5, 8) \u2014 one **LEFT** from my current head\n\nSo, two apples are within immediate striking distance:\n1. **(7, 7)** \u2014 down-right diagonal \u2014 reachable in 2 moves: DOWN then RIGHT or RIGHT then DOWN\n2. **(5, 8)** \u2014 directly **LEFT** \u2014 just one move west\n\nBut wait \u2014 (5,8) is currently **empty** on the board? Let's check the board:\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . A 1 . . .   \u2190 y=8\n 7 . A . . . T T A . .   \u2190 y=7\n```\n\nAt (5,8): there's an 'A' \u2014 so **yes, there is an apple at (5,8)**, just one **LEFT** from my current head at (6,8).\n\nBut \u2014 is (5,8) occupied by any part of me?\n\nMy body: (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) \u2014 all at y\u22647.\n\n(5,8) is at (5,8) \u2014 same x as part of my body, but y=8, which is one above (5,7). So:\n- (5,8) is **not** part of my body\n- It's not a wall\n- No enemy snake shown near it \u2014 enemy #0 is far south-west\n\nSo (5,8) is **safe to move into**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is (5,8) accessible now?\n\nFrom (6,8), can I move **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**?  \nYes \u2014 it's adjacent, and it contains an apple.\n\nSimilarly:\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**: that's currently my first body segment \u2014 **blocked**, would cause self-collision \u2192 \u26d4\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**: '.' \u2014 empty \u2014 safe\n- **UP \u2192 (6,9)**: '.' \u2014 empty \u2014 safe\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**: 'A' \u2014 apple \u2014 safe and scores\n\nSo legal moves:\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 eats apple \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) \u2014 empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 **my body** \u2192 \u274c illegal\n\nSo **DOWN is not an option** \u2014 would collide with myself.\n\nNow, evaluate the choices:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**\n- Eats an apple \u2192 grow again \u2192 +1 point\n- My tail will stay at (5,4) for now (since I grow)\n- After move: head at (5,8), body: (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)\n- From (5,8), next options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,8): '.' \u2014 safe\n  - UP \u2192 (5,9): '.' \u2014 safe\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,7): will be body \u2014 occupied \u2192 dangerous later\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,8): will be body \u2014 but I just came from there\n\nBut since I grow, (6,8) becomes body \u2014 so I must not trap myself.\n\nStill, after eating, I\u2019ll have more length, but (5,8) opens up left and up \u2014 good escape.\n\nAlso: **this apple might not be taken by enemy soon** \u2014 enemy #0 is at bottom left and busy \u2014 but still, (5,8) is very close to their territory? Their head is at (4,1), so not a threat.\n\nBut (5,8) is one move away \u2014 **if I don\u2019t take it now, I might not get another chance**.\n\nAlso, **I can only move once \u2014 so if I pass now, I risk leaving it for later, but I might not be able to come back**.\n\nBut \u2014 is there any reason **not** to take it?\n\nOnly if it leads to a trap.\n\nBut (5,8) is open, and after eating, I can go **UP to (5,9)** or **LEFT to (4,8)** \u2014 both open.\n\nSo **highly favorable**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**\n- No apple \u2014 but positions me to go **DOWN to (7,7)** next turn to eat that apple\n- So I delay gratification \u2014 two moves to get (7,7): RIGHT \u2192 DOWN\n- But (7,7) is currently an apple \u2014 I can get it in two steps if I go this route\n- But \u2014 by going RIGHT first, I pass up the chance to eat (5,8) **now**\n\nBut (5,8) will still be there? Only if no one else takes it \u2014 but no enemy is near, so likely yes.\n\nBut \u2014 after I move RIGHT, I'm at (7,8), then next move I can go DOWN to (7,7) to eat apple.\n\nBut then I still haven\u2019t eaten (5,8) \u2014 and now I'm farther from it.\n\nSo by not taking (5,8) now, I may lose easy access.\n\nAlso, why leave a free apple one move away?\n\n---\n\n### 3. **UP \u2192 (6,9)**\n- Empty \u2014 no apple\n- Just moving up \u2014 delays any apple consumption\n- From there, I can go LEFT or RIGHT later\n- But no immediate benefit\n- Wastes a turn\n\nNot optimal.\n\n---\n\nSo the **best immediate move is LEFT to (5,8)** to eat the apple.\n\nIt gives me:\n- Another point\n- Growth\n- Keeps me in the upper-mid board\n- Positions me to explore left or up next\n\nAdditionally, after eating (5,8), I can consider:\n- Going **LEFT to (4,8)** \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 etc., toward (1,7) apple\n- Or **UP to (5,9)**, then (6,9), etc., to explore top row\n\nMeanwhile, the (7,7) apple is still available \u2014 but I can go for that later if needed, though it\u2019s now **not immediately reachable** since I\u2019m at (6,8) \u2014 would require (6,8) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (7,7), but after I grow, path stays open.\n\nBut **(5,8) is closer and currently adjacent**, and I should **prioritize taking apples when they\u2019re right next to me**.\n\nAlso, if I don\u2019t take (5,8) now, and later the enemy or I block it, I miss it.\n\nNo downside to taking it.\n\nFinal decision: **LEFT**\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After eating (5,8), I will be at (5,8) with a longer body. I\u2019ll assess whether to go **UP to (5,9)** to explore or **LEFT to (4,8)** toward the (1,7) apple. I may also keep an eye on (7,7) \u2014 but it\u2019s now farther, so lower priority unless no other apples are accessible.\n\nLEFT",

T T A . .\n```\n\nx=5 and x=6 at y=7 are both 'T' \u2192 (5,7) and (6,7) \u2014 both are **my body** \u2014 yes, correct\n\nSo (4,7) is shown as '.' \u2014 no 'T' at x=4,y=7 \u2014 so (4,7) is open\n\nWait, let's parse the board clearly:\n\nRow y=7:\nx=0: '.'  \nx=1: 'A'  \nx=2: '.'  \nx=3: '.'  \nx=4: '.'  \nx=5: 'T'  \nx=6: 'T'  \nx=7: 'A'  \nx=8: '.'  \nx=9: '.'\n\nSo (4,7) is **empty** \u2014 yes.\n\nSo from (4,8), I could go:\n- (4,8) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (1,7) \u2014 all likely open\n\n(1,7) has an apple \u2014 and it's isolated \u2014 low risk\n\nSo moving **LEFT** aligns with good forward progress\n\nUP is safe but directionless \u2014 no apple in that direction\n\nSo **LEFT is better**\n\nAlso, by moving LEFT, I keep options open to later come down right side for (7,7) if needed \u2014 but (7,7) might be taken by enemy? Unlikely \u2014 enemy is far south\n\nEnemy head at (5,1) \u2014 far from (7,7)\n\nSo both apples (7,7) and (1,7) are accessible, but (1,7) is in less contested area\n\nAlso, I am now anchored on x=5 column from y=4 to y=8 \u2014 so **I must not go DOWN** \u2014 it's filled.\n\nSo I need to leave this column safely.\n\nLeaving via **LEFT (4,8)** is best \u2014 avoids self-collision\n\nUP is okay, but then I have to come back down \u2014 may trap myself in corner\n\nSo: **LEFT \u2192 (4,8)** is optimal\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After moving to (4,8), evaluate whether to continue LEFT toward (3,8) or go DOWN to (4,7). Watch for body position \u2014 avoid (5,7), (5,6), etc. Aim to reach (1,7) apple in several moves. Monitor if any snake moves closer, but currently enemy is far away, so safe to pursue.\n\nLEFT",

This allows me to exit UP towards the open space in the top-right corner and the next apple at (7, 7).\n2.  **Path B (RIGHT first):** Move to (9, 2), then (9, 1). After eating at (9, 1), my body occupies (9, 2). The square (9, 2) is blocked by my own body (neck). The only exits from (9, 1) would be to (8, 1) or (9, 0). Moving to (8, 1) forces me further down to (8, 0) because (7, 1) and (8, 2) are blocked. This path forces me into the bottom row (y=0), restricting mobility.\n\nPath A provides better future mobility (an exit UP). The square (8, 1) is currently empty and safe.\n\nStrategy: Move DOWN to (8, 1), then RIGHT to (9, 1) to collect the apple, then look to move UP towards (7, 7).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Two moves from now, I can eat and grow, gaining a point. After eating (1,7), I will reassess the board \u2014 possibly consider (7,7) if my body has cleared a path, or evaluate (0,4)/(0,3) if they become accessible and low-risk.\n\n### Strategy note for next turn:\nAfter moving to (2,7), check if (1,7) is still free and unthreatened \u2014 if so, move **LEFT** again to eat. After eating, **do not blindly continue** \u2014 be aware that my body will now stretch farther, and I must avoid turning into myself, especially when deciding whether to go down toward left-edge apples or reposition for (7,7).
