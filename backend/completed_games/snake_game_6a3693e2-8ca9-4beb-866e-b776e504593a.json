The goal is to collect apples and avoid collisions.\n\nLooking at the board, apples are at (3,6), (9,0), (2,3), (8,6), (2,4). Hmm. The snake is currently facing right, so the next possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT again. But wait, the last move was RIGHT, so moving LEFT now would reverse direction. But rule 2 says you die if you go backwards. So after moving RIGHT last time, moving LEFT now would be moving back, which is not allowed. So possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT again.\n\nLooking at the snake's current position (2,2). If it moves RIGHT again to (3,2), is there anything there? The board shows at (3,2), is there a snake or apple? The apples are at (3,6), (9,0), (2,3), (8,6), (2,4). So (3,2) is empty. So moving right again would take it to (3,2). That's safe for now.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,3). Wait, (2,3) is an apple! So if the snake moves UP now, it would land on (2,3), which is one of the apples. That would be good because it would grow. But wait, the current direction is RIGHT. Moving UP would be a change in direction. But since the last move was RIGHT, moving UP is allowed as per the rules. Because rule 2 only prohibits moving backwards, which is LEFT in this case. So moving UP or DOWN or RIGHT again is allowed.\n\nIf the snake moves UP to (2,3), that's an apple. So that's a good move. But the next step after that would be important. Alternatively, moving right to (3,2) and then maybe up or another direction. Let's check the other apples. There's an apple at (2,4), which is two steps up from current position. So moving UP once would get to (2,3), then another UP would get to (2,4) for another apple. That could be a good path.\n\nBut if the snake moves up once",
