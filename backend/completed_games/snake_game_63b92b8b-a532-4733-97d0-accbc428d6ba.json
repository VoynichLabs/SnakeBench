The remaining apples are at (9,1), (0,6), (2,2), (6,0), and (9,7). The enemy snake is still positioned at (8,7) with its body at (8,8) and (8,9).\n\nFrom our current head location (8,4) our safe moves are:\n\u2022 UP goes to (8,5) \u2013 clear and on the board.\n\u2022 RIGHT goes to (9,4) \u2013 clear and on the board.\n\u2022 DOWN goes to (8,3) \u2013 clear.\n\u2022 LEFT goes to (7,4) \u2013 that's our own body, so not allowed.\n\nLooking at apple options, the closest ones by Manhattan distance are the ones at (9,1) and (9,7) (both 4 moves away). However, heading directly toward (9,7) might bring us nearer to the enemy snake (currently at (8,7)). A more cautious strategy could be to start by moving RIGHT to (9,4), which is a safe, unobstructed square. From (9,4) we could later choose to either maneuver upward toward (9,7) or change our route to aim for (9,1), depending on opponent movements and board dynamics.\n\nThus, to keep things safe while maintaining flexibility in target apples, I decide that the next move from (8,4) should be RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
