(RIGHT would hit the wall.)\n• Moving LEFT to (8,2) brings us closer to (7,3) by reducing the x-gap.\n• (8,2) is an empty cell with no immediate danger from enemy snake (Snake #2 is far at (0,2)), and it's within bounds.\n• On the next turns we can continue moving toward (7,3) effectively.\n\nThus, the strategy is:\n1. Move LEFT to approach apple (7,3).\n2. Follow up with either UP or LEFT on subsequent moves to reach the apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT",

The enemy Snake #1 is at (9, 2) with no body segments.\n\nGiven the information, I have a few options to consider:\n\n1. I could move up to (0, 3) to get closer to the apple at (0, 7). This would allow me to potentially reach that apple next turn.\n2. I could move left to (0, 1) to avoid the enemy snake and potentially get closer to the apple at (1, 5) or (5, 5).\n3. I could stay put at (0, 2) and wait for a better opportunity to move.\n\nConsidering the risk of running into the enemy snake or a wall, I think the safest option would be to move left to (0, 1). This will put some distance between me and the enemy snake, and I'll be in a better position to go for one of the nearby apples on my next turn.\n\nMy decided next move is: LEFT.",
