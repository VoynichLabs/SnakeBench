This is where my body segment is located\n- RIGHT to (2, 7) - Valid, open space\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 0) with body at [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. They're right next to the apple cluster at the bottom and could easily grab (2, 0) or (1, 0) on their next move.\n\nStrategy analysis:\n1. There's an apple at (2, 8) that's very close - just UP and RIGHT from my current position\n2. The enemy snake is perfectly positioned to grab the bottom apples (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n3. The apple at (5, 6) is in the middle area and relatively safe for now\n4. The apple at (8, 2) is far away but uncontested\n\nI think my best move is UP to (1, 8). This gets me closer to the apple at (2, 8) which I can grab on the next turn by moving RIGHT. This is much more efficient than trying to race the enemy snake to the bottom apples, which they're likely to get anyway given their position.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, move RIGHT to (2, 8) to collect that apple, then reassess whether to go for the middle apple at (5, 6) or try to contest other apples.\n\nUP"

Looking more carefully, perhaps there's a miscounting in the body segments.\n\nLet me try LEFT to (3, 7) and hope the enemy snake moves in a way that frees up that space, though it looks like enemy body is there.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If I survive this move, I need to find a way to break out of this enclosed area and head toward the apples in the lower part of the board.\n\nLEFT"
