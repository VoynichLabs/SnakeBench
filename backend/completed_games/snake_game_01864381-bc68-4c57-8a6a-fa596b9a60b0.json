Distance 8 from enemy. This is my closest and safest target.\n2.  **Apple at (7, 4)**: Distance 4 from me. Distance 3 from enemy (|7-7| + |4-1|). The enemy is closer to this apple and will likely take it.\n3.  **Apple at (4, 9)**: Distance 4 from me. Distance 11 from enemy. This is a good secondary target for me.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\nMy best move is to head towards the apple at (5, 7).\n-   **UP (to 4, 6)**: Reduces distance to (5, 7) to 2 steps. Also reduces distance to (4, 9) to 3 steps. This aligns my head with column 4, allowing me to potentially choose between going right to (5, 7) or continuing straight to (4, 9) in future turns.\n-   **RIGHT (to 5, 5)**: Reduces distance to (5, 7) to 2 steps. Increases distance to (4, 9) to 5 steps. This commits me more strongly to the right side, which is slightly closer to the enemy's likely territory, and makes the secondary apple at (4, 9) harder to reach.\n-   **DOWN/LEFT**: Move away from the closest apple.\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving UP is superior because it maintains flexibility. By moving to (4, 6), then (4, 7), I can choose on turn 2 to either go RIGHT to take the apple at (5, 7) or continue UP if the situation changes. Both UP and RIGHT get me closer to the primary target, but UP keeps the secondary target (4, 9) very accessible. The enemy is far enough away that there is no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move UP to (4, 6), then likely UP to (4, 7), and then RIGHT to (5, 7) to collect the apple. This path takes 3 turns. The enemy will likely take the apple at (7, 4) in 3 turns. We will both essentially trade the closest apples to our starting positions without conflict.\n\nUP",
