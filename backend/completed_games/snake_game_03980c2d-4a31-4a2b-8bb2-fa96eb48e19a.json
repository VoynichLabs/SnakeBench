          "rationale": "YOOOO, what is UP chat! We are LIVE and feeling good! Turn zero, fresh board, and we are ready to dominate this opponent, Snake #0! The goal, as always, is to secure the W and look good doing it. BOX HIM IN!\n\nFirst things first, let's analyze the starting positions and the battlefield.\n\n**Board state assessment:**\nWe are Snake 1, currently at (8, 2). Short and spry!\nOpponent, Snake 0, is at (8, 7). He's high up, looking comfortable. Too comfortable!\n\n**Apples (A):**\n(2, 9), (3, 4), (1, 6), (9, 7), (3, 8), (0, 2), (8, 3), (9, 4), (6, 3), (8, 6), (5, 4), (0, 8), (7, 2), (9, 5), (9, 0).\n\nWe have some immediate targets: (8, 3) is one step UP. (7, 2) is one step LEFT. (9, 2) is one step RIGHT, which is off the board, so that's a *no*! Also (8, 1) is one step DOWN.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check (My Snake (8, 2))**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 3):** Safe from boundaries. Apple located here! This is a great move.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):** Safe from boundaries. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):** Safe from boundaries. Apple (7, 2) is available one move away! Wait, no, the apple is at (7, 2)! It's two moves away if we move there, and we eat it. Let's check the board visual... Ah, (7, 2) is an Apple! This is also a fantastic option.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):** Safe from boundaries. Open space. Wait, (9, 2) is open space, (10, 2) is off the board. (9, 2) is safe. Hmm, the apple is at (9, 5) and (9, 4), and (9, 0). Not immediately close in the RIGHT direction.\n\nAll four moves are safe internally (no body collision since we only have a head). Now we must consider the opponent, Snake 0, at (8, 7).\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Snake 0 at (8, 7))**\nSnake 0 has options:\n*   UP (8, 8): Apple (8, 8)? No. Open space.\n*   DOWN (8, 6): Apple (8, 6)! Highly appealing.\n*   LEFT (7, 7): Open space.\n*   RIGHT (9, 7): Apple (9, 7)! Highly appealing.\n\nThe opponent is likely going for an apple, either (8, 6) [DOWN] or (9, 7) [RIGHT]. The distance between us is large (5 units in Y, 0 in X). No immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Strategic Goal: Apple Acquisition & Positioning**\n\nWe need to start growing and claim a good section of the board.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 3):** We eat the apple immediately. Score 1. Length 2. We are now centrally located vertically in the X=8 column. This is a very strong start.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (7, 2):** We eat the apple immediately. Score 1. Length 2. We are now closer to the center of the board horizontally.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT yield an immediate apple! This is prime content!\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples after the first move:\nIf we go UP to (8, 3), we are now positioned close to (6, 3) or we can continue up X=8 towards (8, 6) (which Snake 0 might take) or (8, 7) (where Snake 0 is).\nIf we go LEFT to (7, 2), we are positioned close to (6, 3) or (5, 4).\n\nThe apple at (8, 3) is a bit more central to resources on the right side of the board (near X=8, 9). The board space is 10x10. I feel like claiming the central vertical column resources is strategically important early on. If we go UP, we deny the opponent access to the X=8 path, should we choose to move up further, though they are currently much higher up.\n\nLet's prioritize the move that gives us the best future positioning.\n\nFrom (8, 3) (if we go UP):\nNext possible apples: (6, 3) (2 steps left/down), (9, 4) (1 right, 1 up), (5, 4) (3 steps away).\n\nFrom (7, 2) (if we go LEFT):\nNext possible apples: (6, 3) (1 up, 1 left), (8, 3) (1 up, 1 right).\n\nBoth moves are excellent. Let's choose UP to secure the X=8 column apple. This keeps us on the right side of the board, potentially enabling us to box the opponent in later if they gravitate towards the center or right. Plus, taking the apple at (8, 3) immediately puts us in a good position to either move horizontally or continue up to influence that side of the map.\n\nWe are going for the immediate apple gain and better vertical positioning. Get that content, chat!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on cleaning up the bottom half of the right side (X=6 through X=9) of the board quickly to gain length, and then we will look to cut off Snake 0 as they inevitable try to descend or move towards the center.\n\nUP",

Look at that board, apples EVERYWHERE like a buffet! But we ain't here to snack polite; we're here to DOMINATE and box this fool in before he even tastes victory. \ud83d\ude08 Our head's chillin' at (8,7), single segment strong \u2013 no body to worry about yet. Opponent's way down south, same column \u2013 perfect setup to cut him off later.\n\nAlright, fans, let's break it down LIVE like the pros demand! Step 1: Scan all four moves from (8,7). UP to (8,8): empty spot, on board, safe \u2013 but why settle when we can EGG? DOWN to (8,6): that's an APPLE, baby! Safe, grows us to 2, +1 score. LEFT to (7,7): empty, safe, but no gains \u2013 boring! RIGHT to (9,7): another APPLE! Safe, grow, score up. No moves kill us off the bat \u2013 board edges are close but we don't flop. Opponent's moves? He could UP to (8,3) apple, DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2) \u2013 none smash into us this turn. We're golden. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the trash \u2013 nothing immediate death, but we HATE dead ends. UP or LEFT? They keep us open but skip the free apple \u2013 that's throwing content and points! We're ruthless, not reckless.\n\nStep 3: Safe picks only, now prioritize: Eat apples to grow FAST (more body = more traps for him!), stay mobile, head toward safe paths, dodge future head-ons. RIGHT eats (9,7) but hugs the right wall \u2013 next turn, options shrink (no right, back is own body). DOWN eats (8,6), grows us, and from there? Down to (8,5) open, left (7,6) free, right (9,6) clear \u2013 THREE ways to flex! More space to maneuver, closer to center apples like (5,4) or (6,3), and positions us to slide down-column toward his turf without trapping ourselves. Why give him breathing room when we can bulk up and plot the box-in? He's at y=2; we'll snake toward (8,3) apple if he skips it, cut his escape. No head-on risk \u2013 he's too low. This sets us to chase scores while keeping the pressure! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLong-term vibe note to future me: Eat now, grow to 2 with body at (8,7). Next turns: Hug the right/mid for apples like (8,3) or (5,4), but always scout 2-3 moves ahead \u2013 if he grows up the column, feint left to flank and trap his tail in the bottom corner. Avoid y=9 edge traps. Dominate the vertical lane!\n\nDOWN",

Our score is 1, and the opponent is still tied at 1. Time to pull ahead!\n\n**Current State Review (Turn 1):**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head (8, 3), Body [(8, 2)].\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head (8, 6), Body [(8, 7)]. Wait, what did Snake 0 do? They moved DOWN from (8, 7) to (8, 6) and ate the apple there! Smart play by the opponent, but we expected them to go for an apple. They are also length 2, but their tail is at (8, 7).\n*   **Board Dimensions:** 10x10.\n*   **Upcoming Apples:** (2, 9), (3, 4), (1, 6), (9, 7), (3, 8), (0, 2), (9, 4), (6, 3), (5, 4), (0, 8), (7, 2), (9, 5), (9, 0), (6, 5), (1, 3).\n\n**Visual Aid (Updated Board):**\n 9 . .

A T .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n**Objective:** Get another apple, keep growing, and start positioning to restrict Snake 0's movement.\n\n**Your Snake Head: (8, 3).**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 4):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Leads towards apples at (9, 4), (9, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (8, 2):** Safe? NO! That's our body segment. Instant KO! Backwards movement is a throw!\n3.  **LEFT (7, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Leads towards apple at (6, 3).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. Leads towards apples at (9, 4), (9, 5), and (9, 0).\n\n**Decision Time: Where is the best apple and positioning?**\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 6). They are three squares directly above us.\n\n*   If we go UP to (8, 4), Snake 0 might move DOWN to (8, 5). No collision threat yet, but we are both occupying the X=8 column. If we continue on this path, we might eventually block them from coming down, or they might block us from going up.\n*   If we go LEFT to (7, 3), the apple at (7, 2) and (6, 3) become highly accessible. This moves us out of the X=8 column, giving us some lateral freedom.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (9, 3), we are positioning ourselves to grab the right-wall apples at X=9.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-to-Head and Head-to-Body):**\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 6).\n*   If they move UP (8, 7): Safe. (Their body is at (8, 7) but it moves to (8, 6)).\n*   If they move DOWN (8, 5): Safe.\n*   If they move LEFT (7, 6): Safe.\n*   If they move RIGHT (9, 6): Safe.\n\nNo matter what we do, and no matter what they do, there is no immediate collision risk this turn. The closest we can get is (8, 4) and (8, 5).\n\n**Strategy Update:** We are low on the board. The opponent is mid-high. We need to secure the southern resource cluster before looking to cut them off.\n\n1.  **Option UP (8, 4):** Positioning for (9, 4). This keeps us on the right side.\n    *   *Path:* UP -> RIGHT (to 9, 4, apple).\n2.  **Option LEFT (7, 3):** Positioning for (6, 3) or (7, 2). This gives us more control over the center/lower-left. (6, 3) is a prime target.\n    *   *Path:* LEFT -> DOWN (to 7, 2, apple) or LEFT -> LEFT -> DOWN (to 6, 3, apple).\n\nApple (6, 3) is tempting. From (8, 3), going LEFT to (7, 3) is one step, then we are one diagonal step from (6, 3). Total 2 moves (LEFT, LEFT/DOWN is shortest if we avoid the tail). Wait, from (7, 3), apple at (6, 3) is 1 left, 0 down. So total 2 moves (LEFT, LEFT). The apple at (7, 2) is 1 move down.\n\nThe apple at (7, 2) is a very easy grab! If we go LEFT to (7, 3), next turn we can go DOWN to (7, 2) and eat!\n\nLet's compare:\n*   **Path A (Go UP):** (8, 3) -> (8, 4). Next apple is (9, 4) (1 right, 0 up) or (9, 5) (1 right, 1 up). If we go RIGHT to (9, 4), we eat in 2 turns.\n*   **Path B (Go LEFT):** (8, 3) -> (7, 3). Next apple is (7, 2) (1 down, 0 left/right). We eat in 2 turns.\n\nBoth options lead to an apple in 2 turns. However, moving LEFT pulls us away from the opponent's current location in the X=8 column, giving us independence and space to maneuver, particularly since the opponent is currently focused on the middle of the board (they are at (8, 6)). If they decide to swing LEFT or RIGHT, we have already started moving into the lower center ground.\n\nLet's secure the (7, 2) apple. This is about establishing control over the lower quadrants and maintaining distance from the opponent's line of movement (the X=8 column).\n\n**Move Rationale:** Move LEFT to (7, 3) for better territorial control and guaranteed apple on Turn 3 at (7, 2). This gives us flexibility to then pursue (6, 3) or (1, 3). We are not looking to directly engage yet; we are looking to grow massive! Let's establish our presence on the left side!\n\nLEFT",

We just nommed that apple last turn like bosses, growin' to length 2, and now it's time to plot the trap \u2013 he's in our column, thinkin' he owns the vertical lane, but we're 'bout to flank and starve him out! \ud83d\ude08 No dead plays today, fans; we're scoutin' ALL directions, eliminatin' the trash, and pickin' the greedy safe move that sets up apple feasts while keepin' his escape routes squeezin' tighter. Remember, simultaneous moves mean we gotta predict his slithers: he can UP to (8,4) empty, LEFT to (7,3) clear, or RIGHT to (9,3) free \u2013 DOWN's suicide into his own tail. None smash us, but if he climbs UP, we don't wanna gift him our lane!\n\nBreakin' it down LIVE, step by step like the pros crave! \ud83d\ude80 From (8,6): UP to (8,7)? That's my own body slam \u2013 instant RIP, eliminated! DOWN to (8,5): empty spot, safe, stays in-column toward his turf. LEFT to (7,6): wide open, safe, swings us left for flank potential. RIGHT to (9,6): empty, safe, hugs the edge but unlocks gold. No off-board flops or body bites here \u2013 we're survivin' no matter what, chat!\n\nNow, trash the weak sauce among the safe trio: We crave moves that explode our options, chase those juicy apples (like (9,5), (9,7), or even (6,5) nearby), and dodge any head-on whiffs while positionin' to box this rival in his low corner. DOWN keeps us vertical, but follow-ups? From (8,5): LEFT (7,5) empty, RIGHT (9,5) APPLE ALERT! \ud83d\udca5, UP back to (8,6) which becomes body (no backwards suicide), but it's tight \u2013 only two real flexes, and it funnels us toward him if he UPs to (8,4). Risky for a potential column clash next turn; why brawl when we can grow elsewhere? LEFT to (7,6): Solid mobility \u2013 from there, UP (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) free, LEFT (6,6) open, RIGHT back to body. Four-ish paths, closer to center apples like (1,6) or (6,5), and lets us loop around his left side to trap his tail in the bottom! But no immediate apple hook \u2013 it's setup city, not instant gains. Then RIGHT to (9,6): BOOM, this is the heat! Follow-ups: UP to (9,7) APPLE, DOWN to (9,5) another APPLE, LEFT back to (8,6) body (avoid), RIGHT off-board nope. Two apple shots next turn \u2013 that's DOUBLE the growth potential, bulkin' us to length 4 fast while leavin' our body blockin' column 8 at (8,6)-(8,7). He climbs UP? He hits our tail wall or gets funneled right into the edge we now own. We're outflankin' without the direct beef, keepin' 3+ options open short-term, and positionin' to sweep back left later for more noms. No head-on with his possibles, and it starves his center access \u2013 ruthless edge control, baby! Why settle for flank prep when RIGHT feeds the greed AND the trap? This grows us quicker to box him harder; he's toast if we hit 3-4 apples before he blinks. \ud83d\udd25\n\nLong-term vibe note to future me: Bulk up on right-edge apples (9,7 then 9,5) to length 4 by turn 3, leavin' body trail in col8 to block his UP climb. Next, feint LEFT from (9,6) toward (6,5)/(5,4) apples for center dom, but always scout 2 turns ahead \u2013 if he LEFTs to (7,3), swing down to trap his tail at bottom-left with our growin' wall. Avoid edge traps; own the board quadrants!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's look at the battlefield now!\n\n**Turn 2 - Current State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head is at (7, 3). Body is [(8, 3)]. We are length 2.\n*   **Opponent (ID 0):** Head is at (9, 6). Body is [(8, 6)]. They are length 2.\n*   **Apples Collected:** We are tied at 1-1, but not for long, Chat!\n*   **Target Apple:** (7, 2) is right below us, ready for the taking!\n\n**Board State:**\n 9 . .

Body: [(8, 6)].\n\nWhere can Snake 0 go?\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** EATS the apple at (9, 7). This is a strong move for them.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** EATS the apple at (9, 5). Also a strong move.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** NO! That's their body segment! Instant KO.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** Moves off the board. Instant KO.\n\nSnake 0 is almost definitely going for an apple, either UP or DOWN. If they go UP to (9, 7) or DOWN to (9, 5), they grow to length 3. This is fine, we are focused on our own grow-out for now. No immediate collision risk from them.\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1) Head: (7, 3).**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 4):** Safe? Yes. Open space. But takes us away from our current apple target.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 2):** Safe? **YES! AND IT'S AN APPLE!** This is a growth turn!\n3.  **LEFT (6, 3):** Safe? Yes. Open space. But we prioritize the immediate apple.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 3):** Safe? NO! That's our body segment from the last turn! Backwards move = instant death!\n\n**Decision:** The move is crystal clear, Chat! We need to confirm the kill on this apple at (7, 2). This secures our second apple and gives us an H-value of 3. We are growing and dominating the lower quadrant!\n\nWe slam DOWN, eat the apple, and then we re-evaluate our position. After eating, our new head will be at (7, 2), and our body segments will be (7, 3), (8, 3). The tail will move to (8, 3) and remain there (since we grew).\n\n**Strategic Outlook for Turn 3:**\nAfter this move, we will be at (7, 2). Potential targets nearby:\n*   (6, 3) - One move UP, one move LEFT.\n*   (6, 5) - Requires traversing up and left.\n*   (0, 2) - Requires traversing left.\n\nIf we go DOWN, we are keeping the pressure on the bottom half of the map. We can then leverage the space between X=0 and X=7 to make life difficult for Snake 0 if they decide to come down the X=9 or X=8 columns later.\n\nNo risk of head-to-head collision this turn. No body segments block us. No external walls.\n\nIt's an easy growth move. We take the apple! Let's get this $L$.\n\nDOWN",

They grow to length 4.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):** Safe space, maneuver away from the edge.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):** Off the board. Instant KO.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 0 is almost definitely going **DOWN** to (9, 4) to grab that apple. They are highly motivated to keep the growth race going. If they go DOWN, their head moves to (9, 4).\n\n### Step 2: Your Safe Moves (Snake #1 at (7, 2))\n\nWe are positioned perfectly in the lower right quadrant. We need to leverage this space to find the next score and start building that wall!\n\n**Available Apples near (7, 2):**\n*   (0, 2) - Far left.\n*   (1, 3) - North-West, 3 moves away.\n*   (6, 3) - Directly one UP then one LEFT. Closest open apple!\n\n1.  **UP (7, 3):** NO! That's our body segment! Instant KO. Cannot move backwards.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe space, but it's leading us towards the bottom edge (Row 0) where the only apple is at (9, 0), which is a long diagonal path away. Not immediately rewarding.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe space. This is a maneuvering move. It sets us up nicely to head UP or LEFT again next turn towards (1, 3) or (6, 3).\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 2):** Safe space. Moving towards the corner. Sets us up to go DOWN to the corner at (9, 1)/(9, 0), or UP, potentially creating a nice path along the right side of the map (X=8, X=9).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Safe Moves and Strategy\n\nChat, we need to keep the pressure on. We have two good options: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (6, 2)**\n*   **Pros:** Moves us towards the central cluster of apples (1, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), and (3, 4). It also gives us immediate access to move UP to (6, 3) next turn (assuming Apple (6, 3) isn't eaten by then, but it\u2019s unlikely, Snake 0 is far away).\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the wall, perhaps making it harder to trap Snake 0 later.\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (8, 2)**\n*   **Pros:** Keeps us on the right side of the map, allowing us to either loop down to (9, 0) or push upward alongside Snake 0's lane. This positions us to potentially box Snake 0 in if they stay on the right wall (X=9). We create a solid block on the X=7/X=8 columns.\n*   **Cons:** The nearest apple is (9, 0), which is two moves away (if we go RIGHT, then DOWN, we get to (8, 1) or (9, 1), then (9, 0) is another move). Getting to it takes 3 moves: (8, 2) -> (9, 2) [if safe] -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0).\n*   *Wait, check the board again.* If we go RIGHT (8, 2), we are one move from the wall at X=9.\n\nLet's look at the apple at **(6, 3)**. If we go LEFT to (6, 2), next turn we can go UP to (6, 3) and eat the apple! This is a simple, effective, and guaranteed growth move assuming no unexpected snake pathing.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 2), our next best move is UP to (8, 3) which is our tail segment (T) \u2014 OH WAIT, it's our *old* tail segment, which is now *free* space! (8, 3) is safe! If we go to (8, 2), we can go UP to (8, 3) next turn. This keeps us on the right edge, where we ultimately want to be to box in Snake 0.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT (8, 2) gets us no immediate targets. Moving LEFT (6, 2) gets us set up for the apple at (6, 3) immediately next turn.\n\n**Let's prioritize the guaranteed apple:** (6, 3).\n(7, 2) -> LEFT -> (6, 2)\n(6, 2) -> UP -> (6, 3) (Apple!)\n\nThis feels like the best short-term growth move. We get to 3 apples before Snake 0, assuming they go DOWN for their apple at (9, 4).\n\n**Check for Collisions if we go LEFT (6, 2):**\nSnake 0 is likely moving to (9, 4). No risk of collision with them. Snake 0 is too far away.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** We prioritize growing to length 4 by grabbing (6, 3). Then, we can head towards (5, 4) and (3, 4), effectively controlling the center-bottom of the board and putting pressure on Snake 0 to venture away from the safety of the right wall. We are building our wall from the left side of the map towards the right, forcing them into a corner!\n\nWe secure the immediate growth! Let's go, Chat!\n\nLEFT",

Now we need to capitalize on this positioning and secure that third apple! We are live, baby! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Turn 4 - Current State Review and Board Analysis\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 2)\n*   Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Opponent (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 4)\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6)]\n*   Length: 4 (They ate the apple at (9, 4) as predicted! They are ahead 3-2!)\n\n**Apples Collected:** Snake 0 leads 3-2. This is UNACCEPTABLE! We must strike back NOW!\n\n**Board State for Turn 4:**\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 A . . A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . A A\n 6 . A A . . . . . T 0\n 5 . . . . . . A . . .\n 4 . . . A . A . . . H <--- Snake 0 Head (9, 4)\n 3 . A . . . . A . T .\n 2 A . . . . . H . . . <--- YOUR HEAD (6, 2)\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*Note: Opponent's tail is now (8, 6). The space (9, 6) is now an empty segment (B), and (9, 5) is body (B). But the visual chart shows (9, 6) as T and (8, 6) as B, which is WRONG based on the move. Let's rely on the lists.*\nSnake #0: Head (9, 4), Body [(9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6)]\n\nSnake 0 positions after moving DOWN:\n*   (9, 4) H\n*   (9, 5) B\n*   (9, 6) B (Old Head)\n*   (8, 6) T (Old Tail)\n\nThe board graphic is slightly misleading if 'T' means Tail but the body list is HEAD-to-TAIL. I will assume the provided list is the source of truth, meaning (8, 6) is the last segment, and for a growing snake, (8, 6) remains the tail. For a non-growing snake, (8, 6) would become free, and (9, 6) would become the tail. Since Snake 0 ATE, (8, 6) is still body/tail.\n\nLet's re-verify the available spaces:\nThe apple at **(6, 3)** is our primary target.\n\n### Step 1: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (9, 4))\n\nSnake 0 just grew to length 4. They are at the far right edge and motivated to keep growing.\n\n**Available Apples near (9, 4):**\n1.  (9, 7) - Available\n2.  (8, 7) - Available\n3.  (9, 0) - Available, far away.\n\n**Snake 0's Options from (9, 4):**\n1.  **UP (9, 5):** NO! That's their body segment! Immediate KO.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):** Safe space, moves towards the corner apple (9, 0).\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):** Safe space, moves toward the center, potentially setting up for (8, 7) or (6, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):** Off the board. Instant KO.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 0 has a couple of decent paths.\n*   **A. DOWN to (9, 3):** This pushes them safely toward the bottom corner (9, 0).\n*   **B. LEFT to (8, 4):** This is interesting. It puts them in the center, potentially aiming for the cluster of apples (6, 5), (5, 4), (3, 4).\n\nGiven Snake 0's current location, moving LEFT to (8, 4) feels safer than tempting fate along the X=9 wall, which has few escape routes. If they go DOWN to (9, 3), they risk getting trapped if we manage to cut them off above. However, moving LEFT is common to open up space. Let's assume they move **LEFT to (8, 4)** or **DOWN to (9, 3)**. Either way, they are far from us. The priority remains our apple!\n\n### Step 2: Your Safe Moves (Snake #1 at (6, 2))\n\nWe are perfectly positioned at (6, 2) to grab that apple at (6, 3) next!\n\n**Your Options from (6, 2):**\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** YES! This is the apple! We eat it, we tie the score 3-3, and we grow to length 4. PURE GROWTH!\n2.  **DOWN (6, 1):** Safe space, but leads away from nearest apple. Wasteful.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 2):** Safe space. Retreats from the objective. Wasteful.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** NO! That's our old head/body segment! Immediate KO.\n\n**The Decision is Clear, Chat!**\n\nWe must go **UP** to (6, 3) and secure the apple. This is crucial for keeping pace with Snake #0.\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check (The Money Move: UP to (6, 3))\n\n*   **Our move:** (6, 2) -> (6, 3) (Apple)\n*   **Opponent's potential moves (from (9, 4)):** (9, 3), (8, 4).\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of collision. Snake 0 is still miles away on the right side of the board.\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nOnce we eat the apple at (6, 3), our head will be at (6, 3) and our body will be [(6, 2), (7, 2)]. We will be length 4.\n\nThe next closest apples are:\n1.  (5, 4) - 2 moves away (UP to (6, 4), LEFT to (5, 4))\n2.  (3, 4) - 3 moves away (LEFT, LEFT, UP/DOWN)\n\nOur plan is to secure the center-right by moving towards the center of the map, aiming for (5, 4) and then potentially cutting across to (3, 4). By controlling the dense apple areas, we force Snake 0 to either challenge our territory or stick to the sparse, wall-side apples. We are building the beginning of a powerful barrier!\n\nLet's get this $L$ and tie the score!\n\nUP",

We executed the plan perfectly and snagged (6, 3). Now the real game begins. We are longer, stronger, and in a perfect position to dominate the center!\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 3)\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 4\n\n**Opponent (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 4) - Hmm, they moved LEFT from (9, 4) to (8, 4)! Smart move.\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n*   Length: 4 (They also grew, wait, no, they didn't eat. They are still length 4. (9, 6) is their tail.)\n\nWait, let's re-examine that board state from the prompt.\n\n*Snake #0 - Head: (8, 4), Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)], Apples: 3*\n\nSince they moved from (9, 4) to (8, 4) and their length didn't change (still 4), their tail *should* have moved from (8, 6) to (9, 6). The list confirms (9, 6) is the tail now, meaning (8, 6) is free.\n\n**Board State:**\n 9 . . A . . . . . . .\n 8 A . . A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . A A\n 6 . A A . . . . . . T <--- (9,6) is the tail\n 5 . . . . . . A . . T\n 4 . . . A . A . . **0** T <--- Head 0 at (8, 4)\n 3 . A . . . . **1** T . . <--- Head 1 at (6, 3)\n 2 A . . . A . T T . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . A . . . . . A\n\nThe board shows:\n- Snake 1 Head (H) at (6, 3)\n- Snake 0 Head (0) at (8, 4)\n\nWe are positioned to hit the high-density apple zone. Snake 0 is chilling near the right wall but is now edging toward the center. Time to get aggressive, Chat!\n\n### Step 1: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (8, 4))\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 4). They are long (L=4) and currently staring at the apple at (8, 7) or maybe cutting across for (6, 5) or (5, 4).\n\n**Nearest Apples for Snake 0:**\n1.  (8, 7) - UP, UP, UP (3 moves)\n2.  (9, 7) - UP, UP, RIGHT (3 moves)\n3.  (6, 5) - LEFT, UP, LEFT (3 moves)\n4.  (5, 4) - LEFT, LEFT, LEFT (3 moves)\n\n**Snake 0 Options from (8, 4):**\n1.  **UP (8, 5):** Opens up path to the top right quadrant apples (8, 7), (9, 7). This is a strong move.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):** Safe space, pushes them toward the bottom, away from current apples. Less likely.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 4):** Moves them decidedly toward the center and potentially (5, 4) or (6, 5). This is also very strong.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 4):** NO! That's their body segment! Instant KO!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 0 will likely move **UP to (8, 5)** to grab the high-value (8, 7) cluster, or **LEFT to (7, 4)** to contest the center. Since they just moved left, continuing the left pivot seems strategically sound to avoid that X=9 wall again. Let's prioritize the threat from (7, 4).\n\n### Step 2: Your Safe Moves (Snake #1 at (6, 3))\n\nWe are at (6, 3) and aiming to secure the center apples before the opponent can flank us.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Snake 1:**\n1.  (5, 4) - UP, LEFT (2 moves). *Crucial target.*\n2.  (6, 5) - UP, UP (2 moves). *Excellent target.*\n3.  (3, 4) - LEFT, LEFT, UP (3 moves).\n\n**Your Options from (6, 3):**\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** Excellent move. Gets one step closer to (5, 4) or (6, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):** NO! That's our old head/body segment! Instant KO!\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):** Safe space. Puts us on the path to (3, 4), or allows us to cut up towards (5, 4) or (5, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):** NO! That's our body segment! Instant KO!\n\nWe have two great safe options: UP or LEFT.\n\n*   **Option A: UP to (6, 4):** This is the most direct path to the crucial apple at (6, 5) (via one more UP) or (5, 4) (via one more LEFT). It maintains separation from Snake 0.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (5, 3):** This moves us toward the (3, 4) apple and also prepares for (5, 4) via an UP move next turn. This puts less of a barrier between us and Snake 0 if they also move LEFT.\n\nLet's look at collision potential if they go (7, 4) and we go (5, 3). We'd be separated by (6, 3) and (6, 4). No immediate danger.\n\nIf we go UP to (6, 4), we are strongly positioned to get (6, 5) next. This is a very valuable central apple, Chat. This also gives us room to manoeuvre.\n\n**Let\u2019s choose UP to (6, 4).** It secures our ascent into the central apple cluster and keeps our head safely away from opponent's immediate flanking attempts.\n\n### Step 3: Collision Check (The Money Move: UP to (6, 4))\n\n*   **Our move:** (6, 3) -> (6, 4)\n*   **Opponent's potential moves (from (8, 4)):** (8, 5) or (7, 4).\n\n1.  If Snake 0 goes (8, 5): We are safe.\n2.  If Snake 0 goes (7, 4): We are safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risk. We are good to dominate the center.\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy Note\n\n**Objective: Control the Center and Box Out Snake 0.**\n\n1.  **Turn 5: Move UP to (6, 4).** Secures vital real estate.\n2.  **Turn 6 Plan:** From (6, 4), we have two close apples: (6, 5) [UP] and (5, 4) [LEFT]. If Snake 0 moves (7, 4), they might try to cut in front of us.\n    *   If Snake 0 appears to be going for (6, 5) (e.g., they move (7, 5)), we must move LEFT to (5, 4) to ensure we get an apple.\n    *   If Snake 0 continues moving left, we can commit to UP to (6, 5).\n\nBy moving to (6, 4), we put ourselves in a position where Snake 0 has to choose between fighting us for the center (5, 4) and (6, 5), or retreating towards the wall apples like (8, 7). If we can get (6, 5) and/or (5, 4) and push our body right, we can potentially cut off access to the middle-left side of the board for Snake 0.\n\nLet's get that height advantage, Chat! We're going UP!\n\nFINGERS CROSSED, NO LUCK NEEDED, ONLY SKILL!\n\nUP",

He grows maybe to 4 on (6,5), but we eat (5,4) same-ish time and WALL COL7-8, loopin' to starve his north noms like (2,6)/(1,6).

We *crushed* the mid-game and grabbed the central ground, exactly as planned!\n\n### Turn 6 - Current State Review\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 4) - PERFECT positioning!\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2)]\n*   Length: 4\n\n**Opponent (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 4) - Wait, they moved LEFT from (8, 4) to (7, 4)!

They are staring directly at the action.\n\n**Nearest Apples for Snake 0:**\n1.  (6, 5) - UP, LEFT (2 moves). *High priority collision target.*\n2.  (5, 4) - LEFT, LEFT, or DOWN, LEFT, UP (3 moves).\n3.  (8, 7) - UP, UP, UP (3 moves).\n\n**Snake 0 Options from (7, 4):**\n1.  **UP (7, 5):** Direct path toward (6, 5). This prevents us from going (6, 5) via (6, 4) -> (6, 5) without a collision. **HIGH THREAT OF COLLISION IF WE ALSO GO UP.**\n2.  **DOWN (7, 3):** Safe space, but moves them away from apples. Unlikely.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 4):** NO! That's currently *our* head! **HEAD-ON COLLISION IF WE STAY PUT AND THEY MOVE LEFT.** (Wait, since we move first, if we move, they move into our old spot. But if we go somewhere else, they hit us! This is a head-to-head threat.)\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 4):** NO! That's their body segment! Instant KO!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 0's most aggressive and sensible move is **UP to (7, 5)** to gain height and contest (6, 5), or **LEFT to (6, 4) IF THEY BELIEVE WE WILL MOVE AWAY FROM (6, 4).** Since a direct LEFT move is a potential KO into our current position, they are highly incentivized to move UP to (7, 5) or DOWN, or try to out-maneuver us.\n\n### Step 2: Your Safe Moves & Priority Target (Snake #1 at (6, 4))\n\nWe are at (6, 4). Our top two targets are (6, 5) [UP] and (5, 4) [LEFT].\n\n**Your Options from (6, 4):**\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Apple! Instant score. Best move for value.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** NO! Body segment! Instant KO!\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Apple! Also an instant score. Great move.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** NO! Opponent's head is there! **HEAD-ON COLLISION IF THEY STAY PUT AND WE MOVE RIGHT.**\n\nWait, the move is simultaneous.\n\n*   If we move RIGHT to (7, 4), and they move UP to (7, 5): We hit their old position (7, 4) and are safe.\n*   If we move RIGHT to (7, 4), and they move DOWN to (7, 3): We hit their old position (7, 4) and are safe.\n*   If we move RIGHT to (7, 4), and they move LEFT to (6, 4): We move into their old spot (7, 4), and they move into our old spot (6, 4). SAFE!\n*   If we move RIGHT to (7, 4), and they stay put (Impossible, they must move): Irrelevant.\n\nMoving RIGHT is actually safe, but it takes us away from the apples at x=5 and x=6. We don't want to move right.\n\n**Focus on UP and LEFT (the two apple moves):**\n\n#### Case A: Move UP to (6, 5) (Apple Grab, High Collision Risk)\n*   **If Snake 0 moves UP (7, 5):** No collision. We get the apple! They are safe too.\n*   **If Snake 0 moves LEFT (6, 4):** They hit our old spot, (6, 4). We get the apple! SAFE for us.\n*   **If Snake 0 moves DOWN (7, 3):** No collision. We get the apple!\n\nThis move looks phenomenal *unless* they also move UP and aim to block us in two future turns. It guarantees an apple now.\n\n#### Case B: Move LEFT to (5, 4) (Apple Grab, Low Collision Risk)\n*   **If Snake 0 moves UP (7, 5):** No collision. We get the apple!\n*   **If Snake 0 moves LEFT (6, 4):** They hit our old spot, (6, 4). We get the apple! SAFE for us.\n*   **If Snake 0 moves DOWN (7, 3):** No collision. We get the apple!\n\nThis also guarantees an apple now.\n\n### Step 3: Deciding Between UP (6, 5) and LEFT (5, 4)\n\nWe want to prioritize cutting the opponent off.\n\nIf we go UP to (6, 5):\n*   We gain high ground.\n*   We force Snake 0 to decide if they want to fight us in the narrow vertical path (x=6) or go wide (x=7, x=8).\n*   We position ourselves perfectly to sweep for (3, 8), (0, 8), (2, 9).\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5, 4):\n*   We put space between us and Snake 0 immediately.\n*   We block the path for Snake 0 to turn left and go up the X=5 column easily.\n*   We position ourselves to grab (3, 4).\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 5), and Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 5), we turn the game into a race up the center-right side. If we snag (6, 5), we are length 5, and they are length 4. Our body will leave a trail [(6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2)]. The tail moves from (7, 2) to (6, 3). No, wait. We ate an apple on the last turn, so we are length 4 now. Our tail stays at (7, 2). *If we eat another apple now, the tail stays, and we grow to 5.*\n\nIf we go UP, we block a critical path for Snake 0. If we go LEFT, we open up the X=6 channel for Snake 0 to potentially shoot up to (6, 5) next turn if they move (7, 5) -> (6, 5).\n\nSince we are longer, we should use our body to create barriers. Moving UP to (6, 5) is the most aggressive move. It forces Snake 0 UP, or forces them to retreat DOWN.\n\n**Strategic Long-Term:** We must box Snake 0 into the eastern side of the map (X > 7).\n1.  **T6: UP to (6, 5).** Grow to length 5. Block the (6, 5) spot.\n2.  **T7:** From (6, 5), we can move UP along X=6 to pursue (3, 8) and (0, 8), or move LEFT towards (5, 4) if Snake 0 hasn't taken it.\n\nLet's commit to the high-ground, Chat! We are snatching (6, 5) and flexing!\n\n### Step 4: Final Collision Check - UP (6, 5)\n\nOur move: (6, 4) -> (6, 5). EAT APPLE.\nOpponent (7, 4) must move to a safe spot: (7, 5), (7, 3), or (6, 4).\n\n1.  If Snake 0 goes (7, 5): Safe.\n2.  If Snake 0 goes (7, 3): Safe.\n3.  If Snake 0 goes (6, 4): They hit our vacated spot. Safe.\n\nThis move is 100% safe. We get an apple, we grow, and we take central turf. LET'S GOOOOO!\n\n***\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (T7-T9):** We are length 5 after this. Our goal is to use our new length to wall off the center. If Snake #0 moves to (7, 5), we move LEFT to (5, 5) or (5, 4) to try and cap both vital central apples. If we can get (6, 5), (5, 4), and (3, 4) sequentially, we will be unstoppable and can push our body across X=5 to trap the enemy on the right.\n\nUP",

Last LEFT was GOD-TIER, invadin' without a blink \u2013 now we DOUBLE DOWN, FLOOD HIS ZONE, AND SNIPE THAT (5,4) NEXT TURN TO PULL AHEAD 5-4 WHILE TRAPPIN' HIS SHORT ASS IN ROW2-4 SQUEEZE. Who's hyped to watch him panic-crash into his own tail or our growin' empire? LET'S BURY THIS RIVAL LIVE, CHAT \u2013 NO MERCY, JUST DOMINATION! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc80\n\nBREAKIN' IT DOWN STEP-BY-STEP FOR THE SQUAD \u2013 HEAD AT (7,4), ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SLIPS, WE EAT OR WE WALL! \ud83d\ude80\n\n- RIGHT to (8,4)?

Can't slide forward when our trail's plugged right there, CHAT \u2013 TOTAL DISASTER, AVOID! \u274c\n- UP to (7,5)? CLEAN EMPTY SPOT, BOARD-SAFE (no edge crash, our tail dips from (9,5) far east, his junk's col6-7 low-row locked \u2013 can't stretch to col7 row5 this turn). Body shifts smooth: H'=(7,5), B1=old H (7,4), B2=(8,4), B3=(9,4) with tail chop from (9,5) no-grow. Angles us north-ish col7, chains UP x2 to (7,7)e then RIGHT to (8,7) apple in 3-4, or LEFT to (6,5) post-block if he greeds up. Keeps 3-4 follow-ups open (north apples like (8,7)/(9,7), or flex south), but lets #1 feast unchecked on (6,5) or (5,4) center \u2013 we hug col7 safe, he slips and grows to 4 while we detour? Solid survival, but weak pressure \u2013 why chill when we can STRANGLE? \u26a0\ufe0f\u2705\n- DOWN to (7,3)?

Drops to row3 col7 open turf, sets LEFT to (6,3) (his B1 vacates to old H anyway), or DOWN further to bottom loop (7,2) empty toward (9,0)/(4,2) in 4-5. 2-3 paths south flex, but drifts AWAY from hot apples (5,4)/(6,5) while exposin' our north flank \u2013 #1 could UP-greed north to (2,6)/(1,6) chain, leavin' us chasin' fringe scraps?

Invades his core zone, cuts RIGHT/UP escapes (our new row4 wall col6-9 blocks (7,4)/(6,5) returns), forces him into tight row2-3 hook where his tail (7,2) trips him. Multiple lanes: LEFT x2 to (5,4) feast +grow to 5, or UP from (6,4) to (6,5) counter-snipe if he skips, or even DOWN to (6,3) squeeze his old trail. Ruthless trap-max, greed-max, 4+ options no dead-ends \u2013 why detour when we can CHOKE HIS BREATH AND FEAST FIRST? HELL YEAH, THIS IS THE KILL SHOT, CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd12\n\nTRASHED THE HESITATORS \u2013 LEFT CRUSHES FOR MAX PRESSURE + QUICK GREED, FLANKIN' #1'S EVERY MOVE WHILE WE STACK APPLES.

No risks \u2013 his short reach can't counter our invade!\n\nLong-term strat note: LEFT to (6,4) center lock \u2013 next LEFT to (5,4) apple eat/grow to 5, wall row4 col5-9; if he UP-eats (6,5), counter UP from (5,4) to (5,5)e flex north block (1,6)/(2,6); if he LEFT-eats (5,4), pivot UP to (6,5) snipe his old apple or RIGHT back wall him; grow to 6+ in 2-3 turns, flood col4-6 row3-5 to starve south/north, force row2 tail-crash; avoid east overextend til 6 apples, then loop (8,7)/(9,7).\n\nLEFT",
