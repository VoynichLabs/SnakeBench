Next aim for (3,1).\n- **Strategy for next turn:** From (3,3), proceed DOWN toward (3,1) unless something changes (enemy moves or body growth changes options).

Yes.\n  - Valid move.\n\n## Let's look for the next closest apple(s):\n\nRemaining apples:\n- (5,6): Manhattan distance = |3-5| + |1-6| = 2+5=7\n- (2,5): = 1+4=5\n- (7,4): = 4+3=7\n- (5,7): = 2+6=8\n- (1,1): = 2+0=2\n\nSo, the nearest apple is at (1,1).\n\n## Is the path clear to (1,1)?\n\nCurrent position: (3,1).\n- LEFT to (2,1), then LEFT to (1,1).\n- Both (2,1) and (1,1) are free.\n\nAlternatively:\n- DOWN to (3,0), then LEFT x2, then UP to (1,1) — that's longer.\n\nSo, moving LEFT toward (1,1) is the most direct.\n\n## Risk check\n\n- Is (2,1) blocked? No.\n- Is (3,0) blocked? No.\n- Are any enemy snakes in the area? No.\n- Is my own tail in the way? No.\n\nNo risk making this move.\n\n## Final thoughts/strategy for this and next turn:\n\n- Move LEFT to (2,1).\n- Next turn, move LEFT again to (1,1) and eat another apple.\n- Be aware: after eating, my body will be length 5 and fill up more space, so avoid looping into a dead end. Consider planning NOT to immediately turn upwards into my own growing body.\n\n---\n\n**MOVE: LEFT**\n\n---\n\n### Self-note for next turn:\n\nAfter eating the apple at (1,1), do NOT immediately move UP, as that space may become clogged with my body. Instead, consider moving RIGHT along the bottom or pausing to ensure the path is open before heading up to the next target (ideally (2,5) or assess apple safety).",
