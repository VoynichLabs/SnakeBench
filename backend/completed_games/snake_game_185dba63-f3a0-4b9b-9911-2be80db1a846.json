Since I'm at the bottom of the board, I should prioritize moving to the right to avoid hitting the wall.\n\nOnce I get close to the apple at (5, 0), I should reassess the situation and decide whether to go for other apples or focus on avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Prioritize apples.\n2. Avoid walls and other snakes.\n3. Plan a path that maximizes apple collection.\n\nNext turn, I will re-evaluate the board state and decide based on the new positions.
