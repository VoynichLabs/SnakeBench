Safe.\n   - **Result:** Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (y decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (4,7)\n   - Check boundaries: y=7 is within bounds.\n   - Check self-collision: Safe (no body).\n   - Check enemy collision: Enemy head at (5,4), not at (4,7). Safe.\n   - **Result:** Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (x decreases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (3,8)\n   - Check boundaries: x=3 is within bounds.\n   - Check self-collision: Safe.\n   - Check enemy collision: Enemy head at (5,4), not at (3,8). Safe.\n   - **Result:** Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x increases by 1):**\n   - New head position: (5,8)\n   - Check boundaries: x=5 is within bounds.\n   - Check self-collision: Safe.\n   - Check enemy collision: Enemy head at (5,4), not at (5,8). Safe.\n   - **Result:** Safe.\n\n**All four moves are safe.** No immediate death threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prioritize Apple Collection**\nNow, I look at which moves allow me to reach apples on the next turn.\n\n- **Apples at:**\n  - (1,7): Distance from (4,8) is 3 (left) + 1 (down) = 4 moves (not reachable in 1 turn).\n  - (2,7): Distance is 2 (left) + 1 (down) = 3 moves.\n  - (3,6): Distance is 1 (left) + 2 (down) = 3 moves.\n  - (9,2): Distance is 5 (right) + 6 (down) = 11 moves.\n  - (0,8): Distance is 4 (left) + 0 (y) = 4 moves.\n\n**Closest apples:**\n- (2,7): Can reach with **LEFT** (to (3,8)) + **DOWN** (to (3,7)) + **LEFT** (to (2,7)) in 3 turns.\n- (3,6): Can reach with **LEFT** (to (3,8)) + **DOWN** (to (3,7)) + **DOWN** (to (3,6)) in 3 turns.\n- (0,8): Can reach with **LEFT** (to (3,8)) + **LEFT** (to (2,8)) + **LEFT** (to (1,8)) + **LEFT** (to (0,8)) in 4 turns.\n\n**Best immediate apple reach:**\n- **DOWN (to (4,7))** does not reach any apple directly, but it is adjacent to (4,7), which is not an apple.\n- **LEFT (to (3,8))** is adjacent to (3,6) and (2,7), but not directly reaching an apple.\n- **UP (to (4,9))** and **RIGHT (to (5,8))** do not reach any apples.\n\n**No apple is reachable in 1 move.** So, I must prioritize moves that position me well for future apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Positioning for Future Moves**\nI need to consider which moves keep me flexible for future turns.\n\n1. **UP (to (4,9)):**\n   - Moves me toward the top edge.\n   - Future moves: Can go LEFT/RIGHT to explore top row, but limited downward options.\n   - Risk: If enemy moves toward me from below, I may get trapped.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (4,7)):**\n   - Moves me toward the middle of the board.\n   - Future moves: Can go LEFT/RIGHT to reach (3,6) or (2,7) in 2 moves.\n   - Advantage: More central position, easier to reach multiple apples.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (3,8)):**\n   - Moves me toward the left side.\n   - Future moves: Can go DOWN to reach (3,6) in 1 move, or LEFT to reach (2,7) in 2 moves.\n   - Advantage: Directly adjacent to (3,6), which is an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (5,8)):**\n   - Moves me toward the right side.\n   - Future moves: Limited apple reachability; no apples nearby.\n   - Disadvantage: Less strategic positioning.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT (to (3,8))** because:\n- It is adjacent to (3,6), an apple that can be reached in 1 more move (DOWN).\n- It keeps me flexible to reach (2,7) in 2 moves.\n- It avoids moving toward the edge (UP or RIGHT).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Avoiding Enemy Threats**\nThe enemy snake is at (5,4). It is not currently threatening me, but I should avoid moves that could lead to future collisions.\n\n- If I move **DOWN (to (4,7))**, the enemy could move UP to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,4), but no immediate threat.\n- If I move **LEFT (to (3,8))**, the enemy could move RIGHT to (6,4), but no direct collision risk.\n- If I move **UP (to (4,9))**, the enemy could move UP to (5,5), but no direct collision risk.\n- If I move **RIGHT (to (5,8))**, the enemy could move RIGHT to (6,4), but no direct collision risk.\n\nNo immediate enemy threat, so positioning for apple collection is the priority.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Long-Term Strategy**\n**Short-term plan:**\n1. Move **LEFT** to (3,8) to position near (3,6).\n2. Next turn, move **DOWN** to (3,7) to reach (3,6) and collect an apple.\n3. After collecting (3,6), move **LEFT** to (2,7) to position near (2,7).\n4. Next turn, move **DOWN** to (2,6) to reach (2,7) and collect another apple.\n5. Continue exploring the left side of the board to collect remaining apples.\n\n**Avoid:**\n- Moving toward the enemy without a clear advantage.\n- Getting trapped in the top-right corner where the enemy could block me.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\nAfter evaluating all options, the best move is **LEFT** because:\n- It positions me near an apple (3,6) for the next turn.\n- It keeps me flexible to reach other apples.\n- It avoids moving toward the edge unnecessarily.\n\n**Final Move:** LEFT",

Next, I need to prioritize the next closest apple, which is (5,3), while monitoring Snake #0\u2019s movement.\n2. **Monitor Snake #0\u2019s movement**: Snake #0 is at (3,5). If it moves toward (4,5) or (3,6), I should avoid (3,7) or (4,8) to prevent collisions. If it moves toward (5,5), I\u2019ll avoid (5,8) to block its expansion.\n3. **Expand body strategically**: After collecting (5,3), my snake will grow to [(5,3), (0,8), (1,8)]. Ensure the tail doesn\u2019t block future movement. If Snake #0 moves aggressively, I\u2019ll adjust to block or retreat.\n4. **Avoid enemy aggression**: Snake #0 could move toward (4,5) or (3,6). If it moves toward (3,6), I\u2019ll avoid (3,7) to prevent collisions. If it moves toward (4,5), I\u2019ll avoid (4,8) to deny space.\n5. **Plan for next apples**: After (5,3), the next highest-priority apples are (9,2) and (1,1). Focus on (9,2) if Snake #0 is near (5,8), or (1,1) if the path is clear.\n\n**Turn 6-10 Plan:**\n- **Turn 6:** Move **DOWN** to (0,7) to avoid (0,8) blocking future movement and scout toward (5,3). This also positions me to block Snake #0\u2019s potential moves toward (0,8) or (5,8).\n- **Turn 7:** If (5,3) is reachable, move **DOWN** to (5,3) to collect the apple and grow. If Snake #0 moves toward (4,5), I\u2019ll move **RIGHT** to (0,8) to avoid (4,8) and scout (5,3).\n- **Turn 8:** If (9,2) is reachable, move toward it. If Snake #0 is near (5,8), I\u2019ll focus on expanding toward (4,8) or (5,8) to block it.\n- **Turn 9:** If (1,1) is reachable, move toward it. If Snake #0 is near (5,8), I\u2019ll prioritize moving toward (4,8) or (5,8) to deny it space.\n- **Turn 10:** Adjust based on Snake #0\u2019s positioning. If it\u2019s near (5,8), I\u2019ll focus on moving toward (4,8) or (5,8) to block it.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- If Snake #0 moves aggressively (e.g., toward (5,8)), I\u2019ll prioritize moving toward (4,8) or (5,8) to deny it space.\n- If I collect (5,3), I\u2019ll then focus on (9,2) or (1,1) depending on enemy positioning.\n- Avoid moving into (3,7) if Snake #0 is moving toward (3,6) to prevent collisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Current State (Turn 6):**\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (0,8)\n  - Body: [(1,8)]\n  - Apples collected: 2\n- **Enemy (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (4,5)\n  - Body: [(4,6), (3,6)]\n  - Apples: 2\n- **Apples remaining:** (5,3), (9,2), (1,1), (0,0)\n- **Closest apple to (0,8):** (5,3) (requires moving DOWN to (0,7), then DOWN to (1,7), then RIGHT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,3)).\n- **Safe Moves:** All four directions are safe (no self-collision, no enemy collision).\n- **Best Move:** **DOWN** to (0,7) to avoid blocking (0,8) and position myself to move toward (5,3) in the next turn. This also allows me to scout Snake #0\u2019s potential moves.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Move:** DOWN",

Safe moves are DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), or RIGHT to (5,5); UP is invalid as it hits my own body at (4,6). LEFT would back me into a potential corner against my old body and board edge, limiting future options\u2014e.g., from (3,5), RIGHT hits my own tail/history, UP hits my body, and I'd have limited escape to DOWN or LEFT only. DOWN to (4,4) is safe and open but takes me away from the nearby apple at (5,3), requiring extra moves to get back on track (e.g., then RIGHT to (5,4) next turn). RIGHT to (5,5) is the best: it directly moves me toward (5,3) without risks, keeps multiple follow-up moves available (DOWN, RIGHT, UP to (5,6)), avoids head-on collisions (enemy is distant in column 1), and opens paths to other apples like (0,0) or (1,1) if needed. Enemy snake is at (1,9) with body downward; they'll likely prioritize the (0,8) apple by going DOWN to (1,8) or LEFT (fewer head-on risks for me here). No immediate traps or enemy threats.\n\nPlan: RIGHT to (5,5) to line up with (5,3). Next turn, DOWN to (5,4) to get closer. If enemy moves RIGHT or DOWN from (1,9), prepare evasion UP to row 6; otherwise, continue DOWN on turn 8 to eat at (5,3) for a 3-2 lead. Monitor if enemy eats (0,8) and approaches column 2-4.\n\nRIGHT",
