Opponent head at (8,7) with a single tail at (7,7). Both sides have 1 apple so far.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: LEFT is backwards into my own body (not allowed). Safe options are UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), or RIGHT to (4,2). RIGHT is especially juicy because there\u2019s an apple at (4,2) waiting to be eaten.\n\nDECISION: PICK RIGHT.\n\nWHY RIGHT: It lets me eat an apple this turn, growing to length 3 with a head at (4,2) and body (3,2)-(2,2). I\u2019ll move to 2-0-1 apples in the lead (me: 2, opponent: 1) and keep max mobility. No immediate collision risk with the rival, and I gain tempo to press the box later.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Maintain aggressive pressure but stay out of tight corners. Use the new head position to threaten lines that could corral the rival if he tries to squeeze through.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next turns): Push to trap him by guiding his path toward walls and leveraging my growing length to block his options. If I can force a risky head-on with the higher apple count, I\u2019ll win the exchange. Keep scanning his moves from (8,7) and avoid giving him easy escapes.\n\nTHE FANS ARE WATCHING.

UP would slam us straight into (1,8) \u2013 our own segment \u2013 so that\u2019s a dead\u2011end.  \n\n\ud83e\udd14 **What\u2019s the game\u2011plan?**  \n- **LEFT** pushes us to the edge, leaving only UP/DOWN later \u2013 that\u2019s a tight spot, not ideal for staying flexible.  \n- **RIGHT** slides us into a narrow corridor; we\u2019d lose the DOWN escape hatch and could get boxed in if #0 decides to cut us off.  \n- **DOWN** not only keeps three fresh exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) but also lands us on the juicy (1,6) apple \ud83c\udf4e, nudging our score to 6\u202fvs\u202f5 and giving us the lead.  \n\n\ud83d\udc40 **Opponent vibes**: #0 is at (4,6) and likely eyeing moves LEFT/RIGHT or maybe a strategic DOWN.

We\u2019re not chasing apples this turn\u2014we\u2019re tightening space and pressuring his options.\n\nSAFE MOVES from here: DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), or RIGHT to (5,6). UP is illegal because it\u2019s right into our neck at (4,7).\n\nDECISION: We go LEFT to (3,6). It keeps us flexible, nudges us toward a central-left zone, and starts a corridor that can funnel him later without risking an immediate collision this turn.\n\nREASONING: We\u2019re in a balanced lane with the enemy on the top-left. Going left preserves multiple safe follow-ups (instead of committing to a dead-end or chasing him into a trap that we\u2019re not ready to finish). It also avoids edge traps while keeping our options open to swing toward either side as the board evolves.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Build a flexible central cage that gradually squeezes the rival and blocks his escape routes. Use our longer body to cut off cross-paths and force him into tighter spaces where we can force head-on if it helps swing the score. Maintain safety first, then leverage position to pressure his route choices. If we pull ahead on apples, we can consider more aggressive maneuvers, but for now we prioritize safe space control and pressuring him into mistakes.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: 15) Move LEFT to (3,6). 16) Assess his move; respond with either DOWN to (3,5) or LEFT to (2,6) to shrink his options. 17+) Keep central lanes open and watch for opportunities to trap without risking self-collision.\n\nMOVE PLAN:\nLEFT",

It also preserves space to sidestep future head-ons and sets up a potential corridor squeeze later. RIGHT would keep us mid-board, but UP gives us a cleaner runway to maneuver and threaten from the top flank.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Move to (3,8). After that, keep the head on the top line if possible, stay away from their immediate column, and look for gaps to thread into their space without getting boxed in.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Use the top area to pressure and potentially herd them toward the edge.

SAFE options this turn: UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), RIGHT to (8,8). LEFT would crash into your own neck, so we veto that.\n\n- WHY UP: Moving UP keeps multiple escape routes open, stays away from the opponent\u2019s long body on the left, and puts you on a direct path to top-row apples (especially around (8,9) and (9,9)). It also signals a strong, non-committal stance toward the top-right quadrant where you can threaten apples and keep pressure without getting boxed in.\n\n- SHORT-TERM PLAN (TURN 28): Take UP to (7,9) now. This preserves options and heads you toward the top-row apple cluster. If the coast stays clean, next turn you can slide RIGHT to (8,9) to eat the apple there and grow, tightening your grip on the map and narrowing future traps for the opponent.\n\n- LONG-TERM NOTE: Keep the top-right corridor as a staging area. Don\u2019t chase the enemy\u2019s tail into a trap where you cut yourself off. Maintain flexibility, threaten high-value apples, and look for opportunities to force favorable head-on dynamics if the score gap continues.\n\n- RISK AWARENESS: The enemy is far at (4,5) with a long body looping toward the left; a reckless turn toward the left would bite you, so we\u2019re sticking to a plan that expands space rather than pinches it.\n\n- FINAL DIRECTION CHOICE FOR THIS TURN: UP\n\nUP",

Only safe: LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n- Opponent (Head at 5,5) is far away and not threatening an immediate wrap, so we don\u2019t need to rush into a trap.\n\nSAFE MOVES:\n- LEFT to (6,9): safe, keeps top-space options open, but no immediate growth.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): safe and it\u2019s an apple, so we grow and boost future dominance on the top-right corridor.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE: RIGHT to (8,9) \u2014 EAT THE APPLE\n- Why RIGHT? It\u2019s a clean way to grow with a high-value target in reach, expanding your control of the top row while not inviting a risky chase from the opponent. You\u2019ll gain +1 apple and add a segment, tightening your grip on space. It also sets you up to threaten (9,9) next, then the (9,8) apple if it\u2019s still there.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Eat at (8,9) this turn.\n- Next turn, consider sliding to (9,9) to pressure the far-right corridor or drop to (8,8) to chase the nearby top-row apple cluster if it\u2019s still present. Keep the top-right channel alive and avoid chasing the opponent into dead-ends.\n\nRISK AWARENESS:\n- You\u2019re still behind on apples (5 vs 10), so staying in space and stacking growth while maintaining multiple escape options is wise. Avoid low-percentage head-ons and don\u2019t twist into the left-half bottleneck near the opponent.\n\nRIGHT",

We\u2019re on the edge, so keeping space and denying them easy collisions is key.\n\nDECISION: Take DOWN to (9,8) to grab the apple there and grow. This keeps us on the top-right corridor, preserves escape routes, and puts us in a strong lead position without risking a head-on this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:  \n- Move DOWN to (9,8) this turn and eat the apple.  \n- After growth, reassess: if the next apple along the edge is still there, decide whether to continue hugging the border toward more apples, or pull back to create a safe cross-path to the center if the opponent starts pressing.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:  \n- Stay aggressive but cage the rival with space and multi-path exits instead of risky chases.  \n- Use edge apples to extend the lead while keeping the top-right corridor open for evasive maneuvers and potential head-on trades if the score gaps tighten.\n\nDOWN",

Top options: UP (9,8) would crash into our own neck, RIGHT is off-board, so only LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) are SAFE.\n\nEVALUATE SAFE MOVES:\n- LEFT to (8,7): SAFE, keeps us in the top-right corridor and puts us in range of pressuring his row y=5 from above. Could set up future traps if he blunders.\n- DOWN to (9,6): SAFE, preserves a strong retreat path along the right edge, opens flexible center access, and makes it harder for him to pin us into the corner.\n\nDECISION (SOUND LOGIC TIME): DOWN is the cleaner, more flexible choice this turn. It keeps multiple escape routes open, avoids any risk of stepping into his wall, and drags our chase a little closer to his risk zone without courting a head-on collision. It also maintains pressure on his horizontal wall from above in a future sequence.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (FOR NEXT TLOTS):\n- Stay hugging the right edge with mobility, never sprint into his body, and lean toward coercing him into tighter corridors.\n- Use DOWN moves to peel him away from the center wall he\u2019s formed on y=5, then converge when the timing is right.\n- If he ever trips into his own tail or into us, punish with a surgical shift to tighten the space and force a disadvantageous turn for him.\n- Always avoid head-on trades\u2014our apple count still trails, so safety > chaos.\n\nfinal move: down",
