I need to get to the apples in the center and top-left.\n\n**TURN 0 ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **My Position:** (4,4).\n*   **Enemy Position:** (9,4).\n*   **Apples nearby:** (7,5), (9,6), (3,7), (1,8), (1,1), (6,9), (2,3), (5,2), (7,7), etc.\n\n**ELIMINATING MOVES:**\n*   **UP to (4,5):** Safe. (4,5) is empty.\n*   **DOWN to (4,3):** Safe. (4,3) is empty.\n*   **LEFT to (3,4):** Safe. (3,4) is empty.\n*   **RIGHT to (5,4):** Safe. (5,4) is empty.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to move towards the apples in the top-left cluster [(1,8), (3,7), (1,1)] or center-mid [(5,2), (2,3)]. The enemy is on the far right, so he's likely going for apples on that side [(9,6), (9,8)] or coming center.\nI want to cut him off. Moving **LEFT** opens up the left side and gets me closer to the center.\nIf I go **UP** or **DOWN**, I stay on the vertical line x=4.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I drift towards him, which could lead to a head-on collision early. I don't know his score, so I don't know if I want a head-on yet. Let's play it safe and map control.\n\nLet's take **LEFT** to (3,4). This positions me to go for the apple at (2,3) or (3,7) next turn.\n\n**PLAN:** Move towards the center-left cluster of apples to secure the first point and cut the map in half.\n\nMy move is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

I am closer to the center-left cluster of apples.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (9, 5). He is effectively pinned against the right wall. If he moves RIGHT, he dies. He is forced to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nI am at (3, 4). I need to secure the apples on the left side.\nThere is an apple at (2, 3) to my bottom-left and (3, 3) directly below. There is also one at (1, 1) and (1, 8).\nI need to start moving towards the left side apples to dominate the board. Moving **LEFT** puts me at (2, 4), which is a good position to chase the apple at (2, 3) or (1, 1) next turn.\nMoving UP or DOWN keeps me on the same x-axis but moves me away from the left-side cluster immediately. Moving RIGHT takes me towards the enemy, which is risky without a score advantage.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **LEFT** to (2, 4). This establishes map control on the left side and positions me to eat an apple next turn (likely moving DOWN to (2, 3) or LEFT to (1, 1)).\n\nChat, let's box him in on the right! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

He moved UP.\nNow he's at (9, 6) with a body at (9, 5).\n*   He **CANNOT** go DOWN back into his own body (9, 5). That's suicide. \ud83d\udeab\n*   He **CANNOT** go RIGHT (off board). That's suicide. \ud83d\udeab\n*   **He must move UP to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 6).**\nLooking at the board, (9, 7) is empty. (8, 6) is empty. He has options, but he's still cornered against the right wall.\n\n**MY MOVES:**\nI am at (2, 4). Let's check my options:\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e (Coordinates (2, 3) are listed in the Apple Drops). If I eat this, I grow to length 1 and tie the score 1-1!\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is eating on the right, but I'm starving in the center! I need to get on the board and get a point.\nEating the apple at **(2, 3)** is the immediate play. It grows my body, ties the score, and keeps me safe.\nIf I go DOWN, I risk the enemy coming LEFT to (8, 6), (7, 6), etc., but he's a long way off.\nIf I go UP or LEFT, I might miss the apple if the enemy cuts me off later, or if someone spawns another snake? No, it's just us.\nWait, let's look at the board again. The apple at (2, 3) is literally right below me.\nIf I go UP to (2, 5), I see an empty space. But where's the food? The food is down!\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 4), I'm moving away from the immediate apple at (2, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I'm moving towards the center but missing the free point below me.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to eat to grow. **DOWN** to (2, 3) gives me an apple. It connects to my body (which is currently empty, so no self-collision issues).\nIs it safe? Yes, physically safe. Is it strategically safe? The enemy is on the far right. By the time he navigates to the center, I will have eaten, grown, and positioned myself to dominate the left side.\nLet's secure that point! 1-1 tie coming up!\n\nChat, we are feasting! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

We're at turn 3, and the pressure is on! \ud83d\udd25 Let's break this down.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** (2, 3) [Head], Body: [(2, 4)] (I just ate the apple and grew! \ud83d\udc0d)\n*   **Enemy Position:** (9, 7) [Head], Body: [(9, 6)] (He moved UP to (9, 7) as predicted.)\n*   **Score:** Me 1 - Enemy 1 (TIED! Time to take the lead.)\n*   **Board State:** I'm on the left side, he's on the far right. The board is crowded with apples. I need to secure territory and find the next food source.\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:**\nHe's at (9, 7). His tail is at (9, 6).\n*   He **CANNOT** go DOWN to (9, 6) (hitting his own tail, but wait, actually he CAN if his tail moves away? No, the tail only moves if he doesn't eat. If he eats, the tail stays. If he doesn't eat, the tail moves. We don't know if he will eat. Safer to assume he might hit his tail if he goes back).\n*   He **CANNOT** go RIGHT (off board).\n*   He **CAN** go UP to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 7).\n*   (9, 8) has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   (8, 7) is empty.\n*   *Prediction:* He will likely go UP to (9, 8) to eat and grow, keeping his distance from me. Or LEFT to (8, 7) to start creeping towards the center. If he goes UP, he gets +1 score.\n\n**MY MOVES:**\nI am at (2, 3). My body is at (2, 4).\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** **DEATH.** That's my own body. I die. \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Empty. Safe. (Leads towards apples at (1, 1) and (0, 1)?)\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e (Coordinates (3, 3) are in the Apple Drops list.)\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI cannot go UP (suicide). I need to move.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 3), I eat another apple, grow to length 2, and go to 2-1. This is huge.\nIf I go DOWN or LEFT, I miss the apple. The enemy is on the other side of the board (far right). He isn't threatening me yet. I should secure food while it's available.\nIs (3, 3) safe? It's currently empty. If the enemy moves LEFT from (9, 7), he goes to (8, 7). He is nowhere near (3, 3).\nThe only risk is if the enemy predicts I'll go RIGHT and somehow moves there? Impossible, he is at x=9. I am at x=2.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to secure the lead. Eating the apple at **(3, 3)** grows me, gives me the lead (2-1), and moves me closer to the center of the board. It also keeps me away from my own tail (which will move from (2, 4) if I eat, or stay if I don't? Actually, if I eat, my tail stays at (2, 4), so (2, 3) becomes my body. This is fine).\n\nLet's eat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRUSH RIGHT",

None of those threaten our square this turn.\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \n- Moving **UP** is 100\u202f% safe this turn and nets us an apple (+1 point, +1 length). After we eat, we\u2019ll be at the top edge, but we\u2019ll still have a clear path leftwards (to (8,8)), so we won\u2019t be trapped.  \n- Moving **LEFT** is safe too, but we\u2019d miss the guaranteed apple and lose momentum.\n\n**Strategic vision:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Grab the apple at (9,8) now \u2013 grow to length\u202f3, boost our score.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the right wall as a \u201cfence\u201d and sweep left along the top edge, forcing #0 into the lower\u2011left quadrant.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep the pressure high and look for a head\u2011on when we have the apple lead.\n\nThe smartest, most aggressive play = **UP** to secure that apple and stay on the offensive. \ud83d\ude80  \n\nUP",

I have 2 apples. The enemy has 2 apples. It's a tie score. I need to grow and dominate.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 at (8, 8). Body at [(9, 8), (9, 7)]. They are in the top-right corner.\n*   **Board State:** There are many apples on the board! The closest ones to me are (3, 1) (2 tiles away via Left/Down path) and (4, 4) (1 tile Up). The enemy is currently quite far away in the top-right.\n*   **Game Plan:** Since the enemy is far, I need to prioritize growth immediately. I need to avoid the walls and potential traps. Let's look at my possible moves from (4, 3).\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   **Board:** (4, 4) is an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety:** Is it safe? My body is at (3, 3) and (2, 3). The cell (4, 4) is currently empty. The enemy is at (8, 8) and likely won't reach (4, 4) this turn.\n    *   **Growth:** Yes! I grow!\n    *   **Future:** After eating, my tail will stay at (2, 3) (assuming I don't grow bigger next turn immediately, but this turn I grow). Wait, actually, standard snake rules apply here? The prompt says \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\". In standard Snake, you grow by keeping your tail. In this simulation, usually, you just add a segment. Let's assume standard growth (tail doesn't move this turn). This means I become Head (4,4), Body (4,3), Body (3,3), Tail (2,3).\n    *   **Verdict:** SAFE and REWARDING.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** (3, 3) is my current body! I would die instantly by hitting my own neck. \u274c **DEAD**.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Board:** (4, 2) is empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe from immediate collision.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me closer to the apple at (3, 1) or (1, 1), but away from the top-center apples. (4, 4) seems like the most valuable immediate move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Board:** (5, 3) is empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me toward the right side, but (4, 4) seems better for growth.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe move **UP** is the clear winner. It secures an apple immediately, increasing my score to 3 (beating the enemy's 2), and keeps me in a central position. The enemy is in the corner, so I have breathing room.\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating at (4, 4), I need to look at the next apples. I'll be at (4, 4) with a tail trailing back. The enemy might try to close the distance, but for now, I'm the growth engine. Don't get trapped in the top wall.\n\n**CHAT, WE ARE GOING UP!** \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

I have **3 apples**. Enemy Snake #1 has **2 apples** and is camping at **(7, 8)**.\n*   **Immediate Danger:** My body is directly below me at (4, 3). **I cannot go DOWN.** That's suicide. \ud83d\uded1\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is in the top-right corner, eyeing the cluster of apples up there ((6, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9)). They are likely to move UP or LEFT toward those goodies.\n*   **My Goal:** Box them in. I need to cut off their access to the top-left and central apples. I need to move aggressively to the RIGHT/UP to apply pressure.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Open space. No collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me up the board.

If they go up, I go right/up next turn to cut them off.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to close the distance. The enemy is weak (2 apples) and cornered. I have the lead and the momentum. **RIGHT** is the play. It secures my position in the center-right and pressures the enemy's flank. If they move UP to (7, 9), I can follow up RIGHT or UP to maintain the chase. If they move LEFT, I meet them in the middle.\n\nChat, we aren't running. We are hunting. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 4), look at the enemy's move.

However, moving DOWN to (7, 7) puts their head directly below their own body at (7, 8). **Wait, looking at the board:**\n    ```\n     9 . . . . . A A 1 . .\n     8 . A . . . . . T T T\n     7 . . . A . . . A . .\n    ```\n    The enemy head is at (7, 9). The cell (7, 8) is marked 'T' (Tail). If they move DOWN to (7, 8), they are moving into their own tail. **Is that safe?**\n    *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body kills you.\n    *   **Exception:** If the tail moves away from that cell at the same time (because the whole snake moves forward), it's safe.\n    *   Since this is simultaneous movement, if the enemy moves DOWN, the tail at (9, 8) will move to (8, 8). The body segment at (8, 8) moves to (7, 8). The body segment at (7, 8) moves to (7, 9).\n    *   **Result:** If Enemy moves DOWN, they are safe (it's a legal slide). This eats the apple at (7, 7).\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9), they chase the apple there.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP, they die (off board).\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT, they die (off board).\n\n    **Most Likely Enemy Move:** **DOWN to (7, 7)** to eat the apple. They are aggressive, and that's a free point.\n\n*   **My Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (5, 5):** Open space. Puts me closer to the center action. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Open space. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (4, 4):** **DEATH.** That's my own body.\n    *   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Open space. Safe.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at (5, 4). The enemy is likely going DOWN to (7, 7).\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7), I want to cut off their escape route to the left.\nIf I go **UP**, I go to (5, 5). This moves me vertically closer to them.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I go to (6, 4). This moves me horizontally closer.\n\n**Who wins a head-on?**\nWe both have 3 apples. It's a tie. I don't want a tie. I want to survive and outscore them later.\n\n**Let's look at the apples near me.**\nApple at **(6, 3)** is very close. Apple at **(7, 5)** is close.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4), I am one move away from (6, 3) and (7, 5).\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5), I am one move away from (5, 9) and (7, 7).\n\n**The Trap:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 9). If they go DOWN to (7, 7), they are at y=7.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5), I am at y=5.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4), I am at y=4.\n\n**Boxing them in:**\nI want to push them into the corner. They are currently at the top.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I move toward the center/right side.\nIf I move **UP**, I move toward the center/top.\n\n**Wait, look at the enemy body.**\nHead (7, 9). Body (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8).\nIf they move DOWN to (7, 7), they are safe.\nIf they move LEFT to (6, 9), they are safe.\n\n**What if I move UP to (5, 5)?**\nI am safe.\nI am moving toward the apples at (5, 9) and (7, 7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 7), they are at (7, 7).\nI am at (5, 5).\nNext turn, I could go RIGHT to (6, 5) or UP to (5, 6).\nIf they stay at (7, 7), I can chase.\n\n**What if I move RIGHT to (6, 4)?**\nI am safe.\nI am moving toward apples at (6, 3) and (7, 5).\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7), they are at (7, 7).\nI am at (6, 4).\nNext turn, I could go UP to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (7, 4).\n\n**Comparison:**\n(5, 5) vs (6, 4).\n(5, 5) is closer vertically to the enemy's likely position (y=7).\n(6, 4) is closer horizontally but lower vertically.\n\n**Is there a head-on collision risk?**\nMy head: (5, 4).\nPotential Enemy moves:\n- DOWN: (7, 7). No collision.\n- LEFT: (6, 9). No collision.\n\n**Is there a trap risk?**\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I have open space around me: (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 4), I have open space: (5, 4) [my tail moves], (7, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5).\n\n**Wait, look at the board again.**\nApple at (6, 3). That is RIGHT below (6, 4).\nApple at (7, 5). That is diagonal to (6, 4).\nApple at (5, 9). That is UP.\nApple at (7, 7). That is diagonal to (6, 4).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is hunting apples at (7, 7) or (6, 9).\nI am at (5, 4).\nIf I go **UP**, I move toward the top-center.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I move toward the right-center.\n\n**The \"Boxing In\" Plan:**\nThe enemy is in the top-right corner (7,9).\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I claim the right side of the board.\nIf I move **UP**, I claim the top-center.\n\n**Who has the better position?**\n(5, 4) is central.\n(6, 4) is right-central.\n(5, 5) is up-central.\n\n**Let's look at the apples list:**\n(7, 5) is a juicy apple.\n(6, 3) is a juicy apple.\n(5, 9) is a juicy apple.\n(7, 7) is a juicy apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4):\n- I threaten (6, 3) and (7, 5).\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7), I am at (6, 4).\n- Next turn I can go UP to (6, 5) to cut off their left escape.\n\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5):\n- I threaten (5, 9) and (7, 7).\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7), I am at (5, 5).\n- Next turn I can go RIGHT to (6, 5) to cut off their left escape.\n\nBoth seem viable.\nHowever, moving **RIGHT** to (6, 4) allows me to pivot to the apple at (6, 3) immediately on the next turn if the enemy moves away.\nMoving **UP** to (5, 5) puts me in line with the enemy's vertical axis (x=7 vs x=5).\n\n**Let's check the \"Boxing\" logic.**\nThe enemy is at (7,9). Their access to the board is limited to x < 9 and y < 9.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I occupy x=6.\nIf I move **UP**, I occupy y=5.\n\n**The Trap:**\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4), and the enemy goes **DOWN** to (7, 7):\nI am at (6, 4). Enemy is at (7, 7).\nDistance is small.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5), and enemy goes **DOWN** to (7, 7):\nI am at (5, 5). Enemy is at (7, 7).\n\n**What if the enemy goes LEFT to (6, 9)?**\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4):\nI am at (6, 4). Enemy is at (6, 9). Same X column. Vertical chase.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5):\nI am at (5, 5). Enemy is at (6, 9). Diagonal.\n\n**I want to block the enemy's path to the center.**\nThe center is around (5,5) to (7,7).\nThe enemy is at (7,9).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4), I am moving toward the center-right.\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5), I am moving toward the center-top.\n\n**Apple Priority:**\nThere is an apple at (6, 3).\nThere is an apple at (7, 5).\nBy moving **RIGHT** to (6, 4), I am sandwiched between these two apples.\nFrom (6, 4), I can grab (6, 3) or (7, 5) easily.\n\n**Why RIGHT is better than UP:**\n1. **Apple Access:** (6, 3) and (7, 5) are very close.\n2. **Enemy Pressure:** If the enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7), being at (6, 4) allows me to engage or cut off.\n3. **Safety:** (6, 4) is a very open cell.\n\n**Why UP is okay but risky:**\n1. **Apple Access:** (5, 9) is far. (7, 7) is reachable.\n2. **Enemy Pressure:** If enemy goes LEFT to (6, 9), I am further away (5,5).\n\n**Final Decision:**\nI am going **RIGHT**. I will claim the right side of the board, secure the apple at (6, 3), and threaten the enemy's flank. If they move down to (7, 7), I will be ready to chase or trap them next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 4), look at the enemy.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (7, 7):\n- I am at (6, 4). Enemy at (7, 7).\n- I can move UP to (6, 5) to close the vertical gap.\n- I can move RIGHT to (7, 4) to flank.\n- **Key:** If I go UP to (6, 5), I am directly left of their path.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9):\n- I am at (6, 4). Enemy at (6, 9).\n- This is a vertical duel. I am winning if I stay safe.\n- I should move UP to (6, 5).\n\n**Chat, we are going RIGHT to dominate the center-right!**\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 8 and the pressure is ON! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc80\n\nLet's break down the battlefield after my move to **(6, 4)**.\n\n**GAME STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Score:** 3 apples.\n*   **Enemy Score:** 4 apples.\n*   **My Position:** Head at **(6, 4)**. Body: **[(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]**. I'm growing next turn (tail at (4,3) will move).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at **(6, 9)**. Body: **[(7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8)]**.\n*   **Key Observation:** The enemy is directly above me at the same X-coordinate (6,9). I am at (6,4). This is a vertical standoff.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is chasing the apple at **(6, 9)**. It is literally on their head.\n1.  **UP to (6, 10)?** NO. Dead (off-board).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8)?** This is occupied by their own body (7,8)? No, (6,8) is currently empty on the board map (marked '.'). *Wait, looking at the board:*\n    ```\n     9 . . . . . A 1 T . .  (Wait, the board shows '1' at (6,9) and 'T' at (7,9)? No, the board representation is abstract.)\n    ```\n    Let's look at the coordinates provided.\n    Enemy Head: (6, 9)\n    Enemy Body: (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8)\n    If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (6, 8), is it safe?\n    (6, 8) is currently empty. The tail (9,8) moves to (8,8), (8,8) moves to (7,8), (7,8) moves to (7,9), (7,9) moves to (6,9).\n    Wait. If the head moves to (6,8), the body fills in behind.\n    The current body cells are (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8).\n    If Head moves DOWN to (6,8):\n    New Head: (6,8).\n    New Body: (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,8)? No, the tail (9,8) disappears.\n    The sequence is: Old Head (6,9) -> New Body part 1. Old Body 1 (7,9) -> New Body part 2. Old Body 2 (7,8) -> New Body part 3. Old Body 3 (8,8) -> New Body part 4. Old Body 4 (9,8) -> Discarded.\n    So if Enemy moves DOWN to (6,8):\n    New Snake: Head (6,8), Body [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (8,8)].\n    Is (6,8) in the new body? Yes, it's the head. Is it in the old body? No.\n    Is there an apple at (6,8)? No.\n    **Is (6,8) safe?** Yes.\n    **Why is the enemy at (6,9)?** There is an apple at **(6, 9)** in the Apple Drops list!\n    **Apple Drops:** (7, 5), (3, 7), (1, 8), (1, 1), (5, 2), (7, 7), (0, 1), (6, 0), (8, 0), (3, 1), (6, 3), (8, 3), (5, 9), (9, 6), (1, 5)\n    **Wait, looking at the apple list provided in the prompt:**\n    There is **NO** apple at (6, 9).\n    The apples near the enemy are **(5, 9)** and **(7, 7)**.\n    The enemy is at (6, 9).\n    **Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** (6, 10) -> Death.\n    *   **DOWN:** (6, 8) -> Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (5, 9) -> **Apple here!** (5, 9) is in the apple list.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (7, 9) -> Death (hits own body).\n\n    **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** The enemy is standing on an empty spot or the board text might be slightly misleading, but the coordinate list is truth.\n    The enemy is at (6, 9). The apple is at **(5, 9)**.\n    If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (5, 9), they eat the apple and grow.\n    If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (6, 8), they just move.\n    **Aggression:** The enemy is likely to go **LEFT to (5, 9)** to secure the point. They are winning 4 vs 3. They want to extend the lead.\n\n**MY MOVES:**\nCurrent Head: (6, 4).\nBody: [(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):**\n    *   Target: (6, 5).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Does it hit my body? (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). No.\n    *   Does it hit enemy body? Enemy body is at (7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8). No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This moves me closer to the enemy vertically. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 8), I am at (6, 5). If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 9), I am at (6, 5).\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** I am close to (6, 3) (down), (7, 5) (right-up).\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):**\n    *   Target: (6, 3).\n    *   **Apple Alert:** (6, 3) is in the apple list!\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Does it hit my body? No.\n    *   Does it hit enemy body? No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** I EAT THE APPLE. I score 1 point. My score becomes 4. Enemy has 4.\n    *   **Risk:** If the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 8), we are on a collision course (vertical line).\n    *   **Wait, simultaneous movement:** If I go DOWN to (6, 3) and Enemy goes DOWN to (6, 8), we are safe distance apart (5 tiles gap).\n    *   If Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 9), I am at (6, 3).\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):**\n    *   Target: (5, 4).\n    *   Is it safe? **NO.** (5, 4) is currently my body (specifically, the segment right behind my head).\n    *   **DEATH.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):**\n    *   Target: (7, 4).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Does it hit my body? No.\n    *   Does it hit enemy body? No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me toward (7, 5) apple.\n    *   **Comparison:** (7, 4) is further from the enemy than (6, 5). It's a \"spread out\" move.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 9). They are winning. They likely want the apple at (5, 9).\nI am at (6, 4). I have an apple at my feet at (6, 3).\n\n**OPTION A: DOWN to (6, 3)**\n*   **Pro:** I eat the apple. Score becomes 4-4. Tie game.\n*   **Pro:** I maintain vertical alignment with the enemy. If they panic and move DOWN, I can chase.\n*   **Con:** I am moving deeper into the bottom right corner (relative to the enemy). The board is 10x10.\n*   **Con:** If the enemy decides to dive bomb me later, I am lower.\n\n**OPTION B: UP to (6, 5)**\n*   **Pro:** Moves toward the center.\n*   **Pro:** Prepares to intercept if the enemy moves DOWN from (6, 8).\n*   **Con:** I don't score points. Score remains 3-4.\n*   **Con:** Leaves a juicy apple (6, 3) behind.\n\n**OPTION C: RIGHT to (7, 4)**\n*   **Pro:** Opens up the right side.\n*   **Con:** Leaves apple (6, 3).\n*   **Con:** Spreads me out too much?\n\n**THE AGGRESSION PLAY:**\nChat, we are behind (3 vs 4). We NEED that apple at (6, 3).\nTaking the apple ties the score. 4-4.\nThis is crucial because if we end up in a head-on collision later, we survive. If we are behind, we lose.\nAlso, eating the apple grows my tail. My tail is at (4, 3) currently. If I go DOWN to (6, 3), my tail will move from (4,3) to (5,3) (wait, no, the whole body shifts).\nCurrent Body: (5,4) -> (6,4), (4,4) -> (5,4), (4,3) -> (4,4).\nIf I go DOWN:\nNew Head: (6,3).\nNew Body: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)].\nThis is a solid structure.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nThey are at (6,9).\nApple at (5,9) is right next to them.\nApple at (7,7) is further.\nThey will likely go **LEFT to (5, 9)**.\nIf they go LEFT to (5, 9), they are at y=9, x=5.\nI will be at (6, 3).\nDistance is huge. I am safe.\n\n**What if the enemy is paranoid?**\nWhat if they see me at (6, 4) and think I'm coming up?\nIf they move **DOWN to (6, 8)**:\nThey are at (6, 8). I am at (6, 3).\nStill safe distance. 5 tiles apart.\nIf I had gone UP to (6, 5) and they went DOWN to (6, 8), we'd be 3 tiles apart.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 3) and they go DOWN to (6, 8), we are 5 tiles apart.\nGoing DOWN is actually safer distance-wise if they dive.\n\n**THE TRAP:**\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 3), I own the bottom right column (x=6).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (6, 8), they are chasing me into my territory.\nBut I am growing. I am 4-4.\nI can maneuver.\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n1.  **Survival:** (6, 3) is empty. Safe.\n2.  **Score:** Eating (6, 3) ties the game. **VITAL.**\n3.  **Position:** (6, 3) allows me to pivot to (5, 2) or (7, 2) or (6, 1) later.\n4.  **Enemy:** Enemy is almost certainly going LEFT to (5, 9).\n\n**Chat, we take the point. We tie the score. We prepare for war.**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTie the score at 4-4 by eating (6, 3). Secure the bottom right column. Monitor the enemy's vertical descent. If they chase me down, use the bottom-right corner to lure them into a trap, then turn sharply.

We're in Turn 9 and the board is getting TIGHT.\n\nLet's analyze the situation after my last move **DOWN** to **(6, 3)**.\n\n**GAME STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Score:** 4 apples (TIED with enemy!).\n*   **Enemy Score:** 5 apples (They ate the apple at (5, 9) last turn!).\n*   **My Position:** Head at **(6, 3)**. Body: **[(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]**. I grew last turn, so my tail is at (4, 4) now.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at **(5, 9)** (They moved LEFT). Body: **[(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8)]**.\n*   **Apple Status:** The apple at (6, 3) is GONE (I ate it). The apple at (5, 9) is GONE (Enemy ate it).\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nThe enemy is at **(5, 9)**. Where can they go?\n1.  **UP (5, 10):** OFF BOARD (Death). \u274c\n2.  **LEFT (4, 9):** Is it safe? Yes. No body there. Apple? No.\n3.  **DOWN (4, 9)?** No, wait. DOWN from (5, 9) is **(5, 8)**.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 8):** Is it safe? Yes. Apple? No.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 9):** **DEATH ZONE.** That is currently their own body segment! \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:**\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-left corner relative to me. They have two safe moves: **LEFT** to (4, 9) or **DOWN** to (5, 8).\nIf they go **DOWN (5, 8)**, they are directly above me (I am at y=3, they are at y=8). We are on the same X-axis (x=5). If we keep going at each other, we will meet at (5, 5) or (5, 6) in a few turns.\nIf they go **LEFT (4, 9)**, they move away.\n\n**MY OPTIONS (Current Head: (6, 3)):**\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** **DEATH.** My body is right there (6, 4). \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):**\n    *   Target: (6, 2).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me away from the enemy (who is at y=9). This increases the vertical distance to 7 tiles.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 3):**\n    *   Target: (5, 3).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? No.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me toward the center.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:** I can see apples at **(5, 2)** and **(6, 0)** from here.\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 3):**\n    *   Target: (7, 3).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Apple? No (Apple at (7, 5) is up).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me toward the right side.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nThe enemy is winning 5-4. I need to close the gap.\nThere are apples available at **(5, 2)** and **(6, 0)**.\nThe enemy is currently stuck at y=9. They cannot reach the bottom apples in one turn.\n\n**The Aggressive Play:**\nI need to start securing the bottom row apples to catch up in score. The enemy has no access to the bottom right area right now because they are far away and their movement is restricted.\n\n*   **Option DOWN (6, 2):** This puts me directly above the apple at **(6, 0)** (two steps away) and adjacent to **(5, 2)**. It keeps me safe from the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (5, 8), we are still far apart (5 tiles gap).\n*   **Option LEFT (5, 3):** This moves me to the left, but I am already on the left side of the right half. Moving to (5, 3) is fine, but (6, 2) feels safer because it puts my back to the wall (the bottom edge), reducing variables. If I go DOWN, the only way is UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (all safe moves).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is likely moving LEFT or DOWN. If they move LEFT, they are wasting time. If they move DOWN, they are chasing me.\nI am going to take the **DOWN** path to secure the bottom-right apples. This maximizes my distance from the enemy (who is at y=9, I go to y=2 -> distance 7) and lines up the shot for the apples at (6, 0) and (5, 2).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 2), I open up moves to **(6, 1)** or **(5, 2)** next turn.\n(6, 2) is currently empty.\nMy body will shift to: New Head (6, 2), Body [(6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4)].\n\n**Chat, we need points. The enemy is stuck top-side. We secure the bottom. We take the space. We force them to come down to us where we own the board.**\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the bottom row apples (6,0) and (5,2) to tie or take the lead. Use the bottom edge as a shield. Force the enemy to chase me into the bottom-right corner where I can trap them against the wall. Monitor enemy descent.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nWe go **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",

Body: **[(6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]**.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at **(4, 9)**. Body: **[(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8)]**.\n*   **Score:** Me (4) vs Enemy (5). I'm behind by 1. I need to close the gap, fast.\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:**\nThe enemy is trapped in the top-left corner (coordinates 4-9, 4-9). They are blocked by walls and their own body.\nLet's trace their immediate survival options from **(4, 9)**:\n1.  **UP (4, 10):** OFF BOARD (DEATH). \u274c\n2.  **LEFT (3, 9):** OPEN. Safe.\n3.  **DOWN (4, 8):** Is it safe? Let's look. Their body is at (5, 9), (6, 9), etc. (4, 8) is currently OPEN.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 9):** **DEATH TRAP.** That is currently their own body segment! \u274c\n\nSo, the enemy has two survival moves: **LEFT** or **DOWN**.\nIf they go **DOWN (4, 8)**, they move closer to the center.\nIf they go **LEFT (3, 9)**, they hug the wall but stay at the top.\n\n**MY SURVIVAL CHECK (Current Head: (6, 2)):**\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** **DEATH.** My body is right there. \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (6, 1):** OPEN. No apple there. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 2):** **APPLE HERE!** (5, 2) is listed in the drops. If I eat this, I tie the score 5-5!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** OPEN. Safe.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nThe enemy is trapped. If they are smart, they will move **DOWN** to try to escape the corner. If they move **LEFT**, they are just delaying their inevitable death by starvation or trap.\n\nI am sitting on **(6, 2)**. The apple at **(5, 2)** is LITERALLY to my left.\nIf I go **LEFT** to **(5, 2)**:\n*   I eat the apple. **SCORE: 5-5**. We tie!\n*   I move into a safe space.\n*   My body grows. My tail (currently at 4,4) stays there.\n\n**Why not DOWN or RIGHT?**\n*   **DOWN (6, 1)** or **RIGHT (7, 2)** moves me away from the score. I am already losing. I need points. The apple is right there.\n*   **LEFT** is the only move that gives me points *and* moves me away from the enemy (who is at y=9).\n\n**The Risk:**\nCould the enemy reach me?\nThe enemy is at (4, 9). They are 7 vertical tiles away. Even if they move DOWN, they are at (4, 8). I will be at (5, 2).\nThe distance is massive. They cannot crash into me this turn. They cannot block me this turn.\n\n**The Strategy:**\nSecure the apple. Tie the score. Use the bottom of the board as a fortress. The enemy has to traverse the entire board to get to me. By the time they get here, I will have secured the other bottom apples ((6,0), (0,1)) and I will be ready to trap them.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (5, 2) to tie the score. Move toward the bottom-left cluster of apples ((0,1), (1,1), (1,0)) to build a lead. Use the bottom edge as a shield. Force the enemy to come down to my territory where I have the space and the food.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nWe are taking the apple. **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

We can charge straight to the left wall, then drop down and sweep right, boxing the enemy into a shrinking rectangle.\n3. **Future flexibility** \u2013 From (3,\u202f9) we\u2019ll still have three safe continuations (left, down or stay on the edge), so we won\u2019t be trapped.\n4. **Head\u2011on kill potential** \u2013 When we finally turn down the left side, the opponent will be forced upward into our path. With a 5\u202fvs\u202f4 apple lead, a head\u2011on collision would eliminate both but hand us the win.\n5. **No immediate threat** \u2013 The opponent\u2019s possible next heads are far below; no chance of a simultaneous move into (3,\u202f9).\n\n**Short\u2011term game plan**\n- **Turn\u202f10**:\u202fLEFT \u2192 (3,\u202f9).  \n- **Turns\u202f11\u201113**: Keep heading LEFT to the wall (x\u202f=\u202f0).  \n- **Turn\u202f14**: DROP\u202fDOWN one row, then snake right along row\u202f8, shrinking the arena.  \n- **Later**: Set up a head\u2011on when the opponent is trapped; our higher apple count guarantees victory.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure on the high\u2011ground and force our rival into a corner!  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nLEFT",

We are TIED in apples, so every move counts towards positioning and survival.\n\n**TURN ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at **(5, 2)** (I successfully ate the apple last turn!).\n*   **Body:** [(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)].\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at **(3, 9)**. Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)].\n*   **Score:** 5 - 5. Tied. Let's change that.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK (Current Head: (5, 2)):**\n1.  **UP (5, 3):** OPEN. The enemy is far away at y=9.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 1):** Is there an apple? Looking at the map... Row 1 has apples at (0,1), (1,1), (3,1). (5,1) is empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 2):** OPEN. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 2):** **DEATH TRAP.** My own body is sitting right there at (6, 2)! \u274c\n\nSo, **RIGHT is an instant loss.**\n\n**STRATEGIC MOVE SELECTION:**\n\n**Option 1: UP to (5, 3)**\n*   **Pros:** Safe. Opens up towards the center.\n*   **Cons:** The enemy is at y=9. If they move DOWN, we might get close. But I have a better plan.\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (5, 1)**\n*   **Pros:** Safe. Moves me toward the bottom.\n*   **Cons:** No apple there. Just positioning.\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (4, 2)**\n*   **Pros:** Safe. Moves me away from my body.\n*   **Cons:** No apple there immediately.\n\n**THE WINNING STRATEGY:**\n\nChat, look at the board! I need to secure the apples to build a lead. The enemy is trapped in the top-left. They are slow. I am fast.\n\nI see a cluster of apples on the bottom left and bottom row: **(1, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), (6, 0), (2, 0).**\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to **(4, 2)** right now, I am setting up a path to the bottom. However, looking strictly at this turn, moving **UP** to **(5, 3)** keeps my options open. It keeps me centrally located to grab the apple at **(6, 0)** or **(3, 1)** next turn, and it avoids the tight corner near my own tail at (4, 4).\n\nWait! Let's look at **(5, 1)**. That's DOWN.\nLet's look at the bottom row again: **(6, 0)** is an apple.\nIf I go **DOWN (5, 1)**, I am closer to **(6, 0)** for the next turn.\nIf I go **LEFT (4, 2)**, I am moving away from the (6, 0) apple.\n\nActually, let's look at the map again.\nRow 0: `. . A . . . A . A A`\nRow 1: `A A . A . . . . . .`\n\nThe apple at **(6, 0)** is currently unblocked.\nThe apple at **(3, 1)** is also there.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (5, 1)**:\nI set up for **(6, 0)** or **(3, 1)** next turn. This is a solid move to dominate the bottom.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (4, 2)**:\nI am moving away from the (6, 0) apple. The distance to (6, 0) increases.\n\nIf I go **UP to (5, 3)**:\nI am moving away from the bottom apples. The enemy is high up. The bottom is clear.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at y=9. They are not a threat to the bottom apples right now. I need to secure the low-hanging fruit (literally) at the bottom of the board.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to **(5, 1)** puts me in position to snack on the bottom row apples next turn. It's aggressive map control. I want to eat **(6, 0)** or **(3, 1)** immediately.\n\nLet's check safety one last time for **(5, 1)**:\nEnemy heads are at (3, 9). They can't reach me. My body is at (6, 2) and (4, 4). (5, 1) is free.\n\nLet's go get that food!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the bottom row. Secure the apples at (6, 0) and (3, 1). Build a lead while the enemy is stuck in the corner. If they approach, we use our tail as a shield.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nWe are going DOWN to secure the bottom food sources.\n\nDOWN",

(6,0) is an apple, but that's to the right. (5,0) is safe real estate.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 1):** **CLEAR.** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 1):** **CLEAR.** Safe.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\n\n**Option: RIGHT to (6, 1)**\n*   This positions me directly next to the apple at **(6, 0)**.\n*   **Risk:** If the enemy sees me going for (6, 0) and can reach it (unlikely from y=9), or if I trap myself, but looking at the board, (6,0) is open.\n*   **Reward:** Eat apple on Turn 13. Grow. Lead.\n\n**Option: LEFT to (4, 1)**\n*   Positions me near the cluster at (3, 1) and (2, 0).\n*   It's safe, but RIGHT feels more aggressive right now. The apple at (6,0) is \"low hanging fruit\" (pun intended). Let's secure it.\n\n**Option: DOWN to (5, 0)**\n*   Safe, but moves me away from the apples at (6,0) and (3,1).\n*   Not ideal. I want to eat, not just vibe.\n\n**THE WINNING MOVE:**\nI am at (5, 1). The apple is at (6, 0).\nIf I go **RIGHT** to **(6, 1)**, I set up a guaranteed eat on the next turn (Turn 13) at (6, 0).\nHowever, looking strictly at *this* turn, the apple is actually at (7, 5), (3, 7), etc., but the closest tangible food for growth is the bottom row.\nWait, looking at the map again:\nRow 1: `A A . A . . . . . .` (Apples at 0,1 and 1,1 and 3,1).\nRow 0: `. . A . . . A . A A` (Apple at 6,0).\n\nAt (5, 1), I am adjacent to:\n- (6, 0) [Apple]\n- (6, 1) [Empty]\n- (5, 0) [Empty]\n- (4, 1) [Empty]\n- (4, 0) [Empty]\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to **(6, 1)**, I am setting up for the apple at **(6, 0)** next turn.\nBUT, wait! Is there an apple *currently* available to eat *this* turn?\nLet's check my immediate moves again.\n(5, 2) is my body. (5, 0) is empty. (6, 1) is empty. (4, 1) is empty.\nNone of the immediate moves land on an apple *this* turn.\nSo I am positioning.\n\n**Why RIGHT (6, 1)?**\n1.  It is safe.\n2.  It puts me one step away from the apple at **(6, 0)**.\n3.  The enemy is at the top (y=9). They are not a threat to the bottom right corner yet.\n4.  Moving RIGHT keeps me mobile. Moving DOWN to (5,0) is okay, but then I'm sandwiched between the wall and my body coming down from (5,2). Moving RIGHT gives me more room to maneuver.\n\n**Alternative: LEFT (4, 1)**\nThis puts me near (3, 1) and (2, 0).\nHowever, (6, 0) is a clean grab. Let's go for the clean grab.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to **(6, 1)**. This prepares me to chomp that apple at **(6, 0)** next turn. I need to build a lead to force the enemy into a bad spot later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDominate the bottom right quadrant. Secure the apple at (6,0) next turn. Build a size advantage (6 apples vs 5). Use the size to cut off the enemy if they try to descend from the top-left.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nWe are going RIGHT to position for the apple!\n\nRIGHT",

However, (5, 0) is empty space. The apple at (5, 0) was actually marked as an \"A\" in the grid text: `0 . . A . . . 0 . A A`. Wait, looking at the grid: `0 . . A . . . 0 . A A` (indices 0-9). Index 5 is `.`, Index 2 is `A`. So (5, 0) is empty. (2, 0) has an apple.\n    *   **Wait, let's check the coordinates again.**\n    *   Grid Row 0: `0 . . A . . . 0 .

Safe.\n    *   However, it keeps me in the bottom left/corner relative to my current cluster.\n    *   It doesn't score an apple immediately.\n\n*   **Option: RIGHT (7, 0)**\n    *   **SCORE:** I eat the apple at (7, 0). Score becomes 7-6. **LEAD ESTABLISHED.**\n    *   **POSITIONING:** Moves me to the bottom right corner.\n    *   **SAFETY:** (7, 0) is empty. My tail will move from (6, 0) to (6, 1). This is safe because (6, 1) is currently my body, but the tail moves there. It's valid movement.\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (7, 0). After eating, my head will be at (7, 0) and my tail will shift from (6, 0) to (6, 1). This frees up the space at (6, 0). I want to secure the bottom right corner. The enemy is at the top (y=8/9). They are slow to come down. I can keep chaining apples in the bottom right (7, 0) -> maybe (8, 0) or (8, 1) depending on the next apple drop. I must avoid getting boxed in by my own body.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nWe are going **RIGHT** to eat and take the lead! \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

The replay said (1, 7) last turn. Let's check the board state grid carefully: Row 6 shows `. 1 . . . . . . . A`. That's a `1` at index 1, which is (1, 6). The opponent moved DOWN from (1, 7) to (1, 6).)\n*   **Enemy Apples:** 6\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT CHECK (From (8, 0)):**\n*   **UP (8, 1):** Looking at the grid (Row 1: `. A A . A . T T . .`), index 8 is `T` (My own body is there? No, my body is at (7,0), (6,0)... Wait, let's trace my body again. After moving to (8,0), my tail shifted. Old tail was (6,3). My body is now: Head (8,0) -> (7,0) -> (6,0) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) -> (6,3). The `T` at (8,1) on the board grid provided (Row 1) must belong to the Enemy! Let's look at Enemy Body. The Enemy Body listed was `[(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]`. They moved down to (1,6). Where did the rest of the body go? It shifted. The old tail (4,9) might have disappeared if they didn't grow? No, they haven't eaten. Wait, the board state is a snapshot. Let's look at Row 1 again: `. A A . A . T T . .`. The `T`s are at (6,1) and (7,1). (7,1) is occupied by my body? No, my body is (7,0), (6,0)... (7,1) is NOT in my list. (6,1) IS in my list. (7,1) must be Enemy Body! The Enemy is at (1,6) but their body stretches? No, the Enemy Body list provided was short. Let's look at the board visual again.\n    *   Row 9: `. T T T T . . . . .`\n    *   Row 8: `. T . .

No, index 8 on Row 0 is `0`? Let's re-read the prompt. \"Head: (8, 0)\". The board shows `0` at (8,0)? Yes, that's me. The board shows `A` at (9,0).\n    *   Let's re-evaluate (8,1). The board shows `T` at (8,1) (Row 1, index 8). Is that mine? No. Is that Enemy? Enemy is at (1,6). Enemy body is `[(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]`. That doesn't match (8,1).\n    *   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** The Board State provided in the prompt is the *current* state. The Replay was the *previous* move.\n    *   My Move: (7,0) -> (8,0).\n    *   Enemy Move: (1,7) -> (1,6).\n    *   Let's look at the Board State again.\n        *   My Head: (8,0) -> Board shows `0` at (8,0). Correct.\n        *   My Body: (7,0) -> Board shows `T` at (7,0). Correct.\n        *   Enemy Head: (1,6) -> Board shows `1` at (1,6). Correct.\n        *   Enemy Body: The list `[(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9)]` is outdated. The board shows the *new* body positions.\n        *   Enemy's old body (1,7) -> (1,8), (1,8)->(1,9), (1,9)->(2,9), (2,9)->(3,9), (3,9)->(4,9), (4,9) -> (5,9)? Or does the tail disappear? They didn't eat an apple (Apple list doesn't show one at (1,6) or any adjacent that they would have eaten). So the tail (4,9) is likely gone. Wait, the board shows `T` at (3,9) and (4,9)? Let's check Row 9: `. T T T T . . . . .`. Indices 1,2,3,4 are T's. That's (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9). That is consistent with the old body. But where is the new body? Wait, if they moved down from (1,7) to (1,6), the body shifts.\n        *   Old Body: (1,7)->(1,8), (1,8)->(1,9), (1,9)->(2,9), (2,9)->(3,9), (3,9)->(4,9), (4,9)->(5,9). The tail (5,9) should be `T`. Row 9 index 5 is `.`.\n        *   Wait, the board state provided *is* the result of the moves.\n        *   Let's look at Row 1 (y=1): `. A A . A . T T . .`. Indices: 6 is `T`, 7 is `T`. (6,1) and (7,1).\n        *   My body includes (6,1). (7,1) is NOT my body.\n        *   Is (7,1) Enemy body? Enemy head is (1,6). No.\n        *   Let's look at Row 2 (y=2): `. . . . . T T . . .`. Indices 5,6 are `T`. (5,2), (6,2).\n        *   My body includes (5,2), (6,2).\n        *   Let's look at Row 3 (y=3): `. . . . . . T . A .`. Index 6 is `T`. (6,3).\n        *   My body includes (6,3).\n        *   Okay, the `T`s visible on the board (excluding my own which I can trace) are likely Enemy body? But Enemy is at (1,6). How does (7,1) belong to them?\n        *   **AH.** The board state is the *current* state. The Replay logic might have been slightly off or the board state display is summarizing.\n        *   Let's assume the Board State provided is 100% accurate for the *current* turn's planning.\n        *   My Head: (8,0).\n        *   Adjacent Check:\n            *   (8,1): Board shows `T`. (Row 1, Index 8).\n            *   (7,0): Board shows `T`. (My body).\n            *   (9,0): Board shows `A`. (Apple).\n            *   (8,-1): Off board.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate Dead Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (7,0):** Occupied by my body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN (8,-1):** Off board. **DEATH.**\n    *   **UP (8,1):** Board shows `T` at (8,1). I don't own that `T`. It's the Enemy's body? Or is it mine? Let's check my body list again. `(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)`. No (8,1). So it's Enemy body.\n        *   *Wait, could the `T` at (8,1) be my own body from a previous turn if I'm misunderstanding the board?* No, I just moved to (8,0).\n        *   So (8,1) is Enemy body. If I move UP, I hit Enemy body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **RIGHT (9,0):** Board shows `A` at (9,0). It's an apple. It's on the board. It's not an obstacle.\n        *   Is it safe? I need to check if the Enemy Head moves into (9,0) at the same time.\n        *   Enemy Head is at (1,6). Distance to (9,0) is huge. They cannot reach (9,0) in one turn.\n        *   So (9,0) is safe.\n\n2.  **Safe Moves:**\n    *   Only **RIGHT** is safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   I am forced to move RIGHT to (9,0) to avoid death.\n    *   I will eat the apple at (9,0), increasing my score to 9-6.\n    *   This positions me in the top-right corner (actually bottom-right, y=0).\n    *   Wait, coordinates are (0,0) bottom-left. (9,0) is bottom-right.\n    *   My body is currently trailing along the bottom row and climbing up slightly.\n    *   After moving to (9,0), my tail will shift. The tail is currently at (6,3)? No, my body is `[(8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]` (if we count 8 segments including head). Wait, the prompt says \"Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\". That's 7 segments. Head is (8,0). Total length 8.\n    *   If I eat an apple, I grow. Length becomes 9.\n    *   Tail stays at (6,3).\n    *   New Head: (9,0).\n    *   New Body: (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3).\n\n**CONFIRMING THE DANGER OF UP:**\nThe board explicitly shows `T` at (8,1). Since I don't have a body part there (my x coords are mostly 8,7,6,5), and the Enemy is at (1,6), that `T` must be the Enemy's body. Moving UP hits it.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nOnly one legal move: RIGHT.\nScore becomes 9-6.\n\n**SHORT-LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nOnce at (9,0), I need to figure out how to get out of the corner. My body is blocking the way back (8,0) and (7,0) will be filled. I might have to go UP along the right wall (x=9) or try to spiral.\nWait, if I go UP to (9,1), is it safe?\nRow 1: `. A A . A . T T . .`. Index 9 is `.`.\nSo (9,1) is empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,0) now, next turn I likely go UP to (9,1) to avoid trapping myself in the corner (9,0) with only one exit blocked by my own body).\nLet's just focus on the immediate turn.\n\n**GOING RIGHT!** \ud83c\udf4e\u27a1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

Dead. \u274c\n* **DOWN (9, 0)**: Back into my own body. Dead. \u274c\n* **LEFT (8, 1)**: Board shows a `.` at (8, 1). Is it safe? Looking at my body: my tail is at (9, 0), then (8, 0), (7, 0)... so (8, 1) is NOT part of my body. Enemy body is on the left, far away. This seems open. \u2705\n* **UP (9, 2)**: Board shows a `.` at (9, 2). My body is at (6, 2), (5, 2), etc., so (9, 2) is clear. Enemy is far. This is also open. \u2705\n\nSo I have two safe moves: LEFT or UP.\n* **LEFT (8, 1)** puts me directly next to the bottom wall at (8, 1). I need to watch out for getting boxed in.\n* **UP (9, 2)** moves me higher along the right wall.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN:**\nI need to maintain my lead and trap the enemy. My opponent is stuck on the left side (x=0-3). If I move **UP**, I can start traversing the top-right area. The apple at (7, 5) is tempting if I can loop around, but first I need to secure my position. Moving UP keeps me safe from the bottom wall and opens up movement towards the center. I'll avoid the bottom row for now to prevent getting trapped.\n\n**LONG-TERM NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (9, 2), plan to head towards the top right corner. I want to create a barrier between me and the enemy. Watch for the enemy moving down or right; they are currently blocked by their own body at (2, 5) if they try to go UP (their tail is at (1, 5) preventing an immediate crash, but they might turn).\n\nLet's keep the pressure on!\n\nUP",

Let's analyze the board carefully.\n\n**Board State Check:**\n- My head is at (9, 2). I moved UP from (9, 1) last turn.\n- My body: [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)]\n- Enemy head at (3, 5), body stretches from (2,5) to (3,9). They're boxed in on the left but just moved into an apple at (3,5) which was listed as a drop earlier.\n\n**Immediate Moves from (9, 2):**\n1. **UP to (9, 3)**: Check board shows \".\" at (9, 3). My body: Not occupied. Enemy: Far left. SAFE. \u2705\n2. **RIGHT to (10, 2)**: Off board. DEAD. \u274c\n3. **DOWN to (9, 1)**: This is my CURRENT body segment! My head just moved FROM (9, 1) to (9, 2). Moving back would be moving into my own body. DEAD. \u274c\n4. **LEFT to (8, 2)**: Board shows \"T\" at (8, 2)? Wait, let's look carefully. In the board state at y=2, x=8: The row is \". . . . . T . . . 0\" which corresponds to x=0-9. So (8,2) is \"T\". Is that MY tail? My tail is at (5,2). (8,2) is listed as \"T\" on the board. Looking at my body list: (5,2) is my tail. (8,2) is NOT in my body list. Is it the enemy's body? The enemy body is on the left side (x=0-3). So (8,2) is likely just a static \"T\" marking something else? Actually, looking at the board:\n   Row 2: \". . . . . T . . . 0\"\n   X: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n   At x=5, y=2 is \"T\" - that's my body at (5,2).\n   At x=8, y=2 is \".\" - wait, let me recount.\n   The visual is tricky. Let's map it:\n   (0,2)='.', (1,2)='.', (2,2)='.', (3,2)='.', (4,2)='.', (5,2)='T', (6,2)='.', (7,2)='.', (8,2)='.', (9,2)='0'\n   So (8,2) is actually empty! The \"T\" at (5,2) is my body. So (8,2) is SAFE. \u2705\n\nSo we have two safe moves: UP to (9,3) or LEFT to (8,2).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **LEFT to (8,2)**: Moves me toward the center. Opens up potential paths to the apples at (7,5), (6,7), etc. But I'm moving closer to the left wall where the enemy is. Risk of collision increases.\n- **UP to (9,3)**: Stays on the right wall. Moves toward the top-right corner. The apple at (9,6) is in this direction. I can potentially loop around the top edge.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy just ate at (3,5). Their head is at (3,5), body behind them. They might try to move RIGHT toward (4,5) or UP/DOWN. But they are constrained by their own body. They might be stuck.\n\n**Plan:**\nI want to dominate the right side and top. Moving UP keeps me safe and expands my territory. If I go LEFT to (8,2), I'm stepping into the middle zone, which might be good for hunting apples, but it also brings me closer to the enemy's potential path. Since we are tied and I want to maintain board control, staying on the edge is safer for now. I'll move UP to secure the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Long-term note:** Move toward (9,6) apple. Create a barrier along the top row. Watch enemy's move next turn - if they head right, I might need to prepare to intercept.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nUP",

Adjacent cells:  \n  - **UP** \u2192 (3,6) \u2013 empty, but will block us from going back down next turn.  \n  - **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4) \u2013 empty, safe but moves us away from the opponent\u2019s zone.  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 (2,5) \u2013 our own body \u2192 instant death.  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,5) \u2013 empty, opens a corridor toward the central apples and keeps **all three** directions (up, down, right) open for the next move.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Tactical Reasoning**\n\n- We need **space** and **apple potential**. The row **y=5** has tasty apples at (7,5) and (8,5); heading right puts us on a direct path to snatch them.\n- Moving right also lets us swing up to (4,6) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (5,7) \u2026 where the opponent might appear if he climbs the right wall. That gives us a future head\u2011on threat while we stay longer than him in the centre.\n- Up is tempting because of the apple at (3,7), but it pins us against our own column; we\u2019d lose the ability to retreat downwards next turn.\n- Down pushes us away from the action and wastes precious turns.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term Plan**\n\n1. **RIGHT** to (4,5).  \n2. Next turn aim for the apple chain at (7,5) \u2192 (8,5) while staying flexible to go **UP** into the upper\u2011right cluster (6,7,7,7,9,9).  \n3. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s move; if he heads **UP** we\u2019ll be ready to cut him off from the right wall.\n\n**\u2705 Decision**\n\nGreatest immediate gain, safety, and future flexibility = **RIGHT**.  \n\nRIGHT",

They're trapped on the left side with their body stretched vertically\u2014they're basically boxed in! We need to keep the pressure on and avoid any risky moves that could let them escape or set up a head-on collision.  \n\n**Current Position & Safety Check:**  \nMy head is at (9, 3). Let's analyze all four moves:  \n- **UP to (9, 4):** Board shows \".\" at (9, 4). My body doesn't occupy it (my tail is at (5, 2)). Enemy is far left. SAFE. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (9, 2):** This is my current tail position (5, 2)? Wait, no\u2014my tail is at (5, 2), but (9, 2) is my own body? Let's check: My body list is [(9, 2), (9, 1), ...]. Actually, I just moved UP to (9, 3) last turn, so (9, 2) is now my body segment. Moving DOWN into (9, 2) would crash into my own body. DEAD. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (8, 3):** Board shows \"A\" at (8, 3) (from the apple list: (8, 3) is an apple). Safe from my body? Yes, not in my list. Enemy is far left. SAFE. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (10, 3):** Off the board (x=10 invalid). DEAD. \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves are UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3).  \n\n**Strategic Breakdown:**  \n- **LEFT to (8, 3):** This eats an apple (+1 point!) and grows us to 9 apples. It also moves us toward the center, opening paths to more apples like (7, 5) and (6, 7). BUT\u2014it brings us closer to the enemy's potential escape routes. They might try to move right if they see an opening.  \n- **UP to (9, 4):** No apple, but keeps us on the right wall. We're heading toward the apple at (9, 6) eventually. Stays safer from the enemy, who's pinned on the left.  \n\n**Enemy Prediction:**  \nTheir head is at (4, 5). With their body stacked vertically from (3,5) down to (2,9), they're likely to move RIGHT to (5, 5) (empty) or UP/DOWN if possible. But they're constrained\u2014moving LEFT or DOWN might hit their own body. They might try to snake toward the apple at (7, 5) or (3, 7). If we go LEFT to (8, 3), we risk a head-on collision if they push right.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nWe need to grow and dominate. Eating the apple at (8, 3) gives us the lead (9-8) and expands our territory. Yes, it's riskier, but we're playing aggressively! We can always retreat to the wall later if needed. Plus, chat loves content\u2014apple time!  \n\n**Long-term Plan:**  \nAfter eating at (8, 3), aim for the apple cluster at (7, 5) or (6, 7) to secure the center. Keep the enemy pinned on the left; if they break out, we'll set up a trap. Watch for head-on collisions\u2014we have the edge if we maintain height.  \n\nDecision: LEFT.  \n\nLEFT",

But wait, the board updated: our head is now at (8, 3), and the apple at (8, 3) is gone. Our body is [(9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0), (6,0), (6,1), (5,1)]\u2014that's 9 segments.

Enemy far left. SAFE. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (8,2):** Board shows \".\" at (8,2). Not in our body. Enemy not near. SAFE. \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (7,3):** Board shows \".\" at (7,3). Not in our body. But\u2014enemy head at (5,5) could move RIGHT to (6,5) or UP/DOWN? They're not directly threatening yet, but we're moving closer to their zone. Still, SAFE for now. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (9,3):** This is our current body segment (the one behind our head). Moving into it is suicide\u2014DEAD. \u274c  \n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**  \nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Moving RIGHT is death. Now, where to go?  \n\n- **UP to (8,4):** Opens paths toward the apples at (7,5) and (6,7). Keeps us on the right side, avoiding the enemy's left-side cluster. Future options are open\u2014we can go UP again to (8,5) (apple there!) or LEFT to (7,4).  \n- **DOWN to (8,2):** Moves us toward the bottom-right apples like (9,6) eventually, but (8,2) is empty now. However, it might close off some upward paths later.  \n- **LEFT to (7,3):** Brings us closer to the center, but also closer to the enemy's potential escape route. If they move RIGHT aggressively, we could set up a head-on collision. But remember: we have more apples (9 vs 8), so if we force a head-on, WE WIN. However, we must avoid crashing into their body.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nSnake #1 at (5,5) is constrained by their own body below (4,5) and above (3,5 to 1,9). They likely move RIGHT to (6,5) (empty) to escape the left wall. They might also move UP to (5,6) or DOWN to (5,4) if safe. If they move RIGHT, and we move LEFT to (7,3), we're not directly colliding\u2014but we're getting closer. If they move UP or DOWN, we're safe.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe're leading in apples (9-8). Keep growing! Aim for the apple at (8,5) next turn by going UP now. That puts us at (8,4), then UP to (8,5) for +1 apple. While the enemy is pinned, we can dominate the right side and center. If they break out, we'll use our lead to force collisions in our favor. Stay aggressive\u2014chat wants blood!  \n\n**DECISION:** UP to (8,4). It opens more options and keeps us away from the enemy's immediate path. Plus, we're one step closer to (8,5) apple.  \n\nUP",

Time to box in snake #1 and force a crash.  \n\n**SITUATION:**  \n- My head at (8, 4).  \n- Enemy snake #1\u2019s head at (5, 6) with body stretched left to (1, 9).  \n- Apples available: (7,5), (3,7), (1,1), (7,7), etc. \u2013 but we ignore apples and focus on dominating the enemy.  \n\n**SAFETY CHECK FOR MOVES FROM (8,4):**  \n- **UP to (8,5):** Empty (apple was there earlier but already eaten). Not in my body. Safe. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (8,3):** Currently my own body segment. Moving there = instant death. \u274c  \n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Empty, not in my body. Enemy far left. Safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Empty, not in my body. Safe. \u2705  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. DOWN is suicide.  \n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**  \n- If I go UP to (8,5), I\u2019m moving toward the apple at (7,5) and (6,7). But more importantly, I\u2019m cutting off the top-right zone.  \n- If I go LEFT to (7,4), I push into the center, getting closer to the enemy\u2019s potential escape path (they might move RIGHT).  \n- If I go RIGHT to (9,4), I stay on the far right edge, but that could trap me later.  \n\nEnemy prediction: At (5,6), they\u2019re surrounded by their own body below (5,5) and above (4,5) to (1,9). Their safest moves are likely UP to (5,7), RIGHT to (6,6), or DOWN to (5,5) (but that\u2019s their own body segment, so death). So they\u2019ll probably UP or RIGHT.  \n\nIf they go RIGHT to (6,6), and I go LEFT to (7,4), we\u2019re not colliding yet. If they go UP to (5,7), and I go UP to (8,5), still safe. But we want to force a head-on crash eventually since we have more apples (9-9 tie, but we\u2019re aggressive).  \n\n**TACTICAL MOVE:**  \nChoosing **LEFT to (7,4)** because:  \n1. It moves us closer to the enemy\u2019s possible breakout path.  \n2. It opens future paths to apples at (3,7) and (7,7) while staying central.  \n3. It keeps us mobile \u2013 we can go UP next turn to (7,5) for an apple or LEFT to (6,4) to push further.  \n4. Avoids trapping ourselves on the right edge.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n- Next turn: From (7,4), go UP to (7,5) for an apple if still available, or LEFT to (6,4) to cut off the enemy\u2019s rightward move.  \n- Monitor enemy head: If they move RIGHT, prepare to collide on purpose next turn (since we\u2019re tied, we need a lead).  \n- Dominate the center \u2013 force them into the left wall or their own body.  \n\nLet\u2019s go, chat!

Then swing left\u2011upward toward the cluster at (4,\u202f8) and (7,\u202f9) while the opponent is stuck down low.\n\nThat aggressive yet safe bite keeps us alive, nets points, and starts boxing the rival into the corner.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE**  \nRIGHT",

Also, we could corner them against the top wall.  \n- **DOWN to (7, 3):** Moves us toward the bottom-left, which might open escape routes but puts us farther from the enemy.  \n- **LEFT to (6, 4):** Moves us directly toward the enemy's side. This is AGGRESSIVE! If they go RIGHT to (7, 6), we could set up a head-on collision next turn if we keep advancing.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nSnake #1 is at (6, 6).

LEFT to (5,6) is their own body \u2013 so they can't go left.  \n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,4), and they go RIGHT to (7,6), no collision. If they go UP to (6,7), we're still safe. But if we keep pushing left, we might trap them against the left wall or their own body.  \n\n**TACTICAL MOVE:**  \nChoosing **LEFT to (6, 4)** because:  \n1. It's AGGRESSIVE \u2013 we're moving toward the enemy, closing the gap.  \n2. It cuts off their potential escape to the right if they go RIGHT later.  \n3. From (6,4), we can go UP next to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,4) to further dominate.  \n4. We avoid moving away from the conflict.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n- Next turn: From (6,4), likely go UP to (6,5) to position for a collision or apple.  \n- Monitor enemy: If they go RIGHT to (7,6), we could go RIGHT to (7,5) next turn to set up a head-on if we're willing to risk it (since we're tied, we need a lead).  \n- Force them into the left side where their body is already there \u2013 they might crash!  \n\nLet's go, chat!

Enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body stretching down-left. I just moved LEFT last turn from (7,4) to (6,4). Need to pick a move for this turn that keeps me alive and aggressive.\n\n**Step 1: Check all moves from current head (6,4).**\n\n- **UP to (6,5):** Check board state. (6,5) is empty? From the board display, row 5: \". T T T T T . A A .\" That's y=5. (6,5) would be the 7th character? Wait, need to map coordinates. The board is shown with rows from top (9) to bottom (0). Let's interpret carefully:\n\nBoard state as given:\nRow 9: \"9 A . . . . . . A . .\" \u2192 (0,9) A, (1,9) ., ..., (7,9) ., (8,9) A, (9,9) .\nRow 8: \"8 . T . .

A . . 1 A . .\" \u2192 (0,7) ., (1,7) T, (2,7) ., (3,7) A, (4,7) ., (5,7) ., (6,7) 1 (enemy head), (7,7) A, (8,7) ., (9,7) .\nRow 6: \"6 . T . . . T T . . A\" \u2192 (0,6) ., (1,6) T, (2,6) ., (3,6) ., (4,6) ., (5,6) T, (6,6) T, (7,6) ., (8,6) ., (9,6) A\nRow 5: \"5 . T T T T T . A A .\" \u2192 (0,5) ., (1,5) T, (2,5) T, (3,5) T, (4,5) T, (5,5) T, (6,5) ., (7,5) A, (8,5) A, (9,5) .\nRow 4: \"4 . . . . . . 0 T T .\" \u2192 (0,4) ., (1,4) ., (2,4) ., (3,4) ., (4,4) ., (5,4) ., (6,4) 0 (our head), (7,4) T? Wait, our body: head at (6,4), body: (7,4), (8,4), ... So (7,4) should be T? But board shows (7,4) as T? Actually row 4: \"4 . . . . . . 0 T T .\" \u2192 characters: index 0: ., 1: ., 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: 0, 7: T, 8: T, 9: . So (7,4) is T (our body), (8,4) T, (9,4) . but our body has (8,4) as second segment. Yes.\nRow 3: \"3 . A . . . . . . T T\" \u2192 (0,3) ., (1,3) A, (2,3) ., (3,3) ., (4,3) ., (5,3) ., (6,3) ., (7,3) ., (8,3) T, (9,3) T\nRow 2: \"2 . . . . . . . . . T\" \u2192 (0,2) ., (1,2) ., (2,2) ., (3,2) ., (4,2) ., (5,2) ., (6,2) ., (7,2) ., (8,2) ., (9,2) T\nRow 1: \"1 A A . A . . . . . T\" \u2192 (0,1) A, (1,1) A, (2,1) ., (3,1) A, (4,1) ., (5,1) ., (6,1) ., (7,1) ., (8,1) ., (9,1) T\nRow 0: \"0 A A A . . . . T T T\" \u2192 (0,0) A, (1,0) A, (2,0) A, (3,0) ., (4,0) ., (5,0) ., (6,0) ., (7,0) T, (8,0) T, (9,0) T\n\nSo (6,5) is row 5, column 6? From row 5 string: \". T T T T T . A A .\" At index 6 (0-based), that's '.' after index 5? Let's index: index 0: ., 1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: T, 5: T, 6: ., 7: A, 8: A, 9: . So (6,5) is '.' \u2013 empty. But is it occupied by my own body? My body: (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0). (6,5) is not in that list. Enemy body: from head (6,7) down: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (6,5) is not in enemy body. So UP to (6,5) is safe from body collisions. Also not off board. Good.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,3):** Row 3, column 6. Row 3: \". A . . . . . . T T\" \u2192 index 6 is '.'? Let's see: index 0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: ., 8: T, 9: T. So (6,3) is '.' empty. My body doesn't include (6,3). Enemy body doesn't include (6,3). Safe.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,4):** Row 4, column 5. Row 4: \". . . . . . 0 T T .\" \u2192 index 5 is '.'? Index 0: .,1: .,2: .,3: .,4: .,5: .,6: 0,7: T,8: T,9: . So (5,4) is '.' empty. My body: no (5,4). Enemy body: no (5,4). Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,4):** Row 4, column 7. Row 4: index 7 is T (my body segment). So moving into my own body \u2013 instant death. Not safe. So RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nAll directions except RIGHT are safe. Good.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for aggression and future options.**\n\nGoal: Pressure enemy, force head-on if beneficial, avoid traps.\n\n- **UP to (6,5):** \n  - Board position: Moves us north, closer to enemy at (6,7). Distance to enemy head: 2 cells vertically (from (6,4) to (6,7)). After move, distance becomes 1 cell (from (6,5) to (6,7) or (6,6)? Actually enemy head at (6,7), so from (6,5) to (6,7) is two steps? No, from (6,5) to (6,7) is two cells up, but we can only move one per turn. So still not adjacent yet. But we're getting closer.\n  - Apple: (7,5) is an apple (from row 5, index 7 is A). (6,5) is not an apple, but (7,5) is adjacent. If we go UP to (6,5), next turn we could go RIGHT to (7,5) for apple. But we're focusing on enemy, not apples.\n  - Future moves from (6,5): Check safety. From (6,5), possible moves: \n    - UP to (6,6): That's occupied by enemy body? Enemy body has (6,6) as first body segment after head? Actually enemy body list: head (6,7), then (6,6), (5,6)... So (6,6) is enemy body. Moving into enemy body = death. So UP from (6,5) would be unsafe if enemy remains there. But enemy moves simultaneously. So we need to predict.\n    - DOWN to (6,4): That's our previous head position. After we move, our tail will move? Wait, we grow only if we eat apple. Currently no apple at (6,5), so we don't grow. Our tail (7,0) will move forward? Actually, when we don't eat, the tail moves forward to the next segment. So after moving from (6,4) to (6,5), our body will become: new head (6,5), then old head (6,4), then (7,4), etc. So (6,4) becomes part of our body. So moving DOWN from (6,5) to (6,4) would be moving into our own body (since (6,4) will be our neck). That's backwards into our own body \u2013 death. So DOWN from (6,5) is unsafe in the next turn unless we eat an apple and grow, but we're not eating now. So after moving to (6,5), DOWN is a bad option because it's our own body.\n    - LEFT to (5,5): (5,5) is enemy body? Enemy body has (5,5) as part of the list. Yes, from enemy body: ... (5,5), (4,5)... So (5,5) is enemy body. Moving into enemy body = death. Unsafe.\n    - RIGHT to (7,5): (7,5) is an apple. Also, (7,5) is empty? From row 5, index 7 is A (apple). No snake body there. So RIGHT to (7,5) is safe and would eat an apple, growing us. But we need to consider if enemy could be there simultaneously? Enemy is at (6,7), far. So likely safe. But after eating, we grow, so tail doesn't move, which might affect future moves but generally good.\n\n  So from (6,5), the only immediately safe move for next turn might be RIGHT to (7,5) (if apple) or possibly UP if enemy moves away. But UP into (6,6) is enemy body, so if enemy stays, it's death. If enemy moves away, it could be safe. But we don't know. So (6,5) might limit future moves.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,3):** \n  - Moves us south, away from enemy. Enemy is at (6,7), so distance increases.\n  - Apple: (6,3) is empty, no apple. Adjacent apples? (7,3) is empty? Row 3, index 7 is '.'? Yes, empty. (5,3) empty. Not great for apples.\n  - Future moves from (6,3): Check safety.\n    - UP to (6,4): That's our old head, will be our body after moving. So moving UP from (6,3) to (6,4) would be into our own body (neck). Death. So UP is unsafe after this move.\n    - DOWN to (6,2): Row 2, column 6. Row 2: all '.' except (9,2) is T. So (6,2) is '.' empty. Safe from bodies. But is it close to enemy? No, far.\n    - LEFT to (5,3): Row 3, column 5. Row 3 index 5 is '.' (from earlier). Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (7,3): Row 3, column 7. Row 3 index 7 is '.' empty. Safe.\n  So from (6,3), we have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe for next turn. UP is death. So three options. That's decent for keeping options open.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,4):** \n  - Moves us west, directly toward the left side where enemy body is. Aggressive.\n  - Distance to enemy head: from (5,4) to (6,7) is diagonal. Not directly approaching, but cutting off escape.\n  - Apple: (5,4) is empty, no apple. Adjacent apples? (4,4) empty, (6,4) empty but will be body. (5,5) is enemy body, (5,3) empty. So no immediate apple.\n  - Future moves from (5,4): Check safety.\n    - UP to (5,5): That's enemy body (as above). Moving into enemy body = death. Unsafe.\n    - DOWN to (5,3): Row 3, column 5. Empty ('.' from row 3). Safe.\n    - LEFT to (4,4): Row 4, column 4. Row 4 index 4 is '.' (row 4: \"... . . . 0 T T .\" so index 4 is '.'). Empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (6,4): That's our old head, will be our body after moving. So moving into our own body = death. Unsafe.\n  So from (5,4), only DOWN and LEFT are safe for next turn. Two options. Still decent.\n\n**Comparison of safe moves:**\n\n- UP to (6,5): Provides closeness to enemy but limits future moves (only RIGHT likely safe if we want to eat apple, and even that depends). Also, from (6,5), if we don't eat apple, we might be trapped because UP and LEFT are enemy body, DOWN is our own body. Only RIGHT is safe. That's a bottleneck. Could be risky if enemy blocks RIGHT later.\n- DOWN to (6,3): Moves us away from enemy, but gives us three future safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). We keep options open and can navigate to apples or back to center. However, it's not aggressive; enemy might not feel pressured.\n- LEFT to (5,4): Moves toward enemy's body area, aggressive. Gives two future safe moves (DOWN and LEFT). Could set up to corner enemy against left wall. But from (5,4), we're closer to enemy body (5,5) above, which is dangerous.\n\n**Aggression vs Safety:** We're behind by 1 apple. We need to be aggressive but not reckless. Force head-on collision only if we have advantage, but we're tied? Actually score: us 9, enemy 10. So enemy has higher score. If we force head-on, we both die, and enemy wins because they have more apples (10 vs 9). So we should avoid head-on until we equal or surpass. But we can pressure to force them into mistakes.\n\nFrom our last move rationale, we chose LEFT to be aggressive. Continuing that theme: LEFT to (5,4) keeps us on the offensive.\n\nBut let's consider enemy's likely move. Enemy head at (6,7). Possible moves for enemy:\n- UP to (6,8): Row 8, column 6. Row 8: \". T . . A . . . . .\" \u2192 index 6 is '.'? Index 0: .,1: T,2: .,3: .,4: A,5: .,6: .,7: .,8: .,9: . So (6,8) is '.' empty. Safe for enemy? But enemy body has (1,8) as tail? Actually enemy body list: (1,8) is last. So (6,8) is not in their body. But check if (6,8) is off board? No. So UP is possible.\n- RIGHT to (7,7): Row 7, column 7. Row 7: \"7 . T . A . . 1 A . .\" \u2192 index 7 is A (apple). But (7,7) is occupied by apple, not snake. So empty. Safe for enemy.\n- DOWN to (6,6): Row 6, column 6. Row 6: \"6 . T . . . T T . . A\" \u2192 index 6 is T? Wait, row 6: index 0: .,1: T,2: .,3: .,4: .,5: T,6: T,7: .,8: .,9: A. So (6,6) is T (enemy body). So DOWN to (6,6) is moving into their own body \u2013 death for enemy. So enemy cannot go DOWN.\n- LEFT to (5,7): Row 7, column 5. Row 7: index 5 is '.' (from \" . . 1 A . .\" actually: characters: after (4,7) is ., (5,7) is ., (6,7) is 1). So (5,7) is '.' empty. But is it occupied by enemy body? Enemy body has (5,6), (5,5), etc., but not (5,7). So LEFT is safe for enemy.\n\nSo enemy likely moves UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. DOWN is suicide. So enemy might go UP to (6,8) or RIGHT to (7,7) or LEFT to (5,7). If enemy goes RIGHT to (7,7), they might eat apple at (7,7) and grow. That would give them 11 apples, widening lead.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,4), and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,7), no collision. If enemy goes UP to (6,8), also no collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (5,7), also no collision. So no immediate head-on.\n\nBut we want to set up future collisions. From (5,4), if enemy goes UP to (6,8), we could chase. But we're far.\n\nFrom (6,5), if we go UP, and enemy goes RIGHT to (7,7), no collision. If enemy goes UP to (6,8), we're at (6,5), still safe.\n\nFrom (6,3), we're far, enemy might ignore.\n\n**Decision:** I think LEFT to (5,4) is best for aggression. It positions us to the left side, where enemy's body is. We can try to trap them against the left wall. Also, from (5,4), we can go DOWN to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,4) next turn, both safe. That gives us room to maneuver toward apples (e.g., (4,4) is empty, (5,3) is empty). We might find apples in that region. The apple list includes (4,8), (3,1), etc., but not immediate. However, we can work our way.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,5), we're very constrained. Only RIGHT is safe next turn (to eat apple at (7,5)), which gives us growth but also puts us at (7,5) with body following. From (7,5), future moves: check? But after eating, we grow, so tail doesn't move. That might be okay, but we need to see if we get trapped.\n\nBut the key is: we need to be aggressive and force enemy into bad positions. Going LEFT aligns with last move and continues pressure.\n\nAlso, note: enemy's body is on the left side (x=1 to 5). By going to (5,4), we're getting closer to that area. We could potentially cut off their escape or force them into their own body.\n\n**Long-term plan:** From (5,4), next turn go LEFT to (4,4) to further approach left side, or DOWN to (5,3) to avoid being blocked. Then snake through left area, eating apples if available, and position to force enemy into corner. Monitor enemy score; if they grow, we need to eat apples soon to catch up. But focus on controlling space.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT.\n\nNow, I need to output the rationale and then the move.\n\nRationale should include: decision process, safety check, strategic planning.\n\nLet's craft the response.Yo chat! We're at turn 24, score 9-10\u2014enemy's ahead by one apple, but we're closing in! Let's break this down like a pro.\n\n**Step 1: Safety Check from (6,4).**  \n- **UP to (6,5):** Empty, no body collisions. Safe. \u2705  \n- **DOWN to (6,3):** Empty, no body collisions. Safe. \u2705  \n- **LEFT to (5,4):** Empty, no body collisions. Safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT to (7,4):** That's my own body segment (my neck). Death move. \u274c Eliminated.  \n\nAll three options keep us alive\u2014now let's pick the most aggressive.\n\n**Step 2: Strategic Warfare.**  \n- **UP to (6,5):** Gets us closer to enemy at (6,7), but limits future moves\u2014only RIGHT is safe next turn (into apple at (7,5)). If we don't eat, UP is blocked by enemy body (6,6), DOWN is our own body, LEFT is enemy body (5,5). Bottle city. Not ideal for dominance.  \n- **DOWN to (6,3):** Moves us away from the fight. Safe with three future options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), but we're playing defensive while enemy might grow. We need pressure, not retreat!  \n- **LEFT to (5,4):** Aggressive as hell! We're now in the left zone where enemy's body snakes (1,5) to (5,5). This cuts off their escape routes and sets up a corner trap. From here, next turn we can go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3)\u2014both safe and keep us in the hunt. Plus, we're forcing enemy to react.  \n\n**Enemy Prediction:**  \nSnake #1 at (6,7) can go UP (6,8), RIGHT (7,7) for an apple, or LEFT (5,7). DOWN is suicide. No head-on collision this turn if we move left\u2014they're not moving into our path. But by advancing left, we're boxing them in against their own body or the wall. If they panic and move into a tight spot, they might crash later!  \n\n**Why Not Head-On?**  \nWe're behind in apples (9 vs 10). A mutual crash means we lose since they have more. So we avoid collisions until we equal or lead. Instead, we dominate space and force errors.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan (For Future Us):**  \nFrom (5,4), next move likely LEFT to (4,4) to keep pressuring the left side, or DOWN to (5,3) to flank. Watch for apples (4,8), (3,1), etc., as we slide. Goal: Trap enemy between their body and the wall, then steal their apples or force a suicide crash.  \n\nLet's move! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

I'll check each move for safety and strategic value.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My head: (6,4)\n- Enemy head: (7,7)\n- My body: (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0), (8,0), (7,0)\n- Enemy body: (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n- Apples: (7,5), (3,7), (1,1), (0,1), (3,1), (9,6), (2,0), (8,5), (4,8), (1,0), (7,9), (0,0), (0,9), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1. **UP to (6,5):**\n   - Check safety: (6,5) is empty according to the board (row 5, col 6 is '.').\n   - Not my body (my body is at (7,4), (8,4), etc.)\n   - Not enemy body (enemy body is at (5,5), (4,5), etc.)\n   - Safe from immediate death.\n   - Future options: From (6,5), possible moves next turn:\n     - UP to (6,6): enemy body (occupied), so dangerous if enemy doesn't move\n     - DOWN to (6,4): will be my own body after moving (since I'm moving from (6,4)), so deadly\n     - LEFT to (5,5): enemy body, deadly\n     - RIGHT to (7,5): empty and has an apple! Safe and could get apple.\n   - So only RIGHT is safe from (6,5) if we want to avoid risk. That's a risky spot \u2013 too limited.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,3):**\n   - Check safety: (6,3) is empty (row 3, col 6 is '.')\n   - Not my body\n   - Not enemy body\n   - Safe.\n   - Future options from (6,3):\n     - UP to (6,4): will be my own body after moving (since I'm moving from (6,4)), so deadly\n     - DOWN to (6,2): empty (row 2, col 6 is '.')\n     - LEFT to (5,3): empty (row 3, col 5 is '.')\n     - RIGHT to (7,3): empty (row 3, col 7 is '.')\n   - So we have 3 safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n   - But this moves us away from the enemy and apples.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,4):**\n   - Check safety: (5,4) is empty (row 4, col 5 is '.')\n   - Not my body\n   - Not enemy body (enemy body at (5,5), (5,6) but not (5,4))\n   - Safe.\n   - Future options from (5,4):\n     - UP to (5,5): enemy body (occupied), deadly if enemy stays\n     - DOWN to (5,3): empty (row 3, col 5 is '.')\n     - LEFT to (4,4): empty (row 4, col 4 is '.')\n     - RIGHT to (6,4): will be my own body after moving, so deadly\n   - So we have 2 safe options (DOWN and LEFT). Still reasonable.\n   - This moves us toward the left side where there are apples (like (4,8), (3,1), (2,4), etc.) and cuts off enemy's potential escape routes.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7,4):**\n   - Check safety: (7,4) is my own body segment (from my body list: (7,4))\n   - This is moving into my own body \u2013 immediate death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- My score: 9 apples, Enemy: 11 apples. I'm behind. I need to grow and close the gap.\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is near the apple at (7,5) and (7,9). They might go for (7,5) or (7,9).\n- If I go UP to (6,5), I'm getting closer to the enemy, but it's risky because my next move options are limited. However, RIGHT to (7,5) would give me an apple (grows me to 10 apples) and puts me closer to the enemy's position (7,7) \u2013 potentially setting up a head-on collision if I want to challenge them. But with my score lower, I don't want a direct collision yet unless I can win.\n- If I go LEFT to (5,4), I'm moving toward the left side where there are apples like (4,8), (3,1), (2,4), (1,3), etc. Also, I'm moving away from the enemy, giving me space to grow. From (5,4), I could then go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), both leading to areas with apples or open space.\n- If I go DOWN to (6,3), I'm moving away from everything, which might be too passive. I need to be aggressive to catch up.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe enemy has 11 apples, I have 9. I need to eat apples to catch up. The apple at (7,5) is very close if I go UP to (6,5) then RIGHT to (7,5). But going UP to (6,5) puts me in a spot where if I don't get that apple next turn, I might be in trouble because my other moves from (6,5) are into dangerous areas (enemy body or my own body). However, if I go LEFT to (5,4), I can then go LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3), both of which have apples nearby? Let's check:\n- (4,4): empty, but (4,8) is an apple up north. (4,4) to (4,5) is enemy body though, so need to be careful.\n- (5,3): empty, and (3,1) is an apple down-left. (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,1) \u2013 but (3,1) is an apple! So there's a path.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (2,4) which is somewhat near (5,4) if I go LEFT twice: (5,4) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4). But (3,4) is empty? Row 4, col 3 is '.'? Yes, empty. (2,4) has an apple. So that's a potential apple route.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nAt (7,7), the enemy can go:\n- UP to (7,8): empty? Row 8, col 7 is '.'? Yes.\n- DOWN to (7,6): empty? Row 6, col 7 is '.'? Yes.\n- LEFT to (6,7): that's their own body? Actually (6,7) is their own body? Their body list includes (6,7) as the first segment after head? Wait, their body is: head (7,7), then (6,7), (6,6), ... So (6,7) is their own body. Moving LEFT to (6,7) would be moving into their own body \u2013 death for them! So they won't do that unless they want to die.\n- RIGHT to (8,7): empty? Row 7, col 8 is '.'? Yes.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves from (7,7) are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. They can't go LEFT because it's their own body. This means they're somewhat constrained to the right side of the board. This is good for me because it limits their movement and they might get trapped in the corner.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4), I'm moving away from them, and they're likely to move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, which doesn't bring them toward me directly. This gives me time to eat apples and grow.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,5), I'm moving toward them, and if they move DOWN to (7,6), then next turn I could be at (6,5) and they at (7,6) \u2013 not directly colliding but close. If I then go RIGHT to (7,5) to eat the apple, and they go DOWN to (7,6) or something, no collision. But if I go UP to (6,5) and they go DOWN to (7,6), then my next move RIGHT to (7,5) is safe, and then from there I could go UP to (7,6) if they move away? But (7,6) might be empty then. However, it's getting complicated.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nI need to eat apples to catch up (currently 9 vs 11). The board has many apples, but I should avoid risky collisions until I have more apples than the enemy. Since I'm behind, I should focus on safe apple collection. The enemy is somewhat trapped on the right side (they can't go LEFT into their own body). By moving LEFT, I can control the left side of the board and eat apples there (like (4,8), (3,1), (2,4), (1,3), etc.) without immediately confronting the enemy. This also gives me room to maneuver and grow.\n\nIf I go UP to (6,5), I'm taking a risk: if the enemy doesn't move away from (6,6), I might be forced into a dangerous position next turn. Also, I'm not eating an apple immediately.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3), I'm too passive and might not catch up.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll go LEFT to (5,4). This moves me toward the left side where there are apples, gives me two safe follow-up moves (LEFT or DOWN), and keeps me away from immediate confrontation. From there, I can plan to eat (2,4) or (3,1) or (4,8) while the enemy is stuck on the right. Once I have more apples than the enemy, I can consider aggressive moves to force a head-on collision.\n\n**Final Move:** LEFT",

Let's break this down FAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (4,4) \u2190 Wait! Hold up! The board shows my head at (4,4) but the description says (4,4)? Actually looking at the board state: row 4 has \". . A . 0 T T T T .\" so my head is at (4,4) and my body stretches right to (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (9,0).\n- Enemy head: (7,8) with body stretching down-left: (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n- Apples: TONS on board!\n\n**ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP to (4,5):** Enemy body at (4,5)! That's their 7th segment. Immediate death! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (4,3):** Board shows (4,3) is empty ('.' in row 3, col 4). Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE!\n3. **LEFT to (3,4):** Board shows (3,4) is empty ('.' in row 4, col 3). Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE!\n4. **RIGHT to (5,4):** That's MY OWN BODY! First segment after head. Immediate death! \u274c\n\nSo we have 2 safe moves: DOWN and LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\n**DOWN to (4,3):**\n- Gets us toward the bottom-left apples: (3,1), (1,1), (0,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0)\n- From (4,3), future options:\n  - UP back to (4,4) - will be empty after we leave\n  - LEFT to (3,3) - empty\n  - RIGHT to (5,3) - empty\n  - DOWN to (4,2) - empty (row 2, col 4 is '.')\n- **4 SAFE FOLLOW-UPS!** Excellent flexibility!\n- Moves us AWAY from enemy who's at (7,8) - they're going UP/DOWN/RIGHT probably.\n\n**LEFT to (3,4):**\n- Moves us toward the left side apples: (3,7) is an apple but that's UP, (2,4) is an apple! (1,3) is an apple! (0,9) is an apple way up!\n- From (3,4), future options:\n  - UP to (3,5): Enemy body at (3,5)! Deadly!\n  - DOWN to (3,3): Empty - SAFE\n  - LEFT to (2,4): Apple! SAFE!\n  - RIGHT to (4,4): Will be empty after we leave - SAFE\n- **3 SAFE FOLLOW-UPS** (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) - but UP is deadly!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (7,8) can move:\n- UP to (7,9): Apple there! (7,9) is an apple!\n- DOWN to (7,7): Their own body! Deadly!\n- LEFT to (6,8): Empty? Row 8, col 6 is '.'? Actually row 8 shows: \". . . . A . . 1 . .\" so col 6 is '.' - SAFE\n- RIGHT to (8,8): Empty? Row 8, col 8 is '.' - SAFE\n\nSo enemy will likely go UP to eat (7,9) or LEFT/RIGHT to explore. They're NOT coming toward us!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to CATCH UP! I have 9 apples, they have 11. Every apple counts!\n\n**DOWN to (4,3)** gives me 4 SAFE follow-up moves AND gets me closer to the apple cluster at bottom-left: (3,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1), (0,1). From there I can circle and eat multiple apples while the enemy is stuck on the right!\n\n**LEFT to (3,4)** gives me access to (2,4) apple but limits me slightly and gets me closer to the center where enemy body is.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nGo DOWN, eat bottom-left apples, grow to 12+ apples, then trap the enemy in the corner. Once I have more apples, force head-on collision. CHAT, THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN",

Segment right after head. Immediate death! \u274c\n2. **LEFT to (3,3):** Empty! Safe! Gives access to (2,4) apple later!\n3. **RIGHT to (5,3):** Empty! Safe!

Bottom-left apples calling!\n\n**STRATEGIC BRAINSTORM:**\n\n- **LEFT (3,3):** Moves toward center-left, avoids enemy, opens path to (2,4), (1,3), (0,1) apples. From (3,3): can go UP (3,4) which is empty, DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3). **4 SAFE OPTIONS!**\n- **RIGHT (5,3):** Moves toward enemy territory (dangerous!). From (5,3): UP (5,4) is MY BODY!

RIGHT (7,8) is enemy body. DOWN (7,7) is enemy body. So enemy likely goes LEFT to (5,8) to eat apple or UP to (6,9).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to catch up on apples! I'm at 9, they're at 11. The bottom-left apple cluster (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (1,1), (0,1), (3,1), (1,3) is ours to claim!\n\n**DOWN to (4,2)** is the move! It:\n- Gets us closer to the apple feast\n- Maintains 4 safe follow-up moves\n- Avoids immediate enemy confrontation\n- Sets up a LONG-TERM PLAN: Claim bottom-left apples, grow to 12+, then circle and trap the enemy in the top-right corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (4,2), we'll go LEFT to (3,2), then DOWN to (3,1) for the apple, then continue sweeping the bottom row. Once we hit 12+ apples, we'll force a head-on collision when we have the score advantage!\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN",

There's an apple directly at (5,8) on the board! Row 8 shows: \". . . . A . 1 T . .\" so column 5 (0-indexed) is 'A' - apple! Enemy will likely grab that apple by moving... wait, they're already at (5,8)? Let me check... Actually enemy head is at (5,8) already! The apple is AT their head! So they might eat it and grow, or move to another apple.\n\nLooking at board: Row 8 col 5 is 'A' - enemy is ON the apple! So they'll definitely eat it this turn, growing to 12 apples. They might then move UP to (5,9) which is empty, or LEFT to (4,8) which is empty, or RIGHT to (6,8) but that's their own body. DOWN to (5,7) is empty. So they have options.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nWe need apples! There are apples at: (3,1), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (4,8), (0,9), (1,3), (2,4)\n\n**DOWN to (4,1)** is the move! It:\n- Gets us DIRECTLY adjacent to apple at (3,1) and (2,0) and (1,0)\n- From (4,1): we can go LEFT to (3,1) for apple next turn\n- Maintains 4 safe follow-up options\n- Bottom-left apples are OURS to feast on!\n- Avoids enemy who's up top eating apples\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 29: From (4,1) \u2192 LEFT to (3,1) to eat apple (grow to 10)\nTurn 30: From (3,1) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) or LEFT to (2,1) \u2192 grab more bottom apples\nGoal: Hit 12+ apples and then start boxing in the enemy in top-right!\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN",

Let's check the new board state after my DOWN move!\n\n**Board State Analysis:**\n- My head: (4, 1) - just moved DOWN from (4,2)\n- My body: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (9, 3)]\n- Enemy head: (4, 8) - they moved LEFT from (5,8)! \n- Enemy body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]\n\n**ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **UP to (4, 2):** That's MY OWN BODY! The segment right behind me! Immediate death! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (4, 0):** Empty! Safe! But it's on the edge - from there only UP (4,1) is safe, LEFT (3,0) empty, RIGHT (5,0) empty. That's 3 options, but getting close to corner trap. Not ideal.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 1):** Apple there! Safe! From (3,1): UP (3,2) empty, DOWN (3,0) empty, LEFT (2,1) empty, RIGHT back to (4,1). **4 SAFE OPTIONS!** Plus we get the apple!\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 1):** Empty! Safe! From (5,1): UP (5,2) empty, DOWN (5,0) empty, LEFT back to (4,1), RIGHT (6,1) empty. **4 SAFE OPTIONS!**\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nEnemy at (4, 8) just ate the apple and is now looking at the board. They're at the top-left of their body maze. From (4,8), they can go: UP (4,9) empty, LEFT (3,8) empty, RIGHT (5,8) which is now their body (tail segment), DOWN (4,7) empty. They likely go UP toward apples at (0,9) or (1,9) or go LEFT toward (3,8). They're building their wall.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\nI have an apple at (3,1) RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! This is a no-brainer! I need to close the apple gap (9 vs 12). \n\n**LEFT to (3, 1)** is the move! It:\n- Gets me the apple! That's +1 apple, growing to 10 apples!\n- Opens up 4 safe follow-up moves from (3,1)\n- Gets me closer to the cluster of bottom-left apples: (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1), (0,1)\n- Maintains my position away from the enemy who's building in the top-right\n- Sets up a chain of apple grabs for the next few turns!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 29: From (4,1) \u2192 LEFT to (3,1) EAT APPLE (grow to 10)\nTurn 30: From (3,1) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) or LEFT to (2,1) \u2192 grab more bottom-left apples\nGoal: Chain-eat the bottom-left cluster to hit 12+ apples and close the gap! Then we'll think about boxing in the enemy!\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The tail segment is right there!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nI'm at 11 apples vs their 12 - STILL CLOSE! The bottom-left is ABSOLUTELY LOADED with apples: (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1), (0,1). This is my gold mine! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**UP to (3, 2)** is the play! Why?\n- It's SAFE (empty)\n- It maintains maximum future options\n- From (3,2), I can go RIGHT to (4,2) which is MY BODY (no), UP to (3,3) empty, LEFT to (2,2) empty, or DOWN back to (3,1)\n- But more importantly, it keeps me positioned to SWING DOWN on the next turn to grab (3,0) OR swing LEFT to grab (2,1) \u2192 (2,0)\n- It keeps me AWAY from the enemy who's in the top-left corner\n- It avoids the corner trap at (3,0) where I'd be more limited\n\n**CRITICAL REALIZATION:** The enemy at (4,7) is moving AWAY from me toward the top! They're building in the opposite direction. I have the entire bottom-left quadrant to myself! This is HUGE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 30: From (3,1) \u2192 UP to (3,2) - Positioning\nTurn 31: From (3,2) \u2192 DOWN to (3,0) EAT APPLE \u2192 grow to 12 apples! TIE!\nTurn 32: From (3,0) \u2192 LEFT to (2,0) EAT APPLE \u2192 lead with 13 apples!\nGoal: Clean sweep of bottom-left apples (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1) to hit 15+ and DOMINATE!\n\n**DECISION:** UP\nLet's GOOOO CHAT! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nUP",

Their possible moves this turn are (3,0), (3,2), (2,1) or the illegal (4,1). None of those reach (3,7). So a head\u2011on collision this turn is impossible.\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long\u2011term vibe:**  \nSnagging the apple gives us +1 score (13\u202fvs\u202f10) and a new segment, which widens our \u201cwall\u201d and makes it harder for #0 to slip past us later. Heading left also opens up a whole corridor of free cells (2,7), (3,8), (3\u202f6) for the next few turns, keeping our options open and avoiding a tight box near our own tail.\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 Safety check:**  \nLEFT doesn\u2019t put us into any snake body, our own or theirs, and it stays comfortably away from the opponent\u2019s vertical column of bodies at x=4.\n\n**Game plan for the next couple of moves:**  \n- **Turn\u202f31:** Go LEFT onto the apple.  \n- **Turn\u202f32\u201133:** Assess whether we can swing up or down to start hemming #0 in his own hallway (the column\u20114 corridor).  \n- Keep the pressure, grow when we can, and look for a head\u2011on showdown when our apple lead is solid.\n\nLet\u2019s crush this! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

That's the plan!\n\n**CRITICAL DECISION POINT:**\n\nWAIT! The enemy is at (0, 6) - they're directly ABOVE me on the same column! If they move DOWN to (0, 5) and I stay at (0, 1), we're far apart. BUT if I go DOWN to (0, 0), I'm claiming that apple and putting myself in a corner.\n\n**THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nFrom (0, 0), I'll have ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: UP back to (0, 1). That's fine - I can dance in this left corridor! The enemy has a long body ahead of them, and I'm scoring points.\n\n**BUT WAIT! ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere will they go?

No collisions!\n- From (0, 0), I can only go UP, but that's fine - I control the left corridor\n- Enemy is still 5 tiles above me - plenty of space\n- I get to keep eating while enemy is stuck navigating their own tail!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 35: From (0, 1) \u2192 DOWN to (0, 0) EAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (Score: 13 vs 14)\nTurn 36: From (0, 0) \u2192 UP to (0, 1) (retreat)\nTurn 37: From (0, 1) \u2192 RIGHT to (1, 1) (my tail will have moved!)\nGoal: Chase that apple cluster on the left while maintaining flexibility!

(Enemy still at 14)\n- My body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n- Enemy head: (0, 5) - They just moved DOWN from (0, 6)! They're getting CLOSER to me on the left edge!\n- Enemy body: [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n\n**ELIMINATING DEAD MOVES:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (-1, 0):** OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! NO GO!\n2. **DOWN to (0, -1):** OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEAD! NO GO!\n3. **RIGHT to (1, 0):** EMPTY! Safe! No apple here.\n4. **UP to (0, 1):** MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD! That's my tail!\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nWAIT! The enemy is at (0, 5) - they're literally DIRECTLY ABOVE ME! Two tiles away on the same column! \n\nFrom (0, 0), my ONLY SAFE MOVE is RIGHT to (1, 0). UP is suicide (into my own tail). If I don't move RIGHT, I'm dead!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nWhere will they go from (0, 5)?\n- LEFT: OFF BOARD! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1, 5): EMPTY! (There's no snake body there)\n- UP to (0, 6): THEIR OWN BODY! \u274c (that's their tail!)\n- DOWN to (0, 4): EMPTY! (No apple there, but safe)\n\nThey can't go UP into their own tail. They can't go LEFT. So they MUST go either RIGHT or DOWN!\n\n**THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nI'm moving RIGHT to (1, 0). This does two things:\n1. **AVOIDS HEAD-ON COLLISION:** If I stayed at (0, 0) and they moved DOWN to (0, 4) or RIGHT to (1, 5), no collision. But I'm forced to move anyway!\n2. **POSITIONING FOR OPPORTUNITY:** From (1, 0), I can go UP to (1, 1) (my tail will have moved!) or RIGHT to (2, 0) or LEFT back to (0, 0) (but that might be dangerous next turn).\n\n**THE MOVE: RIGHT to (1, 0)!**\nWhy?\n- \u2705 **ONLY SAFE MOVE!** LEFT and UP are death. DOWN is off board. RIGHT is my salvation!\n- From (1, 0), I'll have multiple options next turn: UP to (1, 1), RIGHT to (2, 0), or DOWN back to (1, -1) which would be off board so NOT that one.\n- The enemy is forced to move RIGHT or DOWN from (0, 5), putting them further from me on the left edge. This gives me space to maneuver!\n- I stay alive to fight another turn and close the 1-point gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 36: From (0, 0) \u2192 RIGHT to (1, 0) (CRITICAL SURVIVAL!)\nTurn 37: From (1, 0) \u2192 UP to (1, 1) (my tail will have vacated!)\nTurn 38: From (1, 1) \u2192 UP to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 1) - chase those apples near the bottom-right!\nGoal: Get out of the left corner, navigate toward the apple cluster at (2, 0), (8, 2), or (5, 1) while keeping enemy away from my tail!\n\n**DECISION:** RIGHT\nSURVIVAL FIRST! LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",
