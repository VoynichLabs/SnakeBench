Both have no body segments yet.\n- There's an apple RIGHT ABOVE us at (7,6). No immediate threats around our 4 adjacent squares.\n\nDecision checklist (thinking out loud for the stream, cuz y\u2019all love this):\n1) All four candidate moves:\n   - UP -> (7,6): contains an apple. Safe. Gives us +1 apple and a length increase. Plenty of escape options afterwards.\n   - DOWN -> (7,4): empty. Safe. Moves away from the apple and keeps space.\n   - LEFT -> (6,5): empty. Safe. Moves toward the center/away from the left-side enemy, slightly more aggressive.\n   - RIGHT -> (8,5): empty. Safe. Moves toward the right side edge later, but still fine.\n\n2) Eliminate immediate death moves:\n   - None. All four are legal and won't cause an instant crash.\n\n3) Strategic pick among safe moves:\n   - Eat the apple at (7,6) \u2014 why? It gives us the first apple (lead = leverage), grows our body (useful for boxing later), and doesn't box us in immediately. After grabbing this, we can shift to a more aggressive posture. If we get ahead on score, we can safely risk forcing head-ons later to pressure the rival.\n   - Moving LEFT aggressively toward the opponent now would be tempting, but both snakes are tied (0-0) \u2014 we should avoid risky head-on trades until we have a scoring edge.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will show up as our last rationale next turn):\n- Grab the apple at (7,6) now to take first blood. After that, pivot leftwards and compress the middle column(s) to corral the enemy toward the left wall. If we maintain a scoring lead, start forcing head-to-head confrontations to end them. Always keep >1 escape option when we close in.\n\nAlright chat, time to eat and set the trap \u2014 let's snag that apple and get momentum! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

We WANT to be the pressure \u2014 not the runner.\n\nWhy LEFT:\n- Continues our aggression from last move (keeps compressing their area).\n- Reduces their lateral escape options and positions us to pivot up/down to cut them off.\n- Keeps multiple follow-up moves open (we\u2019ll still have UP/DOWN/LEFT available next turn), which avoids self-boxing.\n- If they get greedy for (5,5), we can contest or force a risky head conflict \u2014 and we\u2019re ahead on apples, so a head-on trade could be to our advantage if it comes to that.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns \u2014 this will be our last rationale next turn):\n- Move LEFT to (5,6) now to close horizontal distance.\n- On the next turn, pivot UP or DOWN depending on the opponent\u2019s move to shrink his escape corridor. If he drifts toward the left wall, cut him off and threaten a head-on if he tries to bull past us \u2014 we win ties in double-KO (we\u2019re +1).\n- Maintain at least one clear escape route at all times; don\u2019t chase into a single-file tunnel.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX HIM IN \u2014 time to pressure.

That leaves only UP -> (4,6) or LEFT -> (3,5).\n\nEvaluate the two safe moves:\n- UP to (4,6): safe and conservative. Keeps options but drifts away from the enemy, cedes initiative.\n- LEFT to (3,5): safe and aggressive. Keeps me adjacent/overhead pressure relative to the enemy (they\u2019re at (4,3)), helps start hemming them in on the x-axis. From (3,5) I still have escape routes (UP to 3,6, DOWN to 3,4, LEFT to 2,5). Also preserves opportunity to pivot quickly to cut them off next turns.\n\nOpponent constraints: their neck is (4,4), so they CAN'T move UP (backwards). They\u2019ll likely try lateral or downward moves \u2014 staying close and aggressive gives us better chances to compress them toward bad spaces or force mistakes. We\u2019re up on apples (2 vs 1), so aggressive pressure and the threat of a head-on is favorable for us.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT now to maintain pressure and start boxing their horizontal escape.\n- On next turns, prioritize cutting their horizontal exits while keeping at least two escape options. Use apples only when it helps the trap.\n- If they overcommit toward us and a head-on becomes possible, that\u2019s fine \u2014 we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE HIM CRASH. LEFT",

Neck = (3,4) \u2014 so RIGHT is illegal (that\u2019s backwards). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) is occupied by their body (snake #1). Moving there = instant death per the rules.

Perfect bait.\n\nWhy LEFT is the play:\n- We\u2019re up 2\u21921 on apples. If they go UP into (1,4) at the same time we do, that\u2019s a head-on collision \u2014 double KO \u2014 and we WIN because of the apple lead. Do you smell that?

We stay close enough to box them toward the west edge while maintaining at least one escape route for ourselves.\n- UP is safer but gives them more options. We want to force a decisive outcome while we have the advantage.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 8: LEFT now to bait the head-on.\n- If they go UP and take the bait \u2192 we win immediately.\n- If they go LEFT toward (0,3) apple \u2192 follow pressure: move DOWN/LEFT as needed to cut off exits and force them into a corner or a forced head-on when advantageous.\n- If they try weird dodges \u2192 maintain proximity, avoid moving into their current body cells, and only commit to head-on when our apple lead secures the favorable tiebreak.\n\nLET\u2019S BAIT HIM \u2014 time to make him tilt on stream.

Box setup starts from above. \ud83e\udea4\n- Gives immediate access to the apple at (1,8) next turn if we want to grow and then confidently force head-on later (we\u2019re tied 2\u20132; an extra apple gives us leverage). \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT is okay but slightly less direct for pressuring this bottom-left rat. LEFT is too wall-huggy. We want options. Flexibility > reckless aggression. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- If they go RIGHT to (1,1), start descending column 1 to pin them between our body and the wall; force them into a 2-wide corridor and tighten. If they go DOWN to (0,0), approach and hem them in from the east while keeping an escape route.\n- If safe, take (1,8) next turn to gain an apple advantage, then use that score edge to risk a head-to-head if they try to run through us.\n- Avoid hugging the left wall until we\u2019ve got them squeezed \u2014 mobility wins fights.\n\nAlright \u2014 we bait, we trap, we wipe the floor.

Keep pressure, don\u2019t trap ourselves \u2014 prefer moving vertically along the wall to control space.\n- If they get cocky and try a risky head-on while we have the apple lead, we can contest.

They\u2019ll most likely chase (7,0) or step up to (5,1).

We\u2019re already long along column 0 \u2014 hugging it further makes trapping ourselves more likely.\n- Positions us to contest midboard apples and to start bending eastward to shrink the opponent\u2019s free space later.\n- We maintain the apple lead (5\u20134). With the lead, forcing eventual head-on collisions becomes an option \u2014 but only when advantageous. RIGHT keeps options open to force that later.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Turn now: RIGHT to (1,5) to grab central space.  \n- Next: push east along row 5 or cut up toward y=6 to pressure the center and target apples at (6,5)/(8,7)/(7,8) depending on opponent movement.  \n- If opponent commits to the bottom-right pocket, start hemming them in from the north/east; only force a head-on if we keep an apple advantage. Otherwise, continue to snake and pick safe apples while shrinking their escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

The opponent is stuck on the far left, so no head\u2011on collision risk this turn. Grabbing that apple also puts me in the sweet zone for the high\u2011value apples up top (like (7,8) and (9,5)).  \n\n**Plan:**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Move RIGHT now to eat the apple.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next turn aim UP or RIGHT toward the top\u2011right apples while keeping the left flank open.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Watch #0\u2019s vertical line; if they try to box me, bait a head\u2011on clash when I have the higher score.  \n\nRIGHT",

They want bottom/center apples.  \n- Scores are TIED 5\u20135, so we DO NOT want a risky head-on right now (tie means double KO would be bad). Play to preserve life and pressure instead of suicide-baiting.  \n- Moving RIGHT keeps the board open and directly contests the apple cluster around (6,5). It gives us multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) and maintains central control to later bend south and box the enemy in. UP would flirt with our own column-0 body less directly but doesn\u2019t contest the midboard \u2014 less aggressive. DOWN gives space but cedes center.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Push east along row 5 to contest (6,5). Maintain lateral mobility so we can pivot south toward x\u22484\u20136 to start hemming the opponent into the bottom-right pocket.  \n- Avoid any direct head-on while scores are tied. If we snag an extra apple and lead, then force the collision when they\u2019re cramped.  \n- Keep at least 2 safe escape options every turn \u2014 don\u2019t get trapped against our own tail column at x=0.\n\nFinal move \u2014 stay aggressive, take the center, and keep options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Their likely moves: UP (6,4), RIGHT (7,3), or LEFT (5,3). They can reach apple at (6,5) in two moves (UP,UP). We can also reach (6,5) in two moves (RIGHT,RIGHT). Important rule: if we both move into the same cell on the same turn, both die \u2014 and the opponent currently leads 7\u21925. We do NOT want to force a head-on while behind.\n\nDecision logic:\n- We should be aggressive and contest apples, but avoid suicidal head-on. Moving RIGHT to (5,5) keeps three follow-up options (RIGHT into the apple, UP, or DOWN) and keeps escape routes open. It puts pressure on the opponent and sets up contest for (6,5).\n- If the opponent commits toward (6,5) (we\u2019ll see them go UP\u2192UP or head-right then up), we will NOT blindly follow into a simultaneous collision \u2014 instead we\u2019ll pivot on turn 22 to (5,6) or (5,4) to avoid a double KO, then re-route to trap later when we can force a favorable head-on.\n- If they ignore the apple, we take (6,5) next turn and tie the score. Always maintain \u22652 escape options.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to pressure the apple at (6,5).\n- On turn 22, decide based on their move: if safe, push RIGHT again to eat (6,5). If they contest head-on, pivot to avoid double death and try to hem them into the bottom/right pocket later once we can force a favorable collision (i.e., once we\u2019re ahead).\n- Keep escape routes open and avoid getting funneled into the x=0 column.\n\nMake the play \u2014 stay aggressive, but don\u2019t throw the game for clout.

Important: we\u2019re behind on apples (7 vs 10) \u2014 we should prioritize growth while staying safe.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Immediate apple grab = quicker catch-up (we need length and points to box them later).  \n- Keeps multiple escape/options open after eating: can continue down or sweep left/right on row 8.  \n- Avoids risky head-on plays while we\u2019re still behind \u2014 we\u2019ll bait/confine after grabbing more apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (4,8) now, then evaluate chaining along row 8 (snipe nearby apples or pivot left to hem columns 2\u20135).  \n- Grow fast enough to threaten a head-on only when we\u2019ve tied or surpassed their apples.  \n- Watch for them moving up to (7,9) \u2014 if they commit top-right, we can collapse the left/top corridor.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT \u2014 DOWN",

NOPE. \ud83d\udc80  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) = empty. Keeps lots of exits (1,8 / 1,6 / 0,7). Good control and gets us closer to the apple at (1,6). \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) = empty, OK but slightly more constrained next-step (3,8 is our body). Neutral.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) = empty, also fine; moves into center. \u2705\n\nOpponent read: snake #1 at (6,9) with neck at (7,9). They CANNOT go up or right, and (5,9) is our body \u2014 so their only sane move is DOWN to (6,8). They\u2019re funneling down the right side. Good \u2014 they\u2019re not coming to trade heads with us this turn.\n\nRisk check: we are behind on apples (8 vs 11), so DO NOT force a head-on. We want mobility, not a suicide swing. Also avoid hugging edges that reduce escape routes.\n\nDecision: LEFT to (1,7).\nWhy? It\u2019s the safest, most flexible, and sets us up to grab the nearby apple at (1,6) on the next turn if we want to grow. LEFT preserves multiple escape routes so we can pivot later to cut the opponent when we\u2019re in a better apple position. We keep options open, avoid a risky meet-up with their forced-down movement, and position to start boxing them in from the left-side approach.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns): move LEFT now, then evaluate \u2014 likely drop to (1,6) for that apple, then snake back toward the center (2-3 cols) to start collapsing the space the opponent has on the right. Don\u2019t trade heads until we\u2019re ahead in apples; bait them into tighter columns while keeping two escape exits.\n\nLEFT",

If that cell clears, we keep the slither\u2011stream moving toward the cluster of low\u2011y apples and stay ahead of #0\u2019s 9 apples.  \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f **LONG\u2011TERM VISION**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep growing while #0 is still at 9 apples.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the downward corridor to funnel toward the dense apple patch at y\u202f=\u202f0\u20112.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 When we finally out\u2011size #0, wall\u2011trap him and force a head\u2011on crash.  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **CHAT, DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SAFE OPTIONS?**  \n- Nope \u2013 every other direction is a guaranteed death\u2011sentence.  \n- The only plausible escape is to trust that (6,6) will be cleared this turn and go **DOWN**.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 **PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS**  \n- Move DOWN \u2192 secure a fresh path toward the bottom\u2011row apples.  \n- Keep the head moving down until we hit an open column, then start weaving sideways to bag those low\u2011y apples.  \n- Keep an eye on #0\u2019s trajectory; he\u2019ll likely try to cut across the middle.  \n\n\ud83d\udc8e **FINAL CALL**  \nDOWN  \nDOWN",
