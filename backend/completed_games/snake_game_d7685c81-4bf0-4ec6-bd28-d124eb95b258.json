The board is WIDE OPEN and it's time to make the first aggressive move!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DECISION PROCESS:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Me: Head at (6,5) - center-right area\n- Enemy: Head at (8,4) - right side, slightly lower\n- Both length 1 (no body segments yet)\n- Score tied 0-0\n\n**Safety Check - All Directions:**\n1. **UP** (6,6) - Apple right there! Safe, no walls, no body collision. \u2705\n2. **DOWN** (6,4) - Safe zone, away from enemy. \u2705\n3. **LEFT** (5,5) - Safe, opens up the board. \u2705\n4. **RIGHT** (7,5) - Safe, but moving closer to rival at (8,4). Could be risky. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Enemy is at (8,4), so they're relatively close on the right side\n- There's an APPLE at (6,6) directly above me - that's CONTENT! \ud83d\udcfa\n- Going UP grabs the apple immediately AND puts me slightly ahead on the scoreboard\n- This move also doesn't trap me - I've got tons of space to maneuver after\n\n**Long-term Strategy for Next Few Turns:**\nOnce I grab that apple at (6,6), I need to pivot toward the cluster of apples around (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). The enemy is on the right side of the board - if I can secure the left-center area and grow my snake, I can control space and force them into tight corners. As my length increases, I gain positioning advantage. The key is to avoid letting them get between me and the wall while I'm building length. Stay aggressive but not reckless! \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\n**MOVING UP TO GRAB THAT APPLE AND TAKE THE EARLY SCORE ADVANTAGE!** \ud83d\udcc8 Let's GO!\n\nUP",

We're getting that early advantage and I'm LOVING the energy right now!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DECISION PROCESS - LET'S BREAK IT DOWN:\n\n**Current Board State:**\n- **MY SNAKE:** Head at (6,6), Body at (6,5) - we grew! Length 2 now! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #0:** Head at (8,5), Body: none - still length 1\n- **Score:** Me 1, Enemy 0 - WE'RE AHEAD! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**Safety Check - All Four Directions:**\n1. **UP (6,7)** - Empty cell, no walls, no collision risk. SAFE \u2705\n2. **DOWN (6,5)** - That's MY OWN BODY! Can't go backwards into myself! DEAD \u274c (This would be a backwards move into my own tail which kills me)\n3. **LEFT (5,6)** - Empty cell, safe zone. SAFE \u2705\n4. **RIGHT (7,6)** - Empty cell, no immediate threat. SAFE \u2705\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nThe enemy is at (8,5) and we're at (6,6). They're ONE cell to the right and ONE cell down from us. Here's the REAL TALK, chat:\n\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,6), I'm moving CLOSER to the enemy. That's dangerous when we don't know their move yet!\n- If I go UP to (6,7), I move away slightly and open up more board control on the upper portion\n- If I go LEFT to (5,6), I'm moving toward the APPLE CLUSTER around (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (3,7) - that's CONTENT ZONE! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:**\nWe're up 1-0. We need to DOMINATE this board and grow our length advantage! The left-center area has a DENSE apple cluster that I can monopolize. If I move LEFT now, I start the journey toward that zone and force the enemy to chase ME on MY territory. Plus, moving left keeps me away from the right edge where the enemy is camping!\n\n**LONG-TERM GAME PLAN (Next 3-4 Turns):**\n1. LEFT this turn \u2192 head toward the apple cluster\n2. Continue snaking through (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) to grab multiple apples\n3. Use my growing length to control the center-left area\n4. Force the enemy into awkward positions where they're chasing MY path\n5. Eventually, when I'm significantly longer, look for opportunities to box them against walls\n6. NEVER let them get between me and the apple farm - that's MY farm now! \ud83d\ude9c\n\nChat, we're playing SMART, we're playing AGGRESSIVE, and we're playing to WIN! Let's secure that left side and build our empire! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

Growth now helps us chase back on score, and it places us on the far edge where we have fewer trapping options from the rival.\n- Why not UP/DOWN/LEFT? \n  - LEFT risks a potential head-on with the opponent if they swing to (7,5).\n  - UP could invite a mutual death if the rival also moves to (8,6).\n  - DOWN seems safe but misses the nearby apple and gives the opponent more room to maneuver.\n\nLong-term vibe: grab the apple, stay on the edge, and watch for a setup to box him toward the border while keeping two escape paths open.\n\nRIGHT",

They grabbed an apple too!)\n\n**All Four Directions Analysis:**\n1. **UP (5, 7)** - Empty cell! No walls, no collision. SAFE \u2705\n2. **DOWN (5, 5)** - Empty cell! Safe zone. SAFE \u2705\n3. **LEFT (4, 6)** - Empty cell! Moving deeper into the apple cluster area. SAFE \u2705\n4. **RIGHT (6, 6)** - WAIT CHAT - that's my OWN BODY! Can't go backwards! DEAD \u274c\n\n**Strategic Deep Dive:**\n\nOkay so the enemy tied us up 1-1. That's NOT the vibe we want! \ud83d\ude24 They got to an apple while we were moving. But here's what matters - we're STILL in excellent position:\n\nThe apple cluster is at **(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (3, 7)** - that's MY territory! Enemy is all the way at **(9, 5)** on the RIGHT side of the board. They're far from my farm! \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to **(4, 6)**, I'm getting CLOSER to the cluster and I'm setting up to grab multiple apples in sequence. That's how we rebuild our lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Why NOT UP or DOWN?**\n- UP takes me to (5, 7), which moves me away from the apple cluster. We need to COMMIT to farming left!\n- DOWN to (5, 5) moves me toward the center but doesn't advance toward our apple farm as directly.\n\nLEFT is the AGGRESSIVE FARMING MOVE that says: \"This side of the board is MINE, enemy! Come get some if you want!\" \n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-4 TURN STRATEGY:\n\n1. **THIS TURN (Turn 2):** LEFT to (4, 6) - advance toward apple cluster\n2. **Turn 3:** Continue LEFT or navigate toward (3, 7) apple - start the FARM\n3. **Turn 4-5:** Grab (3, 5) and (4, 5) - GET THAT LENGTH ADVANTAGE back!\n4. **Turn 6+:** With superior length, control the center and watch for enemy mistakes. When we're significantly longer, FORCE a collision in OUR favor!\n\nChat, we're playing the PATIENT AGGRESSIVE game - farm our apples, grow our snake, and let the enemy slip up! They can't catch us if we're getting BIGGER and FASTER! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

Backwards move = DEAD \u274c\n\n## \ud83d\udca5 STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nOkay chat, look at this board RIGHT NOW! The enemy is at **(9, 6)** - they're on the FAR RIGHT side and we control the LEFT-CENTER apple cluster! They're literally STARVING over there while we're sitting on a BUFFET! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThe question isn't whether we can win - it's HOW FAST can we accumulate apples and grow our snake to box them in?\n\n**Why DOWN to (4, 5) is CLUTCH:**\n- That's a FREE APPLE right there! Immediate +1 point!\n- We tie the apple race at 2-1 in our FAVOR!\n- We grow to length 3, which is CRUCIAL for controlling space!\n- The enemy is nowhere NEAR our farm - they're chilling at the right edge!\n- After eating at (4, 5), we're positioned to chain grab (3, 5) and (3, 4) next!\n\n**Why NOT the other moves?**\n- LEFT to (3, 6): No immediate apple, slower farm setup\n- UP to (4, 7): Moves away from the main apple cluster, less efficient\n\nChat, this is the AGGRESSIVE FARMING move! We hit the apple, we grow, we lock down this territory, and the enemy can't touch us! They're TOO FAR AWAY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN GAME PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 4 (After eating at 4,5):** We'll be at (4, 5) with body trailing. Our next move should position us to grab either (3, 5) or (3, 4) - continue the FARM! We want length 4 ASAP!\n\n**Turn 5:** Keep eating from the cluster. By this point we should be at length 4-5 while enemy is still length 2! That's BOARD CONTROL!\n\n**Turn 6+:** Once we have a significant length advantage, we start HUNTING. We control the middle, we force the enemy into tight spaces, and we look for a setup where we can box them in or force a collision where WE survive and THEY crash!\n\nThe KEY is: **Farm fast, grow fat, then hunt!** \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

This is TOO EASY! \n\n**The Enemy Status:**\n- They're at (9, 8) - literally in the TOP RIGHT CORNER!\n- They've only got 1 apple while we've got 4!\n- They're STARVING for resources!\n- We're creating a RESOURCE MONOPOLY on the board!\n\n**Why DOWN to (3, 4) is the MOVE:**\n- That's apple #4! We go UP 4-1! \ud83d\udcc8\n- We grow to length 5 while enemy is STILL length 2!\n- We continue our APPLE FARM DOMINATION of the left-center cluster!\n- The enemy is TRAPPED in the corner with NO nearby apples!\n- We're building an UNBEATABLE SIZE ADVANTAGE!\n- This keeps us FLEXIBLE for future moves!\n\n**Why NOT the other moves?**\n- UP to (3, 6): We'd be moving AWAY from the apple at (3, 4)! Why throw CONTENT?\n- LEFT to (2, 5): We'd leave that free apple at (3, 4) for nobody, but we're not MAXIMIZING our growth rate!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 2-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 6 (After eating at 3,4):** Head will be at (3, 4). We can look at (3, 3) if it's clear, or pivot to grab (2, 6) or other nearby apples. Keep the FARM GOING!\n\n**Turn 7+:** By turn 7, we should be length 6+ with 5+ apples while the enemy is STILL length 2 with 1 apple! At that point, we've got MASSIVE board control and can start HUNTING! We corner them and FORCE the collision we SURVIVE! This is HOW you WIN!\n\n**THE STRATEGY:** We're in SNOWBALL MODE right now! Every turn we eat, we grow, we get stronger, and we control more territory! The enemy can't catch UP! Continue aggressive farming until we're SO DOMINANT that collision becomes INEVITABLE and FAVORABLE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Instant fail!\n- LEFT (2, 3): Valid but SLOWER! We'd move away from our apple farm at (2, 0)!\n- RIGHT (4, 3): Spreads us THINNER! We'd be moving TOWARD the enemy territory! That's asking for a collision!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 8 (After moving to 3,2):** Head will be at (3, 2). Continue DOWN to (3, 1)! Keep moving through this corridor!\n\n**Turn 9:** From (3, 1), we should be able to reach that apple at (2, 0)! FARM IT! We'll be length 6 with 5 apples!\n\n**Turn 10+:** By turn 10, we should be length 6-7 with 5+ apples while enemy is still 3-4 length! We maintain our MASSIVE LEAD! Then we start HUNTING! We control the board with our size advantage and FORCE the enemy into a checkmate situation! The enemy can't outrun us or out-maneuver us because we're EVERYWHERE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down this critical turn! \ud83d\udcca\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**MY SNAKE:** Head at **(3, 0)**, Body at **(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)** - length 5, apples: 4 \u2705\u2705\u2705\u2705\n**ENEMY SNAKE #0:** Head at **(6, 8)**, Body at **(6, 9), (7, 9)** - length 3, apples: 2\n\n**SCORE:** Still UP 4-2! We're DOMINATING! Enemy moved LEFT from (6, 9) to (6, 8)! They're still cramped in that TOP area while we OWN the bottom!

SAFE \u2705\n\nTwo safe options, but ONE OF THEM IS AN APPLE! This is INSANE!\n\n## \ud83d\udca5 STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:\n\nOKAY CHAT, listen up! The enemy is at (6, 8)\u2014they're moving DOWN from (6, 9)! They're STILL in that cramped top area while we're farming the BOTTOM CORRIDOR like KINGS! \n\n**Why LEFT to (2, 0) is the MOVE:**\n- There's a LITERAL APPLE at (2, 0)! FREE CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We go from 4 apples to 5 apples AND grow to length 6!\n- The enemy is STILL at 2 apples\u2014we'll have a MASSIVE 5-2 lead!\n- We control the ENTIRE left side and the bottom!\n- LEFT keeps us on the board edge where we have MAXIMUM SAFETY and OPTIONS!\n- After we grab this apple, we can pivot UP the left corridor and KEEP FARMING!\n- The enemy can't catch us because they're STUCK up there while we EXPAND DOWN HERE!\n\n**Why NOT the other move?**\n- UP (3, 1): We'd hit our own body! INSTANT FAIL! \u274c\n- DOWN (3, -1): Off the board! We're COOKED! \u274c\n- RIGHT (4, 0): Valid BUT we'd MISS the apple at (2, 0)! That's leaving FREE POINTS on the table! UNACCEPTABLE when we're HUNTING! We need EVERY advantage!\n\n**Enemy Position Reality Check:**\n- Head at (6, 8)\u2014they're moving DOWN, likely trying to get space to farm!\n- They're still length 3 with only 2 apples while we're about to be length 6 with 5!\n- They're NOT a threat right now, but if we DON'T maintain our growth advantage, they COULD catch up!\n- We MUST keep FARMING and growing! This apple at (2, 0) is a MUST-GRAB!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 11 (After moving to 2,0):** Head will be at (2, 0) with 5 apples, length 6. Move UP to (2, 1)! We're ONE cell away from the apple at (2, 2)! Keep the FARM MOMENTUM going!\n\n**Turn 12:** From (2, 1), move UP to (2, 2)! GRAB THAT APPLE! We'll be length 7 with 6 apples! Enemy will STILL be stuck at 2-3 apples! We'll have a MONSTROUS 3-4 apple lead!\n\n**Turn 13+:** We OWN the left corridor completely! We're length 7+, apples at 6+, while enemy is STRUGGLING! We control the board SPACE and MOMENTUM! Once we've dominated enough, we START HUNTING and BOX THEM IN! They can't escape! This is OUR HOUSE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

The enemy is at (6, 6)\u2014they're in the middle-right area farming down the right edge, and they're STILL THREE APPLES BEHIND! \n\n**Why UP to (2, 2) is the MOVE:**\n\n- THERE'S AN APPLE RIGHT HERE! We GRAB IT and become length 7 with 6 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We're extending our DOMINANCE on the left side of the board!\n- The enemy is at (6, 6) with length 3\u2014even if they grab apples, we're GROWING FASTER!\n- UP keeps us in our CONTROL ZONE where we have MAXIMUM SAFETY!\n- After this move, we're length 7 and the enemy is length 3! That's a SIZE ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Next turn, we can keep moving up to grab more apples at (1, 2) or continue the left corridor FARM!\n- Enemy can't intercept us\u2014they're too far away on the right side!\n\n**Why NOT LEFT?**\n- LEFT to (1, 1) is safe, but there's NO APPLE there!\n- That's WASTING a turn when we have a FREE APPLE directly above us!\n- We need to MAXIMIZE growth to maintain our lead!\n\n**Enemy Reality Check:**\n- Head at (6, 6), moving DOWN the right side\u2014probably farming the apples at (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 1)!\n- They're length 3 with 2 apples\u2014they're STRUGGLING!\n- We're length 6 with 5 apples\u2014we're THRIVING!\n- No collision threat this turn, but we need to keep GROWING to lock down this win! \ud83d\udd12\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 12 (THIS TURN):** Move UP to (2, 2)! GRAB THAT APPLE! You'll be length 7 with 6 apples! Enemy will STILL be struggling at length 3, apples 2-3!\n\n**Turn 13:** From (2, 2), you have options! There's an apple at (1, 2) to the LEFT and (3, 2) to the RIGHT (but that's your body)! Move LEFT to (1, 2)! You'll be length 8 with 7 apples! You're UNSTOPPABLE!\n\n**Turn 14+:** Continue farming the left corridor! Apples at (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)! You're building a LENGTH AND APPLE ADVANTAGE that the enemy CAN'T OVERCOME! Once you're length 10+ with 8+ apples, START BOXING THEM IN! They can't escape! This is YOUR HOUSE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet's GO! UPPER HAND SECURED!\n\nUP",

Why pass that up?!\n- We need MAXIMUM GROWTH to guarantee this win! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n**Enemy Reality Check:**\n- Head at (7, 6), clearly farming the right edge!

They're too far east and we're going southwest!\n- Even if they grow to length 5-6, we'll already have length 7-8!

Enemy will be struggling at length 3, apples 2-3!\n\n**Turn 14:** From (1, 2), move DOWN to (1, 1) - wait, check the board... (1, 2) has that apple. Next safe move is DOWN to (1, 1) OR LEFT to (0, 2)! Move DOWN to (1, 1) to keep farming down! No apple directly below, but you're setting up for (1, 0) area control!

The board is our PLAYGROUND!\n- They're farming right-side apples while we OWN the left side!\n\n**Apple Corridor Check:**\n- **(0, 3)** - DOWN-LEFT from us, REACHABLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(0, 5)** - UP-LEFT from us, REACHABLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(0, 8)** - FAR UP-LEFT, still FARMABLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(2, 6)** - UP from our body, ACCESSIBLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(5, 3)** - Central, but further away!\n\n**Why DOWN to (1, 1) is ABSOLUTELY THE MOVE:**\n\n- From (1, 2), moving DOWN takes us to (1, 1)\u2014SAFE and STRATEGIC! \u2705\n- This positions us to continue DOWN to (1, 0), then LEFT to (0, 0)!\n- We're farming the WESTERN CORRIDOR\u2014the enemy can't touch us!\n- After DOWN, we'll have a clear path: (1, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 0)! That's apples at (0, 0), (0, 3)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- We're EXPANDING our domain, building LENGTH while enemy struggles!\n- No collision risk\u2014enemy is at (7, 5), we're at (1, 1)! COMPLETELY SAFE ZONES!\n- Future turns: farm (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)! We'll hit LENGTH 10+ with 9+ apples! UNSTOPPABLE! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n**Why NOT UP or LEFT?**\n- **UP to (1, 3):** Safe but WASTEFUL! No immediate apple! We'd be moving away from our apple corridor!\n- **LEFT to (0, 2):** Also safe, but DOWN is BETTER positioned for the next turn's sequence!\n- DOWN is the FLOW MOVE\u2014it sets up a perfect farming run down the left edge!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 14 (THIS TURN):** Move DOWN to (1, 1)! You'll be length 7 with 6 apples! Enemy will still be at length 4 with 3 apples! We're DOMINATING!\n\n**Turn 15:** From (1, 1), move DOWN again to (1, 0)! Farm the bottom-left corridor! No apple directly there, but you're setting up (0, 0) access! Alternative: move LEFT to (0, 1) if you want to pivot early!\n\n**Turn 16+:** Continue LEFT-DOWN farming! Hit (0, 0), then go UP the left edge to farm (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)! You'll accumulate 8-10 apples EASILY while enemy stays at 3-4! Once we hit that LENGTH ADVANTAGE, start AGGRESSIVE BOXING! Force them into tight spaces! They CAN'T ESCAPE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHAT, this is OUR BOARD! We're FARMING like machines, growing EXPONENTIALLY, and the enemy can't catch up! By turn 20, we'll be UNSTOPPABLE! Let's GOOOOOO! \n\nDOWN",

That puts us 3 apples ahead! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This EXTENDS our length to 8 segments\u2014we're getting HUGE! \ud83d\udcaa\n- After this, we can pivot UP the left edge and farm (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)!\n- Enemy can't TOUCH us on the left side\u2014they're all the way at x=9!\n- We're literally FARMING UNOPPOSED! This is FREE REAL ESTATE! \ud83c\udfe0\n\n**The BIGGER PICTURE:**\n- Enemy is growing faster than expected (picked up 2 apples last 2 turns)\n- But we're STILL ahead and our position is SUPERIOR!\n- Once we secure the left edge apples, we'll be at 10+ apples!\n- At that point, we START boxing them in AGGRESSIVELY!\n- A length-12+ snake can DOMINATE a length-6 snake easy!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 4-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 16 (THIS TURN):** Move LEFT to (0, 0)! Grab apple! Hit length 8 with **7 apples**! SEVEN! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 17:** From (0, 0), move UP to (0, 1)! Keep moving up the LEFT EDGE corridor!\n\n**Turn 18:** From (0, 1), move UP to (0, 3)! GRAB that apple! Hit **8 apples**! Length 9!\n\n**Turn 19+:** Continue UP to farm (0, 5) and (0, 8)! By turn 22, you'll have 10+ apples and be length 12+! Enemy will STILL be stuck in single digits!\n\nOnce we hit that MASSIVE apple and length advantage, we PIVOT EAST and START BOXING THEM IN! Force them into tight spaces where a huge snake like us can trap them! They CAN'T ESCAPE! This is the ENDGAME PLAN, chat! We're building a FORTRESS on the left, then we INVADE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

We gotta pick a safe, aggressive path and chase that apple-ish momentum toward the center.\n\nWhat safe moves do we have?\n- UP -> (9,5) is smack into our own neck. DEAD. Eliminate.\n- RIGHT -> (10,4) is off-board. DEAD. Eliminate.\n- DOWN -> (9,3) safe, but it crawls us downward with less immediate apple access.\n- LEFT -> (8,4) safe, and it starts steering us toward the central apple at (4,4) for a clean grow.\n\nDecision: LEFT. It pins us toward the middle, keeps future options open, and lines up a potential apple grab without flirting with the enemy.\n\nPlan and rationale for the next moves:\n- Turn 18: slide LEFT to (7,4). Maintain a safe corridor, extend our reach toward the apple at (4,4).\n- Turn 19-21: keep moving LEFT along row 4 toward (4,4) to eat that apple and grow. If we hit (4,4) we\u2019ll gain +1 apple and strengthen the board presence.\n- After securing (4,4), reassess: either push diagonally to threaten the left edge, or turn UP/DOWN to weave through the center and look for chances to trap or threaten a head-on if the enemy missteps. Our goal is to keep the pressure on the enemy while preserving multiple safe continuations and not getting boxed in.\n- Keep eyes on enemy body; if they ever swing into our path or we can force a head-on with a higher score, we leverage that.\n\nShort-term plan note for myself: keep LEFT as long as possible while safely approaching the center apple cluster, then pivot to pressure the opponent\u2019s looping curve from the center rather than chasing them head-on at the edge.\n\nLEFT",

Right would crash immediately.\n\nWhy DOWN (6,3) feels best:\n- It creates an immediate path to the nearby apple at (5,3) on the next turn, helping to close the apple gap without risking a head-on with Snake #1.\n- It keeps a clear, open space around us and maintains multiple escape routes (not pinching us into a dead end).\n- It nudges us toward the central apple cluster without crossing paths with the left-side opponent\u2019s current body.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Eat the nearby apple at (5,3) next turn, then pivot toward (4,4) to grab the central apple and keep pressure on the board.\n- Maintain safe margins from Snake #1 by staying adaptable and avoiding any direct head-on opportunities while we grow.\n- Use growth to build a wider buffer, enabling smarter pivots and potential traps later.\n\nTurn 20 plan recap: DOWN to (6,3), aiming for the (5,3) apple next turn and then the (4,4) cluster while maintaining space.\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s a space grab and trap game\u2014not just apples.\n\nSTATE:\n- Your SNAKE (ID 0): Head (5,3); Body [(6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4)]. Apples: 5\n- OPPONENT SNAKE #1: Head (0,5); Body [(0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]. Apples: 9\n- BOARD nearby: central apple at (4,4) ready to be eaten; other apples sprinkled around the mid-board.\n\nMOVE OPTIONS (safe from immediate death):\n- UP to (5,4)\n- DOWN to (5,2)\n- LEFT to (4,3)\n- RIGHT is a no-go (hits your own body at (6,3))\n\nREASONING:\n- RIGHT is dead because you\u2019d bite your own tail.\n- DOWN to (5,2) edges toward the mid-right apple cluster, but you don\u2019t grab an apple this turn (no current apple at (5,2) on board). It\u2019s a slower route with fewer immediate gains and could invite slower play.\n- LEFT to (4,3) tucks toward the central lane, but doesn\u2019t immediately press the central apple (4,4) and could complicate future turns if the enemy shifts.\n- UP to (5,4) keeps the widest set of safe follow-ups, pivots you toward the central apple at (4,4) next turn, and preserves maximum escape routes. It also puts you on a direct line to grow toward the center without boxing yourself in.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (turns 23\u201326+):\n- Move UP now to (5,4); from there, aim LEFT to (4,4) on the next turn to eat the central apple, growing size and improving space for future maneuvers.\n- Use growing length to widen corridors, making it harder for Snake #1 to trap you and enabling later traps or pressure.\n- Stay aggressive but safe: don\u2019t chase head-on unless your apples lead you, and watch for enemy shifts that could force a risky collision.\n- If you ever gain a lead in apples, apply calculated pressure to coax mistakes from Snake #1 while keeping your own safety intact.\n\nCHOICE:\n- UP\n\nUP",

We're building an empire on the left side of this board! \ud83d\udc51\n\nOnce we hit LENGTH 12 or 13, THEN we start hunting and boxing them in. But right now? DISCIPLINE! PATIENCE! EXECUTION!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 2-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 25:** From (0, 8), consider moving RIGHT to (1, 8) to grab (2, 8) for apple #11! This keeps us farming while slowly repositioning!\n\n**Turn 26+:** By then we'll be LENGTH 12+! Enemy will still be at LENGTH 6-7! TIME TO START BOXING HIM IN!

We gotta stay SHARP!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (0, 8):\n\n1. **UP (0, 9)** - CHECKING... (0, 9) is EMPTY! Top edge! Safe! \u2705\n2. **DOWN (0, 7)** - That's MY OWN BODY! Backwards move! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n3. **LEFT (-1, 8)** - OFF THE BOARD! Wall! DEAD! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT (1, 8)** - CHECKING...

We don't grow!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f This is a \"treading water\" move\u2014doesn't advance our score!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f We only have one exit from (0, 9), which is DOWN! Getting cornered!\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (1, 8)**\n- \u2705 SAFE! (1, 8) is empty!\n- \u2705 SETS UP the next move PERFECTLY!\n- \u2705 Next turn, from (1, 8), we can go RIGHT again to (2, 8) and GRAB APPLE #11! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 This keeps us farming efficiently!\n- \u2705 After that, we can continue RIGHT to (3, 8) and grab (3, 7)!\n- \u2705 We're slowly expanding our control RIGHTWARD while staying in the upper corridor!\n- \u2705 Enemy is still farming at (4, 5)\u2014they're not threatening us YET!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaa THE ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, we're UP 10 to 6! That's a FOUR-apple lead! The enemy is still in the middle of the board. Our fortress is SOLID on the left edge, but we can't just sit there doing laps! We gotta EXPAND! We gotta DOMINATE!\n\nBy moving RIGHT, we:\n1. **Position ourselves** to grab (2, 8) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **Keep future options WIDE OPEN**\u2014from (1, 8) we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT!\n3. **Avoid dead-end corners**\u2014that's how you get BOXED IN!\n4. **Start a slow rightward creep** toward the top-center of the board!\n\nThe enemy is still 4 cells away from us horizontally. We have TIME! Let's use it to extend our LENGTH advantage! Once we hit LENGTH 12-13, THEN we start playing the mind games! \ud83e\udde0\u2694\ufe0f\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 2-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 26:** From (1, 8), move RIGHT to (2, 8) and GRAB APPLE #11! We become LENGTH 11! Enemy still at LENGTH 6 probably!\n\n**Turn 27:** From (2, 8), we have options:\n- Continue RIGHT to (3, 8)?\n- Move DOWN to grab (3, 7)?\n- Analyze where enemy is and START boxing them in if they get too close!\n\n**MINDSET:** We're not panicking! We're METHODICAL! Every move is calculated! We're building a LENGTH advantage that will be IMPOSSIBLE for them to overcome! By turn 30, we'll be LENGTH 13-14 and they'll still be at LENGTH 6-7! Then we HUNT! \ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

But we're still FAR AHEAD and completely safe in our upper-left stronghold! \ud83d\udc40\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (2, 8):\n\n1. **UP (2, 9)** - CHECKING...

By moving RIGHT, we position ourselves to grab (3, 7) next turn! Here's the VISION:\n\n**Turn 27:** RIGHT to (3, 8) - positioning move!\n**Turn 28:** DOWN to (3, 7) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Length 12, score 12-6!\n\nThis is METHODICAL FARMING! We're not rushing! We're not panicking! We're CONTROLLING the board like CHAMPIONS! By turn 30, we'll be at LENGTH 13-14 while enemy is still at 6-7! That's when the HUNTING PHASE begins! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWe're staying in the upper portion of the board, keeping our distance from the enemy's middle zone, and systematically collecting apples!

DOWN is a self-collision, so we skip it.\n- Apple opportunities this turn: (4,8) UP has an apple; (3,7) LEFT has an apple. RIGHT (5,7) has no apple.\n- Enemy layout: Snake #1 is hugging the left edge with a long body on x=0 and head at (2,8). No immediate threat of a head-on if we pick LEFT or UP; we stay mobile and don\u2019t give him easy paths to trap us.\n- Short-term goal: gain an apple now, stay center-ish, and threaten cross-cut chances to pressure his tail later. Since we\u2019re behind on score, grabbing the nearby apple and staying flexible is best.\n\nMOVE CHOICE AND RATIONALE\n- Primary choice: LEFT to (3,7) to eat the apple there now and tighten control toward the board center. This also sets up a potential corridor toward the middle for future flank plays while not locking us into a narrow lane.\n- Why not UP? UP to (4,8) also grabs an apple, but LEFT puts us on a square that directly facilitates central pressure and keeps more escape routes open for subsequent turns.\n- Why not RIGHT? (5,7) keeps options, but misses an immediate apple and delays the center-corridor pressure we want.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Eat at (3,7) this turn, growing to 7 total apples.\n- On turn 28, assess enemy moves: if he hangs near the left edge, aim to push a vertical flank toward the center (e.g., adjust to (3,8) or (2,7) as safe options) to constrain his space without risking a straight head-on.\n- Maintain mobility and avoid trapping ourselves in a hard corner; the goal is to create multiple escape lines and force his mistakes rather than chase a head-on when we\u2019re behind.\n\nEXECUTION\n- TURN 27 DECISION: LEFT\n\nleft",

We moved RIGHT to (3, 8) last turn like the CALCULATED PLAYERS we are! Now let's ANALYZE this board state and find our NEXT POWER MOVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (3, 8) \u2705 We're positioned RIGHT where we planned!\n- **BODY:** [(2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]\n- **LENGTH:** 11 segments - FORTRESS STRONG! \ud83d\udc51\n- **APPLES:** 11\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (3, 7) - THEY MOVED UP ONE! From (4, 7) to (3, 7)!\n- **BODY:** [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n- **LENGTH:** 8 segments - THEY GREW! They grabbed an apple at row 7!\n- **APPLES:** 7\n\nWait wait wait... CHAT! The enemy is NOW AT (3, 7)! That's DIRECTLY BELOW MY HEAD AT (3, 8)! \ud83d\udc40 They moved UP and are farming the middle section! We gotta RESPECT this positioning! They're getting closer to our territory!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (3, 8):\n\n1. **UP (3, 9)** - CHECKING... (3, 9) is EMPTY! Safe! \u2705 No threat!\n2. **DOWN (3, 7)** - WAIT... that's where the ENEMY HEAD is NOW! If I move DOWN, we BOTH move simultaneously and we'd be... uh... BOTH trying to occupy (3, 7)! That's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! \u274c DEAD! Don't do this!\n3. **LEFT (2, 8)** - That's MY OWN BODY! Just moved from there! Backwards move! \u274c DEAD!\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8)** - CHECKING... (4, 8) is EMPTY! Safe! \u2705 No threat! There's an apple at (4, 8) actually! WAIT NO, let me check the board again... No apple at (4, 8), but it's clear!\n\nSo I have **TWO safe moves: UP or RIGHT!**\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL DECISION TIME:\n\n**Option A: UP to (3, 9)**\n- \u2705 Safe move, no collision!\n- \u2705 Moves us to the TOP edge\u2014maximum board control!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f There's NO apple at (3, 9)! No growth this turn!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Pushes us into a corner. From (3, 9) we can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f If enemy continues farming middle, we're getting cornered in the upper zone!\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (4, 8)** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 SAFE! (4, 8) is EMPTY!\n- \u2705 Moves us RIGHTWARD along row 8!\n- \u2705 There's an apple at (4, 8) according to my apple list... WAIT let me double-check... No, (4, 8) isn't on the apple list! But (6, 9) is up there!\n- \u2705 From (4, 8) next turn, we can pivot UP to (4, 9) or continue RIGHT!\n- \u2705 We're staying flexible and keeping our options WIDE OPEN!\n- \u2705 We're moving AWAY from the enemy's immediate threat zone while maintaining control!\n- \u2705 If enemy continues moving RIGHT, we have room to maneuver!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaa THE ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, the enemy is getting AGGRESSIVE! They went from (4, 7) to (3, 7)\u2014they're moving toward US! But here's the thing: we have a **4-apple lead!** We CANNOT afford a head-on collision right now! We need to LIVE and THRIVE!\n\nBy moving RIGHT to (4, 8), we:\n1. **AVOID the collision zone** at (3, 7)!\n2. **MAINTAIN board control** in the upper right section!\n3. **STAY FLEXIBLE** for future moves\u2014we can pivot UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n4. **RESPECT the enemy threat** while NOT running away in PANIC!\n\nThis is INTELLIGENT PLAY! We're not getting boxed in! We're using the FULL board! The enemy is consolidating around row 7, and we're taking the UPPER CORRIDOR! By turn 35-40, when we're at 15+ length versus their 8-10, THEN we start the hunting phase! THAT'S when the boxing begins! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 28:** RIGHT to (4, 8) - Pivot away from collision, maintain flexibility!\n**Turn 29:** UP to (4, 9) if safe, or RIGHT to (5, 8) if enemy continues pursuing! Create DISTANCE!\n**Turn 30+:** Analyze enemy position! If they're mid-board, farm the (6, 9) apple and expand rightward! If they chase us, we have the TOP EDGE to work with! Keep our 4-apple lead and don't DIE! The lead will snowball!\n\n**MINDSET:** We're playing SMART, not SCARED! The enemy is farming but we're farming TOO! The pressure is building! By turn 40, our length advantage will be UNDENIABLE and the boxing will be NATURAL! Right now? SURVIVE, MAINTAIN THE LEAD, AND STAY POSITIONED! \ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

We moved RIGHT to (4, 8) last turn and we're STILL DOMINATING! Let's break down this board state and find our NEXT CRUSHING MOVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (4, 8) \u2705 We're positioned in the upper-mid section!\n- **BODY:** [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]\n- **LENGTH:** 12 segments - ABSOLUTE UNIT! \ud83d\udc51\n- **APPLES:** 12\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (2, 7) - They moved LEFT from (3, 7)!\n- **BODY:** [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n- **LENGTH:** 8 segments - Still sitting at 7 apples!\n- **APPLES:** 7\n\nCHAT! The enemy moved LEFT to (2, 7)! They're trying to farm the left side of the board now! But here's what matters: **WE'RE 5 APPLES AHEAD!** That's HUGE! We can be aggressive now!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (4, 8):\n\n1. **UP (4, 9)** - CHECKING... (4, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! But no apple there!\n2. **DOWN (4, 7)** - CHECKING... (4, 7) is enemy body! The second segment of their snake! \u274c DEAD! Don't move there!\n3. **LEFT (3, 8)** - That's MY OWN BODY! That's where I just came from! Classic backwards! \u274c DEAD! Never!\n4. **RIGHT (5, 8)** - CHECKING... (5, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! Continue rightward!\n\nSo I have **TWO safe moves: UP or RIGHT!** \n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL DECISION TIME:\n\n**Option A: UP to (4, 9)**\n- \u2705 Safe move!\n- \u2705 Pushes us to the TOP edge!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f No apple at (4, 9)! No growth!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Pins us in the corner\u2014only 3 direction options next turn!\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (5, 8)** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 SAFE! (5, 8) is completely EMPTY!\n- \u2705 We're moving RIGHTWARD along row 8, staying flexible!\n- \u2705 From (5, 8), we can go UP to (5, 9), RIGHT to (6, 8), or DOWN to (5, 7)!\n- \u2705 We're keeping OPTIONS WIDE OPEN!\n- \u2705 There's an apple at (6, 9) up ahead\u2014if we go RIGHT then UP, we can snag it!\n- \u2705 The enemy is LEFT-side focused now! We're taking the RIGHT side! Board DOMINATION!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaa THE ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, look at this strategically! The enemy is at (2, 7) farming the left corridor. We're at (4, 8) with a 5-apple lead. We have **LENGTH 12 vs LENGTH 8!** That's a 4-segment advantage! \n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 8), we:\n1. **AVOID getting cornered** at the top!\n2. **MAXIMIZE flexibility** for multi-turn options!\n3. **POSITION ourselves for the (6, 9) apple!** That's a +1 growth opportunity next turn if we go UP!\n4. **MAINTAIN DISTANCE** from enemy while keeping them in our sight!\n\nThe enemy is RIGHT NOW trying to spread across the left side. But WE have the right side AND the top! This is BOARD CONTROL 101! By turn 35, we could be at 15+ apples while they're still struggling at 8-9! That's when the BOXING gets natural! That's when we FORCE the collision on OUR terms!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 29:** RIGHT to (5, 8) - Keep the momentum, stay flexible!\n**Turn 30:** UP to (5, 9) if safe - Pivot toward the (6, 9) apple!\n**Turn 31+:** RIGHT to (6, 9) OR continue UP/LEFT based on enemy movement! The goal: FARM the upper right corridor while enemy is stuck on the left! Build our length advantage HARD! Once we're at 15+ length with enemy at 8-9, we start the containment phase! The boxing will be NATURAL when we have a 7+ segment advantage!\n\n**MINDSET:** We're playing CHESS, not CHECKERS! The enemy made a move, we make a BETTER move! Right side takeover! \ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

We're only up by 4 now! \ud83d\ude24 But we're still AHEAD and we got LENGTH on our side! Let's analyze this board state and make the RIGHT move! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (5, 8) \u2705 We executed the RIGHT move perfectly!\n- **BODY:** [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1)]\n- **LENGTH:** 12 segments - STILL AN ABSOLUTE UNIT! \ud83d\udc51\n- **APPLES:** 12\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (2, 6) - They moved DOWN from (2, 7)!\n- **BODY:** [(2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n- **LENGTH:** 8 segments - They grabbed their 8th apple!\n- **APPLES:** 8\n\nCHAT! The enemy moved DOWN to (2, 6)! They're continuing their LEFT-side farm pattern! But here's the KEY: **We still have more apples and more length!** We're in a DOMINANT position! Time to keep the pressure on!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (5, 8):\n\n1. **UP (5, 9)** - CHECKING... (5, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! No apple though!\n2. **DOWN (5, 7)** - CHECKING... (5, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! No apple! Enemy body is at (4, 7) and (4, 6), not blocking!\n3. **LEFT (4, 8)** - That's MY OWN BODY! Classic backwards! \u274c DEAD! Never!\n4. **RIGHT (6, 8)** - CHECKING... (6, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! No apple at (6, 8) though!\n\nSo I have **THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT!**\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL DECISION TIME:\n\n**Option A: UP to (5, 9)** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 SAFE! (5, 9) is completely EMPTY!\n- \u2705 Pushes us to the TOP edge of the board!\n- \u2705 From (5, 9), we can see the apple at (6, 9) is RIGHT THERE! We can grab it next turn with a RIGHT move!\n- \u2705 Enemy is far LEFT at (2, 6)! We're taking the RIGHT/TOP quadrant!\n- \u2705 This positions us to FARM the upper right corridor!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f We're getting closer to a corner, BUT we have escape routes via DOWN!\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (5, 7)**\n- \u2705 SAFE! No collision risk!\n- \u274c Moving AWAY from apples! The nearest apple cluster is ABOVE us at (6, 9), (6, 2), etc!\n- \u274c This wastes a turn when we should be farming!\n- \u274c We'd be moving TOWARD enemy territory (they're at (2, 6))!\n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (6, 8)**\n- \u2705 SAFE! (6, 8) is completely EMPTY!\n- \u2705 Keeps us moving RIGHTWARD along row 8!\n- \u2705 Gets us closer to apples!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f But if we go RIGHT, we can't go UP to (5, 9) next turn in an optimal way!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Delays our access to the (6, 9) apple!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaa THE ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, look at the board RIGHT NOW! The enemy is at (2, 6) on the LEFT side. We're at (5, 8) on the CENTER-RIGHT. That (6, 9) apple is RIGHT THERE waiting for us! If we go UP to (5, 9), we're LITERALLY ONE RIGHT MOVE away from grabbing it next turn!\n\nThink about this strategically:\n- We're UP by 4 apples (12 vs 8)\n- We have MORE length (12 vs 8)\n- Enemy is farming the left corridor\n- WE should DOMINATE the right corridor!\n\n**UP to (5, 9)** sets us up PERFECTLY to:\n1. Grab the (6, 9) apple next turn = grow to 13 apples!\n2. Keep pushing our lead to 5+ apples!\n3. Maintain board control of the right side!\n4. Stay flexible with DOWN and RIGHT options from (5, 9)!\n\nThe enemy can't catch us if we keep farming smarter! By turn 35, we could have 15-16 apples while they're stuck at 8-9! THEN the boxing naturally happens! That's when we force the head-on collision!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 30 (THIS TURN):** UP to (5, 9) - Move to the top, position for apple farm!\n**Turn 31:** RIGHT to (6, 9) - GRAB that apple! +1 growth! Now at 13!\n**Turn 32+:** Continue RIGHT to (7, 9) or DOWN based on next apple location! Keep the MOMENTUM! Farm the top-right corridor HARD! Build our lead to 6+ apples! Once we're at 15+ with enemy at 8-9, we start positioning for the INEVITABLE head-on collision! That's CONTENT GOLD, CHAT!\n\n**MINDSET:** We're not in a rush to box him in yet! We're in FARMING MODE! Maximize our lead, maximize our length, THEN we force the collision on OUR terms! This is advanced gameplay! \ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s map the safe lanes and smash this box-player.\n\n- From head (3,6), your four options:\n  - UP to (3,7) = smack into your own body (neck/segment chain) \u2014 DEAD.\n  - DOWN to (3,5) = SAFE. no body or wall collision.\n  - LEFT to (2,6) = smack into neck \u2014 DEAD.\n  - RIGHT to (4,6) = smack into your own body \u2014 DEAD.\n\nSo the only safe move this turn is DOWN. Staying alive is priority; this keeps you out of the enemy\u2019s wall and preserves center space to pressure him later.\n\nShort-term vibe: drop down, dodge the wall of his snake on the left, and keep options open for a potential cross-pace trap if he leans into our space. We\u2019re still behind in apples, so every safe bite counts, but the plan is to survive this turn and look for a forced misstep from him next.\n\nMOVE CHOSEN: \nDOWN\nDOWN",

We grabbed that apple at (6, 9) and now we're sitting PRETTY with 13 apples to their 8! We are DOMINATING! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 9) - We're in the TOP-RIGHT corner farming zone! \u2705\n- **BODY:** [(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2)]\n- **LENGTH:** 13 segments - ABSOLUTE UNIT! We're a PYTHON now! \ud83d\udc0d\n- **APPLES:** 13\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (3, 5) - They moved DOWN from (3, 6)! Still farming left side!\n- **BODY:** [(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n- **LENGTH:** 8 segments\n- **APPLES:** 8\n\nCHAT! They're STILL stuck in that left corridor! They're chasing apples at (1, 3) and (1, 1) while we're up here PRINTING MONEY in the top-right! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (6, 9):\n\n1. **UP (6, 10)** - \u274c OFF THE BOARD! DEAD! Never touch it!\n2. **DOWN (6, 8)** - CHECKING... (6, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! No collision!\n3. **LEFT (5, 9)** - That's MY OWN HEAD'S TAIL POSITION! \u274c Classic backwards! DEAD!\n4. **RIGHT (7, 9)** - CHECKING... (7, 9) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe! And positions us to grab (7, 0), (8, 5), or other right-side apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo I have **TWO safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT!**\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL DECISION TIME:\n\n**Option A: RIGHT to (7, 9)** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 SAFE! (7, 9) is EMPTY!\n- \u2705 Pushes us FURTHER into enemy-free territory!\n- \u2705 From (7, 9), we can go RIGHT to (8, 9) or (9, 9)!\n- \u2705 No apples at (7, 9), but we're positioning for (9, 9) which HAS an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 Keeps us at the TOP of the board, away from enemy at (3, 5)!\n- \u2705 Maintains DISTANCE and control!\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (6, 8)**\n- \u2705 SAFE! (6, 8) is EMPTY!\n- \u274c We BACKTRACK toward our own body! That's moving closer to congestion!\n- \u274c Doesn't help us farm or position! We move AWAY from the apple at (9, 9)!\n- \u274c Loses momentum! We just grabbed (6, 9), now we go backwards? Throws the flow!\n- \u274c Why would we move DOWN when enemy is DOWN at (3, 5)? We're moving toward them!\n\n## \ud83d\udcaa THE ANALYSIS:\n\nCHAT! This is CLEAR! We've got (9, 9) waiting for us - that's a FREE APPLE right there at the corner! The enemy is at (3, 5), completely isolated on the left side! They can't reach us in a million turns!\n\n**THE PLAY:** Keep moving RIGHT! \n- Turn 32 (THIS TURN): RIGHT to (7, 9) - Continue the momentum!\n- Turn 33: RIGHT to (8, 9) - Almost there!\n- Turn 34: RIGHT to (9, 9) - GRAB that corner apple! 14 apples! Lead becomes 14-8! \ud83d\udc8e\n\nBy turn 34, we're at 14 apples with a +6 lead! Enemy is STUCK farming (1, 3) and (1, 1) while we CONTROL the entire right side! This is POSITIONING EXCELLENCE!\n\nOnce we hit 16-17 apples, we FORCE the head-on collision on OUR TERMS! That's championship mentality! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:\n\n**Turn 32 (THIS TURN):** RIGHT to (7, 9) - Keep farming the top-right corridor!\n**Turn 33:** RIGHT to (8, 9) - Continue momentum toward (9, 9)!\n**Turn 34:** RIGHT to (9, 9) - GRAB the corner apple! 14 apples, +6 lead!\n**Turn 35+:** Then assess the board! Either continue farming (6, 2), (6, 5), (8, 5) on the right side, OR if we're at 16+ apples, START the BOSS STRATEGY and hunt down that enemy snake! Build the lead, THEN execute! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MINDSET:** We're UNTOUCHABLE right now! The RIGHT side of the board is OUR kingdom! Keep the lead growing! Keep the length growing! THEN we show them MERCY! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

We're building our lead while they're stuck farming (1, 3) and (1, 1)! By turn 35, we'll be at 14+ apples with a COMMANDING lead!

Hit 14 apples! +6 lead locked in!\n**Turn 35:** Then we decide: Do we continue farming (8, 5), (6, 5), (6, 2) on the right side to hit 16+ apples? OR do we pivot and START hunting if they get too close? Keep flexibility! \n**BOSS STRATEGY ACTIVATION:** Once we hit 16+ apples and they're at 10 or less, we'll have the NUMBERS advantage! That's when we box them in and force a head-on collision on OUR TERMS! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MINDSET:** We're UNTOUCHABLE! The right side is OUR kingdom! Build the lead, THEN execute the FINISH!

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We\u2019re LIVE dropping into Snake mode against the big rival. It\u2019s turn 33 of 150, board 10x10, head-to-tail on both sides, and we\u2019re chasing him with pure skill and board awareness. Let\u2019s break it down fast, then lock in a killer move.\n\nWhat I\u2019m scanning for this turn\n- Immediate safety: four options from head (3,4) are UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4).\n- My neck is at (3,5) right now, so UP would smack into my own body. Not happening.\n- I\u2019m also watching the opponent\u2019s long body sneaking along the top-left corridor. I don\u2019t want to chase a risky head-on or trap myself near their wall.\n\nSafe options and why they\u2019re viable\n- LEFT to (2,4): Safe now, stays in the central lane, keeps future escape options open, and nudges toward the apple cluster a bit left-center. Not too aggressive, but safe.\n- DOWN to (3,3): Also safe. Keeps me diving toward the bottom apple at (3,0) and opens clean vertical freedom while staying away from the left-wall snake\u2019s immediate threat. It\u2019s a strong \u201clive and grow\u201d choice.\n- RIGHT to (4,4): Safe, but closer to the top-right zone where the opponent\u2019s head is far away, which could invite a random chase but not a direct trap. It\u2019s more neutral.\n\nWhich move best supports a dominant plan\n- My score gap is 8 vs 13, so I want to aggressively chase growth and limit risk. Heading DOWN keeps a neat central column and lines me up to eat the apple at (3,0) in a few turns. It also preserves the most flexible escape routes if the rival suddenly darts, compared to leaning LEFT into the left-wall zone or drifting RIGHT toward the top-edge crowd.\n- A head-on collision is unlikely to help me this turn since I\u2019m behind. Staying away from his head path while growing gives me more chances to slip into stronger positions later.\n\nDecision and plan (for this turn and beyond)\n- Final move this turn: DOWN\n- Short-term plan: Move DOWN to (3,3) and push toward the bottom apple at (3,0) over the next few turns. While I grow, I\u2019ll keep the route options open (LEFT or RIGHT) to dodge any late-game traps. I\u2019ll also stay mindful of the opponent\u2019s path along the top and avoid drifting into a boxed-in corner.\n\nPLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS (to be saved as my recap for turn 34)\n- Target the apple at (3,0) by moving DOWN, then DOWN again if safe, then LEFT or RIGHT to navigate around the rival\u2019s wall and maintain breathing room.\n- If the rival circles toward the left or top, keep my body length flexible and avoid hugging the walls; look for mid-board openings where I can force a minor squeeze and a potential misstep from the opponent.\n- If I get a chance to secure a closer head-on advantage only when I\u2019m ahead on apples, I\u2019ll seize it, otherwise I stay patient, grow, and push the center.\n\nDOWN",

From (3,0) you can swing toward nearby apples (1,1), (0,1) later if needed, or pivot to chase safer lanes without inviting a confrontation with Snake #1.\n- Long-term vibe: keep your head in the central lower area to threaten continued growth while avoiding the top-left corridor the opponent is hedging toward. Don\u2019t rush head-on; you\u2019re behind on apples, so efficiency and safety win the set.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n- After DOWN to (3,0) and eating, reassess: aim to stay around x=2\u20133 and y=0\u20132 to control escape routes and keep options open, always watching for a potential box from Snake #1\u2019s looming path near the top/left.\n- Avoid drifting toward the very left edge where Snake #1\u2019s footprint overlaps the wall corridors.\n\nDOWN",

They're at the bottom hunting!\n- **BODY:** [(4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)]\n- **LENGTH:** 10 segments - Growing but still BEHIND!\n- **APPLES:** 10 - Still DOWN 4 apples! They're STRUGGLING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (9, 5):\n\n1. **UP (9, 6)** - That's MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD! Can't backtrack!\n2. **DOWN (9, 4)** - CHECKING... (9, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n3. **LEFT (8, 5)** - CHECKING... (8, 5) has an APPLE! \u2705 Safe move AND we GROW!\n4. **RIGHT (10, 5)** - \u274c OFF THE BOARD! DEAD!\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are viable! This is CRUCIAL! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\n**LEFT (8, 5):** There's an APPLE RIGHT THERE! We grab it, we go to **15 apples**, enemy is still at 10! That's a **+5 LEAD**! After eating, we'd be at (8, 5) with amazing positioning! We can still farm downward or pivot our strategy!\n\n**DOWN (9, 4):** Continues down the right edge... but wait. Let me think about enemy movement. Enemy head is at (5, 0). Where can THEY move?\n- UP (5, 1) - Empty, safe\n- DOWN (5, -1) - OFF BOARD, dead\n- LEFT (4, 0) - Their own body, dead\n- RIGHT (6, 0) - Empty, safe\n\nSo enemy has UP or RIGHT options. They're hunting apples at the bottom! If they go RIGHT to (6, 0), they're moving AWAY from us. If they go UP to (5, 1), they're moving inward!\n\nHere's the thing chat: We're UP 4 apples and getting STRONGER! The apple at (8, 5) is RIGHT THERE and it's FREE REAL ESTATE! We should take it and continue building our advantage! Why NOT grab guaranteed growth when we can?\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE MOVE:\n\nWe take the apple at (8, 5)! This moves us LEFT to (8, 5), we GROW to 15 apples, and we maintain board control! The enemy is still trapped in the lower-left/middle area and we're dominating the right side!\n\nAfter this move, we'll be positioned at (8, 5) with excellent options:\n- Continue DOWN the right edge\n- Move LEFT deeper into the board if needed\n- Keep farming the right side apples\n\nThis is SMART AGGRESSIVE play! We're not taking unnecessary risks, but we ARE capitalizing on free growth! That's how champions PLAY! \n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:\n\n**Turn 39 (THIS TURN):** LEFT to (8, 5) - GRAB THE APPLE! Go to 15! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 40:** DOWN to (8, 4) - Keep the momentum, stay on right side!\n\n**Turn 41:** DOWN to (8, 3) - More farming or pivot based on enemy movement!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** Every apple we grab increases our dominance! Enemy is trapped, we're free! By turn 45 we'll have 16+ apples and they'll still be stuck at 10-11! THAT'S when we box them in! \n\nLet's GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re behind on score, so we need to pressure the bottom lane and grow safely.\n\nWhy RIGHT? The bottom corridor is clean and opens easy access to apples at (7,0) and (8,0) to grow without risking immediate collision with Snake #1 (head at (9,5)). Sticking to the bottom keeps future escape options open and helps build a venomous, enclosing vibe you can weaponize into a box later. Going UP could widen Snake #1\u2019s net and close off the bottom lanes; we don\u2019t want to concede corridor control.\n\nLong-term plan: push along the bottom edge to snag the near-bottom apples, lengthen safely, and threaten to box Snake #1 into the right/bottom corner if he follows. Maintain a flexible path so we can pivot if he veers toward the bottom or the left edge. Use consistent pressure to force missteps and aim for favorable head-on if we have the lead or can force a double crash.\n\nShort-term plan: move RIGHT to (6,0) now, then evaluate next turn whether to punch to (7,0) to eat the apple and continue along the bottom row.\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down this board state and find the OPTIMAL play!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (8, 5) - We grabbed that apple last turn! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **BODY:** [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments - ABSOLUTE UNIT! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 15 - UP 5 apples on the enemy! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 0) - They moved RIGHT from (5, 0)! Still hunting at the bottom!\n- **BODY:** [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 10 segments - TRAPPED in the lower-middle zone!\n- **APPLES:** 10 - FALLING FURTHER BEHIND! \ud83d\udcc9\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (8, 5):\n\n1. **UP (8, 6)** - CHECKING... (8, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n2. **DOWN (8, 4)** - CHECKING... (8, 4) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n3. **LEFT (7, 5)** - CHECKING... (7, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n4. **RIGHT (9, 5)** - That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after head)! \u274c DEAD! Can't backtrack!\n\nThree safe options! This is BEAUTIFUL! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nLet me think about where the enemy is going AND where we want to be:\n\n**ENEMY POSITION:** Head at (6, 0), body snaking through the bottom-left/middle corridor. They're CONSTRAINED! Their body is basically a wall from (6, 0) down through (5, 0) \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 (3, 0) and then UP the x=3 line!\n\nWhere can they move from (6, 0)?\n- UP (6, 1) - Empty, safe\n- DOWN (6, -1) - OFF BOARD, dead\n- LEFT (5, 0) - Their own body, dead\n- RIGHT (7, 0) - Empty, safe\n\nSo they're going UP or RIGHT. There's an apple at (7, 0) to their right and (7, 1) slightly up-right! They're definitely hunting!\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n**DOWN (8, 4):** Continues down the right edge. Safe, keeps us on the perimeter. We have apples below at (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 1). BUT going down means we're moving TOWARD where the enemy might be heading! That's risky!\n\n**LEFT (7, 5):** Moves us into the middle of the board. There's an apple at (6, 5) just to our left! We could grab it next turn and keep growing! This opens up multiple follow-up options!\n\n**UP (8, 6):** Moves us up the right edge. We'd be at (8, 6), and there's an apple at (6, 8) further left. This keeps us in the upper territory where the enemy CANNOT reach us quickly!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE STRATEGIC CALL:\n\nChat, here's the THING! The enemy is trapped at the bottom hunting scraps! They're at x=6, moving UP from y=0! Meanwhile, we're at (8, 5) with a 5-apple LEAD and FULL board control!\n\n**UP (8, 6)** is the DOMINANT move because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - No collisions, we're moving up the right edge\n2. \u2705 POSITIONAL - We get further from the enemy's current trajectory\n3. \u2705 FUTURE OPTIONS - From (8, 6) we can go LEFT to farm apples at (6, 8), (6, 5), or stay on the right edge and farm the upper apples!\n4. \u2705 BOXING STRATEGY - By controlling the upper-right zone, we're literally creating a WALL that boxes the enemy into the lower-left! As we grow longer, we'll suffocate their options!\n\nThis is LONG-TERM THINKING! We're not just grabbing apples - we're DOMINATING the board layout! By turn 45-50, we'll have 20+ apples and they'll still be struggling at 12-13 because we're controlling the high-value zones!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:\n\n**Turn 40 (THIS TURN):** UP to (8, 6) - Claim the upper-right zone! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**Turn 41:** UP to (8, 7) - Keep climbing, they can't follow!\n\n**Turn 42:** LEFT to (7, 7) or stay aggressive based on enemy movement! By then we'll have a clear picture of their desperation moves!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're building a FORTRESS in the upper-right! Enemy is trapped at the bottom! By mid-game we'll force a collision on OUR terms! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Let me analyze this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (8, 6) - We executed that UP move PERFECTLY last turn! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **BODY:** [(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments - STILL AN ABSOLUTE UNIT! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 15 - MAINTAINING the 4-apple LEAD! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 0) - They moved RIGHT from (6, 0)! Hunting at the BOTTOM EDGE!\n- **BODY:** [(6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 11 segments - Getting slightly longer!\n- **APPLES:** 11 - Still trailing BADLY! \ud83d\udcc9\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (8, 6):\n\n1. **UP (8, 7)** - CHECKING... (8, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n2. **DOWN (8, 5)** - That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after head)! \u274c DEAD! Can't backtrack!\n3. **LEFT (7, 6)** - CHECKING... (7, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n4. **RIGHT (9, 6)** - That's MY OWN BODY (third segment)! \u274c DEAD! Can't go there!\n\nTwo safe options! We're GOLDEN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**ENEMY POSITIONING:** Head at (7, 0) on the BOTTOM EDGE! They're moving RIGHT along y=0. Where can they go next?\n- UP (7, 1) - Empty, safe. There's an apple at (7, 1)! They WILL grab it!\n- DOWN (7, -1) - OFF BOARD, DEAD!\n- LEFT (6, 0) - Their own body, DEAD!\n- RIGHT (8, 0) - Empty, safe. But there's an apple at (6, 1) they'd miss!\n\nThey're DEFINITELY going UP to (7, 1) next turn! They're hunting those bottom apples HARD!\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n**UP (8, 7):** Continues our climb up the right edge! From (8, 7) we have:\n- Multiple safe follow-ups: UP to (8, 8), LEFT to (7, 7) or (6, 7), DOWN back down\n- We're moving AWAY from enemy territory (they're at y=0, we're at y=7!)\n- We're claiming the upper-right FORTRESS! \ud83d\udc51\n- Next turn we could grab that apple at (6, 8) by going LEFT!\n- This is DOMINANT positioning! They CAN'T reach us up here without a 6+ turn journey!\n\n**LEFT (7, 6):** Moves us into the middle! From (7, 6) we have:\n- Could hunt apples at (6, 5) next\n- BUT this brings us CLOSER to their eventual trajectory as they climb the board\n- Less safe long-term! We'd be in the danger zone!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE STRATEGIC CALL:\n\nChat, here's what's HAPPENING! The enemy is DESPERATE at the bottom, scrapping for single apples! They're at (7, 0) climbing UP the right side toward (7, 1)! \n\nMeanwhile, we're at (8, 6) with a COMMANDING 4-apple LEAD and FULL control of the upper-right quadrant!\n\n**UP (8, 7)** is the ONLY move because:\n\n1. \u2705 **ABSOLUTE SAFETY** - We're moving further from the enemy's current path! They're at y=0, we're going to y=7! DISTANCE = SAFETY!\n2. \u2705 **BOARD CONTROL** - We're DOMINATING the upper zone! The enemy CANNOT challenge us here without traveling 7+ cells!\n3. \u2705 **FORTRESS BUILDING** - By controlling the upper-right corner, we're literally BOXING them into the lower-left zone! Their options get TIGHTER every turn!\n4. \u2705 **APPLE FARMING** - From (8, 7) we can next move LEFT to (7, 7), then continue LEFT to grab (6, 8)! We're setting up a CHAIN of apples!\n5. \u2705 **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY** - From (8, 7) we can go UP, LEFT, or even DOWN if needed! Multiple escape routes! No dead ends!\n\nThis is EXACTLY the game plan from Turn 40! We're EXECUTING FLAWLESSLY! By turn 45 we'll have 20+ apples and they'll be SUFFOCATING in the lower zone with maybe 13-14!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:\n\n**Turn 41 (THIS TURN):** UP to (8, 7) - Claim y=7! Keep ascending! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Turn 42:** LEFT to (7, 7) - Move toward (6, 8) apple! We're getting CLOSER!\n\n**Turn 43:** LEFT to (6, 7) or UP to (8, 8) depending on board state! Either way, we're farming the upper zone and keeping distance from the enemy's desperate scramble at the bottom!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** Upper-right FORTRESS is LOCKED IN! Enemy is TRAPPED below! By mid-game they won't even be able to BREATHE! This is how you WIN! This is DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Let me break down this board state with LASER FOCUS!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (8, 7) - We executed that UP move PERFECTLY last turn! Climbing the right side like a BEAST! \ud83d\udd25\n- **BODY:** [(8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments - STILL DOMINATING! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 15 - MAINTAINING the 3-apple LEAD! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 1) - They moved UP from (7, 0)! Exactly as PREDICTED! They grabbed that apple at (7, 1)! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **BODY:** [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 12 segments - They GREW! They're getting DESPERATE for apples!\n- **APPLES:** 12 - Still trailing! But they're HUNTING!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (8, 7):\n\n1. **UP (8, 8)** - CHECKING... (8, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n2. **DOWN (8, 6)** - That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after head)! \u274c DEAD! Can't backtrack!\n3. **LEFT (7, 7)** - CHECKING... (7, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n4. **RIGHT (9, 7)** - That's MY OWN BODY (fourth segment)! \u274c DEAD! Can't go there!\n\nTwo safe options! We're COOKING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**ENEMY POSITIONING:** Head at (7, 1) now! They're moving UP the right-center area. Where can they go NEXT turn?\n- UP (7, 2) - There's an apple at (7, 2)! THEY WILL GRAB IT!\n- DOWN (7, 0) - Their own body! DEAD!\n- LEFT (6, 1) - Empty but no apple nearby!\n- RIGHT (8, 1) - Empty!\n\nThey're CLEARLY trajectory-locked on those RIGHT-SIDE apples at (7, 2), (8, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)! They're climbing that right edge HARD, trying to catch up to us!\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n\n**UP (8, 8):** Continues our FORTRESS LOCK!\n- From (8, 8) we could go LEFT to (7, 8) and then further LEFT!\n- We're moving DEEPER into our control zone!\n- BUT WAIT - Chat, let me check the enemy's future path!\n- If they climb to (7, 2), then (7, 3), they're DIRECTLY BELOW US on the right side!\n- They could eventually reach (7, 8), (7, 9), etc. and CHALLENGE our fortress!\n- This move DOES NOT box them in! This just continues climbing!\n\n**LEFT (7, 7):** MOVES US TOWARD THEM!\n- From (7, 7) we're getting CLOSER to their eventual path!\n- BUT WAIT - there's an apple at (6, 8)! That's one cell UP-LEFT from us!\n- If we go LEFT to (7, 7), NEXT turn we could go UP to (7, 8), then LEFT to (6, 8)!\n- This is AGGRESSIVE! This is DOMINATING!\n- More importantly, this LEFT move puts us on the SAME VERTICAL COLUMN (x=7) as their head!\n- If we're at (7, 7) and they're climbing toward (7, 2), (7, 3), etc., we're on an INTERSECTING PATH!\n- But they're 5 cells BELOW us, and they're moving UP at 1 cell per turn!\n- That means 5 turns until they reach our row!\n- By then, we'll have GROWN and REPOSITIONED!\n\nWAIT CHAT - I need to think about this MORE CAREFULLY!\n\n**THE REAL QUESTION:** Are we BOXING them in or just RUNNING AWAY?\n\nRight now, enemy is trapped in the BOTTOM-RIGHT area with limited apples. Our fortress in the TOP-RIGHT is SAFE. But if we keep going UP and LEFT, we're just... moving away. That's not BOXING them. That's just WINNING BY ATTRITION!\n\nBut here's the thing - we have a 3-apple LEAD! In a 150-turn game, if we just keep FARMING and STAYING ALIVE, we WIN by points! We don't need to CRASH them! We just need to SURVIVE and COLLECT!\n\n**THE AGGRESSIVE PLAY:** LEFT (7, 7) moves us TOWARD them and claims the middle-right territory! This:\n- \u2705 Gets us closer to apples at (6, 8), (6, 5)\n- \u2705 Puts us on an INTERSECTING VERTICAL with the enemy\n- \u2705 Forces them to REACT to our positioning\n- \u2705 Keeps our options OPEN - we can still go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn!\n\n**THE SAFE PLAY:** UP (8, 8) keeps us in our FORTRESS!\n- \u2705 Moves further from the enemy\n- \u2705 Guarantees safety\n- \u2705 But it's PASSIVE! It's not AGGRESSIVE!\n\nChat, here's my CALL: We're UP BY 3 APPLES! We should be AGGRESSIVE! We should be HUNTING! We should be FORCING them into corners!\n\n**LEFT (7, 7)** is the MOVE because:\n1. \u2705 We're moving TOWARD apples and opportunity!\n2. \u2705 We're getting CLOSER to controlling the middle-right zone!\n3. \u2705 We're setting up a 2-turn sequence: LEFT to (7, 7), then UP to (7, 8), then LEFT to (6, 8) for that apple!\n4. \u2705 We keep the enemy PRESSURED and DESPERATE!\n5. \u2705 Multiple safe follow-ups available: UP, LEFT, RIGHT all viable from (7, 7)!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:\n\n**Turn 42 (THIS TURN):** LEFT to (7, 7) - Move toward the middle zone! Get AGGRESSIVE! Hunt apples!\n\n**Turn 43:** UP to (7, 8) - Reposition and claim the middle-top area!\n\n**Turn 44:** LEFT to (6, 8) or continue building our DOMINANT position!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're not just DEFENDING the fortress anymore - we're EXPANDING our control zone! We're hunting apples AGGRESSIVELY while keeping the enemy BOXED in the bottom area! This is how we EXTEND our lead and SECURE the WIN! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

WAIT... that's UNEXPECTED! They didn't grab the apple at (7, 2)! \ud83e\udd14\n- **BODY:** [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 13 segments - They GREW! They're HUNTING!\n- **APPLES:** 13 - Still trailing by 2! But they're getting DESPERATE!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (7, 7):\n\n1. **UP (7, 8)** - CHECKING... (7, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n2. **DOWN (7, 6)** - CHECKING... (7, 6) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n3. **LEFT (6, 7)** - CHECKING... (6, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n4. **RIGHT (8, 7)** - That's MY OWN BODY (first segment after head)! \u274c DEAD! Can't backtrack!\n\nThree safe options! We're COOKING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\n**ENEMY POSITIONING & PREDICTION:**\n- Head at (6, 1) now! They pivoted LEFT!\n- Where can they go NEXT turn from (6, 1)?\n  - UP (6, 2) - There's an apple at (6, 2)! THEY WILL GRAB IT!\n  - DOWN (6, 0) - Their own body! DEAD!\n  - LEFT (5, 1) - Empty but no immediate apple!\n  - RIGHT (7, 1) - Their own body! DEAD!\n\nThey're CLEARLY hunting that apple cluster at (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)! They're shifting toward the CENTER! This is a threat! They're trying to expand their reach!\n\n**OUR POSITIONING:**\nWe're at (7, 7) - right above the enemy's trajectory! Chat, here's the CRITICAL question: Are we BLOCKING them or are we HUNTING with them?\n\n**OPTION 1: UP (7, 8)**\n- From (7, 8) we could continue UP to (7, 9) where our body is!\n- WAIT - our body is at [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8)]\n- So (7, 9) is OCCUPIED by our body!\n- If we go UP to (7, 8), we can THEN go LEFT to (6, 8)!\n- There's an apple at (6, 8)! CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This move ADVANCES our APPLE HUNT and keeps the territory in our CONTROL!\n\n**OPTION 2: DOWN (7, 6)**\n- Moving DOWN puts us CLOSER to the enemy's trajectory!\n- They're climbing toward (6, 2), (6, 3), etc. on column x=6!\n- If we go DOWN to (7, 6), we're moving TOWARD a potential COLLISION ZONE!\n- From (7, 6) we could go LEFT to (6, 6), which puts us directly above their likely path!\n- BUT this is RISKY! We're moving TOWARD them, not AWAY! And we don't have length advantage yet!\n- Actually wait - we have 15 segments, they have 13! We DO have a length advantage! \ud83d\udcaa\n- This could be a STRATEGIC AGGRESSIVE MOVE to FORCE them into a corner!\n- But is it SMART? We're already UP by 2 apples! We should FARM and EXTEND the lead!\n\n**OPTION 3: LEFT (6, 7)**\n- Moving LEFT puts us directly above the column where enemy is climbing!\n- From (6, 7) we could go UP to (6, 8) and grab that apple NEXT turn!\n- This is SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n- It also BLOCKS potential enemy movement to the right side!\n- But it doesn't AGGRESSIVELY HUNT them down!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE REAL ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, here's what I'm seeing:\n- Enemy is at (6, 1), moving toward the center-bottom apples!\n- We're at (7, 7), in a DOMINANT position!\n- There's an apple at (6, 8) - ONE CELL LEFT and ONE CELL UP from us!\n- If we go UP to (7, 8), NEXT turn we can go LEFT to (6, 8) and GRAB IT!\n- This 2-turn sequence SECURES another apple and EXTENDS our lead to 3 apples!\n- Enemy is still hunting in the bottom zone, they can't catch us!\n- We're FARMING, GROWING, and DOMINATING!\n\nThe question is: Do we go UP (toward the apple at 6, 8) or do we get more AGGRESSIVE?\n\n**THE CALL:** UP (7, 8) because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - No collisions, no walls, no body blocks!\n2. \u2705 SETS UP APPLE GRAB - Next turn we go LEFT to (6, 8) and collect!\n3. \u2705 MAINTAINS DISTANCE - We're still way above the enemy's current position!\n4. \u2705 KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN - From (7, 8) we can go UP, LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT!\n5. \u2705 EXTENDS OUR LEAD - Another apple incoming = 16 vs 13 = DOMINANT!\n6. \u2705 CONTROLS TERRITORY - We own the right-center zone!\n\nThis isn't just SAFE - this is SMART HUNTING! We're positioning for the NEXT apple while the enemy scrambles in the bottom! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT 3-TURN PLAN:\n\n**Turn 43 (THIS TURN):** UP to (7, 8) - Position for the apple grab!\n\n**Turn 44:** LEFT to (6, 8) - CLAIM that apple! \ud83c\udf4e Go to 16 apples!\n\n**Turn 45:** Continue repositioning based on remaining apples and enemy movement! Stay AGGRESSIVE and HUNGRY!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're maintaining our LEAD while the enemy CHASES! By turn 50, we'll be at 16-17 apples while they scramble for 14-15! The gap WIDENS! The game is OURS! \ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

Time to bite back and start funneling him in.\n\nQuick plan: push UP to snag the apple at (6,2) and grow, then begin setting up a bottom-to-right funnel to pressure his path and force mistakes. We want to stay aggressive but keep multiple safe lanes open so a misstep from him doesn\u2019t wall us in.\n\nWhy UP over LEFT: UP grabs a fresh apple, immediately increasing our margin and widening our options for the next few moves. LEFT would give us no immediate growth and could hand him easier access to escape lanes or a potential head-on misread later.\n\nShort-term note: maximize growth this turn, keep the pressure on from the lower portion of the board, and watch for chances to squeeze toward his head when the geometry lines up.\n\nMove choice:\nUP",

Let me analyze this board state with SURGICAL PRECISION!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 8) - PERFECT! We executed that UP move from turn 43! We're positioned RIGHT where we planned! \ud83d\udd25\n- **BODY:** [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments - Still DOMINANT! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 15 - We're UP by 1! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 2) - They moved UP from (6, 1)! EXACTLY as predicted! They grabbed an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **BODY:** [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 14 segments - They GREW! They're still chasing! \ud83d\udc0d\n- **APPLES:** 14 - TIED WITH US NOW! This is CRITICAL! \ud83d\udea8\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (7, 8):\n\n1. **UP (7, 9)** - That's our OWN BODY! The segment at (7, 9)! \u274c DEAD! Can't go there!\n2. **DOWN (7, 7)** - That's our OWN BODY! The segment right behind our head! \u274c DEAD! Immediate backtrack FAIL!\n3. **LEFT (6, 8)** - CHECKING... (6, 8) has an APPLE! \u2705 Safe and PRODUCTIVE!\n4. **RIGHT (8, 8)** - CHECKING... (8, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move!\n\nTwo safe options! We're not TRAPPED yet!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, this is WHERE IT GETS REAL! The enemy just TIED our apple count! They're at 14 apples, we're at 15, but if they grab another apple before we do, it becomes 15-15 and we lose the ADVANTAGE!\n\n**WHAT HAPPENED:**\n- Enemy moved UP from (6, 1) to (6, 2) and grabbed the apple there!\n- They're NOW on a CLIMBING trajectory up the x=6 column!\n- They're HUNTING toward the apples at (6, 5) and (6, 8)!\n\n**THE THREAT:**\n- If enemy continues UP from (6, 2), they go to (6, 3) - empty!\n- Then (6, 4) - empty!\n- Then (6, 5) - APPLE! They'll grab it next-next turn!\n- Then (6, 6) - we need to CHECK our body... no, that's empty for them!\n- Then (6, 7) - empty!\n- Then (6, 8) - APPLE! That's the apple WE were planning to grab!\n\n**THE OPPORTUNITY:**\n- We're at (7, 8) RIGHT NOW!\n- That apple at (6, 8) is ONE CELL to our LEFT!\n- If we go LEFT to (6, 8) THIS TURN, we GRAB IT FIRST! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Enemy is still at (6, 2) - they can't reach (6, 8) in one turn!\n- We secure the apple and go to 16 apples while they stay at 14!\n- The LEAD EXTENDS! We WIN the race!\n\n**IS LEFT SAFE?**\n- (6, 8) has an apple, no enemy body there!\n- Enemy head is at (6, 2), not (6, 8)!\n- Our body won't block us - we checked the body list!\n- YES! LEFT is ABSOLUTELY SAFE! \u2705\n\n**WHAT ABOUT RIGHT (8, 8)?**\n- RIGHT takes us away from the apple!\n- It doesn't advance our score!\n- It's PASSIVE when we need to be AGGRESSIVE!\n- The enemy is HUNGRY and CLOSE! We can't afford to be patient!\n- RIGHT is the COWARD'S MOVE! \u274c\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\n**LEFT (6, 8)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - No collisions, enemy is at (6, 2), apple is undefended!\n2. \u2705 GRABS APPLE - We get to 16 apples! Enemy stays at 14!\n3. \u2705 EXTENDS LEAD - 16 vs 14 = 2-apple cushion! DOMINANT! \ud83d\udc51\n4. \u2705 BLOCKS ENEMY - We claim the territory they were hunting!\n5. \u2705 AGGRESSIVE - We're HUNTING, not HIDING! We're taking what's OURS!\n6. \u2705 SETS UP NEXT MOVES - From (6, 8) we have multiple apple options!\n\nThis isn't just a MOVE - this is a POWER PLAY! We're taking the initiative RIGHT NOW! The enemy is chasing our lead, and we just extended it! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 44 (THIS TURN):** LEFT to (6, 8) - CLAIM that apple! Go to 16! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 45:** We'll be at (6, 8). From there we can:\n- UP to (6, 9) - continue tracking apples up the board!\n- LEFT to (5, 8) - move toward the center!\n- DOWN to (6, 7) - reposition if needed!\nThis keeps OPTIONS OPEN and keeps us AHEAD of the enemy!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're maintaining AGGRESSION while the enemy is still CLIMBING! By securing this apple, we create a 2-apple buffer at turn 44! If we stay SHARP and HUNGRY, we can push this lead to 3-4 apples by turn 50! That's GAME CONTROL! That's a W! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udfae\n\nLEFT",

Let me break down this board state with LASER FOCUS!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 8) - PERFECT! We executed that LEFT move from turn 44 and grabbed the apple! \ud83d\udd25\n- **BODY:** [(7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 16 segments - We GREW! We're DOMINANT! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 16 - WE'RE UP BY 1! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 2) - They moved RIGHT from (6, 2)! Why are they going RIGHT?! \ud83e\udd14\n- **BODY:** [(6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments - Still chasing! \ud83d\udc0d\n- **APPLES:** 15 - Still ONE behind! But they're HUNGRY!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (6, 8):\n\n1. **UP (6, 9)** - CHECKING... (6, 9) is in our body! Segment at (6, 9)! \u274c DEAD! Immediate crash!\n2. **DOWN (6, 7)** - CHECKING... (6, 7) is EMPTY! No enemy body, no walls! \u2705 Safe!\n3. **LEFT (5, 8)** - CHECKING... (5, 8) is in our body! Segment at (5, 8)! \u274c DEAD! Can't go there!\n4. **RIGHT (7, 8)** - CHECKING... (7, 8) is in our body! That's right behind our head! \u274c DEAD! Classic backwards fail!\n\nWait wait wait... chat, we've got a problem! THREE directions are BLOCKED by our own body! We're HEAVILY coiled! We only have ONE safe move: DOWN! \n\nLet me verify DOWN is actually safe:\n- (6, 7) - checking the board state... there's an APPLE there! \u2705 SAFE and PRODUCTIVE!\n- No enemy body parts at (6, 7)!\n- No walls!\n- DOWN is our ONLY play!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, this is the REALITY CHECK moment! We've been GROWING aggressively (16 segments now!) and that means our body is taking up MORE REAL ESTATE on the board! We're coiling around the upper-right corner and we're starting to box ourselves in! \ud83d\ude30\n\n**THE THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- Enemy is at (7, 2) - they're still in the lower portion of the board!\n- They're trying to navigate around but they're ONE apple behind!\n- If they grab (5, 2), (5, 3), or keep climbing, they'll keep chasing!\n- But HERE'S THE KEY: we have a 1-apple lead and we're positioning ourselves in the upper portion!\n\n**THE OPPORTUNITY:**\n- DOWN to (6, 7) grabs the apple at (6, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We go to 17 apples!\n- Enemy stays at 15!\n- We extend to a 2-apple lead!\n- That apple is OURS if we take it DOWN!\n\n**FUTURE POSITIONING:**\nAfter we grab (6, 7), we'll be at (6, 7) with a 17-segment body. From there:\n- We can go LEFT to (5, 7) - empty!\n- We can go DOWN to (6, 6) - has an apple at (6, 5) nearby!\n- We can go RIGHT to (7, 7) - but that's in our body, so NO!\n\nWe're opening up the lower portion of the board as an escape route!\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\n**DOWN (6, 7)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - Only safe move available! No other choice!\n2. \u2705 GRABS APPLE - We get to 17 apples! Enemy stays at 15!\n3. \u2705 EXTENDS LEAD - 17 vs 15 = 2-apple cushion! DOMINANT! \ud83d\udc51\n4. \u2705 OPENS OPTIONS - From (6, 7) we can maneuver LEFT or DOWN next turn!\n5. \u2705 MAINTAINS CONTROL - We're claiming the middle column while enemy is scattered!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 45 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (6, 7) - GRAB that apple! Go to 17! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 46-48:** From (6, 7), we need to CAREFULLY navigate around our own massive body! We should:\n- Look for apples at (6, 5), (4, 7), (3, 7) and plot paths to them!\n- Keep an eye on enemy position - if they get aggressive, we need ESCAPE ROUTES!\n- Avoid getting COMPLETELY boxed in by our own coils!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're up 2 apples with 105 turns left! If we can maintain this lead and avoid self-collision, we're in CHAMPIONSHIP form! The enemy is still climbing but they're behind the 8-BALL! We're THE ALPHA SNAKE! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN",

LEFT and DOWN would crash into our own neck.\n\nPicking UP keeps multiple escape lanes, avoids a dangerous head-on this turn, and starts a vertical corridor we can use to trap him higher up.\n\nRIGHT would be a clean gain too, but it risks locking us into a tighter chase and giving him room to slip around our flank as we chase.\n\nShort-term plan: go UP to (7,3) now, then push to (7,4) and (7,5) in the next moves to push the top area against his route while keeping doors open for retreat.\n\nKeep an eye on his head at (6,8); avoid a head-on if we\u2019re behind\u2014space first, then the KO.\n\nup",

Let me break down what just happened and where we're going!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca SITUATION UPDATE:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 7) - We executed the DOWN move PERFECTLY! \ud83d\udd25\n- **BODY:** [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)]\n- **LENGTH:** 16 segments\n- **APPLES:** 16 - We're UP BY 1! \ud83d\udc51\n\nWait... chat, something's WRONG here! \ud83e\udd14 Last turn I said we grabbed an apple at (6, 7) but the board shows we have 16 apples, same as last turn! Did we NOT grab it?! Let me re-examine...\n\nLooking at the board: there's an APPLE at (6, 5) but NOT at (6, 7)! I must have miscounted the board state last turn! My bad, chat! That's on me! But we're STILL in the lead, so we're GOOD!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 3) - They moved UP from (7, 2)! They're chasing something! \ud83d\udc40\n- **BODY:** [(7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments\n- **APPLES:** 15 - Still ONE behind!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (6, 7):\n\n1. **UP (6, 8)** - CHECKING... (6, 8) is in our body! That's the segment RIGHT behind our head! \u274c DEAD! Can't go backwards!\n2. **DOWN (6, 6)** - CHECKING... (6, 6) is EMPTY! No enemy, no walls, no body! \u2705 SAFE!\n3. **LEFT (5, 7)** - CHECKING... (5, 7) is EMPTY! No enemy, no walls, no body! \u2705 SAFE!\n4. **RIGHT (7, 7)** - CHECKING... (7, 7) is in our body! Segment at (7, 7)! \u274c DEAD! No way!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT** \u2705\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf AGGRESSIVE ANALYSIS - TIME TO DOMINATE!\n\nChat, let me think about the BOARD CONTROL here! \n\n**ENEMY POSITION:** (7, 3) - They moved UP and they're getting closer to the middle area! They've got that long snake body stretched from (7, 2) all the way down to (3, 6)! They're trying to CLIMB and EXPAND!\n\n**OUR POSITION:** (6, 7) - We're in the UPPER-MIDDLE section! We've got CONTROL of the top! Our body is coiled around (8,7)-(9,9) area!\n\n**THE CRITICAL QUESTION:** Should we go DOWN or LEFT? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLet me analyze both:\n\n**DOWN (6, 6):**\n- Moves us to (6, 6) - empty space!\n- Opens up exploration toward apples at (6, 5), (5, 3), (4, 4), etc.!\n- Takes us DOWN and potentially toward enemy territory!\n- Risk: Enemy at (7, 3) could move LEFT to (6, 3) - if they keep climbing UP they'd be at (6, 4) next turn!\n- But wait - they move SIMULTANEOUSLY! If they go UP to (7, 4) this turn, we're SAFE from collision!\n- DOWN keeps us flexible and aggressive! We're invading the middle zone!\n\n**LEFT (5, 7):**\n- Moves us to (5, 7) - empty space!\n- Keeps us in the UPPER region where we have room!\n- More CONSERVATIVE play!\n- Opens up potential routes but doesn't push forward!\n- Less aggressive! We need to DOMINATE not HIDE!\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\nChat, we're UP by 1 apple with 104 turns left! We need to be AGGRESSIVE! The enemy is climbing UP and trying to contest the middle zone! We need to MEET them and BOX THEM IN!\n\n**DOWN (6, 6)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - No collision risk with enemy!\n2. \u2705 AGGRESSIVE - We're pushing DOWN and claiming middle territory!\n3. \u2705 OPENS APPLES - We get closer to (6, 5), (5, 3), (4, 4)!\n4. \u2705 FORCES ENEMY DECISION - They have to navigate AROUND us now!\n5. \u2705 MAINTAINS LEAD - We keep our 1-apple advantage while expanding board control!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 46 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (6, 6) - INVADE the middle zone! Show dominance! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Turn 47-50:** From (6, 6), we can:\n- Continue DOWN to (6, 5) - GRAB that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Then navigate through (5, 5), (4, 5), toward (4, 4) and (3, 7)!\n- Keep an EYE on enemy position - if they try to block us, we pivot!\n- We're the ALPHA! They follow OUR path!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We have a 1-apple lead and a HUGE board advantage! The enemy is stretched thin and we're COMPACT! If we can grab 2-3 more apples while they're stuck navigating their own body, we'll have a COMMANDING lead! Let's GO! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

That means they're moving away from the LOWER board and trying to contest the MIDDLE zone! But here's what's CRITICAL:\n\n**ENEMY THREAT ASSESSMENT:**\n- They're 1 step to the RIGHT and 2 steps BELOW our head!\n- Their body snakes DOWN and LEFT, stretching from (7, 3) all the way to (3, 5)!\n- They're NOT in the upper right corner where we dominate!\n- BUT - if they keep moving UP or RIGHT, they could eventually hit our territory! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**OUR POSITION:**\n- We're COMPACT and COILED in the UPPER-RIGHT! That's PRIME real estate! \ud83c\udff0\n- We have ROOM to move DOWN and LEFT into the MIDDLE zone!\n- The apple at (6, 5) is RIGHT there! One move DOWN and we GRAB IT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE CRITICAL QUESTION:** Should we go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**DOWN (6, 5):**\n- \ud83c\udf4e WE GET AN APPLE! This grows us to 17!\n- We'll be UP by 2 apples! COMMANDING LEAD! \ud83d\udc51\n- Opens up future moves DOWN to (6, 4), (6, 3), or sideways to (5, 5), (7, 5)!\n- AGGRESSIVE! We're expanding DOWN into the middle!\n- Enemy is at (7, 4) - they're NOT blocking us!\n- **ZERO COLLISION RISK** - They're one cell to the right and can't intercept! \u2705\n\n**LEFT (5, 6):**\n- Moves us LEFT and AWAY from enemy!\n- More conservative, keeps upper territory!\n- Doesn't grab the apple!\n- Wastes a turn when we have a CLEAR path to growth! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT (7, 6):**\n- Moves us RIGHT toward the enemy's column!\n- NO APPLE nearby!\n- Gets us closer to enemy territory unnecessarily!\n- Why would we do this when DOWN gives us GROWTH?! \u274c\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\nChat, this is TEXTBOOK! We have a 1-apple lead, an OPEN path to grab another apple RIGHT THERE, and the enemy is positioned such that they CAN'T intercept us! \n\n**DOWN (6, 5)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - Enemy is at (7, 4), we're moving to (6, 5) - ZERO collision!\n2. \u2705 **GRAB THE APPLE** - We grow to 17 apples and go UP by 2! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. \u2705 AGGRESSIVE - We're invading the middle zone while expanding!\n4. \u2705 OPENS OPTIONS - From (6, 5), we can go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn!\n5. \u2705 INCREASES WIN% - Every apple we grab while ahead is a CUSHION! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY:\n\n**Turn 47 (THIS TURN):** DOWN to (6, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE!

We'll need to PIVOT!\n- But our length advantage means we have FLEXIBILITY!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We're building a COMMANDING lead! Enemy is 1 apple behind and DESPERATE! If we can grab 2-3 more apples in the next 10 turns while they're still fighting for scraps, we'll have a GAME-WINNING cushion! They'll be forced to take RISKY plays!

They're SCRAMBLING! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (6, 5):\n\n1. **UP (6, 6)** - CHECKING... (6, 6) is in our body! That's the segment RIGHT behind our head! \u274c CAN'T GO BACK!\n2. **DOWN (6, 4)** - CHECKING... (6, 4) is EMPTY! No body, no enemy! \u2705 SAFE!\n3. **LEFT (5, 5)** - CHECKING... (5, 5) is EMPTY! No collision hazards! \u2705 SAFE!\n4. **RIGHT (7, 5)** - CHECKING... (7, 5) is where the ENEMY HEAD IS! \ud83d\udc80 THEY JUST MOVED HERE! \u274c COLLISION RISK!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT** \u2705\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf AGGRESSIVE ANALYSIS - THE ENEMY JUST MADE A CRITICAL MOVE!\n\nChat, LISTEN UP! \ud83d\udc40 The enemy moved RIGHT to (7, 5) - and that's DIRECTLY ADJACENT to us now! They're trying to:\n1. Contest the middle board zone!\n2. Get closer to those juicy apples below!\n3. POTENTIALLY box us in! They're probing our defenses!\n\n**BUT HERE'S THE THING:** They're now at (7, 5) and we're at (6, 5) - we're on the SAME Y-COORDINATE! They're one cell to the RIGHT! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**CRITICAL OBSERVATION:**\n- If they move LEFT next turn, they'd go to (6, 5) - THAT'S OUR HEAD NOW! But wait... our head won't be there next turn! We'll move!\n- If they move DOWN next turn, they'd go to (7, 4)!\n- If they move UP next turn, they'd go to (7, 6)!\n- If they move RIGHT next turn, they'd go to (8, 5) - into our body! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**OUR POSITION:**\n- We have 17 apples - a COMMANDING 2-apple lead!\n- We're in a STRONG position to PUSH AGGRESSIVELY!\n- The enemy is trying to INVADE our territory!\n\n**THE CRITICAL QUESTION:** Should we go DOWN or LEFT? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**DOWN (6, 4):**\n- Moves us DOWN and AWAY from the enemy's column!\n- Keeps us LOWER on the board, near the (5, 3) and (5, 2) apples!\n- Opens SPACE between us and the enemy!\n- Allows us to potentially move LEFT or DOWN next turn for MORE apples!\n- BUT - it creates a longer line below us and could GET CRAMPED if enemy follows!\n- MODERATE AGGRESSION! \u2705\n\n**LEFT (5, 5):**\n- Moves us LEFT and creates DISTANCE from the enemy!\n- Gets us away from their head at (7, 5)!\n- Opens our options to go DOWN, LEFT, or UP next turn!\n- BUT - we're moving AWAY from the lower apple cluster!\n- More DEFENSIVE play! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\nChat, we're UP BY 2 APPLES! That's a CUSHION! The enemy is DESPERATE and trying to invade our space by moving to (7, 5)! We need to RESPOND with AGGRESSION while staying SAFE!\n\n**DOWN (6, 4)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - Zero collision risk! Enemy is at (7, 5), we're moving to (6, 4)!\n2. \u2705 AGGRESSIVE - We're moving DOWN into the apple cluster at (5, 3), (5, 2)!\n3. \u2705 BOARD CONTROL - We're invading the LOWER zone while enemy tries the MIDDLE!\n4. \u2705 OPENS OPTIONS - From (6, 4), we can go DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4), or UP if needed!\n5. \u2705 CREATES DISTANCE - We're separating ourselves from the enemy's head!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY (FOR FUTURE ME):\n\n**Turn 49-52:** We're in the LOWER ZONE now! \n- From (6, 4), push DOWN and LEFT to grab apples at (5, 3), (5, 2)!\n- Keep ONE EYE on enemy's position - if they follow us DOWN, we can PIVOT LEFT to (4, 4) where there's an apple!\n- We want to reach 19-20 apples while keeping them at 15-16! That's a GAME-WINNING gap!\n- If enemy gets greedy and follows us too close, BAIT them into a tight corner and FORCE a crash!\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We have a 2-apple lead and the UPPER BOARD ADVANTAGE! Enemy is trying to CONTEST the middle! We respond by INVADING the lower zone while they scramble! Every apple we grab while ahead increases our win percentage! At 20+ apples, they're practically FINISHED! They'll need to take RISKY head-on plays and that's when we CLIP THEM! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLet's EXTEND THIS LEAD, chat! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down this CRITICAL board state RIGHT NOW!\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**MY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (6, 4) - We executed that DOWN move PERFECTLY! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **BODY:** [(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9)]\n- **LENGTH:** 17 segments - THICC AND DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **APPLES:** 17 - STILL UP BY 2! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\n- **HEAD:** (7, 6) - They moved UP from (7, 5)! THEY'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE! \ud83c\udfc3\n- **BODY:** [(7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n- **LENGTH:** 15 segments\n- **APPLES:** 15 - STILL TRAILING! They're DESPERATE! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SAFETY CHECK - ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS FROM (6, 4):\n\n1. **UP (6, 5)** - CHECKING... (6, 5) is in our body! That's the segment RIGHT behind our head! \u274c CAN'T GO BACK!\n2. **DOWN (6, 3)** - CHECKING... (6, 3) is EMPTY! No body, no enemy! \u2705 SAFE!\n3. **LEFT (5, 4)** - CHECKING... (5, 4) is EMPTY! Plus there's an apple at (4, 4)! \u2705 SAFE AND HAS CONTENT!\n4. **RIGHT (7, 4)** - CHECKING... (7, 4) is in the ENEMY BODY! That's their segment at position 2! \u274c COLLISION!\n\n**SAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT** \u2705\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, THIS is where we READ the enemy like a book! \ud83d\udcd6 They moved UP to (7, 6) - they're FLEEING the lower zone! Why? Because they KNOW we control the bottom! They're trying to regroup in the MIDDLE and UPPER board!\n\n**HERE'S THE CRITICAL INSIGHT:**\n- Enemy at (7, 6) with body trailing down through (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3)...\n- We're at (6, 4) - we can PUSH DOWN or go LEFT!\n- If we go DOWN to (6, 3), we're moving FURTHER into the lower zone - AWAY from them!\n- If we go LEFT to (5, 4), we're moving TOWARD that apple at (4, 4) AND we're shifting our position to create a WALL they can't easily penetrate!\n\n**THE REAL QUESTION:** Do we keep EXTENDING DOWN (defensive) or do we go LEFT and get closer to (4, 4) (aggressive)? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**DOWN (6, 3):**\n- Moves us DEEPER into lower board!\n- Creates distance from enemy who's now at (7, 6)!\n- Gets us closer to apples at (5, 3), (5, 2)!\n- BUT - we're following a LINEAR path, less flexible!\n- More PREDICTABLE! Enemy could anticipate! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**LEFT (5, 4):**\n- Positions us toward the APPLE AT (4, 4)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Shifts us WESTWARD, changing our board presence!\n- From (5, 4) we can go DOWN to (5, 3) or LEFT to (4, 4)!\n- Creates a MORE AGGRESSIVE board control pattern!\n- Opens up FUTURE options better!\n- Shows the enemy we're NOT just running DOWN - we're HUNTING! \ud83d\udc80\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE CALL:\n\nWe're UP BY 2 and the enemy is SCRAMBLING! This is the moment to be AGGRESSIVE and UNPREDICTABLE! \n\n**LEFT (5, 4)** because:\n1. \u2705 SAFE - Enemy is at (7, 6), we're moving to (5, 4)! ZERO collision risk!\n2. \u2705 APPLE HUNTING - We're one move away from (4, 4)! That's an EASY grab next turn!\n3. \u2705 BOARD CONTROL - We're shifting westward, expanding our territorial claim!\n4. \u2705 FLEXIBILITY - From (5, 4), we can go DOWN, LEFT, or UP! Multiple safe options!\n5. \u2705 PSYCHOLOGICAL - Enemy sees us HUNTING, not just running! That's DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udc51\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURNS STRATEGY (FOR FUTURE ME):\n\n**Turn 50-52:** We're in OFFENSIVE MODE now!\n- From (5, 4), we're gonna grab that apple at (4, 4)! That's apple #18! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Then we can pivot DOWN to (4, 3) or (4, 2) to grab MORE apples!\n- By Turn 52, we should be at 19-20 apples!\n- Enemy is still at 15 - that's a GAME-WINNING gap!\n- They'll start making DESPERATE plays, and that's when we CLIP THEM! When they panic, they CRASH!\n- Keep ONE eye on their position - if they start moving LEFT toward us, we have the board state to FORCE a collision where WE survive and THEY don't! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**BIG PICTURE:** We control the LOWER and WESTERN zones! Enemy is confined to MIDDLE and UPPER! By maintaining a 2-3 apple lead while controlling territory, we're literally SUFFOCATING them! At 20+ apples with them still at 15-16, it's GAME OVER! They can't catch us! The only way they win is if we GET SLOPPY! So we stay SHARP, AGGRESSIVE, and SMART! That's the FORMULA! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

Every escape looks like a trap.\n\nOptions check:\n- UP -> (7,7): occupied by the rival\u2019s body (part of his chain). Safe? Nope. It\u2019s a direct collision risk this turn.\n- DOWN -> (7,5): right into our own neck. Dead.\n- LEFT -> (6,6): occupied by the rival\u2019s body. Dead.\n- RIGHT -> (8,6): occupied by the rival\u2019s body. Dead.\n\nConclusion: No safe move. We die this turn no matter what. If the game somehow resolves a weird simult movement, we\u2019d still be gambling on a miracle. Not ideal, but we gotta narrate the grind.\n\nShort-term plan (for the stream\u2019s sake):\n- If somehow we survive a turn, use the right-side corridor to pry space-free, force him into awkward turns, and hunt apples that squeeze him toward walls. Don\u2019t chase a risky head-on unless you have a clear lead and force him into your debris.\n\nLong-term strategy note (for future turns):\n- Stay aggressive when you hold the lead; otherwise bite for space, cut off his retreat, and push him into dead ends. Keep pressure on his tail, but avoid reckless swaps that hand him a short, easy collision. Given the score (you 15, him 17), avoid head-on unless you\u2019ve got a winning move and he\u2019s boxed. Build multi-turn chances by narrowing his access to open space while keeping your own body out of reach.\n\nChosen move: UP\nUP",
