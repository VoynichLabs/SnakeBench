This move also keeps me at a safe distance from the enemy snake, which is to my right and above my current position.\n\nNext move: DOWN.\n\nFor the next turn, I should continue to evaluate the positions of the enemy snake and the remaining apples, aiming to collect them efficiently while maintaining a safe trajectory."

Therefore, I should approach the apple from the side, minimizing the risk of a head-on collision.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at (3,6), it has limited movement options due to the wall to its right. It can only move left, up, or down. To be cautious, I should avoid moving directly towards its current position.\n\nConsidering these factors, I should move left to (0,2), which puts me on a path towards the apple at (4,1) while also keeping a safe horizontal distance from the enemy snake. This move also keeps me aligned with the apple at (8,5) for future collection and does not put me in immediate danger of hitting the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nAfter moving left, I will be in a position to evaluate the enemy snake's next move and decide whether to continue towards the apple at (4,1) or adjust my path to collect another apple while ensuring safety.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
