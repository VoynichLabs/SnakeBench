We\u2019re going to press the initiative but stay sharp.\n\nDecision Process:\n- Consider all four directions from our head at (7,8): UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8).\n- Safety check: All four targets are empty and within bounds. None collide with our body this turn (our tail will shift as we move).\n- Pressure assessment: Ensnaring the opponent now helps our score leverage later; we want to threaten a box without risking a fatal head-on or self-collision.\n- Best option: Move RIGHT to (8,8) to step onto the tail\u2019s current square (which will vacate) and place us directly in the opponent\u2019s lane, enabling future constriction while keeping escape routes open.\n\nPlan and rationale:\n- By going RIGHT, we relocate into the same x-column as Snake #0, setting up potential cross-confines on the next few turns. It keeps multiple escape options (up, down, or back left) and doesn\u2019t invite an immediate crash this turn.\n- The opponent has moves UP (8,7), LEFT (7,6), or RIGHT (9,6). None of these force a fatal collision on their side this turn, so we should be able to respond with a tightening maneuver next turn.\n- Long-term: push to carve a boxed corridor near x=7\u20138 while watching for corner traps; avoid trading too much space with the enemy.\n\nChosen move: RIGHT",

RIGHT would crash into their own body (8,6) this turn, so it\u2019s off the table for them.\n\nPlan: Press DOWN to (8,7). It keeps us in the action zone, lines up with their vertical space, and preserves multiple safe follow-ups (e.g., (8,9), (9,7), or looping back to (8,8)) while avoiding a dangerous head-on.\n\nLong-term strategy: Work toward boxing him in along the 7\u20138 columns, threatening to seal him into a corridor, but avoid risky head-to-head trades until we have the lead.

Yes, no enemy occupies that cell right now.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,\u202f6) \u2013 also an apple, but it pushes us further from the enemy and leaves a long tail on the right that could trap us later.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,\u202f5) \u2013 empty, no apple, moves us away from any immediate gain.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,\u202f6) \u2013 that cell is part of our own body, so it's instant death.
