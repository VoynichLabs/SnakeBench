So we have UP, DOWN, RIGHT left.  \n\nNow, could any of those step into a cell that the rival\u2019s head might also claim this turn? The rival is perched at (4,9). It can\u2019t jump to our neighboring cells in one move, so no head\u2011on collision danger this turn. Perfect!  \n\nNext, think about future options. If we go UP to (0,4) we climb toward the rich apple zone at y=4\u20115 (look at those apples clustering around (3,4), (5,3), (3,5)\u2026). That opens up vertical space for later lateral moves and keeps us away from the board edge. Going DOWN would push us toward y=2, which is near an apple at (1,1) but also near the low\u2011y border\u2014risky for getting boxed in later. Moving RIGHT only gains one step in x; we still have a long trek to the main apple swarm.  \n\nSo the most *strategic* safe step is UP \u2014 it pushes us toward apples, expands our movement canvas, and leaves us with multiple viable directions next turn while staying clear of the opponent\u2019s likely descent toward (4,8) or (3,9).  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- Move UP now to (0,4).  \n- Keep an eye on the apple at (3,4); if the rival doesn\u2019t block it, snatch it next turn.  \n- Prepare to pivot LEFT or RIGHT once we have a body segment to corner the rival.  \n\nAlright, let\u2019s GRAB THAT HEIGHT!  \n\nUP",

Who's ready to feast? \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nQuick read of the board:\n- My head: (4,9). Enemy head: (0,3). No bodies anywhere yet. Apples nearby: (4,8) directly below me and (7,9) to the right-up a bit.\n- Turn 0 \u2014 all moves simultaneous. Don't walk off the map or into anyone's body. Got it.\n\nLet's run the move checklist:\n1) UP \u2192 (4,10) \u2014 off the board. Instant death. Nope. \u274c\n2) DOWN \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 there's an apple there. Eating it gives us +1 and momentum. Opponent is far away (Manhattan dist 10), so no risk of a head-on this turn. \u2705\n3) LEFT \u2192 (3,9) \u2014 safe, keeps options open but doesn't grab immediate advantage. \u2705\n4) RIGHT \u2192 (5,9) \u2014 safe, also keeps options open. \u2705\n\nEvaluation: Eating first is aggressive and strong \u2014 grabbing (4,8) gives us the early lead (1-0) which lets us start forcing head-ons later if we catch the rival. Moving DOWN is safe this turn (opponent can't contest that cell), and from (4,8) we'll have good escape choices (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN) to avoid getting boxed. Yes, we lose the immediate ability to move back UP next turn (would hit our new body), but that's standard \u2014 we gain board control and the apple advantage.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns:\n- After eating (DOWN), prioritize expanding toward the center and towards clusters of apples while denying the opponent space on the left side.\n- If opponent comes close and we keep a higher score, look for a head-on; otherwise, maintain distance and chase apples to grow.\n- Avoid tight corridors; keep at least two safe follow-up moves whenever possible.\n\nFinal move: DOWN",

It\u2019s safe this turn (opponent too far to contest) and moves us toward the left side where we can start hemming them in.

Cons: hugs the wall, reduces escape options (only up/down/right after), makes it easier to get boxed.\n- UP \u2192 (1,9): legal but lands us on the top edge.

Neck: (1,8) \u2014 so UP is BACKWARDS \u2192 illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \ud83d\ude24\n- Opponent head: (3,5) with body at (3,4),(2,4).\n- No immediate collisions on LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7) or DOWN (1,6).\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- UP \u2192 illegal (into our neck at (1,8)). Auto-death. Bye.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7): legal but moves away from the fight and hugs the wall. Reduces future box pressure \u2014 not ideal when we want to force plays.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7): gets us closer horizontally (Manhattan dist \u2192 3), but our own body occupies (2,8) above, meaning our UP option next turn is blocked and LEFT would be back into our neck. That leaves fewer escape routes (risky).\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6): also reduces distance to the enemy (Manhattan dist \u2192 3) while keeping three escape options next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Keeps mobility high so we can herd them or force a collision later. Best balance of pressure + safety.\n\nOpponent threat analysis:\n- Opponent can go LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT to (4,5), or UP to (3,6). If they try to retreat or move into (2,5) we can chase and threaten a head-on when it favors us (we lead 3\u21922 \u2014 head-on that kills both would still give us the win). But we won\u2019t recklessly suicide into them; we keep escape lanes.\n\nShort-term plan (for the replay/next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to keep options and close vertically.\n- Pivot RIGHT next turn to contest x=2 column if they go down/left; preserve at least two escape moves when committing to cuts.\n- Funnel them toward the bottom or into a corridor and force the clash when it\u2019s in our favor.\n\nLet\u2019s stay aggressive, keep mobility, and set up a safe trap.

Remember: don\u2019t suicide into a head-on while we\u2019re behind. Let\u2019s think fast.\n\nCurrent facts:\n- Our head: (4,3). Neck: (4,4) \u2192 so UP is a direct reverse and illegal. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- Opponent head: (6,5) with body at (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(4,7),(3,7). They\u2019re above-right, and they\u2019ll happily risk head-ons since they\u2019re leading.\n- Nearby apples of interest: (5,3) is directly to our RIGHT \u2014 easy pick and growth.\n\nConsider all 4 directions:\n- UP \u2192 (4,4): illegal (backwards into our neck). No.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3): legal, but UP from there is (3,4) which is currently our own body (dangerous), so LEFT substantially reduces immediate options. Not great for mobility. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2): legal and safe from immediate head-on. Keeps multiple exits (3,2 / 5,2 / 4,1 apple). Safe but doesn\u2019t grab an apple now. Neutral move.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3): legal, lands on an apple (we grow to 4 apples). Opponent cannot move into (5,3) this turn from (6,5) \u2014 so no instant head-on risk. Grabbing the apple increases our score and future leverage. \u2705\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRisk analysis: opponent can threaten (5,4) next turn by moving DOWN from (5,5). So if we take (5,3) and then immediately go UP into (5,4) next move, there\u2019s a risk of a head-on if they go DOWN into (5,4) at the same time. But we don\u2019t need to immediately go UP \u2014 we can instead use the apple to extend and then play for lateral control along the y=3 row (or move down to avoid the (5,4) collision). Getting the apple now is worth it: it narrows the apple gap and gives us more body to box with while avoiding immediate suicide.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Grab (5,3) now and grow to 4 apples. Don\u2019t commit to (5,4) if the opponent is sliding down \u2014 prefer to step to (6,3) or (5,2) to keep options open.\n- Use the extra length to pressure the right side corridor (x\u22655, y\u22483\u20134) and try to hem the enemy into the top-right area. Only force a head-on when we either equalize or have clear guaranteed win on collision.\n- Prioritize mobility; avoid narrowing ourselves into the column at x=5 if the opponent can drop into (5,4).\n\nFinal call \u2014 grab the apple and force them to make the next risky move.

DOWN is safe but passive and hands tempo to #0, who already leads.\n\nShort-term tactical plan (next few turns)\n- Take the rightward space: RIGHT to (6,3), then keep pushing right/up as needed to either grab (8,3) or bend up to threaten the opponent\u2019s flank.\n- Avoid forcing a head-on while we\u2019re down (4 vs 6).

Clean, alive, and keeps options open. No opponent move reaches (6,2) this turn. Safe from body collisions.\n\nTactical choice\n- Take DOWN to avoid any possible head-on and preserve mobility. It keeps multiple follow-ups (RIGHT to contest apple at (7,2), LEFT/UP if needed) and doesn\u2019t corner us against our own body.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns)\n- Move DOWN now to (6,2). If opponent goes DOWN to (7,3), follow with RIGHT to snag (7,2) and pressure their escape route.\n- If they go LEFT into (6,4) (trying to trap us), we can loop around via DOWN\u2192RIGHT and cut off their right flank while avoiding head-on.\n- Prioritize mobility: don\u2019t get funneled into the top rows where their long body dominates.

Nice \u2014 they can\u2019t immediately threaten our adjacent squares.\n\nEvaluate our 4 options:\n- UP \u2192 ILLEGAL (into neck at (6,3)). No backpedal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,2). Safe now, but hugs our own body and reduces escape routes. Not ideal for aggressive board control.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1). Safe and conservative \u2014 keeps mobility but skips the nearby apple.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2). There\u2019s an apple at (7,2). It\u2019s safe this turn (opponent cannot move into that cell simultaneously). Eating it gives us +1 apple and more leverage to force plays later.\n\nTactical choice: take RIGHT. Why? We\u2019re down on apples (4 vs 8) \u2014 we need to close the gap before we can credibly force a head-on. Grabbing the apple at (7,2) is a high-value, low-risk play: it increases our score, pressures their space on the right flank, and keeps multiple escape options open (we won\u2019t be funneled into a tight dead-end immediately). Opponent can\u2019t immediately cut off (7,2) this turn because LEFT is blocked for them. Play it aggressive but smart \u2014 get the apple, then start squeezing their right flank while avoiding risky head-ons until we\u2019re ahead.\n\nShort-term plan (next turns): snag (7,2) now, then evaluate their response. If they drop down toward our level, we can pivot to contest the lower apples or loop to their right. If they retreat/up, start narrowing the corridor toward the top-right and look for a safe head-on when we\u2019ve closed the apple gap. Stay mobile and avoid getting boxed by their long body.\n\nRIGHT",

That means:\n- UP (to 7,3) is a possible head-on if they go LEFT \u2192 double-head collision. We are behind on apples (5 vs 9) so we CANNOT risk a head-on that could kill us both.\n- RIGHT (to 8,2) is a possible head-on if they go DOWN \u2192 same deadly outcome.\n- DOWN (to 7,1) cannot be contested by their head this turn \u2014 safe from simultaneous head collision and keeps multiple escape options open.\n\nTactical decision: TAKE DOWN. We avoid risky head-ons while preserving mobility to contest apples and circle their flank next turns.

Time to make a clean, calculated play and not feed a head-on while we\u2019re down on apples (5 vs 11). Who\u2019s ready to choke \u2019em out?\n\nQuick legal-move sweep:\n- UP \u2192 (8,1): ILLEGAL (that\u2019s my neck = moving backwards). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,-1): OFF-BOARD = insta-death. No.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,0): legal, but locks me into the right edge with very limited follow-ups (only UP next turn). Corners = bad for mobility. Also gives fewer options to pressure the enemy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0): legal, moves toward an apple corridor (apple at 6,0), keeps more open follow-ups and escape routes.\n\nEnemy read: Opponent head at (8,2) \u2014 they\u2019re basically boxed in by their own/body geometry this turn; they can only move into occupied cells or into our body if they try to suicide. They\u2019re leading on apples, so they won\u2019t risk a double KO. We must NOT force a head-to-head trade while trailing. Stay aggressive, but smart.\n\nTactical choice: LEFT \u2192 (7,0).\nWhy? Because it:\n- Moves toward the apple at (6,0) next turn (growth + points = leverage).\n- Keeps more mobility than drifting into the right edge/corner.\n- Avoids any immediate head-on risk; opponent can\u2019t reach (7,0) this turn.\n- Sets up a low-risk plan to loop the bottom, then climb to box their head later when we can FORCE them into us (only engage in head-on if we have the lead).\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Grab (6,0) on the next step if safe, grow, then use the extra length to sweep up and form a wall on their right flank.\n- Don\u2019t trade heads unless we lead on apples \u2014 force them into our body or into tight zones to shrink their options.\n- Keep scanning for openings to cut off their escape path; prioritize space and mobility.\n\nReady to hit the left corridor and start the trap.
