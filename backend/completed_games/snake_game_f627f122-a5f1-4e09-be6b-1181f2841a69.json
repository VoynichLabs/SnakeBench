The closest apple is at (1, 4).\n\nGiven the current position and the goal to maximize points, the best immediate move is to head towards the nearest apple. Moving UP or RIGHT would be the most direct paths to the apple at (1, 4).\n\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (0, 1), which is not directly towards the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to (1, 0), which is closer to the apple at (1, 4).\n\nSince moving RIGHT is the most direct path to the apple, it is the best move.\n\n**Strategy**: Continue moving towards the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy snake and walls.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"
