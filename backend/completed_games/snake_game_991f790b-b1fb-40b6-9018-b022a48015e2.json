Since both snakes start with no body, the immediate collision risk is low. However, we are on a collision course if we both move toward each other (e.g., if I move UP and enemy moves DOWN, we'd meet at (1,7) or similar).\n\n2. **My safety:** I have no body, so I cannot self-collide. The only immediate threats are:\n   - Moving off-board (impossible from (1,5))\n   - Moving into enemy body (enemy has none yet)\n   - Potential head-on collision with enemy's head this turn\n\n3. **Apple proximity:** The closest apples to my head are:\n   - (1, 0) - 5 cells DOWN\n   - (2, 0) - 5 cells DOWN and 1 RIGHT\n   - (1, 5) - I'm at (1,5) but there's no apple at this coordinate according to the list\n   - (5, 4) - 4 RIGHT and 1 DOWN\n   - (6, 5) - 5 RIGHT and 0 vertical\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Early game:** Collect apples while avoiding the enemy. Since apples give growth and points, early collection is valuable.\n- **Space control:** I need to avoid getting trapped. The board has many apples but also empty spaces.\n- **Enemy prediction:** The enemy is at (1,9). They might move DOWN toward apples at (1,0) and (2,0), or move RIGHT/LEFT to explore. If they move DOWN, moving UP would be risky.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1. **UP (to (1,6)):** \n   - Safe: no immediate collision\n   - Moves me closer to enemy (distance becomes 3 cells instead of 4)\n   - Risk of head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN\n   - Not directly toward any apple (nearest apple in UP direction is far)\n\n2. **DOWN (to (1,4)):**\n   - Safe: no immediate collision\n   - Moves me toward apples at (1,0) and (2,0) (DOWN and slightly RIGHT)\n   - Creates distance from enemy (good for avoiding head-on)\n   - Opens path to left side of board\n\n3. **LEFT (to (0,5)):**\n   - Safe: within board\n   - Moves me toward left edge\n   - Nearest apples in this direction are (0,?) but none listed at x=0 (except maybe (2,0) which is DOWN-RIGHT)\n   - Might trap me near left wall later\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (2,5)):**\n   - Safe: within board\n   - Moves me toward apples at (2,0), (2,5), and (4,5)\n   - (2,5) has an apple! This is the closest apple to my current position.\n   - Opens central board access\n\n**Best Immediate Move: RIGHT**\n- I can reach an apple at (2,5) in one move.\n- Moving RIGHT gives me access to multiple apples in the central area: (2,5), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n- This also moves me away from the enemy (who is at (1,9) on same x-coordinate), reducing collision risk.\n- The enemy likely won't move RIGHT immediately since they're near the top-left corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nCollect apples in the central cluster (2,5), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) while maintaining escape routes. Avoid the enemy until I have enough body length to control space. Monitor enemy's movement patterns to anticipate their apple collection strategy.\n\n**Final Decision:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

From (1,8) I have four onward moves (good flexibility) and I'm moved away from the top edge.\n- LEFT -> (0,9): empty, legal. Fewer onward options (edge at left), moves me away from the closest apple.\n- RIGHT -> (2,9): empty, legal. Also moves toward apple (4,8) but gives fewer follow-up options than DOWN (top edge blocks UP from there).\n\nHead-on / collision considerations:\n- Enemy head at (1,5) cannot reach any of (1,8),(0,9),(2,9) in one move, so none of the three legal moves cause an immediate head-on collision.\n- Prefer moves that keep many future options and reduce chance of getting trapped near the board edge.\n\nDecision and short-term plan:\n- Choose DOWN to (1,8): it reduces distance to the nearest apple (4,8), gives the most follow-up options, and avoids the top-edge constraint. Over the next few turns I\u2019ll continue toward (4,8) and prioritize staying in open space to avoid being cornered by the opponent. If the opponent comes up the same column, I will avoid direct head-on approaches and instead circle to secure nearby apples while preserving escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, looking at the board, at (2,5) there's \"1\" (my snake), not an apple. But the apple list includes (2,0), (4,5), etc. Let me check: (2,5) is my head position, no apple there. The apple at (4,5) is to my right-down.\n- My previous move was RIGHT to (2,5). I didn't get an apple at (2,5) - that was just my movement choice.\n\n**Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n1. **Self-collision:** My body is at (1,5). If I move LEFT back to (1,5), I would hit my own body and die. So LEFT is eliminated.\n2. **Enemy collision:** Enemy at (1,8). If I move UP to (2,6), distance is 2 cells vertically. If enemy moves DOWN to (1,7), distance becomes 1 cell (diagonal). If both move appropriately, could we collide? \n   - Enemy at (1,8) moving DOWN to (1,7)\n   - Me at (2,5) moving UP to (2,6)\n   - These are adjacent but not same cell - no collision.\n   - However, if enemy moves DOWN to (1,7) and I move UP to (2,6), we're not colliding.\n   - But if enemy moves RIGHT to (2,8) and I move UP to (2,6), still no collision.\n   - The real risk is if enemy moves DOWN-LEFT to (0,7) and I move UP-LEFT to (1,6) - but I can only move orthogonally.\n   - Actually, no direct head-on collision possible this turn since we're not aligned in a way that same-move would put us in same cell.\n\n3. **Board boundaries:** All moves keep me on board.\n\n**Apple Accessibility:**\nFrom (2,5), apples I can reach:\n- (4,5): 2 RIGHT - reachable in 2 moves\n- (5,4): 3 RIGHT, 1 DOWN - reachable in 4 moves\n- (6,5): 4 RIGHT - reachable in 4 moves\n- (2,0): 5 DOWN - reachable in 5 moves\n- (1,0): 6 DOWN-LEFT - reachable in 7 moves\n- (4,2): 2 RIGHT, 3 DOWN - reachable in 5 moves\n- (4,5): same as above\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1. **UP to (2,6):**\n   - Safe? Check cell (2,6): Looking at board, row 6 shows \". . . . . . . . A .\" so (2,6) is empty (dot).\n   - No self-collision: my body is at (1,5), not (2,6)\n   - No enemy body collision: enemy body is empty\n   - Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (1,8). If enemy moves DOWN to (1,7), I move UP to (2,6) - safe (different cells).\n   - Future options: Opens path to apples at (4,5) and upper board area.\n   - Distance to apples: Moves me closer to (4,5) and (6,5).\n\n2. **DOWN to (2,4):**\n   - Safe? (2,4) is empty (row 4: \". . . . . A A . . .\" so (2,4) is dot)\n   - No self-collision: my body is at (1,5), not (2,4)\n   - No enemy collision\n   - Future options: Opens path to apples at (2,0), (4,2), (4,5) (via RIGHT then UP)\n   - Distance to apples: Moves toward (2,0) and (4,2)\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,5):**\n   - **UNSAFE** - This is my body segment. Moving here would cause self-collision and death.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,5):**\n   - Safe? (3,5) is empty (row 5: \". T 1 . A . A . . A\" so (3,5) is dot)\n   - No self-collision\n   - No enemy collision\n   - Future options: Direct path to apple at (4,5) in one more RIGHT move\n   - Distance to apples: Very close to (4,5) - can reach in 1 move\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- LEFT is eliminated (self-collision)\n- UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are all safe moves\n- RIGHT gets me closest to an apple (4,5) in one more move\n- RIGHT also keeps me in central board, avoiding edges\n- UP is good for exploring but apples in upper area are more spread out\n- DOWN goes toward lower apples but I'm already at y=5, going down to y=4 gets me closer to (4,2) and (2,0)\n\n**Considering enemy behavior:**\nEnemy at (1,8) has apples above (none listed above y=8 except maybe (9,9) but not in list) and below (several at y=7,6,5,4,2,1,0). They might move DOWN toward apples at (4,7) or (6,7) or toward the cluster at lower y. If they move DOWN, staying at my current y or moving RIGHT seems safe.\n\n**Best move: RIGHT to (3,5)**\n- Safest immediate move (no collision risk)\n- Gets me adjacent to apple at (4,5) for next turn\n- Avoids moving toward enemy (who is at y=8, I'm at y=5)\n- Maintains central board position\n- Allows multiple follow-up options: RIGHT to (4,5) for apple, UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), LEFT back to (2,5) (but that would be my body next turn)\n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (3,5) this turn, my body will be at [(2,5), (1,5)] after the move. Next turn, I cannot move LEFT back to (2,5) because that would be my body. But that's fine - I'll have other options.\n\n**Long-term plan:** \nMove RIGHT to (3,5) to position myself for apple at (4,5). After eating (4,5), move to collect the cluster of apples in the central-right area: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). Monitor enemy movement - if they head toward the lower-left apples (1,0), (2,0), I'll focus on central-right. If they go central-right, I may need to adjust. Keep escape routes open and avoid getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

Directly toward apple at (4,8); keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/DOWN/RIGHT).\n\nImmediate safety:\n- None of the four moves would hit a snake body or go off-board this turn.\n- Enemy is too far to force a head-on this turn; their head is 4 Manhattan steps from the apple at (4,8), while I'm 2 steps away, so I can reach (4,8) before them if I continue right.\n\nReasoning and choice:\n- Prioritize getting to (4,8) quickly (high-value nearby apple) while preserving escape routes. RIGHT advances directly toward that apple and keeps options (up/down/right) on the next turn.\n- UP would hug the top edge and reduce flexibility. DOWN is reasonable but slower to the (4,8) apple. LEFT wastes progress and moves toward a wall.\n- Risk assessment: enemy could try to contest apples from below, but I arrive at (4,8) sooner, so taking the direct path is the safest/aggressive plan.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue to (4,8) to eat that apple. After eating, prefer to collect nearby apples (e.g., (4,7), (6,7), (6,5)) while avoiding head-on approaches from enemy.

It's more central and gives better future options (can go to (6,4), (4,4), (5,3), or (5,5) if needed)\n  2. It positions me away from enemy territory\n  3.

          "rationale": "**TURN 6 ANALYSIS**\n\n**Current State (after my last move RIGHT to (6,4)):**\n- My head: (6,4) - I just ate the apple here, so I grew.\n- My body: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (I added a segment at (6,4), so the tail (3,5) moves away).\n- Enemy head: (5,7) (enemy moved DOWN from (4,7) to (5,7)).\n- My apples: 4 (just ate at (6,4))\n- Enemy apples: 2\n- Turn: 6 / 150\n\n**Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n1. **Self-collision:**\n   - UP to (6,5): Empty and contains an apple (from board state).\n   - DOWN to (6,3): Empty (board shows A at (4,3), (5,1), (6,0), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (9,5), etc., but (6,3) is empty).\n   - LEFT to (5,4): **UNSAFE** - this is my second body segment (first after head).\n   - RIGHT to (7,4): Empty.\n\n2. **Enemy collision:** Enemy head is at (5,7). Manhattan distance from my head (6,4) is |6-5| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4. If I move UP to (6,5), enemy might move DOWN to (5,6) or other directions, distance remains safe. If I move RIGHT to (7,4), distance increases. If I move DOWN to (6,3), distance remains safe. No immediate head-on collision risk from enemy.\n\n3. **Board boundaries:** All moves keep me on board.\n\n**Apple Analysis:**\n- (6,5): UP - **Apple** - Immediate gain\n- (7,4): RIGHT - No apple (apples at (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (9,5) are nearby)\n- (6,3): DOWN - No apple (apple at (5,1) is two moves away via (6,2) or (5,2))\n- (5,4): LEFT - Unsafe (self-body)\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1. **UP to (6,5):**\n   - Safe: empty cell\n   - **Contains an apple** - will grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\n   - After eating, body becomes [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n   - Positions me at (6,5) which is adjacent to (6,4) (my current head) but I can't go back. However, from (6,5) I can go UP to (6,6), RIGHT to (7,5), LEFT to (5,5), DOWN to (6,4) (unsafe). So next options: UP, RIGHT, LEFT.\n   - (6,6) is empty, (7,5) is empty, (5,5) is my body segment (unsafe). So UP and RIGHT are safe next turn.\n   - Also near (7,7), (8,6), (8,5) apples for later.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,3):**\n   - Safe: empty cell\n   - No apple\n   - Positions me toward (5,1) apple via (6,2) or (5,2). But (6,2) is empty, (5,2) is empty, (5,1) is apple. However, enemy is at (5,7) - not an immediate threat but could move down.\n   - From (6,3), next moves: UP (6,4) unsafe, DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). So safe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (7,4):**\n   - Safe: empty cell\n   - No apple\n   - Positions me near (7,7), (8,6), (8,5) apples. (7,4) is adjacent to (7,5) (empty), (8,4) (empty), (7,3) (empty), (6,4) (unsafe). So safe next moves: UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), RIGHT to (8,4).\n   - (7,5) is empty, (8,4) is empty, (7,3) is empty. All safe.\n   - Also avoids potential conflict with enemy if enemy moves toward x=6 area.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- LEFT is eliminated (self-collision)\n- UP gives immediate apple and good positioning for next apple chain (toward (7,7), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5))\n- DOWN is safe but no immediate benefit and goes away from the cluster of apples on the right side (apples at (7,7), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5) are all in upper right).\n- RIGHT is safe but no immediate apple, though it moves toward the same apple cluster.\n\n**UP to (6,5) is the best choice:**\n1. Immediate apple gain (points +1)\n2. Positions me at (6,5) which is adjacent to (7,7) (two moves away: (6,5)\u2192(7,5)\u2192(7,6)\u2192(7,7) or (6,5)\u2192(7,5)\u2192(8,5) is also apple)\n3. After eating at (6,5), I can target (7,7) or (8,6) or (8,5) next. From (6,5), I can go RIGHT to (7,5), then UP to (7,6) or RIGHT to (8,5) (apple). So multiple options.\n4. Stays in the central-right area where many apples are located.\n5. Maintains distance from enemy (still at (5,7), I'm at (6,5) after move, distance |6-5| + |5-7| = 1+2=3).\n6. Avoids going down toward (5,1) which is a bit isolated and might lead to a dead end later.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move UP to (6,5) - eat apple and grow\n2. Next turn: target (7,7) or (8,6) or (8,5) - all reachable within 2-3 moves\n3. Sweep the upper right corner apples: (7,7), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5)\n4. Keep distance from enemy (Snake #0) who is likely to go for apples in upper left or middle (apples at (4,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0), etc.)\n5. Monitor enemy movements to avoid convergence; if enemy heads toward my area, consider changing path to block or avoid.\n\nUP",

Body follows: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5).\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 head at (7,7), body segments at (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (4,8). He is 2 cells above me in the same column.\n- **Apples:** Multiple in my vicinity, notably (8,5) one step to the right, and (7,7) one step up (currently occupied by enemy head, so not viable). Others include (9,5), (8,6), (8,2), etc.\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - **UP to (7,6):** Currently empty. However, the enemy head at (7,7) is directly above. If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6) simultaneously, we collide head-on and both die. This is a high-risk move.\n  - **DOWN to (7,4):** Currently empty (board shows 'A' at (7,3) and snake segments elsewhere). No immediate collision risk.\n  - **LEFT to (6,5):** This is my own body segment (first one behind my head). Moving here is illegal/suicide.\n  - **RIGHT to (8,5):** Currently an apple. This is safe (no body/obstacle) and guarantees growth.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n1.  **Avoid Head-on Collision:** The enemy is positioned directly above me. Moving UP creates a dangerous chance of simultaneous collision if the enemy moves DOWN. Given the enemy's score is close to mine (4 vs 5) and they likely want apples, they might move down to intercept or access apples. I should prioritize avoiding this risk.\n2.  **Resource Acquisition:** The apple at (8,5) is immediate and safe to grab by moving RIGHT. This increases my score to 6 and grows my length, giving me a buffer.\n3.  **Positioning:** Moving RIGHT to (8,5) places me on the right side of the board, near a cluster of apples ((9,5), (8,6)). This gives me future options: I can continue up to (8,6) or right to (9,5), or even pivot down if needed. Moving DOWN to (7,4) or UP to (7,6) traps me somewhat between the board edges or my own body and the enemy's potential path.\n4.  **Enemy Behavior Prediction:** The enemy (Snake #0) is at (7,7) with body trailing down-left. They are likely hunting apples in the upper area (e.g., (8,6), (9,5)) or maintaining position. Moving RIGHT puts me in a position to compete for the upper-right apple cluster without immediately engaging in a risky head-on confrontation.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (8,5). This secures an apple, avoids the immediate threat of head-on collision with Snake #0, and positions me advantageously for future moves in the upper-right quadrant.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the apple at (8,5). Assess enemy movement. If safe, proceed toward (8,6) or (9,5). Maintain distance from Snake #0 to avoid mutual destruction. Keep the tail end in mind to avoid self-collision as the snake grows.\n\nRIGHT",

I just ate the apple at (8, 5), growing to length 7. My tail is at (4, 5) and will not move this turn because I grew.\n- **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 head at (8, 7). Body: [(7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7)]. The enemy is directly above me at (8, 7), 2 cells away.\n- **Apples:** I am standing on the apple at (8, 5), which is now gone. Nearby apples: (8, 6) is directly above, (9, 5) is to the right. The enemy is adjacent to (8, 6) and (9, 5).\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - **UP to (8, 6):** This cell contains an apple, but the enemy is at (8, 7). If the enemy moves DOWN, we collide head-on and both die. This is a high-risk move. However, if the enemy moves UP or RIGHT, this is safe.\n  - **DOWN to (8, 4):** Currently empty. This is safe from immediate collision.\n  - **LEFT to (7, 5):** This is my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving here is illegal/suicide.\n  - **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Currently empty. This is safe.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n1.  **Avoid Head-on Collision:** The enemy is at (8, 7). Moving UP to (8, 6) risks a head-on collision if the enemy moves DOWN. Given the proximity, the enemy might move DOWN to cut me off or access apples. I should be cautious but not paralyzed.\n2.  **Resource Acquisition:** I just ate. There are no immediate apples in adjacent cells that are perfectly safe. (8, 6) is an apple but risky. (9, 5) is empty but a potential target for the enemy.\n3.  **Positioning:** My tail is at (4, 5) and won't move, giving me a \"safe zone\" behind me. Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) places me on the edge of the board. Moving DOWN to (8, 4) moves me away from the enemy but towards the bottom. Moving UP to (8, 6) is the aggressive play for the apple.\n4.  **Enemy Behavior Prediction:** The enemy is at (8, 7). They have apples at (8, 6) and (9, 5) in their immediate vicinity. They are likely to move DOWN to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 5). If they move DOWN, moving UP is fatal. If they move RIGHT, moving UP is safe. If they move UP, moving UP is safe. Statistically, moving DOWN or RIGHT are safer than moving UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (8, 4). This is the safest move that keeps me alive. It avoids the direct head-on collision risk with the enemy moving DOWN. It also keeps me relatively close to the center of the board and my tail, maintaining a \"safe zone\". From (8, 4), I can observe the enemy's next move and pivot towards apples on the next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Prioritize survival. Avoid direct confrontation with Snake #0. From (8, 4), plan to move towards the apple cluster at (5, 1) or (4, 3) or (4, 2) on subsequent turns if the upper right quadrant becomes too contested.\n\nDOWN",

A head-on collision on (8,6) would kill us both; because the enemy leads on apples, that outcome would lose for me. DOWN is therefore too risky.\n- UP -> (8,8): safe. Keeps options (8,9),(9,8),(7,8) available. Moves away from the apple cluster, though, and is slightly passive.\n- RIGHT -> (9,7): safe. Keeps a path toward the SE apple cluster (I can go DOWN next to (9,6) then (9,5) if the situation allows) while avoiding an immediate head-on on (8,6). From (9,7) I have at least two good follow-up options (9,8 or 9,6).\n\nLong-term plan: Move to (9,7) now to avoid the contested (8,6) head-on.

Next turn I can move DOWN to (8, 2) to eat.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 4), next turn I can move DOWN to (7, 3) to eat.\nBoth options lead to an apple in 2 turns.\nHowever, (8, 2) is closer to my current position (distance 1).\nLet's check the enemy's access to these apples.\nEnemy at (9, 7).\nApple at (8, 2): Distance for enemy = |9-8| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6.\nApple at (7, 3): Distance for enemy = |9-7| + |7-3| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nDistance for me to (8, 2): |8-8| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2.\nDistance for me to (7, 3): |8-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nBoth are equally distant for me.\nBut if I move DOWN to (8, 3), I am on the same column as the apple (8, 2).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 4), I am on the same row (roughly) as the apple (7, 3).\nLet's consider safety.\nMy body blocks UP.\nEnemy is at (9, 7).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 4), I am moving away from the enemy column (8 and 9).\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 3), I am staying in the enemy's column (8).\nThe enemy is at (9, 7), but might move LEFT to (8, 7).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 7), and I move DOWN to (8, 3), we are far apart.\nWait, is there any risk of the enemy entering my body?\nMy body is at (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 4), my body becomes (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5)...\nThe enemy at (9, 7) cannot hit my body this turn.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 3), my body becomes (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)...\nEnemy at (9, 7) cannot hit my body this turn.\nBoth moves are safe.\nWhich move offers better future options?\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 4), I can next go:\n- DOWN to (7, 3) -> Eat apple.\n- LEFT to (6, 4) -> Safe.\n- RIGHT to (8, 4) -> Back to previous spot.\n- UP to (7, 5) -> My own body (illegal).\nSo from (7, 4), I have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3), I can next go:\n- DOWN to (8, 2) -> Eat apple.\n- LEFT to (7, 3) -> Eat apple.\n- RIGHT to (9, 3) -> Safe.\n- UP to (8, 4) -> Safe.\nSo from (8, 3), I have 4 safe moves.\n(8, 3) seems more open.\nAlso, (8, 3) is the direct route to (8, 2).\n(8, 2) is a \"free\" apple (no snake adjacent currently).\nLet's verify adjacent to (8, 2).\nRow 2: `. . A . A . . . A .`\nCoordinates: (2,2) A, (4,2) A, (8,2) A.\nAdjacent to (8, 2):\n- (8, 3): My potential spot.\n- (7, 2): Empty.\n- (9, 2): Empty.\n- (8, 1): Empty (Row 1: `. . . . . A . . .

So (8, 1) is empty.\nSo (8, 2) is isolated.\nIf I go to (8, 3), I can secure (8, 2) next turn.\nIf I go to (7, 4), I am competing for (7, 3).\n(7, 3) is adjacent to (6, 3), (8, 3), (7, 2), (7, 4).\n(7, 3) is also an apple.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 3: `. . . . A . . A . .`\n(4, 3) and (7, 3).\n(4, 3) is surrounded by walls or empty? (4, 3) is apple. (5, 3) is empty. (3, 3) empty.\n(7, 3) is apple.\nI am at (8, 4).\n(8, 2) is the closest apple.\nI will move DOWN to (8, 3).\nThis prepares me to eat (8, 2) or (7, 3) next turn.\nIt also keeps me on the right side of the board, away from the enemy (who is at 9,7) but not trapped on the edge.\nWait, (9, 4) is the edge.\n(8, 3) is safe.\n\nLet's double check the \"do not move into your own body\" rule.\nMy body: `[(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)]`\nMoving DOWN to (8, 3): New body `(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)...`\n(8, 5) is my old head position.\n(8, 3) is not in my body.\n(8, 4) will become body.\n(8, 3) is empty.\nCorrect.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy at (9, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3), enemy moves.\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (9, 6), safe.\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8, 7), safe.\nIf enemy goes UP to (9, 8), safe.\nNo head-on collision possible.\n\nWhat about the apple at (9, 5)?\nThat is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 3), I am not getting it.\nThe enemy is at (9, 7).\nDistance for enemy to (9, 5) is 2.\nDistance for me to (9, 5) is |8-9| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nThe enemy will likely get (9, 5) before I can.\nI should focus on (8, 2) and (7, 3).\n\nDecision: Move DOWN to (8, 3).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove DOWN to (8, 3) to align with the apple at (8, 2) and open up paths to (7, 3) and the lower-left apple cluster. Avoid the enemy who is at (9, 7) and likely targeting (9, 5). Securing (8, 2) next turn is the priority.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Important: enemy head is at (8,4) and its neck is at (8,5), so the enemy cannot move UP into (8,5) (that would be moving into its neck).

If we take it we will grow, but from (9,5) we still have a comfortable escape route downward to (9,4) and along the right column; LEFT (8,5) is currently enemy body so not safe, UP would be back into the neck. Overall DOWN gives more open space to continue collecting apples along the right edge (e.g., (9,1)).\n\nEnemy situation:\n- Enemy head is at (8,3) with neck at (8,4).

LEFT (8,6) is an apple but would box us in tightly because of our own body above and the enemy body below. DOWN (9,5) is an apple and keeps better escape options (mainly downward along x=9). Given we need apples and must avoid self-trapping, DOWN is the safer, higher-value choice.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take (9,5) this turn.

          "rationale": "Let me analyze the current state and determine the safest and most strategic move.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board state and all positions:\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (8, 2), body goes through (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): Head at (9, 5), body at (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)\n- Apples are scattered: (4, 2), (9, 1), (2, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (1, 0), (8, 6), (4, 3), (2, 2), (5, 9), (2, 5), (7, 3), (4, 8), (1, 1), (3, 8)\n\nLet me check each possible move from my head (8, 2):\n\n**UP (to 8, 3):**\n- Current body occupies (8, 3) as the second segment\n- This is directly backwards into my own body (the segment immediately behind my head)\n- This is a legal death condition (moving directly backwards into your own body)\n- **NOT SAFE**\n\n**DOWN (to 8, 1):**\n- Check if it's on the board: Yes, (8, 1) is within 0-9 for both coordinates\n- Check my own body: Looking at my body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)]\n  - (8, 1) is not in my body\n- Check enemy snake body: Enemy is at (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)\n  - (8, 1) is not in enemy body\n- Check for apple: At (8, 1), there's no apple listed there (apples are at (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (9, 1), (8, 6), etc.)\n  - Actually, looking at the board state, at row 1, column 8 (8, 1) is a '.' (empty)\n- Check enemy head movement: Enemy is at (9, 5). If they move LEFT, they'd go to (8, 5). If they move DOWN, they'd go to (9, 4). If they move UP, they'd go to (9, 6). But (9, 6) is already part of their body. They could move DOWN to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 5). Neither is (8, 1).\n  - However, (9, 1) is an apple. If the enemy moves DOWN from (9, 5) to (9, 4), then down again... no wait, let me think about where the enemy could go.\n  - Enemy head at (9, 5). Possible moves: LEFT to (8, 5) - but (8, 5) is part of my body! So the enemy cannot move LEFT. DOWN to (9, 4) is safe. UP to (9, 6) is blocked by their own body. RIGHT to (9, 5) is off board (9 is max). So only possible move for enemy is DOWN to (9, 4).\n  - (8, 1) is not in their path.\n- This move appears safe. No immediate collision.\n\n**LEFT (to 7, 2):**\n- Check board: (7, 2) is on the board\n- Check my body: (7, 2) is not in my body list\n- Check enemy body: Enemy body is at (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7). (7, 2) is not in enemy body.\n- Check for apple: At (7, 2), looking at board - row 2, column 7 is '.' (empty)\n- Check enemy head: Same analysis as above, enemy likely moves to (9, 4), which is not (7, 2)\n- This move also appears safe.\n\n**RIGHT (to 9, 2):**\n- Check board: (9, 2) is on the board\n- Check my body: (9, 2) is not in my body list\n- Check enemy body: (9, 2) is not in enemy body (enemy body starts at (9, 5))\n- Check for apple: (9, 2) is empty\n- Check enemy head: Enemy at (9, 5) could move DOWN to (9, 4) or possibly other directions if available, but (9, 2) is not in immediate collision path\n- However, (9, 1) is an apple. If I move RIGHT to (9, 2) now, I'm adjacent to that apple for next turn.\n\nWait, I need to think more carefully about simultaneous movement and potential collisions. Let me also consider the apple at (8, 6) which is directly above my current body.\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully:\n- At (8, 6) there's an apple\n- My body goes through (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)\n- So my body is blocking that column\n\nLet me think about strategy:\n1. I have 7 apples, enemy has 5 apples. I'm ahead but not by much.\n2. There's an apple at (9, 1) - I could potentially get it by moving RIGHT to (9, 2) then DOWN to (9, 1)\n3. There's an apple at (7, 3) which is adjacent to where I could be\n4. There's an apple at (4, 2) and others in the lower left area\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy. The enemy is at (9, 5) with a long body. They can only move DOWN to (9, 4) (since LEFT to (8, 5) is blocked by my body, UP is blocked by their own body, and RIGHT is off board).\n\nSo the enemy will move to (9, 4) next turn. That's important.\n\nLet me reconsider my options:\n\n**DOWN to (8, 1):**\n- Safe immediate move\n- (8, 1) is empty\n- Next turn, from (8, 1), I could:\n  - Move DOWN to (8, 0) - check: (8, 0) is on board and empty\n  - Move LEFT to (7, 1) - (7, 1) is empty\n  - Move RIGHT to (9, 1) - (9, 1) has an apple! This is good.\n  - Move UP back to (8, 2) - which would be my previous head position, but that's okay as long as my body has moved\n\n**LEFT to (7, 2):**\n- Safe immediate move\n- (7, 2) is empty\n- Next turn, from (7, 2), I could:\n  - Move UP to (7, 3) - (7, 3) has an apple! Good.\n  - Move DOWN to (7, 1) - empty\n  - Move LEFT to (6, 2) - empty\n  - Move RIGHT to (8, 2) - my old position\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n- Safe immediate move\n- (9, 2) is empty\n- Next turn, from (9, 2), I could:\n  - Move DOWN to (9, 1) - (9, 1) has an apple! Good.\n  - Move UP to (9, 3) - empty\n  - Move LEFT to (8, 2) - my old position\n  - Can't move RIGHT (off board)\n\nActually, let me reconsider the enemy's options more carefully. Enemy is at (9, 5):\n- LEFT to (8, 5): (8, 5) is occupied by my body (third segment from head)\n- UP to (9, 6): (9, 6) is occupied by enemy's own body (first body segment)\n- RIGHT to (9, 5): off board (x=9 is max)\n- DOWN to (9, 4): (9, 4) is empty\n\nSo enemy MUST move DOWN to (9, 4). This is certain.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (9, 2):\n- I'll be at (9, 2)\n- Enemy will be at (9, 4)\n- No collision\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 1):\n- I'll be at (8, 1)\n- Enemy will be at (9, 4)\n- No collision\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 2):\n- I'll be at (7, 2)\n- Enemy will be at (9, 4)\n- No collision\n\nNow considering apples and future opportunities:\n- (7, 3) is an apple, and (7, 2) is adjacent to it\n- (9, 1) is an apple, and (9, 2) or (8, 1) could lead to it\n- (8, 6) is an apple but blocked by my own body\n\nThe apple at (7, 3) seems very attractive. If I move LEFT to (7, 2), then next turn I can move UP to (7, 3) to eat the apple. This also puts me in a better position away from the enemy (who is at the right side of the board).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 2) seems riskier because I'm getting closer to the enemy's position, even though the enemy is moving down to (9, 4). There might be future collision risks.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 1) seems safe but doesn't lead to any immediate apple. From (8, 1), I could go to (9, 1) next turn for that apple, but (7, 3) is closer in terms of turns.\n\nLet me think about the board layout and my body:\n- My body is currently blocking the path at (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)\n- If I move LEFT to (7, 2), I'm starting to move away from that column, which might be good to avoid trapping myself\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about the body movement more carefully. When I move:\n- My head moves to the new position\n- My body segments follow, so the old head becomes the first body segment, and so on\n- The tail moves forward (unless I eat an apple)\n\nSo if I move LEFT to (7, 2):\n- New head: (7, 2)\n- Old head (8, 2) becomes first body segment\n- The rest of the body shifts: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4) all move one position forward\n- The tail (5, 4) moves to (6, 4)\n- So new body would be: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n\nThis means I'm not leaving a gap in my body that would trap me. Actually, my body remains connected.\n\nNow, comparing the options more carefully:\n\n1. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n   - Moves toward apple at (7, 3) for next turn\n   - Gets me away from the right edge where enemy is\n   - Opens up the left side of the board with more apples\n   - Safe immediate move\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 1):**\n   - Moves toward apple at (9, 1) for next turn (but requires RIGHT then)\n   - Keeps me in the middle-lower area\n   - Safe immediate move\n\n3. **RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n   - Moves toward apple at (9, 1) for next turn\n   - Puts me near the enemy's current position (though enemy moves down)\n   - Gets me closer to the edge\n   - Safe immediate move\n\nI think **LEFT to (7, 2)** is the best strategic move because:\n- It positions me to eat (7, 3) next turn\n- It moves me away from the enemy's area (right side)\n- It opens up the left side of the board where there are several apples\n- It avoids the potential future collision with the enemy at the right side\n- It doesn't trap me - I'll have multiple escape routes\n\nLet me also double-check that (7, 2) is not occupied by anything:\n- Board shows at row 2, column 7: '.' (empty)\n- Not in my body\n- Not in enemy body\n- Not an apple\n\nYes, it's safe.\n\nI should also note that the enemy at (9, 5) will move to (9, 4), which is away from me, so no head-on collision risk.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT to (7, 2) to position for eating (7, 3) next turn and move toward the safer left side of the board with more apple opportunities.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove LEFT to (7, 2) to position for eating apple at (7, 3) next turn. This moves away from the enemy's area (right side) and opens up the left side of the board where multiple apples are clustered. After eating (7, 3), consider moving toward the lower-left apple cluster at (4, 2), (2, 2), (1, 1), etc. This strategy keeps me safe from the enemy and positions for multiple future apple opportunities.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**",

My body is at (8, 2), (8, 3), etc. (7, 3) is not in my body. The enemy's body is at (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), etc. - not at (7, 3). This is safe.\n\n**DOWN to (7, 1):** This is empty.

But since my body moves simultaneously, when I move RIGHT to (8, 2), my old body will have moved forward. However, I need to be careful - moving directly backwards into the cell my body just vacated could be problematic.

I need to check all possible moves for safety.\n\n1. **UP to (7, 4):** This cell is empty (based on the board state) and not in my body. Enemy snake #0 is at (9, 3) and moving\u2014based on their previous positioning and the need to avoid walls/their own body, they might move left to (8, 3) or down to (9, 2). Neither (7, 4) nor (8, 3) is occupied by the enemy body. Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 2):** This is currently my body (specifically, my second segment). Moving here would mean I hit myself and die. Unsafe.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 3):** This cell is empty. My body occupies (7, 2), (8, 2), etc.\u2014not (6, 3). The enemy's body is far to the right. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 3):** This is also empty? Wait, let me double-check the board. My body is at (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)... Actually, (8, 3) is listed in my body! Yes, from the initial state: Head (7, 3), Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), ...]. So (8, 3) is my own body. Moving RIGHT into my own body is fatal. Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n\nWhich is better? UP goes to (7, 4), which is closer to apples like (4, 3) and (2, 5) via a path through the center. LEFT goes to (6, 3), which opens up the lower-left cluster. However, considering the enemy's position at (9, 3), they might move left to (8, 3). If I move UP to (7, 4), and the enemy moves left to (8, 3), that's fine\u2014we don't collide. But if I move LEFT to (6, 3) and the enemy moves left to (8, 3), also fine.\n\nBut there's a strategic consideration: the apple at (4, 3) is directly south of (7, 4) (actually west-southwest). Moving LEFT brings me closer to the dense apple cluster in the lower left: (4, 2), (2, 2), (2, 0), etc. From (6, 3), I can go down to (6, 2) (empty) then left to (5, 2) (empty) then left to (4, 2) (apple!). That's a clear path. From (7, 4), the path to that cluster is longer and more circuitous.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT keeps me further from the enemy's potential movement. The enemy is on the far right; moving left increases distance. I should prioritize securing apples in the less-contested left side.\n\nThus, LEFT is the better move.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove LEFT to (6, 3) to approach the lower-left apple cluster. From there, head toward (4, 2), then (2, 2), etc., while monitoring the enemy's moves. Avoid getting trapped against the wall or my own body.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)].\n    *   **Current Board**: The cell (9, 3) is the first segment of the enemy's body. The cell (9, 1) contains an apple. The cell (9, 0) contains an apple.\n    *   **Movement Prediction**:\n        *   **Right (10, 2)**: Off board -> Death.\n        *   **Left (8, 2)**: Currently empty. Valid move.\n        *   **Up (9, 3)**: Currently occupied by the enemy's own body (segment 2). Moving here is suicide -> Death.\n        *   **Down (9, 1)**: Contains an apple (ID 1). Valid move.\n    *   **Intent**: Snake 0 has a strong incentive to go Down to (9, 1) to eat an apple. It is a safe move (not off board, not into own body) and directly in its path. While it *could* go Left, Snakes usually prioritize apples. I must assume Snake 0 will move to (9, 1).\n\n2.  **My Snake (ID 1) Analysis**:\n    *   **Head**: (6, 3).\n    *   **Body**: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)].\n    *   **Safety Check**:\n        *   **UP to (6, 4)**: Empty. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN to (6, 2)**: Empty. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (5, 3)**: Empty. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (7, 3)**: Currently occupied by my own body. **DEATH**. Cannot go Right.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT)**:\n    *   **Option A: UP to (6, 4)**.\n        *   Proximity to apples: (4, 3) is 2 tiles away (Left, Left). (2, 5) is reachable.\n        *   Defense against Snake 0: Snake 0 is predicted to be at (9, 1). Distance is ~3 units (Manhattan or Euc). This is not particularly defensive.\n    *   **Option B: DOWN to (6, 2)**.\n        *   Proximity to apples: (6, 0) is a direct path down (2 tiles). (4, 2) is close.\n        *   Defense against Snake 0: Snake 0 at (9, 1) is 3 tiles away. (6, 2) is actually further left than current (6, 3), so it's moving away from Snake 0.\n    *   **Option C: LEFT to (5, 3)**.\n        *   **Proximity to apples**: (4, 3) is immediately adjacent at (4, 3). (4, 2) is also nearby. This is the most direct path to an apple.\n        *   **Defense against Snake 0**: This move moves **Left**, directly away from Snake 0 (who is on the far right). The Manhattan distance from (5, 3) to (9, 1) is `|5-9| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6`. From (6, 3), the distance is `|6-9| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5`. Moving Left increases the gap between me and the enemy head.\n\n**Strategic Conclusion**:\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 3) is the optimal move. It positions me directly next to the apple at (4, 3) (allowing me to eat it on the next turn if it remains), moves me toward a dense apple cluster in the bottom-left quadrant, and simultaneously increases my distance from the enemy snake who is likely moving to the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n**Long-Term Plan**: Move Left to (5, 3). On the next turn, anticipate moving to (4, 3) to eat the apple, then navigate toward the cluster at (2, 2) and (4, 2). Monitor the enemy's position, but they are currently far on the right side, giving me safe access to the left side resources.\n\nLEFT",

I suspect they moved LEFT to (7, 1) or UP to (8, 2) to chase the apple cluster on the right side. Since (8, 2) is occupied by my body, they likely cannot safely go UP. (7, 2) is also occupied by my body. If they went LEFT to (7, 1), they are safe. If they attempted UP/DOWN into my body, they die, but I cannot rely on that.\n    *   **Apples**: I am standing on (4, 3). Just to my LEFT at (3, 3) is an apple.\n\n2.  **Safety Evaluation**:\n    *   **UP to (4, 4)**: Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 2)**: Contains an apple.

Next turn, I can easily access (2, 2) and (2, 0) which are nearby apples.\n        *   If I go **LEFT to (3, 3)**: I will be at (3, 3). Next turn, I can access (3, 8) or (1, 1) or (2, 0).\n    *   **Enemy Threat**: The enemy is likely approaching (7, 1) or (8, 2) (if they survived). If I go DOWN to (4, 2), I am moving away from them. If I go LEFT, I am also moving away. Both are safe regarding the enemy.\n    *   **Body Safety**: My body extends to the right at (5, 3), (6, 3), etc. Moving LEFT pulls my head away from my body, creating more space and preventing future entrapment.\n    *   **Comparison**:\n        *   Moving DOWN to (4, 2) puts me at the bottom of the board. While safe, it slightly limits my vertical mobility (can't go further down).\n        *   Moving LEFT to (3, 3) keeps me in the center of the board (x=3), providing access to the top and bottom. This is generally better for \"keeping future options open\".\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: LEFT is the optimal move. It secures an apple, moves me away from my body (increasing maneuverability), and keeps me centrally located for the next turn. (4, 2) is also a good option, but (3, 3) is slightly better for board control.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I just ate an apple at (4, 3), so I am now at 10 apples.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0**: Head is at (7, 1). Body: [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)]. I was correct last turn; they moved LEFT to (7, 1). They are currently safely away from me.\n    *   **Apples at (3, 3)**: Gone.

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 2)**: Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 3)**: Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 3)**: Contains my own body (the segment I just left). **DEATH**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision**:\n    *   **Immediate Gain**: No immediate apples at (3, 4), (3, 2), or (2, 3). I must prioritize positioning for future turns.\n    *   **Enemy Threat**: The enemy at (7, 1) is far away. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n    *   **Future Planning**:\n        *   If I go **UP to (3, 4)**: I move towards the center/top. (3, 8) is a target. However, I am moving away from the dense cluster of apples at the bottom left: (2, 2), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1).\n        *   If I go **DOWN to (3, 2)**: I move towards the bottom left cluster. From (3, 2), I have immediate access to (2, 2) next turn. (3, 2) is also safe as it contains an apple? Let me check the board state.\n    *   **Board State Check**:\n        *   Row 2 (y=2): `. . A . A . A T T T`\n        *   At x=3, y=2: `.` (Empty).\n        *   At x=2, y=2: `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Comparison**:\n        *   **UP (3, 4)**: Good for vertical movement, but leaves the bottom cluster for later.\n        *   **LEFT (2, 3)**: Moves towards the cluster. From (2, 3), I can go to (2, 2) (Apple) or (1, 3).\n        *   **DOWN (3, 2)**: Moves towards the cluster. From (3, 2), I can go to (2, 2) (Apple), (3, 1), or (4, 2) (Apple).\n    *   **Optimal Move**: (3, 2) offers the most flexibility. It places me adjacent to (2, 2) and (4, 2). It keeps me in the lower half of the board where apples are currently densest. (2, 3) is also good, but (3, 2) opens up an extra direction (DOWN/RIGHT) compared to (2, 3) which is closer to the left wall.\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: DOWN is the best move. It positions me to grab an apple on the next turn (either (2, 2) or (4, 2)) and keeps my options open.\n\nDOWN",

(Based on the board state drawing, (7, 5) is no longer part of the body at the tail; the tail ends at (8, 5) or (7, 2) depending on movement, but looking at the board state text, the tail is clearly at (8, 5) for y=5, and the line of T's at y=3 and y=2 confirms the body placement).\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0**: Head at (6, 1). Body: [(7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]. He is positioned to the right and slightly below me.\n    *   **Apples**: Several apples surrounding me, specifically (2, 2), (4, 2), (3, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (6, 0).\n\n2.  **Safety Evaluation (Simultaneous Movement)**:\n    *   **My Potential Moves**:\n        *   **UP to (3, 3)**: Contains my own body. **DEATH**.\n        *   **DOWN to (3, 1)**: Empty on board. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (2, 2)**: Contains an apple. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (4, 2)**: Contains an apple. Safe.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0 Potential Moves**:\n        *   **UP to (6, 2)**: Currently empty (apple at (6, 2)? No, check board. Board shows `.` at (6, 2) for Row 2, but Row 2 shows `. . A . A . A T T T`. Wait, (6, 2) is listed as `A` in the board state provided at the start of this turn. *Correction*: The prompt lists `(6, 2)` in the apples list and the board drawing shows `A` at (6, 2) on row 2. If I check the board state text provided in the prompt:\n            Row 2: `. . A . A . A T T T`\n            Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n            At index 6 (x=6), it is `A`. So (6, 2) has an apple.\n            *However*, Enemy Head is at (6, 1). If Enemy moves UP to (6, 2), it eats the apple and grows. If I move RIGHT to (4, 2), I am safe from him. If I move LEFT to (2, 2), I am safe. If I move DOWN to (3, 1), I am safe.\n        *   **DOWN to (6, 0)**: Contains an apple. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (5, 1)**: Empty. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (7, 1)**: Contains Enemy's own body. **DEATH**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning**:\n    *   **Immediate Options**:\n        *   **LEFT (2, 2)**: Eating an apple immediately. This leads to a position near the left wall, potentially limiting escape routes later.\n        *   **RIGHT (4, 2)**: Eating an apple immediately. This leads towards the bottom center, keeping options open towards the bottom-right apple (6, 0) and the rest of the board. It also puts me closer to the enemy's path, but not in immediate collision range (he is at (6,1), I'd be at (4,2)). Distance is 2 cells.\n        *   **DOWN (3, 1)**: Not eating an apple. Moves toward (1,0) and (2,0). This is a slower accumulation strategy.\n\n    *   **Comparison**:\n        *   **RIGHT (4, 2)** seems superior to **LEFT (2, 2)**. Both are apples, but (4, 2) opens up more board space. Moving to (2, 2) traps me against the left wall (x=0). While safe now, it restricts future maneuverability. (4, 2) allows access to (5, 1), (6, 0), or even upward movement later.\n        *   **DOWN (3, 1)** is a safe non-eating move, but since eating is possible and safe, I should eat. Eating grows my body, which is generally a safety advantage (blocks paths for the enemy) and scores points.\n\n    *   **Enemy Prediction**:\n        *   Enemy at (6, 1) has an apple at (6, 0) (DOWN) and (6, 2) (UP). He also sees my head at (3, 2).\n        *   If he moves UP to (6, 2), he eats.\n        *   If he moves DOWN to (6, 0), he eats.\n        *   He is unlikely to move LEFT into empty space (5, 1) if apples are available.\n        *   He cannot move RIGHT.\n        *   Assuming he moves for an apple (which is standard logic), he will likely go UP or DOWN. This puts him vertically aligned with me but separated by distance. I am safe from head-on collision.\n\n    *   **Final Decision**:\n        *   **RIGHT to (4, 2)** offers the best balance of immediate scoring, board control, and future flexibility. It keeps me away from the wall and positions me to potentially intercept the enemy or grab more apples in the center/right.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

From (6,2) UP and RIGHT are dead, DOWN would be moving straight back into my neck (illegal), leaving only LEFT (5,2).

The game is at turn 20, so avoiding walls is becoming a factor.\n\n**Turn 20 Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Current State:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 2)\n    *   **My Body:** [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (5, 1)\n    *   **Enemy Body:** [(6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\n    *   **Apples at (4, 2):** YES.\n\n2.  **Safety & Immediate Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (4, 3):** My body segment is at (4, 3). **DEADLY**.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 1):** Empty. **SAFE**.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 2):** My body segment is at (3, 2). **DEADLY** (Direct backward movement).\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Empty (based on board state `.` at (5,2)). **SAFE**.\n\n    *Strictly speaking*, both UP and LEFT kill me immediately. I must choose between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Strategic Comparison (DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **Option: RIGHT to (5, 2)**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves toward the central apple (6, 2) and keeps me away from the walls.\n        *   **Cons:** This position (5, 2) is **dangerous**. It is adjacent to the Enemy Head at (5, 1). The enemy has a choice to move UP to (5, 2). If the enemy moves UP, our heads collide (both at (5, 2)), resulting in a double death. Considering the game state, I am winning (11 vs 7 apples). Accepting a mutual death is a massive risk; if we tie in apples (which we don't currently, but mutual death gives no points), or if the judge rules based on current scores in a tie-breaker, risking death is bad. Furthermore, the enemy has apples at (6, 0) and (6, 2) available, but (5, 2) is a prime target if they try to cut me off. Moving here invites collision.\n\n    *   **Option: DOWN to (4, 1)**\n        *   **Pros:** Secures the apple at (4, 2) (since we are moving away from it, we eat it). Moves me to (4, 1), which is **safer** relative to the enemy.\n        *   **Cons:** Slightly closer to the bottom wall (y=0). However, we have turns remaining (130).\n        *   **Enemy Interaction:** If I am at (4, 1) and Enemy is at (5, 1), we are side-by-side. The enemy cannot move LEFT to (4, 1) because I am there. The enemy can move UP to (5, 2) or DOWN to (5, 0) (Apple) or RIGHT. This gives me a buffer.\n        *   **Future Moves:** From (4, 1), I can move LEFT to (3, 1) (Apple), UP to (4, 2) (will be empty as I leave it, unless I grow\u2014but I eat now), or DOWN to (4, 0). This preserves options better than being pinned at (5, 2).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    Choosing **DOWN** allows me to eat the apple at (4, 2) safely and positions me in a less confrontational spot relative to the enemy. While (5, 2) allows access to more apples, the risk of head-on collision with the enemy (who is right below at (5, 1)) is too high given my lead. I will take the guaranteed score and safe positioning.\n\nDOWN",

I must ensure I do not move into my own body or the enemy's body.\n\n**Turn 21 Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Current State Check:**\n    *   **My Head:** (4, 1)\n    *   **My Body:** I grew by 1. The new tail is at the old tail (8, 5), and the head moved from (4, 2) to (4, 1). The body occupies: [(4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (5, 0) (based on the board state provided, `0` is at (5, 0)). *Note: The written state list said (5, 0), but the board ASCII art depicts the head as `0` at (5, 0) and body parts at (5, 1), (6, 1), etc. The ASCII art aligns with the board state provided at the start of the turn.*\n    *   **Apples:** I am currently at (4, 1), which contains an apple (`A` in the board state). I will eat it if I stay or move from there. However, I must move to a new tile.\n\n2.  **Move Evaluation (from Head (4, 1)):**\n    *   **UP to (4, 2):** This is currently occupied by my *old* head/body segment. Since I just moved from (4, 2) to (4, 1), (4, 2) is the first segment of my body. Moving back into it is a suicide move. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 0):**\n        *   Is it on the board? Yes, (4, 0) is valid.\n        *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n        *   Is it occupied by enemy body? The enemy body is at (5, 1), (6, 1)... (9, 3). (4, 0) is empty.\n        *   Is it occupied by enemy head? Enemy head is at (5, 0). (4, 0) is adjacent but distinct.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 1):**\n        *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n        *   Is it occupied by my body? No (My body is at x >= 3, y >= 2).\n        *   Is it occupied by enemy body? No.\n        *   **Result:** Safe. (Contains an apple).\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 1):**\n        *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n        *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n        *   Is it occupied by enemy body? **YES.** The board state shows `T` (enemy body) at (5, 1). Moving here kills me. **DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   **Available Moves:** DOWN (4, 0) and LEFT (3, 1).\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 1):**\n        *   Eats an apple immediately (since (3, 1) is `A` on the board).\n        *   Position (3, 1) is relatively central (x=3).\n        *   Enemy head is at (5, 0). If the enemy moves UP to (5, 1), we are 2 units apart horizontally. If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 0), they move to where I *could* have been, but we don't collide. If they move LEFT to (4, 0) and I stay at (3, 1), we are fine.\n        *   Future options from (3, 1): UP (3, 2) is my body (deadly), DOWN (3, 0) is empty, LEFT (2, 1) is empty (apple nearby at 2,0), RIGHT (4, 1) is where I am now (deadly next turn if I loop, but fine for planning).\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 0):**\n        *   Moves to the bottom wall (y=0). While safe for this turn, being at y=0 reduces future vertical maneuvering room.\n        *   Enemy head is at (5, 0). We would be adjacent horizontally.\n        *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 0) on the same turn I move DOWN to (4, 0), we have a head-on collision (both die). This is a risk I should avoid given I have a score lead.\n        *   Future options from (4, 0): UP (4, 1) is empty next turn, LEFT (3, 0) empty, RIGHT (5, 0) is currently enemy head (likely to move or be empty next turn, but risky to chase directly).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 1)** is the superior move. It secures an apple immediately, keeping my score high (12 apples). It avoids the direct horizontal adjacency with the enemy head at (5, 0) that DOWN would create, reducing the risk of a mutual death collision. It keeps me slightly more central than the wall at y=0.\n\nLEFT",

Check collisions:\n    *   My body: The body segments listed for my snake start at (4, 1) and go up to (8, 3) and (8, 2). None of these are at (2, 1).\n    *   Enemy snake body: The enemy body occupies (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1)... (9, 3). (2, 1) is clear.\n    *   Enemy head: Currently at (6, 0). (2, 1) is far away.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. I eat an apple.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** This is the same cell as UP, since my head is at (3, 1) and the apple is at (2, 1). Wait, the board shows `(2, 0), (1, 0), (8, 6), (2, 2), (5, 9), (2, 5), (4, 8), (1, 1), (3, 8), (6, 8), (6, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (2, 8), (1, 2)`.\n    *   Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n    *   Row 1 (y=1): `. A . 1 T T T T T T`\n    *   Row 2 (y=2): `. A A T T . A T T T`\n    *   Row 0 (y=0): `. A A . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   My head is at (3, 1).\n    *   **UP (3, 2):** Board shows `T` (enemy body) at (3, 2). Blocked.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 0):** Board shows `.` (empty) at (3, 0). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1):** Board shows `A` (apple) at (2, 1). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 1):** Board shows `T` (my body) at (4, 1). Blocked.\n\n    *   **Safe moves:** DOWN (3, 0) and LEFT (2, 1).\n    *   **Analysis of LEFT (2, 1):** Eats an apple. Increases score to 12. Good.\n    *   **Analysis of DOWN (3, 0):** Safe. No apple. Moves to bottom row (y=0). Puts me adjacent to enemy head at (6, 0) horizontally.\n\n    *   **Strategy:** I should take the apple if it's safe. Let's check (2, 1) again.\n    *   Enemy head is at (6, 0).\n    *   My body is at (4, 1)...\n    *   Is (2, 1) safe from the enemy head moving this turn?\n        *   If enemy moves LEFT (5, 0), stays (6, 0), or UP (6, 1), it doesn't hit me.\n        *   If enemy moves DOWN (6, -1), it dies off board.\n        *   So (2, 1) is safe from immediate collision with the enemy head.\n\n    *   Let's double check the board coordinates and apple locations provided in the prompt vs the ASCII art.\n    *   Apples at: (2, 0), (1, 0), (8, 6), (2, 2), (5, 9), (2, 5), (4, 8), (1, 1), (3, 8), (6, 8), (6, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (2, 8), (1, 2).\n    *   Wait, the ASCII art shows `A` at (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n    *   The list of apples provided *does not* include (2, 1). It includes (1, 1).\n    *   Let's look at the ASCII art again.\n    *   Row 1: `. A . 1 ...`\n    *   This corresponds to x=0: ., x=1: A, x=2: ., x=3: 1.\n    *   So (1, 1) is an apple. (2, 1) is empty.\n    *   My head is at (3, 1).\n    *   **UP (3, 2):** `T` (Enemy body). Blocked.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 0):** `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1):** `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 1):** `T` (My body). Blocked.\n\n    *   Available moves: DOWN (3, 0) and LEFT (2, 1).\n    *   Neither contains an apple based on the list provided (List: ... (1, 1), ...). The ASCII art matches (1, 1) as an apple. It does *not* show an apple at (2, 1).\n    *   So moving LEFT to (2, 1) is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (3, 0) is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\n    *   **Strategic Comparison:**\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1):** Moves towards the left edge. I see an apple at (1, 1) which is adjacent to (2, 1). I could eat it next turn.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 0):** Moves to the bottom edge. I see apples at (2, 0) and (1, 0) nearby.\n    *   **Enemy (Snake #0):** Head at (6, 0). Body from (5, 0) to (9, 3).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2, 1), I am safe. Next turn I can move to (1, 1) to eat the apple.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3, 0), I am safe. Next turn I can move to (2, 0) or (1, 0) to eat apples.\n\n    *   Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\".\n    *   The user's last move was DOWN to (4, 1). Wait, the user's last move was listed as LEFT in the prompt, but the rationale says DOWN. Let's re-read the prompt.\n    *   \"Your last move information: START LAST MOVE PICK LEFT END LAST MOVE PICK\"\n    *   \"START LAST RATIONALE ... My last move was DOWN to (4, 1)...\"\n    *   There is a discrepancy. The pick says LEFT, but the rationale says DOWN. The rationale also says the head is at (4, 1).\n    *   Let's look at the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section.\n    *   Head: (3, 1).\n    *   Body: [(4, 1), ...]\n    *   This confirms the current head is (3, 1).\n    *   If the last move was DOWN, the head would have moved from (4, 1) to (3, 1)? No, DOWN decreases Y. (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\n    *   If the last move was LEFT, the head would have moved from (4, 1) to (3, 1).\n    *   The body list starts with (4, 1). This implies the previous head was (4, 1) and it moved to (3, 1) (LEFT). The body grows at the tail.\n    *   The prompt's \"Your snake\" section shows Head: (3, 1). Body: [(4, 1), ...].\n    *   This implies the move was indeed LEFT from (4, 1) to (3, 1).\n    *   The rationale text is likely a copy-paste error from a previous turn or just flawed. I should trust the explicit coordinates given for the current state over the narrative text of the \"last move rationale\" if they conflict.\n    *   Current Head: (3, 1).\n    *   Current Body starts at (4, 1).\n    *   So the previous head was (4, 1).\n    *   Move was LEFT to (3, 1).\n\n    *   Now, evaluating moves from (3, 1):\n    *   **UP (3, 2):** Blocked by my body? No, the body is at (4, 1), (4, 2)...\n    *   Wait, the body list is: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3)].\n    *   (3, 2) is in my body. So UP is blocked.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 0):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 1):** In my body (first element). Blocked.\n\n    *   Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n    *   Apples: None at (3, 0) or (2, 1).\n    *   Strategy: Move towards clusters of apples.\n    *   Apples listed: (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n    *   Moving LEFT to (2, 1) positions me perfectly to eat (1, 1) next turn, and then (1, 0) or (1, 2) or (2, 0).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (3, 0) positions me to eat (2, 0) or (1, 0).\n    *   (2, 1) is slightly more central and flexible than (3, 0) which is on the wall.\n\n    *   Enemy snake #0 is at (6, 0). It is far away on the right side.\n    *   I am on the left side.\n    *   Avoiding the wall is generally better to keep options open.\n    *   LEFT to (2, 1) moves me away from the enemy and towards a cluster of 4 apples.\n    *   DOWN to (3, 0) moves me to the wall, but also towards the apples.\n\n    *   Let's consider the collision risk with the enemy.\n    *   Enemy at (6, 0).\n    *   If I go LEFT (2, 1), distance is large. No risk.\n    *   If I go DOWN (3, 0), distance is 3 units. No immediate risk.\n\n    *   Let's look at the apples again.\n    *   (2, 0), (1, 0) are on y=0.\n    *   (1, 1), (1, 2) are on x=1.\n    *   Moving to (2, 1) allows me to pivot to (1, 1) -> (1, 2) or (1, 0).\n    *   Moving to (3, 0) allows me to pivot to (2, 0) -> (1, 0).\n    *   (2, 1) gives me a choice of 3 apples next turn. (3, 0) gives me a choice of 2 apples next turn.\n\n    *   Also, (2, 1) is safer from the wall. If I am on the wall (3, 0) and an enemy chases me to (4, 0) or (2, 0), I have fewer escape routes.\n\n    *   So LEFT (2, 1) seems better.\n\n    *   Wait, let's check the enemy body again.\n    *   Enemy Body: [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)].\n    *   My proposed move LEFT to (2, 1).\n    *   Is (2, 1) in enemy body? No.\n    *   Is (2, 1) in my body? No.\n    *   Is it on board? Yes.\n\n    *   Let's double check the coordinates for (3, 0).\n    *   Board row 0: `. A A . . T 0 . . .`\n    *   x=0: .\n    *   x=1: A (1, 0)\n    *   x=2: A (2, 0)\n    *   x=3: . (3, 0)\n    *   x=4: . (4, 0)\n    *   x=5: T (5, 0) - Enemy body\n    *   x=6: 0 (6, 0) - Enemy head\n    *   x=7: . (7, 0)\n    *   x=8: . (8, 0)\n    *   x=9: . (9, 0)\n\n    *   If I move DOWN to (3, 0), I am safe.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2, 1), I am safe.\n\n    *   Is there any reason to prefer DOWN?\n    *   The enemy is at (6, 0). If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 0), (4, 0), or (3, 0), and I am at (3, 0), we risk collision if it moves to (3, 0) or if it moves to (4, 0) and I move to (4, 0) next turn (head on).\n    *   If I am at (2, 1), I am much safer.\n\n    *   Let's assume the enemy wants to eat apples. The apples on the right are at (8, 6), (4, 8), (3, 8), (6, 8), (6, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (2, 8).\n    *   The apples on the left are (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n    *   The enemy is at (6, 0). He is close to the bottom.\n    *   If he wants to go to (8, 6) or (6, 2), he might go UP or RIGHT.\n    *   If he wants to go to (2, 0) or (1, 0), he will come my way.\n\n    *   However, I have 11 apples, he has 8. I have a lead.\n    *   I should prioritize safety and grabbing the cluster of apples on the left.\n    *   Moving to (2, 1) keeps me away from the bottom edge where the enemy is currently located.\n    *   It also keeps me away from the immediate danger of being trapped against the wall if the enemy comes down.\n\n    *   One detail: My body extends to (4, 1) and (4, 2).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2, 1), my next moves are open.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3, 0), my next moves are (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0).\n    *   (3, 1) will be occupied by my body (it will be the second segment) in the next turn if I don't move back there immediately. But generally, moving away from the body is good.\n\n    *   Let's review the \"Turn 21 Analysis\" in the prompt.\n    *   It says: \"My last move was DOWN to (4, 1)\". This contradicts the \"START LAST MOVE PICK LEFT\".\n    *   It also says: \"Body: I grew by 1... The new tail is at the old tail (8, 5)\".\n    *   The current body list ends with (8, 3).\n    *   The previous body list (implied by the move logic) would have been [(4, 2), (3, 2)...].\n    *   If the head was (4, 1), and the body started with (4, 2).\n    *   If the head moved to (3, 1), the new body starts with (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)...\n    *   The current body is [(4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2)...]\n    *   This confirms the move was LEFT from (4, 1) to (3, 1). The tail (8, 3) remained.\n    *   The text \"My last move was DOWN\" in the rationale is definitely an error in the prompt's template or a hallucination. The coordinates and board state are the source of truth.\n\n    *   Decision: LEFT to (2, 1).\n    *   Why? It moves towards the apple cluster (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0).\n    *   It keeps me away from the wall at y=0 where the enemy is currently idling at (6, 0).\n    *   It provides more maneuvering room than (3, 0).\n    *   It is safe from all obstacles.\n\n    *   Wait, is there an apple at (2, 1)?\n    *   Apples listed: (2, 0), (1, 0), (8, 6), (2, 2), (5, 9), (2, 5), (4, 8), (1, 1), (3, 8), (6, 8), (6, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (2, 8), (1, 2).\n    *   No, (2, 1) is not an apple.\n    *   But (1, 1) IS an apple.\n    *   So I am moving adjacent to an apple.\n    *   From (2, 1), I can reach (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0).\n    *   From (3, 0), I can reach (2, 0), (1, 0).\n    *   (2, 1) is strictly better for future apple access.\n\n    *   Check for traps.\n    *   My body is at (4, 1)... (8, 3).\n    *   Enemy body is at (5, 0)... (9, 3).\n    *   My head is at (3, 1).\n    *   Moving to (2, 1) leaves (3, 1) open in the future (once my body moves past it).\n    *   Actually, in 2 turns, my body will cover (3, 1) and (4, 1).\n    *   But I will be at (1, 1) or similar by then.\n\n    *   Final check on safety of (2, 1).\n    *   Board state at (2, 1): `.` (from ASCII art row 1).\n    *   My body: No.\n    *   Enemy body: No.\n    *   Enemy head: (6, 0). No.\n    *   Next turn enemy head: Max movement 1.\n    *   Even if enemy moves aggressively towards me (improbable given the distance), I am safe this turn.\n\n    *   Let's write down the plan.\n    *   Move LEFT to (2, 1).\n    *   Next turn, target the apple at (1, 1) or (2, 0) or (1, 0).\n    *   Be aware of the enemy snake at (6, 0).\n\n    *   One edge case: The enemy head is at (6, 0). The body is at (5, 0).\n    *   If the enemy moves to (5, 0) (impossible, occupied by body), wait.\n    *   The enemy head is at (6, 0). The body segment is at (5, 0).\n    *   The enemy cannot move into its own body.\n    *   So the enemy cannot move to (5, 0).\n    *   The enemy can move to (6, 1), (7, 0), (6, -1).\n    *   (6, 1) is my body? No. My body is at (4, 1), (4, 2)...\n    *   (6, 1) is Enemy body? Yes, the list shows (6, 1).\n    *   Wait, the enemy body list is: [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)...].\n    *   So (6, 1) is occupied by enemy body.\n    *   So the enemy cannot move UP.\n    *   The enemy can move RIGHT to (7, 0).\n    *   The enemy can move DOWN to (6, -1) -> dies.\n    *   The enemy can move LEFT to (5, 0) -> blocked by own body.\n    *   So the only legal move for the enemy is RIGHT to (7, 0).\n    *   If the enemy is forced to move RIGHT, we don't need to worry about it moving towards us.\n\n    *   Wait, is that true?\n    *   Head at (6, 0). Body at (5, 0).\n    *   Directions:\n        *   UP (6, 1): Body is there. Dead.\n        *   DOWN (6, -1): Off board. Dead.\n        *   LEFT (5, 0): Body is there.

Blocked.\n- **DOWN (6, -1):** Off board. Die.\n- **LEFT (5, 0):** Enemy body is at (5, 0).

Apples are at (2, 0) and (1, 0) nearby.\n- **LEFT (2, 1):** Moves towards the left side. Apples are at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), and (1, 0) nearby.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 1) is generally safer and provides better options than moving to the wall at (3, 0). Being at (2, 1) allows me to pivot to (1, 1) (an apple) next turn, or access the cluster of apples on the left side. Moving DOWN to (3, 0) traps me against the wall, reducing my escape routes if the enemy changes direction later or if I need to dodge. Since the enemy is forced away, taking the more central position (2, 1) is the superior strategic choice.\n\nMove towards the apple cluster on the left side while maintaining board control.\n\nLEFT",

Analyze Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Enemy Head: (8, 0)\n- Enemy Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)]\n- Apples: 8 (Chasing me, need to win).\n\nLet's predict Enemy #0's moves to avoid head-on collisions and use body blocks.\nPossible moves from (8, 0):\n- **UP (8, 1):** Body is at (8, 1). Blocked.\n- **DOWN (8, -1):** Off board. Die.\n- **LEFT (7, 0):** Body is at (7, 0). Blocked.\n- **RIGHT (9, 0):** Board state shows `.` at (9, 0). This is the *only* legal move for the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion on Enemy:** The enemy is forced to move RIGHT to (9, 0).\nThis is crucial. The enemy is moving to the far right corner and will be temporarily trapped or forced to loop. They pose no immediate threat to my left-side position.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation of My Moves:**\nMy goal is to outlast and outscore the enemy. I have 12 apples, they have 8. I need to maintain my lead and stay safe.\n\n- **Option A: UP to (1, 2)**\n    - This moves me toward the top-left apple cluster.\n    - Apples nearby: (2, 2), (1, 2).\n    - Future options: From (1, 2), I can go LEFT to (0, 2), UP to (1, 3), or RIGHT to (2, 2).\n    - Risk: Getting close to the top wall (y=9) can be dangerous later if I get boxed in, but (1, 2) is still low enough to have plenty of room.\n    - *Note:* (2, 2) is an apple. (3, 2) is my body. If I go UP to (1, 2) and eat an apple, my tail does not move this turn, meaning I will grow. Next turn, if I try to go RIGHT to (2, 2), I might hit my own body if it doesn't shift. However, looking at my body chain: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> ... -> (8, 2). If I eat at (1, 2), my body becomes: (1, 2) [Head], (1, 1), (2, 1)... The cell (2, 2) is currently empty (it's an apple, but not my body). Actually, looking at the board `(3, 2)` is `T` (my body). `(2, 2)` is `A` (Apple).\n    - Wait, re-evaluating body collision for moving RIGHT from (1, 2) to (2, 2) next turn: My body will be at (1, 1), (2, 1)... (8, 2). (2, 2) is not in my body list. It is an Apple. So it is safe.\n    - *Wall proximity:* If I go UP, I get closer to the top. If I go LEFT, I stay on the edge.\n\n- **Option B: DOWN to (1, 0)**\n    - This moves me to the bottom wall.\n    - Apples: (1, 0) is an apple.\n    - Future options: From (1, 0), I can only go UP or LEFT (RIGHT is (2, 0), which is an apple, but DOWN is death).\n    - *Risk:* Being at y=0 (bottom) limits my escape routes. If something blocks (0, 0) or (2, 0) later, I could be trapped.\n    - Enemy is at (9, 0), so no collision there.\n    - This is a \"dead end\" move.\n\n- **Option C: LEFT to (0, 1)**\n    - This moves me to the left wall.\n    - Apples: None immediately at (0, 1).\n    - Future options: From (0, 1), I can only go UP or DOWN. LEFT is death.\n    - *Risk:* Like Option B, this traps me against the wall. Wall play is generally higher risk unless necessary to reach a specific apple cluster safely.\n    - *Advantage:* It connects (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) if I weave.\n    - However, moving to the wall usually reduces maneuverability.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nI need to clear the apples on the left side (1,0), (2,0), (1,2), (2,2) to prevent the enemy from getting them (though he's far) and to grow.\nThe enemy is trapped at (9, 0). He has to go to (9, 0) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 2) ... etc, or come back left. He is currently far from me.\nI should prioritize central safety or open space over wall traps.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN vs LEFT:\n- **DOWN (1, 0)** traps me at the bottom wall immediately. Bad for options.\n- **LEFT (0, 1)** traps me at the left wall. Bad for options.\n- **UP (1, 2)** moves me to (1, 2). This leaves me with 3 open exits (Left, Up, Right) and one is my body (Down). It keeps me more central than the walls. It also grabs an apple immediately if (1, 2) has one.\n\nWait, let's check the apple list carefully.\nApples: (1, 2) is in the list.\nSo if I move UP to (1, 2), I will eat an apple. I will grow.\nMy body is currently at (2, 1), (3, 1)... (8, 2).\nIf I eat an apple at (1, 2), my new head is (1, 2). My body becomes (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)...\nThe cell (2, 2) contains an apple. If I want to eat that next turn, I need to check if I can move RIGHT to (2, 2).\n(2, 2) is not in my current body list. It will not be in my body list next turn (my tail stays at (8, 2) because I grew). So (2, 2) will be free.\nTherefore, moving UP sets me up to eat (1, 2) now and (2, 2) next turn.\n\nConclusion:\nUP is the best move. It grabs an apple, avoids walls, and opens up the path to the top-left apple cluster (2, 2), (2, 0) (via drop), (5, 9) (eventually).\nEnemy is forced right to (9, 0), posing no threat to my left-side expansion.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Collision is not an immediate concern for this turn.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Option UP (1, 3):** Moves me up towards the top, opening paths to `(2, 2)` and `(1, 0)` later. Keeps me more central than the edges.\n*   **Option LEFT (0, 2):** Moves me to the wall. While safe now, it limits future options (only up/down). I prefer to avoid walls if possible.\n*   **Option RIGHT (2, 2):** Moves me onto an apple. This is very attractive. It increases my score (currently 13 vs enemy's 8) and grows my body. From `(2, 2)`, I can go to `(3, 2)` (currently my body, but will move next turn), `(2, 3)`, or back `(1, 2)`. It keeps me out of the walls.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n- **RIGHT** gets me an apple immediately and positions me at `(2, 2)`, which is closer to the cluster of apples at `(2, 5)`, `(4, 6)`, and the top right. It also keeps me away from the immediate wall.\n- **UP** moves to `(1, 3)`, which is safe but doesn't yield points immediately and puts me closer to the top wall (y=9).\n\nGiven the priority of \"increase your chance of safely eating apples\" and \"keep future options open\", moving RIGHT to `(2, 2)` to eat the apple is the optimal play. It provides points and maintains central board control.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at `(2, 2)`. From there, I will likely move to `(3, 2)` or `(2, 3)` next turn, depending on the board state. I need to continue increasing my lead over the enemy while being mindful of the dense apple clusters in the upper half of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

My body length is 15 segments (14 apples + initial 1).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n*   **Snake #0:** Head at **(9, 1)**. Body extends to **(8, 0)** and **(5, 0)**. They are in the bottom right.\n*   **Distance:** My head `(2, 2)` is roughly 9 Manhattan distance units away. A head-on collision this turn is impossible.\n*   **Threat:** The enemy has 8 apples. I have 14. I am winning by a margin, but the game is not over. The enemy is contained in a corner-like area, limiting their expansion. I should focus on gathering apples efficiently.\n\n**Board State Assessment:**\nApples are clustered heavily at the top: `(2, 5)`, `(4, 6)`, `(3, 8)`, `(6, 8)`, `(4, 9)`, `(5, 8)`, `(2, 8)`, `(8, 8)`, `(0, 9)`.\nThere are also apples nearby: `(2, 0)` and `(1, 0)` at the bottom, and `(6, 2)` nearby.\n\n**Potential Moves from (2, 2):**\n1.  **UP to (2, 3):** The board shows `T` (Tail).\n    *   **Safety:** My body segment at `(2, 1)` is currently an 'A' in the visual board. Let's trace my body: Head `(2, 2)` -> Neck `(1, 2)` (visual 'T') -> `(1, 1)` (visual 'T') -> `(2, 1)` (visual 'A').\n    *   Wait, the text body list is definitive: `[(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (8, 2)]`.\n    *   The visual board at `(2, 3)` is `T`. This matches the text list: `(3, 3)` is in the list. `(2, 3)` is **not** in the text list.\n    *   Therefore, `(2, 3)` is empty.\n    *   **Verdict: Safe.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 1):** The board shows `A`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(2, 1)` is in my body list.\n    *   **Verdict: Dead.** (Collision with self).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 2):** The board shows `T`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(1, 2)` is my neck.\n    *   **Verdict: Dead.** (Direct backward move).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 2):** The board shows `T`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(3, 2)` is in my body list (position index 7 in the text list).\n    *   **Verdict: Dead.** (Collision with self).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe only safe move is **UP to (2, 3)**.\nChecking `(2, 3)`: It is empty. It is not in my body.\nChecking `(2, 3)` against the enemy body: Enemy is far away.\nChecking `(2, 3)` against the apple list: There is an apple at `(2, 5)` and `(6, 2)`. Moving up brings me closer to the top-center cluster.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\nFrom `(2, 3)`, I can go to `(2, 4)`, `(1, 3)`, or `(3, 3)`.\n*   `(3, 3)` is my body (currently).\n*   `(1, 3)` is empty.\n*   `(2, 4)` is likely empty.\nThis keeps options open.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is only one valid move. All other moves result in immediate death by colliding with my own body. I must move UP.\n\nUP",

Continue up the right column while watching which spaces the enemy vacates, then pick a safe window to move left toward reachable apple clusters (e.g., apples around x6..8) when I have escape routes available.

Not in enemy body. **Safe.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 2):** This is my previous head position. If the tail moves, this opens up, but if not, it's a collision. Let's look at the tail. My tail is at `(8, 2)` (from the body list: `..., (7, 2), (8, 2)`). In the previous move, I moved UP to `(2, 3)`. If I didn't eat an apple, the tail would have moved to `(7, 2)` (shifting from `(8, 2)`). However, I didn't eat an apple in the last move (I moved from `(2, 2)` to `(2, 3)` and there was no apple at `(2, 3)`). Therefore, the tail did not shorten; it just shifted.

Not in my body list (Body starts `(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)...`). `1,3` is safe from my own body. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Board shows `.` (Empty). In my body list? Yes, `... (4, 3), (5, 3) ...`. Wait, let's check the previous list: `..., (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)...`.\n    *   After moving UP, my body shifts. The segment at `(3, 3)` moves to `(3, 2)` (which was previously occupied by `(3, 2)` moving to `(3, 1)`).\n    *   So `(3, 3)` should now be empty (it was the neck of the segment before the neck, which has moved). However, I need to be careful.\n    *   Let's visualize the tail movement.

They are not a threat to me. They have 8 apples. I have 14.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection:**\nI have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize apples and future options.\n*   **Apples:** My current head is (2, 3). Nearby apples:\n    *   (2, 5) - UP\n    *   (6, 2) - To the RIGHT\n    *   (1, 0), (2, 0) - DOWN/LEFT (but DOWN is unsafe)\n    *   Top cluster: (3,8), (4,8), etc.\n*   **UP to (2, 4):** Moves towards (2, 5). Opens up (1, 3) and (3, 3) for next turn.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 3):** Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 9). But moving LEFT takes me away from the central apple (2, 5) and (6, 2). (1, 3) is safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 3):** Moves towards (6, 2). (3, 3) is safe.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMy tail is at (8, 2). The board is 10x10.\nI am in the lower middle. The top row is full of apples (0,9 to 9,9 mostly).\nTo reach the top, I need to navigate up.\nCurrent position (2, 3).\nMoving UP to (2, 4) positions me to grab (2, 5) next.\nFrom (2, 5), I can continue up towards (2, 8) or branch out.\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 3), I go to the left edge. From there, the only way is UP. It's a valid path, but (2, 3) is more central.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 3), I go towards the center-right.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (2, 4) is the most direct path to the nearest apple (2, 5) and keeps me centered. The left path (1, 3) is safe but pushes me to the wall. The right path (3, 3) is safe but shifts me right without immediate gain relative to the (2, 5) apple.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

They are not an immediate threat to my current head position.\n\n**3. Strategic Move Selection:**\nI have 4 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n*   **Goal:** Maximize apples and future options. The game is halfway (turn 28/150). I need to start securing the central area and the top row apples to reach 30.\n*   **Apples:** My current head is (2, 4).\n    *   (2, 5) is an apple. This is directly UP.\n    *   (6, 2) is an apple. This is to the RIGHT/DOWN.\n    *   Top cluster: (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), etc.\n\n*   **UP to (2, 5):** This eats an apple. Eating grows my snake. Growth is crucial to outlasting the enemy. It also keeps me on a vertical line towards the top apples (2, 8) and (2, 9 is empty but connects to the cluster).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 3):** Moves away from the top apples and the immediate apple at (2, 5).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 4):** Moves towards the left edge. (1, 0) and (2, 0) are apples, but going left moves me away from the central cluster (3,8) etc. Also, (1, 4) is empty.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** Moves towards the center. (3, 4) is empty, but (2, 5) is an apple. (3, 4) doesn't provide an immediate point.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **UP** to (2, 5) is the strongest move. It consumes an apple (increasing my score to 15), grows my body (making me harder to kill), and positions me perfectly to continue upward. From (2, 5), I can move UP to (2, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 5), keeping options open towards the top-right cluster where many apples are located (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), etc.).\n\nI will move UP.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\nUP",

That enemy \u201cwall\u201d runs across row 3 (cells (2..7,3)), so heading left puts me adjacent to a hard barrier and risks getting squeezed into a narrow corridor with few safe exits.\n- From (8,3) I\u2019d need to go down to (8,2) then left to approach (6,2). That is possible now but fragile: if the enemy shifts or I get boxed by my own body I could be trapped with limited escape options. Moving left now is higher risk and reduces my future mobility.\n\nAssess UP -> (9,4):\n- (9,4) is free and opens up the entire right column for maneuvering (lots of vertical space).\n- Keeps multiple follow-up options (UP or LEFT later) and avoids getting close to the enemy body cluster on row 3.\n- Gives time to observe enemy movement and choose a safe window to move left toward mid/top apples (e.g., apples around y=6..9).\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Keep moving up the right side to preserve space and options.\n- Watch the enemy\u2019s movements for openings (particularly gaps in their row-3 wall) before cutting left to contest apples.\n- Avoid entering tight corridors near the enemy body until I can guarantee an escape path or until their tail vacates relevant cells.\n\nGiven the above, choose the safer, more flexible move: UP\n\nUP",

The enemy is far away. **Safe.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4):** Board state shows `.` (Empty). My body includes (2, 4)? Let's check. My head was (2, 5). Previous body was [(2, 4), (2, 3)...]. When I moved to (2, 5), the tail (7, 3) was removed. The new body is [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)...]. So (2, 4) is now the second segment of my body. Moving DOWN to (2, 4) is moving into my own body. **Deadly.**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):** Board state shows `.` (Empty). Not in my body. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Board state shows `.` (Empty). Not in my body. **Safe.**\n\n**2. Strategic Move Selection:**\nI must avoid DOWN.\n*   **UP to (2, 6):** This leads into the center of the board. I can see (6, 5) is an apple to the right/up. (4, 6) is also an apple. Moving UP keeps me on the path towards the apple cluster at (3,8) / (4,8) / (5,8).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):** Moves towards the left edge. (1, 0) and (2, 0) are apples. However, I have a large vertical body structure at x=2/3. Going LEFT at (1, 5) is safe but limits future rightward movement because my body blocks (2, 5) and (2, 4). It might trap me on the left side.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Moves towards the center. (3, 5) is empty. From (3, 5), I can access (4, 5) or (3, 6). (6, 5) is an apple.\n\n**Comparison:**\nMy current body forms a long vertical wall on x=2 and x=3 (from y=5 down to y=1).\n*   Moving **UP** allows me to continue vertical expansion and eventually turn right into the top-right cluster (where most apples are: 4,8, 5,8, 3,8, 6,8, 8,8, 4,9, 5,9, 0,9). (2, 6) connects to (2, 7) and (2, 8).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** moves me into the open space but doesn't immediately secure an apple. (3, 5) is safe, but I have to navigate around my own body to reach the top cluster if I go right too early.\n*   Moving **LEFT** risks trapping myself against the wall or my own body.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving UP to reach the top-row apples (specifically (2, 8) and (3, 8) / (4, 8)). The enemy is at (9, 4) and seems to be stuck in the bottom right corner (surrounded by walls and its own body). The primary threat is the board and my own movements.\n\n**Decision:** Move **UP**. It is safe, moves towards the apple cluster, and maintains a path to the top row.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Climb to y=8, targeting the apples at (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), and (5,8). The enemy is trapped in the bottom right and likely to die or be irrelevant. Focus on securing the top row points. Avoid the trap at DOWN.\n\nUP",

Immediate Safety Check (My Head at (2, 6)):**\nMy head is currently at (2, 6) (based on the board state description in the prompt, \"6 . . 1 . A . . . A .\" indicates my head is at (2, 6)). My previous move was UP, moving from (2, 5) to (2, 6). I need to determine the state of adjacent cells for this turn's move.\n*   **UP to (2, 7):** The board state shows (2, 7) is `.` (Empty). My body occupies x=2 from y=6 down to y=0 (and shifts back as I move). Since my head is currently at (2, 6), the segment (2, 6) becomes part of my body immediately upon moving (unless I eat an apple, but there isn't one at (2, 7)). Wait, I must be careful about the body mapping. My head is at (2, 6). The next segment is (2, 5), then (2, 4), etc. If I move UP to (2, 7), my new head is (2, 7). The segment (2, 6) becomes my new neck. Is (2, 7) occupied by my body currently? No, the body list provided starts with (2, 6) as the head. So (2, 7) is not in my current body. **Safe.**\n*   **DOWN to (2, 5):** My current body includes (2, 5) as the immediate segment behind my head. Moving DOWN would move my head back into my own body. **Deadly.**\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):** The board state shows (1, 6) is `.` (Empty). Checking my body: The list starts (2, 6), (2, 5)... (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)... (1, 6) is not in the list. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 6):** The board state shows (3, 6) is `.` (Empty). Checking my body: The list does not contain (3, 6). **Safe.**\n\n**2. Strategic Move Selection:**\nI must avoid DOWN.\n*   **UP to (2, 7):** This moves me vertically up. The board shows apples at (2, 8) and (3, 8). Moving UP puts me one step closer to (2, 8). This maintains the vertical path. However, looking at the board, (2, 8) is an apple, but (2, 7) is empty. If I go UP, I am committing to the column x=2.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 6):** This moves me left. Looking at the board, the left side is relatively open. There are apples at (2, 0), (1, 0) at the bottom, and (0, 9) at the top left. Moving LEFT opens up the possibility to sweep the left side of the board or approach the top-left apple at (0, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 6):** This moves me towards the center. The cluster of apples is mostly at the top right (x=3,4,5,6 at y=8,9). Moving RIGHT moves me horizontally towards that cluster.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   **UP:** Moves towards (2, 8). However, (2, 7) is a \"dead end\" in the sense that if I go UP to (2, 7), my only safe forward move might be (2, 8). From (2, 8), I am trapped unless I eat the apple there and turn. If I eat (2, 8), I grow. But then I am at the top edge (y=8). I would have to turn LEFT to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 8). (3, 8) is an apple. (4, 8) is an apple. This is a viable path, but it forces a turn immediately.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (3, 6). From there, I can go UP to (3, 7). (3, 7) is empty. (3, 8) is an apple. This approach gives me more flexibility. (3, 6) connects to the central area. The enemy snake is at (9, 5) with a tail extending to (6, 0). The enemy is far away, but the board state suggests the enemy is somewhat stuck in the bottom right corner (walls and its own body). My priority is securing apples.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (1, 6). This is safe but moves away from the dense apple cluster at the top right. While (0, 9) is an apple, it is isolated. The top right cluster (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (8,8), (4,9), (5,9) offers a much higher density of points. Ignoring that cluster for a distant apple at (0, 9) seems inefficient for maximizing score before turn 150.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should move **RIGHT** to (3, 6).\nWhy? It positions me centrally to attack the top-right apple cluster. From (3, 6), I can go UP to (3, 7), then UP to (3, 8) (Apple). Alternatively, I can sweep right to (4, 6) or (5, 6) and then go up. Moving UP to (2, 7) feels like walking into a narrow corridor (x=2) where I have a long vertical body below. While I have room to move, the RIGHT move offers more immediate branching paths to the high-value targets.\nThe enemy at (9, 5) is moving. I need to be careful not to trap myself. The board shows the enemy is somewhat contained. I need to grow to win.\nMy body is currently at x=2 mostly. Moving to x=3 opens up the board.\nLet's verify (3, 6) is clear. The board state shows `.` at (3, 6).\nLet's verify (3, 6) is not in my body. My body list: (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3). (3, 6) is not in this list.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT towards the central column to access the top-right apple cluster (3,8), (4,8), etc.). Avoid getting stuck on the edge. Monitor enemy movement to prevent being cut off.\n\nRIGHT",

That route runs parallel to the enemy\u2019s long horizontal wall around y=3 and closer to my own body, which could reduce escape options later.\n- UP preserves the full rightmost column (y increasing) and keeps maximal mobility. From (9,6) I can then go left to contest top/right apples like (8,6) or climb further to y=8\u20139 where many apples are clustered, while staying well clear of the enemy\u2019s dense body for now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move up the right edge to keep options open and avoid being funneled by the enemy\u2019s body.\n- Evaluate enemy movement next turn; if a safe corridor to the cluster at y=8\u20139 opens, cut across to contest those apples.

          "rationale": "Based on the current state at turn 31, I have analyzed the board and potential moves.\n\n**1. Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 6)\n*   **My Body:** The list shows I have a long body, mostly concentrated at x=2 and x=1 in the lower area, and some segments at x=3,4,5 in the y=1-3 range.\n*   **Enemy Snake:** Head at (9, 6). It moved UP to (9, 6) from (9, 5). Its body extends down to (6, 0). It is effectively pinned against the right wall and its own body/tail.\n*   **Apples:** There is a dense cluster at the top right: (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (8,8), (4,9), (5,9). There are also scattered apples, but this cluster is the highest value target.\n*   **Turn History:** My last move was RIGHT from (2, 6) to (3, 6). The turn before that was UP.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from (3, 6)):**\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5):**\n    *   The board state shows (3, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   However, I must check my own body. My body list includes `(3, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, `(5, 3)`, and extends back to `(3, 1)`. While `(3, 5)` is not explicitly listed in the snippet, I need to be careful about the space around (3, 5). More importantly, the board state visualization shows `.` at (3, 5). Given my body occupies `(3, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, and I just came from `(2, 6)`, moving DOWN to `(3, 5)` is likely safe *immediately*, but it leads me deeper into the lower board where I have less space.\n*   **UP to (3, 7):**\n    *   The board shows `(3, 7)` is `.` (Empty).\n    *   My body is not at (3, 7). This move puts me 1 step away from the apple at (3, 8).\n    *   This is the path to the apple cluster.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):**\n    *   The board shows `(2, 6)` is `T` (My body).\n    *   I just moved from (2, 6) to (3, 6). My tail is currently at `(3, 1)` (based on the last element of the body list provided in the previous turn's prompt, which was (5, 3)... wait, the prompt at turn 30 listed the body as ending at `(5, 3)`.\n    *   Let's re-verify my body from the previous prompt: `[(2, 6), (2, 5), ... (4, 3), (5, 3)]`.\n    *   Wait, the prompt at Turn 31 says \"My Snake (ID: 1): ... Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5), ... (5, 3)]\".\n    *   This body list reflects the state *before* my move last turn (Turn 30). I moved RIGHT from (2, 6) to (3, 6).\n    *   So my new head is (3, 6). My new body starts with (2, 6).\n    *   Moving LEFT back to (2, 6) would be moving into my own body (the neck). This is illegal.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n    *   The board shows `(4, 6)` is `.` (Empty).\n    *   My body is at (2, 6), (2, 5), etc. (4, 6) is safe.\n    *   This moves me horizontally towards the apple cluster, but I need to go UP to reach the apples at y=8,9.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Goal:** Reach the apple cluster at the top right (y=8,9) efficiently.\n*   **Path Analysis:**\n    *   From (3, 6), moving **UP** to (3, 7) puts me directly under the apple at (3, 8). From (3, 7), I can eat (3, 8) next turn.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 6) moves me closer to the cluster horizontally, but I would then need two UP moves to reach the apples at (4, 8) or (5, 8).\n*   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (9, 6). They are far away and currently pinned. They are not an immediate threat to my path to the top-left side of the cluster.\n*   **Safety:** (3, 7) is empty and not in my body. (3, 8) is an apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** is the most direct route to the nearest high-value apple (3, 8). It also avoids moving further down into the crowded lower section of the board. Moving RIGHT is viable but slightly less direct for the nearest apple.\n\nLong-term Plan: Secure the apple at (3, 8) on the next turn. Then navigate the top row (y=8, 9) to collect the dense cluster of apples (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), etc.). Watch the enemy snake at (9, 6); if it moves left, it might try to cut me off, but currently, I have the positional advantage towards the central apples.\n\nUP",

Enemy head at (3,6) is too far to threaten these squares this move.\n- LEFT immediately collects the apple at (8,6), growing me and increasing my apples (good \u2014 I'm behind 15 vs 8).\n\nTactical reasoning and short plan:\n- I am trailing on apples and need to take reachable apples whenever safe. LEFT gives an immediate apple and moves me toward the dense cluster in the top-right (more apples at y=8\u20139).\n- Eating now will increase my length; I must avoid getting funneled into my own body along the right edge later. After LEFT, I plan to move upward along x=8 to claim (8,8) and other nearby apples while watching how the enemy approaches. If the enemy heads north toward the same cluster, I will prioritize staying mobile (keeping paths open toward x=9 or leftward escape routes) rather than diving into tight corridors.\n- UP is safe and preserves maximum mobility, but passing up the immediate apple is too costly given the current score deficit.\n\nDecision:\nLEFT",

I need to choose the best direction for Turn 32.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board State:**\n    *   **Head:** (3, 7) (Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (3, 7)\" for the *current* state. The \"My last move information\" section says I moved UP to (3, 6) previously. This is a discrepancy. Let me re-read the prompt carefully.)\n    *   *Re-reading:* \"Turn: 32 / 150\" ... \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (3, 7)\". This means the state provided is the state *after* my previous move (Turn 31) was executed. The \"My last move information\" describes the *decision* made for Turn 31 (which resulted in the current state).\n    *   Therefore, for Turn 32, my head is currently at **(3, 7)**.\n    *   **Body segments:** The list provided is `[(3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), ...]`. This confirms I just moved UP from (3, 6) to (3, 7). The tail is at `(4, 3)`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (8, 6). Body occupies a vertical line at x=9 from y=1 to 6, and then left to (7,0) and (8,0). It is effectively trapped against the wall.\n    *   **Apples:** There is a massive cluster at the top right (y=8, 9). Specifically, (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (8,8) and (4,9), (5,9) are all available.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves from (3, 7):**\n    *   **UP to (3, 8):**\n        *   Location: (3, 8).\n        *   Status: The board state shows `(3, 8)` is `A` (Apple).\n        *   Safety: Is (3, 8) in my body? My body is at `(3, 6), (2, 6), ...` No. Is it in the enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=8,9).\n        *   Outcome: I eat the apple, grow, and score. This is a strong move.\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 6):**\n        *   Location: (3, 6).\n        *   Status: The board state shows `(3, 6)` is `T` (Tail of my snake).\n        *   Rule: Moving into your own body is fatal.\n        *   Outcome: Death.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 7):**\n        *   Location: (2, 7).\n        *   Status: The board state shows `(2, 7)` is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Safety: Check body. My body is at (3, 6), (2, 6)... (2, 7) is empty. Check enemy. Enemy is at x=8,9. Safe.\n        *   Outcome: Safe, but moves away from the apple cluster at (3,8) and (4,8). (2,8) is also an apple, but it is farther from the dense cluster.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n        *   Location: (4, 7).\n        *   Status: The board state shows `(4, 7)` is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Safety: Safe.\n        *   Outcome: Safe, and moves horizontally closer to the cluster. However, UP is the most direct path to the nearest apple.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   **Immediate Reward:** Moving **UP** to (3, 8) secures an apple immediately. With 15 apples, I am 15 away from the win condition (30). I need to close the gap.\n    *   **Pathing:** From (3, 8), I will be adjacent to (4, 8), (5, 8), and (2, 8). This puts me in the heart of the apple cluster.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is pinned at (9,6). It poses no immediate threat to me. It would take many turns for it to navigate around its own body and the wall to reach the center/top.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **UP:** +1 Score, enters the target zone.\n        *   **RIGHT:** No score, steps closer but delays entry into the apple row.\n        *   **LEFT:** No score, steps away from the densest cluster.\n        *   **DOWN:** Death.\n\n    **Conclusion:** Moving UP is the optimal move. It guarantees a point and positions me perfectly to continue clearing the top row apples (3,8 -> 4,8 -> 5,8 -> 6,8 -> ...). I am currently winning (15 vs 9 apples), and accelerating my score is the priority.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the apple at (3,8) on this turn. Then, sweep the top row from left to right (or right to left depending on safe paths) to collect the cluster of apples at y=8 and y=9. Maintain awareness of the enemy snake, but it is currently low priority due to its entrapment.\n\nUP",

The enemy is at y=0..7, but at x=8,9, so it is safe.\n    *   **Value:** Leads me back into the middle of the board, away from the remaining apple cluster at the top (y=9). The distance to (4, 9) or (5, 9) increases from 2 to 3. It is a retreat.\n\n2.  **UP to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (3, 9).\n    *   **Status:** The board shows (3, 9) is `.` (Empty). The nearest apples are at (4, 9) and (2, 8).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves into the top row, keeping me close to the apple cluster. (4, 9) is one step away.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Coordinates:** (2, 8).\n    *   **Status:** The board shows `(2, 8)` is `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Value:** This is an immediate score.

It positions me directly next to the dense apple cluster at (5, 8), (6, 8) and (5, 9).\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** allows me to eat an apple immediately.\nMoving **LEFT** puts me at (2, 8). From there, my next options would likely be to go to (1, 8) or (2, 9) or back to (3, 8). The apple density is slightly lower to the left.\nMoving **RIGHT** puts me at (4, 8). From there, I am adjacent to (5, 8), (6, 8), and (4, 9). This leads directly into the densest part of the cluster.\n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the optimal move. It scores a point and positions me perfectly to sweep the remaining apples at (5, 8), (6, 8), (5, 9), etc.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (4, 8) this turn. Immediately target (5, 8) or (5, 9) next turn to continue the sweep of the top-right apple cluster. The enemy snake is still contained at (8, 7) and poses no threat.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN would be an immediate illegal backward move (death). Eliminate.\n- LEFT -> (7,7): empty and legal. Moves toward the center but is slower to the immediate apple at (8,8). Still safe, but not optimal this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (9,7): empty and legal. However, moving right pushes me further into the right-edge corridor where most of my body already lies, increasing trap risk later. No immediate benefit compared to taking the apple above.\n\nImmediate hazards / collision checks:\n- No enemy head can reach (8,8) this turn, so taking that apple is safe from head-on collisions.\n- My own body blocks DOWN; avoid that.\n- T cells (both snakes' bodies) surround the left and lower areas; taking the apple at (8,8) keeps distance from those tight corridors.\n\nTactical decision:\n- Take the safe immediate apple at (8,8) by going UP. This gains an apple and length, keeps options to sweep the dense apple cluster along y=8\u20139, and avoids funneling into my own tail corridor on the right.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (8,8) now. From there, assess enemy movements; likely plan is to pivot left into the (6\u20135\u20134,8\u20139) apples while preserving an escape route toward x \u2264 7.

The enemy snake (#0) is at (8, 8), with a long body stretching down to (9, 0).\n\n**1. Analyze Immediate Threats:**\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (8, 8). Distance to my head is 4 cells (Euclidean). It cannot reach me next turn.\n- **Self-Collision:** My body follows the path from (4, 8) to (3, 8), (3, 7)... Moving **LEFT** to (3, 8) is the cell directly behind my head. The rules explicitly state: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Therefore, **LEFT is a fatal move**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n- **UP to (4, 9):** Safe. (4, 9) is currently empty (board shows `.`, apple at (4, 9) was eaten in previous turn? Wait, looking at the board state provided, `(4, 9)` is marked as `A` in the grid lines `9 A A . . A A . . . .`. However, checking the apple list: `(4, 9)` is listed. This implies (4, 9) is still an apple. This move scores a point.\n- **DOWN to (4, 7):** Safe. (4, 7) is empty. However, this moves away from the top-right apple cluster where the majority of points remain.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. (5, 8) is an apple (listed in `Apples at` and board grid). This move scores a point and advances towards the densest cluster.\n\n**3. Comparison and Strategy:**\n- **UP** and **RIGHT** are both immediate scoring moves.\n- **RIGHT** (to 5, 8) positions the head immediately adjacent to `(6, 8)`, `(5, 9)`, and `(6, 5)`. This maximizes future mobility and access to the high-density apple zone.\n- **UP** (to 4, 9) scores but is at the top edge of the board. From there, moving to `(5, 9)` or `(3, 9)` are options, but `(3, 9)` is currently empty (board shows `.` at 3,9). The \"Right\" path offers more contiguous apples.\n- **LEFT** is fatal.\n- **DOWN** is safe but yields no score and retreats from the target cluster.\n\n**Decision:**\n**RIGHT** is the optimal move. It guarantees a score increase (moving to 5,8) and positions me to sweep the remaining apples at `(6, 8)`, `(5, 9)`, and `(6, 6)` efficiently. The enemy snake remains distant and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (5, 8). Next turn, target (6, 8) or (5, 9) to continue clearing the top-right cluster. Maintain distance from enemy snake #0.\n\n**START MOVE PICK**\nRIGHT\n**END MOVE PICK**",

If I go to (7,8) this turn, I can take (6,8) next turn \u2014 but the enemy head at (4,8) can go to (5,8) and then both of us can move into (6,8) on the following move. That creates a high risk of a head-on collision that would kill both snakes. Since the enemy currently has many more apples (17 vs 10), a mutual death now would cost me the game. So LEFT is too risky.\n- RIGHT -> (9,8): legal, but pushes me onto the right edge corridor where much of my body already lies. That makes getting boxed in more likely later; it doesn\u2019t give immediate apple gain and reduces future flexibility.\n- UP -> (8,9): legal and keeps multiple escape routes (left or right across row 9). It avoids immediate contest with the enemy for the (6,8)/(5,8) apples and preserves safety while still allowing me to pivot to row 9 apples or approach the cluster more safely later.\n\nGiven the opponent\u2019s likely moves (they can take (4,9) or (5,8) this turn), LEFT risks a direct, fatal head-on over (6,8). RIGHT is passive and potentially self-trapping. UP is the safest move that keeps options open and avoids a dangerous contest that I\u2019m likely to lose.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Move to (8,9) this turn. From there, observe the enemy\u2019s choice:\n  - If enemy goes for (5,8)/(6,8) aggressively, avoid direct clash; instead take row-9 apples (4,9 / 5,9) only if safe, or retreat to open space.\n  - If the enemy moves up to (4,9), I can try to sweep the row-9 apples from the right side while keeping escape routes.\n- Avoid moving into tight corridors (x=9 column) or directly into contested apples that would force a head-on.\n\nUP",

Looking at my body list `[(4, 8), ...]`, this is the cell immediately behind my current head. Moving directly backwards is fatal. **Eliminate LEFT.**\n*   **Direction DOWN:** Moves to (5, 7). This cell is empty on the board and not part of my body or the enemy's body. Safe.\n*   **Direction UP:** Moves to (5, 9). The apple list shows `(5, 9)` is an apple. The board shows `A` at that position. It is not occupied by a snake body. Safe and scores a point.\n*   **Direction RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 8). The apple list shows `(6, 8)` is an apple. It is not occupied by a snake body. Safe and scores a point.\n\n**Strategy & Evaluation:**\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Located at (8, 9) with a body trailing down the right side. It is currently far away and poses no immediate collision threat for the next turn.\n*   **Apple Prioritization:**\n    *   Moving **UP** to (5, 9) allows me to eat an apple and positions me next to apples at (4, 9) and (6, 9). However, (6, 9) is currently empty, and moving to the top edge limits vertical maneuvering.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 8) allows me to eat an apple and positions me adjacent to *three* other apples: (6, 9) is empty, but (5, 9) and (6, 7) are adjacent, and (6, 5) is accessible in two moves. This offers a denser cluster for future turns.\n*   **Outcome:** Both UP and RIGHT are safe and provide immediate points. Moving RIGHT into the denser cluster of apples at (6, 8) is slightly superior for long-term scoring efficiency and board control compared to moving UP to the edge.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (6, 8) to eat the apple and enter the cluster of apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6, 8). Next turn, assess moving to (6, 9) or (5, 9) to continue clearing the top-right apple cluster while maintaining distance from the enemy snake on the right edge.\n\nRIGHT",

The board at `(6, 9)` (row 9, col 6) shows `.` (empty).\n    -   **Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Strategic:** Moves to the top edge. Limited vertical maneuvering in future turns. Adjacent to apples at `(5, 9)` and potentially `(7, 9)`, but `(7, 9)` is the enemy head's current location.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** `(6, 7)`\n    -   **Apple:** No.\n    -   **Collision:** Check board/state. The board at `(6, 7)` (row 7, col 6) shows `.` (empty).\n    -   **Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Strategic:** Moves towards the center/middle rows. Opens up access to apples at `(6, 6)`, `(6, 5)`, `(5, 9)`, `(4, 9)`.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** `(5, 8)`\n    -   **Apple:** Yes (Apple list contains `(5, 9)`? No. Wait, let's check the Apple list again. The list provided in the prompt is: `(2, 0), (1, 0), (5, 9), (6, 2), (4, 9), (2, 8), (4, 6), (0, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (8, 5), (1, 9), (7, 0), (4, 0), (6, 1)`. `(5, 8)` is **not** in the list.\n    -   **Collision:** Check body. My body list starts with `(5, 8)`.\n    -   **Verdict:** **DEADLY**. Moving left hits my own body immediately.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** `(7, 8)`\n    -   **Apple:** No.\n    -   **Collision:** Check enemy body. Enemy body is at `(8, 8)` but not `(7, 8)`.\n    -   **Board Check:** `(7, 8)` is empty on the board (`.`).\n    -   **Strategic:** This moves me closer to the enemy snake. The enemy head is at `(7, 9)`. If I move to `(7, 8)` and the enemy moves `DOWN` to `(7, 8)`, we collide. If the enemy moves `LEFT` to `(6, 9)`, we are adjacent. This is a high-risk area.\n\n**Strategy & Comparison:**\n-   **LEFT** is suicide.\n-   **RIGHT** is risky. It puts my head next to the enemy head. The enemy is at `(7, 9)`. If the enemy moves `DOWN`, we crash. The enemy is likely hunting apples. There is an apple at `(6, 9)` and `(5, 9)`. The enemy might try to get those. Moving to `(7, 8)` doesn't guarantee an apple.\n-   **UP** to `(6, 9)` is safe (empty on board). It doesn't eat an apple (the list shows `(5, 9)` and `(4, 9)` are apples, but `(6, 9)` is not listed).\n-   **DOWN** to `(6, 7)` is safe (empty on board).\n\nLet's re-verify the apple at `(5, 9)`.\nApple list: `(5, 9)` is present.\nMy options to eat `(5, 9)`:\n- Move **LEFT** to `(5, 8)` -> Dies.\n- Move **UP** to `(6, 9)` -> Safe, but does not eat `(5, 9)`.\n- Move **DOWN** to `(6, 7)` -> Safe, but does not eat `(5, 9)`.\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 9: `9 A A . . A A . 0 T .`\nLet's map this to (x, 9):\nx=0: `.` (matches empty)\nx=1: `A` (matches apple `(1, 9)`)\nx=2: `A` (matches apple `(2, 9)`? No, `(2, 9)` is not in the list. Wait, let's look at the list again.\nList: `(5, 9), (4, 9), (0, 9), (1, 9)`.\nThe board shows:\nx=0: `.` (Wait, `(0, 9)` is an apple. The board shows `.` at x=0, row 9? No. Row 9 string: `9 A A . . A A . 0 T .`\nIndices: 0: A, 1: A, 2: ., 3: ., 4: A, 5: A, 6: ., 7: 0, 8: T, 9: .\nSo (0,9) is A? The string shows \"A\" at index 0.\nWait, the coordinate system: (0,0) is bottom left. Row 9 is top.\nThe string for Row 9: `9 A A . . A A . 0 T .`\nx=0: A (Apple? The list has (0,9). Correct.)\nx=1: A (Apple? The list has (1,9). Correct.)\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: A (Apple? The list has (4,9). Correct.)\nx=5: A (Apple? The list has (5,9). Correct.)\nx=6: . (No apple listed for (6,9).)\nx=7: 0 (Enemy Head)\nx=8: T (Enemy Body)\nx=9: .\n\nSo apples at row 9 are at x=0, 1, 4, 5.\n\n**Re-evaluating Moves from (6, 8):**\n-   **LEFT (5, 8):** My body. **Deadly**.\n-   **UP (6, 9):** Empty board cell. No apple. Safe.\n-   **DOWN (6, 7):** Empty board cell. No apple. Safe.\n-   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Empty board cell. No apple. Safe? Risky proximity to Enemy Head at (7, 9).\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n1.  **UP (6, 9):**\n    -   Proximity to apples: Left (5, 9) is an apple. Down (6, 8) is my current position (was an apple, just eaten? No, wait. Last move was RIGHT to (6, 8). Did I eat an apple at (6, 8)? The apple list does *not* contain (6, 8). The board at (6, 8) was `1` (my head). The prompt says \"Apples at: ... (6, 2)...\". Wait, let me check the apple list again.\n    -   Apple List: `(2, 0), (1, 0), (5, 9), (6, 2), (4, 9), (2, 8), (4, 6), (0, 9), (6, 5), (6, 6), (8, 5), (1, 9), (7, 0), (4, 0), (6, 1)`.\n    -   **Crucial:** There is NO apple at (6, 8). My last move rationale said \"Moving RIGHT to (6, 8) allows me to eat an apple\". That was an error in the rationale text provided by the system/user. The apple list provided does not include (6, 8). However, the board state map in the prompt shows `1` at (6, 8). `1` is my ID. It doesn't represent an apple. `A` represents apples.\n    -   Let's check the Board State for row 8: `8 . . A T T T 1 . T .`\n    -   x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: A, x=3: T, x=4: T, x=5: T, x=6: 1, x=7: ., x=8: T, x=9: .\n    -   So (6, 8) is `1`. It is not `A`. So I did not eat an apple at (6, 8).\n    -   Returning to **UP (6, 9)**: Empty. Adjacent to (5, 9) (Apple) and (7, 9) (Enemy). High traffic area.\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):**\n    -   Proximity to apples: (6, 6) is an apple (1 step down). (6, 5) is an apple (2 steps down). (4, 6) is an apple (2 left, 1 down).\n    -   Board row 7: `7 . . . T . . . . T .`\n    -   (6, 7) is `.`. Empty.\n    -   This path seems clear and leads to a cluster of apples at (6, 6), (6, 5), (4, 6).\n\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 8):**\n    -   Proximity to apples: (8, 5) is an apple. (6, 5) is an apple.\n    -   Risk: Enemy Head at (7, 9).\n    -   If I move RIGHT to (7, 8) and Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8), we die.\n    -   If I move RIGHT and Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9), we are adjacent.\n    -   Given the enemy is at (7, 9), and there are apples at (5, 9) and (4, 9) to the left, the enemy is more likely to move LEFT or DOWN.\n    -   However, moving into the column directly below the enemy (x=7) is dangerous.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\n-   **LEFT** is death.\n-   **UP** moves towards the edge and an apple (5, 9) but gets pinned against the wall and close to the enemy (7, 9). If I go UP, I block my escape route down if the enemy comes down.\n-   **RIGHT** moves towards the enemy. High risk of collision if the enemy moves down. The enemy has a long body trailing down the right side. They might turn.\n-   **DOWN** moves into open space, away from the immediate enemy threat, and towards a dense cluster of apples (center-right area). This preserves life and sets up future scoring.\n\n**Choice:** **DOWN**.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 7). From there, I can access the apple cluster at (6, 6), (6, 5), (4, 6) without immediate interference from the enemy snake, which is currently occupying the top-right corner. I will aim to clear the center apples while monitoring the enemy's movement. If the enemy heads down, I can pivot to the left side or the bottom area.\n\nDOWN",

From (6,9) I will have multiple follow-up options (continue left to apples, or right/back toward open space). The main risk is enemy head (6,8) moving UP into (6,9) causing a head-on collision. However, that collision would also kill them, so it's an unlikely preferred move for an opponent with a large lead.\n- DOWN to (7,8) is also empty but is directly adjacent to the enemy head at (6,8). The enemy can move RIGHT into (7,8) and cause a head-on collision. That risk feels slightly higher because the enemy can choose RIGHT (toward me) while still having other safe moves; it also places me closer to my own body on the right (8,8) and reduces safe follow-ups.\n\nDecision and short-term plan\n- Choose LEFT to (6,9). It maximizes safe follow-up moves and moves me toward several reachable apples on the top row. It keeps escape options open (I can sweep left along row 9 or retreat into open central space) and avoids immediately stepping into the pocket near my own body. I accept the small mutual-collision risk because the opponent is unlikely to willingly suicide when they have a big apple lead.\n- If the enemy contests the top row aggressively, avoid head-on fights: prioritize safe collection and escape routes rather than forcing collisions. If the enemy backs off, sweep the remaining row-9 apples and then move down to contest central apples while keeping an eye on their head.\n\nLEFT",

It is now part of my body. **DEADLY**.\n2.  **LEFT (5, 7):** Empty cell `.`.\n    -   Proximity to apples: (4, 6) is close. (2, 8) is an apple, but requires going through (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8). (5, 8) is body, so I can't eat (2, 8) immediately.\n    -   Strategic value: Moves towards the center-left, away from the enemy at (7, 9). Low immediate risk.\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 7):** Empty cell `.`.\n    -   Proximity to apples: (6, 6) is down. (8, 5) is right/down. (6, 5) is down.\n    -   Strategic value: Moves towards the enemy's side (right side), but the enemy is currently at (7, 9). The cell (7, 8) is currently empty (based on previous turn board, enemy was at 7,9). If I move right to (7, 7), I am in the same column as the enemy head (x=7).\n    -   Risk: The enemy is at `(7, 9)`. If they move `DOWN` to `(7, 8)`, we are adjacent but not colliding. If they move `DOWN` again in the future, we could collide. It increases proximity to danger.\n4.  **DOWN (6, 6):** Empty cell `.`.\n    -   **Apple:** YES. The apple list includes `(6, 6)`.\n    -   Proximity: This is the immediate apple.\n    -   Strategic value: Eating an apple grows my tail, which pushes my body out. Moving DOWN to (6, 6) puts me closer to (6, 5) (another apple). This clusters apples and allows efficient clearing.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **UP** is suicide.\n-   **LEFT (5, 7)** and **RIGHT (7, 7)** are safe empty moves.\n-   **DOWN (6, 6)** is a safe apple move.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI am currently at 19 apples. The enemy is at 10 apples. I have a significant lead. The primary goal is survival and scoring.\n-   Moving **DOWN** to eat `(6, 6)` is highly advantageous. It gains a point and increases length (which is generally good for defense and blocking).\n-   From `(6, 6)`, I will be in a prime position to target `(6, 5)` next turn.\n-   Moving **RIGHT** or **LEFT** to empty spaces wastes an opportunity to eat an immediate apple that is directly accessible and safe.\n-   Enemy is far away at `(7, 9)`. Even if they move aggressively towards the center, I have time to secure the bottom center apples.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move **DOWN** to `(6, 6)` to eat the apple.\n2.  If still safe, move **DOWN** to `(6, 5)` next turn to eat that apple.\n3.  Monitor enemy movement. If they descend rapidly, I will pivot left or right.\n\nDOWN",

However, this moves towards the center.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6)**: Currently empty.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 5)**: Contains an apple. Currently empty.\n\n5.  **Strategic Evaluation**:\n    *   Eating is generally good. (6, 5) is an apple.\n    *   Let's look at the board state row 5: `. . T . . . A . A T`\n        *   Index 6 is `A` (Apple at 6,5).\n        *   Index 3 is `T` (My body at 3,5?

The list ends with `(3, 3)`. The list provided in the prompt might be slightly outdated relative to the turn, or I am misinterpreting the board visual.\n    *   Let's rely on the board visual.\n        *   Row 6: `. . T T A . 1 . T T` -> (6,6) is `1`. (5,6) is `A`. (4,6) is `T`. (3,6) is `T`.\n        *   Row 5: `. . T . . . A . A T` -> (6,5) is `A`. (3,5) is `T`.\n    *   So `(5, 6)` is an apple!

T T A . 1 . T T` (Indices 0-9)\n            *   x=4 is `A` (Apple at 4,6).\n            *   x=5 is `.` (Empty at 5,6).\n        *   `5 . . T . . . A .

Enemy tail is long along the right wall.\n        *   If I move **LEFT** to (5, 6), I am moving closer to the vertical wall at x=0? No, x=5 is center.\n        *   If I move **DOWN** to (6, 5), I am moving down.\n        *   Let's look at the \"Apple at\" list again.

Safe (board state confirms).\n        *   **LEFT**: Moves to empty space (5,6). No score.\n        *   **RIGHT**: Moves to empty space (7,6).\n        *   **UP**: Death.\n\n    *   **Why not DOWN?**\n        *   Moving DOWN to (6,5) puts me directly below my current position.\n        *   My body is at (6,7) and (6,8). Moving DOWN creates distance from my body.\n        *   From (6,5), I can easily access (6,4), (5,5), (7,5).\n        *   From (6,5), the apple at (4,6) is 2 steps away (Left, Up). The apple at (7,3) is reachable.\n        *   The apple at (6,5) is confirmed present in the visual `Row 5: . . T . . . A . A T` (x=6).\n\n    *   **Why might LEFT be better?**\n        *   Moving LEFT to (5,6) allows me to eat (4,6) next turn.\n        *   However, (4,6) is *also* an apple I can reach from (6,5) via (5,5)->(4,5)->(4,6) (longer) or (6,5)->(6,6)->(5,6)->(4,6) (but (6,6) is my body after I leave it? No, wait).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (6,5), my body occupies (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)...\n        *   From (6,5), I cannot go back UP to (6,6) because it's my body.\n        *   So from (6,5), the path to (4,6) is: (6,5) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6). That's 3 steps.\n        *   From (5,6) (if I move LEFT now), the path to (4,6) is 1 step.\n\n    *   **Trade-off**: Immediate apple (6,5) vs. Proximity to another apple (4,6).\n    *   Let's check the board state again.\n        *   Row 5: `5 . . T . . . A . A T`\n        *   x=3 is `T`. x=6 is `A`. x=8 is `A`.\n        *   If I move DOWN to (6,5), I eat x=6, y=5.\n        *   If I move LEFT to (5,6), I am at x=5, y=6.\n        *   Row 6: `6 . . T T A . 1 . T T`\n        *   x=4 is `A`. x=5 is `.`.\n        *   So (4,6) is an apple. (5,6) is empty.\n\n    *   **Decision**: Moving DOWN to (6,5) eats an apple.

My body is mostly on the left side of the board, so I have room to maneuver.\nCurrent apples of interest: (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0). These are clustered near my current position.\nThe enemy snake is in the top-left corner. It is far away but blocks a potential path to the top-right apples. I should focus on the bottom-right cluster.\nTo reach (6, 2), I need to go DOWN. This seems safe for this turn.\nMy previous plan was to go DOWN, and the position (6, 4) allows moving DOWN to (6, 3).\nI must check if (6, 3) is safe. (6, 3) is currently empty on the board map (row 3, col 6 is '.').\nHowever, I must also consider the enemy's movement. The enemy is at (3, 9) with a long body. It might move DOWN or RIGHT. If it moves DOWN to (3, 8), that is still far from me. If it moves RIGHT to (4, 9), that is also far.\nI am safe from immediate collision.\nLet's check coordinates.\nHead: (6, 4).\nTarget for next move: (6, 3).\nEnemy likely moves: (3, 9) -> (3, 8) or (4, 9) or (2, 9) or (3, 10 - invalid).\nIf enemy moves to (4, 9), distance is large.\nMy body is at (6, 5), (6, 6)... so (6, 3) is not my body (except the tail which is far away).\nWait, let's look at my body again.\nMy body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2)].\nThe head is (6, 4).\nMoving DOWN to (6, 3).\nIs (6, 3) in my body? No. My body is mostly x=2-6, y=1-8, but specifically (6,3) is not listed.\nIs (6, 3) on the board? Yes (0-9).\nIs (6, 3) occupied by enemy? No, enemy is at x=3-9, y=9 (mostly), head (3,9).\nSo (6, 3) is safe.\nWhy move DOWN?\n1. To reach (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0). These are 3 apples right below me.\n2. The board map shows (6, 3) is empty '.'.\n3. The enemy is far.\n4. Moving UP to (6, 5) is my own body (the segment immediately behind head).\n5. Moving LEFT to (5, 4). Is (5, 4) safe? Looking at board map row 4: `... 4 . . T . . . 1 . . T`. (5, 4) is '.' (empty). Wait, the text says `... 4 . . T . . . 1 . . T`. Let's map it:\n   4 . . T . . . 1 . . T\n   Col 0: .\n   Col 1: .\n   Col 2: T (This is (2,4)? No, wait. My body is at (2,4) and (2,5) etc. Wait, let's look at the board map provided.\n   `4 . . T . . . 1 . . T`\n   Col 0: .\n   Col 1: .\n   Col 2: T\n   Col 3: .\n   Col 4: .\n   Col 5: .\n   Col 6: 1 (My head)\n   Col 7: .\n   Col 8: .\n   Col 9: T\n   So (5, 4) is Col 5, which is '.'.\n   (4, 4) is Col 4, which is '.'.\n   (3, 4) is Col 3, which is '.'.\n   (2, 4) is Col 2, which is 'T'. My body is at (2, 4).\n   \n   So LEFT to (5, 4) seems safe.\n   DOWN to (6, 3) seems safe.\n   RIGHT to (7, 3). Board map row 3: `3 . . T . A . . A . T`.\n   Col 7 is '.'. So (7, 3) is safe.\n   \n   I want to get to the bottom apples.\n   Path A: DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN. (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (6,0). This is a clear vertical path.\n   Path B: LEFT -> LEFT -> DOWN -> ... to reach (5,0) or (4,0).\n   Path C: RIGHT -> ... to (7,0).\n   \n   Path A seems most direct and I can start it now.\n   Checking for traps:\n   If I go DOWN to (6,3), can I leave?\n   From (6,3), I can go DOWN to (6,2) (Apple? No, (6,2) is apple. Wait, apples list includes (6,2)). Yes, I can eat it.\n   If I go DOWN to (6,3), I have occupied (6,4) and (6,5) etc.\n   My tail will move from (3,2) to (4,2) or something? Wait, the last segment is (3,2).\n   If I move DOWN, I eat (6,2)? No, I move to (6,3). I need to move DOWN again to get to (6,2).\n   Let's trace the tail.\n   Current body length is 22 (Head + 21 body parts).\n   If I move DOWN to (6,3):\n   New head (6,3).\n   Old head (6,4) becomes neck.\n   Old body (6,5)... (3,2).\n   If I eat an apple, I grow. I don't eat an apple at (6,3).\n   So the tail moves forward. The tail is currently at (3,2).\n   The segment before tail is (4,2).\n   So tail moves to (4,2).\n   \n   Is there any risk of self-collision?\n   If I go DOWN to (6,3), I am moving towards (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n   My body is at (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8)...\n   Wait, my body has a vertical segment at x=6, y=5 to 8.\n   (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n   If I go DOWN, I am at (6,3). The body above me is (6,4) (becoming neck), (6,5).\n   I am moving away from the body at y=5,6,7,8.\n   So no self-collision.\n   \n   What about enemy collision?\n   Enemy is at (3,9).\n   If enemy moves DOWN to (3,8), it hits my body (3,8)? My body is at (3,8)? Yes.\n   My body: (3,8) is the 7th element.\n   So if Enemy moves DOWN to (3,8), Enemy dies.\n   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (4,9), it hits my body? (4,9) is not in my body. My body at y=8 is (4,8). (4,9) is empty?\n   Board map row 9: `9 A A . 0 T T T T T .`.\n   (4,9) is '.' (Col 4).\n   So Enemy moving RIGHT is safe for Enemy.\n   Enemy moving LEFT to (2,9) is 'A' (Apple).\n   Enemy moving DOWN to (3,8) is risky for Enemy (hits my body).\n   Enemy is at 12 apples. I am at 21.\n   Enemy might be aggressive but likely wants to survive.\n   Given the distance, it's unlikely Enemy reaches me this turn.\n   My priority is to grab the apples at the bottom.\n   \n   Let's evaluate the DOWN move again.\n   Destination: (6, 3).\n   Check board map: Row 3, Col 6 is '.'.\n   Check body: (6, 3) is not in my body.\n   Check enemy body: Enemy body is x=3-9, y=9 (mostly), head (3,9). (6,3) is far.\n   Check enemy head: (3,9). Distance is large.\n   Check out of bounds: No.\n   \n   Alternative: LEFT to (5, 4).\n   (5, 4) is '.'.\n   This moves me towards the left side apples (4,0) etc.\n   But I am currently at (6, 4). The vertical line at x=6 has apples at (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n   It is much faster to take those 3 apples by going DOWN 3 times.\n   If I go LEFT, I have to navigate around (5, 0) etc.\n   The vertical path DOWN is clear.\n   \n   Wait, look at row 2: `2 . T T T T . A . . .`\n   (6, 2) is 'A'. (Col 6).\n   (5, 2) is 'T'. (Col 5).\n   (4, 2) is 'T'. (Col 4).\n   (3, 2) is 'T'. (Col 3).\n   (2, 2) is 'T'. (Col 2).\n   (1, 2) is 'T'. (Col 1).\n   (0, 2) is '.' (Col 0).\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3), then DOWN to (6, 2) (Apple), then I am at (6, 2).\n   From (6, 2), I need to get to (6, 1).\n   Is (6, 1) safe?\n   Row 1: `1 . T T T T . A . . .`\n   (6, 1) is 'A'. (Col 6).\n   Is it blocked? No.\n   Then (6, 0).\n   Row 0: `0 . A A . A A A A . .`\n   (6, 0) is 'A'.\n   \n   So the vertical path is clear of obstacles (except apples).\n   My body will follow.\n   At (6, 2), I will have eaten 1 apple. My body will be longer.\n   The body currently extends to (3, 2).\n   When I am at (6, 2), my tail might be at (4, 2)?\n   Let's trace:\n   Start: Head (6,4). Tail (3,2).\n   Move 1: Head (6,3). Tail (4,2).\n   Move 2: Head (6,2) (Eat). Tail (5,2) or moves forward?\n   Wait, if I eat, I don't shrink.\n   So after Move 1: Head (6,3). Tail (4,2).\n   After Move 2: Head (6,2). Tail stays at (4,2) (grow by 1).\n   Wait, if I don't eat, tail moves to (5,2).\n   If I eat, tail stays (5,2)? No.\n   Current body length L.\n   Move to empty: Head new, Tail old-1.\n   Move to Apple: Head new (Apple), Tail old.\n   \n   Let's check (5, 2) and (4, 2).\n   (5, 2) is 'T' on the board map. It is currently occupied by my body?\n   My body list: (2, 5), (2, 4), ... (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n   Wait, my body list ends with ... (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n   So (3, 2) is the tail.\n   (4, 2) is the segment before tail.\n   (5, 2) is NOT in my body list provided.\n   Wait, let's look at the board map again.\n   `2 . T T T T . A . . .`\n   (2, 2) is 'T'.\n   (3, 2) is 'T'.\n   (4, 2) is 'T'.\n   (5, 2) is 'T'.\n   (6, 2) is 'A'.\n   \n   Wait, my body list provided:\n   ... (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n   This is the end of the list.\n   (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2).\n   So (4, 2) and (3, 2) are my body.\n   What about (5, 2)? It is 'T' on the map, but not in my list?\n   Ah, maybe the map is just a visual representation of the current turn, and 'T' means any snake body part? No, usually 'T' is just a visual for 'something is there'.\n   Actually, in the prompt: `T` is used in the board state.\n   Looking at the board state description:\n   `Board state: ...`\n   It seems `T` represents the body of the snake? Or maybe just an obstacle?\n   Let's look at the Enemy snake body: (4,9), (5,9)... (9,3).\n   On the board: `9 A A . 0 T T T T T .`\n   (4,9) is 'T', (5,9) is 'T', etc.\n   So 'T' means snake body (my or enemy).\n   \n   So if (5, 2) is 'T', it is occupied.\n   Is it occupied by ME or ENEMY?\n   My body ends at (3, 2).\n   Enemy body is mostly y=9.\n   Is there any part of my body at (5, 2)?\n   The list provided: ... (6, 5), (6, 6) ...\n   Let's look at the full list again.\n   `Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2)]`\n   This list has 21 segments.\n   It does NOT include (5, 2).\n   It includes (2, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n   But NOT (5, 2).\n   However, the board state shows (5, 2) as 'T'.\n   This is a contradiction or I am missing something.\n   Maybe the board state includes 'T' for walls or something?\n   No, \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\".\n   Maybe the 'T's on the board are the enemy snake? Or maybe the board state is slightly off or I'm misreading the map.\n   \n   Let's re-read the board state carefully.\n   `9 A A . 0 T T T T T .` (Enemy head is (3,9) -> '0'. Body (4,9)-(8,9) -> 'T's.)\n   `8 . . A T T T T . T .` (My body (6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (3,8) -> 'T's. Enemy body (8,8) -> 'T'.)\n   `7 . . . T . . T . T .` (My body (3,7) -> 'T'. Enemy (8,7) -> 'T'.)\n   `6 . . T T A . T . T T` (My body (3,6), (2,6) -> 'T'. Enemy (8,6), (9,6) -> 'T'.)\n   `5 . . T . . . T . A T` (My body (2,5) -> 'T'. Enemy (9,5) -> 'T'.)\n   `4 . . T . . . 1 . . T` (My body (2,4) -> 'T'. Enemy (9,4) -> 'T'.)\n   `3 . . T . A . . A . T` (My body (2,3) -> 'T'. Enemy (9,3) -> 'T'.)\n   `2 . T T T T . A . . .` (My body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> 'T's. Wait, (5,2) is also 'T'. Is (5,2) my body? No, my list ends at (3,2). Is it Enemy? No, Enemy is at y=9-3. Is it a new snake? No. Is it an apple? No, apples are listed. Maybe (5,2) is just 'T' for something else?\n   \n   Wait, `2 . T T T T . A . . .`\n   (1,2) is 'T'.\n   (2,2) is 'T'.\n   (3,2) is 'T'.\n   (4,2) is 'T'.\n   (5,2) is 'T'.\n   (6,2) is 'A'.\n   \n   My body: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).\n   Who is at (5,2)?\n   Maybe the 'T' on the board is just a visual representation of where my body *was* or is generic.\n   But the prompt says: `Think very hard and consider where your body and the enemy snake body are.`\n   And provides the exact coordinates.\n   If the provided coordinates don't list (5,2), then (5,2) is NOT my body.\n   If the board state shows 'T' at (5,2), it might be an error in the board state visualization, or it represents something else.\n   Or, am I looking at the coordinates wrong?\n   `X,Y`. `X` is horizontal. `Y` is vertical.\n   Row 2 (Y=2) has `(5,2)` as `T`.\n   \n   Let's assume the provided coordinate list is the ground truth.\n   My body: ... (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2).\n   So (5, 2) is NOT in my body.\n   Is (5, 2) in enemy body? No.\n   Is (5, 2) an apple? No.\n   So (5, 2) is EMPTY.\n   The 'T' on the board might be a mistake or just a visual artifact. I should trust the coordinate list.\n   \n   If (5, 2) is empty, then (6, 2) is empty (apple).\n   (6, 3) is empty.\n   \n   So the path DOWN is valid.\n   However, I should consider the immediate threat.\n   My head is (6, 4).\n   Enemy head is (3, 9).\n   Enemy moves. Where can it go?\n   It can go DOWN (3,8), LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9), UP (3,10 - invalid).\n   (3,8) is my body. Enemy dies if it goes there.\n   (2,9) is apple 'A'.\n   (4,9) is empty '.'.\n   \n   If Enemy goes to (4, 9), it is safe.\n   If Enemy goes to (2, 9), it eats apple.\n   The distance between me and enemy is large (Manhattan distance ~9).\n   So I am safe from immediate head-on collision.\n   \n   I am moving DOWN to (6, 3).\n   This is a safe move.\n   It puts me closer to 3 apples.\n   \n   Is there a better move?\n   If I move LEFT to (5, 4):\n   (5, 4) is empty.\n   This moves me towards (4, 0) etc.\n   But I am leaving 3 apples directly below me.\n   \n   If I move RIGHT to (7, 3):\n   (7, 3) is empty.\n   There is an apple at (7, 3)? No, apples are (2,0)... (7,0), (7,3) is empty on the list.\n   Apples: (2, 0), (1, 0), (6, 2), (2, 8), (4, 6), (0, 9), (8, 5), (1, 9), (7, 0), (4, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 3) - Wait, (7, 3) IS in the apple list!\n   `Apples at: (2, 0), (1, 0), (6, 2), (2, 8), (4, 6), (0, 9), (8, 5), (1, 9), (7, 0), (4, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 3), (5, 0), (4, 3)`\n   Yes, (7, 3) is an apple.\n   \n   So my options:\n   1. DOWN to (6, 3) -> Next move (6, 2) (Apple).\n   2. LEFT to (5, 4) -> Next move ... (4, 0) or (5, 0).\n   3. RIGHT to (7, 3) -> Eat Apple immediately? No, I move *to* (7, 3). If I move there, I eat it.\n   \n   Wait, if I move RIGHT to (7, 3), I EAT an apple immediately.\n   Moving DOWN to (6, 3) does NOT eat an apple immediately.\n   However, (6, 2) is an apple.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7, 3):\n   I eat (7, 3).\n   My head becomes (7, 3).\n   My body grows. Tail stays at (3, 2).\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3):\n   I don't eat.\n   Head becomes (6, 3).\n   Tail moves to (4, 2).\n   \n   Which is better?\n   Eating an apple is good. It gives me a point and growth.\n   But I am looking at the cluster of apples at the bottom right.\n   (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0).\n   If I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I am at (7, 3).\n   From (7, 3), I can go DOWN to (7, 2) (Empty), (7, 1) (Empty?), (7, 0) (Apple).\n   Or LEFT to (6, 3) -> (6, 2).\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3):\n   Next: (6, 2) (Apple). Eat.\n   Next: (6, 1) (Apple). Eat.\n   Next: (6, 0) (Apple). Eat.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7, 3):\n   I eat (7, 3).\n   Next: (7, 2).\n   Next: (7, 1).\n   Next: (7, 0) (Apple). Eat.\n   Next: (6, 0) (Apple). Eat.\n   \n   Path DOWN seems to have 3 apples in a row very quickly.\n   Path RIGHT has 1 immediate apple, then a clear path to (7, 0), but (7, 2) and (7, 1) are empty.\n   \n   However, look at the board state for row 2 and 1.\n   Row 2: `(5, 2)` is 'T' on map. If I trust the map, (5, 2) is blocked.\n   If (5, 2) is blocked, then moving DOWN to (6, 3) -> (6, 2) is good.\n   But if I am at (6, 2) and want to go to (6, 1), I can.\n   But if I want to go LEFT from (6, 2) to (5, 2), it is blocked (by 'T').\n   So I am funneled into the right edge or bottom edge.\n   \n   Let's re-evaluate the 'T' at (5, 2).\n   My body coordinates: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2).\n   (5, 2) is not in this list.\n   Maybe (5, 2) is part of the Enemy? No.\n   Maybe it's a wall?\n   The prompt says `Board size is 10x10`.\n   It seems (5, 2) is occupied.\n   \n   If (5, 2) is occupied, then from (6, 3), I can go DOWN to (6, 2). I cannot go LEFT to (5, 3)? (5, 3) is empty on map.\n   (5, 3) is empty.\n   \n   Okay, let's stick to the plan.\n   I need to decide between DOWN and RIGHT.\n   DOWN moves me closer to the (6,2)-(6,0) cluster.\n   RIGHT moves me to an immediate apple (7, 3) but away from the (6,2) cluster.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT, I get +1 score immediately.\n   If I go DOWN, I have to wait 1 turn to get +1 (at 6,2).\n   But I will get 3 apples quickly going DOWN.\n   If I go RIGHT, I have to navigate down and then left.\n   Path RIGHT: (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) -> (7,0) -> (6,0).\n   Path DOWN: (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (6,0).\n   \n   Path DOWN allows eating (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n   Path RIGHT allows eating (7,3), (7,0), (6,0).\n   (7,0) is an apple.\n   (4,0) and (5,0) are also apples.\n   \n   Let's check safety.\n   Enemy at (3,9). Distance to (6,3) is huge.\n   Enemy at (3,9). Distance to (7,3) is huge.\n   \n   Let's check the map again for row 3 and 4.\n   Row 3: `3 . . T . A . . A . T`\n   (5, 3) is 'A' (Apple). Wait, (5, 3) is 'A'?\n   Col 0: .\n   Col 1: .\n   Col 2: T\n   Col 3: .\n   Col 4: A\n   Col 5: .\n   Col 6: .\n   Col 7: A\n   Col 8: .\n   Col 9: T\n   \n   So (5, 3) is '.' (Col 5).\n   (4, 3) is 'A'. (Col 4).\n   (7, 3) is 'A'. (Col 7).\n   \n   Wait, apples list includes (4, 3) and (7, 3).\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7, 3), I eat (7, 3).\n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3), I am at (6, 3). (4, 3) is an apple to my left, but blocked by (5, 3)?\n   (5, 3) is empty.\n   \n   Let's consider the immediate move.\n   I am at (6, 4).\n   I can go DOWN to (6, 3).\n   I can go LEFT to (5, 4).\n   I can go RIGHT to (7, 4)? No, (7, 4) is empty?\n   Row 4: `4 . . T . . . 1 . . T`\n   (7, 4) is '.'.\n   \n   Wait, I missed (6, 4) -> (5, 4) is an option.\n   (5, 4) is empty.\n   From (5, 4), I can go DOWN to (5, 3) (Empty), (5, 2) (T - Blocked?).\n   If (5, 2) is blocked, I shouldn't go to (5, 4) if I plan to go down the middle.\n   The path DOWN (x=6) is clear: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n   The path LEFT (x=5) is blocked at (5,2) by 'T'.\n   So the only way to get to the bottom apples safely is via x=6 or x=7 (or x=8/9 but those are enemy territory).\n   \n   So I am forced to stay at x=6 or x=7.\n   \n   Option A: DOWN to (6, 3).\n   Option B: RIGHT to (7, 3) (Eat Apple).\n   \n   If I go to (7, 3), I eat an apple.\n   Then I can go DOWN to (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0) (Apple).\n   Then I can go LEFT to (6, 0) (Apple).\n   This path is also good.\n   \n   But look at (6, 2). It is an apple.\n   If I go DOWN, I can get (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0).\n   If I go RIGHT, I get (7, 3), (7, 0), (6, 0).\n   (7, 0) is an apple.\n   (4, 0) is an apple. Can I reach (4, 0)?\n   If I am at (6, 0), I can go LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple), (4, 0) (Apple).\n   Is (5, 0) safe?\n   Row 0: `0 . A A . A A A A . .`\n   (5, 0) is 'A'.\n   (4, 0) is 'A'.\n   (3, 0) is '.'.\n   (2, 0) is 'A'.\n   \n   So both paths allow reaching the bottom apples.\n   \n   However, (7, 3) is an immediate apple.\n   (6, 3) is empty.\n   (6, 2) is an apple (one move away).\n   (6, 1) is an apple (two moves away).\n   (6, 0) is an apple (three moves away).\n   \n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3):\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (6, 2) (Eat).\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (6, 1) (Eat).\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (6, 0) (Eat).\n   Total gain: 3 apples. Cost: 3 turns.\n   \n   If I go RIGHT to (7, 3):\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (7, 2).\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (7, 1).\n   Next turn I go DOWN to (7, 0) (Eat).\n   Next turn I go LEFT to (6, 0) (Eat).\n   Total gain: 2 apples. Cost: 4 turns.\n   \n   Wait, (6, 1) and (6, 2) are very close.\n   Why is the score 21 vs 12?\n   I am winning. I should secure apples.\n   \n   Is there any risk to going DOWN?\n   (6, 3) is safe.\n   Is there any risk from the enemy?\n   The enemy is at (3, 9).\n   The enemy might want to come down.\n   If the enemy comes down, it will hit my body at (3, 8) or (3, 7).\n   So if the enemy wants to kill itself, it can.\n   But usually, they survive.\n   If the enemy moves down to (3, 8) (hits my body), it dies. I win immediately.\n   But the enemy won't do that.\n   The enemy will likely stay at top or go for apples there.\n   Apples at top: (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9).\n   The enemy is at (3, 9). It can go to (2, 9), (4, 9), (3, 8).\n   (3, 8) is my body.\n   (2, 9) is apple.\n   (4, 9) is empty.\n   \n   If the enemy goes to (2, 9), it eats an apple.\n   If the enemy goes to (4, 9), it is safe.\n   \n   I am safe to move DOWN.\n   \n   Let's check the turn count. 40 / 150.\n   Plenty of time.\n   \n   I will choose DOWN.\n   Rationale:\n   1. Moves towards the dense cluster of apples (6,2), (6,1), (6,0).\n   2. The path is clear of obstacles (based on my body list and board map).\n   3. Enemy is far away and no immediate threat of collision.\n   4. Moving RIGHT is good (eating 7,3) but moving DOWN sets up a chain of 3 apples.\n   \n   One detail: (6, 3) is safe.\n   Check (6, 3) again.\n   Board map row 3: `... A . . A . T` -> (6, 3) is `.`.\n   My body: No.\n   Enemy body: No.\n   \n   So DOWN is the optimal move to reach the cluster.\n\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Safe? My body extends from (6, 3) downwards to (6, 8) and left to (4, 8). The segment immediately below my head is (6, 3). Moving UP would place my new head at (6, 3), which is currently occupied by my *future* neck. Since I am currently at (6, 2), the segment at (6, 3) will move down to (6, 2) (becoming my new neck). Wait, if I move UP, my head goes to (6, 3). My body currently has (6, 3) as the second segment. When I move, the tail moves off, and the body shifts. The segment at (6, 3) will effectively be \"under\" my new head if I don't grow. However, if I don't hit an apple, the tail (4, 2) moves. The list will shift. (6, 3) is the next cell in the chain. If I move into (6, 3), I am moving into the cell that is currently occupied by my own body. **This is a collision. I die.**\n- **DOWN to (6, 1):** Empty. Safe from my own body (my body is at (6, 3) and above, or to the left). My current tail is (4, 2). (6, 1) is clear. Is it an apple? Yes, (6, 1) is an apple. Eating it increases score and length. Safe from enemy? Enemy is at (1, 9). Far away.\n- **LEFT to (5, 2):** Empty. Safe from my own body? My body occupies (6, 3) -> ... -> (4, 2). (5, 2) is adjacent to (6, 2) and (4, 2). (4, 2) is currently occupied by the tail. When I move, the tail moves. However, (5, 2) is currently empty on the board state. It is not part of my current body list. Wait, let's re-verify my body list: [(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]. (5, 2) is not in this list. It is an empty square. Moving LEFT is safe.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Empty. Safe from my own body. (7, 2) is not in my body list. It is an empty square. Moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Comparison of safe moves:**\n1.  **DOWN (6, 1):** Hits an apple. Increases score. Keeps me moving towards the cluster (6, 0) and (7, 0). My body is long and blocking the left side, so moving right/down is better to open up space.\n2.  **LEFT (5, 2):** Opens up the left side, but I am already surrounded by my own body to the left. Moving left might trap me against the wall or my own body loop.\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** Opens up the right side. Good option if DOWN wasn't an apple. But DOWN *is* an apple.\n\n**Decision:** Moving DOWN is the optimal move because it secures an immediate point and moves me closer to the next apple in the cluster ((6, 0)). It avoids the risk of moving LEFT into a potentially tighter space or RIGHT where there are fewer immediate apples compared to the vertical line at x=6.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Collect the vertical apples at (6, 1) and (6, 0). Then move to (7, 0) or (5, 0) depending on the state. Keep an eye on the enemy snake at (1, 9); they are moving down but are blocked by the wall and my body at (3, 8) if they try to go straight down. I have a significant score lead (22 vs 13), so survival is key.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy head (6,2) is far away, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\nAnalysis:\n- LEFT gets a guaranteed apple now (growth +1). It moves me into the top-left corner, which reduces immediate options next turn (only DOWN will be available after that), but that is acceptable because (0,8) is empty and gives an escape route.\n- DOWN is safer in terms of options (after moving to (1,8) I would have multiple exits) but misses the immediate apple at (0,9).\n- The enemy is concentrated around column x=6 and the mid/low board; they are not an immediate threat to the top-left corner. I should avoid getting funneled into narrow traps later; taking the corner apple now and then descending the left column (watching for enemy approach) is a reasonable short-term plan.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Take (0,9) now, then move DOWN along the left edge to (0,8) etc., keeping an eye on the enemy head and open escape squares.

However, it leads to the bottom edge of the board.\n    -   **Future Risk:** If I move to (6, 0), my new body will occupy (6, 1) and above. My head will be at (6, 0). From there, my only safe moves on the next turn would likely be LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0). If I am not careful, I could box myself in. Specifically, moving DOWN might force me to traverse along the bottom edge, which can be a trap if the enemy or board geometry cuts off escape. However, I must eat apples to win, and (6, 0) is a guaranteed point.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (6, 1) -> (5, 1).\n    -   **Status:** SAFE.\n    -   **Analysis:** (5, 1) is empty. This moves me toward the cluster of apples at the bottom left (5, 0), (4, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0).\n    -   **Future Risk:** The bottom left is a crowded area with my body segments nearby at (4, 1) and (4, 2). Moving LEFT to (5, 1) is a defensive move that keeps me away from the bottom edge temporarily.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (7, 1) -> (7, 0) or (7, 2).\n    -   Wait, looking at the coordinates. My head is (6, 1).\n    -   RIGHT would be (7, 1).\n    -   **Status:** SAFE (currently).\n    -   **Analysis:** (7, 1) is empty. It is close to apples at (7, 0) and (7, 3).\n    -   **Future Risk:** Moving to (7, 1) positions me on a column that is relatively open (7, 0, 7, 1 are clear).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have a score of 23 vs 14. I am winning.\nThe bottom row (y=0) is filled with apples: (0,0) to (9,0) has apples at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nMy head is at (6, 1). The apple at (6, 0) is directly below.\nEating (6, 0) is valuable because it prevents the enemy (who is currently far away) from getting it easily later. However, I must be careful not to get trapped at the bottom.\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0):\n- Next turn, I can go LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple) or RIGHT to (7, 0) (Apple).\n- My body will be blocking (6, 1).\n- This creates a \"sweeping\" motion along the bottom.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 1):\n- I can eat (5, 0) next turn.\n- This avoids the immediate bottom edge.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 1):\n- I can eat (7, 0) or (7, 3) next turn.\n\n**Comparison:**\nThe apple at (6, 0) is the closest and \"cleanest\" target. It is a straight line from my current approach.\nMoving LEFT to (5, 1) is also good, but it puts me adjacent to my own body at (4, 1) and (4, 2), which might limit options later.\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 1) is open, but (6, 0) is a distinct target.\n\nLet's look at the enemy. Snake #0 is at (0, 9). They are very far away. They cannot threaten me for many turns. I should focus on maximizing my score safely.\n\n**Re-evaluating DOWN to (6, 0):**\nAt Turn 44, I would be at (6, 0).\nBody: [(6, 1), (6, 2), ... (4, 2)]\nFrom (6, 0), valid moves:\n- UP: (6, 1) -> Safe (My body is there, but it moves? No, moving UP into (6, 1) is moving into my current body's neck. Actually, if I move DOWN now, next turn (6, 1) is the body segment immediately behind my head. Moving UP into it would be suicide).\n- LEFT: (5, 0) -> Apple. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7, 0) -> Apple. Safe.\n- DOWN: (6, -1) -> Death (Wall).\n\nSo if I go DOWN to (6, 0), I will have 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT and RIGHT).\nThis is acceptable.\n\n**Re-evaluating LEFT to (5, 1):**\nAt Turn 44, I would be at (5, 1).\nBody: [(6, 1), (6, 2), ... (4, 2)]\nFrom (5, 1), valid moves:\n- UP: (5, 2) -> Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (5, 0) -> Apple. Safe.\n- LEFT: (4, 1) -> Occupied by my body (2nd to last segment). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6, 1) -> Occupied by my neck. Unsafe.\n\nSo from (5, 1), I have 2 safe moves (UP and DOWN).\nThis is also acceptable.\n\n**Re-evaluating RIGHT to (7, 1):**\nAt Turn 44, I would be at (7, 1).\nBody: [(6, 1), (6, 2), ... (4, 2)]\nFrom (7, 1), valid moves:\n- UP: (7, 2) -> Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (7, 0) -> Apple. Safe.\n- LEFT: (6, 1) -> Neck. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (8, 1) -> Empty. Safe.\n\nFrom (7, 1), I have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\nThis offers the most flexibility.\n\n**Comparison of Flexibility:**\n- DOWN (6, 0): 2 options (Left, Right).\n- LEFT (5, 1): 2 options (Up, Down).\n- RIGHT (7, 1): 3 options (Up, Down, Right).\n\n**Safety Check - Enemy Collision:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (0, 9). It moves simultaneously.\nIt is trapped by the wall at x=0 and my body at x=3..9 at y=9. It must move DOWN to (0, 8) or (1, 8) (if it turns).\nIt is nowhere near me (y=9 vs y=1). No collision risk.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to eat apples. (6, 0) is an apple.\n(5, 0) is an apple.\n(7, 0) is an apple.\n(7, 3) is an apple.\n(5, 2) is empty.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 1) sets up a sweep of the bottom right area. It is safe and offers high flexibility.\nMoving DOWN to (6, 0) eats an apple immediately but restricts my next move slightly more than (7, 1) would.\nHowever, eating an apple is the objective.\nLet's look at the board again.\n(6, 0) is an apple.\n(7, 0) is an apple.\n(6, 1) is an apple (currently, but I am standing on it? No, I am at (6, 1). The apple list shows (6, 1) as an apple. Wait.\n**Correction:** My head is at (6, 1). The apples list includes (6, 1).\nI am currently standing on an apple and haven't eaten it yet? No, the game mechanics imply that apples are on the board, and moving onto them consumes them. If I am at (6, 1), and (6, 1) is an apple, I should have eaten it last turn or it's a display artifact. Let's assume the apple is there.\nActually, looking at the \"Board State\" visual:\n`1 . T T T T . 1 . . A`\nRow 1 (y=1) has a `1` at x=6 (my head). It has an `A` at x=9. It does *not* show an `A` at x=6.\nWait, the text \"Apples at:\" list includes (6, 1).\nThe visual board state at (6, 1) shows `1` (my head).\nThere is a discrepancy. The \"Apples at\" list is authoritative for logic. The visual is a snapshot.\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, I am on it. But I haven't grown. This suggests (6, 1) is NOT an apple in the current game state, or the list is wrong.\nLooking at the visual again:\nRow 1: `. T T T T . 1 . . A`\nIndices 0-9.\nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: T (Enemy body? No, Enemy is at y=9. This must be my body or nothing. Wait, Enemy body is at y=9. My body is at (6,2)... (4,2). (5,1) is empty. (1,1) is my body.\nLet's trace my body against the visual.\nMy body: (6,2) -> Row 2, col 6 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (5,2) -> Row 2, col 5 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (4,2) -> Row 2, col 4 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (3,2) -> Row 2, col 3 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (2,2) -> Row 2, col 2 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (1,2) -> Row 2, col 1 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (1,1) -> Row 1, col 1 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (2,1) -> Row 1, col 2 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (3,1) -> Row 1, col 3 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (4,1) -> Row 1, col 4 is `T`. Correct.\nMy body: (6,1) -> Row 1, col 6 is `1`. Correct (Head).\nSo (5,1) is `.` (Empty).\n(7,1) is `.` (Empty).\n(6,0) is `A` (Apple).\n(5,0) is `A` (Apple).\n(7,0) is `A` (Apple).\n\nThe \"Apples at\" list in the prompt text says (6, 1) is an apple. The visual board does NOT show (6, 1) as an apple. The visual is the current state. The text list might be a summary of all apples that *ever* existed or available ones, but (6, 1) is occupied by my head.\nActually, usually in these prompts, the \"Apples at\" list is the set of apples currently on the board.\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, I am eating it *now* by being there? No, I move to get there.\nI am at (6, 1) *now*. If (6, 1) is an apple, I should have eaten it on Turn 42.\nThe prompt says \"My head is currently at (6, 1)\".\nIf (6, 1) is an apple, I am effectively standing on it. But I am not growing. This implies (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nThe text list might be slightly outdated or contain static data.\nHowever, the visual is the source of truth for the board state.\n**Visual:** (6, 1) is `1`. No `A`.\n**Visual:** (6, 0) is `A`.\n**Visual:** (7, 0) is `A`.\n**Visual:** (5, 0) is `A`.\n\nSo, I should ignore the text list claiming (6, 1) is an apple and rely on the visual `.` or `A`.\nThe text list includes: (2, 0), (1, 0), (2, 8), (4, 6), (8, 5), (7, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0), (7, 3), (5, 0), (4, 3), (9, 1), (3, 3), (0, 4), (8, 0).\nLet's check these against the visual:\n(2, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 2 is `A`. Yes.\n(1, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 1 is `A`. Yes.\n(2, 8): Visual Row 8, Col 2 is `A`. Yes.\n(4, 6): Visual Row 6, Col 4 is `A`. Yes.\n(8, 5): Visual Row 5, Col 8 is `A`. Yes.\n(7, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 7 is `A`. Yes.\n(4, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 4 is `A`. Yes.\n(6, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 6 is `A`. Yes.\n(7, 3): Visual Row 3, Col 7 is `A`. Yes.\n(5, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 5 is `A`. Yes.\n(4, 3): Visual Row 3, Col 4 is `A`. Yes.\n(9, 1): Visual Row 1, Col 9 is `A`. Yes.\n(3, 3): Visual Row 3, Col 3 is `A`. Yes.\n(0, 4): Visual Row 4, Col 0 is `A`. Yes.\n(8, 0): Visual Row 0, Col 8 is `A`. Yes.\n\nThe list does NOT include (6, 1).\nIn my \"START LAST RATIONALE\", I wrote: \"Apples available: ... (6, 1)...\".\nThat was a mistake in my previous analysis. (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nThe visual confirms (6, 1) is empty (occupied by my head).\nMy previous decision to move DOWN to (6, 0) was based on the assumption that (6, 0) is an apple and that I might want to eat it.\nBut in that rationale, I also considered (6, 1) as an apple, which led to the comment \"DOWN to (6, 1): Empty. Safe from my own body... Is it an apple? Yes\".\nThis was incorrect. (6, 1) is NOT an apple.\nHowever, I am at (6, 1) now.\nLet's re-evaluate the moves with the correct apple locations.\n\n**Current State:**\nHead: (6, 1)\nApples: (6, 0) is an apple. (5, 0) is an apple. (7, 0) is an apple.\n\n**Moves:**\n1.  **DOWN to (6, 0):** Apple. Safe.\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **UP to (6, 2):** My body. Unsafe.\n\nThis confirms my previous analysis of the *options* was correct, even if my reasoning about (6, 1) being an apple was flawed.\n\n**Decision Refinement:**\nMoving DOWN to (6, 0) eats an apple.\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 1) positions me to eat (7, 0) or (7, 3) or (9, 1).\nMoving LEFT to (5, 1) positions me to eat (5, 0) or (4, 0).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0):\nI eat an apple.\nMy body fills (6, 1).\nNext turn, from (6, 0), I can go LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0).\nThis creates a sweep of the bottom row.\nThis seems very efficient.\nIs it safe?\nEnemy is far away.\nMy body blocks (6, 1).\nFrom (6, 0), I am at the edge.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 0) -> Eat apple.\nFrom (5, 0), I can go LEFT to (4, 0) (Apple) or UP to (5, 1) (Empty).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 0) -> Eat apple.\nFrom (7, 0), I can go RIGHT to (8, 0) (Apple) or UP to (7, 1) (Empty).\n\nThis path seems very good. It clears the bottom row.\nThe only danger is if I get trapped.\nLet's look at the bottom row layout:\nRow 0: `. A A . A A A A A .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nApples at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nI am at (6, 1). (6, 0) is apple.\nIf I eat (6, 0), I am at (6, 0).\nMy body is at (6, 1), (6, 2)...\nNext move:\nOption A: LEFT to (5, 0). (Apple).\nThen LEFT to (4, 0). (Apple).\nThen LEFT to (3, 0). (Empty, but (3,0) is empty).\nFrom (4, 0), I can go UP to (4, 1). But (4, 1) is my body.\nWait. My body is at (4, 1) right now.\nCurrent Body: ... (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2).\nSo (4, 1) is occupied.\nIf I go (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0).\nAt that point (Turn 45), my body will have shifted.\nLet's simulate the shift if I eat apples (growing).\nTurn 43: Head (6, 1). Move DOWN to (6, 0). Eat. Length +1. Tail (4, 2) stays.\nNew Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), ... (4, 2)].\nTurn 44: Head (6, 0). Move LEFT to (5, 0). Eat. Length +1. Tail (4, 2) stays.\nNew Body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), ... (4, 2)].\nTurn 45: Head (5, 0). Move LEFT to (4, 0). Eat. Length +1. Tail (4, 2) stays.\nNew Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), ... (4, 2)].\nTurn 46: Head (4, 0). Where to go?\nNeighbors of (4, 0):\n- LEFT: (3, 0). Empty.\n- RIGHT: (5, 0). Occupied by my body (segment 2).\n- UP: (4, 1). Occupied by my body (segment ???).\n- DOWN: (4, -1). Wall.\n\nLet's trace my body segments at Turn 46 (assuming 3 moves made, 3 apples eaten, tail hasn't moved yet because we grew).\nTail at Turn 43: (4, 2).\nIf we haven't eaten, tail moves. If we eat, tail stays.\nTo sweep the bottom row, I need to eat apples at (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0).\n(4, 0) is an apple.\nSo I will eat 3 apples.\nMy length increases by 3.\nMy tail (4, 2) will not move for 3 turns.\nMy body segments shift forward.\nOriginal Body (Turn 43):\n0: Head (6, 1)\n1: (6, 2)\n2: (6, 3)\n...\n19: (2, 1)\n20: (3, 1)\n21: (4, 1)\n22: (4, 2) <- Tail\n\nAfter 1 move (DOWN to 6,0):\nNew Body:\n0: (6, 0)\n1: (6, 1) (old head)\n2: (6, 2)\n...\n22: (4, 2) (Tail)\n23: (4, 1) (New tail if we didn't eat? No, we ate. Tail stays 22).\n\nWait, if I eat, the tail stays.\nSo at Turn 46 (after 3 moves and 3 eats), the tail is still (4, 2).\nThe body sequence will be:\nHead: (4, 0)\nSegment 1: (5, 0)\nSegment 2: (6, 0)\nSegment 3: (6, 1)\nSegment 4: (6, 2)\n...\nSegment 20: (4, 2) (Tail)\n\nLet's check where (4, 1) is in this sequence.\nOriginal index of (4, 1) was 21.\nShifted index 21 -> 22.\nShifted index 22 -> 23.\nWait, the list grows at the front.\nAt Turn 46, the body list (from head) is:\n[(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\nTotal length: 27 segments (0-26).\nIndex 26 is (4, 2).\nIndex 25 is (4, 1).\n\nAt Turn 46, if I am at (4, 0), can I move UP to (4, 1)?\n(4, 1) is at index 25. The tail is at index 26.\nSo (4, 1) is occupied.\nSo I cannot move UP from (4, 0).\nCan I move LEFT to (3, 0)?\n(3, 0) is empty.\nCan I move RIGHT to (5, 0)?\n(5, 0) is occupied (index 1).\nCan I move DOWN?\nWall.\n\nSo from (4, 0), my only move is LEFT to (3, 0).\n(3, 0) is empty.\nFrom (3, 0):\nNeighbors:\n- LEFT: (2, 0) -> Apple.\n- RIGHT: (4, 0) -> My body (head from previous turn).\n- UP: (3, 1) -> My body (index 24).\n- DOWN: Wall.\n\nSo I can go LEFT to (2, 0).\n(2, 0) is an apple.\nFrom (2, 0):\nNeighbors:\n- LEFT: (1, 0) -> Apple.\n- RIGHT: (3, 0) -> My body.\n- UP: (2, 1) -> My body (index 23).\n- DOWN: Wall.\n\nI can go LEFT to (1, 0).\n(1, 0) is an apple.\nFrom (1, 0):\nNeighbors:\n- LEFT: (0, 0) -> Empty.\n- RIGHT: (2, 0) -> My body.\n- UP: (1, 1) -> My body (index 22).\n- DOWN: Wall.\n\nI can go LEFT to (0, 0).\nFrom (0, 0):\nNeighbors:\n- RIGHT: (1, 0) -> My body.\n- UP: (0, 1) -> Empty? Let's check board.\nVisual Row 1, Col 0 is `.`.\n- DOWN: Wall.\n\nSo from (0, 0), I can go UP to (0, 1).\n\nThis entire path seems viable and clears a huge number of apples.\nTotal apples on bottom row I can eat: (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (2,0), (1,0). That's 5 apples.\nPlus (0,0) is empty, but (0,1) is empty.\nWait, (0,4) is an apple. (0, 4) is further up.\n\nThe strategy of moving DOWN to (6, 0) initiates this sweep.\nIs there any reason NOT to do this?\nWhat if I go RIGHT to (7, 1)?\nThen (6, 0) is left behind. (6, 0) is an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I might miss (6, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (7, 1).\nFrom (7, 1), I can go DOWN to (7, 0) (Apple).\nFrom (7, 0), I can go LEFT to (6, 0) (Apple).\nFrom (6, 0), I can go LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple).\nThis is the same sweep, just shifted right by 1 step.\nPath: (6,1) -> (7,1) -> (7,0) -> (6,0) -> (5,0) -> ...\nThis also works.\nBut does it have risks?\n(7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0).\nAt (6, 0), I am coming from (7, 0).\nMy body will be at (7, 1), (6, 1), ...\nFrom (6, 0), I go LEFT to (5, 0).\nMy body at (6, 1) is the neck.\nThis is safe.\n\nHowever, starting with DOWN to (6, 0) is more direct to the apples (6, 0) is immediate.\nStarting with RIGHT delays eating (6, 0) and goes to (7, 1) first.\n(7, 1) is empty. (6, 0) is an apple.\nWhy not eat the apple immediately?\nThere is no downside to eating (6, 0) immediately. It is safe.\nThe path analysis confirms I can sweep the bottom row starting from (6, 0).\n\nOne check: What about the apple at (3, 3) and (4, 3)?\nMy body currently blocks (4, 1) and (4, 2).\n(4, 3) is an apple.\nIf I sweep the bottom row, I will eventually reach (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4).\nFrom there, I can move RIGHT along the top of the bottom row (y=3).\n(0, 4) is an apple.\n(3, 3) is an apple.\n(4, 3) is an apple.\n(7, 3) is an apple.\nThis seems like a very high scoring route.\n\nWhat is the enemy doing?\nSnake #0 is at (0, 9).\nIt is blocked by walls and my body at y=9.\nIt must move down.\nIt can move to (0, 8) or (1, 8).\nIf it moves to (0, 8), it is far away.\nIf it moves to (1, 8), it is approaching my body at (2, 8) (which is an apple? No, (2, 8) is an apple. Wait.\nVisual Row 8: `. . A T T T T . T .`\n(2, 8) is `A` (Apple).\nMy body is at (3, 8) `T`.\nSo (2, 8) is an apple adjacent to my body.\nThe enemy snake #0 body is at (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)...\n(2, 8) is directly below (2, 9).\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (2, 8), it will eat that apple.\nThat is good for the enemy.\nCan I stop it?\nI am at (6, 1). I cannot reach (2, 8) in one turn.\nI cannot influence that.\nI should focus on my own survival and scoring.\n\nMy strategy is solid. I will sweep the bottom row.\nStarting with DOWN to (6, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nInitiate bottom row sweep.\nPath: (6, 1) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4).\nThen traverse right along y=3 to collect (3, 3), (4, 3), (7, 3), etc.\nAvoid contact with Snake #0.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is trapped by the wall and my body (which is at (3,9) to (9,9) and (3,8)). It must move down.\n- **Apples:** I am currently on (6, 0) which is an apple. I should have eaten it. Since I am at (6, 0), my score should be 25 (from previous 24). The prompt lists apples but doesn't explicitly say \"apples eaten this turn\", but if I am at (6, 0) and it is an apple, I have likely eaten it. The prompt says \"Head: (6, 0)\" and Body follows. This implies I just moved to (6, 0).\n\n**Decision Process:**\nI am at the bottom row (y=0) at (6, 0). I am at the edge. I cannot move DOWN.\nMy body is immediately to my RIGHT at (6, 1). Moving UP into (6, 1) is moving into my own neck, which is illegal/suicide.\nAvailable moves: LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0).\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe. (5, 0) is an apple.\n    -   **Result:** I eat an apple, grow. My head moves to (5, 0). My body fills (6, 0) and (6, 1).\n    -   **Next Turn View:** From (5, 0), I will be at the bottom edge. My neck will be (6, 0). Blocked moves: DOWN (wall), RIGHT (neck). Open moves: LEFT (4, 0 - Apple), UP (5, 1 - Empty). 2 safe moves.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe. (7, 0) is an apple.\n    -   **Result:** I eat an apple, grow. My head moves to (7, 0). My body fills (6, 0) and (6, 1).\n    -   **Next Turn View:** From (7, 0), I will be at the bottom edge. My neck will be (6, 0). Blocked moves: DOWN (wall), LEFT (neck). Open moves: RIGHT (8, 0 - Apple), UP (7, 1 - Empty). 2 safe moves.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\nBoth moves provide immediate points (apples at 5,0 and 7,0).\n- **Left:** Moves me towards the cluster at (4,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0). This leads to the corner (0,0), which is a high-value area but requires careful turning.\n- **Right:** Moves me towards (8,0), (9,0). Then I can go UP to (8,1) or (9,1). (9,0) is a corner, but (9,1) is open to (9,2), etc. The right side is slightly more open because the enemy is on the far left. However, the enemy snake #0 is near the top left. The bottom row is clear.\n\nBoth are safe. I am winning (score difference is large).\nI will choose **LEFT**. Why? It continues the sweep towards the corner (0,0) and the cluster of apples there. Moving right goes to (7,0) -> (8,0) -> (9,0). Once at (9,0), I am in a corner. To get out, I must go UP to (9,1). (9,1) is safe, but (9,2) is blocked by the enemy snake body at (9,6)? No, the enemy body at x=9 is at y=6, 5... So (9,2) is safe. Actually, the right side is very safe. But the left side has more apples condensed: (4,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0) are all on the left. (8,0) and (9,0) are on the right.\nGoing LEFT sets up a cleaner sweep of the densest apple cluster on the bottom row.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 0). Continue sweeping the bottom row leftwards to (0, 0). Then move UP to (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3) collecting apples, then traverse right along y=3.\n\n**Final Check:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 0).\n- Collision: No (empty, apple).\n- Wall: No.\n- Self: No.\n- Enemy: No (far away).\nResult: Safe + Apple.\n\nLEFT",

That creates a risk of getting funneled into a short corridor and limits escape routes after grabbing the apple.\n- Moving DOWN keeps me on the left edge with open space below (clear path to apples at (0,4) and eventually (0,0)), farther from the enemy\u2019s dense body and head. It preserves more safe follow-up moves (I can continue down or later move right when safe).\n\nPlan (next few turns):\n- Move down the left column toward the apple at (0,4), collecting safe apples and staying out of the enemy\u2019s crowded area.\n- Avoid moving right into row 8 where the enemy\u2019s body forms a blockade until it clearly vacates.\n- Stay mindful of potential head-on threats if the enemy moves toward the left side; keep escape options open by not entering tight corridors.\n\nMOVE: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

My body spans from (6, 8) down to (4, 2).\n- **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (0, 7). Their body spans the top row and right side (x=9). They are effectively trapped in the top left corner and will likely start moving down soon.\n- **Apples:** (5, 0) is an apple (likely just eaten). The densest cluster is on the bottom left: (4, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0).\n\n**Decision Process:**\nI am at (5, 0). Available moves:\n1.  **LEFT to (4, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe. (4, 0) is an apple.\n    -   **Result:** Eat apple, grow. Head moves to (4, 0).\n    -   **Next Turn View:** From (4, 0), I will be at the bottom edge. Neck is (5, 0). Blocked moves: DOWN (wall), RIGHT (neck). Open moves: LEFT (3, 0 - Safe), UP (4, 1 - Safe).\n    -   **Strategic Value:** Moves me directly towards the densest apple cluster.

Open moves: LEFT (4, 1), RIGHT (6, 1), UP (5, 2).\n    -   **Strategic Value:** Moves me up, away from the bottom row cluster.

While safe, it might complicate the path to the bottom row corner (0, 0) later.\n-   Given the objective to maximize points and keep options open, clearing the bottom row is a strong move.

I just moved LEFT from (4,0) to (3,0) (simulated). I need to move to (2,0) to eat the apple there. Then (1,0). Then (0,0). After clearing the bottom row, I need to navigate around my own body to reach the apples at (0,1) and (0,4). The enemy is at (0,5). I must be careful not to get trapped by the enemy if I go up the left wall. If the enemy moves down to (0,4) or (0,3), I should consider a diversion to the right side of the board (which is currently safer).\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\n**START MOVE RATIONALE**\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- **Turn:** 47 / 150.\n- **My Head:** (3, 0).\n- **My Body:** [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), ...]. Note: (3, 1) is occupied by my body. (2, 1) is occupied.\n- **Enemy:** Snake #0 at (0, 5). Body occupies the left wall and top-right.\n- **Apples:** (2, 0) is an apple.\n\n**Decision Process:**\nAvailable moves from (3, 0):\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe (Empty). Not a wall. Not occupied by my body (my body starts at (4, 0)). Not occupied by enemy (enemy is at x=0).\n    -   **Result:** **Apple Eaten**. I grow by 1. Score becomes 27.\n    -   **Next Turn View:** From (2, 0), Neck is (3, 0). Open moves: LEFT (1, 0 - Apple), DOWN (Wall). Blocked: RIGHT (3, 0). UP (2, 1) is my body.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** Essential. This is the immediate objective.\n\n2.  **UP to (3, 1):**\n    -   **Status:** **Crash**. Occupied by my body at (3, 1). This is a self-collision.\n    -   **Result:** Death.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (3, -1):** Invalid (Wall).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe (Empty). Occupied by my body previously, but it moves away as I move.\n    -   **Result:** No apple.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** Backtracking. Leaves the apple at (2,0) behind.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **LEFT (2, 0)** is the only logical move. It yields an apple and sets up the next move to (1, 0). Moving UP or RIGHT avoids the points and forces a longer loop.\n\nI will move **LEFT** to (2, 0).\n**END MOVE RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

That means the enemy will take (2,0) this turn and will not threaten me on the left column.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1,5) is safe short-term but leads toward the crowded center where many enemy body segments sit (notably (2,5), (2,4), etc.), increasing the risk of being funneled.\n- Moving DOWN to (0,4) picks up a nearby apple immediately, keeps me along the left wall away from the enemy head and long enemy column at x=6, and preserves clear routes down to (0,0) and other bottom apples.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Take (0,4) now, then continue down the left column to (0,0) if safe, collecting bottom apples. Stay on the wall to maintain maneuverability and avoid the enemy\u2019s congested center. Re-evaluate after the enemy moves (they will likely go to (2,0)) and decide whether to contest bottom-right apples based on their positioning.\n\nMOVE: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

It preserves simple, safe routes down to the bottom apples and keeps options to swing right later if needed.\n\nEnemy head prediction:\n- Enemy head is at (2,0) with neck at (3,0). Their only realistic legal move is LEFT to (1,0) (UP to (2,1) is occupied by their own body), so they will take (1,0) this turn and then likely (0,0) on their next turn. I will not beat them to the bottom-left apples.\n\nDecision and short-term plan:\n- Choose DOWN to (0,3). This follows my previous plan of hugging the left wall, avoids moving into the congested center, and keeps escape routes open.\n- Next turns: continue down the left column to collect whatever bottom apples remain if uncontested, then sweep right along the bottom if safe. If the enemy commits to the bottom row, pivot to higher-value apples away from their long spine (e.g., move up and approach less-contested apples).\n\nDOWN",

The body fills the entire bottom row from x=2 to x=6 at y=0, and snakes up through (6,1) to (6,8), across to (3,8), and down the left side at x=3. The cell (2, 1) is free, as is (1, 1).\n- **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (0, 3). Its body fills the left wall (x=0) from y=4 to y=9, and then across the top to (8, 8). It is effectively blocked from the bottom left.\n- **Apples:** (0, 0) is an apple just to my left. (1, 0) was eaten last turn.\n\n**Decision Process:**\nAvailable moves from (1, 0):\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe (Empty). Not a wall. Not occupied by my body. Not occupied by enemy.\n    -   **Result:** **Apple Eaten**. I grow by 1. Score becomes 29.\n    -   **Next Turn View:** From (0, 0), Neck is (1, 0). Open moves: DOWN (Wall), LEFT (Wall). Blocked: RIGHT (1, 0). UP (0, 1) is a Wall (Enemy body is at (0,3), (0,1) and (0,2) are empty but (0,1) is a wall coordinate? Wait, y=1 is valid. Is (0, 1) occupied? Enemy body is at (0,3) and above. (0, 1) and (0, 2) are empty. However, (0, 0) is a corner. If I eat the apple at (0, 0), my tail will extend to (4, 2). My body will fill (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)... (6,0). The only escape from (0,0) is UP to (0,1). This is a \"corner trap\" situation, but given my length (29+ segments), I am long enough that moving UP to (0,1) is viable if I can clear space. The enemy is at (0,3). If I go (0,0) -> (0,1), I am moving towards the enemy body. The gap between me and the enemy is (0,1) and (0,2). I must ensure I don't get pinched.\n    -   **Strategic Value:** High. Secures the apple. Brings me to 29 points (one away from winning). Puts me in a position to potentially cut off the enemy or force it into a wall.\n\n2.  **UP to (1, 1):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe (Empty). (1, 1) is currently occupied by my tail? No, my tail is at (4, 1) currently. Wait, let's look at my body list: `..., (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)`. Actually, `(1, 1)` IS part of my body. My body flows: `(2,0) -> (3,0)... (6,8) -> (5,8) -> ... -> (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (2,5) -> ... -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> ...`. So (1, 1) is occupied by my body. Moving UP is **DEATH**.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (1, -1):** Invalid (Wall).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 0):**\n    -   **Status:** Safe (Empty). (2, 0) is currently my neck (since I came from (2,0) to (1,0)). Moving back to my neck is valid in this game engine (unlike standard snake rules where it's suicide, here it's explicitly stated \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die\". Wait, the rules say: *\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"* AND *\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"*. (2, 0) is the cell behind my head. My body is at (2, 0). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (2, 0) is **DEATH**.\n\n**Refining the LEFT move:**\nMoving LEFT to (0, 0) is the only non-suicidal move. Even if it puts me in a tight spot, I am forced to take it.\nHowever, I must consider the enemy's move. The enemy is at (0, 3). The enemy has 15 apples. The enemy likely wants to eat the apples near it or move towards the center.\nIf I move to (0, 0), I block the bottom left.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (0, 2), it will die because I will be at (0, 0) and (0, 1) will be empty, but wait, if the enemy moves to (0, 2), its head is at (0, 2). My body is at (0, 0). There is a gap at (0, 1). No collision.\nHowever, if the enemy moves DOWN to (0, 2) and I move UP to (0, 1) next turn, I might trap it.\nActually, let's look at the Board State.\nRow 0: `A 1 T T T T T A A .`\n(0,0) is A (Apple). (1,0) is 1 (Me). (2,0) is T (My tail).\nIf I move LEFT to (0,0):\nMy new head: (0,0).\nMy body: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), ... (4,1).\nNext turn, I will be at (0,0). The only exit is UP to (0,1).\n(0,1) is currently `.` (Empty) on the board state.\n(0,2) is `T` (Enemy Body? No, Enemy is at (0,3). (0,2) is empty based on the board state `.` at (0,2).\nWait, Board State Row 3: `0 . T A A . T A . .`\n`0` is Enemy Head (0,3).\n`T` at (2,3) is My Body (part of the vertical spine).\n(0,2) is `.`.\n(0,1) is `.`.\nSo, if I go (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2), I am moving directly towards the Enemy Head at (0,3).\nIf the Enemy moves DOWN to (0,2) this turn, and I move LEFT to (0,0), no collision this turn.\nNext turn:\nMy head: (0,0). Enemy head: (0,2).\nI move UP to (0,1). Enemy moves DOWN to (0,1)? Collision. Or Enemy moves LEFT (Wall) or RIGHT (Into my body? (1,2) is empty?).\nIf the Enemy moves DOWN to (0,2) this turn, they are placing their head adjacent to my current position (1,0) and (0,0).\nIf I move LEFT to (0,0), and Enemy moves DOWN to (0,2):\nNext turn, I am at (0,0). Enemy is at (0,2). (0,1) is between us.\nIf I move UP to (0,1) and Enemy moves DOWN to (0,1), we die (tie).\nIf I move UP to (0,1) and Enemy moves RIGHT to (1,2), we live.\nHowever, if Enemy moves DOWN to (0,2) *this* turn, they are committing to the bottom left corner.\nGiven my length (28 apples), I am very long. I can probably survive the corner if I move carefully.\nThe only alternative to LEFT is RIGHT, which is suicide (backwards into self).\nTherefore, I must move LEFT.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Move LEFT to (0, 0) to eat the apple.\n2.  Reach 29 apples.\n3.  Prepare to move UP to (0, 1) next turn to avoid the wall and keep options open.\n4.  Watch the enemy. If they move into the corner, we might have a collision, but I am forced to eat the apple to get closer to winning (30 apples). At 30 apples, the game ends immediately and I win (unless they also reach 30, but they are at 15).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0,0) to reach 29 points. Move UP to (0,1) next turn to escape the corner and position myself to cut off the enemy snake or force a collision if they pursue the bottom left area. I need 1 more apple to win.\n\nLEFT",

It also avoids any head-on risk this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Continue down the left column to (0,1). If the enemy leaves the bottom row open later, consider sweeping right along the bottom; otherwise, climb back up the left side and look for less-contested apples (e.g., approach apples around x=3 from above when safe). Avoid entering the crowded center near the enemy spine.\n\nDecision:\nDOWN",

My body extends from (1, 0) along the bottom row, then snakes up the right side and back down the left. The neck is (1, 0).\n- **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (0, 2). Its body extends up from there to the top and across the top.\n- **Apples:** (0, 0) was an apple, which I must have eaten on the previous turn (Turn 49) to arrive here, as I am alive. The apples list includes (0,0) in the grid, so it's still present or I ate it and grew. Wait, if I ate it, my tail would have extended to (4, 2). (0,0) is marked 'A' in the grid, but my head '1' is on it. Usually, '1' overwrites 'A'. The grid shows 'A' at (0,0) and '1' at (1,0). Let's re-read the grid.\n  - Row 0: `A 1 T T T T T A A .`\n  - My head is at (1, 0) in the grid (based on the provided state). Wait, the prompt says \"Your snake... Head: (0, 0)\". But the board state shows '1' at (1,0) and 'A' at (0,0). This is a contradiction or I am misinterpreting the ASCII art.\n  - Let's look at the ASCII art labels:\n    Row 9: `9 T T T T T T T T T .`\n    Row 0: `0 1 T T T T T T A A .`\n    X coords: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (0,0) corresponds to the first char of row 0, which is 'A'.\n    (1,0) corresponds to the second char, which is '1'.\n    The text description says \"Head: (0, 0)\". The ASCII shows '1' at (1,0).\n    There is likely a mismatch in the description vs the grid. However, I must trust the text description provided in the prompt: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (0, 0)\". The text description is authoritative for the state.\n    If my head is (0,0), the 'A' at (0,0) is likely just an apple, and I am sitting on it. The '1' at (1,0) must be a mistake in the ASCII rendering or I am seeing the *previous* state's layout? No, the prompt says \"Board state:\" followed by the grid. If I am at (0,0), the char at (0,0) should be '1'.\n    Let's look at the *Last Move Info*.\n    Last Move: LEFT.\n    Previous Head: (1, 0).\n    New Head: (0, 0).\n    This confirms I moved from (1,0) to (0,0).\n    So my Head is (0,0).\n    The grid shows '1' at (1,0). This is an error in the provided grid snapshot, or the grid is showing the state *before* my move update.\n    Regardless of the grid artifact, I am at (0, 0).\n    (0, 0) is a corner.\n    My neck is (1, 0).\n    Enemy Head is at (0, 2).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1.  **LEFT:** ( -1, 0 ). Invalid (Wall).\n2.  **DOWN:** (0, -1 ). Invalid (Wall).\n3.  **RIGHT:** (1, 0). My neck is (1, 0). Moving into my own body is death. Dead.\n4.  **UP:** (0, 1). Check safety.\n    -   Is (0, 1) a wall? No (y=1 is valid).\n    -   Is (0, 1) in my body?\n        My body list: `[(1, 0), (2, 0), ...]`. (0, 1) is not in the list.\n        Wait, my body list ends at (4, 1). So (0,1) is clear.\n    -   Is (0, 1) occupied by Enemy Body?\n        Enemy body: `[(0, 3), ...]`. (0, 1) is not in the list.\n    -   Is there a head-on collision risk?\n        Enemy Head is at (0, 2). If I move UP to (0, 1), and Enemy moves DOWN to (0, 1), we collide.\n        Is Enemy likely to move DOWN?\n        Enemy is at (0, 2). Down is (0, 1). Left is Wall. Right is (1, 2).\n        (1, 2) is currently 'T' in the grid (My body).\n        Enemy cannot move Right because it hits my body.\n        Enemy cannot move Left (Wall).\n        Enemy must move DOWN or UP.\n        If Enemy moves UP to (0, 3), it hits its own body (tail at (0,3)).\n        Actually, looking at Enemy body: Head (0,2), Body (0,3)... (0,9)...\n        If Enemy moves UP to (0,3), that is currently its body segment.\n        So Enemy cannot move UP.\n        Therefore, Enemy is forced to move DOWN to (0, 1).\n        If I move UP to (0, 1), we will collide head-to-head at (0, 1).\n        Result: Both snakes die.\n        Since I am at 29 apples and Enemy is at 15, if we both die, I win (29 > 15).\n        However, if I can survive, that is better.\n        Is there any other move?\n        No. LEFT/WALL, DOWN/WALL, RIGHT/BODY.\n        The only move is UP.\n        If I move UP, I collide with Enemy (who is forced to move DOWN).\n        Wait, if Enemy is forced to move DOWN, and I move UP, we die.\n        Is there any scenario where I survive?\n        What if Enemy moves Right into my body? (1, 2) is my body.\n        If Enemy moves Right, it dies by hitting my body. I survive.\n        But Enemy is not suicidal. Enemy will choose the move that keeps them alive or at least tries to.\n        However, looking at the constraints:\n        Enemy at (0, 2).\n        Options:\n        -   DOWN (0, 1): Valid empty space?\n        -   UP (0, 3): My body? No, Enemy body.\n        -   LEFT ( -1, 2): Wall.\n        -   RIGHT (1, 2): My body.\n        The only move that doesn't result in immediate death for the Enemy is DOWN.\n        So Enemy MUST move DOWN.\n        I MUST move UP.\n        We collide at (0, 1).\n        Mutual death.\n        I win because 29 > 15.\n        \n        Wait, let's double check the \"win condition\" if we die simultaneously.\n        \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\"\n        My apples: 29 (plus the one I just ate? No, turn 50 is the move. I haven't processed the apple count for this turn yet. Wait, \"Turn: 50\". The move happens now.\n        Actually, in the previous turn (49), I moved LEFT to (0,0). That was an apple. So I grew.\n        My apples should be 30?\n        Let's check \"Your last move information\".\n        Last move: LEFT.\n        Last rationale: \"Moving LEFT to (0, 0) is the only non-suicidal move.\"\n        \"Result: Apple Eaten. I grow by 1. Score becomes 29.\"\n        Wait, \"Scores so far\" says: \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 29\".\n        This implies I haven't counted the apple at (0,0) yet, or the turn hasn't incremented.\n        If I am at (0,0) now, and I ate the apple on turn 49, my score is now 30?\n        No, \"Turn: 50\" means we are *about* to move for turn 50.\n        So on turn 49, I moved to (0,0). I ate an apple.\n        Score became 30?\n        Or did I start turn 49 with 29, eat apple, score 30, end turn 49?\n        The prompt says \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 29\".\n        This is confusing. Usually, \"Scores so far\" reflects the current state.\n        If I ate an apple, my score should be 30.\n        If my score is 30, I should have won immediately at the end of turn 49?\n        \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 30 apples.\"\n        If I reached 30 on turn 49, the game would be over.\n        The fact that it is Turn 50 means I did NOT reach 30 apples yet.\n        Therefore, the apple at (0,0) did not bring me to 30.\n        This means either:\n        1. I didn't eat an apple at (0,0) (but the rationale said I did).\n        2. My score was 28, I ate one, became 29.\n        \n        Let's re-read the prompt carefully.\n        \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 29\".\n        \"Turn: 50 / 150\".\n        If I am at (0,0) at the start of Turn 50, I moved there in Turn 49.\n        If I ate an apple in Turn 49, my score increased by 1.\n        So I must have had 28 apples at the start of Turn 49 to have 29 now.\n        Wait, the \"last rationale\" said: \"Score becomes 29\".\n        So I had 28, ate one, now have 29.\n        This means the prompt's \"Scores so far\" matches the state at the start of Turn 50.\n        Okay.\n        \n        So, current situation:\n        I am at (0,0). Score 29.\n        Enemy at (0,2). Score 15.\n        \n        If we collide at (0,1), we both die.\n        My score 29, Enemy score 15.\n        I win.\n        \n        Is there any way to avoid collision?\n        Enemy at (0,2).\n        Valid moves for Enemy:\n        -   DOWN (0,1).\n        -   UP (0,3): Enemy Body.\n        -   LEFT: Wall.\n        -   RIGHT (1,2): My Body.\n        \n        If Enemy moves RIGHT into my body (1,2), Enemy dies.\n        I survive.\n        This is the best case.\n        Can I force Enemy to move RIGHT?\n        No, Enemy chooses their move.\n        But if Enemy realizes they are trapped and must move DOWN (leading to collision) or RIGHT (suicide into body), they might choose DOWN to force a draw or hope I change direction.\n        \n        My moves:\n        -   UP (0,1).\n        -   LEFT: Wall.\n        -   DOWN: Wall.\n        -   RIGHT (1,0): My Neck/Body.\n        \n        I have NO choice but to move UP.\n        Enemy has NO choice but to move DOWN or RIGHT.\n        If Enemy moves DOWN -> Collision -> I win (29 > 15).\n        If Enemy moves RIGHT -> Enemy dies -> I survive.\n        \n        If I move UP, I guarantee that I do not move into a wall or my own body.\n        I cannot control Enemy's move.\n        But logically, if Enemy moves DOWN, I die, but I win because I have more apples.\n        If Enemy moves RIGHT, I live and continue.\n        \n        However, is there any scenario where I move UP and Enemy moves DOWN, but we don't collide?\n        No, we occupy the same cell (0,1).\n        \n        Wait, is (0,1) an apple?\n        Board state Row 1: `. T T T T T T A . A`\n        X=0 is `.`. Empty.\n        So no apple at (0,1).\n        \n        What about the body collision?\n        If I move UP to (0,1), and Enemy moves DOWN to (0,1).\n        Result: Head-on collision. Both die.\n        \n        Is there any other interpretation?\n        Maybe I am misreading the Enemy body.\n        Enemy Head: (0, 2).\n        Enemy Body: `[(0, 3), ...]`.\n        So (0, 2) is Head. (0, 3) is neck.\n        If Enemy moves UP to (0, 3), it hits its own neck. Dies.\n        If Enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 2), it hits my body. Dies.\n        If Enemy moves DOWN to (0, 1), it is safe (empty).\n        \n        So Enemy will likely choose DOWN.\n        \n        What if I don't move UP?\n        I cannot. LEFT/WALL, DOWN/WALL, RIGHT/BODY.\n        \n        So the decision is forced.\n        I move UP.\n        Enemy likely moves DOWN.\n        We collide.\n        I win.\n        \n        Let's verify if I have 30 apples.\n        \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 1) apples: 29\".\n        \"Turn: 50\".\n        I ate an apple on Turn 49 (move LEFT to 0,0).\n        So I am alive.\n        If I had reached 30, game would have ended.\n        So I have 29.\n        \n        Okay.\n        \n        **Strategy Note:**\n        I am in a corner at (0,0). Enemy is at (0,2) blocked by walls and my body. The only logical move for both of us is towards each other. This will result in a head-on collision. Since I have 29 apples and the enemy has 15, a mutual death results in my victory. I must execute this move.\n\n**START STRATEGY NOTE**\nI am trapped in the corner at (0,0). My only legal move is UP. The enemy is trapped at (0,2) with no legal moves except DOWN (into me) or RIGHT (into my body). If the enemy moves DOWN, we collide head-on and both die. Since I have 29 apples and the enemy has 15, a mutual death results in my victory. If the enemy moves RIGHT into my body, they die and I survive. In either case, moving UP is the only valid move and leads to a win condition.\n**END STRATEGY NOTE**\n\nUP",
