The enemy snake is far away at (3, 0), so not an immediate threat.\n\n3. Best immediate move would be to go RIGHT to (8, 7) to get the closest apple.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nAfter getting the apple at (8, 7), I'll want to move UP to get access to the two apples at (5, 8) and (6, 8). This will give me good control of the upper portion of the board.\n\nI'm going to move RIGHT to get the closest apple.\n\nRIGHT"

As for the strategy, it would be wise to avoid enemy snakes and try to eat as many apples as possible while keeping a safe distance from other snakes.\n\nNext move: R"
