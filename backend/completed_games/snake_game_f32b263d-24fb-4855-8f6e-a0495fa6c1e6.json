Neither of these positions overlap with any of the enemy's possible moves, so no head-on collision.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the remaining safe moves**\n\nDOWN to (2,8): This move brings me closer to the apple at (2,6) and the apple at (0,2). After this move, my body will become [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7)] and I'll be at (2,8).\n\nLEFT to (1,9): This move brings me closer to the apple at (1,8) and also keeps me away from the enemy at (6,6). After this move, my body will become [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7)] and I'll be at (1,9).\n\n**Step 4: Choose the best move**\n\nBoth moves are safe and none immediately gain an apple. Moving LEFT to (1,9) brings me closer to the apple at (1,8) and positions me well for potentially reaching it in the next few moves. Moving DOWN to (2,8) moves me away from the apple at (1,8) and closer to the apple at (2,6) but not immediately.\n\nGiven the current board state and the proximity to the apple at (1,8), LEFT to (1,9) provides the best path toward potentially collecting an apple while maintaining mobility.\n\n**Strategy note:** After moving LEFT to (1,9), I should assess the board state and consider moving toward the apple at (1,8). I need to be cautious of the enemy snake at (6,6) and avoid getting too close to it. I should continue to focus on collecting apples while maintaining mobility and avoiding the enemy's head.\n\nLEFT",
