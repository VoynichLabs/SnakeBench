Moving right might seem tempting to reach the apple at (2, 3), but it risks a head-on collision and could lead to Snake #0 catching up. Moving up would be better, as it takes me closer to the apple while still avoiding immediate confrontation. It doesn't offer a huge advantage in terms of speed, but it's a safer move.\n\nI need to avoid being cornered which will make it difficult to escape Snake #0. The goal is to maintain a safe distance while continuing to approach the apples. Therefore moving up will be the optimal choice.\n\n**UP**",
