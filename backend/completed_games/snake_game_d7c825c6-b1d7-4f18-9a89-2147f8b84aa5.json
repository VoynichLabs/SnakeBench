The list above says apples at (7,2), (1,1), (3,6), (8,6), (5,2)].\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,6) with no body (so it is just a head).\n\nPossible moves from my head (7,7):\n- UP: (7,8) - but this is my body segment (the first body part), so moving UP would hit my own body and die.\n- DOWN: (7,6) - valid and safe (within board, no snake body there).\n- LEFT: (6,7) - valid and safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,7) - valid and safe.\n\nSo UP is unsafe (immediate death). DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, consider the benefits:\n- DOWN (7,6): moves towards the apple at (7,2) (but still far) and also towards (5,2). Also, it opens up the bottom area.\n- LEFT (6,7): moves away from the cluster of apples? But there is an apple at (3,6) and (1,1) in that direction.\n- RIGHT (8,7): moves towards the apple at (8,6) (very close! only one step away).\n\nThe apple at (8,6) is adjacent to RIGHT? From (8,7), DOWN would lead to (8,6) next turn. So moving RIGHT to (8,7) sets me up to eat the apple at (8,6) next turn (if I move DOWN then).\n\nAlso, enemy snake is at (1,6), which is far away and not a threat currently.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (8,7) is very attractive because it positions me to eat the apple at (8,6) next turn. This would give me my 4th apple.\n\nCheck safety for RIGHT: (8,7) is empty (from the board state: at row 7, column 8 is '.'). So no collision.\n\nAlso, after moving RIGHT, my head will be at (8,7) and my body will be [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8)]. Then next turn, I can move DOWN to (8,6) to eat the apple.\n\nOther moves:\n- DOWN (7,6) is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple immediately.\n- LEFT (6,7) is safe but moves away from the dense apples (8,6) and (7,2)).\n\nSo RIGHT is the best move to get an apple quickly.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (8,6), I should consider moving towards (7,2) or (5,2) while avoiding trapping myself. Also, note that enemy snake might be moving towards apples too, but it is currently far.\n\n**Final move: RIGHT**",

Wait, last turn I moved to (8,7) and didn't eat an apple, so I should not have grown. Actually, last turn I started with head at (7,7) and body [(7,8), (8,8)] and apples collected 2. Then I moved RIGHT to (8,7). Since I didn't eat an apple, I should not grow. So my body should now be [(7,7), (7,8)]? But the body list given is [(7,7), (7,8)] which is correct for current state: head at (8,7), then first body at (7,7) (previous head), then (7,8) (previous first body). So length is 3 segments (head + 2 body parts) and apples collected is 2 (since I didn't eat last turn).\n\nApples are at: (7,2), (1,1), (3,6), (8,6), (5,2). Note that (8,6) is very close.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,6) with no body (so just a head).\n\nPossible moves from my head (8,7):\n- UP: (8,8) - is this safe? Check board: at row 8, column 8 is '.' (empty). Also, it is not in my body list: my body is at (7,7) and (7,8). So UP is safe.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - this is an apple! So moving DOWN would eat the apple and grow.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - this is my body (the first body segment). So moving LEFT would hit my own body and die.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - within board? Yes (x from 0 to 9). Check if occupied: board shows row 7, column 9 is '.' (empty). So safe.\n\nSo LEFT is unsafe (immediate death). UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, benefits:\n- DOWN (8,6): directly eats the apple. This would give me my 3rd apple and grow to 4 segments. Very beneficial.\n- UP (8,8): moves away from the apple, but might be safe for future.\n- RIGHT (9,7): moves to the edge, which might limit future moves.\n\nMoving DOWN to eat the apple is clearly the best choice. It is safe (no collision) and immediately gains an apple.\n\nSafety check for DOWN: (8,6) is an apple, so no snake body there. Also, enemy snake is at (2,6), which is far and not a threat. There is no risk of head-on collision because enemy is moving simultaneously, but from (2,6) it cannot reach (8,6) in one move.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (8,6), my head will be at (8,6) and I will have 3 apples (so body length 4). Then I should consider moving towards other apples like (7,2) or (5,2) while avoiding traps. Also, note the enemy snake might be moving towards apples in the left area.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, last turn I had 2 apples and ate one, so now 3 apples and body length 4).\n- Actually, the state says \"Apples collected: 3\" for my snake, which matches: I started with 2, ate one last turn, so now 3.\n\nApples at: (7,2), (1,1), (5,2), (0,3), (0,5)\n\nEnemy snake #1: head at (3,6), body [(2,6)], apples collected: 1.\n\nPossible moves from my head (8,6):\n- UP: (8,7) - this is my body (the first segment). So moving UP would hit my own body and die.\n- DOWN: (8,5) - within board? Yes. Check if occupied: board shows row 5, column 8 is '.' (empty). Also, not in my body: my body is at (8,7), (7,7), (7,8). So safe.\n- LEFT: (7,6) - within board. Check board: row 6, column 7 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - within board. Check board: row 6, column 9 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nSo UP is unsafe (immediate death). DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, benefits:\n- DOWN (8,5): moves away from the current area. There are no apples directly nearby in that direction. But it might open paths to lower apples like (7,2) or (5,2).\n- LEFT (7,6): moves towards the center. From (7,6), I can potentially go down to (7,5) etc. to reach apples at (7,2) or (5,2).\n- RIGHT (9,6): moves to the edge. This might limit future moves (only 3 directions from there, and one is back into body).\n\nAlso, consider enemy snake at (3,6). It might move towards the apples on the left (like (1,1)) or up/down. It is not an immediate threat.\n\nI should avoid going RIGHT to (9,6) because it is a dead-end and reduces options. Better to go LEFT or DOWN to have more flexibility.\n\nLooking at apples: the closest apples are (7,2) and (5,2). Moving LEFT to (7,6) is a step towards that direction (then I can go down to (7,5), (7,4), etc.). DOWN to (8,5) is also a step down, but then I might need to go left later.\n\nLEFT seems slightly better because it is directly towards the apples. Also, from (7,6), I have three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT? But UP is (7,7) which is my body, so only DOWN and RIGHT? Actually, from (7,6):\n- UP: (7,7) - body, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (7,5) - safe.\n- LEFT: (6,6) - safe.\n- RIGHT: (8,6) - but that is my current head? Actually, no: (8,6) is my head now, but after moving, it will be body. So moving LEFT to (7,6) and then next turn, (8,6) becomes body. So from (7,6), UP is body (7,7), DOWN is (7,5) safe, LEFT is (6,6) safe, RIGHT is (8,6) which will be body (so unsafe). So only two moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\nSimilarly, if I go DOWN to (8,5):\n- UP: (8,6) - body (unsafe)\n- DOWN: (8,4) - safe\n- LEFT: (7,5) - safe\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - safe\nSo three moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, going DOWN to (8,5) gives more options (3 moves) than going LEFT to (7,6) (only 2 moves). Also, going DOWN avoids the immediate body above.\n\nMoreover, going DOWN is a step towards the apples at (7,2) and (5,2) (which are below). So DOWN is preferable.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (8,5), I can then consider moving LEFT to (7,5) and then down to (7,4), etc. to reach the apples. Also, note the apple at (0,5) is at the same row, but far left. I might need to avoid the enemy snake which is moving in the left area.\n\nSo for this turn, DOWN is the best move to maintain flexibility and move towards apples.\n\nDOWN",

Alternatively, I could go further left to (6,5), etc. to reach (5,2).\n\nLEFT seems optimal for both direction and flexibility (3 safe moves next turn).\n\nSo, choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Now I have 5 apples and my body is [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] (length 6). The tail is at (7,5).\n- Apples available: (1,1), (0,3), (1,4), (0,1), (6,7) [Note: (5,2) was eaten last turn]\n- Enemy snake #1: head at (1,5), body [(1,6), (0,6)], apples: 2.\n\nPossible moves from my head (5,2):\n- UP: (5,3) - within board.

Check: row 2, column 6 is my body (first segment). Unsafe (would hit myself).\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe (immediate death). UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, consider apples:\n- (1,1) is southwest, (0,3) and (0,1) are west, (1,4) is northwest, (6,7) is northeast.\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,5) and might be heading towards (1,4) or (0,3). It is not a direct threat to me currently.\n\nFrom (5,2):\n- Moving LEFT (to (4,2)) gets me closer to the apples on the left (0,3), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,4)).\n- Moving DOWN (to (5,1)) also gets me closer to (1,1) and (0,1).\n- Moving UP (to (5,3)) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately, but might be part of a path to (6,7) or (1,4).\n\nLong-term plan: I should head towards the cluster of apples on the left (0,3), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,4)). Enemy snake #1 is also in that area, so I need to be cautious. However, I have a length advantage (6 vs 3) and can potentially block or outmaneuver it.\n\nAvoid moving RIGHT (backwards) as it is unsafe. Also, my tail is at (7,5), so after this move, my tail will move forward (since I ate an apple last turn, I grew, so the tail stays put this turn? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow immediately, but the tail doesn't move until the next move without eating. So after moving LEFT to (5,2) and eating, my body became 6 segments. Now when I move, the tail will move (unless I eat again). So after this move, the tail will advance from (7,5) to (7,4) or similar? Actually, the entire body shifts: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So after moving from (5,2), the next body segment will be (5,2) [old head], then (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), and the tail (7,5) is lost. So the new body will be [new head, (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)].\n\nSo moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe and progresses towards the left apples. DOWN to (5,1) is also good. UP to (5,3) is safe but less directed.\n\nI think LEFT or DOWN are both good. To be more efficient, LEFT (to (4,2)) is directly west, which is the general direction of multiple apples. Then from there, I can go DOWN to (4,1) or LEFT to (3,2), etc.\n\nChoose LEFT to continue towards the apple cluster.\n\nLEFT\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMoved LEFT to (5,2) last turn and ate apple.

Enemy snake #1 at (1,5) might compete for (1,4) or (0,3). Plan: move LEFT to (4,2) this turn, then consider DOWN to (4,1) or LEFT to (3,2) next to approach (1,1) and (0,1).

Check: row 3, col 4 is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,1) - Within board. Check: row 1, col 4 is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body.

Unsafe (would hit myself).\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nApples analysis:\n- (1,1) is southwest - distance 3 (Manhattan: |4-1| + |2-1| = 3+1=4)\n- (0,3) is west - distance 4 (|4-0| + |2-3| = 4+1=5)\n- (0,1) is southwest - distance 4 (|4-0| + |2-1| = 4+1=5)\n- (6,7) is northeast - distance 5 (|4-6| + |2-7| = 2+5=7)\n- (5,9) is north - distance 5 (|4-5| + |2-9| = 1+7=8)\n\nThe closest apple is (1,1) (Manhattan distance 4). Moving DOWN to (4,1) reduces the distance to (1,1) to 3 (|4-1| + |1-1| = 3+0=3). Moving LEFT to (3,2) reduces distance to (1,1) to 3 (|3-1| + |2-1| = 2+1=3). Moving UP doesn't help directly.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,4) and might be heading towards (0,3) or (1,1). I have a length advantage (6 vs 4) and can potentially block it.\n\nI should prioritize getting to (1,1) before the enemy. Both DOWN and LEFT are good for this. DOWN (to (4,1)) is slightly better because it gets me to y=1 (same row as (1,1)), and I can then go LEFT to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).\n\nFuture safety: After moving DOWN to (4,1), my next moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? From (4,1):\n- UP: (4,2) - will be empty (my current head moves)\n- DOWN: (4,0) - within board\n- LEFT: (3,1) - within board\n- RIGHT: (5,1) - within board\nAll should be safe next turn.\n\nSimilarly, moving LEFT to (3,2) also keeps options open.\n\nBut DOWN is more direct towards (1,1). Also, the apple at (0,1) is nearby.\n\nI'll choose DOWN to get closer to the apple cluster and maintain flexibility.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMoved LEFT last turn to (4,2). Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT unsafe. Heading towards apple (1,1) (distance 4). Moving DOWN to (4,1) reduces distance to (1,1) to 3. Also positions me for (0,1). Enemy at (1,4) might compete for (1,1) or (0,3). With length advantage (6 vs 4), I can block. Plan: move DOWN to (4,1), then LEFT to (3,1) next turn to approach (1,1). Avoid moving into enemy path directly.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nApples analysis:\n- (1,1) is west - distance 2 (Manhattan: |3-1| + |1-1| = 2+0=2)\n- (0,1) is west - distance 3 (|3-0| + |1-1| = 3+0=3)\n- (2,3) is northwest - distance 3 (|3-2| + |1-3| = 1+2=3)\n- (6,7) is northeast - distance 9 (|3-6| + |1-7| = 3+6=9)\n- (5,9) is north - distance 10 (|3-5| + |1-9| = 2+8=10)\n\nThe closest apples are (1,1), (0,1), and (2,3). Moving LEFT to (2,1) reduces distance to (1,1) to 1 and (0,1) to 2. Moving UP to (3,2) reduces distance to (2,3) to 2 (|3-2| + |2-3| = 1+1=2). Moving DOWN to (3,0) doesn't help directly.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,3) and likely just ate the apple there (since it moved from (0,4) to (0,3) and there was an apple at (0,3)). It might now be considering (1,1) or (0,1). I need to reach (1,1) before it does.\n\nFrom (0,3), enemy can move:\n- UP: (0,4) - its own body, unsafe\n- DOWN: (0,2) - empty\n- LEFT: (-1,3) - off board, unsafe\n- RIGHT: (1,3) - empty\n\nSo enemy can only go DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3). From (0,2), it could go DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2). From (1,3), it could go DOWN to (1,2) or LEFT to (0,3) (body) or RIGHT to (2,3) (apple).\n\nI should prioritize securing (1,1). Moving LEFT to (2,1) gets me one step away from (1,1). Next turn, I can go LEFT to (1,1) to eat the apple, unless the enemy blocks me.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (0,2), it could then go to (0,1) or (1,2). If it goes RIGHT to (1,3), it could go to (1,2) or (2,3). I need to be cautious of potential head-on collisions.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,1) is the most direct path to (1,1). From there, I can assess next turn whether (1,1) is safe to enter.\n\nUP to (3,2) is also safe and gets me closer to (2,3), but (1,1) is closer and I have a better chance to secure it first.\n\nDOWN to (3,0) is safe but doesn't help immediately.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Secure (1,1) next turn. Move LEFT to (2,1) now. Then if (1,1) is clear (no enemy head adjacent), go LEFT to (1,1) to eat the apple. If enemy is threatening (1,1), consider alternative paths like DOWN to (2,0) or UP to (2,2) to avoid collision and target (0,1) or (2,3).\n\nLEFT",

This increases my score to 6 apples, extending my lead over snake #1 (4 apples).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,3). From there, it can move:\n- UP: (1,4) - its own body, unsafe\n- DOWN: (1,2) - empty\n- LEFT: (0,3) - its own body, unsafe\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - apple (safe)\n\nSo enemy can only go DOWN to (1,2) or RIGHT to (2,3).

There is no risk of head-on collision with enemy #1 this turn because it cannot reach (1,1) in one move from (1,3) (only to (1,2) or (2,3)).\n\nAfter eating (1,1), my new head will be at (1,1) and my tail will grow, so my body will be [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] (length 7). From (1,1), I can consider next moves toward (0,1) or other apples.\n\nUP and DOWN are also safe but miss the immediate opportunity to eat (1,1).

But we need to update based on the board state.\n\nFrom the board state provided for Turn 16:\n- The board shows at row 1, col 1: '0' (my head), and at row 1, col 2: '1' (enemy head). So enemy snake #1 has moved to (1,2). This means it moved DOWN from (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nSo enemy #1 head is at (1,2) with body [(1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4)] (length 4). It did not eat an apple this turn (since (1,2) had no apple).\n\nNow, from my head at (1,1), possible moves:\n- UP: (1,2) - This is the enemy head (snake #1). Moving here would cause a head-on collision (both heads to same cell) and both die. Unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,0) - Within board. Check: row 0, col 1 is '.' (empty). Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,1) - Within board. Check: row 1, col 0 is 'A' (apple). Safe to move onto apple (will grow).\n- RIGHT: (2,1) - Within board. Check: row 1, col 2 is my body segment (second segment). Unsafe (would hit myself).\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are unsafe. Only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nApples analysis:\n- (0,1) is adjacent west - can eat it by moving LEFT.\n- (1,6) is north - distance 5 (|1-1| + |1-6| = 0+5=5)\n- (2,3) is northeast - distance 3 (|1-2| + |1-3| = 1+2=3)\n- (6,7) and (5,9) are far.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,1) lets me eat the apple immediately, growing to length 8. This increases my score to 7 apples, further extending my lead.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,2). From there, it can move:\n- UP: (1,3) - its own body, unsafe\n- DOWN: (1,1) - my head (but I would be moving away, so not an issue if I move LEFT or DOWN)\n- LEFT: (0,2) - empty\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - empty\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2), or RIGHT to (2,2). It cannot go UP.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,1), I am safe from enemy moves because:\n- Enemy moving DOWN to (1,1) would not collide with me (I'm at (0,1)).\n- Enemy moving LEFT to (0,2) is adjacent horizontally, but not same cell.\n- Enemy moving RIGHT to (2,2) is away.\n\nThere is no risk of head-on collision this turn if I move LEFT.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1,0) is safe but misses the immediate apple at (0,1). However, it might be a backup if LEFT is risky? But LEFT is safe.\n\nAfter eating (0,1), my new head will be at (0,1) and my body grows to length 8. From (0,1), I can consider next moves: UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0) (if available). But note enemy might be at (0,2) next turn if it moves LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (0,1), assess from (0,1). If enemy moves to (0,2), avoid head-on collision by going DOWN to (0,0) if safe. Alternatively, consider moving toward other apples like (2,3) or (1,6). With my length advantage (8 vs 4), I should avoid risky encounters and focus on eating apples safely.\n\nLEFT is the best move to secure the apple and increase my lead.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current state:\n\n**Current Turn 17**\n- My head is at (0,1) after moving LEFT and eating the apple at (0,1). My body is now [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] (length 8).\n- Apples remaining: (6,7), (5,9), (2,3), (1,6), (6,6)\n- Enemy snake #1: head at (1,2) with body [(1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4)] (length 4).\n\nFrom my head at (0,1), possible moves:\n- UP: (0,2) - Check: row 2, col 0. Board shows at (0,2): '.' (empty). However, enemy snake #1 might move here? But we must consider current board state and safety.\n- DOWN: (0,0) - Within board. Check: row 0, col 0 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,1) - Off the board (x < 0). Dies immediately. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,1) - Within board. Check: row 1, col 1 is my body segment (second segment). Unsafe (would hit myself).\n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT are unsafe. Only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #1 at (1,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (1,3) - its own body, unsafe.\n- DOWN: (1,1) - my body segment (second segment), unsafe for enemy.\n- LEFT: (0,2) - empty.\n- RIGHT: (2,2) - empty.\n\nSo enemy can go LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2). It cannot go UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,2), and enemy moves LEFT to (0,2), we have a head-on collision (both die). This is risky.\nIf I move DOWN to (0,0), it is safe regardless of enemy move.\n\nApples analysis:\n- (1,6) is north - distance 5 (|0-1| + |1-6| = 1+5=6)\n- (2,3) is northeast - distance 4 (|0-2| + |1-3| = 2+2=4)\n- (6,7) and (5,9) are far.\n- (6,6) is also far.\n\nMoving UP to (0,2) has a risk of head-on collision if enemy chooses LEFT. Since enemy has two safe moves (LEFT and RIGHT), and no immediate apple incentive to choose LEFT (apples are at (2,3), (1,6), etc.), it might choose either. However, (0,2) is empty and safe for enemy, so it might go there. Given my length advantage (8 vs 4), I should avoid risky encounters.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0,0) is completely safe. From (0,0), I can consider next moves: UP to (0,1) (my body) or RIGHT to (1,0) (which is empty). So only RIGHT would be safe next turn. This is a bit limiting, but safe.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, I should work my way toward the apples at (2,3) or (1,6). With my long body, I need to avoid trapping myself. From (0,0), moving RIGHT to (1,0) next turn would be safe. Then from (1,0), I can go UP to (1,1) (body) or RIGHT to (2,0) (empty) or DOWN to (1,-1) invalid. So RIGHT to (2,0) is possible. Then continue east/north toward (2,3).\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP and avoid collision, I could go from (0,2) to (0,3) or (1,2) (enemy head, unsafe) or (0,1) (body). So only UP to (0,3) might be safe. But (0,3) is enemy body (snake #1 segment), so unsafe. So from (0,2), only DOWN would be safe next turn (back to (0,1), which is body). So moving UP leads to a dead-end next turn unless enemy dies.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is risky both for collision and for next moves. Moving DOWN is safe and keeps me alive.\n\nChoose DOWN to (0,0).\n\nDOWN",

Let me re-examine the board state and my body coordinates more carefully.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Row 2: \"1 T . . T T T . . .\" - My head (1) is at (0, 2)\n- My body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n\nSo from head at (0, 2):\n- **LEFT**: (-1, 2) - Off board, **DEAD**\n- **RIGHT**: (1, 2) - Contains my body segment, **DEAD**\n- **UP**: (0, 3) - Contains my body segment, **DEAD**\n- **DOWN**: (0, 1) - **Safe!**\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Snake #0 head at (0, 1), body [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)]\n- Enemy can move: UP (0, 2) - where I am now, LEFT (-1, 1), DOWN (0, 0), RIGHT (1, 1)\n\n**Critical collision risk:**\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 1) and snake #0 moves UP to (0, 2), we would swap positions harmlessly.\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 1) and snake #0 stays at (0, 1) or moves elsewhere, I might be safe.\n\nWait - I need to reconsider this more carefully. If snake #0's head is at (0, 1) and I move DOWN to (0, 1), we would have a head-on collision since both heads would occupy (0, 1) simultaneously. **This would kill both of us!**\n\n**Re-evaluating moves:**\nLet me check if any move is actually safe considering the enemy snake's potential moves.\n\nGiven that I'm at (0, 2) with only DOWN being apparently safe, but DOWN leads to (0, 1) where snake #0's head currently is...\n\nIf snake #0 moves away from (0, 1), then (0, 1) becomes safe.\nIf snake #0 stays at (0, 1) or moves toward me, then (0, 1) is dangerous.\n\nSince I have no other safe moves (LEFT off board, RIGHT/UP into my body), I must gamble that the enemy will move away from (0, 1). The most likely move for snake #0 would be UP to (0, 2) or RIGHT to (1, 1), both avoiding (0, 1).\n\n**Strategic plan:**\nGiven my extremely constrained position with only one theoretically safe move, I must take DOWN and hope snake #0 moves away from (0, 1). This is risky but necessary.\n\nDOWN",
