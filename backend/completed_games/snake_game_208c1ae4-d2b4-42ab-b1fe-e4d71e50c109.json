I also don't want to go backwards, so I'll try to move towards the apple while avoiding any potential obstacles.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move diagonally down and to the left, which will bring me closer to the apple while also giving me some flexibility to adjust my direction if needed.\n\nNext move: DOWN LEFT.\n\nI'll keep an eye on the enemy snakes and adjust my strategy accordingly. My next move will depend on the board state and the positions of the other snakes.\n\nNext turn strategy: I'll continue to move towards the apple at (4, 1) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake at (1, 8). If I can get close enough, I might try to make a sharp turn to get to the apple quickly.\n\nNext move: DOWN LEFT.\n\nMy decided next move is: DOWN LEFT."
