          "rationale": "The current state shows my snake (ID 0) at (7, 5) and an enemy snake (ID 1) at (8, 6).\nThe board is 10x10.\nApples are at: (0, 6), (1, 5), (7, 7), (4, 4), (9, 0).\n\nMy immediate goal is to eat an apple safely. The closest apple is at (7, 7).\n\nLet's analyze possible moves:\n\n**My position:** (7, 5)\n\n1. **UP to (7, 6):**\n   * Safe: (7, 6) is on the board and contains no snake segments currently.\n   * Proximity to apple: Moves closer to (7, 7).\n   * Enemy interaction: Snake 1 is at (8, 6). If Snake 1 moves LEFT, it goes to (7, 6), resulting in a head-on collision. If Snake 1 moves UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, it avoids collision. Since the enemy is positioned slightly above and to the right of me, a LEFT move by them is plausible to go for the apple at (7, 7) or (9, 0) or even (4, 4). This move is risky due to the potential collision with Snake 1.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n   * Safe: (7, 4) is on the board and clear.\n   * Proximity to apple: Moves away from (7, 7) but potentially towards (4, 4).\n   * Enemy interaction: No immediate collision risk.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n   * Safe: (6, 5) is on the board and clear.\n   * Proximity to apple: Moves away from (7, 7). Keeps options open towards (4, 4).\n   * Enemy interaction: No immediate collision risk.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n   * Safe: (8, 5) is on the board and clear.\n   * Proximity to apple: Doesn't move towards (7, 7) or (4, 4) optimally.\n   * Enemy interaction: If Snake 1 moves DOWN from (8, 6) it lands on (8, 5), resulting in a head-on collision. This is also risky.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n* UP (to (7, 6)): Collision risk if Snake 1 (8, 6) moves LEFT. Snake 1 might move LEFT to get to (7, 7) or move DOWN/RIGHT/UP.\n* RIGHT (to (8, 5)): Collision risk if Snake 1 (8, 6) moves DOWN. Snake 1 might move DOWN to get to the lower quadrant apples, or stay high for (7, 7).\n\nThe closest and most attractive apple is (7, 7). To get there in two turns, I need to move UP twice.\n\nLet's consider Snake 1's possible moves from (8, 6) if it's aiming for (7, 7):\n* Snake 1 moves UP to (8, 7). Safe from me, but further from (7, 7) in Y coordinate sense if it needs to move X=7.\n* Snake 1 moves LEFT to (7, 6). This is a conflict if I move UP to (7, 6).\n* Snake 1 moves DOWN to (8, 5). This is a conflict if I move RIGHT to (8, 5).\n\nSince my snake is currently at (7, 5), and the apple (7, 7) is directly North, moving UP seems like the most direct path.\n\nIf Snake 1 is greedy for (7, 7), it is likely to try to move toward (7, Y). Moving LEFT to (7, 6) is a strong possibility for Snake 1.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 6), there is a significant risk of a head-on collision at (7, 6).\n\nWhat if I prioritize safety and the next nearest apple (4, 4)?\nMoving DOWN to (7, 4) or LEFT to (6, 5) are safe initial moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 4):\nNext turn I can move LEFT to (6, 4) or DOWN to (7, 3). This is a long path to (4, 4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 5):\nNext turn I can move LEFT to (5, 5) (closer to (4, 4)) or DOWN to (6, 4). This also looks like a long path.\n\nGiven the immediate vicinity of (7, 7), if I can calculate the risk for UP accurately, it might be worth it. Snake 1 (8, 6) is further from (7, 7) in the X dimension than I am in the Y dimension (I am 2 tiles away, S1 is 3 tiles away currently, moving diagonally).\n\nIf Snake 1 moves LEFT to (7, 6) (collision with my UP move), they put themselves on a path to (7, 7).\nIf Snake 1 moves UP to (8, 7), they are aiming for (7, 7) by turning LEFT next/later, or potentially aiming for the top edge.\nIf Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (9, 6), they are aiming for (9, 0) or the edge.\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (8, 5), they are moving away from (7, 7).\n\nSince the enemy snake is already further right, they might view going for (7, 7) via a path that minimizes turning/risk, like UP and then LEFT, or diagonally LEFT a bit.\n\nThere are also apples at (0, 6) and (1, 5). Moving LEFT would put me closer to those too.\n\nLet's assume the opponent is also rational and highly values (7, 7).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 6), and I move UP to (7, 6), we collide.\nIf S1 moves UP to (8, 7), and I move UP to (7, 6), I gain position for (7, 7).\n\nBecause it is turn 0 and both snakes are size 1, there is a strong incentive to take the closest apple (7, 7). A collision is highly likely when both snakes want the same valuable target and are close.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 5), I avoid collision risk and put myself on a path towards (4, 4) (4 moves away) and (1, 5) (5 moves away).\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 4), I avoid collision risk and put myself on a path towards (4, 4) (4 moves away).\n\nIf I move LEFT, what happens to Snake 1?\nIf S1 takes (7, 7), good for them.\nS1 is at (8, 6). If they move LEFT to (7, 6) or UP to (8, 7) they aim for (7, 7).\n\nIf I choose a defensive, safe move like LEFT:\nMy position: (6, 5).\nIf S1 moves LEFT: (7, 6).\nIf S1 moves UP: (8, 7).\nS1 is now positioned for (7, 7) or maybe going high. I am safe and can aim for (4, 4) or (1, 5).\n\nGiven the high risk of head-on collision if both snakes aggressively pursue (7, 7), choosing a less contested apple or pathway seems prudent for the first move. (4, 4) is reachable relatively quickly.\n\nLet's prioritize (4, 4).\nFrom (7, 5), moving LEFT once to (6, 5) and then DOWN/LEFT seems like a solid, safe start.\n\nPath to (4, 4) via LEFT: (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4). 4 moves.\nPath to (4, 4) via DOWN: (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4). 4 moves.\n\nMoving LEFT (to (6, 5)) keeps me closer to the left side apples (0, 6) and (1, 5) as well.\n\nI will choose LEFT to minimize immediate collision risk while setting up for (4, 4).\n\nLong-term plan: Secure (4, 4). After that, assess if (1, 5) or (0, 6) are safer than the remaining top-right apples (if S1 hasn't gotten them).\n\n**Pre-computation check for LEFT move (to 6, 5):**\n1. Off board? No.\n2. Self-collision? No body segments.\n3. Enemy body collision? No body segments.\n4. Head collision? Snake 1 is at (8, 6). Even if S1 moves furthest right (RIGHT to (9, 6)) or furthest down (DOWN to (8, 5)) or furthest up (UP to (8, 7)) or furthest left (LEFT to (7, 6)), none of these positions conflict with my destination (6, 5).\n\nLEFT is a safe move.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 7).\n\nApples are at: (0, 6), (1, 5), (7, 7), (4, 4), (9, 0).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, moving me from (7, 5) to (6, 5), prioritizing safety over directly contesting the closest apple (7, 7).\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\nMy Head: (6, 5).\nEnemy Head (S1): (8, 7).\nClosest apples to me: (4, 4) (3 moves minimum), (1, 5) (5 moves minimum), (7, 7) (3 moves minimum).\n\n1. **Targeting (4, 4):**\n   * Path: (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4). (3 moves required: LEFT, DOWN, LEFT).\n   * Path: (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4).

(3 moves required: RIGHT, UP, UP).\n\nConsidering possible moves from (6, 5):\n\n*   **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Leads towards (0, 6) (5 moves) or (7, 7) (4 moves). Not optimal for (4, 4).\n    *   No immediate threat from S1 (8, 7).\n\n*   **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Excellent for (4, 4). Next moves: (5, 4) then (4, 4). (2 moves remaining to apple).\n    *   No immediate threat from S1.\n\n*   **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Excellent for (4, 4). Next moves: (5, 4) or (4, 5). (2 or 3 moves remaining to apple). It also brings me closer to (1, 5).\n    *   No immediate threat from S1.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Moves directly back toward the contested area for (7, 7). From (7, 5), I am two moves from (7, 7).\n    *   S1 is at (8, 7). If S1 moved LEFT last turn, they are at (7, 7) now (Apple consumed). If S1 moved UP/RIGHT/DOWN, they are elsewhere.\n\nLet's assume S1 went for (7, 7) aggressively last turn from (8, 7).\nCase A: S1 moved LEFT to (7, 7). S1 has the apple. (7, 7) is empty now, S1 is size 2.\nCase B: S1 moved DOWN to (8, 6). S1 is 1 move away from hitting S0 if S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 5) and S1 moves LEFT to (7, 6) combined with S0 moving UP to (7, 6).\nCase C: S1 moved UP to (8, 8). S1 is further from (7, 7) but aiming high.\nCase D: S1 moved RIGHT to (9, 7). S1 is aiming high/right.\n\nI need to confirm S1's last move. The provided information *only* shows the current state (Turn 1) and *my* last move (LEFT, which means I moved from an implied (7, 5) in Turn 0 startup to (6, 5) in Turn 1). I do not know S1's move in Turn 0.\n\nLet's analyze the new board state based on the current coordinates:\nMy Head: (6, 5)\nS1 Head: (8, 7)\nApple (7, 7) is still there.\n\nThis means S1 did **not** just move from (7, 7) or eat the apple. If S1 was at (8, 7) *after* my move, then their previous position (Turn 0 start) was one step away, OR they were already at (8, 7) and ate an apple there, OR the listed starting positions were given for Turn 0 and this is the result of turn 0 moves.\n\nThe input states:\nTurn: 1 / 150\nYour snake (ID: 0): Head: (6, 5)\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 - Head: (8, 7)\nApples at: (7, 7) is present.\n\nThis means that in Turn 0, my snake moved from its initial position (which must have been (7, 5) since my move was LEFT to get to (6, 5) based on the implicit starting positions often used in these problems or the pre-turn rationale) to (6, 5).\n\nS1 started at (8, 7) (if we assume the initial state listed in the previous rationale or context was the true start of Turn 0: S0 at (7, 5), S1 at (8, 6)).\nWait, the initial state provided *before* my last move rationale showed:\nS0 Head: (6, 5)\nS1 Head: (8, 7)\nThis suggests the previous rationale was based on a misunderstanding of coordinates, or the system provided coordinates for the START of the turn, *before* $S0$ executed the requested move.\n\nLet's strictly use the provided information for **Turn 1**:\nS0 Head: (6, 5). S0 Body: none.\nS1 Head: (8, 7). S1 Body: none.\nApple at (7, 7) is present.\n\nThis means that wherever S1 moved from in Turn 0, they ended up at (8, 7) and did not capture (7, 7).\nIf S1 started at (8, 6) in Turn 0 (as hypothesized in my previous rationale), S1 moved UP to (8, 7). This is a safe move that aims high.\n\nS0 is at (6, 5). S1 is at (8, 7). Apple (7, 7) is still unclaimed.\n\n**Re-evaluating objectives from (6, 5):**\n\n1. **Go for (4, 4):** Requires 3 moves (e.g., DOWN, LEFT, LEFT). Safe path.\n2. **Go for (7, 7):** Requires 3 moves (e.g., RIGHT, UP, UP). Very contested path.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5).\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 7) (captures apple).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (8, 6).\n\nIf S1 continues to aim for (7, 7), they are likely to move towards (7, Y).\nFrom (8, 7), S1's best moves for (7, 7) are LEFT (to 7, 7, takes apple) or DOWN (to 8, 6) then LEFT/UP.\n\n**Scenario 1: S1 moves LEFT to (7, 7) and gets the apple.**\nMy move RIGHT to (7, 5) would be safe. I can then aim for other apples.\n\n**Scenario 2: S1 moves DOWN to (8, 6).**\nMy move RIGHT to (7, 5) is safe. I am closer to (7, 7)'s initial position, but (7, 7) is still there. If I move UP next turn to (7, 6) and S1 moves LEFT to (7, 6), we collide. Risky.\n\nGiven that S1 is currently at (8, 7) and (7, 7) is an available apple, there is a very high probability S1 moves LEFT this turn to capture the apple, winning the short race to growth. Since I am 3 steps away, I cannot intercept.\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (7, 7), I should pivot to a guaranteed apple. (4, 4) is 3 safe moves away.\n\nLet's choose the safe route towards (4, 4): DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Move DOWN to (6, 4):**\n(6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4). (2 more moves). This is optimal.\n\n**Move LEFT to (5, 5):**\n(5, 5) -> (5, 4) or (4, 5). If (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4). (2 more moves). Also optimal.\n\nLEFT (to 5, 5) also positions me well for (1, 5) (4 moves away) and (0, 6) (6 moves away) which are near the edge and less likely to be contested by S1 who is far right.\nDOWN (to 6, 4) is slightly more conservative to the bottom of the board but also perfectly fine for (4, 4).\n\nI prefer LEFT (to 5, 5) as it keeps the overall options open towards multiple Western apples.\n\nCheck for safety of LEFT (to 5, 5):\n1. Off board? No.\n2. Self-collision? No.\n3. Enemy body collision? No bodies.\n4. Head collision? S1 is at (8, 7). No path leads S1 to (5, 5).\n\nLEFT is a safe and strategic move, aiming for (4, 4) and keeping Western apples viable.\n\nMy short-term plan is to secure (4, 4) in the next 2 turns. If S1 takes (7, 7), I will have also grown and maintained a safe position.\n\nLEFT",

(Next step is (4, 4) via LEFT). **1 move closer to (4, 4).**\n    *   A collision with S1 is extremely unlikely.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safe. (Next step is (4, 4) via DOWN, or (1, 5) via LEFT*3).\n    *   1 move closer to (4, 4).\n    *   Also positions well for (1, 5).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves back where I came from. Does not advance.\n    *   Moves away from (4, 4).\n\n**Optimal path to (4, 4):**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT bring me one step closer and are equally efficient for the short term goal of (4, 4).\n\n*   Option D: (5, 5) -> DOWN (5, 4). Next: LEFT (4, 4). (2 moves total)\n*   Option L: (5, 5) -> LEFT (4, 5). Next: DOWN (4, 4). (2 moves total)\n\nI will choose **DOWN** to (5, 4). This places me directly above the optimal second move to (4, 4), and slightly further minimizes potential interaction with S1, who is focused on the right side of the board.\n\n**Collision/Contest Check:**\nS1 is at (8, 6). S1's primary targets are (7, 7) (3 moves minimum: L, U, U) or (9, 0) (2 moves minimum: R, D).\n\nPossible S1 moves this turn:\n*   RIGHT to (9, 6): Aims for (9, 0). My move DOWN is safe.\n*   LEFT to (7, 6): Aims for (7, 7). My move DOWN is safe.\n*   UP to (8, 7): Backtracking slightly. My move DOWN is safe.\n*   DOWN to (8, 5): Still aiming for (9, 0) possibly. My move DOWN is safe.\n\nNo move I make poses an immediate threat to S1, and no move S1 makes poses an immediate direct threat to me. Securing (4, 4) is the priority.\n\nChoosing DOWN to (5, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Body: none.\n\nApples at: (0, 6), (1, 5), (7, 7), (9, 0), (8, 4).\n\nMy current goal, set in the last turn, is to collect the apple at (1, 5).\n\n**Goal Path Check (Target (1, 5)):**\n*   Current position (2, 4).\n*   Manhattan distance to (1, 5) is |2-1| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n*   The previous plan was: (2, 4) -> LEFT to (1, 4) -> UP to (1, 5).\n\n**Enemy Movement Analysis (Snake 1):**\nS1 is at (9, 9). This is the top right corner.\nS1 is short (Length 1).\nPossible moves for S1: DOWN to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 9).\nIf S1 targets (7, 7) (MD 4), it might move LEFT.\nIf S1 targets (8, 4) (MD 5), it might move DOWN first.\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (8, 9), it is 2 moves from (7, 7).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (9, 8), it is 3 moves from (7, 7).\n\nS1 is far away and poses no immediate threat to my path or target.\n\n**My Possible Moves from (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):**\n    *   Safe. MD to (1, 5) is 1 (LEFT). This is a good move.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):**\n    *   Safe. MD to (1, 5) is 3. Moving away from the target.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 4):**\n    *   Safe. MD to (1, 5) is 1 (UP). This is the planned move and also moves adjacent to the target.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):**\n    *   **FATAL:** Collision with my body segment at (3, 4).\n\n**Choosing the Move:**\n\nI have two excellent moves: UP to (2, 5) and LEFT to (1, 4). Both place me 1 move away from the apple at (1, 5).\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (1, 4): Next turn, I move UP to (1, 5) and collect the apple.\n*   If I move UP to (2, 5): Next turn, I move LEFT to (1, 5) and collect the apple.\n\nBoth complete the goal in 2 turns and are safe. I will stick to the planned move (LEFT) because it maximizes movement towards the x-coordinate of the apple first, which was the original intention.\n\n**Safety Check:**\nThere are no other snakes close enough to block (1, 5) or cause a head-on collision at (1, 4). My tail segment (3, 4) will move to (2, 4), opening up (3, 4) but not affecting the move to (1, 4).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move LEFT.\n\n**Short-term plan for the next turns (S0 at (1, 4)):**\n1.  Target (1, 5).\n2.  T+1 (Turn 7): Move UP to (1, 5) and collect the apple.\n3.  T+2 (Turn 8): My length will be 3. Head at (1, 5). New goal selection (likely (0, 6) or (7, 7) depending on Snake 1's movement).\n\nLEFT",
