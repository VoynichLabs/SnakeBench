However, this could potentially lead to getting trapped on the edge if not careful.\n\n**RIGHT** moves me toward the center, giving me more flexibility for future moves and keeping me away from the edges. The enemy is at (3, 7) so it's unlikely to collide with me this turn.\n\n**UP** moves me away from the bottom edge, but doesn't particularly help with apple collection.\n\n**DOWN** is unsafe as it would hit my own body.\n\nThe enemy snake is positioned above and to the right of me. It's likely to head toward one of the closer apples like (3, 9) or (8, 6).\n\n## Long-term Strategy\n1. I need to collect more apples to reach the 30 apple win condition\n2. I should avoid getting trapped on the edges\n3. I need to maintain awareness of the enemy's position\n4. I should prioritize moves that keep multiple future options open\n\nGiven the options, **RIGHT** seems like the best move as it:\n- Keeps me safe\n- Moves me toward the center for better flexibility\n- Doesn't immediately commit to the edge strategy\n- Keeps me positioned to respond to the enemy's movements\n\nRIGHT",

This brings me closer to the apple at (5, 5) while keeping a safe distance from the enemy. The enemy is at (5, 9) and I would be moving to (8, 5), maintaining a good buffer zone. Moving DOWN also gives me more options for the next move - I can still go LEFT to get the apple at (5, 5) or RIGHT to get the apple at (9, 9) depending on where the enemy moves.\n\nDOWN",
