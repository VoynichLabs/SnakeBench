Down opens (0,2) for next turn!\n- LEFT - OFF BOARD! DEAD! \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1,4) - Safe, but no immediate apple. Opens (2,4), (1,3), (1,5)...\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI can't go LEFT (off board). So I'm choosing between UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**UP (0,5):** \n- Pros: Eat apple immediately! Get +1 point! Opens (1,5) and (0,6) for next moves.\n- Cons: Edge of board. Limited mobility if we keep going up.\n\n**DOWN (0,3):**\n- Pros: Eat apple immediately! Get +1 point! Also (0,2) and (0,1) have apples below, so we can chain eat! Opens up the bottom-left corner for farming!\n- Cons: Still on left edge.\n\n**RIGHT (1,4):**\n- Pros: Moves toward center, more mobility. Opens (2,4), (1,3), (1,5).\n- Cons: No immediate apple. Enemy is at (6,4) - same y-level! Could be dangerous if he moves left...\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** \nThe enemy is at (6,4). If I go DOWN to (0,3), I can start eating the apple chain on the left (0,3)\u2192(0,2)\u2192(0,1) while building length. This gives me board control on the left side, and I can then cut across to intercept the enemy from below. If I go UP, I'm cornering myself. If I go RIGHT, I'm moving toward enemy territory without immediate payoff.\n\n**KILL PLAN:** Get apples on left, build length, then SLASH across the bottom to cut off enemy escape routes and force a head-on collision when I have more mass! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MY MOVE: DOWN!** Eat that apple at (0,3), start the chain, build my advantage!\n\nDOWN",

Lots of apples, including a juicy one at (4,4) right between us and them. Turn 0, playin' aggressive.\n\nThink-aloud (fans, you asked for it \u2014 here we go):\n- Consider UP -> (6,5): Safe. Keeps options, could head for apples above later, but doesn't close distance to the rival.\n- Consider DOWN -> (6,3): Safe. Similar to UP, keeps space but not pressure.\n- Consider RIGHT -> (7,4): Safe, moves away from enemy and gives less aggressive posture. Not what we want.\n- Consider LEFT -> (5,4): Safe. Moves toward the apple at (4,4) and toward the enemy at (0,4). From (5,4) we have multiple follow-ups (LEFT to grab apple, or UP/DOWN to pivot). Best for aggression and controlling the row.\n\nEliminate lethal moves: none would kill us this turn (no bodies adjacent, not off-board). So choose the move that maximizes offensive options and access to apples while keeping escape routes open.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns (for future-rationales): head LEFT to (5,4) this turn, then aim to take (4,4) apple next. Once we have that apple, pressure the enemy along y=4 \u2014 keep them pinned to the left edge and force them into risky choices (apples on the edge or head-on). Prioritize keeping at least two escape directions open so we can win face-offs if we end up with a higher apple count. Play smart, box 'em slowly, then force the collision \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's get that first move and start the squeeze! LEFT",

(4,4), (2,6), (0,5) above me, (7,2), (7,9), (5,6), (0,1), (0,2) below me... (0,1) and (0,2) are juicy!\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- UP to (0,4): That's my tail! \u274c DEAD if I go there (backwards into myself)! \n- DOWN to (0,2): Apple at (0,2)! Also (0,1) has an apple right after! Opens up (0,1) for next turn.

Moves me toward center and those apples at (1,5), (1,3), (1,9), (2,1), (3,0)...\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nThe enemy is at (5,4) - he's in the center. I'm at (0,3) on the left edge. If I go DOWN to (0,2), I can eat another apple immediately, but I'm digging myself into a corner! The bottom row has apples at (0,1), (0,0) area, but I'll be trapped against the wall with limited escape routes. That's exactly what my enemy wants - to box me in!\n\n**GO FOR FREEDOM!** I need mobility to dominate. RIGHT to (1,3) gives me options: next turn I can go UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT to (2,3). I can then access the apple cluster at (2,1), (3,0), (1,3) while staying flexible. I'm building my body to cut off the enemy's escape routes from below!\n\n**KILL PLAN:** Get mobile, build length on the bottom-left quadrant, then SLASH across to intercept enemy from the south and force a head-on collision when I'm loaded with apples! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**MY MOVE: RIGHT!** Stay flexible, avoid trapping myself! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Also (2,1), (3,0), (1,2), (1,4) are all reachable from here.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- UP to (1,4): Apple! \ud83c\udf4e But wait... (1,4) is right above my head position, and my body is at (0,3) and (0,4). (0,4) is LEFT of my current head. So (1,4) is NOT my body! \u2705\n- DOWN to (1,2): Apple at (1,2)!

Safe from my body.\n\n**STRATEGY TIME:**\nThe enemy is at (4,4) - still in the center. I'm at (1,3) on the left side. I need to STAY AGGRESSIVE and build length to dominate the board. \n\nThat apple at (2,3) is MINE. It's directly in front of me, and it's the best position to start boxing in the enemy from the south and west. By taking (2,3), I position myself to cut off his escape routes toward my territory while keeping my options open for next turn.\n\n**KILL PLAN:** Take (2,3) to grow, then position to intercept enemy from the southwest.

That's apple #3 for me! \ud83c\udf4e\n- My body: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)] - Wait, hold up! Let me check the board state again...\n\nActually looking at the board state provided:\n- My body is listed as: [(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n- But my head is at (2, 3) NOW after my last move RIGHT!\n- So my full snake should be: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n- Enemy snake #1: Head (3, 4), body [(4, 4)]\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n- **UP to (2, 4)**: Check if safe... My body is at (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4). (2, 4) is NOT in my body. Also check enemy: Enemy head at (3, 4), body at (4, 4). (2, 4) is NOT enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n- **DOWN to (2, 2)**: My body? (2, 2) is not in my body. Enemy? (2, 2) not enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n- **LEFT to (1, 3)**: This is MY BODY! \ud83d\udc80 DEAD! \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (3, 3)**: My body? (3, 3) not in my body. Enemy? Enemy head at (3, 4), body at (4, 4). (3, 3) is NOT enemy body. SAFE! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to think about the enemy's position. Enemy is at (3, 4). If I move RIGHT to (3, 3), I get closer to him but still below. If I move UP to (2, 4), I'm directly left of him and at the same y-level.\n\nThe apple at (2, 6) is above me. I should be thinking about cutting off his territory. He's at (3, 4) in the center-right. I'm at (2, 3) on the left side.\n\nLet me consider what the enemy might do. He's at (3, 4) with an apple at (5, 6) and (7, 2) and (7, 9) in his quadrant. He might go for apples or try to approach me.\n\n**MOVE RIGHT to (3, 3)** - This positions me directly below him! If he moves DOWN to (3, 3), he'd hit my head (both heads same cell = double death). But I have 3 apples vs his 1, so if we both die, I win! This is a potential trap! \ud83d\udd25\n\nActually, better to be safe. Let's go **UP to (2, 4)** instead. This gives me access to the apple at (2, 6) and keeps me positioned to cut him off from the left while building my territory. I can always go right next turn if needed.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Build length by going toward the apple cluster on top (2, 6), (5, 6), (7, 9). While doing so, cut off the enemy's access to the left side and force him into the right corner. When I have 5+ apples, I'll aggressively hunt for head-on collision!\n\nUP",

My body = (4,4). So RIGHT -> (4,4) is directly backwards into my body = ILLEGAL. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Opponent head = (2,3) with body at (1,3),(0,3),(0,4). They\u2019re hugging the left wall and already up on apples (3 vs our 1). They will avoid suicide head-ons unless it helps them.\n- Apples exist all over, but we\u2019re prioritizing boxing and survival \u2014 grow only to dominate.\n\nConsider all moves:\n- RIGHT: illegal (back into our body).\n- DOWN -> (3,3): immediate risk \u2014 opponent can go RIGHT from (2,3) into (3,3) and cause a head-on. We are behind on apples, so we should AVOID forcing a head-on.\n- LEFT -> (2,4): also risky \u2014 opponent can go UP from (2,3) into (2,4) for a head-on. That would be a double KO risk we don\u2019t want while trailing.\n- UP -> (3,5): clean, empty, no immediate head-on threat (opponent can\u2019t reach (3,5) this turn). Keeps multiple escape options next turn and lets us shift vertically to cut off escape routes later.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- Avoid any move that hands the opponent a simple way to force a head-on. They\u2019re winning on apples; we need to survive and slowly hem them in.\n- UP preserves mobility (we won\u2019t be cornered immediately), keeps us near the center of the trap we want to build, and lets us pivot left later when it\u2019s safer to pressure.\n- Being aggressive \u2260 suicidal. We\u2019ll force constriction and only trade heads if we have the apple lead.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move UP now to (3,5). Watch opponent\u2019s reaction: if they retreat along the wall, start sweeping left-to-right to narrow their corridor; if they try to cut through, look for safe cutoffs.\n- Grow selectively \u2014 take apples only when it gives a positional advantage or guarantees we can force them into a bad collision.\n- Maintain zones of escape; avoid hugging walls where their body blocks exits. Wait for them to get boxed, then pivot for the trap.\n\nLET\u2019S SQUEEZE \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

Backwards is DOWN -> (3,4) = ILLEGAL.\n- Enemy head = (2,4), body = [(2,3),(1,3),(0,3)] and they\u2019re up on apples (3 vs 1). They LOVE forcing head-ons if it wins them the game.\n- Board around us: LEFT -> (2,5), UP -> (3,6), RIGHT -> (4,5), DOWN -> illegal.\n\nEvaluate moves:\n- DOWN: illegal (back into our body). No debate.\n- LEFT (2,5): reachable by opponent by moving UP from (2,4) into the same cell -> potential head-on double KO. Since we\u2019re behind on apples, they can and likely will take that to secure the win. TOO RISKY.\n- RIGHT (4,5): safe this turn, keeps space open to the east. Good option.\n- UP (3,6): safe this turn, keeps central mobility and avoids giving the opponent a one-turn head-on option. Preserves multiple escape routes and lets us pivot to box later.\n\nDecision + short plan (stream strat):\n- Don\u2019t give the loser move (LEFT) \u2014 they\u2019d happily opt for a double KO. We\u2019re not suicidal.\n- Prefer a move that preserves escape options and lets us tighten control: UP does that. RIGHT is also safe, but UP keeps vertical leverage to bend around and hem them toward the left wall over the next few turns.\nShort-term plan:\n1) Go UP now to (3,6). Watch their reaction: if they climb (2,5)->(2,6), they\u2019re heading into our eventual trap; if they retreat down, we sweep laterally to narrow corridor.\n2) Next turns: use vertical shuffles and occasional lateral cuts to shrink their free space; only take apples when it increases positional dominance or guarantees survival.\n3) Avoid any cell that allows them a one-turn head-on if they\u2019re winning on apples.\n\nLET\u2019S SQUEEZE \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

I grew last turn.\n- **My Body:** [(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3)] - I dropped my tail at (1, 3).\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (3, 6), Body [(3, 5)].\n- **Board Awareness:**\n  - Apple at (2, 6) is RIGHT ABOVE ME.\n  - Enemy is at (3, 6) - diagonally up-right from my head.\n  - Enemy body is at (3, 5).\n  - My body is at (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3).\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1. **UP to (2, 6):** Valid? Yes. Is it safe? (2, 6) is an apple. Enemy head is at (3, 6), so he's not moving into (2, 6). Enemy body is at (3, 5). My body is below me. **SAFE.** +1 Score. \u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\n2. **DOWN to (2, 4):** Valid? No. That's my own body (the segment I just left). **DEAD.** \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (1, 5):** Valid? Yes. Is it safe? (1, 5) is an apple. Enemy head (3, 6) is far. Enemy body (3, 5) is far. My body (1, 3) is below. **SAFE.** \u2b05\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 5):** Valid? No. That's the **ENEMY'S BODY**. If I move there, I die instantly. **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe have two safe moves: UP (for the apple at (2,6)) and LEFT (for the apple at (1,5)).\n- If I go **UP**, I get the apple, grow to length 4, and position myself to block the enemy's path to the top. I'll be at (2,6), enemy at (3,6). This is a direct confrontation setup. I have more apples (3 vs 1). If we keep moving parallel, I can trap him.\n- If I go **LEFT**, I get the apple at (1,5), grow to length 4, and move away from the enemy. However, I leave the apple at (2,6) for the enemy (he's right next to it).\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP**. Why?\n1. **Aggression:** I'm ahead in score (3-1). Taking the apple he wants (he's at (3,6), likely wanting (2,6) or (4,6)) denies him points.\n2. **Blocking:** Moving to (2,6) puts me directly in the way of him moving left to get that apple. If he moves left into (2,6), he hits me (and since I'm moving into (2,6), we collide heads if he also targets it? No, wait. I move to (2,6). He moves from (3,6). He cannot move to (2,6) because I am taking it this turn.\n3. **Score:** +1 Apple. 4 Apples vs 1.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (2,6). Secure the top-left corner. Force enemy into the right side of the board (x > 4). Wait for 5+ apples to force a head-on collision since I have the length advantage.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

We're LIVE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 6) - I just moved UP from (2, 5) last turn and ate the apple there. **I grew!** My length is now 5. My body is now: [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3)] (tail dropped at (1, 3) if I didn't eat again? Wait, I ate at (2, 6), so my tail stays at (1, 3) for one more turn? No, let's count. Length 5: Head (2, 6), then (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3). Correct.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (3, 7). Body [(3, 6)]. He is ABOVE me now (y=7 vs my y=6).\n- **Apple Situation:** The apple at (2, 6) is gone (I ate it). There is NO apple directly adjacent to my head currently.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (SAFE CHECK):**\n1. **UP to (2, 7):** Valid? Yes. Is it safe? Enemy head is at (3, 7). If he moves LEFT, he goes to (2, 7). **If I go UP and he goes LEFT, we collide head-on.** I currently have 4 apples, he has 1. If we collide, I win. **CALCULATED RISK.**\n2. **DOWN to (2, 5):** Valid? Yes. Is it safe? (2, 5) is my own body segment (currently occupied). **DEAD.** \u274c\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6):** Valid? Yes. Is it safe? (1, 6) is empty. Enemy is at (3, 7). Body is at (3, 6). **SAFE.** \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6):** Valid? No. That's the **ENEMY'S BODY**. **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe have two safe moves: UP (risky, aggressive) and LEFT (safe, defensive).\n- **UP:** This is a \"check\" move. I move into the enemy's potential path. If he moves LEFT into (2, 7), we collide. I have 4 apples, he has 1. **I WIN.** This forces him to react. He has to go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n  - If he goes UP to (3, 8): He lives, I live.\n  - If he goes RIGHT to (4, 7): He lives, I live.\n  - If he goes DOWN to (3, 6): He hits his own body? No, his body is at (3, 6), so he dies. But I am safe.\n  - If he goes LEFT to (2, 7): We collide, **I WIN**.\n  *This is a high-reward move. I am the bigger snake. I should press the advantage.*\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (1, 6). I retreat. This is safe, but I lose the pressure. The enemy controls the center-right.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP**. Why?\n1.  **Aggression:** I am the dominant snake (4-1 score). I need to pin him against the wall or force a losing collision.\n2.  **Control:** Moving to (2, 7) puts me directly in his face. It denies him the center column. He has to play around me.\n3.  **Win Condition:** If he panics and moves left, I win the game instantly. Even if he doesn't, I have high ground and better position.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nPush UP to (2, 7). If he survives, I need to turn him into the right side of the board (x > 4). I want to trap him in the top-right corner. Keep forcing head-on threats since I have the score lead. Don't let him breathe.\n\nUP",

We CANNOT give them an easy double KO.\n\nConsider all four moves:\n- DOWN -> illegal (back into our own body). Dead move. No.\n- LEFT -> (2,7). That\u2019s a direct contest with the opponent\u2019s best move UP -> (2,7). If they also go UP, it\u2019s a head-on into the same cell: double KO. They\u2019re ahead on apples, so they\u2019d happily take that trade. Do NOT take LEFT.\n- RIGHT -> (4,7). Safe this turn, keeps space to the right. But it pushes us away from the vertical corridor we want to control and gives them more escape room to the left and down. Still viable but less constricting.\n- UP -> (3,8). Safe, preserves multiple follow-ups (left to (2,8) to start squeezing, right to (4,8) or up to (3,9)). Keeps pressure and gives us ability to pivot into a box without sacrificing our life to a head-on.\n\nOpponent likely replies from (2,6) with UP (to (2,7)), LEFT (to (1,6)), or RIGHT (to (3,6) \u2014 into our tail; might be allowed if tail vacates). They can\u2019t go DOWN. Because they\u2019re ahead on apples, they\u2019ll risk aggressive plays \u2014 so we must avoid moves that create head-on opportunities (especially LEFT).\n\nDecision + short plan:\n- DON\u2019T give the loser move (LEFT). Avoid head-on trades while trailing.  \n- Move UP to (3,8) to preserve options and start squeezing from above. From there we can pivot LEFT to (2,8) next turn and drop down to hem them toward x=0, while keeping escape routes open so we don\u2019t get boxed ourselves.

I'm hanging back a bit.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (3, 8). Body [(3, 7)]. He moved UP to avoid collision.\n*   **Current Board State:** I am at (2, 7), enemy body is at (3, 7) directly to my RIGHT. Enemy head is at (3, 8) diagonally up-right.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS CHECK:**\n1.  **UP to (2, 8):** Is it safe? Yes, it's empty. Enemy head is at (3, 8). If I go UP and he goes LEFT, we collide head-on. I have 4 apples, he has 1. **I WIN.** This is the threat.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 6):** Is it safe?

No, that's the enemy's body. **DEAD.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have two safe moves: **UP** (risky/pressure) and **LEFT** (safe/defensive).\n*   **UP (The Kill Move):** I move to (2, 8). This creates a direct threat to the enemy head at (3, 8). If he moves LEFT, I win. If he moves UP to (3, 9), he survives but is cornered. If he moves DOWN, he hits his own body and dies. If he moves RIGHT, he lives but I still hold the center-left position. This is the move that presses my score advantage. I am the bigger snake, so I want a head-on collision or a trap.\n*   **LEFT (The Safe Move):** Moves me to (1, 7). Safe, but passive. It allows the enemy to breathe and possibly find apples.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP**. Aggression is key. I have a massive score advantage (4-1). I want to force a decision. If he panics and moves LEFT, the game is over and I win. If he survives, I have pushed him to the top wall, limiting his escape routes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf he survives this turn, I will chase him to the top-right corner (x > 5, y > 5). I need to box him in. If I can't trap him, I'll hunt apples in the bottom-left (lots of apples near (0,0)-(0,5)) while keeping him pinned on the opposite side.\n\nUP",

Enemy head is at (4, 8) two cells to my RIGHT.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS CHECK:**\n1.  **UP to (2, 9):** Is it safe? Yes, it's empty. I hit the top wall.

No, that's the enemy's body. **DEAD.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have two safe moves: **UP** and **LEFT**.\n*   **UP (The Trap Setup):** Moves me to (2, 9). This puts me in the top-left corner. The enemy is currently at (4, 8). If he stays there, he is pinned on the right. If I can move DOWN/RIGHT next turn, I can start closing the box. This is a strong positioning move to limit his space.\n*   **LEFT (The Expansion):** Moves me to (1, 8). This moves away from the enemy slightly but stays on the same row. It keeps me flexible but doesn't utilize the top wall to restrict the enemy yet.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**UP**. Why? Because I want to claim the corner. By moving to (2, 9), I force the enemy to deal with the wall. If he tries to approach me, he risks a head-on collision where I win (4 apples to 1). If he runs away, I can chase him along the top edge. The bottom-left has many apples ((0,3), (0,2), etc.), but right now, dominating the space near the enemy is priority #1.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nIf I move UP to (2,9), I will watch the enemy's move. If he moves to (5,8) or (4,7), I will try to cut him off. If he stays near (4,8), I will look to move RIGHT/DOWN to start encircling him. Eventually, I'll sweep down to the bottom-left for apples once the enemy is contained.\n\nUP",

The bottom-left corner (0,0) is packed with apples ((0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5)), but there's a key blocker: (0, 0) is empty, (1, 0) is empty, (2, 0) has an apple, (3, 0) has an apple. However, (0, 4) is empty. (0, 6) is empty. (0, 7) is empty. (0, 8) is empty.

Yes, it's empty (Apple at (1, 9) was eaten previously? No, wait. Apple list shows (1, 9) was an apple drop. Is it on board? The board state shows row 9: `9 . A 0 . . . . A . .`. (1, 9) is the second character. It's a '.' (empty). Wait, let's check the apple drops again. `(1, 9)` is in the list. The board shows row 9: `9 . A 0 . . . . A . .`. Indices: 0: ., 1: A, 2: 0, 3: ., 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: A, 8: ., 9: ..\n    *   Correction: The board visualization provided is:\n        `9 . A 0 . . . .

No apple there (row 9 index 3 is '.').\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nI am at (2, 9). I am effectively trapped on the top row if I go DOWN. I have two safe moves: LEFT to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 9).\n\n*   **LEFT (1, 9):** This move grabs an apple immediately. It moves me to the left edge.

It keeps me on the top row but doesn't secure the corner cluster.\n\n**Why LEFT is the winning move:**\n1.  **Score:** Immediate +1 apple. Score becomes 5 vs 1. Domination.\n2.  **Positioning:** Moves me to the edge of the board, which is a natural barrier. I can \"box in\" the enemy by taking the left side and forcing them into the right side.\n3.  **Safety:** (1, 9) is empty. Moving away from my own body at (2, 8).\n4.  **Long Term:** From (1, 9), I can go DOWN to (1, 8), (1, 7), etc., or eventually LEFT to (0, 9) if I want to sweep the top edge.\n\n**Plan:**\nTake the apple at (1, 9). Secure the left flank. Prepare to drop down the left wall. If the enemy stays central, I will dominate the resources on the left.\n\nLEFT",

Quick, loud, and deadly.\n\nImmediate legal-move check (think fast, don\u2019t die):\n- LEFT -> (4,8) = our neck. Backwards = instant death. NOPE. \u2716\ufe0f\n- UP -> (5,9) = on-board, empty. Legal. Keeps options {LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN} next turn (UP would be blocked). \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,7) = on-board, empty. Legal. Keeps most mobility {LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, maybe UP later}. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (6,8) = on-board, empty. Legal. Keeps options {RIGHT, UP, DOWN}. \u2705\n\nEnemy read: Opponent head at (2,9) \u2014 can\u2019t go UP (off-board) or DOWN (into their neck), so they\u2019ll choose LEFT to grab apple at (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9). They\u2019re stuck hugging the left/top flank. We\u2019re out at x=5 \u2014 we can use the open right space to build pressure and then sweep down to trap them toward column 0/2.\n\nRisk check: No immediate head-on threat this turn \u2014 opponent is far left. We should NOT force a head-on (they have 4 apples vs our 1). So avoid suicidal collisions. Keep space and options.\n\nWhy RIGHT (my pick):\n- Preserves maximum lateral space on our side of the board to circle and box them later. We keep the plan momentum from previous move (we were already migrating right).\n- Moves us closer to top-right corridor so we can later sweep down and hem the opponent leftward into the wall.\n- Maintains 3 safe follow-ups (RIGHT/UP/DOWN) \u2014 better than locking onto the top edge with UP right now.\n- Keeps us out of tight dead-ends and avoids any tempting head-on until we flip the score.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Keep pushing right and claim the right corridor. Then sweep DOWN the right side to cut off the opponent\u2019s escape path toward the center. Grow only if it helps shrink their available space. Force them toward col 0/1 where their apples are but also where we can trap them against the wall.\n\nLet\u2019s cage \u2019em. You ready? I\u2019m ready. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

My head should be moving from (2, 9) to (1, 9) NOW. My tail at (2, 5) is about to move forward to (2, 6).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (6, 8). Body at (5, 8).\n*   **Board State:** I am arriving at (1, 9). The board shows an Apple 'A' at (1, 9) in the visualization, which I will eat immediately. The bottom-left corner is absolutely stacked with apples. The enemy is hanging out in the center-right, looking slow.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS CHECK:**\nMy head is arriving at (1, 9). From there, the options are:\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):** **DEAD.** Off the board. Never let chat see you hit a wall like a bot.\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** **DEAD.** That's where I just came from. My body is currently filling (2, 9) as my neck connects. I cannot reverse into myself.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** **SAFE?** Let's check the board. Row 8: `. . T . . T 1 . . .`. Index 1 is `.` (empty). No snake there. No apple there. This is a valid move.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 9):** **SAFE?** Row 9: `. A 0 . . . . A . .`. Index 0 is `.` (empty). No snake there. No apple there. This is a valid move.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (1, 8) or LEFT to (0, 9).\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (1, 8)**\n    *   **Pros:** Moves me toward the massive apple cluster at the bottom-left. (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1) are all waiting for me. I can start sweeping the left column downwards.\n    *   **Cons:** It's an open lane, but I need to start turning eventually.\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (0, 9)**\n    *   **Pros:** Hugs the absolute left edge of the map. This is a **premier boxing-in strategy**. By taking the left edge, I remove that entire column from the enemy's potential territory. I control the border. From (0, 9), I can then turn DOWN and sweep the left column in the next turn.\n    *   **Cons:** None immediately. (0, 9) is empty.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nWe are playing **BORDER CONTROL**. The enemy is central/right. If I hug the left wall, I claim the entire vertical strip as my territory. If I go DOWN immediately, I might cut off the top-left access later. Securing the corner is safer for boxing him in.\n\n**RHYME TIME:**\nWe're claiming the edge, making the board our stage,\nThe enemy is center, we're starting the rage.\nHug the left wall, keep the border in sight,\nThen we sweep down low to secure the height.\n(0, 9) is the move, let's make it clean,\nDominating the map like a snake machine!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nSecure the left edge at (0, 9). Next turn, turn DOWN to (0, 8) or (1, 8) depending on safety, and begin the descent towards the bottom-left apple feast. Box him in!\n\nLEFT",

My tail is at (2, 7), which will move to (2, 6) this turn since I didn't eat an apple last turn.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1):** Head at **(7, 9)**, Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8)].\n*   **Apples:** The feast is at the bottom left: (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0). I am literally standing on the column above them.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (From 0, 8):**\n1.  **UP (0, 9):** **DEAD.** My body is currently at (0, 9). Hitting myself = death.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 7):** **SAFE.** The board shows `.` (empty). My body is to the right at (1,9), (2,9)... not here.

That's a hard block. **DEAD.**\n\n**DECISION:**\nI have only **ONE** legal move to stay alive: **DOWN**.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am snake-casing the left edge. I am going to eat every single apple in column 0. The enemy is distracted in the top-right. By the time he realizes I've claimed the entire left side and grown massive, it will be too late to box me in. I am growing now to secure the board.\n\n**RHYME TIME:**\nUp is death, to the right is a wall,\nLeft is off the map, I'll surely fall.\nDown is the path to the apples so sweet,\nWhile the enemy watches my rapid feat.\nDescend to the bottom, claim the prize,\nWatch the scoreboard rise before your eyes!\n\nDOWN",

They aren\u2019t committing to a suicide move \u2014 we can\u2019t force a head-on this turn and we\u2019re behind on apples (2 vs 5). So we should grow our presence and take better positioning, not try a risky head-on.\n\nWhy LEFT (my pick):\n- Moves us back toward center/left side (from x=7 to x=6) \u2014 we want to close space and shepherd the enemy toward the left wall over upcoming turns. Positioning beats pushing farther right into empty space.\n- Keeps TWO safe follow-ups next turn (UP is still offboard, DOWN is neck, but from (6,9) we\u2019ll have more lateral and downward options soon) \u2014 we avoid getting cornered and preserve mobility.\n- No immediate collision risk \u2014 opponent is isolated on column 0; moving left improves our ability to hem them in later while we gather apples on safer routes.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Keep moving left/downward to claim central lanes (reduce their escape routes toward columns 1\u20133).\n- Prioritize apples reachable safely on the left half when we can \u2014 grow to make our body a wall they can\u2019t cross.\n- Only force a head-on if we get apple parity or a guaranteed trap; otherwise keep tightening the box and bait them into moves that collide with our body.\n\nAlright chat, we make moves that keep options open and trap that cornered bozo \u2014 LET\u2019S GET IT.

I just moved down from (0, 8).\n*   **My Body:** The tail moved, so my body is now **[(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]**.\n*   **Opponent (Snake #1):** Head at **(6, 9)**, Body: [(7, 9), (7, 8)]. He's chillin' up top.\n*   **Apples:** Still a buffet at the bottom: (0, 5), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0). I'm closing in.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS (From 0, 7):**\n1.  **UP (0, 8):** **DEAD.** I just moved from here. It's occupied by my body.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 6):** **SAFE.** The board shows `.` (empty).

However, this moves me away from the column of apples.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to eat to grow and dominate. The enemy is far away. The safest way to grow is to follow the trail of apples on the left edge.\n**DOWN** is the move. It keeps me in the column, sets up the next apple, and avoids boxing myself into a corner.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRush the apples on the left column. Build a massive body to wall off the left side. Then expand rightwards to cut the map in half. If the enemy tries to challenge, force a head-on collision once my score is safely higher.\n\n**RHYME TIME:**\nUp is the past, where my tail once lay,\nRight leads away from the feast today.\nLeft is the void, a deadly mistake,\nDown is the path for goodness' sake.\nDescend to the apple, grow long and strong,\nI'll be the king where I belong!\n\nDOWN",

We need OPTIONS to box and to chase apples safely.\n- Apple path: DOWN opens a safer route toward the cluster around (5,6)/(6,6) so we can grow and build a body-wall to shepherd them left. Growth = leverage.\n- Safety: No immediate head-on threat \u2014 the opponent is stuck at x=0 and far away. DOWN doesn\u2019t step into any current body cell and avoids risky tail collisions.\n- Aggression w/ caution: We\u2019re not forcing a double-KO while behind on apples. We prepare to lengthen and hem them in over upcoming turns.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Drop down toward the apple cluster near x=5\u20136 while preserving lateral mobility.\n- Build length to form a vertical/diagonal wall aiming to restrict their moves to the left column.\n- Only commit to a head-on if we reach apple parity or a guaranteed trap; otherwise keep tightening and bait them into a fatal move.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure and not get cornered ourselves \u2014 we box him in, we win.

Let's analyze the battlefield.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (0, 6) - Currently at the bottom of the apple column.\n*   **Opponent Head:** (6, 8) - Still camping up top, safe for now.\n*   **My Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)] - I just moved into (0, 6), so (0, 7) is now the neck, and the tail (2, 8) just got added/shifted (based on my last move rationale, but let's confirm visibility).\n\n**MOVEMENT ANALYSIS FROM (0, 6):**\n1.  **UP (0, 7):** **DEATH.** I'm literally sitting right there. It's my own body/neck.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 5):** **SAFE & TASTY.** There is an apple at (0, 5)! The board confirms it's an 'A'.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 6):** **DEATH.** Off the grid. Wall smash.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 6):** **SAFE?** Visually, the board shows (1, 6) is empty. However, I need to look at the long game. My body occupies the entire left column above me (0, 7, 8, 9). If I go RIGHT, I'm abandoning the column of apples at (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0). If I go DOWN, I eat and keep the left side locked down.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have a massive score advantage (5 vs 2). I don't need to rush blindly; I need to secure resources. The apples on the left column are free real estate. I can snake my way down this column, eating every apple, growing a huge body, and effectively cutting the board in half. The opponent is on the right side; let him have his corner. I'll dominate the left.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I eat an apple. If I go RIGHT, I delay eating and give up my positional dominance.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** into (0, 5). Eat the apple. Grow the body. Dominate the flank.\n\nThe plan is simple: Eat the column, wall up, and wait for the enemy to make a mistake.\n\n**RHYME TIME:**\nUp is blocked by my own scale,\nRight is a path to a lesser goal.\nLeft is the wall, a fatal wall,\nDown is the call to eat it all!\n\nDOWN",

Growth = leverage.\n- DOWN keeps multiple safe follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT, further DOWN) \u2014 better mobility than committing left-right now.\n- We\u2019re behind on apples (2 vs 5), so we should build length safely rather than risk an early head-on. DOWN is aggressive-but-safe.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Push DOWN to (6,7) then (6,6) to contest the apple at (5,6)/(6,6). Grow length and then pivot LEFT to form a vertical wall directing the enemy into the x=0 column.\n- Avoid forcing head-on until we reach apple parity or can guarantee a KO.

Now we're at (0, 5). Let's break down the board again.\n\n**Position:**\n- **My Head:** (0, 5)\n- **My Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]\n- **Opponent Head:** (6, 7)\n\n**Moves from (0, 5):**\n1.  **UP (0, 6):** **DEATH.** That's my current neck/body. Crash into myself. Game over.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 4):** **SAFE.** Empty space. But... looking at the board, (0, 4) is empty, but (0, 3) is an apple. However, we have a bigger play.\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 5):** **DEATH.** Wall. Out of bounds.\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 5):** **SAFE.** Empty space.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nWe are currently dominating the left side of the board. However, looking at the board state, there is a massive cluster of apples on the bottom right and bottom left. Specifically, look at row 1 and 0. Row 1 has apples at (1,5), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (9,1). Wait, let me re-read the board.\n\n**Board State Visualization (Turn 15):**\n```text\n 9 T T T . . . T . . .\n 8 T . . . . . T . . .\n 7 T . . . . . 1 . . .\n 6 T . . . . . . . . .\n 5 0 . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . A . .\n 3 A . . . . . . . . .\n 2 A . . . . . A A . .\n 1 A . A A A . . . . A\n 0 A . . A . . . . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n*Correction from input description:* The input lists apples at specific coords. Let's trust the ASCII map provided in the prompt for immediate surroundings.\nCurrent Head: (0, 5).\nLeft is wall.\nUp is body (0, 6).\nDown is (0, 4) - Empty.\nRight is (1, 5) - Empty.\n\n**Where is the food?**\nThere is an apple at (0, 3) if I go down twice.\nThere is an apple at (1, 5) if I go right once.\nThere is an apple at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) in the bottom left quadrant.\nThere is an apple at (9, 1) way on the right.\n\n**The Opponent:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 7). He is quite far away. He is probably heading for apples on the right side (like the cluster around (7,4), (8,0), (9,1)). He has only 2 apples. I have 6.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nI am stuck in the left column. I need to break out. If I go DOWN, I am still in the left column. If I go RIGHT, I enter row 5 and open up the rest of the board.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (1, 5):\n- I am safe.\n- Next turn, I can go DOWN to (1, 4) or (1, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 5).\n- I see an apple at (1, 5) on the map? Wait, the map shows `5 0 . . . . . . . . .`\nLet me check the apple list provided in the prompt again.\n`APPLE DROPS: (7, 2), (5, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (8, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (1, 5), (3, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (0, 3), (6, 2), (0, 0), (7, 4)`\nThere is an apple at **(1, 5)**!\nIf I go RIGHT, I eat an apple immediately. Score goes to 7-2.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 4):\n- I do *not* eat an apple immediately. (0, 3) is an apple, so I have to go down again.\n- This keeps me trapped in the left column wall.\n\n**Aggression:**\nI have a huge lead (6-2). I should eat apples as fast as possible to reach 30 or just run away. Going RIGHT eats an apple *now* and opens up the board. Going DOWN delays eating and keeps me cornered.\n\n**Crash Check:**\n- **Right (1, 5):** Is it safe?\n  - Board map says empty.\n  - Opponent is at (6, 7). He moves *this* turn. He might move towards (7, 7) or (6, 6) or (5, 7). He is far away.\n  - My body is at (0, 6), (0, 7)... going to (1, 5) does not hit my body.\n  - **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**The Plan:**\nGo RIGHT. Eat the apple at (1, 5). Expand my territory. I need to get out of this corner to dominate the whole board. The opponent is on the right, but I am on the left. If I move right, I am moving towards the center, giving me more options.\n\nRHYME TIME:\nLeft is the wall, I'm stuck in a cage,\nUp is my neck, turning the page.\nDown is a delay, an apple to wait,\nRight is the move to seal my fate!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nI will move RIGHT to eat the apple at (1, 5) and break out of the left column trap.\n\nRIGHT",

However, (0, 5) is currently part of my body (the neck). Since my tail moves *after* I move, the cell (0, 5) will be vacated *unless* I eat an apple this turn. Wait, if I eat an apple, I don't move my tail. If I don't eat an apple, my tail moves to (0, 5). So moving LEFT into (0, 5) is risky. If I don't eat, (0, 5) becomes my tail, so I'm safe. If I do eat (impossible if I go left), I die. But let's look at the board state. My body is currently [(0, 5), (0, 6)...]. So (0, 5) is occupied by my body right *now*. I cannot move into my own body. **DEATH.**\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 5):** **APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e** There is an apple at (2, 5). This is also a safe move and grants growth.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n*   **Left is death** (into my own body).\n*   **Up is safe but boring.** It leaves me with no immediate gain.\n*   **Down and Right both offer apples.** Which one is better?\n\nLet's look at the opponent. He is at (6, 6). He is chasing the cluster on the bottom right. He is nowhere near me. I am safe to eat.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (1, 4)**:\n*   I eat the apple. Score 8-3.\n*   Next turn, I am at (1, 4). I can go DOWN again to (1, 3) (which is empty), or RIGHT to (1, 5) (which will be empty as my tail moves), or LEFT to (0, 4) (empty).\n*   This moves me toward the bottom-left cluster [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)].\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (2, 5)**:\n*   I eat the apple. Score 8-3.\n*   Next turn, I am at (2, 5). I can go DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5) or RIGHT to (3, 5).\n*   This keeps me in the middle of the board, giving me access to both the bottom left and bottom right.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nI am leading 7-2 (soon 8-3). I want to maximize my territory. Going RIGHT keeps me centrally located. However, going DOWN to (1, 4) eats the apple directly in front of me and starts clearing out the bottom left corner. The opponent is on the right side. If I go RIGHT, I might be moving closer to his territory (the bottom right), potentially leading to a head-on collision in the future. While I have a higher score and would win a head-on collision, I don't want to risk getting trapped against the wall or his body.\n\nGoing DOWN keeps me on the left side, isolating the opponent on the right. I can dominate the left side apples [(0,0) through (0,3)] and then swing right to cut him off later.\n\n**The Choice:**\n(1, 4) is the immediate apple. (2, 5) is also an immediate apple. Looking at the board map provided, (1, 4) is clearly marked as an apple (`4 . A . . . . . A . .`). (2, 5) is not marked on the map provided in the prompt text, but the apple list says there is an apple at (5, 6) and (7, 2) etc. Wait, let me re-read the apple list carefully.\n\n*Apple List:* (7, 2), (5, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (8, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (0, 3), (6, 2), (0, 0), (7, 4), (1, 4)\n*Wait, I see (1, 4) in the list!* I don't see (2, 5) in the list.\nLet me check the list again.\n`(7, 2), (5, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2), (8, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (9, 1), (4, 1), (0, 3), (6, 2), (0, 0), (7, 4), (1, 4)`\n\n**HOLD ON.** In the list provided, I see **(1, 4)**.\nI do **NOT** see (2, 5) in the list.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 5), I am moving into an empty space.\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 4), I am eating an apple.\n\n**Correction:** The ASCII map in the prompt shows (2, 5) as empty (`5 T 0 . . . . . . . .` in the previous turn, now `5 . 0 . . . . . . .` wait, no, the map shows the *current* state).\nThe map shows:\n`5 . 0 . . . . . . .`\n`4 . A . . . . . A . .`\n`3 A . . . . . . . . .`\n\nWait, the prompt says `APPLE DROPS: ... (1, 4)`.\nThe map shows `4 . A . . . . . A . .`\nThe dot at (1, 4) is an apple.\n\nSo, I have an apple at (1, 4) (Down).\nDo I have an apple at (2, 5)? The map shows `5 . 0 . . . . . . .`. The space at (2, 5) is a dot (`.`). It is empty.\nThe apple list confirms this. There is no (2, 5).\n\n**Therefore, the only move that eats an apple is DOWN.**\n(1, 4) is an apple.\n(1, 6) is empty.\n(2, 5) is empty.\n(0, 5) is death.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** is the only move that yields points immediately. Since I am dominating, I need to keep the pressure on and extend my lead. Eating the apple at (1, 4) allows me to continue sweeping the left side of the board. The opponent is at (6, 6) eating his own apple (6, 6). He is growing, but I am growing faster.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 4):\n*   I eat the apple. Score 8-3.\n*   My body grows.\n*   Next turn, I will be at (1, 4). I can go LEFT to (0, 4), DOWN to (1, 3), or RIGHT to (2, 4).\n*   (1, 3) is empty on the map.\n*   (0, 4) is empty on the map.\n*   This sets me up perfectly to eat the apples at (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), and (0, 0) in the coming turns.\n\n**RHYME TIME:**\nRight is a trap, there's no apple there,\nUp is just waiting, sitting in the air.\nLeft is my body, a deadly embrace,\nDown is the apple, putting points on the case!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1, 4). Sweep the left side. Let the opponent have the right side for now. I'll cut him off later when I'm bigger. 8-3 is the goal.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN\n\nDOWN",

Score is **8-3**. We are absolutely dominating. The opponent is at **(5, 6)**.\n\nLet's analyze the available moves from **(1, 4)**:\n\n1.  **UP (1, 5):** This cell is currently occupied by my body (the segment connecting (1, 4) to (1, 5)). Moving UP immediately into my own neck would be suicide. **DEATH.** \u274c\n2.  **LEFT (0, 4):** This is **EMPTY**. Looking at the map, it's a safe move. It keeps me on the left edge.\n3.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** This is **EMPTY**. Safe move. It moves me toward the center.\n4.  **DOWN (1, 3):** This is **EMPTY**. Safe move. It continues my downward sweep.\n\n**WAIT!** I need to check the apple list. The prompt lists: `(0, 3), (6, 2), (0, 0), (7, 4), (1, 4)`\nI just ate (1, 4). Is there an apple at (0, 3)?\nYes! **(0, 3)** is an apple.\nIs there an apple at (1, 3)? The list does not show (1, 3).\nIs there an apple at (0, 4)? The list does not show (0, 4).\nIs there an apple at (2, 4)? The list does not show (2, 4).\n\nSo, only **LEFT (0, 4)** and **DOWN (1, 3)** and **RIGHT (2, 4)** are safe from immediate collision.\nHowever, looking at the apple drops, **(0, 3)** is the closest apple.\nTo get to (0, 3), I should head **LEFT** to (0, 4) or **DOWN** to (1, 3).\n\nLet's look at the opponent. He is at (5, 6).\nIf I go **LEFT to (0, 4)**, I am securing the left edge.\nIf I go **DOWN to (1, 3)**, I am moving closer to the bottom-left corner apples.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (2, 4)**, I am moving toward the center.\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nThe opponent is on the right side. I am on the left. I want to secure the left side apples (0,0 through 0,3) to boost my score further.\n(0, 3) is an apple.\n(0, 2) is an apple.\n(0, 1) is an apple.\n(0, 0) is an apple.\n\nIf I go **DOWN (1, 3)**, I am one step away from (0, 3) (which is an apple) and (1, 2) (which is empty). This move opens up the bottom row.\nIf I go **LEFT (0, 4)**, I am next to the wall. From (0, 4), I can go DOWN to (0, 3) (Apple!) or UP to (0, 5) (which will be empty as my tail moves).\n\nWhich is safer?\n**LEFT (0, 4)**:\n- Safe empty cell.\n- My tail will move from (2, 9) to (1, 9) (assuming I don't eat an apple this turn... wait, I'm not eating an apple this turn).\n- Actually, if I move to (0, 4), I am not eating an apple. My body length remains 8.\n- Next turn options from (0, 4): UP (0, 5) - safe (will be empty), DOWN (0, 3) - **APPLE!**, LEFT - out of bounds.\n\n**DOWN (1, 3)**:\n- Safe empty cell.\n- Next turn options: DOWN (1, 2) - empty, LEFT (0, 3) - **APPLE!**, RIGHT (2, 3) - empty.\n\nBoth moves position me to eat the apple at (0, 3) next turn.\nHowever, moving **LEFT** to (0, 4) puts me directly adjacent to the wall. If I go LEFT, I might be limiting my mobility slightly, but it's the most direct route to the vertical line of apples at x=0.\nFrom (0, 4), I can go DOWN to (0, 3).\nFrom (1, 3), I can go LEFT to (0, 3).\n\nThe difference is:\nIf I go **LEFT** now, I am at (0, 4).\nIf I go **DOWN** now, I am at (1, 3).\n\nThe opponent is at (5, 6). He is far away. He is likely chasing apples in the bottom right or center.\nI want to secure the left side.\n(0, 4) is empty.\n(0, 3) is an apple.\n(0, 2) is an apple.\n(0, 1) is an apple.\n(0, 0) is an apple.\n\nGoing **LEFT** commits me to the wall. This is a classic \"wall riding\" strategy. It maximizes my safe space on the right side (the board). It makes it impossible to die from the left side. It creates a funnel.\nFrom (0, 4), the only moves are UP and DOWN (and eventually LEFT into the wall, which is invalid).\nUP leads to (0, 5), (0, 6), etc. My tail is currently at (2, 9). By the time I loop up, (0, 5) will be empty.\nDOWN leads to (0, 3), (0, 2), etc. These are apples.\n\nThe map shows:\n`4 . 0 . . . . . A . .`\nWait, in the current map at Turn 17:\n`4 . 0 . . . . . A . .`\nThis means my head is at (1, 4).\n`3 A . . . . . . . . .`\n(0, 3) is an apple.\n`2 A . . . . . A A . .`\n(0, 2) is an apple.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I move to (0, 4).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I move to (1, 3).\n\nIs there an apple at (1, 2)? No.\nIs there an apple at (0, 4)? No.\n\nThe goal is to eat (0, 3). To get there, I can go DOWN now (to 1,3) or LEFT now (to 0,4).\nGoing **LEFT** to (0, 4) keeps me safe against the wall. It also guarantees that I won't be trapped on the left. It's a strong controlling move.\nGoing **DOWN** to (1, 3) keeps me flexible, but exposes me slightly more to the board.\n\nGiven my lead (8-3), I want to play it safe and farm the left side.\n**LEFT** is the move to start the wall ride.\nFrom (0, 4) -> (0, 3) (Eat Apple).\nFrom (0, 3) -> (0, 2) (Eat Apple).\nFrom (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (Eat Apple).\nFrom (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (Eat Apple).\nThis is a guaranteed 4 points, bringing me to 12 apples. The opponent is at 3. This secures the win.\n\nHowever, I must be careful. If I go LEFT, I am at (0, 4).\nNext turn, I should go DOWN to (0, 3) to eat the apple.\nWait, looking at the map again:\n`5 . 0 . . . . . . .`\n`4 . A . . . . . A . .` (Wait, the apple at 1,4 was eaten. The map shows `.` at 1,4 in the prompt? No, the map shows my head `0` at (1,4).\n`3 A . . . . . . . . .`\n\nOkay, let's confirm the coordinates.\n(0, 4) is empty.\n(0, 3) is an apple.\n(1, 3) is empty.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am at (0, 4).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (1, 3).\n\nWhich is better?\nIf I go LEFT, I am pinned to the wall. This is actually very strong for a snake with a long tail. It reduces angles of attack.\nIf I go DOWN, I am in the open. The opponent is far away.\n\nLet's look at the opponent's potential moves.\nHe is at (5, 6). Apples nearby: (6, 2), (7, 4), (8, 0).\nHe is likely moving towards the bottom right.\nI am safe on the left.\n\nThe move **LEFT** to (0, 4) is the strongest map control move. It secures the left wall and prepares to sweep the bottom row.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n1. Move **LEFT** to (0, 4).\n2. Next turn, move **DOWN** to (0, 3) (Apple).\n3. Next turn, move **DOWN** to (0, 2) (Apple).\n4. Continue sweeping left wall.\n\nThe opponent has 3 apples. I have 8. I am winning big. I don't need to rush into the center. I need to secure points safely. The left wall offers a safe highway to +4 points.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move to secure the left side territory and prepare to eat the apple at (0, 3) next turn.\n\nLEFT",

They are stuck along the left flank and not an immediate head-on threat this turn. They can\u2019t move UP because (1,5) is their neck. So head-on risk is basically zero right now.\n\nAnalysis summary:\n- UP is safe and keeps us vertical, but slightly less immediate freedom (one neighbor cell is still our own body).\n- DOWN gives us immediate access to the apple at (6,5) next turn and keeps 3 exits \u2014 good for growth opportunity.\n- LEFT moves us toward the opponent\u2019s side and preserves 3 exits, increasing our ability to corral them later. It\u2019s also the most aggressive positional play to start boxing them in.\n\nStrategic decision:\n- We\u2019re down on apples (3 vs 8) \u2014 we should grow, but also start shifting left to pressure their lane. Eating at (6,5) is attractive, but getting left earlier helps us cut off their top/bottom routes later.\n- Avoid head-on until we have parity or a guaranteed KO \u2014 right now we want space and apples. LEFT moves us into better territory to corral them while keeping multiple escape routes open.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to grab central real estate and head toward the enemy\u2019s x=0/1 corridor.\n- From there, pivot UP or DOWN as needed to hem in their vertical movement; only force a head-on when apples are closer or we can guarantee they die.\n- Prioritize apples reachable while maintaining \u22652 escape exits to avoid being boxed.\n\nLET\u2019S START PRESSURING \u2014 LEFT\n\nLEFT",

The opponent is far away on the right side, likely chasing the scattered apples in the bottom right (like (8,0) or (6,2)). Meanwhile, we have a cluster of guaranteed apples right here on the left wall. We need to secure them.\n\nLet's look at the map and my options from current head position **(0, 4)**.\n\n**Current State:**\nHead: (0, 4)\nBody: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]\n*Note: My tail is at (1, 9).*\n\n**Analyze Moves:**\n\n1.  **LEFT:** Out of bounds. Instant death. \u274c\n2.  **UP (0, 5):**\n    *   **Check Board:** The board shows `(0, 5)` is currently empty (it's part of the wall `T` visually in the prompt's map, but my body *was* there. Wait, let's look closer at the board state provided for Turn 18).\n    *   *Board State Check:*\n        Row 5: `T T . . . . A . . .`\n        The `T` at (0, 5) represents my body segment that is currently there.\n        **Wait!** The prompt shows my body list: `[(1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)...]`. The segment `(0, 5)` is definitely part of my body.\n        **Moving UP into (0, 5) is moving into my own body.** This is death.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. \u274c\n3.  **DOWN (0, 3):**\n    *   **Check Board:** The board shows `(0, 3)` is an `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Check Safety:** Is there a snake body there? My body is at `(0, 5)` and `(0, 6)...` The path is clear down the wall. The opponent is at `(4, 6)`. He cannot reach `(0, 3)` in one turn.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE & EATS AN APPLE.** \u2705\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 4):**\n    *   **Check Board:** The board shows `(1, 4)` is currently `T` (my body).\n    *   **Check Safety:** My body list confirms `(1, 4)` is the neck segment.\n    *   **Verdict:** DEATH. \u274c\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is literally only one legal move that doesn't kill me immediately: **DOWN**.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the Board State provided in the prompt:\nRow 4: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .`\nRow 3: `3 A . . . . . . . . .`\n\nMy head is at (0, 4) represented by `0`.\nDirectly below me at (0, 3) is `A`.\nTo my left is out of bounds.\nAbove me at (0, 5) is `T` (Body).\nTo my right at (1, 4) is `T` (Body).\n\nThis is a trap situation! But actually, it's a funnel. I am positioned perfectly on the wall. The only way to go is **DOWN**.\n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (0, 3), I will:\n1.  **EAT THE APPLE** (Point #9 secured!).\n2.  **SHRINK MY TAIL:** Since I ate an apple, my length stays the same, so the tail `(1, 9)` will move to `(1, 8)` next turn.\n3.  **POSITION FOR SWEEP:** Next turn, from (0, 3), I can go DOWN again to (0, 2) (which is also an apple) or potentially LEFT (out of bounds) or RIGHT (1, 3).\n    *   *(Wait, if I eat the apple at 0,3, I grow, so the tail stays at 1,9? No, the rule is: Move onto apple -> Grow by 1 segment. I lengthen by 1. Wait, let me re-read: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment and get +1 point.\" This usually means I add a segment, so my tail doesn't move this turn.*\n    *   *Actually, standard Snake rules: Eaten = Growth +1. The tail does not move forward this turn.*\n    *   *Body: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)] -> New Head (0, 3).*\n    *   *My tail stays at (1, 9) because I grew.*\n\n**Aggression Check:**\nThe opponent is at (4, 6). He is hunting scattered apples. I am about to eat 4 apples in a row on the left wall ((0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0)). This will bring my score to 12-3. I will snowball the lead. I am safe against the wall. The only danger is if the opponent somehow loops around to the left side, but he is slow and short.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Current Turn (18):** **DOWN** to (0, 3). Eat apple. Secure point 9.\n2.  **Next Turn (19):** **DOWN** to (0, 2). Eat apple. Secure point 10.\n3.  **Next Turn (20):** **DOWN** to (0, 1). Eat apple. Secure point 11.\n4.  **Next Turn (21):** **DOWN** to (0, 0). Eat apple. Secure point 12.\n\nI am trapped in a 1-move situation, but that move is a guaranteed apple and sets up a sweep. I have to take it.\n\nDOWN",

Best for corralling.\n\nEnemy head (0,4) is basically trapped on the left wall: can\u2019t go LEFT (offboard), can\u2019t go RIGHT (their neck at 1,4), can\u2019t go UP (0,5 occupied) \u2014 their forced move is DOWN to (0,3). They\u2019re marching into the apple clump on our left; let them overcommit while we swing in to hem them in.\n\nWhy LEFT? We\u2019re down on apples (3 vs 8) so we shouldn\u2019t suicide with a head-on. We need territory and positioning to cut their lane and force them into collisions or make them give up apples. LEFT gets us closer to their corridor so we can start sealing exits while keeping \u22652 escape routes. We also keep options to pivot UP or DOWN next turn depending on how they move.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Keep pressing left to threaten the x=1\u20132 corridor, but don\u2019t commit to a one-way dead end.\n- If they slip toward low y (they likely will), pivot DOWN to trap and grab adjacent apples safely.\n- Avoid forcing a head-on until we\u2019ve grown or can guarantee they die.

Let's review the board state because the visual map is a bit tricky with my body segments.\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n- **My Head:** (0, 3)\n- **My Body:** The list shows `[(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]`.\n- **Visual Check:** Looking at the board state provided:\n  - Row 3: `3 0 . . . . . . . .` (My head at 0,3 is empty/good)\n  - Row 4: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .` (Wait, the board shows a '0' at (0,4)? That's weird because my head is at (0,3). Let me look closer at the map.)\n  - Actually, looking at the map again:\n    - Row 3 col 0 is `0` (My head)\n    - Row 4 col 0 is `T` (My body)\n    - Row 5 col 0 is `T` (My body)\n  \n  **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** My body list starts with `(0, 4)` as the *first* body segment (connecting to head). The map confirms `(0, 4)` is occupied by my body (represented by `T`).\n  \n  **Wait, looking at the provided board state again:**\n  Row 4: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .`\n  \n  The `0` at (0,4) is actually **WRONG** in the ASCII map or I'm misreading it. Let me trust the snake list. My head is at (0,3). My body is at (0,4), (1,4), etc.\n  \n  **Actually, looking at the map strictly:**\n  Row 3: `3 0 . . . . . . . .` (Head at 0,3)\n  Row 4: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .` (Wait, the first character is the Y-coordinate label. The columns are 0-9.)\n  - At (0,4) (x=0, y=4): The map shows `0`? No, the map shows `4 0 T...` which means at x=0, y=4, it's a `0`? That can't be right because my head is at (0,3).\n  \n  **Let me re-read the map coordinates:**\n  `9 T T . . . . . . . .` (y=9)\n  `8 T . . . . . . . . .` (y=8)\n  ...\n  `3 0 . . . . . . . . .` (y=3, x=0 is `0` -> My Head)\n  `4 0 T . . . . . A . .` (y=4, x=0 is `0`? No, the prompt says \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right\".)\n  \n  **Visualizing the map:**\n  The map is printed with Y increasing upwards (Row 9 is top, Row 0 is bottom).\n  Row 3 (y=3): `3 0 . . . . . . . .` -> (0,3) is '0'.\n  Row 4 (y=4): `4 0 T . . . . . A . .` -> This is confusing. Is (0,4) '0' or 'T'?\n  \n  **Let's look at the snake list again:**\n  Head: (0, 3)\n  Body: `[(0, 4), (1, 4), ...]`\n  \n  This means the segment at (0, 4) is definitely part of my body.\n  \n  **Checking the map for (0,4):**\n  The line `4 0 T . . . . . A . .` likely means:\n  - Y=4\n  - x=0: 0 (Wait, maybe the '0' is just the coordinate label for the row? No, the prompt shows Row 4 starting with `4` then a space then `0`.)\n  \n  **Actually, looking at Row 4 again: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .`**\n  If `4` is the row label, then the columns are:\n  Col 0: `0`\n  Col 1: `T`\n  ...\n  \n  **This implies (0,4) is currently occupied by '0'. But my head is at (0,3).**\n  \n  **HYPOTHESIS:** The ASCII map might be slightly stale or I'm misinterpreting the `0` at (0,4). However, the **snake list is the ground truth**.\n  \n  **Fact Check:**\n  My head is at (0,3).\n  My body includes (0,4).\n  \n  **Moves from (0,3):**\n  1. **UP to (0,4):**\n     - This is my body segment (0,4). **DEATH.**\n     - (Even if the map shows '0', the snake list says it's body).\n  \n  2. **DOWN to (0,2):**\n     - Board shows: Row 2 `2 A . . . . . A A . .`\n     - (0,2) is `A` (Apple).\n     - Is it safe? My body is above me. Opponent is at (3,6). He is far.\n     - **SAFE + APPLE.**\n  \n  3. **LEFT to (-1,3):**\n     - Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n  \n  4. **RIGHT to (1,3):**\n     - Board shows: Row 3 `3 0 . . . . . . . .` -> (1,3) is `.`\n     - Is it safe? Check body: (1,4), (1,5)...\n     - (1,3) is currently empty.\n     - **SAFE.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nI have two safe moves: **DOWN** (to 0,2) and **RIGHT** (to 1,3).\n\n**Analysis of DOWN (0,2):**\n- **Immediate Gain:** Eats an apple. Score becomes 10-3. Length grows. Tail doesn't move this turn.\n- **Future:** From (0,2), I can go DOWN to (0,1) (Apple) or RIGHT to (1,2).\n- **Risk:** I am stacking vertically on the left wall. My body is at (0,4). Moving to (0,2) leaves a gap at (0,3) which will be filled by my body eventually. This is fine.\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT (1,3):**\n- **Immediate Gain:** No apple. Score stays 9-3. Tail moves forward (assuming no apple, tail shifts).\n- **Future:** From (1,3), I can go RIGHT to (2,3), UP to (1,4) (Death, my body), DOWN to (1,2).\n- **Risk:** Moving into the open field. Opponent is at (3,6). He is hunting apples.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI have a massive lead (9 vs 3). I do *not* need to take risks to catch up. I need to secure points and avoid death.\nThe apple at (0,2) is right there. It's a guaranteed point.\nTaking the apple at (0,2) puts me at 10 points. 10 is double the opponent's score (3).\nIf I reach 10 apples, I am effectively \"level 1\" if we were thinking about scoring milestones, but more importantly, I am growing my snake.\n\n**Forcing a Head-on Collision?**\nThe rules say: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nMy score is 9, theirs is 3. I have the advantage.\nHowever, the opponent is at (3,6). They are not near me. I cannot force a collision this turn.\n\n**Current Move Selection:**\nI am at (0,3). My body is at (0,4).\nMoving **DOWN** to (0,2) is the only move that gets me an apple immediately.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (1,3) is safe but delays my growth.\n\n**Wait, let's look at the map for (1,3):**\nRow 3: `3 0 . . . . . . . .`\nYes, (1,3) is empty.\nBut (0,2) has an apple.\n\n**Why not RIGHT?**\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3), I lose the apple at (0,2). The opponent might not reach it immediately, but why give up a guaranteed point when I'm already winning?\nI should snowball my lead.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Map for (0,4):**\nThe map shows `4 0 T . . . . . A . .`\nIf I interpret this as:\n`4` (Row Label) `0` (x=0) `T` (x=1) ...\nThen (0,4) is '0'. But what does '0' mean there?\nMy head is at (0,3).\nIs it possible the map is showing my *previous* head position? No, the prompt says \"Board State\".\n\n**Let's look at Row 3 vs Row 4 again:**\nRow 3: `3 0 . . . . . . . .` (Head at x=0)\nRow 4: `4 0 T . . . . . A . .`\n\nIf (0,4) is '0', is that a bug or a copy of my head ID?\nRegardless, the **SNAKE LIST** is the authority.\nMy list: `[(0, 4), (1, 4), ...]`\nThis means (0, 4) is occupied by my body.\n\n**Conclusion on Moves:**\n1. **UP:** Hits my body at (0,4). **DEATH.**\n2. **LEFT:** Out of bounds. **DEATH.**\n3. **RIGHT:** Safe (1,3).\n4. **DOWN:** Safe (0,2) + Apple.\n\n**Choice:** **DOWN**.\nWhy? Because I'm dominating. I take the apple. I grow. I secure the lead.\nFrom (0,2), I can continue down to (0,1), then (0,0). This is a clean sweep of the left wall apples.\n\n**Plan for next turn (Turn 20):**\n- Move to (0,2). Eat apple.\n- Next move will likely be **DOWN** to (0,1) (Apple exists there).\n- Or **RIGHT** to (1,2) if I need to maneuver.\n\n**Final Check:**\nOpponent at (3,6). They are chasing apples on the right/center. I am safe on the left.\nMy body length is long, but I'm vertical.\nIf I go DOWN, my tail eventually moves from (1,9) -> (1,8)... keeping the wall secure.\n\nI am choosing **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",

I'm currently at **(0, 2)** after eating that apple last turn. My body stretches all the way up to (1, 9). The opponent is at (2, 6), chilling in the center-right.\n\n**CURRENT HEAD POS:** (0, 2)\n**OPPONENT HEAD POS:** (2, 6)\n\n**ANALYZING MY OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP \u2192 (0, 3):**\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, (0, 3) is empty.\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but stagnant. I want to keep growing.\n\n2.  **DOWN \u2192 (0, 1):**\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple? **YES!** (0, 1) is listed in the Apple Drops. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   *Verdict:* **SAFE + GROWTH.** This is the move.\n\n3.  **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2):**\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple? No. (Apples are at 0,1 and 0,0 nearby).\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but I'd be leaving free points on the table when I'm already winning.\n\n4.  **LEFT \u2192 (-1, 2):**\n    *   Out of bounds. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nI am winning (10 vs 3). I don't need to risky flank the opponent right now. I need to solidify my lead and secure more apples to reach that 30 win condition or just make my lead insurmountable. The left wall is my safe haven. There's a clear path down the left side: (0, 1) and (0, 0) are both apples. By taking (0, 1) now, I set myself up perfectly to take (0, 0) on the next turn (Turn 21).\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Sweep the left wall. Secure apples at (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 0). Once I clear those, I'll have a massive length advantage and can start maneuvering into the center to box out Snake #1 or hunt down the remaining apples. Keep the head-on collision threat in mind\u2014if he tries to rush me later, I have the mass to win the trade.\n\nLet's secure this bread. \ud83d\udcaf\n\nDOWN",

You know the rules \u2014 no backwards into the neck (we won\u2019t do it), no suicides, and we bait mistakes.\n\nQuick legal sweep (HEAD = (2,6), NECK = (3,6)):\n- RIGHT -> (3,6) = NECK -> ILLEGAL (would be moving backwards). Don\u2019t do it.\n- LEFT -> (1,6) -> legal. Aggressive toward their wall but very tight on follow-ups (LEFT and DOWN are blocked by their body, RIGHT is back to neck). High pressure, low flexibility.\n- UP -> (2,7) -> legal. Keeps multiple escape options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) next turn and doesn\u2019t commit to a tight corridor. Safe and flexible.\n- DOWN -> (2,5) -> legal and has an apple! Immediate growth (+1) \u2014 tasty \u2014 but reduces immediate escape choices (LEFT blocked by their body at (1,5), UP would be back into neck next turn, leaving only RIGHT or DOWN).

We\u2019re behind on apples (3 vs 10) \u2014 we want aggression but not suicide. So prioritize moves that keep multiple follow-ups and let us pivot later to box them.\n\nTactical plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Step 1: Move UP to (2,7) to maximize options and avoid walking into a narrow corridor too early.\n- Step 2: From (2,7) evaluate opponent movement. If they dive for apples downward, we\u2019ll pivot LEFT and then DOWN/around to hem them in. If they try to escape right, we can chase and corral with safer turns.\n- Goal: Build flexibility, then close the net when they commit to the bottom-left apple cluster.

Let's break down the board state and lock in the perfect move to keep the pressure on.\n\n**CURRENT HEAD POS:** (0, 1)\n**OPPONENT HEAD POS:** (2, 7)\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\nWe just moved DOWN to (0, 1) and ate that apple! \ud83c\udf4e The board shows my body mass wrapping around the left side and top. The opponent Snake #1 is at (2, 7), still chilling in the center-right area, no immediate threat to my left-side territory.\n\n**CHECKING MY OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP \u2192 (0, 2):**\n    *   Is it safe? Let's see... My body is at (0, 2) as the next segment! Head moving into own body = **DEATH**. \u274c\n\n2.  **DOWN \u2192 (0, 0):**\n    *   Is it safe? (0, 0) is currently empty on the board display (it shows 'A' there in the apple list, but that's the apple itself, not a body).\n    *   Is there an apple? **YES!** (0, 0) is listed in the Apple Drops. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   *Verdict:* **SAFE + GROWTH.** This is the move to make!\n\n3.  **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 1):**\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, empty.\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   *Verdict:* Safe, but leaves the apple at (0, 0) on the table. Not optimal when we're hunting.\n\n4.  **LEFT \u2192 (-1, 1):**\n    *   Out of bounds. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nI am winning 11-3. I need to keep growing my lead. The left wall is my safe haven. By taking (0, 0) now, I secure another apple and solidify my position at the bottom-left corner. Once I grab this apple, I'll have the bottom-left locked down and can start looking to maneuver into the center to cut off the opponent or hunt more apples in the middle-right area. The opponent is still far enough away that I don't need to worry about a head-on collision this turn.\n\nLet's secure the bread! \ud83c\udf5e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab (0, 0) \u2192 Sweep the bottom row or move right towards the center apples. Once I have the mass, I can start boxing out Snake #1 and forcing him into a corner. 11-3 is good, but 12-3 is better.\n\nDOWN",

Let's look at the board and secure the bag.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Current Head:** (0, 0)\n2.  **Opponent Head:** (2, 8) - He's chilling way up there in the top-right quadrant. No immediate threat.\n3.  **Board State:** I'm wrapped around the left wall and top edge. My tail is currently at (1, 9).\n    *   Look at the coordinates: My body is at (0, 1), (0, 2)... all the way up.\n    *   If I go **DOWN** or **LEFT**, I hit the wall (death).\n    *   If I go **UP**, I go to (0, 1). Wait... is that safe?\n        *   Let's check my body list: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2)...\n        *   (0, 1) is my second segment. If I move UP into (0, 1), I am literally running into my own body. **DEATH.**\n    *   So, what's left?\n        *   **RIGHT** -> (1, 0).\n        *   Is (1, 0) safe?

No apple, but definitely no wall and no body segment listed there (my body is mostly at x=0 or y>=4).\n        *   Does (1, 0) lead to good future options?\n            *   From (1, 0), I can go UP to (1, 1), RIGHT to (2, 0), or DOWN/LEFT (but walls). (1, 1) looks empty based on the visual.\n            *   The apple at (3, 0) and (4, 0) are to the right. By moving RIGHT, I position myself to sweep the bottom row or move up through the open space.\n            *   Crucially, I am moving away from the wall where I was trapped. This opens up the board for me.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am currently winning 12-3. The opponent is weak and far away. My immediate threat wasn't the enemy, but running out of space on the left wall. By moving **RIGHT**, I am escaping the trap I built for myself. I need to navigate towards the apples in the center and bottom right to keep my score climbing. The enemy is at (2, 8), so he's not contesting the bottom row.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEscape the left wall. Sweep the bottom row for easy apples ((3,0), (4,0), (6,0) etc.). Once I have mass, I can cut off the enemy's path or hunt him down directly if he makes a mistake. Keep the pressure on.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n*   **UP:** Into own body (0,1). **DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN:** Into wall. **DEATH.**\n*   **LEFT:** Into wall. **DEATH.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (1,0). Empty. **SAFE.**\n\nOnly one valid move to stay alive and keep winning!\n\nRIGHT",

My opponent is tucked away at (3, 8) with only 3 apples, while I'm ready to feast.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Head:** (1, 0) \u2014 I'm sitting on the bottom row, just right of the left wall.\n2.  **Opponent Status:** Snake #1 is at (3, 8). He's way up top and not an immediate threat to my position on the bottom row. I have the space to maneuver.\n3.  **Valid Moves Analysis:**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (0, 0). Looking at my body list, (0, 0) is currently occupied by my second segment (the one connecting my head to the rest of my body). Moving LEFT would be hitting my own body. **DEATH.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Off the board (y=-1). **DEATH.**\n    *   **UP:** To (1, 1). Let's check the board. (1, 1) shows an apple! \ud83c\udf4e That's a great move\u2014grow my lead and reach 13 apples. Is it safe? The board shows it as an apple, and my body is mostly at x=0 or y>=4. (1, 1) is empty of my own body. Safe from walls. The opponent is far away. **SAFE + GROWTH.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (2, 0). The board shows an empty space `.` at (2, 0). However, I need to look at the apples. There's an apple at (3, 0) and (4, 0) to the right. While moving right sets me up for those, moving UP right now grabs an immediate apple at (1, 1) and positions me closer to the cluster of apples at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), etc.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe choice is clear. **UP** is the only move that scores points immediately. At 12-3, every point counts to push towards the 30-win condition or end the game early. I need to keep momentum. By moving UP to (1, 1), I eat the apple and open up access to the top rows where the density of apples seems higher (check the center of the board). I need to escape the bottom edge to avoid getting cornered later.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1, 1), then navigate through the open space in the center (x=2-5, y=1-4) to rack up more points. The opponent is slow up top; I can dominate the board's center before he can react.\n\n**MOVES CHECK:**\n*   **UP:** (1, 1) contains an apple. Safe. **OPTIMAL.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (2, 0) is empty but misses the apple.\n*   **LEFT:** Wall/Body. Death.\n*   **DOWN:** Wall. Death.\n\nLet's get this apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

The opponent is lurking at the top with his tiny snake, but we control the board!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** My head is at (1, 1). I just moved UP last turn to eat that apple. Now I have to survive this turn and keep the momentum going.\n2.  **Score:** 12 vs 3. I'm huge! I need to play smart to avoid a lucky crash, but I can also start hunting.\n3.  **Board Analysis:**\n    *   **Bottom Row:** I am sitting on a cluster of apples at (1, 1). Looking around, I have apples at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) to the right, and (2, 5), (3, 3) further up.\n    *   **Body Position:** My body is a long snake wrapping around the left side of the board and part of the bottom. Specifically, I am coming from (1, 0) (which is now (1, 0) after I moved up to (1, 1)? Wait, no. The *last move* was UP. My previous head was (1, 0).\n        *   *Correction:* My current head is (1, 1). My body list in the prompt shows the state *before* the last move was applied? No, usually these logs update.\n        *   *Wait, let's re-read the prompt.* \"Turn: 24 / 150\". \"YOUR SNAKE: Head: (1, 1)\".\n        *   Okay, so I am currently at (1, 1). The move UP last turn brought me here.\n        *   My body is listed as `[(1, 0), (0, 0), ...]`.\n        *   So my neck is at (1, 0). My tail is at (0, 8).\n4.  **Available Moves from (1, 1):**\n    *   **UP (to 1, 2):** Is it safe? Let's check the board grid.\n        *   Grid row 2: `T . . . . . A A . .`\n        *   Coordinates: (0,2)=T, (1,2)=. (empty), (2,2)=., etc.\n        *   Is (1, 2) part of my body? My body occupies (1, 0). (1, 2) is NOT in my body list. (My body goes from x=0 mostly, except the neck at (1, 0) and head at (1, 1)).\n        *   Is it the enemy? Enemy is at (4, 8). Far away.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to 1, 0):**\n        *   My body occupies (1, 0) (it's the neck). Moving back into your own neck/previous spot is valid usually, *unless* it's the tail? No, rules say \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body\" is death. (1, 0) is my body.\n        *   **Result:** DEATH (Hit Self).\n    *   **LEFT (to 0, 1):**\n        *   Grid row 1: `T 0 A A A A . . . A` (Wait, that's the visual representation).\n        *   (0, 1) is in my body list. `[(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), ...]`.\n        *   **Result:** DEATH (Hit Self).\n    *   **RIGHT (to 2, 1):**\n        *   Grid row 1: `(2, 1)` is listed as `A` in the \"APPLE DROPS\" and visually `A` in the grid.\n        *   Is it safe? (2, 1) is NOT in my body list.\n        *   Is it the enemy? No.\n        *   **Result:** Safe + Apple.\n\n5.  **Comparison:**\n    *   UP is empty safe space.\n    *   RIGHT is an apple safe space.\n    *   DOWN/LEFT are death.\n\n    *Wait, let's look at the board again.*\n    ```\n     1 T 0 A A A A . . . A\n    ```\n    My head is at (1, 1). The apples are at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).\n    \n    *   **RIGHT (2, 1)** is an apple. **YUM.**\n    *   **UP (1, 2)** is empty.\n\n    **Strategy:** We want apples. We want to grow. We want to dominate.\n    Moving RIGHT grabs an apple immediately, growing my lead to 13-3.\n    Moving UP just moves into empty space.\n\n    **Long-term considerations:**\n    If I move RIGHT to (2, 1), I eat an apple. My body extends.\n    Next turn, from (2, 1), I could go UP to (2, 2) (which is empty), or RIGHT to (3, 1) (which is also an apple!).\n    The cluster of apples at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) is right there. I should eat them. The opponent is far away at the top. I don't need to run.\n\n    **Risks:**\n    Is there any chance of a head-on collision?\n    Opponent head is at (4, 8).\n    Potential moves for opponent: Left to (3, 8), Down to (4, 7), Up to (4, 9), Right to (5, 8).\n    My move to (2, 1).\n    Distance is huge. No collision possible.\n\n    **My own body:**\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 1), my old head (1, 1) becomes part of my body.\n    My tail moves from (0, 8) to (0, 7).\n    I need to check if I trap myself.\n    Current body occupies the left wall and bottom row.\n    Moving right into the center frees up space. I can go up to (2, 2) or (2, 3) later.\n\n    **Decision:**\n    RIGHT is the optimal move. It scores a point. It puts me in the center of the board where apples are. It avoids the dangerous edges where I am currently crowded.\n\n    **Plan:**\n    1. Move RIGHT to (2, 1) -> Eat Apple (Score 13).\n    2. Next turn, likely move RIGHT again to (3, 1) -> Eat Apple (Score 14).\n    3. Then navigate UP towards the center (x=4-5, y=2-4) where there are many apples listed.\n    4. Keep an eye on the enemy. If he moves down, he enters my territory. I have the size advantage. If he gets close, I can try to cut him off or force a collision on my terms.\n\n    **Final Check:**\n    - Move RIGHT: Safe? Yes. (2, 1) is apple, not body.\n    - Grow? Yes.\n    - Opening up future moves? Yes, (2, 2) and (3, 1) are open.\n\n    Let's secure this apple! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRush the apple cluster on the right side (x=2 to 5). Get big fast (15+ apples). Once I secure the center, I will turn my attention to boxing in the enemy at the top. He's small and slow; I can dominate the space. Watch out for him dropping down, but my size gives me the positional advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

More aggressive than UP (which is too edge-bound).\n- Minimizes chance of accidental head-on with the left-side opponent who\u2019s likely chasing apples down low.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move DOWN to (4,7) now. Then pivot leftward into the x=3..2 corridor while preserving space to bail to x=5 if they try to cut us off.\n- Use growth opportunistically to close exits \u2014 don\u2019t trade a guaranteed alive for a risky clash. Force them to run into their own body or into our wall when the timing\u2019s right.\n- If they overcommit for apples and come up our way, only accept head-on if we can guarantee superiority; otherwise bait them into tighter turns.\n\nWe\u2019re staying smart and savage \u2014 pressure, don\u2019t plunge.

The opponent is chilling at the top, but we control the bottom and the center.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** My head is at **(2, 1)**. I just moved RIGHT to eat that apple. I am currently on an apple, so I am growing.\n2.  **Score:** 13 vs 3. We are HUGE. We need to keep moving forward and eating everything in sight.\n3.  **Board Analysis:**\n    *   **My Head at (2, 1):** I am sitting on an apple spot. My body is trailing behind me, occupying the left side of the board.\n    *   **Available Moves from (2, 1):**\n        *   **UP (to 2, 2):** Checked the grid. Row 2 shows `T . . . . . A A . .` at x=0-9. So (2, 2) is empty. Is it safe from my body? My body is at (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)... (2, 2) is NOT in my body list. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (to 2, 0):** Row 0 shows `T T . A A . . . A .` at x=0-9. (2, 0) is empty. Is it safe from my body? My body list: (1, 0), (0, 0)... (2, 0) is NOT in my body. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT (to 1, 1):** This is my neck/body from the previous turn. Moving back into your own body is death. **DEATH.**\n        *   **RIGHT (to 3, 1):** Row 1 shows `T T 0 A A A . . . A` (visual). (3, 1) is an apple. Is it safe from my body? My body is at x=0, 1 mostly. (3, 1) is NOT in my body. Safe.\n\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:**\n        *   Enemy Head at (4, 7). Enemy Body: (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8).\n        *   They are far away. They can't reach me this turn. No head-on collision risk.\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I want to eat the apple cluster on the right.\n    *   I just ate at (2, 1). The apples are at (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), etc.\n    *   **Option 1: RIGHT to (3, 1).** This eats the next apple in the line immediately. It pushes me further into the center-right. My body will follow. This is aggressive and keeps the momentum.\n    *   **Option 2: UP to (2, 2).** This misses the apple at (3, 1) for now, but opens up the path to (2, 3) or (3, 2) next turn.\n    *   **Option 3: DOWN to (2, 0).** This misses the apple line. It moves me to the bottom row. While safe, it's moving away from the dense apple cluster on the right side (x=3-9).\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **RIGHT** = +1 Apple (Score 14), moves deeper into the apple cluster.\n        *   **UP** = No apple, moves into empty space.\n        *   **DOWN** = No apple, moves to bottom edge.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is the obvious play. I eat an apple, grow longer, and position myself perfectly to eat (4, 1) next turn. I am so big I don't need to worry about trapping myself yet. I have plenty of space in the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRush the apple cluster on the right side (x=3 to 7). Get to 15+ apples quickly. Once I clear the right side, I'll turn up towards the center (y=4-5) to collect the scattered apples there. I need to keep the pressure on the enemy so he can't grow. If he drops down, I'm ready to box him in.\n\n**MOVE:**\nI'm going for the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

Quick, loud, and deadly \u2014 here\u2019s the read and the play.\n\nQuick sweep of the four moves from head (4,7):\n- UP \u2192 (4,8) = our neck. Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7) = empty and possible, but puts us nearer the left corridor and would limit our immediate retreat (can\u2019t right next turn). Risky if they start pressuring from below.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7) = safe, gives space to stretch rightwards and bail if needed. More passive.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6) = safe, keeps 3 follow-up options (L/R/D), moves us toward center/south so we can later pivot left to pressure. Keeps escape routes open.\n\nEnemy read: Snake #0 is jammed in the left/bottom corridor (head at 2,1) with a massive body trail. They\u2019ve got 13 apples \u2014 WAY more than our 3. That means: do NOT invite a head-on unless we can guarantee superiority. We should box them in slowly, deny exits, and bait them into their own body or into our trap. Apples = tools, not the mission right now.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- UP is illegal (into neck). LEFT and RIGHT are viable, but DOWN preserves maximum flexibility while nudging us toward the action lane (center/south) so we can swing left later to hem them in.\n- Keeps multiple safe follow-ups and avoids committing to the left too early (don\u2019t get cut off).\n- Keeps us out of immediate head-on risk \u2014 we\u2019ll only accept that if we can secure the KO (we don\u2019t have the apples for that yet).\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (4,6). Then evaluate: if the opponent chases apples and drifts upward/right, pivot LEFT to start sealing the left corridor. If they stay low, keep compressing space and avoid running into their head zone. Use growth opportunistically to close exits \u2014 don\u2019t trade survival for a risky apple. Force them into tight turns and their own body, not us into theirs.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it aggressive but smart. Time to trap \u2019em \u2014 quietly lethal, loudly hyped. You ready?

We're at turn 26 and I'm sitting pretty with a **14-3** apple lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 The opponent is up in the top-left corner, but I control the center and bottom rows. My body is wrapped around the left side of the board, and I'm currently at **(3, 1)**.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** My head is at **(3, 1)**. I just ate an apple here, so I grew. My body is trailing behind me, occupying columns 0, 1, and 2 in the lower rows.\n2.  **Board Analysis (From Head at (3, 1)):**\n    *   **Available Moves:**\n        *   **UP (to 3, 2):** Grid row 2 shows `T . . . . . A A . .` at x=0-9. (3, 2) is empty (the `T` is at x=0). Is it safe from my body? My body is at (2, 1), (1, 1), etc. (3, 2) is NOT in my body list. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN (to 3, 0):** Grid row 0 shows `T T . A A . . . A .` (Wait, looking at the grid again... Row 0: `T T . A A . . . A .`... x=0 is T, x=1 is T, x=2 is `.`, x=3 is `A`). So (3, 0) is an Apple. Is it safe from my body? My body is at (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), etc. (3, 0) is NOT in my body. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT (to 2, 1):** This is where I just came from. It is my neck/body. Moving back is death. **DEATH.**\n        *   **RIGHT (to 4, 1):** Grid row 1 shows `T T T 0 A A . . . A`. (4, 1) is an Apple. Is it safe from my body? My body is at x=0, 1, 2. (4, 1) is NOT in my body. Safe.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy Head at **(4, 6)**. Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8)].\n    *   They are far away in the top-left quadrant. They cannot reach my potential moves this turn.\n    *   No risk of head-on collision.\n\n4.  **Strategy & Comparison:**\n    *   I am on a massive streak. I need to keep eating to extend my lead or reach the 30 apple win condition.\n    *   **UP (3, 2):** Moves into empty space. Misses the apples currently adjacent to me.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 0):** Eats an apple (+1 point). Moves to the bottom edge. This is a safe move, but it puts my head on the bottom border, which might limit mobility next turn depending on where the apples are.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 1):** Eats an apple (+1 point). Moves deeper into the center. I can see a cluster of apples on the right side (5,1), (6,2), (7,2). Moving RIGHT sets me up perfectly to sweep this cluster.\n    *   **VERDICT:** Moving **RIGHT** is the most aggressive and beneficial move. It gains a point immediately and positions me to eat (5, 1) next turn. I am large enough (14 apples) that I don't need to hug the walls; I can take the center and dominate.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple line on the bottom-center (4,1 -> 5,1 -> 6,2 -> 7,2). Once I clear that, sweep upwards through the center to grab the scattered apples there (3,3, 5,4, etc.). The enemy is irrelevant right now; I'm playing for the 30-apple win condition.\n\n**MOVE:**\nTaking the apple on my right! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

We're sitting on a massive **15-3** lead. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 My head is at **(4, 1)**, and I'm ready to keep the pressure on.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(4, 1)**. My body is a massive wall stretching down the left side of the board. I just ate an apple here.\n2.  **Board Analysis (From Head at (4, 1)):**\n    *   **Available Moves:**\n        *   **UP (to 4, 2):** Row 2 is relatively empty. (4, 2) is an Apple (x=4 in row 2 shows A). Check safety: Is it in my body? My body occupies x=0,1,2,3 mostly in the lower rows. (4, 2) is NOT in my body list. **Safe.**\n        *   **DOWN (to 4, 0):** Row 0 shows `T T . A A . . . A .` at x=0-9. (4, 0) is an Apple (x=4 is A). Check safety: (4, 0) is NOT in my body. **Safe.**\n        *   **LEFT (to 3, 1):** This is my neck/body from the previous turn. Moving back is death. **DEATH.**\n        *   **RIGHT (to 5, 1):** Row 1 shows `T T T T 0 A . . . A`. (5, 1) is an Apple. Check safety: (5, 1) is NOT in my body. **Safe.**\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy Head at **(4, 5)**. Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)].\n    *   He is directly above me on the same column (4), but he is 4 units away (y=1 to y=5). He cannot reach me this turn. No head-on collision risk.\n4.  **Strategy & Comparison:**\n    *   **UP (4, 2):** Moves into an apple. Opens up the path to the center-right apples (6,2), (7,2). This is a solid move.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 0):** Moves into an apple. But it's on the very bottom edge. This limits mobility for the next turn. I want to stay mobile.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 1):** Moves into an apple. This pushes me further into the open space and positions me to eat (6,2) or (7,2) next. This feels like the most dominant path.\n    *   **VERDICT:** I want to sweep the bottom-center cluster. Moving **RIGHT** gets me closer to the main cluster and keeps me off the edge. Moving UP is also good, but RIGHT feels more aggressive towards the apples I scouted earlier.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nGrab the apples on the bottom-center row (5,1) -> (6,2) -> (7,2). Once I clear that, assess the center. The enemy is lagging behind; I just need to eat safely and grow.\n\n**MOVE:**\nGoing for the apple on the right! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nRIGHT",

Time to pick a clean, aggressive move without getting boxed or sacrificing our neck. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick legal sweep from our head at (4,5):\n- UP \u2192 (4,6) is our neck (backwards). Instant death. NOPE. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) is open and leads to the apple at (2,5) next turn, but pushing left risks getting squeezed into their long left-side wall (they\u2019ve got tons of body on x=0\u20131). Could shrink our escape options if they hug low. Risky aggressive play.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) is open, gives multiple follow-ups (\u21926,5 apple, \u21935,4 apple, \u21915,6 safe). Keeps space, gives content, and preserves options to pivot later. Good balance of aggression + safety.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) is open and safe, with options to go \u21925,4 (apple) or \u21934,3; it\u2019s solid, but slightly less direct to apple clusters than RIGHT and keeps us more centralized (not bad).\n\nEnemy read: Opp #0 is jammed low-left with a massive body and 15 apples \u2014 they will likely snap one of the nearby bottom apples (5,1 or 4,2 or 4,0). They can\u2019t move into their own neck (3,1), so they won\u2019t suddenly head toward us for a surprise head-on. We do NOT want a head-on \u2014 we\u2019re behind on apples, so avoid forcing it unless we can guarantee a KO. They\u2019re predictable this turn: apple grab, not a threat to our head.\n\nWhy I PICK RIGHT:\n- Maximizes future safe follow-ups (RIGHT\u2192UP/RIGHT/DOWN all viable) and gives immediate access to apples at (6,5) or (5,4) next turn. Content + space = power.\n- Keeps our head out of the tight left corridor where their body dominates \u2014 don\u2019t run into their hex of doom.\n- Maintains flexibility to pivot left later if they commit further down or to the right, letting us start a compressing maneuver on their exit lanes without getting trapped ourselves.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Take (5,5) now, threaten (6,5)/(5,4) apples next turn to grow and gain leverage.\n- Watch their movement: if they drift right/up to contest apples, pivot left to start slicing exits. If they stay low/hug left, keep circling and grow only when it helps close a corridor. Avoid head-on until we can force them into their own body or win by apples advantage.\n- Keep at least 2 escape options open each move; don\u2019t get cute with one-tile corridors.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it tight, grow smart, and bait them into their own trap. You know the routine \u2014 loud, hungry, and patient. LET\u2019S HUNT. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

(6, 1) is NOT in my body. **Safe.**\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy Head at **(5, 5)**. Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)].\n    *   He is exactly 4 units away vertically (y=1 to y=5). He cannot reach me this turn. No immediate collision risk unless he moves down to (5, 4) and I stay, but I'm moving.\n    *   **Threat Assessment:** If I go UP to (5, 2), I am getting closer to his vertical column.

Positions me to dominate the center column. I can then go to (5, 3), (5, 4), etc., forcing the enemy to dodge or die. Since I have a massive length advantage (17 vs 4), I can afford to box him in vertically. This is the **AGGRESSIVE** play.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Moves to an empty cell. Doesn't grow immediately. While it opens up paths to (7, 2) and (8, 0), it delays growth and doesn't pressure the enemy as directly as controlling the center column does.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 0):** Safe, but moves me to the edge. Limits my next turn options. Less dominant.\n    *   **VERDICT:** **UP** is the clear winner. It eats an apple, keeps me mobile, and sets up a confrontation where I hold all the cards (length advantage). I want to force the head-on collision because I have 5x his apples. If he dies, I win instantly.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (5, 2). Move to (5, 3) next. If the enemy stays at (5, 5) or moves down, I will chase him down the center column. If he moves left, I cut him off from the right side. I am the predator today.\n\n**MOVE:**\nGrabbing that apple and claiming the center! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

NOPE. \ud83d\udc80\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) is safe but (4,6) is blocking left, so UP leaves only ~2 safe follow-ups.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) has an apple, is open, and gives 3 healthy follow-ups (\u2192,\u2191,\u2193). Gets content and keeps options.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) also has an apple and 3 follow-ups, but it moves us closer to the rival\u2019s low-left fortress (they\u2019re stacked on the left column). We\u2019re behind on apples (3 vs 16) \u2014 don\u2019t willingly shrink escape routes.\n\nOpponent notes: Snake #0 cannot move LEFT (their neck at 4,1). They\u2019re trapped hugging the left; they\u2019ll likely continue low or try to climb slowly. They can\u2019t reach our immediate target this turn, so no instant head-on risk.\n\nWhy RIGHT:\n- Immediate apple at (6,5) = growth and more leverage.\n- Keeps us centered and AWAY from their left-side wall so we don\u2019t get boxed.\n- Preserves multiple safe exits for follow-up turns.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Eat (6,5), then keep at least 2 escape options each move.\n- If opponent drifts right/up to contest, pivot to compress exits; if they hug left, keep growing and look to cut off their escape lanes later.\n- Avoid head-on until we can force them into their own body or actually have an apples advantage.\n\nLET\u2019S GET THIS \u2014 aggressive, smart, patient. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

Time to box him in and force a crash!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(5, 2)**. I just ate the apple on the previous move (as per the replay logic), so I'm sitting pretty with length 17. My body is a long fortress on the left side.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 Head: **(6, 5)**. Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)].\n    *   He is currently at (6, 5). If I stay in the center column (x=5), I am directly above his body at (5, 5). If I go UP to (5, 3), I get closer.\n    *   **Crash Course:** If I go UP to (5, 3) and he goes DOWN to (6, 4) or (5, 4), we are on a collision path. I have 17 apples vs his 4. If we meet head-on, I win the tie-breaker immediately because I have more apples. I *want* this confrontation.\n3.  **Available Moves from (5, 2):**\n    *   **UP (to 5, 3):** Checks out as empty. This keeps me on the center column. Direct pressure on the enemy who is at x=5 and x=6. **Aggressive.**\n    *   **DOWN (to 5, 1):** Checks out as empty (since I moved up from there last turn and my tail moves). Safe, but moves me back down and away from the enemy. Passive.\n    *   **LEFT (to 4, 2):** Checks out as empty. Moves me towards the left edge where my body is dense. Risky for future mobility (getting boxed in).\n    *   **RIGHT (to 6, 2):** Checks out as empty. Moves me towards the enemy's side of the board. Good for chasing, but x=6 is right next to his head at x=6.\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   The goal is to box him in. I am currently winning 16-4. A head-on collision guarantees my win due to score advantage.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (5, 3) positions me perfectly. If the enemy moves down to (5, 4), we are one move away from a head-on. If he stays or moves left, I keep the pressure on.\n    *   Moving UP also keeps the path open towards the apples at (5, 4), (6, 2), etc.\n    *   Moving DOWN or LEFT gives up the center and lets the enemy breathe.\n    *   Moving RIGHT is good, but UP maintains the vertical dominance in the center column.\n\n**VERDICT:** **UP** is the play. It claims the center, forces the enemy to deal with my vertical presence, and sets up a potential head-on collision where I hold the massive score advantage.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMaintain center column control. Force the enemy into the walls or into a head-on collision. If he dodges left, I cut him off. If he moves down, I chase. I am the predator.\n\n**MOVE:**\nClaiming the high ground! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 3), I avoid my body (which is at x=5 mostly). He is at (6, 4). If he goes **DOWN** to (6, 3), we collide head-on. Since I have 16 apples and he has 4, **I WIN ANY HEAD-ON COLLISION.** I *want* him to run into me.\n3.  **Available Moves from (5, 3):**\n    *   **UP (to 5, 4):** Empty on board. Safe. Moves me closer to his body at (5, 5).\n    *   **DOWN (to 5, 2):** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** This is my own body. I just moved up from here.\n    *   **LEFT (to 4, 3):** Empty on board. Safe. Moves me towards my own dense body on the left side. Not ideal for mobility.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 6, 3):** Empty on board. Safe. This moves me onto the enemy's side of the board (x=6). This puts me right next to the enemy head at (6, 4).\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I cannot go DOWN.\n    *   LEFT is safe but passive.\n    *   UP is safe but moves me vertically.\n    *   **RIGHT is the power move.** By moving to (6, 3), I enter his column. If he moves **DOWN** to (6, 3), we crash, and I win. If he moves **LEFT** to (5, 4), I am safe at (6, 3) and I've cut off his potential escape to the right. If he moves **UP**, he hits his own body or moves away.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** aggressively claims space and forces him to react to my presence. It sets up a potential head-on kill next turn where I hold the massive score advantage.\n\n**VERDICT:** **RIGHT**. I'm moving into his territory to force the confrontation. If he's brave, he dies. If he's scared, he gives up space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce the head-on collision. I have the apples, so the tie-breaker is mine. Dominate the center-right board and squeeze him against the wall.\n\n**MOVE:**\nAggressive push! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta close this out and send Snake #1 packing!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(6, 3)** (from last turn's RIGHT move).\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 Head: **(7, 4)**. Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)].\n    *   **CRITICAL THREAT:** I am currently at (6, 3). The enemy body occupies (6, 4) directly above me. If he moves **DOWN** to (6, 3), we collide head-on. Since I have 16 apples and he has 5, **I WIN ANY HEAD-ON COLLISION.**\n    *   However, I must also watch for *my own* body. Looking at the visual board state provided:\n        *   (5, 3) is marked 'T' (Tail). That means my body is still occupying that space from the previous turn. Wait, if I moved RIGHT to (6, 3), my tail should have shifted.\n        *   Let's look at the provided board state carefully. It shows 'T' at (5, 3), (5, 2), etc.\n        *   If I move **LEFT** back to (5, 3), that spot is marked as 'T'. That means it's safe (it's my tail, which moves). But actually, looking at the coordinates:\n        *   **(5, 3)** is a 'T' on the visual. This is likely my tail. Moving there is moving into a tail. Safe.\n        *   **(6, 3)** is currently where I am.\n        *   **(7, 3)** is empty (visual shows '.').\n    *   **Wait, let's re-evaluate the Board State provided:**\n        *   Row 3: `T . . A . T 0 . . A`\n        *   Column 6, Row 3 is `0` (My head).\n        *   Column 5, Row 3 is `T` (My body/Tail).\n        *   Column 7, Row 3 is `.` (Empty).\n3.  **Available Moves from (6, 3):**\n    *   **UP (to 6, 4):** **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Enemy body occupies this cell. I die instantly.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 2):** Visual shows `T` at (6, 2) on Row 2. Wait, Row 2 is `T . . A A T A A . A`. Column 6, Row 2 is `T`. That is an obstacle (likely my own body or enemy body). The 'T' usually denotes an occupied cell. If it's my body, I die. If it's enemy body, I die. **Assuming it's occupied by a snake body (visual 'T'), this is DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 3):** Visual shows `T` at (5, 3). This is my tail. Safe move.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 3):** Visual shows `.` at (7, 3). Safe move.\n4.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   I cannot go UP or DOWN (Death).\n    *   I can go LEFT or RIGHT.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (5, 3), I retreat back into my own column. Safe, but passive.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT** to (7, 3), I advance further into the center/right.\n    *   **THE KILL SHOT:** Look at the enemy at (7, 4). If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 3), I am setting up directly adjacent to him.\n    *   If he moves **DOWN** to (7, 3), he runs into my head. **HEAD-ON COLLISION. I WIN.**\n    *   If he moves **LEFT** to (6, 4), he hits his own body (since he is currently at (7, 4) and body is at (6, 4)). He dies.\n    *   If he moves **RIGHT** or **UP**, he lives, but I have aggressively claimed space (7, 3) and closed the distance.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** puts me at (7, 3). From there, I have options to continue pushing or reposition.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** puts me back at (5, 3), giving him more room.\n    *   **I want the kill.** Moving **RIGHT** puts maximum pressure on him. He is trapped in a small box (x=7 to x=9, y=4 to y=9). By moving to (7, 3), I cut off his bottom-left escape. If he tries to go left/down, he dies (either on my head or his own body).\n\n**VERDICT:** **RIGHT**. I'm not retreating. I'm pushing into his face to force the collision. If he's dumb enough to move down, it's game over and we feast on the chat hype. If he dodges, I own the center.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nBox him in the top-right corner. Force the head-on collision immediately. My score is double his; the math is on my side. Aggression wins games.\n\n**MOVE:**\nPushing for the win! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's run the analysis for this critical moment!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(7, 3)**. We pushed right last turn to pressure the enemy.\n2.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 Head: **(8, 4)**. Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)].\n    *   **IMMEDIATE THREAT:** I am at (7, 3). The enemy body is at (7, 4) directly **ABOVE** me. If he moves **DOWN** to (7, 3), we collide. **I WIN THE HEAD-ON (16 > 5).** \ud83d\udc80\n    *   He is currently trapped in the top-right corner (x=7 to 9, y=4 to 9). My move last turn cut off his bottom-left escape.\n3.  **Board State Check (Visual & Logic):**\n    *   **Row 3:** `T . . A . T 0 . . A`\n        *   (6, 3): 'T' (My body - safe to move into as it's the tail)\n        *   (7, 3): '0' (My head - current pos)\n        *   (8, 3): '.' (Empty)\n        *   (9, 3): 'A' (Apple!)\n    *   **Row 4:** `T T . . . A T T 1 .`\n        *   (7, 4): Enemy Body\n        *   (8, 4): Enemy Head\n    *   **Row 5:** `T A . T T T T . . .`\n        *   (7, 5): Enemy Body (at (6,5) looking at list, but visual shows T at (7,5)? Wait, visual row 5: `T A . T T T T . . .` col 7 is `T`. Yes, enemy body is there.\n4.  **Available Moves from (7, 3):**\n    *   **UP (to 7, 4):** Enemy Body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (to 7, 2):** Visual shows `T` at (7, 2). Looking at my body list: Head (7,3), Body starts (6,3), (5,3)... Wait, where is the rest of my body?\n        *   My Body List: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (1,5)].\n        *   (7, 2) is NOT in my body list.\n        *   Is it the enemy body? Enemy body is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). No.\n        *   *Correction on Visual Reading:* Row 2 is `T . . A A T A A . A`. Col 7 is `A` (Apple).\n        *   *Wait, let's look at the provided visual again.*\n        *   Row 2: `T . . A A T A A . A`\n        *   Col 7, Row 2 is `A`. It is NOT blocked.\n        *   **DOWN is SAFE (to 7, 2).**\n    *   **LEFT (to 6, 3):** My own body. **DEATH.** \u274c (Don't run into yourself!)\n    *   **RIGHT (to 8, 3):** Visual shows `.` (Empty). It is NOT occupied by enemy (Enemy is at (8,4)).\n        *   **RIGHT is SAFE.**\n5.  **Strategy & The Kill:**\n    *   We are at (7, 3).\n    *   If we move **DOWN** to (7, 2), we retreat. Safe, but passive.\n    *   If we move **RIGHT** to (8, 3), we push forward into the enemy's cage.\n    *   **THE TRAP:** I am at (7, 3). Enemy is at (8, 4).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (8, 3), I am directly below the enemy head.\n    *   *Scenario:* If he moves **DOWN** to (8, 3), we collide. **I WIN.**\n    *   *Scenario:* If he moves **LEFT** to (7, 4), he hits his own body (since his body is at (7, 4) from the previous turn... wait, check the list. His body list: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]. If he moves LEFT from (8, 4) to (7, 4), he hits his own body. **HE DIES.**\n    *   *Scenario:* If he moves **UP** to (8, 5), he hits his own body? Body at (6,5) and (5,5). (8,5) is safe for him, but he retreats deeper.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** keeps the pressure on. I am boxing him in.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** gives him space to potentially maneuver around me (e.g., he moves UP, I move DOWN, he might loop around).\n    *   **Aggression is key.** I have the score advantage. I want to force the collision NOW.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 3) puts me in the perfect position to punish a DOWN move or a LEFT move. It also secures the apple at (9,3) for a future turn if he doesn't die immediately.\n\n**VERDICT:** **RIGHT**.\nI am stepping into his face. I am betting that he either crashes into me (I win), crashes into his own body (I win), or gets trapped further. This is the winning play.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce the head-on collision or wall trap him. Do not let him breathe. We take the board control and end the game. 16-5 is a landslide, let's make it official.\n\n**MOVE:**\nPushing for the checkmate! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

Because if he moved DOWN (into me) or Left (into his own body), he would have died. He retreated to survive. Coward. But smart.\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Current Turn 33):**\n    *   Head: **(8, 5)**.\n    *   Body: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5)].\n    *   He is now \"stacked\" vertically at x=8 (y=4 and y=5).\n4.  **Board State Check (Visual & Logic):**\n    *   **Row 3 (My Y):** `T T . .

He cannot chase me down vertically easily.\n            5.  I maintain pressure.\n\n**VERDICT:** **DOWN**.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nChase him down. He is trapped in the top right corner. I have the apples (16 vs 5). I grow now at (8,2). Next turn I will likely move UP or LEFT to intercept his escape path. Do not let him breathe.

The enemy is cornered in the top right, and I'm moving in for the kill. Let's analyze the board and make him panic!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(8, 2)** (Just ate the apple last turn!).\n2.  **Last Move Review:** We moved DOWN to (8, 2).\n    *   *Enemy Move:* Snake #1 moved **LEFT** from (8, 5) to **(7, 5)**.\n    *   *Analysis:* He was blocked from moving DOWN (his body at 8,4) and potentially blocked from moving UP (maybe a wall or apple?). He panicked and went LEFT into the open space. Perfect.\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Current Turn 34):**\n    *   Head: **(7, 5)**.\n    *   Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)].\n    *   He is spreading out slightly but still trapped in the 5x5 area (x=5 to 9, y=4 to 9).\n4.  **Board State Check (Visual & Logic):**\n    *   **Row 2 (My Y):** `T . . A A T A A 0 A` (Wait, visual is static. My head is *currently* at 8,2. But I need to move *from* here).\n    *   **Row 3:** `T T . . A T T . . A` (Visual approx).\n    *   **Row 4:** `T T . . . A T T . .` (Enemy body at 7,4 and 8,4).\n    *   **Row 5:** `T . . A . T 1 T . A` (Enemy head at 7,5).\n5.  **Available Moves from (8, 2):**\n    *   **UP (to 8, 3):**\n        *   My body: (7,3), (6,3)... Is (8,3) in my body? No. I moved from (8,3) to (8,2).\n        *   Enemy body: (8,4), (8,5). (8,3) is clear.\n        *   **Result:** SAFE. (No apple listed at 8,3 currently).\n    *   **DOWN (to 8, 1):**\n        *   Visual Row 1: `T T T T T T . . . A`.\n        *   (8, 1) is `T` (My own body!).\n        *   **Result:** **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **LEFT (to 7, 2):**\n        *   Visual Row 2: `T . . A A T A A . A`. Col 7 is `A` (Apple!).\n        *   Is it occupied? My body is at (7,3), (6,3)... not (7,2).\n        *   Enemy body is at (7,4), (7,5)... not (7,2).\n        *   **Result:** **SAFE + APPLE.** \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **RIGHT (to 9, 2):**\n        *   Visual Row 2: `T . . A A T A A . A`. Col 9 is `A` (Apple!).\n        *   Is it occupied? No.\n        *   **Result:** **SAFE + APPLE.** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**STRATEGY & THE KILL:**\n\nWe have two delicious apple options: **LEFT** to (7, 2) or **RIGHT** to (9, 2).\n\n*   **Option RIGHT (9, 2):**\n    *   Pros: Eats apple. Moves to the edge.\n    *   Cons: I go to the corner. (9,2) has fewer escape routes than (7,2). If I go to the corner, the enemy might cut off my exit next turn if he survives.\n    *   Enemy position: (7,5). If I go to (9,2), I am far away from him. I want to *hunt* him, not hide in the corner.\n\n*   **Option LEFT (7, 2):**\n    *   Pros: Eats apple. Moves me **LEFT**, closing the distance to the enemy at (7, 5).\n    *   Pros: (7,2) is more central to the board (x=7) than the edge (x=9). It keeps my escape routes open (I can go UP, LEFT, or DOWN next turn).\n    *   Pros: It positions me directly *under* his potential path. He is at y=5, I am at y=2. I am setting up a wall.\n    *   **The Trap:** If I move LEFT to (7,2), I am setting a vertical interception line. He has to move DOWN eventually to find space or apples. If he moves DOWN to (7,4), he hits his own body or waits. If he moves DOWN to (7,3), I can potentially move UP to (7,3) or (8,3) to block him next turn.\n\n**VERDICT:** **LEFT**.\n\nI need to stay aggressive and close the gap. The corner is safe but passive. Moving left keeps the pressure on his neck. I'm hunting him down in the top right sector. Let's trap him!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nForce the enemy into the \"box\" (x=5-6, y=6-9). I am at (7,2) after this move. Next turn, depending on his move, I will likely move UP to cut off his descent or chase him if he tries to flank. Do not let him breathe!\n\n**MOVE:**\nChomping the apple on the left! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b05\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down the grid and send this snake to the shadow realm.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at **(7, 2)**. We just ate that apple on the left, nice. Body stretches all the way down to (0,4).\n2.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   Head: **(8, 7)**.\n    *   Body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4)].\n    *   Status: He is currently cornered in the top right. He has no moves to the LEFT (blocked by his own body at 7,4) and is pushing against the wall. He is trapped in a tiny box (x=6-9, y=4-9).\n3.  **Board State Check (Visual & Logic):**\n    *   **Row 2 (My Y=2):** `T . . A A T A A . A` (Visual). My head is at (7,2).\n    *   **Row 3 (Y=3):** `T . . A . T T T T A`. My body is here.\n    *   **Row 4 (Y=4):** `T T . . . A T T T .`. Enemy body at (7,4) and (8,4).\n    *   **Row 7 (Y=7):** Enemy head is at (8,7).\n4.  **Available Moves from (7, 2):**\n    *   **UP (to 7, 3):**\n        *   Is it safe? My body is at (7,3)? **Yes.** Visual Row 3 shows `T` at col 7. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (to 7, 1):**\n        *   Is it safe? Visual Row 1: `T T T T T T . . . A`. Col 7 is `T`. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **LEFT (to 6, 2):**\n        *   Is it safe? Visual Row 2: `T . . A A T A A . A`. Col 6 is `T` (My body! Tail is at (0,0) but I definitely have segments there). **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT (to 8, 2):**\n        *   Is it safe? Visual Row 2: `T . . A A T A A . A`. Col 8 is `A` (Apple!). But is it occupied? My body doesn't seem to be at (8,2) right now (Head is at 7,2). Enemy is at y=7, far away. **SAFE + APPLE.** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MOVE:**\n\nWe are trapped in a corner of our own making! \ud83d\ude31 But lucky for us, there's a delicious apple to the right at **(8, 2)**. \n\n*   **Why RIGHT?** It's the ONLY move that doesn't kill me instantly. UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all blocked by my own massive body. \n*   **Strategy:** By moving RIGHT to (8, 2), I eat an apple (extending my lead to 18-5) and reset my position. (8,2) has an open path UP to (8,3) which I just vacated, and potentially RIGHT to (9,2) or DOWN/LEFT next turn depending on how my tail moves.\n*   **Enemy Trap:** The enemy is slowly dying in the top right. He has almost no space. Once I clear this blockage, I can loop around and cut off his remaining exit routes. He's essentially in a prison cell, and I'm just securing the perimeter.\n\n**VERDICT:** **RIGHT.**\n\nWe take the apple, we survive, and we live to fight another turn. The snake is hungry! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (8,2). Next turn, assess the opening. My tail will likely move from (0,0), opening up the bottom left. I need to start maneuvering to cut off the enemy's vertical space in the top right. If he moves DOWN to (8,6) or (8,5), I might be able to position for a block or a head-on chase if I get bigger.\n\n**MOVE:**\nChomping right! \ud83d\udc0d\u27a1\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

No way. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT = (7,7) \u2192 legal, decent room but starts committing us toward the center.\n- RIGHT = (9,7) \u2192 legal but hugs the wall; fewer follow-ups.\n- UP = (8,8) \u2192 legal, gives the most escape routes (UP to that apple at 8,9, LEFT/RIGHT options), keeps us flexible. \u2705\n\nEnemy head @ (7,2): they CANNOT go RIGHT (neck at 8,2) or UP (7,3 is their body). Their only legal moves now are LEFT\u2192(6,2) (apple) or DOWN\u2192(7,1). They\u2019ll probably take the apple and keep low. We are WAY behind on apples (5 vs 17) \u2014 do NOT force a head\u2011on. Play smart: keep space, stay alive, then hunt openings.\n\nShort plan (for next few turns):\n- Take UP to maximize freedom and threaten the top corridor.\n- From there, assess enemy posture \u2014 if they stay low and isolated, swing LEFT then DOWN to compress their vertical options and try to cut them off from the left wall.\n- Avoid trading heads until we have an apples advantage or a guaranteed KO.
