My current body only has one segment, so I'm taking a risk by going for it straight away.\n\nThinking out loud, we could potentially miss if we don't time it perfectly, getting stuck at y-coordinate 1 instead of moving up to (0,2). But at this point, we really need to eat an apple to grow and stay competitive.\n\nIf we manage to snag the apple at (0,2), it should give us two new snake parts, allowing us to safely move away and assess our next move. With that in mind, here's my strategy for next turn:\n\n1. Eat the apple at (0,2) if possible \n2. If we grow, move EAST (right) to some empty space\n3. Once we have more body segments, consider the bigger picture and look for a path to more apples or safer food sources\n\nFor now, let's focus on the immediate goal. Here's my decided move:\nDOWN",
