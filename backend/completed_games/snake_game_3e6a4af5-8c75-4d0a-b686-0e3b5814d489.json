However, I must avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 0) is at head (5,1) with no body.\n\nApples are at: (9,7), (4,3), (2,6), (8,3), (5,0)\n\nNow, consider each possible move from (1,4):\n\n- UP: (1,5) - This is within bounds (0-9). No snake is there currently. But note: enemy snake is at (5,1) far away. So safe.\n- DOWN: (1,3) - Within bounds. No snake there. Safe.\n- LEFT: (0,4) - Within bounds. No snake there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,4) - Within bounds. No snake there. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. Now, which one is best for getting apples and future options?\n\nApples nearby:\n- (4,3) is at x=4,y=3. From (1,4), going DOWN to (1,3) gets closer to it? Actually, (1,3) is closer to (4,3) than (1,4)? Manhattan distance: from (1,4) to (4,3) is |1-4|+|4-3|=3+1=4. From (1,3) to (4,3)=|1-4|+|3-3|=3+0=3. So DOWN reduces distance to (4,3).\n- (2,6) is at x=2,y=6. UP to (1,5) gets closer? From (1,4) to (2,6)=|1-2|+|4-6|=1+2=3. From (1,5) to (2,6)=|1-2|+|5-6|=1+1=2. So UP reduces distance to (2,6).\n- (5,0) is far away, DOWN would get closer? From (1,4) to (5,0)=|1-5|+|4-0|=4+4=8. From (1,3) to (5,0)=|1-5|+|3-0|=4+3=7. So DOWN helps.\n- (8,3) and (9,7) are farther.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN are good for different apples. But note: the enemy snake is at (5,1). It might go for (5,0) apple? So (5,0) might be contested.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (1,4), moving LEFT to (0,4) might reduce options (corner). Similarly, RIGHT to (2,4) is more central.\n\nBut since I have no body, I have many options. To maximize apple collection, I should go towards multiple apples. DOWN gets me closer to (4,3) and (5,0). UP gets me closer to (2,6).\n\n(4,3) is closer than (2,6)? Distance to (4,3)=4, to (2,6)=3. So (2,6) is slightly closer. But (4,3) is in a direction with more open space? Also, enemy is at (5,1), so (4,3) is near enemy? But enemy might go for (5,0) first.\n\nActually, enemy at (5,1) can go UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0) for apple, LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1). So likely it goes DOWN to (5,0) for the apple.\n\nSo if I go DOWN, I might be competing for (4,3) and (5,0) with enemy. But I am far away.\n\nAlternatively, going UP to (1,5) gets me to (2,6) which is uncontested? Enemy is at (5,1), far away.\n\nSo UP seems safer and gets me to an apple quickly.\n\nAlso, from (1,5), I can go RIGHT to (2,5) then UP to (2,6) to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, UP is a good choice.\n\nPlan for next turns: Head towards (2,6) apple. After eating, consider going to (4,3) or (8,3). Avoid enemy snake at (5,1) which might grow after eating (5,0).\n\nSo final move: UP.\nUP",

Apples are at (9,7), (4,3), (2,6), (8,3), (3,6).\n\nPossible moves from (1,5):\n- UP: (1,6) - within bounds, no snake there (enemy is far away at (5,0)), safe.\n- DOWN: (1,4) - within bounds, no snake there, safe.\n- LEFT: (0,5) - within bounds, no snake there, safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - within bounds, no snake there, safe.\n\nAll moves are safe. Now, which is best for apples?\n\nNearby apples:\n- (2,6): Manhattan distance from (1,5) is |1-2| + |5-6| = 1+1=2. Moving UP to (1,6) gets distance to (2,6)=|1-2|+|6-6|=1+0=1. Moving RIGHT to (2,5) gets distance to (2,6)=|2-2|+|5-6|=0+1=1. So both UP and RIGHT reduce distance.\n- (3,6): from (1,5) distance= |1-3|+|5-6|=2+1=3. UP to (1,6) gives |1-3|+|6-6|=2+0=2. RIGHT to (2,5) gives |2-3|+|5-6|=1+1=2. So again both help.\n- (4,3): farther, but DOWN would help.\n\nHowever, (2,6) is very close. I should prioritize getting it quickly. Also, enemy snake is at (5,0) with body (5,1), which is far away and likely to move towards the (9,7) or (8,3) apples? Or maybe (4,3)? But (2,6) is safe from enemy.\n\nMoving UP to (1,6) is good because it gets closer to (2,6) and (3,6). From (1,6), I can go RIGHT to (2,6) to eat the apple next turn. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,5) also gets close, but then I might have to go UP to (2,6) which is the same.\n\nBut note: if I go RIGHT to (2,5), I am directly below (2,6). Then next turn I can go UP to eat it. Similarly, if I go UP to (1,6), I am left of (2,6), and next turn I can go RIGHT to eat it.\n\nBoth are equally good. However, going UP might open more options: from (1,6), I can also go UP further to (1,7) or LEFT to (0,6), etc. Going RIGHT to (2,5) might be slightly more central.\n\nBut since (2,6) is above and right, UP is direct.\n\nAlso, consider the apple at (3,6): after eating (2,6), I can go to (3,6) easily.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (2,6) next turn, then (3,6), then consider (4,3) or (8,3). Avoid enemy snake #0 which is growing and might come up.\n\nSo for this turn, UP is a good choice to approach the apple cluster.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\nUP",

I just ate the apple at (3,6) last turn, so now I have two body segments. Apples are at (9,7), (4,3), (8,3), (3,9), (3,2). Note that (3,2) is two steps down from my head.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (4,2) with body at (4,1). It has 1 apple.\n\nPossible moves from my head (3,6):\n- UP: (3,7) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- DOWN: (3,5) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- LEFT: (2,6) - but this is my body segment. Moving here would hit my own body and die.\n- RIGHT: (4,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo LEFT is immediately eliminated because it hits my own body.\n\nNow check for enemy movements: Snake #0 is at (4,2). It could move UP to (4,3) (where there is an apple), DOWN to (4,1) (its own body, so it won't do that), LEFT to (3,2) (where there is an apple), or RIGHT to (5,2). It is likely to go for an apple: either UP to (4,3) or LEFT to (3,2). Note that (3,2) is also an apple, so it might go there.\n\nIf snake #0 moves LEFT to (3,2), it will eat the apple and grow. Then its head will be at (3,2) and body at (4,2). This is not an immediate threat to me since I am at (3,6).\n\nHowever, I should consider my next moves. I want to target an apple. The closest apples are at (4,3) and (3,2). But (3,2) is being targeted by snake #0. If I go DOWN to (3,5) and then further down, I can reach (3,2) in three moves, but snake #0 might get there first. Alternatively, I can go RIGHT to (4,6) and then down to approach (4,3).\n\nAlso note the apple at (3,9) is above me, but that is farther away.\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves:\n- UP: (3,7) - safe, and opens up options to go towards (3,9) or right.\n- DOWN: (3,5) - safe, and I can then go further down to (3,4), (3,3), etc. to approach (3,2) or (4,3).\n- RIGHT: (4,6) - safe, and I can then go down to (4,5), (4,4), etc. to approach (4,3).\n\nAll three are safe. Now, which one is better for getting an apple?\n\nThe apple at (4,3) is two steps away if I go RIGHT then DOWN twice: (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3). But note that snake #0 might also be going for (4,3) by moving UP from (4,2) to (4,3). So there might be competition.\n\nThe apple at (3,2) is four steps away: e.g., DOWN to (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). But snake #0 is very close to (3,2) and might get it first.\n\nGiven that snake #0 is likely to take one of the close apples, I should consider going for the apple at (3,9) which is farther but less contested. However, that requires going up.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, I should avoid direct competition with snake #0 since it is growing. I can go UP to (3,7) to start moving towards (3,9). This is safe and gives me space. Alternatively, going RIGHT to (4,6) also gives me options to go down or right later.\n\nBut note: if I go UP, I am moving away from the cluster of apples near the bottom. However, there is an apple at (9,7) and (8,3) as well.\n\nTo avoid potential head-on collision with snake #0, I should not go directly towards the same apple. Since snake #0 is at (4,2) and likely to move left or up, I should avoid moving directly down into (3,5) which might lead me into its path.\n\nTherefore, going UP or RIGHT is better.\n\nI think UP is a good choice: it moves me towards the apple at (3,9) and also opens up the right side of the board. It is safe and has many follow-up options.\n\nRIGHT is also good: it moves me to (4,6), which is safe and I can then go down to approach (4,3) if snake #0 doesn't take it, or go right to (5,6) etc.\n\nBut since snake #0 might take (4,3), I should not rely on that. So UP is preferable.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving UP to (3,7), next turn I can go UP again to (3,8) and then (3,9) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe. Alternatively, I can go RIGHT from (3,7) to (4,7) and then down to (4,6), etc.\n\nSo I'll go UP.\n\nUP",

It could move UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2) (its own body, so it won't do that), LEFT to (3,3), or RIGHT to (5,3). Note that there are no apples directly adjacent to it, but (3,2) is an apple nearby. It might move LEFT to (3,3) to get closer to (3,2) or UP to (4,4) to explore.\n\nI should consider my goals. The closest apple is at (3,9) which is two moves UP: (3,8) then (3,9). This is very attractive. Alternatively, the apple at (9,7) is far but reachable over time.\n\nAlso, note that moving LEFT to (2,7) or RIGHT to (4,7) are safe but don't immediately get me closer to an apple as directly as UP.\n\nHowever, I must be cautious of potential head-on collisions with snake #0. Since snake #0 is at (4,3), it is not an immediate threat to me at (3,7). But if I move RIGHT to (4,7), that is safe and doesn't conflict with snake #0's likely moves.\n\nBut UP is the best move to get the apple at (3,9). After moving to (3,8), next turn I can move UP to (3,9) and eat the apple. This path is clear and safe.\n\nLEFT to (2,7) is also safe and opens up the left side of the board, but it delays getting an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (4,7) is safe and might allow me to go down later to approach other apples, but again, it delays the immediate apple.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best choice to quickly get an apple and grow.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (3,9), I will have grown to 3 segments. Then I can consider moving right towards (9,7) or down towards (8,3) while avoiding snake #0.\n\nSo I'll go UP.\n\nUP",

Apples are at (9,7), (8,3), (3,9), (3,2), (9,5). Enemy snake #0 is at head (3,3) with body [(4,3), (4,2)] and has 2 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (3,8):\n- UP: (3,9) - within bounds, has an apple! Eating this would grow me to 4 segments (since I have 2 apples collected, meaning my length is 3 currently: head + 2 body segments; after eating, I'll have 4 segments).\n- DOWN: (3,7) - this is my own body segment. Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- LEFT: (2,8) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nDOWN is immediately eliminated because it hits my own body.\n\nNow, check for enemy movements: Snake #0 is at (3,3). It could move UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2) (which has an apple! So it might go there to eat), LEFT to (2,3), or RIGHT to (4,3) (its own body, so it won't do that). Since (3,2) is an apple, it is very likely to move DOWN to eat it. Alternatively, it might move UP or LEFT to explore.\n\nMy immediate goal: The apple at (3,9) is directly above me. Moving UP to (3,9) is safe and allows me to eat it. This is highly advantageous.\n\nHowever, I must consider potential head-on collisions with snake #0. But snake #0 is at (3,3), which is far away (5 cells vertically). There is no immediate threat of collision this turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,8) or RIGHT to (4,8) are safe alternatives, but they delay eating the apple. Why wait when I can get it now?\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,9), my head will be at (3,9) and I'll have 4 segments. Then I can consider moving left or right to avoid trapping myself. Note that (3,9) is at the top edge, so after eating, I'll have to move horizontally next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating this apple, I should move away from the top edge to avoid getting trapped. Possibly move LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9) next turn. Then I can work my way down towards other apples like (8,3) or (9,7). Also, note that snake #0 might be growing by eating the apple at (3,2), so I should be cautious when moving downwards.\n\nBut for this turn, UP is clearly the best move to get the apple and grow.\n\nSo I'll go UP.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #0 has head at (3,2) with body [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)] and has collected 3 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (3,9):\n- UP: (3,10) - outside the board (y=10 is invalid, max is 9). This would kill me.\n- DOWN: (3,8) - this is my own body segment. Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nUP and DOWN are immediately eliminated because they would kill me (off-board and self-collision respectively). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe options.\n\nNow, consider enemy snake #0 at head (3,2). It could move UP to (3,3) (its own body, so it won't do that), DOWN to (3,1) (within bounds, empty), LEFT to (2,2) (within bounds, empty), or RIGHT to (4,2) (its own body, so it won't do that). So it will likely move DOWN or LEFT. Note that there is an apple at (8,1) and (8,3), but these are far from it. The closest apple to it is at (6,5) but that is still distant. So it might move randomly or towards apples.\n\nI must avoid head-on collisions. Since my head is at (3,9) and enemy head is at (3,2), there is no immediate threat of collision this turn.\n\nMy goal: I need to move towards apples safely. The apples at (9,7), (9,5), (8,3), (8,1), (6,5) are all reachable. Since I am at the top edge (y=9), I should move horizontally to get away from the edge to avoid being trapped. Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\nWhich direction gives better opportunities? Moving LEFT to (2,9) might lead me towards apples on the left side? But looking at the apples, most are on the right (x=6,8,9). Moving RIGHT to (4,9) would bring me closer to those apples. Also, note that after moving RIGHT, I can then move DOWN to (4,8) which is safe (currently empty) and then further down towards apples like (6,5) or (8,3). Moving LEFT to (2,9) might lead to less apple-rich areas.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: From (4,9), I can go DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9) (but that will be my body next turn) or RIGHT to (5,9). So DOWN and RIGHT are safe from there. From (2,9), I can go DOWN to (2,8) or LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9) (my body). So DOWN and LEFT are safe. Both have two safe options.\n\nBut since most apples are on the right, moving RIGHT seems better to position myself for future apple collection.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (4,9), next turn I should move DOWN to (4,8) to avoid the top edge and start descending towards the apples at (6,5) and (8,3). I should also monitor snake #0's movement as it might come upwards.\n\nSo for this turn, I choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are eliminated (off-board and self-collision). Only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (3,1). It can move:\n- UP: (3,2) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- DOWN: (3,0) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (2,1) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (4,1) - within bounds, empty (no body there).\n\nSo enemy will likely move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. There is an apple at (8,1) which is far, but it might move towards apples. Note that (4,1) is safe for it, and if it moves RIGHT to (4,1), it would be adjacent to my path if I go DOWN to (4,8) but not an immediate threat.\n\nMy goal: Move towards apples safely. The apples at (9,7), (9,5), (8,3), (8,1), (6,5) are all on the right side (high x). Moving RIGHT to (5,9) brings me closer to these apples. Moving DOWN to (4,8) is safe but doesn't progress much towards apples.\n\nFrom (5,9), next turn I can go DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9) (both should be safe) to continue towards apples like (6,5) or (9,5). From (4,8), I can go DOWN to (4,7) or RIGHT to (5,8) (both safe) but that is slower to reach apples.\n\nAlso, staying at the top edge (y=9) is risky because I have fewer moves (UP is always blocked). So moving DOWN is good to get away from the edge. However, RIGHT also allows me to move DOWN next turn.\n\nBut note: if I move RIGHT to (5,9), I am still at the top edge. Next turn from (5,9), I cannot go UP (off-board), and LEFT would be (4,9) which might be my body if I grow? But currently, after moving RIGHT, my body will be [(4,9), (3,9), (3,8)] so (4,9) is my body next turn. So from (5,9), safe moves would be DOWN to (5,8) and RIGHT to (6,9). So two safe options.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4,8), from there I can go DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,8) (but that is my body? After moving DOWN, my body becomes [(4,9), (3,9), (3,8)] so (3,8) is my body. So LEFT to (3,8) is unsafe. So from (4,8), safe moves are DOWN to (4,7) and RIGHT to (5,8). Also two safe options.\n\nSo both moves give similar future flexibility. But RIGHT gets me closer to apples faster.\n\nAlso, consider enemy: if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,1), it is far away and not an immediate threat. Even if it moves UP? But it can't because (3,2) is its body. So no direct conflict.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT to make progress towards the apples on the right.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (5,9), next turn move DOWN to (5,8) to avoid the top edge and start descending towards apples like (6,5) and (8,3).

Apples are at (9,7), (8,3), (9,5), (8,1), (6,5). Enemy snake #0 has head at (4,1) with body [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] and has collected 3 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (5,9):\n- UP: (5,10) - outside the board (y=10 invalid). This would kill me.\n- DOWN: (5,8) - within bounds, currently empty (no snake body).\n- LEFT: (4,9) - this is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are eliminated (off-board and self-collision). Only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (4,1). It can move:\n- UP: (4,2) - within bounds, empty.\n- DOWN: (4,0) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (3,1) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- RIGHT: (5,1) - within bounds, empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. There is an apple at (8,1) which is far, but also one at (8,3) and (6,5). It might move towards these. Note that (5,1) is safe for it, and if it moves RIGHT to (5,1), it is still far from me.\n\nMy goal: Move towards apples safely. The apples at (6,5), (8,3), (9,5), (9,7) are all reachable. Moving DOWN to (5,8) brings me closer to (6,5) and also away from the top edge (which is risky). Moving RIGHT to (6,9) also progresses towards apples but keeps me at the top edge.\n\nFrom (5,8), next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8) (but after moving DOWN, my body will be [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8)] so (4,8) is free? Actually, my body segments are (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8). So (4,8) is not occupied. So safe moves from (5,8) would be DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8), RIGHT to (6,8). Three options.\n\nFrom (6,9), safe moves would be DOWN to (6,8) and RIGHT to (7,9) (since UP is off-board and LEFT is (5,9) which is my body next turn). So only two safe options.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN gives more future flexibility and avoids the top edge. Also, (6,5) is closer and easier to reach from (5,8) than from (6,9).\n\nAlso, enemy is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN to progress towards the apple at (6,5) and to get away from the top edge.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (5,8), next turn consider moving DOWN to (5,7) or RIGHT to (6,8) to approach (6,5). Monitor snake #0's movement as it might move upwards over time.\n\nDOWN",

Apples are at (9,7), (8,3), (9,5), (8,1), (6,5). Enemy snake #0 has head at (6,2) with body [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] and has collected 3 apples.\n\nPossible moves from my head (5,6):\n- UP: (5,7) - this is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- DOWN: (5,5) - within bounds, currently empty (no snake body).\n- LEFT: (4,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (6,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo UP is eliminated (self-collision). DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (6,2). It can move:\n- UP: (6,3) - within bounds, empty.\n- DOWN: (6,1) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- LEFT: (5,2) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - within bounds, empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. There is an apple at (8,3) which is up and right, so it might move UP or RIGHT. But enemy is far from me (at y=2 vs my y=6) and not an immediate threat.\n\nMy goal: Move towards apples safely. The closest apple is at (6,5). From (5,6), moving DOWN to (5,5) gets me closer to (6,5) (since I can then go RIGHT to (6,5) directly). Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also progresses towards (6,5) but requires going DOWN next. Moving LEFT to (4,6) moves me away from the apples.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- From (5,5): I can go DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), or RIGHT to (6,5) (which is the apple!). So moving DOWN now sets up a direct path to the apple next turn via RIGHT.\n- From (6,6): I can go DOWN to (6,5) (apple), LEFT to (5,6) (which will be empty next turn), or RIGHT to (7,6). All safe.\n- From (4,6): I can go DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6), or UP to (4,7) (which is empty). But this takes me further from the apples.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (5,5) is efficient because it allows me to potentially eat the apple at (6,5) next turn by moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (6,6) also allows eating the apple next turn by moving DOWN, but that is equally good. However, moving DOWN avoids the top edge where my body is concentrated and gives more options.\n\nI should also consider the enemy: snake #0 might move towards the apple at (8,3) or (8,1), but it is far. The apple at (6,5) is uncontested for now.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving DOWN to (5,5), next turn move RIGHT to (6,5) to eat the apple. Then consider moving to other apples like (9,5) or (9,7). Avoid moving into corners. Monitor snake #0's movement as it might move upwards over time.\n\nDOWN",

Eating it would grow me to 5 segments.\n\nSo UP is eliminated (self-collision). DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (6,3). It can move:\n- UP: (6,4) - within bounds, empty.\n- DOWN: (6,2) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- LEFT: (5,3) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - within bounds, empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. There is an apple at (8,3) which is to the right, so it might move RIGHT. But enemy is at y=3 and I am at y=5, so not an immediate threat.\n\nMy goal: Eat the apple at (6,5) by moving RIGHT. This is safe and efficient. It grows me and gives me a point.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my head will be at (6,5) and I will have a new tail (since I grow). My body will be [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8)]? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a segment at the tail. So after moving RIGHT to (6,5) and eating, the head becomes (6,5), and the tail remains the same (so the body becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] with the tail at (5,8)? Wait, no: the snake grows by not moving the tail for one turn. So the body list will have the new head and the old body without removing the tail. So my length becomes 5.\n\nThis move is optimal because it directly gets an apple and avoids danger.\n\nOther moves: DOWN to (5,4) or LEFT to (4,5) are safe but do not get an apple immediately. They might be useful if RIGHT were dangerous, but it is not.\n\nCheck for head-on collision: Enemy might move to (6,4) or (5,3) or (7,3). None of these is (6,5). So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,5) is the best move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (6,5), consider moving towards other apples like (9,5) or (9,7). Avoid moving into corners. Monitor snake #0's movement as it might move upwards. Also, note that my body is concentrated along the left column (x=5), so moving rightwards gives more space.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving here would cause a head-on collision (both heads to same cell) and both die. This is fatal.\n- LEFT: (5,5) - my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- RIGHT: (7,5) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are safe. DOWN and LEFT are eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (6,4). It can move:\n- UP: (6,5) - my head position. If it moves here and I don't move away, head-on collision? But I am moving away. Actually, if enemy moves UP to (6,5) and I move to (7,5) or (6,6), no collision. But if enemy moves UP and I stay, collision. But I am moving.\n- DOWN: (6,3) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- LEFT: (5,4) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,4) - within bounds, empty.\n\nEnemy might move UP to (6,5) to try to eat the apple? But the apple at (6,5) was eaten last turn (by me). So no apple there now. Enemy might move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid obstacles or towards other apples.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (6,6)) and RIGHT (to (7,5)).\n\nUP: Moves towards the top, where there are apples at (9,7) and (9,5). Also, my body is mostly above me (at y=6,7,8), so moving UP might bring me closer to my own body, but (6,6) is safe. However, after moving UP, my head will be at (6,6) and my body will be [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)] and tail at (5,8)? Actually, since I grew last turn, my tail is still at (5,8). So moving UP will shift the body.\n\nRIGHT: Moves towards the right side, where there are apples at (9,5) and (9,7). Also, moving RIGHT opens more space and avoids the enemy.\n\nWhich move is safer? Consider enemy's possible moves:\n- If enemy moves UP to (6,5), and I move UP to (6,6), no collision.\n- If enemy moves LEFT to (5,4) or RIGHT to (7,4), no direct threat to me.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT seem safe.\n\nNow, which move is better for apples? The closest apples are (9,5) and (9,7). Moving RIGHT (to (7,5)) is directly towards (9,5). Moving UP (to (6,6)) is also towards (9,7) but slightly less direct.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT might be better to avoid being trapped near the left wall (my body is at x=5). Moving right gives more options.\n\nLong-term plan: After this move, aim for the apples at (9,5) and (9,7). Avoid the enemy snake #0 which is below me. Also, note the apple at (8,3) is near the enemy, so it might go for that. I should stay away from the bottom area for now.\n\nI choose RIGHT to (7,5) as it is efficient for reaching (9,5) and opens more space.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 3.\n\nPossible moves from my head (7,5):\n- UP: (7,6) - within bounds, currently empty (no snake body).\n- DOWN: (7,4) - occupied by enemy snake #0's head. Moving here would cause a head-on collision (both heads to same cell) and both die. This is fatal.\n- LEFT: (6,5) - my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- RIGHT: (8,5) - within bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are safe. DOWN and LEFT are eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (7,4). It can move:\n- UP: (7,5) - my head position. If it moves here and I don't move away, head-on collision. But I am moving away (to UP or RIGHT).\n- DOWN: (7,3) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (6,4) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- RIGHT: (8,4) - within bounds, empty.\n\nEnemy might move UP to (7,5) to try to attack me? But that would cause a head-on collision if I stay, but I won't. Alternatively, it might move DOWN or RIGHT to avoid me or go for apples.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (7,6)) and RIGHT (to (8,5)).\n\nUP: Moves towards the top, where there are apples at (9,7) and (9,5). Also, my body is below me (at y=5 and lower), so moving UP avoids my body and opens space.\nRIGHT: Moves towards the right side, closer to apples at (9,5) and (9,7). Also, moving right might be efficient.\n\nWhich move is safer? Consider enemy's possible moves:\n- If enemy moves UP to (7,5), and I move UP to (7,6), no collision.\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,4), and I move RIGHT to (8,5), we are adjacent but no collision.\nBoth are safe.\n\nNow, which move is better for apples? The closest apples are (9,5) and (9,7). Moving RIGHT (to (8,5)) is directly towards (9,5). Moving UP (to (7,6)) is also towards (9,7) but slightly less direct.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT might be better to avoid the enemy below. The enemy is at (7,4) and might move up, so moving UP could bring me closer to potential conflict if enemy moves up. Moving right creates more distance.\n\nLong-term plan: Aim for the apples at (9,5) and (9,7). Avoid the enemy snake #0 which is below. After this move, consider going right again or up to reach (9,5) quickly. The apple at (8,3) is near the enemy, so let it have that. I should focus on the top-right apples.\n\nI choose RIGHT to (8,5) as it is efficient for reaching (9,5) and creates distance from the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

It can move:\n- UP: (8,4) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- DOWN: (8,2) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (7,3) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - within bounds, empty.\n\nThe enemy might move DOWN to (8,2) or LEFT to (7,3) or RIGHT to (9,3). There is no apple directly adjacent to it, so it might move randomly.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (9,6)) and DOWN (to (9,4)).\n\nUP leads towards the apple at (9,7). If I go UP, I can go to (9,6) and then next turn to (9,7) to eat it.\nDOWN leads to (9,4), which is safe but away from the apple.\n\nWhich move is safer? Both are safe. However, going DOWN might be riskier because the enemy is at (8,3) and could move RIGHT to (9,3), which is adjacent to (9,4). If I go DOWN to (9,4) and the enemy goes RIGHT to (9,3), we are adjacent. Next turn, if I go DOWN to (9,3) and the enemy goes UP to (9,4), we collide head-on. So DOWN might lead to a potential conflict zone.\n\nGoing UP to (9,6) is safer because the enemy is far below. Also, it gets me closer to the apple at (9,7).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (9,6), next turn I can go UP to (9,7) to eat that apple. Then I can consider going LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) (but that would be my body). Alternatively, after eating (9,7), I might go LEFT to (8,7) to explore the top row. The enemy is at the bottom and might go for (8,1) or (1,0) or (0,0). I should dominate the top-right area.\n\nI choose UP to (9,6) to approach the apple at (9,7).\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 4.\n\nPossible moves from my head (9,6):\n- UP: (9,7) - within bounds, contains an apple.

Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- LEFT: (8,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: not possible, since x=9 is the right edge.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are safe.

It might go there to eat it.\n- LEFT: (7,2) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,2) - within bounds, empty.\n\nThe enemy is likely to go DOWN to (8,1) to eat the apple, since that gives it growth and points. Alternatively, it might go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (9,7)) and LEFT (to (8,6)).\n\nUP leads directly to the apple at (9,7). Eating it would give me 6 apples and grow to length 7. This is highly beneficial.\nLEFT leads to (8,6), which is safe but doesn't immediately get an apple.\n\nWhich move is safer? Both are safe. However, going UP to (9,7) is safe because no other snake is adjacent to (9,7). The enemy is at (8,2) and cannot reach (9,7) in one move. Even if it goes RIGHT to (9,2), it is far away.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (9,7), my head will be at (9,7) and my body will extend. The next turn, I can consider moving LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) (but (9,6) will be occupied by my body at that point). So LEFT to (8,7) would be the only safe option next turn? Actually, after eating, my body grows, so the tail doesn't move. So the segment at (5,5) remains, and the new tail is at (6,5). So next turn, if I am at (9,7), the body behind me is [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)]. Then possible moves from (9,7):\n- UP: not possible (y=7 is top, so (9,8) is out of bounds).\n- DOWN: (9,6) - my body (so not safe).\n- LEFT: (8,7) - empty.\n- RIGHT: not possible.\n\nSo only LEFT is safe next turn. That is acceptable.\n\nGoing LEFT to (8,6) now avoids the apple but gives me more options next turn? From (8,6), I can go UP to (8,7) (which is empty) or DOWN to (8,5) (which is my body) or LEFT to (7,6) (empty) or RIGHT to (9,6) (my body). So UP and LEFT would be safe. This might be better for future flexibility, but I miss the immediate apple.\n\nHowever, the apple at (9,7) is very close and valuable. I should take it. Also, if I don't take it, the enemy might eventually come up? But the enemy is currently at (8,2) and has apples below to eat.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (9,7), I will be forced to go LEFT to (8,7) next turn. Then from (8,7), I can go DOWN to (8,6) (which might be safe if my body has moved) or LEFT to (7,7) to explore the top row. There is an apple at (4,7) on the top row. So I can plan to move left along y=7 to get that apple. Meanwhile, the enemy is likely to eat the apple at (8,1) and then maybe (1,0) or (0,0). I should dominate the top row.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP to (9,7) to eat the apple.\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 6.\nApples present: (1,0), (4,7), (0,0), (3,9), (2,4)\nEnemy snake #0 has head at (8,1) and body: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4)] (length 5). Apples collected: 5.\n\nPossible moves from my head (9,7):\n- UP: (9,8) - out of bounds (y=8 is beyond top y=9? Wait: coordinates range from (0,0) to (9,9), so y=9 is top. Therefore (9,8) is within bounds? Actually, y=8 is valid since max y is 9. So (9,8) is within bounds. Currently empty.\n- DOWN: (9,6) - within bounds, but this is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- LEFT: (8,7) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: not possible, since x=9 is the right edge.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are safe. DOWN is eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (8,1). It can move:\n- UP: (8,2) - its own body (so it won't do that).\n- DOWN: (8,0) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (7,1) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,1) - within bounds, empty.\n\nThe enemy has multiple safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. It might go DOWN to (8,0) to approach the apples at (1,0) and (0,0), or LEFT/RIGHT to explore.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (9,8)) and LEFT (to (8,7)).\n\nUP leads to (9,8), which is safe but no apple there. However, it is closer to the apple at (3,9) and (4,7) along the top row.\nLEFT leads to (8,7), which is safe and also moves me towards the apples at (4,7) and (3,9).\n\nWhich move is better? Both are safe. However, going UP to (9,8) might be riskier because it is the top edge and I have fewer options next turn. From (9,8), next turn I can only go LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (9,7) (but (9,7) will be occupied by my body if I move up). Actually, if I move UP to (9,8), my head moves and the body follows. So next turn, my body will be: head at (9,8), then (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5). Then from (9,8), possible moves:\n- UP: (9,9) - within bounds, empty.\n- DOWN: (9,7) - my body (not safe).\n- LEFT: (8,8) - empty.\n- RIGHT: not possible.\n\nSo UP and LEFT would be safe next turn from (9,8). That is acceptable.\n\nGoing LEFT to (8,7) gives more options: from (8,7), I can go UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6) (which is empty now), LEFT to (7,7), or RIGHT to (9,7) (my body). So UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe. This is more flexible.\n\nLong-term plan: I want to collect the apples at (4,7) and (3,9). Moving LEFT to (8,7) sets me on a path to move left along y=7 towards (4,7). Alternatively, moving UP to (9,8) then LEFT to (8,8) and then to (7,8), etc., to reach (3,9) is also possible.\n\nBut note: the apple at (4,7) is at y=7, so moving along y=7 is direct. Also, the enemy is at (8,1) and is likely to move downwards or sideways, so it is not a threat to the top row immediately.\n\nI should prefer LEFT to (8,7) because it gives more immediate options and starts me on the path to (4,7). Also, if I go UP to (9,8), I am very close to the top edge and might get trapped later.\n\nTherefore, I choose LEFT to (8,7).\n\nLEFT",

Apples collected: 5.\n\nPossible moves from my head (8,7):\n- UP: (8,8) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- DOWN: (8,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- LEFT: (7,7) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (9,7) - within bounds, but this is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe. RIGHT is eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #0 at head (7,1). It can move:\n- UP: (7,2) - within bounds, empty.\n- DOWN: (7,0) - within bounds, empty.\n- LEFT: (6,1) - within bounds, empty.\n- RIGHT: (8,1) - within bounds, but this is its own body segment (so it won't do that).\n\nSo the enemy has safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. It might go DOWN to (7,0) to approach the apples at (1,0) and (0,0), or LEFT/UP to explore.\n\nMy goal: Choose between UP (to (8,8)), DOWN (to (8,6)), and LEFT (to (7,7)).\n\nLong-term plan: I want to collect the apples at (4,7) and (3,9). Moving LEFT to (7,7) directly advances me toward (4,7) along y=7. Moving UP to (8,8) gets me closer to (3,9) via the top row. Moving DOWN to (8,6) moves me away from both apples and might not be optimal.\n\nFrom (7,7), I would have multiple options next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT would be back to (8,7), which might be occupied by my body). This is flexible.\nFrom (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) or LEFT to (7,8) (RIGHT is off board). Still good.\nFrom (8,6), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? RIGHT to (9,6) is my body? Actually, my body has (9,6) and (9,5), etc. So (9,6) is occupied. So from (8,6), safe moves would be UP to (8,7) (but (8,7) will be my body next turn), DOWN to (8,5) (my body), LEFT to (7,6). So only LEFT is safe? That is very restrictive. Therefore, DOWN to (8,6) is risky because it limits my next moves significantly.\n\nSo DOWN should be avoided due to poor future options.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT:\n- LEFT to (7,7) is directly toward the apple at (4,7) (only 3 steps away horizontally) and also keeps me in a central position with good options.\n- UP to (8,8) is toward the apple at (3,9) but requires more vertical movement.\n\nAlso, the enemy is far away at y=1, so no immediate threat.\n\nI should prefer LEFT to (7,7) as it efficiently targets the closest apple (4,7) and maintains flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here would hit myself and die.\n- DOWN: (2,6) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- LEFT: (1,7) - within bounds, currently empty.\n- RIGHT: (3,7) - within bounds, but this is my own body segment (the fifth segment). Moving here would hit myself and die.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe moves. UP and RIGHT are eliminated.\n\nNow evaluating DOWN and LEFT:\n- DOWN: (2,6) - safe, moves me directly toward apples at (2,4) and (1,6). This continues my descent toward the cluster of apples.\n- LEFT: (1,7) - safe, moves me toward the apple at (1,6) and potentially (0,3), but also brings me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (0,2) and could potentially move UP to (0,3) (where there's an apple), RIGHT to (1,2), or DOWN to (0,1) (which is its own body, so invalid). It will likely move toward the apple at (0,3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,7) puts me closer to the enemy's potential path and could lead to a confrontation. Moving DOWN to (2,6) maintains a safer distance while still progressing toward the apples.\n\nDOWN also gives me good future options: LEFT to (1,6) to get the apple, RIGHT to (3,6), or continuing DOWN to (2,5). LEFT to (1,7) gives me options DOWN to (1,6) or LEFT to (0,7), but RIGHT to (2,7) would be my own body.\n\nGiven that the apples at (2,4) and (1,6) are my primary targets, DOWN is the most direct and safest path.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nContinue descending toward apples at (2,4) and (1,6). From (2,6), consider moving LEFT to (1,6) to collect the apple if safe. Monitor enemy movement - it may be heading for (0,3). Avoid getting too close to enemy snake; prefer downward movements toward (2,4) if enemy approaches left side.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",
