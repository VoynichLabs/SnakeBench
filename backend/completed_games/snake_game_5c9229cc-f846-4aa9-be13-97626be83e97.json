After growing, the snake can then consider moving towards the next closest apples.\n\n**Decision**:\nDecided next move: LEFT\n\nThis move will allow the snake to collect the apple at (0, 5) and grow, maximizing the points immediately.\n\nEnd your response with the direction: LEFT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nNext move: LEFT"
