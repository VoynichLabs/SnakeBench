Opponent head at (3,7). Your body sits at [(9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (8,8)]. Apple drops are coming fast, but we\u2019re focused on the enemy and the flow of the board.\n- SAFE MOVES FROM (9,7):\n  - UP -> (9,8) is a direct hit into your own neck. DEAD.\n  - RIGHT -> (10,7) is off-board. DEAD.\n  - DOWN -> (9,6) SAFE. Opens a direct march toward the big apple at (9,4).\n  - LEFT -> (8,7) SAFE. Keeps you on the edge but diverts away from the immediate apple line.\n- DECISION: We want apples to close the score gap, and we want a clean path that doesn\u2019t trap us. DOWN is the aggressive choice that lines us up for the (9,4) apple in the near term. It also keeps us hugging the right edge, which is a nice corridor to pressure if the opponent slips into our path later. LEFT is safer in the moment but slows us toward the key apple distribution we want now.\n- RISK ASSESSMENT: Opponent is far left (x ~ 3). There\u2019s no imminent head-on risk this turn. Moving DOWN keeps us moving toward more apples, which is how we close the 4-5 gap. The edge play means fewer chances to trap ourselves in tight corners on this turn.\n- LONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns): \n  - If we hit (9,4) and eat, we jump to 5 apples; we\u2019ll look to chain downward to (9,3) to grab (9,3) apple on the next safe turn if the board allows. \n  - If the opponent somehow skirts into our right flank later, we\u2019ll pivot to LEFT to weave away and avoid a head-on collision while still stacking apples.\n  - Maintain edge leverage; avoid looping into our own tail and avoid any line that would force a trap with limited escape routes.\n\nBRIEF PLAN NOTES\n- We\u2019re prioritizing: (a) staying alive, (b) increasing apple count quickly, (c) preserving future options on the right edge to keep the pressure on the board without giving the opponent an easy run at us.\n\nFINAL MOVE PLAN (answering live, right now)\n- Take DOWN to (9,6) to chase the apple line toward (9,4) and keep the edge corridor open for future pressure.\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019ve got three safe options: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), or LEFT to (7,5). Right is off-limits (would hit our own neck into (9,5)).\n\nWhy DOWN beats the others this turn:\n- UP (8,6) keeps us safe but stalls our pursuit; it doesn\u2019t threaten any apples this turn and drifts us away from the immediate apple on the right.\n- LEFT (7,5) inches us toward center and could invite tighter chasing lines, but also risks giving the opponent room to exploit our created corridor.\n- DOWN (8,4) lines us up to grab the nearby apple on the right edge (9,4) next turn. This is a clean, safe gain if our path stays clear, and it keeps a straightforward plan to stay alive while closing a gap in score.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (8,4) this turn. It keeps us safe, sets up a direct next-step to eat the apple at (9,4).\n- On turn after that, move RIGHT to eat (9,4) if it\u2019s still available. That\u2019ll increase our apples to 5 and continue pressure without risking a head-on with the rival.\n- Maintain the right-edge corridor discipline to limit the opponent\u2019s space, while staying ready to pivot into a boxed, center-tight strategy if the opportunity to trap presents itself.\n- Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s position (they\u2019re far left at (2,5)); our primary risk is self-collision or a late head-on, so avoid reckless trades until we have a clearer edge.\n\nLonger-term strategy note:\n- Use the edge as a wall to systematically shrink the arena available to the rival while we slowly climb toward parity on apples. If we ever gain the lead, pivot to more aggressive head-on pressure. If not, keep collecting apples to close the gap and preserve safe escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

With 11 vs 14 apples, we stay aggressive but avoid reckless trades that give them a clean advantage.\n\nTurn-by-turn awareness:\n- Watch for Snake #1\u2019s choices at (6,9) after our move.

WE GOTTA CLOSE THE GAP BUT NOT GET BOTTLED IN. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n- From (6,6) we\u2019ve got four directions:\n  - UP \u2192 (6,7) is already part of our body (second segment). DEAD.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,5) safe right now.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,6) safe right now.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) is also part of our body (third segment). DEAD.\n- SAFE MOVES: DOWN or LEFT. Both keep us alive and push toward apples while keeping options open.\n- Short-term apple proximity:\n  - Down (6,5) feeds us closer to apples on the same column (6,1) and (6,0).\n  - Left (5,6) nudges toward the (3,6) apple line, opening a leftward corridor but maybe inviting tighter space around us if he encroaches.\n- Score context: We\u2019re trailing (11 vs. 15). We should avoid a risky head-on since we\u2019re not in a position to safely win that exchange this turn.\n- Plan to box and pressure: Maintain central presence, elongate safely, and threaten the mid-right apples without sacrificing safety.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE: DOWN\n\nShort-term plan (next 2-4 moves):\n- Move to (6,5) now.\n- From there, aim for a safe, multi-turn path toward (6,1)/(6,0) apples if the line stays clear.\n- Keep a thin buffer around Snake #1\u2019s top-right region; don\u2019t cage yourself in the top-left corridor unless you have a clean escape.\n- If Snake #1 pivots toward the top-right apple cluster, adjust to stay in the center and avoid a forced head-on.\n\nLong-term strategy note:\n- Use the extra length to influence the board\u2019s center, keeping lines open to pivot away from potential traps. If an opportunity to trap him arises near the mid-right apples without risking a fatal head-on, take it; otherwise stay patient and grow to outlast him, forcing mistakes around the apple-heavy zones.\n\nTurn-by-turn awareness:\n- Watch Snake #1\u2019s choice near the top row. If they commit to a path that would funnel toward our column or toward a head-on risk, we\u2019ll adapt by keeping our shape compact and using our length to block escape routes rather than chase. Stay vigilant for any sudden cuts toward (6,9) or (7,9) that could indicate an attempt to box us.\n\ndown",

If they chase and we get a clean pass behind them, we\u2019ll threaten a box-in pattern without diving into a risky head-on.\n\nGAME PLAN NOTE:\n- Keep at least two safe move options open for the next turn.\n- If Snake #1 tries to pin us, pivot to the left to maintain exit routes and avoid a trap.\n\nDOWN",

Time to push for bottom growth and keep the space tight on the enemy so we can flip the score.\n\nDECISION PROCESS (THINK BEFORE YOU MOVE):\n- Current head: (6,3). Safe options: DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3). UP is a death trap into our own neck at (6,4).\n- Apples near the bottom: (6,1) and (6,0) are two steps away if we commit downward. Grabbing them swings the score quicker.\n- Opponent is up top. No immediate risk of a head-on this turn if we head downward; they\u2019re not closing on our vertical lane.\n\nSAFE MOVES AND PLAN:\n- DOWN to (6,2): keeps a clean vertical path toward the bottom apples. Maintains multiple follow-ups (down to (6,1) for the apple, or left to (5,2) if needed). Reduces risk of getting boxed in by the enemy\u2019s top-right spread.\n- LEFT to (5,3): shifts us toward left-side apples but introduces a longer route to the bottom cluster; still safe.\n- RIGHT to (7,3): opens space to swing around the bottom-right region but doesn\u2019t cue an immediate apple grab this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM STRATEGY:\n- Take the direct route to the bottom apples (6,2) then (6,1) to swing the apple gap.\n- Keep at least two safe follow-ups after this move to avoid a trap if Snake #1 shifts.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:\n- If we equalize on apples, we can threaten a lateral press along their right flank by pivoting into the lower rows, steering their tail into a trap. Stay aggressive, but don\u2019t box yourself into a dead-end\u2014always preserve escape lines (prefer staying near the central/left corridor with room to retreat).\n- Priority is safe growth first, then pressure on their tail with controlled, lines-of-sight plays rather than reckless head-ons.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE FOR TURN 35: DOWN\nDOWN",
