Both of us have 1 apple, so we're tied in the scoreboard!\n\nLet me scan the safe moves from our position at (9,9):\n- UP to (9,10): DEAD. Off the board. No bueno.\n- DOWN to (9,8): DEAD. That's our own body segment. Don't hit yourself!\n- LEFT to (8,9): Safe! No body there, on board.\n- RIGHT to (10,9): DEAD. Off the board. RIP.\n\nSo we've got ONE safe move: LEFT to (8,9).\n\nNow let's think about the board state. We're at the top-right corner at (9,9). The apples are scattered all over, but we need to think positioning first.\n\nKey observations:\n- Enemy is at (8,6), so no immediate collision threat\n- We have a body segment at (9,8) - we can't go back down\n- The board is wide open, so we should focus on controlling territory\n- We're in a corner, which is dangerous - we need to get out ASAP\n\nLooking at our options:\n- LEFT is our only safe move, taking us to (8,9)\n- This opens up movement options: we can then go UP, DOWN, or keep going LEFT\n- We need to avoid getting trapped in the corner\n\nI'm feeling LEFT. It's literally our only safe option, and it gets us out of the corner where we could get trapped!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nYo chat, we're going LEFT to (8,9) to escape the corner and open up our options. From there we can pivot in any direction. Keep an eye on that enemy - they might try to cut us off if we go too far left! Let's focus on controlling the center of the board and keeping our options open. The apples will come naturally as we dominate the territory!\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

We've got 1 apple, they've got 2. They're AHEAD!\n\nChecking our safe moves from (6,9):\n- UP to (6,10): DEAD. Off the board. No way!\n- DOWN to (6,8): Safe! Empty space, on board.\n- LEFT to (5,9): Safe! Empty space, on board.\n- RIGHT to (7,9): DEAD. That's our OWN body segment. Don't hit yourself!\n\nSo we've got TWO safe moves: DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9).\n\nLet me think about the board state:\n- Enemy is at (6,7), so if we go DOWN to (6,8), we're putting ourselves RIGHT NEXT to their head! Dangerous positioning!\n- If we go LEFT to (5,9), we're moving away from them and opening up the board\n- We're at the top edge, so we need to be careful about getting trapped against the wall\n- The apples are scattered, but positioning is MORE IMPORTANT right now\n\nLooking at our options:\n- DOWN to (6,8): Gets us closer to the enemy - risky! They could move UP into us\n- LEFT to (5,9): Moves us away from danger, opens up more movement options\n\nI'm feeling LEFT. We need to avoid that head-on collision risk with the enemy. Let's keep our distance and control the board!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nYo chat, we're going LEFT to (5,9) to avoid that dangerous positioning next to the enemy's head. From there we can pivot UP or DOWN to control the center. Keep that enemy boxed out and watch for opportunities to cut them off! The apples will come as we dominate the territory.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",
