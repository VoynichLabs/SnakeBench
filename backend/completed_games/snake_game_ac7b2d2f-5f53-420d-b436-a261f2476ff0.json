Here, (4, 1) is currently my tail, and it contains no apple. If I move here, I hit my own body.\n    *   *Fatal.*\n\nTherefore, UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Strategic Selection:**\n\nThe apple at (1, 1) is the closest. Moving LEFT (3, 1) -> (2, 1) brings me one step closer to it.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (2, 1), the next turn I can move LEFT again to (1, 1) and collect the apple.\n*   Moving UP to (3, 2) moves diagonally away from (1, 1) (distance increases to 3).\n*   Moving DOWN to (3, 0) moves diagonally away from (1, 1) (distance remains 2, but it's a less direct path).\n\nMoving LEFT is the shortest path to the closest apple (1, 1).\n\n**Enemy Consideration (Snake 0 at (4, 7)):**\nSnake 0 is far away and currently positioned defensively/centrally on the top half. No immediate competition for (1, 1) is expected.\n\nI choose LEFT to approach apple (1, 1).\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1. Move LEFT to (2, 1).\n2. Move LEFT to (1, 1) to eat the apple.\n3. Assess the board. If Snake 0 is still far away, target (8, 0) or (6, 3). (6, 3) is a coordinate that potentially draws Snake 0 down the center, which might increase collision risk later, so (8, 0) near the bottom right corner might be safer after the current apple.\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT is lethal.\n\n**Strategic Selection:**\nWe need to move towards (4, 1). The best directions are UP or DOWN, followed by RIGHT moves. Moving LEFT takes us further into the corner, which increases the path distance to (4, 1).\n\n*   If I move **UP to (1, 2)**: Next turn options would include RIGHT (to 2, 2) continuing towards (4, 1), or DOWN (to 1, 1, safe since the tail moves), or LEFT. This seems like a strong choice, opening up the board and preparing for the next two RIGHT moves.\n*   If I move **DOWN to (1, 0)**: Next turn I must move RIGHT (to 2, 0) to stay on track for (4, 1). This is also good.\n\nComparing UP vs DOWN: (4, 1) is clearly reachable from either path. Moving DOWN keeps me closer to the x=1 line, while moving UP gives slight vertical leeway. Since (4, 1) is on the y=1 line, moving DOWN to (1, 0) seems slightly more direct in terms of minimizing vertical deviation, though both are excellent path starters.\n\nLet's check the state of the tail. If I move DOWN to (1, 0), my body becomes [(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)]. The cell (3, 1) is now free.\nIf I move UP to (1, 2), my body becomes [(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]. The cell (3, 1) is now free.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are equally good for reaching (4, 1) in 4 moves (D, R, R, R or U, R, R, R).\n\nLet's pick **UP** to give myself slightly more breathing room in the bottom corner of the board, as the enemy snake is high up and unlikely to interfere with this low apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):**\nNext turn (T4): Move RIGHT to (2, 2) to continue progress towards (4, 1).\nTurn T5: Move RIGHT to (3, 2).\nTurn T6: Move DOWN or RIGHT to capture (4, 1).\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nUP",

This is a very real threat.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves based on targeting (6, 3):**\nTarget A1: (6, 3). Distance 4.\n\n*   **Move UP (to (4, 2))**: New D to (6, 3) is 2 + 1 = 3. Excellent progress towards A1. It also puts us close to A4: (0, 2) (D=4) and A3: (9, 2) (D=5).\n*   **Move RIGHT (to (5, 1))**: New D to (6, 3) is 1 + 2 = 3. Excellent progress towards A1.\n*   **Move DOWN (to (4, 0))**: New D to (6, 3) is 2 + 3 = 5. Moves away from (6, 3) but closer to (8, 0) (D=4).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce the distance to (6, 3) to 3.\n\nLet's evaluate the subsequent moves.\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 2)**:\nNext turn (T9) from (4, 2), we can move RIGHT to (5, 2), then further right/up. This path is less vulnerable to the Enemy #0's aggressive move towards (6, 3).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (5, 1)**:\nNext turn (T9) from (5, 1), possible moves towards (6, 3) are UP to (5, 2) or RIGHT to (6, 1). If we go UP (5, 2), the space is slightly more confined near the bottom of the board.\n\n**Addressing Enemy Threat to (6, 3):**\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (6, 3) this turn, it captures A1. There is nothing we can do this turn to stop this. We must assume it might capture it and pivot if necessary.\n\nIf Snake #0 captures A1, our closest remaining apples are A2 (8, 0) and A4 (0, 2), both D=5 from (4, 1).\nIf A1 is captured, (3, 1) is a 4/5 split.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples if A1 is taken:\n(8, 0) - D=5\n(0, 2) - D=5\n(9, 2) - D=6\n(4, 9) - D=8\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 2):\nNew position (4, 2).\nD to (8, 0) = 4 + 2 = 6\nD to (0, 2) = 4 + 0 = 4 (New closest!)\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 1):\nNew position (5, 1).\nD to (8, 0) = 3 + 1 = 4 (New closest!)\nD to (0, 2) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nMoving UP seems strategically better as it opens up the option to move West towards (0, 2) if A1 is captured, or continue North-East towards (6, 3) if A1 is missed by the enemy. (4, 2) is a good central spot in the mid-line of the board.\n\nSince our immediate priority is to gain distance towards the next available apple, and since (6, 3) is the closest, both UP and RIGHT are good. UP leads to (4, 2), which is centrally located and provides excellent flexibility.\n\n**Action:** Move UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 9):**\nHead will be at (4, 2).\nRecalculate target based on results of Turn 8:\n1. Check if (6, 3) was eaten (most likely by Snake #0 if it moves DOWN).\n2. If (6, 3) remains, aim for RIGHT (5, 2) or UP (4, 3) to approach it.\n3. If (6, 3) is gone, target (0, 2) (D=4) via LEFT.\n\nUP",

Moves away from (6, 3) but closer to (0, 2) (D=3).\n\nSince both UP and RIGHT yield the maximum distance reduction to the target (6, 3), we prioritize one that maximizes safety and future options.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (Snake #0 at (5, 4)):**\nSnake #0's most threatening moves:\n*   UP (5, 5) - Neutral.\n*   DOWN (5, 3) - Moves closer to (6, 3), D=1+0=1 closer.\n*   RIGHT (6, 4) - Moves closer to (6, 3), D=0+1=1 closer.\n*   LEFT (4, 4) - Neutral/slightly away from (6, 3).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 3) and we move RIGHT to (5, 2), we are separated by 1 square (y-axis).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 4) and we move RIGHT to (5, 2), we are far apart.\n\nThe key risk is that Snake #0 can reach (6, 3) in two moves: e.g., (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3), or (5, 4) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 2), we are 2 steps away from (6, 3).\n(5, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3) or (5, 2) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3).\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 3), we are also 2 steps away from (6, 3).\n(4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3) or (4, 3) -> (4, 4)... wait, the best path is (4, 3) -> (5, 3) or (6, 3) which is 2 moves.\n\nMoving RIGHT (5, 2) or UP (4, 3) are both excellent positioning moves. (5, 2) seems slightly more direct for the next turn, as (5, 2) -> RIGHT (6, 2) reduces x-distance and prepares for UP to (6, 3).\n\n*Path via RIGHT (5, 2):*\nT9: (4, 2) -> (5, 2) [D=2 to A1]\nT10: (5, 2) -> (6, 2) [D=1 to A1]\nT11: (6, 2) -> (6, 3) [Eat A1]\n\n*Path via UP (4, 3):*\nT9: (4, 2) -> (4, 3) [D=2 to A1]\nT10: (4, 3) -> (5, 3) [D=1 to A1]\nT11: (5, 3) -> (6, 3) [Eat A1] (Risk: if Snake 0 moves (5, 4) -> (5, 3) this turn, we collide next turn T10!)\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN (5, 3) this turn (T9):\nIf we move UP (4, 3), we are safe now, but if we move RIGHT (5, 3) next turn (T10), we hit Snake 0's head/new body.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP (5, 5) this turn (T9):\nIf we move UP (4, 3), we are safe.

(5, 3) is a natural path for the enemy to take to approach (6, 3) or simply extend their length.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (5, 2) seems safer as it keeps us further from the direct line of sight of Snake #0's immediate downward movement, and still maintains the aggressive pursuit of (6, 3).\n\nLet's confirm the safety for moving RIGHT to (5, 2).\nHead: (4, 2) -> (5, 2). Safe from self and enemy. (5, 2) is a clear space.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 3) this turn:\nT10 plan from (5, 2): Move UP (5, 3) is now lethal collision/body segment. Move RIGHT (6, 2) is still viable to get to (6, 3).\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we are maximizing our chances of reaching (6, 3) slightly faster and more safely than the UP path which is more vulnerable to the enemy's aggressive move towards (6, 3) via (5, 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 10):**\nHead will be at (5, 2). Target remains (6, 3).\n1. Is (6, 3) still present?\n2. If yes, target (6, 2) via RIGHT, then (6, 3) (if clear) or (5, 3) (if clear). Watch Snake #0 position, especially if it moved to (5, 3) or (6, 4).\n3. If (6, 3) is gone, target (0, 2) (D=5) or (8, 0) (D=4, slightly closer).\nFrom (5, 2): D((0, 2))=5, D((8, 0))=3+2=5. Wait, 8-5=3, 2-0=2. D=5.\n(0, 2) is better now, 5-0=5, 2-2=0. D=5. The target is A4 (9, 2) D=4. (D=5 to (8, 0)).\n\nA: (5, 2) -> (9, 2) is 4 steps R. D=4. New best contingency.\n\nRIGHT",

We need to consider Snake #0 at (6, 4).\n\n**Scenario 1: Move UP to (5, 3).**\n*   New Head: (5, 3). Ready to move RIGHT or UP to reach (6, 3) or (5, 4) respectively.\n*   Next turn (T11), we could move RIGHT to (6, 3) [EAT!] or UP to (5, 4).\n\n**Scenario 2: Move RIGHT to (6, 2).**\n*   New Head: (6, 2). Ready to move UP to reach (6, 3).\n*   Next turn (T11), we could move UP to (6, 3) [EAT!].\n\n**Considering Enemy Snake #0 at (6, 4):**\nSnake #0 has the following moves: (5, 4), (7, 4), (6, 5), (6, 3).\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (6, 3)** (T10), it eats the apple.\n    *   If we move UP to (5, 3), we are safe, but the apple is gone.\n    *   If we move RIGHT to (6, 2), we are safe, but the apple is gone.\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves **LEFT to (5, 4)** (T10).\n    *   If we move UP to (5, 3): Collision risk on T11 if Snake #0 moves DOWN (5, 3) or we move UP (to 5, 4). This path (5, 3) is now right below the enemy head.\n    *   If we move RIGHT to (6, 2): We are safe. T11 move UP (6, 3) is still clear, and T12 (7, 3), etc. Snake #0 at (5, 4) is now irrelevant.\n\n*   If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 4)** or **UP to (6, 5)** (T10), it moves away from the apple (6, 3).\n    *   Both our moves (UP or RIGHT) result in guaranteed apple capture on T11.\n\n**Decision: Racing the Enemy to (6, 3).**\nSnake #0 can capture (6, 3) this turn (T10) by moving DOWN. If we move UP or RIGHT, we cannot interfere with its path, as we are located at (5, 2) and they are at (6, 4).\n\nSince the enemy can eat the apple immediately, we must assume they will try to.\n\n**Contingency Plan (If (6, 3) is gone):**\nIf the apple at (6, 3) is gone, we must immediately pivot.\n\n*   From (5, 3) (if we moved UP):\n    *   New closest apple is (9, 2). D = 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   (0, 2). D = 5 + 1 = 6.\n    *   (8, 0). D = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n*   From (6, 2) (if we moved RIGHT):\n    *   New closest apple is (9, 2). D = 3 + 0 = 3. **This is much better.**\n    *   (8, 0). D = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nIf Snake #0 captures (6, 3) this turn, moving RIGHT to (6, 2) gives us a significant advantage in pursuing the next closest apple, (9, 2).\n\nThe move RIGHT maximizes our flexibility and minimizes risk associated with Snake #0 potentially blocking the middle column (5, Y) or interfering with the path via (5, 3). It also positions us optimally if the current target is successfully eaten by the enemy.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the superior choice.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 11):**\nHead will be at (6, 2).\n1. Check if (6, 3) is still present. If yes, move UP to eat.\n2. If (6, 3) is gone, target (9, 2) (D=3). Path: (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

This seems unlikely for them.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 4), they are 3 steps away from (7, 5).\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (6, 3), they hit my head and die (or we collide).\n\n**Safety and Movement Strategy from Head (6, 3):**\nMy body segments: (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1).\n\n1.  **UP (to (6, 4))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   **Into enemy head: Yes, Snake #0 is at (6, 4).** Dead-on collision. *Fatal.*\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (6, 2))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   **Into own body: Yes, (6, 2) is the segment directly behind the head.** *Fatal.*\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (5, 3))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Into enemy body/head: No.\n    *   *Safe.* (Moves away from (7, 5), towards (0, 2) and (4, 9).)\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (7, 3))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Into enemy body/head: No.\n    *   *Safe.* (Moves towards (7, 5), (9, 2), and (8, 0).)\n\n**Candidate Moves: LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on at T=12):**\nHead @ (6, 3).

(They would need to move RIGHT to (7, 4) and then DOWN to (7, 3), but they only get one move.)\n    *   If Enemy goes RIGHT (7, 4): No collision.\n    *   If Enemy goes DOWN (6, 3): Enemy hits my current head position (we moved) or, more accurately, we both arrive at (6, 3) if they move DOWN and we move into that cell. Wait, they move to (6, 3) and we move to (7, 3). If they move DOWN to (6, 3), they move into the cell we just vacated.

Safe.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nTarget (7, 5) seems appealing, but (6, 4) is directly contesting the top area. If I move RIGHT to (7, 3), I secure a strong position on the right side of the board and set up for A5 (7, 5) or A2 (9, 2)/A1 (8, 0). (7, 3) is 2 steps from (7, 5) and 3 steps from (9, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 3), I concede the right side (where three apples are concentrated) to Snake #0, and I move toward less dense apple areas (A4 at (0, 2), A3 at (4, 9)).\n\nGiven the apple distribution (A(8, 0), A(9, 2), A(7, 5) on the right), favoring RIGHT seems better for collecting apples.\n\nMove: RIGHT (7, 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 13):**\nHead at (7, 3), Length 5.\nEnemy Snake #0 likely at (7, 4) or (5, 4) or (6, 5).\nNearest apples: (7, 5) [D=2], (9, 2) [D=3], (8, 0) [D=3].\nIf (7, 5) is open, move UP/RIGHT to grab it. If Snake #0 is moving towards it (e.g., at (7, 4)), prioritize (9, 2) or (8, 0) to avoid direct confrontation while maintaining apple advantage. Moving toward (8, 3) or (7, 4) next turn seems ideal. (7, 4) is the direct path to (7, 5). We must check if Snake #0 is there.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, checking the body list: (6, 3) is behind (7, 3), (6, 2) is behind (6, 3), (5, 2) is behind (6, 2), (4, 2) is behind (5, 2). The tail is (4, 2). This is correct for movement RIGHT from (6, 3) to (7, 3).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 (Length 1)\n  - Head: (6, 5) (Enemy #0 likely moved UP from (6, 4) to (6, 5) on T=12, as this was the safest direction away from my movement and towards the upper apples.)\n\nApples remaining: (8, 0), (9, 2), (4, 9), (0, 2), (7, 5).\n\n**Target Selection:**\n\n1.  **(7, 5)**: Distance from (7, 3): D = 0 + 2 = 2. (Closest)\n2.  **(9, 2)**: Distance from (7, 3): D = 2 + 1 = 3.\n3.  **(8, 0)**: Distance from (7, 3): D = 1 + 3 = 4.\n4.  **(4, 9)**: Distance from (7, 3): D = 3 + 6 = 9.\n5.  **(0, 2)**: Distance from (7, 3): D = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nTarget A5 (7, 5) is the immediate priority. Requires 2 moves.\n\n**Enemy Position and Threat (Snake #0 at (6, 5)):**\nSnake #0 is slightly NW of me. They are likely aiming for (7, 5) as well.\n\nDistance from Snake #0 (6, 5) to target (7, 5): D = 1 + 0 = 1.\nDistance from Snake #0 (6, 5) to target (4, 9): D = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nSnake #0 is 1 step away from (7, 5). If they move RIGHT to (7, 5), they eat the apple. If I move UP to (7, 4) and then UP again, I will be one step too slow.\n\nIt is highly probable Snake #0 will move RIGHT to (7, 5) and consume the apple this turn (T=13).\n\nIf (7, 5) is lost, the next best targets are (9, 2) (D=3) and (8, 0) (D=4). Both are easily accessed by moving RIGHT or DOWN/RIGHT.\n\n**Safety and Movement Strategy from Head (7, 3):**\nMy body segments: (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2).\n\n1.  **UP (to (7, 4))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Into enemy (6, 5): Safe. (Enemy is 1 step away, enemy cannot reach (7, 4) unless they go DOWN/RIGHT diagonally, which is impossible.)\n    *   If I move UP, I position myself optimally for the next target, regardless of whether Snake #0 gets (7, 5).\n    *   *Safe.*\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 2))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Path towards (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n    *   *Safe.* (Moves away from Snake #0 and sets up for lower apples.)\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 3))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: Yes, (6, 3) is the segment directly behind the head. *Fatal.*\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 3))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Path towards (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n    *   *Safe.*\n\n**Candidate Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nWe must anticipate Snake #0's move:\nSnake #0 at (6, 5). Nearest apple is (7, 5).\n*   Expected Move for S0: RIGHT (to (7, 5)). S0 will eat the apple.\n\nIf S0 eats (7, 5), we must pivot to the next best target.\nTarget (9, 2) is D=3 away.\nTarget (8, 0) is D=4 away.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 4):\n  *   Next turn: I am 2 steps from (9, 2) and 3 steps from (8, 0).\n  *   I am slightly closer to S0 who may be blocking the upper path later.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3):\n  *   Next turn: I am 1 step from (9, 2) (via (9, 3) or (8, 2)) and 3 steps from (8, 0).\n  *   (9, 2) is a very defensible apple, located cornered between the edge and my current position.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 2):\n  *   Next turn: I am 2 steps from (9, 2) and 2 steps from (8, 0). This is excellent positioning for the bottom apples.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n\n1.  **If I go DOWN (7, 2):**\n    *   T+1: Targets (9, 2) (2 steps via (8, 2) RIGHT or (7, 1) DOWN) and (8, 0) (2 steps via (8, 1) RIGHT/DOWN).\n    *   These targets are very close and equally appealing.\n\n2.  **If I go RIGHT (8, 3):**\n    *   T+1: Target (9, 2) (2 steps via (9, 3) RIGHT/DOWN). Target (8, 0) (3 steps via (8, 2) DOWN/DOWN).\n    *   (9, 2) is still closer, but (8, 0) is slightly farther than if I moved DOWN.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 2) seems slightly more efficient for conquering the lower eastern corner, securing both (9, 2) and (8, 0) with a flexible approach path. Snake #0 is moving North/East, so moving South helps me maximize safety and capture apples on the periphery.\n\nLet's stick with DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 14):**\nHead at (7, 2), Length 5.\nS0 likely ate (7, 5) and is now at (7, 5), Length 2.\nNext targets are (9, 2) (D=2) and (8, 0) (D=2).\nPriority: Based on local board space, (9, 2) is easier to secure. Move toward (8, 2) or (7, 1). If I move RIGHT (8, 2), I'm 1 step from (9, 2) and 2 steps from (8, 0). If I move DOWN (7, 1), I'm 3 steps from (9, 2) and 1 step from (8, 0). RIGHT seems slightly better to collect (9, 2) first, especially if S0 is still up high.\n\nDOWN",

(Right 1) **(Immediate Apple)**\n2.  **(8, 0)**: Distance D = 0 + 2 = 2.

No immediate interference.\n    *   *Safe.*\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (8, 1))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   Path towards (8, 0).\n    *   *Safe.*\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (7, 2))**:\n    *   Into own body: Yes, (7, 2) is the segment directly behind the head. **Fatal.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (9, 2))**:\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Into own body: No.\n    *   **Apple at (9, 2).** This is the target.\n    *   *Safe.*\n\n**Candidate Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\nThe move RIGHT to (9, 2) secures an apple and increases our lead (5 apples vs S0's 1). This is the highest priority move.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S0 at (7, 4), Length 2):**\nS0's possible moves: UP (7, 5 - into tail/body), DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4).\n*   S0 cannot move UP to (7, 5) (into its own tail or the segment instantly behind). S0's tail this turn is where its head was last turn, which is (7, 5). Wait, S0's body is [(7, 5)]. Since a snake shrinks when it doesn't eat, and S0 did not eat last turn, the tail (7, 5) *will vacate* unless S0 moves into it. The rule is you cannot move into the cell *directly behind* your head, which would be (7, 5). S0's head is (7, 4), body is [(7, 5)]. Moving UP to (7, 5) hits its body. **FATAL for S0.**\n*   Therefore, S0 must move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nDistances for S0 from (7, 4):\n*   To (3, 5): D = 4 + 1 = 5\n*   To (0, 2): D = 7 + 2 = 9\n*   To (8, 0): D = 1 + 4 = 5\n*   To (4, 9): D = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nS0 is likely targeting (3, 5) or (8, 0).\n*   If S0 moves DOWN (to (7, 3)), they move towards (8, 0) (D=3). This puts S0 close to the far-right body segment of my snake (7, 3).\n*   If S0 moves LEFT (to (6, 4)), they move towards (3, 5) (D=4).\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT (to (8, 4)), they move towards the corner/edge.\n\nMy move is RIGHT to (9, 2).\n*   My head moves to (9, 2).\n*   My body shifts: (8, 2) becomes the first body segment.\n*   My tail (6, 2) stays, as I am eating an apple. New state length 6.\n\nS0's potential moves do not threaten my destination (9, 2) or my safety.\n\nEven if S0 moves DOWN to (7, 3), that spot is currently occupied by the second segment of my body. When I move RIGHT, (7, 3) becomes the third segment. My previous head (8, 2) becomes the first segment, and the true tail (6, 2) remains. (7, 3) will not shift until the queue reaches it. Therefore, if S0 moves to (7, 3), they would hit my segment (7, 3) and die.\n\nHowever, the question is just about my move. Moving RIGHT is safe and guarantees an apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 16):**\nHead will be at (9, 2), Length 6. Next apple target is (8, 0), which is 2 steps away (DOWN, DOWN). S0 is likely moving towards the center/bottom due to my actions. Secure (8, 0) next to clear the Southeast corner of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Since I am not eating this turn, my true tail (6, 2) will vacate, and the previous position of (6, 3) (which is (6, 3)) will become the new tail segment, but it will only vacate the position *before* (6, 3) which is (7, 3) (which shifts to where (6, 3) was). Wait, this is difficult.\n\nLet's track my tail movement if I move DOWN (to 9, 1) and do not eat:\n1. Head moves: (9, 2) -> (9, 1)\n2.

My new length 5 body segments: (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3).\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (6, 3), they hit my *new* tail segment (6, 3). **S0 dies.** This is a possibility and does not affect my safety.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (6, 5), they are moving towards (3, 5) or (4, 9).\n\nMy move to (9, 1) is completely safe from S0 as we are far apart.\n\nThe planned movement is DOWN to get closer to (8, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Note for Future Self (Turn 17):**\nHead will be at (9, 1).
