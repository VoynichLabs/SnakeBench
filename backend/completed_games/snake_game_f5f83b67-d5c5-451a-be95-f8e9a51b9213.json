Possible moves from (5, 4):\n  - UP: (5, 5)\n  - DOWN: (5, 3)\n  - LEFT: (4, 4)\n  - RIGHT: (6, 4)\n\n### Long-Term Strategy:\n- **Prioritize apple collection**: The apple at (5, 3) is the closest and safest to collect. Moving **LEFT** to (5, 3) will allow us to eat it and grow our snake.\n- **Avoid enemy interference**: Snake #0 could move to (5, 3) if it chooses **DOWN**, but since we move simultaneously, we can still safely take the apple unless Snake #0 also moves to (5, 3). However, since Snake #0 is currently at (5, 4) and its body is at (5, 5), it cannot move to (5, 3) in one turn (it would have to move **DOWN** twice, which is impossible). Thus, we can safely take the apple.\n- **Future flexibility**: After eating the apple, we will have a longer body, so we need to ensure we don\u2019t get trapped. Moving **LEFT** to (5, 3) keeps us aligned with potential future paths toward other apples.\n\n### Decision:\nMove **LEFT** to (5, 3) to collect the apple and grow our snake.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:\n1. **Next turn (from (5, 3))**: After eating the apple, our body will be [(5, 3), (6, 3)]. We need to prioritize moving away from the apple\u2019s original position to avoid getting trapped.\n   - Possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (but avoid moving back to (6, 3) immediately).\n   - **UP** to (5, 4) is safe but may be contested by Snake #0.\n   - **DOWN** to (5, 2) is safe and opens up new paths.\n   - **RIGHT** to (6, 3) is safe but may not be optimal for future growth.\n   - **LEFT** to (4, 3) is safe and opens up space toward the apple at (2, 4).\n2. **Future goals**:\n   - Continue expanding toward reachable apples while maintaining path diversity.\n   - Monitor Snake #0\u2019s movement to avoid head-on collisions or getting trapped.\n   - Avoid corners where we could get trapped (e.g., (0, 2) is near a corner).\n   - If Snake #0 moves aggressively, consider defensive maneuvers to keep it away from our path.\n   - Aim to reach the apple at (2, 4) next, as it is the next closest reachable apple.\n\nLEFT",

Watch for enemy flanking column 5 southwards.\n\nUpon eating (5,3), snake to length 3 [head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)]. Pivot based on enemy: if they gravitate south column 5/6, zip LEFT to (4,3) then zig towards (4,4)? LEFT/RIGHT for (2,4) apple loop, avoiding bottom edge traps.
