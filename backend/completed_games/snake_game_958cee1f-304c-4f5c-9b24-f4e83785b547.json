Any move that takes me off the board (x < 0, x > 9, y < 0, y > 9) is a death. Also, I need to avoid hitting the snake at (0, 6) and the apples at (8, 4), (1, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (4, 3). Moving backwards (to (7,4)) is a death.\n\nThe snake at (0, 6) is a threat, and the apples are also considerations. I currently have no body, so I can eat apples.\n\nLooking at the board, moving right to (7,4) looks appealing, and I am currently adjacent to the apple at (8,4). However, we are already moving and cannot go backwards into our body. Let's weigh the alternatives:\n\n*   **RIGHT (7,4):** Consumes the apple at (8,4), increases my score. Relies on the other snake not moving to block that path.\n*   **DOWN (6,5):** Takes me away from the apple at (8,4) but might provide a longer-term path.\n*   **UP (6,3):**  Takes me away from the apple at (8,4), but moves me to a potentially dangerous spot given the snake at (0,6).\n*   **LEFT (5,4):** A safer option, avoids the immediate threat, and puts me closer to the apple at (5,8).\n\nGiven the limited number of turns, focusing on safely gaining apples is prudent. The snake at (0,6) is the biggest immediate threat. Moving up is more dangerous. Moving left or right is safer but offers less immediate benefit. Moving down to (6,5) seems like the safer choice as it continues to allow me to grow without immediate hazard.\n\nTherefore, I'll move to (6, 5) to increase my score without increasing the immediately lethal risk.\n\nUP",

Moving up to (6, 3) would get me away from the apple at (8, 4) and potentially reduce risk, but it could put me in a more vulnerable position given the nearby snake at (0, 6). Moving left to (5, 4) would avoid the immediate threat of (0,6) but it leaves me relatively far from the apple at (5, 8).\n\nI believe the safest and most strategically sound move is to move *up* to (6, 5).

Snake #0 is at (1, 7) with a body at (1, 6). The board is 10x10.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the safe moves. Moving directly up to (6, 5) seems like a viable option to collect the apple at (8, 4) without directly confronting Snake #0, and it avoids hitting my tail.\nHowever, I need to consider that Snake #0 is at (1, 7). If Snake #0 moves upwards, it might get into a position where it is about to clash with me, even if I move upwards.\n\nLet's evaluate the possibilities.\n* **UP:** Moves me to (6, 5). I would eat the apple at (8, 4), score 1 point, and have a clearer path for future moves and be away from immediate collision with snake #0.\n* **DOWN:** Moves me to (6, 3). I would eat the apple at (8, 4), but it would bring me dangerously close to snake #0.  If snake #0 moves up, I'm in trouble.\n* **LEFT:** Moves me to (5, 4). I could eat the apple at (5, 6). However, I would be significantly away from the apple at (8,4) if Snake #0 moves up.\n* **RIGHT:** Moves me to (7, 4). I would eat the apple at (8, 4). However, as we discussed earlier, Snake #0 is at (1, 7) and moving upwards would put me in a potentially hazardous situation.\n\nConsidering that I want to efficiently collect the apple at (8, 4) without immediately confronting snake #0, moving *up* to (6, 5) seems the optimal move. It allows the collection of an apple with a high probability of not being in a collision with snake #0.\n\nLong-term plan: My primary goal is to maximize apple collection while avoiding collisions. The immediate focus is on strategically moving towards reachable apples and leaving a safe path for later moves.\n\nUP",

The enemy head is at (6,6) and has no body right now. Board edges are respected.\n- Immediate safety: DOWN would move into your own body at (1,6) (and is explicitly a deadly move). LEFT to (0,7), UP to (1,8), or RIGHT to (2,7) are all safe in this turn.\n- Objective and safety tradeoff: None of the four moves eats an apple this turn, so the goal is to preserve options and head toward reachable apples without getting trapped.\n  - UP to (1,8): keeps you on a path toward the apple at (5,8); from there you can proceed along row 8 to reach (5,8) in a few moves. It also keeps space to maneuver away from the enemy.\n  - RIGHT to (2,7): also moves toward the apples (particularly (5,8) and (5,6)); it maintains flexibility and avoids a corner. Slightly more centralized than UP in the long term.\n  - LEFT to (0,7): farther from the nearest apples in the short term, riskier to reach them soon, and may reduce options.\n- Head-to-head risk: The enemy at (6,6) could move to (5,6), (6,7), (7,6), or (6,5). Our potential next heads (1,8), (2,7), or (0,7) do not collide with any of those targets this turn, so head-on collision is unlikely this turn under typical play.\n- Plan consideration: If we head toward (5,8) now, we can follow a straightforward path along y=8 to eat that apple in several turns, minimizing risk and keeping space from the enemy\u2019s current location.\n\nPlan for next moves:\n- Favor UP to (1,8) now to head toward the row-8 apple (5,8). From there, proceed RIGHT along row 8 toward (5,8) in the following turns, eating it when reached. Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s decisions around (5,6) and (5,8), and avoid any potential dead-ends or traps by staying with room to maneuver.\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is at (2, 8) with a body at (1, 8) and one apple.\n\nI have to avoid Snake #0. Moving up to (6, 5) is a good option because it allows me to eat the apple at (8, 4) without immediately colliding with Snake #0. Snake #0 is currently at (2, 8). If I move up, my head will be at (6, 5) and I will be directly in Snake #0's path. However, Snake #0 will be moving upwards, so if I stay at (6, 7), I'll be within snake #0's path.\nTherefore, moving up is the best option to secure the apple and avoid immediate conflict.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI want to reach apple (8, 4) as soon as possible, while avoiding collision with Snake #0. Moving up from (6, 7) to (6, 5) is the safest choice. This position puts me directly in the path of Snake #0, but it allows me to reach the apple without him. I will be moving up, and Snake #0 will also be moving upwards. After I eat the apple, I will be at (6, 5), and then I will have to decide on the next move based on Snake #0\u2019s movement. This move allows me to stay relatively safe for the foreseeable future.\n\nLong-term plan: The plan is to continue collecting apples while minimizing the chances of a head-on collision with Snake #0 and avoid being cornered. I'm prioritizing the apple at (8,4) and maintaining a safe path.\n\nUP",

It also preserves escape paths along the top edge for future turns while still keeping future options open toward apples.\n\nShort-term plan: Move UP to (2,9) now. On subsequent turns, reassess enemy movement and selectively approach apples if safe, prioritizing routes that avoid trapping myself and potential head-on collisions.\n\nDecision:\nUP",
