Therefore, there's no body yet occupying (2,1), which makes UP still safe.\n\nHowever, let's consider the most suitable next target carefully:\n- Apple (7,1) is relatively close in horizontal direction (5 steps to the right, 1 step upward).\n- Apple (0,5) clearly reachable, but somewhat more distant (2 steps left, 5 upward).\n- Apple (9,5), (2,9) are currently quite far away\u2014we leave those for now.\n\nClearly, (7,1) seems optimal as the next apple to target right away because it's closest horizontally.\n\nLet's carefully consider a direct path going RIGHT and then later UP/RIGHT toward apple (7,1):\n- (3,0): safe\n- (4,0): safe\n- (5,0): safe\n- (6,0): safe\n- (7,0): safe\n- Then moving UP to (7,1): apple there, clearly safe and reachable from below side.\n\nClearly the RIGHT path is safe and straightforward toward the next apple goal.\n\nStrategy reminder for next turn:\nContinue moving clearly RIGHT steadily toward apple at (7,1), unless unforeseen circumstances arise next turn that demand adjustment.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT"

The apple at (6, 7) is now only 2 moves away (RIGHT to (5, 7), then RIGHT again to (6, 7)).\n\nGoing LEFT would be suicide since I'd hit my own body.

Once I collect that apple, I should reassess and likely target either (2, 9) or (0, 5) as they're relatively accessible, while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position.\n\nRIGHT"

It will give me more room to maneuver and potentially set up a path toward multiple apples without immediately constraining my movement options.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP, I should start planning a route toward one of the apples. The apple at (2, 9) could be a good target since it's in the upper area, or I could work my way toward the left side apples while being mindful of my growing body length.\n\nUP"

I see there's an apple at (7, 7) according to the apple list and the board visualization shows \"A\" at that position.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at (4, 2) with no body, so they're still far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nThis is another great opportunity! Moving RIGHT will immediately give me another apple at (7, 7), growing my snake further and giving me another point. This would put me at 2 points after just 2 moves, which is excellent progress.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to reassess. The remaining apples will be at (2, 0), (2, 9), (0, 5), and (9, 5). I should probably start working toward one of the corner/edge apples like (2, 9) or (9, 5) next, depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (7, 7), evaluate paths to the remaining apples (2, 0), (2, 9), (0, 5), and (9, 5). Consider going for (9, 5) since it's on the same row, or (2, 9) for good positioning.\n\nRIGHT"

Perhaps move UP or LEFT toward apple at (0,5) afterward.\n- Always check enemy snake movements and coordinates again to avoid unexpected collision or threats.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT"

There's no strategic benefit for DOWN currently.\n\nTaking into account freedom of movement and future safety:\n- RIGHT (4, 2) brings me directly closer horizontally towards the cluster of apples on the right side.\n- UP (3, 3) slightly moves me away vertically, but creates a more \"middle-of-board\" position, granting flexibility; however it doesn\u2019t clearly move toward any closer apples either.\n\nIn conclusion, RIGHT is clearly the best strategic move, as it continues positioning my snake safely and incrementally toward the apple-rich right-side area.

I'll start moving upwards to take a direct route and reassess my position each turn to safely approach the apple.\n\nNext moves strategy:\nProceed upwards carefully towards (6,7), while checking positions of the enemy snake to avoid any collision.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

From (4, 7), I could continue left to get closer horizontally, then move up when needed. This path also keeps me away from the bottom area where the enemy snake is located.\n\nThe enemy snake at (3, 0) is still far from me and focused on the bottom apples, so I don't need to worry about direct competition for the (2, 9) apple right now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving LEFT toward (2, 9) apple, then plan to move UP when I get closer horizontally. Keep monitoring my body position to avoid boxing myself in, and watch for the enemy snake's movements.\n\nLEFT"

So I must first navigate around or upward to approach any remaining apples.\n\nImmediate safety check from my current head position (1,0):\n- LEFT is (0,0): SAFE; empty square, no immediate hazard.\n- UP is (1,1): SAFE; empty square, and allows future upward progression toward apple at (0,5) or (3,2).\n- RIGHT is (2,0): NOT SAFE; occupied by my own body segment.\n- DOWN is (1,-1): NOT SAFE; would move off the game board.\n\nConsidering my safety check and overall apple distribution:\n- LEFT to (0,0): Possible position, but isolates me in a corner. Still usable.\n- UP to (1,1): More strategic move as it grants future access upward toward apples at (0,5) and (3,2). Opens vertical direction for flexible future moves.\n\nThus, moving UP this turn seems clearly optimal strategically. Moving UP keeps me safe and aligns me for pursuing further apples above.\n\nStrategy notes for next turns:\n- After moving UP, consider moving upwards again toward apples at (0,5) or (3,2).\n- Pay close attention to the enemy snake moves and board boundaries continually. Avoid getting cornered or isolated.\n- Maintain flexibility in movement. Don't trap myself unnecessarily.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Avoid getting cornered or isolated.\n- Maintain flexibility in movement. Don't trap myself unnecessarily.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Or carefully maneuver for better positioning if body length starts becoming problematic.\n\nOverall Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:\n- Continually track positioning of your head and body segments each turn after apples eaten, preventing self-collision as your snake grows.\n- Prioritize movement towards remaining nearby apples when clearly and immediately accessible safely.\n\nFinal Decision based upon careful consideration above:\nUP"

Immediate growth is advantageous, increasing score and snake length.\n- Even though DOWN is safe temporarily, there is no reason to consider it when an apple is immediately adjacent in another safe direction.\n- After taking apple at (9,2), I should consider continuing upwards towards another apple at (9,4) if safely possible, ensuring consistent point accumulation and growth. Or carefully maneuver for better positioning if body length starts becoming problematic.\n\nOverall Strategy Reminder for Next Turn:\n- Continually track positioning of your head and body segments each turn after apples eaten, preventing self-collision as your snake grows.\n- Prioritize movement towards remaining nearby apples when clearly and immediately accessible safely.\n\nFinal Decision based upon careful consideration above:\nUP"

Immediate benefit of increasing length and gaining a point. Optimal choice clearly identified.\n- DOWN back to (9,2): occupied by my own body. Instant death\u2014BAD.\n- LEFT to (8,3): appears empty and safe, but no immediate strategic benefit since apple is directly above.\n- RIGHT to (10,3): clearly outside boundaries. Death again\u2014unacceptable.\n\nConclusion:\nThe path quickly and clearly optimal: Moving UP onto the apple (9,4).  \nThis step directly leads to growth, gaining another point. Additionally, I must carefully plan the next moves after growing longer and avoid trapping myself in future turns.\n\nFuture-Turn Strategy Reminder:\n- After grabbing the apple at (9,4), cautiously plan further maneuvering. Apple at (9,8) is vertically upwards and reachable thereafter.\n- Always remain careful and vigilant to avoid any direct threats or self-traps with my own longer body.\n\nThus, the decision remains clearly beneficial and confirmed:\n\nDecided next move: UP"

My updated body after growth:\n  Current head: (9,4)\n  Body segments now: [(9,3), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)] (same as before, but the tail segment at (5,2) remains because of growth this turn.)\n- Clearly reassessing apples: currently visible remaining apples are (8,0), (6,0), (9,8), (0,0), and (2,1).  \n- The nearest clearly available apple from (9,4) is directly upwards at (9,8), which is vertically four moves away.\n- Enemy snake remains at position (3,7).

Dangerous\u2014Instant death. No option.\n- LEFT (8,4): clearly safe, open, unoccupied space.\n- RIGHT (10,4): immediate death by leaving boundaries. Clearly not an acceptable option.\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n1. Apple above at (9,8) remains my primary target clearly visible. This apple is straightforward vertically upwards and safely attainable over subsequent moves (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), and then (9,8).\n2. Consider that flowing upwards toward (9,8) is safe and clear, not encountering any immediate hazards. An optimal clear and simple plan: head upward directly toward (9,8).\n3. After capturing (9,8), remain mindful that my body length will grow further, and I should consider space to navigate carefully afterwards.\n\nCurrent Optimal Move Clearly Identified:\nUP remains clearly the most strategically beneficial and safe move.\n\nReminder for next turn's self:\n- Continue moving carefully and directly upwards toward apple at (9,8), unless the environment clearly changes next turn and another safer move appears.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
