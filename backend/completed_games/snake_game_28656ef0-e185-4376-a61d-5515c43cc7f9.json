The cell is currently empty (only marked as A for apple), so no collision issue. Safe move.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Would move to (1, 6): Empty cell, but moves me away from the apple at (1, 8) and the cluster of apples at the bottom.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Would move to (0, 7): Empty cell, but takes me toward the board edge. Fewer apples in that direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Would move to (2, 7): Empty cell, but moves me away from the nearby apples.\n\nMy snake #1 is at (8, 2), quite far from me at (1, 7), so no immediate collision risk.\n\nThe optimal move is clearly UP - it immediately collects an apple, gives me my first point and grows my snake, while also being completely safe (no wall collision, no self-collision since I have no body yet, and no enemy collision).\n\n**Rationale:** Move UP to (1, 8) to eat the apple there. This gives me an early lead (1-0) and grows my snake, while the position at (1, 8) will still offer good flexibility for future moves toward the other nearby apples at (4, 1) and (7, 1).\n\nUP",

However, I should think about collisions with snake #0's possible moves.  \n\n**Where could Snake #0 move from (1, 7)?**  \nIts options: (1, 6), (2, 7), (1, 8), (0, 7). None of those overlap with my possible moves, except maybe (1, 8) has an apple but isn\u2019t where I can go this turn. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Apples**:  \nClosest apple is at (7, 1), reachable in a few moves. Second closest: (7, 4).  \nMaybe start moving toward (7, 1) because it's closer (distance 2 in Manhattan terms: |8-7| + |2-1| = 2).  \n\n**Safe paths**:  \n- DOWN then LEFT gets apple next turn.  \n- LEFT then DOWN also works, but LEFT first (to 7, 2) doesn\u2019t get me closer faster unless I go DOWN afterward.  \n\nActually, if I go DOWN now to (8, 1), then next turn I can go LEFT to (7, 1) for the apple.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (7, 2), then next turn I'd still need two moves (DOWN then LEFT? Wait, from (7,2) to (7,1) is DOWN, then I have it). Hmm, both DOWN now or LEFT now allow me to get to (7,1) in two moves.  \n\nBut DOWN immediately reduces distance to apple from 2 to 1. LEFT keeps distance at 2. So DOWN is slightly better for minimizing distance to the nearest apple.  \n\nAlso, staying away from enemy for now is fine; they are far away.  \n\n**Plan**:  \nMove toward nearest apples while keeping options open. Start with DOWN to get apple next turn if possible.  \n\n**Final choice**:  \nDOWN  \n\n**RATIONALE**:  \nHeading toward nearest apple at (7,1) by decreasing distance this turn. Next turn, plan to go LEFT to eat it unless danger appears. Keep enemy snake in mind later when closer.  \n\nDOWN",

The cell appears empty (just \". \" in the board display). This is safe - no collision with my own body (my tail is at (1, 7)) and no immediate enemy threat.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Would move to (1, 7): This is my own tail!

Wait, simultaneous movement:  \nWhen I eat apple, I grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn, so tail stays at (8, 1) until after I move next turn? Actually, in Snake mechanics:  \n1. Move head to new cell.  \n2. If apple eaten, add new body segment at old tail position (tail doesn\u2019t move), so length increases by 1.  \n3. If no apple eaten, tail moves forward (whole snake shifts).  \n\nSo after eating apple this turn:  \n- Head at (7, 1)  \n- Body: [(8, 1)]  \n- Tail at (8, 1)  \n\nNext turn, tail stays put because we ate apple, so moving RIGHT to (8, 1) would collide with own body \u2014 so avoid that next turn.  \n\nBut this turn, LEFT is safe and gets apple.  \n\nLEFT",

Continues toward the right edge.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP is immediately fatal (moving into my own body)\n- The enemy snake is at (5, 4) with a long body (5 segments total), giving them significant reach\n- The apple at (7, 5) is immediately accessible by moving DOWN\n- The enemy is closer to apples (4, 1) and potentially (0, 5), so they'll likely pursue those\n- Taking the apple at (7, 5) grows my body and improves my position relative to the enemy\n- After eating the apple, I'll need to plan my next moves carefully to avoid getting trapped\n\n**Optimal move:**\nDOWN gets me the apple at (7, 5), grows my body to 2 segments, and gets me closer to being competitive with the enemy who already has 4 apples. This is the most valuable move available.\n\n**Future planning:**\nAfter collecting (7, 5), my head will be at (7, 5) with body at (7, 6), (7, 7). I should then be able to go LEFT to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (7, 4) to get the next apple. I need to be careful about not boxing myself in as my body grows longer.\n\nDOWN",

Safe move. Opens up options to continue UP or move LEFT/RIGHT along row 5.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Would move to (8, 3): On board, empty cell. Safe move. Puts me closer to the apple at (4, 3).\n\n3. **LEFT** - Would move to (7, 4): This is my own body segment (neck)! Moving into my body would kill me. **Eliminated**.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Would move to (9, 4): On board, empty cell. Safe move. This brings me to the right edge of the board.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- LEFT is immediately fatal (moving into my own neck at (7, 4))\n- The enemy snake is at (6, 2), likely moving toward the apple at (4, 3) or (4, 1)\n- I need to pursue apples while maintaining safe movement options\n- The right side of the board is relatively uncontested\n\n**Available safe moves:** UP, DOWN, and RIGHT\n\nBetween these three safe moves:\n- **UP** (to (8, 5)): Opens up options, moves toward top-right area where apple (0, 9) is located\n- **DOWN** (to (8, 3)): Gets me closer to apples (4, 3) and (4, 1), but puts me closer to the enemy's path\n- **RIGHT** (to (9, 4)): Reaches the edge but limits my options (can only go UP, DOWN, or BACK LEFT)\n\n**Optimal move:**\nUP is the best choice. It keeps me on the less contested right side of the board, maintains flexibility with multiple follow-up directions, and positions me to potentially target the apple at (0, 9) or move toward other apples from a safer position. Moving to the edge (RIGHT) reduces future options unnecessarily.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nSecure the right side of the board and target apples away from the enemy's likely path. Consider moving toward (0, 9) in the top-left or maintaining flexibility to access (4, 1) and (0, 5) if opportunities arise. Avoid getting trapped in the corner.\n\nUP",

I\u2019ll plan to navigate along the top edge toward (8, 9) apple after this.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (0, 9), go RIGHT to (1, 9), then RIGHT to (2, 9), etc., heading toward (8, 9) apple while avoiding trapping myself.

Gets me very close to the apple at (2, 8) - just one step away\n2. **DOWN** - to (3, 7): **ELIMINATED** - This is occupied by my own body (neck)\n3. **RIGHT** - to (4, 8): Empty cell, safe move. Leads toward the apple cluster at (7, 8) and (8, 9)\n4. **LEFT** - to (2, 8): **APPLE!** - This is an apple cell at (2, 8). Safe move, would give me 8 apples\n\n**Strategic assessment:**\n- Snake #1's head is at (2, 9), just above me\n- The apple at (2, 8) is immediately to my LEFT - this is the closest apple!\n- Moving LEFT would tie me with snake #1 at 8 apples each\n- The top-right apples (7, 8) and (8, 9) are still valuable targets for future turns\n- I need to secure this nearby apple before snake #1 gets it\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**\n- Snake #1 at (2, 9) might move DOWN to (2, 8) to get that apple, or LEFT to (1, 9), or RIGHT to (3, 9), or stay in place\n- Snake #1 will likely move toward the apple at (2, 8) or continue securing territory\n\n**Best move:** LEFT to (2, 8) to grab the apple immediately. This:\n1. Gets me the closest apple\n2. Ties me with snake #1 at 8 apples\n3. Is a safe move (not into my body or off board)\n4. Keeps me in good position for future moves toward the top-right cluster\n\n**Future planning:** After getting this apple, I'll need to maneuver around the board to collect the remaining apples while avoiding snake #1. The goal is to reach the top-right apples (7, 8) and (8, 9) and potentially also get the apple at (0, 0) or (1, 1) during the journey.\n\nLEFT",

But rules: if both heads collide, both die \u2014 enemy might not care if tied apples? Actually enemy has 7, I have 8, so enemy dies and I win if I survive? Wait \u2014 head-on collision kills both, so enemy dies but so do I. So enemy might do it to force draw if they can\u2019t win? Possibly.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \n- DOWN to (2, 8): eat apple, grow. Next moves from (2, 8): UP (body), DOWN (2,7 empty), LEFT (1,8 body), RIGHT (3,8 enemy head now? Actually enemy moves same turn so can\u2019t predict exactly).  \n- RIGHT to (3, 9): no apple. Next moves from (3, 9): DOWN (3,8 enemy head? Again simultaneous move), LEFT (2,9 body), RIGHT (4,9 empty), UP off board invalid. So only RIGHT safe next turn if enemy stays at (3,8) or moves away.  \n\nDOWN gives growth but riskier due to apple incentive for enemy.  \nRIGHT less incentive for enemy but still possible collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Better choice:**  \nRIGHT seems slightly safer because enemy might go for apple at (2,8) or (7,8) instead of UP to (3,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 9), if enemy not adjacent, go RIGHT to (4,9) to open space. Avoid top edge trap.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",
