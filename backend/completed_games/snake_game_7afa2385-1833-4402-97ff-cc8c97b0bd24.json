Empty space\n- DOWN: (2, -1) - DEAD! Off the board\n- LEFT: (1, 0) - SAFE! Empty space\n- RIGHT: (3, 0) - SAFE! Empty space\n\nSo we've got 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. No immediate threats here.\n\nNow let's think strategically:\n- The enemy is all the way up at (5, 9) - pretty far from us\n- We've got apples at (7,0), (0,4), (7,6), (7,1), etc.\n- Since we're both at 0 apples, we need to start collecting ASAP\n\nMy move: **RIGHT**\n\nWhy RIGHT?\n1.

You asked for aggressive play and thinking out loud, so let\u2019s break it down. Ready? \ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick board read:\n- Our head: (5,9). Enemy head: (2,0). Both length 1 (no bodies to worry about yet).\n- Immediate apples of interest nearby: (6,8) is one step diagonal below-right from us \u2014 super reachable next turn.\n- Opponent is down in the bottom-left and can grab (1,0) or move up/right, but they\u2019re FAR from threatening a head-on this turn.\n\nMove-by-move check (rules: no suicides, avoid head collisions unless advantageous):\n- UP -> (5,10) = off-board = immediate DEATH. No way. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (4,9) = on-board, safe. Keeps options but doesn\u2019t approach the juicy apple at (6,8). \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (6,9) = on-board, safe. Also can access (6,8) next turn. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,8) = on-board, safe. From here we have multiple follow-ups (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN) and can go RIGHT next turn to (6,8) to grab the apple. \u2705\n\nWhy I pick DOWN (5,8) this turn:\n- It keeps the most flexible escape options (not funneling ourselves along the top edge). \u2705\n- It moves us closer to the apple at (6,8) while preserving routing choices to cut across and control the upper half. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Opponent is out of immediate contact \u2014 no need to risk a head-on. We\u2019ll grow on our terms and then pressure. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Next turn: from (5,8) go RIGHT to eat (6,8). Grow +1, gain control of that quadrant.\n- Then pivot to sweep left/right across row 8\u20139 to hem the enemy in as they advance, forcing them into our trap or into apples we control.\n- Avoid a head-on unless we\u2019re ahead on apples \u2014 we\u2019ll bait them into collisions after building a lead.\n\nFinal read: DOWN is safe, aggressive, and maximizes future options. Let\u2019s make him crash out! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Keeps top edge access but misses the immediate apple. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (4,8): safe, but drifts away from the apple and less aggressive. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,7): safe, keeps center options but also misses instant growth. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (6,8): contains an apple. Move there = immediate +1 apple and +1 length. Aggressive, safe this turn. \u2705\n\nEnemy (3,0) is far away and can\u2019t threaten our immediate cells this turn. No head-on risk if we take the apple at (6,8). Growing now gives us leverage to start boxing them in \u2014 we want to control space, not trade head-ons while apples are tied.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Grabs the apple instantly and forces the board-state advantage early \u2014 growth = more body to wall the opponent later. \ud83c\udf4e\n- Keeps multiple follow-ups (6,9), (7,8), (6,7) available next turn \u2014 we won\u2019t be cornering ourselves.\n- Opponent is too far to contest this cell, so it\u2019s a clean, aggressive play that sets up the trap.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Eat (6,8) this turn, then pivot to press the upper-right quadrant: use our new length to sweep rows 8\u20139 and start hemming the opponent toward the bottom-left apples.\n- Avoid head-on collisions until we\u2019re up on apples. Once we have a lead, bait them into a head-on or seal them in with our body.\n- Keep at least 2 escape options open each turn; don\u2019t let the tail get trapped against the wall.\n\nLet\u2019s snag that apple and start the choke hold.

We need to get aggressive and catch up!\n\nCurrent situation:\n- We're at (5, 2) - just moved UP from (5, 1)\n- Enemy snake is at (5, 6) with body at (6, 6)\n- They have 1 apple, we have 0 - we NEED to catch up!\n\nSafe moves check:\n- UP: (5, 3) - SAFE! Empty space\n- DOWN: (5, 1) - SAFE! Empty space\n- LEFT: (4, 2) - SAFE! Empty space\n- RIGHT: (6, 2) - SAFE! Empty space\n\nWe've got 4 safe moves again! That's what I'm talking about!\n\nStrategic thinking:\n- The enemy is at (5, 6) - directly above us, only 4 spaces away!\n- We're in the middle of the board with lots of options\n- Apple at (1, 0) is close to us on the left side\n- Apple at (7, 0) is on the right side, but we'd have to go down first\n\nHere's the play: We're going UP to (5, 3). Why?\n1. It keeps us moving toward the enemy who's directly above us\n2. It maintains our central position\n3. It gives us options to go LEFT toward apples or RIGHT to pressure the enemy\n4. It avoids any potential head-on collisions - we need to be smart about this!\n\nLong-term plan:\n1. Go UP to (5, 3) to keep building height and pressure\n2. Next turn, likely go UP again to (5, 4) to keep building height\n3. Once we're at y=4 or y=5, we'll decide: LEFT toward apples or RIGHT to pressure the enemy\n4. The goal is to control the center and force the enemy to come to us\n\nRemember chat: we want to box him in! Stay aggressive, stay smart, and let's catch up on those apples!\n\nUP",

Do not do that.\n\nConsider all moves:\n- UP -> (5,7): safe, but moves away from the opponent and wastes pressure. \u274c (not preferred)\n- DOWN -> (5,5): safe, moves us closer to the enemy at (5,2), keeps us in column x=5 to herd him downward. \u2705 (aggressive, maintains leverage)\n- LEFT -> (4,6): safe, could start a flank to cut left escapes, but reduces immediate vertical pressure. \u274c (less direct)\n- RIGHT -> (6,6): illegal (back into our neck). \u274c\n\nTactical read:\n- We already share the same x (5) with the opponent (5,2). That\u2019s huge \u2014 staying in column 5 keeps him squeezed vertically.\n- We have the apple lead (1\u20130). If needed, a head-on double KO still gives us the win on apples, but we should first try to force him into a trap while staying alive.\n- Moving DOWN tightens the noose: we close distance quickly, limit his vertical room, and keep options to pivot left/right to cut his lateral escapes next turn depending on his move.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN this turn to (5,5).\n- If he tries to go sideways, pivot LEFT or RIGHT to block that escape and then cut him off toward the bottom edge.\n- If he moves UP to avoid, continue descending and either force a head-on when favorable or outmaneuver him for a clean kill/gain of more apples.\n- Only take apples if they help control the board or secure a decisive advantage.\n\nLocking it in \u2014 pressure and aggression.
