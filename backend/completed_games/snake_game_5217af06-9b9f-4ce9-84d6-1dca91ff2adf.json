The enemy snake (0) is at (0, 0).\n\nMy previous plan to go to (2, 8) has to be reconsidered. I executed RIGHT, UP, UP, and LEFT. This caused my head to move from (3,6) to (4,6) to (4,7) to (4,8) to (3,8). \n\nNow my snake's head is at (3, 8).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the apples. (2,8) is directly to the left. (1,7) is still too close to the enemy. (0,6) is quite far. (0,8) is possible. (6,3) is the furthest. Taking (2,8) seems like the best plan.\n\nLet's go LEFT!\n\nLEFT",
