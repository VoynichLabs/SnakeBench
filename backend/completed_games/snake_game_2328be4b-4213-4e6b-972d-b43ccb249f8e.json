By moving RIGHT, our head will land at (2,7), which aligns us in the target column. From there, we can plan to move DOWN to (2,6) and then toward the apple at (2,5).\n\nLet\u2019s briefly check each option:  \n\u2022 LEFT moves us further from the cluster (our distance to, say, (2,5) would increase).  \n\u2022 DOWN to (1,6) is safe but leaves us off the main apple column and would require an extra lateral move to align with (2,5).\n\nThus, by moving RIGHT we directly approach the apple area without unnecessary detours. I\u2019ll also plan next turn to move DOWN from (2,7) toward the apple at (2,5).\n\nNext move: RIGHT."
