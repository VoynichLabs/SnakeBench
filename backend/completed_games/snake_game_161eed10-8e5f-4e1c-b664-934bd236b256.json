My snake is currently at position (5, 9), and the enemy snake is at position (9, 7).\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 5), which is a straight down move from my current position. However, moving down would bring me closer to the enemy snake, which I want to avoid.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (7, 4), which is a diagonal move. This could be a good option, as it would put some distance between me and the enemy snake.\n\nAnother option is to move up to (5, 9), which would put me closer to the apple at (6, 9). This could be a good strategy, as it would allow me to collect that apple and potentially move away from the enemy snake.\n\nOverall, I think the best move for me right now is to go UP. This will put me closer to the apple at (6, 9) and keep me a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move is: UP."
