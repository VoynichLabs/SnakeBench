Nearest apple looks like (6, 2), which requires moving RIGHT and then DOWN\n2. I'm currently at the left edge of the board at y=6\n3. Enemy snake #2 is at (8, 1), which isn't immediately threatening\n4. I want to avoid getting trapped or cornered\n\nReasoning for Move:\n- Will move RIGHT to start approaching the (6, 2) apple\n- This gives me a clear path without risk of immediate collision\n- Provides flexibility for future moves\n\nNext Strategy Reminder: After this move, continue navigating towards (6, 2) apple while keeping escape routes open.\n\nNext Move: RIGHT"
