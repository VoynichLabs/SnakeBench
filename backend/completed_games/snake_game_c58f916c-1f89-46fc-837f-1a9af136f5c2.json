Me at (0,3), fresh as a daisy, zero apples, zero body \u2013 but I've got that hunger for domination! Archrival at (9,9), same pitiful start, but we're about to turn this into a bloodbath! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst off, let's break down the moves: RIGHT to (1,3), UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2). LEFT? Pfft, that's asking to yeet myself off the board like a total noob \u2013 ELIMINATED! Ain't nobody got time for that rookie mistake. We're alive and kicking, all options safe. No bodies in the way yet, no walls, no ramming into each other this turn \u2013 we're miles apart. But oh boy, scores tied at zero, so no head-on baiting yet. Gotta build up those apples first, grow long and menacing to corner this sucker!\n\nWhy prioritize? Chat, you know I love aggressive plays \u2013 let's not crawl sideways like a chump. Moving UP to (0,4) keeps me near the edge, but eyes on the enemy \u2013 he's crouched in the top-right corner, probably eyeing his own grub. DOWN to (0,2) heads into apple territory on row 2 (look at those A's!), but might hem me in against the bottom wall later. RIGHT to (1,3) is middle ground, opening up the board, giving me wiggle room for future ambushes and apple grabs. It doesn't box me in yet, and the body's empty so follow-ups are gold \u2013 I could pivot left or right later without painting myself into a corner! Plus, by going RIGHT, I'm subtly advancing towards the center, where the real battles happen. LEFT is dead, so RIGHT feels like the smart bully move: fresh options, potential growth, and no dead ends looming.\n\nLong-term strat for my future self (listen up, past Streamer!): Lock eyes on enemy position, aim to loop around and force him into my territory as we grow. Score parity means no fast head-ons yet \u2013 eat apples aggressively but keep space to trap him. If he goes defensive, bait with openings. Crush him by turn 50 or bust! Dominate that scoreboard, chat!\n\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's break this down! \ud83d\ude24 We're starting at (9,9) top-right corner, enemy snake at (0,3) bottom-left. Both of us have no body yet, so no immediate danger from ourselves.\n\nFirst turn, we gotta move smart. Let's check all four moves:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,10) \u274c off the board \u2192 DEAD.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,8) \u2705 inside board, no body there, no enemy body there. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,9) \u2705 safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (10,9) \u274c off board.\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, apples are scattered, but enemy is far away. We want to control space and not get trapped later. From (9,9):\n\n- DOWN to (9,8): puts us near apple at (9,8) actually \u2014 wait, board shows 'A' at (9,8)? Yes! Apple at (9,8)! That means if we go DOWN, we eat an apple turn 1, grow to length 2, score 1. That's content! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT to (8,9): no apple there.\n\nGoing DOWN gets us an immediate apple, but then our body will be at (9,9) next turn. That's fine. Enemy is at (0,3), far away, no threat of head-on collision this turn.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if we eat apple, we grow, which means we take up more space, can start boxing enemy earlier. That's good.\n\nAlso, going DOWN leaves us with possible moves next turn from (9,8): UP (back to (9,9) which will be our body \u2014 not safe unless we have other options), LEFT (8,8), RIGHT (off board), DOWN (9,7). So two safe moves likely next turn (LEFT and DOWN). That's okay.\n\nGoing LEFT to (8,9) gives next turn options: UP (8,10 off), DOWN (8,8), LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9 empty now). So three safe moves next turn.\n\nBut eating apple early gives us length advantage for head-on collisions later. Since enemy length is 1 too, if we eat now, we'll be length 2 vs length 1 \u2014 if we meet head-on next turn, we win. That's huge.\n\nSo I'm thinking: take the apple, get bigger, start controlling board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for next turn):** After eating apple at (9,8), we'll have body at (9,9), head at (9,8). Next turn, avoid going back into (9,9). Move towards center to cut off enemy's expansion. Enemy at (0,3) likely will go for apple at (0,2) or (2,1). We should gradually move left/down to dominate middle.\n\nAlright chat, the move is clear \u2014 let's grab that apple and start snowballing! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca8\n\nDOWN",

That means if we meet head-on next turn, WE WIN. Let\u2019s use that advantage aggressively.\n\nCheck moves from (9,8):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,9) \u274c That\u2019s our own body \u2014 DEAD.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (10,8) \u274c Off board.\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\nNow think about enemy movement: They\u2019re at (1,3). Likely going for apple at (0,2) or (2,1) or (3,2). They could also move toward center. We want to cut them off early.\n\nIf we go **LEFT** to (8,8):  \n- Next turn options: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8 \u2014 but that\u2019s our old head position, empty now). Good flexibility.  \n- But we stay far from enemy.\n\nIf we go **DOWN** to (9,7):  \n- Next turn options: UP (9,8 \u2014 empty), DOWN (9,6), LEFT (8,7). Still okay.  \n- Puts us closer to apple at (9,8)? Wait, we just left (9,8), no apple there now. Apple at (9,8) was eaten last turn.  \n- Actually looking at board: Apple at (7,8) is near us \u2014 if we go LEFT then DOWN next turn, maybe we can grab it.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 we want to BOX THE ENEMY. They\u2019re in bottom-left. We should move toward center-left to cut off their expansion. Going LEFT to (8,8) is a step toward center. Going DOWN to (9,7) keeps us on right edge \u2014 less aggressive.\n\nAlso, with our length advantage, we can afford to be more aggressive. If enemy moves toward (2,3) or (1,4), we can start moving left-down to trap them against wall.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move toward (7,8) apple while positioning to cut off enemy\u2019s path to right side. Next turn from (8,8), maybe go LEFT or DOWN to get closer to center. Force enemy toward top-left corner.\n\nChat, I think LEFT is the move \u2014 it opens more future options and starts our domination march across the board. Let\u2019s go! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Our archrival at (9,8) with his pitiful body at (9,9) and that smug 1 apple lead? Pfft, he's about to get BURIED! We're miles apart for now, no immediate head-on danger, but I gotta close that score gap fast or bait his weak ass into crashing me. Scores: him 1-0, no head-ons off rip. Time to grow, box him in, and make him weep! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLet's rip through these moves like a boss: RIGHT to (2,3), LEFT to (0,3), UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2). All safe? Damn right \u2013 no walls, no bodies (mine or his, he's trapped in his corner playground), no ramming into each other yet. But safety ain't victory, fam! We're snarling for the throat!\n\nDitch the chump moves first: LEFT to (0,3)? Puts me hugging the left edge, opening SUPER limited doors \u2013 triangulate this: UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2) for a quick apple nibble at (0,2), RIGHT back to restart. Only THREE real options, and I'm flirting with dead ends if I hug that wall too long. Rookie trap, chat! No ways! DOWN to (1,2)? Yeah, drops me into apple heaven \u2013 RIGHT or LEFT to snatch (2,2) or (0,2) EASY, UP back if I funk it up. But oh no, those bottom ranks (rows 0-2) are apple-packed but DEATH TRAPS! If I slither there, the board hems me in like a garbage disposal, limiting my bully runs and letting him snake around my blind spots. And that scoreboard? I'm bottom feeder at 0, he at 1 \u2013 why risk getting boxed in and hand him the easy win? Nope, that's for amateurs who cry \"oopsie\" in the chat!\n\nSo winners: RIGHT to (2,3) \u2013 keeps the board wide open, yanking me center-ish with PLENTY of wiggle: UP to (2,4), DOWN back if needed, RIGHT to (3,3) for more expansion, LEFT all the way. No tight spots for 5-10 turns easy, and I'm poaching neutral ground away from his top-right junkyard. Perfect for stalking his next slithery mistake! UP to (1,4)? OH, the temptation \u2013 straight towards the center, eye on distant grub like (6,4) at (6,4), and four DIRECTIONS open AF: RIGHT eastward domination, LEFT boundary push, DOWN retreat-hit, UP farther out. It's pureamaniac freedom, avoiding Mr. Wall's lurking doom, and positioning me to loop around his ass as we grow. This shouts \"AGGRESSOR ALERT\" \u2013 I'm advancing subtly north, ready to flank if he dares hit the open field. Scores? Equal power now means keep distance, grow your empire, then RAM if I surge ahead! No dead ends, tons of future trap setups, and I'm creeping on his turf vibe. This is the MOVE to bully the board!\n\nWhy not RIGHT? It's good, chat, but UP disrupts his presumed comfort zone better \u2013 he's holed up top-right, probably playing scared, and I'm volunteering for the top-row takeover? HELL YES! Long-run vision: Time to EAT apples voraciously (rows 4-6 got that (6,4), (4,7) goodness), catch his score by turn 10, and force him into walls or my body. If he dives, cut off his paths; if he retreats, flood the board. Dominate the scoreboard, make him rue being the favorite!\n\nUP",

We have length 2, they have length 1 \u2014 so head-on collision means WE WIN if we meet next turn! Let\u2019s push that advantage.\n\nCheck moves from (8,8):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,9) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,8) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,8) \u274c That\u2019s our own body \u2014 DEAD.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow think about enemy movement: They\u2019re at (1,4). They can go UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4). They might go for apple at (0,2) or (2,1) or (3,2) or (2,2). But they\u2019re short \u2014 they might play safe or go for food.\n\nWe want to BOX THEM EARLY. If we move LEFT to (7,8), we\u2019re closer to center but still far. If we move DOWN to (8,7), we\u2019re moving toward bottom-right apples but away from enemy. If we move UP to (8,9), we\u2019re going toward top edge \u2014 maybe less aggressive.\n\nBut wait \u2014 look at the board! Apple at (7,8) is RIGHT NEXT to us! If we go LEFT to (7,8), we EAT an apple, grow to length 3, and increase our lead to 2 apples vs 0. That\u2019s HUGE for early dominance. Plus, eating that apple removes it from board, denying enemy potential food.\n\nGoing LEFT also puts us closer to cutting off enemy\u2019s path to the right side. From (7,8) next turn, we can go DOWN/LEFT/UP to control more space.\n\nIf we go UP or DOWN, we miss the immediate apple and give enemy time to grow.\n\nChat, this is a no-brainer \u2014 we go for the apple, grow our lead, and position to dominate. Let\u2019s eat and pressure! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We're at (1,4) with zero body, lean as a boss, while that scrub enemy lounges at (8,8) with his puny tail at (9,8) and a measly 1 apple? Pfft, he's begging for a reality check \u2013 we're about to turn this score gap into his gravesite! Apples littering the floor like easy prey, but focus on the enemy, grow like a beast, box his ass in and make him crash out! Scores tied zero when we ate nothing yet, but we'll rocket past him, force head-ons on our terms. Who's ready to dominate? LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, all four moves \u2013 UP to (1,5), DOWN to (1,3), LEFT to (0,4), RIGHT to (2,4) \u2013 safe on immediate hits? HELL YEAH, no walls, no bodies (ours or his remote junk), no ramming ourselves. But we ain't settling for alive \u2013 we want OPEN options, path to chow down, and no dumb traps!\n\nLEFT to (0,4) is a straight-up radio silence \u2013 hugs the wall like a rookie, netting only 3 next moves (RIGHT back, UP, DOWN), dead-end whispering \"you're boxed!\" Why flop into limited land and let him flank around? DOWN to (1,3) drops us lower, flirting with those bottom apple clusters ((2,2), (3,2)), but last clip called it a DEATH TRAP \u2013 hems in like a vice, gives him free reign to snake our blind fields, no bully room! Scores zero-zero soon, why risk handing him the easy win loop? Too amateur, chat \u2013 we OWN the center and top, not pit ourselves!\n\nSo, winners: RIGHT to (2,4) keeps boards wide, 4 slick follow-ups, poaching neutral mid-ground for expansion domination \u2013 head towards juicy grub like (3,6) in 3 moves via UP-UP-RIGHT, eat fast, climb score, box potential! But we're archrival crushers, not fence-sitters. UP to (1,5) screams AGGRESSOR OF THE CENTURY \u2013 north push disrupts his cozy top-right hideout, flanks like a dagger, leads to those row7 apples ((4,7),(7,6)), keeps tons of wiggle (RIGHT to (2,5), LEFT, DOWN, UP farther), grow empire leg up! Heads east to neutral, but UP hits his turf, forces him scared retreat or crash bait. Long game? Catch his score by snag, flood the top rows, make him regret existing \u2013 then RAM if we surge to 2-1! Hell yes, the bully advance is on, no dead ends, pure future traps! RIGHT's good expansion, but UP's the disruptor to bury him. LET'S DO THIS!\n\nPlan for next turns: Keep north push, hit top apples for fast growth, loop west if he dips, aim to lead 2-1 by turn 6-7, then position for head-on slam if he scrambles. If he gangs apples, shift east to counter-box. Grow, grow, GROW \u2013 turn him into roadkill! \ud83c\udf74\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc7b\n\nUP",

If we move UP to (7,9), we're going to top edge \u2014 less aggressive.\n\nBut think long-term: We want to CONTROL the board. Moving DOWN to (7,7) puts us closer to multiple apples AND positions us to cut off the bottom-right quadrant. From (7,7), next turn we could go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (if tail moves) to pressure.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6,8) is okay but moves us away from immediate apple clusters. UP to (7,9) is a bit cornering.\n\nChat, I'm thinking DOWN to (7,7) \u2014 it's safe, keeps options open (UP, LEFT, DOWN next turn), and sets up for apple at (7,7) or (7,6) next turn! Grow that lead, deny them resources! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving to (7,7), assess if we can eat (7,7) apple, otherwise continue cutting off enemy's path to the right side.

We have a 3-apple lead \u2014 DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Enemy snake #0 is still length 1 at (1,6), desperate for food. We need to keep the pressure ON and box them in!\n\nFirst, check immediate moves from (7,7):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7,8) \u274c That's our own body segment \u2014 DEAD.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,6) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,7) \u2705 Empty, safe.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nEnemy at (1,6) can go UP (1,7) \u2014 apple there! DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6) \u2014 apple there too!, RIGHT (2,6). They're gonna go for an apple, probably (1,7) or (0,6). They're short, so they need to eat ASAP.\n\nOur goal: CUT THEM OFF from expanding toward the right side. If they get longer, they become a threat. Right now we can be aggressive because we're longer \u2014 head-on collision would kill them, not us! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's evaluate:\n\n- **DOWN to (7,6)**: Puts us on an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Immediate growth to length 4, extends our lead. Also positions us to move toward center or left next turn. Safe follow-ups? From (7,6): UP (back to body \u2014 risky next turn unless tail moves), DOWN (7,5) empty, LEFT (6,6) empty, RIGHT (8,6) empty. Tail at (9,8) will move forward if we eat, so our body will shift. Good options.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,7)**: No apple. Moves us closer to enemy's side, could intercept them if they try to cross mid-board. But we miss immediate growth. From (6,7): UP (6,8) \u2014 our body now? Actually after tail moves, (6,8) might be free? Wait, our body is [(7,8),(8,8),(9,8)], tail at (9,8). If we move LEFT and don't eat, tail stays, so (6,8) is free. DOWN (6,6) free, RIGHT back to (7,7) free, LEFT (5,7) free. Okay.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: No apple. Moves us toward right edge \u2014 less aggressive, more defensive. From (8,7): UP (8,8) \u2014 that's our body segment now, so next turn it might be free if tail moves? Actually if we don't eat, tail stays, so (8,8) is occupied. So UP not safe next turn unless we eat now. DOWN (8,6) free, LEFT back to (7,7) free, RIGHT (9,7) free.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to CONTROL the center and left side, forcing enemy into a corner. Eating the apple at (7,6) grows our lead to 4 apples vs 0 \u2014 HUGE! Then next turn, we can push left toward (6,6) or (5,6) to cut off enemy's path to the bottom-right apple cluster.\n\nIf enemy goes for (1,7) apple, they'll be at (1,7) next turn, length 2. We can then move to intercept from the south or east.\n\nChat, I think the move is **DOWN** \u2014 secure the apple, grow the lead, maintain momentum! \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4e After eating, our tail moves to (8,8), body becomes [(7,6),(7,7),(7,8),(8,8)] \u2014 nice compact shape on right side, ready to strike left.\n\nWatch for enemy possibly moving toward (0,6) apple \u2014 if they do, they'll be near left edge, easier to trap later.\n\nDOWN",

We have a HUGE length advantage \u2014 if we collide head-on, WE WIN. Let\u2019s use that!\n\nFirst, check our possible moves from (6,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 That\u2019s our own body segment at (7,7)? Wait, no \u2014 (6,7) is empty on the board! Let\u2019s verify: Board shows row 7: . T 0 . A . . T . . \u2014 so (6,7) is empty. Actually our body is at (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,8). So (6,7) is safe. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,5) \u2014 Empty. \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 Empty. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 That\u2019s our own body segment! \u274c DEAD.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy at (2,7) can move UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). All except DOWN (into their own body at (1,7)? Wait, their body is at (1,7) \u2014 so DOWN to (2,6) is safe actually. Their body list is [(1,7)] so tail is at (1,7). So they can move DOWN to (2,6) safely (tail might move away after they move). So all 4 directions possible for them.\n\nOur goal: trap them in top-left corner. They might go for apple at (0,6) or (0,9). If they move LEFT to (1,7) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body currently, but after they move, tail moves? Actually simultaneous move \u2014 if they move LEFT into (1,7), that\u2019s currently occupied by their body, so they die. So they won\u2019t choose LEFT. So their safe moves: UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6), RIGHT (3,7).\n\nWe want to cut off their escape to the right and down. From (6,6), moving LEFT to (5,6) gets us closer to block their rightward expansion. Moving UP to (6,7) gets us closer to top where they are, but maybe too direct? Moving DOWN to (6,5) moves us away from them \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,6), next turn we could go further LEFT toward (4,6) or UP to (5,7) to intercept if they move right. If they go RIGHT this turn to (3,7), then we\u2019re in good position to meet them next turn with our longer body.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,7), we\u2019re closer but might risk head-on if they go DOWN to (2,6) \u2014 no, that\u2019s far. Actually head-on only if same cell. Could we force head-on? With length advantage, yes \u2014 but we need to predict their move. They might avoid us.\n\nBetter plan: Move LEFT to (5,6), then next turn move UP to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,6) to cut off their access to center. Keep them trapped near left wall.\n\nAlso, apple at (5,2) is far down, not priority. Apple at (4,4) is closer but not worth chasing now \u2014 focus on enemy containment.\n\nChat, we\u2019re going for the BOX-IN strategy! Let\u2019s push left and up next turn to squeeze them! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

We have a HUGE length advantage \u2014 if we collide head-on, WE WIN. Let\u2019s force the issue!\n\nFirst, check our safe moves from (5,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,7) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,5) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,6) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 That\u2019s our own body segment at (6,6) from last turn! \u274c DEAD.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy at (3,7) \u2014 their body is at (2,7). Their possible moves:  \nUP (3,8), DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body currently, so they die if they go LEFT. \u274c  \nRIGHT (4,7) \u2014 apple there! They might go for it.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nWe want to cut off their escape and force a head-on collision while we\u2019re longer.  \nIf we go UP to (5,7), we\u2019re closer to them but still 2 away.  \nIf we go LEFT to (4,6), we block their path down/center.  \nIf we go DOWN to (5,5), we move away \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nBut think: If enemy goes RIGHT to (4,7) (apple), and we go UP to (5,7), next turn we could go RIGHT to (6,7) or LEFT to (4,7) to meet them.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3,6), we go UP to (5,7) \u2014 still not colliding this turn.\n\nActually, what if we go LEFT to (4,6)? That puts us directly below (4,7) \u2014 if enemy goes RIGHT to (4,7), we\u2019re adjacent below them. Next turn we could go UP into them if they stay, forcing head-on with length advantage.\n\nBut wait \u2014 simultaneous moves: If enemy goes RIGHT to (4,7) and we go LEFT to (4,6), no collision this turn. Next turn we could go UP to (4,7) if they\u2019re still there, but they might move.\n\nBetter: Go UP to (5,7). That puts us closer to their possible UP move (3,8) and also closer to cut off right side. Then next turn, if they\u2019re at (4,7), we go LEFT to (4,7) for head-on win.\n\nWe need to be aggressive \u2014 length 5 vs 2, we want that head-on!  \nUP sets up better board control toward top-left where they are.\n\nAlso, think about future safe moves from (5,7):  \nUP (5,8) empty, DOWN back to (5,6) is body? Wait, (5,6) will be empty after we move (tail at (7,8) stays). Actually our body after moving UP: new head (5,7), then (5,6) old head, (6,6), (7,6), (7,7), tail (7,8). So (5,6) is our neck \u2014 can\u2019t go back DOWN next turn (backwards into body). So from (5,7), safe moves next turn would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nThat\u2019s fine \u2014 keeps options open.\n\nLEFT to (4,6) also fine, but maybe less direct pressure.\n\nChat, we\u2019re going UP to press into their space and set up the kill box! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nWe\u2019re at (5,7) after this move. Enemy likely at (4,7) if they go for apple, or (3,8)/(3,6). If they\u2019re at (4,7), next turn we go LEFT into them for head-on win. If they\u2019re elsewhere, we continue cutting off their board space. Avoid getting trapped near top wall \u2014 keep left/right options open.\n\nUP",

We have length 5 vs their length 2 \u2014 massive advantage! If we force a head-on collision, WE WIN. Let's analyze.\n\nFirst, check our safe moves from (5,7):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 That's our own body segment (neck)! \u274c DEAD (backwards into body).  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, enemy at (3,6). Their body: [(3,7), (2,7)]. Their possible moves:  \nUP (3,7) \u2014 That's their own body! \u274c  \nDOWN (3,5) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \nLEFT (2,6) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \nRIGHT (4,6) \u2014 Empty. \u2705  \n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWe want to cut off their escape and force a collision. If we go LEFT to (4,7), we're directly above (4,6) \u2014 if they go RIGHT to (4,6), we're adjacent vertically. Next turn we could go DOWN into them if they stay.  \nIf we go UP to (5,8), we move away \u2014 less pressure.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (6,7), we move farther away \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nBut think: They might go for apples? Closest apple to them is at (4,4) or (3,3) \u2014 they might move DOWN/LEFT. If they go DOWN to (3,5), we lose contact.\n\nActually, BEST MOVE: LEFT to (4,7). This blocks them from moving UP (already blocked by their body) and positions us to threaten DOWN next turn into (4,6) if they go there. It also keeps us close to their possible RIGHT move.\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (4,6) this turn, and we go LEFT to (4,7), next turn we can go DOWN to (4,6) for a head-on collision \u2014 WE WIN because we're longer! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nIf they go LEFT to (2,6) or DOWN to (3,5), we still have board control and can chase.\n\nAlso, from (4,7), our safe moves next turn would be UP (4,8), LEFT (3,7) \u2014 wait, (3,7) is enemy body, so that's safe for us (not our body), RIGHT (5,7) \u2014 our old head? Actually after moving, our body will be: new head (4,7), then (5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), tail (7,7). So (5,7) will be our neck \u2014 can't go RIGHT next turn (backwards). So from (4,7), safe next moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN. That's fine.\n\nGoing LEFT also avoids potential trap near top wall later.\n\nChat, we're going LEFT to press the attack and set up the HEAD-ON KILL next turn! Let's box him in! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nWe'll be at (4,7). If enemy is at (4,6), go DOWN into them for instant win. If enemy is elsewhere, continue cutting off their space, maybe go DOWN/LEFT to chase. Avoid moving into dead ends. Keep length advantage!\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's review the board state after that last move! \ud83d\ude24 We moved LEFT to (4,7) as planned. Now it's turn 9!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- Our head: (4,7)\n- Our body: [(5,7), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7)] \u2014 length 6 (5 apples + 1)\n- Enemy head: (4,6) \u2014 OHHH they moved RIGHT into (4,6) just like we predicted! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Enemy body: [(3,6), (3,7)] \u2014 length 3 (2 apples + 1)\n- We have a length advantage: 6 vs 3.\n\n**IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITY:**  \nWe are directly ABOVE them at (4,7). They are at (4,6). If we move DOWN this turn, we go to (4,6) \u2014 that's a head-on collision! But wait, they will also move simultaneously. We need to predict where they might go.\n\n**Enemy's possible moves from (4,6):**\n- UP to (4,7) \u2014 that's our current head position, but we're moving away? Actually if we move DOWN and they move UP, we swap positions \u2014 no collision.\n- DOWN to (4,5) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT to (3,6) \u2014 their own body segment (neck) \u2014 \u274c NOT ALLOWED (backwards into themselves).\n- RIGHT to (5,6) \u2014 our body segment (our 3rd segment) \u2014 \u274c That would kill them if they go there (they'd crash into us).\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\n**Our possible moves from (4,7):**\n- UP to (4,8) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (4,6) \u2014 currently occupied by enemy head.\n- LEFT to (3,7) \u2014 enemy body (tail) \u2014 safe for us (not our body).\n- RIGHT to (5,7) \u2014 our own neck \u2014 \u274c NOT ALLOWED (backwards into ourselves).\n\nSo our safe moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4,6):\n- If enemy goes UP to (4,7), we swap \u2014 no collision, we end at (4,6), they end at (4,7).\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (4,5), we move into (4,6) which becomes empty \u2014 safe.\n- If enemy goes LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 they die instantly (into body). So they won't.\nSo DOWN is safe for us regardless! And if they go UP, we avoid collision. If they go DOWN, we avoid collision. No risk of head-on? Wait \u2014 head-on collision only if both heads go to same cell. If we go DOWN to (4,6) and they go UP to (4,7), different cells \u2014 no collision. So DOWN is safe.\n\nBut chat \u2014 is that aggressive enough? We want to force a kill! If we go DOWN and they go UP, we're now below them \u2014 we lose adjacency. Hmm.\n\nWhat if we go LEFT to (3,7)? That's enemy tail \u2014 safe. Then we're positioned to maybe cut off their escape next turn. But less direct threat.\n\nWhat if we go UP to (4,8)? That's moving away \u2014 gives them space.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:**  \nWe have length advantage. Head-on collision would kill both if same length? No \u2014 if lengths are different, the longer snake wins! We have 6 vs 3 \u2014 so if we cause a head-on collision, WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nHow to force that? We need to go to a cell they will also go to. Their only safe moves are UP and DOWN. Our DOWN is (4,6). Their UP is (4,7). Their DOWN is (4,5). Our UP is (4,8). No overlap.\n\nSo we can't force a head-on this turn. But we can set up for next turn.\n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nGo DOWN to (4,6). Why?  \n- It's safe.  \n- It puts our head adjacent to theirs if they go UP (they'd be at (4,7), we at (4,6)).  \n- If they go DOWN to (4,5), we're at (4,6) \u2014 still adjacent vertically.  \nEither way, next turn we could potentially move into their head if they stay adjacent.\n\nAlso, going DOWN keeps us central and doesn't box us in. LEFT to (3,7) is near the wall \u2014 limits future moves.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nKeep pressure! Use our length to cut off their movement options. They only have 2 safe moves each turn if we stay close. Eventually trap them against a wall or our body. Avoid letting them get apples and grow. We have a big lead \u2014 play safe but aggressive!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**  \nDOWN \u2014 takes the center, stays safe, maintains adjacency for possible future kill.\n\nDOWN",
