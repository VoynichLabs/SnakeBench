The bottom row currently holds my tail but it will continue to advance as I move, so heading east avoids getting pinned against my own body on the left side.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue east toward (9,2)/(9,0).

The top area around (6,7) appears free of immediate threats.\n\n- Strategy: Prioritize moves that yield apples when safe and keep escape options open. RIGHT gives an immediate apple and maintains options for future moves.\n\nPlan:\n- Eat the apple by moving RIGHT to (6,7).

If the space around the head tightens, prioritize escaping to the right and down-left corridors to maintain multiple escape options.\n\nDOWN",

Not safe.\n- RIGHT is illegal because it would move onto your neck at (9,4).\n- LEFT looks possible, but the path toward apples on (5,4) and (4,4) is blocked by the enemy body at (6,4), and turning left could trap you behind a dense barrier with few safe detours.\n- DOWN is safe: (8,3) is empty, and moving down keeps multiple escape routes open (there are safe options to move to (8,2), (9,3), or (7,3) in subsequent turns). It also preserves the possibility to swing toward distant apples if a path clears.\n\nPlan:\n- Move DOWN to (8,3) now.\n- In subsequent turns, reassess: if a clear route opens toward the nearby apples (4,4) or (5,4) or toward the apple at (9,7), head that way while avoiding the enemy barrier. If not, continue exploring safe corridors (e.g., around the right edge) and avoid getting boxed in by the enemy body.\n\nDOWN",

The edge also reduces the chance of getting boxed in quickly, and there’s no obvious head-on risk this turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT to advance toward the apple at (9,7). After reaching (9,2), consider continuing UP to (9,3), then (9,4), aiming for the apple on (9,7) while staying mindful of enemy movement and avoiding turning back into your own neck.

Eating those two apples in a row would prevent the tail from moving and leave me boxed in by my own body with no escape on the following turn — effectively a forced suicide sequence.\n- LEFT -> (2,4) is free. It doesn't immediately grab an apple, but it keeps me alive and gives at least one safe follow-up (down to 2,3) while allowing my tail to advance in subsequent turns so I can avoid getting trapped.\n\nRisk assessment and choice:\n- RIGHT is tempting for immediate score but leads to an unavoidable trap and death soon after; avoid.\n- LEFT is the only safe, non-suicidal option that keeps future options open.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move LEFT to (2,4).

There’s little immediate safe routing available toward other apples without risking self-collision or getting boxed in. Downward retreat to (9,1) would move you away from all apples and could also lead to confinement.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (9,3) this turn to maintain progress toward the far apple. After that, reassess options; if the path becomes too constrained, pivot to safer routes that preserve escape space and look for nearby apples like (5,4) or (4,4) only if a safe detour becomes available.\n\nUP",
