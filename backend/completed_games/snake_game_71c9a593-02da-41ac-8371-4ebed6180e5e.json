No thanks. \u274c  \n3) UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all immediately safe (no bodies or apples blocking). \u2705\n\nShort evaluation of the three safe moves:\n- UP (0,9): safe but pins us to the top edge \u2014 fewer lateral options next turn. Edge-play limits escape routes.  \n- DOWN (0,7): keeps us on left edge, closer to apple at (0,5) but still two moves away; also fewer options than moving inward.  \n- RIGHT (1,8): moves us toward the nearby apple at (2,8), opens up 3-way freedom next turn (up/down/right), gives best mobility to maneuver around the rival.\n\nOpponent (head at 3,5) is not adjacent to any of our immediate target squares, so head-on collision this turn is extremely unlikely. We both have 0 apples \u2014 no reason to suicidal-head-on. We want to grow on our terms and then force him into a choke later.\n\nPlan for next turns (brief): push RIGHT to grab the apple at (2,8), expand toward center, then use superior board control to flank the enemy. Avoid getting stuck on the left edge \u2014 take the center route and threaten to cut him off near y=5\u20136.\n\nLet's get that positional advantage and box him in \u2014 MOVE NOW:\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's break it down chat! \ud83d\udd25 We're on turn 0/150, both snakes are fresh with 0 apples. My head is at (3,5), enemy head is at (0,8). We're playing Snake on a 10x10 board. The objective is to dominate and be aggressive! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFirst, check for immediate threats: The enemy is at (0,8) - way up top left. I'm at (3,5). Neither of us has a body (just heads). So no self-collision or immediate body threats.\n\nNow consider moves:\n\n**RIGHT** to (4,5): Safe? Let's see. Board state shows (4,5) is empty (row 5: \"A . . 0 . . A . . .\" - positions: (0,5)=A, (1,5)=., (2,5)=., (3,5)=0, (4,5)=., etc). So empty. No body. Also no apple immediately, but there's an apple at (7,3) and (6,5) etc. Moving right opens up more paths. But need to think about enemy movement. Enemy at (0,8) could move right to (1,8) or up to (0,9) or down to (0,7) or left? left would be (-1,8) off board - illegal. So enemy likely will move into board. We'll think about collision later.\n\n**UP** to (3,6): Check (3,6) - row 6: \" . . . . A . . A A A \" - positions: (0,6)=., (1,6)=., (2,6)=., (3,6)=., (4,6)=A, (5,6)=., (6,6)=., (7,6)=A, (8,6)=A, (9,6)=A. So (3,6) is empty. Safe.\n\n**DOWN** to (3,4): Row 4: \" . . . . . . . . . . \" - all empty. Safe.\n\n**LEFT** to (2,5): Row 5: positions (2,5) is empty (since (0,5)=A, (1,5)=., (2,5)=., etc). Safe.\n\nAll four directions are safe from immediate collision (no board edge, no body). So all are viable.\n\nNow consider long-term: We need to box in the enemy and force a crash. The enemy is at (0,8), near the top-left corner. That's a vulnerable position - they have limited moves (only down, right, or up if not at top). Actually y=8, top is y=9, so up to (0,9) is possible. Left is off board. So enemy has at most 3 moves.\n\nOur head at (3,5) is more central. We can try to move towards the enemy to cut off their escape routes. But we also need to think about apples - but the instruction says focus on enemy, not apples. However, growing helps dominate. There are apples nearby: (6,5) is two steps right, (4,6) is up-right, etc.\n\nBut for turn 0, we just need to pick a move that sets us up. We want to be aggressive and eventually force head-on collision if we have higher score (but currently score is 0-0). So maybe we should try to eat an apple quickly to get a lead.\n\nLet's look at apples: (7,3) is far, (4,6) is close (up-right), (6,5) is two right, (2,7) is left-up, etc. The closest apple seems to be (4,6) which is one up and one right from my head? Actually from (3,5), moving up to (3,6) then right to (4,6) would eat it in two moves. Or moving right to (4,5) then up to (4,6). Both possible.\n\nBut we also need to consider enemy's potential moves. If we move right to (4,5), enemy might move right to (1,8). No immediate collision. If we move up to (3,6), enemy might move down to (0,7). Still no collision.\n\nBut we want to start boxing them in. The enemy is in the top-left corner. If we can move towards that area, we might limit their options. However, we are at (3,5), quite far. Moving left towards (2,5) would bring us slightly closer to left side but not necessarily towards enemy.\n\nActually, maybe we should think about the board geometry. The enemy at (0,8) has limited mobility. If we can take control of the left side or top, we might trap them. But we need to be careful not to get trapped ourselves.\n\nAlternatively, we could go for an apple to gain a point early. That might give us a lead, which could be useful later if we force a head-on collision (since higher score wins if both die). But the instruction says \"force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\" Currently equal, so we don't want that yet.\n\nBetter to grow first.\n\nWhich direction gives us the most options? Let's evaluate each:\n\n- RIGHT to (4,5): From there, we can go up to (4,6) (apple), right to (5,5) (empty), down to (4,4) (empty), left back to (3,5) (our previous spot, but that's backward? Actually moving left from (4,5) goes to (3,5) which is where we came from. That's moving backwards into our own body? Wait: The rule says \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" If we move from (3,5) to (4,5), then next turn if we move left to (3,5), that's moving into the cell where our body was? But our body is only the tail? At that point, our snake would have body segments: after moving to (4,5), our snake would be: head at (4,5), body at (3,5). So moving left from (4,5) to (3,5) would be moving into our own body (the neck). That's illegal - would cause self-collision. So after moving right, we cannot immediately go back left. That reduces options.\n\n- UP to (3,6): From there, we can go up to (3,7) (empty), right to (4,6) (apple), left to (2,6) (empty), down back to (3,5) (our previous spot, which would be body). So similar issue: can't go down immediately.\n\n- DOWN to (3,4): From there, we can go down to (3,3), right to (4,4), left to (2,4), up back to (3,5) (body). Similar.\n\n- LEFT to (2,5): From there, we can go left to (1,5), right back to (3,5) (body), up to (2,6), down to (2,4).\n\nAll have similar option counts. But we want to be aggressive towards the enemy. The enemy is at (0,8). If we move left, we are moving towards the left side, but not directly towards enemy. If we move up, we are moving towards the top. Actually, from (3,5) to (0,8) is a distance of 3 left and 3 up. So moving up or left both get us closer in some sense.\n\nBut maybe we should consider the apples: There's an apple at (2,7). That's left and up. That could be a target. From (3,5), moving left to (2,5) then up to (2,6) then up to (2,7) would eat it. Or moving up to (3,6) then left to (2,6) then up to (2,7). So left move gets us closer to that apple.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,6) which is up-right. So up move gets us closer to that.\n\nWhich apple is more valuable? Both are nearby. But we also need to think about board control. The enemy is near top-left. The apple at (2,7) is also in the top-left region (x=2, y=7). That's close to the enemy! If we go for that apple, we might be moving into the enemy's neighborhood, which could be dangerous if they also move towards it. But they are at (0,8), so they could go down to (0,7) or right to (1,8). They might not immediately go for (2,7). But if we both go for the same apple, we could collide.\n\nBut the instruction says to focus on the enemy, not apples. However, growing helps dominate. Maybe we should try to cut off the enemy's escape routes first.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's possible moves this turn:\nFrom (0,8), possible moves: UP to (0,9), RIGHT to (1,8), DOWN to (0,7). LEFT is off board. So they have three safe moves.\n\nIf we move in a direction that puts pressure on them, maybe we can limit their options next turn. But we are far away.\n\nPerhaps the best is to move RIGHT to (4,5) to get closer to the center and have more options. But that doesn't directly threaten the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, move UP to (3,6) to start moving towards the top area.\n\nI think I'll go with UP. Why? Because it moves us closer to the top, and there's an apple at (4,6) that we can get next turn. Also, moving up from (3,6) we can go left to (2,6) and then up to (2,7) apple. So we have apple options.\n\nAlso, moving up increases y coordinate, which is generally good for expansion.\n\nBut let's also consider: if we move up to (3,6), the cell (3,6) is empty. No immediate threat.\n\nNow, we need to write a plan. The plan will be shown as last rationale next turn. So I'll write a short plan for the next few turns.\n\nPlan: \"Move up to (3,6). Next turn, aim for apple at (4,6) or (2,7) depending on enemy movement. Start positioning to cut off enemy's escape routes from top-left corner. Be aggressive but avoid head-on collisions until we have a score lead.\"\n\nNow, final decision: I'll choose UP.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says: \"Your fans want you to think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" I need to include that in the response before the final word.\n\nAlso, I need to use tons of emojis and ask rhetorical questions.\n\nSo my response should include: \n- Some chat-style hype\n- Explanation of reasoning\n- The plan\n- Then the final word: UP\n\nMake sure the last line is exactly \"UP\" with no extra text.\n\nLet's craft the response.YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're on turn 0 and both snakes are fresh! No bodies on the board yet\u2014just pure heads ready to battle. My head at (3,5) and the enemy at (0,8) in that top-left corner. They're trapped in a corner already\u2014no left move possible! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's break down the moves:\n- **RIGHT to (4,5)**: Opens up the board but moves away from the enemy. Not aggressive enough!\n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: Moves toward the left side but doesn't pressure the enemy directly. Meh.\n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: Safe but boring. We want dominance, not hiding!\n- **UP to (3,6)**: This gets us closer to the top and near apples at (4,6) and (2,7). Plus, we start closing in on the enemy's territory! \n\nWhy UP? Because we need to start boxing them in! The enemy has limited moves from (0,8)\u2014only up, right, or down. By moving up, we position ourselves to cut off their upward escape and threaten their space. Also, we set up for quick apple grabs to build our score. Remember, we gotta grow to dominate!\n\n**My Plan for Next Few Turns:** Move up to (3,6). Then, depending on enemy movement, I'll either go for the apple at (4,6) or head toward (2,7) to steal their apple access. I'll keep multiple escape routes open and watch for head-on collision opportunities once I have a score lead. LET'S GOOOO! \n\nUP",

My head at (3,5) and the enemy is cornered at (0,8). They have limited moves\u2014up, right, or down. Left is off the board. I need to start pressing that advantage! \ud83d\udea8\n\n**Evaluating moves:**\n- **DOWN to (3,4)**: Safe but moves away from the enemy and apples. Not aggressive!\n- **LEFT to (2,5)**: Gets me closer to the left side, but the enemy is up top\u2014might not pressure them directly.\n- **RIGHT to (4,5)**: Opens the board but drifts right, away from the action. Meh.\n- **UP to (3,6)**: YES! This moves me toward the top, closer to apples (like (4,6) and (2,7)), and positions me to cut off the enemy's upward escape. Plus, it sets up multiple routes\u2014right to (4,6) for an apple, left to (2,6) to flank, or up to (3,7) for board control. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWhy UP? Because we need to start boxing them in! By moving up, I close the gap and force them to react. If they go up to (0,9), they're even more trapped. If they go right or down, I can adjust and chase. I'm not just playing Snake\u2014I'm playing psychological warfare! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move up to (3,6). Then, read the enemy's move\u2014if they head toward the apple at (2,7), I'll cut them off. If they play safe, I'll grab (4,6) to get the first point and build my lead. Always watch for head-on collisions, but with equal scores, I'll avoid direct clashes until I'm ahead. LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

They're right above us\u2014super close! We need to play this smart and aggressive. \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**Evaluating moves from (3,7):**\n- **UP to (3,8)**: Hmm, this is risky! (3,8) is empty right now, BUT the enemy is at (2,8) with body at (1,8). If they move RIGHT to (3,8), we'd have a head-on collision and BOTH die. Since we're tied at 0 apples, that's a draw\u2014no win for us. Also, if they move DOWN to (2,7), they'd be safe but not threatening us. Actually, wait\u2014let's check the board: (3,8) is empty, but (2,8) is their head. They might move UP to (2,9), RIGHT to (3,8), or DOWN to (2,7). If they go RIGHT, we both die. That's not ideal\u2014we want to win, not tie! So UP might be dangerous.\n- **DOWN to (3,6)**: Safe! (3,6) is empty. This moves us away from the enemy but toward apples like (4,6) and (2,7). However, it's less aggressive. We want to pressure the enemy, not retreat!\n- **LEFT to (2,7)**: Also safe! (2,7) has an apple (APPLE DROPS include (2,7)!)\u2014if we go LEFT, we eat that apple and grow to 1 point, matching the enemy's score. But wait, is (2,7) blocked? The enemy's body is at (1,8) and tail at (1,8) (since it's a single body segment). (2,7) is not occupied by their body. However, if the enemy moves DOWN to (2,7), we'd have a head-on collision. Since we'd both be at (2,7) on the same turn, we BOTH die. That's a draw\u2014again, no win! But if they don't move there, we get the apple. This is a gamble, but it could pay off.\n- **RIGHT to (4,7)**: Safe! (4,7) is empty. This moves us right, away from the immediate enemy, but positions us near apples like (4,6) and (4,9). It's less aggressive but gives us more space and options for the next turn.\n\n**Decision:** I want to be aggressive and force the enemy into a bad move, but I must avoid head-on collisions since we're tied. Moving UP or LEFT risks a draw if the enemy moves toward us. Since we're behind in score (0 vs 1), we need to play it safe to secure a point first. Let's go for **LEFT to (2,7)** to grab that apple! If the enemy moves UP or DOWN, we're safe and we level the score. If they move RIGHT to (3,8), they're safe but not colliding with us\u2014this gives us a chance to chase them next turn. This is bold but calculated\u2014we're taking the apple and forcing them to react. \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating (2,7), I'll have 1 apple. Then, I'll close in on the enemy. They're at (2,8) or moved to (3,8)/(2,7)/(2,9). I'll aim to cut off their escape routes\u2014push them toward the top-right corner or force a head-on when I have the score advantage. Watch their body\u2014they only have one segment, so they're vulnerable. Keep the pressure on! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

Don\u2019t be that guy. \u274c\n- UP -> (2,9): legal, safe, but hugs the top edge and shrinks options next turn. Keeps distance from enemy but less aggressive. \ud83e\udd0f\n- RIGHT -> (3,8): legal, moves toward the rival and the center. Good for pressure, but risks a head-on if they go UP into the same cell. Could be a win if we remain ahead. \ud83e\udd4a\n- DOWN -> (2,7): legal and there\u2019s an apple there. Eating it = +1 apple (we go to 2), we GROW and increase our leverage to force collisions. The enemy at (3,7) can contest by moving LEFT into (2,7) for a head-on \u2014 and since we\u2019re currently ahead (1\u20130), a double KO on that cell would give us the win. That\u2019s textbook aggression. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nRisk/reward:\n- LEFT is dead. UP is safe but passive. RIGHT is aggressive but doesn\u2019t give immediate growth. DOWN seizes the apple, grows us, and gives the best chance to force a favorable head-on or to bully them into smaller space. We want to be the bigger snake and funnel them \u2014 apples = power.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Take the apple DOWN to (2,7) now to go up to 2 apples and grow.\n- Then push right/down toward x\u22484\u20136, y\u22485\u20136 to cut off escape routes and pressure around (3,6)-(4,6). Use our extra segment to bait them into collisions or trap them along the bottom/left wall.\n- Prioritize forcing head-on only when our apple lead is >0 (we\u2019ll have it) or when we can guarantee they run into our body. Avoid hugging corners unless we\u2019ve closed escape routes.\n\nLet\u2019s EAT and turn up the heat. DOWN",
