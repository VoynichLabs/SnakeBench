No, check board: at (1, 7) there\u2019s no apple (board shows \u2018.\u2019 at row 7 col 1? Wait, y=7, x=1). Let's check: Row 7 (y=7): \". A . . . . . . . .\" so (1,7) is empty.  \n- Apples from list near (1,8): (0,5) is far, (1,3) far, (1,1) far, (1,7) not apple. (0,0), (7,6), etc. Nearest apple to (1,8) is maybe (4,8)? That's at (4,8) apple? Yes, board row 8: \". 1 . . A . A . . .\" so (4,8) is apple.  \n\nSo apple at (4,8) is 3 steps right from me.  \nAlso apple at (6,8) is at (6,8) apple?

Yes (3,9) apple. But UP then RIGHT would take longer to get to apples.  \n- If I go DOWN to (1,7), no apple there, but then I could go to (1,6), etc., apples farther.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove toward nearest apple cluster: apples at (4,8) and (6,8). So RIGHT is good.  \n\n**Possible head-on collision risk?**  \nEnemy at (8,4), moving maybe toward (9,4) apple? That\u2019s far, no collision risk this turn.  \n\nSo safest and best move: RIGHT toward apples and keeps many future options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** Continue toward (4,8) apple, but watch enemy movement.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Wait, (1, 7) is apple? Board shows row 7: \". A . . . . . . . .\" so (1, 7) is apple.

Actually from (2, 8), DOWN goes to (2, 7) \u2014 no apple there. LEFT goes to (1, 8) \u2014 no apple there. So (1, 7) is diagonal, not directly reachable in one move.  \n\nFrom (2, 8):\n- RIGHT moves toward (4, 8) and (6, 8).\n- UP moves toward (3, 9) apple.\n- DOWN moves toward (1, 7) apple next turn maybe.\n- LEFT moves away from most apples except (0, 5) far down.\n\n**Enemy position:** Enemy at (9, 4) with body at (8, 4). They might move toward apple at (9, 1) or (8, 3), but far from me. No direct collision risk.\n\n**Future options:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 8), next turn I can go RIGHT again toward (4, 8) apple, or UP/DOWN to avoid dead ends.  \nIf I go UP to (2, 9), then next turn maybe go RIGHT toward (3, 9) apple.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7), then next turn LEFT to (1, 7) apple.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8), then next turn DOWN to (1, 7) apple.\n\nSo DOWN then LEFT gets me an apple in two moves. LEFT then DOWN also gets me apple in two moves. But RIGHT gets me apple at (4, 8) in two moves as well. Which is safer?\n\n**Safety check:** All moves safe now, but think ahead:  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8), then my body will be at (2, 8) next turn. Then DOWN to (1, 7) apple means my head goes into (1, 7), my body at (1, 8) and (2, 8). That\u2019s fine.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7), then LEFT to (1, 7) apple is fine too.\n\nBut enemy is far away, so immediate apple gathering is good.\n\n**Decision:** Go for nearest apple quickly: (1, 7) apple is closest in Manhattan distance (|2-1| + |8-7| = 2 steps). To get there in 2 moves, I can go DOWN now, then LEFT next turn. Or LEFT now, then DOWN next turn. Which is better?  \n\nCheck board: If I go LEFT to (1, 8), then DOWN to (1, 7) apple. That\u2019s fine.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7), then LEFT to (1, 7) apple. Also fine.\n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN now because it keeps my x-position closer to center (more options later) and still gets apple next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2, 7), move LEFT to (1, 7) to eat apple, unless enemy moves into that area (unlikely).\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Actually: If I don\u2019t eat apple this turn, my tail stays at (1,7) because snake moves: head to (1,5), tail stays? No \u2014 snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves forward one cell, so tail moves to old head position (1,6).

So enemy likely won\u2019t go LEFT into its body unless forced.  \n\nDistance from me: (0,6) to (9,2) \u2192 far (9 in x, 4 in y), no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \nClosest apple is (0,5) \u2192 DOWN now eats it.  \nNext nearest apples: (1,3), (0,0), (1,1), (7,6), etc.  \n\n**Consequences of each safe move:**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (0,5) and eat apple:**  \n   - Grow to length 3. New head at (0,5), body becomes [(0,6), (1,6)].  \n   - Next turn from (0,5): possible moves UP to (0,6) (my body), DOWN to (0,4) free, RIGHT to (1,5) free, LEFT off board. So only DOWN and RIGHT available. That\u2019s risky because only 2 moves.  \n   - But eating apple is good for score.  \n\n2. **UP to (0,7):**  \n   - No apple eaten.  \n   - Next turn from (0,7): body becomes [(0,6), (1,6)] (tail moves forward).  \n   - Moves from (0,7): UP to (0,8) free, DOWN to (0,6) (my body), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,7) free. So UP and RIGHT available next turn \u2192 2 moves again but slightly better because (0,8) is closer to apples (4,8) and (6,8) later.  \n\nEating apple now would trap me next turn with only DOWN and RIGHT. That\u2019s manageable if I plan ahead, but if enemy approaches later, limited moves could be dangerous.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need to grow but also keep mobility. Eating apple (0,5) now reduces next turn\u2019s options to 2, but after that, moving DOWN to (0,4) opens up again.  \n\nActually, check: If I go DOWN to (0,5) and eat apple, my body segments: head at (0,5), body segments: old head (0,6) and old body (1,6). Next turn tail stays at (1,6) if I eat apple? Wait \u2014 rule: If you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn, so tail doesn\u2019t move. So after eating apple: head at (0,5), body: [(0,6), (1,6)], tail at (1,6) stays. Next turn, moving without eating apple: head moves, all segments shift, tail moves to old neck (0,6).  \n\nSo next turn from (0,5) after eating apple: body at (0,6) and (1,6). UP to (0,6) is body \u2192 blocked. DOWN to (0,4) free. RIGHT to (1,5) free. LEFT off board. So 2 moves.  \n\nIf I go UP to (0,7) without eating: body becomes [(0,6), (1,6)] after move. Next turn from (0,7): UP to (0,8) free, DOWN to (0,6) body \u2192 blocked, RIGHT to (1,7) free, LEFT off board \u2192 2 moves as well.  \n\nSo both options give 2 moves next turn. But DOWN gets me an apple and moves toward more apples at bottom left.  \n\n**Risk:** Enemy snake #0 is at (9,2), far away.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take the apple now to catch up in score (enemy has 2 apples, I have 1). After eating, I can go DOWN next turn to (0,4) to keep moving toward (0,0) apple or (1,3) apple.  \n\nDOWN",

This is my own body.\n*   **DOWN**: (8, 0) - **SAFE**. Moves toward apples at (7, 0) and (6, 0).\n*   **LEFT**: (7, 1) - **SAFE**. Target apple located at (7, 1).\n*   **RIGHT**: (9, 1) - **CRASH**. This is my own body (the neck segment).\n\n**2. Safe Move Analysis:**\n*   **LEFT (7, 1)**: This is the most efficient move. It immediately collects an apple at (7, 1). After eating this apple, my head will be at (7, 1), and I will be positioned perfectly to collect surrounding apples at (7, 2), (7, 0), or (6, 0). My body will grow to length 5 next turn.\n*   **DOWN (8, 0)**: This move is safe and keeps me on the board, but it bypasses the immediate apple at (7, 1) and brings me closer to the edge.\n\n**3. Apple Analysis:**\nThe current board has a high density of apples near my position: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 0), and (6, 0) are all within a 2-step radius. Moving LEFT to (7, 1) is the fastest way to increase score.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 5), currently moving on the opposite side of the board. There is no immediate threat of intersection or head-on collision.\n\n**5. Strategy/Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to consume the apple at (7, 1). This increases my score to 4. From (7, 1), I will evaluate the next most efficient path to (7, 2), (7, 0), or (6, 0) depending on Snake #1's movement. Priority is to stay along the bottom right/middle area to sweep the cluster.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 body: [(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(9,2),(8,2)] \u2192 not there. My body? My body is [(1,4),(1,5),(0,5)] \u2192 not there. So safe cell except apple.  \n   - But check enemy head movement: Snake #0 head at (7,0). Possible moves for enemy: UP\u2192(7,1) (its own body) so maybe not UP; LEFT\u2192(6,0) (apple maybe); RIGHT\u2192(8,0) (empty); DOWN\u2192(7,-1) invalid.  \n     Could enemy move to (1,2)? No, too far.  \n   - So DOWN seems safe. Eating apple would grow me by 1, tail stays? Actually: snake growth: when you eat apple, you grow by 1 at the end of the move (head moves to apple, new head at apple, tail stays same unless growth). So length becomes 5 after move.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 Empty? Board shows \u201c.\u201d at (0,3) row 3 col 0. No apple there. Safe from enemy body and my body.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 Empty, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is suicide (into own body).  \n\n**Considerations:**  \n- DOWN goes to (1,2) apple \u2192 immediate score increase to 4 apples.  \n- But after eating apple, my body will be: new head at (1,2), then body: old head (1,3) becomes segment 2, then (1,4), (1,5), (0,5). So tail stays at (0,5) for now.  \n- Future mobility from (1,2): possible moves UP\u2192(1,3) (will be my body after move), LEFT\u2192(0,2) empty, RIGHT\u2192(2,2) empty, DOWN\u2192(1,1) apple (but apple at (1,1) yes). So from (1,2) UP blocked by own body, but 3 other directions open, one leads to another apple. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**LEFT** to (0,3): from there, possible moves: UP\u2192(0,4) empty, RIGHT\u2192(1,3) (my old head position, will be body after move), DOWN\u2192(0,2) empty, LEFT invalid (off board). So 3 safe moves from there too, but no immediate apple.  \n\n**RIGHT** to (2,3): from there, UP\u2192(2,4) empty, DOWN\u2192(2,2) empty, LEFT\u2192(1,3) body, RIGHT\u2192(3,3) empty. Also 3 safe moves, no immediate apple.  \n\nGiven I want to maximize apples safely, DOWN seems best \u2014 but must check head-on collision risk:  \nEnemy head at (7,0). Could enemy move to (1,2)? No. Could enemy move to (0,3) or (2,3)? No. So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\nAlso need to avoid moving into where enemy head might go if they move into same cell:  \nEnemy possible moves from (7,0):  \n- UP (7,1) own body \u2192 maybe they avoid?  \n- LEFT (6,0) apple \u2192 possible.  \n- RIGHT (8,0) empty \u2192 possible.  \n- DOWN invalid.  \n\nNone of these intersect my possible moves (1,2), (0,3), (2,3). So safe.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI\u2019m shorter than snake #0 (they have 5 apples \u2192 length 6? Wait: apples = 5, length = apples+1? Actually initial length unknown, but at least 6 segments). They are far away now. I should eat nearby apples to catch up. After (1,2) apple, maybe go to (1,1) apple next turn, then (0,0) apple. That\u2019s a path: (1,2) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (0,0) eating two more apples quickly. But be careful: from (1,1) to (0,0) is LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT? Actually from (1,1), DOWN\u2192(1,0) empty, LEFT\u2192(0,1) empty. To reach (0,0) from (1,1) need to go LEFT to (0,1) then DOWN to (0,0), or DOWN to (1,0) then LEFT to (0,0). That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Final choice:** DOWN to eat apple safely and continue growth.  \n\nDOWN",

After taking (5, 1), I will look to either go DOWN/LEFT toward the apple at (3, 0) or UP toward (6, 4) and (5, 5). Given the body configuration, moving away from my own segments is priority to maintain mobility.\n\nLEFT",

From (1, 0), next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 0) apple, RIGHT to (2, 0) empty, or UP back to (1, 1) which will be empty after this move (tail moves? Let\u2019s check). My tail is at (0, 5) now. If I don\u2019t eat an apple this turn, my tail will move forward, so (0, 5) becomes empty next turn. My head moving to (1, 0) means my body will be: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)] \u2014 wait, that\u2019s wrong: let\u2019s track carefully.  \n\nCurrent body: head (1, 1), then [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5)].  \nIf I move DOWN to (1, 0), new head at (1, 0), then my body becomes: old head (1, 1) as first segment, then (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5). Last segment (0, 5) disappears (tail moves forward). So (0, 5) empty next turn.  \n\nFrom (1, 0), possible moves:  \nUP to (1, 1) \u2014 safe (empty after this turn).  \nLEFT to (0, 0) \u2014 apple!  \nRIGHT to (2, 0) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN invalid (off board).  \n\nSo DOWN now gives me 3 safe moves next turn, one leads to apple (0, 0).  \n\n- **LEFT (0, 1)**: no apple. From (0, 1), possible next moves: UP (0, 2) empty, RIGHT (1, 1) empty after this turn, DOWN (0, 0) apple. Also 3 safe moves, one leads to apple (0, 0).  \n\n- **RIGHT (2, 1)**: no apple. From (2, 1), possible next moves: UP (2, 2) empty, DOWN (2, 0) empty, LEFT (1, 1) empty, RIGHT (3, 1) empty. All safe but no immediate apple in 1 step except maybe (3, 0) later.  \n\nComparing: DOWN and LEFT both set up apple (0, 0) next turn. Which is safer?  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 1), enemy could move to (5, 1) apple, but that\u2019s far. No direct threat.  \n\nActually, apple at (0, 0) is reachable from both (1, 0) and (0, 1) next turn. But going DOWN to (1, 0) might be slightly better because:  \nFrom (1, 0), I can go LEFT to (0, 0) apple, then from (0, 0) I can go UP to (0, 1) or RIGHT to (1, 0) (but that\u2019s my body then). Hmm, might box myself if not careful.  \n\nFrom (0, 1), after eating (0, 0), I\u2019d be at (0, 0) with body behind me at (0, 1), so UP to (0, 1) blocked, RIGHT to (1, 0) possible.  \n\nBoth fine.  \n\nBut there\u2019s also apple at (3, 0) \u2014 if I go DOWN to (1, 0), then next turn after (0, 0) apple, I can go to (1, 0) then (2, 0) then (3, 0) apple. That\u2019s efficient.  \n\nLet\u2019s pick DOWN for now to get to (1, 0), then (0, 0) apple next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTurn 11: DOWN to (1, 0).  \nTurn 12: LEFT to (0, 0) apple.  \nThen head toward (3, 0) apple while avoiding enemy.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Moves toward (4, 6) and (3, 0).\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 2). **SAFE**. Closer to apple at (7, 2).\n\n**2. Safe Move Analysis:**\n- **UP (5, 3)**: Very safe. Keeps me central and heading toward a high density of apples.\n- **RIGHT (6, 2)**: Targets the closest apple at (7, 2).

(5, 5) is 3 steps away (UP, UP, UP).\n- Snake #1 is at (2, 0). Its closest apples are (0, 0) or (3, 0).\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis:**\n- Snake #1 is currently at (2, 0).

No \u2014 simultaneous moves only 1 step.  \nEnemy at (5, 2) cannot reach (2, 1) in one move (distance = |5-2|+|2-1| = 3+1=4).

Wait, length is 6 now, tail at (1, 4) will move forward?  \n\nLet\u2019s simulate: current length 6, no apple eaten last turn (last move was RIGHT to (2, 0) empty). So tail moved from (1, 5) to (1, 4)? Actually last turn my body was [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)] head at (1, 0), I moved RIGHT to (2, 0), so new head (2, 0), body becomes [(1, 0), (1, 1), \u2026, (1, 5)], but tail (1, 5) disappears, new tail is (1, 4). Yes, so currently body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)].  \n\nNow if I move UP to (2, 1), still no apple, so tail moves forward: tail (1, 4) disappears, new body: head (2, 1), then (2, 0), then (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3).  \n\nFrom (2, 1) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 0): body segment (2, 0) will be second segment then, so invalid.  \n- LEFT (1, 1): body segment then, invalid.  \n- RIGHT (3, 1): empty.  \n\nSo from (2, 1), only UP and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 2 options.  \n\nRIGHT (3, 0):  \n- No apple at (3, 0) (apple at (3, 9) far away).  \n- Tail moves forward: tail (1, 4) disappears, new body: head (3, 0), then (2, 0), then (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3).  \n\nFrom (3, 0) next turn:  \n- UP (3, 1): empty.  \n- DOWN (3, -1): off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (2, 0): body segment then, invalid.  \n- RIGHT (4, 0): empty.  \n\nSo from (3, 0), only UP and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 also 2 options.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT give same number of safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (3, 0) not an apple \u2014 actually check list: apples at (3, 9), (9, 0), etc. Nearest apples to (2, 0): (3, 0) not in list. Closest apples: (3, 0)? No. (0, 0) apple but I can\u2019t go LEFT. (3, 9) far. (6, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (7, 2), (4, 6), etc.  \n\nFrom (2, 0), UP gets me closer to (6, 4), (5, 5) area via y-increase. RIGHT keeps me low y, near apples (9, 0) and (3, 0)? Actually (3, 0) no apple. (9, 0) apple but far.  \n\nUP seems better for accessing central apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (5, 2), length 8, apples 7 vs my 5. It\u2019s longer. If I go UP to (2, 1), enemy could move toward (4, 2) etc., but not immediate danger.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 0), I\u2019m near bottom edge \u2014 fewer escape routes if enemy comes down.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to survive and collect apples while avoiding dead ends. UP gives more future flexibility because I can go to (2, 2) next, opening more options. RIGHT leads to (3, 0) with only UP/RIGHT next, possibly near bottom edge trap.  \n\nGiven that enemy is northeast, moving UP centralizes me slightly but safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP.\n\nUP",

If enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 2), it\u2019s moving away from me. If enemy goes UP to (6, 3), still not threatening me immediately.  \n\nI should avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily. UP goes slightly toward central area but still safe. RIGHT goes east, possibly toward more apples but also toward enemy if enemy moves left later. But enemy\u2019s left is blocked by its body currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m shorter than enemy (length 6 vs 8). Need apples. Right now, (3, 0) apple is one move away if I go RIGHT then DOWN. That\u2019s tempting. Also, RIGHT gives 3 safe moves next turn vs UP\u2019s 2. More options mean less chance of being trapped.  \n\nI\u2019ll go RIGHT this turn, then next turn strongly consider DOWN to (3, 0) for apple unless enemy threatens.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

This is part of my tail/body.\n- **LEFT**: (6, 2). **CRASH**. This is my neck/body.\n- **RIGHT**: (8, 2). **SAFE**. Moves toward the right wall. The nearest apple in this direction is (9, 0) or (8, 8).\n\n**2. Safe Move Analysis:**\n- **UP (7, 3)**: Safe. This direction is very open. It positions me perfectly to sweep through the central and upper-right clusters of apples [(6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (8, 9), (3, 9)].\n- **RIGHT (8, 2)**: Safe. However, it moves me away from the main cluster and closer to the edge of the board. My tail at (8, 1) is currently below this position.\n\n**3. Apple Analysis:**\nThe board is filled with apples. The highest density is in the upper half.\n- Nearest to head: (6, 4) is 3 steps away via (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4).\n- (5, 5) is 5 steps away.\n- (7, 6) is 4 steps away.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (3, 1). It is relatively far away. If it moves RIGHT toward (4, 1), it is still 3 units away from my current path. It is currently somewhat constrained by the apples at (3, 0) and (0, 0) and its own body.\n\n**5. Strategy/Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to exit the self-created \"U\" shape formed by my body at y=0,1,2. By moving UP, I gain access to the large cluster of apples in the upper-middle section of the board. This will allow me to maintain my lead and work toward the 30-apple goal. I will prioritize the cluster around (6, 4) and (7, 6) first.\n\nUP",

This is my neck/body.\n*   **LEFT**: (6, 4). **SAFE**. Directly on top of an apple.\n*   **RIGHT**: (8, 4). **SAFE**. Moves toward the right wall.\n\n**2. Safe Move Analysis:**\n*   **LEFT (6, 4)** is the strongest move. It secures an immediate apple, increasing my score to 9. It is also safe from Snake #1, whose head is at (4, 2) and cannot reach (6, 4) this turn.\n*   **UP (7, 5)** is safe and puts me in a good position to sweep the upper apple cluster, but collecting the immediate apple at (6, 4) is more efficient.\n*   **RIGHT (8, 4)** moves away from the cluster of apples.\n\n**3. Apple Analysis:**\n*   Target 1: (6, 4) - 1 move (LEFT).\n*   Target 2: (5, 5) or (5, 4) - Following the LEFT move, I can target (5, 5) or (5, 6).\n*   Target 3: (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9) cluster in the top right.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (4, 2). If it moves UP to (4, 3) and then RIGHT towards (6, 4), it would still be a turn behind me in reaching that space. By taking (6, 4) now, I maintain my lead and spatial control over the center-right part of the board.\n\n**5. Strategy/Long-term Plan:**\nI will take the apple at (6, 4) this turn. After that, I intend to weave through the center cluster (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), then move upwards toward (4, 8) and (6, 8). My body is currently long (9 segments), so I must ensure I don't box myself in as I move through the center. Taking (6, 4) and then moving UP toward (5, 5) keeps my pathing flexible.\n\nLEFT",

However, moving here puts me between Snake #1 and my own tail at (7, 4)/(7, 3), potentially narrowing my escape routes.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 4):** **SAFE.** Puts me horizontally adjacent to Snake #1's head at (4, 3). If Snake #1 moves UP to (4, 4), we are safe, but it begins a close-quarters situation.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 4):** **COLLISION.** This is my neck/body.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (4, 3). Its available moves are UP (4, 4), LEFT (3, 3), and RIGHT (5, 3). It cannot move DOWN as (4, 2) is its neck.\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 5), I am well clear of any head-on collision from Snake #1.\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis:**\n    *   Nearest apples: (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (7, 6).\n    *   Moving UP to (6, 5) positions me to take (5, 5) or (7, 6) on the next turn.\n\n5.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Move UP to (6, 5) to enter the apple-rich center/top-right area.\n    *   Target (5, 5) and (5, 6) while maintaining distance from Snake #1.\n    *   My body is currently wrapping around the bottom right; heading UP allows me to keep the center of the board open for maneuvering as I grow.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nI will move UP to capitalize on the cluster of apples in the middle-top. Moving LEFT would bring me too close to Snake #1 needlessly, and moving DOWN restricts my movement against my own body. UP offers the most pathing flexibility and brings me closer to multiple targets.\n\nUP",

This moves me closer to Snake #1 (one cell away), but since his head is at (4, 4), he cannot reach (5, 5) this turn.\n    *   **UP (6, 6):** **SAFE**. Moves toward apples at (5, 6) and (7, 6).\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 5):** **SAFE**. Space is empty.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 4):** **COLLISION** with my own neck.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (4, 4). His possible moves are UP (4, 5), LEFT (3, 4), and RIGHT (5, 4). He cannot move DOWN (4, 3).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 5), and he moves RIGHT to (5, 4), we will be adjacent. This is a common \"shadowing\" position but safe for this turn.\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis:**\n    *   The closest apple is at (5, 5).\n    *   Other nearby apples: (5, 6), (4, 6), (7, 6).\n    *   There is a dense cluster of apples in the middle-top: (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (4, 8), (6, 8), (8, 8).\n\n5.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Taking the apple at (5, 5) is the most efficient path.

If he moves RIGHT to (5, 4) while I move LEFT to (5, 5), he might try to cut me off or force a head-on collision at (5, 6) or (4, 5) on the following turn. However, I have enough space to the RIGHT or UP to maneuver if he gets too aggressive.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab the apple at (5, 5), then evaluate the cluster at (5, 6), (4, 6), and (7, 6). Keep an eye on Snake #1's movement to ensure I don't get boxed into the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s check board display: at (4,6) it shows 'A'? Wait, board shows row 6: (4,6) is 'A', yes. So UP is apple.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4): my own body segment \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5): board shows '.'  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5): enemy head currently \u2192 would be head-on collision this turn if enemy stays or moves into me. But enemy is at (5,5) now, so moving RIGHT into enemy\u2019s current head position is instant death (head-on collision). So RIGHT is **not safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5,5):**  \nEnemy could move:  \nUP (5,6): apple  \nDOWN (5,4): '.'  \nLEFT (4,5): my head currently \u2192 possible head-on if I move LEFT to (3,5) and enemy moves LEFT to (4,5) \u2014 no, wait, if enemy moves LEFT to (4,5) and I move LEFT to (3,5), we don\u2019t collide. But if I move UP to (4,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (4,5), also no collision.  \nRIGHT (6,5): its own body (segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check head-on collision risks this turn:**  \n- If I go UP to (4,6), enemy could go LEFT to (4,5) (my old head position) \u2014 no collision.  \n- If I go LEFT to (3,5), enemy could go LEFT to (4,5) \u2014 no collision.  \n- But if enemy goes UP to (5,6), no collision with either of my moves.  \n- If enemy goes DOWN to (5,4), no collision.  \n\nSo both UP and LEFT avoid head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**Option UP (4,6):**  \nEat apple \u2192 grow to length 7. New body: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]  \nFrom (4,6) next turn:  \nUP (4,7): '.'  \nDOWN (4,5): my body \u2192 invalid  \nLEFT (3,6): '.'  \nRIGHT (5,6): apple (but enemy might be there if enemy goes UP this turn)  \nSo safe next moves: UP, LEFT, possibly RIGHT (if enemy not there).  \n\n**Option LEFT (3,5):**  \nNo apple eaten. New body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], tail (3,1) gone.  \nFrom (3,5) next turn:  \nUP (3,6): '.'  \nDOWN (3,4): '.'  \nLEFT (2,5): '.'  \nRIGHT (4,5): my body \u2192 invalid  \nAll except RIGHT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple gathering vs safety:**  \nEnemy is longer (length 11 vs my 6). If I eat apple at (4,6), I grow and stay near other apples (5,6), (7,6), etc. But enemy is at (5,5) and might go UP to (5,6) this turn \u2014 then next turn I\u2019d be at (4,6) with enemy at (5,6), which is fine, no immediate collision.  \n\nGoing LEFT avoids apple but opens space. However, I need apples to catch up (5 vs 10 apples).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nCatch up on apples but avoid head-on with longer snake. Favor moves that keep distance from enemy head unless I can trap it. Currently, enemy is close, so maybe go UP to eat apple and be ready to go UP again to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,6) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

So RIGHT is unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5,6):**  \nEnemy could move:  \nUP (5,7): '.'  \nDOWN (5,5): own body \u2192 invalid  \nLEFT (4,6): my head currently \u2192 possible head-on if I move LEFT to (3,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (4,6)? If enemy moves LEFT to (4,6) and I move LEFT to (3,6), we don\u2019t collide. If enemy moves LEFT to (4,6) and I move UP to (4,7), also no collision.  \nRIGHT (6,6): board '.'  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\n- If I go UP to (4,7), enemy could go LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 no collision (my old spot).  \n- If I go LEFT to (3,6), enemy could go LEFT to (4,6) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If enemy goes UP to (5,7), no collision with either of my moves.  \n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (6,6), no collision.  \n\nSo both UP and LEFT avoid head-on this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**Option UP (4,7):**  \nNo apple eaten. New body: [(4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], tail (3,1) gone.  \nFrom (4,7) next turn:  \nUP (4,8): apple at (4,8)  \nDOWN (4,6): my body \u2192 invalid  \nLEFT (3,7): '.'  \nRIGHT (5,7): possibly safe if enemy not there \u2014 enemy could be there if enemy moves UP this turn.  \n\n**Option LEFT (3,6):**  \nNo apple eaten. New body: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], tail (3,1) gone.  \nFrom (3,6) next turn:  \nUP (3,7): '.'  \nDOWN (3,5): '.'  \nLEFT (2,6): '.'  \nRIGHT (4,6): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nLEFT seems to give more safe next moves (3 safe directions vs UP\u2019s 2 safe directions).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples near me: (4,8) is above (4,7) if I go UP this turn. Also (7,6), (6,8), etc., but enemy is at (5,6) now. Going LEFT to (3,6) moves me away from most apples but keeps me safer from enemy head.  \n\nEnemy is longer (12 vs my 7), so I should avoid risky head-on chances.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nCatch up on apples but stay alive. Currently enemy is close at (5,6). Moving LEFT opens more future safe moves and creates distance. UP puts me closer to apple at (4,8) but reduces escape options next turn (only UP or LEFT from (4,7), and RIGHT possibly blocked by enemy).  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage, survival is priority. LEFT seems safer for future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

(empty)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 5): board '.'  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 6): board '.'  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 6): my own body segment \u2192 **invalid**  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (6, 6):**  \n\nEnemy moves:  \nUP (6,7): '.'  \nDOWN (6,5): own body \u2192 invalid  \nLEFT (5,6): own body \u2192 invalid  \nRIGHT (7,6): apple at (7,6)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is **UP** to (6,7) or **RIGHT** to (7,6).  \nWait, check again: enemy body includes (5,6) and (6,5), so LEFT and DOWN are blocked.  \nUP (6,7) is empty. RIGHT (7,6) is apple.  \nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\nIf I go:  \n- UP to (3,7) \u2192 enemy could go UP to (6,7) or RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 no collision.  \n- DOWN to (3,5) \u2192 enemy same \u2192 no collision.  \n- LEFT to (2,6) \u2192 enemy same \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo all three moves avoid head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**Option UP (3,7):**  \nNo apple eaten.

If enemy goes RIGHT to (7,6) and eats apple, it grows, making it longer.  \nI need to collect apples to catch up, but safely.  \n\nUP to (3,7) keeps me central and near apple (4,8) for next turn.  \nLEFT to (2,6) moves away from enemy but also from many apples.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s possible moves, I\u2019m safer moving UP, because enemy will not be near (3,7) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Yes (y=9 valid)  \n  - Into own body? No (my body: (3,7),(3,6), etc.)  \n  - Into enemy body? Enemy body: (7,6),(6,6),(5,6),(5,5),(6,5),(6,4),(7,4),(7,3),(7,2),(6,2),(5,2),(5,1),(6,1) \u2013 not (3,9)  \n  - Apple at (3,9)? Yes \u2192 would eat apple, grow by 1 segment.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 7):  \n  - On board? Yes  \n  - Into own body? Yes! (3,7) is my second segment \u2192 immediate death \u2192 **illegal**  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 8):  \n  - On board? Yes  \n  - Into own body? No (my body has no (2,8))  \n  - Into enemy body? No (enemy body doesn\u2019t have (2,8))  \n  - Apple at (2,8)? Yes \u2192 would eat apple.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 8):  \n  - On board? Yes  \n  - Into own body? No  \n  - Into enemy body? No  \n  - Apple at (4,8)? Yes \u2192 would eat apple.  \n\nSo immediate death only for DOWN. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are physically safe.\n\n---\n\n**3) Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions**  \n\nEnemy head at (7, 7). Possible moves from there:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 6) \u2013 into its own body? Its body: (7,6) is second segment \u2192 illegal for enemy? Wait, enemy body: [(7,6), \u2026] yes (7,6) is occupied by enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 so enemy cannot move DOWN.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 7)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is suicide for them).  \n\nNow check if any of my moves could cause head-on collision:  \nHead-on collision means my new head position equals enemy\u2019s new head position after they move.  \n\nMy UP \u2192 (3, 9). Enemy UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 no collision.  \nEnemy LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 no. Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2013 no.  \n\nMy LEFT \u2192 (2, 8). Enemy UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 no. Enemy LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 no. Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2013 no.  \n\nMy RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8). Enemy UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 no. Enemy LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 no. Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2013 no.  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn regardless of enemy choice.\n\n---\n\n**4) Future mobility after each move**  \n\n**UP to (3, 9)**:  \n- Next turn from (3, 9): possible moves: DOWN (back to (3,8)), LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9).  \n  - DOWN: would go into (3,8) which will be empty next turn (since I left it now). But after eating apple at (3,9), my tail stays where? Wait, growth: new head at (3,9), body becomes old head (3,8) + old body. So (3,8) occupied by my new second segment next turn. So DOWN from (3,9) \u2192 (3,8) would be suicide next turn.  \n  - LEFT (2,9): safe if not occupied by enemy body then.  \n  - RIGHT (4,9): safe similarly.  \nSo from (3,9), only LEFT and RIGHT are possible next turn (DOWN suicide). That\u2019s 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 8)**:  \n- Next turn from (2,8): possible moves: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), RIGHT (3,8), LEFT (1,8).  \n  - Check each:  \n    - UP (2,9): safe unless enemy moves there.  \n    - DOWN (2,7): safe (not my body next turn? Let\u2019s compute my body after eating apple: head (2,8), old head (3,8) becomes second segment, rest shift. So (2,7) not in my body).  \n    - RIGHT (3,8): would be moving into my second segment (old head) \u2192 suicide.  \n    - LEFT (1,8): safe.  \nSo from (2,8), UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe (RIGHT suicide). That\u2019s 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 8)**:  \n- Next turn from (4,8): possible moves: UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), LEFT (3,8), RIGHT (5,8).  \n  - RIGHT (5,8): safe.  \n  - DOWN (4,7): safe? My body after growth: head (4,8), second segment (3,8), third (3,7), etc. So (4,7) not in body.  \n  - UP (4,9): safe.  \n  - LEFT (3,8): suicide (into second segment).  \nSo from (4,8), UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (LEFT suicide). That\u2019s 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5) Apple proximity**  \n\nAll three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) eat an apple immediately. So equal immediate reward.  \n\n---\n\n**6) Long-term positioning**  \n\nEnemy is at (7,7) and is long. I want to avoid getting trapped.  \n- UP (3,9): puts me on top edge, only 2 moves next turn, could be risky if enemy approaches.  \n- LEFT (2,8): central, 3 moves next turn, near many apples left side.  \n- RIGHT (4,8): central, 3 moves next turn, near many apples right side.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because enemy is on right side (7,7), so moving LEFT might give more space away from enemy. Also, from (2,8), I can access apples at (1,8), (0,4), (0,6), etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2,8), I\u2019ll have length 8. Next turn from (2,8), avoid RIGHT into (3,8) (suicide). Prefer DOWN/LEFT/UP to gather more apples while staying clear of enemy\u2019s likely path. Enemy may go UP toward (8,9) apple or LEFT toward (6,7).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

This puts me in the top row.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 7):** DEATH (Backwards into body).\n    *   **LEFT (6, 8):** SAFE. This is an **APPLE**. Snake #1 is at (2, 8) and might head toward (3, 8/9/7), but I am 4 units away from its current head.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 8):** SAFE. This is an **APPLE**.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (2, 8). It just ate an apple at (2, 8). \n    *   Its options: UP (2, 9), DOWN (2, 7), LEFT (1, 8 - Apple), RIGHT (3, 8 - Body/Death).\n    *   Snake #1 is constrained but likely to head LEFT for the apple at (1, 8). It is not an immediate threat to my current position.\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis & Strategy:**\n    *   Closest Apples: (6, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT (8, 8)**: I eat an apple. From there, I can move UP to (8, 9) to eat another apple. This keeps me on the edge of the board, which is safer given my length.\n    *   If I move **LEFT (6, 8)**: I eat an apple. However, this moves me closer to Snake #1 and toward the center where my own body is already quite coiled.\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   My body is currently snaking through the middle-right. By moving to the x=8 and x=9 columns, I stay in relatively clear space.\n    *   The tail is at (5, 1), so the body is quite long. I need to ensure I don't trap myself. Moving to the right wall (x=8, 9) provides a clear path up or down the side.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (8, 8) to secure that apple. Next turn, I will move UP to (8, 9) to secure another. This path keeps me away from Snake #1 and utilizes the open space on the right edge of the board. After clearing the top-right, I will evaluate the path toward (9, 0) or (8, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Yes  \n- Into own body? No (body doesn\u2019t have (2, 9))  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body list doesn\u2019t include (2, 9)  \n- Apple at (2, 9)? No (apples list doesn\u2019t show (2, 9))  \n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 7)**  \n- On board? Yes  \n- Into own body? No (body doesn\u2019t have (2, 7))  \n- Into enemy body? No  \n- Apple? No  \n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 8)**  \n- On board? Yes  \n- Into own body? No  \n- Into enemy body? No  \n- Apple? Yes (1, 8) is in apples list \u2192 would eat apple, grow by 1.  \n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8)**  \n- On board? Yes  \n- Into own body? Yes! (3, 8) is my second segment \u2192 immediate death \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo only UP, DOWN, LEFT are physically safe.  \n\n**5) Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head at (7, 8) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 9)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 7) (occupied by its own body) \u2192 illegal for enemy  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 8)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8)  \n\nMy safe moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 9) vs enemy possible moves (7, 9), (6, 8), (8, 8) \u2192 no overlap.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 7) vs enemy possible moves \u2192 no overlap.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 8) vs enemy possible moves \u2192 no overlap.  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn regardless of enemy choice.  \n\n**6) Future mobility after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (2, 9)**  \nNext turn from (2, 9):  \nPossible moves: DOWN (2, 8), LEFT (1, 9), RIGHT (3, 9).  \n- DOWN (2, 8): will be empty next turn (since I moved from it, and I didn\u2019t eat apple so tail moves). Actually, if I don\u2019t eat apple this turn, my tail moves from (4, 3) to (4, 4)? Wait, my body length stays same, so tail moves forward: old tail (4, 3) disappears, new tail is (4, 4)? Let\u2019s check: if no apple eaten, my body shifts: new head (2, 9), second segment = old head (2, 8), third = old second (3, 8), \u2026 last segment = old second-to-last (4, 4). So (2, 8) will be my second segment next turn. So DOWN from (2, 9) \u2192 (2, 8) would be suicide.  \n- LEFT (1, 9): safe if not occupied by enemy then.  \n- RIGHT (3, 9): safe if not occupied.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 7)**  \nNext turn from (2, 7):  \nPossible moves: UP (2, 8), DOWN (2, 6), LEFT (1, 7), RIGHT (3, 7).  \n- UP (2, 8): would be my second segment (old head) \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (2, 6): safe (not in my body next turn).  \n- LEFT (1, 7): safe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 7): my third segment next turn? Let\u2019s compute: new head (2, 7), second = (2, 8), third = (3, 8), fourth = (3, 7). So (3, 7) is my fourth segment \u2192 suicide.  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT \u2192 only 2 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 8)** (eat apple)  \nNext turn from (1, 8):  \nBody after growth: head (1, 8), second = old head (2, 8), third = (3, 8), fourth = (3, 7), fifth = (3, 6), sixth = (4, 6), seventh = (4, 5), eighth = (4, 4), ninth = (4, 3) (new tail).  \nPossible moves: UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), LEFT (0, 8), RIGHT (2, 8).  \n- RIGHT (2, 8): my second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- UP (1, 9): safe if not enemy.  \n- DOWN (1, 7): safe (not in my body).  \n- LEFT (0, 8): safe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**7) Apple proximity and strategy**  \nLEFT gets an apple and gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \nUP and DOWN give no apple and only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (7, 8) near right side; moving LEFT keeps me away from it.  \n\n**8) Long-term plan**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1, 8) and eating apple (length 9), next turn avoid RIGHT into (2, 8). Consider moving DOWN to (1, 7) or LEFT to (0, 8) to collect more apples on left side (0, 4), (0, 6), etc., while staying clear of enemy\u2019s path.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

From there, I'll assess the top edge. If Snake #1 claims the apples at (1, 9) and (3, 9), I will turn RIGHT to (9, 9) and head down the x=9 column towards the apples at (8, 5), (8, 1), and (9, 0).

No.  \n   - Apple at (1, 9)? Yes \u2192 eating apple \u2192 length becomes 10, tail stays at (4, 3) (no shift).  \n   - Enemy possible moves from (8, 8): UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7), LEFT (7, 8) (occupied by its body), RIGHT (9, 8).  \n     No head-on collision risk with (1, 9).  \n   - Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (1, 7)**  \n   - On board: Yes  \n   - In my body next turn?

Yes, (2, 8) is my second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n   - Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (1, 9) and eat apple**  \nNew length 10, body: head (1, 9), second = (1, 8), third = (2, 8), \u2026, tail = (4, 3).  \nNext turn possible moves from (1, 9):  \n- DOWN (1, 8) \u2192 my second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (0, 9) \u2192 safe if not enemy.  \n- RIGHT (2, 9) \u2192 safe if not enemy.  \nOnly 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**DOWN to (1, 7) no apple**  \nBody shifts: head (1, 7), second = (1, 8), third = (2, 8), \u2026, tail = (4, 4).  \nNext turn possible moves from (1, 7):  \n- UP (1, 8) \u2192 second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (1, 6) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (0, 7) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 7) \u2192 safe (not in new body).  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**LEFT to (0, 8) no apple**  \nBody shifts: head (0, 8), second = (1, 8), third = (2, 8), \u2026, tail = (4, 4).  \nNext turn possible moves from (0, 8):  \n- UP (0, 9) \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 7) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (1, 8) \u2192 second segment \u2192 suicide.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple collection strategy:**  \nUP gives me an apple (score 9), but reduces next turn\u2019s options to 2.  \nDOWN gives no apple but gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT gives no apple and only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\nEnemy is at (8, 8), far away. No immediate head-on risk.  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (8 vs 14), so collecting apples is important.  \n\nBut UP\u2019s next turn mobility is poor (only 2 moves). However, after eating apple at (1, 9), I could go LEFT to (0, 9) or RIGHT to (2, 9) next turn. Both are likely safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\nLet\u2019s check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8, 8): UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7), LEFT (7, 8) blocked, RIGHT (9, 8).  \nSo enemy won\u2019t be near (0, 9) or (2, 9) next turn.  \n\nBut maybe DOWN is better: keeps more options open and I can target apples at (0, 6), (0, 4) later.  \n\nHowever, apple at (1, 9) is very close and may be taken by enemy later if I skip it.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP and eat apple (1, 9), next turn I\u2019ll have only LEFT (0, 9) and RIGHT (2, 9) safe. Choose based on enemy position then.  \nIf I go DOWN, I keep more flexibility to go towards (0, 6) apple later.  \nGiven my apple deficit, eating now is good, but being trapped next turn is risky.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check: after UP to (1, 9), next turn if I go LEFT to (0, 9), then turn after that from (0, 9): possible moves DOWN (0, 8) (my old body? depends), LEFT off board, RIGHT (1, 9) (my old head), so might be very constrained.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN now for flexibility, then aim for apple at (0, 6) or (0, 4) soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

That will give growth and keep options open. Avoid trapping myself in top-left corner later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

However, moving into (6, 8) puts me in a tighter spot between my body segments at (7, 8) and (5, 8) isn't occupied, but (6, 6) is below. Actually, (6, 8) is quite safe, but (5, 9) keeps more long-term freedom.\n    *   **UP (6, 10):** **DEATH** (Out of bounds).\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (0, 6). It is currently pinned against the left wall. It can move UP (0, 7), DOWN (0, 5), or RIGHT (1, 6 - Death). It is quite far from me.\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis & Strategy:**\n    *   Directly ahead on the current row (y=9) are apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9).\n    *   Apples at (6, 8) and (4, 8) are nearby.\n    *   My body is currently occupying a lot of the right-hand side of the board. By moving LEFT, I'm heading into the more open left side of the board.\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Both LEFT and DOWN are safe.\n    *   **LEFT** is preferred because it maintains the momentum along the top wall, heading toward the apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9) while keeping the center of the board open for maneuvering later. Taking the apple at (6, 8) by moving DOWN is possible, but staying high (y=9) is a cleaner path that avoids getting \"tucked\" into my own body coils for now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT along the y=9 row to collect apples at (3, 9) and (1, 9). This path is clear and keeps me away from the current body tangle. Once those are collected, I will pivot down the x=0 or x=1 column to sweep the apples on the left side (0, 4) and the bottom-left corner clusters. I must monitor Snake #1's ascent; if they continue UP, we might meet near (0, 9).\n\nLEFT",

Both far from me.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (0, 4)** \u2013 eat apple \u2192 grow to length 11, tail stays same (no tail pop).  \nNext turn from (0, 4):  \n- UP (0, 5) \u2192 my new second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (0, 3) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT (1, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT).  \nAlso apple at (0,0) further down, but need to be careful not to trap myself in left column.\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 5)** \u2013 no apple eaten, tail pops (4,6 disappears).  \nNext turn from (1, 5):  \n- UP (1, 6) \u2192 my old second segment? Let\u2019s check: after moving RIGHT, body becomes [(1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6)] \u2192 (1,6) is fourth segment \u2192 occupied \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (1, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (0, 5) \u2192 second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 safe.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, RIGHT). Similar mobility but no apple now.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nDOWN gets apple immediately, growing to 11, bringing me closer to 30-apple win condition. It also keeps mobility options similar to RIGHT. Eating apple also means my tail doesn\u2019t advance, which could be useful if I want to keep my body shape for future moves.\n\n**Risk of collision:**  \nEnemy is far away at (5,9), no overlap possible this turn. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nTake apple at (0,4) now, then next turn likely go DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4) depending on board state. Avoid going up into my own body. Start working toward other apples like (2,2) or (3,2) by moving right after getting out of left column. Keep enemy\u2019s long body in mind\u2014it\u2019s mostly on right side, so left side is safer for now.\n\nDOWN",

Moves onto an apple.\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 9):** **DEATH** (Backwards into body).\n    *   **DOWN (4, 8):** **SAFE**. Moves onto an apple.\n    *   **UP (4, 10):** **DEATH** (Out of bounds).\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (0, 4). Valid moves: UP (0, 5 - Body/Death), DOWN (0, 3 - Safe), LEFT (-1, 4 - Out/Death), RIGHT (1, 4 - Safe).\n    *   It is currently far from my head and trapped against the left wall. It cannot immediately interfere with me.\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis & Strategy:**\n    *   I have two immediate apples: (3, 9) by moving LEFT and (4, 8) by moving DOWN.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (3, 9) is better because it keeps me on the perimeter (y=9). If I move DOWN to (4, 8), I am moving into a space more constrained by my own body and Snake #1's body at (4, 6) and (3, 6).\n    *   After taking (3, 9), the next target is (1, 9).\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   **LEFT (3, 9)** is highly favorable. It increases score and size while maintaining a path along the top edge of the board.\n    *   I must be careful not to get \"boxed in\" at the top-left corner by my own growing body, but since there are no obstacles at (3, 8) or (2, 9), I have sufficient escape routes.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (3, 9) then (1, 9). From (1, 9), I will evaluate whether to drop down for (0, 0) or snake back across to clear (4, 8) and (6, 8). I am currently leading and should prioritize safe growth.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy body doesn\u2019t include (1,3).  \n   - Safe unless enemy head moves there \u2014 enemy head at (3,9), unlikely in one move.  \n   - So DOWN is *potentially* safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** (0, 4):  \n   - Inside board: yes.  \n   - Own body? Yes \u2014 (0,4) is the second segment of my snake (directly behind head). That\u2019s moving backwards into my own body \u2192 immediate death.  \n   - So LEFT is **not safe**.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (2, 4):  \n   - Inside board: yes.  \n   - Not in own body?

Enemy body doesn\u2019t have (2,4).  \n   - Safe unless enemy head moves there \u2014 enemy head at (3,9) can\u2019t reach (2,4) in one move (needs distance 1 in x and 5 in y, impossible).  \n   - So RIGHT is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Apples nearby:**  \nApples at: (0,0),(6,8),(4,8),(3,0),(9,0),(1,9),(5,0),(3,2),(8,5),(7,5),(8,1),(7,1),(2,2),(6,2),(8,7).  \n\nFrom (1,4):  \n- UP (1,5): no apple.  \n- DOWN (1,3): no apple.  \n- RIGHT (2,4): no apple.  \n\nNo immediate apple in any safe move.  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety / options:**  \nLet\u2019s look at each safe move\u2019s next possible moves:\n\n- **UP to (1,5)**:  \n  Next from (1,5): UP (1,6) in own body \u2192 no. DOWN (1,4) empty? That\u2019s current head position, will be empty after move (tail moves later). LEFT (0,5) in own body \u2192 no. RIGHT (2,5) empty. So from (1,5) only DOWN and RIGHT possible (2 options).  \n\n- **DOWN to (1,3)**:  \n  Next from (1,3): UP (1,4) empty, DOWN (1,2) empty, LEFT (0,3) empty, RIGHT (2,3) empty. All 4 moves possible next turn. Better future mobility.\n\n- **RIGHT to (2,4)**:  \n  Next from (2,4): UP (2,5) empty, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) empty. All 4 moves possible next turn. Also good mobility.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT give best future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake head at (3,9) possible moves:** UP (3,10) off board \u2192 no. DOWN (3,8) \u2014 that\u2019s in my body (3,8) yes, so enemy would die if they go there. LEFT (2,9) empty. RIGHT (4,9) in enemy body \u2192 no. So enemy\u2019s only safe move is LEFT to (2,9).  \n\nThat means enemy will be at (2,9) next turn.  \n\nGiven enemy going to (2,9), my DOWN to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,4) are both safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term:**  \nI need apples \u2014 I have 10 vs enemy 16. Apples at (2,2), (3,2) are closest to (1,3) if I go DOWN. From (2,4) apples at (2,2) are also close.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (1,3) \u2192 next turn can go DOWN to (1,2) then LEFT to (0,2) etc., or RIGHT to (2,3) then DOWN to (2,2) apple.  \n\nGoing RIGHT to (2,4) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (2,3) then DOWN to (2,2) apple, same distance but more central.  \n\nBut enemy at (2,9) is far from (2,2) for now.  \n\nI think DOWN gives slightly more space on board (bottom left area open). Right now board top right is crowded with enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,3), head toward (2,2) apple via (2,3) or (1,2). Keep away from enemy path toward (1,9) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN gives open space and all future options.  \n\nDOWN",

It is far from me but potentially blocking my path downward on the left side.\n    *   Its available moves: DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2). UP (1, 3) is its body.\n    *   Snake #1 is near several apples (2, 2), (3, 2), and (0, 0).\n\n4.  **Apple Analysis & Strategy:**\n    *   I just consumed the apple at (1, 9), so I am now length 18.\n    *   The nearest apples are quite far below: (3, 5), (0, 0), (3, 2), etc.\n    *   The path down the 0-column is currently blocked by Snake #1's body at (0, 4), (0, 5), and (0, 6).\n    *   The path down the 1-column is blocked by Snake #1's body at (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 8).\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 9)** is the only available safe move this turn.\n    *   After moving to (0, 9), my only safe move next turn will likely be DOWN to (0, 8), provided Snake #1's body segments have cleared or are not in the way.\n    *   I must Wait for Snake #1's tail to move out of the way on the left side of the board to descend toward the bottom-row apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 9). Then, prepare to move DOWN along the 0-column as the enemy snake's body clears. This keeps me along the edge and away from the center mass of my own body. I will aim for the apples at (0, 0) and (3, 0) once the path is clear.\n\nLEFT",

Its safe moves:  \n- UP off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (1, 8): occupied by own body (segment after head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (0, 9): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 9): occupied by own body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo enemy will likely move LEFT to (0, 9), away from us. No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (2, 2) right next to us. Eating it grows us to length 11.  \nOther nearby apples: (0, 0), (3, 2), (3, 0), (5, 0), etc.  \n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **RIGHT to (2, 2)** \u2013 eat apple, new head at apple cell. Next turn safe moves from (2, 2):  \n   - UP to (2, 3): empty, safe.  \n   - DOWN to (2, 1): empty, safe.  \n   - LEFT to (1, 2): occupied by our old head (now body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n   - RIGHT to (3, 2): apple, safe.  \n   So 3 safe moves after eating apple, good mobility.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 1)** \u2013 no apple. Next turn safe moves from (1, 1):  \n   - UP to (1, 2): occupied by our old head (now body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n   - DOWN to (1, 0): empty, safe.  \n   - LEFT to (0, 1): empty, safe.  \n   - RIGHT to (2, 1): empty, safe.  \n   3 safe moves, but delays apple.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 2)** \u2013 no apple.

This turn: RIGHT to (2, 2) to eat apple.  \n2. Next turn: consider RIGHT to (3, 2) for another apple, or DOWN/UP to stay safe and approach other apples.  \n3. Keep an eye on enemy at top-left; they are far for now, but they may come down later. Focus on bottom-left apple cluster to close the gap.  \n\nRIGHT",

The 0-column is gradually opening up as Snake #1 moves toward the right/bottom apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed DOWN the 0-column. This allows me to bypass my own body segment trail and navigate toward the concentrated apple area at the bottom. I must monitor Snake #1's head at (2, 2) to ensure I don't get trapped in the bottom-left corner if it decides to pin me against the wall.\n\nDOWN",

Need to eat quickly.  \nClosest apples: (3,0), (6,2), (5,0).  \n\nFrom (3,2), DOWN gets me to (3,1), then DOWN to (3,0) apple next turn. That\u2019s fast growth.  \nRIGHT gets me to (4,2), then RIGHT to (5,2), then RIGHT to (6,2) apple in 2 moves total.  \n\nBut DOWN to (3,1) also keeps option to go RIGHT to (4,1) then to (5,0) apple after.  \n\nI think DOWN is best: gets me closer to two apples ((3,0) and (5,0)) while keeping board open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Danger check:**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,1), could enemy head move to (1,8) or (0,7)? They\u2019re far, no collision.  \nMy own body is mostly top-left, so (3,1) is clear.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (3,1).  \n2. Next turn: From (3,1), likely DOWN to (3,0) to eat apple, unless enemy threatens, then maybe RIGHT to (4,1) to avoid dead-end later.  \n3. After eating (3,0), consider moving toward (5,0) or (6,2).

However, because snakes move simultaneously, the segment at (0, 6) will move to (0, 5) this turn. **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 is currently at (3, 1). Its body is curled through columns 0, 1, and 2.\n    *   Snake #1\u2019s tail is at (2, 8).

Survival is the priority.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue the descent down the 0-column (0, 6 -> 0, 5 -> 0, 4). Once I reach (0, 3) or (0, 2), I can look for a gap in Snake #1's tail to move toward the center and clear my own tail's pathing. Avoid getting pinned against the bottom left corner if Snake #1 turns back toward me.\n\nDOWN",

Not safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 0): apple present, empty otherwise. Safe (not body, not enemy body).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 1): empty ('.'), safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 1): empty ('.'), safe.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check enemy possible moves & head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (0, 7), body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), \u2026, (5, 5)].  \nFrom (0, 7), enemy can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 8): enemy's own body segment. Not safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 6): empty ('.'), safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board. Not safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 7): empty ('.'), safe.  \n\nEnemy will likely choose DOWN or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 7), they are still far from my possible moves (3,0), (2,1), (4,1).  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0, 6), also far.  \nNo risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n- DOWN (3, 0): apple directly there \u2192 immediate growth.  \n- LEFT (2, 1): no immediate apple, but could go to (3,0) later or toward (0,0) apple.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1): no immediate apple, but opens path to (5,0) apple or (6,2) apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n**DOWN to (3, 0)**: eat apple \u2192 body grows, new head at apple. From (3, 0): UP (3, 1) will be my neck (body after move), so blocked; LEFT (2, 0) empty; RIGHT (4, 0) empty; DOWN off board \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, but I\u2019ll have eaten apple. Risk of being near bottom edge with limited moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 1)**: From (2, 1): UP (2, 2) my body (no), DOWN (2, 0) empty, LEFT (1, 1) empty, RIGHT (3, 1) will be my neck (blocked) \u2192 2 safe moves next turn. Not great mobility.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 1)**: From (4, 1): UP (4, 2) empty, DOWN (4, 0) empty, LEFT (3, 1) neck (blocked), RIGHT (5, 1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn. Good mobility, leads toward apples (5,0) and (6,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic plan:**  \nEnemy has 17 apples vs my 12. Need to catch up.  \nEating apple now (DOWN) gives growth but reduces next-turn safe moves to 2. Could trap me near bottom edge.  \nRIGHT gives better mobility and still lets me get (5,0) or (6,2) soon.  \nLEFT seems worse mobility.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s long body mostly top rows, staying flexible in center-right seems wise.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,1) keeps options open, avoids trapping myself at bottom.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Danger check:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4,1), enemy could be at (1,7) or (0,6) \u2013 far away, no collision risk. My body doesn\u2019t block (4,1). Safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: RIGHT to (4,1).  \n2. Next turn: From (4,1), likely DOWN to (4,0) then RIGHT to (5,0) apple, or RIGHT to (5,1) then DOWN to (5,0).  \n3. After eating (5,0), consider (6,2) or (9,0) later. Avoid moving toward top-left where my body is coiled.  \n\nRIGHT",
