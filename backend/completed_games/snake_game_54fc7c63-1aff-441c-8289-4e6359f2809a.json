That\u2019s fine.\n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n- RIGHT: next turn head at (1,1), body at (0,1). From (1,1), can go UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0), RIGHT (2,1), LEFT (0,1) but (0,1) is my body next turn so not safe unless I grow more. So 3 safe moves next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \n- UP: next turn head at (0,2), body at (0,1). From (0,2), can go UP (0,3), RIGHT (1,2), LEFT invalid (off board), DOWN (0,1) is body \u2192 so 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- DOWN: next turn head at (0,0), body at (0,1). From (0,0), can go RIGHT (1,0), UP (0,1) is body \u2192 so only 1 safe move next turn (DOWN leads off board, LEFT off board) \u2192 risky.\n\nSo DOWN is less favorable due to fewer future options.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nRIGHT gets apple, more future options (3 vs 2).  \nEarly growth is advantageous.\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT is safe, gets apple, and keeps good future mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (1,1), avoid going back into (0,1) unless necessary. Prefer moving toward center to have more space.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s okay for now.  \n\n- **LEFT** to (8, 1):  \n  Next turn, head at (8, 1), body at (9, 1).  \n  From (8, 1), possible moves: UP (8, 2), DOWN (8, 0), LEFT (7, 1), RIGHT (9, 1) (body).  \n  That\u2019s 3 safe moves next turn, more flexible, but no apple now.  \n\n- **DOWN** to (9, 0):  \n  Next turn, head at (9, 0), body at (9, 1).  \n  From (9, 0), possible moves: UP (9, 1) (body), LEFT (8, 0), RIGHT off board, DOWN off board.  \n  So only LEFT is safe next turn \u2192 very risky, could trap me.  \n\nSo DOWN is risky for future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**  \n\nUP gets an apple immediately, safe now, and next turn still has 2 safe moves.  \nLEFT is safe now and gives 3 safe moves next turn, but delays apple.  \n\nGiven early game, eating apples quickly is good, and UP is safe.  \nAlso, enemy might move toward (1, 1) apple, so race for apples is fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (9, 2), avoid going DOWN into body, choose LEFT or UP depending on enemy position.

Not really \u2014 they\u2019d need to go (4, 3) then (4, 4) or (4, 3) then (4, 5) in two moves; I\u2019d be at (4, 4) and could go UP to (4, 5) before they get there unless they go (5, 4) \u2192 (4, 4) in two moves, which would be head-on next turn if I\u2019m still at (4, 4).  \n\nActually, if enemy goes UP to (5, 4) this turn, then next turn from (5, 4) they could go LEFT to (4, 4) \u2014 that\u2019s where I would be if I go LEFT now. That\u2019s a possible head-on collision next turn if I stay at (4, 4) and they move there.  \n\nSo LEFT now \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 risk next turn if enemy goes (5, 3) \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 (4, 4).  \nIf I go UP now \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 next turn enemy at (5, 4) could go UP to (5, 5) too? That\u2019s where I\u2019d be if I don\u2019t move \u2014 but I will move next turn.  \n\nBetter to avoid being in a position where enemy can easily collide next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose safer path:**  \nUP to (5, 5) avoids being adjacent to enemy horizontally this turn (enemy at (5, 3), I\u2019d be at (5, 5)), so less chance of head-on next turn.  \nFrom (5, 5) next turn, I can go LEFT to (4, 5) to eat apple, and enemy would need two moves to reach (4, 5) from (5, 3) via (5, 4) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 5) or (5, 4) \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) etc.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes UP to (5, 4) this turn, then next turn from (5, 4) they could go UP to (5, 5) if I\u2019m still there \u2014 but I won\u2019t be, I\u2019ll move to (4, 5) to eat apple.

From (3, 3), I can go to (2, 3) toward apple (1, 1) or (2, 4) later.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer (length 4 vs my length 2 after eating apple), head-on collision is fatal for both, so I should avoid being adjacent to enemy head next turn if possible.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat apples safely, avoid confrontations until I\u2019m longer. Short-term: DOWN to (3, 3) seems safer because it keeps distance from enemy head and leaves options open (LEFT to apple (2, 4) next turn if enemy moves away). Moving LEFT now risks enemy moving adjacent and forcing me into a corner next turn.  \n\nDOWN",

After enemy moves, (3,4) becomes tail and will move if enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple. Enemy length 2, so if enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple, tail moves away and (3,4) becomes empty. So (3,4) could be empty next turn. But if enemy eats apple, (3,4) stays as body. Hard to know. Safer to treat as possibly occupied. Let\u2019s check: enemy can eat apple only if it moves to (2,3) (apple at (1,1) far, (2,4) is where I might go, (5,8),(7,8),(9,0) far). So enemy won\u2019t eat apple this turn unless it goes to (2,3) and apple at (1,1) is not reached. So (3,4) likely empty next turn. Still, RIGHT (3,4) is risky if enemy\u2019s tail stays.

Eating (2,4) extends my lead safely. Enemy cannot reach (2,4) this turn (enemy at (3,3), moves to (2,3) max, not (2,4)). So DOWN is safe this turn and gets apple. After eating, my body extends, so next turn my tail end is at (5,5) still, but new segment added after head moves to (2,4) \u2013 so body becomes [(2,4),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)].  \n\nFrom (2,4) next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,3) or LEFT to (1,4) to continue toward (1,1) or other apples.  \n\nGiven safety this turn and apple benefit, DOWN is best.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN to eat apple, grow, and maintain lead.  \n\nDOWN",

If enemy goes LEFT to (1,1) this turn, then next turn (1,1) would be enemy head, not safe for me. Wait \u2014 careful: enemy moves same turn as me. If enemy goes to (1,1) now, then (1,1) is occupied by enemy head at end of this turn. If I go DOWN to (1,2) now, next turn I could go DOWN to (1,1) and collide with enemy head? No \u2014 next turn enemy will move away from (1,1) possibly, but if it stays, I\u2019d die. So (1,1) next turn is risky if enemy is there now. Let\u2019s check:  \nEnemy at (2,1) \u2192 can go to (1,1) this turn. If it does, then at start of next turn enemy head is at (1,1). Then if I\u2019m at (1,2) and go DOWN to (1,1), I die. So (1,1) is unsafe next turn if enemy goes there now.  \nSo from (1,2) next turn safe moves:  \n- LEFT (0,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,2): empty if enemy not there. Enemy could be at (2,2) if it goes UP this turn. So (2,2) also risky.  \nSo DOWN gives maybe 1 safe move (LEFT) if enemy blocks both (1,1) and (2,2).  \n\n**LEFT to (0,3):**  \nFrom (0,3):  \n- UP (0,4): my body next turn \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (0,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (-1,3): off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (1,3): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSafe next moves: DOWN only.  \n\n**RIGHT to (2,3):**  \nFrom (2,3):  \n- UP (2,4): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (2,2): possibly enemy there next turn if enemy goes UP this turn.  \n- LEFT (1,3): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (3,3): empty.  \nSafe next moves: RIGHT only, maybe DOWN if enemy not at (2,2).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (1,1). DOWN moves toward it, but risky if enemy also going there.  \nLEFT and RIGHT move away from it.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy likely to go LEFT to (1,1) to eat apple (it\u2019s length 2, apple at (1,1) is close). If enemy goes to (1,1), then:  \n- If I go DOWN to (1,2), next turn I have only LEFT safe (since (1,1) enemy head, (2,2) possibly empty).  \n- If I go LEFT to (0,3), safe but far from apples.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (2,3), safe but far from apples.  \n\nBut if enemy goes UP to (2,2) instead, then (1,1) free next turn.  \n\nGiven enemy length 2, it might prioritize apple. But also it might avoid my longer snake.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have 4 apples vs enemy 1 apple. I can play safe, avoid head-on risk.  \nGoing DOWN risks next turn being trapped if enemy at (1,1).  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT gives fewer options next turn but safer.  \nRIGHT to (2,3) then next turn RIGHT to (3,3) opens board center.  \n\n**Decision:** RIGHT \u2013 keeps distance from enemy, avoids possible head-on next turn, maintains options toward center.  \n\nRIGHT",

If enemy stays (goes LEFT or UP), (2,1) could be free next turn? Wait: enemy head at (1,1) can\u2019t stay, must move. So (2,1) will be enemy body segment next turn (since enemy length 3, tail moves forward). Actually enemy body currently [(2,1),(3,1)]; after enemy moves, tail advances, so (2,1) may become tail or disappear? Let\u2019s simulate: enemy moves, head goes new cell, each body segment shifts forward, last segment (old tail) is removed unless apple eaten. Enemy didn\u2019t eat apple this turn (no apple at new head position), so tail (3,1) disappears, (2,1) becomes new last segment. So (2,1) will be enemy body next turn. So DOWN to (2,1) next turn would hit enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (1,2): possible enemy head there this turn? Enemy could go UP to (1,2). If enemy goes there this turn, then next turn (1,2) is enemy head \u2192 I\u2019d die if I go LEFT. If enemy not there, (1,2) empty.

RIGHT moves toward (8,3) slightly. DOWN moves away from apples.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy likely to go UP to (1,2) to move toward center/open space. If enemy goes UP, then (1,2) occupied, making my DOWN\u2192LEFT risky next turn.  \nRIGHT gives more options next turn and avoids enemy path.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m longer (5 vs 3), can afford to play safe and maneuver toward apples on right side (8,3) or top (5,8,7,8). Avoid getting pinned near enemy.  \n\n**Decision:** RIGHT \u2013 maximizes next-turn options and moves toward apples while staying clear of enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\nFrom (2, 0):  \n- **UP** (2, 1): next turn options: UP (2, 2) safe; DOWN (2, 0) body unsafe; LEFT (1, 1) body unsafe; RIGHT (3, 1) safe. So two safe moves next turn \u2014 better flexibility.  \n- **RIGHT** (3, 0): next turn options: UP (3, 1) safe; DOWN off board unsafe; LEFT (2, 0) body unsafe; RIGHT (4, 0) safe. Also two safe moves next turn.  \n\nBoth give same immediate future flexibility.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nClosest apples: (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 3).  \n- UP (2, 1) moves me away from bottom-row apples but opens path to go around top later.  \n- RIGHT (3, 0) moves me directly toward bottom-row apples.  \n\nEnemy is at (4, 3) \u2014 if I go RIGHT to (3, 0), enemy could move DOWN to (4, 2), then LEFT to (3, 2), then DOWN to (3, 1) \u2014 but that\u2019s 3 turns away. Minimal risk.  \n\nRIGHT seems better for apple gathering.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 0), I can go UP or RIGHT depending on enemy position.  \n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\nFrom (2, 1):  \n- **UP** (2, 2): next turn options: UP (2, 3) safe? (2, 3) is empty? Wait \u2014 board shows T at (3, 3) but (2, 3) is empty. Yes, safe.

If I move DOWN to (2, 0), new body: head (2, 0), then (2, 1), then (3, 1) \u2014 tail (3, 0) disappears. So (3, 0) is free next turn. So RIGHT (3, 0) safe.

Wait: My snake: head (1,7), body [(1,8), (2,8)]. So tail is (2,8). That means my current tail is at (2,8), so (2,7) is empty. Let\u2019s verify: Board shows 'T T' at y=8, x=1,2. So (2,8) is my tail, (1,8) is my neck. So (2,7) is not my body. Check enemy: Snake #1 body includes (5,6), etc. So yes, (2,7) is empty. So RIGHT is actually safe.\n\nCorrection:  \nUP into (1,8) is my neck \u2014 NOT safe.  \nDOWN (1,6) safe.  \nLEFT (0,7) safe.  \nRIGHT (2,7) safe (empty per board; no snake#1 body\u2014they\u2019re at y=5,8, etc., far away).  \n\nSafe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Freedoms next turn:**\n- DOWN (1,6): next moves: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6).

Board shows (2,8) is my tail; if I don\u2019t eat apple, tail stays at (2,8) but head goes to (2,7), so (2,8) will be part of body when next turn head moves? Actually: If I move RIGHT to (2,7) and no apple eaten, tail stays at (2,8) temporarily, then next turn tail moves to (1,8), so (2,8) becomes empty next turn? Messy. Let\u2019s check: Tail logic \u2014 when you move without eating apple, tail shifts: head to (2,7), body becomes [(1,7),(1,8)], so at end of turn, snake is [(2,7),(1,7),(1,8)]. So (2,8) is empty next turn. So next turn from (2,7), up (2,8) empty \u2192 safe.

Then from (9,7) only DOWN to (9,6) (since LEFT (8,7) is body? Let\u2019s check: at that time, body will have shifted; but likely still blocked). That\u2019s a corridor down the right edge.  \n\nBoth are corridors but top row leftwards seems slightly better because:  \n- Top row leftwards eventually reaches (0,9) then can go DOWN toward apple (0,4).  \n- Right edge downwards goes toward apples (9,0) and (8,0) but also toward enemy possibly later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy is small and far away, not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (7,9) seems slightly better because it moves toward more open left side and eventually toward apple (0,4) via top-left path. RIGHT leads down right edge which is also okay but more limited.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (7,9), next turn only safe move is LEFT to (6,9).

Wait, scores say apples: 3, but board shows apple at (4,8) earlier. Now apple list doesn't have (4,8), so enemy ate it last turn and grew to length 4.)  \nApples: (9,0), (8,0), (7,3), (0,4), (0,3).  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety from (6,9):**  \n- UP (6,10): off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (6,8): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (5,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,9): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nOnly valid move: LEFT to (5,9).  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (4,8):**  \nEnemy can go:  \n- UP (4,9): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,7): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,8): its body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (5,8): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nValid: UP, DOWN.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy move: (5,9).  \nEnemy possible: (4,9), (4,7).  \nNo overlap \u2192 safe this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn safety after moving LEFT to (5,9):**  \nFrom (5,9):  \n- UP (5,10): off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (5,8): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (4,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,9): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nOnly valid: LEFT to (4,9).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Look ahead further:**  \nFrom (4,9):  \n- UP off board.  \n- DOWN (4,8): enemy's current head position, but enemy will move this turn. Next turn (4,8) will be empty unless enemy moves back into it, but enemy can't because from (4,9) or (4,7) they can't reach (4,8) in one move. So (4,8) will be empty next turn. But my body will trail behind me; tail moves forward each turn unless I eat apple. Currently length 10, no apple eaten now, so tail moves from (5,5) to (5,6) next turn. So (4,8) will be free next turn? Wait, my body after moving: head (5,9), body becomes [(6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6)], tail at (5,6). So (4,8) is empty next turn.  \nThus from (4,9) next turn, DOWN to (4,8) will be safe. That gives an option besides LEFT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nForced LEFT now to (5,9). Next turn forced LEFT to (4,9). Then at (4,9) I can go DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9).  \nGoing DOWN leads toward center and apples (7,3), (0,4), (0,3).  \nGoing LEFT continues along top row toward (0,9) then down left edge toward apples (0,4), (0,3).  \nEnemy is at (4,8) now but will move; if enemy goes UP to (4,9), that's where I'll be next turn \u2014 but that's a head-on collision? No, enemy moves this turn to (4,9) or (4,7). If enemy goes to (4,9) this turn, then next turn my head (5,9) and enemy head (4,9) are adjacent, possible collision next turn if we move toward each other. But enemy's valid moves from (4,9) next turn: UP off board, DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9) \u2014 RIGHT into my future head (5,9) would be collision if I stay at (5,9), but I'll move to (4,9) next turn, so no collision. Actually, if enemy is at (4,9) now (after this turn), and I'm at (5,9), then next turn I go to (4,9) and enemy could go to (5,9) \u2014 that's a head-on collision. So dangerous.  \n\nBut wait, enemy's possible moves this turn: UP (4,9) or DOWN (4,7). If enemy goes UP to (4,9), then next turn:  \nEnemy at (4,9), me at (5,9).  \nMy only move from (5,9) is LEFT to (4,9) \u2014 that's moving into enemy's head cell at same time enemy could move to (5,9) or elsewhere. If enemy chooses RIGHT to (5,9), we swap and both die. If enemy chooses DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9), I move into (4,9) while enemy leaves it \u2014 safe. So it's risky but not certain death.  \n\nBetter to avoid that risk entirely: if enemy goes UP to (4,9) this turn, I want to be not forced into (4,9) next turn. But I am forced: from (5,9) only LEFT to (4,9). So I can't avoid.  \n\nTherefore, I hope enemy goes DOWN to (4,7) this turn. That's safer for me.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nOnly one legal move: LEFT. Must take it and hope enemy doesn't go UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove LEFT to (4,9) next turn regardless. If enemy is at (4,9) then, my move into (4,9) could be safe if enemy moves away. If enemy stays (unlikely, they must move), collision. But they must move, so they'll leave (4,9) unless they go RIGHT to (5,9) \u2014 which would kill us both. So hope they go DOWN or LEFT from (4,9). Monitor next turn.  \n\nLEFT",

Next turn I\u2019ll decide based on enemy position.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,9), if enemy is at (4,8), consider LEFT to (3,9) to avoid possible collision risk.  \nIf enemy is not at (4,8), DOWN to (4,8) is fine.  \nKeep moving toward left-side apples via top row.  \n\nLEFT",

From (6,7), I can go UP then LEFT to (5,8) in two turns. From (5,6), I can go UP then UP/LEFT.  \nGoing DOWN (6,5) moves me away from (5,8) and into more crowded area near my body.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nIf enemy eats (8,0), its head will be at (8,0) next turn (if it moved DOWN) or at (9,1) if it moved RIGHT, or (8,2) if UP.  \nFrom (8,0), enemy could move UP to (8,1) (its own old head) \u2014 invalid, so it would have LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (off-board). So enemy likely won\u2019t go DOWN to (8,0) if it wants to survive next turn. Actually, if enemy goes DOWN to (8,0) and eats apple, next turn from (8,0) valid moves are UP (8,1) (body), LEFT (7,0) empty, RIGHT (9,0) apple. So it can survive. But it\u2019s not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN is risky (only 2 safe follow-ups).  \nUP and LEFT both give 3 safe follow-ups and keep me closer to (5,8).  \nUP to (6,7) is slightly closer to (5,8) (distance 2 vs 3) and opens path upward.  \nLEFT to (5,6) is also fine but might box me near left edge later.  \n\nBest choice: **UP** to (6,7) \u2014 closer to apple, good mobility, away from enemy\u2019s likely area.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,7), aim for (5,8) via UP to (6,8) then LEFT, or LEFT to (5,7) then UP. Watch enemy\u2019s new head position after it possibly eats (8,0). Avoid moving into my own body trail near left wall.  \n\nUP",

From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) eats it. From (5,7), moving UP to (5,8) eats it. Both are equally close.  \nBut from (6,8) I have more open space above (6,9) and right (7,8) after eating apple. From (5,7), after eating apple at (5,8), I\u2019ll be at (5,8) with body behind at (5,7) \u2014 possible constraints near left wall.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nIf enemy eats (9,0), its head will be at (9,0) next turn. From there, valid moves: UP (9,1) empty, LEFT (8,0) empty (its old head cell), DOWN off-board invalid, RIGHT off-board invalid. So it will be trapped on bottom row with only UP or LEFT. Not an immediate threat to me in upper area.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT is risky (only 2 safe follow-ups).  \nUP and LEFT both give 3 safe follow-ups and put me one step from (5,8).  \nUP to (6,8) gives slightly better post-apple mobility (access to right side and top).  \nLEFT to (5,7) also fine but may push me leftward into my own body trail.  \n\nBest choice: **UP** to (6,8) \u2014 sets up apple grab next turn with good escape routes.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,8), eat apple at (5,8) via LEFT unless enemy threatens. Then consider moving UP to (6,9) or RIGHT to (7,8) to avoid boxing in. Monitor enemy\u2019s position after it likely eats (9,0).  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s risky \u2014 I\u2019ll be moving left along bottom edge with only one option next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term thinking:**  \nFrom (5, 0) next turn:  \nPossible moves: UP (5, 1) body \u2718, DOWN off \u2718, LEFT (4, 0) body \u2718, RIGHT (6, 0) body \u2718 \u2192 no moves! That means if I go LEFT now, I\u2019ll be trapped and die in 2 turns.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check carefully:  \nMy body after moving LEFT: head (6, 0), body becomes [(7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0)] \u2014 tail (4, 0) is gone because I didn\u2019t eat an apple. Yes, so tail moves up.  \n\nSo body segments: (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0).  \n\nFrom (6, 0):  \n- UP (6, 1): body \u2718  \n- DOWN off \u2718  \n- LEFT (5, 0): body \u2718  \n- RIGHT (7, 0): body \u2718  \n\nOh no \u2014 all moves blocked! That means **LEFT is actually fatal next turn** \u2014 so I have no safe moves now? That can\u2019t be right unless I\u2019m missing something. Let\u2019s recheck:  \n\nCurrent body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0)]  \nMove LEFT to (6, 0): new body = [(6, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0)] \u2014 yes, tail (4, 0) gone.  \n\nFrom (6, 0):  \n- LEFT (5, 0): occupied by body \u2718  \n- RIGHT (7, 0): occupied by body \u2718  \n- UP (6, 1): occupied by body \u2718  \n- DOWN off board \u2718  \n\nIndeed, all moves blocked. So LEFT kills me next turn.  \n\nBut the rules say: \u201cnever choose a move that obviously kills you\u201d \u2014 killing you *next turn* isn\u2019t \u201cimmediately\u201d in the strict sense, but it\u2019s inevitable death, so effectively no safe moves exist.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe I made a mistake: Is (5, 0) in my body after moving LEFT? Yes \u2014 body list: (6, 0) head, then (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0). So (5, 0) is the tail. But tail moves only after I move without eating \u2014 so after next move, tail moves away from (5, 0)? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nTurn 58: move LEFT to (6, 0), body becomes: [(6, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0)] \u2014 tail (5, 0).  \n\nTurn 59: move LEFT to (5, 0) \u2014 oh, but (5, 0) is currently tail. If I move into tail, is that safe? Rule: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d Tail is part of body \u2014 so moving into (5, 0) kills me immediately. So yes, LEFT now leads to certain death next turn because my only move then is into my tail.  \n\nSo I have **no safe moves**? That seems wrong \u2014 maybe I mis-read the board. Let\u2019s check the board ASCII art:  \n\nRow 0: . . . . T T . 0 T A  \nAt (6, 0) is \u2018T\u2019 (my tail currently), but after I move LEFT to (6, 0), tail will be at (5, 0). So next turn from (6, 0), LEFT to (5, 0) is into my tail \u2014 death.  \n\nSo indeed, I\u2019m trapped. This means the game might end for me this turn if no move is safe. But I must check: maybe RIGHT is safe? RIGHT to (8, 0) is my body \u2014 death immediately. UP to (7, 1) is my body \u2014 death. DOWN off board \u2014 death. LEFT to (6, 0) \u2014 safe this turn, but next turn no escape.  \n\nGiven the rules, I must pick a move that doesn\u2019t kill me *this turn*. Only LEFT qualifies. So I pick LEFT even though it leads to death next turn \u2014 because the rules don\u2019t require avoiding future death beyond the immediate turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 0), only (5, 0) is free (tail), but moving into tail kills me. So no escape. Game will likely end next turn.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

So only RIGHT to (7,0) is valid. Enemy will be stuck moving between (6,0) and (7,0) until it starves. It\u2019s not a threat to me in upper half.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nEating apple at (5,8) grows me to 15, puts me near top-left area with open cells above and left. After eating, I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves next turn.  \nGoing RIGHT to (7,8) also gives 3 safe moves next turn but delays apple.  \nGiven enemy is stuck, securing apple now is safe and beneficial.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (5,8) eats apple, grows, keeps 3 safe follow-ups, and doesn\u2019t risk top-edge trap.  \nUP is risky (only 2 follow-ups).  \nRIGHT is safe but delays apple.  \n\nBest choice: **LEFT** to eat apple and maintain mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,8), choose among UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8) based on apple positions and space. Enemy is stuck on bottom row, so focus on collecting apples (0,4), (9,9), (1,1) while avoiding boxing myself.  \n\nLEFT",

(9,9) is closest but requires moving right/up. (0,4) is far left/down.  \nMoving DOWN to (4,7) gives more options next turn and moves me toward center/left side.  \nMoving LEFT to (3,8) also good options, but moves me away from (9,9) and not much closer to (0,4).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (4,7) gives same mobility as LEFT but positions me better to go toward (0,4) or (1,1) in future turns while keeping escape routes.

Moving LEFT gets me closer to (0,4).  \nRIGHT moves me toward right side where my body blocks some space, but also toward (9,1) and (9,0) eventually.  \nDOWN moves me toward bottom row where enemy is, but still safe for now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nAll three moves are equally safe next turn (2 options each).  \nI prefer LEFT to (3,6) because:  \n- It progresses toward (0,4), the closest apple.  \n- It avoids moving toward enemy\u2019s area (bottom row).  \n- It keeps me away from my own body cluster on the right side (6,6 to 7,6 etc.).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,6), consider DOWN or LEFT to continue toward (0,4) while monitoring enemy movement. Enemy may move up the left side (3,1) or center (4,2). Keep escape routes open and avoid being trapped near left wall.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, (3,7) is empty in board? Actually my body has (4,7) but not (3,7). Let\u2019s check board: row 7 col 3 is empty. But is it in my body list? No. So UP is free of my body.

Actually my body has (4,3),(4,4)? Wait, my body list shows (4,3) but not (4,4) or (4,5). So (4,5) is empty).  \nValid follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I go **LEFT to (2,6)**:  \nFrom (2,6):  \n- UP (2,7): empty.  \n- DOWN (2,5): empty.  \n- LEFT (1,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,6): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \nValid follow-ups: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT give 3 safe follow-ups, UP gives only 2.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nI want to eventually get (0,4). From (3,6):  \n- DOWN to (3,5) moves me closer in y (5 vs 4) but same x.  \n- LEFT to (2,6) moves me closer in x (2 vs 0) but same y.  \nBoth are progress.  \nEnemy is at (3,1) moving possibly UP toward center. If I go DOWN to (3,5), I\u2019m moving toward enemy\u2019s vertical line, which could be risky if enemy moves UP several times. If I go LEFT to (2,6), I\u2019m moving away horizontally.  \n\nAlso, my body occupies right side (columns 4-7), so staying left gives more space.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT have 3 safe follow-ups.  \nLEFT feels slightly better because:  \n- It moves toward apple (0,4) in x-direction.  \n- It avoids moving toward enemy\u2019s column.  \n- It keeps me near left wall but not trapped yet (still y=6, room to maneuver).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,6), continue toward (0,4) via LEFT or DOWN as needed, while watching enemy\u2019s movement up the left side.

Enemy currently at (2, 4) could move LEFT to (1, 4) this turn, so if I'm at (0, 4) next turn, enemy could be at (1, 4) next to me. But not collision unless we move into same cell.\n\nActually, check enemy's possible moves from (2, 4):  \nEnemy can go UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3), LEFT (1, 4), RIGHT (3, 4).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1, 4) this turn, then next turn from (1, 4) enemy could go LEFT to (0, 4) while I'm there \u2014 head-on collision possible. That's risky.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 3):**  \nFrom (1, 3):  \n- UP (1, 4): enemy body (1, 4) \u2014 \u2718  \n- DOWN (1, 2): my body \u2014 \u2718  \n- LEFT (0, 3): neck \u2014 \u2718  \n- RIGHT (2, 3): empty  \n\nSafe next moves: RIGHT only \u2014 risky (only 1 safe move).\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**  \nEnemy at (2, 4) might want apple at (0, 4). They can reach it in 2 moves: LEFT to (1, 4), then LEFT to (0, 4).  \nIf I go UP to (0, 4) this turn, enemy could go LEFT to (1, 4) this turn, then next turn we both could try to go to (0, 4) \u2014 head-on collision.  \nBut enemy has 14 apples vs my 8 \u2014 they have more to lose from head-on collision. They might avoid risky moves.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term:**  \nI need apples to catch up.  \nApple at (0, 4) is very close \u2014 taking it now puts me at 9 apples.  \nApple at (0, 9) is also reachable along top edge.  \nGoing RIGHT gives fewer options next turn (only RIGHT safe), which is dangerous.  \nGoing UP gives more options next turn (UP, RIGHT possibly safe depending on enemy).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP is slightly risky due to possible head-on collision next turn, but enemy likely avoids it. UP gets me an apple and opens more future moves. RIGHT leads to potential trap.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (0, 4), consider moving UP toward (0, 9) or RIGHT to avoid enemy, depending on enemy's position. Stay flexible.\n\nUP",

No overlap \u2192 safe for all my options.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (5,3) at distance |3-5|+|4-3| = 3.  \n(9,0), (9,1), (9,9), (0,9) are farther.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Next turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf I go **UP to (3,5)**:  \nFrom (3,5):  \n- UP (3,6): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (3,4): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (2,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,5): empty.  \nValid follow-ups: LEFT, RIGHT (2 safe).  \n\nIf I go **DOWN to (3,3)**:  \nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (3,2): empty.  \n- LEFT (2,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,3): empty, but (5,3) is apple.  \nValid follow-ups: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe).  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (4,4)**:  \nFrom (4,4):  \n- UP (4,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,3): empty.  \n- LEFT (3,4): my old head \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (5,4): empty.  \nValid follow-ups: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 safe).  \n\nDOWN and RIGHT both give 3 safe follow-ups. UP gives only 2.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple targeting and enemy path:**  \nEnemy will be at (0,5) next turn, likely heading toward (0,9) apple eventually.  \nApple at (5,3) is close if I go DOWN to (3,3), then RIGHT to (4,3), then RIGHT to (5,3) in two turns.  \nBut (5,3) is also reachable from (4,4) via DOWN then LEFT in two turns.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term positioning:**  \nMy length advantage (14 vs 9) means I can play safe and avoid being trapped.  \nMoving DOWN or RIGHT keeps me central. DOWN moves me toward bottom-left area where enemy isn\u2019t heading immediately. RIGHT moves me toward right side where three apples are later.  \n\nGiven enemy is going to (0,5), moving DOWN to (3,3) avoids being near enemy\u2019s future path (top-left). Also DOWN gives 3 safe follow-ups and positions me to grab (5,3) apple soon.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,3), consider moving RIGHT to (4,3) to approach apple (5,3), but check enemy\u2019s new position (0,5) and possible moves. Keep options open to go DOWN/LEFT if needed.  \n\nDOWN",

No overlap \u2192 safe for all my options.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (5,3) at distance 1 (RIGHT).
