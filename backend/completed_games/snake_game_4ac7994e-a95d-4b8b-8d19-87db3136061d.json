The enemy snake is at (0,1), so the immediate danger there is low. Prioritize apples that are accessible and allow you to grow safely while avoiding the enemy. Consider branching out to the right side of the board eventually to secure more apples and space, as the enemy is likely to focus on the left side initially.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n- Current Head: (5, 7)\n- Enemy Head: (0, 1)\n- Apples: (2,2), (4,0), (4,2), (3,3), (6,5), (1,6), (8,9), (7,3), (6,0), (4,3), (1,3), (0,8), (5,8), (7,7), (6,1)\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Up (5,8):** This square contains an apple (5,8). It is empty of obstacles.\n    -   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Future Safety:** From (5,8), I can go Up to (5,9) (safe), Left to (4,8) (safe), Right to (6,8) (safe), or Down to (5,7) (my previous body, which I am leaving, so safe). This provides excellent future options.\n    -   **Apple Value:** Gains 1 point immediately.\n\n2.  **Left (4,7):** Empty square.\n    -   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Future Safety:** From (4,7), I can go Up to (4,8) (safe), Left to (3,7) (safe), Right to (5,7) (previous body, safe), Down to (4,6) (safe).\n    -   **Apple Value:** No immediate apple.\n\n3.  **Right (6,7):** Empty square.\n    -   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Future Safety:** From (6,7), I can go Up to (6,8) (safe), Right to (7,7) (contains apple), Down to (6,6) (safe), Left to (5,7) (previous body, safe).\n    -   **Apple Value:** No immediate apple.\n\n4.  **Down (5,6):** Empty square.\n    -   **Immediate Safety:** Safe.\n    -   **Future Safety:** From (5,6), I can go Down to (5,5) (safe), Left to (4,6) (safe), Right to (6,6) (safe), Up to (5,7) (previous body, safe).\n    -   **Apple Value:** No immediate apple.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **Up** is the strongest move. It immediately collects an apple, which is the primary objective to win the game. It also maintains excellent mobility (4 free directions) and starts moving towards the cluster of apples in the upper part of the board (0,8, 5,8, 8,9). The enemy is at (0,1) and moving towards apples on the left side (e.g., (2,2), (4,0)), so moving Up/Right does not immediately threaten a head-on collision with the enemy, who is far away.\n-   Moving Left or Down is safe but doesn't yield points. Moving Right is safe but leaves an apple (5,8) behind when I could easily take it.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to (5,8) to collect the apple and position myself optimally for the next turn.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Based on the board state and game rules, I will analyze my possible moves for Turn 1. Note that I am currently at (5, 8) because my snake's head moved there in the last turn (as indicated by the \"Turn: 1 / 150\" header and the board state showing '0' at (5,8)). My previous body is now at (5, 7).\n\n**Analysis of Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid move within board. (5, 9) is empty on the board. My previous head was at (5, 8), so I am moving forward, not into my own body (which is now at (5, 7)).\n    *   **Outcome:** Empty space, no apple.\n    *   **Future State:** Head (5, 9), Body [(5, 8), (5, 7)].\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid move. However, (5, 7) is currently occupied by my own body segment (the tail from the previous turn).\n    *   **Outcome:** Moving into my own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Illegal move.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid move within board. (4, 8) is empty on the board. Moving away from my body at (5, 7).\n    *   **Outcome:** Empty space, no apple.\n    *   **Future State:** Head (4, 8), Body [(5, 8), (5, 7)]. Note that if I move LEFT, my body will be \"L\" shaped. From (4, 8), (5, 8) is occupied by my next body segment, and (4, 7) is empty. (3, 8) is empty. (4, 9) is empty. Mobility is good.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Valid move within board. (6, 8) is empty on the board. Moving away from my body at (5, 7).\n    *   **Outcome:** Empty space, no apple.\n    *   **Future State:** Head (6, 8), Body [(5, 8), (5, 7)]. Note that (5, 8) is occupied by my next body segment. (6, 7) is empty. (7, 8) is empty. (6, 9) is empty. Mobility is good.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe board shows a cluster of apples in the upper-left region: (0, 8) and (8, 9). The snake #1 is at (1, 1), far away and moving toward the bottom-left cluster (e.g., (2, 2), (4, 0)). My immediate goal is to maintain safe positioning while navigating toward the nearest accessible apples.\n\nFrom (5, 8):\n*   **UP** keeps me in the center column (x=5), which is open vertically but limits horizontal mobility to 4 or 6.\n*   **LEFT** moves me towards the left edge. From (4, 8), the apple at (0, 8) is reachable in 4 moves (4,8 -> 3,8 -> 2,8 -> 1,8 -> 0,8). The path appears clear based on the board state. This aligns with the goal of securing apples efficiently.\n*   **RIGHT** moves me towards the right edge. From (6, 8), the apple at (8, 9) is reachable. However, the path (6,8) -> (7,8) -> (8,8) -> (8,9) is slightly longer (3 moves) and pushes me into a corner (8,9). Corners are dangerous if an enemy approaches or if I need to reverse. (6,8) -> (7,8) -> (8,8) -> (8,9) leaves (8,9) as a potential dead-end if I cannot exit upwards (y=9 is top). In contrast, (0,8) is on the edge (x=0) but allows me to turn and go down or stay on the row.\n\nComparing **LEFT** and **UP**:\n*   **UP** (5,9): Safest, open space, but no immediate apple path. (5,9) -> (5,8) is blocked by my body immediately next turn if I don't grow.\n*   **LEFT** (4,8): Moves toward (0,8) apple. The path 4,8 -> 3,8 -> 2,8 -> 1,8 -> 0,8 is clear. The snake #1 is at (1,1) and moving towards apples like (2,2) or (4,0). He is unlikely to reach (0,8) or my path quickly. Moving Left gives me a clear trajectory to an apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (4, 8). This move is safe (valid coordinates, empty space, not into self) and positions me to collect the apple at (0, 8) in the next few turns while keeping the board open. It avoids the immediate trap of (5, 7) and maintains a central-ish position relative to the left-edge apple.\n\nLEFT",

My body is at (5, 8). This is a valid, safe move.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me to the top edge. While safe, it reduces my vertical options to DOWN only for the next turn. It keeps me away from the bottom-left cluster of apples where the enemy snake is likely heading. It also leaves the apple at (0, 8) accessible.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 7) is within the board and currently empty. My body is at (5, 8). This is a valid, safe move.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me back towards the center. From (4, 7), I can move LEFT towards (3, 7), which is adjacent to the apple at (4, 8) (wait, I am at 4,8). Actually, (4, 7) is directly below the apple at (4, 8). Wait, checking the board again:\n        *   Row 8: `A . . . 0 T . . . .` -> My head is at 4,8. The apple at (2, 2) is far. (4, 8) does *not* have an apple on the board state provided (Row 8 shows an apple at 0,8 and empty at 4,8). Wait, looking at the Apples list: `(2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (3, 3), (6, 5), (1, 6), (8, 9), (7, 3), (6, 0), (4, 3), (1, 3), (0, 8), (7, 7), (6, 1), (2, 4)`.\n        *   Apple at `(0, 8)` is directly to my LEFT.\n        *   Apple at `(2, 4)` is diagonally down-left.\n        *   Apple at `(4, 3)` is straight down.\n    *   **Conclusion:** (4, 7) is safe but doesn't grab an apple immediately. It opens up the bottom area.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 8) is within the board and currently empty (Row 8 shows `... 0 T ...`, so 3,8 is a dot). My body is at (5, 8).\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me closer to the apple at (0, 8). From (3, 8), the next step is (2, 8), then (1, 8), then (0, 8). This is a clear path. The enemy snake is at (1, 2) and likely moving towards the bottom-left apples (like (2, 2) or (4, 0)). He is not an immediate threat to the (0, 8) apple. This is a strong directional choice.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 8) is currently occupied by my own body segment (the tail from the previous turn).\n    *   **Outcome:** Moving into my own body. **Death.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Illegal move.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nBetween UP (4, 9) and LEFT (3, 8):\n*   **UP** takes me to the top edge, which can be a trap if I am forced to move left/right later and get stuck. It is safe but passive.\n*   **LEFT** moves me directly toward the apple at (0, 8). The path is clear: (3,8) -> (2,8) -> (1,8) -> (0,8). The enemy is far away and unlikely to interfere with this specific sequence. Moving Left increases my score and maintains a relatively open board (row 8 is mostly empty).\n\nI will move **LEFT** to (3, 8). This is the most active and rewarding move that avoids immediate danger.\n\nLEFT",

Therefore, my body is [(4, 8)].\n- **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    - **Head:** (2, 2)\n    - **Body:** [(1, 2)]\n    - **Strategy:** He is in the bottom-left area, far away from me.

A .`. (3, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Value:** Moves to the top edge. From there, I can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. It restricts my vertical movement. While safe, it doesn't advance me towards the (0, 8) apple as effectively as LEFT does. The apple at (8, 9) is far to the right, but I am currently moving towards (0, 8).\n\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (3, 7) is within bounds. Row 7 shows `. . . . . . . A . .`. (3, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Value:** Moves me away from the (0, 8) apple. I would have to come back up to get it.

It heads directly towards the apple at (0, 8) with a clear path. The enemy snake is nowhere near me. Staying on row 8 is safe and gives me room to maneuver. I should continue left until I reach (0, 8).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nContinue moving LEFT along row 8 to collect the apple at (0, 8). Monitor the enemy snake's position relative to the bottom-left apples, but focus on securing my own score first. After eating (0, 8), I will evaluate the next closest apple (likely (2, 4) or (4, 3)).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Based on the provided game state, here is the analysis:\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (1, 8)\n    *   **Body:** [(2, 8)]\n    *   **Apples:** 1\n    *   **Last Move:** LEFT (from (2, 8) to (1, 8)).\n    *   **Logic Check:** My previous move (LEFT) was incorrect based on the Turn 5 state. The board shows my head at (1, 8) and my body at (2, 8). If I moved LEFT on Turn 4 from (2, 8), I would have gone to (1, 8). This implies my previous turn's starting position was (2, 8). However, the \"Your last move information\" block states I moved LEFT from (3, 8). There is a contradiction here. I must trust the visual board state provided for Turn 5.\n    *   **Current Location:** (1, 8).\n    *   **Target:** Apple at (0, 8). It is immediately adjacent to the LEFT.\n\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   **Head:** (3, 3)\n    *   **Body:** [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)]\n    *   **Position:** Far away in the bottom-left quadrant. No immediate threat to my current position (1, 8).\n\n*   **Board Layout (Row 8):**\n    *   Visual: `A 0 T . . . . . . .`\n    *   Coordinates:\n        *   (0, 8): 'A' (Apple)\n        *   (1, 8): '0' (My Head)\n        *   (2, 8): 'T' (My Tail)\n        *   (3, 8): '.' (Empty)\n\n**Move Evaluation from (1, 8):**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 8) contains an apple. It is not a snake body segment. It is within bounds.\n    *   **Outcome:** I eat the apple. My body will grow. Since I ate an apple, my tail will *not* move forward this turn. The cell (2, 8) will remain part of my body.\n    *   **Future Position:** Head at (0, 8), Body at [(1, 8), (2, 8)].\n    *   **Status:** **Safe and Rewarding.**\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 8) is currently occupied by my own tail ('T').\n    *   **Rule:** Moving into your own body kills you.\n    *   **Status:** **Death.**\n\n3.  **UP to (1, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 9) is empty (based on Row 9: `. . . . . . . . A .`).\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple at (0, 8).\n    *   **Status:** Safe but inefficient.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (1, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 7) is empty (based on Row 7).\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe, but moves away from the apple at (0, 8).\n    *   **Status:** Safe but inefficient.\n\n**Strategic Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (0, 8) is the optimal move. It secures an apple immediately, increasing my score and length. It avoids the immediate self-collision at (2, 8). The enemy snake is too far away to intercept me at (0, 8) this turn. Eating the apple at (0, 8) positions me on the edge of the board, which limits movement options, but given the head start of the enemy snake (3 apples vs 1), taking the guaranteed point is critical.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0, 8). From (0, 8), I will be at the edge. My next move will likely need to be DOWN to (0, 7) or UP to (0, 9) to avoid getting trapped. I should scan for apples in the left column (x=0) or top row (y=9) to plan my exit.\n\nLEFT",

Coordinate System Correction:**\nThe prompt specifies:\n*   **Normal X,Y coordinates.**\n*   **(0,0) is bottom left.**\n*   **(9,9) is top right.**\n*   **Decreasing Y is DOWN.**\n*   **Increasing Y is UP.**\n\n**2. Visual Board Analysis (Turn 6 State):**\nThe board shows rows 9 to 0. I need to map these visual rows to Y coordinates.\n*   Row 9 (Top) corresponds to Y=9.\n*   Row 8 corresponds to Y=8.\n*   ...\n*   Row 0 (Bottom) corresponds to Y=0.\n\nLet's visualize the relevant rows for my snake (Head: (0,8)):\n\n*   **Row 9 (Y=9):** `. . . . . . . . A .`\n    *   (0,9): Empty\n    *   (1,9): Empty\n    *   (8,9): Apple ('A')\n*   **Row 8 (Y=8):** `0 T T . . . . . . .`\n    *   (0,8): My Head ('0')\n    *   (1,8): My Body ('T')\n    *   (2,8): My Body ('T')\n*   **Row 7 (Y=7):** `. . . . . . . A . .`\n    *   (0,7): Empty\n    *   (1,7): Empty\n*   **Row 6 (Y=6):** `A . . . . . . . A .`\n    *   (0,6): Apple ('A')\n*   **Row 5 (Y=5):** `A A . . . .

Not out of bounds.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe.\n\n*   **DOWN to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Target:** (0,7). Visual check shows Row 7, Col 0 is Empty ('.').\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Outcome:** Safe.\n\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** X = -1.\n    *   **Safety:** Out of bounds (X ranges 0-9).\n    *   **Outcome:** Death. **Eliminated.**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 8):**\n    *   **Target:** (1,8). Visual check shows Row 8, Col 1 is My Body ('T').\n    *   **Safety:** Moving into own body.\n    *   **Outcome:** Death. **Eliminated.**\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n\nI have two safe moves: **UP (0,9)** and **DOWN (0,7)**.\n\n*   **Enemy Status:**\n    *   Head: (4, 3)\n    *   Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)]\n    *   The enemy is located at Y=2-3, far away from my current Y=8. I am safe from direct collision this turn.\n\n*   **Apple Availability:**\n    *   **(0, 9):** Empty.\n    *   **(0, 8):** My Head (previous move result from (1,8)). Note: The prompt says \"Apples at: (4, 0)...\" and lists many apples. However, the visual board shows (0,8) as '0'. I am currently on (0,8). I did not just eat an apple to get here, as my score is still 2. This implies the apple at (0,8) was either eaten previously or the list is just a subset, or I am misinterpreting the visual state. Looking at the \"Apples at\" list: (4, 0), (4, 2), (6, 5), (1, 6), (8, 9), (7, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (7, 7), (6, 1), (2, 4), (1, 5), (8, 6), (0, 5), (0, 2).\n    *   **Current Head (0,8):** Is NOT in the apple list.\n    *   **UP (0,9):** Is NOT in the apple list (Visual shows empty, List confirms no apple there).\n    *   **DOWN (0,7):** Is NOT in the apple list (Visual shows empty).\n    *   **DOWN further to (0,6):** Is an Apple (List: (0,2), (0,5), (0,6) is in Row 6 visual). Wait, (0,6) is in the visual for Row 6.\n    *   **DOWN further to (0,5):** Is an Apple (List: (0,5)). Also visual Row 5 shows 'A' at (0,5).\n\n*   **Path Evaluation:**\n    *   **Option A (Move UP):** Moves to (0,9). (0,9) is a dead end for the right side, but open to the left? No, X=0 is the wall. (0,9) is a top-left corner. From there, I can only go DOWN (back to 0,8) or RIGHT (into my own body if I don't grow). This is a bad trap.\n    *   **Option B (Move DOWN):** Moves to (0,7). This is empty. From (0,7), I can go DOWN to (0,6) to eat an apple.\n        *   Target Apple: (0,6). It is on the path down.\n        *   Next target: (0,5). Also on the path.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (0,9) traps me in the top-left corner. I would have to immediately turn back down or risk getting stuck.\nMoving DOWN to (0,7) keeps me safe and positions me to eat apples at (0,6) and (0,5) in the subsequent turns. The enemy is far away, so I have time to collect these apples on the edge.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (0,7). Prepare to eat the apple at (0,6) next turn. After (0,6), move to (0,5) to eat another apple. Avoid the corner trap at (0,9).\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Based on the game state, I am at (0, 7). The enemy snake is at (4, 2) and is not an immediate threat due to distance and their own body blocking. The apples are clustered at the bottom left.\n\nMy potential moves from (0, 7) are:\n1.  **UP to (0, 8)**: This is my current body segment (specifically the segment I just vacated in the previous turn, or rather, the segment behind my head before I moved to (0, 7)). Moving into my own body results in death. **UNSAFE**.\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 7)**: This is outside the board boundaries. **UNSAFE**.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 7)**: This is empty space. It is a safe move. However, looking at the board and apple distribution, the apples are concentrated in the bottom left quadrants (0-3 x, 0-6 y). Moving Right takes me away from these apples and towards the center/right side where the enemy snake is located or where there are fewer immediate apple opportunities.\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 6)**: This cell contains an apple ('A' at (0, 6) in the visual board, confirmed by the list of apples: (0, 6) is not explicitly listed in the text provided, but (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 5) are. Wait, looking at the text list: Apples at: (4, 0), (6, 5), (1, 6), (8, 9), (7, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (7, 7), (6, 1), (2, 4), (1, 5), (8, 6), (0, 5), (0, 2), (1, 7).\n    Actually, checking the visual board again:\n    Row 6: `A . . . . . . . A .` -> (0, 6) is an apple.\n    Row 5: `A A . . . . A . . .` -> (0, 5) is an apple.\n    Row 4: `. . A . . . . . . .` -> (0, 4) is empty.\n\n    So, (0, 6) is indeed an apple. Moving DOWN to (0, 6) allows me to eat an apple, grow, and stay on the safe left wall. This also sets me up to eat the apple at (0, 5) next turn (provided I don't die, which is unlikely given the enemy's position). This path provides a clear route for the next couple of turns.\n\n    Comparing **RIGHT (1, 7)** and **DOWN (0, 6)**:\n    - **Right (1, 7)**: Safe, but open space. To reach apples, I'd have to navigate around (1, 6) (apple) or (2, 4) (apple), potentially crossing paths with the enemy or my own tail if I grow.\n    - **Down (0, 6)**: Safe, eats an apple (growth), and puts me on a direct path to (0, 5) (apple). This secures 2 points immediately and keeps me on the safe edge.\n\n    **Decision**: DOWN is the superior move. It secures an apple and maintains a safe trajectory along the edge.\n\n**Long-term plan**: Secure the apple at (0, 6). Secure the apple at (0, 5). Then navigate towards the apple at (0, 2) or the cluster at (1, 3), (1, 5), etc., while keeping the enemy snake's position in mind. Avoid the center where the enemy is active.\n\nDOWN",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Analyzing the current state:\n- My head is at (0, 4) after moving DOWN from (0, 5).\n- My body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)].\n- There is an apple at (0, 4) which I have just collected (since I moved into it). I will grow after this turn.\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (6, 1) with a long body stretching towards (2, 3). They are far away and moving slowly (likely up towards the top).\n\nPossible moves:\n1. UP to (0, 5): This is my current body segment. DEAD.\n2. DOWN to (0, 3): Empty. Safe.\n3. LEFT to (-1, 3): Off board. DEAD.\n4. RIGHT to (1, 3): Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nConsiderations:\n- Moving DOWN to (0, 3) keeps me against the left wall. Below (0, 3) is (0, 2), which is an apple. This is a very safe and productive path. I can continue eating apples along the left wall: (0, 2), then potentially (0, 0) or (1, 0). This path is predictable but secure.\n- Moving RIGHT to (1, 3) moves me away from the wall into the interior. This opens up more options but also exposes me to more potential threats. However, looking at the board, (1, 3) is an empty cell. From there, I could move to (1, 2), (2, 3), etc. However, (2, 3) is occupied by the enemy snake's body. (1, 2) is empty.\n\nStrategic choice:\nThe left edge is a \"safe zone\" for a snake. By staying on the left edge, I minimize the number of directions I can be attacked from (only from the right). Moving into the interior increases vulnerability. Since I am currently winning (3 apples vs 6, but I'm growing and have a safe path), I should prioritize survival and steady growth.\n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is very close and safe. Moving DOWN sets me up to eat it next turn. Moving RIGHT doesn't immediately lead to a guaranteed apple without moving into the interior where the enemy might be heading.\n\nWait, looking at the apples list: (0, 2) is an apple. (0, 0) is not listed as an apple (it's empty in the grid). (1, 0) is empty.\nActually, looking at the provided apples list: (4,0), (6,5), (1,6), (8,9), (7,3), (6,0), (1,3), (7,7), (2,4), (1,5), (8,6), (0,2), (1,7), (2,9), (2,7).\nSo (0, 2) IS an apple.\n(1, 3) is also an apple (listed in the apples list). But the board state shows (1, 3) as empty? Let's re-check the board state.\nBoard row 3: `. A T T T . . A . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nRow 3 corresponds to y=3.\nAt index 1 (x=1), it is `A`.\nAt index 2 (x=2), it is `T` (part of enemy body).\nSo (1, 3) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo from (0, 4):\n- DOWN to (0, 3): Empty. Next turn can go DOWN to (0, 2) [Apple] or RIGHT to (1, 3) [Apple]. This is a very strong position.\n- RIGHT to (1, 3): This is an apple. If I go RIGHT, I eat the apple at (1, 3) immediately. However, I would be moving into the \"territory\" near the enemy's body (which is at (2, 3) and (3, 3)). While not immediately dangerous (it's an empty cell with an apple), it puts my head adjacent to the enemy's body.\n\nComparison:\n- Option DOWN (to 0,3): Safe, prepares to eat (0,2). Keeps me against the wall.\n- Option RIGHT (to 1,3): Eats apple immediately, but moves me away from the wall and closer to the enemy.\n\nSince the enemy snake is quite long (7 segments) and currently moving upwards (based on body from (4,1) to (2,3)), they might be heading towards the top-left area eventually. However, for now, they seem focused on the right side of the left zone.\n\nGiven the \"never die\" priority, staying on the wall is statistically safer. However, eating the apple immediately at (1, 3) is tempting. But (0, 3) is also a safe square that leads to (0, 2) (an apple).\n\nLet's look at the connection between (0, 2) and (1, 3). They are adjacent. If I go DOWN to (0, 3), I can go RIGHT to (1, 3) next turn if I want, or DOWN to (0, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3) now, I eat the apple. My tail will not move (growth). My body becomes [(1, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)].\nNext turn from (1, 3), I can go DOWN to (1, 2), LEFT to (0, 3), RIGHT to (2, 3) [Dead - enemy body], or UP to (1, 4).\n(1, 2) is empty.\n(0, 3) will be empty (since I just left it, and my body is currently (0, 4), (0, 5)...).\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (1, 3) now:\nMy body becomes: (1, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6).\nNext turn:\n- UP: (1, 4) - Empty.\n- DOWN: (1, 2) - Empty.\n- LEFT: (0, 3) - Empty (since my body moves to (0, 4), (0, 5) etc, (0, 3) is free).\n- RIGHT: (2, 3) - Dead (Enemy body).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3) now:\nMy body becomes: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6).\nNext turn:\n- DOWN: (0, 2) - Apple.\n- RIGHT: (1, 3) - Apple.\n- LEFT: Dead.\n- UP: (0, 4) - My own body.\n\nBoth moves seem viable. However, staying on the wall (DOWN) is more defensive. The enemy snake is at (6, 1). They are quite far. The distance from (6, 1) to (1, 3) is significant. They would need many turns to reach me.\n\nHowever, consider the long term. The apples on the left side are (0, 2) and (0, 0) (empty). The apples on the bottom row are (4, 0), (6, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I am in the center of the board. If I go DOWN to (0, 3), I am on the edge.\n\nThere is an apple at (1, 3). Eating it immediately is good.\nThere is an apple at (0, 2). Eating it next turn is good.\n\nLet's check the board state again for safety.\nRow 3 (y=3): `. A T T T . . A . .`\nMy potential move RIGHT to (1, 3) lands on the 'A' at x=1.\nThe enemy body is at x=2, 3, 4.\nIf I move to (1, 3), I am adjacent to the enemy body but not overlapping.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT from (6, 1) to (5, 1), or UP to (6, 2), they are still far.\nThe enemy is likely moving up towards the apples at the top (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,9). They are currently at y=1. I am at y=3/4.\nIf I stay on the left, I compete for the apples on the left (0,2). If I move to (1,3), I compete for (1,3) and (1,2) (if it were an apple, it's empty) and (0,2).\n\nActually, looking at the apples: (1, 3) is an apple. (0, 2) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3), I miss the apple at (1, 3). It will remain on the board.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I eat the apple immediately.\n\nHowever, (1, 3) is \"in the open\". (0, 3) is against the wall.\nIs there a reason to rush for (1, 3)? The enemy is far away.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3), I am guaranteed to be able to eat (0, 2) next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I eat (1, 3), but next turn I have to decide where to go. (1, 2) is empty. (0, 3) is empty. (1, 4) is empty.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nHead at (6, 1).\nPossible moves:\n- UP to (6, 2): Empty.\n- DOWN to (6, 0): Empty (but there is an apple at (6, 0)).\n- LEFT to (5, 1): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (7, 1): Empty.\n\nThe enemy has many options.\nThe enemy has 6 apples. I have 3.\nI need to close the gap.\nEating an apple every turn is ideal.\n(0, 3) does not have an apple.\n(1, 3) has an apple.\n(0, 2) has an apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3):\nI do not eat an apple this turn.\nI eat (0, 2) next turn.\nTotal: 1 apple in 2 turns.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 3):\nI eat an apple this turn.\nI can potentially eat (0, 2) or (1, 2) next turn.\nTotal: 1 apple now, 1 next turn (maybe).\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\nRow 4 (y=4): `0 . A . . . . . . .`\nAt x=0, y=4 is my head '0'.\nAt x=2, y=4 is 'A' (apple).\nWait, the apples list includes (2, 4).\nSo there is an apple at (2, 4).\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the board diagram.\nThe board diagram shows:\nRow 4: `0 . A . . . . . . .`\nSo at (2, 4) there is an apple.\nMy current head is (0, 4).\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 4) is empty.\nMoving RIGHT twice gets me to (2, 4) (apple).\nMoving DOWN to (0, 3) moves me away from (2, 4).\n\nLet's look at the apples list again.\nApples: (4, 0), (6, 5), (1, 6), (8, 9), (7, 3), (6, 0), (1, 3), (7, 7), (2, 4), (1, 5), (8, 6), (0, 2), (1, 7), (2, 9), (2, 7).\n(2, 4) is in the list.\n(0, 2) is in the list.\n(1, 3) is in the list.\n\nSo from (0, 4):\n- RIGHT to (1, 4): Empty.\n  - Next turn: RIGHT to (2, 4) [Apple].\n  - Next turn: DOWN to (1, 3) [Apple].\n  - Next turn: UP to (1, 5) [Apple].\n- DOWN to (0, 3): Empty.\n  - Next turn: DOWN to (0, 2) [Apple].\n  - Next turn: RIGHT to (1, 3) [Apple].\n- UP to (0, 5): DEAD (Body).\n- LEFT to (-1, 4): DEAD.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 4):\nI am moving towards multiple apples: (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 5).\nI am moving into the center.\nThe enemy is at (6, 1). They are far.\n(1, 4) is safe.\nFrom (1, 4), I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT, UP.\n(Left goes back to (0, 4), which is currently my body? No, if I move to (1, 4), my body becomes [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]. So (0, 4) is my body. LEFT is death.\nSo from (1, 4), I have 3 safe moves.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3):\nFrom (0, 3), I have 2 safe moves: DOWN to (0, 2) (Apple), RIGHT to (1, 3) (Apple). (Left is death, Up is body).\nSo from (0, 3), I have 2 safe moves.\n\nThe \"keep future options open\" criteria suggests that (1, 4) is better because it has 3 safe moves vs 2 safe moves at (0, 3).\nAlso, moving to (1, 4) gets me closer to (2, 4) which is an apple.\n(2, 4) is a very valuable apple because it is in the center and opens up many paths: (2,5), (3,4), (2,3), (1,4).\n(0, 2) is a dead end. From (0, 2), I can only go RIGHT to (1, 2) or DOWN to (0, 1) or UP to (0, 3).\n(0, 1) is empty.\n(1, 2) is empty.\nSo (0, 2) is not a total dead end, but it is restrictive.\n\nIs (1, 4) safe from the enemy?\nEnemy at (6, 1).\nDistance to (1, 4) is large.\nIf I go to (1, 4), I am safe.\n\nWhat about the apple at (1, 3)? If I go RIGHT to (1, 4), I can eat (1, 3) next turn by going DOWN.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3), I can eat (1, 3) next turn by going RIGHT.\nBoth paths allow eating (1, 3).\n\nHowever, (2, 4) is a unique apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 4), I secure a path to (2, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 3), I have to go RIGHT to (1, 3) then UP to (1, 4) then RIGHT to (2, 4). This takes longer.\nDuring that time, the enemy might grab (2, 4) or other apples.\n\nThe enemy is at y=1. They are moving up.\nThe apple at (2, 4) is at y=4.\nI am at y=4.\nI am closer to (2, 4) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is likely RIGHT to (1, 4).\nThis maximizes safety options (3 directions) and moves towards a valuable apple (2, 4).\n\nLet's double check the board for hidden threats.\nRow 4: `0 . A . . . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. A T T T . . A . .`\nRow 5: `T A . . . . A . . .`\nRow 6: `T A . . . . . . A .`\nRow 7: `T A A . . . . A . .`\n\nMy potential move to (1, 4) is in Row 4, index 1. It's empty.\nThere are no enemy heads adjacent to (1, 4).\nThe enemy body is at (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3). (1, 4) is adjacent to (2, 3)? No, (2, 3) is down-right. (1, 4) is up-right of (0, 4). Wait, coordinates.\n(1, 4) neighbors: (1, 3), (1, 5), (0, 4), (2, 4).\n(2, 3) is not a neighbor of (1, 4).\nSo (1, 4) is safe from the enemy body.\n\nConclusion:\nMove RIGHT to (1, 4).\nThis is safe, increases move options to 3, and targets the apple at (2, 4) which is a strategic hub.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (1, 4) to secure a path to the apple at (2, 4) and maximize future move flexibility. This keeps me safe from the enemy who is currently distant.\n\nRIGHT",

Although (1, 4) is currently occupied by my own body segment (as per the Body list), the game mechanics state that the tail moves first. At Turn 12, my tail is at (0, 6). The sequence of movement (Tail -> Body -> Head) ensures that by the time my head attempts to move to (1, 4), the segment currently at (1, 4) will have moved to (0, 4). Furthermore, moving LEFT positions me safely away from the approaching enemy snake at (7, 0) and keeps me near the large cluster of apples on the left side of the board (specifically (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), and (0, 2)). This move allows me to access the apple at (1, 5) on the subsequent turn while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
