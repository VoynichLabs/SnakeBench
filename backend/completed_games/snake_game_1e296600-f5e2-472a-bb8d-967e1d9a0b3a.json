This move is straightforward and avoids potential collisions.\n\n### Next Move:\n**DOWN**\n\nThis decision prioritizes collecting the nearest apple while avoiding immediate dangers.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN**"

Moving RIGHT will bring the snake closer to this apple.\n\n**Decision**:\n- The next move should be RIGHT to move closer to the apple at (3, 5).\n\nEnd your response with your decided next move: RIGHT."
