Reachable in 2 moves\n- (8, 1): 3 right, 2 down - Moderate distance\n- (9, 2): 4 right, 1 down - Moderate distance\n- (6, 9): 1 right, 6 up - Far, higher up\n- (2, 7): 3 left, 4 up - Far\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 2), which is just one step diagonally away.\n\n**Step 3: Optimal path consideration**\n\nTo reach (4, 2), I could:\n- Go DOWN to (5, 2), then LEFT to (4, 2) - gets the apple in 2 moves\n- Go LEFT to (4, 3), then DOWN to (4, 2) - also 2 moves\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement**\n\nEnemy at (6, 0) is far away. Since both snakes are just heads, there's no immediate collision risk. The enemy could move in any direction, but they're unlikely to interfere with my path to (4, 2).\n\n**Step 5: Choose best move**\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, I prefer **DOWN** because:\n- It keeps me flexible for multiple apple paths\n- Moving toward (4, 2) via DOWN then LEFT seems natural\n- It doesn't trap me in any corner\n- The board has plenty of space\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** Focus on collecting the nearby apple at (4, 2) within the next 2 moves. After that, assess the board state and move toward the next closest apple cluster. Avoid the top-right area initially as it may get crowded. Maintain distance from enemy snake #0.\n\nDOWN",
