A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (5, 7). Let me consider all four directions:\n\n1. UP: (5, 8) - This is a valid move, no obstacles there.\n2. DOWN: (5, 6) - This is a valid move, no obstacles there.\n3. LEFT: (4, 7) - This is a valid move, no obstacles there.\n4. RIGHT: (6, 7) - This is a valid move, no obstacles there.\n\nSince I have no body, I can move in any direction without hitting myself.\n\nNow let me think about apples:\n- (3, 7) is 2 cells to the left of me - closest apple\n- (4, 5) is 1 cell left and 2 cells down\n- (7, 3) is 2 cells right and 4 cells down\n- (8, 0) is 3 cells right and 7 cells down\n- (2, 0) is 3 cells left and 7 cells down\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 7), which is directly to my left. If I go LEFT, I'll be at (4, 7), then one more LEFT to (3, 7) to get the apple.\n\nEnemy snake is at (7, 6). Let me think about where it might go:\n- The apple at (7, 3) is directly below the enemy (3 cells down)\n- The apple at (4, 5) is 3 cells left and 1 cell down from enemy\n\nThe enemy might go for (7, 3) by moving DOWN, or might try to cut me off.\n\nLet me think about potential head-on collisions:\n- If I go DOWN to (5, 6), and enemy goes LEFT to (6, 6), we don't collide.\n- If enemy goes LEFT twice from (7, 6) \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 (5, 6), but that's next turn.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The enemy is at (7, 6). If enemy goes:\n- UP: (7, 7)\n- DOWN: (7, 5)\n- LEFT: (6, 6)\n- RIGHT: (8, 6)\n\nFrom my position (5, 7):\n- UP: (5, 8)\n- DOWN: (5, 6)\n- LEFT: (4, 7)\n- RIGHT: (6, 7)\n\nNo immediate head-on collision possibility since we're not adjacent in a way that could cause this.\n\nStrategy: The closest apple to me is at (3, 7), which is 2 cells to my left. Going LEFT would get me closer to that apple.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (4, 5) is also relatively close (1 left, 2 down from current position).\n\nI think going LEFT towards (3, 7) is a good strategy. This puts me at (4, 7), and then I can get the apple at (3, 7) next turn.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- LEFT to (4, 7) is safe\n- From (4, 7), I can then go LEFT again to (3, 7) to get the apple\n\nThis seems like a good plan. The enemy is unlikely to contest this apple since they're closer to (7, 3) and (4, 5) from their current position.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The enemy at (7, 6) could potentially go for (4, 5) as well. From (7, 6):\n- To (4, 5): needs to go 3 left and 1 down = 4 moves\nFrom me at (5, 7):\n- To (4, 5): needs to go 1 left and 2 down = 3 moves\n\nI'm closer to (4, 5) as well.\n\nFor (3, 7):\n- From me: 2 left = 2 moves\n- From enemy at (7, 6): 4 left and 1 up = 5 moves\n\nI'm much closer to (3, 7).\n\nLet me go LEFT to start collecting (3, 7).\n\nActually, I should also consider future positioning. Going left keeps me in a good central position with room to maneuver.\n\nDecision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (5, 7) with no body. Enemy snake head is at (7, 6) with no body.\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n- UP to (5, 8): Safe, open space\n- DOWN to (5, 6): Safe, open space\n- LEFT to (4, 7): Safe, moves toward apple at (3, 7)\n- RIGHT to (6, 7): Safe, but moves toward enemy\n\nAll four moves are safe (no walls, no bodies to hit).\n\nConsidering apple proximity:\n- Apple at (3, 7) is just 2 cells to my left - closest apple!\n- Apple at (4, 5) is 3 moves away\n- Other apples are farther\n\nThe enemy at (7, 6) is likely to go for the apple at (7, 3) which is directly below them, or possibly (4, 5). They're unlikely to contest (3, 7) since I'm much closer.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:** Go LEFT twice to grab the apple at (3, 7), then reassess. After that, (4, 5) would be a good next target since it's nearby.\n\nMoving LEFT puts me at (4, 7), one step away from the apple at (3, 7). This is efficient apple collection while maintaining good board position.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT: (5, 7) - Valid move, no obstacles\n\nSince I have no body, I can move in any direction without hitting myself.\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake at (7, 7):\n- They could move UP to (7, 8)\n- They could move DOWN to (7, 6)\n- They could move LEFT to (6, 7)\n- They could move RIGHT to (8, 7)\n\nNone of these moves would collide with my potential moves:\n- If I go LEFT to (3, 7), enemy can't reach there in one move from (7, 7)\n- No head-on collision risk\n\nThe apple at (3, 7) is right next to me (1 cell left). This is the perfect opportunity to grab it!\n\nAfter getting the apple at (3, 7), my body will be at (4, 7) and head at (3, 7).\n\nLet me verify LEFT is safe:\n- (3, 7) is within bounds (0-9 for both x and y) \u2713\n- No snake body at (3, 7) \u2713\n- Enemy head is at (7, 7), can't reach (3, 7) in one move \u2713\n- There's an apple at (3, 7)! \u2713\n\nThis is clearly the best move - I get an apple with no risk!\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:** After getting the apple at (3, 7), I should look at the apple at (4, 5) next. From (3, 7), I would need to go:\n- RIGHT to (4, 7) - but that would be my body after eating\n- Actually, after eating at (3, 7), my body would extend to where I came from\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. After eating the apple:\n- My head will be at (3, 7)\n- My tail/body will be at (4, 7) (where my head was)\n\nSo from (3, 7), my options would be:\n- UP to (3, 8) - safe\n- DOWN to (3, 6) - safe\n- LEFT to (2, 7) - safe\n- RIGHT to (4, 7) - that would be my own body! Not safe!\n\nSo after eating, I can't go right. I could go:\n- DOWN towards (4, 5) - would need to go down then right\n- LEFT then DOWN to eventually reach (4, 5)\n\nThe enemy at (7, 7) might go for (7, 3) which is directly below them, or they might come towards the center for (4, 5).\n\nFor now, the clear move is LEFT to grab the apple at (3, 7).\n\nDecision: LEFT\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current board state:\n\nMy head is at (4, 7) with no body. Enemy snake head is at (7, 7) with no body.\n\nThere's an apple directly to my left at (3, 7)! This is a perfect opportunity.\n\nLet me verify all moves:\n- UP to (4, 8): Safe, but no immediate reward\n- DOWN to (4, 6): Safe, but no immediate reward  \n- LEFT to (3, 7): Safe AND there's an apple there!\n- RIGHT to (5, 7): Safe, moving toward enemy\n\nChecking for potential collisions with enemy:\n- Enemy at (7, 7) could move to (6, 7), (7, 8), (7, 6), or (8, 7)\n- None of these would reach (3, 7), so no head-on collision risk\n\nThe decision is clear - I should grab the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**Strategy for future turns:** After eating the apple at (3, 7), my body will be at (4, 7). From (3, 7), I cannot go RIGHT (would hit my own body). I should plan to go DOWN or LEFT, then work my way toward the apple at (4, 5). The enemy is likely to go for the apple at (7, 3) which is closer to them. Keep an eye on (4, 5) as a potential contested apple.\n\nLEFT",

If I move DOWN to (3, 6):\n- My head will be at (3, 6)\n- My tail will move from (4, 7) to (3, 7) (where my head was)\n\nSo after moving DOWN:\n- Head at (3, 6)\n- Body at (3, 7)\n\nThen from (3, 6), I could go:\n- UP to (3, 7) - that's my body!\n- DOWN to (3, 5)\n- LEFT to (2, 6)\n- RIGHT to (4, 6)\n\nSo I could go RIGHT after going DOWN, and work my way to (4, 5).\n\nPath to (4, 5) from (3, 7):\n1. DOWN to (3, 6) - body at (3, 7)\n2. RIGHT to (4, 6) - body at (3, 6)\n3. DOWN to (4, 5) - APPLE! - body at (4, 6)\n\nThis seems like a good plan.\n\nLet me also consider the enemy. They're at (6, 7) and might target:\n- (4, 5): Distance from (6, 7) is |4-6| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves\n- (7, 3): Distance from (6, 7) is |7-6| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves\n\nSo the enemy is 4 moves from (4, 5), while I'm 3 moves away. I can get there first if I go efficiently!\n\nLet me verify:\n- Turn 2 (now): I move DOWN to (3, 6), enemy might move LEFT to (5, 7) or DOWN to (6, 6)\n- Turn 3: I move RIGHT to (4, 6), enemy continues toward (4, 5)\n- Turn 4: I move DOWN to (4, 5) and get the apple!\n\nIf enemy goes directly toward (4, 5):\n- Turn 2: Enemy at (6, 7), moves LEFT to (5, 7)\n- Turn 3: Enemy at (5, 7), moves DOWN to (5, 6)\n- Turn 4: Enemy at (5, 6), moves LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5)\n\nActually, let me recalculate. From (6, 7) to (4, 5):\n- Could go LEFT to (5, 7), then LEFT to (4, 7), then DOWN to (4, 6), then DOWN to (4, 5) = 4 moves\n- Or DOWN to (6, 6), DOWN to (6, 5), LEFT to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 5) = 4 moves\n\nSo enemy takes 4 moves, I take 3. I should win the race to (4, 5)!\n\nBut wait, the enemy might anticipate this and try to cut me off. Let me think about potential head-on collisions:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 6), and enemy moves... they can't reach (3, 6) from (6, 7) in one move. Safe.\n\nIf both of us race to (4, 5):\n- Turn 2: Me at (3, 6), Enemy possibly at (5, 7)\n- Turn 3: Me at (4, 6), Enemy possibly at (4, 7) or (5, 6)\n- Turn 4: Me at (4, 5), Enemy possibly at (4, 6) or (4, 5)\n\nWait, if enemy goes (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (4,5), that's also 4 moves to the apple. But on turn 4, if enemy is at (4, 6) heading to (4, 5), and I'm at (4, 6) heading to (4, 5)... wait, let me trace this more carefully.\n\nTurn 2 (current turn):\n- Me: (3, 7) -> DOWN -> (3, 6)\n- Enemy: (6, 7) -> ? (let's say LEFT -> (5, 7))\n\nTurn 3:\n- Me: (3, 6) -> RIGHT -> (4, 6)\n- Enemy: (5, 7) -> ? (let's say LEFT -> (4, 7))\n\nTurn 4:\n- Me: (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5) [APPLE!]\n- Enemy: (4, 7) -> DOWN -> (4, 6)\n\nNo collision! I get the apple first.\n\nBut what if enemy goes a different route?\n\nTurn 2:\n- Me: (3, 7) -> DOWN -> (3, 6)\n- Enemy: (6, 7) -> DOWN -> (6, 6)\n\nTurn 3:\n- Me: (3, 6) -> RIGHT -> (4, 6)\n- Enemy: (6, 6) -> DOWN -> (6, 5)\n\nTurn 4:\n- Me: (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5) [APPLE!]\n- Enemy: (6, 5) -> LEFT -> (5, 5)\n\nStill no collision, I still get the apple.\n\nOK, let me also consider going UP first. From (3, 7) going UP to (3, 8):\n- Then I'd need to work my way down to (4, 5)\n- UP is moving away from the apple, not ideal\n\nGoing LEFT to (2, 7):\n- Moving away from (4, 5)\n- Not ideal for that apple\n- Could be useful for apples at (2, 0) or (1, 0) later, but those are far\n\nI think DOWN is the best move - it gets me closer to (4, 5) and keeps me safe.\n\nDecision: DOWN\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** \n- Turn 3: Go RIGHT to (4, 6)\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN to (4, 5) to get the apple\n- After that, consider going for apples at (7, 3) or the ones at the bottom of the board\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (3, 7), body at (4, 7). Enemy head is at (6, 7) with no body.\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (3, 8): Safe, but moves away from nearest apples\n- DOWN to (3, 6): Safe, moves toward apple at (4, 5)\n- LEFT to (2, 7): Safe, but moves away from nearest apple\n- RIGHT to (4, 7): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n\nRIGHT is eliminated - can't go backwards.\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 5), which is 3 moves away from me. The enemy at (6, 7) is 4 moves away from the same apple. I can beat them to it!\n\nMy optimal path to (4, 5):\n1. DOWN to (3, 6) - this turn\n2. RIGHT to (4, 6) - next turn\n3. DOWN to (4, 5) - get the apple!\n\nChecking for head-on collision risks this turn:\n- Enemy at (6, 7) could move to (5, 7), (6, 6), (6, 8), or (7, 7)\n- None of these conflict with my move to (3, 6)\n\nAfter I move DOWN, my body shifts: head at (3, 6), body at (3, 7). From there, I can go RIGHT next turn safely.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 3: Go RIGHT to (4, 6)\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple\n- Then target either (7, 3) or the bottom row apples (2, 0), (1, 0)\n\nDOWN",

DOWN: (3, 5) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n3. LEFT: (2, 6) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n4. RIGHT: (4, 6) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n\nSo UP is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake at (6, 6):\n- They could move UP to (6, 7)\n- They could move DOWN to (6, 5)\n- They could move LEFT to (5, 6)\n- They could move RIGHT to (7, 6)\n\nNone of these would collide with my potential moves (3, 5), (2, 6), or (4, 6).\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn:\n- Turn 3 (now): Go RIGHT to (4, 6)\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN to (4, 5) to get the apple\n\nThe apple at (4, 5) is my target. Let me verify:\n- From (3, 6), going RIGHT to (4, 6) puts me 1 move away from the apple at (4, 5)\n- From (3, 6), going DOWN to (3, 5) puts me 1 move right of the apple at (4, 5)\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n- Apple at (4, 5)\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 6), then DOWN to (4, 5) = 2 moves total, get apple on turn 4\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 5), then RIGHT to (4, 5) = 2 moves total, get apple on turn 4\n\nBoth paths work! Let me check which is safer.\n\nEnemy at (6, 6):\n- Distance to (4, 5): |4-6| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 moves\n- Distance to (4, 6): |4-6| + |6-6| = 2 + 0 = 2 moves\n\nHmm, if enemy goes LEFT twice, they reach (4, 6) at the same time I would if I go RIGHT now!\n\nTurn 3:\n- Me: (3, 6) -> RIGHT -> (4, 6)\n- Enemy: (6, 6) -> LEFT -> (5, 6)\n\nTurn 4:\n- Me: (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5) [APPLE!]\n- Enemy: (5, 6) -> LEFT -> (4, 6) or DOWN -> (5, 5)\n\nNo collision at (4, 6) on turn 4 because I'd be moving DOWN from there.\n\nWait, let me re-check turn 3:\n- If I move RIGHT to (4, 6) and enemy moves LEFT to (5, 6), no collision - we're at different cells.\n\nWhat if enemy tries to go for (4, 5) more directly?\nTurn 3:\n- Me: (3, 6) -> RIGHT -> (4, 6)\n- Enemy: (6, 6) -> DOWN -> (6, 5)\n\nTurn 4:\n- Me: (4, 6) -> DOWN -> (4, 5) [APPLE!]\n- Enemy: (6, 5) -> LEFT -> (5, 5)\n\nTurn 5:\n- Me at (4, 5), Enemy at (5, 5)\n\nStill safe!\n\nWhat about the other path? If I go DOWN first:\nTurn 3:\n- Me: (3, 6) -> DOWN -> (3, 5)\n- Enemy: (6, 6) -> ? \n\nTurn 4:\n- Me: (3, 5) -> RIGHT -> (4, 5) [APPLE!]\n- Enemy at various positions\n\nActually wait, there's an apple at (4, 5). If I'm at (3, 5) and go RIGHT to (4, 5), I get the apple. Same number of moves.\n\nLet me check for potential head-on collision:\n- If enemy rushes to (4, 5)...\n- From (6, 6), enemy can take: LEFT to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 6), DOWN to (4, 5) = 3 moves\n- Or: DOWN to (6, 5), LEFT to (5, 5), LEFT to (4, 5) = 3 moves\n\nSo enemy takes 3 moves to reach (4, 5). I take 2 moves.\n\nIf I go RIGHT first (my plan):\n- Turn 3: Me at (4, 6), Enemy possibly at (5, 6)\n- Turn 4: Me at (4, 5) [APPLE!], Enemy possibly at (4, 6)\n\nIf I go DOWN first:\n- Turn 3: Me at (3, 5), Enemy possibly at (5, 6)\n- Turn 4: Me at (4, 5) [APPLE!], Enemy possibly at (4, 6)\n\nBoth paths avoid collision with the enemy and get me the apple in 2 moves.\n\nLet me think about which gives me better positioning after getting the apple:\n- If I go RIGHT then DOWN, after eating apple I'm at (4, 5) with body at (4, 6), (3, 6)\n  - I can then go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (not UP because that's my body)\n- If I go DOWN then RIGHT, after eating apple I'm at (4, 5) with body at (3, 5), (3, 6)\n  - I can then go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (not LEFT because that's my body)\n\nHmm, both seem fine. Let me stick with my original plan: RIGHT.\n\nActually, let me also consider: what if the enemy also goes for (4, 5) and takes the same path as me?\n\nPossible head-on collision scenario:\n- Turn 3: Me goes RIGHT to (4, 6), Enemy goes... they can't reach (4, 6) from (6, 6) in one move. Closest they get is (5, 6). Safe.\n- Turn 4: Me goes DOWN to (4, 5), Enemy could be at (4, 6) going DOWN to (4, 5)... \n\nWait! If enemy goes LEFT twice: (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6), then on turn 4 if I'm at (4,6) going DOWN and enemy is at (4,6)... no wait, on turn 3, enemy would be at (5,6), not (4,6). Let me trace more carefully:\n\nTurn 3 (this turn):\n- Me at (3, 6), move RIGHT, end at (4, 6)\n- Enemy at (6, 6), move LEFT, end at (5, 6)\n- No collision\n\nTurn 4:\n- Me at (4, 6), move DOWN, end at (4, 5)\n- Enemy at (5, 6), move LEFT, end at (4, 6)\n- No collision (we're moving into different cells)\n\nTurn 5:\n- Me at (4, 5) (just ate apple, body at (4, 6), (3, 6))\n- Wait, I need to recalculate my body after eating the apple...\n\nAfter eating apple on turn 4:\n- My body grows! So instead of body at (4, 6), (3, 6), I would have body at (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7) maybe? No wait, my current body is just (3, 7), so after eating:\n- Turn 3: Head at (4, 6), body at (3, 6) [tail was at (3, 7), moves to where head was]\n- Turn 4: Head at (4, 5), eat apple, body grows to (4, 6), (3, 6) [body includes previous head position, and we don't shrink the tail]\n\nWait, let me think about how snake growing works. When I eat an apple:\n- My head moves to the apple\n- My body follows normally\n- But instead of the tail moving, it stays in place (or we add a segment)\n\nSo currently:\n- Head: (3, 6)\n- Body: [(3, 7)]\n\nAfter turn 3 (move RIGHT, no apple):\n- Head: (4, 6)\n- Body: [(3, 6)] - old head position, tail at (3, 7) disappears\n\nAfter turn 4 (move DOWN, eat apple at (4, 5)):\n- Head: (4, 5)\n- Body: [(4, 6), (3, 6)] - the tail stays because we ate an apple\n\nOK so my body would be at (4, 6), (3, 6). Then on turn 5:\n- I could move UP (blocked by body at (4, 6))\n- DOWN to (4, 4) - safe\n- LEFT to (3, 5) - safe\n- RIGHT to (5, 5) - safe\n\nGood, I have options after eating the apple.\n\nLet me confirm RIGHT is the best choice this turn:\n\nRIGHT to (4, 6):\n- Gets me closer to apple at (4, 5)\n- No immediate danger\n- Good follow-up options\n\nDOWN to (3, 5):\n- Also gets me closer to apple at (4, 5)\n- No immediate danger\n- Good follow-up options\n\nLEFT to (2, 6):\n- Moves away from apple at (4, 5)\n- Could be useful for apples at bottom left later\n- Not optimal right now\n\nThe apple at (4, 5) is my priority. Both RIGHT and DOWN work, but RIGHT follows my planned path.\n\nLet me also check if enemy might make an unexpected move:\n- If enemy goes UP to (6, 7), DOWN to (6, 5), LEFT to (5, 6), or RIGHT to (7, 6)\n- None of these collide with (4, 6)\n\nI'll stick with RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple\n- Turn 5+: Head toward (7, 3) or the bottom row apples, depending on where the enemy goes\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (3, 6), body at (3, 7). Enemy head is at (6, 6) with no body.\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (3, 7): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- DOWN to (3, 5): Safe, moves toward apple at (4, 5)\n- LEFT to (2, 6): Safe, but moves away from nearest apple\n- RIGHT to (4, 6): Safe, moves toward apple at (4, 5)\n\nUP is eliminated - can't go backwards into my body.\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn, I should go RIGHT to (4, 6), then DOWN to (4, 5) to get the apple.\n\nChecking for head-on collision risks this turn:\n- Enemy at (6, 6) could move to (6, 7), (6, 5), (5, 6), or (7, 6)\n- None of these conflict with my move to (4, 6)\n\nDistance to apple at (4, 5):\n- Me from (3, 6): 2 moves (RIGHT then DOWN)\n- Enemy from (6, 6): 3 moves minimum\n\nI can beat the enemy to this apple!\n\nAfter going RIGHT to (4, 6), my body will be at (3, 6). Next turn I can safely go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 4: Go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple\n- Turn 5+: Target either (7, 3) or the bottom row apples (2, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0)\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN: (4, 5) - Valid move, APPLE HERE! This is great!\n3. LEFT: (3, 6) - This is where my body is! I would die!\n4. RIGHT: (5, 6) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake at (6, 7):\n- They could move UP to (6, 8)\n- They could move DOWN to (6, 6)\n- They could move LEFT to (5, 7)\n- They could move RIGHT to (7, 7)\n\nNone of these would collide with my potential moves (4, 7), (4, 5), or (5, 6).\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn:\n- Turn 4 (now): Go DOWN to (4, 5) to get the apple!\n\nThis is exactly what I planned! Let me verify:\n- From (4, 6), going DOWN to (4, 5) gets me the apple!\n- No collision risk with the enemy who is at (6, 7)\n\nLet me check if there's any risk of head-on collision:\n- Enemy at (6, 7) cannot reach (4, 5) in one move\n- Enemy would need: LEFT to (5, 7), then LEFT to (4, 7), then DOWN to (4, 6), then DOWN to (4, 5) = 4 moves\n- Or: DOWN to (6, 6), LEFT to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 6), DOWN to (4, 5) = 4 moves\n\nI can definitely get this apple safely.\n\nWhat about going UP or RIGHT instead?\n- UP to (4, 7): Safe, but delays getting the apple at (4, 5)\n- RIGHT to (5, 6): Safe, but moves away from the apple\n\nDOWN is clearly the best choice - I get an apple!\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4, 5):\n- My head will be at (4, 5)\n- My body will grow to [(4, 6), (3, 6)]\n- Apples collected: 2\n\nFrom (4, 5), on turn 5 I can:\n- UP to (4, 6): BLOCKED by my own body\n- DOWN to (4, 4): Safe\n- LEFT to (3, 5): Safe\n- RIGHT to (5, 5): Safe\n\nGood, I have 3 safe options after eating the apple.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 4 (now): Go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple\n- Turn 5+: Head toward (7, 3) next - it's at distance |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n- Or head toward bottom row apples: (2, 0), (1, 0), (8, 0)\n\nFrom (4, 5), the closest apples are:\n- (7, 3): 5 moves\n- (2, 0): |2-4| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7 moves\n- (1, 0): |1-4| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8 moves\n- (8, 0): |8-4| + |0-5| = 4 + 5 = 9 moves\n\n(7, 3) is the closest. After eating apple at (4, 5), I should head toward (7, 3).\n\nPath to (7, 3) from (4, 5):\n- Option 1: RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT DOWN DOWN = (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3)\n- Option 2: DOWN DOWN RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT = (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3)\n\nBoth work. Let me see which is safer.\n\nTurn 5: From (4, 5), go DOWN to (4, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 5)\n\nEnemy at (6, 7) is currently headed... I'm not sure where. They might go for (7, 3) too, or the bottom apples, or come after me.\n\nFrom (6, 7), distance to (7, 3) = |7-6| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves\nI'm at (4, 5) after this turn, distance to (7, 3) = 5 moves\n\nIt's a tie! If we both go for (7, 3), we might collide.\n\nActually, let me be more careful. After I eat the apple at (4, 5):\n- I'm at (4, 5)\n- Enemy is somewhere near (6, 7) (depending on their move)\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN from (6, 7) to (6, 6), then:\n- Enemy at (6, 6), me at (4, 5)\n- Distance for enemy to (7, 3) = |7-6| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4 moves\n- Distance for me to (7, 3) = |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\nEnemy would get there first!\n\nMaybe I should go for the bottom row apples instead? Let me calculate:\n- (2, 0) from (4, 5): 7 moves\n- (1, 0) from (4, 5): 8 moves\n\nFrom (6, 6):\n- (2, 0): |2-6| + |0-6| = 4 + 6 = 10 moves\n- (1, 0): |1-6| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11 moves\n\nI'm much closer to the bottom-left apples! That's a better strategy.\n\n**Updated strategy:**\n- Turn 4 (now): Go DOWN to (4, 5) to collect the apple\n- Turn 5+: Head toward (2, 0) and (1, 0) - I can collect both!\n- Path: (4, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0)\n- Or more directly: go LEFT and DOWN alternating\n\nActually, let me just focus on turn 4 for now. DOWN to get the apple is the clear choice.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n\nMy head is at (4, 6), body at (3, 6). Enemy head moved to (6, 7).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (4, 7): Safe, but no apple\n- DOWN to (4, 5): Safe, and there's an APPLE there! \n- LEFT to (3, 6): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- RIGHT to (5, 6): Safe, but moves away from apple\n\nLEFT is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nThis is exactly the move I planned last turn! Going DOWN to (4, 5) gets me the apple immediately.\n\nChecking for head-on collision risks:\n- Enemy at (6, 7) could move to (6, 8), (6, 6), (5, 7), or (7, 7)\n- None of these conflict with my move to (4, 5)\n- Enemy is 4+ moves away from (4, 5), so no risk\n\nAfter eating this apple, my body will be at [(4, 6), (3, 6)] and I'll have 2 apples total.\n\nFrom (4, 5), I'll have options: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (not UP due to body).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 5+: Head toward the bottom-left apples (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- Enemy is far from those apples (10+ moves), while I'm only 7-8 moves away\n- This gives me a safe path to collect multiple apples without competition\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: (5, 5) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n\nSo UP is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake at (7, 7):\n- They could move UP to (7, 8)\n- They could move DOWN to (7, 6)\n- They could move LEFT to (6, 7)\n- They could move RIGHT to (8, 7)\n\nNone of these would collide with my potential moves (4, 4), (3, 5), or (5, 5).

Let me check - body will be at (4, 5), (4, 6)), DOWN to (4, 3), LEFT to (3, 4), RIGHT to (5, 4)\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves next turn\n\nGoing LEFT to (3, 5):\n- Gets me closer to (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- From (3, 5), I can go: UP to (3, 6) - wait, that's where my tail is. Will my tail move?\n  - Currently body is [(4, 6), (3, 6)]\n  - After I move to (3, 5), my body becomes [(4, 5), (4, 6)] and tail at (3, 6) moves away\n  - So UP to (3, 6) would be safe!\n- From (3, 5): UP to (3, 6) safe, DOWN to (3, 4) safe, LEFT to (2, 5) safe, RIGHT to (4, 5) blocked by body\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves next turn\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5, 5):\n- Moves me slightly toward (7, 3) but away from (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- The enemy at (7, 7) might be going for (7, 3)\n- I should focus on the bottom-left apples since I'm closer\n\nLet me calculate distances:\n\nFrom (4, 4):\n- To (2, 0): |2-4| + |0-4| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-4| + |0-4| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves\n\nFrom (3, 5):\n- To (2, 0): |2-3| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-3| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7 moves\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give similar distances to the apples.\n\nLet me think about the enemy:\n- Enemy at (7, 7) could go for (7, 3) - distance |7-7| + |3-7| = 4 moves\n- Enemy at (7, 7) could go for (9, 9) - distance |9-7| + |9-7| = 4 moves\n- Enemy at (7, 7) could go for (8, 0) - distance |8-7| + |0-7| = 1 + 7 = 8 moves\n\nThe enemy is likely to go for either (7, 3) or (9, 9) since they're closest.\n\nI should head to the bottom-left corner to get (2, 0) and (1, 0). Let me plan a path:\n\nFrom (4, 5):\n- Option 1: DOWN to (4, 4), then continue DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 0)\n- Option 2: LEFT to (3, 5), then continue DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 0)\n\nBoth are reasonable. Let me go with DOWN since it's more direct toward the bottom row.\n\nPath plan:\n- Turn 5 (now): DOWN to (4, 4)\n- Turn 6: DOWN to (4, 3)\n- Turn 7: DOWN to (4, 2)\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (4, 1)\n- Turn 9: DOWN to (4, 0)\n- Turn 10: LEFT to (3, 0)\n- Turn 11: LEFT to (2, 0) - APPLE!\n- Turn 12: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE!\n\nOr I could go more diagonally:\n- Turn 5 (now): DOWN to (4, 4)\n- Turn 6: LEFT to (3, 4)\n- Turn 7: DOWN to (3, 3)\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (3, 2)\n- Turn 9: DOWN to (3, 1)\n- Turn 10: DOWN to (3, 0)\n- Turn 11: LEFT to (2, 0) - APPLE!\n- Turn 12: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE!\n\nBoth paths take about the same time.\n\nWait, let me also consider if I should go for (7, 3) first since it's closer:\nFrom (4, 5) to (7, 3): |7-4| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\nBut the enemy at (7, 7) is only 4 moves away from (7, 3).\n\nIf I go for (7, 3):\n- I need 5 moves\n- Enemy needs 4 moves\n- Enemy would get there first!\n\nSo I should definitely focus on (2, 0) and (1, 0) where I have the advantage.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (4, 4)\n\nThis keeps me on track toward the bottom-left apples and gives me good flexibility.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 5 (now): DOWN to (4, 4)\n- Continue heading toward (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- Collect both apples (they're adjacent!)\n- After that, consider (8, 0) or (7, 3) depending on enemy position\n- Keep avoiding the enemy - they're likely going for (7, 3) or (9, 9)\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (4, 5), body at [(4, 6), (3, 6)]. Enemy at (7, 7).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (4, 6): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- DOWN to (4, 4): Safe, clear path\n- LEFT to (3, 5): Safe, clear path\n- RIGHT to (5, 5): Safe, clear path\n\nUP is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy at (7, 7) is likely heading toward (7, 3) (4 moves away) or (9, 9) (4 moves away)\n- I'm 5 moves from (7, 3), so enemy would beat me there\n- However, I'm much closer to the bottom-left apples:\n  - (2, 0): 7 moves for me vs 10+ for enemy\n  - (1, 0): 8 moves for me vs 11+ for enemy\n\nFollowing my strategy from last turn to go for (2, 0) and (1, 0), I should head down and left.\n\nDOWN to (4, 4) is the best choice:\n- Moves me directly toward the bottom row\n- Keeps me on the safe side of the board, away from enemy\n- From (4, 4), I'll have 3 safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 6+: Continue heading toward (2, 0) via down/left movements\n- Path: (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 (3, 0) \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 (1, 0)\n- This lets me collect 2 apples while enemy goes for (7, 3) or (9, 9)\n- After bottom apples, I can reassess and go for (8, 0) or other remaining apples\n\nDOWN",

Let me check\n  - Currently body is [(4, 5), (4, 6)]\n  - After I move to (4, 3), my body becomes [(4, 4), (4, 5)] and tail at (4, 6) moves away\n  - So UP to (4, 4) would be blocked by body!\n- From (4, 3): DOWN to (4, 2) safe, LEFT to (3, 3) safe, RIGHT to (5, 3) safe\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves next turn\n\nGoing LEFT to (3, 4):\n- Gets me closer to (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- From (3, 4), my body becomes [(4, 4), (4, 5)]\n- From (3, 4): UP to (3, 5) safe, DOWN to (3, 3) safe, LEFT to (2, 4) safe, RIGHT to (4, 4) blocked by body\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves next turn\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5, 4):\n- Moves me away from (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- Moves me closer to enemy territory\n- Not ideal\n\nLet me calculate distances to nearest apples:\n\nFrom (4, 3) [after DOWN]:\n- To (2, 0): |2-4| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-4| + |0-3| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves\n- To (7, 3): |7-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3 moves\n\nFrom (3, 4) [after LEFT]:\n- To (2, 0): |2-3| + |0-4| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-3| + |0-4| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\n- To (7, 3): |7-3| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves\n\nInteresting - from (4, 3), I'm only 3 moves from (7, 3)! Let me think about the enemy:\n- Enemy at (6, 7) to (7, 3): |7-6| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves\n- If I go DOWN to (4, 3), I'd be 3 moves from (7, 3)\n- So I could beat the enemy to (7, 3)!\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN, the apple at (7, 3) is:\n- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT from (4, 3) to (7, 3)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Going for (7, 3) would mean:\n- Turn 6 (now): DOWN to (4, 3)\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (5, 3)\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (6, 3)\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - APPLE!\n\nThat's 3 moves. Enemy is 5 moves away. I can get this apple!\n\nBut wait, I should also consider if the enemy goes for (9, 9):\n- Enemy at (6, 7) to (9, 9): |9-6| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\nSo the enemy could go for either (7, 3) or (9, 9), both 5 moves away.\n\nIf I go for (7, 3), I can get there in 3 moves. After that, I can continue to other apples.\n\nBut let me reconsider my original plan - going for (2, 0) and (1, 0):\n- These are safe because the enemy is far away\n- I can collect 2 apples in quick succession\n\nLet me think about what's optimal:\n\nOption A: Go for (7, 3) first\n- Turn 6: DOWN to (4, 3)\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (5, 3)\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (6, 3)\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - APPLE! (Score: 3)\n- Then head to bottom-left\n\nOption B: Go for (2, 0) and (1, 0) first\n- Turn 6: DOWN to (4, 3)\n- Turn 7: DOWN to (4, 2)\n- Turn 8: DOWN to (4, 1)\n- Turn 9: DOWN to (4, 0)\n- Turn 10: LEFT to (3, 0)\n- Turn 11: LEFT to (2, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 3)\n- Turn 12: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 4)\n\nOption A gets me 1 apple by turn 9.\nOption B gets me 1 apple by turn 11, but 2 apples by turn 12.\n\nActually, let me recalculate Option A after getting (7, 3):\n- Turn 9: at (7, 3) - apple collected\n- Then head to (8, 0):\n  - Turn 10: DOWN to (7, 2)\n  - Turn 11: DOWN to (7, 1)\n  - Turn 12: DOWN to (7, 0)\n  - Turn 13: RIGHT to (8, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 4)\n- Then head to (2, 0) and (1, 0)...\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Let me simplify:\n\nGoing DOWN to (4, 3) keeps both options open. I can decide next turn whether to go RIGHT toward (7, 3) or continue DOWN toward (2, 0)/(1, 0).\n\nActually, let me think about LEFT to (3, 4) vs DOWN to (4, 3):\n- LEFT to (3, 4): commits me more toward the left side\n- DOWN to (4, 3): gives me flexibility to go either toward (7, 3) or toward (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n\nDOWN seems more flexible.\n\nLet me also check for any dangers:\n- If enemy moves toward me from (6, 7), they could go to (5, 7), (6, 6), (6, 8), or (7, 7)\n- None of these are near (4, 3) or (3, 4)\n- I'm safe from enemy collision this turn\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (4, 3)\n\nThis gives me flexibility to:\n1. Go RIGHT toward (7, 3) - I can reach it in 3 moves (faster than enemy's 5 moves)\n2. Continue DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- I'll decide next turn based on enemy movement\n- If enemy heads toward (7, 3), I might pivot to (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n- If enemy heads toward (9, 9), I can safely grab (7, 3) first\n- Current score: me 2, enemy 0 - I'm ahead!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (4, 4), body at [(4, 5), (4, 6)]. Enemy at (6, 7).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (4, 5): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- DOWN to (4, 3): Safe, clear path\n- LEFT to (3, 4): Safe, clear path\n- RIGHT to (5, 4): Safe, clear path\n\nUP is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy at (6, 7) could go toward (7, 3) or (9, 9), both ~5 moves away\n- None of their possible moves threaten my safe options this turn\n\nStrategic analysis:\n- From (4, 3) after going DOWN, I'm only 3 moves from (7, 3)! (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT)\n- Enemy needs 5 moves to reach (7, 3) - I can beat them there!\n- DOWN also keeps the path to (2, 0) and (1, 0) open\n\nDOWN to (4, 3) offers the most flexibility:\n1. I can go RIGHT toward (7, 3) and beat the enemy to it\n2. Or I can continue DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 7: Decide based on enemy direction\n  - If enemy heads toward (7, 3): pivot to (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n  - If enemy heads toward (9, 9): go RIGHT to grab (7, 3) quickly\n- Current advantage: I'm at 2 apples, enemy at 0\n- Path to (7, 3): (4, 3) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 (7, 3)\n- Alternate path: (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 ... \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 (1, 0)\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: (5, 3) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n\nSo UP is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me think about the enemy snake at (5, 7):\n- They could move UP to (5, 8)\n- They could move DOWN to (5, 6)\n- They could move LEFT to (4, 7)\n- They could move RIGHT to (6, 7)\n\nNone of these would collide with my potential moves (4, 2), (3, 3), or (5, 3). The enemy is still far away.\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn:\n- I mentioned I could go RIGHT toward (7, 3) - only 3 moves away\n- Or continue DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n\nLet me calculate distances:\n\nFrom current position (4, 3):\n- To (7, 3): |7-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3 moves (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT)\n- To (2, 0): |2-4| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-4| + |0-3| = 3 + 3 = 6 moves\n\nEnemy at (5, 7):\n- To (7, 3): |7-5| + |3-7| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves\n- To (9, 9): |9-5| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves\n\nSince I'm at (4, 3), I can reach (7, 3) in 3 moves:\n- Turn 7: RIGHT to (5, 3)\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (6, 3)\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - APPLE!\n\nThe enemy is 6 moves away from (7, 3), so I can safely beat them to it!\n\nLet me verify that going RIGHT to (5, 3) is safe:\n- (5, 3) is empty on the board\n- Enemy head at (5, 7) - even if they move down to (5, 6), they won't reach (5, 3)\n- No wall collision\n- No body collision\n\nAfter going RIGHT to (5, 3):\n- My new body: [(4, 3), (4, 4)]\n- My options from (5, 3): UP to (5, 4) safe, DOWN to (5, 2) safe, LEFT to (4, 3) blocked by body, RIGHT to (6, 3) safe\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves\n\nThis seems like a good plan. I'll go RIGHT to (5, 3) and continue toward (7, 3).\n\nWait, let me double-check for potential head-on collisions:\n- Enemy at (5, 7), if they go DOWN repeatedly, in 4 turns they'd be at (5, 3)\n- But I'll be at (5, 3) next turn (turn 7), and then move to (6, 3) on turn 8\n- So no head-on collision risk\n\nLet me also check if LEFT to (3, 3) is good:\n- Gets me closer to (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- From (3, 3): UP to (3, 4) safe, DOWN to (3, 2) safe, LEFT to (2, 3) safe, RIGHT to (4, 3) blocked by body\n- I'd have 3 safe moves\n\nAnd DOWN to (4, 2):\n- From (4, 2): UP to (4, 3) blocked by body, DOWN to (4, 1) safe, LEFT to (3, 2) safe, RIGHT to (5, 2) safe\n- I'd have 3 safe moves\n\nAll three options give me 3 safe moves next turn. Let me think strategically:\n\nGoing RIGHT toward (7, 3):\n- I'm 3 moves from an apple\n- Enemy is 6 moves from this apple\n- Clear path with no obstacles\n\nGoing LEFT toward (2, 0) and (1, 0):\n- I'm 5-6 moves from the apples\n- But these apples are clustered, I can collect 2 quickly\n\nGoing DOWN:\n- Keeps options open but doesn't move directly toward any apple\n\nI think RIGHT is the best move because:\n1. I can get to (7, 3) in just 3 more moves\n2. I'm far enough from the enemy that there's no collision risk\n3. After getting (7, 3), I can decide whether to go for (8, 0) or head back for (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (5, 3)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (6, 3)\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - collect apple!

After getting (7, 3), I can decide whether to go for (8, 0) or head back for (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n\nLet me verify that going RIGHT to (6, 3) is safe:\n- (6, 3) is empty on the board\n- Enemy head at (4, 7) - even if they move toward me, they won't reach (6, 3)\n- No wall collision\n- No body collision\n\nAfter going RIGHT to (6, 3):\n- My new body: [(5, 3), (4, 3)]\n- My options from (6, 3): UP to (6, 4) safe, DOWN to (6, 2) safe, LEFT to (5, 3) blocked by body, RIGHT to (7, 3) safe and has APPLE!\n- So I'd have 3 safe moves, one of which gets me an apple!\n\nWait, let me also consider if the enemy might go for (7, 3):\n- Enemy at (4, 7), distance to (7, 3) is |7-4| + |3-7| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves\n- I can reach it in 2 moves\n- No way they can beat me to it!\n\nLet me also consider potential head-on collision risks:\n- Enemy at (4, 7), if they go RIGHT to (5, 7), then DOWN to (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)...\n- But I'll be at (6, 3) next turn, then (7, 3) the turn after\n- No collision risk\n\nWhat about (9, 9)?\n- From (5, 3): |9-5| + |9-3| = 4 + 6 = 10 moves\n- Enemy at (4, 7) to (9, 9): |9-4| + |9-7| = 5 + 2 = 7 moves\n- Enemy is closer to (9, 9), so they might go for that\n\nStrategic consideration:\n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 3), then RIGHT to (7, 3) to collect the apple\n- After that, from (7, 3), I could go:\n  - DOWN toward (8, 0): 3 moves\n  - Or LEFT back toward (2, 0)/(1, 0)\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. After eating the apple at (7, 3):\n- My length increases, so my body would be longer\n- From (7, 3), to (8, 0): |8-7| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 moves\n\nLet me stick with the plan. RIGHT to (6, 3) is the best move.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT to (6, 3)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - collect apple! (Score: 3)\n- Then consider going toward (8, 0) which is nearby\n- From (7, 3), go DOWN to (7, 2), then DOWN to (7, 1), then DOWN to (7, 0), then RIGHT to (8, 0)\n- Keep watching enemy position to avoid collisions\n- I'm currently winning 2-0, maintain lead!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (5, 3), body at [(4, 3), (4, 4)]. Enemy at (4, 7).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (5, 4): Safe, clear path\n- DOWN to (5, 2): Safe, clear path\n- LEFT to (4, 3): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- RIGHT to (6, 3): Safe, clear path\n\nLEFT is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn:\n- I'm now just 2 moves from the apple at (7, 3)!\n- Turn 8: RIGHT to (6, 3)\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - collect apple!\n\nEnemy at (4, 7) is 7 moves from (7, 3), so I'll easily beat them there.\n\nChecking for collision risks:\n- Enemy at (4, 7), even if they move toward me, they're too far to intercept\n- No head-on collision risk\n\nAfter RIGHT to (6, 3):\n- My body becomes [(5, 3), (4, 3)]\n- Safe options from (6, 3): UP (6, 4), DOWN (6, 2), RIGHT (7, 3) with APPLE!\n- 3 safe follow-up moves, and one leads directly to an apple\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 9: RIGHT to (7, 3) - collect apple! (Score becomes 3)\n- After that, head toward (8, 0): DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT\n- Current advantage: me at 2 apples, enemy at 0\n- Keep this lead and collect more apples efficiently\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT: (7, 3) - Valid move AND there's an APPLE here!\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (4, 6)\n- If enemy moves UP: (4, 7)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (4, 5)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (3, 6)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (5, 6)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (6, 4), (6, 2), or (7, 3).

And moves me closer to (8, 0).\n\nFrom (8, 3) [RIGHT]:\n- UP to (8, 4): Safe\n- DOWN to (8, 2): Safe\n- LEFT to (7, 3): Will be my body\n- RIGHT to (9, 3): Safe\nGood options! Also moves me closer to (8, 0).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get me closer to (8, 0). Let me think about which is better:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 2):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Then: DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Then: RIGHT to (8, 0) - apple!\nThis takes 4 moves total.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 3):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (8, 2)\n- Then: DOWN to (8, 1)\n- Then: DOWN to (8, 0) - apple!\nThis also takes 4 moves total.\n\nBoth paths are equally good for reaching (8, 0).\n\nLet me think about what happens after (8, 0):\n- After (8, 0), I could go for (9, 9) which is 9 moves away from (8, 0)\n- Or I could go for (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0) on the left side\n\nActually, wait. Let me check if going DOWN might trap me against the bottom wall. \n\nIf I go DOWN repeatedly:\n(7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0)\n\nAt (7, 0), my body would be at [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), ...growing]\nWait, I need to track my body more carefully.\n\nCurrent body: Head at (7, 3), body at [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\n\nAfter DOWN to (7, 2):\n- Head: (7, 2)\n- Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)] (tail at (4, 3) moves off since no apple eaten)\n\nAfter DOWN to (7, 1):\n- Head: (7, 1)\n- Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3)]\n\nAfter DOWN to (7, 0):\n- Head: (7, 0)\n- Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)]\n\nAfter RIGHT to (8, 0) [EAT APPLE]:\n- Head: (8, 0)\n- Body: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)] (grows!)\n\nAt (8, 0):\n- UP to (8, 1): Safe\n- DOWN to (8, -1): OUT OF BOUNDS!\n- LEFT to (7, 0): MY BODY!\n- RIGHT to (9, 0): Safe\n\nSo I'd have UP and RIGHT as options. That's fine.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's likely path:\n- Enemy at (3, 6) with 0 apples\n- Nearest apples to enemy:\n  - (3, 1): |3-3| + |1-6| = 0 + 5 = 5 moves\n  - (2, 0): |2-3| + |0-6| = 1 + 6 = 7 moves\n  - (1, 0): |1-3| + |0-6| = 2 + 6 = 8 moves\n  - (8, 0): |8-3| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11 moves\n  - (9, 9): |9-3| + |9-6| = 6 + 3 = 9 moves\n\nThe enemy might go for (3, 1) which is 5 moves away. I'm 6 moves from (3, 1) so the enemy has the advantage there.\n\nI think going for (8, 0) is still the best play since I can get there in 4 moves and the enemy is 11 moves away.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n- DOWN to (7, 2): Starts the direct path down\n- RIGHT to (8, 3): Moves to the right column first\n\nI think either is fine. Let me go with DOWN since that was my plan from last turn, and it's a straightforward path.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (7, 2)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Turn 13: RIGHT to (8, 0) - collect apple!\n- After (8, 0), options are UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0)\n- From (8, 0), consider going to (9, 9) or the left side apples\n- (9, 9) from (8, 0): UP repeatedly, then RIGHT\n- Keep tracking enemy - they might be going for (3, 1)\n- Current score advantage: 3-0, maintain lead!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (7, 3), body at [(6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]. Enemy at (3, 6).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (7, 4): Safe, clear path\n- DOWN to (7, 2): Safe, clear path\n- LEFT to (6, 3): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- RIGHT to (8, 3): Safe, clear path\n\nLEFT is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nChecking for collision risks:\n- Enemy at (3, 6) is far away (4+ cells)\n- No head-on collision possible with any of my safe moves\n\nApple distances from (7, 3):\n- (8, 0): 4 moves - closest!\n- (3, 1): 6 moves\n- (2, 0): 8 moves\n- (1, 0): 9 moves\n- (9, 9): 8 moves\n\nThe enemy at (3, 6) is closest to (3, 1) at 5 moves, so they'll likely go there. I should focus on (8, 0) which I can reach first.\n\nFollowing my plan from last turn - going DOWN to start the path to (8, 0):\n- Turn 10: DOWN to (7, 2)\n- Turn 11: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Turn 13: RIGHT to (8, 0) - collect apple!\n\nAfter reaching (8, 0), I'll have UP and RIGHT as valid options to continue.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Continue down to (7, 1), (7, 0), then right to (8, 0)\n- After (8, 0), evaluate: go for (9, 9) via UP path, or head left for the cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1)\n- Enemy likely heading to (3, 1) - avoid collision if paths cross later\n- Current score advantage: 3-0, maintain lead!\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: (8, 2) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds\n\nSo UP is eliminated - I can't go backwards into my own body.\n\nNow let me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (3, 7)\n- If enemy moves UP: (3, 8)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (3, 6)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (2, 7)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (4, 7)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (7, 1), (6, 2), or (8, 2). The enemy is quite far from me.\n\nAccording to my plan from last turn:\n- I was heading toward (8, 0)\n- From (7, 2), I planned to go DOWN to (7, 1)\n\nLet me verify the distance to apples from (7, 2):\n\nFrom (7, 2):\n- To (8, 0): |8-7| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves\n  - Path: DOWN to (7, 1), DOWN to (7, 0), RIGHT to (8, 0)\n- To (3, 1): |3-7| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves\n- To (2, 0): |2-7| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7 moves\n- To (1, 0): |1-7| + |0-2| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves\n- To (9, 9): |9-7| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9 moves\n\nThe closest apple is (8, 0) at 3 moves.\n\nLet me check what options I have from each possible move:\n\nFrom (7, 1) [DOWN]:\n- UP to (7, 2): Will be where my head was, which will be body - wait, let me think...\n  - After I move to (7, 1), my body becomes [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3)] (tail at (5, 3) moves off)\n  - So UP to (7, 2) would hit my body\n- DOWN to (7, 0): Safe\n- LEFT to (6, 1): Safe\n- RIGHT to (8, 1): Safe\nGood options! And moves me closer to (8, 0).\n\nFrom (6, 2) [LEFT]:\n- UP to (6, 3): Will be my body!\n- DOWN to (6, 1): Safe\n- LEFT to (5, 2): Safe\n- RIGHT to (7, 2): Will be my body after I move!\nLimited options after LEFT.

Also moves me closer to (8, 0).\n\nLet me compare DOWN vs RIGHT:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Then: RIGHT to (8, 0) - apple!\nThis takes 3 moves total.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 2):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (8, 1)\n- Then: DOWN to (8, 0) - apple!\nThis also takes 3 moves total.\n\nBoth paths are equally good for reaching (8, 0).\n\nLet me think about what happens after (8, 0):\n\nIf I follow the DOWN path:\n(7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0)\n\nAt (7, 0), my body would be at [(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)]\nAfter RIGHT to (8, 0) [EAT APPLE]:\n- Head: (8, 0)\n- Body: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)] (grows!)\n\nAt (8, 0):\n- UP to (8, 1): Safe\n- DOWN to (8, -1): OUT OF BOUNDS!\n- LEFT to (7, 0): MY BODY!\n- RIGHT to (9, 0): Safe\n\nSo I'd have UP and RIGHT as options.

That's also fine.\n\nBoth approaches work. Let me continue with the DOWN path as that was my original plan.\n\nLet me also consider the enemy:\n- Enemy at (3, 7) with 0 apples\n- Nearest apples to enemy:\n  - (3, 1): |3-3| + |1-7| = 0 + 6 = 6 moves\n  - (2, 0): |2-3| + |0-7| = 1 + 7 = 8 moves\n  - (1, 0): |1-3| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9 moves\n  - (8, 0): |8-3| + |0-7| = 5 + 7 = 12 moves\n  - (9, 9): |9-3| + |9-7| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves\n\nThe enemy might go for (3, 1) which is 6 moves away, or (9, 9) which is 8 moves but more toward the top-right. I'm 3 moves from (8, 0) so I have a significant advantage.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (7, 1)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 12: DOWN to (7, 0)\n- Turn 13: RIGHT to (8, 0) - collect apple!\n- After (8, 0), options are UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0)\n- From (8, 0), consider going to (9, 9) via UP and RIGHT\n- Or head left for the cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1)\n- Keep tracking enemy - they're likely heading toward (3, 1) or (9, 9)\n- Current score advantage: 3-0, maintain lead!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (7, 2), body at [(7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)].

(Score: 4-0)\n- After (8, 0), options are UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0)\n- From there, consider heading toward (9, 9) via UP/RIGHT movements\n- Or head left toward the cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1)\n- Keep tracking enemy position\n- Current score advantage: 3-0, maintain lead!\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (7, 1), body at [(7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3)]. Enemy at (4, 7).\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (7, 2): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- DOWN to (7, 0): Safe, clear path\n- LEFT to (6, 1): Safe, clear path\n- RIGHT to (8, 1): Safe, clear path\n\nUP is eliminated - can't go into my own body.\n\nApple distances from (7, 1):\n- (8, 0): 2 moves - closest! \n- (3, 1): 4 moves\n- (2, 0): 6 moves\n- (1, 0): 7 moves\n- (9, 9): 10 moves\n\nFollowing my plan - continuing toward (8, 0):\n\nFrom (7, 0) after going DOWN:\n- RIGHT to (8, 0): Apple! \u2713\n- LEFT to (6, 0): Safe\n- UP/DOWN: blocked by body or out of bounds\n\nFrom (8, 1) after going RIGHT:\n- DOWN to (8, 0): Apple! \u2713\n- UP to (8, 2): Safe\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): Safe\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get me to the apple in 2 moves. Going with DOWN as planned - it keeps me closer to the bottom row where there's an apple cluster (1,0), (2,0).\n\nEnemy at (4, 7) is far away - no collision risk for several turns.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 13: RIGHT to (8, 0) - collect apple! (Score: 4-0)\n- After (8, 0), decide between UP toward (9, 9) or LEFT toward bottom apple cluster\n- Maintain score advantage over enemy!\n\nDOWN",

I would die!\n4. RIGHT: (9, 0) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds. Safe!\n\nSo I can only go UP or RIGHT. DOWN kills me (out of bounds), LEFT kills me (my body).\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (5, 8)\n- If enemy moves UP: (5, 9)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (5, 7)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (4, 8)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 8)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (8, 1) or (9, 0).

That's a corner trap!\n\nUP is clearly better - I have 2 safe follow-up moves instead of just 1.\n\nLet me think about strategy:\n\nThe closest apples from my current position (8, 0) are:\n- (3, 1): |3-8| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves\n- (2, 0): |2-8| + |0-0| = 6 + 0 = 6 moves\n- (1, 0): |1-8| + |0-0| = 7 + 0 = 7 moves\n- (9, 9): |9-8| + |9-0| = 1 + 9 = 10 moves\n- (0, 7): |0-8| + |7-0| = 8 + 7 = 15 moves\n\nThe bottom row apples (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1) are clustered together. After going UP to (8, 1), I should head LEFT toward them.\n\nActually wait - if I go RIGHT to (9, 0), then UP to (9, 1), I could then head toward (9, 9) which is an apple. Let me reconsider...\n\nFrom (9, 0) after going RIGHT:\n- Only option is UP to (9, 1)\nFrom (9, 1):\n- UP to (9, 2): Safe\n- DOWN to (9, 0): My body!\n- LEFT to (8, 1): Safe\n- RIGHT to (10, 1): OUT OF BOUNDS!\nSo from (9, 1) I'd have 2 options.\n\nHmm, it's not as bad as I thought, but getting cornered in the right side is risky. Going UP gives me more flexibility to head LEFT toward the apple cluster or keep options open.\n\nLet me trace a path to the apple cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1):\n\nFrom (8, 0):\n- UP to (8, 1)\n- Then LEFT several times: (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1) - APPLE!\n- Then DOWN to (3, 0) or LEFT to (2, 1)\n- etc.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful of my own body. Let me trace more carefully.\n\nAfter UP to (8, 1):\n- My body: Head at (8, 1), body at [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n\nFrom (8, 1):\n- If I go LEFT to (7, 1), that's where my tail segment is! \n\nWait, let me re-check. After I move UP:\n- Old head was at (8, 0)\n- New head is at (8, 1)\n- Body moves: old head (8, 0) becomes first body segment\n- Old body: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)]\n- Since I didn't eat an apple, tail (7, 3) drops off\n- New body: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n\nSo from (8, 1), if I try to go LEFT to (7, 1), that's my body! Blocked.\nIf I go UP to (8, 2), that's safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 1), that's safe.\n\nHmm, so after UP, I need to continue UP or RIGHT before I can eventually go LEFT.\n\nLet me trace:\nTurn 14: UP to (8, 1), body: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\nTurn 15: UP to (8, 2), body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)]\nTurn 16: UP to (8, 3) or LEFT to (7, 2)? (7, 2) is my tail... need to check.\n\nAfter Turn 15, body is [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)], so (7, 2) is free!\nTurn 16: LEFT to (7, 2), body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]\nTurn 17: LEFT to (6, 2) or DOWN to (7, 1) or UP to (7, 3). (7, 1) is my body? No wait, let me re-check.\n\nAfter Turn 16, body is [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)], so (7, 0) drops off.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me just focus on the immediate decision.\n\nUP to (8, 1) is better than RIGHT to (9, 0) because:\n1. From (8, 1), I have 2 safe moves (UP and RIGHT)\n2. From (9, 0), I only have 1 safe move (UP) and I'm cornered\n\nGoing UP keeps more options open.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 14: UP to (8, 1) - keeps options open\n- Turn 15: UP to (8, 2) - continue moving away from my body\n- Turn 16+: Start heading LEFT toward the apple cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1)\n- Current score advantage: 4-0, maintain lead by safely collecting more apples\n- Enemy at (5, 8) is far away, likely going for (0, 7) or (9, 9)\n\nDecision: UP\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (8, 0), body at [(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (8, 1): Safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN to (8, -1): DEADLY - out of bounds!\n- LEFT to (7, 0): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- RIGHT to (9, 0): Safe, but corner position\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are valid moves.\n\nComparing the options:\n- UP to (8, 1): After moving, from (8, 1) I can go UP to (8, 2) or RIGHT to (9, 1). LEFT to (7, 1) would be my body, DOWN to (8, 0) would be my body. **2 safe follow-up moves**.\n- RIGHT to (9, 0): After moving, from (9, 0) I can only go UP to (9, 1). DOWN is out of bounds, LEFT is my body, RIGHT is out of bounds. **Only 1 safe follow-up move** - corner trap!\n\nUP is clearly better - I maintain flexibility with 2 escape routes instead of getting cornered.\n\nEnemy at (5, 8) is far away - no collision risk.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 14: UP to (8, 1) - keeps options open \u2713\n- Turn 15: UP to (8, 2) - continue moving away from my body\n- Turn 16+: Start heading LEFT toward the apple cluster at (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1)\n- Current score advantage: 4-0, maintain lead by safely collecting more apples\n\nUP",

UP: (8, 2) - Is there any body there? No. Is it out of bounds? No. Safe!\n2. DOWN: (8, 0) - This is where my body is! I would die!\n3. LEFT: (7, 1) - This is where my body is! I would die!\n4. RIGHT: (9, 1) - Valid move, no obstacles, within bounds. Safe!\n\nSo I can only go UP or RIGHT. DOWN and LEFT are blocked by my body.\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (5, 7)\n- If enemy moves UP: (5, 8)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (5, 6)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (4, 7)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 7)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (8, 2) or (9, 1). The enemy is far from me.\n\nNow let me compare UP vs RIGHT:\n\nUP to (8, 2):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)] (tail at (7, 2) moves off)\n- From (8, 2):\n  - UP to (8, 3): Safe\n  - DOWN to (8, 1): My body!\n  - LEFT to (7, 2): Let's check - (7, 2) was tail, it drops off, so it's safe!\n  - RIGHT to (9, 2): Safe\nSo I'd have 3 safe options from (8, 2).\n\nRIGHT to (9, 1):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)] (tail at (7, 2) moves off)\n- From (9, 1):\n  - UP to (9, 2): Safe\n  - DOWN to (9, 0): Safe\n  - LEFT to (8, 1): My body!\n  - RIGHT to (10, 1): OUT OF BOUNDS!\nSo I'd have 2 safe options from (9, 1).\n\nUP gives me 3 follow-up options vs 2 for RIGHT. UP is better.\n\nLet me also think about apple strategy:\n\nThe closest apples from my current position (8, 1) are:\n- (3, 1): |3-8| + |1-1| = 5 moves - same row!\n- (2, 0): |2-8| + |0-1| = 6 + 1 = 7 moves\n- (1, 0): |1-8| + |0-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves\n- (9, 9): |9-8| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9 moves\n- (0, 7): |0-8| + |7-1| = 8 + 6 = 14 moves\n\nThe apple at (3, 1) is closest and on the same row! If I go UP now, I can later go LEFT toward it.\n\nActually wait - if I go RIGHT to (9, 1), then I could also head LEFT toward (3, 1). But going UP gives me more flexibility.\n\nLet me trace a path toward (3, 1):\n\nFrom (8, 1):\n- UP to (8, 2)\n- Then LEFT to (7, 2) - my body will have moved\n- Then DOWN to (7, 1)? Let me check if that's blocked...\n\nActually, let me trace more carefully step by step:\n\nTurn 15 (current): Head at (8, 1), body at [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\nIf I go UP to (8, 2): New body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)]\n\nTurn 16: Head at (8, 2), body at [(8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1)]\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 2): New body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]\n(7, 2) is safe because (7, 1) drops off as the tail.\n\nTurn 17: Head at (7, 2), body at [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]\nOptions: UP to (7, 3), DOWN to (7, 1), LEFT to (6, 2), RIGHT to (8, 2) - blocked!\nDOWN to (7, 1)? Let me check - (7, 0) will drop off, so (7, 1) would be blocked by... nothing actually. Wait, my body is [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)], so (7, 1) is free!\n\nTurn 17: If I go DOWN to (7, 1): New body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n\nTurn 18: Head at (7, 1), body at [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\nOptions: LEFT to (6, 1), UP to (7, 2) - blocked!, DOWN to (7, 0)? (8, 0) will drop, so (7, 0) needs to be checked - it will have dropped by now too actually.\n\nWait, I need to track more carefully. After turn 17, when I move to (7, 1):\n- New head: (7, 1)\n- Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- Tail (7, 0) dropped\n\nAfter turn 18, if I'm at (7, 1) and go LEFT to (6, 1):\n- New head: (6, 1)\n- Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]\n- Tail (8, 0) dropped\n\nTurn 19: Head at (6, 1), body at [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]\nContinue LEFT to (5, 1): New body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2)]\n\nTurn 20: Head at (5, 1), body at [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2)]\nContinue LEFT to (4, 1): New body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n\nTurn 21: Head at (4, 1), body at [(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\nContinue LEFT to (3, 1): APPLE! Body grows: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n\nSo the path is: UP, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT to reach (3, 1).\nThat's 7 moves to get to (3, 1), and I'll collect an apple.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about going RIGHT toward (9, 9):\n\nFrom (8, 1):\n- RIGHT to (9, 1)\n- UP to (9, 2)\n- UP to (9, 3)\n- ... continuing UP 7 more times to (9, 9) - APPLE!\n\nThat's 9 moves to (9, 9).\n\nSo going LEFT toward (3, 1) is faster (7 moves) than going RIGHT toward (9, 9) (9 moves).\n\nBut I'm also ahead 4-0, so I should play safely. UP gives me more flexibility.\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 7) and likely going for (0, 7) since it's close. They're not threatening me.\n\nDecision: UP to (8, 2) - keeps the most options open and starts my path toward the apple cluster at (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 15: UP to (8, 2) \u2713\n- Turn 16: LEFT to (7, 2)\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Turn 18+: Continue LEFT toward (3, 1), then (2, 0), (1, 0)\n- Maintain 4-0 lead by safely collecting more apples\n- Enemy likely going for (0, 7) - not a threat\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (8, 1), body at [(8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (8, 2): Safe, no obstacles\n- DOWN to (8, 0): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- LEFT to (7, 1): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): Safe, no obstacles\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are valid moves.\n\nComparing the options:\n- UP to (8, 2): After moving, from (8, 2) I can go UP to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 2) (tail drops off), or RIGHT to (9, 2). **3 safe follow-up moves**.\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): After moving, from (9, 1) I can go UP to (9, 2) or DOWN to (9, 0). LEFT would be my body, RIGHT is out of bounds. **Only 2 safe follow-up moves**.\n\nUP is clearly better - more flexibility.\n\nApple strategy: The apple at (3, 1) is on the same row and only 5 cells away horizontally. After going UP, I can path: LEFT to (7,2), DOWN to (7,1), then LEFT repeatedly to reach (3, 1).\n\nEnemy at (5, 7) is far away and likely heading toward (0, 7) - no threat.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 15: UP to (8, 2) \u2713\n- Turn 16: LEFT to (7, 2) - tail drops, this becomes safe\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Turn 18+: Continue LEFT toward apple cluster at (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)\n- Maintain 4-0 lead safely\n\nUP",

UP: (7, 3) - Is there any body there? My body is [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]. (7, 3) is not in there. Safe!\n2. DOWN: (7, 1) - Is (7, 1) in my body? No, it's not. Safe!\n3. LEFT: (6, 2) - Is (6, 2) in my body? No. Safe!\n4. RIGHT: (8, 2) - This is where my body is! I would die!\n\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. RIGHT is blocked by my body at (8, 2).\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (5, 7)\n- If enemy moves UP: (5, 8)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (5, 6)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (4, 7)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 7)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (7, 3), (7, 1), or (6, 2). The enemy is far from me.\n\nNow let me compare the three options:\n\nUP to (7, 3):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)] (tail at (7, 0) moves off)\n- From (7, 3):\n  - UP to (7, 4): Safe\n  - DOWN to (7, 2): Would be my body!\n  - LEFT to (6, 3): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (8, 3): Safe\nSo I'd have 3 safe options from (7, 3).\n\nDOWN to (7, 1):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)] (tail at (7, 0) moves off)\n- From (7, 1):\n  - UP to (7, 2): Would be my body!\n  - DOWN to (7, 0): Was tail, now free. Safe!\n  - LEFT to (6, 1): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (8, 1): Would be my body!\nSo I'd have 2 safe options from (7, 1).\n\nLEFT to (6, 2):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)] (tail at (7, 0) moves off)\n- From (6, 2):\n  - UP to (6, 3): Safe\n  - DOWN to (6, 1): Safe\n  - LEFT to (5, 2): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (7, 2): Would be my body!\nSo I'd have 3 safe options from (6, 2).\n\nUP and LEFT both give me 3 follow-up options, while DOWN only gives 2.\n\nNow let me think about apple strategy:\n\nFrom my current position (7, 2), closest apples:\n- (3, 1): |3-7| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves\n- (2, 0): |2-7| + |0-2| = 5 + 2 = 7 moves\n- (1, 0): |1-7| + |0-2| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves\n- (9, 9): |9-7| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9 moves\n- (0, 7): |0-7| + |7-2| = 7 + 5 = 12 moves\n\nThe apple at (3, 1) is closest! \n\nAccording to my previous plan:\n- Turn 16: LEFT to (7, 2) \u2713 (done)\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1)\n- Turn 18+: Continue LEFT toward (3, 1), then (2, 0), (1, 0)\n\nSo this turn (Turn 17) I should go DOWN to (7, 1)!\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. DOWN gives me only 2 follow-up options while LEFT gives 3. Let me think about the path more carefully.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1):\n- Next turn from (7, 1), I'd want to go LEFT to (6, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE!\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2):\n- Next turn from (6, 2), I could go DOWN to (6, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Then LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE!\n\nBoth paths have the same length to the apple! But LEFT now gives me more flexibility.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the DOWN path more carefully.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 1):\n- My body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- From (7, 1), I can go:\n  - DOWN to (7, 0): This was my tail, now free. Safe!\n  - LEFT to (6, 1): Safe!\n\nHmm, but if I go DOWN to (7, 0), I'm going away from the apples. So really only LEFT makes sense from (7, 1).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 2):\n- My body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- From (6, 2), I can go:\n  - UP to (6, 3): Away from apples but more options\n  - DOWN to (6, 1): Toward apples\n  - LEFT to (5, 2): Also toward apples\n\nLEFT gives me more flexibility and essentially the same path length to the apples.\n\nLet me reconsider: My goal is to get to (3, 1) efficiently.\n\nFrom (7, 2):\n- Path via DOWN: (7, 2) -> DOWN to (7, 1) -> LEFT to (6, 1) -> LEFT to (5, 1) -> LEFT to (4, 1) -> LEFT to (3, 1) = 5 moves\n- Path via LEFT: (7, 2) -> LEFT to (6, 2) -> DOWN to (6, 1) -> LEFT to (5, 1) -> LEFT to (4, 1) -> LEFT to (3, 1) = 5 moves\n\nSame distance! But LEFT gives more flexibility if something unexpected happens.\n\nActually, let me check if there's a direct path. From (7, 2), I need to get to (3, 1).\n- Delta x: 7 - 3 = 4 (need to go LEFT 4 times)\n- Delta y: 2 - 1 = 1 (need to go DOWN 1 time)\n\nIf I go LEFT first:\n(7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) = 5 moves\n\nIf I go DOWN first:\n(7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) = 5 moves\n\nSame! But following the row at y=1 might be slightly better since there's also an apple at (2, 0) and (1, 0) nearby.\n\nWait, let me check if my body would be in the way for either path.\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (7, 1):\n- Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- Next move LEFT to (6, 1): Not blocked\n- Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]\n- Next move LEFT to (5, 1): Not blocked\n- Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2)]\n- Next move LEFT to (4, 1): Not blocked\n- Body: [(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n- Next move LEFT to (3, 1): APPLE! Body grows: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (6, 2):\n- Body: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- Next move LEFT to (5, 2): Not blocked\n- Body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]\n- Next move LEFT to (4, 2): Not blocked\n- Body: [(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2)]\n- Next move LEFT to (3, 2): Not blocked\n- Body: [(4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]\n- Next move DOWN to (3, 1): APPLE! Body grows: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2)]\n\nBoth paths work! But let me think about what happens after getting the apple at (3, 1).\n\nAfter the DOWN path, my snake is in row y=1, lined up perfectly to continue LEFT to (2, 0) and (1, 0).\n\nAfter the LEFT path (via y=2), my snake is in row y=2, and I need to go DOWN to get to the remaining apples.\n\nThe DOWN path seems more efficient for collecting multiple apples!\n\nLet me verify the continuation after DOWN path:\n- At (3, 1) with body [(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]\n- Go DOWN to (3, 0): Not an apple, but gets me closer\n- Wait, (3, 0) is not an apple. Apples are at (2, 0) and (1, 0).\n- Actually, I should go LEFT from (3, 1) to (2, 1), then DOWN to (2, 0) for the apple.\n\nHmm, let me reconsider. From (3, 1):\n- LEFT to (2, 1): Not blocked by body\n- DOWN to (2, 0): APPLE!\n- LEFT to (1, 0): APPLE!\n\nOK, I can continue collecting apples efficiently from either path.\n\nGiven that both paths work and DOWN follows my previous plan, I'll go with DOWN.\n\nWait, I should double-check if DOWN (to 7, 1) is actually safe. My body is at [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]. Is (7, 1) in that list? No, it's not. Safe!\n\nActually, looking at the board again:\n```\n 2 . . . . . . . 1 T .\n 1 . . . A . . . . T .\n 0 . A A . . . . T T .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nThe T at (7, 0) is my tail. After I move, the tail drops. So (7, 0) will be free after this turn.\n\nGoing DOWN to (7, 1):\n- (7, 1) is not my body, it's empty.\n- After moving, body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- Tail at (7, 0) drops off and becomes free.\n\nThis is safe!\n\nDecision: DOWN to (7, 1) - follows my planned path toward the apple cluster.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1) \u2713\n- Turn 18: LEFT to (6, 1)\n- Turn 19: LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Turn 20: LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Turn 21: LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE! (Score: 5)\n- Turn 22: LEFT to (2, 1)\n- Turn 23: DOWN to (2, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 6)\n- Turn 24: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 7)\n- Maintain lead over enemy (currently 4-0)\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current situation:\n\nMy head is at (7, 2), body at [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (7, 3): Safe - not in my body\n- DOWN to (7, 1): Safe - not in my body\n- LEFT to (6, 2): Safe - not in my body\n- RIGHT to (8, 2): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n\nThree valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nComparing options for flexibility:\n- UP to (7, 3): 3 follow-up options\n- DOWN to (7, 1): 2 follow-up options (UP is body, but DOWN to (7,0) is free since tail drops)\n- LEFT to (6, 2): 3 follow-up options\n\nFollowing my planned path toward the apple cluster at (3, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0):\n\nThe apple at (3, 1) is 5 moves away. Going DOWN puts me on row y=1, which is the same row as the apple at (3, 1) and directly above (2, 0) and (1, 0). This aligns me perfectly for collecting multiple apples!\n\nPath verification:\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1) - body becomes [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]\n- Turn 18: LEFT to (6, 1)\n- Turn 19: LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Turn 20: LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Turn 21: LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE!\n- Continue to (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n\nEnemy at (5, 7) is far away and likely heading toward (0, 7). No collision risk.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 17: DOWN to (7, 1) \u2713\n- Turn 18-21: Continue LEFT along y=1 to reach (3, 1)\n- Turn 22-24: Continue to (2, 0) and (1, 0)\n- Maintain 4-0 lead safely\n\nDOWN",

UP and RIGHT are blocked by my own body.\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (5, 6)\n- If enemy moves UP: (5, 7)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (5, 5)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (4, 6)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 6)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (7, 0) or (6, 1). The enemy is far from me.\n\nNow let me compare the two options:\n\nDOWN to (7, 0):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)] (tail at (8, 0) moves off)\n- From (7, 0):\n  - UP to (7, 1): Would be my body!\n  - DOWN: Out of bounds! (y would be -1)\n  - LEFT to (6, 0): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (8, 0): Would that be my body? After this move, body is [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)]. (8, 0) is not in there, so it would be safe.\nSo I'd have 2 safe options from (7, 0).\n\nLEFT to (6, 1):\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1)] (tail at (8, 0) moves off)\n- From (6, 1):\n  - UP to (6, 2): Safe\n  - DOWN to (6, 0): Safe\n  - LEFT to (5, 1): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (7, 1): Would be my body!\nSo I'd have 3 safe options from (6, 1).\n\nLEFT gives me more flexibility!\n\nAlso, according to my planned path toward the apple at (3, 1):\n- Turn 18: LEFT to (6, 1) \u2713\n- Turn 19: LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Turn 20: LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Turn 21: LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE!\n\nThis is exactly following my plan! LEFT takes me toward the apple cluster.\n\nDOWN takes me away from the apples and toward the corner, which is less ideal.\n\nLet me verify LEFT is safe:\n- (6, 1) is not my body (body is at [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)])\n- (6, 1) is within the board\n- Enemy head at (5, 6) cannot reach (6, 1) in one move\n\nLEFT is safe and follows my planned path!\n\nDecision: LEFT to (6, 1)\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 18: LEFT to (6, 1) \u2713\n- Turn 19: LEFT to (5, 1)\n- Turn 20: LEFT to (4, 1)\n- Turn 21: LEFT to (3, 1) - APPLE! (Score: 5)\n- Turn 22: LEFT to (2, 1)\n- Turn 23: DOWN to (2, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 6)\n- Turn 24: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE!

UP: (4, 2) - Is there any body there? My body is [(5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2)]. (4, 2) is not in my body. Safe!\n2. DOWN: (4, 0) - Is (4, 0) in my body? No. Safe!\n3.

AND there's an APPLE here!\n3. LEFT: (1, 1) - Is (1, 1) in my body? No. Safe!\n4. RIGHT: (3, 1) - Is (3, 1) in my body? Yes! My body includes (3, 1). DEADLY!\n\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. RIGHT is blocked by my own body.\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (5, 5)\n- If enemy moves UP: (5, 6)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (5, 4)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (4, 5)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (6, 5)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (2, 2), (2, 0), or (1, 1). The enemy is far from me.\n\nAccording to my plan from last turn:\n- Turn 23: DOWN to (2, 0) - APPLE! (Score: 6)\n\nThis is exactly what I should do! Let me verify:\n\nDOWN to (2, 0):\n- APPLE here! I'll get my 6th apple.\n- After moving and eating, my body becomes [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)] (tail doesn't move off because I ate)\n- From (2, 0):\n  - UP to (2, 1): Would be my new body! DEADLY\n  - DOWN to (2, -1): Out of bounds! DEADLY\n  - LEFT to (1, 0): Safe - AND there's an APPLE here!\n  - RIGHT to (3, 0): Safe\n\nSo after eating at (2, 0), I can go LEFT to (1, 0) for another apple!\n\nLet me double check the other options:\n\nUP to (2, 2):\n- No apple\n- Takes me away from the apple cluster at bottom\n- Not optimal\n\nLEFT to (1, 1):\n- No apple\n- After moving, my body becomes [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)] (tail at (7, 1) moves off)\n- From (1, 1):\n  - UP to (1, 2): Safe\n  - DOWN to (1, 0): Safe - APPLE!\n  - LEFT to (0, 1): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (2, 1): Would be my new body!\n\nIf I go LEFT now, I can still get to (1, 0) next turn, but I miss the apple at (2, 0). That's not optimal.\n\nBest move: DOWN to (2, 0) to collect the apple!\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 23: DOWN to (2, 0) - APPLE!

If I go RIGHT to (3, 0), then from (3, 0):\n- UP to (3, 1): My body would be [(3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]. So (3, 1) is still in my body! DEADLY\n- DOWN: Out of bounds\n- LEFT to (2, 0): My body! DEADLY\n- RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe\n\nSo if I go RIGHT, I only have one option next turn (RIGHT again). That's risky.\n\nLet me verify LEFT to (1, 0) again:\n- APPLE! Score becomes 7\n- My new body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1)]\n- From (1, 0):\n  - UP to (1, 1): Is (1, 1) in my body? No!

DEADLY\n\nSo after LEFT, I have 2 options (UP or LEFT), which is better than RIGHT which gives me only 1 option.\n\nBest move: LEFT to (1, 0) to collect the apple and maintain more options!\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 24: LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE!

T T . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nMy head is at (1, 1), and my body is at [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)].\n\nLet me check the four directions:\n\n1. UP: (1, 2) - Is (1, 2) in my body? Let me check: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]. No, (1, 2) is not in my body. Safe!\n\n2. DOWN: (1, 0) - Is (1, 0) in my body? Yes! (1, 0) is directly behind my head. DEADLY!\n\n3. LEFT: (0, 1) - Is (0, 1) in my body? No. Safe!\n\n4. RIGHT: (2, 1) - Is (2, 1) in my body? Yes! (2, 1) is in my body. DEADLY!\n\nSo I can only go UP or LEFT. DOWN would be going backwards into my body, RIGHT is blocked by my own body.\n\nLet me check for enemy collision risks:\n- Enemy head at (4, 5)\n- If enemy moves UP: (4, 6)\n- If enemy moves DOWN: (4, 4)\n- If enemy moves LEFT: (3, 5)\n- If enemy moves RIGHT: (5, 5)\n\nNone of these positions would collide with my potential moves: (1, 2) or (0, 1). The enemy is far from me.\n\nLet me evaluate the two options:\n\n**UP to (1, 2):**\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (tail at (6, 1) moves off)\n- From (1, 2):\n  - UP to (1, 3): Is (1, 3) in my new body? No. Safe!\n  - DOWN to (1, 1): Is (1, 1) in my new body? Yes! DEADLY\n  - LEFT to (0, 2): Is (0, 2) in my new body? No. Safe! APPLE at (0, 2)!\n  - RIGHT to (2, 2): Is (2, 2) in my new body? No. Safe!\n\nSo from (1, 2), I have 3 options: UP, LEFT (apple!), or RIGHT. Great!\n\n**LEFT to (0, 1):**\n- No apple here\n- After moving, my body becomes [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] (tail at (6, 1) moves off)\n- From (0, 1):\n  - UP to (0, 2): Is (0, 2) in my new body? No. Safe! APPLE at (0, 2)!\n  - DOWN to (0, 0): Is (0, 0) in my new body? No. Safe!\n  - LEFT to (-1, 1): Out of bounds! DEADLY\n  - RIGHT to (1, 1): Is (1, 1) in my new body? Yes! DEADLY\n\nSo from (0, 1), I have 2 options: UP (apple!) or DOWN.\n\nActually, both paths get me to the apple at (0, 2) in 2 moves!\n\nPath A: UP to (1, 2) \u2192 LEFT to (0, 2) APPLE!\nPath B: LEFT to (0, 1) \u2192 UP to (0, 2) APPLE!\n\nUP gives me more options (3 vs 2), so UP is slightly better.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. From my last rationale, my plan was:\n- Turn 25: UP to (1, 1) \u2713 (done)\n- Turn 26: LEFT to (0, 1) - head toward (0, 2) apple\n- Turn 27: UP to (0, 2) - APPLE!\n\nBut now I'm reconsidering. Going UP to (1, 2) first actually gives me more options! Let me think about what happens after eating the apple.\n\nIf I go UP now to (1, 2), then LEFT to (0, 2) to eat the apple:\n- After eating apple, my body grows to 9 segments\n- From (0, 2), I can go:\n  - UP to (0, 3): Safe\n  - DOWN to (0, 1): Would be in my body? Need to check\n  - LEFT to (-1, 2): Out of bounds\n  - RIGHT to (1, 2): Would be in my body? Need to check\n\nActually, let me trace this more carefully.\n\nCurrent body (8 segments): Head at (1, 1), body at [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\n\nAfter UP to (1, 2) (no apple):\n- Head: (1, 2)\n- Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Tail (6, 1) falls off\n\nAfter LEFT to (0, 2) eating apple:\n- Head: (0, 2)\n- Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] - body grows by 1 so tail stays\n- From (0, 2):\n  - UP to (0, 3): Not in body. Safe!\n  - DOWN to (0, 1): Not in body. Safe!\n  - LEFT: Out of bounds\n  - RIGHT to (1, 2): In body! DEADLY\n\nSo after eating the apple, I have 2 options: UP or DOWN.\n\nNow let's check the alternative path:\n\nAfter LEFT to (0, 1) (no apple):\n- Head: (0, 1)\n- Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Tail (6, 1) falls off\n\nAfter UP to (0, 2) eating apple:\n- Head: (0, 2)\n- Body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)] - body grows\n- From (0, 2):\n  - UP to (0, 3): Not in body. Safe!\n  - DOWN to (0, 1): In body! DEADLY\n  - LEFT: Out of bounds\n  - RIGHT to (1, 2): Not in body. Safe!\n\nInteresting! With the LEFT-then-UP path, after eating the apple I have options: UP or RIGHT.\nWith the UP-then-LEFT path, after eating the apple I have options: UP or DOWN.\n\nBoth give 2 options after eating the apple. But let me think further...\n\nActually, going UP now keeps me more centered and gives me more immediate options next turn (3 vs 2). I'll go with UP.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 26: UP to (1, 2) \u2713 (this turn)\n- Turn 27: LEFT to (0, 2) - APPLE! (Score: 8)\n- Turn 28: UP to (0, 3) - continue toward (0, 7) apple\n- Continue collecting apples along the left edge\n\nBest move: UP\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\nMy head is at (1, 1), body at [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (1, 2): Safe - not in my body\n- DOWN to (1, 0): DEADLY - that's my own body (directly behind head)!\n- LEFT to (0, 1): Safe - not in my body\n- RIGHT to (2, 1): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n\nOnly two valid moves: UP or LEFT.\n\nComparing the options:\n\nUP to (1, 2):\n- From (1, 2), I can go UP to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 2) [APPLE!], or RIGHT to (2, 2) - 3 options\n\nLEFT to (0, 1):\n- From (0, 1), I can go UP to (0, 2) [APPLE!] or DOWN to (0, 0) - only 2 options (LEFT is wall, RIGHT is body)\n\nUP gives me more flexibility! Both paths reach the apple at (0, 2) in 2 moves.\n\nThe enemy at (4, 5) is far away with no collision risk.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 26: UP to (1, 2) \u2713 (this turn)\n- Turn 27: LEFT to (0, 2) - APPLE! (Score: 8)\n- Turn 28: UP to (0, 3) - head toward (0, 7) apple\n- Turn 29+: Continue up the left edge toward (0, 7), then (1, 8)\n- Dominating 7-0, keep collecting safely!\n\nUP",

DEADLY\n\nActually wait, after I move to (0, 0), my tail would move. Let me trace more carefully:\n\nTurn 28 (current): Head at (0, 2), body is [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 1):\n- New head: (0, 1)\n- New body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n- Tail (5, 1) fell off\n\nTurn 29: Head at (0, 1), body is [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0):\n- New head: (0, 0)\n- New body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n- Tail (4, 1) fell off\n\nTurn 30: Head at (0, 0), body is [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n\nOptions from (0, 0):\n- UP to (0, 1): (0, 1) is in body! DEADLY\n- DOWN to (0, -1): Out of bounds! DEADLY\n- LEFT to (-1, 0): Out of bounds! DEADLY\n- RIGHT to (1, 0): (1, 0) is in body! DEADLY\n\nSo going DOWN leads to being trapped and dying in 2 moves!\n\n**UP is the only viable option!**\n\nLet me verify UP is safe:\n\nIf I go UP to (0, 3):\n- New head: (0, 3)\n- New body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n- Tail (5, 1) fell off\n\nTurn 29: Head at (0, 3), body is [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n\nOptions from (0, 3):\n- UP to (0, 4): Not in body.

But they're nowhere near my path.\n\nBest move: UP\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\nMy head is at (0, 2), body at [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (0, 3): Safe - not in my body\n- DOWN to (0, 1): Safe - not in my body\n- LEFT to (-1, 2): DEADLY - out of bounds!\n- RIGHT to (1, 2): DEADLY - that's my own body!\n\nOnly two valid moves: UP or DOWN.\n\nLet me think ahead about DOWN:\n- Going DOWN to (0, 1), then DOWN to (0, 0) would trap me in the corner\n- From (0, 0), all directions would be blocked: LEFT/DOWN out of bounds, UP/RIGHT into my own body\n- This is a death trap in 2 moves!\n\nGoing UP to (0, 3):\n- From (0, 3), I can continue UP to (0, 4) or go RIGHT to (1, 3)\n- This keeps multiple escape routes open\n- I can continue up the left edge toward the apple at (0, 7)\n\nThe apple at (0, 7) is 5 moves away via the left edge.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 28: UP to (0, 3) \u2713\n- Turn 29: UP to (0, 4)\n- Turn 30-31: Continue UP to (0, 5), (0, 6)\n- Turn 32: UP to (0, 7) - APPLE!

UP: (0, 4) - Is (0, 4) in my body? No. Safe!\n\n2. DOWN: (0, 2) - Is (0, 2) in my body? Yes! (0, 2) is the first segment of my body. DEADLY!\n\n3. LEFT: (-1, 3) - Out of bounds! DEADLY!\n\n4. RIGHT: (1, 3) - Is (1, 3) in my body? No. Safe!\n\nSo I can only go UP or RIGHT. LEFT is out of bounds, DOWN is into my own body.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**UP to (0, 4):**\n- No apple at (0, 4)\n- After moving, my body becomes [(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n- Tail at (4, 1) falls off\n- From (0, 4), next turn options:\n  - UP to (0, 5): Not in body.

Safe!\n- So I'd have 2 options: UP or RIGHT\n- This moves away from the left edge and toward more open space\n\nBoth options give me 2 follow-up options. Let me think about the longer-term:\n\nIf I go UP:\n- I continue toward apple at (0, 7) which is 4 moves away\n- Path: (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) APPLE!\n- I stay along the left edge, but my body will clear out as I move\n\nIf I go RIGHT:\n- I move into more open space\n- But I'm moving away from the closest apple at (0, 7)\n- The apple at (1, 8) is also nearby\n\nActually, let me think about where the enemy snake might go. Enemy is at (4, 4) with no body (just a head). The apples are at (9, 9), (0, 7), (7, 7), (1, 8), (4, 9). The closest apple to the enemy is probably (7, 7) which is 3 moves right and 3 moves up, or (4, 9) which is 5 moves up.\n\nThe enemy is far from me, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nMy best strategy is to continue toward the apple at (0, 7).

Since I'm already leading 8-0 and need to maintain my lead, continuing to collect apples efficiently is good.\n\nLet me think about potential traps. If I go all the way up to (0, 7), then (1, 7), then (1, 8)... let me trace where my body would be:\n\nCurrent: Head at (0, 4), body at [(0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)]\n\nAfter (0, 5): Body at [(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]\nAfter (0, 6): Body at [(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]\nAfter (0, 7) + apple: Body at [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)] - grows by 1!\nAfter (1, 7): Body at [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]\nAfter (1, 8) + apple: Body at [(1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)] - grows by 1!\n\nWait, at (1, 8), my body would include (1, 2). From (1, 8), where can I go?\n- UP to (1, 9): Safe\n- DOWN to (1, 7): In body! DEADLY\n- LEFT to (0, 8): Safe\n- RIGHT to (2, 8): Safe\n\nOK, I still have 3 safe options from (1, 8). Good.\n\nI'll stick with the plan and go UP.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 30: UP to (0, 5) \u2713 (this turn)\n- Turn 31: UP to (0, 6)\n- Turn 32: UP to (0, 7) - APPLE!

Let me think about positioning...\n\nActually, Path A (UP first) keeps me along the left edge, which is slightly more constrained. Path B (RIGHT first) moves me away from the edge sooner, giving more maneuvering room.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. After I go RIGHT to (1, 7):\n- My body becomes [(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]\n- Tail at (2, 0) falls off\n\nThen from (1, 7), I can go UP to (1, 8) for the apple!\n\nLet me also check enemy movement:\nEnemy at (3, 1) could go:\n- UP to (3, 2)\n- DOWN to (3, 0)\n- LEFT to (2, 1)\n- RIGHT to (4, 1)\n\nThe enemy is far from me and the apples I'm targeting. No immediate concern.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:\n1. It moves me away from the edge\n2. It gives me more maneuvering room\n3. Either path gets me to (1, 8) in 2 turns\n\nActually, let me reconsider UP:\n- Going UP to (0, 8) keeps me closer to the corner\n- But then I can go RIGHT to (1, 8) for the apple\n- From (1, 8) I have good options to continue\n\nBoth are essentially equivalent for getting the apple. I'll go with RIGHT since it moves me away from the constrained left edge first.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 33: RIGHT to (1, 7) \u2713 (this turn)\n- Turn 34: UP to (1, 8) - APPLE!

Let me check: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)]. No! Is it out of bounds? No (y=9 is valid). Safe! No apple there.\n\n2. DOWN: (2, 7) - Is (2, 7) in my body? Let me check: No, it's not in the list. Safe! No apple there.\n\n3. LEFT: (1, 8) - Is (1, 8) in my body? Yes! It's the first segment (right behind my head). DEADLY!\n\n4. RIGHT: (3, 8) - Is (3, 8) in my body? No. Safe! No apple there.\n\nSo I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT is DEADLY (directly behind my head).\n\n**UP to (2, 9):**\n- Safe\n- No apple\n- From (2, 9), next options:\n  - UP: out of bounds (y=10)! DEADLY\n  - DOWN to (2, 8): Would be my old head position - need to consider body movement\n  - LEFT to (1, 9): Safe\n  - RIGHT to (3, 9): Safe\n- This puts me closer to apple at (4, 9) - just 2 more moves right!\n\n**DOWN to (2, 7):**\n- Safe\n- No apple\n- From (2, 7), next options:\n  - UP to (2, 8): Would be my old head position\n  - DOWN to (2, 6): Safe\n  - LEFT to (1, 7): Let me check - (1, 7) is currently in my body. But after I move, my body shifts... but I'm pretty long (10 apples), the body segments are: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)]. After I move, (2, 8) becomes new first body segment, and tail (1, 1) drops off if I didn't eat. So body would be: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. So (1, 7) would still be in body next turn! DEADLY option from (2, 7)!\n  - RIGHT to (3, 7): Safe\n- This moves me closer to apples at (5, 6) and (7, 7)\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 8):**\n- Safe\n- No apple\n- From (3, 8), next options:\n  - UP to (3, 9): Safe\n  - DOWN to (3, 7): Safe\n  - LEFT to (2, 8): Would be my old head position\n  - RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe\n- Good flexibility, moves toward apple at (6, 8) - just 3 more moves right!\n\nLet me think about apple distances:\nFrom (2, 8):\n- (4, 9): 2 right + 1 up = 3 moves\n- (5, 6): 3 right + 2 down = 5 moves\n- (6, 8): 4 right = 4 moves\n- (7, 7): 5 right + 1 down = 6 moves\n- (9, 9): 7 right + 1 up = 8 moves\n\nFrom (2, 9) [UP]:\n- (4, 9): 2 right = 2 moves! Closest!\n- (6, 8): 4 right + 1 down = 5 moves\n\nFrom (2, 7) [DOWN]:\n- (5, 6): 3 right + 1 down = 4 moves\n- (7, 7): 5 right = 5 moves\n\nFrom (3, 8) [RIGHT]:\n- (4, 9): 1 right + 1 up = 2 moves\n- (6, 8): 3 right = 3 moves\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT give similar distance to apples. Let me think strategically:\n\nGoing UP to (2, 9) puts me on row 9, where I can quickly reach (4, 9) in just 2 more RIGHT moves!\n- Turn 36: UP to (2, 9)\n- Turn 37: RIGHT to (3, 9)\n- Turn 38: RIGHT to (4, 9) - APPLE!\n\nGoing RIGHT to (3, 8) also gets me to (4, 9) in 2 more moves:\n- Turn 36: RIGHT to (3, 8)\n- Turn 37: UP to (3, 9)\n- Turn 38: RIGHT to (4, 9) - APPLE!\n\nOR going RIGHT then staying on row 8:\n- Turn 36: RIGHT to (3, 8)\n- Turn 37: RIGHT to (4, 8)\n- Turn 38: RIGHT to (5, 8)\n- Turn 39: RIGHT to (6, 8) - APPLE!\n\nBoth are good options. Let me check what enemy is doing.\n\nEnemy at (1, 0) can go:\n- UP to (1, 1): That's my tail currently! After I move, my body will be [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. So (1, 1) is no longer in my body after I move! Enemy can safely go there.\n- DOWN: out of bounds! DEADLY\n- LEFT to (0, 0): Safe for enemy\n- RIGHT to (2, 0): Safe for enemy\n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. No collision risk with me this turn.\n\nI think going UP is good because:\n1. It gets me to (4, 9) in 2 more moves\n2. After that, I can continue right to (6, 8), (7, 7), etc.\n3. My long body is below me, so I have more room to maneuver on the right side\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. Going UP puts me at the top edge where I can't go UP anymore. Going RIGHT keeps more vertical options open.\n\nBut looking at the board, the apples are mostly in the upper right area:\n- (9, 9) - top right corner\n- (7, 7) - upper right\n- (4, 9) - top middle\n- (6, 8) - upper middle-right\n- (5, 6) - middle\n\nI think I should go UP to (2, 9) and head toward (4, 9), then sweep right collecting apples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Turn 36: UP to (2, 9) \u2713\n- Turn 37: RIGHT to (3, 9)\n- Turn 38: RIGHT to (4, 9) - APPLE!\n- Turn 39: RIGHT to (5, 9)\n- Turn 40: RIGHT to (6, 9)\n- Turn 41: DOWN to (6, 8) - APPLE!\n- Continue collecting...\n\nWith 10 apples and a huge lead (enemy has 0), I'm in great shape. I should keep collecting apples safely.\n\nActually, let me double-check UP to (2, 9) is safe:\n- (2, 9) is not in my body\n- (2, 9) is not out of bounds\n- Enemy head is at (1, 0), far away\n\nYes, UP is safe and good!\n\nWait, let me also check if going RIGHT first is better for flexibility. From (3, 8):\n- I can still reach (4, 9) in 2 moves: UP to (3, 9), RIGHT to (4, 9)\n- I can also go straight to (6, 8) in 3 moves\n\nHmm, both UP and RIGHT are good. I'll go with UP because it's a more direct path to (4, 9), the closest apple.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at my current position:\n\nMy head is at (2, 8), body at [(1, 8), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)].\n\nAnalyzing my four options:\n- UP to (2, 9): Safe - not in body, not out of bounds\n- DOWN to (2, 7): Safe - not in body\n- LEFT to (1, 8): DEADLY - that's my own body (directly behind my head)!\n- RIGHT to (3, 8): Safe - not in body\n\nThree valid moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nApple distances from (2, 8):\n- (4, 9): 2 right + 1 up = 3 moves\n- (5, 6): 3 right + 2 down = 5 moves  \n- (6, 8): 4 right = 4 moves\n- (7, 7): 5 right + 1 down = 6 moves\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 9), I can reach apple at (4, 9) in just 2 more RIGHT moves!\n\nEnemy at (1, 0) is far away - no collision risk. They can go UP to (1, 1) (my old tail spot that's now empty), LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 36: UP to (2, 9) \u2713 (this turn)\n- Turn 37: RIGHT to (3, 9)\n- Turn 38: RIGHT to (4, 9) - APPLE!\n- Then continue right toward (6, 8), (7, 7), and (9, 9)\n\nWith a 10-0 lead, I should keep collecting apples safely while the enemy is far away.\n\nUP",
