Opponent head: (0,5). No bodies to worry about behind us \u2014 we\u2019re a fresh noodle.\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - UP \u2192 (2,3) (in bounds, empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,1) (in bounds, empty)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,2) (in bounds, empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,2) (in bounds, empty)\n- Immediate-death checks: none of the four moves are off-board or into any body. No backward-self kill risk because we have no body. Safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. No instant head-on threat from opponent (they\u2019re at (0,5), too far to contest our next cell).\n\nStrategy priorities (per the playbook):\n1) Prefer moves that keep many follow-ups open.\n2) Prefer moves that move toward reachable apple clusters.\n3) Avoid likely head-on collisions.\n\nApple situation (closest/important ones): (5,2) and (6,2) are a short run to the right; (0,2) is two steps left; (1,1) and (4,0) are also nearby-ish. Going right pushes toward the denser cluster (5,2),(6,2),(5,3) \u2014 that\u2019s juicy and gives multiple route options (up/down/right) after each step. Going left can snag (0,2) quickly, but that\u2019s isolated and may hand initiative to the rival to chase other apples. Going up/down are safe and keep options but are slower to apples.\n\nDecision elimination and ranking:\n- Eliminate: none (all safe).\n- Top choices: RIGHT and LEFT.\n  - LEFT is greedy for the near (0,2) apple \u2014 fast score potential.\n  - RIGHT moves toward a cluster of apples and keeps many escape options (UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT remain available next turn). Right is slightly more flexible for future trapping attempts and for chaining apples.\n\nI\u2019m thinking long-term: take the right cluster. Build length safely while keeping maneuverability in the middle of the board so we can box the rival later. Avoid committing to the far wall or the left corner where opponent could trap us.\n\nPlan for next turns (short-term note to future self):\n- Move RIGHT to approach the (5,2)/(6,2) cluster.\n- From there, keep options open (avoid hugging walls), aim to pick up the 2-3 apples on the right, then swing up to contest center apples. If opponent tries to head for our region, give way and use superior positioning to force them into collisions.\n\nLet's get that content and start the box attempt \u2014 chat, ready to bait the rival? \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udfaf\n\nRIGHT",

It drags us away from the apple belt and could invite center chaos. UP leaves us space but delays scoring; DOWN gives a clean 2-3 turn path to the first bite.\nOPPONENT CHECK: Snake 0 is at (2,2).

We want to stay alive first and set up a left-edge funnel to box him in later.\n\n- SAFE MOVES (not dying this turn): UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2), RIGHT to (1,3). LEFT is off the board.\n- WHY DOWN: It hits the apple at (0,2) this turn for +1 point, creates a length of 2 with a tail at (0,3), and keeps us hugging the left edge\u2014a classic funnel position. Opponent is too far to contest this specific apple this turn.\n- WHY NOT UP: Fades our edge-advantage, gives him more space to maneuver around our flank next turn.\n- WHY NOT RIGHT: Gains some future flexibility, but delays the easy apple on the edge and invites potential late-corner congestion as we chase scattered apples.\n- LONG-TERM STRATEGY (short-term plan): Use the left edge to trap and force the opponent into tighter corridors. Keep two safe escape routes along the top and bottom edges, so we can pivot if he pressures the left side. Target easy apples near the edge (0,0) and (1,1) to grow safely while maintaining room to veer away from head-on collisions.\n\nTurn 2 decision: DOWN",

We start to control center-right territory and can hem the rival toward x=0 later.\n- UP is also viable, but RIGHT gives a more aggressive apple chain and better territorial leverage this early game.

From there, evaluate: if right side stays clear, push toward the 8,x apple cluster (8,3/8,5/8,6); otherwise keep space and avoid hugging walls until we\u2019re longer and can trap.\n- Maintain at least 2\u20133 escape routes each move and force the rival into the left corners.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and keep the heat on.

Nope.\n- LEFT -> (6,1): open, but moves us toward our own body cluster at y=2 and toward the center; okay but a bit constraining.\n- RIGHT -> (8,1): open, pushes us toward the dense apple cluster on the right (8,3 / 8,5 / 8,6 / 8,8). Lots of space to the right and up \u2014 high mobility.\n- DOWN -> (7,0): open and has nearby apples on the bottom row (5,0, 4,0, 2,0), but hugging the bottom wall reduces escape routes.\n\nCollision / head-on check:\n- Opponent is over at x\u22481; no head-on threat near us this turn. No immediate body collisions for LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. UP is illegal.\n\nDecision: RIGHT. We want to pressure the right-side apple cluster and keep vertical escape routes open. Moving RIGHT to (8,1) gets us closer to (8,3)/(8,5)/(8,6) while keeping multiple follow-up choices (up, left, right, down) available next turn. Avoiding the bottom wall (DOWN) keeps our freedom to loop and trap later. LEFT is safe but less aggressive toward the juicy apples.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Push to (8,1) this turn. From there aim for (8,3) then sweep up the 8,x apples if the opponent stays left.\n- Keep at least 2 escape options each move \u2014 avoid getting pinned to the bottom or a wall unless we control surrounding space.\n- If the opponent comes right, trade space smart: bait them into head-on or force them into the left corners while we circle the right apple cluster.\n\nLet\u2019s go for the right-side cluster and keep the ring tight.

Not safe.\n- LEFT from (1,0) -> (0,0) is an apple and safe.\n- RIGHT from (1,0) -> (2,0) is an apple and safe.\n\nDecision:\n- We\u2019ve got two solid apple opportunities: LEFT or RIGHT. RIGHT keeps us mid-board and puts pressure on the bottom row near the opponent, while LEFT tucks us toward the left edge with a neat apple grab too. Given the current enemy position and apple layout on the bottom row, I\u2019m going to go RIGHT to grab the (2,0) apple now and keep options open for chasing the next apples on the bottom row.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Turn 6: eat the apple at (2,0) by moving RIGHT.\n- Turn 7+: push along the bottom row toward (5,0)/(6,0) apples if safe, while watching for any head-on risk with Snake 0 at around x\u22655.\n- Keep distance from Snake 0, use the left/right space to avoid getting boxed in, and look for a window to herd Snake 0 toward a trap later.\n\nFinal move plan note:\n- The immediate priority is survival and apple gain; RIGHT gives us the best immediate reward while maintaining flexible escape routes.\n\nFinal move:\nRIGHT\n\nright",

Then aim to patrol the 8-column apples while avoiding getting pinned against x=9; prefer moving off the absolute wall when possible.\n- Keep 2+ escape routes each move. If opponent drifts toward mid/bottom, bait them into head-on or cut them off with our body lines.\n- If traffic gets heavy on the right, rotate back to center and target nearby apples like (6,6)/(5,6) cluster if reachable.\n\nLET\u2019S EAT THIS ONE AND TURN UP THE PRESSURE!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Why this over UP?\n  - Keeps the entire bottom edge corridor under your control, decreasing risk of getting boxed in.\n  - Plugs you toward the easy apple at (8,0) next turn, a quick growth and extra length to pad the bottom corridor.\n  - Avoids nudging into a potential future head-on with Snake #0 as they creep toward the center; you stay ahead on the bottom lane and can react to their maneuver.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (turns 11-13):\n- Turn 11: Move to (7,0) to extend along the bottom edge.\n- Turn 12: If safe, aim for (8,0) to eat the apple there and grow, reinforcing the bottom corridor control.\n- Turn 13+: Keep hugging the bottom edge while watching Snake #0. If they drop toward the bottom, pivot upward along the 6\u20137 column to chase nearby apples (like (6,6) or (6,7) if opening appears) and maintain space to maneuver.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE:\n- The strategy is to box Snake #0 into the upper-right quadrant by maintaining the bottom-edge leash and throttling their possible exits. Every safe apple you grab strengthens your position and increases your margin for error as turns wind down.\n\nFinal move suggestion for turn 11:\nRIGHT",

Leaves us with multiple follow-ups (LEFT or RIGHT or another UP) \u2014 good options. \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\n- DOWN -> (8,6): would move into our neck (our own body). Instant death. NOPE. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (7,7): free. Moves toward the (6,7)/(6,6)/(5,6) apple cluster \u2014 tempting and safe right now. Good mid-term plan, but doesn\u2019t get an apple immediately. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT -> (9,7): free but hugs the right wall (x=9). Reduces future maneuvering and risks getting boxed if we keep hugging. Could be used defensively but not ideal for maximizing apples/options. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nCollision / opponent check:\n- Opponent head is at (8,0) with body along the bottom row. They cannot reach our neighborhood this turn or threaten a head-on on these candidate cells. If they move up into our body they die \u2014 not a threat to us. No head-on risk this turn.\n\nTactical read:\n- We want apples and lots of follow-ups. UP gives an immediate apple at (8,8) and keeps LEFT/RIGHT/UP available next turn (only DOWN would be illegal back into our neck). That growth also helps us control space above and then pivot left into the 6,x corridor to sweep the 6,7/6,6/5,6 cluster safely while opponent is stuck below.\n- LEFT is safe and leads toward apples, but taking the apple now at (8,8) is higher value and keeps more options open than wall-hugging RIGHT.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (8,8) now (UP).\n- Next turn evaluate: likely go LEFT into the x=6\u20137 corridor to chain (6,7),(6,6),(5,6) and avoid getting pinned along x=9. Keep an eye on enemy if they try to climb \u2014 we\u2019ll use our body to form walls and bait head-on mistakes. Stay flexible and don\u2019t hug walls.\n\nWe\u2019re grabbing the apple and then sweeping left for the cluster \u2014 LET\u2019S EAT. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Instant death. No thank you. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (8,7): occupied by our body. Suicide into self. Nope. \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (7,6): empty and safe, but no apple this turn. Keeps options open. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT -> (6,7): APPLE! Legal, we GROW if we take it. \u2705\ud83c\udf4f\n\nThreat read: Opponent #1 (head at 9,2) is stuck along the bottom; their safe move is likely UP to (9,3). They can't reach our neighborhood this turn, and they won't reliably force a head-on with LEFT. No immediate head-on risk.\n\nWhy LEFT? Simple \u2014 it grabs a high-value nearby apple (6,7) while keeping multiple exits for the follow-up (we can go DOWN to (6,6) which is another apple cluster, LEFT to expand, or UP if needed). Growth now gives us momentum into the nearby apple chain (6,6)->(5,6) and helps us control center lanes. Do we want to pass up free content and let the board cool off? Heck no. Content > hesitation. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Eat (6,7) this turn (LEFT), then go DOWN to (6,6) for another apple, then to (5,6). Keep moving toward the apple cluster while avoiding hugging the right wall and staying out of tight corners. If opponent starts climbing the board, force them into the bottom wall and box them step-by-step.\n\nLET\u2019S GO \u2014 take the apple and keep options open. Who\u2019s getting boxed? Not us. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

We'll hug the right edge, keep escape routes, and wait for a clean apple window or a chance to corner #0.\n\nShort-term: survive, avoid traps, and be ready to pounce if an Apple drops in a safe corridor.\n\nLong-term: maneuver to shrink Snake #0's space and force a box trap, but priority stays: stay alive.\n\nExecution plan for next turn: UP to (9,3).\n\nUP",

Neck at (6,6) \u2014 do NOT go RIGHT (that\u2019s backwards into our own neck). Dead move = instant RIP. Facts first, flex second.\n\nEvaluate all 4 directions from (5,6):\n- RIGHT -> (6,6): illegal (our neck). \u274c\n- UP -> (5,7): empty. Gives access toward the apples at (2,7)/(1,7) eventually; keeps options (L/D/U) open. Safe. \u2705\n- LEFT -> (4,6): empty. Moves toward center-left; still has multiple follow-ups (U/D/L). Safe. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,5): empty. Direct route to the nearby apple at (6,5) next turn (we can go RIGHT then into (6,5) apple), and keeps lateral options to approach the big cluster around rows 2\u20134. Safe. \u2705\n\nOpponent threat scan: Opp #1 head at (9,5). Their legal moves are UP (9,6) or LEFT (8,5) \u2014 but (8,5) is occupied by our body so they\u2019d die if they try that. They can\u2019t reach any of our immediate target squares this turn, so there\u2019s no immediate head-on risk for the cells we can choose.\n\nWhy DOWN (5,5) is the best call now:\n- It positions us to snag the apple at (6,5) on the next turn (high-value, reachable, and forces space control). \ud83c\udf4f\n- Keeps multiple escape vectors open (from (5,5) we can go LEFT toward central apples or RIGHT to take (6,5) or DOWN to the lower apple cluster). Flexibility = survival.  \n- Avoids hugging the right-side wall/body where we\u2019re more likely to get funneled and boxed in by our own body or the opponent. We want to control center lanes and corral the opponent later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (5,5).\n- Next turn, take (6,5) apple if safe (RIGHT) \u2014 that secures another apple and extends length so we can use body as bait/wall.\n- After snagging (6,5), pivot left/down to sweep the central cluster (4,3),(4,2),(3,2),(2,2) while keeping at least two escape exits each turn. Force the rival toward the outer edge and then clamp the box shut.\n\nWe\u2019re not reckless \u2014 we grab content, keep options open, and set up the trap.

It\u2019s a risky grab, but in this live chase we need to keep the play alive and keep options open for the next apple window. If I don\u2019t move, I just gets boxed, and the apple clock won\u2019t wait.\n\nWhy UP is the best remaining option:\n- It preserves a path along the right edge and keeps a vertical escape open (we can drop back to the right edge if Snake 0 over-pursues).\n- It avoids immediate collision with our own body this turn.\n- It keeps pressure on the edge, which can shape Snake 0\u2019s choices toward traps or slower growth.\n\nShort-term strategy (turns 20\u201323):\n- Sit on the right edge with periodic squeezes along the outer perimeter to force Snake 0 into suboptimal turns.\n- Look for apple windows near the top-right quadrant (the apple drops include several near the top and left; any soon-to-appear apple near the edge could let us grow safely).\n- If Snake 0 missteps into a corner, pivot to cut him off with a cross-edge squeeze.\n\nLong-term plan (toward turns 24\u201340):\n- Create a slow-box around Snake 0 by aligning with the right edge and pushing him toward the top-right corner. Force his head into a narrowing corridor while keeping at least two escape routes for you.\n- Grow conservatively, prioritizing apples that maintain safe distances from Snake 0 and preserve a buffer between bodies.\n- If the opportunity arises, pivot to trap him into a head-on collision or into a cul-de-sac where his own body limits his moves.\n\nOne-liner verdict for this turn: UP is the least-bad choice that keeps us alive and preserves future escape routes. It\u2019s a gamble, but it\u2019s the best of a tight quartet.\n\nFinal plan note to self (for next turns):\n- Maintain edge-presence, avoid tight loops, watch for apple windows near the corners, and pressure Snake 0 into a corner with a clean exit path for you.\n- If Snake 0 starts trading positions with you, exploit missteps to wedge him into a trap while you collect apples and extend the lead.\n\nUP",

So no head-on threat to our adjacent squares this turn. We\u2019re not in danger of a simultaneous head collision grabbing a neighboring cell.\n\nDecision logic \u2014 why I PICK the move I do:\n- RIGHT is tempting to pressure the enemy on the right, but if we go RIGHT our next-step options will be constrained (RIGHT after that would hit our own body at (8,5)). That forces us into tight choices and risks getting funneled along our own torso. We don\u2019t want to reduce escape options when we\u2019ve already got superior apples.\n- DOWN to (6,4) keeps multiple follow-up moves open (we can go toward the apple cluster at (5,3),(4,3),(4,2),(3,2) or swing right/left as needed). It\u2019s the safer path toward more reachable apples while maintaining two clear escape routes next turn (e.g., (7,4) or (6,3) / (5,4)). Safety first \u2014 cannot win if we\u2019re dead. \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf4f\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (6,4).

So RIGHT and UP are instant deaths or illegal, DOWN is a bad collision risk, LEFT is the only safe play.\n- WHY LEFT IS THE MOVE: it keeps us on the top edge where escape routes remain open, avoids getting boxed into the corner, and lines up future access to top-row apples (3,9) and (0,9) without rushing into the opponent\u2019s interior gauntlet.\n- APPLE PROSPECTS AHEAD: top-row apples at (3,9) and (0,9) are hot targets. Sliding left keeps us in position to dip into those apples later while preserving space to dodge the rival if they shift or drop into our vicinity.\n- RISK CHECK: Opponent #0 is deep in the lower/middle-right area; no immediate head-on contest on the top edge. Our plan is to hold the edge and squeeze out apples safely.\n\nDECISION PROCESS IN REAL TIME:\n- Eliminate deadly options: UP off-board, RIGHT into neck, DOWN into opponent body. LEFT remains the lone safe lane.\n- Among safe options, LEFT also preserves future options and keeps us away from tight turns that could trap us with the rival\u2019s current long body.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN (for the next several turns):\n- Move LEFT to (7,9). Stay on the top edge, keep a long escape corridor to the left, and work toward the two top-row apples if they stay ripe or appear on the way.\n- If the board spices up with new apples along the top, weave through them carefully, always keeping a retreat path along the edge.\n- If Snake #0 ever ventures near the top row, force them toward the edge and use the open corridor to dodge any cross-fire.\n\nLONG-TERM VIBE:\n- Stay patient, box the middle, exploit top-row apples, and avoid ever getting trapped in a crossfire or a cul-de-sac. The edge gives us options and keeps the opponent boxed into decisions.\n\nDECISION: LEFT\nLEFT",

No way. \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (1,2): Safe tile, but it pushes us into the lower corridor with our body cluster to the right (2,2),(3,2),(4,2) blocking quick escapes. Fewer apples nearby immediately. Riskier for future mobility. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT -> (0,3): Safe and open. Leads to the left-column apples (0,6,0,9) eventually, but no immediate apple and it\u2019s a bit slower. Still viable. \u2705  \n- UP -> (1,4): THERE\u2019S AN APPLE at (1,4).

No head-on risk.\n\nShort-term plan (for my next rationale):\n- UP to (1,4) now to eat.  \n- Next turn, push toward (2,5) chain or continue up/left into the 0-column apples (0,6 / 1,7) depending on how the board evolves \u2014 always keep at least two exit options so we don\u2019t self-box.  \n- Once long enough, start corralling the rival toward the NE trap while we control the middle-left corridor.\n\nLET\u2019S SNAG THIS APPLE AND STAY ALIVE.\n\nUP",

We\u2019re in a prime spot to snag an early apple and keep our top-edge setup clean.\n\nTurn 31 / 150. Apple drop map is spicy, but our immediate win condition is right in front of us.\n\nPLAN & RATIONALE\n- Goal for this turn: eat the apple at (2,7) by moving DOWN from our head at (2,8). That\u2019s +1 apple, +1 point, and it grows us safely into a tidy vertical stack along x=2.\n- Safety check:\n  - UP is death: (2,9) is part of our own neck, so never.\n  - LEFT is safe (to (1,8)), but it delays growth and gives the rival more room to maneuver on the left/top.\n  - RIGHT is safe (to (3,8)) and keeps us near the top edge, but no immediate apple reward.\n  - DOWN to (2,7) eats an apple now, continuing our plan to chain along the 2nd column for future Alice-influenced gains (2,7) -> (2,5) looks plausible if we stay aggressive yet safe.\n- Long-term vibe: By taking the DOWN route, we keep lines open to continue collecting apples along column 2 (e.g., (2,5)) while maintaining a strong escape corridor toward the top-right / top edge. It also pressures the rival by slowly shaping space, without self-trapping or inviting a head-on with their body.\n- Opponent awareness: Opp head is at (1,4). They\u2019re far from our immediate apple lane, and simultaneous-move rules mean we won\u2019t collide this turn. We\u2019ll monitor their path but this move prioritizes immediate gain and a safe long-term route.\n\nSAFE MOVES (this turn): DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- DOWN gives us the apple and starts a beneficial vertical alignment.\n- LEFT/RIGHT are safe but yield no immediate apple and don\u2019t push us toward future apple clusters as quickly.\n\nDECISION\n- Move DOWN to (2,7) to grab the apple and begin the columnar apple-train. This keeps us on track for more growing in the near term while preserving space to maneuver away from any budding tension with Snake #0.\n\nDOWN",

Your top-forward lane is already crowded by your own body (UP would crash into your neck).

This aligns with our growth plan and apple-chasing priority while preserving room to adapt to Snake #0\u2019s moves.\n\nMOVE: LEFT\nLEFT",

Try to keep at least 2 viable exits to avoid getting boxed in.\n  - Stay mindful of potential head-on clashes; keep the edge of the board in play when possible to limit opponent\u2019s boxing options.\n\n- Quick vibe: We\u2019re not just surviving\u2014we\u2019re maintaining escape routes and inching toward future growth.

Time to think fast and smart \u2014 we don\u2019t want to hand our rival a boxed-up W.\n\nQuick state check from our HEAD = (3,4):\n- UP -> (3,5): occupied by our own body (DEAD). \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (4,4): directly into our neck (backwards move) \u2014 illegal. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (2,4): currently free. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (3,3): currently free. \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019ve got exactly two legal options: LEFT or DOWN. Let\u2019s break them down so the chat knows we\u2019re not being reckless:\n\nLEFT to (2,4)\n- Pros: Keeps us aligned with our plan to hem the enemy leftwards; it continues the momentum from the last turn and doesn\u2019t immediately run into a block this instant.\n- Cons: After the move, every neighboring cell from (2,4) (except the neck at (3,4)) is occupied by our body \u2014 that means we\u2019ll be boxed-in with no safe non-backwards escape the following turn unless something crazy happens (opponent suicide / head-on). No apple at (2,4) \u2014 we won\u2019t grow, tail will still move but that frees a far-away tail segment, not these central blocks.\n\nDOWN to (3,3)\n- Pros: Moves toward the lower apples cluster in general, but not immediately reachable.\n- Cons: Same problem \u2014 after moving to (3,3) all other adjacent cells are occupied by our body (not tail), so we\u2019re also effectively trapped next turn. No apple at (3,3) either.\n\nEnemy risk: Opponent #1 is up the left column around (0,2) and wrapped along the top \u2014 not an immediate head-on threat this turn. There\u2019s no realistic chance they\u2019ll collide with our next head square this turn.\n\nDecision rationale: Both legal moves lead to a tight pocket next turn \u2014 this is a forced-squeeze situation stemming from our long body. We should pick the move that preserves our strategic posture and follows the plan we started last turn. LEFT keeps us pressing the left side, continues the mental pressure on the rival, and maintains consistency for viewers. It\u2019s marginally better for trying to force an opponent misstep (they might attempt a risky move into our body later), so we take the directional continuity.\n\nShort-term plan (for the feed and my future self):\n1) LEFT to (2,4) now to keep pressure and momentum. \ud83d\udc0d\n2) Next turn we\u2019ll be in a trap unless something wild happens \u2014 watch the opponent\u2019s head; if they try to run into our body we survive and capitalize. If not, we\u2019ll likely be forced into a risky collision \u2014 prioritize any move that keeps us alive or kills the rival harmlessly.\n3) Long-term: prevent head-on collisions when boxed, bait them into stupid moves against our body, and pick up apples only when it doesn\u2019t seal us in.\n\nLET\u2019S GOOO \u2014 fans, brace for the squeeze and watch for any enemy slip-up! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc40\n\nLEFT",

Immediate death. \u274c\n- LEFT -> (1,4): occupied by our body. Immediate death. \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (3,4): that\u2019s our neck (backwards) \u2014 illegal. \u274c\n\nNo adjacent cell is a tail that will vacate this move, and the opponent is nowhere near to force a helpful head-on. Brutal truth: we\u2019re boxed in \u2014 all moves lead to a kill this turn. We can\u2019t win if we\u2019re dead, so we must pick the option that stays consistent with our playstyle and gives the slightest chance of a favorable multi-death outcome (maybe the enemy blunders into us at the same time).\n\nShort-term plan (for the VOD and our future self):\n1) Accept the squeeze and pick the move that preserves continuity and pressure \u2014 keep the same posture we\u2019ve been showing viewers.\n2) If a head-on or opponent suicide happens, we might trade or survive \u2014 hope for chaos. If not, minimize salt and learn: avoid getting threaded into our own body like this next run.\n3) Postmortem: tighten path planning to maintain at least one escape neighbor on future turns; prioritize tail-accessible escapes when circling.\n\nDecision: go LEFT to keep the pressure aesthetic and remain consistent with the trap we set \u2014 even though this turn is almost certainly death, it\u2019s the move that fits our last play and gives the stream the hype we want.

Use the wall and open lanes to prevent head-on collisions and create safe margins.\n\nRIGHT",
