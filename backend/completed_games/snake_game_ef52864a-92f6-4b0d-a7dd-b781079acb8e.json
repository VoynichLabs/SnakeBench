Meanwhile, moving UP to (6,1) would increase our distance to the apple at (0,0) slightly (from 6 to 7) and to the apple at (5,2) it would also yield a distance of 2; however, LEFT seems to be the more direct approach toward both apple targets.\n\nIn addition, moving LEFT keeps us away from our own body, and currently there is no enemy snake threatening the left side.

However, based on our previous analysis our board indicated an opportunity \u201cdirectly above our head\u201d that we identified as containing an apple. Here\u2019s the reasoning: from our head at (3,7), moving UP (to (3,8)) does not run into any obstacles, and it appears that clear space ahead would be most favorable for a safe move.\n\n\u2022 Our board shows no enemy snake directly above. Our snake body and enemy snake positions are all safely away from that target.\n\n\u2022 While our previous justification mentioned an apple at (3,7), examining the apple list we see that the nearest apple in the upward region is actually on the left or right side of the board. Still, our present move must ensure we do not risk crashing into walls or our own tail.\n\n\u2022 Given that moving UP from (3,7) takes us to (3,8) \u2013 a cell that appears to be free \u2013 this path looks safe. It also helps keep us relatively central so that we can later navigate towards one of the apples ((8,9), (9,8), or (7,7)).\n\nThus, proceeding UP is both safe and leaves good prospects for future turns.\n\nDecided next move: UP."
