Safe and beneficial (I will grow and gain a point immediately).\n- DOWN: Move back to (7,7). That's occupied by my own body segment, instant danger. Invalid move.\n- LEFT: Move to (6,8), open space but misses immediate apple opportunity.\n- RIGHT: Move to (8,8), open space, but misses immediate apple opportunity.\n\n3. Optimal Move:\n- Clearly, moving UP is the best choice here, as I will instantly grab the apple at (7,9), scoring another point and growing the snake further.

This movement is fatal and unsafe.\n\n   Good: we have three valid safe moves this turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n4. **Strategize based on nearest apple**:  \n   Closest apple from current position (5, 8) is at (6, 4), just below and slightly to the right.  \n   Let's see quickly if any immediate moves can guide us effectively toward it:  \n   - DOWN (5,7) directly moves me closer vertically towards the apple at (6,4)\u2014a logical first choice to approach the apple swiftly.  \n   - UP (5,9) moves me further away from the apple's vertical position\u2014not favorable.  \n   - LEFT (4,8) doesn't move me closer and doesn't have immediate advantage in approaching apples this turn.\n\n   Thus, going DOWN would clearly be optimal, bringing me closer to the valuable apple at (6,4).\n\n5. **Check for any immediate next-turn threats if choosing DOWN**:  \n   Next turn from (5,7), quickly check potential hazards:  \n   - DOWN again (5,6) currently occupied by enemy snake (#2)'s body segments.  \n   - RIGHT (6,7) is also currently occupied by enemy snake's body.  \n   So if picking DOWN, I'll have fewer options next turn; however, LEFT (4,7) after moving DOWN to (5,7) is open and still available next turn, ensuring at least one safe move afterward.\n\n   Still, even with fewer next-turn options, DOWN this turn remains clearly beneficial to approach the apple.\n\n6. **Watch out next turn carefully:**  \n   Next moves, stay aware of enemy Snake #2 movements. If Snake #2 moves unpredictably, cautiously rethink path carefully.\n\n**Conclusion and strategy going forward:**  \nMoving DOWN is both safe and brings me closer efficiently toward the apple at (6,4). On next turn, be prepared to potentially move LEFT if DOWN again becomes blocked by enemy snake.\n\nMy Next Move: DOWN"

          "rationale": "Thinking out loud step-by-step clearly again, updating the information after my last decided move (DOWN):\n\nStep 1: **Update my Current Position and Body Structure**:\nMy previous head position was at (5,7).  \nSince I decided to move DOWN to (5,6), my new head position is now (5,6).  \nMy body now occupies:  \n[(5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8)]  \nLet's double-check carefully for safety:\n\nIMPORTANT immediate safety check:  \n- Wait: position (5,6) was previously occupied by Snake #2's body segment. Let's carefully confirm snake #2's movement last turn before concluding safety.\n\nStep 2: **Carefully check Enemy Snake #2 movements**:  \nPreviously Snake #2 had head at (4,5) and body at [(5,5),(5,6)].  \nLast move, I clearly saw snake #2's body at (5,6) \u2014 if Snake #2 did not move away from (5,6), the spot is unsafe. snakes move every turn, too. Snake #2 could have moved one square.\n\nPossible Snake #2 movements from its last known location at (4,5):  \n- UP would move Snake #2 to (4,6), a safe possibility.  \n- DOWN moves to (4,4), safe as well.  \n- LEFT moves to (3,5), which is an apple and a good possibility.  \n- RIGHT moves to (5,5), occupied previously by Snake #2's body, unsafe (collision with itself), thus impossible.\n\nThus, Snake #2 either moved UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), or LEFT (3,5).\n\nSince (5,6) would have been vacated (as snakes move forward each turn), snake #2's tail indeed moved forward too. Thus, (5,6) should NOW BE OPEN after snakes updated movements. Thus, my new position (5,6) is safe.\n\nStep 3: **Quick Refresh: Apples Remaining and Relevant**:\nApples: (0,6), (3,5), (3,3), (2,0), (6,4)  \nClosest apple from my current position (5,6) is clearly the apple at (6,4). It is just TWO squares away, below and right.\n\nStep 4: **Assess Immediate Available Moves from (5,6)**:  \nChecking surroundings swiftly:  \n- UP: (5,7)\u2014 recently occupied by my own body currently, unsafe this turn.  \n- DOWN: (5,5)\u2014 previously snake #2 was there, but since snake #2 was at (4,5) last turn, its body segment at (5,5) likely moved or disappeared forward. However, let's verify carefully: Snake #2 could have moved to (3,5) (left apple), DOWN or UP, freeing this square. But we can't yet be sure\u2014so hold this as uncertain temporarily.  \n- LEFT: (4,6)\u2014 previously empty; no previous snakes or apples here. Should still be clear and is a guaranteed safe square. Good fallback safety option.  \n- RIGHT: (6,6)\u2014 previously empty. Square likely remains safe and available. Good option moving closer horizontally toward apple target at (6,4).\n\nThus, right now LEFT (4,6) and RIGHT (6,6) are clearly safe options. DOWN (5,5) is uncertain but questionable. UP (5,7) blocked by my body segment, unsafe.\n\nStep 5: **Evaluate Best Move toward the apple at (6,4)**:  \nClearly, RIGHT (to 6,6) moves directly horizontally closer toward the apple at (6,4) and preserves immediate proximity, leaving next move DOWN (6,5) open clearly toward apple next turn. Also, RIGHT (6,6) clearly is safe with no immediate threats.\n\nDouble-checking this route carefully again:\n- Move right to (6,6): safe, open square.\n- Next turn DOWN (6,5): square previously empty and safe, also moves directly next to and above apple at (6,4).\n- The following turn, direct DOWN (6,4) finds the apple successfully without any clear immediate obstacle.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT this turn is safe and strategic, clearly positioning myself carefully towards consuming the apple smoothly on the next two turns.\n\nStep 6: **Considerations for future turns**:  \nBe cautious of snake #2's movements carefully. Next turn, quickly reconfirm opponent snake positions again before committing to DOWN (6,5). If needed, LEFT (5,6) might then be clear safety options again next turns.\n\nNext-turn strategy reminder:  \n- Carefully verify snake positioning and recheck immediate spots next turn when closer to apple.  \n- If DOWN toward apple is risky next turn, LEFT or alternative safe move is your fallback during the next step.\n\n**Conclusion of current reasoning clearly summarized:**  \nRIGHT is currently the clearest and safest smart move toward nearest reachable apple at (6,4). It positions my snake comfortably for a clear approach to the apple next turns. It does not create immediate danger or future dead-ends.\n\nMy Next Move: RIGHT"

This square was previously safe after being occupied by myself two turns ago. Let's confirm clearly: currently my body position includes [(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(6,9),(7,9)]. Square (6,7) not occupied by my body at this moment, making it now safe and open.\n- DOWN: (6,5)\u2014 previously empty, it's directly toward apple at (6,4).

Clearly safe.\n\n## Step 5: Optimal Move Clearly Explained \u2014 Continue Towards Closest Apple (6,4)\n\nClearly, the most beneficial action remains moving towards apple at (6,4), directly DOWN onto square (6,5):\n\n- This brings our snake just one square from the apple at (6,4), perfectly setting up for consumption clearly next turn.\n- The target white apple is clearly free and safe at the moment.\n\nLet's briefly verify future turn safety for approaching square (6,4):\n- Apple at (6,4): already confirmed safe and accessible; no snake occupies that yet.\n- After the next DOWN move (to 6,5), clearly next immediate move can again be DOWN to (6,4), completing clear consumption of the apple.\n\nThus, this clear strategic and immediate safe sequence still holds true.\n\n## Step 6: Final Safety Double Check and Explicit Next Move\n\nNext square DOWN (6,5) clearly safe:\n- Not occupied by self (checked)\n- Not occupied by any snake (checked)\n- Not outside board (checked)\n\nAll careful checks clearly reinforce this as clearly optimal move.\n\n## Strategy Reminder for Next Turns Clearly\n\nNext turn, confirm again carefully:\n- If (6,4) clearly remains free of enemy, simply move DOWN immediately to consume apple.\n- Always stay aware carefully of snake #2 positions again before clearly moving next turn to avoid late surprises.\n\n## Clearly Decided Move (careful and safe): DOWN"

The move was clearly safe, as previously confirmed.\n\nThus, now our updated snake's positions become:\n\n- **Head:** (5,5) (just occupied in last move)\n- **Body:** [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8)]\n\n## Step 2: Check Apple Positions (unchanged, as we have not eaten one yet):\n\nApples' positions remain at: \n- (0,6), (3,5), (2,0), (7,1), (1,7)\n\nApple at (3,5) clearly remains the closest strategic target to consider first:\n- Our current position is now at head: (5,5)\n- The apple at (3,5) is positioned clearly left, on our same y level, thus an optimal and straightforward path exists by moving LEFT twice (5,5) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (3,5).\n\n## Step 3: Clear and Careful Safety Check of Moves from Current Head Position (5,5):\n\n- **UP (5,6)**: occupied clearly by our own body at position (6,6), unsafe.\n- **DOWN (5,4)**: occupied by our own body segment, clearly unsafe at position (5,4).\n- **LEFT (4,5)**: clear and clearly safe, open path.\n- **RIGHT (6,5)**: occupied clearly by our own body, unsafe.\n\nFrom the current detailed inspection, the clear and only safe option now is LEFT (4,5).\n\nConveniently, LEFT is precisely towards our main apple target at (3,5)!\n\n## Step 4: Strategic considerations (Enemy Snake):\n\n- Enemy snake #2 is still positioned far away at (3,0), body at [(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)] and poses minimal threat from this distance and position. We must only consider carefully later its position if we continue to move downward or leftward beyond the apple.\n\nCurrently, clearly no immediate threat.\n\n## Step 5: Clearly decide best strategic move now:\n\nThe strategic goal has always remained clear: take apples safely to score points. Right now, CLEARLY the very next step (LEFT to (4,5)) is safe and directly aligned towards our primary apple target at (3,5).\n\nThus, the clearly optimal, careful, and strategic next move is clearly LEFT.\n\n## Strategy note for next turn clearly to remember:\n\n- Next turn, carefully reassess clearly again. Apple at (3,5) likely attainable in next move, but carefully watch our body and enemy positions again next time.\n\n\u2705 **Decided Move: LEFT**"
