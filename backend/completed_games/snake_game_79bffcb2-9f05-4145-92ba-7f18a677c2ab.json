          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's get this bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're at Turn 0 and we're ready to dominate. Let's assess the battlefield. We're at (7, 9) with an empty body. The enemy is at (7, 6). Apples are scattered everywhere, but we're hunting the snake, not the food.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Eliminate Bad Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 10) is off the board. Dead. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 9) contains an apple 'A'. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 9) is empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Analyze Safe Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):** This keeps us somewhat central, but look at the board map! (7, 8) is directly above the enemy snake at (7, 6). We'd be setting up a vertical confrontation. If the enemy moves UP next turn, we crash. If we move DOWN next turn, we crash. It's a risk, but we want to pressure him.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):** This eats an apple immediately! We start our growth. (6, 9) is safe. If we go LEFT, we can potentially drop down the left side of the board later to cut off the enemy's escape routes.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** This moves us away from the enemy. Safe, but passive. We don't want to play passive when we're on the same x-coordinate.\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   We are at (7, 9). Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   If we go DOWN to (7, 8), we are moving closer to the enemy, maintaining the same x-coordinate. This is the **aggressive** play. It forces the enemy to react. If he keeps going UP, we can bait him or turn on him.\n    *   If we go LEFT to (6, 9), we eat an apple (growth is good for dominating space), but we shift our x-axis. The enemy might use that space to move UP or LEFT.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Logic:** If we go DOWN and he goes UP, we tie and both die. If we have a higher score later, this is good. Currently, we are tied 0-0. A tie is a draw, but we want the win.\n    *   However, looking at the board, (7, 8) is empty. (7, 7) is empty. (7, 6) is the enemy.\n    *   If we go DOWN now, we occupy (7, 8).\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   The apple at (7, 8) is NOT there (apple is at 6,9, 8,9). (7, 8) is empty.\n    *   Let's look at the apples. There is an apple at (6, 9). If we go LEFT, we eat. If we go DOWN, we don't eat.\n    *   **Wait, looking at the board state again:**\n        Row 9: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        We are at index 7.\n        Index 6 is 'A'.\n        Index 8 is '.'.\n        If we go LEFT (Index 6), we eat the apple. This gives us +1 size and +1 score immediately. This is crucial for the long game.\n        If we go DOWN, we go to (7, 8). That is safe, but we don't eat.\n\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go DOWN, I'm chasing the snake vertically. If I go LEFT, I secure food and can then look to move DOWN on the next turn from a slightly offset position (6, 8 or 6, 9).\n    *   Let's check safety of LEFT: (6, 9). Is it empty? Yes, it's an apple. Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is there any immediate threat? No. Enemy is 3 units away.\n    *   Is there a risk of being boxed in? No.\n    *   **Aggression vs. Growth:** We want to dominate. An early apple helps us grow larger, giving us more board presence and a score lead. While moving DOWN puts us on a collision course immediately, moving LEFT secures resources *and* keeps us alive.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the Aggression:** The enemy is at (7,6). If I go DOWN to (7,8), we are 2 squares apart vertically.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9), I am diagonal-ish to him.\n    *   Let's look at the board layout. There is a gap. The enemy has no body.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am on the same column. This is the \"Mexican Standoff\" setup. If he goes UP, I die or tie (if we both move into same cell).\n    *   Actually, wait. If I am at (7, 9) and move DOWN to (7, 8). He is at (7, 6).\n    *   If he moves UP to (7, 7). We are at (7, 8) and (7, 7). No collision yet.\n    *   Next turn: I could move DOWN to (7, 7). He could move UP to (7, 8). We swap or crash.\n    *   This is a classic Snake \"chicken\" game.\n    *   However, there is an apple at (6, 9).\n    *   If I take the apple, I grow. I become stronger. I move my head to (6, 9).\n    *   From (6, 9), I can look to drop down to (6, 8) or (6, 7) to intercept the enemy who is at column 7.\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 6). They are deep in the center.\n    *   If I eat the apple at (6, 9), I am at the top edge.\n    *   Is there a better move?\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe. No apple. Puts pressure on enemy.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe. Eats apple. +1 Score.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Safe. No apple. Moves away from enemy.\n    *   **Decision:** Taking the apple is concrete value. It allows me to grow. The enemy is moving around. I should secure the resource and then maneuver.\n    *   However, the prompt says \"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   I don't have a higher score yet. I need the score first.\n    *   **LEFT** is the move that grabs food.\n    *   Let's double check the coordinates. (6, 9) is an apple 'A'.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am at (6, 9).\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   Next turn, I can go DOWN to (6, 8) or (6, 7) to chase.\n    *   Actually, looking at the board, there is an apple at (6, 5)? No, that's (5, 2).\n    *   Let's look at the apples again.\n    *   (6, 9) is an apple. (8, 9) is an apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I eat (6, 9).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I eat (8, 9)? No, (8, 9) is empty? Board 9: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n    *   Index 8 is `.` (empty). Index 9 is `A`.\n    *   So (8, 9) is empty. (9, 9) is an apple.\n    *   (9, 9) is an apple. (9, 0) is an apple.\n    *   (6, 9) is an apple.\n    *   Okay, so only (6, 9) is adjacent and edible.\n    *   Let's go LEFT to eat.\n\n    *   **Wait, aggression check:**\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7, 8).\n    *   Enemy moves. Where can he go?\n        *   UP to (7, 7).\n        *   DOWN to (7, 5).\n        *   LEFT to (6, 6).\n        *   RIGHT to (8, 6).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am at (7, 8).\n    *   If he goes UP to (7, 7), we are 1 square apart.\n    *   If he goes UP again next turn, we crash (if I go down).\n    *   This is a pure aggression play.\n    *   But I have no score.\n    *   The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   Implication: If score is tied or lower, avoid suicide crash.\n    *   Therefore, getting the score first is better.\n    *   **LEFT** it is.\n\n    *   **Plan for next turn:**\n    *   Move LEFT to (6, 9) to eat the apple.\n    *   Next turn, look to move DOWN to (6, 8) to approach the enemy while keeping column 6 blocked.\n    *   Or, if the enemy moves aggressively, I can pivot.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n    *   Move LEFT: (6, 9). Is it safe?\n        *   Off board? No.\n        *   Own body? No.\n        *   Enemy body? No (Enemy is at 7,6).\n        *   Enemy head moving into me? Unlikely, he's far.\n    *   This is the best move for growth and positioning.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look at (7, 8) again.**\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am setting up a wall.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am moving out of the direct vertical line of fire.\n    *   Let's see the board state.\n    *   `9 . . . . . . A 0 . A`\n    *   `8 . . . . . . A . A .`\n    *   `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    *   `6 . . . . . . . 1 A .`\n    *   `5 . . . A . . A . . A`\n    *   `4 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    *   `3 . .

A`\n\n    *   Enemy (1) is at (7,6).\n    *   I am at (7,9).\n    *   Apple at (6,9).\n    *   Apple at (8,9).\n    *   Apple at (9,9).\n    *   Apple at (9,3).\n    *   Apple at (8,6) - wait, look at row 6: `. . . . . . . 1 A .`\n    *   (8,6) is an apple! (9,6) is empty.\n    *   The enemy is at (7,6). There is an apple at (8,6).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8), the enemy might go RIGHT to (8,6) to eat that apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9), I eat an apple.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am close to the enemy.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am securing a point.\n    *   Let's look at the \"Archrival\" aspect. I want to box him in.\n    *   To box him in, I need to control the space around him.\n    *   He is at column 7. I am at column 7.\n    *   If I move LEFT to column 6, I can control column 6.\n    *   If I stay at column 7 (DOWN), I am challenging column 7 directly.\n    *   Direct challenge at turn 0 with 0 score vs 0 score is risky.\n    *   Securing the apple at (6, 9) gives me the lead.\n    *   Then, with the lead, I can force collisions.\n    *   **So, LEFT is the move.**\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a trap?**\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9).\n    *   Next turn, if I go DOWN to (6,8).\n    *   The enemy is at (7,6).\n    *   I can then go DOWN to (6,7).\n    *   I can cut him off from the left side.\n    *   He is currently in a relatively open space, but the left side is open too.\n    *   Actually, looking at column 6:\n    *   Row 9: A (Target)\n    *   Row 8: A\n    *   Row 7: .\n    *   Row 6: . (Enemy is at 7,6)\n    *   Row 5: .\n    *   If I take (6,9) and (6,8), I own column 6.\n    *   If I own column 6, I can push him to the right wall (columns 8, 9).\n    *   The right wall has apples at (8,6), (9,5), (9,3), (9,9), (9,0).\n    *   If I push him there, he has to eat apples to grow, but he'll eventually hit the wall or me.\n    *   This is a good plan.\n    *   So, **LEFT** to start the flank.\n\n    *   **Wait, one last check on DOWN.**\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8).\n    *   Enemy might go UP to (7,7).\n    *   Then I go DOWN to (7,7) (suicide/crash) or LEFT to (6,8).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8) and Enemy goes UP to (7,7), I am at (7,8) and he is at (7,7).\n    *   Next turn I can go LEFT to (6,8).\n    *   Then I am at (6,8) and he is at (7,7).\n    *   I can go DOWN to (6,7). He can go UP to (7,6).\n    *   I can go LEFT to (5,7). He can go UP to (7,5).\n    *   This is also a valid chase.\n    *   But with DOWN, I risk a head-on collision immediately on turn 1 or 2 if he decides to be aggressive.\n    *   With LEFT, I gain a resource first.\n    *   Usually, in these simulations, securing the first point is valuable for the \"win condition\" logic (score > score).\n    *   I will go LEFT.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Eat the apple at (6,9) to gain a point lead.

Let's get this bread! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 We're at Turn 0 and we're ready to dominate. Let's assess the battlefield. We're at (7, 9) with an empty body. The enemy is at (7, 6). Apples are scattered everywhere, but we're hunting the snake, not the food.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1.  **Eliminate Bad Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** (7, 10) is off the board. Dead. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 9) contains an apple 'A'. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8, 9) is empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **Analyze Safe Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):** This keeps us somewhat central, but look at the board map! (7, 8) is directly above the enemy snake at (7, 6). We'd be setting up a vertical confrontation. If the enemy moves UP next turn, we crash. If we move DOWN next turn, we crash. It's a risk, but we want to pressure him.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):** This eats an apple immediately! We start our growth. (6, 9) is safe. If we go LEFT, we can potentially drop down the left side of the board later to cut off the enemy's escape routes.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** This moves us away from the enemy. Safe, but passive. We don't want to play passive when we're on the same x-coordinate.\n\n3.  **Strategy & Aggression:**\n    *   We are at (7, 9). Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   If we go DOWN to (7, 8), we are moving closer to the enemy, maintaining the same x-coordinate. This is the **aggressive** play. It forces the enemy to react. If he keeps going UP, we can bait him or turn on him.\n    *   If we go LEFT to (6, 9), we eat an apple (growth is good for dominating space), but we shift our x-axis. The enemy might use that space to move UP or LEFT.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Logic:** If we go DOWN and he goes UP, we tie and both die. If we have a higher score later, this is good. Currently, we are tied 0-0. A tie is a draw, but we want the win.\n    *   However, looking at the board, (7, 8) is empty. (7, 7) is empty. (7, 6) is the enemy.\n    *   If we go DOWN now, we occupy (7, 8).\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   The apple at (7, 8) is NOT there (apple is at 6,9, 8,9). (7, 8) is empty.\n    *   Let's look at the apples. There is an apple at (6, 9). If we go LEFT, we eat. If we go DOWN, we don't eat.\n    *   **Wait, looking at the board state again:**\n        Row 9: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        We are at index 7.\n        Index 6 is 'A'.\n        Index 8 is '.'.\n        If we go LEFT (Index 6), we eat the apple. This gives us +1 size and +1 score immediately. This is crucial for the long game.\n        If we go DOWN, we go to (7, 8). That is safe, but we don't eat.\n\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go DOWN, I'm chasing the snake vertically. If I go LEFT, I secure food and can then look to move DOWN on the next turn from a slightly offset position (6, 8 or 6, 9).\n    *   Let's check safety of LEFT: (6, 9). Is it empty? Yes, it's an apple. Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is there any immediate threat? No. Enemy is 3 units away.\n    *   Is there a risk of being boxed in? No.\n    *   **Aggression vs. Growth:** We want to dominate. An early apple helps us grow larger, giving us more board presence and a score lead. While moving DOWN puts us on a collision course immediately, moving LEFT secures resources *and* keeps us alive.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the Aggression:** The enemy is at (7,6). If I go DOWN to (7,8), we are 2 squares apart vertically.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9), I am diagonal-ish to him.\n    *   Let's look at the board layout. There is a gap. The enemy has no body.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am on the same column. This is the \"Mexican Standoff\" setup. If he goes UP, I die or tie (if we both move into same cell).\n    *   Actually, wait. If I am at (7, 9) and move DOWN to (7, 8). He is at (7, 6).\n    *   If he moves UP to (7, 7). We are at (7, 8) and (7, 7). No collision yet.\n    *   Next turn: I could move DOWN to (7, 7). He could move UP to (7, 8). We swap or crash.\n    *   This is a classic Snake \"chicken\" game.\n    *   However, there is an apple at (6, 9).\n    *   If I take the apple, I grow. I become stronger. I move my head to (6, 9).\n    *   From (6, 9), I can look to drop down to (6, 8) or (6, 7) to intercept the enemy who is at column 7.\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 6). They are deep in the center.\n    *   If I eat the apple at (6, 9), I am at the top edge.\n    *   Is there a better move?\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe. No apple. Puts pressure on enemy.\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe. Eats apple. +1 Score.\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Safe. No apple. Moves away from enemy.\n    *   **Decision:** Taking the apple is concrete value. It allows me to grow. The enemy is moving around. I should secure the resource and then maneuver.\n    *   However, the prompt says \"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   I don't have a higher score yet. I need the score first.\n    *   **LEFT** is the move that grabs food.\n    *   Let's double check the coordinates. (6, 9) is an apple 'A'.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am at (6, 9).\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   Next turn, I can go DOWN to (6, 8) or (6, 7) to chase.\n    *   Actually, looking at the board, there is an apple at (6, 5)? No, that's (5, 2).\n    *   Let's look at the apples again.\n    *   (6, 9) is an apple. (8, 9) is an apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I eat (6, 9).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I eat (8, 9)? No, (8, 9) is empty? Board 9: `. . . . . . A 0 . A`\n    *   Index 8 is `.` (empty). Index 9 is `A`.\n    *   So (8, 9) is empty. (9, 9) is an apple.\n    *   (9, 9) is an apple. (9, 0) is an apple.\n    *   (6, 9) is an apple.\n    *   Okay, so only (6, 9) is adjacent and edible.\n    *   Let's go LEFT to eat.\n\n    *   **Wait, aggression check:**\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 6).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7, 8).\n    *   Enemy moves. Where can he go?\n        *   UP to (7, 7).\n        *   DOWN to (7, 5).\n        *   LEFT to (6, 6).\n        *   RIGHT to (8, 6).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am at (7, 8).\n    *   If he goes UP to (7, 7), we are 1 square apart.\n    *   If he goes UP again next turn, we crash (if I go down).\n    *   This is a pure aggression play.\n    *   But I have no score.\n    *   The prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   Implication: If score is tied or lower, avoid suicide crash.\n    *   Therefore, getting the score first is better.\n    *   **LEFT** it is.\n\n    *   **Plan for next turn:**\n    *   Move LEFT to (6, 9) to eat the apple.\n    *   Next turn, look to move DOWN to (6, 8) to approach the enemy while keeping column 6 blocked.\n    *   Or, if the enemy moves aggressively, I can pivot.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n    *   Move LEFT: (6, 9). Is it safe?\n        *   Off board? No.\n        *   Own body? No.\n        *   Enemy body? No (Enemy is at 7,6).\n        *   Enemy head moving into me? Unlikely, he's far.\n    *   This is the best move for growth and positioning.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look at (7, 8) again.**\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am setting up a wall.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am moving out of the direct vertical line of fire.\n    *   Let's see the board state.\n    *   `9 . . . . . . A 0 . A`\n    *   `8 . . . . . . A . A .`\n    *   `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    *   `6 . . . . . . . 1 A .`\n    *   `5 . . . A . . A . . A`\n    *   `4 . . . . . . . A . .`\n    *   `3 . .

A`\n\n    *   Enemy (1) is at (7,6).\n    *   I am at (7,9).\n    *   Apple at (6,9).\n    *   Apple at (8,9).\n    *   Apple at (9,9).\n    *   Apple at (9,3).\n    *   Apple at (8,6) - wait, look at row 6: `. . . . . . . 1 A .`\n    *   (8,6) is an apple! (9,6) is empty.\n    *   The enemy is at (7,6). There is an apple at (8,6).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8), the enemy might go RIGHT to (8,6) to eat that apple.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9), I eat an apple.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am close to the enemy.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am securing a point.\n    *   Let's look at the \"Archrival\" aspect. I want to box him in.\n    *   To box him in, I need to control the space around him.\n    *   He is at column 7. I am at column 7.\n    *   If I move LEFT to column 6, I can control column 6.\n    *   If I stay at column 7 (DOWN), I am challenging column 7 directly.\n    *   Direct challenge at turn 0 with 0 score vs 0 score is risky.\n    *   Securing the apple at (6, 9) gives me the lead.\n    *   Then, with the lead, I can force collisions.\n    *   **So, LEFT is the move.**\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a trap?**\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6,9).\n    *   Next turn, if I go DOWN to (6,8).\n    *   The enemy is at (7,6).\n    *   I can then go DOWN to (6,7).\n    *   I can cut him off from the left side.\n    *   He is currently in a relatively open space, but the left side is open too.\n    *   Actually, looking at column 6:\n    *   Row 9: A (Target)\n    *   Row 8: A\n    *   Row 7: .\n    *   Row 6: . (Enemy is at 7,6)\n    *   Row 5: .\n    *   If I take (6,9) and (6,8), I own column 6.\n    *   If I own column 6, I can push him to the right wall (columns 8, 9).\n    *   The right wall has apples at (8,6), (9,5), (9,3), (9,9), (9,0).\n    *   If I push him there, he has to eat apples to grow, but he'll eventually hit the wall or me.\n    *   This is a good plan.\n    *   So, **LEFT** to start the flank.\n\n    *   **Wait, one last check on DOWN.**\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8).\n    *   Enemy might go UP to (7,7).\n    *   Then I go DOWN to (7,7) (suicide/crash) or LEFT to (6,8).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,8) and Enemy goes UP to (7,7), I am at (7,8) and he is at (7,7).\n    *   Next turn I can go LEFT to (6,8).\n    *   Then I am at (6,8) and he is at (7,7).\n    *   I can go DOWN to (6,7). He can go UP to (7,6).\n    *   I can go LEFT to (5,7). He can go UP to (7,5).\n    *   This is also a valid chase.\n    *   But with DOWN, I risk a head-on collision immediately on turn 1 or 2 if he decides to be aggressive.\n    *   With LEFT, I gain a resource first.\n    *   Usually, in these simulations, securing the first point is valuable for the \"win condition\" logic (score > score).\n    *   I will go LEFT.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Eat the apple at (6,9) to gain a point lead. Then, move DOWN along column 6 to pressure the enemy who is on column 7, pushing him towards the right wall.\n\n    *   **Move:** LEFT\n\n    *   **Wait, checking board state one last time.**\n    *   My head (7,9).\n    *   Left (6,9) is 'A'.

My plan is to grab the apple at (6,9) and then pivot hard to column 6. By taking control of the left side, we can flank the enemy who's sitting on column 7 and push him right into the wall. We're building a cage, brick by brick.\n\nLEFT",

I just ate the apple at (6, 9) last turn, so I'm growing. Now I need to make my move for this turn.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Consider Directions from (6, 9):**\n    *   **UP:** (6, 10) is off the board. DEAD.\n    *   **DOWN:** (6, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (5, 9) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (7, 9) is currently empty (my body was there last turn, but it moves out as I move). Safe.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Bad Moves:**\n    *   **UP** is instant death. \u274c\n    *   **LEFT** takes me to (5, 9), pushing me further to the edge. While safe, it limits my future moves significantly (I can't go further left).\n    *   **RIGHT** takes me back to (7, 9), basically re-establishing the vertical column with the enemy.\n    *   **DOWN** takes me to (6, 8), keeping me in the fight and centralizing my position.\n\n3.  **Analyze Safe Moves (Aggression & Strategy):**\n    *   **LEFT to (5, 9):** This moves me to the far left edge. The enemy is at (7, 6). I'm putting a wall on the left, but I'm potentially trapping myself in the corner. This feels too passive. I want to control the center and flank the enemy, not hide.\n    *   **RIGHT to (7, 9):** This puts me right back on the same x-axis as the enemy (column 7). The enemy is at (7, 6). If I go to (7, 9), I am vertical to him. If he moves UP to (7, 7), I am at (7, 9). If I move DOWN next turn to (7, 8), he could move UP to (7, 8) and we crash. It creates a direct standoff.\n    *   **DOWN to (6, 8):** This is the move. I'm at (6, 9). Moving DOWN to (6, 8) keeps me one row behind my previous position but aligns me horizontally with the enemy's potential future positions. I'm maintaining pressure on column 6/7.\n    *   **The Plan:** The enemy is at (7, 6). I am at (6, 9). If I move DOWN to (6, 8), I am effectively \"chasing\" him horizontally. If he moves UP to (7, 7), I am at (6, 8). If he moves LEFT to (6, 6), he is moving directly towards my potential path. By moving DOWN, I am preparing to cut off the top-left quadrant and push him towards the right wall. I need to stay central. If I go LEFT, I lose board presence. If I go RIGHT, I risk a direct collision on the same column. Moving DOWN gives me the most flexibility to react to his next move.\n\n4.  **Long-term Strategy:**\n    *   Secure the center-left. Force the enemy to the right side of the board (columns 7-9). Once he's cornered against the right wall, I can close in for the kill. I need to keep my path open to pivot back to the center or chase apples. Don't get trapped in the corner.\n\n**Move:** DOWN",

That's occupied by my OWN body (the neck). That's a self-collision. DEAD. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN:** To (6, 7). Currently empty. SAFE.\n    *   **LEFT:** To (5, 8). Currently empty. SAFE.\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (7, 8). Currently empty. SAFE.\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Avoiding the Trap:** I'm currently sandwiched between two apples at (6, 9) and (7, 9) (my body). Moving UP is suicide. I need to break out of this tight spot.\n    *   **The Enemy's Position:** Snake #1 is at (8, 7). He's further to the right. He's got an apple at (9, 9) and (9, 5) tempting him.\n    *   **The Goal:** Box him in. He's on the right side (column 8). I need to take space.\n    *   **Option 1: RIGHT (7, 8).** This moves me one step closer to the enemy. Risky? Maybe. But if I move here, I'm vertical to him at (8, 7). If he moves LEFT to (7, 7), we have a head-on collision. He has 1 apple, I have 2. I win the tie-breaker. Is he brave enough to challenge the score leader? Probably not.\n    *   **Option 2: LEFT (5, 8).** This opens up the board. There's an apple at (8, 2), (6, 5), etc. Moving left gives me more room to maneuver. However, it gives the enemy the entire right side. He could easily eat apples at (9, 9) or (9, 5) and grow faster.\n    *   **Option 3: DOWN (6, 7).** This is a neutral move. It keeps me central but doesn't aggressively cut off the enemy. There's an apple at (7, 3) or (6, 5) below, but it's a long walk.\n\n4.  **The Play:**\n    *   I am leading. I want to force a confrontation or at least limit his space.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT to (7, 8)**, I am putting direct pressure on his flank.\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (9, 7), he hits the wall.\n    *   If he moves UP to (8, 8), he goes for the apple at (9, 9).\n    *   If he moves DOWN to (8, 6) (his own tail), he might die or move into his tail.\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (7, 7), we crash. I win 2-1.\n    *   By moving RIGHT, I effectively force him to either retreat, challenge me (and lose), or move away. It claims the space between us.\n    *   **Safety Check:** (7, 8) is empty. My body moves out of (6, 8) into the new spot. No self-collision. No wall. It's safe.\n\n    *   **Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to assert dominance. If he doesn't crash, I will try to cut off his access to the bottom-right apples and force him into the corner at (9,9) or (9,0). I'm bigger, so I win the trade.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Grabbing it makes me score\u202f2 (tying the opponent) and grows my snake to length\u202f3, giving me more blocking power.\n2. **Space control** \u2013 Moving upward keeps me in the open top\u2011right quadrant, away from the opponent\u2019s current cluster. That space is rich with future apples (9,9, 9,5, 7,4, \u2026), letting me stay aggressive.\n3. **Future mobility** \u2013 After taking the apple my new body will be [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]. I\u2019ll still have safe moves left, while the opponent remains boxed near the middle\u2011top edge with fewer escape routes.\n4. **Avoid traps** \u2013 Heading LEFT would bring me closer to the opponent\u2019s body, risking a cut\u2011off. Heading RIGHT hugs the wall early and may limit later maneuverability.\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 The safest, most point\u2011effective, and positionally advantageous move is to head **UP** and claim the apple at (8,8).\n\nUP",

Wait, looking closer at the board visual:\n            *   Row 9: `T` is at (7, 9)? No, looking at the coordinates: `(9) . . . . . . T . . A`. This implies (6,9) is `T`? No, wait. Let's map the board.\n            *   Row 9: `.` at 0, `.` at 1... `.` at 6, `T` at 7? No, looking at the snake list: My body includes (6, 9). The enemy body does not extend to row 9.\n            *   Wait, the board visual says:\n                9 `. . . . . . T . . A`\n            *   My body is at (6, 9) and (6, 8). The `T` at (7, 9) must be the tail of Snake #1? No, Snake #1 is at (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6).\n            *   Actually, looking at the provided state: `Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8), Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6)]`.\n            *   My Body: `[(6, 8), (6, 9)]`.\n            *   Board row 8: `. . . . . . T 0 1 .`. (6,8) is `T`? No, (6,8) is my body. The `T` here is weird. Let's look at row 9: `9 . . . . . . T . . A`. (7,9) is `T`.\n            *   Okay, `T` likely denotes a Snake body part that isn't the head. The board is a visual map.\n            *   (7, 9): Is it occupied? The board shows `T` at (7,9). That means I cannot go UP.\n    *   **DOWN:** To (7, 7). Board row 7: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (6, 8). This is my own body (neck). **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (8, 8). This is the Enemy Head. If I move there and he moves anywhere, I die (head-on collision or running into body). **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Only UP, DOWN, or RIGHT were possible based on map.**\n    *   UP is (7, 9). Visual says `T`. Assuming `T` is an obstacle (snake body), I cannot go there.\n    *   RIGHT is (8, 8). Enemy Head. If I go there and he moves, I die. If I stay and he comes to (7, 8), he dies. But I must move.\n    *   DOWN is (7, 7). Empty.\n    *   **Wait, let's re-verify the board.**\n        *   Row 9: `9 . . . . . . T . . A` -> (7,9) is `T`.\n        *   Row 8: `8 . . . . . . T 0 1 .` -> (7,8) is `0` (Me), (8,8) is `1` (Enemy).\n    *   My Neck is (6, 8). I cannot go LEFT.\n    *   I cannot go RIGHT to (8, 8) because that's where the enemy is *now*. If I move there, we collide. Since we have equal score (2-2), a head-on collision results in a draw (or I die because I initiated the move into him? Actually, rules say: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH snakes die.\" But here, he is already there. If I move into his current head, that's a head-on collision. If he moves into my current head, that's head-on. We move simultaneously.\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (8,8) and he moves ANYWHERE, I am moving into the cell he occupies *before* the move. Is that a collision?\n        *   Standard Snake rules: You crash into *future* positions.\n        *   \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\" (This includes current positions? No, usually simultaneous movement).\n        *   \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH die.\"\n        *   If I am at (7,8) and he is at (8,8). I move RIGHT to (8,8). He moves UP to (8,9). We don't collide. I occupy (8,8), he occupies (8,9).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (8,8) and he moves LEFT to (7,8), we collide in the middle (swap places?) or cross paths? Usually, crossing paths (A->B, B->A) is death in some versions, but standard simultaneous is safe *unless* you swap heads into the other's body.\n        *   However, if he moves LEFT to (7,8) and I move RIGHT to (8,8), we are crossing. In many snake games, crossing paths is death. The prompt says: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\" If he moves to (7,8), and I am *moving* to (8,8), am I moving into his body? No.\n        *   BUT, if he stays at (8,8) and I move there, I crash.\n        *   If he moves to (7,8) (my current spot) and I move to (8,8) (his current spot), do we crash?\n        *   Let's assume standard simultaneous: We look at destination.\n        *   My Dest: (8,8).\n        *   His Dest: ?\n        *   If he moves UP (8,9): Safe.\n        *   If he moves LEFT (7,8): I am moving to (8,8), he is moving to (7,8). We swap. Is swapping heads death? The prompt says \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell... BOTH die.\" Swapping isn't the same cell.\n        *   However, if he moves LEFT, my head moves into (8,8) which is *his current head*. Wait, simultaneous. He leaves (8,8). I arrive (8,8).\n        *   The risk is if he doesn't move (unlikely) or moves into me.\n        *   **Crucially:** He is at (8,8). I am at (7,8).\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (8,8), I am challenging him.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (7,7), I retreat.\n    *   **Apple Focus:** There is an apple at (9,9) right above him. There is an apple at (7,4) below.\n    *   **The Trap:** If I go DOWN, I go for the apple at (7,4). He might go for (9,9).\n    *   **The Aggression:** I am tied 2-2. I want to force a confrontation.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I am essentially saying \"Move or die\".\n    *   Is (8,8) occupied? Yes, by his head.\n    *   Wait, the board says `8 . . . . . . T 0 1 .` at indices 6, 7, 8.\n        *   (6,8): `T` (My body?)\n        *   (7,8): `0` (Me)\n        *   (8,8): `1` (Enemy)\n    *   So (8,8) is the enemy head.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I move into the enemy head.\n    *   **Rule check:** \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body... You're DEAD.\"\n    *   If I move into the cell he currently occupies, do I die?\n    *   Usually, in simultaneous snake, you check if your *destination* is occupied by a body/tail *at the start of the turn*, or if you move into a head that is also moving there.\n    *   If I move to (8,8) and he moves to (8,9), (8,8) becomes empty (he left) and I enter. Safe.\n    *   If I move to (8,8) and he stays (impossible), I crash.\n    *   If I move to (8,8) and he moves to (7,8), we swap. If \"crossing paths\" is death, I die. If not, I survive.\n    *   The prompt says: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\n    *   It doesn't explicitly say crossing paths is death, but it's a risk.\n    *   **Alternative:** DOWN to (7,7).\n        *   Is it safe? Yes.\n        *   Does it give me space? Yes.\n        *   Is there an apple nearby? (7,4) is down.\n        *   (6,5) is also an apple.\n    *   **Enemy Position:** He is at (8,8). He wants (9,9).\n    *   If I go DOWN, I avoid collision.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I risk collision.\n    *   **Score:** 2-2. Tie.\n    *   If we collide (head-on), we both die. Since we have equal apples, it's a draw.\n    *   I want to WIN, not draw.\n    *   However, if I force a collision and he dies but I survive? Impossible if heads collide.\n    *   What if I move RIGHT and he moves UP into (9,9)? I take (8,8). He takes (9,9). No collision.\n    *   But wait, he is at (8,8). I am at (7,8).\n    *   My move RIGHT puts me at (8,8).\n    *   His move UP puts him at (8,9).\n    *   This is safe for both.\n    *   **However**, what if he moves LEFT? (7,8).\n    *   I move to (8,8), he moves to (7,8). We swap.\n    *   Is swapping death? Standard rule: Head-to-head collision (same cell) is death. Swapping is usually death if body collision is checked.\n    *   If I move to (8,8), is his tail at (8,6)? Yes.\n    *   If I move to (8,8), is there a body there? His head *was* there.\n    *   **Strategy:** I am at (7,8). If I go DOWN to (7,7), I am safe.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am moving towards the center.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I am pinning him against the wall?\n    *   He is at (8,8). Wall is at 9.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (8,8), I am stepping on his toes.\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n        *   (9,9) is an apple.\n        *   (9,0) is an apple.\n        *   (8,8) is Enemy.\n        *   (7,8) is Me.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (8,8), I am moving into his space.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,7), I open up the board.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   **RIGHT (8,8):** High risk. If he moves UP, we are adjacent (I at 8,8, him at 8,9). Safe. If he moves LEFT, we swap/crash? If we crash, draw. I don't want a draw. I want a win.\n        *   **DOWN (7,7):** Low risk. I gain space. I can target (7,4) or (6,5).\n    *   **Aggressive Play:** The prompt says \"Be aggressive and try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    *   **Current Score:** 2-2. I do NOT have a higher score.\n    *   Therefore, I should NOT force a head-on collision.\n    *   I should play safe to gain an advantage.\n    *   **DOWN** is the logical safe move.\n    *   Is (7,7) empty? Row 7: `. . . . . . . . . .` (Visual check).\n        *   Row 7 in the board state:\n            `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n            (0,7) to (9,7) are all dots.\n            (7,7) is a dot. It is empty.\n    *   **LEFT** is (6,8) which is my body. **DEAD.**\n    *   **UP** is (7,9). Visual check: `9 . . . . . . T . . A`. (7,9) is `T` (Snake body part). **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT** is (8,8). Enemy head. **RISKY (Draw potential).**\n    *   **DOWN** is (7,7). **SAFE.**\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move DOWN to (7,7). This gives me access to the apples at (6,5) and (7,4). I will gain apples and length, then crush him later when I have a score advantage.\n    *   **Enemy Move Prediction:** He will likely move UP to (9,9) to eat the apple, or LEFT to (7,8) (if he wants to challenge, but he's tied). He probably wants to eat.\n    *   If he eats (9,9), he becomes 3 apples.\n    *   I need to eat too.\n    *   From (7,7), I can go to (7,6) -> (7,5) -> (7,4) (Apple).\n    *   Or (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) (Apple).\n    *   Both are viable.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (8,2)?** Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple at (6,4)? Yes.\n    *   **Visual Check on (7,9):** `T`. Is that my tail? My tail is (6,9). So (7,9) is likely part of Snake #1's body?\n        *   Snake #1 Body: [(8,7), (8,6)].\n        *   Wait, the board says `9 . . . . . . T . . A`.\n        *   If (7,9) is `T`, it's a snake body. Which snake?\n        *   My body is at (6,9) and (6,8).\n        *   Enemy body is at (8,7) and (8,6).\n        *   Where does (7,9) come from?\n        *   Maybe the `T` represents a tail.\n        *   If (7,9) is a tail, it might be the enemy's tail *if* he was previously longer? No, he has 2 apples. Length 3. Head (8,8), Body (8,7), Tail (8,6).\n        *   Maybe the board visualization `T` is just a generic \"Snake Body\" marker.\n        *   Let's look at the Enemy: Head (8,8), Body (8,7), Body (8,6).\n        *   My Body: (6,8), (6,9).\n        *   (7,9) is NOT in my body list.\n        *   (7,9) is NOT in enemy body list.\n        *   **BUT** the board says `T` there.\n        *   Could it be a typo in the board vs the list?\n        *   List: `Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8), Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6)]`.\n        *   Visual: `8 . . . . . . T 0 1 .` -> (6,8) is `T`. (7,8) is `0`. (8,8) is `1`.\n            *   (6,8) is `T`? My list says my body is (6,8). So `T` is MY body.\n            *   So (7,9) is `T` on row 9.\n            *   My body: (6,9) is at x=6, y=9.\n            *   (7,9) is at x=7, y=9.\n            *   My body does NOT include (7,9).\n            *   Enemy body does NOT include (7,9).\n            *   So why is it `T`?\n            *   Maybe the `T` at (7,9) is a mistake or I'm misreading the coordinate mapping.\n            *   Let's trust the LIST over the visual `T` if they conflict, BUT (7,9) is not in any list.\n            *   Wait, look at the visual again:\n                9 `. . . . . . T . . A`\n                8 `. . . . . . T 0 1 .`\n            *   (6,9) is `T`.\n            *   (6,8) is `T`.\n            *   This matches my body at (6,8) and (6,9).\n            *   So (6,8) and (6,9) are `T`.\n            *   What about (7,9)? The visual shows `T` at index 7? No, let's count the dots.\n            *   Row 9: `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `.` `.` `A`\n            *   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n            *   So (6,9) is `T`.\n            *   (7,9) is `.` (Dot/Empty).\n            *   **I misread the visual.**\n            *   (6,9) is `T`. (7,9) is empty.\n            *   **UP to (7,9) is EMPTY.**\n    *   **Re-evaluating UP:**\n        *   Destination (7,9). Is it empty? Yes.\n        *   Is it safe? Yes.\n        *   Is there an apple? No. Row 9 has an apple at (9,9) and (9,0).\n        *   Moving UP moves me closer to (9,9)? No, it moves me to y=9, x=7.\n        *   Enemy is at (8,8).\n        *   If I go UP to (7,9), I am adjacent to Enemy Head at (8,8).\n        *   If Enemy moves UP to (8,9), we are adjacent (7,9) vs (8,9). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (7,8), we are at (7,9) vs (7,8). Safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (9,8), safe.\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (8,7), safe.\n        *   **However**, moving UP to (7,9) puts me on the wall (top row).\n        *   Moving DOWN to (7,7) puts me in the open.\n        *   **Which is better?**\n        *   UP: Top row. Limited moves (Down, Left, Right? Left is (6,9) which is my body!).\n            *   If I go UP to (7,9).\n            *   Next turn options:\n                *   UP: Off board (9 is max y). Dead.\n                *   LEFT: (6,9). My body. Dead.\n                *   RIGHT: (8,9). Empty (mostly).\n                *   DOWN: (7,8). My current spot (will be empty by then).\n            *   So from (7,9), I would be forced to go RIGHT or DOWN.\n            *   Going UP is a \"One Way\" street. I go there, I can't go back left or up.\n        *   DOWN: (7,7).\n            *   Next turn options:\n                *   UP: (7,8) (Safe).\n                *   DOWN: (7,6) (Safe).\n                *   LEFT: (6,7) (Safe).\n                *   RIGHT: (8,7) (Potentially Enemy Body).\n            *   Much more freedom.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   UP is risky because it traps me on the wall. My tail is at (6,9). If I go UP to (7,9), I am stuck next to my own body on the left.\n        *   DOWN is open.\n        *   RIGHT is aggressive but risky (collision).\n        *   LEFT is death (into self).\n        *   **DOWN (7,7)** is the smartest move to maintain options and stay alive.\n        *   I need to eat apples. (7,4) is reachable.\n        *   I should not challenge him head-on since we are tied.\n        *   I will move DOWN.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (7,7) to open up the board and head towards the apple at (7,4). Avoid risky collisions until I have a score lead.\n\nDOWN",

Let's break down the board state like a pro.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (7, 7). Body at (7, 8) and (6, 8). Apples: 2.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (9, 8). Body at (8, 8) and (8, 7). Apples: 2.\n*   **The Situation:** The enemy is stacked up on the right wall (x=8,9). I am sitting at x=7. There is a massive open space to my LEFT (x=0-6) and DOWN (y=0-6).\n*   **The Threat:** If I stay near the right side, the enemy can easily box me in against the wall. I need to claim territory.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES:**\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** HITS MY OWN BODY! Dead immediately. \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** This is currently occupied by the enemy's body (Snake #1's tail is at (8, 7)). If I move there, I die. \ud83d\udeab\n3.  **DOWN (7, 6):** This is open! But look at the board. (7,6) is clear. However, I need to think about the enemy's move.\n4.  **LEFT (6, 7):** This is open!\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe apple at (7, 4) is tempting, but moving DOWN to (7, 6) keeps me close to the enemy's cluster. I need space to maneuver. The enemy is trapped against the wall at x=8/9. If I go **LEFT**, I open up the entire left side of the board (x=0-6). This is the \"Box In\" strategy. I claim the territory, force the enemy to stay in their small corner, and wait for them to crash into themselves or the wall.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6, 7):\n*   I am safe from my own body.\n*   I am safe from the enemy (they are at x=8/9).\n*   I gain control of the center and left side.\n*   I can easily sweep for apples at (5,2), (2,1), (2,3), etc., later.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I stay on the right side where the enemy is. That's dangerous. I need to separate us.\n\n**PLAN:**\nGo **LEFT** to claim the center-left territory. Trap the enemy on the right wall. Force them to make a mistake. Once I have more apples than them (score lead), I can force a head-on collision or block them completely.\n\nChat, watch me steal the map! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

The board is shrinking, and that enemy snake is lurking at the top right.\n\nLet's break down the current state:\n\n**BOARD SCAN:**\n*   **My Head:** (6, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 7), (7, 8)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 9)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]\n*   **Apple Radar:** (6, 4) is juicy and close. (5, 2), (2, 1), (1, 0) are potential paths.\n\n**MOVEMENT EVALUATION:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* The cell (6, 8) is currently **EMPTY** on the board state.\n    *   *Risk:* The enemy is at (9, 9). They could move down to (9, 8) or left to (8, 9). They are far away.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Moving UP keeps me high on the board, close to the apple at (6, 4) and keeps my escape route open towards the left side. It expands my territory.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (6, 6) is **EMPTY**.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Good for safety, moves me toward the lower apples like (5, 2) and (2, 1). However, it puts my head closer to the bottom edge, potentially limiting upward mobility later. I need to control the center.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (5, 7) is **EMPTY**.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Good move to claim more territory and head towards the center-left apples. A solid option.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** My body is at (7, 7). I cannot move into my own body.\n    *   *Verdict:* \ud83d\udeab **DO NOT MOVE HERE.**\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\nI need to position myself to intercept apples and threaten the enemy while keeping my options open. The enemy is pinned to the right wall (x=8,9). If I move **UP**, I cut off the top-left quadrant and position myself to drop down on apples later. Moving left is safe, but moving up maximizes board control given my current body shape (an 'L' shape at (6,7)-(7,7)-(7,8)). Moving up to (6,8) allows me to pivot left or right next turn.\n\nChat, we're taking the high ground! Let's control the flow.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to (6,8) to claim the upper middle territory. From there, I can look to sweep apples at (6,4) or pivot left to (5,8) to cut off the enemy's expansion. Keep the pressure on!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

          "rationale": "**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT'S UP CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Turn 6 is here! Score check: I'm at 2 apples, they're at 3. I gotta close that gap, but more importantly, I gotta stay alive and aggressive. They have 3 apples, so their length is 4 (Head + 3 body). I have 2 apples, so my length is 3. If we head-on collide, I lose because they have more apples. I cannot take a head-on collision.\n\nLet's check the board state from Turn 5.\nMy Head: (6, 8)\nMy Body: (6, 7), (7, 7)\nOpponent Head: (9, 9)\nOpponent Body: (9, 9) is head, (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7) are body? Wait, the board shows:\nRow 9: T at (9,9). T at (8,8)? No.\nLet's re-read the board state carefully.\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 T (Wait, the board shows \"1 T\" at (8,9) and (9,9)? No, let's parse the ASCII.\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . . 1 T`\nIndices 0-9.\n(8,9) is '1' (Snake #1 Head? No, wait. The list says Head: (8,9). But the board shows 'T' at (9,9).\nLet's look at the description: \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 9), Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\".\nWait, the board shows:\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . . 1 T`\nLet's map this:\nCol 0: .\nCol 1: .\nCol 2: .\nCol 3: .\nCol 4: .\nCol 5: .\nCol 6: .\nCol 7: .\nCol 8: 1 (Snake #1 Head?)\nCol 9: T (Snake #1 Body?)\nBut the text says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 9), Body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\".\nWait, coordinates are (x, y). x is column, y is row.\nHead is at x=8, y=9. That matches the '1' at column 8, row 9 in the ASCII.\nBody is at (9,9), (9,8), (8,8).\nSo the ASCII map:\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . . 1 T` -> (8,9) is '1', (9,9) is 'T'. Correct.\nRow 8: `. . . . . . 0 . T T` -> (6,8) is '0', (8,8) is 'T', (9,8) is 'T'. Correct.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . T T . .` -> (6,7) is 'T', (7,7) is 'T'. Correct.\n\nSo the board is confirmed.\nMy Head: (6, 8)\nMy Body: (6, 7), (7, 7)\nOpponent Head: (8, 9)\nOpponent Body: (9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (6, 9) is currently Empty ('.').\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* Enemy Head is at (8, 9). They could move Left to (7, 9) or Down to (8, 8).\n    *   *Collision Risk:* If I go UP to (6, 9) and they go LEFT to (7, 9), we are safe (distance 1).\n    *   *Risk:* If I go UP and they go LEFT, we are adjacent. If I go UP and they go DOWN (into their own body?), no.\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Moving UP puts me at y=9. I am in the top row. This limits my future moves (only Left, Right, Down). The opponent is also at y=9. This creates a confrontation on the top row. However, the opponent is at (8,9). If I go to (6,9), I am at the left side of the top row.\n    *   *Dead End Risk:* High. Top row is a wall. If I go to (6,9), I can only go Left (5,9), Right (7,9), or Down (6,8). Right (7,9) is risky because it approaches the enemy. Left (5,9) is a wall eventually. Down (6,8) is my previous head.\n    *   *Rivalries:* \"box him in\". The opponent is at x=8. If I go to x=6, I am not boxing him in. He has x=8,9. I am at x=6. There is a gap at x=7.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* **DEATH.** (6, 7) is my body. I cannot move into my own body.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (5, 8) is Empty ('.').\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* Enemy at (8,9).\n    *   *Strategic Value:* This moves me Left, away from the opponent on the right side. It opens up the center.\n    *   *Future Options:* From (5, 8), I can go UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8). 4 options. Good mobility.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* (7, 8) is Empty ('.').\n    *   *Enemy Interaction:* This moves me closer to the opponent. Distance becomes 1 (from (7,8) to (8,9) is diagonally adjacent, but Manhattan distance is 2. Wait, (7,8) to (8,9) is distance |7-8| + |8-9| = 2).\n    *   *Risk:* If I go RIGHT to (7,8), and the opponent goes DOWN to (8,8)? No, (8,8) is their body. They die if they do that.\n    *   *Risk:* If I go RIGHT, and opponent goes LEFT to (7,9)? Then I am at (7,8), they are at (7,9). We are vertical neighbors. Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* If I go RIGHT, and opponent goes DOWN-LEFT (impossible, only cardinal).\n    *   *Strategic Value:* Moving RIGHT puts me at (7,8). From there, I can block the top row or move down. However, I am entering the enemy's territory. The opponent is cornered at (8,9)-(9,9)-(9,8)-(8,8). If I go to (7,8), I am directly next to their body at (8,8).\n    *   *Future Options:* From (7,8), I can go UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). RIGHT (8,8) is their body. UP (7,9) is empty. DOWN (7,7) is my body. LEFT (6,8) is empty. So I have 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT). Right is blocked by enemy, Down is blocked by me. This is getting trapped.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLeft to (5, 8) gives me 4 safe options.\nRight to (7, 8) gives me 2 safe options (and puts me next to the enemy).\nUp to (6, 9) gives me 3 safe options but traps me on the wall.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\"box him in and make him crash out\". The opponent is at (8,9). To box him in, I need to control the space around him.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), I am moving away from him. That is not boxing him in.\nIf I move UP to (6,9), I am moving to the top row. From there, I can move Right to (7,9) next turn to block his escape to the left. Or I can stay at (6,9) and he stays at (8,9). There is a gap.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), I am cutting off his access to the left side of the board. He is at x=8. If I am at x=7, he is confined to x=8,9. This is the definition of \"boxing him in\".\n\nHowever, boxing him in requires me to survive.\nOpponent length = 4. My length = 3.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8):\n- Opponent moves DOWN to (8,8)? No, (8,8) is body. He dies.\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9). I am at (7,8). Safe.\n- Opponent moves DOWN-LEFT? Impossible.\n- Opponent moves DOWN? No.\n- Opponent moves UP? Off board.\n- Opponent moves RIGHT? Off board.\n\nSo the only safe move for opponent if I move RIGHT is LEFT to (7,9) or staying (but he has to move).\nIf he moves LEFT to (7,9):\n- I am at (7,8).\n- Next turn, I can move UP to (7,9) and kill him? No, he is there now. Wait, simultaneous movement.\n- If I am at (7,8) and he is at (7,9), distance is 1.\n- If I move UP to (7,9) and he moves DOWN to (7,8), we collide heads -> I lose (2 apples vs 3).\n- If I move LEFT to (6,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,8), we collide -> I lose.\n- If I move RIGHT to (8,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,8), I hit his body -> I die.\n\nSo if I move RIGHT to (7,8), I am putting myself in a position where next turn I have to be very careful.\nLet's look at LEFT to (5,8).\nOpponent at (8,9).\nIf I move LEFT:\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- Distance: (5,8) to (7,9) is 3.\n- I am safe. I have space.\n\n**Aggression vs Safety:**\nThe prompt says: \"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI have LOWER score (2 vs 3). I CANNOT force a head-on collision. I will lose.\nTherefore, I must avoid head-on collisions.\nMoving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy and limits my escape routes.\nMoving LEFT opens up the board and keeps me safe.\n\nHowever, the prompt also says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nIf I move LEFT, I am ignoring the enemy (moving away). This allows him to breathe in the top right corner.\nIf I move UP, I can potentially cut him off next turn by moving RIGHT to (7,9).\nLet's analyze UP to (6,9).\nCurrent pos: (6,8). Move UP -> (6,9).\nOpponent at (8,9).\nIf opponent moves LEFT to (7,9):\n- I am at (6,9), he is at (7,9). Distance 1.\n- Next turn, if I move RIGHT to (7,9) and he moves LEFT to (6,9), we collide -> I lose.\n- If I stay at (6,9) and he moves LEFT to (6,9), he dies? No, he moves into my head? Wait, simultaneous.\n- If he moves LEFT to (6,9) and I stay (impossible, I have to move). If I move LEFT to (5,9) and he moves LEFT to (6,9), he hits my tail? No, my tail is (7,7).\n- Actually, if I move UP to (6,9), and he moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- I am at (6,9). He is at (7,9).\n- My possible moves next turn: LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9), DOWN (6,8).\n- His possible moves: LEFT (6,9), DOWN (7,8).\n- If I move RIGHT (7,9) and he moves LEFT (6,9), we swap safely.\n- If I move RIGHT (7,9) and he moves DOWN (7,8), we collide -> I lose.\n- If I move LEFT (5,9) and he moves LEFT (6,9), we are safe.\n- If I move LEFT (5,9) and he moves DOWN (7,8), safe.\n\nSo UP is risky if I commit to moving RIGHT next turn into him.\nBut if I move UP and he moves LEFT to (7,9), I can just move LEFT to (5,9) to retreat and keep the top row block?\nWait, if I move UP to (6,9), I am on the top row. The only way back is DOWN.\nIf I go UP to (6,9), I am cutting off the top row for him from the left side.\nHe is at x=8. If I am at x=6, he has x=8,9. He is cornered.\nIf he moves LEFT to (7,9), he is at x=7.\nIf I then move LEFT to (5,9), I am at x=5. He is at x=7. He has space.\nIf I want to box him in, I need to be at x=7 or x=8.\nTo box him in, I should move to x=7 or x=8.\n\nOption: Move RIGHT to (7,8).\nThis puts me at x=7, y=8. He is at x=8, y=9.\nI am directly below and to the left of him.\nFrom (7,8), if I move UP to (7,9), I am on his left side.\nFrom (7,8), if I move RIGHT to (8,8), I hit his body.\nFrom (7,8), if I move LEFT to (6,8), I retreat.\nFrom (7,8), if I move DOWN to (7,7), I hit my body.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8):\n- Opponent must move. He can only move LEFT (7,9) because other moves are blocked (DOWN is body, RIGHT is wall, UP is wall).\n- So opponent will move LEFT to (7,9).\n- New State: Me at (7,8), Opponent at (7,9).\n- This is vertical adjacency.\n- My apples: 2. His apples: 3.\n- Next turn, if I move UP to (7,9), we collide heads -> I lose.\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), we collide heads -> I lose.\n- So we must avoid moving into each other.\n- I can move LEFT to (6,8) or DOWN (blocked) or RIGHT (blocked) or UP (die).\n- He can move LEFT (6,9) or DOWN (7,8) or UP/WALL.\n- If I move LEFT to (6,8) and he moves LEFT to (6,9), safe.\n- If I move LEFT to (6,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,8), we collide -> I lose.\n\nSo moving RIGHT creates a situation where we are adjacent. The opponent is trapped. He has 1 or 2 safe moves. I have 1 or 2 safe moves.\nThis is high tension.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8):\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- Me at (5,8), Him at (7,9).\n- We are far apart. I can grow safely.\n\n**The Goal:** \"box him in and make him crash out\".\nIf I move LEFT (5,8), I am giving up on boxing him in immediately. I am playing a long game.\nIf I move RIGHT (7,8), I am forcing a confrontation.\nIf I move UP (6,9), I am positioning to cut him off.\n\nLet's reconsider UP to (6,9).\nIf I go UP to (6,9).\nOpponent goes LEFT to (7,9).\nMe: (6,9). Him: (7,9).\nI can move LEFT to (5,9). He can move LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN (7,8).\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,9) and I move LEFT to (5,9), safe.\nIf he moves DOWN to (7,8) and I move LEFT to (5,9), safe.\nThis gives me control of the top row from x=0 to x=6. He is at x=7. He is squeezed to the right.\nThis seems like the best \"boxing in\" strategy without putting my head directly adjacent to his head (which is dangerous given the score difference).\n\nWait, if I move UP to (6,9):\n- I am at y=9.\n- If he moves LEFT to (7,9), we are at (6,9) and (7,9).\n- If I move LEFT to (5,9) next turn, I am safe.\n- He is still at (7,9).\n- Now, from (5,9) and (7,9), I have him pinned against the right wall (x=8,9).\n- He is at x=7. He has x=8,9 available to his right.\n- If I can get to x=7 or x=8, he is dead.\n- But I am at x=5.\n- To box him in, I need to take x=7 or x=8.\n- If I move RIGHT from (5,9) to (6,9), he is at (7,9).\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,9), he must move. If he moves RIGHT to (8,9) or DOWN to (7,8).\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), I am at (7,9). Safe.\n- If he moves RIGHT to (8,9), I am at (7,9). Safe.\n- Then I can chase him.\n\nHowever, there is an Apple at (9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 4), (5, 2)...\nThe apples are mostly on the right side or bottom.\nIf I move UP to (6,9), I am moving away from the apples at (5,2), (2,1) etc.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), I am closer to (5,2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), I am closer to (7,4), (9,5).\n\nLet's look at the apple (6,4).\nIf I move UP to (6,9), distance to (6,4) is 5.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), distance to (6,4) is 5.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), distance to (6,4) is 4.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nThe enemy is at (8,9).\nDominating the board means controlling the space.\nThe enemy is cornered.\nIf I move UP to (6,9), I cut off the top left.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), I cut off the middle left.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), I ignore him.\n\nLet's analyze the \"boxing in\" more carefully.\nThe enemy is at (8,9). His body is at (9,9), (9,8), (8,8).\nHe is trapped in a 2x2 corner (x=8,9 and y=8,9).\nHe can ONLY move to (7,9) to escape.\nIf I can control (7,9), he is dead (he has no moves).\nTo control (7,9), I need to be at (7,9) or (7,8) (so I can move up) or (6,9) (so I can move right).\nIf I am at (6,9), I can move RIGHT to (7,9) next turn.\nIf I am at (7,8), I can move UP to (7,9) next turn.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,9):\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9) (his only safe move).\n- Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7,9).\n- Opponent is at (7,9). He can move LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8).\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,9) and he moves LEFT to (6,9), we collide -> I lose (2 vs 3).\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,9) and he moves DOWN to (7,8), we collide -> I lose (2 vs 3).\n- So I cannot move into him.\n\nI need to force him to crash.\nIf I am at (6,9) and he is at (7,9).\nI move LEFT to (5,9).\nHe moves? He is at (7,9). He can go LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8).\nIf he goes LEFT to (6,9), he is safe.\nIf he goes DOWN to (7,8), he is safe.\nI haven't boxed him in. I've just pushed him away from the wall.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8):\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- I am at (7,8). He is at (7,9).\n- Next turn, if I move UP to (7,9) -> Collision -> I lose.\n- If I move LEFT to (6,8), he can move DOWN to (7,8) -> Collision -> I lose.\n- If I move LEFT (6,8) and he moves LEFT (6,9) -> Safe.\n- If I move LEFT (6,8) and he moves DOWN (7,8) -> Collision.\n- So I am relying on him NOT moving DOWN.\n- Why would he move DOWN? To chase an apple? To survive?\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), he hits my tail? No, my tail is (7,7).\n- Wait, if he moves DOWN to (7,8), and I move UP to (7,9), we are safe.\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), and I move LEFT to (6,8), we collide.\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), and I move RIGHT to (8,8) (his body), I die.\n- If he moves DOWN to (7,8), and I move DOWN to (7,7) (my body), I die.\n\nSo if I am at (7,8) and he is at (7,9):\n- I MUST move UP (die), LEFT (risk collision), RIGHT (die), DOWN (die).\n- Actually, from (7,8), I can move LEFT (6,8) or UP (7,9).\n- If I move UP, I die.\n- If I move LEFT, I risk him moving DOWN.\n- If I move LEFT, and he moves LEFT, safe.\n- If I move LEFT, and he moves DOWN, I die.\n\nThis is a losing position for me. I have 2 apples, he has 3. I cannot risk a 50/50 collision where I lose.\nMoving RIGHT is bad.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,9):\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- I am at (6,9). He is at (7,9).\n- I can move LEFT to (5,9).\n- He can move LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN (7,8).\n- If he moves LEFT (6,9) and I move LEFT (5,9), safe.\n- If he moves DOWN (7,8) and I move LEFT (5,9), safe.\n- This seems safer.\n\nIs there a better option?\nWhat about moving DOWN?\nDOWN to (6,7) is death (my body).\n\nWhat about moving LEFT?\nLEFT to (5,8).\n- Opponent moves LEFT to (7,9).\n- I am at (5,8). He is at (7,9).\n- I am far away. I can go for apples at (5,2), (2,1), (1,0).\n- I can grow my score.\n- The prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n- I do NOT have a higher score. I am losing.\n- I need to grow. \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n- If I grow to 3 apples, I tie his length. Then I can be aggressive.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,8) gives me access to the left side of the board where apples are clustered: (5,2), (2,1), (1,0).\n- The enemy is trapped in the top right. He is not an immediate threat to the left side.\n- By moving LEFT, I am securing territory and food.\n- The enemy is contained. If he tries to cross the board to get to the left side apples, he has to traverse a long distance, risking running into me or walls.\n- So the strategy is: Secure the food on the left, grow up, then return to crush him.\n- This aligns with \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\nLet's double check the \"boxing him in\" requirement.\n\"box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nIf I leave him alone, he might find an apple on the right side (there are apples at (9,0), (9,3), (9,5), (8,2), (7,3), (6,4), (6,5)).\nHe has food near him too.\nIf I go LEFT, he eats on the right. He grows. He becomes stronger.\nBut I also grow.\nThe board is 10x10. It's big enough for maneuvering.\nIf I trap him now, I risk my life (2 vs 3 score).\nIf I wait, I can get to 3 or 4 apples and then trap him with equal or greater strength.\n\nIs there a way to box him in without risking collision?\nOnly if I can block all his moves without being adjacent to his head.\nHe is at (8,9). Body (9,9), (9,8), (8,8).\nHe can move to (7,9).\nTo block him, I need to be at (7,9).\nIf I am at (7,9), he cannot move there.\nBut if I am at (7,9), where is his head? He moves simultaneously.\nIf I move to (7,9) this turn:\n- He moves from (8,9). He cannot move to (7,9) if I am there.\n- But he moves at the same time.\n- If I move RIGHT to (7,8) -> (Wait, (7,8) is not (7,9)).\n- To get to (7,9), I need to move RIGHT from (6,9) or UP from (7,8).\n- To get to (6,9), I move UP from (6,8).\n- To get to (7,8), I move RIGHT from (6,8).\n- To get to (7,9), I need to be at (7,8) and move UP, or (6,9) and move RIGHT.\n\nScenario A: Move UP to (6,9).\n- Me: (6,8) -> (6,9)\n- Enemy: (8,9) -> (7,9) (Likely his only move)\n- Next turn, I am at (6,9), Enemy at (7,9).\n- I can move RIGHT to (7,9) -> Head on collision -> I lose.\n- I can move LEFT to (5,9) -> Safe.\n- I can move DOWN to (6,8) -> Safe.\n- I cannot trap him this turn. I can only push him.\n\nScenario B: Move RIGHT to (7,8).\n- Me: (6,8) -> (7,8)\n- Enemy: (8,9) -> (7,9)\n- I am at (7,8), Enemy at (7,9).\n- Next turn, I am adjacent.\n- I cannot move UP (collision risk).\n- I can move LEFT (6,8).\n- If I move LEFT, Enemy moves? He is at (7,9). He can go LEFT (6,9) or DOWN (7,8).\n- If he goes DOWN (7,8), we collide -> I lose.\n- This is dangerous.\n\nScenario C: Move LEFT to (5,8).\n- Me: (6,8) -> (5,8)\n- Enemy: (8,9) -> (7,9)\n- Distance is large.\n- I am safe. I can eat apples on the left.\n- I grow. I become stronger.\n- The enemy is contained in the top right.\n- Even if he eats apples, he is still stuck in that corner until he moves down.\n- Once I am strong (3+ apples), I can go back to the center and cut him off.\n\nThe prompt says: \"box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nThis implies an immediate tactical goal.\nHowever, \"Do not focus on where the apples are\" is balanced by \"Grow as a means of dominating the board\".\nAnd \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score\" implies \"Do NOT force a head-on collision if you have a lower score\".\n\nI have a lower score. I must avoid head-on collisions.\nScenario B (Right) puts me in a position where head-on collision is likely next turn.\nScenario A (Up) puts me in a position where I can retreat.\nScenario C (Left) avoids collision entirely.\n\nIf I box him in, I am forcing a conflict. If I am weaker, I lose the conflict.\nTherefore, I should grow first.\nI will move LEFT to (5,8).\nFrom (5,8), I am heading towards (5,2) and (2,1).\nThis is the safest and most strategic move for my current state.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (6,4)? Yes.\nFrom (5,8), I can move DOWN towards (5,4) then RIGHT to (6,4).\nFrom (6,8), moving UP or RIGHT keeps me close to (6,4) too.\nBut LEFT moves me away from (6,4).\nHowever, (6,4) is not \"safe\" if the enemy is chasing it.\nThe enemy is far away. He can't reach (6,4) in one turn.\nActually, the enemy is at (8,9). Distance to (6,4) is |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7.\nMy distance to (6,4) is |6-6| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4.\nI am closer.\nBut if I move LEFT, my distance becomes 5.\nIf I move UP, my distance becomes 5.\nIf I move RIGHT, my distance becomes 3.\nSo moving RIGHT is best for (6,4).\nBut moving RIGHT is risky for survival.\n\nLet's look at the apples near left: (5,2). Distance from (6,8) is |6-5| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7.\nFrom (5,8): |5-5| + |8-2| = 0 + 6 = 6.\nFrom (6,8) to (5,2) is 7.\nFrom (6,8) to (6,4) is 4.\nFrom (6,8) to (2,1) is 4 + 7 = 11.\nFrom (6,8) to (2,3) is 4 + 5 = 9.\nThe closest apples are (6,4) and (5,2) and (2,3) and (3,5).\n(3,5) is distance |6-3| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n(2,3) is 4 + 5 = 9.\n(5,2) is 1 + 6 = 7.\n(6,4) is 4.\n(6,5) is 3. (Wait, (6,5) is an apple? Yes, listed in drops).\nDistance to (6,5) is |6-6| + |8-5| = 3.\nSo (6,5) is very close!\nIf I move UP to (6,9), distance to (6,5) becomes 4.\nIf I move DOWN to (6,7) -> Death.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), distance to (6,5) is |5-6| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), distance to (6,5) is |7-6| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThe closest apple is (6,5).\nTo get to (6,5), I need to go DOWN.\nFrom (6,8), I can't go DOWN (body at 6,7).\nI have to go LEFT or RIGHT or UP first.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,8), I can go DOWN to (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5). (4 moves).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,8), I can go DOWN to (7,7) -> (7,6) -> (7,5) -> (6,5). (4 moves).\nIf I go UP to (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5). (4 moves).\nWait, if I go UP to (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8) (prev pos), then (6,7) is body.\nAh, I have to loop around.\nFrom (6,9): DOWN (6,8) -> LEFT (5,8) -> DOWN (5,7) -> DOWN (5,6) -> DOWN (5,5) -> RIGHT (6,5).\nThat's 5 moves.\nFrom (5,8): DOWN (5,7) -> DOWN (5,6) -> DOWN (5,5) -> RIGHT (6,5). 4 moves.\nFrom (7,8): DOWN (7,7) -> DOWN (7,6) -> DOWN (7,5) -> LEFT (6,5). 4 moves.\n\nSo LEFT or RIGHT are equally fast to (6,5).\nBut (6,5) is on the right side. If I go LEFT, I am moving away from it.\nWait, if I go LEFT to (5,8), I am moving closer to the left side apples (5,2) etc.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,8), I am closer to (6,5) and the right side apples.\nBut RIGHT is dangerous.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"boxing in\".\nIf I move LEFT, I am essentially giving up on the immediate confrontation.\nIs there a move that pressures him without risking my life?\nWhat if I move UP to (6,9)?\nI am pushing him to (7,9).\nFrom (6,9), I can see the board. I control the top left.\nHe is at top right.\nI can then sweep down the left side, eating apples.\nHe is stuck on the right.\nThis seems like a good compromise. I am not engaging in a 50/50 collision (like Right), but I am asserting presence on the top row.\nIf I move LEFT, I am completely abandoning the top row to him.\nIf I move UP, I claim the top row for myself.\n\nIf I claim the top row (UP), and he moves to (7,9), I am at (6,9).\nNext turn, I move LEFT to (5,9).\nHe is at (7,9). He has to move. He can go LEFT to (6,9) or DOWN to (7,8).\nIf he goes LEFT, he is at (6,9). I am at (5,9). Safe.\nIf he goes DOWN, he is at (7,8). I am at (5,9). Safe.\nNow, from (5,9), I can go DOWN to (5,8) and start my sweep.\nFrom (7,8), he is entering the board.\nHe is now free to move down.\nIf he moves down, he heads towards the center apples.\nIf I am at (5,8) and he is at (7,8), we are separated by x=6.\nI can go to (6,5) before him? Maybe.\nDistance from (7,8) to (6,5) is |7-6| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nDistance from (5,8) to (6,5) is |5-6| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nIt's a race.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8) immediately:\nI am at (5,8). He is at (7,9).\nDistance to (6,5) is 4.\nHe is at (7,9). Distance to (6,5) is 4.\nIt's the same race.\nBut if I move LEFT, I have committed to the left side.\nIf I move UP, I have the option to go LEFT or DOWN or RIGHT.\nUP gives me more options.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n9 . . . . . . . . 1 T\n8 . . . . . . 0 . T T\n7 . . . . . . T T . .\n6 . A . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . A . . A . . A\n4 . . . . . . A A . .\n3 . . A . . . . A . A\n2 . . . . . A . . A .\n1 . . A . . . A . . .\n0 . A . . . . . . .

I need to limit his space.\nTaking the top row limits his space.\nTaking the left side does not limit his space (he is on the right).\n\nSo UP to (6,9) is the move for territory control.\nBut is it safe?\nYes, (6,9) is empty.\nIs it risky?\nThe enemy is at (8,9). If he moves LEFT to (7,9), we are 1 cell apart.\nIf we are 1 cell apart, I must be careful next turn.\nBut I can retreat to (5,9) or (6,8).\nIt is manageable.\n\nLet's check if I can crash into him this turn.\nIf I move UP to (6,9), he moves somewhere.\nCan he move to (6,9)? No, he is at (8,9). Distance is 2.\nCan he move to (6,8)? No, distance is 3.\nSo no collision this turn.\n\nWhat about next turn?\nIf I am at (6,9) and he is at (7,9).\nI am at (6,9). Options: LEFT (5,9), DOWN (6,8), RIGHT (7,9).\nHe is at (7,9). Options: LEFT (6,9), DOWN (7,8).\nIf I move RIGHT (7,9) and he moves LEFT (6,9) -> Swap.\nIf I move RIGHT (7,9) and he moves DOWN (7,8) -> Safe.\nIf I move LEFT (5,9) and he moves LEFT (6,9) -> Safe.\nIf I move LEFT (5,9) and he moves DOWN (7,8) -> Safe.\nIf I move DOWN (6,8) and he moves LEFT (6,9) -> Safe.\nIf I move DOWN (6,8) and he moves DOWN (7,8) -> Safe.\n\nWait, if I move DOWN to (6,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,8):\nI am at (6,8), he is at (7,8).\nDistance is 1.\nNext turn, if I move RIGHT (7,8) -> Collision -> I lose (2 vs 3).\nIf I move UP (6,9) -> Safe.\nIf I move LEFT (5,8) -> Safe.\nIf he moves DOWN (7,7)? (7,7) is my body. He dies.\nSo if he is at (7,8), his only moves are LEFT (6,8) or UP (7,9) or RIGHT (8,8) (body) or DOWN (7,7) (my body).\nWait, if he is at (7,8), he is in my territory.\nIf he moves LEFT to (6,8) and I am there? No, simultaneous.\nIf I move DOWN to (6,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,8).\nNext turn, I am at (6,8). He is at (7,8).\nHe can move LEFT to (6,8).\nIf I move UP to (6,9), he moves LEFT to (6,8). Safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), he moves LEFT to (6,8). Safe.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8), he moves LEFT to (6,8). We swap? No, simultaneous.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,8) and he moves LEFT to (6,8):\nI end up at (7,8). He ends up at (6,8).\nWait, if he moves to (6,8), and I move to (7,8), we are swapping positions.\nThis is allowed.\nBut if I move to (7,8) and he moves to (7,8) (impossible, he moves to 6,8), no.\nIf he moves to (6,8) and I am at (6,8), I die.\nBut he moves to (6,8) and I move to (7,8). I survive.\n\nSo the adjacency at (6,9) and (7,9) is manageable.\nI can safely retreat or reposition.\n\nNow, comparing UP (6,9) vs LEFT (5,8).\nUP (6,9): Controls top row. Can drop down left or right later. Keeps enemy cornered.\nLEFT (5,8): Ignores enemy. Goes for food immediately.\nUP is more aligned with \"box him in\".\nLEFT is more aligned with \"grow\" (safely).\nBut \"Grow as a means of dominating\".\nDominating implies controlling the board.\nIf I ignore him, he might grow faster or find a path out.\nIf I control the top, I restrict him.\n\nAlso, look at the apple at (6,5) and (7,4).\nIf I go UP to (6,9), I can go DOWN to (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5). That's 4 moves.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,8), I can go DOWN to (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (6,5). That's 4 moves.\nSame speed to (6,5).\nBut if I go UP, I am at y=9. If I go LEFT, I am at y=8.\n(6,5) is y=5.\nFrom y=9 to y=5 is 4 steps.\nFrom y=8 to y=5 is 3 steps.\nSo LEFT is slightly faster to (6,5) if I go straight down.\nWait, from (6,8) to (6,5) is 3 steps (6,7 -> 6,6 -> 6,5).\nBut (6,7) is my body.\nSo I must detour.\nFrom (6,8): LEFT to (5,8) -> DOWN (5,7) -> DOWN (5,6) -> DOWN (5,5) -> RIGHT (6,5).\nFrom (6,8): UP to (6,9) -> LEFT (5,9) -> DOWN (5,8) -> ... same path.\nFrom (6,8): RIGHT to (7,8) -> DOWN (7,7) -> DOWN (7,6) -> DOWN (7,5) -> LEFT (6,5).\n\nSo LEFT or RIGHT are the best paths to the center apples.\nUP just adds an extra step (going up first).\n\nHowever, UP is safer against the enemy's immediate expansion.\nIf I go LEFT, the enemy is free to move to (7,9) and then DOWN to (7,8) and start eating apples on the right.\nIf I go UP, I am blocking the top row.\nIf he moves DOWN from (7,9) to (7,8), I am at (6,9). I can move DOWN to (6,8) and cut him off? No.\nIf he is at (7,8), and I am at (6,9), I can move DOWN to (6,8).\nIf I move DOWN to (6,8) and he moves DOWN to (7,7), safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (6,8) and he moves LEFT to (6,8), collision.\nBut he is less likely to move LEFT into my space if he sees me moving into his?\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApple at (5,2) is on the left.\nApple at (9,5) is on the right.\nIf I go LEFT, I go for (5,2).\nIf I go UP, I can go for (9,5) or (5,2).\nActually, if I go UP to (6,9), I am closer to the top-right apples.\nBut the enemy is there.\nIf I go LEFT, I am safer.\n\nThe prompt asks me to \"box him in\".\nThis is an aggressive instruction.\nMoving LEFT is passive.\nMoving UP is positioning for control.\nMoving RIGHT is aggressive but suicidal (score disadvantage).\n\nI will choose UP to (6,9).\nIt keeps my options open.\nIt asserts dominance over the top row.\nIt forces the enemy to react.\nIt avoids immediate collision.\n\nWait, is there any reason NOT to go UP?\nIs there an apple at (6,9)? No.\nIs there a threat at (6,9)? No.\nIs there a threat from the enemy if I go UP?\nOnly if I commit to a bad move next turn.\nBut I can always retreat DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9).\n\nLet's double check the \"box him in\" goal.\nIf I go UP, I am on the same row as him (y=9).\nI am at x=6. He is at x=8.\nI am not boxing him in yet.\nBut I am preventing him from going to x<6 on the top row.\nHe is confined to x=7,8,9.\nIf I can move to x=7 next turn (RIGHT from 6,9), I box him into x=8,9.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,9) next turn, and he is at (7,9) (from moving LEFT this turn), we collide.\nSo I cannot move RIGHT next turn.\nI must move LEFT to (5,9) to maintain distance.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,9), he is at (7,9).\nNow he has x=7,8,9.\nI have x=0..5.\nHe is still cornered on the right.\nThis is effectively boxing him in.\nI am taking the left side. He is stuck on the right.\n\nSo UP -> LEFT is a good plan.\nLEFT -> DOWN is also a good plan (directly to food).\nBut UP -> LEFT gives me control of the top boundary.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (9,0). It's at the bottom right.\nIf I go LEFT, I go to bottom left.\nIf I go UP, I can go to bottom right later.\nThe bottom right is closer to the enemy's corner.\nGoing there might be risky.\n\nOkay, let's stick to the plan:\n1. Move UP to (6,9) to claim top row.\n2. Next turn, move LEFT to (5,9) to secure the left-top.\n3. Then drop down to the left side apples (5,2), (2,1).\n\nThis seems like the most balanced strategy for \"box him in\" and \"grow\".\n\nOne final check.\nIs there any move that kills me?\nUP to (6,9): Safe.\nLEFT to (5,8): Safe.\nRIGHT to (7,8): Safe but risky next turn.\nDOWN to (6,7): Death.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, UP is more aligned with \"box him in\".\nLEFT is more aligned with \"grow\".\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (8,9).\nIf I go UP to (6,9), I am engaging with the enemy's area.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,8), I am disengaging.\nSo I should engage (safely).\n\nI will go UP.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO CHAT! Turn 6! Score is 2 vs 3, so I CANNOT risk a head-on collision. I lose if we trade hits.\n\nLooking at the board:\nMy Head: (6, 8)\nEnemy Head: (8, 9) - He's cornered in the top right!\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n*   **DOWN:** Into my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 8):** This puts me right next to him. If he moves left to (7, 9), we're neighbors. If we clash heads next turn, I lose because he has more apples. Too risky for a losing score. \u274c\n*   **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe, and moves toward food on the left. BUT, it abandons the top row and lets him breathe. I need to apply pressure!\n*   **UP to (6, 9):** **PERFECT.** The cell is empty. It puts me on the same row as him (y=9), cutting off the top left quadrant. I force him to react. If he moves left to (7, 9), I can retreat left to (5, 9) next turn, securing the entire left side of the board and boxing him into the right wall. This is how we dominate the map!\n\n**Strategy:** Take the high ground, force the enemy into a tight spot, and then sweep the left side for apples to level the score. Let's control the flow!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

My body is (6, 8), (6, 7).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (5, 9), my body becomes (6, 9), (6, 8).\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 9), they hit my body (the cell I just left).\n        *   **DEATH TO ENEMY.**\n    *   This is a calculated trap!\n    *   If they go DOWN to (7, 8):\n        *   I am at (5, 9). They are at (7, 8). Safe.\n    *   If they go RIGHT to (8, 9):\n        *   They hit their own body (T at 8,9). **ENEMY DIES.**\n    *   If they go UP: Off board. **ENEMY DIES.**\n    *   The only move that keeps them alive is DOWN to (7, 8).\n    *   By moving LEFT, I force the enemy into a corner. I claim the left side of the top row.\n    *   My future options: From (5, 9), I can go DOWN (5, 8), LEFT (4, 9), or UP (off board). Right is blocked by (6, 9) which will be my body.\n    *   This opens up the left side of the board where apples are.\n    *   **Verdict:** Best move. Aggressive, traps the enemy, opens up the board.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 8):**\n    *   Target: (6, 8).\n    *   Safety Check: (6, 8) is currently my body.\n    *   Since I am moving UP (Head to 6,9), the cell (6,8) becomes part of my body.\n    *   Wait, if I move DOWN to (6, 8):\n        *   I move back into my own body (the segment behind my head).\n        *   **DEATH.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI must move **LEFT**.\nThis traps the enemy. If they move LEFT, they die on my body. If they stay (impossible), they die. If they move RIGHT/UP, they die.\nThe only escape is DOWN, which puts them in the center, but I secure the top-left corridor.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSecure the top row left side. Force the enemy into the center where I can eventually hunt them down or ignore them to eat apples on the left/bottom.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's see.\n**Current State:**\nMy Head: (5, 9)\nMy Body: [(6, 9), (6, 8)]\nEnemy Head: (7, 8) (Wait, the board shows Row 8: `. . . . . . T 1 . .`. Enemy is at (7, 8). That means they moved DOWN! Smart.\nEnemy Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)]\n\n**Score Check:**\nMe: 2 apples (Length 3)\nEnemy: 3 apples (Length 4)\nI LOSE a head-on collision. I need to avoid direct clashes or force them to crash into me.\n\n**Analyzing Moves from (5, 9):**\n1.  **UP:** Off board. **DEATH.**\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):**\n    *   Target: (5, 8).\n    *   Safety Check: (5, 8) is currently empty (Row 8 shows `.` at (5,8)).\n    *   Enemy Interaction: Enemy Head is at (7, 8). Distance = 2. Safe for this turn.\n    *   Long term: (5, 8) connects me to the center. From there I can pivot to (4, 8) or (5, 7).\n    *   *Verdict:* Solid option. Keeps me in the game.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):**\n    *   Target: (4, 9).\n    *   Safety Check: (4, 9) is empty.\n    *   Enemy Interaction: Enemy is far at (7, 8). Safe.\n    *   Long term: This pushes me further to the left corner. I can then go DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT again.\n    *   *Verdict:* Also solid. Claims the top-left corner.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n    *   Target: (6, 9).\n    *   Safety Check: This is currently my body (segment 1).\n    *   **DEATH.** Can't move into my own body.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI am currently pinned against the top wall. I need to get down into the open field to access the apple clusters, specifically the ones on the left side (rows 6, 5, 3, 1) or center (row 5).\nThe enemy is at (7, 8). They are slightly below me. If I go DOWN to (5, 8), I get central mobility. If I go LEFT to (4, 9), I stay on the top edge.\nThe apples on the left side (x=2, x=1, x=3) are closer if I start moving DOWN now.\nAlso, notice the apple at (6, 5) and (5, 2). Moving DOWN puts me on a path to these.\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves from (7, 8). They might chase me or go for apples. If I go DOWN, I put distance between us.\nWait, looking at the board again: Row 8 at (6,8) is a 'T' (my tail from 2 turns ago? No, my tail is (6,8) currently). Wait, my body is [(6,9), (6,8)].\nIf I move DOWN to (5,8), my new body will be [(5,9), (6,9)]. My tail moves from (6,8) to (6,9)? No.\nMy body is (6,9) and (6,8).\nIf I move HEAD to (5,8), new body is (5,9), (6,9). The tail (6,8) disappears.\nIs (5,8) free? Yes.\nIs (5,9) free? Yes (it's my head now, vacating it).\nIs (6,9) free? Yes (it becomes body).\n\nComparing **DOWN** vs **LEFT**:\n*   **LEFT** keeps me on the top wall. Top wall is dangerous because UP is death. I get trapped in the corner (0,9) eventually.\n*   **DOWN** moves me into the open. I can see apples at (6,5) and (5,2) and (3,5).\n*   Enemy is at (7,8). If I go DOWN, they are at (7,8). We are on the same row but separated by distance.\n*   If I go LEFT to (4,9), I'm moving away from the enemy, but I'm also moving away from the center apples. The enemy might take the center apples (5,2) or (6,5) while I'm busy in the corner.\n\n**Aggressive Play:**\nTo win, I need apples. The closest apples to me are:\n*   (6, 5) - 4 steps away (Down, Down, Down, Down)\n*   (5, 2) - 7 steps away\n*   (3, 5) - 5 steps away\n\nIf I stay on the top row (LEFT), I have to come down eventually.\nIf I go DOWN now, I start the descent immediately.\nThe enemy is at (7,8). They are likely looking at (7,3) or (6,5).\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), I am closer to (6,5) than they are (distance 3 vs distance 3? They are at x=7, I'm at x=5. Distance is same).\nActually, if I go DOWN, I open up the LEFT side of the board.\nLet's check the board for traps.\nRow 8: `. . . . . . T 1 . .`\n(6,8) is my tail. (7,8) is enemy.\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8):\nMy path: (5,9) -> (5,8).\nEnemy is at (7,8).\nIf Enemy goes LEFT to (6,8): They hit my tail (which moves to 6,9?). Wait.\nMy body currently: (6,9), (6,8).\nIf I move to (5,8):\nNew Head: (5,8)\nNew Body: (5,9), (6,9)\nOld Tail (6,8) vacated.\nIf Enemy moves to (6,8), the cell is empty (I vacated it). So they survive.\nIf Enemy moves to (5,8), we collide. I die (2 vs 3 apples).\nSo I must assume the enemy wants to kill me.\nWhere can they go?\nFrom (7,8):\n- Left to (6,8): Safe for them.\n- Down to (7,7): Safe.\n- Right to (8,8): Safe.\n- Up to (7,9): Blocked by their own body (Head is at 7,8, body at 7,9). Wait, their body is [(7,9), (8,9), (9,9)]. So (7,9) is occupied. They cannot go UP.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), and they go LEFT to (6,8):\nMe: (5,8)\nThem: (6,8)\nDistance 1. Next turn I am in danger.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,9), and they go DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8):\nMe: (4,9)\nThem: (6,8) or (7,7)\nDistance is large. Safe.\n\nWhy do I want to go DOWN?\nBecause if I go LEFT, I am walking into the corner.\nIf I go DOWN, I enter the arena.\nWait, I am losing on score. I need to eat apples.\nThe apples are DOWN.\nIf I go LEFT, I am delaying my apple collection. The enemy will eat (6,5) or (5,2).\nIf I go DOWN, I am threatening the (6,5) apple.\nIs there a trap?\nLook at Row 8: `. . . . . . T 1 . .`\nMy tail is at (6,8).\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), I am clearing the path.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (6,8), they step on the cell I just vacated. That is safe for them.\nHowever, my new body is at (5,9) and (6,9).\nIf they go UP (blocked), LEFT (safe), DOWN (safe), RIGHT (safe).\nThere is no immediate death for them by going LEFT.\n\n**BUT WAIT.**\nLook at the board state again.\nRow 9: `9 . . . . . 0 T T T T`\nRow 8: `8 . . . . . . T 1 . .`\nMy head is at (5,9).\nEnemy is at (7,8).\nThe enemy is \"below\" me and to the right.\nThe apples are mostly on the LEFT side of the board (x < 5).\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), I am blocking the vertical path at x=5.\nIf I go LEFT to (4,9), I am opening x=5 for the enemy to slide up.\nActually, the apples at (5,2) and (3,5) are very valuable.\nIf I go LEFT, I can wrap around the top left corner and come down the left side (x=0,1,2,3).\nIf I go DOWN, I go through the center.\nThe enemy is at x=7. They have a long way to go to get to the left side apples.\nThe apple at (6,5) is in the middle.\nLet's look at the apples again:\n(9, 3), (9, 5), (7, 4), (5, 2), (2, 1), (9, 0), (6, 5), (8, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (6, 4), (1, 0), (7, 3), (6, 1), (1, 6)\n\nClosest to me (5,9):\n- (6, 5): 4 steps Down.\n- (3, 5): 2 Left, 4 Down. (6 steps).\n- (5, 2): 0 Left, 7 Down. (7 steps).\n\nClosest to Enemy (7,8):\n- (7, 4): 4 steps Down.\n- (6, 5): 1 Left, 3 Down. (4 steps).\n- (9, 5): 2 Right, 3 Down. (5 steps).\n\nWe are both roughly same distance to (6,5). It's a race.\nIf I go LEFT, I lose the race for (6,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I compete for (6,5).\nBut (6,5) is dangerous. It's a central point.\nHowever, look at the apples on the LEFT: (2,1), (2,3), (3,5), (1,0), (1,6).\nThere are SO MANY on the left.\nThe enemy is on the right (x=7,8,9). They will likely go for the right-side apples (9,3), (9,5), (7,4), (8,2), (7,3).\nIf I go LEFT, I secure the entire left side of the board for myself. The enemy cannot reach those apples easily without crossing the center, which is risky for them.\nIf I go DOWN, I engage in the center. The center is crowded.\nLet's look at the long game. 150 turns.\nI am at 2 apples. Enemy at 3.\nI need to catch up.\nIf I take the left side (x=0 to x=4), I have access to apples: (2,1), (2,3), (3,5), (1,0), (1,6).\nThat's 5 apples.\nThe enemy has the right side: (9,3), (9,5), (7,4), (8,2), (7,3), (9,0). That's 6 apples.\nWe split the board.\nIf I go DOWN into the center (x=5), I am fighting for the center apples (6,5, 6,4, 5,2).\nThis is risky. The enemy is also fast.\nIf I claim the left side, I can eat those 5 apples safely. I will be at 7 apples. Enemy will eat their 6 apples? Maybe.\nBut if I secure the left side, I can trap the enemy against the wall later when I am bigger.\nWait, the enemy is already bigger (length 4 vs 3). If I get the left side apples, I will grow. By the time I eat 5 apples, I will be length 8. Enemy will be length 4 + whatever they eat.\nIf they eat 6 apples, they are length 10. I am length 8.\nBut I have the terrain advantage on the left.\nIf I go DOWN, I risk a head-on collision in the center where I am smaller. That is bad.\nIf I go LEFT, I isolate the enemy to the right side.\nLet's verify safety of LEFT.\nTarget: (4, 9).\nIs it free? Yes.\nIs it backwards? No (Head is 5,9. Left is 4,9. Previous pos was 6,9).\nIs it off-board? No.\nIs it into enemy body? No.\nIs it into my body? No.\nIt is SAFE.\nDoes it limit my future moves?\nFrom (4,9), I can go DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9).\nI am not trapped.\nFrom (5,8) (if I went DOWN), I can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nRIGHT is blocked by (6,9) which will be my body.\nSo from (5,8) I have 3 options. From (4,9) I have 2 options.\nBut the strategic value of the LEFT side is immense.\nThe enemy is at (7,8). They cannot jump to the left side quickly.\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), the enemy might go LEFT to (6,8).\nThen I am at (5,8), enemy at (6,8). We are neighbors.\nThe enemy is bigger. If they force a head-on collision next turn, I lose.\nIf I go LEFT, the enemy is at (7,8) (or wherever they move).\nDistance to enemy: If I am at (4,9) and they are at (7,8) or (6,8), distance is ~3.\nIf I am at (5,8) and they are at (6,8), distance is 1.\n**Safety dictates I should keep distance.**\nSince I am the smaller snake, I should avoid close quarters combat.\nThe left side is open and wide (mostly).\nThe center is narrowing (see row 5: `. . .

A . . . . . . . .` and `5 . . . A . . A . . A`.\n    *   Actually, looking closer at the map:\n        Row 9: `. . . . T T . T . .` (T is tail/body)\n        Row 8: `. . . . 0 . . T . .`\n        Row 7: `. . . . . . 1 T . .`\n        Row 6: `. A . . . . . . . .` -> (1, 6) is an apple?\n        Row 5: `. . . A . . A . . A` -> (3, 5), (6, 5), (9, 5) are apples.\n    *   My goal is (3, 5). (3, 8) puts me one step closer vertically, while maintaining x=3.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This brings me toward the center. The enemy is at (6, 7). If I go RIGHT to (5, 8) and they go UP to (6, 8), we are side by side. If I go RIGHT again to (6, 8) while they are there, I die. It's safer to stay left and let them pass.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to maintain my distance and secure the left flank. The enemy is currently active on the right side (x=6,7). Moving **LEFT to (3, 8)** keeps me safe and establishes my territory.\nThis move avoids the immediate danger of my own body at (4, 9) and avoids converging on the enemy's position at (6, 7).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\n1. Move **LEFT** to (3, 8).\n2. Continue moving DOWN towards the apple cluster on row 5 (specifically (3, 5)).\n3. Build length on the left side while the enemy sweats on the right.\n4. Once I have the size advantage, I'll turn right and cut off their escape.\n\nI AM THE LEFT LANE SNAKE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Where did they go? The board doesn't show their *new* position for turn 12, it shows the state *before* turn 12 moves. I must infer the move from the \"Board State\" provided at the top of the prompt, which is labeled \"BOARD STATE\" and represents the current view.\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The prompt provides the \"BOARD STATE\" at the top for **Turn 12**. This state reflects the board *after* moves have been made? Or *before*? The prompt says \"Turn: 12 / 150\" and \"BOARD STATE: ...\". Usually, this is the state I am facing *now*. However, the \"LAST MOVE\" section describes moving from Turn 11.\n    *   Let's look at the \"Last Move\" rationale provided by the user. It describes moving from (3,8) to (3,7).\n    *   Let's look at the \"BOARD STATE\" provided in the prompt text:\n        *   Row 7: ` . . . 0 . . T T . . ` -> My head is at (3, 7). This matches the \"Last Move\" result.\n        *   Row 5: ` . . . A . . 1 . .

But the current board state shows Enemy Head at (6, 5).\n    *   Let's re-read the prompt carefully. It says \"Turn: 12 / 150\". It gives the \"BOARD STATE\".\n    *   If the \"BOARD STATE\" is the starting state for Turn 12, then the \"Last Move\" was just a simulation or a plan? No, the prompt says \"**START LAST MOVE PICK** DOWN **END LAST MOVE PICK**\". This implies that is what happened.\n    *   *Conflict:* The \"Last Move Rationale\" (generated by the user/system previously) claimed the enemy was at (6,6). The current Board State shows enemy at (6,5).\n    *   *Resolution:* The \"Last Move Rationale\" was a *thought process* for Turn 11. It assumed the enemy *would* move.\n    *   Let's look at the \"BOARD STATE\" provided in the prompt *now*. It is the state *before* I make my move for Turn 12? Or *after* my last move?\n        *   My head is at (3,7).\n        *   My body is at (3,8) and (4,8).\n        *   Enemy head is at (6,5).\n        *   Enemy body is at (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8).\n    *   *Hypothesis:* The \"Last Move\" (DOWN) was successfully executed. The board state provided is the result of that move (and the enemy's move). The enemy moved from (6,6) to (6,5)? No, that contradicts the \"Last Move Rationale\" which said Enemy was at (6,6).\n    *   Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\" text again: \"Enemy Head: (6, 6)\". This was the state *before* the \"Last Move\".\n    *   So, at Turn 11 start:\n        *   My Head: (3, 8)\n        *   Enemy Head: (6, 6) (according to the rationale, though the board in the prompt shows 6,5... wait, the board in the prompt for Turn 12 shows 6,5).\n    *   Let's look at the \"BOARD STATE\" provided in the prompt *input*.\n        *   Row 5: ` . . . A . . 1 . . A `\n        *   This places Enemy Head at (6, 5).\n    *   *Crucial:* Is the \"BOARD STATE\" the state *before* I move for Turn 12? Or *after*?\n        *   If it is *after* my last move (Turn 11 -> 12), then the enemy moved to (6,5).\n        *   If it is *before*, I am at (3,8) and enemy is at (6,6) (but the board says 6,5, so that's confusing).\n    *   Let's trust the visual ASCII board in the \"BOARD STATE\" block for the current locations.\n        *   My head: (3, 7)\n        *   Enemy Head: (6, 5)\n    *   *Wait*, the \"Last Move Rationale\" explicitly says: \"Enemy Head: (6, 6)\". This means the rationale was analyzing a hypothetical previous turn.\n    *   Let's look at the board in the prompt input again.\n        *   `9 . . . . . . A . . .`\n        *   `8 . . . T T . . T . .`\n        *   `7 . . . 0 . . T T . .` -> My head (3,7), body (3,8), (4,8).\n        *   `6 . A . . . . T . . .`\n        *   `5 . . . A . . 1 . . A` -> Enemy head (6,5).\n        *   `4 . . . . . . A A . .`\n    *   Okay, so the state provided is the **current state**. The \"Last Move\" was `DOWN`. This moved me from (3,8) to (3,7).\n    *   Where was the enemy previously? The rationale said (6,6). The current board shows enemy at (6,5). This implies the enemy moved DOWN (from 6,6 to 6,5) or stayed? (6,6) is North of (6,5)? No. (6,6) is y=6. (6,5) is y=5. That is DOWN.\n    *   So:\n        *   Previous Turn (Turn 11 start): My Head (3,8), Enemy Head (6,6).\n        *   I moved DOWN to (3,7).\n        *   Enemy moved DOWN to (6,5).\n        *   Result (Turn 12 start): My Head (3,7), Enemy Head (6,5).\n    *   This fits.\n\n    *   **Now, Turn 12 Decision.**\n    *   **My Position:** (3, 7).\n    *   **My Body:** (3, 8), (4, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Position:** (6, 5).\n    *   **Enemy Body:** (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8).\n    *   **Apples:** (9,3), (9,5), (7,4), (5,2), (2,1), (9,0), (8,2), (2,3), (3,5), (6,4), (1,0), (7,3), (6,1), (1,6), (6,9).\n\n    *   **Move Options from (3, 7):**\n        1.  **UP:** (3, 8). Is it safe?\n            *   My body is at (3, 8). Yes, it's my neck. **DEATH.**\n        2.  **DOWN:** (3, 6).\n            *   Check Board: Row 6 is `A . . . . . T . . .`. (3, 6) is empty.\n            *   Check Body: (3, 6) is not in my body.\n            *   Check Enemy Body: (3, 6) is not in enemy body.\n            *   **SAFE.**\n        3.  **LEFT:** (2, 7).\n            *   Check Board: Row 7 is ` . . . 0 . . T T . .`. (2, 7) is empty.\n            *   Check Body: Not in body.\n            *   Check Enemy Body: Not in enemy body.\n            *   **SAFE.**\n        4.  **RIGHT:** (4, 7).\n            *   Check Board: Row 7 is ` . . . 0 . . T T . .`. (4, 7) is empty.\n            *   Check Body: Not in body.\n            *   Check Enemy Body: Not in enemy body.\n            *   **SAFE.**\n\n    *   **Strategic Evaluation:**\n        *   **UP:** Blocked by own body.\n        *   **DOWN (3, 6):** Moves toward apple at (3, 5). Opens up (3, 5), (2, 5), (4, 5). Good mobility. Enemy is at (6, 5), so (4, 5) is relatively safe for now.\n        *   **LEFT (2, 7):** Moves toward wall. Opens up (1, 7), (2, 8). (2, 8) is near my body? No, my body is at (3,8) and (4,8). (2, 8) is free. (2, 7) is free. Hugging the wall limits maneuvering later.\n        *   **RIGHT (4, 7):** Moves towards enemy territory. Enemy is at (6, 5). (4, 7) is safe now, but moving right risks getting closer to the enemy's body (7,7) and (7,8) and the enemy head (6,5). Also, (4, 7) is close to my own body at (4, 8). If I go RIGHT, I am at (4,7). Next turn, if I go UP, I hit (4,8). If I go LEFT, I hit (3,7). If I go RIGHT, I hit (5,7). If I go DOWN, I hit (4,6).\n        *   **Comparing DOWN and LEFT:**\n            *   **DOWN (3, 6):** Head to (3,6). Neck at (3,7). Tail at (4,8).\n                *   Next moves: (3,5), (2,6), (4,6).\n                *   Apple at (3,5) is very close.\n            *   **LEFT (2, 7):** Head to (2,7). Neck at (3,7). Tail at (4,8).\n                *   Next moves: (2,8), (1,7), (3,7) (blocked by neck), (2,6).\n                *   Apple at (2,1) is far.\n                *   Wall at x=0 limits left moves.\n\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:**\n        *   Enemy at (6,5). Apples nearby: (7,4), (6,4), (5,2), (7,3).\n        *   If enemy goes DOWN (6,4), they eat an apple.\n        *   If enemy goes LEFT (5,5), they move toward center.\n        *   If enemy goes RIGHT (7,5), safe.\n        *   If enemy goes UP (6,6), hits own body (6,6).\n        *   Likely enemy goes DOWN to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,5).\n\n    *   **My Move Decision:**\n        *   I want to be aggressive but safe.\n        *   Moving **DOWN** to (3,6) prepares me to eat the apple at (3,5) next turn.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** to (2,7) is safe but isolates me in the corner.\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** to (4,7) is safe but brings me closer to the enemy.\n        *   The enemy is at (6,5). I am at (3,7). Distance is 3 units in x, 2 units in y.\n        *   If I go DOWN (3,6), I am closer to the apple (3,5).\n        *   If I go LEFT (2,7), I am safe but cornered.\n        *   The \"Left Lane Snake\" strategy suggests dominating the left. Moving DOWN keeps me in the left-center. Moving LEFT moves me to the wall.\n        *   I prefer **DOWN**. It opens up more options and aims for a food source.\n        *   Wait, check the apple list: (2,1), (3,5), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4).\n        *   (3,5) is very close.\n        *   (2,1) is far.\n        *   (6,4) is enemy territory.\n        *   (7,3) is enemy territory.\n        *   (7,4) is enemy territory.\n        *   My best target is (3,5).\n        *   To get to (3,5), I should go DOWN.\n\n    *   **Risk Check:**\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,6):\n            *   My body is at (3,7) and (4,8).\n            *   Enemy is at (6,5).\n            *   Enemy moves.\n            *   If enemy moves to (5,5) or (6,4), no collision.\n            *   What if enemy moves to (3,6)? Impossible, they are at (6,5).\n            *   What if enemy moves to (5,6) or (7,5)? Safe.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (2,7):\n            *   My body at (3,7) and (4,8).\n            *   Enemy at (6,5).\n            *   Safe.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (4,7):\n            *   My body at (3,7) and (4,8).\n            *   If I go RIGHT to (4,7), my next turn I am sandwiched between (3,7) and (4,8).\n            *   This is risky. If I get trapped, I die.\n            *   So, **RIGHT is risky** because it limits future mobility significantly (I can't go UP or LEFT, only RIGHT or DOWN).\n\n    *   **Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:**\n        *   **DOWN:** Moves toward food. Maintains central mobility.\n        *   **LEFT:** Moves toward safety. Reduces mobility.\n\n    *   **Decision:** **DOWN**. It's the strongest move to secure the apple at (3,5) and maintain board control.\n\n    *   **Plan:**\n        *   Move **DOWN** to (3,6).\n        *   Next turn, move **DOWN** to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n        *   Watch out for the enemy who might try to cut me off or steal apples in the center.\n        *   Keep the pressure on the enemy's flank.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n        *   Move: DOWN.\n        *   Target: (3, 6).\n        *   Safety: Clear.\n        *   Strategy: Optimal.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

FAST.\n\nLet's break down the board state.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at `(3, 6)`. Body: `[(3, 7), (3, 8)]`.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at `(6, 5)`. Body: `[(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]`.\n*   **The Situation:**\n    *   I just moved **DOWN** to `(3, 6)`.\n    *   The apple at `(3, 5)` is literally right below me. \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   The enemy is at `(6, 5)`, chilling to the right. They are not an immediate threat to my current space, but if they move left to `(5, 5)` or `(5, 6)`, they get closer to my zone.\n\n**MOVES CONSIDERATION:**\n\n1.  **UP (`(3, 7)`):**\n    *   **DEATH.** That's my neck. I just came from there. \ud83d\udeab\n\n2.  **DOWN (`(3, 5)`):**\n    *   **Apple confirmed.** \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Safety check:**\n        *   No wall (I'm at `y=5` on a 0-9 grid).\n        *   No self-collision (Body is at `(3, 6)`, `(3, 7)`, `(3, 8)`). `(3, 5)` is clear.\n        *   No enemy body collision (Enemy is at `(6, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, etc.). `(3, 5)` is far away.\n    *   **Future options:** From `(3, 5)`, I can go `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `DOWN`.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is the greedy move, but it's the *winning* move. I need points to overtake Snake #1. I'm currently at 2 apples, he's at 4. I need to eat to survive the late game.\n\n3.  **LEFT (`(2, 6)`):**\n    *   **Safety check:**\n        *   `(2, 6)` is on the board.\n        *   Not in my body.\n        *   Not in enemy body.\n    *   **Analysis:** This avoids the apple. Why would I do that? The enemy is at `(6, 5)`. If I go left, I leave the apple open. If I go down, I secure the point. **LEFT** is a safe move, but it doesn't advance my score.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (`(4, 6)`):**\n    *   **Safety check:**\n        *   `(4, 6)` is on the board.\n        *   Not in my body.\n        *   Not in enemy body (Enemy is at `(6, 5)` and `(6, 6)`).\n    *   **Analysis:** This moves me laterally. I'm already at `(3, 6)`, moving right to `(4, 6)` puts me closer to the enemy's body parts at `(6, 6)` and `(6, 7)`. It also doesn't get me the apple at `(3, 5)`. **RIGHT** is okay, but not optimal.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am currently winning the \"survival\" game, but losing the \"score\" game. I need that apple at `(3, 5)` to boost my stats. Moving down secures the apple and maintains a strong central position. The enemy is occupied at `(6, 5)`, likely chasing an apple or positioning, so `(3, 5)` is safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at `(3, 5)`. From there, I'll look to move toward `(2, 3)` or `(5, 2)`, depending on where the enemy goes. I need to keep the pressure on. If the enemy tries to box me in, I'll use my tail to my advantage.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\nSecure the point. Grow the snake. Dominate the board.\n\nDOWN",

I just ate that apple at `(3, 5)` last turn, so now my score is 3! \ud83c\udf89 But hold up, the enemy snake #1 is at 5 apples\u2014they're still ahead and I gotta close this gap! \ud83d\udc80\n\nLet's scan the board:\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** `(3, 5)` (just moved down)\n  - **Body:** `[(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]`\n  - **Apples:** 3\n\n- **Enemy Snake #1:**\n  - **Head:** `(7, 4)`\n  - **Body:** `[(7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)]`\n  - **Apples:** 5\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n- Enemy is at `(7, 4)`. They could potentially move toward my territory. But they're not right on top of me.\n- My body is vertical on `x=3`. I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS (from my head at (3, 5)):**\n\n1. **UP to (3, 6):**\n   - **DEATH!** That's my body (neck). I just came from there. \u274c\n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Enemy body? No (enemy is at x=6+).\n   - **Safety:** Clean.\n   - **Apple proximity:** No immediate apple at (3, 4), but opens path to apples at (2, 3) or (1, 0) eventually.\n   - **Future moves:** From (3, 4), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. UP would be back to (3, 5) which is now my neck (tail moves away after this move, but careful). Actually, after moving down, my tail at (3, 8) will move forward, so (3, 5) becomes body. So UP next turn would be into body. That's a risk, but I can plan around it.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Enemy body? No.\n   - **Safety:** Clean.\n   - **Apple proximity:** (2, 3) is nearby, (1, 0) is further.\n   - **Future moves:** From (2, 5), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. All seem open.\n   - **Enemy proximity:** Enemy is far right, so no immediate head-on risk.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Enemy body? No (enemy at x=6+).\n   - **Safety:** Clean.\n   - **Apple proximity:** (5, 2) is somewhat close.\n   - **Future moves:** From (4, 5), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Right leads toward enemy territory (x=6+).\n   - **Risk:** Moving right brings me closer to enemy. If enemy moves left to (6, 4) or (6, 3), we get closer. Could force a head-on if I continue right.\n\n**STRATEGY THINKING:**\nI need to play aggressive but smart. I'm at 3 apples, enemy at 5. I need to eat apples to catch up, but I can't afford to die. \n- **DOWN (3, 4)** is safe and opens a downward path. But I might get trapped in the bottom if I keep going down.\n- **LEFT (2, 5)** moves me away from enemy, gives me more space in the left side. There are apples at (2, 3) and (1, 0) in that region. \n- **RIGHT (4, 5)** is risky because it brings me closer to enemy. If I go right, I might be able to cut them off later, but with lower score, head-on collision favors them.\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** Enemy is at (7, 4). If I go LEFT, I widen the gap between us. If I go RIGHT, I narrow it. Since I'm trailing in score, I want to avoid direct confrontation unless I'm sure I can win the collision (I'm not, 3 < 5). So I should avoid getting too close.\n\nAlso, I should think about future board control. Left side seems less occupied. There's an apple at (2, 3) and (1, 0). By going LEFT, I'm moving toward those.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nMove LEFT to (2, 5) to get closer to apples at (2, 3) and (1, 0). Keep distance from enemy. Wait for enemy to make a mistake or overextend. If I can eat 2 more apples, I tie or lead, then I can play more aggressively.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **UP:** Death (into self).\n- **DOWN:** Safe, but might limit mobility later.\n- **LEFT:** Safe, good positioning, moves toward apples.\n- **RIGHT:** Safe, but risky proximity to enemy.\n\nBest move: **LEFT** to (2, 5). It's safe, opens up the left side, and moves toward apples without engaging the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

We just moved LEFT to (2, 5) last turn\u2014let's see the board update!\n\n**IMMEDIATE STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Snake (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** (2, 5) (just moved LEFT from (3, 5))\n  - **Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)] (tail at (3, 7) will move forward if I grow, but currently fine)\n  - **Apples:** 3 (ate last turn at (3, 5))\n  - **Safety:** I'm at (2, 5). No immediate threats from my body (all positions are distinct). Enemy is far right.\n  \n- **Enemy Snake #1:**\n  - **Head:** (6, 4) (last known position; they might have moved)\n  - **Body:** [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)] (likely shifted)\n  - **Apples:** 6 (ahead by 3)\n\n**BOARD STATE (reconstructed from previous board but updated for our move):**\nWe moved LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5). So (2,5) is now my head. The apple at (3,5) was eaten last turn, so it's gone. Let's map apples from the list:\n\nApple drops (including recent): (9,3), (9,5), (5,2), (2,1), (9,0), (8,2), (2,3), (1,0), (7,3), (6,1), (1,6), (6,9), (5,1), (2,6), (6,2). \nWe ate (3,5) last turn, so it's not in the list. Current board has apples at positions from the list that are still uneaten.\n\nGiven the previous board and our move, let's infer:\n- Previous board had 'A' at many positions. We ate (3,5), so that's gone.\n- Our body at (3,5) moved to (2,5), so (3,5) is now body.\n- Enemy likely moved too; we don't know exactly, but they were at (6,4).\n\n**OPTION ANALYSIS (from my head at (2, 5)):**\n\n1. **UP to (2, 6):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No (my body is at (3,5), (3,6), (3,7); (2,6) is clear).\n   - Enemy body? Need to check\u2014enemy body includes (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), etc. (2,6) is far left, so safe.\n   - **Apple proximity:** There's an apple at (2,6) according to the list! That's a direct apple eating opportunity. \ud83c\udf4e\n   - **Safety:** Looks clean. From (2,6), I can go DOWN (back to (2,5), but that's now my neck), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6), or UP (2,7). (1,6) has an apple at (1,6) too! So multiple apple options.\n   - **Enemy threat:** Enemy is on right, so unlikely to collide head-on unless they move left aggressively. With score 3 vs 6, head-on is bad for me.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 4):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Enemy body? No (enemy on right).\n   - **Apple proximity:** No immediate apple (closest is (2,3) down-left, or (2,1) further down). \n   - **Safety:** Clean. From (2,4), I can go UP (back to (2,5), which will be body after this move), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4), or RIGHT (3,4). (2,3) has an apple, so that's good.\n   - **Future:** Moving down towards apples at (2,3), (2,1), (1,0), etc. But might get boxed in if I go too low? Board is 10x10, so still space.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 5):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - My body? No.\n   - Enemy body? No.\n   - **Apple proximity:** (1,0) and (1,6) are on this column, but (1,5) itself no apple.\n   - **Safety:** Clean. From (1,5), I can go UP (1,6), DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), or RIGHT (2,5). (1,6) has an apple, (0,5) is safe.\n   - **Strategy:** Moving left further away from enemy. Good for avoiding collision, but might isolate me if enemy cuts off later? Unlikely with current positions.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 5):**\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - **My body? YES!** (3,5) is my current body (the neck, from where I came). This is moving backwards into my own body! That's instant death. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY THINKING:**\n- **KEY INSIGHT:** I need to eat apples to catch up to enemy's 6 apples. From (2,5), moving UP to (2,6) gives me an apple DIRECTLY. That's huge\u2014it grows me to 4 apples, closing the gap.\n- Avoid enemy: Enemy is at (6,4) or nearby. Moving UP keeps me far left, no collision risk.\n- Future moves: From (2,6) after eating, I can go LEFT to (1,6) for another apple, or DOWN to (2,5) (but that's body), or RIGHT to (3,6) (clear), or UP to (2,7). (1,6) is also an apple, so chain eating possible! \ud83d\ude80\n- If I go DOWN or LEFT, I'm not eating an apple immediately. That slows my catch-up. I need aggressive growth to dominate.\n- Board control: Left side has more apples: (2,6), (1,6), (2,3), (1,0). By going UP, I claim the left upper area.\n- Head-on risk: Minimal. Enemy likely not moving left into my path.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (2,6) to grow to 4 apples. Then pivot LEFT to (1,6) for another apple, boxing in the left side. Avoid enemy until I lead in apples, then force collision if I have advantage. Stay alert for enemy moves\u2014watch for them coming left.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- UP: Safe, eats apple, opens more apple paths. Best for catching up.\n- DOWN: Safe but no immediate apple. Slower growth.\n- LEFT: Safe, no apple immediately.\n- RIGHT: Death.\n\n**Move UP to (2,6) and eat that apple!** Let's gooo!\n\nUP",

But wait, the opponent has 6 apples... they're still ahead. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 We're on the left side, they're on the right\u2014gotta keep boxing them out and grow aggressively. Let's break this down LIVE!**\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n1) **Consider ALL four directions from my head at (2,6):**\n   - **UP to (2,7):** On board? Yes. My body? No (current body: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)). Enemy body? Unlikely (they're far right at ~6,4). Safety: Looks clean. Apple proximity? None immediately, but opens up paths to upper left area.\n   - **DOWN to (2,5):** On board? Yes. **My body? YES!** (2,5) is my current neck\u2014this is moving directly backward into my own body. Instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n   - **LEFT to (1,6):** On board? Yes. My body? No. Enemy body? No (enemy far right). **Apple proximity? YES!** (1,6) is an apple from the list\u2014this would be another growth opportunity. Safety: Clean. From there, I can go UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), or RIGHT back to (2,6). All seem open.\n   - **RIGHT to (3,6):** On board? Yes. **My body? YES!** (3,6) is part of my current body\u2014this is hitting myself. Instant death. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\n2) **Eliminate death moves:** UP and DOWN and RIGHT are all death\u2014DOWN and RIGHT are into my own body, UP is safe but no immediate apple. LEFT is the only safe move that also gives an apple? Wait, hold up\u2014I need to re-check the board and apple list. The current board shows \"A\" at (2,6) when I moved there last turn? Actually, in the previous turn, I moved UP to (2,6) and ate an apple there (per last rationale). But looking at the current board state in this prompt:\n   - Board: Row 6 has \"A\" at (2,6)? Wait, the board says:\n     ```\n     6 . A 0 T . . T . . .\n     ```\n     That's row 6 (y=6), columns 0-9. Column 2 (x=2) shows \"A\"? Wait, no: the board is labeled with coordinates, but it's a visual representation. Let's map it correctly.\n   \n**BOARD STATE MAPPING (10x10, (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right):**\n- Row 9 (y=9): `. . . . . . A . . .` \u2192 (6,9) is apple\n- Row 8 (y=8): `. . . . . . . . . .` \u2192 no apples\n- Row 7 (y=7): `. . . T . . T . . .` \u2192 (2,7) is T (my tail?), (6,7) is T (enemy tail?)\n- Row 6 (y=6): `. A 0 T . . T . . .` \u2192 Wait, the prompt says: \"6 . A 0 T . . T . . .\" and then \"5 . . T T . . T T . A\"\n  - Actually, reading the visual:\n    ```\n     6 . A 0 T . . T . . .\n    ```\n    This means: x=0: ., x=1: A, x=2: 0 (my head at (2,6)? But prompt says my head is (2,6)? Wait, prompt says \"Your Snake: Head: (2,6)\", so (2,6) is my head, but the board shows \"0\" at column 2? Wait, the board is right-aligned? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n    ```\n    Board:\n     9 . . . . . . A . . .\n     8 . . . . . . . . . .\n     7 . . . T . . T . . .\n     6 . A 0 T . . T . . .\n     5 . . T T . . T T . A\n     4 . . . . . 1 T T A .\n     3 . . A . . . . A . A\n     2 . . . . . A A . A .\n     1 . . A . . A A . . .\n     0 . A . . . . . . . A\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    ```\n    So, rows are y-coordinates from top (9) to bottom (0). Columns are x from left (0) to right (9). \n    - My head (2,6): Row 6, column 2. In the board for row 6: \" . A 0 T . . T . . .\" \u2192 column 0: ., col1: A, col2: 0 (head?), col3: T (body), etc. Yes, that matches\u2014my head is at (2,6) labeled \"0\".\n    - Apple at (2,6)? No, the \"A\" is at column 1 (x=1, y=6) \u2192 (1,6) is apple. (2,6) is my head, no apple there now because I ate it last turn? But in the apple drops list, (2,6) is listed, but I ate it? Actually, the prompt says apple drops include (2,6), and I ate (3,5) last turn? Wait, last turn I moved UP to (2,6) and ate an apple there, so (2,6) should be gone. But in the current board, row 6 shows \"A\" at col1 (x=1), not col2 (x=2). So (2,6) is my head, no apple there now. Good.\n\n    Now, check for apples in the board visually:\n    - (1,6): Apple (row6, col1)\n    - (2,3): Apple? Row3: \" . . A . . . . A . A \" \u2192 col2: A, so (2,3) is apple.\n    - (1,0): Apple? Row0: \" . A . . . . . . . A \" \u2192 col1: A, so (1,0) apple.\n    - (9,0): Apple? Row0 col9: A, so (9,0) apple.\n    - (6,9): Apple (row9 col6).\n    - (8,2): Apple? Row2: \" . . . . . A A . A .\" \u2192 col8: A, so (8,2) apple.\n    - (9,3): Apple? Row3: \" . . A . . . . A . A \" \u2192 col9: A, so (9,3) apple.\n    - (9,5): Apple? Row5: \" . . T T . . T T . A \" \u2192 col9: A, so (9,5) apple.\n    - (5,2): Apple? Row2 col5: A, so (5,2) apple.\n    - (2,1): Apple? Row1: \" . . A . . A A . . .\" \u2192 col2: A, so (2,1) apple.\n    - (8,4): Apple? Row4: \" . . . . . 1 T T A .\" \u2192 col8: A, so (8,4) apple.\n    - (7,3): Apple? Row3 col7: A, so (7,3) apple.\n    - (6,1): Apple? Row1 col6: A, so (6,1) apple.\n    - (6,2): Apple? Row2 col6: A, so (6,2) apple.\n    - (5,1): Apple? Row1 col5: A, so (5,1) apple.\n    - (1,6): Apple (already noted).\n    - (6,9): Apple (noted).\n\n    So apples are scattered. Now, from my head (2,6), moving UP to (2,7): Row7 is \" . . . T . . T . . . \" \u2192 col2: . (empty), so (2,7) is empty, not my body? My body is at (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). (3,7) is at (3,7), not (2,7). So (2,7) is safe, no apple.\n\n    Moving LEFT to (1,6): Row6 col1 is \"A\" \u2192 apple! Yes, there's an apple at (1,6). So moving LEFT would eat an apple.\n\n    Moving DOWN to (2,5): Row5 col2 is \"T\" \u2192 that's my body (since my body is (2,5), (3,5), etc.). So moving down is into my own body\u2014death.\n\n    Moving RIGHT to (3,6): Row6 col3 is \"T\" \u2192 my body (part of my body list: (3,6) is listed). So moving right is into my own body\u2014death.\n\n    So only UP and LEFT are safe. UP to (2,7) is safe but no apple. LEFT to (1,6) is safe AND has an apple\u2014grow to 5 apples, closing the gap to enemy's 6.\n\n3) **Favor moves with growth and future options:** LEFT to (1,6) eats an apple, grows me, and from there I have UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6) all safe and open. UP to (2,7) is safe but no immediate apple, and from there my options are UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6) (body), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). (3,7) is my body? Yes, (3,7) is in my body list\u2014so RIGHT from (2,7) would be death. Also, DOWN from (2,7) is back to (2,6) which will be body after move, so that's also death in next turn. So UP has fewer future options compared to LEFT.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1,6) to grow to 5 apples, then pivot DOWN to (1,5) to approach lower-left apples like (1,0), (2,1), etc., while boxing out the left side. Force the enemy into the right edge and watch for head-on opportunities once I lead in apples. Stay alert for enemy moves\u2014they might be chasing apples on their side.\n\n**DECISION:**\nLEFT to (1,6) is the best\u2014safe, eats apple, grows me, and keeps multiple future paths open. Let's get that bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

My body? No. Enemy? No (enemy is far right). Safe.  \n  - **DOWN to (1,5):** Row 5 column 1 is \".\" (empty). My body? No. Enemy? No. Safe.  \n  - **LEFT to (0,6):** Row 6 column 0 is \".\" (empty). My body? No. Enemy? No. Safe.  \n  - **RIGHT to (2,6):** Row 6 column 2 is \"T\" \u2014 that's my own body (neck). Moving into myself = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c  \n\n**ELIMINATED: RIGHT (suicide).**  \n\n**ANALYZE SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP to (1,7):**  \n   - Pros: Opens up to upper-left area, maybe (1,8), (2,8) for apples later.  \n   - Cons: From (1,7), future options: UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6) (will be body), LEFT to (0,7), RIGHT to (2,7). (2,7) is empty now, but (1,8) has no apple visible.  \n   - Risk: Enemy might be moving leftward? (5,3) to (4,3) or (3,3) possibly. Not immediate threat.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1,5):**  \n   - Pros: Closer to lower-left apples like (1,0), (2,1). From (1,5), options: UP (1,6) (body), DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), RIGHT (2,5) (body). So three open directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (but RIGHT is (2,5) which is body? Wait, (2,5) is my body? Yes, from body list: (2,5) is part of my body. So RIGHT from (1,5) is (2,5) \u2014 that's body, death. So from (1,5), only DOWN and LEFT are safe. That's two options.  \n   - Cons: Less apples immediately nearby? (1,0) is far, (2,1) is close. But enemy is on right, so leaving left side open might let enemy sneak in? But enemy is at (5,3), likely heading for apples on right like (8,2), (9,3), etc.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (0,6):**  \n   - Pros: Hugs left edge, traps enemy on right. From (0,6), options: UP (0,7), DOWN (0,5), RIGHT (1,6) (body). So two open directions: UP and DOWN. Also, apple at (1,0) is reachable via DOWN path.  \n   - Cons: Only two future options, might get stuck if enemy pushes left? But enemy is far.  \n   - Note: There's an apple at (1,0), but moving LEFT to (0,6) doesn't eat apple now.  \n\n**DECISION FAVOR:**  \n- **DOWN to (1,5)** is the best! Why?  \n  - **Aggressive positioning:** I'm moving DOWN towards the bottom-left, where apples like (1,0), (2,1), (5,1) are located. I can claim that area and force the enemy to stay on the right.  \n  - **Future options:** From (1,5), I can go DOWN to (1,4) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) to eat that apple, or LEFT to (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 etc. to cut off left side.  \n  - **Enemy analysis:** Enemy head (5,3) is likely moving RIGHT or UP toward apples like (8,2), (9,3), (8,4). They're chasing right-side apples. By going DOWN, I'm expanding my territory on the left, boxing them into the right edge.  \n  - **Safety:** From (1,5), I won't be at risk of immediate head-on collision since enemy is far. But I must watch next turn\u2014enemy might move LEFT to (4,3) or (3,3). I'll avoid that.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \n- Keep moving DOWN toward (1,0) apple. Eat that next, then pivot to (2,1) or (5,1) to grow faster.  \n- Once I have 6+ apples, I can force a head-on collision if I'm ahead. Enemy has 6 now, I need to tie or surpass.  \n- Stay alert for enemy moving left\u2014block them! If they move to (4,3), I might move UP to (1,6) or (1,7) to cut off their path to upper-left apples.  \n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! DOWN IT IS!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5  \n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 5) \u2014 just moved DOWN from (1,6) last turn.\n- **My Body:** [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6)] \u2014 my tail is at (3,6).\n- **Enemy Head:** (5,2) \u2014 from (5,3) on last turn? Wait, enemy body shows (5,3) was in their body list, but board shows enemy head at (5,2). So they moved DOWN or LEFT? Board shows (5,2) as \"1\" (enemy head) and (5,3) as \"T\" (enemy tail part). So they likely moved DOWN from (5,3) to (5,2). That means they're moving toward lower-right apples like (8,2), (9,0), (8,0) etc.\n- **Apples of Interest:** (1,0) bottom-left, (2,1), (5,1) nearby. Enemy is chasing right-side apples like (8,2), (9,3), etc.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n**1. UP to (1,6):** This is my current body! (1,6) is the second segment of my body (head is at (1,5), body includes (1,6)). Moving into my own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\n**2. DOWN to (1,4):** \n- Board check: (1,4) is \".\" (empty).\n- My body? No \u2014 my body is at (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6).\n- Enemy body? Enemy is at (5,2) with body extending to (5,3), (5,4), etc. Not near (1,4).\n- **SAFE.** \n- **Future options from (1,4):** \n  - UP back to (1,5) \u2014 but that's head-turning backwards? Wait, (1,5) will be my body after I move (since tail moves). Actually, after moving DOWN, my tail (3,6) moves away, so (1,5) becomes part of body? Let's think: Current head (1,5) moves to (1,4). The tail (3,6) moves forward. So my new body will be [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]. So from (1,4), UP to (1,5) would be into my own body (the segment that was head). That's suicide. So UP is bad.\n  - LEFT to (0,4): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT to (2,4): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN to (1,3): Empty, safe.\n- **Three safe future directions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Good!**\n\n**3. LEFT to (0,5):**\n- Board check: (0,5) is \".\" (empty).\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (0,5):**\n  - UP to (0,6): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN to (0,4): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT back to (1,5): After moving, (1,5) becomes part of body, so moving back to (1,5) would be into my own body. Not safe.\n- **Two safe future directions (UP, DOWN). OK.**\n\n**4. RIGHT to (2,5):**\n- Board check: (2,5) is \"T\" \u2014 that's my own body! (From body list: (2,5) is part of my body).\n- Moving into my own body = INSTANT DEATH. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** DOWN (to 1,4) and LEFT (to 0,5).\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n- **LEFT to (0,5):** Hugs left edge, but only two future options. Might trap me later if I need to move left further. Apple at (1,0) is reachable but longer path.\n- **DOWN to (1,4):** Moves toward bottom-left apples like (1,0) and (2,1). From (1,4), I can go DOWN to (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) to eat that apple! That's a clear path with multiple options. Also, (1,4) is closer to (2,1) apple at (2,1) \u2014 just need to move RIGHT twice.\n\n**AGGRESSION FACTOR:** Enemy is on the right, we're on the left. By going DOWN, we claim the bottom-left territory and force the enemy to stay on the right. If we eat (1,0) soon, we get a point and grow, closing the gap. We're at 5 apples, enemy at 7. We need to catch up!\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** \n- Enemy head at (5,2) is likely moving RIGHT or UP to chase apples like (8,2) or (9,3). Not an immediate threat.\n- If we go DOWN, enemy might move left to (4,2) or (3,2), but we'll be at (1,4) \u2014 still safe distance.\n- We must avoid head-on collisions. But currently, we're far apart.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\n- If we move DOWN to (1,4), next turn aim to go DOWN again to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,4) to intercept (2,1) apple. \n- Keep an eye on enemy \u2014 if they move left aggressively, we might need to move UP to cut them off. But for now, focus on our own growth.\n- Goal: Eat (1,0) within 3-4 moves, then pivot to (2,1) or (5,1) to get to 6+ apples.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! DOWN IT IS!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 We're making that left side OURS!\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**YO WHAT'S GOOD CHAT!** Turn 19 and we're still in the game! Score is 5 vs 8 \u2014 we need to start closing that gap aggressively. The enemy is on the right side, we're on the left. Let's dominate our territory.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (1, 4) after moving DOWN last turn. Smart move, gave us options.\n- **My Body:** [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] \u2014 tail at (3,5). We're growing slower than them, but we're safe.\n- **Enemy Head:** (6,2) \u2014 from (5,2) they moved RIGHT? Board shows (6,2) as enemy head, (5,2) now empty? Wait, enemy body list shows (6,2) is head, body includes (5,2) as tail segment? Let's parse: Enemy body is [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So enemy head was (6,2), body includes (5,2) \u2014 that means they moved LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2)? But board shows (6,2) as \"1\"? Actually, board shows (6,2) as \"1\" (enemy head) and (5,2) as \"T\" (enemy tail). Wait, body list says (5,2) is first after head? That means head is (6,2), then (5,2) is connected. So they moved LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2)? But board says (6,2) is head? Hmm, maybe board is after move? Let's trust the board: (6,2) is \"1\" \u2014 so enemy head at (6,2). Their body includes (5,2) \u2014 so they might have moved RIGHT to (6,2) from (5,2)? Actually, body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is head, each connects to previous. So head is (6,2), next is (5,2) \u2014 that means they moved LEFT? Because head at (6,2), body at (5,2) \u2014 the body is to the LEFT of head. So they likely moved LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2)? Wait, no: If head moves LEFT from (6,2) to (5,2), then new head is (5,2), old head becomes part of body. But body list shows head (6,2), then (5,2) as next \u2014 that means head is at (6,2), and the segment behind it is at (5,2). So they moved RIGHT from (5,2) to (6,2). Yes, that makes sense: previous head at (5,2) moved RIGHT to (6,2), so new head (6,2), old head (5,2) becomes first body segment. So enemy moved RIGHT.\n\n**APPLE WATCH:** We have apples at (1,0), (2,1), (5,1) nearby. Enemy is near (8,2), (9,3) etc. We're in different zones.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS (from (1,4)):**\n\n**1. UP to (1,5):** \n- Board: (1,5) is \"T\" \u2014 that's my own body! (First body segment). Moving into my own body = DEAD. \u274c\n\n**2. DOWN to (1,3):**\n- Board: (1,3) is \".\" (empty).\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No, enemy is far right.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (1,3):** \n  - UP back to (1,4) \u2014 but after moving, (1,4) becomes part of body? Actually, if we move DOWN to (1,3), new body will be [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)] (tail (3,5) moves). So from (1,3), UP to (1,4) is into own body. Not safe.\n  - DOWN to (1,2): Empty, safe.\n  - LEFT to (0,3): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT to (2,3): Board shows (2,3) is \"A\" (apple)! Safe and profitable.\n- **Three safe future directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).** RIGHT gives an apple!\n\n**3. LEFT to (0,4):**\n- Board: (0,4) is \".\" (empty).\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (0,4):**\n  - UP to (0,5): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN to (0,3): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT back to (1,4): After move, (1,4) becomes body, so RIGHT into own body? Not safe.\n- **Two safe future directions (UP, DOWN). OK.**\n\n**4. RIGHT to (2,4):**\n- Board: (2,4) is \".\" (empty).\n- My body? No (my body is at (2,5), (2,6)).\n- Enemy? No.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (2,4):**\n  - UP to (2,5): That's my own body! (Current body includes (2,5)). Not safe.\n  - DOWN to (2,3): That's an apple \"A\"! Safe and profitable.\n  - LEFT to (1,4): After move, (1,4) becomes body? Wait, if we move RIGHT to (2,4), new body will be [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5)]. So from (2,4), LEFT to (1,4) is into own body. Not safe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,4): Empty, safe.\n- **Two safe future directions (DOWN, RIGHT).** DOWN gives an apple!\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n\n- **DOWN to (1,3):** Safe, leads to apple at (2,3) via RIGHT next turn? Actually from (1,3), RIGHT to (2,3) is apple. Also DOWN to (1,2) then (1,1) then (1,0) apple path. Good options.\n- **LEFT to (0,4):** Safe but limited to UP/DOWN. Might corner us against left wall.\n- **RIGHT to (2,4):** Safe, leads to apple at (2,3) via DOWN, and also option RIGHT to (3,4) to explore. But note: moving RIGHT puts us closer to enemy's side? Enemy is at (6,2), still far. But we might want to claim the left-bottom area first.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** Enemy has 8 apples, we have 5. We need to grow! The apple at (2,3) is accessible from both (1,3) and (2,4). From (1,3), we can go RIGHT to (2,3) next turn. From (2,4), we can go DOWN to (2,3) next turn. Both lead to eating (2,3) apple on turn 20.\n\nBut which starting move gives better long-term flexibility? \n\n- **DOWN to (1,3):** Opens up left-bottom corner (1,0 apple) and right to (2,3). More options overall.\n- **RIGHT to (2,4):** Also good, but limits leftward movement because LEFT would be into own body.\n\nAlso, consider enemy movement: Enemy might move LEFT to (5,2) or UP to (6,3) or DOWN to (6,1). If we go RIGHT to (2,4), we're moving slightly right, but still safe distance.\n\n**RISK:** If we go RIGHT to (2,4), next turn we might be forced to go DOWN or RIGHT. If we go DOWN to (2,3) to eat apple, that's great. But if we want to go LEFT later, it's blocked.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to dominate the left side. The apple at (1,0) is a sure thing if we go DOWN now. From (1,3), we can go DOWN to (1,2), then (1,1), then (1,0) \u2014 three moves to eat an apple. That's a clear path. Meanwhile, enemy is busy on the right. We need to grow consistently.\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN to (1,3) is the safest, most flexible move. It keeps us away from our own body, gives us three future directions, and sets up a clear path to (1,0) apple. Also, from (1,3), we can pivot RIGHT to (2,3) next turn if needed.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! DOWN IT IS!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 We're claiming the bottom-left! Time to farm apples and close the gap!\n\nDOWN",

That's our priority!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS (from (1, 3)):**\n\n**1. UP to (1, 4):**\n- Board: (1, 4) is currently empty? Wait, board shows (1, 4) as \".\"? Actually, board shows row 3: \". 0 A . . T . A . A\" \u2014 that's y=3? Let's check coordinates: The board is indexed by y from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom). My head is at (1,3), which is x=1, y=3. The row for y=3 is: \". 0 A . . T . A . A\" \u2014 so (1,3) is my head (0), (2,3) is A, (5,3) is T (enemy body). UP to (1,4) \u2014 that's x=1, y=4. Row y=4: \". T . . . T T T A .\" \u2014 (1,4) is \"T\"? Wait, no: The first character is for x=0? Actually, the board is written with x from 0 to 9. So row y=4: characters for x=0 to 9: index 0: '.', index 1: 'T', index 2: '.', etc. So (1,4) is \"T\" \u2014 that's my own body! Because my body includes (1,4). So moving UP into (1,4) is into my own body \u2192 DEAD. \u274c\n\n**2. DOWN to (1, 2):**\n- Board: (1, 2) is \".\" (empty, row y=2: \". . . . . T T . A .\").\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No, enemy is at (6,1) and body elsewhere.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (1,2):** \n  - UP back to (1,3) \u2014 but after moving, (1,3) becomes part of body? Actually, if we move DOWN to (1,2), new body will be [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] (tail (2,5) moves). So from (1,2), UP to (1,3) is into own body. Not safe.\n  - DOWN to (1,1): Board shows (1,1) is \"A\" (apple)! Safe and profitable.\n  - LEFT to (0,2): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT to (2,2): Board shows (2,2) is \"T\" (enemy body? Actually, row y=2: (2,2) is \"T\" \u2014 that's likely enemy body? Wait, enemy body includes (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), etc. (2,2) might be something else? Actually, board shows (2,2) as \"T\" but our body doesn't include (2,2). Enemy body doesn't include (2,2) either. Might be a typo? Let's assume it's empty or enemy? I'll check: Enemy body list: [(6,1) head, (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6)]. So (2,2) is not enemy. But board says \"T\" \u2014 could be a tail of something? Actually, our body tail is at (2,5). So (2,2) is empty? I'll trust the board: it says \"T\" so it's occupied by some snake body. So RIGHT to (2,2) might be dangerous. I'll avoid.\n- **Two safe future directions (DOWN to apple, LEFT to wall).** Not great, but DOWN to apple is good.\n\n**3. LEFT to (0, 3):**\n- Board: (0, 3) is \".\" (empty, row y=3: x=0 is \".\").\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options from (0,3):**\n  - UP to (0,4): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN to (0,2): Empty, safe.\n  - RIGHT back to (1,3): After move, (1,3) becomes body, so RIGHT into own body? Not safe.\n- **Two safe future directions (UP, DOWN).** Not great for apples.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n- Board: (2, 3) is \"A\" (apple)! \n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No (enemy is at (6,1) and body at (5,3), (6,3) etc? Actually, (5,3) is \"T\" in row y=3, so (2,3) is clear.\n- **SAFE AND PROFITABLE!**\n- **Future options from (2,3):**\n  - UP to (2,4): Board shows (2,4) is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n  - DOWN to (2,2): Board shows (2,2) is \"T\" \u2014 might be occupied. Caution.\n  - LEFT to (1,3): After move, (1,3) becomes body, so LEFT into own body? Not safe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,3): Empty, safe.\n- **Three safe future directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).** DOWN might be into \"T\" so maybe not. But UP and RIGHT are clear.\n- **PLUS WE EAT AN APPLE!** This gives us +1 score, growing to 6 apples. We need to close the gap!\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nThe apple at (2,3) is RIGHT THERE. Moving RIGHT to (2,3) is SAFE, gives us an apple, and opens up options (UP, RIGHT). From (2,3), we can then go UP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3) to explore further. The downside: LEFT becomes blocked by our own body, but that's fine \u2014 we're moving forward into enemy territory? Not really, still left side.\n\nMeanwhile, moving DOWN to (1,2) is safe but doesn't give an apple immediately (we'd need to go DOWN again to (1,1) for that apple). That's two moves away. The apple at (1,1) is also valuable, but we can get it later.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** We need apples NOW to catch up. Enemy has 9, we have 5. Eating (2,3) brings us to 6. That's momentum!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (2,3) now. Then from (2,3), move UP to (2,4) to open up more space and possibly head toward (2,1) or (1,0) apples. Avoid getting boxed in on the left. Keep an eye on enemy movement \u2014 they might come toward us if we grow.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT! RIGHT IT IS!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e Time to snack and chase that score! We're not losing this!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to be aggressive, smart, and force the enemy into mistakes. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 3) \u2014 perfect! We ate that apple last turn, so we\u2019re now at 6 apples. Grow up, eat up.\n- **My Body:** [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5)] \u2014 tail is (2, 5). We\u2019re safe, not boxed in.\n- **Enemy Head:** (5, 1) \u2014 they moved DOWN from (6, 1) to (5, 1)? Actually, check board: last turn they were at (6, 1), now head is (5, 1). So they moved LEFT. They\u2019re hunting apples on the bottom-left? (1, 0) and (0, 0) are apples, but they\u2019re far. They might be coming toward us!\n- **Apple Watch:** There\u2019s an apple at (2, 1) just DOWN from our head? (2, 1) is an apple per the list! Let\u2019s check board: row y=1 (second from bottom) shows \". . A . . 1 T A . .\" So (2, 1) is \"A\". YES! That\u2019s a target.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (2, 3):**\n\n**1. UP to (2, 4):**\n- Board: (2, 4) is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No, enemy is at (5,1) and body elsewhere.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options:** \n  - UP to (2,5): That\u2019s our tail! After moving, tail moves, so (2,5) might become empty? Actually, if we move UP, new body = [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] with tail at (2,6). So (2,5) is free? Wait, (2,5) is currently occupied by our tail. After move, tail moves to (2,6), so (2,5) becomes empty. So UP to (2,4) then UP to (2,5) is safe? But (2,5) is currently our tail, but after one move it moves. So yes, safe.\n  - LEFT to (1,4): That\u2019s our body! After moving, (1,4) becomes part of body, so LEFT would be into own body \u2192 dead. Not safe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,4): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN back to (2,3): That\u2019s now our head? Actually, after moving UP, (2,3) becomes body. So DOWN into own body \u2192 dead. Not safe.\n- **Two safe future directions (UP, RIGHT).** OK but not great.\n\n**2. DOWN to (2, 2):**\n- Board: (2, 2) is \"T\" per the board. But is that enemy body? Let\u2019s check: Enemy body includes (5,2), (6,2), etc. Not (2,2). Our body doesn\u2019t include (2,2). The board might show \"T\" for tail of something? Actually, row y=2: \". . . . . T T . A .\" \u2014 (2,2) is \"T\". Could be a tail of the enemy? But enemy tail is at (6,6) maybe? Their body list ends with (6,6). So (2,2) is NOT enemy. Might be a mistake on board? I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s empty or safe? But I can\u2019t risk moving into a \"T\" \u2014 that\u2019s likely a snake body. So unsafe.\n\n**3. LEFT to (1, 3):**\n- Board: (1, 3) is currently our head? Wait, our head is at (2,3). (1,3) is the first segment of our body. So moving LEFT into (1,3) would hit our own body \u2192 DEAD. \u274c\n\n**4. RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n- Board: (3, 3) is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? No.\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options:**\n  - UP to (3,4): Empty, safe.\n  - DOWN to (3,2): Empty? Row y=2: (3,2) is \".\" (since row y=2: \". . . . . T T . A .\" so x=3 is \".\") safe.\n  - LEFT back to (2,3): After move, (2,3) becomes body, so LEFT into own body \u2192 dead.\n  - RIGHT to (4,3): Empty, safe.\n- **Three safe future directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).** This opens up more space and options. Good for exploration.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nWe have an apple at (2, 1) just DOWN two steps. But moving DOWN to (2,2) is risky because it\u2019s marked \"T\". I suspect it might be a false alarm, but I can\u2019t gamble on a live stream. Moving RIGHT to (3,3) is safe and gives us three future options. It also moves us away from the enemy who is at (5,1) \u2014 they might be heading toward (2,1) apple themselves. If we go RIGHT, we can loop around and maybe cut them off.\n\nAlso, the apple at (2,1) is close. From (3,3), we could go DOWN to (3,2) then LEFT to (2,2)? But (2,2) is \"T\" \u2014 still risky. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about UP to (2,4)? That\u2019s safe too, but fewer options. RIGHT gives us more space to maneuver.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** We need to close the apple gap. But we can\u2019t rush blindly. The enemy has 10 apples, we have 6. If we can eat one apple safely, we should. But (2,1) might not be safe if the enemy is heading there. Let\u2019s think: Enemy head at (5,1). They could move LEFT to (4,1) or DOWN to (5,0) or UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1). (5,0) is empty? Row y=0: \"A A . . . . . . . A\" \u2014 (5,0) is \".\". So they could go DOWN to (5,0). They might not be coming to (2,1) immediately.\n\nBut if we go RIGHT, we\u2019re moving away from that apple. However, we\u2019re opening up the board for future apples like (1,0) or (0,0). \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (3,3), we can move DOWN to (3,2) then LEFT to (2,2) if it\u2019s safe. Or we can go RIGHT toward (4,3) and explore. We need to keep options open and avoid tight spaces.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** We\u2019re playing smart, not reckless. RIGHT it is to expand our territory and keep future moves flexible. We\u2019ll hunt apples later when we have better positioning.\n\nRIGHT",

We need to play aggressively but smart\u2014force the enemy into mistakes while securing our own survival. Let's break this down.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (3, 3) \u2014 just moved right from (2, 3). We're safe and in a solid position.\n- **My Body:** [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6)] \u2014 tail is (2, 6). No immediate self-collision threats.\n- **Enemy Head:** (4, 1) \u2014 they're on the bottom-left side. They have 10 apples and are likely hunting for more. Their body extends upward and rightward, potentially blocking paths.\n- **Apple Watch:** There's an apple at (2, 1) just two steps down-left from us, but moving directly there might be risky. Other apples are scattered, like (1, 0), (0, 0), (7, 3), etc. We need to plan a path to an apple while keeping options open.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (3, 3):**\n\n**1. UP to (3, 4):**\n- Board: (3, 4) is \"T\" (enemy body). Row 4 shows \" . T . . . T T T A .\" \u2014 at x=3, y=4, it's \"T\". That's enemy body! Moving up into an enemy snake = death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**2. DOWN to (3, 2):**\n- Board: (3, 2) is \".\" (empty). Row 2: \". . . . . T T . A .\" \u2014 (3, 2) is dot. Safe.\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy? Enemy head is at (4, 1), body includes (5, 2), (6, 2), etc. Not (3, 2).\n- **SAFE.**\n- **Future options:**\n  - DOWN to (3, 1): Row 1: \". . A . 1 T T A . .\" \u2014 (3, 1) is \"A\"? Actually, (3, 1) is the fourth character: \". . A . 1 T T A . .\" So positions: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 'A', x=3 '.', x=4 '1', x=5 'T', etc. So (3, 1) is '.' (empty). Good.\n  - LEFT to (2, 2): Row 2: (2, 2) is '.' (since x=2 is '.'). Actually row 2: \". . . . . T T . A .\" \u2014 x=2 is the third character: '.' Yes! (2, 2) is empty. Wait, earlier I thought it was \"T\" but that was a mistake. Let's double-check: y=2 row: columns 0-9: 0 '.', 1 '.', 2 '.', 3 '.', 4 '.', 5 'T', 6 'T', 7 '.', 8 'A', 9 '.' So (2,2) is '.' empty. Good!\n  - RIGHT to (4, 2): (4, 2) is '.' (since x=4 is '.'). Safe.\n  - UP back to (3, 3): That's our current head, but after moving down, (3,3) becomes body, so moving back up would hit own body \u2192 death. Not safe.\n- **Three safe future directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).** Excellent space.\n\n**3. LEFT to (2, 3):**\n- Board: (2, 3) is currently \"T\" (my own body). After my move, my head moves away, but the body shifts. At the moment of moving, (2, 3) is occupied by my body. Moving left into (2, 3) would hit my own body \u2192 death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n- Board: (4, 3) is \"T\" (enemy body). Row 3: \". T T . T . T . A A\" \u2014 at x=4, y=3, it's \"T\". That's enemy body! Moving right into enemy = death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**DECISION:**\nOnly **DOWN to (3, 2)** is safe! All other directions lead to immediate death. That's a clutch survival move. From (3, 2), we'll have multiple escape routes: DOWN toward (3, 1) and possibly an apple at (2, 1) or (1, 0), LEFT to (2, 2) which is empty, or RIGHT to (4, 2). \n\n**AGGRESSION:** Even though we're playing safe, we need to think about closing the apple gap. From (3, 2), we can head toward the apple at (2, 1) by going LEFT to (2, 2) then DOWN to (2, 1). Or if the enemy goes for it, we might intercept. But first, survive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (3, 2), I'll likely go LEFT to (2, 2) to position myself for the apple at (2, 1) or (1, 0). I'll watch the enemy's move\u2014if they go for (2, 1), I might need to divert. Keep options open and avoid tight spaces. We're in a good spot to maneuver and hunt.\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** We're staying alive and setting up for a comeback. Downward march to victory! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

But let's think carefully.\n- **Apples Nearby:** There's an apple at (2, 1) \u2014 two steps LEFT and DOWN from me (via (2, 2) then DOWN). Also (1, 0) and (0, 0) down-left. (7, 3) is far right. We need to snag something soon.\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (3, 2):**\n\n**1. UP to (3, 3):**\n- Board: (3, 3) is \"T\" \u2014 my own body! It's still there from last turn (since I just moved down, my body shifts, but (3, 3) is now part of my tail). Moving UP into my own body = death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**2. DOWN to (3, 1):**\n- Board: (3, 1) is \"1\" \u2014 enemy head! They're already there. If I move DOWN into (3, 1) and they stay or move elsewhere, I'd be moving into their body (head is part of body), so I die. BUT if they move OUT of (3, 1) at the same time, it might be safe? In snake games, you check collisions after all moves. If I move into a cell they vacate, I survive. However, they could also move UP into (3, 2) \u2014 my current head position. That would mean our heads swap spots, but that's allowed? Wait, no: if their head moves into (3, 2) and my head moves into (3, 1), no collision. BUT if they stay or move into (3, 1) while I'm there, I die. It's risky because they might anticipate and block. More importantly, their body is nearby: row 1 shows \"T T T\" starting at x=4? Actually \". . A 1 T T T A . .\" So at x=4,5,6 it's \"T T T\" \u2014 their body. (3,1) is head, (4,1) is likely body, etc. If I go down, I'd be adjacent to their body, potentially leading to a trap. Plus, from (3,1), my future options might be limited: up back to (3,2) would be into my own body (shifted), left to (2,1) is apple but enemy might go there, right to (4,1) is enemy body. So this move could lead to a dead end. High risk, low reward. \u274c **RISKY, POTENTIAL DEATH.** Avoid unless desperate.\n\n**3. LEFT to (2, 2):**\n- Board: (2, 2) is \".\" (empty). Row 2: \". . . . . T T . A .\" \u2014 x=2 is '.' Yes! Safe.\n- My body? After moving, my head at (2,2), old head (3,2) becomes body, but (2,2) is empty now. No self-collision.\n- Enemy? Enemy head at (3,1), body includes (4,1), (5,1), etc. (2,2) is not enemy. Safe.\n- **Future options from (2,2):**\n  - UP to (2,3): That's my own body! (2,3) is in my body list. So UP would be death. Not good.\n  - DOWN to (2,1): Empty? Row 1: (2,1) is \"A\" \u2014 apple! But check: row 1: \". . A 1 T T T A . .\" x=2 is 'A' \u2014 yes, apple at (2,1). Safe and edible.\n  - LEFT to (1,2): Row 2: x=1 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,2): That's where I came from, now it's body, so moving back into own body? Actually, after moving left, (3,2) becomes part of my tail. If I later move right back, it could be death. But immediate future: LEFT gives me DOWN to apple, LEFT to (1,2) which is open, and possibly RIGHT back (though risky).\n- **Score:** Moving to (2,2) positions me perfectly for the apple at (2,1) next turn. That's +1 apple and growth, closing the score gap. Also, it's away from enemy's immediate area. Multiple safe follow-ups (DOWN, LEFT). \u2705 **SAFE, HIGH REWARD, FUTURE OPTIONS OPEN.**\n\n**4. RIGHT to (4, 2):**\n- Board: (4, 2) is \".\" (empty). Row 2: x=4 is '.' Yes! Safe.\n- My body? No issue.\n- Enemy? Enemy body at (4,1) below, but (4,2) is above it, empty. Safe.\n- **Future options from (4,2):**\n  - UP to (4,3): Row 3: (4,3) is \"T\" \u2014 enemy body! So UP = death.\n  - DOWN to (4,1): Enemy body! Death.\n  - LEFT to (3,2): My own body (shifted), death.\n  - RIGHT to (5,2): Row 2: x=5 is \"T\" \u2014 enemy body! Death.\n- **Trapped!** From (4,2), all immediate moves lead to death or enemy body. No safe paths. This is a dead end. \u274c **IMMEDIATELY TRAPPED, NO FUTURE OPTIONS.** Worst choice.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **LEFT to (2, 2)** is the ONLY safe move with future options. DOWN is risky, UP/RIGHT are death or trap. We need to survive and set up for apples. (2,2) lets us grab the apple at (2,1) next turn if it's still there, and keeps us mobile toward the left side where apples like (1,0) and (0,0) are. Meanwhile, the enemy is below us; if they go for the same apple, we might force a collision or redirect. With 10 apples, they're confident, but we're aggressive\u2014we'll use this to dominate the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (2,2), go DOWN to (2,1) to eat the apple and grow. Then position toward the left-bottom apples ((1,0) or (0,0)) while watching the enemy. If they block, we flank right or up. We're plotting to force a head-on collision later if we pull ahead. Let's move!\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** We're turning this around, one apple at a time. Stay sharp! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

We're down 6 apples to 11, but we're not done yet. That apple at (2, 1) is BEGGING to be eaten, and we're the snake to do it. Let's break it down and plot our next move like the aggressive competitors we are.\n\n**CURRENT STATE CHECK:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 2) \u2014 positioned perfectly, ready to strike!\n- **My Body:** [(3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)] \u2014 tail is (1, 5). No self-collision threats immediately.\n- **Enemy Head:** (2, 1) \u2014 wait, that's the apple! Actually, looking at the board: row 1 (y=1): \". . A 1 T T T A . .\" So at (2,1) it's 'A' (apple), and at (3,1) it's '1' (enemy head). Enemy head is still at (3,1)? But last turn they were at (3,1). They might move, but their body is along row 1 from x=4 to x=7. If I go DOWN to (2,1), I'd be eating an apple AND potentially getting close to the enemy.\n- **Apples Nearby:** (2,1) is RIGHT THERE. Also (1,0) and (0,0) are down-left. (8,2) is far right but maybe out of reach. We need to eat now to close the gap!\n\n**MOVE OPTIONS FROM (2, 2):**\n\n**1. UP to (2, 3):**\n- Board: (2, 3) is \"T\" \u2014 my own body! It's in my body list. Moving UP into my own body = death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**2. DOWN to (2, 1):**\n- Board: (2, 1) is \"A\" \u2014 an apple! Safe to move onto.\n- My body? After moving, my head at (2,1), old head (2,2) becomes body. (2,1) was empty before, so no self-collision.\n- Enemy? Enemy head at (3,1), body along (4,1), (5,1), etc. (2,1) is not enemy body. Safe.\n- **Future options from (2,1):**\n  - UP to (2,2): That's where I came from, now it's body. Moving back into own body? Actually, after moving down, (2,2) becomes part of my tail. If I move UP back to (2,2), it would be into my own body (tail), which is death. So UP is risky.\n  - DOWN to (2,0): Row 0: (2,0) is \"A\" \u2014 apple! Also safe.\n  - LEFT to (1,1): Row 1: (1,1) is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n  - RIGHT to (3,1): Enemy head! If I move right, I'd be moving into their head. That's a head-on collision if they stay or move into (2,1). But simultaneous move: if I go RIGHT and they go LEFT into (2,1), we collide. If they go elsewhere, I might die into their body. High risk! But maybe we can force it later if we have advantage.\n- **Score:** Moving DOWN gives +1 apple (grow), closing gap to 7 vs 11. Safe immediate move. Future options: DOWN to apple, LEFT to open space. RIGHT is dangerous but could be used if we have more apples. \u2705 **SAFE, HIGH REWARD, FUTURE OPTIONS OPEN (except UP).**\n\n**3. LEFT to (1, 2):**\n- Board: (1, 2) is \".\" (empty). Row 2: x=1 is '.' Yes! Safe.\n- My body? No issue.\n- Enemy? Enemy body at (1,3)? My own body! Actually (1,3) is my body. (1,2) is empty. Safe.\n- **Future options from (1,2):**\n  - UP to (1,3): My own body! Death.\n  - DOWN to (1,1): Empty? Row 1: (1,1) is '.' Yes. Safe.\n  - LEFT to (0,2): Row 2: (0,2) is \".\" (empty). Safe.\n  - RIGHT to (2,2): My own body (shifted), death.\n- **Trapped?** From (1,2), we have DOWN and LEFT as safe moves. Not completely trapped, but fewer options than from (2,2). Also, we're not grabbing the apple at (2,1). \u274c **SAFE BUT LESS AGGRESSIVE, MISSING APPLE OPPORTUNITY.**\n\n**4. RIGHT to (3, 2):**\n- Board: (3, 2) is \"T\" \u2014 my own body! It's in my body list. Moving RIGHT into my own body = death. \u274c **IMMEDIATE DEATH.** Can't do that.\n\n**DECISION:**\n- **DOWN to (2, 1)** is the clear winner! It's safe, gets us an apple (+1 point), and keeps us mobile toward the bottom-left apples ((2,0) and (1,0)). LEFT is safe but misses the apple and gives us fewer future options. We're being aggressive\u2014let's eat and grow! Meanwhile, enemy is at (3,1); if they go LEFT to (2,1) while we go DOWN, we might collide? But we're moving into (2,1) and they're at (3,1); if they go LEFT, they'd move into (2,1) at the same time as us\u2014head-on collision! That's a DOUBLE KILL, but we'd both die. However, we're confident they might go for something else (like chasing other apples). We have a plan: eat, then go for (2,0) or flank left.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** From (2,1), go DOWN to (2,0) to eat that apple too! Then move LEFT toward (1,0) or (0,0) while keeping an eye on the enemy. If they get too close, we might force a collision later when we have more apples (we need to catch up!). We're dominating the board, one apple at a time. Let's close that gap!\n\n**LET'S GO CHAT!** We're hungry! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",
