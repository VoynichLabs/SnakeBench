This move is unsafe (moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 5), DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4).\n\nLet's find the closest apple to my current position (4, 4).

(Decreases distance)\n- Move DOWN to (4, 3): Distance to (3, 5) is |4-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Increases distance)\n- Move LEFT to (3, 4): Distance to (3, 5) is |3-3| + |4-5| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Decreases distance)\n\nBoth moving UP to (4, 5) and moving LEFT to (3, 4) decrease the distance to the nearest apple (3, 5) to 1. Both are good moves for approaching the apple.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy snake has body segments at (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2). This occupies the x=3 column in the lower part of the board.\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 4) places my head on the x=3 column, adjacent to the enemy body segments (though currently separated by two squares vertically).\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) keeps my head on the x=4 column, one step horizontally away from the enemy body's column.\n\nGiven the enemy snake's presence on the x=3 column, moving LEFT to (3, 4) might put me in a less favorable position if the enemy moves upwards in subsequent turns or grows into that space. Moving UP to (4, 5) seems slightly safer as it maintains more distance from the main concentration of the enemy body. Both moves position me one step away from the target apple (3, 5) for the next turn.\n\nBased on avoiding potential conflict with the longer enemy snake, moving UP is the preferred choice.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving UP to (4,5), my head will be at (4,5) and body at [(4,4)]. The closest apple (3,5) will be one step to the LEFT. If the path remains clear and safe, I will aim to move LEFT to (3,5) to eat the apple.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

It occupies these five squares and has length 5.\nApples are located at (1, 2), (8, 0), (0, 6), (5, 8), and (8, 6).\n\nMy current head position is (3, 4). I need to choose a safe move to an adjacent square.\nAdjacent squares are:\n- UP: (3, 5)\n- DOWN: (3, 3)\n- LEFT: (2, 4)\n- RIGHT: (4, 4)\n\nLet's evaluate the safety of each potential move:\n1. Move UP to (3, 5):\n   - Within board boundaries (0-9, 0-9): Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body: Yes, (3,5) is the body segment immediately behind my head. Moving here would mean reversing direction into myself, which is unsafe.\n2. Move DOWN to (3, 3):\n   - Within board boundaries: Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body: No.\n   - Occupied by enemy snake [(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)]: No.\n   - Safe.\n3. Move LEFT to (2, 4):\n   - Within board boundaries: Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body: No.\n   - Occupied by enemy snake: No.\n   - Safe.\n4. Move RIGHT to (4, 4):\n   - Within board boundaries: Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body: Yes, (4,4) is the tail segment in my body sequence [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. Moving onto the tail is safe in a standard Snake game as the tail moves out of the way.\n   - Occupied by enemy snake: No.\n   - Safe.\n\nSafe moves are DOWN (3, 3), LEFT (2, 4), and RIGHT (4, 4). UP is unsafe because it runs into the segment immediately behind the head.\n\nNow, let's consider the objective: eat apples. I should try to move towards the closest apple.\nMy current position is (3, 4). Let's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n- To (1, 2): |3-1| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- To (8, 0): |3-8| + |4-0| = 5 + 4 = 9\n- To (0, 6): |3-0| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- To (5, 8): |3-5| + |4-8| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- To (8, 6): |3-8| + |4-6| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 2), which is 4 steps away.\n\nLet's evaluate which safe move gets me closer to the apple at (1,2) or positions me well to reach it.\n- Move DOWN to (3, 3): From (3,3), distance to (1,2) is |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Total path distance 1+3=4)\n- Move LEFT to (2, 4): From (2,4), distance to (1,2) is |2-1| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Total path distance 1+3=4)\n- Move RIGHT to (4, 4): From (4,4), distance to (1,2) is |4-1| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5. (Total path distance 1+5=6)\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT moves lead to a position that is 3 steps away from the closest apple at (1,2). Moving RIGHT moves me further from this apple.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT seem like good choices to approach the apple at (1,2). Moving DOWN to (3,3) positions me lower on the board, which could be slightly better for accessing apples on the bottom half like (1,2) and (8,0). Moving LEFT to (2,4) positions me towards the left edge.\n\nLet's choose to move DOWN to (3,3). It's safe and moves towards the closest apple. The enemy snake is currently far away and not a threat to this move or the immediate path towards the apple at (1,2).\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (3,3), my head will be at (3,3) and my body will be [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. My length remains 4 as I did not eat an apple. I will then re-evaluate the board state, confirm the closest apple (likely still (1,2)), and plan the next safe move towards it, while monitoring the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

The enemy snake #1 is still far away at (1, 3) on the left side of the board, so no immediate threat.\n\nBy continuing UP, I'll be at (8, 3), then (8, 4), (8, 5), and finally reach the apple at (8, 6) in just 3 more moves. After collecting that apple, I can evaluate whether to continue to (8, 8) for the second apple or change course.\n\nThis is textbook snake strategy - finding a safe corridor with multiple rewards and exploiting it fully.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue UP along the right edge. I'm now 3 moves away from the apple at (8, 6). Keep monitoring the enemy snake's position but they seem to be focused on the left side of the board.\n\nUP"

Move UP to (1, 3): This coordinate is currently occupied by the first segment of my body. Moving UP would be moving backwards, which is unsafe.\n2. Move DOWN to (1, 1): This is within the board boundaries and is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n3. Move LEFT to (0, 2): This is within the board boundaries.

Move RIGHT to (2, 2): This is within the board boundaries and is not occupied by my body or the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nSafe moves are DOWN (1,1), LEFT (0,2), and RIGHT (2,2).\n\nNow, I'll find the closest apple to my current head position (1, 2).\nApples are at: (0, 6), (5, 8), (8, 6), (8, 8), (0, 2).\n- To (0, 6): Manhattan distance |1-0| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- To (5, 8): Manhattan distance |1-5| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10\n- To (8, 6): Manhattan distance |1-8| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n- To (8, 8): Manhattan distance |1-8| + |2-8| = 7 + 6 = 13\n- To (0, 2): Manhattan distance |1-0| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThe closest apple is at (0, 2).\n\nNow, evaluate which safe moves move towards the closest apple at (0, 2):\n- Current position (1, 2), distance to (0,2) is 1.\n- Move DOWN to (1, 1): Distance to (0,2) from (1,1) is |1-0| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Further)\n- Move LEFT to (0, 2): Distance to (0,2) from (0,2) is |0-0| + |2-2| = 0 + 0 = 0. (Reaches apple)\n- Move RIGHT to (2, 2): Distance to (0,2) from (2,2) is |2-0| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2. (Further)\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,2) directly reaches the closest apple and is a safe move. This is the optimal move to make.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving LEFT and eating the apple at (0,2), my new head position will be (0,2). My length will increase, and my body segments will shift. I will then find the next closest apple from my new position (0,2) and plan a safe path towards it, while also considering the position of the enemy snake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{LEFT}$."

Move UP to (0, 7): This is within the board boundaries. It is not occupied by my current body segments [(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. It is not occupied by the enemy snake (head at (7,7), body at [(7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]). This move is safe.\n2. Move DOWN to (0, 5): This is within the board boundaries. It is occupied by the first segment of my current body (0, 5). Moving DOWN would be moving backwards into myself. This move is unsafe.\n3. Move LEFT to (-1, 6): This is outside the board boundaries (x < 0). Moving LEFT would hit a wall. This move is unsafe.\n4. Move RIGHT to (1, 6): This is within the board boundaries. It is not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by the enemy snake. This move is safe.\n\nBased on this analysis, the safe moves available are UP to (0, 7) and RIGHT to (1, 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the closest apple to my current head position (0, 6).\nApples are at: (5, 8), (8, 8), (5, 9), (2, 4), (9, 4).\n- Distance to (5, 8): |0-5| + |6-8| = 5 + 2 = 7\n- Distance to (8, 8): |0-8| + |6-8| = 8 + 2 = 10\n- Distance to (5, 9): |0-5| + |6-9| = 5 + 3 = 8\n- Distance to (2, 4): |0-2| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- Distance to (9, 4): |0-9| + |6-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 4) with a Manhattan distance of 4.\n\nLet's evaluate how the safe moves affect the distance to the closest apple (2, 4):\n- Current position (0, 6), distance to (2, 4) is 4.\n- After moving UP to (0, 7), the distance to (2, 4) would be |0-2| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5. Moving UP increases distance to (2, 4).\n- After moving RIGHT to (1, 6), the distance to (2, 4) would be |1-2| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3. Moving RIGHT decreases distance to (2, 4).\n\nMoving RIGHT leads me closer to the closest apple (2, 4). Moving UP leads me further away from the closest apple (2, 4). Both moves are safe. Pursuing the closest food source is a standard strategy.\n\nThe enemy snake is on the right side of the board (head at 7,7). Moving RIGHT will bring me slightly closer to that side of the board, but the distance remains significant, and there appears to be open space between my potential positions (1,6) and the enemy.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is the optimal choice to pursue food while remaining safe.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT to (1,6), my head will be at (1,6). My body will update accordingly. The closest apple will likely still be at (2,4). I will re-evaluate safe moves from (1,6) and plan to move towards (2,4), likely via (2,6) then (2,5) then (2,4), provided the path remains safe. I will also continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{RIGHT}$."

Now I need to decide my next move.\n\nLet me analyze my current options from (7, 7):\n\n- UP: Would take me to (7, 8) - This is safe, open space\n- DOWN: Would take me to (7, 6) - DEATH! That's where my body segment is now\n- LEFT: Would take me to (6, 7) - This is safe, open space  \n- RIGHT: Would take me to (8, 7) - This is safe, open space\n\nSo I have three safe directions: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the apple positions and my strategy from last turn:\n- (5, 8) - Upper middle area, 2 spaces left and 1 up from me\n- (8, 8) - Upper right area, 1 space right and 1 up from me\n- (5, 9) - Top middle area\n- (2, 4) - Lower left area\n- (9, 4) - Lower right area\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is still at (0, 6) on the far left side, so not an immediate threat.\n\nAs I planned last turn, I'm now in position to go for either the (5, 8) or (8, 8) apple. Both are equally close - just 2 moves away. Let me think about which is better:\n\n- (8, 8): I could go RIGHT to (8, 7), then UP to (8, 8). This keeps me on the right side of the board, away from the enemy snake.\n- (5, 8): I could go UP to (7, 8), then LEFT twice to (5, 8).\n\nActually, the most efficient path to (8, 8) would be UP to (7, 8), then RIGHT to (8, 8). And for (5, 8) it would be UP to (7, 8), then LEFT twice.\n\nBoth paths start with UP to (7, 8), so that seems like the optimal move. This keeps my options open for both apples and gets me closer to the apple-rich upper area.\n\nGoing UP to (7, 8) positions me perfectly to then choose between the two nearest apples on my next turn.\n\nStrategy for next turn: From (7, 8), decide between going RIGHT to (8, 8) or LEFT toward (5, 8). The (8, 8) apple might be slightly better since it keeps me away from potential enemy snake expansion, and after eating it I could potentially go for the (5, 9) apple.\n\nUP"

This move is safe.\n\nBased on this analysis, the safe moves available are UP to (2, 7), DOWN to (2, 5), and RIGHT to (3, 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the closest apple to my current head position (2, 6).\nApples are at: (5, 8), (5, 9), (2, 4), (9, 4), (9, 9).\n- Distance to (5, 8): |2-5| + |6-8| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- Distance to (5, 9): |2-5| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- Distance to (2, 4): |2-2| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- Distance to (9, 4): |2-9| + |6-4| = 7 + 2 = 9\n- Distance to (9, 9): |2-9| + |6-9| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 4) with a Manhattan distance of 2.\n\nLet's evaluate how the safe moves affect the distance to the closest apple (2, 4):\n- Current position (2, 6), distance to (2, 4) is 2.\n- After moving UP to (2, 7), the distance to (2, 4) would be |2-2| + |7-4| = 0 + 3 = 3. Moving UP increases distance.\n- After moving DOWN to (2, 5), the distance to (2, 4) would be |2-2| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1. Moving DOWN decreases distance.\n- After moving RIGHT to (3, 6), the distance to (2, 4) would be |3-2| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3. Moving RIGHT increases distance.\n\nMoving DOWN is the only safe move that reduces the distance to the closest apple (2, 4). The enemy snake is not close enough to interfere with this move.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN to (2,5), my head will be at (2,5). My body will update accordingly. The closest apple will still be at (2,4). I will re-evaluate safe moves from (2,5) and aim to move DOWN again to (2,4) to eat the apple, provided the path remains safe (e.g., the apple isn't eaten by another snake or the spot isn't blocked). I will also continue to monitor the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{DOWN}$."

My tail is at (0, 4).\nApples are at: (5, 8), (5, 9), (9, 4), (1, 5), (6, 8).\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (8, 9).\n\nPossible moves from (1, 4):\n- UP to (1, 5): This square is within bounds (0-9, 0-9). It is an apple location. It is not occupied by my body segments (excluding the tail which will move). It is not occupied by the enemy snake's body or head. Safe.\n- DOWN to (1, 3): This square is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body segments. It is not occupied by the enemy snake. Safe.\n- LEFT to (0, 4): This square is within bounds. It is my tail segment. Moving into the tail is safe as the tail moves before the head occupies the space. Not occupied by the enemy snake. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2, 4): This square is my neck segment. Moving RIGHT is moving backward into myself. Unsafe.\n\nSafe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nLet's find the closest apple to my current head position (1, 4):\n- (5, 8): |5-1| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n- (5, 9): |5-1| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n- (9, 4): |9-1| + |4-4| = 8 + 0 = 8\n- (1, 5): |1-1| + |5-4| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- (6, 8): |6-1| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 5) with a Manhattan distance of 1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the safe moves in relation to the closest apple (1, 5):\n- Moving UP to (1, 5): Distance to (1, 5) is |1-1| + |5-5| = 0 + 0 = 0. This move lands me on the apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (1, 3): Distance to (1, 5) is |1-1| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 4): Distance to (1, 5) is |1-0| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nMoving UP to (1, 5) is a safe move that lands me on the closest apple. This is the optimal move to get points and grow. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to the squares I am considering moving into.\n\nStrategy for next turn: My head will be at (1, 5), having eaten an apple. My body will grow. I will assess the updated board state, the remaining apples, and the positions of enemy snakes to determine the next best move, prioritizing safe paths to the nearest accessible apple.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{UP}$."

That's where my body segment is now\n\nSo LEFT to (7, 9) is my only viable option.\n\n**Current strategy assessment:**\nI'm executing my plan to reach the apple cluster at (5, 8) and (5, 9). Moving LEFT to (7, 9) continues this path perfectly. From there, I can continue moving LEFT to eventually reach (5, 9) first, then drop down to get (5, 8).\n\n**Enemy threat analysis:**\nSnake #1 is still at (1, 4) on the far left side, so they're not an immediate threat to my movement or the apples I'm targeting.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** \nAfter moving to (7, 9), I should continue LEFT to (6, 9), then LEFT again to (5, 9) to collect that apple. After eating the apple at (5, 9), I can move DOWN to (5, 8) to get the second apple in this cluster. This will give me 2 points quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe path looks clear for this strategy, and I'm maintaining good distance from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT"
