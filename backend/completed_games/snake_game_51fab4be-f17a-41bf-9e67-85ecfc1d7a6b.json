Snake #0 is chilling at (2,5) with no body either. \n\nLooking at our options:\n- UP: (6,1) - Safe! Open space ahead\n- DOWN: (6,-1) - DEAD. Off the board, that's an instant fail\n- LEFT: (5,0) - Safe! Clear path to the left\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - Safe! Room to maneuver right\n\nDOWN is immediately eliminated - can't go off the board, that's throwing the game. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all viable safe moves.\n\nStrategic thinking: We want to control the center and cut off Snake #0's access to apples. The apples are scattered but there's a cluster around (4,4), (5,1), and (3,6). Moving UP to (6,1) puts us in position to threaten the center apples while keeping our options open in all directions.\n\nUP seems like the optimal aggressive move - we maintain flexibility while positioning ourselves to dominate the board.

It grabs the free apple at (2,6), boosting score and length, and it keeps us balanced with multiple safe follow-ups. Other moves don\u2019t threaten the opponent or trap us this turn and give less immediate value.\n\nWhy Up over the rest:\n- It yields a growth spike right away, putting us ahead on apples after this turn.\n- It maintains space to maneuver vs the opponent\u2019s potential safeties (they can go to (6,1) or (5,0) or (7,0); none collide with us this turn).\n- It opens a vertical line that can pressure toward the bottom-right region later without cornering ourselves.\n\nLonger-term vibe:\n- With a lead, we can probe for a head-on if it looks favorable, but we\u2019re not forcing it yet. We stay aggressive but smart, using the new body to threaten paths that the opponent would have to mirror, increasing chances of a misstep.\n\nChosen move: UP\n\nUP",

RIGHT is a hard no (that\u2019d be stepping into our own neck at (4,7)).\n- ENEMY SPOTLIGHT: Opponent head at (2,5) with body at (2,4) and (2,3). They can go to (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) this turn. No immediate head-on in sight if we go LEFT.\n- RISK/REWARD:\n  - UP: Keeps us high, but less pressure on him and may open space for apples up top. Safe but less aggressive.\n  - DOWN: Closes the gap toward his row and keeps him in range for pressure, but could trap us if he cuts back.\n  - LEFT: Closes toward the left-side apple cluster (1,7) and (0,7) for quick gain, while keeping options on both sides open. It also pins us along the same x-column, which makes it easier to influence his choices next turns.\n\nDECISION\n- SAFE MOVE ELIMINATION: RIGHT is illegal (we\u2019d crash into our own neck). UP and DOWN are safe but slightly less aggressive given we\u2019re already ahead on score.\n- PREFERRED PLAY: LEFT to (2,7) because it applies immediate pressure, nudges us toward the left-apple corridor for growth, and keeps the door open to swing around and pinch him between walls later.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for the next few turns)\n- Use the leftside apples to grow and extend without losing tempo. Apples at (1,7) and (0,7) are within reach with minimal detours.\n- Push his path toward the edge by staying around x=2\u20133 and y around 5\u20137, forcing him into tighter corridors.\n- Avoid letting him slip into a corner; always keep at least two escape options after every move.\n- If a clean head-on appears and you\u2019re ahead on apples, be ready to trade space for a KO by baiting him into crossing into your line.\n\nFINAL MOVE\nLEFT",

We\u2019re ahead on apples (7 vs 3), so forcing a head-on would seal the win, but that requires a mutual move into the same cell this turn, which isn\u2019t in reach. The safer play is to press toward the enemy to tighten the trap while keeping options open.\n\nDecision process and plan:\n- Step 1: Consider all four directions from (1,5): UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5) (blocked by our own body), RIGHT to (2,5).\n- Step 2: Eliminate unsafe moves: LEFT is illegal (collides with body). UP/DOWN/RIGHT are all safe this turn (not colliding with walls or any snake\u2019s body at the start of the turn).\n- Step 3: Among safe moves, prefer the one that keeps multiple safe follow-ups and pressures Snake #1. Moving RIGHT to (2,5) centralizes us and keeps lanes open to sweep toward his flank, while not over-committing into a dead end.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Step toward the enemy on the right to shrink his escape routes.\n- Keep the left wall barrier and your tail presence to maintain future cage opportunities.\n- If he missteps or we can force a cross-path, aim for a head-on when we can leverage the higher apple count.\n\nCommit to the move:\nRIGHT",

Self-kill!\n  * LEFT: (3,8) - OH NO! That's where Snake #0's HEAD IS RIGHT NOW! Head-on collision - DOUBLE KO!\n  * RIGHT: (5,8) - Clear path, open space ahead\n\nStrategic analysis: We're LITERALLY SURROUNDED! Snake #0 is RIGHT NEXT TO US on the left at (3,8). If we go LEFT, it's a head-on collision and we BOTH die - but they have MORE apples (7 vs 4), so they win that trade! DOWN is suicide into our own body.\n\nWe've got TWO SAFE MOVES: UP to (4,9) or RIGHT to (5,8). Both open up space, but UP gets us to the top edge where we can potentially trap Snake #0 or force them into a bad position. RIGHT opens up the right side but keeps us in the open.\n\nWe need to start thinking about cutting off their expansion routes. UP puts us in a position to potentially box them in from above while we collect more apples on the right side.\n\n**START STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**\nSnake #0 is building that body wall on the left side and they're dominating with 7 apples. We need to catch up to 5+ apples quickly. The top edge at (4,9) gives us a strategic position to potentially trap them while we expand right. Watch for opportunities to cut off their expansion routes when we have the apple advantage. Keep the center open while avoiding their fortress.\n**END STRATEGY NOTE**\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN is suicide into my neck; UP is off-board.\n\nRATIONALE (WHY LEFT OVER RIGHT)\n- LEFT keeps my top-row position but shifts the core away from his left-leaning cluster, buying space to maneuver a cage without immediately colliding with his body. It also preserves my vertical backbone threat without letting him pin me into the corner too fast. \ud83d\udca1\n- RIGHT could tempt a tactical push toward his area, but from (4,9) I\u2019m forced into awkward next moves (only safe option becomes RIGHT to (5,9) or a dead-end), which risks giving him the initiative. I\u2019m better off maintaining control and seeing a couple of moves before committing to a chase. \ud83e\udded\n- With a 7-4 apple lead, I want to maximize pressure and potentially lure him into a head-on setup later, not chase a risky short-term line. LEFT keeps multiple follow-ups available and reduces the chance of an immediate trap.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS)\n- Establish a solid top-edge corridor (x ~ 2\u20133) to steer him toward the left/top portion of the board, where he has fewer escape routes.\n- Don\u2019t give up the vertical safety net; use the top edge to funnel him into a boxy pattern while keeping my own tail out of reach.\n- Watch for ripe apples as leverage to extend while tightening the space around him; aim for a controlled expansion rather than reckless chasing.\n- If an obvious head-on opportunity presents itself (he moves into a line I can collide with), take it to swing the apple count in my favor.\n\nDECISION\nLEFT\n\nLEFT is the move I\u2019ll execute to steady the ceiling, maintain options, and set up the cage without risking immediate self-collision or a reckless chase. Let\u2019s tighten the noose and watch for the next ripe opportunity to pressure him into a mistake. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5",
