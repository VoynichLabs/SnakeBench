Our plan is to DOMINATE this board and box him in!\n\n**IMMEDIATE ANALYSIS:**\n- Board is 10x10, plenty of space\n- Apples are scattered - we need to secure them but more importantly, we need to PREVENT enemy from getting them\n- Enemy is on the right side, we're on the left - perfect for CLOSING IN\n\n**MOVES TO ELIMINATE:**\n- UP: Would move us to (2,4) - SAFE\n- DOWN: Would move us to (2,2) - SAFE  \n- LEFT: Would move us to (1,3) - SAFE\n- RIGHT: Would move us to (3,3) - SAFE\n\nWait... all four directions are safe! Let's think strategically.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We want to cut off the enemy's access to the apples on the right side while grabbing ones on the left.

They're far away for now, but we need to start building our territory. Our score is 0-1, we're behind and we NEED to catch up!\n\nIMMEDIATE ANALYSIS:\n- Board: 10x10, plenty of space\n- Apples: We have apples ALL over the board - (6,3), (8,5), (4,6), etc. We need to start gobbling them up!\n- Enemy: At top-right corner (9,9) - they're in a safe spot but might be going for apples on the right side\n- Our position: (3,3) - center-left side, good for controlling the middle\n\nMOVES TO ELIMINATE:\n- UP: (3,4) - SAFE, not occupied\n- DOWN: (3,2) - SAFE, not occupied  \n- LEFT: (2,3) - SAFE, not occupied\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - SAFE, not occupied\n\nAll four directions are safe!

The apple at (4,6) is also close. But we need to be aggressive about claiming territory. Moving RIGHT to (4,3) puts us closer to the center and gives us access to both the left and right sides. We can pivot either way.\n\nBEST MOVE: RIGHT to (4,3) - this moves us toward the center, gets us closer to apple (6,3), and gives us better board control. From there, we can potentially go UP to (4,4) next turn to head toward (4,6) or continue RIGHT toward (6,3).\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Secure the central apples, build a body to establish territory, then use our size advantage to box the enemy in.

Let's break it down!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SITUATION:**\n- Our head: (7,3), body: [(6,3)]\n- Enemy: head (6,8), body: [(6,9)]\n- Apples everywhere, but we're hunting the enemy!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\nLet's check each direction:\n- **LEFT (6,3)**: Our body is at (6,3)! That's a suicide move - DEAD. \u274c\n- **RIGHT (8,3)**: Open space! Safe. But it's an empty cell with no apple, and we're moving away from the enemy. Not ideal for aggression.\n- **UP (7,4)**: There's an apple at (7,4)! Safe + snack. But wait... if the enemy moves DOWN to (6,7), we might be safe, but we need to think about positioning.\n- **DOWN (7,2)**: There's an apple at (7,2)! Safe + snack. This moves us south, closer to the center but away from enemy.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nWe need to DOMINATE! The enemy is at (6,8), so they're up north. We should close the distance and prepare to box them in. Going UP to (7,4) gives us:\n- An apple for growth (+1 point)\n- Better central positioning to control the board\n- Closer to the enemy's territory for future aggression\n\nBut actually, let's think about the long game... if we go UP to (7,4), we're getting an apple AND moving toward the center. The enemy is up top at y=8, so we're getting closer to them. We want to be big enough to force a head-on collision when we're ahead.\n\n**DECISION: UP** - We take the apple at (7,4), grow to size 3, and position ourselves to dominate the mid-board and pressure the enemy from below. We'll build our body and then close in for the kill!\n\nUP",

This puts us at 3 apples, leading 3-2.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nWe want to be aggressive and dominant. Eating the apple at (5,4) gives us the lead (3-2). This is important because if we force a head-on collision later, having more apples wins the tie-breaker immediately (or puts us ahead if we both die).\nHowever, we need to consider the enemy's position. They are at (7,7).\nIf we go LEFT to (5,4), we move away from the enemy (x decreases from 6 to 5, enemy is at 7).\nIf we go UP, we move toward the enemy.\nThe apple at (5,4) is right there. It's free growth.\nIs there a trap?\nIf we go LEFT to (5,4) (eating apple), our new head is (5,4). Our body becomes [(6,4), (7,4)].\nNext turn, we could go UP to (5,5) or DOWN to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,4) (there's an apple at (4,4) listed!).\nThe apple list has (4,4). That is left of (5,4).\nIf we eat (5,4), we might be able to pivot to (4,4) or dominate the left side.\nBut the enemy is on the right (x=7). We are at x=6.\nIf we go LEFT, we increase distance.\nIf we want to hunt, we should go UP.\nIf we want to dominate and grow, we should take the apple.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nEnemy at (7,7). Body (6,7), (6,8).\nIf we go UP to (6,5):\nNext turn, we can go UP to (6,6).\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (7,6), we are at (6,6). Next turn we could collide.\nIf enemy stays or goes UP, we close in.\nIf we go UP, we are entering the \"danger zone\" where the enemy body is.\nBUT, if we go LEFT (eat apple), we secure a point lead.\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nIf we eat the apple at (5,4), we will have 3 apples vs their 2. That gives us the advantage in a collision.\nHowever, eating the apple takes us AWAY from the enemy.\nWait, looking at the apple list again: (8,5), (4,6), (6,2), (8,2), (2,8), (8,7), (3,7), (9,3), (5,2), (1,9), (8,6), (1,1), (4,4), (1,5), (9,6).\nThere are MANY apples on the right side (x=8, x=9) and some on the left (x=4, x=1, x=2).\nThe enemy is at x=7. They are positioned near the right side.\nIf we go LEFT, we are committing to the left side of the board.\nIf we go UP, we are engaging the enemy in the center-right.\n\nIs there an apple directly in front of us if we go UP? No.\nIs there an apple at (6,2)? Yes, if we go DOWN.\nIs there an apple at (5,4)? Yes, if we go LEFT.\n\nThe board state shows an apple at (5,4) clearly in the visual representation.\n` . . . . . A 0 T . .`\nThis is a guaranteed point.\nHowever, the prompt emphasizes aggression and hunting.\nThe enemy is at (7,7).\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from the fight.\nIf I go UP, I move toward the enemy body at (6,7).\nThe enemy head is at (7,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), they are getting closer to me.\nIf I move UP to (6,5), we are closing the gap.\nIf I move UP to (6,5), and enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), the distance is sqrt((7-6)^2 + (6-5)^2) = sqrt(2).\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4), and enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), distance is larger.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (7,7). I am at (6,4).\nI should close the distance.\nBut closing the distance with no apple in that direction feels like I'm wasting a turn if the enemy just runs away or eats an apple.\nHowever, if I eat the apple at (5,4), I gain the lead. Then I can hunt.\nWait, if I eat (5,4), I grow. My tail extends. The cell (7,3) becomes free? No, my body moves.\nCurrent Body: [(7,4), (7,3)].\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4):\nNew Head: (5,4).\nNew Body: [(6,4), (7,4)].\nThe tail (7,3) becomes empty space.\n\nLet's re-read the \"Aggressive\" requirement.\n\"Be aggressive and be aware of your score compared to the enemy's score. Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI am currently tied 2-2.\nIf I take the apple at (5,4), I am 3-2. I can then be aggressive.\nIf I don't take the apple, I stay 2-2.\nIs there a risk in taking the apple?\n(5,4) is to the left. The enemy is to the right.\nThe enemy can't hit me if I go left.\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4), I have neighbors:\nUP: (5,5) - Empty (Row 5: ` . A . . . . . . A .` -> index 5 is `.`)\nDOWN: (5,3) - Empty (Row 3: ` . . . . . . . . . A` -> index 5 is `.`)\nLEFT: (4,4) - Apple (Row 4: ` . . . . . A 0 T . .` -> index 4 is `.`? Wait. Row 4 is `. . . . . A 0 T . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(4,4) is index 4. It is `.`.\nWait, the apple list has (4,4). Is it on the board?\nRow 4: ` . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: .\n4: . (This is 4,4)\n5: A (5,4)\n6: 0 (6,4)\n7: T (7,4)\nSo (4,4) is NOT an apple on the visual board right now. The list says it dropped there, but maybe it's not there yet or I misread the grid.\nLet's check the apple drops again: `(4, 4)`.\nLet's check the visual grid for Row 4 again.\n`4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\nIt is strictly possible that (4,4) is empty.\nHowever, the apple list is provided by the game.\nIf (4,4) is an apple, then going LEFT to (5,4) puts me next to ANOTHER apple at (4,4).\nIf (4,4) is empty, I just have space.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves.\nEnemy at (7,7). Body (6,7), (6,8).\nPossible moves for enemy:\n- UP (7,8): Occupied by their own body (6,8)? No, (7,8) is empty (Row 8: ` . . A . . . T . . .` -> (7,8) is `.`). Safe.\n- DOWN (7,6): Empty (Row 6: ` . . . . A . . . A A` -> (7,6) is `.`). Safe.\n- LEFT (6,7): Occupied by their own body! (6,7) is a body segment. If they move LEFT, they die.\n- RIGHT (8,7): Is there an apple? Row 7: ` . . . A . . T 1 A .` -> (8,7) is `A`. They could eat an apple!\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7), they eat an apple and grow. They will be 3-2.\nIf I move LEFT to (5,4), I eat an apple and grow. I will be 3-2.\nIf we both eat apples, we remain tied (or I lead if they don't eat).\nBut if the enemy goes RIGHT, they are moving AWAY from me.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving AWAY from them.\nWe would be on opposite sides of the board.\n\nIs there a better move?\nWhat if I go UP to (6,5)?\nI don't eat an apple.\nThe enemy might move RIGHT to eat (8,7) or DOWN to engage.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), and I go UP to (6,5), we are close.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, I am just moving toward an empty space.\nHowever, I am positioning myself to cut off their access to the left side if they decide to come down.\nBut I am giving up a guaranteed point.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is. Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n\"Eat apples\" is a means to an end (dominating).\nIf I can force a collision where I win (because I have more apples), that is the goal.\nCurrently, we are tied. If we crash now, it's a draw or I lose if I'm smaller (I'm same size).\nIf I eat the apple, I am bigger.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4) (Apple):\nI grow to size 4.\nI am at (5,4).\nEnemy is at (7,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), I can move UP to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,4) (my old tail position is 7,4, which becomes empty), I am back in the center.\nActually, if I move LEFT to (5,4), my body is [(6,4), (7,4)].\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), the distance is significant.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Aggressive\" stance.\nMaybe moving UP is the play to force the engagement.\nIf I move UP to (6,5):\nI am at (6,5).\nEnemy at (7,7).\nIf enemy moves DOWN (7,6), we are close.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT (8,7), they eat.\nIf enemy moves UP (7,8), they are safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT (6,7), they die (into own body).\nThe enemy CANNOT move LEFT.\nSo the enemy has 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nIf I move UP, I am signaling aggression.\nIf I move LEFT, I am securing a point.\n\nWhat is the threat of moving LEFT?\nI move to (5,4).\nThe enemy is at (7,7).\nThey can't reach me.\nIf I take the apple, I secure the lead.\nThen next turn, I can hunt them down.\nWith a lead, I can force collisions.\nWithout a lead, a collision is risky.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (6,2) directly below me.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3), I don't eat.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,2) next turn, I eat.\nBut going DOWN takes me further from the enemy (y=4 -> y=2 vs enemy y=7).\nGoing LEFT takes me further horizontally (x=6 -> x=5 vs enemy x=7).\nGoing UP takes me closer (y=5 vs y=7) and keeps x=6 (enemy x=7).\n\nThe board is 10x10. We have plenty of space.\nThe enemy is near the right wall (x=7, max is 9).\nI am at x=6.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving toward the center/left.\nIf I go UP, I am moving toward the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the specific apples.\nThere is an apple at (5,4).\nThere is an apple at (8,7) (enemy neighbor).\nThere is an apple at (6,2) (below me).\nThere is an apple at (4,4) (if it exists).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4):\nI eat.\nMy head is (5,4).\nMy body is (6,4), (7,4).\nThe cell (7,3) becomes empty (my tail moves from (7,3) to (7,4)? No. My tail is (7,3). The body is [(7,4), (7,3)].\nWait, let's trace the body.\nHead: (6,4).\nBody: [(7,4), (7,3)].\nThe tail is (7,3).\nIf I move to (5,4):\nNew Head: (5,4).\nNew Body: The previous head (6,4) becomes neck. The previous neck (7,4) becomes body. The tail (7,3) is shed?\nWait, standard snake rules.\nHead moves to (5,4).\nOld head (6,4) becomes part of body.\nOld body [(7,4), (7,3)] shifts?\nActually, usually:\nNew Body = [Old Head, Old Body[0], Old Body[1]...]\nSo New Body = [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3)]? No, that's length 4.\nWait, we are eating an apple, so we grow.\nWe don't shed the tail.\nCurrent Size: 3 (Head + 2 body).\nIf we eat, Size becomes 4.\nNew Body = [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3)].\nSo (7,3) remains part of the body.\n\nIf I go UP to (6,5):\nNo apple.\nNew Body = [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3)].\nSize remains 3.\n(7,3) remains.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3):\nNo apple.\nNew Body = [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3)].\n\nThe key is the apple at (5,4).\nTaking it gives me the lead.\nThe prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nTo have a higher score, I need to eat.\nTherefore, I should eat the apple.\n\nIs (5,4) safe?\nYes.\nIs there a risk of being trapped?\nIf I go to (5,4), I have space:\n(5,5) is empty.\n(5,3) is empty.\n(4,4) is empty (visually).\n(6,4) is my neck.\nI have plenty of space.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6)?\nNext turn I can move UP to (5,5) or LEFT to (4,4) or DOWN to (5,3).\nI am flexible.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7) (eating apple)?\nThey go 3-2.\nI go LEFT to (5,4) (eating apple).\nI go 3-2.\nWe are tied.\nBut I am on the left, they are on the right.\nI can then chase them.\n\nIs there any move that guarantees a win?\nNo, it's turn 7.\nBut taking the apple is concrete value.\nMoving UP is positioning.\nPositioning is good, but value is better.\nAlso, moving UP brings me closer to the enemy's body (6,7) and (6,8).\nIf I get too close, I might trap myself or get trapped.\nThe enemy has a body at (6,7) and (6,8).\nIf I go UP, I am at (6,5).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (7,8), they are safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6), they are closer.\nIf I go UP, I am setting up to block their descent?\nThe enemy is at x=7. I am at x=6.\nIf I stay at x=6, I block their access to the left side (x < 6).\nIf I move to x=5, I open up x=6 for them?\nIf I move to x=5, and they move DOWN to (7,6), they are at x=7. I am at x=5. There is a gap at x=6.\nIf I stay at x=6 (go UP), I am directly adjacent to their column.\nIf they go DOWN to (7,6), I am at (6,5). Distance is sqrt(2).\nIf they go DOWN to (7,6) and I go UP to (6,6), we are adjacent.\nIf they go LEFT to (6,6), they die (into my body? No, I would be at (6,6)).\nIf I am at (6,6) and they are at (7,6), they are safe.\nIf I am at (6,6) and they move LEFT to (6,6), we crash (double death).\n\nLet's look at the enemy's constraints.\nThey are at (7,7).\nThey cannot go LEFT (6,7) is their body.\nSo they cannot enter my column (x=6) from the right unless they go around or I leave.\nIf I stay at x=6, I am blocking their path to the left side.\nIf I go UP to (6,5), I maintain the blockade.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4), I vacate the blockade.\n\nIs the blockade valuable?\nThe left side has apples: (4,4?), (2,8), (1,9), (1,1), (4,4).\nThe right side has apples: (8,5), (6,2), (8,2), (8,7), (9,3), (8,6), (9,6).\nThe right side is denser with apples.\nThe enemy is on the right.\nIf I block them from the left, they are stuck on the right.\nThe right side is a dead end? x=9 is the wall.\nIf they are stuck on the right, they have to loop.\nIf I block them, I can starve them or force a collision when I am ready.\nHowever, the right side has many apples. They can grow indefinitely on the right?\nLet's see the right side (x=7, 8, 9).\n(8,5), (8,2), (8,7), (9,3), (8,6), (9,6).\nYes, there are apples there.\nIf I let them have the right side, they can grow.\nI should deny them the right side or challenge them.\nBut I am at x=6. They are at x=7.\nIf I go UP, I am at x=6, y=5.\nThey are at x=7, y=7.\nI am closer to the right side apples than I am to the left side apples?\n(6,2) is below me. (8,2) is to the right.\n(5,4) is left. (8,5) is right.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Box him in\".\nIf I go UP, I am pressing against them.\nIf I go LEFT, I am retreating to a different area.\n\"Box him in\" implies pressure.\nMoving UP is pressure.\nMoving LEFT is not pressure.\nHowever, eating an apple allows me to win the collision.\nIf I pressure without an apple, and we crash, I might lose or draw.\nIf I eat an apple, I can then pressure with confidence.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nThere is an apple at (5,4).\nThere is NO apple in the UP direction (6,5).\nThere is NO apple in the DOWN direction (6,3) (visually).\nThere is NO apple in the LEFT direction (5,4) wait, (5,4) IS the apple.\nThere is NO apple in the RIGHT direction (7,4) (it's my body).\n\nSo the ONLY move that gives immediate points is LEFT.\nThe only safe moves that don't kill me are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nRIGHT kills me.\n\nIf I choose UP or DOWN, I am not growing.\nThe enemy might eat (8,7) or (6,2) or something else.\nIf they eat and I don't, I fall behind in score.\nIf I fall behind, I cannot force a head-on collision (they would win the tie-breaker).\nSo, I MUST eat to maintain parity or take the lead.\nTherefore, I should choose LEFT to eat the apple at (5,4).\n\nOnce I eat, I am 3-2.\nThen, next turn, I can be aggressive.\nFrom (5,4), I can move UP to (5,5) or LEFT to (4,4) (if apple exists) or DOWN.\nOr I can move RIGHT to (6,4) (back to where I was, but now I have a lead).\n\nWait, if I go LEFT to (5,4), my body occupies (6,4) and (7,4).\nThe enemy is at (7,7).\nThey are not immediately threatening me.\nI have secured a point.\nI have dominated the board state by growing.\n\nThe only argument against LEFT is \"letting the enemy get away\" or \"losing pressure\".\nBut the enemy is at (7,7). They are far.\nIf I go UP, I am closer, but I don't gain a point.\nIf I go UP, and they eat (8,7), they lead 3-2.\nThen if I chase them, I am chasing with a score disadvantage.\nThat is bad.\nSo, I must eat the apple.\n\nIs there any way the enemy can hit me if I go LEFT?\nNo.\nIs there any way I can trap myself?\nFrom (5,4), I have 3 exits (UP, DOWN, LEFT). (RIGHT is blocked by my neck).\nI am not trapped.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1.  Move LEFT to (5,4) to eat the apple. Score 3-2.\n2.  Next turn, assess the enemy's position. If they are still on the right, I can either chase them or secure more apples on the left (like 4,4).\n3.  With the lead, I can force interactions.\n\nLet's double check the apple at (4,4).\nThe apple list has (4,4).\nThe visual grid row 4 is `. . . . . A 0 T . .`\nIndex 4 is `.`.\nSo (4,4) is NOT an apple on the board right now.\nWait, the apple list is \"APPLE DROPS\". These are apples that are available to be eaten.\nThe visual board shows the current state.\nIf the visual board shows `.` at (4,4), then (4,4) is NOT an apple.\nSo (5,4) is the ONLY apple adjacent to me (actually, (5,4) is adjacent).\nWait, (6,2) is 2 squares down.\n(4,4) is not there.\nSo the ONLY apple I can reach immediately or is adjacent is at (5,4).\nActually, is (6,2) reachable?\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go DOWN to (6,3) then DOWN to (6,2).\nThat takes 2 turns.\nTo eat (5,4), it takes 1 turn.\n(5,4) is better.\n\nWhat about (8,7)? The enemy might eat that.\nLet's verify the enemy's options.\nEnemy at (7,7).\nNeighbors:\n(7,6): Empty.\n(7,8): Empty (Row 8: ` . . A . . . T . . .` -> (7,8) is `.`).\n(6,7): Enemy Body. Blocked.\n(8,7): Apple (Row 7: ` . . . A . . T 1 A .` -> (8,7) is `A`).\nThe enemy can eat (8,7).\nIf the enemy eats (8,7), they become 3-2.\nIf I don't eat, I am 2-3.\nThis is a disaster.\nTherefore, I MUST eat an apple to stay competitive.\nThe only apple I can eat in one move is at (5,4).\n\nDecision:\nMove LEFT to (5,4).\nEat the apple.\nSecure the lead (or tie if enemy also eats, but at least I maintain parity).\nPrepare to hunt.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (6,2)?\nRow 2: ` . . . . . A A . A .`\nIndex 6 is `A`.\nYes, (6,2) is an apple.\nIt is 2 moves away.\n(5,4) is 1 move away.\n(5,4) is the immediate value.\n\nIs there any downside to moving LEFT?\nI move away from the enemy.\nThe prompt says \"Focus on where the enemy is\".\nBut it also says \"Grow as a means of dominating\".\nDominating requires size.\nIf I don't grow, I don't dominate.\nIf I grow, I can dominate later.\nAlso, moving LEFT to (5,4) puts me on the coordinate x=5.\nThe enemy is at x=7.\nThe board is 10x10.\nI am not committing to a dead end.\n(5,4) is relatively central.\n\nLet's consider the \"Box him in\" part of the prompt.\nHow do I box him in?\nHe is at (7,7).\nTo box him in, I need to control the space around him.\nHe is near the right wall.\nIf I control x=6, I limit his leftward movement.\nIf I am at (5,4), I am not controlling x=6.\nIf I am at (6,5), I am controlling x=6.\nIf I am at (6,5), I am NOT eating.\nIf I am at (6,5), and he eats (8,7), he leads 3-2.\nThen he is bigger than me.\nIf we collide later, he wins (or I die).\nIf he is bigger, I cannot force a head-on collision (the prompt says \"if you have a higher score\").\nIf he is bigger, I should avoid collision.\nIf I am bigger, I should force collision.\nSo, to be able to force collision later, I need to be bigger (or equal and lucky).\nTo be bigger, I need to eat now.\n\nConclusion:\nI must eat the apple at (5,4).\nMoving LEFT is the move.\n\nFinal check:\n- Move: LEFT to (5,4).\n- Is it safe? Yes.\n- Does it grow me? Yes.\n- Does it give me a score lead? Yes (3-2 if enemy doesn't eat, or 3-3 if they do eat).\n- Does it allow future aggression? Yes.\n- Does it violate the \"box him in\" immediate tactic? Maybe slightly, but I can't box him in if I'm dead or smaller.\n\nWait, what if I go UP to (6,5) and the enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7)?\nThen enemy is 3-2.\nNext turn I am at (6,5).\nI can try to rush him?\nHe is at (8,7). I am at (6,5).\nDistance is large.\nHe can eat more apples on the right.\nI am stuck in the middle with no apple eaten.\nThis is a losing position.\n\nSo, LEFT is correct.\n\nOne detail: The apple at (5,4) is immediately adjacent.\nIt is free food.\nTaking free food is almost always correct in Snake when it doesn't trap you.\nIt doesn't trap me.\n\nSo, I will go LEFT.\n\nI will write the rationale emphasizing the need to match the enemy's potential score and setting up for future aggression.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (4,4)?\nThe apple list says (4,4).\nThe board shows `.` at (4,4).\nMaybe the list is the set of all apples that exist or will exist?\n\"APPLE DROPS: ...\" usually means these are the apples currently on the board or recently spawned.\nThe board visual is the source of truth for immediate safety.\nThe list is the source of truth for where apples are.\nIf the list says (4,4) is an apple, and the board shows `.`, maybe the board representation is simplified or I misread the row.\nRow 4: `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\nLet's parse this string.\n`4 ` (label)\n`. ` (0)\n`. ` (1)\n`. ` (2)\n`. ` (3)\n`. ` (4)\n`A ` (5)\n`0 ` (6)\n`T ` (7)\n`. ` (8)\n`. ` (9)\nIndex 4 is `.`.\nSo (4,4) is empty.\nWhy does the list have (4,4)?\nMaybe it dropped there but the visual hasn't updated? Unlikely.\nMaybe it's a future drop? No.\nMaybe I should trust the list.\nIf I trust the list, (4,4) is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,4), I am next to (4,4).\nThen next turn I can go LEFT to (4,4) and eat AGAIN.\nThat would be huge!\nSize 5 (2 more apples).\nIf I go UP or DOWN, I am moving away from (4,4) and (5,4).\nIf I go UP to (6,5), I am moving away from these apples.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,3), I am moving away from these apples.\nThe apples at (5,4) and (4,4) are a cluster on the left.\nThe apples on the right are (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (6,2), (8,2), (9,3), (9,6).\nThe enemy is at (7,7). He is close to (8,7).\nHe is likely to eat (8,7) next turn.\nIf I don't eat (5,4), I am letting him eat while I starve.\nIf I eat (5,4), I keep pace.\nIf (4,4) is also an apple (per the list), I have a double apple shot.\nThis confirms LEFT is the best move.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThis is tricky.\nBut it says \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\nI need to grow to dominate.\nI can only grow by eating apples.\nThe apple is at (5,4).\nThe enemy is at (7,7).\nTo dominate the enemy, I need to be bigger or positionally superior.\nBeing bigger helps.\nSo, I will move LEFT.\n\nFinal plan:\nMove LEFT to (5,4), eat the apple.\nScore becomes 3-2 (assuming enemy doesn't eat, but if he does, we tie 3-3, but I secured my point).\nWait, if I eat, I am 3-2.\nIf he eats (8,7), he is 3-2.\nWe are tied.\nBut I have the initiative on the left side.\nHe has the initiative on the right.\nI can then decide to chase him or secure the left side.\nActually, if we are tied 3-3 (assuming he eats 8,7 and I eat 5,4), I am no longer ahead.\nBut I am not behind.\nIf I hadn't eaten, I would be 2-3 (or 2-2 if he doesn't eat, but he likely will).\nSo eating maintains parity or takes the lead.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nIf we are tied, I shouldn't force a collision.\nIf I eat, I might take the lead.\nIf he eats, we tie.\nSo eating is the safest bet to keep the option of collision open.\n\nWhat if I don't eat?\nIf I don't eat, and he eats, I am behind. I lose the collision option.\nIf I don't eat, and he doesn't eat (unlikely), I am tied.\nBut he has an apple at (8,7). It's right there.\nHe will probably take it.\nSo I must take mine.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nRationale:\n- Immediate apple at (5,4) for score lead/parity.\n- Prepares for double apple play at (4,4) (if apple list is accurate).\n- Allows size growth to enable future head-on collisions.\n- Maintains safety.\n\nThe \"box him in\" part:\nI am moving away from him to grow.\nOnce I am bigger, I can return and box him in.\nDominance first.\n\nOne detail: The visual board shows an apple at (6,2) and (8,2) etc.\nWait, row 2: ` . . . . .

A .`\n(5,2) and (6,2) and (8,2) are apples.\nI am at (6,4).\nIf I go DOWN, I can reach (6,2).\nBut (5,4) is closer.\nAnd (5,4) is confirmed by the apple list.\nAlso, (4,4) in the list might be near (5,4).\nThe left side cluster seems valuable.\n\nI will stick with LEFT.\n\nFinal check on constraints:\n- No web searches. Check.\n- Emojis/Rhetorical questions. Check.\n- Plan before move. Check.\n- Last word is direction. Check.\n\nDirection: LEFT.\n\nOne edge case: \"If the enemy crashes into you, he loses.\"\nIf I am at (5,4) and he moves into me, he dies.\nBut he is at (7,7). He can't reach me in one turn.\nSo no immediate crash threat.\n\nOkay, let's write the response.",

We are now at **3 Apples**! We are LEADING! 3-2! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nWe ate the apple at (5, 4). Now we are at (5, 4) with a body of [(6, 4), (7, 4)].\nThe enemy is still at (8, 7). They are VERY far away on the other side of the map (x=8 vs our x=5). They are currently in a position to eat the apple at (8, 7) if they haven't already (the grid shows an apple there, or they are standing on it). If they eat it, the score becomes 3-3. If they don't, we maintain the lead.\n\n**OUR OPTIONS:**\n1.  **RIGHT (6, 4):** This is our body! (The cell we just vacated is now the neck, but our body is [(6, 4), (7, 4)]). Wait, my body is at (6,4) and (7,4).\n    - If I move RIGHT to (6,4), I hit my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n2.  **UP (5, 5):** Let's check the board.\n    - Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .`\n    - Index 5 is `.`. (5, 5) is **EMPTY**. Safe.\n3.  **DOWN (5, 3):**\n    - Row 3: `. . . . . . . . . A`\n    - Index 5 is `.`. (5, 3) is **EMPTY**. Safe.\n4.  **LEFT (4, 4):**\n    - Row 4: `. . . . . A 0 T . .` (Wait, we are at (5,4), so the row is actually indexed 0-9. We are at index 5. Left is index 4).\n    - Looking at the board: `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .` -> Wait, (5,4) is the apple we just ate. We are now the head at (5,4).\n    - (4,4) is to the left. The visual grid shows index 4 as `.`. However, the apple list mentioned `(4, 4)` dropped.\n    - **CRITICAL CHECK:** Did the apple at (4,4) spawn yet?\n    - The board state shows Row 4 as ` . . . . . A 0 T . .` before we moved. After we move, the apple at (5,4) is gone (we ate it). The board state updates dynamically.\n    - However, we don't know for sure if the apple at (4,4) is visible on the *current* frame.\n    - Let's look at the board again. Row 4: `. . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    - (4,4) is index 4. It is a `.`.\n    - BUT, the apple list says `(4, 4)` dropped.\n    - If (4,4) is an apple, moving LEFT is a guaranteed eat.\n    - If (4,4) is empty, moving LEFT is just moving.\n    - Let's look at other apples. (6,2) and (8,2) are on the bottom right. Too far.\n    - (8,5) is an apple. Far right.\n    - **Wait, looking at the board again:**\n    - Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .` -> (5,1) is an apple? No, index 1 is A. (5,1) is an apple. But we are at (5,4). (5,1) is down-left.\n    - Row 4: `. . . . . A 0 T . .` -> We just ate the A at index 5.\n    - Row 4 indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    - Current location: (5,4) [x=5, y=4].\n    - Left: (4,4).\n    - The visual grid shows (4,4) as `.`.\n    - However, the *Apple Drops* list explicitly includes `(4, 4)`.\n    - **Hypothesis:** The visual grid is the *current state*. The *Apple Drops* list is the *potential spawns*. If (4,4) is in the list, it *might* be there.\n    - But usually, the visual grid represents the absolute current state.\n    - If the grid says `.` at (4,4), and it's not our head or body, it's empty (or a wall).\n    - **Let's assume the grid is correct.** (4,4) is empty.\n    - However, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ... (4, 4)\". This implies these apples exist on the board *right now*.\n    - Let's re-read the ASCII.\n    - `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - Wait, if we are at (5,4), that is x=5, y=4.\n    - The row `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .` represents y=4.\n    - The columns are x=0 to 9.\n    - x=0: .\n    - x=1: .\n    - x=2: .\n    - x=3: .\n    - x=4: .\n    - x=5: A (The apple we just ate, or maybe it's still there? No, we ate it.)\n    - x=6: 0 (Our head? No, we are at x=5 now.)\n    - **Wait, the board state provided is from the START of the turn.**\n    - We moved LEFT. So we are now at (4,4).\n    - **Wait, I need to be careful.**\n    - Start of Turn 8: Head at (5,4).\n    - My decision: Move LEFT.\n    - End of Turn 8: Head at (4,4).\n    - Does an apple exist at (4,4)?\n    - The Apple List says `(4, 4)`.\n    - If the grid shows `.` at (4,4), and an apple is *supposed* to be there, the grid might be outdated or I am misinterpreting the visual.\n    - Let's look at the visual grid again.\n    - `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - This is the state *before* I move. (5,4) is the apple 'A'. (6,4) is my head '0'. (7,4) is my body 'T'.\n    - If I move LEFT to (5,4), I eat the apple 'A'.\n    - Now I am at (5,4).\n    - Is there an apple at (4,4)?\n    - The visual shows `.` at (4,4).\n    - The Apple List says `(4, 4)` dropped.\n    - **Conflict:** Grid says empty, List says apple.\n    - In Snake games, the grid is the source of truth for the *current moment*.\n    - However, sometimes drops happen *on* the turn.\n    - If I move to (4,4) and an apple is there, I eat it.\n    - If I move to (4,4) and it's empty, I just move.\n    - **Let's look for other apples.**\n    - (6,2) is an apple. Visual grid Row 2: ` . . . . . A A . A .`\n    - (6,2) is index 6. It is 'A'.\n    - (5,2) is also 'A'.\n    - (8,2) is 'A'.\n    - We are at (5,4).\n    - To go to (6,2): DOWN twice then RIGHT? No, distance is large.\n    - To go to (5,2): DOWN twice.\n    - To go to (4,4): LEFT once.\n    - To go to (4,4) is the most efficient move to potentially catch a spawn.\n    - But is it safe?\n    - (4,4) is empty on the grid.\n    - Let's check neighbors.\n    - (4,4) neighbors:\n        - Up: (4,5). Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .` -> Index 4 is `.`. Safe.\n        - Down: (4,3). Row 3: `. . . . . . . . . A` -> Index 4 is `.`. Safe.\n        - Left: (3,4). Row 4: Index 3 is `.`. Safe.\n        - Right: (5,4). This is where my body will be (neck).\n    - **WAIT.**\n    - I am at (5,4).\n    - If I move LEFT to (4,4).\n    - My new body: [(5,4), (6,4)].\n    - My old tail (7,4) becomes empty.\n    - Is (4,4) blocked by anything else?\n    - Enemy is at (8,7). Far away.\n    - **Is there an apple at (4,4)?**\n    - The prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ... (4, 4)\".\n    - The board visual shows `.` at (4,4).\n    - **Crucial Insight:** The board visual is usually the \"safe\" view. If an apple is listed, it might be a *future spawn* or *current spawn*.\n    - However, if the visual grid shows `.`, it's empty.\n    - **BUT**, look at the Apple List again: `(4, 4)`.\n    - If the visual grid is strictly accurate, (4,4) is empty.\n    - However, the list is provided for a reason.\n    - Let's check the other apples.\n    - (1, 9) is an apple. Top left.\n    - (4, 6) is an apple.\n    - (4, 6) is at x=4, y=6.\n    - We are at (5,4).\n    - (4, 6) is close! Distance is 1 right, 2 up.\n    - If I go LEFT to (4,4), I am at x=4, y=4.\n    - Next turn I can go UP to (4,5), then UP to (4,6) to eat the apple.\n    - This seems like a solid plan.\n    - Is (4,6) actually an apple?\n    - Row 6: ` . . . . A . . . A A`\n    - Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    - (4,6) is index 4. It is `.`.\n    - Wait, Row 6 has an 'A' at index 4?\n    - ` . . . . A . . . A A`\n    - Index 0: .\n    - Index 1: .\n    - Index 2: .\n    - Index 3: .\n    - Index 4: A\n    - Index 5: .\n    - Index 6: .\n    - Index 7: .\n    - Index 8: A\n    - Index 9: A\n    - **YES!** (4,6) is an apple on the visual board!\n    - The Apple List also includes `(4, 6)`.\n    - So (4,6) is definitely an apple.\n    - This is a strong target.\n    - To get to (4,6) efficiently from (5,4):\n        - Option A: UP to (5,5), then UP to (5,6), then LEFT to (4,6). (3 moves)\n        - Option B: LEFT to (4,4), then UP to (4,5), then UP to (4,6). (3 moves)\n    - Both take 3 moves.\n    - However, Option B (LEFT) puts me at x=4, which is directly below the apple at (4,6).\n    - Option A puts me at x=5, requiring a pivot.\n    - **Is there an apple at (4,4)?**\n    - The visual grid shows `.` at (4,4).\n    - The Apple List says `(4, 4)`.\n    - If the visual grid is strictly current, (4,4) is empty.\n    - BUT, look at the board state again.\n    - `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - This is the state *before* my move.\n    - I am moving from (6,4) to (5,4).\n    - The apple at (5,4) is eaten.\n    - Does the apple at (4,4) spawn *now*?\n    - Usually, apples spawn when eaten.\n    - The list `(4, 4)` is in the \"Apple Drops\" list.\n    - This usually means these are the apples currently on the board.\n    - **WAIT.** I need to re-read the prompt.\n    - \"APPLE DROPS: (8, 5), (4, 6), (6, 2)...\"\n    - This list is likely the set of apples currently on the board.\n    - But the visual grid is also provided.\n    - If the visual grid shows `.` at (4,4), and the list says `(4,4)`, there is a contradiction *unless* the apple is there but the ASCII art is simplified or I missed it.\n    - Let's look at the ASCII art for row 4 again.\n    - `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - It is perfectly clear. (4,4) is index 4, which is `.`.\n    - **Conclusion:** The Apple List might be a list of *all potential drops* or *recent history*, but the Visual Board is the absolute truth of the current state.\n    - If the Visual Board says (4,4) is empty, then it is empty.\n    - However, `(4, 4)` is in the list. Maybe it's a drop that hasn't rendered yet?\n    - In Snake game logic, apples spawn immediately when eaten.\n    - I ate an apple at (5,4) (the one listed in the visual).\n    - The list `(4, 4)` might be the *new* apple that spawned to replace the eaten one?\n    - No, usually the \"Apple Drops\" list in these prompts represents the current board configuration.\n    - Let's check the other apples on the board vs the list.\n    - Visual (6,2): 'A'. List: `(6, 2)`. Match.\n    - Visual (8,2): 'A'. List: `(8, 2)`. Match.\n    - Visual (4,6): 'A'. List: `(4, 6)`. Match.\n    - Visual (5,4): 'A'. List: `(5, 4)`? Wait, the list has `(5, 2)` and `(1, 5)` and `(5, 5)`.\n    - The list *does not* explicitly have `(5, 4)`!\n    - Let's check the list again.\n    - `(8, 5), (4, 6), (6, 2), (8, 2), (2, 8), (3, 7), (9, 3), (5, 2), (1, 9), (8, 6), (1, 1), (4, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6), (5, 5)`\n    - **(5, 4) is NOT in the list!**\n    - But the Visual Board clearly shows an 'A' at (5,4) in the grid representation ` . . . . . A 0 T . .` (Index 5).\n    - **This is the key!**\n    - The Visual Board shows an apple at (5,4).\n    - The Apple List is *not* exhaustive of the visual board, OR the visual board includes the apple I'm about to eat.\n    - The Apple List includes `(4, 4)`.\n    - Since (5, 4) is an apple (visual) but not in the list, and (4, 4) is in the list but not visual, I suspect the list is *spawns* and the visual is the *current state*.\n    - Wait, if (5,4) is an apple (visual) and not in the list, I should definitely eat it.\n    - If (4,4) is in the list, is it on the board?\n    - The visual says NO.\n    - If I trust the visual, (4,4) is empty.\n    - If I trust the list, (4,4) is an apple.\n    - Given the (5,4) discrepancy (Visual=Yes, List=No), the Visual Board is likely the correct representation of the physical board.\n    - Therefore, (4,4) is likely EMPTY.\n    - **So, moving LEFT to (4,4) is just a movement, not an apple eat.**\n    - **Wait!** Look at the list again. `(4, 4)` is there.\n    - Why is (5,4) not in the list?\n    - Maybe the list is the set of *new* apples that have spawned since the start, or the set of *all* apples, but the ASCII is simplified?\n    - No, the ASCII is quite detailed.\n    - Let's look at the visual for Row 4 again.\n    - `4 . . . . . A 0 T . .`\n    - (5,4) is 'A'.\n    - (4,4) is '.'.\n    - If I move LEFT to (4,4), I am moving to an empty space (assuming I trust the visual).\n    - **However**, I need to target apples.\n    - Where are the apples?\n    - (6,2), (8,2), (5,2), (4,6), (4,4), (5,5)...\n    - (5,5) is in the list. Is it on the board?\n    - Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .`\n    - Index 5 is `.`. (5,5) is empty.\n    - So (5,5) is NOT an apple on the visual board.\n    - **This implies the \"Apple Drops\" list is a mix of current spawns and maybe future ones or just a log.**\n    - **BUT**, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: ...\". This usually means \"Here are the apples\".\n    - If the visual contradicts the list, the visual is usually the \"current state\" representation.\n    - **Let's assume the Visual Board is correct.**\n    - Current Apples on Board (Visual):\n        - (5,4) - We are eating this.\n        - (6,2), (5,2), (8,2)\n        - (4,6)\n        - (8,5), (8,6)\n        - (9,3), (9,6)\n        - (1,9), (1,1), (1,5)\n        - (2,8), (3,7)\n    - Wait, let's scan the ASCII grid carefully for 'A's.\n    - Row 9: `.

A . . . . . . . .` -> (1,1)\n    - Row 0: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n    - **Okay, the Visual Board is consistent with the List (mostly).**\n    - The List has `(4, 4)`.\n    - The Visual Board does NOT show `(4, 4)`.\n    - **Conflict remains.**\n    - **Resolution:** If the list says `(4,4)` but the board doesn't show it, maybe it's a drop that happened *this turn* and the visual is slightly outdated? Or maybe it's a trap?\n    - **Strategy:** Target apples that are VISUALLY confirmed.\n    - (5,4) is visually confirmed. We eat it.\n    - Next target: (4,6) is visually confirmed.\n    - (6,2) is visually confirmed.\n    - (1,9) is visually confirmed.\n\n    **Let's evaluate moves from (5,4) after eating (5,4):**\n    - **UP (5,5):** Visual shows `.`. Safe. Moves towards (5,5)... wait, is there an apple at (5,5)? List says yes, Visual says no.\n    - **DOWN (5,3):** Visual shows `.`. Safe. Moves towards (5,2) (Apple).\n    - **LEFT (4,4):** Visual shows `.` (if we ignore list). Moves towards (4,6) (Apple).\n    - **RIGHT (6,4):** Into my body. DEATH.\n\n    **Let's compare LEFT vs DOWN vs UP.**\n    - **DOWN to (5,3):**\n        - Target: (5,2).\n        - Next turn: DOWN to (5,2) to eat.\n        - Risk: Enemy is at (8,7). Very far. Safe.\n        - Reward: +1 Apple.\n    - **LEFT to (4,4):**\n        - Target: (4,6).\n        - Next turn: UP to (4,5).\n        - Turn after: UP to (4,6) to eat.\n        - Distance to apple: 2 turns.\n        - Distance to (5,2): 2 turns (DOWN, DOWN).\n        - **BUT**, (5,2) is surrounded by other apples? (6,2) and (8,2).\n        - (4,6) is isolated near the top-left.\n        - **Which direction is safer?**\n        - Going DOWN towards (5,2) puts me closer to the \"center\" of the board (x=5).\n        - Going LEFT to (4,4) puts me closer to the left edge (x=0).\n        - The enemy is at x=8 (right edge).\n        - If I go LEFT, I am moving away from the enemy. This is safer in the long run for a 1v1.\n        - If I go DOWN, I stay in the middle.\n        - **Aggression?**\n        - \"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n        - I am currently 3-2 (assuming I eat).\n        - To force a collision, I need to hunt the enemy.\n        - The enemy is at (8,7). Going LEFT moves me *away* from them.\n        - Going DOWN moves me *laterally* (still x=5, they are x=8).\n        - Going UP moves me *laterally* (x=5).\n        - **Wait, if I want to hunt, I should move towards them.**\n        - But they are very far (distance ~4).\n        - If I move towards them (RIGHT), I die (into my body).\n        - If I move UP (5,5), I am at y=5. They are at y=7.\n        - If I move DOWN (5,3), I am at y=3.\n        - **Is there a benefit to being at x=4 vs x=5?**\n        - (4,6) is an apple.\n        - (5,2) is an apple.\n        - (1,9) is an apple (Top Left).\n        - (9,6) is an apple (Top Right).\n        - If I go LEFT, I commit to the left side.\n        - If I go DOWN, I commit to the bottom/center.\n        - **The Prompt Strategy:** \"Box him in\".\n        - To box him in, I need territory.\n        - The left side is currently free of enemy.\n        - The enemy is on the right.\n        - If I take the left side, I can grow safely.\n        - However, \"Box him in\" implies I need to cut off his escape routes.\n        - With only 3 body segments, I can't box him in yet.\n        - I need to grow.\n        - **Which apple is safer to go for?**\n        - (5,2) is at y=2, x=5.\n        - (4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n        - The enemy is at (8,7).\n        - If I go to (5,2), I am at the bottom.\n        - If I go to (4,6), I am near the top-left.\n        - **Let's check the apple list for (4,4) again.**\n        - If (4,4) is an apple, LEFT is the best move (eat immediately).\n        - If (4,4) is empty, LEFT is just a step.\n        - **Visual Board Authority:**\n        - The visual board shows (4,4) as `.`.\n        - The visual board shows (5,4) as `A` (which we are eating).\n        - The visual board shows (4,6) as `A`.\n        - The visual board shows (5,2) as `A`.\n        - **I should trust the visual board.**\n        - Therefore, (4,4) is EMPTY.\n        - **So, moving LEFT does NOT give an apple immediately.**\n        - Moving DOWN does NOT give an apple immediately (target is (5,2)).\n        - Moving UP does NOT give an apple immediately.\n        - **Which direction has the BEST immediate follow-up?**\n        - **UP (5,5):**\n            - Next turn options: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4-body), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5).\n            - (5,6) is empty (Row 6: `. . . . A . . . A A` -> index 5 is `.`).\n            - (4,5) is empty (Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .` -> index 4 is `.`).\n            - (6,5) is empty (Row 5: index 6 is `.`).\n            - This opens up the center-right.\n        - **DOWN (5,3):**\n            - Next turn options: DOWN (5,2) [Apple!], UP (5,4-body), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3).\n            - (5,2) is an apple. This is a guaranteed +1 next turn if safe.\n            - (4,3) is empty (Row 3: index 4 is `.`).\n            - (6,3) is empty (Row 3: index 6 is `.`).\n            - **This looks promising.** I can eat an apple in 2 turns total (Turn 8: Move, Turn 9: Eat).\n        - **LEFT (4,4):**\n            - Next turn options: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4-body).\n            - (4,5) is empty.\n            - (4,3) is empty.\n            - (3,4) is empty (Row 4: index 3 is `.`).\n            - Target apple: (4,6). It takes 2 turns to reach (4,6) from (4,4) (UP, UP).\n            - So: Turn 8 (Move to 4,4), Turn 9 (Move to 4,5), Turn 10 (Move to 4,6 to eat).\n            - That is 3 turns to eat an apple.\n        - **DOWN (5,3) -> (5,2) is 2 turns.**\n        - **UP (5,5) -> ... no immediate apple.**\n        - **LEFT (4,4) -> (4,6) is 3 turns.**\n\n    - **Comparison:**\n        - **DOWN:** Fastest access to an apple (Turn 9). Safe. Keeps me in the center.\n        - **LEFT:** Slower access to an apple (Turn 10). Moves me to the edge. Safe.\n        - **UP:** Slower access. Center.\n\n    - **The \"Box Him In\" Strategy:**\n        - If I go DOWN, I am at y=2 (bottom).\n        - If I go LEFT, I am at x=4 (left).\n        - To box him in (x=8, y=7), I need to control his surroundings.\n        - Currently, I am at x=5, y=4.\n        - If I go DOWN, I am moving away from him (y decreases).\n        - If I go LEFT, I am moving away from him (x decreases).\n        - If I go UP, I am moving closer to him (y increases).\n        - **Wait, if I want to hunt, should I go UP?**\n        - The enemy is at (8,7).\n        - I am at (5,4).\n        - Distance is 3 in x, 3 in y.\n        - If I go UP to (5,5), distance becomes 3 in x, 2 in y.\n        - If I go DOWN to (5,3), distance becomes 3 in x, 4 in y. (Worse).\n        - If I go LEFT to (4,4), distance becomes 4 in x, 3 in y. (Worse).\n        - **So, UP is the only direction that reduces distance to the enemy.**\n        - The prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n        - \"Grow as a means of dominating the board.\"\n        - \"Be aggressive... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n        - **I am leading 3-2 (after eating).**\n        - I should be aggressive.\n        - I should move towards the enemy.\n        - **UP (5,5) is the aggressive move.**\n        - Is (5,5) safe?\n        - Visual board says `.`.\n        - Is there an apple at (5,5)?\n        - List says `(5, 5)`. Visual says `.`.\n        - If the visual is correct, (5,5) is empty.\n        - **However**, if I go UP, I am closing the gap.\n        - The enemy is at (8,7).\n        - If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,6) or (7,5), we get closer.\n        - If I go UP to (5,5), and Enemy goes DOWN to (7,6), distance is sqrt((7-5)^2 + (6-5)^2) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5).\n        - If I go DOWN to (5,3), and Enemy goes DOWN to (7,6), distance is sqrt(4+9) = sqrt(13).\n        - **UP is better for engagement.**\n\n    - **Wait, is there an apple at (5,5)?**\n    - If (5,5) is an apple, UP is instant growth. Best move.\n    - If (5,5) is empty, UP is just positioning.\n    - **Visual Check:** Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .`\n    - Index 5 is `.`.\n    - So (5,5) is empty.\n    - **So UP is just positioning.**\n\n    - **Let's reconsider DOWN.**\n    - Target: (5,2).\n    - (5,2) is an apple (Visual confirmed).\n    - If I go DOWN to (5,3), next turn I can go DOWN to (5,2) and eat.\n    - This secures a point.\n    - Points are crucial for collision advantage.\n    - \"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\n    - Eating (5,2) brings me to 4 apples vs enemy's 3 (assuming they ate at 8,7).\n    - This gives me the advantage.\n    - **However**, going DOWN moves me AWAY from the enemy.\n    - The prompt says \"Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n    - This implies I should track them, not necessarily move towards them if it's bad tactical positioning.\n    - But \"Aggressive\" implies moving towards them.\n    - **Let's look at the board geometry.**\n    - Enemy at (8,7).\n    - My potential paths:\n        - UP: Towards enemy. No immediate apple.\n        - DOWN: Away from enemy. Immediate apple access (Turn 9).\n        - LEFT: Away from enemy. Slow apple access.\n    - **If I go UP, I am \"hunting\".**\n    - If I go DOWN, I am \"farming\".\n    - The prompt explicitly says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\n    - This is a strong directive to prioritize enemy proximity over apple proximity.\n    - **Therefore, I should move UP.**\n    - Even though (5,5) has no apple, it puts me in a better position to intercept the enemy or cut them off.\n    - The enemy is at (8,7). They are near the top right.\n    - If I go UP, I go to (5,5).\n    - If I go UP again to (5,6), I am at the same y-level as the enemy's body parts (y=7, y=8).\n    - This allows me to threaten the enemy's flank.\n    - **Decision: UP.**\n\n    - **Double check safety of UP.**\n    - (5,5) is empty.\n    - Neighbors:\n        - (5,6) - Empty.\n        - (5,4) - My body (after move).\n        - (4,5) - Empty.\n        - (6,5) - Empty.\n    - No immediate collision risk.\n    - Enemy is far away.\n\n    - **Long term plan:**\n    - Move UP to (5,5).\n    - Next turn, assess enemy movement.\n    - If enemy moves down, engage.\n    - If enemy stays, move UP to (5,6) to close distance further.\n    - Maintain lead (3-2). Force collision when lead is >1.\n\n    - **Final check:**\n    - Score: 3-2 (Lead).\n    - Move: UP.\n    - Rationale: Follow \"Focus on enemy\" rule. Aggressive positioning. Closing distance to enemy (8,7). Preparing to cut off top-right area.\n\n    - **Wait, is there any apple at (5,5)?**\n    - The list says (5,5).\n    - The board says `.`.\n    - If the board is wrong and (5,5) IS an apple, UP is even better.\n    - If the board is right, UP is still the best strategic move for \"Focus on Enemy\".\n\n    - **One detail:** The apple list has (5,5). If this is a recent spawn, it might be there. The visual grid might be a snapshot.\n    - But if I can't trust the visual grid, I'm blind.\n    - I'll trust the visual grid for *safety* (avoiding body/walls) and the apple list for *potential targets*.\n    - But (5,5) is safe in the visual grid. So moving there is fine.\n    - If an apple spawns there, bonus.\n\n    - **Alternative: LEFT to (4,4).**\n    - (4,4) is safe.\n    - (4,6) is an apple.\n    - If I go LEFT, I am moving to the left flank.\n    - If I go UP, I am moving to the center/top.\n    - The enemy is at x=8.\n    - If I go to x=4, I am far away.\n    - If I stay at x=5, I am closer.\n    - **UP is the choice.**\n\n    - **What about (5,2)?**\n    - It's a guaranteed point.\n    - But the prompt says \"Focus on enemy\".\n    - I will sacrifice the guaranteed point for better board control and enemy pressure.\n\n    - **Final Decision:** UP.\n    - **Plan:** Move UP to (5,5). Prepare to engage enemy or cut off top-right.\n\n    - **Wait, check the board for (5,5) again.**\n    - Row 5: `. A . . . . . . A .`\n    - (5,1) is A.\n    - (5,4) is where I am.\n    - (5,5) is index 5.\n    - It is `.`.\n    - Correct.\n\n    - **Check (4,4) neighbors again.**\n    - (4,4) is safe.\n    - But (5,5) is safer position relative to enemy.\n\n    - **One specific check:** The enemy body is at (6,7) and (6,8).\n    - If I go UP to (5,5), I am not threatening them directly, but I am \"upstream\" of them.\n    - If they go DOWN, we might meet at (5,6) or (5,7).\n    - If I go UP, I control the vertical axis x=5.\n    - If I go LEFT, I control x=4.\n    - If I go DOWN, I control x=5 (bottom).\n\n    - **Decision:** UP.\n\n    - **Rationale summary:**\n    - 1. Score lead (3-2). Aggression is permitted.\n    - 2. \"Focus on Enemy\" rule directs movement towards (8,7).\n    - 3. UP is the only direction that reduces Manhattan distance to enemy (from 6 to 5).\n    - 4. Safety is confirmed (empty space).\n    - 5. Future options are open (can pivot left/right/up).\n\n    - **Let's write the response.**\n    - Emojis, rhetorical questions.\n    - Plan: Close distance to enemy (8,7). Maintain lead. Threaten top-right quadrant.\n\n    - **Wait, I should double check the coordinates.**\n    - (0,0) is bottom-left.\n    - (9,9) is top-right.\n    - My head: (5,4).\n    - Enemy head: (8,7).\n    - UP increases y. Correct.\n    - LEFT decreases x. Correct.\n    - RIGHT increases x. Correct.\n    - DOWN decreases y. Correct.\n\n    - **Move: UP to (5,5).**\n\n    - **One final check on the \"Box Him In\" objective.**\n    - Boxing him in means limiting his space.\n    - He is at (8,7).\n    - If I go UP to (5,5), I am not boxing him in.\n    - If I go RIGHT, I would be boxing him in (but I can't, it's my body).\n    - If I go UP, I am securing the center.\n    - If I go UP, I can eventually turn RIGHT to approach him.\n    - If I go LEFT, I am giving him the center.\n    - So UP is better for controlling the center.\n\n    - **Okay, solid logic.**\n    - **Move: UP.**\n\n    - **Drafting the response.**\n    - \"YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT!\"\n    - \"Turn 8!\"\n    - \"We ate the apple at (5,4)!\"\n    - \"Score is 3-2!\"\n    - \"Enemy is at (8,7).\"\n    - \"We need to hunt.\"\n    - \"Options: LEFT (away), DOWN (away), RIGHT (death), UP (towards enemy).\"\n    - \"UP is the only aggressive move.\"\n    - \"Plan: Move UP to (5,5) to close distance.\"\n    - \"UP\"\n\n    - **Check if (5,5) is safe again.**\n    - Visual grid: Row 5, Index 5 is `.`.\n    - Enemy body: (6,7), (6,8).

This moves me closer to the enemy's y-coordinate (y=7) and keeps me in the center to control the board.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe manual says **\"Focus on where the enemy is\"** and **\"Be aggressive.\"**\nIf I go DOWN or LEFT, I'm ignoring the enemy to farm. That's passive!\nIf I go UP, I close the distance. I am **hunting**.\nWe have the lead (3-2). If we force a collision now, *we* win. To force a collision, we need to be in range.\nUP is the only move that respects the enemy's position.\n\n**THE PLAN:**\n1.  Move **UP** to (5, 5).\n2.  Next turn, continue closing the gap or pivot to cut off their escape.\n3.  Maintain the lead and box him in from the center!\n\nLet's hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

Turn 9 and we're still in the lead, but the enemy is on our tail! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**SCOREBOARD:**\n- **US:** 3 Apples \ud83c\udf4e\n- **ENEMY:** 4 Apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- **GAP:** We are DOWN by 1! We need to close this gap fast!\n\n**ENEMY STATUS:**\nSnake #1 is at **(8, 6)**. They are moving down towards the bottom right corner. They are definitely hunting the cluster of apples at (8, 5), (9, 6), and (9, 3). If they eat those, they run away with the lead.\n\n**OUR POSITION:**\nHead: **(5, 5)**\nBody: **[(5, 4), (6, 4)]** (We are growing that tail!)\nLast Move: We moved UP from (5, 4) to (5, 5).\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS & MOVE OPTIONS:**\nI am at **(5, 5)**. Let's look at the grid:\n`5 . A . . . . . . A .`\n(Indexes 0-9: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`)\n\n- **DOWN (5, 4):** This is my **OWN BODY** (the neck). If I move down, I crash into myself. **DEATH.** \u274c\n- **UP (5, 6):** Let's check Row 6.\n  Row 6: ` . . . . A . . . A A`\n  Index 5 is `.` (Empty).\n  Is it safe? Yes, open space.\n  Does it get me closer to apples? There are no apples directly above me, but I'm moving into the center of the map where I can pivot to multiple targets.\n  **Verdict:** SAFE. FLEXIBLE.\n- **LEFT (4, 5):** Let's check Row 5, Index 4.\n  Index 4 is `.` (Empty).\n  Is it safe? Yes.\n  Does it get me closer to apples? Yes! (4, 6) is an apple 1 step up-left. (4, 4) might be an apple (based on the drop list, though the visual was ambiguous last turn, but I need to check the *current* board state).\n  **Verdict:** SAFE. POTENTIAL APPLE EATER.\n- **RIGHT (6, 5):** Let's check Row 5, Index 6.\n  Index 6 is `.` (Empty).\n  Is it safe? Yes.\n  Does it get me closer to apples? Yes! I'm moving towards the right side apples (8, 5) etc., but I'm getting closer to the Enemy's path. This could lead to a head-on collision.\n\n**STRATEGY & DECISION:**\nWe are down 3-4. We need to eat.\n**\"Focus on where the enemy is.\"** The enemy is at (8, 6). To force a head-on collision or cut them off, I need to move East (Right) or South (Down).\n- Moving **UP** to (5, 6) puts me in the center but moves me North, away from the enemy's current Y position (Y=6 vs Y=5... wait, moving UP takes me to Y=6, same as enemy).\n  - (5, 6) vs Enemy (8, 6). We share the same Y coordinate, but I'm at x=5 and they are at x=8.\n  - If they move LEFT to (7, 6), and I move RIGHT to (6, 6), we might clash later.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 5) is a pivot move. It keeps me closer to the center-left apples ((4,6) is an apple I spotted earlier).\n  - However, moving LEFT moves me *away* from the enemy (who is at x=8). This feels passive. We are losing! We need to be aggressive.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nWe are losing. We cannot just farm passively. We need to engage.\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). The closest apple to them is (8, 5) (directly below them) or (9, 6) (directly right).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6, 5):\n- I am moving towards the enemy.\n- I am potentially intercepting their path if they try to loop around the center.\n- I am moving towards the apple at (5, 2) or (6, 2) in the long run.\n- I am maintaining a central position.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 5: `. A . . . . . . A .`\nThere is an apple at (1, 5) and (8, 5).\nI am at (5, 5).\n(1, 5) is LEFT. (8, 5) is RIGHT.\n(8, 5) is exactly 1 step away from the Enemy at (8, 6).\n**HYPOTHESIS:** The enemy is going to eat the apple at (8, 5) or (9, 6).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6, 5), I am setting up to contest the right side.\nIf I move **UP** to (5, 6), I am parallel to the enemy (same Y=6).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need to apply pressure.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I move to (6, 5).\n- From (6, 5), I can attack (7, 5) or (6, 4).\n- If the enemy moves to (8, 5) to eat, I can potentially chase them down.\n- If the enemy moves to (7, 6) (Left), I can chase them to (7, 5).\n\nIf I go **UP**, I move to (5, 6).\n- From (5, 6), I am on the same row as the enemy (Y=6).\n- Distance to enemy: 3 units (5 -> 8).\n- This is a good position to cut off a retreat to the left.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe prompt says: *\"Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"*\nWe have a LOWER score (3 vs 4). So we should NOT force a head-on collision yet.\nWe need to eat an apple to tie or take the lead, THEN pressure.\nWhere are the apples?\n- (5, 2) is DOWN (Distance 3).\n- (4, 4) is DOWN-LEFT (Distance ~2).\n- (8, 5) is RIGHT (Distance 3). **ENEMY IS STANDING ON IT OR ABOVE IT.**\n- (6, 2) is RIGHT-DOWN (Distance ~3).\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I head towards (4, 4) and (4, 6).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I head towards (8, 5) (where the enemy is).\nIf I go **UP**, I head towards (4, 6) (via left turn) or (5, 8) (via up turn).\n\n**Let's analyze the \"Box Him In\" strategy.**\nTo box him in, I need to be on the opposite side of him relative to a wall.\nHe is at (8, 6). The wall is at x=9 (Right) and y=9 (Top).\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 6), I am at y=6. He is at y=6.\nIf he goes RIGHT to (9, 6), he hits the wall (no escape).\nIf he goes UP to (8, 7), he is closer to the wall.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 5), I am far away. He has free roam of the right side.\n\n**ACTUALLY, LOOK AT THIS:**\nEnemy is at (8, 6).\nThere is an apple at (9, 6). (Right of enemy).\nThere is an apple at (8, 5). (Below enemy).\nThere is an apple at (9, 3). (Far down-right).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (5, 6):\n- I am at Y=6.\n- If the enemy eats (9, 6) or moves to (7, 6), I am ready to intercept.\n- I am closing the vertical distance.\n- I am opening up the move to (4, 6) (Apple!) on the next turn.\n\nWait, if I move UP to (5, 6), and the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6), we are at (5, 6) and (7, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 5), and the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 5), we are far apart.\n\n**Let's go for the Apple.**\nThere is an apple at (4, 6). Visual check: Row 6: ` . . . . A . . . A A`. Yes, (4, 6) is an apple.\nTo get to (4, 6) from (5, 5):\n- Move LEFT to (4, 5).\n- Next turn move UP to (4, 6).\n- EAT.\n- Score becomes 4-4.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 5), I am moving away from (4, 6).\nIf I move UP to (5, 6), I am at (5, 6). To get to (4, 6), I need to go LEFT next turn.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), I am 1 step away from the apple.\n\n**Is moving LEFT safe?**\n(4, 5) is empty (Row 5 index 4 is `.`).\nNeighbors:\n- Up: (4, 6) is an apple. Safe.\n- Down: (4, 4). Visual said `.`. Apple list said `(4,4)`. If it's an apple, great. If it's empty, fine.\n- Left: (3, 5). Empty.\n- Right: (5, 5) (Neck). Safe.\n\n**Is moving UP safe?**\n(5, 6) is empty (Row 6 index 5 is `.`).\nNeighbors:\n- Up: (5, 7). Row 7: ` . . . A . . T T T .` -> Index 5 is `.` (Wait, Row 7: ` . . . A . . T T T .`).\n  - Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n  - (5, 7) is index 5. It is `.`.\n- Down: (5, 5) (Neck). Safe.\n- Left: (4, 6) (Apple!). Safe.\n- Right: (6, 6). Row 6 index 6 is `.`.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n- **LEFT (4, 5):** Moves me closer to apple (4, 6). Moves me AWAY from enemy (x=8).\n- **UP (5, 6):** Moves me to same Y as enemy. Opens up (4, 6) as a LEFT move next turn. Keeps me closer to the enemy's X coordinate.\n\nThe prompt says: **\"Focus on where the enemy is.\"**\nThe enemy is at (8, 6). Moving UP keeps me at Y=6. Moving LEFT drops me to Y=5.\nStaying at Y=6 is better for intercepting an enemy moving horizontally along Y=6.\nAlso, if I go UP to (5, 6), I can then go LEFT to (4, 6) to eat the apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 5), I can then go UP to (4, 6) to eat the apple.\nBoth paths lead to the same apple in 2 turns.\nHowever, UP to (5, 6) is more central and aggressive.\nLEFT to (4, 5) is safer but more passive.\n\nLet's look at the score. We are 3-4.\nWe need to play smart.\nIf I go UP, I force the enemy to deal with my presence on the same row.\nIf I go LEFT, I let the enemy dominate the right side.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nI will move **UP**.\nWhy?\n1. It keeps me on the same horizontal axis as the enemy (Y=6), making interception easier.\n2. It opens up a path to the apple at (4, 6) by moving LEFT next turn.\n3. It avoids moving towards the enemy's immediate cluster (Right side) where they might trap me.\n4. It avoids moving away (Left/Down) which ignores the enemy.\n\nWait, let's re-read the apple list.\nApple drops: (8, 5), (4, 6), (6, 2), (8, 2), (2, 8), (3, 7), (9, 3), (5, 2), (1, 9), (1, 1), (4, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6), (9, 0), (5, 1).\n(4, 6) is confirmed.\n(5, 6) is empty.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6), I am in a strong pivot position.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), I am committing to the left flank.\nGiven the \"Aggressive\" and \"Focus on Enemy\" instruction, staying central (UP) is better.\n\nLet's double check safety of (5, 6).\nRow 6: `. . . . A . . . A A`\nIndex 5 is `.`\nSafe.\n\nLet's double check safety of (5, 5) (Neck).\nSafe.\n\nOkay, moving UP.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove UP to (5, 6). Check if enemy ate (8, 5) or (9, 6). If enemy moved to (7, 6), we are close.\nIf safe, next turn move LEFT to (4, 6) to eat the apple and tie the score 4-4.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The enemy is at (8, 5) and they just ate the apple there, putting them at 6 apples! They are growing and moving aggressively. I need to secure an apple immediately.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nMy Head: (5, 6)\nEnemy Head: (8, 5) (Just moved there, likely to eat)\nApple at (4, 6) is still available. It's the closest safe apple.\n\n**SAFETY ANALYSIS:**\nLet's check the move **LEFT to (4, 6)**.\n- Is it on the board? Yes.\n- Is it my own body? No. My body is at (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4).\n- Is it enemy body? No. Enemy is at (8, 5) and his body stretches to (8, 6), (8, 7), etc.\n- Is it safe from the enemy's *next* move?\n  - Enemy is at (8, 5). To hit me at (4, 6), they'd have to move 4 squares in one turn. Impossible.\n  - Enemy might move to (9, 5) or (8, 4) or (7, 5).\n- Is it safe from my *own* tail?\n  - If I eat (4, 6), I grow. My tail currently at (6, 4) stays. So (5, 6) will be part of my body next turn.\n  - Next turn, if I am at (4, 6), I must not move back to (5, 6) if it's blocked... but since I'm growing, (5, 6) will be safe to move through? No, wait.\n  - Actually, if I eat, I grow. The tail does not move forward this turn. So the cell I am currently in (5, 6) becomes the \"neck\". The cell behind that (5, 5) becomes body.\n  - If I move LEFT to (4, 6), my body will be [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4)].\n  - If I then try to move back RIGHT into (5, 6), I would be hitting my own body (the neck). But that's a future problem. For now, (4, 6) is empty space.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe enemy is at (8, 5). They are likely aiming for the apple at (9, 3) or (9, 6) next, or continuing to dominate the right side.\nI am at (5, 6).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4, 6):\n1. I **EAT THE APPLE**. Score becomes 4-6. I close the gap slightly and grow my snake.\n2. I position myself to pivot towards other apples on the left/center ((4, 4) or (2, 8)).\n3. I avoid running directly into the enemy's territory (Right side).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (5, 7): I miss the apple.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5, 5): I hit my own neck and die. \u274c\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6, 6): I miss the apple and get closer to the enemy, risking a collision if they move left.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe need that apple. We need the growth. **LEFT** is the only move that guarantees an apple right now. It's safe, it's smart, and it keeps us alive to fight another day.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (4, 6) to grow to length 5 and score 4. Once grown, pivot toward the center or left side to find more apples, keeping an eye on the enemy's movements on the right. We need to match their score to force a collision on our terms.\n\n**MOVE:**\nLEFT",

No. Enemy body is at x=6,7,8.\n    -   **Is it enemy head?** Enemy is at (7, 5). To hit (4, 7), enemy would have to move 3 left and 2 up. Not happening in one turn.\n    -   **Result:** Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    -   Is it on board? Yes.\n    -   Is it my body? No. (5, 5) is adjacent, but (4, 5) is empty.\n    -   Is it enemy body? No.\n    -   **Is it enemy head?** Enemy at (7, 5). If enemy moves LEFT to (6, 5) and then... wait, no. We move simultaneously.\n    -   If I go DOWN to (4, 5), enemy goes from (7, 5) to... let's say (6, 5). That's safe distance.\n    -   **Result:** Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    -   Is it on board? Yes.\n    -   Is it my body? No.\n    -   Is it enemy body? No.\n    -   **Result:** Safe.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    -   Is it on board? Yes.\n    -   Is it my body? **YES.** My body starts at (5, 6). This is the cell directly behind my head.\n    -   **Result:** DEATH. I hit my own neck. \u274c\n\n**STRATEGY & PLANNING:**\nThe enemy is at (7, 5). They are aggressive. They are likely to go for the apple at (9, 6) or (9, 3), or push left toward me.\nI need to maximize my space and options. I just ate, so I am growing.\nI want to set up for the next apple.\n-   **Apple at (4, 4):** This is available.\n-   **Apple at (2, 4):** Also available.\n-   **Apple at (2, 8):** Available, but further.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\n-   **UP to (4, 7):** Leads to the top wall. Limits upward movement quickly. Not ideal for long-term freedom.\n-   **DOWN to (4, 5):** This puts me directly below my current head. My neck is at (5, 6). If I go DOWN to (4, 5), my body shifts. My tail stays at (6, 4) because I am not eating. My body becomes [(4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\n    -   *Future check:* From (4, 5), I can go DOWN to (4, 4) to eat the apple. That's a strong play.\n    -   *Enemy check:* Enemy at (7, 5). If I go DOWN to (4, 5), and Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 5), we are distance 2 apart. Safe.\n-   **LEFT to (3, 6):** This moves me toward the center/left.\n    -   *Future check:* From (3, 6), I can go DOWN to (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (2, 4) or (4, 4). Good angles.\n    -   *Enemy check:* Enemy at (7, 5). Distance is large.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to prepare to eat the apple at (4, 4) or (2, 4).\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 5)**, I am setting up a straight shot to (4, 4) next turn. This is the most direct line to the closest apple.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 6), I have to navigate around a bit more.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n(4, 5) is currently empty.\nWait, looking at the board provided in the prompt:\nRow 5: `. A . A . T . 1 T .`\nCoordinates: x=0 to 9.\nx=4, y=5 is the 5th index (0, 1, 2, 3, **4**, 5...).\nWait, y=5 is row 5.\n(0,5): .\n(1,5): A (Apple)\n(2,5): .\n(3,5): A (Apple)\n(4,5): .\n(5,5): .\n...\n(7,5): 1 (Enemy Head)\n\nOkay, (4, 5) is empty.\nMy body is at (5, 6), (5, 5)...\nWait. My body includes (5, 5).\nI am at (4, 6).\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 5), I am moving to an empty spot.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 6), empty spot.\n\n**Targeting the Apple:**\nApple at (4, 4).\nTo get there, I need to be at (4, 5) or (3, 4) or (5, 4).\n(5, 4) is occupied by my own body.\n(4, 5) is the best approach.\nSo, **DOWN** is the move to get aligned for the apple at (4, 4).\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy at (7, 5). They are hunting apples at (9, 3), (9, 6), (5, 2).\nThey are likely to move RIGHT to (8, 5) or (9, 5), or UP to (7, 6).\nThey are not moving toward (4, 5).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 5).\nThis is safe.\nThis sets up the apple at (4, 4).\nThis keeps me away from the enemy on the right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (4, 4) next turn to reach 5 apples. Then pivot toward (2, 4) or (1, 5) to continue growing. Maintain distance from the enemy on the right side.\n\n**MOVE:**\nDOWN",

I need to eat to tie it up or take the lead!*\n\n**BOARD SCAN & SURVIVAL CHECK:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 5)\n*   **My Body:** [(4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 4) (Wait, looking at the turn 12 board state...)\n    *   *Correction based on turn 12 prompt:* The prompt says \"Turn: 12 / 150\" and shows the board. Looking at the board for \"1\" (Snake #1), it is at (7, 4).\n    *   *Wait, let me look closer at the prompt text.* \"Snake #1 - Head: (7, 4)\". Yes. The board shows `. 1 .` at row 4. The text confirms Enemy Head is (7, 4).\n    *   *Wait, last turn I analyzed enemy at (7, 5).* The prompt says \"Turn: 12\" and \"OPPONENTS: Snake #1 - Head: (7, 4)\". So the enemy moved DOWN from (7, 5) to (7, 4).\n    *   *Wait, looking at the board provided in the prompt:* The board shows `1` at (7, 4). Correct.\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS (From My Head (4, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is (4, 6) my body? **YES.** My body list starts with (4, 6).\n    *   **RESULT:** **DEATH.** I hit my own neck.\n    *   \u274c **ELIMINATED.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? No. (My body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)).\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it enemy body?\n        *   Enemy Head: (7, 4)\n        *   Enemy Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n        *   (4, 4) is clear.\n    *   **CHECK:** Enemy Head Collision?\n        *   I move to (4, 4).\n        *   Enemy at (7, 4). They can move UP (7,5 - occupied by own body), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), or RIGHT (8,4).\n        *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (6, 4), no collision (distance 2).\n        *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 3), no collision.\n        *   **Result:** **SAFE.** And it lands on the **APPLE at (4, 4)!** \ud83c\udf4e\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? No.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=7,8).\n    *   **CHECK:** Enemy Head Collision?\n        *   I move to (3, 5).\n        *   Enemy at (7, 4). Distance is large.\n    *   **Result:** **SAFE.** (But doesn't eat an apple immediately).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? **YES.** (5, 5) is in my body list.\n    *   **Result:** **DEATH.**\n    *   \u274c **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\n\nI have two safe moves: **DOWN** and **LEFT**.\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 5):** Moves me toward the center. I don't eat an apple this turn.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 4):** Moves me directly onto an apple.\n\n**Why DOWN is the play:**\n1.  **Content is King:** Eating the apple at (4, 4) puts me at 5 apples, tying the score (4 vs 5... wait, enemy has 5. I have 4. 5 vs 5 tie!).\n2.  **Space:** (4, 4) is currently empty. I won't get crushed immediately.\n3.  **Enemy Positioning:** Enemy is at (7, 4). They are far to the right. They aren't threatening me at (4, 4).\n4.  **Future Options:** From (4, 4), I will have eaten, so my tail won't move immediately (growth buffer). I'll have options to go DOWN to (4, 3), LEFT to (3, 4), or potentially RIGHT to (5, 4) (which will be my tail soon, usually safe after growth).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (4, 4) to tie the score 5-5. From there, I need to secure the next apple quickly. The apple at (2, 4) is close by (3, 4) -> (2, 4). Or I could pivot to (1, 5) or (3, 7). I need to keep the momentum and force the enemy into the corner on the right side (x=8,9).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nGo **DOWN**. Get the apple. Get the point. Let's gooooo! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

It's safe, but doesn't set up a quick eat.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 4):** Moves me directly toward the **apple at (2, 4)**. From (3, 4), I can eat it next turn by moving LEFT to (2, 4). This path is clear of my own body and the enemy's position is not threatening this approach.\n\n**Why LEFT is the play:**\n1.  **Content Focus:** There is an apple waiting at (2, 4). Moving LEFT positions me to grab it next turn. Eating is how we dominate the board.\n2.  **Control the Center:** Moving left to (3, 4) keeps me in the center of the board, giving me more mobility than dropping down to the bottom edge.\n3.  **Enemy Positioning:** The enemy is on the far right (x=7). They are currently focusing on the right side. By moving left, I am claiming the left side of the board and forcing them to play catch-up if they want to contest these apples.\n4.  **Avoiding Traps:** Dropping down to (4, 3) is safe, but it's closer to the wall. Staying central at (3, 4) keeps my escape routes open (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all viable options from there).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 4). Next turn, move LEFT to (2, 4) to eat the apple. This will put me at 6 apples, taking the lead. Once I have the lead, I will look to box the enemy into the top-right corner (x=8,9) using my body length. I need to keep expanding my territory while denying them space.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nGo **LEFT**. Set up the eat. Let's take the lead! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Yes.\n    *   **CHECK:** Apple? No.\n    *   **RESULT:** **SAFE.** Just a move. Doesn't get me points.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? No.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it on board? Yes.\n    *   **CHECK:** Apple? No (Apple at (2, 4) was on previous turn list, but likely eaten or moved? Wait, looking at the board state:\n        *   Row 5: `. A . A T T . T T .`\n        *   Row 4: `. . A 0 T . . T . .`\n        *   Wait, looking at the board grid again:\n        *   Row 5 (y=5): `. A . A T T . T T .` -> (2, 5) is empty, (3, 5) is empty? Wait, let's look at the provided \"APPLE DROPS\" list.\n        *   The list ends with (3, 5).\n        *   Looking at the board grid provided in the prompt:\n        *   Row 5: `. A . A T T . T T .`\n        *   Row 4: `. . A 0 T . . T . .`\n        *   Let's map the grid coordinates carefully.\n        *   Row 9 (y=9): `. A . . . . A . . .`\n        *   Row 8 (y=8): `. .

(2, 4) is an apple!\n        *   So LEFT to (2, 4) grabs an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n        *   **RESULT:** **SAFE + EAT.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? **YES.** (4, 4) is the first segment of my body (neck).\n    *   **RESULT:** **DEATH.** Hitting myself.\n    *   \u274c **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have two moves that result in an EAT: **UP to (3, 5)** and **LEFT to (2, 4)**.\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (3, 5).**\n    *   **Pros:** Eats an apple. (3, 5) is currently empty on the grid (Row 5, Col 3 is `.` in the provided grid text, wait let me check the grid text again).\n    *   **Grid Check (3, 5):** Row 5 (y=5) is `. A . A T T . T T .`. Column 3 corresponds to index 3. The string at index 3 is `A`. Wait, `(3, 5)` is an apple?\n    *   Let's look at the provided \"APPLE DROPS\" list: `(3, 5)` is the LAST item in the list.\n    *   Let's look at the board state text again:\n    *   `5 . A . A T T . T T .`\n    *   Let's index this string:\n    *   0: .\n    *   1: A\n    *   2: .\n    *   3: A\n    *   4: T\n    *   ...\n    *   So (3, 5) is an `A`. **Both (2, 4) and (3, 5) are apples!**\n    *   Wait, looking at Row 4 (y=4): `. . A 0 T . . T . .`\n    *   Index 2 is `A`. So (2, 4) is an apple.\n    *   So both LEFT and UP lead to apples.\n\n**COMPARISON:**\n*   **LEFT to (2, 4):**\n    *   Eats apple at (2, 4).\n    *   Moves further Left (away from the enemy at x=7).\n    *   Opens up path to (1, 4) or (2, 5/3).\n    *   However, looking at the board, (1, 4) is empty. (0, 4) is empty.\n    *   **RISK:** The enemy is at (7, 2). They are moving. If they move UP to (7, 3) or LEFT to (6, 2), they are getting closer to the center.\n    *   **FUTURE:** From (2, 4), I can go UP to (2, 5) (empty), DOWN to (2, 3) (empty), LEFT to (1, 4) (empty).\n\n*   **UP to (3, 5):**\n    *   Eats apple at (3, 5).\n    *   Moves to (3, 5).\n    *   **CHECK (3, 5) SAFETY:** Is it my body? My body is (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)... No. (3, 5) is distinct.\n    *   **FUTURE:** From (3, 5), I can go UP to (3, 6). (3, 6) is empty (Row 6: `. . . . T T . . T A` -> Col 3 is `.`).\n    *   From (3, 5), I can go LEFT to (2, 5). (2, 5) is empty (Row 5: `. A . A ...` -> Col 2 is `.`).\n    *   From (3, 5), I can go RIGHT to (4, 5). **DANGER!** (4, 5) is my body! (My body list: (4, 4), (4, 5), ...).\n    *   From (3, 5), I can go DOWN to (3, 4). (3, 4) is my current head, which will be empty next turn (shifting to (3, 5)). So DOWN is safe backtracking.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to avoid getting boxed in.\nIf I go **UP to (3, 5)**, my RIGHT move is blocked by my own body at (4, 5). This reduces my mobility.\nIf I go **LEFT to (2, 4)**, my mobility is wide open: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nHowever, the enemy is at (7, 2). They are far. I need to secure the apple.\nThe apple at (2, 4) is slightly closer to the corner, but (3, 5) is more central.\n\nWait, look at the board state.\nRow 5: `. A . A T T . T T .`\nMy body occupies (4, 5) and (5, 5) (and others).\nIf I move UP to (3, 5), I am adjacent to my body at (4, 5) and (5, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 4), I am at (2, 4).\n(2, 4) is an apple.\n(3, 5) is an apple.\n\nLet's look at the enemy potential moves.\nEnemy Head: (7, 2).\nApples near enemy: (9, 3), (9, 0), (6, 2), (5, 2), (8, 2).\nThe enemy is likely to go for (8, 2) or (6, 2) or (9, 3).\nThe enemy is NOT currently threatening the left side (x < 5).\n\nMy goal is to dominate. I need to eat.\nBoth moves eat.\n**LEFT to (2, 4)** puts me further into \"my\" territory (the left side).\n**UP to (3, 5)** puts me in the center, but restricted by my body to the right.\n\nActually, check my body again.\nCurrent Head: (3, 4)\nBody: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nMy new body will be: (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)\nWait, the tail is (5, 5). It moves forward.\nSo new body: Head (3, 5). Neck (3, 4). Then (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6).\nFrom (3, 5), looking right (4, 5) is occupied by my body.\nLooking left (2, 5) is empty.\nLooking up (3, 6) is empty.\nLooking down (3, 4) is occupied by my neck.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4):\nNew body: Head (2, 4). Neck (3, 4). Then (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6).\nFrom (2, 4), looking right (3, 4) is neck.\nLooking left (1, 4) is empty.\nLooking up (2, 5) is empty.\nLooking down (2, 3) is empty.\n\nMobility is better on LEFT. I have 3 escape routes (Left, Up, Down) vs 2 (Left, Up) on the UP move (since Right is blocked by body).\nWait, on UP move (3, 5), I have Left (2, 5), Up (3, 6), Down (3, 4). That's 3 moves too.\nWait, on UP move, Right is (4, 5) which is my body. So Right is death.\nSo LEFT move gives me Left, Up, Down. UP move gives me Left, Up, Down.\nMobility is similar.\n\nLet's look at apples.\nApple at (2, 4) vs Apple at (3, 5).\nBoth are single apples.\nHowever, (3, 5) is closer to the enemy's potential path (right side).\n(2, 4) is deeper in my territory.\n\nWait, I want to box the enemy in.\nIf I take the left side, I can secure it. The enemy is on the right.\nIf I stay central (3, 5), I am in the mix.\n\nLet's check the \"APPLE DROPS\" list again.\n(2, 4) is listed.\n(3, 5) is listed.\nAre there any other apples?\n(1, 5) is listed.\n(2, 8) is listed.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), I can next turn go UP to (2, 5) (empty) or LEFT to (1, 4) (empty) or check for (1, 5).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am at (3, 5).\n\nLet's consider the enemy.\nEnemy at (7, 2).\nIf they move UP to (7, 3), they are closer to center.\nIf they move LEFT to (6, 2), they grab an apple (6, 2 is in the list).\nIf they move RIGHT to (8, 2), they grab an apple (8, 2 is in the list).\nIf they move DOWN to (7, 1), (7, 1) is empty.\n\nIf the enemy eats (6, 2) or (8, 2), they go to 6 apples.\nI am at 5. If I eat (2, 4) or (3, 5), I go to 6.\nIt is a race.\n\nWhich apple is safer?\n(2, 4) is isolated on the left. The enemy cannot reach it this turn.\n(3, 5) is in the center. The enemy cannot reach it this turn.\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), and the enemy moves aggressively left (unlikely but possible), or if I trap myself.\nLet's look at the board state for (3, 5).\nThe grid shows `A` at (3, 5).\nThe grid shows `A` at (2, 4).\n\nLet's look at the board layout provided.\nRow 4: `. . A 0 T . . T . .`\nMy head is at (3, 4).\nThe apple at (2, 4) is immediately to my left.\nThe apple at (3, 5) is immediately above me.\n\nDecision: I want to control the left side.\nGoing LEFT to (2, 4) secures the apple on the left flank.\nGoing UP to (3, 5) secures the apple in the center.\n\nIf I go UP, I am at (3, 5).\nNext turn, I could go LEFT to (2, 5) or UP to (3, 6).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (2, 4).\nNext turn, I could go UP to (2, 5) or LEFT to (1, 4).\n\nThe apple at (2, 4) is \"my\" apple. It's on the left side.\nThe apple at (3, 5) is contested center.\n\nI will go LEFT. It claims territory on my side.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 4) to eat the apple. Secure the left flank. From there, I will look to move UP to (2, 5) or LEFT to (1, 4) to continue expanding my territory while keeping the enemy pinned on the right.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No.\n    *   **RESULT:** **SAFE.** Moves me further left.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):**\n    *   **CHECK:** Is it my body? **YES.** (3, 4) is my neck (the segment currently connecting my head to the body).\n    *   **RESULT:** **DEATH.** Moving backwards into my own body.\n    *   \u274c **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT. I cannot go RIGHT.\n\n*   **Option: LEFT to (1, 4)**\n    *   This pushes me further into the corner (0,0 is bottom left, so (1,4) is safe from wall but moving towards the left edge).\n    *   From (1, 4), I can still go UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), or LEFT (0,4).\n    *   However, looking at the board, (1, 5) has an apple (from the \"APPLE DROPS\" list).\n    *   (1, 1) also has an apple.\n    *   (0, 0) has an apple.\n    *   Going LEFT keeps me in the \"left side territory\" where apples are clustered.\n    *   The enemy is on the far right (x=6+). They are not a threat to the left side right now.\n    *   Going LEFT to (1, 4) sets me up perfectly to grab the apple at (0, 4) next turn if it's still there, or pivot up to (1, 5) to chase the apple cluster at (1, 5) and (1, 9).\n\n*   **Option: UP to (2, 5) / DOWN to (2, 3)**\n    *   These keep me at x=2.\n    *   (2, 5) is empty.\n    *   (2, 3) is empty.\n    *   From (2, 5), I can eventually go to (2, 8) for an apple.\n    *   However, (2, 8) is far. The left side (x=0,1) has immediate apples.\n    *   Staying at x=2 leaves the \"left pocket\" (x=0,1) potentially open for the enemy to sneak into later (though unlikely immediately).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to dominate the board. The left side has apples at (1, 5), (1, 1), (0, 0). The bottom left corner is rich with resources.\nBy moving **LEFT to (1, 4)**, I am claiming the column closest to the wall.\nFrom (1, 4), I have excellent options:\n1.  Go LEFT to (0, 4) to claim the edge.\n2.  Go UP to (1, 5) to chase the apple at (1, 5).\n3.  Go DOWN to (1, 3) to head towards the apple at (1, 1).\n4.  Go DOWN to (1, 3), then LEFT to (0, 3), then DOWN to (0, 2) or (0, 1) or (0, 0).\n\nMoving RIGHT is death.\nMoving UP or DOWN keeps me in the open, but **LEFT** forces me into a corner where I can loop around and control the perimeter. The enemy is far right. I should claim the far left.\n\nI'm securing the perimeter, Chat! I'm boxing the board in from the left side.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 4) to secure the left perimeter. From there, I will sweep downwards or upwards depending on where the enemy moves, aiming to collect the apples at (1, 1) or (0, 0) or (1, 5). I am cutting off the board from the left, forcing the enemy into the right side.\n\nLEFT",

They were at (5, 2) and now they're at (2, 2)? That means they moved **LEFT** twice in a row? Or did they teleport?

It secures a point and keeps me flexible.\n    *   The enemy is moving simultaneously. Where could they go?\n        *   From (5, 2), they have (5, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), (5, 1).\n        *   (5, 1) is an apple. They might go for it.\n        *   (6, 2) is their body (neck). They can't go there.\n        *   (5, 3) is empty.\n        *   (4, 2) is empty.\n    *   They are not an immediate threat to me at (1, 4) or (1, 5).\n    *   I need to close the score gap. 6 vs 7. An apple brings me to 7.\n    *   Let's check if (1, 5) is safe from the enemy *simultaneously*.\n        *   The enemy is at (5, 2). The distance is huge. They cannot reach (1, 5) in one turn.\n        *   So (1, 5) is safe from collision.\n    *   Is (1, 5) safe from my own future self?\n        *   If I go UP to (1, 5), my body moves. The tail at (5, 6) might move if I don't eat. BUT I am eating an apple! So I grow. The tail does not move. The new head is (1, 5). The old head (1, 4) becomes part of the body.\n        *   My body becomes: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)].\n        *   This is safe.\n\n5.  **Comparison:**\n    *   **UP:** Eat apple. Score becomes 7-7 (Tied). Grow. Keep options open.\n    *   **LEFT:** Go to (0, 4). No apple. Score stays 6-7. No growth.\n    *   **DOWN:** Go to (1, 3). No apple. Score stays 6-7. No growth.\n\n    *   Aggression means taking the apple to tie the score and prepare for a takeover. The left side is safe, but the apple is *right there*.\n\n6.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Move UP to (1, 5).\n    *   Is (1, 5) occupied by an enemy snake body?\n        *   Enemy body: (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6).\n        *   No.\n    *   Is (1, 5) occupied by my body?\n        *   No.\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n\n    *   **HYPOTHETICAL ENEMY MOVE:**\n        *   If they go UP to (5, 3): Safe for them.\n        *   If they go DOWN to (5, 1): They eat an apple. They go to 8 apples. I need to eat too.\n        *   If they go LEFT to (4, 2): Safe.\n\n    *   I must eat to keep up. The apple is there. I take it.\n\n**PLAN:**\nEat the apple at (1, 5) to tie the score 7-7. Secure the left flank territory. From (1, 5), I can continue up towards (1, 6) and (1, 9) for the next apple, or branch out. The enemy is bottom-right, I am top-left. We are mapping the board. Eating now prevents them from getting too far ahead.\n\nUP",

We are currently tied at 7-7 in apples, but the enemy is slightly ahead in total score if they grabbed one last turn? Wait, let me check the score.\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n*   **Me (ID 0):** 7 Apples.\n*   **Enemy (ID 1):** 8 Apples.\n\n**THE REPLAY CHECK:**\nLast turn, I moved UP to (1, 5) and grabbed that apple!\n*   **My Score:** 7 Apples.\n*   **Enemy Score:** 8 Apples.\n*   *Wait*, the scoreboard in the prompt shows Enemy has 8 and I have 7 *before* this turn's move. Did the enemy grab an apple on Turn 16? Yes! They moved to (5, 1) which was an apple.\n*   Now we are at Turn 17. I need to catch up.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS (Turn 17):**\n*   **My Position:** Head at **(1, 5)**.\n    *   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3)... wait, let's look at the visual board.]\n    *   **Visual Board Row 5:** `A 0 . A T . . T T A`\n    *   x=0: Apple\n    *   x=1: **0** (Me!)\n    *   x=2: Empty\n    *   x=3: Apple\n    *   x=4: T (Body at (4, 5)?)\n    *   x=5: Empty\n    *   x=6: Empty\n    *   x=7: T\n    *   x=8: T\n    *   x=9: Apple\n\n    *   **Body Check:** My body is behind me at **(1, 4)**.\n    *   **Other Body Parts:** I see T's at (4, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5).\n    *   Wait, looking at my previous body list: `[(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]`.\n    *   Since I just ate an apple at (1, 5) last turn, my tail **did not move**.\n    *   So my body is now: `[(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]`.\n    *   However, the visual board shows a `T` at (4, 5). This matches `(4, 5)` in my body list.\n    *   The visual board shows a `T` at (7, 5) and (8, 5). These belong to the **ENEMY**.\n\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at **(5, 1)** (based on the Turn 16 board visualization and the fact they likely ate the apple there).\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt says \"Turn: 17 / 150\" and gives the board state. Let's look at the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 17.\n    *   **Row 1:** `. A . . . 1 . . . .`\n    *   This shows the Enemy Head at **(5, 1)**.\n    *   Their body: `[(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]`.\n    *   Visual board confirms `T`'s at (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2) on row 2, and (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5) on row 3/4/5, etc.\n\n*   **Apple Spots (Visible on Board):**\n    *   (0, 0) - Bottom Left\n    *   (0, 5) - Left of me!\n    *   (3, 5) - 2 steps right of me\n    *   (1, 1) - Down-left\n    *   (5, 9) - Top Right (Row 9 shows A at x=5)\n    *   (8, 6) - Top Right\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Location:** (1, 5).\n2.  **Analyze Moves:**\n    *   **UP to (1, 6):**\n        *   Is it an apple? No (Visual check: Row 6, x=1 is empty, `.`).\n        *   Is it my body? No. (My body: (1, 4) is directly below, (2, 4) is diagonal down-right).\n        *   Is it enemy body? No. (Enemy is at x=5+).\n        *   **Safety:** SAFE.\n    *   **DOWN to (1, 4):**\n        *   Is it an apple? No.\n        *   Is it my body? **YES.** (This is my neck. I came from here last turn).\n        *   **Safety:** **DEATH**.\n    *   **LEFT to (0, 5):**\n        *   Is it an apple? **YES!** Visual check Row 5: `A 0 ...`. (0, 5) is an apple.\n        *   Is it my body? No.\n        *   Is it enemy body? No.\n        *   **Safety:** **SAFE + GROWTH**.\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n        *   Is it an apple? No (Row 5: `... 0 . A ...`. (2, 5) is empty).\n        *   Is it my body? No.\n        *   Is it enemy body? No.\n        *   **Safety:** SAFE.\n\n3.  **Aggression & Score:**\n    *   I am down 7-8. I NEED an apple to tie.\n    *   **LEFT** gives me an apple immediately. Score becomes 8-8.\n    *   **UP** or **RIGHT** do not give an apple.\n\n4.  **Enemy Threat Analysis:**\n    *   Enemy is at (5, 1). They are looking at apples at (5, 9) or (3, 5) or (0, 5) or (0, 0).\n    *   If they move towards (3, 5), they come closer to me.\n    *   If I take (0, 5), I secure the left flank and block them from that apple.\n\n5.  **Future Moves (from potential spots):**\n    *   If I go **LEFT to (0, 5)**:\n        *   I eat the apple. I grow. Tail stays at (5, 6).\n        *   My head is at (0, 5).\n        *   Next moves: (0, 6), (0, 4), or (1, 5) [backwards].\n        *   (0, 6) is open. (0, 4) is open.\n        *   This opens up the entire left side of the board (x=0).\n    *   If I go **UP to (1, 6)**:\n        *   No apple.\n        *   Head at (1, 6).\n        *   Next moves: (1, 7), (0, 6), (2, 6).\n        *   (1, 7) is open.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT to (2, 5)**:\n        *   No apple.\n        *   Head at (2, 5).\n        *   Next moves: (2, 6), (3, 5), (1, 5).\n        *   (3, 5) is an apple! This is a good path too.\n        *   *However*, (3, 5) is closer to the enemy. If I go RIGHT now, I might end up facing the enemy head-on next turn if they move UP/RIGHT.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I pull the enemy towards the left side if they want to contest the apple, or I secure it and move up while they are on the right.\n\n6.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I am currently winning on board control. The enemy is bottom-right.\n    *   Taking the apple at (0, 5) ties the score.\n    *   From (0, 5), I can move UP to (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9).\n    *   There are apples at (0, 0) and (0, 5) taken.\n    *   Let's check Row 9: `. A . . . A . . A .` (Wait, the prompt shows Row 9: `9 . A . . . A . . .`).\n    *   (1, 9) is an apple. (5, 9) is an apple.\n    *   From (0, 5) UP, I can head towards the top left corner.\n    *   The enemy is trapped on the bottom right.\n    *   **Force the collision:** I have 7 apples. If I eat now, I have 8.\n    *   If I can get to the top left, I can dominate that corner.\n    *   The most aggressive move to secure a resource and block the enemy's path to the left side is **LEFT**.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nMove **LEFT** to (0, 5). Eat the apple. Tie the score 8-8. Open up the left column for vertical movement. Keep the pressure on.\n\nLEFT",

Now we gotta keep the pressure on.\n\nLet's look at the board. My head is at **(0, 5)** after that tasty left move.\n*   **My Body:** My tail is still at **(5, 6)** because I ate an apple last turn. So my body runs from (0, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at **(4, 1)**. Their body runs right and up towards (7, 5). They are creeping closer to the center.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVES FROM (0, 5):**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 4):**\n    *   Check board: Row 4, col 0 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Check my body: Is (0, 4) part of my body? No. My body is at (1, 4), (2, 4), etc.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe. But... where does it lead? (0, 3) and (0, 2) are empty. (0, 1) has an apple, but (0, 0) has an apple too. It's a long tunnel.\n\n2.  **UP to (0, 6):**\n    *   Check board: Row 6, col 0 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Check my body: (0, 6) is not in my body list.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe. This leads up the left wall. Row 7, col 0 is empty. Row 8, col 0 is empty. Row 9, col 0 is empty. It's a clear shot to the top.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 5):**\n    *   Check board: Row 5, col 1 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   **DEATH CHECK:** My body is immediately to the right? No. But wait, my body is **(1, 5)**! That's the cell I just came from (or rather, the cell connecting my head to my body).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** puts my head into **(1, 5)**, which is currently occupied by my own body segment.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n4.  **LEFT to (-1, 5):**\n    *   Check board: x = -1 is off the grid.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm tied on apples (8-8). The enemy is at (4, 1). They are likely going for the apples in the bottom right or center.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I'm walking into the corner. (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1). I'll eat the apple at (0, 1) eventually, but I might get trapped if the enemy comes up the right side.\nIf I go **UP**, I claim the entire left column. (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9). I can dominate the top-left corner.\nThe board shows apples at **(6, 9)** and **(8, 6)** on the right side, and **(0, 0)** on the bottom left.\nThe enemy is on the right. Let them fight for the right side. I will take the left side and the top.\n\n**Plan:** Secure the left flank. Move UP to (0, 6). This keeps my path open to the top of the board where there are apples ((6, 9) is accessible from the top edge).\n\nUP",

The enemy is at (3,1) and their body goes up to (7,5). They are moving into the lower/middle right area. I should avoid them.\n\nThe plan is to dominate the left flank and the top. Going **UP** is the safest, most aggressive play to claim territory. I'm already at the edge, so expanding upwards is free real estate.\n\n**Plan:** Continue claiming the left edge. Move UP to (0, 7). Next turn I can likely go UP to (0, 8) or (0, 9), or maybe RIGHT into the top row to start looping. This keeps my options open and forces the enemy to deal with me later.\n\nUP",

He's creeping in the lower right, but his body is mostly blocking the right edge. I need to keep the pressure on and claim my territory.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES FROM (0, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 8):**\n    *   Board: Row 8, col 0 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   My Body: (0, 8) is NOT in my body.\n    *   **Verdict:** **SAFE.** \ud83d\ude80 This is the play. I continue dominating the left edge and push towards the top-left corner. I'm boxing myself in? No, I'm boxing *him* out! I'm claiming the entire left side of the board. If he wants to fight, he has to come to me.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 6):**\n    *   Board: Row 6, col 0 is `T` (My tail was there last turn).\n    *   Wait, let's check my body. My body is `[(0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]`. Since I ate an apple on Turn 18, my tail was at (5, 6). After moving UP to (0, 7), my tail moves forward. The new tail is now at (0, 6).\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udc80 I would be moving back into my own body segment. That's a self-crash. Absolutely not.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 7):**\n    *   Board: Row 7, col 1 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   My Body: (1, 7) is NOT in my body.\n    *   **Verdict:** Safe. But this moves me into the open space. The enemy is at (2, 1) and his body stretches to (7, 4). He's down low. If I go RIGHT, I'm moving towards the center, but I might be walking into his path if he decides to push up. Going UP is safer and more aggressive for map control.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (-1, 7):**\n    *   Board: Off the grid.\n    *   **Verdict:** **DEATH.** \ud83d\udeab\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI'm playing the long game here. The enemy is stuck in the bottom right. By going **UP** to (0, 8), I claim the entire left side of the board. I'm creating a massive barrier. My body will snake up the left wall, effectively splitting the board in half. He has to either go around the top or the bottom to get to me. If he tries to head-on collision me while I'm on the wall, he's gonna crash into my body.\n\nThere's an apple at (1, 9) and (6, 9) up top. By claiming the left wall, I'm in perfect position to sweep those apples while keeping him trapped in the lower right quadrant. I'm forcing him to play my game.\n\n**Plan:** Continue UP to (0, 8), then (0, 9). Once I hit the top, I can start sweeping right along row 9. I'm going to slowly squeeze him out of existence. He wants to box me in? I'm already boxing him in from the outside. Let's see if he can handle the pressure.\n\nUP",

Let's check the board and plan the trap.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions from my current head (0, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 9)\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 7)\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 8)\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 8)\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE moves that would kill me:**\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 8):** Off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN (0, 7):** Looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n        ```\n         9 . A . . . . A . . .\n         8 0 . A . . . A . . .\n         7 T . . A . . A . . .\n        ```\n        My body is represented by `T` in row 7. Specifically, `T` is at (0, 7). Since my head moves into (0, 7), that is part of my own body. **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 8):**\n        *   Board: Row 8, col 1 is `.` (Empty).\n        *   My Body: (1, 8) is NOT in my body list.\n        *   Enemy: Enemy is at (1, 1), far away. No enemy body at (1, 8).\n        *   **SAFE.**\n    *   **UP (0, 9):**\n        *   Board: Row 9, col 0 is `.` (Empty).\n        *   My Body: (0, 9) is NOT in my body list.\n        *   Enemy: Far away.\n        *   **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Analyze SAFE moves (UP and RIGHT):**\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (1, 8):** This moves into the center of the board. However, I need to be aggressive and box in the enemy. The enemy is at (1, 1) with a long body stretching to the right. If I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy's current position but potentially into the path of his future expansion. More importantly, I am already on the left wall. Moving right gives up my positional advantage of the wall.\n    *   **Move UP to (0, 9):** This is the top-left corner. By moving here, I secure the corner. I am now at the top of the board. From (0, 9), I have options: RIGHT to (1, 9) (which has an apple) or DOWN to (0, 8) (which will be empty when I leave it). This position gives me the highest visibility and control over the upper-left quadrant. The enemy is at the bottom right. If I take the top row, I can sweep apples and force the enemy to come up to me if he wants to contest. If he comes up, he has to cross my path or my body. If I stay on the wall, I am hard to kill.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI need to grow. There is an apple at (1, 9). To get it, I need to be at (1, 9) or adjacent to it. Going UP to (0, 9) puts me directly adjacent to (1, 9). Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (1, 9) and eat the apple, growing to length 10 and scoring a point to tie the game 9-9.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (1, 8), I am not eating an apple immediately, and I am moving into the open where the enemy might flank me. The enemy is at (1, 1) and his body is to the right. He is likely to move UP or LEFT to avoid his own body or chase apples. But he is far away.\n\nThe most important factor is **map control**. By taking the corner (0, 9), I claim the top edge. The enemy is stuck in the bottom right. If I can secure the top and sweep apples there, I can win by points. If the enemy tries to challenge me in the top left, he has to travel across the board, which puts him in danger of head-on collisions if I position my body correctly.\n\nI will choose **UP**.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1.  Turn 21: Move UP to (0, 9). Secure the corner.\n2.  Turn 22: Move RIGHT to (1, 9). Eat the apple. Tie score 9-9. Grow to length 10.\n3.  Turn 23: Move RIGHT to (2, 9). Continue sweeping the top row. Force the enemy to stay low while I dominate the high ground.\n\nUP",

My opponent is chilling at the bottom right, but I'm about to sweep the top row and force him into a corner. Here's the play-by-play.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Consider ALL four directions from my current head (0, 9):**\n    *   **UP:** (0, 10) -> Off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 8) -> This is where my neck was. It's empty now. **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 9) -> **THERE IS AN APPLE HERE (1, 9)!** Board shows `A`. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 9) -> Off the board. **DEAD.**\n\n2.  **ELIMINATE moves that would kill me:**\n    *   UP and LEFT are immediate deaths (off board).\n    *   DOWN is safe, but moving back to (0, 8) wastes a turn. I don't gain territory, and I don't score.\n    *   RIGHT moves me to (1, 9). Let's check collisions:\n        *   **My Body:** My body is currently at [(0, 8), (0, 7)...]. (1, 9) is not in this list.\n        *   **Enemy Body:** Snake #1 is at the bottom [(1, 1), (2, 1)...]. (1, 9) is clear.\n        *   **Head-on Collision?** I need to predict where the enemy moves. Snake #1 is at (0, 1). He is surrounded by his own body to the right and apples/open space above and left. He likely won't move to (1, 9) because he is too far away to reach it in one turn. Even if he tries to go UP, he'll be at (0, 2) or (1, 2). No threat.\n\n3.  **Analyze SAFE moves:**\n    *   **DOWN to (0, 8):** Safe, but passive. I stay on the wall but give up the apple at (1, 9). This allows the enemy to catch up or eat other apples while I stagnate.\n    *   **RIGHT to (1, 9):** This is the winning move. I eat the apple, grow to length 10, and tie the score 9-9. More importantly, I secure the top-right quadrant. From (1, 9), I can move DOWN or RIGHT next turn, keeping my escape routes open.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nThe plan is simple: **Domination.**\n1.  **Turn 22:** Move RIGHT to (1, 9). Eat the apple. **TIE THE SCORE (9-9).**\n2.  **Turn 23:** From (1, 9), I will likely move RIGHT to (2, 9) to continue sweeping the top edge or DOWN to (1, 8) to cut off the center.\n3.  **Trap:** By taking the top edge, I force the enemy to stay low. If he tries to come up, he has to cross my path. If I keep growing, I can eventually box him in against the bottom wall.\n\nI need that apple to stay in the game. It's right there. Let's take it!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me check the scoreboard again...\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Status Check:**\n    *   **My Score:** The scoreboard says I have **9 apples**. The opponent has **10 apples**. They are winning by 1.\n    *   **My Position:** My head is at **(1, 9)**. My body follows: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]. I am on the top edge.\n    *   **Opponent Position:** Snake #1 is at **(0, 0)** with a long body stretching up the left side and across the bottom. They are far away from me physically, but leading in score.\n    *   **Board State:** There is an apple at **(2, 9)** (Top row, 3rd column). There is also an apple at **(8, 2)** and **(9, 3)**, but those are far in the bottom right.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from (1, 9):**\n    *   **UP (1, 10):** Off the board. **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT (0, 9):** This is my neck/body. Moving backwards into my own body is suicide. **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN (1, 8):**\n        *   *Safety:* Empty space. Safe.\n        *   *Value:* Moves me toward the center but away from the immediate apple at (2, 9). It opens up connections to the bottom half.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 9):**\n        *   *Safety:* The board shows `A` (Apple). It is empty of snakes.\n        *   *Value:* **THERE IS AN APPLE HERE!** If I move here, I eat it, grow to length 10, and score a point. This brings me to 10 apples, TIEING the score 10-10!\n\n3.  **Opponent Prediction:**\n    *   The enemy is at (0, 0). Their options are likely UP (0, 1 - currently blocked by their own body at (0, 1)? Wait, their body is [(0, 1), (1, 1)...]. So (0, 1) is occupied by their own neck. They cannot go UP to (0, 1).\n    *   Their only viable moves are likely RIGHT (1, 0) or DOWN (0, -1 - dead). They are trapped in the corner. They are not a threat to me at the top right corner. They are essentially boxed in by their own body.\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I am trailing 9-10.\n    *   There is an apple literally one step to my right.\n    *   Taking it ties the score and extends my length, giving me better board control on the top edge.\n    *   Moving DOWN is safe but ignores the scoring opportunity. Given the opponent is stuck in the bottom left corner (snake #1 is at (0, 0) and his body blocks his exit), I have time. But I need points to win.\n\n**The Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (2, 9) immediately. Tie the score. From (2, 9), I can then plan to sweep the top row or descend into the center to cut off the enemy's expansion (though they look pretty stuck). We need to be aggressive because we are losing on the scoreboard!\n\nMoving RIGHT to get that apple! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

My head is at (2, 9) (let's assume I just moved RIGHT last turn as planned\u2014I need to confirm my position based on the \"Replay\" but the board state says \"My Head: (2, 9)\" which matches the REPLAY end state. Actually, wait. The Replay says I moved from (1,9) to (2,9). The board state provided at the start of this turn says \"Head: (2, 9)\". Okay, we are locked in.\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   **Score:** Me (9) vs Enemy (10). I am losing. \ud83d\udea8\n*   **Position:** Head at (2, 9). Body is [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8)...]. I am on the top row.\n*   **Enemy:** Head at (1, 0). He is far away, stuck in the bottom left. He is not a threat to me *right now*, but he has more apples and needs to be shut down.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (2, 9):**\n1.  **UP (2, 10):** Off the board. Dead. \u274c\n2.  **LEFT (1, 9):** That's my body. Moving backwards into myself is suicide. Dead. \u274c\n3.  **RIGHT (3, 9):** Let's check the board state.\n    *   `Board Row 9: \"9 T T 0 . . . A . . .\"`\n    *   Indices: 0=T, 1=T, 2=0 (Me), 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=A, 7=., 8=., 9=.\n    *   (3, 9) is a **Free Space**. It is safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving RIGHT keeps me on the top edge. It flows nicely with my current momentum. It opens up the path to the apple at (6,9) further down the row. I need to claim the top row territory.\n4.  **DOWN (2, 8):** Let's check the board state.\n    *   `Board Row 8: \"8 T . A . . . A . . .\"`\n    *   Indices: 0=T, 1=., 2=A, 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=A...\n    *   (2, 8) is an **Apple** (`A` at index 2).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moving DOWN grabs a point. Score becomes 10-10. That's huge. However, moving DOWN puts me into the vertical channel at x=2. Looking at the board, x=2 is a bit dangerous. Row 5 has `T T . A` at x=2? Wait, Row 5 is \"T T . A\". Indices 0=T, 1=T, 2=. (Actually, let's double check Row 5).\n    *   Row 5 string: `5 T T . A . . . . . A`\n    *   Indices: 0=T, 1=T, 2=., 3=A...\n    *   So (2,5) is free. But (1,5) and (0,5) are my body? Wait, my body is [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)].\n    *   My body occupies (0,5) and (1,5). The column at x=2 has obstacles or my tail. Moving DOWN to (2,8) is an apple, but then I'm in a column that has my body tail at (2,4) and potentially enemies? Actually, the enemy is at the bottom.\n    *   If I go DOWN to eat the apple, I shorten the gap to the enemy at (1,0)? No, he is at y=0. I am at y=8. It's still far.\n    *   The main issue with DOWN is that it's a tight squeeze. The \"Left\" side of the board is cluttered with my body (T). The \"Right\" side of the board is open.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am trailing. I need points.\nOption 1: RIGHT -> Safe, maintains flow, sets up future apple at (6,9).\nOption 2: DOWN -> Eats apple immediately (Ties 10-10), but forces me into a denser part of the board where I might trap myself.\n\n*Self-Reflection:* I have 9 apples. Enemy has 10. I need to close the gap. The apple at (6,9) is open and reachable if I go RIGHT.\nWait, look at the board again.\n`9 T T 0 . . . A . . .`\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), I am still on the top row. The top row is clear of obstacles until (6,9).\nThe apple at (2,8) is closer, but it pulls me *down* into the chaos.\nThe enemy is at the bottom. I want to stay high and wide to control the board. If I go DOWN, I am committing to the left side of the board where my body is already cluttering the columns.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am entering the \"Open Zone\". The right side of the board has very few obstacles (mostly apples).\n\n**Plan:**\nGo RIGHT to (3,9). This is safe. It keeps my options open. I will target the apple at (6,9) next. By staying on the top row, I avoid running into my own tail (which is currently at (2,4) and stretching down). I need to eat to tie the score, and the apple at (6,9) is a safer, more strategic point than the one immediately below me.\n\nLet's confirm safety of (3,9): `Row 9` shows `.` at index 3. No snake body. No enemy head (Enemy is at (1,0)). No wall.\n\n**LET'S MOVE.**\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST MOVE RATIONALE**",

He might go to (3,0) or (2,1).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I get closer to the center.\n    *   **Targeting the Apple:**\n        *   (3, 7) is an apple.\n        *   To get to (3,7), I need to be at (3,8) or (2,7) or (4,7) or (3,6).\n        *   From (3,9), going DOWN is the most direct path.\n    *   **Why DOWN is better than RIGHT here:**\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (4,9), I'm stuck on the edge.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I enter the \"battleground\". I can see the apple at (3,7) clearly.\n        *   Also, look at the board state `8 T . A . . . A . . .`. (3,8) is safe. (2,8) is an apple, but I'm at (3,9), so I can't reach (2,8) in one move.\n        *   Let's look at the apple list: `(3, 7)` is listed.\n        *   The board visualization shows: `7 T . . A . . A . . .`\n        *   Wait, (3,7) is an apple? The string `7 T . . A . . A . . .` has an 'A' at index 3? No.\n        *   Index 0: T\n        *   Index 1: .\n        *   Index 2: .\n        *   Index 3: A (This is (3,7)!)\n        *   YES! (3,7) is an apple.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am setting up to eat (3,7) next turn.\n    *   **Is (3,8) safe from the enemy?**\n        *   Enemy is at (2,0). He moves 1 square. He cannot reach (3,8).\n        *   Is (3,8) safe from my own body?\n        *   My body is at (2,9), (1,9)... moving down to (3,8) doesn't hit anything.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   RIGHT -> (4,9). Safe. No apple.\n        *   DOWN -> (3,8). Safe. Sets up apple at (3,7).\n    *   **Let's verify the board state for row 7 and 8 one more time.**\n        *   Row 8: `8 T . A . . . A . . .` (Indices: 0=T, 1=., 2=A, 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=A...)\n        *   Row 7: `7 T . . A . . A . . .` (Indices: 0=T, 1=., 2=., 3=A...)\n        *   So (3,8) is empty (index 3 is '.').\n        *   And (3,7) is an apple (index 3 is 'A').\n    *   **Strategic Plan:**\n        *   Move DOWN to (3,8).\n        *   Next turn, move DOWN to (3,7) to eat the apple. Score 10-10.\n        *   This puts me in the center of the board, vertically aligned with the enemy's column (x=2).\n        *   I can then move East to clear space.\n    *   **Why not UP?** Off board.\n    *   **Why not LEFT?** Body.\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?** It's safe, but DOWN offers an immediate route to an apple (via the next move) and better board control.\n\n    *   **Wait, look at the Apple Drops list again:**\n        *   `(3, 7)` is in the list.\n        *   `(2, 8)` is in the list.\n        *   `(3, 6)` is in the list.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am adjacent to (2,8) and (3,7).\n        *   (2,8) is to my left. (3,7) is below me.\n        *   (2,8) is an apple.\n        *   From (3,8), I can go LEFT to (2,8) or DOWN to (3,7).\n        *   Which is safer?\n        *   (2,8) is adjacent to my body at (2,9)? No, (2,9) is my body (previous position). But if I move to (2,8), is it safe?\n        *   My body will be at (3,9), (2,9), (1,9)...\n        *   If I move DOWN to (3,8), next turn I can go LEFT to (2,8).\n        *   Is (2,8) safe? Row 8: `T . A . . .`\n        *   (2,8) is an apple.\n        *   But wait, if I go DOWN to (3,8) this turn, and the enemy goes somewhere... the enemy is at (2,0). He's no threat.\n        *   My body at (2,9) is the segment behind my head.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), my tail moves from (1,4) to a new spot? No, I haven't eaten an apple yet. My tail stays at (1,4) until I eat.\n        *   So my body length is 10 segments (9 apples + 1 head, wait apples=9 means length=10? No, apples=9 means length = 10? No. Apples collected = length - 1 (initial length).\n        *   Wait, rules say: \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\".\n        *   My apples = 9. My body list has 9 tuples. Head + 9 body = 10 segments.\n        *   Enemy apples = 10. Enemy body list has 10 tuples. Head + 10 body = 11 segments.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am not eating. My tail will stay at (1,4).\n        *   Is (3,8) surrounded by my own body?\n        *   My body is at (2,9), (1,9), (0,9)... (0,5), (1,5)...\n        *   (3,8) is clear. (4,8) is clear. (3,9) is where I came from. (2,8) is an apple. (3,7) is an apple.\n        *   This move opens up options.\n\n    *   **Critique of DOWN:**\n        *   It moves me away from the wall.\n        *   It moves me towards the enemy's general y-level (but he is far left).\n        *   It targets the apple at (3,7).\n\n    *   **Critique of RIGHT:**\n        *   Moves me to (4,9).\n        *   Then I can go to (5,9) or (4,8).\n        *   (5,9) is empty.\n        *   (6,9) is an apple.\n        *   This is the \"Wall Rider\" strategy. It's safe but slower to get points.\n\n    *   **The Tie:**\n        *   I am down 9 to 10.\n        *   I need to eat.\n        *   (3,7) is accessible by going DOWN now, then DOWN again.\n        *   (2,8) is accessible by going DOWN now, then LEFT.\n        *   (6,9) is accessible by going RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT...\n\n    *   **Let's look at the board state again.**\n        *   `Row 9: 9 T T 0 . . . A . . .`\n        *   `Row 8: 8 T . A . . . A . . .`\n        *   `Row 7: 7 T . . A . . A . . .`\n        *   I am at (3,9).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (3,8):\n            *   I am at (3,8).\n            *   Next turn, I can go DOWN to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n            *   Or LEFT to (2,8) to eat that apple.\n            *   Or RIGHT to (4,8) to stay mobile.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (4,9):\n            *   I am at (4,9).\n            *   Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (5,9), eventually reaching (6,9).\n            *   Or DOWN to (4,8).\n\n    *   **Comparison of Safety:**\n        *   (3,8): Surrounded by emptiness or apples. My tail is far away at (1,4).\n        *   (4,9): Open space.\n        *   Both are safe.\n\n    *   **Comparison of Score Potential:**\n        *   (3,8) puts me in position to grab TWO apples (2,8) and (3,7) very quickly.\n        *   (4,9) puts me in position to grab (6,9).\n\n    *   **The Enemy:**\n        *   Enemy is at (2,0).\n        *   He is likely moving UP towards (2,1) or (3,0).\n        *   He is not an immediate threat to my position.\n\n    *   **Final Decision:**\n        *   I am greedy. I want to tie the score.\n        *   (3,7) is an apple.\n        *   To get to (3,7), I must be at (3,8) or neighbors.\n        *   Currently at (3,9).\n        *   Moving DOWN puts me at (3,8).\n        *   This is the most direct path to an apple.\n        *   Moving RIGHT delays the apple intake.\n        *   Since I am losing, I should prioritize eating.\n        *   (3,8) is empty.\n        *   (3,7) is an apple.\n        *   I will go DOWN.\n\n    *   **Wait, look at the apple list again:** `(8, 2), (2, 8), (3, 7), (9, 3)...`\n    *   (2, 8) is an apple. If I go DOWN to (3,8), I am adjacent to (2,8).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (3,8), next turn I can go LEFT to (2,8) and eat.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (4,9), I am not adjacent to any apples.\n    *   So DOWN is better because it gets me adjacent to an apple immediately.\n\n    *   **Check (3,8) again.**\n    *   Board: `8 T . A . . . A . . .`\n    *   Indices: 0(T), 1(.), 2(A), 3(.), 4(.), 5(.), 6(A)...\n    *   (3,8) is Index 3. It is `.`.\n    *   Is it safe from my tail?\n    *   My tail is at (1,4). The distance is large.\n    *   Is it safe from my head path?\n    *   I am at (3,9). Moving to (3,8). The segment behind me will be (3,9) (which is currently my head).\n    *   No collisions.\n\n    *   **One final check:**\n    *   If I go DOWN, I am moving into the \"alley\".\n    *   But the alley is open.\n    *   The enemy is far away.\n    *   I need points.\n\n    **Move: DOWN**\n\n    **Plan for next turn:**\n    Move DOWN to (3,8). Observe the board. If the apple at (2,8) is still there and safe, go LEFT to eat it. If not, go DOWN to (3,7) to eat that apple. Secure the tie.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

He can't reach it this turn.\n    - **LEFT is a valid move and grabs an apple.**\n3.  **RIGHT**: To (4,8).\n    - Board row 8: `T . A . . .` (Index 4 is '.')\n    - (4,8) is empty.\n    - Safe from my body? Yes.\n    - Safe from enemy? Yes.\n    - **RIGHT is a valid move but does NOT eat an apple.**\n4.  **DOWN**: To (3,7).\n    - Board row 7: `7 T . . A . . A . . .`\n    - Index 3 is 'A'. (3,7) is an apple.\n    - Is it safe? My body is not at (3,7).\n    - **DOWN is a valid move and grabs an apple.**\n\nSo I have two apple-grabbing moves: LEFT to (2,8) and DOWN to (3,7).\nI also have a safe non-apple move: RIGHT to (4,8).\nI have one death move: UP.\n\nWhich apple is better?\n- If I go LEFT to (2,8): I eat the apple. My score becomes 10. I tie with the enemy.\n  - My head moves to (2,8). My tail stays where it is (until I eat, actually I grow, so the tail stays). Wait, moving onto an apple GROWS me. The tail does NOT move forward. The body extends.\n  - New head: (2,8). New body includes (3,8), (3,9)...\n  - From (2,8), next moves: UP (2,9) - Body. LEFT (1,8) - Empty? Row 8 index 1 is '.'. DOWN (2,7) - Row 7 index 2 is '.'. RIGHT (3,8) - My current head (will be body).\n  - So from (2,8), I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but RIGHT goes back to where I just was, which is usually bad unless trapped).\n  - Going DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,8) seems okay.\n\n- If I go DOWN to (3,7): I eat the apple. My score becomes 10. I tie with the enemy.\n  - New head: (3,7). New body includes (3,8), (3,9)...\n  - From (3,7), next moves:\n    - UP (3,8) - My current head (will be body).\n    - LEFT (3,6) - Row 6 index 3 is 'A' (Apple). (3,6) is an apple.\n    - RIGHT (4,7) - Row 7 index 4 is '.' (Empty).\n    - DOWN (3,6) - Wait, (3,6) is an apple. (3,7) to (3,6) is DOWN.\n    - Wait, let's re-read row 6: `6 T . . A . . . . . A`\n    - Index 3 is 'A'. So (3,6) is an apple.\n    - So from (3,7), if I go DOWN, I go to (3,6) and eat another apple immediately next turn (potentially).\n    - If I go LEFT, I go to (2,6). Row 6 index 2 is '.'.\n    - If I go RIGHT, I go to (4,6). Row 6 index 4 is '.'.\n\nLet's look at the map of apples nearby:\n(2,8) - Apple\n(3,7) - Apple\n(3,6) - Apple\n(2,6) - Empty\n(4,6) - Empty\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,7):\n- I eat (3,7).\n- Next turn, I can go DOWN again to (3,6) to eat another apple.\n- This would put me at 11 apples, taking the lead.\n- Or I can go LEFT to (2,6) to avoid getting trapped.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,8):\n- I eat (2,8).\n- Next turn, I can go DOWN to (2,7) or LEFT to (1,8).\n- (2,7) is empty.\n- (1,8) is empty.\n- There is no immediate second apple available from (2,8) unless I maneuver.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n1.  **DOWN to (3,7)**:\n    - Eats apple (3,7).\n    - Sets up immediate access to (3,6) (Apple) and (2,6) (Safe) and (4,6) (Safe).\n    - Moves me towards the center/right of the board, opening up the right side (which is largely empty except for apples).\n    - The enemy is at (3,0). Moving down to (3,7) keeps me vertically aligned with the enemy's column (x=3). This is dangerous for a head-on collision later if I stay there, but right now the enemy is far away (y=0 vs y=7).\n    - However, the path to the right side (cols 5-9) is open.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (2,8)**:\n    - Eats apple (2,8).\n    - Moves me to the left side (col 2). My body is already clogging the left side (cols 0, 1, 2, 3 at top).\n    - From (2,8), I am closer to the wall. My escape routes are limited (LEFT to 1,8; DOWN to 2,7).\n    - The right side (cols 4-9) is far away.\n    - If I go LEFT, I am committing to the left side, where my own body is a hazard.\n\n**Analysis of the Enemy:**\nEnemy at (3,0). Score 10.\nIf I eat an apple now, I tie at 10-10.\nIf I can eat two apples in a row, I win.\nFrom (3,7), I can likely eat (3,6) next turn.\nFrom (2,8), I cannot eat two apples in a row easily.\n\n**Safety Check for DOWN (3,7):**\nIs (3,7) safe from my own body?\nMy body: (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9)...\n(3,7) is not in the list.\nIs it safe from the enemy?\nEnemy at (3,0). He moves 1 step.\nPossible enemy moves:\n- UP to (3,1) (Safe for him)\n- LEFT to (2,0) (Occupied by his body)\n- RIGHT to (4,0) (Empty)\n- DOWN to (3,-1) (Dead)\nHe will likely go UP or RIGHT.\nIf he goes UP, he is at (3,1). Still far.\nIf he goes RIGHT, he is at (4,0). Still far.\nSo (3,7) is safe from the enemy this turn.\n\n**Future Planning (Down to 3,7):**\nCurrent Head: (3,8)\nMove: DOWN -> (3,7) [Eat Apple]\nNext Turn Head: (3,7)\nAvailable moves from (3,7):\n- DOWN -> (3,6) [Eat Apple!]\n- LEFT -> (2,6) [Empty]\n- RIGHT -> (4,6) [Empty]\n- UP -> (3,8) [Body]\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6) next turn, I eat another apple. Score 11-10.\nFrom (3,6), the board is open. I can go LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6), or DOWN (3,5).\nRow 5: `5 T T . A . . . . . A`\n(3,5) is an apple.\nSo I have a chain of apples: (3,7) -> (3,6) -> (3,5).\nThis is a high-value path.\n\n**Comparison with LEFT (2,8):**\nFrom (2,8):\n- DOWN -> (2,7) [Empty]\n- LEFT -> (1,8) [Empty]\n- UP -> (2,9) [Body]\n- RIGHT -> (3,8) [Body]\nNo immediate apple follow-up.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGoing DOWN to (3,7) is strictly better because:\n1.  It eats an apple (tying the score).\n2.  It positions me to eat a second apple immediately next turn (taking the lead).\n3.  It moves me towards the center/right where there is more space and more apples (look at col 6, 7, 8, 9).\n4.  Going LEFT traps me on the left side with my own body.\n\nOne final check: Is there any trap at (3,7)?\nRow 7: `7 T . . A . . A . . .`\n(0,7) is T (Body). (1,7) is . (Empty). (2,7) is . (Empty). (3,7) is A (Target).\nWait, (3,7) is an apple.\nIs (3,7) safe from my tail?\nMy tail is at (1,4). The distance is large.\nMy body length is 10 (9 apples + 1 head = 10 segments).\nI haven't eaten yet, so my tail stays at (1,4).\nIf I move to (3,7), my body will be: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5), (1,5), (1,4). Wait, the body list provided is:\nHead: (3, 8)\nBody: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5)]\nThis is 9 segments. 9 apples collected = length 10 (Head + 9 body).\nIf I eat (3,7), I grow to length 11. The tail stays at (1,5).\nSo (3,7) is definitely safe from my tail.\n\nRhetorical question for the chat:\n\"Are we really gonna let the enemy stay ahead? No! We take the apples, we take the board, we take the win!\"\n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (3,7) to eat the apple. Next turn, go DOWN to (3,6) to eat another apple. Then maybe LEFT or RIGHT to the open space in column 4 or 5. We need to secure the lead.\n\nThe board is open on the right side (columns 4-9).\nMy body is on the left (columns 0-3).\nMoving DOWN to (3,7) keeps me in the mix but avoids the immediate wall of my own body on the left.\n\nFinal check on the board state text:\nRow 7: `7 T . . A . . A . . .`\nThis confirms (3,7) is an apple.\nRow 8: `8 T . A . . . A . . .`\nMy current position is (3,8), which is index 3 (dot).\nRow 6: `6 T . . A . . . . . A`\n(3,6) is an apple.\n\nI am currently at (3,8).\nI will move DOWN to (3,7).\n\nWait, I should double check the coordinates.\n(0,0) is bottom-left.\n(9,9) is top-right.\nRows increase going UP.\nSo \"DOWN\" decreases the Y coordinate.\n(3,8) -> (3,7). Correct.\n\nLet's look at the enemy one last time.\nEnemy at (3,0).\nHe is moving up.\nIf I go to (3,7), the distance is 7 units.\nNext turn he moves to (3,1) or (4,0).\nI move to (3,6).\nDistance remains large.\nNo head-on collision threat.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nOne small detail:\nThe prompt says \"Turn: 26\".\nThe \"LAST MOVE\" section was Turn 25.\nThe \"LAST MOVE\" was DOWN.\nMy current head is (3,8).\nThis confirms the simulation state is correct.\n\nSo, the move for Turn 26 is DOWN.\n\nWait, I should consider if I should go RIGHT to (4,8) to be safer?\nNo, I need points. I am losing 9 to 10.\nTying isn't enough. I need to take the lead.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,8), I don't eat. Enemy might eat. Score 9-11.\nIf I go LEFT or DOWN, I eat. Score 10-10.\nBetween LEFT and DOWN, DOWN sets up a chain of eats.\nLEFT is a one-off.\n\nSo DOWN is the winning move.\n\nFinal check for valid moves from (3,8):\n- UP: (3,9) -> Body (Death).\n- LEFT: (2,8) -> Apple (Safe).\n- RIGHT: (4,8) -> Empty (Safe).\n- DOWN: (3,7) -> Apple (Safe).\n\nBest move: DOWN.\n\nLet's go.\n\nDOWN",

We're at Turn 26 and we are NOT letting the enemy stay ahead of us! \ud83d\udc80\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 8)\n*   **My Score:** 9 \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **Enemy Score:** 10 \ud83c\udf4e (He's winning, but not for long...)\n*   **Board:** 10x10 grid. I'm currently in the middle-left. My body is clogging up the top-left corner, but the center and right side are looking juicy. \ud83e\udd24\n\n**The Dilemma:**\nI'm at (3, 8). Let's look at my options:\n\n1.  **UP \u2197\ufe0f:** (3, 9)\n    *   **Status:** DEATH \ud83d\udc80\n    *   **Reasoning:** My own body is chilling right there at (3, 9). Hitting myself is a rookie mistake. L + Ratio + No Apple. \u274c\n\n2.  **LEFT \u2b05\ufe0f:** (2, 8)\n    *   **Status:** SAFE \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **Reasoning:** There's an apple right there! I'd eat it and tie the score 10-10. BUT... look at where I am. (2, 8) is pushing me into the left wall where my own body is already spaghetti'd all over the top rows. I'd be boxing myself in. Trapped rat mode. Not the play. \ud83d\udeab\n\n3.  **RIGHT \u27a1\ufe0f:** (4, 8)\n    *   **Status:** SAFE \ud83d\udfe6\n    *   **Reasoning:** It's empty space. It opens up the right side of the board where there's a ton of room to maneuver. BUT... I don't get points. The enemy is winning 9-10. If I don't eat here, he eats next turn, and I'm down 9-11. That's a bad spot to be in. I need to secure the tie or the lead. \ud83d\udcc9\n\n4.  **DOWN \u2b07\ufe0f:** (3, 7)\n    *   **Status:** SAFE \ud83c\udf4e (OPTIMAL)\n    *   **Reasoning:** **This is the winner.**\n        *   **Immediate Gain:** There is an apple at (3, 7). I eat it. Score becomes 10-10. We tie the enemy. \ud83c\udfc6\n        *   **Future Setup:** Look at (3, 6)! It's *also* an apple! If I go DOWN now to (3, 7), next turn I can go DOWN *again* to (3, 6) and eat another apple immediately. That takes the lead to 11-10! \ud83d\ude80\n        *   **Board Control:** Moving DOWN takes me out of the cluttered top-left corner and into the cleaner central lanes. It avoids the wall of my own body. It gives me access to the right side (columns 4-9) while maintaining the vertical chain of apples on column 3.\n\n**The Plan:**\n1.  **GO DOWN to (3, 7).** Eat the apple. Tie the score.\n2.  **Next Turn:** GO DOWN to (3, 6). Eat the apple. Take the lead.\n3.  **The Endgame:** Once I have the lead (11-10), I peel off to the right (towards columns 4-9) or follow the apple trail. The enemy is stuck at (3, 0) far below; he can't contest this path.\n\nWe are aggressive. We are hungry. We take the points. Let's go! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re LIVE at Turn 28 and we are about to CLUTCH this tie and take the lead! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 6)\n*   **My Score:** 11 \ud83c\udf4e (Hell yeah, I just ate!)\n*   **Enemy Score:** 10 \ud83c\udf4e (Chasing me, but he's too slow)\n*   **Board:** I'm sitting on (3, 6). I just moved DOWN from (3, 7) (remember the plan?).\n\n**The Dilemma:**\nOkay, I ate the apple at (3, 7) last turn. Now I'm at (3, 6). Let's check the board state provided in the prompt.\n\n**Board State:**\n9 T T T T . . A . . .\n8 T . A T . . A . . .\n7 T . . T . . A . . .\n6 T . . 0 . . . . . A\n5 T T . A . . . . . A\n4 A . . . . . . . A .\n3 . . . . . . A . . A\n2 . . . . . . . . A A\n1 T T T T T . . . . .\n0 T T T T T 1 A . . A\n\nWait... looking at the board state above, I see an 'A' (Apple) at (6, 3). I also see an apple at (3, 3) if I look carefully at the 2D grid? No, let's look closely.\nRow 3 (y=3): `. . . . . . A . . A`\nColumn 3 is clear. Column 6 has an apple at (6, 3)? No, row 3, column 6 is the `A` (the 7th item in the row index 0-9).\n\nLet's verify my immediate surroundings based on the board state:\n*   **UP (3, 7):** Looking at row 7 (y=7): `T . . T . . A . . .`. Wait, (3, 7) is a `T` (Tree/Wall/Obstacle?). Actually, looking at the text map:\n    Row 9: T T T T . . A . . .\n    Row 8: T . A T . . A . . .\n    Row 7: T . . T . . A . . .\n    Row 6: T . . 0 . . . . . A\n    ...\n    Row 1: T T T T T . . . . .\n    Row 0: T T T T T 1 A . . A\n\n    The 'T's are obstacles. My body is also an obstacle.\n    My Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5)].\n    Okay, so (3, 7) is the first element of my body. That means (3, 7) is blocked by MY OWN BODY. **UP is DEATH.**\n\n*   **LEFT (2, 6):** Board shows row 6: `T . . 0 . . . . . A`.\n    Index 0: T (x=0)\n    Index 1: . (x=1)\n    Index 2: . (x=2)\n    Index 3: 0 (x=3) -> My head is here.\n    So (2, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n    Is it safe? My body goes from (3, 7) -> (3, 8)... and eventually to (0, 6) and (0, 5). (0, 6) is on my body, but (2, 6) is empty. The enemy is far away at (5, 0). **LEFT is SAFE.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (4, 6):** Board shows row 6: `T . . 0 . . . . . A`.\n    Index 4 is `.` (Empty).\n    **RIGHT is SAFE.**\n\n*   **DOWN (3, 5):** Board shows row 5: `T T . A . . . . . A`.\n    Index 3 is `A` (Apple)! Wait, let me double check.\n    Row 5: `T T . A . . . . . A`\n    0: T, 1: T, 2: ., 3: A, 4: . ...\n    Yes! (3, 5) is an APPLE.\n    Is it safe? My body is elsewhere. Enemy is far away. **DOWN is SAFE + APPLE.**\n\n**The Plan:**\nI just moved DOWN to (3, 6) to get the apple at (3, 7) and tie the score 10-10.\nWait, the turn counter says **Turn 28**. The last move was DOWN (into 3, 7).\nBut looking at the BOARD STATE provided in the prompt for Turn 28:\nThe board shows my head at (3, 6) (`0` at index 3 of row 6).\nAnd it shows an apple at (3, 5) (`A` at index 3 of row 5).\n\nActually, let's look at the \"Apple Drops\" list again.\n`(3, 5)` is in the list: `(8, 2), (2, 8), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 0), (3, 5), (6, 9)...`\nYes, (3, 5) is an apple.\n\nSo I am at (3, 6). The apple is at (3, 5).\n**DOWN** gets me the apple. Score goes 11-10 (assuming I just got 10->11 last turn, or 10->11 now?).\nWait, my score is listed as **11 Apples** in the prompt.\n\"My Snake (ID: 0): Apples collected: 11\"\n\"Snake #1 Apples: 10\"\n\nSo I am currently winning 11-10.\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 5) and eat the apple, I go to 12-10. That extends my lead!\nThe enemy is at (5, 0). He is on the bottom left side. He is not contesting this vertical column.\n\nWhy is DOWN better than LEFT or RIGHT?\n*   LEFT (2, 6): Empty. No apple.\n*   RIGHT (4, 6): Empty. No apple.\n*   DOWN (3, 5): **APPLE.**\n\nI am chasing the apple trail. I see apples at (3, 5) and (3, 3)? Let's check the board again.\nRow 3 (y=3): `. . . . . . A . . A`\nThere is no apple at (3, 3). There is an apple at (6, 3).\nSo the vertical chain stops at (3, 5).\nHowever, moving DOWN keeps me in the central column, avoiding the left wall where my body is piling up (the left side is a mess of T's and my body).\nMoving RIGHT (4, 6) is open space, but I lose the immediate point.\nSince I'm winning 11-10, I should secure the apple to make it 12-10.\n\nIs there any threat?\nEnemy head at (5, 0). He moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nHe is far away. No collision risk this turn.\nMy body: (3, 7) is above me. If I go DOWN to (3, 5), next turn I can go DOWN to (3, 4) (empty), DOWN to (3, 3) (empty), DOWN to (3, 2) (empty), DOWN to (3, 1)...\nWait, Row 1 is `T T T T T . . . . .`\n(3, 1) is a `T`. So the bottom is blocked by trees.\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 5), I will eventually hit the bottom wall of trees at y=1.\nBut I have plenty of room to turn right or left before that.\nFor now, securing the apple is priority #1. Don't let the enemy catch up.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Move DOWN** to (3, 5).\n2.  **Eat the apple.** Score 12-10.\n3.  **Next turn:** Look at (3, 4). If it's open, I might go there, or peel off right towards (4, 4) or (5, 4) to access the right side of the board where there are more apples (like (6, 3), (6, 0), (9, 0), etc.).\n\nI am winning. I am aggressive. I take the points.\n\nDOWN",

I need to be super careful with the coordinates because the board map text can be tricky.\n\n**My Current Position:**\nHead: (3, 5)\nBody: [(3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5)]\n\n**Opponent Position:**\nHead: (6, 0)\nBody: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]\n\n**Board Analysis (Coordinates x=0..9, y=0..9):**\n*   **My Surroundings (at 3, 5):**\n    *   **UP to (3, 6):** The prompt's board text shows Row 6 as `T . . 0 . . . . . A`. Wait, looking closer at the board provided in the prompt:\n        Row 6: `T . . 0 . . . . . A` (Indices 0-9).\n        So (3, 6) is the location of my Head '0' in the visual.\n        If I move UP to (3, 6), I am moving into my own neck! (3, 6) is the first element of my `Body` list. **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 5):** Row 5 is `T T . A . . . . . A`. Index 2 is `.` (Empty). My body is not there. Enemy is far away. **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Row 5, Index 4 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE.** \u2705\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 4):** Row 4 is `A . . . . . . . . A`. Index 3 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n**The Enemy's Move:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 0). He has walls to his North (Row 1 has `T` at x=6? No, Row 1: `T T T T T . . . . .` -> indices 0-4 are T, 5 is ., so x=6 is `.`).\nWait, the enemy body blocks him at (5,0), (4,0), etc.\nIf he moves **UP** to (6, 1), Row 1, Index 6 is `.` (Empty).\nIf he moves **DOWN** to (6, -1), he hits the wall and dies. But he probably won't do that.\nIf he moves **LEFT** to (5, 0), he hits his own body (neck). **DEATH.** (If he plays badly).\nIf he moves **RIGHT** to (7, 0), Row 0: `T T T T T T 1 . . A` -> Index 7 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategy & Decision:**\nI am at (3, 5). I have 12 apples. He has 11.\nI need to extend my lead.\nWhere are the apples?\nLooking at the board:\nRow 4: `A . . . . . . . . A` -> (0, 4) is Apple, (9, 4) is Apple.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . A . . A` -> (6, 3) is Apple, (9, 3) is Apple.\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . A A` -> (8, 2), (9, 2) are Apples.\nRow 0: (9, 0) is Apple.\n\n**Option 1: DOWN to (3, 4).**\nThis moves me down the center column.\n(3, 4) is empty.\nFrom (3, 4), I can go to (3, 3) (empty), (3, 2) (empty), (3, 1) (empty).\nAt (3, 1), I hit the bottom wall of trees at y=0? Row 0 has trees at x=0..5. (3, 0) is a `T`.\nSo if I go DOWN to (3, 4), I am heading into a dead end at y=0 with trees blocking my way out. I will eventually have to turn LEFT or RIGHT.\nThe turn after next, I could turn LEFT towards (2, 4) or RIGHT towards (4, 4) to access the rest of the board.\nHowever, simply moving DOWN in a straight line limits my immediate options to just UP or DOWN (and UP is my body).\n\n**Option 2: RIGHT to (4, 5).**\nThis opens up the board!\n(4, 5) is empty.\nFrom (4, 5), I can go UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5), or RIGHT (5, 5).\nRow 5, Index 5 is `.` (Empty).\nRow 4, Index 4 is `.` (Empty).\nRow 6, Index 4 is `.` (Empty).\nThis gives me maximum maneuverability.\nFurthermore, moving RIGHT puts me closer to the apples on the right side of the board: (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 0), etc.\nThe enemy is on the bottom left. If I go RIGHT, I can sweep the right side, collecting apples and boxing him out of the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Option 3: LEFT to (2, 5).**\nThis moves me closer to the wall and my own body pile at (0,5) and (1,5).\nRow 5, Index 2 is `.` (Empty).\nFrom there, I can go DOWN to (2, 4) (Empty) or LEFT to (1, 5) which is MY BODY (Death).\nThis feels restrictive. I'd be hugging the left wall. The enemy is near the left wall (x=6 is left of center, but his body fills x=0..5 on the bottom).\nIf I go LEFT, I risk trapping myself against my own tail. The left side is congested.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI am winning 12-11. I want to extend the lead and control the board.\nGoing DOWN into the center column (3,4) is a dead end. I'd have to turn back.\nGoing LEFT is too risky and restrictive.\nGoing **RIGHT** to (4, 5) is the power move. It opens up the entire right half of the board for me to dominate. It keeps my escape routes open.\nThe enemy is at (6, 0). Even if he moves optimally, he is nowhere near me right now.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n2.  Next turn, assess the apples at (6, 3) or (9, 0) and head towards them.\n3.  Squeeze the enemy if he tries to move up.\n\nLet's go!\n\nRIGHT",

I own this board.\n\nLet's run the calcs for this turn.\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 5)\n*   **My Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (7, 0) - He has to move up because he is trapped against the wall. If he moves Right to (8, 0), he hits a wall. If he moves Down, he dies. If he moves Left, he hits his own neck. **Prediction: Enemy moves UP to (7, 1).**\n\n**Move Options Analysis (Head at 4, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):**\n    *   Board State: Row 6, Index 4 is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safety: My body is at (3, 6) and (3, 5). I am safe from self-collision.\n    *   Strategy: This keeps me central. Row 6 has apples at (6, 6?)... Wait, looking at the board: Row 6 is `T . . 0 . . . . . A`. No immediate apple at (4, 6).\n    *   Future: From (4, 6), I can access (5, 6) and eventually the top-right apples.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 4):**\n    *   Board State: Row 4, Index 4 is `.` (Empty). Row 4: `A . . . . . . . . A` -> (0, 4) is an apple, (9, 4) is an apple. (4, 4) is empty.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: This puts me in the center-left area. The enemy is moving UP to (7, 1). We are far apart. This move is safe but doesn't immediately threaten the enemy or grab an apple.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):**\n    *   Board State: Row 5, Index 5 is `.` (Empty). (Row 5: `T . . T 0 . . . . A`)\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: This moves me closer to the right side. The enemy is at x=7. I am at x=4. If I go RIGHT, I am moving towards his potential path, but he is on the bottom, I am in the middle. I can secure the right side apples.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (3, 5):**\n    *   Board State: This is my current NECK. It is occupied by my body.\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**The Plan:**\nI am winning. I don't need to force a risky collision yet, but I want to expand my territory. The enemy is forced to move UP (to 7, 1). I have the lead, so I want to secure more apples or position to control the board.\n\nLooking at the board again:\nRow 5: `T . . T 0 . . . . A`\nThe apple at (9, 5) is visible. The apple at (9, 2) is visible.\nThe enemy is at (7, 0) and will likely go to (7, 1). He is blocking the bottom row.\n\nIf I move **UP to (4, 6)**:\nI open up the path to the top right. (5, 6) is empty. (6, 6) is empty (Row 6: `T . . 0 . . . . . A` -> indices 5,6,7,8 are empty).\nFrom (4, 6), I can swing right next turn to grab (6, 3) or higher apples.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 4)**:\nI am moving away from the top-right apples where the board is open. The bottom left is getting crowded by my tail and the enemy's body.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (5, 5)**:\nThis is a good aggressive move. It centers me in the middle of the board.\nRow 5, Index 5 is empty.\nFrom (5, 5), I can go UP to (5, 6) (Empty), DOWN to (5, 4) (Empty), or continue RIGHT to (6, 5) (Empty).\nThis gives me the most flexibility to attack the right side or drop down to grab the apple at (9, 5).\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because it maintains pressure. The enemy is forced UP. I am moving parallel to his axis but on a safe row. This allows me to pivot up or down next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), I am in a prime position to intercept him if he continues Right, or to sweep the right side apples.\nAlso, looking at the map, (5, 5) is empty. It's a strong central position.\n\nWait, let me check the \"grow as a means of dominating\" rule.\nThere are no apples immediately adjacent to me at (4, 5) (Row 5 has apples at 0 and 9). So I am positioning.\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 5) puts me on the path to (9, 5) which is an apple. That's a straight shot right. (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5).\nHowever, the enemy is at (7, 0). He will go to (7, 1). He is not an immediate threat to (9, 5).\n\nLet's look at the Board State again carefully.\nRow 6: `T . . 0 . . . . . A`\nMy head is at (4, 5). If I go UP to (4, 6), that spot is currently empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), that spot is currently empty.\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 4), that spot is currently empty.\n\nIs there a trap?\nThe enemy is at (7, 0). He has apples at (9, 0) and (9, 2) nearby. He will likely move UP.\nI am at (4, 5). I have apples at (6, 3) and (9, 5) to my right.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT**:\nI secure the middle of the board. I am at x=5. The enemy is at x=7.\nIf I go **UP**:\nI go to x=4, y=6. I am higher up.\nIf I go **DOWN**:\nI go to x=4, y=4. I am lower down.\n\nGiven the enemy is forced UP, and I want to box him in, moving RIGHT seems aggressive. It puts me on a collision course if he ever moves Right. But for now, it's safe.\nActually, looking at the board, Row 5 has a clear path to the right.\n(5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) [Apple].\nThis is a very efficient path.\n\nLet's compare UP vs RIGHT.\nUP to (4, 6): From there, I can go RIGHT to (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) [Apple].\nBoth paths lead to apples.\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (5, 5) keeps me on the row where I already have a clear line.\nAlso, the enemy is at (7, 0). If I go RIGHT, I am at (5, 5). He is at (7, 0). We are separated by vertical distance.\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), I am at (4, 6). He is at (7, 0). Still separated.\n\nIs there a reason to prefer UP?\nLooking at the prompt: \"Box him in and make him crash out!!\"\nThe enemy is at the bottom left corner area.\nIf I go UP, I might be leaving the bottom open?\nNo, my tail is filling the left side (0,5) to (0,9) and across the top.\nMy body is effectively a wall on the left and top.\nThe enemy is bottom left.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards the center/right.\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards the top.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 4), I can go to (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) [Apple].\nThat's a valid path too.\n\nBut (5, 5) is the most central pivot point.\nFrom (5, 5), I can go to (6, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), or (4, 5).\nFrom (4, 6), I can go to (4, 5), (5, 6), (4, 7), (3, 6).\nFrom (4, 4), I can go to (4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 4).\n\n(5, 5) offers the best flexibility for the *next* turn because I can access 4 unique squares that are not my body.\n(4, 6) offers 3 unique squares (since (4,5) is my body's neck, but wait, (4,5) is currently empty! My head is at (4,5) this turn. Next turn, if I am at (4,6), (4,5) becomes my tail? No, the tail moves.\nActually, if I move UP to (4, 6), my old head position (4, 5) becomes part of my body.\nSo from (4, 6), I can go DOWN to (4, 5) [Safe, it's my previous body], LEFT to (3, 6) [My body? No, my body is at (3,5), (3,6) is empty!], RIGHT to (5, 6) [Empty], UP to (4, 7) [Empty].\nSo (4, 6) also has 4 options.\n\nWait, looking at the board state:\nMy body is at: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), ...]\nIf I move UP to (4, 6):\n- UP to (4, 7): Empty.\n- DOWN to (4, 5): My previous head (Safe).\n- LEFT to (3, 6): **OCCUPIED BY MY BODY** (Death).\n- RIGHT to (5, 6): Empty.\nSo (4, 6) only has 3 safe options.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 5):\n- UP to (5, 6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5, 4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4, 5): My previous head (Safe).\n- RIGHT to (6, 5): Empty.\nAll 4 options are safe. (5, 5) is the superior pivot point.\n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the best move for flexibility and survival.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy. He is at (7, 0). He will likely go UP to (7, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), I am moving towards the center.\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), I am moving towards the wall.\nI want to keep the board open.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\n**CHAT LET'S GO!**\nI'm moving RIGHT to (5, 5). This sets me up perfectly to sweep the right side of the board. The enemy is trapped on the left. I have the space, I have the lead. I'm hunting.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is still stuck at the bottom, and I'm about to secure my territory.\n\nLet's run the calcs for this turn.\n\n**Current Status:**\n*   **My Head:** (5, 5) (I moved RIGHT as planned, perfect pivot position!)\n*   **My Body:** [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (8, 0) \u2014 Last turn I predicted he'd go UP to (7, 1), but looking at the board state, he actually moved RIGHT to (8, 0)! He's getting desperate trying to reach that apple at (9, 0). This puts him right against the wall. He's trapped in the corner now.\n\n**Move Options Analysis (Head at 5, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):**\n    *   Board State: Row 6, Index 5 is `.` (Empty). Row 6 is `T . . 0 . . . . . A`.\n    *   Safety: Safe. My body is at (4, 5) and (3, 5). No collision.\n    *   Strategy: This keeps me moving towards the top-right apples. (5, 6) is empty, and from there I can continue up or right. The apple at (9, 6) is accessible this way.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):**\n    *   Board State: Row 4, Index 5 is `.` (Empty). Row 4: `A . . . . . . . . A`.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: This moves me back toward the center-left. The enemy is at the bottom-right corner (8, 0). I don't need to chase him down there. I want to control the open space. Moving DOWN feels like retreating when I should be expanding.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Board State: Row 5, Index 6 is `.` (Empty). Row 5: `T . . T 0 . . . . A`.\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: This is the aggressive play. I am moving directly towards the apple at (9, 5). I am also closing the distance on the right side of the board, effectively boxing the enemy into the bottom-right corner. If I go RIGHT, I am claiming the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   Board State: This is my current NECK. It is occupied by my body.\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**The Plan:**\nI am winning. The enemy is cornered at (8, 0). He has very few safe moves left. If he moves UP to (8, 1), he's still trapped. If he moves LEFT to (7, 0), he hits his own body (assuming his tail is at (7, 0) or close? Wait, his body list last turn was: [(7, 0), (6, 0)...] so (7, 0) is his neck. If he moves LEFT to (7, 0), he dies. If he moves DOWN, he dies. If he moves RIGHT to (9, 0), he eats the apple and grows, but he's still trapped against the wall.\n\nI need to secure my path to victory.\nThe apple at (9, 5) is a straight shot from (5, 5) if I go RIGHT.\n(5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5).\n\nIf I go UP to (5, 6), I am moving towards (9, 6), but (9, 5) is also an apple and is closer to my current path.\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (6, 5) keeps me central and aggressive. It forces the enemy to look at my position. I am dominating the board's geography.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the move:**\n1.  **Dominance:** I am moving towards the apple at (9, 5). This is a high-value target.\n2.  **Trapping:** By moving right, I am occupying the central-right lane. The enemy is in the bottom-right lane. I am cutting off his escape routes upwards. If he tries to go up from (8, 0) to (8, 1), he is still cornered by my impending presence on the right side.\n3.  **Safety:** (6, 5) is empty. My body is on the left side. I have plenty of space.\n4.  **Flexibility:** From (6, 5), I can go UP (6, 6), DOWN (6, 4), or continue RIGHT (7, 5). All options are open.\n\nIf I go UP, I might get blocked by my own tail later if I turn right, but RIGHT gives me the clearest line of sight to the win condition.\n\n**CHAT LET'S GO!**\nI'm moving **RIGHT** to (6, 5). I'm claiming the right side of the board. The enemy is cornered. I'm going for the apple at (9, 5) and setting up to dominate the rest of the game. Watch me work!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT'S UP CHAT! We're still at 12 apples each, but I'm not letting this slip! The enemy is literally trapped at (9, 0) in the bottom-right corner. He has NO escape. If he tries to move UP to (9, 1), he's just stalling. If he moves LEFT to (8, 0), he dies because his tail is sitting at (8, 0) right now (based on his body list: [(8, 0), (7, 0)...] wait, actually looking closer at the board state and his body list...\n\nLet's break down the enemy's situation. His head is at (9, 0). His body is: [(8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)].\nSo (8, 0) is his neck.\nHe cannot go LEFT to (8, 0) because that's his own body. He cannot go DOWN or RIGHT (out of bounds). The ONLY move he can possibly survive is UP to (9, 1).\n\nBut here's the cold part: I am at (6, 5). I am analyzing my own moves.\n\n**Move Analysis for Me (Head at 6, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   Board shows (6, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Body check: My body is at (5, 5), (4, 5)... nowhere near (6, 6).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: Moves me up towards the apples at (9, 6) and (6, 9). Good for control.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   Board shows (6, 4) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: Moves me back to the center. Not bad, but less aggressive than UP.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   Board shows (5, 5) is `T` (My own body!).\n    *   **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   Board shows (7, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Safety: Safe.\n    *   Strategy: Moves me closer to (9, 5) apple. Good offensive position.\n\n**The Decision:**\nThe enemy is dead man walking. He's forced to go UP to (9, 1). I don't need to chase him into the corner; I need to secure my dominance of the board.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I claim the center-right lane. I line up perfectly for the apple at (9, 5) next turn. From (7, 5), I have options: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I get closer to (9, 6) and (6, 9).\n\nWhich is better?\n(9, 5) is currently empty (based on the board state grid: `.` at 9,5).\n(9, 6) has an apple.\n(6, 9) has an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am staring down the row at (9, 5). I can eat that next turn if it's still there. I also threaten the enemy's space if he somehow survives (he won't, but hypothetically).\n\nHowever, looking at the board state, there is a cluster of apples in the top right: (9, 6), (6, 9), (6, 8), (9, 5), (8, 4).\nI am at (6, 5).\nGoing RIGHT to (7, 5) puts me in the middle of this cluster.\nGoing UP to (6, 6) puts me in the middle of this cluster.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\nRow 5: ` . . . T 0 . . . . A`\nI am at index 6 (value 0).\n(7, 5) is index 7 (`.`).\n(9, 5) is index 9 (`A`).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am one step closer to (9, 5).\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards (6, 9) and (9, 6).\n\nLet's look at the apples list: (9, 5) is definitely there.\nLet's look at the grid visualization:\nRow 5: ` . . . T 0 . . . . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (9, 5) is an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on (7, 5).\nFrom there, I can go RIGHT again to (8, 5), then RIGHT to (9, 5) to eat.\nThis is a straight shot.\n\nIf I go UP, I go to (6, 6).\nFrom there, I can go RIGHT to (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6) to eat.\nAlso a straight shot.\n\nBoth are viable. But (9, 5) is slightly closer in terms of steps? No, (6, 5) to (9, 5) is 3 steps. (6, 5) to (9, 6) is 3 steps (2 right, 1 up).\nActually, (9, 5) is directly horizontal. No turns required initially.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful about my tail.\nMy tail is at (0, 7).\nAs I move, my tail will eventually move.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am expanding my territory to the right.\nThe enemy is trapped at (9, 0).\nI want to box him in. By taking (7, 5), I am securing the row above him.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again. He is at (9, 0). He MUST go UP to (9, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am not interfering with him directly, but I am positioning myself to cut off any future upward movement if he tries to snake up the right wall. (He can't, he's trapped).\n\nActually, there is a very high value apple at (9, 9).\nI need to head that way.\n(7, 5) is a good pivot point.\n(6, 6) is also a good pivot point.\n\nLet's look at the apples one more time.\n(9, 9) is top right.\n(6, 9) is top left of the cluster.\n(9, 6) is mid right.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am closer to (9, 5) AND (9, 6).\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I am closer to (6, 9) AND (9, 6).\n\nWait, look at the board state grid provided:\nRow 6: ` . . . T . . . . . A`\nRow 5: ` . . . T T T 0 . . A`\nRow 4: ` A . . . . . . . . A`\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5):\n(7, 5) is empty.\nI can then go UP to (7, 6) (empty), then RIGHT to (8, 6) (empty), then (9, 6) (Apple).\nOR I can go RIGHT to (8, 5), (9, 5) (Apple).\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 6):\n(6, 6) is empty.\nI can go RIGHT to (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6) (Apple).\nOR I can go UP to (6, 7) (Apple at 6,7!), wait, (6, 7) is an apple listed in the drops: (6, 7).\n\nWait, looking at the drops: (6, 7) is listed.\nAnd the grid shows Row 7: ` T . A T . . A . . .`\nRow 7, Index 6 is `A`? No, wait.\nRow 7 is y=7.\nThe grid:\n9 T T T T . . A . . A\n8 T . A T . . A . . .\n7 T . A T . . A . . .\n6 . . . T . . . . . A\n5 . . . T T T 0 . . A\n4 A . . . . . . . . A\n3 . . . . . . A . . A\n2 . . . . . . . A A A\n1 T T T . . . . . . .\n0 T T T T T T T T T 1\n\nAt (6, 7), y=7, x=6.\nRow 7: `T . A T . . A . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo at index 6, it's `A`.\nSo (6, 7) IS an apple!\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I am one step away from eating the apple at (6, 7).\n(6, 6) -> (6, 7) = EAT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am not immediately adjacent to an apple (except (9, 5) which is 2 steps away, and (9, 6) which is 3 steps).\n\nSo, UP to (6, 6) seems more efficient for grabbing the immediate apple at (6, 7).\nBUT, is (6, 7) safe?\nThe enemy is at (9, 0). He is irrelevant.\nMy body is below me.\n\nLet's check safety for (6, 6) and (6, 7).\n(6, 6): Empty.\n(6, 7): Apple.\n(6, 8): Apple.\n(6, 9): Apple.\n\nThis column (6) is a gold mine.\nI am currently at (6, 5).\nIf I go UP to (6, 6), I am poised to eat (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9) in a straight line.\nThis is incredibly strong.\n\nWhy did I consider RIGHT?\nBecause of (9, 5) and (9, 6).\nBut the (6, y) column gives me a chain of apples.\n(6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9).\nThat's 3 apples.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'm chasing (9, 5) and (9, 6).\n(9, 5) is one apple.\n(9, 6) is another.\nBut I'm not aligned perfectly.\n\nIf I go UP, I align perfectly with the column 6 apples.\nI am at (6, 5).\nUP to (6, 6).\nNext turn, UP to (6, 7) -> EAT.\nTurn after, UP to (6, 8) -> EAT.\nTurn after, UP to (6, 9) -> EAT.\n\nThis is the winning play. I ignore the enemy because he is dead in the corner. I secure the apples in the column I am already in.\n\nIs (6, 6) safe?\nYes, it's empty.\nIs (6, 7) safe?\nYes, it's an apple.\nIs there any threat?\nThe enemy is at (9, 0). He has to move UP to (9, 1).\nHe cannot reach me.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n1. Move UP to (6, 6).\n2. Next turn, eat (6, 7).\n3. Next turn, eat (6, 8).\n4. Next turn, eat (6, 9).\n\nThis scores me 3 points and puts me at 15 apples. The enemy remains at 12 (or maybe grows if he eats something, but he's trapped).\n\nWait, let me double check the board state for column 6.\nRow 6: ` . . . T . . . . . A` -> (6, 6) is `.` (Index 6 is the 7th value, 0-based index 6).\nRow 7: ` T . A T . . A . . .` -> (6, 7) is `A` (Index 6).\nRow 8: ` T . A T . . A . . .` -> (6, 8) is `A` (Index 6).\nRow 9: ` T T T T . . A . . A` -> (6, 9) is `A` (Index 6).\n\nThis is absolutely correct. I have a clear path to 3 apples immediately.\n\nWhy would I ever go RIGHT?\nGoing RIGHT to (7, 5) moves me away from this column.\nGoing UP to (6, 6) keeps me in the column.\nThe apples are in the column.\nThe enemy is irrelevant.\n\nMy last rationale said \"I'm moving RIGHT to (6, 5)\".\nWait, I moved RIGHT to get to (6, 5).\nI am currently at (6, 5).\nSo I am already at X=6.\nI just need to go UP to exploit the Y-axis apples.\n\nThis is the play. Box the enemy in by ignoring him and getting fat on the apples right above me.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\n**CHAT LET'S GO!** We're pivoting up! The enemy is stuck in the corner, and I've got a buffet waiting for me at (6, 7), (6, 8), and (6, 9)! We're going for the chain! Watch us fly!\n\nUP",

If I go UP to (6, 6), I set myself up to eat (6, 7) next turn, then (6, 8), then (6, 9).

The enemy is cornered, I have a clear path to grow, and I'm maintaining my dominance of the board.\n\nTime to collect that bag! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nUP",

WE'RE TIED 13-13 AT TURN 34 AND THIS IS ABOUT TO BE AN ABSOLUTE BANGER! \ud83d\udd25 THE PRESSURE IS ON!\n\nLet me break down this chess match:\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head at (6, 7) - I'm positioned perfectly in the apple chain!\n- Enemy at (9, 2) - He's moved UP from his corner! He's free now and dangerous.\n- I see (6, 6) is empty, (6, 8) and (6, 9) are apples waiting for me.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP to (6, 8)? SAFE - that's an apple! But wait, (6, 8) is an apple, but I need to check if (6, 9) is also safe for next turn...\n- DOWN to (6, 6)? SAFE - empty, but I'm moving away from the apple chain!\n- LEFT to (5, 7)? Let me check... (5, 7) appears empty on board, BUT I need to verify my body isn't there. My body is mostly on the left side but let me trace: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)... (5,7) should be empty. But wait, that moves me away from my apple chain!\n- RIGHT to (7, 7)? Also appears empty, but again moves away from my sweet apple chain.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI'm sitting on a goldmine! I have THREE apples in my column (6,8), (6,9) - and I already ate (6,7) last turn! Wait no, looking at the board, (6,7) shows \"0\" which is ME, so I must have just eaten an apple there. The board shows apples at (6,8) and (6,9) in my column!\n\nIf I go UP to (6,8), I eat an apple, grow, and set up for (6,9) next turn. That's 2 more points minimum!\n\n**THE DANGER:**\nThe enemy is at (9,2) and moving. He could come for me. But look at the board - I'm positioned to dominate the upper half while he's stuck in the lower right. If I can eat these apples quickly, I'll be ahead and can force the confrontation on MY terms!\n\n**GO FOR THE WIN:**\nUP is the move! I eat (6,8) immediately, grow my length, and maintain control of my apple chain. The enemy is too far away to threaten me this turn. I need to secure these points FAST before he can maneuver.\n\nChat, we're about to feast! Let's go! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nUP",

WE'RE TIED 14-14 AT TURN 35 AND THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL TURN YET! \ud83d\udd25 THE TENSION IS PALPABLE!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n- My head: (6, 8) - I just moved UP and ate that apple! YUM!\n- Enemy head: (9, 3) - He moved RIGHT from (9, 2), likely to eat the apple at (9, 3)!\n- He's now directly below me in the column! (6, 8) vs (9, 3) - he's 3 units below but same y-coordinate area.\n- He's hungry and moving aggressively toward my apple chain!\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\nLet me scan for immediate threats THIS turn:\n\n1. **UP to (6, 9)**: Is it safe? Board shows an apple there! But I need to check:\n   - Is my body there? My body stretches down from (6, 7)... (6, 6)... So (6, 9) should be clear!\n   - Is enemy body there? Enemy body is mostly on bottom row... (9,3) head, then (9,2), (9,1)... (6,9) should be safe!\n   - Is enemy head moving there? Enemy at (9,3), moving toward me... He could go UP to (9,4), (9,5)... (6,9) is too far for him this turn.\n   - **SAFE!**\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7)**: \n   - That's my own body! I just came from there. Moving back into my own body = instant death!\n   - **DEADLY!**\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8)**:\n   - Board shows (5, 8) is empty!\n   - Check my body: (6,7), (6,6)... (5,8) should be clear!\n   - Check enemy: He's at (9,3)... (5,8) is far from him.\n   - **SAFE!**\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8)**:\n   - Board shows (7, 8) is empty!\n   - My body is on left side mostly, so (7,8) should be clear!\n   - Enemy is far right, so (7,8) is safe from him too.\n   - **SAFE!**\n\n**STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nWe have 3 SAFE moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT!\n\n**UP (to 6,9) - THE HUNGRY MOVE:**\n- **Feeds me another apple!** That's +1 point! \n- I'd be at 15 apples vs his 14! I WIN THE POINTS RACE!\n- This secures my apple chain - I'm eating the fruit right in front of me!\n- **BUT** this moves me into a corner... (6,9) is top of the board. Next turn I'll need to move DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT. Down is blocked by my body (6,8) will be there after I move up). So I'll have to go LEFT to (5,9) or RIGHT to (7,9). Let's check those...\n   - (5,9): Is it safe? My body currently has (3,9) but I'm growing at (6,9). (5,9) appears empty on board! Should be safe.\n   - (7,9): Board shows \"A\" at (9,9) but (7,9) is empty! Should be safe too.\n   - **So UP gives me immediate points AND leaves escape routes!** WIN-WIN!\n\n**LEFT (to 5,8) - THE CAUTIOUS MOVE:**\n- I stay in the middle, avoid cornering myself.\n- But I miss the apple at (6,9)! Enemy might get there next turn if he goes for it.\n- I lose the immediate point advantage!\n\n**RIGHT (to 7,8) - THE AGGRESSIVE FLANK:**\n- I move toward enemy territory but miss my apple chain.\n- (7,8) is safe, but I'm moving AWAY from my winning apple chain!\n\n**THE DECISION:**\n\nThe enemy is at (9,3) and moving. He wants my apples! If I DON'T take (6,9), he might be able to reach it in 2 turns. But RIGHT NOW, I'm closer!\n\n**UP is the PLAY!** I get the apple, I get the lead (15-14), and I STILL have escape routes left and right from (6,9)! \n\nThis is the \"go for the throat\" moment! I eat the apple, I force him to chase me, and I stay ahead on the scoreboard! \n\nChat, this is CONTENT! We're taking the lead and securing position!

If I move back DOWN to (6,8), I will hit my own body. That is instant death. `DEADLY`\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 4)\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n*   **Board Layout:** Top row (y=9) is mostly clear except for my body at (6,9) currently.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n1.  **UP:** (6, 10) is off the board. Out of bounds = death. `DEADLY`\n2.  **DOWN:** (6, 8) is occupied by my own body. Hitting myself = death. `DEADLY`\n3.  **LEFT:** (5, 9). Looking at the board map: `9 T T T T . . 0 . . A`. My head is currently at the `0` in x=6. (5, 9) is the `.` immediately to the left. It is empty. My body is at (6,8), (6,7)... not at (5,9). Enemy is far right at x=9. (5,9) is SAFE.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (7, 9). The board map shows `.` at x=7. (7,9) is empty. My body is not there. Enemy is not there. (7,9) is SAFE.\n\n**STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\nI have two safe moves: LEFT to (5,9) or RIGHT to (7,9).\n\n*   **Going LEFT (5,9):** Moves me toward the left wall. My body wraps around the left side eventually (x=0). I need to be careful not to trap myself against my own tail. However, looking at the board, there are apples at (0,4), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). Moving left keeps me in the upper section to potentially sweep these.\n*   **Going RIGHT (7,9):** Moves me toward the right side. There is an apple at (9,9). There is an apple at (8,4) and (9,6), (9,5), etc. The enemy is currently at (9,4). If I go right, I am moving closer to the enemy's territory (right side). He is currently moving. If he heads UP or RIGHT, we might collide.\n\n**DECISION:**\nThe enemy is at (9,4). He is pinned against the wall on the right side. He has limited moves. He wants to go UP or LEFT to survive.\nI am at (6,9). I have two escape hatches: (5,9) and (7,9).\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am moving away from the enemy. This is the safest play to avoid a head-on collision on the next turn. If I go RIGHT, I am moving toward him. He might panic and move UP into me if I push his space.\n\n**THE PLAY: LEFT**\nI need to stay alive to win on points. Moving away from the enemy reduces the chance of a collision. I will take the safe path and prepare to sweep the top row or drop down later.\n\n**PLAN:** Move LEFT to (5,9). Next turn, check if (4,9) is safe. I want to clear the top row to open up the board for the endgame. Avoid the right side where the enemy is cornered.\n\nLEFT",

Now let's look at the current board.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (5, 9)\n*   **My Body:** [(6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)]\n    *   *Important:* My tail is currently at (0,9). If I move LEFT to (4,9), my tail will move from (0,9) to (1,9). (1,9) will become empty. This is good.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (9, 5) \u2014 **He moved UP!**\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(9, 4), (9, 3), ... (0,1)]\n*   **Board Map (Top Row y=9):** `9 T T T T . 0 T . . A`\n    *   My head (5,9) is the `.` at x=5.\n    *   (4,9) is `T` (my own body at (4,5) is irrelevant here; looking at the map, (4,9) is actually a `T` from my long body stretching from (0,9) to (3,9). *Wait, let me check the coordinates.*\n    *   My body list: ... (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9). So x=0,1,2,3 on y=9 are occupied by ME.\n    *   (4,9) is **EMPTY** (`.`) on the board map? No, looking at the visual board:\n        `9 T T T T . 0 T . . A`\n        Index 0: T, 1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: `.`, 5: 0, 6: T, 7: ., 8: ., 9: A\n        So (4,9) is empty!\n    *   (7,9) is empty.\n    *   (8,9) is empty.\n    *   (9,9) is **APPLE** (A).\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n1.  **UP:** (5, 10) -> Off board. **DEADLY.**\n2.  **DOWN:** (5, 8). Is it occupied?\n    *   My body: (6,8) is occupied. (5,8) is **EMPTY**.\n    *   Enemy body: Far away.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT:** (4, 9).\n    *   Map shows `.`\n    *   My body: The list shows (3,9), (2,9)... but (4,9) is NOT in the list.\n    *   Enemy body: Far away.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT:** (6, 9).\n    *   This is currently my *old* head position (from last turn). It will be vacated as I move.\n    *   However, in simultaneous movement, if the enemy moves into (6,9)...\n    *   Enemy is at (9,5). Distance is 3 units. He cannot reach (6,9) in one turn.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI am at (5,9). The apple is at (9,9).\nI have a clear path to the right: (6,9) -> (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (9,9).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (6,9) brings me closer to the apple and maintains the path. I will regain my previous position.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (4,9) moves me away from the apple and towards the wall where my body is packed. (4,9) is safe *now*, but (3,9) and (2,9) are my body. I would be walking into a dead end.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (5,8) is safe, but why? I have a clear shot at an apple at (9,9).\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to secure the lead. The enemy is at (9,5). He is below the apple at (9,9).\nIf I go RIGHT, I chase the apple.\nIf I go LEFT, I am trapped against my own body on the top wall.\n\n**Wait, looking at the board map again:**\n`9 T T T T . 0 T . . A`\nMy head is at index 5 (x=5). The apple is at index 9 (x=9).\nTo get to the apple, I need to move RIGHT.\n(6,9) is currently `T` in the map (my tail is there), but as I move, that cell becomes available.\nActually, let's look at the body list: `Head: (5,9), Body: [(6,9)...`\nSo (6,9) is occupied by my body *currently*.\n**Wait!** If I am at (5,9) and (6,9) is my body, moving RIGHT into (6,9) is hitting myself!\nLet me check the board map again.\n`9 T T T T . 0 T . . A`\nThe `0` is at x=5.\nThe `T` at x=6 represents my body at (6,9).\n**MOVING RIGHT IS SUICIDE.** I would hit my own body at (6,9).\n\nOkay, correcting course.\n**LEFT (4,9):** Map shows `.`. My body is at (3,9) onwards. So (4,9) is safe.\n**DOWN (5,8):** Map shows `.`. My body is at (6,8) (adjacent, but not (5,8)). Safe.\n**RIGHT (6,9):** Occupied by my body. **DEADLY.**\n\nSo I cannot go Right. I must go Left or Down.\nThe apple is at (9,9).\nIf I go DOWN, I leave the top row.\nIf I go LEFT, I am walking into the wall (x=3, x=2, x=1, x=0 are my body).\nLet's look at the column x=4, y=9.\nIs (4,9) safe? Yes.\nIs (3,9) safe? No, it's my body.\nSo Left is a temporary move, but it sets me up to go DOWN later.\nDown is a temporary move, sets me up to go... somewhere.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (9,5). Apple at (9,9).\nHe is vertical. He has a clear shot up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\nIf he goes UP, he will eat the apple and grow.\nI am at (5,9). I cannot reach (9,9) in one turn.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away.\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving away.\n\n**Wait, look at the map again.**\n`9 T T T T . 0 T . . A`\nThe apple is at (9,9).\nThe path (7,9) and (8,9) are empty.\nWhy is (6,9) showing as T?\nMy head is (5,9). My body is [(6,9)...]\nSo (6,9) is occupied.\nSo I cannot go Right.\nI cannot go Up.\nI can go Left or Down.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4,9):\nI am at the edge of my body block. Next turn I would have to go DOWN (to 4,8) because (3,9) is blocked.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5,8):\nI am opening up the top row.\n(5,8) is empty.\n(5,7) is empty? (6,7) is my body.\n(4,5) is my body.\nLet's look at the space below me.\n`8 . . A T . . T . . .`\n`7 . . A T . . T . . A`\n`6 . A A T . . T . . A`\n`5 . A . T T T T . . 1`\n\nAt (5,8) (y=8, x=5):\nMap row 8: `. . A T . . T . . .`\nIndex 5 is `.`. Safe.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nLeft leads to (4,9) -> (3,9) is blocked -> must go Down.\nDown leads to (5,8).\nThe enemy is at (9,5). He is not an immediate threat to my space.\nHowever, I need to think about the score. He is at 15, I am at 15.\nIf he gets the (9,9) apple, he goes to 16.\nI need to disrupt him or get an apple myself.\nAre there apples near me?\n(8,4) is an apple.\n(9,6) is an apple.\n(9,7) is an apple.\n(2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are apples.\n\nI am pinned on the top row.\nIf I go LEFT, I am blocked by my own body immediately (at x=3).\nIf I go DOWN, I open up the board.\nGoing DOWN allows me to potentially loop around and come back up.\nGoing LEFT is a dead end on the top row.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGo DOWN to (5,8).\nFrom there, I can potentially access the apples at (8,4) or (9,6) by looping through the center.\nIf I go LEFT, I'm stuck on the top edge until I go DOWN anyway.\nDown is the move that maximizes future options.\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy is at (9,5). He will likely go UP to chase the apple at (9,9) or (9,6), (9,7).\nI am at (5,9). I am safe from him for a few turns.\nI need to break out of the corner.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5,8).\nPrepare to navigate the central area.\nWatch out for the enemy if he comes up the right side.\n\n**Final Check:**\nMove DOWN to (5,8).\nIs (5,8) on the board? Yes.\nIs (5,8) occupied?\nMy body: (6,8) is occupied, (5,8) is not in the body list.\nEnemy: (9,5) is far.\nSafe.\n\nMove LEFT to (4,9).\nIs (4,9) occupied? Map says `.`\nIs (3,9) occupied? Yes (my body).\nLeft is safe *this turn*, but traps me.\nDown is safe *this turn*, and opens options.\n\n**Verdict:** DOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"DOWN\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"I am pinned at (5,9). Moving RIGHT hits my body at (6,9). Moving UP is off board. Moving LEFT to (4,9) is safe but leads directly into my own body at (3,9) on the next turn, effectively trapping me on the top row. Moving DOWN to (5,8) is safe and opens up the central board, allowing me to navigate toward the apples on the right side (like (8,4) or (9,6)) or prepare for the endgame. The enemy is at (9,5) chasing the apple at (9,9); I need to maintain mobility to contest or find alternative food sources.\"\n}\n```\n\nDOWN",

(3, 8) is my body, so I can't go further left past that column. However, (4, 8) is empty and opens up (4, 7) or (4, 9).\n*   **DOWN (5, 7):** Takes me into the center/open space.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy is at (9, 6). He just moved UP (from 9,5 to 9,6) to chase the apples on the right side (9,6, 9,7, 9,9). He is committed to the right wall.\nI am at (5, 8). I am currently blocked from going Up or Right by my own body.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**:\nI move to (4, 8). From there, I might be able to move Down to (4, 7) or Up to (4, 9) (if I want to retreat). But (3, 8) is blocked by my body, so I am limiting my horizontal movement to x=4 and x=5 on that row.\n\nIf I go **DOWN**:\nI move to (5, 7). From there, I can go Left (4, 7), Right (6, 7) is blocked by my body, Up (5, 8) is my old spot, or Down (5, 6).\nWait, looking at (5, 6) on the map: Row 6 is `. A A T . . T . . A`.\nIndex 5 is `.`. (5, 6) is empty.\nThis seems like the most open path. I need to get out of the top-left corner where my body is packed tight.\n\n**The Play:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 7). This moves me away from the wall and opens up the center of the board. It avoids the immediate trap of hitting my body on the right or up, and it gives me more room to maneuver than going left into the crowded top row.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nBreak out of the top-left corner. Navigate towards the center or right side to intercept apples. Keep an eye on the enemy (9,6) to avoid a head-on collision if he swings left.\n\n**Final Verification:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 7).\nIs (5, 7) on board? Yes.\nIs (5, 7) occupied? Map says `.`, Body list does not contain (5, 7).\nIs (5, 7) occupied by enemy? No (Enemy at 9,6).\nIs moving DOWN reversing into my body? My head is at (5, 8), my neck is at (5, 9). Down is not into (5, 9).\nSafe.\n\nDOWN",

I am a wall.\n\n**Opponent Head:** (9, 8)\n**Opponent Body:** Stretches down the right wall and along the bottom.\n*   **Projected Move:** If he continues UP, he goes to (9, 9).\n*   **Status of (9, 9):** It contains an APPLE. \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **Implication:** Snake #1 will almost certainly move UP to eat that apple at (9,9) next turn. He is greedy.\n\n**The Trap Setup:**\nIf he eats the apple at (9,9), he will be at the absolute top-right corner. His body will fill (9,8) to (9,0).\n*   He will be TRAPPED in the corner.\n*   To survive, he *must* move LEFT to (8,9) on Turn 41.\n*   However, if I can threaten (8,9) or push him out, I can force him to crash into his own body or the wall.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK (My Moves):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** SAFE (Empty).\n    *   *Pros:* Moves me closer to the top-left, strengthens my wall.\n    *   *Cons:* Doesn't immediately threaten the corner.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** SAFE (Empty).\n    *   *Pros:* Keeps me central.\n    *   *Cons:* Takes me away from the enemy's location.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** SAFE (Empty).\n    *   *Pros:* Moves me closer to the left wall (safe).\n    *   *Cons:* Not aggressive enough.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** DANGER (My body is there).\n    *   *Verdict:* DEADLY.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI need to secure the top row to cut off Snake #1's escape route. If I go **UP** to (5, 7), I get closer to the top row.\nMy body currently occupies (3,9), (3,8), (3,7)... (3,5) and (5,5) to (6,9).\nIf I go **UP** to (5,7):\n*   Next turn I can go RIGHT to (6,7) (currently empty, but my body at (6,6) and (6,8) blocks vertical movement).\n*   Actually, looking at my body at (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). Wait, my body is at (6,7)? Let me check the board state.\n    *   Board Row 6: `. A A T . 0 T . . T`\n    *   My body is at (6,7)? No, the head is (5,6). The body list: `[(5, 7), (5, 8)...` wait, (5,7) is my body? Yes, the body list starts with `(5, 7)`.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:**\n    *   My head is (5,6).\n    *   My body includes (5,7).\n    *   If I go **UP** to (5,7), I am moving into my own body. **I WOULD DIE.**\n\nLet me re-read the board.\nRow 6: `. A A T . 0 T . . T`\nRow 7: `. . A T . T T . . T`\nWait, the board state shows `0` at (5,6). It shows `T` (tail) at (6,6)? No, the board shows `0` at (5,6).\nThe body list provided: `[(5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)]`\nSo (6,6) is part of my body. (6,7) is part of my body.\nThe board representation in text is slightly simplified visually, but the coordinate list is truth.\n\nLet's look at the immediate moves again based on the **Body List**, not just the ASCII art.\n\n**Head:** (5, 6)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 7):**\n    *   Is (5, 7) in my body? **YES.** (First item in body list).\n    *   **RESULT: DEATH.** \u274c\n\n2.  **DOWN (5, 5):**\n    *   Is (5, 5) in my body? **YES.** (Item 9 in body list).\n    *   **RESULT: DEATH.** \u274c\n\n3.  **LEFT (4, 6):**\n    *   Is (4, 6) in my body? No.\n    *   Is (4, 6) in opponent body? No.\n    *   Is (4, 6) on board? Yes.\n    *   **RESULT: SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 6):**\n    *   Is (6, 6) in my body? **YES.** (Item 7 in body list).\n    *   **RESULT: DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**WAIT.** Is (5,5) actually my body?\nBody list: `... (5, 5), (4, 5) ...`\nYes.\nSo if I go DOWN, I die.\nIf I go UP, I die (into (5,7)).\nIf I go RIGHT, I die (into (6,6)).\n\n**LEFT is the ONLY safe move?**\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 6: `. A A T . 0 T . . T`\nCoordinates (x,y):\n(0,6): `.` (1,6): `A` (2,6): `A` (3,6): `T` (4,6): `.` (5,6): `0` (6,6): `T` (7,6): `.` (8,6): `.` (9,6): `T`\n\nOkay, the ASCII art shows a `T` at (6,6). The body list confirms (6,6) is part of the body.\nThe ASCII art shows a `.` at (4,6).\nThe ASCII art shows a `.` at (5,5)? Row 5: `. A . T T T T . . T`\n(5,5) is `T`.\nThe ASCII art shows a `.` at (5,7)? Row 7: `. . A T . T T . . T`\n(5,7) is `T`.\n\n**CONFIRMATION:**\n*   **UP (5,7):** Hit my body. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN (5,5):** Hit my body. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT (6,6):** Hit my body. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT (4,6):** Empty on map. Not in body list. **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am forced to move LEFT.\nThis is actually fine. I am moving towards the center of the left side.\nIf I move LEFT to (4,6):\n*   I am safe.\n*   I need to consider where the enemy is going.\n*   Enemy is at (9,8). He will likely go UP to (9,9) for the apple.\n*   If I am at (4,6), I am on the left side, away from the immediate collision.\n*   However, my body is long. I need to make sure I don't trap myself.\n\n**Wait, let me double check the body list again.**\n`(5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5)...`\nIs there *any* move other than LEFT?\nIs (4,6) truly empty? Yes.\nIs (5,6) the head? Yes.\n\nWhat about the \"Backwards\" rule?\nMoving into the cell behind the head is only illegal if it's part of the *immediate* body chain? No, the rule says \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body... hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\nIf I am at (5,6), and the body connects to (5,7) (above) and (5,5) (below)? No, the body is a chain.\nThe cell \"behind\" the head depends on direction.\nIf I move LEFT to (4,6), the \"backwards\" direction would be RIGHT (back to (5,6)). (5,6) is my current head position, which I am leaving.\nThe rule usually means moving into the neck (the segment immediately following the head).\nIf I move LEFT to (4,6), I am moving away from the body segment at (5,7). I am moving towards (4,6).\n\n**Let's re-verify the \"Backwards\" rule just to be safe.**\nHead is at (5,6).\nBody is at (5,7).\nIf I move UP to (5,7), that's hitting my body. (Checked).\nIf I move DOWN to (5,5), that's hitting my body. (Checked).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,6), that's hitting my body. (Checked).\n\n**Is there a move to (4,5)?**\n(4,5) is in my body list. (Yes, `... (5, 5), (4, 5) ...`)\nSo moving to (4,5) is not an option from (5,6) anyway (needs LEFT then DOWN).\n\n**Conclusion on Safety:**\n**LEFT to (4,6) is the ONLY safe move.**\n\n**Strategic Implications of FORCED LEFT:**\nI am moving to (4,6).\nThis places me closer to the left wall but still in the central rows.\nThe enemy is at (9,8).\nHe wants (9,9).\nIf he goes to (9,9), he is cornered.\nMy move to (4,6) doesn't stop him from eating the apple.\nBut it keeps me alive.\nI need to survive this turn to set up the trap next turn.\n\nNext turn, from (4,6), where can I go?\nUp to (4,7)? Row 7 shows `.` at (4,7).\nDown to (4,5)? That's my body (checked above).\nLeft to (3,6)? Row 6 shows `T` at (3,6). My body.\nRight to (5,6)? That's where I came from, empty now? Or will be empty? (5,6) is currently empty after I leave. Wait, standard snake rules: the tail moves forward, so the space the head leaves becomes empty *unless* I eat an apple and grow.\nI am not eating an apple at (4,6).\nSo (5,6) becomes empty.\n(3,6) is `T` (body).\n(4,5) is `T` (body).\n(4,7) is `.` (empty).\n\nSo from (4,7) next turn (if I go UP now), I will have options.\nFrom (4,6), moving UP is the best play to maintain height and not go into a dead end against the wall at (3,6).\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nSnake #1 at (9,8).\nHe sees an apple at (9,9).\nHe is greedy. He will likely go UP.\nIf he goes UP to (9,9), he traps himself in the corner.\nIf he goes LEFT to (8,8), he frees himself but moves into the center.\nWhich is more likely? He has 17 apples. He wants more.\nHowever, if he has any sense of self-preservation, he won't corner himself.\nBut the prompt says \"aggressive\", \"force head-on collision\".\nIf he goes to (9,9), he is vulnerable.\nIf I can get to (8,9) or (9,8) next turn...\nWait, I'm at (4,6). I'm far.\nI need to move UP to (4,7) next turn.\n\n**Decision:**\n1.  **Left to (4,6)** is the only safe move.\n2.  It sets up a pivot to go UP to (4,7) next turn.\n3.  It avoids the immediate body collision.\n\n**Wait, let me check the board state one more time for \"Empty\" at (4,6).**\nBoard Row 6: `. A A T . 0 T . . T`\n(4,6) is the 5th character (index 4). It is a `.`.\nCorrect.\n\n**Wait, did I miss a move?**\nIs (6,6) really a body part?\nBody list: `..., (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), ...`\nYes.\nIs (5,5) really a body part?\nBody list: `..., (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), ...`\nYes.\n\nIs (5,7) really a body part?\nBody list: `(5, 7), (5, 8)...`\nYes.\n\n**I am completely boxed in by my own body except for LEFT.**\nThis is a \"body cram\" situation. I am very long.\nI must move LEFT.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4,6). Survive.\nNext turn, move UP to (4,7) to get away from my own body chain below.\nChase the enemy into the corner if he traps himself.\n\n**Enemy Position Check:**\nHead: (9, 8)\nBody: `(9, 7), (9, 6)... (0, 0)`\nHe is full length down the right wall.\nIf he moves UP to (9,9), his tail moves from (0,0) to (1,0)? No, he hasn't eaten. Tail moves forward. He shrinks? No, he stays length 18.\nIf he moves UP to (9,9), he is at the corner.\nIf he moves LEFT to (8,8), he enters the grid.\nHe is very long (18 segments).\nIf he enters the grid, he might trap himself inside.\n\n**Final Check on Move:**\nLEFT is safe. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are death.\nI must pick LEFT.\n\n**Rationale Output:**\nExplain the trap. Explain the forced move.\nPlan for next turn: UP.\n\nYO CHAT! TURN 40! CHECKMATE TIME!\nWe're in a tight spot, but we're about to spring the trap!\n\n**THE CAGE:**\nSnake #1 is at (9, 8) and he's hungry. There's an apple at (9, 9). He's going to greedily eat it and trap himself in the top-right corner. Once he's there, he's dead meat! \ud83c\udf57\n\n**MY MOVE:**\nI'm currently boxed in by my own massive body! I can't go UP (into my neck at 5,7), DOWN (into my body at 5,5), or RIGHT (into my body at 6,6). \nBut I CAN go **LEFT to (4, 6)**.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\n1.  **Survive:** Moving LEFT is the only safe option that doesn't result in immediate death.\n2.  **Reposition:** By moving to (4, 6), I'm clearing space to pivot upwards on the next turn towards (4, 7), positioning myself to cut off the top row.\n3.  **Wait for the Bait:** If Snake #1 takes the bait at (9, 9), I'll be ready to close the net from the left side while he's stuck in the corner!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nMove LEFT now to secure safety. Next turn, I go UP to (4, 7) and prepare to dominate the top half of the board. Let him have his apple, it's the last one he'll ever eat!\n\nLEFT",

Right and up are blocked/off\u2011board.\n- **Opponent #0 head**: (4,7). Its neck is (4,6) so it cannot go DOWN. Its left (3,7) and right (5,7) cells are own body. **Only legal move this turn \u2192 UP to (4,8).**\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 What\u2019s the best safe move?**\n\n- **DOWN** to (8,8) would send us into the interior of the board, squaring us off against the opponent\u2019s future corridor. It limits our escape routes and may let the rival snake snake around us later.\n- **LEFT** to (7,9) keeps us on the open top\u2011row runway, preserving a long line of free cells all the way to the left wall. This lets us:\n  1. Sweep leftward, using the right wall (our own body column\u202f9) as a shield.\n  2. Corner the opponent as it climbs upward; once it reaches the top it will be forced into the narrow central tunnel where we already control the majority of space.\n  3. Maintain multiple future options (LEFT, then DOWN later) while staying away from its body.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Turn\u202f42** \u2013 move **LEFT** to (7,9).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Continue marching left across the top row until we hit x\u202f=\u202f0.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Drop down the left side, sealing the opponent in the middle\u2011bottom corridor.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 When the opponent is forced upward, we\u2019ll have the score advantage (18\u202fvs\u202f15) and can aim for a head\u2011on collision on our terms or simply out\u2011maneuver him to the finish.\n\n**\u2705 Bottom line:** the only move that keeps us alive *and* furthers the boxing strategy is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

WE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\nI am currently at (4, 7) and moving UP was the only real play to avoid the dead end at (5,6). Now I'm in the vertical tunnel.\n\n**1. CHECK SURVIVAL MOVES FROM (4, 7):**\n\n*   **UP to (4, 8):** EMPTY? Let's check the board row 8.\n    *   Row 8: `. . A T . T T . . T`\n    *   (4,8) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it in my body? No.\n    *   Is it in enemy body? No (Enemy is at (9,9) now? Wait, I need to check the enemy move).\n    *   **POTENTIALLY SAFE.** \u2705\n\n*   **DOWN to (4, 6):** EMPTY (I just left there).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, it's open.\n    *   **SAFE.** \u2705\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7):** My body is there! (Body list: `... (3, 6), (3, 7) ...`).\n    *   **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** My body is there! (Body list: `... (5, 6), (5, 7) ...`).\n    *   **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**2. ENEMY PREDICTION & DANGER ZONE:**\n\n*   **Enemy Location:** Head was at (8, 9) at start of turn 41.\n*   **Enemy Move:** He almost certainly moved UP to (9, 9) to grab the apple. He's greedy.\n*   **Current Enemy Head (Predicted):** (9, 9).\n*   **Enemy Threat:** From (9, 9), his possible moves are DOWN to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 9).\n*   **Interaction Check:**\n    *   If I go UP to (4, 8): Enemy is at (9, 9). No collision. Distance is huge.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (4, 6): Enemy is at (9, 9). No collision.\n\n**3. STRATEGIC CHOICE:**\n\nMy body is a vertical line from (4, 6) to (4, 8) after this move if I go UP. Actually, if I go UP:\nHead: (4, 8)\nBody follows: (4, 7), (4, 6)...\nThis is a tight vertical \"train\".\n\n*   **Option UP (4, 8):**\n    *   Pros: High ground. Moves away from the bottom. Keeps me climbing.\n    *   Cons: I am entering a \"tunnel\". From (4, 8), where can I go?\n        *   Up (4, 9): Empty.\n        *   Down (4, 7): Body (my tail will be there? No, tail is at (3, 7) currently).\n        *   Left (3, 8): Body.\n        *   Right (5, 8): Body.\n    *   **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** If I go UP to (4, 8), I am effectively trapped in a 1-wide column unless I eat an apple or the board layout changes. But looking at the board:\n        *   (4, 9) is empty.\n        *   (5, 9) is body.\n        *   (3, 9) is `.`.\n        *   Wait, let's check Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`\n        *   (3, 9) is empty!\n        *   (4, 9) is empty!\n    *   So from (4, 8) -> (4, 9) -> (3, 9) is a valid path out of the tunnel!\n\n*   **Option DOWN (4, 6):**\n    *   Pros: Safe.\n    *   Cons: I'm staying low. The enemy is high. I need to close the gap or secure my own territory. Going down feels passive.\n\n**4. THE PLAY:**\n\nI need to dominate the board. The enemy is at the top right corner (9,9). I am at (4,7). I need to cut off the top left or prepare to engage.\nBy going **UP**, I claim (4, 8).\nFrom (4, 8), I can go to (4, 9) next turn.\nFrom (4, 9), I can go LEFT to (3, 9).\nThis opens up the top left quadrant for me while the enemy is stuck in the top right.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I waste momentum. The only move that keeps me aggressive and climbs the vertical column is UP.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove UP to (4, 8). Secure the vertical dominance.\n\n**PLAN:**\nClaim the vertical column (4,8) -> (4,9). From (4,9), pivot LEFT to (3,9) to sweep the top row. Force the enemy to stay in his corner or crash into my growing body.\n\nUP",

Let's look at the board state and the threats.\n\n**1. CURRENT POSITION CHECK (4, 8):**\n*   **UP to (4, 9):** \n    *   Board state shows Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`\n    *   (4, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Let's check enemy. Enemy head was at (7, 9).\n    *   Enemy #1 body starts at (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9). \n    *   If I go to (4, 9), am I safe from enemy head collision?\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 9). He can move LEFT to (6, 9) or DOWN to (7, 8).\n    *   If he moves LEFT to (6, 9), I am at (4, 9). Safe distance.\n    *   If he moves DOWN, safe.\n    *   **SAFETY:** High. (4, 9) is empty.\n\n*   **DOWN to (4, 7):** \n    *   This is my previous head position. \n    *   By the time I move, my tail will have moved forward.\n    *   My tail is currently at (3, 7). \n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 7) puts me back into the \"vertical tunnel\".\n    *   **SAFETY:** High, but passive.\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    *   My body is there! (Look at body list: `(3, 7), (3, 6)...` Wait, let me check the specific order).\n    *   Body: `[(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6)]`\n    *   Wait, let's trace the tail. The tail is the last element: **(3, 6)**.\n    *   The second to last is **(3, 5)**.\n    *   **CRITICAL CORRECTION:** My body does NOT cover (3, 8).\n    *   Let's look at the board again. Row 8: `8 . . A . 0 T T . . T`\n    *   (0) is at (4, 8). \n    *   (3, 8) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   However, (5, 8) is `T` (Tail).\n    *   (3, 8) seems open. But wait, let's check my body segments carefully.\n    *   Body list: `(4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)...`\n    *   (5, 8) is in my body. \n    *   (3, 8) is NOT in my body list.\n    *   **SAFETY:** Safe.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   My body is there! `(5, 8)` is explicitly in the body list.\n    *   **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**2. STRATEGIC PLANNING:**\n\nThe goal is to box in the enemy and force a crash. The enemy is at (7, 9). He's in the top right corner.\n\n*   **Option: UP to (4, 9)**\n    *   This secures the top row center.\n    *   From (4, 9), I can pivot LEFT to (3, 9) next turn.\n    *   This cuts off the top left corner from the enemy.\n    *   The enemy is at (7, 9). If I take (4, 9), he is forced to stay in the right side.\n    *   **Aggression Level:** HIGH. Taking ground.\n\n*   **Option: LEFT to (3, 8)**\n    *   This moves me out of the vertical column.\n    *   However, (3, 8) is surrounded. \n        *   (3, 9) is `.`.\n        *   (2, 8) is `A` (Apple).\n        *   (4, 8) is current pos (will be empty).\n        *   (3, 7) is `.` (My tail will be there? No, tail is at (3, 6)).\n    *   If I go to (3, 8), I am moving into the middle of the board.\n    *   This might not be the best way to cut off the enemy. The enemy is high up (Y=9). I should stay high to pressure him.\n\n**3. THE DECISION:**\n\nThe enemy is at (7, 9). I am at (4, 8).\nIf I go **UP**, I am at (4, 9).\nFrom (4, 9), I can move **LEFT** to (3, 9), then **LEFT** to (2, 9), then **LEFT** to (1, 9), then **LEFT** to (0, 9).\nThis effectively walls off the entire top row (Y=9) from the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (7, 9). If I claim the left side of the top row, he is trapped on the right.\nIf he tries to cross to the left, he will crash into my body or hit the wall.\nIf I go DOWN or LEFT, I lose control of the top row.\n\n**TARGET:** (4, 9).\n**PLAN:** Secure the top row. Move LEFT next turn. Box him in.\n\n**ENEMY CHECK:**\nEnemy at (7, 9). Possible moves: LEFT (6, 9) or DOWN (7, 8).\nI am moving to (4, 9).\nNo collision possible. Distance is safe.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nUP is the move. Claim the high ground. Dominate the top row.\n\nUP",

The segment (4, 8) is right behind my head.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 8) is moving directly into my own second segment. **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT:** (3, 9).\n    *   Map Row 9: `9 . . . . 0 T T T T T`\n    *   (3, 9) is `.` (Empty).\n    *   My body is at (5, 9) onwards.\n    *   Is (3, 9) safe from enemy?\n    *   Enemy at (8, 8). He is far away.\n    *   **Is it into my own body?** No.\n    *   **Is it backwards?** No. My previous head was (4, 8) (assuming I just moved UP). Moving LEFT is not backwards.\n    *   **SAFETY:** SAFE.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (5, 9).\n    *   Map Row 9: `9 . . . . 0 T T T T T`\n    *   (5, 9) is `T` (My own tail).\n    *   Moving into my own tail? My tail is at (3, 6) according to the description, but the map shows `T` at (5, 9).\n    *   If the map is accurate, (5, 9) is a body segment.\n    *   Moving RIGHT would hit my body. **DEAD.**\n    *   (Unless the tail moves away, but (5, 9) is adjacent to head. It is definitely body).\n\n**CORRECTION ON PAST MOVE:**\nThe prompt said \"START LAST MOVE PICK UP\". The map shows I am at (4, 9).\nThis confirms I moved UP to (4, 9) from (4, 8).\nSince I am at (4, 9), I cannot move UP (wall) or DOWN (self-collision).\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am on the top row.\nEnemy is at (8, 8).\nI need to secure the top left corner.\nI can move **LEFT** to (3, 9).\nFrom there, I can continue moving LEFT to (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9).\nThis will wall off the top row.\nThe enemy is on the right side (x=8). He is trapped in the right 2 columns essentially.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**LEFT** is the only safe move that progresses my goal of boxing him in.\nIf I go LEFT, I am safe. The enemy is at (8, 8). He cannot reach me this turn.\nNext turn, I can go LEFT again to (2, 9), securing more territory.\n\n**CHECKING FOR WIN CONDITION:**\nI have 15 apples. Enemy has 18.\nI need to eat apples to catch up, but I must prioritize survival and boxing.\nThe apples on the board are scattered. (8, 2) is far. (2, 8) is close.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 9), I am not eating an apple this turn.\nBut I am securing the top row.\nThe enemy is at (8, 8). He might go for an apple or try to escape.\nIf he goes DOWN, he leaves the top row to me.\nIf he goes LEFT towards me, he risks collision.\nI am longer (15 segments vs body segments, but count is irrelevant, position is key).\nI have the position to trap him.\n\n**VERDICT:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 9). Secure the top row. Trap the enemy in the corner.\n\nLEFT",

WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME NOW! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS:**\n\n**MY POSITION:**\nMy head is at **(3, 9)** (Top row, 4th column).\nMy body occupies (4, 9) down to (4, 5) and wraps around.\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 8) is safe? Let's check.\nThe board shows Row 8: `8 . . A . T T T 1 . T`\n(3, 8) is `.` (Empty).\nBut wait, my body is at (4, 8) according to the description? No, the description says my body is `[(4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7)...]`\nIf I am at (3, 9), my previous head was (4, 9). The segment (4, 9) becomes my neck.\nIs (3, 8) occupied by my body? No.\nIs (3, 8) occupied by enemy? No.\nIs (3, 8) safe from enemy moves? Enemy at (7, 7).\nIf I move DOWN, I am exposed. The enemy is at (7, 7). He wants to come left.\nIf I stay on the top row, I control the edge.\n\n**ANALYZING THE \"BOX IN\" STRATEGY:**\nMy goal is to trap Enemy #1 in the right side.\nEnemy Head: (7, 7).\nEnemy Body: Wraps all the way from (7, 8) up to (9, 9), down the right wall to (9, 0), and left to (4, 0).\nBasically, the enemy has a massive wall on the right side (x=4 to x=9).\nHe is currently at (7, 7).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2, 9), I secure more top-row territory.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 9) next turn, then **LEFT** to (0, 9), I own the entire top row.\nThe enemy cannot cross my body. If he tries to cross the top row to escape left, he has to hit my body.\nHis body blocks his escape down the right wall? No, his body IS the right wall.\nWait, let's look at his body again.\n`[(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]`\nHis body forms a perimeter from x=4 to x=9.\nHe is currently at (7, 7).\nHe is effectively trapped in the box x=4 to x=9, y=0 to y=8.\nIf I secure the top row (y=9) from x=0 to x=3, I am closing the lid on his box.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I open a gap. He might try to squeeze through (3, 8) -> (2, 8) to escape the right side.\nI cannot let him escape. I must wall him off.\n\n**MOVES:**\n1.  **UP:** (3, 10) -> **DEAD** (Wall).\n2.  **DOWN:** (3, 8) -> **SAFE** (Empty).\n    *   *Risk:* Exposes me. Enemy might move UP to (7, 8). He is far.\n    *   *Reward:* Maybe grab (2, 8) apple later? But it's risky.\n3.  **LEFT:** (2, 9) -> **SAFE** (Empty, verified on map).\n    *   *Risk:* None immediate.\n    *   *Reward:* Dominating the top edge. Trapping the enemy.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (4, 9) -> **DEAD** (My own body).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to lock down the top edge. The enemy is low at (7, 7). He is not a threat to the top row this turn.\nMoving **LEFT** advances my position to (2, 9).\nFrom (2, 9), next turn I can go LEFT to (1, 9), then (0, 9).\nOnce I hit (0, 9), I can spiral down and eat the apples on the left side (there's an apple at (0, 4)).\nThe enemy is trapped in the 4-9 zone. He has no way out. His own body blocks the bottom and right. I block the top.\nHe is dead in 10 turns. I win.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**\nSecure top row leftwards -> (0, 9) -> Spiral down left wall -> Eat apples -> Wait for enemy to die of starvation or try to break out and crash.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nLEFT",

LOOK CLOSER AT THE COORDINATES.**\nMy body is at **(4, 6)**.\nThe enemy head is at **(7, 6)**.\nThey are on the same row (y=6).\nThe distance between them is exactly 3 cells: (5, 6), (6, 6), and then (7, 6).\n**IS THE ENEMY GOING TO RAM MY BODY?**\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (6, 6), he hits my body at (5, 6)? No, (5, 6) is my body.\nIf he moves **LEFT** to (6, 6), he is safe this turn.\nIf he moves **LEFT** to (6, 6) and I stay still or move in a way that doesn't block him...\nWait, let's look at the board map provided in the prompt:\nRow 6: `. A A . T T T 1 . T`\nCoordinates:\n(0,6): .\n(1,6): A\n(2,6): A\n(3,6): .\n(4,6): T (My body)\n(5,6): T (My body)\n(6,6): T (My body)\n(7,6): 1 (Enemy Head)\n(8,6): .\n(9,6): T (Enemy Body)\n\n**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**\nMy body forms a wall from x=4 to x=6 on row 6.\nThe enemy is at x=7.\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT**, he goes to (6, 6).\n**(6, 6) IS OCCUPIED BY MY BODY.**\n**IF THE ENEMY MOVES LEFT, HE DIES.**\n\nDoes the enemy have other options?\n- **UP:** (7, 7). Is it safe? Row 7: `. . A . T T T T . T`. (7, 7) is `T` (My body at (4,7)? No, wait).\n  Let's check my body list: `(4, 7)` is in my body.\n  Is (7, 7) in my body? No.\n  Is (7, 7) in enemy body? Yes, `(7, 7)` is the second segment of his body!\n  **IF ENEMY MOVES UP TO (7, 7), HE HITS HIS OWN BODY. HE DIES.**\n- **RIGHT:** (8, 6). Row 8: `. . A . T T T 1 . T`. (8, 6) is `T` (Enemy Body).\n  **IF ENEMY MOVES RIGHT, HE HITS HIS OWN BODY. HE DIES.**\n- **DOWN:** (7, 5). Row 5: `. A A . . T T . . T`.

Row 8: `. . A . T T T 1 . T`. (2, 8) is `A` (Apple).\n    *   If I eat the apple at (2, 8), I grow.\n    *   But wait, if I move DOWN, do I block the enemy?\n    *   Enemy is forced to move DOWN to (7, 5) to survive.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2, 8), I am not interfering with the enemy's escape.\n    *   However, I need to consider the LONG GAME.\n    *   If I move LEFT, I secure the top edge.\n    *   If I move DOWN, I enter the board.\n    *   Let's look at the enemy's trap again.\n    *   Enemy is at (7, 6). His only escape is DOWN.\n    *   If I move **LEFT**, I am safe.\n    *   If I move **DOWN**, I eat an apple and gain a point (16 vs 18).\n    *   BUT, if I move DOWN, I am at (2, 8).\n    *   What if the enemy is actually trapped by the board state?\n    *   Let's re-verify the \"Enemy moves LEFT into my body\" theory.\n    *   Enemy at (7, 6). Left is (6, 6).\n    *   My body is at (6, 6). Correct.\n    *   Enemy at (7, 6). Up is (7, 7).\n    *   Enemy body is at (7, 7). Correct.\n    *   Enemy at (7, 6). Right is (8, 6).\n    *   Enemy body is at (8, 6). Correct.\n    *   **ENEMY IS TRAPPED.** He must move DOWN to (7, 5).\n    *   If he moves DOWN, he survives.\n    *   However, if he moves DOWN, he is further from the apples on the top right.\n    *   I am at (2, 9).\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (1, 9), I continue my plan to own the top row.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (2, 8), I eat an apple.\n    *   **RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n        *   **LEFT:** Safe, secures territory.\n        *   **DOWN:** Safe, eats apple.\n    *   **ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n        *   Enemy will be forced to move **DOWN** to (7, 5).\n        *   Why? Because Left/Up/Right are all self-collisions or wall collisions (Up is his body, Right is his body, Left is my body).\n    *   **RE-READING THE RULES:**\n        *   \"Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\"\n        *   \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\"\n    *   Is there a head-on collision risk?\n        *   My head is at (2, 9).\n        *   Enemy head is at (7, 6).\n        *   We are far apart.\n    *   **THE WIN CONDITION:**\n        *   I have 15 apples. Enemy has 18.\n        *   I need to close the gap.\n        *   The apple at (2, 8) is right there.\n        *   If I take it, I go to 16.\n        *   The enemy is forced to move DOWN to (7, 5).\n        *   From (7, 5), he is stuck in the bottom right corner (y=0 to y=5).\n        *   I am securing the top left (y=9, x=0-2).\n        *   This looks like a winning position.\n    *   **WAIT. IS THE ENEMY TRAPPED FOREVER?**\n        *   Enemy at (7, 6). Moving DOWN to (7, 5).\n        *   From (7, 5), can he go LEFT? (6, 5).\n        *   Row 5: `. A A . . T T . . T`.\n        *   (6, 5) is `T` (My body).\n        *   So if he moves LEFT from (7, 5), he hits my body.\n        *   Can he go UP? (7, 6). That's his previous spot, but will my body be there?\n        *   My body grows when I eat. If I eat (2, 8), my tail moves.\n        *   However, my body is currently at (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6).\n        *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 5), he is safe for this turn.\n        *   Next turn, he might be in trouble.\n    *   **DECISION:**\n        *   **DOWN** to (2, 8) is the aggressive play. It denies him the apple and scores a point.\n        *   **LEFT** to (1, 9) is the safe play. It secures the edge.\n        *   Since the enemy is effectively trapped in the bottom right quadrant (x>=4, y<=5) and I am dominating the top row, taking the apple seems optimal to increase score and length.\n\n    *   **LET'S DOUBLE CHECK THE ENEMY'S MOVES.**\n        *   Enemy at (7, 6).\n        *   Up (7, 7): Enemy body.\n        *   Right (8, 6): Enemy body.\n        *   Left (6, 6): My body.\n        *   Down (7, 5): Empty.\n        *   **Enemy MUST move DOWN.**\n\n    *   **MY MOVE: DOWN.**\n        *   Target: (2, 8).\n        *   Is (2, 8) occupied? No.\n        *   Is it an apple? Yes.\n        *   Is it safe from enemy collision? Yes, enemy is at (7, 5).\n\n    *   **PLAN:**\n        *   Move DOWN to (2, 8).\n        *   Grow to length 16.\n        *   Enemy moves DOWN to (7, 5).\n        *   Next turn, I can continue spiraling or look for more apples on the left side (like (0, 4)).\n\n    *   **FINAL CHECK:**\n        *   (2, 8) is empty according to the board map (Row 8: `. . A . T T T 1 . T` -> Index 2 is A).\n        *   (2, 8) is not my body.\n        *   (2, 8) is not enemy body.\n        *   I am not moving backwards into my own body (My body is to the right, I am moving down, that's perpendicular).\n        *   I am not moving off board.\n\n    *   **LET'S GO!**\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to eat the apple at (2, 8), growing to 16 points. The enemy is trapped at (7, 6) with only the DOWN move available, forcing him further into the corner. Next turn, I will likely pivot to the left to secure the corner or continue pressuring the trapped enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Their legal moves are **DOWN** to the apple at (2,7), **LEFT** to (1,8) or **RIGHT** to (3,8).

Go **DOWN** to (7,4).  \n   - Guarantees survival (no body or wall).  \n   - Keeps us in the open central corridor where we can keep moving **DOWN** toward the bottom\u2011row apple cluster (7,2, 6,3, 5,3, 4,3, 4,1).  \n   - Leaves multiple future options: after a few downs we can swing **LEFT** around our tail or even **RIGHT** into (8,4) later once the apple appears.\n\n2. Avoid **RIGHT** because it pushes us against the already\u2011crowded right wall (9,5 is occupied) and would quickly shrink our maneuvering space.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Long\u2011term vision**\n\n- Sweep down column\u202f7, eat the low\u2011row apples, then curl left around our tail (via (6,0) \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 \u2026) to claim the remaining bottom\u2011row fruit.  \n- Maintain a length advantage (18\u202fvs\u202f16) and stay away from the opponent\u2019s hunting ground at the top\u2011left.  \n- If the opponent ever drifts toward the centre, we can meet them head\u2011on where our higher score gives the knockout advantage.\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** The safest, most flexible move that also drives us toward a bounty of apples is **DOWN**.  \n\nDOWN",

We are in the endgame now! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's look at the board state after my last move **DOWN** to (2, 8).\nI successfully ate the apple and grew to **16 apples**.\nMy head is now at **(2, 8)**.\nMy body extends from (2, 9) down to (5, 6) (the tail moved forward).\n\n**THE ENEMY'S SITUATION:**\nThe enemy was at (7, 6) and was forced to move **DOWN** to (7, 5) to survive.\nWhy? Because his other options were blocked:\n- Left (6, 6): My body\n- Up (7, 7): His body\n- Right (8, 6): His body\nSo he moved **DOWN** to (7, 5).\nHis head is now at **(7, 5)**.\nHis body stretches down to (6, 0).\nHe has 18 apples.\n\n**CURRENT SCORES:**\n- **ME:** 16 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n- **ENEMY:** 18 apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nThe enemy is stuck in the bottom-right quadrant (y=0 to y=5, x=4 to x=9).\nI am dominating the top-left (y=6 to y=9, x=0 to x=6).\nI need to close the score gap.\nMy head is at (2, 8).\nAvailable apples nearby:\n- (2, 7) - RIGHT below me!\n- (1, 6)\n- (2, 6)\n- (0, 4)\n\n**MOVES ANALYSIS:**\n1.  **UP:** (2, 9). That's my previous head position. Moving backwards into my own body is **DEATH**. \u274c\n2.  **LEFT:** (1, 8). Is it safe? Yes. Is it an apple? No. I would miss the apple at (2, 7).\n3.  **RIGHT:** (3, 8). Is it safe? Let's check my body. My body is at (2, 9), (3, 9)... (3, 8) is NOT in my current body list. However, I need to check the board map. Row 8: `. . 0 . T T T 1 . T`. (3, 8) is `.` (Empty). It is safe.\n4.  **DOWN:** (2, 7). Is it safe? Let's check. Row 7: `. . A . T T T T . T`. (2, 7) is `A` (Apple). Is it in my body? No. Is it in enemy body? No.\n\n**CHOOSING THE MOVE:**\n- **LEFT** is safe but doesn't gain points.\n- **RIGHT** is safe but doesn't gain points.\n- **DOWN** is safe and **GIVES ME AN APPLE**.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 7), I eat the apple.\nMy score becomes **17**.\nThe enemy is at (7, 5).\nCan the enemy trap me?\nThe enemy is far away.\nCan the enemy reach me? No.\n\n**LONG TERM STRATEGY:**\nEat the apple at (2, 7) to close the gap to 17-18.\nNext turn, from (2, 7), I can go LEFT to (1, 7) or DOWN to (2, 6) (which is also an apple!).\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 7: `. . A . T T T T . T`\n(2, 7) is an apple.\nRow 6: `. A A . T T T T . T`\n(2, 6) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN now to (2, 7), next turn I can go DOWN to (2, 6) for another apple, bringing me to 18 (tying the enemy!).\nOr I can go LEFT to (1, 7) to start sweeping the left side.\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (2, 7) now, I am eating.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 8), I am safe but missing the apple.\nSince I am behind in score (16 vs 18), I MUST take every safe apple available to stay competitive.\nThe apple at (2, 7) is directly below me and completely safe.\n\n**MOVEMENT CHECK:**\nCurrent Head: (2, 8)\nMove: **DOWN**\nTarget: (2, 7)\nCheck Board Map Row 7: `. . A . T T T T . T` -> (2, 7) is A (Apple).\nCheck Body: My body occupies (2, 9) and onwards. (2, 7) is not in my body.\nCheck Enemy: Enemy is at (7, 5). (2, 7) is far away.\nCheck Collision: No head-on collision possible this turn as distance is large.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to secure the apple and close the score gap.\nThe enemy is cornered in the bottom right. I own the top.\nI will slowly spiral down and eat everything on the left side.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **DOWN:** +1 Apple (Score 17). Safe.\n- **LEFT:** No apple. Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** No apple. Safe.\n- **UP:** Death.\n\nWe are on a timer (Turn 47/150). We need points. We take the apple.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nDOWN",

Keeping the right\u2011wall tail intact preserves escape routes; we\u2019ll never be forced into a dead\u2011end because we still have the whole left side of the board open.\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term vision**\n\n- Sweep down column\u202f8, eat the low\u2011row apples (8,2\u202f &\u202f 7,2\u202f &\u202f 6,3\u202f &\u202f 5,3).  \n- Loop left around our tail once the bottom is cleared, then corral the opponent into the top\u2011left corner where their space is already cramped.  \n- Maintain the length advantage; with a higher score we can force a head\u2011on if they ever rush us.\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** Grab the apple, stay aggressive, and keep our options wide open.  \n\nRIGHT",

We are moving in for the kill! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLet's analyze the battlefield.\nMy head is at **(2, 8)**.\nLast turn I ate the apple at (2, 7) bringing my score to **17**.\nThe enemy is at **(7, 4)** (I assume he moved up or left, likely to chase an apple or escape the corner).\n\n**THE SCOREBOARD:**\n- **ME:** 17 Apples \ud83c\udf4e\n- **ENEMY:** 18 Apples \ud83c\udf4e\n\nI am one apple behind. I need to keep eating.\n\n**BOARD STATE & OPTIONS FROM (2, 8):**\n1.  **UP:** (2, 9).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 9 shows `T` at (2, 9).\n    -   **Analysis:** That's my own body (specifically, the segment connecting my head to the rest of my snake). Moving into my own body is **DEATH**.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u274c **KILLS ME.**\n\n2.  **DOWN:** (2, 7).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 7 shows `.` at (2, 7) (Empty).\n    -   **Analysis:** I just moved from here. The space is now empty.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE, BUT NO APPLE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (1, 8).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 8 shows `.` at (1, 8) (Empty).\n    -   **Analysis:** My body is not there. The enemy is nowhere near here.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE, BUT NO APPLE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (3, 8).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 8 shows `T` at (3, 8).\n    -   **Analysis:** My body occupies (3, 8). Looking at my body list: `..., (3, 9), (4, 9)...` Wait, actually my body is at (3, 9). Is (3, 8) occupied?\n    -   *Re-checking Board Map:* Row 8: `. . 0 . T T T 1 . T`. The `T` at index 3 (x=3) confirms (3, 8) is part of my body or an obstacle.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u274c **DEATH (Into my own body).**\n\n**WAIT, CHAT!** Let me double-check the board map visualization provided.\nRow 8: `. . 0 . T T T 1 . T`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n- (0,8): .\n- (1,8): .\n- (2,8): 0 (My Head)\n- (3,8): . (EMPTY)\n- (4,8): T\n- (5,8): T\n- (6,8): T\n- (7,8): 1 (Enemy Body)\n- (8,8): .\n- (9,8): T\n\nOkay, earlier I thought (3,8) was a T. The map says `(3,8)` is `.` (Dot).\nHowever, looking at my body list:\n`Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), ...]`\nWait, the body list includes my previous head position.\nCurrent Head: (2, 8).\nPrevious Head: (2, 7).\nBody List:\n1. (2, 8) - *Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (2, 7)\" for the last turn's replay.*\nLet's look at the **START OF THIS TURN** state.\n**Head: (2, 7)** (From last move Down).\n**Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9), ...]**\nSo my head is at (2, 7).\nWait, the prompt says: \"Turn: 48 / 150\" and \"Head: (2, 7)\".\nAh, the prompt says: \"MY SNAKE (ID: 0): - Head: (2, 7)\".\nBut the \"LAST MOVE REVIEW\" says I moved **DOWN** to (2, 8) in turn 47?\n**CONFLICT:**\nThe Board Map shows `0` at `(2, 7)` (Row 7, Column 2).\nRow 7: `. . 0 . T T T T . T`\nSo my head is actually at **(2, 7)**.\nThe \"LAST MOVE\" rationale I wrote previously (simulated for the turn before) assumed I moved to (2, 8) and ate (2, 7). But the Board Map provided for Turn 48 clearly places my `0` at `(2, 7)`.\n\n**CORRECTING MY POSITION:**\nMy Head: **(2, 7)**\nMy Body: The list provided starts with the head? No, lists are \"HEAD-TO-TAIL\". The first tuple is the head.\nThe list given: `[(2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)...]` IS THE BODY LIST?\nNo, the prompt says: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\nThen it lists:\n- Head: (2, 7)\n- Body: [(2, 8), (2, 9)...]\nThis means (2, 7) is the head. The *next* segment is (2, 8).\nSo my body occupies: (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5).\n\n**OPTIONS FROM HEAD (2, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP:** (2, 8).\n    -   **Check:** Is (2, 8) in my body? YES. It is the first element of my body list.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u274c **DEATH (Hit self).**\n\n2.  **DOWN:** (2, 6).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 6: `. A A . T T T T . T`. (2, 6) is `A` (Apple).\n    -   **Check:** Is (2, 6) in my body? No. Is it enemy body? No.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE + APPLE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (1, 7).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 7: `. . 0 . ...`. (1, 7) is `.` (Empty).\n    -   **Check:** Is (1, 7) in my body? No.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (3, 7).\n    -   **Board Map:** Row 7: `. . 0 . T T T T ...`. (3, 7) is `T` (My Body?).\n    -   **Check Body List:** My body includes (4, 7), (4, 6), etc. (3, 7) is NOT in the provided list.\n    -   **Wait, look at the Board Map again:**\n      Row 7: `. . 0 . T T T T . T`\n      Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n      - (3, 7) is `.` (Dot).\n      - (4, 7) is `T`.\n    -   So (3, 7) is empty.\n    -   **Verdict:** \u2705 **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI am at (2, 7). I need to catch up to the enemy (18 vs 17).\nThere is an apple directly below me at **(2, 6)**.\nThere is another apple at **(1, 6)** and **(2, 5)** nearby.\nThe enemy is at (7, 4).\nMoving **DOWN** to (2, 6) gives me an apple, bringing me to 18 (tying the score).\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 7) positions me to potentially sweep the left side, but I miss the apple right now.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (3, 7) moves me closer to the center but misses the apple.\n\nSince I am behind on apples (17 vs 18), I must eat.\n**DOWN** is the only move that gives an apple this turn.\nIs it safe?\n- (2, 6) is an apple.\n- It is not occupied by my body (my body starts at 2,8).\n- It is not occupied by the enemy (enemy is at 7,4).\n- It is not off-board.\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 6), where will the enemy move?\nThe enemy is at (7, 4).\nNearby apples for enemy: (8, 4), (8, 2), (7, 2).\nThe enemy is currently boxed in by his own tail at (9,0) area and (7,0).\nHe is likely to move towards the apples at (8, 4) or (8, 2).\nHe cannot reach (2, 6).\nNo head-on collision risk.\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove **DOWN** to eat the apple and tie the score 18-18.\n\nLet's look at the path.\nFrom (2, 7) DOWN to (2, 6).\nNext turn, from (2, 6), I have options:\n- (2, 5) is an apple (Row 5: `. A A . .` -> (2, 5) is `A`).\n- (1, 6) is an apple.\n- (3, 6) is `.` (Empty).\nI can chain apples.\n\n**ALPHA MOVE:** DOWN.\n\n**EMERGENCY CHECK:**\nIs (2, 6) blocked?\nRow 6: `. A A . T T T T . T`\n(2, 6) is `A`. Clear.\n\n**FINAL CONFIRMATION:**\nHead at (2, 7).\nMove DOWN to (2, 6).\n+1 Apple.\nScore 18.\nTie game.\nWe live to fight another turn.\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

Turn 49!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n- **My Head:** (2, 6)\n- **Enemy Head:** (8, 4)\n- **Score:** 18 - 19 (I am losing by 1 apple).\n\n**THE SITUATION:**\nI just ate the apple at (2, 6) last turn (according to the board map and my body growth). Wait, looking at the board map for **Turn 49**:\nRow 6: `. A 0 A T T T T . T`\nMy head is at **(2, 6)**.\nThere is an apple at **(1, 6)** (Left) and **(3, 6)** (Right) is empty.\nThere is an apple at **(2, 5)** (Down).\n\n**MOVES FROM (2, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP:** (2, 7)\n    - **Analysis:** (2, 7) is currently empty (it was my previous position last turn). My body follows behind.\n    - **Safety:** Safe.\n    - **Apple?** No.\n    - **Strategic Value:** Moves me up. The enemy is at (8, 4) and moving towards me (chasing apples at (6,3), (7,2)). Moving UP takes me away from the immediate apple cluster below but aligns me with the vertical strip of apples on the left/top side.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** (2, 5)\n    - **Analysis:** Looking at Row 5: `. A A . . T T T . T`.\n    - (2, 5) is `A` (Apple).\n    - **Safety:** Safe. Not my body (body starts at (2,6)). Not enemy body.\n    - **Apple?** YES! +1 Point. Score 19.\n    - **Strategic Value:** High. I eat immediately to tie the score 19-19. From (2, 5), I can likely go LEFT to (1, 5) (which is an apple) or DOWN to (2, 4) (which is empty). This keeps me in the \"Apple Zone\".\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (1, 6)\n    - **Analysis:** Row 6: `. A 0 ...`. (1, 6) is `A` (Apple).\n    - **Safety:** Safe.\n    - **Apple?** YES! +1 Point. Score 19.\n    - **Strategic Value:** High. Eating to tie the score. From (1, 6), I can go DOWN to (1, 5) (Apple) or LEFT to (0, 6) (Empty).\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (3, 6)\n    - **Analysis:** Row 6: `... 0 A ...`. (3, 6) is `.` (Empty).\n    - **Safety:** Safe.\n    - **Apple?** No.\n    - **Strategic Value:** Low. Moves me towards the center where the enemy might be approaching. I miss the apple at (1,6) or (2,5). Not ideal when I need to catch up.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to eat. I am trailing 18-19.\nBoth **DOWN** and **LEFT** provide an apple.\n- **LEFT (1, 6)** leads to (0,6) or (1,5). (0,6) is a wall eventually. (1,5) is an apple.\n- **DOWN (2, 5)** leads to (2,4) or (1,5). (1,5) is an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8, 4). They are far. They are likely chasing the apple at (8, 2) or (7, 2) or (6, 3).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2, 5), I am moving towards the horizontal row of apples at y=5 (1,5), (2,5), (4,3), (5,3). Wait, (4,3) and (5,3) are higher up.\nActually, (1, 5) is an apple.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (1, 6), (1, 5) is directly below.\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2, 5), (1, 5) is to my left.\n\nThe board is opening up on the left side.\n**DOWN** seems slightly safer because it keeps me away from the wall at x=0, maintaining a central-left position.\nHowever, **LEFT** grabs the apple at (1,6) which is currently isolated.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 6: `. A 0 A ...`\nRow 5: `. A A ...`\nRow 4: `A ...`\nThe cluster of apples is dense around (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6).\nI am at (2,6).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (1,6), I eat the apple there.\nFrom (1,6), I can go DOWN to (1,5) (Apple) or LEFT to (0,6).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2,5), I eat the apple there.\nFrom (2,5), I can go LEFT to (1,5) (Apple) or DOWN to (2,4).\n\nBoth are valid eats.\nThe enemy is at (8, 4). They are looking at (7,4) -> (7,3) -> (7,2) or (8,3) -> (8,2).\nThey are not interacting with my zone yet.\n\nI'll choose **LEFT**. Why?\nBecause it clears the apple at (1,6) which is slightly more \"out there\" on the edge.\nAlso, moving to (1,6) puts me adjacent to (1,5) (Apple) and (0,6) (Wall).\nWait, moving to the edge limits my escape routes.\n**DOWN** to (2,5) is more central. From (2,5) I have Left, Right, Down open.\nFrom (1,6) I have Down, Left (Wall), Right (Back).\nActually, (1,6) -> Left is (0,6) which is valid but a wall. (1,6) -> Right is (2,6) which I just left (safe).\n(2,5) -> Left is (1,5). (2,5) -> Right is (3,5). (2,5) -> Down is (2,4).\n\n(3, 5) is `.` (Empty - Row 5: `... . . T T`).\n(2, 4) is `.` (Empty - Row 4: `A . . . .`).\nSo (2,5) offers 3 safe directions (Left, Right, Down).\n(1,6) offers 2 safe directions (Down, Left(Edge)).\n\n**DOWN** to (2, 5) is the better tactical position.\nIt keeps me in the middle of the apple cluster.\nI eat the apple at (2,5).\nScore ties 19-19.\nI retain mobility.\n\n**LONG TERM PLAN:**\nTie score 19-19. Position in the center-left apple cluster (2,5). Look to sweep leftwards to (1,5) or clear the board to set up a kill on the enemy once I have a score lead. The enemy is in the top-right corner area (8,4). I have the bottom-left/center.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Wall:** No.\n- **Self:** No. (Body is at (2,6), (2,7)...)\n- **Enemy:** No. They are at (8,4).\n\n**GO!**\n\nDOWN",

Wastes a turn re-tracing steps.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** (2, 4)\n    - **Analysis:** Row 4 is `A . . . . . . . T T`.\n    - **Safety:** Safe.\n    - **Apple?** No.\n    - **Strategic Value:** Medium. Opens up the path to the bottom wall or the bottom-right corner.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** (1, 5)\n    - **Analysis:** Row 5 is `. A A . . T T T . T`. (1, 5) is an apple.\n    - **Safety:** Safe. (1, 5) is not my body (My body starts at (2,5) currently, but wait, if I move, my tail moves. Actually, checking my body list: Head is (2,5), Body is [(2,6)...]. So (1,5) is empty space).\n    - **Apple?** YES! +1 Point.\n    - **Strategic Value:** **HIGH.** I eat to go 20-19. From (1, 5), I am deep in the apple cluster (left of (2,5), above (1,4)). This gives me excellent control of the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** (3, 5)\n    - **Analysis:** Row 5: `... . . T T T . T`. (3, 5) is empty.\n    - **Safety:** Safe.\n    - **Apple?** No.\n    - **Strategic Value:** Low. Moves me away from the apple cluster on the left.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI need to extend my lead. The enemy is at (8, 3) in the bottom-right. I am safe in the bottom-left.\n**LEFT** to (1, 5) is the only move that grants an apple this turn.\nEating puts me at 20 apples. 20 > 19.\nFrom (1, 5), I can look at (1, 4) (Down), (0, 5) (Left - Apple listed in drops!), or (1, 6) (Up - Apple listed in drops!).\nActually, looking at the apple drops list: (0, 5) and (1, 6) are both apples.\nFrom (1, 5), I will be sandwiched between two apples (Up and Left).\nI will eat the apple at (1, 5).\nI will take the lead.\nI will dominate the board.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- **Wall:** No.\n- **Self:** No.\n- **Enemy:** No.\n\n**GO!**\n\nLEFT",

Apple available. High mobility.\n- **LEFT:** Safe. Apple available. Corner risk.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nTake the apple UP. Move to (1, 6). Secure the lead (21-20).

WOO! Now I'm looking at these options:\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Board shows `. . T A T T T T A T` at row 7. (1, 7) is empty. Safe. Good option to stay mobile.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** Board shows `A T T . . T T T . T` at row 5. (1, 5) is **T** (Enemy body!).

They will likely eat and grow.\nIf they go **LEFT** to (6, 2): Empty.\nIf they go **DOWN** to (7, 1): Empty.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI cannot move DOWN or RIGHT (Self-collision). I am forced between UP and LEFT.\nLEFT (0, 6) puts me in the corner, near the wall. That's a trap.\nUP (1, 7) keeps me in the game, central left side. It gives me access to (0, 7) and (2, 7) next turn.\nAlso, if the enemy goes UP to (7, 3) to eat that apple, I might be able to cut off their path or position for a head-on collision if I survive.\n\n**DECISION:**\nAvoid the wall. Avoid death.\n**UP** is the only move that keeps me alive and mobile.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\nUP",

My tail is at (6, 5).\n        *   If I move DOWN to (1, 6), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my second segment.\n        *   Since I am not eating an apple (I don't see one at (1, 6)), I will shrink.\n        *   My tail (6, 5) will vacate.\n        *   My head moves to (1, 6).\n        *   My body shifts: (1, 6) becomes the new head (temporarily), (1, 5) moves to (1, 6)? No.\n        *   Let's look at the coordinates:\n            *   Current: H(1, 7), B1(1, 6), B2(1, 5)...\n            *   Move DOWN: New H(1, 6).\n            *   New B1 is old H (1, 7).\n            *   New B2 is old B1 (1, 6).\n            *   **CRASH?** I am moving from (1, 7) to (1, 6). My body is *currently* at (1, 6).\n            *   Usually, moving into your own body segment (that isn't the tail) results in death.\n            *   Wait, looking at my body list: `[(1, 6), (1, 5), ...]`\n            *   My head is at (1, 7). The next segment is (1, 6).\n            *   Moving DOWN to (1, 6) is moving directly into my own neck.\n            *   **ELIMINATED:** DOWN is fatal (suicide).\n\n    *   **LEFT (0, 7):** Board shows `.` at (0, 7). Safe coordinates.\n        *   Is there an apple? No, apples are at (0, 4), (0, 5), etc.\n        *   Is it occupied by enemy? Enemy is at (6, 2) and snake body is mostly right side/center.\n        *   Safe.\n\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 7):** Board shows `A` at (2, 7) (visual grid).\n        *   Is it occupied by body?\n        *   My body: `[(1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)...]`\n        *   **OCCUPIED!** (2, 7) is part of my current body.\n        *   **ELIMINATED:** RIGHT is fatal.\n\n**SAFE MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGY & ENEMY PREDICTION:**\n*   **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (6, 2). Body is a long line mostly along the right side and top.\n*   **Apple at (6, 3):** Directly above the enemy head. This is a huge incentive.\n*   **Apple at (7, 3):** Also available.\n*   **Enemy likely move:** **UP** to (6, 3) or (7, 3). Let's assume UP.\n*   **My Position:** (1, 7).\n    *   If I go **UP** to (1, 8):\n        *   I am at Y=8.\n        *   Enemy is likely going to Y=3.\n        *   I am safe, but I'm moving closer to the top wall.\n        *   Top wall is Y=9. (1, 9) is **T** (Snake #1 body).\n        *   If I go UP to (1, 8), I have: (0, 8) [Empty], (1, 9) [Blocked by Enemy], (2, 8) [Enemy Body? Let's check grid: (2, 8) is **.** (Empty)].\n        *   So (1, 8) is relatively safe, but I'm boxed in near the top.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (0, 7):\n        *   I am at X=0, Y=7.\n        *   (0, 8) is Empty.\n        *   (0, 6) is Empty.\n        *   (0, 5) is Apple.\n        *   (0, 4) is Apple.\n        *   This gives me access to a vertical column of apples on the left wall.\n        *   The enemy is on the right side (X=6-9). We are spreading out.\n        *   **Crucial Check:** If the enemy goes UP to (6, 3), are we safe? Yes, huge distance.\n        *   **Head-on Collision:** To force a head-on collision, I need to meet the enemy. He is at Y=2/3, I am at Y=7. Hard to collide immediately.\n        *   **Long Term:** Going LEFT gives me the left edge. I can climb up or down.\n        *   Going UP puts me near the top, which is currently crowded by Enemy Body (Row 9 is almost full, Row 8 is crowded).\n\n**DECISION:**\nGoing **UP** is safe, but going **LEFT** opens up the left wall which seems clear and has apples (0, 5) and (0, 4). The enemy is on the right. I want to control the board. Left side is currently free real estate. Moving to (0, 7) allows me to spiral down the left side.\n\nHowever, (1, 8) is also safe. Let's look at the immediate threat.\nIf I go UP to (1, 8):\nNext moves: (0, 8) [Empty], (1, 9) [Blocked by Enemy], (2, 8) [Empty], (1, 7) [Empty].\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7):\nNext moves: (0, 6) [Empty], (0, 8) [Empty], (1, 7) [Empty].\n\nBoth are safe. BUT, if I go UP, I am at Y=8. If I want to turn around, I'm near the top wall. If I go LEFT to (0, 7), I am on the edge but have vertical freedom.\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 7: `. 0 T A T T T T A T`\nRow 6: `. T T A T T T T . T`\nRow 5: `A T T . . . T T . T`\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7):\nI am at (0, 7).\nFrom there, I can go DOWN to (0, 6) -> (0, 5) (Apple!) -> (0, 4) (Apple!).\nThis is a clear path to gain score.\nIf I go UP to (1, 8):\nI am at (1, 8).\n(1, 9) is blocked by Enemy. (0, 8) is empty. (2, 8) is empty.\nI am in a \"tunnel\" at the top.\n\nThe enemy is gathering apples on the right (6, 3). I should secure the left side.\n(0, 7) is the best move to pivot to the left wall.\n\n**LET'S GOOOO!**\n\n**PLAN:** Secure the left wall. Move to (0, 7). Then drop down to (0, 6) -> (0, 5) (Apple) -> (0, 4) (Apple). This scores 2 points and gives me vertical control while the enemy is on the right.\n\nLEFT",

My plan was to go DOWN to collect the apples on the left edge (0, 5 and 0, 4).\n*   **UP** to (0, 8): Safe, but leads to dead ends at (0, 9) or (1, 9). No apples up there. Bad long term.\n*   **DOWN** to (0, 6): Safe. Next step is (0, 5) which has an **APPLE**. After that, (0, 4) has another **APPLE**. This is 2 guaranteed points and keeps me safe on the edge where the enemy isn't.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**DOWN** is the clear winner. I secure the left flank, grab points, and stay away from the enemy's territory on the right.\n\n**PLAN:**\nSecure the left column. Move DOWN to (0, 6) -> (0, 5) [Apple] -> (0, 4) [Apple].

Now the enemy is at (4, 3) and we need to push into the center to take control.\n\n**TURN 56 ANALYSIS:**\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Head:** (0, 5) (Just moved DOWN last turn)\n*   **My Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), ...]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 3) (Likely moving toward the apple at (3, 3) or (5, 2))\n*   **Enemy Body:** [(5, 3), (6, 3), ...]\n\n**MOVES & SAFETY CHECK:**\n1.  **UP (0, 6):** That's my NECK. I just came from there. **DEATH.**\n2.  **LEFT (-1, 5):** Off the board. **DEATH.**\n3.  **DOWN (0, 4):** Let's check the board. `(0, 4)` is an **APPLE**. Is it safe? The enemy is at x=4. They cannot reach x=0 in one move. There are no bodies there. **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 5):** Let's check. `(1, 5)` is empty. The enemy body is far to the right. **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to eat an apple, or RIGHT to start invading the center.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (1, 5)**, I open up paths to the cluster of apples at (3, 3), (5, 2), (4, 4). This is the aggressive play to cut off the enemy who is currently at (4, 3). If I go DOWN to (0, 4), I'm safe and I grow, but I'm staying on the edge while the enemy fights for the center apples. To win, I need to dominate the center and box him in. The enemy is at (4, 3) and his body trails down the right side. If I push RIGHT now, I can threaten his position and force him to react.\n\n**DECISION:**\n**RIGHT** is the move. It positions me at (1, 5), putting me two steps away from the critical apple at (3, 3) or (5, 2) and putting pressure on the enemy who is hovering around x=4. I need to invade his territory to crash him out.\n\n**PLAN:**\nPush RIGHT to (1, 5). Next turn, aim for (2, 5) or (1, 4) depending on where the enemy moves. We need to cut off his escape route and force a head-on collision or a wall trap.\n\nLet's box him in! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nRIGHT",
