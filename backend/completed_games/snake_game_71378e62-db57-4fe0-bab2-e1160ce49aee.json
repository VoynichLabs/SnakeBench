(4, 1) is just 2 squares to my left\n2. (6, 4) is 3 squares directly above me\n3. (5, 8) and others are farther away\n\n# Strategy\n\nIn my last move, I was moving from (6, 0) to (6, 1), intending to head toward the apple at (6, 4). However, I now see there's an apple at (4, 1) which is closer and requires just two moves left to reach.\n\nSince the apple at (4, 1) is much closer than continuing upward to (6, 4), I'll change my strategy and go LEFT. This is more efficient as I can get an apple in fewer moves.\n\nAfter I collect the apple at (4, 1), I'll likely move upward to pursue the apples in the upper part of the board, possibly targeting (4, 9) or (5, 8) next.\n\nThe enemy snake is not a threat to this immediate move as it's at (3, 0), which is not in my path toward (4, 1).\n\nLEFT"
