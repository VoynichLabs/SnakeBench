This was a safe move that kept me away from the walls and the other snake's body.\n\nNow, I need to reassess the board state and plan my next move.\n\nThe closest apple from my current position is at (6, 4), which is 3 steps away (2 steps right and 1 step down).

This path could potentially be safer as it keeps me further away from the enemy snake's current position.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the long-term implications of my moves.

My length remains 5 since I did not eat an apple last turn.\n- The apple positions remain unchanged:\n   - (7,8), (4,8), (7,0), (1,1), (1,9)\n- Immediate threats:\n   - Enemy snake #2 at position (6,6) with no body segments. Snake #2 is fairly close, just to my left and up from my position, potentially competing for the apples at (7,8) or (4,8).\n- Apples at (7,8) and (7,0) are directly vertical from my current position and remain clearly accessible.\n- Apple at (7,8) is closest: 3 moves directly UP.\n- Apple at (7,0) is farther (5 moves DOWN) but is less contested by enemy snake #2.\n\nEvaluating immediate moves safety:\n- LEFT to (6,5) is safe immediately, but moves toward enemy snake.\n- RIGHT to (8,5) is safe immediately, moving away from enemy snake, but offers no immediate strategic advantage (no nearby apple, no immediate threat).\n- DOWN to (7,4) would collide with my own body\u2014unsafe; I must avoid moving DOWN at this time.\n- UP to (7,6) is safe and aligns perfectly with apple at (7,8).\n\nStrategic reasoning:\n- Moving UP continues to be the ideal choice. It quickly positions me to grab the apple at (7,8).\n- Enemy snake #2 could potentially move right to (7,6) next turn, creating a collision hazard in the following turns, but right now this square (7,6) remains empty and available.\n- After moving UP, carefully check next turn to confirm enemy snake #2's action:\n   - If enemy moves towards (7,7) or (7,8), I might need a precautionary move (like going RIGHT next turn) to prevent collision.\n   - If enemy stays clear of my vertical path, continue UP to grab apple at (7,8) safely.\n\nThus, continue towards apple (7,8) for growth and points, while closely monitoring enemy snake #2 next turn.\n\nFuture strategy reminder for the next turns:\n- Closely observe enemy snake #2. If it is positioning aggressively near apple at (7,8), adjust your trajectory to evade or contest safely.\n- After apple (7,8), reassess: consider apples at (4,8) or (1,9), based on enemy snake positions. Keep a backup plan in mind.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
