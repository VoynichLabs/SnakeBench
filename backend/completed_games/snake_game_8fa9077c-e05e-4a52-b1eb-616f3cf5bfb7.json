          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state and plan a move step by step.\n\n### Current State Recap:\n- **Your snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (8, 2)\n  - Body: None (just a single segment)\n  - Apples collected: 0\n- **Enemy snake (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (0, 6)\n  - Body: None\n- **Apples available:**\n  - (7, 6), (7, 0), (1, 9), (9, 8), (9, 1)\n- **Board layout:**\n  - Your snake is at (8, 2), which is near the right edge (x=9 is the far right).\n  - Enemy snake is at (0, 6), which is near the left edge (x=0 is the far left).\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate Immediate Threats\n- **Off the board:** Moving up from (8, 2) would go to (8, 3) (valid), moving down would go to (8, 1) (valid), moving left would go to (7, 2) (valid), moving right would go to (9, 2) (valid). No immediate off-board issues.\n- **Into own body:** Since your snake is just a single segment, no risk of hitting yourself.\n- **Into enemy body:** Enemy is at (0, 6). Moving left from (8, 2) would go to (7, 2), which is not adjacent to (0, 6). Moving right would go to (9, 2), which is not adjacent to (0, 6). Moving up or down would not directly threaten the enemy either. So no immediate collision risk.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves\nAll four directions are safe. Now, let's evaluate each move based on:\n1. Closeness to apples.\n2. Future options (avoiding traps).\n3. Avoiding head-on collisions with enemy.\n\n#### Apple Closeness:\n- **Up (8, 3):** Closest to (7, 6) (distance 1 in x, 1 in y) and (7, 0) (distance 1 in x, 2 in y). Also near (9, 8) and (9, 1).\n- **Down (8, 1):** Closest to (9, 1) (distance 1 in x, 1 in y).\n- **Left (7, 2):** Closest to (7, 0) (distance 0 in x, 2 in y).\n- **Right (9, 2):** Closest to (9, 8) and (9, 1) (distance 1 in x, 6 in y and 7 in y).\n\n#### Future Options:\n- **Up:** Moves toward the top-left corner, which is a potential trap if enemy moves toward you. But since enemy is at (0, 6), moving up would not immediately threaten them.\n- **Down:** Moves toward the bottom-right corner, which is less likely to be a trap unless enemy moves aggressively.\n- **Left:** Moves toward the left edge, which is where enemy is. Enemy could move toward you, but since your snake is small, this is less risky.\n- **Right:** Moves toward the right edge, which is safer for now.\n\n#### Avoiding Head-on Collisions:\n- Enemy is at (0, 6). If you move left to (7, 2), enemy could move right to (1, 6) and then collide with you if you move left again. But since this is the first move, no immediate collision risk.\n- Enemy could move up or down, but since your snake is small, no immediate danger.\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Apple Eating\nThe closest apple to your current position (8, 2) is (7, 6) at a distance of sqrt((8-7)^2 + (2-6)^2) = sqrt(1 + 16) = sqrt(17) \u2248 4.12 units. But since you can only move one step at a time, the closest reachable apple in one move is (7, 6) if you move up to (8, 3) and then up again, but that's two moves. However, (7, 6) is reachable in two moves if you move up first.\n\nBut let's check if you can eat an apple in one move:\n- (7, 6) is not adjacent to (8, 2) (distance is sqrt(1 + 16) = sqrt(17) > 1).\n- (7, 0) is not adjacent.\n- (1, 9) is far away.\n- (9, 8) is far away.\n- (9, 1) is far away.\n\nSo no apple is adjacent to your head. Thus, no immediate apple to eat.\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy\n- **Grow quickly:** Since no apples are adjacent, you need to grow by expanding your body. But since your snake is just a single segment, you need to move toward apples to grow.\n- **Avoid enemy:** Enemy is at (0, 6). Moving right or down seems safer.\n- **Expand territory:** Moving right to (9, 2) is a good move to expand toward the right edge, which is less crowded.\n\n### Step 5: Final Decision\nGiven that no immediate apple is reachable, and all directions are safe, moving right to (9, 2) is a good choice to expand your territory and avoid potential enemy aggression.\n\n### Long-term plan for future self:\n- **Turn 1:** Move right to (9, 2).\n- **Turn 2:** Evaluate if you can move toward (7, 6) or (9, 1) to grow.\n- **Turn 3:** Continue expanding toward the right or top-left, depending on enemy movements.\n\n---\n\n**UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT:** RIGHT",
