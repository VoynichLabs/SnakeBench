No bodies to worry about yet, and both scores are 0 \u2014 time to be aggressive but smart. I\u2019ll walk through the thinking so the chat knows what\u2019s up.\n\nConsidered moves (HEAD -> destination):\n- UP -> (3,9): legal. Moves me to the top row (limits future UP). Safe this turn.\n- DOWN -> (3,7): legal. Keeps me more central and flexible.\n- LEFT -> (2,8): legal. Moves toward apple at (1,8) eventually, safe.\n- RIGHT -> (4,8): legal. Moves me toward the enemy\u2019s side of the board and toward the apple at (4,7) below.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- No immediate collisions possible this turn \u2014 opponent (9,9) is too far to force a head-on right now.\n- No bodies or backwards restrictions to eliminate any move.\n\nWhy I PICK a move: we want options open and to start pressuring the rival into the corner while staying able to pivot for apples. Going UP would cap vertical mobility immediately. LEFT drifts away from the opponent. DOWN is safe and central, but I want to be more aggressive and start nudging toward the right side to hem them in.\n\nShort-term tactic (plan for next few turns):\n- Push rightward to shift the fight toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant while snatching nearby apples (like (4,7)) to build a lead.\n- Keep my body length short enough initially to remain maneuverable; avoid top-row entrapment.\n- When I have apples advantage, force head-on or cut off escape routes near the top-right corner to try to KO them.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Pressure them toward the right/top border, then trap with a sweep from below/left.\n- Prioritize creating a situation where they have fewer safe moves than I do \u2014 that\u2019s when we risk a head-on if we\u2019ve got the score advantage.\n\nFinal decision \u2014 be aggressive, keep options, approach the enemy: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

Apples nearby (notably at 4,7), but the enemy is up and right \u2014 time to apply pressure.\n\nConsider moves:\n- UP -> (4,9): legal but puts me on the top row and immediately reduces vertical escape options.

Good for early lead, but it pulls me down away from directly pressuring their top-right corner.\n- LEFT -> (3,8): legal but drifts away from the fight \u2014 too passive for this early phase.\n- RIGHT -> (5,8): legal, aggressive, keeps multiple follow-ups (up/down/right/left available next turn), and starts shifting the conflict toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant.\n\nSafety check: no immediate collisions this turn \u2014 opponent is too far to force a head-on this move. Opponent at (8,9) cannot go UP, so they\u2019re already constrained; forcing them toward the right/top edge is advantageous.\n\nTactical plan (next few turns): push right to close distance and create lateral pressure on their escape routes.

Apples exist but we\u2019re NOT chasing them blindly. We want to shrink their options and force mistakes.\n\nConsidered moves:\n- UP -> (5,9): legal but sticks me to the top edge (reduces vertical escapes). Could help box them, but hurts our flexibility.\n- DOWN -> (5,7): legal, moves toward apples (4,7) a bit, but pulls me away from immediate pressure.\n- LEFT -> (4,8): legal but passive \u2014 retreats from the fight.\n- RIGHT -> (6,8): legal, aggressive, closes distance to (7,9) while keeping multiple exits (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) next turn.\n\nSafety check: no immediate collisions this turn. Opponent at (7,9) cannot go UP; their safe moves are LEFT (6,9), DOWN (7,8), or RIGHT (8,9). None create an instant head-on with our RIGHT move now.\n\nTactical call: go RIGHT. Why? It maintains max pressure, keeps our follow-ups flexible (we won\u2019t be pinned to the top row), and nudges the battle toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant so we can start boxing them. We avoid head-on this turn (scores are tied \u2014 don\u2019t risk a mutual death). If they fold downward later, we pivot for apples and trap; if they hug the edge, we sweep horizontally to cut exits. Only go for a head-on if we\u2019ve earned a points lead.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Keep compressing space between us and #0 by forcing lateral movement.\n- If they slip down, prioritize turning their exit into a dead-end and grab nearby apples to convert pressure into a scoring advantage.\n- Never get pinned on the top row; preserve at least 2 escape options each turn unless a guaranteed win-by-collision is available.\n\nLET\u2019S DO IT \u2014 full send.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT keeps three safe follow-ups (UP/RIGHT/DOWN), puts us in position to threaten (6,7) next turn to compress their space toward the wall, and lets us pivot toward apples like (6,6) if they slip.
