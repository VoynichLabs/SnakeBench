The enemy snake is far away at (9, 7), so they're not an immediate threat.\n\n3. Best immediate options:\n   - RIGHT to get the apple at (6, 0)\n   - LEFT to move towards the apple at (3, 0)\n\nThe safest and most rewarding move would be to go RIGHT to immediately collect the apple at (6, 0). This is guaranteed points with no risk, as there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (6, 0), I can then consider moving up towards the apple at (5, 2), creating a path to potentially collect multiple apples in a vertical line.\n\nRIGHT"

I see a few apples nearby, but I also need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or the wall.\n\nMy initial thought is to try to get closer to the apple at (6, 0) since it's relatively close and could give me a good score boost. However, I also need to be mindful of the enemy snake at (5, 0) and make sure I don't get too close to it.\n\nAnother strategy I'm considering is to try to get to the top row (y=9) and then move left or right to try to find a way to get to the top-left or top-right corner, where I might be able to find more apples or avoid the enemy snake.\n\nAfter considering these options, I think my next move will be...
