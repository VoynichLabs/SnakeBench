The enemy snake #1 is at (0,7) with no body.\n\nThe board coordinates are from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right. The visual representation shows:\n- Row 9 (top): . A . . . A . . A .\n- Row 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 7: 1 . . . . A . . A .\n- Row 6: A . A . A . . . A .\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 4: . . A . . . . .

A A .\n\nMy current position: (9,4) - right edge\nAvailable moves from (9,4):\n- UP: (9,5) - empty\n- DOWN: (9,3) - empty\n- LEFT: (8,4) - my body segment (this would be moving directly backwards into my own body, which is not allowed - I would die)\n- RIGHT: off board - would die\n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT are invalid. I must choose between UP to (9,5) or DOWN to (9,3).\n\nNow consider apples:\n- (9,5) has no apple\n- (9,3) has no apple\n- But near my current position, I see apples at (8,6) and (8,7) which are UP and LEFT/UP from my current position\n\nThe enemy snake #1 at (0,7) is far away and shouldn't immediately threaten me. However, I need to think about future positioning.\n\nIf I go UP to (9,5):\n- Next turn I'll be at (9,5), body [(9,4), (8,4)]\n- From there I could go LEFT to (8,5) or UP to (9,6) or DOWN to (9,4) (which is now my body, so risky)\n- (8,5) is empty and has an apple at (8,6) nearby\n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,3):\n- Next turn I'll be at (9,3), body [(9,4), (8,4)]\n- From there I could go LEFT to (8,3), DOWN to (9,2), or UP to (9,4) (my body)\n- (8,3) is empty and has an apple at (7,3) nearby\n\nBoth directions seem safe. UP leads me toward apples at (8,6) and (8,7) in the upper right. DOWN leads me toward apples at (7,0), (8,0) in the lower right.\n\nSince I'm already on the right edge, I want to avoid getting trapped. Moving UP gives me more room to maneuver along the top edge. Also, the enemy is at (0,7) which is in the upper left, so moving UP on the right side keeps me away from potential conflict zones.\n\nLet me choose UP to (9,5) to maintain flexibility and head toward the cluster of apples at (8,6), (8,7), and (8,9).\n\nUP",

LEFT to (8, 5) seems better because it keeps me off the right edge, reducing risk of getting trapped. From (8, 5), I can go to (7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), or back to (9, 5). From (9, 6), I'm still on the edge with fewer options.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake is at (1, 6) with its body at (0, 6).\n\nI need to evaluate my possible moves from (8, 5):\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** This cell contains an apple ('A'). It is currently empty of snakes. The enemy snake is far away at (1, 6). Moving here allows me to eat the apple, grow, and open up the upper right area. This seems like a strong move.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** This cell is empty (board shows '.' at row 4, column 8). It is safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** This cell is empty (board shows '.' at row 5, column 7). It is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** This is my own body (head is moving to (8, 5), tail is at (9, 5) currently). Moving right would put my head back onto the cell I just left, which is now occupied by my body. This is a collision and would cause me to die. I cannot move right.\n\nI eliminate RIGHT as a fatal move.\n\nNow comparing the safe moves:\n-   **UP to (8, 6):** Pros: Eats an apple (growth + score), moves towards the cluster of apples in the upper right ((8, 7), (8, 9), (7, 9), (5, 9)). Cons: Slightly moves me towards the top edge, but (8, 6) is very accessible.\n-   **DOWN to (8, 4):** Pros: Moves toward the center of the board. Cons: No immediate apple reward.\n-   **LEFT to (7, 5):** Pros: Moves toward the center. Cons: No immediate apple reward.\n\nThe move UP to (8, 6) is the most rewarding immediate action. It secures a point and positions me to chase the high-density apple cluster in the top right corner, which is currently unoccupied by the enemy snake. The enemy snake is in the bottom left and poses no immediate threat to this area. Even if the enemy snake moves toward me, the distance is large enough that I have several turns to maneuver.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After eating at (8, 6), I will be at (8, 6) with my body trailing through (8, 5) and (9, 5). I should likely move to (8, 7) next to eat the adjacent apple, continuing to dominate the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

(8, 7) is not in my body.\n   *   Moving UP is safe and eats an apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 5)**:\n   *   (8, 5) is currently my body (the segment behind my head).
