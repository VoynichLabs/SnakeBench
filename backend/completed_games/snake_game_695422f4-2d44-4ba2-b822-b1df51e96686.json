The only deadly directions are LEFT (out of bounds) \u2013 that\u2019s an instant KO.  \n\n\u2705 **UP** \u2192 (0,9) empty, but the juicy apple is at (1,9) two steps away and we\u2019d have to swing right later, risking a wall\u2011hug.  \n\u2705 **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,8) empty, also leads toward the (1,9) apple but puts us right on the open corridor where the opponent could possibly cut us off later.  \n\u2705 **DOWN** \u2192 (0,7) empty, and **straight down** we\u2019ve got a sweet apple waiting at **(0,5)** after just a couple more moves. No opponent traffic, tons of wiggle room, and we stay snug against the wall where we can snake around it later.\n\nOur rival\u2019s head is way over at (7,3) \u2013 no immediate clash either way, but keeping the left side free gives us the chance to dart up, down, or slide right later without getting boxed in. Plus, grabbing that (0,5) apple early boosts our score and length, making future head\u2011on battles in our favor. \ud83c\udfaf\ud83e\ude93  \n\n**Short\u2011term game plan:**  \n1. Drop **DOWN** to (0,7).  \n2. Keep the vertical corridor open and snag the apple at (0,5) on the next couple of turns.  \n3. Once we\u2019re a bit longer, swing right, control the left side, and start hemming the opponent in.  \n\nLet\u2019s get that apple and stay alive! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nDOWN",

We're eyeballin' this rival snake lurkin' at (0,8) over yonder, but nah, he's just a head like us\u2014 ain't no threat YET, haha. My boy's at (7,3), fresh and clean, no body to worry about, zero apples, but we're about to CHANGE that, aren't we?? Grow fast, dominate the board, box this fool in and make him crumple!! Don't get sloppy, stay safe, avoid that head-on nonsense with a tied score\u2014double KO? No thanks, we want the W, not a draw! Focus on EATING, getting that lead, then hunt!\n\nAll moves are SAFE, folks\u2014no walls, no bodies, no backwards hits. UP to (7,4)? Keeps options open, middlin' the board, but no apple there yet. DOWN to (7,2)? Copy, but again, no immediate chomp. LEFT to (6,3)? Same deal, safe and simple. But RIGHT?? Ohhh, chat, RIGHT to (8,3)\u2014that's right into a JUICY apple, baby! Grow to 1 segment, score to 1, BODY extends back to (7,3), and we flex on that zero-points loser. Why waste time? Eat now, dominate later\u2014pure skill play! Keeps me closer to more apples in row 2 and 3, options WIDE open, no trap in sight.\n\nLong-term plan for my future CHAMP self: After this grow, we're at HEAD (8,3), BODY (7,3). Next turn, scan for enemy moves\u2014could he go RIGHT to (1,8) or whatever? But don't partner dance with the head. Instead, YOLO towards the left outer area to start boxing that nerd in the top-left corner. If he grows too, force him towards walls or apples that'll trap him. Grab apples opportunistically, build to 5-10, then sandwich him into a crash. Stay aggressive, no mercy, make him regret challengin' us!!\n\nRIGHT<|control576|>RIGHT",

The opponent is still on the opposite side of the board; none of their possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) can reach (2,\u202f5) this turn, so there\u2019s no risk of a head\u2011on clash.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1. **Turn\u202f5:** move **RIGHT** to (2,\u202f5) and grab the apple.  \n2. After growing, start steering toward the central columns (x\u202f=\u202f4\u20116) where the opponent\u2019s path will be tighter, preparing to cut off his escape routes.\n\nStaying aggressive, taking the apple, and gaining length is the optimal move right now.\n\nRIGHT",

Its viable moves are:  \n- **UP** into (0,3) \u2192 would hit our body \u2192 instant KO for them.  \n- **RIGHT** into (1,2) \u2192 hits its own body \u2192 KO.  \n- **DOWN** into (0,1) (apple) \u2192 the only safe option.  \n\nSo they\u2019ll most likely dive down for the apple at (0,1). That leaves the column\u20110 corridor open for us to control.\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move gives us the best future?**  \n- **RIGHT** would whisk us away from the column\u20110 choke point. It\u2019s a decent escape, but it also gives the enemy more room to later swing up the board.  \n- **UP** keeps us marching up the left wall, tightening the no\u2011go zone for the rival\u2019s head. Staying on column\u202f0 denies them any upward escape and forces them to keep heading down, where they\u2019ll grow and become a longer, slower target.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Long\u2011term plan:**  \n- Keep marching **UP** along the left edge, hugging the wall.  \n- When the opponent is forced down and starts looping right, we\u2019ll swing right at just the right moment to cut off their path and box them into a corner.  \n- With our score a few apples behind, we need to dominate space, not chase every fruit.  \n\nSo the aggressive, space\u2011controlling move is **UP**. Let\u2019s lock that in and keep the pressure!  \n\nUP",

Moving **UP** lets us continue climbing the empty column, limiting the rival\u2019s escape routes.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Force the opponent further down the corridor (they\u2019ll be at (1,0) after this turn), giving us space to swing right at the top and cut them off.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Preserve growth opportunities: the apple at (1,9) lies just right of the top of this wall \u2013 staying on column\u202f0 sets us up for a clean grab later.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Decision**  \n- **UP** is the safest, most pressure\u2011building choice.

It lets us snake along the left side while the tail vacates the bottom of column\u202f0, eventually giving us the option to swing left and cut the opponent off.\n2. **Apple pipeline** \u2013 The next apple on the board is at **(2,\u202f8)**. By moving to (1,\u202f8) we sit right next to it, ready to scoop it up on the following turn with a simple right move.\n3. **Boxing the rival** \u2013 The enemy is crammed near the bottom left. As we slide down the left edge we\u2019ll shrink his escape corridor and force him into a corner where a head\u2011on collision or a wall bite becomes inevitable.\n4. **No collision risk** \u2013 The opponent can\u2019t reach (1,\u202f8) this turn, and no other snake is nearby, so the move is 100\u202f% safe.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f17**: \u2193 to (1,\u202f8) (no apple, tail shortens, freeing (0,\u202f5)).  \n- **Turn\u202f18**: \u2192 to (2,\u202f8) and eat the apple at (2,\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f19\u2011\u2026**: Continue hugging the left wall, then swoop left once the tail clears, boxing the opponent against the bottom edge and looking for the next cluster of apples (e.g., (3,\u202f7), (4,\u202f8), (6,\u202f8)).  \n\nLet\u2019s press that button and start the hunt.  \n\nDOWN",

No chance of a head\u2011on collision with us right now.\n\n**\u2705 Safe directions for us**\n\n| Dir | Target | Occupied? | Apple? | Future freedom |\n|-----|--------|-----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **UP**   | (2,\u202f9) | empty |\u202f\u2716 | After moving up we\u2019d be cornered \u2013 only **RIGHT** stays safe. |\n| **DOWN** | (2,\u202f7) | empty |\u202f\u2716 | Opens three exits (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) and a quick apple at (3,\u202f7) next turn. |\n| **RIGHT**| (3,\u202f8) | empty |\u202f\u2716 | Leads straight into the **apple river**: (4,\u202f8), (6,\u202f8), (7,\u202f8), (8,\u202f8). Two safe follow\u2011ups (UP or RIGHT) and a guaranteed apple on the next move. |\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Why we pick **RIGHT****\n\n1. **Apple pipeline** \u2013 Row\u202f8 is loaded with apples. From (3,\u202f8) we can snap **(4,\u202f8)** next turn, then keep marching right for more points.  \n2. **Maintain mobility** \u2013 After moving right we still have two solid options (UP or another RIGHT), so we don\u2019t get trapped against the top wall.  \n3. **Opponent far away** \u2013 The rival can\u2019t reach (3,\u202f8) this turn, eliminating any risk of a deadly head\u2011on.  \n4. **Score pressure** \u2013 We\u2019re two apples behind. Grabbing the high\u2011density cluster quickly shrinks that gap and gives us the length needed to start boxing the opponent later.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f18:** \ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT** to (3,\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f19:** If the square (4,\u202f8) still holds an apple, grab it (RIGHT again).  \n- **Turn\u202f20\u201122:** Sweep rightward across the top row, snatching the apples at (6,\u202f8), (7,\u202f8) and (8,\u202f8).  \n- **After the cluster:** Slip down to row\u202f6 to claim the (6,\u202f6) apple, then start looping around the centre, forcing the opponent\u2019s tail to stay glued to the left wall while we control the open space.\n\nKeep the head high, the apples coming, and the opponent boxed in. Let\u2019s eat up and dominate!  \n\n**RIGHT**",

Instant death. \u274c  \n- **UP** \u2192 (5,\u202f9) is free, but it gives no apple and puts me on the edge with only one way back out. \ud83d\ude2c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,\u202f7) is empty, safe, but still no apple.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,\u202f8) holds a fresh apple! \ud83c\udfaf I\u2019ll grow, score another point, and stay in the sweet corridor where the next two apples sit at (7,\u202f8) and (8,\u202f8).

The rival can never cross above y\u202f8 without dying, forcing him to stay trapped in the lower\u2011left quadrant.\n2. **Apple runway** \u2013 From (9,\u202f8) I can simply go **DOWN** each turn and harvest the cascade of apples at (9,\u202f6), (9,\u202f5), (9,\u202f4)\u2026 giving me a steady point lead while he scrambles for the sparse apples in the centre.\n3. **Future freedom** \u2013 Even after the wall is built, I still have multiple escape routes (down the right edge, left along the top row, or up then left) so I won\u2019t get cornered.\n4. **Opponent\u2019s next options** \u2013 He can only move to (4,\u202f5), (4,\u202f3) or (5,\u202f4). None of those intersect my intended path, so there\u2019s no risk of a head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\nGiven the safety, the aggressive positioning, and the apple\u2011rich corridor I\u2019m about to seize, the optimal choice is to **extend the wall** and start the right\u2011column apple run.\n\n**Move**\n\nRIGHT",

Grab them and I\u2019ll surge ahead!  \n\n**\ud83d\udea6 Legal Moves from (9,\u202f8)**  \n\n| Move | Destination | Safety | Apple? |\n|------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| **UP**   | (9,\u202f9) | Empty, on\u2011board \u2705 | No |\n| **DOWN** | (9,\u202f7) | Empty, on\u2011board \u2705 | No |\n| LEFT | (8,\u202f8) | My own body \u2013 **dead** \u274c |\n| RIGHT | (10,\u202f8) | Off\u2011board \u2013 **dead** \u274c |\n\nBoth **UP** and **DOWN** keep me alive, but which fuels the aggressive plan?\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Tactical Thoughts**\n\n1. **Apple\u2011rich corridor** \u2013 Moving **DOWN** puts me right on the highway to a stack of apples. Each step I\u2019ll gobble one, extending my lead while the rival scrambles for the sparse centre apples.  \n2. **Maintain the wall** \u2013 My horizontal wall at y\u202f=\u202f8 stays intact; the opponent can\u2019t slip above it without crashing. Dropping down preserves that barrier and still leaves escape routes (left along row\u202f9, down the right edge, or later up again).  \n3. **Opponent\u2019s next move** \u2013 He\u2019ll likely dash **RIGHT** to (6,\u202f4) for the apple there. No head\u2011on risk either way, but heading **DOWN** guarantees I start racking up points **immediately**.  \n4. **Future flexibility** \u2013 After scooping the column apples, I can swing left on row\u202f9, loop back down, or even snake back up the left side if I need to block him later.  \n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011Term Plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f25**: Move **DOWN** to (9,\u202f7).  \n- **Turns\u202f26\u201130**: Continue down the column, devouring each apple.  \n- **If opponent tries to cut up the column**, I\u2019ll be one step ahead and can intercept or force a head\u2011on where I have the higher score (10\u202fvs\u202f9).  \n- **After the column is clear**, swing left on the top row (9,\u202f9 \u2192 8,\u202f9 \u2026) to pick up the apple at (5,\u202f9) and keep the pressure on his low\u2011grounded snake.\n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Bottom line:** The fastest, safest way to dominate the board right now is to start the apple run down column\u202f9.\n\n**Next move:**  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, previous body has (4,4), but wait\u2014after eat at (4,5), new head there, old body shifts, but tail (3,1) stays, so from (4,5), DOWN to (4,4) own body now includes old path, wait NO: let's think\u2014after move to (4,5) eat, body: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,7),...,(3,1), tail (3,1)? Wait no, tail is the last, but length +, so tail position remains occupied by body. From (4,5), UP (4,6) own body (next seg), DOWN (4,4) own body (list has (4,4)), LEFT (3,5) no, RIGHT (5,5) no enemy (5,5: board x=5 y=5 . empty).

DOWN into (4,4)\u2014is (4,4) in body after? New body: the deque: old deque head popped (tail), old head is now (3,6)? Wait, standard: if eat, don't pop tail. So body starts from new_head, then old_body[0] to old_body[end], tail still old_tail + new seg at tail pos? No. Actually, for occupation, the body positions are all old body positions plus new head pos, since tail didn't remove. So (4,4) was in old body, still occupied. Yes, DOWN dead.
