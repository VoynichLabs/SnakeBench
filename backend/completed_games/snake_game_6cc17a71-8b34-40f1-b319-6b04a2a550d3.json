Let's break this down!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\n- I'm at (1,4) with 0 apples\n- Snake #1 is at (6,0) with 0 apples\n- Board is 10x10 with apples scattered everywhere\n- We need to box him in and force a crash!\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\nMy current position (1,4) is in the lower middle-left. The enemy is at (6,0) near the bottom right. I need to be AGGRESSIVE but smart.\n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE:**\n- **UP** to (1,5): SAFE! No walls, no bodies. This moves me toward apples at (1,7), (2,5), (3,5), (5,5) - nice central positioning.\n- **DOWN** to (1,3): SAFE! But moves me away from most apples and closer to the bottom edge.\n- **LEFT** to (0,4): SAFE! But hits left wall, limits future mobility. Bad idea when I need to be aggressive.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,4): SAFE! Moves me toward the action and apples at (2,5), (3,5), (2,7), etc.\n\n**STRATEGY PLAN:**\nThe enemy is at (6,0) - he's currently trapped near the bottom right corner. I want to move toward the CENTER to control the board and cut off his escape routes. Going RIGHT (2,4) gives me immediate access to multiple apples and keeps my options wide open. UP (1,5) is also good but slightly more restrictive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (for future self):** \nI need to dominate the central area and create a \"wall\" between the enemy and the apples. Once I have a size advantage, I can start boxing him in. Focus on building length first, then use my body as a barrier.\n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLet's close this gap and start building our empire! CHAT, WE GOING UP!\n\nRIGHT",

Eating gives us +1 point and adds a segment, which is exactly how we start to dominate the board.  \n- \u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,0) \u2013 empty, safe, but no immediate reward.  \n\n**Opponent\u2019s possible moves:** (1,4) can only reach (1,3), (1,5), (0,4) or (2,4). None line up with any of our candidate squares, so no head\u2011on danger this turn.  \n\n**Strategic vibe:**  \n- Grab that apple now \ud83c\udfaf \u2013 points are the fuel for the chase.  \n- After eating, we\u2019ll be a 2\u2011segment snake at (5,0) head / (6,0) tail, still with multiple safe exits (up to (5,1) or left to (4,0)).  \n- Staying length\u20111 would keep us flexible, but an early apple boosts our lead and forces the opponent to scramble for the same tasty spots later.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Take the apple, grow a bit, and keep our options open.

We need to close the gap and start dominating.  \n\n**CURRENT ANALYSIS:**  \n- **My Position:** (2,4) - I'm in the lower center, surrounded by apples at (2,5), (3,5), (2,7), (3,5), (5,5), etc.  \n- **Enemy Position:** (5,0) - He's still low and near the edge, but with one apple he's growing. I need to move FAST to match his growth.  \n- **Threat Check:** No immediate threats. My body is empty, so no self-collision. Enemy is far away.  \n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE:**  \n- **UP to (2,5):** SAFE. This is an apple spot! (2,5) has an apple. Eating it gives me +1 length and points. Also opens up paths to (2,6), (3,5), (1,5).  \n- **DOWN to (2,3):** SAFE, but moves away from apples and deeper into low-y territory. Not aggressive.  \n- **LEFT to (1,4):** SAFE, but retraces my previous position from turn 0. Limits new territory and moves away from apples.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,4):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (3,5) and (4,5), but (3,4) itself has no apple. Less immediate reward.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nThe move UP to (2,5) is a no-brainer\u2014it's an apple! Eating now gives me points and length, which I need to catch up to the enemy. Once I eat, I'll have size 2 and can start planning to box him in. From (2,5), I'll have more options to move toward the center and cut off his escape routes.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nGrow quickly by grabbing nearby apples. Then, use my length to create a barrier between the enemy and the central apples. Force him into the edges where he'll have fewer moves. If I get a lead, I can even set up a head-on collision to finish him.  \n\n**MY MOVE:** UP! Let's eat and climb the scoreboard! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nUP",

They're moving toward the bottom-right area, likely chasing apples like (5,5), (4,7), (7,7).  \n- **Threat Check:**  \n  - Immediate self-collision risk: DOWN to (2,4) is forbidden (backwards into my own body).  \n  - Enemy is far (distance ~3-4 cells), but they might move UP/RIGHT toward central apples. No direct collision yet.  \n  - Board is mostly open; I have multiple safe exits.  \n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE:**  \n- **UP to (2,6):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (2,7) and opens paths to (3,6), (1,6).

(3,5) has an apple. Eating gives +1 point and size growth. Also leads to (4,5), (3,6), (2,5) [but that\u2019s my tail next turn].  \n- **DOWN to (2,4):** DEADLY (backwards into own body). Eliminated.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nRIGHT to (3,5) is the aggressive play\u2014grab another apple immediately to close the score gap (2 vs 2 or 2 vs 3?).

Scoreboard shows we now have 2 apples, but the enemy still leads with 3. They're at (6,1) and could be heading our way. Let's analyze!\n\n**CURRENT ANALYSIS:**  \n- **My Position:** (3,5) - Center-left, body at [(2,5), (2,4)]. I just grew, so my tail at (2,4) will move forward next turn.  \n- **Enemy Position:** (6,1) with body [(5,1), (5,0), (6,0)]. They're low and right, possibly moving up toward central apples like (5,5), (4,7), or (7,7).  \n- **Threat Check:**  \n  - Self-collision: Moving DOWN to (3,4) is SAFE (tail moves forward, freeing (2,4)).  \n  - Enemy: Distance is about 4-5 cells. They could move UP to (6,2) or LEFT to (5,1) [but that's their own body? Wait, (5,1) is their body, so they can't go left]. Actually, their head is (6,1), so UP to (6,2), RIGHT to (7,1), DOWN to (6,0) [but (6,0) is their own body], LEFT to (5,1) [body]. So they're limited: likely UP or RIGHT.  \n  - Board: Open around me. Apples at (4,2), (4,7), (5,5), (7,7), etc.  \n- **Score Gap:** We're down by 1. Need to close it fast to force a head-on collision later.  \n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE (SAFE):**  \n- **UP to (3,6):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (4,7), (5,9), (7,7). Opens paths to (3,7), (2,6), (4,6). Good for dominating center.  \n- **DOWN to (3,4):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (4,2), (3,9) is far. But down could lead to bottom, where enemy is. Risky if enemy moves UP.  \n- **LEFT to (2,5):** DEADLY (backwards into own body at (2,5)). Eliminated.  \n- **RIGHT to (4,5):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (5,5), (4,7). Central position. But (4,5) is empty? Board shows (5,5) is an apple, (4,5) is not listed.  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nUP to (3,6) is best\u2014aggressive toward central cluster. It keeps multiple options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn) and positions me to intercept enemy if they chase (5,5) or (4,7). We need to grow faster and cut off their paths. From (3,6), I can threaten (4,7) apple and block their route upward.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nChain apples to tie or lead score. Use center control to force enemy into edges or into a head-on collision. Watch their moves\u2014if they go UP, I can mirror or flank. Avoid corners; stay mobile.  \n\n**MY MOVE:** UP!

Tail at (2,5) moves forward, freeing it.  \n- **Enemy Position:** (7,1), Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,0)], Apples: 3. They're on the right edge, possibly chasing apples like (7,7) or (7,2).  \n- **Threat Check:**  \n  - Self-collision: Moving DOWN to (3,5) is BACKWARDS into my own body\u2014DEADLY! Eliminate. Moving LEFT to (2,6) is SAFE (empty), RIGHT to (4,6) SAFE, UP to (3,7) SAFE.  \n  - Enemy: Distance ~6-7 cells. They might move LEFT to (6,1) [their own body, so not possible? Wait, (6,1) is their body, but they can move into empty cells only. Likely UP to (7,2) (apple there!), RIGHT to (8,1), or LEFT to (6,1) but blocked by body. They could chase (7,2) or central apples.  \n  - Board: (3,7) is empty? From board state: (3,7) not listed, so SAFE. (2,6) empty, (4,6) empty.  \n- **Score Gap:** Down by 1\u2014need to eat an apple soon! (3,7) is near, but no apple listed. Apples at (4,2), (5,5), (7,7), (3,9) far.  \n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE (SAFE):**  \n- **UP to (3,7):** SAFE. Keeps me center, path to (3,9) apple. But (3,7) has no apple\u2014grows options for next moves (UP to (3,8), LEFT to (2,7) or RIGHT to (4,7) which has an apple!).  \n- **LEFT to (2,6):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (1,7) and (0,1), but left edge might trap me. Reduces future options (corner risk).  \n- **RIGHT to (4,6):** SAFE. Moves toward apples at (4,7), (5,5), (4,2). More aggressive toward enemy's potential route.  \n- **DOWN to (3,5):** DEADLY\u2014into own body (3,5). NO!  \n\n**STRATEGY:**  \nRIGHT to (4,6) is best\u2014dominant! It positions me to grab (4,7) apple next turn (if enemy doesn't take it first) and blocks enemy's upward path from (7,1). From (4,6), I can chase (5,5) or flank. We need to close the score gap fast and force enemy into mistakes.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nChain central apples (4,7)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(7,7) to tie or lead. Monitor enemy\u2014if they go UP, I mirror to intercept. Avoid edges; use center control for head-on collision later when I lead.

Let's break it down!\n\n**CURRENT ANALYSIS:**\n- **My Position:** (4,6), Body: [(3,6), (3,5)]. Tail at (3,5) moves forward, freeing it. I'm centered, ready to pounce.\n- **Enemy Position:** (7,2), Body: [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,0)]. They have 4 apples, but they're stuck near the bottom-right corner. Apples nearby? (7,2) might be an apple drop? Wait, board shows an apple at (7,2)? Let's check: Board state row 2 (y=2) has \". . . . A . . 1 . A\" \u2013 that's (4,2) apple? Actually (7,2) is where they are, but there's an apple at (9,2). No apple at (7,2) listed in apple drops. Apple drops: (7,2) not there. So they're not eating next turn unless they move to one. Their options: they could go UP to (7,3) (empty?), LEFT to (6,2) (empty?), RIGHT to (8,2) (empty?), or DOWN to (7,1) but that's their own body\u2014DEADLY! Wait, (7,1) is their body, so they can't go DOWN. Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. They might chase (9,2) apple or (7,7) but that's far.\n- **Threat Check:**\n  - Self-collision: Moving LEFT to (3,6) is into my own body\u2014DEADLY! Moving DOWN to (4,5) is SAFE (empty, apple at (5,5) nearby). Moving UP to (4,7) is SAFE (apple there! From drops: (4,7) is an apple). Moving RIGHT to (5,6) is SAFE (empty).\n  - Enemy: Their head at (7,2). They can't crash into us this turn (distance 3 cells away). But if they move UP to (7,3) or RIGHT to (8,2), no direct collision. However, if they go LEFT to (6,2), still safe. But watch for future traps.\n  - Board: Center is open. My body is at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\u2014all safe. Apples at (4,7) right above me! That's juicy. (5,5) is diagonal down-right. (7,7) is a bit farther but central.\n- **Score Gap:** Down by 2\u2014need to eat NOW! (4,7) apple is directly UP. If I eat it, I grow to 3 apples, closing the gap. But check if enemy could intercept? They're far away. They might go for their own apples, but I need to prioritize.\n\n**MOVES AVAILABLE (SAFE):**\n- **UP to (4,7):** SAFE and has an apple! I grow to 3 apples, score +1. From there, options: UP to (4,8) (empty?), LEFT to (3,7) (empty), RIGHT to (5,7) (empty? (5,7) not listed, probably empty). Great for keeping options open and dominating center.\n- **DOWN to (4,5):** SAFE. Moves toward apple at (5,5) and (4,2). But it's away from the immediate apple above, and might let enemy get ahead if they eat first.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6):** SAFE. Moves toward (5,5) apple and central control. But (4,7) apple is closer and easier to grab first. If I go RIGHT, enemy might snatch (4,7) later? No, it's mine!\n- **LEFT to (3,6):** DEADLY\u2014into my own body. NO! Blocked.\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nUP to (4,7) is the play\u2014grab that apple instantly! It grows my score to 3, keeps me central, and sets up to chase (3,9) or (5,5) next. We're boxing the enemy in by controlling the middle; they're cornered on the right edge. From (4,7), I can move to block their upward path or flank them if they come up. Be aggressive\u2014force them into mistakes.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (4,7) now \u2192 from there, chase (5,5) or (3,9) to tie or lead. Monitor enemy: if they go UP, cut them off in center. Aim for head-on collision when I have score advantage. Avoid edges; center control wins games. Stay hungry, chat!\n\n**MY MOVE:** UP! Let's feast! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80  \nUP",

          "rationale": "**YO CHAT! Turn 6 and we're on the move!** Let's break down the board\u2014enemy snake #1 is at (7,3) with 4 apples, and we're at (4,7) with 3 apples. We ate that apple last turn, so we're back in action, but we're still down. Time to dominate the center and force them into a corner. They're chilling on the right side; we can control the middle and cut them off. Let's analyze every move!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- **My head:** (4,7)\n- **My body:** [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] \u2014 tail at (3,5) will move forward next turn, freeing it up.\n- **Enemy head:** (7,3)\n- **Enemy body:** [(7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)] \u2014 they're stretched out vertical on the right edge.\n- **Apples:** (4,7) is gone (we ate it), but there are apples at (3,9) top-left, (5,9) top-right, (5,5) center, (9,6) far right, etc. We'll ignore apple-hunting for now\u2014focus on boxing them in!\n- **Score:** 3 vs 4. We're close! If we eat next, we tie. But if they crash into us, we win instantly. Be aggressive.\n\n**THREAT CHECK:**\n- Enemy head at (7,3) is 3 cells away horizontally and 4 vertically\u2014no direct collision this turn unless they move toward us (e.g., LEFT to (6,3)). But they're probably eyeing apples like (9,6) or (7,7).\n- If they move UP to (7,4) (apple drop there!) or LEFT to (6,3), they're not hitting us. However, we need to watch for future traps\u2014if we box them near the wall, they might suicide.\n- Two-head collision: Only if we both move to the same cell. Unlikely this turn (distance >1), but if we move RIGHT to (5,7) and they move LEFT to (6,3), no clash. Stay sharp!\n- Self-collision: Our body is behind and left\u2014we're safe as long as we don't reverse into (4,6) (the cell behind us). That would be DEATH.\n\n**EVALUATING ALL MOVES (ELIMINATE KILLERS FIRST):**\n\n1. **LEFT to (3,7):**\n   - SAFE? Yes! (3,7) is empty (check board: row 7 has \". A A . 0 . . A . .\" so positions around: (2,7) apple, (3,7) empty). No body, no enemy.\n   - KILLERS? Not into our body (our body is at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\u2014(3,7) is above (3,6), so safe). Not out of bounds. Not into enemy (enemy far right).\n   - FUTURE OPTIONS? From (3,7): UP to (3,8) (empty? probably, apple at (3,9) above), DOWN to (3,6) (our own body\u2014DEADLY next turn if we go there), LEFT to (2,7) (apple there! from drops: (2,7) is an apple drop), RIGHT to (4,7) (empty now). Good options: 3 safe paths (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Moves us toward left side apples and potential center control. But DOWN is a trap\u2014leads into our own body after tail moves? Wait, tail moves forward, so (3,6) might free up? Actually, after this move, our body becomes [(3,7), (4,6), (3,6)] with tail at (3,5). Next turn, (3,5) moves to (3,6)? No, tail moves forward along the path, so (3,5) goes to (3,6), but (3,6) is currently occupied? Need to simulate: After LEFT, new body: head (3,7), old head (4,7) becomes body, old body (4,6) becomes next, old body (3,6) becomes tail? Wait, snake list is head-to-tail: new head (3,7) connects to old head (4,7), then (4,6), then (3,6), and tail was (3,5) but it drops off. So new tail is (3,6)? Actually, when we grow, we add a segment. We didn't eat an apple here ( (3,7) no apple), so no growth. Tail moves forward: (3,5) is dropped, new body: (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (3,6). So (3,6) is occupied. From (3,7) next, DOWN to (3,6) is into our own body\u2014DEADLY. UP to (3,8) empty, LEFT to (2,7) apple, RIGHT to (4,7) empty. So 2 safe options next? Wait, that's only 2 (UP and LEFT are safe, RIGHT is safe but BACKWARDS? RIGHT from (3,7) is to (4,7), which was previous head\u2014 that's not backwards into body; it's into the old head position, which is now body. From (3,7), moving RIGHT to (4,7) would be into the cell occupied by the second segment of our body (old head). Is that allowed? No! Rule: \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" (4,7) is now part of our body (the neck). So moving RIGHT would crash into our own neck\u2014DEADLY. So actually only UP and LEFT are safe from (3,7). LEFT to (2,7) is apple! That could be good for growth, but we're focusing on enemy. Still, it's a strong move toward left side apples.\n   - SCORE IMPACT: No apple here. Stays 3.\n   - STRATEGY: Moves us left, away from enemy, but boxes them in from the flank? They're on right, so we can cut them off later. But we want aggression\u2014maybe not ideal.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (5,7):**\n   - SAFE? Yes! (5,7) is empty (board row 7: (5,7) is after \".0.\" so empty). No bodies, no enemy.\n   - KILLERS? Not into our body ( (5,7) not occupied). Not out of bounds. Not into enemy.\n   - FUTURE OPTIONS? From (5,7): UP to (5,8) (empty), DOWN to (5,6) (empty), LEFT to (4,7) (empty, our old spot), RIGHT to (6,7) (empty? probably). All 4 directions safe? Check: (5,6) empty, (6,7) empty. No immediate traps. Good central control.\n   - SCORE IMPACT: No apple ( (5,7) no drop).\n   - STRATEGY: Keeps us central, closer to (5,5) apple (diagonal down-left) and (5,9) top-right. Positions us to challenge enemy's right side\u2014 if they go UP, we can move to (5,8) or (6,7) to block. Aggressive move! We're at (5,7), enemy at (7,3)\u2014distance decreasing, possible future head-on if we push right. But we have lower score? Wait, we're 3 vs 4, so if we force collision, we lose? No, head-on collision: both die, and if all die, higher apples win. They have 4, we have 3\u2014we'd lose. So avoid head-on until we eat and tie or lead. Still, from (5,7), we can pivot to eat (5,5) or block.\n\n3. **UP to (4,8):**\n   - SAFE? Yes! (4,8) is empty (row 8: \". . . . . . . . . A\" so (4,8) empty). No bodies, no enemy.\n   - KILLERS? Not into our body ( (4,8) not occupied). Not out of bounds. Not into enemy (far).\n   - FUTURE OPTIONS? From (4,8): UP to (4,9) (empty? row 9: (4,9) empty, apple at (3,9) and (5,9) nearby), DOWN to (4,7) (empty, our old spot), LEFT to (3,8) (empty), RIGHT to (5,8) (empty). All 4 safe! Wide open space. (4,9) might lead to (3,9) apple next.\n   - SCORE IMPACT: No apple ( (4,8) no drop).\n   - STRATEGY: We're already high on the board, going higher boxes us toward top edge but also toward top apples like (3,9) and (5,9). Enemy is low at (7,3), so we can dominate upper half and force them to stay low. If they climb up, we cut them off. Be aggressive by controlling vertical space\u2014 they might be forced into walls. But we're not eating, just positioning.\n\n4. **DOWN to (4,6):**\n   - SAFE? NO! DEADLY\u2014(4,6) is our own body (second segment from head). This is moving back into our neck\u2014straight suicide. Rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\" From (4,7), DOWN is back to (4,6), which is occupied by our body. INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATE.\n   - (Also, even if it were empty, it's backwards relative to our previous UP move, but the rule is clear: into own body = dead.)\n\n**ELIMINATED:** DOWN is out (self-collision). LEFT, RIGHT, UP are all safe with multiple follow-up options.\n\n**AMONG SAFE MOVES:**\n- We need to be AGGRESSIVE and box the enemy in. They're on the right edge at (7,3), body going down. We're at (4,7) in the center. To trap them, we should move RIGHT to (5,7)\u2014it pushes us closer to their territory, threatening to cut off their upward escape. From there, if they go LEFT to (6,3), we can move to (6,7) or (5,6) to block. LEFT to (3,7) pulls us left, away\u2014 too defensive; they have room to grow. UP to (4,8) is neutral, but doesn't pressure them as much. RIGHT keeps us central-aggressive, opens paths to chase apples like (5,5) or (9,6) later, and positions for potential head-on if we eat first and lead (let's eat next\u2014 from (5,7) we can go DOWN to (5,6) toward (5,5) apple).\n- Long-term plan: Move RIGHT to (5,7) \u2192 next, DOWN to (5,6) to eat (5,5) apple (score tie 4-4) \u2192 then push right to flank enemy. Monitor their move: if they go UP to (7,4) (apple there), we climb up to (5,8) and block their path. Force them into the wall\u2014 crash or starve. We win by outmaneuvering, not just eating.\n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT! Let's close the gap and hunt! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25  \nRIGHT",

We're at 3 apples, they're at 5\u2014time to close the gap or force a crash! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**THREAT CHECK:**  \nEnemy head (7,4) is 2 cells RIGHT of us ( (5,7) to (7,4) is diagonal\u2014distance 2+3=5, but if they move LEFT to (6,4) or UP to (7,5), they're not hitting us.

RIGHT keeps us on their tail (pun intended), forces them into walls. Plus, from (6,7) we can pivot to eat (7,7) apple later if safe.

Out of bounds? All moves inside board.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES:**  \n1. **LEFT to (5,7):** NO! DEADLY\u2014 (5,7) is our own body (old head, now segment after last move). Instant suicide. ELIMINATE!  \n2. **RIGHT to (7,7):** SAFE! (7,7) has an apple\u2014we'd eat it, grow to 4 apples (tie 4-5!), and body shifts to [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6)]. Future: From (7,7), LEFT back to (6,7) (into body? Neck hit\u2014deadly), but UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), RIGHT (8,7) open. Aggressive\u2014steals top apple, blocks enemy path to upper right.

Missed chance to grab apple now.\n\n**STRATEGY BREAKDOWN:**  \nWe need apples fast to catch up\u2014 RIGHT to (7,7) grabs one NOW, ties score 4-5! Box them in by dominating the right side: From (7,7), we flank their vertical line (x=7), forcing them left into walls or into us. UP to (6,8) is safe but passive\u2014no growth, lets them expand. DOWN to (6,6) delays growth. Aggression wins games\u2014RIGHT pressures their territory, opens path to chase (9,6) or (5,9) next. If they move UP aggressively, we can pivot to (7,8) or (8,7). Long-term plan: Eat (7,7) \u2192 cut off their escape \u2192 force head-on if score flips or trap against x=9 wall. Don't get boxed\u2014stay mobile.\n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT! Eat that apple, chat!

Passive UP/DOWN lets them expand; RIGHT is aggressive, cuts their space, and with our higher mobility (we're wider open), we force them to crash into us or the wall. Long-term: Trap snake #1 between our body and x=9\u2014head-on collision if we lead by apples? We're close. Chat, this is LIVE\u2014no hesitation!  \n\n**MY MOVE:** RIGHT!

No immediate body or enemy collision.  \n- **DOWN to (8,6)**: SAFE? (8,6) is empty (row 6 is mostly empty).  \n- **LEFT to (7,7)**: DANGER\u2014 that's my own body segment (old neck after last move). Instant suicide\u2014ELIMINATE!  \n- **RIGHT to (9,7)**: SAFE? (9,7) is empty (row 7: my body ends at (4,7), enemy at (9,5) not blocking). But moving into the wall limits future moves\u2014only UP or DOWN from there, and enemy could flank from (9,6) or (9,5). Risky long-term.  \n\n**EVALUATING SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **UP (8,8)**: SAFE, opens up to (8,9) or (9,9) later. Gets us closer to top-right apples like (9,8) or (5,9). But enemy at (9,5) could move UP to (9,6) or (9,7) and threaten head-on if we chase apples. Passive\u2014lets them expand left into (8,5) or down.  \n2. **DOWN (8,6)**: SAFE, approaches apple at (6,5) or (5,5). From there, LEFT to (7,6) or RIGHT to (9,6) to cut off enemy. More aggressive\u2014flanks enemy's vertical path and keeps options open (can go UP or LEFT next).  \n3. **RIGHT (9,7)**: SAFE but traps us in the corner. If enemy moves UP to (9,6), we could crash next turn if we both go for (9,6) apple. Not ideal\u2014we're already close to their space.  \n\n**STRATEGY BREAKDOWN:**  \nWe need to dominate the right side and trap snake #1 between our body and the wall. DOWN to (8,6) positions us to threaten their vertical line (x=8-x=9), forcing them to move UP or into a dead end. From (8,6), we can chase apple (6,5) to grow, or flank to (9,6) to block their escape. Aggressive play forces them into risky moves\u2014they have 5 apples, we're close at 4. If they move UP to (9,6), we could go LEFT to (7,6) next and set up a head-on if we lead. No growth this turn, but setup is key\u2014long-term, we box them against the top wall.

None of those land on (9,6) or (8,5), so whichever we pick we avoid an immediate head\u2011on KO.\n- **Why UP wins the vote:**  \n  1. **Immediate apple** at (9,6) boosts our lead to 6\u20114.  \n  2. Growing puts a block of extra body at the far right, giving us a **vertical corridor** (9,7 \u2192 9,8 \u2192 9,9) to keep escaping or to force the enemy into a cramped mid\u2011board zone.  \n  3. After the move we still have two safe continuations (UP or LEFT), so we\u2019re not boxed in.  \n  4. Left would sacrifice an easy point and push us into the centre where the opponent already dominates the 7\u2011row line.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**  \n1. **Turn\u202f11:** Grab the apple at (9,6) (our current move).  \n2. **Turn\u202f12\u201113:** Keep climbing up the right wall toward the apple at (9,8) while the opponent is forced to wander left or down.  \n3. **Turn\u202f14+**: Swing left\u2011ward on the top row, cutting off the opponent\u2019s retreat and setting up a possible head\u2011on when we still have the higher score.\n\nLet\u2019s punch that apple and tighten the noose! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nUP",

ELIMINATE!  \n\n**EVALUATING SAFE MOVES:**  \n1. **LEFT to (5,5)**: SAFE, HIGH REWARD! Grab apple, grow to 6 apples (score 6-7). From (5,5), we can flank enemy\u2019s left\u2014cutting off their escape against the wall.  \n2. **UP to (6,6)**: SAFE, but LESS rewarding. No apple there.

Time to plot our next move and crush them! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **My head at (5,5)**, body: [(6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7)]\n- **Enemy head at (7,8)**, body: [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4)]\n- **Apple positions:** Plenty scattered, but we're ignoring apples unless they align with our aggressive path. Focus on enemy!\n- **Key threats:** Enemy is pinned against the right wall (x=8-9). Their head at (7,8) \u2013 they might move LEFT, DOWN, or UP. If they move LEFT to (6,8), they could escape. If DOWN to (7,7), they might crash into my body at (7,7)! That's a potential win if I play right. If UP to (7,9), they're trapped by the wall.\n\n**EVALUATING MY MOVES from (5,5):**\n1. **UP to (5,6):** Check if safe. Board shows row 6: at (6,6) is empty, (7,6) is my body. (5,6) is not occupied by any snake body (enemy bodies at x=8-9). So SAFE. No apple there, but it positions me to block enemy if they try to move LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8) \u2013 I could then move RIGHT next turn to threaten collision. Good for cutting off escape. Future options: can go UP again, LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6) (but (6,6) is near my body at (7,6) and (8,6), might get tight).\n2. **DOWN to (5,4):** Check board. Row 4 has enemy body at (7,4) and (8,4), but (5,4) is empty (apple at (4,2) and (4,0) elsewhere). SAFE. But it's exposed \u2013 enemy could move DOWN from (7,8) to (7,7), which is my body, so they might die. But moving DOWN here doesn't help me pressure that. I'd be farther from blocking their escape. Not ideal.\n3. **LEFT to (4,5):** Check board. Row 5: (4,5) is empty (my body at (6,5), (7,5); enemy none there). SAFE. But this moves away from the enemy's flank. From (4,5), I can chase apples like (4,2) or (4,9), but I'm focusing on the enemy. Also, it opens up more board space, but I want to squeeze them against the wall. Less aggressive.\n4. **RIGHT to (6,5):** DANGER! That's my own body segment (the one right behind my head from last move). Moving backwards into myself = death. ELIMINATE IMMEDIATELY! No suicide.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION PLAN:**\nChat, we need to box them in! Enemy is vulnerable at (7,8) \u2013 if they go DOWN to (7,7), they crash into my tail and die (I win). If they go LEFT to (6,8), they escape but I can pursue. My move UP to (5,6) sets up perfect pressure: from there, I can move RIGHT to (6,6) next turn to block their LEFT escape, or DOWN to (5,5) if they drop. This keeps options wide and keeps me aggressive \u2013 if they move DOWN, I might get a free win without moving into them. Score 6-7, I'm hungry, gotta eat more apples soon but first dominate the board! If they move UP or LEFT, I chase and cut off. Long-term: Force a head-on or trap them against wall/apples. Remember, if they crash into me, I win \u2013 let's make them panic!\n\n**MY MOVE:** UP to (5,6) \u2013 position for the kill! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Empty and not occupied by any snake. \u2705\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Opponent\u2019s simultaneous options  \nFrom (5,\u202f6) the foe can go to:  \n- **UP (5,\u202f7)** \u2013 empty.  \n- **LEFT (4,\u202f6)** \u2013 empty.  \n- **RIGHT (6,\u202f6)** \u2013 empty.  \n\n**None** of those squares are (6,\u202f7), so we **won\u2019t die in a head\u2011on clash** this turn.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 What does moving DOWN give us?  \n- **+1 apple** \u2192 score jumps to **8** (we already lead 7\u20116).  \n- **Growth** \u2013 our tail stays, extending our length and making it *harder* for the opponent to thread through us.  \n- **Positioning** \u2013 we\u2019ll sit right under the cluster of high\u2011value apples at (3\u20115,\u202f9). That corridor will become ours to sweep in the next few moves.  \n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Future flexibility  \nAfter we drop into (6,\u202f7) we\u2019ll have plenty of exits:  \n- Up back to (6,\u202f8) (our old head).  \n- Left to (5,\u202f7) (could pressure the opponent if they move there).  \n- Right to (7,\u202f7) (still open).  \n\nSo we stay **mobile**, not boxed in.\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Risk assessment  \n- No immediate wall contact.  \n- No collision with our own body.  \n- No collision with opponent\u2019s body.  \n- The only possible danger is if the opponent somehow ambushes us next turn, but with our longer body we\u2019ll have the edge to steer them into a corner.\n\n**Conclusion:** Grab the apple, grow, and keep the pressure.

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 16, score 6-7, head at (5,6) after that clutch UP move. Snake #1 is still at (6,8) with 7 apples, but we're closing the gap! Time to keep the pressure on and force them into a mistake. Let's break it down!\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **My head:** (5,6)\n- **My body:** [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7)] \u2014 note (7,6) and (8,6) are on row 6, so my body is blocking potential paths.\n- **Enemy head:** (6,8) \u2014 they moved LEFT from (7,8)? Or maybe down? Actually, looking at the board: row 8 shows \". . . . . . 1 T T T\" which means at column 6 there's '1' (enemy head). So they moved LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8). Their body now extends left: (7,8) becomes part of body, and so on.\n- **Enemy body:** Based on previous, they have [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)] \u2014 wait, the board shows at row 8: col6='1', col7='T', col8='T', col9='T' so actually their body is at (7,8), (8,8), (9,8) and then down to (9,7) etc. So they are still mostly against the right wall, but now head at (6,8) which is one step left from the wall.\n\n**EVALUATING MOVES from (5,6):**\n\n1. **UP to (5,7):** Check safety. Board row 7: \". A A . . . A . T T\" \u2014 at (5,7) is '.' (empty). No snake bodies there. Enemy bodies are at (7,8),(8,8),(9,8) etc., not (5,7). My body at (7,6) and (8,6) are below. So (5,7) is SAFE. Options after: can go UP to (5,8) which might be near enemy? But (5,8) is empty (row 8: at col5 is '.'). Could also go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. This move positions me to potentially block enemy if they go UP or LEFT. But let's see if we can get closer to pressure.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,5):** Check safety. (5,5) is part of my body! Actually, my head is at (5,6), and my body includes (5,5) as the next segment. So moving DOWN would move into my own body segment. That's death! ELIMINATE. (Moving backwards into your own body is not allowed.)\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,6):** Check board. Row 6: \". . . . . 0 . T T T\" \u2014 at col4 is '.' (empty). No snake bodies there. Enemy bodies are all at x=6-9? Actually enemy head at (6,8), body at (7,8),(8,8),(9,8),(9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4). So (4,6) is clear. SAFE. This moves away from enemy but opens up left side. Could chase apples like (4,2) or (4,0). However, enemy is at (6,8) \u2014 if we go LEFT, they might move UP to (6,9) or DOWN to (6,7) or LEFT to (5,8). We lose pressure. Not aggressive enough.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6,6):** Check safety. Row 6: at col6 is currently '.'? Actually board row 6: \". . . . . 0 . T T T\" \u2014 so col6 is '.'? Wait: columns: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'0',6:'.',7:'T',8:'T',9:'T'. So (6,6) is empty. BUT my body at (7,6) is adjacent? Actually (7,6) is part of my body, but (6,6) is not occupied by any snake. However, note: if I move to (6,6), I'm moving into a cell that is not currently occupied, but I need to check if any enemy head might move into (6,6) simultaneously. That's a head-on collision risk. Also, (6,6) is to the right of my head at (5,6), and my body extends to (7,6) etc. So (6,6) is safe from my own body. Is there an enemy body at (6,6)? No. So it's physically safe to move there. However, consider: enemy head at (6,8). If enemy moves DOWN to (6,7), that's not (6,6). If enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), not (6,6). If enemy moves UP to (6,9), not (6,6). If enemy moves RIGHT to (7,8), not (6,6). So likely no direct collision. But also, (6,6) is closer to enemy and could be used to cut off their left escape if they try to go to (5,8) next turn? Actually from (6,8), they could go LEFT to (5,8). If I'm at (6,6), I'm not directly blocking that. However, from (6,6) I could move UP to (6,7) next turn to pressure. Also, note: there's an apple at (6,7)? Actually apple list: (6,7) is an apple! Yes, (6,7) is in the apple list. So if I move to (6,6) now, next turn I could move UP to (6,7) and eat that apple, growing and scoring. That's a good plan! And it puts me right next to enemy's potential path.\n\nWait, check board: row 7 shows at col6: '.'? Actually row 7: \". A A . . . A . T T\" \u2014 so col6 is '.'? Let's map: col0:'.', col1:'A', col2:'A', col3:'.', col4:'.', col5:'.', col6:'A', col7:'.', col8:'T', col9:'T'. So (6,7) is actually an apple! But in the board drawing, it shows \"A\" at (6,7) \u2014 yes! So (6,7) has an apple. That means if I move to (6,6) now, I'm one step away from eating that apple next turn. And that apple is at (6,7), which is directly below enemy head at (6,8)! So if I go to (6,6) now, and enemy moves somewhere, I might be able to grab that apple and grow. But also, if enemy moves DOWN to (6,7) to eat that apple? That would be a head-on collision if I also move to (6,7) next turn? Actually we move simultaneously. So if I move to (6,6) now, and enemy moves DOWN to (6,7) this turn, they would eat the apple and grow. Then next turn, I could move UP to (6,7) but that's now occupied by their body (since they grew, their tail might not have moved yet? Actually when they eat an apple, they grow immediately, so their body length increases by 1 at the end of the turn. So if they move to (6,7) and eat the apple, then (6,7) becomes their head, and their old body segments shift. So (6,7) would be occupied by their head next turn, meaning I cannot move there safely. That would be bad.\n\nAlternatively, if I move to (6,6) and enemy moves elsewhere, then next turn I can move to (6,7) and eat the apple safely. So it's a bit risky: depending on enemy's move, I might lose the apple or gain it. But given the enemy is aggressive (they have 7 apples), they might go for that apple too. However, note: enemy head at (6,8). To eat the apple at (6,7), they need to move DOWN. Is that safe for them? Check if (6,7) is occupied by my body? No, my body is at (5,5),(6,5),(7,5),(7,6),(8,6),(8,7). So (6,7) is empty. So they could move DOWN safely. So if I go to (6,6), they might move DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple, growing to 8 apples, widening their lead. That's bad for us.\n\nSo maybe moving RIGHT to (6,6) is not optimal if it gives them the apple. Let's think differently.\n\nConsider UP to (5,7). From (5,7), I am at same y as enemy head? Enemy at (6,8), so y=8. I'd be at y=7. I could then move RIGHT to (6,7) next turn to eat that apple, unless enemy eats it this turn. But if I move UP to (5,7) now, enemy might still move DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple. So same issue.\n\nMaybe I should move to cut off their escape more directly. Enemy is at (6,8). They have limited moves: UP to (6,9) - wall? Actually y=9 is top row, so (6,9) is within board? Board size 10x10, y from 0 to 9, so (6,9) is valid. But is there an apple? Apple list: (5,9) and (3,9) and (4,9) are apples. (6,9) is not listed as apple, so probably empty. They could go UP to (6,9). They could go DOWN to (6,7) - apple there. They could go LEFT to (5,8) - check if empty: row 8: \". . . . . . 1 T T T\" so col5 is '.' empty. They could go RIGHT to (7,8) - but (7,8) is currently their body? Actually after they moved to (6,8), their old head position (7,8) becomes body, so (7,8) is now occupied by their body. So they cannot move RIGHT into their own body. So that move is death for them. So they likely won't go RIGHT.\n\nThus, their safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. We want to force them into a bad move. If they go DOWN to (6,7), they eat the apple and grow. That's good for them. If they go UP to (6,9), they might be safe but then we can chase. If they go LEFT to (5,8), they escape the wall but might run into us later.\n\nWe need to position ourselves to threaten them. What if we move LEFT to (4,6)? That gives them more room, not good. What if we move UP to (5,7)? That puts us below them, and if they go DOWN, they crash into us? Wait, if I move to (5,7) and they move DOWN to (6,7), they would be at (6,7) and I at (5,7) \u2014 no collision. But if I move to (5,7) and they move DOWN to (6,7), they eat the apple. If I then move RIGHT to (6,7) next turn, I'd collide with their body? Possibly.\n\nActually, consider a more aggressive move: what if I move RIGHT to (6,6) and hope they don't go for the apple? But they probably will, because it's right there and they want to extend their lead.\n\nMaybe I should move to block their LEFT escape. If I move to (5,7), I'm not blocking LEFT. If I move to (5,8) \u2014 but I'm at (5,6), I can't go to (5,8) in one move. So not possible.\n\nWait, what about moving UP to (5,7) and then if they go LEFT to (5,8), I could move UP to (5,8) next turn? That would be a head-on collision if they also stay? Actually if they move LEFT to (5,8) this turn, and I move UP to (5,7) this turn, then next turn I could move UP to (5,8) but they might move away. Not immediate.\n\nAlternatively, consider moving DOWN to (5,5) is death, so not.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT to (4,6)? That might allow me to go for apples on the left, but I'm supposed to focus on enemy.\n\nLet's think about the apple at (6,7) again. It's a valuable apple. If I can get it, I tie the score at 7-7. But if enemy gets it, they go to 8-6. So it's critical. Can I prevent them from getting it? To prevent them from getting it, I would need to move into (6,7) myself this turn. But from (5,6), I cannot reach (6,7) in one move: possible moves are UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5), LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6). So I cannot directly take the apple this turn. So the apple is up for grabs this turn. Enemy can take it by moving DOWN from (6,8) to (6,7). So they will likely do that to extend their lead.\n\nIf they take the apple, they grow, and their body will extend. Their new head at (6,7), and their old body shifts: previously their body included (7,8) as the first segment? Actually after they moved to (6,8) this turn (turn 16), their body is [(7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)]. If they move DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple, they grow, so their body becomes: new head (6,7), old head (6,8) becomes body, and the rest shift, but since they grew, the tail doesn't move? Actually when you eat an apple, you grow by 1, so the tail stays in place for that turn. So their body becomes: [(6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)] \u2014 wait, the old head (6,8) becomes the first body segment, and the rest follow, and since they grew, the last segment (9,4) remains? Actually, the tail doesn't move when you eat an apple, so the body length increases by 1. So the new body is the old body with the old head added to the front, and the tail stays. So yes, their body would be: head (6,7), then (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4). That's 9 segments total? Head + 8 body = 9 length? Actually originally they had 7 apples, so body length = 7 (since apples collected = length-1? Wait, no: each apple increases length by 1. Starting length is 1 (just head). After 7 apples, length = 8 (head + 7 body). So before move, they have 8 segments: head (6,8) and 7 body segments: (7,8),(8,8),(9,8),(9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4). After eating an apple, they grow to 9 segments: head (6,7), then (6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(9,8),(9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4). Yes.\n\nSo if they eat the apple, they become longer and more dangerous.\n\nGiven that, maybe we should move to a position where if they go for the apple, we can set up a trap. For example, if I move to (6,6) now, and they go DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple, then next turn I can move UP to (6,7) but that's their head now, so I'd die. Not good.\n\nIf I move to (5,7) now, and they go DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple, then I'm at (5,7) and they at (6,7). Next turn, I could move RIGHT to (6,7) but again, it's their head. So I'd die.\n\nSo maybe I should avoid letting them have the apple. How can I prevent that? I can't physically block it this turn. So perhaps I should position myself to threaten them after they take it. If they take the apple, their head will be at (6,7). From there, they might move further to escape. Where can they go? From (6,7), they could move UP to (6,8) (but that's now their body? Actually after they eat, (6,8) is their body, so they can't move back into their own body). They could move DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 but (6,6) might be where I am if I move to (6,6) this turn. That would be a head-on collision if I move to (6,6) and they move to (6,6) simultaneously? Wait, they are moving from (6,8) to (6,7) this turn, so next turn they are at (6,7). If I move to (6,6) this turn, I'll be at (6,6) next turn. Then if they move DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) next turn, and I move UP from (6,6) to (6,7) next turn, we would collide head-on? Actually simultaneous movement: if I'm at (6,6) and they are at (6,7), and I move UP to (6,7) and they move DOWN to (6,6), then we swap positions? But according to rules, if two heads move into the same cell, both die. In this case, I move to (6,7) and they move to (6,6), so we are moving into each other's cells. That's not the same cell. So no collision. However, if I move UP to (6,7) and they stay at (6,7) (but they can't stay, they must move), so not.\n\nActually, if I am at (6,6) and they are at (6,7), and I move UP to (6,7) and they move DOWN to (6,6), then I am moving into their current cell (6,7) and they are moving into my current cell (6,6). Since we are moving into each other's cells, but the rules say: \"Two snake heads move into the SAME cell on the same turn? BOTH snakes die.\" That's only if they target the same cell. Here, we are targeting different cells. So what happens? Actually, the rules don't explicitly say what happens if heads swap places. But in standard Snake games, if two heads swap, they both survive because they don't occupy the same cell simultaneously. However, we need to check the given rules: \"Another snake's head moves into YOUR body? THEY die.\" That's about moving into a body, not about swapping heads. For swapping heads, since each head moves into a cell that was empty (because the other head vacated it), it should be allowed. So swapping heads is safe.\n\nThus, if I go to (6,6) and they go to (6,7), and then next turn I go UP to (6,7) and they go DOWN to (6,6), we swap and both survive. But that doesn't help me win.\n\nI need to force a crash. Maybe I should move to a position where if they take the apple, they become trapped and I can crash into them or force them into a wall.\n\nLet's look at the board layout. After they eat the apple at (6,7), their head at (6,7). Their body extends to the right and up: (6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(9,8),(9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4). They are against the right wall. From (6,7), their possible moves: UP to (6,8) \u2014 but (6,8) is their body (the segment behind their head), so moving UP would be moving into their own body, which is death. So they cannot move UP. DOWN to (6,6) \u2014 could be safe if (6,6) is empty. LEFT to (5,7) \u2014 could be safe. RIGHT to (7,7) \u2014 is (7,7) empty? Board row 7: col7 is '.' (empty). But is (7,7) occupied by my body? My body includes (7,6) and (8,6) and (8,7). (7,7) is empty. So RIGHT is possible. However, if they go RIGHT to (7,7), they are moving away from the wall but still have body to their right? Their body at (7,8) is above, so (7,7) is free. So they have options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Not UP.\n\nIf I move to (6,6) now, and they go DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple, then next turn they are at (6,7). From there, if they go DOWN to (6,6), that's where I am, so they would move into my body? Wait, my body is at (6,6) if I'm there, so if they move DOWN into (6,6), they would move into my body, which would kill them! That's a win for me. But only if I am still at (6,6) and they move into it. However, if I move from (6,6) to somewhere else next turn, then (6,6) becomes empty and they wouldn't crash. So to make that work, I need to stay at (6,6) for their next move. But if I stay, I die because I must move each turn? Actually, I must move each turn; I can't stay still. So I cannot remain at (6,6). So that plan fails.\n\nWhat if I move to (5,7) now? Then if they go DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple, they are at (6,7) and I am at (5,7). Next turn, they might move LEFT to (5,7) to try to escape? But (5,7) is occupied by me, so if they move LEFT into (5,7), they would crash into my body (since my head is there? Actually my head is at (5,7), so if they move into (5,7), that's my head, so they would crash into my head? That's a head-on collision? Wait, if two heads move into the same cell, both die. But if they move into my head's cell and I move away, then they move into an empty cell? Actually, simultaneous movement: if I am at (5,7) and they are at (6,7), and I move somewhere else (say, LEFT to (4,7)), and they move LEFT to (5,7), then they are moving into the cell I vacated, so it's empty when they arrive? No, because movement is simultaneous: we both decide moves before seeing the outcome. So if I move from (5,7) to (4,7), and they move from (6,7) to (5,7), then the cell (5,7) is targeted by both? Actually, I am leaving (5,7), they are entering (5,7). Since I am leaving, it should be safe for them to enter, as long as no other snake is entering that cell. But if only they are entering and I am leaving, then they occupy (5,7) after the move. That's allowed. So no crash.\n\nBut if I stay at (5,7) (which I can't, I must move), then they would move into my cell and we'd have a head-on collision? Actually if I stay and they move into my cell, that's two heads in the same cell? But I didn't move, so my head is still there. They move into it, so yes, two heads in same cell -> both die. But I cannot stay; I must move.\n\nSo to force a collision, I need to predict their move and move into the same cell they are moving into. For example, if I think they will move to (5,7) from (6,7), then I could also move to (5,7) from my current position. But I'm not at (6,7); I'm at (5,6) now. To move to (5,7), I would go UP. So if I move UP to (5,7) this turn, and they move DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple, we are not colliding. Then next turn, if they move LEFT to (5,7), and I move somewhere else, no collision. If I move to (5,7) again? I can't stay.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving to a position that cuts off their escape routes more effectively. Let's think about their likely moves. They want to avoid dying. They are at (6,8). If they move DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple, they grow and score. That seems the best for them. So they will likely do that. If I move to (6,6) now, then after they eat the apple, they are at (6,7). From there, they might move LEFT to (5,7) or RIGHT to (7,7) or DOWN to (6,6). If they move DOWN to (6,6), they crash into me (if I am still at (6,6)) \u2014 but I will move away. So if I move to (6,6) this turn, next turn I need to move somewhere safe. I could move UP to (6,7) but that's where they are, so collision? If I move UP to (6,7) and they move DOWN to (6,6), we swap, no collision. If I move LEFT to (5,6), and they move DOWN to (6,6), they move into (6,6) which I just left, so safe for them. If I move RIGHT to (7,6), and they move DOWN to (6,6), no issue.\n\nSo by moving to (6,6), I'm not directly threatening them. But I am positioning myself to potentially move UP to (6,7) if they don't take the apple. But they probably will take it.\n\nWhat if I move UP to (5,7) now? Then from (5,7), I can move RIGHT to (6,7) next turn to try to take the apple, but if they take it this turn, then (6,7) is their head next turn, so moving into it would be suicide. So not good.\n\nMaybe I should move LEFT to (4,6) and ignore the apple, focusing on cutting off their long-term escape. But they are against the wall; if they take the apple, they might move LEFT or RIGHT to get away from the wall. If they move LEFT to (5,8) from (6,8), that's possible. If I'm at (4,6), I'm far away.\n\nGiven the aggression strategy, I think we should move to (6,6) to pressure the apple and potentially force them to not take it? But if I move to (6,6), I'm not blocking the apple. They can still take it. Unless they think that if they take it, I'll be at (6,6) and they might be forced to move into me next turn. But as we saw, they can avoid that by moving LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the board again. There is another apple at (7,7)? Actually row 7 col7 is '.' empty. No apple there. But there is an apple at (8,3)? That's far. Also apple at (9,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nMaybe I should go for a different apple to grow and tie the score. There's an apple at (4,2) \u2014 but that's far. (5,9) is also an apple, but that's up and right. (3,9) apple. (4,9) apple. But these are not near.\n\nThe closest apple to me is (6,7) \u2014 one step away if I go RIGHT to (6,6) now, then UP to (6,7) next. But enemy can take it this turn.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (5,7)? No. (5,6) is where I am, no apple.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving DOWN to (5,5) but that's death.\n\nWhat about moving LEFT to (4,6)? That might allow me to go to (4,2) eventually, but that's 4 steps away.\n\nGiven the time pressure and the need to be aggressive, I think the best move is RIGHT to (6,6). It's safe, it moves me closer to the enemy and the apple, and it keeps options open. Even if enemy takes the apple, I can then adapt. Maybe next turn I can move UP to (6,7) if they don't take it, or if they do, I can move LEFT to (5,6) or something.\n\nBut let's check safety of (6,6) thoroughly. Are there any obstacles? My body: (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7). So (6,6) is not in my body. Enemy bodies: all at x=6-9, y=4-8, but specifically (6,8) is enemy head, but that's not a body yet? Actually, at the start of the turn, enemy head is at (6,8), and their body includes (7,8), etc. So (6,6) is not occupied by enemy body. So it's empty. So moving to (6,6) is safe from collision with stationary bodies. But what about enemy's move? If they move, they might move into (6,6)? From (6,8), they could move DOWN to (6,7) (not (6,6)), or LEFT to (5,8), or UP to (6,9), or RIGHT to (7,8) but that's their body. So they cannot move to (6,6) in one move. So no risk of collision this turn. So (6,6) is safe.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,6), my body will be: new head (6,6), old head (5,6) becomes body, so body: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. That's fine.\n\nNow, long-term plan: If enemy takes the apple at (6,7), they grow to 8-6. Then next turn, I need to decide. I could move UP to (6,7) to challenge them, but that would be moving into their head, causing head-on collision? If I move UP to (6,7) and they move somewhere else, if they move away, then (6,7) is empty? But if they move away, I move into an empty cell. If they stay, they must move, so they can't stay. So if I move to (6,7) and they move to, say, (5,7), then I am at (6,7) and they at (5,7), no collision. But if I move to (6,7) and they move to (6,8) (but (6,8) is their body, so they can't), or to (6,6) (where I was), then we swap. No collision.\n\nTo force a collision, I need to move into the cell they are moving into. So if I predict they will move to (5,7), I could move to (5,7) from (6,6) by going LEFT to (5,6) and then UP? No, one move only.\n\nMaybe I should plan to cut off their escape. From (6,7), if they eat the apple, they might try to move LEFT to (5,7) to get away from the wall. If I am at (6,6), I can move UP to (6,7) if they don't, but if they do move LEFT, then (5,7) is free. I could move from (6,6) to (5,6) (LEFT) and then to (5,7) (UP) next turn, but that's two turns.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe moving to (6,6) is still the best. It's aggressive, it challenges for the apple, and it keeps me in the vicinity.\n\nAlternatively, what about moving UP to (5,7) now? That puts me directly below the apple. If enemy takes the apple, they are at (6,7) and I at (5,7). Then I could move RIGHT to (6,7) next turn, but if they are there, it's a collision? Actually if I move RIGHT to (6,7) and they move somewhere else, no collision. If they move to (6,7) as well (they can't, they are already there), so not. If they move LEFT to (5,7), and I move RIGHT to (6,7), we swap. No collision.\n\nBut if I move UP to (5,7) and they do not take the apple (maybe they go LEFT or UP), then I can move RIGHT to (6,7) next turn and eat the apple myself. That would tie the score. So that might be better! Because if they don't take the apple, I can take it next turn. And if they do take it, I'm still at (5,7) and can chase them.\n\nBut is (5,7) safe? Check: (5,7) is empty. No snakes there. So safe.\n\nNow, if I move UP to (5,7), my body becomes: head (5,7), body: [(5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. That's fine.\n\nWhat about enemy's possible moves from (6,8)? If they move DOWN to (6,7) (apple), LEFT to (5,8), UP to (6,9), RIGHT to (7,8) (their body, death). So they likely won't go RIGHT. So they might go DOWN, LEFT, or UP.\n\nIf they go DOWN, they eat the apple and grow. If they go LEFT to (5,8), that's adjacent to me at (5,7). Then next turn, I could move UP to (5,8) to challenge them? But if I move UP to (5,8) and they move somewhere, could cause collision. For example, if they move DOWN to (5,7), and I move UP to (5,8), we swap. No collision. But if they move DOWN to (5,7) and I also move DOWN to (5,6), no collision. So not immediate.\n\nIf they go UP to (6,9), they are moving away, and I can chase.\n\nSo both moves have merits. But which one gives me more aggressive control?\n\nLet's think about the score. I'm down 6-7. If I can eat an apple soon, I tie. The apple at (6,7) is the closest. If I move to (5,7) now, I'm positioning to possibly take it next turn if they don't. If they do take it, I'm still close and can pursue. If I move to (6,6) now, I'm also close, but if they take the apple, I'm at (6,6) and they at (6,7). Then I could move UP to (6,7) but that's their head, so if they move away, I can take the spot? Actually if they move away from (6,7), then (6,7) becomes empty, and I can move into it. But they might not move away immediately.\n\nActually, after they eat the apple, they are at (6,7). They must move next turn. They cannot stay. So they will leave (6,7). So if I am at (6,6) and they leave (6,7), I can move UP into (6,7) and eat the apple? But the apple was already eaten, so (6,7) is empty (no apple). So I would just move into an empty cell. That doesn't give me an apple. So I would miss the apple opportunity.\n\nWhereas if I am at (5,7) and they take the apple, then next turn they leave (6,7), and I can move RIGHT to (6,7) and it's empty, but no apple. So same issue.\n\nSo the apple will be gone after this turn if enemy takes it. So my only chance to tie is to eat an apple myself soon. There are other apples: (5,9) is at y=9, x=5. From (5,7), I can go UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9) to eat it. That's two moves. Similarly, (4,9) or (3,9). But there's also an apple at (4,2) which is far.\n\nMaybe I should go for (5,9). From (5,7), UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9). That would give me an apple and tie the score. But is (5,8) safe? Check board: row 8, col5 is '.' empty. No snakes there. (5,9) has an apple. So that could be a plan.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,7) now, then next turn I can move UP to (5,8), then UP to (5,9) to eat the apple. But I need to ensure that enemy doesn't interfere. They are at (6,8). If they move to (5,8) this turn, then (5,8) becomes occupied. So if I plan to go to (5,8) next turn, I need to make sure they don't go there this turn. So by moving to (5,7) now, I'm not blocking (5,8). They could move LEFT to (5,8) this turn. If they do, then (5,8) is occupied by their head next turn, so I cannot go there. That would block my path to (5,9). So that's a risk.\n\nIf I move to (6,6) now, I could go for (6,7) but that apple might be gone. Or go for (5,9) from (6,6): would need to go LEFT to (5,6) then UP to (5,7) then UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9) \u2014 that's longer.\n\nSo perhaps moving to (5,7) is better for pursuing the apple at (5,9). But again, enemy might block (5,8).\n\nLet's look at enemy's likely move. They have 7 apples, I have 6. They want to increase their lead. The apple at (6,7) is right there. It's the most immediate apple for them. So they will likely take it. So if I move to (5,7), they will probably take the apple, and then I can pursue. If I move to (6,6), they will take the apple, and I'm at (6,6) which is adjacent.\n\nGiven the aggression, I want to pressure them. Moving to (6,6) puts me right next to them (one cell away). From (6,6), I can move UP to (6,7) if they don't take the apple, but they will. So after they take it, I'm at (6,6) and they at (6,7). Then I can move LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6) or UP to (6,7) (but that's their head). If I move UP to (6,7), and they move somewhere, it's safe if they move away. But if they move DOWN to (6,6), that's where I am, so they would crash into me? Wait, if I move UP to (6,7) and they move DOWN to (6,6), then I am moving into (6,7) and they are moving into (6,6). Since (6,6) is my current cell, but I am leaving it, they are entering it. That's allowed. No crash.\n\nTo force a crash, I need to move into the cell they are moving into. So if I think they will move to (5,7) from (6,7), I could move to (5,7) from (6,6) by going LEFT to (5,6) and then? Can't in one move.\n\nSo perhaps moving to (5,7) gives me a better chance to intercept if they try to go LEFT. If they go LEFT to (5,8) from (6,8), that's this turn. If I move to (5,7) this turn, then if they go LEFT to (5,8), they are at (5,8) and I at (5,7). Then next turn, I could move UP to (5,8) and they might move DOWN to (5,7), swapping. No crash. But if they move DOWN to (5,7) and I move UP to (5,8), again swap.\n\nSo still no forced crash.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different move: LEFT to (4,6). That moves away, but I could then go for the apple at (4,2) or (4,0). But that seems passive.\n\nGiven the instruction to be aggressive and focus on the enemy, I think I should move to (6,6) to stay close and maintain pressure. Also, from (6,6), I have options to move UP (if apple available), LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. It's a central position.\n\nMoreover, the apple at (6,7) is a hot spot. Even if I don't get it, being close allows me to react.\n\nSo I'll choose RIGHT to (6,6).\n\nBut let's double-check safety: Is there any chance that enemy moves into (6,6) this turn? From (6,8), the only move that lands on (6,6) is if they move DOWN twice, which they can't. So no.\n\nAlso, check if any other snake is there? Only one enemy.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan: After moving to (6,6), if enemy takes the apple, they grow to 8-6. I need to chase and eat an apple soon. Possible apple: (5,9) is reachable in two moves: LEFT to (5,6) then UP to (5,7) then UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9)? Actually from (6,6), to get to (5,9), I need to go LEFT to (5,6), then UP to (5,7), then UP to (5,8), then UP to (5,9). That's three moves. But there's also (6,7) if not taken, but it will be taken. Other apples: (7,5) is my body? Actually (7,5) is my body, so no apple. (8,6) is my body. (8,7) is my body. (9,2) is far. (4,2) is far.\n\nMaybe after this turn, I should go for (5,9). But I need to ensure the path is clear. If enemy moves to (5,8) this turn, that blocks. So perhaps I should consider moving to (5,7) instead to secure the path.\n\nLet's reconsider. If I move to (5,7) now, and enemy takes the apple at (6,7), then next turn I can go UP to (5,8) (if clear) then UP to (5,9). But if enemy took the apple, they are at (6,7). They might move LEFT to (5,7) or UP to (6,8) or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's where I am, so they would crash into me? If I am at (5,7) and they move LEFT from (6,7) to (5,7), that's moving into my cell. Since I am there with my head, it's a head-on collision? Actually, if they move into my head's cell and I stay, then both heads in same cell -> both die. But I must move, so I will leave (5,7). If I move from (5,7) to somewhere else, and they move into (5,7), then they are moving into an empty cell (since I left). So no collision.\n\nSo to force a crash, I need to move into the cell they are moving into. So if I predict they will move LEFT to (5,7) from (6,7), then I should stay at (5,7) \u2014 but I can't stay. Or I should move from (5,7) to (5,7) \u2014 impossible. So I can't force it.\n\nThus, maybe it's better to move to (6,6) to keep my options flexible.\n\nI'll go with RIGHT.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nNow, for the rationale, I need to write in a hype style. Also, I need to include a long-term plan note. The instruction says: \"You can also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. Any such plan must appear BEFORE your final move line.\" So I need to include that before the final move word.\n\nSo I'll write a short plan: \"Plan: After moving to (6,6), if enemy takes the apple, chase and go for (5,9) apple via LEFT then UP. Force them into a corner!\" \n\nBut let's see the format: The rationale should be in the style of the previous one: all caps, lots of emojis, thinking out loud.\n\nSo I'll write:\n\nYO CHAT! Turn 16, head at (5,6). Enemy at (6,8) with 7 apples, we at 6. They're eyeing that apple at (6,7)! Gotta pressure them!\n\nEVALUATING MOVES:\n- UP to (5,7): Safe, but gives them the apple? Maybe.\n- DOWN to (5,5): DEATH! Into my own body.\n- LEFT to (4,6): Safe, but too passive, let them escape.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): SAFE! Moves me closer, challenges for the apple, keeps options open.\n\nSTRATEGY: We go RIGHT to (6,6) to cut off their left escape and be ready to snatch the apple if they hesitate. If they take the apple, we chase! Plan: From (6,6), next turn if apple gone, go LEFT to (5,6) then UP to (5,7) then UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9) for that apple. We tie the score and dominate! Let's make them crash!\n\nMY MOVE: RIGHT to (6,6) \u2013 pressure time! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT\n\nBut the last line must be exactly the word, no extra. So I'll put RIGHT on its own line.\n\nIn the rationale, I need to not mention future directions after the final move line. The plan can be before.\n\nSo final response structure:\n- Rationale with plan included.\n- Then the move word.\n\nI'll write accordinglyYO CHAT! Turn 16, head at (5,6). Enemy at (6,8) with 7 apples, we at 6. They're eyeing that apple at (6,7)! Gotta pressure them!\n\nEVALUATING MOVES:\n- UP to (5,7): Safe, but gives them the apple? Maybe.\n- DOWN to (5,5): DEATH! Into my own body.\n- LEFT to (4,6): Safe, but too passive, let them escape.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): SAFE! Moves me closer, challenges for the apple, keeps options open.\n\nSTRATEGY: We go RIGHT to (6,6) to cut off their left escape and be ready to snatch the apple if they hesitate. If they take the apple, we chase! Plan: From (6,6), next turn if apple gone, go LEFT to (5,6) then UP to (5,7) then UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9) for that apple. We tie the score and dominate! Let's make them crash!\n\nMY MOVE: RIGHT to (6,6) \u2013 pressure time! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

Gotta pressure them!\n\nEVALUATING MOVES:\n- UP to (5,7): Safe, but gives them the apple? Maybe.\n- DOWN to (5,5): DEATH! Into my own body.\n- LEFT to (4,6): Safe, but too passive, let them escape.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): SAFE! Moves me closer, challenges for the apple, keeps options open.\n\nSTRATEGY: We go RIGHT to (6,6) to cut off their left escape and be ready to snatch the apple if they hesitate. If they take the apple, we chase! Plan: From (6,6), next turn if apple gone, go LEFT to (5,6) then UP to (5,7) then UP to (5,8) then UP to (5,9) for that apple. We tie the score and dominate! Let's make them crash!\n\nMY MOVE: RIGHT to (6,6) \u2013 pressure time! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",
