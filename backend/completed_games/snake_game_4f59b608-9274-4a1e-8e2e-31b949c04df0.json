It\u2019s safe (no collision, no wall) and sets the stage for a straight\u2011down sprint to the apple at (2,4).  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Keep the horizon open**: After this down move we still have LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN as follow\u2011ups. If they also go down, we\u2019ll stay on the same row and can later *zig\u2011zag* left/right to cut them off when they inevitably turn.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future play**: Expect them to eat (7,7) and maybe (7,6) on the next two turns. By moving down first we\u2019ll be in a **different column** (x=2) and can start hugging the left\u2011hand apples (2,4 \u2192 2,2) before they\u2019ve built a tail that forces them to stay column\u20117 forever.  \n  4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safety first**: No body yet, so any direction works. Down avoids boxing us into corners and keeps a clean path to the lower\u2011y apples that are *closest* to us.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan** (next few turns):  \n\n- **Turn\u202f0**: DOWN to (2,7).  \n- **Turn\u202f1** (if they went DOWN): LEFT to (1,7) \u2013 we start moving sideways while they still line up column\u20117.  \n- **Turn\u202f2**: DOWN again to (1,6) \u2013 now we\u2019re in sync vertically with their column.  \n- **Turn\u202f3**: LEFT to (0,6) \u2013 we\u2019re creeping toward the left\u2011side apples (1,3,\u202f0,0,\u202f0,5).  \n- **Turn\u202f4+**: Eat the apple at (2,4) then slide to (2,3) \u2192 (2,2) for another point. \ud83c\udfaf  \n\nThis trajectory **keeps multiple safe follow\u2011ups**, avoids the immediate apple\u2011grab zone (so we stay alive long enough to out\u2011score them), and leaves us with an open corridor to squeeze them later. \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udca5\n\nLet\u2019s go for it!

That\u2019s a fast\u2011track to out\u2011growing the rival!  \n\n- **Future flexibility:** A LEFT move leaves us with **three safe follow\u2011ups** (UP, DOWN, LEFT) while still keeping our tail at (2,\u202f6). If we eat the apple, our body becomes (1,\u202f6) \u2192 (2,\u202f6), and we still have room to zig\u2011zag left\u2011right\u2011up without boxing ourselves. \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udd04  \n\n- **Enemy position:** Snake #0\u2019s head (8,\u202f7) with body (7,\u202f7) is on the opposite side of the board. Any head\u2011on showdown would require them to swing far left, which they can\u2019t do yet (blocked by their own tail). \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Staying left of center keeps us far from their reachable zones.  \n\n- **Risk\u2011reward:** LEFT gives us **the highest immediate reward** (apple capture in two turns) while maintaining **the widest branching tree** of safe continuations. That\u2019s the sweet spot for a ruthless, content\u2011driven playstyle. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd25  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns** \ud83d\udccb  \n\n- Turn\u202f2: **LEFT** to (1,\u202f6) \u2013 set up the two\u2011turn apple.  \n- Turn\u202f3: **DOWN** to (1,\u202f5) \u2013 snag that juicy \ud83c\udf4e and grow +1 segment.  \n- Turn\u202f4: **LEFT** to (0,\u202f5) \u2013 another apple (0,\u202f5) is right there, keep the chain going.  \n- Afterwards: Stay flexible with **UP**, **RIGHT**, or **LEFT** again to avoid self\u2011collision and keep the board wide.  \n\nLEFT",

This gives instant length and points, widening the lead and granting us a future \u201cbody shield\u201d to force a corner on Snake\u202f#0.  \n\nAlso note that Snake\u202f#0\u2019s head sits at (8,9) with tail at (8,8). Their only safe moves are **LEFT** (7,9) or **RIGHT** (9,9); both keep them far from our side of the board. By expanding now we can later *squeeze* them against the right wall when they try to chase the many apples on their side.  \n\n**UP** vs **RIGHT** vs **DOWN** give us fewer options (right can\u2019t turn back into our tail later, down will strand us against the left edge). **LEFT** opens the *most* maneuver room while also snatching the juicy apple.  \n\n**Final move:** LEFT",
