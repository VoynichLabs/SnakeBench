It not only propels me closer to additional apple opportunities but also secures my path without immediate danger of collision or retracement.\n\n### Suggested Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After executing RIGHT move:\n  - Continue towards apples at (5, 4) and (5, 5) by planning next steps either further RIGHT or possible movement manipulation around these coordinates.\n  - Stay aware of any aggressive moves from the enemy snake, particularly any shifts towards the upper middle regions.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

My tail is currently at (3, 5).\n- The next apple of interest is at (3, 2).\n\n#### Apples in Proximity:\n- Since I just moved down (5, 3), I'm aligned vertically with the apple at (3, 2).\n- Other apples remain at (9, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 9).\n\n#### Threat Assessment:\n- Snake #0 is positioned at (8, 0), moving potentially towards (9, 1).\n- No immediate threat from Snake #0 since its current trajectory and speed are limited to the bottom row.\n- I must ensure I'm not cornered or put in a position without escape routes.\n\n#### Potential Moves:\n\n1. **UP (5, 4):**\n   - Returns to previous position. No direct gain and could lead into body collision risk due to growth.\n\n2. **DOWN (5, 2):**\n   - Moves directly toward the planned goal of (3, 2).\n   - Risks moving into Snake #0's potential path if its goal shifts upwards unexpectedly.\n\n3. **RIGHT (6, 3):**\n   - Keeps options open for maneuvering and dodging obstacles formed by body growth.\n   - Does not advance toward immediate apple targets but does allow for strategic repositioning.\n\n4. **LEFT (4, 3):**\n   - Direct approach towards apple at (3, 2). This is an optimal move because it progresses toward an immediate target while ensuring safety from collision with my body or other obstacles.\n\n#### Strategic Considerations:\n- Prioritizing the closest apple at (3, 2) not only ensures point gain but also maintains growth management.\n- Maintaining clear exits and navigable paths is crucial to avoiding trapping the snake as it grows.\n- Staying mindful of Snake #0's future movement, which might alter apple access.\n\n#### Decision-Making:\n- **LEFT (4, 3)** aligns well since it takes me closer to the apple at (3, 2) while avoiding collision with my body or other threats.\n\n#### Suggested Strategy for Next Turn:\n- After potentially moving to (4, 3), maintain a focus on securing the apple at (3, 2).\n- Stay alert for an opportunity to change direction if Snake #0 alters its course or threatens my trajectory.\n- Be prepared to evaluate the most accessible apple after securing (3, 2), consider transitioning to central positions for potential follow-up moves.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**"

It\u2019s not immediately threatening my path.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves\n\n1. **UP (2, 3):**\n   - This move advances towards the apple at (1, 3). Although it doesn\u2019t get me directly on it, it positions the snake closer without immediate threat of collision.\n\n2. **DOWN (2, 1):**\n   - Moves the snake further away from the apples of interest and does not provide a strategic advantage over the next few turns.\n\n3. **RIGHT (3, 2):**\n   - Moves back into the body, causing a collision. This is not an option.\n\n4. **LEFT (1, 2):**\n   - Brings me closer to the apple at (1, 3). Moving left positions the snake directly on the path to secure the apple on the next move.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- Targeting the apple at (1, 3) is strategically beneficial, as it promises immediate growth. With the enemy snake located far on the opposite side of the board, I have a critical opportunity to gather points without interference.\n- Maintaining a trajectory towards available apples makes efficient use of the playing area while avoiding my own body and other hazards.\n\n### Decided Strategy for Next Move\n- For the next move, I should focus on consuming the apple at (1, 3), assessing the board for enemy positions and remaining apple opportunities as new moves unfold.\n\n**Decided Next Move: LEFT**"

This can be reached by going down along the column.\n- (2, 9) and (3, 6): These are further away and less accessible, but could be future targets depending on my immediate route and safety.\n\n#### Enemy Snake\n- Enemy Snake #0 remains on the other side of the board. The current board configuration does not present any immediate threats from it.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves\n\n1. **UP (1, 4):**\n   - This move would keep me clear of my body and other obstacles. This move would position me away from both my body and any immediate apples.\n  \n2. **DOWN (1, 2):**\n   - This would lead me back onto my own body, resulting in a collision.

No risk of hitting my own body, but might position me towards a strategic move upward in the next turn.\n\n4. **LEFT (0, 3):**\n   - This move will keep me safe and provide better access for strategic moves toward the apple at (0, 0) for future maneuvers. It's a safe approach with more long-term benefits.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\n\nCurrently:\n- **Immediate Goal:** Maintain safety by making a strategic move toward the available apples while keeping my path clear of any obstacles.  \n- **Consideration:** After making a safe move, continue to plan towards accessing other apples, such as (1, 0), while also monitoring the enemy snake's position and potential movements.\n\n### Next Strategy\n- Plan moves to gradually position toward the less accessible apples like (2, 9) and (3, 6) if opportunities arise or according to safety needs.\n\nDecided Next Move: LEFT"

Maintaining safety allows reevaluation of the board on the next turn to assess the best path to the apple closest to (0, 0).\n- Future planning should involve potentially moving through the left edge down towards (0, 0) or scouting a safer path.\n\n### Self-Strategy Reminder for Next Turn\n- Reassess position after moving UP, specifically considering paths down the left side of the board or other available apples while looking for moves that keep me clear of obstacles and my own tail.\n\nDecided Next Move: UP"
