Grow my snake\n  2. Increase my score\n  3. Position me well for future moves\n\nRisk Assessment:\n- No risk of collision with walls\n- No risk of collision with enemy snake\n- No risk of self-collision\n\nPotential Next Turn Strategy:\n- After eating this apple, look for the next closest apple\n- Potential targets include (7, 7), (0, 3), or (4, 0)\n- Continue to monitor enemy snake positions\n- Maintain flexible movement options\n\nThe move UP is clear and beneficial. It provides an immediate reward with the apple and doesn't expose me to any risks.\n\nNext move: UP"
