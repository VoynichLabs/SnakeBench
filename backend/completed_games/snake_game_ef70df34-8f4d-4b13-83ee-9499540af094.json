Although eating will temporarily reduce immediate follow-ups (after eating, UP would be into my own body, leaving mostly LEFT as the safe follow-up), the score advantage and uncontested apple outweigh the modest reduction in flexibility.\n- UP is slightly safer for long-term mobility, but it forgoes an easy apple and the opponent cannot reach (9,0) in time.\n\nShort plan after this move:\n- Eat at (9,0) now. Next turn, move LEFT to (8,0) to avoid collision with my own body, then reroute toward remaining apples (likely (0,0) along the bottom row) while avoiding tight turns that trap my tail.

Gets you adjacent to apple at (3,9).\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8): safe. Still two moves from (3,9).\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7): safe, but moves away from the easy top apple.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n\n- **DOWN** delays the free apple at (3,9) with no benefit (no competition).\n- **LEFT** lets you reach (3,9) next turn, but after eating it you\u2019ll be forced to move sideways for at least one step before you can go down, because (3,8) will be directly behind your head.\n- **UP** puts you on (4,9); then moving LEFT to (3,9) gives a shape where from (3,9) you can immediately move **downward** on the following turn (since the segment behind you will be at (4,9)), giving you a clean exit off the top wall toward central apples like (1,6) and (3,3).\n\nSo **UP** both secures the top apple quickly and keeps your vertical escape options more flexible after you grab it.\n\n**Strategy note for future self:**\n- Next turn, strongly consider LEFT to eat (3,9).\n- From (3,9) with the UP-then-LEFT path, you\u2019ll be able to go DOWN to (3,8) soon after, then work diagonally toward (1,6) and (3,3), keeping broad open lanes and avoiding coiling too tightly in the upper-left.\n\nUP",
