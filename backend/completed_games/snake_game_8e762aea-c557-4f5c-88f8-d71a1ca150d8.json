No apples collected.  \n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (6,0). Body empty. No apples collected.  \n- **Apples:** 15 apples on the board: listed above.  \n- **Board State:**  \n  - Top row (y=9): . 0 . A A . . . . . (Head at (1,9) with apple at (3,9) and (4,9) nearby)  \n  - Row 8: . . . . . A . . . . (apple at (5,8))  \n  - Row 7: A . . . . . . . . A (apples at (0,7) and (9,7))  \n  - Row 6: . . . A . . A . . . (apples at (3,6) and (6,6))  \n  - Row 5: . A A . . . . . . . (apples at (1,5) and (2,5))  \n  - Row 4: . . . . A . A . . . (apples at (4,4) and (6,4))  \n  - Row 3: . . . A . A . A . . (apples at (3,3), (5,3), (7,3))  \n  - Row 2: Empty  \n  - Row 1: . A . . . . . . . . (apple at (1,1))  \n  - Row 0: . . . . . . 1 . . . (Enemy head at (6,0), no body)  \n- **Scores:** Both 0.  \n- **Rules Reminder:** Simultaneous moves. Heads cannot move into own body (none here), enemy body (none), or off-board. Moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head on the same turn causes mutual death. After movement, if my head lands on an apple, I grow (body adds one segment behind head).  \n\n**Step 1: Eliminate Immediately Deadly Moves**  \n- **UP (from (1,9)):** (1,10) is off-board (y=10 > 9). **DEAD**.  \n- **DOWN (to (1,8)):** Valid within board (0\u2264x\u22649, 0\u2264y\u22649). No body (empty), no enemy body (empty). But must check enemy head move: Enemy at (6,0) is far; unlikely to move to (1,8) this turn. However, enemy could move UP to (6,1), but (1,8) is safe from direct head collision unless enemy goes wildly off. **LIKELY SAFE**.  \n- **LEFT (to (0,9)):** Valid. No body issues. But check apple: (0,9) is not an apple (board shows '.' at (0,9)). Also, enemy at (6,0) can't reach (0,9) in one move. **SAFE**.  \n- **RIGHT (to (2,9)):** Valid. (2,9) is '.' (no apple, no snake). Enemy cannot reach this turn. **SAFE**.  \n\nNo immediate deaths from DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is dead.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)**  \nI need to maximize safety, apple access, and future options. Current head at (1,9) is near top-left, with apples at (3,9), (4,9) to the right/up (but up is dead), and (5,8) below-right, (0,7) left-down, etc. My body is empty, so no self-trapping yet. Enemy is at bottom-left (6,0), far from me, so low immediate collision risk.  \n\n- **DOWN (to (1,8)):**  \n  - Position: Moves toward the center. (1,8) is '.' empty.  \n  - Apple proximity: (1,8) is 1 unit from apple at (5,8) (right 4 units) and apple at (1,5) (down 3 units). Also near (0,7) (left 1, down 1).  \n  - Future options: From (1,8), I can go DOWN to (1,7) (which has apple at (0,7) adjacent), LEFT to (0,8), or RIGHT to (2,8). Good flexibility.  \n  - Risk: If I go DOWN, I'm moving toward the center where apples are dense (rows 7-3). But must watch enemy: Enemy at (6,0) will likely move toward apples too (e.g., UP to (6,1) or RIGHT to (7,0)). Not close yet.  \n  - Long-term: Grow early to increase length, avoid top edge traps later. (1,9) is a corner-ish spot; DOWN opens up the board.\n\n- **LEFT (to (0,9)):**  \n  - Position: Left edge, top row. (0,9) is '.' but (0,7) has apple below (2 units down).  \n  - Apple proximity: (0,7) is reachable in 2 moves (DOWN x2 or DOWN+RIGHT). But from (0,9), options are limited: only RIGHT to (1,9) (backwards) or DOWN to (0,8). LEFT is off-board. This could trap me if I get stuck in corner.  \n  - Future options: Poor. From (0,9), only DOWN is safe; RIGHT loops back to start. If I go LEFT, I risk getting cornered later (e.g., if enemy cuts off below).  \n  - Risk: Top-left corner is a dead-end. Enemy not a threat now, but later if I grow, turns will be harder. No apple immediate.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (2,9)):**  \n  - Position: Still top row, but more central. (2,9) is '.' (see board: row 9, x=2 is '.').  \n  - Apple proximity: (3,9) and (4,9) are apples directly ahead (RIGHT x1 and x2). Very close! I could eat (3,9) next turn if I move RIGHT again.  \n  - Future options: From (2,9), I can go DOWN to (2,8) (empty), LEFT to (1,9) (backwards but possible), or RIGHT to (3,9) (apple!). Good.  \n  - Risk: Moving to (2,9) puts me on top row again; if I keep going RIGHT, I might hit the right edge (x=9). But apples at (3,9) and (4,9) are immediate gains. However, if I eat apple at (3,9) next turn, I grow (body adds segment at (1,9)? Wait, no: after movement, head at new spot, old head becomes body. But since body was empty, after moving to (2,9), body is now [(1,9)] (old head). Then if I eat (3,9), body grows to [(2,9), (1,9)]. That's short, not trapping.  \n  - Enemy threat: Enemy at (6,0) is far; unlikely to collide this turn.\n\n**Comparison and Strategy:**  \n- DOWN: Safe, opens central board, leads to multiple apples (e.g., (0,7), (1,5), (5,8) nearby). More balanced for long-term growth.  \n- LEFT: Safe but limiting; corners are death traps in Snake (especially with empty body now, but as I grow, turning back is hard). Avoid.  \n- RIGHT: Best for immediate apple grab (next turn). But apple at (3,9) is close; however, if I go RIGHT now, I might get to eat it next turn, but enemy could interfere later. Also, top row is risky if I grow and need to turn; body could block.  \n- Overall: The game just started; prioritize safe expansion and avoiding corners. RIGHT feels tempting for apples, but LEFT/RIGHT keep me on the top edge, which is narrow. DOWN moves me toward the dense apple cluster in the middle (rows 3-7), where I can collect multiple apples without hitting edges. From center, I can reach (1,5), (3,3), (4,4), etc., safely. Enemy is at bottom, so middle is contested? But we're far apart now.  \n\n**Final Choice:** DOWN.  \nIt keeps me alive, avoids edges, and positions me for flexible apple hunting (toward (0,7) or (1,5)). I'll plan to go for (0,7) or center apples next. Enemy will likely move toward its own apples (e.g., UP toward (6,1) or (5,3)), but I can outrun or avoid by staying mobile. Long-term: Grow by collecting central apples, monitor enemy position, and don't get trapped in corners.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**  \nFrom (1,8), assess enemy move. If enemy goes UP, I can go DOWN to (1,7) for apple at (0,7) (adjacent). Prioritize safe apple grabs in rows 7-5 while keeping 2+ escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy likely moving toward apples: e.g., UP to (6,2) (toward (6,4) or (6,6)), RIGHT to (7,1) (toward (7,3) or (9,7)), LEFT to (5,1) (toward (5,3)).  \n- **Game phase:** Turn 1, just started. Need to grow quickly but safely. Avoid corners, but my current spot is not a corner.  \n- **Key consideration:** Since no immediate threats, focus on moves that provide multiple escape routes and access to apples. Also, consider that moving onto an apple grows me, which is beneficial early to increase length (makes turns later more flexible? Actually, longer body can trap you, but early growth is good for points).  \n\n**Evaluate each safe move:**  \n1. **UP to (1,9):**  \n   - Apple? No apple at (1,9) (row 9, x=1 is '.').  \n   - Future options: From (1,9), I can go DOWN (back to (1,8)), LEFT (to (0,9)), or RIGHT (to (2,9)). BUT LEFT (0,9) is top-left corner, limited. UP is off-board (y=10). So only 3 directions, one leads to corner.  \n   - Proximity to apples: (3,9) and (4,9) are 2-3 steps RIGHT. Could eat apple at (3,9) next turn if I go RIGHT twice.  \n   - Risk: Staying on top row may limit future options if I grow (body might block). But empty body, no issue yet.  \n   - **Score: 6/10** \u2013 Decent for apples but restrictive.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1,7):**  \n   - Apple? No apple at (1,7) (row 7, x=1 is '.'). But apple at (0,7) is adjacent LEFT-DOWN. Could go LEFT to (0,7) next turn.  \n   - Future options: From (1,7), I can go UP (back to (1,8)), DOWN (to (1,6)), LEFT (to (0,7)), or RIGHT (to (2,7)). Four directions, all valid (0,7 is apple, 1,6 empty, 2,7 empty). Excellent flexibility.  \n   - Proximity to apples: (0,7) is 1 step away. (1,5) is 2 steps DOWN. (3,6) and (6,6) are farther. Good central cluster.  \n   - **Score: 9/10** \u2013 Best so far. Opens up the board, multiple apple options, no corners.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (0,8):**  \n   - Apple? No apple at (0,8) (row 8, x=0 is '.'). But apple at (0,7) is 1 step DOWN.  \n   - Future options: From (0,8), I can go UP (to (0,9) \u2013 corner), DOWN (to (0,7)), RIGHT (to (1,8)). LEFT is off-board. So only 3 directions, one leads to corner (0,9).  \n   - Proximity to apples: (0,7) is close, but that's it. (1,5) and others are farther.  \n   - Risk: Left edge is restrictive; if I grow, might get stuck.  \n   - **Score: 5/10** \u2013 Not ideal; limits movement.  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (2,8):**  \n   - Apple? No apple at (2,8) (row 8, x=2 is '.').  \n   - Future options: From (2,8), I can go UP (to (2,9)), DOWN (to (2,7)), LEFT (to (1,8)), RIGHT (to (3,8)). Four directions, all valid (2,9 is top row but not corner, 2,7 empty, 1,8 previous, 3,8 empty). Good flexibility.  \n   - Proximity to apples: (3,9) and (4,9) are 1-2 steps UP/RIGHT. (5,8) is 3 steps RIGHT. (3,6) is 2 DOWN.  \n   - **Score: 8/10** \u2013 Very good, similar to DOWN. But staying on row 8 may keep me higher, while apples are scattered.  \n\n**Comparison:**  \n- DOWN and RIGHT both offer excellent flexibility and access to apples. DOWN gets me closer to (0,7) and (1,5) quickly. RIGHT gets me closer to (3,9) and (4,9).  \n- **Strategic choice:** The apple at (0,7) is only 2 steps away from (1,8) via DOWN+LEFT. The apple at (3,9) is 2 steps away via RIGHT+RIGHT. Both are immediate.  \n- **Enemy consideration:** Enemy at (6,1) is far left of center but moving. If I go DOWN, I move toward the center where apples are dense (rows 3-7). If I go RIGHT, I stay on upper rows, which might lead to a race for top apples. However, the top-right has apples (3,9), (4,9), (5,8) \u2013 but so does center.  \n- **Long-term plan:** From (1,8), DOWN to (1,7) seems best because:  \n  - It moves me toward the core apple cluster (e.g., (1,5), (3,3), (4,4)), which are more abundant and less likely to be contested immediately by enemy (who is at bottom-left).  \n  - From (1,7), I have a clear path to (0,7) (apple), then to (1,5) (apple), then to center apples.  \n  - Avoids the top edge, which can become a trap if I grow and need to turn back.  \n  - RIGHT is also good, but staying high might force me to eventually go DOWN anyway, and the top-right apples are fewer.  \n- **Risk assessment:** All moves are safe. No immediate head-on collision risk (enemy far). No body traps.  \n\n**Final Decision:** DOWN.  \nIt maximizes future options and moves toward the densest apple region, giving me a balanced growth path. I'll aim for (0,7) or (1,5) next.  \n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**  \nFrom (1,7), assess enemy move. Likely enemy will go UP to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,1). I'll consider LEFT to (0,7) for apple, or DOWN to (1,6) to stay central. Prioritize apple at (0,7) if safe, then move toward (1,5) or center. Monitor enemy proximity; if they head toward my apple path, pivot.  \n\nDOWN  \n**End of Turn 1 Rationale**",

SAFE.\n\nAll four directions are safe from immediate death (off-board, self-collision, enemy body). No risk of head-on collision with enemy (distance is large).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Safe Moves & Strategy**\n*   **UP (to 1, 8):** Returns to previous position. No apple. Future options: 4 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) all valid (except UP leads to (1,9) which is top edge but not a dead end yet). Low immediate reward. Score: 4/10.\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 6):** No apple. Moves deeper into the board. Future options: 4 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). (1, 5) has an apple 1 step down from here. Access to central apples (1,5), (3,6), (4,4). Good flexibility. Score: 7/10.\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 7):** No apple. Moves right. Future options: 4 directions. Gets closer to (3,6) and (3,9). Good. Score: 6/10.\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 7):** **Contains an apple.** Eating an apple is a primary objective. It grows my snake (length becomes 2), giving me more points and flexibility. Future options: From (0, 7), I can go UP (0, 8), DOWN (0, 6), or RIGHT (1, 7). LEFT is off-board. 3 directions, one leads to corner (0,8) eventually, but currently fine. **Immediate reward + points.** Score: 9/10.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLEFT provides an immediate point and growth, which is crucial early game. The apple at (0, 7) is right next to me. Moving to it clears the apple and expands my body (though body is currently empty, growth is positive).\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nEnemy is at (6, 2). They are likely moving toward center apples (6,4) or (6,6). I am at (1, 7). We are far apart. No immediate conflict over resources. Taking the apple at (0,7) is low risk. If I don't take it, the enemy might eventually head that way, but I am closer.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0,7) immediately. From (0,7), I will likely move DOWN to (0,6) or UP to (0,8) to stay safe, but I will look to move RIGHT back into the board toward the cluster of apples at (1,5), (3,3), (4,4) in the following turns. I need to monitor the enemy's path to avoid future collisions as we both grow.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is the best move. It scores a point, grows my snake, and is safe.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Based on the provided game state and rules, here is my analysis for Turn 4:\n\n**1. My State:**\n*   **Head:** (0, 6)\n*   **Body:** [(0, 7)]\n*   **Apples:** 1\n*   **Last Move:** DOWN (Moved from (0, 7) to (0, 6)).\n\n**2. Enemy State (Snake #1):**\n*   **Head:** (6, 4)\n*   **Body:** [(6, 3)]\n*   **Apples:** 1\n*   **Position:** Located in the lower middle of the board.\n\n**3. Immediate Threats:**\n*   **Off Board:** Moving LEFT (x = -1) would result in death.\n*   **Self-Collision:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (1, 6): The cell is currently empty. However, I must consider the \"moving backwards\" rule. My body is at (0, 7). To move into my body, I would need to enter (0, 7) from (0, 6). That is the UP direction. Moving RIGHT is physically impossible because there is no body segment connecting (0, 6) to (1, 6). Therefore, moving RIGHT is safe.\n    *   Moving UP to (0, 7): This is the cell I just left (my tail). In standard Snake mechanics, if the tail does not move away this turn (i.e., if I do not eat an apple), moving into the tail's previous position is allowed and safe. Since I am not currently on an apple, moving UP will allow my tail to shift, freeing up (0, 7). Therefore, moving UP is safe.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (0, 5): The cell is empty. Safe.\n*   **Head-on Collision:** The enemy is at (6, 4). They cannot reach (0, 6), (1, 6), or (0, 5) in a single move. Moving UP to (0, 7) is also safe as the enemy is too far away. No immediate head-on collision risk exists for any valid move.\n\n**4. Safe Moves Evaluation:**\n*   **UP (0, 7):** Moves back to previous tail position. No apple here. Leads back to previous state.\n*   **DOWN (0, 5):** Moves toward the bottom of the board. There are apples at (1, 1) and (1, 0) in the bottom-left area. This seems like a path toward food.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 6):** Moves into the open column. There is an apple at (2, 5) and (1, 5) nearby. This moves toward the center of the board where more apples are clustered.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 6):** Off board. Death.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Long Term Goal:** Survive and collect apples efficiently.\n*   **Path Analysis:**\n    *   **Option A (Down):** Moving DOWN to (0, 5) brings me closer to the apples at the bottom-left quadrant ((1, 1), (1, 0)). However, the bottom-left is a corner, which can be a trap if the enemy approaches or if I run out of space. Also, (0, 5) is directly below an apple at (1, 5), which I cannot reach next turn because I am blocked by the wall on my left.\n    *   **Option B (Right):** Moving RIGHT to (1, 6) opens up the board. From (1, 6), I can move to (2, 6), (1, 5), or (1, 7). This keeps my options open and moves me toward the central cluster of apples: (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), etc. The center is generally safer and offers more food than the edges.\n    *   **Option C (Up):** Moving UP to (0, 7) loops back to where I was. It's a neutral move but doesn't progress toward food or better positioning.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 6) is superior to moving DOWN. It transitions me from the edge (x=0) to the interior (x=1), providing access to a wider variety of apples and more movement options in subsequent turns. The apples at (1, 5), (2, 5), and (1, 1) are all accessible from this position.\n\n**6. Enemy Consideration:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 4). It is currently positioned centrally and has access to many apples. I need to secure my own food source in the lower-left/central area before it potentially contests those apples. Moving RIGHT begins the approach to the central apple cluster.\n\n**7. Final Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (1, 6). This is the most flexible and forward-moving option that doesn't lead to immediate danger.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n  - **LEFT (0, 6):** Contains my body (tail). Since I am not eating an apple this turn (I must choose one move), the tail will move forward to (1, 6) at the end of the turn. Moving into the tail's current position is allowed and safe.\n  - **RIGHT (2, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n- **Immediate Death Traps:** None. All 4 moves are potentially safe regarding self-collision and board boundaries.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n- **Head:** (6, 5).\n- **Body:** [(6, 4)].\n- **Behavior:** The enemy is located centrally at x=6. They have access to many apples: (5, 3), (6, 6), (7, 3).\n- **Potential Threat:** If they move LEFT, they could threaten the central apples. If they move UP towards (6, 6), they might grow.\n- **Interaction:** The distance is large. Direct head-on collision this turn is impossible unless they move 5 steps left and I move 4 steps right, which is impossible. I do not need to fear an immediate head-on collision.\n\n**3. Strategic Options & Apples:**\n- **Move DOWN to (1, 5):** This moves onto an **Apple**.\n  - *Pros:* Immediate point gain (score becomes 2). Increases length. Removes an apple from the board, potentially denying it to the enemy if they ever come this way (unlikely given their position).\n  - *Cons:* (1, 5) is a bit isolated on the left edge. However, there are apples at (1, 1) and (1, 0) below, and (2, 5) to the right.\n- **Move UP to (1, 7):**\n  - *Pros:* Moves away from the bottom edge.\n  - *Cons:* (1, 7) is empty. No immediate gain. (1, 8) is empty. The nearest apple is (1, 5) which is DOWN, or (3, 6) which requires navigating.\n- **Move LEFT to (0, 6):**\n  - *Pros:* Keeps position on the edge.\n  - *Cons:* Tight space. No immediate apple.\n- **Move RIGHT to (2, 6):**\n  - *Pros:* Moves toward the center.\n  - *Cons:* No immediate apple. (2, 5) is an apple, but requires a subsequent move DOWN.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI am at (1, 6). The apple at (1, 5) is immediately adjacent and safe to eat. Eating apples is the primary way to score and grow. The enemy is far away (x=6) and cannot contest this apple this turn. Moving DOWN to (1, 5) secures a point and positions me to potentially eat (2, 5) or (1, 1) next. Waiting or moving to empty squares delays scoring.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (1, 5). From there, evaluate the path to (2, 5) or descending to the bottom-left apples ((1, 1), (1, 0)). Monitor the enemy's movement towards the center.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n- **Immediate Death Traps:** Moving LEFT is fatal.\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n- **Head:** (5, 6) (Previously at (6, 6)).\n- **Body:** [(6, 6), (6, 5)].\n- **Behavior:** The enemy moved LEFT to (5, 6). They are likely chasing apples. They are currently at a distance.\n- **Interaction:** No immediate threat of head-on collision this turn, as I am at (2, 5) and they are at (5, 6).\n\n**3. Strategic Options & Apples:**\n- **Move UP to (2, 6):** Empty space. Good for maneuvering. Opens access to (3, 6) and (2, 7).\n- **Move DOWN to (2, 4):** Empty space. Opens access to (3, 4) and (2, 3).\n- **Move RIGHT to (3, 5):** Empty space. Opens access to (4, 5) (an apple) and (3, 6).\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI need to move towards the nearest apples. The apples at (4, 5) and (3, 6) are very close.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (3, 5) positions me directly next to the apple at (4, 5) for the next turn. This is a strong directional move towards the center cluster.\n- Moving **UP** to (2, 6) also positions me next to an apple at (3, 6).\n- Moving **DOWN** seems less optimal as the apples are denser towards the center and upper right.\n\nBetween (3, 5) and (2, 6), (3, 5) offers a slightly better angle on multiple apples ((4, 5) and potentially (5, 3) via (3, 3) or (3, 2)). Also, moving RIGHT gets me away from the left wall where I might get trapped if I turn back.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 5) to position myself adjacent to the apple at (4, 5). From there, I can eat the apple on the next turn or pivot to (3, 6) to target the apple there. I must remain aware of the enemy snake's position to avoid future collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Head:** (3, 5)\n*   **My Body:** [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\n*   **Score:** 3 Apples (Need 27 more to win, but survival is priority).\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 at (4, 6), Body [(5, 6), (6, 6)], Score 2.\n*   **Apples:** (4, 5) is immediately accessible. (3, 6) and (2, 6) are nearby. There is a dense cluster at the bottom left (y=0/1) but moving there is dangerous with my tail currently at (1, 6).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from (3, 5)):**\n*   **UP (3, 6):** This is an apple. It is currently empty (board shows 'A' at 3,6). The enemy is at (4, 6). If I go UP to (3, 6) and the enemy goes LEFT to (4, 5), we do not collide (I am at 3,6, enemy at 4,5). If the enemy goes UP to (5, 7), we do not collide. If the enemy goes DOWN to (4, 5), no collision. However, there is a risk of a head-on collision if the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6). Given the enemy is at (4, 6) and likely chasing the apple at (5, 3) or (4, 5), moving LEFT to (3, 6) is possible but less likely than moving DOWN (4, 5) or UP (5, 7). Eating an apple is high value.\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** Empty. Safe. Moves me away from the enemy at (4, 6). Opens access to (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2). This is a defensive move.\n*   **LEFT (2, 5):** Contains my body. **DANGER.**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 5):** Contains an apple. Empty space. However, the enemy is at (4, 6). If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), it's a head-on collision (both die). The enemy is unlikely to move DOWN if it has other options, but it's a risk. If I eat this apple, I grow. My new body will be [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)].\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nI need to decide between UP (to eat apple at 3,6) and DOWN (defensive).\n*   **Option UP (3, 6):** Eating an apple is always good. The enemy is at (4, 6). If I move UP to (3, 6) and the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), we both die. This is a risk. However, if the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5) or UP to (5, 7), I survive and eat.\n*   **Option DOWN (3, 4):** Completely safe regarding the enemy (distance is 2). Safe regarding myself. However, I miss an apple.\n\nConsidering the win condition requires apples, I should take calculated risks. The enemy at (4, 6) is likely targeting the (5, 3) apple (or surrounding ones) as it is closer to their current position than (3, 6). If the enemy moves DOWN or UP, I am safe.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n```\n 6 . T . A 1 T T . . .\n 5 . T T 0 A . . . . .\n```\nEnemy is at (4, 6). Apple at (4, 5). Apple at (3, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 5):\n- I eat the apple.\n- Enemy at (4, 6) moves. If it moves DOWN to (4, 5), we collide.\n- If I move UP to (3, 6):\n- I eat the apple.\n- Enemy at (4, 6). If it moves LEFT to (3, 6), we collide.\n\nActually, looking at the board again, the apple at (3, 6) is present. The apple at (4, 5) is present.\nLet's look at the enemy's potential moves from (4, 6).\nOptions: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6 - body).\nThe enemy has 2 apples. They are aggressive.\nIf I move UP to (3, 6):\nI eat the apple.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), we die.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), I live.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (4, 7), I live.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 5):\nI eat the apple.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), we die.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), I live.\n\n**Comparison:**\nThe apple at (3, 6) is slightly safer because the enemy is directly above it. The enemy is unlikely to move LEFT into a tight space if it sees an open path UP or DOWN.\nWait, the board shows `(3, 6)` is empty (represented as `A` on the board, but usually apples are marked `A` and bodies `T` or numbers. The board uses `A` for apples. The prompt text lists `(3, 6)` as an apple.\nLet's double check the board rendering.\nRow 6: `6 . T . A 1 T T . . .`\nIndex 3: `.` (Empty)\nIndex 4: `A` (Apple)\nRow 5: `5 . T T 0 A . . . . .`\nIndex 3: `T` (My body)\nIndex 4: `A` (Apple)\nIndex 5: `.` (Empty)\n\nWait, the prompt text says \"Apples at: ... (3, 6) ...\" and the board shows `.` at (3, 6).\nAh, the board ASCII art might be simplified or I am misreading the indices.\nLet's look at the ASCII map carefully.\nRow 6: `6 . T . A 1 T T . . .`\nCol 0: `.` (0,6)\nCol 1: `T` (1,6) - My body tail\nCol 2: `.` (2,6)\nCol 3: `.` (3,6)\nCol 4: `A` (4,6) - Wait, the prompt says Enemy Head is at (4, 6).\nPrompt: \"Snake #1 - Head: (4, 6)\"\nASCII Row 6, Col 4: `A` (Apple? or Enemy?)\nWait, the ASCII shows `1` at (5, 6).\nRow 6: `6 . T . A 1 T T . . .`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(0,6) = `.`\n(1,6) = `T`\n(2,6) = `.`\n(3,6) = `.`\n(4,6) = `A`\n(5,6) = `1`\n(6,6) = `T`\n\nThere is a contradiction or confusing notation in the prompt description vs the ASCII map.\nPrompt text: \"Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (4, 6), Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6)]\"\nASCII Map Row 6: `(4,6)` is `A`, `(5,6)` is `1`, `(6,6)` is `T`.\nIf the prompt text is correct, then the ASCII map is slightly off (maybe `(4,6)` is the apple that was just there or something else).\nHowever, I must rely on the text description of coordinates for my logic because that is the \"game state\".\nText state: Enemy at (4, 6).\nMy state: Head (3, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 5):\nI am at (4, 5). The text lists (4, 5) as an apple.\nIf I move UP to (3, 6):\nI am at (3, 6). The text lists (3, 6) as an apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate risks with the text coordinates.\nEnemy at (4, 6).\nMy options:\n1. UP to (3, 6): Apple is there. Enemy is at (4, 6).\n   - If Enemy moves LEFT -> (3, 6): Collision (Death).\n   - If Enemy moves DOWN -> (4, 5): Safe.\n   - If Enemy moves UP -> (4, 7): Safe.\n   - If Enemy moves RIGHT -> (5, 6): Safe (Body is there, wait, body is at (5, 6) and (6, 6)? Prompt says Body is [(5,6), (6,6)]. If Head is at (4,6), then (5,6) is the body. So Enemy cannot move RIGHT.\n\n2. RIGHT to (4, 5): Apple is there. Enemy is at (4, 6).\n   - If Enemy moves DOWN -> (4, 5): Collision (Death).\n   - If Enemy moves LEFT -> (3, 6): Safe.\n   - If Enemy moves UP -> (4, 7): Safe.\n\n3. DOWN to (3, 4): Empty. No apple.\n   - Very safe regarding enemy.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI am currently at 3 apples. Enemy at 2.\nIf I eat an apple, I grow and lead the score.\nThe enemy is at (4, 6). They are likely looking for apples. (4, 5) is directly below them. (5, 3) is a bit away. (3, 6) is to their left.\nGiven the enemy is at (4, 6), the most likely move for an AI or human (who wants to survive and eat) is DOWN to (4, 5) to eat the apple there.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (4, 5):\n- If I go UP to (3, 6): I survive and eat (3, 6). Enemy eats (4, 5).\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 5): We collide. Both die.\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 4): I survive. Enemy eats.\n\nTherefore, moving UP to (3, 6) is the safer high-reward move compared to moving RIGHT to (4, 5).\nMoving UP gives me a \"slice\" of the board (Left side).\nMoving RIGHT puts me directly in the collision path if the enemy moves DOWN.\nMoving DOWN is safest but yields no points.\n\nLet's verify the board state again.\n`6 . T . A 1 T T . . .`\nThe ASCII shows `A` at (4,6) and `1` at (5,6).\nIf the text description is wrong and the ASCII is correct:\nEnemy Head at (5, 6). Body at (6, 6) and (7, 6)? No, Body is [(6,6), (6,5)] per text.\nLet's trust the text description. It's the most detailed.\nText: Enemy Head (4, 6).\nMy Head (3, 5).\n\nTarget: (3, 6) - Apple.\nReasoning: Avoids the immediate collision path of the enemy moving DOWN.\nAlso, (3, 6) puts me in a better position to control the left side of the board.\nIf I go UP to (3, 6), my body becomes [(3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)].\nFrom (3, 6), I can go to (2, 6) (Apple listed at (2, 6)? No, (2, 6) is empty per text/apples list. Apples listed: (3, 6) is there. (2, 6) is not listed).\nWait, apples listed: (3, 6) is present.\nNext turn from (3, 6):\n- LEFT (2, 6): Empty.\n- RIGHT (4, 6): Enemy (likely moved).\n- UP (3, 7): Empty.\n- DOWN (3, 5): My body (next turn).\n\nSo UP is the move.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**1. My State & Safety Check:**\n*   **Head:** (3, 5) (Moved RIGHT from (2, 5)).\n*   **Body:** [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6)].\n*   **Current Position Analysis:** I am at (3, 5).\n    *   **UP (3, 6):** Contains an apple.

Empty space. **DANGER** (Potential collision with Enemy moving DOWN).\n*   **Immediate Death Traps:** Moving LEFT is fatal (self-collision).\n\n**2. Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 6). Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6)].\n*   **Behavior:** The enemy is directly above me at a distance of 1 unit (vertical).\n*   **Threat Assessment:**\n    *   If the enemy moves **DOWN** to (4, 5), it will collide with me if I move **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n    *   If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (3, 6), it will collide with me if I move **UP** to (3, 6).\n    *   The enemy has apples at (4, 5) directly below it and (5, 3) within reach. The apple at (4, 5) is the most immediate target for the enemy.\n*   **Prediction:** The enemy is highly likely to move **DOWN** to (4, 5) to eat the apple, or move **UP/LEFT** to reposition. Moving **DOWN** is the most aggressive and likely move for a snake chasing apples.\n\n**3. Strategic Options & Apples:**\n*   **Move UP to (3, 6):** Targets the apple at (3, 6). This move is safe *unless* the enemy moves LEFT. Since the enemy is likely moving DOWN (chasing the apple below), moving UP is the statistically safer choice among the apple-eating options.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 5):** Targets the apple at (4, 5). This move is fatal *if* the enemy moves DOWN. Since the enemy is likely moving DOWN, this is a high-risk move.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe and defensive, but misses an apple and gives up territory.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to (3, 6).\n*   **Risk:** If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), we both die. This is a risk, but the enemy has a clear path DOWN to (4, 5) which is an apple. An intelligent opponent will take the guaranteed apple and safety over a risky head-on collision.\n*   **Reward:** I eat an apple, growing my snake and increasing my score lead.\n*   **Positioning:** (3, 6) places me in a good position to access the top-left area or pivot right on the next turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to secure the apple at (3, 6). Anticipate the enemy moving DOWN to (4, 5). From (3, 6), evaluate the board for the next apple target, likely moving LEFT towards (2, 6) or UP, while keeping an eye on the enemy's new position.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7), we are safe. If the enemy moves LEFT+DOWN (hypothetically), still safe. Risk is low. This moves towards the open top-right area.\n*   **DOWN (2, 5):** My own body. **DANGER.**\n*   **LEFT (1, 6):** Empty space (My tail was here, but moved to (1, 5)). Safe regarding walls and self. The enemy is far away. This is a safe move.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 6):** My own body. **DANGER.**\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nI have two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n*   **LEFT (1, 6):** This moves towards the apple at (0, 6). However, looking at the board, (1, 6) is empty, but (1, 5) is my body, (0, 5) is empty, (0, 6) is an apple.\n    If I go LEFT to (1, 6), my options next turn:\n    *   UP (1, 7) - Safe.\n    *   DOWN (1, 5) - My body.\n    *   LEFT (0, 6) - Apple. Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (2, 6) - My body (if I don't eat the apple at (0, 6), but if I eat, I grow, so (2, 6) becomes body and I am at (0, 6), so it's safe? No, if I move to (0, 6) and eat, my body becomes (1, 6), (2, 6)... so (2, 6) is occupied. If I stay at (1, 6) and don't eat, (2, 6) is occupied.\n    *   The path to the left is somewhat constrained by my own body and the wall. (0, 6) is an apple, but beyond that is the wall at x=0.\n*   **UP (2, 7):** This moves into the open space towards the apple cluster at (4, 9), (3, 9), (5, 8).\n    If I go UP to (2, 7), my options next turn:\n    *   UP (2, 8) - Empty.\n    *   DOWN (2, 6) - My body (current head position).\n    *   LEFT (1, 7) - Empty.\n    *   RIGHT (3, 7) - Empty (Unless the enemy moves there, but currently empty).\n    *   This direction offers more space and more apples. The enemy is at (4, 8). If I go UP to (2, 7), I am close to the enemy but not immediately threatening a head-on collision. The enemy is likely to chase apples at (4, 9) or (3, 9).\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (4, 9), I am safe.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 8), I am safe at (2, 7).\n    *   If the enemy moves UP-LEFT (hypothetically), we are safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to (2, 7) is strategically better. It opens up access to the top-right cluster of apples ((4, 9), (3, 9), (5, 8)). Moving LEFT to (1, 6) commits me to a narrow path with only one apple nearby (0, 6) before hitting the wall.\nTherefore, I will move UP.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

(The tail (1, 5) moved to (2, 5)? No, let's trace. Previous body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. Head moved UP to (2, 7). New body: [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. The tail (1, 5) didn't move because the head didn't eat. Wait, the prompt says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\". The body is listed as [(2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5)]. This implies the tail (1, 5) is gone. Did I eat an apple? No. Did the body just shift? Yes. The prompt's \"Body\" list represents the current state. So the body is effectively (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). The previous tail (1,5) is gone.\n*   **Score:** 4 Apples.\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (4, 9). Previous head was (4, 8). It moved UP.

Move Evaluation (from (2, 7)):**\n*   **UP (2, 8):** Empty space. Safe regarding walls and self. The enemy head is at (4, 9). Distance is (2, 8) vs (4, 9). Manhattan distance is |4-2| + |9-8| = 3. The enemy is close. If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 9), it is safe. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8), it is safe. If the enemy moves LEFT-DOWN (3, 8), it is safe.\n    *   *Risk Check:* Could the enemy move to (2, 8)? No, Manhattan distance from (4, 9) to (2, 8) is 3. Max move per turn is 1. So (2, 8) is safe from collision.\n    *   *Apple Check:* Is there an apple at (2, 8)? No. Is there an apple nearby? (5, 8) is 3 units away. (3, 9) is adjacent to the enemy.\n*   **DOWN (2, 6):** My own body. **DANGER.**\n*   **LEFT (1, 7):** Empty space. Safe regarding walls and self. The enemy is far away.\n    *   *Apple Check:* (0, 6) is an apple, distance 2. (1, 1) is an apple, distance 5. (1, 0) is an apple, distance 6.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 7):** Empty space. Safe regarding walls and self.\n    *   *Apple Check:* (5, 8) is distance 2. (4, 9) is distance 3 (but enemy is there). (4, 4) is distance 3.\n    *   *Risk Check:* If I move to (3, 7), the enemy moves. The enemy is at (4, 9). If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 9), safe. If enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8), safe. If enemy moves LEFT-DOWN (3, 8), safe. Manhattan distance from (4, 9) to (3, 7) is |4-3| + |9-7| = 3. Safe.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n*   **UP (2, 8):** Moves towards the top wall and (5, 8) and (3, 9). However, (2, 8) is a \"dead end\" relative to my current body. If I go UP to (2, 8), I have UP (2, 9), LEFT (1, 8), RIGHT (3, 8), DOWN (2, 7). That's 3 options.\n*   **LEFT (1, 7):** Moves towards (0, 6). If I go LEFT to (1, 7), I have UP (1, 8), LEFT (1, 6), DOWN (1, 6?) No, (1, 6) is empty. Wait, previous body was (2,6). My new body ends at (2,5). (1, 6) is empty. So LEFT to (1, 7) gives UP (1, 8), DOWN (1, 6), LEFT (0, 7). (1, 6) is safe.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 7):** Moves into the central area. If I go RIGHT to (3, 7), I have UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6). (3, 6) is my body. So DOWN is blocked. LEFT (2, 7) is my previous head (now body). So effectively only UP is safe? No, RIGHT (4, 7) is empty. Wait, is (4, 7) empty? The board shows `T` at (4, 7) (Enemy body). So RIGHT (4, 7) is occupied by enemy body.\n    *   So from (3, 7):\n        *   UP (3, 8): Empty.\n        *   DOWN (3, 6): My body.\n        *   LEFT (2, 7): My body.\n        *   RIGHT (4, 7): Enemy body.\n    *   **TRAP ALERT:** Moving RIGHT to (3, 7) leaves me with only ONE safe move (UP) for the next turn. This is extremely dangerous. If the enemy moves to block (3, 8), I die.\n*   **UP (2, 8) vs LEFT (1, 7):**\n    *   From (2, 8): Options are UP (2, 9), LEFT (1, 8), RIGHT (3, 8). (DOWN is body). 3 options.\n    *   From (1, 7): Options are UP (1, 8), LEFT (0, 7), DOWN (1, 6). 3 options.\n    *   **Safety:** LEFT (1, 7) is furthest from the enemy head at (4, 9).\n    *   **Apples:** (0, 6) is accessible via LEFT then DOWN. (5, 8) is accessible via RIGHT then UP. The apple at (5, 8) is closer to the enemy (distance 1 from (4, 8)). The enemy is likely to grab (5, 8) or (3, 9).\n    *   **Tactical:** Moving LEFT puts me in a safer corner (top-left is open, bottom-left has apples). Moving UP puts me in the center of the board where the enemy is active.\n    *   **Decision:** LEFT is the safest move. It avoids the enemy's immediate area and opens up a path to apples (0, 6) and (1, 1) without immediate confrontation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 7) is strategically better. It keeps me safe from the enemy and maintains multiple escape routes. Moving RIGHT to (3, 7) is a trap (only one way out). Moving UP to (2, 8) is okay but exposes me to the enemy. LEFT is the optimal survival and positioning move.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN & STRATEGY**\n\nLEFT",

But (3, 9) is right next to the enemy. The enemy is very likely to take (3, 9) or (5, 8). (5, 8) is also close (distance 2).\n*   **DOWN (1, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   *Future:* From (1, 6), I can go DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6), RIGHT (2, 6). (UP is body).\n    *   *Proximity:* Moves closer to (0, 6) (distance 1). Moves closer to (1, 1) and (1, 0) (distance 5/6). This is the path to the bottom-left corner apples, which are safer and not contested by the enemy.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** Empty.

Strategic Decision:**\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n*   **UP (1, 8):** This path (1, 8) -> (1, 9) -> (2, 9) -> (3, 9) brings me into direct competition with the enemy for the apple at (3, 9). The enemy is at (4, 9) and can easily take (3, 9) or block me. Engaging the enemy near his body is risky. If the enemy takes (3, 9), he grows, and his tail might shift, potentially blocking my path.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** This is a good move to secure the apple at (0, 6). However, (0, 7) is on the left wall. From (0, 7), I have limited moves (UP, DOWN). It restricts my movement compared to (1, 6).\n*   **DOWN (1, 6):** This is the optimal move.\n    *   It moves me towards the cluster of apples at (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 6), (2, 1), (2, 0).\n    *   It keeps me away from the enemy at (4, 9).\n    *   From (1, 6), I have access to (1, 5) (DOWN) and (0, 6) (LEFT). (1, 5) is currently empty (my body is at (2, 5)). This path is open and safe.\n    *   The apple at (0, 6) is a low-risk, high-reward target. The enemy is unlikely to come all the way to (0, 6) while (3, 9) and (5, 8) are available.\n    *   Securing (1, 6) and then (1, 5) (or (0, 6)) sets up a safe farming route in the bottom-left corner.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (1, 6) is the best strategic move. It prioritizes safety (avoiding the enemy), future mobility (staying off walls), and resource access (heading towards the bottom-left apple cluster). It avoids the confrontation over the top-right apples.\n\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN & STRATEGY**\n\nDOWN",

It is likely chasing the apples at (3, 9) or (5, 8).\n*   **Apples:** (0, 6) is immediately adjacent to my left. (1, 1) and (1, 0) are further down the column. (3, 9) and (5, 8) are near the enemy.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from (1, 6)):**\n*   **UP (1, 7):** My own body. **DANGER.**\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** Empty. Safe. Moves towards the apple cluster (1, 1), (1, 0). However, I am currently at y=6. My body includes (3, 6) and (2, 6). If I move DOWN to (1, 5), I will be creating a \"U-turn\" shape relative to my previous position. Specifically, if I then try to move LEFT to (0, 5) and then UP to (0, 6), I risk cutting off my own tail's retreat path unless I eat an apple immediately. Let's look at the immediate geometry. My body is at (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6). If I go DOWN to (1,5), I am safe. If I go DOWN again to (1,4), I am safe. But moving DOWN immediately is a \"safe\" move that doesn't lock me in.\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** **Apple!** This is the move.\n    *   *Safety:* (0, 6) is empty. It is not occupied by my body or the enemy body. It is not off-board.\n    *   *Gain:* I eat an apple, growing by 1 segment. My score becomes 5, taking the lead.\n    *   *Future:* After eating, my body will be [(0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6)]. The tail will be at (3, 6) initially, then move forward. From (0, 6), I can go UP (0, 7), DOWN (0, 5), or LEFT (Wall). (0, 7) and (0, 5) are currently empty (my body will be elsewhere). This opens up the left wall safely.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** My own body. **DANGER.**\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the optimal move.\n*   **Immediate Advantage:** It scores an apple, putting me ahead 5-4.\n*   **Safety:** It is a valid, empty cell.\n*   **Positioning:** It secures a position on the left side of the board, away from the enemy at (3, 8). The enemy is currently focused on the top-right apples (3, 9) and (5, 8). While I secure the bottom-left apples, the enemy is unlikely to challenge me there immediately.\n*   **Risk Avoidance:** Moving DOWN is safe but delays scoring. Moving UP or RIGHT are fatal. Therefore, LEFT is the only scoring move and is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove **LEFT** to eat the apple at (0, 6). This secures points and safely repositions me on the edge, away from the immediate threat of the enemy.\n\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN & STRATEGY**\n\nLEFT",

The \"Score so far\" confirms 5 apples, and the board state in the prompt lists the apple at (0,6) as \"T\" (Tail/Empty) in the grid visual.\n*   **Enemy State:** Snake #1 is at Head (3, 7), Body [(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8)].

(0, 4) and (0, 3) are reachable via DOWN.\n    *   Apples elsewhere: (1, 0), (1, 1), etc.\n*   **Enemy Analysis:** The enemy snake #1 is at (3, 7). The closest apples to the enemy are (3, 9) (2 steps away) and (5, 8) (approx 3 steps away). The enemy is likely moving UP or RIGHT.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (3, 8), it might target (3, 9) next.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 7), it might target (5, 8) or (4, 4).\n    *   The enemy is not currently in a position to directly block my moves to the bottom left apples.\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **DOWN (0, 5):** Moves directly toward an apple at (0, 5). Opens up the bottom-left corner (0, 4), (0, 3), etc. My body is currently at (1, 6) and (1, 7). Moving DOWN keeps the \"channel\" (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> ... open. My body trailing at (1, 6) ensures that if I continue down, the path remains open for a loop back up the right side if needed, or I can just eat the apples in the corner.\n    *   **UP (0, 7):** Moves away from the immediate apple at (0, 5). The path at (0, 7) is empty, but moving UP takes me further from the bottom-left cluster where I have a clear advantage. The enemy is at y=7/8. If I go UP, I move closer to the enemy's zone (top-left/middle), risking interception or getting cornered. If I go DOWN, I secure the corner.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** is optimal.\n1.  **Objective:** I need to eat apples to win. The apples at (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3) are the safest and most accessible targets.\n2.  **Safety:** Moving DOWN to (0, 5) is empty. My body at (1, 6) and (1, 7) does not block this path.\n3.  **Positioning:** By moving DOWN, I claim the left edge. The enemy is top-right. This minimizes collision risks.\n4.  **Future Options:** From (0, 5), I can continue DOWN to (0, 4) and (0, 3). I can also move RIGHT to (1, 5) if needed (though (1, 6) is currently occupied by my body, it will move). Moving UP to (0, 6) is currently occupied by my body (the segment just moved there), so if I go DOWN now, I effectively shift my body down, keeping (0, 6) clear for potential future use if I loop around.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove **DOWN** to secure the apple at (0, 5) and position myself to eat the subsequent apples at (0, 4) and (0, 3) safely.\n\nDOWN",

Score: 5.\n- **Enemy Status:** Head at (4, 7), Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9)]. Score: 4.\n- **Board Context:** I am at (0, 5). Adjacent cells:\n    - **UP (0, 6):** My own body (segment (0, 6)). **INVALID (Death).**\n    - **DOWN (0, 4):** Empty (based on board state \"0 . . . . A . . . . .\" at row 5, and row 4 being \" . . . . A . A . . . .\"). **VALID.**\n    - **LEFT (-1, 5):** Off-board. **INVALID (Death).**\n    - **RIGHT (1, 5):** Empty. **VALID.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n1.  **Immediate Survival:** I must avoid UP (into self) and LEFT (off-board). My only safe moves are DOWN to (0, 4) or RIGHT to (1, 5).\n2.  **Apple Pursuit:** There is an apple at (0, 4) directly below me. Moving DOWN consumes this apple, increasing my score to 6 and growing my length.\n3.  **Safety & Future Options:**\n    -   **Moving RIGHT to (1, 5):** While empty, this moves me towards the center where the enemy snake is active. More importantly, it moves me *away* from the tight cluster of apples in the bottom-left corner (0,4, 0,3, etc.). I would lose the immediate apple and potentially face head-on collision risks with the enemy in the center lanes.\n    -   **Moving DOWN to (0, 4):** This secures an apple. It keeps me pinned against the left wall, which minimizes directions I can be attacked from. The enemy is currently at (4, 7), far away and moving in its own region. By staying on the left edge, I avoid interception. From (0, 4), I can continue down to (0, 3) (also an apple) or have the option to move right to (1, 4) if the path opens up, but staying on the edge is currently safer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the optimal choice. It guarantees an apple score, maintains safety by keeping me on the board edge, and positions me to chain-eat the apples at (0, 3) and (0, 2) in subsequent turns.\n\nDOWN",

(The previous turn I moved DOWN from (0, 5) to (0, 4)).\n        *   **Current Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7)].\n        *   **Score:** 5 apples.\n        *   **Length:** 6 segments.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n        *   **Current Head:** (4, 6).\n        *   **Current Body:** [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n        *   **Score:** 4 apples.\n    *   **Apples:** 15 apples are listed. The board visualization shows apples at the relevant coordinates (e.g., (0, 3) is an apple, (1, 3) is an apple, (1, 0) is an apple, (4, 4) is an apple, etc.).\n    *   **Board Geometry:** 10x10, (0,0) is bottom-left.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Moves from (0, 4):**\n    *   **Current Position (0, 4):**\n        *   **Up (0, 5):** Occupied by my own body segment (0, 5). **INVALID (Death).**\n        *   **Left (-1, 4):** Off the board. **INVALID (Death).**\n        *   **Right (1, 4):** Check board state. Looking at the ASCII map (Row 4: `0 . . . A . A . . . .`), the cell at x=1, y=4 is empty. **SAFE.**\n        *   **Down (0, 3):** Check board state. Looking at the ASCII map (Row 3: `. . . A . A . A . . .`), the cell at x=0, y=3 is an apple. **SAFE (Apple).**\n\n3.  **Compare Valid Moves (Right vs. Down):**\n    *   **Option 1: Move RIGHT to (1, 4)**\n        *   **Immediate Reward:** No apple (empty space).\n        *   **Future Safety:**\n            *   From (1, 4), I would be next to my own body at (0, 5) (above-left) and (1, 6) (above). This narrows my future paths.\n            *   Moving towards the center exposes me to the enemy snake at (4, 6). The enemy is currently positioned on the right side.\n            *   The cell (1, 4) leads into a bottleneck. To my Right (2, 4) is an apple, but then I would be closer to the enemy's territory. To my Up (1, 5) is empty (based on previous analysis), but then I am moving away from the dense cluster of apples on the left wall.\n    *   **Option 2: Move DOWN to (0, 3)**\n        *   **Immediate Reward:** **Apple at (0, 3)**. My score becomes 6, and I grow. This is crucial for leading the score.\n        *   **Future Safety:**\n            *   The Left wall (x=0) acts as a hard barrier, protecting me from attacks from that side.\n            *   From (0, 3), I have immediate access to another apple at (1, 3) (Right) or (0, 2) (Down).\n            *   **Crucial Observation:** There is an apple at (1, 0) and (2, 0). By moving DOWN to (0, 3), I position myself to slide down the left wall (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0). This is a very safe route that collects multiple apples (0,3 and potentially 0,2 or 1,0) without exposing myself to the enemy, who is currently at (4, 6) on the opposite side of the board.\n\n4.  **Strategic Assessment:**\n    *   **Enemy Position:** The enemy is at (4, 6). They are far away and currently blocked by their own body if they try to rush the left side. They are likely focused on the apples in the center (like (4, 4)).\n    *   **Scoring:** I am winning 5 to 4. Eating an apple extends my lead to 6 to 4.\n    *   **Control:** Sticking to the left wall maximizes my control over my immediate environment. Moving Right to (1, 4) puts me in a more open, dangerous area with more variables.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Moving **DOWN** to (0, 3) is the optimal move. It secures a guaranteed point, maintains my position on the safe left edge, and opens a clear path to chain more apples at (1, 3) or (0, 2) in subsequent turns, all while keeping the enemy snake on the other side of the board.\n\nDOWN",

I must rely on the current explicit game state provided at the start of this prompt.\n\n**Analysis of Turn 17:**\n\n1.  **Current Positions:**\n    *   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at **(0, 3)**.\n        *   Body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7)].\n        *   *Observation:* My head is currently on an apple at (0, 3) (confirmed by the apples list and the board map at y=3, x=0). This suggests I likely moved DOWN from (0, 4) on the previous turn (matching the \"Last Move\" info). I am currently growing.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(4, 5)**.\n        *   Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n        *   *Observation:* The enemy has moved from (4, 6) to (4, 5). This is a **DOWN** move. They are approaching the center cluster of apples.\n\n2.  **Board State & Apples:**\n    *   **Apples at:** (1, 1), (4, 4), (5, 3), (9, 7), (3, 3), (7, 3), (5, 8), (1, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0), (6, 4), (7, 0), (8, 2), (8, 8), (9, 9).\n    *   **Key Apples near me:**\n        *   (0, 3): Currently occupied by my head.\n        *   (1, 3): An apple is NOT listed here. The board map at Row 3 shows `0 . . A . A . A . . .` meaning x=1, y=3 is empty. (The \"Last Rationale\" mentioned (1, 3), but that was based on a previous board state).\n        *   (1, 1): Directly below and to the right of my current position.\n        *   (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1): Apples at the bottom left corner.\n    *   **Enemy Proximity:** The enemy at (4, 5) is closer to the central apples (4, 4), (3, 3), (5, 3), (6, 4). They are positioned to cut off access to the center.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Moves from (0, 3):**\n    *   **UP (0, 4):**\n        *   Current State: (0, 4) is occupied by my own body (first body segment).\n        *   Outcome: **Death**. Invalid move.\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 3):**\n        *   Off the board (x < 0).\n        *   Outcome: **Death**. Invalid move.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 3):**\n        *   Current State: Empty. No apple. Safe.\n        *   Future: From (1, 3), I have options (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4). However, moving Right puts me directly adjacent to the enemy's potential path (they are at 4,5; I am at 1,3). I would be moving into the open center.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 2):**\n        *   Current State: The board map at Row 2 shows `. . . . . . . . A .` (x=0, y=2 is empty). Safe.\n        *   Future: This keeps me hugging the left wall. From (0, 2), I can move to (0, 1), then (0, 0) or (1, 0).\n        *   Apples: (1, 1) is reachable. (1, 0) and (2, 0) are reachable. This path is isolated from the enemy at (4, 5).\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   The enemy (ID 1) has moved down to (4, 5), positioning itself for the apples in the center (like 4,4, 3,3, 5,3).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (1, 3), I enter the central area where the enemy is likely heading. This increases the risk of a head-on collision or being trapped.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (0, 2), I retreat toward the bottom-left corner. This is a safe zone where I can collect the remaining apples there ((1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)) without immediate interference from the enemy. The enemy is currently blocking the path from the center to the bottom left (at 4,5), but since I am already on the wall, I can collect the corner apples and then loop back up if necessary.\n    *   Securing the bottom-left corner apples is a high-value, low-risk play. It guarantees points and keeps my body contained on the wall, preventing self-collision.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (0, 2) is the safest move that maintains my score lead and secures future points in the corner.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)].\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(4, 4)**. Body: [(4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n    *   **Apples:** There is an apple at **(1, 1)** which is directly adjacent to my head (0, 2) to the right and down-left. There are also apples at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1) in the bottom-left corner.\n    *   **Board Map:**\n        *   Row 2: `. . . . . . . . A .` (My head is at 0,2). The cell (1, 2) is empty.\n        *   Row 1: `. A A . . . . . . .` (Apples at 1,1 and 2,1).\n        *   Row 0: `. A A . . . . . A .` (Apples at 1,0, 2,0, and 8,0).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from (0, 2):**\n    *   **UP (0, 3):** The board shows Row 3 starts with `T`. My own body occupies (0, 3). **Result: Death (Self-collision).**\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 2):** x = -1 is off the board. **Result: Death (Wall collision).**\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 2):** The board at (1, 2) is empty (represented by `.` in Row 2). This is a valid move. It moves me toward the apple at (1, 1) or (2, 1).\n    *   **DOWN (0, 1):** The board at (0, 1) is empty (Row 1 starts with `.`). This is a valid move.\n\n3.  **Strategic Comparison of RIGHT vs DOWN:**\n    *   **Option: RIGHT (1, 2)**\n        *   *Pros:* Moves me closer to the apple at (1, 1) and (2, 1). Keeps me on the edge but off the immediate wall.\n        *   *Cons:* Opens up potential paths to the center (2,2, 3,2, etc.), which could eventually lead me into conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is currently at (4, 4), preparing for the center apples.\n    *   **Option: DOWN (0, 1)**\n        *   *Pros:* Keeps me hugging the left wall, ensuring a safe path to the bottom-left corner apples ((1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)). This isolates me from the enemy's current trajectory in the center.\n        *   *Cons:* The cell (0, 1) is empty. From there, I can move to (0, 0) or (1, 1) next. This is a flexible and safe position.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   The enemy snake is actively moving into the center (from 4,5 to 4,4), likely to eat the apples at (4,4), (3,3), etc. To maximize my score and survival, I should secure the apples in the bottom-left corner that are not contested by the enemy.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (0, 1) is the safer choice because it keeps me strictly on the left wall, minimizing the risk of encountering the enemy or getting trapped. From (0, 1), I can easily pivot to collect (1, 1) or (0, 0) on the next turn.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (1, 2) is also valid, but DOWN offers better long-term isolation and control of the corner territory.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the bottom-left corner apples ((1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)) by hugging the left wall. Avoid the center to prevent head-on collisions with the enemy snake who is moving toward the central cluster.\n\nDOWN",

My body currently occupies (0, 2) through (0, 6).\n*   **Enemy Head:** (5, 4). Enemy body occupies [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)].\n*   **Target:** The immediate targets are apples at (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n*   **Board Status:** My last move was DOWN to (0, 1). The cell (0, 2) will move to (0, 1) in the next turn logic (simultaneous movement), meaning the segment at (0, 2) will shift to (0, 1). The tail (0, 6) will vacate (0, 6) unless I eat an apple.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **LEFT (-1, 1):** Off the board. **DEAD.**\n*   **UP (0, 2):** My body is currently at (0, 2). Even though the body moves, moving into the immediate path of your own tail is a collision. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN (0, 0):** The board at (0, 0) is currently empty (represented by `.`). This is a safe move, but it leads to a dead end. From (0, 0), the only moves would be UP (back to (0, 1)) or RIGHT (to (1, 0)). If I go DOWN, I will eventually be forced to turn right at (1, 0), (2, 0), or (3, 0). The enemy is in the center but heading toward (5, 4). While I wouldn't be in immediate danger, I'd be funneling myself into a narrow corridor.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 1):** The board at (1, 1) shows an apple (`A`). This is a target.\n    *   **Safety:** Is (1, 1) occupied by the enemy? No. Enemy is at (5, 4).\n    *   **Future Moves:** Moving to (1, 1) opens up:\n        *   UP to (1, 2) [Empty]\n        *   RIGHT to (2, 1) [Apple]\n        *   DOWN to (1, 0) [Apple]\n        *   LEFT to (0, 1) [Will be empty as my body moves]\n    *   This gives me high flexibility to eat the cluster of apples in the bottom-left ((1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)) without trapping myself.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 1) is strictly superior to DOWN.\n*   **Immediate Gain:** I collect an apple (+1 score).\n*   **Positioning:** It moves me off the extreme edge into the active corner. This allows me to pivot into the open space if the enemy suddenly shifts toward my side (though unlikely given their position), but more importantly, it gives me the reach to eat the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 0) efficiently.\n*   **Avoiding Stagnation:** Staying at (0, 0) limits my immediate next turn choices. (1, 1) is a central node for the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the bottom-left apple cluster ((1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)) by hugging the bottom-left quadrant. Maintain awareness of the enemy at (5, 4) but prioritize score accumulation. If the enemy moves aggressively left, I will retreat into the wall.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No. Enemy is far right.\n    *   *Blockage Check:* Is it occupied by my body? No. My body is currently at (0, 1), (0, 2)... and will move to (1, 1), (0, 1)...\n    *   *Future Options:* Moving to (2, 1) keeps the bottom edge open. From (2, 1), I can access (2, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2), or retreat to (1, 1).\n*   **UP (1, 2):**\n    *   *Safety Check:* Currently empty on the board.\n    *   *Future Options:* Limited. Leads to (1, 3), which borders the snake body at (0, 3).

While safe, it is a restrictive position compared to (2, 1).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nComparing **RIGHT (2, 1)** vs **DOWN (1, 0)** and **UP (1, 2)**:\n*   **RIGHT (2, 1)** is the most central move in the bottom-left quadrant. It allows access to the cluster of apples at (2, 1), (2, 0), and (3, 1).\n*   **DOWN (1, 0)** is also an apple, but it forces me to the edge. While I can eat (2, 0) next, (1, 1) will be occupied by my own body (the segment shifting from 0,1), and (0, 0) is a trap.\n*   **RIGHT** maximizes future freedom. From (2, 1), I can pivot to eat (2, 0) or (3, 1) or (1, 2). From (1, 0), I am cornered against the wall and the board boundary.\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 4) and appears to be moving generally upward or rightward (based on body direction), posing no immediate threat to the bottom-left quadrant. Securing the apple at (2, 1) is the safest way to gain a point while maintaining the ability to clear the rest of the bottom-left apples efficiently.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the bottom-left apple cluster efficiently. Move to (2, 1) to eat the apple there. From there, the sequence (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) will clear the available apples in the area. Avoid getting stuck at the bottom edge (y=0) unless necessary. Monitor the enemy's turn 21 movement to ensure they aren't turning left aggressively.\n\nRIGHT",

My tail (0, 6) moves to (0, 5), vacating (0, 6).\n*   **Enemy Position (Snake #1):** Head at (6, 3), Body [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7)].\n    *   *Observation:* Enemy is at (6, 3). The cell (5, 3) contains an apple. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 4), they are blocked by their own body. If they move DOWN to (6, 2), they are safe. If they move LEFT to (5, 3), they will eat the apple and grow.\n    *   *Threat Assessment:* If the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 3), their head enters (5, 3). This does not immediately threaten me at (2, 1), but I must be aware of their expansion.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **Current Head (2, 1):** Just ate an apple.\n*   **LEFT (1, 1):**\n    *   *Occupancy:* Currently contains my body segment.\n    *   *Future State:* After my move, my body segment currently at (1, 1) moves to (2, 1). Therefore, (1, 1) will be empty *after* the movement of my body but *before* my head moves there. **Correction:** This logic is flawed for simultaneous movement. The check must be based on the state *before* movement.\n    *   *Immediate Danger:* My body is currently at (1, 1). Moving there causes a collision. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1):**\n    *   *Board State:* Empty (based on the visual map and coordinate list).\n    *   *Apple:* No apple at (3, 1).\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self. Safe from enemy (Enemy is at x=6).\n    *   *Future:* From (3, 1), I can access (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 0), or retreat to (2, 1).\n*   **UP (2, 2):**\n    *   *Board State:* Empty.\n    *   *Apple:* No apple.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Future:* From (2, 2), I can access (2, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2). However, (2, 3) leads toward the vertical wall of my own body at x=0 (0,3). This is a tight corridor.\n*   **DOWN (2, 0):**\n    *   *Board State:* Contains an apple (`A`).\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from self. Safe from enemy.\n    *   *Future:* Eating the apple at (2, 0) gives me a point. From (2, 0), I can access (3, 0) (Apple), (1, 0) (Apple), or UP to (2, 1) (which will be occupied by my body segment moving from 1,1). Wait, let's re-evaluate (2, 1).\n        *   *Simulation:* I move DOWN to (2, 0). My body segment at (1, 1) moves to (2, 1).\n        *   *Result:* (2, 1) becomes occupied by my body.\n        *   *Next Turn:* If I am at (2, 0), I can move LEFT to (1, 0) (Apple), RIGHT to (3, 0) (Apple), or UP to (2, 1) (Death by self). This leaves me with 2 valid moves.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\nComparing **DOWN (2, 0)** vs **RIGHT (3, 1)**:\n*   **DOWN (2, 0)** secures an apple immediately. It keeps me on the bottom row, which is usually a trap, but in this specific board state, the bottom row (y=0) is relatively open for me. The apples at (1, 0) and (3, 0) are close. Eating (2, 0) expands my body length, which is necessary to grow, but slightly limits future movement options on the subsequent turn (only 2 safe moves from (2, 0)).\n*   **RIGHT (3, 1)** does not secure an apple. It moves me to an empty cell. While this preserves the apple at (2, 0) for a potential later turn, it allows the enemy to potentially claim apples elsewhere. Given the score is tied (7-7), securing an apple is high priority.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the apple at (2, 0) immediately. From there, the best path to continue scoring without getting trapped is to move to (3, 0) or (1, 0) next. I will target the apple at (3, 0) next if it is safe, as it opens up access to (4, 0) and eventually (5, 0). I must avoid getting pinned against the wall by my own growing body.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

The enemy snake (Snake #1) is currently occupying the region between x=3 and x=6, effectively blocking access to the right side of the board. To regain access to the abundant apples at x=8 and x=9, I must force the enemy out of this area.\n\nThe most effective way to do this is to move aggressively towards the enemy's territory. If I move to (3, 0), the enemy (currently moving DOWN at (7, 3)) will likely perceive the center as contested and move further right or down. To maximize this pressure, I will move to (3, 0) to position myself closer to the gap at (4, 0).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n1.  **Collision at (3, 0):** The enemy is at (7, 3) moving DOWN to (7, 2). They cannot reach (3, 0) this turn. My own body is at (2, 0) and (1, 0) next turn (after I move). (3, 0) is safe.\n2.  **Apple Consumption:** There is an apple at (3, 0). Eating it allows me to maintain my lead or keep pace with the enemy.\n3.  **Future Mobility:** From (3, 0), I will have access to (4, 0), (3, 1), and (2, 0). (4, 0) is critical as it is the gateway to the right side of the board (x=5 to x=9), where many apples are located.\n\nThis move secures a point and pressures the opponent to retreat, clearing the path to high-value targets.\n\nLEFT",

The tail is currently at (0, 6). The new tail position (before consuming any apple) will be the second-to-last element of my current body: (0, 5). My new body will be [(New Head), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)].\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1**:\n    -   **Head**: (8, 3) with Body reaching down to (4, 7).\n    -   **Movement Prediction**: Snake #1 is currently at x=8. The region x=3-6 is crowded with its own body and potential blocking. To outmaneuver me or find apples, it is likely to move towards the right edge (x=9) or down into the clearer areas (x=7, y=2 or y=1).\n    -   **Collision Risk**: If I move to (1, 1) or (2, 1), I am entering the y-range where the enemy is currently located (y=3). However, the distance is large. The enemy would need multiple turns to reach me.\n\n3.  **Apple Positions**:\n    -   **Apple at (1, 1)**: This is 1 step away (Right).\n    -   **Apple at (0, 2)**: This is inside my own body (currently at (0, 2)). If I move Left to (-1, 0), I die (out of bounds). If I move Up to (1, 1), I don't reach this apple.\n    -   **Apple at (0, 5)**: This is currently occupied by my body (specifically, (0, 5) is the 6th element of my body). If I eat an apple elsewhere, my tail won't move, and (0, 5) remains a hazard. If I don't eat, my tail moves to (0, 5), freeing it up for my head.\n    -   **Apple at (5, 0)**: High value, but requires navigating through (2, 0) (my body) and potentially enemy territory.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Moves**:\n    -   **LEFT (-1, 0)**: Invalid (Off board).\n    -   **DOWN (1, -1)**: Invalid (Off board).\n    -   **UP (1, 1)**:\n        -   Target: Contains Apple.\n        -   Safety: My body will be [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)...]. The head moves to (1, 1). The body moves *into* (1, 1) as well. This creates a self-collision (Head occupies cell 1, Body part 1 also occupies cell 1). **This move results in immediate death.**\n    -   **RIGHT (2, 0)**:\n        -   Target: Empty.\n        -   Safety: My body will be [(2, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1)...]. The head moves to (2, 0). The body moves: the old head (1, 0) goes to index 1, the old body part (2, 0) goes to index 2.\n        -   **Collision Check**: Head at (2, 0). Body part at index 2 is also (2, 0). This means the head collides with the body part that was previously at (2, 0) (which shifted to index 2). **This move also results in immediate self-collision.**\n\n5.  **Re-evaluating Last Turn's Move**:\n    -   The prompt states: \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\".\n    -   **Head**: (1, 0).\n    -   **Body**: Starts with (2, 0).\n    -   If the head is at (1, 0) and the body starts with (2, 0), the connection is: (1, 0) -> (2, 0). This implies the snake is facing **Right** (Head left of body? No, Head (1, 0) -> Body (2, 0) means the body is to the *right* of the head).\n    -   **Wait**: Head (1, 0). Body (2, 0). The vector from Head to Body is (1, 0). The Head is looking in the **Right** direction.\n    -   **The \"Left\" Move**: If the snake moved **Left** from (2, 0) to (1, 0), the Head would be at (1, 0) and the previous head (2, 0) would become the new body part. This matches the current state exactly.\n    -   **Correction on Self-Collision for RIGHT**:\n        -   If I move **RIGHT** to (2, 0):\n        -   New Head: (2, 0).\n        -   Old Head: (1, 0) -> New Body index 1.\n        -   Old Body index 1: (2, 0) -> New Body index 2.\n        -   New Head (2, 0) collides with New Body index 2 (2, 0). **DEAD.**\n    -   **Correction on Self-Collision for UP**:\n        -   If I move **UP** to (1, 1):\n        -   New Head: (1, 1).\n        -   Old Head: (1, 0) -> New Body index 1.\n        -   Old Body index 1: (2, 0) -> New Body index 2.\n        -   Old Body index 2: (2, 1) -> New Body index 3.\n        -   Old Body index 3: (1, 1) -> New Body index 4.\n        -   New Head (1, 1) collides with New Body index 4 (1, 1). **DEAD.**\n\n6.  **The Survival Move**:\n    -   Both UP and RIGHT lead to self-collision because the body is looping back on itself near the head.\n    -   **Wait, let's look at the body again**: `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]`\n    -   The body forms a U-shape.

LEFT\"\n    -   \"Last Rationale: ... I will move to (3, 0) ... LEFT\"\n    -   **Wait**, the current Head is (1, 0).\n    -   If the rationale said \"Move to (3, 0)\" and the move was \"LEFT\", then the previous position must have been (2, 0) or (4, 0)?\n    -   Actually, if the move was LEFT, and the result is (1, 0), the previous position was (2, 0).\n    -   The Body starts with (2, 0).\n    -   If I was at (2, 0) and moved LEFT to (1, 0):\n        -   My body at that time was `[(2, 0), ...]`? No, that's impossible. The head cannot be at (2, 0) and the body start with (2, 0).\n        -   Let's look at the body list again: `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), ...]`\n        -   If I moved Left to (1, 0):\n            -   Previous Head: (2, 0).\n            -   Previous Body[0]: (2, 1).\n            -   So previous state was Head (2, 0), Body starting (2, 1)...\n            -   Current State: Head (1, 0). Body[0] is (2, 0) (which was the old head).\n            -   This is consistent. The snake moved Left.\n\n    -   **Back to current survival**:\n        -   UP: Hits Body[4] (1, 1).
