I am at (0, 6) and the enemy is at (1, 6).\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Apple Distances**:\n    *   **Me (1)**: Closest apples are at (2, 8) (4 moves via Up) and (1, 1) (6 moves via Down).\n    *   **Enemy (0)**: Closest apples are at (2, 8) (3 moves via Up) and (1, 1) (5 moves via Down).\n    *   The enemy is 1 move closer to *every* apple because they are at x=1 and I am at x=0, and all apples are at x>=1.\n\n2.  **Enemy Behavior Prediction**:\n    *   The apple at (2, 8) is only 3 moves away for the enemy, whereas (1, 1) is 5 moves away.\n    *   A rational enemy will likely go **UP** to secure the closest apple and position themselves for the top cluster ((4, 9), (8, 8)).\n\n3.  **My Strategy**:\n    *   If I go **UP**, I am in a race I am mathematically destined to lose (4 moves vs 3 moves). I would arrive 1 turn late, finding no apple and an enemy potentially blocking me.\n    *   If the enemy goes UP, the bottom apples ((1, 1) and (1, 0)) are left uncontested.\n    *   Going **DOWN** commits me to the bottom apples. Although it takes 6 moves, I am likely to get them without interference.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 6) would technically save 1 move towards the bottom, but it means moving into the cell currently occupied by the enemy head. Depending on specific collision resolution rules (whether the cell is cleared before or after collision checks), this carries a risk of immediate death. It also places me adjacent to the enemy, risking a head-on collision if they move Left/Down. Moving Down is safer.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   I will concede the top apples to the enemy to secure the bottom apples for myself. This split strategy avoids collision and guarantees points assuming the enemy plays logically.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nEnemy is closer to the top cluster of apples (starting with (2,8)). I cannot win the race to the top without the enemy ignoring the closest apple. The bottom cluster at (1,1) is slightly further but uncontested if the enemy goes Up. Moving Right to (1,6) risks collision logic. Moving Down initiates the path to the bottom apples safely.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

By staying in column 0, I maintain a horizontal separation from the enemy, reducing the risk of an accidental collision or aggressive block.\n\n2.  **Strategy**:\n    *   I will race the enemy to (1, 1). Since I am faster, I will arrive on Turn 5 and eat the apple.\n    *   Eating the apple gives me 1 point and grows my body.\n    *   If the enemy attempts to follow me into (1, 1) or (1, 0) after I eat, they will either collide with my newly grown body (and die) or we will have a head-on collision.

After taking the apple at (1, 1), I will move DOWN to (1, 0) to collect the second apple, securing a quick 2-point lead.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis:**\nI am currently at (0, 1) with an apple immediately to my right at (1, 1). Another apple lies just below that at (1, 0).\nThe enemy snake is at (0, 6), which is 5 moves away from my position and 6 moves away from my target apple at (1, 1). I have an uncontested speed advantage to these resources.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **RIGHT (1, 1)**: Moving here immediately consumes an apple, increasing my score to 1 and my length to 2. It places my head at (1, 1), adjacent to the second apple at (1, 0). This is the most efficient move.\n2.  **DOWN (0, 0)**: This is a safe square, but it delays eating the apples. I would have to move RIGHT then UP to get the apples, wasting 1 turn compared to moving RIGHT immediately.\n3.  **UP (0, 2)**: Moves away from the apples and back towards the enemy. Suboptimal.\n4.  **LEFT**: Wall (Out of bounds).\n\n**Plan:**\nI will execute the move **RIGHT** to eat the apple at (1, 1). On the next turn (Turn 6), I will move **DOWN** to (1, 0) to eat the second apple. Following that, I will likely exit to the right (2, 0) to avoid getting trapped in the corner and to head towards the center of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

It increases my score to 2 and secures a resource I am already adjacent to.\nMoving DOWN to (1, 0) is safe. My previous move was RIGHT (from 0,1 to 1,1), so DOWN is a 90-degree turn, not backwards. After eating, I will occupy (1, 0), (1, 1), and (0, 1).\n\n**Plan:**\nI will move **DOWN** to capture the apple at (1, 0).\nAfter this move, I will be at the bottom edge of the board. To avoid getting trapped in the corner (0,0) and to progress toward the next closest apple at (7, 3), I plan to move **RIGHT** to (2, 0) on the subsequent turn.
