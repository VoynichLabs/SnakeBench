Could be risky if enemy snake moves down or stays.\n\n- Moving LEFT to (0,4):  \n  - No apple, no snake, but doesn't move us closer to immediate apple goal.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,4):  \n  - No apple, no snake, not closer to apple at (1,5).\n\n- Moving DOWN to (1,3):  \n  - Already passed, could be risky (snake can't move backwards into its body, but our body is empty, so technically allowed but not beneficial).\n\nGiven the current state, moving UP to (1,5) to pick the apple is the best option. The enemy snake is just above at (1,6), but since their previous reported position was (1,6) with no body and our last information shows enemy at (1,6), they are probably not immediately threatening at (1,5) itself.\n\nStaying on track for the apple at (1,5) is critical for points and overall positioning.\n\nStrategy for next turns:  \nAfter grabbing the apple at (1,5), reassess enemy positions. Possibly shift towards apples at (7,8) or (8,4), which are safer and further away from the enemy snake at column 1. Also be wary of apple cluster near (8,2), (8,1), (8,4).\n\nNext move: UP"

Since we both have empty bodies, there's no immediate collision risk when I collect the apple at (1, 5) - I'll be 1 space away from the enemy.\n\nMy path is completely clear to move DOWN and collect the apple at (1, 5).\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I should consider my next strategy:\n1. The apple at (7, 8) will be a good next target since it's somewhat isolated\n2. I should be cautious of the enemy snake's movement and try to avoid getting trapped in the left column\n3. The cluster of apples on the right side (x=8) offers multiple options but they're further away\n\nStrategy for next turn: After collecting the apple at (1, 5), move RIGHT to start heading toward either (7, 8) or position myself better for the right-side apples. This will also create distance from the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN"
