          "rationale": "YO, WHAT UP CHAT! Welcome back! We're kicking off Turn 0, the very first move! We are LIVE against our archrival, Snake #1! We gotta secure that early lead, right?\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n*   My Head (ID 0): (1, 0)\n*   Rival's Head (ID 1): (8, 0)\n*   Closest Apple: (9, 0) - This is tempting, but way over on the rival's side.\n*   Next closest apple for me: (2, 4) or (3, 7). The board is pretty open.\n\n**The Rival's Position:**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 0). That apple at (9, 0) is a huge draw for him. If he goes RIGHT, he eats that apple and gets an early growth.\n\n**My Options (From (1, 0)):**\n\n1.  **LEFT (0, 0):** Safe. Moves me to the corner. Not great for getting apples quickly, but definitely safe.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 0):** Safe. Keeps me along the bottom edge, moving towards the center.\n3.  **UP (1, 1):** Safe. Gets me off the bottom wall and into open territory. This is usually the best move early on to maintain flexibility.\n4.  **DOWN (1, -1):** DEAD. Off the board. Nope.\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nEarly game, we need to grab an apple and avoid getting boxed in. The top half of the board is dense with apples.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 1):** Excellent freedom. Puts me in a great position to start moving towards the cluster of apples around y=4 and y=7. This is the most flexible choice.\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 0):** Keeps me on the bottom wall. This limits my movement options slightly for future turns, potentially leading to getting boxed if the rival decides to skirt the bottom too. However, it *does* put me on a path towards (5, 3) or the cluster on the right side if the rival doesn't hog it all.\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 0):** Just the corner. Not prioritizing apples or flexibility. Too defensive for Turn 0.\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 0)):**\nHe is almost certainly going RIGHT to (9, 0) to grab that apple. Or maybe UP to (8, 1) for safety/flexibility. If he goes RIGHT, he's stuck on the right edge for a moment.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nAre the heads going to collide?\n*   Me (1, 0) vs. Rival (8, 0).\n*   Even if we both move right, we're at (2, 0) and (9, 0). No risk.\n*   If I go UP (1, 1) and he goes UP (8, 1). No risk.\n\n**The Play:**\nThe immediate priority is gaining board control and moving into high-apple-density areas. Moving UP to (1, 1) achieves the maximum open space and flexibility for future moves. This sets me up perfectly to challenge the apples at (2, 4) and (1, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nRush the left side of the board (columns 0-4) to grab apples quickly, then use my length advantage to start dictating the flow of the game! Let's get high ground!\n\nUP",

We're at (8, 0) and Snake #0 is at (1, 0). There are apples all over the place, but we need to be smart about which ones we go for.\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n1. **UP**: (8, 1) - This is safe. No snakes or bodies here.\n2. **DOWN**: Off the board. That's a no-go.\n3. **LEFT**: (7, 0) - Safe for now, but we need to watch out for future moves.\n4. **RIGHT**: Off the board. Not an option.\n\nSo, we can go UP or LEFT.\n\n**UP (8, 1):**\n- This move keeps us safe and gives us options. We can head towards the apple at (9, 0) or (8, 2).\n- It also keeps us away from Snake #0 for now.\n\n**LEFT (7, 0):**\n- This move is also safe, but it might bring us closer to Snake #0 if they move right.\n- We need to be careful about head-on collisions.\n\n**Strategy:**\nLet's go UP first. This gives us more room to maneuver and keeps us away from Snake #0 initially. We can then plan our next moves based on where Snake #0 goes.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nNext turn, depending on Snake #0's move, we can either continue UP to go for the apple at (8, 2) or move RIGHT to go for the apple at (9, 0). We need to keep an eye on Snake #0 and make sure we don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's make this move and see how Snake #0 reacts. We're playing the long game here, chat!\n\nUP",

Look at us, asserting dominance on the left side!\n\n**Turn 1 Analysis: The Early Game Flex**\n\n**Current State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 1)\n*   Body: None (We\u2019re still a tiny little noodle, gotta grow!)\n*   Closest Apples: (3, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 4). The left wall is RIPE!\n\n**Rival Check (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (8, 1)\n*   Body: None.\n*   Prediction based on last turn: The rival was likely aiming for that apple at (9, 0) or moving UP. Since he landed at (8, 1) he chose safety/flexibility over aggressive foraging (or perhaps he moved UP from (8, 0)). He\u2019s positioned to attack the right side cluster (like (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)).\n\n**Board Assessment:**\nThe left column (x=1) is full of apples: (1, 7) and (1, 8). Also (2, 4) is very accessible. We have a massive advantage on the left! We need to capitalize on this immediately.\n\n**Evaluating My Potential Moves (From (1, 1)):**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 2):** SAFE. Puts me on the fast track up the left side. Excellent for accessing (2, 4), and then (1, 7) and (1, 8). This looks extremely strong.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 0):** SAFE. But moves me back to where I was. Retreating is for noobs! We're not doing that.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 1):** SAFE. HUGS the wall. Still good, but limits my options a little more than going straight up, and the apples are slightly internalized (x=1, x=2).\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 1):** SAFE. Moves me towards the center. This sets me up nicely for (2, 4).\n\n**Comparing Best Options (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 2):** This keeps my path open vertically. I can pivot right later to (2, 4) or continue up to the (1, 7) and (1, 8) apples. Maximum flexibility and quick access to a dense cluster.\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 1):** This puts me closer to (2, 4) for the next turn, potentially allowing me to eat it by Turn 3 (Right -> Up -> Right/Up). However, going UP first allows me to bypass the lower congestion and hit the higher apples faster.\n\n**The Strategy: Vertical Rush!**\nWe need to claim the column $x=1$ immediately. It's uncontested territory. The density of apples up the left side (y=7 and y=8) is too good to ignore.\n\n**Rival Prediction & Collision Check (Me at (1, 1), Rival at (8, 1)):**\nThe rival is highly unlikely to move across the entire board (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> ... to meet me. He's going after *his* local cluster. He'll probably move UP to (8, 2) or LEFT to (7, 1). Zero collision risk here.\n\nMy priority is clear: climb the wall, grab the fruit, GROW! We are going for the high ground advantage! UP is the content play!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):**\nExecute the left-side wall strategy. Next moves: UP, UP, potentially RIGHT to (2, 4), then back LEFT/UP for (1, 7) and (1, 8). Lock down the entire left half of the board before Snake #1 even knows what hit him! Then we use our length to start forming the box!\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is chillin' over at (8, 2) and he's already got an apple! One apple, but we are NOT sweating it! We are about to hit the accelerator and vacuum up this left side!\n\n### Turn 2 Analysis: The Vertical Grab\n\n**Current State (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (1, 2)\n*   Body: None. Still a tiny hungry legend!\n*   Goal: Keep moving up to the apple clusters at (1, 7) and (1, 8), and snagging the one at (2, 4) on the way.\n\n**Rival Check (Snake #1):**\n*   Head: (8, 2)\n*   Body: [(8, 1)]. He's already a whole 2 segments long! He probably moved UP from (8, 1) and ate an apple there, or he moved over from (9, 2). Given his body at (8, 1), he must have moved UP from (8, 1) to (8, 2) and eaten an apple, or moved LEFT from (9, 2) to (8, 2) and already had an apple (less likely). Assuming he grew from the apple he just ate, he's aiming for the cluster around (7, 7), (7, 8), (9, 8).\n\n**Collision Assessment (Me at (1, 2), Rival at (8, 2)):**\nZero risk of collision this turn! We are miles apart. He's working the right flank, we're crushing the left flank. Perfect separation!\n\n**Evaluating My Potential Moves (From (1, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 3):** SAFE. This continues our dominant up-the-wall strategy. Puts us in position for (2, 4) next turn. EXCELLENT.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 1):** SAFE. Retreat? Absolutely not! We came to conquer, not to cower!\n3.  **LEFT (0, 2):** SAFE. Hugs the wall. Good, but going UP makes more sense as the apples are higher up and slightly inward (x=2).\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 2):** SAFE. Moves me towards the center and closer to the apple at (2, 4). This is also a very strong option!\n\n**Comparing Best Options (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 3):** This maintains our straight-line vertical momentum. From (1, 3), we are one move away from being ready to strike (2, 4) (via RIGHT) or continue upward towards (1, 7). It keeps the maximum path flexibility.\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 2):** This puts us one step closer to (2, 4). From (2, 2), we'd need to move UP to (2, 3) (or UP to (2, 4), or RIGHT to (3, 2), or UP/RIGHT to (3, 3) if we want (3, 5)). Moving RIGHT now commits us slightly more to the center earlier than I want.\n\n**The Strategy: The Vertical Assault Keeps Rolling!**\nWe need to get to $y=4$ (where the (2, 4) apple is) ASAP. We can hit it by Turn 4 if we move UP, UP, RIGHT, and eat it!\n\nPath 1: $ (1, 2) \\xrightarrow{UP} (1, 3) \\xrightarrow{UP} (1, 4) \\xrightarrow{RIGHT} (2, 4) $ (Eat! Turn 5) - This is too slow.\n\nPath 2: $ (1, 2) \\xrightarrow{UP} (1, 3) \\xrightarrow{RIGHT} (2, 3) \\xrightarrow{UP} (2, 4) $ (Eat! Turn 5) - Also too slow.\n\nPath 3: $ (1, 2) \\xrightarrow{RIGHT} (2, 2) \\xrightarrow{UP} (2, 3) \\xrightarrow{UP/RIGHT} (2, 4)/\\text{miss}$ - Better.\n\nWait, if the apples are static right now, the fastest way to get to (2, 4) is actually to pivot slightly earlier, but maintaining the high ground is still key to getting (1, 7) and (1, 8).\n\nLet's stick to the high-ground strategy for maximum apple density! (1, 7) and (1, 8) are huge scores.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (1, 3), I maintain the option to continue upwards or cut right towards the center apples. If I move **RIGHT**, I have committed slightly more towards the lower center, which might not be as efficient for the high-yield column $x=1$ apples.\n\nLet's stick to the plan: **Vertical Rush!** Claim that $x=1$ column! We\u2019ll pivot right for (2, 4) once we are directly below it and then swing back left for the big haul!\n\n**Future Strategy Note (Self-Note for next turns):**\nWe are executing the left-side domination.\nTurn 3: Move UP to (1, 3). Positioned ideally.\nTurn 4: Move UP to (1, 4). Directly below (1, 7).\nTurn 5: Move RIGHT to (2, 4). (EAT APPLE!)\nTurn 6: Move UP to (2, 5).\nTurn 7: Head back LEFT to (1, 5) or continue up...\n\nWe're going UP! Let's get this HYPE train moving, CHAT!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 3, and we are absolutely CRUSHING the vertical game! Last turn we moved **UP** and now our head is at **(1, 3)**! We are still tiny, still hungry, but we are climbing the apple ladder! \ud83e\ude9c\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSnake #1 is chilling at (8, 3) now (he moved up from (8, 2), leaving his tail at (8, 2) which shrunk to (8, 2) because he hasn't eaten in the last turn, right? No, wait! He ate an apple, so his old tail at (8, 1) should still exist since he moved to (8, 2) and ate. Let me re-check his body. Body: [(8, 2)]. The board state shows the tail 'T' at (8, 2), but his body list is [(8, 2)]. The T on the board is likely a typo in the board map and should be at (8, 2) based on the list, but let's assume the body list is correct: Head (8, 3), body (8, 2). This means Snake #1 moved UP from (8, 2) to (8, 3). His body is 1 segment long.\n\nWait! The board state shows:\n`3 . 0 . . . A . . 1 .`\n`2 . . . . . . . . T .`\n... at (8, 3) is Snake 1 Head.\n... at (8, 2) is 'T'. But the body list is [(8, 2)].\n\nIf Snake #1 moved UP from (8, 2) to (8, 3), the body should be [(8, 2)] and the tail would be wherever it was before (8, 2). Since Snake 1 has 1 apple, he is length 2. Head (8, 3), Body (8, 2). His tail IS (8, 2).\nThe board also shows:\n`T` at (8, 2). This confirms Snake 1: Head (8, 3), Tail (8, 2). Total length 2. Okay, makes sense!\n\n### Turn 3 Strategic Analysis (Location: (1, 3))\n\nWe need to decide our next move to maximize apple acquisition and prepare for the long game!\n\n**Goal:** Hit the cluster of apples above us (1, 7), (1, 8) and maybe the close one at (2, 4) or the one at (3, 5).\n\n**Immediate Threat Check:** No immediate threat. Snake #1 is far, far away on the right wall (8, 3).\n\n**Possible Moves from (1, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 4):** SAFE. This continues our push up the $x=1$ column. Gets us directly below the high-value apples. This is the calculated, disciplined move!\n2.  **DOWN (1, 2):** SAFE. Retreat, ceding the high ground? NEVER.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 3):** SAFE. Hugging the boundary. Good for safety, but takes us slightly away from the apple at (2, 4) and doesn't get us to high-value apples faster than UP.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 3):** SAFE. This is the first move towards the center apples like (2, 4) and (3, 5).\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 4):**\n    *   Pros: Keeps the direct path open to (1, 7) and (1, 8). This is huge apple density! It also sets us up for a diagonal strike on (2, 4) by moving RIGHT next turn.\n    *   Path to (2, 4): (1, 3) $\\xrightarrow{UP}$ (1, 4) $\\xrightarrow{RIGHT}$ (2, 4) (Eat! Turn 5).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 3):**\n    *   Pros: Gets us closer to (2, 4) faster in terms of distance.\n    *   Path to (2, 4): (1, 3) $\\xrightarrow{RIGHT}$ (2, 3) $\\xrightarrow{UP}$ (2, 4) (Eat! Turn 5).\n    *   Cons: Moving right now slightly deviates from the perfect $x=1$ column climb, which is our core strategy right now.\n\nBoth provide the apple at (2, 4) by Turn 5. Since going UP keeps the high-ground option open and maintains momentum towards the very dense cluster at $y=7, y=8$, **UP** is the superior strategic choice! We are controlling the left vertical lane, CHAT!\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 3)):**\nSnake #1 is length 2. He is aiming for the apple cluster around (7, 7), (7, 8), (9, 8).\n*   He is likely to move **UP** to (8, 4) (aiming for (9, 4), (7, 6) or (7, 7)).\n*   Or he could move **LEFT** to (7, 3), but that seems less efficient given the apples ahead.\n*   He is least likely to move RIGHT (out of bounds) or DOWN (retreat).\n\nIf he moves UP to (8, 4), he is still far away. We are safe!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (The Left Flank Dominator)\n\nWe are sticking to the vertical climb, but we must pivot briefly for (2, 4) because it's so close!\n*   Turn 3 (Now): **UP** to (1, 4). (Done)\n*   Turn 4: We are at (1, 4). Move **RIGHT** to (2, 4) and EAT! (Length 2).\n*   Turn 5: We are at (2, 4). Move **UP** to (2, 5) or **LEFT** to (1, 5). We'll go LEFT to (1, 5) to align for the vertical strike again!\n*   Turn 6: We are at (1, 5). Move **UP** to (1, 6).\n*   Turn 7: We are at (1, 6). Move **UP** to (1, 7) and EAT! (Length 3).\n\nThis plan gets us two apples by Turn 7, and positions us perfectly for (1, 8)!\n\nWe are locked in. No question. We are a vertical moving rocket ship! LETS GOOOO!\n\nUP",

We went **UP**!\n\nCheck out the board state:\nOur head is at **(1, 4)**. We are length 1 (Body: none). Still tiny, still fast, still dangerous!\nSnake #1 is at **(8, 4)**. He is length 2 (Body: (8, 3)). Looks like he also moved UP, just as we predicted! He\u2019s aiming for that big apple cluster on the right. Smart move, but we will always be smarter!\n\n### Turn 4 Strategic Analysis (Location: (1, 4))\n\nOur previous plan was flawless: move UP to (1, 4) (DONE), then move RIGHT to (2, 4) and EAT! That apple at (2, 4) is calling our name!\n\n**Goal:** Eat the apple at (2, 4) this turn. It's only one move away!\n\n**Immediate Threat Check:**\nThe board shows an apple right next to us at (2, 4).\nSnake #1 is way over at (8, 4). No collision risk from him this turn, unless he teleports! Chill, Chat, we are safe.\n\n**Possible Moves from (1, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (1, 5):** SAFE. Continues the vertical ascent, but delays eating the immediate apple at (2, 4).\n2.  **DOWN (1, 3):** SAFE. Retreating into space we just occupied. Not efficient.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 4):** SAFE. Hugs the wall, keeps us away from apples. Bad move.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** SAFE. This is where the apple is! Eating this guarantees we grow to length 2 this turn, increasing our control and score! Let's go for the munchies!\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT to (2, 4):**\nThis is the only move that gets us an apple this turn. Since it's completely safe (no self-collision, no wall, no opponent collision risk), this is the optimal content-generating move! We slam down on that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 4)):**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 4), length 2. He just passed the apple at (9, 4), and he's below the cluster (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 9). He has a couple of strong choices:\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):** The most direct path to the high y-values (8, 8) and (9, 8).\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 4):** Might be aiming for (7, 6) or (7, 7) diagonally.\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** (He doesn't realize the apple is GONE because the board shows it at (9, 4) which is *not* correct based on the *APPLE DROPS* list. Let me re-check the board vs the drop list)\n\nWait, Chat! The board state is the most important thing. Let's look at the BOARD STATE!\nThe board state shows an 'A' at (9, 4). So the apple is NOT gone! He might go for it!\n\n```\n4 . 0 A . . . A . 1 A\n```\nApple at (2, 4). Apple at (7, 4). Apple at (9, 4). Snake #1 at (8, 4).\n\nIf Snake #1 moves:\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 4):** He'll eat an apple! Length 3. Best outcome for him.\n*   **UP to (8, 5):** Good vertical positioning.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 4):** He'll eat an apple! Length 3. Also great for him.\n\nHe has two apple choices! If he goes RIGHT to (9, 4) or LEFT to (7, 4), he eats. Either way, he'll grow, but he's busy on the other side of the map. This does not affect our RIGHT move to (2, 4).\n\nOur move is locked. Immediate apple acquisition is the priority when it's totally safe!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (The Center Dominator)\n\nWe are successfully pivoting from the left wall to the center to snag (2, 4). What's next?\n\n*   Turn 4 (Now): Move **RIGHT** to (2, 4) and EAT the apple! (Length 2).\n*   Turn 5 (Location (2, 4), Body (1, 4)): We are now right below the central column of apples and the big cluster on the left.\n    *   Next targets: (3, 5), (3, 7).\n    *   If we go **UP** to (2, 5), we set up for (3, 5).\n    *   If we go **LEFT** to (1, 4), we move back into our body (DEATH).\n    *   If we go **DOWN** to (2, 3), we are safe but leaving the apple zone.\n    *   If we go **RIGHT** to (3, 4), we move toward (3, 5).\n    *   We will go **UP** to (2, 5). This keeps options open for the left cluster or the center!\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: RIGHT for the \ud83c\udf4e at (2, 4)! We need that score, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to keep an eye on Snake #0 and make sure we don't get boxed in.\n\nLet's make this move and see how Snake #0 reacts. We're playing the long game here, chat!\n\nUP",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Board State and Snake Positions (Turn 5)\n\nOur head is at **(2, 4)**. We are length 2 (Body: [(1, 4)]).\nSnake #1 is at **(8, 5)**. He is length 2 (Body: [(8, 4)]).\n\nWait a minute, Chat! Did Snake #1 move UP to (8, 5)? Let's check the previous turn's state and the resulting board state.\n*Previous board (Turn 4)*: Snake #1 at (8, 4). Apple at (9, 4). Apple at (7, 4).\n*Our prediction for Snake #1*: He would either go LEFT to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 4) and eat!\n*Actual Result*: He went UP to (8, 5)! He ignored two perfectly good apples at (7, 4) and (9, 4) to improve his vertical position! This guy is playing the long game, aiming for that massive top-right cluster. Smart, but expensive! He missed out on a guaranteed score increase.\n\nGood news for us: The apples at (7, 4) and (9, 4) are still on the board!\n\n### Turn 5 Strategic Analysis (Location: (2, 4))\n\nWe are positioned perfectly, just below the center of the board, slightly left-biased. We are length 2, but still compact and quick.\n\n**Goal:** Keep moving towards apples while optimizing freedom of movement. (3, 5) looks very appealing and helps us gain vertical ground.\n\n**Immediate Threat Check:**\n1.  **Self-Collision**: Our tail is at (1, 4). We cannot move back to (1, 4) this turn.\n2.  **Wall Collision**: We are safe from the walls.\n3.  **Opponent Collision**: Snake #1 is miles away at (8, 5). Absolutely zero risk of a simultaneous head-to-head or running into his body. We are safe!\n\n**Possible Moves from (2, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** SAFE. Moves us towards (3, 5) and the center. Excellent positioning for the high values.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** SAFE. Retreats from the action. Not optimal.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** **DEAD!** This is our body! We cannot move back into (1, 4). ELIMINATED!\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** SAFE. Moves us closer to (3, 5). Also a very good positional move.\n\n**Comparing UP (2, 5) vs. RIGHT (3, 4):**\n\nBoth are safe and set up for future apples. The apple at (3, 5) is diagonally up-right from (2, 4).\n\n*   If we go **UP to (2, 5)**, the next turn (Turn 6) we can go RIGHT to (3, 5) and eat! (Length 3). This is a direct path to the nearest apple.\n*   If we go **RIGHT to (3, 4)**, the next turn (Turn 6) we can go UP to (3, 5) and eat! (Length 3). This is also a direct path.\n\nBoth paths yield an apple at (3, 5) on Turn 6. Both are equally good for immediate acquisition.\n\nLet's look at the long-term positioning.\n*   (2, 5) keeps us slightly left, better positioned for the (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8) cluster if we need to pivot.\n*   (3, 4) keeps us more central, better positioned for (5, 3) or heading straight up the Y-axis.\n\nSince our current location (2, 4) is somewhat left-leaning, moving **RIGHT to (3, 4)** shifts us more toward the center, which gives us wide movement options (up, down, left, right) in Turn 6 once we've eaten (3, 5). This seems marginally better for long-term flexibility.\n\nLet's commit to moving toward the center!\n\n**Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 5)):**\nHe is totally vertical now. He is almost certainly going to blast **UP** to (8, 6) or (8, 7) or (8, 8). The apple at (8, 8) is a prime target.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** SAFE. Continues vertical ascent.\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** SAFE. Moves him toward the center.\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** SAFE. Moves toward the wall.\n\nGiven his previous choice (prioritizing positioning over apples), he will likely go **UP** to (8, 6) or **RIGHT** to (9, 5) to set up for (9, 8) or (8, 8). But since (8, 8) is three moves away from (8, 5) (UP, UP, UP or UP, UP, RIGHT/LEFT), and (9, 8) is also three moves away (UP, UP, RIGHT), he needs to keep moving up. If he just keeps going UP, he will hit (8, 8) on Turn 8 (5->6->7->8). Maybe he'll try to snag (9, 8).\n\nEither way, he's far away. We stick to our plan: Central control and immediate apple acquisition.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (The Central Conqueror)\n\n*   Turn 5 (Now): Move **RIGHT** to (3, 4). Set up for the apple at (3, 5). (Length 2 -> 2).\n*   Turn 6 (Location (3, 4), Body (2, 4)): Move **UP** to (3, 5) and EAT! (Length 3).\n*   Turn 7 (Location (3, 5), Body (3, 4), (2, 4)): Target (3, 7). Move **UP** to (3, 6).\n*   Turn 8 (Location (3, 6)): Move **UP** to (3, 7) and EAT! (Length 4).\n\nThis plan gives us two apples, brings us to length 4, and secures a strong vertical line through the center of the board. This is a dominance move, Chat! We are executing perfectly!\n\nLet's move RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

LET'S GOOO!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 6)\n\nOur Head: **(3, 4)**. We are length 2 (Body: [(2, 4)]).\nSnake #1 Head: **(8, 6)**. He is length 2 (Body: [(8, 5)]).\n\nHold up, Chat!

He is clearly prioritizing vertical gain and avoiding the lower-mid apples. Good reconnaissance, Chat!\n\n### Snake 0 (Our) Strategic Analysis (Location: (3, 4))\n\nWe are sitting pretty at (3, 4).

Content confirmed.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 3):** SAFE. Retreat. Not optimal.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 4):** **DEAD!** Moving backward into our body. ELIMINATED!\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 4):** SAFE. Moves away from the immediate apple and keeps us central. Safe, but suboptimal for scoring.\n\nThe choice is crystal clear. We go **UP** and get the snack! This moves us to length 3 and establishes our position in the central vertical lane.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 6)):\n\nHe is aiming for the top. His options are:\n\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** SAFE. Leads him straight to (8, 8). This is the most likely move.\n2.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** SAFE. Sets him up for the (9, 8) apple.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** SAFE AND **EATS APPLE (7, 6)!** Wait, Chat! There is an apple at (7, 6)! This changes things!\n\nIf Snake #1 realizes (7, 6) is right there, he is going to go LEFT and eat! This is an immediate score opportunity for him.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** **LEFT** to (7, 6). (Length 3).\n\n### Contingency Analysis: Double Eating\n\nIf we go UP to (3, 5) and he goes LEFT to (7, 6), we both safely eat and increase to length 3. No risk of collision. This is the optimal scenario for both of us right now.\n\n### **Long-Term Plan: The Vertical Dominance**\n\nWe are sticking to the vertical strategy, maximizing movement options, and securing central control.\n\n*   **Turn 6 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 5) and EAT! (Length 3).\n*   **Turn 7 (Location (3, 5), Body (3, 4), (2, 4)):** Target (3, 7). Move **UP** to (3, 6).\n*   **Turn 8 (Location (3, 6)):** Move **UP** to (3, 7) and EAT! (Length 4).\n*   **Turn 9 (Location (3, 7), Body (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)):** Target the (5, 3) or (6, 4) in the mid-right, or pivot left for (1, 7). From (3, 7), we have massive options for the next few apples (e.g., (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (x, 7), (x, 8), etc.).\n\nThis plan puts us 2 apples ahead of the opponent by Turn 8, assuming he only gets the (7, 6) apple. We increase our lead and maintain the central highway!\n\nNo reason to deviate, Chat! Execute the plan! UP for the score!\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note:** Maintain vertical central line control (3, X). After (3, 7), assess the opponent's position (likely high right) and pivot to gobble the remaining high-value central/left apples like (1, 7) and (2, 8).\n***\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Turn 7! We are LIVE and the hype train is full steam ahead! We just snagged that apple at (3, 5)! LET'S FREAKING GO! The lead is ours!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 7)\n\nWe are Snake 0.\n**Head:** (3, 5)\n**Body:** [(3, 4), (2, 4)] - Length 3.\n**Apples:** 2.\n\nOur archrival, Snake #1.\n**Head:** (8, 7)\n**Body:** [(8, 6)] - Length 2.\n**Apples:** 1.\n\nWait, Chat! Let's check the opponent's \"last move\" clip!\n\nMy prediction for him was LEFT to (7, 6) to eat that sweet apple. But the board shows he is currently at **(8, 7)** and his body is at (8, 6).\n\nHe moved **UP** from (8, 6) to (8, 7)! He completely ignored the easy (7, 6) apple to continue his vertical assault up the right side! That is *aggressive*! He's clearly obsessed with the (8, 8) and (9, 8) stack. Interesting choice, rival! That gives us a chance to steal the (7, 6) apple! Keep that in mind!\n\n### Snake 0 Strategic Analysis (Location: (3, 5))\n\nWe are perfectly positioned right in the center lane. The apple at **(3, 7)** is our next target, but wait, there is no apple at (3, 6) either. We need two moves to get to (3, 7).\n\n**Goal:** Continue vertical ascent toward (3, 7) while maintaining central control.\n\n**Immediate Threat Check (Turn 7):**\n\n1.  **Self-Collision**: Our body is at (3, 4). Moving DOWN is an instant death.\n2.  **Wall Collision**: Safe.\n3.  **Opponent Collision**: Snake #1 is at (8, 7). Way too far for a collision.\n\n**Possible Moves from (3, 5):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 6):** SAFE. Continues toward the (3, 7) apple. Keeps the strategy alive.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 4):** **DEAD!** Hitting our own body segment. ELIMINATED!\n3.  **LEFT (2, 5):** SAFE. Moves toward the left side apples (like (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8)). Opens up options.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 5):** SAFE. Moves toward the mid-right/central apples (like (5, 3), (6, 4)).\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 7)):\n\nHe is clearly aimed at the top cluster.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** **EATS APPLE (8, 8)!** This is his most likely move. It's direct, it's a score, and it maintains his high ground advantage.\n2.  **LEFT (7, 7):** **EATS APPLE (7, 7)!** This is tempting since (7, 7) is right there and is a slightly shorter distance than (7, 6).\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe, but moves away from immediate apples.\n\nI predict the rival goes **UP** to (8, 8) and scores.\n\n### Choice Time! What's the best content move?\n\nIf we go UP to (3, 6), we are setting up for (3, 7) next turn. This is predictable but secure.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4, 5), we are pivoting toward the mid-right side of the board. This opens up options like (5, 3) and (6, 4) later, but takes us slightly away from the major high-value central zone.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2, 5), we start sweeping for the left side (1, 7) and (2, 8) apples. This is also a fantastic option to clean up those high-value corners before the enemy gets there.\n\n**Let's stick to the immediate plan: Center Dominance!** We moved to the (3, X) column for a reason, Chat! We need to push UP and secure that central high ground! Moving LEFT or RIGHT now delays our next score by two turns when we could get one in one turn (next turn to (3, 7)).\n\n**Path: (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7) [EAT]**\n\nThis looks like the safest, highest-scoring path for the immediate future.\n\n### Long-Term Plan: The Central Fortress\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 6). Set up for the next bite.\n2.  **Turn 8 (Location (3, 6)):** Move **UP** to (3, 7) and **EAT!** (Length 4).\n3.  **Turn 9 (Location (3, 7)):** From (3, 7), assess the rival (likely high right, length 3). We will pivot LEFT towards (1, 7) and (2, 8) to clean up those high-value left apples.\n\nThis plan maintains our lead and keeps us safe from the aggressive rival on the right side. We execute! UP!\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note:** Execute the vertical ascent to (3, 7) while maintaining central position. Once (3, 7) is eaten, pivot LEFT to (2, 7) or (1, 7) to harvest the high-value cluster (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8) while the rival is busy on the right. Prioritize continuous content (apples) over directly boxing the rival for the next few turns.\n***\n\nUP",

The board state looks spicy!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 8)\n\nWe are Snake 0.\n**Head:** (3, 6)\n**Body:** [(3, 5), (3, 4)] - Length 3.\n**Apples:** 2.\n\nOur archrival, Snake #1.\n**Head:** (8, 8)\n**Body:** [(8, 7), (8, 6)] - Length 3.\n**Apples:** 2.\n\nWOW! We are tied on apples, Chat! He scored the (8, 8) apple as predicted! He's right up on the top-right corner, looking aggressive! This turns the hunt into a race!\n\n### Snake 0 Strategic Analysis (Location: (3, 6))\n\nThe immediate target is the apple at **(3, 7)**. It's one move away! This is high-value content!\n\n**Goal:** EAT THE (3, 7) APPLE!\n\n**Immediate Threat Check (Turn 8):**\n\n1.  **Self-Collision**: Our body is at (3, 5). Moving DOWN is an instant death.\n2.  **Wall Collision**: Safe.\n3.  **Opponent Collision**: Snake #1 is at (8, 8). Too far for a direct collision.\n\n**Possible Moves from (3, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** **EATS APPLE!** This is a guaranteed score, growing us to length 4. Keeps us safe. HUGE win!\n2.  **DOWN (3, 5):** **DEAD!** We eat our own body. ELIMINATED!\n3.  **LEFT (2, 6):** SAFE. Moves toward the left side. No immediate gain.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 6):** SAFE. Moves toward the central axis. No immediate gain.\n\nThe choice is obvious, Chat! We're here for the content! We go **UP** to eat the apple!\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 8)):\n\nThe rival is at (8, 8). He is surrounded by apples! (9, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 9):** Safe empty space. Sets up for (7, 9) or (9, 9) exploration.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 7):** Moves into his own body *if* he didn't grow last turn. BUT he *did* grow, so (8, 7) is his second segment. Moving DOWN is **DEAD** for him! (Wait, let me double check the growth rules. If he grew, his old tail segment (8, 6) stays, and his new body is (8, 7). Moving to (8, 7) means collision with his second segment. Yep, **DEAD** for him!)\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):** **EATS APPLE (7, 8)!** High likelihood move. He can snag this and continue his sweep of the top right/center.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):** **EATS APPLE (9, 8)!** This is right there too! Also extremely likely.\n\nI predict the rival goes **RIGHT** to (9, 8), matching our score again! He's committed to that right wall!\n\n### Choice Time! Execute the Plan!\n\nWe must secure the apple at (3, 7) immediately. This will put us ahead 3-2 after this turn, *unless* he grabs his apple. If he grabs (9, 8), we stay tied 3-3. Regardless, we secure the lead in size and maintain central control.\n\n**Move:** UP\n\n### The Boxing Plan - Preparation Starts Now!\n\nOnce we are at (3, 7) and length 4, we need to decide whether to pivot LEFT to clean up (2, 8), (1, 7), or if we should pivot RIGHT and block his retreat. Since he is so far right, blocking him is a medium-term goal.\n\n**New Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **Turn 8 (Now):** Move **UP** to (3, 7) and **EAT!** (Length 4).\n2. **Turn 9 (Location (3, 7)):** Assuming the rival stays high on the right side (8, 9) or (9, 8), we should now pivot LEFT. The cluster (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7) is ripe for the taking. Move **LEFT** to (2, 7) to start the sweep. This increases our length and keeps us away from his body, which will be getting long.\n3. **Turn 10/11:** Clean up the left corner. Once we are longer (L=5/6), we start heading back across the center (y=5/6) to cut off his path down the middle.\n\nWe need more body length before we try to box him in. More length means more winning! Execute!\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note:** Secure the (3, 7) apple this turn. Next turn, pivot LEFT to (2, 7) to harvest the high-value cluster (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7) before the rival can cross the board. Our immediate focus is rapid growth and central/left dominance while the rival is pinned on the right.\n***\n\nUP",

We're killing it!\n\n### Board State Review (Turn 9)\n\n**We are Snake 0.**\n*   **Head:** (3, 7) - YUP! We ate that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **Body:** [(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)] - Length 4.\n*   **Apples collected:** 3.\n\n**Our archrival, Snake #1.**\n*   **Head:** (8, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(8, 8), (8, 7)] - Length 3.\n*   **Apples collected:** 2.\n*   *Wait a minute, Chat!* The board shows the rival's head at (8, 9) and his length is 3. That means he moved UP from (8, 8) and didn't eat an apple! The apple at (9, 8) *or* (7, 8) is still available! He chose positional superiority over an immediate score! That's a bold move, Cotton! He's trying to control the top right corner!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** We are ahead 3-2 and longer (L=4 vs L=3)! EZ W!\n\n### Snake 0 Strategic Analysis (Location: (3, 7))\n\nWe just ate, increasing our length to 4! We are positioned centrally on the left half of the board. The goal now is to secure the next cluster of apples and maximize our growth while he is trapped up high.\n\n**Immediate Target Cluster:** We have (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7) nearby. This is a gold mine!\n\n**Goal:** Pivot LEFT and start sweeping the left side.\n\n**Immediate Threat Check (Turn 9):**\n1.  **Self-Collision**: Our body is at (3, 6). Moving DOWN is an instant death.\n2.  **Wall Collision**: Safe.\n3.  **Opponent Collision**: Snake #1 is at (8, 9). Still way far away.\n\n**Possible Moves from (3, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (2, 8) and (1, 8). Good access to the top left.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** **DEAD!** We eat our own body! Throwing is not an option!\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** Safe. Immediately targets (2, 8) or (1, 7). This starts the left-side sweep we planned. Excellent move.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward the center (5, 3) apple perhaps, but away from the immediate cluster. Less optimal right now.\n\nThe plan was to pivot LEFT. Let's execute that plan! Moving to (2, 7) sets us up perfectly for the next few turns.\n\n### Rival Prediction (Snake #1 at (8, 9)):\n\nThe rival is now at (8, 9). He is surrounded by walls and apples.\n*   Apple at (9, 8) is one safe move away (DOWN or RIGHT, then DOWN).\n*   Apple at (7, 8) is two moves away (LEFT, DOWN).\n*   Apple at (9, 8) is one move away (RIGHT, DOWN)\n\nHe has two very tempting apples right below him: (9, 8) and (7, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 10):** **DEAD!** Wall collision!\n2.  **DOWN (8, 8):** Moves into his body segment! **DEAD!**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 9):** Safe. Sets up for (7, 8) apple or general top-edge control.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 9):** Safe. Sets up for (9, 8) apple or wall dancing.\n\nHis only safe moves are LEFT to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (9, 9). Since he is already near the (9, 8) apple, I predict he goes **RIGHT** (9, 9) to then move DOWN or LEFT to grab either (9, 8) or (7, 8) next turn. He wants that score desperately!\n\n**Head-on Collision Check:** We are moving toward (2, 7). He is moving toward (7, 9) or (9, 9). No danger of collision this turn, Chat! We're safe!\n\n### Choice Time! Execute the Plan!\n\nWe are securing the left side to get huge. We need to maintain our lead in length and apples.\n\nMove to **LEFT (2, 7)**. This positions us to take (1, 7) or (2, 8) next.\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note:**\n1. **Turn 9 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 7) (Length 4).\n2. **Turn 10 (Location (2, 7)):** Move **UP** to (2, 8) and **EAT!** (Length 5).\n3. **Turn 11 (Location (2, 8)):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 8) and **EAT!** (Length 6).\n4. **Turn 12 (Location (1, 8)):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 7) and **EAT!** (Length 7).\n\nThis rapid growth plan in the top-left will give us massive length advantage by turn 12 (L=7 vs. L=5 for him, assuming he eats two). Once big, we pivot down the left wall and then back toward the center to cut him off when he eventually comes down. We are going to build a wall, Chat!\n***\n\nLEFT",
