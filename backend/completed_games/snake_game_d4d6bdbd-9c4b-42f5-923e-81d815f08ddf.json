It's safe this turn (no enemy head can reach (3,5) this move).\n- UP or DOWN keep more local space but don't advance toward the nearest apple and are less efficient for contesting the left apple cluster.\n- Enemy head (7,3) is far and cannot contest the immediate cells I'm considering this turn.\n\nShort plan:\n- Continue LEFT next turn to take (2,5). After eating, pivot west/south to the (0,6)/(0,4) cluster while avoiding getting boxed in by my own body in the northeast. Keep routes open toward the west edge and avoid tight loops.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy at (3,5) cannot reach any of (6,4), (6,2), or (5,3) this turn, and none of their legal moves creates a head-on with us.\n\nGiven we’re tied on apples and the enemy dominates the upper-middle of the board, it’s better to maximize separation and secure the large, empty lower-left region where future apples may spawn, rather than pushing toward the center right now. Moving DOWN increases distance from the enemy, keeps three safe exits next turn (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), and avoids weaving closer to their coil.\n\nStrategy note to future self (next few turns):\n- Continue generally DOWN/LEFT into the lower-left quadrant (y ≈ 1–3, x decreasing), staying out of the enemy’s central/upper lanes.\n- Avoid threading back into our right-side coil; let the tail fully unwind from the top-right while we sweep along the bottom.\n- Only contest central/left apples (like near columns 0–2) if we can approach from below with clear escape routes and minimal head-on risk.\n\nDOWN",
