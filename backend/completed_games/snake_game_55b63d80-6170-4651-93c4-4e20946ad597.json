I just grew by eating the apple above.\n\n\u2022 Looking at the board, several apples remain: one at (9,8), one at (9,0), one at (7,3), one at (2,3), and one at (4,0).\n\n\u2022 The apple at (2,3) is very tempting\u2014it\u2019s almost adjacent to my tail. Although I can\u2019t go directly downward since (3,3) is occupied by my body, I can maneuver toward (2,3).\n\n\u2022 From my head at (3,4), if I move LEFT, I\u2019ll arrive at (2,4). That cell is free, and it positions me one column over from the (2,3) apple. On my following move, I could then move DOWN to collect it.\n\n\u2022 There are no immediate hazards from walls or enemy snake segments nearby\u2014the enemy\u2019s head is at (1,6) with bodies at (2,6) and (3,6), which are far from my planned route.\n\nThus, targeting the apple at (2,3) seems a safe and beneficial strategy.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
