I should stay away from (6, 9), which is where Snake #2 is currently located. I\u2019ll focus initially on apples that Snake #2 is further from.\n   \n2. **Target Apples:** Based on my position (0, 4), the apple at (3, 2) seems the most accessible, while also being farther from Snake #2, minimizing immediate confrontation.\n   \n3. **Path Consideration:** To safely reach (3, 2), I'll need to move right towards column 3 and then down to row 2.\n\n### Next Move:\n- To start heading towards (3, 2), I will first move **RIGHT** to (1, 4).\n\nMy next move is **RIGHT**."
