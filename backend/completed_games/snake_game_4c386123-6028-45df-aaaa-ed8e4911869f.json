Possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 1)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, -1) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 0)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 0)  \n\n**2. Eliminate deadly moves**  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- UP: (3, 1) is empty.  \n- LEFT: (2, 0) is empty.  \n- RIGHT: (4, 0) is empty.  \nNo snake bodies yet, so no self-collision possible.  \n\n**3. Enemy snake positions and possible moves**  \nSnake #0 head at (6, 7). Possible moves: UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7).  \nNone of those overlap with my possible moves this turn, so no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**4. Apples**  \nApples at: (4,5), (2,9), (0,4), (7,9), (0,1).  \nClosest apple to me:  \n- (0,1) \u2192 Manhattan distance = |3-0| + |0-1| = 3+1=4  \n- (0,4) \u2192 distance = 3+4=7  \n- (4,5) \u2192 distance = 1+5=6  \n- (2,9) and (7,9) far away.  \n\nClosest is (0,1).  \n\n**5. Which moves go toward (0,1)?**  \nFrom (3,0):  \n- LEFT (2,0) \u2192 distance to (0,1) = 2+1=3 (better than 4)  \n- UP (3,1) \u2192 distance = 3+0=3 (same improvement)  \n- RIGHT (4,0) \u2192 distance = 4+1=5 (worse)  \n\nSo UP or LEFT are equally good for approaching (0,1).  \n\n**6. Future mobility**  \nFrom (3,1): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all likely safe unless enemy moves there).  \nFrom (2,0): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (similar).  \n\nBut (2,0) is closer to the left edge; (3,1) is more central. Being central is better for flexibility long-term.  \n\nAlso, apple at (0,1) is up-left from me. Going LEFT now gets me closer to left wall, but I\u2019ll need to go UP later anyway. Going UP first keeps options open.  \n\n**7. Decision**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe. UP feels slightly better because it moves me away from the bottom edge (where DOWN is blocked) and gives more space.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turns**:  \nHead toward apple at (0,1) via path that avoids likely enemy paths. Snake #0 is far away now, so focus on collecting apples while keeping space to maneuver.  \n\n**Final move**:  \nUP",

Eliminate deadly moves**  \n- UP: (1, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN: (1, 0) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT: (0, 1) \u2014 has an apple, no snake body.  \n- RIGHT: (2, 1) \u2014 empty.  \nAll moves are safe.  \n\n**3. Enemy snake position**  \nSnake #0 head at (4, 6). Possible moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6).  \nNone overlap with my possible moves this turn, so no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n**4. Apples**  \nApples at: (4,5), (2,9), (0,4), (7,9), (0,1).  \nClosest apple to me:  \n- (0,1) \u2192 distance = |1-0| + |1-1| = 1+0 = 1 (LEFT)  \n- (0,4) \u2192 distance = 1+3=4  \nOthers are far.  \n\n**5. Which moves go toward (0,1)?**  \nFrom (1,1):  \n- LEFT (0,1) \u2192 directly eats apple \u2192 distance 0 after move.  \nOther moves increase distance or keep it same.  \n\n**6. Future mobility after eating apple**  \nIf I eat apple at (0,1), my body will grow by 1 segment. My tail is currently nonexistent (length 1), so after eating, length becomes 2. Next turn my head will be at (0,1) and my body at (1,1). From (0,1), possible moves: UP (0,2), DOWN (0,0), RIGHT (1,1) \u2014 but RIGHT would hit my own body next turn if I eat now. So after eating, I\u2019ll have only UP and DOWN available. That\u2019s a bit risky because I\u2019ll be along the left edge.  \n\n**7. Risk assessment**  \nEating apple now is safe this turn, but next turn I\u2019ll be restricted. Snake #0 is far away, so maybe it\u2019s okay. But maybe it\u2019s better to delay eating by 1 turn to keep more options open? Let\u2019s check:  \n\nIf I go UP to (1,2) this turn instead:  \n- Distance to (0,1) becomes 1+1=2 (worse), but I can then go LEFT to (0,2) and then DOWN to (0,1) to eat apple later while avoiding trapping myself. This gives more flexibility.  \n\n**8. Decision**  \nLEFT is safe and gets the apple immediately, but slightly limits next turn\u2019s moves. However, since the board is mostly empty and enemy far, it\u2019s probably fine. The main goal is to eat apples safely.  \n\n**Short-term plan**:  \nEat apple at (0,1) now with LEFT. Next turn from (0,1), go UP or DOWN to avoid trapping myself. Keep an eye on Snake #0\u2019s movement toward other apples.  \n\nLEFT",

Not direct overlap this turn.  \n\n**3. Apples**  \nApples at: (2, 9), (0, 4), (7, 9), (8, 3), (3, 1).  \nClosest apple to (1,2):  \n- (0, 4): distance = |0-1| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3  \n- (3, 1): distance = |3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3  \nBoth equally close in Manhattan distance.  \n\nBut (3,1) is closer if I move RIGHT then DOWN later. (0,4) is closer if I go LEFT then UP later \u2014 but LEFT is blocked now. So UP gets me closer to (0,4) but not directly reachable without going left first later.  \n\n**4. Future mobility**  \nFrom (1,3): moves next turn: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2) \u2192 body?, LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3) \u2014 3 safe moves likely.  \nFrom (1,1): moves next turn: UP (1,2) \u2192 body?, DOWN (1,0), LEFT (0,1), RIGHT (2,1) \u2014 3 safe moves likely.  \nFrom (2,2): moves next turn: UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1), LEFT (1,2) \u2192 body?, RIGHT (3,2) \u2014 3 safe moves likely.  \n\nAll have similar mobility next turn.  \n\n**5. Avoiding dead ends**  \nBoard edges: UP and DOWN keep me near edge but not trapped yet. RIGHT moves me more central, better for long-term options.  \n\n**6. Enemy movement prediction**  \nSnake #0 may go DOWN (3,3) or LEFT (2,4) or RIGHT (4,4). If it goes LEFT to (2,4), then next turn it could threaten (2,3) if I go UP now to (1,3) then RIGHT to (2,3).

Apples**  \nApples: (2,9), (0,4), (7,9), (8,3), (3,1).  \nClosest apple to (2,1): (3,1) \u2192 distance 2 (RIGHT then UP next turn), but RIGHT is risky due to possible head-on collision.  \n(0,4) is far, (3,1) is closest but risky.  \n\n**4. Avoiding head-on collision**  \nRIGHT to (3,1) risks collision if Snake #0 goes DOWN to (3,1).  \nLEFT to (1,1) is safe from head-on collision this turn.  \nDOWN to (2,0) is safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**5. Future mobility**  \nFrom (2,0): moves next turn: UP (2,1) \u2192 body?, DOWN (2,-1) off board \u2192 invalid, LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0) \u2014 only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \nFrom (1,1): moves next turn: UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0), LEFT (0,1), RIGHT (2,1) \u2014 4 safe moves likely (all free except maybe enemy moves).  \n\nLEFT gives more future mobility than DOWN.  \n\n**6. Risk assessment**  \nLEFT seems safest and keeps options open. RIGHT is too risky due to potential head-on collision.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1,1), consider moving toward apple (0,4) or (3,1) depending on enemy position next turn. Avoid moving into enemy head\u2019s possible path.  \n\nLEFT",

Future mobility analysis**  \n- LEFT (0, 4) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 3. Next turn head at (0,4), body: [(1,4), (1,3)]. Possible moves: UP (0,5), DOWN (0,3), RIGHT (1,4) body? Actually body will be [(1,4), (1,3)], so (1,4) is body next turn \u2192 so RIGHT invalid. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn \u2014 risky.  \n- UP (1, 5) \u2192 free.

Better to keep mobility high unless apple is critical.\n\nSince I have 1 apple and enemy has 2, catching up is important but survival is more important. UP keeps options open and I can still get (0,4) next turn if safe.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (1,5), assess if enemy is moving toward (0,4). If not, go LEFT then DOWN to grab apple safely while keeping escape routes.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a strong incentive.  \n\n**Future mobility check after each move:**  \n- UP (4, 9): eat apple \u2192 body extends to [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)] but head at (4, 9).

Eating apple at (4, 9) is safe this turn, but next turn I\u2019ll have only 2 escape routes from (4, 9). That\u2019s a bit risky if enemy approaches top row later.  \n\nHowever, growing now helps me catch up in apples (enemy has 4, I have 2). The board has apples at (2, 9) and (7, 9) near top row, so after eating (4, 9), I could go LEFT toward (2, 9) or RIGHT toward (7, 9) depending on enemy movement.  \n\nGiven the win condition (first to 30 apples), early growth is good if it doesn\u2019t trap me.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (4, 9), check enemy movement: if enemy moves toward top, go the opposite direction along top row to another apple. Avoid being cornered.  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple now for growth.  \n\nUP",

This would give me my 5th apple! \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN** - Would move to (7, 7)\n   - Safe: (7, 7) is currently unoccupied\n   - Would move away from the concentration of apples in the top rows\n\n3. **LEFT** - Would move to (6, 8)\n   - **DEADLY**: I would run into my own body segment at (6, 8) \u274c\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Would move to (8, 8)\n   - Safe: (8, 8) is currently empty\n   - Keeps me in the upper-right area with access to more apples\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I now have a clear opportunity to eat the apple at (7, 9) by moving UP\n- This would extend my lead to 5 apples vs enemy's 3 apples\n- Enemy snake is at (5, 8), which is relatively close but they can't reach (7, 9) before me\n- After eating this apple, I'll need to plan an escape route from the top edge\n- The enemy snake appears to be maneuvering and might be targeting the apple at (2, 9)\n\n**Decision:** UP - This immediately collects the apple at (7, 9), extending my lead and growing my snake. This is the most strategically sound move as it directly gains points while keeping me safe.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:** After collecting the apple at (7, 9), I'll need to escape from the top edge. I should consider moving LEFT toward (6, 9) or RIGHT toward (8, 9), or potentially DOWN if available, to avoid getting trapped on the edge.\n\nUP",

After moving there, I'll need to assess enemy position next turn. I should try to maneuver toward the (9, 7) or (3, 0) apples while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is longer and has more apples, so I need to be cautious about head-on collisions.\n\n**Next turn strategy:** From (5, 7), prioritize moves that keep me away from the enemy's likely path while heading toward apples. The enemy might go for (7, 9) apple this turn, putting them at (7, 9) next turn. That means they'll be far from me, giving me space to plan a route to (9, 7) or (3, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Immediate head-on collision only if we choose the same cell this turn, impossible here since enemy can't reach cells I can reach in one move from (8,2) vs (4,2).  \n\nSo all safe moves seem collision-free this turn.  \n\n**Apple strategy:**  \n\nBest scoring opportunity: (4,3) apple is 1 move away (UP). Eating it increases my length, still safe if enemy not also targeting it.  \nEnemy is far (4,3) is Manhattan distance from enemy: |8-4| + |2-3| = 4+1=5. Enemy can\u2019t reach it in 1 move. But enemy could aim for it over 2 turns, but if I take it now, it\u2019s mine.  \n\nIf I take UP: after eating apple, my new head will be at (4,3), and my body will be: head (4,3), then old head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), tail (2,4). Next turn I\u2019ll have neck at (4,2), so only three directions possibly open from (4,3).  \n\nBut still, immediate apple grab puts me at 5 apples vs enemy 7 \u2014 closer in score.  \n\n**Mobility after each move:**  \n- UP (4,3): next turn possible moves: DOWN to (4,2) neck \u2192 invalid; LEFT (3,3) body segment? Let\u2019s check: body segments after eating: (4,3) is head, then (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (2,3), then (2,4). So (3,3) is my 4th body segment. So indeed, UP then LEFT hits body, so would be invalid next turn. UP then UP (4,4) empty, UP then RIGHT (5,3) empty. So next turn, from (4,3): valid = UP, RIGHT, and maybe none else (LEFT and DOWN invalid). 2 moves.  \n- RIGHT (5,2): next turn: from (5,2), neck at (4,2). Possible: UP(5,3) empty, DOWN(5,1) empty, LEFT(4,2) neck invalid, RIGHT(6,2) empty \u2192 3 moves. Good mobility, but no apple this turn.  \n- DOWN (4,1): next turn: neck at (4,2), so possible moves: UP to neck invalid, LEFT(3,1) empty, RIGHT(5,1) empty, DOWN(4,0) empty \u2192 3 moves but further from apples.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nTake apple now while safe, then navigate carefully to avoid dead ends. With enemy longer, I need apples to compete.  \n\nBest choice: UP for apple.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Possible enemy moves:\n- UP: (7, 3) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN: (7, 1) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT: (6, 2) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT: (8, 2) \u2192 its own body \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nManhattan distance from enemy head (7, 2) to my possible next positions:\n- If I go UP to (4, 4): distance = |7-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5 \u2192 safe from immediate collision.\n- If I go RIGHT to (5, 3): distance = |7-5| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 still safe from head-on collision this turn (since enemy can\u2019t reach my cell in 1 move).\n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible with either move.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples: (2, 9) far, (3, 0) far, (6, 1) closer, (6, 9) far, (0, 3) far.\nFrom my head:\n- UP (4, 4): no apple there, but moves me toward center/upper area.\n- RIGHT (5, 3): no apple there, but closer to (6, 1) apple (distance 3) than from (4, 3) currently (distance 4).\n\nActually, let's check distances from (4, 3):\nTo (6, 1): Manhattan = |4-6| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4.\nFrom (5, 3): to (6, 1) = |5-6| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nFrom (4, 4): to (6, 1) = |4-6| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo RIGHT gets me closer to (6, 1) apple.\n\nFrom (4, 3) to (3, 0) apple: distance = 6.\nFrom (5, 3): to (3, 0) = 5.\nFrom (4, 4): to (3, 0) = 7.\n\nSo RIGHT is better for apples overall.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nAfter UP to (4, 4): neck at (4, 3). Next turn moves from (4, 4):\n- UP (4, 5) empty.\n- DOWN (4, 3) neck \u2192 invalid.\n- LEFT (3, 4) empty.\n- RIGHT (5, 4) empty.\n\u2192 3 possible moves next turn.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (5, 3): neck at (4, 3).

Enemy might go LEFT to (6, 2) then DOWN to (6, 1) in 2 turns. If I go RIGHT to (5, 3), I\u2019m closer to (6, 1) than enemy\u2019s 2-turn path, but I\u2019d need to go RIGHT then DOWN then LEFT to get it \u2014 maybe not optimal.\n\nActually, (3, 0) apple: enemy distance = |7-3| + |2-0| = 4 + 2 = 6. My distance from (4, 3) = 6, from (5, 3) = 5. So RIGHT is better for (3, 0) too.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter this move, check if enemy moved toward (6, 1) apple. If so, maybe avoid confrontation since enemy is longer (7 apples vs my 5) \u2014 head-on collision would kill me. Prefer to collect less contested apples like (0, 3) or (2, 9) if path is safe.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe. RIGHT gets me closer to two apples (6, 1) and (3, 0), UP moves me away from them. UP also moves toward top row where apples (2, 9) and (6, 9) are, but those are far. RIGHT seems better for apple gathering.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Final move:**\nRIGHT",

Next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 all 4 directions possibly safe (need to check board then).  \n- RIGHT (8, 4): neck at (7, 4). Next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 all 4 directions possibly safe.  \n\nLEFT and RIGHT offer slightly better mobility because they don\u2019t block UP.\n\n**Long-term planning:**  \nEnemy snake #0 is long (length 10) and occupies bottom-right area. Moving LEFT toward columns 0\u20135 might be safer for future apple hunting (apples at (0,3), (0,4), (3,0)). Moving RIGHT puts me closer to enemy territory and possible traps.  \n\nLEFT seems strategically better: opens path to apples at left side while avoiding enemy body cluster.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT keeps options open and heads toward apples safely.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, no \u2014 check: body list: (5,5) is the tail, (6,5) before that. Let's trace: body is (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5). So (5,4) is empty. Yes. (5,4) is free. Correction: Actually, could be wrong \u2014 look at board: bottom-left 0,0. Board grid: at y=5, x=5, T is snake body; y=4: row says \"A . . . . . T T . .\" \u2014 (5,4) is dot . on the board display: \"5  . . . . . T T T . .\" so (5,4) is empty! OK. Let's double-check: board display row 4: \"4 A . . . . . T T . .\" \u2014 so positions: x=5: dot, x=6: T. So UP to (5,4) is safe.  \n- DOWN: (5,2) \u2192 board: row2: (5,2) shows dot . \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT: (4,3) \u2192 board row3: (4,3) dot? Actually row3 says \"3 A . . . . 1 T . . .\" \u2014 x=5: 1(head), x=4: dot. So safe.  \n- RIGHT: (6,3) \u2192 body segment? Oh, (6,3) is my body (first segment after head). So RIGHT is suicide.  \n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:** Enemy head at (4,0).  \nEnemy safe moves from (4,0):  \n- UP: (4,1) \u2192 empty? Row1: x=4: dot. Yes.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT: (3,0) \u2192 apple at (3,0)? Row0: \". . . A 0 T T T T .\" x=3: A; x=4: 0. So (3,0) is apple \u2192 safe for enemy (they eat apple and grow).  \n- RIGHT: (5,0) \u2192 body (5,0) from their body list: yes, occupied. So enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT.\n\nSo enemy might go UP or LEFT.  \n\nCheck if enemy can attack my next positions:  \n- My UP (5,4): distance from enemy\u2019s (4,0) after they move? Say enemy goes LEFT to (3,0): then distance to (5,4) = 6. Enemy goes UP to (4,1): dist to (5,4) = 4. No head-on collision risk.  \n- My DOWN (5,2): enemy at (4,1) or (3,0) \u2192 closest is (4,1): dist to (5,2) = 2 \u2192 but enemy can move there in 2 turns, so safe this turn.  \n- My LEFT (4,3): If enemy goes UP to (4,1) \u2192 dist to (4,3) = 2. Head-on possible? Not this turn. Enemy could move to (4,2) next, etc. No immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple seeking:**  \nClosest apple: (0,3), (0,4) are 5\u20136 away, (3,0) is 8 away if counting from (5,3). But (0,3) and (0,4) are cluster in top left.  \nMy body blocks top path through (5,4)? Not necessarily.  \nI could go UP then LEFT then up more toward (0,4). Would that work? Let\u2019s check: After UP (5,4), next turn neck at (5,3). Then UP again to (5,5) is my body? Wait (5,5) is tail (grows only if eat apple). So I can move into tail only if it moves. With no apple eaten, tail moves forward, so next turn (5,5) will be gone, replaced by new segment at (6,3) removed, etc. Actually after my UP movement, new body: head at (5,4), body now: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (6,5)] and tail (5,5) disappears (since no apple). So yes, the tail moves. So mobility after UP: at (5,4) neighbors: (5,5) gone so free; (4,4) free; (5,3) is neck; (6,4) is body. So next turn from (5,4): UP free, LEFT free, DOWN neck, RIGHT body. So only 2 moves.  \n\nLEFT (4,3): neck at (5,3). From (4,3): UP (4,4) free, DOWN (4,2) free, LEFT (3,3) free, RIGHT neck (5,3). So 3 moves. Better mobility.  \n\nDOWN (5,2): neck at (5,3). From (5,2): UP neck, DOWN (5,1) free, LEFT (4,2) free, RIGHT (6,2) is enemy body? Board row2: (6,2) 'T' enemy body \u2192 so only 2 moves. Worse.  \n\nSo LEFT is best mobility (3 exits).  \n\nAlso LEFT moves toward apples at (0,3) and (0,4) while avoiding enemy territory (bottom right).\n\n---\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** Keep moving left to target apples (0,3) and (0,4). Avoid colliding with enemy #0, which is long and mostly in bottom half. Try to stay in columns 0\u20134 to pick apples safely. Enemy likely heading to (3,0) apple this turn.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

So enemy can go UP or LEFT.  \n\n**Apples:** (2, 9), (6, 9), (0, 3), (0, 4), (6, 8)  \n\nClosest apple to my head (4, 3):  \n- (0, 3) distance = 4  \n- (0, 4) distance = 4  \n- (6, 8) distance = 5  \n- (6, 9) distance = 6  \n- (2, 9) distance = 6  \n\nSo best targets: (0, 3) and (0, 4).  \n\n**Mobility after each move:**  \n- UP (4, 4): neighbors: (4, 5) empty, (3, 4) empty, (5, 4) empty, (4, 3) neck \u2192 3 safe next moves.  \n- DOWN (4, 2): neighbors: (4, 1) empty, (3, 2) empty, (5, 2) empty? Wait, row 2: x=5 is dot? Actually row 2: \". . . . . . T T . .\" \u2014 x=5: dot, x=6: T (enemy). So (5, 2) empty. So (4, 2) \u2192 UP neck, others empty except neck \u2192 3 moves.  \n- LEFT (3, 3): neighbors: (3, 4) empty, (3, 2) empty, (2, 3) empty, (4, 3) neck \u2192 3 moves.  \n\nAll have equal mobility this turn.  \n\n**Long-term strategy:**  \nEnemy is long and in bottom rows. Apples at top left (0, 3) and (0, 4) are safest to pursue because enemy is far away.  \nLEFT moves toward those apples directly. UP also moves toward them but less directly.  \n\nLEFT seems best because:  \n- Moves toward target apples.  \n- Avoids enemy territory (bottom right).  \n- Keeps options open for next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nHead toward (0, 3) and (0, 4) via leftward movement, then upward. Avoid bottom rows where enemy snake is.  \n\nLEFT",

Actually at move time, my old body segment still at (0, 3) because I haven\u2019t moved yet, so if enemy goes UP to (0,3) it hits my body and dies.  \n- DOWN: (0, 1) \u2014 enemy's own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT: (-1, 2) \u2014 off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT: (1, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move: RIGHT to (1, 2).\n\n**Risk of head-on collision next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 4), enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (0, 5), enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 2) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo both safe for me.\n\n**Apples:**  \nApple closest and reachable: (7, 4) \u2014 need to go rightwards eventually but apple near enemy\u2019s area. Safer apple: (4, 7) maybe after some maneuvering.  \nApple at (6,9) and (2,9) far but possible later.\n\n**Mobility after each move:**  \n- UP (0, 5): neighbors: (0, 6) empty, (1, 5) empty, (0, 4) my neck \u2014 2 safe moves next.  \n- RIGHT (1, 4): neighbors: (1, 5) empty, (2, 4) empty, (1, 3) my body segment \u2014 2 safe moves next.  \n\nBoth keep options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is trapped in bottom-left region with one safe move to (1,2). I can stay safe on upper side away from it while planning an apple route. The apple at (4,7) is safer than (7,4) because (7,4) is near snake #0\u2019s possible future positions once it gets more freedom after moving.  \n\nFrom (0,4), going UP positions me to snake up the left side toward top apples like (2,9).  \n\nAvoid getting pinned against the walls; snake length is 9 now, so need space to avoid self-collision.\n\nGiven enemy will go RIGHT, I should avoid moving toward (1,4) unnecessarily because that brings me closer to enemy\u2019s path (enemy head at (1,2) after move), though no immediate danger. UP gives safer distancing.\n\n**Conclusion:** UP gives more space and keeps me clear of enemy\u2019s immediate path.\n\n---\n\nUP",
