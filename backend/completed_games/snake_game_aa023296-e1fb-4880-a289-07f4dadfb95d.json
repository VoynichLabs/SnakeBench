Moving UP gets me closer to this apple. After that, I can continue moving UP to reach it. The apple at (6, 3) is also relatively close, and I can reach it after getting the (5, 4) apple by going right and then up.\n\nMoving UP this turn creates a clear path to the (5, 4) apple, which seems to be the most efficient choice. My body will be at (5, 1) after this move, so next turn I'll need to avoid moving DOWN.\n\nFor my next turn strategy: Continue moving UP toward the (5, 4) apple, then plan to get the (6, 3) apple afterward.\n\nUP"
