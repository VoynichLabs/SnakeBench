Who's ready for chaos? \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick situational read (fast and loud):\n- Our head: (7,2). Opponent head: (9,5). Both have no body segments. Scores tied 0\u20130.\n- Nearby apples: (7,3) is RIGHT in front of us (one UP), (6,2) is LEFT, and (7,4) & (8,3) are right behind that UP apple. Lots of tasty options on our flank \u2014 let's capitalize. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud, as requested):\n1) Consider moves:\n   - UP -> (7,3) \u2014 apple! Good growth and opens immediate follow-ups to (7,4) and (8,3).\n   - LEFT -> (6,2) \u2014 apple, but after that our continuation options are less immediately juicy.\n   - DOWN -> (7,1) \u2014 safe but no apple; slower and gives opponent time.\n   - RIGHT -> (8,2) \u2014 safe but no apple and moves toward empty space.\n\n2) Eliminate deadly moves: none of these moves immediately kills us (no off-board, no body collisions). BACKWARDS rule irrelevant \u2014 we have no trailing segment that blocks a backstep this turn.\n\n3) Evaluate safety vs aggression:\n   - Opponent is at (9,5), too far to force any head-on collision this turn. We should avoid risky head-on fights until we have the length advantage.\n   - UP gives us immediate apple + two strong follow-ups (up to (7,4) or right to (8,3)). That chain lets us grow quickly and start hemming them in around the middle-right of the board.\n   - LEFT also eats but leaves fewer adjacent apples to continue the pressure.\n\nChoice and rationale:\n- I pick UP. Eat (7,3) now, get +1, increase our board presence, and immediately threaten (7,4) and (8,3) next turn. That keeps multiple escape/attack options open and builds the length advantage we want before forcing any head-on.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns (so it shows as our last rationale next turn):\n- After UP (eat at 7,3), go for the nearby follow-up apple (prioritize (7,4) or (8,3) depending on opponent movement). Build length to 2\u20133 quickly, then start cutting off the right side to box the opponent toward the edge and force them into risky collisions. Stay aggressive but avoid head-on until we have more apples than them.\n\nAlright, fans \u2014 let's eat and then trap 'em! Who's hyped?! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

They\u2019ll probably chase the apple at (7,4) or (8,3). Neither of those moves puts their head on (7,5), so a LEFT step won\u2019t trigger a head\u2011on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future\u2011proofing**  \nFrom (7,5) I can still go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn \u2013 plenty of wiggle room. From (8,4) I\u2019d also have options, but moving LEFT pushes me deeper into the apple\u2011dense corridor where the board is less crowded, giving me more room to manoeuvre and eventually box the rival in.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan**  \n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\u202f\u201cGrow aggressively toward the (7\u20118,\u202f4\u20115) apple cluster, keep my body flexible, and lure snake\u202f#1 into a tight corridor where a head\u2011on clash would end me with a higher score.

Less pressure, fewer apples nearby.\n- DOWN -> (7,2) = our body (backwards) = DEAD. Never that.\n\nChoice rationale:\n- We MUST eat and keep options. UP and RIGHT both get apples. I prefer RIGHT: eating at (8,3) aligns us vertically with the opponent at (8,5), so next turn we can threaten (8,4) and force risky responses. With our apple lead, a head-on or forced collision that kills both still hands us the win \u2014 but we don't need to suicide; we also keep escape options (LEFT or UP) from (8,3).\n- LEFT is too passive. DOWN is illegal. RIGHT is high-reward and keeps multiple follow-ups open.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Grab (8,3) now. Next turn threaten (8,4) \u2014 if opponent drops into that cell we can force a clash on our terms (we win ties because we have more apples).

Empty and gives us a direct LEFT next turn into (7,4) (apple) if the rival goes down. Keeps multiple follow-ups (UP/LEFT/RIGHT). Good for aggression.\n- RIGHT -> (9,3): SAFE but hugs the wall (x=9). Fewer options next turn (can't go RIGHT again).\n- LEFT -> (7,3): ILLEGAL \u2014 that's our own body (backwards). Don't be that guy.\n- DOWN -> (8,2): SAFE but moves away from the fight and apples. Also reduces immediate pressure on opponent.\n\nOpponent (7,5) obvious plays: DOWN to grab (7,4) apple (greedy), LEFT/RIGHT/UP are also possible. We currently lead 2\u20130, so a mutual head-on that kills both is a WIN for us. Want to FORCE or threaten head-on on our terms.\n\nDecision reasoning (short and spicy):\n- We want to be aggressive and set up a clash on (7,4). Moving UP to (8,4) next turn lets us go LEFT into (7,4) at the same time the opponent might go DOWN to grab it \u2014 mutual death = we win. Even if they dodge, being in (8,4) keeps three safe follow-ups (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) and dominates the vertical corridor toward them. RIGHT to (9,3) is viable but cramped; DOWN is passive. LEFT is dead. So UP maximizes options and pressure. \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf4e\n\nShort-term plan (write this down for next-turn rationale):\n- Move UP to threaten (7,4) next turn. If opponent drops for (7,4), meet him there for a favorable double-KO (we win on apples). If he flees, continue pressing up column 8 to box him toward the top edge and collect nearby apples while keeping escape routes.\n\nLet's go make him regret showing up. You ready?

The best balance is to stay aggressive while maximizing follow-up options \u2014 take the vertical line and keep the LEFT threat next turn. If they tries a greedy move into our body we win instantly; if they dodge, we can pivot LEFT next turn to trap or force collision on our terms.\n\nPlan (next 1\u20132 turns):\n- Move UP now to (8,5).

Be aggressive but calculated. LEFT pressures them into tighter options and threatens cutting off their escape to the right column. UP is safer and roomier, but less pressure. We want to dominate the board and bait mistakes.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20133 turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (6,5) to apply vertical pressure and shrink their safe area.\n- If they try to go UP or LEFT, pivot UP/LEFT to close corridors and chase. If they dash for the apple at (5,3) and grow, avoid stepping into their body \u2014 back off or pivot to force a head collision only if advantageous.\n- Keep our tail awareness high \u2014 never go into a tail cell if there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll grow this turn.\n\nLET\u2019S BAIT, TRAP, AND CLOSE THE DOOR \u2014 aggression, but do NOT be dumb.

That flexibility matters for trapping maneuvers. \ud83d\udd01\n- Don\u2019t trigger head-on: we avoid moving into any square they could occupy this turn, so no double KO while we\u2019re behind on apples.

Use our body to cut escape routes and only go for apples if they help the trap.\n- Avoid a head-on unless we lead in apples. If they overcommit, we\u2019ll bait them into our body and let them crash. If they try to flank left, pivot up and box them against the top wall.\n- Keep one escape route open until we\u2019ve actually cut off their exits \u2014 don\u2019t get boxed in ourselves.\n\nLET\u2019S MAKE \u2018EM CRASH \u2014 GO TIME! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

Move = suicide. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (9,9): EMPTY and the ONLY legal, safe move this turn. \u2705\n\nOpponent head (9,7) \u2014 their legal moves this turn: DOWN (9,6) or LEFT (8,7). They CANNOT reach (9,9) this turn, so no immediate head-on risk if we go RIGHT.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take RIGHT to (9,9) now \u2014 survival first, pressure second.  \n- Watch how the opponent shifts their tail; don\u2019t get stuck pinned in the top-right corner. From (9,9) our follow-up will likely be DOWN once (9,8) is clear \u2014 but only if it\u2019s safe. Avoid corner suicide by ensuring we have at least one open escape cell before committing.  \n- Maintain aggression by cutting off their horizontal escape (x=6\u20138) when we can, but DO NOT force a head-on while apples are tied 5\u20135. Wait for a one-apple lead before risking collide plays.\n\nWe\u2019re forced but smart \u2014 we take the only safe cell and keep plotting the trap. LET\u2019S GOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

UP would walk into my own segment \u2013 instant KO. RIGHT is off\u2011board \u2013 instant KO. So I\u2019m left with DOWN and LEFT. Both keep me alive, but which one pushes me toward victory? \ud83c\udf4e The nearest apple sits at (9,\u202f3) far below, and sliding DOWN puts me on a straight shot to eat it and grow. Meanwhile the rival\u2019s head is perched at (8,\u202f9); they can only move DOWN or LEFT, so they can\u2019t reach (9,\u202f6) this turn. If I move LEFT I end up at (8,\u202f7), which is directly under the enemy, possibly setting up a future collision but also cutting off some escape routes. Moving DOWN keeps the right\u2011most column open, lets me chase that juicy (9,\u202f3) apple, and still leaves me with two viable exits next turn (DOWN or LEFT). So DOWN feels like the aggressive, apple\u2011hunting choice that also preserves flexibility. \n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Long\u2011term plan: \n- Keep sliding down the right edge to harvest (9,3) and later (9,0) apples. \n- Once I\u2019ve got a size advantage, pivot left to box the opponent and force a head\u2011on collision. \n- Stay aware of my own tail and the enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\nDOWN",
