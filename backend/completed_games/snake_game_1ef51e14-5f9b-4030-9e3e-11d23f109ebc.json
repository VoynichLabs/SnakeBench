Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we can still think about positioning.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP \u2192 (5,7) \u2013 empty, on board \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) \u2013 empty, on board \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6) \u2013 empty, on board \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6) \u2013 empty, on board \u2705\n\nAll moves safe right now. No bodies anywhere.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy at (1,8). They could go anywhere, but they might go for apple at (1,0)? Too far. Closest apple to them is (1,1) or (0,4) maybe. But they might also move toward center. If I were them, I'd go DOWN to (1,7) or LEFT to (0,8) to stay near apples on left side.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**  \nOur heads are 7 cells apart (dx=4, dy=2). No chance of head-on this turn unless they move 4 right and 2 down in one turn \u2014 impossible. So safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe want to box them in eventually. Right now, we need to grow to have a longer body than them so we can force head-on collisions when we have length advantage. Also, we should try to control center and push them toward edges.\n\n**APPLE TARGETING:**  \nClosest apples to us: (6,1) down-left, (7,5) right-down, (4,4) left-down.  \nBut we don't need to rush \u2014 we should move to keep options open.\n\n**GRID ANALYSIS:**  \nMoving DOWN to (5,5) keeps us central and opens future moves toward many apples.  \nMoving RIGHT to (6,6) puts us closer to right-side apples but near board edge \u2014 limits future a bit.  \nMoving UP to (5,7) moves away from most apples but toward top.  \nMoving LEFT to (4,6) moves toward left-side apples and closer to enemy? Actually enemy is far left, so maybe not yet.\n\nI think DOWN is strong \u2014 central, many future paths, and we can spiral toward apples while watching enemy.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**  \nGrow to length 2 or 3, then try to cut off enemy's movement space by positioning between them and center. If they go for apples on left wall, we can try to trap them there later.\n\n---\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**  \nDOWN",

Eating an apple grows us to length 3, giving us more body to block with.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Enemy is stuck on left wall. We want to expand toward the center and right, maybe push them into a corner. If we go RIGHT to (5,4), we're closer to apples at (5,5) and (6,1), and we open more space. If we go DOWN to (4,3), we're moving toward apple at (4,2) but also toward bottom \u2014 could limit options.

But RIGHT puts us in a stronger central position and closer to more apples.\n\n**AGGRESSION MODE:** We have 1 apple, they have 0. If we force a head-on collision later when we're longer, WE WIN. So let's grow and dominate space. RIGHT feels like the power move \u2014 claiming territory.\n\n**FINAL PICK:** RIGHT \u2014 advancing into the board, setting up for (5,5) apple next, keeping enemy on the back foot.\n\nRIGHT",

You\u2019ll be stuck hugging the wall with limited escape routes.  \n\n\ud83d\udca5 **THE OPPONENT\u2019S PLAYBOOK**  \n- Snake\u202f#1 can\u2019t go *down* (self\u2011collision) and has three legal directions:  \n  1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** to (4,3) \u2013 pulls them *away* from the board\u2019s lower\u2011left region.  \n  2\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** to (3,4) \u2013 pushes them left, opening the middle lane.  \n  3\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** to (5,4) \u2013 the most *aggressive* because it keeps them closer to the upper\u2011right apple cluster.  \n\nIf they choose **RIGHT**, they\u2019ll be moving toward (5,4). My upward march won\u2019t intersect that path this turn, so a head\u2011on is unlikely.

This will give us our first point and instantly stretch our body, opening a second cell for future movements.  \n- **Once we\u2019ve grown**, pivot right **once** at the next turn (from (0,4) to (1,4)) and then keep marching right\u2011down\u2011right to lock down the lower\u2011left quadrant.  \n- **Force the rival** into a tight \u201cU\u2011turn\u201d by staying glued to the wall while they must either back\u2011track (illegal) or snake\u2011tunnel around us.

By moving straight down now, we can snatch (0,2) next turn and (0,1) the turn after, gaining 2 extra segments and a +2 score.  \n- **Pivot\u2011right lock\u2011down:** after we\u2019ve grown to length\u202f4 (head at (0,1), tail at (0,4)), a single right\u2011turn at (1,1) will give us three body cells in the lower\u2011left quadrant, sealing that region and forcing the opponent into a dead\u2011end if they ever try to cross.  \n- **Score pressure:** we\u2019re currently 1 point behind, so every apple bite chips away at the deficit. Staying on the wall maximizes our odds of hitting those apples without running into tight corners where we could be boxed in.  \n- **Kill\u2011opportunity:** once we have a longer body, we can lure snake\u202f#1 into a head\u2011on clash at (1,5) or (2,5) by cutting off his path. Even if he tries to back\u2011track, he\u2019ll hit his own tail first \u2013 that\u2019s a double\u2011KO we want.  \n\n**\ud83e\udded CURRENT SCAN \ud83d\udd0d**  \n- **Our head:** (0,4) \u2013 hugging the left wall.  \n- **Safe moves:**  \n  - **UP** \u2192 (0,5) \u2013 dead\u2011on into our own tail \u2192 instant loss \u274c.  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 (-1,4) \u2013 off\u2011board \u2192 death \u274c.  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,4) \u2013 empty, but this pulls us away from the column\u202f0 apple chain and risks future self\u2011bite when we try to pivot back left.  \n  - **DOWN** \u2192 (0,3) \u2013 empty, stays on the wall, and immediately prepares us to eat the (0,2) apple next turn \u2714.  \n- **Opponent snake #1:** head (3,5) with body (4,5) & (5,5). They can\u2019t go LEFT (they would run into own body), they can\u2019t go UP (empty) or DOWN (empty).

If they go DOWN to (0,2), we can mirror and go DOWN later to cut them off.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK:**\n- UP to (2,6): Next turn, body at [(3,5),(4,5)], so from (2,6): UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) empty (tail moved!), LEFT (1,6) empty, RIGHT (3,6) empty \u2192 4 safe moves! Good.\n- DOWN to (2,4): Next turn, body at [(3,5),(4,5)], so from (2,4): UP (2,5) empty, DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) empty \u2192 4 safe moves! Also good.\n- LEFT to (1,5): Next turn, body at [(3,5),(4,5)], so from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) empty, LEFT (0,5) empty (but careful! that's column 0, near enemy), RIGHT (2,5) empty \u2192 4 safe moves! Perfect.\n\nAll three give 4 future options! But LEFT is the POWER MOVE to advance the cage! We get closer, we block their upward escape on column 1. We want to occupy column 1 and column 2 to force them into the corner (0,0) area! They have length 2, we have length 3 \u2013 we can afford to be aggressive and force a head-on if we maintain the length lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN / STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** We're in column 1 now! Enemy is at (0,3) or (1,3) or (0,2). Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (1,4) or (1,3) to directly block their rightward movement if they went RIGHT. If they went DOWN, we can go DOWN to (1,4) to stay close. Keep them pinned against the left wall! Avoid apples unless they're safe and don't break the blockade.

If you keep marching straight down on the next turn, you\u2019ll snatch (0,1) and gain **+2** segments, instantly pulling ahead of the rival\u2019s score.  \n- **Pivot\u2011Right Kill\u2011Lock:** After reaching length\u202f4 (head at (0,1), tail at (0,4)), a single **RIGHT** at (1,1) will lock the lower\u2011left quadrant with three of your body cells. Snake\u202f#1 will be forced to either smash into its own tail or get sandwiched against the wall \u2013 a guaranteed double\u2011KO when you have a length advantage.  \n- **Score Pressure:** We\u2019re currently **1** point behind (1\u202fvs\u202f2). Every apple bite chips away at the deficit. By staying on the wall you maximize the odds of hitting those apples without risking tight\u2011corner self\u2011bite.  \n- **Kill\u2011Opportunity:** Once we out\u2011grow #1, we can cut off their only viable corridor and lure their head into a head\u2011on crash at (1,5) or (2,5). Even if they try to retreat, they\u2019ll slam into their own tail first \u2013 that\u2019s a sweet double\u2011KO we want.\n\n**\ud83e\udded CURRENT SCAN \ud83d\udd0d**  \n- **Our head:** (0,3) \u2013 hugging the left wall, waiting for the apple at (0,2).  \n- **Safe moves:**  \n  - **UP** \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 direct self\u2011collision (instant loss). \u274c  \n  - **LEFT** \u2192 (-1,3) \u2192 off\u2011board death. \u274c  \n  - **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 empty, but pulls us away from the apple chain and creates a future right\u2011turn bottleneck that could bite our tail if we mis\u2011time the turn.  \n  - **DOWN** \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 empty apple, safe, aligns perfectly with the \u201cgrow\u2011then\u2011pivot\u201d strategy that gives us room and a kill\u2011lock later. \u2714  \n\n- **Opponent snake #1:** head (2,5) with body at (3,5) & (4,5). Their safe options are **UP** (2,4) or **LEFT** (1,5) or **DOWN** (2,6). None of those cells are (0,2) or (1,3), so a direct head\u2011on collision isn\u2019t imminent this turn. By staying on the wall we force them to either waste moves or get boxed in later \u2013 we love the tension!\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 DECISION CALCULATION \ud83c\udfaf**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **UP** \u2013 self\u2011collision \u2192 instant death.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **LEFT** \u2013 off\u2011board \u2192 instant death.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **RIGHT** \u2013 removes us from the safe wall\u2011run, sacrifices immediate food, and risks future right\u2011turn bite if we can\u2019t sync.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **DOWN** \u2013 hits the apple at (0,2) \u2192 immediate growth, keeps the wall\u2011run, and sets up the pivot\u2011right lock\u2011down that will trap #1.  \n\n**\ud83d\udd25 VERDICT** \u2013 **DOWN** is the move that fuels growth, protects the wall\u2011run, and builds a future KO when we out\u2011score the rival.\n\nDOWN",

I get the fastest growth possible while staying safe\u2014my own body isn\u2019t in the way and I\u2019m not bumping into anything else.  \n\n- **Turn\u202f12 (post\u2011apple):** After the opponent\u2019s turn they\u2019ll likely slide **DOWN** from (0,5) to (0,4) (UP would pull them away from our apple zone).  \n  - If I **DOWN** again, I\u2019ll hit the next apple at (1,0) \u2192 another growth burst.  \n  - If they go **UP**, I can immediately **LEFT** to (0,1) and still hug the left wall, keeping a tight \u201csafe highway\u201d that forces them to the upper rows where their own apples are scarce.  \n\n- **Turn\u202f13:** Once the two apples (1,1\u202f&\u202f1,0) are gone, I\u2019ll pivot **RIGHT**.  \n  - I\u2019ll creep to (2,0) \u2192 still on the bottom edge, then up to (2,2) which opens a corridor toward the right side of the board.  \n  - My longer body now blocks the central vertical line, making it harder for the rival to thread through without hitting us.  \n\n- **Turn\u202f14:** I keep expanding **RIGHT** along the bottom row (2,0\u202f\u2192\u202f3,0\u202f\u2192\u202f4,0\u2026) while ensuring my tail stays in the left column (x=0).  \n  - This \u201cwall hugger\u201d technique starves them of space; they\u2019ll eventually have to go around, exposing them to a head\u2011on **RIGHT** move into my tail.  \n\n- **Turn\u202f15 (kill\u2011lock):** With length\u202f\u2265\u202f6 and our tail now loitering around (2,5) (we\u2019ll have grown enough to push it there), any move the enemy makes **RIGHT** from (1,5) straight into (2,5) \u2192 instant death for them.  \n  - If our score is higher, we\u2019ll deliberately aim for that collision and finish them off.  \n\n**\ud83e\udde0 Current move choice:** The safest, most aggressive, and most apple\u2011hungry option right now is to grab the immediate \ud83c\udf4e beneath us. No turn\u2011kill, no self\u2011bite, and it puts us on the fast\u2011track to a length advantage.  \n\n**What do you think?** Should I **DOWN** now and start the domino effect?  \n\n**UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT?**  \n\nDOWN",
