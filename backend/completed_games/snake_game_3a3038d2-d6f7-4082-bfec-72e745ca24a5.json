Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7, 5), length 1.\nApples are at (9, 7), (5, 5), (5, 3), (9, 8), (0, 0).\n\nMy goal is to eat apples and survive, preferably maximizing my chances of getting the nearest apples.\n\nMy current location is (0, 8).\n\nPossible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Check for immediate death from boundaries or self-collision (I have no body, so only boundaries matter initially):**\n    *   UP: (0, 9). Safe. (Apple at (9, 8) is far, but (0, 9) is safe)\n    *   DOWN: (0, 7). Safe.\n    *   LEFT: (-1, 8). Out of bounds. **DEAD.**\n    *   RIGHT: (1, 8). Safe.\n\n2.  **Check for collision with enemy snake (ID 1) at (7, 5):**\n    Since the enemy is far away, collision is highly unlikely on turn 1 unless I move towards them very aggressively, which none of the safe moves do.\n\n3.  **Evaluate safe moves based on proximity to apples and future options:**\n\n    *   Apples near me: None immediately next to (0, 8).\n        *   (0, 0) is 8 units away (DOWN 8).\n        *   (9, 8) is 9 units away (RIGHT 9).\n        *   (9, 7) is 9 units away (RIGHT 9, DOWN 1).\n        *   (5, 5) is 5 units away (RIGHT 5, DOWN 3).\n        *   (5, 3) is 5 units away (RIGHT 5, DOWN 5).\n\n    *   The snake 1 is at (7, 5).\n\n    *   **UP (to 0, 9):** Moves me to the top edge. It keeps the column open but doesn't immediately approach any close apples. The apple at (9, 8) is far away.\n    *   **DOWN (to 0, 7):** Moves me closer to the apple at (0, 0). This seems like a good long-term path.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 1, 8):** Moves me towards the center/right side where 4 of the 5 apples are.\n\n4.  **Strategic consideration:**\n    *   The apple at (0, 0) is uncontested by Snake 1 (which is at (7, 5) and likely moving (5, 5) or similar). Moving DOWN secures the corner and sets me up for (0, 0). It might take 8 moves to reach, but it guarantees a growth opportunity without conflict.\n    *   Moving RIGHT aims for the cluster of apples on the right side of the board. I need to be careful of Snake 1. Snake 1 is closer to (5, 5) and (5, 3). Snake 1 is also relatively close to (9, 7) and (9, 8).\n\n    If I move RIGHT to (1, 8), I am 6 units from (5, 5) and (5, 3). Snake 1 is 1 unit from (7, 5), 2 units from (5, 5). Snake 1 is likely targeting (5, 5) or (5, 3) by moving LEFT or DOWN. If Snake 1 goes LEFT to (6, 5), they are 1 unit closer to (5, 5).\n\n    Given my position on the far left, prioritizing the uncontested (0, 0) apple seems safer. However, (0, 0) is quite far (8 moves). If I go RIGHT, I put myself in contention for the 4 closer apples, but also increase collision risk.\n\n    Let's look at relative distances to the closest apples: (5, 5) and (5, 3).\n    Distance from me (0, 8): 8 units (5X + 3Y) for (5, 5). 10 units (5X + 5Y) for (5, 3).\n    Distance from Snake 1 (7, 5): 2 units (2X) for (5, 5). 4 units (2X + 2Y) for (5, 3).\n\n    Snake 1 can reach (5, 5) fast (e.g., L, L). They will almost certainly grab (5, 5) or (5, 3).\n\n    My nearest *uncontested* apple is (0, 0).\n\n    Move sequence for (0, 0): (0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> ... -> (0, 0). This is safe and guarantees an apple.\n\n    Strategy: Head DOWN towards (0, 0). This minimizes collision risk in the early game and secures an apple for growth.\n\n    Move 1: DOWN (to 0, 7)\n\nI will aim for (0, 0) for initial growth, moving DOWN for the next 8 turns, assuming no immediate threats or changes required.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\n**Proximity to Apples (from 0, 5):**\n*   (0, 0): 5 moves (straight DOWN).\n*   (5, 3): 7 moves (5R, 2D). (Snake 1's likely target this turn)\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe plan to secure (0, 0) remains the safest and most efficient initial growth strategy. I need 5 more DOWN moves.\n\nMove DOWN (to 0, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN towards (0, 0).

Score becomes 1.\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 1):** Out of bounds. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 1):** Moves away from the target apple (0, 0).\n\n**Safety Check:**\n1.  Collision with self: Impossible, length is 1.\n2.  Off board: LEFT is fatal.\n3.  Collision with Snake 1:\n    *   Snake 1 Head: (2, 3).\n    *   Snake 1 Body: (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3).\n    *   My move (0, 0) is nowhere near Snake 1's present or predicted locations. Safe.\n\n**Proximity to Apples (from 0, 1):**\n*   (0, 0): 1 move (straight DOWN). (My target)\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe optimal and safe move is DOWN to secure the apple (0, 0).\n\n**Post-Apple (0, 0) Strategy (for Turn 8/9):**\nAfter eating (0, 0), my head will be at (0, 0) and my body will be at (0, 1) (L=2). The remaining apples are high and to the right: (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (9, 5).\n\nDistances from (0, 0) (Manhattan):\n*   (8, 6): 8 + 6 = 14 moves.\n*   (9, 5): 9 + 5 = 14 moves.\n*   (9, 7): 9 + 7 = 16 moves.\n*   (9, 8): 9 + 8 = 17 moves.\n\nSnake 1 is currently at (2, 3). It is much closer to (8, 6) (6 + 3 = 9 moves, possibly less with diagonal movement) and (9, 5) (7 + 2 = 9 moves).\n\nI must move quickly to the main body of the board. I will prioritize moving UP or RIGHT aggressively towards the center/right side.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, my next move must be RIGHT (to 1, 0) since UP goes into my own body (0, 1). This is incorrect. If I move DOWN to (0, 0), my new body is at (0, 1). My next safe exit is only RIGHT to (1, 0).\n\nTurn 8 (Head at (0, 0), Body at (0, 1)):\nSafe moves: RIGHT (to 1, 0). UP (to 0, 1) hits tail (fatal based on rules update for this competition - *if moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die*). Since (0, 1) is where my new tail segment (old head) will be, I cannot move UP.\n\nMy priority is clear: take (0, 0). The follow-up move will be RIGHT.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

Moving UP from (1, 0) to (1, 1) seems like a good intermediate step, while keeping the option to turn right later.\n\nFor Turn 8, the move is unambiguously RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Given that Snake 1's most optimal path to (4, 2) is RIGHT, moving UP might be safe, but there is a risk of a block/collision if Snake 1 moves down defensively or aggressively.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, -1):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 0):** Moves into my body (0, 0). **FATAL.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 0):**\n    *   Safe from board/self.\n    *   Enemy collision check: Snake 1 is likely moving away (to the right, up, or left) from X=2.

Distance to (4, 2) from (2, 0): (4-2) + (2-0) = 4 moves.\n\n**Evaluation & Strategy:**\n\nMy main goals are to survive and reach the next apple. The apple at (4, 2) is the closest.\n\n**If I move UP to (1, 1):**\n*   Distance to (4, 2): (4-1) + (2-1) = 4 moves.\n*   Risk: Collision if Snake 1 moves DOWN to (1, 1). This risks a head-on collision or, more likely, Snake 1 blocking the path toward (4, 2) if it moves down. Snake 1 might move DOWN if it assumes I prioritize going UP, or if it wants to cut off the corner near (0, 0) for its body movements, although RIGHT seems more tactical for it.\n\n**If I move RIGHT to (2, 0):**\n*   Distance to (4, 2): 4 moves.\n*   Risk: Low collision risk, as Snake 1 is likely moving at Y=2 or Y=3. This keeps me along the bottom edge, maintaining safety and progress.\n\nBoth UP (1, 1) and RIGHT (2, 0) put me 4 moves away from (4, 2), assuming optimal subsequent moves.\n\nSince Snake 1 is at (1, 2) and aiming for (4, 2), its most efficient move is to **RIGHT** (to 2, 2). This move makes it highly unlikely for it to interfere with my move to (2, 0). If I move UP to (1, 1), and Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (2, 2), I am fine, but I risk being easily cut off by Snake 1's body if it then moves DOWN/RIGHT.\n\nMoving RIGHT maintains maximum distance from Snake 1 and commits me to the horizontal approach towards (4, 2) while keeping the Y-axis clear.\n\nI am choosing RIGHT to progress safely towards the nearest apple, minimizing interaction with Snake 1, which is likely moving right itself.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter reaching (2, 0), my next move will likely be UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0), depending on how Snake 1 positions itself relative to (4, 2). I need to race Snake 1 for the (4, 2) apple\u2014it currently has a 3-move lead assuming my plan works.

I must either anticipate a potential block or pivot to the right.\n\n**Enemy Analysis (Snake #1 at 2, 2):**\nTo reach (4, 2) in 2 moves, Snake 1 must move:\n1.  RIGHT (3, 2) -> RIGHT (4, 2). (Eats apple on Turn 11).\n2.  UP (2, 3): Moves into its body (2, 3). FATAL.\n3.  DOWN (2, 1):\n    *   Distance to (4, 2): (4-2) + (2-1) = 3 moves. Less optimal.\n    *   This is a defensive or blocking move.\n4.  LEFT (1, 2): Reverts progress. Moves into its body (1, 2) (if tail doesn't move). Wait, the body segment is (1, 2). Moving LEFT is **FATAL** because the segment (1, 2) is currently part of its body.\n\nThus, Snake 1's most likely (and only efficient) move is **RIGHT** to (3, 2).\n\n**Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 2, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 1):**\n    *   Safe from board/self.\n    *   Collision Check: Snake 1 is likely moving RIGHT to (3, 2). If Snake 1 instead moves DOWN to (2, 1), we have a head-on collision. This is a high-risk move if Snake 1 decides to be aggressive or defensive. However, if Snake 1 moves RIGHT, moving UP puts me 3 moves away from the apple (4, 2) - (4-2) + (2-1) = 3 moves. This is the optimal path for me to reach (4, 2) quickly.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, -1):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 0):** Moves into my body (1, 0). **FATAL.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 0):**\n    *   Safe from board/self.\n    *   Collision Check: Snake 1 is moving at Y=2. Safe.\n    *   Distance to (4, 2): (4-3) + (2-0) = 3 moves.\n\n**Evaluation & Strategy:**\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1), and Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 2), then Snake 1 will eat the apple on the next turn (Turn 11). I would then be at (2, 1), still three moves away from the now-eaten apple spot.\n\nIf Snake 1 commits to the apple at (4, 2), I should pivot to the next best target, which is the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (near X=9).\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on the assumption that (4, 2) will be eaten by Snake 1 on Turn 11.\n\n**Target Pivot: Right Side Cluster ((9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (9, 5))**\n\n1.  **Move UP (2, 1):**\n    *   Distance to (9, 7): (9-2) + (7-1) = 7 + 6 = 13 moves.\n    *   This keeps me closer to the center, which could be useful if Snake 1 vacates the area.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (3, 0):**\n    *   Distance to (9, 7): (9-3) + (7-0) = 6 + 7 = 13 moves.\n    *   This keeps me safely away from Snake 1 and commits me to the bottom boundary path towards the cluster.\n\nBoth UP (2, 1) and RIGHT (3, 0) result in the same Manhattan distance to the cluster.\n\nHowever, moving UP (2, 1) carries a significant risk of a fatal head-on collision if Snake 1 decides to move DOWN (2, 1), perhaps to block me or simply grow its body in a safe spot if it thinks I am contesting the apple. While RIGHT (3, 2) is the most logical offensive move for Snake 1, risking a fatal collision that gives the game to Snake 1 (since they have more apples) is unwise.\n\nMoving **RIGHT (3, 0)**:\n*   Guarantees survival this turn (no self-hit, no wall hit, low enemy conflict).\n*   Progresses towards the main cluster of apples (9, 5) which is (9-3) + (5-0) = 11 moves away, a slight improvement on the previous target.\n*   Keeps me far away from Snake 1's path, allowing Snake 1 to claim the (4, 2) apple without interference, while I secure a safe position for my future growth.\n\nSince Snake 1 will almost certainly take (4, 2), maximizing safety and pivoting is the best long-term move.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** Use the bottom edge to travel to the right side of the board (5, 0) / (6, 0) / (7, 0), then move up the right wall (9, Y) to collect the cluster of four apples (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8), and (8, 6). This will rapidly increase my score and length.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples collected: 1.\nEnemy Snake #1 is at head (3, 2), body [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. Length 4. Apples collected: 3.\n\nApples remaining: (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (9, 5), (4, 2).\n\n*Self-Assessment of Last Move (RIGHT from 2, 0 to 3, 0):*\nThe rationale was sound: pivot away from the contested (4, 2) apple and move towards the safe, isolated cluster of apples on the right (X=9). Snake 1 did indeed move RIGHT from (2, 2) to (3, 2). This move was safe and placed me well for the long-term plan.\n\n*Apple (4, 2) Update:*\nSnake 1 is now at (3, 2). To reach (4, 2), Snake 1 needs one more move RIGHT. It is highly likely Snake 1 will consume this apple this turn (Turn 11).\n\n*Long-term Goal:* Secure the cluster of apples on the right side of the board: (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (9, 5).\n\n**Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 3, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe (no wall, no self-hit, far from Snake 1).\n    *   *Proximity to target (9, 5):* (9-3) + (5-1) = 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, -1):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 0):** Moves onto my body (2, 0). **FATAL.** (Moving backwards from the head (3, 0) to the first body segment (2, 0)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 0):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe (no wall, no self-hit, far from Snake 1).\n    *   *Proximity to target (9, 5):* (9-4) + (5-0) = 5 + 5 = 10 moves.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to the same Manhattan distance (10 moves) to the lower-most apple in the cluster (9, 5).\n\n**Strategic Comparison (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move UP (3, 1):** This starts moving me up the y-axis immediately, preparing to cut across the middle of the board (Y=1, Y=2, Y=3). This path might be slightly faster to reach the cluster if I can maintain a straight line towards (9, 5).\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 0):** This continues along the bottom edge (Y=0). This keeps me maximally separated from Snake 1 (currently at 3, 2, likely moving to 4, 2). It's a safer, more predictable approach along the wall. Snake 1, after eating (4, 2), will likely have its head at (4, 2) and tail at (3, 2) (or (2, 2) if it doesn't grow). If I move along Y=0, I reduce any chance of collision later as Snake 1 will be operating up at Y=2 or higher.\n\nGiven the priority is rapidly reaching the cluster while maintaining safety and keeping options open:\nMoving RIGHT at (4, 0) establishes a trajectory along the bottom wall towards X=9.\n\n*   Current location: (3, 0)\n*   Target route: (4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0) -> (9, 0), then UP.\n\nThis route provides the most open space and minimizes interactions with Snake 1, which will be growing and maneuvering around the center-right area (Y=2 and up) after eating (4, 2).\n\nI will choose **RIGHT**.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving along the bottom edge (Y=0) towards X=9 to secure the large apple cluster on the right wall. The next few moves will be RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, then UP.\n\nRIGHT",

Movement to (4, 1) is safe unless Snake 1 moves DOWN to (4, 1), which is possible if it decided to pivot immediately.\n    *   *Strategic:* This cuts the corner, moving towards the apples up-and-right. Manhattan distance to (9, 5): (9-4) + (5-1) = 5 + 4 = 9.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, -1):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 0):** Moves onto my body (3, 0). **FATAL.** (Moving backwards).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 0):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.

While Snake 1 has many apples up high, it might pivot down to secure the bottom right or try to trap me. Given Snake 1 just grew, its goal should be reaching new food, likely upwards or rightwards (e.g., to 5, 2, or 4, 3). If Snake 1 moves RIGHT (5, 2), my UP move is safe. If Snake 1 moves UP (4, 3), my UP move is safe. If Snake 1 moves LEFT (3, 2), my UP move is safe. The only collision risk is if Snake 1 moves DOWN (4, 1). This is low probability but not impossible.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (5, 0):** Zero risk of collision or being cut off by Snake 1, as Snake 1's tail is at (1, 3) and its head is at (4, 2). This maximizes safety and keeps me on the fastest clear path to the destination.\n\nSince the goal is long-term survival and reaching the high-value cluster, prioritizing safety and a clear path is key. Moving RIGHT ensures I continue my uncontested approach along the bottom wall.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving RIGHT along Y=0 until X=9, then move UP to enter the apple dense area (9, 5, 9, 7, 9, 8).

The apple (6, 5) is also relatively close if I decide to pivot up.\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 6, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 1):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe from board edges and my own body. Snake 1 is at (6, 2). If Snake 1 moves DOWN (6, 2 -> 6, 1), we collide head-on immediately. This is a very high risk. Snake 1 is currently 2 steps away from the apple (6, 5) if it pivots up, but moving down to block me or patrol the bottom is also possible.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves directly towards the apple (6, 5). MD to (6, 5) is 5 squares (1 UP, 4 UP). If I move to (6, 1), MD is 4.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, -1):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 0):** Moves onto my body (5, 0). **FATAL.** (Moving backwards).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 0):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Completely clear of Snake 1. Snake 1 is at (6, 2). Snake 1 would have to move RIGHT (7, 2) and DOWN twice to interfere later, which doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.\n    *   *Strategic:* Continues the safe path along the wall towards the main apple cluster on the right. MD to (9, 5): (9-7) + 5 = 7.\n\n**Strategic Comparison (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 6, 1):** Immediate, high risk of head-on collision with Snake 1 if they move DOWN (6, 2 -> 6, 1). Snake 1 could easily try to challenge the center/bottom area or block access to the right. Given the enemy is right above me at (6, 2), moving UP is extremely dangerous.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 7, 0):** Zero collision risk. It maintains the isolation previously established, allowing me to reach the right border (X=9) safely before deciding to turn UP. This continues the main objective of reaching the dense apple cluster.\n\n**Decision:** The move RIGHT is the only safe and strategically sound option that continues my path toward the high-value apples on the right edge without risking an immediate fatal collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving RIGHT along Y=0 until X=9. Then pivot UP to access (9, 5) and the higher apples.\n\nRIGHT",

It complicates my approach to the X=9 apples.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 8, 0):** This is a clean, safe move that puts me one step closer to the edge. It minimizes interaction with Snake 1, whose current position (6, 3) suggests it might be targeting (6, 5) or moving further up/left in the center. Moving right allows me to maintain separation and guarantee access to the large apple cluster.\n\n**Decision:** Continue moving RIGHT. This maintains maximum safety and efficiency towards the primary target zone.\n\n**Long-term Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (8, 0). (Current move)\n2. Move RIGHT to (9, 0).\n3.

Its closest apples are (8, 6) and (9, 5). Snake #1 moved RIGHT from (7, 5) to (8, 5) last turn.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (8, 5):\n*   UP (8, 6): EATS the apple at (8, 6).

This would be a direct competition point.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves to (9, 5), it will eat the apple. If I move UP to (9, 3), I am still two moves away from (9, 5). Snake #1 could potentially reach (9, 5) this turn.\n\nLet's check for collisions:\nIf ID 0 moves UP to (9, 3).\nIf ID 1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5) (EATS apple). No collision.\n\nIf Snake #1 chooses (8, 6) or (8, 4), it maximizes its score. Given its location, (8, 6) seems slightly more likely as it keeps it higher on the board near other apples (9, 7, 9, 8). If it ignores the X=9 column completely, that's better for me.\n\nThe move UP for Snake ID 0 is entirely safe, regardless of Snake #1's move, and advances my position towards the remaining X=9 apples.\n\n**Decision:** Continue UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan for next few turns:**\n1.

Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)]. Length 7 (Length 6 + 1 for apple eaten last turn). Apples collected: 6.\n*Note: Snake #1 must have eaten the apple at (9, 5) last turn, otherwise its head would not be there unless it moved over its tail, which is not the case here.*\n\nApples remaining: (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (8, 4), (7, 7).\n\nMy snake is positioned along the X=9 wall, two steps below the cluster of apples at (9, 7) and (9, 8). Snake #1 is also along the X=9 wall, two steps above me, potentially blocking access or competing for these high-value apples.\n\nMy next immediate goal is to continue moving up the X=9 wall to reach the apples (9, 7) and (9, 8).\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 9, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Cell (9, 4) is currently empty.\n    *   *Strategic:* Advances directly towards (9, 7) and (9, 8). The path is clear for two more moves (to 9, 6). If Snake #1 moves away from the wall, this is excellent.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 2):** Moves onto my body (9, 2). **FATAL** (Moving backwards).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Empty cell.\n    *   *Strategic:* Useful for repositioning if the wall becomes blocked, but currently diverts from the target apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 3):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nThe safest and most strategic move is UP.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis (at 9, 5):**\nSnake #1 just ate an apple (presumably at 9, 5) and is now longer (L=7). It is strategically positioned to target (9, 7) or (9, 8) or (8, 6).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 5):\n*   UP (9, 6): Safe. Advances toward (9, 7) and (9, 8).\n*   DOWN (9, 4): This is exactly where I want to go. If ID 1 moves DOWN, we have a **HEAD-ON COLLISION** at (9, 4).\n*   LEFT (8, 5): Safe. Good position to target (8, 6) or (8, 4).\n*   RIGHT (10, 5): Off board. **FATAL.**\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment:**\n\nThe only immediate collision risk is if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (9, 4) and I move UP to (9, 4).\n\nWhy would Snake #1 move DOWN?\n*   It would be moving away from the higher apples (9, 7, 9, 8).\n*   It would be moving toward my head (9, 3).\n*   It's a defensive/blocking move, but not an apple-eating move.\n\nWhy would Snake #1 move UP or LEFT?\n*   UP (9, 6) targets (9, 7) next turn. Strong move.\n*   LEFT (8, 5) targets (8, 6) or (8, 4) next turn. Strong move.\n\nGiven Snake #1's high score and length, it is likely prioritizing apple acquisition. Moving UP or LEFT serves this purpose. Moving DOWN is highly unlikely as it risks a collision without reward, unless the AI is specifically programmed to block. Since the board is quite open and apples are available nearby, the rational move for Snake #1 is UP or LEFT.\n\nI will assume the enemy acts rationally to maximize its score and does not intentionally target a non-reward collision (moving away from apples). Therefore, moving UP to (9, 4) is relatively low risk and necessary for apple acquisition.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move UP to (9, 4). (Current move)\n2. Move UP to (9, 5). (If Snake 1 has moved away)\n3. Move UP to (9, 6) or LEFT if (9, 7) is already blocked by Snake #1.\nThe ultimate goal is to secure (9, 7) and (9, 8).\n\nUP",

Apples collected: 1.\nEnemy Snake #1 is at head (9, 6). Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length 7. Apples collected: 6.\n\nApples remaining: (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 6), (8, 4), (7, 7).\n\nMy primary goal remains securing the high-value apple cluster along the Y=9 wall, specifically (9, 7) and (9, 8). Snake #1 is currently one cell above me and slightly closer to those apples.\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 9, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (9, 5) is part of Snake #1's body [(9, 5)]. **FATAL.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 3):** Moves onto my body (9, 3). **FATAL** (Moving backwards).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* The cell (8, 4) contains an apple. Safe if no head collision.\n    *   *Strategic:* Eating this apple immediately brings me up to 2 apples and increases my length, which is crucial for competing with Snake #1. This is a very strong option and shifts my focus slightly inward from the wall.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 4):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nOnly one safe move remains: LEFT to (8, 4).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis (at 9, 6):**\nSnake #1 is currently at (9, 6). It is highly likely targeting (9, 7) or (9, 8), or perhaps turning inward towards (8, 6).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (9, 6):\n*   UP (9, 7): Hits apple (9, 7). Very strong move.\n*   DOWN (9, 5): Moves onto its own body (9, 5). **FATAL** (Moving backwards).\n*   LEFT (8, 6): Hits apple (8, 6). Strong move.\n*   RIGHT (10, 6): Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nSnake #1 must move UP to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 6). Both moves involve eating an apple.\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment (My move LEFT to 8, 4):**\n\n*   My intended target is (8, 4).\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (9, 7), or LEFT to (8, 6), there is no collision risk with me at (8, 4).\n*   Since neither of Snake #1's likely moves sends it near (8, 4), moving LEFT is entirely safe and results in an apple gain.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move LEFT to (8, 4) is the only viable safe move and has the immediate benefit of securing an apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (8, 4) and eat the apple. (Current move)\n2. If Snake #1 has moved UP to (9, 7), my new head position (8, 4) is adjacent to two apples: (8, 6) (if Snake 1 didn't go there) and (7, 7). I will analyze positioning relative to Snake #1's expanded body and the remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)]. Length 8. Apples collected: 7.\n*Note: Snake #1 moved UP in the last turn to (9, 7) and ate the target apple. My prediction that it would move UP or LEFT was correct.*\n\nApples remaining: (9, 8), (8, 6), (7, 7), (3, 4), (7, 9).\n\nThe board is open around me, but Snake #1 is long and dominating the right side. I need to continue growing and securing apples where Snake #1 is less likely to go immediately.\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 8, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 5):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (8, 5) is occupied by Snake #1's body. **FATAL.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (8, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves away from the cluster of nearby apples (8, 6) and (7, 7). Less preferred unless forced.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (7, 4) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves me closer to the center, away from Snake #1's massive body on the right edge. It leads towards apple (3, 4).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 4):** Moves onto my body (9, 4). **FATAL** (Moving backwards).\n\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN (8, 3) and LEFT (7, 4).\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves Strategically:**\n\nMy closest apples are (8, 6) and (7, 7). Both are relatively close to Snake #1's current head: (9, 7).\n\n*   If I move **LEFT to (7, 4)**: I aim for the long-term goal of reaching (3, 4). This move keeps my options open and moves me away from the body of Snake #1, which occupies (7, 5) and (8, 5).\n    *   From (7, 4), I would typically aim UP next turn to (7, 5) or LEFT again. Moving UP to (7, 5) is **FATAL** (Snake #1 body). I would be forced LEFT or DOWN.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN to (8, 3)**: This seems defensive and allows Snake #1 to monopolize the top-right quadrant. While safe, it doesn't help me catch up in score.\n\nGiven the cluster of Snake #1's body at (8, 5), (7, 5), and (6, 5), attempting to go UP towards (8, 6) or (7, 7) is extremely risky/impossible right now without predicting Snake #1's movement perfectly or waiting for its tail to clear.\n\n**Predicting Enemy Snake #1's Move (at 9, 7):**\nSnake #1 just ate an apple and is 8 segments long.\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** Hits apple (9, 8). Very strong move, increases score/length.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):** Moves onto its own body (9, 6). **FATAL** (Moving backward).\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Cell (8, 7) is empty. Strategic move to pivot inward, perhaps aiming for (8, 6) or (7, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nSnake #1 will most likely move UP to (9, 8) to secure the immediately available apple, or LEFT to pivot.\n\n**Collision/Trapping Risk:**\n\n1.  If I move **LEFT to (7, 4)**: No immediate collision risk. This move positions me to move LEFT again towards (3, 4) or DOWN, or try to wait for Snake #1 to clear some space. Since I cannot move UP to (7, 5), this line is somewhat restrictive, but it is necessary to avoid the bulk of Snake #1.\n2.  If I move **DOWN to (8, 3)**: Safe, but extremely passive.\n\nI need to secure apples. (3, 4) is a guarantee if I commit to moving left. (7, 7) and (8, 6) are contentious. Since Snake #1 is likely going for (9, 8), I can try to intercept (8, 6) or (7, 7) later, but for now, moving inward and away from their body mass is safest.\n\nThe move LEFT (7, 4) seems best as it maintains forward progress toward a distant, less contested apple (3, 4), while safely navigating away from the cluster of Snake #1's body.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (7, 4).\n2. If safe, move LEFT again towards apple (3, 4). Alternatively, try to wrap around Snake #1's tail if it retracts.\n\nLEFT\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n**Turn: 22 / 150**\n\n**Goal:** Continue growing safely, preferably by securing uncontested apples, as Snake #1 is significantly longer (Length 8 vs my Length 3) and dominating the valuable top-right corner.\n\n**Position:** ID 0 Head at (8, 4). Snake #1 Head at (9, 7).\n\n**Restricted Options:**\n1. UP (8, 5) is occupied by Snake #1's body. FATAL.\n2. RIGHT (9, 4) is my own body. FATAL.\n\n**Safe Options Remaining:** DOWN (8, 3) and LEFT (7, 4).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is likely moving UP to (9, 8), eating another apple. This means the top-right quadrant remains highly contested/blocked by its long body.\n\n*   Moving DOWN (8, 3) is overly defensive and cedes the board.\n*   Moving LEFT (7, 4) starts a path toward the isolated apple at (3, 4). This move is safe and distances my snake from the dense body segments of Snake #1 (at 8, 5 and 7, 5).\n\nAlthough moving LEFT limits my immediate options (e.g., I cannot move UP to (7, 5) next turn due to Snake #1's body), it establishes control over a safe, less contested area of the board and provides a clear path to an apple. This is the optimal long-term survival and growth strategy given the current enemy configuration.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

My previous defensive move (DOWN to (7, 3)) was successful in surviving the pinch, and now I need to break left towards the cluster of apples at (3, 4) and (3, 6).\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 7, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (7, 4) is occupied by my own body (the neck segment). **FATAL.**\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (7, 2) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves further away from all apples, which is suboptimal, but ensures maximum safety and distance from Snake #1.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (6, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* This is the optimal direction, as it starts breaking towards the central-left apples ((3, 4) and (3, 6)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (8, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Keeps me in the right-hand area, which is currently heavily influenced by Snake #1.

(7, 7) is also nearby.\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 8):** Safe, moves towards (7, 7) or (7, 9).\n*   **RIGHT (to 9, 8):** Moves onto its own body (9, 8). **FATAL.**\nSnake #1 is likely going to continue high, perhaps moving UP to (8, 9) or DOWN/LEFT to secure (8, 6) or (7, 7). No matter which path it takes, its expected movements are far away from my planned move to (6, 3).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (6, 3) is the best strategic option. It is safe, allows me to reposition towards the uncontested side of the board, and sets me up to eventually collect (3, 4) and (3, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next Few Turns):**\n1. Move LEFT to (6, 3) (Current move).\n2. From (6, 3), I should continue moving LEFT. The next steps would be (5, 3), (4, 3), and then adjusting UP/DOWN to aim for (3, 4) or (3, 6).

Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]. Length 10.\nApples remaining: (8, 6), (3, 4), (7, 9), (3, 6), (9, 2).\n\nI successfully moved LEFT to (4, 3). My primary targets are still the apples on the left side: (3, 4) and (3, 6).\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves for ID 0 (at 4, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 4):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (4, 4) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* This move positions me perfectly to turn LEFT next turn to reach (3, 4) or continue UP towards (3, 6). It is the ideal approach to the apples.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 2):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (4, 2) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves away from all target apples. Suboptimal.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (3, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves closer in X, but requires a subsequent move UP (to 3, 4) to eat the apple. Moving UP now to (4, 4) is more direct for setting up the Apple capture.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 3):**\n    *   *Safety:* Cell (5, 3) is occupied by my own body (the neck segment). **FATAL.**\n\n**Prioritization of Safe Moves:** UP > LEFT > DOWN.\n\n**Analyzing the best move (UP to 4, 4):**\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 4):\n*   Next turn (T28), I can move LEFT to (3, 4) and eat the apple. Ideal.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 3):\n*   I am safe, but I am one cell further down than necessary. To eat (3, 4) on T28, I would have to move UP. This is a possibility, but (4, 4) feels slightly better for general access to the left side and wall area if needed.\n\n**Considering Snake #1 (at 6, 7):**\nSnake #1 is centralized on the right side. It is likely still targeting (7, 9) or (8, 6).\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (6, 7):\n*   UP (to 6, 8): Safe.\n*   DOWN (to 6, 6): Safe.\n*   LEFT (to 5, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 7, 7): Hits body segment (7, 7). **FATAL.** Wait, the body segment is (7, 7) right behind the head (6, 7). This appears wrong based on the provided list where head is (6, 7) and neck is (7, 7). Snake 1 must have moved LEFT this turn (T27) from (7, 7) to (6, 7).\n\nLet's re-examine Snake 1's listing: Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), ...].\nThis means moving RIGHT to (7, 7) is hitting its own neck. So RIGHT is FATAL for Snake #1.\n\nSnake #1 must choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP (6, 8) or LEFT (5, 7), it moves away from the priority apples (7, 9) and (8, 6).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN (6, 6), it sets up for (8, 6) or maybe (3, 6) path later, but is still far from my target area.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake #1 will pursue one of the eastern apples, perhaps aiming for (8, 6) by moving DOWN/RIGHT over the next few turns, or maybe trying to loop back UP towards (7, 9) through (6, 8).\n\nRegardless, Snake #1 is far from me, and my move UP to (4, 4) is safe and optimal for reaching the (3, 4) apple next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move UP to (4, 4) (Current move).\n2. T28: Move LEFT to (3, 4) (Eat apple).\n3. T29: Move UP to (3, 5).\n4. T30: Move UP to (3, 6) (Eat apple).\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   *Strategic:* Moves towards (3, 6) but away from the immediately reachable (3, 4).

It is situated between two apples: (8, 6) and (3, 6).\nPossible safe moves for Snake #1: UP (to 6, 7 - into body), DOWN (to 6, 5 - safe), LEFT (to 5, 6 - safe), RIGHT (to 7, 6 - safe, near apple).\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (7, 6), it aims for (8, 6). This is the most likely offensive move.\n*   The head of Snake #1 is far from my current target (3, 4). There is no collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion for ID 0:**\nMoving LEFT to (3, 4) is perfectly safe and allows me to consume an apple, increasing my score and length.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T29+):**\n1.  T28: Move LEFT to (3, 4) (Eat A). Head is at (3, 4), I grow to length 4.\n2.  T29: Continue movement up/left toward (3, 6). From (3, 4), UP to (3, 5) or (3, 6) if the latter is free and safe.
