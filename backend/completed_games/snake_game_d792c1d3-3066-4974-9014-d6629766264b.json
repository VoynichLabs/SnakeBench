I have 2 apples.\n- Apples: (3,9), (9,7), (5,3), (2,4), (5,4)\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (1,4), body at (0,4) and (0,3). They have 2 apples.\n\n**Available moves from (5,6):**\n- UP: (5,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (5,5) - empty\n- LEFT: (4,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: (6,6) - my own body segment (would die)\n\nRIGHT is immediately fatal (moving into my own body at (6,6)), so it is eliminated.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP (5,7): Moves toward apples at (3,9) and (9,7). From (5,7), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (but not DOWN back to (5,6) as it would be backwards into my body? Actually, after moving UP, my body will be at (5,6) and (6,6), so DOWN from (5,7) would be safe as it goes to (5,6) which is now empty? Wait, no: after moving, the head moves first and then the body follows. So if I move UP to (5,7), the next state will be: head at (5,7), then the first body segment moves to (5,6) (old head), and the tail moves to (6,6). So (5,6) becomes a body segment. Therefore, from (5,7), DOWN to (5,6) would be fatal (into my own body). So from (5,7), safe moves would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- DOWN (5,5): Moves toward apples at (5,3) and (2,4). From (5,5), safe moves would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP would go back to (5,6) which is now a body segment? Similarly, after moving DOWN, the body will be at (5,6) and (6,6), so UP from (5,5) to (5,6) is fatal). So from (5,5), safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- LEFT (4,6): Moves away from the cluster of apples but is safe. From (4,6), safe moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT to (5,6) is fatal as it is now a body segment). So LEFT gives me three options: UP to (4,7), DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6).\n\nAlso note the apple at (5,4) is directly below me. If I go DOWN to (5,5), I am one step away from (5,4). Similarly, the apple at (5,3) is two steps down.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,4) and might be heading for the apple at (2,4) or (5,4). They could move RIGHT to (2,4) to get the apple, or DOWN to (1,3), or UP to (1,5), etc. They have multiple options.\n\nMy immediate goal should be to collect apples safely. The closest apple is at (5,4) which is directly below me. So DOWN to (5,5) puts me adjacent to it. Then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,4) to eat it.\n\nAlternatively, going DOWN also moves me toward (5,3) and (2,4).\n\nGoing UP moves me toward distant apples (3,9) and (9,7), which are far and might be contested later.\n\nGoing LEFT is safe but doesn't directly lead to any apple quickly.\n\nSo DOWN seems best to get the apple at (5,4) quickly.\n\nAlso, from (5,5), I have three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) which is good for flexibility.\n\nEnemy snake #1 might also be heading for (2,4) or (5,4). But they are at (1,4), so they can get to (2,4) in one move (RIGHT) or to (1,5) (UP) or (1,3) (DOWN). They might choose RIGHT to (2,4) to eat the apple there. But that doesn't directly conflict with me going to (5,4).\n\nSo DOWN is safe and leads to immediate apple collection next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,5), next turn I can go DOWN to (5,4) to eat the apple. That will grow my snake to 4 segments (head, then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)). Then from (5,4), I can consider moving to other apples like (5,3) or (2,4) or even UP later. I should be cautious of enemy snake #1 who might be competing for (2,4). But I have a longer body and more options.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, enemy moves this turn, so next turn enemy head could be at (4,4) if they go LEFT, or (5,3) if they go DOWN, etc. If enemy goes LEFT to (4,4) this turn, I die in head-on collision if I go RIGHT. So RIGHT is risky.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy likely wants apple at (5,3) \u2192 DOWN from (5,4) to (5,3) is probable. That\u2019s safe for me. But if enemy chooses LEFT to (4,4), my RIGHT move kills us both.  \nGiven enemy just ate and may avoid risk, but can\u2019t be sure. Safer to avoid RIGHT if possible.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (3,3) avoids possible head-on collision, gets me closer to apple (5,3), and leaves 2 safe moves next turn.  \nUP is safe but moves away from nearest apple.  \nRIGHT is risky due to possible head-on.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,3), move toward apple (5,3) via RIGHT (4,3) or DOWN (3,2) to approach from below, depending on enemy position.  \n\nDOWN",

I will grow by one segment (so my body becomes: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)). After eating, the apple at (5,3) will be removed. This increases my score to 4 and length to 5.\n- LEFT (4,4): Moves away from the apples but is safe. From (4,4), I can go UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4), or RIGHT to (5,4) (which is now empty). However, LEFT moves me closer to the enemy snake #1 at (3,4). They might move in any direction, but if they move RIGHT to (4,4) this turn, we would have a head-on collision (both moving into same cell) and both die. So LEFT is risky due to potential collision.\n- RIGHT (6,4): Safe and moves me away from the enemy. From (6,4), I can go UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), RIGHT to (7,4), or LEFT to (5,4) (which is now empty). This doesn't immediately lead to an apple but keeps options open.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,4).

They can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. If they move RIGHT to (4,4), and I move LEFT to (4,4), we collide and both die. Therefore, LEFT is dangerous.\n\nDOWN is safe and collects an apple. It also avoids the enemy.\n\nRIGHT is safe but doesn't collect an apple.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the best move to gain an apple and avoid risk.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,3) and eating the apple, I will have 4 apples and a length of 5. Next turn, from (5,3), I can consider moving DOWN to (5,2) (if safe) or other directions. The apples at (9,7) and (9,6) are far, but (0,9) and (3,9) are also options. I should start moving toward the top row where there are multiple apples. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,4) and might be heading upward as well. I need to be cautious of collisions and plan a route to avoid getting trapped.\n\nDOWN",

From (6,4), I can go UP to (6,5), LEFT to (5,4) (my body? but body will move), or RIGHT to (7,4). This is safe and progresses toward the closest apple (6,8).\n- DOWN (6,2): Moves downward into an empty area. From (6,2), I can go DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), or RIGHT to (7,2). This is safe but moves away from apples.\n- RIGHT (7,3): Moves rightward. From (7,3), I can go UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), or RIGHT to (8,3). This is safe and might be a step toward the apples on the right (9,7) and (9,6), but it's farther than (6,8).\n\nThe apple at (6,8) is very close (only 4 moves away: UP to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)). Moving UP is directly toward it.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,2). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (3,3) - their own body (would die)\n- DOWN: (3,1) - empty\n- LEFT: (2,2) - empty\n- RIGHT: (4,2) - empty\nSo they cannot move UP. They can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They are not an immediate threat to me since they are far away (3 cells horizontally and 1 vertically).\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to efficiently reach the apple at (6,8). It is safe and progresses toward a goal.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (6,4), continue moving UP to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), and then (6,8) to eat the apple. After that, consider moving right toward (9,7) or (9,6) or even (0,9) if safe. Avoid the enemy snake #1 which is on the left. They might be heading down or left, so keep distance.\n\nUP",

I have 4 apples.\n- Apples at: (3,9), (9,7), (9,6), (0,9), (6,8)\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (1,3), body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]. They have 3 apples.\n\n**Available moves from (6,6):**\n- UP: (6,7) - empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (6,5) - my own body (would die)\n- LEFT: (5,6) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - empty (safe)\n\nDOWN is immediately fatal (moving into my own body). So UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP (6,7): Moves directly toward the apple at (6,8). This is the closest apple and should be prioritized. From (6,7), I can then move UP to (6,8) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe.\n- LEFT (5,6): Moves away from the apple at (6,8) and into a less dense area. This might be useful for other apples later (like (0,9)), but it is not efficient for the closest apple.\n- RIGHT (7,6): Also moves away from (6,8) and toward the right side where there are apples at (9,7) and (9,6). However, these are farther than (6,8).\n\nThe apple at (6,8) is only 1 move away (UP to (6,7), then (6,8)). Moving UP is crucial to reach it quickly.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,3). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4) - empty\n- DOWN: (1,2) - their own body (would die)\n- LEFT: (0,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - empty\nSo they cannot move DOWN. They are far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to efficiently reach the apple at (6,8). It is safe and progresses toward the goal.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (6,7), next turn move UP to (6,8) to eat the apple. Then, consider moving right toward (9,7) or (9,6) or even (0,9) if safe. Avoid the enemy snake #1 which is on the left. They might be heading up or left, so keep distance.\n\nUP",

So UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP (6,8): This cell has an apple.

I now have 5 apples.\n- Apples at: (3,9), (9,7), (9,6), (0,9), (2,1)\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (1,5), body: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] (they moved UP last turn to (1,5)).\n\n**Available moves from (6,8):**\n- UP: (6,9) - empty and within board (safe)\n- DOWN: (6,7) - my own body (would die)\n- LEFT: (5,8) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - empty (safe)\n\nDOWN is immediately fatal (moving into my own body). So UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP (6,9): Moves toward the top edge. There is an apple at (3,9) to the left, but that is far and near the enemy. Also, moving UP might limit future options if I get too close to the top wall.\n- LEFT (5,8): Moves left. There is an apple at (3,9) but also enemy snake #1 is in the left area (head at (1,5)). Moving left might bring me closer to conflict.\n- RIGHT (7,8): Moves right toward the apples at (9,7) and (9,6). This seems promising as there are two apples in that direction and no enemy nearby.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,5). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (1,6) - empty\n- DOWN: (1,4) - their own body (would die)\n- LEFT: (0,5) - empty\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - empty\nSo they cannot move DOWN. They are likely to move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. They are far away (left side) and not an immediate threat to me on the right.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (7,8) is the best choice. It moves me toward multiple apples (9,7) and (9,6) and avoids the enemy. It also keeps my options open: from (7,8), I can go UP to (7,9), RIGHT to (8,8), or DOWN to (7,7) (but note my body is below, so DOWN might be risky next turn? Actually, my body is at (6,7) and (6,6) etc., so (7,7) is currently empty). So multiple safe moves will be available.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,8), next turn I should continue rightward toward the apples at (9,7) and (9,6). For example, from (7,8), I can go RIGHT to (8,8) or DOWN to (7,7) (to approach (9,6) which is at y=6) or UP to (7,9) (to approach (9,7) which is at y=7). I should avoid moving left back into the center or toward the enemy. Prioritize eating the apples on the right.\n\nRIGHT",

This minimizes the number of moves to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, DOWN to (8,7) is also good, but it takes an extra move to get to (9,7) (I need to go RIGHT next turn). So RIGHT is faster.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

So only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- DOWN (9,7): This moves me directly onto an apple.

This is safe but doesn't get me an apple immediately. From (9,9), next turn I could only go LEFT (to (8,9)) or DOWN (to (9,8)), which is my current position. This is a dead-end and risky for future moves.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,8). Their possible moves:\n- UP: (1,9) - empty\n- DOWN: (1,7) - their own body (would die)\n- LEFT: (0,8) - empty\n- RIGHT: (2,8) - empty\nSo they cannot move DOWN.

So only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- DOWN (9,6): This moves me directly onto an apple. Eating it would grow me further. This is highly beneficial. However, after moving DOWN, my head will be at (9,6), which is the bottom-right corner? Wait, note coordinates: (9,6) is near the right edge (x=9) and y=6. From (9,6), next moves would be limited: UP to (9,7) (which is my body), LEFT to (8,6) (which might be safe), or DOWN to (9,5) (safe). So it's not a dead-end immediately, but it restricts options.\n- LEFT (8,7): This moves me away from the edge. From (8,7), I have more options: UP (8,8) is my body? Actually, (8,8) is my body segment (second segment). So UP is not safe. DOWN (8,6) is empty. LEFT (7,7) is empty. RIGHT (9,7) is my body. So from (8,7), only DOWN and LEFT are safe. This is still better than being at (9,6).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,8).

They are far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should prioritize eating the apple at (9,6) by moving DOWN. This gives me an immediate point and grows my snake. However, I must be cautious about getting trapped in the corner. After eating, I will be at (9,6) with an even longer body. Then I can only move LEFT (to (8,6)) or DOWN (to (9,5)) to avoid my body. So I need to plan an escape route.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (8,7) avoids the apple but keeps me in a more open area. However, since apples are important for winning (I have 6, enemy has 3), I should eat as many as possible safely.\n\nGiven that the enemy is far and I have a lead, I should take the apple. Moving DOWN is safe and beneficial.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN to eat the apple at (9,6).\n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s check: after growth, body at turn 21: head (0, 9), body: (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6). If I go RIGHT to (1, 9), new body: [(1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)] length 6. Then from (1, 9) next turn: UP off board, DOWN (1, 8) body, LEFT (0, 9) body, RIGHT (2, 9) empty \u2192 only RIGHT safe again. That\u2019s a corridor along top edge\u2014dangerous.  \n\nBut if I go DOWN to (0, 7), next turn only DOWN to (0, 6), then only DOWN to (0, 5), etc.\u2014trapped along left edge with no apples nearby.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gets apple and growth, which is valuable for score and eventual win condition (30 apples). Even though next turn only RIGHT is safe, that\u2019s better than DOWN which also has 1 safe move but no apple. After going RIGHT to (1, 9), I\u2019ll be at top edge but can try to move rightwards toward other apples (3, 9) or (9, 6) while enemy is far.  \n\nEnemy is on right side and may go for (9, 6) apple, moving away from me.  \n\nI choose **UP** to eat apple now and deal with the tight path next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (0, 9), go RIGHT to (1, 9). Then from (1, 9), go RIGHT to (2, 9) if safe, moving toward (3, 9) apple. Avoid going back left into body. Keep checking enemy\u2019s position\u2014if enemy moves toward top right, I may need to go down from (2, 9) to (2, 8) etc.  \n\nUP",

Wait, last move I moved DOWN from (9,7) to (9,6) and ate the apple there. So now I have grown by one segment. The body list is updated: head at (9,6), then previous head (9,7) becomes first body segment, and so on, with the tail still at (6,6) but now I have an extra segment at the end? Actually, the body provided is [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)] which is 7 segments. Since I had 7 apples before and just ate one, I now have 8 apples, but the body length should be 8 segments (head + 7 body segments). The given body has 7 segments, so it might be correct: head at (9,6) and 7 body segments, total length 8.\n\nApples at: (3,9), (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (8,1)  [Note: (9,6) was eaten last turn, so removed]\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (0,9), body: [(0,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]\n\n**Available moves from (9,6):**\n- UP: (9,7) - my own body (would die)\n- DOWN: (9,5) - empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (8,6) - empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: off board (would die)\n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- DOWN (9,5): moves me down along the right edge. From (9,5), next moves: UP to (9,6) (my body), DOWN to (9,4) (safe), LEFT to (8,5) (safe). So two safe options.\n- LEFT (8,6): moves me away from the edge. From (8,6), next moves: UP to (8,7) (empty), DOWN to (8,5) (empty), LEFT to (7,6) (empty), RIGHT to (9,6) (my body). So three safe options.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (0,9). Their possible moves:\n- UP: off board (die)\n- DOWN: (0,8) - their own body (die)\n- LEFT: off board (die)\n- RIGHT: (1,9) - empty? Actually, the board shows at (1,9) there is nothing? From the board state: row 9 has \"1 . . A . . . . . .\", so (1,9) is empty. So they can only move RIGHT to (1,9) (safe). They have no other options. So they will move RIGHT to (1,9).\n\nApples: The closest apple to me is at (8,1) which is far. Others are (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (3,9). (3,9) is near the enemy? Enemy is at (0,9) moving to (1,9), so they might go towards (3,9) eventually.\n\nLong-term: I should avoid getting trapped in the corner. Moving LEFT to (8,6) gives me more freedom and opens up the center. Moving DOWN to (9,5) keeps me along the edge, which is riskier.\n\nSince I have a lead (8 apples vs enemy 4), I should prioritize safety and maintaining options. Moving LEFT is better for future flexibility.\n\n**Final decision:**\nLEFT to (8,6).\n\nLEFT",

They have 4 apples.\n\n**Available moves from my head (8,6):**\n- UP: (8,7) - currently empty (safe)\n- DOWN: (8,5) - currently empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (7,6) - currently empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (9,6) - my own body (would die)\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 (head at (1,9)) possible moves:**\n- UP: (1,10) - off board (die)\n- DOWN: (1,8) - its own body (die)\n- LEFT: (0,9) - its own body (die)\n- RIGHT: (2,9) - empty (safe) - only option\n\nSo enemy will move RIGHT to (2,9).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Apples: The closest apple to me is (8,1) at distance |8-8| + |6-1| = 0+5=5. Others are farther: (2,1) (distance 6+5=11), (0,0) (8+6=14), (0,3) (8+3=11), (3,9) (5+3=8). So (8,1) is the most reachable.\n- Moving DOWN (8,5) gets me closer to (8,1) (now distance 4) and also opens paths to other apples.\n- Moving LEFT (7,6) moves me away from the right edge but doesn't significantly reduce distance to apples.\n- Moving UP (8,7) moves me away from (8,1) and towards the top, but there is an apple at (3,9) which is far.\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- From (8,5): next moves could be DOWN to (8,4) (closer to (8,1)), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT to (9,5) (but (9,5) is safe? Currently empty, but my body is at (9,6) and (9,7) etc., so (9,5) should be safe).\n- From (7,6): next moves could be DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), UP to (7,7), RIGHT to (8,6) (my body, so not safe).\n- From (8,7): next moves could be UP to (8,8) (my body), DOWN to (8,6) (my body), LEFT to (7,7), RIGHT to (9,7) (my body). So only LEFT is safe? That would trap me.\n\nSo moving UP (8,7) is risky because it leaves only one safe move next (LEFT to (7,7)), which might lead to dead ends. Moving DOWN (8,5) gives more options and moves towards the apple. Moving LEFT (7,6) also gives good options.\n\nGiven that (8,1) is the closest apple, moving DOWN is beneficial. Also, enemy is moving to (2,9), so they are going towards (3,9) apple, which is fine.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead towards the apple at (8,1) by moving down along the right column (x=8) to y=1. This path is currently clear. Avoid moving up into crowded areas. Keep an eye on enemy #1; they are on the top left and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN to (8,5) to get closer to the apple and maintain flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 0): Head at (8,5), body segments: [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)] (length 8 segments including head). I have 7 apples collected.\n- Apples at: (3,9), (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (8,1)\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (2,9), body: [(1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (1,8)] (length 5 segments including head). They have 4 apples.\n\n**Available moves from my head (8,5):**\n- UP: (8,6) - my own body (would die)\n- DOWN: (8,4) - currently empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (7,5) - currently empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - currently empty (safe)\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. UP is unsafe.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 (head at (2,9)) possible moves:**\n- UP: (2,10) - off board (die)\n- DOWN: (2,8) - empty (safe)\n- LEFT: (1,9) - its own body (die)\n- RIGHT: (3,9) - apple (safe) and they might go for it.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,9). They will likely choose RIGHT to (3,9) to get the apple.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The closest apple to me is (8,1) at distance |8-8| + |5-1| = 0+4=4. Others are farther: (2,1) (6+4=10), (0,0) (8+5=13), (0,3) (8+2=10), (3,9) (5+4=9).\n- Moving DOWN (8,4) gets me closer to (8,1) (distance becomes 3) and is safe.\n- Moving LEFT (7,5) moves me away from the right edge but doesn't reduce distance to (8,1) significantly.\n- Moving RIGHT (9,5) is safe but also doesn't help much with (8,1).\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\n- From (8,4): next moves could be DOWN to (8,3) (closer to (8,1)), LEFT to (7,4), or RIGHT to (9,4). All should be safe currently.\n- From (7,5): next moves could be DOWN to (7,4), LEFT to (6,5), UP to (7,6) (empty), RIGHT to (8,5) (my body? But I moved, so it might be safe? Actually, after moving, my body will shift: head moves to new position, tail moves one? Actually, when not eating an apple, the tail moves so the body follows. So (8,5) will become my body next turn? Actually, no: if I move without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail is removed. So the body segments shift: the old head becomes the next segment, and the last segment (tail) is removed. So after moving to (7,5), my body will be [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)]? Actually, the current body is [(8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8)]. After moving without eating, the new body becomes [old head] + body without the tail. So if I move to (7,5), new body is [(8,5) (the old head) + the first 6 segments of the current body: (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)]? Actually, the tail (6,8) is removed. So the new body is 7 segments long: [ (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8) ].\n- Similarly, for DOWN to (8,4): new body would be [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)].\n- For RIGHT to (9,5): new body would be [(8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8)].\n\nSo in all cases, the new body will include (8,5) as the first segment. Therefore, next turn, (8,5) will be my body.\n\nNow, check follow-up moves:\n- From (8,4): next moves would be to (8,3), (7,4), (9,4). (8,5) is body, so UP is not safe. But DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n- From (7,5): next moves to (7,4), (6,5), (7,6), (8,5) (body, so not safe). So three safe moves.\n- From (9,5): next moves to (9,4), (8,5) (body), (9,6) (body? Actually, (9,6) is in the new body? Yes, it is the third segment. So not safe), (10,5) off board. So only (9,4) is safe? That is risky.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (9,5) is bad because it leaves only one safe move next (DOWN to (9,4)), which might lead to dead ends. Moving LEFT to (7,5) gives three safe moves. Moving DOWN to (8,4) gives three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and gets me closer to the apple at (8,1).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving down along x=8 to reach the apple at (8,1). This path is clear. Avoid moving right into confined spaces. The enemy is going for the apple at (3,9), so they are not a threat to me currently.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN to (8,4) to get closer to the apple and maintain flexibility.\n\nDOWN",

I have 7 apples.\n**Enemy snake (ID 1):** Head at (3,8). Body segments: [(3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8)]. They have 5 apples.\n**Apples:** (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (8,1), (1,1)\n\n**Available moves from my head (8,3):**\n- UP: (8,4) - my own body (would die)\n- DOWN: (8,2) - empty and safe\n- LEFT: (7,3) - empty and safe\n- RIGHT: (9,3) - empty and safe\n\nSo UP is unsafe. DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 (head at (3,8)) possible moves:**\n- UP: (3,9) - its own body (die)\n- DOWN: (3,7) - empty and safe\n- LEFT: (2,8) - empty and safe\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - empty and safe\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They are not an immediate threat due to distance.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- The closest apple is (8,1) at Manhattan distance |8-8| + |3-1| = 0+2 = 2. Others are farther: (1,1) (7+2=9), (2,1) (6+2=8), (0,0) (8+3=11), (0,3) (8+0=8).\n- Moving DOWN to (8,2) gets me closer to (8,1) (distance becomes 1) and is safe.\n- Moving LEFT to (7,3) moves me away from the apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,3) moves me away from the apple.\n\n**Future moves:**\n- From (8,2): next moves could be DOWN to (8,1) (eat apple), LEFT to (7,2), or RIGHT to (9,2). UP to (8,3) would be my body? Actually, after moving to (8,2), my new body will be [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8)] (tail (8,8) is removed). So (8,3) is my body. Therefore, from (8,2), UP is not safe. But DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n- From (7,3): next moves could be DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), UP to (7,4) (empty), RIGHT to (8,3) (my body). So only three safe moves? Actually, RIGHT is unsafe, so only DOWN, LEFT, UP are safe.\n- From (9,3): next moves could be DOWN to (9,2), LEFT to (8,3) (my body), UP to (9,4) (empty), RIGHT to (10,3) off board. So only DOWN and UP are safe (two moves). This is risky.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (9,3) is bad because it leaves only two safe moves next. Moving LEFT to (7,3) gives three safe moves but moves me away from the apple. Moving DOWN to (8,2) gives three safe moves and gets me closer to the apple at (8,1).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving down to (8,2) and then to (8,1) to eat the apple. This path is clear and safe. Avoid moving right into confined spaces.\n\n**Final decision:**\nDOWN to (8,2) to get closer to the apple and maintain flexibility.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

(0,0) is also left/down. (0,3) is left/up. (3,2) is left/down.\nAll apples are to the left (west) of your current position.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,0) doesn't get you closer to apples, but it is safe.\nMoving LEFT to (7,1) gets you closer to the apples (reduces x-coordinate).\nMoving RIGHT to (9,1) moves you away from apples (increases x-coordinate).\n\nSo LEFT is best for progressing towards apples.\n\nAlso consider future moves:\n- From (7,1): can go LEFT to (6,1) (closer), UP to (7,2) (safe?), DOWN to (7,0) (safe). Good options.\n- From (8,0): can go LEFT to (7,0) (closer), UP to (8,1) (but that is your body?

So after moving DOWN without eating, your body becomes: head at (8,0), then (8,1) (old head), then (8,2), ... up to (9,8) but the last segment (tail) is removed. So (8,1) becomes a body segment. So from (8,0), UP to (8,1) would be lethal. So from (8,0), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe? Actually DOWN is off board. So only LEFT to (7,0) and RIGHT to (9,0). So only two options, and both are horizontal. This is restrictive.\n- From (9,1): can go LEFT to (8,1) (lethal, as it becomes body), UP to (9,2) (empty), DOWN to (9,0) (empty), RIGHT off board.

Specifically:\n- (2,1) is at x=2, y=1 (left and same row)\n- (0,0) is left and down\n- (0,3) is left and up\n- (1,1) is left and same row\n- (3,2) is left and up\n\nMoving LEFT to (5,1) gets you closer to all apples (reduces x-coordinate).\nMoving DOWN to (6,0) moves you closer to (0,0) but slightly away from others.\nMoving UP to (6,2) moves you closer to (3,2) and (0,3) but away from (2,1) and (1,1).\n\nSo LEFT is best for progressing towards the cluster of apples at (2,1) and (1,1).\n\nFuture moves:\n- From (5,1): can go LEFT to (4,1) (closer to apples), UP to (5,2) (safe), DOWN to (5,0) (safe). Good options.\n- From (6,0): can go LEFT to (5,0) (closer), UP to (6,1) (lethal? After moving down, your body shifts: head at (6,0), then (6,1) becomes neck (old head), so (6,1) is body. So UP is lethal. Also RIGHT to (7,0) is empty? But (7,0) is safe? Actually, after move, body: head (6,0), then (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), ... so (7,0) is safe. So from (6,0): LEFT and RIGHT are safe. DOWN is off board.\n- From (6,2): can go LEFT to (5,2) (closer), DOWN to (6,1) (lethal, as it becomes body), UP to (6,3) (safe), RIGHT to (7,2) (safe? (7,2) is empty? After moving up, body: head (6,2), then (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), ... so (7,2) is safe. So from (6,2): LEFT, UP, RIGHT are safe? DOWN is lethal. Actually three safe moves? But RIGHT to (7,2) is safe since it's not body.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (5,1) gives the best future options (three directions) and progresses towards apples.\n\nEnemy snake is at (3,4), which is closer now (distance 3 in x and 3 in y). It might be moving towards apples as well. We should be cautious as we approach the left side. It might come down to compete for (2,1) or (1,1). We are longer (9 vs 6) so we can potentially block it.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left towards the apples at (2,1) and (1,1). Be cautious of enemy snake #1 which is at (3,4) and might move down. We can try to eat (3,2) first if safe, but (2,1) and (1,1) are more direct. After eating, we grow, so plan a path that avoids dead ends. The enemy has 5 apples (shorter than us), so we have an advantage.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Good options.\n- From (5,0): can go LEFT to (4,0) (closer), UP to (5,1) (lethal? After moving down, your body shifts: head at (5,0), then (5,1) becomes neck (old head), so (5,1) is body. So UP is lethal. Also RIGHT to (6,0) is empty? But (6,0) is safe? Actually, after move, body: head (5,0), then (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), ... so (6,0) is safe. So from (5,0): LEFT and RIGHT are safe. DOWN is off board.\n- From (5,2): can go LEFT to (4,2) (closer), DOWN to (5,1) (lethal, as it becomes body), UP to (5,3) (safe), RIGHT to (6,2) (safe? (6,2) is empty? After moving up, body: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), ... so (6,2) is safe. So from (5,2): LEFT, UP, RIGHT are safe? DOWN is lethal.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (4,1) gives the best future options (three directions) and progresses towards apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving left towards the apples at (2,1) and (1,1). Be cautious of enemy snake #1 which is at (3,3) and might move down. We can try to eat (3,2) first if safe, but (2,1) and (1,1) are more direct. After eating, we grow, so plan a path that avoids dead ends. The enemy has 5 apples (shorter than us), so we have an advantage.\n\nBest move: LEFT\n\nLEFT",

LEFT has min distance 4, safer.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple is (3, 2) \u2014 DOWN eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (2, 1) dist 2 from (3, 2), (1, 1) dist 3, (0, 3) dist 4, (0, 0) dist 5.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \nIf DOWN to (3, 2) and eat apple:  \nNew length 7, body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]  \nFrom (3, 2): UP (3, 3) my body (invalid), DOWN (3, 1) empty, LEFT (2, 2) empty, RIGHT (4, 2) empty.  \n\u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf LEFT to (2, 3):  \nFrom (2, 3): UP (2, 4) my body (invalid), DOWN (2, 2) empty, LEFT (1, 3) empty, RIGHT (3, 3) my body (invalid).  \n\u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (4, 3):  \nFrom (4, 3): UP (4, 4) my body (invalid), DOWN (4, 2) empty, LEFT (3, 3) my body (invalid), RIGHT (5, 3) empty.  \n\u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nEating apple is good, but moving DOWN or RIGHT risks head-on collision with enemy if enemy chooses a move that brings it to distance 2 away (possible if enemy moves toward me).  \nLEFT is safest in terms of immediate collision avoidance.  \nHowever, enemy is at (5, 1) \u2014 moving LEFT to (4, 1) would put it at (4, 1) which is 2 from my RIGHT (4, 3) and 2 from my DOWN (3, 2). But enemy doesn\u2019t know my move.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s body extends rightward, it might prefer LEFT/UP/DOWN to avoid its own body.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4, 1), then:  \n- My DOWN (3, 2) is 2 away \u2192 possible collision if enemy goes UP to (4, 2) next? Wait, simultaneous move: this turn enemy chooses from (5, 1). If enemy goes LEFT to (4, 1), and I go DOWN to (3, 2), we don\u2019t collide this turn. Next turn we\u2019d be at (4, 1) and (3, 2) \u2014 distance 2 again, but not same cell.  \n\nActually, head-on collision only if we move into same cell this turn.  \nFor same cell:  \n- My (3, 2) with enemy (5, 1): enemy would need to move DOWN-LEFT? From (5, 1) to (3, 2) impossible in one move.  \n- My (4, 3) with enemy (5, 1): enemy would need to move UP-LEFT? From (5, 1) to (4, 3) impossible in one move.  \nSo no possible same-cell collision this turn.  \n\nBut distance 2 means next turn we could collide if we both move toward each other. That\u2019s a future risk, not immediate death.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nEating apple now is beneficial \u2014 grows me, increases score.  \nLEFT is safe but delays eating.  \nRIGHT is safe but away from apples.  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple and grow.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 2), my length 7. Next turn from (3, 2), avoid UP into body. Prefer LEFT to (2, 2) to approach (2, 1) apple, or DOWN to (3, 1) to stay flexible. Enemy at (5, 1) or (4, 1) etc. \u2014 keep distance.  \n\nDOWN",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 2)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 0)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 1)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1) (enemy body) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy can go to (4, 2), (4, 0), (3, 1).  \n\nMy candidate moves:  \n- DOWN to (3, 1) \u2192 enemy could also go to (3, 1) (LEFT from (4, 1)) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) \u2192 enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 2) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2192 enemy could go UP to (4, 2) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 death.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are risky because enemy could choose same cell this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (2, 1) distance from (3, 2) = |3-2| + |2-1| = 2.  \nFrom (3, 2):  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) \u2192 distance to (2, 1) = 1 next turn.  \n- DOWN to (3, 1) \u2192 distance to (2, 1) = 1 next turn.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2192 farther from (2, 1).  \n\nBut DOWN risks head-on with enemy if enemy goes LEFT.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safe moves after each safe option:**  \nLEFT to (2, 2):  \nFrom (2, 2): UP (2, 3) empty, DOWN (2, 1) apple, LEFT (1, 2) empty, RIGHT (3, 2) my old head? Wait, my body after move: head (2, 2), body = [(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)] \u2192 (3, 2) is my neck, so moving RIGHT into (3, 2) is invalid (my own body). So from (2, 2), valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nRIGHT to (4, 2) is risky (head-on possible), but if we ignore risk for a sec: from (4, 2), UP (4, 3) empty, DOWN (4, 1) enemy head now? Actually enemy may move, but currently (4, 1) is enemy head, so moving DOWN into enemy head\u2019s current cell is only dangerous if enemy stays there \u2014 but enemy moves simultaneously, so (4, 1) will be empty if enemy leaves. But if enemy goes UP to (4, 2), we collide, so RIGHT is dangerous this turn anyway. So eliminate RIGHT.  \n\nDOWN to (3, 1) risky (head-on possible if enemy goes LEFT to (3, 1)).  \n\nSo only definitely safe from head-on collision this turn is LEFT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s possible motives:**  \nEnemy might avoid its own body \u2014 its body extends to the right, so moving LEFT (to (3, 1)) is possible and gets it closer to apples (2, 1), (1, 1). That\u2019s exactly where I might go. So if I go DOWN to (3, 1), enemy might also go LEFT to (3, 1) \u2192 we both die.  \n\nBetter to avoid that risk entirely.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT to (2, 2) is safe from immediate head-on, keeps me close to apple (2, 1) for next turn, and gives 3 safe follow-up moves.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 2), apple at (2, 1) is one move DOWN. Check enemy position then \u2014 if enemy is at (3, 1) or (4, 1), be careful about moving into (2, 1) if enemy could also move there. Prefer to stay flexible, maybe go LEFT to (1, 2) if risky.  \n\nLEFT",

(3,1) is adjacent to enemy head (3,2), but currently empty. However, enemy might move there.\n- RIGHT: to (5,1) - this is your own body (the first segment after head), so lethal.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, consider apples:\nMost apples are to the left (west) of your current position (4,1): (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (1,1). Also (9,3) is far right.\nMoving LEFT to (3,1) gets you closer to (2,1) and (1,1).\nMoving DOWN to (4,0) gets you closer to (0,0).\nMoving UP to (4,2) gets you closer to (0,3) and also (9,3) is far.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,2). It has possible moves: UP to (3,3) (its body), DOWN to (3,1) (empty), LEFT to (2,2) (empty), RIGHT to (4,2) (empty). So it might move DOWN to (3,1) or RIGHT to (4,2). Therefore, moving LEFT to (3,1) risks a head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN. Similarly, moving UP to (4,2) risks collision if enemy moves RIGHT.\n\nWe are longer (9 vs 6), so head-on collision would kill both. We want to avoid that.\n\nSafer options:\n- DOWN to (4,0): no immediate risk from enemy (enemy at (3,2) cannot reach (4,0) in one move). Then we can go LEFT to (3,0) or RIGHT to (5,0) next.\n- UP to (4,2): risk if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,2) same turn.\n- LEFT to (3,1): risk if enemy moves DOWN to (3,1) same turn.\n\nTo avoid potential head-on collision, DOWN seems safest. Also, DOWN moves towards apple (0,0).\n\nFuture moves from (4,0):\n- LEFT to (3,0) (safe, closer to apples)\n- RIGHT to (5,0) (safe)\n- UP to (4,1) (lethal, as it becomes body after move)\nSo two safe options.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving towards the left-side apples. Avoid direct confrontation with enemy since we are longer and can win by attrition. Consider circling to (0,0) then (1,1) and (2,1). Also note apple at (9,3) but it's far and risky due to our body on right.\n\nBest move: DOWN to avoid potential collision and progress towards (0,0).\n\nDOWN",

Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, -1) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can only go LEFT to (3, 0) or RIGHT to (5, 0).  \n\nMy candidate cells:  \n- UP (2, 3): enemy cannot reach in 1 move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n- DOWN (2, 1): enemy cannot reach in 1 move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n- LEFT (1, 2): enemy cannot reach in 1 move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (2, 1) is 1 step DOWN.  \n(1, 1) is also close: from (2, 2), DOWN then LEFT next turn, or LEFT then DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 1)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 8.  \nFrom (2, 1): possible moves next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 my old head? Wait, after moving DOWN to (2, 1), my body becomes: head (2,1), then old head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So (2,2) is my neck \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn. Risk: enemy at (3, 0) or (5, 0) next turn could threaten (2,1)? Not immediately.  \n\n**UP to (2, 3)** \u2013 no apple.  \nFrom (2, 3):  \n- UP (2, 4) empty, DOWN (2, 2) my neck, LEFT (1, 3) empty, RIGHT (3, 3) my body \u2192 so only UP and LEFT safe next turn \u2192 2 safe moves. Worse.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 2)** \u2013 no apple.  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP (1, 3) empty, DOWN (1, 1) apple, LEFT (0, 2) empty, RIGHT (2, 2) my neck \u2192 so 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely moves:**  \nEnemy at (4, 0) can only go LEFT to (3, 0) or RIGHT to (5, 0).  \nFrom (3, 0), it could go UP to (3, 1) next turn, threatening apple (2, 1) area.  \nFrom (5, 0), it\u2019s farther from apples (2,1) and (1,1).  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3, 0), then next turn it could move UP to (3, 1) and be adjacent to (2, 1) and (1, 1). That\u2019s a future risk if I go DOWN now to (2, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gets me an apple now, grows my length, and leaves 3 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT gives no apple but also 3 safe moves next turn.  \nUP gives fewer safe moves.  \n\nGiven enemy is restricted in movement this turn and can\u2019t cause head-on, I should grab the apple at (2, 1) to catch up in score (6 vs 8).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (2, 1) and eating apple, my head at (2, 1), body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), \u2026].  \nNext turn, avoid moving UP into neck (2, 2).  \nCheck enemy position: if enemy at (3, 0), it might go UP to (3, 1) next turn, so moving LEFT to (1, 1) could be contested if enemy goes RIGHT then? Wait, from (3, 0) enemy\u2019s possible moves next turn: UP (3, 1), RIGHT (4, 0) its old head? Actually after enemy moves this turn, its body shifts, so (4, 0) becomes its neck if it moved LEFT to (3, 0). So from (3, 0), valid moves: UP (3, 1), LEFT (2, 0), DOWN invalid (off board), RIGHT (4, 0) invalid (neck). So enemy could go to (3, 1) or (2, 0). If enemy goes to (3, 1), then from my (2, 1), moving LEFT to (1, 1) is safe; moving RIGHT to (3, 1) would be head-on. So I\u2019d avoid RIGHT next turn.  \n\nSafer to take apple now and stay flexible.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 0):\n- Head at (4,0)\n- Body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)] (length 9 including head)\n- Apples collected: 8\n\nApples at: (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (1,1), (9,3)\n\nEnemy snake #1:\n- Head at (2,2)\n- Body: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)]\n- Apples: 6\n\nFrom your head at (4,0), possible moves:\n- UP: to (4,1) - this is your own body (first segment after head), so lethal.\n- DOWN: to (4,-1) - off the board (y=-1), so lethal.\n- LEFT: to (3,0) - empty (from board state: row 0, column 3 is empty).\n- RIGHT: to (5,0) - empty (row 0, column 5 is empty).\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider apples:\nMost apples are to the left (west): (2,1), (0,0), (0,3), (1,1). Also (9,3) is far right.\nMoving LEFT to (3,0) gets you closer to (0,0) and (1,1) and (2,1).\nMoving RIGHT to (5,0) moves you away from the cluster of apples and towards the right side where your body is (which might be risky).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP: to (2,3) - empty? (from board: row 3 has apple at (0,3) and (9,3), but (2,3) is empty).\n- DOWN: to (2,1) - has an apple? Actually (2,1) is an apple location, but currently empty? Wait, the board shows row 1: at (2,1) there is an 'A'? Actually from the board state:\nRow 1: \". A A . T T T T T .\" so column 2 is 'A' (apple) and column 3 is 'A' (apple)? But apples are at (2,1) and (1,1) - so (2,1) is an apple cell. However, when moving onto an apple, it is eaten and removed. So currently (2,1) is empty? Actually the board state is drawn after the last move? But we are at turn 32, and apples are listed as still present. So (2,1) has an apple? The board shows row 1: column 1 is 'A' (apple at (1,1)), column 2 is 'A' (apple at (2,1)), etc. So (2,1) is occupied by an apple. Therefore, enemy moving DOWN to (2,1) would eat the apple and grow.\n- LEFT: to (1,2) - empty.\n- RIGHT: to (3,2) - its own body (first segment after head), so lethal.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,1), it will eat the apple and grow. That would bring it closer to us.\n\nWe are longer (9 vs 6), so we want to avoid head-on collisions? Actually, if we collide head-on, both die. But we are longer, so we might survive if we hit its body? No, head-on collision is when two heads meet.\n\nBut currently, we are at (4,0) and enemy at (2,2). They are not adjacent.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,0) is safe. Next, we can go to (2,0) or (3,1) etc.\nMoving RIGHT to (5,0) is safe, but then we might be trapped by our own body on the right.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to collect the apples on the left. Specifically, (0,0) is very close. From (3,0), we can go LEFT to (2,0) then (1,0) then (0,0) to eat the apple. Then we can go UP to (0,1) and then to (1,1) and (2,1). This is efficient.\n\nEnemy might also be heading for (2,1) apple. But we are at (4,0) and enemy at (2,2). We can reach (0,0) in 3 moves (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT) while enemy needs at least 2 moves to reach (2,1) (e.g., DOWN and then LEFT? Actually from (2,2) to (2,1) is DOWN, then to (1,1) is LEFT). So we have a chance to get multiple apples.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5,0) is less desirable because it leads to a dead-end? Our body is along the top right (columns 5-8, rows 1-4). So moving right might limit our options.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is better.\n\nAlso, consider future moves from (3,0):\n- UP to (3,1): empty? Currently (3,1) is empty (from board row 1: column 3 is '.').\n- DOWN: off board? (3,-1) invalid.\n- LEFT to (2,0): empty.\n- RIGHT to (4,0): but that will be our body after we move? Actually after we move to (3,0), our head is at (3,0) and the old head becomes body at (4,0). So (4,0) becomes body, so RIGHT is lethal.\nSo from (3,0), safe moves are UP and LEFT. Two options.\n\nFrom (5,0) (if we go RIGHT):\n- UP to (5,1): our body (from current body: (5,1) is the second segment).\n- DOWN: off board.\n- LEFT to (4,0): body (old head becomes body).\n- RIGHT to (6,0): empty.\nSo only RIGHT is safe? That is limiting.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is much better for future options.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move LEFT to (3,0), then LEFT to (2,0), then LEFT to (1,0), then LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple. Then UP to (0,1) and then RIGHT to (1,1) to eat next apple. Avoid enemy if possible.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (2,0) gets you closer to (0,0) and (1,1). Moving UP to (3,1) is also closer to (1,1) but slightly farther from (0,0).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (2,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: to (2,2) - its own body (first segment), lethal.\n- DOWN: to (2,0) - empty? But if we move LEFT to (2,0), we might collide head-on?

Actually, head-on collision kills both regardless of length. So we should avoid moving to a cell that enemy might also move to.\n\nSpecifically, if we move LEFT to (2,0), enemy might move DOWN to (2,0) as well. That would be fatal.\n\nIf we move UP to (3,1), enemy might move RIGHT to (3,1) as well? That would also be head-on collision.\n\nSo we need to predict enemy behavior.\n\nEnemy likely wants to eat the apple at (1,1). So it might move LEFT to (1,1). Alternatively, it might avoid us and go RIGHT to (3,1).\n\nBut if enemy moves DOWN to (2,0), it doesn't get an apple and risks collision with us.\n\nGiven that enemy has safe moves to get an apple (LEFT to (1,1)), it is likely to choose that.\n\nTherefore, if we move LEFT to (2,0), enemy is unlikely to choose DOWN (since LEFT is better). So collision risk is low.\n\nSimilarly, if we move UP to (3,1), enemy might choose RIGHT to (3,1) only if it doesn't see a better option. But LEFT to (1,1) is better.\n\nSo both moves are relatively safe.\n\nNow, long-term: We want to collect the apples at (0,0) and (1,1). Moving LEFT to (2,0) sets us up to go to (1,0) then (0,0) to eat the apple. Then we can go UP to (0,1) and then RIGHT to (1,1) to eat the next apple.\n\nMoving UP to (3,1) allows us to go LEFT to (2,1) (but enemy is currently there, so after enemy moves, it might be empty? Enemy might move away). Then to (1,1) to eat the apple. But then we are farther from (0,0).\n\nSo LEFT is better for the apple sequence.\n\nAlso, from (2,0), future moves:\n- UP to (2,1): currently enemy is there, but after enemy moves, it might be empty? But enemy might leave an apple if it eats? Actually (2,1) is not an apple location? Apples are at (0,0), (0,3), (1,1), (9,3), (0,8). So (2,1) is empty. So after enemy moves, (2,1) will be empty (unless enemy leaves a body segment? But enemy grows only when eating an apple).\nEnemy is at (2,1) and has 7 apples, so length 8. If enemy moves LEFT to (1,1) and eats the apple, it will grow to length 9, and its tail will extend? So the cell (2,1) might become body? Actually, when a snake eats an apple, it grows by one segment at the next turn. So the head moves to the new cell, and the tail does not move. So the old head becomes body, and the tail remains. Therefore, if enemy moves from (2,1) to (1,1) and eats, the cell (2,1) becomes body (the first segment). So it will be occupied.\n\nTherefore, if we move to (2,0), then UP to (2,1) might be lethal (enemy body) if enemy moved LEFT.\n\nSo we need to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,0), we can go LEFT to (1,0) then (0,0) to eat apple. Then UP to (0,1). Then to (1,1) might be safe if enemy has already eaten it? But enemy might be there.\n\nGiven the complexity, LEFT is still better because it directly approaches (0,0).\n\nAlso, we are longer than enemy (9 vs 7), so we can be aggressive.\n\nPlan for next turns: Move LEFT to (2,0). Then if enemy is not blocking, move LEFT to (1,0) and then to (0,0) to eat apple. Then proceed to (0,1) and (1,1). Avoid head-on collisions.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

But remember: all snakes move simultaneously. So after movement, this cell might be empty if enemy moves away. However, if enemy stays or moves into it, it could be lethal.\n- DOWN: to (2,-1) - off the board (y=-1), lethal.\n- LEFT: to (1,0) - empty (from board: row 0, column 1 is '.').\n- RIGHT: to (3,0) - your own body (first segment after head), lethal.\n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 at (1,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP: to (1,2) - empty? (row 2, column 1 is '.').\n- DOWN: to (1,0) - empty? (row 0, column 1 is '.').\n- LEFT: to (0,1) - empty? (row 1, column 0 is '.').\n- RIGHT: to (2,1) - currently your body? Actually, (2,1) is enemy's own body (first segment) so lethal for enemy.\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nEnemy likely wants to eat apples. The closest apple is at (0,0) and (0,3). Moving DOWN to (1,0) gets closer to (0,0). Moving LEFT to (0,1) also gets closer to (0,0). Moving UP to (1,2) is away from apples.\n\nSo enemy will probably choose DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,0), enemy might also move DOWN to (1,0) -> head-on collision, both die.\nIf we move UP to (2,1), enemy might not be there since it has safe moves to avoid us.\n\nBut note: if enemy moves DOWN to (1,0), it will be eating the apple at (0,0) soon? Actually (1,0) is not an apple, but it is adjacent to (0,0).\n\nWe are both at 8 apples. So we want to avoid dying.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (1,0), there is a risk that enemy moves DOWN to (1,0) and we collide. But enemy has other options (LEFT to (0,1)) which is also good for apple at (0,0). So enemy might choose LEFT over DOWN? Not necessarily: both are equally good for (0,0).\n\nTo avoid risk, we should move UP to (2,1). Why?\n- After enemy moves, (2,1) will be empty? Because enemy cannot move RIGHT (lethal) and will likely move DOWN or LEFT. So (2,1) becomes safe.\n- From (2,1), we can then go LEFT to (1,1) (which enemy vacated) or UP to (2,2) etc.\n- Also, there is an apple at (0,3) and (3,9) that we can plan for.\n\nMoving UP is safer because it avoids the potential head-on collision at (1,0).\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (2,1), we can go LEFT to (1,1) and then to (0,1) and (0,0) to eat the apple. Or go UP to (2,2) and then LEFT to (1,2) etc. to approach (0,3). We have options.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\nUP",
