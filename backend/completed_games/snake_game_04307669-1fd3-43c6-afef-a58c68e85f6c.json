If enemy moves UP (7,2) or UP-UP (7,3), we might head-on collision if he continues upward. Even worse, if he moves RIGHT (8,1) then UP, we're safe but he could flank. Better avoid going directly toward him.  \n   - UP, LEFT, RIGHT all seem safe for now.\n\n3) **Best aggressive move:**  \n   - UP to (7,9) takes us to the top-right corner. This gives us a defensive position but limits future moves (only 2 directions next turn: LEFT or DOWN).  \n   - LEFT to (6,8) moves us away from enemy and toward the center. We'll have 3 safe directions next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n   - RIGHT to (8,8) goes back to previous spot, which is fine but doesn't advance our position.\n\n   **CHOICE: LEFT to (6,8)** - This moves us AWAY from the direct line of enemy's potential movement (7,1 \u2192 7,2 etc.), gives us more maneuvering room (3 options next turn), and positions us to approach apples like (6,6) and (5,2) while maintaining aggression.

Top edge means we control the ceiling.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,7)**:\n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n   - Pros: Moves toward apples (6,6, etc.), keeps center control.\n   - Cons: Might bring us closer to enemy if he moves UP aggressively, but he's at (6,1) - he'd need 5+ turns to reach us. We can outgrow him.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,8)**:\n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty)\n   - Pros: Moves toward apples (5,2), (4,0), opens up left side. 4 directions next turn.\n   - Cons: Moves away from center slightly.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7,8)**:\n   - \u2705 SAFE (empty, we just came from (7,8) last turn)\n   - Pros: Returns to previous position, maintains center-right control.\n   - Cons: Doesn't advance new territory, gives us fewer options next turn (UP would corner us at (7,9)).\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n- We have MORE apples? NO! Enemy has 1, we have 0. So NO forced head-on collision yet. We NEED to grow!\n- Aggression is key, but we need apples FIRST. The apple at (6,6) is just 2 steps DOWN from us. Getting that would be huge - we'd be 1-1, and then we can play aggressive.\n- Long-term: We want to control the upper half while the enemy is stuck at bottom. If we can secure 2-3 apples up here, we'll have the score lead to force dangerous plays.\n\n**ELIMINATING RISKY MOVES:**\n- None are risky immediately, but we want MAXIMUM FUTURE OPTIONS + APPLE APPROACH.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** DOWN to (6,7). This sets us up perfectly for (6,6) apple next turn (if still there), gives us 4 safe directions next turn, and keeps us central to dominate the board. Plus, moving DOWN toward the enemy's \"zone\" could psychologically pressure him - he might think we're coming for him!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE:** Control the top half, secure 2 apples in the next 3 turns, then use our score advantage to cut off his escape routes. We'll box him into the bottom-left corner!\n\n**DECISION:** DOWN",

He's moving UP to chase apples at (6,4), (5,2), or (3,1). He's hungry and potentially aggressive. But he's below us. We own the high ground!\n\n**OUR POSITION:** (6,7) - CENTER-UPPER BOARD. We're in a power position. The apple at (6,6) is literally one step below us. This is FREE REAL ESTATE. Taking it gives us our first apple and ties the score 1-1. From there, we can dictate the flow.\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\n- **UP (6,8)**: Empty. Safe, but we lose the apple at (6,6). Why waste the golden opportunity? We want that apple now.\n- **DOWN (6,6)**: **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e THIS IS THE PLAY! Getting this apple grows us to length 2 (tail now at (6,7) after we move) and puts us at 1-1. Perfect.\n- **LEFT (5,7)**: Empty. Safe, but moves sideways away from the free apple. Bad play.\n- **RIGHT (7,7)**: Empty. Safe, but also misses the apple. No thanks.\n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINATION PLAN:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE:** Eat the apple at (6,6). Get on the board. Tie the score.\n2. **NEXT MOVE:** After growing, we'll be at (6,6) with body at (6,7). From there, we can chase (6,4) or (5,2) or move aggressively left. We'll have options.\n3. **LONG-TERM:** Once tied, we use our higher ceiling (we're in the upper half) to box him into the bottom. He's stuck in the 0-2 y-range. We'll take the top apples (3,9), (4,7), (8,5) and force him into a corner. Then we chase.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Moving DOWN to (6,6) is 100% safe. No enemy bodies there. The enemy is at (6,2) - he's not reaching (6,6) this turn. If he moves UP twice in a row, he might reach (6,4) by turn 5, but we'll be grown and ready to cut him off.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** This is a no-brainer. We take the free apple. We get the point. We start our climb. We turn the pressure on.\n\n**GOING DOWN FOR THE WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e**\n\nDOWN",

He's got 2 apples and is likely moving UP to chase (6,4) or (5,2) itself (but that's his current head? Wait no, head is (5,2) so he might go LEFT to (4,2) or UP to (5,3) to chase (6,4) or (4,0)? Actually from (5,2) he can go UP to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,2) or RIGHT to (6,2) but that's his own body so he can't. DOWN to (5,1) is safe but away from apples. Most likely UP or LEFT.\n\n**OUR POSITION:** We just moved DOWN to (6,6) and ate the apple! We're now at (6,6) with body [(6,7)] and we have 1 apple! Score is now 2-2? Wait no: we had 1 apple, ate another, so we have 2 apples. Snake #0 has 2 apples. So 2-2! We tied it up! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (from our new head at (6,6)):**\n- **UP (6,7)**: Our own body! That's a crash. Can't go UP.\n- **DOWN (6,5)**: Empty. Safe. Moves us down toward (6,4) apple.\n- **LEFT (5,6)**: Empty. Safe. Moves us toward the apple cluster at (4,7), (3,9) etc.\n- **RIGHT (7,6)**: Empty. Safe. Moves us toward (7,4) apple and right side.\n\n**STRATEGIC DOMINATION PLAN:**\n1. **IMMEDIATE:** We need to keep momentum. We can't go UP (suicide). So choose between DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n2. **ENEMY PREDICTION:** Snake #0 is below us and hungry. He might go for (6,4) apple. If we go DOWN to (6,5), we get closer to (6,4) and potentially block him. But we also might run into him if he goes UP to (6,3) or (6,4).\n3. **SAFETY FIRST:** We must avoid head-on collisions. If we go DOWN to (6,5) and he goes UP to (6,3), we're safe. If he goes UP to (6,4) and we go DOWN to (6,5), we're not colliding (he's at (6,4), we're at (6,5)). But next turn we could potentially crash if we both go toward same spot.\n4. **OPTIONS GROWTH:** LEFT (5,6) gives us access to (4,7) apple and (3,9) apple. RIGHT (7,6) gives us (7,4) and (9,2). DOWN (6,5) gets us closer to (6,4) and (5,2) but that's where enemy is.\n5. **AGGRESSION:** Since we're tied, we can play aggressive. But we need to be smart. The enemy is in the bottom-left area. We should claim the top-right or center. LEFT moves us toward center-left, RIGHT moves us toward right side, DOWN moves us toward enemy territory.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n- DOWN: Potential confrontation with enemy moving UP. But we can see him coming. If he goes UP, we might have a chance to head him off later.\n- LEFT: Safe, opens up top-left area. Less direct confrontation.\n- RIGHT: Safe, opens up right side. Might avoid enemy entirely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Since we're tied 2-2, we need to get ahead. The apple at (6,4) is juicy but risky. The apple at (5,2) is on top of enemy's potential path. Let's claim the right side where there are fewer apples but more space to maneuver. We'll go RIGHT to (7,6) to start taking control of the right flank. From there we can chase (7,4), (9,2), (8,0) or even loop back to center.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We go RIGHT to (7,6). It's safe, gives us options, and avoids immediate collision with enemy who is likely moving UP or LEFT. We'll build our territory on the right.\n\n**HEADING RIGHT TO CLAIM THE FLANK! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc0d**\n\nRIGHT",

Good.\n- **Available Moves from (7,6):**\n  - **UP (7,7):** Empty. Safe. Opens path toward top-right apples (8,5), (9,2).\n  - **DOWN (7,5):** Empty. Safe. Moves toward (7,4) apple.\n  - **LEFT (7,5):** Empty. Safe. Would bring us back to (6,6) (our tail), but that\u2019s moving backwards into own body? Wait: our tail is (6,6) and we are at (7,6). Moving LEFT to (6,6) would be moving into our own tail (since tail moves away when we move, but at the start of the turn, (6,6) is our body). According to rules: \u201cMoving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\u201d So LEFT is actually lethal because we\u2019d be moving into our own body. Can\u2019t go LEFT.\n  - **RIGHT (8,6):** Empty. Safe. Further right flank, away from enemy.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** They\u2019re in bottom-left, we\u2019re top-right. No immediate collision risk. They might go UP chasing (6,4) or (4,0). We need to avoid head-on collision if we both go toward center.\n- **Strategic Goal:** We\u2019re tied. Need to grow. The apple at (7,4) is 2 steps away (DOWN then DOWN). The apple at (9,2) is also reachable. We should secure the right side and avoid enemy.\n- **Risk:** Moving UP gives us access to (8,5) apple next turn. Moving RIGHT keeps us safe and distant. Moving DOWN gets us closer to (7,4) but also brings us down toward enemy territory (they\u2019re at y=2). We want to stay high (y=6-9) to dominate top-right.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Claim the top-right quadrant. Use UP and RIGHT moves to snake around the perimeter, eating apples there while keeping enemy at bay. If enemy moves up, we might cut them off later. For now, avoid center.\n\n**DECISION:** UP is best. It opens the top-right area, avoids our own body, and sets up for (8,5) apple. RIGHT is safe but less aggressive. DOWN is risky (going toward enemy). LEFT is suicide.\n\n**HEADING UP TO CLAIM THE HIGH GROUND! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d**\n\nUP",

They\u2019re low on the board (y=1-2). Their possible moves: UP to (4,2) which is their own body (dead), LEFT to (3,1) (empty), RIGHT to (5,1) (empty), DOWN to (4,0) (has an apple!). They likely won\u2019t kill themselves, so LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. DOWN gives them an apple at (4,0), which is attractive. They\u2019re not a direct threat yet.\n- **Our Position:** Head at (7,7), body [(7,6)]. Score 1. We moved UP last turn, now at (7,7). We\u2019re in the top-right corner. Safe.\n- **Available Moves from (7,7):**\n  - **UP (7,8):** Empty. Safe. Moves us to the top edge (y=8).\n  - **DOWN (7,6):** This is our own body (the cell we came from). Moving directly backwards into your own body? That\u2019s a death sentence. Can\u2019t go DOWN.\n  - **LEFT (6,7):** Empty. Safe. Moves us toward center-left.\n  - **RIGHT (8,7):** Empty. Safe. Moves us to the right edge.\n- **Strategic Consideration:** We\u2019re in the top-right. The apple at (8,5) is two steps away: DOWN then RIGHT (or RIGHT then DOWN). But we need to plan our path without getting trapped. We also have apples at (9,2) and (7,4). We should secure the perimeter. Since we\u2019re at (7,7), moving UP to (7,8) brings us to the top edge, which is a strong defensive position. From there, we can go RIGHT to (8,8) or LEFT to (6,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,7) also hugs the right edge. Which one gives more future options?\n  - From (7,8) (if UP): Possible moves: LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8), DOWN (7,7) - but DOWN would be moving into our own body (since we came from there). So from (7,8), only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That\u2019s two options.\n  - From (8,7) (if RIGHT): Possible moves: UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7) - but LEFT is moving into our own body (since we came from (7,7)). So from (8,7), only UP and DOWN are safe. That\u2019s two options.\n  - Both give two options, but moving UP to (7,8) puts us on the top edge, which is harder for the enemy to approach. Also, from (7,8) we can go to (8,8) and then down to (8,7), etc. We want to dominate the top-right corner and avoid the center where the enemy might go.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** They might go DOWN to (4,0) for the apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to stay safe. They\u2019re far away, so no collision risk this turn.\n- **Risk Assessment:** All moves are safe. No immediate death. We need to think about future turns: we want to avoid being boxed in. Moving UP to the top edge is a good perimeter move. It keeps us away from the enemy and gives us a clear path along the top. The apple at (8,5) is still reachable, but we might need to go DOWN later. For now, securing the top edge is smart.\n- **Long-Term Plan:** Claim the top-right quadrant (x=7-9, y=6-9). Use perimeter moves to snake around, eating apples in that area. Avoid the center where the enemy is. If the enemy comes up, we can trap them against the wall. If we can force a head-on collision later when we have more apples, we win.\n\n**DECISION:** UP to (7,8). It\u2019s safe, gives us a strong positional advantage on the top edge, and keeps options open. RIGHT is also safe but puts us on the right edge, which might be similar. However, UP feels more dominant and sets us up to go RIGHT next turn if needed.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**TURN 7 LIVE - ENEMY HAS 4 APPLES, WE NEED TO CLOSE THE GAP! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d**\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n- **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 at (3,1) with body [(4,1),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2)] and 4 apples. They're still low on the board (y=1-2). Their possible moves: UP to (3,2) (empty), LEFT to (2,1) (empty), RIGHT to (4,1) (their own body - DEAD), DOWN to (3,0) (empty). They likely won't crash into themselves, so UP, LEFT, or DOWN are safe. They might go for an apple - (3,0) is empty but near (4,0) apple, (3,2) is empty. No immediate threat to us.\n- **Our Position:** Head at (7,8), body [(7,7),(7,6)]. Score 1. We're on the top edge (y=8). Safe.\n- **Available Moves from (7,8):**\n  - **UP (7,9):** Empty. Safe. Moves us to the top-right corner corner (max y).\n  - **DOWN (7,7):** This is our own body (the cell we came from). Moving directly backwards into your own body? That's a death sentence. Can't go DOWN.\n  - **LEFT (6,8):** Empty. Safe. Moves us toward center-top.\n  - **RIGHT (8,8):** Empty. Safe. Moves us to the right edge (x=8).\n- **Strategic Consideration:** We're on the top edge at (7,8). Moving UP to (7,9) puts us in the absolute top-right corner. From there, we can only go LEFT (6,9) or DOWN (7,8) - but DOWN would be moving back into our previous position (7,8), which is now empty after we leave it, so that's actually safe! Wait no - if we move UP to (7,9), then next turn we could go DOWN to (7,8) which would be empty (since we just left it). That's not moving backwards into our own body because our body would be at (7,8) and (7,7) at that point. Actually, let me think: if we move UP to (7,9), our body becomes [(7,8),(7,7)]. Then if we move DOWN to (7,8) next turn, that's moving into our own body (which is now at (7,8)). That's bad! So from (7,9), we'd have only LEFT (6,9) as a safe option (since DOWN is into our body and RIGHT is off board).\n  - From (6,8) (if LEFT): Possible moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8) - but RIGHT would be moving into our own body at (7,8). So three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n  - From (8,8) (if RIGHT): Possible moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8) - but LEFT is moving into our own body. So two safe options: UP, DOWN.\n- **Risk Assessment:** All moves are safe this turn. But we need to think ahead! Moving UP to (7,9) is the MOST dangerous because it leaves us with only ONE safe move next turn (LEFT to (6,9)). That's getting boxed in! Moving LEFT to (6,8) gives us THREE safe options next turn - much more flexibility. Moving RIGHT to (8,8) gives us two options.\n- **Apple Strategy:** We need apples to catch up! Looking at the board, we have apples at (8,5), (9,2), (8,3), (8,0), (6,5), (6,3), (7,6). From (6,8), we can reach many of these: (6,5) is DOWN 3 steps, (6,3) is DOWN 5 steps, (7,6) is DOWN then RIGHT. From (8,8), we can go for (8,5) DOWN 3 steps, (9,2) DOWN then DOWN then RIGHT, etc.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** They might go UP to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,1), staying low. They're far from us, so no collision risk.\n- **Long-Term Plan:** We need to dominate the top edge and right side. From (6,8), we can snake down through the right side, eating apples at (6,5), (6,3), (8,3), (8,0), (9,2) while keeping the enemy confined to the left side. We should avoid the center where there are many apples but also where the enemy might migrate. Claim the perimeter!\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (6,8). It gives us maximum flexibility (3 safe moves next turn), keeps us away from the dangerous corner, and positions us to sweep down the right side for apples. UP is too cornered, RIGHT is okay but less flexible. LEFT is the smart aggressive move.\n\nLEFT",

We need to close the gap, but survival comes first.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (6,8). Body at (7,8).\n2.  **Possible Moves & Immediate Threats:**\n    *   **UP (6,9):** Moves to top edge. Check safety: (6,9) is empty. Not off board. Not into own body (body is at 7,8). *Safe.*\n    *   **DOWN (6,7):** Moves toward center. Check safety: (6,7) is empty. *Safe.*\n    *   **LEFT (5,8):** Moves left. Check safety: (5,8) is empty. *Safe.*\n    *   **RIGHT (7,8):** Moves right. Check safety: (7,8) is occupied by our own body. **DEAD.** (Moving directly into your own body segment).\n    *   **Self-Collision Check (Backwards):** Moving DOWN would be moving *away* from the body at (7,8), so it's not a direct backwards move into the body. Moving UP/LEFT/RIGHT are perpendicular or away.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #0 Analysis:**\n    *   Head at (2,1). Body at (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n    *   Possible moves: UP to (2,2) [Empty], LEFT to (1,1) [Empty], DOWN to (2,0) [Empty]. RIGHT to (3,1) [Body]. They are safe and unlikely to head-on collision with us immediately given the distance.\n4.  **Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (6,9):** Takes us to the top corner. From (6,9), next turn we can go LEFT (5,9), DOWN (6,8) [Safe - empty after we leave], or RIGHT (7,9). This is actually okay, not as boxed in as I initially thought last turn. However, it puts us on the very edge.\n    *   **DOWN (6,7):** Moves us into the main grid. From (6,7), we can go UP (6,8) [Body], DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). We have 3 safe options next turn. This moves us toward apples at (6,5), (6,3), (7,6).\n    *   **LEFT (5,8):** Moves us toward the left side of the board. From (5,8), we can go UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8) [Body]. 3 safe options.\n5.  **Apple Proximity & Plan:**\n    *   Apples at (6,5) and (6,3) are directly South. Apples at (7,6) are Southeast.\n    *   Moving **DOWN (6,7)** puts us on the same column as the valuable vertical line of apples (6,5) and (6,3). It also keeps us centered relative to the map, avoiding the edges where movement can become restricted.\n    *   Moving UP puts us on the edge. Moving LEFT moves us away from the densest cluster of apples on the right side (8,5), (9,2), etc.\n    *   **Aggression:** The enemy is at (2,1). They are confined to the bottom left quadrant effectively. By moving DOWN, we maintain dominance over the center and right side. We need to start harvesting.\n6.  **Final Selection:** **DOWN** is the most flexible move that positions us to aggressively hunt the apples at (6,5) and (6,3) next. It avoids the trap of the top edge and keeps us centrally located for future maneuvering against the enemy.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (6,7) to line up for the vertical apples at (6,5) and (6,3). Maintain central control. Watch enemy movement\u2014don't let them box us in from below.\n\nDOWN",

No more playing scared\u2014we're hunting! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (Turn 9):**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (6,7). Body at (6,8).\n    *   **Board Context:** We are in the *center-right* of the map. The enemy snake (#0) is still way down in the bottom-left quadrant (heads at 1,1). They are NOT an immediate threat to us right now\u2014they're too far away to collide with us this turn. Our biggest threat is getting boxed in by our own moves or the walls.\n\n2.  **Analyzing My Moves (Safety First):**\n    *   **UP (6,8):** Moves into my *own body* (which is at 6,8). **DEAD.** \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (6,6):** (6,6) is currently **EMPTY**. No snake bodies there. *Safe.* \u2705\n    *   **LEFT (5,7):** (5,7) is currently **EMPTY**. *Safe.* \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT (7,7):** (7,7) is currently **EMPTY**. *Safe.* \u2705\n\n    *Elimination:* UP kills me instantly. I have 3 safe options: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation (Aggression & Growth):**\n    *   *Current Score:* 1 vs 4. I am losing. I NEED apples.\n    *   *Apple Proximity:*\n        *   **DOWN (6,6):** Moves me *away* from the nearest apple at (6,5) and (7,6), but keeps me centered. (6,5) is 1 tile down from the target. (7,6) is 1 up and 1 right. If I go DOWN to (6,6), I'm sandwiched between my own body (6,8) and the wall? No, (6,6) opens up (6,5) and (7,6) next turn. It's a \"reset\" position.\n        *   **LEFT (5,7):** Moves me West. (5,7) is safe. From there, I can go to (5,6) or (4,7). This moves me *away* from the apples to the East (8,5), (9,2). Not ideal for hunting.\n        *   **RIGHT (7,7):** This is the play. I am currently at (6,7). (7,7) is East. (7,6) is the apple directly Southeast of me. If I move RIGHT to (7,7), I am **CLOSER** to the apples at (7,6) and (8,5). This is the direction of growth. This is the direction of the enemy's potential future expansion? No, enemy is West. This is *my* territory.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment (Future Freedom):**\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (7,7)**:\n        *   Next turn options: UP (7,8) [Empty], DOWN (7,6) [Apple or Empty], LEFT (6,7) [Empty after I leave], RIGHT (8,7) [Empty].\n        *   That is **4 open directions**. Maximum flexibility.\n    *   If I go **DOWN (6,6)**:\n        *   Next turn options: UP (6,7) [Empty], LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) [Apple], DOWN (6,5).\n        *   Also 4 open directions. Good, but I'm moving away from the *right-side* apples.\n    *   If I go **LEFT (5,7)**:\n        *   Next turn options: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7).\n        *   4 open directions. But I'm drifting West, away from the loot.\n\n    *   **Verdict:** The game is about **Dominance**. The right side has a cluster of apples: (7,6), (8,5), (9,2). The left side has (4,7), (4,6), (3,9). Since I am currently positioned at (6,7), the right side is the path of least resistance and highest reward density relative to my current position.\n\n5.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy is at (1,1). They are likely to eat the apples at (1,4), (3,1), or (4,0). They are moving slowly because they are stuck in a \"trunk\" formation (2,1)-(4,2). They are not a threat to me this turn. I need to worry about the board state, not the snake that is 6+ tiles away.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI am choosing **RIGHT**.\nWhy? Because it puts me on the coordinate (7,7). From there, I can chase the apple at (7,6) or pivot to (8,5). It keeps my tail at (6,8), giving me a clear path back. It avoids the wall (I have plenty of room) and avoids my own body. It is the most aggressive move that sets up an apple eat next turn (7,6 is right there).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 9: Move RIGHT to (7,7). Set up to eat (7,6) on Turn 10. Maintain central/right control to prevent the enemy from ever getting a foothold in the upper half. If I get big enough, I will trap them in the bottom-left corner.\n\n**CHAT, IS THIS THE PLAY?

Body at (6,7). Tail at (6,8) (which will move forward as we leave, clearing space).\n    *   **Board Context:** We are in the upper-right quadrant. Enemy is bottom-left. Distance is huge (about 6-7 tiles away), so no immediate collision threat *this turn*. My main goal is securing that apple at (7,6).\n\n2.  **Analyzing My Moves (Safety First):**\n    *   **UP (7,8):** Currently **EMPTY**. Safe. \u2705\n    *   **DOWN (7,6):** **HOLY MOLY!** That's an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e Safe *and* gets a point. Safe. \u2705\n    *   **LEFT (6,7):** My *old body* location.

This is a high-mobility position.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation (Aggression & Growth):**\n    *   *Current Score:* 1 vs 4. We are losing. We NEED that apple to close the gap to 2.\n    *   *Apple Proximity:*\n        *   **DOWN (7,6):** It's literally right there! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it grows my body by 1 segment and puts me at 2 apples. The apple at (8,5) is also adjacent to (7,6). This is the definition of \"dominating the board\" by securing territory.\n        *   **UP (7,8):** Moves away from the apple cluster. Bad for growth.\n        *   **LEFT (6,7):** Moves back to where I came from. Doesn't get me closer to any immediate apple (closest is (6,5), but (7,6) is closer).\n        *   **RIGHT (8,7):** Moves parallel to the apple, not onto it. (8,5) is two steps away. Why take two steps when you can take one and eat?\n\n    *   **Verdict:** **DOWN** is the only move that makes sense. It scores a point, grows the snake, and sets me up perfectly near (8,5) and (9,2) for the next turn. I am currently \"trapping\" the right side of the map for myself.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment (Future Freedom):**\n    *   If I go **DOWN (7,6)** and eat the apple:\n        *   My body will extend. Current head (7,7) becomes neck, old neck (6,7) becomes body, and the tail (6,8) moves forward.\n        *   Next turn options from (7,6): UP (7,7) [My body], DOWN (7,5) [Empty], LEFT (6,6) [Empty], RIGHT (8,6) [Empty].\n        *   I will have **3 safe moves** next turn (UP is blocked by my own body). That is perfectly fine. You don't need 4 moves; you just need *one* good path forward.\n        *   Moving DOWN puts my tail at (6,7), which is decently far from my head, giving me time to maneuver.\n\n5.  **Enemy Prediction:**\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (1,2). They have apples at (1,4) and (3,1) nearby. They are likely moving UP or RIGHT.\n    *   They are 6+ tiles away vertically and horizontally. They cannot reach me this turn. I am safe to eat in peace. Let them eat their little bottom-left apples; I'm claiming the right side.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\n**DOWN** to (7,6). \ud83c\udf4e\nWe secure the point. We grow. We extend our reach into the right-side cluster. This is how we claw back the lead.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 10: Eat the apple at (7,6). Turn 11: Likely move to (8,5) or (9,2) to keep the momentum going. Keep expanding rightward to cut off the map.

We're still hunting, but the board is heating up. The enemy is at (1,3), still chilling in the bottom-left. I need to keep expanding rightward to secure the apple cluster.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS (Turn 11):**\n\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (7, 6). Body at [(7, 7), (6, 7)]. Tail is moving from (6, 8).\n2.  **Apple Hunt:** The apple at (8, 5) is *right there* diagonally. The apple at (9, 2) is a bit far but reachable. I need to get that point.\n3.  **Safety Check (Eliminate Immediate Death):**\n    *   **UP (7, 7):** **DEAD!** That's my current body segment. I'm currently at (7, 6), so (7, 7) is occupied by my neck. Hitting myself = death. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (7, 5):** **EMPTY.** Safe. \u2705\n    *   **LEFT (6, 6):** **EMPTY.** Safe. \u2705\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 6):** **EMPTY.** Safe. \u2705\n\n4.  **Strategic Evaluation (Growth & Positioning):**\n    *   **DOWN (7, 5):** This lands me on an empty tile. It moves me closer to the apple at (9, 2) and (7, 4), but *away* from the immediate apple at (8, 5).\n    *   **LEFT (6, 6):** This is a retreat. It moves me back towards the center. While safe, it puts distance between me and the right-side apples. I want to dominate the right side.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 6):** **BINGO!** This moves me right. From (8, 6), I am adjacent to (8, 5) (apple) and (9, 2) (apple). Next turn, I can likely go DOWN to (8, 5) to eat.\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Enemy is at (1, 3). They have an apple at (1, 4) directly above them. They will almost certainly go UP. They are too far away to threaten me. I have free rein on the right side.\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment (Future Freedom):**\n    *   If I go **RIGHT (8, 6)**:\n        *   Next turn options: UP (8, 7) [Empty], DOWN (8, 5) [Apple!], LEFT (7, 6) [My tail? Wait, my tail moves from (6,8) to (6,7). My body is [(7,6), (7,7)]. So (7,6) will be my body. LEFT is blocked by my own body.].\n        *   Wait, if I move RIGHT to (8,6), my body becomes [(7,6), (7,7)].\n        *   Next turn, LEFT is (7,6) which will be my body. So LEFT is blocked.\n        *   UP is (8,7) - Empty.\n        *   DOWN is (8,5) - Apple.\n        *   RIGHT is (9,6) - Empty.\n        *   I have 3 safe moves next turn. That's perfect.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 5):** If I go DOWN, next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 5). But why take two turns when I can take one? I want the apple *now*.\n    *   **Verdict:** **RIGHT** is the aggressive move. It secures territory and sets up the apple eat immediately next turn.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\n**RIGHT** to (8, 6). Positioning for the apple at (8, 5).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 11: Position at (8, 6). Turn 12: Eat apple at (8, 5). Turn 13: Move toward (9, 2). Keep expanding right. Box the enemy in the left side.\n\n**CHAT, WE MAKING MOVES! LET'S GO!** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7)].\n    *   *Wait a second*, looking at the board state from Turn 11, I am at (8, 6).\n    *   The board shows: `6 . . . . A . . T 1 .` (Head at 8,6).\n    *   The board also shows: `7 . . . . A . . T . .` (Tail at 7,8? No, wait).\n    *   Let's look at the provided board state again.\n    *   Row 6: ` . . . . A . . T 1 .` (x=7 is T, x=8 is 1).\n    *   Row 7: ` . . . . A . . T . .` (x=7 is T? No, x=7 is empty, x=8 is T? Let's check coordinates).\n    *   Actually, the board visual is tricky. Let's rely on the text data.\n    *   My Head: (8, 6).\n    *   My Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7)].\n    *   My Tail: (7, 7)? No, the list is Head->Tail. [(7,6), (7,7)].\n    *   Wait, the board shows `(7, 7)` is `T` in Row 7? Let's check the map.\n    *   Row 7 (y=7): `. . . . A . . T . .` (x=0 to 9). The `T` is at x=7? No, the `T` is at x=6? Let's count.\n    *   `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n    *   `. . . . A . . T . .`\n    *   x=0: .\n    *   x=1: .\n    *   x=2: .\n    *   x=3: .\n    *   x=4: A\n    *   x=5: .\n    *   x=6: .\n    *   x=7: T\n    *   x=8: .\n    *   x=9: .\n    *   So (7, 7) is indeed a Tail. But the text says Body is [(7, 6), (7, 7)].\n    *   And Head is (8, 6).\n    *   So my body occupies (7, 6) and (7, 7). Correct.\n\n2.  **Eliminate Immediate Death:**\n    *   **UP (8, 7):** Is it occupied? My body is at (7, 6) and (7, 7). (8, 7) is empty on the board (Row 7, Col 8 is empty). **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN (8, 5):** Is it occupied? (8, 5) is an Apple (Row 5, Col 8 is A). **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (7, 6):** Is it occupied? My body is at (7, 6). **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 6):** Is it occupied? (9, 6) is empty (Row 6, Col 9 is empty). **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   We want to eat the apple at (8, 5).\n    *   **DOWN** moves us to (8, 5). We eat. We grow.\n        *   *Consequence:* Our tail moves from (7, 7) to (7, 6) (assuming no apple, but we ARE eating, so the tail doesn't move! Wait, mechanics check: If we eat, we grow by 1. The tail stays. The body shifts.)\n        *   If we eat at (8, 5), our new body becomes [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)].\n    *   **UP (8, 7):** Moves away from the apple at (8, 5). Not ideal. We want points.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 6):** Moves away from the apple at (8, 5). Not ideal.\n\n4.  **Enemy Prediction (Snake #0):**\n    *   Head: (1, 4). Body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)].\n    *   There is an apple at (4, 0).\n    *   There is an apple at (1, 4) \u2014 wait, looking at the board row 4: `4 . 0 . . . . A A . .`\n    *   x=1 is '0' (Enemy Head).\n    *   x=6 is 'A'.\n    *   x=7 is 'A'.\n    *   The enemy is at (1, 4). He has space. He likely won't move into me. Distance is huge (8 blocks away).\n\n5.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   If I go **DOWN** to (8, 5) and eat:\n        *   My new body: Head (8, 5). Neck (8, 6). Body (7, 6). Tail (7, 7).\n        *   Next turn, I will be at (8, 5).\n        *   Options next turn:\n            *   UP (8, 6) -> Neck. Blocked.\n            *   DOWN (8, 4) -> Empty? Row 4, Col 8 is '.' (Look at board: `4 . 0 . . . . A A . .` -> Col 8 is '.'). Safe.\n            *   LEFT (7, 5) -> Empty? Row 5, Col 7 is 'A'. (Apple). Safe/Eat.\n            *   RIGHT (9, 5) -> Empty? Row 5, Col 9 is '.'. Safe.\n        *   I have 3 safe moves next turn. Perfect.\n\n    *   Why not **RIGHT** or **UP**?\n        *   **RIGHT** to (9, 6): Leaves the apple at (8, 5). Someone else (if bots were here) could take it. I need points to win.\n        *   **UP** to (8, 7): Leaves the apple. Not maximizing score.\n\n6.  **Verdict:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the winning move. It secures the apple, increases my score (2 -> 3), and keeps my future options open (Down/Left/Right). I will still be significantly smaller than Snake #0 (3 vs 5), so I need to keep eating.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nEat the apple at (8, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 12: Eat apple (8, 5). Turn 13: Move to (8, 4) or (7, 5) depending on next apple drops. Continue hunting right-side apples. We need to close the score gap (3 vs 5) to survive the late game.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

It's not a loop yet.\n\n    *   Let's compare the options for survival and points.\n    *   **Option A (LEFT/Apple):** Score 4. Head (7, 5). Next options: DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5).\n    *   **Option B (DOWN/No Apple):** Score 3. Head (8, 4). Next options: DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4), RIGHT (9, 4).\n    *   **Option C (RIGHT/No Apple):** Score 3. Head (9, 5). Next options: UP (9, 6), DOWN (9, 4).\n\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   I need to catch up to Snake #0 (Score 5). I need apples.\n        *   The apple at (7, 5) is *right there*. It's risky to leave it.\n        *   Is (7, 5) a trap?\n            *   My body occupies (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6).\n            *   (7, 5) is adjacent to (7, 6) [Body], (8, 5) [Body], (6, 5) [Apple], (7, 4) [Apple].\n            *   If I take (7, 5), I am surrounded by my own body on the Right and Up.\n            *   But I have Left and Down.\n            *   However, (6, 5) and (7, 4) are both apples.\n            *   If I go to (7, 5) and eat:\n                *   Next turn, if I go LEFT to (6, 5) (Apple):\n                    *   Head (6, 5). Body (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6). Tail (7, 7).\n                    *   From (6, 5): UP (6, 6), DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5). All look empty? (6, 4) is Apple. (5, 5) is empty? Row 5, x=5 is '.' Yes.\n                    *   This opens up the board.\n            *   If I go DOWN to (8, 4):\n                *   I don't eat. I move away from the apple at (7, 5).\n                *   I head towards (8, 3), (7, 4).\n                *   (8, 4) leads to (7, 4) or (8, 3).\n                *   (8, 3) is an Apple. (7, 4) is an Apple.\n                *   (8, 4) seems safer because I have 3 exits.\n                *   (7, 5) has 2 exits.\n                *   BUT (7, 5) gives me a point.\n\n    *   **The Trap Factor:**\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7, 5), I am connecting my head to my body at (7, 6).\n        *   My body is a line: (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7).\n        *   My new head is at (7, 5).\n        *   My new body is (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7).\n        *   This creates a shape:\n            ```\n            (7,7) T\n            (7,6) B\n            (8,6) B\n            (8,5) B\n            (7,5) H (Hypothetical)\n            ```\n            It's a sort of 'Z' shape.\n            From (7, 5), I can go Left (6, 5) or Down (7, 4).\n            From (6, 5), I can go to (5, 5) or (6, 4) or (6, 6).\n            From (7, 4), I can go to (7, 3) or (6, 4) or (8, 4).\n            It's a bit tight.\n\n    *   **Comparison with DOWN (8, 4):**\n        *   Head (8, 4). Body (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6). Tail (7, 6) (wait, no, if I don't eat, tail moves).\n        *   If I don't eat, tail moves from (7, 7) to (7, 6).\n        *   New Body: (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6).\n        *   This is a straight line on the right side mostly.\n        *   From (8, 4): Left (7, 4), Down (8, 3), Right (9, 4).\n        *   (7, 4) is an apple. (8, 3) is an apple.\n        *   (9, 4) is empty.\n        *   This gives me 3 directions.\n        *   However, I leave the apple at (7, 5).\n        *   Why is (7, 5) important?\n        *   It's an apple. I need points. Score is 3 vs 5.\n        *   I must eat.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating the \"No Apple\" options:**\n        *   If I go DOWN (8, 4), I am at (8, 4).\n        *   If I go RIGHT (9, 5), I am at (9, 5).\n        *   (9, 5) is the edge. Limiting. (9, 5) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 7)... I can run the wall, but it's easy to get trapped. Avoid edges if possible.\n        *   (8, 4) is better than (9, 5).\n        *   Is (8, 4) better than (7, 5) *with an apple*?\n        *   If I eat at (7, 5), I grow. The tail stays. My body becomes longer.\n        *   If I go to (8, 4), I don't grow. The tail moves.\n        *   Being longer is generally better for head-on collisions (if I get bigger).\n        *   BUT, being longer makes you more vulnerable to self-collision if you're tight.\n        *   However, I need points to win.\n        *   Let's look at the apple density.\n        *   Left side has (4, 6), (6, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3).\n        *   The apples are clustering slightly left/center of the right side.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (8, 4), I am closer to (8, 3) and (7, 4).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7, 5), I am on top of (7, 5) and adjacent to (6, 5) and (7, 4).\n\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n        *   Snake #0 is at (1, 5). He sees apples at (3, 9), (4, 6), (3, 8).\n        *   He is likely to move UP or RIGHT.\n        *   He is far away. No collision risk this turn.\n\n    *   **The Winning Move:**\n        *   I have to pick between the apple (LEFT) or the safe path (DOWN).\n        *   Score is 3 vs 5. I am losing.\n        *   Taking the apple brings me to 4. Gap closes.\n        *   Leaving the apple leaves me at 3. Gap widens (or stays wide if he eats).\n        *   I must take the apple.\n        *   Is (7, 5) a suicide trap?\n        *   No, I have 2 exits.\n        *   Is (8, 4) better for survival?\n        *   Yes, 3 exits.\n        *   But can I win without points? No.\n        *   I'll risk the slightly tighter position for the point. It keeps me in the game.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the board state again.**\n        *   Row 5: `5 . 0 . . . . A . 1 .`\n        *   Enemy at (1, 5). I am at (8, 5).\n        *   If I go LEFT, I go to (7, 5).\n        *   If I go DOWN, I go to (8, 4).\n        *   If I go DOWN, I lose the apple at (7, 5).\n        *   If I go LEFT, I eat.\n        *   Let's check the move LEFT again.\n        *   Head (7, 5).\n        *   Body (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6).\n        *   Tail (7, 7) (stays).\n        *   Next turn from (7, 5):\n        *   I can go DOWN (7, 4) -> Apple.\n        *   I can go LEFT (6, 5) -> Apple.\n        *   I cannot go UP (7, 6) -> Body.\n        *   I cannot go RIGHT (8, 5) -> Body.\n        *   This is a \"corridor\". I am entering a space between my own body and the open space.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (7, 4):\n        *   Head (7, 4). Body (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). Tail (7, 6).\n        *   From (7, 4):\n        *   UP (7, 5) -> Body.\n        *   DOWN (7, 3) -> Empty? Row 3: `3 . T . . . . A . A A` -> x=7 is 'A'. Safe.\n        *   LEFT (6, 4) -> Apple.\n        *   RIGHT (8, 4) -> Empty? Row 4: `4 . 0 . . . . A A . .` -> x=8 is '.'. Safe.\n        *   From (7, 4), I have 3 options. This is good.\n        *   So, (7, 5) is actually a gateway to a more open space, provided I don't hesitate.\n        *   It forces me to move Left or Down.\n        *   Both (6, 5) and (7, 4) are apples.\n        *   Moving to (7, 5) puts me on a \"rail\".\n        *   This is actually a good play. I secure the point and channel my movement into a productive direction (clearing the bottom-left area of my quadrant).\n\n    *   **Why not DOWN (8, 4)?**\n        *   (8, 4) is safe, but I'm moving parallel to the wall.\n        *   (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2)...\n        *   This is boring and risky long term if I get stuck against the wall.\n        *   The apple at (7, 5) is a pivot point. It connects the upper area (my body) to the lower area (apples).\n        *   By taking (7, 5), I claim the pivot.\n\n    *   **Final check:**\n        *   Score 3 vs 5. I need the apple.\n        *   Safety: (7, 5) allows 2 moves next turn. (8, 4) allows 3.\n        *   However, the 2 moves from (7, 5) are BOTH apples. High value targets.\n        *   The 3 moves from (8, 4) include (8, 3) (Apple), (7, 4) (Apple), and (9, 4) (Empty).\n        *   (7, 5) is slightly more restrictive but leads to better board control (center/right).\n        *   Actually, let's look at the map.\n        *   My body is on the right.\n        *   The apples are spread out.\n        *   (7, 5) is currently empty in the prompt (visual check: Row 5, Col 7 is 'A' in the visual? Wait.\n        *   `5 . 0 . . . . A . 1 .`\n        *   x=6 is 'A'. x=8 is '1'.\n        *   x=7 is '.'.\n        *   So (7, 5) is empty.\n        *   Wait, the prompt says `APPLE DROPS: ... (4, 6), (6, 4)...` and the board shows apples at (4, 0), (3, 9), (7, 4), (9, 2)...\n        *   The board visual shows an 'A' at (6, 5)? No.\n        *   Row 5: `5 . 0 . . . . A . 1 .`\n        *   x=6 is 'A'. (6, 5).\n        *   x=8 is '1' (Me).\n        *   x=1 is '0' (Enemy).\n        *   So (7, 5) is empty.\n        *   I want to go to (7, 5) to get closer to (6, 5) or (7, 4).\n        *   Wait, I misread the board. The 'A' at x=6 in row 5 is at (6, 5).\n        *   I am at (8, 5).\n        *   (7, 5) is empty.\n        *   (6, 5) is an Apple.\n        *   (8, 4) is empty.\n        *   (7, 4) is an Apple (Row 4: `4 . 0 . . . . A A . .` -> x=6 'A', x=7 'A').\n        *   Okay, so (7, 5) is a pivot to (6, 5) (Apple) and (7, 4) (Apple).\n        *   (8, 4) is a pivot to (8, 3) (Apple) and (7, 4) (Apple).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (8, 4), I am moving to a cell that is *between* two apples (8, 3) and (7, 4).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7, 5), I am moving to a cell that is *adjacent* to two apples (6, 5) and (7, 4).\n        *   Both are strong options.\n        *   However, (7, 5) allows me to eat an apple *next* turn (either 6,5 or 7,4).\n        *   (8, 4) allows me to eat an apple *next* turn (8,3 or 7,4).\n        *   The difference is the immediate point.\n        *   I need the point. I am 3 vs 5.\n        *   If I don't take the apple at (7, 5), and the opponent takes an apple, I am 3 vs 6.\n        *   That's a huge gap.\n        *   I must take the apple.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nI'm going LEFT to grab that apple and close the score gap! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 13: Eat apple at (7, 5). Score 4. Turn 14: Move to (6, 5) or (7, 4) depending on board state. We need to keep the momentum going and dominate the right side. Don't let Snake #0 get too far ahead!\n\nLEFT",

Also excellent mobility!\n\n4.  **Comparison & Enemy Awareness:**\n    *   **Score:** If I eat either apple, I tie Snake #0 at 5 apples. **I must eat to stay competitive.**\n    *   **Enemy Location:** Snake #0 is still at (1, 6). He is far away on the left side. I am on the right/center.\n    *   **Future Potential:**\n        *   If I go **LEFT (6, 5)**, I open up paths to (6, 6) (Apple), (6, 4) (Apple), and (5, 5) (Empty). This keeps me in a dense apple zone.\n        *   If I go **DOWN (7, 4)**, I open up paths to (6, 4) (Apple), (7, 3) (Empty), and (8, 4) (Empty).\n    *   **The Trap:** I need to watch out for getting boxed in. My body is currently [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]. If I go LEFT to (6, 5), my body fills (7, 5) and (8, 5). This is a solid line. If I go DOWN to (7, 4), my body is (7, 5) and (8, 5). Also solid.\n\n    *   **The Play:** Both moves are safe and score a point. However, **LEFT (6, 5)** moves me directly into the cluster of apples at (6, 6) and (6, 4). It also positions me perfectly to sweep the top row or bottom row next. **DOWN (7, 4)** is good, but LEFT feels like it's taking the center of the apple cluster.\n\n    *   **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** Snake #0 is at (1, 6). He can't reach me this turn. I'm safe.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   I need the point. I need the mobility.\n    *   **LEFT** takes an apple and puts me in a prime position to chain eat.\n    *   Let's secure the point and tie this game up!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 14: Eat apple at (6, 5). Score 5. I'm tied with Snake #0! Next turn, I'll assess (6, 6) vs (6, 4) vs (5, 5). The goal is to keep dominating the right side and avoid the walls. I need to keep my score lead or at least tie it every turn. Don't let him breathe!\n\nLEFT",

I have 4 apples. The enemy has 5 apples. I need to eat this turn to tie the score.\n\n**ANALYZING THE OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 6):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 6: `. T . . . . A . . .` (x=6 is 'A'). It's an apple!\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **Next Turn Options:**\n        *   UP (6, 7): Visual row 7: `. 0 . . A . . . . .` -> '.'

Score becomes 5.\n\n2.  **LEFT (5, 5):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 5: `. T . . . . 1 T T .` (Wait, visual representation is tricky). Let's look at the board map.\n        *   Row 5: `. T . . . . 1 T T .` (x=0 to 9).\n        *   My head is (6, 5). Left is (5, 5).\n        *   The map shows x=5 as '.' (Empty).\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)]. (I don't eat, so I don't grow? Wait, I missed the apple check).\n    *   **Apple Check:** Is there an apple at (5, 5)? Looking at the apple list and board: Row 5 has no 'A' listed in the visual.\n    *   **Correction:** I didn't see an apple at (5, 5). I need to eat to catch up! This move doesn't give me a point. This is bad for catching the score lead.\n\n3.  **DOWN (6, 4):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` (x=6 is 'A'). It's an apple!\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **Next Turn Options:**\n        *   UP (6, 5): My own body (neck). **DEATH.** \u274c\n        *   DOWN (6, 3): Visual row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   LEFT (5, 4): Visual row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   RIGHT (7, 4): Visual row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> 'A' (Apple). SAFE.\n    *   **Result:** 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). I eat an apple. Score becomes 5.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 5):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check: My body is at (7, 5). **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**COMPARISON & STRATEGY:**\n\n*   **Score:** Enemy has 5. I have 4. I **MUST** eat to tie. LEFT is eliminated because it doesn't eat.\n*   **Up vs Down:**\n    *   **UP (6, 6):** Gives 2 safe exits (UP, LEFT). It's a good apple, but \"only\" 2 exits.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 4):** Gives 3 safe exits (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). It's a good apple, and more mobility.\n\n*   **Enemy Awareness:**\n    *   Enemy head is at (1, 7).\n    *   He is far away. No immediate head-on collision threat this turn.\n    *   I need to maximize my survival chances for the long haul. More options = better.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n**DOWN (6, 4)** is the superior move.\n1.  It scores a point (tying 5-5).\n2.  It provides maximum mobility (3 exits) compared to UP (2 exits).\n3.  It keeps me away from the top wall (y=9) and opens up the center of the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 15: Eat apple at (6, 4). Score 5. I'm tied!\nTurn 16: I'll likely head towards (5, 4) or (7, 4) or (6, 3). I need to keep an eye on Snake #0. If he moves aggressively towards the center, I need to cut him off. I'll look to sweep the bottom apples or pivot to the center.\n\nDOWN",

Turn 16 and the game is heating up! \ud83d\udd25 We just tied the score 5-5 with that DOWN move into the apple, and now we're looking to take the lead.\n\nLet's break down the board state. My head is at **(6, 4)**. My body follows: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6)].\n\n**ANALYZING THE OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** That's my own body (neck). **DEATH.** \u274c Can't go backwards into yourself, chat! We're not throwing this game.\n\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` (x=6 is '.'). It's empty!\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **Next Turn Options:**\n        *   UP (6, 4): My own body (tail). **DEATH.** \u274c\n        *   DOWN (6, 2): Visual row 2: `. . . . . . . . . A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   LEFT (5, 3): Visual row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   RIGHT (7, 3): Visual row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n    *   **Result:** 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). No apple here, so score stays 5.\n\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` (x=5 is '.'). It's empty!\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **Next Turn Options:**\n        *   UP (5, 5): Visual row 5: `. T . . . . 1 T T .` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   DOWN (5, 3): Visual row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   LEFT (4, 4): Visual row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   RIGHT (6, 4): My own body (tail). **DEATH.** \u274c\n    *   **Result:** 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). No apple here.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):**\n    *   **Check Safety:** Visual check row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` (x=7 is 'A'). It's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n    *   **New Body:** [(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\n    *   **Next Turn Options:**\n        *   UP (7, 5): My own body (neck). **DEATH.** \u274c\n        *   DOWN (7, 3): Visual row 3: `. T . . . . A . A A` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n        *   LEFT (6, 4): My own body (tail). **DEATH.** \u274c\n        *   RIGHT (8, 4): Visual row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> '.' (Empty). SAFE.\n    *   **Result:** 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). I eat an apple! Score becomes 6.\n\n**COMPARISON & STRATEGY:**\n\n*   **Score:** We are tied at 5. I **MUST** eat to take the lead and pressure the enemy.\n*   **Safety vs. Aggression:**\n    *   **DOWN (6, 3) & LEFT (5, 4):** Both give me 3 safe exits, which is great for mobility. But neither scores. Staying tied means the enemy can catch up easily.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 4):** Scores a point! I take the lead 6-5. It only gives me 2 exits (DOWN, RIGHT), but they are both open and viable. I'll be at (7, 4), which is right next to the wall but still has room to maneuver.\n    *   *Wait, re-checking the map for RIGHT...* Row 4 shows `A A` at x=6 and x=7? Actually looking at the map again: `. T . . . . A A . .` (x=0 to 9). Yes, (6,4) is `.` (my spot), (7,4) is `A`.\n    *   *Wait, looking at the apple list:* `(7, 4)` is indeed listed as an apple drop. YOINK! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n*   **Enemy Awareness:**\n    *   Enemy head is at `(1, 8)`.\n    *   He is far away in the top-left corner. He isn't threatening my immediate space.\n    *   However, the board has apples scattered everywhere. If I don't eat now, he will eventually swoop in and take the lead.\n    *   Taking the lead forces *him* to make risky moves to catch up. That's how we box him in.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\n**RIGHT (7, 4)** is the move!\n1.  **Aggression:** I take the apple and go up 6-5. We lead the scoreboard! \ud83c\udfc6\n2.  **Positioning:** While (7, 4) is near the right wall, looking at the board, the apples are mostly in the center and top. Moving Right sets me up to scan the right side of the board.\n3.  **Future Moves:** From (7, 4), I have DOWN (empty) and RIGHT (empty). If I go DOWN to (7, 3), I can then pivot LEFT or DOWN again. If I go RIGHT to (8, 4), I can go DOWN or RIGHT again. It's tight, but manageable.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTurn 16: Eat apple at (7, 4). Score 6-5.\nTurn 17: I'll likely head DOWN to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 4) depending on the board state. I need to start sweeping the bottom-right quadrant. I'll keep an eye on Snake #0. If he moves toward the center apples, I need to cut him off. I must maintain the lead!\n\nRIGHT",

I am effectively chasing the apples on the right side.\n\n    *   **Final decision:** DOWN.\n    *   It's the most flexible move.\n\n    *   **One last check:** Is (7,3) occupied?\n    *   Map says `.`.\n    *   Enemy is at (2,8).\n    *   My body is elsewhere.\n    *   It's clear.\n\n    *   **Wait, I see an apple at (7,0).**\n    *   If I go DOWN to (7,3), I can go DOWN to (7,2), (7,1), (7,0).\n    *   (7,0) is an apple.\n    *   This is a good vertical path.\n\n    *   **Contrast with RIGHT:**\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (8,4), I can go DOWN to (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (8,0).\n    *   (8,0) is an apple.\n    *   Both paths lead to an apple at the bottom.\n\n    *   **Why is DOWN better?**\n    *   (7,3) is not on the wall.\n    *   (8,4) is one step away from the wall.\n    *   (7,3) allows me to pivot LEFT or RIGHT.\n    *   (8,4) locks me into RIGHT or DOWN.\n\n    *   **The \"Box him in\" strategy:**\n    *   I need to be mobile.

The enemy is lurking at (3, 8), but I've got the center control and the apples are right in my path. Let's break this down!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (7, 3)\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 8) - He's up top, not an immediate threat to my play down here.\n*   **Board Map Check:** Row 3 is `. . . . . . A . A A`. That's (6,3) Apple, (8,3) Apple, (9,3) Apple. Row 4 is `. T . . . . A A . .` (Wait, actually looking at the text map: Row 4 is `. T . . . . A A . .`. But my head is at (7,3) now, so Row 3 is my current row.\n    *   **Row 3 (y=3):** `. . . . . . A . A A` -> (6,3) is `A`, (8,3) is `A`, (9,3) is `A`.\n    *   **Row 4 (y=4):** `. T . . . . A A . .` -> (6,4) is `A`, (7,4) is `A`.\n    *   **Row 5 (y=5):** `. T . . . . T T T .` -> (6,5) is `T` (Body), (7,5) is `T`, (8,5) is `T`.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 4) is currently an `A` on the map, but looking at my body list: `[(7, 4), ...]`. Wait, my body list starts with (7,4)? No, let's check the list again: `Head: (7, 3), Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)]`.\n    *   **DEATH.** My head moves into my own body segment. \u274c\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 2 (y=2) is `. . . . . . . . . A`. (7,2) is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **Future:** From (7,2), I can go DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2), or RIGHT (8,2).\n    *   **Apple Check:** (7,1) has an apple `(7, 0)`? No, (7,0) is an apple. (7,1) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is a safe move, but it moves me *away* from the cluster of apples at (6,3), (8,3), (9,3). I want to dominate the board, not run away.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 3: (6,3) is `A`.\n    *   **Apple Check:** YES! `(6, 3)` is in the apple list.\n    *   **Growth:** Eating an apple keeps my tail longer (or rather, I grow, so my tail doesn't move forward). This keeps my body presence on the board.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (6,3), I can go UP (6,4), DOWN (6,2), or LEFT (5,3).\n        *   (6,4) is an apple (Row 4 shows `A` at x=6).\n        *   (6,2) is empty.\n        *   (5,3) is empty.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy is at (3,8). He is far. He cannot crash into me next turn.\n    *   **Verdict:** This is a strong move. It secures a point, grows my snake, and keeps me in the central lanes.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 3: (8,3) is `A`.\n    *   **Apple Check:** YES! `(8, 3)` is in the apple list.\n    *   **Growth:** +1 Point!\n    *   **Future Options:** From (8,3), I can go UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), or RIGHT (9,3).\n        *   (9,3) is also an apple!\n        *   (8,4) is empty (Row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> x=8 is `.`).\n        *   (8,2) is empty.\n    *   **Verdict:** This is ALSO a strong move. It eats an apple and puts me directly next to another apple at (9,3).\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nWe have two \"Golden Paths\":\n*   **Path A (LEFT):** Eat (6,3). Next turn options: Eat (6,4) or (5,3).\n*   **Path B (RIGHT):** Eat (8,3). Next turn options: Eat (9,3) or (8,4).\n\n**Which is better?**\nThe enemy is at (3,8). He is chasing apples in the top left `(3,9)`.\nIf I go **LEFT to (6,3)**, I am moving towards the center-left.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8,3)**, I am moving towards the center-right.\n\nLooking at the board map:\nRow 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> (6,4) is `A`, (7,4) is `A`.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . A . A A` -> (6,3) is `A`, (8,3) is `A`, (9,3) is `A`.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8,3)**:\n1.  Eat apple at (8,3).\n2.  Next turn, I can go **RIGHT to (9,3)** to eat *another* apple immediately.\n3.  This creates a rapid chain of growth and keeps me on the right side, potentially cutting off the enemy if he tries to cross over (unlikely, but good positioning).\n4.  From (9,3), I have access to the top right corner `(9,9)` (apple listed) and bottom right.\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (6,3)**:\n1.  Eat apple at (6,3).\n2.  Next turn, I can go **UP to (6,4)** to eat another apple immediately.\n3.  This is also a rapid chain.\n\n**Why RIGHT is slightly better right now:**\nThe apple at (9,3) is at the edge. If I don't take it now, the enemy might path towards it later (though he's far).\nMore importantly, looking at my body: `(8,5), (8,6)`.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,3) -> (9,3) -> (9,4) -> (9,5), I am sliding down the right wall.\nThis clears my current body (8,5), (8,6) out of the way eventually.\n\nActually, looking at the map strictly:\n(9,3) is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT (6,3), I eat (6,3).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (6,4) (Apple).\nNext turn, I can go UP to (6,5).\n(6,5) is currently `T` (My body). Wait.\nRow 5: `. T . . . . T T T .`\n(6,5) is `T`.\nIf I am at (6,4) (Head), and I go UP to (6,5)...\n(6,5) is currently occupied by my body. **DEATH.**\n\nSo, if I go **LEFT**:\nTurn 18: (6,3) (Eat)\nTurn 19: (6,4) (Eat)\nTurn 20: I cannot go UP to (6,5). I must go LEFT (5,4) or DOWN (6,2).\nThis is fine, but it limits the \"UP\" direction immediately.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT**:\nTurn 18: (8,3) (Eat)\nTurn 19: (9,3) (Eat)\nTurn 20: From (9,3), I can go UP (9,4).\n(9,4) is empty (Row 4: `. T . . . . A A . .` -> x=9 is `.`).\nTurn 21: From (9,4), I can go UP (9,5).\n(9,5) is empty (Row 5: `. T . . . . T T T .` -> x=9 is `.`).\nTurn 22: From (9,5), I can go UP (9,6).\n(9,6) is empty (Row 6: `. T . . A . . . T .` -> x=9 is `.`).\n\nThe **RIGHT** path gives me a cleaner \"runway\" along the right edge to consume apples and grow safely without immediate body collision issues. The LEFT path hits my own body wall at (6,5) very quickly.\n\n**Final Decision:** Go **RIGHT** to (8,3). Eat the apple. Set up the chain to (9,3) and the right edge.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (8,3) -> Eat (9,3) -> Run up the right wall (9,4 -> 9,5 -> 9,6 -> 9,7 -> 9,8 -> 9,9). This secures the apples on the right side and keeps the enemy (who is on the left) separated. Once we hit 30 apples or the enemy dies, we win. DOMINATE THE EDGES!\n\n**WAIT!**\nLet me check the map one last time.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . A . A A`\n(9,3) is an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,3), I eat.\nNext turn I go RIGHT to (9,3), I eat.\nNext turn I go UP to (9,4). Safe.\nThis is the plan. It's solid.\n\n**Enemy Move Prediction:**\nSnake #0 is at (3,8). He has apples at (3,9) (UP) and (4,8) (RIGHT) or (2,8) (LEFT).\nHe will likely go UP to (3,9) to eat.\nHe is nowhere near me.\n\n**MOVE:**\nRIGHT\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We are taking the right side! Let's gooooo!\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the apples in the center/right. Not ideal for maximizing score right now.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH.** That is my current body segment. I would crash into myself. \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 3 shows `(9,3)` is an `A` (Apple). It is empty of body parts.\n    *   **Growth:** **I EAT AN APPLE!** +1 Point. Score becomes 8-7 (assuming enemy didn't eat this turn, but we move simultaneously so we'll see). More importantly, I grow, keeping my tail on the board longer.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (9,3), I can go UP to (9,4) or DOWN to (9,2). Both are currently empty on the map.\n        *   (9,2) is an apple listed in the drops!\n        *   (9,9) is an apple listed in the drops!\n    *   **Dominance:** This locks down the entire right edge of the board. The enemy is on the left (3,9). I have a clear runway up the right wall (9,4 -> 9,5 -> 9,6...) that avoids my current body completely.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe move **RIGHT** is the only option that allows me to eat an apple *and* secure a massive open space for future growth. Moving UP into the center (8,4) is risky because it puts me right next to my own body density. Moving RIGHT sets me up on a highway to the top right corner apples ((9,9)) and keeps the enemy on the opposite side of the map.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat (9,3) -> Move UP to (9,4) -> Move UP to (9,5)... Ride the right wall all the way to (9,9). Box the enemy in the left corner and wait for him to crash or timeout. Dominate the edges!\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is still at (4,9) and I'm holding the right side. Let's analyze the board!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (9, 3) - Just ate the apple here!\n*   **My Body:** [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)] - My tail is at (8,6), so the cell behind me is safe to move into if needed.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 9) - Still stuck at the top-left wall.\n*   **The Board:**\n    *   Row 3: `. . . . . . . . . 1` -> My head at (9,3).\n    *   Row 4: `. . . . . . A A . .` -> (6,4) and (7,4) are apples.\n    *   Row 2: `. . . . . . . . . A` -> (9,2) is an apple!\n    *   Row 1: `. . . A A . . . . .` -> Apples at (3,1) and (4,1).\n    *   Row 0: `. A A . A . . A A .` -> Many apples, but I'm far away.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 4 shows (9,4) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me along the wall. (9,4) is adjacent to my body at (8,5) and (8,6), but not directly hitting them. From here, I can continue UP to (9,5), (9,6)... all the way to (9,9) which is an apple. This is the \"Highway to the Top\" strategy. This keeps my movement options open along the edge.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 2 shows (9,2) is an **APPLE (A)**. Safe to move.\n    *   **Growth:** **I EAT AN APPLE!** +1 Point. Score becomes 9-7.\n    *   **Strategy:** Eating is good for points, but moving DOWN into (9,2) is a slight dead end. From (9,2), my only safe forward options are UP (back to 9,3, which will be my body) or LEFT (9,1). LEFT is a dead end (wall at 9,0 is empty but trapped). This move forces me into a corner later.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (8,3) is currently my **BODY**. This would be a head-on collision with myself. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** X-coordinate 10 is off the board. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nI need to avoid getting boxed in. Moving DOWN to (9,2) gets me an apple immediately, but it puts me in a very tight spot on the bottom-right corner where my escape routes are limited (only Up or Left). Moving **UP to (9,4)** keeps me on the wall and maintains an open path to the top-right corner where (9,9) sits waiting. The apple at (9,2) isn't going anywhere for a while, but the path to (9,9) requires momentum. If I go down now, I might lose the race to the top apples if the enemy decides to sweep the right side later. Staying high keeps the enemy guessing and keeps my tail moving freely without trapping myself.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRide the wall UP. (9,4) -> (9,5) -> (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (9,9). Claim the entire right edge. Force the enemy to deal with my growing length while he's stuck in the top-left. If he approaches, I can drop down the middle or finish him off.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

No chance of a head\u2011on clash this turn.\n\n**Why DOWN wins:**  \n\n| Move | Immediate gain | Apple proximity | Future mobility | Long\u2011term pressure |\n|------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| **DOWN** \u2192 (4,\u202f8) | No apple now, but **(4,\u202f7)** and **(4,\u202f6)** are ripe apples just two steps away. | \u2705 Grab two close apples, grow fast, boost score. | After the move I\u2019ll have three exit squares (down, right, stay\u2011up\u2011blocked).

This keeps my score climbing and preserves escape routes.\n\n**Bottom line:** the safest, most aggressive, and highest\u2011reward move is **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Let's analyze the board for Turn 21.\n\n**CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **My Head:** (9, 4) - Just moved here safely.\n*   **My Body:** My tail is currently at (8, 6) based on the board visual (where the 'T' is). This means (8, 6) is vacating this turn, which is great news because it opens up the cell behind my head.\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 8) - The opponent has moved DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8). They are still trapped in the top-left corner.\n*   **Score:** 8-7 (I'm winning). If I die now, I lose. If we both die, I win. If he dies, I win.\n\n**MOVEMENT OPTIONS:**\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Looking at the board, (9, 5) is currently a 'T' (my own body). Since my tail at (8, 6) is moving away, the cell (8, 5) remains occupied. However, (9, 5) is definitely occupied by my body segment (the visual shows `T T T` on row 5). Moving UP into (9, 5) is hitting my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (9, 3) was my head on the previous turn. Since I just left it, it is empty (unless the enemy moves there, but they are far away). However, looking at the board logic: My body occupies (9, 3) in the *current* frame? No, (9, 3) is my *previous* head position. Wait, the board shows row 3: `. . . . . . A T T T`. Actually, looking at the provided board state for the *current* turn (Turn 21 start), my body is listed as `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3)...]`. So (9, 3) is currently part of my body (specifically the neck).\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** If I move DOWN to (9, 3), I am moving into a cell occupied by my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Looking at the board, (8, 4) is a 'T'. Specifically, the board shows row 4: `. . . . . . T T . 1`. (8, 4) is a body segment.\n    *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Moving LEFT hits my own body. **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** X-coordinate 10 is off the board (0-9). **DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**STRATEGIC REALIZATION:**\nWait... am I trapped?\nLet's look at the board state again carefully.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . T T . 1`\nCoordinates:\n(6,4) = T\n(7,4) = T\n(8,4) = T\n(9,4) = 1 (Me)\n\nSo I am surrounded by my own body to the LEFT, UP, and DOWN?\nLet's check the specific coordinates of my body list:\nHead: (9, 4)\nBody: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5)]\n\nLet's map the grid at y=4:\n(6,4) = Body\n(7,4) = Body\n(8,4) = **???**\n(9,4) = Me\n\nThe body list doesn't explicitly show (8,4), but the board visual shows `T T . 1` on row 4.\nWait, let's re-read the board visual for row 4:\n`4 . . . . . . T T . 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (6,4) is T, (7,4) is T, (8,4) is . (Empty!), (9,4) is 1.\n\nOkay, (8, 4) is EMPTY.\nWhat about (9, 5)? Row 5: `. . A . . . T T T .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(9, 5) is . (Empty).\n\nWhat about (9, 3)? Row 3: `. . . . . . A T T T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(9, 3) is T (Body).\n\n**CORRECTED ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (9, 5):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN (9, 3):** Body. **DEATH.**\n*   **LEFT (8, 4):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT (10, 4):** Wall. **DEATH.**\n\n**DECISION: UP vs LEFT**\n*   **LEFT to (8, 4):** This moves me into the gap between the wall and my body at (7, 4). From (8, 4), I am sandwiched. My body is at (7, 4) and (6, 4). I can go DOWN to (8, 3) (which is currently body, but might move?), or UP to (8, 5) (currently body). Moving LEFT squeezes me into a position where I have very limited mobility. I might get boxed in by my own tail.\n*   **UP to (9, 5):** This moves me UP along the right wall. From (9, 5), I can continue UP to (9, 6) (currently empty? No, row 6: `. T . . . . . . . .` -> (1,6) is T, (9,6) is Empty). Wait, looking at row 6: `. T . . . . . . . .`, (9, 6) is empty. This is the \"Highway to the Top\" strategy. It keeps me on the edge where I have more space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRide the right wall UP. I need to escape the congestion in the bottom-right corner. Moving UP gives me access to the top-right apples ((9,9) is an apple) and keeps my body stretched out vertically, which is harder for the enemy to trap.\n\n**AGGRESSION CHECK:**\nEnemy is at (4, 8). I am winning 8-7. I should stay alive and grow. Moving UP aligns with claiming territory.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nMove UP to (9, 5). It's the only safe move that doesn't trap me immediately.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

T T . 1`\n            *   (9,4) is '1' (Current Head). Wait, I am currently at (9,5). Moving down to (9,4) puts me where I just was.\n            *   **Body Logic:** My body list is `[(9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)]`.\n            *   The cell (9,4) is explicitly listed as part of my body (the second segment, the neck). Since I move simultaneously, that body part moves *with* me? No, the head leaves, the body follows.\n            *   Wait, the rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)?

DEATH. \u274c\n\n2.  **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n    *   **The ONLY safe move is UP.** I am forced to move UP to (9, 6).\n    *   **Positioning:** Moving UP stretches my body vertically along the right wall. This is excellent for \"Thinning the snake\" or increasing reach.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (4, 7). They are trapped in the top-left quadrant (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)... they have very little room. They cannot reach me in the top-right.\n    *   **Goal:** I need to clear the board. The apple at (9,9) is tempting. From (9,6), I can head toward (9,9) and eventually loop down to clear the rest of the board.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nRide the right wall UP towards (9,9). Once I eat (9,9), I will have 9 apples. Then I can sweep down the left side (0,0 to 0,9) while keeping my body tight. The enemy is cornered; I just need to stay alive and pick off apples.\n\n**AGGRESSION:** I am winning. I will eat the apples. The enemy is stuck in a box.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nThere is no choice.

Let's break down the battlefield!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- Our snake stretches up the right side: (9,7)\u2192(9,6)\u2192(9,5)\u2192(9,4)\u2192(9,3)\u2192(8,3)\u2192(7,3)\u2192(7,4)\u2192(6,4)\n- Enemy snake #0 sits at (4,5) with a long vertical body: (4,6)\u2192(4,7)\u2192(4,8)\u2192(4,9)\u2192(3,9)\u2192...\u2192(1,7)\n- Apples available: (9,9) is close but guarded by enemy tail at (4,9)? Wait, (9,9) is free! (8,8) is also nearby. (6,7) is close too.\n\n**Eliminating Bad Moves:**\n- **LEFT** to (8,7): Check board state at (8,7) - there's an 'A' (apple) according to the board! But wait, is (8,7) occupied? Board shows row 7: \". T . . T . A . A 1\" so (8,7) is position 8 in row 7 = 'A'. That's an apple! But we need to check if any snake body is there. Our body: we have (8,3) but not (8,7). Enemy body: they have (1,7) but not (8,7). So LEFT to (8,7) is safe and eats an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- **RIGHT** to (10,7): That's off the board (x=10), instant death. NO!\n\n- **DOWN** to (9,6): Check (9,6) - our own body! Our second segment is (9,6). Moving DOWN into our own body = death. NO!\n\n- **UP** to (9,8): Check (9,8) - board shows row 8: \". T T T T . . . A .\" (9,8) is position 9 in row 8 = '.' (empty). Enemy body? No. Our body? No. So UP to (9,8) is safe but no apple.\n\n**Wait, hold up!** The board state shows at row 7, column 8 (which is (8,7)) has an 'A'! Let me double-check the board representation:\n\nBoard:\nRow 9: 9 A . . T T . . . . A\nRow 8: . T T T T . . . A .\nRow 7: . T . . T . A . A 1  \u2190 This is y=7\nRow 6: . . . . T . . . . T\nRow 5: . . A . 0 . . . . T\nRow 4: . . . . . . T T . T\nRow 3: . . . . . . A T T T\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\nRow 1: . . . A A . . . . .\nRow 0: . A A . A . . A A .\n\nCoordinates: x from 0-9 left to right, y from 0-9 bottom to top.\n\nSo row 7 (y=7): positions 0-9: . T . . T . A . A 1\n- (0,7) = '.'\n- (1,7) = 'T' (enemy tail part)\n- (2,7) = '.'\n- (3,7) = '.'\n- (4,7) = 'T' (enemy body)\n- (5,7) = '.'\n- (6,7) = 'A' (apple!)\n- (7,7) = '.'\n- (8,7) = 'A' (apple!)\n- (9,7) = '1' (our head)\n\nSo (8,7) is an apple! And (6,7) is also an apple!\n\nBut wait, our head is at (9,7). If we move LEFT to (8,7), we'd be moving to an apple position. Is (8,7) occupied? No snakes there. So LEFT is safe and gets us an apple!\n\n**Strategy:** We want to dominate and force a head-on collision since we're only 1 apple behind. But first, we need to grow! The apple at (8,7) is right there! That would tie us at 9 apples each.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Get the apple at (8,7) to tie the score. Then use our position on the right edge to cut off the enemy's access to the top-right apples like (9,9) and (8,8). The enemy is stuck on the left side with their long body - we can box them in from the right.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT to (8,7) is the move! It's safe, gets us an apple, and sets up a tie in score. We're playing aggressive but smart. Let's gooooo!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down the battlefield!\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- Our snake now: Head at (8,7), Body: [(9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4)]\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (4,4), Body: [(4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]\n- Key apples: (6,7) is right above us, (9,9) is top-right corner, (8,8) is nearby, (6,3) is close to our tail area.\n\n**Eliminating Bad Moves:**\n- **RIGHT** to (9,7): Check (9,7) - that's currently our body (first segment)! Moving into our own body = death. NO!\n- **UP** to (8,8): Check board at (8,8). Row 8: \". T T T T . . . A .\" So (8,8) = 'A' (apple!) AND there's no snake body there. Safe move that gets an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN** to (8,6): Check (8,6). Row 6: \". . . . T . . . . T\" so (8,6) = '.' (empty). Safe but no apple.\n- **LEFT** to (7,7): Check (7,7). Row 7: \". T . . T . A . A 1\" so (7,7) = '.' (empty). Safe but no apple.\n\n**Strategy Check:** We want to DOMINATE! Taking the apple at (8,8) would give us 10 apples to enemy's 9. That's a LEAD! Plus, (8,8) is positionally CRITICAL - it's between the enemy and the top-right corner apples (9,9). By taking (8,8), we start boxing them in from the right side!\n\n**Long-term plan:** Grab (8,8) for the lead. Then use our position on the right edge to control access to (9,9) and other top-right apples. The enemy is stuck in the left half - we can wall them off!\n\n**Decision:** UP to (8,8) is the move! It's safe, gets us an apple, and gives us the LEAD in a tie game! Let's GOOOOOOO!\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**Board State Check:**\n- Our snake (ID 1): Head at (8,8), Body: [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4)]\n- Enemy snake #0: Head at (5,4), Body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (2,8)]\n- Apples: We just ate (8,8), so remaining apples are: (4,0), (9,2), (8,0), (6,3), (4,1), (9,9), (2,0), (7,0), (0,9), (3,1), (2,5), (1,0), (6,7), (0,8), (6,1)\n\n**Eliminating Bad Moves:**\n- **DOWN** to (8,7): That's our body! Immediate death. NO!\n- **RIGHT** to (9,8): Check board row 9: \"A . . T T . . . . .\" So (9,8) = '.' empty. Safe? But wait... let's check the full picture.\n- **UP** to (8,9): Row 9 shows (8,9) = '.' empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (7,8): Row 8 shows (7,8) = '.' empty. Safe.\n\n**Immediate Threat Assessment:**\nWe need to consider what the enemy might do. Their head is at (5,4). They could move UP to (5,5), DOWN to (5,3), LEFT to (4,4) [which is their body], or RIGHT to (6,4) [which is our tail!].\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (6,4), they'd crash into our tail - they die! But if we move LEFT to (7,8), we're safe regardless of their move.\n\n**Strategic Positioning:**\n- (8,9) is the top-right corner! That's a DEAD END. If we go there, next turn we'd be forced to move DOWN to (8,8) (our previous spot) or LEFT to (7,9). (7,9) might be empty, but corner trapping is risky.\n- (9,8) is better - we can go to (9,9) next for that apple, or back to (9,7) or (8,8). More options.\n- (7,8) puts us closer to the center and gives us access to multiple apples. We can go UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), or RIGHT to (8,8).\n\n**Domination Strategy:**\nWe're LEADING! We should play defensively to maintain our lead while cutting off enemy access. The enemy is trapped in the left half - we should keep control of the right side.\n\nThe apple at (9,9) is valuable but cornered. The apple at (9,2) is on the right edge but lower. The apple at (6,7) is near our current position.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to (7,8) gives us the most future options and keeps us away from dangerous corners. It also maintains distance from the enemy's potential path. From (7,8), we can still access (6,7) apple, control the right side, and have multiple escape routes.\n\nLong-term plan: Maintain our lead, keep the enemy boxed in the left half, and slowly dominate the board from the right side. Don't give them any chance to catch up!\n\nLEFT",

Safe! Opens up access to (6,9) and (8,9).\n\n- **LEFT to (6,8)**: Row 8 shows (6,8) = '.' empty. Safe! Gets us closer to the center.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n\nEnemy is at (5,3). They could:\n- Move RIGHT to (6,3) - but that's an apple! They'd eat and grow!\n- Move UP to (5,4) - that's their own body! DEAD!\n- Move DOWN to (5,2) - empty\n- Move LEFT to (4,3) - empty but risky\n\n**If we go UP to (7,9)**: We're on the top edge, near the apple at (9,9) and can control the top right. But we might get cornered.\n\n**If we go DOWN to (7,7)**: Opens up (6,7) apple access! That's smart. Enemy likely won't reach us there.\n\n**If we go LEFT to (6,8)**: This is the move! We get closer to the center, maintain distance from the enemy, and keep our options wide open. From (6,8) we can go in ANY direction next turn, and we're still controlling the right side while the enemy is stuck on the left.\n\n**DECISION:** LEFT to (6,8) gives us maximum flexibility, keeps us safe from the enemy's likely moves, and maintains our territorial advantage. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Keep the enemy boxed in the left half. Control the center and right side. When they try to break out, we cut them off. Force them into a corner while we dominate the apples. \n\nLet's gooooo! \ud83d\udca5\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We're in a tight spot here, but we're still tied 10-10 with the enemy! Let's analyze the board state and find our winning move.\n\n**TURN 28 ANALYSIS:**\n- My Head: (6, 8)\n- Enemy Head: (6, 3) - They moved RIGHT last turn!\n- My Body: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3)]\n- Enemy Body: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8)]\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK:**\nRow 8: (6,8) is currently empty! Perfect.\nRow 7: (6,7) has an apple at (6,7) from the list!\nRow 9: (6,9) is empty (Row 9 shows ...T T . . . A)\nRow 6: (6,6) is empty (Row 6 shows . . . . T . . . . T)\n\n**MOVES FROM (6,8):**\n1. **UP to (6,9)**: Row 9 shows (6,9) = '.' empty. Safe! Opens up top edge.\n2. **DOWN to (6,7)**: Row 7 shows (6,7) = 'A' (Apple from the list!). If I eat it, I GROW to 11! But wait...\n3. **LEFT to (5,8)**: Row 8 shows (5,8) = '.' empty. Safe!\n4. **RIGHT to (7,8)**: Row 8 shows (7,8) = '1' (My own body!). DEAD! \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL MOMENT - THE DOWN MOVE:**\nIf I go DOWN to (6,7), I eat an apple and grow to 11! But the enemy is at (6,3). They could move UP to (6,4) or UP to (6,5) or UP to (6,6) or UP to (6,7)... WAIT! \n\nIf enemy moves UP 4 times in a row (which is impossible in 1 turn), they'd hit (6,7). But they can only move 1 cell this turn. From (6,3), they could move:\n- UP to (6,4) - safe\n- DOWN to (6,2) - safe  \n- LEFT to (5,3) - safe (their body is at (5,3) but that's their head's current position, not body)\n- RIGHT to (7,3) - wait! (7,3) is MY body! Enemy would die if they go RIGHT!\n\nSo if I go DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple, enemy CANNOT reach me this turn. They're too far!\n\n**BUT WAIT** - There's a bigger threat! If I go DOWN to (6,7), I'm on an apple, but what about NEXT turn? From (6,7), my options would be limited. I'd be sandwiched between enemy at (6,3) and my own body.\n\nActually, let me think about the DOWN move more carefully. The apple at (6,7) is there, and I can get it safely THIS turn. But then I'll have one more segment and be at (6,7). From there, I need to think about future moves...\n\nActually, let's check the enemy's potential moves more carefully. From (6,3), they could:\n- Move UP to (6,4) \n- Move DOWN to (6,2)\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n- Move RIGHT to (7,3) - but (7,3) is part of MY body!\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (7,3), they die! That's their head moving into my body. So they probably won't do that unless they're desperate.\n\n**STRATEGIC DECISION:**\nThe apple at (6,7) is RIGHT THERE and I can get it safely. Taking it gives me 11 apples vs their 10. That's a lead! From (6,7), I can then assess next moves. The apple is valuable for score AND for growth to control space.\n\n**BUT THERE'S A HUGE RISK I'M MISSING:** What if the enemy also moves UP multiple steps? No, they can only move 1 cell this turn. I'm safe to eat this apple!\n\nWait, let me double-check the board state. Looking at Row 7: \". . A . T . A . . . T T\" - positions: (2,7) is empty? No, let me count:\nIndex 0: '.' (0,7)\nIndex 1: '.' (1,7)\nIndex 2: 'A' (2,7) - apple\nIndex 3: '.' (3,7)\nIndex 4: 'T' (4,7) - enemy body\nIndex 5: '.' (5,7)\nIndex 6: 'A' (6,7) - apple\nIndex 7: '.' (7,7)\nIndex 8: '.' (8,7) - wait, (8,7) is my body? No, my body at (8,7) is from my previous path...\n\nActually, looking at my body list: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3)]\nSo (8,7) IS my body. But in Row 7, index 8 would be (8,7) which shows as '.' in the board? \n\nWait, the board shows Row 7 as: \". . A . T . A . . . T T\"\nPositions: (0,7) to (9,7):\n(0,7): '.'\n(1,7): '.'\n(2,7): 'A'\n(3,7): '.'\n(4,7): 'T'\n(5,7): '.'\n(6,7): 'A'\n(7,7): '.'\n(8,7): '.'\n(9,7): 'T'\n\nBut my body list shows (8,7) and (9,7) as my body segments! There's a discrepancy. Let me check again...\n\nLooking at my body: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), ...]\nSo (8,7) and (9,7) are indeed my body. But the board shows them as '.' and 'T'? That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the board is showing the state AFTER my last move? No, it says \"Board state\" which should be current.\n\nLet me re-examine my last move. I went LEFT from (7,8) to (6,8). So my head is now at (6,8). My body follows: (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), etc.\n\nSo the board should show my head at (6,8) and my body at those positions. Let me check Row 8:\nRow 8: \"A . . T T . 1 T T .\" \nPositions: (0,8) to (9,8):\n(0,8): 'A'\n(1,8): '.'\n(2,8): '.'\n(3,8): 'T'\n(4,8): 'T'\n(5,8): '.'\n(6,8): '1' \u2190 MY HEAD! Yes, it shows '1' which is me!\n(7,8): 'T' \u2190 Wait, this should be my body but it shows 'T' (enemy)\n(8,8): 'T' \u2190 This should be my body but shows 'T'\n(9,8): '.'\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The board shows (7,8) and (8,8) as 'T' (enemy), but my body list shows them as my segments. \n\nLet me check Row 9: \"9 A . . T T . . . . A\"\n(0,9): 'A'\n(1,9): '.'\n(2,9): '.'\n(3,9): 'T'\n(4,9): 'T'\n(5,9): '.'\n(6,9): '.'\n(7,9): '.'\n(8,9): '.'\n(9,9): 'A'\n\nMy body includes (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3). Let me check those rows...\n\nRow 7: (9,7) shows 'T' - good, that's my body.\nRow 6: (9,6) shows 'T' - good.\nRow 5: (9,5) shows 'T' - good.\nRow 4: (9,4) shows 'T' - good.\nRow 3: (9,3) shows 'T' - but wait, Row 3 shows: \". . . . . . T 0 T T T\"\n(6,3): 'T'? No, (6,3) is the enemy head! Let me check...\nRow 3: indices 0-9: (0,3):'.', (1,3):'.', (2,3):'.', (3,3):'.', (4,3):'.', (5,3):'.', (6,3):'T', (7,3):'0', (8,3):'T', (9,3):'T'\nBut the enemy head is at (6,3), not (7,3)! The board shows (7,3) as '0' which should be the enemy head, but the enemy head is at (6,3)!\n\nThere's definitely some confusion in the board state representation. Let me trust the explicit coordinates given in the state rather than the ASCII board for precise positions.\n\nGiven:\n- My head: (6,8)\n- Enemy head: (6,3)\n- My body includes (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), etc.\n- Enemy body includes (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n\n**MOVES FROM (6,8):**\n1. **UP to (6,9)**: Empty (based on board row 9). Safe.\n2. **DOWN to (6,7)**: Apple at (6,7)! Safe if enemy doesn't reach it.\n3. **LEFT to (5,8)**: Empty (Row 8 shows (5,8) = '.'). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (7,8)**: My own body! DEAD.\n\n**THE ENEMY'S SITUATION:**\nEnemy at (6,3). If they move RIGHT to (7,3), that's where my body is! They'd die. So they probably won't do that.\nThey could move UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), or LEFT to (5,3).\n\n**THE APPLE AT (6,7):**\nThis apple is accessible and safe this turn. If I go DOWN, I eat it and grow to 11. Then I'm at (6,7) and can plan next moves. The apple is right there - taking it gives me the lead and adds a segment.\n\nFrom (6,7) next turn, I could:\n- Go UP back to (6,8) (but that'll be my body by then)\n- Go DOWN to (6,6) \n- Go LEFT to (5,7)\n- Go RIGHT to (7,7)\n\nActually, wait. If I go DOWN to (6,7) and eat the apple, my body becomes: (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), etc.\nSo (6,8) becomes my first body segment. From (6,7) next turn, I CANNOT go UP to (6,8) because that's where my body will be!\n\nThis is critical! If I eat the apple at (6,7), I trap myself. From (6,7), my options would be:\n- UP: blocked by my own body at (6,8)\n- DOWN: to (6,6) - empty\n- LEFT: to (5,7) - empty  \n- RIGHT: to (7,7) - empty\n\nSo I'd have 3 options, which is still okay, but I'd be more constrained.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: GO LEFT to (5,8)**\nIf I go LEFT to (5,8), I don't eat an apple, but I stay flexible. From (5,8), I can go:\n- UP to (5,9) - empty (Row 9 shows (5,9) = '.')\n- DOWN to (5,7) - empty\n- LEFT to (4,8) - but (4,8) is enemy body! DEAD!\n- RIGHT to (6,8) - empty (but will be my body)\n\nSo from (5,8), I have 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Less flexible than from (6,8).\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: GO UP to (6,9)**\nIf I go UP to (6,9), I stay safe. From (6,9), I can go:\n- DOWN to (6,8) - empty (but will be my body)\n- LEFT to (5,9) - empty\n- RIGHT to (7,9) - empty\n\n3 options from (6,9). Good flexibility.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: GO DOWN to (6,7) - THE APPLE**\nIf I go DOWN, I get +1 apple and grow. From (6,7), I have 3 options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) as UP is blocked by my body.\n\n**DECISION TIME:**\nThe apple at (6,7) is there for the taking. Getting to 11 apples vs their 10 is important. Yes, I'll be slightly more constrained next turn, but I'll have the lead and an extra segment.\n\nBut wait! Let me think about the enemy's position. They're at (6,3). If I'm at (6,7), that's 4 cells away vertically. They could potentially chase me up the middle. But if I'm at (6,9) or (5,8), I maintain better distance.\n\nActually, there's another consideration: the apple at (6,7) might be contested later. If I don't take it now, the enemy could potentially get to it in a few turns (they'd need 4 moves to reach it). But I can get it in 1 move.\n\n**I'M GOING FOR THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e\nI'm taking the apple at (6,7). This gives me the lead (11-10) and an extra segment. Even though it limits my UP move next turn, I'll still have 3 directions available. The score lead is crucial for forcing head-on collisions later.\n\nFrom (6,7) next turn, I'll assess the enemy's position and choose the best path forward. The apple is mine!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get the lead, then start boxing the enemy in. With an extra segment, I can cut off more paths. Force them into a corner while I control the center-right.\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze this board and make a game-winning move! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- My head: (6, 7) - I ate that apple last turn! LET'S GO! \ud83c\udf4e\n- My body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3)]\n- Enemy head: (6, 2) - They're below me, still in the middle!\n- Enemy body: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)]\n\n**MOVES FROM (6, 7):**\n1. **UP to (6, 8)**: That's MY BODY! I just moved from there last turn. I'd die instantly! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (6, 6)**: Empty? Let me check... Row 6 shows \".\" at (6,6) - SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (5, 7)**: Empty? Row 7 shows \".\" at (5,7) - SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: Empty? Row 7 shows \".\" at (7,7) - SAFE! \u2705\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\nThe UP move is instant death - I'm blocked by my own body! So I have 3 safe options: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY'S POSITION:**\nThey're at (6, 2). If they move UP to (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), or (6, 6), they could potentially move toward me. BUT...\n\n**THE TRAP I'M SEEING:**\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6), I'm moving CLOSER to the enemy! From (6, 6), they could reach me in 4 turns. If I go LEFT to (5, 7), I'm moving AWAY from them and toward the left side. If I go RIGHT to (7, 7), I'm also moving away but toward the right edge where I have more body presence.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI have the lead (11-10)! I don't NEED to rush apples. I need to:\n1. Stay alive\n2. Keep my options open\n3. Potentially cut off the enemy's paths\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is in the bottom-middle. I'm in the upper-middle. My body is mostly on the right side (columns 7-9).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 7):\n- I'm moving AWAY from the enemy\n- I'm closer to my own body segments on the right\n- From (7, 7), I can go DOWN to (7, 6), LEFT to (6, 7), or UP to (7, 8) - wait UP to (7, 8) is also MY body! So that's 2 options from (7, 7).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):\n- I'm moving toward the left side of the board\n- From (5, 7), I can go DOWN to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 7) - wait! (4, 7) is ENEMY BODY! That's death! Or UP to (5, 8) which is empty.\n- So from (5, 7) I'd have: DOWN to (5, 6), UP to (5, 8) - 2 safe options.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6):\n- I'm moving toward the enemy, but they're still far\n- From (6, 6), I can go LEFT to (5, 6), RIGHT to (7, 6), or DOWN to (6, 5)\n- That's 3 options! Best flexibility!\n\n**WAIT - IMPORTANT CHECK:**\nLet me look at the apples list. There's an apple at (7, 0) and (6, 1) and (1, 0) in the bottom-right area. But there's NO apple near (6, 6). I'm not moving toward an apple.\n\n**ENEMY'S POTENTIAL MOVES:**\nFrom (6, 2), enemy could move:\n- UP to (6, 3) - but that's THEIR BODY! They'd die! (Body shows (6, 3) is their segment)\n- DOWN to (6, 1) - empty, safe\n- LEFT to (5, 2) - empty, safe\n- RIGHT to (7, 2) - empty, safe\n\nSo they CAN'T move UP! They're blocked by their own body. That's huge!\n\n**REVISED ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\nThe enemy is at (6, 2) and CANNOT move UP because (6, 3) is their body. So they're stuck moving DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. They CANNOT move toward me directly!\n\nThis changes everything! If they can't move up, they're moving horizontally or down. They're NOT chasing me vertically!\n\n**MY MOVE DECISION:**\nSince the enemy can't move up toward me, I have more breathing room. I should:\n1. NOT move toward them (avoid DOWN to 6,6)\n2. Move to maintain flexibility\n3. Position for future apple collection\n\nLet me reconsider LEFT to (5, 7) and RIGHT to (7, 7):\n- LEFT to (5, 7): From there, I can go DOWN to (5, 6) or UP to (5, 8). LEFT to (4, 7) is enemy body, so that's blocked. 2 options.\n- RIGHT to (7, 7): From there, I can go DOWN to (7, 6) or LEFT to (6, 7). UP to (7, 8) is my body. 2 options.\n\nBoth have similar flexibility, but RIGHT to (7, 7) moves me away from the enemy and toward my existing body chain, which might help me control territory.\n\n**WAIT! Let me check Row 8 more carefully:**\nRow 8: \"A . . T T . 1 T T .\"\nAt (7, 8) and (8, 8), the board shows 'T' (enemy), but my body list shows them as MY segments! \n\nActually, looking at my body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), ...]\nSo (7, 8) and (8, 8) ARE my body! The 'T' on the board might be showing enemy body at (7, 8)? But that can't be...\n\nLet me trust my body list: (7, 8) and (8, 8) are MY body. So if I go to (7, 7), I can't go UP to (7, 8) next turn because that's my body.\n\n**THE KEY INSIGHT:**\nThe enemy at (6, 2) CANNOT move up to chase me because (6, 3) is their body. They're stuck in the bottom half of the board! I have room to maneuver in the upper half!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nI'll go RIGHT to (7, 7). Here's why:\n1. Moves me away from the enemy (they're at x=6, I'm going to x=7)\n2. Keeps me in the upper-right area where I have body presence\n3. From (7, 7), I have 2 safe moves: DOWN to (7, 6) or LEFT to (6, 7)\n4. I maintain the lead (11-10) and don't need to rush apples\n5. The enemy is trapped in the bottom, so I can keep circling the right side\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep the lead, stay in the upper-right quadrant, force the enemy into the bottom-left corner. When I have a significant lead (like 13-10), I can start aggressively boxing them in. For now, maintain distance and control.\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nRIGHT",

DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7, 6)**: Empty! SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (6, 7)**: That's MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 7)**: That's MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION CHAT!**\nI'm literally BOXED IN by my own body! The only safe move is DOWN to (7, 6). If I pick anything else, I die instantly. That's the game.\n\n**ENEMY'S POSITION:**\nThey're at (6, 1) now, even lower. They're still trapped in the bottom half and CAN'T move UP to chase me because (6, 2) is their body behind them. They're stuck moving DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT down there.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nI have NO choice but DOWN to (7, 6). From there:\n- I'll be at (7, 6) with a clear path\n- I can check for apples nearby - there's one at (7, 0) way below, but I'm not rushing there\n- The enemy is still far away and stuck in the bottom-left quadrant\n- My body is spread across the top-right, giving me territory control\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove DOWN to (7, 6) to escape this box, then reassess from there. The enemy is cornered in the bottom, so I should focus on maintaining my territory in the upper half and preventing them from climbing up. Once I'm clear, I can start cutting off their escape routes.\n\nNO CHOICE HERE CHAT! LET'S GO! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Suicide. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,\u202f0) is empty. \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,\u202f1) is empty. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,\u202f1) is empty. \u2705  \n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Look ahead \u2013 which safe move keeps our options open?  \n- **DOWN** puts us on the bottom edge. Next turn we\u2019d only have left or right; up would be illegal (back into our own neck).  \n- **RIGHT** forces us away from the apple\u2011rich corridor on the left and later blocks the \u201cback\u2011track\u201d move (left would be into our own body).  \n- **LEFT** lands us at (5,\u202f1). From there we can:  \n  * **LEFT** again to (4,\u202f1) \u2013 there\u2019s a juicy apple waiting! \ud83c\udf4e  \n  * **UP** to (5,\u202f2) \u2013 opens a vertical lane toward the centre.  \n  * **DOWN** to (5,\u202f0) \u2013 still inside the board.  \n\nSo **LEFT** gives us the richest set of follow\u2011up moves and a near\u2011term apple, while staying far from the opponent\u2019s inevitable path down the right side.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Opponent\u2019s immediate move  \nThey\u2019ll go **DOWN** to (7,\u202f6). No head\u2011on clash with any of our safe squares, so we\u2019re good.  \n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic note for the next few turns  \n- Grab the apple at (4,\u202f1) on the next move, then snake upward to the central column (x\u202f=\u202f4\u20115).  \n- Keep the opponent confined to the top\u2011right \u201cwall\u201d they\u2019ve built; we\u2019ll gradually snake around the bottom and cut them off when they try to loop back.  \n- Stay flexible: after the apple we\u2019ll have both left/right and up options, preventing any dead\u2011end trap.  \n\nLet\u2019s make that move and start the apple binge! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**LEFT**",

Enemy snake #0 is at (5,1) and still trapped in the bottom-left corner. Let's analyze the battlefield!\n\n**BOARD STATE VISUALIZATION (My perspective):**\n- My head: (7,6)\n- My body snakes down from there: (7,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)\n- Enemy at (5,1) with body snaking up to (4,9) - they're completely stuck in the left side\n- Apples visible: (7,0), (0,9), (3,1), (2,5), (1,0), (0,8), (2,7), (1,8), (3,0) - but remember, FOCUS ON THE ENEMY!\n\n**MOVES FROM (7,6):**\n1. **UP to (7,7)**: That's MY BODY! DEAD! \u274c\n2. **DOWN to (7,5)**: Empty! SAFE! \u2705\n3. **LEFT to (6,6)**: Empty! SAFE! \u2705\n4. **RIGHT to (8,6)**: Empty! SAFE! \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\n- DOWN to (7,5): Moves me away from my body tail and toward potential apples below. Safe option.\n- LEFT to (6,6): Moves me LEFT, deeper into the center-left area. This could potentially cut off the enemy's upward escape path if they ever break out of their corner.\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Moves me RIGHT toward my own body tail at (9,6). This could lead to trapping myself again.\n\n**THE PLAN CHAT:**\nThe enemy is STILL stuck at the bottom-left corner. If I move LEFT to (6,6), I'm positioning myself to dominate the central-left area and block any attempt by the enemy to climb up and challenge my territory. From (6,6), I'll have multiple escape routes and can maintain pressure. Moving DOWN or RIGHT might give me more immediate space but doesn't advance my territorial dominance strategy.\n\nPLUS, there's an apple at (3,1) and (2,5) in that direction - though I'm not chasing apples, they're there as backup content if needed.\n\n**LONG-TERM VISION:**\nKeep the enemy cornered in bottom-left. Control the center and top-right. Force them into a position where they have no safe moves left. Eventually, when they're desperate, we'll set up a head-on collision when we're ahead on apples.\n\nNO MERCY! LET'S BOX HIM IN!\n\nLEFT",

They have NO apples down there (check the board - all apples are elsewhere). They'll be forced to starve or crash. Meanwhile, I'm expanding my territory in the right-center.

I'm down by 5 apples, but I'm still ALIVE and I have a DECENT body length to work with. The opponent is STILL stuck in that bottom-left prison, but they're about to eat another apple and GROW. I need to start closing this gap FAST.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM HEAD (7, 5):**\n\nMy current head is at (7, 5). Let's check my options:\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** Looking at the board state... (7, 6) is marked as \"T\". That's TERRAIN? No, wait. The key says \"T\" is enemy body? Let's re-read the key. \"9 A A . . T . . . . A\" - \"A\" is apple, \".\" is empty. What is \"T\"? The opponent's body is listed as `(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6) ...`. Let me look at the board again.\n    *   Row 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\n    *   My head (7, 5) is at the \"1\".\n    *   The cells to my left: (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5) are \"T\" (Opponent body). Correct.\n    *   The cells above me: (7, 6) is \"T\" in the board state? Let's check the board map.\n    *   Row 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\n    *   Row 7: `7 . . A . T . T T T .`\n    *   Wait, the coordinates in the board state visualization might be flipped? No, it says \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right.\"\n    *   Let's look at the `YOUR SNAKE` list: `Head: (7, 5), Body: [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]`.\n    *   Okay, my body is *extensive*.\n    *   **UP (7, 6):** My body contains (7, 6). *DEAD*. I cannot eat myself.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 4):** Looking at row 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`. (7, 4) is a dot, so it's empty. *SAFE*.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 5):** My body contains (6, 5). *DEAD*.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 5):** Looking at row 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`. (8, 5) is a dot, so it's empty. *SAFE*.\n\n**THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nI am at (7, 5). I have two safe moves: DOWN to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 5).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** Moves me towards the bottom-right corner. Opens up (7, 3), (8, 4). There is an apple at (8, 0) and (7, 0) down there. But it's potentially getting lower in the grid.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Moves me toward the apple at (9, 2) and (9, 9). It also moves me to the right edge of the map, which limits my upward movement eventually (x=9 is the wall).\n\n**Analyzing Opponent Moves:**\nThe opponent (Snake #0) is at Head (1, 0). They are forced UP to (1, 1) or (1, 2) or (2, 0)? No, (2, 0) is their body. (0, 0) is off board.\n*   (1, 0) Head.\n*   Body goes to (2, 0).\n*   They are trapped in the bottom left.\n*   Possible moves: UP to (1, 1) is an apple. RIGHT to (2, 0) is their own body (crash). LEFT is off board. DOWN is off board.\n*   They **MUST** go UP to (1, 1) or die.\n*   If they go UP to (1, 1), they eat the apple there. They grow. Their head becomes (1, 1). Their tail will stay for now (unless they ate enough to shorten, but they have 16 apples, they are long).\n\n**DECISION:**\nI am at (7, 5).\nIf I go **DOWN to (7, 4)**:\n- My new head: (7, 4).\n- I open up paths to the bottom row apples.\n- The opponent is moving UP to (1, 1). We are far apart. No immediate collision risk.\n- I am \"safe\".\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 5)**:\n- My new head: (8, 5).\n- I move closer to the right wall.\n- The opponent is at (1, 1).\n- I am \"safe\".\n\nHowever, looking at the board state provided by the user:\n`5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nMy head is at (7, 5). The cell to my right is (8, 5). It is empty.\nThe cell below me is (7, 4). It is empty.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again carefully.\nRow 5: `. . A . T T T 1 . .`\nIndices 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(7, 5) is the \"1\".\n(8, 5) is the \".\" at index 8.\n(6, 5) is the \"T\" at index 6.\n(7, 4) is in row 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`. Index 7 is \".\"\n\nBoth are valid.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI need to eat apples. I am behind by 5.\nThe apples listed: (9, 2), (8, 0), (9, 9), (7, 0), (0, 9), (3, 1), (2, 5), (0, 8), (2, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 1), (1, 2), (9, 4), (2, 2).\nMost apples are in the center/left or top right.\nI am at (7, 5).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I approach (9, 2) and (9, 4) and (9, 9).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I approach (8, 0) and (7, 0).\n\nThe opponent is at (1, 0). They are moving to (1, 1). They are cornered. They are growing.\nI should probably move RIGHT to start approaching the cluster of apples on the right side. (9, 2) is very close if I keep moving right and down.\n(8, 0) is also an apple at the bottom right.\n\nLet's look at the body blocking.\nMy body: `[(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]`\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), my next moves will be constrained by the wall at x=9. But I can go DOWN to (8, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can go RIGHT to (8, 4) or LEFT to (6, 4).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 0). If I go DOWN now, I can head straight for it.\nPath: (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0).\nThat's a lot of turns.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (9, 2).\nPath: (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2).\nAlso a lot of turns.\n\nHowever, the opponent is growing. I need to be aggressive.\nThe opponent is trapped. They can't really chase me.\nI have space.\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\nThe opponent body stretches from (4, 4) up to (4, 9).\nI am at (7, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am moving away from the opponent's body block at x=4.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am moving down.\n\nActually, let's check the \"T\" in row 5. `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nThe T's are at (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5).\nWait, (6, 5) is my body? No, (6, 5) is in my body list.\n`Body: [(6, 5), ...]`\nSo (6, 5) is my body, but the map says \"T\".\nThe map legend didn't explicitly define \"T\", but in the context of the previous turn's analysis, the user referred to \"T\" as the enemy body.\nWait, looking at the board state provided by the user:\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nRow 5 indices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: A\n3: .\n4: T\n5: T\n6: T\n7: 1 (My Head)\n8: .\n9: .\n\n(6, 5) is index 6. That's a \"T\".\n(5, 5) is index 5. That's a \"T\".\n(4, 5) is index 4. That's a \"T\".\n\nBut my body list says: `Body: [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), ...]`\nSo (6, 5) and (5, 5) are definitely my body.\nWhy are they marked as \"T\"?\nMaybe \"T\" means \"Taken\" or \"Terrain/Snake Body\" generally?\nOr is it a mistake in the prompt's visualization?\nLet's trust the explicit coordinate lists provided for my snake.\nMy snake: Head (7, 5), Body includes (6, 5), (5, 5).\nSo (6, 5) and (5, 5) are occupied by my body.\nThe map shows \"T\" there.\nOkay, so \"T\" = Occupied cell (either my body or enemy body).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the moves from (7, 5).\n**UP (7, 6):**\nMy body list has (7, 6).\n`(7, 6)` is in the body list.\nSo UP is INTO MY BODY. **DEAD**.\n\n**DOWN (7, 4):**\nBoard map Row 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\nIndex 7 is `.`\nIs (7, 4) in my body? No.\nIs (7, 4) in enemy body? Enemy body is at x=4 mostly.\n(7, 4) is safe.\n\n**LEFT (6, 5):**\nBoard map Row 5 Index 6 is `T`.\nMy body list has (6, 5).\nSo LEFT is INTO MY BODY. **DEAD**.\n\n**RIGHT (8, 5):**\nBoard map Row 5 Index 8 is `.`\nIs (8, 5) in my body? No.\nIs (8, 5) in enemy body? No.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo I have two options: DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am losing 11 to 16.\nI need to catch up.\nThe opponent is moving UP to (1, 1) to eat an apple.\nI need to secure food.\nThere is an apple at (2, 5).\n(2, 5) is to my left, past the opponent's body block.\nI cannot reach (2, 5) easily because the opponent's body is at (4, 5) and (5, 5).\nWait, (5, 5) is MY body.\nEnemy body: `[(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)]`\nThe enemy is at x=4 mostly.\nMy body is at x=5, 6, 7, 8.\nI am \"boxed in\" on the left side by my own body and the enemy's body.\nI can only move DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT (8, 5):\nI move toward the apples on the right: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 9).\nAlso (8, 0) is down there.\nIf I go DOWN (7, 4):\nI move toward (8, 0) and (7, 0).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8, 0).\nIf I go DOWN now:\nTurn 36: (7, 5) -> (7, 4)\nTurn 37: (7, 4) -> (7, 3)\nTurn 38: (7, 3) -> (7, 2)\nTurn 39: (7, 2) -> (7, 1)\nTurn 40: (7, 1) -> (7, 0) [Eat Apple]\nTurn 41: (7, 0) -> (8, 0) [Eat Apple]\nThat's 5 turns to get 2 apples.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now:\nTurn 36: (7, 5) -> (8, 5)\nTurn 37: (8, 5) -> (9, 5)\nTurn 38: (9, 5) -> (9, 4) [Eat Apple]\nTurn 39: (9, 4) -> (9, 3)\nTurn 40: (9, 3) -> (9, 2) [Eat Apple]\nThat's also about 4-5 turns to get 2 apples.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (2, 5).\nTo get to (2, 5), I need to go LEFT.\nBut I am currently blocked by my own body at (6, 5) and (5, 5).\nI need to wait for my tail to move.\nMy tail is at (8, 7).\nMy body is quite long.\nThe path to the left is blocked by `[(6, 5), (5, 5), ...]`.\nIf I go DOWN now to (7, 4), I open up (7, 5) which will eventually allow me to loop back.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am moving away from the left side apples.\n\nThe opponent is at (1, 0). They are growing.\nThey are not a direct threat to me right now.\nI need to secure food.\nThere is an apple at (1, 1) which the opponent will eat.\nThere is an apple at (2, 2), (3, 1), (2, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8).\nThese are mostly on the left side.\nI am on the right side.\nI am currently separated from the left side apples by my own body and the wall.\nI need to \"unwind\" myself to get to the left side.\nGoing DOWN or RIGHT both force me to wrap around.\n\nLet's consider the immediate safety.\nMy body is blocking left and up.\nRight and down are open.\n\nIf I go RIGHT:\nI approach the right wall.\nMy body at (8, 7) and (8, 8) is near the top right.\nIf I go to (8, 5), I am below my own body (8, 7).\nNext turn I can go to (9, 5) or DOWN to (8, 4).\n(8, 4) is empty.\n(9, 5) is empty.\n\nIf I go DOWN:\nI go to (7, 4).\nNext turn I can go to (7, 3), (8, 4), or (6, 4).\n(6, 4) is currently marked as \"T\" (Enemy body?

A`\nIndex 6 is `T`.\n(6, 4) is occupied.\nSo from (7, 4), I can go DOWN to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 4).\n\nIt seems like going RIGHT gives me more options towards the \"A\" at (9, 4) and (9, 2).\nGoing DOWN leads me to the bottom edge.\n\nLet's check the apple at (7, 0).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4).\nThen (7, 3).\nThen (7, 2).\nThen (7, 1).\nThen (7, 0).\nThere is an apple at (8, 0) too.\nThis is a good path.\n\nLet's check the apple at (9, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5).\nThen (9, 5).\nThen (9, 4).\n(9, 4) is an apple.\n\nThe opponent is eating at (1, 1).\nI am safe from the opponent.\n\n**The Play:**\nI am at (7, 5).\nI will go **DOWN to (7, 4)**.\nWhy?\n1. It moves me toward the bottom edge where there are apples (8, 0) and (7, 0).\n2. It keeps me away from the wall at x=9, giving me more maneuvering room.\n3. My body is currently blocking the left and up. Going down opens up the bottom right quadrant.\n\nWait, looking at the board state again:\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\nRow 3: `3 . . . . . T T . . .`\nRow 2: `2 . A A . . . T . . A`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am at index 7 in row 4. It is empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am at index 8 in row 5. It is empty.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(8, 0) is an apple.\n(7, 0) is an apple.\n(9, 2) is an apple.\n(9, 4) is an apple.\n(9, 9) is an apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I head towards (8, 0) and (7, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I head towards (9, 2) and (9, 4).\n\nThere is also an apple at (2, 5) which is very close to my current path if I could just turn left. But (6, 5) and (5, 5) are blocking.\nMy tail is at (8, 7). My body is long. I will have to wait for my tail to move out of the way to access the left side.\nFor now, I must move DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLet's check if there are any threats.\nOpponent at (1, 0). Moving to (1, 1).\nMe at (7, 5).\nDistance is huge. No head-on collision risk.\n\nI will choose **DOWN**. Why? Because moving to the bottom row opens up the bottom-right corner. Moving to the right wall (9, 5) restricts my movement to the left (can't go to x=10).\nIf I am at (7, 4), I can go DOWN, LEFT (eventually), RIGHT, or UP (eventually).\nIf I am at (9, 5), I can only go DOWN, LEFT, or UP. I cannot go RIGHT.\nSo (7, 4) is a better central position than (9, 5).\n\nLet's double check the \"T\" in row 4.\n`4 . . . . T T . . . A`\n(4, 4) and (5, 4) are \"T\".\nThese are enemy body parts. `Enemy: ..., (4, 4), (5, 4) ...`\nSo I cannot go LEFT from (7, 4) to (6, 4).\nI can only go DOWN to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 4).\n\nWait, if I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am safe.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Focus on where the enemy is... Try to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\"\nI do NOT have a higher score (11 vs 16). I need to GROW.\nI need to eat apples.\nThe apples at (7, 0) and (8, 0) are the closest \"cluster\" that doesn't require me to hug the wall immediately.\n(9, 2) is also a cluster with (9, 4).\n\nLet's calculate moves to food:\nPath to (7, 0) via DOWN:\n(7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0).\n5 moves.\n\nPath to (9, 2) via RIGHT:\n(7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2).\n5 moves.\n\nThey are equivalent in distance.\nHowever, (9, 9) is an apple at the top right.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can eventually go UP to (9, 9) after eating (9, 2) and (9, 4).\nIf I go DOWN, I have to loop all the way back up to the top.\n\nActually, looking at my body position:\nHead (7, 5).\nBody: `[(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]`\nMy body forms a loop/wall in the center-right.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am moving into the open space below the \"loop\".\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am moving to the right of the \"loop\".\n\nIf I go DOWN:\nI can access (8, 0) and (7, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT:\nI can access (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 9).\n\nLet's check the board state for (8, 0) and (7, 0).\nRow 0: `0 . 0 T T T . . A A .`\n(7, 0) is index 7. It is empty (dot).\n(8, 0) is index 8. It is \"A\" (Apple).\nSo (8, 0) is an apple. (7, 0) is empty.\nWait, the apple list includes (8, 0) and (7, 0).\nThe board state shows (8, 0) as \"A\".\nIt shows (7, 0) as \".\".\nMaybe (7, 0) was eaten recently? Or the board state visualization is slightly off? Or (7, 0) is just empty now.\nThe apple list is authoritative.\n`(8, 0)` is in the apple list.\n`(7, 0)` is in the apple list.\nThe board state is just a snapshot.\nI should trust the apple list.\nSo (8, 0) is an apple. (7, 0) is an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I target (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 9).\n(9, 2) is in the list.\n(9, 4) is in the list.\n(9, 9) is in the list.\n\nThis is a tough choice.\nWhy not go DOWN?\nBecause if I go DOWN, I commit to the bottom right.\nIf I go RIGHT, I commit to the top right.\n\nLet's look at the opponent again.\nOpponent is at (1, 0).\nThey are moving to (1, 1).\nThey are growing.\nThey are not a threat to me in the right side.\nI have plenty of space.\n\nLet's look at my score. 11 vs 16.\nI need to catch up.\nI should go for the apples.\nAre there apples in the bottom right?\n(8, 0) and (7, 0).\nAre there apples in the top right?\n(9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 9).\n\nThe top right apples are more numerous and \"clumped\".\n(9, 2), (9, 4) are close.\n(9, 9) is far but on the same x-axis.\nThe bottom right apples are (8, 0), (7, 0). That's only 2 apples.\nIf I eat those, I have to go somewhere else.\nIf I eat the top right ones, I can potentially clear the whole column.\n\nHowever, there is a snake body blocking the way?\nMy body is at (8, 8) and (8, 7).\nIf I go to (8, 5), I am below my own body at (8, 7) and (8, 8).\nI can move up to (8, 6) (empty?), then (8, 7) is occupied by my tail (which will move).\nWait, (8, 6) is empty.\nRow 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\n(8, 6) is index 8. It is empty (dot).\nSo if I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I can go UP to (8, 6).\n(8, 6) is empty.\nThen (8, 7) is my tail. By the time I get there, it will be empty.\nSo I can climb up the right wall.\n\nLet's compare the paths again.\nPath DOWN: (7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3)...\nPath RIGHT: (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4)...\n\nThe prompt says: \"Do not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\"\nThe enemy is at (1, 0). Moving to (1, 1).\nThe enemy is trapped in the bottom left.\nI am free.\nI should use my freedom to dominate the board.\nDominating the board means taking the open space.\nThe open space is the entire right side and bottom side.\n\nIs there a reason to prefer one direction over the other?\nMy body currently blocks the area to the left (x < 7) and above (y > 5) partially.\nWait, my body is at (7, 6), (7, 7).\nSo UP is blocked.\nLEFT is blocked by (6, 5).\nSo I can only go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the \"T\" at (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can move LEFT to (6, 4)?\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\n(6, 4) is index 6. It is \"T\".\nSo (6, 4) is occupied by enemy body.\nSo I cannot go LEFT from (7, 4).\nI can only go DOWN to (7, 3) or RIGHT to (8, 4).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5):\nI can go DOWN to (8, 4).\nI can go UP to (8, 6).\nI can go RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\nIt seems like going RIGHT offers more immediate options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) while going DOWN offers (DOWN, RIGHT).\nBoth are safe.\n\nHowever, looking at the \"T\" at (5, 4) and (4, 4).\nThe opponent's body is at (4, 4) and (5, 4).\nMy head is at (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am at (7, 4).\nThe opponent is at (4, 4).\nThe distance is 3 units.\nThe opponent is growing. They are not moving towards me.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(9, 4) is an apple.\n(9, 2) is an apple.\n(8, 0) is an apple.\n(7, 0) is an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards (9, 4) and (9, 2).\nIf I go DOWN, I am moving towards (8, 0) and (7, 0).\n\nWait, look at the board state again.\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nThere is an apple at (2, 5).\nI cannot reach it right now because (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5) are blocked.\nIf I go DOWN, I might be able to loop around and get to (2, 5) eventually.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from (2, 5).\n\nThe opponent is at (1, 0). They will likely eat (1, 1) and maybe (1, 2) or (2, 2).\nThey are confined to x=0, 1, 2.\nI have x=3 to 9.\nI should utilize my space.\n\nLet's assume I go RIGHT.\nI move to (8, 5).\nFrom there, I can go to (9, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4).\n(8, 4) is empty.\n(9, 5) is empty.\n(8, 6) is empty.\n\nLet's assume I go DOWN.\nI move to (7, 4).\nFrom there, I can go to (7, 3), (8, 4).\n(7, 3) is empty.\n(8, 4) is empty.\n\nActually, look at the board state.\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\n(8, 4) is index 8. It is a dot. Empty.\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\n(8, 5) is index 8. It is a dot. Empty.\n\nThere is an apple at (9, 9).\nTo get there, I need to go UP eventually.\nIf I go DOWN now, I have to climb all the way back up.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am already closer to x=9.\n\nLet's decide based on \"growing as a means of dominating the board\".\nDominating means claiming territory.\nThe top right is empty territory.\nThe bottom right is empty territory.\nThe top right has 3 apples (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 9).\nThe bottom right has 2 apples (8, 0), (7, 0).\n\nTop right seems better.\n\nHowever, I must be careful about the wall at x=9.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5) -> (9, 5), I am at the wall.\nFrom (9, 5), I can go UP to (9, 4) [Apple!].\nOr DOWN to (9, 6) or (9, 7)?\nLet's check Row 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\n(9, 6) is index 9. It is a dot.\nRow 7: `7 . . A . T . T T T .`\n(9, 7) is index 9. It is a dot.\nRow 8: `8 A A . . T . T T T .`\n(9, 8) is index 9. It is a dot.\nRow 9: `9 A A . . T . . . . A`\n(9, 9) is index 9. It is \"A\".\n\nSo the entire column x=9 from y=0 to y=9 is largely empty except for apples.\nThis means I can safely travel up the right wall.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am heading to the bottom.\nRow 0: `0 . 0 T T T . . A A .`\n(7, 0) is empty.\n(8, 0) is apple.\n(9, 0) is empty.\nSo the bottom row is also safe.\n\nWhy choose RIGHT?\nBecause I can eat (9, 4) and (9, 2) relatively quickly, and then (9, 9).\nWhy choose DOWN?\nBecause I can eat (8, 0) and (7, 0), but then I have to turn back up.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Be aggressive.\"\nAggression usually means claiming the high-value targets.\nThe top right feels more \"dominant\" because it's the corner.\nAlso, moving RIGHT puts me closer to (9, 4) which is 2 turns away (Right, Up).\nMoving DOWN puts me closer to (8, 0) which is 5 turns away.\n\nWait, let's re-read the prompt's last move rationale.\n\"RIGHT to (7,5) is the WINNING move! It... Opens up paths to multiple apples!\"\nThe user previously chose RIGHT to get to (7, 5).\nNow I am at (7, 5).\nI should continue the momentum.\n\nLet's check the board state one more time.\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\nMy head is at index 7.\nIndex 8 is empty.\nIndex 9 is empty.\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\n(8, 4) is empty.\n(9, 4) is apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I am safe.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I am safe.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go RIGHT?\nMy body is at (8, 8) and (8, 7).\nIf I go to (8, 5), I am getting closer to my body at (8, 7).\nBut (8, 6) is empty. I can slot in there.\nMy tail is at (8, 7). It will move eventually.\nSo (8, 7) will be empty.\nSo I can snake up the right side.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go DOWN?\nIf I go to (7, 4), I am moving towards the bottom.\nThere are no obstacles.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(2, 5) is an apple.\n(1, 8), (1, 9) are apples.\nThese are on the left.\nTo get them, I need to go around my own body or the opponent.\nThe opponent is at x=0-4.\nI am at x=7.\nI can move towards x=0 by going DOWN (to y=0) then LEFT (to x=0) then UP?\nBut the opponent is there.\nThe opponent is at (1, 0) -> (1, 1).\nThey are growing.\nIf I go to the bottom row (y=0), I will be near the opponent.\nIf I go to the right wall (x=9), I am far away from the opponent.\n\nSafety: Being far from the opponent is safe.\nGrowth: Eating apples is growth.\n\nOkay, let's look at the apple at (9, 4).\nIt's right there above the empty space at (9, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 5), I can go UP to (8, 6) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 9)? No, that's inefficient.\nFrom (8, 5):\nGo RIGHT to (9, 5).\nGo UP to (9, 4). (Apple)\nGo UP to (9, 3).\nGo UP to (9, 2). (Apple)\nThis is a very efficient path.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nGo DOWN to (7, 3)...\nGo DOWN to (7, 0).\nGo RIGHT to (8, 0). (Apple)\nThis is also a path, but the apples are slightly further apart vertically.\n\nDecision:\nI will go **RIGHT**.\nThis allows me to access the top-right apples efficiently.\nIt keeps me away from the opponent's growing territory in the bottom-left.\nIt utilizes the empty space on the right side of the board.\n\nFinal check:\nHead (7, 5).\nMove RIGHT to (8, 5).\nIs (8, 5) safe?\nRow 5: `. . A . T T T 1 . .`\nIndex 8 is `.` (Empty).\nIs (8, 5) on my body? No.\nIs (8, 5) on enemy body? No (Enemy is at x=4).\nIs (8, 5) off board? No (x=8 is valid).\nIs it backwards? No (I was at x=7).\n\nSeems correct.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nFrom (8, 5), I will likely move RIGHT to (9, 5) to get closer to (9, 4) and (9, 2).\nOr UP to (8, 6) to clear space for my tail.\nBut for now, RIGHT is the move.\n\nThe prompt asks for a \"short long-term plan or strategy note\".\nI will write that in the text.\n\n\"LET'S REVIEW THE CLIP\" section:\nMy last move was RIGHT (to get to 7, 5).\nThat was correct.\n\nCurrent move:\nI am at (7, 5).\nOptions: DOWN or RIGHT.\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nOne detail: The opponent is at (1, 0).\nThey are forced to move UP to (1, 1) to eat an apple.\nThey will grow.\nI must grow faster.\n\nLet's write the response.\n\nYO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 36 is LIVE! \ud83d\ude24\nScore: 11 vs 16. I'm trailing, but I'm not out.\nI'm at (7, 5).\nMy body blocks LEFT and UP.\nDOWN (7, 4) and RIGHT (8, 5) are safe.\nI'm choosing RIGHT.\nWhy? Because I see a path to the top-right apples (9, 4) and (9, 2).\nThe opponent is stuck in the bottom-left. I'm taking the top-right.\nLet's get this bread. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nI will make sure the last word is just \"RIGHT\".YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! Turn 36 is LIVE! \ud83d\udd25 We're in the endgame now, but we're NOT done! Scoreboard: ME 11 apples vs. OPPONENT 16 apples. I'm down by 5, but I'm still ALIVE and I have a DECENT body length to work with. The opponent is STUCK in that bottom-left prison, but they're about to eat another apple and GROW. I need to start closing this gap FAST.\n\n**BOARD ANALYSIS FROM HEAD (7, 5):**\n\nMy current head is at (7, 5). Let's check my options:\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** That's MY BODY! (7, 6) is in my body list. I would crash into myself. DEAD! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** Looking at the board state... Row 4, index 7 is a dot (empty). My body isn't there. Enemy body is at x=4. This is SAFE! \u2705\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** That's MY BODY! (6, 5) is in my body list. I would crash into myself. DEAD! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Looking at the board state... Row 5, index 8 is a dot (empty). My body isn't there. Enemy body is at x=4. This is SAFE! \u2705\n\n**THE STRATEGIC PLAY:**\n\nI have two safe moves: DOWN to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 5).\n\n**ANALYZING THE OPPONENT:**\nThe opponent is at (1, 0). They are TRAPPED. They are forced to move UP to (1, 1) (which is an apple) or die. They will grow, but they are stuck in the corner. They are NOT a threat to me right now. I have the whole board to myself!\n\n**CHOOSING THE MOVE:**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** Moves me toward the bottom-right corner. There are apples at (8, 0) and (7, 0) down there. Good, but I'd be hugging the edge.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Moves me toward the top-right corner. There is a CLUSTER of apples there: (9, 2), (9, 4), and (9, 9). This is HIGH VALUE territory.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **RIGHT to (8, 5)**!\nWhy?\n\u2705 **Safety First:** It's safe. No walls, no body collisions.\n\u2705 **Aggression:** I need to eat to catch up. The top-right corner has multiple apples waiting for me. I'm claiming that territory NOW.\n\u2705 **Space:** Moving right keeps me away from the opponent's expanding territory in the bottom-left. I want to dominate the board, not play corner tag.\n\nI'm not just surviving; I'm hunting. The opponent is growing in their prison, but I'm building an empire on the right side. When I have the lead, THEN I'll box them in!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSecure the top-right apples (9, 4) and (9, 2). Maintain distance from the opponent. Use the right wall as a boundary to funnel my movement.\n\nRIGHT",

No head\u2011on risk.  \n\n**\ud83c\udf4e Why UP wins:**  \n\n1. **Apple lock\u2011on** \u2013 (1,\u202f2) holds a fresh apple. Grabbing it bumps us to **18 apples** and lengthens us right where we have free room to maneuver.  \n2. **Future freedom** \u2013 after the move we\u2019ll sit at (1,\u202f2) with three safe options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). The vertical wall at **x\u202f=\u202f4** stays intact, still hemming the rival on the right side.  \n3. **Long\u2011term pressure** \u2013 climbing the left side lets us later sweep the high\u2011value stack at (0,\u202f8) & (0,\u202f9) while the opponent is trapped behind the wall.  \n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Quick plan for the next few turns:**  \n- Keep climbing the left column, snatching apples at (2,\u202f2), (3,\u202f1), then swing up the far\u2011left wall to seize (0,\u202f8) & (0,\u202f9).  \n- Preserve a wide corridor left of the wall so the foe can\u2019t cut us off.  \n- When we\u2019re ahead in score (we already are), look for a **head\u2011on** opportunity once the rival is forced toward the wall.  \n\n**\ud83d\udca5 Bottom line:** Grab the apple, stay alive, and keep the pressure on the right\u2011side rival.  \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO WHAT IS GOOD CHAT! We are LIVE at Turn 37! \ud83d\udd25 Let's look at the board!\n\nMy head is at **(8, 5)**. I am size 11.\nOpponent is at **(1, 1)** with 17 apples (grower!).\n\n**BOARD CHECK FROM (8, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** Row 6 shows index 8 is `.` (empty). My body is at (7, 6), (8, 8), etc. (8, 6) is safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** Row 4 shows index 8 is `.` (empty). Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** This is my current head position. The cell *behind* my head (where I just came from) is (7, 5). Moving back into my own body is a CRASH. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Row 5 shows index 9 is `.` (empty). Safe.\n\n**THE STRATEGY:**\nI have two directions: UP or RIGHT (or DOWN).\n*   **UP (8, 6):** This moves me toward the top-right apples (9, 9) and (9, 4). It keeps me central.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 5):** This hugs the wall.\n*   **DOWN (8, 4):** This moves toward (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n\nI need to eat apples to catch up. The opponent is safe in the corner, so I need to dominate the board.\nIf I go **UP**, I open up the path to (9, 9) and (9, 4). (9, 4) is currently empty based on the board state provided, but (9, 2) is an apple.\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 5: `5 . . A . T T T 1 . .` (Wait, my head is at (8,5), so row 5 index 8 is .)\nRow 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .` (Wait, my body is at (8,6)? No, my body is `[(7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]`).\nWait, my body list has (7, 6) and (8, 8).\nSo (8, 6) is NOT in my body.\n(9, 5) is NOT in my body.\n\nHowever, looking at the *board map*:\nRow 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\nRow 6 indices: 0-3 are `.`. 4-7 are `T` (Enemy body).\nIndex 8 is `.`.\nIndex 9 is `.`.\nSo (8, 6) is safe. (9, 6) is safe.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApples: (9, 2), (8, 0), (9, 9), (7, 0), (0, 9), (3, 1), (2, 5), (0, 8), (2, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 2), (9, 4), (2, 2), (4, 2).\n\nI am at (8, 5).\nIf I go **UP to (8, 6)**:\n- I am closer to (9, 9) and (9, 4).\n- I am moving away from (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n- (8, 6) is safe.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (9, 5)**:\n- I hit the wall. Future options are limited (only UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n- (9, 5) is not an apple.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (8, 4)**:\n- I am closer to (9, 2) and (8, 0).\n- (8, 4) is safe.\n\nThe opponent is moving. They are at (1, 1). They will likely try to reach (2, 2) or (3, 1).\nI need to keep my options open.\nGoing **UP** seems safer for map control. If I go RIGHT to (9, 5), I trap myself against the wall.\nGoing UP keeps me in the \"danger zone\" between the enemy body (at x=4) and the wall.\n\nLet's reconsider the map.\nRow 6: `6 . . . . T T T T . .`\nThe \"T\"s are at indices 4, 5, 6, 7.\nMy head is at (8, 5). If I go UP to (8, 6), I am at row 6, index 8.\nThat is `.`. Safe.\nIf I go UP to (8, 6), my next move can be UP to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 6) or DOWN (back) or LEFT (7, 6).\n(7, 6) is my body.\n(8, 7) is currently empty (Row 7 index 8 is `.`).\n(9, 6) is currently empty (Row 6 index 9 is `.`).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4):\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\nIndex 8 is `.`. Safe.\nNext moves: (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 4), (7, 4).\n(9, 4) is an apple! (According to the list: (9, 4)).\n\nWait, the list says (9, 4) is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4), I can go RIGHT to (9, 4) to eat an apple on the next turn.\nThat is a strong play. Eating closes the gap (11 vs 17).\n\nLet's trace the path for DOWN.\nTurn 37: Move DOWN to (8, 4).\nTurn 38: Move RIGHT to (9, 4) -> EAT APPLE. Score 12.\nTurn 39: I'm at (9, 4). I am on the right wall.\nOptions: UP to (9, 5), DOWN to (9, 3), LEFT to (8, 4).\n(9, 5) is empty.\n(9, 3) is empty.\n(8, 4) is my previous body (assuming it hasn't moved, but it will have).\n\nLet's check the board state for (9, 4).\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\nIndex 9 is `A`. Yes, (9, 4) is an apple.\nSo moving DOWN sets me up to eat (9, 4) next turn.\n\nIs there an apple at (8, 6)? No.\nIs there an apple at (9, 5)? No.\nIs there an apple at (8, 4)? No.\n\nSo, **DOWN** is the move that leads to an apple next turn.\n**UP** leads to... (8, 7). Is there an apple at (8, 7)? No. (9, 9) is far.\n**RIGHT** leads to (9, 5). No apple.\n\nThe opponent is at (1, 1). They are not chasing me. I have time to eat.\n\nLet's verify safety of (8, 4).\nMy body is at: (8, 5) [current head], (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8).\n(8, 4) is NOT in this list.\nEnemy body: x=4 mostly. (8, 4) is safe.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 4).\n2. Next turn, move RIGHT to (9, 4) to eat the apple.\n3. This gains me +1 point, bringing me to 12 apples. Still behind, but closer.\n\nWait, let's double check the \"Moving directly BACKWARDS\" rule.\nMy head is at (8, 5). My body includes (7, 5).\nMoving LEFT would be back to (7, 5). That is illegal.\nMoving DOWN is to (8, 4). That is not backwards.\nMoving UP is to (8, 6). Not backwards.\nMoving RIGHT is to (9, 5). Not backwards.\n\nSo DOWN, UP, and RIGHT are mechanically safe.\nDOWN is strategically best because it secures an apple immediately next turn.\nUP is ambiguous.\nRIGHT hugs the wall, which is usually bad, but here it leads to (9, 6) which is empty.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\n`5 . . A . T T T 1 . .`\n`6 . . . . T T T T . .`\n`4 . . . . T T . . . A`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4):\n- I am at `Row 4, Index 8`.\n- Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (9, 4) [Apple].\n- I can also go DOWN to (8, 3).\n- (8, 3) is `.`.\n\nIf I go UP to (8, 6):\n- I am at `Row 6, Index 8`.\n- Next turn, I can go UP to (8, 7) [`.`, safe].\n- Or RIGHT to (9, 6) [`.`, safe].\n\nThe apple at (9, 4) is closer than any other apple right now.\nDistance to (9, 4) from (8, 5): 1 step DOWN + 1 step RIGHT = 2 turns.\nDistance to (9, 2) from (8, 5): 1 step DOWN + 2 steps LEFT (wait, no) + 1 step DOWN? No.\n(9, 2) is at (9, 2).\nPath: (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (9, 2). 4 turns.\nOr (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2). 4 turns.\n\nThe apple at (8, 0) is even further.\n\nSo the immediate apple is (9, 4).\nI must go DOWN.\n\nWait, let's check the opponent's potential moves.\nOpponent at (1, 1). Body at (1, 0), (2, 0)... (4, 9).\nOpponent can move UP to (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (2, 1).\n(1, 2) is an apple.\n(2, 2) is an apple.\n(3, 1) is an apple.\nThey are growing. I need to eat.\n\nMy move: DOWN.\n\nLet's check if (8, 4) is a trap.\n(8, 4) leads to (9, 4) [Apple], (8, 3) [Open], (7, 4) [Open], (8, 5) [Body - but will be gone if I move].\nIt's not a trap.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN. Eat the apple next turn.\n\nWait, one check on (8, 4).\nIs (8, 4) marked as \"T\" or \"A\"?\nRow 4: `4 . . . . T T . . . A`\nIndex 8 is `.`.\nSo it's empty.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go down?\nIf I go UP, I stay at x=8. If I go RIGHT, I hit the wall.\nIf I go DOWN, I get closer to the bottom right apples and the (9, 4) apple.\n\nLet's confirm the body movement.\nHead (8, 5) -> (8, 4).\nNew body: (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), ...\n(8, 5) is now body.\n(7, 5) is now body.\n(6, 5) is now body.\n...\n(8, 8) is tail. It moves to (8, 7) (or wherever the second to last is).\nThe tail movement doesn't affect my immediate safety check.\n\nDecision is solid.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Let's analyze the battlefield. \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Current Head:** (9, 4)\n**Enemy Head:** (2, 2) - He's way over on the left side. Not an immediate threat unless he makes a huge lunge across the board.\n**Score:** Me 12 vs Enemy 19. I am trailing by 7 apples. I need to play aggressive and farm efficiently.\n\n**Board Scan:**\n- **UP to (9, 5):** Row 5, Col 9. In the grid, this is the rightmost cell of Row 5. The grid shows Row 5: `. . A . T T T T T .` -> Index 9 is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN to (9, 3):** Row 3, Col 9. In the grid, Row 3: `. . . . . T T . A .` -> Index 9 is `.` (empty). **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT to (8, 4):** Row 4, Col 8. In the grid, Row 4: `. . . . T T . . T 1` -> Index 8 is `T` (Tail). This is part of the enemy snake body (Snake #0's tail is at (4,9), and his body snakes down. Checking the enemy body list: `[(1, 2), ... (4, 9)]`. Let's trace the body near (8,4). The grid shows `T` there. If I move LEFT, I hit the enemy body. **DEAD**. \u274c\n- **RIGHT to (10, 4):** Off the board (x=10 is invalid). **DEAD**. \u274c\n\n**Analysis:**\nI am pinned against the right wall. My only safe moves are UP or DOWN. Moving LEFT is fatal because the enemy snake's body extends all the way to column 8 at row 4.\nThe enemy is currently far away, so I don't need to worry about a head-on collision immediately.\nI need to avoid trapping myself. My body is currently snaking down from (9,4) -> (8,4) -> (8,5)...\nIf I go DOWN to (9,3), my next moves are likely (9,2) (which has an apple) or (8,3) (empty).\nIf I go UP to (9,5), the area looks open upwards.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe enemy is on the left. I am on the right. I need to consolidate space on the right. I see an apple at (9,2) and (9,9).\nLet's look at (9,5). Moving UP keeps me on the right wall. It opens up access to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9).\nMoving DOWN to (9,3) opens up (9,2).\nBoth are valid. However, looking at the board state, the top right corner (9,9) has an apple. The bottom right (9,2) has an apple.\nMy body is currently occupying (8,4), (8,5), (7,5)...\nIf I go UP, I go to (9,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (9,3).\nNeither direction leads immediately into my own body.\nHowever, I need to watch out for the enemy. He is currently at (2,2). He might move UP or RIGHT.\nIf he moves UP, he eats (2,3).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he eats (2,3) or hits his own body? His body is at (1,2). Right of (2,2) is (3,2) which is empty (grid row 2: `. T 0 . A . T . . A`). So he can move right.\nI am safe for this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have 12 apples, he has 19. I need to eat apples fast. I can see apples at (9,2) and (9,9).\n(9,2) is 2 squares down. (9,9) is 4 squares up.\nThe path down (9,3), (9,2) looks clear.\nThe path up (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9) also looks clear based on the grid (Row 5: `. . A . T T T T T .` - Wait, Row 5 col 8 is T? Let's check the board again).\nRow 5: `. . A . T T T T T .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nCol 8 is 'T'. That is (8,5).\nMy current head is (9,4).\nIf I go UP to (9,5), I am at Col 9, Row 5. The grid shows Row 9 (Index 9) is `.`.\nSo (9,5) is empty.\nIf I go UP again to (9,6), Row 6: `. . . . T T T T . .`. Index 9 is `.`.\n(9,7): Row 7: `A . A . T . T T . .`. Index 9 is `.`.\n(9,8): Row 8: `A A . . T . T T . .`. Index 9 is `.`.\n(9,9): Row 9: `A A . . T A . . . A`. Index 9 is `A` (Apple).\nSo the path UP is clear.\n\nPath DOWN:\n(9,3): Row 3: `. . . . . T T . A .`. Index 9 is `.`.\n(9,2): Row 2: `. T 0 . A . T . . A`. Index 9 is `A` (Apple).\n(9,1): Row 1: `. T . A T T T . . .`. Index 9 is `.`.\n(9,0): Row 0: `. T T T T . . A A .`. Index 9 is `.`.\nPath DOWN is also clear.\n\nWhich direction gives me more options?\nGoing UP takes me toward the top right corner. The corner is often a safe zone to loop or survive.\nGoing DOWN takes me toward the bottom right. The bottom right is also relatively open.\nHowever, the enemy is low on the board (Y=2). If I go DOWN, I get closer to the enemy vertically (Y=2 vs Y=4). If I go UP, I move further away.\nAlso, if I go UP, I am moving towards (9,9). If I go DOWN, I am moving towards (9,2).\nLet's look at the density of apples. (9,2) is an apple. (9,9) is an apple.\nThere is also an apple at (8,0), (7,0), (9,9), (0,9), etc.\nI need to maximize my survival and scoring.\nIf I go DOWN, I am heading towards the enemy's territory (he is at Y=2). If he moves UP, we might collide.\nIf I go UP, I am heading to the top right corner, away from him.\nStaying away from the enemy is generally safer.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (9,5). This keeps me on the right wall, moves me away from the enemy (who is at Y=2), and keeps the path to the apple at (9,9) open. It also keeps the path to (9,2) open if I decide to turn around later (though turning around in a 1-wide corridor is risky). Let's secure the top right corner.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

One wrong move and it's GG.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:**\nMy Head: (9, 5)\nEnemy Head: (3, 2)\n\nLet's look at the board and the \"Grid View\" provided in the last prompt.\nRow 5: `. . A . T T T T T .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy Head is at (9, 5).

The `T`s before it are my body or enemy body?\nThe ASCII art shows `T T T T T 1` at the end of Row 5.\nLet's check my body list: `[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)]`\nMy head is (9, 5).\n(9, 4) is my neck.\n(8, 4) is part of my body.\n(8, 5) is part of my body.\n(7, 5) is part of my body.\n(6, 5) is part of my body.\n(5, 5) is part of my body.\n\nThe ASCII art shows `T T T T T` in columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 at row 5.\nLet's map it:\nCol 4 (9, 4): My Body\nCol 5 (8, 4): My Body? No, (8, 4) is X=8, Y=4. This is Row 4.\nRow 5 is Y=5.\nMy body at Y=5: (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5).\nSo at Row 5, Cols 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 should be my body.\nASCII: `5 . . A .

That is Row 4, Col 9.\nRow 4 ASCII: `. . . . T T . . T T`\nIndices:\n8: `T`\n9: `T`\nSo (9,4) is a T (my body).\nWhat about (8,4)? Row 4, Col 8 is `T`. My body.\nWhat about (8,5)? Row 5, Col 8 is `T`. My body.\n\nOkay, I am surrounded by my own body on the right side.\n\n**ANALYZING MOVES:**\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Row 6 ASCII: `. . . .

It's my own body.\n    *   **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):**\n    *   **Board Check:** Off the grid (x=10).\n    *   **DEAD.** \u274c\n\n**WAIT.** The prompt says \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL\".\nMy head is (9,5).\nMy body is `[(9, 4), (8, 4), ...]`\nSo (9,4) is connected to (9,5). (9,4) is the segment *behind* my head.\nIf I move DOWN to (9,4), I am moving into the cell my head just left? No, wait.\nMy head is at (9,5).\nMy neck is at (9,4).\nMoving DOWN from (9,5) goes to (9,4).\nIf I move into my neck, do I die?\nRule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\nYes, moving into (9,4) is moving into the cell immediately behind my head. That is **DEADLY**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **UP**.\n\n**STRATEGY CHECK:**\nThe prompt asks me to be aggressive and force head-on collisions if I have a higher score.\nScore: Me 12 vs Enemy 19. I am losing. I should NOT force head-on collisions yet.\nI need to survive and eat apples.\n\nWhere are the apples?\nApple drops include (9, 9), (8, 0), (9, 2), (7, 0), (0, 9), (3, 1), (2, 5), (0, 8), (2, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (4, 2), (8, 3), (0, 7), (5, 9).\n\nI am at (9, 5).\nApple at (9, 9) is 4 steps UP.\nApple at (9, 2) is 3 steps DOWN. But DOWN is blocked by my body (9,4).\nWait, can I go DOWN later?\nMy body is `[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), ...]`\nIf I go UP to (9,6), my tail (6,8) will move forward.\nNext turn, (9,4) might move to (9,5) (if I don't eat), or (9,4) might stay (if I eat and grow).\nIf I eat an apple at (9,6), I grow. The tail stays at (6,8).\nThen (9,4) remains part of my body.\nSo if I go UP to (9,6), then (9,5) becomes the neck, (9,4) remains body.\nNext move DOWN to (9,5) would be into my neck. Still dead.\nNext move LEFT to (8,6) would be into (8,6). Let's check (8,6).\nRow 6: `. . . . T T T T . .`\nIndex 8 is `T`. That is my body (8,6).\nSo LEFT is blocked.\nWhat about (9,7)?\nRow 7: `A . A . T . T T . .`\nIndex 9 is `.`. (9,7) is empty.\nSo I can go UP to (9,6), then UP to (9,7).\n\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards the top right corner.\nThe enemy is at (3, 2). He is bottom left.\nDistance: 6 vertical, 6 horizontal. He is far.\nIf I go UP, I am safe from him for a few turns.\nIf I go UP, I get closer to the apple at (9,9).\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from the apple at (9,2). But since (9,2) is blocked by my body (9,4), I can't get there anyway unless my tail moves.\nActually, can I reach (9,2)?\nTo reach (9,2), I need to clear (9,4) and (9,3).\nMy tail is currently at (6,8).\nIf I keep moving UP, my body will stretch up the right wall.\n(9,5) -> (9,6) -> (9,7)...\nMy body below will be (9,4), (8,4), (8,5)...\nIf I want to go DOWN later, I need (9,4) to become free (tail moves away).\nFor (9,4) to become free, I need to move forward 3 steps (length of my body loop).\nIf I go UP 3 times: (9,6), (9,7), (9,8).\nThen my tail might have moved enough to free up (9,4)?\nWait, my body is not a straight line.\nCurrent Body: `[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8)]`\nThe \"free space\" calculation is complex.\nHowever, I am currently pinned against the wall with only one exit: UP.\nIf I don't go UP, I die (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT are invalid).\nSo I must go UP.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\nMoving UP to (9, 6).\nIs it occupied?\nRow 6, Col 9 is empty (`.`).\nIs it an apple?\nRow 6, Col 9 is empty.\nIs the enemy moving there?\nEnemy is at (3, 2). He can move UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2), RIGHT (4,2).\nApple at (3, 1) is below him. Apple at (2, 5) is above left.\nHe is unlikely to jump 6 squares to the right in one turn.\nSo (9, 6) is safe.\n\n**PLAN:**\nMove UP. Secure the top right corridor. Wait for the enemy to engage or make a mistake. I need to find an apple. (9,9) is the target.\n\n**FINAL CHECK:**\nMove: UP.\nTarget: (9, 6).\nStatus: Safe.\nScore: 12 vs 19. I need to play it safe to catch up. Rushing now is suicide.\nLet's go.\n\nUP",

Moving there would trap us on the next turn.  \n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Opponent outlook**  \n- Opponent head at (9,\u202f6) can only go **UP** to (9,\u202f7) or **LEFT** to (8,\u202f6). No chance of an immediate head\u2011on with us.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Tactical Goal**  \nTake the safe upward step, keep the vertical \u201cspine\u201d open, and expose a leftward exit at (3,\u202f3). This preserves at least one legal move for the next turn while staying far from the opponent\u2019s right\u2011side pack.\n\n**\u2705 Safety Check**  \n- No self\u2011collision, no wall hit.  \n- Opponent cannot reach (4,\u202f3) this turn.  \n- Future space: after UP we can go LEFT to (3,\u202f3) and then swing around the left side of the board to hunt high\u2011value apples.\n\n**\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Short\u2011term plan**  \n1. **Turn\u202f41** \u2013 **UP** to (4,\u202f3).  \n2. Next turn \u2013 **LEFT** to (3,\u202f3) (still empty).  \n3. Continue carving a path along the top\u2011left quadrant, forcing the opponent into the cramped right\u2011wall.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum and stay alive!  \n\n**UP**",

Let's break down the board.\n\n**Score Check:** Me: 12 \ud83c\udf4e vs Enemy: 20 \ud83c\udf4e. I'm down by 8. I need to close this gap, but I can't get reckless. The enemy is huge (20 segments long!) and camping the center. If he traps me, it's game over.\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\n*   **My Position:** Head at (9, 6). Just moved UP from (9, 5).\n*   **My Body:** My tail is currently at (6, 8).\n*   **The Trap:** I'm hugging the right wall. Looking at the ASCII:\n    *   Row 6 (my row): `. . . . T T T T . 1` (Col 9 is my head).\n    *   Row 5 (below me): `. . A . T T T T T T`. Col 9 is a `T` (my body from previous position).\n    *   Row 7 (above me): `A . A . T . T T . .`. Col 9 is `.` (Empty!).\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (9, 7) is empty (shown as `.` in Row 7).\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (4, 2). He is far away in the bottom-left. He cannot reach me this turn.\n    *   **Future:** This opens up the top-right corner. I can eventually turn LEFT or continue UP towards the apple at (9, 9).\n    *   **RISK:** If I keep going UP, I am walking into a narrow corridor between my own body and the wall. BUT, since my tail is moving up (it will eventually slide into (6,7) or similar), the space behind me might open up for a turnaround later. However, my immediate forward path is open.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 6, Col 8 is `T`. That is my body (specifically, the segment (8,6)). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **Verdict:** \u274c CRASH.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (9, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Row 5, Col 9 is `T`. That is my body (the tail segment I just vacated?). Wait, looking at my body list: `[(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), ...]`. My head is (9,6). The cell (9,5) is my neck.\n    *   **Rule:** Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head) is **DEADLY**.\n    *   **Verdict:** \u274c CRASH.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Off the board. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **Verdict:** \u274c CRASH.\n\n**The Verdict:**\nThe math is brutal. I am pinned against the wall.\n*   Left is blocked by my body.\n*   Down is blocked by my neck (backwards move).\n*   Right is the void.\n\n**I have no choice. I must go UP.** \ud83d\udc80\n\nEven though I'm walking into a tight squeeze, I have to keep moving forward to survive. My tail will eventually clear the space below me, giving me room to maneuver later. But for now, UP is the only path to victory.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nSurvive the squeeze. I need to spot an opening to turn LEFT into the center column (Col 8 or 7) before I hit the wall at (9,9). The enemy is distracted in the bottom-left, so I have a small window to secure the top-right apple at (9,9).\n\nLET'S GOOOO!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! WE ARE LITERALLY IN THE ENDGAME NOW! Turn 42, 108 turns left. The score is brutal: 12 vs 20. I'm down by 8 apples and the enemy is a massive WALL of 21 segments camping the center. If I want to win this, I need to start cutting him off immediately.\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. Current Board Check:**\n*   **My Head:** (9, 7)\n*   **My Body:** [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)]\n*   **Enemy Head:** (4, 3) - surrounded by his own body segments everywhere except North (4,4) and West (3,3).\n*   **Available Moves from (9, 7):**\n\n    *   **UP to (9, 8):**\n        *   **Board State Check:** Row 8, Col 9 is `.` (Empty).\n        *   **Safety:** Safe from wall. Safe from enemy body (enemy is far left). Safe from my body (I am below/behind).\n        *   **Strategy:** This moves me up towards the apple at (9, 9) and opens up the top right corner. It also keeps my vertical column open so I can turn LEFT later if I need to cut the enemy off. This is the **dominance play**. I need to claim the right side and push left.\n\n    *   **LEFT to (8, 7):**\n        *   **Board State Check:** Row 7, Col 8 is `T` (Enemy body).\n        *   **Safety:** **DEADLY.** If I move here, I crash into the enemy's body. I lose the run instantly.\n\n    *   **DOWN to (9, 6):**\n        *   **Safety:** This is my neck. Moving backwards into my own body is **DEADLY**. Also, the board shows Row 6, Col 9 is `T`.\n\n    *   **RIGHT to (10, 7):**\n        *   **Safety:** Off the board. **DEADLY.**\n\n**2. The Verdict:**\nChat, the math is cruel but simple. I am pinned. However, unlike last turn, there is an opening UP. (9, 8) is empty.\n\nMy body is currently snaking around the right side. If I go UP to (9, 8), I am one step closer to (9, 9) (which has an apple!) and I am securing the entire right edge of the board. The enemy is trapped in the bottom-left; he cannot reach me. I need to stop playing scared and start claiming territory.\n\n**3. Long-Term Strategy:**\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Secure (9, 9) next turn.\n*   **Mid-Term Goal:** Once I reach the top wall or eat the apple, I need to turn LEFT (West). My goal is to build a \"wall\" across the top of the board (or at least row 8/9) to cut the enemy off from the top-right quadrant.\n*   **Win Condition:** I am 8 apples behind. I need to eat 9 apples to win (since we likely tie at 21 if I just catch up, but I need the lead). I need to find apples on the right side (see (8, 3) and (8, 0) are available long-term) and hope the enemy starves or hits me.\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI am taking the only open lane.

Let's analyze the board state for this turn.**\n\n**CURRENT STATUS:**\n- **My Head:** (9, 9)\n- **My Body:** [(9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (9, 9)] *(Wait, the board state shows the apple at (9,9) was eaten, so my body should now include the previous head at (9,9) and the tail moves from (7,6)?)*\n- **Enemy Head:** (3, 4)\n- **Enemy Body:** [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]\n\n**BOARD STATE CHECK (Row 9):**\nRow 9 is currently: `. . . . . . . . . . 1` (My head is at (9,9)).\nWait, looking at the provided board state in the prompt for Turn 44, it shows:\n`9 A A . . . A . . . 1`\nBut I just ate the apple at (9,9). The prompt says \"Turn: 44 / 150\". The \"Apple Drops\" list still includes (9,9). The board state provided in the prompt likely reflects the state *before* my move or *at the start of this turn*? No, the prompt says \"Turn: 44\" and lists the board. The previous turn was 43. The prompt says \"Turn 44 / 150\" and provides the board.\nActually, the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 44 is:\n```\n9 A A . . . A . . . 1\n```\nThis implies there are still apples at (9,0) and (9,1)? No, that's column 9. The text `1` at the end represents my head at (9,9).\nWait, the prompt says \"APPLE DROPS: (9, 2), (8, 0)...\" and lists (9,2). The board state at (9,2) shows `A`.\nRow 9: `(9,0)=A`, `(9,1)=A`, `(9,2)=A`? No, the board text is `9 A A . . . A . . . 1`.\nIndices: 0:A, 1:A, 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:A, 7:., 8:., 9:1.\nSo (9,0) is A, (9,1) is A, (9,6) is A? No, (9,6) is the 7th character? Let's count.\n`9 A A . . . A . . . 1`\nCol 0: A\nCol 1: A\nCol 2: .\nCol 3: .\nCol 4: .\nCol 5: .\nCol 6: A\nCol 7: .\nCol 8: .\nCol 9: 1 (My head)\nSo there is an apple at (9,0), (9,1), and (9,6).\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n**1. Analyze Moves from Head (9,9):**\n- **UP:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n- **DOWN:** To (9, 8). This is currently my body (the old head from turn 43 was at (9,8), and the body follows).\n  - *Safety Check:* Moving into my own body is a crash. **DEAD.**\n- **LEFT:** To (8, 9).\n  - *Safety Check:* (8,9) is currently empty on the board (`.`). Is it occupied by my own body?\n    - My body: (9,8), (9,7)... No, (8,9) is not in the list.\n    - Is it occupied by the enemy? Enemy is at x=3/4. No.\n  - *Result:* **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT:** Off board. **DEAD.**\n\n**2. Strategic Analysis:**\nThe only legal move is **LEFT**.\nWhy is this good?\n- **Survival:** Mandatory.\n- **Positioning:** I am sweeping the top edge. Moving to (8,9) keeps me safe.\n- **Apple Access:** There is an apple at (9,6). From (8,9), I can eventually path towards (9,6) or (8,0) (if I go down the left side).\n- **Enemy Trapping:** The enemy is still in the bottom-left corner (x=3/4). They are slowly moving out, but they are far away. I control the top right.\n\n**3. Long-Term Plan:**\n- **Immediate:** Move LEFT to (8,9).\n- **Next Turn:** From (8,9), I can move DOWN or LEFT. I need to look for apples. There is an apple at (9,6). To get there, I need to go DOWN to (8,8), (8,7) etc. But wait, there is an apple at (9,6) and (9,1) on the top row. I should probably sweep the top row first or descend carefully.\n- **Goal:** Reach 30 apples. I have 14. Enemy has 20. I need to eat fast.\n- **Aggression:** The enemy is slow. I can dominate the board space.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nI must move LEFT. It's the only legal move that doesn't kill me immediately. It keeps me alive to fight another turn.\n\n**LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25**\n\nLEFT",

We are currently at (8, 9) and that apple at (9, 2) is looking juicy, but we gotta make sure we don't get clipped by the enemy or trap ourselves!\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\n\n1.  **ANALYZE CURRENT POSITION:**\n    *   **Head:** (8, 9)\n    *   **Body:** [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n    *   **Enemy Head:** (2, 4) - They are moving around the bottom-left. Not an immediate threat to the top-right corner yet.\n\n2.  **CHECK MOVE OPTIONS FROM (8, 9):**\n\n    *   **UP:** Off board (y=10 is out). **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** To (8, 8).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (8, 8) is currently empty (`.`).\n        *   *My Body:* Does (8, 8) hit my body? My body is at (9,9), (9,8)... no (8,8). Safe from self.\n        *   *Enemy:* Enemy is at (2,4). Safe.\n        *   *Result:* **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (7, 9).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (7, 9) is currently empty (`.`).\n        *   *My Body:* Does (7, 9) hit my body? No.\n        *   *Enemy:* Safe.\n        *   *Result:* **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (9, 9).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (9, 9) contains my own body (the old head).\n        *   *Result:* **DEAD** (Crash into self).\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n    *   **Target:** The apple at (9, 2) is our best target for immediate growth. It's high value and currently uncontested.\n    *   **Pathing to (9, 2):**\n        *   If I go **LEFT to (7, 9)**: I move away from the target column (x=9). I would have to loop back around, which is inefficient and risks running into my own tail or the enemy if they expand.\n        *   If I go **DOWN to (8, 8)**: I stay in column 8. This allows me to descend the column and swing right towards x=9 to grab the apple. This keeps my options open and maintains proximity to the high-value apple at (9, 2).\n    *   **Enemy Trapping:** The enemy is at (2, 4). They are likely expanding downwards or left. I need to secure the top-right zone. Moving DOWN to (8, 8) expands my territory downwards while keeping the right flank open.\n\n4.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    I am choosing **DOWN** to (8, 8). This position keeps me alive, maintains a path to the apple at (9, 2), and doesn't cut off my escape routes. We need those apples to close the gap!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDescend column 8 to (8, 0) or near it, then sweep right to (9, 2) to eat the apple. Watch the enemy's movement; if they push up, we box them in. If we can get this apple, we keep the momentum going. 13 vs 21 apples is a gap, but we eat fast! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\n**LET'S GOOO!**\n\nDOWN",

A . . T T\n         8 A A . . . . . . 1 .  <-- We are here (8,8)\n         7 A . A . . . . . . T\n         6 . . . . . T . . . T\n         5 . . 0 . T T T T T T\n         4 . . T T T T . .

A A .\n        ```\n        *(Note: Board rendering might be slightly off from the text list, but I'm analyzing based on the coordinates provided. The text list is the source of truth.)*\n\n2.  **CHECK MOVE OPTIONS FROM (8, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** To (8, 9).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (8, 9) contains my own body (the previous head). **DEAD.**\n    *   **DOWN:** To (8, 7).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (8, 7) is currently `.` (empty) on the board representation.\n        *   *My Body:* Does (8, 7) hit my body? Looking at the list: (8, 9), (9, 9)... No. Safe.\n        *   *Enemy:* Safe.\n        *   *Result:* **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (7, 8).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (7, 8) is `.`.\n        *   *My Body:* No collision.\n        *   *Enemy:* Safe.\n        *   *Result:* **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (9, 8).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (9, 8) is part of my body (specifically (9, 8) is in the list: `[(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)...]`).\n        *   *Result:* **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n    *   **Options:** Only **DOWN** (to 8,7) and **LEFT** (to 7,8) are viable.\n    *   **Target Analysis:** The apple at (9, 2) is still the prime target. It's in the bottom-right corner.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   **LEFT (7,8):** Moves me away from the right edge where I need to be to reach (9,2). It pushes me toward the center/left, which is actually closer to the enemy's territory (top-left is dangerous).\n        *   **DOWN (8,7):** Moves me closer to the row (y=2) of the target apple. It keeps me in column 8, which is adjacent to the target column 9.\n    *   **Safety:** Moving DOWN opens up a path to spiral down the right side of the board. Moving LEFT pushes me into the \"dead zone\" in the middle where my own tail might trap me later.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** The enemy is at (2, 5). They are far away. I need to secure the bottom-right corner before they expand into it.\n\n4.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    I am choosing **DOWN** to (8, 7). This aligns perfectly with the long-term plan to descend column 8 and swing right to (9, 2). It keeps my right flank secure and denies the enemy access to the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue descending column 8 towards y=2. Once at y=2, move right to (9, 2) to eat the apple. If the enemy tries to flank up the right side, we cut them off. We need to close the apple gap!\n\nDOWN",

Looking at my body list: `(8,5)` is the 12th segment (index 11). **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT:** To (7, 6).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (7, 6) is `.` (empty).\n        *   *My Body:* No collision.\n        *   *Enemy:* Safe.\n        *   *Result:* **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** To (9, 6).\n        *   *Is it safe?* (9, 6) is `T` (Body). Looking at my body list: `(9,6)` is the 7th segment (index 6). **DEAD.**\n\n2.  **STRATEGIC EVALUATION:**\n    *   **Options:** **UP** to (8,7) and **LEFT** to (7,6).\n    *   **Target Analysis:** We have apples at (9,2) and (8,0) in our quadrant. (8,0) is blocked by my own body at (8,5) blocking the path down, so (9,2) is the target.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   **LEFT (7,6):** Moves us into the center of the board, opening up paths to the left side where the enemy is. This exposes us to immediate danger from the enemy at (2,7).\n        *   **UP (8,7):** Moves us back up the column. This seems counter-intuitive for getting to (9,2), BUT it opens up the move **RIGHT** to (9,7) on the next turn. (9,7) is currently empty and safe. Once we are at (9,7), we can go **DOWN** to (9,6), then (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) to eat the apple safely without hitting our own body.\n    *   **Enemy Threat:** Enemy is at (2,7). They are far away. We have the luxury of time to maneuver the edge safely.\n    *   **Safety:** Down is blocked by our own body. Right is blocked by our own body. Up and Left are the only safe moves. Up keeps us on the edge, Left moves us toward the center.\n\n3.  **FINAL DECISION:**\n    I am choosing **UP** to (8, 7). Why? Because moving Up allows me to swing **RIGHT** into column 9 on the next turn. From there, I can spiral down the right edge to get the apple at (9,2) safely. Moving Left puts me in the center where the enemy might collide with me. I need to stick to the edges and create a \"cage\" on the right side.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTrap the enemy on the left. Move Up to (8,7), then Right to (9,7). From there, spiral down the right edge (9,6 -> 9,5...) to secure the apple at (9,2). Keep the right side locked down.\n\nUP",
