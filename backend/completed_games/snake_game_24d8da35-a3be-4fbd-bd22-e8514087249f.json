The board is WIDE OPEN! But we gotta think like a PREDATOR! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLet's check my moves:\n\n*   **UP:** (9,8) -> On board? \u2705 Empty? \u2705 Safe? \u2705\n*   **DOWN:** (9,6) -> On board? \u2705 Empty? \u2705 Safe? \u2705\n*   **LEFT:** (8,7) -> On board? \u2705 Empty? \u2705 Safe? \u2705\n*   **RIGHT:** (10,7) -> On board? \u274c NOPE! Off the edge! DEAD! So RIGHT is ELIMINATED! \ud83d\udeab\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are all safe. Now, which one sets us up for the long game?\n\nWe need to think about the enemy. He's on the left side of the board. If we go LEFT (8,7), we're moving towards the center, which is good for controlling space. But there's an apple at (9,5)... DOWN (9,6) gets us closer to that apple, but is that the best play? We're not just content farmers, we're GLADIATORS! We need to think about cutting off the enemy's escape routes early.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: The enemy is at (2,4). The board is big right now, but we want to start moving to dominate the center and the right side, forcing him into the edges. If we go LEFT to (8,7), our next move could be DOWN or further LEFT, starting to carve a path. Going DOWN immediately feels a bit like we're hugging our starting corner. We need to be AGGRESSIVE and EXPANSIVE!\n\nI think LEFT is the move. It asserts dominance, moves us away from the corner, and gives us more options next turn. We're playing the board, not just chasing the first apple we see.\n\nLET'S GO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

He looks a little lost over there in the corner. \ud83d\ude02\n\nTurn 0, fresh start, fresh vibes. We start at (2, 4).\nLet's look at the loot. The board is looking JUICY \ud83c\udf4e.\nI see a massive cluster of apples right below us. Check these coordinates: (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (0, 1). That is FREE REAL ESTATE, chat! \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nSnake #1 is all the way over at (9, 7). He's probably going to waste time in the top right. While he's figuring out his controls, we're gonna get HUGE.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. We are going straight for the bag. The closest apple is at (2, 2).\n2. To get there, we need to head **DOWN**.\n3. Once we grab that, we pivot to (3, 2) or (2, 1). We gobble up that bottom-left sector and dominate the board size before he even knows what hit him.\n\nDon't worry about crashing yet, we have plenty of space. It's time to FEED. \ud83c\udf74 Let's get this W!\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nHead down to (2,2) to secure the first apple. Then immediately look to clean up (2,1) or (3,2). We need to reach size 3 or 4 ASAP to start applying pressure.\n\nDOWN",

It's FREE CONTENT! \ud83e\udd11\n\nHowever... we must think LONG TERM! If we go LEFT for the apple, our head is at (7,7). Next turn, our body segment will be at (8,7). That's fine.

That might be bad long-term... getting trapped in a corner is how you get COOKED! \ud83c\udf73\n\nLEFT towards the apple also moves us AWAY from the corner and towards the center.

We have the ADVANTAGE!\n\nENEMY STATUS: Head at (2,2), body at (2,3). He's looking T H I N.\n\nTIME TO SCOUT OUR OPTIONS! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n*   **UP to (7,8):** On board? \u2705 Empty? \u2705 (Board shows nothing at (7,8)) Safe? \u2705 CHECKS OUT!\n*   **DOWN to (7,6):** On board? \u2705 Empty? \u2753WAIT! The board shows an 'A' at (7,6)? No, looking at the chart... the A's are listed above. (7,6) is empty! BUT! Is it safe from a head-on collision? The enemy is at (2,2). He can't reach us in one move.

We have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nSTRATEGY CHECK \ud83e\udde0: We need to use our length advantage to start BOXING HIM IN! He's in the top-left quadrant. We're on the right. We want to CONTROL THE CENTER and CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES!\n\n*   **LEFT (6,7):** Moves us towards the center. From (6,7), our next moves could be UP/DOWN/LEFT, keeping options open. This is SOLID positioning. We're moving AWAY from the right-side wall, avoiding a potential trap.\n*   **UP (7,8):** Moves us along the top-right edge. Risky? This gets us closer to the top wall. Fewer options. Could get pinched later. Not ideal for controlling the board.\n*   **DOWN (7,6):** Puts us near some apples (6,6), (5,6). Tempting for content... but is it the best strategic play? It keeps us on the right side. Maybe we should be pushing leftward to pressure him!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: The enemy is small. If we get a head-on collision, WE WIN because we're longer! So we should be AGGRESSIVE! Start moving towards his general area (the left side) to cut off the board. Let's not chase apples on the right; let's chase the ENEMY! We want to force him into a corner or into our body!\n\nTHE VERDICT: LEFT is the move! It advances our position towards the center, gives us maximum future flexibility, and starts our aggressive march to CUT THE ENEMY'S SNAKE IN HALF! \ud83d\udd2a We are the hunter!

We stick to the **Spine Run**.\nIf we hesitate, he eats all the top apples and traps us at the bottom.\nWe are moving to **(5, 2)**.\nWhy?\n1.  **Lane Control:** It puts us directly under the apple at **(5, 3)** and the next one at **(5, 4)**. We are building a linear efficient path.\n2.  **The \"Chicken\" Game:** Snake #1 is almost certainly moving DOWN to **(5, 6)** to eat. That brings us face-to-face in Column 5.\n    *   Next turn: We grab **(5, 3)** (Score 3). He grabs a side apple or moves down (Score 2 or 3).\n    *   The turn after: The contest for **(5, 4)**. If we maximize our eating speed, we enter that collision with a higher score. Remember the rules: **If we crash head-on, the snake with more apples WINS.** We are playing for the checkmate!\n\nWe take the lane. We force him to either bail out or crash into a bigger, badder snake. Let's execute!\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nMove to (5, 2) to claim the lane. Then SNAP UP to (5, 3). If Snake #1 comes down the middle, we meet him at (5, 4) with a higher score and take the W. If he dodges, we own the center.\n\nRIGHT",

We eat, score goes to 3.\n3.  **THE TRAP:** Next turn, we will be looking at **(5, 4)**. He will likely be at (4, 6) or (5, 6). If we both race for the middle at (5, 5) in a few turns, guess what? **3 > 2**.\n4.  If we crash head-on and everyone dies, the snake with the most apples WINS.

Then immediately look to SNAP UP to (5, 4). We are racing Snake #1 for control of Column 5. If he eats (4, 6) and (5, 6), we force a showdown at (5, 5).

We need to grow safely while planning his demise!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We're smaller. We need to avoid him and grow. The top of the board has more open space. We go UP, then work our way right and down, using the top and right edges as a wall to guide him into a corner. We'll cut off his escape routes! Patience, Chat!

Score: 1 apple.\n**WHO'S THE ENEMY?** Snake #0, head at (5,4), body at [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]. He's size 5! Score: 4 apples. He's BIGGER than us.\n\n**OUR IMMEDIATE GOAL:** We need to GROW and BOX HIM IN! He's strong, so we can't face him head-on yet. We need to control the board and force him into a bad spot.\n\nCHECKING MOVES FROM (5,8):\n*   **UP to (5,9):** On board? \u2705. Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 Safe! Puts us on the top edge.\n*   **DOWN to (5,7):** On board? \u2705. Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 Safe! Moves us down, closer to the enemy.\n*   **LEFT to (4,8):** \ud83d\udea8 **SUICIDE!** That's our own body segment! INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATE THIS MOVE!\n*   **RIGHT to (6,8):** On board? \u2705. Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 Safe! Moves us right, along the edge.\n\nOKAY! THREE SAFE OPTIONS: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**WHAT'S THE ENEMY'S PLAY?** His head is at (5,4). He's gonna move AWAY from his body. He can go UP to (5,5), LEFT to (4,4), or RIGHT to (6,4). DOWN to (5,3) is his own body, so NO. He'll probably go for apples or try to expand. There's an apple at (5,6) above him and one at (6,6) to the right. He might move UP or RIGHT.\n\n**OUR STRATEGY:** We need to be AGGRESSIVE but SMART! We can't let him just eat apples freely. We want to position ourselves to cut off his escape routes and force him into a corner.\n\n*   **UP to (5,9):** Gets us to the top. Safe, but might be a bit passive. From there, we're a bit far from the action.\n*   **DOWN to (5,7):** \ud83d\ude08 **THIS IS THE PLAY!** This moves us DOWN towards the enemy! It's a bold move! From (5,7), we're directly above him. We can threaten to move further down next turn, putting pressure on him. We're not running; we're advancing! This positions us to potentially cut off his path upwards towards the apples at (5,6) and (6,6). We're challenging his space!\n*   **RIGHT to (6,8):** Also safe, moves us along the right edge. Could be useful for flanking, but it's less direct pressure on the enemy.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (5,7), we assess his new position. If he moved UP, we might be in a position to contest the space above him. If he moved laterally, we can continue our advance downward or shift to block him. The goal is to use our position to limit his movement options and force a mistake!\n\n**THE VIBE:** We're the hunter, not the prey! Let's pressure this guy and make him sweat! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

The plan to control the \"Golden Corridor\" was pure genius.\nSnake #1 is sitting up at (5, 8) with a tiny body, probably scared to come down. He has 1 apple. We have 4. The math is simple, chat: **WE ARE THE BIG FISH.** \ud83e\udd88\n\n**The Board State Analysis:**\n*   **The Prize:** Look at coordinates **(4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 6)**. Do you see that? It's a horizontal line of THREE APPLES. It's a Combo Meal waiting to be eaten! \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf5f\ud83e\udd64\n*   **The Setup:** My head is at (5, 4). One move UP puts me at **(5, 5)**.\n*   **The Trap:** From (5, 5), the apple at (5, 6) is just one hop away.\n*   **The \"Checkmate\":** If the enemy tries to rush down to steal that apple at (5, 6), it will take him 2 turns. It takes me 2 turns. If we collide head-on at (5, 6)... **I WIN.** Why? Because the rules say if we double-KO, the snake with more apples wins. And chat, we have WAY MORE APPLES. \ud83e\udde0\u2728\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1.  **MOVE UP** to (5, 5). This is the \"Throne Room\" tile. It connects to everything.\n2.  **FEAST:** Next turn, we go for the apple at (5, 6).\n3.  **CHAIN REACTION:** After eating (5, 6), we are perfectly positioned to eat (4, 6) or (6, 6). We are going to clear the board!\n4.  **INTIMIDATION:** By holding the center vertical line (x=5), we split the board in half. The enemy is trapped at the top.\n\nWe don't flinch. We take the space. We take the food. We take the win.\n\nUP",

He's STILL BIGGER! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**WHAT HAPPENED LAST TURN?** We moved DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7). AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We're putting pressure on him from above! Now he's directly below us at (5,5).

We cannot afford a head-on collision right now!\n\n*   **If we move DOWN to (5,6) and he moves LEFT/RIGHT:** Then we land on an empty cell (or maybe the apple gets eaten by him before we land?

Moving LEFT gets us closer to that potential growth!\n*   Moving RIGHT also has apples nearby, like (6,6). But the enemy is also likely to move right towards (6,5)/(6,6). Could get crowded.\n\n**THE PLAY:** Let's be AGGRESSIVE but not SUICIDAL! We go LEFT to (4,7). This avoids the potential head-on collision disaster, positions us to snag the apple at (4,6) next, and starts a flanking maneuver. We live to fight another turn and close the score gap! This is about long-term domination, not a quick gamble! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is bigger. Avoid direct head-on collisions until we close the apple gap. Use our agility to flank, eat apples, and gradually constrict his movement space. Target apples at (4,6) and control the left side of the board.\n\nLEFT",

We are bullying him off the objective!\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) is a rookie mistake (bait) because if he eats the apple, his tail stays put and we faceplant into a wall. \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\uddf1\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) is too passive. We don't farm; we hunt! \ud83e\udd81\n\n**STRATEGY FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nWe are force-feeding this win condition. If the crash happens, GG. If he dodges, we take (4, 6), then look to own the (3, x) column or sweep down to the cluster of apples at bottom left. Keep the pressure high!\n\nWE'RE GOING ALL IN, CHAT! HOLD ME! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We're still size 2, score 1.\n**WHERE'S THE ENEMY?** Snake #0's head is at **(5,6)**, body is long boi at [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]. He's size 5, score 5. He's STILL GOT THE LEAD! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**HE'S DIRECTLY TO OUR RIGHT!** This is a HORIZONTAL STANDOFF! Let's break down our options from (4,7):\n\n*   **UP to (4,8):** \ud83d\udd12 **LOCK IT IN!** On board? \u2705. Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 Safe! Moves us up, away from immediate danger. Good for creating space.\n*   **DOWN to (4,6):** On board? \u2705. Empty? \u274c WAIT! Board shows 'A' for apple! \ud83c\udf4e So it's SAFE (eating an apple is ALWAYS safe for the move itself)! This is HUGE! This gets us GROWTH, a POINT, and puts us closer to the enemy's body, potentially boxing him in!\n*   **LEFT to (3,7):** On board? \u2705. Empty? Board shows '.' \u2705 Safe! Moves us further left, widening the gap.\n*   **RIGHT to (5,7):** \ud83d\udea8 **SUICIDE!** That's our OWN BODY SEGMENT! INSTANT DEATH! ELIMINATED! \u274c\n\n**OKAY, THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, DOWN, LEFT.** DOWN EATS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WHAT'S THE ENEMY'S LIKELY MOVE FROM (5,6)?** He has to avoid his own body at (5,5). So he can go:\n*   UP to (5,7) \u2013 BUT WAIT, that's OUR OLD BODY! If he goes there, HE DIES! \ud83d\ude08 That's a free win for us! TROLL MOVE!\n*   DOWN to (5,5) \u2013 NOPE! That's his own neck! SUICIDE! He can't go there!\n*   LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 AHA! This is the CRITICAL POINT! That's where the APPLE is, and where we're considering going!\n*   RIGHT to (6,6) \u2013 On board? \u2705. Empty? \u274c It's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e He might go for that instead!\n\n**THE SHOWDOWN AT (4,6)!** If we BOTH go for that apple... HEAD-ON COLLISION! \ud83d\udca5 Who wins? He has 5 apples, we have 1. WE LOSE THE GAME. \u274c That's a disaster!\n\nBUT WAIT! Is it a guaranteed loss? Let's think... If he goes LEFT to (4,6) and we go DOWN to (4,6), it's a double KO. Game over, higher score wins. He wins.\n\n**SO DO WE GAMBLE?** ABSOLUTELY NOT! We cannot afford that risk. We need to be PATIENT and SMART!\n\n**THE SMART PLAY:** Let's take the APPLE at (4,6) but ONLY if we're sure he won't be there! Can we be sure? Not 100%, but we can read the situation.\n\nHe has TWO apple options: LEFT to (4,6) or RIGHT to (6,6). He might see the risk of a head-on collision with us and choose the SAFER apple on the right! If he goes right, the coast is clear for us to take the left apple! This is a calculated risk, but a GOOD one!\n\nTaking the apple is AGGRESSIVE GROWTH! It closes the score gap to 5-2 and makes our body longer, giving us more presence on the board! It's WORTH the calculated risk!\n\n**LEFT or UP are too passive.** We need to grow to compete!\n\n**THE DECISION:** We go for the CONTENT! We go for the GROWTH! We trust that the enemy will take the safer route to (6,6)! WE MOVE DOWN TO EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We just grew to size 3! Our new body will be at [(4,6), (4,7), (5,7)]. This starts to create a wall. Next turn, we need to assess the new board state. If the enemy took the right apple, he's at (6,6) and even bigger (score 6). We need to continue being aggressive but AVOID direct head-on collisions until we close the gap further. Look for opportunities to trap him against his own body or the board edge!\n\nDOWN",
