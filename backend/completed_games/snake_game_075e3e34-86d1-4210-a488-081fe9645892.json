The remaining apples are:\nA1 (3, 8) - Manhattan Distance (MD) from (9, 7): |9-3| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7\nA2 (5, 8) - MD from (9, 7): |9-5| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\nA3 (3, 3) - MD from (9, 7): |9-3| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\nA4 (0, 5) - MD from (9, 7): |9-0| + |7-5| = 9 + 2 = 11\nA5 (6, 5) - MD from (9, 7): |9-6| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThe nearest apples are (5, 8) and (6, 5), both distance 5.\n\n*   **Targeting (5, 8):** Requires moving LEFT and then UP.\n    *   Move LEFT to (8, 7): Distance to (5, 8) becomes 4 (3 L, 1 U).\n    *   Move UP to (9, 8): Distance to (5, 8) becomes 5 (4 L, 0 U). This moves in the wrong horizontal direction.\n\n*   **Targeting (6, 5):** Requires moving LEFT and then DOWN.\n    *   Move LEFT to (8, 7): Distance to (6, 5) becomes 4 (2 L, 2 D).\n    *   Move UP to (9, 8): Distance to (6, 5) becomes 6 (3 L, 3 D).\n\nLEFT to (8, 7) keeps both target options open and immediately reduces distance for both.\n\n**3. Analyze Competition Risk (Snake #1 at (5, 2)):**\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 2). It is highly likely targeting (3, 3) (MD 3) or (6, 5) (MD 2).\nIf Snake #1 targets (6, 5):\n*   Head (5, 2) -> (6, 2) (R) -> (6, 3) (U) -> (6, 4) (U) -> (6, 5) (U). 4 moves.\nIf Snake #1 targets (3, 3):\n*   Head (5, 2) -> (4, 2) (L) -> (3, 2) (L) -> (3, 3) (U). 3 moves.\n\nSince Snake #1 is prioritizing movement toward apples, (6, 5) is slightly closer in MD (5 vs 3, but travel time might favor (3, 3) if straight line path is available). Given the board layout, (6, 5) is competitive. My snake is far from (6, 5) (MD 5).\n\nSince (5, 8) is equally close to me (MD 5) and is much harder for Snake #1 to reach (MD 7: |5-5|+|8-2| = 6, actually). I should prioritize (5, 8).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves for Target (5, 8):**\n\n*   **LEFT to (8, 7):** Best choice for getting toward (5, 8).\n*   **UP to (9, 8):** Moves further away from the X coordinate target (5) and doesn't improve upon the Y coordinate (8).\n\n**4. Conclusion on Turn 6 Move:**\n\nMove LEFT to (8, 7) to start the diagonal movement towards the (5, 8) apple. This is the optimal strategic move.\n\n**[Long-term plan note for Turn 7]:**\nMy head will be at (8, 7). The target is (5, 8). I need 3 LEFT steps and 1 UP step. I will prioritize moving LEFT to X=5, then UP to Y=8.\nPlanned moves: L (to 8, 7), L (to 7, 7), L (to 6, 7), L (to 5, 7 - this brings me closest to (5, 8)), then UP (to 5, 8) to eat.

Best path reduction towards (5, 8).\n\n*   **Targeting (6, 5):** Requires 2 LEFT steps and 2 DOWN steps.\n    *   Move UP to (8, 8): MD to (6, 5) is 5 (2 L, 3 D).

LEFT is superior for (5, 8). Since competition for (5, 8) is virtually non-existent, and it is a high-value apple, let's prioritize it unless Snake 1 poses a threat.\n\n**3.

It is unlikely to contest (5, 8) or (6, 5) soon.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7), I reduce the path length to (5, 8) to 3 moves.\nPath: (8, 7) -> L -> (7, 7) -> L -> (6, 7) -> L -> (5, 7) -> U -> (5, 8).

(4 moves total)\n\nBoth LEFT and UP result in 4 total moves to eat (5, 8).\n\n*   Moving LEFT (to (7, 7)): Keeps me slightly lower down and closer to the center of the board.\n*   Moving UP (to (8, 8)): Puts me on the top edge immediately.\n\nGiven that I have plenty of space, moving LEFT seems strategically slightly better as it keeps access open to the central apples (like (6, 5)) and avoids trapping myself against the top wall too early if subsequent moves need to curve. The plan from the previous turn dictated focusing on the x-coordinate decrease first.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Turn 7 Move:**\n\nMove LEFT to (7, 7) to continue closing the distance to the target apple (5, 8).\n\n**[Long-term plan note for Turn 8 and beyond]:**\nHead at (7, 7). Target (5, 8).

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 at (7, 7):**\n\n*   **Own Body Check:** My body is at (8, 7), (9, 7). Moving RIGHT (to (8, 7)) is moving into my body segment (tail), which is lethal unless the tail moves away. Since my tail segment (9, 7) will become the new body segment if I don't eat, and (8, 7) will be my old head, moving RIGHT into (8, 7) is hitting my own body. **Kill.** (Wait, the body is [(8, 7), (9, 7)]. The segment right behind the head (7, 7) is (8, 7). Moving RIGHT to (8, 7) is moving backwards. **Kill.**)\n*   **Board Edge Check:** All adjacent squares ((7, 8), (7, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7)) are on the board.\n*   **Enemy Snake Check:** Snake 1 is far away. No immediate threat.\n\nSafe moves:\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Kill (Moving into own body segment just behind the head).\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary target remains Apple A2 (5, 8).\n\nDistances from current head (7, 7) to apples:\nA1 (3, 8) - MD: |7-3| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\nA2 (5, 8) - MD: |7-5| + |7-8| = 2 + 1 = 3 (Target)\nA3 (3, 3) - MD: |7-3| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\nA4 (0, 5) - MD: |7-0| + |7-5| = 7 + 2 = 9\nA5 (6, 5) - MD: |7-6| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nApples (5, 8) and (6, 5) are both MD 3. Both are excellent targets.\n\n*   **Targeting (5, 8) [L, U]:**\n    *   Move UP to (7, 8): MD to (5, 8) is 2 (2 L, 0 U/D). Path: (7, 7) -> U -> (7, 8) -> L -> (6, 8) -> L -> (5, 8). (3 moves to eat)\n    *   Move DOWN to (7, 6): MD to (5, 8) is 4 (2 L, 2 U). Worse.\n    *   Move LEFT to (6, 7): MD to (5, 8) is 2 (1 L, 1 U). Path: (7, 7) -> L -> (6, 7) -> U -> (6, 8) -> L -> (5, 8). (3 moves to eat)\n\n*   **Targeting (6, 5) [L, D, D]:**\n    *   Move UP to (7, 8): MD to (6, 5) is 4 (1 L, 3 D). Worse.\n    *   Move DOWN to (7, 6): MD to (6, 5) is 2 (1 L, 1 D). Path: (7, 7) -> D -> (7, 6) -> L -> (6, 6) -> D -> (6, 5). (3 moves to eat)\n    *   Move LEFT to (6, 7): MD to (6, 5) is 2 (0 L/R, 2 D). Path: (7, 7) -> L -> (6, 7) -> D -> (6, 6) -> D -> (6, 5). (3 moves to eat)\n\nAll three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) lead to eating an apple in 3 total moves. Since the previous turns have aimed for (5, 8), maintaining that course is advisable unless risk increases.\n\n**3. Decision between UP and LEFT for (5, 8):**\n\n*   Move UP to (7, 8) requires moves L, L, EAT. (3 moves total)\n*   Move LEFT to (6, 7) requires moves L, U, EAT or U, L, EAT. (3 moves total)\n\nBoth are equally efficient for (5, 8).\n\n**4. Analyzing (6, 5) vs (5, 8):**\n\nBoth are MD 3 and 3 moves away. (5, 8) is slightly higher priority because it opens up the upper left 'quadrant' of apples (A1 at (3, 8)) and keeps us away from Snake 1 (currently at (4, 1)) who is focusing on the bottom-center region (likely (3, 3)).\n\nBetween UP and LEFT to target (5, 8):\n*   Moving UP to (7, 8) places the snake head close to the top boundary (y=8).\n*   Moving LEFT to (6, 7) keeps the snake more central.\n\nMoving LEFT (6, 7) results in a path to (5, 8) of L, U, L.\nMoving UP (7, 8) results in a path to (5, 8) of L, L, U.\n\nGiven the existing strategy to gain horizontal progress first, moving LEFT to (6, 7) is marginally preferred. It maintains flexibility to pivot to (6, 5) if needed (only 2 D from (6, 7)).\n\n**5. Final Check on Competition (Snake #1 at (4, 1)):**\nSnake 1 is likely moving towards (3, 3) (MD 2). Even if it targets (6, 5) (MD 5), it is too far to contest in the next 3 moves. (5, 8) is completely safe from Snake 1.\n\nI will move LEFT, completing the second step of horizontal progression towards (5, 8).\n\n**[Long-term plan note for Turn 9 and beyond]:**\nHead at (6, 7). Target (5, 8). Next moves: L (to (5, 7)), then U (to (5, 8), EAT). This remains the highest priority target. Requires 2 more moves.\nPlanned subsequent moves: L, U.\n**[/Long-term plan note]**\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves based on Apple Proximity and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary target is A2 (5, 8). Also A5 (6, 5) is close.\n\nDistances from current head (6, 7) to apples:\nA1 (3, 8) - MD: |6-3| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\nA2 (5, 8) - MD: |6-5| + |7-8| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Target)\nA3 (3, 3) - MD: |6-3| + |7-3| = 3 + 4 = 7\nA4 (0, 5) - MD: |6-0| + |7-5| = 6 + 2 = 8\nA5 (6, 5) - MD: |6-6| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nTwo apples are MD 2 away: (5, 8) and (6, 5). Both can be reached in 2 moves (1 move to the adjacent square, 1 move to the apple).\n\n**A. Targeting (5, 8):**\nThe required moves are 1 LEFT and 1 UP, in any order.\n1.  **Move UP to (6, 8):** MD to (5, 8) is 1 (1 L). Next move: LEFT (Eat). (2 moves total)\n2.  **Move LEFT to (5, 7):** MD to (5, 8) is 1 (1 U). Next move: UP (Eat). (2 moves total)\n\n**B. Targeting (6, 5):**\nThe required moves are 2 DOWN.\n1.  **Move DOWN to (6, 6):** MD to (6, 5) is 1 (1 D). Next move: DOWN (Eat). (2 moves total)\n\n**3. Decision:**\n\nSince all three safe moves lead to eating an apple in 2 moves, we must select the move that best positions us for future apples and maintains safety from the opponent.\n\n*   **If I choose (6, 5):** I move DOWN, then DOWN (Eat). This moves me toward the center-bottom of the board. Next target would likely be (3, 3) (MD 3 from (6, 5)).\n    *   *Path:* (6, 7) -> D -> (6, 6) -> D (Eat (6, 5)).\n\n*   **If I choose (5, 8):** This maintains the high-priority upper quadrant path.\n    *   *Option 1 (UP first):* (6, 7) -> U -> (6, 8) -> L (Eat (5, 8)).\n    *   *Option 2 (LEFT first):* (6, 7) -> L -> (5, 7) -> U (Eat (5, 8)).\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n1.  **(6, 5) vs (5, 8):** Both are 2 moves away. (5, 8) is strategically better currently as we are already high up and it opens up (3, 8). (6, 5) pulls us away from the other high apples.\n\n2.  **UP vs LEFT (to target (5, 8)):**\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 8), I am on the top boundary (y=8).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (5, 7), I am away from the boundary and maintain options laterally. (5, 7) puts me closer to (3, 8) if I need to pivot, and also maintains distance from Snake 1 (at (5, 1)).\n\n*   Snake 1 at (5, 1):\n    *   Likely trajectories for Snake 1:\n        *   Toward (3, 3) (MD 4: L, L, U, U).\n        *   Toward (6, 5) (MD 5: U, U, U, U, R/L?). If Snake 1 moves U, U, U, U, then it's at (5, 5). Then R for (6, 5) or L for (4, 5). Too far. Snake 1 poses no threat to the upper apples.\n\nTherefore, targeting (5, 8) is still the optimal path. Choosing between UP and LEFT:\nMoving LEFT to (5, 7) is a good centralizing move that directly targets the required x-coordinate change for (5, 8) and keeps the snake close to the high-density apple area (3, 8), (5, 8).\n\nIf I move LEFT (5, 7), the next move is UP to eat (5, 8). This is clean.\n\nIf I move UP (6, 8), the next move is LEFT to eat (5, 8). This is also clean.\n\nSince the previous strategy involved moving LEFT to (6, 7), continuing horizontal progress before ascending to the apple is logical.\n\n**Long-term plan note for Turn 10 and beyond:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 7) to set up for eating apple (5, 8) next turn via UP. After eating (5, 8), the next target will be (3, 8) (2 moves away), or potentially pivoting to (3, 3) if the path looks clear and Snake 1 has moved away from the region (6, 5).\n\nLEFT",

I just ate the apple at (3, 8).\nApples remaining: (3, 3), (0, 5), (6, 5), (3, 0), (2, 6). (Wait, the provided Apple list in the prompt is: (3, 3), (0, 5), (6, 5), (3, 0), (2, 6). The apple at (3, 8) was consumed, so there should be 5 apples left).\nEnemy Snake #1 Head: (1, 1). Length: 1. Body: none. (Note: The board state description shows Snake 1 at (1, 1), not (2, 1) as implied by the last rationale's internal memory/plan. I will use (1, 1) as the current known position for S1).\n\nTargeting Strategy:\nFrom (3, 8):\n1. (3, 3): MD = 5 (5 DOWN) -> Nearest.\n2. (2, 6): MD = |2-3| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3\n3.

The apple at (3, 3) is MD 5, and critically, it lies directly in the path of 5 straight DOWN moves, which is a very easy trajectory.\n\nLet's re-evaluate proximity (Manhattan Distance, MD):\n*   (2, 6): 3 steps. (LEFT 1, DOWN 2)\n*   (3, 3): 5 steps. (DOWN 5)\n\n(3, 3) is a prime target because it is directly down. (2, 6) requires moving LEFT first, which might feel slightly less direct, but it is technically shorter.\n\nHowever, Snake 1 is at (1, 1) and is likely targeting the low apples (3, 0) (MD 3) or (3, 3) (MD 4). If I commit to (3, 3), I need to be fast. If I go for (2, 6), I move further away from Snake 1 and the competitive area, allowing me to grow safely before contesting the lower region.\n\nLet's look at the path to (2, 6).\n(3, 8) -> (2, 8) (LEFT) -> (2, 7) (DOWN) -> (2, 6) (DOWN). This route is safe from collision. Total 3 moves.\n\nLet's look at the path to (3, 3).\n(3, 8) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3). Total 5 moves.\n\nGiven the close proximity of (2, 6) and the need to avoid the lower part of the map until Snake 1 is dealt with or I have a size advantage, (2, 6) seems like the safer immediate target, giving me size 6 in 3 turns.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 at (3, 8):**\n\n*   **Own Body Check:** My body segments are at (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7).\n    *   Moving UP (3, 9): Safe.\n    *   Moving DOWN (3, 7): Safe.\n    *   Moving LEFT (2, 8): Safe.\n    *   Moving RIGHT (4, 8): **Kill** (moving into the segment immediately behind the head).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (2, 6):**\n\nThe first step toward (2, 6) is either DOWN (to (3, 7), MD to (2, 6) becomes 1+1=2 closer) or LEFT (to (2, 8), MD to (2, 6) becomes 1+2=3, same MD but in the correct x-column).\n\n*   Move DOWN to (3, 7): MD to (2, 6) is 1 + 1 = 2 (Net 1 step shorter). This is the immediate path optimization.\n*   Move LEFT to (2, 8): MD to (2, 6) is 1 + 2 = 3 (Net 1 step shorter). This sets up the X-coordinate correctly.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 7), the next step must be LEFT (to (2, 7)) or DOWN (to (3, 6)). Moving LEFT leads to (2, 6) quicker.\n(3, 8) -> (3, 7) [DOWN] -> (2, 7) [LEFT] -> (2, 6) [DOWN]. Total 3 moves.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 8), the next step must be DOWN.\n(3, 8) -> (2, 8) [LEFT] -> (2, 7) [DOWN] -> (2, 6) [DOWN]. Total 3 moves.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT yield a 3-move path. Moving DOWN keeps me centrally located for one more step, and keeps me aligned with (3, 3) if I change my mind. Let's aim DOWN for the first move.\n\n**3. Collision Check (Snake 1 at (1, 1)):**\n\nSnake 1 is at (1, 1). Possible moves for S1: (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2).\nMy target cells are (3, 7), (2, 8), (3, 9).\nSnake 1 is too far to influence my current move, or my move towards (2, 6).\n\n**4. Final Decision for Turn 13:**\n\nTarget (2, 6). Both DOWN and LEFT are equivalent in path length. I will choose DOWN to keep the option open for a quick descent towards (3, 3) if Snake 1 moves harmlessly elsewhere.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTarget apple (2, 6). Move DOWN to (3, 7). The likely subsequent moves will be LEFT to (2, 7) and then DOWN to (2, 6). Once (2, 6) is secured, the next target will depend on Snake 1's position, but options will be (6, 5) or revisiting the low apples (3, 3) or (3, 0).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Collision/Enemy Check (Snake 1 at (2, 1)):**\n\nSnake 1 is at (2, 1). It is currently far away from my target area in the top-middle/left.\nS1 is likely looking at (3, 3) (MD 3, e.g., UP, UP, RIGHT) or (3, 0) (MD 1, e.g., DOWN).\n\nI am moving in the middle to upper half of the board (Y=7, towards Y=6). Snake 1 is at Y=1. No risk of collision in this turn.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nSince S1 poses no threat to (2, 6), I only need to decide between LEFT and DOWN.\n\n*   Moving LEFT to (2, 7) puts me directly in the (X=2) column, ready for the final DOWN move. This may be marginally preferred for spatial alignment.\n*   Moving DOWN to (3, 6) keeps me in the (X=3) column, ready for the final LEFT move.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum toward the X coordinate change first. Moving LEFT to (2, 7) feels slightly more decisive for obtaining the (2, 6) apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nExecute LEFT move to (2, 7). Next turn, execute DOWN move to (2, 6) and eat the apple. After eating, I will be size 6. I will then evaluate the position of S1, but the next target will likely be (3, 3) or (6, 5), depending on S1's relative distance.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (0, 5):**\n\n*   **Target MD from (1, 6) is 2.** I aim to reach (0, 5) in 1-2 moves.\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 7):** MD to (0, 5) from (1, 7) = 1 + 2 = 3. Moves away from the apple. Bad.\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 5):** MD to (0, 5) from (1, 5) = 1 + 0 = 1. Excellent. Next move can be LEFT to eat.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 6):** MD to (0, 5) from (0, 6) = 0 + 1 = 1. Excellent. Next move can be DOWN to eat.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT get me 1 step away from the apple (0, 5).\n\n**3. Collision/Enemy Check (Snake 1 at (3, 1)):**\n\nS1 is at (3, 1). S1's likely targets are (3, 0) (MD 1) or (2, 0) (MD 2).\nS1's safe moves (assuming it avoids the walls/itself): UP (4, 3, 2?), DOWN (3, 0/eat), LEFT (2, 1), RIGHT (4, 1).\n\nIf S1 moves:\n*   UP (3, 2): No threat.\n*   DOWN (3, 0): Eats an apple. No threat to me.\n*   LEFT (2, 1): No threat.\n*   RIGHT (4, 1): No threat.\n\nI am operating far away from S1, so direct collision is highly unlikely.\n\n**4. Choosing between DOWN and LEFT:**\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance to (0, 5) to 1.\n\n*   If I choose **DOWN to (1, 5)**: I hit the target next turn with LEFT.\n    *   (1, 5) is also close to the apple at (0, 5).\n    *   This position gives me good options after eating: move RIGHT (2, 5) towards (3, 3) or UP (1, 6) (retrace).\n\n*   If I choose **LEFT to (0, 6)**: I hit the target next turn with DOWN.\n    *   (0, 6) is on the wall. While this is fine for eating (0, 5), movement options afterwards are limited to UP (wall), DOWN (0, 5 apple), RIGHT (1, 6).\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 5) keeps me one step off the wall and sets me up equally well for reaching the target (0, 5) next turn via a LEFT move. It potentially offers slightly better retreat/reorientation options if needed after eating, compared to hugging the X=0 wall.\n\nLet's stick with the most direct unconstrained path: DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next 2-3 turns):**\n1. Move DOWN to (1, 5).\n2. Move LEFT to (0, 5) (Eat). My head is (0, 5). My body grows, tail moves to (5, 8).\n3. Move away from the wall, perhaps UP to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 5), then start moving towards (3, 3) or (6, 5). (3, 3) seems most contested/closest.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 at (0, 4):**\n\n*   **Own Body Check:** My body starts at (0, 5).\n    *   Moving UP (to 0, 5): **Kill** (moving into the segment immediately behind the head).\n    *   Moving DOWN (to 0, 3): Safe.\n    *   Moving RIGHT (to 1, 4): Safe.\n    *   Moving LEFT (to -1, 4): **Kill** (off board).\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (3, 3):**\n\nThe goal is to move toward (3, 3).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 0, 3):**\n    *   New Head: (0, 3). MD to (3, 3) = 3 + 0 = 3.\n    *   This is the optimal direction vertically. Next turn, I can move RIGHT (1, 3).\n    *   If I choose DOWN, I hug the left wall, maintaining proximity to the target.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 1, 4):**\n    *   New Head: (1, 4). MD to (3, 3) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   This is the optimal direction horizontally. Next turn, I can move RIGHT (2, 4) or DOWN (1, 3).\n\nBoth moves result in an MD of 3 next turn. Moving RIGHT gets me off the X=0 wall immediately, which keeps more future options open (e.g., prevents me from being trapped by my body at (0, 5) if I were to continue moving vertically). The plan from the previous turn suggested: (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) or (3, 4). Moving RIGHT is consistent with this plan and opens up the board.\n\n**3. Collision/Enemy Check (Snake 1 at (1, 0)):**\n\nSnake 1 is at (1, 0). S1 is likely moving towards (2, 0) or (3, 0), or potentially up towards (1, 1).\n*   If S1 moves UP (to 1, 1), it is far from (1, 4). Safe.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT (to 2, 0), it is far from (1, 4). Safe.\n*   If S1 moves DOWN (to 1, -1), S1 dies.\n*   If S1 moves LEFT (to 0, 0), it is far from (1, 4). Safe.\n\nThere is no immediate collision risk.\n\n**4. Final Choice:**\n\nMove RIGHT to (1, 4). This move is safe, reduces the MD to (3, 3) to 3 on the next turn, and repositions the snake to approach the main target (3, 3) efficiently.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nT20: Move RIGHT to (1, 4). MD to (3, 3) = 3.\nT21: Move RIGHT to (2, 4). MD to (3, 3) = 2.\nT22: Move DOWN to (2, 3). MD to (3, 3) = 1.\nT23: Move RIGHT to (3, 3) (Eat).\n\nIf S1 is still active, I need to keep an eye on a potential secondary target (5, 4) if S1 competes for (3, 3). Given S1's starting position, it appears focused on the bottom apples, leaving (3, 3) relatively uncontested for now.\n\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (3, 3):**\n\nThe target is (3, 3).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (to 1, 3):**\n    *   New Head: (1, 3). MD to (3, 3) = 2 + 0 = 2.\n    *   This is efficient. Next move can be RIGHT (2, 3) or RIGHT (2, 3).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 2, 4):**\n    *   New Head: (2, 4). MD to (3, 3) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   This is also efficient. Next move can be DOWN (2, 3) or RIGHT (3, 4).\n\nBoth decrease the distance to the optimum length (2).\n\n**3. Analyze Trajectory and Conflict:**\n\nThe previous plan was: T21: (2, 4) -> T22: (2, 3) -> T23: (3, 3) (Eat).\n\n*   If I move RIGHT to (2, 4): I am perfectly positioned to hit (2, 3) or (3, 4) next. This maintains a clear path.\n*   If I move DOWN to (1, 3): The path is (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) (Eat). This is slightly more direct vertically and achieves the MD of 2 immediately.\n\nLet's look at S1 at (2, 0). S1's body is (1, 0).\nS1 likely moves to (3, 0) (Eats apple) or (2, 1). It is too far for head-on conflict.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to MD 2.\n\nChoosing RIGHT (to 2, 4):\nPros: Consistent with prior pathing (moving along Y=4 horizon), gives the option to turn down at (2, 4) to (2, 3) or cross further right to (3, 4).\nCons: Puts me closer to potential congestion if I decide to go for (5, 4) later, but that's not a concern now.\n\nChoosing DOWN (to 1, 3):\nPros: Aligns me more directly with the Y=3 level.\nCons: Puts me momentarily back near the wall X=1. If I chose to go for (3, 0) later, this is better, but (3, 3) is primary.\n\nSince the goal is (3, 3), both are equally good for distance. I prefer the move that maintains more options, which is generally moving away from the body parts/walls. Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) gets me further into the open board area faster.\n\nMy long-term plan supports moving RIGHT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nT21: Move RIGHT to (2, 4). MD to (3, 3) = 2.\nT22: Move DOWN to (2, 3). MD to (3, 3) = 1.\nT23: Move RIGHT to (3, 3) (Eat).\n\nIf S1 moves to (3, 0) to eat, it will be busy there. We should secure (3, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

If S1 ate (3, 0) last turn, it means 1) the apple list in the previous rationale was wrong, or 2) S1 moved onto a vacant square.

Suboptimal (increases distance).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are excellent options, leading to an MD of 1.\n\n**3. Conflict Check:**\n\nS1 is at (3, 0). S1 is far away. Its possible moves (if safe) are (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 0) (suicide unless (2, 0) is tail, but (2, 0) is body segment 1). (4, 0) or (3, 1) are most likely. It poses no threat to (3, 3) next move.\n\n**4. Choosing between DOWN and RIGHT:**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3), I can move RIGHT to (3, 3) next turn (Eat).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I can move DOWN to (3, 3) next turn (Eat).\n\nBoth are equally efficient for eating (3, 3).\n\nIf I move DOWN (2, 3): I am closer to the cluster of apples (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4) which are on Y=4, and (6, 5) which is on Y=5. After eating (3, 3), I'd be at (3, 3). Moving UP to (3, 4) and then RIGHT towards the others seems natural.\n\nIf I move RIGHT (3, 4): I am already at Y=4. After eating (3, 3), I'd be at (3, 3) again.\n\nThe choice is largely arbitrary since both allow eating next turn.
