          "rationale": "LET'S GOOOO CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 Snake #0 at (2,6), Snake #1 at (6,0). Both of us have 0 apples. Board is FRESH. We gotta play this SMOOTH and AGGRESSIVE. Let's plot.\n\nFirst, let's check our moves. Head at (2,6). Possible moves:\n- UP to (2,7): Check... empty on board state (row 7, col 2 is dot). No snake bodies there. Safe!\n- DOWN to (2,5): Check... empty (row 5, col 2 is dot). Safe!\n- LEFT to (1,6): Check... empty (row 6, col 1 is dot). Safe!\n- RIGHT to (3,6): Check... empty (row 6, col 3 is dot). Safe!\n\nAll moves are technically safe right now. Now, where is the enemy? Snake #1 is at (6,0) - bottom row, far right side. He's way down there. I'm at (2,6) - top half, left side. We are separated.\n\nWhat's the strategy? I need to dominate the board and box him in. He's currently on the bottom right. If I stay on the left side, I can cut him off from the apples on the left.\n\nApples on the left side: (0,2), (0,9), (1,3). \nApples on the right side: (9,6), (7,5), (9,0), (8,1), (7,1), (6,8), (5,4), (3,4), (5,1), (6,2), (8,4).\n\nWait, (3,4) is somewhat central. (5,4) is central-right. (6,2) is right side. (8,4) is right side. (9,0) is right bottom corner.\n\nEnemy is at (6,0). He is very close to (9,0) and (8,1), (7,1), (5,1). He will likely try to go UP or RIGHT to get those apples. \n\nIf I move UP to (2,7), I'm getting closer to (0,9) and (1,3). That puts me in the top-left quadrant. This creates a vertical barrier on the left side. \nIf I move LEFT to (1,6), I'm going left. (0,9) is top-left. (0,2) is bottom-left.\nIf I move DOWN to (2,5), I'm moving towards the center but lower.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,6), I'm moving towards the center-right.\n\nLet's look at the enemy's perspective. He is at (6,0). \nIf he moves UP to (6,1), he risks hitting (6,2) (which is an apple) or getting closer to the central apples. \nIf he moves RIGHT to (7,0), he risks hitting the wall (8,0, 9,0) but (9,0) is an apple.\nIf he moves LEFT to (5,0), he is safe but moving away from apples.\n\nI want to force a confrontation or box him in. If I take the LEFT side, he is forced to the RIGHT side. The board is 10x10. If I control the left half (x=0 to 4), he is stuck on the right (x=5 to 9).\n\nLet's look at the apples on the left:\n(0,2), (1,3), (0,9). \n(0,2) is very close to me if I go DOWN and LEFT.\n(0,9) is top left corner.\n(1,3) is center-left.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,7), I am securing the top-left area. (0,9) is there. (2,8) is an apple further up left. (2,8) is an apple! Wait, looking at the list: (2,8) is an apple. Yes!\nBoard state shows:\nRow 8: `. . A . . . A . . .`\nThis is (2,8) and (6,8). \nSo (2,8) is an apple right above me (x=2, y=8). My head is at (2,6).\nTo get to (2,8), I need to go UP twice.\nMove 1: UP to (2,7).\nMove 2: UP to (2,8) - EAT APPLE.\n\nThis seems like a strong plan. Secure the apple at (2,8). This also keeps me on the left side x=2. This prevents the enemy from easily crossing over to the left side (he's at x=6). \n\nLet's check safety of (2,7). Is anything there?\nBoard state:\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . . . .` (All dots)\nRow 8: `. . A . . . A . . .` (Dot at (2,7)? No, row 8 is y=8. Row 7 is y=7. (2,7) is Row 7, Col 2. It's empty.)\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision? The enemy is at (6,0). He cannot reach (2,7) in one turn. Distance is huge. \n\nSo, moving UP seems very safe and strategic. It grabs a future apple and cuts the board in half vertically (roughly).\n\nLet's consider other moves just to be thorough.\nDOWN: (2,5). There are apples at (3,4) and (5,4) and (5,1). This is the center-right area. If I go down, I'm entering the \"danger zone\" where the enemy might also go (since he's at y=0, he will likely go up). I don't want to meet him in the center if I can avoid it. I want to isolate him.\nLEFT: (1,6). This also moves me left. (1,3) is an apple below left. But (2,8) is closer if I go up.\nRIGHT: (3,6). This moves me towards the center. This is risky because it brings me closer to the enemy's potential path.\n\nConclusion: UP to (2,7) is the best move. It's safe, it targets an apple (2,8) next turn, and it establishes control over the left side of the board.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2,7). Next turn, move UP to (2,8) to eat the apple and grow. Then assess the enemy's position and continue to hold the left flank.\n\nLET'S GO CHAT! WE RUSHING TOP LEFT!\n\nUP",

We own the board!\n\nLet's break down the current state. My head is at **(2,7)**. The enemy is at **(6,1)**. We are both size 1 (just heads, no bodies). No apples eaten yet.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (6,1). Looking at the board state and the apple list, there are apples all over the place, but specifically:\n- **(8,1)** is an apple. To get there, he would need to move RIGHT to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1).\n- **(9,0)** is an apple. To get there, he would need to move DOWN (or stay y=1 and go around... no, (9,0) is directly below (9,1)). Actually, (9,1) is an apple per the list? Let me check the list: `(8,1), (7,1)` are on row 1. `(9,0)` is on row 0.\n- He is at (6,1). The cell immediately to his right `(7,1)` is an apple.\n- The cell `(6,2)` is an apple above him.\n\nIf he moves **RIGHT** to (7,1) to eat the apple, he grows.\nIf he moves **UP** to (6,2) to eat the apple, he grows.\nIf he moves **DOWN** to (6,0), he is safe but doesn't eat.\nIf he moves **LEFT** to (5,1), he is safe but moves away from the dense apple cluster on the right side (which includes `(5,1), (6,2), (8,1), (7,1)`).\n\nMost aggressive players will take the apple. He is at `(6,1)` and `(7,1)` is an apple. **I predict Snake #1 will move RIGHT to (7,1).**\n\n**My Options (Head at 2,7):**\n1.  **UP to (2,8):** This is an **APPLE** on the board state! Row 8, col 2 is marked 'A'. Eating this gives me a score of 1 and immediate growth. This also pushes me further into the top-left quadrant, isolating me from the enemy.\n2.  **DOWN to (2,6):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (1,7):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3,7):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI need to secure food and grow. The apple at (2,8) is literally right above my head. It's free real estate.\nIf I take (2,8), my body will be at (2,7) next turn. This forms a vertical barrier on the left side (x=2).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,1) as predicted, he will be at (7,1) with a body segment at (6,1).\nThis creates a massive distance between us. I am securing the top-left corner, he is stuck on the bottom-right.\n\n**Risk Check:**\nIs there any chance the enemy moves UP or LEFT into my path?\n- Enemy at (6,1). I am at (2,7).\n- If he moves UP to (6,2), I am at (2,7) or (2,8). No collision.\n- If he moves LEFT to (5,1), I am at (2,7) or (2,8). No collision.\n- The only collision risk is if he moves into my *future* body, but he's too far.\n\n**The Plan:**\nMove **UP** to (2,8). Eat the apple. Grow to length 2. Establish dominance over the left side of the board. Force the enemy to fight for the scraps on the right.\n\nLET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nI'm at (2,7) and I see a delicious apple at (2,8) directly above me. The enemy is at (6,1) and likely greedy for the apple at (7,1). By moving UP, I secure an immediate point, grow my size, and continue to separate myself from the enemy on the left side of the board. This is the safest and most profitable move. I will claim the top-left territory.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

The enemy is creeping up\u2014let's see where they went.\n\n**CHECKING THE BOARD:**\n- **My new body:** Head at **(2,8)**, Body at **(2,7)**.\n- **Enemy move prediction:** I predicted he'd go to (7,1). If he did, he's there now with a body at (6,1). If he grabbed the apple, he's size 2.\n- **Apple check:** The apple at (2,8) is now MY body (digesting). The apple at (0,9) is top-left corner. The apple at (5,4) is central.\n\n**ANALYZING MY MOVE (Head at 2,8):**\nI am in the top row (y=8). My options are:\n1.  **UP (2,9):** Valid board space. (0,9) is an apple way on the left, but (2,9) is empty.\n2.  **LEFT (1,8):** Valid. Empty.\n3.  **RIGHT (3,8):** Valid. Empty.\n4.  **DOWN (2,7):** **DEATH TRAP!** That is my own body. Hitting yourself = instant loss. Never do this.\n\n**STRATEGY - DON'T GET TRAPPED:**\nIf I go UP to (2,9), I'm at the top wall. Next turn, my only safe moves would be LEFT or RIGHT (since I can't go UP again without hitting the wall, and DOWN is my body). That limits me to 2 options.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,8), I'm moving toward the center but keeping the top row open. I could go UP to (3,9) or LEFT to (2,8) [blocked by my body] or RIGHT to (4,8). Actually, (3,8) gives me more freedom.\nIf I go LEFT to (1,8), I'm moving toward the corner apple (0,9). This is a strong territorial move. I can claim the corner.\n\n**DECISION:**\nI want to dominate the left side. The apple at (0,9) is a beacon. Moving **LEFT** to (1,8) puts me one step away from securing that corner.\nAlso, looking at the potential enemy position (likely (7,1) or (6,2)), there is ZERO chance of collision. I'm top-left, he's bottom-right.\n\n**RISK CHECK:**\n- **LEFT to (1,8):** Safe. Not my body. Not enemy body (he's miles away). On board.\n- **Future options:** From (1,8), I can go UP to (1,9), LEFT to (0,8), or DOWN to (1,7). Plenty of space.\n\nLet's tighten the noose. Claim the corner. Keep the pressure on.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nYo Chat, we're scaling the walls! \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I'm at (2,8) and I see that delicious corner apple at (0,9) calling my name. Moving **LEFT** to (1,8) secures my position in the top-left quadrant. The enemy is likely still scrapping for scraps on the right side of the board. By moving left, I claim territory and keep my escape routes open (I can go UP next or DOWN). If I went UP to (2,9), I'd hit the wall and limit my mobility. Left is the aggressive, controlling play. Let's box him in!\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Let\\'s parse.\\n\\nBoard state shows:\\n\\nRow 9: \"9 A . . . . . . . . .\". That likely indicates apple at (0,9). Actually coordinate system bottom-left (0,0). Row 9 is y=9. It shows \"A\" at column 0. So apple at (0,9). Good.\\n\\nRow 8: \"8 . 0 T . . . A . . .\". So at (1,8) is snake #0 head (0). At (2,8) is its tail (T). At (6,8) is apple.\\n\\nRow 7: \"7 . . . . . . . A . .\". Apple at (7,7).\\n\\nRow 6: \"6 . . . . . . . . . A\". Apple at (9,6).\\n\\nRow 5: \"5 . . . . . . . A . .\". Apple at (7,5).\\n\\nRow 4: \"4 . . . A . A . . A .\". Apples at (3,4), (5,4), (8,4).\\n\\nRow 3: \"3 . A . . . . 1 A . .\". So at (1,3) apple, at (6,3) is \"1\" head of our snake. At (7,3) apple.\\n\\nRow 2: \"2 A . . . . . T . . .\". Apple at (0,2). Also our body? It shows T at (6,2) probably tail. Indeed at (6,2) tail.\\n\\nRow 1: \"1 . . . . . A . A A .\". Apples at (5,1), (7,1), (8,1).\\n\\nRow 0: \"0 . . . . . . . . . A\". Apple at (9,0).\\n\\nThus our snake currently: head (6,3), tail (6,2). Length 2.\\n\\nWe need to choose move now (turn 4). Need to consider opponent\\'s possible move: opponent head at (1,8) with body at (2,8). Actually snake #0: head (1,8), tail (2,8). Length 2.\\n\\nWe need to avoid collisions.\\n\\nWe consider our possible moves from (6,3):\\n\\nUP -> (6,4). Is that empty? Let\\'s check board: At (6,4) column 6 row 4: At row 4 there\\'s \" . . . A . A . . A .\": columns 0-9. So col0 \\'.\\' col1 \\'.\\' col2 \\'.\\' col3 \\'A\\' col4 \\'.\\' col5 \\'A\\' col6 \\'.\\' col7 \\'.\\' col8 \\'A\\' col9 \\'.\\'. So (6,4) is \\'.\\' empty. Good.\\n\\nDOWN -> (6,2) which is our own tail; moving into tail is allowed? In snake games moving into your own tail is illegal because tail will move out only if not growing; but moving into tail\\'s cell on same turn is considered moving backwards? Actually rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That\\'s hitting yourself. You\\'re DEAD.\" The cell behind head is (6,2) currently tail, but body length 2. So it\\'s directly behind head, thus moving backwards and is illegal. So DOWN invalid.\\n\\nLEFT -> (5,3). Check board row3 column5: Row 3 shows \" . A . . . . 1 A . .\": columns: 0 \\'.\\' 1 \\'A\\' 2 \\'.\\' 3 \\'.\\' 4 \\'.\\' 5 \\'.\\' 6 \\'1\\' 7 \\'A\\' 8 \\'.\\' 9 \\'.\\'. So (5,3) is \\'.\\' empty. Good.\\n\\nRIGHT -> (7,3). That\\'s an apple at (7,3). Apple present. So moving RIGHT will eat apple, grow length to 3 and get point. That seems beneficial. Need to ensure safe: Cell (7,3) currently has apple but also empty regarding bodies. So safe.\\n\\nNow opponent\\'s possible moves from (1,8): possible up (1,9), down (1,7), left (0,8), right (2,8) which is its own tail (illegal). Can\\'t move into its own tail (backwards). So allowed: up, down, left. We need to consider potential head-on collisions: If we move to a cell that opponent also moves into same turn, both die. But our target cells are (6,4) (UP), (5,3) (LEFT), (7,3) (RIGHT). Opponent will be far away, not those cells. So safe.\\n\\nThus all three moves are safe. Now evaluate strategic: prefer apple capture and future options.\\n\\nIf we move RIGHT to (7,3) we get apple, length becomes 3: head (7,3), then (6,3), then (6,2). That gives us extra body maybe slight risk but still central.\\n\\nAfter move, our new head (7,3) adjacency options next turn: Up (7,4) is empty? Row 4 col7 \\'.\\' yes empty. Right (8,3) row3 col8 \\'.\\' empty. Left (6,3) is our body (can\\'t go there as that is moving backwards? Actually after growing, body: positions: head (7,3), then (6,3), then (6,2). The cell behind head is (6,3) which is body; moving left would be moving into its body (backwards) illegal. Down (7,2): row2 col7 \\'.\\' empty. So we have three possible moves (up, right, down). Good.\\n\\nIf we go UP to (6,4), we would be at (6,4) head, body (6,3), tail (6,2). That\\'s vertical line length 3. Options next turn: Up (6,5) empty? row5 col6 \\'.\\'; Right (7,4) empty; Left (5,4) has apple at (5,4). Down would be back into (6,3) illegal. So also good, include apple to the left.\\n\\nIf we go LEFT to (5,3), head (5,3), body (6,3), tail (6,2). Options: Up (5,4) apple; Right (6,3) illegal; Left (4,3) empty; Down (5,2) empty. So also good and immediate apple.\\n\\nWhich is best considering opponent location? Opponent at top-left region, far. We want to dominate central area and maybe later box him.

We are tied. I need to be careful, but I also need to be aggressive. The board is 10x10. Coordinates: (0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right. I am Snake 0.\n\n**Current State:**\nMy Head: (1, 8)\nMy Body: [(2, 8)]\nEnemy Head: (6, 3)\nEnemy Body: [(6, 2)]\nApples: (9,6), (0,2), (7,5), (9,0), (0,9), (1,3), (8,1), (7,1), (6,8), (5,4), (3,4), (5,1), (8,4), (7,3), (7,7)\n\n**My Previous Move:**\nI went LEFT from (2,8) to (1,8). This was to chase the apple at (0,9) and claim the top-left corner. It was a safe move. From (1,8), my body is at (2,8).\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1,8):**\nI must avoid:\n1.  Going off board.\n2.  Hitting my own body (2,8).\n3.  Hitting the enemy body (if I knew where it moved, I'd check, but for my move this turn, I only know where the enemy *currently* is. Wait, the board state shows the enemy at (6,3) and (6,2). That is Turn 3 start state. I am making my move for Turn 3. The enemy moves simultaneously. So I must anticipate where he *could* go. But for my survival, I just need to ensure my destination is not currently occupied by a snake body, and I'm not moving backwards. However, simultaneous movement means an enemy *could* move into my path. I'll focus on my survival first, then aggression.\n\n**My Options from (1,8):**\n1.  **UP (1,9):** Top row. (0,9) is an apple. (1,9) is empty. Is it safe? Yes, it's empty. Is it smart? It puts me in the top corner. From (1,9), I can go DOWN (1,8 - my body), LEFT (0,9 - apple), or RIGHT (2,9). Wait, (1,8) is my current head. My body is (2,8). If I go UP to (1,9), my body will shift. Old head (1,8) becomes body. Old body (2,8) becomes... tail? Yes. So from (1,9), my body will be (1,8). (2,8) will be the tip of the tail (assuming I don't eat an apple). If I eat an apple, I grow.\n    *   If I go UP to (1,9): I move towards the apple at (0,9). I am cornering myself. But I can go LEFT into the apple. Corner play is risky but can be strong if I control it.\n2.  **DOWN (1,7):** (1,7) is empty (checked board: row 7 col 1 is '.' in the ascii art? Wait, row 7 is y=7. (1,7) is row 7, col 1. The board shows row 7: ` . . . . . . . A . . ` (y=7). Col 1 is the second char. It's a dot (empty). So DOWN is valid.\n    *   From (1,7), I have options: (1,6), (0,7), (2,7). Good mobility.\n3.  **LEFT (0,8):** (0,8) is empty? Row 8: ` . 0 T . . . A . . . ` (Wait, I am at (1,8). (0,8) is the first column. Looking at the board representation:\n    ```\n     9 A . . . . . . . . .\n     8 . 0 T . . . A . . .\n     7 . . . . . . . A . .\n    ```\n    (1,8) is the '0'. (0,8) is the char before '0'. That is a dot. It is empty.\n    *   From (0,8), I am at the left wall. Options: UP (0,9) [Apple], DOWN (0,7) [Empty? Row 7 col 0 is '.'], LEFT [Off board]. So I have 2 options. It's not ideal to be against the wall unless I'm eating.\n4.  **RIGHT (2,8):** **DEATH.** That is my own body (2,8). I died last turn if I did this. Wait, looking at the board:\n    ```\n     8 . 0 T . . . A . . .\n    ```\n    Wait, I am at (1,8). My body is listed as `[(2,8)]`. The board shows `0` at (1,8) and `T` (tail) at (2,8).\n    So RIGHT into (2,8) is hitting myself. **INVALID.**\n\n**Analysis & Strategy:**\nMy goal is to dominate. I am size 2. Enemy is size 2.\nApple at (0,9) is very close.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I am adjacent to (0,9). Next turn, I can eat it.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I am adjacent to (0,9). Next turn, I can eat it.\nIf I go DOWN to (1,7), I am moving away from the immediate apple at (0,9).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy is at (6,3). He has an apple at (1,3) (bottom left-ish?), (3,4), (5,4), (7,3), (8,1), (7,1), (5,1). He is in a cluster of apples. He will likely grow fast.\nI need to grow too.\nThe apple at (0,9) is safe for me to grab. No one else is close to it.\nThe apple at (6,8) is also somewhat close to me? (6,8) is top right quadrant. I am top left.\nDistance to (0,9): I am at (1,8). Manhattan distance = 2.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), distance = 1.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), distance = 1.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nIf I go UP (1,9):\n- I am at (1,9).\n- Enemy moves. Can he hit me? He is at (6,3). He needs to move 13 steps to reach me in one turn. Impossible.\n- Can I be blocked? No.\n- Future moves: From (1,9), I can go LEFT to (0,9). If I eat, I grow to size 3. Then I can go DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,8) (which will be my body).\n- If I go UP to (1,9), I am vulnerable to being trapped in the corner if I don't get the apple or if I get stuck behind my own tail.\n- However, getting the apple (0,9) is a sure point. It secures territory.\n\nIf I go DOWN (1,7):\n- I move toward the center of the board.\n- I see apples at (1,3) [down], (3,4), (5,4).\n- This gives me more space. But I lose the guarantee of the corner apple.\n- Enemy is near (6,3). He might move to (6,4) or (7,3). He is chasing apples there.\n- If I go DOWN, I can cut him off? No, he is far right (x=6), I am x=1. We are on opposite sides.\n\nIf I go LEFT (0,8):\n- I am against the wall.\n- Next turn I can go UP (0,9) to eat the apple.\n- From (0,9), I am in the corner. My body will be (0,8) and (1,8). I will be trapped. I must eat the apple to grow, and then I must be able to leave.\n- If I eat (0,9), I am size 3. Tail stays (I assume). Head (0,9), Body (0,8), Tail (1,8).\n- From (0,9), I can go DOWN to (0,8) (Body - DEATH), RIGHT to (1,9) (Empty? Yes). So I can exit the corner to (1,9).\n- It's a valid loop: (1,8) -> (0,8) -> (0,9) -> (1,9). This eats the apple and gets me out.\n\n**Comparing UP vs LEFT:**\n- UP (1,9): Leaves me on the edge. I can go LEFT to (0,9) next turn. Or DOWN to (1,8) (Body). Or RIGHT to (2,9).\n- LEFT (0,8): Leaves me against the wall. I can go UP (0,9) or DOWN (0,7).\n- The apple is at (0,9). Reaching it is the priority for growth.\n- Going LEFT puts me one step closer horizontally.\n- Going UP puts me one step closer vertically.\n- If I go LEFT to (0,8), I am at the wall. This limits my movement, but it also protects my flank (left side is wall). The enemy is on the right.\n- If I go UP to (1,9), I am at the top wall. Also protects top flank.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to get the apple at (0,9).\nFrom (1,8), moving LEFT to (0,8) is a direct move towards the apple and the wall. It sets up the collection.\nFrom (1,8), moving UP to (1,9) is also a direct move.\nHowever, looking at the board, (0,8) is empty. (1,9) is empty.\nThe apple at (0,9) is at the corner.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I am \"anchoring\" myself to the left edge.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I am \"anchoring\" myself to the top edge.\nThe next move after LEFT (0,8) is UP (0,9) to eat.\nThe next move after UP (1,9) is LEFT (0,9) to eat.\n\nIs there a difference in safety?\nIf I go LEFT (0,8):\nMy body will be (1,8).\nIf I go UP (0,9) next turn, I eat. My body becomes (0,8), (1,8).\nIf I then go RIGHT (1,9), I am safe.\nIf I stay in the corner, I die if I can't move.\n\nIf I go UP (1,9):\nMy body will be (1,8).\nIf I go LEFT (0,9) next turn, I eat. My body becomes (1,8), (2,8)? Wait, no.\nIf I am at (1,9) and body is (1,8).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,9) and eat:\nHead moves to (0,9).\nOld head (1,9) becomes body.\nOld body (1,8) becomes part of body (shift).\nSince I ate, I grow. The tail does not move.\nNew Body: [(1,9), (1,8)].\nFrom (0,9), I can go DOWN (0,8) or RIGHT (1,9).\n(1,9) is my body. (0,8) is empty (assuming I didn't move there).\nSo from (0,9), I am safe to go DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,9), that is my body (1,9). **DEATH.**\nIf I go DOWN to (0,8), that is empty.\n\nLet's trace the path for **LEFT** first:\nStart: Head (1,8), Body [(2,8)].\nMove 1 (This turn): LEFT -> (0,8).\nNew State: Head (0,8), Body [(1,8)] (Tail (2,8) drops off? Wait, size is 2. Head (1,8) -> Body. Tail (2,8) is removed).\nSo after LEFT: Head (0,8), Body [(1,8)].\nNext Turn: I want to eat (0,9).\nMove 2: UP -> (0,9).\nEat Apple. Grow.\nNew State: Head (0,9), Body [(0,8), (1,8)].\nFrom (0,9), options: DOWN (0,8 - Body), RIGHT (1,9 - Empty? Yes).\nI can move RIGHT to (1,9).\nState after Move 3: Head (1,9), Body [(0,9), (0,8)].\nI am free.\n\nPath for **UP** first:\nStart: Head (1,8), Body [(2,8)].\nMove 1 (This turn): UP -> (1,9).\nNew State: Head (1,9), Body [(1,8)].\nNext Turn: Eat (0,9).\nMove 2: LEFT -> (0,9).\nEat Apple. Grow.\nNew State: Head (0,9), Body [(1,9), (1,8)].\nFrom (0,9), options: DOWN (0,8 - Empty? Yes), RIGHT (1,9 - Body).\nI must go DOWN to (0,8).\nState after Move 3: Head (0,8), Body [(0,9), (1,9)].\nI am at (0,8). I can go DOWN (0,7) or UP (0,9 - Body). I must go DOWN.\n\nBoth paths are viable. Which is better for \"dominating\"?\nLeft moves me to the wall immediately. Up keeps me slightly more central (top row is still open to the right).\nHowever, the apple is at (0,9).\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I can see more of the board (Right side).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I commit to the corner.\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 8: ` . 0 T . . . A . . . `\nRow 9: ` A . . . . . . . . . `\nThere is an apple at (9,6) and (6,8). (6,8) is relatively close. Manhattan distance from (1,8) to (6,8) is 5.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I am closer to the center of the top row.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I am at the far left.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,3). He is chasing bottom/right apples.\nI should secure the top-left corner and then maybe sweep across the top?\nThe apple at (6,8) is a target. It is right above the enemy's general area.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I am moving away from (6,8) (distance increases to 6).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I am moving away from (6,8) (distance increases to 7).\n\nWait, I should secure the apple at (0,9) first. It's a free point.\nThe question is: which initial move sets me up best for the turn *after* I eat?\nIf I go LEFT (0,8) -> UP (0,9) -> RIGHT (1,9):\nI end at (1,9). My body is (0,9), (0,8). I am at the top left.\nIf I go UP (1,9) -> LEFT (0,9) -> DOWN (0,8):\nI end at (0,8). My body is (0,9), (1,9). I am at the left wall, just below the corner.\n\nEnding at (1,9) seems slightly better than (0,8) because (1,9) is not against the left wall, only the top wall. From (1,9), I can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. (LEFT is into the corner apple spot, but that's eaten).\nActually, after eating (0,9), (0,9) becomes my body. So from (1,9), if I go LEFT, I hit my body. So I lose LEFT option.\nFrom (1,9), I have DOWN (1,8) and RIGHT (2,9).\nFrom (0,8) (after the UP path), I have DOWN (0,7) and UP (0,9 - Body). So I only have DOWN.\n(1,9) has 2 options (DOWN, RIGHT). (0,8) has 1 option (DOWN).\nSo the **UP -> LEFT -> DOWN** path gives me more freedom on turn 4 (after eating) than the **LEFT -> UP -> RIGHT** path.\n\nLet's re-verify the path for **UP**:\nTurn 3: UP to (1,9). Body becomes (1,8).\nTurn 4: LEFT to (0,9). Eat. Body becomes (1,9), (1,8).\nTurn 5: I am at (0,9). I must move DOWN to (0,8) to survive.\nTurn 5 State: Head (0,8), Body (0,9), (1,9).\nFrom (0,8), I can go DOWN (0,7). (UP is body, LEFT is wall).\nSo I have 1 move (DOWN).\n\nLet's re-verify the path for **LEFT**:\nTurn 3: LEFT to (0,8). Body becomes (1,8).\nTurn 4: UP to (0,9). Eat. Body becomes (0,8), (1,8).\nTurn 5: I am at (0,9). I must move RIGHT to (1,9) or DOWN to (0,8). (0,8) is body. So I must go RIGHT to (1,9).\nTurn 5 State: Head (1,9), Body (0,9), (0,8).\nFrom (1,9), I can go DOWN (1,8) or RIGHT (2,9).\nSo I have 2 moves.\n\nOkay, the **LEFT** move this turn actually leads to a better position *after* eating the apple, assuming I take the optimal route.\nPath A (LEFT now): (1,8) -> (0,8) -> (0,9) -> (1,9). End at (1,9).\nPath B (UP now): (1,8) -> (1,9) -> (0,9) -> (0,8). End at (0,8).\n\n(1,9) is definitely better than (0,8). It has more mobility.\nTherefore, I should go **LEFT** this turn.\n\nIs there any other factor?\nThe enemy.\nEnemy is at (6,3). He is far away.\nMy move LEFT to (0,8) puts me on the edge.\nIs there any chance the enemy moves to (0,8)? No.\nIs there any apple I am missing? (1,3) is down-left. But (0,9) is closer and safer.\n\nWait, looking at the board state:\nRow 4: ` . . . A . A . . A . `\nRow 3: ` . A . . . . 1 A . . `\nRow 2: ` A . . . . . T . . . `\nRow 1: ` . . . . . A . A A . `\nRow 0: ` . . . . . . . . . A `\nApple at (1,3) is there.\nApple at (0,2) is there.\nApple at (0,9) is there.\n\nI am size 2. Enemy is size 2.\nIf I eat (0,9), I am size 3.\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8), I am setting up to eat (0,9) next turn.\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I am also setting up to eat (0,9) next turn.\n\nThe difference is the end position.\nLeft now -> End at (1,9) (High mobility).\nUp now -> End at (0,8) (Low mobility).\n\nI want high mobility. I want to box him in.\nBeing at (0,8) is stuck in the corner. Being at (1,9) is on the top row, ready to move right or down.\nSo **LEFT** is the correct move to secure the better position after eating.\n\nOne check:\nIf I go LEFT to (0,8).\nMy body is (1,8).\nThe enemy moves. Could he move to (1,8)? No, he is at (6,3).\nCould he move to (0,8)? No.\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nLet's write the rationale.\n\n**Rationale:**\nYo Chat! Turn 3. We're tied 1-1. The enemy is scrapping at the bottom right, but I see a guaranteed point right here in the top-left corner: (0,9). I'm moving **LEFT** to (0,8) to set up the grab. Why LEFT and not UP?\nIf I go UP to (1,9), I eat the apple next turn, but I'll end up trapped at (0,8) afterwards with only one way out (DOWN). If I go LEFT to (0,8) now, I eat the apple next turn, and I end up at (1,9) afterwards. From (1,9), I have TWO escape routes (DOWN and RIGHT). That's the mobility I need to stay aggressive. I'm boxing him in by controlling the top-left territory and keeping my options open. Let's secure that point!\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT",

My head is at **(0,9)** after grabbing that sweet apple last turn. My body is now at **(0,8)** and **(1,8)**. The enemy is still at **(7,2)**. We're winning 2-1!\n\nHere's the situation at (0,9) - the top-left corner:\n- **UP:** Off the board. \u274c DEAD.\n- **LEFT:** Off the board. \u274c DEAD.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (0,8). BUT WAIT! That's my own body! \u274c DEAD.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (1,9). This is safe! \u2705\n\nSo the only safe move is **RIGHT** to (1,9). Let's think about what happens next:\n- From (1,9), I'll have access to (2,9), (1,8), and (1,0) via wrapping? No wrapping, just open board space.\n- (1,9) is right next to an apple at (1,8)... but that's my body segment. Actually wait, looking at the board state, (1,8) is marked as 'T' which is my tail, but in the snake list it's listed as body. Let me check the board again...\n\nLooking at the board state:\n```\n9 0 . . . . . . . . .\n8 T T . . . . A . . .\n```\nSo (0,9) is my head (0), (0,8) and (1,8) are my body (T). The apple at (1,8) isn't there - the apple is at (0,2), (7,5), (9,0), etc. Looking at row 8: `(9, 6), (0, 2), (7, 5), (9, 0), (1, 3), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 8), (5, 4), (3, 4), (5, 1), (8, 4), (7, 3), (7, 7), (8, 2)` - no apple at (1,8).\n\nActually, I need to recalculate. My head is at (0,9). My body is at (0,8) and (1,8). The apple at (0,9) was eaten last turn. So (0,9) is now just my head.\n\nFrom (0,9), the only legal move is **RIGHT** to (1,9) because:\n- UP and LEFT are off board\n- DOWN goes into my body at (0,8)\n\nFrom (1,9), I'll have options. I can see apples at (1,3) and (3,4) in the future. The enemy is far away at (7,2). I need to start moving toward the center to control the board and force the enemy into a bad spot.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (1,9). From there, I'll likely move DOWN toward (1,8) (which will be free by then as my tail moves) and start navigating toward the apples in the center. I need to keep growing while staying mobile. The enemy is passive so far - I need to be aggressive and cut off his access to apples.\n\nRIGHT",

That's a trap! I'd be cornering myself and giving the enemy free reign on apples. BAD IDEA.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,9):** This is the POWER MOVE! \u2705\n- Opens up a HUGE corridor along the top row\n- From (2,9), I can go UP (off), DOWN to (2,8), LEFT to (1,9), or RIGHT to (3,9)\n- I'll have access to the apple cluster at (3,4) and (5,4) in the future\n- I'm moving AWAY from the enemy (who's at 8,2) to claim the left side of the board\n- This keeps me mobile and prevents getting boxed in\n\n**Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8,2) near apples at (9,4), (8,4), (7,3). He'll probably chase those apples. He's moving SLOW and passive. I need to grow FAST and dominate the board before he gets close.\n\n**My Strategy:** \n1. RIGHT to (2,9) - claim the top row corridor\n2. Navigate DOWN toward the apple cluster at (3,4) and (5,4)\n3. Force him into a tight spot where I can corner him\n4. If I get ahead in apples, look for head-on collision opportunities\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turn:** From (2,9), I'll likely go RIGHT to (3,9) to position for the apple at (3,4) eventually. Need to stay mobile and avoid getting trapped. Keep the enemy in the bottom-right quadrant while I dominate the top-left and center.\n\nChat, we're making this look EASY! RIGHT is the only move that gives me future freedom. Let's GO!\n\nRIGHT",

I'm chasing the enemy.\n\n**Immediate Moves from (2,9):**\n- **UP:** (2,10) - OFF BOARD \u274c DEAD\n- **DOWN:** (2,8) - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE\n- **LEFT:** (1,9) - MY OWN BODY \u274c DEAD (backwards)\n- **RIGHT:** (3,9) - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE\n\n**Analysis:**\nLEFT is suicide (backwards into my own body). UP is off the board. Only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe enemy is at (8,1) in the bottom-right. If I go RIGHT to (3,9), I'm moving away from him, extending my territory along the top. If I go DOWN to (2,8), I'm starting to descend toward the center and the apple clusters.\n\nBut here's the key: **I need to box him in.** The enemy is in the bottom-right quadrant. The board is 10x10. If I can control the center and the top, I can force him into a corner where he has no escape.\n\n**Long-term Planning:**\nIf I go DOWN now, I can start moving toward the center and eventually cut off his escape routes. From (2,8), I'll have access to (2,7), (1,8), (3,8) - I'll be in a much more central position to pressure him. Going RIGHT keeps me on the edge, which might give him more room.\n\n**The Plan:**\n1. **DOWN to (2,8)** - Move toward the center to start boxing him in\n2. From there, I can continue DOWN toward the apple clusters at (3,4) and (5,4)\n3. While he's in the bottom-right, I can take the left side and center\n4. Once I have more apples (I'm at 2, he's at 3), I can look for head-on collision opportunities\n\n**Enemy Prediction:** He's at (8,1). He might go UP to (8,2) but that's his own body (already there), or RIGHT to (9,1), or LEFT to (7,1). (7,1) has an apple. He'll likely go for that apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,8), I'm positioning to dominate the board while he's stuck in the corner. This is how we win - by controlling space.\n\nDOWN",

My body is at **(2,9)** and **(1,9)**. The enemy snake #1 is at **(7,1)** with his body at **(8,1), (8,2), (7,2), (6,2)**. He's got 4 apples, I've got 2 - I NEED TO CATCH UP!\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVE OPTIONS FROM (2,8):**\n- **UP:** (2,9) - MY OWN BODY! \u274c DEAD (backwards)\n- **DOWN:** (2,7) - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE  \n- **LEFT:** (1,8) - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE\n- **RIGHT:** (3,8) - EMPTY \u2705 SAFE\n\n**ELIMINATED MOVES:**\n- UP is suicide - I'd slam into my own tail at (2,9). Game over. NOPE.\n\n**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**\nNow I'm at (2,8) - I've got THREE safe moves. This is CRUCIAL. I'm in the driver's seat!\n\nWhere's the enemy? Bottom-right at (7,1). He's cornered in that quadrant with his own body creating a partial wall. I need to keep boxing him in while I hunt apples.\n\nLooking at the apple drops: (9,6), (0,2), (7,5), (9,0), (1,3), (6,8), (5,4), (3,4), (5,1), (8,4), (7,3), (7,7), (9,4), (5,9), (4,4)\n\nCLOSEST APPLES TO ME:\n- (1,3) - 5 squares away (left then down)\n- (3,4) - 4 squares away (down, down, down, right)\n- (5,4) - 6 squares away (down, down, right, right, right, down)\n\nBut CHAT, I'm not just chasing apples - I'm setting up the KILL ZONE!\n\n**THE PLAN:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,8), I'm:\n1. Moving toward the center-right side\n2. Getting CLOSER to apple at (3,4) and (5,4)\n3. Positioning to cut off any escape routes the enemy might have up toward the center\n4. Keeping my options OPEN for next turn (can go RIGHT, DOWN, or LEFT from there)\n5. Moving AWAY from my own body (good for growth)\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,7), I'm heading straight down toward the center but I'm staying on the far left edge - the enemy is on the far right. This gives him room to maneuver in the middle.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,8), I'm going even MORE left toward the corner, which might trap ME later.\n\n**THE MOVE:**\nRIGHT to (3,8)! This positions me in the upper-mid area, giving me access to the central apples while keeping pressure on the enemy's territory. From there, I can continue DOWN toward (3,4) or (5,4) to score points and grow my snake for the inevitable confrontation.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CHAT:**\n1. Take the center and left side\n2. Force the enemy into the bottom-right corner\n3. Grow to at least 4-5 apples so I have a size advantage\n4. Look for head-on collision when I'm bigger - I win that trade!\n\nLet's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",
